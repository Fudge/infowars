[00:00.000 --> 00:23.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Troyer here live from the Info Wars World Headquarters in Austin,
[00:23.160 --> 00:28.960]  Texas on this Wednesday, August 3, 2022, I'm going to give you a layout of what's coming
[00:28.960 --> 00:36.560]  up in the next four hours on the Alex Jones show. And then in the next segment, Alex is going to be,
[00:36.560 --> 00:42.800]  well, we're going to be playing a previously recorded segment from Alex with some updates.
[00:42.800 --> 00:48.760]  Well, I'll just leave it at that with some updates coming up in about six minutes. That's
[00:48.760 --> 00:53.360]  from Alex. Now quickly, I've got Bob Barnes in studio with me, or now known as Bobby Barnes,
[00:53.360 --> 00:59.280]  I guess, as he's gone back in time. He's Bobby Barnes now. He's going to be with me for the
[00:59.280 --> 01:04.120]  first two hours. We got all kinds of news to cover and discuss. We'll talk about the primary
[01:04.120 --> 01:10.480]  results from last night. I think there wasn't too much to take away from last night's primary
[01:10.480 --> 01:18.320]  results except for in one race. And that was the Arizona governor race. And I do believe we can
[01:18.320 --> 01:25.760]  take a very important data set from that, compare it to what we saw in 2020, and then do a little
[01:25.760 --> 01:31.440]  foresight into 2024. All the other ones are kind of, I don't really think too consequential as far
[01:31.440 --> 01:35.440]  as presidential elections are concerned, but the Arizona governor race, I believe was. So we'll
[01:35.440 --> 01:42.240]  discuss that as well as some other primary results from last night. We are in bizarro world. Okay.
[01:43.760 --> 01:48.160]  I don't even really know how to explain it. Whatever's going on with Nancy Pelosi in Taiwan
[01:48.160 --> 01:54.000]  right now is truly bizarro world stuff. China is now surrounding Taiwan. And I believe it's mostly
[01:54.000 --> 02:03.680]  just saber rattling, but you've got a drunken fool, Nancy Pelosi, an old hag flying over there to
[02:03.680 --> 02:11.680]  saber rattle and feel her oats, being in Congress for like 600 years now, going over there for a
[02:11.680 --> 02:20.000]  photo op, going over there to do insider trading with her and her husband's chip deals. And the
[02:20.000 --> 02:24.640]  White House says we don't stand with Taiwan. They tripled down on that yesterday. Then Biden said,
[02:24.640 --> 02:29.600]  no, we do stand for Taiwan independence after Kirby twice said they don't. Then they said,
[02:29.600 --> 02:33.120]  well, Pelosi is acting on her own. She's speaking on her own. She doesn't represent the country.
[02:33.120 --> 02:36.960]  She doesn't represent the Democrat party. Really? Cause she flew over there. I'm pretty sure on
[02:36.960 --> 02:43.840]  Air Force two was it? So that's interesting. That's just part of the bizarro world stuff that we have.
[02:44.960 --> 02:49.440]  Now I briefly mentioned this yesterday, but I, I caught, I caught a lot of flak yesterday
[02:49.440 --> 02:55.760]  after the show saying, why didn't you cover this? The al-Qaeda leader that they want to give Joe
[02:55.760 --> 03:03.040]  Biden credit for killing yesterday had been killed previously twice. Now again, I covered these
[03:03.040 --> 03:07.440]  stories and I actually read deeply into these stories. And I told you, if you read the stories,
[03:07.440 --> 03:12.560]  they actually admit that they're not positive. The guy was dead. Now they're saying they're
[03:12.560 --> 03:16.720]  positive. He's dead. I'm not telling you to trust these people when they said he was dead four years
[03:16.720 --> 03:21.120]  ago. I'm not telling you to trust these people when they say he's dead now. It's just more of the
[03:21.120 --> 03:25.760]  bizarro world. How many times do we have to kill this guy to give some politician a little
[03:26.480 --> 03:30.400]  popularity boost, which didn't work for Biden, by the way, if that was their plan.
[03:30.400 --> 03:37.760]  Although it's an odd thing to basically admit that you have turned over the country of Afghanistan
[03:37.760 --> 03:44.240]  to al-Qaeda, which is what led to this individual being hanging out on some sort of a patio like
[03:44.240 --> 03:49.120]  he's schmoozing in the French Quarter or something. And so they go hit him with this, this missile
[03:49.120 --> 03:54.560]  that chops him up. It's what we're told at least the CIA was tracking him folks, the CIA.
[03:54.560 --> 04:00.800]  So the CIA saw that he was dead twice before, never said anything. Now the CIA, who's obviously
[04:00.800 --> 04:06.560]  been monitoring this guy's activities for decades, now they say he's dead. So it's more bizarro world
[04:06.560 --> 04:14.560]  stuff there too. The Biden, what was the name of the act? The Inflation Reduction Act is going to
[04:14.560 --> 04:25.120]  increase inflation and increase your taxes. No, not just on the rich, but on everyone. So that's
[04:25.120 --> 04:31.360]  nice. Democrats just, they just hate you, I think is what the thing is. And then you have this whole
[04:31.920 --> 04:37.840]  let's shut off the energy to save the planet proposal that is really coming into fruition in
[04:37.840 --> 04:42.400]  Europe. And some countries are saying, okay, we're going to do it. Other countries are saying, no,
[04:42.400 --> 04:46.800]  we're not going to starve our people to death. And then what will America do? So that's all
[04:46.800 --> 04:52.160]  coming up. But Alex Jones coming up in the next segment. And then Bob Barnes joins me in studio.
[04:52.160 --> 05:16.240]  It's the Alex Jones show. Stay tuned for all the latest news and developments.

[05:57.040 --> 06:09.920]  friends, we're involved in an epic historic battle. And it's time for humanity to stand up
[06:09.920 --> 06:13.520]  in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this,
[06:13.520 --> 06:22.160]  but you want to fight, you better believe you got one. From the front lines of the information war,
[06:22.720 --> 06:24.160]  it's Alex Jones.
[06:36.000 --> 06:42.480]  It's Wednesday, August 3rd, 2022. I'm recording this at about 7am in the morning. Robert Barnes
[06:42.480 --> 06:46.160]  is about to take over with Owen Schroyer, and others, because I'm going to be in
[06:47.200 --> 06:54.720]  the so-called court of this judge here in Austin, Texas, who's fully weaponized his judiciary,
[06:55.520 --> 07:02.240]  and is doing things that no legal scholars that I've talked to say they've ever seen before.
[07:02.240 --> 07:09.760]  So this is the murder of justice if they're able to complete this fraud, and it'll affect everybody,
[07:09.760 --> 07:15.280]  not just in Texas, but across the United States as the left weaponizes the judiciary.
[07:15.840 --> 07:22.000]  But I wanted beforehand the baton to Robert Barnes just break down some of the amazing things
[07:22.000 --> 07:27.840]  that happened yesterday, because this was like something out of a Perry Mason episode. As many
[07:27.840 --> 07:32.960]  of you know when you tuned in yesterday, I said that I believe Scarlett Lewis is a real person,
[07:33.600 --> 07:38.800]  and I believe that Neil Heslund's a real person. I'm 100% sure of it now, because I didn't have a
[07:38.800 --> 07:45.200]  lot of questions previously after I spent a week with him in court and watched their mannerisms
[07:45.200 --> 07:50.080]  and heard them talk, and I said I'm really sorry that I ever did question Sandy Hook,
[07:50.720 --> 07:54.880]  because I can see that it really hurt their feelings. I'm not the guy that first questioned it,
[07:54.880 --> 07:58.720]  I didn't send people to harass them, I never sent their names until this trial started.
[07:59.600 --> 08:03.360]  Sure, the media's been lying, there's been a lot of disinformation, but it doesn't matter.
[08:03.360 --> 08:11.920]  I still hurt these people, and I had no idea that they were wanting to reach out to me and
[08:11.920 --> 08:16.720]  wanting to have closure for a long time until yesterday for sure. So let me tell you about
[08:16.720 --> 08:20.800]  the incredible thing that happened yesterday, but first let me tell you about the horrible thing.
[08:21.680 --> 08:28.560]  So, I just mentioned it. I'm on air yesterday for the first hour before I went down to court,
[08:28.560 --> 08:32.000]  because I thought they were going to have the psychologists and psychiatrists on until lunch,
[08:32.000 --> 08:37.600]  so I could go here, Neil Heslin and Scarlett Lewis after lunch, but they finished early,
[08:38.240 --> 08:43.440]  Heslin went on, he was upset that I wasn't there, I'm told, because he wanted to, you know,
[08:44.080 --> 08:51.520]  address me directly. Meanwhile, I did the first hour of the show, as everybody knows,
[08:51.520 --> 08:58.960]  and on that hour, I said what I just said earlier and the videos there for all to see,
[08:58.960 --> 09:05.680]  that I believe they're real people, that I believe she's real, someone edited that 10 minutes
[09:06.400 --> 09:13.120]  down to about a minute and a half and made it look like I was saying she wasn't real.
[09:13.120 --> 09:18.880]  They cut off where I say I think she's totally real, and when I apologized and then edited it to
[09:18.880 --> 09:25.440]  where it sounded like I was saying that Heslin was stupid, which is not what I said. I think he's
[09:25.440 --> 09:31.360]  very nice and very friendly and very old-fashioned. The guy's a bull rider, I mean the guy's really
[09:31.360 --> 09:41.120]  just a, you know, country boy, and so I said I believe they're being manipulated by these lawyers
[09:41.120 --> 09:47.200]  and by these big Democrat think tanks and gun control groups, and then, ladies and gentlemen,
[09:47.200 --> 09:54.640]  it all happened. So I said that on air, these different organizations edit the tape, bring it
[09:54.640 --> 09:59.920]  to her during a break, and say Alex Jones was attacking you the whole show saying you're deep
[09:59.920 --> 10:05.680]  state and not real, but here's just a clip of it. So they lied to her, told her I said all this,
[10:05.680 --> 10:11.360]  then showed her and edited two minute tape, then the judge let that be brought in, and the judge
[10:11.360 --> 10:17.120]  is now saying she's probably not gonna let us bring the full clip in. Whatever the law folks,
[10:18.400 --> 10:22.720]  you've got to play the full clip if someone who plays a small clip, especially if the small clip
[10:22.720 --> 10:29.040]  is not complete and is designed to confuse somebody. This is the very definition of why this should
[10:29.040 --> 10:34.800]  air. So I was saying I think they've been manipulated, I think they've been given edited tapes, I think
[10:34.800 --> 10:42.480]  they have been conditioned that I'm the devil and attacking them, and then they did the very thing
[10:42.480 --> 10:48.080]  that I was starting to figure out they'd done, and then it got worse. She gets on the stand
[10:48.080 --> 10:53.760]  and says, you've been attacking me for weeks, you've been saying I'm not real for the last
[10:53.760 --> 10:58.080]  few weeks, you said I'm not real today, she starts basically getting tears in her eyes,
[10:58.080 --> 11:05.840]  she believes it, but then I got on the stand and I said ma'am, they edited the front of the tape
[11:05.840 --> 11:09.200]  and the back of the tape, I said I think you're completely genuine and I'm sorry for your son's
[11:09.200 --> 11:16.000]  death, and I apologize, they edited that, and I said you need to find out who gave you that clip,
[11:16.000 --> 11:23.040]  and I have a scene suspicion who it is, and I pointed at her, you know, entourage and understand
[11:23.040 --> 11:30.720]  that I've never said your name until now, and I've never said your son's name, and I'm sorry if my
[11:30.720 --> 11:34.560]  questioning things hurt you, but you need to get to the bottom of what's really happening.
[11:36.240 --> 11:41.360]  Then at the end of the day after the judge chewed me out and called me a liar and did all this other
[11:41.360 --> 11:48.720]  crazy stuff, it's a whole other subject, Scarlett Lewis, we're waiting for them to leave because
[11:48.720 --> 11:53.920]  we don't want to, you know, get in their way of, and they come over to our table and she has a bottle
[11:53.920 --> 11:57.360]  of water and a cough drop for me because I've got some laryngitis, everybody's noticed on
[11:57.360 --> 12:03.840]  the area of torn larynx, I got to get it worked on soon, and I shook her hand, I said I'm sorry,
[12:04.480 --> 12:08.560]  she said I understand, she has tears in her eyes, and the old Hezlen came over, I shook his hand,
[12:08.560 --> 12:14.080]  and I said please find out who edited the tape, please see the real tape, I said, you know, see
[12:14.080 --> 12:19.760]  the fourth segment of my show yesterday, please, and they were nodding and Hezlen had tears in his
[12:19.760 --> 12:26.320]  eyes, and all of a sudden the lawyers jumped in between us and they go, they go, this isn't gonna
[12:26.320 --> 12:34.000]  happen, this isn't going on, no way, and everybody can see the tape, see the video, and even
[12:34.000 --> 12:43.440]  national media is now saying that I yelled at Hezlen that he was autistic again, which I didn't
[12:43.440 --> 12:49.200]  do, one of the lawyers said I've got an autistic son just injecting that, and I said well maybe
[12:49.200 --> 12:56.320]  I'm autistic too, but the whole point was they're being manipulated, and we caught this all happening
[12:56.320 --> 13:04.240]  red-handed, then it got even worse, anybody who was watching saw it on TV, the judge stopped
[13:04.240 --> 13:11.600]  the last 30 minutes of my testimony, pushes the jury out and looks at me and says you lied on the
[13:11.600 --> 13:21.520]  stand, you said you're bankrupt, and she said, and you lied and said you complied with discovery,
[13:21.520 --> 13:28.960]  and I said well in my view I did, and in my view I am bankrupt, I'm out of money, and we have filed
[13:28.960 --> 13:36.080]  for it, and she said I'm gonna instruct the jury that you're a liar tomorrow, I mean it's unprecedented,
[13:36.080 --> 13:41.280]  then she ordered my lawyer to violate attorney-client privilege and tell her about our private
[13:41.280 --> 13:47.520]  conversations, which is just unprecedented, I mean this is like a turn to force about
[13:47.520 --> 13:52.960]  to violate people's rights, it's unbelievable, and I just feel sorry for everybody, including
[13:52.960 --> 13:57.760]  these whacked out leftist and lawyers and the judge, I mean they are all just over the deep end
[13:58.560 --> 14:02.880]  and have no idea what they've done, she also made this really weird statement where she said you
[14:02.880 --> 14:10.560]  believe everything you say is the truth, but it's not the truth, I decide what the truth is, wow,
[14:12.240 --> 14:16.800]  but that's my defense right there, I do believe that I'm trying to tell the truth, I don't believe
[14:16.800 --> 14:22.000]  everything I say is the truth, we're all infallible, we're all human, we're all sinners, but they all
[14:22.000 --> 14:27.520]  know I meant this, they all know that most of the time these big things happen, there's some kind of
[14:27.520 --> 14:31.760]  weird stuff going on, they all know Jesse Smollett didn't happen, they all know WMDs and Iraq didn't
[14:31.760 --> 14:36.160]  happen, they all know the Gulf of Taunton didn't happen, I mean they all know Operation Northwood
[14:36.160 --> 14:40.640]  was a plan to stage the deaths of kids and bombings and shooting people and blowing up airplanes,
[14:40.640 --> 14:48.560]  I mean they all know that most Americans question JFK, 90% national polls, so Robert Barnes going
[14:48.560 --> 14:53.680]  to take over, he's going to get the trial because it's so historic, the first of a whole bunch of
[14:53.680 --> 14:57.920]  show trials and then he's going to cover World News, what's happening in Ukraine, what's happening
[14:57.920 --> 15:02.000]  with Hunter Biden, what's happening with Pelosi and just what's happening with the borders,
[15:02.000 --> 15:07.440]  got a big show lined up for you David, please pray for us and please just pray that the truth
[15:07.440 --> 15:11.520]  you know gets the American people so that this type of deception can stop because
[15:12.240 --> 15:15.280]  they're accusing me of being a mastermind and being all deceptive and things,
[15:16.480 --> 15:19.360]  this is deception and they've literally got these parents
[15:21.680 --> 15:27.280]  in a bubble feeding them disinformation and manipulating them and it felt so good to shake
[15:27.280 --> 15:35.680]  Heslin's hand and shake Scott Lewis' hand and to see how scared and panic the lawyers that have
[15:35.680 --> 15:40.240]  been controlling them were inside the court and outside the court because they were waiting like
[15:40.240 --> 15:45.600]  hyenas when I came out and they all were trying to smile and act you know powerful and act like
[15:45.600 --> 15:50.320]  they were you know cool guys in junior high or something but their eyes all looked extremely
[15:50.320 --> 15:56.400]  fearful because they know their house of cards is imploding, the truth is coming out, infowars.com

[19:01.440 --> 19:08.480]  epitome of free speech than right here and that's what people recognize and resonate with
[19:08.480 --> 19:13.680]  and as Ward said you're not going to find a better place for information. You might not agree with
[19:13.680 --> 19:17.680]  everything, you might not agree with all our perspectives, but we cover all the information
[19:18.240 --> 19:21.920]  and there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here, thank you for that Ward.
[19:21.920 --> 19:26.880]  infowarsstore.com by the way the products he mentions infowarsstore.com is where to get them
[19:26.880 --> 19:32.240]  folks and we do have the best supplements, I mean just like we try our best with our news coverage
[19:32.240 --> 19:38.640]  and our information, we do the best with our supplements as well. I mean look at the hair
[19:38.640 --> 19:44.320]  and beard support formula, folks this is a joke, I mean we're giving this thing away at 75% off,
[19:44.320 --> 19:49.520]  by the way it works for me in case you haven't noticed. The hair and beard formula is working
[19:49.520 --> 19:56.880]  for me, quite well I might add, quite well my barber appreciates hair and beard support for
[19:56.880 --> 20:05.680]  men, I go and see them quite often now. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[20:05.680 --> 20:17.840]  it's Alex Jones.
[20:17.840 --> 20:32.880]  You can run on for a long time, run on for a long time, run on for a long time, sooner or
[20:32.880 --> 20:38.320]  later you've got to cut you down. We're back in studio now on Troyer and Bob Barnes,
[20:38.320 --> 20:45.760]  this is Alex Jones in court today, we'll just leave it at that Bobby Barnes won't we and let's
[20:45.760 --> 20:51.680]  get into the bizarro world that we're in right now, let's go down the stack of news, let me first
[20:51.680 --> 20:57.600]  start with this to kind of just get us going here, pull fines only 1% of Americans see Russia as a
[20:57.600 --> 21:03.680]  major problem, all the propaganda, all the time spent, all the demonizing, all the blaming,
[21:04.800 --> 21:09.360]  1% of Americans see Russia as a problem, that tells me the propaganda is not working,
[21:10.320 --> 21:15.360]  but it also tells me that the Democrats don't care and the media don't care, they're going to
[21:15.360 --> 21:21.440]  continue to push their Russia BS narratives even though nobody cares, most people probably can't
[21:21.440 --> 21:25.120]  even find Ukraine on a map, they might not even be able to find Russia either. Well I mean there's
[21:25.120 --> 21:29.920]  a scene from the Lord of War where the character, the brother of Nicholas Cage's character, the
[21:29.920 --> 21:34.400]  merchant of death that Biden's thinking about sending back now to Russia in exchange. Oh that was
[21:34.400 --> 21:38.640]  that was based on him? Yes, I did not know that. And remember his brother does that, he's doing so
[21:38.640 --> 21:44.080]  much cocaine, he does a whole map of Ukraine in cocaine and basically that's Zelensky on a daily
[21:44.080 --> 21:48.640]  basis, I mean that's how he's doing his life. Interesting. So the, I mean his wife reportedly
[21:48.640 --> 21:53.680]  is already here in the US, he's got property in Miami, close to a billion dollars disclosed in
[21:53.680 --> 21:57.520]  the Pandora papers, all the different information and little entities, I mean this is a guy who
[21:57.520 --> 22:01.680]  so believes in his country, he has pretty much none of his money or assets in the country. There it is.
[22:01.680 --> 22:06.480]  So the whole thing is a crock, it's a joke, it's an embarrassment, Russia's going to win, there's
[22:07.440 --> 22:12.320]  the mythology that Russia was losing was some of the worst intelligence reports,
[22:12.320 --> 22:18.080]  since the killing yesterday of the third or fourth or fifth version of killing Al-Zahari.
[22:18.080 --> 22:22.000]  However many Al-Zaharis there are. I mean, reportedly Joe Biden and they brought it,
[22:22.000 --> 22:26.640]  they had so much time because he's just chilling, Al-Zahari, he's like, hey, I've got Taliban's
[22:26.640 --> 22:31.600]  now back in control, I'm going to just chill on my balcony, drink my little tea, say hi to the
[22:31.600 --> 22:36.320]  neighbors, hit on the, hit on the local girls when you can see their eyes, you know, that kind of
[22:36.320 --> 22:40.880]  thing. Maybe take a go at the goat down the street. Yeah, yeah, all of that and it has all this
[22:40.880 --> 22:45.200]  free time, so much so that he's out in public, this guy's been in hiding for 25 years, but he's
[22:45.200 --> 22:49.360]  out in public now just, you know, smiling at everybody, supposedly, so much time that they
[22:49.360 --> 22:52.960]  could build a little model building and they could build the model building and take it into
[22:52.960 --> 22:58.160]  Biden because Biden is so careful and conscientious about like not killing seven people and aid worker
[22:58.160 --> 23:03.840]  and their entire family say just last year. With a mistaken, a case of mistaken identity?
[23:03.840 --> 23:07.680]  Exactly, he's really careful, in fact, he's so careful he wants to make sure that there's no
[23:07.680 --> 23:12.240]  construction damage that could cause any damage to anybody, so they've created a little mini building,
[23:12.240 --> 23:16.480]  they take in this little mini building and he looks at it and says, how's the lighting?
[23:16.480 --> 23:20.560]  What's the weather like? How do we make sure the materials don't, because they can predict the
[23:20.560 --> 23:26.320]  weather? Yeah, of course, of course they can't, so they, and they had time to do all of this and he
[23:26.320 --> 23:30.320]  had time to take care and before they did it, he had to check off everything to make sure it was
[23:30.320 --> 23:34.240]  the right drone weapon, even though their drone weapon, as you note, that they disclose they use
[23:34.240 --> 23:39.840]  this, not exactly the kind you use to be precise. Yeah, it's more of a large destruction, it's not
[23:39.840 --> 23:43.760]  massive scale, but it's more than just you're trying to hit one person, you're doing significant
[23:43.760 --> 23:47.600]  damage. Well, remember the smart bombs? Remember that? Always murder the line from Wag the Dog.
[23:47.600 --> 23:52.080]  What's interesting is, you know, you have Alex Jones in the trial that will not be named in the
[23:52.080 --> 23:58.000]  courtroom that cannot be talked about today and you look at the broad scope of concerns, look
[23:58.000 --> 24:03.280]  at what Wag the Dog did. Wag the Dog made fun of all of the claims that our governments have
[24:03.280 --> 24:07.360]  related to war and the precision and their official narrative on these kind of events.
[24:07.360 --> 24:12.240]  Here you have the official narrative is, okay, no, he didn't die of natural deaths in 2016.
[24:12.240 --> 24:15.920]  Okay, no, he didn't actually kill him, though he said we did in 2020.
[24:15.920 --> 24:20.160]  Now we really got him. This time we really, really got him now. And he got it a story that
[24:20.160 --> 24:24.480]  all sounds ridiculous. And it reminds me of this. And the timing, don't forget about the timing,
[24:24.480 --> 24:29.440]  Biden's approval ratings crashing, Biden's popularity crashing. He hasn't had a victory in
[24:29.440 --> 24:33.680]  years. They had to give him something. He's celebrating low gas prices. They're still record
[24:33.680 --> 24:37.840]  highs. They had to give him something. Well, especially an intelligence community that's
[24:37.840 --> 24:41.920]  been made a joke at over the last two years, they were completely wrong about what would happen in
[24:41.920 --> 24:46.480]  Afghanistan. They were completely wrong about what would happen in Ukraine. Completely wrong
[24:46.480 --> 24:51.840]  about what would happen vis-a-vis Russia and the economic war against them. Completely wrong about
[24:51.840 --> 24:56.720]  what was happening in aspects of China and Taiwan and North Korea. So they need to say,
[24:56.720 --> 25:00.480]  see, we're useful. See, we're important. We can still find the terrorists. We said we killed
[25:00.480 --> 25:05.040]  four years ago and kill them again. And that's sort of the narrative in the pitch in the main
[25:05.040 --> 25:10.000]  line. But it reminds me to wag the dog also because I always thought Clinton was winking at the world
[25:10.000 --> 25:17.440]  when in 1999 he goes in and bombs Serbia. And the basis on doing so is refugees fleeing
[25:17.440 --> 25:23.680]  in the winter. And women refugees fleeing, Albanian women refugees fleeing. The irony of that
[25:23.680 --> 25:30.240]  is that was in fact the entire premise of wag the dog. A president caught in a sex scandal creates
[25:30.240 --> 25:37.440]  a fake war with Albania based on a fake refugee fleeing conflict from the other side. And yet
[25:37.440 --> 25:41.440]  that he, I mean, Clinton just re-scripted. He took the script and he's like, watch this,
[25:41.440 --> 25:45.520]  I'm going to take wag the dog. I'm going to do it for real. And nobody's going to say boo about it.
[25:45.520 --> 25:49.200]  And that's exactly what happened. And now we're seeing Biden do the same thing. So Clinton does
[25:49.200 --> 25:54.160]  still have another advantage over Biden. Biden has redefined vaccine, redefined recession,
[25:54.160 --> 25:59.200]  redefined inflation. But as Clinton pointed out in a popular meme, he still hasn't managed to
[25:59.200 --> 26:03.760]  redefine what the word is, is. And so Clinton still has the top of new definitions that are
[26:03.760 --> 26:07.840]  going on in the country. But all of this, what it shows with Russia, what it shows to Ukraine,
[26:07.840 --> 26:12.960]  is that our elites don't know what they're doing. They don't understand the world,
[26:12.960 --> 26:16.160]  and they're going to risk World War III in the process because they're that incompetent,
[26:16.160 --> 26:21.840]  that incapable. I mean, they sent a drunk idiot to Taiwan knowing it might risk war with China.
[26:21.840 --> 26:27.360]  Yeah, that's to me the next bizarro world event that we're covering here today. But the headline
[26:27.360 --> 26:32.640]  from Town Hall, I think sums it up. Joe Biden's Afghan drone strike won't save Dems from midterm
[26:32.640 --> 26:37.120]  pain. That's what this is all about. It was all about the Democrat Party. It was all about Joe
[26:37.120 --> 26:42.160]  Biden's approval. It was all about trying to give him a win. And it didn't, it didn't give him a win.
[26:42.160 --> 26:47.360]  And even if it's true that they've killed this guy finally for the third or fourth time or whatever
[26:47.360 --> 26:55.520]  it is, even if that's true, the narrative coming out sacrifices that you turned Afghanistan over
[26:55.520 --> 27:00.480]  to Al Qaeda and the Taliban, there's no way of getting around that. But yeah, for folks that
[27:00.480 --> 27:08.960]  are just tuning in here, Al Zahari has been declared dead multiple times before 2016, 2020,
[27:08.960 --> 27:14.400]  now 2022. I've got all the news stories in in front of me from over the years where he was
[27:14.400 --> 27:27.520]  declared dead. Here it is in 21. Here it is in 2020. And yeah, it just, it just, it goes on from there.
[27:27.520 --> 27:31.840]  And by the way, they have no DNA proof. They claim to have video proof. But I haven't seen
[27:31.840 --> 27:37.520]  any of that video proof yet. And this is why people are skeptical of governmental and institutional
[27:37.520 --> 27:43.520]  narratives. Ever since the Kennedy assassination on major events, they are usually more often than
[27:43.520 --> 27:47.120]  not, you can assume they're lying to us. Because more often than not, that's what it turned out
[27:47.120 --> 27:51.760]  to be. Just like what exactly was the Defense Department, along with the Secret Service,
[27:51.760 --> 27:56.320]  as soon as Biden comes in, what's the first thing they're doing on their phones related to what
[27:56.320 --> 28:01.920]  they were up to against Trump after the election? And January 6th, delete, delete, delete, delete.
[28:01.920 --> 28:05.680]  Oh yeah, we got that story. We got that story coming up today, too.
[28:05.680 --> 28:09.920]  And you look at that, you look at the elections. Now there's some good news yesterday, some white
[28:09.920 --> 28:15.360]  pill moments yesterday. Kerry Lake came back in Arizona. It looks like that is a, the most
[28:15.360 --> 28:20.000]  significant election for 2024. As you were mentioning earlier, big win by Blake Masters,
[28:20.000 --> 28:25.760]  big win by John Gibbs, knocking off Peter Meyer, that pro impeachment person. Eric Schmidt,
[28:25.760 --> 28:29.120]  probably a decent candidate, kind of endorsed by Trump, wins in Missouri.
[28:29.120 --> 28:33.360]  Yeah, that was an interesting one. Yes. Well, we'll cover all the primary news coming up
[28:33.360 --> 28:39.200]  as well. But when we come back, I want to get into the situation with Pelosi in Taiwan and China
[28:39.200 --> 28:45.520]  is so bizarro world. And it just shows how dangerous Nancy Pelosi is that she would risk
[28:45.520 --> 28:52.160]  the entire safety of the planet for her own ego, for her own ego and her own profit. Nancy Pelosi
[28:52.160 --> 28:56.640]  would potentially start World War three. That woman is a threat to humanity.
[28:56.640 --> 29:04.640]  Info Wars has been vindicated. We've been proven right. World government, the new world order
[29:04.640 --> 29:11.040]  is out of the open. And now more than ever, the forces of Satan are trying to shut down this
[29:11.040 --> 29:17.280]  broadcast. The forces of anti human, godless new world order are out of control. So now realize,
[29:17.840 --> 29:22.160]  we have pushed them out of the light. We have pushed them out in the open and they are so upset
[29:22.160 --> 29:26.880]  and they are so scared. So while you still can, because any day can be our last broadcast, spread
[29:26.880 --> 29:31.680]  the word about the show, share the article, share the videos and please fund us while getting great

[32:09.840 --> 32:16.640]  number one cause of marital splits is that there is problems in the bedroom and the number one
[32:16.640 --> 32:22.640]  issue men have is erectile dysfunction. Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes about this
[32:22.640 --> 32:27.120]  because they don't want people having lasting good love and relationships. They want to break up
[32:27.120 --> 32:34.960]  society. We are so excited to have the number one natural male enhancement pill in the world

[33:00.720 --> 33:06.720]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:06.720 --> 33:22.560]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report. If you are receiving this transmission,
[33:22.560 --> 33:31.520]  you are the resistance. And now your host, Owen Shroyer. I'm really at a loss at this situation
[33:31.520 --> 33:35.760]  with Pelosi, China and Taiwan. I want to just read through these headlines and get Bob Barnes
[33:35.760 --> 33:40.000]  to weigh in on it here. Maybe we can try to make sense of it. The most sense I can make of it is
[33:40.000 --> 33:47.520]  that Nancy Pelosi is drunk on power out of her mind in her old age. Maybe she's got some dementia
[33:47.520 --> 33:52.000]  or something else going on and she's been corrupt for 50 plus years. And so now she just sees this
[33:52.000 --> 33:57.840]  as her last kind of go. Might as well make the most obvious insider trading deal on ships worth
[33:57.840 --> 34:02.800]  billions of dollars I can before my time as a congresswoman is over. My husband just got caught
[34:02.800 --> 34:06.880]  with drugs and alcohol and system driving. But don't worry, we got that dropped. Here's some of
[34:06.880 --> 34:12.320]  the headlines. China summons USA Ambassador overnight says Washington must pay the price.
[34:12.320 --> 34:18.960]  That's for Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. And I guess Pelosi saying Taiwan is independent while the rest
[34:18.960 --> 34:23.200]  of the Democrat Party in the White House says they aren't. Taiwan accuses Beijing of air and
[34:23.200 --> 34:28.640]  sea blockade. China has completely surrounded the island now. After Pelosi departure, China
[34:28.640 --> 34:35.200]  surrounds Taiwan. And then I'm not surprised by this, but I just think it's an added element here.
[34:35.840 --> 34:41.680]  CNN, CNBC and Associated Press Bureau chiefs meet with Chinese Communist Party propaganda
[34:41.680 --> 34:47.760]  group in July. So maybe they were even planning this whole thing and having a roll out in the media.
[34:49.200 --> 34:55.520]  But I don't even know what to make of this, honestly. It's Nancy Pelosi in her own arrogance
[34:55.520 --> 35:01.280]  with her own ego making this trip to Taiwan potentially could start a larger conflict.
[35:01.280 --> 35:05.600]  This is our world war star. And I mean, believe me, last thing I want to do is
[35:06.320 --> 35:10.320]  see Nancy Pelosi in office for another minute. But I also don't want to see her plane get
[35:10.320 --> 35:16.000]  struck down. That would probably be worse, actually. And so she goes over there. The White
[35:16.000 --> 35:21.040]  House and John Kirby speaking the White House three times say we don't believe in Taiwanese
[35:21.040 --> 35:25.200]  independence. This was after Joe Biden said that they did and they would stand with Taiwan. So he
[35:25.200 --> 35:31.280]  lied about that or they're lying now. Either way, they're lying. And so China says, well,
[35:31.280 --> 35:36.080]  wait a second, Pelosi goes over here, says Taiwan is independent. That's a direct affront to China.
[35:36.080 --> 35:40.400]  So you must pay the price. I mean, where are we at here, Bob? I mean, this is just total
[35:40.400 --> 35:45.520]  insane clown world stuff. Our politicians are behaving like lunatics. But what you have is
[35:45.520 --> 35:49.600]  sort of a quartet of perspectives. One is sort of what's going on in the Biden administration.
[35:49.600 --> 35:54.080]  The other is what's going on with George Soros, Klaus Schwab and the globalist cadre.
[35:54.080 --> 35:57.920]  Another is what's going on in China. And another is what's going on in Taiwan.
[35:57.920 --> 36:01.440]  Let's start with the Biden administration. Biden administration really believes that
[36:01.440 --> 36:05.520]  they can topple any government they want any time they want. They believe that they are in
[36:05.520 --> 36:10.400]  control, not anyone else. That's why they thought that the Ukraine war would be an easy win for
[36:10.400 --> 36:15.680]  their puppets in Ukraine and a massive economic defeat for Russia that was going to lead to
[36:15.680 --> 36:20.720]  complete regime change in Russia. Didn't happen. But I believe they thought the same thing here.
[36:20.720 --> 36:25.200]  Pelosi goes over there, rattles a few cages, Xi gets toppled, and they get someone that they
[36:25.200 --> 36:30.480]  think is more docile, more subservient, more corrupt, more complicit with them and their
[36:30.480 --> 36:34.400]  interests. And that aligns with the globalist interest, George. Do you think Pelosi really
[36:34.400 --> 36:38.080]  believed that? Yes. So I have no doubt. I mean, these people are she's that out of her mind.
[36:38.080 --> 36:42.720]  That they're completely that out of their mind. They believe ludicrous. They believe insane
[36:42.720 --> 36:48.160]  things. I mean, yeah, men are women. Exactly. Well, I mean, an example, that's where some of
[36:48.160 --> 36:53.040]  them align with aspects of Taiwan. The current Taiwan independence movement, the group that
[36:53.040 --> 36:59.200]  runs it is kind of woke. They have like a, you know, a gender confused individual as a high
[36:59.200 --> 37:03.680]  ranking official in the new independence Taiwan, right? So you got this weird dynamic dynamic
[37:03.680 --> 37:07.760]  going on with Taiwan independence. You got old school Taiwan independence that just don't want
[37:07.760 --> 37:13.360]  anything to do with the CCP and other ones that want to be woke stir, you know, sunflower movement
[37:13.360 --> 37:17.760]  kind of crowd. So that has its own little dynamic that throws a wrench in everything. And then you
[37:17.760 --> 37:22.480]  have China. And the issue with China is China is no longer willing to be the globalist factory
[37:22.480 --> 37:26.800]  worker and keep their head down. The globalists love them as long as they are doing the bidding
[37:26.800 --> 37:31.760]  of globalists doing the agenda, using it as an experiment on how to socially control people
[37:31.760 --> 37:36.720]  with a social credit system and all the rest. But once China decided to be independent of
[37:36.720 --> 37:41.200]  Klaus Schwab and George Soros and do whatever they felt they were interested in doing,
[37:41.200 --> 37:45.280]  that upset them and they wanted to bring them back to you. Not to mention not to get you off
[37:45.280 --> 37:48.640]  track because I want you to stay on the track. But now China and Russia are starting to form a
[37:48.640 --> 37:52.080]  little alliance, a little partnership that is a huge threat to the globalists.
[37:52.080 --> 37:56.480]  Well, this is why Putin, this is why Trump said getting into a war with Putin in Ukraine made no
[37:56.480 --> 38:01.680]  sense. And this is why Trump says what Pelosi is doing in Taiwan makes no sense. Because Trump is
[38:01.680 --> 38:08.160]  like all you're doing is creating the key allies, our adversaries and forcing them into an alignment,
[38:08.160 --> 38:12.640]  an economic alignment, a political alignment, a military alignment. And what is that going to
[38:12.640 --> 38:17.680]  do? That could break the back. You have one of the biggest fuel and food and fertilizer suppliers
[38:17.680 --> 38:22.720]  in the world, the biggest nuclear arsenal in the world, one of the biggest militaries in the world,
[38:22.720 --> 38:28.160]  aligning with the biggest manufacturer in the world, the biggest supply chain monopolizer
[38:28.160 --> 38:32.400]  in the world, the biggest, by the way, the biggest provider of everything that goes into
[38:32.400 --> 38:37.040]  electric batteries and solar panels. That's who climate change politics helps. It helps China.
[38:37.040 --> 38:40.400]  But China doesn't care that much about it. That's why it keeps turning on the coal factories.
[38:40.400 --> 38:46.080]  That's just and by the way, the China. China is a total proof that the carbon emission
[38:46.800 --> 38:52.240]  net neutrality or whatever it is is BS. The more carbon they emit, the more forestation they have
[38:52.240 --> 38:57.120]  in China. Yeah, oh, exactly. They don't they only believe not that it's I mean, their air is polluted.
[38:57.120 --> 39:01.600]  Don't get me wrong. They have a pollution problem. But I'm just saying this whole carbon emissions
[39:01.600 --> 39:06.800]  causes global warming or the earth to die is just not true. Exactly. Like the current Biden
[39:06.800 --> 39:11.200]  budget package that encourages and incentivizes with tax credits and other financially lucrative
[39:11.200 --> 39:16.400]  deals, the climate change green economics actually enriches and empowers China. So it's like there's
[39:16.400 --> 39:21.680]  these contradictory messages coming out. And the reason I think is they have no problem with the
[39:21.680 --> 39:26.640]  CCP running China. They have no problem with China continuing to dominate manufacturing and
[39:26.640 --> 39:32.080]  monopolize supply chains. Their concern is China being economically and politically and militarily
[39:32.080 --> 39:36.160]  independent of the globalist interest, such as what happened in terms of them aligning with Russia
[39:36.160 --> 39:39.680]  in the Ukrainian conflict. So they want to punish them and discipline them. And what they don't
[39:39.680 --> 39:44.560]  understand is this is not the China of 2000. We are no longer in that position. And that was Trump's
[39:44.560 --> 39:49.520]  point. We got to focus on economics with China and not get into a war with China. We got to focus
[39:49.520 --> 39:54.160]  on separating Russia from China and then having Russia aligned with us rather than China. And
[39:54.160 --> 39:59.360]  because what does China need? It needs food and it needs fuel because it in it has to import them
[39:59.360 --> 40:04.800]  at massive levels. Who can provide it? Russia. If Russia is aligned with us, we have real leverage
[40:04.800 --> 40:09.360]  on China. Trump was that close to a peace deal with North Korea. But for John Bolton interfering
[40:09.360 --> 40:14.640]  and interrupting, thanks to that nitwit CIA hack, John Hannity, who disguises himself as a news
[40:14.640 --> 40:19.440]  broadcaster on Fox News. He does wear the CIA emblem on his lapel. I mean, oddly does. I mean,
[40:19.440 --> 40:24.160]  it's like the guy's really hiding it. He is the reason John Bolton got in the White House. He's
[40:24.160 --> 40:28.800]  admitted this. He's conceded this publicly. So I think it reflects and reveals we have one of the
[40:28.800 --> 40:33.680]  most incompetent administrations in American history. People like, oh my gosh, that's not even close.
[40:33.680 --> 40:38.720]  Oh, in fact, that's what people like the Durand. People can follow them at the durand.locals.com.
[40:38.720 --> 40:42.480]  Alexander of course, just the other day was laying out the reason why China's paranoid
[40:42.480 --> 40:46.800]  is because of the early 1800s. The Brits came and forced opium on their people. The various
[40:46.800 --> 40:52.480]  empires were divvying up the great China's China civilization. They are paranoid of that happening
[40:52.480 --> 40:57.440]  again. They're not afraid of Taiwan or Taiwan's independence. They are afraid of a NATO base
[40:57.440 --> 41:02.960]  being located on Taipei 100 kilometers from from the Chinese shore, especially with the
[41:02.960 --> 41:07.200]  Chinese military expansion into the South China Sea and everything they're trying to do right
[41:07.200 --> 41:13.440]  there militarily. But just let's finish it off with Pelosi. I still just, I can't even believe
[41:13.440 --> 41:18.720]  it. Is she really that out of her mind? Is she really that drunk on ego? Is she really that drunk
[41:18.720 --> 41:25.360]  on power that she would fly over there for her own self satisfaction and risk potentially starting
[41:25.360 --> 41:29.600]  a larger conflict with China? Well, the answer to the Nancy Pelosi question is the same as Hunter
[41:29.600 --> 41:33.920]  Thompson's answer to Bill Clinton, which is the Hunter Thompson famously said, the question
[41:33.920 --> 41:38.960]  isn't what Bill Clinton is addicted to. It's, is there anything he's not addicted to? And with
[41:38.960 --> 41:43.920]  Nancy Pelosi, the question isn't whether she's drunk on power, drunk on ego or drunk in general.
[41:43.920 --> 41:48.480]  The question is not what she is drunk on is when is she not drunk? Or how drunk is she? Exactly.
[41:48.480 --> 41:54.720]  And I think the reality is that she will literally has the capacity to lead us bumbling and stumbling
[41:54.720 --> 42:00.000]  into another global world war, much as we got into in World War One. World War One was a
[42:00.000 --> 42:05.120]  bumbling, stumbling, tripping into the war that led, by the way, to the death of four empires
[42:05.120 --> 42:10.080]  that had been, that had lasted for as long as eight centuries before they were wiped out in four
[42:10.080 --> 42:15.680]  years. That's the kind of incompetence we have. We have a combination of intransigence and incompetence
[42:15.680 --> 42:19.920]  in the White House. We have a guy who's not only admittedly dumb, he's now a dementia candidate
[42:19.920 --> 42:24.480]  running the most powerful country in the world. And that's what you get a drunk Nancy Pelosi,
[42:24.480 --> 42:29.440]  bumbling and stumbling us into risk of World War Three. Literally, she probably smells like a brewery
[42:29.440 --> 42:36.080]  as she, that, that witch smile as she gets off the plane, waving to all the people of the planet,
[42:36.080 --> 42:42.160]  making it all about her doing insider trading. And now the situation with China is even worse.
[42:43.280 --> 42:48.240]  So it's crazy, folks. These are our leaders. These are our leaders. Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi,
[42:48.240 --> 42:54.720]  old, drunken fools that are leading this country down a dark, dark path for their
[42:54.720 --> 43:20.720]  own selfish desires. It's really sad. It's really pathetic, really dangerous.

[47:08.480 --> 47:23.360]  I really got to say, I'm just at a loss at how deranged and insane our leaders are. I mean,
[47:23.360 --> 47:29.200]  you take one look at Nancy Pelosi. You took one look at Joe Biden. It's just we are really at a
[47:29.200 --> 47:34.400]  dark point in this country's history when those two have any power at all, have any influence at
[47:34.400 --> 47:41.120]  all. But we got to move on. And I want to get into the primary results from last night, just some
[47:41.120 --> 47:50.240]  of the highlights. Kerry Lake wins in Arizona. She makes a from behind comeback. It was kind of an
[47:50.240 --> 47:53.760]  odd thing actually when I went to bed last night, probably just after midnight, she was behind. I
[47:53.760 --> 47:59.040]  thought it was over. Kind of has the old Biden phenomenon happened for her actually, not as
[47:59.040 --> 48:06.320]  egregious or obvious, but when you wake up and the results have changed. You then have the Trump
[48:06.320 --> 48:13.040]  impeachment Republican Peter Meyer loses to John Gibbs. So I think it's going to be good. I think
[48:13.040 --> 48:18.000]  John Gibbs is going to be a good one to get in there. You had a Trump endorse Eric in Missouri.
[48:18.000 --> 48:22.240]  People weren't sure it was that Eric Schmidt or Eric Greitens. So either way, Trump wins, whether
[48:22.240 --> 48:28.320]  it was Greitens or Schmidt, Schmidt won. And I think I really don't like the way the Republican
[48:28.320 --> 48:32.240]  party did Eric Greitens. I got to be honest, I think they did him kind of dirty. We'll talk about
[48:32.240 --> 48:38.640]  that as well. And then the Democrats do not want to commit to Biden in 2024. That's very telling.
[48:38.640 --> 48:44.080]  That's because everybody knows he's a disaster. But Bob, let's start in Arizona. Now we both agree,
[48:44.080 --> 48:46.880]  we didn't even talk about this before the show, but it's pretty obvious to anybody that follows
[48:46.880 --> 48:52.480]  politics that the governor race in Arizona was the most important race when it comes to measuring
[48:52.480 --> 48:56.720]  where we might stand in the 2024 presidential elections. But I think there's a little carry
[48:56.720 --> 49:03.920]  over there from 2020 because I want to look at these numbers. Republican turnout last night
[49:03.920 --> 49:10.800]  in Arizona for the governor race was 636,593. That's how many people voted for Republican.
[49:11.600 --> 49:20.320]  On the Democrat side, you only had 482,024 voting. So that's a massive difference. That's not a small
[49:20.320 --> 49:27.680]  margin. That is a huge margin. Now, Biden won Arizona allegedly by 10,000 votes. By 10,000 votes
[49:27.680 --> 49:34.000]  is what they say Biden won Arizona with in the presidential election. Now here you are, not even
[49:34.000 --> 49:39.600]  two years later, and Republicans have a massive margin. I mean, what is this? Like a 20% plus
[49:39.600 --> 49:45.440]  margin over Democrats in the governor's race? To me, that shows more evidence that the results
[49:45.440 --> 49:51.760]  of 2020 were inaccurate. But leading into 2024, you got to like that if you're a Republican. You
[49:51.760 --> 49:57.920]  got to like clearly having, and it's a distinctive advantage as far as the turnout last night was
[49:57.920 --> 50:02.080]  concerned. Yeah, there were several things to watch. One was to watch whether or not Kerry Lake won
[50:02.080 --> 50:06.240]  in Arizona. The early numbers suggested she was going to lose, which was a shock to pretty much
[50:06.240 --> 50:11.360]  everybody because all of the data suggested she should win by double digits. And the fact that
[50:11.360 --> 50:16.080]  it was close. Now it may turn out to not even end up being that close by the end. Her lead keeps
[50:16.080 --> 50:20.480]  expanding and expanding and expanding. So we'll see what it ultimately ends up being because
[50:20.480 --> 50:25.520]  that was like Trump in 2020. And then early on, the reason why Fox called Arizona prematurely
[50:25.520 --> 50:30.000]  is because Biden, the Biden votes were the ones that for whatever reason got counted first.
[50:30.000 --> 50:34.000]  And then Trump's votes started to come in and come in. Same thing happened with Kerry Lake, but
[50:34.000 --> 50:40.400]  it's big because you need a governor in Arizona in 2024 who cares about election integrity.
[50:40.400 --> 50:45.520]  We didn't have that in 2020, not in Arizona, not in Georgia, not in Wisconsin, not in Michigan,
[50:45.520 --> 50:51.520]  not in Pennsylvania. Arizona is now going to be the first state to flip through someone who cares
[50:51.520 --> 50:56.960]  a lot about election integrity in Kerry Lake. So Kerry Lake is a very big win in Arizona. Same
[50:56.960 --> 51:02.160]  with Blake Masters, big win in Arizona. Blake Masters is a populist candidate backed sort of
[51:02.160 --> 51:09.520]  along the JD Vance model. Blake Masters has been more anti-war than others, more populist on trade,
[51:09.520 --> 51:14.240]  populist on immigration, populist on issues of culture, very pro-Trump, wants to have meaningful
[51:14.240 --> 51:19.440]  election reform in his state as well as across the country. That was very good news. Another
[51:19.440 --> 51:26.160]  Trump-endorsed candidate, John Gibbs, took out Peter Meyer, the pro-impeachment Republican,
[51:26.160 --> 51:30.720]  woke-oriented Republican there in the Western District of Michigan. It there, too, looked
[51:30.720 --> 51:35.280]  like Meyer was going to hold on early, but then the votes really came in and Gibbs was able to top
[51:35.280 --> 51:41.360]  it out and prevail. In Missouri, and Eric won, this time Eric Schmidt instead of Eric Greitens.
[51:41.360 --> 51:45.360]  Eric Schmidt has done a lot of great work as Attorney General. That's why Trump split kind
[51:45.360 --> 51:53.520]  of his endorsement between him and Greitens and just said, I support Eric. But the reason he didn't
[51:53.520 --> 51:59.120]  fully endorse Schmidt is because originally he was inclined towards Greitens, and the
[51:59.120 --> 52:04.720]  Greitens got hammered, as you note, by a very dirty, sleazy campaign waged in Missouri by
[52:04.720 --> 52:09.600]  Carl Rove and others that defamed him and improp-made improp-is the second time he's
[52:09.600 --> 52:14.160]  been a victim of a defamation and legal hit. And that's why I kind of wanted to focus on that.
[52:14.160 --> 52:20.240]  And to me, there's hope in the Republican Party because real people can get in there and change
[52:20.240 --> 52:24.640]  it up. I do believe that. We can get rid of the Rhinos. We can get rid of the Deep Staters. We can
[52:24.640 --> 52:31.760]  get rid of the Woke Commies and Democrats pretending to be Republicans. But Greitens
[52:31.760 --> 52:36.880]  first got set up by the FBI. The FBI ran a sting operation and set him up. That all came out. He
[52:36.880 --> 52:42.240]  lost his position as governor because of it. And Schmidt was a great Attorney General, so, you know,
[52:42.240 --> 52:48.800]  he threw his hat in the ring. But it's like, here's why the Republican Party can't or won't save the
[52:48.800 --> 52:54.080]  country right now. You had Eric Schmidt and Eric Greitens in the same race. Those are two heavy
[52:54.080 --> 52:58.080]  hitters that should have been spread out. But for whatever reason, the Republicans wanted to
[52:58.080 --> 53:04.000]  destroy Greitens, so they went after him, a Deep State attack. And then you had a third candidate
[53:04.000 --> 53:08.160]  in there who I thought was good too, Mark McCloskey. They probably should have inserted him into a
[53:08.160 --> 53:14.080]  house race somewhere. Would have been better off. But he falls off the table behind the two Erics.
[53:15.040 --> 53:21.600]  Now Schmidt's going to run against one of the Bush, BUSCH family, one of the Beers.
[53:21.600 --> 53:25.280]  Anheisers. Yeah, one of the Anheisers. Now, you're from Missouri, so...
[53:25.280 --> 53:28.080]  Yes, I'm very familiar with all of this. Very familiar.
[53:28.080 --> 53:34.720]  Yeah, so the... Do you think... I mean, I think the so-called political experts, the 538s and
[53:34.720 --> 53:39.040]  8 Selvers, et cetera, think she has a chance. I don't think she has any chance. What do you think
[53:39.040 --> 53:44.560]  happens in an Eric Schmidt general election against this person who's got ceaseless money from the
[53:44.560 --> 53:51.440]  old beer Anheiser family name? Obviously, the name recognition helps, but I don't think it helps
[53:51.440 --> 53:56.400]  enough. I think Schmidt is going to probably win this Senate seat pretty easily. I don't think
[53:56.400 --> 54:04.720]  it'll be too close. And you know, the Bushes, when they sold Inbev, actually a lot of people's
[54:05.600 --> 54:09.440]  taste soured to them when they sold out to Inbev. A lot of local people. Now, obviously,
[54:09.440 --> 54:12.720]  the Bush family's done a lot for Missouri. I'm not saying that. And there's a lot of great people.
[54:12.720 --> 54:18.160]  I've been friends with a lot of them over. Very generous group of people, but still a red state.
[54:18.160 --> 54:24.720]  And I think that Schmidt has enough going for him after being the attorney general that he
[54:24.720 --> 54:29.520]  should win this thing pretty easily. I think the most disappointing result was in Kansas,
[54:29.520 --> 54:34.400]  where it appears the late media campaign, over a million dollars in late media ads,
[54:34.400 --> 54:38.720]  to convince people that the amendment they were voting on, which was just an amendment to
[54:38.720 --> 54:45.440]  authorize the state legislature to limit abortion, actually was a complete and total ban on abortion.
[54:45.440 --> 54:52.320]  And even the polls showed the yes vote leading just a week ago, the late million dollar money
[54:52.320 --> 54:57.120]  bombardment by Planned Parenthood and the rest. But isn't it amazing how the propaganda works?
[54:57.120 --> 55:02.080]  Yeah, it's a testament. Why do they want to take out Alex Jones at InfoWars? It's because look at
[55:02.080 --> 55:06.800]  what happened on the Kansas abortion bill, where people didn't even bother to read the actual language.
[55:06.800 --> 55:10.400]  They don't even understand the issue. And then thinking they're voting on a complete
[55:10.400 --> 55:14.960]  ban on abortion when they're just voting on the power of their state legislature to decide
[55:14.960 --> 55:21.200]  the issue of abortion. By the way, they did another redefining moment. Was it last night or was it
[55:22.000 --> 55:28.160]  Monday night, where they have, you know, the end topic pregnancies, right, where the baby's
[55:28.160 --> 55:33.920]  in the fallopian tube. That's not even considered a viable pregnancy. That's not even considered
[55:33.920 --> 55:38.720]  an abortion. That's considered a different medical procedure. So it doesn't even come into abortion.
[55:38.720 --> 55:43.280]  That's not even when totally separate issue. They've now rewritten, I don't even know the
[55:43.280 --> 55:47.200]  key words to search guys, if you're looking on the internet, I was reading it last night.
[55:47.200 --> 55:53.200]  They've now rewritten the definition of end topic pregnancy to trick people into thinking
[55:53.200 --> 55:57.600]  that those are going to be banned with these abortion bans. I mean, they're rewriting definitions.
[55:57.600 --> 56:03.840]  They're re, I mean, we're in 1984. Oh, no doubt. I mean, because doctors often use the language
[56:03.840 --> 56:10.160]  abortion to describe miscarriages as spontaneous abortions, they're confusing ordinary people
[56:10.160 --> 56:14.480]  into thinking these new bans on abortion are like what you've heard a doctor say.
[56:14.480 --> 56:19.040]  So anyone who's experienced a miscarriage is misled to believe that suddenly they will be
[56:19.040 --> 56:24.080]  called a criminal because of what that is not at all the case. That has never been the law.
[56:24.080 --> 56:28.240]  The law has always been clear that that is in what's covered. What's covered is the direct
[56:28.240 --> 56:33.920]  deliberate killing of an unborn child. But what the Kansas learning lessons should be because of
[56:33.920 --> 56:39.280]  the media bias, because the big money's on the other on the pro abortion side, they need to create
[56:39.280 --> 56:45.760]  indisputable laws that can't that anybody can look at and understand go for the popular majority.
[56:45.760 --> 56:51.360]  And the popular majority position is the heartbeat position. Once an unborn life has a heartbeat,
[56:51.360 --> 56:56.960]  you can't abort it unless there's an emergency of the life of danger to the mother, which is,
[56:56.960 --> 57:01.760]  which is the law in most of Europe. Yes. But yeah, they keep lying about that. Now,
[57:01.760 --> 57:06.640]  Democrats will not get behind Joe Biden in 2024, despite him saying he was running.
[57:06.640 --> 57:10.480]  Why would that be? Well, because he's terribly unpopular. The problem we have is Richard
[57:10.480 --> 57:15.280]  Barris is no not Biden. Biden is still the most popular Democrat amongst other Democrats.
[57:15.280 --> 57:19.280]  That's the problem they have. They wanted to replace him. I mean, Hunter Biden is so likeable.
[57:19.280 --> 57:23.760]  Well, my view is the guy to watch for who's the deep state favorite. It's Pete Booty Booty.
[57:24.720 --> 57:30.640]  He's their favorite candidate at edge. Yeah. Booty judge. Yeah, exactly. To see if he can.
[57:30.640 --> 57:36.320]  There's a lot of jokes about him coming. But the but they will try to replace Kamala Harris with him
[57:36.320 --> 57:40.720]  if the deep state has their way. They probably would like to see a boot and edge booty judge
[57:40.720 --> 57:45.200]  Harris ticket, maybe even yes, because they can't completely throw a Harris under the bus.
[57:45.200 --> 58:06.640]  So I believe they'd like to. I don't think they'd like her to be around either.
[58:32.640 --> 58:39.920]  For so much more right now, whatever you do, pray for justice and pray for freedom and pray for
[58:39.920 --> 58:45.280]  the children and pray for free speech and justice to win. Thank you so much for joining us. I'll
[58:45.280 --> 58:49.920]  spread the word, my friends, we're involved in an epic historic battle. If you're like myself and
[58:49.920 --> 58:54.160]  so many other people on this planet, especially as you get older, you gain weight, even if you eat
[58:54.160 --> 58:59.760]  a lot less. I got to tell you, info wars is only about bringing you amazing products that really
[58:59.760 --> 59:04.320]  work. So we looked at the supplement market that we find a lot of our operations with. And we said,
[59:04.320 --> 59:10.480]  what are the best selling natural, healthy, anti fat weight loss products that are out there?
[59:10.480 --> 59:16.000]  We went and looked at the top 10. They all have the same ingredients in common that is in this

[1:00:10.320 --> 1:00:19.760]  Vin Scully passed yesterday. And anybody who grew up listening to baseball knows the voice of Vin Scully,
[1:00:20.400 --> 1:00:23.200]  truly one of the all time greats. They don't make them like Vin anymore.
[1:00:24.640 --> 1:00:30.480]  And one of the great Vin Scully moments we have captured for you now, Vin Scully was a great American.
[1:00:30.480 --> 1:00:34.960]  And you'll know that after hearing this classic Vin Scully clip on clip eight.
[1:00:34.960 --> 1:00:42.560]  Socialism failing to work as it always does in Venezuela. You talk about giving everybody
[1:00:42.560 --> 1:00:47.360]  something free and all of a sudden there's no food to eat. And who do you think is the richest
[1:00:47.360 --> 1:00:56.640]  person in Venezuela, the daughter of Hugo Chavez? Hello. Anyway, oh, and to Vin Scully,
[1:00:57.200 --> 1:01:03.200]  classic all time classic. I mean, he's even better than the the famous one for the the Chicago Cups,
[1:01:03.200 --> 1:01:08.640]  the who I'm blanking. I can see Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, I met Harry,
[1:01:08.640 --> 1:01:13.120]  Harry, many years ago in Chicago. Oh, he was a character. Oh, absolutely. But he was more of a
[1:01:13.120 --> 1:01:19.360]  character, whereas Vin Scully was an old school, great professional, absolutely, who wasn't afraid
[1:01:19.360 --> 1:01:25.120]  to say his mind. He couldn't say that today. No, no, no, no, no, no, that. And why is he
[1:01:25.120 --> 1:01:28.560]  commenting on that? Because of how many Venezuelan people were escaping Venezuela, including
[1:01:28.560 --> 1:01:32.960]  several that became famous players, including famous players for the Los Angeles Dodgers.
[1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:40.400]  Yeah. And there were a couple of players who recently, when the latest foods, you know, starving
[1:01:40.400 --> 1:01:44.720]  people, riots broke out in Venezuela, a couple players from Venezuela made statements about
[1:01:44.720 --> 1:01:48.400]  how grateful they are to be Americans now and how grateful they are to live in a free country.
[1:01:49.440 --> 1:01:52.640]  Media didn't really like to cover that. They don't really like to give that any attention.
[1:01:53.360 --> 1:01:58.560]  But you know, it's amazing. You're not going to really get any broadcasters like Vin Scully
[1:01:58.560 --> 1:02:03.200]  anymore, I'm afraid. You're not going to get the Harry Carries. You're not going to get the Jack Bucks
[1:02:03.200 --> 1:02:10.720]  because all these broadcasters are trained to not say what they see or not say what they feel
[1:02:10.720 --> 1:02:15.520]  and just say what's politically correct. And that everything else follows that. Everything else
[1:02:15.520 --> 1:02:20.800]  in the training to be a broadcaster now flows through the political correct lens or the
[1:02:20.800 --> 1:02:23.840]  political correct voice box. So you're just not going to have grades anymore.
[1:02:23.840 --> 1:02:27.920]  Not at all. In fact, I mean, ESPN has purged anybody who's not woke from being there.
[1:02:27.920 --> 1:02:33.040]  And excuse me, but when I tune into a ballgame and I hear a woman and a broadcaster click,
[1:02:33.040 --> 1:02:38.320]  I'm out. Exactly. Well, especially they get the worst voices. They're horrible. Why not get
[1:02:38.320 --> 1:02:42.560]  there's plenty of women announcers that have good voices that you could sit there and listen to.
[1:02:42.560 --> 1:02:45.520]  And that are good at their job. Exactly. They could sell the sport. Well,
[1:02:45.520 --> 1:02:50.080]  I mean, like the reporter who finally had to leave ESPN because of all the problems,
[1:02:50.080 --> 1:02:53.600]  the sideline reporters there for like 20 years, but get her name. I'm blanking on it.
[1:02:53.600 --> 1:02:58.080]  There's Sage Steele. There were Sage Steele. There was Michelle Tafoya. Michelle Tafoya.
[1:02:58.080 --> 1:03:01.920]  Yeah. Yeah. Remember how many? I mean, she was a good sideline reporter. She was great.
[1:03:01.920 --> 1:03:06.000]  Siley got the information, got the intel, couldn't stand being there because of how politicized
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:10.240]  it had become. And that is true throughout all of it. You can't just tune in and enjoy the game.
[1:03:10.240 --> 1:03:13.680]  There's going to be some politics somewhere in the game. There's going to be some politics
[1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:17.520]  by the end now. I mean, look at Kirk Schilling. He should be in the Hall of Fame. I mean,
[1:03:17.520 --> 1:03:22.320]  this is a guy who came out with the bloody sock. I think that was fake. I don't know.
[1:03:22.320 --> 1:03:27.760]  I'm a Cardinal fan. I'm a Red Sox fan. Oh, I was. I grew up as a Red Sox fan. My family did.
[1:03:27.760 --> 1:03:31.840]  So that was one of the, that was the greatest series of all time from a Red Sox fan perspective.
[1:03:31.840 --> 1:03:35.600]  Here's one of the all time great pictures. I mean, this guy intimidated the New York Yankees.
[1:03:35.600 --> 1:03:41.440]  Two World Series. Two World Series with Arizona and with Red Sox. And yet he can't get into
[1:03:41.440 --> 1:03:44.400]  the Hall of Fame. Why? Because his politics doesn't fit. Because he's a conservative.
[1:03:44.400 --> 1:03:48.400]  Yeah. He appears on Breitbart. Can't afford that. And so that's, I mean, it's become,
[1:03:48.400 --> 1:03:52.400]  and even though ESPN continues to suffer from it, NBA continues to suffer from it.
[1:03:52.400 --> 1:03:58.480]  We were talking with Ryan Kinnell. He pointed out, I mean, there's been a 75% decline in the NBA
[1:03:58.480 --> 1:04:03.200]  ratings and the finals over the, since Michael Jordan's departure. I won't even watch the NBA.
[1:04:03.200 --> 1:04:07.680]  And that's despite the population going up, not down. So that means that they don't care because
[1:04:07.680 --> 1:04:12.800]  they're on in China. Exactly. The, even though China, they'll never satiate and satisfy China.
[1:04:12.800 --> 1:04:16.880]  China finds the Wolkster stuff to be ridiculous. Yeah. Well, they don't allow gay stuff.
[1:04:16.880 --> 1:04:20.000]  No, I mean, they don't allow, they don't. I don't think they really like black people either.
[1:04:20.960 --> 1:04:23.600]  There's a long. Not in China. Unless they're playing basketball.
[1:04:23.600 --> 1:04:27.280]  Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So I mean, I mean, their history of racism, their history of
[1:04:27.280 --> 1:04:31.360]  chauvinism, their history. I mean, disproportionately, girl babies were killed during the World
[1:04:31.360 --> 1:04:35.760]  Dial there. All of that. This is not a society to model anything after. And yet.
[1:04:35.760 --> 1:04:39.680]  What was the NBA chosen model? What was the name? There was, I think it was a Reds broadcast. I think
[1:04:39.680 --> 1:04:44.240]  it was Tom Breneman. They came in early. Do you remember that? They came in early from a break
[1:04:44.240 --> 1:04:48.560]  and he said something about how the city had gone like to crap or something. He's like,
[1:04:48.560 --> 1:04:54.000]  this city is a hell hole now. And they came to Hot Mike. He's like, uh, sorry about that.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:05:15.440]  They fired him. It's true. The cities are hell holes.
[1:05:24.720 --> 1:05:28.400]  Spread the word about the show, share the article, share the videos, and please

[1:05:56.400 --> 1:05:57.200]  historic battle.
[1:06:06.560 --> 1:06:16.240]  Live from the infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show. And now your host, Owen
[1:06:16.240 --> 1:06:23.520]  Troyer. And we're back here. Our number two of the Alex Jones show, Owen Troyer, Bob Barnes
[1:06:23.520 --> 1:06:29.280]  with you. We're going to play a clip here that I find hilarious Republicans complaining about
[1:06:29.280 --> 1:06:35.280]  Donald Trump and how he uses the money that they fundraise off of his name. That's the
[1:06:35.280 --> 1:06:39.680]  ironic part about it. The Republican party, man. It's, uh, we really need some new leadership
[1:06:39.680 --> 1:06:44.640]  in it desperately if we're going to save this country. Before we do that though, ladies and
[1:06:44.640 --> 1:06:51.120]  gentlemen, vitamin mineral fusion has been a top rated top seller at infowarstore.com
[1:06:51.120 --> 1:06:56.880]  since we came out with it years ago. In fact, it's so popular. We have trouble keeping it in
[1:06:56.880 --> 1:07:01.200]  stock. And so if you've been going to infowar store the last couple of months looking for
[1:07:01.200 --> 1:07:05.200]  vitamin mineral fusion, you've seen that it's sold out. You've had to join the waiting list.
[1:07:05.200 --> 1:07:10.320]  Well, it's back in stock. It's a limited supply, but we still have plenty of it in stock. And
[1:07:10.320 --> 1:07:15.840]  right now it is 40% off at infowarstore.com. It's got, I like the way Bob Barnes put it the other
[1:07:15.840 --> 1:07:20.000]  day. It's got the alphabet of vitamins in here. It really does get the whole alphabet of vitamins
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:27.280]  in here. And with most of them, it is over the 100% daily value needed. Not to mention so much
[1:07:27.280 --> 1:07:32.240]  more in here that you're just not going to get anywhere else like the L glutamine, the glycine,
[1:07:32.880 --> 1:07:40.080]  the NAC, the coenzyme Q10, the zinc, the magnesium. I'm just reading off the label here right off
[1:07:40.080 --> 1:07:44.720]  of the canister. Vitamin mineral fusion, infowarstore.com. I start every day with vitamin
[1:07:44.720 --> 1:07:49.920]  mineral fusion. I like mixing it with juice. I chase down my supplements. I would mix a picture.

[1:07:54.000 --> 1:08:00.320]  be drinking vitamin mineral fusion. Take the sodas out. Take the toxic energy drinks out.

[1:08:08.880 --> 1:08:14.080]  and they won't be getting the unhealthy drinks that so many others have in their fridge.
[1:08:14.080 --> 1:08:18.640]  And you'll be supporting free speech and supporting info wars to keep us on the air when you shop
[1:08:18.640 --> 1:08:24.880]  at infowarstore.com. It's vitamin mineral fusion exclusively available, 40% off right now
[1:08:24.880 --> 1:08:30.640]  at infowarstore.com. All right. I want to play this clip real quick, Bob, because I find this so
[1:08:30.640 --> 1:08:36.080]  funny. I don't like having to sign up for all the notifications, but I do. I get all the Democrat
[1:08:36.080 --> 1:08:40.560]  notifications. I get all the Republican notifications. They both annoy me just as much, to be honest.
[1:08:41.280 --> 1:08:48.480]  But I find this hilarious. Now, I probably get 10 emails a day from directly from the GOP or
[1:08:48.480 --> 1:08:54.000]  Republican, this Republican, that everybody uses Trump's name, his image, his name, this. I'm sure
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:59.840]  you see it too, right? They all have Trump. Yes. So now the Republican party has a problem
[1:09:00.720 --> 1:09:05.760]  with the way Trump is using some of these funds. Here's Jonathan Carl explaining that
[1:09:05.760 --> 1:09:12.880]  situation, how the RNC is fighting Donald Trump right now. I've been paying Donald Trump's personal
[1:09:12.880 --> 1:09:20.000]  legal bills. Some of these related to his businesses in New York, $1.7 million more than that,
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:25.680]  just since October. Most recent payment we know of, more than $50,000 last month.
[1:09:25.680 --> 1:09:29.760]  So now they're making this threat and Republicans really don't want Donald Trump announcing
[1:09:29.760 --> 1:09:32.960]  that he's running for president as they had in the midterms where they think they're going to do well.
[1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:38.400]  Yeah, this is really something, a threat from the RNC quietly said, we found out about it,
[1:09:38.400 --> 1:09:43.520]  that they will stop paying his legal bills when he or if he announces he's running for president.
[1:09:43.520 --> 1:09:48.720]  The big backdrop here is they don't want him to run, announce he's running before the midterms.
[1:09:48.720 --> 1:09:54.000]  They want to run midterm campaigns based on Joe Biden and the economy. If Donald Trump announces
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  he's running this fall, it messes with that strategy. So they're saying you do that, we'll
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:01.200]  stop paying your bills. All right, so forget about George Step on all of us and Jonathan
[1:10:01.200 --> 1:10:06.480]  Carl's political takes there. It's about as valuable as a poopy diaper. The story here that's so
[1:10:06.480 --> 1:10:12.240]  funny, every email I get from the Republican Party features Trump. Trump this, Trump that,
[1:10:12.240 --> 1:10:17.440]  his picture, his, you know, everything, Trump, Trump, Trump. They've been fundraising off of
[1:10:17.440 --> 1:10:23.920]  Trump's back since the last presidential election. Now guys, see if you can pull up how much money
[1:10:23.920 --> 1:10:28.080]  the Republican Party or the GOP has raised since the presidential election. I mean,
[1:10:28.080 --> 1:10:32.320]  it's got to be all, it's got to be like hundreds of millions of dollars off of Trump's name.
[1:10:32.320 --> 1:10:36.400]  Now, do you recall when they were first doing this, Trump gave them a cease and desist,
[1:10:36.400 --> 1:10:41.200]  and he said, stop using my name to fund raise. They said, basically F, you were going to do it
[1:10:41.200 --> 1:10:46.560]  anyway. So he said, okay, fine. Well, then I want some of those funds. 1.7 million of probably 250
[1:10:46.560 --> 1:10:50.960]  million that they've raised, 1.7 is a lot of money, but it's small drop in the bucket.
[1:10:50.960 --> 1:10:55.840]  Well, the backstory on this is the Republican National Committee raised a quarter of a billion
[1:10:55.840 --> 1:11:01.920]  dollars, 250 million right after the election to support, they said, election challenges and
[1:11:01.920 --> 1:11:07.920]  contests. To my knowledge, none of that money went to the lawyers bringing election challenges
[1:11:07.920 --> 1:11:12.480]  and content. And by the way, not to play Trump's defender here because he doesn't need it. He can
[1:11:12.480 --> 1:11:17.360]  defend himself, but I see the, I see a lot of commentary saying, what did Trump do with the
[1:11:17.360 --> 1:11:21.840]  money? What did Trump do with the money? It was never Trump's money. The Republicans were
[1:11:21.840 --> 1:11:26.240]  basically putting on a Trump mask saying, give me money. I'm Trump and then just stuffing their
[1:11:26.240 --> 1:11:31.920]  pockets. And I know this firsthand because Trump and people around Trump had recommended me to run
[1:11:31.920 --> 1:11:37.600]  the election contest and the election challenges in November of 2020. Talk to Mark Meadows, then
[1:11:37.600 --> 1:11:41.760]  chief of staff at the White House, talk to a range of other people who are in the decision-making
[1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:47.120]  process, including the president himself. And then, but Ronald McDaniel controlled it because
[1:11:47.120 --> 1:11:52.080]  all the money was at the RNC. So the only people who could make the final authorization for who
[1:11:52.080 --> 1:11:57.360]  would do election contest and challenges were at the RNC. And she chose not to hire any of the
[1:11:57.360 --> 1:12:01.360]  people associated with our team. And of course, we know what happened to the election contest.
[1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:05.840]  They all didn't go anywhere. And it's because of who they chose because they wanted to hijack that
[1:12:05.840 --> 1:12:11.280]  money and spend it on other things unrelated to the election contest. A lot of people who donated
[1:12:11.280 --> 1:12:17.200]  got agitated. And you're right. Since then, my guess is they have raised collectively off of Trump
[1:12:17.200 --> 1:12:22.400]  since he's been elected over a billion dollars. Well, that's why I went with the 200 or so million
[1:12:22.400 --> 1:12:26.240]  because that was the last number I saw. That was just the, but that was probably like a year and
[1:12:26.240 --> 1:12:29.280]  a half ago now. That was just right after the election. I mean, they've raised hundreds of
[1:12:29.280 --> 1:12:32.480]  millions more and it doesn't count all the money they raised while he was president. And it's
[1:12:32.480 --> 1:12:37.600]  important to note all of these legal cases stem from him being president in the Republican nominee.
[1:12:37.600 --> 1:12:42.880]  So the Republican National Committee should be the ones paying all the legal bills for all of this.
[1:12:42.880 --> 1:12:47.840]  And they never backed him in the public square. Not only that, the other aspect with this is
[1:12:47.840 --> 1:12:53.520]  they probably want to because as long as the RNC is writing the checks, the RNC controls who Trump's
[1:12:53.520 --> 1:12:58.880]  lawyers are. The moment those lawyers don't have to depend on Trump, Trump maybe hires his own
[1:12:58.880 --> 1:13:04.160]  lawyers. His own lawyers might take a much more aggressive approach, both in the court of law
[1:13:04.160 --> 1:13:09.120]  and in the court of public opinion. And the RNC doesn't want that to happen at all. So it's a
[1:13:09.120 --> 1:13:12.800]  bluff. They're faking, hey, Trump, we're going to stick you with a bunch of million dollar legal
[1:13:12.800 --> 1:13:18.240]  bills unless you keep your mouth shut until after November because we think it would net help us
[1:13:18.240 --> 1:13:23.440]  when in fact what would net help us is if actually Trump did declare the ordinary Republican. But
[1:13:23.440 --> 1:13:28.800]  this is also a bigger part of a scam that's happening. Kevin McCarthy is trying to suppress
[1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:35.120]  the number of good Republicans who win. He wants a majority, but not a big majority because the
[1:13:35.120 --> 1:13:40.080]  more not in America first majority. Exactly. He wants as few America first populist in the house
[1:13:40.080 --> 1:13:45.360]  as possible. And he knows as long as it's a slim majority, he has enough institutional
[1:13:45.360 --> 1:13:52.160]  establishment votes that keep him and his agenda in power. The moment that we get to 2030, 40,
[1:13:52.160 --> 1:13:58.160]  50 plus Republicans in the house is the moment Kevin McCarthy, Paul Ryan, they even though Paul
[1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:03.680]  Ryan's no longer in the Congress, he is over at the board of Fox News. He is on a bunch of think
[1:14:03.680 --> 1:14:08.320]  tanks. He is an old buddy of Kevin McCarthy. They're still running their anti-Trump agenda.
[1:14:08.320 --> 1:14:13.040]  They lose their anti-Trump agenda. So the real reason the Republican National Committee doesn't
[1:14:13.040 --> 1:14:18.080]  want Trump to go out and endorse and declare his race and say he's running is as you note,
[1:14:18.080 --> 1:14:21.280]  can't be because of the base because they use Trump to raise all their money.
[1:14:21.280 --> 1:14:25.200]  It also can't be because they think he's going to cost them votes. They know he's going to help
[1:14:25.200 --> 1:14:30.480]  them get votes. Most votes of all time. They're a Republican. Exactly. They don't want a bunch
[1:14:30.480 --> 1:14:36.800]  of Marjorie Taylor Greene's and Lauren Boeberts and Paul Gosar's and JD Vance's and Blake Masters
[1:14:36.800 --> 1:14:44.480]  and Kerry Lake's in office next year. Now, is that aside from the politics of it, is it an ego
[1:14:44.480 --> 1:14:49.840]  thing too where McCarthy realizes these people are much more important than me? I'm the Speaker
[1:14:49.840 --> 1:14:53.760]  of the House, but somehow they're outshining me. Well, completely. I mean, we have an old model
[1:14:53.760 --> 1:14:57.520]  that we shouldn't be following anymore. Used to be the Speaker of the House was there because
[1:14:57.520 --> 1:15:01.280]  he could raise the most money. Now, because of grassroots funding and what Donald Trump has
[1:15:01.280 --> 1:15:06.240]  shown, use Trump, you raise money, all of a sudden McCarthy is useless. So his power base is really
[1:15:06.240 --> 1:15:11.280]  gone and he's operating off of a deception that he has power that he no longer wields. And that's
[1:15:11.280 --> 1:15:16.320]  why he wants to keep a slim a majority as possible with his few MAGA candidates running as possible
[1:15:16.320 --> 1:15:20.960]  and winning as possible. So the real scam and scheme is keep Trump from getting involved in
[1:15:20.960 --> 1:15:25.520]  declaring his candidacy so that they limit the number of Republicans that went office not to
[1:15:25.520 --> 1:15:30.400]  improve the number of Republicans. Yeah. And I guess the other leverage that McCarthy might have is
[1:15:30.400 --> 1:15:35.840]  if you do have a slim margin in the House, his ability to wheel and deal becomes important.
[1:15:35.840 --> 1:15:41.360]  Whereas if you have a larger margin of America firsters, they're not going to go check on with
[1:15:41.360 --> 1:15:45.440]  Kevin McCarthy's approval for anything. He's basically going to become defunct as a Speaker
[1:15:45.440 --> 1:15:50.320]  of the House, which really I think the Speaker of the House needs on the Republican side needs
[1:15:50.320 --> 1:15:54.480]  to be someone who is willing to stick their neck out and make the court of public opinion the
[1:15:54.480 --> 1:16:00.880]  political battle. Info Wars has been vindicated. We've been proven right. World government,
[1:16:00.880 --> 1:16:07.120]  the New World Order is out of the open. And now more than ever, the forces of Satan are trying
[1:16:07.120 --> 1:16:12.400]  to shut down this broadcast. The forces of anti-human, godless New World Order are out of
[1:16:12.400 --> 1:16:17.920]  control. So now realize we have pushed them out of the light. We have pushed them out in the open

[1:19:53.920 --> 1:20:23.840]  it's worked great for me. All right, Bob Barnes and I talking all the latest
[1:20:23.840 --> 1:20:31.760]  news here. Glad to have you along for the ride as Alex Jones is again in court today. We may be
[1:20:31.760 --> 1:20:37.680]  hearing from him before the day is done. I will be hosting the war room by the way, but Alex may
[1:20:37.680 --> 1:20:42.320]  be coming in after he's finished on the stand for today. We'll be giving you the updates there.
[1:20:43.200 --> 1:20:46.960]  I want to get kind of back to the Trump thing that we were discussing in the last segment,
[1:20:46.960 --> 1:20:54.160]  Bob, and then we can start to move into some of the other news. Like for example,
[1:20:54.160 --> 1:20:57.520]  Andrew Yang, and I'm glad Yang is doing this. He's starting the third party. You've seen this,
[1:20:57.520 --> 1:21:00.960]  the fourth party. Thank God Yang is doing it because that's only going to take
[1:21:00.960 --> 1:21:05.680]  votes away from the Democrat party. That's kind of the way I see it. And so I don't think that
[1:21:05.680 --> 1:21:12.800]  really hurts Republicans, but what does hurt Republicans is weak leadership like Kevin McCarthy
[1:21:12.800 --> 1:21:18.720]  and Mitch McConnell. So let's say we start to get some of these America firsters,
[1:21:19.680 --> 1:21:23.520]  common sense, non-squish Republicans in there. I kind of view John Gibbs that way.
[1:21:23.520 --> 1:21:29.360]  Obviously Blake Masters. I think Joe Kent did not win last night. I think he took a...
[1:21:29.920 --> 1:21:31.360]  It's only half the votes are counted.
[1:21:31.360 --> 1:21:32.800]  Okay. So we're not sure about that.
[1:21:32.800 --> 1:21:35.040]  Washington, though. Their ballots come in slow.
[1:21:35.040 --> 1:21:40.960]  Okay. All right. Well, the point is though, if we get some more people like Marjorie Taylor-Green,
[1:21:40.960 --> 1:21:44.960]  Paul Gosar gets... He gets back on the ballot last night. He wins in his primary.
[1:21:46.080 --> 1:21:51.040]  What is the process of getting McCarthy out of Speaker House? What is the process of getting
[1:21:51.040 --> 1:21:58.720]  Mitch McConnell out of his leadership roles? What can Republican voters do, or the listeners of
[1:21:58.720 --> 1:22:05.600]  this show do, to try to spur that so we don't have a defunct, dead-duck Republican majority,
[1:22:05.600 --> 1:22:08.800]  hopefully, in Congress coming up after these midterms?
[1:22:08.800 --> 1:22:12.800]  I think it's a combination of continuing to support populist candidates and populist causes
[1:22:12.800 --> 1:22:17.920]  in the most informed and intelligent way. Let's look at it as an example. Joe Kent's race.
[1:22:17.920 --> 1:22:24.160]  So Joe Kent should have easily been in the top two. And the only reason he's right now in a close
[1:22:24.160 --> 1:22:28.960]  third, still a lot of votes yet to be counted, is because they ran a bunch of fake ads pretending
[1:22:28.960 --> 1:22:33.520]  another candidate was the Trump endorsed candidate in the race. Who was it? And it was solely meant
[1:22:33.520 --> 1:22:36.320]  to bring down Joe Kent's margin. And was that Republican ads?
[1:22:36.320 --> 1:22:41.840]  A Republican. But it was supposedly Republican. The reality is, or the person ran as a Republican.
[1:22:41.840 --> 1:22:44.240]  But the person running did not have Trump's endorsement.
[1:22:44.240 --> 1:22:47.040]  Was it one of the Democrat-funded Republicans that we saw?
[1:22:47.040 --> 1:22:51.120]  It was that. Plus, there was some other, we don't know fully the scale of where the money
[1:22:51.120 --> 1:22:54.080]  came from, but it appears some of it came from Karl Rove and other type groups.
[1:22:54.080 --> 1:22:55.120]  So Democrats.
[1:22:55.120 --> 1:22:56.400]  Exactly. Functionally.
[1:22:56.400 --> 1:22:57.120]  Third blossom.
[1:22:57.120 --> 1:23:00.640]  And that's what people need to continue to be more informed. And that was the only reason
[1:23:00.640 --> 1:23:04.960]  why the Kansas Abortion Amendment goes down. The only reason why Joe Kent didn't trouble at all.
[1:23:04.960 --> 1:23:08.000]  The only reason why it was even close with John Gibbs and Peter Meyer.
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:12.080]  The only reason why it was even close with Kerry Lake is because it's clear that the big money,
[1:23:12.080 --> 1:23:16.480]  big media influence, still has a lot of influence over even Republican primary voters.
[1:23:16.480 --> 1:23:20.560]  That's what happened in Georgia. In Georgia, they didn't know who Trump had endorsed.
[1:23:20.560 --> 1:23:23.280]  So they ended up voting for a bunch of candidates that Trump opposed.
[1:23:23.280 --> 1:23:27.200]  Because there had been such a swamp of media and money on one side of the aisle.
[1:23:27.200 --> 1:23:31.040]  So to counterbalance that, it's doing what the Info Wars model does.
[1:23:31.040 --> 1:23:34.880]  It's having independent information independently sourced by the audience.
[1:23:34.880 --> 1:23:40.400]  That's why when the audience goes to InfoWarsStore.com and buys products that make themselves healthier,
[1:23:40.400 --> 1:23:44.880]  wealthier and wiser in one clean, neat step, they're also making the world a better place.
[1:23:44.880 --> 1:23:50.080]  Because the key is having more Info Wars type information out there. More models that use
[1:23:50.080 --> 1:23:54.480]  Info Wars and replicate it as a template to create their own independent information in
[1:23:54.480 --> 1:23:58.720]  their own local jurisdiction in order to counterbalance the influence of big money and big
[1:23:58.720 --> 1:24:04.480]  media that we're witnessing create this continued Kevin McCarthy, Mitch McConnell type dominance
[1:24:04.480 --> 1:24:08.720]  of the Republican Party. It's a dominance that's breaking apart. I mean, in Arizona,
[1:24:08.720 --> 1:24:12.560]  Kerry Lake was able to break through, but was able to break through because enough ordinary
[1:24:12.560 --> 1:24:17.440]  everyday people got the message out. Was able to look past the big money campaign,
[1:24:17.440 --> 1:24:21.680]  look past the big media campaign, uncover and discover the truth and put a myth.
[1:24:21.680 --> 1:24:26.560]  Same with Blake Masters, same with JD Vance, same with John Gibbs. But they all faced uphill
[1:24:26.560 --> 1:24:31.120]  battles originally and initially because of the institutional opposition they faced.
[1:24:31.120 --> 1:24:36.400]  So we need to continue to poke holes in the dam that they are trying to control and gatekeep
[1:24:36.400 --> 1:24:41.280]  the information from getting out to the people because that's the most important aspect of
[1:24:41.280 --> 1:24:46.720]  getting a more informed, more self-educated electorate, creates a more self-empowered community
[1:24:46.720 --> 1:24:52.320]  and constituency that can in turn elect more mega populace to positions of power and influence
[1:24:52.320 --> 1:24:54.640]  to get the McCarthy's and McConnell's out of power.
[1:24:54.640 --> 1:24:59.360]  There's no reason why Joe Kent shouldn't have won that race last night easily. And I mean,
[1:24:59.360 --> 1:25:02.320]  the votes aren't all in, but it's not looking good, unfortunately.
[1:25:03.040 --> 1:25:09.120]  And the one lesson that I think future Republican candidates need to take away from this as well,
[1:25:09.120 --> 1:25:13.600]  you know, it's obviously harder to win a Senate race than a house race, but you look at Myra
[1:25:13.600 --> 1:25:18.000]  Flores, you know, she didn't really get much media endorsement or much media coverage at all
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:21.840]  until she won. Then all of a sudden everybody wanted her on TV, then all of a sudden you started
[1:25:21.840 --> 1:25:27.360]  seeing her here and everywhere. But before that, she really was kind of, you know, underground.
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:31.680]  I think the lesson to be learned here is, hey, you know what, it's great that Kerry Lake has
[1:25:31.680 --> 1:25:36.160]  a huge social media presence. It's great that Joe Kent has a big social media and media presence.
[1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:40.720]  I think that's a good thing. But you have to remember, you're running a local race. You
[1:25:40.720 --> 1:25:44.720]  can't forget about that. Most people that are going to see your content on Twitter or on Fox
[1:25:44.720 --> 1:25:49.040]  News aren't going to vote because they don't even live in your state. They don't even live in your
[1:25:49.040 --> 1:25:54.080]  congressional district. And so I think that the social media phenomenon and kind of the popularity
[1:25:54.080 --> 1:26:01.520]  contest that comes with this tends to overwhelm traditional techniques and techniques that we
[1:26:01.520 --> 1:26:06.400]  know work. You got to remember, you're running a local race. Most of people that see your stuff
[1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:10.240]  in media are not going to vote for you because they don't even live in the state or the district
[1:26:10.240 --> 1:26:14.400]  you're in. And I think that that might have been a case with Joe Kent. Now he did run a good ground
[1:26:14.400 --> 1:26:18.640]  game. I think his story is more of a Republican stabbing in the back and not getting behind
[1:26:18.640 --> 1:26:22.880]  him. But I think with Kari Lake, I mean, her race should not even have been close.
[1:26:22.880 --> 1:26:28.560]  Oh, no doubt. And I think it shows the big media, big money influence is still there. And we still
[1:26:28.560 --> 1:26:33.120]  have an uphill battle with that. But what the Info Wars model showed was particularly during the
[1:26:33.120 --> 1:26:38.960]  pandemic. How did you all of a sudden have these indigenous, organic, authentic grassroots
[1:26:38.960 --> 1:26:44.320]  rebellions all across the country showing up at protests at state capitals all across the nation
[1:26:44.320 --> 1:26:50.320]  that began and originated and instigated the protest against the lockdowns against the mask
[1:26:50.320 --> 1:26:55.360]  mandates against later on the vaccine mandates put all of that into motion. What that did was
[1:26:55.360 --> 1:27:01.120]  because it was the Info Wars model. It was people who are Info Wars fans who stayed connected to
[1:27:01.120 --> 1:27:06.400]  their local community, stayed organized in their local community so they could quickly get active
[1:27:06.400 --> 1:27:11.680]  in their local community. And we need to continue to duplicate and replicate that model all across
[1:27:11.680 --> 1:27:17.040]  the country in populist aligned constituencies and organizations in order to be able to maintain
[1:27:17.040 --> 1:27:21.440]  and sustain that. It's why the only reason why Info Wars is still here, not supposed to be here,
[1:27:21.440 --> 1:27:26.880]  is because of the audience keeping it afloat and alive by going to InfoWarsStore.com and getting
[1:27:26.880 --> 1:27:31.440]  products that they already need and want at a cheaper price than they can get at its nearest
[1:27:31.440 --> 1:27:36.640]  competitor for comparable quality. But we need to replicate that continually and consistently,
[1:27:36.640 --> 1:27:40.880]  create communities of common interest that continue to organize in the old American
[1:27:40.880 --> 1:27:46.320]  revolutionary style so that when Paul Revere comes writing through, enough people hear him so that
[1:27:46.320 --> 1:27:51.840]  they can take action to help change the world in the right way. And I also think, you know,
[1:27:51.840 --> 1:27:57.680]  they say politics is Hollywood for ugly people. I may have butchered the phrase, but it goes a
[1:27:57.680 --> 1:28:03.120]  little something like that. You know, what I see happening too is, look at the congressional baseball
[1:28:03.120 --> 1:28:08.080]  game, Democrats get beat 10 nothing, but it wasn't just the final score. I mean, they're losers,
[1:28:08.080 --> 1:28:14.160]  like they're awkward, they're ugly, they fumble around, they look like goblins and ghouls. Like,
[1:28:14.160 --> 1:28:19.280]  the Republicans need to embrace the optical battle here. Like when political debates first
[1:28:19.280 --> 1:28:24.880]  started airing on television, people understood, our candidate's got to look good. Like, he's got
[1:28:24.880 --> 1:28:30.800]  to look good. That's a major factor. I want to see it. I want to see, because you're already
[1:28:30.800 --> 1:28:34.640]  seeing, look at the Biden administration, look at the Democrat Party. It's a bunch of ugly people,
[1:28:34.640 --> 1:28:39.920]  it's a bunch of weird looking, old decrepit looking. The Republican Party needs to embrace
[1:28:40.560 --> 1:28:47.200]  a strong human man, a beautiful woman, and just start getting into the battle of optics again.
[1:28:47.200 --> 1:28:50.400]  I actually saw a lot of that last night. I think that that's kind of what's coming up in
[1:28:50.400 --> 1:28:54.720]  the Republican Party right now too, because really, it's also just shows good and evil.
[1:28:54.720 --> 1:28:56.480]  The universe has a weird way of showing you.
[1:28:57.520 --> 1:29:02.320]  Info wars has been vindicated. We've been proven right. World government, the new world order is
[1:29:02.320 --> 1:29:08.560]  out of the open. And now more than ever, the forces of Satan are trying to shut down this

[1:32:50.480 --> 1:33:02.720]  exclusively available at 1776point.com. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[1:33:02.720 --> 1:33:21.280]  it's Alex Jones. Broadcasting live from the UN stronghold, Austin, Texas. You're listening
[1:33:21.280 --> 1:33:31.440]  to the Alex Jones show, and now your host Owen Troyer. Boy oh boy, I really don't understand
[1:33:31.440 --> 1:33:37.600]  anybody that likes big government. That's a mystery to me. Who wants a bigger government? Who wants
[1:33:37.600 --> 1:33:43.600]  more government intervention in their lives? Anyway, Pentagon wipes January 6th text from
[1:33:43.600 --> 1:33:51.680]  phones belonging to top military generals court docs reveal. That's amazing because now remember
[1:33:51.680 --> 1:33:56.880]  the Democrats and the mainstream media were saying secret services covering something up,
[1:33:56.880 --> 1:34:02.480]  they deleted the texts. Now the I believe the official statement from Secret Service was just
[1:34:02.480 --> 1:34:08.880]  part of normal protocol to clear out these data from the phones. I don't know if that's true or
[1:34:08.880 --> 1:34:14.640]  not, but nonetheless they attacked Secret Service. They said it was an act of terrorism for Secret
[1:34:14.640 --> 1:34:18.240]  Service to do this. Do you think the mainstream media will be saying the same thing about the
[1:34:18.240 --> 1:34:22.480]  military deleting January 6th text? Do you think that'll be a story Bob? Well and the amazing thing
[1:34:22.480 --> 1:34:28.080]  about all this is it's clear that the timing of this wasn't to cover up things people did on behalf
[1:34:28.080 --> 1:34:35.840]  of Trump, but to cover up things they were doing against Trump. So then it's okay. Exactly. People
[1:34:35.840 --> 1:34:43.920]  should ask if the Secret Service really deleted the text that would embarrass Trump and that's why
[1:34:43.920 --> 1:34:50.080]  they deleted the text. Wouldn't the January 6th commission have run all over that and subpoenaed
[1:34:50.080 --> 1:34:53.520]  that right out of the game and they subpoenaed everybody else no demand. Speeded my mother.
[1:34:53.520 --> 1:34:58.240]  Exactly. My poor innocent mother you jerks. You're gonna pay, let me tell you, you're gonna pay in
[1:34:58.240 --> 1:35:03.200]  hell for doing that to my mom. Good luck. She's a saint. You come after me, that's fine, not my mom.
[1:35:03.200 --> 1:35:07.840]  That's who they are and yet they never subpoenaed until the very end when they knew the texts were
[1:35:07.840 --> 1:35:12.880]  gone, the Secret Service subpoenaed. Oh how convenient, yes. What it is, it's very simple.
[1:35:12.880 --> 1:35:17.920]  The anybody who studied it and looked at January 6th could recognize right away
[1:35:17.920 --> 1:35:22.720]  there were likely government informants, government infiltrators, government instigators,
[1:35:22.720 --> 1:35:28.160]  aspects of QAnon movement had that tattooed all over it, that this was an algorithm that was
[1:35:28.160 --> 1:35:33.120]  really designed likely by a government source to try to manipulate information and emotions,
[1:35:33.120 --> 1:35:36.720]  to try to manipulate narratives, to try to get people to do things that were against their
[1:35:36.720 --> 1:35:41.200]  self-interest or the interest of the cause that they were campaigning for and those all
[1:35:41.200 --> 1:35:45.440]  part and parcel of it. Why has the government still not disclosed who QAnon is? Why has the
[1:35:45.440 --> 1:35:49.440]  government not turned over QAnon discovery to the January 6th defendants? Probably for the same
[1:35:49.440 --> 1:35:53.040]  reason the Defense Department was busy doing pulling the Hillary Clinton and doing delete,
[1:35:53.040 --> 1:35:57.120]  delete, delete, delete, delete, delete because they have to because the Defense Department is
[1:35:57.120 --> 1:36:02.240]  involved, the aspects of the police were involved, the Capitol Police, just look at some of the
[1:36:02.240 --> 1:36:06.240]  so-called heroes of the Capitol Police. They were all Trump haters. They showed up, you know,
[1:36:06.240 --> 1:36:11.360]  having F Trump T-shirts with Kathy Lee Griffin who I'm busy suing for the Covington kids.
[1:36:11.360 --> 1:36:15.920]  But you know, they would, if it was the reverse situation, they would never call a witness up
[1:36:15.920 --> 1:36:19.520]  that voted for Trump. They'd say, that's bias. But oh, you are an F Trump shirt? That's not
[1:36:19.520 --> 1:36:24.160]  biased. You get to be called as a witness. Exactly. I mean, it's almost as much of a joke
[1:36:24.160 --> 1:36:29.600]  process as a certain trial that shall not be named and cannot be named as that's going on right now.
[1:36:29.600 --> 1:36:34.720]  So it's the same kind of process. Either they want to keep the exculpatory information out,
[1:36:34.720 --> 1:36:40.000]  they want to misinterpret and misportray and misperceive the information as inculpatory that
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:44.160]  really isn't. And it's all about government complicity and involvement with it. When I
[1:36:44.160 --> 1:36:49.520]  talked to Alex before January 6, worrying about the possibility of it being used as an event
[1:36:49.520 --> 1:36:54.160]  to undermine the Trump cause, to undermine the cause of election integrity that's independent
[1:36:54.160 --> 1:36:59.200]  of and separate from Trump, the, I thought there could be no concern because the Capitol is the
[1:36:59.200 --> 1:37:05.440]  most well guarded building in the world, especially on January 6. Yet magically, Capitol Police
[1:37:05.440 --> 1:37:09.840]  disappeared. Magically, there were no National Guard outside the Capitol. Magically, no other
[1:37:09.840 --> 1:37:14.720]  means of security, the seventh floor of the FBI accidentally misrelayed the wrong information
[1:37:14.720 --> 1:37:19.440]  to the Capitol Police. And by the way, we have the documents that Pelosi and Maryl Bowser both
[1:37:19.440 --> 1:37:24.480]  rejected Trump's request for 20,000 National Guard troops. They lied about that. And if I'm
[1:37:24.480 --> 1:37:29.680]  not mistaken, wasn't Pelosi caught deleting emails and text messages too? She deleted
[1:37:29.680 --> 1:37:34.240]  things. I mean, to date, we have not seen what it's so either she deleted them or destroyed
[1:37:34.240 --> 1:37:38.000]  them or either way has not produced them. But she's not been subpoenaed so she can erase evidence
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:41.840]  and that's okay. Exactly. That's what happened. Same with Mitch McConnell. I remember that night
[1:37:41.840 --> 1:37:46.480]  talking to people who are organizing, talking to people in Congress about the challenge because
[1:37:46.480 --> 1:37:51.680]  I was there to help organize and make presentations to members of Congress as needed about why
[1:37:51.680 --> 1:37:56.240]  constitutionally there is a right to challenge whether or not the election and the electors
[1:37:56.240 --> 1:38:00.880]  are constitutionally qualified electors from a constitutionally qualified election.
[1:38:00.880 --> 1:38:04.080]  And the, and that goes beyond, you don't have to prove fraud for that. You just have to prove
[1:38:04.080 --> 1:38:08.240]  that somebody voted that wasn't constitutionally qualified. Ballots were cast in a manner that
[1:38:08.240 --> 1:38:13.040]  were not constitutionally qualified or the ballots were counted in Canvas in a way that was not
[1:38:13.040 --> 1:38:17.200]  constitutionally qualified. And in the context of the presidency, that's what the state legislature
[1:38:17.200 --> 1:38:22.560]  sets, not anybody else. Yet everybody was at the same question. Everybody's like, why is McConnell
[1:38:22.560 --> 1:38:26.480]  not worried about this? It's like, I mean, he's going to lose a lot of votes once the real issues
[1:38:26.480 --> 1:38:31.440]  are in front of him. A lot of people don't want to go against Trump publicly. No, we kind of know
[1:38:31.440 --> 1:38:36.400]  why. We know Pelosi and McConnell weren't worried because they had inside information
[1:38:36.400 --> 1:38:40.880]  about what was supposed to happen that day. They wanted it to happen that day. And even
[1:38:40.880 --> 1:38:45.600]  though public opinion polling shows, the people who went in, even according to Harvard and other
[1:38:45.600 --> 1:38:50.320]  groups that did studies on it, said these people did not go in to obstruct the proceeding. They
[1:38:50.320 --> 1:38:56.240]  did not go in to insurrect anything. They didn't go in to cause a coup. It's just the opposite.
[1:38:56.240 --> 1:39:00.480]  They wanted to make sure Congress went through their constitutional duties and exercise their
[1:39:00.480 --> 1:39:05.120]  constitutional powers to make sure this election was a constitutionally conforming election.
[1:39:05.120 --> 1:39:09.040]  That's what they wanted to do in support of Trump. Not anything illicit or illegal,
[1:39:09.040 --> 1:39:13.200]  but they were able to mis-portray it and mis-perceive it that way solely and wholly because
[1:39:13.200 --> 1:39:17.840]  Capitol Police instigated some of the behavior that day. That's the key. That is actually the
[1:39:17.840 --> 1:39:22.480]  key right there. And I was reviewing some of the footage actually this morning. I don't know why.
[1:39:22.480 --> 1:39:27.840]  It just popped up on my timeline. And so I was reviewing some of it. There is zero doubt that
[1:39:27.840 --> 1:39:33.520]  that Democrats or Feds or Antifa or whoever had their people on the front lines instigating
[1:39:33.520 --> 1:39:37.680]  police, had their people on the front lines instigating to go over the barriers. You had the
[1:39:37.680 --> 1:39:42.320]  ray-epsis of the world saying we're going into the Capitol. That element did exist. Very small
[1:39:42.320 --> 1:39:48.160]  fringe element most likely paid or promoted provocateurs to be there. But really, when you
[1:39:48.160 --> 1:39:55.280]  review the footage, even that was not that effective because even when they had their
[1:39:55.280 --> 1:40:01.440]  first Antifa groups or Feds storming through the barriers, it wasn't like a big storm. It was still
[1:40:01.440 --> 1:40:05.200]  kind of very reserved. Like people looking around like, I don't know if we should be doing this.
[1:40:05.200 --> 1:40:09.040]  And then, you know, the people in the black saying, come on, ray-epsine, come on. And then, okay,
[1:40:09.040 --> 1:40:16.720]  they march forward, cops make another barrier. And then again, if you watch the overhead footage,
[1:40:16.720 --> 1:40:22.720]  the crowds of people are very reserved actually. Like there's like a 10-foot gap between the
[1:40:22.720 --> 1:40:26.880]  police line at the first when the Capitol gets breached. By the way, we weren't even there
[1:40:26.880 --> 1:40:31.280]  when this was going on. We were still at the ellipse. And there's like a 10-foot gap between
[1:40:31.280 --> 1:40:35.120]  the police and the large group of people. Because you can tell at that point, they're not really
[1:40:35.120 --> 1:40:37.840]  sure what's going on. They're not really sure if they're supposed to be there, but there's a million
[1:40:37.840 --> 1:40:42.400]  people. So they just kind of get herded into this. And then you have people in black fighting with
[1:40:42.400 --> 1:40:46.240]  the police and then everything kicks off. Police start lobbing grenades into the crowd. There was
[1:40:46.240 --> 1:40:50.080]  one guy that caught fire. I'd never seen this before. They hit him with like three grenades.
[1:40:50.080 --> 1:40:54.320]  Boom. He goes up in flames. And so now all of a sudden they're getting hit with grenades. They're
[1:40:54.320 --> 1:40:58.240]  getting hit with rubber bullets. They're like, what the heck is going on? And that's what really
[1:40:58.240 --> 1:41:02.400]  popped the whole thing off. Yeah. And you see that that's why they've been trying to hide the 10,000
[1:41:02.400 --> 1:41:06.960]  plus hours of video footage the U.S. government has concerning January 6th. Because, hey, you're
[1:41:06.960 --> 1:41:11.680]  allowed to do that. If that was going down against the Antifa BLM, the cops would be bad. But when
[1:41:11.680 --> 1:41:16.000]  they do it against Trump supporters, they're good. Oh, no doubt. I mean, the hypocrisy has been over
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:20.400]  the top. I mean, the only place that may be worse than the District of Columbia in terms of jury
[1:41:20.400 --> 1:41:26.320]  pools, judicial bias, prosecutorial prejudice, may be a certain county in Texas currently. But
[1:41:26.320 --> 1:41:32.480]  other than that, what you saw was a complete evisceration of certain principles of due process
[1:41:32.480 --> 1:41:38.640]  and discovery. Why? Because they can't let the full and whole truth out. Whenever you see any court,
[1:41:38.640 --> 1:41:44.720]  prosecutor, police, government, public official, hiding information and documentation from the
[1:41:44.720 --> 1:41:49.360]  court of public opinion, from the court of law, from a court of jurors, you know that that's
[1:41:49.360 --> 1:41:55.280]  because that information is exculpatory and counters their institutional and official narrative.
[1:41:55.280 --> 1:42:01.840]  If the 14,000 plus hours of various video footage from all over the Capitol that day
[1:42:01.840 --> 1:42:07.360]  helped their case, they would be releasing it all of it now. Instead, they're hiding it in mass.
[1:42:07.360 --> 1:42:12.080]  Because if they told the truth, it would reveal a very different narrative. Because it even goes
[1:42:12.080 --> 1:42:16.640]  further back. What was supposed to happen that day is people who were coming from the ellipse
[1:42:16.640 --> 1:42:20.800]  to come to the protest were to come to the protest across the other side of the Capitol.
[1:42:20.800 --> 1:42:25.040]  Where there was a stage for speakers. Exactly. Instead, as they're coming down,
[1:42:25.040 --> 1:42:30.800]  they're being misdirected into the wrong place into the Capitol to create this compressed crowd.
[1:42:30.800 --> 1:42:34.480]  With ray ups in the front. Exactly. Where they can't move, they can't get around,
[1:42:34.480 --> 1:42:39.200]  they can't get outside of it, they can't breach it. And all of a sudden, they're being forced
[1:42:39.200 --> 1:42:42.960]  into January 6th. And that's why they got to delete all those...
[1:42:42.960 --> 1:42:46.400]  Do you think, I mean, just quickly, do you think there's any way for the Republicans or anybody
[1:42:46.400 --> 1:42:52.400]  to judo this? If they're serious and sincere, they'll start doing it after January 6th, 2023.
[1:42:52.400 --> 1:43:19.200]  All right, Bob Barnes with us another segment. Don't go anywhere.

[1:45:45.760 --> 1:45:53.920]  formula is working for me. Quite well, I might add. Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and
[1:45:53.920 --> 1:45:58.160]  beard support for men. I go and see him quite often now. The globalists are fighting around
[1:45:58.160 --> 1:46:03.760]  the clock to destroy the family, to destroy heterosexual relationships, to annihilate our
[1:46:03.760 --> 1:46:10.960]  marriages and the studies are all clear. The number one cause of marital splits is that there is
[1:46:10.960 --> 1:46:17.680]  problems in the bedroom and the number one issue men have is erectile dysfunction. Ladies and gentlemen,
[1:46:17.680 --> 1:46:22.080]  the left makes big jokes about this because they don't want people having lasting good
[1:46:22.080 --> 1:46:27.520]  love and relationships. They want to break up society and we are so excited to have the number

[1:47:02.240 --> 1:47:21.760]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:21.760 --> 1:47:33.840]  Talk this one up with the Alex Jones was right list. He was right about this decades ago,
[1:47:34.640 --> 1:47:41.360]  specifically in response to the Patriot Act. FBI whistleblower leaks bureau's domestic terrorism
[1:47:41.360 --> 1:47:49.040]  symbols guide on militia violent extremists citing Ashley Babbitt. Leaked FBI list reveals
[1:47:49.040 --> 1:47:53.840]  gads and flags, second amendment, revolutionary war imagery as domestic terrorism symbols.
[1:47:55.040 --> 1:47:59.360]  I remember just going back, I wasn't watching Alex Jones at the time, but when I would watch
[1:47:59.360 --> 1:48:06.000]  older Alex Jones shows from post 9-11 in the coming weeks and then past the Patriot Act,
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:09.760]  he always said this is going to be used against the American people. It's going to be used to
[1:48:09.760 --> 1:48:17.120]  demonize American symbolism. Just totally proven. Now, I don't know if this is the same FBI whistleblower
[1:48:17.120 --> 1:48:23.680]  that leaked the documents to the GOP about how the FBI was targeting conservatives and how the FBI
[1:48:23.680 --> 1:48:28.240]  was pressuring DA's and other investigators to label Trump supporters domestic terrorists,
[1:48:28.960 --> 1:48:33.600]  but this is right up the list. If it's not the same FBI whistleblower, it just adds more power,
[1:48:33.600 --> 1:48:37.600]  I think, to this information coming out that multiple people inside the FBI are trying to
[1:48:37.600 --> 1:48:43.280]  warn America. So, I mean, what is your response to this? So now if you have an American flag,
[1:48:43.280 --> 1:48:50.240]  a Gadsden flag, a second amendment logo or anything like that, the FBI considers you a domestic terrorist.
[1:48:50.240 --> 1:48:55.760]  Well, there's two origins for this. The first is the Pactcon FBI conspiracy to create a fake
[1:48:55.760 --> 1:49:02.320]  militia movement in the United States in the early 1990s to infiltrate and instigate violence
[1:49:02.320 --> 1:49:08.640]  as a pretext and grounds to justify its surveillance and its budget in a post-Cold War era.
[1:49:08.640 --> 1:49:13.200]  They denied that existed. They claim that they withheld the evidence during the Oklahoma City
[1:49:13.200 --> 1:49:17.600]  various trial proceedings. They withheld it from the public and only got disclosed,
[1:49:17.600 --> 1:49:22.880]  I think, in 2008. They finally revealed, oh, yeah, we actually had a fake militia movement.
[1:49:22.880 --> 1:49:27.840]  What came out in the Whitmer trial recently? The FBI has recreated a fake militia movement
[1:49:27.840 --> 1:49:34.080]  they had people taking fake oaths to in order to instigate and originate and create crimes that
[1:49:34.080 --> 1:49:39.360]  didn't otherwise exist. What's stunning about what you're talking about, and I mean, we need
[1:49:39.360 --> 1:49:43.920]  a master list, honestly, it might be out there, but there needs to be a master list. The majority
[1:49:43.920 --> 1:49:50.480]  of mass shooters had prior contact or the FBI was aware of them, or there's been cases where
[1:49:50.480 --> 1:49:55.360]  there was a Dallas shooter a couple years ago, you just mentioned the plot to kidnap the governor,
[1:49:55.360 --> 1:50:00.960]  literally were FBI plots. It was literally 100% FBI agents that ran the whole thing,
[1:50:01.680 --> 1:50:06.240]  and then whoever was not a fed that got caught up in it, they end up getting charged.
[1:50:06.240 --> 1:50:10.320]  Oh, exactly. And if you go a little bit further and you go a little bit deeper and a little bit
[1:50:10.320 --> 1:50:14.240]  wider, you'll find there's another parallel to all of this, and it's called the so-called labeling
[1:50:14.240 --> 1:50:20.160]  of illegal tax protesters. This was the IRS chose to label people who raised questions about the
[1:50:20.160 --> 1:50:26.800]  legal scope of the income tax and its application to them as individuals were being secretly labeled
[1:50:26.800 --> 1:50:33.760]  ITP illegal tax protesters inside their internal IRS databases, and then they were being discriminated
[1:50:33.760 --> 1:50:38.880]  against, being targeted for audits, being discriminated against and denied their due process rights
[1:50:38.880 --> 1:50:44.560]  under the various due process laws that apply to the taxpayer bill of rights passed in 1998,
[1:50:44.560 --> 1:50:49.200]  so on and so forth, from some litigation that I held brought that led to an end to that,
[1:50:49.200 --> 1:50:53.680]  because it was a clear due process violation. Remember, then go back to Lois Lerner creating
[1:50:53.680 --> 1:50:58.640]  a Tea Party and target list that actually originated out of targeting so-called tax protesters.
[1:50:58.640 --> 1:51:04.240]  Same deal to use, weaponize the IRS to go after people who are dissidents and their political
[1:51:04.240 --> 1:51:08.240]  adversaries of the then Obama administration. Now look at what's happening. We're seeing a
[1:51:08.240 --> 1:51:12.720]  parallel of it again. We're seeing the FBI with whistleblowers reporting and disclosing
[1:51:12.720 --> 1:51:16.880]  that they're being encouraged to dummy up fake cases, not go out and investigate a crime that's
[1:51:16.880 --> 1:51:23.120]  reported, but go out and either create a crime by entrapping someone into doing a crime or simply
[1:51:23.120 --> 1:51:27.200]  relabel something, a crime that it isn't solely in order to meet their performance metrics,
[1:51:27.200 --> 1:51:31.840]  which require they identify a bunch of people as domestic terrorists who in fact are not actually
[1:51:31.840 --> 1:51:36.160]  domestic terrorists, and labeling political activists in that category as long as they're
[1:51:36.160 --> 1:51:40.720]  the political adversary of the Biden administration. You're going to see the same thing now happen at
[1:51:40.720 --> 1:51:46.640]  the IRS level. There's a reason the Biden budget has a bunch of money for a bunch of new IRS agents
[1:51:46.640 --> 1:51:51.840]  to go out and harass and harangue people. You can bet that they're going to be targeting
[1:51:51.840 --> 1:51:55.680]  the political dissidents, those who disagree with the Biden administration,
[1:51:55.680 --> 1:52:00.320]  those who question and contest the institutional narrative on any topic of importance to the
[1:52:00.320 --> 1:52:04.800]  Biden administration. So we're going to see what happened in the past come back to us in real
[1:52:04.800 --> 1:52:11.760]  live time. You know, I want to be historically accurate in my description of the modern day
[1:52:11.760 --> 1:52:17.840]  Democrat Party, and I'm not the most well researched historian, but I've learned a lot over the years.
[1:52:18.400 --> 1:52:24.480]  And where the Democrat Party is going right now, it really is. It has all the earmarks.
[1:52:24.480 --> 1:52:30.400]  It has all the trademarks of a totalitarian, authoritarian, oppressive, and eventually
[1:52:30.400 --> 1:52:35.040]  murderous regime. Everything that they're doing, the censorship of their opposition,
[1:52:35.040 --> 1:52:38.960]  the imprisonment of their opposition, the persecution of their opposition,
[1:52:38.960 --> 1:52:44.480]  the lies and the propaganda that they tell 24 seven, their attempts to steal and rig
[1:52:44.480 --> 1:52:48.880]  elections. I mean, I just see all of it. The false flags, the false flags. I mean,
[1:52:48.880 --> 1:52:53.040]  just these small, I mean, don't act like that wasn't a Democrat playing false flag to demonize
[1:52:53.040 --> 1:52:59.200]  Trump supporters. Come on, man. So where do you look at the Democrat Party right now as far as the
[1:52:59.200 --> 1:53:05.920]  history of evil on this planet is concerned? Because to me, they're like one or two clicks away
[1:53:05.920 --> 1:53:11.680]  from being as murderous and evil as some of the most evil murderous groups this planet's ever seen.
[1:53:11.680 --> 1:53:16.400]  I think the greater danger isn't just their politics and their policies, but it is their
[1:53:16.400 --> 1:53:21.120]  lack of competence and capabilities that they could lead us bumbling and stumbling into another
[1:53:21.120 --> 1:53:26.800]  global war. And this time a global war with two nuclear powers in Russia and China. That to me is
[1:53:26.800 --> 1:53:32.880]  the most imminent existential threat that they present. Now there's like a Pelosi getting on
[1:53:32.880 --> 1:53:39.760]  a plane and going to Taiwan for a photo op exactly like funding a neo-nazi corrupt regime regime in
[1:53:39.760 --> 1:53:45.840]  Ukraine and trying to trigger Russia in every way possible to trigger a potential nuclear war
[1:53:45.840 --> 1:53:50.240]  with the greatest nuclear arsenal in the world. By the way, the Biden administration announced
[1:53:50.240 --> 1:53:56.080]  550 million for Ukraine two days ago. Today they just announced another 185 billion. Yeah, I mean
[1:53:56.080 --> 1:54:01.040]  just the money is pouring in and why get it's a deep state budget that's basically meant to come
[1:54:01.040 --> 1:54:06.000]  back to a lot of US connected politicians and enrich the hunter-bidens of the world. The fact
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:11.360]  that we're continuing to funnel arms, dangerous arms into a conflict that will only lead to
[1:54:11.360 --> 1:54:16.960]  escalation of that conflict creates undue and unnecessary risk. And we do this right on top of
[1:54:16.960 --> 1:54:22.160]  trying to do something in the Balkans just as early this week in Kosovo, which is what led to World War
[1:54:22.160 --> 1:54:27.840]  I, what got triggered there. So these people are so incompetent and so dangerous in their policies
[1:54:27.840 --> 1:54:32.880]  and their political preferences that they could lead as bumbling and stumbling unintentionally
[1:54:32.880 --> 1:54:38.320]  into global nuclear war. And that's if they don't screw up the planet with their various vaccines
[1:54:38.320 --> 1:54:42.800]  that are not really vaccines that are portrayed as safe, that are not portrayed as effective,
[1:54:42.800 --> 1:54:48.240]  that are not. And we're seeing more and more accumulating injuries. How many doctors in Canada
[1:54:48.240 --> 1:54:53.440]  have to die? How many people have to continue to drop dead celebrities, sports stars for unexplained
[1:54:53.440 --> 1:54:58.480]  reasons? They will be literally, sudden adult death syndrome is somehow a thing now. New thing,
[1:54:58.480 --> 1:55:03.840]  yeah. I mean, it's called sad. I mean, you couldn't make this up if you were like a dark version,
[1:55:03.840 --> 1:55:07.840]  a nihilistic version of Babylon B, you couldn't come up with these headlines. And yet that's
[1:55:07.840 --> 1:55:12.160]  what's happening. So between the public health arena and the foreign policy arena, that's where
[1:55:12.160 --> 1:55:18.640]  they pose the greatest risk of serious problems at a lasting level for the entire globe.
[1:55:18.640 --> 1:55:24.160]  Isn't it surreal though? I mean, it's so surreal to be witnessing all of this and I mean, to be kind
[1:55:24.160 --> 1:55:31.040]  of in the center of it in a way right here at Info Wars. I mean, I can't even believe it
[1:55:32.160 --> 1:55:37.280]  coming from somebody who really hasn't even been political or following news for maybe but 10 years
[1:55:37.280 --> 1:55:41.040]  now. I mean, it's just wild to think about the history that we're living, to think about the
[1:55:41.040 --> 1:55:46.480]  history we're witnessing. Men are women, men can get pregnant. I mean, total political persecution
[1:55:46.480 --> 1:55:50.640]  just outright lies and propaganda from our government, from the mainstream media. I mean,
[1:55:50.640 --> 1:55:56.880]  it really is twilight zone science fiction level dystopia that we're entering. And you just hope
[1:55:56.880 --> 1:56:01.520]  like, when is the awakening going to happen? I mean, we're still humans, we still have
[1:56:01.520 --> 1:56:05.760]  consciousness, we still can think critically like, when does the mass awakening happening,
[1:56:05.760 --> 1:56:09.120]  realizing where we're going right now if we don't reverse course quickly?
[1:56:09.120 --> 1:56:13.440]  What we're seeing is sort of little episodic moments of some of the worst times in world
[1:56:13.440 --> 1:56:17.280]  history all happening at the same time, whether it's the eugenics movement of the early 20th
[1:56:17.280 --> 1:56:22.720]  century and World War One and the rise of Nazis and socialism and fascism and communism in the
[1:56:22.720 --> 1:56:28.480]  1940s, whether it's in how the brutal South responded to civil rights movement with weaponizing
[1:56:28.480 --> 1:56:32.720]  the legal system against dissidents and civil rights activists, whether it's the criminalization
[1:56:32.720 --> 1:56:36.960]  of political disagreement, which we've seen only sporadically in the history of the United States.
[1:56:36.960 --> 1:56:42.800]  We're seeing all of this happen at the same time. Why? It's not because they have great power.
[1:56:42.800 --> 1:56:47.120]  As Michael Mallis said, the fact that you could have a guy wearing a buffalo hat be considered
[1:56:47.120 --> 1:56:51.360]  a scary insurrectionist in the middle of the Capitol and that you have a dementia candidate
[1:56:51.360 --> 1:56:56.560]  like Joe Biden as president is not a sign of the strength of the system, just as their retaliatory
[1:56:56.560 --> 1:57:02.000]  methods are not the sign of the strength. It's a sign of a despairing dying system that knows
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:07.600]  it is at the end of its rope because the mass public, the great awokening led to the great
[1:57:07.600 --> 1:57:11.520]  awakening and the great awakening is going to revolutionize the world, but they're going to
[1:57:11.520 --> 1:57:17.040]  do everything imaginable to stop that from happening before it actually reaches critical mass.
[1:57:17.040 --> 1:57:22.400]  So that's why you're seeing such global risk being taken by the globalist in general,
[1:57:22.400 --> 1:57:26.960]  whether it's war, whether it's public health disasters, whether it's incompetent politicians.
[1:57:26.960 --> 1:57:31.360]  We will indeed live in interesting times because we have people that are waking up to the reality
[1:57:31.360 --> 1:57:34.000]  of the world and trying to make a difference every way they can.
[1:58:03.040 --> 1:58:07.840]  So now realize we have pushed them out of the light, we have pushed them out in the open and
[1:58:07.840 --> 1:58:12.480]  they are so upset and they are so scared. So while you still can, because any day can be our last

[2:00:04.240 --> 2:00:31.520]  By officiating the unproven theory that petroleum oil is a non renewable fossil fuel,
[2:00:31.520 --> 2:00:37.600]  the oil companies were able to adjust the price accordingly all the way into the peak oil scare
[2:00:37.600 --> 2:00:43.200]  that foretold the collect of the world soon running out of oil, which further benefited the
[2:00:43.200 --> 2:00:50.880]  industry pricing schemes. The wells never did go dry and the one once emptied filled back up.
[2:00:50.880 --> 2:00:57.600]  So the science we have today favor the abiotic theory over the fossil fuel theory, which is that
[2:00:57.600 --> 2:01:05.120]  oil is a natural renewable component of our ecosystem. And we see this in our oceans,
[2:01:05.120 --> 2:01:11.760]  underwater methane lakes deep beneath the surface with their own unique thriving ecosystems.
[2:01:12.400 --> 2:01:19.280]  And so the story changed from the world will soon run out of oil to the world will most
[2:01:19.280 --> 2:01:25.680]  certainly end if we don't stop using oil. And because nobody seems to know what science is
[2:01:25.680 --> 2:01:32.720]  anymore and most people just do as they're told the world is about to end for millions of people
[2:01:32.720 --> 2:01:39.200]  and probably more because our civilization is built upon fossil fuels and the powers that
[2:01:39.200 --> 2:01:46.880]  be are turning them off. Winter is coming and Germany is set to be very cold. Angela Merkel
[2:01:46.880 --> 2:01:53.360]  saved her political career by appeasing the anti nuclear movement and shutting down Germany's
[2:01:53.360 --> 2:02:00.160]  nuclear power. Out of 17 plants, they have already shut down 11 and are still in the process of
[2:02:00.160 --> 2:02:07.680]  shutting down the rest, removing 25% of their power without anything to replace it because
[2:02:07.680 --> 2:02:13.920]  their green deal turned out to be a failure. After all the hype, Germany's dependence on
[2:02:13.920 --> 2:02:21.520]  fossil fuel is at 76%. So they are temporarily switching back to coal and oil. But that's
[2:02:21.520 --> 2:02:27.120]  a real problem because they've neglected their own fuel industry and become dependent upon Russia's
[2:02:27.680 --> 2:02:33.120]  and the German government would rather have the country freeze to death than buy fuel from Russia.
[2:02:33.680 --> 2:02:40.000]  The German economy is based on highly innovative production, which requires a great deal of energy
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:46.480]  that they no longer produce. And so running out of fuel will quickly collapse the German economy,
[2:02:46.480 --> 2:02:51.920]  which will cause a tsunami of economic destruction throughout the EU and the world.
[2:02:52.960 --> 2:02:58.720]  And the German government is letting it happen. They could leave some nuclear plants online,
[2:02:58.720 --> 2:03:04.400]  but they still plan on shutting it all down by the end of this year to stay green. Some
[2:03:04.400 --> 2:03:10.960]  anti carbon environmentalists are saying that nuclear power is the greenest option. And maybe
[2:03:10.960 --> 2:03:17.680]  that's true, but none of their schemes add up. So far, the green agenda has only successfully
[2:03:17.680 --> 2:03:23.200]  accomplished making people feel good about themselves while they destroy their own society.
[2:03:23.920 --> 2:03:30.480]  The EU and Britain are actually reverting back to burning wood as fuel and claim that it is
[2:03:30.480 --> 2:03:36.880]  carbon neutral, which is a lie. Societies have steadily evolved towards a cleaner, more efficient
[2:03:36.880 --> 2:03:43.280]  energy starting from wood, the least clean and efficient and moving to coal followed by oil
[2:03:43.280 --> 2:03:51.600]  and gas. And now nearly 40% of Europe's renewable energy is wood, which mostly comes from clear
[2:03:51.600 --> 2:03:59.200]  cutting forests in the United States. This new green deal is a complete lie. It's just another
[2:03:59.200 --> 2:04:07.040]  part of the creepy elites great reset. These elite bloodlines want a new cashless society,
[2:04:07.040 --> 2:04:12.800]  but one more like the Middle Ages, which for these spoiled inbreds is the good old days.
[2:04:13.440 --> 2:04:20.240]  And if they succeed, it looks like Germany will get there first. And in the midst of all this chaos,
[2:04:20.240 --> 2:04:26.720]  the German government is focused on allowing children age 14 and older to change their gender
[2:04:26.720 --> 2:04:32.320]  and first names without parental permission once a year for as often as they want.
[2:04:32.320 --> 2:04:57.600]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Ries.
[2:04:57.600 --> 2:05:02.480]  InfoWars has been vindicated. We've been proven right. World government, the New World Order is
[2:05:02.480 --> 2:05:08.720]  out of the open. And now more than ever, the forces of Satan are trying to shut down this
[2:05:08.720 --> 2:05:14.960]  broadcast. The forces of anti-human, godless New World Order are out of control. So now realize,
[2:05:15.520 --> 2:05:19.840]  we have pushed them out of the light, we have pushed them out in the open and they are so upset
[2:05:19.840 --> 2:05:24.240]  and they are so scared. So while you still can, because any day can be our last broadcast,
[2:05:24.240 --> 2:05:28.000]  spread the word about the show, share the article, share the videos, and please
[2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:34.480]  fund us while getting great products at the same time at infowarsstore.com. Books, films,
[2:05:34.480 --> 2:05:40.640]  t-shirts, great supplements, vitamin real fusion, body cells metomeric formula, Ultra 12,
[2:05:40.640 --> 2:05:46.880]  diet force, so much more right now at infowarsore.com. But whatever you do, pray for justice and pray
[2:05:46.880 --> 2:05:51.840]  for freedom and pray for the children and pray for free speech and justice to win.
[2:05:51.840 --> 2:05:56.000]  Thank you so much for joining us. I'll spread the word my friends. We're involved in an epic
[2:05:56.000 --> 2:05:56.880]  historic battle.
[2:06:04.320 --> 2:06:12.080]  You've found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[2:06:12.080 --> 2:06:28.160]  Have you secured your copy of the great reset and the war for the world by Alex Jones yet?
[2:06:28.160 --> 2:06:33.920]  Have you secured your copy? Get it fast, folks. We sold out at infowarsstore.com,
[2:06:33.920 --> 2:06:39.920]  but you can still purchase it on Amazon and keep Alex Jones' new book at the top of the
[2:06:39.920 --> 2:06:46.400]  bestseller list. It's the great reset and the war for the world by Alex Jones. Get it on Amazon
[2:06:46.400 --> 2:06:53.200]  today. We don't like promoting Amazon, obviously, but it's nice in the culture wars to go on to
[2:06:53.200 --> 2:06:58.720]  Amazon, purchase the book there, and then watch it go to number one on the bestseller charts,
[2:06:58.720 --> 2:07:05.680]  which it has, but we got to keep it there, the great reset and the war for the world by Alex
[2:07:05.680 --> 2:07:16.960]  Jones. And ladies and gentlemen, we have back in stock what was once the most popular toothpaste
[2:07:17.520 --> 2:07:23.520]  on the site. Super blue fluoride free toothpaste is back at infowarsstore.com. This was my favorite
[2:07:23.520 --> 2:07:30.880]  toothpaste until we launched super coral whitening toothpaste, also fluoride free,
[2:07:30.880 --> 2:07:37.440]  natural whitening with coral calcium, good for healthy teeth and gums. This is the fresh mint
[2:07:37.440 --> 2:07:43.200]  with xylitol and essential oils. This is my go to now for toothpaste, the super coral whitening
[2:07:43.200 --> 2:07:49.600]  toothpaste, but a close second is super blue fluoride free toothpaste with iodine and tea

[2:08:45.040 --> 2:08:55.920]  All right. Man, oh man, let's start playing some of these video clips that we have here.
[2:08:58.080 --> 2:09:04.960]  Joe Biden, his new Inflation Reduction Act turns out to be a giant lie.
[2:09:06.720 --> 2:09:12.240]  The Biden tax hikes would shrink the economy, kill tens of thousands of jobs, lower wages,
[2:09:12.240 --> 2:09:18.800]  and worsen inflation. That's what the researchers that have read the actual act have determined.
[2:09:20.240 --> 2:09:27.680]  And so Joe Biden lied. He lied about the bill and he lied about not raising taxes on Americans
[2:09:27.680 --> 2:09:34.960]  in his campaign. And so here is a short clip put together showing you how Biden lied about not
[2:09:34.960 --> 2:09:49.760]  raising taxes. President Biden breaking his promise not to raise taxes on the middle class.
[2:09:49.760 --> 2:09:55.120]  The Senate Democrats looked to fast track a bill that multiple now nonpartisan experts say
[2:09:55.120 --> 2:10:00.240]  would raise taxes on nearly all Americans. Give you my word as a Biden, no one making less than
[2:10:00.240 --> 2:10:06.720]  $400,000 a year will see a penny in their taxes rate. The average tax rate for nearly
[2:10:06.720 --> 2:10:12.480]  every income bracket would increase. I want to impose any tax increase on people making less
[2:10:12.480 --> 2:10:21.600]  than $400,000. Taxes will rise by $16.7 billion in 2023 on Americans earning less than $200,000 a
[2:10:21.600 --> 2:10:28.240]  year. No one earning less than $400,000 you will pay a single penny more in federal tax. Joe Biden
[2:10:28.240 --> 2:10:32.480]  just drawn the line at $400,000 a year. The committee does say it would raise taxes on people
[2:10:32.480 --> 2:10:41.280]  below that line. Yeah, Joe Biden, he's a liar. Democrats, they're liars. They are the political
[2:10:41.280 --> 2:10:51.280]  corruption that this country needs to rid itself of. Even Obama said in, he was 2008 when he was
[2:10:51.280 --> 2:10:59.200]  campaigning famously Obama said, you don't raise taxes during a time of inflation. You don't raise
[2:10:59.200 --> 2:11:05.360]  taxes during a time of recession. Funny, even Obama knew that. And now the Democrats are doing
[2:11:05.360 --> 2:11:12.240]  just that because they want to crush you. Don't you see the Democrat Party is all about crushing
[2:11:12.240 --> 2:11:19.120]  you. Why do you think the poorest parts in America are all run by Democrats? Why do you think
[2:11:19.120 --> 2:11:24.320]  cities that are run by Democrats have the highest crime rates, the highest poverty rates, and the
[2:11:24.320 --> 2:11:30.400]  highest homelessness rates? It's by design. That's Democrat Party politics to crush you.
[2:11:31.920 --> 2:11:36.880]  Because you're a bad human. Don't you see you're inherently bad because you're a human. You're
[2:11:36.880 --> 2:11:41.840]  inherently bad because you're an American. And so therefore Democrats are here to crush you.
[2:11:41.840 --> 2:11:52.320]  Get it? Better figure it out before they flatten us all. You're seeing it in real time.
[2:11:53.840 --> 2:12:00.400]  Let's stick with this clown administration. Let's go to Karine Jean Pierre. Here she is
[2:12:00.400 --> 2:12:06.960]  trying to promote the monkeypox vaccine in clip 20 and just ends up embarrassing herself.
[2:12:06.960 --> 2:12:19.680]  I really need them. And so if you think about the 737,000 and the 300,000 plus that we have put
[2:12:21.200 --> 2:12:25.440]  Yeah, she can't even talk. She can't even read off of her little pad that she has all of her
[2:12:25.440 --> 2:12:29.280]  answers on. Oh boy, oh boy, by the way,
[2:12:29.280 --> 2:12:39.760]  everybody knows that the monkeypox outbreak is is a direct causation or a direct correlation
[2:12:39.760 --> 2:12:47.360]  to gay pride month. Everybody knows it. They were having their gay orgies. And now there's a monkey
[2:12:47.360 --> 2:12:53.440]  pox outbreak. And they just say, Hey, you know, don't stop having gay orgies. That's not your fault
[2:12:53.440 --> 2:12:59.520]  that you're spreading monkeypox. That's everyone else's fault. So they take the COVID approach
[2:13:00.320 --> 2:13:04.000]  and say, we've all got to be locked down. We've all got to respond. We've all got to get the
[2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:11.760]  monkeypox vaccines. Even though we know it's 99% of the cases are gay men having gay orgies.
[2:13:12.320 --> 2:13:16.400]  And then there's a couple children that quote unquote had contact with gay men.
[2:13:17.520 --> 2:13:20.880]  But hey, they want you to be afraid of monkeypox. They want you to take that monkeypox vaccine.
[2:13:20.880 --> 2:13:26.640]  And then here's Karine Jean-Pierre embarrassing herself again, trying to make a joke about Joe
[2:13:26.640 --> 2:13:31.440]  Biden's second or third or fourth bout with COVID or whatever's going on with him. Or he has cancer,
[2:13:31.440 --> 2:13:57.440]  dementia ads, you know, it's a whole thing here's Karine Jean-Pierre failing to make a joke. Well,
[2:13:57.440 --> 2:14:07.600]  the day's still young. You never know. But what the president is making a joke. Clearly it wasn't
[2:14:07.600 --> 2:14:17.440]  a funny joke. I will try harder next time to be more funny. But look, he is continuing to work
[2:14:17.440 --> 2:14:23.280]  from the residents. And I just want to share, as we all know, the president is fully vaccinated.
[2:14:23.280 --> 2:14:29.680]  He's fully, he's double boosted. He was on treatment for Pax Lovett. And because of that,
[2:14:30.640 --> 2:14:36.560]  still has COVID though. Our press secretary is a cabbage patch doll.
[2:14:38.240 --> 2:14:44.960]  Our press secretary is a cabbage patch doll. Our president apparently has cancer or dementia or
[2:14:44.960 --> 2:14:54.240]  permanent COVID or who knows. He's a joke. Kamala Harris is a cackling, bumbling idiot.
[2:14:54.240 --> 2:15:02.000]  We've got a clip of her fumbling her way through a public press address yesterday. We'll play that
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:07.440]  coming up. You've got multiple men in this administration that think they're women. And
[2:15:07.440 --> 2:15:15.760]  you've got a drunken, decrepit, reanimated corpse, Nancy Pelosi flying around high on her own ego
[2:15:15.760 --> 2:15:21.200]  that could potentially start a larger conflict with China and is certainly, certainly spitting in
[2:15:21.200 --> 2:15:26.960]  the eye of China as her family makes millions of dollars in China. And she does insider trading
[2:15:26.960 --> 2:15:34.400]  with computer chip and processor deals. Yeah, this country is in big trouble with the Democrat
[2:15:34.400 --> 2:15:43.120]  party, not just in power, but existing. The, the very ideology of modern day liberalism
[2:15:44.240 --> 2:15:48.320]  is a threat to all things that are pro-human, pro-freedom, pro-reality, pro-truth,
[2:15:49.600 --> 2:15:54.080]  and in all things good. The Democrat party and modern day liberalism is a threat to all things

[2:20:33.920 --> 2:20:41.600]  You want to know why you had the final result on the abortion vote in Kansas yesterday?
[2:20:43.120 --> 2:20:49.520]  Let me just read to you. Let me just read to you what was on the ballot and you tell me if you
[2:20:49.520 --> 2:20:54.080]  have any freaking clue what you're voting for after I read this. So yes or no question on the
[2:20:54.080 --> 2:21:02.960]  ballot in Kansas last night because this is subsection 22 if you voted in Kansas, regulation
[2:21:02.960 --> 2:21:11.680]  of abortion. Because Kansans value both women and children, the Constitution of the state of
[2:21:11.680 --> 2:21:17.760]  Kansas does not require a government funding of abortion and does not create or secure a right to
[2:21:17.760 --> 2:21:23.040]  abortion. To the extent permitted by the Constitution of the United States, the people through their
[2:21:23.040 --> 2:21:28.400]  elected state representatives and state senators may pass laws regarding abortion including but
[2:21:28.400 --> 2:21:34.080]  not limited to laws that account for circumstances of pregnancy resulting from rape or incest or
[2:21:34.080 --> 2:21:39.840]  circumstances of necessity to save the life of the mother. Yes or no?
[2:21:43.040 --> 2:21:49.600]  Do you have any idea what you're voting on? Do you know what a yes or a no vote means in that
[2:21:49.600 --> 2:21:56.480]  situation? I can't make any sense of it and by the way this is what our politicians do to us
[2:21:56.480 --> 2:22:05.200]  all the time. Whoever writes these things on the ballot, I don't get it unless the idea is to
[2:22:05.200 --> 2:22:12.240]  intentionally deceive the voter. I don't know why they word it like this and really I mean look I
[2:22:12.240 --> 2:22:16.960]  know how corrupt our politicians are. I know how deceiving and backstabbing and how much resent
[2:22:16.960 --> 2:22:22.480]  they hold for the American voter in their heart but why would you want something so confusing on
[2:22:22.480 --> 2:22:26.800]  the ballot if you're trying to get people to vote a certain way and now they don't even know where
[2:22:26.800 --> 2:22:34.800]  which way they're voting? Did any of that make sense to you? I almost want to just open up the
[2:22:34.800 --> 2:22:39.680]  phone lines people in Kansas and say do you think you voted right on this issue? Do you even know
[2:22:39.680 --> 2:22:45.600]  what a yes or a no on this even means? But here's why I think here's why I'm pretty confident this
[2:22:45.600 --> 2:22:53.840]  is written by liberals because they play a standard game here that pollsters play or that people that
[2:22:53.840 --> 2:23:05.040]  make online polls play or that people that write these short essays that you have to go vote for
[2:23:05.040 --> 2:23:12.000]  that don't make any sense. So they say because Kansans value both women and children right out
[2:23:12.000 --> 2:23:16.720]  of the gate so that's all you're going to remember out of the gates. Oh I value women and children
[2:23:16.720 --> 2:23:20.640]  and then at the and then what is the last thing? Save the life of the mother.
[2:23:23.040 --> 2:23:27.280]  Now what do you think people are going to do? Are they going to vote yes or no when all they're
[2:23:27.280 --> 2:23:32.800]  going to comprehend from that is value women and children save the life of a mother? How do you
[2:23:32.800 --> 2:23:37.120]  think they're going to vote yes or no? That's all they could comprehend from this gobbledygook
[2:23:37.120 --> 2:23:44.400]  that's on the ballot in Kansas. Of course they're going to vote yes. Now I don't even remember because
[2:23:45.120 --> 2:23:49.200]  I just read it again on air. You vote yes you vote no I don't have a freaking clue what you just
[2:23:49.200 --> 2:23:54.960]  voted for but guys pull it up for me so I can make sure I'm accurate here. I believe it was yes
[2:23:54.960 --> 2:24:00.400]  that one it was like 60 to 40 I think in Kansas last night. Will you guys find that for me and
[2:24:00.400 --> 2:24:11.840]  pull that up? Kansas is a conservative state usually a red state. I mean as long as you're not in
[2:24:15.440 --> 2:24:22.480]  I guess where are the college towns there it's like Manhattan and where's the other college
[2:24:22.480 --> 2:24:26.800]  town I can't remember so it actually ends up being no that wins. Now see that surprises me.
[2:24:26.800 --> 2:24:33.200]  I think that the trickery of the wording there would get people to vote yes but maybe they were
[2:24:33.200 --> 2:24:38.560]  so confused by the trickery they thought they were being tricked so they voted no. I can't tell you
[2:24:38.560 --> 2:24:42.800]  after reading that whether a yes or a no is pro-abortion or anti-abortion or anything it doesn't
[2:24:42.800 --> 2:24:49.920]  make any sense but no wins and they say see people love abortion in Kansas see it proves people
[2:24:49.920 --> 2:24:57.680]  love abortion. I don't think people even knew what they were voting for and by the way I believe
[2:24:57.680 --> 2:25:03.520]  there was more evidence of that last night when you look at some of these results most of the
[2:25:03.520 --> 2:25:08.720]  people that go to vote probably have no freaking clue what they're voting for. I would say half the
[2:25:08.720 --> 2:25:13.520]  people that go vote don't know who's running don't know what's on the ballot they just go vote and
[2:25:13.520 --> 2:25:21.600]  just fill it out and that's part of the problem here and quite frankly that's what politicians
[2:25:21.600 --> 2:25:26.640]  from both parties know and that's why there's so much corruption because they know the average American
[2:25:26.640 --> 2:25:33.280]  voter is ignorant and so that's why they run all kinds of deceptive ads and propaganda to trick
[2:25:33.280 --> 2:25:39.040]  them and to pull at their emotional heartstrings knowing that this ignorant voter is going to go
[2:25:39.040 --> 2:25:42.640]  in there but it's going to remember maybe one ad or maybe one thing that tugged at their emotional
[2:25:42.640 --> 2:25:46.000]  heartstrings maybe that's abortion maybe it's something else and then they're going to go vote
[2:25:46.720 --> 2:25:52.880]  and they don't even know what they're voting for and that's a big problem that we have is ignorant
[2:25:52.880 --> 2:26:01.440]  voters but you're not allowed to talk about hey should you have to be informed to go vote should
[2:26:01.440 --> 2:26:05.840]  you be able to read to go vote should you even know who or what you're voting for to go vote
[2:26:05.840 --> 2:26:10.240]  you're not allowed to do that that's considered racist and then when you realize all the other
[2:26:10.240 --> 2:26:15.760]  things that the american left and the democrat party has done to our country under the guise of
[2:26:15.760 --> 2:26:22.400]  fighting racism that's been so damaging maybe you go back and reevaluate that maybe you do
[2:26:24.160 --> 2:26:29.200]  now i said i would play this kamala harris clip so let's go it now here's kamala harris on a zoom
[2:26:29.200 --> 2:26:34.480]  call addressing some uh young americans or i don't know i mean this woman is so pathetic this woman
[2:26:34.480 --> 2:26:41.360]  is such a joke the democrats think well joe biden isn't really a good thing so let's get rid of him
[2:26:41.360 --> 2:26:45.760]  but then they see who's in the depth chart behind him and it's kamala harris and they say whoa
[2:26:45.760 --> 2:26:50.960]  actually never mind we'll stick with joe biden imagine that you're so abysmal you're such a
[2:26:50.960 --> 2:26:56.400]  joke that the democrats would rather have joe biden remain in power with the lowest approval
[2:26:56.400 --> 2:27:01.040]  ratings of all time then go to kamala harris who has the lowest vice presidential approval ratings
[2:27:01.040 --> 2:27:11.840]  of our time uh here's the latest embarrassment from kamala harris in clip 23 that's the vice
[2:27:11.840 --> 2:27:17.520]  president well can we give it up for the first second gentleman of the united states of the
[2:27:22.160 --> 2:27:27.520]  look at all the learnings and i'm listen let me just i want to talk about my husband for a second
[2:27:27.520 --> 2:27:34.400]  my husband i love my husband um what let me tell you one of the things that has been so
[2:27:34.400 --> 2:27:40.320]  wonderful to see about who we are as democrats and who joe biden is when he said i know that a
[2:27:40.320 --> 2:27:48.720]  woman can be vice president right is that with that came another history making event which
[2:27:48.720 --> 2:27:55.280]  is there is now not a second lady but a second gentleman and what that means let's think about
[2:27:55.280 --> 2:27:59.600]  it because i'm gonna talk for a moment in a moment about what we stand for as democrats
[2:27:59.600 --> 2:28:04.720]  oh and a lot of what we stand for if you want to step back and think about higher taxes communism
[2:28:04.720 --> 2:28:12.640]  killing babies open borders the possibilities possibilities have an ability to see what is
[2:28:12.640 --> 2:28:21.440]  possible what can be unburdened by what has been no you are the burden you literally are the burden

[2:28:29.120 --> 2:28:33.040]  why do democrat women always talk differently depending on their crowds have you notice that
[2:28:33.040 --> 2:28:39.680]  aoc does it hillary clinton does it kamala harris does it even amy clobachar has done it
[2:28:41.280 --> 2:28:45.040]  reshita to leave why do they have different ways of talking depending on who they're talking to
[2:28:45.040 --> 2:28:50.400]  have you noticed that they have different ways of speaking and because their frauds and their
[2:28:50.400 --> 2:28:57.600]  phonies so they hide behind changing the way they speak to pretend they're smart info wars has

[2:33:03.120 --> 2:33:25.360]  live from the info wars.com studios you're listening to the alex joneshow and now your host oren shroyer
[2:33:28.320 --> 2:33:32.480]  you know if you really want to see how evil the current establishment is if you really want to
[2:33:32.480 --> 2:33:37.760]  see how evil the democrat party is i just encourage people just get a little politically active
[2:33:37.760 --> 2:33:43.520]  that's all you got to do just get a little politically active here's an example the louden
[2:33:43.520 --> 2:33:46.800]  county parents that go to the school board meetings what happens to them democrats call
[2:33:46.800 --> 2:33:52.960]  them domestic terrorists show up at their houses threaten them boy that didn't take much did it
[2:33:53.920 --> 2:33:57.120]  they just showed up at a school board meeting next thing you know democrats call them domestic
[2:33:57.120 --> 2:34:06.160]  terrorists so that's why i'm always encouraging people to just find your own outlet find your own
[2:34:06.160 --> 2:34:11.040]  way to get involved find your own way to get active it's not going to be media for all people it's not
[2:34:11.040 --> 2:34:15.600]  going to be school boards or running for office for all people might not be activism for all people
[2:34:15.600 --> 2:34:21.680]  but find find your lane find your role and just get a little politically active you got to america's
[2:34:21.680 --> 2:34:28.160]  in trouble right now freedom is in trouble right now our way of life is in trouble right now just
[2:34:28.160 --> 2:34:34.000]  get a little politically active just take a single political action and you're going to find out real
[2:34:34.000 --> 2:34:39.600]  quick how evil the american leftist they are going to come after you and you're going to be stunned
[2:34:39.600 --> 2:34:46.160]  it is going to be a major awakening process and that's what the case has been for a lot of americans
[2:34:46.160 --> 2:34:52.320]  that have just just gotten a little politically active maybe they go to a school board meeting
[2:34:52.320 --> 2:34:55.920]  maybe they go to a city council meeting maybe they run for office maybe they start a podcast and
[2:34:55.920 --> 2:35:02.480]  then what happens all the sudden you've got this massive group of liberals and leftists coming
[2:35:02.480 --> 2:35:10.000]  after you're trying to destroy your life and then you realize wow we really are dealing
[2:35:10.000 --> 2:35:16.320]  with serious political corruption and evil in this country and you know here's just another
[2:35:16.320 --> 2:35:23.920]  example steel dossier accused trump associate of trying to buy russian oil shares actually bought
[2:35:23.920 --> 2:35:35.440]  by hunter biden linked firm and i've talked about this before how the entire trump russia
[2:35:35.440 --> 2:35:40.560]  collusion narrative which was made up and written by hillary clinton and her campaign
[2:35:42.400 --> 2:35:50.240]  might have originally been targeting joe biden and all the narratives about the hookers and
[2:35:50.240 --> 2:35:57.600]  the bank deals were actually all meant to target the biden's because it really all came up during
[2:35:57.600 --> 2:36:05.040]  the presidential primaries of 2016 and it was hillary clinton trying to remove joe biden from
[2:36:05.040 --> 2:36:12.160]  the process and it worked and they ran a hit piece on biden in the new york times early or late in
[2:36:12.160 --> 2:36:18.960]  2015 or early 2016 i can't remember they ran the hit piece talking about biden and his connections to
[2:36:18.960 --> 2:36:24.400]  russia and his son's connections to russia just a little blurb in the new york times kind of just
[2:36:24.400 --> 2:36:29.760]  a little threat little threat from the clinton's letting the biden's know we'll come after you
[2:36:29.760 --> 2:36:33.360]  with the long knives we know what you and hunter are up to in russia we know about the hookers and
[2:36:33.360 --> 2:36:37.600]  everything so the biden said okay we don't want any of this we'll back out hillary it's yours
[2:36:39.040 --> 2:36:45.360]  and then all hillary's team had to do was replace the name hunter biden with donald trump
[2:36:45.360 --> 2:36:53.600]  and they all ran with it so i'm not of the firm belief that all the russian collusion bullcrap
[2:36:53.600 --> 2:36:58.240]  that came from the clinton campaign about trump was meant for hunter biden but i am certainly
[2:36:58.240 --> 2:37:07.360]  curious if that is not the true origin story and when you see this it adds a little more confidence
[2:37:08.320 --> 2:37:14.720]  in my belief that the entire russian collusion story was actually about the biden's and not trump
[2:37:16.320 --> 2:37:21.680]  so yeah oh it was donald trump was doing business with this bank donald trump was doing business
[2:37:21.680 --> 2:37:29.120]  with this russian oil firm uh no it was actually hunter biden with the bank accounts with the
[2:37:29.120 --> 2:37:34.880]  russian oil firms with the mayor of moscow caught human trafficking that's the biden's
[2:37:37.120 --> 2:37:44.320]  so there it is just yet again every dang time every single freaking time man
[2:37:44.320 --> 2:37:58.160]  all right let's do this this is an odd one here donald trump bed mister golf course
[2:37:58.160 --> 2:38:06.320]  hosts the hosts the live golf tour and there's a bunch of kerfuffle about this right now the
[2:38:06.320 --> 2:38:14.480]  saudi arabians basically buying professional golf and all these golfers are going over there
[2:38:14.480 --> 2:38:21.280]  because they make a lot more money and basically the live golf tour has come up so fast now it's
[2:38:21.280 --> 2:38:27.280]  competitive with the top professional golf tour in the world for years the pga and so trump has the
[2:38:27.280 --> 2:38:32.240]  live event at his golf course and by the way it these live events seem to be like the most fun
[2:38:32.240 --> 2:38:37.280]  events everybody's loving it they embrace tradition they embrace american culture and freedom and
[2:38:37.280 --> 2:38:40.240]  everything you don't really get that as much as the pga they got to be a little more politically
[2:38:40.240 --> 2:38:46.560]  correct after all so there's these trump chance that break out four more years chance that break
[2:38:46.560 --> 2:38:52.800]  out f joe biden chance let's go by brandon chance tucker carlson shows up marjorie taylor green
[2:38:52.800 --> 2:38:56.480]  shows up i think maybe even matt gates main appearance trump's driving around giving funny
[2:38:56.480 --> 2:39:03.040]  comments to the media and this just enrages liberals i'm telling you folks i'm telling you
[2:39:03.040 --> 2:39:09.280]  and you know i i try to be a little more you know info wars has to be the voice of urgency
[2:39:09.280 --> 2:39:14.800]  in all this we just have to be as the people that hit the front lines and hit the barbed wire first
[2:39:14.800 --> 2:39:19.600]  we have to be the voice of urgency and that's legitimate that's that's real but see i i i
[2:39:19.600 --> 2:39:24.160]  realized something and this is why a lot of times i like to back off and chill out and and relax
[2:39:24.160 --> 2:39:29.440]  the democrats and the liberal left hate more than anything else you having fun
[2:39:30.480 --> 2:39:35.440]  the democrats and the liberal left hate more than anything else you enjoying life
[2:39:35.440 --> 2:39:39.840]  that is their ultimate pet peeve when they see americans enjoying life when they see
[2:39:39.840 --> 2:39:45.840]  conservatives and christians enjoying life it boils their insides like you can't even imagine
[2:39:46.880 --> 2:39:50.400]  and yeah that's what you get that's video compilation you have on the screen right now
[2:39:50.400 --> 2:39:55.280]  do you want to know why liberals are so angry and raging all the time because they hate seeing
[2:39:55.280 --> 2:40:00.480]  you enjoy life they hate life they're miserable they want you to be miserable with them so when
[2:40:00.480 --> 2:40:06.000]  they see donald trump and tucker carlson and margie taylor green and a giant golf tour having fun
[2:40:06.000 --> 2:40:14.560]  having drinks having fun chance having laughs they are enraged so a lot of times i just like
[2:40:14.560 --> 2:40:19.200]  to back off and say hey you know what let's have some fun we're all on this planet together we're
[2:40:19.200 --> 2:40:26.720]  all in this crazy world together there's a lot bigger things than us out here sure we like life
[2:40:26.720 --> 2:40:30.800]  we like freedom we like prosperity we're going to battle politically to ensure all that
[2:40:31.360 --> 2:40:39.760]  against the democrat plan to destroy us but so now all the sudden funded by both republicans
[2:40:39.760 --> 2:40:46.720]  and democrats they're running anti-trump ads because he has the saudi arabian golf tour at
[2:40:46.720 --> 2:40:52.640]  his golf course so now this ad is going around television all the sudden saudi arabia's involvement
[2:40:52.640 --> 2:40:58.480]  in 9 11 is a big issue to our establishment and to democrats and republicans they never
[2:40:58.480 --> 2:41:04.320]  seemed to care before but now they're running this ad against donald trump in clip 27 there's
[2:41:04.320 --> 2:41:10.320]  a murder on 9 11 i live every single day without my father fb i files show the saudi government
[2:41:10.320 --> 2:41:15.600]  was involved this golf tournament is taking place 50 miles from ground zero it's disgusting
[2:41:15.600 --> 2:41:21.840]  worse than a slap in the face you're taking money from an evil regime these are 3000 americans that
[2:41:21.840 --> 2:41:27.520]  were killed on american soil how much money to turn you back on your own country 200 million sure
[2:41:27.520 --> 2:41:32.400]  i'll forget about the atrocities i'm never gonna forget never gonna forgive the golfers for taking
[2:41:32.400 --> 2:41:40.560]  this blood money so that's a 9 11 justice thing uh that's sadly now being used as a political weapon
[2:41:40.560 --> 2:41:47.040]  against donald trump really sad but oh when it came out that it was saudi arabians i mean who
[2:41:47.040 --> 2:41:52.080]  knows the truth about 9 11 i mean you know 10 passports or whatever 10 ids of saudi arabians
[2:41:52.080 --> 2:41:57.040]  on top of a mountain of rubble and molten lava perfectly preserved for the investigations to
[2:41:57.040 --> 2:42:02.080]  take place if you believe that okay so they say saudi arabians did it saudi arabian government
[2:42:02.080 --> 2:42:10.720]  do it but now it's a golf tournament more than 20 years afterwards and that's what you're upset about
[2:42:10.720 --> 2:42:16.000]  not the weapons that we've been sending to saudi arabia for years not the deals that we've been
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:20.720]  cutting with saudi arabia for years democrats and republicans both not the saudi arabians
[2:42:21.280 --> 2:42:28.320]  destroying yemen with the weapons that we give them no no no no no no no none of that's a problem
[2:42:28.320 --> 2:42:36.080]  now that donald trump has a golf tournament donald trump has a golf tournament at his course
[2:42:36.080 --> 2:42:42.640]  from a saudi arabian golf league and now the now all the sudden saudi arabia's involvement in 9
[2:42:42.640 --> 2:42:47.840]  11 is a big deal and now we're gonna run national ads about it to demonize donald trump these people
[2:42:47.840 --> 2:42:53.840]  are such phonies it just makes me sick i can't wait till we rid ourselves of these phonies the
[2:42:53.840 --> 2:42:58.560]  world is going to be such a better place oh my gosh info wars has been vindicated we've been proven

[2:47:24.160 --> 2:47:29.360]  i'm seeing more videos than ever and i'm getting these messages from people that work in agriculture
[2:47:29.360 --> 2:47:37.840]  and farming saying hey our price to pay uh here is is quadrupling since biden got in and those
[2:47:37.840 --> 2:47:42.960]  prices have not really hit the market yet food prices are still expected to double in the next
[2:47:42.960 --> 2:47:52.400]  year and that's just what's going to be available on the shelves so we've warned about this we saw
[2:47:52.400 --> 2:48:00.000]  the coming supply chain issues it's all part of a globalist world economic forum democrat agenda to
[2:48:00.000 --> 2:48:06.720]  starve you out and make you poor and then force you into the massive city civic center super
[2:48:07.360 --> 2:48:13.280]  cities like in judge dread and that'll be the only place where you get access to food or water
[2:48:13.280 --> 2:48:19.840]  or air conditioning or heat in the winter now we may not ever get to that dark place where the
[2:48:19.840 --> 2:48:24.320]  democrats and the globalist want to take us but that's the course we're on right now so
[2:48:24.320 --> 2:48:28.640]  i suggest you go to prepare today dot com and prepare yourself folks get the emergency food
[2:48:28.640 --> 2:48:35.040]  supplies get the emergency water supplies get all the emergency supplies at prepare today dot com so
[2:48:35.040 --> 2:48:43.280]  if we reach that dark place you won't be forced to go in to these globalist ghetto dens in order to
[2:48:43.280 --> 2:48:47.360]  survive because that's going to be the last thing you want because that's going to lead to serfdom
[2:48:47.360 --> 2:48:54.320]  and slavery and that's where this globalist plan goes and then of course just depopulation by illegitimate
[2:48:54.320 --> 2:49:01.840]  rule too many humans on the planet you're consuming too much energy you just got to die but if you can
[2:49:01.840 --> 2:49:08.240]  be independent in this coming globalist democrat agenda then you might be able to survive it so
[2:49:08.240 --> 2:49:11.920]  let's hope it doesn't get there but in case it does you're going to want to have emergency food
[2:49:11.920 --> 2:49:21.760]  supplies go to prepare today dot com and get yourself prepared all right um quickly i am
[2:49:21.760 --> 2:49:27.280]  going to be hosting the war room coming up i i tend to take a lot of phone calls on the war room
[2:49:27.280 --> 2:49:32.160]  today we haven't taken too many phone calls this week so i'll be taking a lot of phone calls
[2:49:32.160 --> 2:49:39.760]  coming up on the war room another great video at band out video from badass uncle sam xl pipeline
[2:49:39.760 --> 2:49:47.040]  worker reveals how gun toting feds forced his team to abandon job site and how serious and
[2:49:47.040 --> 2:49:52.480]  scary it was that situation you can find that on badass uncle sam's channel and band out video and
[2:49:52.480 --> 2:50:00.880]  so here's the truth a lot of americans are suffering because of the inflation a lot of americans are
[2:50:00.880 --> 2:50:07.200]  suffering because their jobs have just been shut down or null nulled and void by our politicians
[2:50:07.200 --> 2:50:12.400]  by democrat party policy whether it's shutting down the oil sector uh energy sector or whether
[2:50:12.400 --> 2:50:19.280]  it's just all the covet madness that is that's never gonna go back to normal people are struggling
[2:50:19.280 --> 2:50:24.960]  but oh whoopee goberg she thinks she's got it out this is one of the dumbest people in the history
[2:50:24.960 --> 2:50:30.080]  of television she thinks she's got it all figured out why people are struggling struggling so much
[2:50:30.080 --> 2:50:36.880]  in clip 22 slam on young people but if you have worked your behind off you've tried to move yourself
[2:50:36.880 --> 2:50:42.000]  up the ladder you talk about people can't get gas they can't buy food they can't put their
[2:50:42.000 --> 2:50:47.200]  children through through any kind of college that's because they're paying off these freaking student
[2:50:47.200 --> 2:50:55.440]  debt so oh everything student loans everything is student loan debts that's the problem now folks
[2:50:55.440 --> 2:51:01.360]  as somebody who's who did have uh i mean right on the verge of six figure student loan debt
[2:51:02.640 --> 2:51:07.600]  they actually make these things extremely manageable i mean you can get you can be like
[2:51:07.600 --> 2:51:11.200]  a hundred thousand dollars in student loan debt and you can get it down to like paying
[2:51:12.160 --> 2:51:16.800]  less than a hundred bucks a month and you can even defer the payments as long as you want now
[2:51:17.360 --> 2:51:21.760]  the whole thing is a scam don't get me wrong college degrees about 90 percent of them are
[2:51:21.760 --> 2:51:29.200]  totally worthless the entire university system now is 90 percent just indoctrination um
[2:51:30.720 --> 2:51:36.800]  but to sit here and act like college student loan debt is the reason why people are struggling in
[2:51:36.800 --> 2:51:43.440]  the economy is absurd and again it just shows how out of touch with reality will be goldberg is
[2:51:43.440 --> 2:51:48.880]  i'm not sure she's ever had to take on that show that's grounded in reality at all everybody knows
[2:51:48.880 --> 2:51:53.760]  again it's being in student loan debt sucks don't get me wrong but you can defer them you can get
[2:51:53.760 --> 2:51:58.800]  your payments down as low as possible it's not student loan debt that is crushing this country
[2:51:59.680 --> 2:52:05.440]  economically it's not even on the radar map but notice what she mentioned before she blamed it on
[2:52:05.440 --> 2:52:11.280]  student loan debt she said food prices going up energy prices going up gas prices going up
[2:52:11.280 --> 2:52:18.960]  oh well what's that the result of democrat party policy that liberals like whoopie goldberg vote for
[2:52:18.960 --> 2:52:21.840]  by the way do you think whoopie goldberg ever had to worry about student loan debt you think any
[2:52:21.840 --> 2:52:24.960]  of whoopie goldberg's family if she has it would love her up to worry about student loan debt of
[2:52:24.960 --> 2:52:30.640]  course not she's got millions of dollars but she's going to tell you why you're struggling financially
[2:52:31.680 --> 2:52:37.360]  as she votes for all the policies that cause you to struggle financially and then goes on tv
[2:52:37.360 --> 2:52:42.720]  like the arrogant bimbo that she is pretending like she cares about you pretending like she has
[2:52:42.720 --> 2:52:47.840]  any clue what's going on in your life it's really pathetic that the view is still on television
[2:52:47.840 --> 2:52:54.640]  isn't it that show should have been canceled years ago i you know i just can't get off of this it's
[2:52:54.640 --> 2:53:05.440]  just it's stuck in my crawl now i just you know i the thing that separates info wars from everybody
[2:53:05.440 --> 2:53:13.600]  else and and i don't know if it's the actual ability to have foresight accurately like a great chess
[2:53:13.600 --> 2:53:19.440]  player would have but but in the political realm or as it's just that we're willing to go there
[2:53:19.440 --> 2:53:24.560]  we're willing to open those gateways in our mind and we're willing to broadcast what we find here
[2:53:24.560 --> 2:53:31.840]  on the air so just like info wars sadly has predicted all the bad things that have happened
[2:53:31.840 --> 2:53:38.080]  and because of democrat policy republican policy globalist policy world economic forum build back
[2:53:38.080 --> 2:53:43.600]  better great reset policy just like we've been able to predict all the bad things that would come of
[2:53:43.600 --> 2:53:48.640]  that it's easy enough it's just a cause and effect but we can have that foresight we can broadcast
[2:53:48.640 --> 2:53:56.000]  that knowing that that what the plans are i can do the same thing with with good like i can see
[2:53:56.000 --> 2:54:01.280]  how the world can get it be a better place just like that just like we can see all the things
[2:54:01.280 --> 2:54:05.440]  that are causing america to become a worse place just like we can see all the things that are
[2:54:05.440 --> 2:54:09.360]  causing the world to become a worse place i can see all the things that would cause the world to
[2:54:09.360 --> 2:54:15.920]  be a better place and it's that's what's so frustrating in my head and and maybe there needs
[2:54:15.920 --> 2:54:25.840]  to be a change of operational thought process in my head where we've already shown you all the bad
[2:54:25.840 --> 2:54:29.280]  things we've already shown you what's going to happen we've already shown you where it's all going
[2:54:29.280 --> 2:54:35.440]  maybe we change our vision of foresight to the good of the future the potential good of the future
[2:54:35.440 --> 2:54:39.520]  and instead of the potential bad that we've already now experienced i mean we're living in the alex
[2:54:39.520 --> 2:54:43.440]  jones world we're living in the new world order we're living in everything alex jones said coming
[2:54:43.440 --> 2:54:51.200]  true now uh that's why he's battling for his life right now see how that works but see i can see what
[2:54:51.200 --> 2:54:55.840]  could be happened i could see what could happen that would cause things to be better you get the
[2:54:55.840 --> 2:55:01.600]  view off of television indoctrinating women that watch it every day do you have any idea how much
[2:55:01.600 --> 2:55:06.720]  better this country would be that's just that's just like a fraction of a fraction of the good
[2:55:09.200 --> 2:55:14.240]  if the if people in america understood the true history of the democrat party if people in america
[2:55:14.240 --> 2:55:18.480]  understood the true policies of the democrat party they would not vote for them anymore
[2:55:18.480 --> 2:55:28.720]  if people understood that tuning into the view you're getting a sewer rot of intellect they wouldn't
[2:55:28.720 --> 2:55:33.680]  tune in they wouldn't have any influence if people knew that cnn and msnbc and all these people were
[2:55:33.680 --> 2:55:38.960]  literally fake news they wouldn't tune in they wouldn't have that influence and the world would
[2:55:38.960 --> 2:55:43.520]  actually be a better place and that's what's so frustrating and i was talking about this to alex
[2:55:43.520 --> 2:55:52.480]  stein last night how we can get along with liberals even if they hate our guts we can
[2:55:52.480 --> 2:55:56.880]  disagree vehemently and at the end of the day still want to break bread and and accept that
[2:55:56.880 --> 2:56:01.760]  we're still all humans on this planet sharing this experience together they don't have that same
[2:56:01.760 --> 2:56:11.200]  sentiment they hate you they want you dead and gone but see that's what's so frustrating is
[2:56:11.200 --> 2:56:16.320]  is i just realized that it's their policies that are destroying us i just realized that if their
[2:56:16.320 --> 2:56:23.600]  ideology that's in the way and if we got rid of it it wouldn't be a problem common sense stuff
[2:56:25.360 --> 2:56:31.520]  like lowering taxes common sense stuff like having a border common sense stuff like going
[2:56:31.520 --> 2:56:36.720]  after real criminals and making sure that they can't get back out to commit violent crimes again
[2:56:36.720 --> 2:56:42.160]  common sense stuff like a good guy with a gun stops the bad guy with a gun
[2:56:43.200 --> 2:56:50.560]  common sense stuff that the liberal american democrat left has completely removed from the
[2:56:50.560 --> 2:56:57.440]  conversation and demonized as an ideology all common sense stuff the democrats destroying
[2:56:57.440 --> 2:57:04.960]  the nuclear family the democrats destroying the major inner cities and i just can see the world
[2:57:04.960 --> 2:57:10.720]  without any of it i can see america without any of it i can see the world and america without
[2:57:10.720 --> 2:57:16.960]  any more democrat policy without any more liberal influence and i mean folks it's the most prosperous
[2:57:16.960 --> 2:57:21.920]  society that you've ever imagined will actually have innovation will actually have new engineering
[2:57:21.920 --> 2:57:27.200]  will actually have new sources of energy will actually lower the poverty rates lower the crime
[2:57:27.200 --> 2:57:31.920]  rates all of it and it's just these damn democrats and these damn liberals and these damn globalists
[2:57:31.920 --> 2:57:38.240]  standing in our way because they hate you i don't have hate for them i want us all to experience
[2:57:38.240 --> 2:57:42.240]  what the world can be but they're sitting there like the little devils minions that they are

[3:00:55.040 --> 3:00:59.200]  more people are figuring that out now quickly what did i tell you in the last segment about
[3:00:59.840 --> 3:01:06.960]  the death cult known as liberal democrats here is ari fleischer on fox news and and this is true
[3:01:06.960 --> 3:01:13.120]  this is what the left is banking on a total death cult and a commitment to people to believe in their
[3:01:13.120 --> 3:01:17.760]  death cult to drink the jim jones kool-aid here it is from ari fleischer especially during the
[3:01:17.760 --> 3:01:24.240]  august recess but that's also going to mean that that republican senators will will have to use
[3:01:24.240 --> 3:01:30.320]  parliamentary maneuvers to keep this thing afloat through the vacation i hope they do that
[3:01:32.400 --> 3:01:36.960]  yeah i i don't see how this is a political winner for the democrats unless they're counting on the
[3:01:36.960 --> 3:01:41.280]  left wing base of the democrat party that just thinks the world's going to end in 12 years
[3:01:41.280 --> 3:01:47.040]  or now i guess we're down to 10 or 8 for them to no longer sit on their hands and get out to vote
[3:01:47.040 --> 3:01:50.480]  because of all the hundreds of billions of subsidies that are going to cause is that
[3:01:50.480 --> 3:01:55.520]  i suppose they support but the bigger damage too is this bill really should be named the
[3:01:55.520 --> 3:02:01.920]  raised taxes and pushed the economy deeper into recession act i have never in my entire career heard
[3:02:01.920 --> 3:02:06.960]  of somebody who thinks it's good public policy to raise taxes here as the nation is entering a
[3:02:06.960 --> 3:02:12.080]  recession that prolongs recessions that doesn't stimulate the economy that doesn't give you the
[3:02:12.080 --> 3:02:18.160]  help that you need it makes things worse and why for really what's essentially corporate welfare
[3:02:18.160 --> 3:02:24.480]  this is a gigantic spending bill to give money to green corporate welfare and that's what so much
[3:02:24.480 --> 3:02:29.360]  of the green industry has grown up into without subsidies they would never be competitive would
[3:02:29.360 --> 3:02:33.440]  never exist and the more subsidies you give them the more they're just hooked on government
[3:02:33.440 --> 3:02:38.560]  and that's what this bill does and joe and look the proof is in the pudding here because
[3:02:39.200 --> 3:02:43.200]  if liberals and democrats really believe the nonsense they pushed about man made global
[3:02:43.200 --> 3:02:49.680]  warming or climate change or ice age or whatever is there promoting the latest phenomenon of the lie
[3:02:51.120 --> 3:02:56.160]  they never live by what they claim they still drive cars they still fly on planes they still
[3:02:56.160 --> 3:03:00.800]  have air conditioning in their 10 mansions they don't they don't live any of the things they believe
[3:03:00.800 --> 3:03:06.640]  they'd go live in caves they'd be living out on the lake on a river on a creek but no they're not
[3:03:06.640 --> 3:03:12.320]  because they know it's all a lie they just want to scare you into giving over your freedom they
[3:03:12.320 --> 3:03:18.720]  just want to scare you into giving over your future your fortune your wealth they want to control
[3:03:19.600 --> 3:03:24.560]  you but that's what it is they have to convince everybody that the planet is going to end in
[3:03:24.560 --> 3:03:31.280]  12 years and then use that fear to control you and then just kind of put it in another way
[3:03:33.600 --> 3:03:39.280]  you know they keep saying they need our money to fight global warming they keep saying they need
[3:03:39.280 --> 3:03:46.160]  our money to do all this stuff they want to raise taxes and meanwhile they just give all this money
[3:03:46.160 --> 3:03:52.400]  to ukraine so they've pretty much admitted that the dollar is fake they've pretty much admitted
[3:03:52.400 --> 3:03:58.000]  the dollar has no value actually at all and they can just print it out of thin air so then tell me
[3:03:58.000 --> 3:04:06.400]  why are you still paying taxes why are they still asking you to give them money to stop climate
[3:04:06.400 --> 3:04:11.280]  change if the world is going to end in 12 years or eight years or wherever we're at and they can
[3:04:11.280 --> 3:04:16.800]  just send endless gobs of money to ukraine why are they coming at us for money they admit the
[3:04:16.800 --> 3:04:24.080]  dollar has no value they print money at will they say the world is ending in eight years so go live
[3:04:24.080 --> 3:04:32.000]  in a hut and then print 20 billion dollars and stop asking us for money but see because it's all
[3:04:32.000 --> 3:04:36.320]  alive folks it's all about controlling your life and making you a slave in the name of manmade
[3:04:36.320 --> 3:04:41.120]  climate change i'll be back hosting the war room in an hour taking your phone calls kate dally

[3:04:56.720 --> 3:05:02.240]  the globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family to destroy heterosexual

[3:05:08.000 --> 3:05:15.280]  of marital splits is that there's problems in the bedroom and the number one issue men have is a
[3:05:15.280 --> 3:05:20.640]  rectile dysfunction ladies and gentlemen the left makes big jokes about this because they don't want
[3:05:20.640 --> 3:05:26.240]  people having lasting good loving relationships they want to break up society and we are so excited

[3:06:47.680 --> 3:06:54.480]  why an opening ceremony i guess i'll call it a ceremony an opening ceremony just full of
[3:06:54.480 --> 3:07:02.640]  weirdness uh like the worship of bail like the calf or the bowl with the huge horns and the red
[3:07:02.640 --> 3:07:11.200]  blood eyes and and the audience members dancing around this thing like like they could not wait
[3:07:11.200 --> 3:07:18.080]  to show this thing off this thing's huge huge and what do the bbc commentators say it's full of
[3:07:18.080 --> 3:07:24.800]  light it's a symbol of free oh my gosh a symbol of free i don't even know what to say to this
[3:07:25.600 --> 3:07:31.760]  except that we're in this time right now and we're not even noticing what is going on these
[3:07:31.760 --> 3:07:40.000]  people are on the ground dancing and and bowing and making these horn signs to the to the bull i'm
[3:07:40.000 --> 3:07:46.000]  sorry what does this have to do with sports what what in the world and they've got this so they got
[3:07:46.000 --> 3:07:52.400]  this giant bull blood filled eyes you know chained and and and it's so i don't even know the word
[3:07:52.400 --> 3:07:57.840]  for it i all i know is i like a little bail you know when i'm watching a good old game a london
[3:07:57.840 --> 3:08:05.840]  squash want to want a little lucifer worship with my summer games when did our sports events become
[3:08:05.840 --> 3:08:11.040]  this that's what i want to know because uh i don't know what they're going to do at the paris games
[3:08:11.040 --> 3:08:16.080]  are the paris games of 2024 we're going to do a real human sacrifice and call it good and everyone's
[3:08:16.080 --> 3:08:21.600]  going to dance around and act like this is a symbol of light too i i don't know this is nuts the
[3:08:21.600 --> 3:08:26.640]  commonwealth games are referred to as the friendly games okay and these friendly games are like this
[3:08:26.640 --> 3:08:34.960]  multi sport event so prince charles kicked off this this fun thing and and of course bail what was
[3:08:34.960 --> 3:08:41.120]  bail you know if you read the old testament the canaanite god and of course uh why why did why
[3:08:41.120 --> 3:08:47.040]  did we do that well creating idols and participating a lot of sexual immorality and sacrificing the
[3:08:47.040 --> 3:08:53.520]  children you know the stuff we're doing now anyway at the 2012 olympics i don't know if you guys
[3:08:53.520 --> 3:08:59.200]  remember but it was the hospital beds the green the grim reaper you know was that uh was that
[3:08:59.200 --> 3:09:04.720]  foretelling or what did they know that was coming or what but also i just wanted to mention that
[3:09:04.720 --> 3:09:10.320]  we've had these different games and i don't know if we're just the frog in the perpetual boiling
[3:09:10.320 --> 3:09:17.360]  boiling water or what but something's wrong when we do not even notice what we're doing it has
[3:09:17.360 --> 3:09:22.640]  nothing to do with sports give me a break what does it have to do with anything that we're playing
[3:09:22.640 --> 3:09:28.400]  but i i i'm gonna i'm gonna wager with you guys that when we get to the 2024 olympics
[3:09:28.400 --> 3:09:33.040]  it's gonna be bad it's gonna be the opening the opening ceremony everybody talks about
[3:09:33.040 --> 3:09:37.280]  because i'll bet you they do some things very similar to this but you know it's interesting
[3:09:37.280 --> 3:09:42.160]  as we're watching this play out and all these these these little sheeple they're dancing and
[3:09:42.160 --> 3:09:47.360]  acting like it's the best thing they've ever seen what i what i was thinking was the bbc was
[3:09:47.360 --> 3:09:52.640]  sitting there saying this is a symbol of light a symbol of freedom and i sat there and thought
[3:09:53.280 --> 3:10:00.320]  this is how they do this all the time every false flag everything what you're seeing on the screen
[3:10:00.320 --> 3:10:05.520]  well it's not what you're really seeing we're going to tell you what you're seeing right with
[3:10:05.520 --> 3:10:11.040]  everything everything i've even brought up on this show it's basically we're here to give you this
[3:10:11.040 --> 3:10:16.160]  auditory response as you're watching these things and we're going to continue to say it
[3:10:16.160 --> 3:10:22.240]  it and continue to say it and continue to say it until you believe what we say and not what's
[3:10:22.240 --> 3:10:29.280]  right before your eyes so the election fraud it was right before our eyes we all saw it right
[3:10:30.160 --> 3:10:35.440]  but then they wanted to tell you you did not see it you didn't see it don't bring it up you're not
[3:10:35.440 --> 3:10:41.280]  allowed to talk about it in america right now you're just not and no politician will discuss it
[3:10:41.280 --> 3:10:47.200]  no one will even say a word and why because it goes all the way down to the city races a county
[3:10:47.200 --> 3:10:53.600]  races state races that's why that's why they don't want all of their races known and so they don't
[3:10:53.600 --> 3:10:57.840]  want to they don't want to look and see and one thing i will tell you about the election fraud
[3:10:57.840 --> 3:11:03.760]  that's going on right now in every county mine included is the numbers are way up of turnout
[3:11:03.760 --> 3:11:11.840]  so where turnout in my community was 26 on an election year right like 2016 2020 right on an
[3:11:11.840 --> 3:11:16.160]  election year that's when it's the highest out of all four years everybody kind of comes out of
[3:11:16.160 --> 3:11:22.960]  their closet in their basement you know to vote okay to do their duty but here's the deal usually
[3:11:22.960 --> 3:11:28.000]  it's around 26 percent 25 percent and that's how it's always been it doesn't even matter what's
[3:11:28.000 --> 3:11:35.520]  going on in society this county here was up to 50 percent some counties 100 percent and here's a
[3:11:35.520 --> 3:11:40.880]  clue some counties 110 percent but you're not supposed to notice it you're not supposed to talk
[3:11:40.880 --> 3:11:45.920]  about it you're not supposed to see it you're not even supposed to ask why and here's another here's
[3:11:45.920 --> 3:11:51.760]  another hint for you if this was actually something that was occurring and we had this phenomenon
[3:11:51.760 --> 3:11:56.080]  going on because even if you go back to the beginning of this country we still only had
[3:11:56.080 --> 3:12:01.520]  about 25 percent because it was property owners okay so the numbers really haven't changed very
[3:12:01.520 --> 3:12:07.840]  much most people they're sheeple they just don't care okay but if we had something phenomenal
[3:12:07.840 --> 3:12:13.840]  going on like the 50 percent that we were told happened even in my own community well they would
[3:12:13.840 --> 3:12:18.640]  be shouting that from the rooftops giving themselves a bunch of high fives and saying oh my gosh
[3:12:18.640 --> 3:12:23.520]  we've made a history we've doubled the numbers not just up by a couple percentage points because
[3:12:23.520 --> 3:12:28.160]  people have piqued interest because we have king fraud a lot in hormon at the helm no
[3:12:28.160 --> 3:12:34.400]  because we're looking at across the board in america the all the rates are really really
[3:12:34.400 --> 3:12:39.680]  high this is how they get some fraud in besides for the software problems this is what they do for
[3:12:39.680 --> 3:12:45.440]  fraud they're actually padding the votes and making it look like they have these huge huge
[3:12:45.440 --> 3:12:51.440]  turnouts so in your county i challenge you to take those numbers go to your county commissioners
[3:12:51.440 --> 3:12:55.840]  whatever county you're in and say why are the numbers high because they're high all across the
[3:12:55.840 --> 3:13:02.320]  board and it isn't because people are waking up it's because we have a problem and this was in 2022
[3:13:02.320 --> 3:13:07.120]  all the numbers were high in the swing states it was like a hundred percent in the counties of the
[3:13:07.120 --> 3:13:14.400]  swing states a hundred percent show up even my dead grandma really a hundred percent wow
[3:13:14.400 --> 3:13:20.000]  that is the most phenomenal turnout don't believe it for a second don't believe it for a second so
[3:13:20.000 --> 3:13:26.080]  this is where the american people have to step in and now start voicing some of the problems and
[3:13:26.080 --> 3:13:31.840]  this is a problem that they're sort of padding over in the news oh yeah there was a 50% turnout
[3:13:31.840 --> 3:13:37.680]  don't look here anyway on with the article this is what they're doing they're trying to tell you
[3:13:37.680 --> 3:13:42.800]  don't look here totally normal we're not even going to specify that this is abnormal see what
[3:13:42.800 --> 3:13:47.760]  i mean this is how they're doing it so go to your county commissioners and say you know what we have
[3:13:47.760 --> 3:13:53.760]  a very very very big problem i also wanted to mention that the military is getting tricked uh the
[3:13:53.760 --> 3:13:59.840]  military they're ignoring the court system completely ignoring it right now and this is a warning you
[3:13:59.840 --> 3:14:03.440]  need to tell people about if you have friends and family in the military i have family in the
[3:14:03.440 --> 3:14:08.800]  military always have here's the deal they're ignoring the courts on the vaccine mandate even
[3:14:08.800 --> 3:14:13.600]  the court said you know sorry you can't do this what they're doing is they're saying okay well in
[3:14:13.600 --> 3:14:19.280]  30 days don't show up for work military member because if you don't have your shots and you don't
[3:14:19.280 --> 3:14:26.080]  have your your paperwork then we're going to get rid of you anyway and what it's doing is it's telling
[3:14:26.080 --> 3:14:32.400]  the servicemen don't show up just don't show that's the trick it's a don't show trick so then they
[3:14:32.400 --> 3:14:37.920]  can say they didn't show for work now you know we've got to they've gone AWOL now we're going to go
[3:14:37.920 --> 3:14:44.080]  ahead with proceedings and we're going to um we're going to charge this military member make sure
[3:14:44.080 --> 3:14:50.560]  that your military member friend or family keeps showing up for work and ignores what the military
[3:14:50.560 --> 3:14:55.440]  is telling them because the court's already cited the fact that the military is going against that
[3:14:55.440 --> 3:15:00.640]  says volumes to me and it should say volumes to you their numbers are very low people are not
[3:15:00.640 --> 3:15:06.080]  signing up like they used to but then again we also have to question why do we have a full-time
[3:15:06.080 --> 3:15:14.000]  military all the time in this kind of world with with what we have going on but also you know did
[3:15:14.000 --> 3:15:17.920]  the founders really envision that or did they envision an army that was trained but ready to go
[3:15:17.920 --> 3:15:23.360]  when when necessary it's a whole nother topic but i just wanted to let you guys know about the fraud
[3:15:23.360 --> 3:15:28.800]  going on and how they're telling military members not to show up so that they can condemn them to
[3:15:28.800 --> 3:15:34.640]  AWOL status and that's how they're getting rid of people so make sure your military member shows up
[3:15:34.640 --> 3:15:40.880]  for work shows up for work regardless of what they're saying about the vaccine mandate and with all
[3:15:40.880 --> 3:15:46.800]  the deaths coming in i know people are finally realizing that yes these shots are full of everything
[3:15:46.800 --> 3:15:53.520]  judy mykovitz said last week hiv leukemia it's a death shot be right back on the alex jones show

[3:20:14.960 --> 3:20:20.000]  kate dally radio dot com glad you're joining me and uh those supplements that alex is always
[3:20:20.000 --> 3:20:26.080]  talking about they're fantastic get extra get extra right now why so while supply chains are working
[3:20:26.080 --> 3:20:30.800]  that's my biggest advice to people right now get ahead on some antibiotics get ahead on some
[3:20:30.800 --> 3:20:35.280]  supplements the more supplements the better let's get away from pharma as much as we can but wow
[3:20:35.280 --> 3:20:41.440]  we really need to stock up right now i'm talking about bail worship in the last segment i just
[3:20:41.440 --> 3:20:48.480]  wanted to to remind you guys you guys remember 2016 new york when the the 50 foot replica of bail
[3:20:48.480 --> 3:20:53.840]  went went on international tour and landed of course in new york in new york of course it
[3:20:53.840 --> 3:20:59.760]  lands in new york because where else would it go and uh i just remember i remember doing a show on
[3:20:59.760 --> 3:21:06.320]  it and thinking are we really here this is good we have a real problem recognizing the time that
[3:21:06.320 --> 3:21:11.040]  we're in and i think a lot of us just want to just get through life and and you know have our
[3:21:11.040 --> 3:21:16.560]  kids and go to work and it's stress enough just worrying about everything you have to worry about
[3:21:16.560 --> 3:21:22.400]  and making the bills let alone figuring out where we're at with our society right now it's kind of
[3:21:22.400 --> 3:21:28.000]  scary but uh i just i wanted to bring this up because i really actually am a fan of reagan always
[3:21:28.000 --> 3:21:33.360]  was a fan of reagan um but and i'm not really poking at reagan i'm just poking at what he's saying
[3:21:33.360 --> 3:21:38.160]  and you know there's a clip that keeps going around and i think ted cruz even put it out on
[3:21:38.160 --> 3:21:43.760]  a meme and it said basically you know a recession is when you lose your job and of course a depression
[3:21:43.760 --> 3:21:48.720]  is when our recessions when your neighbor loses a job depression is when you lose your job and of
[3:21:48.720 --> 3:21:54.320]  course jimmy carter needs to lose his job that's recovery okay so they have been um posting this
[3:21:54.320 --> 3:21:58.880]  everywhere and i've been seeing this but the other part of the speech is what bothered me and i wanted
[3:21:58.880 --> 3:22:03.680]  to bring this up because it's a really great lesson and a lesson that we seem to go along with but
[3:22:03.680 --> 3:22:09.200]  we never ever talk about we don't we don't realize the truth about this lesson in his speech that he
[3:22:09.200 --> 3:22:15.360]  gave that day he said now he was talking about us and he said they helped to build the magnificent
[3:22:15.360 --> 3:22:20.000]  city across the river our forebears okay they spread across the land building other cities
[3:22:20.000 --> 3:22:26.320]  and other towns and incredibly productive farms they came to make america work uh they didn't
[3:22:26.320 --> 3:22:30.800]  ask what the country could do for them but what they could do to make this the refuge the greatest
[3:22:30.800 --> 3:22:38.640]  home of freedom in history but then he said then he said his answered all this misery he tried he's
[3:22:38.640 --> 3:22:43.600]  talking about jimmy carter his answered all this misery he tries to tell us we're only in a recession
[3:22:43.600 --> 3:22:49.520]  not a depression um as if definitions words relieve our suffering that's true but then he
[3:22:49.520 --> 3:22:54.720]  said this let it show on the record that when the american people cried out for economic help
[3:22:54.720 --> 3:22:58.880]  jimmy carter took refuge in a dictionary now you really could look at that and you could
[3:22:58.880 --> 3:23:02.160]  look at king fraud a lot you could say we're doing the same thing right now and we're kind of
[3:23:02.160 --> 3:23:07.600]  along the same lines but i brought this up because when he said let it show on record that the people
[3:23:07.600 --> 3:23:13.680]  cried out for economic help we were never supposed to get economic help from our government we were
[3:23:13.680 --> 3:23:19.280]  never supposed to be crying out for anything and what that speech did was it sort of reinserted
[3:23:19.280 --> 3:23:29.840]  this wrong belief that we as as members of a free capitalist system were supposed to be able to
[3:23:30.480 --> 3:23:35.440]  strengthen that and not have government compete with us like in you know the yellow pages test
[3:23:35.440 --> 3:23:40.000]  when you can go into the yellow pages and if government has an entity that does it then
[3:23:40.000 --> 3:23:45.120]  if you find it in the yellow pages you shouldn't be doing it too for government well the problem is
[3:23:45.120 --> 3:23:52.000]  is that we have been trained seriously trained to think that our government are the ones that we go
[3:23:52.000 --> 3:23:58.640]  to for economic help that the president controls the economy he doesn't and he shouldn't and it
[3:23:58.640 --> 3:24:02.800]  should not be this way and so that's why i've always brought up you know what about the states
[3:24:02.800 --> 3:24:07.040]  why aren't the states controlling their oil you know within their states why are we always
[3:24:07.040 --> 3:24:13.600]  looking to the feds when i was at freedom fest i interviewed a multi-billionaire okay and of
[3:24:13.600 --> 3:24:20.240]  course he even reiterated the line about well the feds are in charge of gas and what that's the feds
[3:24:20.240 --> 3:24:24.800]  no it's not it's not the feds it should be the states should be sovereign states but we should
[3:24:24.800 --> 3:24:29.520]  never be crying out to our government for help i also wanted to bring up because we're talking
[3:24:29.520 --> 3:24:36.320]  about presidents um you know this this election and what's happening right now and ever since 2016
[3:24:36.320 --> 3:24:42.160]  it was kind of a weird turn of events was it wasn't it and so when we looked at hillary i remember
[3:24:42.160 --> 3:24:46.560]  the saying she didn't think she would lose and i remember thinking something's really wrong with
[3:24:46.560 --> 3:24:52.000]  that statement because the presidencies have been controlled for about 120 years started with
[3:24:52.000 --> 3:24:58.160]  kernel house and behind the scenes pulling the little puppet strings and so a few got through
[3:24:58.800 --> 3:25:05.760]  but they've always managed to get in the chosen candidate from one of the parties team a team b
[3:25:05.760 --> 3:25:10.720]  and when one party you know when one side gets a little upset then they throw in the other team
[3:25:10.720 --> 3:25:17.520]  so to them to those that really run things it's team a team b and so what if the whole
[3:25:18.800 --> 3:25:26.640]  faked election fraudulent election was sincerely faked what if the whole thing was faked and we
[3:25:26.640 --> 3:25:32.640]  brought this up i think gosh years ago um when um when trump got into office but then i really
[3:25:32.640 --> 3:25:36.880]  actually started really liking trump and i really started liking what he was doing and you i thought
[3:25:36.880 --> 3:25:42.000]  he was doing what he could in a very corrupt system which we know that if the president exercises
[3:25:42.000 --> 3:25:47.600]  more authority than he has then that's not okay either it's always in congress's lap right but
[3:25:48.160 --> 3:25:53.040]  congress doesn't want you to look there so all eyes are always on the president of the united
[3:25:53.040 --> 3:26:00.800]  states now we have feeble what a joke king fraud a lot and hormala at the helm miss uh she and her
[3:26:00.800 --> 3:26:05.600]  and i'm wearing a blue dress this is who we have at the helm but maybe they wanted it this way
[3:26:05.600 --> 3:26:11.840]  maybe this was supposed to happen maybe as they swing us from the the right to the left to the
[3:26:11.840 --> 3:26:17.760]  right to the left you know we spent eight years with clinton then we spent eight years with bush
[3:26:17.760 --> 3:26:24.080]  and a lot of bad stuff happened under bush and then they gear us to accept obama half black
[3:26:24.080 --> 3:26:31.040]  president with no past um and no birth certificate really i mean let's be honest and uh and of course
[3:26:31.040 --> 3:26:35.440]  they brought him in as a moderate said he would get rid of the nsa but he didn't and he wasn't
[3:26:35.440 --> 3:26:40.880]  going to and he only strengthened it and so you saw all these things happen and people are sort of
[3:26:40.880 --> 3:26:45.360]  geared or like cattle and cattle guards you know we're sort of geared to the right and then to the
[3:26:45.360 --> 3:26:51.120]  left do you guys remember when the tea party was at its helm and who did they stick in newt gingrich
[3:26:51.120 --> 3:26:56.320]  newt gingrich was sort of like the fall guy he was supposed to go in and basically squash the tea
[3:26:56.320 --> 3:27:02.880]  party most people don't realize that but uh but if you really examine history you'll notice that
[3:27:02.880 --> 3:27:08.800]  whenever people started to rise up there was always somebody there at the helm as a leader to squash it
[3:27:09.520 --> 3:27:14.720]  and so they knew that we would probably see right what was right before our eyes and election fraud
[3:27:14.720 --> 3:27:19.360]  and be very upset because this was the most visible representation of it this was a in your
[3:27:19.360 --> 3:27:26.080]  face citizen representation and so you know was it always supposed to go like this is this why
[3:27:26.080 --> 3:27:31.360]  nothing's really happened is this why politicians are silent was it what is everybody playing their
[3:27:31.360 --> 3:27:37.840]  part and is it gearing us more to the right so that again we get squashed because what was the
[3:27:37.840 --> 3:27:42.880]  message of january 6 the whole fraudulent thing that happened at january 6 courtesy of our fbi
[3:27:43.440 --> 3:27:50.640]  it was don't protest don't go anywhere don't go anywhere don't do anything just be worried and
[3:27:50.640 --> 3:27:55.360]  sit in your home and sit in your recliner that was the message otherwise we'll ruin your life
[3:27:55.360 --> 3:28:00.800]  fraudulently and give you trumped up charges and so people are afraid to speak out they're
[3:28:00.800 --> 3:28:05.440]  afraid they're afraid of being targeted but what if that was the whole point what if the whole
[3:28:05.440 --> 3:28:11.040]  entire thing was spanked and everybody played a part what if hillary was actually supposed to win
[3:28:11.840 --> 3:28:15.360]  and they actually thought trump was their guy and they'd get him in and have him do the things
[3:28:15.360 --> 3:28:20.160]  they wanted him to do what if he actually did have a change of heart see there's lots of theories
[3:28:20.160 --> 3:28:26.720]  behind this and i always leave room for a miracle for somebody to change and for somebody to kind of
[3:28:26.720 --> 3:28:32.320]  take on something new and i did feel like that got done but it's kind of interesting when you look
[3:28:32.320 --> 3:28:39.280]  at all the different theories behind how big of a truman show are we actually in just thought i would
[3:28:39.280 --> 3:28:42.720]  say that just to kind of get the wheels turning and i know you probably already thought of this
[3:28:43.440 --> 3:28:49.440]  but now now that we're in 2022 maybe this is a really good time to sort of reflect on the last
[3:28:49.440 --> 3:28:57.360]  120 years the presidencies are always bought be right back i'm k dally the globalist great reset

[3:33:37.920 --> 3:33:43.600]  doing over there watering flowers or they ignited the match whatever we're still in the situation
[3:33:43.600 --> 3:33:47.760]  together and i do believe in you i believe in the american people i really do all you have to do is
[3:33:47.760 --> 3:33:53.120]  travel around the united states just don't go into your major cities um but if you travel around the
[3:33:53.120 --> 3:33:59.760]  united states it's a beautiful a beautiful place with really really great people and i also wanted
[3:33:59.760 --> 3:34:05.760]  to say this about is the whole thing faked right because if you haven't thought of that you know
[3:34:05.760 --> 3:34:10.640]  maybe we're too steeped into tribe mentality and that's exactly where they want us they want us
[3:34:10.640 --> 3:34:18.560]  arguing they want us fighting over over what biden said today or hormala or whatever and you know
[3:34:18.560 --> 3:34:22.720]  when they when they show them on camera see this is one thing that really got to me when they show
[3:34:22.720 --> 3:34:27.520]  them constantly saying those things you know they're they're showing the missteps all the time they
[3:34:27.520 --> 3:34:33.280]  want you to see the missteps they want you to see that he has dementia they want you to see he can't
[3:34:33.280 --> 3:34:39.840]  read a teleprompter they want you to know what a buffoon um hoary lady that kamala is they don't
[3:34:39.840 --> 3:34:46.000]  even like her who do they send over to taiwan nancy no one even wants nancy but she was the best of the
[3:34:46.000 --> 3:34:53.040]  litter i guess and kind of reminds me of aoc's race when they interviewed 10 000 people and aoc
[3:34:53.040 --> 3:34:59.360]  for for the job the theater production of congresswoman and they picked her this is all on on video
[3:34:59.360 --> 3:35:04.880]  you can see this they picked her because she was the best and the brightest yeah aoc anyway can you
[3:35:04.880 --> 3:35:10.960]  imagine what the other 900 99 it were i i don't even want to think about it but but we're in a
[3:35:10.960 --> 3:35:18.640]  situation right now where we are told something but we're seeing something different we're told
[3:35:18.640 --> 3:35:23.840]  we're a free nation we're still told that we're an exception but but what is actually going on in
[3:35:23.840 --> 3:35:30.960]  our country and for 120 years yes they have bought the presidencies yes it has been very very controlled
[3:35:30.960 --> 3:35:37.760]  can anyone get through to the presidency without being their guy or like in herbert hoover's case
[3:35:38.480 --> 3:35:42.720]  herbert hoover when they got him they actually thought he was going to be the guy they wanted
[3:35:42.720 --> 3:35:48.080]  him to be because he was pretty entrenched into these people but the problem was was he kind of
[3:35:48.080 --> 3:35:52.160]  had to change a heart in office and he started doing things and listening to people that were
[3:35:52.160 --> 3:35:58.000]  not part of the club not part of the mothership you know uh the cfr and so what did they do
[3:35:58.000 --> 3:36:03.040]  they demonized him by calling it hoover's depression that's how that came about hoover's
[3:36:03.040 --> 3:36:08.960]  depression and so yeah there have been people in history that have had a change of heart or if they
[3:36:08.960 --> 3:36:17.760]  ever tried to out uh like the cia tried to out things uh jfk um or you know i'm his brother or
[3:36:18.560 --> 3:36:23.760]  several presidents several presidents that had mysterious deaths you know if they if they try
[3:36:23.760 --> 3:36:30.800]  to turn they kind of let them have it or let them have it but can a president get in no no
[3:36:30.800 --> 3:36:35.840]  not unless they think they can control you or they think that they can control the puppet
[3:36:35.840 --> 3:36:39.840]  strings because we know they're not actually running the country right we know that hormala
[3:36:40.640 --> 3:36:47.920]  brought a lot are not running this country and i know you guys know that and so what it comes down
[3:36:47.920 --> 3:36:54.160]  to is if they can keep you focused and in the tribes then they can still loot america right
[3:36:54.160 --> 3:36:59.120]  which is what they're doing trillions of dollars disappearing just all the time right the day before
[3:36:59.120 --> 3:37:05.120]  9 11 last year we had and this year we had trillions of dollars missing we have black holes
[3:37:05.120 --> 3:37:11.200]  like nasa and all of these places where money is basically laundered so we have a lot of situations
[3:37:11.200 --> 3:37:21.120]  where the i guess the they are able to loot it and loot it while we're focused on this
[3:37:21.120 --> 3:37:26.800]  peripheral stuff over here and that's how it works so right now they want to keep us kind of geared
[3:37:26.800 --> 3:37:33.600]  more to the right and this is why i think they're showing biden's frailties biden the lunatic uh
[3:37:33.600 --> 3:37:39.200]  the lunatic left and everything is transgender and nobody knows what a woman is and nobody knows
[3:37:39.200 --> 3:37:45.360]  what gender is i think even some liberal progressives are going seriously and so why do they want to do
[3:37:45.360 --> 3:37:52.240]  that is it easier for us to bend to the right a little bit is it easier for us to kind of get us
[3:37:52.240 --> 3:38:00.000]  to this point where then we sanction some sort of hero on the right to go in to save us this is the
[3:38:00.000 --> 3:38:04.400]  problem though it's never going to save us it's never going to save us nobody's ever going to
[3:38:04.400 --> 3:38:12.000]  save us we are we're the only ones that can do it and we need to do it in mass january 6 if millions
[3:38:12.000 --> 3:38:15.760]  of people would have shown up 20 million people would have shown up do you think they could have
[3:38:15.760 --> 3:38:20.720]  gotten away with that do you really think they could have gotten away with it because i don't
[3:38:20.720 --> 3:38:25.920]  think they could have too many people would have shown up and that's why more and more people need
[3:38:25.920 --> 3:38:30.640]  to show up all the time and that's really what's going to save this country is it's going to have
[3:38:30.640 --> 3:38:37.120]  to be the silent majority that shows up that actually says we're not going to do this anymore
[3:38:37.120 --> 3:38:41.280]  and get out of the tribes i think that's one of the big ones i'm still a registered republican in
[3:38:41.280 --> 3:38:46.000]  my state because i have to be but i know what the party is about and i know how they control and i
[3:38:46.000 --> 3:38:51.200]  think that's the biggest message is how do they control and it's kind of like the delivery system
[3:38:51.200 --> 3:38:57.920]  of two messages let me explain why you have a defund the police which now all the liberals are saying
[3:38:57.920 --> 3:39:04.160]  well we don't really mean it and then we have back the blue do you think that might be from
[3:39:04.160 --> 3:39:10.480]  the same people because what does back the blue do it goes to the other way in the extreme back
[3:39:10.480 --> 3:39:14.720]  the blue is there to say cops you can get away with whatever you want even if you become a
[3:39:14.720 --> 3:39:20.480]  federalized unit it's fine no more local police it's okay we back the blue back the blue sounds
[3:39:20.480 --> 3:39:26.080]  patriotic they want it to sound patriotic but the problem is is that it gives a blank check
[3:39:26.080 --> 3:39:33.360]  that's not okay that's saying that no matter what you do it's okay because now we're so desperate
[3:39:33.360 --> 3:39:38.320]  we need to back you you know never in my life did i ever feel like we had to say that we believed
[3:39:38.320 --> 3:39:45.600]  in cops because pretty much all of you just figured that you know cops should be there right why back
[3:39:45.600 --> 3:39:51.840]  the blue did back the blue was that really the message they wanted to get out was defund the
[3:39:51.840 --> 3:39:57.120]  police the coin was that the was that the part of the message that you know yeah we're going to
[3:39:57.120 --> 3:40:02.400]  shove this out front but really what we want people to do is say back the blue look at you've
[3:40:02.400 --> 3:40:09.760]  all day right why did they show you that why did they say to you that the local cops screwed up
[3:40:09.760 --> 3:40:14.480]  and it was ice that came in to save the day or the feds because they want to go to a federalized
[3:40:14.480 --> 3:40:21.440]  police state i think both messages were devised by the same group i also think that they do this all
[3:40:21.440 --> 3:40:26.240]  the time it's the bait and switch so everybody rushes to the defense of cops it's kind of like
[3:40:26.240 --> 3:40:34.720]  saying i believe in books you know i will back the books well do we not have books of course we
[3:40:34.720 --> 3:40:41.840]  have books but if it's a slogan then people think it's in trouble that's how it works they aren't
[3:40:41.840 --> 3:40:48.160]  in trouble we just need to recognize that they're trying to impose more federalized police on us
[3:40:48.160 --> 3:40:54.080]  than we already have local cops usually are not going to be the ones in a red flag situation to
[3:40:54.080 --> 3:40:58.800]  take your gun local cops are usually because we're they're accountable they're in your neighborhoods
[3:40:58.800 --> 3:41:02.320]  and i'm not talking about the badge heavy cops we have enough of those i'm talking about just
[3:41:02.320 --> 3:41:07.920]  good cops i know you know some i know some but the deal is is that we kind of are giving them this
[3:41:07.920 --> 3:41:14.240]  blank check and people are using it to get elected so what do they do i back the blue
[3:41:14.240 --> 3:41:19.360]  just back the blue and then we go oh they must be a conservative and oh they must be a good guy
[3:41:19.360 --> 3:41:25.040]  or a good woman if they just say back the blue it's a really great tactic pro life used to work
[3:41:25.600 --> 3:41:29.920]  they used to just say i'm pro life and then everyone would go yay pro life but i'm never
[3:41:29.920 --> 3:41:35.360]  going to do anything about it so same kind of thing it's a tactic so be careful of the tactics
[3:41:35.360 --> 3:41:39.840]  i'm always looking at at things like this and thinking oh my gosh are we seeing what they
[3:41:39.840 --> 3:41:45.280]  really wanted us to do in this case because you've all day was this great case for them to say
[3:41:45.280 --> 3:41:50.240]  oh local cops will always mess up you really need ice you need ice to just be lingering around for
[3:41:50.240 --> 3:41:56.960]  no apparent reason and they can come in and save the day i hate that message because i want the
[3:41:56.960 --> 3:42:02.560]  local cops because i know they're more accountable and i know they won't screw me over in red flag
[3:42:03.840 --> 3:42:08.480]  and we're gonna definitely have this red flag they're enticing the state so much since
[3:42:08.480 --> 3:42:14.880]  biden signed that that they want those they want every single state in this great union
[3:42:14.880 --> 3:42:23.040]  to take on red flag and red flag is absolutely the opposite of the constitution it rips apart so
[3:42:23.040 --> 3:42:31.280]  many uh constitutional protections of god given rights and we have to be really watchful of that
[3:42:31.280 --> 3:42:35.840]  it's a real disgrace and so you can just call up on anybody and get their guns taken and they
[3:42:35.840 --> 3:42:41.520]  have to fight to get them back and really without a warrant judge just signs off on it it's a whole
[3:42:41.520 --> 3:42:48.240]  system and they're gonna get really good at it for the patriots in this country i mean what's
[3:42:48.240 --> 3:42:53.520]  better than to call up on the on a patriot and say oh yeah i think you're unstable yeah right

[3:47:16.880 --> 3:47:22.000]  com all right so if you're just joining us because i know people jump in and out of the car or
[3:47:22.000 --> 3:47:27.120]  whatever the situation is i'll catch you up it's really quick actually we are literally
[3:47:27.120 --> 3:47:33.280]  worshiping bail at every sports event now why sports i don't know we just are we better recognize
[3:47:33.280 --> 3:47:39.520]  what we're doing as a world i sure hope we do this stuff cannot fly we cannot live in a world
[3:47:39.520 --> 3:47:44.720]  where we're worshiping the very things we were warned about not worshiping give me a break um
[3:47:44.720 --> 3:47:50.720]  also government has no authority to control the economy none whatsoever but we are trained
[3:47:50.720 --> 3:47:56.560]  that government is in charge of the economy they're not and we need to get back to educating
[3:47:56.560 --> 3:48:01.840]  the masses on this and get them out of that control mindset because we are the ones that
[3:48:01.840 --> 3:48:08.880]  that that do what we do and that that's what built america on free enterprise so i also
[3:48:08.880 --> 3:48:13.760]  wanted to mention the trick the military is being played the if you the military is not going with
[3:48:13.760 --> 3:48:18.160]  what the court said they're actually going against it shame on them and they're telling people if you
[3:48:18.160 --> 3:48:24.160]  don't get the vax 30 days you can't come back to work so people are not showing up and then what
[3:48:24.160 --> 3:48:28.400]  they're doing is they're claiming that they went a wall has nothing to do with the shot right
[3:48:28.400 --> 3:48:34.160]  they're just claiming they went a wall to get them out don't fall for it tell a military friend or
[3:48:34.160 --> 3:48:39.520]  family member show up just keep showing up okay don't fall for that trick and it's really sad
[3:48:39.520 --> 3:48:43.760]  that they're playing a trick like that when did our military become guinea pigs i don't know
[3:48:43.760 --> 3:48:48.880]  and to all of you that have fought to all of you that are out there that are part of our military
[3:48:48.880 --> 3:48:53.600]  you know god bless you because i i love our military i just don't want to see you guys get
[3:48:53.600 --> 3:49:00.880]  messed over also get out of the parties nothing has ever been repealed in a hundred years why is
[3:49:00.880 --> 3:49:05.680]  that because the train only moves one way both parties are in on it both parties behind the
[3:49:05.680 --> 3:49:10.960]  scenes are one party and so you'll never see anything that we complain about on the right
[3:49:10.960 --> 3:49:16.640]  is conservative ever get repealed there's a reason for that and there's a reason we have
[3:49:16.640 --> 3:49:21.760]  huge omnibus bills packed with billions and billions and billions of dollars and how do
[3:49:21.760 --> 3:49:27.680]  they get them through they just say it's for the military it's an easy excuse and we have a lot of
[3:49:27.680 --> 3:49:34.560]  excuses as to why we can't get anything in that actually goes back to liberty and so in our freedom
[3:49:34.560 --> 3:49:39.520]  and this is why the left the leftist communists i'm talking about the communist diehard communists
[3:49:39.520 --> 3:49:44.640]  have really really seek to ruin this country to destroy it right from the inside out that's all
[3:49:44.640 --> 3:49:50.320]  they're doing but the right isn't doing anything it's kind of like the capital police 140 officers
[3:49:50.320 --> 3:49:55.680]  i guess just stood there with their arms down getting punched i guess um there wasn't a mark on
[3:49:55.680 --> 3:50:02.640]  anyone else uh so it's kind of a one-way a one-way fight and if the right were actually as invested
[3:50:02.640 --> 3:50:06.160]  as the left wasn't destroying the country if the right was standing up for we wouldn't be in this
[3:50:06.160 --> 3:50:12.480]  pickle we wouldn't be in this hot mess that we're in so and back the blue is a tactic back the blue
[3:50:12.480 --> 3:50:19.200]  is a tactic um and i think it's a tactic to actually serve up the left believe it or not it's really
[3:50:19.200 --> 3:50:25.360]  not about supporting cops it's about supporting a big heavy federalized police force is really the
[3:50:25.360 --> 3:50:31.120]  game behind back the blue and uh we cannot change things in this mess until we get out of the tribe
[3:50:31.120 --> 3:50:36.720]  mentality into the parties it's not about is our guy gonna win it's about what do they do
[3:50:36.720 --> 3:50:41.440]  once they're in there regardless of the party as we can see with people like the schmuck romney
[3:50:41.440 --> 3:50:47.920]  you know um what a disgrace to our country and uh says he's a republican he's not he's not he's a
[3:50:47.920 --> 3:50:53.280]  liberal progressive and always has been but he won't admit it i don't like liars i want he won't
[3:50:53.280 --> 3:51:00.000]  admit it and so we have a problem with who's who's right who's left who's blue who's red
[3:51:00.000 --> 3:51:06.480]  because that's not the way it swings anyway so we really need to start calling out these tribes
[3:51:06.480 --> 3:51:11.760]  i also want to say this um there's another uh there's another kind of weapon on the left
[3:51:11.760 --> 3:51:15.840]  that i've noticed see i'm a mom and i'm gonna i'm gonna speak from that angle because i've
[3:51:15.840 --> 3:51:21.200]  been seeing this over and over again and it's called the word kindness okay you've seen nothing
[3:51:21.200 --> 3:51:27.600]  but those be kind t-shirts be kind slogans everybody's telling you to be kind my first
[3:51:27.600 --> 3:51:33.520]  thought when i saw that was why were we unkind when did we become an unkind people i don't remember
[3:51:33.520 --> 3:51:40.400]  that i everybody i know is kind why are we being told to be kind well here's a thought for you just
[3:51:40.400 --> 3:51:45.600]  as a mom and as a christian i have to say this because it's driving me nuts when i go into the
[3:51:45.600 --> 3:51:50.400]  stores and i see this especially at like target i mean all these stores selling this this uh
[3:51:50.400 --> 3:51:55.920]  this word over and over again from what i can recognize what i found i grew up in california
[3:51:55.920 --> 3:52:00.560]  and i grew up around a lot of liberals so i still have liberals as friends believe it or not
[3:52:00.560 --> 3:52:07.120]  we just don't talk politics uh so i noticed that parenting skews to a way of saying
[3:52:08.160 --> 3:52:13.360]  my child is kind therefore i'm a good parent because my child is kind this is why they're
[3:52:13.360 --> 3:52:19.440]  dragging them to drag shows this is why they're implementing the everyone's different and unique
[3:52:19.440 --> 3:52:25.200]  and you've gotta love everybody because it's all about how kind you are that's the measuring stick
[3:52:25.200 --> 3:52:31.840]  okay the focus if you will is on kindness it's really kind of strange because what happens
[3:52:31.840 --> 3:52:37.600]  is is i know that i was raised in a home where kindness was just the result of everything i was
[3:52:37.600 --> 3:52:44.160]  taught right it was the result so i was taught you know you taught integrity and character and trust
[3:52:44.160 --> 3:52:48.720]  and uh the commandments and you're taught about god and you're taught about all of these things
[3:52:48.720 --> 3:52:55.600]  well kindness just comes out because you're taught really good healthy things as a kid you know and
[3:52:55.600 --> 3:53:00.800]  so now what are they doing the focus is on kindness and let me give you kind of an example of this
[3:53:00.800 --> 3:53:06.240]  there was a story about a guy who was raised this way thought this way very very very liberal and
[3:53:06.240 --> 3:53:11.280]  everything was just about patting himself on the back to be a kind person so he goes down to the
[3:53:11.280 --> 3:53:18.080]  border and he has a marxist front company a marxist front company okay totally deceptive goes down
[3:53:18.080 --> 3:53:24.640]  to the border and puts out food and water for all the illegals and the gist of his message was the
[3:53:24.640 --> 3:53:29.920]  illegals just i don't know got helicoptered in i guess and just sort of arrived and so he needed
[3:53:29.920 --> 3:53:36.080]  to go help it wasn't because they did something illegal crossing the border no it was just because
[3:53:36.080 --> 3:53:41.680]  they just arrived and so he had to go and and take on this burden for himself and he had to go
[3:53:41.680 --> 3:53:49.600]  into a very deceptive company and go in and deliver water and food as if he's the nicest guy on the
[3:53:49.600 --> 3:53:55.360]  planet i think this is what happens when you teach kindness but you leave out all the other stuff
[3:53:55.360 --> 3:54:01.520]  like god like i don't know the commandments like uh like anything uh that i was taught
[3:54:01.520 --> 3:54:06.320]  you integrity honesty character that's usually what parents hard work that's usually what parents
[3:54:06.320 --> 3:54:13.360]  are raising their kids with but the focus to be on kind produces a person where it doesn't
[3:54:13.360 --> 3:54:19.280]  matter what you have to do the the means to an end the means don't matter because it's all about
[3:54:19.280 --> 3:54:25.840]  can i justify my level of kindness in this moment then i'm a good person you know five five year
[3:54:25.840 --> 3:54:30.240]  olds don't need to go to drag shows that doesn't make them a nicer human being the only thing
[3:54:30.240 --> 3:54:36.000]  that's happening there is the parent and their own personal glorified weirdness is saying look
[3:54:36.000 --> 3:54:42.880]  at me i'm a wonderful parent i'm i'm uh i'm embracing everybody kid doesn't need to go to a drag
[3:54:42.880 --> 3:54:49.040]  show honey and why are they going to a drag show most importantly at the age of five they should
[3:54:49.040 --> 3:54:55.040]  be home playing with dolls or trucks and being a normal kid but this is what it's all about see
[3:54:55.040 --> 3:55:02.640]  they come in on the guise of kindness to sell you a box of rocks that says um basically we're here
[3:55:02.640 --> 3:55:08.560]  for the uh everyone's a bully and we're here to train them to be kind when really it's just a
[3:55:08.560 --> 3:55:16.080]  promotion of lgbtq in the schools please get your kids out of these schools if i could do one thing
[3:55:16.080 --> 3:55:20.880]  different it would have been to homeschool i wish i would have i wish i would have i didn't know
[3:55:20.880 --> 3:55:26.480]  enough about it and my kids were already in that system and then we when they came home we had to
[3:55:26.480 --> 3:55:31.840]  reeducate them from all the falsehoods and socialism they were taught and now it's even worse
[3:55:31.840 --> 3:55:39.680]  get your kids out save your kids from the system but this focus on kindness see what it basically is
[3:55:39.680 --> 3:55:48.400]  is if you identify any immorality because you were taught right and wrong be kind is the slogan
[3:55:48.400 --> 3:55:54.960]  to basically shut you up it's basically there to say yeah you know you're not allowed to say
[3:55:54.960 --> 3:56:01.040]  anything because it's unkind so doing that sort of check like hey what about right and wrong
[3:56:01.040 --> 3:56:07.200]  because i know if i if i come across somebody and i feel like well that's wrong or maybe i was
[3:56:07.200 --> 3:56:12.080]  taught that something was wrong i'm still going to be loving and kind but i'm also going to state the
[3:56:12.080 --> 3:56:20.560]  truth what be kind does is squash the part where you tell the truth and it's just total acceptance
[3:56:20.560 --> 3:56:26.480]  of anything and everything and that's what they're teaching their kids anything and everything no
[3:56:26.480 --> 3:56:33.680]  boundaries no right and wrong just be kind and you get a giant gold star it's wrong on a lot of
[3:56:33.680 --> 3:56:39.680]  levels but it's a really easy twisting and all of these things that i'm noticing all the time
[3:56:39.680 --> 3:56:44.000]  with the rhetoric and the changing of words and the changing of definitions that's going on right
[3:56:44.000 --> 3:56:51.200]  now reagan was right about that the changing of words is the twisting of the meaning behind
[3:56:51.200 --> 3:56:57.280]  the words and what they really mean to say we've got to save our kids from this nonsense have this
[3:56:57.280 --> 3:57:02.480]  discussion with your kids at the dinner table and see what they have to say because everything
[3:57:02.480 --> 3:57:06.880]  that they're surrounded with at school as we're about to go back into the school season is all
[3:57:06.880 --> 3:57:12.720]  about be kind don't stand up for god don't stand up for anything don't say what you mean do not
[3:57:12.720 --> 3:57:20.080]  say anything that's right or wrong just simply smile and be kind and let it go that is not the
[3:57:20.080 --> 3:57:25.280]  right message for our kids our kids need those boundaries they need to know right from wrong
[3:57:25.840 --> 3:57:32.000]  it's very simple but be wary of the kindness overload that you're probably noticing too
[3:57:32.000 --> 3:57:38.000]  i see one more t-shirt i swear with the kind of i'm already kind that's one of the nicest people
