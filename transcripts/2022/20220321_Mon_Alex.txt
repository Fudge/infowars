[00:00:01.772 --> 00:00:04.235]  I'm ready for negotiations with him.
[00:00:04.596 --> 00:00:18.210]   I was ready over the last two years and I think that I think that without negotiations, we cannot end this war.
[00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:31.194]  So I think that we have to use any format, any chance in order to have the possibility of negotiating, the possibility of talking to Putin.
[00:00:31.274 --> 00:00:39.267]   But if these attempts fail, that would mean That this is a third world war.
[00:00:39.527 --> 00:00:41.947]  We must go to war with Russia.
[00:00:42.487 --> 00:00:44.168]  NATO and America must come into the fight.
[00:00:44.488 --> 00:00:48.469]  Or, or, there'll be World War 3.
[00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.670]  That is doublespeak right out of 1984.
[00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:57.651]  We must have nuclear war to stop nuclear war.
[00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.870]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:15.870]  It's Monday, March 21st, and here's the latest.
[00:01:16.335 --> 00:01:16.535]  Wow!
[00:01:16.355 --> 00:01:31.555]  What a time, my friends, to be alive on this planet.
[00:01:31.555 --> 00:01:32.554]  Wow!
[00:01:32.554 --> 00:01:38.873]   Zelensky, that we're told is the second coming of Christ, has outlawed all opposition parties.
[00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:49.121]  He'd already outlawed the conservative parties and other parties that opposed him and banned any TV stations or media that criticized him a few years ago and locked up tens of thousands of political dissidents.
[00:01:49.581 --> 00:01:53.362]  But now he banned the remaining 11 liberal opposition parties.
[00:01:53.982 --> 00:01:55.523]  No other parties are allowed to operate.
[00:01:55.583 --> 00:02:00.404]  He seized control and announced all media is being put into one channel now.
[00:02:01.348 --> 00:02:02.790]  That is real freedom.
[00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.732]  And he threatened nuclear war.
[00:02:04.772 --> 00:02:09.777]  He said, if you don't start a war with Russia and attack them, NATO, there'll be nuclear war.
[00:02:10.157 --> 00:02:15.863]  Translated, if you don't start World War III, there will be World War III.
[00:02:16.964 --> 00:02:21.429]  Here is a clip of him on CNN with Bilderberg Group member Fareed Zarkaria.
[00:02:22.748 --> 00:02:32.895]  Will it be hard, will it be painful for you to have to sit down with Putin were he to agree and negotiate with him?
[00:02:35.396 --> 00:02:37.177]  I'm ready for negotiations with him.
[00:02:38.218 --> 00:02:52.329]   I was ready over the last two years and I think that I think that without negotiations, we cannot end this war.
[00:02:52.629 --> 00:03:04.836]  So I think that we have to use any format, any chance in order to have the possibility of negotiating, the possibility of talking to Putin.
[00:03:04.896 --> 00:03:10.419]  But if these attempts fail, that would mean that this is a third world war.
[00:03:14.053 --> 00:03:15.634]  Okay, so there you go.
[00:03:16.234 --> 00:03:26.239]  Now here's Biden bragging about the bombing of Belgrade for 78 days in the mid-1990s and 1999, bragging about what happened.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.460]  And that's what the Russians are pointing out.
[00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:43.147]  The UN went in and bombed out a country, and literally did more intense bombing than Putin's doing, targeting even civilian targets, blowing up Chinese embassies, you name it, using depleted uranium, and that's all liberal and trendy and good.
[00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:54.178]  It was all based on a fake ITN-BBC report that people were starving to death when it showed a man with tuberculosis with his hands on a fence wanting into the UN food station.
[00:03:54.798 --> 00:03:57.861]  They said that was a man in a Serbian concentration camp.
[00:03:58.161 --> 00:04:03.406]  So Hitler's always invoked by both sides in anything since World War II.
[00:04:03.446 --> 00:04:04.007]  It's incredible.
[00:04:04.507 --> 00:04:08.591]  But here he is bragging about the war crimes of bombing Serbia.
[00:04:09.245 --> 00:04:15.963]   I'm just wanting to know what you suggest because back then when I was in your position I was suggesting we bomb Belgrade
[00:04:15.963 --> 00:04:22.764]   I was suggesting that we send American pilots in and blow up all the bridges on the Drina
[00:04:22.764 --> 00:04:29.324]   I was suggesting we take out his oil supplies. I was suggesting very specific action. It isn't as interesting
[00:04:29.324 --> 00:04:34.305]   that we And now we've got the endless footage on the news a Bush
[00:04:34.305 --> 00:04:37.644]   senior little evil son
[00:04:37.644 --> 00:04:46.144]   another warmonger along with Bill Clinton delivering wreaths to the big Ukrainian church in DC
[00:04:46.144 --> 00:04:51.283]   Saying they're sorry for the war crimes of Putin when those two launched multiple
[00:04:51.283 --> 00:04:55.424]   illegal wars a piece Obama also did the same thing.
[00:04:56.264 --> 00:04:58.585]  11 million dead under their belts.
[00:05:01.405 --> 00:05:06.554]  Obama, Bush, and Clinton from civilian deaths from starvation.
[00:05:06.574 --> 00:05:07.876]  But isn't that the name of the game?
[00:05:08.497 --> 00:05:14.446]  Speaking of that, we told you it was coming in my seminal film, The Obama Deception.
[00:05:15.512 --> 00:05:24.035]  I spent 10 minutes in that film on carbon taxes and how they would soon, within the year 2025, ask for you to give up your pets.
[00:05:24.855 --> 00:05:30.677]  Well, now BBC, Bloomberg and others are saying, kill your dog and kill your cat to stop Putin.
[00:05:30.717 --> 00:05:31.517]  I'm not joking.
[00:05:31.997 --> 00:05:33.638]  It's all coming up today.
[00:05:34.198 --> 00:05:36.879]  They're offering a dystopian future.
[00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:40.740]  They are demanding you submit and turn over everything.
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.541]  It's a war on life.
[00:05:43.281 --> 00:05:46.862]  It's Monday, March 21st, 2022.
[00:05:47.622 --> 00:05:54.445]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, riding like the one-eyed jack of diamonds with the devil close behind.
[00:05:55.025 --> 00:05:56.505]  Get behind me, Satan!
[00:06:01.347 --> 00:06:06.669]  Ladies and gentlemen, extremely blessed and honored to be here with you today in defense of liberty.
[00:06:07.478 --> 00:06:08.799]  And resistance to tyranny.
[00:06:12.421 --> 00:06:25.330]  I need to go over the Ukraine news and the world economic news and how it ties into the Great Reset, the massive new COVID news, a bunch of critical news on the transhumanist depopulation program.
[00:06:27.092 --> 00:06:33.096]  Criminal terrorists target wealthy American neighborhoods in dangerous, deadly crime sprees.
[00:06:34.824 --> 00:06:38.346]  The New York Times and others coming out and saying, time to get rid of the First Amendment.
[00:06:38.967 --> 00:06:43.009]  They say if you're not certified by a fact checker, you will be banned.
[00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.872]  The New York Times is the headline, America has a free speech problem.
[00:06:48.813 --> 00:06:54.516]  All this and more coming up today.
[00:06:54.536 --> 00:06:58.659]  We have several really informative guests joining us.
[00:06:58.739 --> 00:07:02.862]  One of them is the legendary, for his predictions, Martin Armstrong.
[00:07:04.394 --> 00:07:11.556]  To break down what he sees in the economy with the Great Reset, with the stock market, with energy prices, with inflation and more.
[00:07:11.576 --> 00:07:18.639]  And then my good friend, Dr. Ben Marble will be joining us as well.
[00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:22.400]  So all this and more today.
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:33.024]  Paul Joseph Watson has a lot to break down and he'll be joining us coming up at the bottom of the hour in about 22 minutes from now.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:41.704]  Now that said, I am going to wait on this until the start of the next hour.
[00:07:42.884 --> 00:07:47.547]  And then for one segment, I'm going to cover it and then I'm going to go to Dr. Ben Marble for the next 45 minutes.
[00:07:48.007 --> 00:07:53.550]  She has a lot of life-saving things to break down and a lot of new intel and hindsight as the whole COVID narrative falls apart.
[00:07:54.871 --> 00:08:03.195]  It's important to keep hammering that to bring these criminals to justice and to stop them from continuing their lockdowns in police state around the world and bringing it back here.
[00:08:04.704 --> 00:08:12.747]  But I knew this day was coming, and now it's here when they start turning the energy off, where they now demand you kill your dog or cat.
[00:08:14.828 --> 00:08:19.890]  They're also demanding that all existing cows be slaughtered, and that the sale of beef be banned.
[00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:22.631]  That is the final endgame of this.
[00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:29.694]  Now you remember back when I made the Obama deception, 15-16 years ago now, how time flies.
[00:08:30.774 --> 00:08:32.775]  He was running for office and then just got elected.
[00:08:34.633 --> 00:08:36.314]  So I guess that's 13, 14 years ago.
[00:08:36.354 --> 00:08:38.156]  Let me see, 8 and 12, yeah.
[00:08:38.176 --> 00:08:39.197]  13, almost 14 years ago.
[00:08:41.298 --> 00:08:44.261]  I said that they would call for banning your home pets.
[00:08:44.901 --> 00:08:45.922]  First, they would tax them.
[00:08:47.223 --> 00:08:51.867]  Australia, the UK, and Canada are now openly proposing this.
[00:08:53.508 --> 00:08:55.890]  Everything you do will be taxed, regulated, controlled.
[00:08:56.351 --> 00:09:01.855]  All life on Earth will be seen as criminal and will be surveilled by AI.
[00:09:02.796 --> 00:09:03.917]  This is the new feudalism.
[00:09:05.148 --> 00:09:16.660]  Bloomberg has come out, there's a big article on Infowars.com, backlash as media says, let pets die and don't eat meat, while globalist energy agency, the UN, calls for climate lockdowns.
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.804]  It's all officially happening.
[00:09:21.685 --> 00:09:27.471]  This is the feudalism, this is the post-industrial world that you have been warned about.
[00:09:28.695 --> 00:09:31.096]  They already came for your children and have killed millions of them.
[00:09:31.136 --> 00:09:32.756]  Now they want to kill already born children.
[00:09:33.136 --> 00:09:38.417]  Have legislation entered multiple states to kill children up to 20 plus weeks after they're born.
[00:09:40.458 --> 00:09:46.859]  And so now, they're going to come for your dogs and your cats and hold them hostage until you submit to them entirely.
[00:09:46.879 --> 00:09:49.279]  If you're a new listener, this is not a joke.
[00:09:49.299 --> 00:09:53.120]  It's like when they say, a man with a penis.
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.501]  He hasn't even had it removed.
[00:09:54.681 --> 00:09:56.301]  Bulging penis.
[00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:03.773]  Goes and wins the women's swim race and beats an Olympic gold medalist.
[00:10:04.834 --> 00:10:10.237]  He was 400 and something in the men, but now he's number one in the women.
[00:10:10.557 --> 00:10:21.763]  And he doesn't even, even though he has bigger bones and higher blood supply and twice the strength on average, he's even got the sports enhancing testicles and Johnson.
[00:10:22.944 --> 00:10:31.146]   And the media tried to accuse I saw the left, some of the publications accusing Tucker Carlson Friday of adding genitals.
[00:10:31.566 --> 00:10:40.669]  Now I went to the original Getty photo and there is his large flaccid genitals.
[00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:43.950]  I mean this guy just isn't a guy.
[00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:44.950]  He's like a huge guy.
[00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:48.411]  The women are half his size and he's packing an anaconda in his pants.
[00:10:49.172 --> 00:10:50.292]  Got some heavy firepower.
[00:10:51.804 --> 00:10:55.067]  And, I mean, you'll accept killing your dog and cat!
[00:10:55.247 --> 00:10:57.209]  You'll accept drag queen pedophile story time!
[00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:04.655]  So why wouldn't you accept a six-foot-three dude beating up the women?
[00:11:04.755 --> 00:11:09.419]  I mean, this is South Park now becoming reality.
[00:11:09.459 --> 00:11:11.361]  South Park is tomorrow's news today.
[00:11:12.466 --> 00:11:13.667]  This is not a joke.
[00:11:13.867 --> 00:11:16.168]  All we need is the cowboy hat on the man.
[00:11:17.008 --> 00:11:17.769]  I mean, look at those women.
[00:11:17.929 --> 00:11:19.609]  By the way, those are good-sized women he beat.
[00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.891]  He's like a foot plus taller than them.
[00:11:22.551 --> 00:11:23.231]  He's a big dude.
[00:11:23.251 --> 00:11:29.014]  He's a big competitive swimmer that couldn't win against men.
[00:11:30.495 --> 00:11:32.055]  So now he bullies women.
[00:11:34.397 --> 00:11:37.058]  Unbelievable.
[00:11:38.553 --> 00:11:53.827]  But again, if they're going to get you to accept tyranny, and get you to accept evil, and get you to throw all your rights and freedoms out the window, they've got to wage war on common sense.
[00:11:53.867 --> 00:11:58.992]  They've got to wage war on reality, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:00.834 --> 00:12:06.333]   We're going to go to break in a few minutes, and I'm going to come back and get into The huge news.
[00:12:07.374 --> 00:12:12.558]  Are the Russian elite planning to poison Putin and have him replaced with a chosen successor?
[00:12:12.979 --> 00:12:14.940]  I'll give you the best analysis of that when we come back.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.384]  Zelensky says World War III is going to start if we don't attack Russia and start World War III.
[00:12:20.345 --> 00:12:24.288]  He's also outlawed all opposition parties and basically declared martial law.
[00:12:25.077 --> 00:12:26.858]  But that's what the good guys do, I guess, nowadays.
[00:12:27.738 --> 00:12:35.001]  The CDC's credibility takes another blow after another, quote, mistake is revised from the organized fraud they were engaged in.
[00:12:35.362 --> 00:12:37.142]  Now they try to cover their criminal asses.
[00:12:39.143 --> 00:12:44.205]  That is all coming up today.
[00:12:44.265 --> 00:12:51.208]  We've got the newest chilling footage out of China as well, where they're beating people up that don't wear a mask and taking them for one year in prison.
[00:12:51.609 --> 00:12:53.169]  Everything you see in China is coming here.
[00:12:53.449 --> 00:12:54.490]  The social credit score.
[00:12:55.899 --> 00:12:56.740]  The medical tyranny.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.141]  You want to take a look at the future?
[00:12:58.201 --> 00:13:00.643]  It's not a boot-stomping on the human face forever.
[00:13:00.803 --> 00:13:02.044]  It's far worse.
[00:13:02.124 --> 00:13:06.727]  It's suicide nets, robot control, drones, total surveillance, forced inoculations.
[00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.789]  It is.
[00:13:09.349 --> 00:13:12.632]  Thousands of vehicles showing up to take millions to camps.
[00:13:13.332 --> 00:13:20.898]  All in huge martial law drills of that cookie-cutter authoritarian society.
[00:13:22.599 --> 00:13:25.502]  It's all coming up here today on the broadcast they want to ban.
[00:13:27.529 --> 00:13:32.692]  Let me just be point-blank with the listeners, and I'm gonna have to do a whole hour on this soon to explain all this, just so you know where we're at.
[00:13:33.933 --> 00:13:40.036]  The Democratic Party has been trying to shut us down for four years with all these Democratic Party-funded lawsuits.
[00:13:40.457 --> 00:13:41.817]  They filed over 50 lawsuits.
[00:13:41.857 --> 00:13:45.459]  We knocked them down to four lawsuits right now.
[00:13:47.341 --> 00:13:48.721]  And so that's going on.
[00:13:49.262 --> 00:13:50.843]  One of them just got knocked out Friday.
[00:13:51.503 --> 00:13:52.463]  But there's four left.
[00:13:52.724 --> 00:13:53.384]  Totally rigged.
[00:13:53.444 --> 00:13:53.984]  Rigged courts.
[00:13:54.004 --> 00:13:54.925]  100% fraud, in my view.
[00:13:58.195 --> 00:13:59.697]  Absolute dirty tricks, you name it.
[00:13:59.797 --> 00:14:03.262]  And they admit the goal is not even to get money from us, because we don't have a bunch of extra money.
[00:14:03.382 --> 00:14:04.423]  It is to put us out of business.
[00:14:05.765 --> 00:14:09.349]  And so I need to be able to fully fight through four trials.
[00:14:10.916 --> 00:14:15.359]  Three in Texas and one in Connecticut that start April 25th next month.
[00:14:15.959 --> 00:14:24.484]  And even when lawyers give me good prices on these, working full-time with a team of three people to actually even put on a defense, even though I've been defaulted, they hope I just don't show up.
[00:14:24.724 --> 00:14:27.705]  I'm still gonna go in there and have them gag us and not let us hear.
[00:14:27.725 --> 00:14:30.067]  And the jury, I hope, will be smart enough to see this is tyranny.
[00:14:30.087 --> 00:14:31.628]  But whatever, we're gonna fight all the way.
[00:14:31.648 --> 00:14:36.771]  It takes a lot of money, ladies and gentlemen, to do that.
[00:14:37.011 --> 00:14:38.792]  And we don't have the money.
[00:14:39.861 --> 00:14:42.042]  To carry that out and keep Infowars on the air.
[00:14:43.003 --> 00:14:47.986]  And so I make it very easy for you to keep us on air and really fight these tyrants.
[00:14:48.786 --> 00:14:50.247]  And every day we're on air is precious.
[00:14:50.307 --> 00:14:52.428]  Every day on air we're making huge breakthroughs.
[00:14:53.469 --> 00:14:57.071]  Of course we've got all sorts of friends and groups and organizations and systems.
[00:14:57.091 --> 00:14:58.252]  They're not going to take me off air.
[00:14:58.812 --> 00:15:00.313]  They could shut this place down though.
[00:15:01.134 --> 00:15:03.835]  And so we need funding now more than ever.
[00:15:03.915 --> 00:15:04.836]  We have a huge sale.
[00:15:06.297 --> 00:15:22.905]  Up to 75% off at Infowarstore.com, the biggest sale on t-shirts, you name it, and a bunch of the great supplements like Bio-True Selenium is back in stock, Vazobeats are back in stock, and of course the great Fizzy Magnesium that's so good for you, it's back in stock.
[00:15:23.865 --> 00:15:25.865]  And we're gonna ride.
[00:15:25.865 --> 00:15:33.544]  We're gonna ride.
[00:15:33.544 --> 00:15:43.544]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:15:38.868 --> 00:15:40.950]  With the devil close behind.
[00:15:42.512 --> 00:15:44.013]  But we are the pioneers.
[00:15:44.233 --> 00:15:46.435]  We are the trailblazers.
[00:15:47.296 --> 00:15:54.443]  And we will build the new systems as fast as Satan tries to pull it down and destroy us.
[00:15:58.507 --> 00:15:59.988]  All right, let's plow right into it.
[00:16:00.169 --> 00:16:16.364]   Is it true, everybody's asking me this, I was on A few shows this morning, and both shows asked me on TV, on radio, they said, is it true, like I'm the Oracle or something, that they're going to kill Putin?
[00:16:16.424 --> 00:16:20.426]  And the answer is, absolutely, they're going to try.
[00:16:23.547 --> 00:16:34.973]  And that's why Lindsey Graham on the Armed Services Committee is running around saying three times now, Russia, kill Putin and we'll let you out of this.
[00:16:36.601 --> 00:16:39.702]  And that is something that's done in a lot of countries throughout history of the emperor.
[00:16:40.363 --> 00:16:42.424]  Doesn't do what the establishment likes, they'll get rid of him.
[00:16:42.464 --> 00:16:47.006]  But the establishment in Russia was behind this Ukraine situation.
[00:16:47.026 --> 00:16:52.188]  So I wouldn't hold your breath, but there have been a lot of assassination attempts.
[00:16:52.268 --> 00:16:57.651]  But when you see stuff out of the mirror, hyping it, saying, oh, spies say it's going to happen.
[00:16:58.715 --> 00:17:02.237]  What, the same 25 intelligence heads that told us the Hunter laptop was fake?
[00:17:02.917 --> 00:17:05.018]  Or the ones that told us Trump was a Russian agent?
[00:17:05.038 --> 00:17:05.778]  You mean those liars?
[00:17:06.318 --> 00:17:11.681]  When they say it's going to happen, that's just affirmation voodoo crap.
[00:17:13.762 --> 00:17:18.344]  They don't know it's going to happen and the Russian ruling class is going to kill Putin.
[00:17:19.324 --> 00:17:22.922]   They're just hoping some Weak-minded person hears that and believes it.
[00:17:23.444 --> 00:17:27.994]  Russian elite plan to poison Putin and have chosen a successor.
[00:17:28.515 --> 00:17:29.317]  Claim the spooks.
[00:17:30.714 --> 00:17:34.995]  Criminal insiders are plotting to remove Vladimir Putin by poisoning him.
[00:17:35.055 --> 00:17:37.556]  A Ukraine intelligence body has claimed.
[00:17:37.596 --> 00:17:51.359]  Oh, the same ones that told us about the ghost of Kiev and the massacre at Snake Island and all the actresses and actors they caught going to rubble sites and posing like they'd been climbing out of it with their babies.
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:57.581]  They brag that Zelensky's so good at lying to everyone.
[00:17:58.979 --> 00:18:08.702]  So no, I don't think that that is an imminent thing, but it definitely is in the cards.
[00:18:09.962 --> 00:18:17.964]  But what's really going on is Zelensky, depending on what country he talks to, in the U.S.
[00:18:18.004 --> 00:18:27.073]   he invokes Pearl Harbor and 9-11, and Schwarzenegger invokes January 6th, because you know, his enemy is the American people.
[00:18:27.734 --> 00:18:30.876]  But Zelensky goes to Israel and says, there's a final solution!
[00:18:31.357 --> 00:18:33.899]  Putin's a Nazi, he's gonna kill all the Jews!
[00:18:34.679 --> 00:18:36.761]  Patently fake, patent lie.
[00:18:37.602 --> 00:18:42.266]  Hell, 70% of the Russian oligarchs just fled to Israel, they're Jewish.
[00:18:42.626 --> 00:18:43.627]  They're also pro-Putin.
[00:18:44.628 --> 00:18:46.869]  Just absolutely asinine.
[00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:49.191]  It's like claiming Trump's anti-Israel.
[00:18:49.692 --> 00:18:50.673]  It's preposterous.
[00:18:53.135 --> 00:19:00.362]   So, He goes to other countries and told the Germans two days ago, you are responsible for a new Holocaust.
[00:19:00.903 --> 00:19:16.959]  So he has a psychological warfare program where he tailors his speech to whatever group he's talking to and tells them they've got to come to his aid with a no-fly zone and strikes on Russians that will then lead to tactical nukes and perhaps the end of the world.
[00:19:20.305 --> 00:19:38.732]  And that's what he said, he said, play the clip at the start of the show, it's up on Infowars.com, you'll see it, it's on CNN, he said, we must go to war with Russia, NATO and America must come into the fight, or, or, there'll be World War III.
[00:19:40.572 --> 00:19:42.093]  That is doublespeak right out of 1984.
[00:19:43.934 --> 00:19:46.995]  We must have nuclear war to stop nuclear war.
[00:19:48.151 --> 00:19:48.831]  That's right out of 1984.
[00:19:48.871 --> 00:19:50.092]  Here's a quote.
[00:19:50.212 --> 00:19:55.495]  Oceania was at war with Eurasia, therefore Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia.
[00:19:56.335 --> 00:20:01.878]  But then later, Oceania had never been at war with East Asia, and so it had never been at war.
[00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:05.980]  And that's how this double-think crap works.
[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:12.763]  In fact, I'm gonna get to COVID later in the broadcast, but let's play the Surgeon General who wears his little Star Trek outfit around.
[00:20:14.551 --> 00:20:19.973]  Who told us there is no such thing as natural immunity, and that only the shots can protect us when they actually erase your immunity.
[00:20:20.534 --> 00:20:23.335]  He's now been pushing for a fourth or fifth shot, so is the UK.
[00:20:23.755 --> 00:20:28.237]  Israel's moving on to its sixth shot, still has the highest COVID rates in the world because it gives you COVID.
[00:20:28.257 --> 00:20:30.558]  It's the same thing as the COVID, the spike protein.
[00:20:31.539 --> 00:20:35.340]  Here he is saying that science is always changing.
[00:20:35.841 --> 00:20:46.800]   You know, when somebody says, don't question the science, They're saying, don't question our cult, because science is questioning, and science is always learning more and changing.
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.222]  So now he's like, oh, we've changed the science.
[00:20:50.322 --> 00:20:52.543]  OK, most of the people didn't die from COVID.
[00:20:53.143 --> 00:20:55.184]  OK, yeah, the vaccines don't work that well.
[00:20:55.244 --> 00:20:56.385]  It was all an accident.
[00:20:56.805 --> 00:20:58.206]  The science changes.
[00:20:58.226 --> 00:21:00.387]  Remember, you couldn't question their science?
[00:21:01.405 --> 00:21:13.091]  Even mainstream newspapers put out quotes of the CDC head admitting that the vaccines didn't really protect people and that they lied about the numbers and that was being blocked by Twitter and Instagram this weekend!
[00:21:13.651 --> 00:21:18.834]  Even the officials admitting they lied isn't allowed by Big Tech because they haven't gotten the memo to change it.
[00:21:19.134 --> 00:21:22.296]  Absolutely incredible to watch them not even line up their propaganda.
[00:21:22.596 --> 00:21:25.597]  So here he is trying to walk back all the tyranny.
[00:21:25.777 --> 00:21:28.499]  Just a month ago he was on the news saying basically arrest anybody.
[00:21:29.676 --> 00:21:33.297]  ...or go after anybody or censor anybody that disagrees with their narrative.
[00:21:33.317 --> 00:21:33.738]  Here he is.
[00:21:34.258 --> 00:21:38.159]  ...rising in our dialogue about people being shut out in terms of their points of view being heard.
[00:21:38.179 --> 00:21:39.880]  We need to be able to hear all voices.
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.601]  We need to be able to respect one another.
[00:21:42.021 --> 00:21:46.562]  We need to be able to recognize that we may have to shift, you know, our path from time to time based on new data.
[00:21:46.582 --> 00:21:48.903]  It doesn't mean that, you know, people were wrong before.
[00:21:48.923 --> 00:21:51.024]  It just means that we've got to learn as we go.
[00:21:51.144 --> 00:21:55.426]  Because conformity is the enemy of science, as everybody is taught in science.
[00:21:55.446 --> 00:21:57.807]  I've got to move on to Dr. uh... we talked about...
[00:21:58.547 --> 00:22:00.611]  Conformity is the enemy of science.
[00:22:02.375 --> 00:22:04.017]  So they know they woke up the people.
[00:22:04.037 --> 00:22:08.661]  There was already a political alignment five years ago, a global realignment in the last five, six years.
[00:22:09.141 --> 00:22:10.282]  Nationals being elected everywhere.
[00:22:10.883 --> 00:22:11.884]  So the globalists panicked.
[00:22:11.984 --> 00:22:13.705]  They cooked up, but they already had ready.
[00:22:13.745 --> 00:22:14.406]  They released it.
[00:22:14.846 --> 00:22:16.107]  And they used that as a clamp down.
[00:22:16.127 --> 00:22:20.792]  Authoritarian countries from Australia to China to the US to Canada have been using it.
[00:22:20.892 --> 00:22:24.215]  But in the US, they don't have total election fraud in place.
[00:22:24.875 --> 00:22:28.138]  So there's a landslide of 20, 30, 40 percent like polls show.
[00:22:29.119 --> 00:22:35.301]  Overriding Democrats, they're going to lose because they don't have enough fake names and enough dead people on the voter rolls.
[00:22:35.641 --> 00:22:37.881]  So they're going to run out like they did in Texas and Florida.
[00:22:38.401 --> 00:22:44.763]  You see them surging against Republicans, beating Republicans until the voter roll numbers ran out and then the Republicans won.
[00:22:46.703 --> 00:22:52.525]  So there was such a landslide in Texas and in Florida that the Republicans barely won in 2020.
[00:22:55.262 --> 00:23:02.962]  And they don't have enough dead people and enough illegal aliens, enough people on the computer rolls to do it, because that's how they steal it, because it's hard to prove that.
[00:23:03.183 --> 00:23:04.045]  We reverse engineered it.
[00:23:05.794 --> 00:23:07.095]  They just digitally stole it.
[00:23:07.135 --> 00:23:09.358]  It can be found out because Republicans demand recounts.
[00:23:09.378 --> 00:23:11.860]  You'll see votes that don't exist that aren't attached to names.
[00:23:12.641 --> 00:23:14.523]  So they talk about, oh, Trump will be a red mirage.
[00:23:14.824 --> 00:23:15.684]  It'll look like he's winning.
[00:23:15.704 --> 00:23:20.069]  But the days and weeks after, we'll find the votes no matter what he's going.
[00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:21.951]  And so now they look at the numbers.
[00:23:21.971 --> 00:23:26.216]  There's a landslide 20, 30, 40 percent with Biden in the low 20s now.
[00:23:27.677 --> 00:23:31.320]  And Democrats in the low 30s, they're like, my God, this is beyond political realignment.
[00:23:31.521 --> 00:23:32.441]  This is total collapse.
[00:23:32.702 --> 00:23:33.302]  What are we going to do?
[00:23:33.883 --> 00:23:34.323]  Stop it.
[00:23:34.423 --> 00:23:35.224]  Back off now.
[00:23:35.324 --> 00:23:38.487]  As soon as we steal it, we'll clamp it all back down on them.
[00:23:38.507 --> 00:23:41.129]  And the documents show that in the U.S.
[00:23:41.229 --> 00:23:43.992]  and in Canada, they're bringing the lockdowns right back after the election.
[00:23:45.751 --> 00:23:47.632]  All right, Alex Jones here back live.
[00:23:47.712 --> 00:23:52.776]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us from the countryside in England.
[00:23:52.816 --> 00:23:55.398]  He's moved out of London, which he describes as dystopic.
[00:23:55.898 --> 00:23:57.780]  Hellhole, the beautiful English countryside.
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.262]  Maybe he'll tell us a bit about that coming up in a few minutes.
[00:24:00.282 --> 00:24:03.144]  But first, he's really been on top of things over at Summit.News.
[00:24:03.604 --> 00:24:23.395]  And also his great work over at Infowars.com and Newswars.com on how it's going for the foreign fighters, these foreign legions of Americans, people from the UK, a lot of people from Europe, but also different parts of the world, because he keeps writing articles with their own admissions.
[00:24:23.555 --> 00:24:36.844]   You don't see this, though, a lot of the mainstream press, that it's the foreign fighters That are actually getting a lot of the Ukrainians killed and that are allowing the Russians to find out where Zelensky's NATO-backed forces are.
[00:24:37.244 --> 00:24:39.285]  So, Paul Joseph Watson, thanks for joining us.
[00:24:39.566 --> 00:24:40.266]  Give us the latest.
[00:24:41.807 --> 00:24:42.388]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:24:42.428 --> 00:24:56.143]   Yeah, it's this weird intersection between social media, dopamine, moral exhibitionism and virtue signaling because apparently just adding a Ukrainian flag to your Twitter bio Isn't enough in 2022.
[00:24:56.203 --> 00:25:04.432]  You have to at least be there for five minutes to get the Instagram selfie before immediately coming back, hopping back across the border to Poland.
[00:25:04.933 --> 00:25:11.480]  So what we've had as of a few weeks ago, of course, Zelensky came out and called for as many foreign fighter volunteers as possible.
[00:25:11.961 --> 00:25:15.465]  There's no proper system in place to vet them whatsoever.
[00:25:16.058 --> 00:25:20.400]  Yeah, his claims, his call for foreign volunteers are amplified by the media.
[00:25:20.881 --> 00:25:32.787]  And what's happening Alex, and some of this is sneaking out in the media to some extent, a lot of it isn't, a lot of them are going there for the dopamine in their zeal, their enthusiasm to support the current thing.
[00:25:33.127 --> 00:25:36.589]  But some of them now are coming back in body bags.
[00:25:37.249 --> 00:26:04.709]   Now it's interesting because I think you played the clip last week, I played it as well, of this guy on Twitter who was describing his experience going to the border, going to the front lines, his passport being threatened with being ripped up and him sent to the front lines and being told under martial law, as a foreign volunteer, as an American, you won't be allowed to leave Ukraine until the war is over, which of course we never know when that's going to be, it could be years.
[00:26:05.313 --> 00:26:17.640]  The media then came out and did a series of hit pieces against this guy that you're seeing now, saying, oh, he's a right-wing proud boy, he's a boogaloo boy, he's a coward, he just got there, got scared, and immediately ran home again.
[00:26:18.221 --> 00:26:25.325]  Yet his story has been backed up by numerous other individuals who describe the exact same experience.
[00:26:25.785 --> 00:26:29.908]  And I'm making a video about this now, Alex, which will hopefully be out later today.
[00:26:30.689 --> 00:26:39.111]  You have another guy, a British guy, called Ben Spann, who completely abandoned his family in the United Kingdom, his teenage son and his wife.
[00:26:39.151 --> 00:26:41.151]  They didn't even know he was going to the Ukraine.
[00:26:41.631 --> 00:26:44.672]  He had no military experience, which a lot of these people don't do.
[00:26:44.692 --> 00:26:46.252]  They got no firearms training.
[00:26:46.792 --> 00:26:50.473]  He'd said he was going there to, quote, join the resistance.
[00:26:50.873 --> 00:26:53.173]  Abandoned his family, didn't even know he was going.
[00:26:53.193 --> 00:26:56.754]  They were in absolute grief and terror about what would happen to him.
[00:26:57.395 --> 00:27:07.502]  Immediately he ended up in a safe house for five days, no toilets, no running water, having AK-47s pointed at his head by a Ukrainian SWAT team.
[00:27:07.882 --> 00:27:12.505]  He now says that he realizes he'd sent himself on a suicide mission.
[00:27:13.368 --> 00:27:22.816]  And as you said in the introduction, he was more of a burden to the Ukrainian military because there's no proper system in place to vet or train them.
[00:27:23.237 --> 00:27:33.426]  Others are being told you have this volunteers for Reddit brigade, these leftist virtue signalers who wanted to impress each other on Reddit by going to fight for Ukraine.
[00:27:34.031 --> 00:27:41.939]  Well again, they were told your passports are getting confiscated, you're getting shoved onto the front lines, and you can't leave until the war is over.
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:49.567]  They're now giving away the location of training bases, Alex, in Ukraine, because they're posting their little Instagram selfies.
[00:27:49.907 --> 00:28:11.039]  The cell phone signal is going out to Russian intelligence, and they're missile striking the Ukrainian foreign fighter training facilities, because all these Reddit bros are so keen to moral exhibit a virtue signal about how they're on the front line in Ukraine, and then there's reports of them getting killed.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:21.888]   So again, Zelensky promoted it, the media amplified it, now all these virtue signalers, these literal soyjacks, in fact, I did the article earlier today, Alex.
[00:28:21.928 --> 00:28:33.426]  They can point to it there, on screen, where you have literal Call of Duty obsessive SoyJack meme type individuals tweeting about how they're going over to Ukraine.
[00:28:33.466 --> 00:28:34.348]  It's in the article.
[00:28:35.327 --> 00:28:40.290]  Which is foreign volunteers blamed for missile strike that killed 35 at Ukrainian training facility.
[00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:49.635]  Scroll down and look at one of the individuals, Callum Denby, who was in the newspaper, this is all public, but going and volunteering in Ukraine.
[00:28:50.016 --> 00:28:54.418]  He looks like the literal physical manifestation of that soy jack meme.
[00:28:54.979 --> 00:28:56.680]  He's got a pot belly like no other.
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.582]  He's been playing Call of Duty in his student years and he thinks he's combat ready.
[00:29:00.622 --> 00:29:02.503]  And Paul, I want to pull this up for TV viewers.
[00:29:02.883 --> 00:29:03.704]  Tell us where we find this?
[00:29:05.273 --> 00:29:07.776]  This is on my article posted today.
[00:29:07.856 --> 00:29:13.184]  Headline, Foreign Volunteers Blamed for Missile Strike That Killed 35- We were just showing him.
[00:29:13.224 --> 00:29:13.965]  Well, I want to be clear.
[00:29:14.025 --> 00:29:15.547]  Putin should be giving them medals.
[00:29:16.328 --> 00:29:17.850]  These guys really deserve medals.
[00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:19.932]  They're intelligence operatives for the Russians.
[00:29:20.433 --> 00:29:21.073]  And don't even know it.
[00:29:21.093 --> 00:29:27.337]  I've seen them posting on Reddit, posting on Twitter, with their geolocation, smiling, even with pink and purple hair.
[00:29:28.298 --> 00:29:29.538]  They think this is a video game.
[00:29:29.598 --> 00:29:30.019]  It's not.
[00:29:30.319 --> 00:29:42.486]  But for those that don't know, Zelensky already outlawed, before the Russians invaded, his political opposition and took over a bunch of TV and radio stations and was torturing people and attacking the eastern area that's Russian-held.
[00:29:43.066 --> 00:29:49.226]   Now he's banned the other 11 liberal groups and commandeered all media and newspapers
[00:29:49.226 --> 00:29:54.985]   and the places under martial law with armed gangs raping and killing whoever they want.
[00:29:54.985 --> 00:29:58.245]   So things have deteriorated very quickly and this is what these leftists think they're
[00:29:58.245 --> 00:29:59.245]  going into.
[00:29:59.245 --> 00:30:03.346]   I think they're going into some wonderful solidarity and World War I trench warfare
[00:30:03.346 --> 00:30:08.585]   where battle lines are drawn up against each other when this is asymmetrical fifth generational
[00:30:08.585 --> 00:30:11.665]  disintegration war.
[00:30:11.665 --> 00:30:13.665]  Well that's the other aspect of it, Alex.
[00:30:13.825 --> 00:30:16.986]  They're being fed the same propaganda that we're being fed in the West.
[00:30:17.447 --> 00:30:21.569]  By the way, I don't believe Russian propaganda, I don't believe NATO propaganda, I don't believe any of it.
[00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:26.831]  What I do know is that, God forbid you can even say this, there's propaganda on both sides.
[00:30:27.231 --> 00:30:46.802]  And the propaganda that we've been fed in the West is that Russia was supposedly supposed to take over the entire country of Ukraine in a matter of days and it was going to be a cakewalk, but actually what happened is that they're being completely decimated and defeated and it's like shooting fish in a barrel for the Ukrainian military.
[00:30:47.042 --> 00:30:48.583]  Well, that's not the case.
[00:30:49.321 --> 00:31:05.147]  But these Reddit bros, these virtue-signallers on social media, have been so naive and deluded enough to believe that line, that it's gonna be so easy that they can just get their frontline Instagram selfies and then go back home a week or two weeks later, that they're all pouring into Ukraine!
[00:31:05.467 --> 00:31:16.633]   You've got the Biden White House hiring and having meetings with TikTok influencers, Whose audience consists of 17, 18 year olds mainly, telling them to pick up the narrative.
[00:31:16.693 --> 00:31:21.516]  Maybe you should, if you really want to support the current thing, maybe you should go to Ukraine.
[00:31:21.536 --> 00:31:24.398]  We're talking about literal 17 year old TikTok people.
[00:31:24.418 --> 00:31:32.504]  Maybe Mitt Romney's son, who just like the bereavement deal with Hunter, makes all this money off Insider Deals, maybe Mitt Romney's buck-toothed son should go.
[00:31:34.238 --> 00:31:47.806]  Oh yeah, and he's got the nerve to say that Tulsi Gabbard is a traitor for even saying that Ukraine has US-run biological facilities, a fact admitted by the Biden White House by Victoria Nuland.
[00:31:48.206 --> 00:32:01.168]   Then of course, as you mentioned, you've got Zelensky, the ardent defender of democracy, the lionized saint in the West, I have a headline, President Zelensky's leadership of Ukraine's resistance is a testament to democracy.
[00:32:01.549 --> 00:32:04.211]  He's done exactly the same thing that Putin's done.
[00:32:04.631 --> 00:32:11.417]  He's nationalized the TV station so no one's allowed to criticize him on TV as he calls for a no-fly zone which would lead to...
[00:32:12.057 --> 00:32:12.738]  World War 3.
[00:32:13.238 --> 00:32:16.882]  And of course he's banned, as he said, all the opposition political parties.
[00:32:17.122 --> 00:32:21.426]  But we're being told in the West that only the West engages in the truth.
[00:32:21.906 --> 00:32:24.849]  Russia is the only outlet that engages in disinformation.
[00:32:25.009 --> 00:32:26.711]  RT, Sputnik, they're all being banned.
[00:32:26.991 --> 00:32:33.017]  Yet Zelensky is doing exactly the same thing that Putin did, but he's defending democracy, apparently.
[00:32:33.317 --> 00:32:35.157]  I want to come back, Paul, because you're a smart guy.
[00:32:35.177 --> 00:32:47.079]  I want to get your prediction or different scenarios you think are going to unfold and how this ties to the Great Reset, the collapse of the COVID narrative, where you think all of that is going and more.
[00:32:47.379 --> 00:32:49.340]  Paul Joseph Watson of Summit.News.
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:33:00.802]  On the other side, you can also read his great reports along with his brother, Steve Watson, at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, as well as see his videos daily at Band.Video, InfoWars.com.
[00:33:01.062 --> 00:33:02.202]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:33:03.697 --> 00:33:05.098]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:05.198 --> 00:33:11.141]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:33:11.582 --> 00:33:16.585]  From the vaunted Summit.News is our guest for one more segment ahead of the next hour.
[00:33:16.905 --> 00:33:21.047]  So Paul, cutting through the muddy waters, looking at the situation with Russia.
[00:33:21.327 --> 00:33:22.388]  We're now a month in.
[00:33:23.028 --> 00:33:25.250]  Obviously massive casualties on both sides.
[00:33:26.649 --> 00:33:31.209]   Obama, I always say that because that's really who the president is right now, his third term,
[00:33:31.209 --> 00:33:37.529]   Obama's puppet is going to a NATO Brussels summit. Zelensky's demanding that Biden come there.
[00:33:37.529 --> 00:33:41.929]   I would be worried that they would assassinate, that is the globalist Biden, and then blame it
[00:33:41.929 --> 00:33:48.569]   on Russia as a pretext to war, a la World War I assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.
[00:33:48.663 --> 00:33:50.262]  I don't think that's a very smart move.
[00:33:50.262 --> 00:33:54.403]   Biden's already said he won't do it, but how do the globalists grab victory
[00:33:54.403 --> 00:33:57.702]  from the jaws of defeat here with this whole situation?
[00:33:57.702 --> 00:34:04.903]   Well, domestically, they seem to be doing, Alex, what they were doing before,
[00:34:04.903 --> 00:34:10.143]   under the justification of COVID, which by the way, people, some people on the right
[00:34:10.143 --> 00:34:11.702]  have been saying this for weeks.
[00:34:11.839 --> 00:34:21.627]  Oh, the whole, it's a technocratic conspiracy to reduce living standards and centralise power and increase control over people and create a biomedical security police state.
[00:34:22.087 --> 00:34:26.631]  That was all BS, because all the Covid restrictions are being dropped, right?
[00:34:27.231 --> 00:34:28.793]  Well no, they're already coming back.
[00:34:29.341 --> 00:34:39.730]  They've got this new variant of Omicron, and again we talk about how easy it was to change the narrative from Covid to Ukraine, but it will be just as easy, Alex, to change it back.
[00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:47.257]  They've got this new variant, which again, as we said with the original Omicron variant, it was not deadly, it was mild.
[00:34:47.317 --> 00:34:54.423]  The experts in South Africa from the start said it was mild, yet all these European nations introduced further restrictions to combat it.
[00:34:54.803 --> 00:34:56.284]  We were proven right again.
[00:34:56.304 --> 00:35:03.304]   the much wanted expert, so in the UK said 4,000 people a day would die from Omicron
[00:35:03.304 --> 00:35:07.222]   were proven completely wrong. Yet they're doing the same thing with this sub-variant
[00:35:07.222 --> 00:35:11.104]   of Omicron. It's not causing significantly higher deaths or hospitalisations, we know
[00:35:11.104 --> 00:35:15.284]   those numbers are all inflated anyway, and yet they're calling for more restrictions
[00:35:15.284 --> 00:35:16.663]  and in some cases getting them.
[00:35:17.089 --> 00:35:18.750]  Austria was about to drop everything.
[00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:20.991]  They've reintroduced mask mandates.
[00:35:21.252 --> 00:35:26.715]  You've got the clamour for more restrictions slowly creeping back into the news agenda in the West.
[00:35:27.115 --> 00:35:28.756]  So this is by no means done.
[00:35:29.076 --> 00:35:37.001]  And of course they've set the precedent that this is how we're supposed to respond as compliant drones to the next pandemic.
[00:35:37.261 --> 00:35:56.888]   And then tying into Ukraine, They're already using it as an excuse to further entrench this idea that our living standards have to be permanently deflated, that the high gasoline prices, the runaway inflation, which of course was occurring months and months before Ukraine happened, is the fault of Vladimir Putin.
[00:35:57.029 --> 00:35:57.429]  It isn't.
[00:35:57.609 --> 00:36:02.270]  It's the result of them deliberately destroying our living standards.
[00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:16.117]   And you have that again today, Alex, with the billionaire-owned Bloomberg News outlet Owned of course by Michael Bloomberg, who's worth 82 billion dollars, saying that Americans should eat lentils and give up meat.
[00:36:16.197 --> 00:36:18.498]  I guess at least they're not saying they should eat bugs yet.
[00:36:19.239 --> 00:36:31.546]  And going one further by saying Americans can fight inflation, which of course is the fault of evil Vladimir Putin, because it didn't exist before he invaded Ukraine apparently, by killing their own pets!
[00:36:32.146 --> 00:36:37.069]  By saving on vets bills for chemotherapy and just letting their pets die.
[00:36:37.768 --> 00:36:48.317]  So I guess, you know, maybe if the meat prices go too high, maybe Americans can just kill their own pets and eat their own dogs like people in Venezuela do.
[00:36:48.657 --> 00:36:52.541]  And that's, you know, for the good of the environment and for the good of the economy.
[00:36:53.341 --> 00:36:56.704]  And what they're doing is introducing, they're introducing the idea of dystopia.
[00:36:56.724 --> 00:36:57.645]  The globalists admit this.
[00:36:58.045 --> 00:37:02.689]  They don't want America and the West and the Renaissance that came out of Germany and England and the U.S.
[00:37:04.032 --> 00:37:09.711]   to be an example to the world of upper mobility, they want to end the prosperity
[00:37:09.711 --> 00:37:14.112]   and collapse the first world into the third world. That's what the Great Reset is.
[00:37:14.112 --> 00:37:18.751]   That's how we continue years before to predict exactly what's happening.
[00:37:18.751 --> 00:37:23.231]   They said two years ago, after the first lockdown, we're going to have climate lockdowns.
[00:37:23.394 --> 00:37:25.736]  And now they're saying, oh, this is going to help the earth.
[00:37:25.776 --> 00:37:26.917]  This is a climate lockdown.
[00:37:27.437 --> 00:37:34.644]  Your government in the UK is talking about banning cars on Sunday to, quote, lower the price of fuel, which has nothing to do with it.
[00:37:34.664 --> 00:37:40.129]  I mean, this is pure rationing and social engineering they're introducing to us in their own words.
[00:37:42.199 --> 00:37:47.884]  Yeah, and in America they're saying you'll have to drive slower on the highway to save gasoline, to save the environment.
[00:37:48.224 --> 00:38:08.092]   Look, when this climate lockdown thing came out last year, which of course they piggybacked off of the COVID lockdown because everyone submitted and complied, they literally had legacy news media outlets like Sky News Simultaneously saying that climate lockdowns were quote fake news, didn't exist, were not even being proposed.
[00:38:08.552 --> 00:38:19.240]  The very same time Sky News came out with that article, New Delhi in India literally imposed a climate lockdown on one day where they banned all traffic.
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:23.023]  Because of air pollution to save the environment.
[00:38:23.043 --> 00:38:28.649]  So they're literally rolling it out as the news media says no one's even considering it.
[00:38:28.749 --> 00:38:41.822]  Well that's right, a year ago they first started proposing it and then now it's in the news simultaneously in the New York Times, the Washington Post and the Hill saying climate lockdowns are needed now but when we talk about it they say we're insane and it doesn't exist.
[00:38:43.618 --> 00:38:47.661]  Precisely, and then they also include it under the rubric of hate speech.
[00:38:47.721 --> 00:38:51.003]  It's now hate speech to say that climate lockdowns are happening.
[00:38:51.063 --> 00:39:21.112]   It's, of course, denial in a context of Holocaust denial to say that man-made climate change, the way that they present it, we've always had climate change throughout history, ...is not actually being driven by man, and now they include that under the Centre for Countering Digital Hate, who, when the whole climate lockdown debate emerged last year, came out and said that it was just another conspiracy theory, in the same way that anyone who questioned the lockdowns and the Covid pandemic was a conspiracy theory.
[00:39:21.532 --> 00:39:27.514]   So they're segregating all that discussion under the rubric of hate speech, to try and ban that too.
[00:39:27.514 --> 00:39:33.793]   And let's be clear, the UN, the Davos group and their front groups like Extinction Rebellion
[00:39:33.793 --> 00:39:38.474]   have said, you've written countless articles and videos, we've made films over 20 years,
[00:39:38.474 --> 00:39:41.753]   Paul and I have been working together 20 years now, over 20 now.
[00:39:42.127 --> 00:39:52.249]  Coming out and saying we must reintroduce rationing and use smartphones and AI to track the rationing to create a new serfdom to control people by keeping them poor.
[00:39:52.269 --> 00:39:55.150]  This has nothing to do with the environment, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:55.470 --> 00:40:00.171]  Taxing cow farts is about controlling you and running your life.
[00:40:00.591 --> 00:40:02.432]  Methane is good in the atmosphere.
[00:40:02.772 --> 00:40:08.153]  It created the greenhouse effect so that we would trap heat on the planet and build an atmosphere.
[00:40:12.372 --> 00:40:15.974]  Yeah, and then you look at the COP26 menu in Scotland last year.
[00:40:16.455 --> 00:40:17.395]  Basically all meat.
[00:40:17.435 --> 00:40:20.057]  You look at the menu for the Davos elitists, all meat.
[00:40:20.517 --> 00:40:38.485]   Again, they want to create this global reset system, this great reset, where they're still able to afford to live in the big cities, the middle class is completely eviscerated, and basically the only thing that exists is a servant class of immigrants who have No allegiance to the country.
[00:40:38.926 --> 00:40:43.473]  They only have a community with their own people from the same country.
[00:40:43.814 --> 00:40:45.537]  There's no actual community.
[00:40:45.657 --> 00:40:51.967]  Everybody's being atomized who lives in giant tower blocks in big cities, which is one of the reasons I moved out recently of London.
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:54.341]  So that's what they want, the elite.
[00:40:54.701 --> 00:41:00.203]  They want their atomized society where nobody talks to their neighbor, nobody has a decent standard of living.
[00:41:00.523 --> 00:41:06.985]  The only people who are allowed to live in those cities are the migrant wage slave class that serve the elite.
[00:41:07.085 --> 00:41:10.546]  That's what they want, and that's what this reduction of living standards is about.
[00:41:10.586 --> 00:41:15.288]  Whether it's via COVID lockdowns or Ukraine, it's the same agenda.
[00:41:15.928 --> 00:41:20.630]  Paul, they're training us to live with absurdity so we live under their absurd tyranny.
[00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:27.180]   In closing, How do you think they're able to navigate the situation in Russia?
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:28.762]  Because Putin's not going to back down.
[00:41:29.663 --> 00:41:31.065]  The quagmire is getting deeper.
[00:41:31.746 --> 00:41:37.392]  Americans aren't seeing Putin's enemies as good guys either.
[00:41:38.113 --> 00:41:40.035]  Biden's approval rating is all-time lows.
[00:41:40.816 --> 00:41:42.098]  Where do you see this ending?
[00:41:45.205 --> 00:41:47.547]  Again, I don't believe any of the propaganda on either side.
[00:41:47.567 --> 00:41:48.968]  I don't know where it's gonna go.
[00:41:49.208 --> 00:41:50.249]  What concerns me?
[00:41:50.629 --> 00:41:53.992]  I mean, if I was in Ukraine, obviously I was getting shelled by the Russians.
[00:41:54.512 --> 00:41:59.716]  I would think that Vladimir Putin was the biggest threat, that he was the main danger.
[00:41:59.737 --> 00:42:01.978]  I would be terrified of Vladimir Putin.
[00:42:02.359 --> 00:42:03.700]  But I'm not from Ukraine.
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:06.362]  My interests lie in my country, in the West.
[00:42:06.942 --> 00:42:11.526]   I'm more terrified of Zelensky than Putin at this moment.
[00:42:11.586 --> 00:42:24.895]  Because again, he came out yesterday and said, if Ukraine doesn't get everything it wants in peace talks, which is the very nature of diplomatic talks, you never get everything that you want, then that's going to lead to World War 3.
[00:42:25.396 --> 00:42:35.102]  He's called for the no-fly zone already, but now he's saying if we don't get everything, if Putin doesn't back down on everything, we're going to get World War 3.
[00:42:35.162 --> 00:42:40.526]   That's why I'm more terrified of Zelensky in a global context Than I am of Putin.
[00:42:40.806 --> 00:42:58.191]  But again, what's going to happen is more people are going to be deluded, more people are going to be naive, they're going to be brainwashed into believing narratives that are harmful to themselves, while being presented with them in this sense of moral exhibitionism, virtue signalling, like that's the most important thing in the world.
[00:42:58.631 --> 00:43:08.054]  Similar thing with the Ukrainian refugees, a third of them coming into Europe are from other countries, they're abusing the system once again, so people are getting hurt and deluded in that context.
[00:43:08.962 --> 00:43:14.486]  The only thing we can hope for, Alex, is to pray for peace and for pray for calmer heads on both sides.
[00:43:14.526 --> 00:43:17.928]  But as you said, that looks like a distinct impossibility.
[00:43:17.948 --> 00:43:18.628]  All right.
[00:43:18.768 --> 00:43:20.229]  What fourth hour are you hosting this week?
[00:43:20.269 --> 00:43:20.870]  Is it Thursday?
[00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:22.551]  Thursday, yeah.
[00:43:22.891 --> 00:43:23.712]  Fourth hour, Thursday.
[00:43:23.732 --> 00:43:27.194]  I'm sure we'll be talking about all the transgenders winning all the women's sports.
[00:43:27.254 --> 00:43:27.794]  It's incredible.
[00:43:28.275 --> 00:43:29.095]  Summit.News.
[00:43:29.175 --> 00:43:30.316]  Thank you, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:43:31.236 --> 00:43:31.737]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:43:32.077 --> 00:43:33.516]  Hour number two straight ahead.
[00:43:33.516 --> 00:43:45.596]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022.
[00:43:46.224 --> 00:44:04.915]  And in the month of February, we had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product, X3, that has all three types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity in your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much.
[00:44:05.035 --> 00:44:08.637]  And the majority of the population in the world is iodine deficient.
[00:44:08.657 --> 00:44:10.378]  This is the very best iodine out there.
[00:44:10.538 --> 00:44:14.599]  So, we had it on sale at 50% off, but we sold more than half of what we have.
[00:44:15.079 --> 00:44:18.980]  More isn't going to come in for a long time, so I took it back to full price.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.280]  And I was just thinking, you know what?
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.501]  We need the funds in now to stay on air.
[00:44:22.901 --> 00:44:24.821]  Plus, this is a great product everybody needs.
[00:44:25.302 --> 00:44:34.384]  So to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get X3 and experience it for yourself and support the broadcast, I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out.
[00:44:34.844 --> 00:44:38.205]  Get X3 right now exclusively at Infowarestore.com for 50% off.
[00:44:40.811 --> 00:44:42.772]  Alright folks, here's the deal.
[00:44:43.873 --> 00:44:52.518]  I was on a couple shows this morning, and each time I mentioned that Peter Daszak and Bill Gates were involved in the Ukraine labs, they got blown away and didn't believe it.
[00:44:53.459 --> 00:44:56.221]  I thought, wait a minute, I've read that, I know that, it's in documentaries, it's on record.
[00:44:56.241 --> 00:44:59.603]  And then I went and looked online and no one has written a new article about it.
[00:45:00.558 --> 00:45:05.801]  But I've got a big stack of documents and news articles where it's on record before COVID that he was doing it.
[00:45:06.241 --> 00:45:14.585]  So that's going to be some big news when people figure out the same folks running the Wuhan lab were running those and it ties into Bill Gates and the usual suspects.
[00:45:14.605 --> 00:45:15.305]  So that's coming up.
[00:45:16.286 --> 00:45:20.328]  The announcement of kill your dog, kill your cat, save the earth and stop Putin.
[00:45:20.348 --> 00:45:21.028]  I'm not joking.
[00:45:21.068 --> 00:45:21.829]  It's mainstream news.
[00:45:22.049 --> 00:45:25.551]  That is all coming up as well.
[00:45:25.611 --> 00:45:42.422]   But first, I want our listeners to be healthy and happy, and I want to sell you products that I know are amazing so that you get great results, so you're happy with me, and so you come back again and buy products and keep us on air.
[00:45:43.479 --> 00:45:44.640]  It's a symbiotic relationship.
[00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:55.806]  It's like if I ran a restaurant, I want it to be a clean kitchen with really great food and great service and a family atmosphere so you'd come back and that your grandkids 50 years later would be coming there.
[00:45:56.146 --> 00:45:57.567]  That's the type of guy I am.
[00:45:57.647 --> 00:45:59.308]  I want a long-term relationship with you.
[00:45:59.688 --> 00:46:03.651]  Doesn't mean I'm perfect, doesn't mean I have all the answers, but I have goodwill for you.
[00:46:03.971 --> 00:46:05.151]  I know you've got goodwill for me.
[00:46:06.889 --> 00:46:09.610]  I was looking at our different products that are great for your immune system.
[00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:17.454]  X2, X3, Vitamin D3 gummies, and Winter Sun, and some of the other great products that are amazing at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:46:18.694 --> 00:46:25.697]   But then I went out to our herbal tincture supplier who is the biggest top name in the
[00:46:25.697 --> 00:46:29.226]   country, but obviously they can't say they work with us, but they'll get death threats and bomb
[00:46:29.226 --> 00:46:32.486]   threats and you know even the New York Times has attacked them and tried to act like they're bad
[00:46:32.486 --> 00:46:38.316]   on the rest of it. They're great people and they still make a large part of our products,
[00:46:38.316 --> 00:46:45.606]   the tinctures. They use the best source, the highest source, and cold pressed, which takes three or
[00:46:45.606 --> 00:46:50.257]   four times on average with the herb to get you the same amount of liquids.
[00:46:49.949 --> 00:46:54.511]  So you're not getting something watered down, you're getting something extremely pure.
[00:46:55.311 --> 00:47:00.853]  And so all the products we're selling are great for your immune system and your body in the supplement department.
[00:47:01.534 --> 00:47:21.232]   But I asked them a year ago, and then just time flew and they had problems in getting all the ingredients, to give me a wild-crafted organic High-end booster for immune systems for adults, for old people, for brown-skinned folks particularly, who don't get as much sun, and for children.
[00:47:22.012 --> 00:47:22.773]  This is for me.
[00:47:22.993 --> 00:47:23.834]  It's for my daughter.
[00:47:23.934 --> 00:47:25.795]  It's for my son, my daughters and son.
[00:47:27.267 --> 00:47:30.088]  This is what I'm going to be using in my household.
[00:47:30.248 --> 00:47:35.030]  So, introducing, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Support from Infowarslife.com.
[00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:36.791]  It's our newest product.
[00:47:37.371 --> 00:47:38.211]  It's out of the gates.
[00:47:38.451 --> 00:47:39.532]  It's a limited run.
[00:47:39.952 --> 00:47:51.316]  It has the highest in elderberry, highest in quality echinacea, highest in quality astragalus root, the very best angelica root, Lomatium root, and more.
[00:47:51.496 --> 00:47:58.401]   And it is extremely concentrated This is what you put under your tongue,
[00:47:58.401 --> 00:48:02.301]   let it sit there for about a minute, it doesn't taste bad, and then swallow it.
[00:48:02.301 --> 00:48:06.441]   And you should take this, in my view, every night when you go to bed,
[00:48:06.441 --> 00:48:10.301]   so it can get into your cells and your body, and it is amazing.
[00:48:10.301 --> 00:48:17.061]   You need to go read about the ingredients it's got, and then get the other great products
[00:48:17.061 --> 00:48:21.141]   at infowarestore.com as well, like Bio-True Selenium from the mustard seed,

[00:48:53.307 --> 00:48:54.728]  Nobody else I know has those.
[00:48:54.748 --> 00:48:56.029]  It's got the high-end type in it.
[00:48:56.610 --> 00:48:59.433]  That is so good for your whole body and all electrochemical activities as well.
[00:48:59.733 --> 00:49:01.295]  These are all really great products.
[00:49:01.875 --> 00:49:03.257]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:49:03.297 --> 00:49:06.921]  The Physiomagnesium has been sold out for over eight months because of supply chain breakdowns.
[00:49:07.301 --> 00:49:08.322]  It's now back in stock.
[00:49:08.722 --> 00:49:11.846]  Infowarslife.com to order or 888-253-3139.
[00:49:12.546 --> 00:49:17.932]  I want to thank you for all your support and keeping us on air throughout the years.
[00:49:18.893 --> 00:49:19.714]  Now, we're going to go to break.
[00:49:21.561 --> 00:49:27.065]  And this next subject is so incredible that I'm just going to have trouble not getting pissed off, but I'm going to do the best job I can.
[00:49:27.105 --> 00:49:29.287]  But they are openly saying, kill your dogs and cats now.
[00:49:29.827 --> 00:49:32.430]  I told you folks, which is another word for your children.
[00:49:34.451 --> 00:49:41.236]  What does Klaus Schwab and the UN and the Davos Group mean by, you'll own nothing, you'll have nothing, and you'll like it?
[00:49:42.557 --> 00:49:50.744]  What do they mean by all their public announcements in movies and TV everywhere that you're going to eat bugs and you're not going to get any type of meat anymore?
[00:49:53.985 --> 00:49:57.187]  What does it mean when they tell you you're not going to have a car anymore, not even electric cars?
[00:49:58.248 --> 00:50:02.290]  They're selling you on dystopia.
[00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:04.732]  They're destroying civilization.
[00:50:04.772 --> 00:50:12.177]  They're reversing the renaissance that built all this incredible technology and medicine and science and literature.
[00:50:13.783 --> 00:50:21.548]  They are waging war against it, and they're waging war against the human family of men and women who are the species.
[00:50:22.028 --> 00:50:23.269]  A man is not the species.
[00:50:23.689 --> 00:50:24.950]  A woman is not the species.
[00:50:25.631 --> 00:50:26.751]  We are the species.
[00:50:26.791 --> 00:50:27.932]  We are inseparable.
[00:50:28.733 --> 00:50:30.654]  We are connected eternally.
[00:50:32.715 --> 00:50:39.520]  And so in the attack on humanity, there's an attack on all life on the planet, a globalist attempt to take over all carbon-based life forms.
[00:50:40.512 --> 00:50:51.160]  In the transhumanist screeds of the UN and the Davos Group, they say they're going to create new life that through survival of the fittest will dominate and erase all life on Earth as we know it.
[00:50:52.341 --> 00:51:03.592]   So when you hear the left and the globalists and all their different high priests saying the end of the human era is here, humans will be extinct by 2045, Population reduction of 90% by 2030.
[00:51:04.373 --> 00:51:07.376]  You now see how they're going to get you there very quickly.
[00:51:07.476 --> 00:51:14.903]  Famine, lockdowns, wars, starvation, where they pose as the saviors the whole time.
[00:51:15.484 --> 00:51:17.746]  Believing you have such horrible Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:22.382]  You can't believe they're doing it to you because that would be too frightening.
[00:51:22.922 --> 00:51:26.765]  So you shift into Stockholm Syndrome and submit to your abusers.
[00:51:26.825 --> 00:51:31.768]  You must shift out of the Stockholm Syndrome and realize resistance is life.
[00:51:32.188 --> 00:51:33.529]  Resistance is victory.
[00:51:33.929 --> 00:51:35.070]  Submission is death.
[00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:37.311]  Submission is humiliation.
[00:51:38.432 --> 00:51:42.414]  Submission is the end of the species as we know it.
[00:51:43.717 --> 00:51:44.678]  There's a few articles.
[00:51:45.458 --> 00:51:46.840]  Men's Journal has a good one.
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:48.661]  There's one out of the Smithsonian.
[00:51:50.242 --> 00:51:51.343]  Men and dogs.
[00:51:51.483 --> 00:51:55.307]  What's behind our 26,000 year partnership?
[00:51:55.347 --> 00:51:59.390]  Now whether you believe that number or not, the point is dogs came from wolves, bred by us.
[00:52:00.491 --> 00:52:10.840]  It turns out in major studies they're more attuned to what we do now than they are to other dogs, especially with like labs and spaniels and things like that.
[00:52:11.854 --> 00:52:12.715]  There's studies out on it.
[00:52:12.735 --> 00:52:13.556]  Here's Smithsonian.
[00:52:14.697 --> 00:52:26.492]  A new study finds very young dogs with little human contact can understand pointing gestures and much more because they have been already trained epigenetically by humans with their deep relationship.
[00:52:27.253 --> 00:52:40.482]  Well, if the cult can get between men and women and our children and tell us they're going to sterilize our children and that, you know, six-foot-four men with giant penises can become, you know, champion swimmers against the women, well, then they can do anything.
[00:52:41.102 --> 00:52:48.187]  If they can make us accept convicted pedophiles at Drag Queen Storytime with five-year-olds bouncing on their laps, we will accept anything.
[00:52:49.648 --> 00:52:50.869]  I want to play a short clip.
[00:52:51.049 --> 00:52:55.212]  This is aired on British television as a public service announcement.
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:57.842]  And this is from three years ago.
[00:52:57.862 --> 00:53:04.411]  And they've got new reports out too saying, oh, your carbon footprint, get rid of your dog, get rid of your cat.
[00:53:04.851 --> 00:53:10.539]  Your cat has a bigger carbon footprint than a car because it eats meat and meat eating is bad.
[00:53:12.213 --> 00:53:14.213]  Carbon's part of the cycle on this planet.
[00:53:14.994 --> 00:53:16.074]  It's part of the fertilizer.
[00:53:16.114 --> 00:53:17.054]  It's part of everything.
[00:53:17.714 --> 00:53:22.195]  And the carbon we take out of the ground and put back in the atmosphere was making the atmosphere richer and better.
[00:53:22.495 --> 00:53:26.556]  Our atmosphere was very thin compared to a million years ago, or 25 million years ago.
[00:53:26.596 --> 00:53:27.257]  That's not debated.
[00:53:28.777 --> 00:53:32.618]  Oxygen and carbon dioxide are trace gases that have been much higher previously.
[00:53:33.838 --> 00:53:42.088]   We live in a carbon-deprived environment, and it's Literally, biblical, that we're now mining it out of the earth and terraforming the planet.
[00:53:42.348 --> 00:53:43.869]  The globalists want that ended.
[00:53:45.229 --> 00:53:50.150]  They want carbon shut down and they've trained people religiously to hate carbon when carbon is life-giving.
[00:53:51.611 --> 00:53:53.631]  And now they come for our pets.
[00:53:53.812 --> 00:54:02.274]  Billionaire-owned Bloomberg says Americans should eat lentils and let their pets die to cope with inflation.
[00:54:06.189 --> 00:54:14.475]  They go on to say, don't give them medical treatment, euthanize them for the earth, and eat lentils, and drive less, and lower the speed limits.
[00:54:15.355 --> 00:54:16.196]  They're screwing you.
[00:54:17.156 --> 00:54:17.977]  They're robbing you.
[00:54:18.637 --> 00:54:21.299]  And they also say raise taxes, the Democrats are proposing.
[00:54:24.401 --> 00:54:27.523]  Biden is proposing raising gas taxes to lower prices.
[00:54:27.563 --> 00:54:29.725]  That would actually, of course, increase prices.
[00:54:32.611 --> 00:54:33.253]  Take the bus.
[00:54:33.333 --> 00:54:34.155]  Don't buy in bulk.
[00:54:34.175 --> 00:54:35.720]  You actually save money by buying in bulk.
[00:54:36.201 --> 00:54:37.464]  Try lentils instead of meat.
[00:54:37.585 --> 00:54:39.349]  Nobody said this would be fun.
[00:54:40.832 --> 00:54:41.333]  Oh, really?
[00:54:41.473 --> 00:54:42.814]  Klaus Schwab said we would like it.
[00:54:43.534 --> 00:54:54.763]  That's how we chronicle and forecast what's coming, because we research it and we understand that Larry Fink runs the whole show, and he said he's going to starve you out and then make you submit to his social system.
[00:54:55.283 --> 00:55:02.369]  Bloomberg reports, from the great resignation to lying flat, workers are opting out while they get replaced by foreign workers.
[00:55:02.989 --> 00:55:05.151]  They think they're part of a revolution of laziness.
[00:55:05.651 --> 00:55:07.393]  They're being made obsolete.
[00:55:08.013 --> 00:55:11.697]  All of this extremely, incredibly predatory.
[00:55:12.398 --> 00:55:17.504]  So here's British television with a public service announcement about getting rid of your animals.
[00:55:18.732 --> 00:55:19.972]  We're a nation of pet lovers.
[00:55:20.072 --> 00:55:21.373]  More than half of us have one.
[00:55:21.713 --> 00:55:24.993]  But did you know our furry friends are contributing to climate change?
[00:55:25.493 --> 00:55:32.315]  Some researchers have found the eco-pawprint of a dog is twice that of a typical SUV driven for 6,000 miles a year.
[00:55:32.835 --> 00:55:39.376]  The food for one pet pooch emits nearly twice as much carbon the average UK household uses in a year for electricity.
[00:55:40.076 --> 00:55:47.278]  And according to research by the Victoria University in Wellington, a cat's eco-footprint is roughly the same as a small car.
[00:55:48.098 --> 00:55:51.959]  Cat litter is also full of mineral-based products which are harmful to the environment.
[00:55:52.299 --> 00:55:56.381]  And the growing demand for plastic toys also contributes to environmental damage.
[00:55:56.861 --> 00:55:58.562]  But it's not just our pets.
[00:55:59.042 --> 00:56:03.063]  A single cow produces up to 120 kilograms of methane per year.
[00:56:03.503 --> 00:56:06.424]  And there's around 1.5 billion cattle worldwide.
[00:56:06.824 --> 00:56:11.966]  And it's this methane that's more damaging to our climate than the carbon dioxide produced by cars.
[00:56:12.446 --> 00:56:16.428]  So, is it time that we give up our pets in order to save our planet?
[00:56:18.311 --> 00:56:20.452]  And now they cut right to the chase and just say, kill them.
[00:56:20.492 --> 00:56:24.113]  See, animals, dogs and cats are a metaphor for children.
[00:56:24.653 --> 00:56:29.654]  We already abort our children, now they're saying, I got bills introduced to keep babies alive 26 weeks after they're born.
[00:56:31.095 --> 00:56:34.476]  They must get you to go against your own will, your own common sense.
[00:56:34.496 --> 00:56:38.417]   You know, cults A lot of cults make you kill your animal when you join.
[00:56:38.918 --> 00:56:54.532]  The Nazis would make the SS officers, when they were in training, in their officer training schools, they would make them raise a German Shepherd for a year and then strangle it to death to prove themselves, to prove we'll take the deadly shot.
[00:56:55.782 --> 00:57:07.750]  We'll suspend our own common sense, we'll do whatever you say, and we won't research the carbon cycle of carbon dioxide, oxygen, water, and sunlight on this planet.
[00:57:10.052 --> 00:57:11.433]  Dogs, cats, and climate change.
[00:57:11.473 --> 00:57:13.154]  What your pet's carbon footprint.
[00:57:13.475 --> 00:57:14.495]  Forbes, get rid of them.
[00:57:14.956 --> 00:57:18.178]  By owning a pet, you're doing more damage to the environment than you might realize.
[00:57:18.578 --> 00:57:21.040]  Oh, is your family pet bad to the environment?
[00:57:22.526 --> 00:57:27.772]  And all these articles about, get rid of your dogs, and then it moves right to, science proves kids are bad for the earth.
[00:57:29.554 --> 00:57:32.357]  Morality suggests we stop having them.
[00:57:34.045 --> 00:57:34.885]  You are bad!
[00:57:35.045 --> 00:57:35.945]  Life is bad!
[00:57:36.205 --> 00:57:42.447]  Ladies and gentlemen, there were just as many buffalo, tens of millions of them, that's estimated that there are cows today in the U.S.
[00:57:42.487 --> 00:57:48.628]  It's the exact same animal, eating grass, creating fertilizer for the rest of the life, putting gases in the atmosphere.
[00:57:48.668 --> 00:57:49.668]  That's the life cycle.
[00:57:49.908 --> 00:57:51.489]  But they're training you that you're bad.
[00:57:52.329 --> 00:57:56.570]  Oh, but nuclear reactors aren't, and GMO isn't, and nanotech isn't.
[00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:57.850]  Oh no, that's all fine.
[00:57:58.786 --> 00:58:01.887]  Climate change is making people think twice about having children.
[00:58:02.527 --> 00:58:05.868]  The critics and the ethics of having children in the age of climate.
[00:58:06.208 --> 00:58:09.929]  And it goes on and on and on and on and on.
[00:58:10.229 --> 00:58:11.190]  Don't have children.
[00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:11.770]  You're bad.
[00:58:12.010 --> 00:58:13.670]  Your normal biological action's bad.
[00:58:14.671 --> 00:58:16.331]  Our pet's gobbling up the planet.
[00:58:16.371 --> 00:58:18.412]  Look, now they're evil devils that have got to be killed.
[00:58:19.636 --> 00:58:27.804]  But of course in the interim you can pay them and be registered and jump through hoops and do carbon offsets and then, then you can do it.
[00:58:28.024 --> 00:58:32.068]  Daily Mail, environmental campaigner who says owning pets is selfish and cruel.
[00:58:32.548 --> 00:58:34.009]  Only they are the good guys.
[00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:45.035]  And while you're busy hearing you've got to get rid of your dog or cat to save the Earth, the climate lockdowns and now the new grain shortages are going to kill tens of millions more people in Africa.
[00:58:45.335 --> 00:58:49.376]  But wink, wink, leftists think if they kill people it's a non-zero-sum game.
[00:58:49.697 --> 00:58:51.057]  It's a zero-sum game to them.
[00:58:51.477 --> 00:58:54.119]  They believe that they get richer by killing people.
[00:58:54.339 --> 00:59:16.208]   And the average leftist is actually a hypocritical, lying, devil-worshiping, greedy scumbag that signed on with the globalists as if they'll be part So, back to the idea that the state would seek to define your morality, it requires an array of tools to do that.
[00:59:17.528 --> 00:59:21.469]   When you look at fascism, As opposed to communism.
[00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:27.474]  The distinction, so the communists would want to seize the means of production and have the state own all of them.
[00:59:27.554 --> 00:59:30.476]  Fascism is that partnership you spoke of.
[00:59:31.637 --> 00:59:33.898]  So a better word for fascism is actually corporatism.
[00:59:34.739 --> 00:59:36.900]  It's the merger of state and corporate power.
[00:59:37.601 --> 00:59:45.646]  But rather than the state seizing the means of production, it begins a partnership with corporates for the purposes of profit.
[00:59:46.827 --> 00:59:50.531]  And that's what we began witnessing happening under the COVID period.
[00:59:51.912 --> 00:59:58.118]  Huge, powerful, some of the wealthiest companies on the planet, big tech companies, big pharmaceutical companies, Pfizer, right?
[00:59:58.618 --> 01:00:08.648]  If you were to look up who paid the largest criminal fine in history, the results that pop up is Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline, two big pharmaceuticals.
[01:00:10.134 --> 01:00:16.840]  The assumption that these companies, and Violation Tracker, you can go to the website, it lists all of the fines, fraud and all of this stuff that they've had to pay.
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:19.342]  Huge fines, huge, largest fines that you find.
[01:00:19.683 --> 01:00:25.948]  The assumption that these companies exist for your benefit is one that really must be interrogated.
[01:00:26.048 --> 01:00:28.751]  They exist for profit and you are the product.
[01:00:29.091 --> 01:00:32.214]  You are the thing that needs to be exploited for the purposes of profit.
[01:00:32.975 --> 01:00:52.497]   So when the state began a partnership with these corporates I took the view that during the COVID mandate period in particular, our states, whether it's here in the US, in the United Kingdom, were no longer serving their people, but rather they were serving vested interests for the purposes of maximizing profit.
[01:00:53.177 --> 01:00:53.917]  That's fascism.
[01:00:54.878 --> 01:00:55.858]  That's what Mussolini did.
[01:00:56.959 --> 01:01:02.301]  And it's how you utilize industry for the purposes of maximizing profit to deliver a certain goal.
[01:01:02.461 --> 01:01:05.122]  And in that process, people are simply cogs in the wheel.
[01:01:05.962 --> 01:01:07.163]  The individual no longer matters.
[01:01:08.264 --> 01:01:10.326]  And it's incredibly dangerous.
[01:01:11.707 --> 01:01:20.894]  And again, if you don't have that spiritual grounding, then there's a void and that void is filled by the state.
[01:01:21.514 --> 01:01:23.656]  And your morality then gets defined by the state.
[01:01:27.031 --> 01:01:35.472]  Majid Nawaz, I've known about him for years, former radical Muslim, now basically a Western slash, as you can say, Christian convert.
[01:01:36.353 --> 01:01:40.953]  But the point is, is that he's probably the most articulate person out there.
[01:01:41.614 --> 01:01:46.234]  Every time I see him talking about COVID, but politics in general, and I really want to get him on the show.
[01:01:46.254 --> 01:01:49.835]  I was amazed when he was on Joe Rogan, watched the whole thing a few months ago.
[01:01:50.895 --> 01:01:54.876]  And the only other person I know that's as articulate is Laura Logan.
[01:01:55.713 --> 01:01:59.713]   It was just incredible the way she breaks things down and describes them.
[01:01:59.713 --> 01:02:02.713]  We're very, very blessed to have people like that.
[01:02:02.713 --> 01:02:07.713]   Another great person that we have is Dr. Ben Marble, who runs MyFreeDoctor.com.
[01:02:07.713 --> 01:02:11.713]   He's helped tens of thousands upon tens of thousands of people that would have died
[01:02:11.713 --> 01:02:17.713]   when their doctors and their pharmacists were not prescribing things that do save people.
[01:02:17.713 --> 01:02:20.713]   And the studies are all out on that now, and he did it basically at cost,
[01:02:20.713 --> 01:02:23.713]  or a lot of times for free, at MyFreeDoctor.com.
[01:02:23.484 --> 01:02:27.288]  He's not a sponsor but I'm promoting him because of the great work he's doing.
[01:02:27.308 --> 01:02:40.019]   I wanted to get him to town to come on the shows and just do some rounds here because boy have we not been vindicated with COVID being exposed as a period, as a power grab, as a Criminal movement.
[01:02:40.199 --> 01:02:41.901]  And again, you're a medical doctor.
[01:02:42.581 --> 01:02:45.884]  You're now a leading telehealth provider in all 50 states.
[01:02:46.404 --> 01:02:53.650]  You created MyFreeDoctor.com at the beginning of the pandemic to save lives by providing accessible, affordable, and effective health care to everyone.
[01:02:54.090 --> 01:02:57.533]  Just like the website name states, the telehealth visits are free.
[01:02:57.853 --> 01:02:59.534]  The services is purely donation based.
[01:02:59.975 --> 01:03:11.542]   If you suspect you may be getting ill, especially from COVID-19, do not delay Head to MyFreeDoctor.com to get access to a licensed doctor who can provide care for you and access to effective treatments for diseases.
[01:03:11.602 --> 01:03:13.123]  MyFreeDoctor.com.
[01:03:14.203 --> 01:03:24.249]  Now that we've seen all this come out, now that we've seen it confirmed they made it in a lab, confirmed they suppressed treatments, confirmed they lied about real death numbers with COVID, and then now the death numbers from the vaccine.
[01:03:24.309 --> 01:03:27.270]  I'll go over some of those slides and documents I've got here.
[01:03:28.131 --> 01:03:29.872]  How angry does this make you?
[01:03:30.632 --> 01:03:31.612]  Where do you see this going?
[01:03:31.632 --> 01:03:36.354]  Because they want to kind of pull back from the lockdowns around the world, but they admit their own documents that we've covered here.
[01:03:36.695 --> 01:03:37.895]  Fauci even admitted it on TV last week.
[01:03:37.915 --> 01:03:39.556]  They're going to bring them back after the midterms.
[01:03:39.976 --> 01:03:41.657]  But they know they pushed the public too far.
[01:03:41.937 --> 01:03:43.477]  So now we're awake and angry and pushing back.
[01:03:43.778 --> 01:03:44.918]  Now they want to go away.
[01:03:44.938 --> 01:03:49.780]  And the Washington Post is saying, how dare the main political movement be anti-lockdown, anti-mask?
[01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:50.921]  We're getting rid of it.
[01:03:51.181 --> 01:03:52.301]  No, no, we know you did it.
[01:03:52.341 --> 01:03:53.642]  We know it's part of Klaus Schwab.
[01:03:53.922 --> 01:03:55.122]  We know it's about the New World Order.
[01:03:55.422 --> 01:04:06.989]   So the New World Order's attempt to use this biomedical freakout And power grab to make trillions of dollars and kill a bunch of us is backfiring, but how do we make sure it continues to backfire and they get brought to justice?
[01:04:07.009 --> 01:04:18.177]  Because it got picked up by National News and Media Matters when you were a guest and you said, look, I'm not going to kill anybody and I'm not saying go out and kill these people, but I think the people that created the virus and released it should be executed.
[01:04:18.517 --> 01:04:20.379]  And I said, well, after a jury of their peers.
[01:04:20.479 --> 01:04:26.824]   And I mean, seriously, I do believe Fauci, before he did with the HIV stuff, Uh, you know, deserves a death penalty.
[01:04:27.004 --> 01:04:27.946]  Don't kill him, folks.
[01:04:28.306 --> 01:04:29.247]  He needs to be arrested.
[01:04:29.428 --> 01:04:30.529]  And I think we can get to that point.
[01:04:30.549 --> 01:04:32.171]  And I think Bill Gates deserves to go to prison.
[01:04:32.411 --> 01:04:34.494]  His wife's divorcing him and saying he's bad now over it.
[01:04:34.855 --> 01:04:37.378]  And I think Peter Daszak needs to go to prison for what he did.
[01:04:37.418 --> 01:04:40.001]  Now we learn he's heavily involved in the labs overseas.
[01:04:40.021 --> 01:04:41.944]  So, so, I'm ranting here, sir.
[01:04:42.264 --> 01:04:43.145]  It's really great to have you.
[01:04:43.726 --> 01:04:44.447]  Great to be here.
[01:04:44.687 --> 01:04:46.188]  Appreciate you having me back.
[01:04:47.008 --> 01:04:48.429]  Certainly, I agree with everything you said.
[01:04:48.489 --> 01:04:50.891]  You know, where to begin?
[01:04:50.911 --> 01:04:56.815]  There's so much, the level of evil that's going on globally is just astronomical with everything that's going on.
[01:04:56.875 --> 01:04:59.177]  We have to hold these evildoers accountable.
[01:04:59.997 --> 01:05:06.041]  So, how to make that happen is the big, you know, the billion dollar question, or the trillion dollar question.
[01:05:07.162 --> 01:05:20.531]   You know, when everything's corrupt and the World Economic Forum has bribed all the courts and all the systems and Around the world, that's the great question that remains to be answered, is how do we hold these people accountable?
[01:05:20.571 --> 01:05:21.711]  We know everything they did.
[01:05:22.071 --> 01:05:26.814]  We know Fauci, Dr. Death, Fauci funded the creation, the gain-of-function research in Wuhan.
[01:05:27.195 --> 01:05:30.116]  We know he created this Frankenstein virus.
[01:05:30.176 --> 01:05:31.237]  It's a man-made virus.
[01:05:31.856 --> 01:05:37.695]   He put together parts of SARS-1 with parts of RSV with parts of HIV and then put the
[01:05:37.695 --> 01:05:42.657]   spike protein poison bioterror weapon on top of it all combined together.
[01:05:42.657 --> 01:05:44.257]  That's why I call it a Frankenstein virus.
[01:05:44.257 --> 01:05:46.637]  COVID-19 into COVID-19.
[01:05:46.637 --> 01:05:49.777]  So he paid for that and funded it.
[01:05:49.777 --> 01:05:54.056]  So basically every COVID death is a murder by Dr. Death Fauci.
[01:05:54.056 --> 01:05:57.576]   So that's why I say he's the greatest mass murderer in history or the world.
[01:05:57.576 --> 01:06:01.056]   Now the problem is they've already given five billion doses of this poison.
[01:06:01.119 --> 01:06:01.860]  We know it's poison.
[01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:02.921]  Everybody knows it's poison.
[01:06:03.301 --> 01:06:11.226]  Everybody knows somebody, a friend or family member that's had a heart attack or a stroke or a blood clot by now that so many doses have been delivered.
[01:06:11.627 --> 01:06:13.588]  So how do we put a stop to this?
[01:06:13.628 --> 01:06:14.949]  How do we get this poison banned?
[01:06:14.969 --> 01:06:16.050]  And they're now running ads everywhere.
[01:06:16.070 --> 01:06:18.111]  Oh, it's normal for kids to have strokes and heart attacks too.
[01:06:18.431 --> 01:06:19.912]  Oh yeah, heart attacks and strokes are way up.
[01:06:19.972 --> 01:06:20.413]  It's normal.
[01:06:21.013 --> 01:06:22.614]  Yeah, it's complete insanity.
[01:06:22.674 --> 01:06:24.516]  They're just so over the top with their lies.
[01:06:24.956 --> 01:06:38.687]  And the doctors, myself, Dr. Malone, Dr. McCullough, and a lot of the other doctors that were on Joe Rogan and Majid Nawaz, we have basically blown the whistle on this great big lie and the masses in general.
[01:06:39.787 --> 01:06:40.748]  Don't believe it anymore.
[01:06:40.788 --> 01:06:45.410]  And the general public knows that the media and the government are lying to everybody.
[01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:48.091]  And so, of course, they switch the narrative to the war.
[01:06:48.491 --> 01:06:52.893]  Once they realize the lie is up and has been exposed, then they're just going to switch the narrative.
[01:06:52.993 --> 01:06:57.554]  And then, you know, we have people like, you know, Zelensky is a World Economic Forum puppet.
[01:06:57.574 --> 01:06:58.115]  We know that.
[01:06:58.595 --> 01:07:04.177]   So why is everybody jumping into the Onto his bandwagon as if he's some kind of great hero.
[01:07:04.458 --> 01:07:10.861]  He just, he talks about democracy, but he acts like a fascist, banning all these political parties, and he claims that's democracy.
[01:07:10.901 --> 01:07:11.801]  That's not democracy.
[01:07:12.242 --> 01:07:13.162]  We don't have democracy.
[01:07:13.222 --> 01:07:13.782]  Absolutely.
[01:07:13.802 --> 01:07:19.665]  And I don't think the globalists are like in cahoots with Putin, but Putin mass troops said, say you're not going to join the inter-Armenian invade.
[01:07:20.086 --> 01:07:21.486]  And then Biden said, go ahead and invade.
[01:07:21.506 --> 01:07:22.207]  We won't stop you.
[01:07:22.247 --> 01:07:23.167]  That was the green light.
[01:07:23.407 --> 01:07:26.629]  So they could then use the invasion as the pretext for the new destruction.
[01:07:26.789 --> 01:07:27.810]  So it was all done in front of us.
[01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:30.171]  A deal was made in public with Putin to do this.
[01:07:30.831 --> 01:07:31.111]  Correct.
[01:07:31.171 --> 01:07:34.394]  And that's what I wonder, you know, what remains to be seen is the mystery.
[01:07:34.454 --> 01:07:38.777]  Is Putin still working with the World Economic Forum like he has in the past?
[01:07:38.857 --> 01:07:40.338]  Or is he now going rogue against them?
[01:07:40.699 --> 01:07:42.680]  Because you know the old phrase... Let's talk about it when we come back.
[01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:43.701]  Dr. Ben Marble, stay there.
[01:07:45.862 --> 01:07:48.224]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:48.304 --> 01:07:50.286]  The great Elvis bringing us in.
[01:07:54.471 --> 01:08:00.060]  So, Dr. Ben Marble is about to surpass, in all 50 states, 200,000 people treated.
[01:08:00.701 --> 01:08:02.764]  Undoubtedly saved tens of thousands of lives.
[01:08:03.285 --> 01:08:06.149]  Before I hear about Dr. Ben Marble, another great doctor.
[01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:07.991]  Here in Texas.
[01:08:08.792 --> 01:08:12.295]  Bartlett got in contact with us and he had helped so many people.
[01:08:12.315 --> 01:08:13.837]  We'll get him back on the show very, very soon.
[01:08:14.517 --> 01:08:15.859]  And my dad was going to die.
[01:08:16.199 --> 01:08:18.101]  It was an 87% oxygen chill.
[01:08:18.141 --> 01:08:19.142]  He got the ivermectin.
[01:08:20.043 --> 01:08:23.626]  Within five, six hours, he was back above 90% and bounced back very quickly.
[01:08:23.687 --> 01:08:27.050]  Mentally, it took him a month or so, but very, very serious.
[01:08:27.090 --> 01:08:28.671]  But I wanted you to recap during the break.
[01:08:29.232 --> 01:08:38.721]  We were talking about it, about what woke you up and how you've been, I think, the person to treat most people out of thousands of great doctors and other health care providers that said, screw the system.
[01:08:38.761 --> 01:08:47.329]  I'm going to give people access to legal, lawful prescription drugs that have been proven to be safe and effective that big evil pharma didn't want the public to know about.
[01:08:47.369 --> 01:08:49.071]  So tell us a little bit about your story.
[01:08:49.091 --> 01:08:52.254]  And then I want to drill into the huge developments with the whole COVID narrative.
[01:08:53.117 --> 01:08:56.580]  Well, you know, I didn't become a doctor to sit on the sidelines and watch people die.
[01:08:56.660 --> 01:09:04.467]  So early on, spring of 2020, I realized that Dr. Death Fauci, everything they were recommending was basically wrong.
[01:09:05.448 --> 01:09:18.931]   And so I just ignored everything he said and started, I had been doing some telemedicine already, and so I just, President Trump had come on television and he said he wanted doctors practicing across state lines.
[01:09:19.371 --> 01:09:25.236]  And when he said that, at that point I started just delivering to all 50 states, treating everybody I could and doing it for free.
[01:09:27.992 --> 01:09:34.280]  Eventually, we decided to start asking for donations, and so we do treat everybody for free, but we do ask for a donation at the end.
[01:09:34.881 --> 01:09:39.968]  And things just snowballed over time, and I got... That's something Trump did that was good.
[01:09:40.408 --> 01:09:42.711]  He was early on saying, no, let people try therapeutics.
[01:09:43.092 --> 01:09:45.175]  He tried to put out the good news about them, and they tried to suppress him.
[01:09:45.555 --> 01:09:45.915]  Correct.
[01:09:45.955 --> 01:09:48.057]  And he was on the money about hydroxychloroquine.
[01:09:48.077 --> 01:09:50.598]  Hydroxychloroquine does work, and so does ivermectin.
[01:09:50.638 --> 01:10:00.024]  You know, I was the first, on March the 18th, I told everybody on Facebook, you know, if I get COVID, I'll take hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and zinc.
[01:10:01.505 --> 01:10:03.726]  And so that was the early protocol.
[01:10:03.806 --> 01:10:07.248]  Eventually, we added ivermectin and budesonide and a few other drugs to it.
[01:10:07.628 --> 01:10:09.910]  Certainly, Trump was right on the money about hydroxychloroquine.
[01:10:09.930 --> 01:10:15.329]   What happened was the big pharma, they had to trash talk hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin
[01:10:15.329 --> 01:10:19.570]   because if they were officially approved as COVID treatments, then they could never get
[01:10:19.570 --> 01:10:25.609]   approval for the fake vaccine poison, which now has been given to 5 billion people.
[01:10:25.609 --> 01:10:29.930]   So that was the motive for them trashing ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.
[01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:33.128]   Recently there was a study came out last week that claimed ivermectin didn't work.
[01:10:33.128 --> 01:10:34.289]  Who paid for that study?
[01:10:34.289 --> 01:10:35.289]  Bill Gates.
[01:10:35.289 --> 01:10:39.890]   So, you know, they pay for the studies to get the results they want.
[01:10:39.844 --> 01:10:41.686]  Scientists can be bribed, too.
[01:10:41.726 --> 01:10:42.647]  Doctors can be bribed.
[01:10:42.667 --> 01:10:43.027]  That's right.
[01:10:43.047 --> 01:10:44.229]  They want to own our bodies.
[01:10:44.949 --> 01:10:50.235]  It is a genetic engineering transhumanist takeover, an overwrite, a corporate takeover of our bodies.
[01:10:50.616 --> 01:10:52.658]  That's what the COVID power grab is at the end of the day.
[01:10:53.135 --> 01:10:53.676]  Absolutely.
[01:10:54.056 --> 01:10:58.302]  The World Economic Forum, the evildoers, they're God-hating transhumanists.
[01:10:58.342 --> 01:11:04.531]  They don't like God, they hate God, and they don't like just religion in general, and they... They want to be God.
[01:11:04.832 --> 01:11:05.633]  They want to be God.
[01:11:05.673 --> 01:11:08.717]  They want to play God by editing your God-given genome.
[01:11:09.258 --> 01:11:09.959]  By raping him.
[01:11:10.535 --> 01:11:12.117]  Correct, and people don't understand.
[01:11:12.137 --> 01:11:14.559]  They think this is just some safe vaccine, but it's not.
[01:11:14.599 --> 01:11:16.060]  It's gene-editing poison.
[01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:18.743]  It permanently marks your DNA forever.
[01:11:18.783 --> 01:11:19.564]  You're permanently marked.
[01:11:19.604 --> 01:11:26.471]  So that sounds awfully a lot like the Mark of the Beast to me, because it does mark your DNA, and that's a permanent thing.
[01:11:27.665 --> 01:11:28.265]  It's incredible.
[01:11:28.285 --> 01:11:29.446]  Let's look at some of these articles.
[01:11:29.966 --> 01:11:36.070]  CDC credibility takes another blow after another mistake exaggerating death numbers.
[01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:38.031]  Exaggerating how good the shot is.
[01:11:38.051 --> 01:11:40.232]  It actually erases your immune system.
[01:11:40.252 --> 01:11:42.193]  That's why I call them the Center for Death Control.
[01:11:42.513 --> 01:11:42.833]  That's right.
[01:11:42.873 --> 01:11:43.434]  Here's another one.
[01:11:43.454 --> 01:11:45.735]  I want to play this clip out of China this month.
[01:11:46.055 --> 01:11:47.496]  This is what's coming to the rest of the world.
[01:11:47.896 --> 01:11:49.497]  This video is from March of this month.
[01:11:49.857 --> 01:11:59.863]   In China, if you don't do daily mandatory COVID tests, police will come to your door, arrest you, and will You will get at least one year prison sentence.
[01:12:00.123 --> 01:12:08.789]  Let's go ahead and roll that video.
[01:12:09.029 --> 01:12:10.730]  And look at him trying to make him wear the mask.
[01:12:11.891 --> 01:12:15.194]  They made a test in an authoritarian country, the greatest authoritarian country ever seen.
[01:12:15.014 --> 01:12:18.014]  A hundred million of their own citizens killed.
[01:12:18.014 --> 01:12:28.014]   And they took a mask off him, tackle him and take him away to the camp.
[01:12:28.948 --> 01:12:34.109]  And they're never going to take those stupid masks off.
[01:12:34.609 --> 01:12:38.450]  It's the ceremonial garb you wear while you're engaged in tyranny.
[01:12:41.071 --> 01:12:43.192]  It's the new swastika, what I say.
[01:12:43.212 --> 01:12:46.993]  It has no function other than to let people know you're part of the Ibidur crowd.
[01:12:47.013 --> 01:12:47.373]  Well, that's right.
[01:12:47.393 --> 01:12:48.614]  It's just like wearing an armband.
[01:12:49.274 --> 01:12:50.514]  It shows you're under the hypnosis.
[01:12:54.454 --> 01:12:56.635]  Yeah, the global mass psychosis is very real.
[01:12:57.655 --> 01:13:24.249]   We're going to show you some video now for TV viewers, I'll describe it for radio listeners, of one of their cities where 37 million people are locked down and thousands of vans, every one of those is a white government van, same ones they use for mobile executions, And they are just pulling up to take hundreds of thousands of people away to camps.
[01:13:24.829 --> 01:13:37.996]  That is an organized, tyrannical government practicing martial law and total dictatorship under Xi Jinping, who his main minion is Bill Gates and others, and now exporting that here to the West.
[01:13:38.356 --> 01:13:38.717]  Dr. Marble?
[01:13:39.057 --> 01:13:40.938]  That's the Great Reset summed up.
[01:13:41.038 --> 01:13:42.879]  They're trying to cull the human herd.
[01:13:43.399 --> 01:13:43.919]  It's nuts.
[01:13:44.019 --> 01:13:45.440]  You know the new variant, Ba-2?
[01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:45.560]  B-A-2?
[01:13:47.441 --> 01:13:48.022]  What's baa?
[01:13:48.262 --> 01:13:49.664]  Baa 2 is baa baa.
[01:13:49.704 --> 01:13:50.084]  What is that?
[01:13:50.145 --> 01:13:51.867]  That's the sound sheep make.
[01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:54.390]  They're making... They're mocking us.
[01:13:54.510 --> 01:13:55.051]  Baa 2.
[01:13:55.171 --> 01:13:55.491]  Baa.
[01:13:56.252 --> 01:13:56.593]  Exactly.
[01:13:56.933 --> 01:13:58.055]  They're openly mocking us.
[01:13:58.115 --> 01:13:58.696]  It's crazy.
[01:14:00.452 --> 01:14:01.032]  Well, you know, they did that.
[01:14:01.072 --> 01:14:06.216]  The Spars document came out three years before with the Rockefellers and others before they released COVID.
[01:14:06.256 --> 01:14:07.597]  It's set in 2023, 2025, 2028.
[01:14:08.358 --> 01:14:10.099]  It's set 2020, 2023.
[01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:14.402]  They even have the tweets modeled with the COVID-19.
[01:14:14.582 --> 01:14:15.883]  They just flipped the numbers around.
[01:14:16.184 --> 01:14:18.525]  They wanted us to know they planned the whole thing years before.
[01:14:18.926 --> 01:14:19.626]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:14:20.066 --> 01:14:21.047]  It is the pandemic.
[01:14:22.674 --> 01:14:24.276]  You know, they've done it out in the open.
[01:14:24.937 --> 01:14:28.101]  How they haven't been held accountable yet is a mystery to me.
[01:14:28.642 --> 01:14:30.404]  But they have to be held accountable.
[01:14:30.945 --> 01:14:33.168]  Not holding them accountable means we all wind up dead.
[01:14:33.188 --> 01:14:36.733]  I was out in California last week.
[01:14:39.363 --> 01:14:43.464]  Doc, and a bunch of places wouldn't let us in, the restaurants and places, without the vaccine passport.
[01:14:43.524 --> 01:14:54.428]  I went to D.C., the same exact thing, for the Defeat the Mandates event, and lo and behold, you couldn't go in anywhere in Washington, D.C., the nation's capital, without a mask or a vaccine passport.
[01:14:55.268 --> 01:14:56.228]  So I just didn't go in.
[01:14:56.308 --> 01:14:57.069]  I didn't go anywhere.
[01:14:57.169 --> 01:14:59.110]  You can't get a cop if you need one, you're being mugged.
[01:14:59.130 --> 01:15:04.051]  But oh, they're there to make sure you put this experimental MRNA in your body so you can buy and sell.
[01:15:04.131 --> 01:15:08.613]  So it's kind of crazy because people, you know, Zelensky wants to talk about democracy.
[01:15:08.693 --> 01:15:15.896]  Meanwhile, they're doing all this fascist stuff, forcing people with lockdowns and masks and forcing people to take poison they don't want to take.
[01:15:16.356 --> 01:15:19.497]  So for them to even claim democracy exists is just a great big lie.
[01:15:19.517 --> 01:15:20.738]  That should be obvious to anybody.
[01:15:21.777 --> 01:15:27.216]   That's right, look at this sign. "We don't hire the unvaccinated, go home."
[01:15:27.216 --> 01:15:34.256]   And then look at this, this is a great meme with a quote by Jason Christopher.
[01:15:34.256 --> 01:15:39.936]  "There's a very firm psychological reason why the catch..."
[01:15:39.917 --> 01:15:45.596]   phrase of the day is "follow the science" and not "confirm the science," "validate
[01:15:45.596 --> 01:15:49.917]   the science," "debate the science," or "replicate the science." Science is never
[01:15:49.917 --> 01:15:54.596]   settled or followed unless evil is trying to set a trap for the public.
[01:15:54.596 --> 01:15:59.267]  Correct. I would say don't follow the science, follow Jesus.
[01:15:59.267 --> 01:16:05.557]   Where do you see all this going? Well, we have to hold these evil people
[01:16:05.557 --> 01:16:13.853]   accountable. I see What I see happening is the longer Ukraine war drags out, I think Putin's inevitably going to use a nuke on somebody.
[01:16:14.073 --> 01:16:15.714]  The question remains to be seen on who.
[01:16:16.554 --> 01:16:20.676]  I wish he would drop one on Davos, but that's not for me to decide.
[01:16:22.932 --> 01:16:24.154]  Nothing good is going to happen.
[01:16:24.174 --> 01:16:24.934]  Things are going to get worse.
[01:16:24.974 --> 01:16:28.858]  What we're having right now is we're witnessing the greatest mass poisoning in human history.
[01:16:28.918 --> 01:16:31.060]  Over 5 billion people have been poisoned.
[01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:35.444]  So because of that, this year, we're going to have the mass die off of 2022.
[01:16:35.504 --> 01:16:37.806]  More people dying this year than any year in human history.
[01:16:38.046 --> 01:16:38.446]  Period.
[01:16:38.686 --> 01:16:43.471]  By the way, last year, as you and others predicted, record numbers of deaths of the vaccine.
[01:16:43.891 --> 01:16:44.291]  Correct.
[01:16:45.252 --> 01:16:49.334]  Many places like UK now reporting 90% of deaths are in the vaccinated.
[01:16:49.454 --> 01:16:50.974]  So it's not a vaccine.
[01:16:51.134 --> 01:16:52.855]  It's gene editing poison.
[01:16:52.895 --> 01:16:54.476]  I wish people would stop taking poison.
[01:16:54.496 --> 01:16:58.638]  This has been the most frustrating thing of my career, trying to convince patients not to take poison.
[01:16:58.998 --> 01:17:00.098]  It's it's maddening.
[01:17:00.159 --> 01:17:00.699]  It's crazy.
[01:17:01.019 --> 01:17:02.880]  Dr. Marble, stay right there.
[01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:03.620]  We'll be right back.
[01:17:04.621 --> 01:17:07.621]  Dr. Ben Marble in studio.
[01:17:07.621 --> 01:17:16.621]  He'll be hosting the fourth hour tomorrow.
[01:17:16.621 --> 01:17:26.621]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:17:19.765 --> 01:17:25.570]  Briefly, I'm just going to say something that I went to our developers a couple years ago and I said I really like...
[01:17:27.165 --> 01:17:35.030]  These best-selling magnesium fizzy drinks that they sell at the grocery stores or that they sell at Whole Foods.
[01:17:35.130 --> 01:17:36.431]  I've been taking it for 20 years.
[01:17:36.991 --> 01:17:40.954]  I learned with children, especially when they were, you know, tired and grumpy but not going to sleep.
[01:17:41.514 --> 01:17:48.959]  Give them a little bit of that, you know, mood stuff or whatever you want to call it and they would sleep a lot better and it's good for their heart, their whole electrochemical system.
[01:17:49.719 --> 01:17:54.541]  So, our developers came up with one that has both types of the good magnesium and tastes even better.
[01:17:55.042 --> 01:17:56.082]  And I'm just blown away by it.
[01:17:56.102 --> 01:17:57.263]  It's been sold out for eight months.
[01:17:57.323 --> 01:17:58.583]  I'm so glad it's back in.
[01:17:58.864 --> 01:17:59.904]  Supply chain breakdowns.
[01:18:00.224 --> 01:18:02.505]  Fizzy magnesium, 25% off.
[01:18:02.986 --> 01:18:05.047]  Infowarsstore.com, you need to experience it.
[01:18:05.547 --> 01:18:08.989]  And then a new item that I've been wanting for two years, finally got it.
[01:18:10.475 --> 01:18:12.557]  Development deal a year ago and it's here now.
[01:18:12.697 --> 01:18:20.282]  It's immune support from InfoWars Life, Elderberry, Echinacea, Astrologous Root, Angelica Root, and Lomatum Root.
[01:18:20.702 --> 01:18:24.805]  All of these are concentrated, cold-pressed, from one of the top developers in the country.
[01:18:25.346 --> 01:18:27.087]  So good for adults, children, everybody.
[01:18:27.407 --> 01:18:29.369]  This is something you should be taking every day.
[01:18:30.672 --> 01:18:32.734]  12 months out of the year, and it funds the InfoWar.
[01:18:33.034 --> 01:18:34.315]  Immune support now available.
[01:18:34.656 --> 01:18:35.717]  InfoWarStore.com.
[01:18:36.017 --> 01:18:37.318]  Going back to Dr. Ben Marble.
[01:18:37.458 --> 01:18:38.880]  Doc, I've been asking a lot of questions.
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:44.805]  I got a lot more to hit and a lot more news surrounding COVID, but what do you make of the whole thing falling apart?
[01:18:44.825 --> 01:18:47.327]  I mean, that's thanks to you and the listeners and all these other great people.
[01:18:47.767 --> 01:18:49.689]  They intended to keep pushing this a lot longer.
[01:18:49.709 --> 01:18:51.110]  Now they admit, though, it's leaked.
[01:18:51.491 --> 01:18:53.172]  They're going to try to bring it back over the midterms.
[01:18:53.573 --> 01:18:54.714]  How big a deal is this?
[01:18:55.754 --> 01:18:56.255]  Oh, it's huge.
[01:18:56.335 --> 01:19:08.014]  Certainly, part of the brainwashing technique is you do what's called waves of terror, which you do the lockdowns, the forced social distancing and everything, and mask, and then you lighten up for a little bit.
[01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:18.146]  It's how you train a horse to first give it grain, pet it, put a bridle on it, but don't ride it, then touch it, then put a saddle on it, then a week later try to get up on the horse.
[01:19:18.206 --> 01:19:18.926]  It is a process of domestication.
[01:19:18.766 --> 01:19:21.766]   and all that. That's part of how they successfully brainwash everybody.
[01:19:21.766 --> 01:19:26.846]   It's how you train a horse to first give it grain, pet it, put a bridle on it, but don't
[01:19:26.846 --> 01:19:31.406]   ride it, then touch it, then put a saddle on it, then a week later try to get up on
[01:19:31.406 --> 01:19:36.366]   the horse. It is a process of domestication. It's how pedophiles train children.
[01:19:36.366 --> 01:19:37.886]  Yep, absolutely.
[01:19:38.238 --> 01:19:41.619]  So, you know, we know this is what's happening.
[01:19:41.659 --> 01:19:42.660]  We know this is what they're doing.
[01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:46.262]  We've studied, you know, psychology knows how to brainwash people successfully.
[01:19:46.602 --> 01:19:48.763]  One of the things, how do you break through brainwashing?
[01:19:49.023 --> 01:19:50.664]  You can't do it by being nice to people.
[01:19:50.684 --> 01:19:51.524]  You have to be rude.
[01:19:51.564 --> 01:19:53.145]  You have to insult them.
[01:19:53.185 --> 01:19:54.085]  You have to mock them.
[01:19:54.426 --> 01:19:55.786]  You have to get out of your comfort zone.
[01:19:55.806 --> 01:19:57.367]  The globals are trying to break your will.
[01:19:57.627 --> 01:20:00.008]  Don't let them break your will and don't let them enslave these people.
[01:20:00.188 --> 01:20:01.169]  You got to say, wake up!
[01:20:01.429 --> 01:20:02.970]  Get out of your control paradigm!
[01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:04.560]  Absolutely.
[01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:08.561]  Just comply and we'll get through this together.
[01:20:08.581 --> 01:20:09.221]  No we won't.
[01:20:09.441 --> 01:20:10.242]  It's never ending.
[01:20:10.462 --> 01:20:11.502]  Compliance is death.
[01:20:11.642 --> 01:20:12.762]  We will not comply.
[01:20:13.042 --> 01:20:13.462]  No way.
[01:20:14.063 --> 01:20:15.183]  Never taking the poison.
[01:20:15.243 --> 01:20:16.083]  Not going to happen.
[01:20:17.283 --> 01:20:18.604]  I wanted to bring up something else.
[01:20:18.644 --> 01:20:21.084]  Fake Dr. Jill Biden.
[01:20:21.324 --> 01:20:28.286]  There's a law, maybe you know it, in Congress where Congress can declare the President incompetent and remove him from office.
[01:20:28.786 --> 01:20:29.246]  25th Amendment.
[01:20:29.266 --> 01:20:29.787]  Okay, 25th Amendment.
[01:20:29.927 --> 01:20:30.147]  That's it.
[01:20:32.074 --> 01:20:34.415]  Why haven't they 25th Amendment Joe Biden yet?
[01:20:34.455 --> 01:20:35.996]  Everybody knows he has dementia.
[01:20:36.336 --> 01:20:40.738]  What's going on is the elder abuse of Joe Biden and they're doing it in front of the entire world.
[01:20:41.119 --> 01:20:48.322]  Jill Biden should be arrested for elder abuse and they should 25th Amendment dementia Joe because he has obvious dementia.
[01:20:48.342 --> 01:20:48.923]  We all know it.
[01:20:50.843 --> 01:20:51.404]  Absolutely.
[01:20:52.144 --> 01:20:53.285]  Where do you see all this going?
[01:20:55.083 --> 01:20:56.723]  Well, that remains to be seen.
[01:20:56.803 --> 01:21:13.446]  I'm hoping that somehow, someway, God sends some effective way to rid us of the World Economic Forum evildoers and their evil plans to destroy humanity and do this coal of the human herd and kill millions of people.
[01:21:13.506 --> 01:21:18.067]  I think God sent us you and Rand Paul and myself and Joe Rogan and everybody.
[01:21:18.087 --> 01:21:22.868]  We need to expose their plan and say no to it and then call for their indictment and legal and lawful imprisonment.
[01:21:23.846 --> 01:21:25.527]  I pray every day for that to happen.
[01:21:26.267 --> 01:21:28.007]  And everybody else should pray for that as well.
[01:21:28.187 --> 01:21:29.468]  I would encourage everybody to pray.
[01:21:29.828 --> 01:21:42.731]  You know, when you're in times of despair and just overall global deceit and evil, praying is a really useful tool to keep you sane and keep you grounded and keep you in touch with your faith.
[01:21:43.192 --> 01:21:44.132]  I totally agree with you.
[01:21:44.152 --> 01:21:45.592]  I totally agree.
[01:21:45.612 --> 01:21:48.133]  I have prayed more in the past two years than I have in my entire life.
[01:21:50.265 --> 01:21:50.845]  Absolutely.
[01:21:51.185 --> 01:21:52.526]  And it shows psychologically.
[01:21:52.546 --> 01:21:54.286]  People get better when they pray more.
[01:21:54.326 --> 01:21:55.507]  They're healthier when they pray more.
[01:21:55.847 --> 01:21:56.247]  It's real.
[01:21:56.747 --> 01:21:57.368]  It's very real.
[01:21:57.408 --> 01:21:58.788]  It's almost like meditation.
[01:21:59.408 --> 01:22:00.229]  These things help.
[01:22:00.469 --> 01:22:08.752]  And so I would encourage everybody to pray, to see the takedown of the evil people that are propagating this mess on us.
[01:22:08.832 --> 01:22:13.653]  And all we can do is what we're doing to try to make that come to fruition.
[01:22:13.733 --> 01:22:14.894]  Well, I've asked you three times.
[01:22:15.094 --> 01:22:16.454]  You say interesting things every time.
[01:22:16.474 --> 01:22:18.155]  That's why I always say it to smart guys.
[01:22:18.895 --> 01:22:20.597]  ...and ladies is, what's the solution?
[01:22:20.658 --> 01:22:21.759]  What else is on your radar?
[01:22:22.079 --> 01:22:22.820]  How do we stop this?
[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:24.583]  You keep going, God, God, God, God.
[01:22:25.043 --> 01:22:30.070]  Reaching out to God and then taking action with God's, uh, enlightenment and discernment God gives us.
[01:22:30.711 --> 01:22:37.959]   My dad always prayed a prayer when we were sitting around the table for dinner or whatever, he'd say, You know, please lead God and direct us to the nourishment of our bodies.
[01:22:38.059 --> 01:22:41.662]  Please help us be good stewards of our life and all the things you've given us.
[01:22:42.323 --> 01:22:46.367]  Basically saying that, but we need to pray that God lead, guide, and direct us.
[01:22:46.848 --> 01:22:47.889]  We are the solution.
[01:22:48.229 --> 01:22:54.595]   God has given us the power and dominion over the earth, not the globalists, but we must exercise Absolutely.
[01:22:54.435 --> 01:22:59.114]   birthright and our deed to this planet and to our destiny now. They're trying to
[01:22:59.114 --> 01:23:02.114]   tell you you're dirty, you're evil, you're bad for the earth, turn it over, die
[01:23:02.114 --> 01:23:07.515]   crawling a hole. And our answer to swabbing them is no! You want to die? You
[01:23:07.515 --> 01:23:15.474]   kill yourself. We're not going anywhere. Absolutely. You know, it's just
[01:23:15.474 --> 01:23:20.235]   really unbelievable that the world has come to this at this point in time.
[01:23:20.653 --> 01:23:24.956]  So we really need to pray to God to help us and lead us and deliver us from this evil.
[01:23:25.257 --> 01:23:26.518]  And I think that it will happen.
[01:23:27.138 --> 01:23:33.183]  Certainly, you know, the World Economic Forum, they hate all the Abrahamic religions.
[01:23:33.263 --> 01:23:34.104]  They hate Muslims.
[01:23:34.144 --> 01:23:34.845]  They hate Christians.
[01:23:34.885 --> 01:23:35.545]  They hate Jews.
[01:23:36.506 --> 01:23:37.427]  And any other religion.
[01:23:38.508 --> 01:23:39.749]  Their religion... They hate God.
[01:23:39.909 --> 01:23:41.650]  Political correctness is their religion.
[01:23:42.871 --> 01:23:45.834]  They do hate God, and they think they want to try and be God.
[01:23:45.894 --> 01:23:51.459]  And that's how we started the interview with that Muslim convert who's about the most articulate person I've ever heard.
[01:23:51.499 --> 01:23:52.881]  Everything he says is basically true.
[01:23:52.901 --> 01:23:55.323]  I mean, I gotta get this guy on.
[01:23:55.863 --> 01:23:56.724]  Majid Nawaz.
[01:23:57.385 --> 01:23:58.065]  Yeah, he's awesome.
[01:23:58.106 --> 01:23:58.506]  I love him.
[01:23:59.767 --> 01:24:00.887]  They're really scared of him, by the way.
[01:24:00.907 --> 01:24:01.868]  Call him on Joe Rogan.
[01:24:01.888 --> 01:24:02.688]  He did a great job.
[01:24:02.708 --> 01:24:03.728]  They should be scared of him.
[01:24:03.748 --> 01:24:11.171]  This is, you know, uniting people like him and the Christians and the Jews, like Dr. Zelenko.
[01:24:12.551 --> 01:24:18.293]  We could all kind of combine forces together and work against the world economic forum.
[01:24:18.313 --> 01:24:20.594]  That's what we need to do, so we need to all coordinate better.
[01:24:20.614 --> 01:24:23.655]  Well, that's why they hate us, is we're identifying who really runs the show.
[01:24:23.855 --> 01:24:24.295]  Correct.
[01:24:24.755 --> 01:24:35.099]   And, you know, it's gotten to the point where I can't get into, you know, any details, but I mean, I've talked to a lot of members of the Bilderberg Group, people that have gone, and I've had dinner with them and stuff recently.
[01:24:35.119 --> 01:24:38.641]  And I'm not going to talk about anything that's happened, but they're not all bad.
[01:24:38.661 --> 01:24:43.204]  A lot of them just got into this for power, or they were already successful, so they got recruited, and now they know it's evil.
[01:24:43.224 --> 01:24:45.345]  And a lot of people are trying to figure out how to navigate out of this.
[01:24:46.109 --> 01:24:48.671]  Yeah, that's the great thing, is how do they get out of it?
[01:24:48.691 --> 01:24:50.293]  It's kind of like the doctors in America.
[01:24:50.753 --> 01:24:52.014]  They're caught in this legal trap.
[01:24:52.034 --> 01:25:04.444]  You know, 99.9% of the doctors in America that recommended this poison for their patients, they're now stuck in a legal trap because if, you know, a few months later they realize, hey, this is poison, they can't tell their patients that because then they'll get sued for malpractice.
[01:25:04.724 --> 01:25:05.165]  Absolutely.
[01:25:05.185 --> 01:25:12.271]  I don't tell people the stuff about, hey, heads of state call me, former heads of intelligence agencies call me, billionaires call me.
[01:25:12.771 --> 01:25:14.092]  I'm not saying to go, ooh, I'm fancy.
[01:25:14.152 --> 01:25:15.733]  I'm saying we're not making this up.
[01:25:16.013 --> 01:25:20.496]  The smartest people even in the system agree with us and listen to the show.
[01:25:20.676 --> 01:25:23.318]  This show is the cutting edge of reality.
[01:25:23.738 --> 01:25:24.959]  Absolutely, no question about it.
[01:25:25.039 --> 01:25:28.741]  Info Wars is the cutting edge of getting the truth out.
[01:25:31.303 --> 01:25:32.624]  Appreciate you guys doing that.
[01:25:32.664 --> 01:25:35.285]  Well, it's not about, it's not about, I want you to know, we appreciate you Dr. Marble.
[01:25:35.345 --> 01:25:37.266]  It's the listeners need to know what they've done.
[01:25:37.726 --> 01:25:40.547]  Their work, their support paid off for humanity, okay?
[01:25:40.808 --> 01:25:42.328]  And now we're going to the thick of the battle, folks.
[01:25:42.348 --> 01:25:44.489]  I'm just saying, this is, this is game time.
[01:25:44.850 --> 01:25:45.730]  This is war.
[01:25:45.790 --> 01:25:48.271]  You know, if people don't realize that, this is a biological war.
[01:25:48.571 --> 01:25:50.692]  The bioterror war started in 2020.
[01:25:51.713 --> 01:26:02.956]   We know Dr. Death Fauci funded the creation of the COVID-19 virus and and the poison. So this is bioterrorism. They unleashed bioterrorism
[01:26:02.956 --> 01:26:06.706]   on the world. We still have this denial. A lot of people just don't believe or
[01:26:06.706 --> 01:26:11.136]   understand that we are under biological war and have been for two years.
[01:26:11.136 --> 01:26:15.595]   And that's why I said last night on the Sunday show, we need to understand we're all veterans
[01:26:15.595 --> 01:26:16.595]  of a bioweapon war.
[01:26:17.472 --> 01:26:18.653]  Now you had COVID, right?
[01:26:19.013 --> 01:26:19.254]  Yes.
[01:26:19.074 --> 01:26:22.774]  black, white, old, young, Hispanic, Asian, gay, straight.
[01:26:22.774 --> 01:26:27.353]   You were all attacked by Fauci and the UN and the New World Order and Peter Daszak and
[01:26:27.353 --> 01:26:28.993]  Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab.
[01:26:28.993 --> 01:26:29.993]  They're bragging about it.
[01:26:29.993 --> 01:26:33.794]   They hit us with a bioweapon and then they countered it with another bioweapon.
[01:26:33.794 --> 01:26:35.793]  That's not a game, people.
[01:26:35.793 --> 01:26:36.793]  Absolutely.
[01:26:36.793 --> 01:26:37.793]  Now, you had COVID, right?
[01:26:37.793 --> 01:26:38.793]  Yes.
[01:26:38.793 --> 01:26:39.793]  OK, so you had it.
[01:26:39.793 --> 01:26:40.793]  I had it.
[01:26:40.793 --> 01:26:42.793]  So Dr. Death Fauci tried to murder both of us.
[01:26:42.793 --> 01:26:43.793]  We hear you.
[01:26:43.793 --> 01:26:48.554]   Listen, we are literally living during a bioweapon attack where they hit you with one part of
[01:26:48.554 --> 01:26:51.674]  the binary attack completion is the shot.
[01:26:51.794 --> 01:26:52.754]  It's on record, folks.
[01:26:52.855 --> 01:26:55.556]  You are all the victims of a bioweapon war.
[01:26:55.576 --> 01:26:56.456]  But we're not going to be victims.
[01:26:56.636 --> 01:26:58.817]  We're going to be overcomers, and we're going to bring them to justice.
[01:26:58.857 --> 01:27:01.638]  But realize, you are a victim of a bioweapon attack.
[01:27:01.918 --> 01:27:03.579]  You survived a bioweapon attack.
[01:27:03.779 --> 01:27:05.080]  Many of your friends and family didn't.
[01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:07.080]  And these people will pay!
[01:27:07.581 --> 01:27:12.763]  Or, we are aiding and abetting their murders, and they will pay for what they've done!
[01:27:14.813 --> 01:27:15.934]  They'll pay, for sure.
[01:27:15.974 --> 01:27:16.634]  No doubt about it.
[01:27:16.714 --> 01:27:18.015]  On Judgment Day, they'll all pay.
[01:27:19.175 --> 01:27:22.777]  They will pay, in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[01:27:23.217 --> 01:27:28.900]  They will be defeated, and they will be brought low, and they will be broken for what they've done!
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:31.641]  Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, all of you!
[01:27:31.981 --> 01:27:33.602]  You will face judgment!
[01:27:34.887 --> 01:27:38.850]  One way or another, New World Order, we're gonna getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha.
[01:27:39.430 --> 01:27:42.352]  Dr. Ben Marble, write this down, MyFreeDoctor.com.

[01:27:53.058 --> 01:27:55.140]  Glad you're in Austin, in town, we're able to come by.
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:58.422]  But just, you got cut off by the break, you were saying, God wins.
[01:27:59.022 --> 01:28:00.183]  God wins in the end, for sure.
[01:28:01.684 --> 01:28:03.471]  Closing comments before you co-host tomorrow.
[01:28:03.491 --> 01:28:05.238]  I think you're also going to be popping in on the war room today.
[01:28:06.024 --> 01:28:09.665]  Well, I would like to tell people to go to MyFreeDoctor.com.
[01:28:10.065 --> 01:28:12.585]  We can now treat non-COVID related health problems.
[01:28:13.546 --> 01:28:17.606]  Anything that's appropriate for telemedicine, we can now handle and we treat everybody for free.
[01:28:18.307 --> 01:28:21.767]  And we do ask for a donation at the end, so I like to make sure people are aware of that.
[01:28:21.807 --> 01:28:23.028]  If you can't donate, that's fine.
[01:28:24.328 --> 01:28:26.528]  We do not prescribe controlled substances.
[01:28:26.608 --> 01:28:29.729]  I would say that as well, because sometimes people come and think we do.
[01:28:29.769 --> 01:28:31.609]  Yeah, folks, you're not going to call up and get codeine.
[01:28:33.270 --> 01:28:33.810]  Keep going, sorry.
[01:28:36.303 --> 01:28:42.205]  You know, MyFreeDoctor.com, you can get a free doctor visit, all 50 states in America, and we'll try to help you as best we can.
[01:28:42.225 --> 01:28:46.386]  If you have a problem that we can't handle, we'll try to give you direction to the people who can.
[01:28:48.407 --> 01:28:49.007]  Gut level.
[01:28:49.047 --> 01:28:53.248]  I mean, we know from the Canadian Health Minister and others, they're going to just launch a new lockdown soon.
[01:28:53.808 --> 01:29:02.791]  That's why we've got to, in my view, just keep hammering them, calling for justice, exposing them now, not just for all the people they killed and for justice, but to stop them from launching the next wave.
[01:29:03.422 --> 01:29:03.802]  Absolutely.
[01:29:03.822 --> 01:29:05.804]  You know, there's one other thing we haven't talked about yet.
[01:29:06.264 --> 01:29:06.885]  The blood bank.
[01:29:07.285 --> 01:29:09.567]  The blood supply in the United States is completely corrupt.
[01:29:09.607 --> 01:29:13.610]  It's contaminated with spike protein because they're taking blood from vaccinated people.
[01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:15.871]  So we need an alternate blood supply.
[01:29:15.932 --> 01:29:18.133]  So hopefully, eventually, we can develop that.
[01:29:18.694 --> 01:29:22.857]  I've seen articles, Doc, where a lot of the blood banks won't take people when they've been vaccinated.
[01:29:23.499 --> 01:29:24.800]  Well, that's news to me.
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:28.541]  If they've started doing that now, that's good because they need to not take their blood.
[01:29:28.581 --> 01:29:32.563]  The vaccinated people have spike protein in their blood, which causes all the symptoms of COVID.
[01:29:33.243 --> 01:29:34.243]  And how long does it stay?
[01:29:34.303 --> 01:29:37.004]  I know they've got a year and a half studies now saying it's still in the blood.
[01:29:37.344 --> 01:29:37.905]  That's the thing.
[01:29:38.305 --> 01:29:41.286]  When it first came out, they said it was going to stay in just for a few days.
[01:29:41.346 --> 01:29:46.168]  But we found out now, over a year later, that people are still producing the spike protein.
[01:29:46.248 --> 01:29:49.029]  It's colonizing the body and causing long-term COVID.
[01:29:49.971 --> 01:29:54.380]  Spike protein is the poison and so they may be producing this for the rest of their lives.
[01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:55.061]  We don't know yet.
[01:29:56.043 --> 01:29:56.865]  That's the scary thing.
[01:29:57.807 --> 01:30:00.031]  One thing's for sure, Fauci and Gates look scared now.
[01:30:00.754 --> 01:30:01.294]  Oh, they are.
[01:30:02.495 --> 01:30:04.475]  Dr. Death Fauci's hiding in a hole somewhere.
[01:30:05.636 --> 01:30:06.316]  He should be scared.
[01:30:06.336 --> 01:30:09.317]  He needs to be arrested as soon as possible, along with the rest of them.
[01:30:09.337 --> 01:30:15.140]  They need to be on trial in Nuremberg 2.0 because it's obvious to everybody who's been paying attention what's going on.
[01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:19.501]  So they have to be held accountable is the bottom line.
[01:30:20.622 --> 01:30:21.002]  You're right.
[01:30:21.022 --> 01:30:22.562]  I want to play this clip because I mentioned it.
[01:30:22.602 --> 01:30:36.427]   This is the premiere in Canada of one of their major Look at the arrogance of John Horgan mocking Canadians protesting COVID restrictions that they intend to have go forever.
[01:30:36.447 --> 01:30:46.690]  They're now arresting preachers that they've been holding in some cases for up to several months without charges with no bond for being on the streets protesting lockdowns.
[01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:52.873]  And they're trying to get 10 years in prison and no bond for folks that organize the peaceful trucker convoy.
[01:30:53.193 --> 01:30:54.194]  This is North Korea.
[01:30:54.254 --> 01:30:55.014]  Come to Canada.
[01:30:55.474 --> 01:30:57.756]  Here is this crazy looking nutcase.
[01:30:57.796 --> 01:30:58.176]  Here it is.
[01:30:58.772 --> 01:31:01.915]  And I would just say to these people, goodness me, get a hobby.
[01:31:02.115 --> 01:31:03.877]  Find something else to do with your time.
[01:31:04.558 --> 01:31:09.723]  We are removing restrictions at a pace that is consistent with the work we've done for the past two years.
[01:31:10.584 --> 01:31:14.367]  And 94% of adults in British Columbia are vaccinated.
[01:31:14.687 --> 01:31:22.976]  So we're spending an awful lot of time with a small group of people who seem to have nothing better to do with their time but to drive around in circles honking their horns.
[01:31:23.556 --> 01:31:32.282]  I wish they'd take some time to watch television and see the evening news about real tragedies and real disruptions in freedom that are going on in Europe right now.
[01:31:32.602 --> 01:31:33.383]  Give your head a shake.
[01:31:33.843 --> 01:31:37.125]  Find a better way to take your energies and put it to positive outcomes.
[01:31:37.165 --> 01:31:43.850]  That's my recommendation, and I'm hopeful that some of the people who were planning to come here will take that to heart and do the right thing.
[01:31:44.150 --> 01:31:47.092]  Find positive pursuits for your excess energy.
[01:31:47.352 --> 01:31:53.096]  That man is under the command of Klaus Schwab, the new world order, as is the dictator of Canada, and these people are a shame.
[01:31:54.656 --> 01:31:55.657]  Well, you know, I'm a doctor.
[01:31:55.697 --> 01:31:57.379]  I swore an oath not to take lies.
[01:31:57.399 --> 01:31:59.601]  But if I was a soldier, I'd punch that guy right in the face.
[01:31:59.621 --> 01:32:02.825]  You know, it's ridiculous.
[01:32:02.845 --> 01:32:05.287]  I know you're mad, Doc, but here's the deal.
[01:32:05.307 --> 01:32:07.690]  They're going to stage attacks on themselves and blame us.
[01:32:08.270 --> 01:32:08.831]  False flags.
[01:32:08.851 --> 01:32:11.313]  So we want them to be tried by a jury of their peers.
[01:32:12.253 --> 01:32:14.615]  And then we want him to go to jail for violating the Nuremberg Code.
[01:32:14.635 --> 01:32:15.436]  We need Nuremberg too.
[01:32:15.456 --> 01:32:16.917]  We need him to be hauled in there.
[01:32:17.297 --> 01:32:23.282]  And those that we find that are consciously involved and were part of this dehumanization, the bio-attack, well there'll be a very serious punishment for them.
[01:32:23.642 --> 01:32:24.783]  But after it's been adjudicated.
[01:32:24.823 --> 01:32:26.244]  Dr. Marble, thank you so much for being here with us.
[01:32:26.725 --> 01:32:27.305]  Thanks for having me.
[01:32:27.125 --> 01:32:39.164]  me. I really appreciate it.
[01:32:39.090 --> 01:32:58.823]  And in the month of February, we had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product X3 that has all three types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity in your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much.
[01:32:58.943 --> 01:33:02.546]  And the majority of the population of the world is iodine deficient.
[01:33:02.846 --> 01:33:04.307]  This is the very best iodine out there.
[01:33:05.147 --> 01:33:08.488]  We had it on sale at 50% off, but we sold more than half of what we have.
[01:33:08.969 --> 01:33:12.890]  More isn't going to come in for a long time, so I took it back to full price.
[01:33:12.910 --> 01:33:14.111]  And I was just thinking, you know what?
[01:33:14.491 --> 01:33:16.391]  We need the funds in now to stay on air.
[01:33:16.812 --> 01:33:18.712]  Plus, this is a great product everybody needs.
[01:33:19.193 --> 01:33:28.276]  So to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get X3 and experience it for yourself and support the broadcast, I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out.
[01:33:28.756 --> 01:33:32.097]  Get X3 right now exclusively at Infowarestore.com for 50% off.
[01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:40.422]  Well, I like to have people on that give us next decade's news today, tomorrow's news today.
[01:33:40.442 --> 01:33:42.783]  And it's been many years since he was on.
[01:33:42.823 --> 01:33:43.903]  It's been far too long.
[01:33:44.564 --> 01:33:46.224]  And I'm glad he's here with us.
[01:33:46.804 --> 01:33:49.745]  Martin Armstrong, armstrongeconomics.com.
[01:33:50.266 --> 01:33:51.506]  Most of you know who he is.
[01:33:51.566 --> 01:33:53.587]  I'm not going to go over his entire bio.
[01:33:54.027 --> 01:34:04.553]   It'd probably be better if he just condenses it down with his 40 plus years of experience and talk about his Patented models that have become the models of much of what's going on today.
[01:34:04.633 --> 01:34:11.338]  And now, of course, he was targeted by the system to stop him because he was creating disruptive technologies.
[01:34:11.378 --> 01:34:19.886]  We'll talk about the neocons, the central banks, what's happening in Russia, the collapse of Keynesian economics, which is behind the whole COVID scam.
[01:34:20.786 --> 01:34:23.529]  His war models predicted the current crisis in Ukraine.
[01:34:23.569 --> 01:34:27.653]  Unfortunately, the model is predicting a dire future for the global economy.
[01:34:28.013 --> 01:34:35.521]  And so to lay it all out is Martin Armstrong, armstrongeconomics.com and ask-socrates.com.
[01:34:35.761 --> 01:34:38.924]  Martin, been watching you for years and seeing you on all these great shows.
[01:34:39.004 --> 01:34:40.345]  I said, why aren't I getting him on?
[01:34:40.405 --> 01:34:42.908]  So thank you so much for coming on with us today.
[01:34:44.312 --> 01:34:45.713]  Oh, it's always a pleasure, Alex.
[01:34:46.293 --> 01:34:47.374]  Well, you're the expert.
[01:34:47.394 --> 01:34:48.094]  You've got the floor.
[01:34:48.174 --> 01:34:55.658]  Tell folks about who you are who don't know, who might have been hiding under a rock, and then let's get into the big story here, what you predicted coming through with this war.
[01:34:57.455 --> 01:35:08.098]  Well, I basically have been going, I was named like the International Hedge Fund Manager of the Year back in 98.
[01:35:08.238 --> 01:35:13.240]  I was always going head to head against Soros and the rest of them.
[01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:15.780]  And they didn't like that.
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:24.403]  And basically what they do is they tend to bribe government officials, etc.
[01:35:24.423 --> 01:35:25.343]  to get their own way.
[01:35:26.175 --> 01:35:29.097]  And I never really saw them as actually traders.
[01:35:29.898 --> 01:35:35.461]  I mean, even when Soros was going after the British pound, it was the British government that came to me about it.
[01:35:35.622 --> 01:35:40.225]  I mean, so it's been an interesting career.
[01:35:41.586 --> 01:35:55.315]  And basically what really took place is you have a group of really, they're, I call them, you know, they're the neocons.
[01:35:56.298 --> 01:35:58.099]  And they're on both sides of the aisle.
[01:35:59.979 --> 01:36:14.985]  And this whole thing with Russia actually began back in 2000, when they were trying to, the bankers had come up with this plan to take over Russia.
[01:36:16.156 --> 01:36:22.478]  And they got Yeltsin to basically steal $7 billion from the IMF loans.
[01:36:22.978 --> 01:36:30.780]  And as soon as they steered the wire through Bank of New York, they ran to the government and said, oh, Bank of New York just did a $7 billion money laundering.
[01:36:31.540 --> 01:36:40.562]  And then, you know, the feds ran in there and then they told Yeltsin that he had to resign or this was going to come out and that it was him.
[01:36:41.623 --> 01:36:47.008]  And they wanted to put in their little monkey, who was basically Baryshnovsky.
[01:36:48.048 --> 01:36:54.994]  And that's when Putin comes to power, because Yeltsin realized that this was all a setup.
[01:36:56.506 --> 01:37:09.772]  And I believe it was all approved, you know, actually by Hillary Clinton, which is why when Putin just, you know, put sanctions on everybody in the Biden White House, he also selected Hillary Clinton.
[01:37:10.212 --> 01:37:13.813]  And, you know, she called it a badge of honor, but I think it was well taken.
[01:37:16.354 --> 01:37:27.275]   Once Yeltsin realized that he was set up in August of 1999, That's when he turned to Putin, and that's how Putin came into power.
[01:37:27.956 --> 01:37:37.283]  And then what happened was, supposedly Putin said, okay, fine, you make me the head of Russia and I'll take care of everybody that's behind it.
[01:37:37.924 --> 01:37:46.591]  And so you have Edmund Safra, who is allegedly the brains behind the whole operation.
[01:37:46.671 --> 01:37:48.773]  He ran Republic National Bank.
[01:37:50.047 --> 01:37:58.974]  He was in partners with a guy you'll see all over the screens, you know, calling to sanction all the oligarchs, and that's Bill Browder.
[01:38:00.055 --> 01:38:09.282]  And the two of them were partners in Hermitage Capital, and they were asking me to bring over $10 billion to invest in this.
[01:38:09.602 --> 01:38:14.686]  And I said, no, my model says Russia's going to collapse.
[01:38:15.735 --> 01:38:19.836]  And they basically were the other way around.
[01:38:19.876 --> 01:38:25.157]  They had been put on a dinner in Washington D.C.
[01:38:26.717 --> 01:38:28.497]  and rented the whole National Gallery.
[01:38:28.637 --> 01:38:29.697]  It was for the IMF.
[01:38:30.398 --> 01:38:37.779]  I was invited down and it was basically to show me that they had even the IMF in their back pocket.
[01:38:38.639 --> 01:38:40.239]  And I said, I really don't care.
[01:38:40.339 --> 01:38:43.260]  My model says it's going the opposite way.
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:57.090]  In 1998, when they were attempting to go after Russian bonds, etc., and they were trying to get me in on that one, and I said no.
[01:38:58.111 --> 01:39:03.176]  And I gave a lecture at one of our conferences in London.
[01:39:04.389 --> 01:39:20.764]  And one of the guys from the London Financial Times happened to sneak in the back, and I didn't realize it, but, you know, the computer has done amazing forecasts on the rise and fall of empires and city-states, etc.
[01:39:20.845 --> 01:39:24.828]  So I stood up and I said, look, Russia is going to collapse, and I give it about 30 days.
[01:39:26.952 --> 01:39:34.538]  He then goes and puts it on the front page of the London Financial Times and of course Russia collapsed.
[01:39:35.579 --> 01:39:40.562]  They blame me and that ended up being long term capital management crisis.
[01:39:40.622 --> 01:39:46.507]  So I've been doing war with these people back and forth for a long time.
[01:39:47.598 --> 01:40:00.096]  And they've always tried to get me involved because instead of looking at it from our model perspective, they looked at it that we were, you know, maybe too influential.
[01:40:01.188 --> 01:40:08.693]  Back in 98, when I was managing money internationally, we had the equivalent of 50% of the U.S.
[01:40:08.753 --> 01:40:13.596]  national debt under contract back then that we were advising on.
[01:40:13.676 --> 01:40:17.318]  So we were probably the biggest advisors ever.
[01:40:18.239 --> 01:40:22.381]  And so that's why they were always kind of like trying to get me on their side.
[01:40:22.702 --> 01:40:29.766]  And so what we're looking at now is basically the same agenda.
[01:40:30.792 --> 01:40:37.294]  And these neocons are on both sides of the aisle.
[01:40:38.074 --> 01:40:46.116]  And what they're doing is, I mean, they were behind the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, Syria, etc.
[01:40:46.596 --> 01:40:51.277]  They can't sleep at night as long as an enemy is still breathing.
[01:40:52.279 --> 01:41:04.347]  And despite the fact that China is no longer a communist country, because communism means the government owns everything and they have, you know, billionaires themselves.
[01:41:04.887 --> 01:41:11.432]  So what you end up with is they still prefer to call it the communist China.
[01:41:12.032 --> 01:41:16.595]  And so this whole Ukrainian issue.
[01:41:18.064 --> 01:41:22.447]  In all honesty, it's very convenient.
[01:41:23.929 --> 01:41:38.301]  The whole COVID scam, I believe, was basically to try and get the world going because there's a real financial crisis developing that people don't know about.
[01:41:38.701 --> 01:41:40.383]  And that's in the central banks.
[01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:46.403]  You probably just heard that the Federal Reserve said it was going to raise interest rates.
[01:41:46.543 --> 01:41:47.543]  England said it would.
[01:41:49.064 --> 01:41:50.064]  Europe said no.
[01:41:50.204 --> 01:41:52.604]  they would maybe reduce some of their buying.
[01:41:52.604 --> 01:41:53.604]  Martin, stay there.
[01:41:53.604 --> 01:41:55.284]  We're going to come back and get to this.
[01:41:55.284 --> 01:42:00.684]   I'm not a famous economist like you, but I can see that they've created too much debt.
[01:42:00.684 --> 01:42:01.925]  There's too much monetization.
[01:42:01.925 --> 01:42:03.324]  People don't want more debt.
[01:42:03.324 --> 01:42:07.805]   They need a global crisis to be able to continue to pump up this bubble.
[01:42:07.813 --> 01:42:08.874]  And so they've gone from COVID.
[01:42:08.914 --> 01:42:09.734]  That started failing.
[01:42:10.154 --> 01:42:11.295]  So now they're going into a war.
[01:42:11.335 --> 01:42:13.996]  They even admit that they want a financial great reset.
[01:42:14.296 --> 01:42:16.797]  They're talking about digital currencies, world IDs.
[01:42:17.258 --> 01:42:19.919]  They obviously have some big financial event coming.
[01:42:20.339 --> 01:42:23.521]  I want to talk about that with you, what you think that is.
[01:42:24.281 --> 01:42:33.269]  And your models showing something even more dire for the future of the global economy and what the models show is going to be coming out of Russia.

[01:42:41.677 --> 01:42:42.758]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:42:42.778 --> 01:42:50.683]   And everything this guy's saying about himself, I remember in the newspapers, At the time, everything that happened, he was a political enemy and they grabbed him and, you know, sent him to the hoose cow for it.
[01:42:51.123 --> 01:42:52.825]  And now they're trying to do the same thing to me.
[01:42:53.305 --> 01:42:55.406]  When you get too influential, that's what happens.
[01:42:56.107 --> 01:43:00.349]  We'll be right back with our special guest, ArmstrongEconomics.com with Martin Armstrong.
[01:43:04.612 --> 01:43:11.216]  There's a lot of hype that Putin's going to get assassinated by his own government.
[01:43:12.725 --> 01:43:14.365]  Lindsey Graham is calling for him to do it.
[01:43:14.906 --> 01:43:15.746]  What is our guest?
[01:43:17.286 --> 01:43:18.766]  Martin Armstrong, think about that.
[01:43:18.846 --> 01:43:20.467]  Famous economist and modeler.
[01:43:21.707 --> 01:43:22.467]  Joining us now.
[01:43:24.988 --> 01:43:27.489]  Cutting right to the chase here, now that you've given us some background.
[01:43:27.629 --> 01:43:28.789]  What have your models shown?
[01:43:28.829 --> 01:43:30.449]  I know you did predict this conflict.
[01:43:30.989 --> 01:43:32.850]  And what are you expecting to happen now?
[01:43:33.270 --> 01:43:37.991]  You were getting into COVID and how they were getting ready to use that as kind of a financial reset.
[01:43:38.031 --> 01:43:39.111]  What comes out of that?
[01:43:39.691 --> 01:43:40.492]  What is their goal?
[01:43:40.532 --> 01:43:41.512]  What do you expect to see?
[01:43:43.359 --> 01:43:51.950]  Well, you have to understand that since World War II, they've been using Keynesian economics and abused it in a way.
[01:43:52.511 --> 01:43:56.816]  All they do is borrow year after year and never have any intention of paying anything back.
[01:43:57.797 --> 01:44:01.282]  The ECB in Europe went to negative interest rates in 2014.
[01:44:03.377 --> 01:44:05.940]  And I mean, it's crazy.
[01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:13.807]  I mean, we're approaching, you know, nine years and they've been unable to raise interest rates to stimulate the economy.
[01:44:14.328 --> 01:44:20.594]  So what's happening here is that the whole monetary system is collapsing and they know that.
[01:44:21.565 --> 01:44:24.647]  So this is part of this great reset.
[01:44:24.908 --> 01:44:29.291]  And I mean, as you know, I know, you know, Klaus Schwab.
[01:44:29.351 --> 01:44:31.232]  I mean, I've actually shaken hands with him.
[01:44:32.533 --> 01:44:38.118]  When he had his little movie, I was invited up for the grand opening that he had in New York.
[01:44:39.639 --> 01:44:42.101]  So I know what these people really are.
[01:44:42.501 --> 01:44:50.726]   And effectively, they're trying to Do almost a Hail Mary here.
[01:44:51.266 --> 01:45:00.331]  And you had Biden just try to threaten China not to support Russia.
[01:45:01.612 --> 01:45:08.396]  And this is really an attempt to take over Russia for regime change, etc.
[01:45:09.711 --> 01:45:24.356]  Uh, it's the, you have all this agenda coming out with, uh, the Ukrainian intelligence force saying, oh, you know, uh, even naming the person that's going to replace, uh, Putin.
[01:45:25.096 --> 01:45:28.837]  This is not, uh, this is propaganda.
[01:45:29.717 --> 01:45:38.560]  Because if somebody was really going to assassinate him, they wouldn't tell him in advance that this is going to happen and who's going to replace him.
[01:45:39.079 --> 01:45:41.764]  They're trying to lay the seed to get people to do this.
[01:45:42.425 --> 01:45:45.851]  It's regime change and this is what these people always do.
[01:45:46.452 --> 01:45:49.196]  And you just had Soros...
[01:45:50.450 --> 01:45:54.332]  Come out and say the same thing about China.
[01:45:54.892 --> 01:45:56.473]  That was just in the epic times.
[01:45:56.633 --> 01:46:05.357]  He says that basically China and Russia represent the danger to our civilization.
[01:46:05.397 --> 01:46:12.941]  He publicly called for Lindsey Graham and others to take out Xi Jinping and Putin, which really is pushing war, isn't it?
[01:46:13.861 --> 01:46:15.422]  Oh, it's absolutely.
[01:46:15.762 --> 01:46:20.675]   They think that they can just get Regime change without war.
[01:46:22.036 --> 01:46:24.678]  And I don't think that's going to be the case.
[01:46:25.739 --> 01:46:29.743]  You know, Putin is not the worst man in history.
[01:46:29.803 --> 01:46:34.687]  I mean, if they want to see somebody really pretty bad, bring in somebody like Stalin.
[01:46:34.727 --> 01:46:37.729]  I mean, he'll kill 10 million and then go out and have dinner.
[01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:43.975]  I mean, you know, there have been far worse than somebody like Putin.
[01:46:44.034 --> 01:46:46.034]  You know, just Putin or whatever he thinks.
[01:46:46.034 --> 01:46:48.034]  Well sure, but you bring up neocons, they're puppets.
[01:46:48.034 --> 01:46:52.034]  Bush Sr. and then Bush Jr. and Obama and Clinton.
[01:46:52.034 --> 01:46:58.034]   You've got all three of the living ones, Bush Jr., Clinton, and Obama,
[01:46:58.034 --> 01:47:04.034]   delivering wreaths to the Ukrainian churches and grandstanding about how this is Hitler,
[01:47:04.034 --> 01:47:08.034]   when 11 million people died from sanctions, not to mention war under them.
[01:47:07.399 --> 01:47:09.920]  I mean, these guys are frickin' war criminals compared to Putin.
[01:47:10.101 --> 01:47:16.745]  And I'm not defending everything Putin did, I'm just saying, this is like Satan, you know, saying that a guy that cheated on his wife is worse than him.
[01:47:17.126 --> 01:47:20.068]  Or, you know, Al Capone saying one of his lieutenants is worse than him.
[01:47:20.528 --> 01:47:21.869]  I mean, the dog doesn't hunt.
[01:47:22.069 --> 01:47:22.790]  It doesn't fly.
[01:47:22.990 --> 01:47:24.191]  The hypocrisy's a joke.
[01:47:25.788 --> 01:47:35.259]  Yeah, I mean, look, this is all about trying to, the way the neocons work, they have three stumbling blocks.
[01:47:35.319 --> 01:47:36.220]  First was Trump.
[01:47:37.121 --> 01:47:41.465]  And they basically had to launch a campaign that made people hate him.
[01:47:42.266 --> 01:47:44.769]  They're doing the same thing against Putin.
[01:47:45.390 --> 01:47:47.232]  You demonize the leader.
[01:47:47.981 --> 01:47:49.763]  And then you get people to hate them.
[01:47:49.783 --> 01:47:52.507]  And then that's what brings the change.
[01:47:53.168 --> 01:47:56.111]  The next target is Xi Jinping in China.
[01:47:57.032 --> 01:48:07.479]   Putin is just I totally agree with you, but let me tell you, the liberals I know like Putin more than they like Trump way more, and all the conservatives like him.
[01:48:08.139 --> 01:48:09.180]  I think that's dangerous.
[01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:10.200]  I don't think Putin's perfect.
[01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:22.503]  My point is, our system is so hated now, and our leaders are such liars, and Biden, this puppet, is so disliked that almost everyone I see and talk to, and everybody they talk to, actually likes Putin.
[01:48:23.904 --> 01:48:25.924]  So I don't think this is going well for the neocons.
[01:48:27.465 --> 01:48:28.105]  No, it's not.
[01:48:29.588 --> 01:48:31.813]  There's something very seriously wrong here.
[01:48:32.334 --> 01:48:43.500]   When you had these sanctions put on individuals, And they go, well, they're just the oligarchs.
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:50.325]  Well, no, actually, Czechoslovakia has just announced that they're seizing the property of all Russians.
[01:48:50.825 --> 01:48:56.569]  And they have to prove that they don't support Putin to get any of their own property back.
[01:48:56.990 --> 01:49:04.575]  And now the official head of all the ambulances, they have a national ambulance force, officially announced they're going to cut the testicles off of all Russians they find.
[01:49:06.308 --> 01:49:08.490]  It's just, it's complete insanity.
[01:49:08.550 --> 01:49:11.712]  Now, the problem is... So if anything is Hilarion, it's this.
[01:49:11.752 --> 01:49:23.460]  Look, look, the first man in space, Yuri Gagarin, they're taking his name out of books, out of publications, out of space groups, and saying the next person to go to space was the first because he's Russian.
[01:49:23.740 --> 01:49:26.722]  So this isn't just censorship, this is falsifying history now.
[01:49:28.292 --> 01:49:29.493]  Yes, it is.
[01:49:30.033 --> 01:49:38.379]  This is a full-blown propaganda routine, and it's to get people to hate Russians, period.
[01:49:39.639 --> 01:49:44.583]  I mean, Zelensky's a puppet in himself.
[01:49:44.703 --> 01:49:45.663]  It's crazy.
[01:49:46.424 --> 01:49:49.726]  And even to say that, oh, he should get the Nobel Peace Prize for what?
[01:49:50.622 --> 01:49:56.367]  You know, he has not done anything that he promised to reduce tensions with Russia at all.
[01:49:57.387 --> 01:50:08.196]  I know Ukrainians and a lot of them feel that he's just a puppet for somebody else who has deliberately put the rest of Ukraine in harm's way.
[01:50:08.816 --> 01:50:09.217]  For what?
[01:50:09.277 --> 01:50:13.360]  For two provinces that the Minsk agreement said they should have been allowed to vote?
[01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:16.962]  So it's just complete insanity.
[01:50:17.743 --> 01:50:29.750]  And by claiming that he should be getting the Nobel Peace Prize is, again, it's really just propaganda to make us all think that, oh, you know, that's the right side.
[01:50:29.810 --> 01:50:35.014]  And then it's going to be Russia and China and their evil.
[01:50:35.774 --> 01:50:38.216]  And this is World War Three stuff.
[01:50:39.148 --> 01:50:43.935]  She's using the assets of private individuals on the Russian side.
[01:50:44.335 --> 01:50:47.920]  The Chinese, honestly, they got to be sitting there looking at this.
[01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:48.802]  Hey, wait a minute.
[01:50:49.122 --> 01:50:50.985]  If they'll do it to them, they'll do it to us.
[01:50:52.026 --> 01:50:58.549]  So you're talking about not between two governments, you're talking about just confiscating all the assets of an individual.
[01:50:59.089 --> 01:51:10.753]  And now they're banning the name of the first man in space because he's Russian, and as you said, in Germany they're denying at government clinics, they're denying healthcare because people have Russian last names.
[01:51:10.813 --> 01:51:15.156]   I mean, this is the closest thing To Hitler, we've seen the last 75 years.
[01:51:15.737 --> 01:51:17.178]  Martin Armstrong, stay with us.
[01:51:17.278 --> 01:51:18.199]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:18.319 --> 01:51:19.520]  InfoWars.com.
[01:51:19.901 --> 01:51:24.925]  Tomorrow's news today, ArmstrongEconomics.com and Ask-Socrates.com.
[01:51:25.226 --> 01:51:32.132]  Don't forget, this important live interview, if you missed part of it, will be archived at Band.Video, where you can watch it, and most importantly, share it.
[01:51:33.735 --> 01:51:42.205]  Well, Martin Armstrong is a famous economist and modeler, and he definitely has earned his bones in many, many ways in the fights out there.
[01:51:42.666 --> 01:51:44.127]  ArmstrongEconomics.com.
[01:51:45.969 --> 01:51:48.753]  And yeah, there's no other way to dress this up.
[01:51:51.109 --> 01:51:58.492]  We are on the verge of a larger war that most analysts believe will go nuclear if things aren't de-escalated.
[01:51:59.073 --> 01:51:59.913]  You have Zelensky.
[01:51:59.953 --> 01:52:01.754]  Look, I'm not against homosexuals.
[01:52:01.774 --> 01:52:02.854]  I want to be 100% clear.
[01:52:02.894 --> 01:52:04.275]  I'm not attacking people.
[01:52:04.635 --> 01:52:05.776]  As long as they don't target children.
[01:52:06.796 --> 01:52:08.337]  That means heterosexual, homosexual, you name it.
[01:52:08.917 --> 01:52:16.721]  But Zelensky follows a model like Arnold Schwarzenegger and like Macron and others that they were sex toys.
[01:52:17.537 --> 01:52:18.777]  And that's the word.
[01:52:18.777 --> 01:52:24.416]   I mean, we know he did a lot of homoerotic gay movies and TV shows where he kisses men.
[01:52:24.416 --> 01:52:29.376]   And we can show the footage of him in black leather and high heels grabbing a man's butt.
[01:52:29.376 --> 01:52:33.657]   And I get joking around and, you know, you know, teasing, stuff like that.
[01:52:33.657 --> 01:52:36.657]  But this is particularly homoerotic.
[01:52:36.657 --> 01:52:39.457]  And my issue is that's how they compromise you.
[01:52:39.457 --> 01:52:40.976]  Just like Hunter Biden.
[01:52:40.976 --> 01:52:42.817]   If he wants to run around with a bunch of women, that's his issue.
[01:52:42.853 --> 01:52:46.977]  But they're underage, and there's video of it, and that's how he gets blackmailed.
[01:52:47.498 --> 01:52:55.386]  So that's my issue with this compromising and how these people continue, it turns out, to be sex operatives.
[01:52:56.087 --> 01:52:57.328]  People don't know about Schwarzenegger.
[01:52:58.089 --> 01:53:00.010]  I mean, I didn't just put it in a film about him.
[01:53:00.030 --> 01:53:01.892]  It wasn't the film that was about him, but it had a section.
[01:53:01.912 --> 01:53:04.374]  I actually checked it, and it was true.
[01:53:04.654 --> 01:53:09.098]  And it's in art collections, the Getty Museum, Arnold, and in gay porn.
[01:53:10.118 --> 01:53:13.982]  So, that's how they own these people, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:14.802 --> 01:53:19.544]  And that's how they get away with all this stuff, and that's how they control them.
[01:53:19.584 --> 01:53:22.946]  And so how big, Martin Armstrong, is the laptop?
[01:53:22.966 --> 01:53:25.067]  Because they denied it was real before, even though it was real.
[01:53:25.587 --> 01:53:27.528]  Now the New York Times says it's real, so it is.
[01:53:27.548 --> 01:53:30.070]  It's clear they're getting ready to try to dump Biden.
[01:53:30.430 --> 01:53:32.711]  I think maybe even assassinate him and blame a right winger.
[01:53:33.071 --> 01:53:36.193]  I mean, how do they take this horrible liability and turn it into a plus?
[01:53:36.753 --> 01:53:40.615]  And what are the danger trigger points to escalate the Russia war?
[01:53:41.275 --> 01:53:46.600]  Versus ways to de-escalate and a way for Putin to exit gracefully, face-saving.
[01:53:47.641 --> 01:53:49.022]  That's a gestalt of ideas.
[01:53:49.042 --> 01:53:50.023]  What do you want to tackle first?
[01:53:51.464 --> 01:53:57.969]  Well, I'm not so sure they're willing to let Putin escape here.
[01:53:58.049 --> 01:54:00.532]  I mean, the neocons really want this.
[01:54:00.792 --> 01:54:05.696]  They wanted Biden because he'll basically just sign anything that's in front of him.
[01:54:08.109 --> 01:54:17.573]  There are people, I think, starting to realize there is a bigger agenda here, which is why I think the laptop suddenly, oh, gee, I guess it was real.
[01:54:19.314 --> 01:54:22.875]  And there's a lot of conflicts of interest that are involved.
[01:54:22.975 --> 01:54:29.198]  I mean, Biden and the Clintons were doing the same thing.
[01:54:29.258 --> 01:54:35.763]   And you even have the other neocon that That died.
[01:54:36.184 --> 01:54:38.847]  McCain, he also had a foundation set up.
[01:54:39.387 --> 01:54:47.476]  He's the one that took Hillary's fake dossier that she made on Trump involving Russia.
[01:54:48.406 --> 01:54:54.548]  He's the one that handed it to Comey at the FBI, so it came from a Republican rather than a Democrat.
[01:54:54.988 --> 01:54:57.549]  I mean, they're all in on this together.
[01:54:58.069 --> 01:55:10.733]  By the way, that's the most important point you make to interrupt you, is that the neocons are not liberal, they're not conservative, they are fascist that actually came out of the Trotskyites and decided to go against the Russians.
[01:55:10.833 --> 01:55:14.394]  So it all goes back to Trotsky leaving, running to Mexico, getting killed.
[01:55:15.234 --> 01:55:23.859]  And then the head of the neocons dad converts and becomes this right winger, but then buys into Straussian economics at the Chicago Business School, who was a Nazi.
[01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:25.340]  I mean, these are some freaks.
[01:55:27.502 --> 01:55:32.825]  Yeah, I mean, the neocons are basically not the deep state.
[01:55:32.845 --> 01:55:37.428]  The deep state tends to be the agency's more on domestic stuff.
[01:55:38.340 --> 01:55:42.763]  The neocons transcend republic and democrats.
[01:55:43.504 --> 01:55:45.885]  And they are a government within the government.
[01:55:46.586 --> 01:55:49.408]  And they have been there for quite some time.
[01:55:49.488 --> 01:55:58.014]  They have been, I mean, you can even Google it, or look in Wikipedia on Johnson.
[01:55:58.334 --> 01:56:00.115]  They want world domination.
[01:56:00.275 --> 01:56:01.436]  They want world domination.
[01:56:02.836 --> 01:56:09.757]  Yeah, I mean, Johnson even said that, you know, well, all he knew was that perhaps they were shooting at whales that night.
[01:56:09.797 --> 01:56:11.238]  The Vietnamese never attacked.
[01:56:12.898 --> 01:56:16.018]  The same thing with weapons of mass destruction.
[01:56:16.098 --> 01:56:21.479]  I mean, all these things have been orchestrated to create war, which is what they want.
[01:56:21.499 --> 01:56:26.780]  What you're saying is the neocons go back to LL Emmonser and Curtis LeMay, who wanted to run Operation Northwoods.
[01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:36.591]   If I had to describe their beginning, yes, I would say that the neocons came out of Prescott Bush and his Nazi affiliates, and then
[01:56:36.591 --> 01:56:42.641]   L.L. Lemnitzer and the other Joint Chiefs of Staff staging the Gulf of Tonkin and staging other events. Well,
[01:56:42.641 --> 01:56:44.712]  they were out before them, but their adjuncts staged it.
[01:56:44.712 --> 01:56:51.001]   And then, of course, we know that Donald Rumsfeld was the Chief of Staff for Lemnitzer, and so you see that whole
[01:56:51.001 --> 01:56:51.712]  line there.
[01:56:51.712 --> 01:57:02.712]   Yeah, I mean, this is, you know, it's a view that if Russia's not evil, then why do you need NATO?
[01:57:02.712 --> 01:57:05.151]  Um, and it's.
[01:57:05.529 --> 01:57:07.971]  You have to understand, they have to have an enemy.
[01:57:08.511 --> 01:57:09.352]  They just have to.
[01:57:09.372 --> 01:57:11.333]  So this invasion is a wet dream for them.
[01:57:11.353 --> 01:57:12.154]  Why did Putin do it?
[01:57:12.174 --> 01:57:14.076]  Why did he walk into such an obvious trap?
[01:57:15.417 --> 01:57:27.594]   Well, basically they sent Harris over and on February 20th, she stood up and told I was basically in a conversation.
[01:57:27.694 --> 01:57:33.096]  She told Zelensky that the Ukrainians, they should join NATO.
[01:57:33.276 --> 01:57:40.958]  And four days later, basically you had the Russian invasion at that stage.
[01:57:41.598 --> 01:57:47.460]  I don't think that Putin realized what they were really planning to do.
[01:57:48.660 --> 01:57:54.202]  This is, I mean, the Belgrade agreement, most people don't know.
[01:57:55.276 --> 01:58:01.321]  But Ukraine was the third largest nuclear power in the world, had more nukes than China.
[01:58:02.482 --> 01:58:13.271]  And in 91, when the Soviet Union fell, they agreed, they gave up their nukes, they would not join NATO, and they would remain neutral between both.
[01:58:14.092 --> 01:58:15.954]  And that was the deal.
[01:58:16.434 --> 01:58:23.040]  And so by Harris suddenly standing up saying, oh, they should join NATO violated everything that was there.
[01:58:25.015 --> 01:58:32.379]  And I think it was delivered because they knew that was the main thing that would get Putin really up.
[01:58:32.599 --> 01:58:33.140]  Bingo!
[01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:33.680]  Dead on.
[01:58:33.700 --> 01:58:39.263]  And then Biden said, oh, I'm not going to do anything if you, you know, don't invade the whole country.
[01:58:39.624 --> 01:58:41.184]  And so now Putin's invaded half the country.
[01:58:41.245 --> 01:58:43.566]  I mean, they they signaled to Putin, go ahead and do it.
[01:58:45.127 --> 01:58:45.787]  Pretty much.
[01:58:45.947 --> 01:58:52.944]   I mean, And then they were saying, oh, he's losing because he hasn't taken the country in three days.
[01:58:53.305 --> 01:58:54.465]  He really didn't try.
[01:58:54.485 --> 01:59:03.867]  He was just taking the eastern part and he left even that column of tanks just sitting there as a threat.
[01:59:04.027 --> 01:59:08.529]   But he wasn't trying to actually occupy All of Ukraine.
[01:59:09.710 --> 01:59:12.791]  So in that sense, that was that was correct.
[01:59:12.871 --> 01:59:17.673]  I mean, this has been a real propaganda war.
[01:59:17.873 --> 01:59:25.496]  And I'm afraid that it's they think that they can get a regime change over there in Russia.
[01:59:26.036 --> 01:59:32.078]  And that somehow, miraculously, this is going to be the next peg in the Great Reset.
[01:59:32.418 --> 01:59:33.679]  And then they turn on China.
[01:59:34.735 --> 01:59:39.357]  China would be an absolute fool if they if they allow this to happen.
[01:59:40.897 --> 01:59:49.240]  If you know, they should be backing up really Russia at this stage, but they have said that they're their strategic partner.
[01:59:49.320 --> 01:59:59.623]  But I mean, you know, Biden then threatened the Chinese if you if you do that, you know, support Putin, then we're going to do the same thing to you.
[02:00:00.510 --> 02:00:02.792]  I mean, this is, you know, World War Three.
[02:00:02.892 --> 02:00:07.896]  Most people don't realize why did the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor?
[02:00:08.277 --> 02:00:10.439]  And that's because the U.S.
[02:00:10.659 --> 02:00:20.107]  also intervened and put an oil embargo and tried to cut off the energy to Japan, which is why they then attacked Pearl Harbor.
[02:00:21.215 --> 02:00:30.145]  So it was the same thing with sanctions then that started the Pacific War and it's going to be sanctions this time that does the same thing all over again.
[02:00:30.506 --> 02:00:38.275]  And we've got Zelensky saying attack Russia with a no-fly zone or there'll be nuclear war even though that would probably start a nuclear war.
[02:00:38.315 --> 02:00:42.960]   Final segment I really appreciate Martin Armstrong Coming on, one last segment, we come back.
[02:00:42.980 --> 02:00:52.587]  I want to ask you about the dire warnings, the economy and where you see this going and how people you think can protect themselves and any ways out of this with Martin Armstrong.
[02:00:53.168 --> 02:00:56.451]  We'll talk more about the collapse of the Keynesian economics and more.
[02:00:56.831 --> 02:00:58.552]  This guy is dead on, folks.
[02:00:58.652 --> 02:00:59.954]  ArmstrongEconomics.com.
[02:01:00.134 --> 02:01:02.015]  Ask-Socrates.com.
[02:01:03.296 --> 02:01:04.377]  Welcome back, folks.
[02:01:04.517 --> 02:01:09.762]  I was just talking to former InfoWars reporter Savannah Hernandez that works for Trump's Truth Social.
[02:01:11.260 --> 02:01:13.181]  She's going to be on the show tomorrow, Friday.
[02:01:13.241 --> 02:01:18.703]  She got the exclusive interview with the woman edged out and beaten by the man who got the gold medal.
[02:01:19.564 --> 02:01:21.845]  And she complained, so Twitter banned her account.
[02:01:22.225 --> 02:01:24.486]  Tucker Carlson played that interview, you're part of it, Friday.
[02:01:24.886 --> 02:01:25.947]  Savannah has even more.
[02:01:25.967 --> 02:01:27.747]  She's going to be airing with us tomorrow.
[02:01:28.128 --> 02:01:29.408]  She'll be on the show.
[02:01:30.048 --> 02:01:31.349]  And it is just crazy.
[02:01:31.389 --> 02:01:34.871]  Now the women that complain about a man competing, they get banned.
[02:01:35.451 --> 02:01:37.272]  What an insane tyranny.
[02:01:37.352 --> 02:01:42.778]   And then, I'm going to do a big report on this or I'm going to cover it tomorrow.
[02:01:43.359 --> 02:01:49.808]  Peter Daszak was involved in the labs, he is Ukrainian, that are there in Ukraine and other areas.
[02:01:49.968 --> 02:01:51.951]  It's in mainline documents and news.
[02:01:52.972 --> 02:01:55.676]  This is never broken though, it's in news before COVID.
[02:01:57.768 --> 02:01:59.569]  So this is Hiding in Plain View.
[02:02:00.290 --> 02:02:03.692]  We're going to be breaking it tomorrow, but everybody else is welcome to break it now.
[02:02:04.552 --> 02:02:05.173]  This is huge.
[02:02:05.193 --> 02:02:06.493]  Hell, I might just go in the war room today.
[02:02:06.513 --> 02:02:11.376]  We're out of time, pretty much, and we've got the great Gerald Cilenti about to take over, but this is all crazy.
[02:02:12.237 --> 02:02:13.958]  Martin Armstrong, let's get into the economy.
[02:02:13.978 --> 02:02:15.679]  Then I want to ask you about these labs as well.
[02:02:16.059 --> 02:02:18.321]  You talk about really bad economic numbers.
[02:02:18.801 --> 02:02:24.622]   This bubble, can they keep pumping it up, or are they going to use a global power outage, they claim that the Russians
[02:02:24.622 --> 02:02:29.363]   launched a cyber attack to reset things, all the central banks are on the news saying, "Soon your
[02:02:29.363 --> 02:02:33.202]   currency will be gone, you'll have an app on your phone with a new environmental
[02:02:33.202 --> 02:02:37.542]   currency, you've got to be for it or you're against the earth." They're clearly getting
[02:02:37.542 --> 02:02:39.582]  people ready for the new system to come in.
[02:02:39.582 --> 02:02:45.582]   What's happening? Well, you have to realize that, I mean, I was in New York
[02:02:47.823 --> 02:02:53.902]   a couple of months ago and the top banks in New York will no longer even lend money against
[02:02:53.902 --> 02:02:56.222]  European sovereign debt.
[02:02:56.391 --> 02:02:57.772]  That's how bad it's become.
[02:02:58.852 --> 02:03:14.298]  The repo crisis, which began in August of 2019, that was when the American banks were no longer willing to accept that type of collateral and deal with any European bank on a 24 hour basis.
[02:03:15.908 --> 02:03:20.690]  So that's forced the Fed to step in and take over the repo market.
[02:03:20.710 --> 02:03:25.932]  Well, now the New York banks won't even accept any government debt from Europe, period.
[02:03:26.853 --> 02:03:34.876]  Because, like I said, you've had negative interest rates since 2014, and they have been unable to ever stimulate the economy, period.
[02:03:34.956 --> 02:03:38.998]  So they know that this is going to be, it's going to go bust.
[02:03:39.750 --> 02:03:46.016]  Because what happens is in Europe, you have your pension funds were under law had to buy government debt.
[02:03:46.497 --> 02:03:50.060]  And when they bought the government debt, it was negative.
[02:03:50.641 --> 02:03:56.066]  So you've you've taken the pension funds and they're basically insolvent in Europe.
[02:03:57.104 --> 02:03:59.325]  And that is a complete disaster.
[02:03:59.425 --> 02:04:13.407]  So they know that if this goes completely bust, what's going to happen is that you're going to have millions of people storming the parliament down there with pitchforks, like, you know, some something out of the movie or Frankenstein or whatever.
[02:04:13.527 --> 02:04:25.630]  But so this whole thing is about they need the war to really create something that justification for Bretton Woods 3.
[02:04:27.430 --> 02:04:31.571]  And what they will do is they will default on all the debt.
[02:04:32.231 --> 02:04:36.953]  When Klaus Schwab is saying, you'll own nothing and you'll be happy.
[02:04:37.753 --> 02:04:43.775]  That is a fancy way of saying the government is really going to default.
[02:04:44.255 --> 02:04:48.236]  But they can't default unless they make you think they're doing it for you.
[02:04:49.321 --> 02:04:52.023]  So it's kind of like insurance.
[02:04:52.103 --> 02:04:55.446]  If you buy insurance, you buy accident insurance, fire insurance.
[02:04:55.786 --> 02:04:57.087]  But do you buy death insurance?
[02:04:57.547 --> 02:04:58.448]  They can't sell that.
[02:04:58.508 --> 02:04:59.429]  So they called it life.
[02:05:00.069 --> 02:05:02.631]  But are they really insuring you from living forever?
[02:05:02.771 --> 02:05:02.991]  No.
[02:05:04.292 --> 02:05:05.854]  So you just change the term.
[02:05:06.474 --> 02:05:16.762]  And that's what what he is means when he says you own nothing and you'll be happy is the cover because the government itself is going bust.
[02:05:17.501 --> 02:05:29.226]  So they want to eliminate paper money because people can then hoard their cash, keep it out of the banks, and that's what they want to stop.
[02:05:29.747 --> 02:05:34.689]  So what you have going on here is this whole covert agenda.
[02:05:35.422 --> 02:05:38.044]  And that's the digital currencies, etc.
[02:05:38.404 --> 02:05:49.550]  And people have to understand, even with the cryptocurrencies, they can seize everything in the blink of an eye, just as they're seizing yachts from oligarchs, etc.
[02:05:49.830 --> 02:05:53.032]  I mean... And as you said, they've now moved on to regular Russians.
[02:05:53.072 --> 02:05:57.894]  And Martin, I know you're giving us a boil-down, but everything you've said is just 100% of the money from my own research.
[02:05:57.914 --> 02:06:12.863]   But taking it to the next level, as you've done, I remember Soros and others five years ago saying, we're going to use Ukraine and a war there to lure Putin in, bragging that, you know, quote, we're going to make Russia part of the Soros kingdom.
[02:06:12.883 --> 02:06:13.783]  That's a quote he said.
[02:06:15.004 --> 02:06:21.567]  And he said, we're going to use the conflict for a new Marshall Plan for all of Europe, because the monetary system is going to go down.
[02:06:21.827 --> 02:06:25.289]  So he just said everything you're saying, this is a damn plan.
[02:06:25.569 --> 02:06:26.430]  How do we stop it?
[02:06:29.325 --> 02:06:31.687]  Well, Europe is beyond repair.
[02:06:32.087 --> 02:06:33.768]  I mean, it really is beyond repair.
[02:06:35.149 --> 02:06:39.232]  The EU will end up collapsing, really.
[02:06:39.272 --> 02:06:44.916]  You're going to end up with civil war and countries fighting against other countries.
[02:06:45.016 --> 02:06:46.457]  That's the bottom line.
[02:06:46.577 --> 02:06:48.619]  And the Muslims have already basically taken over.
[02:06:48.659 --> 02:06:50.600]  I've talked to people that travel to Europe, to Paris.
[02:06:51.181 --> 02:06:51.961]  It's a crap hole.
[02:06:52.041 --> 02:06:52.522]  It's ruined.
[02:06:52.802 --> 02:06:55.764]  Even out in the countryside, people just run out of the bushes with machetes.
[02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:03.345]  Yeah, no, look, last time I was in Paris, there's people begging you in absolutely every corner.
[02:07:05.386 --> 02:07:10.310]  It's really a complete disaster what they have created in Europe.
[02:07:11.191 --> 02:07:16.234]  And they thought, okay, we ban all this together and we'll be bigger in the United States.
[02:07:16.695 --> 02:07:20.097]  And they just have never done anything correctly, period.
[02:07:21.778 --> 02:07:31.513]   And so what you have to realize is that I seriously doubt that the euro will be still existing much beyond 2025.
[02:07:31.553 --> 02:07:37.495]  The system has to just crash and burn, and that's simply the way it is.
[02:07:38.135 --> 02:07:38.915]  I agree.
[02:07:38.955 --> 02:07:40.336]  So what happens to Klaus Schwab?
[02:07:40.416 --> 02:07:43.596]  It looks like his whole COVID plan is blowing up in his little ugly face.
[02:07:47.268 --> 02:07:48.069]  I will say this.
[02:07:48.209 --> 02:07:54.774]  I know for a fact that the whole COVID thing was also a organized scam.
[02:07:55.474 --> 02:07:57.836]  And our model picked it up in August of 2019.
[02:07:58.357 --> 02:08:07.664]  And I know for a fact that Klaus Schwab, we've called friends and told them before the crash that a virus was coming.
[02:08:09.611 --> 02:08:11.493]  We heard rumors of that in December.
[02:08:11.513 --> 02:08:17.218]  So, I mean, that was all planned and this is now just phase two.
[02:08:18.520 --> 02:08:26.948]  But, you know, we have to understand that this is, you know, what that is is to try and prevent people from going to work.
[02:08:28.527 --> 02:08:39.192]  Lockdowns where it gets them to work from home, eliminate cars, things of this nature, and then because the pension funds are all going to collapse, then what do you do?
[02:08:39.252 --> 02:08:41.413]  You replace that with guaranteed basic income.
[02:08:42.208 --> 02:08:46.071]  And this is just completely falling apart.
[02:08:46.831 --> 02:08:49.032]  The Fed never went negative.
[02:08:49.713 --> 02:08:53.916]  And the Federal Reserve is now basically the central bank of the world.
[02:08:53.936 --> 02:08:57.818]  So bottom line, the Great Reset isn't going the way they want.
[02:08:57.938 --> 02:08:58.799]  Correct me if I'm wrong.
[02:08:59.119 --> 02:09:00.820]  But so then what happens out of this?
[02:09:00.900 --> 02:09:04.562]  I mean, now that even their horrible plan is going to fall apart, what's going to come out of this?
[02:09:04.822 --> 02:09:05.943]  Sounds like total chaos.
[02:09:06.844 --> 02:09:10.286]  Yes, I think what you're going to end up with is World War Three.
[02:09:14.462 --> 02:09:21.415]  We're going to start seeing things along that line, I would say, even as early as the first quarter of next year.
[02:09:23.969 --> 02:09:39.056]  But I think we're headed towards a major reset, not the way Klaus wants it to happen, but I think the whole entire world economy is going to collapse and we're going to get a completely new type of government.
[02:09:39.937 --> 02:09:44.279]  I would like to see it move more towards a democracy, real democracy.
[02:09:44.379 --> 02:09:48.041]  We have republics at this stage, which are always the most corrupt.
[02:09:48.921 --> 02:09:51.822]  And our computer is basically saying that that is 2032 and beyond.
[02:09:53.707 --> 02:09:57.609]  And as far as Ukraine is concerned, it came out and I published.
[02:09:57.649 --> 02:09:59.510]  You can look at our site back in 2013.
[02:09:59.670 --> 02:10:01.711]  I said, Ukraine is the spot.
[02:10:01.911 --> 02:10:03.512]  That's where it all begins.
[02:10:04.093 --> 02:10:05.073]  No, I know you said that.
[02:10:05.113 --> 02:10:06.194]  People pointed that out to me.
[02:10:06.614 --> 02:10:09.415]  Well, Martin, let's not wait five, six years until you come on again.
[02:10:09.435 --> 02:10:11.056]  This has been such an incredible interview.
[02:10:11.096 --> 02:10:14.558]  Maybe in the next few weeks as things develop, pop back in with us.
[02:10:14.578 --> 02:10:17.640]  Ask-Socrates.com, ArmstrongEconomics.com.
[02:10:18.220 --> 02:10:19.441]  Thank you so much for your time, sir.
[02:10:20.546 --> 02:10:23.157]  Well, thank you, and yes, it'll be a pleasure to come back.
[02:10:23.398 --> 02:10:23.900]  Alright, thank you.
[02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:25.225]  Guys, get him on in the next few weeks, okay?
[02:10:25.506 --> 02:10:26.028]  Thank you, Martin.
[02:10:27.390 --> 02:10:29.751]  Oh my God, it's all true, it's all happening.
[02:10:30.071 --> 02:10:31.871]  Oh man, I'm so angry at these people.
[02:10:32.431 --> 02:10:33.111]  Oh my God.
[02:10:33.231 --> 02:10:35.012]  I mean, of course their plan's not going to work.
[02:10:36.412 --> 02:10:38.093]  And that's one reason I never joined them.
[02:10:38.353 --> 02:10:47.775]  A, I don't want to kill everybody and be part of this, but B, I mean, take everybody's resources and we'll all just roll over for environmental reasons and we all starve to death while you're rich?
[02:10:48.095 --> 02:10:50.036]  That's how you get giant wars!
[02:10:51.136 --> 02:10:53.616]  And then these globalists think they can make it out of this thing?
[02:10:54.377 --> 02:10:55.797]  These people are nuts.
[02:10:58.407 --> 02:11:00.329]  We have to expose them now.
[02:11:01.310 --> 02:11:02.972]  We have to call for peace now.
[02:11:03.533 --> 02:11:05.715]  And we have to stop the warmongers now.
[02:11:06.376 --> 02:11:10.181]  And all the trendy idiots now need to understand that they are fools!
[02:11:10.921 --> 02:11:13.985]  Bloomberg says kill your dog and cat to stop Putin.
[02:11:15.287 --> 02:11:17.249]  You can't make that up!
[02:11:19.431 --> 02:11:33.015]  Folks, we need funds to stay on air during this whole attack, and I'm just telling you right now, we got great products, we got some new products, we have our new super powerful immune booster that just came in, 25% off, immune support, our latest product, InfoWare Store.
[02:11:33.975 --> 02:11:45.738]  All right, I'm gonna do this before Gerald Cilente takes over, and I'm just gonna square up with the listeners and be completely frank with you about what's going on.
[02:11:47.608 --> 02:11:53.651]  I'm gonna do it in the last four minutes of this segment so we can put it on as a video that runs during the breaks.
[02:11:55.752 --> 02:11:56.793]  Here's what's going on.
[02:11:56.813 --> 02:12:02.956]  I got sued more than 50 times by the Democrats after Trump won, and we knocked out and defeated 46 of them.
[02:12:05.672 --> 02:12:12.477]  And we're down to four of the major lawsuits where Democrats sued us in completely rigged jurisdictions and with rigged courts.
[02:12:12.537 --> 02:12:13.877]  Just unbelievable over the top.
[02:12:14.718 --> 02:12:17.380]  In Connecticut, in New Haven, and in Austin, Texas.
[02:12:19.161 --> 02:12:31.729]  Now, I can sit there and keep battling them with the three Austin trials and one Connecticut trial through October of this year.
[02:12:32.209 --> 02:12:33.350]  That's four trials.
[02:12:33.390 --> 02:12:36.823]   They're doing Four different lawsuits with the Sandy Hook people.
[02:12:37.284 --> 02:12:40.244]  Two different law firms, all coordinated, to bankrupt us.
[02:12:41.345 --> 02:12:47.606]  And they know now, because of the courts ordering all this stuff that's unconstitutional, our finances, they know there's not extra money there.
[02:12:47.886 --> 02:12:49.327]  And they've told us, we don't care.
[02:12:49.627 --> 02:12:52.087]  We want you to be shut down.
[02:12:52.587 --> 02:12:54.188]  Or you can come out against the Second Amendment.
[02:12:54.208 --> 02:12:54.988]  They've actually told us that.
[02:12:55.728 --> 02:12:56.608]  And I'm not going to do that.
[02:12:57.389 --> 02:12:58.069]  It's very simple.
[02:12:59.190 --> 02:13:09.212]  So, I can go through the kangaroo trials with them, and do all that, and then appeal it, and hold them off another year or two, because their goal is to just come padlock and shut this place down.
[02:13:10.032 --> 02:13:14.213]  Or, we can just boycott their trials, and then they get their $500 million judgments.
[02:13:14.413 --> 02:13:15.193]  That's what they asked for.
[02:13:15.213 --> 02:13:20.434]  They asked the insurance company that Genesis has.
[02:13:20.454 --> 02:13:22.195]  I don't have liability insurance for speech.
[02:13:22.655 --> 02:13:24.235]  They said, we want $590 million.
[02:13:24.315 --> 02:13:25.195]  Excuse me, it's $590 million.
[02:13:25.215 --> 02:13:26.075]  Ted doesn't have $2 million.
[02:13:29.016 --> 02:13:40.080]  Okay, that's how out of control these people are, because when you're in a rigged game and know it's all rigged and known that, you know, it's all set up from the beginning with judicial tyranny, you can do stuff like that.
[02:13:40.260 --> 02:13:41.420]  They're not going to shut me up.
[02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:42.621]  I'm not going to be shut down.
[02:13:42.961 --> 02:13:45.802]  They can try to, you know, hurt this operation in this facility.
[02:13:45.862 --> 02:13:48.623]  But, oh, let me tell you, they're not going to silence anything.
[02:13:49.323 --> 02:13:57.411]   The point is, is that this crew and this infrastructure and all the reporters, And all the things that we do here that's so important needs to continue on.
[02:13:57.431 --> 02:13:58.952]  So I've decided to go ahead and battle it.
[02:13:59.292 --> 02:14:00.673]  And I've decided to go ahead and fight them.
[02:14:00.693 --> 02:14:03.594]  And I've decided to let them have their show trials and all the rest of it.
[02:14:03.634 --> 02:14:12.457]  And, you know, a judge that says we can't put on evidence because we're already guilty in a default, but we're going to have a jury trial about how guilty I am.
[02:14:12.917 --> 02:14:14.938]  So you're guilty, they just decide how guilty.
[02:14:15.698 --> 02:14:16.459]  Unbelievable.
[02:14:16.699 --> 02:14:17.360]  That's all fine.
[02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:18.121]  We'll let them do it.
[02:14:18.501 --> 02:14:20.584]  Every weapon formed against us will not prosper.
[02:14:20.884 --> 02:14:23.207]  Whatever the devil means for evil, God turns to good.
[02:14:23.547 --> 02:14:29.053]  I've seen this so many times, but we need the funds to go through these four trials.
[02:14:29.534 --> 02:14:32.557]  They want six to eight weeks in Connecticut for their extravaganza.
[02:14:33.057 --> 02:14:41.438]   In Austin they have BBC and HBO and the lawyers primping and the judge primping and coming
[02:14:41.438 --> 02:14:42.438]  in all excited.
[02:14:42.438 --> 02:14:43.577]  It's disgusting.
[02:14:43.577 --> 02:14:45.217]  They claim I live off Sandy Hook.
[02:14:45.217 --> 02:14:47.177]  They claim I made money off Sandy Hook.
[02:14:47.177 --> 02:14:49.018]  You know, this Elizabeth Williams writes a book about it.
[02:14:49.018 --> 02:14:50.018]  It's all over the news.
[02:14:50.018 --> 02:14:52.617]  Selling her book saying I made money off Sandy Hook.
[02:14:52.617 --> 02:14:53.617]  Never made money off that.
[02:14:53.617 --> 02:14:54.957]  Barely ever talked about it.
[02:14:54.957 --> 02:14:57.858]  These are a disgusting lot of leeches.
[02:14:57.858 --> 02:15:00.137]  Okay, these media people, these lawyers.
[02:15:00.987 --> 02:15:02.408]  Everybody sees them for what they are.
[02:15:02.768 --> 02:15:03.929]  Everybody gets what's happening.
[02:15:04.209 --> 02:15:06.731]  It's all turning to crap in their hands.
[02:15:07.271 --> 02:15:09.053]  But I need funds to fight this war.
[02:15:09.593 --> 02:15:10.494]  This information war.
[02:15:10.554 --> 02:15:12.616]  So, it's very simple.
[02:15:12.956 --> 02:15:14.677]  All of our work's coming to a head right now.
[02:15:14.817 --> 02:15:18.680]  Every day we're having major breakthroughs and just doing incredible things.
[02:15:18.700 --> 02:15:19.361]  Thanks for your support.
[02:15:20.148 --> 02:15:21.729]  But I need more capital now than ever.
[02:15:21.749 --> 02:15:24.270]  We had to build our own infrastructure, our own bandwidth, our own everything.
[02:15:24.750 --> 02:15:26.190]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:15:27.091 --> 02:15:34.594]  Go there and that will, by buying the products, pay for the 5, 6, 7, 8 million views a day we get at Mandot Video.
[02:15:35.174 --> 02:15:40.156]  And that'll pay for the broadcast here and the infrastructure and all of this that's hurting the New World Order.
[02:15:40.956 --> 02:15:42.137]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:15:42.157 --> 02:15:43.978]  We have 75% off right now.
[02:15:44.378 --> 02:15:48.661]  Massive clearance sale to fund this legal defense of this battle and we're never going to give up.
[02:15:48.861 --> 02:15:50.782]  We're never going to get it in, but we could give out.
[02:15:51.183 --> 02:15:54.765]  So we need your financial support now at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:15:55.085 --> 02:15:57.307]  Don't wait and I salute you and thank you all.
[02:15:58.223 --> 02:16:01.888]  Now, Gerald Solente is loaded and ready.
[02:16:01.948 --> 02:16:04.491]  He's always been on fire, known this guy 20 years.
[02:16:05.032 --> 02:16:07.214]  And by the way, Gerald, I changed phone numbers.
[02:16:07.235 --> 02:16:09.317]  I just learned you were trying to get a hold of me, so I'll call you today.
[02:16:09.337 --> 02:16:09.958]  I apologize.
[02:16:10.298 --> 02:16:14.378]   He's about to take over on the other side of this amazing break.
[02:16:14.378 --> 02:16:27.978]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022.
[02:16:28.555 --> 02:16:47.291]  And in the month of February, we had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product, X3, that has all three types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity in your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much.
[02:16:47.411 --> 02:16:51.015]  And the majority of the population in the world is iodine deficient.
[02:16:51.315 --> 02:16:52.736]  This is the very best iodine out there.
[02:16:52.876 --> 02:16:56.958]  So, we had it on sale 50% off, but we sold more than half of what we have.
[02:16:57.438 --> 02:17:01.340]  More isn't going to come in for a long time, so I took it back to full price.
[02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:02.581]  And I was just thinking, you know what?
[02:17:02.961 --> 02:17:04.862]  We need the funds in now to stay on air.
[02:17:05.282 --> 02:17:07.163]  Plus, this is a great product everybody needs.
[02:17:07.664 --> 02:17:16.748]  So to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get X3 and experience it for yourself and support the broadcast, I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out.
[02:17:17.209 --> 02:17:20.570]  Get X3 right now exclusively at Infowarestore.com for 50% off.
[02:17:22.950 --> 02:17:24.131]  Hello, hello, hello.
[02:17:24.171 --> 02:17:26.271]  Great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:17:26.952 --> 02:17:30.693]  Listen, what Alex just said to you, this is 100% important.
[02:17:31.954 --> 02:17:36.276]  They're banning everybody, every place, name the place, name the country.
[02:17:36.296 --> 02:17:38.477]  It's censorship.
[02:17:40.598 --> 02:17:43.679]  You weren't allowed to say, no, I don't want to get a vaccine.
[02:17:43.719 --> 02:17:46.120]  What do you mean you don't want to get a vaccine?
[02:17:46.540 --> 02:17:47.961]  Who the hell are you?
[02:17:48.541 --> 02:17:49.822]  Don't you know who I am?
[02:17:50.959 --> 02:17:53.961]  Oh yeah, I'm Rachel, uh, what's her name?
[02:17:54.021 --> 02:17:54.502]  Levin.
[02:17:55.402 --> 02:17:56.263]  Oh, the Admiral!
[02:17:56.303 --> 02:17:59.525]  Yeah, there's the Admiral, more chins than Chinatown.
[02:17:59.926 --> 02:18:01.307]  Or is it the Rear Admiral?
[02:18:02.948 --> 02:18:05.590]  Because they're really giving it to us.
[02:18:06.330 --> 02:18:16.398]  You cannot, how dare you say anything that that guy, that's a epitome of non-health, will tell you what to do.
[02:18:19.474 --> 02:18:24.455]  They're banning everybody from saying anything that they don't want you to hear.
[02:18:26.376 --> 02:18:28.857]  If we don't unite, we're finished.
[02:18:29.517 --> 02:18:29.997]  Finished!
[02:18:31.577 --> 02:18:36.299]  With Alex Jones, the InfoWars crew is putting up there, you're not getting anywhere.
[02:18:36.999 --> 02:18:37.919]  Not getting anywhere.
[02:18:39.960 --> 02:18:42.200]  So do what you can to support InfoWars.
[02:18:42.260 --> 02:18:43.361]  Their products are great.
[02:18:44.141 --> 02:18:47.882]  And I buy them, I don't put my money where my mouth is, you know, I do both.
[02:18:48.576 --> 02:18:50.857]  Put my money, my heart, my soul in my mouth is.
[02:18:51.478 --> 02:18:54.800]  And they got all these great specials going on, these blowout sales.
[02:18:55.380 --> 02:18:59.182]  And of course, to me, I like that super male vitality.
[02:18:59.362 --> 02:19:01.043]  Got to keep that super male going.
[02:19:01.284 --> 02:19:08.928]  Let me tell you something, as a cat that's 75 years old, everybody listening, the older you get, the more you have to do.
[02:19:09.569 --> 02:19:11.690]  I work out now more than I ever used to.
[02:19:13.071 --> 02:19:16.873]  So, and these Infowar products, you're going to need more and more.
[02:19:17.788 --> 02:19:19.649]  Because they're going to rob us of our future.
[02:19:20.090 --> 02:19:22.131]  Just like they took us into the COVID war.
[02:19:22.531 --> 02:19:23.772]  Everybody marched.
[02:19:23.912 --> 02:19:24.773]  Everybody marched.
[02:19:25.093 --> 02:19:26.154]  And that's what they called it.
[02:19:26.174 --> 02:19:27.475]  They called it the COVID war.
[02:19:27.775 --> 02:19:32.358]  You read our magazine, the Trends Journal, as they began it from Trump, one after another.
[02:19:32.658 --> 02:19:33.199]  It's a war.
[02:19:33.239 --> 02:19:34.019]  We're fighting a war.
[02:19:34.279 --> 02:19:35.380]  It's not a war.
[02:19:35.961 --> 02:19:36.721]  Oh yeah, it's a war.
[02:19:36.761 --> 02:19:38.282]  It's a war against the drug lords.
[02:19:38.342 --> 02:19:38.843]  I forgot.
[02:19:39.183 --> 02:19:40.564]  Oh yeah, you never beat the drug lords.
[02:19:40.604 --> 02:19:41.384]  What's wrong with me?
[02:19:42.345 --> 02:19:45.047]  Just like they took us to that war and everybody followed.
[02:19:45.669 --> 02:19:48.613]  They're doing the same thing now with the war in Ukraine.
[02:19:49.875 --> 02:19:51.056]  Let's hate the Russians.
[02:19:51.116 --> 02:19:56.163]  Let's hate the Russians without knowing any of the facts, any place, anywhere on Earth.
[02:19:56.984 --> 02:19:58.967]  Just swallow the crap that they've given us.
[02:19:59.467 --> 02:19:59.748]  Oh, yeah.
[02:19:59.808 --> 02:20:00.068]  Oh, yeah.
[02:20:00.088 --> 02:20:01.570]  You want to talk about war murderers?
[02:20:01.970 --> 02:20:02.491]  Here they are.
[02:20:02.511 --> 02:20:03.673]  Here they are.
[02:20:04.508 --> 02:20:09.170]  The Nobel piece-of-crap prize winner, ladies and gentlemen, or I should say folks.
[02:20:09.890 --> 02:20:10.270]  Folks?
[02:20:10.931 --> 02:20:12.991]  Yeah, who's always folking us all the time?
[02:20:13.372 --> 02:20:14.452]  Barack Obama.
[02:20:14.752 --> 02:20:15.432]  What did he kill?
[02:20:15.452 --> 02:20:15.712]  How many?
[02:20:16.113 --> 02:20:17.773]  Oh, quote, I'm really good at killing people.
[02:20:18.354 --> 02:20:19.294]  Oh, that war criminal?
[02:20:19.754 --> 02:20:22.975]  No, no, you mean George W. Bush.
[02:20:23.396 --> 02:20:26.797]  Another little daddy's boy, born on third base, thought he had a home run.
[02:20:27.117 --> 02:20:29.518]  A little guy with cojones smaller than a mothball.
[02:20:29.818 --> 02:20:31.339]  A little nothing of a clown.
[02:20:31.760 --> 02:20:33.301]  How many people do you kill over there?
[02:20:33.361 --> 02:20:34.001]  War crime?
[02:20:34.462 --> 02:20:35.062]  War crime?
[02:20:35.322 --> 02:20:35.682]  How come?
[02:20:35.983 --> 02:20:36.763]  Where's the media?
[02:20:36.903 --> 02:20:37.204]  How come?
[02:20:37.284 --> 02:20:38.084]  Oh, there he is.
[02:20:38.244 --> 02:20:38.585]  Folks.
[02:20:39.065 --> 02:20:39.706]  He was so good.
[02:20:39.886 --> 02:20:40.226]  Folks.
[02:20:40.386 --> 02:20:40.726]  Folks.
[02:20:41.187 --> 02:20:41.407]  Yeah.
[02:20:41.647 --> 02:20:43.388]  Hope and change you could believe in.
[02:20:43.769 --> 02:20:44.049]  Yeah.
[02:20:44.189 --> 02:20:45.210]  Change of a penny.
[02:20:45.570 --> 02:20:46.771]  Mission accomplished.
[02:20:47.031 --> 02:20:52.855]  That little clown, all dressed up in his military drag, flying onto an aircraft carrier.
[02:20:53.196 --> 02:20:54.417]  Mission accomplished in Iraq.
[02:20:55.237 --> 02:21:03.443]  Mission accomplished the killing between 800,000 and 1.2 million civilians, according to his data you look at.
[02:21:04.243 --> 02:21:08.126]  And look at MIT, yeah, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
[02:21:08.146 --> 02:21:10.268]  Yeah, they'll give you some real numbers.
[02:21:11.108 --> 02:21:13.250]  Oh, but those Russians are killing civilians.
[02:21:13.630 --> 02:21:15.511]  Oh, they're not murderers like Bush.
[02:21:17.352 --> 02:21:18.933]  I forgot Clinton.
[02:21:20.034 --> 02:21:20.735]  Oh yeah!
[02:21:21.559 --> 02:21:23.721]  Bill Pecker Clinton!
[02:21:24.461 --> 02:21:28.944]  Every time he got caught with his pants down, it's bombs away over Iraq!
[02:21:28.964 --> 02:21:33.587]  They're gonna take us to war!
[02:21:35.589 --> 02:21:36.990]  They're gonna take us to war!
[02:21:37.410 --> 02:21:40.492]  The military-industrial complex is getting all our dough!
[02:21:42.093 --> 02:21:44.915]  That idiot, moron, stupid jerk!
[02:21:46.416 --> 02:21:46.937]  Biden!
[02:21:48.178 --> 02:21:48.758]  And there he is!
[02:21:48.778 --> 02:21:50.099]  Look at that guy!
[02:21:50.836 --> 02:21:51.616]  Boy, man!
[02:21:52.497 --> 02:21:55.979]  You gotta... Could you imagine?
[02:21:56.679 --> 02:22:01.041]  It's like that chick that was having the affair with that guy Zucker.
[02:22:02.102 --> 02:22:05.964]  Boy, you must have been paid a lot to put out for these guys, man!
[02:22:06.884 --> 02:22:07.285]  Yeah!
[02:22:07.865 --> 02:22:08.265]  Look at them!
[02:22:08.885 --> 02:22:09.266]  Look at them!
[02:22:10.246 --> 02:22:11.407]  Look who's telling us what to do!
[02:22:11.647 --> 02:22:13.828]  Oh, Madeline not all that bright over there, huh?
[02:22:14.949 --> 02:22:15.189]  Yeah.
[02:22:15.709 --> 02:22:16.389]  You remember her?
[02:22:16.670 --> 02:22:17.490]  On 60 Minutes?
[02:22:18.090 --> 02:22:19.211]  Telling Leslie Stahl?
[02:22:20.160 --> 02:22:31.166]  The price of over 500,000 Iraqi children under the age of five killed by Bill Clinton, the murderous Bill Clinton was worth the price.
[02:22:31.747 --> 02:22:31.987]  Yeah.
[02:22:32.507 --> 02:22:34.008]  Madeline, not all that bright.
[02:22:34.308 --> 02:22:39.071]  How could we be so stupid to listen to these people?
[02:22:39.911 --> 02:22:40.992]  Oh, look at them.
[02:22:41.733 --> 02:22:44.074]  I'll tell you a quick Madeline, not all that bright story.
[02:22:45.595 --> 02:22:48.777]  About 2002, I'm a keynote speaker on the QE2.
[02:22:50.618 --> 02:22:55.221]  And it was to the top, top marketing executives from around the world.
[02:22:56.302 --> 02:23:01.406]  And one of them was, I get people from like BMW, all the biggest places.
[02:23:02.447 --> 02:23:05.189]  And so Madeleine Albright leads it off the first night.
[02:23:05.249 --> 02:23:08.351]  The ship is still on the west side of New York dock there.
[02:23:08.931 --> 02:23:10.152]  And she comes the first night.
[02:23:13.054 --> 02:23:15.176]  She starts, they give her an introduction.
[02:23:15.216 --> 02:23:16.697]  This is Madeleine Albright.
[02:23:17.330 --> 02:23:18.470]  We're not all that bright.
[02:23:19.010 --> 02:23:20.851]  Grew up in Czechoslovakia.
[02:23:21.151 --> 02:23:23.491]  Her father was this, her mother was that.
[02:23:23.991 --> 02:23:25.852]  She went to this school, that school.
[02:23:25.872 --> 02:23:27.772]  Her father did this, her mother did that.
[02:23:28.172 --> 02:23:29.693]  She graduated with this.
[02:23:29.813 --> 02:23:31.433]  Had this honor and that honor.
[02:23:31.473 --> 02:23:33.093]  Did this, did that, did this, did that.
[02:23:33.473 --> 02:23:36.214]  Did that, did that, did dee-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-boop-ba-ba-ba-ba.
[02:23:36.574 --> 02:23:39.715]  It went on, I'm not BSing, for maybe 15 minutes.
[02:23:41.494 --> 02:23:45.777]  And here she is, all dressed up in red, with this facha bruta.
[02:23:45.797 --> 02:23:48.439]  Oh, and she looked like the Queen of Tarts.
[02:23:50.260 --> 02:23:53.523]  So the next day, on the keynote, I leave the thing off.
[02:23:55.143 --> 02:24:05.811]  And they introduced me, you know, this is Gerald Salenti, he's the author of Trend Tracking, Far Better Than Megatrends, Time Magazine, founder and director of the Trends Research Institute.
[02:24:06.191 --> 02:24:08.232]  This is what The Economist says about him.
[02:24:08.273 --> 02:24:13.156]  This is what The Wall Street Journal, Time Magazine, you know, one after another.
[02:24:14.077 --> 02:24:14.977]  Nice introduction.
[02:24:15.618 --> 02:24:18.780]  Author of Trends 2000, international bestselling book.
[02:24:20.201 --> 02:24:21.382]  And I get up on the stage.
[02:24:21.422 --> 02:24:24.004]  Thank you very much, John, for that nice introduction.
[02:24:24.744 --> 02:24:30.128]  But I said, I felt shortchanged after hearing Madeleine Albright's introduction yesterday.
[02:24:30.508 --> 02:24:31.649]  And the place broke up.
[02:24:32.289 --> 02:24:33.130]  The place broke up.
[02:24:33.150 --> 02:24:33.610]  Look at this.
[02:24:33.670 --> 02:24:35.931]  Look at these people that are telling her what to do.
[02:24:36.091 --> 02:24:38.073]  Albright, not all that bright.
[02:24:38.373 --> 02:24:41.195]  Not just evil, evil, evil.
[02:24:41.575 --> 02:24:43.196]  Look at the facha bruta.
[02:24:43.797 --> 02:24:44.077]  Evil.
[02:24:44.757 --> 02:24:46.198]  So I said, listen, that was it.
[02:24:46.338 --> 02:24:49.640]  But I said, I feel shortchanged after her introduction.
[02:24:50.441 --> 02:24:59.243]   So you fail to mention Was that I graduated PS 76 in the Bronx, without honors, and brought down the house.
[02:24:59.984 --> 02:25:01.644]  Anyway, I've been around these people.
[02:25:02.424 --> 02:25:04.765]  I've been with princes, prime ministers, and presidents.
[02:25:08.407 --> 02:25:11.968]  Eisenhower, Dwight D. Eisenhower, five-star general, says it all.
[02:25:13.709 --> 02:25:19.231]  Any man seeking the office of president, you could Google this up, is either an egomaniac or crazy.
[02:25:20.211 --> 02:25:22.752]  And then you could go down the line with all the politicians.
[02:25:24.173 --> 02:25:32.715]  How could anybody with a brain bigger than a pea listen to the crap shooting out of Cruz's mouth, out of Obama's mouth, out of little boy Bushy's mouth?
[02:25:33.235 --> 02:25:51.160]  This is a real man, Dwight D. Eisenhower, five-star general, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, that warns us on January 1961 that the military-industrial complex is robbing the nation of the genius of the scientists, the sweat of the laborers, and the future of the children.
[02:25:53.678 --> 02:25:55.340]  Yesterday I had to go down in New York.
[02:25:55.861 --> 02:25:57.763]  I'm up in Kingston, about 90 miles down.
[02:25:58.124 --> 02:26:03.331]  And I don't like, here we go, any man who wants to be president, now you say, is either an ego maniac or crazy.
[02:26:04.873 --> 02:26:06.395]  So, you know, I don't like taking the true way.
[02:26:06.415 --> 02:26:07.176]  I hate these roads.
[02:26:07.256 --> 02:26:10.340]  So I take, you know, the kind of old roads down to the city.
[02:26:11.115 --> 02:26:17.659]  Pothole, after pothole, after pothole, after pothole, after pothole, after pothole.
[02:26:18.099 --> 02:26:26.064]  Oh, but we could send $18.6 billion of our dough to the Ukraines to fight a losing war against the Russians.
[02:26:26.685 --> 02:26:28.646]  Again, I'm totally opposed to the invasion.
[02:26:28.966 --> 02:26:30.247]  I launched Occupy Peace.
[02:26:30.527 --> 02:26:32.108]  You're not going to beat the Russians.
[02:26:32.428 --> 02:26:33.789]  What am I, six years old?
[02:26:34.530 --> 02:26:42.111]   Napoleon couldn't beat them sending, what, two hundred and 40,000 troops out of Poland in 1812?
[02:26:43.432 --> 02:26:44.132]  Famous chart.
[02:26:44.633 --> 02:26:45.954]  Comes back with 10,000.
[02:26:47.115 --> 02:26:49.036]  Operation Barbarossa by Hitler.
[02:26:50.017 --> 02:26:53.900]  Kills 27 million Russians!
[02:26:54.801 --> 02:27:03.868]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show, and everybody, what Alex is saying, and the staff, they're censoring everybody that doesn't buy the line.
[02:27:04.709 --> 02:27:06.330]  And this is nothing new, by the way.
[02:27:08.450 --> 02:27:09.351]  There's nothing new.
[02:27:10.412 --> 02:27:12.674]  There's fairness and accuracy in reporting.
[02:27:12.834 --> 02:27:13.234]  Fair.
[02:27:13.995 --> 02:27:17.218]  They did a study going back when the Iraq War began.
[02:27:18.359 --> 02:27:30.430]  How few people the major media put up that put out information that showed that Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction or ties to al-Qaeda.
[02:27:32.632 --> 02:27:33.213]  Blackballed!
[02:27:35.348 --> 02:27:46.715]  And the toilet paper of record, the New York Times, they call themselves the paper record, but all it is is just to, you know, it's good to wipe crap because that's all they do is sell.
[02:27:47.336 --> 02:27:51.278]  They sold the lies of the uranium tubes and this and that.
[02:27:52.419 --> 02:27:57.082]  They blackball everybody that is against a narrative of war.
[02:28:00.089 --> 02:28:03.912]  There he is, little Colin Powell, holding a colon.
[02:28:03.932 --> 02:28:05.634]  You know what goes through the colon?
[02:28:06.094 --> 02:28:06.534]  Crap.
[02:28:07.195 --> 02:28:12.299]  Crap goes through the colon, and there he is, holding his colon.
[02:28:13.099 --> 02:28:13.500]  Crap.
[02:28:14.180 --> 02:28:24.709]  Lying to the people, and dumb enough, dumb enough for people to believe, and I'll never forget that day, he's at the UN, holding that little thing up, and people actually swallowed it.
[02:28:26.750 --> 02:28:26.991]  Yeah.
[02:28:27.591 --> 02:28:28.352]  War criminals.
[02:28:29.750 --> 02:28:33.492]  How come they haven't brought Bush up, Clinton up, Obama up?
[02:28:34.012 --> 02:28:36.173]  I want that guy Assad out of there.
[02:28:36.473 --> 02:28:37.553]  The guy in Syria.
[02:28:37.874 --> 02:28:43.056]  We've only killed, at the United States' help, about 630,000 Syrians.
[02:28:43.896 --> 02:28:44.477]  Oh, Libya?
[02:28:44.497 --> 02:28:47.138]  I want that guy Qaddafi out of there.
[02:28:47.498 --> 02:28:48.718]  Qaddafi must go.
[02:28:48.778 --> 02:28:49.999]  That's Obama's words.
[02:28:50.739 --> 02:28:51.680]  Out of folks?
[02:28:52.160 --> 02:28:52.500]  Folks?
[02:28:52.600 --> 02:28:54.021]  That was out of his mouth.
[02:28:56.989 --> 02:28:59.651]  Libya, the richest country in Africa.
[02:29:02.293 --> 02:29:02.793]  On and on.
[02:29:04.174 --> 02:29:07.197]  So, now you got moron Biden.
[02:29:08.678 --> 02:29:12.581]  Oh, and both the Democrats and the Republicans want more war.
[02:29:13.201 --> 02:29:20.707]  Very few are voting against taking more of our money as what, 60% of the people living paycheck to paycheck.
[02:29:21.207 --> 02:29:22.668]  I filled up my car yesterday.
[02:29:22.688 --> 02:29:23.689]  80 bucks?
[02:29:25.839 --> 02:29:29.320]  $80?
[02:29:26.039 --> 02:29:29.320]  You know, I could afford it.
[02:29:30.781 --> 02:29:32.421]  But how about people who are working, you know?
[02:29:33.882 --> 02:29:34.102]  Yeah.
[02:29:34.462 --> 02:29:34.842]  Who's that?
[02:29:35.322 --> 02:29:35.823]  Hey, Lindsey.
[02:29:35.843 --> 02:29:37.343]  Now, there's a tough guy.
[02:29:37.363 --> 02:29:40.304]  Hey, Lindsey, did you come out of the closet yet, Graham?
[02:29:40.564 --> 02:29:41.505]  You want to go fight?
[02:29:41.745 --> 02:29:44.906]  Oh, this is the guy that wants to get Putin assassinated?
[02:29:45.406 --> 02:29:54.607]   Could you imagine if you had a bunch of Russian people saying they should assassinate Bush, Clinton, and Obama for the wars that they've started?
[02:29:54.627 --> 02:29:57.189]  The war crimes that the people they've killed?
[02:30:01.012 --> 02:30:01.712]  Look at the people.
[02:30:02.093 --> 02:30:03.273]  Little Chucky Schumer.
[02:30:04.494 --> 02:30:04.735]  Yeah.
[02:30:05.015 --> 02:30:06.376]  Little Chucky Shoebox.
[02:30:07.237 --> 02:30:07.977]  A little nothing.
[02:30:08.838 --> 02:30:09.058]  Yeah.
[02:30:09.899 --> 02:30:12.961]  Graham Riddy has called for someone to assassinate Putin.
[02:30:13.341 --> 02:30:14.102]  A fat face.
[02:30:14.122 --> 02:30:14.983]  You want to go kill him?
[02:30:15.003 --> 02:30:15.463]  Go kill him.
[02:30:16.232 --> 02:30:23.954]  Anybody that wants to support the war, dress up, lead the charge, get the hell out of here, it ain't my money, I don't want to go in there.
[02:30:24.954 --> 02:30:29.415]  What's going on between Russia and Ukraine has been going on what?
[02:30:29.715 --> 02:30:32.796]  That may be several hundred years, or maybe a thousand.
[02:30:33.716 --> 02:30:39.578]  The neighboring countries, look at this clowns, look at these, look at these jerks, look at these, is this a guy, Rish?
[02:30:41.482 --> 02:30:42.743]  Look, one jerk after another.
[02:30:43.063 --> 02:30:48.845]  How could anybody with a brain bigger than a pea swallow the crap shooting out of these fatheads' mouths?
[02:30:50.285 --> 02:30:51.926]  So now they put sanctions on us.
[02:30:52.206 --> 02:30:53.446]  I mentioned gas prices.
[02:30:55.667 --> 02:31:00.869]  Oh, and now the Houthis just had a place in Saudi Arabia, one of their oil depots.
[02:31:02.558 --> 02:31:08.601]  Oh, Saudi Arabia, you mean along with the United States, that has caused the worst humanitarian crisis on earth in Yemen?
[02:31:08.901 --> 02:31:11.062]  When they launched a war out of Washington, D.C.
[02:31:11.462 --> 02:31:19.265]  under the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winners regime, back in March of 2015, and our U.S.
[02:31:19.305 --> 02:31:32.626]   Secretary of State, Secretary of State, Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, went over to Saudi Arabia back then to give them Yep.
[02:31:34.087 --> 02:31:41.751]  More aid going, more to give them intelligence, to kill innocent Houthis and Yemenis.
[02:31:42.111 --> 02:31:49.835]  The worst humanitarian crisis on earth, but that doesn't make the front page of the toilet paper record, the New York Times.
[02:31:50.355 --> 02:32:04.473]   It never made the front page of the toilet paper record, the New York Times, ABC, NBC, CBS, FU, you know what, when they were murdering civilians all over Iraq.
[02:32:04.634 --> 02:32:06.875]  Oh, shock and awe.
[02:32:07.456 --> 02:32:09.037]  Shock and awe was fine.
[02:32:09.677 --> 02:32:10.238]  Yeah.
[02:32:11.178 --> 02:32:12.079]  Anthony Blinken.
[02:32:12.619 --> 02:32:12.920]  Look at him.
[02:32:14.221 --> 02:32:14.561]  Look at him.
[02:32:16.002 --> 02:32:17.623]  This guy telling us what to do?
[02:32:20.826 --> 02:32:22.587]  We got sick people in charge.
[02:32:22.907 --> 02:32:25.149]  Do everything you can to support InfoWar.
[02:32:25.509 --> 02:32:27.270]  Our future is on the line.
[02:32:28.992 --> 02:32:31.513]  You saw what happened with the COVID war.
[02:32:31.754 --> 02:32:33.415]  They sucked the joy out of life.
[02:32:34.327 --> 02:32:35.608]  Sucked the joy out of life.
[02:32:37.369 --> 02:32:43.333]  Killed millions and millions and millions of lives and livelihoods.
[02:32:44.213 --> 02:32:47.415]  Way more, way more than COVID killed.
[02:32:47.575 --> 02:32:48.536]  And who's COVID killing?
[02:32:48.936 --> 02:32:49.917]  Only the old people.
[02:32:50.277 --> 02:32:52.178]  People with pre-existing comorbidities.
[02:32:52.718 --> 02:32:54.980]  Not a word about getting healthy and getting strong.
[02:32:55.280 --> 02:33:00.463]  And by the way, a number of those products that you have in InfoWars will get you healthy and get strong.
[02:33:01.317 --> 02:33:07.880]  You better get strong as you can, spiritually, emotionally, and physically, and they got great products that are going to help you do that.
[02:33:09.141 --> 02:33:13.162]  The bodies, the survival shield, the winter sun.
[02:33:14.223 --> 02:33:17.284]  Now, one after another, they got terrific products.
[02:33:18.185 --> 02:33:22.206]  BrainForce, and boy, you need BrainForce because we're brain dead.
[02:33:23.187 --> 02:33:25.508]  So, we're at a crucial time right now.
[02:33:27.569 --> 02:33:30.151]  We have to unite for peace or we're going to die for war.
[02:33:30.491 --> 02:33:33.213]  We have to get a universal peace movement going.
[02:33:34.354 --> 02:33:35.414]  We have to connect.
[02:33:36.075 --> 02:33:36.775]  We have to connect.
[02:33:36.815 --> 02:33:38.477]  We all must connect for peace.
[02:33:39.437 --> 02:33:44.280]  Because we're listening to pieces of crap, sick pieces of junk.
[02:33:44.881 --> 02:33:52.086]  Little Lindsey Graham, not a war that that little freak didn't, not a war that that little freak didn't love.
[02:33:54.167 --> 02:33:56.168]  I remember when Fox News used to have me on.
[02:33:56.188 --> 02:33:59.090]  They used to bring up those trucks in the old days.
[02:33:59.150 --> 02:34:01.471]  They ate the satellite and bring it back down.
[02:34:02.512 --> 02:34:06.914]  And I'm doing interviews, and they're breaking up the interview because Lindsey Graham's coming on.
[02:34:06.934 --> 02:34:10.216]  Who would listen to this stupid freak?
[02:34:11.136 --> 02:34:11.877]  I'll tell you who.
[02:34:12.437 --> 02:34:13.818]  Stupid freaks!
[02:34:16.459 --> 02:34:19.000]  And that's the majority of the people.
[02:34:19.661 --> 02:34:21.702]  But it does not take a majority to prevail.
[02:34:22.722 --> 02:34:35.949]  Only an irate, tireless minority, keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men, says Samuel Adams, and the Infowarriors are that irate, tireless minority.
[02:34:36.990 --> 02:34:43.313]  And we can set those brushfires of freedom in the hearts and minds of men and women of the world.
[02:34:44.234 --> 02:34:45.695]  We must unite for peace.
[02:34:47.330 --> 02:34:50.833]  And you have to support InfoWars and anything.
[02:34:50.913 --> 02:34:54.056]  And again, we're putting out a magazine like nothing else at Trends Journal.
[02:34:54.336 --> 02:34:55.997]  Last week was 185 pages.
[02:34:56.338 --> 02:34:59.000]  We tell you what's going on, what it means, what's next and what to do.
[02:34:59.460 --> 02:35:01.162]  And when we come back, we're going to tell you what to do.
[02:35:01.302 --> 02:35:01.842]  The markets?
[02:35:02.283 --> 02:35:03.484]  Not doing so good today.
[02:35:03.884 --> 02:35:04.705]  Wonder why?
[02:35:05.005 --> 02:35:05.865]  I'll tell you why.
[02:35:06.166 --> 02:35:08.748]  Because crap shooting out of Powell's mouth.
[02:35:09.188 --> 02:35:10.369]  Oh yeah, the Fed hack.
[02:35:10.810 --> 02:35:11.951]  Yeah, we'll be right back.
[02:35:12.471 --> 02:35:13.592]  InfoWars, support them.
[02:35:14.981 --> 02:35:20.285]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show and this is very serious what's going on.
[02:35:20.325 --> 02:35:25.029]  They keep trying to shut down Alex Jones and they haven't been successful.
[02:35:25.049 --> 02:35:26.550]  Is this where this guy's fighting?
[02:35:27.130 --> 02:35:27.731]  My God.
[02:35:27.751 --> 02:35:30.052]  I mean, how many people would crumble?
[02:35:30.933 --> 02:35:31.894]  You know, I understand.
[02:35:31.934 --> 02:35:33.295]  I haven't gone through what he went through.
[02:35:33.315 --> 02:35:34.476]  You know, there's a movie out there.
[02:35:34.496 --> 02:35:36.077]  It's called What Zizzi Gave Honey Boy.
[02:35:36.852 --> 02:35:38.753]  It's my book, What Zizzy Gave Honey Boy.
[02:35:38.793 --> 02:35:41.395]  Zizzy's a Neapolitan dialect for auntie.
[02:35:41.935 --> 02:35:50.921]  And I, you know, part of the thing is like how I got blackballed out of media when I said America would lose the Afghan war and the Iraq wars.
[02:35:51.701 --> 02:35:52.602]  Nobody wanted to hear it.
[02:35:53.543 --> 02:35:55.344]  And I had some tough times.
[02:35:56.304 --> 02:35:59.386]  I mean, I know what it is, but Alex is going through all these lawsuits.
[02:36:00.387 --> 02:36:05.230]  I mean, you know, we got to, whatever you could afford, even donate money if you can't buy anything.
[02:36:06.818 --> 02:36:09.962]  And he said it also, they're made in USA products.
[02:36:11.243 --> 02:36:19.152]  Again, I was talking about that low life, piece of garbage, scum, murderous crap, Bill Clinton.
[02:36:21.996 --> 02:36:25.320]  That's the guy that got us NAFTA along with Al Gore.
[02:36:27.828 --> 02:36:31.289]  We don't need your dirty manufacturing jobs in America.
[02:36:31.849 --> 02:36:36.131]  You can get a job as, you know, something called Amazon coming in.
[02:36:36.571 --> 02:36:40.612]  You can make $62.50 a week in a hernia after you pay taxes and everything.
[02:36:40.993 --> 02:36:42.813]  You don't have to have a middle class life anymore.
[02:36:42.833 --> 02:36:46.254]  We're going to send all our jobs to Mexico.
[02:36:47.395 --> 02:36:48.915]  And then he brought them to China.
[02:36:50.816 --> 02:37:08.930]   What Alex said about Made in America And by the way, this is going to turn Russia into a self-sustaining economy rather than buying into globalism.
[02:37:10.151 --> 02:37:14.474]  You know, again, last night, you know, yesterday when I have a sister in a nursing home, I go down to see her.
[02:37:16.135 --> 02:37:21.158]  And I'm driving back, you know, driving back on a Sunday and there's Amazon trucks.
[02:37:21.638 --> 02:37:23.840]  I never saw an Amazon truck three years ago.
[02:37:25.120 --> 02:37:27.422]  Poor people working on a Sunday delivering crap.
[02:37:30.902 --> 02:37:31.923]  They sold us out.
[02:37:32.663 --> 02:37:38.066]  Every time I go into like a Home Depot, my heart breaks because the people working in these places are going to go nowhere.
[02:37:38.366 --> 02:37:39.106]  They have no future.
[02:37:42.148 --> 02:37:46.370]  Russia is going to be pulling out of globalism because of all the sanctions.
[02:37:47.170 --> 02:37:49.751]  They have all the human and natural resources they need.
[02:37:51.212 --> 02:37:53.153]  They don't have to have it made in China.
[02:37:55.334 --> 02:37:57.695]  At one time, you used to buy China that was made in China.
[02:37:57.755 --> 02:37:58.516]  It was really nice.
[02:38:00.345 --> 02:38:01.725]  And now you're buying, oh, Vietnam?
[02:38:01.745 --> 02:38:02.625]  The Vietnam War?
[02:38:03.026 --> 02:38:03.586]  When I grew up?
[02:38:04.146 --> 02:38:04.326]  Yep.
[02:38:05.866 --> 02:38:07.206]  Every day I'd wake up, are they gonna get me?
[02:38:07.226 --> 02:38:07.787]  Are they gonna get me?
[02:38:07.807 --> 02:38:09.027]  Because I had to draft back then.
[02:38:09.427 --> 02:38:11.387]  And by the way, I think we should bring back the draft.
[02:38:11.707 --> 02:38:12.728]  Because then they'll end the wars.
[02:38:13.088 --> 02:38:15.428]  That's the only reason my generation fought against the war.
[02:38:15.608 --> 02:38:16.948]  Because everybody was getting drafted.
[02:38:20.509 --> 02:38:23.270]  So Russia could become a self-sustaining economy.
[02:38:25.550 --> 02:38:27.131]  You don't need globalization.
[02:38:27.211 --> 02:38:29.371]  America could be a self-sustaining economy.
[02:38:29.989 --> 02:38:32.330]  We have all the human and natural resources we need.
[02:38:32.930 --> 02:38:38.032]  But again, as I look at the people now and see how low they've gone, I don't know if we have those human resources anymore.
[02:38:40.292 --> 02:38:56.538]  As I said, they should have had forbidden Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, McDonald's, and Burger King, and all the others, Kentucky Fried Chicken, from pulling out of Russia.
[02:38:56.758 --> 02:38:57.758]  They should have forbidden it.
[02:38:58.553 --> 02:39:02.215]  They should have let the people keep eating that crap so they'd be too fat to fight.
[02:39:03.275 --> 02:39:04.055]  Look at America.
[02:39:04.075 --> 02:39:08.137]  42% of the people obese.
[02:39:08.297 --> 02:39:09.097]  70% overweight.
[02:39:09.838 --> 02:39:10.458]  What fight?
[02:39:11.538 --> 02:39:13.779]  We need to become a self-sustaining economy.
[02:39:15.460 --> 02:39:18.561]  Now, going back to the sanctions.
[02:39:18.901 --> 02:39:20.422]  The sanctions are hurting the people.
[02:39:21.482 --> 02:39:28.165]  And I do a podcast each week with Judge Andrew Napolitano, who's also, you know, used to be on Fox, he's on with Alex from time to time.
[02:39:29.953 --> 02:39:34.437]  And if you go to the Gerald Cilenti channel, you'll see the one last week.
[02:39:34.777 --> 02:39:36.938]  The sanctions are against the Constitution.
[02:39:38.379 --> 02:39:40.301]  But we have no Constitution anymore.
[02:39:41.302 --> 02:39:42.523]  We have no Bill of Rights.
[02:39:43.623 --> 02:39:45.285]  Hey, I'm little Andy!
[02:39:45.665 --> 02:39:47.386]  Fill you up Cuomo!
[02:39:48.307 --> 02:39:51.029]  I'll tell you who's essential and who's not essential.
[02:39:51.049 --> 02:39:54.572]  Yep.
[02:39:55.652 --> 02:39:58.374]  Russian sanctions threaten Commonwealth supply chain.
[02:39:58.394 --> 02:39:58.915]  You got it.
[02:40:02.335 --> 02:40:03.216]  This is stupid.
[02:40:03.776 --> 02:40:13.262]  You got stupid freaks like little Andy Cuomo, arrogant Goosome Newsome, one little clown after another telling us what to do.
[02:40:15.463 --> 02:40:18.485]  Most of these people, by the way, never had a real job in their life.
[02:40:21.346 --> 02:40:23.868]  They get into the political system and that's where they suck off.
[02:40:24.208 --> 02:40:25.969]  The same thing with, again, I was up there.
[02:40:26.389 --> 02:40:28.851]  You know, I was the assistant to the Secretary of the New York State Senate.
[02:40:30.126 --> 02:40:39.754]  Bureaucrats are the dumbest people around that can't get a job in the real world, that suck into the political system and then tell you what to do.
[02:40:40.014 --> 02:40:41.075]  All right, look at the clowns.
[02:40:41.596 --> 02:40:42.497]  Look at the jerks.
[02:40:42.837 --> 02:40:45.639]  Look at the arrogant little pieces of scum.
[02:40:46.180 --> 02:40:49.402]  Murderous, murderous jerks telling us what to do.
[02:40:50.103 --> 02:40:51.384]  Yep, the foundation.
[02:40:51.624 --> 02:40:53.826]  Yeah, the foundation for selling crap.
[02:40:54.126 --> 02:40:55.387]  Is that what's on top of it?
[02:40:56.809 --> 02:40:57.149]  Look at it!
[02:40:57.930 --> 02:41:06.156]  Little Georgie Bush, again, a daddy's boy, like little Andy Cuomo, like True Dope, you got up there in Canada, a little actor.
[02:41:07.557 --> 02:41:15.363]  Going back today, that gas is again, Brent Cruz, about $115 a barrel.
[02:41:17.345 --> 02:41:19.166]  This is going to destroy the economy.
[02:41:20.467 --> 02:41:21.868]  They're destroying the world.
[02:41:21.888 --> 02:41:25.351]  And they're going to take more and more of our rights away from us.
[02:41:26.383 --> 02:41:28.184]  Who's buying up all the homes?
[02:41:28.625 --> 02:41:33.449]  Only about 30% of them from the big hedge funds and private equity groups.
[02:41:33.889 --> 02:41:35.250]  People can't afford to buy them.
[02:41:35.550 --> 02:41:38.753]  So they buy them up and then they rent them back because people can't afford to.
[02:41:39.313 --> 02:41:53.625]  The rents in New York City are through the roof for real estate, but for rentals or apartment rentals and condos, but not for commercial real estate because people aren't going back to work.
[02:41:54.651 --> 02:41:56.332]  And they're not going to go back for a while.
[02:41:56.352 --> 02:42:02.834]  And that's destroying all the small businesses as the bigs get bigger and we get smaller.
[02:42:03.414 --> 02:42:07.395]  Gold, guns, and a getaway plan.
[02:42:09.316 --> 02:42:11.456]  Guns, gold, and a getaway plan.
[02:42:11.476 --> 02:42:12.837]  GC's, 3G's.
[02:42:13.597 --> 02:42:21.960]  Again, and Infowars has the products you need to be taking care of yourself.
[02:42:22.060 --> 02:42:23.000]  Survivalism.
[02:42:23.613 --> 02:42:34.142]  By the way, every week we have a survivalism article in the Trends Journal by Bradley Steiner, one of the top close combat guys in the country, passed away recently.
[02:42:34.482 --> 02:42:36.464]  My teacher, John Perkins, was his teacher.
[02:42:37.405 --> 02:42:39.627]  But you better prepare.
[02:42:40.888 --> 02:42:47.013]  And InfoWars has a lot of the products that you could use, because this thing's going to come down big and hard.
[02:42:48.454 --> 02:42:50.575]   Today, Powell crap.
[02:42:50.595 --> 02:42:51.096]  There we go.
[02:42:51.516 --> 02:42:52.976]  Great, great, great, great products.
[02:42:53.577 --> 02:42:54.257]  Great products.
[02:42:54.757 --> 02:42:55.718]  Ultimate Acryl Oil.
[02:42:57.078 --> 02:42:57.498]  Bioshield.
[02:42:57.639 --> 02:42:58.219]  Bodies.
[02:42:58.259 --> 02:42:59.599]  You got to get that bodies.
[02:42:59.739 --> 02:43:00.740]  Survival Shield.
[02:43:02.241 --> 02:43:03.461]  These are the stuff you need.
[02:43:04.442 --> 02:43:06.863]  And things are going to get bad and they're only going to get worse.
[02:43:08.884 --> 02:43:18.828]  So, as we're looking at what's going on today, Jerome Powell, Jerome Powell, is either he's a liar or stupid.
[02:43:19.835 --> 02:43:29.979]  Two years ago, the crap spewing out of his mouth over a year ago, excuse me, not two, a year, over a year ago, that inflation was temporary.
[02:43:31.200 --> 02:43:33.321]  And then it became transitory.
[02:43:35.482 --> 02:43:36.942]  And now, well, it's pretty bad.
[02:43:36.982 --> 02:43:37.522]  Yeah, what is it?
[02:43:37.622 --> 02:43:38.743]  Transgendatory?
[02:43:38.763 --> 02:43:48.387]  You're going to rate this quarter percent interest rate, the 25% interest rate meant nothing, nothing, nothing.
[02:43:49.258 --> 02:43:51.279]  Not with inflation of 40-year highs.
[02:43:52.560 --> 02:43:59.365]  Again, I don't tell people what to do, but for me, it's guns, gold, and a getaway plan.
[02:44:00.105 --> 02:44:02.547]  They could lock down the banks like that.
[02:44:02.567 --> 02:44:10.152]  They're going to go all digital at some point, so they know every penny that you spent, where you spent it, what you spent it on, so they could get it from you.
[02:44:10.472 --> 02:44:12.954]  Because these politicians never work a day in their life.
[02:44:13.254 --> 02:44:16.676]  Did they take paid cuts when the COVID war came out?
[02:44:17.076 --> 02:44:17.937]  No way, no how.
[02:44:18.812 --> 02:44:23.534]  So they want all the money they can get from us and they're going to get it from us if we don't stop it.
[02:44:24.574 --> 02:44:28.936]  Again, why would you keep your money in the bank when they're not paying you any interest?
[02:44:30.596 --> 02:44:31.817]  Put it someplace safe.
[02:44:32.697 --> 02:44:36.959]  Make sure you get your hands on it because things are going to change like that.
[02:44:37.319 --> 02:44:38.559]  We're going to be back in a few.
[02:44:38.639 --> 02:44:40.200]  Remember, support InfoWars.
[02:44:41.800 --> 02:44:42.501]  Hello, hello.
[02:44:42.901 --> 02:44:44.661]  Great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:44:45.542 --> 02:44:46.262]  What do we got here?
[02:44:50.586 --> 02:44:50.986]  Gold?
[02:44:51.006 --> 02:44:54.289]  It's up to $19.40 an ounce.
[02:44:55.630 --> 02:44:56.230]  The markets?
[02:44:57.231 --> 02:44:59.853]  Down.
[02:44:59.873 --> 02:45:00.974]  327 points.
[02:45:03.216 --> 02:45:06.938]  That's after Powell shot off his mouth that they're going to have to raise interest rates.
[02:45:08.680 --> 02:45:22.091]   Even if they raise interest rates, when you have inflation running at 40-year highs, raising them 25 basis points, 50 basis points, a full basis point too, Not going to make any difference.
[02:45:24.472 --> 02:45:25.572]  It's still cheap money.
[02:45:25.652 --> 02:45:28.453]  When you put inflation into it, you still have negative interest rates.
[02:45:30.794 --> 02:45:32.014]  Inflation is with us.
[02:45:33.415 --> 02:45:34.435]  This is just the beginning.
[02:45:35.836 --> 02:45:37.657]  So again, I don't give financial advice.
[02:45:39.777 --> 02:45:46.140]  But speaking only for myself, gold to me is the number one.
[02:45:47.210 --> 02:45:48.571]  And you buy it and you put it away.
[02:45:48.611 --> 02:45:49.672]  I don't play the markets.
[02:45:49.712 --> 02:45:53.676]  I began playing the markets when I left, when I used to work in D.C.
[02:45:55.097 --> 02:45:59.221]  I was a Chief Government Affairs Specialist for the chemical industry back in the 70s.
[02:46:00.062 --> 02:46:06.308]  As a young man, not knowing, not very smart, I was killing environmental legislation at the height of the environmental movement.
[02:46:08.430 --> 02:46:10.132]  28 years old, I was staying at the Willard Hotel.
[02:46:10.152 --> 02:46:11.733]  That's where Trump has all those things.
[02:46:11.753 --> 02:46:15.195]  You know, he brings people into that, besides his place.
[02:46:15.275 --> 02:46:17.497]  It's like one of the beautiful old hotels.
[02:46:17.837 --> 02:46:19.838]  And I'm putting my meetings on at the Hay-Adams.
[02:46:21.640 --> 02:46:37.551]  And then the Iranian conflict began and people had no idea of the Shah, how he was brought in after the United States, the CIA and the MI6 of England overthrew the democratically elected government of Mosaddegh.
[02:46:38.590 --> 02:46:49.317]  Because he had the nerve to nationalize the oil and take it out of the hands of Standard Oil, better known today as ExxonMobil, and Anglo-Iranian oil, better known today as BP.
[02:46:50.298 --> 02:46:51.999]  So I knew the revolution was real.
[02:46:52.880 --> 02:47:03.467]  And by the way, the reason it became radicalized is because the American government, under Jimmy Peanut Brain Peanut Pharma, another low-life piece of scum crap, oh, you like Al-Qaeda?
[02:47:03.707 --> 02:47:07.650]  That's the guy that gave us the Mujahideen.
[02:47:08.869 --> 02:47:10.170]  Oh, with Brzezinski?
[02:47:10.370 --> 02:47:16.773]  Oh yeah, you know the one on MSNBC, the daughter of your father, and the son that's now an ambassador, yeah, that Brzezinski?
[02:47:17.113 --> 02:47:18.674]  Yeah, they're the ones that created it.
[02:47:18.694 --> 02:47:23.216]  So these are the people in charge.
[02:47:24.197 --> 02:47:29.239]  So going back, as we learn to hate Iran, I'm saying to myself, what's going to happen?
[02:47:30.680 --> 02:47:33.941]  Just like what's going on in Russia, as people hate Russia, I said, what's going to happen?
[02:47:33.961 --> 02:47:37.023]  And I started playing Gold and Oil futures.
[02:47:39.991 --> 02:47:44.292]  I was like 32 years old.
[02:47:44.712 --> 02:47:48.354]  And a $5,000 bet, I parlayed into almost three quarters of a million.
[02:47:50.734 --> 02:47:52.735]  And that's when I became a political atheist.
[02:47:54.335 --> 02:47:59.057]  Hadn't been in Washington, did the trip I couldn't, wouldn't know what I know if I wasn't on the other side.
[02:48:00.037 --> 02:48:01.038]  And I quit my job.
[02:48:01.458 --> 02:48:03.258]  I lost most of that dough, by the way.
[02:48:03.698 --> 02:48:05.479]  I kept gambling away in the markets.
[02:48:06.309 --> 02:48:23.836]  So what I do now is I've been doing my first buy of gold was $187.50 an ounce, but put it away, put it away, put it away in a safe place away from me here, not in the bank, but in a safe place where you could store gold and other.
[02:48:23.856 --> 02:48:28.058]  And that's what I suggest people consider doing.
[02:48:28.138 --> 02:48:29.638]  I do not give financial advice.
[02:48:30.759 --> 02:48:35.661]  We are going to go through the toughest economic times we've ever been through in our lives.
[02:48:37.210 --> 02:48:39.171]  It's unfolding in front of our faces.
[02:48:40.591 --> 02:48:44.612]  You know what I say, when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[02:48:45.693 --> 02:48:50.774]  I said this when the COVID war broke out, that crime rates were going to skyrocket, and they did.
[02:48:55.115 --> 02:49:21.348]   When economies start going down, you're going to see, before this happened in 2019, You had protests and riots going on in Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, Lebanon, South Africa, Algeria, France, India, one country after another, people taking to the streets in protest of living in poverty, government corruption, crime, violence.
[02:49:21.368 --> 02:49:24.750]  That was before this happened.
[02:49:25.638 --> 02:49:32.380]  And now the COVID wars destroyed the lives and livelihoods on a global scale in the hundreds of millions.
[02:49:36.161 --> 02:49:46.204]  One of the headlines right now in the cartoon news network, CNN, resistance in Ukraine.
[02:49:48.605 --> 02:49:52.646]  Resistance in Ukraine digs in and Russians attack.
[02:49:57.153 --> 02:49:58.514]  To me, it's criminal.
[02:49:59.115 --> 02:50:00.596]  What are you digging in for?
[02:50:01.116 --> 02:50:03.658]  Russia could wipe the place off the map like that.
[02:50:06.461 --> 02:50:06.981]  Like that.
[02:50:09.563 --> 02:50:10.484]  Why are you digging in?
[02:50:11.705 --> 02:50:13.226]  Negotiate for peace.
[02:50:14.668 --> 02:50:16.029]  You're not going to beat them.
[02:50:17.210 --> 02:50:20.933]  Again, it's not like I don't know what I'm talking about.
[02:50:21.693 --> 02:50:49.413]   We only began writing about What was going on in Ukraine, back in the Trends Journal in 2014, when the United States under Victoria Nuland, who's back again as an undersecretary, under the table, undersecretary, along with John McCain, John and Saint McCain,
[02:50:51.730 --> 02:51:00.417]  Helped launch the coup against Viktor Yanukovych, the democratically elected president of Ukraine.
[02:51:03.199 --> 02:51:04.240]  And why it happened?
[02:51:05.661 --> 02:51:09.044]  Well, the why was because Ukraine's been in the toilet for a long time.
[02:51:09.084 --> 02:51:09.884]  They needed dough.
[02:51:10.485 --> 02:51:16.629]  They went to the European Union and IMF, the International Mafia Monetary Fund, and they were going to make a deal.
[02:51:16.690 --> 02:51:19.652]  Putin gave them a better deal and they overthrew the government, the United States.
[02:51:20.879 --> 02:51:22.740]  So we've been following this since the beginning.
[02:51:24.040 --> 02:51:36.185]  We've been following, and again, quoting in our Trends Journal, how James Baker, under George Bush Sr., told Gorbachev that NATO would not move one inch further.
[02:51:36.205 --> 02:51:39.307]  There were 16 NATO countries then, today there were 30.
[02:51:41.027 --> 02:51:46.349]  We write about how there were military operations, naval operations, off the coast of St.
[02:51:46.409 --> 02:51:47.570]  Petersburg with NATO.
[02:51:48.826 --> 02:52:02.449]  We wrote about how in January, US fighter bombers flying 14.1 miles off the coast of Russia, how they provoked this.
[02:52:03.830 --> 02:52:06.470]  All right, you poke the bear and now you got it.
[02:52:08.351 --> 02:52:14.372]  Rather than sending more military armaments like Biden bragging, we're going to keep sending more and sending more.
[02:52:14.972 --> 02:52:17.493]  All you're doing is needlessly killing more people.
[02:52:18.331 --> 02:52:20.933]  And destroying the country.
[02:52:22.295 --> 02:52:28.360]  But Biden's been probably very good at that because I don't think there's a war that he never didn't like.
[02:52:30.362 --> 02:52:33.605]  Oh, he loved that Yugoslav war that nobody talks about.
[02:52:34.786 --> 02:52:36.047]  Oh, that was in Europe too.
[02:52:36.628 --> 02:52:37.148]  Oh yeah.
[02:52:39.050 --> 02:52:40.271]  How about the Iraq war?
[02:52:41.472 --> 02:52:41.953]  There he is.
[02:52:41.993 --> 02:52:42.914]  That's that quote of him.
[02:52:44.797 --> 02:52:46.739]  They killed bombs away, killed people.
[02:52:46.759 --> 02:52:47.019]  Look at that.
[02:52:47.459 --> 02:52:48.980]  Oh, and the fake hair he got.
[02:52:49.501 --> 02:52:51.982]  How can a guy get fake hair, get hair implants?
[02:52:52.343 --> 02:52:55.124]  That shows you what a little gutless guy the guy is.
[02:52:55.865 --> 02:52:57.366]  Yeah, and bleached blonde.
[02:52:58.607 --> 02:53:00.008]  I think I'll make my hair black.
[02:53:00.388 --> 02:53:01.029]  I'm getting old.
[02:53:01.129 --> 02:53:03.410]  I think I'm losing hair up here.
[02:53:03.951 --> 02:53:06.112]  Oh, Biden, where'd you get your hair transplant?
[02:53:07.673 --> 02:53:08.634]  Hair transplant?
[02:53:08.654 --> 02:53:09.374]  Grow the hell up.
[02:53:10.475 --> 02:53:11.376]  Hair transplant.
[02:53:12.006 --> 02:53:14.328]  Biden's belligerent militarism revisited.
[02:53:14.428 --> 02:53:14.668]  Yep.
[02:53:17.169 --> 02:53:18.010]  We need peace.
[02:53:20.051 --> 02:53:23.773]  We must get together and unite for peace or we're going to die in war.
[02:53:25.094 --> 02:53:27.115]  World War II is in ancient history.
[02:53:28.036 --> 02:53:31.278]  Berlin was grander than Paris before it was bombed out.
[02:53:33.880 --> 02:53:39.063]  But going back to you and yours, you better prepare.
[02:53:40.549 --> 02:53:41.609]  Prepare for the worst.
[02:53:41.689 --> 02:53:47.231]  If the worst doesn't happen and you're prepared, you lose nothing.
[02:53:48.251 --> 02:53:52.733]  If the worst happens and you're not prepared, you lose everything.
[02:53:53.373 --> 02:54:03.796]  And InfoWars has a lot of those products that you need to prepare and prevail and prosper, as we do with the Trends Journal.
[02:54:04.637 --> 02:54:05.737]  So support us both.
[02:54:06.797 --> 02:54:08.778]  We're warriors for the Prince of Peace.
[02:54:10.228 --> 02:54:21.374]  We're calling for peace as the arrogant little boys, the Graham's of nothing, a Graham cracker calls for murder and more war.
[02:54:23.315 --> 02:54:24.276]  And we'll get banned.
[02:54:25.356 --> 02:54:27.037]  That will be the next big ban.
[02:54:28.138 --> 02:54:33.381]  They will ban all us people who are warriors for the Prince of Peace.
[02:54:34.601 --> 02:54:43.395]   How dare How dare you drive the money changers out of the temple?
[02:54:44.776 --> 02:54:47.879]  Don't do anything bad to the Goldman Sachs gang and the Merrill Lynch mob.
[02:54:48.779 --> 02:54:49.900]  You'd be hanging on a cross.
[02:54:50.961 --> 02:54:53.222]  Support InfoWars, support the Trends Journal.
[02:54:53.442 --> 02:54:54.383]  We'll see you next week.
[02:54:55.583 --> 02:54:57.583]  Thank you for tuning in.
[02:54:57.583 --> 02:55:04.583]  [Music]
[02:55:04.583 --> 02:55:09.583]  Every product and service that I bring listeners...
[02:55:09.679 --> 02:55:19.728]  is a product and service that I use, that I believe in, that has great customer service and great results, because I am not fly-by-night.
[02:55:20.068 --> 02:55:24.933]  I'm not a globalist that wants to rip you off, and then launch a new scam and rip you off again.
[02:55:25.313 --> 02:55:31.779]  And so over the years, we had a lot of great sponsors, but they got threatened, they got harassed, they got bullied, and so they went away.
[02:55:32.019 --> 02:55:41.967]   So in the last decade, I went to selling products directly To the listeners that we can buy, and produce, and make, and certify, and know we're great.
[02:55:42.207 --> 02:55:53.596]  But, because of supply chain breakdowns, and because of the increased cost of materials, everything else, that model now has been failing, and InfoWars hasn't had the funds to operate.
[02:55:54.197 --> 02:55:56.919]  And we've gotten into the Red Summit, and that's been a crisis.
[02:55:57.499 --> 02:56:02.143]  But then about a month ago, I locked myself in my office for eight hours.
[02:56:04.102 --> 02:56:05.724]  And I didn't distract myself.
[02:56:05.784 --> 02:56:06.925]  I turned off the computers.
[02:56:06.985 --> 02:56:07.926]  I turned off the phone.
[02:56:08.046 --> 02:56:12.770]  I wouldn't let myself have anything but my coffee maker and some bottled water.
[02:56:13.951 --> 02:56:19.056]  And I just wrote down notes of what do I use?
[02:56:19.256 --> 02:56:22.719]  What is a great product that will be a sponsor and isn't afraid?
[02:56:24.040 --> 02:56:27.984]  And I came up with just a few ideas, and they were all great ideas, but just a few ideas.
[02:56:28.044 --> 02:56:55.764]   But the number one idea Well, something I've experienced, that my family's experienced, my listeners have experienced, we've had some of these sponsors in the past, of the groups out there that help people do tax preparation, groups that help give people tax advice, people that actually let the public know about the loopholes that the establishment and the elite use, but that the IRS bureaucrats don't want the people to know.
[02:56:56.485 --> 02:57:05.690]  So I thought, who was that group that was highly rated that I used years ago and that some of my family used and that was actually a sponsor many years ago on some of the radio stations I was on?
[02:57:06.130 --> 02:57:08.572]  I was like, it's American Tax Solution.
[02:57:08.852 --> 02:57:10.233]  So I went and looked them up and I'm like, wow!
[02:57:11.188 --> 02:57:16.067]   highest rating, better business bureau. I've used them, families used them before. Why
[02:57:16.067 --> 02:57:20.947]   didn't I think of this? They've got all these dozens of great services at very, very low
[02:57:20.947 --> 02:57:26.308]   prices. I mean, in fact, when they come in and help you with the IRS, negotiate on average
[02:57:26.308 --> 02:57:36.387]   $10,000 down to $1,000, $100,000 down to $10,000. They just get part of that savings for themselves
[02:57:36.387 --> 02:57:37.587]  and that's how they fund themselves.
[02:57:37.562 --> 02:57:40.864]  So, you're not out any money, you're just getting the savings.
[02:57:41.384 --> 02:57:48.629]  And so, I reached out to them, and immediately they said, Alex Jones, let me call my manager.
[02:57:48.849 --> 02:57:50.230]  The next day, the owner calls.

[02:59:39.292 --> 02:59:43.213]  More isn't going to come in for a long time, so I took it back to full price.
[02:59:43.233 --> 02:59:44.493]  And I was just thinking, you know what?
