[00:15.000 --> 00:17.920]  Info wars tomorrow's news today
[00:17.920 --> 00:36.920]  Ladies and Gentlemen, it is broadcasts like the one that I have planned for you here today
[00:36.920 --> 00:42.920]  that are why they call info wars next year's news today
[00:42.920 --> 00:48.920]  but you may have noticed
[00:48.920 --> 00:55.920]  we're now at that point where everything info wars has talked about
[00:55.920 --> 01:01.920]  everything info wars has been warning about is right in front of your face
[01:01.920 --> 01:08.920]  or like your mirror on your car says objects might be closer than they appear
[01:08.920 --> 01:12.920]  we're right up in it now
[01:12.920 --> 01:18.920]  and I did a deep dive trying to connect dots last night on the Trump raid
[01:18.920 --> 01:23.920]  the FBI response, the IRS hiring story
[01:23.920 --> 01:27.920]  with the umbrella of the understanding of where the democrat party is at
[01:27.920 --> 01:30.920]  where they want to take the country
[01:30.920 --> 01:35.920]  and applying things from the past that they've said and done
[01:35.920 --> 01:40.920]  to the now certain future we face if they are not stopped
[01:40.920 --> 01:45.920]  so I want to start the show with this and we'll bring it back in the next hour
[01:45.920 --> 01:50.920]  when I really lay this out and it's going to be a very deep dive
[01:50.920 --> 01:56.920]  somewhat complex but I think you're going to understand the story when it's all said and done
[01:56.920 --> 01:58.920]  this was Barack Obama
[01:58.920 --> 02:04.920]  now I want you to just listen to this clip of Barack Obama from 2008
[02:04.920 --> 02:08.920]  just listen to it, I'm not going to give it any context
[02:08.920 --> 02:12.920]  I want you to listen to it and I want to see, let's do a little psychological experiment
[02:12.920 --> 02:15.920]  what comes to your mind
[02:15.920 --> 02:19.920]  what might be happening today
[02:19.920 --> 02:26.920]  that makes this clip from Barack Obama in 2018 so relevant and so scary
[02:26.920 --> 02:32.920]  here's Barack Obama just before he was elected in 2008 on the campaign trail
[02:32.920 --> 02:34.920]  he said this
[02:34.920 --> 02:38.920]  we cannot continue to rely only on our military
[02:38.920 --> 02:42.920]  in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set
[02:42.920 --> 02:45.920]  we've got to have a civilian national security force
[02:45.920 --> 02:51.920]  that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded
[02:51.920 --> 02:56.920]  and now the IRS hires 87,000 new agents
[02:56.920 --> 02:59.920]  that need to be trained to use deadly force
[02:59.920 --> 03:07.920]  that are being trained to invade houses and do raids and shoot and kill people
[03:07.920 --> 03:09.920]  all being hired by the democrat party
[03:09.920 --> 03:15.920]  all being hired as the patriot purge is happening in all institutions of government
[03:15.920 --> 03:18.920]  I think it's pretty obvious what's happening folks isn't it
[03:18.920 --> 03:22.920]  the democrats are literally building an army
[03:22.920 --> 03:25.920]  see the military can't go into your house
[03:25.920 --> 03:30.920]  but the IRS can
[03:30.920 --> 03:34.920]  now with Venmo and Cash App and crypto and all this other stuff
[03:34.920 --> 03:38.920]  you don't think that they've got ways to say you're laundering money
[03:38.920 --> 03:40.920]  or to say you're not paying taxes
[03:40.920 --> 03:42.920]  oh yeah they do
[03:42.920 --> 03:44.920]  and now they got the army to do it
[03:44.920 --> 03:46.920]  and they're training them
[03:46.920 --> 03:49.920]  and if you don't think for one second
[03:49.920 --> 03:53.920]  they're doing this now because of the democrat totalitarian control
[03:53.920 --> 03:55.920]  and the patriot purge
[03:55.920 --> 03:57.920]  you're out of your mind
[03:57.920 --> 04:02.920]  but so how does that connect to the raid at Mar-a-Lago
[04:02.920 --> 04:08.920]  and the establishment regime media response since
[04:08.920 --> 04:12.920]  folks I can tell you right now what they're doing
[04:12.920 --> 04:18.920]  and I think the hiring of the IRS agents is just their next phase of the plan
[04:18.920 --> 04:23.920]  but right now what they are doing is they are
[04:23.920 --> 04:28.920]  putting together lists of people who have spoken out against the FBI
[04:28.920 --> 04:33.920]  putting together lists of people who have made public statements on the internet
[04:33.920 --> 04:35.920]  or just spoken word
[04:35.920 --> 04:39.920]  anything that they might deem as violent
[04:39.920 --> 04:41.920]  now it might not even be you calling for violence
[04:41.920 --> 04:43.920]  it might just be you saying the FBI is corrupt
[04:43.920 --> 04:45.920]  you're being put on a list right now
[04:45.920 --> 04:49.920]  you're being put on a democrat neoliberal watch list
[04:49.920 --> 04:56.920]  that the FBI, the CIA and the IRS are prepping to go after all of you
[05:02.920 --> 05:04.920]  sold out for more than a year and a half
[05:04.920 --> 05:06.920]  because of supply chain breakdowns

[05:52.920 --> 05:55.920]  Superblue being sold out for more than a year and a half
[05:55.920 --> 06:12.920]  finally back available at infowarstore.com
[06:32.920 --> 06:36.920]  and I have one of the biggest challenges in front of me today
[06:36.920 --> 06:39.920]  with the honor and privilege of hosting the Alex Jones show
[06:39.920 --> 06:42.920]  in these historical times
[06:42.920 --> 06:46.920]  to lay this story out for you
[06:46.920 --> 06:55.920]  a very detailed formatted way of connecting the dots
[06:55.920 --> 06:57.920]  and getting you to understand the bigger picture
[06:57.920 --> 07:01.920]  and that's my challenge is to do that the best I can
[07:01.920 --> 07:06.920]  with all the information and data points that I've gathered to do so
[07:06.920 --> 07:11.920]  let me just give a layout of all the news
[07:11.920 --> 07:13.920]  because there's tons of it today
[07:13.920 --> 07:15.920]  and then in the next segment I'm going to come back
[07:15.920 --> 07:18.920]  and really lay into this really explain what's going on
[07:18.920 --> 07:20.920]  and really explain where it's going
[07:20.920 --> 07:22.920]  and I think I've got all the data points to connect the dots
[07:22.920 --> 07:27.920]  and to do a fully convincing job
[07:27.920 --> 07:30.920]  that this is exactly what the deep state is up to
[07:30.920 --> 07:33.920]  and all these news stories that we're seeing right now
[07:33.920 --> 07:39.920]  are just the constellation showing you what the picture really is
[07:39.920 --> 07:44.920]  now you've got Biden who's basically the president MIA
[07:44.920 --> 07:46.920]  for the month of July and August
[07:46.920 --> 07:49.920]  he's had more days off work than on
[07:49.920 --> 07:51.920]  and he's on vacation right now
[07:51.920 --> 07:54.920]  and they put out stories with headlines in New York magazine
[07:54.920 --> 07:56.920]  saying Joe Biden's best week ever
[07:56.920 --> 07:59.920]  yeah because he's not there
[07:59.920 --> 08:02.920]  so Joe Biden's best week ever is the week he's not working
[08:02.920 --> 08:07.920]  go figure and then he arrives in South Carolina and gets booed
[08:07.920 --> 08:09.920]  but we got other news from the Biden crime family
[08:09.920 --> 08:12.920]  the laptop everything that's coming up
[08:12.920 --> 08:14.920]  not to mention the Pelosi crime family
[08:14.920 --> 08:17.920]  let's not forget about her little escapades
[08:17.920 --> 08:19.920]  with her son over there in Taiwan
[08:19.920 --> 08:23.920]  with their business dealings
[08:23.920 --> 08:30.920]  the story of the open border has reached new levels of absurdity
[08:30.920 --> 08:33.920]  where now
[08:33.920 --> 08:36.920]  Greg Abbott who was busing illegal immigrants to New York and DC
[08:36.920 --> 08:38.920]  to say hey look how do you like it
[08:38.920 --> 08:41.920]  and they didn't like it at all
[08:41.920 --> 08:43.920]  but they still want the open border
[08:43.920 --> 08:45.920]  they just don't want the illegal immigrants
[08:45.920 --> 08:47.920]  even though they claim to be sanctuary cities
[08:47.920 --> 08:50.920]  now they're threatening to bus illegal immigrants back to Texas
[08:50.920 --> 08:53.920]  this is clown world
[08:53.920 --> 08:56.920]  here's a crazy idea
[08:56.920 --> 08:58.920]  let's just close the border
[08:58.920 --> 09:00.920]  and then we don't have to bus them anywhere
[09:00.920 --> 09:03.920]  but no now we're getting into a political football match
[09:03.920 --> 09:05.920]  a political ping pong match
[09:05.920 --> 09:07.920]  of what we're going to do with these millions of illegal immigrants
[09:07.920 --> 09:10.920]  it's a joke
[09:10.920 --> 09:12.920]  and the Democrats in DC
[09:12.920 --> 09:15.920]  are asking for National Guard and military
[09:15.920 --> 09:17.920]  to come protect them from the illegals
[09:17.920 --> 09:20.920]  but not at the southern border
[09:20.920 --> 09:23.920]  then you've got the bill
[09:23.920 --> 09:25.920]  that the Democrats are trying to pass right now
[09:25.920 --> 09:27.920]  the inflation reduction act
[09:27.920 --> 09:30.920]  Jean Pierre goes on TV and admits nobody's ever read the bill
[09:30.920 --> 09:33.920]  remember the old Pelosi
[09:33.920 --> 09:37.920]  we have to pass the bill to know what's in it
[09:37.920 --> 09:40.920]  Jean Pierre, the cabbage patch queen
[09:40.920 --> 09:43.920]  goes on nightly news and says we have to pass the bill to know what's in it
[09:43.920 --> 09:46.920]  and then Chip Roy puts out a scathing statement
[09:46.920 --> 09:49.920]  calling out the entire House of Representatives on the vote
[09:49.920 --> 09:53.920]  because what they're doing folks is they're not actually voting
[09:53.920 --> 09:55.920]  they're voting by proxy
[09:55.920 --> 09:58.920]  and then Chip Roy
[09:58.920 --> 10:01.920]  who's my representative by the way, proud of him
[10:01.920 --> 10:04.920]  told him, I met him a couple of times, shook his hand
[10:04.920 --> 10:07.920]  told him how proud I am and he's gotten better over time too
[10:07.920 --> 10:10.920]  and he puts out a scathing statement
[10:10.920 --> 10:12.920]  calling all the members of the House liars
[10:12.920 --> 10:16.920]  including Republicans saying you cast an illegitimate vote
[10:16.920 --> 10:18.920]  you're not in DC to vote
[10:18.920 --> 10:20.920]  you haven't read the bill
[10:20.920 --> 10:24.920]  and most of you are on vacation right now
[10:24.920 --> 10:26.920]  you're not even at home working
[10:26.920 --> 10:28.920]  you're not in your office, in your district
[10:28.920 --> 10:30.920]  you're on vacation
[10:30.920 --> 10:34.920]  and you're doing vote by proxy signatures
[10:34.920 --> 10:38.920]  to vote on bills that you've never even read
[10:38.920 --> 10:42.920]  Chip Roy the only one calling it out as far as I can see
[10:42.920 --> 10:46.920]  but Jean Pierre says we have to pass the bill to know what's in it
[10:46.920 --> 10:48.920]  they don't even know what's in the bill
[10:48.920 --> 10:50.920]  they want you to pass but they're telling you how great it is
[10:50.920 --> 10:52.920]  hey look this is the greatest bill ever
[10:52.920 --> 10:54.920]  we need to pass it, really what's in it
[10:54.920 --> 10:56.920]  well you're gonna have to pass it to find out
[10:56.920 --> 10:58.920]  well then how do you know it's so great
[10:58.920 --> 11:00.920]  I'm a liar
[11:00.920 --> 11:04.920]  then there's this stack and I'm telling you this is
[11:04.920 --> 11:06.920]  this is
[11:06.920 --> 11:10.920]  I'm telling you folks I know their next move
[11:10.920 --> 11:12.920]  I know their next game plan I've seen it all
[11:12.920 --> 11:14.920]  I've been on the chess board I've been in the arena with these people long enough
[11:14.920 --> 11:18.920]  it's just it's all right there
[11:18.920 --> 11:20.920]  I'm going to connect the raid at Mar-a-Lago
[11:20.920 --> 11:22.920]  the FBI response
[11:22.920 --> 11:24.920]  the media response and the IRS hiring
[11:24.920 --> 11:28.920]  it's all it's all one story
[11:28.920 --> 11:30.920]  that shows you where it's going
[11:30.920 --> 11:34.920]  now the raid at Mar-a-Lago or whatever the feds were doing there
[11:34.920 --> 11:37.920]  might have had ulterior motives might have had other stuff going on
[11:37.920 --> 11:39.920]  but it connects into the bigger picture
[11:39.920 --> 11:41.920]  of what the Democrats are planning to do next
[11:41.920 --> 11:44.920]  or rather what the deep state is planning to do next
[11:44.920 --> 11:46.920]  but let's just call it what it is
[11:46.920 --> 11:48.920]  they've merged
[11:48.920 --> 11:51.920]  the deep state and the Democrats have now merged
[11:51.920 --> 11:54.920]  there is no it's totalitarianism
[11:54.920 --> 11:56.920]  it's authoritarianism
[11:56.920 --> 11:59.920]  they're all on board it's the American corrupt regime
[11:59.920 --> 12:01.920]  it's the deep state it's the Democrat Party
[12:01.920 --> 12:03.920]  I mean you see the resistance in the Republican Party
[12:03.920 --> 12:06.920]  you see Republicans going on TV this week
[12:06.920 --> 12:08.920]  calling out the FBI calling out the corruption
[12:08.920 --> 12:11.920]  calling out the Biden crime family
[12:11.920 --> 12:15.920]  so there is no dissent anywhere
[12:15.920 --> 12:17.920]  in the American left from the corrupt establishment
[12:17.920 --> 12:20.920]  none fully bought in
[12:20.920 --> 12:23.920]  and so with this merger
[12:23.920 --> 12:26.920]  with this collusion with this fascism
[12:26.920 --> 12:29.920]  what the Democrats
[12:29.920 --> 12:32.920]  and the deep state have planned next for America folks
[12:32.920 --> 12:35.920]  is so dark and so twisted
[12:35.920 --> 12:38.920]  and so shocking and so horrifying that
[12:38.920 --> 12:41.920]  I mean I
[12:41.920 --> 12:43.920]  when I go through this and I finish my research
[12:43.920 --> 12:45.920]  and I'm sitting there last night
[12:45.920 --> 12:48.920]  you start to get real you start to get real with yourself
[12:48.920 --> 12:51.920]  and you start to say
[12:51.920 --> 12:54.920]  well I know my future
[12:54.920 --> 12:57.920]  if I don't decide to change it
[12:57.920 --> 13:00.920]  meaning
[13:00.920 --> 13:03.920]  I'm sitting here and you are too by the way
[13:03.920 --> 13:06.920]  you are too by the way
[13:06.920 --> 13:09.920]  and it made me think of the movie V for Vandetta
[13:09.920 --> 13:12.920]  the scene where he convinces the girl
[13:12.920 --> 13:15.920]  that she's dead
[13:15.920 --> 13:18.920]  in order to finally live
[13:18.920 --> 13:21.920]  or in order to free her life if you will
[13:21.920 --> 13:25.920]  with what the Democrats and the deep state
[13:25.920 --> 13:28.920]  have planned next
[13:28.920 --> 13:31.920]  I am sitting here a dead man
[13:31.920 --> 13:34.920]  I'm a dead man
[13:34.920 --> 13:36.920]  but so are you
[13:36.920 --> 13:39.920]  you are too and I realize there's basically
[13:39.920 --> 13:42.920]  there's really only two options at this point
[13:42.920 --> 13:45.920]  that is if you want to be free
[13:45.920 --> 13:48.920]  is the only way to protect yourself
[13:48.920 --> 13:51.920]  as to be as public as possible
[13:51.920 --> 13:53.920]  to call it out
[13:53.920 --> 13:56.920]  to issue the dire warnings
[13:56.920 --> 13:59.920]  because then if and when then they decide to round you up
[13:59.920 --> 14:02.920]  or mop you up or charge you or arrest you or kill you
[14:02.920 --> 14:04.920]  you're just totally proven correct
[14:04.920 --> 14:07.920]  now they might not care at this point anymore
[14:07.920 --> 14:10.920]  they might just not even care
[14:10.920 --> 14:14.920]  or and this is what a lot of people are doing right now
[14:14.920 --> 14:17.920]  a lot of rich people are doing a lot of smart people are doing
[14:17.920 --> 14:19.920]  you got to get out of the country
[14:19.920 --> 14:22.920]  folks this country under the Democrat deep state regime rule
[14:22.920 --> 14:25.920]  is going into fascistic
[14:25.920 --> 14:28.920]  authoritarian
[14:28.920 --> 14:30.920]  just a hellhole so fast
[14:30.920 --> 14:32.920]  I mean we're just
[14:32.920 --> 14:34.920]  things are happening that quick in case you haven't noticed
[14:34.920 --> 14:36.920]  somebody may get raided next week
[14:36.920 --> 14:38.920]  this place may get raided next week
[14:38.920 --> 14:40.920]  Shroyer, Tucker Carlson, you
[14:40.920 --> 14:42.920]  I mean we're at that point
[14:42.920 --> 14:44.920]  in case you haven't noticed
[14:44.920 --> 14:46.920]  objects in the mirror are closer
[14:46.920 --> 14:48.920]  than they appear
[14:48.920 --> 14:50.920]  we are now in the tyranny
[14:50.920 --> 14:52.920]  but it's like
[14:52.920 --> 14:55.920]  it's like maybe up to one hundred one fifteen degrees
[14:55.920 --> 14:58.920]  once it gets up to one eighty five one ninety
[14:58.920 --> 15:00.920]  we're cooked
[15:00.920 --> 15:03.920]  and that temperature is going up
[15:03.920 --> 15:06.920]  so I'm going to connect it all
[15:06.920 --> 15:08.920]  and it also
[15:08.920 --> 15:10.920]  it's a separate story
[15:10.920 --> 15:12.920]  but it's really important to understand
[15:12.920 --> 15:14.920]  and notice how nobody's watching this
[15:14.920 --> 15:16.920]  notice it's not on TV it's not getting all the publicity
[15:16.920 --> 15:18.920]  but one of the trials
[15:18.920 --> 15:20.920]  for the FBI plot to kidnap
[15:20.920 --> 15:22.920]  Governor Gretchen Whitmer
[15:22.920 --> 15:24.920]  one of the trials is ongoing
[15:24.920 --> 15:26.920]  and we're learning all the stuff the FBI
[15:26.920 --> 15:28.920]  was doing to these people to try to set them up
[15:28.920 --> 15:30.920]  using drugs with them
[15:30.920 --> 15:32.920]  basically sending honeypots
[15:32.920 --> 15:34.920]  after them
[15:34.920 --> 15:36.920]  and then they convince them
[15:36.920 --> 15:38.920]  oh we're going to go kill the governor
[15:38.920 --> 15:40.920]  and then they put them on a recording
[15:40.920 --> 15:42.920]  and then they say see this person wanted to kill the governor
[15:42.920 --> 15:44.920]  and it was totally the FBI
[15:44.920 --> 15:46.920]  agents
[15:46.920 --> 15:48.920]  that were forcing them to do that
[15:50.920 --> 15:52.920]  so I've got all that and more coming up
[15:52.920 --> 15:54.920]  but I'm going to get into the big story
[15:54.920 --> 15:56.920]  I'm going to show you the big picture

[20:14.920 --> 20:16.920]  alright ladies and gentlemen
[20:16.920 --> 20:18.920]  for the next three segments
[20:18.920 --> 20:20.920]  I am going to lay out
[20:20.920 --> 20:22.920]  I am going to connect the dots
[20:22.920 --> 20:24.920]  between Trump's morilago raid
[20:24.920 --> 20:26.920]  the media response
[20:26.920 --> 20:28.920]  the feds response
[20:28.920 --> 20:30.920]  and the hiring
[20:30.920 --> 20:32.920]  of the IRS agents
[20:34.920 --> 20:36.920]  they are all connected
[20:36.920 --> 20:38.920]  it will all directly implicate you
[20:38.920 --> 20:40.920]  listening to this transmission right now
[20:40.920 --> 20:42.920]  and I am going to
[20:42.920 --> 20:44.920]  explain how
[20:44.920 --> 20:48.920]  and why
[20:48.920 --> 20:50.920]  let's first just start
[20:50.920 --> 20:52.920]  with the raid and the latest
[20:52.920 --> 20:54.920]  developments there
[20:54.920 --> 20:56.920]  so there's all kinds of stories
[20:56.920 --> 20:58.920]  it's all the big news story today
[20:58.920 --> 21:00.920]  you go to drudge report
[21:00.920 --> 21:02.920]  you go to all the mainstream news
[21:02.920 --> 21:04.920]  and it's headlines similar to this
[21:04.920 --> 21:06.920]  hell week how Trump's
[21:06.920 --> 21:08.920]  problems all converged at once
[21:10.920 --> 21:12.920]  and so this is the new we got
[21:12.920 --> 21:14.920]  Trump moment this is the new
[21:14.920 --> 21:16.920]  we finally got him this is the new
[21:16.920 --> 21:18.920]  it's the end of Trump his days are numbered
[21:18.920 --> 21:20.920]  we've been through this a dozen times before
[21:20.920 --> 21:22.920]  and so this is an operation
[21:22.920 --> 21:24.920]  that we're very familiar with
[21:24.920 --> 21:26.920]  this is a play that they've run so many times
[21:26.920 --> 21:28.920]  we know exactly the route
[21:28.920 --> 21:30.920]  we know exactly how to intercept it
[21:30.920 --> 21:32.920]  and take it and go the other way
[21:32.920 --> 21:34.920]  but that's not going to stop them
[21:34.920 --> 21:36.920]  so we just have to use this
[21:36.920 --> 21:38.920]  as a signal
[21:38.920 --> 21:40.920]  that they're sending as to what
[21:40.920 --> 21:42.920]  happens next so
[21:42.920 --> 21:44.920]  we got Trump we got
[21:44.920 --> 21:46.920]  him he lied about this he lied about that
[21:46.920 --> 21:48.920]  he took they're claiming he took nuclear codes
[21:48.920 --> 21:50.920]  he was hiding nuclear codes in a safe and
[21:52.920 --> 21:54.920]  that's what the establishment
[21:54.920 --> 21:56.920]  media is going with that's what the brainwashed
[21:56.920 --> 21:58.920]  mind control victims
[21:58.920 --> 22:00.920]  of the propaganda are falling
[22:00.920 --> 22:02.920]  for now of course you know that's bull crap
[22:04.920 --> 22:06.920]  but it just shows you they're running a play
[22:06.920 --> 22:08.920]  and they've just snapped the ball
[22:08.920 --> 22:10.920]  that's all this represents is they have just
[22:10.920 --> 22:12.920]  snapped the ball
[22:12.920 --> 22:14.920]  so they're about to do something big
[22:14.920 --> 22:16.920]  just like they tried with impeachment
[22:16.920 --> 22:18.920]  the first time or tried with impeachment the second time
[22:18.920 --> 22:20.920]  a rush inclusion and they ran those plays
[22:20.920 --> 22:22.920]  and we saw
[22:22.920 --> 22:24.920]  the after
[22:24.920 --> 22:26.920]  math of all of that
[22:26.920 --> 22:28.920]  so this is they have just
[22:28.920 --> 22:30.920]  snapped the ball they've just gone hut hut
[22:30.920 --> 22:32.920]  hike and snapped the ball
[22:32.920 --> 22:34.920]  and they are running one of their biggest plays
[22:34.920 --> 22:36.920]  ever against the American people
[22:36.920 --> 22:38.920]  against Donald Trump right now
[22:38.920 --> 22:40.920]  and so that's what this symbolizes
[22:40.920 --> 22:42.920]  that's what all these
[22:42.920 --> 22:44.920]  headlines saying we finally got Trump
[22:44.920 --> 22:46.920]  this is the time it symbolizes
[22:46.920 --> 22:48.920]  that they are running a major play
[22:48.920 --> 22:50.920]  right now
[22:50.920 --> 22:52.920]  so then you have
[22:52.920 --> 22:54.920]  inside of the Trump team
[22:54.920 --> 22:56.920]  and
[22:56.920 --> 22:58.920]  and they've been really kind of
[22:58.920 --> 23:00.920]  they've kept everything close to the chest
[23:00.920 --> 23:02.920]  some of his lawyers have gone on TV
[23:02.920 --> 23:04.920]  he's released statements on true social
[23:04.920 --> 23:06.920]  and I think Trump has
[23:06.920 --> 23:08.920]  I'm hoping Trump has more information
[23:08.920 --> 23:10.920]  about all this than he's letting on to the public
[23:10.920 --> 23:12.920]  but
[23:12.920 --> 23:14.920]  now the question is
[23:14.920 --> 23:16.920]  does Donald Trump have a rat
[23:16.920 --> 23:18.920]  in his team the headline from the Rolling Stone
[23:18.920 --> 23:20.920]  with Fed circling
[23:20.920 --> 23:22.920]  Trump asks allies who's wearing a wire
[23:22.920 --> 23:24.920]  now we know
[23:24.920 --> 23:26.920]  the FBI has spied on Trump before
[23:26.920 --> 23:28.920]  we know that they've tried to send agents in
[23:28.920 --> 23:30.920]  and probably have wearing a wire
[23:30.920 --> 23:32.920]  to record Donald Trump
[23:32.920 --> 23:34.920]  and also of course people are
[23:34.920 --> 23:36.920]  worried that somebody told them about the safe
[23:36.920 --> 23:38.920]  or what might be in it
[23:38.920 --> 23:40.920]  so then there's that aspect of this
[23:40.920 --> 23:42.920]  Trump is obviously still getting spied on
[23:42.920 --> 23:44.920]  but
[23:44.920 --> 23:46.920]  did he run a
[23:46.920 --> 23:48.920]  an operation here to smoke out a rat
[23:48.920 --> 23:50.920]  could he have
[23:50.920 --> 23:52.920]  set bait for the FBI
[23:52.920 --> 23:54.920]  to do this
[23:54.920 --> 23:56.920]  those are still some of the questions that I think
[23:56.920 --> 23:58.920]  only a few people might know
[23:58.920 --> 24:00.920]  but of course they're claiming now
[24:00.920 --> 24:02.920]  the big story that drops last night
[24:02.920 --> 24:04.920]  FBI
[24:04.920 --> 24:06.920]  searched Trump's Florida residents
[24:06.920 --> 24:08.920]  for records related to nuclear weapons
[24:08.920 --> 24:10.920]  now even that's not a
[24:10.920 --> 24:12.920]  new story
[24:12.920 --> 24:14.920]  in 2019 the FBI
[24:14.920 --> 24:16.920]  and I believe the DOJ
[24:16.920 --> 24:18.920]  maybe even the DHS said they were going to
[24:18.920 --> 24:20.920]  investigate Donald Trump
[24:20.920 --> 24:22.920]  they thought he might be selling nuclear secrets to the Saudi Arabians
[24:22.920 --> 24:24.920]  you guys can pull that up in the new story
[24:24.920 --> 24:26.920]  so
[24:26.920 --> 24:28.920]  I think this is just them pulling a card out of their deck
[24:28.920 --> 24:30.920]  I don't think it had anything to do with nuclear weapons
[24:30.920 --> 24:32.920]  now some people are
[24:32.920 --> 24:34.920]  are obviously
[24:34.920 --> 24:36.920]  trying to reach their own conclusions
[24:36.920 --> 24:38.920]  some people think maybe he took
[24:38.920 --> 24:40.920]  historical archive records
[24:40.920 --> 24:42.920]  involving his uncle John Trump
[24:42.920 --> 24:44.920]  going in and getting all of Nikola Tesla's
[24:44.920 --> 24:46.920]  records back in the day when he was working
[24:46.920 --> 24:48.920]  with the government to do that
[24:48.920 --> 24:50.920]  that's kind of a deep rabbit hole to go down
[24:50.920 --> 24:52.920]  but oh let's just say
[24:52.920 --> 24:54.920]  because the feds are worried and I think this is what it is
[24:54.920 --> 24:56.920]  I think they're just pulling an old card out of the deck
[24:56.920 --> 24:58.920]  that's Trump is selling nuclear secrets
[24:58.920 --> 25:00.920]  to Saudi Arabia that's not why they went there
[25:00.920 --> 25:02.920]  they're just looking for an excuse and they pulled
[25:02.920 --> 25:04.920]  out the card out of the deck and that happened to be the card
[25:04.920 --> 25:06.920]  they pulled and they already had it there
[25:06.920 --> 25:08.920]  so they can reference that going back but oh
[25:08.920 --> 25:10.920]  Trump's selling nuclear secrets to a foreign
[25:10.920 --> 25:12.920]  country like Bill Clinton
[25:12.920 --> 25:14.920]  did with the Chinese
[25:14.920 --> 25:16.920]  never rated him so it's total
[25:16.920 --> 25:18.920]  bull but that's what they're arguing
[25:18.920 --> 25:20.920]  then the feds
[25:20.920 --> 25:22.920]  tried to play a game of cat and mouse
[25:22.920 --> 25:24.920]  with Donald Trump which they lost again
[25:24.920 --> 25:26.920]  and the media ran with it
[25:26.920 --> 25:28.920]  saying ooh Trump's lying
[25:28.920 --> 25:30.920]  he doesn't have the search warrant
[25:30.920 --> 25:32.920]  Trump is scared
[25:32.920 --> 25:34.920]  of people seeing the search warrant
[25:34.920 --> 25:36.920]  of course both lies
[25:36.920 --> 25:38.920]  the feds did not give Donald Trump or his
[25:38.920 --> 25:40.920]  lawyers a search warrant they showed it to him and then
[25:40.920 --> 25:42.920]  didn't let him have it so they never had it
[25:42.920 --> 25:44.920]  the media lied about that
[25:44.920 --> 25:46.920]  then
[25:46.920 --> 25:48.920]  last night as the media saying
[25:48.920 --> 25:50.920]  Trump is afraid of the search warrant
[25:50.920 --> 25:52.920]  getting out that's why he didn't want you to see it even though
[25:52.920 --> 25:54.920]  we never had it so they said
[25:54.920 --> 25:56.920]  Trump is scared the search warrant might come out
[25:56.920 --> 25:58.920]  we've got Trump now so Trump
[25:58.920 --> 26:00.920]  releases a statement last night saying release the warrant
[26:00.920 --> 26:02.920]  please immediately Trump's lawyers
[26:02.920 --> 26:04.920]  go on TV last night all over the news
[26:04.920 --> 26:06.920]  saying release the warrant immediately so
[26:06.920 --> 26:08.920]  the feds get played there again
[26:08.920 --> 26:10.920]  but the mainstream media will run
[26:10.920 --> 26:12.920]  with the lie
[26:12.920 --> 26:14.920]  Trump releases another statement saying hey
[26:14.920 --> 26:16.920]  we've cooperated before
[26:16.920 --> 26:18.920]  we've handed over all the documents before
[26:18.920 --> 26:20.920]  they've come in before they've questioned me before
[26:20.920 --> 26:22.920]  they could have had whatever they wanted
[26:22.920 --> 26:24.920]  Trump responds after
[26:24.920 --> 26:26.920]  Garland statement on FBI raid exactly
[26:26.920 --> 26:28.920]  folks
[26:28.920 --> 26:30.920]  they were running something else
[26:30.920 --> 26:32.920]  they were looking for something else here
[26:32.920 --> 26:34.920]  this was a fishing expedition or a planting
[26:34.920 --> 26:36.920]  expedition
[26:36.920 --> 26:38.920]  against Donald Trump that's what this was
[26:38.920 --> 26:40.920]  so
[26:40.920 --> 26:42.920]  pretty much everything that they're saying in the media about it
[26:42.920 --> 26:44.920]  is a lie so we just correct some of the records
[26:44.920 --> 26:46.920]  there now
[26:46.920 --> 26:48.920]  let's talk about the media response to
[26:48.920 --> 26:50.920]  some of the coverage of this
[26:50.920 --> 26:52.920]  specifically here now
[26:52.920 --> 26:54.920]  I only cover this not to make it about info wars
[26:54.920 --> 26:56.920]  or about me but
[26:56.920 --> 26:58.920]  to show you that they're in the middle
[26:58.920 --> 27:00.920]  of running a play right now
[27:00.920 --> 27:02.920]  which many times we've been involved in
[27:02.920 --> 27:04.920]  so I can just see it I can recognize it
[27:04.920 --> 27:06.920]  and I'm telling you this is what they're doing
[27:06.920 --> 27:08.920]  so when there's stories all over the news
[27:08.920 --> 27:10.920]  yesterday and I'm talking
[27:10.920 --> 27:12.920]  seconds after I go
[27:12.920 --> 27:14.920]  on air and say that
[27:14.920 --> 27:16.920]  the FBI is trying to play victim here
[27:16.920 --> 27:18.920]  they're still the bad guys and within
[27:18.920 --> 27:20.920]  seconds dozens of stories
[27:20.920 --> 27:22.920]  out there saying info wars says the FBI
[27:22.920 --> 27:24.920]  is the bad guys info wars saying this
[27:24.920 --> 27:26.920]  here's just a couple examples
[27:26.920 --> 27:28.920]  media matters
[27:28.920 --> 27:30.920]  of course info wars
[27:30.920 --> 27:32.920]  responds to news of attack of
[27:32.920 --> 27:34.920]  FBI office by calling the bureau
[27:34.920 --> 27:36.920]  a terrorist organization
[27:36.920 --> 27:38.920]  and then and then the wrap
[27:38.920 --> 27:40.920]  and other places Fox News sounds more like info wars
[27:40.920 --> 27:42.920]  than ever before
[27:42.920 --> 27:44.920]  so they don't normally
[27:44.920 --> 27:46.920]  like covering my stuff like that folks so
[27:46.920 --> 27:48.920]  so I'm telling you this is a sign they're running the play
[27:48.920 --> 27:50.920]  and I've been through this before
[27:50.920 --> 27:52.920]  the last
[27:52.920 --> 27:54.920]  time I got coverage like this in media
[27:54.920 --> 27:56.920]  they banned me from the entire internet
[27:56.920 --> 27:58.920]  I got banned from Airbnb
[27:58.920 --> 28:00.920]  or Uber everything so
[28:00.920 --> 28:02.920]  they're running an operation I've seen it
[28:02.920 --> 28:04.920]  before it's been running against me before
[28:04.920 --> 28:06.920]  when they run these stories
[28:06.920 --> 28:08.920]  so I say well what's
[28:08.920 --> 28:10.920]  their plan why are
[28:10.920 --> 28:12.920]  they doing this
[28:12.920 --> 28:14.920]  well here's another headline
[28:14.920 --> 28:16.920]  that was all over the news
[28:16.920 --> 28:18.920]  last night and this is the
[28:18.920 --> 28:20.920]  connection to the next level
[28:20.920 --> 28:22.920]  that I'm going to get into in the segment after this break
[28:22.920 --> 28:24.920]  online violent extremist
[28:24.920 --> 28:26.920]  rhetoric sores after
[28:26.920 --> 28:28.920]  Mar-a-Lago search
[28:28.920 --> 28:30.920]  and then the FBI releases a statement
[28:30.920 --> 28:32.920]  saying violence and threats
[28:32.920 --> 28:34.920]  against law enforcement including the FBI
[28:34.920 --> 28:36.920]  are dangerous and should be deeply concerning
[28:36.920 --> 28:38.920]  oh but when Democrats and liberals
[28:38.920 --> 28:40.920]  say all cops are bad
[28:40.920 --> 28:42.920]  when Democrats and liberals say kill all cops
[28:42.920 --> 28:44.920]  piggy piggy fry them like
[28:44.920 --> 28:46.920]  bacon and then burn police
[28:46.920 --> 28:48.920]  officers murder police officers burn
[28:48.920 --> 28:50.920]  federal buildings with police officers inside
[28:50.920 --> 28:52.920]  no problems there though
[28:52.920 --> 28:54.920]  no investigations there no
[28:54.920 --> 28:56.920]  no warnings from the FBI there though

[30:00.920 --> 30:02.920]  people say Alex Jones crazy
[30:02.920 --> 30:04.920]  he's a conspiracy theory guy he's a nutcase
[30:04.920 --> 30:06.920]  and all that
[30:06.920 --> 30:08.920]  what they miss
[30:08.920 --> 30:10.920]  is that this guy's ahead of the curve
[30:10.920 --> 30:12.920]  on so many different topics
[30:12.920 --> 30:14.920]  of signal not noise
[30:14.920 --> 30:16.920]  if you look at the signal
[30:16.920 --> 30:18.920]  and you compare that
[30:18.920 --> 30:20.920]  to pbs and npr and bbc
[30:20.920 --> 30:22.920]  and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there
[30:22.920 --> 30:24.920]  versus what your collective body
[30:24.920 --> 30:26.920]  has put out there
[30:26.920 --> 30:28.920]  and if you're sitting in a human being and just watching it
[30:28.920 --> 30:30.920]  you say well Alex Jones was ahead of this
[30:30.920 --> 30:32.920]  not only that he kind of explained it
[30:32.920 --> 30:34.920]  but he was one of the great thinkers
[30:34.920 --> 30:36.920]  of this
[30:36.920 --> 30:38.920]  that is very rare you got to go back
[30:38.920 --> 30:40.920]  almost to the revolutionary generation

[31:18.920 --> 31:20.920]  not of history not of US history

[31:22.920 --> 31:24.920]  like political science you name it
[31:24.920 --> 31:26.920]  40 plus categories is number one

[31:28.920 --> 31:30.920]  it's in the world
[31:30.920 --> 31:32.920]  the great reset in the war for the world

[31:56.920 --> 31:58.920]  number one what do you make of that
[32:00.920 --> 32:02.920]  the globalists are fighting around the clock
[32:02.920 --> 32:04.920]  to destroy the family
[32:04.920 --> 32:06.920]  to destroy heterosexual relationships
[32:06.920 --> 32:08.920]  to annihilate our marriages
[32:08.920 --> 32:10.920]  and the studies are all clear
[32:10.920 --> 32:12.920]  the number one cause of marital
[32:12.920 --> 32:14.920]  splits is that
[32:14.920 --> 32:16.920]  there is problems in the bedroom
[32:16.920 --> 32:18.920]  and the number one issue men have
[32:18.920 --> 32:20.920]  is erectile dysfunction
[32:20.920 --> 32:22.920]  ladies and gentlemen the left makes big jokes
[32:22.920 --> 32:24.920]  about this because they don't want people
[32:24.920 --> 32:26.920]  in lasting good love and relationships

[33:34.920 --> 33:36.920]  and also
[33:36.920 --> 33:38.920]  multiple times in the last
[33:38.920 --> 33:40.920]  week or two
[33:40.920 --> 33:42.920]  there's been tons of news coverage out there
[33:42.920 --> 33:44.920]  about me hit pieces about me and I'm not
[33:44.920 --> 33:46.920]  saying that to make it about me I'm telling you
[33:46.920 --> 33:48.920]  I've been through
[33:48.920 --> 33:50.920]  these plays before with the deep state
[33:50.920 --> 33:52.920]  with the democrats
[33:52.920 --> 33:54.920]  and here's how it goes
[33:54.920 --> 33:56.920]  every other time they do mass media
[33:56.920 --> 33:58.920]  coverage on me mass push of me
[33:58.920 --> 34:00.920]  boom all of a sudden I get censored
[34:00.920 --> 34:02.920]  off all social media boom all of a sudden
[34:02.920 --> 34:04.920]  I get banned from using these other places
[34:04.920 --> 34:06.920]  boom all of a sudden I get indicted boom
[34:06.920 --> 34:08.920]  all of a sudden I get arrested boom all of a
[34:08.920 --> 34:10.920]  sudden I get sued so I know
[34:10.920 --> 34:12.920]  something big they got something big planned for me
[34:12.920 --> 34:14.920]  because every other time they do
[34:14.920 --> 34:16.920]  this I get hit with something huge
[34:16.920 --> 34:18.920]  so it might just be
[34:18.920 --> 34:20.920]  a larger thing but I'm just telling you so when
[34:20.920 --> 34:22.920]  they're doing this saying
[34:22.920 --> 34:24.920]  oh and shroyer says FBI
[34:24.920 --> 34:26.920]  terrorist oh and shroyer says mainstream
[34:26.920 --> 34:28.920]  news is like info wars more now than ever before
[34:28.920 --> 34:30.920]  and it's just all over the news
[34:30.920 --> 34:32.920]  every other time this has happened to me
[34:32.920 --> 34:34.920]  in the past they either sue me
[34:34.920 --> 34:36.920]  indict me arrest me ban me censor me
[34:36.920 --> 34:38.920]  so I'm just
[34:38.920 --> 34:40.920]  I'm just telling you this because I know
[34:40.920 --> 34:42.920]  they're in the middle of a play right now and I'm
[34:42.920 --> 34:44.920]  telling you here's the route they're running on
[34:44.920 --> 34:46.920]  this issue but there's other routes
[34:46.920 --> 34:48.920]  during this play I'm just laying that out
[34:48.920 --> 34:50.920]  there again so it connects to this though
[34:50.920 --> 34:52.920]  online
[34:52.920 --> 34:54.920]  violent extremist rhetoric soars after
[34:54.920 --> 34:56.920]  Mar-a-Lago search and there's there's hundreds
[34:56.920 --> 34:58.920]  of these stories out there
[34:58.920 --> 35:00.920]  basically saying look Trump supporters are
[35:00.920 --> 35:02.920]  violent look they're mad about the raid
[35:02.920 --> 35:04.920]  look what they're saying on the internet
[35:04.920 --> 35:06.920]  and there's hundreds of these stories
[35:06.920 --> 35:08.920]  saying look see the rights to the bad
[35:08.920 --> 35:10.920]  guys see the rights are terrorists
[35:10.920 --> 35:12.920]  Trump supporters terrorist Trump supporters bad Republicans bad
[35:12.920 --> 35:14.920]  because look at their rhetoric after
[35:14.920 --> 35:16.920]  the Mar-a-Lago raid
[35:16.920 --> 35:18.920]  and then the FBI makes statements violence
[35:18.920 --> 35:20.920]  and threats against law enforcement are deeply
[35:20.920 --> 35:22.920]  concerning oh but when it's black lives matter
[35:22.920 --> 35:24.920]  in Antifa literally murdering police officers
[35:24.920 --> 35:26.920]  burning cities to the ground that's okay
[35:26.920 --> 35:28.920]  FBI has no comment
[35:28.920 --> 35:30.920]  but oh now because of what people are
[35:30.920 --> 35:32.920]  saying what people
[35:32.920 --> 35:34.920]  are saying they have
[35:34.920 --> 35:36.920]  a problem with it
[35:36.920 --> 35:38.920]  even Bernie Sanders press
[35:38.920 --> 35:40.920]  secretary knows that the FBI
[35:40.920 --> 35:42.920]  is the bad guy she says Breonna
[35:42.920 --> 35:44.920]  Joy Gray she says Marjorie
[35:44.920 --> 35:46.920]  Taylor Greene is right about the FBI
[35:46.920 --> 35:48.920]  bad faith or not
[35:48.920 --> 35:50.920]  I argue that the left should take advantage
[35:50.920 --> 35:52.920]  of the rights new acknowledgement of systemic
[35:52.920 --> 35:54.920]  bait bias and push to abolish
[35:54.920 --> 35:56.920]  the FBI an institution that has always
[35:56.920 --> 35:58.920]  protected elite power not the people
[35:58.920 --> 36:00.920]  she's right and what
[36:00.920 --> 36:02.920]  happened to the left the left used to be anti
[36:02.920 --> 36:04.920]  big government liberals used to be anti
[36:04.920 --> 36:06.920]  FBI now they love the FBI
[36:06.920 --> 36:08.920]  they love the big government because they think
[36:08.920 --> 36:10.920]  they control it so it just shows you they were
[36:10.920 --> 36:12.920]  never liberals they were always control freaks
[36:12.920 --> 36:14.920]  but are they going to target Bernie Sanders
[36:14.920 --> 36:16.920]  press secretary does Breonna
[36:16.920 --> 36:18.920]  Joy Gray need to get rated by
[36:18.920 --> 36:20.920]  the FBI is she a violent terrorist
[36:20.920 --> 36:22.920]  no she's right and she's an American
[36:22.920 --> 36:24.920]  that has free speech
[36:24.920 --> 36:26.920]  but see they don't like this
[36:26.920 --> 36:28.920]  and so let me tell you
[36:28.920 --> 36:30.920]  what the story is
[36:32.920 --> 36:34.920]  here's what
[36:34.920 --> 36:36.920]  the media's role is
[36:36.920 --> 36:38.920]  in this play in this process
[36:38.920 --> 36:40.920]  and that's why I bring up the stories covering
[36:40.920 --> 36:42.920]  myself and info wars
[36:42.920 --> 36:44.920]  the media's role is to pitch
[36:44.920 --> 36:46.920]  the ball to the deep state
[36:46.920 --> 36:48.920]  so the media says
[36:48.920 --> 36:50.920]  look here's what
[36:50.920 --> 36:52.920]  this individual said on the internet
[36:52.920 --> 36:54.920]  and then big tech swings
[36:54.920 --> 36:56.920]  and hits the home run and censors them
[36:56.920 --> 36:58.920]  or the far left
[36:58.920 --> 37:00.920]  fascist media says look
[37:00.920 --> 37:02.920]  here was this person at January 6
[37:02.920 --> 37:04.920]  and then the deep state hits the home run and goes to the rest of that person
[37:04.920 --> 37:06.920]  the media says look
[37:06.920 --> 37:08.920]  here's what this person said about
[37:08.920 --> 37:10.920]  X and then X picks up the bat
[37:10.920 --> 37:12.920]  swings and sues that person for
[37:12.920 --> 37:14.920]  $150 million
[37:14.920 --> 37:16.920]  so I'm just telling you this is the play they're running right now
[37:16.920 --> 37:18.920]  so they are actively
[37:18.920 --> 37:20.920]  what I think is going on
[37:20.920 --> 37:22.920]  truly
[37:22.920 --> 37:24.920]  and this is about to tie into the IRS
[37:24.920 --> 37:26.920]  agents what I think is going on right now
[37:26.920 --> 37:28.920]  and this is a separate play
[37:28.920 --> 37:30.920]  that's being run
[37:30.920 --> 37:32.920]  you've got the deep state and the regime going after
[37:32.920 --> 37:34.920]  Donald Trump and then you've got the
[37:34.920 --> 37:36.920]  media and the regime going after all of
[37:36.920 --> 37:38.920]  Donald Trump supporters with
[37:38.920 --> 37:40.920]  a different claw
[37:40.920 --> 37:42.920]  and what they're doing right now
[37:42.920 --> 37:44.920]  is they are putting everyone on
[37:44.920 --> 37:46.920]  a list
[37:46.920 --> 37:48.920]  to either be raided or arrested
[37:48.920 --> 37:50.920]  or charged with terroristic threats
[37:50.920 --> 37:52.920]  that's what they're doing
[37:52.920 --> 37:54.920]  I'm telling you that from first hand experience
[37:54.920 --> 37:56.920]  I'm telling you that from
[37:56.920 --> 37:58.920]  being on the playing field with these crooks
[37:58.920 --> 38:00.920]  for years of my life watching
[38:00.920 --> 38:02.920]  them run their plays watching what they do
[38:02.920 --> 38:04.920]  I'm telling you that's what
[38:04.920 --> 38:06.920]  they're doing as I sit here
[38:06.920 --> 38:08.920]  and I like that's heavy
[38:08.920 --> 38:10.920]  I get it that's heavy
[38:10.920 --> 38:12.920]  that's hard to believe that seems far
[38:12.920 --> 38:14.920]  out there how could we be at this point in American history
[38:14.920 --> 38:16.920]  but in case you haven't noticed
[38:16.920 --> 38:18.920]  that's exactly where we're at in American history
[38:20.920 --> 38:22.920]  so that's what's being done that's why
[38:22.920 --> 38:24.920]  they're running all these news stories talking
[38:24.920 --> 38:26.920]  about violent rhetoric after Mar-a-Lago raid
[38:26.920 --> 38:28.920]  that's why they're running all these
[38:28.920 --> 38:30.920]  stories out of the FBI
[38:30.920 --> 38:32.920]  saying oh my gosh threats against us are up
[38:32.920 --> 38:34.920]  these are violent extremists
[38:34.920 --> 38:36.920]  they don't use these words lightly
[38:36.920 --> 38:38.920]  they don't run these plays just to
[38:38.920 --> 38:40.920]  feather their own nest
[38:40.920 --> 38:42.920]  they're making an attack formation
[38:42.920 --> 38:44.920]  right now against the American people
[38:44.920 --> 38:46.920]  110%
[38:46.920 --> 38:48.920]  as I'm sitting here
[38:48.920 --> 38:50.920]  guaranteed
[38:50.920 --> 38:52.920]  and the only hope we have of staving this off
[38:52.920 --> 38:54.920]  is by calling it out
[38:54.920 --> 38:56.920]  because here's the ultimate balancing act
[38:56.920 --> 38:58.920]  that's been going on for the last couple years
[38:58.920 --> 39:00.920]  they can't
[39:00.920 --> 39:02.920]  at least in a short term period
[39:02.920 --> 39:04.920]  show info wars is right
[39:04.920 --> 39:06.920]  or anybody else is right
[39:06.920 --> 39:08.920]  so if we sit here and say the FBI is getting ready
[39:08.920 --> 39:10.920]  to raid say 100,000 Americans
[39:10.920 --> 39:12.920]  homes well they can't go out and do that
[39:12.920 --> 39:14.920]  the next week or the next month so they gotta
[39:14.920 --> 39:16.920]  put it off a couple years till it's down the line
[39:16.920 --> 39:18.920]  but they might have
[39:18.920 --> 39:20.920]  crossed a threshold in their own operating procedures
[39:20.920 --> 39:22.920]  where they don't care anymore
[39:22.920 --> 39:24.920]  they're just
[39:24.920 --> 39:26.920]  they're fully in control they're fully authoritarian
[39:26.920 --> 39:28.920]  totalitarian tyrants now so
[39:28.920 --> 39:30.920]  yeah let's prove them all right who cares
[39:30.920 --> 39:32.920]  let's go round up 100,000 Americans anyway
[39:34.920 --> 39:36.920]  so talk about a self-fulfilling
[39:36.920 --> 39:38.920]  prophecy
[39:38.920 --> 39:40.920]  the FBI raids Donald Trump's
[39:40.920 --> 39:42.920]  home then for two days
[39:42.920 --> 39:44.920]  we don't get a statement
[39:44.920 --> 39:46.920]  we don't get nothing it's in limbo
[39:46.920 --> 39:48.920]  then
[39:48.920 --> 39:50.920]  Christopher Ray
[39:50.920 --> 39:52.920]  not even talking about the raid
[39:52.920 --> 39:54.920]  just says well I'm not gonna comment on the raid
[39:54.920 --> 39:56.920]  but
[39:56.920 --> 39:58.920]  Eric we've seen against the FBI is very dangerous
[39:58.920 --> 40:00.920]  oh turning
[40:00.920 --> 40:02.920]  so that's their move turn the FBI into the victims
[40:02.920 --> 40:04.920]  then the next day an individual
[40:04.920 --> 40:06.920]  shows up at the FBI headquarters in Cincinnati
[40:06.920 --> 40:08.920]  by the way he's shot dead
[40:08.920 --> 40:10.920]  he's dead dead men tell no tales
[40:10.920 --> 40:12.920]  maybe it was organic maybe it was a
[40:12.920 --> 40:14.920]  provocateur maybe it was a an MK
[40:14.920 --> 40:16.920]  ultra person I don't know we'll never know
[40:16.920 --> 40:18.920]  he's dead but okay either way
[40:18.920 --> 40:20.920]  it's a self-fulfilling
[40:20.920 --> 40:22.920]  prophecy
[40:22.920 --> 40:24.920]  so oh the FBI cries victim
[40:24.920 --> 40:26.920]  oh the FBI gets their opportunity to prove they're the victims
[40:26.920 --> 40:28.920]  and then immediately after that
[40:28.920 --> 40:30.920]  happens Merrick Garland goes out and makes
[40:30.920 --> 40:32.920]  a statement how the FBI are the victims
[40:34.920 --> 40:36.920]  okay so you see
[40:36.920 --> 40:38.920]  how that works you see how that just
[40:38.920 --> 40:40.920]  played out perfectly for them
[40:40.920 --> 40:42.920]  days after the raid they had to take
[40:42.920 --> 40:44.920]  their time maybe organize it
[40:44.920 --> 40:46.920]  standoff in cornfield
[40:46.920 --> 40:48.920]  end suspect dead man tried
[40:48.920 --> 40:50.920]  to bust into Cincinnati FBI
[40:50.920 --> 40:52.920]  field office hey it's not good
[40:52.920 --> 40:54.920]  I came out immediately and said we don't want violence
[40:54.920 --> 40:56.920]  that was the first move that we made
[40:56.920 --> 40:58.920]  here at Info Wars because we're not falling into their trap
[40:58.920 --> 41:00.920]  see because I saw what they were going to do
[41:00.920 --> 41:02.920]  I knew they were going to run
[41:02.920 --> 41:04.920]  stories saying calls for violence
[41:04.920 --> 41:06.920]  terroristic threats so I immediately
[41:06.920 --> 41:08.920]  came on air after the raid and said peace
[41:08.920 --> 41:10.920]  peace peace peace
[41:10.920 --> 41:12.920]  because we've fallen into these traps before sadly
[41:14.920 --> 41:16.920]  now
[41:16.920 --> 41:18.920]  I'm never going to try to deter someone
[41:18.920 --> 41:20.920]  from executing their first amendment right
[41:20.920 --> 41:22.920]  but you got to be very smart
[41:22.920 --> 41:24.920]  you got to be very careful and so there is a
[41:24.920 --> 41:26.920]  peaceful
[41:26.920 --> 41:28.920]  rally happening at a St. Louis
[41:28.920 --> 41:30.920]  FBI field office being
[41:30.920 --> 41:32.920]  promoted by the Gateway Pundit
[41:32.920 --> 41:34.920]  on Thursday
[41:34.920 --> 41:36.920]  we heard the FBI may infiltrate
[41:36.920 --> 41:38.920]  our rally on Sunday that's the rally
[41:38.920 --> 41:40.920]  at the FBI the peaceful rally at the FBI
[41:40.920 --> 41:42.920]  office in St. Louis we will
[41:42.920 --> 41:44.920]  not let their threats deter us please join us
[41:44.920 --> 41:46.920]  Sunday we must stand up to tyranny before
[41:46.920 --> 41:48.920]  it's too late so
[41:48.920 --> 41:50.920]  I mean I'll just tell you I'm not going to be
[41:50.920 --> 41:52.920]  a part of anything like this I'm not going to go
[41:52.920 --> 41:54.920]  to an FBI field office because I mean
[41:54.920 --> 41:56.920]  for obvious reasons
[41:56.920 --> 41:58.920]  but I'm not going to tell anybody that
[41:58.920 --> 42:00.920]  you can't do that or that that's illegal
[42:00.920 --> 42:02.920]  you have a first amendment right
[42:02.920 --> 42:04.920]  and we need people to execute their
[42:04.920 --> 42:06.920]  first amendment right peacefully here
[42:06.920 --> 42:08.920]  and the FBI is the problem here
[42:08.920 --> 42:10.920]  but see these are the exact
[42:10.920 --> 42:12.920]  situations like on January 6th
[42:12.920 --> 42:14.920]  that can be used against us so
[42:14.920 --> 42:16.920]  if you're planning on going to this
[42:16.920 --> 42:18.920]  you need to be
[42:18.920 --> 42:20.920]  uber careful I mean you need to be
[42:20.920 --> 42:22.920]  head on a swivel make sure
[42:22.920 --> 42:24.920]  nobody does anything illegal
[42:24.920 --> 42:26.920]  and if anybody suggests anything illegal
[42:26.920 --> 42:28.920]  or violent you need to be on them
[42:28.920 --> 42:30.920]  and you need to snuff that out immediately
[42:32.920 --> 42:34.920]  because again folks
[42:34.920 --> 42:36.920]  I'm telling you the play they're running
[42:36.920 --> 42:38.920]  I'm telling you it because I've been on the field with them
[42:38.920 --> 42:40.920]  I've been a part of the plays I've been the target of the plays
[42:40.920 --> 42:42.920]  so that's the play
[42:42.920 --> 42:44.920]  that they're running right now
[42:44.920 --> 42:46.920]  now when I come back
[42:46.920 --> 42:48.920]  I'm going to connect this to the IRS
[42:48.920 --> 42:50.920]  hiring
[42:50.920 --> 42:52.920]  in how important that is to this
[42:52.920 --> 42:54.920]  story it's not a separate story folks

[44:46.920 --> 44:48.920]  in case you haven't noticed
[44:48.920 --> 44:50.920]  the hair and beard formula is working for me
[44:50.920 --> 44:52.920]  quite well
[44:52.920 --> 44:54.920]  I might add
[44:54.920 --> 44:56.920]  Barbara appreciates
[44:56.920 --> 44:58.920]  hair and beard support for men I go and see them quite often now
[44:58.920 --> 45:00.920]  there is nothing
[45:00.920 --> 45:02.920]  there is no more
[45:02.920 --> 45:04.920]  epitome of free speech than right here
[45:04.920 --> 45:06.920]  and that's what
[45:06.920 --> 45:08.920]  people recognize and resonate with
[45:08.920 --> 45:10.920]  and as Ward said
[45:10.920 --> 45:12.920]  you're not going to find a better place for information
[45:12.920 --> 45:14.920]  you might not agree with everything
[45:14.920 --> 45:16.920]  you might not agree with all our perspectives
[45:16.920 --> 45:18.920]  but we cover all the information
[45:18.920 --> 45:20.920]  and there's nowhere else really that does it
[45:20.920 --> 45:22.920]  like we do here thank you for that Ward
[45:22.920 --> 45:24.920]  infowarstore.com by the way
[45:24.920 --> 45:26.920]  the products he mentions
[45:26.920 --> 45:28.920]  infowarstore.com is where to get them folks
[45:28.920 --> 45:30.920]  and we do have the best supplements
[45:30.920 --> 45:32.920]  just like we try our best
[45:32.920 --> 45:34.920]  with our news coverage and our information
[45:34.920 --> 45:36.920]  we do the best
[45:36.920 --> 45:38.920]  with our supplements as well
[45:38.920 --> 45:40.920]  I mean look at the hair and beard support formula
[45:40.920 --> 45:42.920]  folks this is a joke
[45:42.920 --> 45:44.920]  I mean we're giving this thing away
[45:44.920 --> 45:46.920]  it's 75% off by the way it works for me
[45:46.920 --> 45:48.920]  in case you haven't noticed
[45:48.920 --> 45:50.920]  the hair and beard formula is working
[45:50.920 --> 45:52.920]  quite well
[45:52.920 --> 45:54.920]  I might add
[45:54.920 --> 45:56.920]  well my barber appreciates
[45:56.920 --> 45:58.920]  hair and beard support for men
[45:58.920 --> 46:00.920]  I go and see him quite often now
[46:00.920 --> 46:02.920]  Alex Jones expanded his broadcast
[46:02.920 --> 46:04.920]  by selling a line of products
[46:04.920 --> 46:06.920]  focused on healing from the toxic world
[46:06.920 --> 46:08.920]  of a corrupt system
[46:08.920 --> 46:10.920]  which has allowed info wars
[46:10.920 --> 46:12.920]  to remain a free public broadcast
[46:12.920 --> 46:14.920]  to combat the dangerous lies
[46:14.920 --> 46:16.920]  of the mainstream media
[46:16.920 --> 46:18.920]  Alex Jones is patient
[46:18.920 --> 46:20.920]  zero
[46:20.920 --> 46:22.920]  for alternative
[46:22.920 --> 46:24.920]  facts
[46:24.920 --> 46:26.920]  do you understand what I have said
[46:26.920 --> 46:28.920]  yes I believe what I said was true
[46:28.920 --> 46:30.920]  yes you believe
[46:30.920 --> 46:32.920]  everything you say is true but it isn't
[46:32.920 --> 46:34.920]  your beliefs do not make something true
[46:34.920 --> 46:36.920]  that is
[46:36.920 --> 46:38.920]  what we're doing here
[46:38.920 --> 46:40.920]  there's going to be a large set
[46:40.920 --> 46:42.920]  of planets who are going to be dividing up the corpse
[46:42.920 --> 46:44.920]  of info wars in the bankruptcy of state
[46:44.920 --> 46:46.920]  the info wars audience
[46:46.920 --> 46:48.920]  has mobilized and awakened the world
[46:48.920 --> 46:50.920]  to the threat that is globalism
[46:50.920 --> 46:52.920]  and with your continued support
[46:52.920 --> 46:54.920]  we will keep going
[46:54.920 --> 46:56.920]  join us now and support
[46:56.920 --> 47:20.920]  the news
[47:20.920 --> 47:22.920]  let's apply what we covered in the last two segments
[47:22.920 --> 47:26.920]  to a ground level
[47:26.920 --> 47:28.920]  operational aspect
[47:28.920 --> 47:30.920]  of this
[47:30.920 --> 47:32.920]  so the story about the IRS agents
[47:32.920 --> 47:34.920]  has been a big story this week
[47:34.920 --> 47:36.920]  and I'm going to tell you
[47:36.920 --> 47:38.920]  how that's directly connected
[47:38.920 --> 47:40.920]  to what I've been covering
[47:40.920 --> 47:42.920]  in the last two segments the raid on Trump
[47:42.920 --> 47:44.920]  and the FBI
[47:44.920 --> 47:46.920]  maneuver
[47:46.920 --> 47:48.920]  to posture themselves
[47:48.920 --> 47:50.920]  as the victims to then set themselves up
[47:50.920 --> 47:52.920]  as the aggressor against the American people
[47:54.920 --> 47:56.920]  so let's flash back
[47:56.920 --> 47:58.920]  and keep this in mind before we go
[47:58.920 --> 48:00.920]  to this Obama clip
[48:00.920 --> 48:02.920]  who's really running the White House
[48:02.920 --> 48:04.920]  now I'm not saying Obama
[48:04.920 --> 48:06.920]  is fully in charge
[48:06.920 --> 48:08.920]  but I do believe Obama is at least
[48:08.920 --> 48:10.920]  running some operations
[48:10.920 --> 48:12.920]  and the IRS operation may be one
[48:12.920 --> 48:14.920]  that he is in charge of
[48:14.920 --> 48:16.920]  from behind the scenes
[48:16.920 --> 48:18.920]  because
[48:18.920 --> 48:20.920]  just look at Joe Biden
[48:20.920 --> 48:22.920]  he hasn't even been able to
[48:22.920 --> 48:24.920]  operate as the president for two
[48:24.920 --> 48:26.920]  months
[48:26.920 --> 48:28.920]  he's constantly sick
[48:28.920 --> 48:30.920]  he's constantly on vacation
[48:30.920 --> 48:32.920]  who's really running the country
[48:32.920 --> 48:34.920]  he says he had nothing to do with the raid
[48:34.920 --> 48:36.920]  he had no idea about it really
[48:36.920 --> 48:38.920]  well who's running the country then
[48:38.920 --> 48:40.920]  it's not Biden
[48:40.920 --> 48:42.920]  who's running this stuff certainly not Biden
[48:42.920 --> 48:44.920]  so who is it
[48:44.920 --> 48:46.920]  well I think it's a team of radical leftists
[48:46.920 --> 48:48.920]  and I think
[48:48.920 --> 48:50.920]  they each take assignments and Biden just has no idea
[48:50.920 --> 48:52.920]  what's going on Jean Pierre has no idea
[48:52.920 --> 48:54.920]  what's going on
[48:54.920 --> 48:56.920]  and they just run these operations
[48:56.920 --> 48:58.920]  with the deep state
[48:58.920 --> 49:00.920]  and then you hear about it in the news
[49:00.920 --> 49:02.920]  and isn't that
[49:02.920 --> 49:04.920]  a story too by the way
[49:04.920 --> 49:06.920]  oh how do we find out
[49:06.920 --> 49:08.920]  what the FBI was looking for
[49:08.920 --> 49:10.920]  in the Trump raid
[49:10.920 --> 49:12.920]  did Chris Ray tell us during his press conference
[49:12.920 --> 49:14.920]  no
[49:14.920 --> 49:16.920]  did Merrick Garland tell us
[49:16.920 --> 49:18.920]  during his press conference no
[49:18.920 --> 49:20.920]  instead
[49:20.920 --> 49:22.920]  they decide to launder the information
[49:22.920 --> 49:24.920]  or leak the information through the Washington Post
[49:26.920 --> 49:28.920]  what's up with that
[49:28.920 --> 49:30.920]  you had two press conferences with the opportunity
[49:30.920 --> 49:32.920]  to tell the American people what you were doing at Trump's
[49:32.920 --> 49:34.920]  Mar-a-Lago house you didn't do it
[49:34.920 --> 49:36.920]  and then you leaked it
[49:36.920 --> 49:38.920]  to the Washington Post to tell us
[49:38.920 --> 49:40.920]  I mean what's that all about but
[49:40.920 --> 49:42.920]  let's get back to the story here
[49:42.920 --> 49:44.920]  alright so the IRS
[49:44.920 --> 49:46.920]  hires 87,000 new agents
[49:46.920 --> 49:48.920]  that are preparing to use deadly force
[49:48.920 --> 49:50.920]  they're training to raid your home
[49:50.920 --> 49:52.920]  they're training to go after terrorists
[49:52.920 --> 49:54.920]  and drug traffickers and everything
[49:54.920 --> 49:56.920]  and it's all in their documents by the way
[49:56.920 --> 49:58.920]  I was flipping through this manual here
[49:58.920 --> 50:00.920]  this IRS manual from last year
[50:00.920 --> 50:02.920]  annual report 2021
[50:02.920 --> 50:04.920]  shows all of it shows them gun training
[50:04.920 --> 50:06.920]  house raid training
[50:06.920 --> 50:08.920]  confiscation of your property
[50:08.920 --> 50:10.920]  all of it it's all in here
[50:10.920 --> 50:12.920]  and we all we find out
[50:12.920 --> 50:14.920]  all about it they say yep
[50:14.920 --> 50:16.920]  you come work for the IRS you're going to be trained on how to use
[50:16.920 --> 50:18.920]  deadly force and how to steal
[50:18.920 --> 50:20.920]  people's property so let's go back
[50:20.920 --> 50:22.920]  though who's really running the show
[50:22.920 --> 50:24.920]  what's really going on with this IRS
[50:24.920 --> 50:26.920]  story maybe
[50:26.920 --> 50:28.920]  this gives you a little hint
[50:28.920 --> 50:30.920]  this is Barack Obama in 2008
[50:30.920 --> 50:32.920]  remember this famous quote
[50:32.920 --> 50:34.920]  we cannot continue to rely
[50:34.920 --> 50:36.920]  only on our military
[50:36.920 --> 50:38.920]  in order to achieve the national security objectives
[50:38.920 --> 50:40.920]  that we've set
[50:40.920 --> 50:42.920]  we've got to have a civilian national security force
[50:42.920 --> 50:44.920]  that's just as powerful
[50:44.920 --> 50:46.920]  just as strong
[50:46.920 --> 50:48.920]  just as well funded
[50:50.920 --> 50:52.920]  I think we should play that one more time
[50:52.920 --> 50:54.920]  guys let's play it one more time for brevity
[50:54.920 --> 50:56.920]  here's Barack Obama
[50:56.920 --> 50:58.920]  we cannot continue to rely
[50:58.920 --> 51:00.920]  only on our military
[51:00.920 --> 51:02.920]  in order to achieve the national security objectives
[51:02.920 --> 51:04.920]  that we've set
[51:04.920 --> 51:06.920]  we've got to have a civilian national security
[51:06.920 --> 51:08.920]  force that's just as powerful
[51:08.920 --> 51:10.920]  just as strong
[51:10.920 --> 51:12.920]  just as well funded
[51:12.920 --> 51:14.920]  wait is that Barack Obama
[51:14.920 --> 51:16.920]  saying we need a militia
[51:16.920 --> 51:18.920]  no it couldn't be
[51:18.920 --> 51:20.920]  democrats or anti-gun they're going after people
[51:20.920 --> 51:22.920]  that are in militias they claim
[51:22.920 --> 51:24.920]  so what is he talking about then
[51:24.920 --> 51:26.920]  what is he talking about
[51:26.920 --> 51:28.920]  folks he's talking about exactly
[51:28.920 --> 51:30.920]  what the IRS is doing right now
[51:32.920 --> 51:34.920]  it's not about a civilian front
[51:36.920 --> 51:38.920]  no
[51:38.920 --> 51:40.920]  it's about
[51:40.920 --> 51:42.920]  the democrats making an army
[51:42.920 --> 51:44.920]  of minions
[51:44.920 --> 51:46.920]  who are going to be
[51:46.920 --> 51:48.920]  all juiced up
[51:48.920 --> 51:50.920]  that they have the power
[51:50.920 --> 51:52.920]  to go after their political opposition
[51:52.920 --> 51:54.920]  with a badge and a gun
[51:54.920 --> 51:56.920]  now I don't know how this is going to go
[51:56.920 --> 51:58.920]  but I tell you this is how the democrats
[51:58.920 --> 52:00.920]  want it to go
[52:00.920 --> 52:02.920]  they're going to hire 87,000
[52:02.920 --> 52:04.920]  far left liberal radicals
[52:04.920 --> 52:06.920]  who will be
[52:06.920 --> 52:08.920]  sexually aroused at the idea
[52:08.920 --> 52:10.920]  that they have a badge and a gun
[52:10.920 --> 52:12.920]  to go after the political opposition
[52:12.920 --> 52:14.920]  in this country
[52:14.920 --> 52:16.920]  and I believe that's what Barack Obama talked about
[52:16.920 --> 52:18.920]  in 2008 and I believe that's what Barack Obama
[52:18.920 --> 52:20.920]  is now running behind the scenes right now
[52:20.920 --> 52:22.920]  with this IRS story
[52:22.920 --> 52:24.920]  they're not going to be going after
[52:24.920 --> 52:26.920]  billionaires
[52:26.920 --> 52:28.920]  and I used to think this is going to be them
[52:28.920 --> 52:30.920]  about going after crypto
[52:30.920 --> 52:32.920]  and these electronic payment processors
[52:32.920 --> 52:34.920]  I don't even think it's that anymore
[52:34.920 --> 52:36.920]  I think this is 100% going to be
[52:36.920 --> 52:38.920]  aimed against the political opposition
[52:38.920 --> 52:40.920]  of the democrat party 100%
[52:40.920 --> 52:42.920]  and they're going to try to hire
[52:42.920 --> 52:44.920]  87,000 radical far left
[52:44.920 --> 52:46.920]  libtards
[52:46.920 --> 52:48.920]  to be this quote unquote civilian
[52:48.920 --> 52:50.920]  force that Barack Obama talked about
[52:50.920 --> 52:52.920]  in 2008 now
[52:52.920 --> 52:54.920]  the military can't go into your house
[52:54.920 --> 52:56.920]  so they can't raid your house with the military
[52:56.920 --> 52:58.920]  even if they think they have that totally
[52:58.920 --> 53:00.920]  bought and paid for now
[53:00.920 --> 53:02.920]  with their propaganda
[53:02.920 --> 53:04.920]  but the IRS can
[53:04.920 --> 53:06.920]  the IRS can
[53:08.920 --> 53:10.920]  so that's what I think
[53:10.920 --> 53:12.920]  is going on and the stories are all out there
[53:12.920 --> 53:14.920]  such as IRS training
[53:14.920 --> 53:16.920]  included
[53:16.920 --> 53:18.920]  armed agents carrying out
[53:18.920 --> 53:20.920]  simulated assaults on suburban homes
[53:20.920 --> 53:22.920]  and I'm telling you folks again there's videos
[53:22.920 --> 53:24.920]  there's pictures it's all in this annual report
[53:24.920 --> 53:26.920]  they do firearms training
[53:26.920 --> 53:28.920]  they're trained to shoot humans
[53:28.920 --> 53:30.920]  they're trained to raid your home
[53:30.920 --> 53:32.920]  it's like what you would think a SWAT team is doing
[53:32.920 --> 53:34.920]  they're basically trained like a SWAT team
[53:36.920 --> 53:38.920]  so is that not
[53:38.920 --> 53:40.920]  what Barack Obama was directly talking about
[53:40.920 --> 53:42.920]  and is he the one running this operation now
[53:42.920 --> 53:44.920]  we know it's not Biden
[53:44.920 --> 53:46.920]  Biden's on vacation, Biden's sick
[53:46.920 --> 53:50.920]  Biden doesn't even know where he is
[53:50.920 --> 53:52.920]  so they're doing the Patriot Purge of the military
[53:52.920 --> 53:54.920]  the FBI, the CIA, the State Department
[53:54.920 --> 53:56.920]  everything, the Patriot Purge
[53:56.920 --> 53:58.920]  and now they're going to open up
[53:58.920 --> 54:00.920]  an entire militant
[54:00.920 --> 54:02.920]  wing of the IRS
[54:02.920 --> 54:04.920]  to go after their political opposition
[54:04.920 --> 54:06.920]  100% that's what's going on
[54:06.920 --> 54:08.920]  and I believe that's what Barack Obama
[54:08.920 --> 54:10.920]  was talking about in 2008
[54:10.920 --> 54:12.920]  now he's got the opportunity to do it
[54:12.920 --> 54:14.920]  now Eric Schmidt
[54:14.920 --> 54:16.920]  there's the current Attorney General
[54:16.920 --> 54:18.920]  of Missouri soon to be the next Senator
[54:18.920 --> 54:20.920]  I believe
[54:20.920 --> 54:22.920]  he's pushing back, thank God
[54:22.920 --> 54:24.920]  the IRS is hiring
[54:24.920 --> 54:26.920]  87,000 new agents for more audits
[54:26.920 --> 54:28.920]  and in a
[54:28.920 --> 54:30.920]  since removed job posting
[54:30.920 --> 54:32.920]  sought people who are prepared to carry a firearm
[54:32.920 --> 54:34.920]  and willing to use deadly force if necessary
[54:34.920 --> 54:36.920]  now we're demanding answers
[54:36.920 --> 54:38.920]  from the IRS and the Biden Administration
[54:38.920 --> 54:40.920]  and he released a
[54:40.920 --> 54:42.920]  statement
[54:42.920 --> 54:44.920]  and
[54:44.920 --> 54:46.920]  directly asking the FBI or excuse me
[54:46.920 --> 54:48.920]  the IRS and the Biden Administration for answers
[54:48.920 --> 54:50.920]  now he's not going to get it, he'd have to ask Barack Obama
[54:50.920 --> 54:52.920]  probably
[54:52.920 --> 54:54.920]  but
[54:54.920 --> 54:56.920]  I don't think this is
[54:56.920 --> 54:58.920]  I mean sure the IRS is obviously
[54:58.920 --> 55:00.920]  going to be used to target
[55:00.920 --> 55:02.920]  the opposition to the regime
[55:02.920 --> 55:04.920]  and to the Democrat Party
[55:04.920 --> 55:06.920]  financially Obama got caught doing that
[55:06.920 --> 55:08.920]  Obama got caught red handed
[55:08.920 --> 55:10.920]  using the IRS against his political opposition
[55:10.920 --> 55:12.920]  not to mention the NSA
[55:12.920 --> 55:14.920]  and the FBI as well spying on journalists
[55:16.920 --> 55:18.920]  so that's who we're dealing with folks
[55:18.920 --> 55:20.920]  we're already dealing with far left radical
[55:20.920 --> 55:22.920]  tyrants
[55:22.920 --> 55:24.920]  we're already there
[55:26.920 --> 55:28.920]  and you know that's
[55:28.920 --> 55:30.920]  see
[55:30.920 --> 55:32.920]  let me kind of
[55:32.920 --> 55:34.920]  give you an example of where we're at right now
[55:34.920 --> 55:36.920]  last night
[55:36.920 --> 55:38.920]  Brian Kilmeade
[55:38.920 --> 55:40.920]  is covering the judge
[55:40.920 --> 55:42.920]  that signed
[55:42.920 --> 55:44.920]  the
[55:44.920 --> 55:46.920]  warrant
[55:46.920 --> 55:48.920]  to raid Trump's Mar-a-Lago home
[55:48.920 --> 55:50.920]  and he used the fake image
[55:50.920 --> 55:52.920]  of the judge
[55:52.920 --> 55:54.920]  just
[55:54.920 --> 55:56.920]  cropped and paced over Epstein getting a foot massage
[55:56.920 --> 55:58.920]  from Gislaine Maxwell
[55:58.920 --> 56:00.920]  so let me explain this real quick
[56:00.920 --> 56:02.920]  here's Brian Kilmeade falling for fake news last night
[56:02.920 --> 56:04.920]  on Fox hosting for Tucker Carlson
[56:04.920 --> 56:06.920]  so a picture of Bruce Reinhardt
[56:06.920 --> 56:08.920]  with the judge in charge
[56:08.920 --> 56:10.920]  of the
[56:10.920 --> 56:12.920]  of the
[56:12.920 --> 56:14.920]  as you know of the warrant
[56:14.920 --> 56:16.920]  and we'll see if he's going to release it next
[56:16.920 --> 56:18.920]  so there you go
[56:18.920 --> 56:20.920]  so Brian Kilmeade falls for fake news
[56:20.920 --> 56:22.920]  now look
[56:22.920 --> 56:24.920]  I watch as much media probably more than anybody quite frankly
[56:24.920 --> 56:26.920]  Brian Kilmeade is a milk toast conservative talk show host
[56:26.920 --> 56:28.920]  who makes a lot of money to go on there
[56:28.920 --> 56:30.920]  and say nothing that ruffles
[56:30.920 --> 56:32.920]  any of the wrong people's feathers
[56:32.920 --> 56:34.920]  so of course Brian Kilmeade falls for that
[56:34.920 --> 56:36.920]  Brian Kilmeade doesn't know what goes on in the real world
[56:36.920 --> 56:38.920]  okay
[56:38.920 --> 56:40.920]  and I'm not trying to attack Brian Kilmeade
[56:40.920 --> 56:42.920]  but it's obviously true
[56:42.920 --> 56:44.920]  anybody who follows politics and news
[56:44.920 --> 56:46.920]  should have known that that's obviously a fake photo
[56:46.920 --> 56:48.920]  that was Jeffrey Epstein getting a foot massage
[56:48.920 --> 56:50.920]  not the judge
[56:50.920 --> 56:52.920]  but Kilmeade fell for it hosting for Tucker Carlson
[56:52.920 --> 56:54.920]  Carlson probably wouldn't have fallen for it
[56:54.920 --> 56:56.920]  but anyway
[56:56.920 --> 56:58.920]  here's my point
[56:58.920 --> 57:00.920]  and this is why it's so important to get info wars on air
[57:00.920 --> 57:02.920]  most people
[57:02.920 --> 57:04.920]  in government, in the Republican Party
[57:04.920 --> 57:06.920]  most people on mainstream news even like Brian Kilmeade
[57:06.920 --> 57:08.920]  folks they don't even know
[57:08.920 --> 57:10.920]  the world they're in
[57:10.920 --> 57:12.920]  and quite frankly
[57:12.920 --> 57:14.920]  probably the only news organization that is
[57:14.920 --> 57:16.920]  properly prepared and ready for this time
[57:16.920 --> 57:18.920]  in American history is
[57:18.920 --> 57:20.920]  info wars
[57:20.920 --> 57:22.920]  it's gonna take a lot of time for the rest of them to catch up to us
[57:22.920 --> 57:24.920]  that's just the fact
[57:24.920 --> 57:26.920]  and that from Brian Kilmeade last night proves it to me
[57:26.920 --> 57:28.920]  so we gotta keep info wars
[57:28.920 --> 57:30.920]  on air folks
[57:30.920 --> 57:32.920]  they're catching up real quick
[57:32.920 --> 57:34.920]  they're not dumb people they're catching up real quick
[57:34.920 --> 57:36.920]  but we gotta keep info wars on air
[57:36.920 --> 57:38.920]  cause folks I'm telling you we're the only people

[59:48.920 --> 1:00:10.920]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[1:00:10.920 --> 1:00:20.920]  the names in the middle
[1:00:20.920 --> 1:00:22.920]  the places where you used to pray
[1:00:22.920 --> 1:00:24.920]  ladies and gentlemen
[1:00:24.920 --> 1:00:26.920]  telling you right now
[1:00:26.920 --> 1:00:28.920]  the next raid, the next arrest
[1:00:28.920 --> 1:00:30.920]  the next indictment
[1:00:30.920 --> 1:00:32.920]  the next whatever it is from the deep state
[1:00:32.920 --> 1:00:34.920]  is
[1:00:34.920 --> 1:00:36.920]  right around the corner
[1:00:36.920 --> 1:00:38.920]  we are now in that time in American history folks
[1:00:38.920 --> 1:00:40.920]  we now have totalitarian
[1:00:40.920 --> 1:00:42.920]  authoritarian regime running the country
[1:00:42.920 --> 1:00:44.920]  fully corrupt
[1:00:44.920 --> 1:00:46.920]  and willing to use the government
[1:00:46.920 --> 1:00:48.920]  against its political opposition against dissent
[1:00:48.920 --> 1:00:50.920]  we are in that time
[1:00:50.920 --> 1:00:52.920]  so it might feel like a slow roll out
[1:00:52.920 --> 1:00:54.920]  to us in this time as days go by
[1:00:54.920 --> 1:00:56.920]  weeks go by
[1:00:56.920 --> 1:00:58.920]  in between these big
[1:00:58.920 --> 1:01:00.920]  events
[1:01:00.920 --> 1:01:02.920]  but as far as history is concerned folks
[1:01:02.920 --> 1:01:04.920]  this is happening in a flash
[1:01:04.920 --> 1:01:06.920]  because this is what is going to look like in a history textbook
[1:01:06.920 --> 1:01:08.920]  right like this
[1:01:08.920 --> 1:01:10.920]  so that is the stage we are in right now
[1:01:10.920 --> 1:01:12.920]  who gets raided next
[1:01:12.920 --> 1:01:14.920]  who gets arrested next
[1:01:14.920 --> 1:01:16.920]  who gets indicted next
[1:01:16.920 --> 1:01:18.920]  it is inevitable it is coming
[1:01:18.920 --> 1:01:20.920]  they got them all lined up
[1:01:20.920 --> 1:01:22.920]  they got them all lined up
[1:01:22.920 --> 1:01:24.920]  and what I believe is going on
[1:01:26.920 --> 1:01:28.920]  is the January 6th operation
[1:01:28.920 --> 1:01:30.920]  that they ran
[1:01:30.920 --> 1:01:32.920]  to arrest and
[1:01:32.920 --> 1:01:34.920]  imprison and persecute their political opposition
[1:01:34.920 --> 1:01:36.920]  that was just the beginning
[1:01:36.920 --> 1:01:38.920]  and I believe they are still
[1:01:38.920 --> 1:01:40.920]  probably sitting on thousands
[1:01:40.920 --> 1:01:42.920]  of arrests
[1:01:42.920 --> 1:01:44.920]  the reason they are not arresting all these people
[1:01:44.920 --> 1:01:46.920]  is because they want to do it at opportune times
[1:01:46.920 --> 1:01:48.920]  that is what I believe
[1:01:48.920 --> 1:01:50.920]  they are just sitting on these things waiting
[1:01:50.920 --> 1:01:52.920]  and they see somebody pop up and they want to arrest
[1:01:52.920 --> 1:01:54.920]  let's go get them now
[1:01:54.920 --> 1:01:56.920]  and I believe they are doing the same thing now
[1:01:56.920 --> 1:01:58.920]  with people
[1:01:58.920 --> 1:02:00.920]  that are talking negatively about the FBI
[1:02:00.920 --> 1:02:02.920]  on the internet or on TV
[1:02:02.920 --> 1:02:04.920]  they are putting all you on a list
[1:02:04.920 --> 1:02:06.920]  and you might get raided
[1:02:06.920 --> 1:02:08.920]  you might get indicted, you might get charged
[1:02:08.920 --> 1:02:10.920]  you might get subpoenaed
[1:02:10.920 --> 1:02:12.920]  you might get arrested
[1:02:12.920 --> 1:02:14.920]  these are the times we are in
[1:02:14.920 --> 1:02:16.920]  do not kid yourself
[1:02:16.920 --> 1:02:18.920]  these are the times we are in
[1:02:20.920 --> 1:02:22.920]  more proof
[1:02:22.920 --> 1:02:24.920]  Alex Berenson
[1:02:24.920 --> 1:02:26.920]  the White House privately demanded Twitter ban me
[1:02:26.920 --> 1:02:28.920]  months before the company did so
[1:02:28.920 --> 1:02:30.920]  now ironically enough
[1:02:30.920 --> 1:02:32.920]  and I like for the most part what Alex Berenson has done
[1:02:32.920 --> 1:02:34.920]  since leaving it was the New York Times
[1:02:34.920 --> 1:02:36.920]  I believe
[1:02:36.920 --> 1:02:38.920]  but you know he trashed info wars, he trashed Alex Jones
[1:02:38.920 --> 1:02:40.920]  he made sure to throw us under the bus and tell everybody how bad we are
[1:02:40.920 --> 1:02:42.920]  but it's funny Alex how do you like being censored
[1:02:44.920 --> 1:02:46.920]  because we got censored long before you
[1:02:46.920 --> 1:02:48.920]  because we were effective long before you
[1:02:50.920 --> 1:02:52.920]  but see Alex I don't want you to be my enemy
[1:02:52.920 --> 1:02:54.920]  I want you to be my friend
[1:02:54.920 --> 1:02:56.920]  I want you to be my ally
[1:02:56.920 --> 1:02:58.920]  I want to save this country and have freedom
[1:02:58.920 --> 1:03:00.920]  for the next generation of Americans
[1:03:00.920 --> 1:03:02.920]  just like you do
[1:03:02.920 --> 1:03:04.920]  but you understand whether you like
[1:03:04.920 --> 1:03:06.920]  Alex Jones or info wars
[1:03:06.920 --> 1:03:08.920]  our fate is ultimately your fate
[1:03:08.920 --> 1:03:10.920]  have you figured that one out yet
[1:03:10.920 --> 1:03:12.920]  maybe now you will
[1:03:12.920 --> 1:03:14.920]  but the story is
[1:03:14.920 --> 1:03:16.920]  he has the emails
[1:03:16.920 --> 1:03:18.920]  the Biden administration
[1:03:18.920 --> 1:03:20.920]  directly sent Twitter
[1:03:20.920 --> 1:03:22.920]  emails asking them to ban him
[1:03:22.920 --> 1:03:24.920]  now he needs to sue
[1:03:24.920 --> 1:03:26.920]  the Biden administration
[1:03:26.920 --> 1:03:28.920]  that is completely
[1:03:28.920 --> 1:03:30.920]  obviously against the First Amendment
[1:03:30.920 --> 1:03:32.920]  and not only
[1:03:32.920 --> 1:03:34.920]  is it important for him to sue
[1:03:34.920 --> 1:03:36.920]  for more discovery
[1:03:36.920 --> 1:03:38.920]  because
[1:03:38.920 --> 1:03:40.920]  I think
[1:03:42.920 --> 1:03:44.920]  there's going to be other instances where the White House
[1:03:44.920 --> 1:03:46.920]  was demanding people get banned as well
[1:03:48.920 --> 1:03:50.920]  I don't believe this is a stand alone
[1:03:50.920 --> 1:03:52.920]  story here
[1:03:52.920 --> 1:03:54.920]  I don't believe this is an isolated incident
[1:03:54.920 --> 1:03:56.920]  where Barack Obama was doing it
[1:03:56.920 --> 1:03:58.920]  and now Barack Obama continues
[1:03:58.920 --> 1:04:00.920]  to do it in the name of Joe Biden
[1:04:00.920 --> 1:04:02.920]  so yes when you see internet censorship
[1:04:02.920 --> 1:04:04.920]  happening it is directly
[1:04:04.920 --> 1:04:06.920]  ordered from the top of the democrat party
[1:04:06.920 --> 1:04:08.920]  and we now have the proof
[1:04:08.920 --> 1:04:10.920]  and we now have
[1:04:10.920 --> 1:04:12.920]  the proof so
[1:04:12.920 --> 1:04:14.920]  these are the times we're living in
[1:04:14.920 --> 1:04:16.920]  do not kid yourself
[1:04:16.920 --> 1:04:18.920]  any democrat any liberal
[1:04:18.920 --> 1:04:20.920]  they are now activists
[1:04:20.920 --> 1:04:22.920]  over whatever else they are
[1:04:22.920 --> 1:04:23.920]  they're a judge, they're not a judge
[1:04:23.920 --> 1:04:24.920]  they're a democrat activist
[1:04:24.920 --> 1:04:26.240]  they're a democrat provocateur
[1:04:26.240 --> 1:04:27.920]  they're a lawyer, they're not a lawyer
[1:04:27.920 --> 1:04:29.680]  they're a democrat activist and democrat provocateur
[1:04:29.680 --> 1:04:31.680]  they're a protester, they're not a protester
[1:04:31.680 --> 1:04:33.680]  they're a democrat activist and provocateur
[1:04:33.680 --> 1:04:35.180]  they're a doctor
[1:04:35.180 --> 1:04:36.500]  they're not a doctor
[1:04:36.580 --> 1:04:38.420]  they're a democrat activist and provocateur
[1:04:38.920 --> 1:04:39.920]  they're not a teacher
[1:04:39.920 --> 1:04:42.920]  they're a democrat activist and provocateur
[1:04:42.920 --> 1:04:44.920]  they're a news media member
[1:04:44.920 --> 1:04:46.520]  they're a talk show host
[1:04:46.920 --> 1:04:47.920]  they're not
[1:04:47.920 --> 1:04:50.920]  they're a democrat activist and provocateur
[1:04:50.920 --> 1:04:51.920]  and they're coming
[1:04:51.920 --> 1:04:56.760]  for all of us. It is the American Gestapo. It is the American Nazi regime. It's the
[1:04:56.760 --> 1:05:01.760]  Democrat Party.

[1:05:55.160 --> 1:06:22.000]  back available at infowarstore.com.
[1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:25.520]  I had a big news story that I needed to cover. I needed to connect the dots. I needed to
[1:06:25.520 --> 1:06:31.480]  show the constellation of what's really happening here. And because that's the top priority,
[1:06:31.480 --> 1:06:37.840]  I didn't even plug. And it's ironic that you know we sit here and we see the media lie
[1:06:37.840 --> 1:06:46.200]  about how much money we have or lie about how much money Alex Jones has. And it's like
[1:06:46.200 --> 1:06:54.600]  we don't even do really like smart advertising or marketing or even business strategy. Like
[1:06:54.600 --> 1:07:01.920]  the strategy is we're just focused on truth and pushing back against the corrupt establishment
[1:07:01.920 --> 1:07:08.040]  that it's like we don't even really do proper planning for plugs or marketing strategies
[1:07:08.040 --> 1:07:12.080]  or anything. The marketing strategy is hey, let's just speak truth to power and then people
[1:07:12.080 --> 1:07:16.880]  trust us and they buy the great supplements we have. And so it's just hilarious. They
[1:07:16.880 --> 1:07:21.200]  talk like oh they had a strategy to lie about this and make a bunch of money. I mean it's
[1:07:21.200 --> 1:07:27.200]  so outrageous. It's so ridiculous. I mean we're like we're like on the edge of our seats
[1:07:27.200 --> 1:07:31.240]  like it's just ridiculous that they act like that's going on. But they know it's a lie.
[1:07:31.240 --> 1:07:38.840]  These people are liars that we deal with. So my point is in the first hour I prioritize
[1:07:38.840 --> 1:07:43.480]  news coverage over paying the bills here and that happens too often and that's fine and
[1:07:43.480 --> 1:07:46.480]  that's why we don't have hundreds of millions of dollars and that's why they're so shocked
[1:07:46.480 --> 1:07:50.520]  that we don't. They're like your audience is bigger than anybody's. How can you not
[1:07:50.520 --> 1:07:54.200]  have hundreds of millions of dollars? Well because we just spend all the money on the
[1:07:54.200 --> 1:07:58.880]  operation and then we don't sit here and try to figure out ways to make money like you
[1:07:58.880 --> 1:08:09.960]  do. But I digress. Now it is more important now for Info Wars to be on air than ever
[1:08:09.960 --> 1:08:17.200]  before and it's kind of a paradox because now that we're in the age of everything Info
[1:08:17.200 --> 1:08:23.360]  Wars came true. Everything Info Wars predicted came true and now everybody is finally realizing
[1:08:23.360 --> 1:08:28.960]  it. Now anybody that tells the truth sounds like Info Wars. I don't believe that represents
[1:08:28.960 --> 1:08:34.880]  our expiration date. I believe that represents that our time has finally come and now more
[1:08:34.880 --> 1:08:41.040]  than ever people are realizing if you want to understand the truth and you want to get
[1:08:41.040 --> 1:08:53.120]  the layout this is where it starts right here. And so I played the Brian Kilmeade segment
[1:08:53.120 --> 1:08:57.560]  earlier. He mistakes a picture that's totally fake and he has no idea it's fake because
[1:08:57.560 --> 1:09:03.800]  he really doesn't know much about what's going on in the world. And I don't want to insult
[1:09:03.800 --> 1:09:08.080]  Brian Kilmeade. I never really big a big fan. I think he's kind of a squish conservative
[1:09:08.080 --> 1:09:13.240]  anyway. But he might actually love the country. He might actually want to tell the truth and
[1:09:13.240 --> 1:09:20.920]  so he might be trying to now. But that's what I'm saying is he tries to cover the judge
[1:09:20.920 --> 1:09:25.520]  that signs the Mar-a-Lago warrant and he shows a clearly fake image that he should have known
[1:09:25.520 --> 1:09:30.820]  was fake but he didn't know was fake because he just hasn't done the research on these
[1:09:30.820 --> 1:09:36.480]  subjects like we have. And that's fine. I want more people at Fox News to sound like
[1:09:36.480 --> 1:09:42.160]  Infowars because Infowars has been proven right. I'm sick of squish conservatives on TV. I'm
[1:09:42.160 --> 1:09:47.120]  sick of squish Republicans trying to control the narrative. But that's what I'm saying
[1:09:47.120 --> 1:09:51.240]  is I don't think now that we're in the age of Infowars being proven right with everything
[1:09:51.240 --> 1:09:56.080]  that's our expiration date. I believe now is our time to really lead the way. So folks
[1:09:56.080 --> 1:10:01.760]  please continue to keep us on air by shopping at InfowarsStore.com. The supplements are
[1:10:01.760 --> 1:10:05.440]  all great. I used them myself. But let me tell you the big fundraiser we have going
[1:10:05.440 --> 1:10:15.880]  right now. Alex Jones is going to sign as many copies as it takes of his new book The
[1:10:15.880 --> 1:10:22.640]  Great Reset and the War for the World to keep this place on air. And so I don't even think
[1:10:22.640 --> 1:10:28.000]  he's put a cap on it right now. And so we're selling autographed books. It's still pre-sale
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:32.880]  but they'll be coming in next week. The Great Reset and the War for the World by Alex Jones
[1:10:32.880 --> 1:10:41.840]  signed by Alex Jones at InfowarsStore.com. The Great Reset by Alex Jones signed by Alex
[1:10:41.840 --> 1:10:48.800]  Jones. You can get it right now on pre-order at InfowarsStore.com. And I don't believe he's
[1:10:48.800 --> 1:10:55.520]  put a cap on that because he knows we got a fundraise right now unlike anything we've
[1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:59.320]  ever done really. And I understand to the audience it's kind of obnoxious. You feel
[1:10:59.320 --> 1:11:05.240]  like we have to do this a lot. Well yeah we're under constant attack so it's like a soldier
[1:11:05.240 --> 1:11:09.480]  at war. It's like man this guy gets hurt a lot. Well yeah he's in a war. Like dang this
[1:11:09.480 --> 1:11:14.160]  soldier here I keep having to fix him up. Well he keeps going into war and getting shot and
[1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:21.440]  bloodied and blown up. So that's the deal folks. Go to InfowarsStore.com. This is our
[1:11:21.440 --> 1:11:27.600]  big fundraiser we have going right now. Get a signed copy of Alex's book. He may have
[1:11:27.600 --> 1:11:33.520]  to he may have carpal tunnel syndrome after that deal. But he'll be okay with it if it
[1:11:33.520 --> 1:11:43.080]  funds this operation. And so that's where we're at. And understand this the only move
[1:11:43.080 --> 1:11:50.120]  they really have right now to shut us up is to raid us like they raided Trump. Raid this
[1:11:50.120 --> 1:11:55.640]  office take everything raid Alex Jones house probably raid me everything else. That's the
[1:11:55.640 --> 1:12:00.160]  only really shot they have because even if they try to shut everything we have down they
[1:12:00.160 --> 1:12:07.120]  can't silence us. You think what they're going to rip our vocal cords out. They're going
[1:12:07.120 --> 1:12:13.400]  to rip our voice box out. They're going to make us mute. Yeah you might be able to shut
[1:12:13.400 --> 1:12:19.000]  this. And then they say in the court hearings we got to destroy Alex Jones and we got to
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  make sure he can never rebuild. Rebuild. Rebuild. Just because you take all the trinkets away
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:32.800]  from us or you take the satellites or you take down our feeds and all that stuff. Rebuild
[1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:42.680]  Alex Jones is a man. Oh and Troyer is a man. We don't have to rebuild everything we've said
[1:12:42.680 --> 1:12:48.520]  everything we've done. We don't have to rebuild being proven right all these years. That's
[1:12:48.520 --> 1:12:55.040]  that carries on forever. And if you do destroy us it just amplifies everything we said a
[1:12:55.040 --> 1:13:01.800]  hundred times. Now I don't want anything to do with that folks. I'm so sick of the government
[1:13:01.800 --> 1:13:06.480]  being up my ass and ruining my life. Are you kidding me. That's the last thing I want to
[1:13:06.480 --> 1:13:12.240]  deal with is these scumbags. But see it's funny because I have people say this to me
[1:13:12.240 --> 1:13:20.920]  all the time. It's actually like old girlfriends. They're like why do you do this. Like why
[1:13:20.920 --> 1:13:25.440]  don't you stop doing this. They're going to destroy you. Like your life is ruined.
[1:13:25.440 --> 1:13:29.960]  Why don't you just walk away from this. And people just don't get it. People just don't
[1:13:29.960 --> 1:13:35.400]  get it. Maybe they'll get it now. If you really think walking away from these people is the
[1:13:35.400 --> 1:13:40.200]  way out. If you really think that that's walking away and trying to get away from these people
[1:13:40.200 --> 1:13:44.520]  and live and live your life is the way out of this. I'm sorry. You're just you don't
[1:13:44.520 --> 1:13:49.800]  even live on the you don't even live in reality. You're just so off base. And I don't want
[1:13:49.800 --> 1:13:54.280]  to be rude to people but it's just clearly you're so naive. You don't understand the
[1:13:54.280 --> 1:13:59.720]  situation you're currently living in. If you really believe that look at Donald Trump.
[1:13:59.720 --> 1:14:05.160]  Donald Trump let them steal the election. Donald Trump let them destroy his life. And
[1:14:05.160 --> 1:14:10.880]  he said fine. I'm going away. And he went down to Mar-a-Lago and he played golf for
[1:14:10.880 --> 1:14:14.520]  two straight years or a year and a half or whatever it is. Did that stop him from going
[1:14:14.520 --> 1:14:22.080]  after him. No. It didn't did it. And they're never going to stop. You can try to run. You
[1:14:22.080 --> 1:14:27.240]  can try to hide. You can try to back off. You can shut up. They will never stop. And
[1:14:27.240 --> 1:14:31.920]  in fact the truth is if you back off if you shut up you actually set yourself up for total
[1:14:31.920 --> 1:14:38.280]  destruction. The only hope that we have is to stay on air. But hey they can destroy everything
[1:14:38.280 --> 1:14:44.520]  we do here. That just builds a legend of info wars. And then every news organization in
[1:14:44.520 --> 1:14:48.640]  the world is going to be asking Alex Jones for a live interview. Every news organization

[1:17:13.120 --> 1:17:17.320]  if it goes to number one not a political not of history not of US history it's already
[1:17:17.320 --> 1:17:22.000]  number one over 40 categories like political science you name it. 40 plus categories is
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:29.200]  number one. Ladies and gentlemen drum roll please of books in the world. The great reset
[1:17:29.200 --> 1:17:39.000]  in the war for the world is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. We are now number 9 in the world.
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:44.160]  This is major. This is political. This could fund our war chest. Just go to Amazon.com
[1:17:44.160 --> 1:17:50.280]  everybody and buy 10 copies. Send this blueprint to the Death Star and the New World Order
[1:17:50.280 --> 1:17:53.280]  because you read this you know their whole plan how to stop them. Hit the great reset
[1:17:53.280 --> 1:17:59.800]  in the war for the world now. It's going to go to number one. What do you make of that?
[1:17:59.800 --> 1:18:03.920]  The great reset in the war for the world is the book that the government doesn't want
[1:18:03.920 --> 1:18:08.880]  you to read that most of the big powerful companies trying to control your life the
[1:18:08.880 --> 1:18:13.640]  big tech companies they don't want you to read this book. They want to control what
[1:18:13.640 --> 1:18:18.640]  you think what you do what you read but you don't want that and Alex Jones doesn't want
[1:18:18.640 --> 1:18:23.640]  that and this book shows you what's happening and gives you the sort of playbook for how
[1:18:23.640 --> 1:18:28.440]  to fight against it and so by buying this book you're going to prove that censorship
[1:18:28.440 --> 1:18:33.880]  doesn't work that freedom is alive in this country. This is a central reading and you
[1:18:33.880 --> 1:18:38.680]  know I would go right now and buy it before the censorship kicks in. It's not going to
[1:18:38.680 --> 1:18:42.800]  be available in both stores. It's not going to be available in libraries. They're going
[1:18:42.800 --> 1:18:46.920]  to try to take it down from every platform that they can but they're not going to be
[1:18:46.920 --> 1:18:52.080]  able to do it. Prove that censorship doesn't work. Buy the great reset thank you Alex Jones
[1:18:52.080 --> 1:18:56.440]  I really appreciate you having me on and I appreciate you writing this book and getting
[1:18:56.440 --> 1:19:01.320]  the information out there. If you're like myself and so many other people on this planet

[1:20:08.960 --> 1:20:22.120]  Jones. You know we're in the dog days of August right now and it's hot. It's a hot one. So
[1:20:22.120 --> 1:20:26.880]  if any of you kids out there are thinking about starting a lemonade stand and selling
[1:20:26.880 --> 1:20:31.040]  cups of lemonade you better have your books right and you better pay your taxes or the
[1:20:31.040 --> 1:20:36.640]  IRS is going to come to you with their guns drawn. You better watch out little kiddos.
[1:20:36.640 --> 1:20:42.960]  The IRS needs their cut. You're selling lemonade 25 cents a cup you better Uncle Sam better
[1:20:42.960 --> 1:20:50.040]  get his cut from you or you're coming. The IRS coming for your lemonade stand. You think
[1:20:50.040 --> 1:20:56.160]  it's a joke? These people are out of control folks. These people are out of control. There's
[1:20:56.160 --> 1:21:02.160]  some other examples of the ridiculous. And I like how Dan Bongino says it. It's not hypocrisy
[1:21:02.160 --> 1:21:08.920]  it's hierarchy. It's hierarchy. It's not a two system of justice it's it's their system.
[1:21:08.920 --> 1:21:12.520]  Hillary Clinton's above the law. The Bidens are above the law. Trump is not. It's not
[1:21:12.520 --> 1:21:17.160]  hypocrisy it's hierarchy. Democrats are above you in the food chain. They have set it up
[1:21:17.160 --> 1:21:23.560]  this way. It's the new caste system. But let's look at some of the other persecuted
[1:21:23.560 --> 1:21:30.200]  individuals. Daniel Hale is currently in prison for exposing 90% of those killed in drone
[1:21:30.200 --> 1:21:35.760]  strikes are civilians not military targets as the Pentagon claims. Yeah Obama killed so
[1:21:35.760 --> 1:21:41.320]  many civilians and kids weddings even bombed them with drones liberals don't care. So Daniel
[1:21:41.320 --> 1:21:46.400]  Hale in prison for exposing government corruption. Julian Assange is currently in prison for
[1:21:46.400 --> 1:21:51.040]  releasing a video showing Apache helicopters bombing people in Iraq who are mostly civilians
[1:21:51.040 --> 1:21:55.960]  and reporters. Yeah Julian Assange is exposing deep state government corruption. He's held
[1:21:55.960 --> 1:22:01.000]  in prison. Edward Snowden is currently one of the world's most wanted men for exposing
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:07.360]  the NSA was illegally spying on US citizens. James Clapper lied under oath about our spying
[1:22:07.360 --> 1:22:12.200]  programs and instead of going to jail he was hired by CNN. Battle disinformation you know
[1:22:12.200 --> 1:22:17.600]  a known liar battling disinformation. X CIA chief John Brennan lied under oath about the
[1:22:17.600 --> 1:22:22.120]  steel dossiers use in the Trump Russia collusion investigation. Instead of going to jail he
[1:22:22.120 --> 1:22:26.680]  was hired by CNN and MSNBC to discuss the Trump Russia collusion the exact topic he
[1:22:26.680 --> 1:22:32.720]  lied about. Yeah that's the deal you commit a crime for the deep state and immediately
[1:22:32.720 --> 1:22:36.120]  you've got a million dollar job waiting for you at a university or a TV station which
[1:22:36.120 --> 1:22:43.760]  everyone you choose. That's the that's their collusion that's their fascism. This is the
[1:22:43.760 --> 1:22:47.320]  same John Brennan who stated that Hunter's laptop was Russian disinformation and was
[1:22:47.320 --> 1:22:52.560]  a member of the Communist Party before joining the CIA. That's from Jake Shields on Twitter
[1:22:52.560 --> 1:23:00.840]  pointing that out. But yeah it's all true. And so Whole Foods CEO John Mackie is concerned
[1:23:00.840 --> 1:23:08.400]  that socialists are taking over. Boy you don't say what gave it away John. What gave it away.
[1:23:08.400 --> 1:23:11.920]  But look out John because you just angered probably half the people that shop at Whole
[1:23:11.920 --> 1:23:18.840]  Foods because they're socialists. But good for Whole Foods CEO John Mackie makes me want
[1:23:18.840 --> 1:23:23.720]  to shop at Whole Foods maybe even though the socialists that work there threaten me when
[1:23:23.720 --> 1:23:28.720]  I go there. So yeah I quit going to Whole Foods after the last time I went a bunch of
[1:23:28.720 --> 1:23:33.680]  socialists there threatened me and tried to dox me. So haven't been Whole Foods since
[1:23:33.680 --> 1:23:41.720]  but maybe I'll go back. Here's another example now this is wild and I was talking to some
[1:23:41.720 --> 1:23:46.640]  people that are that are covering January 6th defendant stories and nothing else has
[1:23:46.640 --> 1:23:54.080]  emerged from this yet. So you can take this raw information however you want. But they're
[1:23:54.080 --> 1:24:00.360]  the individual the son of Guy Reffett. You may recall this story. The son of Guy Reffett
[1:24:00.360 --> 1:24:05.680]  turned his father in recorded his father in secret recordings. He's giving him alcohol
[1:24:05.680 --> 1:24:09.080]  and then getting him drunk and then making him talk bad about Democrats on secret recordings
[1:24:09.080 --> 1:24:15.240]  in his own house and then turns that over to the feds. Literally what Nazis did right
[1:24:15.240 --> 1:24:20.680]  out of a science fiction dystopian movie. And so okay this this young man who you know
[1:24:20.680 --> 1:24:24.720]  sometimes when you're in teenage angst years you don't really get along with your father
[1:24:24.720 --> 1:24:31.160]  and so he obviously had something against his dad and then the feds corrupted him into
[1:24:31.160 --> 1:24:35.560]  turning his dad over and then they got him seven years in jail. So he spied on his dad
[1:24:35.560 --> 1:24:41.600]  and he snitched on his dad for the feds and he had a go fund me set up supposedly for
[1:24:41.600 --> 1:24:49.880]  a college to pay for him to go to college. Jackson Reffett college fund and it's gotten
[1:24:49.880 --> 1:24:56.520]  almost two hundred thousand dollars and he got interviewed on CNN to promote it. It's
[1:24:56.520 --> 1:25:01.760]  gotten almost two hundred thousand dollars and people have noticed a lot of these donations
[1:25:01.760 --> 1:25:08.120]  are are are thousand dollars or more but directly one thousand dollar donations from hundreds
[1:25:08.120 --> 1:25:14.800]  of anonymous donors. Now it's not too odd obviously for anonymous donors to be there
[1:25:14.800 --> 1:25:25.880]  but every single one of them a thousand dollars going back more than 18 months ago. Wow. Boy
[1:25:25.880 --> 1:25:32.800]  that that begs some serious questions doesn't it. I mean people wouldn't launder money through
[1:25:32.800 --> 1:25:40.160]  a go fund me to pay someone to snitch on their father though right. That wouldn't happen.
[1:25:40.160 --> 1:25:45.240]  Nobody would be paying off a guy through a fake college fundraiser on go fund me to pay
[1:25:45.240 --> 1:25:55.040]  a guy to spy on his dad though right. That wouldn't be going on would it. So I know people
[1:25:55.040 --> 1:25:59.760]  are looking into that further but thought I'd share that with you. Yeah you think we're
[1:25:59.760 --> 1:26:06.960]  living in a socialist hell hole dystopian novel right now. You think so. Children ratting
[1:26:06.960 --> 1:26:11.800]  on their parents IRS agents getting ready to be trained to use deadly force against
[1:26:11.800 --> 1:26:19.880]  political dissidents of the deep state. Yeah folks it is really getting that bad. It truly
[1:26:19.880 --> 1:26:25.520]  is now. Now let's let's take a look at how bad it's getting. This is Beto O'Rourke Robert
[1:26:25.520 --> 1:26:34.560]  Francis O'Rourke fake Beto. Listen to what he said in a campaign event yesterday. Listen
[1:26:34.560 --> 1:26:39.480]  to this closely in clip two and you tell me the Democrat Party is not in a direct threat
[1:26:39.480 --> 1:26:45.600]  to the American way of life in clip two. Now there's another decision for us. It is a second
[1:26:45.600 --> 1:26:52.480]  amendment absolute or are there some restrictions on is any constitutionally protected by absolute
[1:26:52.480 --> 1:27:00.040]  or is the Constitution absolute asks Beto O'Rourke at a political campaign of it. Is the Constitution
[1:27:00.040 --> 1:27:10.520]  absolute asks Beto O'Rourke. Folks do you not see what these people are doing. If the
[1:27:10.520 --> 1:27:15.600]  Democrats get into power I believe and they and they steal the elections in twenty twenty
[1:27:15.600 --> 1:27:20.640]  two and then and then really take full control in twenty twenty four. You won't have a bill
[1:27:20.640 --> 1:27:25.200]  of rights anymore not even ceremoniously. You won't have a Constitution anymore not
[1:27:25.200 --> 1:27:29.880]  even ceremoniously. They will they will end it. They will write legislation and they will
[1:27:29.880 --> 1:27:35.800]  end it. And Beto O'Rourke is obviously their guy that they've selected to do that through
[1:27:35.800 --> 1:27:43.880]  the Texas governor's race. We must keep this tyrant. We must keep this horrific person
[1:27:43.880 --> 1:27:50.640]  Beto O'Rourke out of any public office. He could not. He could should not even sniff
[1:27:50.640 --> 1:27:55.720]  a public office when he goes to a campaign of it and says the Constitution is not absolute.
[1:27:55.720 --> 1:28:04.000]  That should be it. That should be it. Greg Stube gets it. Here's what he had to say
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:10.560]  last night on Newsmax and clip three. We have entered a totalitarian regime in the
[1:28:10.560 --> 1:28:14.880]  Biden administration that is set on declaring war on conservatives and there's no check
[1:28:14.880 --> 1:28:19.080]  and balance for the administration because you have a Democratic House and a Democratic
[1:28:19.080 --> 1:28:23.360]  Senate that's just going to let this type of activity happen without no information.
[1:28:23.360 --> 1:28:27.400]  Congress doesn't even have information. What I read this morning was Trump's own lawyers
[1:28:27.400 --> 1:28:31.640]  hadn't even seen the affidavit because the DOJ had sealed it. So they don't even know
[1:28:31.640 --> 1:28:36.440]  the basis of this. There was another article this morning from a former federal prosecutor
[1:28:36.440 --> 1:28:42.640]  that stated you have to use least obtrusive means. You can't just do a raid to get documents.
[1:28:42.640 --> 1:28:47.520]  They didn't subpoena these documents before they after they asked for them. So this may
[1:28:47.520 --> 1:28:52.960]  not even be a legal search of Trump's residents. So it would be great to see his lawyer team
[1:28:52.960 --> 1:28:59.280]  go after that and sue the DOJ if that in fact is true. We have entered a so many people
[1:28:59.280 --> 1:29:05.000]  over the years have walked up to me randomly on the street and said super male vitality
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:10.640]  is incredible. Why does it work so well? And the answer is very simple. It takes from Chinese

[1:31:04.880 --> 1:31:11.200]  we've known and what's to come. And right now the most important thing to remember is
[1:31:11.200 --> 1:31:16.920]  don't panic. Stay calm because now is the time that we must get our bearings and steer
[1:31:16.920 --> 1:31:23.040]  the ship onto a safe sound course. There is nothing stopping we the people from making
[1:31:23.040 --> 1:31:29.800]  our own rules and building our own society. All we gotta do is survive the crash and right
[1:31:29.800 --> 1:31:36.800]  now we still have time to prepare. The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero.
[1:31:36.800 --> 1:31:43.160]  It's time to convert it into hard assets now including food, water and survival gear to
[1:31:43.160 --> 1:31:51.160]  keep us strong and at the ready. Go to preparedtoday.com for the essentials, storable foods, water
[1:31:51.160 --> 1:31:58.680]  filtration, first aid, power and more at preparedtoday.com.
[1:31:58.680 --> 1:32:03.720]  We brought the game changing product previously only available to major oil companies around
[1:32:03.720 --> 1:32:08.840]  the world to the civilian market two years ago. The bio pros for septic tanks for porta
[1:32:08.840 --> 1:32:14.120]  potties, for RVs, for your drains, your boats, it goes on and on. It will eat the oil off
[1:32:14.120 --> 1:32:19.080]  of your driveway if you just add water. But it's been so successful now we're selling
[1:32:19.080 --> 1:32:26.400]  it to major RV parks, pig farms, you name it because this stuff will eat anything that
[1:32:26.400 --> 1:32:34.160]  is organic. And it's exclusively available at thebiopros.com and now infowarstore.com.
[1:32:34.160 --> 1:32:39.320]  We sold out of this for almost a year but we've made a major purchase and it is now
[1:32:39.320 --> 1:32:44.840]  in stock for whatever your need is at infowarstore.com. You'll also find instructional videos and
[1:32:44.840 --> 1:32:53.560]  more information at infowarstore.com or thebiopros.com. Made in America, powered by God's great creation,
[1:32:53.560 --> 1:32:59.520]  it is amazing and it funds the info war.
[1:32:59.520 --> 1:33:06.520]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:37.360 --> 1:33:40.520]  This is why info wars are so needed right now. We're more prepared for this than anyone
[1:33:40.520 --> 1:33:44.880]  else. We've been on the battlefield longer. We've been in reality longer. And quite frankly
[1:33:44.880 --> 1:33:49.540]  the only way we really have a chance at saving this country is if Republicans in Congress
[1:33:49.540 --> 1:33:55.880]  get serious and if conservatives and media get serious. And I've seen that happen since
[1:33:55.880 --> 1:33:59.720]  this week after the Mar-a-Lago raid. I've witnessed that happen. So that's a good thing. But you
[1:33:59.720 --> 1:34:07.680]  know another example is last night plenty of people were playing the clip of Robert
[1:34:07.680 --> 1:34:15.600]  Francis O'Rourke calling a guy an MF'er during his campaign event which is, you know, it's
[1:34:15.600 --> 1:34:20.000]  just Beto just faking something basically, just faking, sensationalizing something for
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:25.320]  media. But they say, oh, this guy was laughing about a mass shooting. So O'Rourke called
[1:34:25.320 --> 1:34:33.840]  him a MF'er. And not a single person played the clip from 2020 of O'Rourke laughing after
[1:34:33.840 --> 1:34:39.320]  a mass shooting. O'Rourke literally laughed at a press conference after the Christ Church
[1:34:39.320 --> 1:34:46.480]  shooting or after the whatever the name of the church was in Texas in 2020. Beto did
[1:34:46.480 --> 1:34:53.640]  a press conference and laughed at a mass shooting. He literally did that. But every person I
[1:34:53.640 --> 1:35:01.520]  saw covering the MF'er statement from O'Rourke yesterday, not a single one covered O'Rourke
[1:35:01.520 --> 1:35:07.760]  laughing at a mass shooting in 2020, except InfoWars, except us. And so maybe I should
[1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:12.760]  pull that video back up. We have it in yesterday's War Room show folder. So let me just do it
[1:35:12.760 --> 1:35:16.840]  right now because no one else will do it. So the media and the Democrats celebrating
[1:35:16.840 --> 1:35:21.280]  O'Rourke today because he called a guy an MF'er, he said, laughed about a mass shooting,
[1:35:21.280 --> 1:35:25.080]  probably didn't even happen, but whatever. So, okay, oh, wow, wow, you laughed at a mass
[1:35:25.080 --> 1:35:29.200]  shooting. You're the worst person ever. Well, really? Because here's O'Rourke doing just
[1:35:29.200 --> 1:35:31.200]  that in 2020.
[1:35:31.200 --> 1:35:41.560]  There's a lot of injury, a lot of suffering in El Paso right now. I'm incredibly saddened
[1:35:41.560 --> 1:35:51.920]  and it is very hard to think about this. Any laughs. But I'll tell you. Oh, okay, so there
[1:35:51.920 --> 1:35:55.480]  you go. There's the Walmart shooting in El Paso. The crew, correct me. Thank you, guys.
[1:35:55.480 --> 1:36:00.080]  So there is laughing again, laughing it up, laughing it up during a press conference.
[1:36:00.080 --> 1:36:04.080]  Oh, it's funny. A mass shooting is funny to Beto in 2020. But then he calls a guy an
[1:36:04.080 --> 1:36:07.880]  MF'er for laughing at a mass shooting, even though he did the exact same thing in a press
[1:36:07.880 --> 1:36:13.560]  conference. And not a single person in the media caught on to that or played it except
[1:36:13.560 --> 1:36:19.800]  Infowars. So we're prepared for this, folks. We've had the sense of urgency. We've been
[1:36:19.800 --> 1:36:25.560]  collecting and gathering the data. We have the knowledge. All the other Milk Toast Conservatives,
[1:36:25.560 --> 1:36:28.640]  all the other Squish Republicans, they haven't been on the battlefield. They haven't been
[1:36:28.640 --> 1:36:33.600]  in the trenches. Quite frankly, they haven't even been in reality. But this Mar-a-Lago Raid
[1:36:33.600 --> 1:36:38.360]  really put them there or closer to the reality than they've ever been. And now they're starting
[1:36:38.360 --> 1:36:42.960]  to get it. So that's good news. The reinforcements are arriving. But boy, oh boy, do they have
[1:36:42.960 --> 1:36:48.640]  catch-up work to do when they fall for a clearly fake photo of the judge at the Mar-a-Lago
[1:36:48.640 --> 1:36:54.880]  Raid. And they don't even think to play the video of O'Rourke laughing after a mass shooting
[1:36:54.880 --> 1:37:00.360]  when they cover him calling a guy an MF'er for laughing at a mass shooting. We do because
[1:37:00.360 --> 1:37:07.480]  it's all right here. But for too long, conservatives have been going on TV just reading off a script,
[1:37:07.480 --> 1:37:11.840]  reading off a teleprompter, collecting their paycheck, really not gathering or caring.
[1:37:11.840 --> 1:37:19.560]  But I think that those times are over. But tell me how O'Rourke isn't completely disqualified
[1:37:19.560 --> 1:37:26.280]  when he says the Constitution is not absolute. I mean, that should be game over. That should
[1:37:26.280 --> 1:37:34.440]  be game over. But let's take a look at what else the Democrats are up to here. Now, New
[1:37:34.440 --> 1:37:42.400]  York Magazine and others are publishing a story today. Joe Biden's best week ever. Of
[1:37:42.400 --> 1:37:49.000]  course it's his best week ever. He didn't work a single day and he's on vacation. Best week
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  ever. Joe Biden doesn't have to work and goes on vacation. That's his best week ever. Of
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:38:00.600]  course it's his best week ever. Less is more from Joe. Joe doing a disappearing act. Joe
[1:38:00.600 --> 1:38:06.960]  missing in action. That's the best week of Biden's presidency. They admit it. By the way,
[1:38:06.960 --> 1:38:11.480]  where's Kamala Harris? Anybody know what Kamala's doing? What's Kamala up to? Carmella? Carmella
[1:38:11.480 --> 1:38:18.600]  Harris, paging Carmella. Where is she? What is she? Who is she? Nobody knows, but Joe
[1:38:18.600 --> 1:38:24.600]  Biden's on vacation. But who's running the country? Who's raiding former presidents?
[1:38:24.600 --> 1:38:29.360]  Who's censoring Americans? Who's destroying the economy? Who's doing it? Biden doesn't
[1:38:29.360 --> 1:38:37.720]  know what's going on. Harris is nowhere to be found. What is going on? By the way, how
[1:38:37.720 --> 1:38:45.120]  about that FBI, huh? Hunter Biden laptop repairman John Paul MacIsaac says FBI agent threatened
[1:38:45.120 --> 1:38:51.280]  to hush him up. The computer repair shop owner where Biden left his laptop claims in his
[1:38:51.280 --> 1:38:58.640]  new book that an FBI agent threatened him to stay silent. Of course. Of course they did.
[1:38:58.640 --> 1:39:07.880]  The FBI, they work for the Democrats. Don't you know? Don't you dare. Don't you dare.
[1:39:07.880 --> 1:39:13.400]  Share the contents of that laptop. We have to protect the Biden crime family. The world
[1:39:13.400 --> 1:39:17.600]  can't know about their international crimes. The world can't know about their international
[1:39:17.600 --> 1:39:22.880]  business dealings. The world can't know about the sex addiction and the drug addiction. And
[1:39:22.880 --> 1:39:29.640]  God knows what else is in there. You better not put that laptop out there. It's the FBI
[1:39:29.640 --> 1:39:37.880]  threatening a computer shop owner. Biden booed when he arrives in South Carolina for his
[1:39:37.880 --> 1:39:44.040]  vacation. Most popular president ever, folks. Gets the boo birds. Fauci throws out a first
[1:39:44.040 --> 1:39:48.960]  pitch in Seattle, gets booed. Biden shows up in South Carolina on vacation, gets booed.
[1:39:48.960 --> 1:39:53.520]  You wonder why they don't put Biden in public, folks? You know why Biden's not doing rallies
[1:39:53.520 --> 1:39:58.520]  and Biden's not having public events and press conferences? Because they know anywhere he
[1:39:58.520 --> 1:40:06.000]  goes he's going to get booed. He's going to get booed. And there's going to be more anti-Biden
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:15.040]  people there than pro-Biden people. Really, you can't even find pro-Biden people. There
[1:40:15.040 --> 1:40:19.720]  are only anti-Biden people. So he doesn't do public events. He doesn't do campaign events.
[1:40:19.720 --> 1:40:26.400]  He does nothing because he is wildly disliked and unpopular. And they have to keep that
[1:40:26.400 --> 1:40:40.760]  hidden from the public. Latest poll from Issues and Insights. 59% of Americans are worried
[1:40:40.760 --> 1:40:47.280]  about Biden's mental health. 59% of Americans worried about Biden's mental health, meaning
[1:40:47.280 --> 1:40:54.440]  that 41% of Americans don't have a clue what's going on. Twitter announces plan to protect
[1:40:54.440 --> 1:41:01.240]  November midterm elections. So they're showing you their hand here, folks. They're showing
[1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:05.640]  you their hand. They're going to do the exact same thing they did in 2020 to protect the
[1:41:05.640 --> 1:41:08.680]  Biden crime family and get them into the White House, just like they censored the Hunter
[1:41:08.680 --> 1:41:17.280]  Biden laptop story, censored the video of Joe Biden at the CFR, bribing Ukraine. They're
[1:41:17.280 --> 1:41:21.200]  going to censor anything negative about Democrats. They're going to censor anything negative about
[1:41:21.200 --> 1:41:25.760]  Biden as we head into the 2020 midterm season, which we're in right now. So they're showing
[1:41:25.760 --> 1:41:29.640]  you their hand. The internet censorship to protect the Democrats is on. The internet
[1:41:29.640 --> 1:41:35.640]  censorship to protect the Biden family is on. Talk about rigging elections. Talk about
[1:41:35.640 --> 1:41:43.560]  meddling in elections. Talk about Nazi tactics. It's the same, same group doing it again.
[1:41:43.560 --> 1:41:50.000]  The American left, the Democrats. So get ready for that. Get ready for mass purging and censorship
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:55.480]  on Twitter any day now. Anybody on Twitter criticizing Biden, anybody on Twitter criticizing
[1:41:55.480 --> 1:42:01.880]  Democrats head of the midterms, your days on Twitter are numbered. They are certainly
[1:42:01.880 --> 1:42:08.960]  numbered. But hey, I think we can trust Merrick Garland. He seems like a straight shooter,
[1:42:08.960 --> 1:42:14.000]  doesn't he? He seems like a real smart guy and a straight shooter. And so again, let's
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:21.880]  just get reminded here by Merrick Garland in clip five that the FBI is your friend.
[1:42:21.880 --> 1:42:28.560]  Upholding the rule of law means applying the law evenly, without fear or favor. Under
[1:42:28.560 --> 1:42:34.600]  my watch, that is precisely what the Justice Department is doing. Upholding the rule of
[1:42:34.600 --> 1:42:43.400]  law means applying the law evenly, without fear or favor. Under my watch, that is precisely
[1:42:43.400 --> 1:42:50.840]  what the Justice Department is doing. Ah, yes, I trust you. I trust you, Merrick Garland.
[1:42:50.840 --> 1:42:55.360]  There's no two standard of justice. There's no hierarchy of power in this country. He's
[1:42:55.360 --> 1:43:01.320]  right. I should just listen to him. If you say Alex Jones crazy, he's a conspiracy
[1:43:01.320 --> 1:43:07.600]  theory guy, he's a nutcase. He got these rants and all that. What they miss is that this
[1:43:07.600 --> 1:43:13.240]  guy's ahead of the curve on so many different topics of signal, not noise. If you look at
[1:43:13.240 --> 1:43:20.440]  the signal and you compare that to PBS and NPR and BBC and we'll do what Alex Jones put
[1:43:20.440 --> 1:43:25.760]  out there versus what your collective body has put out there. And if you're a sent in
[1:43:25.760 --> 1:43:28.960]  a human being and just watching it and you say, well, God, Alex Jones is ahead of this.
[1:43:28.960 --> 1:43:33.800]  Not only that, he kind of explained it. You are one of the great thinkers of this. That
[1:43:33.800 --> 1:43:38.720]  is very rare. You've got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation and see that
[1:43:38.720 --> 1:43:42.320]  in this new book. I got to tell you when Tony Lyons first approached me, I read this thing,
[1:43:42.320 --> 1:43:47.080]  I go, this is it. This is no Beatrix. You're not going to be flipping pages or you're
[1:43:47.080 --> 1:43:49.320]  going to be having a pin out and you're going to be underlying stuff.

[1:43:57.440 --> 1:44:03.280]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a rancher,
[1:44:03.280 --> 1:44:08.440]  a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire. Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[1:44:08.440 --> 1:44:12.520]  You see it every year. Thirty different tax returns, thirty different answers. Fifty different
[1:44:12.520 --> 1:44:17.840]  tax returns, fifty different answers. And almost all of them just screw you over, especially
[1:44:17.840 --> 1:44:21.920]  the big firms and the big tax groups, because they're part of the system and they don't
[1:44:21.920 --> 1:44:26.200]  want the general public understanding this and knowing this show. It's a very important
[1:44:26.200 --> 1:44:32.240]  situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody. To be able to
[1:44:32.240 --> 1:44:36.000]  do things tax wise, it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of your money.
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:41.560]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years. The

[1:47:09.600 --> 1:47:24.840]  I want to thank you for caring about your own future because if you don't care about
[1:47:24.840 --> 1:47:28.640]  your own future, you won't be politically and culturally active and I won't have a
[1:47:28.640 --> 1:47:33.920]  future. And it's the same thing goes for myself. If I don't care, if I'm not engaged, you're
[1:47:33.920 --> 1:47:38.840]  not going to live in a free country or a safe planet. You see, that's why the info war's
[1:47:38.840 --> 1:47:43.760]  audience is so important because you're activists that understand the great reset and understand
[1:47:43.760 --> 1:47:47.600]  who the global star and how they're the main threat against humanity. I just want to thank
[1:47:47.600 --> 1:47:51.320]  you again for tuning in. I want to thank you for sharing this information and I want to
[1:47:51.320 --> 1:47:56.960]  encourage you to realize that the globalists see info wars as a beachhead that they've
[1:47:56.960 --> 1:48:02.080]  got to take down in order to finish their destruction of America and the enslavement
[1:48:02.080 --> 1:48:07.640]  of the entire planet. It is so critical now more than ever to understand the enemies of
[1:48:07.640 --> 1:48:13.160]  humanity see censoring and shutting down info wars as one of their primary missions
[1:48:13.160 --> 1:48:18.480]  for a very good reason. We have been, thanks to your support, one of if not the most effective
[1:48:18.480 --> 1:48:23.920]  outlets exposing their blueprint and their operations. And that's what my new book, The
[1:48:23.920 --> 1:48:27.960]  Great Reset and the War for the World lays out. The globalists plan to collapse the world
[1:48:27.960 --> 1:48:33.960]  economy for their war against the world to finish their criminal takeover. The book starts
[1:48:33.960 --> 1:48:38.400]  shipping in late August, just about a week and a half or so. And you can pre-order the
[1:48:38.400 --> 1:48:43.120]  book right now, whether it's unsigned or signed. Now the signed books cost more than
[1:48:43.120 --> 1:48:47.840]  the unsigned because it's a fundraiser to help keep us on the air. We need a serious
[1:48:47.840 --> 1:48:52.040]  war chest to fight the democratic party and the deep state is trying to shut us down.
[1:48:52.040 --> 1:48:56.560]  We have a plan to stay on the air. We will stay on the air if you decide to support
[1:48:56.560 --> 1:49:00.480]  info wars, which many of you have done. But if you haven't supported info wars, I would
[1:49:00.480 --> 1:49:05.640]  encourage you now to be part of history and go to infowarshore.com and get a signed copy
[1:49:05.640 --> 1:49:09.280]  of The Great Reset and The War for the World. We also have a lot of other great items. They're
[1:49:09.280 --> 1:49:14.520]  now finally back in stock like vitamin mineral fusion, bodies ultimate turmeric formula,

[1:49:29.600 --> 1:49:33.400]  world, having iodine deficiencies, you need to research iodine deficiencies and realize
[1:49:33.400 --> 1:49:38.480]  what the globalists are pushing so hard to make sure that the general public does not
[1:49:38.480 --> 1:49:43.760]  discover this and continues to have massive deficiencies of the critical element, iodine.
[1:49:43.760 --> 1:49:47.520]  You will die without iodine. And most iodine in the environment, in the soil and in the
[1:49:47.520 --> 1:49:53.720]  fish is bound to other elements, so it's not fully absorbable. This iodine is truly atomic,
[1:49:53.720 --> 1:49:57.200]  the very best out there does incredible things. And with a couple of super metal vitality,
[1:49:57.200 --> 1:50:02.040]  it is a game changer. That's our new special running right now for limited time, 40% off

[1:50:06.200 --> 1:50:10.200]  back to Owen Schreuer, Elijah Schaefer and other special guests today, and we're willing
[1:50:10.200 --> 1:50:14.520]  I'll be back this Sunday, four to six PM hosting and on Monday. God bless and again, thank
[1:50:14.520 --> 1:50:16.640]  you for being part of the fight for the human future.
[1:50:16.640 --> 1:50:23.040]  And let me just say this, Alex is working right now while on the road and you may be
[1:50:23.040 --> 1:50:28.000]  seeing another big powerful Alex Jones interview coming up in the near future as well. I'm
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:37.600]  not at liberty to discuss yet, but it'll probably be out there soon. You know, I covered this
[1:50:37.600 --> 1:50:41.760]  in the first hour, by the way, Elijah Schaefer is coming up in the next hour. I covered this
[1:50:41.760 --> 1:50:55.720]  in the first hour and I just, I have, I have a self-preservational instinctual reaction
[1:50:55.720 --> 1:51:05.080]  to this. That is just as human as it gets, but I have to, I have to somehow apply that
[1:51:05.080 --> 1:51:11.960]  to everyone else to try to get you to understand. So listen to what Oliver Darcy published.
[1:51:11.960 --> 1:51:20.160]  I think it was last night. Oliver says this info wars host is right. Here's a sentence.
[1:51:20.160 --> 1:51:27.560]  I never thought I'd ever write info wars host Owen Schreuer is spot on at least in regard
[1:51:27.560 --> 1:51:31.320]  to what he said about Fox News Thursday. Now I'm not going to go into the full statement.
[1:51:31.320 --> 1:51:35.800]  I've already covered this story earlier on today. I just, I just have to reiterate and
[1:51:35.800 --> 1:51:40.920]  re-explain something here. Folks, I'm, they are in the middle of running an operation
[1:51:40.920 --> 1:51:45.080]  right now. I've been in the middle of these operations before. I've been a target of
[1:51:45.080 --> 1:51:52.040]  these operations before. It's like, it's like being on a football field against your division
[1:51:52.040 --> 1:51:56.920]  rival and they're running their go to play and I'm the free safety around the middle
[1:51:56.920 --> 1:52:02.240]  linebacker and I call out to my defense, Hey, they're running the bubble screen 23 bubble
[1:52:02.240 --> 1:52:07.880]  screen 23. Like I'm telling you, they're running a play. They're getting ready for mass censorship.
[1:52:07.880 --> 1:52:13.960]  They're probably getting ready for mass arrests because with each, with each play, the next
[1:52:13.960 --> 1:52:25.280]  play gets more extreme impeachment, impeachment, charges, raids, arrests. See how it goes.
[1:52:25.280 --> 1:52:30.920]  So I'm just telling you, the onsalot coverage of Owen Schreuer, it's not about me. It's about
[1:52:30.920 --> 1:52:38.200]  there in the middle of running a play. I'm just kind of the decoy that they're using
[1:52:38.200 --> 1:52:44.760]  to justify their actions saying, Oh, look, they say the FBI is bad. Oh, look, they say
[1:52:44.760 --> 1:52:49.760]  Fox News sounds like info wars. So what? Okay, so if you criticize the FBI, you're now going
[1:52:49.760 --> 1:52:53.240]  to get raided. You're going to be put on a terror watch list. And if you're on Fox News
[1:52:53.240 --> 1:52:59.360]  and you dare to sound anything like info wars, you're going to get sued. So that's the operation
[1:52:59.360 --> 1:53:05.560]  they're running right now. And I'm just honestly, I'm just sitting here like it's just it's
[1:53:05.560 --> 1:53:18.000]  surreal because they want to shut down and off air so bad. And they thought that the
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:24.640]  court case from last week and two weeks ago was was like the final nail in the coffin.
[1:53:24.640 --> 1:53:29.040]  And yet we're still on air. Our ratings are up more than ever before. I mean, folks, I
[1:53:29.040 --> 1:53:32.520]  didn't want to cover this stuff because I don't want to touch it with a 10 foot pole.
[1:53:32.520 --> 1:53:35.840]  And if other and other people should be covering it, but but I mean, you realize that they're
[1:53:35.840 --> 1:53:41.280]  now publishing stories talking about how info wars ratings are up since the since the case
[1:53:41.280 --> 1:53:49.760]  and how purchases at our store are up since the case. It's like, so it's this paradox
[1:53:49.760 --> 1:53:54.520]  like they think they've destroyed us. They think this is the end of info wars, but they're
[1:53:54.520 --> 1:53:58.920]  all tuning in now more than ever before. And I'm not just talking about the audience that
[1:53:58.920 --> 1:54:02.080]  tunes in to get information or likes us or wants to hear what's really going on in the
[1:54:02.080 --> 1:54:07.280]  world. I'm talking about the enemies of truth. I'm talking about the enemies of America.
[1:54:07.280 --> 1:54:12.560]  I'm talking about the enemies as they view it of info wars. They're tuned in more than
[1:54:12.560 --> 1:54:16.320]  ever before. They're writing more stories about us than ever before. They're more obsessed
[1:54:16.320 --> 1:54:23.880]  with us than ever before. Like what are you going to do without us? You'll have nothing.
[1:54:23.880 --> 1:54:39.160]  So we are just living in unreal times, unreal times. And my selfish fear is this, that I'm
[1:54:39.160 --> 1:54:45.200]  going to be destroyed and that my life is going to be ruined. That is my selfish fear.
[1:54:45.200 --> 1:54:52.760]  And that's probably my destiny. And that sucks because I love life. I love the human experience.
[1:54:52.760 --> 1:54:59.840]  I love it. I like food. I like people. I like art. I like culture. I like nature. I love
[1:54:59.840 --> 1:55:05.880]  life. I freaking love it, man. It gets me high, dude. And they want to rip my experience
[1:55:05.880 --> 1:55:10.960]  away. They want to make sure I don't get to experience this magical divine consciousness.
[1:55:10.960 --> 1:55:15.240]  And that sucks because I love it so much. I live my life to the fullest. And they want
[1:55:15.240 --> 1:55:20.840]  to make sure I can't. But okay, that's my selfish response. When I remove myself and
[1:55:20.840 --> 1:55:28.240]  I transcend it, I say, wow, I'm going to be completely destroyed. And then God is going
[1:55:28.240 --> 1:55:34.480]  to use me as a tool to save the planet from tyranny. Wow, what an epic destiny. How could
[1:55:34.480 --> 1:55:42.600]  I ask for anything better? But selfishly, like my body says, no, I don't want that. But you
[1:55:42.600 --> 1:55:46.280]  transcend that in your spirit and your mind and your soul and you say, that's the greatest
[1:55:46.280 --> 1:55:52.400]  destiny of all time. But I still don't even want it. But that's where this is going. So
[1:55:52.400 --> 1:55:59.320]  I mean, look, here's what, oh, the FBI, they're the good guys. No, no, no, they just get caught
[1:55:59.320 --> 1:56:03.240]  running operations against the American people like they did in Michigan. I mean, how is
[1:56:03.240 --> 1:56:11.040]  this even a debate? What is it? 18 FBI agents set up a trap, an entrapment scheme where they
[1:56:11.040 --> 1:56:15.840]  talk about kidnapping the governor of Michigan or killing the governor of Michigan. FBI agents
[1:56:15.840 --> 1:56:20.240]  doing that. And then they're able to get some some people like three or four people to go
[1:56:20.240 --> 1:56:23.960]  along with it and text message threads. And so the agents are like, yeah, let's kidnap,
[1:56:23.960 --> 1:56:28.800]  let's kill the governor. And then they record these guys they've set up, they've drawn in
[1:56:28.800 --> 1:56:33.560]  and set up saying the same things. And then it gets presented in court. There's a bunch
[1:56:33.560 --> 1:56:38.080]  of stories out there. Here's one headline suspect in secret recording played at trial
[1:56:38.080 --> 1:56:42.600]  suggested killing governor, witness security detail, but it's the FBI setting up and trapping
[1:56:42.600 --> 1:56:46.920]  them. So the FBI can say kidnap the governor, the FBI can say kill the governor, but that's
[1:56:46.920 --> 1:56:52.560]  okay. Their FBI agents, they didn't mean it. But if you get set up by the FBI and they
[1:56:52.560 --> 1:56:58.440]  set you up and they record you, you can't use that as a defense. But so what is the
[1:56:58.440 --> 1:57:05.160]  real operation here? They run a false flag operation. Look conservatives want to kidnap
[1:57:05.160 --> 1:57:09.480]  the governor of Michigan, total false flag, total federal government operation. They
[1:57:09.480 --> 1:57:15.240]  did it, they ran the whole thing. And then the lead FBI agent on that operation beats
[1:57:15.240 --> 1:57:21.640]  his wife at an orgy. Yeah, they have a type over there at the FBI, don't they? And then
[1:57:21.640 --> 1:57:26.560]  they're in trial right now, one of the trials. And it's all coming out that the FBI set this
[1:57:26.560 --> 1:57:30.440]  guy up. But it's still being used against him like, Hey, even though you guys set up
[1:57:30.440 --> 1:57:35.440]  by the FBI, you still said this stuff. And you know, they did the exact same thing on
[1:57:35.440 --> 1:57:39.240]  January six, most likely with people like Ray Epps. And God bless the people that were
[1:57:39.240 --> 1:57:43.680]  outside the DC gulag last night praying for the political prisoners being tortured right
[1:57:43.680 --> 1:57:53.160]  now by the Democrat Party sold out for more than a year and a half because of supply chain

[1:58:49.320 --> 1:58:55.200]  expanded his broadcast by selling a line of products focused on healing from the toxic
[1:58:55.200 --> 1:59:01.800]  world of a corrupt system, which has allowed info wars to remain a free public broadcast
[1:59:01.800 --> 1:59:11.440]  to combat the dangerous lies of the mainstream media. Alex Jones is patient zero for alternative
[1:59:11.440 --> 1:59:19.080]  facts. Do you understand what I have said? Yes, I believe what I said was true. Yes,
[1:59:19.080 --> 1:59:23.480]  you believe everything you say is true, but it isn't. Your beliefs do not make something
[1:59:23.480 --> 1:59:30.600]  true. That is, that is what we're doing here. There's going to be a large set of plaintiffs
[1:59:30.600 --> 1:59:34.480]  who are going to be dividing up the corpse of info wars in the bankruptcy estate. The
[1:59:34.480 --> 1:59:40.680]  info wars audience has mobilized and awakened the world to the threat that is globalism
[1:59:40.680 --> 1:59:47.640]  and with your continued support, we will keep going. Join us now and support the info war.
[1:59:47.640 --> 2:00:12.920]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:00:12.920 --> 2:00:27.920]  Quickly here, let's not forget about what's being done to us by our government. Let's
[2:00:27.920 --> 2:00:34.960]  start with the vaccines. Here's a woman testifying at a hearing talking a 10 year old having a
[2:00:34.960 --> 2:00:42.480]  heart attack from a vaccine and how she had to with this, um, riding in the ambulance
[2:00:42.480 --> 2:00:49.560]  to the ER and clip eight. But I can tell you that two days ago, I, I flew out my first
[2:00:49.560 --> 2:00:53.560]  10 year old with a heart attack and I had to fight the doctor in the ER because he's
[2:00:53.560 --> 2:00:58.120]  like 10 year olds don't have heart attacks. And I argued back and forth for 30 minutes
[2:00:58.120 --> 2:01:04.120]  to force his hand to get an EKG to find out that he was had almost a complete STEMI, which
[2:01:04.120 --> 2:01:10.360]  is ST elevated myocardial infarction for which you could see it lit up on the 12 lead EKG.
[2:01:10.360 --> 2:01:14.000]  And he's like, well, that's not possible. And I'm like, well, he was just vaccinated
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:19.600]  yesterday. It is very much possible. At any given time, people are getting ahold of me
[2:01:19.600 --> 2:01:23.720]  and the nurse advocates at American frontline nurses to help advocate because as you've
[2:01:23.720 --> 2:01:31.280]  seen, there is a victim shaming that it does. Oh, it's anxiety. Oh, it's this. But in actuality,
[2:01:31.280 --> 2:01:36.800]  if they put down that it was a vaccine injury, the physician, the corporation, the hospital,
[2:01:36.800 --> 2:01:42.320]  the clinic, they actually won't get reimbursed. So it gets labeled as anxiety or neuropathy
[2:01:42.320 --> 2:01:48.880]  or Yanbar Ray syndrome when in actuality, it's very realistically a vaccine injury.
[2:01:48.880 --> 2:01:53.160]  Whereas I tell people you are better off in South America in a field hospital than you
[2:01:53.160 --> 2:02:00.240]  are in level one trauma designer hospitals in the United States. As nurses, we are getting
[2:02:00.240 --> 2:02:05.760]  reports across the country from our American frontline nurses about patients not getting
[2:02:05.760 --> 2:02:10.360]  food, patients not getting water. How come a patient hasn't been vetted nine days? Why
[2:02:10.360 --> 2:02:16.120]  do I need to get a court order to force a hospital to feed a person who isn't intubated and who's
[2:02:16.120 --> 2:02:21.280]  literally telling you they would like food? Oh, well, you can't take your bipap mask off.
[2:02:21.280 --> 2:02:24.200]  Well, that's what us nurses are for. We're going to help you take that off. We're going
[2:02:24.200 --> 2:02:28.160]  to help you eat, but we're not allowed to. If you know if they're on a ventilator, they're
[2:02:28.160 --> 2:02:32.080]  not getting basic standards of care. I've had patients that haven't been bathed, haven't
[2:02:32.080 --> 2:02:35.920]  been fed, haven't been given water, haven't been turned. And if you ask me, this isn't
[2:02:35.920 --> 2:02:41.320]  a hospital, this is a concentration camp. Absolutely it is.
[2:02:41.320 --> 2:02:49.400]  So they're killing us with the vaccines and let's not forget also how they're crashing
[2:02:49.400 --> 2:02:55.880]  our economy and how bad it is. Look at this news report. It's so bad in America, people
[2:02:55.880 --> 2:03:00.200]  are going to Mexico for economic relief in clip one.
[2:03:00.200 --> 2:03:05.160]  For the seventh straight month, food prices in the U.S. have gone up, which means Americans
[2:03:05.160 --> 2:03:10.120]  are looking elsewhere, like even in other countries for their favorite foods. If you're
[2:03:10.120 --> 2:03:13.840]  on a budget, you got to take care of yourself. Like Gibran Jimenez, who drove nearly two
[2:03:13.840 --> 2:03:20.480]  hours to get to Tijuana with a wife, two children in a third due next month. He says he needs
[2:03:20.480 --> 2:03:28.800]  all the financial help he can get. And we walked with David and Maria McCarty across
[2:03:28.800 --> 2:03:34.720]  the border. They came for street tacos and a routine pet checkup. It's much cheaper to
[2:03:34.720 --> 2:03:39.760]  do it down here. Everything is cheaper down in Mexico. You can go out and have a giant
[2:03:39.760 --> 2:03:44.640]  meal and spend about 20 bucks. It'll cost you 100 bucks in San Diego or to the west.
[2:03:44.640 --> 2:03:50.320]  California bargain hunters are shopping in Tijuana like never before. Shop owners at
[2:03:50.320 --> 2:03:56.160]  the popular Mercado Hidalgo have seen a 20 to 30% jump in American tourism during the
[2:03:56.160 --> 2:04:01.080]  weekdays. And when you look at the prices, it's easy to see why. A gallon of milk is
[2:04:01.080 --> 2:04:07.240]  50% off compared to the U.S. A four pack of toilet paper is nearly $5 cheaper and a 24
[2:04:07.240 --> 2:04:12.640]  pack of Tylenol is also $1 less. And don't worry about the cost to get there. You may
[2:04:12.640 --> 2:04:19.200]  as well fill up on gas because that's also $1.24 cheaper than the California average.
[2:04:19.200 --> 2:04:24.600]  Plus prices, they're going up crazy. And that's what kills us, you know, the middle class.
[2:04:24.600 --> 2:04:30.360]  Your money goes farther in Mexico. But don't worry guys. You know, the Democrats, they're
[2:04:30.360 --> 2:04:35.120]  doing great. How do you like Democrat Party rule? People having to go to Mexico. But hey,
[2:04:35.120 --> 2:04:40.760]  don't worry, the Plosys are doing just fine. Nancy Pelosi's son, who went with her to Taiwan
[2:04:40.760 --> 2:04:46.680]  as an escort, she says. Yeah, his business deals in China are going public and investing
[2:04:46.680 --> 2:04:50.720]  in Chinese tech firms and the Plosys investing in microchip companies. But hey, guys, you
[2:04:50.720 --> 2:04:53.880]  know, you're getting crushed economically by the Democrats, but don't worry, they're
[2:04:53.880 --> 2:04:58.600]  getting filthy rich.
[2:04:58.600 --> 2:05:04.120]  So many people over the years have walked up to me randomly on the street and said, Super
[2:05:04.120 --> 2:05:09.760]  male vitality is incredible. Why does it work so well? And the answer is very simple. It
[2:05:09.760 --> 2:05:15.480]  takes from Chinese medicine and other ancient traditions, known herbal compounds that boost
[2:05:15.480 --> 2:05:22.240]  libido, stamina and energy. And it comes from cold pressed herbs. So they're not boiling
[2:05:22.240 --> 2:05:28.680]  or heating up the herbs that are known to have these natural effects. It's cold pressed.
[2:05:28.680 --> 2:05:34.640]  It's been sold out for eight months or more. It's finally back in stock at infowarstore.com

[2:06:05.320 --> 2:06:13.080]  You've found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[2:06:13.080 --> 2:06:21.720]  There are huge stories developing at the southern border right now in Texas. My goodness. And
[2:06:21.720 --> 2:06:27.160]  I've got some other border news here. Oh boy. I mean, this country is just falling apart,
[2:06:27.160 --> 2:06:34.320]  folks. And Joe Biden's on vacation. So be not afraid. Elijah Schaffer joins us now, the
[2:06:34.320 --> 2:06:42.040]  host of Slightly Offensive. I mean, Elijah, it's just the news right now is so overwhelming.
[2:06:42.040 --> 2:06:46.440]  And obviously the big story that just encapsulates all of it. The Democrat Party is just fully
[2:06:46.440 --> 2:06:51.720]  corrupt. They're now totally in bed with the FBI and all the other government institutions.
[2:06:51.720 --> 2:06:56.240]  It's now a collusion operation against the American people. The American people are suffering.
[2:06:56.240 --> 2:07:01.960]  Joe Biden's on vacation. And we've got a total authoritarian totalitarian tyrannical regime
[2:07:01.960 --> 2:07:06.320]  oppressing the American people now. I think they're getting ready for something big after
[2:07:06.320 --> 2:07:10.520]  the Trump raid. I think that was just the beginning. Elijah Schaffer, your response
[2:07:10.520 --> 2:07:14.520]  to the current state of affairs in American politics right now.
[2:07:14.520 --> 2:07:19.240]  You know what? I have to say this, the words that I would use, God would not want me to
[2:07:19.240 --> 2:07:23.620]  use them. But the actions that we might have to use one day, I pray that God gives us the
[2:07:23.620 --> 2:07:28.800]  wisdom to move swiftly as we protect our family and our friends. Because you see right now,
[2:07:28.800 --> 2:07:35.000]  as we speak, the establishment media, Michael Boshless from NBC, literally giving a dog whistle
[2:07:35.000 --> 2:07:40.320]  about executing President Trump, talking about the Rosenberg saying, Hey, someone else gave
[2:07:40.320 --> 2:07:44.560]  nuclear documents, which we have not confirmed, which I don't believe is true. And the American
[2:07:44.560 --> 2:07:49.360]  public doesn't buy it. Well, they gave nuclear documents to the Russians and we executed them.
[2:07:49.360 --> 2:07:53.040]  You know, we shot them. And then he goes, hint, hint, hint, wink, wink. Do you know who
[2:07:53.040 --> 2:07:56.720]  else had nuclear documents that we're trying to give to the Russians? Well, according to
[2:07:56.720 --> 2:08:01.160]  the mainstream media and the FBI that didn't want cameras around as they raided Melania's
[2:08:01.160 --> 2:08:07.120]  panty drawers and possibly planted evidence inside of his safes. Oh, it was Donald Trump.
[2:08:07.120 --> 2:08:12.080]  The mainstream media is already hinting not this is not a, you know, Madonna. This is
[2:08:12.080 --> 2:08:19.080]  not Johnny Depp. The mainstream establishment arm of the regime is already coaxing us into
[2:08:19.080 --> 2:08:24.160]  believing that Donald Trump may deserve an execution. All while the current president
[2:08:24.160 --> 2:08:30.240]  that they say was elected is out, you know, sipping on his, uh, you know, Adderall induced
[2:08:30.240 --> 2:08:35.400]  martinis. And then you have the southern border going on, not only fentanyl, not only immigration,
[2:08:35.400 --> 2:08:40.000]  but literally cartels riding, killing people inside little Caesars, an absolute lawlessness
[2:08:40.000 --> 2:08:43.520]  abounding. And we're supposed to sit here and just go, Yeah, everything's good. Let
[2:08:43.520 --> 2:08:49.240]  me spend $10 more on my gas. Let me, let me give you five extra bucks. And you know what?
[2:08:49.240 --> 2:08:54.360]  While you're at it, send one of your 87,000 IRS agents while you're injecting my kid
[2:08:54.360 --> 2:08:59.040]  with poison. You're telling my wife to get an abortion and to kill my future generations.
[2:08:59.040 --> 2:09:02.080]  And while you're at it, take the rest of my money. And if I don't comply, why don't you
[2:09:02.080 --> 2:09:05.600]  just kill all of us? Because that's what they're threatening right now. They're threatening
[2:09:05.600 --> 2:09:10.000]  death. And then while you're on your way to it, they're threatening suffering. They're
[2:09:10.000 --> 2:09:14.800]  already persecuting us. I mean, what the hell is even going on? It's absolute madness.
[2:09:14.800 --> 2:09:18.000]  Well, and I want to get back into the IRS story because it ties into everything you
[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:23.160]  just said. But see, really the overall kind of notion that you have to this is the same
[2:09:23.160 --> 2:09:28.240]  one I have to it. I mean, I just see all this news and it's just like, God help us. I mean,
[2:09:28.240 --> 2:09:33.040]  just God help us. I mean, I see the awakening. I see the awakening inside of the Republican
[2:09:33.040 --> 2:09:38.000]  Party. I see the awakening inside even the mainstream media, some, some in the mainstream
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:43.400]  liberal media. And then obviously on Fox News, but it's like, we have to start taking serious
[2:09:43.400 --> 2:09:46.680]  swift action against the real criminals in this country that have been operating out
[2:09:46.680 --> 2:09:53.440]  of DC for decades. Or I see America getting into such a dark place, raids against American
[2:09:53.440 --> 2:09:58.120]  citizens becoming an everyday thing, execution of dissidents to the Democrat Party becoming
[2:09:58.120 --> 2:10:02.680]  a regular thing. And really just not even having elections anymore. So Democrats can
[2:10:02.680 --> 2:10:07.840]  stay in power. I mean, I really see that that's where all of this is going in America. And
[2:10:07.840 --> 2:10:13.520]  it's just like, we have to beg God, please give us a relief, please give us a path out
[2:10:13.520 --> 2:10:20.040]  of this. No, you're absolutely right. I wanted to remind people specifically from the Oklahoma
[2:10:20.040 --> 2:10:25.600]  City bombings. If you guys don't remember, there was an individual, a hero cop that lived
[2:10:25.600 --> 2:10:30.600]  during the time he was African American. And he came out after the OKC bombings and said,
[2:10:30.600 --> 2:10:35.200]  the official narrative, I just want to give a different example, meaning he saved multiple
[2:10:35.200 --> 2:10:39.280]  lives. He was getting the the Medal of Valor. And he said, Hey, I think I have a slightly
[2:10:39.280 --> 2:10:43.360]  different narrative than the FBI is giving on that. And what happened? I think it was
[2:10:43.360 --> 2:10:47.600]  about a day before he was about to receive his his Medal of Honor for actually going
[2:10:47.600 --> 2:10:54.120]  and saving lives in a tragedy. He died of suicide with a downward shot to his body cuts
[2:10:54.120 --> 2:10:59.800]  and wounds grass stuck in his wounds, handcuffs marks on his hands died in a field, a hero
[2:10:59.800 --> 2:11:06.040]  cop who questioned an official narrative is killed. And they say they died by suicide.
[2:11:06.040 --> 2:11:10.600]  These people are wicked. If they would kill a cop who saved people, I don't even care
[2:11:10.600 --> 2:11:14.240]  what the narrative was, whether the government did it, whether people did it, whether terrorists
[2:11:14.240 --> 2:11:18.800]  did it, whether the, you know, McVeigh did it. The point is, a man went and he gave his
[2:11:18.800 --> 2:11:23.760]  life risked his life to save people. And somebody was willing to take him out, go down that
[2:11:23.760 --> 2:11:27.680]  rabbit hole and think about that. If they're willing to do it to someone there. And by the
[2:11:27.680 --> 2:11:32.960]  way, being an officer, he's probably armed off duty. He has a firearm. He's able to protect
[2:11:32.960 --> 2:11:36.760]  himself to some extent. But sometimes with the state, you think about this, they have
[2:11:36.760 --> 2:11:41.600]  about what four million armed individuals about. I think we have a couple hundred million
[2:11:41.600 --> 2:11:46.760]  firearms in terms of small firearms. They've killed 20 million people, you know, maybe
[2:11:46.760 --> 2:11:50.840]  maybe six million people in the last, you know, 100 years, I guess depends how you count.
[2:11:50.840 --> 2:11:56.120]  I think American citizens and self defense have killed 250,000. Who's the real enemy?
[2:11:56.120 --> 2:12:00.600]  You have a fraction of the portion of firearms of us as the state, yet you've killed millions
[2:12:00.600 --> 2:12:04.080]  and yet we only use our guns and self defense. They're wicked. They're evil. And if they'll
[2:12:04.080 --> 2:12:08.980]  kill an officer who saved lives, they'll kill a servant of the people who was trying to
[2:12:08.980 --> 2:12:13.200]  do what's right. What makes you think they're not going to do something like that to you?
[2:12:13.200 --> 2:12:17.160]  What makes it think that you, what, you didn't pay your taxes? Well, that's not even as good
[2:12:17.160 --> 2:12:21.880]  as saving lives. I mean, and they want the IRS to be willing to kill. That's how badly
[2:12:21.880 --> 2:12:26.040]  they want your money. The love of money is the root of all kinds of evil. And I'm damn
[2:12:26.040 --> 2:12:30.280]  for sure that they are so greedy that they will take everything. And once they've squeezed
[2:12:30.280 --> 2:12:34.600]  this dry of every penny, they're coming for the breath in our lungs. No. And I think the
[2:12:34.600 --> 2:12:39.200]  only thing right now, there is only one thing in the way of that, and that is the second
[2:12:39.200 --> 2:12:40.200]  amendment.
[2:12:40.200 --> 2:12:44.040]  As soon as the Democrats get rid of the second amendment, which is a O'Rourke's campaign,
[2:12:44.040 --> 2:12:49.640]  I mean, literally his whole campaign is getting rid of guns. Once you see the Democrats actually
[2:12:49.640 --> 2:12:53.000]  fully start implementing the gun grabbing and taking all the guns, I think that's when
[2:12:53.000 --> 2:12:57.640]  we see this go into just complete tyranny, complete oppression, complete dystopia. That's
[2:12:57.640 --> 2:13:02.240]  the only thing really stopping them at a mass level I see right now. But they're already
[2:13:02.240 --> 2:13:07.680]  trying to disarm citizens. They are disarming citizens actively. The people don't even realize
[2:13:07.680 --> 2:13:11.040]  that's going on. Citizens are being disarmed every day by the federal government actually
[2:13:11.040 --> 2:13:16.800]  right now. And so I think you're right. I think that's where this goes next. And let's
[2:13:16.800 --> 2:13:22.000]  not forget how many police officers that were there on January 6 committed suicide in the
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:26.280]  months following January 6. I think it was like three or four police officers committed
[2:13:26.280 --> 2:13:29.320]  suicide, but I'm sure there's no foul play there, Elijah. We should probably just not
[2:13:29.320 --> 2:13:30.320]  even mention that.
[2:13:30.320 --> 2:13:35.280]  No, it's very normal when you are the victim of an attack and you want to get your voice
[2:13:35.280 --> 2:13:39.600]  heard. You want to tell people the truth that you would accidentally just commit suicide.
[2:13:39.600 --> 2:13:44.360]  And that's such a common theme right after these events, especially considering there
[2:13:44.360 --> 2:13:48.400]  was no mass casualties besides the people who committed suicide and the Trump supporters
[2:13:48.400 --> 2:13:52.200]  who were killed that day. Many of them talk about they died from natural causes being
[2:13:52.200 --> 2:13:57.400]  that I was there specifically at the Capitol. And I know people were pushed off of walls.
[2:13:57.400 --> 2:14:02.240]  People were trampled. I mean, this was an absolute just tragedy because it was allowed
[2:14:02.240 --> 2:14:07.040]  to happen by the federal government as well. So in any compensatory charges could be filed.
[2:14:07.040 --> 2:14:11.240]  It's like people did die because security was low and they should sue the federal government
[2:14:11.240 --> 2:14:12.240]  for that.
[2:14:12.240 --> 2:14:18.680]  But when I'm reading some of these stories, I look and I see it in Portland how they toppled
[2:14:18.680 --> 2:14:25.440]  a few years ago. They toppled the abolitionist Abraham Lincoln statue and as a sign to social
[2:14:25.440 --> 2:14:29.320]  justice in the city, the city never replaced it. And I think that's what's so important
[2:14:29.320 --> 2:14:34.280]  that people have to understand is that every time they erode one more civil liberty, every
[2:14:34.280 --> 2:14:38.800]  time they erode one more of our amendments, every time they erode one more of our God
[2:14:38.800 --> 2:14:43.320]  given rights that we have fought for, that our nation has blood for, that even my ancestors
[2:14:43.320 --> 2:14:47.920]  fought in the revolution and in the civil war, literally to free the slaves, literally
[2:14:47.920 --> 2:14:53.200]  to have independence. We walk around and we're told our history is not good enough. White
[2:14:53.200 --> 2:14:57.840]  men are evil. White men are bad. So what if 500,000 white people gave their lives for
[2:14:57.840 --> 2:15:03.400]  the freedom of slavery? So what if thousands and tens of thousands fought a war they couldn't
[2:15:03.400 --> 2:15:10.280]  win against the British? So what if many more white men and many more Americans died in
[2:15:10.280 --> 2:15:15.200]  countless wars like Vietnam where they gave their lives for seemingly nothing? It appears.
[2:15:15.200 --> 2:15:18.400]  It doesn't matter because today we're going to rewrite history. You're not going to be
[2:15:18.400 --> 2:15:21.760]  in power. It's not just white men, but no men are going to be in power. We're going
[2:15:21.760 --> 2:15:28.800]  to be a queer, LGBT, trans movement of disabled people and the men are going to be weak, emasculated.
[2:15:28.800 --> 2:15:32.680]  We're going to take your testosterone. We're going to suck it out with straws and seed oils
[2:15:32.680 --> 2:15:36.480]  and we're going to make sure that you enjoy it and you thank us as we put you in your
[2:15:36.480 --> 2:15:39.200]  grave. And anyone who resists, they're going to take us down. They're going to end our
[2:15:39.200 --> 2:15:40.680]  lives early. I'm sure of it.
[2:15:40.680 --> 2:15:44.720]  Yeah. That's where this is going and I just pray to God we can, we can, good men and
[2:15:44.720 --> 2:15:47.960]  women can rise up and stop it peacefully and politically because I mean that, that really
[2:15:47.960 --> 2:15:52.480]  is where it goes. And I mean, they even get lied to about history. They get lied to about
[2:15:52.480 --> 2:15:55.320]  history. We'll talk about that with Elijah Schaffer on the other side.
[2:15:55.320 --> 2:16:00.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, if millions of people get this book, our funding problems will be
[2:16:00.320 --> 2:16:04.400]  over and it's starting to happen. That's why I said, yeah, go to info warshore.com. Get
[2:16:04.400 --> 2:16:07.320]  the book and start shipping in a couple of weeks. The great reset in the war for the
[2:16:07.320 --> 2:16:11.920]  world. But I said, go to Amazon because it's the number one book chart in the world. And
[2:16:11.920 --> 2:16:16.040]  it goes to number one, not a political, not of history, not of US history. It's already
[2:16:16.040 --> 2:16:20.680]  number one over 40 categories like political science. You name it, 40 plus categories
[2:16:20.680 --> 2:16:27.960]  is number one. Ladies and gentlemen, drum roll, please of books in the world. The great reset
[2:16:27.960 --> 2:16:38.960]  in the war for the world is 123456789. We are now number nine in the world. This is major.
[2:16:38.960 --> 2:16:43.440]  This is political. This could fund our war chest. Just go to amazon.com everybody and
[2:16:43.440 --> 2:16:49.520]  buy 10 copies, send this blueprint to the death star and the new world order. Cause you read
[2:16:49.520 --> 2:16:52.360]  this, you know, their whole plan how to stop them, hit the great reset in the war for the

[2:16:58.240 --> 2:17:03.840]  Seven months ago in December of 2021, we launched the first and the three coin founding member
[2:17:03.840 --> 2:17:09.200]  series, George Washington slaying the dragon. Then we launched the tree of liberty coin

[2:18:57.520 --> 2:19:02.880]  The globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family to destroy heterosexual
[2:19:02.880 --> 2:19:08.040]  relationships to annihilate our marriages and the studies are all clear. The number one
[2:19:08.040 --> 2:19:14.840]  cause of marital splits is that there is problems in the bedroom and the number one issue men
[2:19:14.840 --> 2:19:20.760]  have is erectile dysfunction. Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes about this because
[2:19:20.760 --> 2:19:24.400]  they don't want people having lasting good love and relationships. They want to break

[2:19:59.000 --> 2:20:26.120]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:26.120 --> 2:20:32.480]  Elijah Schaefer is with us, host of Slightly Offensive. Elijah, I want to play a clip for
[2:20:32.480 --> 2:20:38.040]  you real quick and not give any context to it and just see what comes to your mind hearing
[2:20:38.040 --> 2:20:44.920]  this clip. Guys, let's go back. Here's Barack Obama in 2008. Elijah, listen to this clip
[2:20:44.920 --> 2:20:50.680]  and tell me what comes to mind now in the year 2022 from this Obama clip in 2008.
[2:20:50.680 --> 2:20:57.120]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives
[2:20:57.120 --> 2:21:03.400]  that we've set. We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful,
[2:21:03.400 --> 2:21:10.000]  just as strong, just as well funded. Elijah, your response.
[2:21:10.000 --> 2:21:14.480]  I would say this, besides the funding part, I would have originally said, yeah, we should
[2:21:14.480 --> 2:21:20.840]  have a civilian force. And then the funding, okay, so this is not a self-funded. This is
[2:21:20.840 --> 2:21:27.520]  not a well-regulated militia in terms of our Second Amendment. So who's funding the civilian
[2:21:27.520 --> 2:21:33.200]  force? And is that a force of us who are fighting for our own protection of our homes? Or is
[2:21:33.200 --> 2:21:38.040]  that a force that is coming to watch us, to spy on us, to try to make sure that we're
[2:21:38.040 --> 2:21:42.080]  falling in line? And I think we've already begun to see this with the development of
[2:21:42.080 --> 2:21:46.880]  the Department of Homeland Security. When they say at the airport, if you see something,
[2:21:46.880 --> 2:21:51.960]  say something, please report any suspicious activity. And that's scary to me because right
[2:21:51.960 --> 2:21:56.640]  now the suspicious activity is a left bag, which already seems quite odd. You'd assume
[2:21:56.640 --> 2:22:01.880]  someone would put their backpack down that they're going to blow you up. That's a fear-mongering
[2:22:01.880 --> 2:22:07.680]  communist rhetoric to divide people and make us fear our neighbor. But also, who is it?
[2:22:07.680 --> 2:22:11.280]  And where is the money coming from? I think I have an idea. And we're already seeing a
[2:22:11.280 --> 2:22:16.760]  Mar-a-Lago being raided a private home of an ex-president. I bet I have an idea of who
[2:22:16.760 --> 2:22:17.760]  that could be.
[2:22:17.760 --> 2:22:23.760]  And now, I mean, I just see the IRS about to hire 87,000 agents that are being trained
[2:22:23.760 --> 2:22:27.600]  to use deadly force against American citizens. And I just can't help but think, wow, what
[2:22:27.600 --> 2:22:34.120]  a perfect time for the government expansion during the Patriot Purge to bring in 87,000
[2:22:34.120 --> 2:22:40.280]  neoliberal radical communist leftists that get sexually aroused at the idea of carrying
[2:22:40.280 --> 2:22:43.560]  a badge around and a gun to go kill their political opposition.
[2:22:43.560 --> 2:22:48.360]  Yeah, they're lesbians. They're going to be ugly. They're going to be fat. They're
[2:22:48.360 --> 2:22:52.520]  going to be gender confused. They're going to have chopped off their genitals. Their
[2:22:52.520 --> 2:22:59.200]  IQs are going to be lower than your grandparents' age. They're going to be quadruple-boosted,
[2:22:59.200 --> 2:23:04.420]  coming from the most prestigious and also some of the dumbest colleges alike, with only
[2:23:04.420 --> 2:23:10.240]  one goal in mind, that their loyalty is to the regime, that they do not think for themselves
[2:23:10.240 --> 2:23:13.680]  and that they'd be willing to sacrifice anything except for their own lives.
[2:23:13.680 --> 2:23:17.880]  I'm talking about your life, right? My life. They're willing to sacrifice our lives to
[2:23:17.880 --> 2:23:23.880]  use deadly force. And these people are strapped. I mean, I made an episode of Slightly Offensive,
[2:23:23.880 --> 2:23:29.120]  my podcast that was out today at two o'clock. And I'm telling you, Kerry Lake, future governor
[2:23:29.120 --> 2:23:33.160]  of Arizona, was talking. The federal government has gotten out of control and they are coming
[2:23:33.160 --> 2:23:37.720]  for us and they will come for you. They will raid your home and we've got to be careful.
[2:23:37.720 --> 2:23:44.640]  We don't want the global homo-quasi, mixed diversity, racially ambiguous, obese IRS agent
[2:23:44.640 --> 2:23:48.560]  army knocking down your door. You've got to do something. You've got to start calling
[2:23:48.560 --> 2:23:52.280]  your congressmen. You've got to call your senators. You've got to call your local politicians.
[2:23:52.280 --> 2:23:57.080]  We've got to mobilize at a state level. We need protections in the boundaries of our
[2:23:57.080 --> 2:24:01.440]  federalist system. We need that to return or else it's going to be too late. By the
[2:24:01.440 --> 2:24:06.080]  time you pick up your phone to call, you're like, hello? It's like, well, who's on the
[2:24:06.080 --> 2:24:09.600]  other line? You hear a knock at your door? It's the IRS agents and they're going to take
[2:24:09.600 --> 2:24:12.760]  your family. They're going to take your things. And if you can't pay up, they're going to
[2:24:12.760 --> 2:24:14.080]  take your life.
[2:24:14.080 --> 2:24:19.120]  Oh, my gosh. It's just, it's so crazy to think that they're doing this right in front of
[2:24:19.120 --> 2:24:24.560]  us, especially considering that the left wing ideology, you think we'd learn from history
[2:24:24.560 --> 2:24:30.240]  here, Elijah, but we don't. The left wing ideology is the most blood drenched, deadly
[2:24:30.240 --> 2:24:35.560]  ideology out of the 20th century. Mao Zedong, the communist, killed at least 100 million.
[2:24:35.560 --> 2:24:39.520]  Adolf Hitler, the socialist, killed, I think they say 70 million. I don't know the numbers
[2:24:39.520 --> 2:24:43.520]  in front of me, but it's well known. Left wing ideology, socialism, communism is the
[2:24:43.520 --> 2:24:48.520]  deadliest ideology in the history of this planet, aside from just straight up death
[2:24:48.520 --> 2:24:52.840]  cults, but left wing ideology is the closest thing to a death cult if it isn't to begin
[2:24:52.840 --> 2:25:00.200]  with. And I always ask myself this, how many people have to die for the left wing ideology
[2:25:00.200 --> 2:25:05.840]  to be complete? How many people have to die? We know the answer. 100 million in China, 70
[2:25:05.840 --> 2:25:10.520]  million in the National Socialist Party of Germany. So, literally, if the left wing
[2:25:10.520 --> 2:25:14.400]  wants to actually complete their ideology, they're going to have to kill millions or
[2:25:14.400 --> 2:25:18.680]  even billions of people. I say we don't let them. Let's stick to freedom. Let's learn
[2:25:18.680 --> 2:25:25.360]  from history. Left wing ideology ends in blood and death and murder and devastation. Let's
[2:25:25.360 --> 2:25:29.720]  learn from the 20th century and eradicate this from the 21st century before they kill
[2:25:29.720 --> 2:25:33.200]  hundreds of millions again. No, you're right. And they started with
[2:25:33.200 --> 2:25:39.360]  the torturing already. And the weirdest part about the modern left socialist genocide
[2:25:39.360 --> 2:25:45.720]  is that just like public shaming, which we saw begin staunchly in the 2015, 2016 area
[2:25:45.720 --> 2:25:49.800]  and we saw free speech completely eradicated where you can lose your job from this gendering
[2:25:49.800 --> 2:25:55.000]  someone using the wrong pronouns. You know, as I always say, I don't care about your pronouns.
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:25:59.320]  I don't even care about your name. You're a narcissist, but they want you to care.
[2:25:59.320 --> 2:26:03.080]  And then here's the best part. Now they're having you mutilate your own children and
[2:26:03.080 --> 2:26:06.400]  thinking that you're liberating them. That was that a Boston Children's Hospital, you
[2:26:06.400 --> 2:26:10.800]  guys probably talked about it, that was offering hysterectomies to minors. And they want you
[2:26:10.800 --> 2:26:15.680]  to abuse and mutilate your kids. And the best part that I can't understand is you feel like
[2:26:15.680 --> 2:26:20.320]  a good person while you do their bidding to your own family. But a lot of people are waking
[2:26:20.320 --> 2:26:25.120]  up, Owen. A lot of people are realizing, I don't want to chop my kids penis off. I don't
[2:26:25.120 --> 2:26:29.680]  want my daughters, you know, breast to be moved to mastectomies. I don't want to drink
[2:26:29.680 --> 2:26:35.040]  the poison. I'm not going to eat your cricket chips. I don't want this BS way of living.
[2:26:35.040 --> 2:26:39.360]  And so you know what happens as the resistance grows, everyone celebrates on Twitter. Oh,
[2:26:39.360 --> 2:26:45.080]  the narrative is collapsing. There's a red wave coming in 2022. We're finally winning.
[2:26:45.080 --> 2:26:50.200]  Oh, we're going to be so mad about the raid on Trump's Mar-a-Lago. I'll tell you this.
[2:26:50.200 --> 2:26:54.680]  You're not the only one paying attention that their information warfare is losing. You're
[2:26:54.680 --> 2:26:59.640]  not the only one who knows that the grip on warfare is falling apart. They know. And when
[2:26:59.640 --> 2:27:03.120]  they can't convince you anymore to hurt your own children, when they lose the right to
[2:27:03.120 --> 2:27:08.160]  kill their own, your own baby, and they've stopped convincing you that abortion is healthcare,
[2:27:08.160 --> 2:27:11.760]  when they've lost the ability to genocide through your own hands, what will they do?
[2:27:11.760 --> 2:27:15.320]  When they can't get through your hands, they'll take away your arms specifically, your right
[2:27:15.320 --> 2:27:19.600]  to bare arms, and then they will come and they will do the killing, the death and the
[2:27:19.600 --> 2:27:23.400]  mutilation themselves. This is the greatest bait and switch you've ever seen. And as we
[2:27:23.400 --> 2:27:27.800]  think we've gained ground on the Supreme Court, believe me, watch yourself. Make sure that
[2:27:27.800 --> 2:27:31.800]  you're armed. Make sure that you apply your patriotic skills. Make sure you understand
[2:27:31.800 --> 2:27:36.240]  what God has called you to always seek the peace, but be prepared for an attack. Always
[2:27:36.240 --> 2:27:40.820]  be on the defense and realize what could always come like a bear attacking in the night. Never
[2:27:40.820 --> 2:27:43.320]  underestimate your enemy.
[2:27:43.320 --> 2:27:47.520]  And I want to talk about the awakening when we come back in the next segment, but I just
[2:27:47.520 --> 2:27:52.360]  want to kind of put this down. We were talking about this in the last segment. It's frustrating.
[2:27:52.360 --> 2:27:56.360]  You know, liberals, they don't know anything, including their own history. And so we have
[2:27:56.360 --> 2:28:00.240]  this big argument about why America needs to go down because it's racist. And it's so
[2:28:00.240 --> 2:28:03.880]  sick, it's so sickening that you have to teach these people history every day to get them
[2:28:03.880 --> 2:28:08.520]  to understand the truth. I mean, they say, look how racist America is. It had slaves.
[2:28:08.520 --> 2:28:12.360]  Oh, forget about the world history of slavery. I mean, you know, they goes well beyond America.
[2:28:12.360 --> 2:28:16.560]  We actually ended slavery and set that precedent for the world. But it's like, you hear it
[2:28:16.560 --> 2:28:22.960]  all the time. Oh, it's racist. Oh, they own slaves. Folks, 25% of Americans in the South
[2:28:22.960 --> 2:28:30.840]  own slaves, 25%. It was less than 10% in the entire country in the years before we abolish
[2:28:30.840 --> 2:28:35.680]  slavery, less than 10% of Americans. And just to add a little cherry on top, black men own
[2:28:35.680 --> 2:28:41.280]  slaves to freed black men owned black slaves. But see, they don't teach you that in the
[2:28:41.280 --> 2:28:45.520]  history books because they got to teach you that America is racist. And therefore America
[2:28:45.520 --> 2:28:51.520]  needs to be shut down. No, it's not America that makes America great. It's freedom that
[2:28:51.520 --> 2:28:54.640]  makes America great. That's why they have to destroy America because they have to take
[2:28:54.640 --> 2:28:57.080]  your freedom.
[2:28:57.080 --> 2:29:02.560]  So many people over the years have walked up to me randomly on the street and said, Super
[2:29:02.560 --> 2:29:08.240]  male vitality is incredible. Why does it work so well? And the answer is very simple. It
[2:29:08.240 --> 2:29:13.960]  takes from Chinese medicine and other ancient traditions, known herbal compounds that boost
[2:29:13.960 --> 2:29:20.720]  libido, stamina and energy. And it comes from cold pressed herbs. So they're not boiling
[2:29:20.720 --> 2:29:27.200]  or heating up the herbs that are known to have these natural effects. It's cold pressed.
[2:29:27.200 --> 2:29:33.160]  It's been sold out for eight months or more. It's finally back in stock at infowarstore.com
[2:29:33.160 --> 2:29:40.720]  for 25% off Super male vitality. And it goes great with X2, which is also 25% off. But

[2:29:56.880 --> 2:30:03.040]  We are now living in the void, sliding towards collapse in the strange space between what
[2:30:03.040 --> 2:30:08.480]  we've known and what's to come. And right now, the most important thing to remember
[2:30:08.480 --> 2:30:14.800]  is don't panic. Stay calm, because now is the time that we must get our bearings and
[2:30:14.800 --> 2:30:21.240]  steer the ship onto a safe sound course. There is nothing stopping we, the people, from making
[2:30:21.240 --> 2:30:27.800]  our own rules and building our own society. All we got to do is survive the crash. And
[2:30:27.800 --> 2:30:33.600]  right now, we still have time to prepare. The world fiat currency system is racing
[2:30:33.600 --> 2:30:40.200]  towards zero. It's time to convert it into hard assets now, including food, water and
[2:30:40.200 --> 2:30:47.880]  survival gear to keep us strong and at the ready. Go to preparedtoday.com for the essentials,
[2:30:47.880 --> 2:30:57.400]  storable foods, water filtration, first aid, power and more at preparedtoday.com.
[2:30:57.400 --> 2:31:01.480]  The great reset in the war for the world is the book that the government doesn't want
[2:31:01.480 --> 2:31:06.520]  you to read that most of the big, powerful companies trying to control your life, the
[2:31:06.520 --> 2:31:11.240]  big tech companies, they don't want you to read this book. They want to control what
[2:31:11.240 --> 2:31:15.960]  you think, what you do, what you read, but you don't want that. And Alex Jones doesn't
[2:31:15.960 --> 2:31:21.000]  want that. And this book shows you what's happening and gives you the sort of playbook
[2:31:21.000 --> 2:31:26.000]  for how to fight against it. And so by buying this book, you're going to prove that censorship
[2:31:26.000 --> 2:31:31.480]  doesn't work, that freedom is alive in this country. This is essential reading. And you
[2:31:31.480 --> 2:31:36.280]  know, I would go right now and buy it before the censorship kicks in. It's not going to
[2:31:36.280 --> 2:31:40.360]  be available in bookstores. It's not going to be available in libraries. They're going
[2:31:40.360 --> 2:31:44.480]  to try to take it down from every platform that they can, but they're not going to be
[2:31:44.480 --> 2:31:49.720]  able to do it, prove that censorship doesn't work by the great reset. Thank you, Alex Jones.
[2:31:49.720 --> 2:31:54.040]  I really appreciate you having me on and I appreciate you writing this book and getting
[2:31:54.040 --> 2:31:56.880]  the information out there.
[2:31:56.880 --> 2:32:01.920]  We brought the game changing product previously only available to major oil companies around
[2:32:01.920 --> 2:32:07.040]  the world to the civilian market two years ago, the bio pros for septic tanks for porta
[2:32:07.040 --> 2:32:12.440]  potties for RVs for your drains, your boats, it goes on and on. It'll eat the oil off of
[2:32:12.440 --> 2:32:17.280]  your driveway. If you just add water, but it's been so successful. Now we're selling
[2:32:17.280 --> 2:32:24.600]  it to major RV parks, pig farms, you name it, because this stuff will eat anything that
[2:32:24.600 --> 2:32:32.360]  is organic and it's exclusively available at the bio pros.com. And now info or store.com.
[2:32:32.360 --> 2:32:38.400]  We sold out of this for almost a year, but we made a major purchase and it is now in stock
[2:32:38.400 --> 2:32:43.040]  for whatever your need is at info or store.com. They'll also find instructional videos and
[2:32:43.040 --> 2:32:50.400]  more information at info or store.com or the bio pros.com made America powered by God's
[2:32:50.400 --> 2:33:00.560]  great creation. It is amazing and it funds the info or leading a frontal assault on the
[2:33:00.560 --> 2:33:14.080]  lives of the new world order. It's Alex Jones. Big brother mainstream media government coverup.
[2:33:14.080 --> 2:33:22.040]  You want to stop tyranny? So does he live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[2:33:22.040 --> 2:33:29.440]  It's a motor on. And here's a flashback from early February of this year, just weeks before
[2:33:29.440 --> 2:33:36.880]  the Russians did officially begin their police action into areas of eastern Ukraine and southern
[2:33:36.880 --> 2:33:40.480]  Ukraine. Now I had said back in October of last year that the Russians were going to
[2:33:40.480 --> 2:33:48.080]  invade sometime by the end of February, because that's when the frozen tundra basically starts
[2:33:48.080 --> 2:33:52.520]  turning into liquid mud that the tanks can't go through. And it was clear that the Russians
[2:33:52.520 --> 2:33:58.200]  after NATO, starting the war eight years ago, we're tired of being pushed around and we're
[2:33:58.200 --> 2:34:02.600]  going to strike back. I don't support what the U.S. and George Soros are doing. I didn't
[2:34:02.600 --> 2:34:06.880]  support what Putin's doing. I think this is all a terrible idea. Look what's under energy
[2:34:06.880 --> 2:34:11.360]  prices in Europe. Look how they've used this as an excuse for the very recent here in America.
[2:34:11.360 --> 2:34:15.360]  This is a bad deal. But regardless, we were right tomorrow as new as today. But I want
[2:34:15.360 --> 2:34:20.800]  to play this clip from the former CIA operative and spokesperson for the State Department
[2:34:20.800 --> 2:34:24.400]  telling the truth and saying, no, we have intel. They're massing troops. They're shipping
[2:34:24.400 --> 2:34:29.880]  up blood for their troops that have been injured. We know this invasion is about to happen.
[2:34:29.880 --> 2:34:35.760]  And we believe Putin will state some provocations on some of the towns on the Russian border
[2:34:35.760 --> 2:34:42.560]  with Ukraine as a pretext to come in. And right on time, those pretexts happened. Now
[2:34:42.560 --> 2:34:48.280]  the story here and the moral of the story is that major governments when they invade
[2:34:48.280 --> 2:34:55.080]  countries have always staged provocations. It came out on the eve of the 2003 Iraq invasion
[2:34:55.080 --> 2:35:00.320]  that Bush wanted to shoot down a fake U.N. aircraft, but generals told him don't do it,
[2:35:00.320 --> 2:35:05.160]  but they did stage some other provocations. In 1991, the war started in 1990, saying that
[2:35:05.160 --> 2:35:09.640]  Saddam was bashing the brains out of baby's heads in incubators in Kuwait. None of that
[2:35:09.640 --> 2:35:14.080]  was true. To get into Vietnam, we had the Gulf of Tonkin in 1964, where they sent our
[2:35:14.080 --> 2:35:19.360]  ships were attacked. Declassified in 2004, it was totally staged. Operation Northwoods,
[2:35:19.360 --> 2:35:25.160]  all these things are admitted cases of planning the stage false flags or have crisis actors
[2:35:25.160 --> 2:35:29.440]  and the whole thing's completely staged, or you can actually attack somebody and just
[2:35:29.440 --> 2:35:35.640]  blame it on your enemy. And so we were vindicated yet again when they said, oh, it's Alex Jones
[2:35:35.640 --> 2:35:42.600]  territory for the CIA and the State Department to say Russia may stage attacks on itself
[2:35:42.600 --> 2:35:47.360]  as a pretext to invade. We see them massing and we've got intel they're planning this.
[2:35:47.360 --> 2:35:51.920]  And there were some events, truck bombs, some targeted assassinations of things that looked
[2:35:51.920 --> 2:35:57.440]  like it wasn't NATO, but Russia as a pretext. Because let's be clear, the Russians aren't
[2:35:57.440 --> 2:36:02.240]  choir boys either. The bottom line is you've always got to look at something low level
[2:36:02.240 --> 2:36:07.120]  like Jesse Smollett or Bubba Wallace and say is that staged, which it was. And it's something
[2:36:07.120 --> 2:36:11.840]  high level where big powerful forces stand to gain. Is that staged? And the answer is
[2:36:11.840 --> 2:36:17.200]  yes. Many times the groups that stand to gain are the ones that actually staged it. But
[2:36:17.200 --> 2:36:22.680]  we're sued, they believe, into oblivion for questioning Sandy Hook many, many years ago.
[2:36:22.680 --> 2:36:26.920]  Later saying we thought it happened, the media blew it up to be my whole personality. Then
[2:36:26.920 --> 2:36:30.840]  they have a show trial where the judge says I'm already guilty. So they can quote, try
[2:36:30.840 --> 2:36:35.400]  to shut us down. They said the goal is to shut him down. And anybody else asking questions
[2:36:35.400 --> 2:36:38.960]  and the judge right out of the ministry of truth. And actually he forced said, you think
[2:36:38.960 --> 2:36:42.040]  you tell the truth, you think you're telling the truth, but you don't. The truth comes
[2:36:42.040 --> 2:36:46.600]  from me. Well, no, it doesn't come from you and your black robe up to like a fat little
[2:36:46.600 --> 2:36:51.680]  vampire bat. And you're doing what tyrants always do is they lose control, you're squeezing
[2:36:51.680 --> 2:36:56.680]  and that will only accelerate the fall of the corrupt interest that have hijacked our nation.
[2:36:56.680 --> 2:37:00.640]  Here's the clip from just six months ago. And then we're going to go right back to the
[2:37:00.640 --> 2:37:03.640]  live broadcast. But this is historic.
[2:37:03.640 --> 2:37:08.680]  We told you a few weeks ago that we have information indicating Russia also has already
[2:37:08.680 --> 2:37:13.520]  prepositioned a group of operatives to conduct a false flag operation in eastern Ukraine.
[2:37:13.520 --> 2:37:17.560]  So that map to your question is an action that Russia has already taken. It's an action
[2:37:17.560 --> 2:37:24.480]  that you say that they have taken, but you have shown no evidence to confirm that. And
[2:37:24.480 --> 2:37:28.400]  I'm going to get to the next question here, which is, what is the evidence that they,
[2:37:28.400 --> 2:37:33.080]  I mean, this is like crisis actors, really. This is like Alex Jones territory you're
[2:37:33.080 --> 2:37:39.520]  getting into them. What evidence do you have to support the idea that there is some propaganda
[2:37:39.520 --> 2:37:41.840]  film in the in in the making?
[2:37:41.840 --> 2:37:47.040]  Now, this is derived from information known to the US government intelligence information
[2:37:47.040 --> 2:37:51.240]  that we have declassified. I think you know, okay, well, where, where is it? Where, where
[2:37:51.240 --> 2:37:52.240]  is this information?
[2:37:52.240 --> 2:37:54.800]  It is intelligence information that we have declassified.
[2:37:54.800 --> 2:37:57.600]  Well, where is it? Where's the declassified information?
[2:37:57.600 --> 2:37:59.240]  I just delivered it.
[2:37:59.240 --> 2:38:04.520]  No, you made a series of allegations. Would you would you like us to print out the topper
[2:38:04.520 --> 2:38:08.000]  because you will see a transcript of this briefing that you can print out for yourself?
[2:38:08.000 --> 2:38:14.040]  It's not evidence, Ned. That's you saying it. That's not evidence. I'm sorry.
[2:38:14.040 --> 2:38:15.440]  What would you like, Matt?
[2:38:15.440 --> 2:38:22.480]  I would like to see some proof that you that that that that that you can show that that
[2:38:22.480 --> 2:38:26.560]  Matt, you have been that shows that that shows that the Russians are doing that. Ned, I've
[2:38:26.560 --> 2:38:31.120]  been doing this for a long time as you know, you have been doing this for quite a while.
[2:38:31.120 --> 2:38:37.160]  You know that when we declassify intelligence information, we do so in a means we do so.
[2:38:37.160 --> 2:38:38.160]  We do so.
[2:38:38.160 --> 2:38:43.200]  And I remember to protecting houses and methods is not going to fall. I remember a lot of things.
[2:38:43.200 --> 2:38:49.400]  So where is the declassified information other than you coming out here and saying, Matt,
[2:38:49.400 --> 2:38:53.800]  I'm sorry you don't like the format, but we have declassified format is the content.
[2:38:53.800 --> 2:38:58.320]  I'm sorry you don't like the content. I'm sorry you I'm sorry you are doubting the information
[2:38:58.320 --> 2:39:02.800]  that is in the possession of the U.S. government. What I'm telling you is that this is information
[2:39:02.800 --> 2:39:08.440]  that's available to us. We are making it available to you in order for a couple reasons. One
[2:39:08.440 --> 2:39:13.120]  is to attempt to deter the Russians from going ahead with this activity. Two, in the event
[2:39:13.120 --> 2:39:17.440]  we're not able to do that in the event the Russians do go ahead with this to make it
[2:39:17.440 --> 2:39:22.080]  clear as day to lay bare the fact that this has always been an attempt on the part of
[2:39:22.080 --> 2:39:25.000]  the Russian Federation to fabricate a pretext.
[2:39:25.000 --> 2:39:29.040]  They want you to forget about things like this. They don't want you to ever question
[2:39:29.040 --> 2:39:33.320]  the official narrative, but even if you're wrong questioning an official narrative, it's
[2:39:33.320 --> 2:39:38.360]  your right to do it. But all these attacks on free speech are about making the general
[2:39:38.360 --> 2:39:43.200]  public be afraid to question the official story because in all the major polls, mainstream
[2:39:43.200 --> 2:39:48.800]  media has the lowest poll numbers in its history below 10%. So we're going to go back to the
[2:39:48.800 --> 2:39:53.480]  live broadcast right now, but I hope you will share this video. It will also be posted at
[2:39:53.480 --> 2:39:58.200]  May I'm Not a Video because it's very historic and it's very important.
[2:39:58.200 --> 2:40:02.240]  And the biggest victory for free speech right now is InfoWars on Air every day. That's the
[2:40:02.240 --> 2:40:06.840]  biggest victory we can have for free speech. They want us off air. They thought we'd be
[2:40:06.840 --> 2:40:11.760]  off air by now. We're not. Thanks to your support at InfoWarsStore.com and your prayers.
[2:40:11.760 --> 2:40:17.360]  So please keep that up. Elijah Schaffer is still with us from Slightly Offensive. Elijah,
[2:40:17.360 --> 2:40:20.760]  I want to get into the awakening that we're seeing right now, but I want to do that in
[2:40:20.760 --> 2:40:24.720]  the next segment. We have some more time in this short 2 and a half minutes we have left.
[2:40:24.720 --> 2:40:30.400]  You know, the border situation is in the illegal immigrant situation is really just completely
[2:40:30.400 --> 2:40:36.360]  on another level now. It's turned into a ping-pong match. Washington, D.C. Mayor, asks U.S. military
[2:40:36.360 --> 2:40:40.080]  for 90 days of help with illegal immigrants. So they want the military to help the Democrat
[2:40:40.080 --> 2:40:43.720]  cities with illegal immigrants, but not stop them at the southern border. Now, New York
[2:40:43.720 --> 2:40:47.400]  is threatening to bust them back to Texas. So we're just going to be busing them all
[2:40:47.400 --> 2:40:52.320]  around the country. Why not just bust them back to wherever they came from? Governor
[2:40:52.320 --> 2:40:56.800]  Abbott dares New York City Mayor to make my day following threats to bust New Yorkers to
[2:40:56.800 --> 2:41:01.560]  Texas to campaign against him. I mean, is this not one of the weirdest things? The border
[2:41:01.560 --> 2:41:04.880]  is wide open. The Democrats say they have a sanctuary city, but they don't want the
[2:41:04.880 --> 2:41:09.600]  illegal immigrants in it. They're going to send them back to Texas. Hello. Let's just
[2:41:09.600 --> 2:41:14.760]  not let them in to begin with. Why is that not an option here? It's not an option, Owen,
[2:41:14.760 --> 2:41:19.760]  because you know what I know is that they don't want illegal immigrants in blue cities
[2:41:19.760 --> 2:41:23.960]  because it doesn't change the vote long-term, right? It's not really a big deal. The whole
[2:41:23.960 --> 2:41:27.440]  point people don't understand is it's not about hating brown people because the border
[2:41:27.440 --> 2:41:32.080]  is so diverse. You have a lot of Haitians. You have a lot of people from Central, South
[2:41:32.080 --> 2:41:36.360]  America, a lot of Asians, a lot of Chinese people. People forget that about 75% of Asians
[2:41:36.360 --> 2:41:41.400]  in America live somewhere in the West Coast area, California, et cetera. There's a lot
[2:41:41.400 --> 2:41:45.840]  of people coming up that are trying to get in and they need these people to get bust
[2:41:45.840 --> 2:41:50.520]  into middle America. It's a huge problem for them because these states are so red. They're
[2:41:50.520 --> 2:41:55.160]  so strong and they can't handle it. They can't handle us just living in peace. They don't
[2:41:55.160 --> 2:41:59.600]  want to leave us alone. The whole goal is, well, let's just bust a bunch of people. Let's
[2:41:59.600 --> 2:42:04.600]  let a bunch of people into these countries, into our country and into the states so that
[2:42:04.600 --> 2:42:07.920]  eventually long-term, they're playing a long game. It's not because they're illegal and
[2:42:07.920 --> 2:42:10.120]  they're going to vote in Texas today. It's because they're going to have kids because
[2:42:10.120 --> 2:42:15.880]  of our anchor baby laws. The sanctuary city laws are only meant to attract people. They
[2:42:15.880 --> 2:42:20.680]  have these difficult to reach cities on the coast, on the east and north, like Portland
[2:42:20.680 --> 2:42:25.640]  and Seattle and DC. Then they go, come, we're a sanctuary city. Then they just get stuck
[2:42:25.640 --> 2:42:29.360]  in these red states in the middle and the south exactly where they want them. If they
[2:42:29.360 --> 2:42:33.400]  don't get stuck, they like to fly them into the states. Within 30 years, there'll be a
[2:42:33.400 --> 2:42:36.400]  different voting block and they can have totalitarian control.
[2:42:36.400 --> 2:42:41.320]  Absolutely, 100%. That's Elijah Schaefer, host of Slightly Offensive. He's going to be sticking
[2:42:41.320 --> 2:42:45.000]  around with us for the next segment. Folks, in this short break, please, this four-minute
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:49.560]  break, go to infowarstore.com. Make a purchase at the store. Make a donation. Let's keep

[2:44:00.040 --> 2:44:04.640]  pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer, or a millionaire. Fortune
[2:44:04.640 --> 2:44:09.920]  and Money Magazine have all done these profiles. You see it every year. 30 different tax returns,
[2:44:09.920 --> 2:44:15.080]  30 different answers. 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers. And almost all of them
[2:44:15.080 --> 2:44:20.080]  just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups, because they're part
[2:44:20.080 --> 2:44:23.920]  of the system and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this.
[2:44:23.920 --> 2:44:29.680]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody.
[2:44:29.680 --> 2:44:34.880]  To be able to do things tax-wise, it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more your
[2:44:34.880 --> 2:44:40.600]  money. We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[2:44:40.600 --> 2:44:47.760]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com, one word, jonestaxrelief.com

[2:45:17.760 --> 2:45:21.520]  Push them out in the open and they are so upset and they are so scared. So while you

[2:45:52.800 --> 2:45:57.040]  joining us. I'll spread the word, my friends. We're involved in an epic historic battle.
[2:45:57.040 --> 2:46:01.760]  People say Alex Jones is crazy. He's a conspiracy theory guy. He's a nutcase. He's got these
[2:46:01.760 --> 2:46:08.840]  rants and all that. What they miss is that this guy's a head of the curve on so many
[2:46:08.840 --> 2:46:15.480]  different topics of signal, not noise. If you look at the signal and you compare that
[2:46:15.480 --> 2:46:21.840]  to PBS and NPR and BBC and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there versus what your collective
[2:46:21.840 --> 2:46:26.200]  body has put out there. And if you're a set in a human being and just watching it, you
[2:46:26.200 --> 2:46:29.560]  say, well, Alex Jones is the head of this. Not only that, he kind of explained it. You
[2:46:29.560 --> 2:46:34.440]  are one of the great thinkers of this. That is very rare. You got to go back almost to
[2:46:34.440 --> 2:46:39.600]  the revolutionary generation and see that in this new book. I got to tell you when Tony
[2:46:39.600 --> 2:46:44.720]  Lyons first approached me, I read this thing. I go, this is it. This is no Beatrix. You're
[2:46:44.720 --> 2:46:47.400]  not going to be flipping pages. You're going to be having a pin out. You're going to be
[2:46:47.400 --> 2:46:58.160]  underlining stuff. Great reset by Alex Jones. Order your copy now at Amazon or infowarstore.com.
[2:46:58.160 --> 2:47:05.800]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[2:47:05.800 --> 2:47:25.680]  So CNN's Oliver Darcy, who actively gets info wars censored off the Internet, he admits
[2:47:25.680 --> 2:47:31.760]  we're right. Amazing stuff. Oliver, Oliver, by the way, do you really want to live in
[2:47:31.760 --> 2:47:37.200]  a corrupt country? Do you really want to live in a dystopian oppressive government regime
[2:47:37.200 --> 2:47:41.680]  country, Oliver? Come on, man, because that's what you're fighting for here. But hey, he
[2:47:41.680 --> 2:47:46.600]  admits I'm right here. Oliver Darcy says, here's a sentence I never thought I'd ever
[2:47:46.600 --> 2:47:51.560]  write info wars host Owen Schreuer is spot on, at least in regard to what he said about
[2:47:51.560 --> 2:47:56.520]  Fox News on Thursday, saying Fox News sounds like more like info wars than ever before.
[2:47:56.520 --> 2:48:01.960]  Oliver, let me give you a little update here, though, buddy. I'm not just right about that.
[2:48:01.960 --> 2:48:07.040]  We're right about everything. We were right about Epstein and his pedophile island. We
[2:48:07.040 --> 2:48:10.360]  were right that there was no Trump Russia collusion. We were right that Trump would
[2:48:10.360 --> 2:48:15.080]  win the election. We were right that your two impeachment scams of Trump would go nowhere.
[2:48:15.080 --> 2:48:20.200]  We were right that if Biden got into office, energy prices, gas prices would skyrocket.
[2:48:20.200 --> 2:48:24.000]  I mean, I'm just beginning. I guess I could go on, but I'll just stop right there. We
[2:48:24.000 --> 2:48:27.640]  were right about everything. However, not just this, but it's funny. You still tune
[2:48:27.640 --> 2:48:33.080]  in every day, even though you want us off the air. So it brings me to this though, Elijah.
[2:48:33.080 --> 2:48:37.560]  There's obviously a great awakening happening right now. Milk Toast conservatives, middle
[2:48:37.560 --> 2:48:42.240]  line Republicans, conservative ink. Everybody realize, okay, wait a second, we need to have
[2:48:42.240 --> 2:48:46.720]  a sense of urgency here. Alex Jones and info wars have been right all these years. Elijah
[2:48:46.720 --> 2:48:52.000]  Schaefer has been right. All these people that we considered out there and far right.
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:54.720]  And we don't really want to bring them into the conservative movement because they're
[2:48:54.720 --> 2:48:59.240]  too out there for us. Oh, it turns out we were right all along. The sense of urgency
[2:48:59.240 --> 2:49:06.440]  is catching up. Where do you see this awakening at right now when it comes to conservatives,
[2:49:06.440 --> 2:49:08.640]  Republicans and Trump voters?
[2:49:08.640 --> 2:49:14.080]  Well, that's a good question. Number one, I just want to say with Oliver Darcy, you
[2:49:14.080 --> 2:49:17.800]  know, I think he's actually from blaze TV. I think he switched sides. He did. He tried
[2:49:17.800 --> 2:49:22.000]  to get a job here. He actually used to have a website called left wing watch or far left
[2:49:22.000 --> 2:49:26.760]  watch before he joined CNN. So he's fake. And by the way, one of our one of our old employees
[2:49:26.760 --> 2:49:29.960]  as well now works for media matters, which I don't think I'm a lot of, you know, talk
[2:49:29.960 --> 2:49:34.200]  directly. And they write hit pieces about me, one of our recent employees left and
[2:49:34.200 --> 2:49:41.000]  now now works for media matters and and craps on me. So it's so funny. So you hated us enough.
[2:49:41.000 --> 2:49:44.480]  You would spy on us that you would want to work with us, or maybe you really believed
[2:49:44.480 --> 2:49:48.920]  it, but then you got taken down. Why? Because you weren't accepted by the truth tellers
[2:49:48.920 --> 2:49:53.680]  because you weren't a real one. Real knows real. And these people are realizing what
[2:49:53.680 --> 2:50:01.440]  I've been noticing all along. The line between blaze TV, between, you know, Fox News who
[2:50:01.440 --> 2:50:06.920]  in infowars is getting blurred in the most healthy way possible. I mean, turning point
[2:50:06.920 --> 2:50:14.400]  USA's drew Hernandez frontline show just got banned off of YouTube permanently for
[2:50:14.400 --> 2:50:20.000]  being too extreme. Turning point USA, who people criticize Charlie Kirk, they criticize
[2:50:20.000 --> 2:50:25.840]  the organization for what being neocons or soft on politics. It's 2022 folks, the time
[2:50:25.840 --> 2:50:31.120]  to start fighting your allies has ended the time to realize the common enemy and to start
[2:50:31.120 --> 2:50:35.800]  pairing together and to focus on on the threat has come to to the beginning. And we need
[2:50:35.800 --> 2:50:41.880]  to start and rethink our strategy in our war and realize these petty fights and this stupidity
[2:50:41.880 --> 2:50:46.600]  is not what's gonna be worth it. We can fight all the time about, you know, how much we
[2:50:46.600 --> 2:50:52.520]  hate each other, but we can all agree $40 billion is $40 billion too much to Ukraine.
[2:50:52.520 --> 2:50:57.040]  We can all agree that one baby murder through abortion is one baby too much. We can agree
[2:50:57.040 --> 2:51:01.720]  that Klaus Schwab's world economic form existing for one more hour is one hour beyond what
[2:51:01.720 --> 2:51:06.880]  this world can afford. Like wake up people and realize that if the left sees that we're
[2:51:06.880 --> 2:51:10.920]  uniting, then you've got to wake up as well and see we've all come to the understanding
[2:51:10.920 --> 2:51:15.840]  that we need Christ. We need we need Christ crucified. We need Jesus in our lives. We
[2:51:15.840 --> 2:51:19.440]  need the Holy Spirit. And guys, I tell you this, all the Christians that are weak out
[2:51:19.440 --> 2:51:23.240]  there saying, we've got to turn the other cheek, turn the other cheek. Look, you've
[2:51:23.240 --> 2:51:26.920]  turned your cheeks 20 times. They've been slapped 10 times each side. You only got two
[2:51:26.920 --> 2:51:30.200]  of them, my friend. The only other cheeks you got are the ones on your rear end. And
[2:51:30.200 --> 2:51:34.400]  I'm not willing to take a spanking from them anymore. Genuinely and concerningly, remember
[2:51:34.400 --> 2:51:39.640]  you are the hands and the feet of Christ. And so take your hands and go out into battle.
[2:51:39.640 --> 2:51:42.840]  You can go ahead and be a mitochondria or whatever, be a power cell, but I want to
[2:51:42.840 --> 2:51:45.960]  be the hands. Oh, and you know what I'm talking about? I want to get into battle. I want to
[2:51:45.960 --> 2:51:50.520]  get into info war. I want to actually get into this fight to know and let them know
[2:51:50.520 --> 2:51:53.760]  that we're not going to take this sitting down any longer and that you want to destroy
[2:51:53.760 --> 2:51:57.920]  our outlets. You want to destroy our shows. You want to keep the platforming us like Savannah
[2:51:57.920 --> 2:52:02.400]  Hernandez has been multiple times as she, as she, you know, succeeds downwards as they
[2:52:02.400 --> 2:52:07.160]  just try to destroy their lives, destroy Alex, destroy you, destroy Harrison. It's like,
[2:52:07.160 --> 2:52:11.120]  no, the time is over. You've got to realize we've got friends in high places and you can't
[2:52:11.120 --> 2:52:15.920]  destroy us all. And I think Republicans have realized this now. It's really a matter of
[2:52:15.920 --> 2:52:21.160]  how much leverage they have or what they can do with what they have right now, that all
[2:52:21.160 --> 2:52:25.920]  the, the apparatchets being set up by the Democrat party in the deep state, Obama holdovers
[2:52:25.920 --> 2:52:33.600]  and elsewhere. Those apparatchets must be demolished. They must be. We cannot let the
[2:52:33.600 --> 2:52:41.160]  IRS hire 87,000 neoliberals to go after conservatives. We cannot do it. We have to stop the spying
[2:52:41.160 --> 2:52:46.080]  on American citizens, the weaponizing of the FBI and other government bureaucrats against
[2:52:46.080 --> 2:52:51.720]  the American citizens. This has to be stopped now. Now it must be stopped. And I think some
[2:52:51.720 --> 2:52:56.880]  Republicans are realizing that. So I do see that awakening on the right side of American
[2:52:56.880 --> 2:53:01.240]  political discourse. Now let's go to the left side. They're losing their minds like nothing
[2:53:01.240 --> 2:53:07.000]  we've ever seen before. The average liberal out there is so far off the map of reality.
[2:53:07.000 --> 2:53:10.600]  I don't even think we're ever going to be able to find them again. Here's a perfect
[2:53:10.600 --> 2:53:15.880]  example. Now granted, this is a soap opera star. So she's probably not that bright to
[2:53:15.880 --> 2:53:21.120]  begin with, but listen to this absolute lunacy that they believe now. And folks, you go look
[2:53:21.120 --> 2:53:26.640]  at this tweet that Nancy Lee Grand put out. Liberals actually believe this. They actually
[2:53:26.640 --> 2:53:32.640]  believe this. Here it is. Dear FBI, I know you don't need advice from a soap star, but
[2:53:32.640 --> 2:53:40.240]  having been in 10 or 10,000 implausible storylines in my 37 years, I recommend digging up Ivana
[2:53:40.240 --> 2:53:47.080]  Trump. Clearly it didn't take 10 poll bears to carry a lipo suction 73 year old who me
[2:53:47.080 --> 2:53:54.640]  thinks was in her weight in classified docs. She's saying she thinks Ivana Trump was killed
[2:53:54.640 --> 2:53:58.560]  by Donald Trump, which they do believe that they put those stories out there. And then
[2:53:58.560 --> 2:54:05.760]  they stuffed her body cavity with classified documents. Elijah, these liberals are so far
[2:54:05.760 --> 2:54:10.920]  off the map of reality. They're gone. The tether has snapped. They're out in space.
[2:54:10.920 --> 2:54:16.720]  There's no gravity that can bring them back. I mean, this is backcraft crazy. Yeah. And
[2:54:16.720 --> 2:54:23.080]  she'll keep her account too. I mean, the insinuation, the disrespect, the desecration
[2:54:23.080 --> 2:54:29.760]  of somebody who died. How dare you, you know, come to a responsible, responsible conclusion
[2:54:29.760 --> 2:54:34.960]  that somebody killed their wife and use the corpse or ex-wife to stuff papers into as
[2:54:34.960 --> 2:54:38.680]  if these people are so stupid that if they wanted to get rid of documents, they just
[2:54:38.680 --> 2:54:43.880]  could. But they can't handle the fact their lives are so delusional. They're filled with
[2:54:43.880 --> 2:54:49.160]  the heart of Satan. I mean, these are the people whose idols are pedophiles. They love
[2:54:49.160 --> 2:54:55.720]  to sexually assault one another. They live a life of deceit and of manipulation. And
[2:54:55.720 --> 2:55:01.080]  the way they think we're living the same lives, they try, but we're not because we're children
[2:55:01.080 --> 2:55:06.200]  of light. Yeah, we make mistakes. A lot of men, women here, you've made, you've, you've,
[2:55:06.200 --> 2:55:10.600]  you know, blown up your life at one point and then you realize, yeah, I need God. Maybe
[2:55:10.600 --> 2:55:15.360]  you're still messing up and you go, hey, I need redemption. But guess what? These people
[2:55:15.360 --> 2:55:19.320]  don't understand that. They don't realize that God can redeem people, that there are
[2:55:19.320 --> 2:55:24.240]  actual light warriors, like those at Info Wars, people out there in the media at Daily
[2:55:24.240 --> 2:55:28.760]  Wire, Blaze TV, people fighting the good fight of faith. And they don't realize that we're
[2:55:28.760 --> 2:55:33.560]  not going to lose. No matter what lies they concoct, we aren't going to lose because even
[2:55:33.560 --> 2:55:38.720]  in the end, we still end up winning because judgment comes upon the wicked. And even if
[2:55:38.720 --> 2:55:42.800]  it's not by our hands or by our sword, it's by the sword of the, of the, of the son of
[2:55:42.800 --> 2:55:47.200]  God coming down on a white horse and a robe dipped in blood, they need to understand that
[2:55:47.200 --> 2:55:52.160]  this is a supernatural battle and that we can see through their delusions. Like God said,
[2:55:52.160 --> 2:55:55.900]  he would harden their hearts so that they would be deceived by their own lies like the
[2:55:55.900 --> 2:55:59.520]  Romans were in chapter one. They would, they would give up natural affection. They would
[2:55:59.520 --> 2:56:04.480]  give up logic. They would keep pursuing the truth, but never arrive. We're in a holy battle,
[2:56:04.480 --> 2:56:08.800]  and you know we are, and we can't give up hope no matter how blackpilled or discouraged
[2:56:08.800 --> 2:56:14.120]  we feel at times, no matter how tired the time to engage is now.
[2:56:14.120 --> 2:56:17.800]  Elijah Schaefer with us here, host of Slightly Offensive. One more thing, Elijah, before
[2:56:17.800 --> 2:56:23.880]  I let you go. The monkeypox phenomenon is truly hilarious. The media coverage of it.
[2:56:23.880 --> 2:56:29.400]  Can the monkeypox virus spread via clothes or groceries? And so it's, oh, it's everything,
[2:56:29.400 --> 2:56:34.320]  but what's actually causing it. It's the sodomy. It's the gay orgies. And then it's 99% of
[2:56:34.320 --> 2:56:39.400]  the monkeypox cases are sexually active gay men. Half of them have HIV positive going
[2:56:39.400 --> 2:56:43.400]  to these orgies. And then kids get it and they say, the kid did have contact with gay
[2:56:43.400 --> 2:56:47.440]  men, but see they, oh, it's everything else. Monkeypox might be caused by this, that or
[2:56:47.440 --> 2:56:50.880]  the other thing. But don't mention the gay orgies that went on during Pride Month that
[2:56:50.880 --> 2:56:54.080]  obviously caused this outbreak. Don't, anything but that, Elijah.
[2:56:54.080 --> 2:56:59.920]  Yeah, it's weird that the only groceries that are causing monkeypox is vegetable bags of
[2:56:59.920 --> 2:57:05.520]  eggplants, bananas and large sized cucumbers in plastic bags that for some reason were wrapped
[2:57:05.520 --> 2:57:09.640]  around the vegetables using a rubber band. I'm not going to say, I don't know. Maybe
[2:57:09.640 --> 2:57:14.800]  it was the groceries. Maybe it wasn't, but it's a little suspicious.
[2:57:14.800 --> 2:57:20.840]  That's it. You figured it out. It was, it was cucumbers and eggplants that spread monkeypox.
[2:57:20.840 --> 2:57:24.160]  Forget about how they got there or where they ended up. It's just, you know, let's blame,
[2:57:24.160 --> 2:57:30.520]  let's blame the inaminate fruit objects. The fruit objects being used by the fruits.
[2:57:30.520 --> 2:57:34.800]  That's what they're saying. I'm not saying it because I'm not a bigot, but you know,
[2:57:34.800 --> 2:57:38.320]  we'll go ahead and keep it and say, stop monkeying around with monkeypox. Maybe that's why they're
[2:57:38.320 --> 2:57:41.440]  using bananas because it's just all about monkeying around.
[2:57:41.440 --> 2:57:48.800]  But hey, monkeys are under attack now. So don't be bigoted against monkeys. All right.

[2:58:42.800 --> 2:58:48.000]  available at infowarstore.com.
[2:58:48.000 --> 2:58:52.120]  The great reset in the war for the world is the book that the government doesn't want
[2:58:52.120 --> 2:58:57.120]  you to read that most of the big powerful companies trying to control your life, the
[2:58:57.120 --> 2:59:01.840]  big tech companies, they don't want you to read this book. They want to control what
[2:59:01.840 --> 2:59:06.560]  you think, what you do, what you read, but you don't want that. And Alex Jones doesn't
[2:59:06.560 --> 2:59:11.600]  want that. And this book shows you what's happening and gives you the sort of playbook
[2:59:11.600 --> 2:59:16.600]  for how to fight against it. And so by buying this book, you're going to prove that censorship
[2:59:16.600 --> 2:59:22.080]  doesn't work, that freedom is alive in this country. This is essential reading. And you
[2:59:22.080 --> 2:59:26.880]  know, I would go right now and buy it before the censorship kicks in. It's not going to
[2:59:26.880 --> 2:59:30.960]  be available in bookstores. It's not going to be available in libraries. They're going
[2:59:30.960 --> 2:59:35.080]  to try to take it down from every platform that they can, but they're not going to be
[2:59:35.080 --> 2:59:40.320]  able to do it. Prove that censorship doesn't work by the great reset. Thank you, Alex Jones.
[2:59:40.320 --> 2:59:44.640]  I really appreciate you having me on and I appreciate you writing this book and getting
[2:59:44.640 --> 2:59:48.600]  the information out there.
[2:59:48.600 --> 2:59:56.080]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:59:56.080 --> 3:00:10.840]  All right, so Chip Roy is calling out Congress who haven't read the bill and are not even
[3:00:10.840 --> 3:00:15.080]  properly voting on the inflation reduction act bill. He says this, the vast majority,
[3:00:15.080 --> 3:00:19.200]  if not all members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans who are signing this letter
[3:00:19.200 --> 3:00:24.920]  to vote by proxy are lying. There is no other way to describe it and they are lying to vote
[3:00:24.920 --> 3:00:30.440]  on a massively harmful bill from the comfort of home vacation or otherwise. So it's the
[3:00:30.440 --> 3:00:36.640]  inflation reduction act and they're not even showing up to vote on it. They're just voting
[3:00:36.640 --> 3:00:41.440]  from home or vacation or wherever who knows, he just says they're lying about it, but it
[3:00:41.440 --> 3:00:47.480]  gets even worse. So not only are they not legitimately voting on this bill, $433 billion
[3:00:47.480 --> 3:00:51.240]  inflation reduction act bill, they can't even show up to work. They got to have a nice lavish
[3:00:51.240 --> 3:00:54.120]  vacation while Americans are suffering and then vote on this bill that's going to crush
[3:00:54.120 --> 3:01:00.760]  us even further. Listen to what Jean Pierre admits that nobody has even read the bill
[3:01:00.760 --> 3:01:03.000]  or seen it in clip 11.
[3:01:03.000 --> 3:01:08.080]  Well, let's get this bill passed and then we'll see how the mechanics and all of that
[3:01:08.080 --> 3:01:12.880]  is going to work for a way. Well, let's get this bill passed and then we'll see how the
[3:01:12.880 --> 3:01:15.120]  mechanics and all of that is going to work for.
[3:01:15.120 --> 3:01:18.520]  So oh, let's get it passed and then we can see what's in it. Let's get it passed. Then
[3:01:18.520 --> 3:01:22.120]  we'll see. But they're promising you. It's the greatest thing ever. We got to pass this
[3:01:22.120 --> 3:01:26.640]  thing inflation reduction act. It'll bring inflation down. Yeah, we haven't read it.
[3:01:26.640 --> 3:01:29.880]  We don't know what's in it and we're out on a beach somewhere just signing a piece of
[3:01:29.880 --> 3:01:35.000]  paper. But come on, it's going to be great. Vote for it, y'all. Amazing stuff. But it
[3:01:35.000 --> 3:01:38.480]  gets even crazier.
[3:01:38.480 --> 3:01:43.840]  You can believe that. But let's recall the inflation reduction act. Wait a second. Joe
[3:01:43.840 --> 3:01:52.560]  Biden just told us we have zero percent inflation. Remember? So why do we need an inflation reduction
[3:01:52.560 --> 3:01:58.040]  act if we have zero percent inflation? That's Biden's own words. So Democrats say we have
[3:01:58.040 --> 3:02:02.560]  zero percent inflation, but then they want to pass an inflation reduction act. Well,
[3:02:02.560 --> 3:02:07.760]  which one is it? It gets even crazier. Actually, and remember, they've also said inflation
[3:02:07.760 --> 3:02:14.400]  is a good thing. Here's representative Jaya Paul in a street interview with Fox News. According
[3:02:14.400 --> 3:02:19.160]  to her, inflation isn't even real.
[3:02:19.160 --> 3:02:24.400]  Is ultimately going to lead to a reduction in overall inflation, but most importantly
[3:02:24.400 --> 3:02:29.120]  to the budget that people have every single day. Inflation is like a theoretical word
[3:02:29.120 --> 3:02:35.320]  that economists use, but what families feel every day is the up or down of cost. Oh, that's
[3:02:35.320 --> 3:02:39.320]  not probably going to happen. Oh, inflation isn't even real, guys. Oh, inflation is good.
[3:02:39.320 --> 3:02:43.160]  Oh, inflation doesn't exist. Oh, inflation isn't even real. By the way, we have zero
[3:02:43.160 --> 3:02:47.880]  percent inflation, but we need to pass the inflation reduction act.
[3:02:47.880 --> 3:02:51.600]  You know, here's a little clue on where Americans are at economically. We already played the
[3:02:51.600 --> 3:02:56.320]  clip. Americans are going to Mexico to do shopping and get gas because it's so expensive
[3:02:56.320 --> 3:03:01.160]  here. What about repossessions? This is a sign of where Americans are at here in clip
[3:03:01.160 --> 3:03:07.760]  nine. Patriots, the repo man is getting busy and that's an ominous sign of Biden's car
[3:03:07.760 --> 3:03:11.960]  troubles for the numbers. Let's go to a chalk talk brought to you by Getter. Repossessions
[3:03:11.960 --> 3:03:18.800]  have now risen to 15,000 per day nationwide in America. Why? Because of unsustainable debt,
[3:03:18.800 --> 3:03:25.480]  total auto loan debt, $1.43 trillion a record. And for the first time ever, the average loan
[3:03:25.480 --> 3:03:32.400]  balance is over $20,000 per car. That means a monthly payment of $730 every single month
[3:03:32.400 --> 3:03:37.080]  that so many consumers simply can't afford because prices are skyrocketing everywhere
[3:03:37.080 --> 3:03:41.880]  in their life. Now, let's look at an affordability index. How many weeks does it take to work
[3:03:41.880 --> 3:03:48.680]  for the average worker to buy the average new car? Back in 2013, it took 36 weeks. 2019
[3:03:48.680 --> 3:03:52.800]  after Trump, it went all the way down to only 32 weeks. For most of the last decade, this
[3:03:52.800 --> 3:03:59.400]  number was pretty stable at 35 weeks, but now it explodes up to 42 weeks. You're working
[3:03:59.400 --> 3:04:05.560]  an extra seven weeks to buy a car and it's because of Biden and the Democrats.
[3:04:05.560 --> 3:04:10.000]  So let's try to put all this into perspective if we can and it's not going to make any sense,
[3:04:10.000 --> 3:04:16.440]  but here it is. So inflation isn't happening, but inflation is a good thing. Inflation is
[3:04:16.440 --> 3:04:22.720]  at 0%, but we need to pass the Inflation Reduction Act that nobody has even read or can read
[3:04:22.720 --> 3:04:27.760]  until it's passed, but also inflation is just a theoretical thing that doesn't exist in
[3:04:27.760 --> 3:04:33.080]  the real world. And by the way, the Joe Biden economy is a booming economy, greatest economy
[3:04:33.080 --> 3:04:40.600]  ever, even though in every single column or statistic you look at, the economy is actually
[3:04:40.600 --> 3:04:47.040]  in the complete gutter. Did I get it all out? Did it all make sense? No, it didn't. It's
[3:04:47.040 --> 3:04:52.520]  all BS, it's all propaganda, it's all Democrat Party, mainstream media, deep state lives,
[3:04:52.520 --> 3:04:58.160]  but they're trying to crush America, so we shouldn't be surprised.

[3:06:00.000 --> 3:06:06.680]  Raging War on Corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[3:06:06.680 --> 3:06:14.800]  the Info War. And welcome back to this live Friday edition
[3:06:14.800 --> 3:06:18.520]  of the Alex Jones show. I want to thank Owen Troyer and others who did a great job today.
[3:06:18.520 --> 3:06:22.640]  I'm here on the road filing reports. I'll be filing more reports over the weekend and
[3:06:22.640 --> 3:06:27.520]  I'll be doing the entire Sunday show, 4 to 6 PM live from the location I'm at here in
[3:06:27.520 --> 3:06:33.080]  the Midwest. I wanted to talk about a giant story that broke last night. And that's the
[3:06:33.080 --> 3:06:38.200]  World Economic Forum coming out and saying, not as that you will eat the bugs and you'll
[3:06:38.200 --> 3:06:44.840]  like it or you'll own nothing and like it, but that we need to merge AI pre-crime surveillance
[3:06:44.840 --> 3:06:50.520]  over the entire Internet so that you are precluded from posting tens of thousands of
[3:06:50.520 --> 3:06:56.240]  different terms or ideas in any combination from ever even making it onto the Internet
[3:06:56.240 --> 3:07:01.120]  so that using a pre-crime system you are stopped before you can even make those posts.
[3:07:01.120 --> 3:07:05.360]  Now this has already been going on with some of the AI they've put in over Facebook and
[3:07:05.360 --> 3:07:11.160]  Twitter in the last few years as well as Google. But now they are institutionalizing this entire
[3:07:11.160 --> 3:07:19.520]  system of pre-crime. And pre-crime in and of itself is surveillance. It means we're all
[3:07:19.520 --> 3:07:24.320]  being surveilled in live time and they are forcing this structure over the American
[3:07:24.320 --> 3:07:29.520]  people and people of the world for total control. Then whether you're in the U.S. or Europe
[3:07:29.520 --> 3:07:36.320]  or Australia, it's the very same globalist great reset policies of massive hiring sprees
[3:07:36.320 --> 3:07:42.360]  of armed domestic political police forces that are arresting people for their free speech
[3:07:42.360 --> 3:07:47.400]  in places like England because they posted a trans flag with a swastika on it and said
[3:07:47.400 --> 3:07:51.800]  they didn't agree with the trans movement targeting children. That's what's happening
[3:07:51.800 --> 3:07:56.360]  in England, people being arrested for their speech. And now here in the United States
[3:07:56.360 --> 3:07:59.480]  with the presence they've been trying to set with myself and others, they're selling
[3:07:59.480 --> 3:08:03.560]  the idea that if you question an official narrative, you can be sued into oblivion and
[3:08:03.560 --> 3:08:08.520]  they're bragging and admitting they're going to use this to shut down the populist, anti-globalist
[3:08:08.520 --> 3:08:14.160]  movement here in the United States and again other nations. This is a coordinated, absolute
[3:08:14.160 --> 3:08:18.920]  tyranny. And what's sick about it is people like General Milley, we now learn, threatened
[3:08:18.920 --> 3:08:24.320]  to resign under Trump and they've now released his resignation letter that he never issued
[3:08:24.320 --> 3:08:28.960]  when he was still in the Trump administration as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
[3:08:28.960 --> 3:08:32.920]  and in it he said that Trump was a tyrant and that Trump was taking liberties and that
[3:08:32.920 --> 3:08:37.080]  Trump wanted to use the military against the American people when none of that was true.
[3:08:37.080 --> 3:08:41.840]  All Trump tried to do was get the National Guard out to stop the burning of major cities
[3:08:41.840 --> 3:08:47.640]  during the summer of rage and the so-called mostly peaceful protest. So they engage in
[3:08:47.640 --> 3:08:52.880]  this garbage over and over again claiming that Trump or the right wing or populist movements
[3:08:52.880 --> 3:08:58.320]  or nationalist movements are the ones oppressing people but it's the left censoring and surveilling
[3:08:58.320 --> 3:09:04.520]  and controlling and demonizing and suing and attacking. On top of that we now have the IRS
[3:09:04.520 --> 3:09:12.440]  training included armed agents carrying out simulated raids on family homes and of course
[3:09:12.440 --> 3:09:19.400]  over the years ordering billions of dollars of bullets and posting job applications for
[3:09:19.400 --> 3:09:24.000]  people that quote want to use lethal force. So while they try to defund the police from
[3:09:24.000 --> 3:09:30.000]  stopping robbers and kidnappers and killers with George Soros controlling almost every
[3:09:30.000 --> 3:09:36.680]  city's DA's and other county attorneys and prosecutors, they're moving to create that
[3:09:36.680 --> 3:09:42.800]  domestic security force just as big and just as strong as our military. Little Obama talked
[3:09:42.800 --> 3:09:49.880]  about right when he was getting into office now more than 15 years ago. This is an incredible
[3:09:49.880 --> 3:09:56.480]  time to be alive. It's an incredibly dangerous time to be alive but the power structure in
[3:09:56.480 --> 3:10:00.440]  their own documents admits they're in trouble. The world's turning against them and that's
[3:10:00.440 --> 3:10:05.480]  why they're trying to accelerate their new order plan of the technocracy of the AI of
[3:10:05.480 --> 3:10:10.720]  the total control grid ahead of humanity regaining control of our destiny. So here's some of
[3:10:10.720 --> 3:10:15.880]  the notes I wrote just about what's currently happening in our civilization. This is a total
[3:10:15.880 --> 3:10:22.320]  control system AI run human programmed. This is an open world ministry of truth establishing
[3:10:22.320 --> 3:10:26.800]  including here domestically what I call what they call full spectrum dominance. You have
[3:10:26.800 --> 3:10:32.280]  the IRS as their new major enforcement arm. We have the new terror directive signed last
[3:10:32.280 --> 3:10:39.480]  year by Obama's minion Biden saying questioning open borders, lockdowns, force inoculations
[3:10:39.480 --> 3:10:46.200]  or short storm elections is an act of terror. We also have their domestic anti-fub brown
[3:10:46.200 --> 3:10:52.320]  shirt thugs running around harassing conservatives and Christians and pro-life organizations
[3:10:52.320 --> 3:10:58.880]  viciously around the country and they call it hunting the populist, hunting the conservatives
[3:10:58.880 --> 3:11:04.680]  and they fall in line with the biggest banks, the most powerful groups in the establishment.
[3:11:04.680 --> 3:11:09.600]  We have a surveillance state that carries out the censorship. We have the secretive
[3:11:09.600 --> 3:11:14.200]  informant systems that they've established and then we have General Milley having the
[3:11:14.200 --> 3:11:20.120]  nerve to sit around and claim that President Trump is the one that was trying to establish
[3:11:20.120 --> 3:11:26.640]  a dictatorship. Ladies and gentlemen, Info Wars is now more critical than ever. It is
[3:11:26.640 --> 3:11:32.000]  such a valuable resource in the fight against these people and folks have never been tuning
[3:11:32.000 --> 3:11:36.480]  in more and they've never been realizing how right we've been at this level. We really
[3:11:36.480 --> 3:11:40.880]  are the zeitgeist thanks to your support and your research and your help over the years.
[3:11:40.880 --> 3:11:44.200]  That's why I want to encourage all of you to realize the most important work we've ever
[3:11:44.200 --> 3:11:49.080]  done is now happening right now and I want you to spread the word about this live broadcast
[3:11:49.080 --> 3:11:52.560]  and spread the word about may I not video and keep sharing those articles and video
[3:11:52.560 --> 3:11:59.280]  reports because the mind of the global population is really open to this now and this is the
[3:11:59.280 --> 3:12:04.000]  season for the Great Awakening to explode peacefully and go into high gear. So thank
[3:12:04.000 --> 3:12:08.200]  you all for your support. Let's go back to the live broadcast with Owen Shroyer and others
[3:12:08.200 --> 3:12:12.080]  and as I said, I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. hosting the full show myself. God
[3:12:12.080 --> 3:12:38.120]  bless and good luck.
[3:12:38.120 --> 3:12:44.120]  Some synthetic nanomaterials engineered and produced in the laboratory poisoned our food
[3:12:44.120 --> 3:12:50.760]  supply, planet and our bodies. In an article published in the Journal of Food and Drug Analysis
[3:12:50.760 --> 3:12:59.600]  titled, The Current Application of Nanotechnology in Food and Agriculture from January of 2019,
[3:12:59.600 --> 3:13:03.680]  scientists confirmed that nanotechnology has, quote, welcome back to Alex Jones. I'm your
[3:13:03.680 --> 3:13:07.360]  guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis. Today we're going to be talking about a question
[3:13:07.360 --> 3:13:11.440]  that I get asked all the time which I don't think we've really covered in depth here in
[3:13:11.440 --> 3:13:16.320]  the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show and that is the issue of predictive programming.
[3:13:16.320 --> 3:13:26.160]  Why and how is it that so many fiction shows, books, movies predict with seemingly precise
[3:13:26.160 --> 3:13:32.520]  amazing detail future events? Is this some sort of mystical occult thing? Is it a spy
[3:13:32.520 --> 3:13:39.040]  thing where agencies are introducing these? Is it a Pentagon directive propaganda operation?
[3:13:39.040 --> 3:13:44.600]  Is it just artists who want to get the word out? Is it a sort of intuition that people
[3:13:44.600 --> 3:13:49.400]  in the arts have perhaps? Well, today I'm going to give several examples of this and
[3:13:49.400 --> 3:13:53.880]  I'm going to give you my thesis and why I wrote two books on this that help explain
[3:13:53.880 --> 3:13:58.800]  how this key element of propaganda actually works. So we're going to work through about
[3:13:58.800 --> 3:14:06.040]  10 examples that are not easy to explain away or to dismiss when it comes to fiction predicting
[3:14:06.040 --> 3:14:12.240]  things sometimes 10, 20 years ahead of time with precise detail. So what is exactly this
[3:14:12.240 --> 3:14:17.240]  idea of predictive programming? Is it merely propaganda? I think propaganda is a huge element
[3:14:17.240 --> 3:14:23.120]  of this. That's really the key to unlocking how this works and to explaining why this
[3:14:23.120 --> 3:14:26.880]  occurs. It may not explain everything, but it's the key to explaining it. And I'm going
[3:14:26.880 --> 3:14:31.200]  to show you through a lot of research and through a lot of academic studies that there's
[3:14:31.200 --> 3:14:36.800]  a real element to this is a real domain of research in terms of psychological warfare.
[3:14:36.800 --> 3:14:41.880]  It has a pretty lengthy history behind it at least 100 years or so going back to the
[3:14:41.880 --> 3:14:48.120]  British Empire, going back to early studies and propaganda and the realization that fiction
[3:14:48.120 --> 3:14:55.160]  had a much more powerful impact on people than did fact than did news than did dry reporting
[3:14:55.160 --> 3:15:00.840]  of the events. So we think about some examples. We'll get to the examples in a second, but
[3:15:00.840 --> 3:15:04.720]  I want to point out a couple of books that have been written that actually do talk about
[3:15:04.720 --> 3:15:09.760]  this that aren't conspiracy texts. So these are texts that come out of mainline academia
[3:15:09.760 --> 3:15:14.120]  that will help to give us a grounding for why I take the approach that I do. One is a book
[3:15:14.120 --> 3:15:19.800]  called Trisha Jenkins book, the CIA in Hollywood, and she was a University of Texas professor
[3:15:19.800 --> 3:15:25.040]  I believe, but this book is published by UT and she goes into great detail in many chapters
[3:15:25.040 --> 3:15:31.120]  talking about this liaison relationship between the CIA and Hollywood figures like Chase
[3:15:31.120 --> 3:15:37.160]  Brandon, Milt Bearden, who consulted on many, many films and helped to give kind of an understanding
[3:15:37.160 --> 3:15:41.480]  of what the agency and other government agencies wanted portrayed in those films. Another book
[3:15:41.480 --> 3:15:46.720]  that covered this was the academic work Operation Hollywood by David Robb. And so this is going
[3:15:46.720 --> 3:15:51.280]  to, I think, give us a real key into understanding what exactly predictive programming is and
[3:15:51.280 --> 3:15:56.480]  how it works. This is the Alisha Johnson going where I'm a guest host to J. Dyer, J. Zanalysis.
[3:15:56.480 --> 3:16:03.440]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here. And that's
[3:16:03.440 --> 3:16:08.160]  what people recognize and resonate with. And as Ward said, you're not going to find a better
[3:16:08.160 --> 3:16:12.400]  place for information. You might not agree with everything. You might not agree with
[3:16:12.400 --> 3:16:17.000]  all our perspectives, but we cover all the information. And there's nowhere else really
[3:16:17.000 --> 3:16:21.440]  that does it like we do here. Thank you for that, Ward. Infowarsstore.com, by the way,

[3:20:13.480 --> 3:20:19.120]  host, Jay Dyer. Today's analysis, we're covering this topic of propaganda, psychological warfare
[3:20:19.120 --> 3:20:23.820]  and what's sometimes called predictive programming. How does it work? Why does it seem to at times
[3:20:23.820 --> 3:20:28.240]  predict the future? And I'd mentioned a couple books that many years ago were written in
[3:20:28.240 --> 3:20:33.560]  the academic sphere that kind of gave a little bit of a window into a key or unlocking how
[3:20:33.560 --> 3:20:38.640]  this works and why it goes on. And by the way, since these books have come out, this
[3:20:38.640 --> 3:20:44.240]  one was 2004, the Operation Hollywood book. This book detailed how many times there had
[3:20:44.240 --> 3:20:50.960]  been censorship on the part of military and Pentagon agencies that were liaisons between
[3:20:50.960 --> 3:20:56.600]  Hollywood and the filmmakers. And what we see is that a long, long list of films at
[3:20:56.600 --> 3:21:03.040]  that time were known to have been consulted on, changed, censored and so forth. And the
[3:21:03.040 --> 3:21:06.560]  way it worked at that time, what people understood was, well, if you want to use the tanks, if
[3:21:06.560 --> 3:21:10.360]  you want to use the aircraft carriers in the back of your movie or whatever in the background,
[3:21:10.360 --> 3:21:15.280]  you're going to need to alter the scripts to give this or that message in the film.
[3:21:15.280 --> 3:21:19.200]  And it wasn't just military-related films, though. There would actually be all kinds
[3:21:19.200 --> 3:21:23.400]  of films that you wouldn't expect. For example, the Bond films were censored a couple times.
[3:21:23.400 --> 3:21:30.800]  Tomorrow Never Dies, GoldenEye, Clear and Present Danger, 13 Days, The Perfect Storm,
[3:21:30.800 --> 3:21:36.880]  Wind Talkers, Independence Day, GI Joe, Jurassic Park 2, Horace Gump, Black Hawk Down, Pearl
[3:21:36.880 --> 3:21:40.800]  Harbor, Armageddon Top Gun, Crimson Tide, Air Force One, all of these, especially big
[3:21:40.800 --> 3:21:45.600]  blockbuster military films, and particularly films like Pearl Harbor that came out right
[3:21:45.600 --> 3:21:50.640]  before the big nine event, right? And those would be very crucial, films like True Lies
[3:21:50.640 --> 3:21:55.440]  as well, to prepare us for the war on terror narrative that had already been planned and
[3:21:55.440 --> 3:22:01.080]  already been cooked up years before, especially by the neocons. We have films like Failsafe,
[3:22:01.080 --> 3:22:06.840]  Mars Attacks, Outbreak, Space Cowboys, General's Daughter, Sergeant Bilko, Lone Star, Broken
[3:22:06.840 --> 3:22:13.040]  Arrow, Pentagon Wars, Healds of Fire, on and on. I can keep going. Star Trek IV, The Presidio,
[3:22:13.040 --> 3:22:18.880]  The Right Stuff, Top Gun, obvious ones that we would expect were consulted on, censored,
[3:22:18.880 --> 3:22:24.560]  changed and altered because they wanted to have the message at that time that the military
[3:22:24.560 --> 3:22:28.880]  wanted or that the deep state, I think, wanted in a lot of these films. Now, I'm not saying
[3:22:28.880 --> 3:22:33.920]  that everybody was involved in a giant plot. That's just part of the propaganda element
[3:22:33.920 --> 3:22:39.040]  and function that Hollywood served. In fact, the father of modern propaganda, Edward Bernays,
[3:22:39.040 --> 3:22:43.880]  wrote in his propaganda books that Hollywood is the greatest tool of propaganda the world
[3:22:43.880 --> 3:22:49.120]  has ever seen. And so we can begin to see that, okay, so there is a clear connection
[3:22:49.120 --> 3:22:55.040]  between these entities and shows like Alias, JJ Abrams' Alias. We know that the CIA had
[3:22:55.040 --> 3:23:00.960]  a direct consultation relationship on that set. We know that, for example, after the
[3:23:00.960 --> 3:23:07.320]  series, Jennifer Garner went to work for the CIA publicly as a kind of propaganda recruitment
[3:23:07.320 --> 3:23:11.360]  face of the agency, so to speak, through the fiction. So there's always been this deep
[3:23:11.360 --> 3:23:16.520]  relationship. But how deep does it go? How intense is that relationship? How far back
[3:23:16.520 --> 3:23:22.520]  does it go? When I was studying the history of propaganda and the history of spy fiction,
[3:23:22.520 --> 3:23:26.760]  one of the things I came across was British spy fiction. And if you look at the history
[3:23:26.760 --> 3:23:31.160]  of British spy writers, one of the key things that came to the fore here was that a lot
[3:23:31.160 --> 3:23:37.480]  of the people who wrote spy fiction were spies. They worked for secret intelligence. They
[3:23:37.480 --> 3:23:44.000]  worked for MI5, MI6. They worked for these agencies and had seen quite a bit from that
[3:23:44.000 --> 3:23:50.240]  inside world and then wrote about it in fiction. And so fiction writers, then, you know, kind
[3:23:50.240 --> 3:23:54.160]  of, they ended up revealing more than you would have gotten in the news. And the reason
[3:23:54.160 --> 3:23:59.280]  for that is, in the UK, they had the Official Secrets Act, which would prevent them from,
[3:23:59.280 --> 3:24:04.640]  you know, publicly just writing a big expose about, you know, British intelligence or whatever.
[3:24:04.640 --> 3:24:09.160]  So they would write it into their fiction. And so we see famous spies, you know, writing
[3:24:09.160 --> 3:24:13.080]  their accounts, writing their biographies, people like Graham Greene, people like, as
[3:24:13.080 --> 3:24:17.460]  we said, the most famous example, Ian Fleming, of course, that ties directly into Hollywood
[3:24:17.460 --> 3:24:23.480]  and how so many of the bond operations are in a loose sense based on real things that
[3:24:23.480 --> 3:24:28.800]  occurred. And, you know, I was just listening to Alex's broadcast yesterday when he came
[3:24:28.800 --> 3:24:32.700]  on with Owen and he was talking about, you know, Ian Fleming had seen this whole world
[3:24:32.700 --> 3:24:37.520]  of people just like Klaus. And people thought, oh, you know, the blow fell in these characters,
[3:24:37.520 --> 3:24:41.160]  they're fiction, they're not fiction. They're actually based on people that Ian Fleming
[3:24:41.160 --> 3:24:45.720]  was hanging around with, people that he met. And some of these billionaires, for example,
[3:24:45.720 --> 3:24:52.160]  Aristotle and Nasus, he wanted to fund the first bond film. He wanted to fund Dr. Noe.
[3:24:52.160 --> 3:24:56.360]  That didn't happen, but because Ian Fleming was in those circles and Ian Fleming himself
[3:24:56.360 --> 3:25:01.840]  came from a prominent British or actually Scottish banking family, he had seen a lot
[3:25:01.840 --> 3:25:07.120]  of this world from the inside out. He went to, I think, Eton or one of the, you know,
[3:25:07.120 --> 3:25:12.720]  important universities in the UK. And so the recruitment, you know, began for him at college
[3:25:12.720 --> 3:25:17.680]  and a lot of the people that he spent time with, other famous spies, Maxwell Knight,
[3:25:17.680 --> 3:25:23.040]  Dennis Wheatley, also wrote famous spy fiction novels. Well, in the case of Wheatley, he
[3:25:23.040 --> 3:25:27.600]  wrote occult spy fiction novels and he would base some of his villains on the characters
[3:25:27.600 --> 3:25:33.040]  Alistair Crowley, the famous Satanist, as did Ian Fleming, basing the chief and blow
[3:25:33.040 --> 3:25:37.120]  filled in part on Crowley. So the point of all that is just to say that, again, when
[3:25:37.120 --> 3:25:41.080]  you get into the history of spy fiction, you start to realize, hey, how come so many spies
[3:25:41.080 --> 3:25:47.920]  go on to write fiction? I mean, think about Eric Blair, George Orwell. He was a person
[3:25:47.920 --> 3:25:54.920]  who saw the inside of both a socialist and secret police and British intelligence, right?
[3:25:54.920 --> 3:26:01.360]  And he saw that a lot of this is really a bunch of baloney. This dialectical game that's
[3:26:01.360 --> 3:26:05.840]  being played is kind of a bunch of baloney. And so as I was reading about spy fiction,
[3:26:05.840 --> 3:26:09.040]  I started realizing, how come all these people go and write not just fiction, but the right
[3:26:09.040 --> 3:26:15.720]  screenplays. So this is a key way to see why it is this way. The solution, the answer
[3:26:15.720 --> 3:26:21.280]  to why so many movies predict so many things is because people from the intelligence world
[3:26:21.280 --> 3:26:26.440]  go and write screenplays and they write novels. And there's main line writers that write about
[3:26:26.440 --> 3:26:31.400]  this. There's a book by a guy who is a former CIA bureaucrat, Frederick Hitts. He wrote a
[3:26:31.400 --> 3:26:35.280]  book called The Great Game, The Myths and the Reality of Espionage. And the whole book
[3:26:35.280 --> 3:26:41.160]  is just about picking out of the spy fiction and the spy stories and movies the realities
[3:26:41.160 --> 3:26:45.920]  and how much reality there is in those things. But we can't just rely on the fiction, of
[3:26:45.920 --> 3:26:50.500]  course, because not everybody who's writing these is writing them for some altruistic
[3:26:50.500 --> 3:26:55.320]  noble purpose. They might be writing to make a buck. They might be writing to, they might
[3:26:55.320 --> 3:27:01.320]  be writing to get things out. Or they might be writing for propaganda purposes. Do you
[3:27:01.320 --> 3:27:06.840]  know there's actually a movie that is based around this theme? Robert Redford is in a
[3:27:06.840 --> 3:27:10.960]  film called Three Days of the Condor, which I recommend watching if you've never seen
[3:27:10.960 --> 3:27:17.240]  it because his job for the CIA in that film is to read spy fiction, to read novels, to
[3:27:17.240 --> 3:27:22.800]  look for messages that were put into the fiction. And of course, the story is that he gets framed
[3:27:22.800 --> 3:27:30.400]  for some scandal or whatever. And Donald Sutherland is trying to track him down and kill him throughout
[3:27:30.400 --> 3:27:34.320]  the whole movie. But it's a revealing movie because it really gets into a lot of what
[3:27:34.320 --> 3:27:41.720]  I'm talking about. But those are just fiction examples that we see with the spy world intertwines
[3:27:41.720 --> 3:27:46.400]  with Hollywood and what not all well known. But let's keep in mind that it's not just
[3:27:46.400 --> 3:27:52.560]  a cult or spy fiction. It's also science fiction. And so people like H.G. Wells, who I've covered
[3:27:52.560 --> 3:27:58.680]  for many, many years, and we've read a large portion of his writings, Wells was the propagandist
[3:27:58.680 --> 3:28:03.920]  par excellence of his day. He's kind of the Edward Bernays prior to Edward Bernays. And
[3:28:03.920 --> 3:28:11.560]  he really pioneered a lot of techniques in propaganda. And this this idea of using mass
[3:28:11.560 --> 3:28:17.320]  pop sci fi as a tool of propaganda. So when we read his books, we start to realize, Hey,
[3:28:17.320 --> 3:28:23.040]  wait a minute, genetic manipulation, geoengineering. That's actually something that he wrote about
[3:28:23.040 --> 3:28:29.400]  in the at the turn of the century, right in famous books like Island of Dr. Moreau. He
[3:28:29.400 --> 3:28:35.520]  predicts that genetic modification would lead to an entirely new world. And so this island
[3:28:35.520 --> 3:28:40.720]  of Dr. Moreau is kind of a microcosm of what he sees the future world existing as now, not
[3:28:40.720 --> 3:28:44.680]  a big fan of H.G. Wells, because he was a full on straight up alumnus. He was a high
[3:28:44.680 --> 3:28:50.920]  level socialist Marxist Mason who worked for the Royal Society as a fake leftist. But that's
[3:28:50.920 --> 3:28:53.920]  the vision that he has for the future world as we've covered in many of his works. Don't
[3:29:24.640 --> 3:29:32.680]  of books in the world. The great reset in the war for the world is 123456789. We are
[3:29:32.680 --> 3:29:40.680]  now number nine in the world. This is major. This is political. This could fund our war

[3:32:58.400 --> 3:33:11.240]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[3:33:11.240 --> 3:33:15.320]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. And remind you this is a crucial time and be sure to
[3:33:15.320 --> 3:33:21.840]  head over to the infowarstore and support Alex, support the crew by getting those absolutely
[3:33:21.840 --> 3:33:26.800]  necessary products, especially a checkout Alex's new book. I can't wait to get a copy
[3:33:26.800 --> 3:33:31.960]  of that, you know, studying the great reset for many, many years and, you know, getting
[3:33:31.960 --> 3:33:37.440]  a kind of a condensed version of Alex's wisdom on that subject. It's an absolute necessity.
[3:33:37.440 --> 3:33:43.000]  So I'll probably be doing a book report on that book, especially the signed copy that
[3:33:43.000 --> 3:33:47.640]  I intend to get. So be sure and get a signed copy of that. If you want to get into the
[3:33:47.640 --> 3:33:52.160]  real nitty gritty of what the great reset is all about. So we're working through the
[3:33:52.160 --> 3:33:59.280]  examples of British propagandists and fiction writers who had an insight into the real plans
[3:33:59.280 --> 3:34:05.560]  of the elite that they put into fiction. And I can't forget two of the greatest examples
[3:34:05.560 --> 3:34:10.840]  of the 20th century to the top writers of the 20th century who literally vindicate everything
[3:34:10.840 --> 3:34:14.000]  that you hear Alex talk about, everything you've heard me talk about, everything that
[3:34:14.000 --> 3:34:18.480]  the guests and the hosts at infowar store talk about, which is this technocratic New
[3:34:18.480 --> 3:34:26.160]  World Order plan that was literally predicted in Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. And
[3:34:26.160 --> 3:34:32.960]  we know that because CS Lewis, his close buddy for many years, wrote a separate dystopian
[3:34:32.960 --> 3:34:37.400]  spy, well it's not really a spy fiction, but a separate dystopian fiction allegory, Christian
[3:34:37.400 --> 3:34:43.960]  allegory, the space trilogy. And in the space trilogy, he presents the figure of a quasi-Tolken
[3:34:43.960 --> 3:34:50.280]  based figure as the hero of that story, that three part story. And the third installment
[3:34:50.280 --> 3:34:58.360]  has Britain being taken over by a technocratic oligarchy that's all obsessed with scientism
[3:34:58.360 --> 3:35:04.560]  and crushing and depopulating the planet. And the hero that goes against that is this figure
[3:35:04.560 --> 3:35:14.840]  that's sort of emblematic of the ethos of ancient Anglo-Saxon England and that is a
[3:35:14.840 --> 3:35:17.440]  Tolkien himself. Now when we look at Tolkien, we find out that well the Lord of the Rings
[3:35:17.440 --> 3:35:23.760]  trilogy is actually about the dangers of a coming all seeing eye of Sauron technocratic
[3:35:23.760 --> 3:35:32.000]  machine based control of an organic world. And so it's an anti-organic unnatural technocracy
[3:35:32.000 --> 3:35:38.920]  literally in the novel, the trilogy is described that way. It's a misuse of magic, so to speak,
[3:35:38.920 --> 3:35:46.960]  to turn it into sorcery. You can use technology for good things, but Saruman, Sauron, they
[3:35:46.960 --> 3:35:52.560]  begin to discover technological advances to try to turn that towards the enslavement of
[3:35:52.560 --> 3:35:57.880]  the peoples of Middle Earth. And that's just an allegory for not just World War I and World
[3:35:57.880 --> 3:36:03.600]  War II, but for where they, Lewis and Tolkien, knew the royal society and the technocrats
[3:36:03.600 --> 3:36:09.520]  planned to take the entire world. And again, that's proven by the writings of Lewis and
[3:36:09.520 --> 3:36:17.560]  especially Lewis's interactions with Tolkien and the Tolkien character in his novels. Now
[3:36:17.560 --> 3:36:21.640]  one other thing we should mention about Tolkien is that people don't know that at least fairly
[3:36:21.640 --> 3:36:26.320]  recently I think in the last ten years came out that he was actually trained in Spycraft
[3:36:26.320 --> 3:36:30.840]  as well. It's unclear exactly how much training he got, but they wanted him to really work
[3:36:30.840 --> 3:36:35.960]  with Turing and others on decoding the enigma machine. So he was brought in and kind of
[3:36:35.960 --> 3:36:41.440]  given espionage training. And we know that Lewis and Tolkien had knowledge of people
[3:36:41.440 --> 3:36:46.280]  like Bertrand Russell and what their plans were. So kind of like Orwell, you know, somebody
[3:36:46.280 --> 3:36:50.480]  who kind of saw things from the inside, I think we can pause it with a good degree of
[3:36:50.480 --> 3:36:56.560]  certitude that Lewis and Tolkien also had access and insight into that espionage byworld,
[3:36:56.560 --> 3:37:00.000]  perhaps by other members of the Inklings, the group that they were involved in, the
[3:37:00.000 --> 3:37:03.880]  writers group. Some of those people were probably recruited into British intelligence
[3:37:03.880 --> 3:37:07.080]  as well. I can't prove that. I don't know that C.S. Lewis was involved in anything
[3:37:07.080 --> 3:37:11.640]  like that, but it wouldn't surprise me and definitely we know that Tolkien did receive
[3:37:11.640 --> 3:37:20.920]  some degree of espionage training through the military. So let's move on then to some
[3:37:20.920 --> 3:37:26.320]  really curious examples of this that are hard to hand wave, hard to just sort of brush aside
[3:37:26.320 --> 3:37:31.840]  as coincidence, right? Sometimes things pop up on the internet and they're bad examples,
[3:37:31.840 --> 3:37:36.720]  right? They're coincidences or their instances of fiction that came up after the event, right?
[3:37:36.720 --> 3:37:41.160]  I think the instance that a lot of people pointed to a couple of years ago when Trump
[3:37:41.160 --> 3:37:46.240]  was elected was Trump going down an elevator and somebody holding up a sign. And that was
[3:37:46.240 --> 3:37:50.000]  actually a Simpsons episode that was after the event of Trump being elected, right?
[3:37:50.000 --> 3:37:55.440]  So that one doesn't really count. But it is true that in 2000, there was a Simpsons
[3:37:55.440 --> 3:38:01.160]  episode where Trump was president. But actually, if we go through old news clips, we can find,
[3:38:01.160 --> 3:38:04.720]  you know, Trump kind of had the idea that he might run a long time ago. I think there
[3:38:04.720 --> 3:38:09.440]  was even a discussion, I'm going from memory between him and Oprah, like back in the 80s
[3:38:09.440 --> 3:38:13.280]  or 90s, and Trump said something like, I might run, I don't know. But so I don't think there's
[3:38:13.280 --> 3:38:22.760]  anything particularly outlandish or, you know, that we need to look into about that example.
[3:38:22.760 --> 3:38:31.520]  So let's take some better examples. What about the 2013 show Utopia? That was, I believe,
[3:38:31.520 --> 3:38:37.080]  a BBC show. It only ran for two seasons. But this is, I think, I put this at the top of my
[3:38:37.080 --> 3:38:41.880]  list. I was just kind of sketching out some examples that are not easy to just explain
[3:38:41.880 --> 3:38:47.520]  away. And the thing with Utopia is that this was a British series where we had quite a
[3:38:47.520 --> 3:38:52.600]  bit of insight into the inter-workings of the British establishment, not just from the
[3:38:52.600 --> 3:38:57.960]  perspective of British intelligence, which comes up pretty prominently in the series,
[3:38:57.960 --> 3:39:01.720]  but also in terms of the big pharmaceutical corporations and their relationship to the
[3:39:01.720 --> 3:39:06.880]  intelligence agencies and assassinations. And what we find out, not to spoil too much,
[3:39:06.880 --> 3:39:12.720]  but in this series, you have the idea that the corporations, together with food corporations,
[3:39:12.720 --> 3:39:20.680]  big pharma, big food, they have concocted this plot by which they will sterilize the planet.
[3:39:20.680 --> 3:39:27.280]  Now get this. Not only will they sterilize the planet and use a vaccine in the plot,
[3:39:27.280 --> 3:39:36.040]  it's about a vaccine, to accomplish this. One of the engineers that knew about this incident
[3:39:36.040 --> 3:39:44.200]  and what the plan of the establishment was, decided to write a comic book that would reveal
[3:39:44.200 --> 3:39:54.480]  the entire plan. So this is a British fiction dystopia show about predictive programming.
[3:39:54.480 --> 3:40:00.440]  Isn't that kind of wild? I mean, you would think that, you know, people call this crazy,
[3:40:00.440 --> 3:40:04.800]  but here you have a show about this very idea, the things that I've written, you know, two
[3:40:04.800 --> 3:40:11.320]  books about. And in the show, not only does the enigmatic character who writes about the
[3:40:11.320 --> 3:40:17.000]  plan, the plot of the elite, that he put into this comic book, turns out there, the assassins
[3:40:17.000 --> 3:40:22.160]  are coming and taking out and killing. There is an American version, but I think the British
[3:40:22.160 --> 3:40:26.240]  version is better. But the assassins are going and killing the people that have the comic
[3:40:26.240 --> 3:40:30.000]  book because the comic book ends in it revealing too much. But it doesn't just reveal this
[3:40:30.000 --> 3:40:36.280]  giant plot about, you know, depopulation. It has this idea that there are programmed
[3:40:36.280 --> 3:40:41.240]  mind control assassins, right? The character who goes and does some of the assassinations
[3:40:41.240 --> 3:40:47.760]  is clearly explained as a child who was an orphan and was raised to be, through mind
[3:40:47.760 --> 3:40:54.160]  control, a killer, to be an assassin. All of which things, you know, have some degree
[3:40:54.160 --> 3:40:58.920]  of basis in reality. We know there are mind control assassins, at least to some degree,
[3:40:58.920 --> 3:41:03.640]  that's been admitted over the years in the revelations about MKUltra. How advanced those
[3:41:03.640 --> 3:41:09.040]  programs are, we don't know. But it is pretty astounding that utopia was so predictive and
[3:41:09.040 --> 3:41:15.160]  so accurate in terms of the events of what we've seen in the last couple years. But remember,
[3:41:15.160 --> 3:41:20.560]  if we think about the actual plans of things like event 201, and going all the way back
[3:41:20.560 --> 3:41:27.440]  to Crimson Contagion, Clade X, you know, lockstep, a lot of these plans had already been
[3:41:27.440 --> 3:41:32.440]  in white papers prior to the fiction. So it's not, it's not magic. They're not doing this
[3:41:32.440 --> 3:41:37.920]  stuff like with crystal balls. It's that people who are in the establishment or people who
[3:41:37.920 --> 3:41:42.680]  write fiction, they might be from the spot world and they know about these kinds of things.
[3:41:42.680 --> 3:41:48.080]  And they will put it into the fiction either for propaganda or for getting the message
[3:41:48.080 --> 3:41:52.720]  out. Who knows, I can't, I can't determine everybody's motives, obviously. So that would
[3:41:52.720 --> 3:41:56.520]  be all pure speculation. But what I can look at is the fact that a lot of these incidents
[3:41:56.520 --> 3:42:01.640]  come out before the events. And the number two example that I have, these are in those
[3:42:01.640 --> 3:42:07.040]  real specific order, just ones I listed, is the Lone Gunman. The Lone Gunman series was
[3:42:07.040 --> 3:42:11.240]  a one season of a show as a spin off of the X-Files. And of course, everybody knows the
[3:42:11.240 --> 3:42:17.720]  X-Files, the most famous TV show about conspiracies of all time. And I believe it appeared six
[3:42:17.720 --> 3:42:24.320]  months before the events of 9-11. And we have in that remote controlled planes that
[3:42:24.320 --> 3:42:29.480]  are commandeered and then they fly into the towers and bring them down. And this is again,
[3:42:29.480 --> 3:42:36.880]  precise prediction, six, somewhere around six months before the events of 9-11, very
[3:42:36.880 --> 3:42:42.140]  clearly portrayed in that famous episode of the X-Files. And we know from Alex's old
[3:42:42.140 --> 3:42:46.240]  interview back in the day with Dean Haglin from the X-Files, Dean Haglin said in the
[3:42:46.240 --> 3:42:50.880]  interview that there would be CIA on the set consulting and saying, we'd like this to be
[3:42:50.880 --> 3:42:54.480]  here, we'd like you to say this, we'd like this. So this is a real thing, at least according
[3:42:54.480 --> 3:42:58.920]  to Dean Haglin.

[3:46:01.280 --> 3:46:07.680]  strange space between what we've known and what's to come. And right now the most important
[3:46:07.680 --> 3:46:13.880]  thing to remember is don't panic. Stay calm because now is the time that we must get our
[3:46:13.880 --> 3:46:20.560]  bearings and steer the ship onto a safe sound course. There is nothing stopping we the people
[3:46:20.560 --> 3:46:26.880]  from making our own rules and building our own society. All we got to do is survive the
[3:46:26.880 --> 3:46:33.160]  crash. And right now we still have time to prepare. The world fiat currency system is
[3:46:33.160 --> 3:46:40.160]  racing towards zero. It's time to convert it into hard assets now, including food, water
[3:46:40.160 --> 3:46:46.680]  and survival gear to keep us strong and at the ready. Go to preparedtoday.com for the

[3:46:57.680 --> 3:47:11.200]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones. Welcome
[3:47:11.200 --> 3:47:16.080]  back to the Out of Jones from your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis. You know, another
[3:47:16.080 --> 3:47:22.760]  book that I wanted to mention that inadvertently really vindicates a lot of the points that
[3:47:22.760 --> 3:47:31.280]  we make is the famous book by Annie Jacobson, where it's called the Pentagon's Brain. And
[3:47:31.280 --> 3:47:37.520]  it's an entire history of DARPA. And I read this several years ago where the whole thing
[3:47:37.520 --> 3:47:41.120]  did a whole lecture through this. It's a very long book. But if you read it, you'll
[3:47:41.120 --> 3:47:46.280]  be surprised at how much it vindicates a lot of what I'm talking about, especially when
[3:47:46.280 --> 3:47:52.120]  agencies like DARPA are involved in the consultation on various films, especially sci-fi films,
[3:47:52.120 --> 3:47:59.480]  especially films with themes relating to transhumanism. Now, Ms. Jacobson goes into mentioning the
[3:47:59.480 --> 3:48:03.920]  Salk Brain Initiative. She goes into talking about brain computer interfaces. She talks
[3:48:03.920 --> 3:48:10.600]  about MKUltra. She talks about how all of those programs were connected in the narratives
[3:48:10.600 --> 3:48:16.680]  that were put into films on the part of the MKUltra industrial complex and their consultation
[3:48:16.680 --> 3:48:22.080]  on various movies. And she even mentions Kathleen Kennedy. I think she mentions James Cameron
[3:48:22.080 --> 3:48:26.000]  and their consultations back and forth. And it's not just one way. It's not just James
[3:48:26.000 --> 3:48:32.160]  Cameron or whoever's saying, oh, tell me about, you know, what your plan is for, you know,
[3:48:32.160 --> 3:48:38.960]  Terminator bots or whatever. There's also a two-way street where DARPA and the Pentagon
[3:48:38.960 --> 3:48:46.760]  will request and ask for insight from science fiction writers and ask for screenplay writers
[3:48:46.760 --> 3:48:54.000]  to give their ideas and give their insight into creative approaches to these kinds of
[3:48:54.000 --> 3:48:58.040]  technologies. And again, this is something that was theorized for many years. You have
[3:48:58.040 --> 3:49:02.560]  to keep in mind that not a lot of people 10, 15 years ago knew about this relationship
[3:49:02.560 --> 3:49:08.240]  between Hollywood and the CIA and DARPA and these various agencies. And yet as time passes,
[3:49:08.240 --> 3:49:13.480]  we find out more and more how closely linked they are through mainline texts. And you understand
[3:49:13.480 --> 3:49:18.360]  I'm not giving you conspiracy texts. I'm giving you mainline histories of these texts, of
[3:49:18.360 --> 3:49:24.440]  these agencies and their relationships between one another and the power of propaganda through
[3:49:24.440 --> 3:49:31.880]  fiction, right? The power of telling a story rather than just reading dry boring facts.
[3:49:31.880 --> 3:49:37.480]  So let's get to a couple other examples that were that are pretty profound that I think
[3:49:37.480 --> 3:49:45.000]  defy some sort of easy, you know, hand-waving vexile or vexile. I don't know how to pronounce
[3:49:45.000 --> 3:49:49.880]  it. I'm not a huge anime watcher or fan of anime. But I mean, people could predict, I
[3:49:49.880 --> 3:49:53.800]  mean, people could point to things like Ghost in the Shell, which are old, you know, 90s.
[3:49:53.800 --> 3:50:02.160]  But this one sticks out because this was a 2007 anime series or film that focuses on
[3:50:02.160 --> 3:50:11.840]  a future dystopia in Japan, where get this, there is a vaccine that's an experimental,
[3:50:11.840 --> 3:50:15.760]  the dystopian government really forces everybody to get this, this experimental vaccine, but
[3:50:15.760 --> 3:50:26.000]  it's actually a nanotech, a secret nanotech vaccine that converts everybody into a synthetic
[3:50:26.000 --> 3:50:32.760]  lifeform. The goal of this synthetic lifeform conversion is to create human being, human
[3:50:32.760 --> 3:50:40.080]  being, no real will. Rather, it makes them into a kind of nanotech machine. And so here
[3:50:40.080 --> 3:50:44.720]  you have, again, this whole narrative of the necessity of vaccinations due to, I think
[3:50:44.720 --> 3:50:51.000]  this also has a kind of bio warfare theme to it as well. And that was, again, 2007. So
[3:50:51.000 --> 3:50:56.640]  you have the similar plots to what we've seen in the last couple of years with the so-called
[3:50:56.640 --> 3:51:02.640]  KUFID narrative. And I can't forget the fact that in the new Bond film, No Time to Die,
[3:51:02.640 --> 3:51:07.480]  which we covered in a whole fourth hour here on the Alchemy Zone. So we covered No Time
[3:51:07.480 --> 3:51:12.400]  to Die in great detail. And, you know, just on with Collide Lewis a couple of nights ago,
[3:51:12.400 --> 3:51:16.440]  and shout out to Collide Lewis over at Ground Zero because he reminded me that No Time to
[3:51:16.440 --> 3:51:22.680]  Die actually mentions weaponized smallpox or monkeypox at the beginning of the film.
[3:51:22.680 --> 3:51:28.320]  They actually, and that was written, I think the screenplay would be written around 2019.
[3:51:28.320 --> 3:51:34.400]  No Time to Die was slated to come out in 2019, 2020. And then of course KUFID postponed that
[3:51:34.400 --> 3:51:39.640]  until fairly recently in the past few months, the final Daniel Craig Bond film came out.
[3:51:39.640 --> 3:51:44.920]  And that whole narrative, that whole movie was about the things that we've been dealing
[3:51:44.920 --> 3:51:48.320]  with in the last two years. Pretty amazing, right? I mean, I don't think that's happened,
[3:51:48.320 --> 3:51:54.280]  Stan, again, given this constant relationship that we find between the film producers,
[3:51:54.280 --> 3:52:00.280]  Hollywood movies, and the intelligence agencies in the deep state. So we find out that other
[3:52:00.280 --> 3:52:06.480]  examples like the Iron Man cartoon in 1994, which the episode was called, it was a short-lived
[3:52:06.480 --> 3:52:14.520]  series called The Grim Reaper wears a Teflon coat. Again, it appeared in 1994. And in that
[3:52:14.520 --> 3:52:20.960]  series, you have an elite secret group of evil bad guys that the Avengers and the good
[3:52:20.960 --> 3:52:26.640]  guys always have to fight, who manipulates an engineer as an attack on the World Trade
[3:52:26.640 --> 3:52:33.040]  Tower and the Pentagon and brings down the trade towers and attacks the Pentagon. Again,
[3:52:33.040 --> 3:52:38.840]  that's 1994. And remember, we're told, of course, that, remember Condoleezza Rice saying,
[3:52:38.840 --> 3:52:43.400]  we never had any idea that there would ever be such a thing as an attack on the towers
[3:52:43.400 --> 3:52:48.220]  and the Pentagon when there were countless drills, countless manuals, operation, vigilant
[3:52:48.220 --> 3:52:52.680]  guardian, and so forth, which were precisely about, and even some of the drills that ran
[3:52:52.680 --> 3:52:58.640]  that same day, precisely about attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Towers. And
[3:52:58.640 --> 3:53:05.080]  I mean, the fact that this cartoon in 1994 is so specific and precise, again, is very
[3:53:05.080 --> 3:53:09.160]  odd, very bizarre. And you might think this is kind of outlandish, but if you look into
[3:53:09.160 --> 3:53:15.600]  a lot of the children's cartoon programming, you'll find that quite a few people from high-level
[3:53:15.600 --> 3:53:19.880]  psychological warfare and operations were consultants on a lot of those cartoons, especially
[3:53:19.880 --> 3:53:25.920]  shows like G.I. Joe and Transformers. And if you go back and watch G.I. Joe, for example,
[3:53:25.920 --> 3:53:31.760]  you can watch season one of G.I. Joe, which I think came out in 1983. And you'll find
[3:53:31.760 --> 3:53:36.800]  throughout the first season of the G.I. Joe cartoon references to MK Ultra. You'll find
[3:53:36.800 --> 3:53:42.080]  references to weather weapons, to geoengineering, to atmospheric spraying. You'll find references
[3:53:42.080 --> 3:53:52.480]  to the most striking that I've found was the episode, let's see, it is, I think I had it
[3:53:52.480 --> 3:54:01.440]  written down, yeah, season one, episode 21. And what we have in this is Cobra proposes
[3:54:01.440 --> 3:54:07.920]  his economic recovery plan. And a Cobra's economic recovery plan is that you don't need
[3:54:07.920 --> 3:54:13.240]  to listen to the Federal Reserve because the Federal Reserve has a fiat banking system
[3:54:13.240 --> 3:54:20.440]  and the money is worthless. This is Cobra. Your fiat dollars are worthless. You'll be
[3:54:20.440 --> 3:54:25.320]  transitioning to Cobra bucks, right? So literally, he tells all of America that they need transition
[3:54:25.320 --> 3:54:30.800]  to Cobra bucks, which is like better than the fiat system, which is based on nothing.
[3:54:30.800 --> 3:54:35.600]  So actually Cobra tells you the truth that the fiat money is based on nothing and it
[3:54:35.600 --> 3:54:42.400]  can be infinitely printed into oblivion. The money printer goes, right? Cobra tells you
[3:54:42.400 --> 3:54:48.160]  the truth. But of course, in the show, the bad guy is telling the truth. So a blatant
[3:54:48.160 --> 3:54:52.520]  example of propaganda there. And that wasn't really prediction, but at least it did kind
[3:54:52.520 --> 3:54:57.640]  of reveal quite a few things. Again, as the whole first series of G.I. Joe does, it amazingly
[3:54:57.640 --> 3:55:02.240]  reveals all kinds of kinds of wild things. And I actually looked into one of my lectures
[3:55:02.240 --> 3:55:08.120]  I did many years ago. I looked into one of the consultants who consulted for the military.
[3:55:08.120 --> 3:55:13.040]  I think his name is Friedman, but he's also the consultant on G.I. Joe and Transformers.
[3:55:13.040 --> 3:55:19.520]  So that's why you get these kinds of messages, especially in G.I. Joe. There's no more
[3:55:19.520 --> 3:55:24.200]  revelatory series than season one of G.I. Joe. You even have pop stars that are mind
[3:55:24.200 --> 3:55:28.560]  controlled in season one. That might be season two. I can't remember, but I mean, it's pretty
[3:55:28.560 --> 3:55:33.200]  wild what all is in G.I. Joe. And keep in mind that, you know, my age group when I was
[3:55:33.200 --> 3:55:39.680]  growing up, I mean, that was one of the chief shows aimed at recruitment of people my age
[3:55:39.680 --> 3:55:44.680]  for the military. Don't you want to be involved in special operations and, you know, work
[3:55:44.680 --> 3:55:49.120]  with a team Joe or whatever? But then you find out, right, the way the real world works
[3:55:49.120 --> 3:55:55.240]  is that, you know, actually Joe is run by Cobra. That's how the real world work. James
[3:55:55.240 --> 3:56:00.760]  Bond works for Spectre. That's how the real world works. So I mentioned Danny Jacobson's
[3:56:00.760 --> 3:56:05.960]  book on DARPA. I mentioned 007, No Time to Die. And I would like to mention, too, a couple
[3:56:05.960 --> 3:56:11.000]  other examples in terms of X files that I kind of passed over. If you think about it,
[3:56:11.000 --> 3:56:15.560]  it's not just, I think Band-Aid video had a clip that somebody found of this from season
[3:56:15.560 --> 3:56:21.360]  one or two of X files where, I think it's season two where Scully gets sick. She's infected
[3:56:21.360 --> 3:56:26.760]  with a virus and they talk about it being a DNA manipulating virus and it relate, they
[3:56:26.760 --> 3:56:30.320]  call it the alien virus and all this. And it changes your DNA and turns you into something
[3:56:30.320 --> 3:56:36.920]  else. And even more astounding than that is the 2016 reboot of X files where you have
[3:56:36.920 --> 3:56:43.200]  Scully coming to the realization after her many years of skepticism that, oh, there actually
[3:56:43.200 --> 3:56:48.200]  is this quote, alien virus and the alien virus is in some way connected to the vaccines.
[3:56:48.200 --> 3:56:52.640]  Now, I don't believe in aliens personally, but what I'm saying is that the show is portraying
[3:56:52.640 --> 3:56:58.520]  the alien virus as this thing that manipulates the DNA and they specifically identify in
[3:56:58.520 --> 3:57:04.160]  that clip. Scully specifically identifies the fact that this relates to the manipulation
[3:57:04.160 --> 3:57:09.280]  and flipping of the human genome. It turns humans into something else. Now, I don't know
[3:57:09.280 --> 3:57:15.680]  if that's what's going on. We don't really know, even according to the mainline discussion
[3:57:15.680 --> 3:57:21.840]  of what the mRNA vaccines, quote, unquote, do, they're not, they're genetic experiment
[3:57:21.840 --> 3:57:26.280]  therapies, right? We don't exactly know what they do, but it's very possible that it could
[3:57:26.280 --> 3:57:30.840]  be a kind of experiment. In fact, Jonah Salk in his books talks about it being an experiment
[3:57:30.840 --> 3:57:36.840]  that could be done through inoculations. He says that in survival the wisest. So again,
[3:57:36.840 --> 3:57:41.480]  reality mirrors fiction, fiction mirrors reality. And if you want more on that, you can get
[3:57:41.480 --> 3:57:45.600]  my books on that at Jay's analysis in the shop where I cover this in depth.
[3:57:45.600 --> 3:57:50.720]  People say Alex Jones is crazy. He's a conspiracy theory guy. He's a nutcase. He got these rants
[3:57:50.720 --> 3:57:57.760]  and all that. What they miss is that this guy's ahead of the curve on so many different
[3:57:57.760 --> 3:58:04.880]  topics of signal, not noise. If you look at the signal and you compare that to PBS and
[3:58:04.880 --> 3:58:10.720]  NPR and BBC and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there versus what your collective body
[3:58:10.720 --> 3:58:14.960]  has put out there. And if you're a sent in a human being and just watching it, you say,
[3:58:14.960 --> 3:58:18.520]  well, Alex Jones was ahead of this. Not only that, he kind of explained it. You are one
[3:58:18.520 --> 3:58:23.680]  of the great thinkers of this. That is very rare. You got to go back almost to the revolutionary
[3:58:23.680 --> 3:58:29.000]  generation and see that. In this new book, I got to tell you, when Tony Lyons first approached
[3:58:29.000 --> 3:58:33.880]  me, I read this thing. I go, this is it. This is no beetry. You're not going to be flipping
[3:58:33.880 --> 3:58:36.880]  pages or you're going to be having a pin out. You're going to be underlying stuff.
