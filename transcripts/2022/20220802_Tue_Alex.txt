[00:00.000 --> 00:15.000]  It's already the second of this Tuesday live broadcast, as we hurdle towards the midterms.
[00:15.000 --> 00:36.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:36.000 --> 00:49.000]  If you're going out with someone new, I'm going out with someone too. I won't feel sorry for me.
[00:49.000 --> 00:55.000]  I'm getting drunk, but I'd much rather be somewhere with you.
[00:55.000 --> 01:24.000]  Thank you for joining us on this live Tuesday Worldwide Transmission. I have a stack of Washington Post, New York Times articles and other headlines.
[01:24.000 --> 01:29.000]  Where they say, can we shut Alex Jones down?
[01:29.000 --> 01:38.000]  And where they admit the goal of the four Sandy Hook trials they have lined up that have now started to shut us down,
[01:38.000 --> 01:52.000]  then they brag on CNN and MSNBC with top Democrat officials that the goal is to set this pattern with Alex Jones and then go after everybody else.
[01:52.000 --> 01:55.000]  They say Fox News is next.
[01:55.000 --> 02:01.000]  They have articles where they talk about we're taking down OAN, soon we'll get Fox News.
[02:01.000 --> 02:04.000]  They're going to come for everybody.
[02:04.000 --> 02:12.000]  These are authoritarians. That's why they had to default me in all four cases saying I turned over nothing.
[02:12.000 --> 02:25.000]  While they sit there and show the juries, they're deciding how guilty I am, not if I'm guilty or innocent, showing the juries all these emails and all these videos that we turned over to them.
[02:25.000 --> 02:30.000]  While the judge tells them every day twice a day, remember this man's guilty.
[02:30.000 --> 02:38.000]  You're here to decide how guilty he is. He didn't give us anything. He's a bad person.
[02:38.000 --> 02:48.000]  Even in third world dictatorships, when they have kangaroo courts, they don't have the judge tell the jury this person is guilty.
[02:48.000 --> 02:53.000]  But she says up there, it's a special case.
[02:53.000 --> 03:04.000]  And they're all caricatures of what you would imagine in some alternate universe of dwarf goblins.
[03:04.000 --> 03:14.000]  It's demonic. They all act demonically possessed. The judge, the lawyers, it's surreal to be around them.
[03:14.000 --> 03:24.000]  And it makes you feel sorry for them because these people are committed to a cult ideology of the New World Order.
[03:24.000 --> 03:30.000]  And they're never going to stop. They're getting rid of all the checks and balances, all of our basic freedoms.
[03:30.000 --> 03:37.000]  They've gutted the border. They're promoting pedophilia everywhere. They are just annihilating the social contract.
[03:37.000 --> 03:42.000]  They are destroying our country by design. They have been turned loose.
[03:42.000 --> 03:50.000]  When I talk about they, I mean the general crazed mob of the left.
[03:50.000 --> 04:00.000]  You knew it was coming and it is been announced in Europe and the United States. All the different build back better.
[04:00.000 --> 04:10.000]  Our announcing new lockdowns, new emergencies, new forced masking and bullying to take their poison shots.
[04:10.000 --> 04:18.000]  And it did funny. Bill Gates two years ago ordered a whole bunch of this monkey pox vaccine.
[04:18.000 --> 04:24.000]  And they told us about a year ago, they said soon monkey pox and smallpox will be back.
[04:24.000 --> 04:30.000]  So get ready. We're going to lock you down next year and then right on time it arrived.
[04:30.000 --> 04:38.000]  But you're not supposed to ask questions about election fraud or about the globalist lying about the vaccines working or about mass shootings.
[04:38.000 --> 04:41.000]  You just sit there and you shut up.
[04:41.000 --> 04:50.000]  Yeah, new quote by Fauci came out and said Americans are bad people. They won't adhere to his authority.
[04:50.000 --> 04:54.000]  You authoritarians will fail like all other authoritarians throughout history.
[04:54.000 --> 05:01.000]  But first we must go through the fire. Stay with us.
[05:01.000 --> 05:13.000]  Info wars has been vindicated. We've been proven right. World government, the new world order is out of the open and now more than ever the forces of Satan are trying to shut down this broadcast.
[05:13.000 --> 05:17.000]  The forces of anti-human, godless new world order are out of control.
[05:17.000 --> 05:24.000]  So now realize we have pushed them out of the light. We have pushed them out in the open and they are so upset and they are so scared.
[05:24.000 --> 05:32.000]  So while you still can, because any day can be our last broadcast, spread the word about the show, share the article, share the videos, and please fund us.
[05:32.000 --> 05:36.000]  We're getting great products at the same time at infowarstore.com.
[05:36.000 --> 05:47.000]  Books, films, t-shirts, great supplements, vitamin real fusion, body cells maturmeric formula, Ultra 12, diet force, so much more right now at infowarstore.com.
[05:47.000 --> 05:55.000]  But whatever you do, pray for justice and pray for freedom and pray for the children and pray for free speech and justice to win.
[05:55.000 --> 06:21.000]  Thank you so much for joining us. I'll spread the word my friends. We're involved in an epic historic battle.
[06:21.000 --> 06:36.000]  We've got a huge show lined up for you today. We've got Robert Martin's studio and Owen Schroyer co-hosting and some other special guests.
[06:36.000 --> 06:53.000]  I'm hosting this hour and I'm going to get in the car and drive down to the temple of justice or the temple of injustice when you get the establishment judges to testify today in the show trial where the judge again this morning said,
[06:53.000 --> 07:03.000]  because I've got the Twitter alerts from the different courthouse news agencies to the jury, it's a decided issue. He is guilty. Remember that.
[07:03.000 --> 07:12.000]  He's guilty. You just decide whether you give him 150 million because he questioned the shooting or 50 million.
[07:12.000 --> 07:24.000]  She didn't say that part, but that's what they've been asking for, which is a complete and total joke. And then they sit there and lie in the media and say,
[07:24.000 --> 07:33.000]  oh, court documents show Jones has hundreds of millions of dollars so that the jury thinks I'm this evil rich person.
[07:33.000 --> 07:46.000]  And so they'll try to get some giant verdict to again set the precedent that, oh, George Soros pays to put in all the DA's and lets murderers and kidnappers go with no bail.
[07:46.000 --> 08:00.000]  But questioning a mass shooting or questioning election fraud. Well, that's Prasada non grata.
[08:00.000 --> 08:03.000]  And now the judges said at the start of today's proceedings.
[08:03.000 --> 08:16.000]  Judge gave this warning if at any time she feels like a performance is being given. Oh, because she knows about this by or any testimonies being used for other purposes.
[08:16.000 --> 08:22.000]  What does that mean? She will shut down the live stream and throw out the news media.
[08:22.000 --> 08:29.000]  I have no idea what that woman is talking about.
[08:29.000 --> 08:35.000]  But the first they fix it and declare me guilty. Then they have a show trial.
[08:35.000 --> 08:41.000]  She says she wants it kept from the jury that she found me guilty.
[08:41.000 --> 08:49.000]  She put an order out first saying a few months ago that I couldn't talk about the first amendment or say I was innocent.
[08:49.000 --> 08:52.000]  But that got kicked back by the court of appeals.
[08:52.000 --> 09:02.000]  I mean, imagine a judge saying you cannot say you're innocent and you cannot talk about the first amendment.
[09:02.000 --> 09:08.000]  I mean, we publish that order by the judge on info wars.
[09:08.000 --> 09:18.000]  And then during the pre trial hearings a few weeks ago, she said, well, I did withdraw that because it was going to get overturned by the third court of appeals.
[09:18.000 --> 09:22.000]  But I'm still going to be enforcing basically the same thing.
[09:22.000 --> 09:26.000]  So it's total tyranny. And anytime my lawyer makes a good point, she shuts him down.
[09:26.000 --> 09:33.000]  Won't let him bring any evidence in. We're barred from any evidence because we're defaulted, but then they have a show trial one sided their evidence.
[09:33.000 --> 09:37.000]  So all we're allowed to do is pick apart their evidence.
[09:37.000 --> 09:44.000]  People on the web are like his lawyers well spoken, but he's not fighting.
[09:44.000 --> 09:55.000]  She's already stopped the proceedings that I know of six times and said, Mr. right now is Fred Rico right now.
[09:55.000 --> 09:59.000]  You need to know that I'm looking to sanction you after this trial for what you're doing.
[09:59.000 --> 10:06.000]  You know full well, you're not following my orders.
[10:06.000 --> 10:17.000]  So this is beyond the movie gladiator where they tie up, you know, the top gladiator and stab him in the heart before they send him out on the Coliseum floor to fight.
[10:17.000 --> 10:23.000]  You know, just a ice pick to the heart knowing it would take five, 10 minutes for him to die.
[10:23.000 --> 10:27.000]  Little quick stab to the heart. And now, now you will fight you.
[10:27.000 --> 10:33.000]  Well, this is more like stabbed 15 times in the heart tied up with a lion on top of your head biting you.
[10:33.000 --> 10:37.000]  And then they come out and say, no, let's have our gladiatorial event.
[10:37.000 --> 10:44.000]  And you the judge is primping and they've got an HBO camera where they're all mic'd up and they're they've got dozens of cameras in there.
[10:44.000 --> 10:47.000]  And then they go, this man got famous off Sandy Hook.
[10:47.000 --> 10:50.000]  This man made hundreds of millions of women.
[10:50.000 --> 10:58.000]  This man tortured these innocent people for 10 years.
[10:58.000 --> 11:08.000]  And then finally, they testify and their psychologists testify.
[11:08.000 --> 11:24.000]  And Heslin and his ex-wife hadn't even heard of me until years and years after it and the media brought them the clip of Owen talking about Heslin on
[11:24.000 --> 11:29.000]  Megan Kelly to make him mad and to sue me.
[11:29.000 --> 11:30.000]  That all came out in court.
[11:30.000 --> 11:42.000]  So again, it's all these lawyers and all these Democrats, all these operatives going out to the families and then trying to recruit them to sue me.
[11:42.000 --> 11:43.000]  And you know, there's a name for that.
[11:43.000 --> 11:44.000]  You can get disbarred for it.
[11:44.000 --> 11:47.000]  And that's being investigated right now.
[11:47.000 --> 11:54.000]  But it's just insane to watch this and I'm not going to talk about it much more.
[11:54.000 --> 12:04.000]  Because you tune in here to hear world news and all the huge developments in the situation in Taiwan and the economy and the new lockdowns they've got coming and so much more.
[12:04.000 --> 12:08.000]  So I'm going to stop talking about this now and get all that when we come back.
[12:08.000 --> 12:18.000]  But we filed for bankruptcy on free speech systems because they want us to have this trial.
[12:18.000 --> 12:26.000]  Well, a second trial starts in Connecticut today, jury selection, and my lawyer can't be in two places at once.
[12:26.000 --> 12:32.000]  And then they've got another trial in Texas starting in a month.
[12:32.000 --> 12:43.000]  And the trial in Connecticut, they say, is going to be three months long, two and a half to three months long.
[12:43.000 --> 12:54.000]  So we're talking the trials all overlapping each other, unprecedented, and they're just laughing at us and giggling at us.
[12:54.000 --> 12:57.000]  And of course, we're defaulted in Connecticut as well.
[12:57.000 --> 13:07.000]  It's all coordinated and under federal law, when you file this type of bankruptcy, it is removed to the federal court.
[13:07.000 --> 13:14.000]  The judge yesterday and she had another hearing today in Connecticut said, I don't care.
[13:14.000 --> 13:21.000]  We're going ahead with the trial of Alex Jones and free speech systems, even though under federal law, it's remanded.
[13:21.000 --> 13:31.000]  And the bankruptcy judges and other folks that have looked at this, retired judges and others, have never seen this in the United States.
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.000]  I'm going to say that again.
[13:33.000 --> 13:44.000]  They've never seen judges ignore a bankruptcy removal to federal court.
[13:44.000 --> 13:48.000]  It gets kicked back a lot of times, but no, no, no, this is just up front.
[13:48.000 --> 13:52.000]  You know, we're going to go forward no matter what the federal court says.
[13:52.000 --> 14:01.000]  And the other judge, Judge Goblin here in Austin, I mean, she literally looks like a goblin.
[14:01.000 --> 14:05.000]  I'm just telling you, she acts like a goblin, a very goblinous creature.
[14:05.000 --> 14:09.000]  I actually finally got to see a real goblin.
[14:09.000 --> 14:10.000]  God, I have some fun with it.
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  They take themselves so seriously.
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.000]  I'm a little goblinish too, so it's okay.
[14:14.000 --> 14:19.000]  Maybe that's why I'm so sweet on her, but the point is, is that you got to have some fun with this.
[14:19.000 --> 14:27.000]  She said last Friday when we said, hey, we've declared bankruptcy this afternoon, but we're going to let this trial go forward.
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  We're going to remand it back on Monday morning.
[14:29.000 --> 14:30.000]  She goes, I don't care.
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.000]  I'm going to go forward no matter what you do in federal court.
[14:32.000 --> 14:43.000]  She can't, but they don't care because this is all a giant exercise in raping our freedom
[14:43.000 --> 14:48.000]  and setting the precedent to go after conservatives and populists and patriots.
[14:48.000 --> 14:49.000]  And the judge said it.
[14:49.000 --> 14:50.000]  This is a special case.
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  And here's the New York Times.
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.000]  I've got dozens of articles saying, take down Alex Jones.
[14:55.000 --> 14:56.000]  Destroy Alex Jones.
[14:56.000 --> 14:58.000]  And what's it say?
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  Lies for profit.
[15:00.000 --> 15:03.000]  He's been found guilty of lying by a judge.
[15:03.000 --> 15:08.000]  Can Sandy Hook parents shut down Alex Jones?
[15:08.000 --> 15:11.000]  It's not shut down Alex Jones.
[15:11.000 --> 15:15.000]  Can Sandy Hook parents shut Alex Jones down?
[15:15.000 --> 15:16.000]  It's the globalists.
[15:16.000 --> 15:17.000]  It's the big banks.
[15:17.000 --> 15:19.000]  It's the lawyers they control.
[15:19.000 --> 15:20.000]  That's what they're doing.
[15:20.000 --> 15:21.000]  That's what this is.
[15:21.000 --> 15:24.000]  This is a huge deal.
[15:24.000 --> 15:28.000]  I mean, just four years ago when they were de-platforming, people said, oh, you're not really being de-platformed.
[15:28.000 --> 15:29.000]  You're not really being censored.
[15:29.000 --> 15:31.000]  Now it's the former president of the U.S.
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.000]  But the election's stolen from him.
[15:34.000 --> 15:35.000]  And now it's all of you.
[15:35.000 --> 15:38.000]  And now they're coming with fully weaponized courts.
[15:38.000 --> 15:45.000]  Steve Bannon in D.C. in his criminal trial could not cross-examine the witnesses against him.
[15:45.000 --> 15:50.000]  That's why it's just insane.
[15:50.000 --> 15:51.000]  Totally illegal.
[15:51.000 --> 15:55.000]  But the Democrats are mad dog crazy.
[15:55.000 --> 15:56.000]  They're going for broke, folks.
[15:56.000 --> 16:19.000]  Stay with us.

[17:54.480 --> 17:58.560]  at infowarshot.com, vitamin mineral fusion.
[17:59.640 --> 18:01.720]  The globalists are fighting around the clock
[18:01.720 --> 18:03.400]  to destroy the family,
[18:03.400 --> 18:05.960]  to destroy heterosexual relationships,
[18:05.960 --> 18:07.480]  to annihilate our marriages.
[18:07.480 --> 18:09.600]  And the studies are all clear.
[18:09.600 --> 18:13.640]  The number one cause of marital splits is that
[18:13.640 --> 18:15.880]  there's problems in the bedroom.
[18:15.880 --> 18:19.720]  And the number one issue men have is erectile dysfunction.
[18:19.720 --> 18:22.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes about this
[18:22.640 --> 18:24.680]  because they don't want people having lasting,
[18:24.680 --> 18:26.080]  good, loving relationships.
[18:26.080 --> 18:28.040]  They want to break up society.
[18:28.040 --> 18:31.280]  We are so excited to have the number one

[20:03.360 --> 20:06.960]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:06.960 --> 20:18.960]  MUSIC
[20:18.960 --> 20:23.400]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded
[20:23.400 --> 20:28.120]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed
[20:28.120 --> 20:32.760]  Everybody knows the war is over
[20:32.760 --> 20:37.360]  Everybody knows the good guys lost
[20:37.360 --> 20:41.760]  Everybody knows the fight was fixed
[20:41.760 --> 20:44.040]  The poor stay poor
[20:44.040 --> 20:46.200]  The rich get rich
[20:46.200 --> 20:51.080]  That's how it goes
[20:51.080 --> 20:55.640]  Everybody knows
[20:55.640 --> 21:00.400]  Everybody knows that the boat is leaking
[21:00.400 --> 21:05.080]  Everybody knows the captain land
[21:05.080 --> 21:09.920]  Everybody got this broken feeling
[21:09.920 --> 21:14.200]  Like their father or their dog just died
[21:14.200 --> 21:18.800]  Everybody talking to their pockets
[21:18.800 --> 21:22.800]  Everybody wants a box of chop
[21:22.800 --> 21:25.040]  To take a long stem road
[21:25.040 --> 21:26.040]  Because everybody knows
[21:26.040 --> 21:27.880]  Welcome back on your host Alex Jones
[21:27.880 --> 21:29.520]  Everybody knows
[21:29.520 --> 21:33.200]  So, the party of dehumanization,
[21:33.200 --> 21:34.320]  the party of the New World Order,
[21:34.320 --> 21:36.280]  the party of collapse,
[21:36.280 --> 21:39.520]  the party of the great reset,
[21:39.520 --> 21:43.800]  symbol is not a armband with a swastika on it,
[21:43.800 --> 21:45.880]  it is the mask.
[21:45.880 --> 21:47.200]  The mask of the establishment,
[21:47.200 --> 21:48.560]  the mask of fear,
[21:48.560 --> 21:51.200]  the mask of the vaccines not working,
[21:51.200 --> 21:54.360]  the mask of future continual lockdowns
[21:54.360 --> 21:57.840]  and climate lockdowns
[21:57.840 --> 21:59.520]  and all the rest of the garbage,
[21:59.520 --> 22:01.120]  they're foisting on us.
[22:01.120 --> 22:04.360]  And Obama last week in his third term
[22:04.360 --> 22:07.000]  through his puppet, Biden,
[22:07.000 --> 22:11.600]  signed an order directing the post office
[22:11.600 --> 22:14.560]  to set up a subdivision permanently
[22:14.560 --> 22:19.160]  to deal with drop box ballots
[22:19.160 --> 22:21.560]  and all over the country.
[22:21.560 --> 22:25.000]  They are redoing what they did two years ago
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.360]  stealing the 2020 election
[22:27.360 --> 22:31.240]  with 98 days out from those midterms.
[22:31.240 --> 22:34.200]  And so right in line with that,
[22:34.200 --> 22:35.760]  they have been planning as we've been talking about
[22:35.760 --> 22:38.800]  the last year to bring back lockdowns,
[22:38.800 --> 22:42.080]  masks and all the hysteria
[22:42.080 --> 22:44.560]  either right before or right after the midterms.
[22:44.560 --> 22:45.760]  But to do that,
[22:45.760 --> 22:47.960]  they've got to start ratcheting up the fear
[22:47.960 --> 22:49.320]  and beating the drum
[22:49.320 --> 22:51.160]  because they use behavioral psychology
[22:51.160 --> 22:52.560]  to incrementally say,
[22:52.560 --> 22:54.840]  okay, now mask indoors again.
[22:54.840 --> 22:57.440]  Okay, now only certain businesses are essential.
[22:57.440 --> 23:02.240]  Okay, now that's what they're establishing.
[23:02.240 --> 23:04.960]  New California governor, Gabham Newsom declares,
[23:04.960 --> 23:07.880]  monkeypox, a state of emergency.
[23:07.880 --> 23:09.280]  Same thing in Europe.
[23:09.280 --> 23:10.360]  Same thing in New York.
[23:10.360 --> 23:11.440]  It begins.
[23:11.440 --> 23:14.040]  Democrats in New York City, Illinois
[23:14.040 --> 23:19.120]  declare state of emergency over monkeypox.
[23:19.120 --> 23:21.000]  And AP has the headline,
[23:21.000 --> 23:23.400]  Biden's COVID sequel.
[23:23.400 --> 23:27.600]  Back on the balcony and the dog for company.
[23:27.600 --> 23:30.920]  And he's announcing all the same stuff
[23:30.920 --> 23:33.800]  that we saw right before the lockdowns
[23:33.800 --> 23:35.600]  we've already witnessed.
[23:35.600 --> 23:37.080]  There's a new video.
[23:37.080 --> 23:38.760]  It's up on infowars.com.
[23:38.760 --> 23:40.680]  We'll actually play it next segment.
[23:40.680 --> 23:42.600]  I didn't see it in the list here, maybe it's there.
[23:42.600 --> 23:45.520]  But Fauci complains that Americans
[23:45.520 --> 23:49.160]  will not adhere to the authorities.
[23:50.120 --> 23:51.760]  He made the comments during an interview
[23:51.760 --> 23:54.600]  with Katie Couric, blaming misinformation
[23:54.600 --> 23:57.440]  for influencing people to ditch face coverings
[23:57.440 --> 23:58.920]  and avoid vaccines.
[23:58.920 --> 24:00.680]  Even though they now admit,
[24:00.680 --> 24:03.920]  and Deborah Birx admits, it never worked.
[24:06.280 --> 24:08.840]  And they knew it wouldn't work.
[24:08.840 --> 24:12.480]  But no one in corporate media calls this little demon on it.
[24:13.680 --> 24:15.880]  It may be too late to stop monkeypox
[24:15.880 --> 24:18.320]  becoming an epidemic in the US and Europe,
[24:18.320 --> 24:22.000]  such as the Daily Beast and other globalist echo chambers.
[24:23.040 --> 24:25.600]  Meanwhile, it's now come out
[24:25.600 --> 24:27.840]  that in Kushner's memoir reveals
[24:27.840 --> 24:31.080]  Cuomo knew COVID-19 with rabid nursing homes.
[24:31.080 --> 24:34.200]  So he decided to send COVID patients to the nursing homes
[24:34.200 --> 24:36.240]  while locking their healthy families out.
[24:37.400 --> 24:40.120]  Just straight up mass murder on purpose.
[24:40.120 --> 24:43.600]  But he's a Democrat, so he's a good person.
[24:43.600 --> 24:46.640]  Just don't question election fraud or mass shootings
[24:46.640 --> 24:50.880]  or open borders or the vaccines or we'll have to sue you.
[24:50.880 --> 24:53.680]  You better shut up, you dirty Americans.
[24:55.240 --> 24:57.440]  Better keep your pie holes shut
[24:58.560 --> 25:02.320]  unless you're getting a bunch of monkeypox
[25:02.320 --> 25:03.760]  sprayed into your mouth.
[25:03.760 --> 25:04.720]  Here it is.
[25:06.320 --> 25:10.320]  Germans will be able to legally change their gender
[25:10.320 --> 25:11.600]  once a year.
[25:11.600 --> 25:13.240]  Oh my goodness.
[25:13.240 --> 25:17.600]  Well, how about just like you have a handicap sticker
[25:17.600 --> 25:20.400]  on your car, a handicap deal on your visor
[25:21.480 --> 25:22.880]  or your rear-view mirror,
[25:22.880 --> 25:26.120]  you can just maybe have like a big light
[25:26.120 --> 25:26.960]  on the top of your head.
[25:26.960 --> 25:29.240]  And if it's green, it means you're hetero
[25:29.240 --> 25:32.000]  or it's red, it means you're homosexual
[25:32.000 --> 25:33.720]  or it's gotta be hundreds of colors though.
[25:33.720 --> 25:37.000]  If it's purple, pink, it means you're a pedo.
[25:37.000 --> 25:39.560]  That's the color they use to identify.
[25:39.560 --> 25:42.040]  And maybe you just have a light bulb place
[25:42.040 --> 25:43.320]  on the top of your head and you just screw in
[25:43.320 --> 25:44.520]  the color light bulb.
[25:44.520 --> 25:46.640]  You wanna go out and identify yourself as,
[25:46.640 --> 25:48.240]  again, they're getting rid of all our basic rights,
[25:48.240 --> 25:50.080]  getting rid of our right to not be surveilled,
[25:50.080 --> 25:52.040]  bringing in a global social credit score,
[25:52.040 --> 25:53.720]  bringing in the carbon taxes,
[25:53.720 --> 25:57.120]  bringing in the you'll own nothing, you'll have nothing.
[25:57.120 --> 25:59.320]  Great reset, it's all being announced.
[25:59.320 --> 26:02.960]  But you can paint your hair green or purple
[26:02.960 --> 26:05.600]  and you can go eat poop in the street.
[26:05.600 --> 26:07.680]  That's what they do at these rallies.
[26:07.680 --> 26:10.360]  I'm not kidding, it happens at all of them.
[26:10.360 --> 26:15.080]  We've got the videos now pooping and eating poop
[26:15.080 --> 26:16.640]  and peeing on each other.
[26:16.640 --> 26:18.520]  This is so liberal, so trendy.
[26:18.520 --> 26:21.440]  And then the monkeypox explodes and it's all our faults.
[26:21.440 --> 26:23.200]  We'll have to be locked down now,
[26:23.200 --> 26:25.280]  but don't worry, the pedo parade
[26:25.280 --> 26:26.960]  and the poop eating will continue.
[26:26.960 --> 26:28.960]  And I'm sorry to have to describe this for you folks,
[26:28.960 --> 26:32.360]  but we're talking turd gobbling, okay?
[26:33.960 --> 26:37.560]  Under a new law, Germans will be able to change their gender
[26:37.560 --> 26:41.800]  and first name without having to undergo any surgery
[26:41.800 --> 26:45.080]  once a year every year if required.
[26:45.080 --> 26:48.800]  Yes, really, the self-determination act
[26:48.800 --> 26:52.200]  will allow transgender intersex and non-binary people
[26:52.200 --> 26:53.400]  to change their gender at will
[26:53.400 --> 26:55.080]  merely by visiting a registry office
[26:55.080 --> 26:56.480]  and signing a piece of paper.
[26:56.480 --> 27:01.240]  So maybe one year you wanna be on the women's basketball team
[27:01.240 --> 27:03.400]  and the next year you wanna be on the men's basketball team
[27:03.400 --> 27:07.880]  or a lot of these groups now identify as children.
[27:07.880 --> 27:10.600]  So maybe I can identify as a child
[27:10.600 --> 27:13.160]  and I'll go show up at Pop Warner football
[27:13.160 --> 27:16.320]  and start running over seven and eight year old children.
[27:16.320 --> 27:21.320]  I'll be the greatest Pop Warner football.
[27:21.320 --> 27:26.320]  I'll be the greatest Pee Wee baseball player on earth.
[27:26.320 --> 27:28.240]  And I'll get up there with those six, seven, eight,
[27:28.240 --> 27:30.280]  nine, 10 year olds and that little kid
[27:30.280 --> 27:32.880]  throws that softball at me, I'm gonna hit it.
[27:32.880 --> 27:35.160]  Full power right in his face, man.
[27:35.160 --> 27:38.160]  I'm gonna spit some chewin' tobacco on him.
[27:38.160 --> 27:39.200]  That's obscene, isn't it?
[27:39.200 --> 27:41.360]  It's crazy, but that's where they're going.
[27:42.360 --> 27:44.240]  That's what they're doing.
[27:44.240 --> 27:47.440]  UK police chief says authorities need to stop wasting time
[27:47.440 --> 27:49.320]  and that's getting people being offended.
[27:49.320 --> 27:50.480]  Yeah, I think so.
[27:50.480 --> 27:54.800]  Beyonce canceled by world word police
[27:54.800 --> 27:56.800]  for saying the word spaz.
[27:56.800 --> 27:59.240]  Oh, now that's me, people that have convulsions.
[27:59.240 --> 28:02.800]  Premier League footballers likely to stop taking a knee for BLM.
[28:02.800 --> 28:06.880]  Yeah, it's the old thing of the time now.
[28:06.880 --> 28:08.480]  It's the old trendy thing.
[28:08.480 --> 28:10.400]  Trans cheerleader faces assault charges
[28:10.400 --> 28:12.880]  for choking out female teammate
[28:12.880 --> 28:15.040]  who called him a man with a penis.
[28:16.760 --> 28:18.480]  And other key reports like the mean police
[28:18.480 --> 28:21.840]  on infowars.com.
[28:21.840 --> 28:23.000]  But that's just some of the news.
[28:23.000 --> 28:26.800]  We're gonna come back and hit some of the primary
[28:26.800 --> 28:29.040]  election news that's happening today
[28:29.040 --> 28:30.800]  and some of the energy being turned off
[28:30.800 --> 28:32.600]  and some of the admissions that
[28:32.600 --> 28:35.080]  this is going to collapse society by design.
[28:35.080 --> 28:37.040]  Pelosi has arrived.
[28:37.040 --> 28:41.200]  Toddling off like Skeletor's wife from the aircraft.
[28:42.200 --> 28:47.200]  In Taiwan as both sides line up for war and saber rattle.
[28:48.160 --> 28:50.520]  We'll be right back infowars.com.
[28:50.520 --> 28:52.160]  Tomorrow's news today.
[28:53.080 --> 28:55.040]  They end up video for all the censored videos.
[28:55.040 --> 28:57.040]  Hopefully you'll go there and share them.
[29:00.080 --> 29:01.920]  Info Wars has been vindicated.
[29:01.920 --> 29:03.160]  We've been proven right.
[29:03.160 --> 29:05.920]  World government, the new world order is out of the open.
[29:05.920 --> 29:09.800]  And now more than ever, the forces of Satan
[29:09.800 --> 29:11.960]  are trying to shut down this broadcast.
[29:11.960 --> 29:15.080]  The forces of anti-human, godless new world order
[29:15.080 --> 29:16.280]  are out of control.
[29:16.280 --> 29:19.800]  So now realize we have pushed them out of the light.
[29:19.800 --> 29:21.000]  We have pushed them out in the open
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.360]  and they are so upset and they are so scared.
[29:23.360 --> 29:24.880]  So while you still can,
[29:24.880 --> 29:26.640]  because any day can be our last broadcast,
[29:26.640 --> 29:28.120]  spread the word about the show,
[29:28.120 --> 29:29.480]  share the article, share the videos
[29:29.480 --> 29:32.160]  and please fund us while getting great products
[29:32.160 --> 29:35.600]  at the same time at infowarsstore.com.

[29:46.640 --> 29:49.000]  But whatever you do, pray for justice
[29:49.000 --> 29:51.480]  and pray for freedom and pray for the children
[29:51.480 --> 29:54.320]  and pray for free speech and justice to win.
[29:54.320 --> 29:55.880]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[29:55.880 --> 29:57.280]  I'll spread the word my friends.
[29:57.280 --> 29:59.720]  We're involved in an epic historic battle.
[29:59.720 --> 30:03.520]  The globalist great reset or the war for the world is here.
[30:03.520 --> 30:06.080]  But humanity is not being caught flat footed
[30:06.080 --> 30:09.520]  because of info wars and because of your support.
[30:09.520 --> 30:12.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now more important than ever
[30:12.480 --> 30:15.400]  as we reach the critical heart of the battle
[30:15.400 --> 30:18.360]  that you spread the word and that you support liberty

[33:00.680 --> 33:05.280]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[33:05.280 --> 33:06.520]  it's Alex Jones.
[33:16.920 --> 33:19.400]  Another move.
[33:19.400 --> 33:22.360]  Another time.
[33:22.360 --> 33:23.360]  The age of wonder.
[33:27.360 --> 33:30.360]  Another word.
[33:30.360 --> 33:32.360]  Another time.
[33:32.360 --> 33:37.840]  His eyes will scream and bleed until the crystal cracked.
[33:37.840 --> 33:40.360]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[33:40.360 --> 33:42.360]  you are the Resistance.
[33:42.360 --> 33:47.200]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide,
[33:47.200 --> 33:50.640]  it's Alex Jones.
[33:50.640 --> 33:52.560]  All right, I'm going to hit a lot of news right now,
[33:52.560 --> 33:55.320]  but I want to be very, very clear about something.
[33:55.320 --> 34:00.960]  All these different pieces, all these different programs
[34:00.960 --> 34:05.960]  of destabilization are just that.
[34:05.960 --> 34:10.000]  Part of the larger control demolition
[34:10.000 --> 34:12.040]  of human civilization.
[34:12.040 --> 34:14.960]  The globalists admit they're attacking civilization.
[34:14.960 --> 34:19.000]  They admit they're involved in this transition
[34:19.000 --> 34:21.040]  that they've been discussing.
[34:21.040 --> 34:25.760]  And this transition is, again, to bring us absolutely
[34:25.760 --> 34:28.000]  to our knees.
[34:28.000 --> 34:31.240]  So I can sit up here and show you Democrats acting like idiots
[34:31.240 --> 34:32.760]  and show you falling on their face
[34:32.760 --> 34:36.920]  and make fun of them like most conservative talk radio does.
[34:36.920 --> 34:39.480]  But those are just the front people.
[34:39.480 --> 34:42.240]  And we're meant to laugh at them while the real power
[34:42.240 --> 34:47.440]  behind the scenes is dismantling our lives.
[34:47.440 --> 34:49.720]  Now I want to give people hope.
[34:49.720 --> 34:51.840]  As you know, there are a lot of world leaders stepping up
[34:51.840 --> 34:53.280]  and speaking out.
[34:53.280 --> 34:56.040]  There are a lot of leaders hopping up around the world
[34:56.040 --> 34:59.400]  in different regions, in different subsections of nations.
[34:59.400 --> 35:01.120]  There's a lot of religious leaders standing up,
[35:01.120 --> 35:02.920]  a lot of business leaders standing up.
[35:02.920 --> 35:06.480]  People are starting to really discover the great reset
[35:06.480 --> 35:07.400]  and the new world order.
[35:07.400 --> 35:12.840]  And there's a lot of examples of that.
[35:12.840 --> 35:19.440]  The Supreme Court a month ago came out and ruled
[35:19.440 --> 35:26.600]  that you can't have the EPA for now 30 years just shut down
[35:26.600 --> 35:29.560]  70-plus percent of our coal power plants
[35:29.560 --> 35:33.040]  by saying carbon dioxide is illegal.
[35:33.040 --> 35:34.000]  That's what they say.
[35:34.000 --> 35:36.320]  To produce carbon dioxide is illegal out of a coal power
[35:36.320 --> 35:38.520]  plant, when it's totally good for the environment.
[35:38.520 --> 35:39.760]  You can't make law.
[35:39.760 --> 35:42.720]  Stop it.
[35:42.720 --> 35:43.400]  Well, guess what?
[35:46.200 --> 35:50.920]  The globalist-controlled EPA is still going along with it.
[35:50.920 --> 35:52.560]  And Biden has said he's not going to follow
[35:52.560 --> 35:53.600]  the Supreme Court ruling.
[35:56.120 --> 35:57.560]  So when they want to follow a ruling,
[35:57.560 --> 35:58.120]  they follow it.
[35:58.120 --> 36:00.120]  When they don't want to, they don't.
[36:00.120 --> 36:04.320]  Just like in Texas and just like in Connecticut,
[36:04.320 --> 36:08.360]  both judges said, if Alex Jones files for bankruptcy
[36:08.360 --> 36:09.920]  and remands this to federal court,
[36:09.920 --> 36:12.240]  we're going to go ahead with the trials.
[36:12.240 --> 36:16.240]  That's violation of federal law on its face, not debated.
[36:16.240 --> 36:18.680]  In Texas, we said we'll allow it to go forward,
[36:18.680 --> 36:21.280]  but we've got to get into the protection of bankruptcy,
[36:21.280 --> 36:24.240]  because you people admit your plan is to bankrupt us
[36:24.240 --> 36:26.120]  and destroy us and silence us.
[36:26.120 --> 36:32.600]  Not help these parents that they have manipulated into being
[36:32.600 --> 36:34.760]  part of this anti-First Amendment,
[36:34.760 --> 36:38.240]  anti-Second Amendment attack.
[36:38.240 --> 36:39.760]  Oh, and I got to say this.
[36:39.760 --> 36:43.440]  I've now met Neil Haslund and his ex-wife.
[36:43.440 --> 36:46.520]  Those people are real once I saw them in person.
[36:46.520 --> 36:47.480]  A lot of anomalies.
[36:47.480 --> 36:48.720]  The government lies so much.
[36:48.720 --> 36:50.240]  We have a right to question things.
[36:50.240 --> 36:52.000]  I thought Justice Smollett was a lie.
[36:52.000 --> 36:53.200]  I said it first.
[36:53.200 --> 36:54.080]  Went out on a limb.
[36:54.080 --> 36:55.480]  I was right.
[36:55.480 --> 36:57.040]  Most of the time, I'm right.
[36:57.040 --> 36:58.040]  We saw anomalies.
[36:58.040 --> 36:59.960]  I wasn't the first to bring up the anomalies.
[36:59.960 --> 37:01.560]  Some of the anomalies are going to be a fraud.
[37:01.560 --> 37:05.880]  I've spent days literally seven feet, eight
[37:05.880 --> 37:08.000]  feet away from Haslund, because we're sitting right there.
[37:08.000 --> 37:09.000]  They're sitting right there.
[37:09.000 --> 37:10.800]  That guy's real.
[37:10.800 --> 37:15.960]  And I thought it was an act when I saw some of the stuff
[37:15.960 --> 37:18.760]  on TV, just because he came off as so.
[37:23.960 --> 37:29.920]  Let's just say he's a nice man, and it's not an act.
[37:29.920 --> 37:34.640]  He is being manipulated by some very bad people.
[37:34.640 --> 37:36.520]  I'll just say it, because I've got to be honest.
[37:36.520 --> 37:38.840]  He's slow, OK?
[37:38.840 --> 37:41.320]  And his ex-wife is not.
[37:41.320 --> 37:42.880]  And I don't think he's stupid.
[37:42.880 --> 37:46.200]  I'm just saying I've got family members that
[37:46.200 --> 37:48.120]  are really smart in a lot of ways,
[37:48.120 --> 37:51.080]  but they're just real kind of quiet and have this way about
[37:51.080 --> 37:54.520]  them, and they move at a different pace.
[37:54.520 --> 37:57.360]  Like, they're fast in some ways and slow in others.
[37:57.360 --> 38:02.400]  And he's, I mean, I think Haslund acts like somebody
[38:02.400 --> 38:03.640]  on the spectrum.
[38:03.640 --> 38:06.480]  And it makes me feel like an even bigger jerk.
[38:06.480 --> 38:07.720]  But when I saw him, I'm like, there's
[38:07.720 --> 38:08.680]  something about this guy.
[38:08.680 --> 38:09.920]  This doesn't look.
[38:09.920 --> 38:11.720]  And now that I've been around him for over a week,
[38:11.720 --> 38:14.480]  I'm like, OK, now I know.
[38:14.480 --> 38:16.920]  And folks, I don't have some calculated point
[38:16.920 --> 38:18.040]  just to bring that up here.
[38:18.040 --> 38:20.880]  It's just that I'm around these people, and I'm looking at it,
[38:20.880 --> 38:23.640]  and I'm watching what's being said and what's going on.
[38:23.640 --> 38:28.520]  And it really then makes it clear what happened.
[38:28.520 --> 38:30.280]  I didn't watch a lot of the court yesterday,
[38:30.280 --> 38:32.440]  because I was busy getting ready for my own testimony
[38:32.440 --> 38:35.920]  and trying to re-research all the stuff they're going to ask me.
[38:35.920 --> 38:38.840]  And I said I'd get the news.
[38:38.840 --> 38:43.640]  And my lawyers get over here to the office.
[38:43.640 --> 38:45.760]  They're like six o'clock to meet with me.
[38:45.760 --> 38:49.960]  And they go, guess how the day went?
[38:49.960 --> 39:02.480]  And basically, without even watching the trial,
[39:02.480 --> 39:03.880]  I said, this is what happened today, right?
[39:03.880 --> 39:05.640]  And they said, yeah, so you've been watching?
[39:05.640 --> 39:10.080]  And I said, no, I just now have such clear sight
[39:10.080 --> 39:14.920]  into all this stuff that I'm not even a victim of it.
[39:18.000 --> 39:19.520]  I'm more like a fly on the wall.
[39:19.520 --> 39:22.440]  And it's fascinating at this point.
[39:22.440 --> 39:26.840]  It's just fascinating to see how the scammers work
[39:26.840 --> 39:29.640]  and to see how ambulance chasers work
[39:29.640 --> 39:31.320]  and to see how the Democratic Party works.
[39:31.320 --> 39:33.160]  And that's really what the Democratic Party is,
[39:33.160 --> 39:36.920]  is a bunch of ambulance chasers that then get into government
[39:36.920 --> 39:39.440]  who work for the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers,
[39:39.440 --> 39:44.040]  who are just mad scientists, crazed super brains.
[39:44.040 --> 39:48.520]  But the ambulance chaser Joe Biden types of the world
[39:48.520 --> 39:54.720]  are, though, like the flypaper that we get caught in.
[39:54.720 --> 39:59.640]  They're the curse that the deep state puts on us
[39:59.640 --> 40:03.680]  to sabotage our nation and bring us down.
[40:03.680 --> 40:06.720]  And so I can really see how the sausage is getting made.
[40:09.520 --> 40:15.600]  And if my asking questions about public events
[40:15.600 --> 40:18.680]  hurt these people's feelings, I'm sorry.
[40:22.280 --> 40:24.800]  And the most important point is this.
[40:24.800 --> 40:27.760]  I didn't knowingly promote Sandy Hook questions
[40:27.760 --> 40:28.920]  for ratings or listeners.
[40:28.920 --> 40:30.360]  I cover whatever I want.
[40:30.360 --> 40:31.760]  And I barely covered it.
[40:31.760 --> 40:34.920]  The Democratic Party, the corporate media, these judges
[40:34.920 --> 40:36.320]  are prepping for the cameras.
[40:36.320 --> 40:37.760]  They're all over the news.
[40:37.760 --> 40:39.920]  They're pushing their anti-free speech agenda.
[40:39.920 --> 40:47.560]  And they love every single second of this stuff.
[40:47.560 --> 40:50.960]  They are just living off Sandy Hook
[40:50.960 --> 40:55.720]  and keeping Sandy Hook alive by attaching it to me.
[40:55.720 --> 40:58.760]  And then constantly running hundreds of articles a day
[40:58.760 --> 41:03.680]  for years, sometimes thousands, calling me the Sandy Hook man
[41:03.680 --> 41:10.080]  until the point of I'm sitting there talking
[41:10.080 --> 41:12.840]  to a group of people outside the courtroom.
[41:12.840 --> 41:16.920]  And there's some other lawyers there.
[41:16.920 --> 41:19.080]  And I'm sitting there and I go, yeah, they don't think
[41:19.080 --> 41:21.480]  Adam Lanza did it.
[41:21.480 --> 41:22.680]  They think I did it.
[41:22.680 --> 41:25.440]  And one of these lawyers that's a well-known lawyer, not
[41:25.440 --> 41:27.400]  one of my lawyers, but was there to watch,
[41:27.400 --> 41:30.560]  goes, who's Adam Lanza?
[41:30.560 --> 41:35.000]  This is on Friday, who is Adam Lanza?
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  And we all just looked at him.
[41:37.000 --> 41:38.920]  We're like, exactly, who's Adam Lanza?
[41:38.920 --> 41:42.520]  You don't think Adam Lanza, when you think Sandy Hook,
[41:42.520 --> 41:44.520]  you think Alex Jones.
[41:44.520 --> 41:47.480]  And that's what they've put on me and made me and then
[41:47.480 --> 41:49.840]  claim I'm famous from it and claim
[41:49.840 --> 41:51.400]  I'm making money off of it.
[41:51.400 --> 41:55.920]  When our listeners don't want to hear about it, they tune out.
[41:55.920 --> 41:58.400]  But you have to understand, the president they're
[41:58.400 --> 42:01.520]  setting on January 6 is designed to come after your freedom.
[42:01.520 --> 42:04.280]  The president happening to me is designed to come after your freedom.
[42:04.280 --> 42:06.720]  This is the beta test.
[42:06.720 --> 42:08.240]  And this is what they're doing.
[42:08.240 --> 42:09.640]  I'm going to stop ranting.
[42:09.640 --> 42:12.240]  I need to hit the energy news, the military news,
[42:12.240 --> 42:14.080]  the stuff going on with Pelosi.
[42:14.080 --> 42:17.000]  I'll give you my take on that and so much more.
[42:17.000 --> 42:20.960]  And then we're going to have Robert Barnes, Owen Schroyer,
[42:20.960 --> 42:22.600]  and others here in studio.
[42:22.600 --> 42:26.520]  I also hope listeners understand that Info Wars really
[42:26.520 --> 42:28.160]  is fighting for its life.
[42:28.160 --> 42:31.640]  And we have a plan and a system where
[42:31.640 --> 42:34.720]  we'll be able to stay on the air indefinitely
[42:34.720 --> 42:36.240]  if you will just continue to support.
[42:36.240 --> 42:40.240]  But we need folks that want to not let the globalist break
[42:40.240 --> 42:43.800]  our will, break your will, and keep this operation on air
[42:43.800 --> 42:47.120]  to go to infowarstore.com right now
[42:47.120 --> 42:48.560]  and get vitamin mineral fusion.
[42:48.560 --> 42:50.480]  It's so good for your immune system, your whole body,
[42:50.480 --> 42:52.720]  all the vitamins, all the minerals, the amino acids.
[42:52.720 --> 42:55.200]  And it funds the Info War, a 360 win.
[42:55.200 --> 42:59.520]  Get your vitamin mineral fusion at infowarstore.com.
[42:59.520 --> 43:01.360]  Info Wars has been vindicated.
[43:01.360 --> 43:02.600]  We've been proven right.
[43:02.600 --> 43:05.360]  World government, the New World Order, is out of the open.
[43:05.360 --> 43:09.240]  And now more than ever, the forces of Satan
[43:09.240 --> 43:11.400]  are trying to shut down this broadcast.
[43:11.400 --> 43:14.520]  The forces of anti-human, godless New World Order
[43:14.520 --> 43:15.720]  are out of control.
[43:15.720 --> 43:19.200]  So now realize, we have pushed them out of the light.
[43:19.200 --> 43:20.480]  We have pushed them out in the open.
[43:20.480 --> 43:22.800]  And they are so upset, and they are so scared.
[43:22.800 --> 43:26.040]  So well, you still can, because any day can be our last broadcast.
[43:26.040 --> 43:28.200]  Spread the word about the show, share the article,
[43:28.200 --> 43:30.680]  share the videos, and please fund us
[43:30.680 --> 43:32.480]  while getting great products at the same time
[43:32.480 --> 43:34.960]  at infowarstore.com.
[43:34.960 --> 43:38.040]  Books, films, t-shirts, great supplements,
[43:38.040 --> 43:41.240]  vitamin mineral fusion, body sales maturmeric formula,
[43:41.240 --> 43:46.000]  Ultra 12, diet for so much more right now at infowarstore.com.
[43:46.000 --> 43:49.560]  But whatever you do, pray for justice, and pray for freedom,
[43:49.560 --> 43:52.440]  and pray for the children, and pray for free speech,
[43:52.440 --> 43:53.760]  and pray for justice to win.
[43:53.760 --> 43:55.320]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[43:55.320 --> 43:56.720]  I'll spread the word, my friends.
[43:56.720 --> 43:59.520]  We're involved in an epic, historic battle.
[43:59.520 --> 44:02.600]  We brought the game-changing product, previously only
[44:02.600 --> 44:05.080]  available to major oil companies around the world
[44:05.080 --> 44:08.160]  to the civilian market two years ago, the BioProse.
[44:08.160 --> 44:11.280]  For septic tanks, for porta-potties, for RVs,
[44:11.280 --> 44:13.880]  for your drains, your boats, it goes on and on.
[44:13.880 --> 44:17.280]  It'll eat the oil off of your driveway if you just add water.
[44:17.280 --> 44:21.000]  But it's been so successful now, we're selling it to major RV
[44:21.000 --> 44:26.080]  parks, pig farms, you name it, because this stuff will eat
[44:26.080 --> 44:28.600]  anything that is organic.
[44:28.600 --> 44:32.800]  And it's exclusively available at thebioprose.com,
[44:32.800 --> 44:35.000]  and now infowarstore.com.
[44:35.000 --> 44:37.280]  We sold out of this for almost a year,
[44:37.280 --> 44:39.480]  but we made a major purchase, and it
[44:39.480 --> 44:43.880]  is now in stock for whatever your need is at infowarstore.com.
[44:43.880 --> 44:46.560]  You'll also find instructional videos and more information
[44:46.560 --> 44:50.400]  at infowarstore.com or thebioprose.com.
[44:50.400 --> 44:54.360]  Made America, powered by God's great creation,
[44:54.360 --> 44:56.200]  it is amazing, and it funds the infowar.
[44:59.320 --> 45:01.960]  Seven months ago, in December of 2021,
[45:01.960 --> 45:05.120]  we launched the first in the three-coin founding member
[45:05.120 --> 45:08.160]  series, George Washington slaying the dragon.
[45:08.160 --> 45:10.160]  Then we launched the Tree of Liberty coin,
[45:10.160 --> 45:12.640]  and finally, the Second Amendment comment-ticket
[45:12.640 --> 45:14.120]  Molan Lobby coin.
[45:14.120 --> 45:19.960]  There are only 75 coins left in the three-point series,
[45:19.960 --> 45:24.960]  exclusively right now, at 1776.coin.com.
[45:24.960 --> 45:28.480]  And for the final 75 people to become founding members
[45:28.480 --> 45:30.760]  for this big project we're launching in the near future,
[45:30.760 --> 45:33.480]  you'll also get a personal signed piece of art
[45:33.480 --> 45:36.240]  I made of the sheepdog chasing the wolf
[45:36.240 --> 45:37.560]  and a personal message.
[45:37.560 --> 45:43.880]  It's your last chance to get all three coins at 1776.coin.com.
[45:43.880 --> 45:46.000]  This is history happening now.
[45:46.000 --> 45:48.960]  Infowarstore support is changing the world,
[45:48.960 --> 45:52.640]  and this is the final 75 three-coin set,
[45:52.640 --> 45:59.480]  exclusively available at 1776.coin.com.
[45:59.480 --> 46:01.600]  Sold out for more than six months,
[46:01.600 --> 46:04.840]  our number one best seller is now back in stock.
[46:04.840 --> 46:08.520]  Vitamin mineral fusion, all the minerals, all the vitamins,
[46:08.520 --> 46:11.960]  all the key amino acids to turbocharge your immune system
[46:11.960 --> 46:14.720]  and make your body as healthy as it could possibly be.
[46:14.720 --> 46:16.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is our best-selling product
[46:16.760 --> 46:17.880]  because people love it.
[46:17.880 --> 46:19.040]  We first launched it four years ago.
[46:19.040 --> 46:20.400]  I was like, OK, it's another item.
[46:20.400 --> 46:22.480]  It's high-quality, vitamins, minerals, so it'll be great.
[46:22.480 --> 46:24.320]  People love it because it tastes great
[46:24.320 --> 46:27.200]  and they see the results, and it funds the info war.
[46:27.200 --> 46:29.440]  So sold out for more than six months,
[46:29.440 --> 46:33.400]  vitamin mineral fusion is now back in stock for a limited time

[46:47.680 --> 46:50.200]  and keep info wars on the air.
[46:50.200 --> 46:56.800]  Vitamin mineral fusion back in stock, 40% off at infowarstore.com.
[46:56.800 --> 46:57.640]  Vitamin mineral fusion.
[47:01.000 --> 47:05.560]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[47:05.560 --> 47:06.800]  it's Alex Jones.
[47:06.800 --> 47:28.640]  The New World Order
[47:28.640 --> 47:29.720]  I don't like Nancy Pelosi.
[47:32.200 --> 47:35.120]  But I think we shouldn't have abandoned Taiwan.
[47:35.120 --> 47:42.560]  Taiwan has an agreement to more formalized relations with China decades from now, but
[47:42.560 --> 47:49.920]  China is muscling in and taking over the country now, just like they did with Hong Kong.
[47:49.920 --> 47:58.400]  In fact, Taiwan's never really overtly agreed to let China take it over, but it's happening
[47:58.400 --> 47:59.640]  now.
[47:59.640 --> 48:05.200]  And that's where the government of Chiang Kai-shek ran in 1949 when the CIA backed Mao
[48:05.200 --> 48:08.080]  Xitong to take over.
[48:08.080 --> 48:12.960]  So Drudge Report has the headline, one giant step for freedom, Pelosi in Taiwan.
[48:12.960 --> 48:20.920]  I don't like Pelosi, and the woman is a total joke, and obviously been on the Chinese payroll
[48:20.920 --> 48:27.160]  for decades, the Communist Chinese payroll, but her move of going to Taiwan and standing
[48:27.160 --> 48:35.960]  up the Communist Chinese is obviously a stunt she's doing, probably ahead of Biden stepping
[48:35.960 --> 48:37.680]  down and her becoming president.
[48:37.680 --> 48:42.600]  She's directly in line.
[48:42.600 --> 48:46.040]  So this is a stunt.
[48:46.040 --> 48:51.200]  Stab Taiwan in the back with one hand, give them a bandaid with the other, but those saying
[48:51.200 --> 48:57.960]  we shouldn't anger China, those saying we should not stand up to China in the South
[48:57.960 --> 48:59.520]  China Sea are wrong.
[48:59.520 --> 49:04.640]  China doesn't have a claim on those islands all the way to the South by Vietnam and by
[49:04.640 --> 49:12.200]  nations like the Philippines and way up to the North, but they are claiming it.
[49:12.200 --> 49:18.880]  They've gone and attacked oil rigs just a few miles off the coast of Vietnam and had
[49:18.880 --> 49:21.240]  gun battles with people.
[49:21.240 --> 49:25.760]  I mean China is just running around stomping on everything.
[49:25.760 --> 49:31.280]  Now if the Russians were doing things like that, I'd say they were our enemies.
[49:31.280 --> 49:32.280]  They're not.
[49:32.280 --> 49:36.000]  NATO when started the war in Ukraine, Russia fought back against it.
[49:36.000 --> 49:37.000]  That's just a fact.
[49:37.000 --> 49:45.560]  I wish the war wouldn't have started, but now we have Putin and the UN chief in the same
[49:45.560 --> 49:52.160]  day warning the world is one step from nuclear annihilation.
[49:52.160 --> 49:56.400]  So the globalists are turning off the energy, collapsing the borders, preparing new lockdowns,
[49:56.400 --> 50:02.600]  starving the third world to death, collapsing the third world to flood the first world.
[50:02.600 --> 50:05.480]  Our governments are surveilling us.
[50:05.480 --> 50:08.360]  They're trying to shut down our free speech.
[50:08.360 --> 50:13.600]  We have a case of tyranny and it's bad.
[50:13.600 --> 50:20.720]  And it makes me ask the question to all of you out there watching and listening.
[50:20.720 --> 50:23.560]  What are we all going to do?
[50:23.560 --> 50:25.880]  I intend to be here for the full show tomorrow.
[50:25.880 --> 50:28.760]  I'm sorry about having to be in court.
[50:28.760 --> 50:34.000]  They're trying to get me up there for months in Connecticut.
[50:34.000 --> 50:39.000]  That's why we did the bankruptcies because we don't have the money to do three trials
[50:39.000 --> 50:40.000]  at once.
[50:40.000 --> 50:44.320]  And because I've got to be on air, we don't bring the funds in.
[50:44.320 --> 50:49.080]  And just separately, I'm almost resigned to all of this because we're now inside the
[50:49.080 --> 50:50.080]  new world order.
[50:50.080 --> 50:55.040]  Things are going to get so much progressively worse from here on out that I'm not going
[50:55.040 --> 50:56.520]  to hang up my hat.
[50:56.520 --> 51:01.440]  They're trying to make me stop because they know our credibility is exploding.
[51:01.440 --> 51:06.120]  But just at an instinctive level, I just want to go get my family ready.
[51:06.120 --> 51:07.360]  I enjoy talking to you every day.
[51:07.360 --> 51:08.360]  I enjoy being here.
[51:08.360 --> 51:10.680]  I love the crew, and I can't give up.
[51:10.680 --> 51:11.680]  I won't give up.
[51:11.680 --> 51:12.680]  I pledge not to.
[51:12.680 --> 51:15.840]  But the time's coming, folks, when we're going to all be off the air, they're going to launch
[51:15.840 --> 51:17.920]  a cyber attack, say Russia did it.
[51:17.920 --> 51:20.000]  There's probably going to be a nuclear war, OK?
[51:20.000 --> 51:22.160]  So I mean, I really believe that.
[51:22.160 --> 51:24.080]  And I'm wrong sometimes.
[51:24.080 --> 51:28.560]  But I think in your gut, you know, too, we are in trouble.
[51:28.560 --> 51:29.560]  We're all in great danger.
[51:29.560 --> 51:33.520]  I'm getting massive chills right now.
[51:33.520 --> 51:36.960]  We need to pray to God to forgive us and to repent.
[51:36.960 --> 51:42.840]  We need to seek God's face and ask God to heal us and heal our land.
[51:42.840 --> 51:44.080]  We need to have revival.
[51:44.080 --> 51:48.800]  And I don't mean the establishment church revival, where the churches don't do anything
[51:48.800 --> 51:51.320]  politically and sit on their hands.
[51:51.320 --> 51:57.680]  I mean, we need folks in the streets, decrying the system, calling it out for the satanic
[51:57.680 --> 51:59.000]  thing it is.
[51:59.000 --> 52:00.480]  World government's here.
[52:00.480 --> 52:03.320]  Market of the beast is being rolled out.
[52:03.320 --> 52:04.680]  They're turning off the energy.
[52:04.680 --> 52:07.040]  It's all happening.
[52:07.040 --> 52:12.880]  But I got to do this right now, because I meant to come on this hour and really plug
[52:12.880 --> 52:14.960]  up front because we need money.
[52:14.960 --> 52:15.960]  We have goals every day.
[52:15.960 --> 52:19.840]  So I want to give you a status report on Info Wars for all of you that love this broadcast
[52:19.840 --> 52:23.600]  and that built this broadcast and are really founders of what we've set up and what we've
[52:23.600 --> 52:24.600]  done.
[52:24.600 --> 52:32.080]  We have a lot of projects that haven't launched yet that are very past due, but will be going
[52:32.080 --> 52:33.080]  soon.
[52:33.080 --> 52:38.200]  We have a big book being number one, you see the film being number two.
[52:38.200 --> 52:42.480]  We don't make money off that other than DVD sales and a few bucks per book.
[52:42.480 --> 52:44.360]  And that doesn't come in for months.
[52:44.360 --> 52:50.120]  But we have a lot of other projects that are going to reach even more people with the truth
[52:50.120 --> 52:54.960]  that will also help fund the operation that are very close to launching.
[52:54.960 --> 53:01.240]  So we've got so much work to do and we're not going to give up, but we can give out,
[53:01.240 --> 53:02.740]  as I've said.
[53:02.740 --> 53:05.200]  And so there's different types of bankruptcy.
[53:05.200 --> 53:12.320]  The type of bankruptcy we're in is a reorganization to keep Info Wars going.
[53:12.320 --> 53:17.640]  And there is a plan and a very easy projection of being able to do that and not laying people
[53:17.640 --> 53:22.160]  off and not cutting back a bunch of stuff and staying on air and not letting the New
[53:22.160 --> 53:29.200]  York Times have what it wants with this headline, can Alex Jones be shut down by the Sandy
[53:29.200 --> 53:30.320]  Hook lawsuits?
[53:30.320 --> 53:33.040]  And they say that's their goal is to shut me down.
[53:33.040 --> 53:36.040]  They're all there saying that.
[53:36.040 --> 53:40.960]  And bankruptcy protection is there for companies that people are trying to destroy.
[53:40.960 --> 53:42.080]  And that's what this is.
[53:42.080 --> 53:45.480]  And they've said that's what this is because they're proud of it.
[53:45.480 --> 53:52.920]  Well, I will assure these people that if you hadn't messed with me and all the other persecution
[53:52.920 --> 53:57.160]  of other groups out there that's far worse than this, I was already planning six years
[53:57.160 --> 54:01.720]  ago to be phased out and off air by now, maybe doing a podcast and writing a book and making
[54:01.720 --> 54:02.720]  films.
[54:02.720 --> 54:05.200]  I've been doing talk radio 28 years.
[54:05.200 --> 54:10.960]  I enjoy it at certain levels, but it's time for a change now.
[54:10.960 --> 54:13.280]  You're trying to make me go away.
[54:13.280 --> 54:17.640]  No, never now, ever.
[54:17.640 --> 54:21.680]  Folks have got my commitment, but they could still win if we don't get the funds we need.
[54:21.680 --> 54:26.400]  So help us stay in the fight, keep yourself in the fight, keep us on the front lines.
[54:26.400 --> 54:28.840]  We can't do it without your help.
[54:28.840 --> 54:32.680]  Go to infowarstore.com right now and get vital mineral fusion.
[54:32.680 --> 54:35.560]  It's been sold out for more than half a year.

[54:37.040 --> 54:41.800]  It's so good for you and it's funding our operation.

[55:13.520 --> 55:15.480]  you know, under all the stress.
[55:15.480 --> 55:20.880]  But in just the last three months since the samples of Diet Force came in, doing less
[55:20.880 --> 55:24.160]  exercise than I was before, this stuff really works.
[55:24.160 --> 55:26.520]  I've lost 39 pounds.
[55:26.520 --> 55:27.520]  I haven't weighed in two weeks.
[55:27.520 --> 55:28.840]  I've been too busy.
[55:28.840 --> 55:35.120]  But my wife just last night, she said, man, especially in your arms and your back and
[55:35.120 --> 55:38.840]  your legs, you lost a lot of weight, still got your little pot belly.
[55:38.840 --> 55:41.560]  But she said, man, this is really working.
[55:41.560 --> 55:47.320]  So you can get Diet Force at infowarstore.com and look, look, look, it's simple.
[55:47.320 --> 55:50.080]  These people want to shut us down so they want to shut you down.
[55:50.080 --> 55:51.080]  They want to shut you up.
[55:51.080 --> 55:52.920]  They think they own you and control you.
[55:52.920 --> 55:54.040]  They are bullies.
[55:54.040 --> 55:55.360]  They are thugs.
[55:55.360 --> 55:58.200]  They are authoritarians.

[57:35.840 --> 57:41.280]  All right, second hour is coming up straight ahead and again, it's an information war.
[57:41.280 --> 57:43.760]  We're all in this together.
[57:43.760 --> 57:50.120]  Rolling over is not an option.
[57:50.120 --> 57:51.120]  Info wars has been vindicated.
[57:51.120 --> 57:53.120]  We've been proven right.
[57:53.120 --> 57:55.800]  World government, the new world order is out the open.
[57:55.800 --> 58:01.720]  And now more than ever, the forces of Satan are trying to shut down this broadcast.
[58:01.720 --> 58:06.160]  The forces of anti-human, godless new world order are out of control.
[58:06.160 --> 58:09.560]  So now realize we have pushed them out of the light.
[58:09.560 --> 58:13.160]  We have pushed them out in the open and they are so upset and they are so scared.
[58:13.160 --> 58:17.040]  So while you still can, because any day can be our last broadcast, spread the word about
[58:17.040 --> 58:21.760]  the show, share the article, share the videos and please fund us while getting great products

[58:41.160 --> 58:43.760]  and pray for free speech and justice to win.
[58:43.760 --> 58:47.400]  Thank you so much for joining us and we'll spread the word, my friends, we're involved
[58:47.400 --> 58:49.480]  in an epic, historic battle.
[58:49.480 --> 58:54.840]  The globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family, to destroy heterosexual
[58:54.840 --> 58:59.440]  relationships, to annihilate our marriages and the studies are all clear.
[58:59.440 --> 59:06.080]  The number one cause of marital splits is that there is problems in the bedroom and the number
[59:06.080 --> 59:09.800]  one issue men have is erectile dysfunction.
[59:09.800 --> 59:13.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes about this because they don't want people
[59:13.480 --> 59:15.920]  having lasting, good, loving relationships.
[59:15.920 --> 59:22.320]  They want to break up society and we are so excited to have the number one natural male
[59:22.320 --> 59:27.000]  enhancement pill in the world available as a major sponsor now.
[59:27.000 --> 59:33.840]  Go to TheIronPatriot.com today, TheIronPatriot.com and watch the instructional video, look at
[59:33.840 --> 59:36.880]  the science in yourself and then get a bottle of InstaHeart.

[59:40.880 --> 59:52.920]  problems in the bedroom, this also enhances it so again, get yours today at TheIronPatriot.com.
[59:52.920 --> 1:00:07.800]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:00:07.800 --> 1:00:14.360]  It's really hard for me to quantify even in my own mind just how desperate the situation
[1:00:14.360 --> 1:00:15.360]  is.
[1:00:15.360 --> 1:00:20.920]  They've already killed 64 million extra people, the UN estimates, and I agree with that number
[1:00:20.920 --> 1:00:23.560]  in the last two and a half years of lock-downs.
[1:00:23.560 --> 1:00:28.840]  I mean, when I see a Black Lives Matter thing on television or people kneeling for it, it
[1:00:28.840 --> 1:00:30.560]  makes my blood boil.
[1:00:30.560 --> 1:00:36.440]  The majority of that 64 million extra people that starved to death in the last 32 months
[1:00:36.440 --> 1:00:45.920]  or so were Black and so when I see some stupid leftist Black supremacists strutting around
[1:00:45.920 --> 1:00:50.800]  telling me how the Democratic Party is great, usually 10 to 1 liberals with them doing the
[1:00:50.800 --> 1:00:58.120]  same thing, literally just arrogantly posturing about how they're superior and anybody doesn't
[1:00:58.120 --> 1:01:04.080]  agree with them as racist and how the Left and their big corporations put on Blackface
[1:01:04.080 --> 1:01:09.520]  and use Black people as their spokespersons makes me want to throw up because let me tell
[1:01:09.520 --> 1:01:11.400]  you something, I'm not some virtuous singular.
[1:01:11.400 --> 1:01:18.120]  I'm not some great White Hope who loves the Africans and because I'm so good and I want
[1:01:18.120 --> 1:01:21.840]  to be their saviors while I don't want them to starve to death.
[1:01:21.840 --> 1:01:25.400]  I do care about them because they're human beings and they're made by God, just like
[1:01:25.400 --> 1:01:27.120]  I was.
[1:01:27.120 --> 1:01:32.320]  But I have empathy at a subconscious ingrained level because if they can kill them, they're
[1:01:32.320 --> 1:01:34.360]  going to kill me.
[1:01:34.360 --> 1:01:39.760]  You think they're going to kill 35 extra million Africans the last few years, starving their
[1:01:39.760 --> 1:01:45.320]  asses of death, you think you're safe, you think any of us are safe, they're getting
[1:01:45.320 --> 1:01:46.320]  away with that?
[1:01:46.320 --> 1:01:53.520]  Let me tell you, and I don't mean just safe for me and starving to death are killed,
[1:01:53.520 --> 1:01:59.320]  I mean God.
[1:01:59.320 --> 1:02:06.360]  You think God's going to sit here and watch us go along with the New World Order?
[1:02:06.360 --> 1:02:10.760]  Starving tens of millions of people to death, mainly children, and that God isn't going
[1:02:10.760 --> 1:02:16.160]  to remove the heads of protection from us so we get run over?
[1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:21.680]  See, I don't fear man and I don't fear the New World Order and I don't fear their attacks
[1:02:21.680 --> 1:02:23.680]  on me.
[1:02:23.680 --> 1:02:30.200]  But I'm scared of God and let me tell you, I'm real scared right now.
[1:02:30.200 --> 1:02:34.680]  Even though I've tried to be a good person, I can feel the judgment coming and I just
[1:02:34.680 --> 1:02:37.160]  want to get to the middle of nowhere fast.
[1:02:37.160 --> 1:02:45.400]  My instincts are get out of here, alert, evacuate, and my head is sirens whoop whoop whoop whoop
[1:02:45.400 --> 1:02:51.520]  and I see the arrogant judges and politicians and arrogant media, arrogant system laughing
[1:02:51.520 --> 1:02:57.680]  as the Titanic is sinking and they're on board.
[1:02:57.680 --> 1:03:06.320]  And the sirens are just whoop whoop whoop, alert, alert, evacuate, globalist self-destruct
[1:03:06.320 --> 1:03:13.920]  system activated, civilization imploding in T minus 24 months, I mean that's on the outside
[1:03:13.920 --> 1:03:16.800]  of this doesn't get reversed quickly.
[1:03:16.800 --> 1:03:20.360]  I'm just looking around at these giant crowds of people that are spoiled, rotten and dumbed
[1:03:20.360 --> 1:03:24.640]  down, white, black, old, young, Hispanic, you name it.
[1:03:24.640 --> 1:03:33.960]  These big mega cities are time bombs and I'm sitting here in the middle of one of the most
[1:03:33.960 --> 1:03:40.000]  evil cities on earth, Austin, Texas, taking over by the left and I'm just like man I'm
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:47.680]  not supposed to be here but I guess maybe I am to try to wake people up whoop man, all
[1:03:47.680 --> 1:03:51.560]  these people laughing at conservatives while we get persecuted, laughing at Christians while
[1:03:51.560 --> 1:03:56.040]  we get persecuted, laughing as our justice is taken, laughing as we get deplatformed
[1:03:56.040 --> 1:04:01.480]  and hurt, laughing as people starve to death, Bill Maher saying let's depopulate, well Bill
[1:04:01.480 --> 1:04:04.280]  Maher you go down to Africa and then you line those kids up and at least blow their head
[1:04:04.280 --> 1:04:09.000]  off like Joseph Mengele would do, you're worse than Joseph Mengele because you want somebody
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:14.320]  else to kill people for you, you don't actually get your hands dirty do you, you stinking
[1:04:14.320 --> 1:04:23.960]  worm, I never trusted Bill Maher, he comes around a little bit because the public didn't
[1:04:23.960 --> 1:04:27.960]  buy in the New World Order and didn't buy in lockdowns and he didn't like being locked
[1:04:27.960 --> 1:04:31.320]  up, he's at least got the common sense of that but then he goes out in public and he
[1:04:31.320 --> 1:04:37.840]  sees all the poor people and he just says man we all just kill all these folks, so there's
[1:04:37.840 --> 1:04:44.160]  more room for pampered Bill Maher to do it every once, Bill Maher, there's too many people,
[1:04:44.160 --> 1:04:47.960]  how about you get your bathtub and slit your wrist or shove a gun in your mouth and blow
[1:04:47.960 --> 1:04:51.600]  your brains out, I wish no harm upon you, I'm just saying there's too many people buddy,
[1:04:51.600 --> 1:04:59.800]  don't jump off a building, show us how it's done big man, info wars has been vindicated,
[1:04:59.800 --> 1:05:04.440]  we've been proven right, world government, the New World Order is out of the open and
[1:05:04.440 --> 1:05:10.880]  now more than ever the forces of Satan are trying to shut down this broadcast, the forces
[1:05:10.880 --> 1:05:16.960]  of anti-human, godless New World Order are out of control, so now realize we have pushed
[1:05:16.960 --> 1:05:20.720]  them out of the light, we have pushed them out in the open and they are so upset and
[1:05:20.720 --> 1:05:24.960]  they are so scared, so well you still can, because any day can be our last broadcast,
[1:05:24.960 --> 1:05:29.000]  spread the word about the show, share the article, share the videos and please fund
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  us while getting great products at the same time at infowarsstore.com, books, films, t-shirts,
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:41.680]  great supplements, vitamin real fusion, body cells and matrimonial formula, ultra 12, diet
[1:05:41.680 --> 1:05:47.400]  for so much more right now at infowarscore.com, but whatever you do, pray for justice and
[1:05:47.400 --> 1:05:52.440]  pray for freedom and pray for the children and pray for free speech and justice to win,
[1:05:52.440 --> 1:05:56.240]  thank you so much for joining us, I'll spread the word my friends, we're involved in an
[1:05:56.240 --> 1:06:03.240]  epic historic battle.
[1:06:26.240 --> 1:06:45.440]  Reputation's amazing, I will not let you down, you will be very very impressed I hope.
[1:07:07.440 --> 1:07:12.440]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[1:07:12.440 --> 1:07:16.440]  Move bitch, get out of the way.
[1:07:16.440 --> 1:07:22.440]  We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the American flag.
[1:07:22.440 --> 1:07:27.440]  Infowars helped to move the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[1:07:27.440 --> 1:07:30.440]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[1:07:30.440 --> 1:07:36.440]  I will not let you down, you'll be very very impressed I hope and I think we'll be speaking
[1:07:36.440 --> 1:07:37.440]  a lot.
[1:07:37.440 --> 1:07:39.440]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[1:07:39.440 --> 1:07:44.440]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[1:07:44.440 --> 1:07:54.440]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[1:07:54.440 --> 1:08:01.440]  The operating system of the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha families, which is the oldest bloodline of
[1:08:01.440 --> 1:08:06.440]  European bloodlines in the world in which all European bloodlines agree are their progenitors.
[1:08:06.440 --> 1:08:13.440]  Going back to their founder, Vlad the Impaler, Count Dracula is the recognized head of the
[1:08:13.440 --> 1:08:14.440]  entire dynasty.
[1:08:14.440 --> 1:08:19.440]  His Royal Highness, Prince Charles, who can trace his ancestry back to Romania's dark
[1:08:19.440 --> 1:08:21.440]  and distant past.
[1:08:21.440 --> 1:08:25.440]  The genealogy shows that I understand you from Vlad the Impaler, you see.
[1:08:25.440 --> 1:08:27.440]  So I do have a bit of a stake in the country.
[1:08:27.440 --> 1:08:28.440]  As it were.
[1:08:28.440 --> 1:08:33.440]  And so this house of the dragon that flies the dragon banner, the Dracool, rule the
[1:08:33.440 --> 1:08:39.440]  planet, just like Revelation tells us the dragon and it's allied with the other dragon,
[1:08:39.440 --> 1:08:45.440]  the chicoms, and its goal is feudalism, though the high tech overlay.
[1:08:45.440 --> 1:08:51.440]  We're developing through technology an ability for consumers to measure their own carbon
[1:08:51.440 --> 1:08:52.440]  footprint.
[1:08:52.440 --> 1:08:53.440]  What does that mean?
[1:08:53.440 --> 1:08:55.440]  That's where are they traveling?
[1:08:55.440 --> 1:08:56.440]  How are they traveling?
[1:08:56.440 --> 1:08:58.440]  What are they eating?
[1:08:58.440 --> 1:09:00.440]  What are they consuming on the platform?
[1:09:00.440 --> 1:09:04.440]  So individual carbon footprint tracker.
[1:09:04.440 --> 1:09:10.440]  They tuned we don't have it operational yet, but this is something that we're working on.
[1:09:10.440 --> 1:09:12.440]  Total biometric surveillance.
[1:09:12.440 --> 1:09:14.440]  We want to stop this epidemic.
[1:09:14.440 --> 1:09:17.440]  We need not just to monitor people.
[1:09:17.440 --> 1:09:21.440]  We need to monitor what's happening under the skin.
[1:09:21.440 --> 1:09:26.440]  And if you go back to the Aztecs or the ancient Chinese or the ancient Europeans or the ancient
[1:09:26.440 --> 1:09:28.440]  Africans, everybody behave the same.
[1:09:28.440 --> 1:09:34.440]  You had cycles and you would get cycles of society building up, developing technology,
[1:09:34.440 --> 1:09:39.440]  agrarian systems, developing towns and cities, and then the cults take over, the high priests
[1:09:39.440 --> 1:09:44.440]  take over, and they always use environmental reasons for the reason that they have to dominate
[1:09:44.440 --> 1:09:49.440]  and demand human sacrifices and control over the public.
[1:09:49.440 --> 1:09:54.440]  So the Illuminati is basically just an extension of the mystery religion system, the whole
[1:09:54.440 --> 1:09:56.440]  type of philosophy.
[1:09:56.440 --> 1:10:02.440]  Yes, it was a way of hoarding knowledge and power to a few special people.
[1:10:02.440 --> 1:10:06.440]  And how do they hoard the knowledge?
[1:10:06.440 --> 1:10:12.440]  Well, when I say knowledge, some of the knowledge is pseudo-knowledge, and some of the knowledge
[1:10:12.440 --> 1:10:19.440]  is actually scientific knowledge which enabled, for instance, Christopher Columbus to be certain
[1:10:19.440 --> 1:10:26.440]  that he could sail across the Atlantic and hit land.
[1:10:26.440 --> 1:10:31.440]  He was associated with the Knights Templars, which is one of these secret societies associated
[1:10:31.440 --> 1:10:33.440]  with the Illuminati.
[1:10:33.440 --> 1:10:38.440]  So you've got different types of knowledge, but some of the knowledge is actually bogus.
[1:10:38.440 --> 1:10:47.440]  It's just claimed so that they can get people to join whatever mystery religion they're trying to offer.
[1:10:47.440 --> 1:10:54.440]  And the UN and others at the Club of Rome in the 1960s, early 1960s, said we're going to bring back
[1:10:54.440 --> 1:10:57.440]  the superstition of the pagans.
[1:10:57.440 --> 1:11:00.440]  And we're going to teach people they're bad, and teach them they're evil, and teach them
[1:11:00.440 --> 1:11:04.440]  that they have to pay, and teach them that old people have to die and babies have to be killed
[1:11:04.440 --> 1:11:09.440]  because there's too many people, so that we have a barbarous civilization that's the opposite
[1:11:09.440 --> 1:11:14.440]  of the Renaissance and Christianity, but one that is kill and be killed.
[1:11:14.440 --> 1:11:18.440]  And we believe this is the natural system of survival of fitness, social Darwinism,
[1:11:18.440 --> 1:11:20.440]  and so we're going to bring this back.
[1:11:20.440 --> 1:11:24.440]  And that's the real system we're transitioning to now we hear about a transition.
[1:11:24.440 --> 1:11:32.440]  So they decided to get rid of that and replace it with the old authoritarian model of barbarism
[1:11:32.440 --> 1:11:40.440]  that has the exact same features, no matter what color you are or where your ancestors came from,
[1:11:40.440 --> 1:11:45.440]  humans act the same in these cycles over and over again.
[1:11:45.440 --> 1:11:56.440]  The satanic rituals that they carry out, which are horrendous traditional rituals, blood sacrifices,
[1:11:56.440 --> 1:12:05.440]  requires a certain level of insanity and dissociative ability.
[1:12:05.440 --> 1:12:14.440]  If you were a normal sane person and you had to participate in the higher level Illuminati rituals,
[1:12:14.440 --> 1:12:16.440]  you'd probably go crazy.
[1:12:16.440 --> 1:12:22.440]  It's absolutely essential that they maintain the bloodlines.
[1:12:22.440 --> 1:12:28.440]  These are religious sacraments to these people of power over you,
[1:12:28.440 --> 1:12:32.440]  and they don't like the fact you're straight and strong, they don't like the fact you're good,
[1:12:32.440 --> 1:12:36.440]  they don't like the fact you're hardworking, they don't like the fact you want justice,
[1:12:36.440 --> 1:12:40.440]  they want to hurt you, they want to dominate you to fill that empty spot in their heart.
[1:12:40.440 --> 1:13:09.440]  So we are getting closer to the midterms and of course the big concern that any thinking American has
[1:13:09.440 --> 1:13:13.440]  is voter integrity.
[1:13:13.440 --> 1:13:18.440]  And I think more and more as the days go by people are realizing there's no way Joe Biden got 81 million votes,
[1:13:18.440 --> 1:13:22.440]  there's no way that's a legitimate election in 2020.
[1:13:22.440 --> 1:13:31.440]  And so we learned about the Zucker Bucks, we learned about all the different shenanigans that the Democrats were up to,
[1:13:31.440 --> 1:13:34.440]  and now they have mobile voting vans.
[1:13:34.440 --> 1:13:41.440]  Let's check this one out, mobile voting vans in one of the states they stole the Democrats, that is, in Wisconsin.
[1:14:16.440 --> 1:14:20.440]  So he goes on to have the conversation, you guys can keep the B-roll going and just lower the audio,
[1:14:20.440 --> 1:14:29.440]  but this is real, and it is funded by Zuckerberg, and here's what they do,
[1:14:29.440 --> 1:14:38.440]  and we found this out from 2020, but I didn't know about the mobile van voting angle of this,
[1:14:38.440 --> 1:14:48.440]  but Zuckerberg and his wife take hundreds of millions of dollars on voting initiatives,
[1:14:48.440 --> 1:14:55.440]  and then of course all their voting initiatives are in areas that they know are blue areas,
[1:14:55.440 --> 1:14:59.440]  or areas where Democrats get most of the votes.
[1:14:59.440 --> 1:15:04.440]  So they spend hundreds of millions of dollars, and they take these mobile voting vans,
[1:15:04.440 --> 1:15:09.440]  and they take all these different, whatever they can do, because the mobile voting van isn't legal in every state,
[1:15:09.440 --> 1:15:14.440]  but where it is legal they send the mobile voting vans out to Democrat areas,
[1:15:14.440 --> 1:15:17.440]  and it's just massive vote harvesting is what it is.
[1:15:17.440 --> 1:15:21.440]  So Democrats go into the nursing homes to vote harvest,
[1:15:21.440 --> 1:15:26.440]  they get hundreds of millions of dollars from big tech companies and the Zuckerbergs
[1:15:26.440 --> 1:15:32.440]  to take voter drives into inner cities, and they convince everybody to vote Democrat,
[1:15:32.440 --> 1:15:35.440]  they take out the ballots, they tell them to vote Democrat.
[1:15:35.440 --> 1:15:46.440]  This is how they got tens of millions of votes in Atlanta, in Phoenix, in Detroit, in Philadelphia,
[1:15:46.440 --> 1:15:49.440]  and in Milwaukee, it's how they steal elections.
[1:15:49.440 --> 1:15:54.440]  And because Republicans are asleep at the wheel, they're probably going to do it again in the midterms.

[1:18:56.440 --> 1:19:02.440]  We are now living in the void, sliding towards collapse in the strange space
[1:19:02.440 --> 1:19:05.440]  between what we've known and what's to come.
[1:19:05.440 --> 1:19:10.440]  And right now, the most important thing to remember is don't panic.
[1:19:10.440 --> 1:19:14.440]  Stay calm because now is the time that we must get our bearings
[1:19:14.440 --> 1:19:17.440]  and steer the ship onto a safe sound course.
[1:19:17.440 --> 1:19:24.440]  There is nothing stopping we the people from making our own rules and building our own society.
[1:19:24.440 --> 1:19:30.440]  All we got to do is survive the crash and right now we still have time to prepare.
[1:19:30.440 --> 1:19:34.440]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero.
[1:19:34.440 --> 1:19:40.440]  It's time to convert it into hard assets now, including food, water and survival gear
[1:19:40.440 --> 1:19:43.440]  to keep us strong and at the ready.
[1:19:43.440 --> 1:19:47.440]  Go to preparedtoday.com for the essentials,
[1:19:47.440 --> 1:20:05.440]  storable foods, water filtration, first aid, power and more at preparedtoday.com.
[1:20:33.440 --> 1:20:41.440]  Well, it is the final countdown, but is it the final countdown on human freedom and independence and prosperity?
[1:20:41.440 --> 1:20:49.440]  Or is it the final countdown on globalism and human oppression worldwide?
[1:20:49.440 --> 1:21:02.440]  We are at a crossroads and the decisions we make now will determine where the future of humanity goes.
[1:21:02.440 --> 1:21:08.440]  Now, if you want a taste of the future under globalism, under corporate world government,
[1:21:08.440 --> 1:21:12.440]  under that tyranny, that authoritarianism, that totalitarianism,
[1:21:12.440 --> 1:21:16.440]  you look at COVID, you look at the COVID vaccine,
[1:21:16.440 --> 1:21:26.440]  and then now you look at the fear-mongering and the threats of lockdown due to monkeypox,
[1:21:26.440 --> 1:21:34.440]  which we know what it is, we know how people get it,
[1:21:34.440 --> 1:21:44.440]  and yet we're still going to act like everybody is at risk when we know that's not the case.
[1:21:44.440 --> 1:21:47.440]  Well, let's take a look at the whole picture.
[1:21:47.440 --> 1:21:59.440]  Think about the dangerous precedent set when a virus can be made in a lab by governments
[1:21:59.440 --> 1:22:04.440]  and by individual actors like Anthony Fauci when they can make a virus in a lab
[1:22:04.440 --> 1:22:08.440]  and then release it onto the world, whether you think it's intentional or not,
[1:22:08.440 --> 1:22:14.440]  they can make a virus in the lab, release it to the world, and then say, there is a pandemic,
[1:22:14.440 --> 1:22:19.440]  there is a contagion, there is a virus, we have to lock down.
[1:22:19.440 --> 1:22:23.440]  Well, you just gave that group unlimited power.
[1:22:23.440 --> 1:22:32.440]  You just gave that government unlimited power, and you've now given them the actual real-world experience
[1:22:32.440 --> 1:22:42.440]  of executing that power to set precedent to do it to you again, and that's what they did.
[1:22:42.440 --> 1:22:51.440]  Then they had their vaccine, an experimental vaccine that they could never get past animal testing
[1:22:51.440 --> 1:23:00.440]  because it killed so many animals, an experimental vaccine that wasn't even technically a vaccine by definition,
[1:23:00.440 --> 1:23:05.440]  so they changed the definition of vaccine and then called it a COVID vaccine,
[1:23:05.440 --> 1:23:14.440]  even though it is a nanotechnology, never been used on humans before,
[1:23:14.440 --> 1:23:21.440]  that goes into your DNA on a nanoscale and basically rewrites your immune system
[1:23:21.440 --> 1:23:25.440]  and can rewrite your DNA, and now we know about all the side effects.
[1:23:25.440 --> 1:23:30.440]  Oh, and by the way, it doesn't even stop you from getting COVID or spreading COVID,
[1:23:30.440 --> 1:23:32.440]  and now Biden has COVID again, they say.
[1:23:32.440 --> 1:23:38.440]  Biden's COVID sequel, back on the balcony, dog for company,
[1:23:38.440 --> 1:23:45.440]  gives his poor dog COVID, I guess, then, is that before or after he's biting everybody.
[1:23:45.440 --> 1:23:47.440]  So Biden's got COVID again, they say.
[1:23:47.440 --> 1:23:52.440]  Now, here was Donald Trump's response, pretty funny on Truth Social.
[1:23:52.440 --> 1:23:58.440]  Joe Biden's second bout of COVID, sometimes referred to as the China virus,
[1:23:58.440 --> 1:24:01.440]  was sadly misdiagnosed by his doctors.
[1:24:01.440 --> 1:24:05.440]  He instead has dementia but is happily recovering well.
[1:24:05.440 --> 1:24:10.440]  Joe is thinking of moving part-time to one of those beautiful Wisconsin nursing homes
[1:24:10.440 --> 1:24:14.440]  where almost 100% of the residents miraculously and for the first time in history
[1:24:14.440 --> 1:24:18.440]  had the strength and energy to vote, even if those votes were cast illegally.
[1:24:18.440 --> 1:24:21.440]  Get well soon, Joe.
[1:24:21.440 --> 1:24:24.440]  Joe Biden, four vaccines.
[1:24:24.440 --> 1:24:27.440]  What does he had COVID four times now?
[1:24:27.440 --> 1:24:32.440]  That vaccine's really working for Joe, isn't it?
[1:24:32.440 --> 1:24:36.440]  Now they're promoting the Pax Lovid that they're all probably invested in,
[1:24:36.440 --> 1:24:38.440]  standing to make more billions of dollars,
[1:24:38.440 --> 1:24:45.440]  just like they all did in their COVID investments and their vaccine investments.
[1:24:45.440 --> 1:24:50.440]  You lose your freedoms, you lose your prosperity, you lose your future,
[1:24:50.440 --> 1:24:55.440]  but Joe Biden and the politicians get rich and they gain everything.
[1:24:55.440 --> 1:24:59.440]  So they make a virus in a lab, they set the precedent to lock you down with it,
[1:24:59.440 --> 1:25:02.440]  they lied you about how deadly the virus is,
[1:25:02.440 --> 1:25:07.440]  they set the precedent to force inoculate you, doesn't even work,
[1:25:07.440 --> 1:25:10.440]  and then they can come back around with monkeypox,
[1:25:10.440 --> 1:25:13.440]  but before we even get there,
[1:25:13.440 --> 1:25:18.440]  it's incredible how we're just acting like these vaccines aren't causing mass deaths.
[1:25:18.440 --> 1:25:20.440]  It's actually quite tragic.
[1:25:20.440 --> 1:25:24.440]  University student dies of joy, dies of joy.
[1:25:24.440 --> 1:25:27.440]  After hearing he had passed exams with flying colors,
[1:25:27.440 --> 1:25:34.440]  okay, you read that headline, that's the first story published on Mirror,
[1:25:34.440 --> 1:25:37.440]  but it got picked up and they all ran with the headline, you say,
[1:25:37.440 --> 1:25:40.440]  student dies of joy, what dies of joy?
[1:25:40.440 --> 1:25:43.440]  Let's actually read the story.
[1:25:43.440 --> 1:25:52.440]  Student Mubarak Hussein Jalil suffered a heart attack
[1:25:52.440 --> 1:25:57.440]  and died in the hospital after passing his exams.
[1:25:57.440 --> 1:26:06.440]  Oh, oh, died from a heart attack.
[1:26:06.440 --> 1:26:13.440]  Died of joy, says the headline, died of heart attack, says the medical examiner.
[1:26:13.440 --> 1:26:18.440]  22-year-old college student dying of a heart attack, does that sound normal to you?
[1:26:18.440 --> 1:26:23.440]  All these college students forced to take the COVID vaccine?
[1:26:23.440 --> 1:26:28.440]  Sudden adult death syndrome, dozens of former NFL players dead,
[1:26:28.440 --> 1:26:32.440]  dozens of former college athletes dead, all the professional soccer players
[1:26:32.440 --> 1:26:37.440]  keeled over on the field, some never playing again,
[1:26:37.440 --> 1:26:41.440]  professional golfers having serious side effects on the vaccines,
[1:26:41.440 --> 1:26:45.440]  and we just sit here and act like it's not happening.
[1:26:45.440 --> 1:26:48.440]  They make COVID in a lab, it kills us.
[1:26:48.440 --> 1:26:53.440]  They make vaccines, it kills us.
[1:26:53.440 --> 1:26:59.440]  But see, Fauci's mad because he wants full authority over you.
[1:26:59.440 --> 1:27:01.440]  He wants total control.
[1:27:01.440 --> 1:27:06.440]  Fauci complains that Americans will not adhere to authorities.
[1:27:06.440 --> 1:27:09.440]  Yes, you must bow to the great Fauci.
[1:27:09.440 --> 1:27:12.440]  He makes viruses in labs that kill millions of people.
[1:27:12.440 --> 1:27:19.440]  He lies about drug treatments to gay people that kill tens of thousands of gay people.
[1:27:19.440 --> 1:27:21.440]  And they all knew it at the time.
[1:27:21.440 --> 1:27:23.440]  They made movies all about it.
[1:27:23.440 --> 1:27:29.440]  Pretty famous movie, came out, Dallas Buyers Club, all about Anthony Fauci killing gay people.
[1:27:29.440 --> 1:27:36.440]  Oh, but the lead actor in that, Matthew McConaughey, he'll come out and lecture you about guns.
[1:27:36.440 --> 1:27:39.440]  He'll come out and tell you how he wants to take your guns.
[1:27:39.440 --> 1:27:45.440]  But oh, he does a whole movie about how the U.S. government was killing gay people,
[1:27:45.440 --> 1:27:51.440]  and it was Anthony Fauci doing it, and Matthew McConaughey won't say boo about that.
[1:27:51.440 --> 1:27:55.440]  Matthew McConaughey, silent on that, does a whole movie on it,
[1:27:55.440 --> 1:28:00.440]  but then can't be bothered to talk about that in the real world.
[1:28:00.440 --> 1:28:03.440]  He'd rather talk about how he wants to take your guns.
[1:28:03.440 --> 1:28:07.440]  But Fauci, the guy that makes the viruses, Fauci, the guy that promotes the vaccines,
[1:28:07.440 --> 1:28:09.440]  Fauci, the guy that wants total authority.
[1:28:09.440 --> 1:28:15.440]  I mean, this is your real life.
[1:28:15.440 --> 1:28:22.440]  In living color, Dr. Mangala, 2022.
[1:28:22.440 --> 1:28:26.440]  Except it's Anthony Fauci.
[1:28:26.440 --> 1:28:28.440]  And he keeps flip-flopping, too.
[1:28:28.440 --> 1:28:31.440]  Oh, we don't need to lock down. We need lockdowns.
[1:28:31.440 --> 1:28:33.440]  I never said we needed lockdowns.
[1:28:33.440 --> 1:28:37.440]  By the way, I need authority to lock you down.
[1:28:37.440 --> 1:28:38.440]  That's Fauci.
[1:28:38.440 --> 1:28:40.440]  The vaccines will be safe and effective.
[1:28:40.440 --> 1:28:42.440]  Yeah, the vaccines aren't really working.
[1:28:42.440 --> 1:28:43.440]  That's Fauci.
[1:28:43.440 --> 1:28:46.440]  He's the highest-paid government employee.
[1:28:46.440 --> 1:28:50.440]  He makes hundreds of millions of dollars on the side, shadow money,
[1:28:50.440 --> 1:28:56.440]  and his pension is set to be more than half a million dollars if he ever decides to retire.
[1:28:56.440 --> 1:28:58.440]  Info wars has been vindicated.
[1:28:58.440 --> 1:28:59.440]  We've been proven right.
[1:28:59.440 --> 1:29:02.440]  World government, the New World Order is out of the open.
[1:29:02.440 --> 1:29:08.440]  And now, more than ever, the forces of Satan are trying to shut down this broadcast.
[1:29:08.440 --> 1:29:12.440]  The forces of anti-human, godless New World Order are out of control.
[1:29:12.440 --> 1:29:16.440]  So now, realize, we have pushed them out in the light.
[1:29:16.440 --> 1:29:20.440]  We have pushed them out in the open, and they are so upset, and they are so scared.
[1:29:20.440 --> 1:29:23.440]  So while you still can, because any day can be our last broadcast,

[1:29:54.440 --> 1:29:56.440]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[1:30:43.440 --> 1:30:44.440]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[1:30:44.440 --> 1:30:45.440]  I'll spread the word, my friends.
[1:30:45.440 --> 1:30:46.440]  We're involved in this.
[1:30:46.440 --> 1:30:47.440]  We're involved in this.
[1:30:47.440 --> 1:30:48.440]  We're involved in this.
[1:30:48.440 --> 1:30:49.440]  We're involved in this.
[1:30:49.440 --> 1:30:50.440]  We're involved in this.
[1:30:50.440 --> 1:30:56.440]  We're really a family of experienced people.
[1:30:56.440 --> 1:30:57.440]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[1:30:57.440 --> 1:30:58.440]  I'll spread the word, my friends.
[1:30:58.440 --> 1:31:00.440]  We're involved in an epic historic battle.
[1:31:00.440 --> 1:31:04.440]  If you're like myself and so many other people on this planet,
[1:31:04.440 --> 1:31:05.440]  especially as you get older,
[1:31:05.440 --> 1:31:08.440]  you ain't wait, even if you eat a lot less,
[1:31:08.440 --> 1:31:12.440]  but I gotta tell you,
[1:31:12.440 --> 1:31:14.440]  info war is only about bringing you amazing products that really work.
[1:31:14.440 --> 1:31:17.440]  So we looked at the supplement market
[1:31:17.440 --> 1:31:22.640]  products that are out there. We went and looked at the top 10 and they all have the same ingredients
[1:31:22.640 --> 1:31:29.520]  in common that is in this product. But with our new product from X7 diet force, we got the very

[1:31:37.280 --> 1:31:41.840]  And so I've lost almost 40 pounds. I'm so a little bit overweight in the last three months and I've
[1:31:41.840 --> 1:31:48.160]  been doing it using diet force and also exercise. Well now diet force is exclusively available right

[1:32:52.560 --> 1:33:01.440]  that's exclusively available at infowarstore.com leading a frontal assault on the lies of the
[1:33:01.440 --> 1:33:16.240]  New World Order. It's Alex Jones from the front lines of the information war. It's Owen Troyer.
[1:33:16.240 --> 1:33:32.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:35.200 --> 1:33:42.560]  So now three states, of course, all Democrat states that promote homosexuality and
[1:33:42.560 --> 1:33:52.320]  pride in it, pride in anal sex, pride and sodomy. And they've got all their gay clubs and gay bars
[1:33:52.320 --> 1:33:58.320]  that they promote to and the Democrat politicians go to them and dance and tell you how gay they are
[1:33:58.320 --> 1:34:18.240]  and how much they love pride. Oops. Now, if you can't see how this is direct karma in a very
[1:34:18.240 --> 1:34:30.240]  cosmic sense or in a very scientific and medical sense that you have pride month and pride parades
[1:34:30.240 --> 1:34:36.720]  all June long and then all July, what do you have? A gay STD going around called monkeypox
[1:34:36.720 --> 1:34:47.520]  that is pretty much 100% of the people getting monkeypox are gay. It's 99%. And then there's
[1:34:47.520 --> 1:34:55.920]  kids, there's a couple of kids that got monkeypox that quote had contact with gay individuals,
[1:34:55.920 --> 1:35:09.200]  children that quote had contact with gay individuals. So it's New York, it's Illinois
[1:35:09.200 --> 1:35:13.920]  and it's California. They've declared a state of emergency over monkeypox.
[1:35:15.520 --> 1:35:20.320]  In New York, they're saying 150,000 New Yorkers are at risk for monkeypox. Is that the amount of
[1:35:20.320 --> 1:35:27.360]  New Yorkers that are having anal sex and sodomizing one another at bathhouses and at orgies?
[1:35:28.320 --> 1:35:34.400]  Somehow I doubt that's the case. And you know, I'm really hesitant to even show you these images
[1:35:34.400 --> 1:35:41.680]  because they are really disturbing and disgusting. But it's now a monkeypox pride.
[1:35:41.680 --> 1:35:50.160]  And it's all these gay men, a lot of them known sex workers that promote orgy parties,
[1:35:50.160 --> 1:35:54.240]  gay orgy parties on their social media sites. I'm not even kidding you folks.
[1:35:55.600 --> 1:36:02.720]  It was not a fun investigative research project to go look at this, but they now do these videos
[1:36:02.720 --> 1:36:08.080]  where they do pride and monkeypox. And I'm sorry to be gross because I'm even getting sick.
[1:36:08.080 --> 1:36:12.240]  Like I'm not really a guy that gets squeamish. But I mean, this is pretty disgusting stuff.
[1:36:14.080 --> 1:36:21.120]  So you may not want to hear this, but I mean, it's dudes that show you their face.
[1:36:21.120 --> 1:36:26.080]  They show you where the monkeypox is. It's all around their mouth. I don't think I need to go
[1:36:26.080 --> 1:36:32.720]  into detail about what that is. And then in the videos where they're saying they have pride in
[1:36:32.720 --> 1:36:39.120]  their monkeypox, they say how it's on their mouth, on their genitals and around their anus. Now,
[1:36:40.080 --> 1:36:46.720]  again, I don't think I need to explain what's going on here. It's pretty obvious. And they've done
[1:36:47.920 --> 1:36:54.000]  the research on these cases. And it's 99% of the cases of monkeypox are gay men
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:37:01.840]  that are having homosexual anal intercourse with dozens of other partners at times.
[1:37:02.800 --> 1:37:04.800]  And they brag about it. They put it on social media.
[1:37:06.960 --> 1:37:13.760]  But now they want everybody. Everybody has to be in a state of emergency. Everybody has to go
[1:37:13.760 --> 1:37:22.640]  into lockdown because of this monkeypox virus, which is almost exclusively gay men that are having
[1:37:22.640 --> 1:37:34.640]  gay orgies. But see, oh, when it was COVID, everybody had to do what it took to stop the
[1:37:34.640 --> 1:37:40.480]  spread. Remember that? You're not essential. Your church is closed. Your business is closed.
[1:37:40.480 --> 1:37:44.480]  Everything else, remember? We're all on the team. Everybody's going to have to make the sacrifice.
[1:37:45.600 --> 1:37:51.200]  But now that it's monkeypox and we know exactly what's going on and we know exactly what's spreading
[1:37:51.200 --> 1:37:58.480]  it, we're not going to discourage the gay orgies. No, no, no, no, no. We're not going to discourage
[1:37:59.760 --> 1:38:05.440]  the sodomy continuing en masse. No, we're not going to, no, no, no, no, no, no. We're going to
[1:38:05.440 --> 1:38:09.840]  promote it and we're going to say that everybody needs to be shut down and locked down because
[1:38:09.840 --> 1:38:17.840]  monkeypox. But don't worry, the gay orgies must go on. Don't you see it's pride?
[1:38:17.840 --> 1:38:27.760]  So let me just say it. It's not a coincidence. It's not a coincidence that you had pride
[1:38:27.760 --> 1:38:33.680]  parades in June in the streets and that then you then had the pride parades in July,
[1:38:33.680 --> 1:38:40.880]  lining up at the doctor's offices, lining up at the hospitals, lining up at a monkeypox vaccine clinic.
[1:38:40.880 --> 1:38:51.120]  I think it's pretty obvious here, isn't it? No, that's not a coincidence. That's a direct result.
[1:38:53.040 --> 1:39:02.880]  You went around for an entire month engaging in sodomy with many men and now you've got monkeypox
[1:39:05.680 --> 1:39:10.160]  and it was all promoted by the establishment and it was all promoted by the Democrat party.
[1:39:10.160 --> 1:39:17.200]  This is horrific. If anything, see, if we were a serious country, if we were a serious civilization,
[1:39:17.200 --> 1:39:27.440]  we'd learn a lesson from this. And fine, we've got people out there that are atheists and okay,
[1:39:27.440 --> 1:39:31.200]  a separation of church and state. So we don't have to make this a cosmic thing.
[1:39:31.200 --> 1:39:37.520]  We don't have to say this is God punishing you. We won't go down that road. Let's just keep it
[1:39:37.520 --> 1:39:47.200]  medical. Let's keep it scientific. You promoted activities. You celebrated activities. You said
[1:39:47.200 --> 1:39:53.040]  to take pride in activities that caused the spread of a disease now called monkeypox that you've
[1:39:53.040 --> 1:39:59.600]  declared a state of emergency over. It's all a direct result of your actions and we all have
[1:39:59.600 --> 1:40:02.880]  to suffer and we have to pretend like we're ignorant and we don't know what's going on.
[1:40:02.880 --> 1:40:10.880]  And so now the new fearmongering is monkeypox is airborne. Remember they did that with COVID.
[1:40:10.880 --> 1:40:16.160]  The COVID is airborne and they showed you these wild graphics, just insane graphics like you
[1:40:16.160 --> 1:40:21.520]  would cough in a grocery store and it'd climb over 15 shelves and then go through the ventilation
[1:40:21.520 --> 1:40:26.480]  system and then everybody gets sick because you coughed at the grocery store. And now they're
[1:40:26.480 --> 1:40:31.440]  doing the same thing. Monkeypox is airborne and it's a top trend on Twitter probably forced in
[1:40:31.440 --> 1:40:35.040]  by the algorithms and it's a bunch of these weird accounts. I don't even know if these
[1:40:35.040 --> 1:40:38.720]  accounts are real but this is just the stuff that's going around getting a lot of shares.
[1:40:40.320 --> 1:40:47.200]  Monkeypox is airborne. Anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers don't care. It's all about their freedom.
[1:40:48.720 --> 1:40:52.240]  No, believe me, I'm not going to get a vaccine and I'm not going to get monkeypox.
[1:40:52.880 --> 1:40:55.760]  I can tell you that and I'm not going to get COVID either.
[1:40:55.760 --> 1:41:03.280]  Monkeypox is airborne. Social distancing must continue. Masks must continue. This is the new
[1:41:03.280 --> 1:41:10.240]  normal. Oh, because you promoted your whole Pride Month. You promoted all your disgusting
[1:41:10.240 --> 1:41:17.840]  degeneracy. You promoted all your disgusting sex out in the streets for kids and everything.
[1:41:17.840 --> 1:41:26.160]  And now you've got an STD for a month long of your sex capades. Now you've all got STDs
[1:41:26.160 --> 1:41:32.640]  and everyone else is to blame. It's everyone else's fault. We all have to lock down. We all have to
[1:41:32.640 --> 1:41:37.040]  say this is a pandemic. No, we know exactly what it is. But see, we're not a serious civilization
[1:41:37.040 --> 1:41:43.520]  anymore, are we? We're a clown world. And I'm not meaning to be insensitive here. People make mistakes.
[1:41:43.520 --> 1:41:48.640]  But can't you see we've made a big mistake? I mean, this should be the moment like we've made a big
[1:41:48.640 --> 1:41:55.280]  mistake here. We just promoted Pride Month for a whole month. You saw how degenerative it got.
[1:41:55.280 --> 1:41:59.920]  You saw how sorted the activities in the streets got in front of children. Now we have a monkeypox
[1:41:59.920 --> 1:42:06.960]  epidemic because of it. This is where serious civilizations, societies, cultures would check
[1:42:06.960 --> 1:42:13.680]  themselves before they wrecked themselves. But no, no, no, no, no, no. We really wrecked them,
[1:42:13.680 --> 1:42:24.240]  didn't we? Boy, did we wreck them. So there you go. They promote their pride. They promote their
[1:42:24.240 --> 1:42:30.720]  sodomy. They all get a disease. They all spread it. But now the rules change and everybody has to
[1:42:30.720 --> 1:42:38.080]  pay except the people that are responsible for spreading the disease. Yeah. Oh, and by the way,
[1:42:38.880 --> 1:42:47.840]  banana boat sunscreen recalled due to cancer causing chemical. And so the anti-sunscreen
[1:42:47.840 --> 1:43:00.800]  crowd wins again. The anti-seed oil crowd wins again. Sold out for seven months. Body's ultimate

[1:44:35.680 --> 1:44:39.520]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula, folks, this is a joke. I mean,
[1:44:39.520 --> 1:44:44.240]  we're giving this thing away. It's 75% off. By the way, it works for me. In case you haven't
[1:44:44.240 --> 1:44:51.840]  noticed, the hair and beard formula is working for me. Quite well, I might add. Quite well,
[1:44:51.840 --> 1:44:56.320]  my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men. I go and see him quite often now.
[1:44:56.960 --> 1:45:02.240]  We brought the game changing product previously only available to major oil companies around the
[1:45:02.240 --> 1:45:07.840]  world to the civilian market two years ago, the bio pros for septic tanks, for porta potties,
[1:45:07.840 --> 1:45:13.280]  for RVs, for your drains, your boats, it goes on and on. It'll eat the oil off of your driveway,
[1:45:13.280 --> 1:45:18.960]  you can just add water. But it's been so successful now, we're selling it to major RV parks,

[1:47:53.200 --> 1:47:58.880]  All right, so there's some major geopolitical news today. Let's lay it all out here.
[1:47:58.880 --> 1:48:08.240]  Now, I don't trust anything that the Biden administration says. I obviously don't trust
[1:48:08.240 --> 1:48:19.600]  the mainstream media at all either. And so I'm not saying that they didn't just kill Ayan Aiman
[1:48:19.600 --> 1:48:26.240]  Al-Zawahari, the al-Qaeda leader. I'm not saying that that didn't happen, but I am skeptical
[1:48:26.240 --> 1:48:33.200]  and there are some interesting little tidbits here that lead to my skepticism. First of all,
[1:48:35.600 --> 1:48:41.440]  Biden is desperate. His approval ratings are hitting all time lows. Job approval rating,
[1:48:41.440 --> 1:48:46.240]  economic approval rating, I mean just everything, overall approval rating, everything Biden is
[1:48:46.240 --> 1:48:53.280]  just tanking right now. Kamala Harris is already in the tank. And so the Democrats need something
[1:48:53.280 --> 1:48:58.640]  to prop Joe Biden up. They need something. So hey, let's kill a terrorist and say that Biden did it.
[1:48:58.640 --> 1:49:03.680]  We'll make him out to be a hero. Now I'm not buying that for a second. Now again, they might have
[1:49:03.680 --> 1:49:11.920]  actually killed him because here's the interesting story. Well, let's flash back. This is in 2020
[1:49:13.920 --> 1:49:16.880]  from the Brookings Institute, but by the way, this got covered everywhere.
[1:49:16.880 --> 1:49:24.560]  This is just the one I printed. From November 2020, the death of Aiman Al-Zawahari and the
[1:49:24.560 --> 1:49:34.240]  future of al-Qaeda, he was reported dead in November 2020. Now, when you read these stories,
[1:49:34.240 --> 1:49:39.280]  they admit that they can't confirm that he's dead because he hasn't been seen in years or whatever.
[1:49:40.480 --> 1:49:45.680]  So it was speculation that he was dead, but the headlines were reading that he was dead
[1:49:45.680 --> 1:49:56.480]  in November of 2020. Now what has happened since? Well, Biden got into office and then you had the
[1:49:56.480 --> 1:50:08.400]  disastrous Afghanistan pullout. And so it appears what has happened is that Zawahiri did go into
[1:50:08.400 --> 1:50:16.320]  hiding and was off the map. But after the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, which still, I mean,
[1:50:16.320 --> 1:50:23.680]  who knows the real story about that absolute disaster? Zawahiri was so comfortable in Kabul
[1:50:23.680 --> 1:50:28.720]  now that he was just hanging out. He was just hanging out doing his thing. And apparently,
[1:50:28.720 --> 1:50:36.240]  he was seen on a balcony. And that's what led to the drone strike that killed him as a, what was
[1:50:36.240 --> 1:50:45.280]  it, like maybe 12 hours ago or less? Al-Qaeda leader killed in drone strike. But then getting
[1:50:45.280 --> 1:50:50.880]  into the other angle of that, the story at the New York Post, Joe Biden lied about Afghan terror
[1:50:51.520 --> 1:50:58.720]  after Aiman Al-Zawahiri's death, GOP says. Republicans say the killing of Al-Qaeda,
[1:50:58.720 --> 1:51:04.880]  Kingpin Aiman Al-Zawahiri raises questions about whether President Biden's disastrous withdrawal
[1:51:04.880 --> 1:51:10.480]  from Afghanistan gave the Taliban free reign to allow the terror group to use the country as a base
[1:51:10.480 --> 1:51:20.880]  of operations once again. Duh. Duh. But now it's Republicans like Lindsey Graham saying, see,
[1:51:20.880 --> 1:51:26.400]  we need to go back to war with Al-Qaeda. We need to go back into Afghanistan.
[1:51:27.840 --> 1:51:31.520]  Boy, oh boy, these guys, they've never seen a war they didn't want you to die in.
[1:51:31.520 --> 1:51:35.440]  Lindsey Graham, he's never seen a war he didn't want to send your kid to die in.
[1:51:36.400 --> 1:51:39.280]  Sure, Lindsey, yeah, Afghanistan, Ukraine, what next?
[1:51:40.320 --> 1:51:44.480]  Taiwan? Where else are we going to send them? Russia? Where should we send them, Lindsey?
[1:51:44.480 --> 1:51:47.680]  Lindsey, where do you want to send Americans to die next, Lindsey Graham?
[1:51:49.440 --> 1:51:54.480]  What's your, what's your angle, Lindsey Graham? What country do you want to see Americans shed
[1:51:54.480 --> 1:51:59.840]  blood in next, Lindsey? You just love it, don't you? How much you got invested in the defense
[1:51:59.840 --> 1:52:07.600]  contractors, Lindsey Graham? So here's the deal. They obviously were tracking this guy for a while.
[1:52:08.720 --> 1:52:13.760]  They obviously were tracking him into Afghanistan. CIA is all over over there. Give me a break.
[1:52:14.400 --> 1:52:19.760]  They've been tracking, the guy probably worked for the CIA. Zawahiri probably worked for the CIA,
[1:52:19.760 --> 1:52:25.520]  but regardless, they knew where he was probably as soon as he got back into Afghanistan.
[1:52:25.520 --> 1:52:30.560]  And he felt so comfortable that he's just hanging out, smoking cigars on balconies, running around,
[1:52:30.560 --> 1:52:40.240]  thinking it's all over. I'm not being hunted anymore. And then the U.S. military now, now all in the
[1:52:40.240 --> 1:52:46.960]  tank for Biden. And the Democrats said, we got to do something to boost Biden's approval. We got to
[1:52:46.960 --> 1:52:51.760]  do something. Biden needs a good headline. He's got COVID again. He's hiding. We've got a recession.
[1:52:51.760 --> 1:52:57.760]  Everything's tanking. The crime rates, it's just a disaster. We got to give him something. Let's kill
[1:52:57.760 --> 1:53:04.800]  a terrorist and give him that win. And so they go shoot him down to give Biden the approval
[1:53:04.800 --> 1:53:09.600]  ratings boost, and it doesn't even work. He's not going to see a single point go up in his approval
[1:53:09.600 --> 1:53:17.520]  ratings, because to fight Frank with you, most people don't care about al-Zawahiri. And they can
[1:53:17.520 --> 1:53:24.000]  run the stories all day about the 9-11 families, and that's horrible, obviously. But most Americans
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:31.840]  don't care about al-Zawahiri. They just don't. They care about the fact the crime rates are skyrocketing.
[1:53:31.840 --> 1:53:36.080]  They care about the fact the education system is failing. They care about the fact that there's a
[1:53:36.080 --> 1:53:41.840]  recession. The energy prices are going up. That's what they care about, not al-Zawahiri and the
[1:53:41.840 --> 1:53:48.240]  deep state giving Joe Biden some sort of a fake victory, some sort of a fake win, like he had
[1:53:48.240 --> 1:53:53.280]  anything to do with the bombing of this guy. Joe Biden doesn't know what planet he's on.
[1:53:55.920 --> 1:54:02.320]  This is the deep state trying to give Joe Biden a win in a horrible time right now in this country's
[1:54:02.320 --> 1:54:10.000]  history because of his administration. But so that's what's going on. That's the bigger story.
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  Then you have Pelosi going to Taiwan. Now, I sat and thought about this because really it's the kind of
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:30.000]  stuff that starts larger wars. Oh, Pelosi's going to fly over there and have her plane down? Tell me how
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  that doesn't potentially start a larger war. Tell me how that doesn't seem like a giant setup. But the
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:41.520]  whole thing still screams of political theater. The whole thing still screams of geopolitical
[1:54:41.520 --> 1:54:47.120]  theater. The Biden administration has flip-flopped back and forth. They've said they stand with
[1:54:47.120 --> 1:54:51.120]  Taiwan. They've said they don't stand with Taiwan. They said their support with Taiwan would be on
[1:54:51.120 --> 1:55:00.000]  dying to saying we don't support Taiwan at all. And then there's Pelosi. Now, is Pelosi acting as an
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  independent actor here wanting to go to Taiwan just for her own ego? Let's not discount that that
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  might be the case here. Nancy Pelosi is an ego maniac. You have to understand most of the reason
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  why Nancy Pelosi does any of the stuff she does is for herself. She loves being a center of attention.
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:28.000]  She's probably got a whole wall of fame dedicated to herself and her giant San Francisco mansion.
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:36.000]  She just wanted to fly over to Taiwan for the photo opportunity. Do not, do not doubt that that could
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:42.000]  be the case. In fact, that might be the highest likelihood is that Pelosi went over there not
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:48.000]  as a geopolitical stunt, except for she wanted to go over there and be the center of attention and
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  have her picture taken with the Taiwanese delegation. It's all about her. That's how big her ego is.
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  That's how drunk on power this woman is. Did you see her the other day celebrating the assault
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  weapons ban that passed in the house? It's all about her. It's all about her banging that gavel.
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  Her saying, look at what I did. Her getting her picture taken. A new picture for her wall of fame
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  dedicated to herself. A new picture in the front page. Now, you have to realize that's the type of ego
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  maniac that can start a world war with their ego unintentionally by trying to make a statement
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:36.000]  flying over to Taiwan to make the story all about her. But okay, seems like it's kind of a non-event.
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  Seems like it's kind of a non-factor. I see the stories and the Chinese military and the
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  shuffling around and the People's Liberation Army and I see all of it. I think what you're looking at
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  is a drunken power mad ego maniacal freak named Nancy Pelosi who wanted to be the center of the story
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  again and wanted to be in the photos, her photos in the papers, her photos and videos on TV, a new
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:08.000]  photo for her wall of fame in her house because she knows that she's done after this. So I really think
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  it was much ado about nothing to be quite frank. I think this is Nancy Pelosi's fat head, fat arrogant
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:22.000]  head, big ego doing this and I think it'll probably be a come and go situation but that doesn't take away
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  from the seriousness of what's going on in Taiwan with China and the South China Sea and everything
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  else. And then how's this for America's strength? Iran vows to build nukes if provoked and turn New
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  York City into hellish ruins. So North Korea threatens us, Iran threatens us, China threatens us.
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:46.000]  Oh, but Biden got a terrorist guys, he did it. Yeah, that's what happened.

[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:25.000]  Hey Alexa, where did Joe Biden fall off his cycle?
[2:00:25.000 --> 2:00:30.000]  Joe Biden died in National Naval Medical Center.
[2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:36.000]  I could spend the next hour on an 11 minute speech Biden put out from the White House officially.
[2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:41.000]  People thought it was a deep fake and they went and checked it. No, it's on the White House. Completely insane.
[2:00:41.000 --> 2:00:44.000]  In 11 minutes, he blinks six times.
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:49.000]  Let me close with this. Every day we rely on law enforcement to save lives.
[2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  Then on January 6th, we relied on law enforcement to save our democracy.
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:01:02.000]  We saw what happened. The Capitol Police, the DC Metropolitan Police, other law enforcement agencies
[2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:10.000]  were attacked and assaulted before our very eyes. Speared, sprayed, stomped on, brutalized.
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:18.000]  Lives were lost and for three hours the defeated former president of the United States watched it all happen
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  as he sat in the comfort of the private dining room next to the Oval Office.
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:30.000]  While he was doing that, brave law enforcement officers were subject to the medieval hell for three hours.
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  Dripping in blood surrounded by carnage.
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:39.000]  Face to face with crazed mob that believed the lies of the defeated president.
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:45.000]  The police were heroes that day. Donald Trump lacked the courage to act.
[2:01:45.000 --> 2:01:51.000]  The brave women and men in blue all across this nation should never forget that.
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:57.000]  You can't be pro-insurrection and pro-cop. You can't be pro-insurrection and pro-democracy.
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  You can't be pro-insurrection and pro-american.
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:06.000]  I mean, he looks like an animatronic robot at Chuck E. Cheese or something.
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, this looks like the intro to a horror movie or something
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:13.000]  where body snatchers have taken over.
[2:02:13.000 --> 2:02:26.000]  This happens in human civilization and normally collapses civilization for at least a time
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:29.000]  when the good people at Craze is getting charged.
[2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:34.000]  Why is the Biden administration building a border wall in Arizona?
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:39.000]  So, we are not finishing the wall.
[2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:47.000]  We are cleaning up the mess the prior administration left behind in their failed attempt to build a wall.
[2:02:47.000 --> 2:02:52.000]  The more pain we are all experiencing from the high price of gas, the more benefit there is
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:02:54.000]  for those who can access electric vehicles.
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  We let them be in control.
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  Mr. Biden, are you still groping Senator Sildren's creepy Joe Biden?
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:06.000]  They always start assaulting reality and assaulting common sense and assaulting new process and assaulting logic.
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:09.000]  And people keep asking us until everything disintegrates.
[2:03:09.000 --> 2:03:17.000]  This is the first time in American history, I believe, that a chamber of the Congress will pass a bill
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:25.000]  openly defying the Supreme Court's explicit declaration of the constitutional rights of the American people.
[2:03:25.000 --> 2:03:34.000]  It represents the farthest ever reach of the Democrats' long-pursued, massive resistance doctrine.
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:43.000]  In Markup, I asked if any Democrat disputed that this bill bans guns and magazines in common use.
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:47.000]  Chairman Nadler candidly responded, quote,
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:48.000]  Would the gentleman yield?
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  I would if I were to answer that question.
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  Yeah, that's the point of the bill.
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:59.000]  So, you mean to clarify, Mr. Chairman, you're saying it is the point of the bill to ban weapons that are in common use in the United States today.
[2:03:59.000 --> 2:04:01.000]  Yes, the problem is in the common use.
[2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:07.000]  In other words, the essence of the bill is to stop commerce in weapons,
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:11.000]  as alternatively described by the court in Heller in 2008,
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:18.000]  as those, quote, typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes, close quote.
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:20.000]  And that is now the point we've entered at every level.
[2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:23.000]  Donald Trump blocked the Courage Act.
[2:04:23.000 --> 2:04:29.000]  The brave women and men in blue all across this nation should never forget that.
[2:04:29.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  Folks, as we fight inflation, bringing down gas prices is a big part of the job.
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:37.000]  All right, I wanted to play some of the 11-minute speech.
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  As you can see, he's not blinking, and then another speech later where he is.
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:43.000]  I mean, if you can figure out what this is, please tell me.
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:53.000]  We've reached out to some physiologists and people that can perhaps tell us what the world this means, but it's getting crazy.
[2:04:53.000 --> 2:05:01.000]  Info Wars has been vindicated. We've been proven right.
[2:05:01.000 --> 2:05:04.000]  World government, the New World Order is out of the open.
[2:05:04.000 --> 2:05:10.000]  And now more than ever, the forces of Satan are trying to shut down this broadcast.
[2:05:10.000 --> 2:05:14.000]  The forces of anti-human, godless New World Order are out of control.
[2:05:14.000 --> 2:05:18.000]  So now realize, we have pushed them out of the light.
[2:05:18.000 --> 2:05:21.000]  We have pushed them out of the open, and they are so upset, and they are so scared.
[2:05:21.000 --> 2:05:24.000]  So while you still can, because any day can be our last broadcast,
[2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:27.000]  spread the word about the show, share the article, share the videos,
[2:05:27.000 --> 2:05:33.000]  and please fund us while getting great products at the same time at infowarsstore.com.

[2:05:49.000 --> 2:05:52.000]  and pray for free speech, and justice to win.
[2:05:52.000 --> 2:05:55.000]  Thank you so much for joining us, and I'll spread the word, my friends.
[2:05:55.000 --> 2:06:24.000]  We're involved in an epic historic battle.
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:27.000]  And I'm now joined in studio by Bob Barnes.
[2:06:27.000 --> 2:06:31.000]  He's going to be with us the remainder of the Alex Jones show transmission.
[2:06:31.000 --> 2:06:35.000]  And we've got a guest coming on here in 30 minutes with him as well.
[2:06:35.000 --> 2:06:39.000]  Boy, where to go? Let's talk about some legal stuff here.
[2:06:39.000 --> 2:06:43.000]  Bob, because I see this story, and I don't like it at all.
[2:06:43.000 --> 2:06:49.000]  Leadfoot drivers beware, New York City speed cameras now operate 24-7.
[2:06:49.000 --> 2:06:56.000]  I've seen other cities trying to do the same thing where they basically just want to have an AI traffic controller,
[2:06:56.000 --> 2:06:58.000]  basically is what it is.
[2:06:58.000 --> 2:07:01.000]  It's failed in states before. Red light camera laws have failed.
[2:07:01.000 --> 2:07:05.000]  I believe they're illegal in Texas and Missouri, I think, as well now.
[2:07:05.000 --> 2:07:07.000]  Where do you think this one goes?
[2:07:07.000 --> 2:07:09.000]  AI systems, cameras monitoring your speed limits?
[2:07:09.000 --> 2:07:11.000]  Are you running lights? Are you driving too fast?
[2:07:11.000 --> 2:07:14.000]  Do you think this is going to succeed, or will this go away?
[2:07:14.000 --> 2:07:19.000]  Well, I mean, I remember it in Germany, because I personally experienced it. It turns out they really are accurate there in Germany.
[2:07:19.000 --> 2:07:22.000]  I had like nine tickets when I came back.
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:25.000]  That was a lot of money, and that was like 10 years ago.
[2:07:25.000 --> 2:07:29.000]  So they want to replicate that sort of model, the Chinese social credit model system,
[2:07:29.000 --> 2:07:33.000]  and incorporating it through AI and surveillance technology on a permanent basis.
[2:07:33.000 --> 2:07:36.000]  I think ultimately their goal is to put it in your car.
[2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:39.000]  They're saying, oh, they want you to shift to an electric car,
[2:07:39.000 --> 2:07:44.000]  because an electric car is going to be better for the environment. That's still very much in controversy and dispute
[2:07:44.000 --> 2:07:50.000]  how much it actually is, given what goes into making an electric vehicle, and the battery especially.
[2:07:50.000 --> 2:07:54.000]  But the other utility of a lot of those vehicles in new smart cars,
[2:07:54.000 --> 2:07:57.000]  like smartphones, like your smart temperature at home,
[2:07:57.000 --> 2:08:01.000]  is that those things incorporate constant, continuous surveillance.
[2:08:01.000 --> 2:08:03.000]  Like, look at self-automated driving.
[2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:05.000]  Probably never going to happen for a wide range of reasons.
[2:08:05.000 --> 2:08:07.000]  It's hard to replicate the human mind.
[2:08:07.000 --> 2:08:11.000]  However, what it does do is put cameras all around your car and inside your car.
[2:08:11.000 --> 2:08:14.000]  So you could have constant, continuous surveillance.
[2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:16.000]  And my guess is they're going to say down the road,
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:20.000]  even these techniques of using cameras, of using AI, doesn't work,
[2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:25.000]  we need to put it in your car so that whenever your car is exceeding the speed limit
[2:08:25.000 --> 2:08:29.000]  by some digital interaction between the car and something in the local area,
[2:08:29.000 --> 2:08:32.000]  then we can automatically ticket you to protect people's safety.
[2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:34.000]  And what they're really doing, it's what came out in Vault 7.
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:37.000]  I mean, they just put in, they're about to put in prison,
[2:08:37.000 --> 2:08:42.000]  the whistleblower who disclosed all the Vault 7 information from the CIA.
[2:08:42.000 --> 2:08:43.000]  And what did that include?
[2:08:43.000 --> 2:08:46.000]  It included one of the things that Alex Jones had been saying for many, many years,
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:49.000]  that they said, no, that's just Jones making stuff up, you know,
[2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:51.000]  he drank too much that day, whatever.
[2:08:51.000 --> 2:08:53.000]  And what it turned out, of course, the CIA was, in fact,
[2:08:53.000 --> 2:08:57.000]  practicing the habit of using electric vehicles to actually turn off your car
[2:08:57.000 --> 2:08:59.000]  without your knowing, turn off your brakes without your knowing,
[2:08:59.000 --> 2:09:01.000]  cause accidents without your knowing.
[2:09:01.000 --> 2:09:05.000]  How anybody couldn't see that coming? I mean, that's just built right in.
[2:09:05.000 --> 2:09:08.000]  It's so obvious. I mean, like you said, the cameras now is just to set the precedent
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:11.000]  of you're driving your car and all of a sudden you get a ticket out of nowhere.
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:12.000]  You don't even know what happened.
[2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:14.000]  That's just to set the precedent to make it normal.
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:15.000]  Then it'll be built in.
[2:09:15.000 --> 2:09:17.000]  But I wasn't aware of this.
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:23.000]  Vault 7 was maybe the biggest leak in deep state history,
[2:09:23.000 --> 2:09:27.000]  not as far as information but procedures and how they can access your phone,
[2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:30.000]  your car, your TV, the cameras built into all of it.
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:32.000]  I mean, they just have backdoor access to all of it, folks.
[2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:33.000]  They can turn it right on.
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:37.000]  Oh, by the way, I learned this last week.
[2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:42.000]  You can, basically, if your phone is ever on the Internet,
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:43.000]  your phone is always on the Internet.
[2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:46.000]  You can turn the Internet off. You can take your SIM card out.
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:48.000]  You're still connected to the Internet.
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:50.000]  I actually, someone showed me how it's possible.
[2:09:50.000 --> 2:09:55.000]  They took my SIM card out, turned the Internet off, and disabled my phone.
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:57.000]  Like, literally, like, shouldn't work at all.
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:09:59.000]  Still connected to the Internet. Still got emergency alerts.
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:01.000]  So you're always on it.
[2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:06.000]  But so where are the whistleblower protections for the Vault 7 whistleblower
[2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:07.000]  and how come I'm not hearing this?
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:08.000]  This should be bigger news.
[2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:12.000]  Well, I mean, in fact, what happened is they prosecuted them up in the Southern District of New York.
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:13.000]  And it's extraordinary now.
[2:10:13.000 --> 2:10:16.000]  It's always the Southern District of New York or the District of Columbia.
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:20.000]  It's these liberal jurisdictions where all of these cases are being brought.
[2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  I won't mention the case that shall not be mentioned,
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:24.000]  also being brought in a liberal jurisdiction.
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:25.000]  All of them in liberal jurisdictions.
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:28.000]  Here's a guy who, the case should have been high profile.
[2:10:28.000 --> 2:10:29.000]  Okay, he should have been on the front page.
[2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:32.000]  Yeah, I'm upset with myself for not covering this.
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:34.000]  It was completely buried by the institutional press.
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:37.000]  He ended up representing himself, pro se.
[2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:41.000]  Didn't have a available lawyer, apparently, or chose not to have one,
[2:10:41.000 --> 2:10:42.000]  maybe because he didn't trust the system.
[2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:44.000]  But this is the guy who disclosed,
[2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:47.000]  this is a person who should have been rewarded, not punished.
[2:10:47.000 --> 2:10:50.000]  Compare that to the fake whistleblowers against Trump.
[2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:54.000]  Like Reality Winner, who gets TV interviews and made stream stories.
[2:10:54.000 --> 2:10:58.000]  Or the Vindman Brothers, who get promotions and press deals and all the rest.
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:03.000]  Remember, Vindman, he was offered a deal to be like the head of the Ukraine military.
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:06.000]  Absolutely, he was going to be the Defense Secretary for Ukraine.
[2:11:06.000 --> 2:11:09.000]  That deeply involved, he was in the corruption that riddles Ukraine.
[2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:12.000]  And now he are sending billions of dollars to Ukraine.
[2:11:12.000 --> 2:11:14.000]  Exactly, and we don't know where the weapons went and the rest.
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:18.000]  But all of this surveillance, constant continuous surveillance,
[2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:20.000]  is about constant continuous control.
[2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:25.000]  It's all about control, whether it's the attempts to put drugs in your body against your will,
[2:11:25.000 --> 2:11:28.000]  whether it's about lockdowns, whether it's about masks,
[2:11:28.000 --> 2:11:31.000]  whether it's about any of this social credit system,
[2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:35.000]  whether it's about either cameras around your vehicle or in your vehicle
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  or in the local area, all of it's about control, control, control.
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:41.000]  It's the Bill Gates obsession, it's the elite obsession.
[2:11:41.000 --> 2:11:44.000]  That's what's really driving him and that's what all of this is heading towards.
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:47.000]  And it's why it has to be resisted at each and every step.
[2:11:47.000 --> 2:11:51.000]  And when a guy discloses it, because that's what the Vault 7 whistleblower was really disclosing,
[2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:54.000]  the CIA wants to have constant continuous control over you,
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:58.000]  they're experimenting in technology to do that through your car, through your phone,
[2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:03.000]  through your home, very basic things that are directly accessible and intimate to you,
[2:12:03.000 --> 2:12:08.000]  like Snowden talked about, being able to hack in and watch what somebody's doing in their own bed
[2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:12.000]  because they don't realize the computer's always on, the phone's always on, the smart TV,
[2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:18.000]  all these things made for convenience are designed ultimately at maximum levels of control.
[2:12:18.000 --> 2:12:19.000]  And that's what it's all about.
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:22.000]  Yeah, it's the internet. You're going to enter the net.
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:23.000]  Yeah.
[2:12:23.000 --> 2:12:26.000]  And now you've been caught by the Satanic New World Order.
[2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:33.000]  That's crazy to me. The Vault 7, honestly, I mean, what Snowden did was obviously big and brave,
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:37.000]  but the Vault 7 was a much bigger reveal, I would say, than what Snowden revealed.
[2:12:37.000 --> 2:12:43.000]  I mean, Snowden just showed how private contractors had access to it and the potential for the deep state
[2:12:43.000 --> 2:12:47.000]  to do it as well. Vault 7 just pulled the whole curtain back.
[2:12:47.000 --> 2:12:53.000]  Oh, completely. I mean, it actually showed the CIA was actually investigating how they could turn your car lights on or off,
[2:12:53.000 --> 2:12:58.000]  turn your brakes on or off, turn your acceleration on or off, turn your car on or off.
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:02.000]  Like, pretty much anything you could, if you could figure it in your own head like,
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:04.000]  huh, I wonder if they could hack this or hack that.
[2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:06.000]  Yeah, they did it.
[2:13:06.000 --> 2:13:10.000]  Exactly. Against your will and without your knowledge and outside of your consent,
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:12.000]  turn on your little thermometer at home.
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:14.000]  Like, you get one of those little nest thermometers.
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:17.000]  Turn it on to become a spy device anytime they want.
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:22.000]  Not only Alexa, not only all of that, but your thermometer, they could turn on to spy on you.
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:24.000]  Your TV, they could turn on to spy on you.
[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:29.000]  Your computer, they could turn on to spy on you at any given moment without your knowledge and consent.
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:34.000]  All of this was disclosed by this very brave whistleblower who then gets targeted
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:36.000]  and they're probably going to put him away for life.
[2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:37.000]  That's the nature of him.
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:44.000]  He gets a Southern District of New York, a district notorious for its incapacity to have impartial grand juries,
[2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:49.000]  impartial trial juries, non-corrupt prosecutors, apolitical judges.
[2:13:49.000 --> 2:13:52.000]  Those don't exist in the Southern District of New York very often.
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:54.000]  And that's why he was targeted there.
[2:13:54.000 --> 2:13:59.000]  And the press completely suppressed all knowledge of the case, all compared to some other...
[2:13:59.000 --> 2:14:00.000]  Oh, I'm stunned.
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:03.000]  Oh, completely. The press has covered a lot of other cases, including some recently,
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  including the cases that shall not be named, very publicly.
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:08.000]  But the both seven guys, one of the biggest as you know,
[2:14:08.000 --> 2:14:13.000]  one of the biggest whistleblowers in the history of the world exposing dangerous intelligence activity
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:20.000]  is a guy that you almost never heard about, and his criminal prosecution and soon-to-becoming punishment
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:23.000]  is something you'll also likely never hear about from the institutional press.
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:30.000]  They went into...they did like an interview in Reality Winner's Jail Cell telling you how great of a person she was.
[2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:34.000]  Telling, she's not a traitor, she's not a traitor, she's the greatest ever.
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:37.000]  Well, okay, fine. You want to lift her up.
[2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:40.000]  I don't think that she's quite the hero you think, but this...
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:45.000]  Guys, see if you can find any news coverage of the Vault 7 thing. This is wild.
[2:14:45.000 --> 2:14:48.000]  Especially, you look at Reality Winner, she did it for political purposes.
[2:14:48.000 --> 2:14:50.000]  He doesn't do it to get back at one...
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:51.000]  I don't even know his name!
[2:14:51.000 --> 2:14:58.000]  Exactly. He did it solely and wholly so that the whole world would know this is the bad stuff the CIA is up to.
[2:14:58.000 --> 2:15:02.000]  Watch your phone, watch your car, watch your home, watch your TV.
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:05.000]  All of these things that you're buying and purchasing, be very careful.
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:08.000]  Don't pick convenience at the expense of surveillance.
[2:15:08.000 --> 2:15:11.000]  Don't pick convenience at the expense of control.
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:14.000]  That was the message he was trying to get out to people so they could be well-informed.
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:19.000]  It's always been Snowden's Angelina Sange, in particular, his main point.
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:23.000]  It reminds me of the movie Sneakers, No More Secrets.
[2:15:23.000 --> 2:15:27.000]  Secrets are the key to corrupt governments continuing to get to do bad things to people.
[2:15:27.000 --> 2:15:31.000]  And so if you want to stop the government's ability to do bad things to people,
[2:15:31.000 --> 2:15:34.000]  or at least limit it or constrict it, or help people defend themselves,
[2:15:34.000 --> 2:15:36.000]  you need to expose their secrets.
[2:15:36.000 --> 2:15:45.000]  Josh Schulte was the individual's name, CIA whistleblower, sent the Vault 7 documents to WikiLeaks,
[2:15:45.000 --> 2:15:48.000]  and it is a total media blackout.
[2:15:48.000 --> 2:15:52.000]  What happened to the liberal left that used to be against institutional corruption?
[2:15:52.000 --> 2:15:58.000]  They just love it because they control it now.
[2:15:58.000 --> 2:16:00.000]  Sold out for more than six months.
[2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:03.000]  Our number one bestseller is now back in stock.
[2:16:03.000 --> 2:16:09.000]  Vitamin mineral fusion, all the minerals, all the vitamins, all the key amino acids to turbo charge,
[2:16:09.000 --> 2:16:13.000]  your immune system, and make your body as healthy as it could possibly be.
[2:16:13.000 --> 2:16:16.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is our bestselling product because people love it.
[2:16:16.000 --> 2:16:17.000]  We first launched it four years ago.
[2:16:17.000 --> 2:16:18.000]  I was like, okay, that's another item.
[2:16:18.000 --> 2:16:20.000]  It's high quality vitamins, minerals.
[2:16:20.000 --> 2:16:21.000]  Okay, great.
[2:16:21.000 --> 2:16:24.000]  People love it because it tastes great and they see the results.
[2:16:24.000 --> 2:16:25.000]  And it funds the info war.
[2:16:25.000 --> 2:16:27.000]  So sold out for more than six months.
[2:16:27.000 --> 2:16:31.000]  Vitamin mineral fusion is now back in stock for a limited time.
[2:16:31.000 --> 2:16:36.000]  At infowarshot.com for 40% off because I want you to experience it.
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:37.000]  I want you to get it.
[2:16:37.000 --> 2:16:39.000]  I want to move it out the door and hopefully get more in the future.
[2:16:39.000 --> 2:16:42.000]  But who knows, supply chain breakdowns, it may not happen.
[2:16:42.000 --> 2:16:48.000]  So get your vitamin mineral fusion at infowarshot.com today and keep info wars on the air.
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:55.000]  Vitamin mineral fusion back in stock 40% off at infowarshot.com.
[2:16:55.000 --> 2:16:57.000]  Vitamin mineral fusion.
[2:16:57.000 --> 2:17:02.000]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a rancher,
[2:17:02.000 --> 2:17:04.000]  a doctor, a lawyer, or a millionaire.
[2:17:04.000 --> 2:17:07.000]  Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[2:17:07.000 --> 2:17:08.000]  You see it every year.
[2:17:08.000 --> 2:17:10.000]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers.
[2:17:10.000 --> 2:17:13.000]  50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[2:17:13.000 --> 2:17:19.000]  And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups,
[2:17:19.000 --> 2:17:24.000]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this.
[2:17:24.000 --> 2:17:29.000]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody.
[2:17:29.000 --> 2:17:35.000]  To be able to do things tax wise, it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of your money.
[2:17:35.000 --> 2:17:40.000]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[2:17:40.000 --> 2:17:45.000]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL jonestaxrelief.com.
[2:17:45.000 --> 2:17:50.000]  One word, jonestaxrelief.com, or call 833-904-285.
[2:17:50.000 --> 2:18:11.000]  833-904-285.
[2:18:25.000 --> 2:18:28.000]  All we got to do is survive the crash.
[2:18:28.000 --> 2:18:31.000]  And right now, we still have time to prepare.
[2:18:31.000 --> 2:18:35.000]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero.
[2:18:35.000 --> 2:18:44.000]  It's time to convert it into hard assets now, including food, water, and survival gear, to keep us strong and at the ready.
[2:18:44.000 --> 2:18:57.000]  Go to preparedoday.com for the essentials, storable foods, water filtration, first aid, power, and more at preparedoday.com.
[2:18:57.000 --> 2:19:05.000]  The globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family, to destroy heterosexual relationships, to annihilate our marriages.
[2:19:05.000 --> 2:19:07.000]  And the studies are all clear.
[2:19:07.000 --> 2:19:13.000]  The number one cause of marital splits is that there's problems in the bedroom.
[2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:17.000]  And the number one issue men have is erectile dysfunction.
[2:19:17.000 --> 2:19:23.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes about this because they don't want people having lasting, good, loving relationships.
[2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:25.000]  They want to break up society.
[2:19:25.000 --> 2:19:34.000]  And we are so excited to have the number one natural male enhancement pill in the world, available as a major sponsor now.
[2:19:34.000 --> 2:19:44.000]  Go to theironpatriot.com today, theironpatriot.com, and watch the instructional video, look at the science for yourself, and then get a bottle of InstaHeart.
[2:19:44.000 --> 2:19:47.000]  It's discreet shipping. I've used it. It's amazing.
[2:19:47.000 --> 2:19:51.000]  And it's not just for folks that have problems in the bedroom. This also enhances it.
[2:19:51.000 --> 2:20:05.000]  So again, get yours today at theironpatriot.com.
[2:20:25.000 --> 2:20:27.000]  Alright, I want to switch topics here.
[2:20:27.000 --> 2:20:33.000]  I'm going to take an opposite stance on something that I've seen everybody else take.
[2:20:33.000 --> 2:20:35.000]  And I want to hear your take on this too.
[2:20:35.000 --> 2:20:41.000]  And I'm a little late to this, but I've been a little busy this week with the case that shall not be named as you say.
[2:20:41.000 --> 2:20:43.000]  Yes, it's a free country after all.
[2:20:43.000 --> 2:20:49.000]  Saudi Prince offers a glimpse of dazzling $500 billion smart city of the future.
[2:20:49.000 --> 2:20:54.000]  And guys, roll the video if we have it. I know I sent it to you last week.
[2:20:54.000 --> 2:21:00.000]  It's in the Sunday show folder. I don't remember the clip number on here. I've got the list in front of me.
[2:21:00.000 --> 2:21:02.000]  But you guys can find the video.
[2:21:02.000 --> 2:21:07.000]  And so have you seen this? Have you seen this new smart city that's the Saudi Arabian thing?
[2:21:07.000 --> 2:21:08.000]  It's like a big wall.
[2:21:08.000 --> 2:21:13.000]  And now I want to take a different approach to this because I see a lot of people talking trash on it.
[2:21:13.000 --> 2:21:17.000]  Not me. I've got to say, I actually think it's cool.
[2:21:17.000 --> 2:21:19.000]  Now, let me be clear.
[2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:25.000]  I personally would never want to live in that ever for the same reason I would never want to live in New York City.
[2:21:25.000 --> 2:21:28.000]  I don't want to be around that type of a mass of people.
[2:21:28.000 --> 2:21:36.000]  I don't want to be in that sort of a shared civilizational infrastructure, but I don't think it's inherently bad.
[2:21:36.000 --> 2:21:41.000]  I'm actually glad we're seeing engineering innovation and civilization.
[2:21:41.000 --> 2:21:47.000]  And I think Saudi Arabia is a great place to do it. They've had a lot of innovation over there in their architecture and engineering.
[2:21:47.000 --> 2:21:49.000]  So I actually think it's great.
[2:21:49.000 --> 2:21:53.000]  I personally would never want to live there, but I hope the project works.
[2:21:53.000 --> 2:21:55.000]  I'd like to see some innovation in engineering.
[2:21:55.000 --> 2:21:57.000]  Bob, your take.
[2:21:57.000 --> 2:21:59.000]  I have a split feeling.
[2:21:59.000 --> 2:22:04.000]  The idea of experimenting with architecture and cities and the rest, that I think is really cool.
[2:22:04.000 --> 2:22:07.000]  This particular experiment I have great doubts about.
[2:22:07.000 --> 2:22:13.000]  The other thing is that I don't like is, and this has been the Dubai model that really it's just going in a different direction,
[2:22:13.000 --> 2:22:17.000]  but it's MBS taking the Dubai model of we've got excess capital.
[2:22:17.000 --> 2:22:20.000]  So let's create something that the world would love to see.
[2:22:20.000 --> 2:22:23.000]  Rather than why not go back to your history and heritage?
[2:22:23.000 --> 2:22:28.000]  I mean, there's some beautiful architecture designed in the Arab tradition.
[2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:33.000]  Beautiful designs, beautiful ways of building buildings, beautiful ways of using tile.
[2:22:33.000 --> 2:22:40.000]  Why not reincorporate history? It's like large parts of modern architecture throughout the West.
[2:22:40.000 --> 2:22:46.000]  Why not go back, tell me, what's behind this is the beautiful building that's modeled after the capital here in Austin.
[2:22:46.000 --> 2:22:54.000]  It is the Austin capital with not only a beautiful rotunda, but made in a beautiful red granite, I guess it is.
[2:22:54.000 --> 2:22:57.000]  It's just gorgeous to see and witness and go inside.
[2:22:57.000 --> 2:22:59.000]  That goes all the way back to Rome.
[2:22:59.000 --> 2:23:03.000]  So why not look at Rome and Greece and old Europe.
[2:23:03.000 --> 2:23:09.000]  And if you're Saudi Arabia, go back to what made Arab architecture so beautiful in different parts of the world.
[2:23:09.000 --> 2:23:16.000]  Dating back to the 8th century, 9th century, 10th century wasn't all just tense and traveling, traveling folks.
[2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:23.000]  So I would like that more than this kind of Uber environmental centric,
[2:23:23.000 --> 2:23:35.000]  conservative resources, climate change-oriented, futuristic city that doesn't look futuristic enough in ways that I would like to see it done.
[2:23:35.000 --> 2:23:41.000]  I like that they're experimenting with architectural design and creative exploration in the physical space.
[2:23:41.000 --> 2:23:44.000]  This particular design just isn't the way I would go.
[2:23:44.000 --> 2:23:49.000]  See, I think you're taking the debate in a different direction where I would tend to agree with you.
[2:23:49.000 --> 2:23:57.000]  Because I wonder, you go into old buildings in the US, whether it's a capital or old libraries, it's very ornate.
[2:23:57.000 --> 2:24:03.000]  The design is very artistic. Could we even do that anymore?
[2:24:03.000 --> 2:24:10.000]  That's what's so shocking about it to me. I don't even see architecture built like it used to.
[2:24:10.000 --> 2:24:13.000]  I wonder if the architecture engineers are even out there that could.
[2:24:13.000 --> 2:24:19.000]  It's increasingly difficult to do things like you look at some of the ironworks made in places like New Orleans.
[2:24:19.000 --> 2:24:21.000]  People come to the French Quarter for a reason.
[2:24:21.000 --> 2:24:26.000]  It's this beautiful, old, historic place that has buildings designed from several hundred years ago,
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:29.000]  using the design and architecture that was common there.
[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:34.000]  It still draws in millions of people each year, just the architecture and the feel and the connection to history.
[2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:39.000]  That's what people really want. That's what has a long-lasting value.
[2:24:39.000 --> 2:24:45.000]  This does not as much. I think it's because, take the Rose Window, the Rose Window of the Notre Dame.
[2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:49.000]  They don't know if they can recreate that today. It's even capable.
[2:24:49.000 --> 2:24:52.000]  They even have the people that have the talent to do so.
[2:24:52.000 --> 2:24:58.000]  That's what we should be, if Saudi Arabia should be spending money developing the engineers and the architects
[2:24:58.000 --> 2:25:02.000]  that could recreate the glory of its own Arab architectural past.
[2:25:02.000 --> 2:25:09.000]  It's best gems from beautiful cities and beautiful buildings and beautiful roads and beautiful designs that incorporated
[2:25:09.000 --> 2:25:15.000]  the indigenous natural environment into its architecture, the way Frank Lloyd Wright did here in the United States.
[2:25:15.000 --> 2:25:20.000]  That, I think, would be much more beautiful and much more robust and much more welcome
[2:25:20.000 --> 2:25:25.000]  than weird futuristic cities that look like Blade Runner designed by Greta Thumber.
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:27.000]  I don't think it's that bad.
[2:25:27.000 --> 2:25:33.000]  I think it's getting a bad rap just because we know about globalism and we know about the centralization
[2:25:33.000 --> 2:25:36.000]  of civilization that the globalists want.
[2:25:36.000 --> 2:25:40.000]  I have hope for it. Again, I would never want to live there.
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:45.000]  I look at a situation like Austin, which has just expanded so much.
[2:25:45.000 --> 2:25:49.000]  Just in the eight years I've been here, it's just incredible how much it's expanded.
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:52.000]  I can't even imagine somebody that's lived here 20 and going through all of it.
[2:25:52.000 --> 2:25:57.000]  But Austin was kind of, you know, it was kind of effed in a way, right?
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:26:03.000]  There was no way for us to potentially rebuild an infrastructure in such a short period of time
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:07.000]  to facilitate the masses of people coming here.
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:12.000]  So it's just skyscrapers going up, apartment buildings, condos going up, all this centralized stuff,
[2:26:12.000 --> 2:26:17.000]  small infrastructure. They try to build train tracks for people to travel.
[2:26:17.000 --> 2:26:21.000]  It doesn't really work. Nobody uses it. The buses, nobody really uses them.
[2:26:21.000 --> 2:26:23.000]  It's a very commuter-centric city.
[2:26:23.000 --> 2:26:30.000]  But what I wish we would start doing better is building infrastructure to facilitate people
[2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:32.000]  before the people get there.
[2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:35.000]  You know, that's one of the big problems, I think, that the metro areas have had in the U.S.
[2:26:35.000 --> 2:26:39.000]  and why they've collapsed. And I think that's why, when you're talking about Saudi Arabia
[2:26:39.000 --> 2:26:45.000]  or the UAE or these other areas, they're building the infrastructure before the mass of people show up.
[2:26:45.000 --> 2:26:47.000]  And there are ways to reincorporate this.
[2:26:47.000 --> 2:26:51.000]  There are people that are old-school urban redevelopment folks that love the old history,
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:55.000]  incorporate small parks and local neighborhoods, more of that, create a community sense.
[2:26:55.000 --> 2:27:00.000]  A lot of this was broken up in the 1950s because the sort of new powers that be came in
[2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:03.000]  and did not want urban political machines to have power.
[2:27:03.000 --> 2:27:06.000]  They didn't want the old black professional middle class to have power.
[2:27:06.000 --> 2:27:10.000]  It wasn't the riots that took down the Black Wall Street.
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:14.000]  It was the interstate highway system in the 1950s that took out Black Wall Street
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:18.000]  in pretty much every town in America, even in St. Louis.
[2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:21.000]  They went into places where you had a strong black professional middle class
[2:27:21.000 --> 2:27:24.000]  and they drove an interstate literally right through it.
[2:27:24.000 --> 2:27:26.000]  That was the bottle district in St. Louis.
[2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:30.000]  Some of those old warehouses and factories are still there. They're just ruins.
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:32.000]  Completely. And it was like the interstate system was a disaster.
[2:27:32.000 --> 2:27:34.000]  It was a debacle from day one.
[2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:37.000]  I mean, the Who Framed Roger Rabbit story is actually partially true.
[2:27:37.000 --> 2:27:43.000]  I mean, LA had the, after World War II, even into the 1940s, before World War II,
[2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:46.000]  LA had the best public transit system in the world.
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:48.000]  Now it has the worst public transit system in the world.
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:53.000]  And the reason was the auto companies came in and bought out the public transit system,
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:57.000]  dismantled the red car, and replaced it with buses
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:28:01.000]  because they knew if LA became a car city, America would become a car country.
[2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:05.000]  And so their goal was to eliminate public transit systems
[2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:07.000]  and to replace it with the private automobile
[2:28:07.000 --> 2:28:09.000]  because it would enrich them at the end of the day.
[2:28:09.000 --> 2:28:13.000]  And even though it did so at the expense of a lot of ordinary working class families
[2:28:13.000 --> 2:28:15.000]  who couldn't afford certain things and so on and so forth.
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:19.000]  So the, and in devastating damage to the black professional middle class,
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:23.000]  and that ended up severing the black working class from the black professional class,
[2:28:23.000 --> 2:28:26.000]  which integration actually helped accomplish too,
[2:28:26.000 --> 2:28:30.000]  which left an abandoned black working class, abandoned by the industrial jobs that have left.
[2:28:30.000 --> 2:28:33.000]  Yeah, not to mention the factories and everything going overseas too.
[2:28:33.000 --> 2:28:34.000]  Yes.
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:39.000]  So will you ever be spotted in the great mirror wall of Saudi Arabia?
[2:28:39.000 --> 2:28:41.000]  I would be tempted to see that just to see it.
[2:28:41.000 --> 2:28:43.000]  But I've been offered the trips to Dubai.
[2:28:43.000 --> 2:28:44.000]  I've skipped for now.
[2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:46.000]  Time will tell, but I'd be tempted.
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:49.000]  I just think it's getting a bad rap.
[2:28:49.000 --> 2:28:52.000]  I say it's innovation and engineering.
[2:28:52.000 --> 2:28:53.000]  It doesn't have to be a bad thing.
[2:28:53.000 --> 2:28:54.000]  Maybe it'll be good.
[2:28:54.000 --> 2:29:04.000]  All right, we'll be right back.
[2:29:44.000 --> 2:29:49.000]  Whatever you do, pray for justice and pray for freedom and pray for the children
[2:29:49.000 --> 2:29:52.000]  and pray for free speech and justice to win.

[2:33:31.000 --> 2:33:36.000]  This is a guest that Bob got on but he was explaining Ryan's YouTube channels in the break
[2:33:36.000 --> 2:33:39.000]  and I was so excited I just had to stick around.
[2:33:39.000 --> 2:33:45.000]  Plus anybody who's got a channel called Sports Wars, oh that sounds like a spin off of InfoWars,
[2:33:45.000 --> 2:33:48.000]  I had to talk to him as well.
[2:33:48.000 --> 2:33:50.000]  I don't know if he had intended it that way.
[2:33:50.000 --> 2:33:52.000]  I'm just saying that what was going on in my head.
[2:33:52.000 --> 2:33:55.000]  So Bob Barnes, Ryan Kittle with us here on the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:55.000 --> 2:33:58.000]  Folks real quick before we get Ryan on, remember InfoWareStore.com.

[2:34:08.000 --> 2:34:11.000]  I know a lot of people are making bulk purchases because we don't want to run out.

[2:34:21.000 --> 2:34:24.000]  Alright Bob, why don't you start the conversation off.
[2:34:24.000 --> 2:34:27.000]  What's the big topics you and Ryan are going to get into here?
[2:34:27.000 --> 2:34:30.000]  So yeah, we're going to be talking about news out of Cleveland today
[2:34:30.000 --> 2:34:35.000]  with Deshaun Watson possibly only facing a six game suspension which is good news
[2:34:35.000 --> 2:34:40.000]  for the Browns fans and the Cleveland Browns organization and Deshaun Watson.
[2:34:40.000 --> 2:34:44.000]  But whether the Wilksters will be happy and satisfied with that punishment
[2:34:44.000 --> 2:34:48.000]  even though it follows a whole season he was effectively suspended last year.
[2:34:48.000 --> 2:34:50.000]  And this is the whole nature of the Wilk NFL.
[2:34:50.000 --> 2:34:51.000]  We're here with Ryan Kittle.
[2:34:51.000 --> 2:34:55.000]  You can find him on Sports Wars at YouTube and a range of other places
[2:34:55.000 --> 2:34:58.000]  in the Geeks and Gamers universe.
[2:34:58.000 --> 2:35:02.000]  So Ryan, what are your thoughts on the Deshaun Watson suspension
[2:35:02.000 --> 2:35:07.000]  and will the Wilksters be satisfied with only six games?
[2:35:07.000 --> 2:35:10.000]  It's tough Robert because when you look at how he was affected last season
[2:35:10.000 --> 2:35:12.000]  that definitely has to play a role.
[2:35:12.000 --> 2:35:15.000]  But at the same time when you're talking about a six game suspension
[2:35:15.000 --> 2:35:20.000]  for someone who is alleged to have done something with over two dozen different masseuses
[2:35:20.000 --> 2:35:24.000]  you know those massage therapists you always find on Instagram
[2:35:24.000 --> 2:35:28.000]  the best way for professional athletes to get good body massages.
[2:35:28.000 --> 2:35:30.000]  You know it's going to be tough to justify six games.
[2:35:30.000 --> 2:35:34.000]  When Tom Brady gets four games for essentially nothing
[2:35:34.000 --> 2:35:38.000]  when you have guys getting suspended a year for testing positive for marijuana
[2:35:38.000 --> 2:35:39.000]  I don't know.
[2:35:39.000 --> 2:35:40.000]  I do know one thing Robert.
[2:35:40.000 --> 2:35:42.000]  I know if Deshaun Watson was someone else
[2:35:42.000 --> 2:35:46.000]  we would have heard a lot more about this stuff from ESPN.
[2:35:46.000 --> 2:35:49.000]  But because Deshaun Watson is one of the guys who kneels for the National Anthem
[2:35:49.000 --> 2:35:51.000]  because Deshaun Watson is one of the guys out there
[2:35:51.000 --> 2:35:55.000]  who fits the narrative for ESPN and all the Wilk sports media
[2:35:55.000 --> 2:36:00.000]  it seems like this story hasn't gotten nearly as much traction as it would have otherwise.
[2:36:00.000 --> 2:36:01.000]  I was unaware of that.
[2:36:01.000 --> 2:36:06.000]  Is Deshaun Watson very political in his presentation?
[2:36:06.000 --> 2:36:09.000]  You know for the first couple years of his career probably not
[2:36:09.000 --> 2:36:12.000]  but he did make a big show you know when the NFL decided
[2:36:12.000 --> 2:36:15.000]  that they were going to double and triple down on Wilk identity politics
[2:36:15.000 --> 2:36:17.000]  he did kneel for the National Anthem.
[2:36:17.000 --> 2:36:19.000]  He was one of those guys and you know at this point
[2:36:19.000 --> 2:36:22.000]  it's tough to find some guys who are actually willing to stand
[2:36:22.000 --> 2:36:25.000]  in these different sports especially through that pandemic era
[2:36:25.000 --> 2:36:28.000]  with the George Floyd protests and everything that happened.
[2:36:28.000 --> 2:36:32.000]  So Deshaun Watson absolutely was one of those guys who was out there virtue signaling
[2:36:32.000 --> 2:36:35.000]  and then it turns out those who virtue signal the hardest
[2:36:35.000 --> 2:36:38.000]  often might be doing a couple things behind the scenes.
[2:36:38.000 --> 2:36:40.000]  Yeah I mean and what do you think about it?
[2:36:40.000 --> 2:36:43.000]  I see it as the racism side and the sexism side
[2:36:43.000 --> 2:36:47.000]  so the NFL doesn't know which way to weigh in on it in terms of its Wilksterism.
[2:36:47.000 --> 2:36:50.000]  The other aspect though is another part of the story is not being told
[2:36:50.000 --> 2:36:54.000]  is any degree of skepticism about some of the women's claims.
[2:36:54.000 --> 2:36:57.000]  So grand jury in Texas looked at this didn't bring any indictment.
[2:36:57.000 --> 2:37:03.000]  If you're a model on Instagram and an NFL player reaches out to you for a massage
[2:37:03.000 --> 2:37:07.000]  are you really surprised that it's something more than a massage?
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:11.000]  Oh I've said this from the beginning I got a little bit of backlash
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:15.000]  because effectively I said these women kind of understood what the game was
[2:37:15.000 --> 2:37:17.000]  they knew what they were getting into.
[2:37:17.000 --> 2:37:19.000]  Does that make it right what went down? Absolutely not
[2:37:19.000 --> 2:37:23.000]  but I think personally that's the reason why this grand jury came back
[2:37:23.000 --> 2:37:25.000]  and didn't indict Deshaun on anything
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:28.000]  because all of the women would have had to self incriminate
[2:37:28.000 --> 2:37:32.000]  all of the women were probably you know not being totally truth about what went down
[2:37:32.000 --> 2:37:36.000]  and yet at the end of the day these women were out there to get paid off.
[2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:38.000]  Does that change your perspective on it?
[2:37:38.000 --> 2:37:40.000]  It might depends from where you're coming from
[2:37:40.000 --> 2:37:43.000]  but there's no doubt that over a two dozen women
[2:37:43.000 --> 2:37:45.000]  you know coming with similar stories
[2:37:45.000 --> 2:37:48.000]  that's pretty shocking here especially that New York Times article they did
[2:37:48.000 --> 2:37:53.000]  it's a tough line especially when Roger Goodell has tried to make it a point
[2:37:53.000 --> 2:37:58.000]  at the beginning of his tenure to go hard on these guys to keep a very good image for the NFL
[2:37:58.000 --> 2:38:01.000]  it suddenly changed now that they're far more concerned with other things
[2:38:01.000 --> 2:38:03.000]  rather than just what's on the field.
[2:38:03.000 --> 2:38:06.000]  Yeah and you know what's interesting about this to me
[2:38:06.000 --> 2:38:11.000]  this case gets so much attention where I mean it's pretty obvious
[2:38:11.000 --> 2:38:15.000]  I think Deshaun Watson is you know probably a womanizer
[2:38:15.000 --> 2:38:18.000]  I guess you could maybe say that but did he commit any crimes?
[2:38:18.000 --> 2:38:20.000]  It doesn't appear that way there were no charges
[2:38:20.000 --> 2:38:22.000]  he's already missed an entire season
[2:38:22.000 --> 2:38:25.000]  it feels like the NFL is trying to have their cake and eat it too
[2:38:25.000 --> 2:38:28.000]  where it's like well Deshaun Watson has a bad image
[2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:31.000]  so we're going to suspend him for six games
[2:38:31.000 --> 2:38:34.000]  well he might be a bad guy he might not treat women right
[2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:36.000]  but does he deserve any suspension?
[2:38:36.000 --> 2:38:40.000]  I mean is this suspension not just a PR move by the NFL?
[2:38:40.000 --> 2:38:44.000]  I think it is to some extent but at the same time
[2:38:44.000 --> 2:38:47.000]  what we've seen before with these suspensions
[2:38:47.000 --> 2:38:50.000]  to me it does fall in line with what they've done
[2:38:50.000 --> 2:38:52.000]  and when you look at Ezekiel Elliott
[2:38:52.000 --> 2:38:55.000]  you know essentially let's you have pulled down a women's top
[2:38:55.000 --> 2:38:57.000]  get six game suspension.
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:39:00.000]  What Deshaun Watson is going through is a lot more than that
[2:39:00.000 --> 2:39:04.000]  I do think crimes were committed but I think it was consensual by both parties
[2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:06.000]  so that probably does affect how people are looking at it
[2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:09.000]  I think you're going to have people mad on both sides of this thing
[2:39:09.000 --> 2:39:11.000]  you're going to have some people say look at all this stuff
[2:39:11.000 --> 2:39:15.000]  he got off scot free essentially with a six game suspension
[2:39:15.000 --> 2:39:18.000]  you're going to have other people that don't think he should have been suspended at all
[2:39:18.000 --> 2:39:21.000]  NFL is in a tough place but they've put themselves here
[2:39:21.000 --> 2:39:24.000]  with so much of the virtue signaling that they have done
[2:39:24.000 --> 2:39:27.000]  whether it be for stand up to sexism
[2:39:27.000 --> 2:39:30.000]  we want to stand up against domestic abuses all those things
[2:39:30.000 --> 2:39:34.000]  well now that the tide's shifted a little bit their focus is somewhere else
[2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:36.000]  maybe they don't want to go as hard on that now
[2:39:36.000 --> 2:39:38.000]  it's a tough spot but that's what you do to yourself
[2:39:38.000 --> 2:39:40.000]  when you virtue signal
[2:39:40.000 --> 2:39:43.000]  and to what degree do you believe that how much has all of the virtue signaling
[2:39:43.000 --> 2:39:47.000]  that Roger Goodell has done for the NFL been net positive for the NFL
[2:39:47.000 --> 2:39:50.000]  because they took a massive hit in ratings they've got some of that back
[2:39:50.000 --> 2:39:53.000]  by being less overtly political
[2:39:53.000 --> 2:39:58.000]  how much has being woke hurt the NFL and virtue signaling and being politically involved
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:01.000]  and secondly what do you think will happen this year in terms of
[2:40:01.000 --> 2:40:04.000]  will they continue to escalate the virtue signaling
[2:40:04.000 --> 2:40:08.000]  or will they start to dial it back given how much damage it did to them in the ratings
[2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:12.000]  well everybody knows the NFL is king
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:15.000]  and when you are king you know you can fall a little bit
[2:40:15.000 --> 2:40:19.000]  maybe not even feel it maybe you can afford the virtue signal a little bit
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:22.000]  maybe if you lose that 15 to 20% of your audience in those ratings
[2:40:22.000 --> 2:40:24.000]  you know maybe you can satisfy yourself
[2:40:24.000 --> 2:40:29.000]  I think the NFL realized that we're leaving billions on the table by doing this two years ago
[2:40:29.000 --> 2:40:32.000]  last year I think they course corrected a little bit
[2:40:32.000 --> 2:40:34.000]  they're still giving the players what they want
[2:40:34.000 --> 2:40:36.000]  they're like hey you can do your virtue signal
[2:40:36.000 --> 2:40:39.000]  we give you a whole month you can do whatever you want we'll support you
[2:40:39.000 --> 2:40:41.000]  so they're still paying lip service to it
[2:40:41.000 --> 2:40:43.000]  but I think for the most part
[2:40:43.000 --> 2:40:47.000]  all majority of fans want is for the broadcast experience
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:49.000]  and what you go and see at the game
[2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:51.000]  that's the part that they want to remain unaffected
[2:40:51.000 --> 2:40:55.000]  and the NFL is playing a little balancing act by trying to have their cake and eat it too
[2:40:55.000 --> 2:40:58.000]  there's no doubt that when they virtue signal this hard
[2:40:58.000 --> 2:41:02.000]  when they make sports about things that aren't sports related
[2:41:02.000 --> 2:41:06.000]  you are going to have you're going to have some bad things happen to you
[2:41:06.000 --> 2:41:08.000]  the NFL saw that and tried to course corrected
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:11.000]  I don't think it's near as bad as what we saw in the NBA
[2:41:11.000 --> 2:41:15.000]  or even Major League Baseball moving the all-star game and all that garbage
[2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:18.000]  but there's no doubt that people are very wary of everything in entertainment
[2:41:18.000 --> 2:41:21.000]  including sports when you start to inject this
[2:41:21.000 --> 2:41:24.000]  well and I think you know Bob and I agreed
[2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:27.000]  I think most football fans would agree that
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:29.000]  hey you know what?
[2:41:29.000 --> 2:41:32.000]  leave whatever's going off the field to the courts
[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:34.000]  to the justice system
[2:41:34.000 --> 2:41:36.000]  and if there's charge in a crime then we'll act
[2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:39.000]  but as long as there's not it's innocent until proven guilty
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:42.000]  and the NFL is trying to maintain this balancing act of image
[2:41:42.000 --> 2:41:44.000]  and virtue signaling but also like
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:47.000]  hey there's no crime here and they're really just flailing and flopping
[2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:50.000]  but you know here's something I'm pretty confident in right now
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:52.000]  and I wonder what you guys are thinking too
[2:41:52.000 --> 2:41:55.000]  I think a good bet is against the Browns this year
[2:41:55.000 --> 2:41:58.000]  I don't think betting on the Browns is a smart move this year
[2:41:58.000 --> 2:42:01.000]  I don't see Deshaun Watson who's an incredible talent obviously
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:03.000]  I don't know how he recovers
[2:42:03.000 --> 2:42:05.000]  I don't know how the Browns recover this year
[2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:08.000]  you know I have a mixed feeling so what do you think Ryan?
[2:42:08.000 --> 2:42:13.000]  I think that to bring a player in with this much stuff going on behind the scenes
[2:42:13.000 --> 2:42:16.000]  to give him $250 million effectively guaranteed
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:19.000]  that is the most Browns thing that they could possibly do
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:21.000]  I think Deshaun Watson is a great talent
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:23.000]  I have questions if he'll be able to stay healthy
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:25.000]  and what his leadership ability
[2:42:25.000 --> 2:42:28.000]  how it might be affected with all the stuff going on
[2:42:28.000 --> 2:42:31.000]  I'm liking the under on the Browns win total this season
[2:42:31.000 --> 2:42:33.000]  I'm liking the under
[2:42:33.000 --> 2:42:35.000]  I don't even know what the number is yet
[2:42:35.000 --> 2:42:36.000]  I know I like it
[2:42:36.000 --> 2:42:39.000]  When we come back with Ryan we're going to be discussing
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:41.000]  the future of Disney
[2:42:41.000 --> 2:42:44.000]  how much have they completely destroyed Star Wars
[2:42:44.000 --> 2:42:47.000]  destroyed Marvel and destroyed themselves
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:42:54.000]  when we come back after the break
[2:43:23.000 --> 2:43:25.000]  spread the word about the show
[2:43:25.000 --> 2:43:27.000]  share the articles share the videos
[2:43:27.000 --> 2:43:29.000]  and please fund us
[2:43:29.000 --> 2:43:31.000]  we'll get great products at the same time

[2:43:49.000 --> 2:43:51.000]  and justice to win
[2:43:51.000 --> 2:43:53.000]  thank you so much for joining us
[2:43:53.000 --> 2:43:55.000]  I'll spread the word my friends
[2:43:55.000 --> 2:43:57.000]  we're involved in an epic historic battle
[2:43:57.000 --> 2:43:59.000]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria
[2:43:59.000 --> 2:44:01.000]  or pump gas or whether you're a farmer
[2:44:01.000 --> 2:44:03.000]  a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire
[2:44:03.000 --> 2:44:05.000]  Fortune and Money magazine
[2:44:05.000 --> 2:44:07.000]  have all done these profiles
[2:44:07.000 --> 2:44:09.000]  you see it every year
[2:44:09.000 --> 2:44:11.000]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers
[2:44:11.000 --> 2:44:13.000]  50 different tax returns, 50 different answers
[2:44:13.000 --> 2:44:15.000]  most all of them just
[2:44:15.000 --> 2:44:17.000]  screw you over especially the big firms
[2:44:17.000 --> 2:44:19.000]  and the big tax groups because they're part
[2:44:19.000 --> 2:44:21.000]  of the system and they don't want the general public
[2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:23.000]  understanding this and knowing this
[2:44:23.000 --> 2:44:25.000]  so it's a very important situation
[2:44:25.000 --> 2:44:27.000]  with inflation and all the things out there
[2:44:27.000 --> 2:44:29.000]  hurting everybody
[2:44:29.000 --> 2:44:31.000]  to be able to do things
[2:44:31.000 --> 2:44:33.000]  tax wise it's legal and lawful
[2:44:33.000 --> 2:44:35.000]  that allows you to keep more of your money
[2:44:35.000 --> 2:44:37.000]  we wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten
[2:44:37.000 --> 2:44:39.000]  great tax advice in the last few years
[2:44:39.000 --> 2:44:41.000]  the only way you fail
[2:44:41.000 --> 2:44:43.000]  is not writing down the URL
