[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.439]  It's Saturday, October 1st, 2021.
[00:00:14.698 --> 00:00:16.780]  This is an emergency transmission.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.084]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:24.467 --> 00:00:25.308]  Get ready!
[00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:35.073]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:00:35.293 --> 00:00:37.413]  You better believe you got one!
[00:00:39.594 --> 00:00:44.795]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:44.754 --> 00:00:54.754]  [Music]
[00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:59.754]  Saturday, October 1st, 2022.
[00:00:59.754 --> 00:01:04.754]  [Music]
[00:01:04.754 --> 00:01:10.754]   All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is 1.30 Central Time as I cut this.
[00:01:10.532 --> 00:01:18.578]  We just taped a three-hour, commercial-free so far, blockbuster transmission.
[00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:22.580]  Best interview I've ever done with David Icke.
[00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:27.569]   Out of the park, two hours long, No breaks.
[00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.810]  That's coming up.
[00:01:30.731 --> 00:01:32.631]  Just finished taping five minutes ago.
[00:01:34.012 --> 00:01:42.696]  But before that, at 930 in the morning, I did an hour plus interview with the inventor of podcasting and one of the smartest people out there, Adam Curry.
[00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:44.687]  And that's about to air.
[00:01:45.387 --> 00:01:46.988]  We're going to post this Demand.Video.
[00:01:47.008 --> 00:01:49.029]  We're going to stream it over InfoWars.com.
[00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.791]  And any TV or radio affiliates want to pick it up, great.
[00:01:52.451 --> 00:01:55.013]  I'm going to the show trial next Tuesday and Wednesday.
[00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:56.994]  Then it's going to be over in Connecticut.
[00:01:57.034 --> 00:02:02.457]  So on those days, we're going to air these interviews there as well because they are just out of the park.
[00:02:02.577 --> 00:02:05.459]  The clarity, the information, it all integrates together.
[00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:13.084]  You want the blueprint of the enemy and how to stop them, how to be victorious, how to be empowered, how to break the matrix, how to take your consciousness to the next level.
[00:02:14.465 --> 00:02:17.667]  You're about to get three plus hours.
[00:02:18.188 --> 00:02:19.068]  Ike was over two hours.
[00:02:19.128 --> 00:02:19.949]  Curry was an hour.
[00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:24.612]  You're about to get three hours of power.
[00:02:26.232 --> 00:02:27.893]  And I just love the format.
[00:02:28.453 --> 00:02:31.134]  They tried to de-platform us, but we were on hundreds of radio stations.
[00:02:31.594 --> 00:02:34.555]  Assuming they took us off the internet in most places, we were still able to stay on air.
[00:02:34.855 --> 00:02:36.896]  The affiliates are great, TV stations, you name it.
[00:02:37.236 --> 00:02:39.737]  Hell, when we got de-platformed four years ago, we had 200 affiliates.
[00:02:40.018 --> 00:02:42.098]  We're over 400 right now, and it's beautiful.
[00:02:42.138 --> 00:02:43.759]  But you got 14 minutes of ads an hour.
[00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.960]  It's annoying, I know, but that's for the local stations.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.241]  And we just fill in our stuff over the network.
[00:02:49.061 --> 00:02:54.984]  But more and more, and I promise you this, and I've said this for a long time, I'm going to be doing podcasts more and more.
[00:02:55.004 --> 00:02:55.744]  I'll still do the show.
[00:02:56.584 --> 00:03:00.086]  But two, three, four days a week, you're going to get an hour, a two-hour, a three-hour podcast.
[00:03:00.927 --> 00:03:08.852]  And everybody that's founding members of the coins at 1776coin.com, you're going to get a free passcode.
[00:03:09.092 --> 00:03:10.053]  Because most of it will be free.
[00:03:10.073 --> 00:03:13.635]  I'll go like two hours and then do an hour, you know, that's subscription.
[00:03:13.716 --> 00:03:14.896]  You're going to get a free membership.
[00:03:15.217 --> 00:03:17.678]  That's just some of the stuff that's happening for folks that did that.
[00:03:17.738 --> 00:03:18.639]  So let me do this.
[00:03:19.847 --> 00:03:25.091]  I just taped three hours, three plus hours, and I got a bunch of the news I want to hit, but I'm just going to get right to these interviews.
[00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:30.115]  Tomorrow on the Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m., I'll hit all this other news that's breaking and information.
[00:03:30.155 --> 00:03:35.440]  But at the same time, we got to pay the bills, and we got great products you already need.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.785]  So if you want to continue to see groundbreaking information like you're about to see and hear, InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:03:42.563 --> 00:03:47.567]  Go to mfulworthstore.com and get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World for 20-something bucks.
[00:03:48.248 --> 00:03:48.748]  It's awesome.
[00:03:48.768 --> 00:03:49.589]  It's a great book.
[00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:50.430]  Great to have.
[00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.230]  Great to give as a gift.
[00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:55.474]  Or get the signed copy that has a big markup as a fundraiser.
[00:03:55.494 --> 00:03:58.657]  Again, PBS NPR will sell a coffee cup that costs $5 for $50.
[00:03:58.977 --> 00:04:01.219]  Or a t-shirt that costs $10 for $100.
[00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:03.761]  Knowing you donated, that's why you did it.
[00:04:03.781 --> 00:04:04.441]  You get a memento.
[00:04:05.582 --> 00:04:10.947]  Well, here you get a silver dollar made in America with my artwork, Teddy Roosevelt, Man of the Arena.
[00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:16.950]  With a markup on it to know you funded the operation and have that memento to know you did it.
[00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.291]  1776coin.com.
[00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:23.413]  So 17761776coin.com is where you go to get the Teddy Roosevelt coin.
[00:04:23.433 --> 00:04:24.513]  We sold out about half of them.
[00:04:24.934 --> 00:04:26.294]  The next few weeks they'll probably be gone.
[00:04:26.314 --> 00:04:28.815]  I want to thank all you that have gotten the coin.
[00:04:29.236 --> 00:04:34.178]  And even though the first three were founding member coins, we're gonna, this is the last coin this year, probably for a long time.
[00:04:34.858 --> 00:04:38.580]  I'm going to give founding member status to everybody that also gets this coin as well.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.902]  So look for your email for discounts and specials and free memberships and so much more.
[00:04:44.342 --> 00:04:49.164]  Already folks that were founding members got 30% off on the Teddy Roosevelt coin.
[00:04:49.524 --> 00:04:51.845]  That's an example of what happens, but that's not why you're doing it.
[00:04:52.185 --> 00:04:54.946]  You want to keep InfoWars on the air during this critical fight.
[00:04:55.146 --> 00:04:56.327]  Money is key right now.

[00:05:57.469 --> 00:06:07.556]  I've been shipping stuff for 25 years, but during the bankruptcy and there was some stuff that happened and things went on and the bankruptcy CRO didn't budget the money to ship the product.
[00:06:07.876 --> 00:06:09.937]  So we got behind a few weeks, but now we're caught up.
[00:06:10.438 --> 00:06:12.899]  You get your order in on a Monday, it's usually shipped on a Tuesday.
[00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.181]  Most people get their order within four days.
[00:06:15.701 --> 00:06:18.923]  So for all of you that had problems with your orders, you've all gotten them.
[00:06:18.943 --> 00:06:19.424]  You're happy.
[00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:19.924]  It's great.

[00:06:21.775 --> 00:06:23.896]  Just being honest with you, that we had that hiccup.

[00:06:58.035 --> 00:07:00.537]  This was an amazing interview with Adam Curry.

[00:07:05.275 --> 00:07:06.595]  Two hours commercial free.
[00:07:07.075 --> 00:07:08.756]  David Icke coming up.

[00:08:00.623 --> 00:08:02.064]  We weren't supposed to exist anymore.
[00:08:02.384 --> 00:08:06.346]  We were already supposed to be shut down, but thanks to you, your perseverance, we're still on air.
[00:08:06.747 --> 00:08:08.107]  So make the decision now.
[00:08:08.407 --> 00:08:09.308]  Free Will Universe.

[00:08:23.808 --> 00:08:27.648]  This is must-see, must-share information.
[00:08:27.648 --> 00:08:33.206]   So we're gonna go to break and come back with the great Adam Curry, David Icke, and more.
[00:08:33.206 --> 00:08:38.727]  (upbeat music)
[00:08:38.727 --> 00:08:41.307]  (upbeat music)
[00:08:41.307 --> 00:08:52.288]  InfoWars.
[00:08:52.476 --> 00:08:53.356]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:08:53.677 --> 00:08:53.997]  Today.
[00:08:57.942 --> 00:09:05.164]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this emergency Saturday broadcast.
[00:09:05.184 --> 00:09:11.326]  When I say emergency, you see we are in a growing, intensifying emergency.
[00:09:12.806 --> 00:09:20.460]   Geopolitically, war Proxy wars, destabilized borders, collapsing currencies.
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.001]  The list goes on and on.
[00:09:22.021 --> 00:09:32.806]  And you have Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum admitting, out of these global crises, they are bringing in their Great Reset and their New World Order Agenda 2030.
[00:09:32.846 --> 00:09:35.947]  So we're going to be looking at Russia.
[00:09:36.147 --> 00:09:40.409]  I told you two weeks ago, look for a massive, massive escalation.
[00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:44.551]  Now the pipelines have both been, one blown up, one damaged.
[00:09:44.831 --> 00:09:45.452]  Nord Stream 1 and 2.
[00:09:46.718 --> 00:09:49.240]  Now they're talking about other pipelines are probably going to get destroyed.
[00:09:49.781 --> 00:09:54.284]  You've got other European pipelines turning on the same day that Nord Stream was blown up.
[00:09:55.145 --> 00:09:59.028]  You have Russia threatening nuclear war, Putin saying he's not bluffing.
[00:09:59.128 --> 00:10:11.338]  And in the background of this, we have the private Federal Reserve, we have the head of the European Union, all the big banking heads saying that they're soon going to roll out these digital programmable currencies.
[00:10:12.299 --> 00:10:22.074]   I was driving down the highway the other morning, And I was flipping through the AM dial and came across 1200AI, and I heard a voice I recognized.
[00:10:23.194 --> 00:10:29.198]  And then I drove under an overpass, right as they were going to break, and I didn't hear who he was talking to, but I said, I know this guy.
[00:10:29.498 --> 00:10:30.438]  This guy is so smart.
[00:10:30.478 --> 00:10:31.199]  I got to get him on.
[00:10:31.259 --> 00:10:31.639]  Who is it?
[00:10:32.099 --> 00:10:33.540]  They come back, do another segment.
[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:34.700]  It's Adam Curry.
[00:10:35.221 --> 00:10:37.382]  And I'm like, oh my gosh, I got to beg Adam to come on.
[00:10:37.402 --> 00:10:38.242]  He's such a busy guy.
[00:10:38.302 --> 00:10:42.124]   He is credited as being The creator or the first podcaster.
[00:10:42.624 --> 00:10:50.606]  He's also a super smart guy and of course well known for being the number one host when they kicked off MTV back when it was the biggest thing in the world.
[00:10:50.966 --> 00:10:59.148]  And he joins us now for a 50-minute transmission, noagendashow.com to get into the entire waterfront.
[00:11:00.421 --> 00:11:02.820]   If you think I interrupt, Glenn Beck, I think is a great guy overall.
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.501]   He was really interrupting, but he was raising a lot of great points.
[00:11:05.501 --> 00:11:09.860]   But I wanted to get Adam on, this was Thursday I was listening and here he is on a Saturday,
[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:16.381]   to just have the floor and really be able to walk through all this because Adam obviously
[00:11:16.232 --> 00:11:18.272]  He has an amazing background as well.
[00:11:18.272 --> 00:11:21.192]   He had family very close to him that was a CIA section chief.
[00:11:21.192 --> 00:11:26.712]   So he has a whole background really growing up of understanding how the world really works
[00:11:26.712 --> 00:11:31.272]   and he's here with us to cover the midterms, January 6th, the whole waterfront.
[00:11:31.272 --> 00:11:32.271]  Adam, great to have you.
[00:11:32.271 --> 00:11:33.271]  Thanks for spending time with us.
[00:11:33.271 --> 00:11:34.271]  Yeah, sure, Alex.
[00:11:34.271 --> 00:11:35.271]  Always good to see you, man.
[00:11:35.271 --> 00:11:36.271]  Where do you want to start?
[00:11:36.271 --> 00:11:37.271]  I'm going to start with the midterms.
[00:11:37.579 --> 00:11:48.375]  Because I'm going to try to just shut up and let you roll, because the way you laid out the digital currencies, the way you lay out everything, I mean, I listen to the show routinely, but the way you laid it out on Glenn Beck was amazing, and I wanted to give you more time.
[00:11:50.312 --> 00:12:17.367]   Yeah, and I'm not a financial guy obviously I would say because of my interest in Bitcoin is kind of how I learn more and more about The financial system and this goes back to Ron Paul's and the Fed That's where I really started to understand what the Federal Reserve does and so and that's you know That's now what is it 15 years been quite a while since that book, but what I'm seeing Alex is a The way it's presented in the media, what's going on right now is upside down.
[00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:29.999]  What we continuously hear is because of Putin, because of the war in Ukraine, because of COVID, these are all the reasons that the financial system is in turmoil.
[00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:31.644]  But that's upside down.
[00:12:32.144 --> 00:12:35.446]  We have all of these things happening because of the financial system.
[00:12:36.407 --> 00:12:51.605]   And that's the part that frustrates me when I see how it's reported is all of this, all problems stem from the financial system as it is kind of I mean, it seems like it's coming to its end, this version of the system.
[00:12:51.625 --> 00:12:55.526]  And we've had many versions of financial systems for the United States dollar.
[00:12:56.567 --> 00:12:58.747]  We were at one point on the gold standard in the 70s.
[00:12:58.787 --> 00:13:00.708]  We were taken off the gold standard.
[00:13:01.088 --> 00:13:06.730]  And if you think the government won't mess with your money, I mean, there was an actual gold confiscation.
[00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:09.892]  It was illegal to have gold or gold coins.
[00:13:09.932 --> 00:13:10.792]  You had to give it up.
[00:13:10.872 --> 00:13:13.153]  So, you know, anything can change ultimately.
[00:13:14.541 --> 00:13:36.324]  But now we're in a world where I think unfortunately the money creation has just gotten out of control and that is truly, you know, the parameters for inflation are money creation and something called the velocity of money, so how fast people are spending money that they get into their hands.
[00:13:37.164 --> 00:13:48.590]  That has been bastardized and turned into something called, you know, the Consumer Price Index, and it only looks at the cost of gas and the cost of food.
[00:13:49.051 --> 00:13:50.611]  But really, that's not what the problem is.
[00:13:50.972 --> 00:13:53.693]  And of all the U.S.
[00:13:53.773 --> 00:13:59.514]   dollars ever created, ever brought into existence, Ever since the beginning.
[00:13:59.534 --> 00:14:03.077]  40% was created in the last two years.
[00:14:03.097 --> 00:14:15.405]  So, you know, when you have, and this is something that I did learn in high school, and I think everyone kind of agrees, if you have X amount of money and X amount of goods, you have, you know, there's price discovery.
[00:14:15.865 --> 00:14:20.809]  If everybody has a lot more money, then the prices will have to change.
[00:14:21.249 --> 00:14:23.750]  So it's the supply and demand.
[00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:29.271]  And we just got into this perfect situation, which now, in my opinion, is just being exasperated.
[00:14:29.291 --> 00:14:45.415]  And just to prove that it's a financial issue, the first thing that they did as this started, well, in my opinion, we probably shut down the economy as the first way to stop the bleeding, since hyperinflation can actually happen.
[00:14:46.215 --> 00:14:50.496]  And that was probably the main reason behind the COVID lockdowns.
[00:14:52.002 --> 00:14:57.407]  But then, you know, now we come out of this and there's no way to stop it.
[00:14:57.708 --> 00:15:00.410]  You can't get it under control.
[00:15:00.791 --> 00:15:06.016]  So we have to be able to control the money at a more granular level.
[00:15:06.416 --> 00:15:11.962]  And that is why you hear all this talk of the CBDC or the Central Bank Digital Currency.
[00:15:12.846 --> 00:15:15.929]  Because they'll tackle the problem from the opposite end.
[00:15:16.669 --> 00:15:25.376]  Whereas now they can really, you know, create and destroy dollars to manage inflation and thus somehow the economy and the prices.
[00:15:26.016 --> 00:15:32.381]  They want to now, in essence, have control over your money so they can remove money from you, small increments, you won't know it.
[00:15:32.982 --> 00:15:38.426]  Or, when they put money in, they can basically determine where it's going to be spent.
[00:15:39.126 --> 00:15:42.718]   And this And, you know, we'll have to get into the details.
[00:15:42.758 --> 00:15:51.836]  This all comes back in my mind to this drive towards the green, you know, carbon neutral or net neutral economy.
[00:15:53.423 --> 00:15:58.906]  That is now, and all the actions in the European Union, they're ahead of us right now.
[00:15:59.406 --> 00:16:02.088]  They are reigniting their carbon markets.
[00:16:02.668 --> 00:16:09.371]  So the basic concept is your money will be controlled based upon your carbon footprint.
[00:16:09.532 --> 00:16:22.098]  So you will be given personal responsibility to do the right thing if you want to access your money in the way that the government now in fact intends.
[00:16:22.888 --> 00:16:25.409]  Uh, and it sounds really far out there.
[00:16:25.709 --> 00:16:36.213]  And I don't know about you, Alex, but every single time I look at something and say, crap, they're doing this, like vaccines, you know, all these things, it kind of comes into play 10 years later.
[00:16:36.273 --> 00:16:38.134]  So I don't know if this is going to happen in 10 years.
[00:16:40.135 --> 00:16:46.520]  Powell, the chairman of the Fed, he said, well, you know, central bank digital currency, we're looking at it probably three years away.
[00:16:46.921 --> 00:16:55.648]  But Christine Lagarde, who was the Powell of the European Central Bank, she made it sound recently at Atlantic Council interview, like it was kind of happening.
[00:16:56.268 --> 00:17:05.696]  And and what was creepy there is she said the way they're pitching this is credit cards track you.
[00:17:06.885 --> 00:17:14.616]  Credit cards build a profile of you and these are exploited commercially to sell things to you and know what you're doing.
[00:17:14.977 --> 00:17:18.062]  And she says our central bank digital currency, it won't do that.
[00:17:20.198 --> 00:17:24.924]  Not that they won't be tracking and building a profile of you, but they won't sell it to commercial companies.
[00:17:25.485 --> 00:17:27.568]  But the government could do a heck of a lot with that.
[00:17:27.668 --> 00:17:36.740]  So this digital twin profile, they want to build that and they want to know who you are and subsequently how to control you.
[00:17:37.862 --> 00:17:43.206]  And you walked through that when I heard you on the radio the other day, and you made the point, this is not your opinion.
[00:17:43.666 --> 00:17:47.609]  This is not something that's just we're surmising they could do this.
[00:17:47.649 --> 00:18:00.419]  They're saying in these IMF, World Bank, Federal Reserve, and also BlackRock statements that also what the Bank of England came out about a month ago, I guess now two months ago, and said, oh, we're going to program the tokens.
[00:18:01.099 --> 00:18:05.301]  And we're going to program these new digital systems, and we'll decide when you can spend it, how you can spend it.
[00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:08.242]  We'll put it in your account, and then maybe it has two days.
[00:18:08.583 --> 00:18:14.745]  That way we can have stimulus, or we can take some of the value out of it if we want to slow things down.
[00:18:14.765 --> 00:18:32.999]   I mean, this is total surveillance, total control, and you bring in the SEGs, With all these big private corporations and banks and BlackRock and then central banks admitting that they're also going to tell you where you can spend it and how you can spend it, quote, for the environment, but really it's to send the money right back to themselves.
[00:18:34.762 --> 00:18:35.943]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:18:36.543 --> 00:18:41.527]  Yes, the environmental social governance regulations that kind of came out of nowhere.
[00:18:41.567 --> 00:18:45.449]  I think, you know, I really started tuning into it about a year ago.
[00:18:45.469 --> 00:18:47.350]  It's like, wow, this thing is real.
[00:18:47.771 --> 00:19:05.019]   They, in essence, made their own ranking system and their own little way of determining if you as a company are good at environmental goals, if you're good at social goals, which would be your woke culture and governance, which is also a part of
[00:19:05.019 --> 00:19:09.240]   that, making sure you have equity everywhere.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:15.839]   And so they make up their own rules and determine what is environmentally or socially or what
[00:19:15.839 --> 00:19:18.559]  is friendly.
[00:19:18.559 --> 00:19:22.798]   And since they make the rules, they can in essence determine who's going to get investments
[00:19:22.798 --> 00:19:24.298]  or not.
[00:19:24.298 --> 00:19:29.618]   Because when you look at the true investment market out in Wall Street, it's pension funds.
[00:19:29.618 --> 00:19:33.619]  These are the biggest ones, pension funds, retirement funds.
[00:19:33.543 --> 00:19:35.864]  And they're the ones that are then making these decisions.
[00:19:35.984 --> 00:19:49.648]  And if the so-called rules, which just kind of came into existence like many other rules in our country, say, well, you know, you can't invest in fracking, you can't invest in pipelines or anything of this nature, then that investment won't go in there.
[00:19:50.688 --> 00:19:54.609]  And this, to me, it feels also like there's a lot of subplots here.
[00:19:54.629 --> 00:20:02.729]   As you know, right now, Europe is, and I have a lot of friends who live there, is really It's chaos.
[00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:08.311]  People's energy bills, just for electricity, have doubled in Germany.
[00:20:08.331 --> 00:20:10.872]  They're close to quadrupling in the UK as well.
[00:20:10.892 --> 00:20:13.533]  You know, this gets people's attention.
[00:20:14.073 --> 00:20:19.075]  And so they're focused on, oh, it's because of Ukraine, it's because of Putin, they throw all that out there.
[00:20:19.135 --> 00:20:26.418]  But, you know, really, it's your fault because, you know, we shouldn't be using these horrible things to heat our home or to cook with.
[00:20:27.478 --> 00:20:33.260]  But at the same time, the solutions they have, which is wind and solar, aren't sufficient, may never be sufficient.
[00:20:33.601 --> 00:20:34.601]  And so they're not working.
[00:20:34.641 --> 00:20:40.503]  So now there's this push and they're going to do everything to shame us into it being our fault.
[00:20:41.604 --> 00:20:42.544]  And I think it's working.
[00:20:42.684 --> 00:20:45.145]  And you see people are just zombifying.
[00:20:45.185 --> 00:20:46.265]  They're starting to shut down.
[00:20:46.345 --> 00:20:48.626]  Okay, whatever you say, we'll just do it.
[00:20:49.006 --> 00:20:50.047]  We'll go along with it.
[00:20:50.707 --> 00:20:55.869]  And that's when you introduce your carbon footprint.
[00:20:56.569 --> 00:20:58.331]  And this is where it's going to get interesting.
[00:20:58.871 --> 00:21:00.192]  Just listen to what they're saying.
[00:21:00.412 --> 00:21:05.175]  Meat is bad because of methane that is emitted from cow farts and burps.
[00:21:06.316 --> 00:21:14.302]  So if you're eating meat, they're going to calculate your portion of the fart, your portion of the burp, and how much greenhouse gas that is.
[00:21:14.342 --> 00:21:21.747]  And that's going to be marked up somewhere on your chart, which will be directly calculable against what you can or can't do without your money.
[00:21:21.807 --> 00:21:24.049]  And it doesn't, I mean, it sounds futuristic.
[00:21:24.631 --> 00:21:30.813]  But China, of course, already does this to a certain degree with WeChat and that's what the kind of platform is there.
[00:21:31.634 --> 00:21:44.539]  And, you know, when I think about the government being stupid and being backwards and the true meaning of the term retarded, they actually are backwards.
[00:21:44.639 --> 00:21:45.439]  It's not really true.
[00:21:45.479 --> 00:21:51.922]  I think that you look at DARPA and these guys, you know, they were testing the effects of social networking in the 70s.
[00:21:52.922 --> 00:21:59.404]  So when it comes to a central bank digital currency, I have a feeling they have a lot more knowledge and have been working on this for a long time.
[00:21:59.424 --> 00:22:11.307]  And there's been, you know, tons of rumors about different types of financial systems, different altcoins that were supposed to, you know, like XRP or Ripple that was supposed to be this backbone.
[00:22:11.327 --> 00:22:16.488]  All of that seems unlikely, but it seems very likely they do have a plan and they've probably had that for a long time.
[00:22:16.988 --> 00:22:22.891]   The question is, what event will we need It's really just stunning to be at this moment.
[00:22:22.911 --> 00:22:24.131]  Adam Curry is our guest here.
[00:22:24.232 --> 00:22:26.293]  I'm just sitting back thinking about this.
[00:22:26.313 --> 00:22:28.254]  Let's just talk about food for a moment.
[00:22:28.073 --> 00:22:33.433]   I mean, the most shocking one was the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines.
[00:22:33.433 --> 00:22:34.433]  That's a big deal.
[00:22:34.433 --> 00:22:40.113]  That'll have its own Wikipedia page in the future.
[00:22:40.113 --> 00:22:43.273]  It's really just stunning to be at this moment.
[00:22:43.273 --> 00:22:44.632]  Adam Curry is our guest here.
[00:22:44.632 --> 00:22:46.432]  I'm just sitting back thinking about this.
[00:22:46.432 --> 00:22:49.033]  Let's just talk about food for a moment.
[00:22:49.033 --> 00:22:56.592]   You have a massive global inflation after all the stimulus, not just by the U.S., but
[00:22:56.592 --> 00:23:00.993]   dozens of other major nations, that did it, hundreds of smaller countries.
[00:23:01.403 --> 00:23:14.371]  You have people paid for several years in the third world, that is, the governments were paid IMF and World Bank money to just shut down their economies that's now caused mass starvation and collapsed the third world, now flooding via the U.N.
[00:23:14.391 --> 00:23:17.073]  refugee centers into Europe and into the U.S.
[00:23:17.233 --> 00:23:18.634]  and Canada, North America.
[00:23:19.674 --> 00:23:26.940]  And then you have in the Netherlands and many other places like Australia ordering people to get rid of a certain amount of their sheep and cows.
[00:23:27.421 --> 00:23:29.723]  By 2030, they want it to be 90% of them.
[00:23:29.743 --> 00:23:31.985]  That's why the farmers are obviously protesting.
[00:23:32.645 --> 00:23:34.527]  You have the fertilizer prices exploding.
[00:23:35.147 --> 00:23:40.932]  And you look at these numbers, the UN World Food Chief just said last week, this is going to be hell on earth.
[00:23:42.213 --> 00:23:44.535]  Hundreds of millions could starve to death, probably will.
[00:23:44.875 --> 00:23:58.369]   We already know in the last few years of lockdown, Yes, and they have a plan for this.
[00:23:59.389 --> 00:24:06.091]  A couple years ago, I met a guy called Texas Slim, who was starting something called the Beef Initiative, beefinitiative.com.
[00:24:06.811 --> 00:24:08.652]  And it was really interesting.
[00:24:08.692 --> 00:24:13.073]  He says, Adam, you know, you have to understand, we need some real food intelligence.
[00:24:13.093 --> 00:24:14.153]  I'm like, food intelligence?
[00:24:14.173 --> 00:24:14.973]  What are you talking about?
[00:24:15.033 --> 00:24:34.501]   So as he kind of lifted the veil for me, In 2018, the final consolidation of Big Ag and pharmaceuticals, you know, we had Bayer and Monsanto and all these big mega mergers, that was kind of when everyone decided, when those guys decided, you know, here we go, we're moving towards new food.
[00:24:35.322 --> 00:24:38.483]  And this, of course, has not gone unnoticed.
[00:24:38.963 --> 00:24:51.107]   The idea is, since meat is bad for you and bad for the environment, and the PSYOP is also that it's been bad for you, this has been Something that's been jammed into people's heads for many, many decades.
[00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:58.062]  You are going to eat meat alternatives and you need your protein, so it'll be soy, plant-based products.
[00:24:58.586 --> 00:25:04.385]   as well as insects for protein, and that's already kind of slipping in.
[00:25:04.385 --> 00:25:09.967]   And in a way, you get Nicole Kidman eating some bugs on camera, part of the obvious promotion,
[00:25:09.967 --> 00:25:11.386]  but really they've already slipped it in.
[00:25:11.386 --> 00:25:17.547]   It's just, it has different names, cricket powders and all kinds of flower products already.
[00:25:17.547 --> 00:25:22.666]   But what is interesting is, particularly in the United States,
[00:25:22.666 --> 00:25:30.346]   the food industry, when it comes to animal protein, is really, it's a cartel of four major food processors.
[00:25:30.305 --> 00:25:34.229]  So it's JBS, it's Cargill, it's two others.
[00:25:35.713 --> 00:25:41.833]   ranchers and farmers, but let's talk about ranchers for a second, have been really removed
[00:25:41.833 --> 00:25:43.153]  from the consumer.
[00:25:43.153 --> 00:25:49.173]   So it's almost like commodity cowboys where we raise our cattle and then whenever the
[00:25:49.173 --> 00:25:53.592]   processing plant says we can take them, whether they're ready or not, whether they could grow
[00:25:53.592 --> 00:25:56.114]  more, they go.
[00:25:56.114 --> 00:25:59.374]  It's completely out of the ranchers' hands at this point.
[00:25:59.374 --> 00:26:00.752]  Then the processing takes place.
[00:26:00.752 --> 00:26:05.213]   And what's interesting in Texas, most of our Texas beef, that's not what's in HEB, that's
[00:26:05.213 --> 00:26:11.393]   not in our local supermarket chain, that's sold off very high prices to restaurants and
[00:26:11.393 --> 00:26:00.735]   countries all over the world where the elites eat our beef Then the processing takes place.
[00:26:00.735 --> 00:26:05.014]   And what's interesting in Texas, most of our Texas beef, that's not what's in HEB,
[00:26:05.014 --> 00:26:06.776]  that's not in our local supermarket chain.
[00:26:06.776 --> 00:26:12.375]   That's sold off very high prices to restaurants and countries all over the world
[00:26:12.375 --> 00:26:14.055]  where the elites eat our beef.
[00:26:14.055 --> 00:26:20.375]   And what we're getting is cattle that's been, either it's been processed and slaughtered in Australia
[00:26:20.375 --> 00:26:26.375]   and it's been frozen, has been in transit for a while, and who knows what inputs are going into that
[00:26:26.375 --> 00:26:29.815]  before it finally reaches your kitchen.
[00:26:29.815 --> 00:26:34.336]   Or we're getting it from the cattle drive from South America, which includes, I think,
[00:26:34.336 --> 00:26:38.815]   10 different touch points of the cattle before they're finally up here and taken to slaughter.
[00:26:38.815 --> 00:26:40.855]  So we're not really eating good food.
[00:26:40.851 --> 00:26:42.531]  That was a famous joke with McDonald's even in the 80s.
[00:26:42.611 --> 00:26:44.192]  It was a big investigation.
[00:26:44.812 --> 00:26:50.254]  The burgers would say all American beef on the wrapper, while all American, Brazilian and Argentinian beef.
[00:26:51.314 --> 00:26:52.314]  Correct, correct.
[00:26:52.474 --> 00:26:54.975]  And just because it says USDA, I mean it's all lies.
[00:26:55.055 --> 00:26:58.156]  All the packaging, it's all meant to obfuscate the truth.
[00:26:58.775 --> 00:27:04.043]  So the bottom line is, as Americans, we're not eating food.
[00:27:04.264 --> 00:27:06.207]  We really are not eating food.
[00:27:06.247 --> 00:27:10.093]  And we don't know it because it all looks good and it tastes good.
[00:27:10.649 --> 00:27:13.050]  You know, you used to hear, oh, processed food, that's bad for you.
[00:27:13.711 --> 00:27:14.951]  Yeah, it's not even food.
[00:27:15.011 --> 00:27:17.213]  I didn't really realize it myself, to be honest.
[00:27:17.933 --> 00:27:30.780]  But then when you start consuming real beef, you can get it directly from a rancher, which is what the Beef Initiative is trying to do, to connect consumers to ranchers again and create this parallel economy.
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:39.866]   That's the only way out because the plan, and also it's not hidden, the plan is Less actual animal protein, more synthetics.
[00:27:40.027 --> 00:27:41.948]  And let me just back you up on this.
[00:27:42.008 --> 00:27:50.296]  Just a few weeks ago there were a bunch of articles from the WEF, from Bill Gates, saying to fight climate change we need ultra-processed food.
[00:27:50.717 --> 00:27:58.204]  And then the FDA came out a few months ago and said we're not going to even regulate nanotech in food.
[00:27:59.045 --> 00:28:01.307]  That was a finding where we just don't have a jurisdiction.
[00:28:01.727 --> 00:28:03.869]  So this is really a transhumanist revolution.
[00:28:04.129 --> 00:28:10.194]  You got Gates, the biggest private farm owner in the United States, talking about his magic GMO seeds.
[00:28:10.494 --> 00:28:14.057]  I mean, this really is a corporate takeover of the entire infrastructure.
[00:28:14.077 --> 00:28:17.580]  Can you elaborate on your in-depth research and perspective on that, Adam Curry?
[00:28:19.501 --> 00:28:22.103]  Yeah, I would say, here's an interesting one.
[00:28:22.143 --> 00:28:24.085]  You know, you mentioned the Netherlands and the farmers.
[00:28:24.105 --> 00:28:25.266]  Well, I grew up in the Netherlands.
[00:28:25.366 --> 00:28:30.110]  I moved there from the States when I was seven and actually went through the Dutch schooling system.
[00:28:31.792 --> 00:28:38.956]  I've been there for quite a while and know a lot about it and also know a lot of the farmers and everything you've heard is absolutely true.
[00:28:38.996 --> 00:28:51.663]  You know, the whole idea of this net zero is to create this huge city which would consist of the Netherlands, the Benelux, essentially Belgium.
[00:28:51.703 --> 00:28:53.304]  I think they'll add a piece of Germany to that.
[00:28:53.664 --> 00:29:01.669]  And that'll be this big bedroom community where everybody, I guess, goes to work or they zoom in to work and all the farm production is supposed to diminish.
[00:29:01.689 --> 00:29:03.311]  That's where, you know, you need that for housing.
[00:29:03.351 --> 00:29:04.271]  It's a very small country.
[00:29:04.311 --> 00:29:05.452]  It's the size of Rhode Island.
[00:29:05.792 --> 00:29:07.473]  They have 17 million people living there.
[00:29:08.334 --> 00:29:21.730]   But what was surprising, since they are, you know, very famous and very big in their animal and other farm exports, Is that this company that I grew up with called Royal DSM.
[00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:28.216]  Royal DSM was a royal because of the Dutch royal family's investment like Royal Dutch Shell.
[00:29:28.576 --> 00:29:30.038]  DSM was a chemical company.
[00:29:30.058 --> 00:29:36.364]  It was just it was a chemical big chemical processing company.
[00:29:37.231 --> 00:29:46.196]  And I woke up one day and I looked around and I'm reading about, you know, food and processing stuff and I see DSM acquired some company, go take a look.
[00:29:46.657 --> 00:29:48.358]  These guys have completely transformed.
[00:29:48.538 --> 00:29:59.744]  Now with 8 billion euros in revenue every year, they are the largest supplier to the world of processed food, i.e.
[00:29:59.825 --> 00:30:05.468]  bugs, soy and plants, of taste and texture products.
[00:30:06.405 --> 00:30:07.105]  And that's it.
[00:30:07.605 --> 00:30:11.887]  That's the key there, is it tastes good.
[00:30:12.207 --> 00:30:13.107]  It tastes right.
[00:30:13.288 --> 00:30:14.188]  It feels right.
[00:30:14.268 --> 00:30:14.828]  We don't care.
[00:30:14.868 --> 00:30:18.429]  As Americans, we really are not good at recognizing food.
[00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:23.411]  And it's hard because they're really making this stuff look and taste the way it should.
[00:30:23.671 --> 00:30:25.892]  And even the way, what's not even natural.
[00:30:26.092 --> 00:30:28.353]  They do lots of tests to make sure that you're going to like it.
[00:30:28.931 --> 00:30:38.099]  And this is what's made us sick, and I look at the statistics, 47% of all children in America are at least pre-diabetic.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:44.705]  I mean, that's a genocide, absolutely.
[00:30:45.105 --> 00:30:52.872]  And part of this stems from, and the same people around from climate change, it all goes back to the population bomb.
[00:30:53.476 --> 00:31:06.384]  And Dvorak and I talk about this all the time on the show, you know, in the 70s there was a book that came out and everyone was freaking out, and this is likely the genesis of the Georgia Guidestones, is we need, you know, we need less people on the planet.
[00:31:06.424 --> 00:31:07.285]  How are we going to do that?
[00:31:07.305 --> 00:31:16.191]   I mean, the eugenics movement in the United States, which is rarely discussed, But man, you know, Hitler was writing fan letters to the people who were involved in that.
[00:31:17.752 --> 00:31:27.099]  It's very embarrassing and very little known about how... I mean, we had beautiful baby contests at state fairs, you know, to show, hey, look, this is my perfect baby.
[00:31:27.159 --> 00:31:34.424]  And, you know, after, you know, you look at some of these less perfect human beings, we got rid of them.
[00:31:34.444 --> 00:31:38.367]  Well, to be clear, Hitler got eugenics from the UK and the United States.
[00:31:38.707 --> 00:31:40.849]  So, Adam Curry, big picture here.
[00:31:42.762 --> 00:31:45.704]  The globalists want to scientifically control all of human aspects.
[00:31:45.724 --> 00:31:48.705]  They said they're building a transhumanist post-human world.
[00:31:49.286 --> 00:31:50.987]  How do all these factors come together?
[00:31:51.167 --> 00:31:54.409]  And where do you think, from their own admissions, they're trying to take us?
[00:31:54.549 --> 00:31:57.791]  And how is their operation to get us there going?
[00:31:57.811 --> 00:32:06.996]  If this was a football game, pro-freedom folks versus the technocracy, team freedom versus team demon, how's humanity doing right now?
[00:32:10.111 --> 00:32:10.912]  How's humanity?
[00:32:11.112 --> 00:32:13.813]  Well, humanity is not licked by a long shot.
[00:32:14.053 --> 00:32:19.155]  They wouldn't have to put so much into propagandizing us if they had it all figured out.
[00:32:19.215 --> 00:32:21.496]  In fact, it's really not a football game.
[00:32:21.536 --> 00:32:23.077]  I don't think there's any finesse to it.
[00:32:23.117 --> 00:32:26.418]  They're going with sledgehammers, and the sledgehammers are money and food.
[00:32:26.798 --> 00:32:27.239]  That's all.
[00:32:27.619 --> 00:32:28.059]  I agree.
[00:32:28.119 --> 00:32:32.021]  It is just brute force controlling the infrastructure attack.
[00:32:32.281 --> 00:32:34.662]  And the solution is, we already see it happening.
[00:32:35.402 --> 00:32:38.604]  A hundred years ago, 90% of people were rural, 10% were urban.
[00:32:39.625 --> 00:32:46.430]  Today, 90% are urban, 10% are rural, but we're seeing a mass exodus back to the country and people rediscovering local communities.
[00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:50.153]  The UN talks about sustainability, but what they're pushing is the opposite.
[00:32:50.773 --> 00:32:53.135]  We need real sustainability, and that means local community.
[00:32:54.336 --> 00:32:58.259]  That's the only way to go, and all of our problems stem from this.
[00:32:59.443 --> 00:33:11.889]  It's like our education system, and I'll take some blame for that, because in the 80s and 90s when we were coming up, and I'm now 58, you know, party time, making a career, having a good time.
[00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:16.311]  I was in New York, it was fantastic.
[00:33:16.431 --> 00:33:23.915]  School board, you know, clearly some loser who couldn't get a better gig, they're on the school board, you know.
[00:33:23.955 --> 00:33:26.896]  Local city council, yeah, whatever, so we weren't paying attention.
[00:33:27.859 --> 00:33:31.874]  And that's where a lot of problems crept in, so that has to be dealt with locally.
[00:33:31.914 --> 00:33:32.657]  But before that...
[00:33:33.383 --> 00:33:49.055]  And I know it sounds like doomsday, but it's important that you find a rancher or, you know, whether it's beef or hog or chickens and farmers, although I think you can probably get away with just animal protein if it really gets bad.
[00:33:49.315 --> 00:33:53.458]  You need to go shake their hand, go find out, you know, how they operate.
[00:33:53.518 --> 00:33:55.240]  Will they sell directly to you?
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:58.042]  These are things you just need to do for your family.
[00:33:58.482 --> 00:34:04.497]  Just, you know, it's not enough to have rice and whatever else people are storing.
[00:34:04.758 --> 00:34:15.231]   You really need to have To have access to, in my opinion, to animal protein, good, pure animal protein, which really starts with the source, which is the seed.
[00:34:15.632 --> 00:34:21.736]  And so the farmers and the ranchers that are clued into this, they don't have Monsanto grass.
[00:34:21.856 --> 00:34:31.343]  And not only that, but here in Texas, they're starting to go back to their old processes that they learned from their grandparents.
[00:34:31.382 --> 00:34:34.582]   And by the way, for the folks that don't know, every ancient culture, whether it was the
[00:34:34.582 --> 00:34:39.821]   Hindus 3,000 plus years ago or the Jews 3,000 plus years ago, when you read the Vedic text
[00:34:39.821 --> 00:34:45.502]   or the Old Testament, it's God then made the grass for the cows to eat, and that gave us
[00:34:45.502 --> 00:34:46.502]  the wealth.
[00:34:46.502 --> 00:34:50.143]   And then Moses says, you know, in Exodus, "Stop worshipping the golden calf," because
[00:34:50.143 --> 00:34:51.202]  that's what they were worshipping.
[00:34:51.202 --> 00:34:57.502]   But people know beef and the protein in it, what it does when it's not been burned, makes
[00:34:57.502 --> 00:34:59.782]  us stronger, makes our hearts better, our brains better.
[00:35:00.113 --> 00:35:10.841]  Humans have basically developed into what we are with bigger heads, larger brains, healthier, longer-lived because we went from being mainly a herbivore to an omnivore to a carnivore.
[00:35:11.041 --> 00:35:13.283]  And that's in all the real science studies, they know it.
[00:35:13.623 --> 00:35:22.051]  And you take away red meat, clean, healthy red meat from people, you literally emasculate them, you dumb them down, lower IQs in children, everything.
[00:35:22.331 --> 00:35:29.658]  We are a transitional species going carnivorous, and they're trying to take us out of that because it has immediate effects from just mainline research.
[00:35:29.838 --> 00:35:30.599]  Can you elaborate on that?
[00:35:31.966 --> 00:35:41.372]  Well, I agree with that, and I think it was Jordan Peterson who said that once we discovered fire and we were cooking our meat, our bellies shrank and our heads grew.
[00:35:41.392 --> 00:35:48.721]   And by the way, there's I've been looking for this study and I haven't found it.
[00:35:49.021 --> 00:35:53.546]  It seems to have disappeared, but at the time when I saw it, it looked like it was pretty legit.
[00:35:53.927 --> 00:35:57.551]  A study in Japan about something called soy rage.
[00:35:57.771 --> 00:36:04.636]   If you're not feeding good healthy protein to your children's brains, You know, weird stuff can start to happen.
[00:36:04.856 --> 00:36:20.065]  And now we have to get into the medication of our children, which is so flabbergasting how quickly this went from some Ritalin 20 years ago to now Adderall, Vyvanse.
[00:36:20.105 --> 00:36:26.168]  These are just standard things that kids trade in the schoolyard.
[00:36:27.108 --> 00:36:34.409]  Every, you know, the percentage of children on anti-anxiety medication is astounding.
[00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:40.731]  And so, I'm not quite sure what we do with the current generation.
[00:36:40.771 --> 00:36:41.051]  Absolutely.
[00:36:41.071 --> 00:36:42.251]  Let me just pause you there.
[00:36:42.311 --> 00:36:44.231]  Let me just interrupt the famous Alex Jones interruption.
[00:36:44.611 --> 00:36:46.112]  Adam Curry kicking ass here with us today.
[00:36:46.132 --> 00:36:48.372]  Really appreciate him joining us on this Saturday morning.
[00:36:48.392 --> 00:36:52.313]  We're going to air this later in the day and then later this week we're going to air it on the main show.
[00:36:52.533 --> 00:36:53.553]  Let's get into the medications.
[00:36:54.798 --> 00:37:02.083]  When you mentioned the soy study, there's actually one out of Italy, there's one out of Canada, there's a big one out of Japan you just mentioned.
[00:37:02.363 --> 00:37:04.004]  We actually just found it, we'll put it on screen.
[00:37:04.465 --> 00:37:21.576]  But it turned out that the burgers, the veggie burgers that Gates was putting out in stores, people were rejecting them, and also the one that Burger King was going to put out, literally had more soy in one patty than what someone gendered transitioning would take of estrogen.
[00:37:21.916 --> 00:37:23.137]  And so I saw those articles.
[00:37:24.498 --> 00:37:26.060]  I ate one of them just to see what it would do.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.622]  I literally got sick and threw up three hours later.
[00:37:29.083 --> 00:37:36.730]  So we already know the food's weaponized, but this bombing men with soy feminizes men, the studies show, and hyperfeminizes girls.
[00:37:37.131 --> 00:37:38.712]  That's why what girls used to go into puberty at 12.
[00:37:39.941 --> 00:37:40.861]  Now the average is nine.
[00:37:41.161 --> 00:37:47.163]  They have three-year-olds going into puberty and it's directly tied to the plastics, the bisphenol A, but also the soy.
[00:37:47.183 --> 00:37:52.745]  So let's just back up what you said and put the study back on screen that you're absolutely right, Adam Curry, about soy rage.
[00:37:53.765 --> 00:38:02.488]  And you see these men that are on it and how they look crazy and just act so bizarre because literally they are mainlining estrogen, plant-based estrogen.
[00:38:02.508 --> 00:38:02.908]  There it is.
[00:38:04.468 --> 00:38:05.369]  I'm glad you found that.
[00:38:05.389 --> 00:38:06.989]  Some PubMed, I'm glad you found that.
[00:38:10.535 --> 00:38:32.470]   You know, there's a lot at play here, you know, take into account that according to the mainstream and according to The political left, you know, the most horrible, dangerous, hated people in the United States certainly are white cis, there you go, so white straight men.
[00:38:33.571 --> 00:38:38.814]  This is, you can't just add, men are complicated and simple at the same time.
[00:38:40.575 --> 00:38:44.417]  But men have some very specific needs that are not being met.
[00:38:44.517 --> 00:38:51.135]   In fact, men are checking out, young men are checking out Just in general, in amazing numbers.
[00:38:52.055 --> 00:39:06.587]  Now, with all of this, Alex, I have to say there's so much hope and so much goodness because we don't have to fall into, we don't have to follow their systems, we don't have to use their systems, we don't have to buy their fake food.
[00:39:06.987 --> 00:39:10.230]  And we're going to talk about solutions, I totally agree, but we have to identify the problem.
[00:39:10.931 --> 00:39:11.851]  And you're really smart guys.
[00:39:11.871 --> 00:39:13.613]  We got time here, you know, commercial free.
[00:39:14.868 --> 00:39:16.851]  Lay it out for us, but men need a mission.
[00:39:17.231 --> 00:39:18.193]  Men need a tribe.
[00:39:18.333 --> 00:39:19.234]  Men need a culture.
[00:39:19.594 --> 00:39:20.896]  Men need to feel needed.
[00:39:21.256 --> 00:39:29.026]  And when men are told, you're worthless, you're bad, you're cancer, they go and blow their heads off, or they drink themselves to death, or they just play video games all day.
[00:39:29.427 --> 00:39:33.492]  Men need to have a mission, and the world has told men, you're obsolete.
[00:39:33.912 --> 00:39:35.013]  And women, you're in charge.
[00:39:35.053 --> 00:39:45.041]  But really, if you read Yuval Noah Harari and the rest of them, they say, actually, the post-human era is in 2047, and humans are obsolete, and humans are not in the future.
[00:39:45.321 --> 00:39:46.302]  The future is not human.
[00:39:46.322 --> 00:39:53.547]  And I think a lot of women, we see the numbers, are actually waking up to that now and realizing that Gloria Steinem was CIA, culture engineering.
[00:39:53.887 --> 00:39:55.248]  None of this was in power women.
[00:39:55.469 --> 00:39:56.950]  So spend some time on that.
[00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:59.612]  Talk about the problem with men and what men need.
[00:40:03.138 --> 00:40:13.585]  Well, I mean, I don't know if I'm qualified to say that, but I am qualified to see the observations.
[00:40:14.226 --> 00:40:21.110]  Let me tell you about the men that I'm working with, and the young men, I'm talking millennials, so around 30, could be a little younger, could be a little older.
[00:40:22.031 --> 00:40:26.574]  They were born around 1990, which was a very complicated time.
[00:40:28.395 --> 00:40:31.816]  Actually, it was a complicated media time because we had the first Gulf War.
[00:40:31.876 --> 00:40:41.120]  CNN was, at that point, hilarious if we go back and take a look at some of the green screen and fakery and stuff, although what was happening there was real.
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:48.202]  And I remember sitting with my daughter, you know, in her little rocker there, just watching this day in, day out.
[00:40:48.302 --> 00:40:51.023]  It was quite a television experience.
[00:40:51.938 --> 00:40:56.600]  So they grew up with that, then around, you know, middle school, we have 9-11 now.
[00:40:57.701 --> 00:40:58.721]  That's traumatic.
[00:40:58.921 --> 00:41:06.765]  It was traumatic for the world and you can only imagine how that sets certain brains into motion and how they, or how they look at things.
[00:41:07.765 --> 00:41:09.826]  It's very, you know, very young, very impressionable.
[00:41:10.858 --> 00:41:29.123]  Then, you know, then we went into, we invaded the wrong country, you know, there was anthrax, yellow cake, aluminum tubes, weapons of mass destruction, lots of imagery, imagery, imagery that just was so destructive and damaging, I think, to that generation.
[00:41:30.063 --> 00:41:31.644]  But it's okay, we're gonna find him.
[00:41:31.984 --> 00:41:38.966]  It'll all be fine, you know, and then that moves on a little bit, and then we get to the financial crisis.
[00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:55.140]  Meanwhile, this generation is now in school, in college, many of them, and they've taken out loans to get the education they say is their guaranteed ticket, which has been another marketing exercise to say, yeah, don't, just get this degree and you'll be good to go.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:55.801]  They came out.
[00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:12.469]  Just as the financial collapse, the last time we went through this, which is kind of the reason why we're here today with the financial system, and everything fell apart and they saw families having to move.
[00:42:12.709 --> 00:42:14.911]  That was quite a disastrous couple of years, 2008-2009.
[00:42:17.447 --> 00:42:23.653]  And there they were with their college degrees, and it's like, well, you know, this is what you got, $12 an hour.
[00:42:23.773 --> 00:42:24.634]  Congratulations.
[00:42:25.615 --> 00:42:28.578]  Or you can maybe drive an Uber or, you know, the gig economy.
[00:42:29.219 --> 00:42:33.503]  And then, you know, the social contract was kind of broken.
[00:42:34.615 --> 00:42:35.996]  That's not what was supposed to happen.
[00:42:36.316 --> 00:42:40.398]  Now throw some COVID and lockdown at them and now you see the result.
[00:42:40.438 --> 00:42:44.220]  The demoralization is incredible across the board.
[00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:57.948]  We have quiet quitting, we have all these different things that people are doing and I think in a way also positive because people are re-evaluating their lives and this is a real positive.
[00:42:59.129 --> 00:43:06.355]  Where, if you worked at any company, any company that had Slack inside its organization, you were not working 9 to 5.
[00:43:06.615 --> 00:43:19.826]  You were working 24-7 because that had become the culture of our corporate economy, is always be on call, ready to answer the Slack message, ready to hop on a Zoom call, do anything.
[00:43:19.906 --> 00:43:25.769]   And I believe that That people are re-evaluating their lives and saying, no, no, no, that's just not worth it to me.
[00:43:26.229 --> 00:43:32.431]  And seeing as they came from $12 an hour, they're probably willing to, you know, to give up a little now that we're at $20 an hour.
[00:43:33.351 --> 00:43:36.292]  So this is a pullback in enthusiasm.
[00:43:36.492 --> 00:43:37.432]  Oh, yes, I'm sorry.
[00:43:37.732 --> 00:43:41.154]  And we're all going to die by 2030, thanks to climate change.
[00:43:41.434 --> 00:43:42.354]  I mean, what do you expect?
[00:43:44.113 --> 00:43:44.533]  Exactly.
[00:43:44.553 --> 00:43:56.463]  They're trying to get humanity to give up and roll over, but then BlackRock and Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan in the last year have sent threatening emails out that are public to their employees saying, if you don't start working four days a week in the office, you're fired.
[00:43:56.803 --> 00:44:08.552]  So they told everybody else to quit, to get Main Street to quit, to get the small farmers to quit so they can consolidate and vertically integrate the economy, but now even their own minions are quitting and the robot revolution hasn't shown up on time to replace us yet.
[00:44:10.909 --> 00:44:17.433]  Well, I don't know when the robot revolution will come in, but you're absolutely right.
[00:44:18.334 --> 00:44:28.001]  And there's no reporting, there's no real analysis of some of these systems that have been broken because of this and also mandatory vaccinations.
[00:44:28.661 --> 00:44:32.804]  The most important one for the United States is our aviation system.
[00:44:33.124 --> 00:44:34.084]  The system is broken.
[00:44:34.484 --> 00:44:42.627]  It is completely broken because pilots and aircrew, other aircrew and ground crew, the system, but pilots, you really need pilots to fly.
[00:44:43.647 --> 00:44:50.369]  Many of them would not accept the vaccine into their life and so they either retired early or they quit, went to do so.
[00:44:50.449 --> 00:44:51.949]  I know pilots who are ranchers now.
[00:44:53.890 --> 00:45:01.672]  And then there was, there's a large contingent who literally can no longer be certified to fly because they have side effects.
[00:45:02.774 --> 00:45:04.935]  Such as myocarditis and other heart issues.
[00:45:05.595 --> 00:45:16.117]  And it's not that simple to train a pilot to be a commercial airline aviator.
[00:45:17.638 --> 00:45:19.658]  And the same thing holds true there.
[00:45:20.178 --> 00:45:24.620]  If you studied and you got your pilots, I'm a pilot, I fly helicopters and fixed wing.
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:28.000]  Just my own, not commercially obviously.
[00:45:29.281 --> 00:45:33.720]   If you want to become a pilot, you're going to spend probably, you could
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:38.521]   easily spend $40,000, but it's more like $140,000 to become a commercial airline pilot.
[00:45:38.521 --> 00:45:44.521]   You're going to have that loan that you're paying off, and you're going to get in, if you're lucky, into a regional
[00:45:44.521 --> 00:45:48.021]   airline, you're going to be making $35,000, $40,000 a year.
[00:45:48.021 --> 00:45:53.781]   And now we've seen all these headlines of, "We're going to fire our white pilots and hire minority pilots,"
[00:45:53.781 --> 00:45:56.481]  when we're talking about a 3, 4, 5, 10-year learning curve.
[00:45:56.481 --> 00:45:58.441]  Just the time you invest is insane.
[00:45:58.458 --> 00:46:04.981]  I don't want to interrupt you, but I don't want to get accused of trying to cover up for Big Pharma and Prozac and the mass murder pills.
[00:46:05.301 --> 00:46:15.306]  Let's go back to that segue where I interrupted you to get back into food, and let's hit the drugs and your view on that, and then move into politics, the world, where you see this going, and solutions.
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:30.568]  Well, the media is our problem, which is why I so enjoy what you do, and podcasting in general, which is why we started Podcasting 2.0, to ensure that your podcast is on Podcasting 2.0.
[00:46:30.668 --> 00:46:35.791]  Any podcast can be there, unless you don't want it there, then it's taken off.
[00:46:36.411 --> 00:46:41.574]   And it's distributed, so they can try and come after Whatever we're doing, but it's distributed.
[00:46:41.594 --> 00:46:42.995]  There's no way to take it down.
[00:46:43.015 --> 00:46:43.315]  That's right.
[00:46:43.335 --> 00:46:44.235]  Let's just get this in there.
[00:46:44.315 --> 00:46:47.797]  You say you're not an expert, but you are really smart.
[00:46:47.897 --> 00:46:48.897]  I know you know what you're talking about.
[00:46:48.917 --> 00:46:49.798]  That's all it is research.
[00:46:50.218 --> 00:46:52.359]  You are an expert in old media.
[00:46:53.155 --> 00:46:56.956]  New media and have been in the vanguard of media for, what is it, 40 years.
[00:46:57.436 --> 00:46:59.417]  So speak to that, Adam.
[00:46:59.437 --> 00:47:03.097]  You know, you don't look that old, but you've been around a while.
[00:47:03.378 --> 00:47:04.678]  So you're an OG in this.
[00:47:04.958 --> 00:47:06.278]  You pioneered podcasting.
[00:47:07.218 --> 00:47:12.280]  Where do you see the censorship wars, the dying corporate media trying to use censorship to cut down their competition?
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:15.500]  But the more they do that, it just gives room for even more people to come forward.
[00:47:16.001 --> 00:47:25.697]   What is what's going to happen in this big struggle between dinosaur media allied with big tech against the public's Just craving for real independent ideas.
[00:47:28.435 --> 00:47:32.176]  Well, the problem is the business model.
[00:47:33.537 --> 00:47:37.918]  If you have any corporate money involved in media, it's a problem.
[00:47:38.859 --> 00:47:44.200]  So advertising is a problem because advertising is always censorship.
[00:47:45.561 --> 00:47:50.360]   At the very minimum, you can't talk about a competing product while you have a product
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:54.400]  or service who is sponsoring your program.
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:59.800]   Having been in this business for a long time with commercial television and radio, the
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:01.041]  advertiser rules.
[00:48:01.041 --> 00:48:06.920]   The advertiser, if they don't want their ads running near, around, under, over a particular
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:11.201]  type of content, they will just stop advertising.
[00:48:11.239 --> 00:48:13.560]  And that's why the media is cucked.
[00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:23.265]  I mean, the media is... I mean, the two big... You know, right now, the television advertising are saying, hey, you know, we're going to be great.
[00:48:23.305 --> 00:48:24.566]  It's going to be a great year.
[00:48:24.586 --> 00:48:25.966]  You know, screw the recession.
[00:48:26.006 --> 00:48:27.147]  Everything's going to be fine.
[00:48:27.427 --> 00:48:28.508]  Well, you look into the numbers.
[00:48:28.568 --> 00:48:31.109]  The reason why is because we have an election year.
[00:48:31.169 --> 00:48:36.492]  So they know that a billion dollars or more is going to be spent on the midterm elections and pharma.
[00:48:36.892 --> 00:48:48.715]  So, Pfizer, we've all seen the super cuts, you know, they in essence own the media, which is why there's no real pushback against anything when it comes to pharmaceuticals.
[00:48:49.635 --> 00:48:52.316]  There you go, that's a perfect chart of how it all fits together.
[00:48:53.496 --> 00:49:05.235]   So, what Dvorak and I discovered 15 years ago when we started the No Agenda podcast is it is very possible, and you know this too, To make a living.
[00:49:05.696 --> 00:49:07.617]  Now, we only do an audio podcast.
[00:49:07.637 --> 00:49:08.618]  We don't have video.
[00:49:08.959 --> 00:49:10.800]  We literally do everything ourselves.
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:14.283]  Our family members help out with some back office stuff.
[00:49:15.484 --> 00:49:16.986]  And we keep it very lean.
[00:49:17.006 --> 00:49:18.887]  I do all the audio production.
[00:49:19.248 --> 00:49:29.757]  And we have been able to sustain ourselves and our families with purely only support from the listeners, which we call producers, because we expect them to produce with their time, their talent, or their treasure.
[00:49:30.182 --> 00:49:36.302]   It'll be 15 years, the 26th of October, and it's only grown, it's only been better and
[00:49:36.302 --> 00:49:38.302]  more rewarding to do this.
[00:49:38.302 --> 00:49:39.402]  These models work.
[00:49:39.402 --> 00:49:50.381]   The minute you have anything that has finances attached to it, that's what will be gone after.
[00:49:50.382 --> 00:49:55.148]  Let's elaborate on that because I've uniquely gone through things that have shown me how the system works.
[00:49:55.188 --> 00:49:56.550]  A lot of folks haven't.
[00:49:56.811 --> 00:49:57.592]  You have as well.
[00:49:57.632 --> 00:50:00.235]  But to quantify what you were saying earlier, it's so important.
[00:50:01.189 --> 00:50:12.119]  Whether it's CNN or ABC News or any of these places, they're extincting themselves because they're owned and controlled by corporate interests that simply use them as a repeater system.
[00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:17.064]  And the public has figured that out, but they can't stop because their sponsors won't let them.
[00:50:17.504 --> 00:50:20.647]  And anybody that's had sponsors learns over time, they try to take control of your life.
[00:50:20.666 --> 00:50:25.505]  That's why we moved to direct sale of products at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:50:25.505 --> 00:50:27.306]  Our radio and TV stations still have their ads.
[00:50:27.306 --> 00:50:31.467]   That's what people hear during most of the breaks is the affiliates break.
[00:50:31.467 --> 00:50:37.545]   But absolutely, and so as this decentralization happens, they've had this big concerted effort.
[00:50:37.545 --> 00:50:41.746]   I remember a Wall Street Journal article five years ago that was a subscriber article, but
[00:50:41.746 --> 00:50:45.906]   the article that linked to it that had some excerpts was, I think, Gizmodo, and it had
[00:50:45.906 --> 00:50:51.106]   the headline, "Hold on to your tinfoil hat, Alex Jones, you're about to be taken off the
[00:50:51.886 --> 00:51:07.190]  And in that big 25-page article that it linked to out of the Wall Street Journal, they said, this was an article before News Corp split and sold off entertainment to Disney, and they kept its news division, the Wall Street Journal, Fox News, and the local stations they own, and systems.
[00:51:07.930 --> 00:51:09.870]  And they said in there, people got to read this article.
[00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:11.531]  I read an article like 10 times back at the time.
[00:51:11.551 --> 00:51:13.011]  That's why I knew I was about to be deplatformed.
[00:51:13.311 --> 00:51:16.132]  They said, we're going to censor Wikileaks.
[00:51:17.068 --> 00:51:23.250]  And when the left, when the corporate media censors it together, when the left accepts that, we'll have the left censored.
[00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:24.491]  That's how they saw it.
[00:51:24.651 --> 00:51:31.353]  And when we censor Alex Jones in the coming months, when the right wing doesn't stand up for him, we'll set the president to censor them.
[00:51:31.453 --> 00:51:37.215]  So it's Jack Sprat could eat no fat, his wife could eat no lean, between the two they lick the platter clean.
[00:51:37.555 --> 00:51:39.376]  So people asked how I knew this was coming.
[00:51:39.776 --> 00:51:45.758]  They stated it to their shareholders saying, you think corporate media is done?
[00:51:46.849 --> 00:51:52.134]  You think we're going to be supplanted by the Alex Joneses and Julian Assanges of the day?
[00:51:52.174 --> 00:51:57.399]  Now it's Joe Rogan, and of course you're bigger than ever, and the Adam Curries, and so many others.
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:14.377]   But there they were, telling their shareholders in no uncertain terms, we're working with major governments and corporations and big tech To bring in a new dark age of censorship against everybody, and when they don't stand up to the first domino with Julian Assange and Alex Jones, all the dominoes will go down.
[00:52:14.437 --> 00:52:16.540]  But yes, there's been massive censorship.
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:18.182]  Yes, they even censor a former president.
[00:52:18.642 --> 00:52:21.225]  But it's backfiring even more now, in my view.
[00:52:21.485 --> 00:52:26.091]  Can you give us your take on my analysis, if you think it's accurate, and how you see this fight unfolding?
[00:52:27.541 --> 00:52:35.367]  It is accurate, but what's interesting is everyone, most people I think are looking at media the wrong way now.
[00:52:36.628 --> 00:52:59.874]   Once the guardrails, the gatekeepers were removed, so what I mean by that is, and this was part of I don't want to call it a vision, but when I approached Dave Weiner to implement some technical changes in RSS for podcasting, it was all part of solving a way to use the internet to broadcast.
[00:52:59.994 --> 00:53:02.536]  And the whole point was, we don't need transmitters.
[00:53:02.876 --> 00:53:03.676]  By the way, take your time.
[00:53:03.716 --> 00:53:10.380]  Stop, stop, because you are credited as being the founder of the podcast idea, not just your new show in the last 15 years.
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:12.781]  Yeah, new, but relatively new.
[00:53:12.801 --> 00:53:25.147]  But going back, take your time here, because you are an expert on this, explaining this handing over of power or keys to the public and this giant revolution that changed the whole world.
[00:53:25.667 --> 00:53:27.548]  This is one hell of an achievement.
[00:53:27.588 --> 00:53:33.877]   I mean, this is like Literally, the Wright Brothers and Kitty Hawk or Henry Ford and his assembly line.
[00:53:34.097 --> 00:53:35.119]  And I'm not blowing smoke.
[00:53:35.419 --> 00:53:36.161]  This is real, Adam.
[00:53:36.181 --> 00:53:36.882]  This is a big deal.
[00:53:36.922 --> 00:53:38.204]  So, take your time on this.
[00:53:40.109 --> 00:54:05.479]  It's fun to see that the core of podcasting is this one little thing called RSS, which is, you can make it in a notepad, you can write one yourself, you know, you typically have a hosting company, but it's just an XML is what it is, it's a part of, you know, it's a computer-readable instruction text file, which you can, computers can read it, but as a human you can read it as well.
[00:54:06.579 --> 00:54:16.706]  And because it's exactly that simple, anybody with one of these files and an mp3 recorder and a web server can create a podcast.
[00:54:16.726 --> 00:54:21.869]  So how did you visionaries see that decentralization and then help get the code change and launch it?
[00:54:21.889 --> 00:54:22.750]  Because this is a big deal.
[00:54:24.649 --> 00:54:28.210]  Honestly, I didn't see the decentralization in that manner at the time.
[00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:30.470]  What I saw, I just wanted to do a radio show.
[00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:32.831]  I was like, you know, it's a pain.
[00:54:33.351 --> 00:54:41.933]  People have no idea what it's really like to be in mainstream because you really are very, there's line producers and people, you know, you can't say this, you can't say that.
[00:54:41.973 --> 00:54:44.573]  There's people in your ear talking on the radio.
[00:54:44.613 --> 00:54:48.074]  And, you know, we have this famously, oh, goodness, the hotline is going.
[00:54:48.134 --> 00:54:50.254]  That's the PD, the program director.
[00:54:50.294 --> 00:54:50.855]  I screwed up.
[00:54:50.895 --> 00:54:51.795]  I said something wrong.
[00:54:51.815 --> 00:54:52.795]  You know, whatever it is.
[00:54:54.206 --> 00:54:56.988]  You just build up these filters and it becomes very debilitating.
[00:54:57.668 --> 00:55:02.952]  And these are the filters that got put in in the 20s once radio became popularized and then TV.
[00:55:03.012 --> 00:55:06.194]  So that's why this is such a seminal moment for listeners and viewers right now.
[00:55:06.735 --> 00:55:12.639]  Adam Curry, one of the former top talk shows in the world, doesn't want people telling him what to do.
[00:55:13.139 --> 00:55:15.661]  He's looking at computers and he says, we'll do it this way.
[00:55:16.442 --> 00:55:16.862]  Continue.
[00:55:19.295 --> 00:55:35.434]  So that part was actually, we created that in 2000 and that worked, but there was, you know, we were missing an element and it wasn't until I saw the first iPod in 2003 where I went, oh, hold on a second, this is not just a jukebox, this is a radio receiver.
[00:55:35.834 --> 00:55:36.794]  That's what I've been missing.
[00:55:37.335 --> 00:55:39.175]  And so we automated that process.
[00:55:39.215 --> 00:55:44.797]  So the first podcast app was in fact the iPod, the first one that was popularized.
[00:55:44.857 --> 00:55:53.000]  And God bless Steve Jobs for putting that into iTunes and into eventually now the podcast app.
[00:55:53.780 --> 00:56:06.800]   But it was actually much later, Alex, when I think it was March, around March of 2020, and Apple had been a great steward of podcasting, but it had kind of become the default on-ramp.
[00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:12.202]  You had to go through Apple to really be in podcasting, which was irksome.
[00:56:12.842 --> 00:56:20.764]  It's not necessary, but if you really wanted exposure, and then I think it was in coordination with maybe Twitter and Facebook and Instagram.
[00:56:21.284 --> 00:56:31.351]  Apple took a number of shows off including yours and you know like x22 report I mean, oh man, these things are so dangerous and it wasn't it just bugged me.
[00:56:31.371 --> 00:56:41.127]   It was like, you know This is a decentralized open system, so everybody can stay with Apple, and if you want to see shows go away, they can go away.
[00:56:41.547 --> 00:56:50.933]  If you don't, then you can use any one of these 58 independent applications, which have access to the largest, cleanest, most sanitized, i.e.
[00:56:50.992 --> 00:56:58.331]   crap in there, this real podcast, over 4 million which all of these apps are connected to.
[00:56:58.331 --> 00:57:00.511]  And now along with that came another issue.
[00:57:00.511 --> 00:57:02.411]  It's like, okay, so we have that.
[00:57:02.411 --> 00:57:07.112]   You can use newpodcastapps.com, by the way, is where you can see all these different apps.
[00:57:07.112 --> 00:57:08.753]  And some of them you've probably heard of.
[00:57:08.753 --> 00:57:10.511]  They're integrating it quickly.
[00:57:10.511 --> 00:57:16.753]   We needed a way to secure value transfer so that people can get paid again.
[00:57:16.772 --> 00:57:17.392]  Slow down a little.
[00:57:17.452 --> 00:57:26.980]  So you launched the first podcasting system and now you're behind what is the 2.0 podcast revolution getting rid of the great purges we've seen.
[00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:29.261]  So elaborate in layman's terms, Adam Curry.
[00:57:32.684 --> 00:57:45.453]   So most podcast apps The big ones, Spotify and Apple, let's put it that way, use their own database and you have to submit your podcast to be in their database.
[00:57:45.913 --> 00:57:49.194]  But you don't really need to do that to be a podcast.
[00:57:49.314 --> 00:57:54.216]  Anybody can subscribe or follow your podcast in most podcast apps, but you can't find it.
[00:57:54.296 --> 00:57:55.536]  It's not searchable that way.
[00:57:56.896 --> 00:58:05.099]  So when they pull things out, that becomes unavailable for pretty much everybody overnight, just because they have control over the index, over the database.
[00:58:05.831 --> 00:58:13.735]  So, Dave Jones and I, we created podcastindex.org, which is open, free.
[00:58:13.915 --> 00:58:34.007]   We have a full-on set of programming interfaces, so app developers can create apps, and there's many, many really good ones that have been created, and we have all these new features to draw people closer while you're seeing Spotify and Apple trying to do exactly the opposite.
[00:58:34.047 --> 00:58:35.588]  They want to close their walls.
[00:58:36.229 --> 00:58:41.394]  They want to lock everybody out unless you use the Spotify system or you use the Apple subscriptions.
[00:58:42.575 --> 00:58:43.756]  And so that's fine.
[00:58:44.577 --> 00:58:53.385]  But we still need a place where we can have, you know, the next Adam Curry, Joe Rogan, Alex Jones, where they can have an actual way to communicate.
[00:58:53.445 --> 00:58:59.230]   So in a way, we're literally protecting Free speech in that regard.
[00:58:59.250 --> 00:59:08.916]  And coming back to my original point, we need to move away from the idea you have to be number one on the chart.
[00:59:08.956 --> 00:59:11.237]  You have to have the biggest, you have to have the largest.
[00:59:11.317 --> 00:59:14.919]  That is the fiat mentality.
[00:59:15.199 --> 00:59:21.943]  That's thinking about advertising and CPMs, how much money you'll get per thousand listeners or downloads.
[00:59:22.384 --> 00:59:32.322]   That's completely unimportant when we have Today, we have frictionless value transfer with many different systems, Venmo, PayPal, Cash App.
[00:59:32.562 --> 00:59:36.866]  You can send money to support people in any type of venture.
[00:59:36.886 --> 00:59:45.534]  That's the revolution is taking it away from the sponsors and big tech is individuals sponsoring the information and news that they think is most important to get out.
[00:59:46.895 --> 00:59:54.072]  Looking at this, I think the globalists are losing their battle to control decentralization, and that's why they're so panicked.
[00:59:54.092 --> 00:59:54.954]  Do you think that's accurate?
[00:59:56.694 --> 01:00:01.376]  I think, yes, the elite messaging system is broken, of course.
[01:00:01.856 --> 01:00:08.918]  And I would say Trump broke that with Twitter, which is why they had to break Twitter, which is exactly what Elon Musk, in my opinion, was sent to do.
[01:00:09.318 --> 01:00:10.139]  Go destroy it.
[01:00:10.319 --> 01:00:11.619]  I think that's pretty successful.
[01:00:11.659 --> 01:00:17.901]  He's now destroying the advertising myth around these business models.
[01:00:18.202 --> 01:00:20.982]  And I think Facebook is about to go as well.
[01:00:21.022 --> 01:00:22.263]  People are leaving in droves.
[01:00:23.604 --> 01:00:25.705]  Oh, that's one of the questions I had for you.
[01:00:25.745 --> 01:00:27.706]  That was even in the Associated Press yesterday.
[01:00:28.606 --> 01:00:29.487]  Record loss.
[01:00:29.567 --> 01:00:31.008]  Facebook is collapsing.
[01:00:31.288 --> 01:00:32.589]  So their own censorship.
[01:00:32.669 --> 01:00:37.731]  Google is in deep trouble because they broke their algorithm, what, five years ago, to start controlling things.
[01:00:37.792 --> 01:00:40.433]  It used to actually be the knowledge of the crowd.
[01:00:40.453 --> 01:00:41.634]  What we searched went to the top.
[01:00:41.934 --> 01:00:43.275]  They now completely rigged that.
[01:00:43.495 --> 01:00:45.636]  So they're really committing suicide, aren't they?
[01:00:48.944 --> 01:00:52.285]  Yeah, excuse me, it's a form of harakiri when you look at it.
[01:00:52.305 --> 01:01:01.788]  I think Zuckerberg, I mean, so his solution, clearly what he sees, and this fits into your transhumanist future, that's the metaverse.
[01:01:02.088 --> 01:01:05.170]  So that is, you know, that's what Web 3 is all about.
[01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:14.849]   And it's funny, I was reading the signal or text messages that Elon Musk had to, in discovery,
[01:01:14.849 --> 01:01:19.369]   you know, the counterparty will say, hey, we wanna have every single text message
[01:01:19.369 --> 01:01:24.128]   you ever sent that had the word Twitter in it or related to this deal.
[01:01:24.128 --> 01:01:25.849]  And so that all came out.
[01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:29.730]  And you just look at the cluelessness, the cluelessness.
[01:01:29.730 --> 01:01:31.809]  No one has an idea of what to do.
[01:01:31.809 --> 01:01:33.989]  And the business is crap.
[01:01:33.989 --> 01:01:34.869]  It really is.
[01:01:34.869 --> 01:01:41.009]   I mean, it's, and now the bad thing is that's all being shuttled to TikTok.
[01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:43.181]  That's where the attention is going.
[01:01:43.761 --> 01:01:48.944]  That's the main reason, besides Apple shutting down some tracking capability for Facebook.
[01:01:49.864 --> 01:01:52.385]  TikTok is eating their lunch because they just have a format.
[01:01:52.765 --> 01:01:57.748]  People are so saturated with news that they just want to look at these dumb videos.
[01:01:57.808 --> 01:02:02.430]  Adam, I want you to elaborate on that in the few minutes we have left, but what you just said is so important here.
[01:02:03.234 --> 01:02:10.363]  Every time, and I've seen this myself when the globalists have tried to hire me, I'm sure you've had powerful people approach you, they don't know what to do.
[01:02:10.443 --> 01:02:16.322]   So they project this aura of invincibility, this order of incredible power like the great
[01:02:16.322 --> 01:02:20.003]   all-powerful Oz, but it's really a little man behind the curtain and all it takes is
[01:02:20.003 --> 01:02:23.243]  Toto to pull the curtain back.
[01:02:23.243 --> 01:02:27.563]   But that makes it more scary that this very group is blowing up pipelines and starting
[01:02:27.563 --> 01:02:32.002]   wars and dissolving borders and trying to wage war against the general public as if
[01:02:32.002 --> 01:02:34.802]  they drive us into submission.
[01:02:34.802 --> 01:02:36.923]  It'll make it easier to dominate us.
[01:02:36.923 --> 01:02:40.947]  But actually, it was the status quo that was making us go to sleep and dominate us.
[01:02:41.368 --> 01:02:48.094]  By upsetting the whole world, they thought, as Klaus Schwab said, this angrier world would bring in their Build Back Better Great Reset.
[01:02:48.355 --> 01:02:50.377]  But instead, it is enraging people.
[01:02:50.397 --> 01:02:57.623]   And whether you're in Brazil, Or Italy, or Canada, or anywhere they're electing anti-globalist candidates and I really think they've screwed the pooch.
[01:02:58.023 --> 01:02:59.324]  I really think it's blown up in their face.
[01:02:59.384 --> 01:03:03.988]  I don't think we've beaten them yet, but I think it's safe to say they have really screwed up.
[01:03:04.248 --> 01:03:06.290]  But that's even scarier because they've got nuclear weapons.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:10.583]  Yeah, I'm not too worried about the nuclear weapon thing.
[01:03:10.623 --> 01:03:12.886]  I mean, to me, that's just hyperbole.
[01:03:12.926 --> 01:03:14.148]  They just throw that in.
[01:03:14.228 --> 01:03:16.470]  The whole idea is to scare everybody into submission.
[01:03:16.851 --> 01:03:18.493]  That's the push.
[01:03:18.533 --> 01:03:19.394]  That's the idea.
[01:03:20.676 --> 01:03:30.612]   What's so beautiful is that I would say a good 30% of the world is switched You don't want something as a rule, and I'm not perfect, I'm bad about eating bad food.
[01:03:30.872 --> 01:03:32.452]  You don't want something in a box.
[01:03:32.673 --> 01:03:36.112]   I know you walk through the supermarket aisle and it's cartoon land, man.
[01:03:36.112 --> 01:03:40.592]   It's beautiful, all these colors, and it's going to taste, you can already taste just
[01:03:40.592 --> 01:03:42.073]  what's on the packaging.
[01:03:42.073 --> 01:03:46.173]  You don't have to, you can source your food somewhere else.
[01:03:46.173 --> 01:03:49.773]   You don't want something as a rule, and I'm not perfect, I'm bad about eating bad food.
[01:03:49.773 --> 01:03:51.032]  You don't want something in a box.
[01:03:51.032 --> 01:03:56.512]   If you can pick it off a tree or buy it from a farmer, that's what you want.
[01:03:56.512 --> 01:04:00.113]  It sounds like, "Oh, well, of course."
[01:04:01.061 --> 01:04:03.543]  You just have to go, you have to look around your local community.
[01:04:03.563 --> 01:04:08.446]  And the more you look for a farmer's market, the more people go, the way the free market works, the bigger the market gets.
[01:04:09.787 --> 01:04:10.668]  And it's, yes.
[01:04:11.428 --> 01:04:15.191]  And so that's why, and I haven't really brought it in yet, but that's why.
[01:04:15.211 --> 01:04:19.274]  So there's two things that I think bring us to, well, let me step back.
[01:04:19.674 --> 01:04:28.215]   So along with that, People are learning that technology and the Internet is not Silicon Valley.
[01:04:28.275 --> 01:04:30.556]  We don't have to be on Facebook.
[01:04:30.576 --> 01:04:32.358]  We don't have to have to use Twitter.
[01:04:32.698 --> 01:04:34.859]  Instagram is not the be-all the end-all.
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:41.044]  If you want to communicate, there's many decentralized protocols that people are using, experimenting with.
[01:04:41.444 --> 01:04:56.438]   And back to my point, These little groups, you know, kind of like tribes, they intersect and there's ways that technically that happens on the Internet with Mastodon as a good example or other matrix or even going back to Internet Relay, chat, IRC.
[01:04:56.819 --> 01:04:58.039]  These things are in play.
[01:04:58.119 --> 01:04:59.419]  People are finding them.
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:06.082]  It's natural when the Silicon Valley companies, people are onto them.
[01:05:06.102 --> 01:05:10.481]   They understand They realize that they're being manipulated.
[01:05:10.481 --> 01:05:13.841]   They are starting to either completely check out or seek alternatives.
[01:05:13.841 --> 01:05:19.122]   And that is where the beauty is and where I think the United States is actually uniquely qualified
[01:05:19.122 --> 01:05:23.122]  because we do have these, we do have this pioneering spirit.
[01:05:23.186 --> 01:05:33.252]  We're not afraid to, in fact, you know, part of the preamble, you know, part of the declaration is from time to time we should, you know, have the right to change our government.
[01:05:33.312 --> 01:05:37.194]  Well, you can't just change the government overnight, but let's change our behavior.
[01:05:37.234 --> 01:05:38.275]  We have that under control 100%.
[01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:52.608]   Give your kid a laptop and say, hey kid, Load Linux on this, and then we'll talk about what we can do, and learn how to use some of these alternatives, which are actually not that hard to do.
[01:05:52.628 --> 01:06:08.300]   Well, Adam, what's crazy about this in closing, and I really appreciate your time, but I think you've got to go, is that you didn't know you were revolutionizing the world 22 years ago when you launched podcasting with just a few ideas, or the 2.0, you probably knew what you were doing then.
[01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:14.643]  Who knows what discoveries have already been made that are just now in their embryonic phase that will challenge the system even more.
[01:06:14.663 --> 01:06:18.804]  And I think that's the moral of the story is the globalists, the big corporations are not all powerful.
[01:06:19.124 --> 01:06:20.725]  They're the tail wagging the dog.
[01:06:21.545 --> 01:06:28.528]  So as negative as things are on the surface, that's really the death throes or the death howl of this system.
[01:06:28.869 --> 01:06:35.872]  So as long as we're independent and innovate and really don't even care what the corporate media says about us, we're going to win.
[01:06:36.152 --> 01:06:37.533]  So final comments on that?
[01:06:37.613 --> 01:06:38.473]  Any other solutions?
[01:06:38.553 --> 01:06:39.834]  And I'm going to go out on a limb here.
[01:06:40.802 --> 01:06:42.663]  You've already been at the top of international TV.
[01:06:43.183 --> 01:06:45.825]  You had the biggest show ever when MTV was the biggest thing in the world.
[01:06:45.845 --> 01:06:48.286]  And you've been successful ever since then.
[01:06:48.706 --> 01:06:50.928]  I know I've been approached by big corporations to sell out.
[01:06:51.408 --> 01:06:57.952]  Going out on a limb here, I don't think I am, I bet you've been approached to go work for the system again and be their tool.
[01:06:58.332 --> 01:06:59.092]  A, is that true?
[01:06:59.232 --> 01:07:02.494]  And B, why did you say no to them when you were probably offered 20 times the money?
[01:07:06.309 --> 01:07:07.549]  I've seen this happen.
[01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:10.350]  It's subtle.
[01:07:10.930 --> 01:07:18.052]  To be honest, I don't really think I've been approached ever with really, really big money.
[01:07:18.072 --> 01:07:22.154]  I was a problem child at MTV from day one.
[01:07:22.554 --> 01:07:26.895]  I think they kind of know, Curry, he doesn't fall for that.
[01:07:27.475 --> 01:07:33.457]  It was more in the Netherlands because I started my career there and it was a big show all over Europe.
[01:07:34.097 --> 01:07:59.813]   Very quickly I was invited to political things and parties where politicians were around and rich people and I just thought it was super super creepy and and I never I'm not really interested I just wanted to be a DJ or or you know just wanted to be an interviewer I wasn't really interested in that so I Maybe that's subliminal somehow, that just from early on, but that's never really done much for me.
[01:08:01.654 --> 01:08:04.074]  That world is getting smaller and smaller, you know.
[01:08:04.134 --> 01:08:09.375]  It's like the amount of people who are on the award shows, and that's actually a good example.
[01:08:10.115 --> 01:08:13.916]  No one cares anymore about the award shows because they're tired of celebrities.
[01:08:13.976 --> 01:08:14.956]  That's a great example.
[01:08:15.016 --> 01:08:16.356]  Not just Big Tech is dying.
[01:08:16.656 --> 01:08:17.716]  Hollywood's collapsed.
[01:08:18.116 --> 01:08:21.697]  The award shows have, what, 10% of the viewers they had 30 years ago.
[01:08:22.426 --> 01:08:22.867]  You're right.
[01:08:23.127 --> 01:08:27.733]  All these old mummies and Henry Kissinger at galas and people hanging out with Bono.
[01:08:27.853 --> 01:08:28.534]  It's a joke.
[01:08:28.955 --> 01:08:30.196]  Everyone is rejecting it.
[01:08:30.437 --> 01:08:33.461]  But it's like they just keep pretending that we want Brian Stelter.
[01:08:34.222 --> 01:08:35.924]  Where do you... How do you see this ending?
[01:08:38.492 --> 01:08:40.675]  Well, nothing's going to end for a long while.
[01:08:41.256 --> 01:08:53.692]  Again, I'm not quite sure when we're going back to the central bank digital currency, but the things now are learn about what you're eating because we need to be strong and you need to be not afraid.
[01:08:53.712 --> 01:08:57.556]   I mean, more and more people are starting to And I love this about America.
[01:08:57.916 --> 01:09:02.639]  People are saying, hey, you know, I'm just, I have to put my stake in the ground and say, no, this is not okay.
[01:09:02.679 --> 01:09:04.841]  And I don't agree with this and I don't need a fight.
[01:09:04.981 --> 01:09:22.292]  And we just need to be wary that when you're, when you don't have good protein running around your brain and people are sending messages 24 seven through all different vehicles to rile you up, to get you, it's like my, my, my boy Paul out here who does the septic.
[01:09:22.944 --> 01:09:33.390]  You know, he came back from a Ted Nugent concert out here in Fredericksburg and he was riled up and he's like, you know, this is a mess and we got, I'm like, Joe, bro, just let's just chill down out for a second.
[01:09:33.830 --> 01:09:34.710]  It's going to be okay.
[01:09:35.010 --> 01:09:36.331]  We got to take care of each other.
[01:09:36.351 --> 01:09:41.694]  There's really not that much to worry, but they're not coming in with the stormtroopers overnight.
[01:09:41.774 --> 01:09:42.815]  That's not going to happen.
[01:09:42.855 --> 01:09:46.797]  But to break the system, the easiest way is to not participate in it.
[01:09:46.897 --> 01:09:58.260]   And we have Really, the only two things that I see, we have RSS, which is, you know, we're expanding that, so video will work well with this, along with basically anything you want to do.
[01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:02.422]  The index, I think, will be more than just podcasts, because the system is good.
[01:10:02.843 --> 01:10:11.447]  And that goes along with the Lightning Network, which is, you can view as Venmo for Bitcoin, which means that it is censorship resistant.
[01:10:11.587 --> 01:10:15.469]  Pretty much, you cannot interrupt a payment from a listener directly.
[01:10:15.589 --> 01:10:19.611]  That was my next question, and finish on that, because I know you've got to go, and I've got to go to our next guest, David Icke, joining us.
[01:10:19.631 --> 01:10:20.331]  This has been amazing.
[01:10:21.291 --> 01:10:21.671]  Oh, cool.
[01:10:21.931 --> 01:10:26.373]  You were talking about this on Glenn Beck, so I'm glad you raised it.
[01:10:26.893 --> 01:10:39.498]  So just like podcasts decentralizes media, something like Bitcoin is decentralized from Ethereum and things that are going in line with working with the globalists, where they can surveil you, they can control what you do.
[01:10:39.898 --> 01:10:41.719]  So the answer is continue with the revolution.
[01:10:42.708 --> 01:10:47.157]  Of us using and accepting things like Bitcoin outside of these other control coins.
[01:10:47.197 --> 01:10:48.099]  Spend a few minutes on that.
[01:10:49.767 --> 01:10:55.388]  Yeah, the main thing to look at is that Bitcoin is now in its 13th year.
[01:10:56.488 --> 01:10:58.589]  It has no CEO.
[01:10:58.629 --> 01:10:59.929]  There's no organization.
[01:11:00.149 --> 01:11:06.191]  It runs purely based on the protocol, which is open and anyone can see it and anyone can see what it's doing.
[01:11:06.671 --> 01:11:09.331]  And the individuals who run nodes, and there's more than 40,000.
[01:11:09.611 --> 01:11:11.332]  I run a couple of them.
[01:11:11.372 --> 01:11:12.292]  Lots of people run them.
[01:11:12.352 --> 01:11:13.532]  We should be running millions.
[01:11:14.432 --> 01:11:16.893]  So there's pure, you can have sovereignty over your money.
[01:11:17.573 --> 01:11:29.160]  And so just to state clearly, anything that has a CEO and now even the SEC is saying, you know, Bitcoin is a commodity, like gold is a commodity.
[01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:31.141]  So you can use that for commerce.
[01:11:31.181 --> 01:11:33.943]  You can use it to save it or whatever you want.
[01:11:33.963 --> 01:11:36.304]  You can use it to put it in your gold teeth.
[01:11:37.024 --> 01:11:40.267]  Everything else is a security, which means it's like buying a share.
[01:11:40.367 --> 01:11:45.071]  So Ethereum is now being classified as a company with stock.
[01:11:45.091 --> 01:11:46.432]  So that's not really what you want.
[01:11:46.472 --> 01:11:47.913]  You want something that the people use.
[01:11:48.493 --> 01:12:02.702]   And even, yes, the price is volatile, it's all over the place, but there are now Apps, and the one I'll mention who just got a huge investment to market it from Bitcoiners, not from Silicon Valley guys, is Strike.
[01:12:02.822 --> 01:12:04.824]  Strike.me, I think, is the URL.
[01:12:05.304 --> 01:12:07.666]  And that is true, it's just like Venmo.
[01:12:07.686 --> 01:12:21.217]  You set it up the same way, you load it the same way, except then you can pay peer-to-peer, you can hook it up to send money to podcasts, and that is extremely, I mean, it's very private.
[01:12:22.597 --> 01:12:26.838]  Nothing is 100% anonymous in that regard, but it can't be stopped.
[01:12:27.158 --> 01:12:29.039]  No one can interrupt that transaction.
[01:12:29.099 --> 01:12:31.379]  So this really is the future revolution.
[01:12:31.919 --> 01:12:38.081]  As long as we keep innovating with our own decisions, decide to do decentralized things, we're going to build a better world and be in a better position.
[01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:41.782]  A lot of my listeners already follow your show, but how do people find everything Adam Curry?
[01:12:43.783 --> 01:12:49.375]  Well, the easiest way is curry.com, but for the show, noagendashow.com.
[01:12:49.615 --> 01:12:59.321]   And I just wanted to say, Alex, as we talk about this, and I think I've mentioned that to you before, I've always been, jealous is not the word, but I've always been in awe of InfoWars.
[01:12:59.501 --> 01:13:00.922]  InfoWars.com.
[01:13:00.982 --> 01:13:02.242]  That is the best name.
[01:13:02.322 --> 01:13:03.542]  It is the best URL.
[01:13:03.882 --> 01:13:05.963]  Ultimately, that is what's happening.
[01:13:06.243 --> 01:13:11.805]  It is an information war on our brains and fighting back.
[01:13:12.145 --> 01:13:17.246]  The only thing we can do is educate ourselves and use parallel systems.
[01:13:17.586 --> 01:13:18.786]  We're not going to fix this.
[01:13:19.206 --> 01:13:20.207]  This is what's happening now.
[01:13:21.007 --> 01:13:24.288]  My personal view is let's build some systems that are parallel.
[01:13:24.348 --> 01:13:26.948]  We already have this with food, with communications.
[01:13:27.008 --> 01:13:28.369]  People are doing it with health care.
[01:13:28.389 --> 01:13:30.749]  People are doing it with homeschooling.
[01:13:31.589 --> 01:13:36.970]  And then let's get our local city councils, etc., our school boards back on track.
[01:13:37.271 --> 01:13:39.651]  The rest will just have to do what it does.
[01:13:40.071 --> 01:13:43.432]  As long as we have these alternatives, we're going to be okay.
[01:13:44.597 --> 01:13:49.578]  And to quote The Who, and I guess Roger Daltrey, I don't need to fight to prove I'm right.
[01:13:50.198 --> 01:13:53.439]  We just have to be out here in the fields and build the new world we want.
[01:13:53.859 --> 01:13:55.420]  Adam Curry, incredible interview.
[01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:57.000]  Thank you so much for the time.
[01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:58.381]  Look forward to talking to you again soon, sir.
[01:13:59.381 --> 01:14:00.061]  My pleasure, brother.
[01:14:00.081 --> 01:14:00.641]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:14:00.721 --> 01:14:01.121]  Thank you.
[01:14:01.441 --> 01:14:03.142]  We'll be right back with David Icke.
[01:14:03.162 --> 01:14:03.602]  Stay with us.
[01:14:06.741 --> 01:14:07.621]  Look around you.
[01:14:08.321 --> 01:14:12.683]  Everything I predicted from the Globalist's own documents, from their own admissions, is now happening.
[01:14:13.323 --> 01:14:16.524]  Infowars credibility, my credibility has never been higher.
[01:14:17.224 --> 01:14:26.007]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I can steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits, stay on air.
[01:14:26.547 --> 01:14:31.549]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[01:14:32.209 --> 01:14:35.830]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[01:14:36.670 --> 01:14:39.331]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations.
[01:14:39.771 --> 01:14:45.714]  But I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[01:14:46.054 --> 01:14:46.894]  It's unsustainable.
[01:14:47.334 --> 01:14:48.555]  So please, visit.
[01:14:49.651 --> 01:14:51.212]  SaveInfoWars.com.
[01:14:51.632 --> 01:14:59.497]  SaveInfoWars.com, where you can make straight donations, $5, $10, $50, $100, whatever you can, so that I can continue to persevere.
[01:14:59.757 --> 01:15:02.418]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[01:15:02.758 --> 01:15:03.719]  Thank you for your support.
[01:15:04.059 --> 01:15:04.900]  Wouldn't be here without you.
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:06.320]  SaveInfoWars.com.
[01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:12.384]  The InfoWars store super sale, the biggest sale of the year, is now live.
[01:15:13.104 --> 01:15:32.874]  All of our best-selling items, from the Ultimate Krill Oil, to the Vitamin D3 Gummies with Calcium, to Supermelon Vitality, to our great Fizzy Magnesium, highest quality magnesium out there, to RainForce Ultra, you name it, is all back in stock, 40 to 50% off at InfoWorkshore.com.
[01:15:32.894 --> 01:15:38.777]  And the most exciting part of this is, we have X3 back in stock.
[01:15:39.844 --> 01:15:47.966]  So many people, the UN estimates over 2 billion, have cognitive disabilities because they have iodine deficiencies.
[01:15:48.626 --> 01:15:51.386]  And most forms of iodine are not fully absorbable.
[01:15:52.006 --> 01:15:56.447]  But we have all three of the best, healthiest, most absorbable types of iodine together.
[01:15:56.467 --> 01:15:59.068]  That's why it's X3 in one formula.
[01:15:59.668 --> 01:16:00.728]  Now we also have X2.
[01:16:00.888 --> 01:16:01.588]  It's apples and oranges.
[01:16:01.668 --> 01:16:02.569]  It's a great formula as well.
[01:16:02.829 --> 01:16:04.249]  But it's pure deep-earth crystal.
[01:16:04.909 --> 01:16:05.909]  and is amazing.
[01:16:05.909 --> 01:16:12.269]   X3 is deep-earth crystal with two other healthy types of iodine that your body absorbs.
[01:16:12.269 --> 01:16:16.869]   It is essential to electrochemical activity of the body, all cellular activity, your immune
[01:16:16.869 --> 01:16:20.709]  system, your stamina, your libido, your fertility.
[01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:24.349]   So many of the problems we have in the world today are because of iodine deficiency.
[01:16:24.646 --> 01:16:30.109]  Hell, until 30 years ago, the government put it in the salt, a low-quality version, but it still had some great effects.
[01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:31.850]  Many experts are IQs.
[01:16:32.190 --> 01:16:38.194]  After just a few years of iodine in the salt, we're boosted up to 15 points on average 10 points.
[01:16:38.734 --> 01:16:42.235]   So X3 is unlike any other product out there.
[01:16:42.235 --> 01:16:48.395]   It's triiodine, and it's available at mfulwarstore.com, sold out for about six months
[01:16:48.395 --> 01:16:50.075]  at 50% off.
[01:16:50.075 --> 01:16:56.315]   So, restock your X3, or if you've never tried X3, try X3 today, and know regardless you win,
[01:16:56.315 --> 01:17:01.314]   because you're funding an organization that is having a massive effect against the New World Order,
[01:17:01.314 --> 01:17:03.274]  promoting liberty and freedom and justice.
[01:17:03.274 --> 01:17:06.755]  So X3, back in stock at mfulwarstore.com.
[01:17:06.755 --> 01:17:08.794]  Why don't we talk about cryptocurrency?
[01:17:09.835 --> 01:17:10.675]  Okay.
[01:17:10.675 --> 01:17:18.794]   Because one of the ways that you encourage your audience to give you money is in cryptocurrency donations, right?
[01:17:18.778 --> 01:17:19.058]  Yes.
[01:17:19.699 --> 01:17:23.121]  And you have a page on your website that's just for cryptocurrency donations, right?
[01:17:23.482 --> 01:17:25.303]  InfoWars.com forward slash crypto.
[01:17:25.383 --> 01:17:28.045]  Is that a little advertisement just there?
[01:17:28.185 --> 01:17:29.226]  Well, we're fighting the deep state.
[01:17:29.246 --> 01:17:29.746]  We need money.
[01:17:29.766 --> 01:17:30.207]  All right.
[01:17:31.127 --> 01:17:31.768]  This is it.
[01:17:32.428 --> 01:17:33.329]  Give crypto.
[01:17:33.429 --> 01:17:34.550]  Fun InfoWars.
[01:17:35.365 --> 01:17:38.548]  Sponsor us with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, right?
[01:17:39.068 --> 01:17:41.630]  That will end up as a clip on your show tonight.
[01:17:41.650 --> 01:17:43.652]  Your advertisers bring a cryptocurrency page.
[01:17:44.993 --> 01:17:49.437]  You know, I mean, I mean, people want to keep us in the fight.
[01:17:49.517 --> 01:17:52.740]  So I mean, I hope whoever the big whales are, they'll give us money before we keep doing it.
[01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:54.241]  We'll just keep, we'll just keep.
[01:17:54.562 --> 01:17:56.243]  We need to see money, guys.
[01:17:56.283 --> 01:17:57.024]  You're in this forum.
[01:17:57.164 --> 01:18:00.647]  Let's move on.
[01:18:00.487 --> 01:18:02.487]  People care about the First Amendment.
[01:18:02.487 --> 01:18:11.487]  [music]
[01:18:11.487 --> 01:18:16.487]   Wow, the air raid sirens sound a lot like those beautiful whale songs.
[01:18:16.490 --> 01:18:19.091]  Thank you for joining us on this Saturday Emergency Transmission.
[01:18:20.751 --> 01:18:23.512]  David Icke, ladies and gentlemen, is coming up.
[01:18:24.692 --> 01:18:27.172]  And again, a lot of times I do Saturday and other shows live.
[01:18:27.852 --> 01:18:30.053]  This was a tape show, so I've already interviewed David.
[01:18:30.893 --> 01:18:31.653]  It's the best ever.
[01:18:32.874 --> 01:18:33.894]  But wait, that's not hype.
[01:18:34.034 --> 01:18:34.814]  Wait till you see it.
[01:18:35.334 --> 01:18:36.054]  Wait till you hear it.
[01:18:36.194 --> 01:18:39.495]  Two hours, commercial free, coming up right now.
[01:18:40.822 --> 01:18:42.684]  And that Adam Curry interview, incredible as well.
[01:18:43.205 --> 01:18:44.125]  What a trailblazer.
[01:18:44.266 --> 01:18:50.612]  I mean, you just think about the innovations he did that changed our world, that we would be in so much trouble if it wasn't for him.
[01:18:50.692 --> 01:18:54.236]  Think about how inventing podcasting changed and decentralized power.
[01:18:54.636 --> 01:18:55.237]  So amazing.
[01:18:55.257 --> 01:19:01.953]   We're going to go to the David Icke interview here in just a moment, but remember, The enemy cannot stand the fact that we're on air.
[01:19:01.993 --> 01:19:10.840]  They are so angry about independent people supporting independent ideas and how you have commissioned us in this fight against the New World Order.
[01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:14.463]  So I thank you and I beg you, keep me in the fight.
[01:19:14.844 --> 01:19:17.766]  Keep this amazing crew that's been through hell in the fight.
[01:19:18.927 --> 01:19:21.569]  Please support us at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:20:41.001 --> 01:20:44.201]  We gotta work with outside partners.
[01:20:43.739 --> 01:20:48.841]  We've got to work with folks that are decentralized because they're trying to shut down our main shopping cart, trying to shut down InfoWars.
[01:20:48.881 --> 01:20:51.942]  So this is part of that diversification, working with partners.
[01:20:52.282 --> 01:20:52.922]  50%off.com.
[01:20:53.162 --> 01:20:53.882]  They are great people.
[01:20:54.603 --> 01:21:02.426]  If you want to go to InfoWarsTore.com, we have exclusively the Great Reset and the War for the World unsigned books for the regular price.
[01:21:02.486 --> 01:21:08.035]   If you want to do a fundraiser and buy the signed copy, They're available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:21:08.055 --> 01:21:10.117]  I want to thank those of you that got signed copies.
[01:21:10.137 --> 01:21:19.443]  I want to encourage those of you that haven't to get your signed copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World at InfoWarsTore.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:21:20.824 --> 01:21:24.566]  And all the money from that sale is going into keeping InfoWars airing.
[01:21:24.586 --> 01:21:27.749]  I'm going to just say this briefly because even my crew, we're great people, get confused.
[01:21:28.289 --> 01:21:30.871]  There are 20 plus types of bankruptcy in the U.S.
[01:21:31.391 --> 01:21:33.352]  Chapter 5 is to keep a company going.
[01:21:33.412 --> 01:21:35.474]  It's an emergency reorganization.
[01:21:36.872 --> 01:21:39.514]  Because the plaintiff's lawyers claim I make $20 million a year.
[01:21:41.075 --> 01:21:42.536]  They claim I've got hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:21:42.636 --> 01:21:43.937]  I don't have $2 million in cash.
[01:21:45.178 --> 01:21:47.259]  And I don't have stocks and bonds, any of this stuff.
[01:21:47.639 --> 01:21:48.300]  None of that's true.
[01:21:49.020 --> 01:22:05.144]   So we're in the bankruptcy court to then basically keep InfoWars on air and the crew, because under Chapter 5, It will go on then and be reorganized, and then any profit will go to these blood-sucking globalists and these ambulance chasers.
[01:22:05.164 --> 01:22:06.385]  But there's hardly any profit anyways.
[01:22:06.666 --> 01:22:08.888]  But they don't want us to stay on air and get money.
[01:22:09.148 --> 01:22:10.409]  They've said, shut him down.
[01:22:10.449 --> 01:22:21.238]  In fact, I gave it to you guys Friday, and Rob do have the clip of their lawyer a month ago in Austin last week in Connecticut saying, we want him off the air, shut him down.
[01:22:21.258 --> 01:22:22.700]  And I forgot to play that Friday.
[01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:23.941]  Can you guys grab that?
[01:22:25.621 --> 01:22:26.402]  You know the one I'm talking about.
[01:22:26.442 --> 01:22:32.326]  If not, I saw it on that YouTube channel, is where that's at.
[01:22:32.646 --> 01:22:38.750]  But it's just a minute and a half clip, and it's them saying, we don't want Jones's money, we want him off the air.
[01:22:40.792 --> 01:22:45.135]  So understand, what they call Chapter 5 is basically a zombie operation.
[01:22:46.236 --> 01:22:49.258]  Infowars will become an invincible zombie in Chapter 5.
[01:22:49.458 --> 01:23:00.162]   I won't get money, or negligible, I'm not getting paid anything yet, And it keeps going and the crew gets paid and we continue on, their lawsuits don't work.
[01:23:00.182 --> 01:23:01.843]  Because their goal is to shut us down.
[01:23:02.043 --> 01:23:04.945]  Well, federal law is you can't just go after businesses to shut them down.
[01:23:06.025 --> 01:23:07.806]  So we're using their own laws against them.
[01:23:10.728 --> 01:23:16.611]  And so that's why we have to make this bankruptcy work to keep the operation going.
[01:23:16.631 --> 01:23:19.733]  Because I can't pay these big giant judgments in these kangaroo courts.
[01:23:19.773 --> 01:23:20.313]  But it's okay.
[01:23:20.533 --> 01:23:22.774]  If we don't have the money, we can continue on.
[01:23:22.954 --> 01:23:25.756]  But we've got to have enough money to operate.
[01:23:27.384 --> 01:23:32.109]  So don't be surprised you wake up in a few months and I'm like, okay, we got a month left.
[01:23:32.129 --> 01:23:32.929]  We're closing down.
[01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:34.491]  I'm gonna do a show over here now.
[01:23:34.571 --> 01:23:34.731]  Bye.
[01:23:34.791 --> 01:23:34.991]  Bye.
[01:23:35.012 --> 01:23:36.673]  I love everybody that could happen.
[01:23:37.234 --> 01:23:42.459]  We're probably not it's probably not gonna happen, but we are right there in the edge of the red and the black.
[01:23:44.341 --> 01:23:47.664]  Right there on the edge of the red and the black and we've got to be in the black.
[01:23:48.772 --> 01:23:53.654]  To show that we can pay these pirates their toll, which they don't want.
[01:23:53.714 --> 01:23:55.314]  But under the law, they're going to get it.
[01:23:55.334 --> 01:23:57.875]  And they're going to sit there and get their money every month.
[01:23:59.535 --> 01:24:00.896]  You know, I'm going to appeal this.
[01:24:01.056 --> 01:24:02.056]  We're talking two years from now.
[01:24:02.576 --> 01:24:03.957]  But we've got to have money to make it through the bankruptcy.
[01:24:04.237 --> 01:24:06.717]  We're going to appeal in a couple of years.
[01:24:06.918 --> 01:24:07.738]  Okay, then.
[01:24:07.758 --> 01:24:08.858]  All right.
[01:24:08.958 --> 01:24:12.959]  If we're still around, then, oh, you get the profit, which there's almost no profit.
[01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:14.900]  You guys found that clip?
[01:24:16.179 --> 01:24:29.902]  I ask that with your verdict, you not only take Alex Jones' platform that he talks about away, I ask that you make certain he can't rebuild the platform.
[01:24:30.442 --> 01:24:31.462]  That's what matters.
[01:24:33.543 --> 01:24:43.665]  Take him out of this discourse, of this misinformation, of this peddling of lies, and make sure he can't do it again.
[01:24:45.365 --> 01:24:46.386]  That is punishment.
[01:24:47.386 --> 01:24:48.487]  That is deterrence.
[01:24:52.289 --> 01:24:54.450]  But somewhere out there right now is another thing.
[01:24:56.271 --> 01:24:57.771]  Getting everything ready for school.
[01:24:59.632 --> 01:25:00.473]  Fixing their lunches.
[01:25:01.573 --> 01:25:02.134]  Going to work.
[01:25:02.594 --> 01:25:03.394]  Picking up their kids.
[01:25:03.414 --> 01:25:07.936]  And there's going to be a day when that child doesn't come home from school.
[01:25:08.217 --> 01:25:09.937]  And we know it, and it's sad, and that's the reality.
[01:25:09.958 --> 01:25:13.958]   And the question's going to be, where is Alex Jones when that happens?
[01:25:13.958 --> 01:25:16.958]  Is he in the studio?
[01:25:16.958 --> 01:25:18.958]  Getting ready to announce?
[01:25:18.958 --> 01:25:21.538]  (upbeat music)
[01:25:20.617 --> 01:25:22.418]  Or will you stop?
[01:25:22.438 --> 01:25:28.561]  That's going to be in your hands.
[01:25:30.021 --> 01:25:34.021]   And if we get all done with all the evidence, we're going to come back with our answers.
[01:25:34.021 --> 01:25:37.021]  Because that's what justice is in this case.
[01:25:38.021 --> 01:25:43.082]   So here are these ambulance chasers admitting they don't just want your guns, they want your tongue, they want your
[01:25:43.082 --> 01:25:44.021]  free speech.
[01:25:44.021 --> 01:25:49.021]   And they want to preemptively take me off the air so that I can't question events.
[01:25:49.296 --> 01:26:00.386]  And I'm going to question Jussie Smollett, I'm going to question WDs in Iraq, I'm going to question all these false flags the left have been caught launching, and they don't want that because they want to silence you.
[01:26:01.247 --> 01:26:06.051]  There's a way to beat these monsters, these trial lawyers, these ambulance chasers, these Democratic Party operatives.
[01:26:07.290 --> 01:26:34.015]  Go to Infowarsstore.com, get books, get films, get supplements, get water filters, get things that empower you and your body and your soul so you can hear the two-hour commercial-free global bombshell with David Icke and so you can go to Bandai Video and get that censored information and share it with your friends and family and strangers and neighbors.

[01:27:13.190 --> 01:27:14.651]  They're so angry you're awake.
[01:27:14.891 --> 01:27:16.692]  They're so angry you won't give up.
[01:27:19.107 --> 01:27:29.532]  But whatever you do, take this interview with David Icke, that's going to be archived at Bandop Video as soon as this show's over, and share it like your life depends on it, because it does.

[01:29:35.322 --> 01:29:37.523]  Talk if you can for a moment about the safety.
[01:29:37.403 --> 01:29:40.842]   what have you learned about serious side effects in this vaccine?
[01:29:40.842 --> 01:29:53.322]   Do you anticipate or maybe stay up at night thinking about the possibility you're going
[01:29:53.322 --> 01:30:04.282]   to have to go back in the lab at some point and come up with something better?
[01:30:04.572 --> 01:30:09.836]  Many of your medicines we know from the COVID vaccine, very effective, very welcome.
[01:30:10.557 --> 01:30:14.640]  The logistics around that vaccine were not straightforward because of the new technology.
[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:16.782]  It's not like we control the world.
[01:30:17.382 --> 01:30:20.882]  All rise for the reptilian anthem!
[01:30:20.882 --> 01:30:35.581]  Let's get down to business.
[01:30:35.625 --> 01:30:37.226]  Let's talk about Reptoids.
[01:30:37.366 --> 01:30:41.108]  Be sure to follow these do's and don'ts to avoid a diplomatic incident.
[01:30:42.069 --> 01:30:45.551]  Do offer them a cricket, mouse, or vole out of your pocket.
[01:30:45.911 --> 01:30:48.813]  Fun fact about voles, a vole ate my father.
[01:30:49.912 --> 01:30:55.698]  Don't use loaded phrases like, Hissy fit, or see you later, alligator.
[01:30:56.138 --> 01:30:56.679]  Got it.
[01:30:56.759 --> 01:30:57.700]  Be respectful.
[01:30:57.860 --> 01:30:59.121]  So when do we talk about the Orchies?
[01:30:59.702 --> 01:31:00.743]  Oh, come on!
[01:31:00.843 --> 01:31:04.126]  So the song Shake It Off was about how I shed my skin every thousand years.
[01:31:04.266 --> 01:31:07.409]  And the song Bad Blood was about how I drink blood out of my Grammys.
[01:31:08.931 --> 01:31:10.733]  A toast to blood!
[01:31:11.133 --> 01:31:12.474]  Save some blood for Paul Rudd.
[01:31:14.716 --> 01:31:16.438]  I gave you my kidney!
[01:31:17.038 --> 01:31:18.340]  And it was delicious!
[01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:26.067]  Reagan, meet my favorite Reptoid zentitives, Barb Shrike and Zarthax Griswold Walton of the Reptoid High Council!
[01:31:26.527 --> 01:31:28.730]  Good evening, your Lizardness.
[01:31:28.990 --> 01:31:30.992]  We Reptoids have had a great decade.
[01:31:31.372 --> 01:31:39.080]  Thanks to propaganda in the media, we have made society more tolerant of our kind, from the Geico Gecko to the Shape of Water.
[01:31:40.023 --> 01:31:42.925]  We even got K. Rool in Smash!
[01:31:43.125 --> 01:31:44.245]  We did it, everyone!
[01:31:44.506 --> 01:31:46.246]  The world temperature is rising.
[01:31:46.447 --> 01:31:47.927]  The time is coming, brethren.
[01:31:48.128 --> 01:31:55.992]  Soon we shall fulfill the prophecy, overthrow humanity, and become the true rulers of the world!
[01:32:00.654 --> 01:32:01.535]  Bizarre video.
[01:32:01.555 --> 01:32:03.036]  Pfizer CEO shocks the world.
[01:32:03.096 --> 01:32:03.876]  Banned out video.
[01:32:03.896 --> 01:32:22.213]   We're having a little fun here, and I got David Icke on this emergency Saturday show because I want to cover The wheels coming off this, the whole Pfizer-Covid hysteria, them admitting it erases your immune system, it kills you, euthanizing the old people, Russia, the pipeline, Elon Musk and his AI robots.
[01:32:23.213 --> 01:32:25.255]  So much to talk about with the iconic David Icke.
[01:32:25.315 --> 01:32:27.556]  DavidIcke.com or Iconic.com.
[01:32:27.596 --> 01:32:30.598]  He has his own channel on Banned.Video, David Icke.
[01:32:31.283 --> 01:32:32.644]  David, great to have you here.
[01:32:32.804 --> 01:32:33.884]  It's commercial free.
[01:32:33.904 --> 01:32:35.085]  We got about 50 minutes with you.
[01:32:35.105 --> 01:32:36.285]  I appreciate you coming on with us.
[01:32:36.745 --> 01:32:38.706]  I'm going to try to sit back and let you roll here.
[01:32:38.766 --> 01:32:40.447]  Love the new studio.
[01:32:40.507 --> 01:32:42.828]  Love how you've been fighting back and not giving in to the censorship.
[01:32:43.268 --> 01:32:44.909]  So you're quite the icon here.
[01:32:45.289 --> 01:32:46.209]  Total trailblazer.
[01:32:46.269 --> 01:32:47.150]  Great to have you here with us.
[01:32:48.330 --> 01:32:48.871]  Thanks, mate.
[01:32:48.991 --> 01:33:06.239]   I'll tell you what, it might be a good place to start, you know, with the subject in the intro, because When I came out with all that stuff a long time ago now, decades ago.
[01:33:06.259 --> 01:33:07.199]  30 years ago.
[01:33:08.159 --> 01:33:16.141]  That it's, in the end, what you're looking at is a non-human force manipulating human society.
[01:33:16.981 --> 01:33:23.543]  Of course people thought that was crazy and that was ridiculous and he's crazy and he's mad and all the rest of it.
[01:33:24.562 --> 01:33:57.683]   But as it's become more and more obvious, Alex, that what we're looking at is an anti-human agenda, in which the very basics of human survival are being very blatantly targeted, more and more and more people are beginning to ask the question, well, maybe if we're looking at this extreme anti-human agenda, Maybe there's a non-human force behind it then.
[01:33:58.503 --> 01:34:02.265]  Because we're looking at, look at the basics, the basics of life.
[01:34:03.085 --> 01:34:11.910]  The food, warmth, the atmosphere is being changed and you are looking at water.
[01:34:13.553 --> 01:34:17.614]  Supplies and access increasingly being targeted.
[01:34:18.335 --> 01:34:23.816]  All these different areas of basic human survival are being targeted.
[01:34:23.856 --> 01:34:32.559]  And then you look at the human body, which is, as they call it, a biological phenomenon.
[01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:41.102]  And then you see these fake vaccines, which they've created this COVID hoax to justify, of course.
[01:34:42.128 --> 01:35:05.977]  And they're putting synthetic genetic material into the body, which as we've seen many, many, many times now, is self-replicating and building nanotechnology systems, which, I say, are designed to connect the human body, the human brain, to what they call the cloud.
[01:35:07.157 --> 01:35:29.486]   And at the same time, the cloud is being created Not just by 5G towers and 6G and 7G in the pipeline, but from increasingly from low orbit satellites, vast numbers of them being put up there by Elon Musk, who's supposed to be a man of the people who cares about our freedom of speech.
[01:35:30.287 --> 01:35:44.338]   Well, it's funny because creating this cloud and then Connecting the human brain to it via nanotechnology is straight off the script of this global cult, as I call it.
[01:35:45.058 --> 01:35:54.524]  And this global cult is the same cult that's behind the global destruction of freedom of speech and all the censorship.
[01:35:56.025 --> 01:36:10.808]   So, you know, I think what we need to do a little bit, those that are beginning to see this, is to realize where it's coming from.
[01:36:12.530 --> 01:36:27.181]  From where I come from, is that this world we call the human world, the so-called physical world that we're interacting with, that's like a movie screen.
[01:36:28.410 --> 01:36:35.074]  When it hits the movie screen, if you're sitting in a movie theater, when the film hits the screen, it's a done deal.
[01:36:35.594 --> 01:36:36.654]  You're not changing it then.
[01:36:37.435 --> 01:36:41.757]  You're changing it from where it's being projected from, where it's coming from.
[01:36:42.798 --> 01:36:55.871]   And the reason that the nature of reality The nature of the true I is not taught in the schools and the universities.
[01:36:56.571 --> 01:36:58.772]  It's not explored by the media.
[01:36:58.792 --> 01:37:16.601]   It's because we're not meant to know that, because once we realize the nature of reality, the nature of the I, the nature of who we are, the nature of what this is, the pennies drop on how the whole thing, the whole deal, is being orchestrated.
[01:37:17.161 --> 01:37:20.462]  And that's what I go into in my new book just out called The Trap.
[01:37:21.322 --> 01:37:34.267]  So, first of all, we have to realize, if we're going to grasp this, is what we call the world of the seen is not everything that exists in the space that we're looking at.
[01:37:35.127 --> 01:37:41.670]  It's a tiny, tiny, ridiculously tiny band of frequency, which we call visible light.
[01:37:42.887 --> 01:37:50.272]  And visible light is a smear, an absolute smear, a fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum.
[01:37:50.092 --> 01:37:55.412]   And according to mainstream science, that electromagnetic spectrum within which visible
[01:37:55.412 --> 01:37:59.812]  light, the only band we can see, is a tiny part.
[01:37:59.812 --> 01:38:09.372]   That spectrum itself is only around 0.005% of what exists in what they call the universe.
[01:38:09.372 --> 01:38:21.672]   So we are seeing next to nothing, and to understand that is to grasp how these non-human entities,
[01:38:21.672 --> 01:38:25.892]   in the end this consciousness that's manipulating human society, can be manipulated.
[01:38:26.656 --> 01:38:31.459]  Can do it without us being it being seen as seeing.
[01:38:31.799 --> 01:38:38.383]  And David, to interrupt, as you've been saying for 30 years, I've read most of your books, haven't read the new one, but I read the first book she wrote 30 years ago that have been proven to be that on.
[01:38:39.124 --> 01:38:41.405]  They don't even want us in the visual light spectrum.
[01:38:41.425 --> 01:38:43.606]  They want us in the VR, in the Matrix.
[01:38:43.646 --> 01:38:48.309]  They want to even get us out of what we can see at this level to be able to totally confuse us.
[01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:52.732]  And that's part of the lockdowns they now admit was forcing us into the metaverse.
[01:38:53.911 --> 01:39:06.362]   Yeah, I mean, from where I'm coming from, and you know, just after the turn of the millennium, I said that This reality is actually a simulation.
[01:39:06.762 --> 01:39:08.022]  It's a virtual reality.
[01:39:08.483 --> 01:39:14.865]  It's an illusion to confuse us and to hijack our perception of reality.
[01:39:15.525 --> 01:39:28.730]   And I said at that time that the limit of this simulation, at the level we experience it as the human world, Because there are other levels of it, which I talk about in the trap.
[01:39:29.850 --> 01:39:32.931]  That limit is the speed of light.
[01:39:33.811 --> 01:39:39.572]  So the speed of light is not the fastest speed possible, as people like Einstein said.
[01:39:39.812 --> 01:39:40.153]  No, no.
[01:39:40.813 --> 01:39:42.913]  It's pedestrian compared with what's possible.
[01:39:43.173 --> 01:39:50.335]  But it is the limit of this simulation, which is why it appears to be the fastest speed when you're in the simulation.
[01:39:51.095 --> 01:40:10.025]  And then in the spring of 2021, Scientific American ran a story, an article by an academic, and he said that he'd concluded that we live in a simulation and the limit of the simulation is the speed of light.
[01:40:10.786 --> 01:40:25.686]   And one of the things I've been saying over the decades is that what we call the laws of physics are actually The coding that's written into the simulation.
[01:40:26.146 --> 01:40:39.974]  So when you're creating a virtual reality game, which mimics the reality we're in, you write the codes, you write the rules of the game, the limits of the game, what you can do, what you can't do.
[01:40:41.015 --> 01:40:52.493]   And what we call the laws of physics are actually The rules of the simulation, which have been put in there as part of the control system.
[01:40:53.093 --> 01:41:09.097]  And what this academic said in Scientific American is that we live in a simulation, its limit is speed of light, and he related, and I say quite rightly, the speed of light to processing speed.
[01:41:09.877 --> 01:41:22.382]   So if you're writing a virtual reality computer game, Then you write the rules, but even though you're doing that, you're still limited by your processing speed, as this article said.
[01:41:23.443 --> 01:41:25.403]  And so that's the limit of the simulation.
[01:41:26.483 --> 01:41:30.765]  And so this is like a projection.
[01:41:30.825 --> 01:41:36.766]  I do explain in the books how it's created, how we actually create it, in fact.
[01:41:37.467 --> 01:41:39.587]  But it's the projection.
[01:41:39.667 --> 01:41:42.168]  So the question is, where does the projection come from?
[01:41:42.808 --> 01:41:43.469]  Where does this?
[01:41:44.069 --> 01:42:00.883]  Because, you know, if you look at the Matrix movies, Alex, in the symbolism of them, the Neo and Morpheus, etc, they're in the ship, they're outside the Matrix, outside of it.
[01:42:02.364 --> 01:42:13.082]   And so what happens is they go into the Matrix with that probe in the back of the neck, actually in the reptilian brain part, of the human brain, funnily enough.
[01:42:13.082 --> 01:42:19.962]   And they go into the matrix, not with their bodies, they go into them with their minds.
[01:42:19.962 --> 01:42:25.222]   And that's what I'm talking about in the trap, about how actually all this is happening in our mind.
[01:42:25.222 --> 01:42:27.601]  It's literally is a mind game.
[01:42:27.601 --> 01:42:30.481]  Where's the mind?
[01:42:30.481 --> 01:42:38.282]   Okay, basically, a little bit more to it than this, yes, but basically, a way of putting it really simply,
[01:42:38.282 --> 01:42:43.601]   is if you can't see it, then it's not in this dimension.
[01:42:43.601 --> 01:42:46.682]   I'm And so it's in another dimension.
[01:42:48.194 --> 01:42:49.175]  You can see a brain.
[01:42:49.835 --> 01:42:51.416]  Yeah, okay, there's the brain.
[01:42:51.937 --> 01:42:54.879]  Well, therefore, it's in this reality.
[01:42:54.919 --> 01:42:56.360]  We'll call it 3D reality.
[01:42:56.460 --> 01:42:57.420]  There it is, the brain.
[01:42:57.821 --> 01:43:02.464]  But the brain is not the source of consciousness.
[01:43:03.384 --> 01:43:07.687]  What it does is process information.
[01:43:07.727 --> 01:43:08.408]  It's the receiver.
[01:43:09.348 --> 01:43:11.930]  Yeah, it's a receiver in that sense.
[01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:14.252]  It processes information.
[01:43:14.332 --> 01:43:17.494]  Now, the question is, where does that information come from?
[01:43:18.399 --> 01:43:26.463]  Because we have this whole concept now, although science denied it, right up to quite recently.
[01:43:26.903 --> 01:43:31.186]  I mean, what you said 25 years ago is now accepted mainline science.
[01:43:31.226 --> 01:43:43.492]  I read it in Scientific America, everywhere, all the big billionaires, they sound like David Icke now, but they say, oh, we're going to jack into it and create a new reality for you, instead of not letting you know that we can break free of this as well.
[01:43:44.841 --> 01:43:47.904]  I mean, obviously, they're not going to bring us into some bigger, better reality.
[01:43:47.944 --> 01:43:50.847]  Everything they do is to make the reality smaller and more controlled.
[01:43:52.148 --> 01:43:55.251]  More and more myopia of sense of reality.
[01:43:55.291 --> 01:43:56.612]  That's what the metaverse is about.
[01:43:56.772 --> 01:44:00.736]  It's about creating a simulation within a simulation.
[01:44:00.816 --> 01:44:03.258]  In fact, a simulation within a simulation within a simulation.
[01:44:03.698 --> 01:44:05.981]  So you've got the simulation we call the human world.
[01:44:06.521 --> 01:44:10.305]  Then you've got the smart grid, which is actually another simulation.
[01:44:10.945 --> 01:44:13.709]  And then you've got the metaverse, which is another simulation.
[01:44:13.829 --> 01:44:21.518]  And they admit the Internet of Things, the smart grid, is a new world, they call it, a new dimension they're creating of the machines interfacing and directing us.
[01:44:21.859 --> 01:44:23.000]  So it's a prison grid.
[01:44:23.341 --> 01:44:28.287]  That's exactly what they're doing, and that's why people should look at Elon Musk and ask, what the heck are you doing?
[01:44:28.927 --> 01:44:31.648]  No, no, no, not virtually.
[01:44:32.069 --> 01:44:37.071]  Everything he does and produces is straight off the script of the cult.
[01:44:37.471 --> 01:44:43.253]  But I was saying, you've got the brain, so you can see that, that's in this reality, and it's processing information.
[01:44:43.694 --> 01:44:54.697]   And this concept of brain placidity, there's a a plasticity about the brain in this sense.
[01:44:54.697 --> 01:45:00.497]   They believed until relatively recently that once the brain formed, that was it.
[01:45:00.497 --> 01:45:01.856]  That was the brain for your life.
[01:45:01.856 --> 01:45:03.736]  Now they know very different.
[01:45:03.736 --> 01:45:10.936]   They know that the brain changes according to the information it receives.
[01:45:11.285 --> 01:45:15.426]  So if you have one source of information, i.e.
[01:45:15.846 --> 01:45:36.945]   the cult narrative, let's say, in all its forms, and you never look outside of that for other forms of information and other explanations, your brain, and this is mainstream science now, Your brain will process information and all the neurons and the neuron networks will form to process that information.
[01:45:37.185 --> 01:45:39.886]  And let me interrupt you because you're right, this is mainline science now.
[01:45:40.327 --> 01:45:45.229]  Blue Light is making little girls go into puberty earlier just from iPads and screens.
[01:45:45.609 --> 01:45:47.470]  That's mainline scientific study two weeks ago.
[01:45:47.890 --> 01:46:05.602]   And they admit that people that watch more TV, that isn't interactive, people that just sit there and vegetate, Don't grow the new neuron networks and literally get early onset of Alzheimer's and die early and they admit young people in South Korea are dying from watching 20 hours of television a day because your body just literally turns off.
[01:46:06.162 --> 01:46:08.044]  Bottom line, this stuff is killing us.
[01:46:09.305 --> 01:46:26.945]   A very simple way of doing an analogy for this is imagine that you had Wi-Fi which is outside the computer or around us.
[01:46:28.526 --> 01:46:42.357]  But you program the computer not to read, decode, process vast amounts of information in Wi-Fi.
[01:46:43.258 --> 01:46:46.020]  What you would do, the information would still be there.
[01:46:47.270 --> 01:47:01.445]  But it wouldn't be in a form that you could see and interact with because the computer would not take that Wi-Fi and put it on the screen in the form of words, graphics, moving pictures and so on.
[01:47:01.966 --> 01:47:04.228]  And that's what they're doing with the human brain.
[01:47:04.748 --> 01:47:09.534]  They are because they know about this malleable nature of the brain.
[01:47:10.174 --> 01:47:18.003]  They are trying, this is one level of it, they're trying to just let you have one source of information.
[01:47:18.023 --> 01:47:19.424]  That's what censorship is all about.
[01:47:19.945 --> 01:47:24.650]  So that your brain forms, your neurons and your networks form to process that.
[01:47:25.131 --> 01:47:43.151]   And literally, If you're in that mode, and it solidifies enough, it doesn't matter what information you receive in other ways, because this is why people look at others, say, in the Covid era, and they say,
[01:47:44.491 --> 01:47:46.111]  Why can't they get it?
[01:47:46.311 --> 01:47:47.392]  It's so obvious!
[01:47:47.472 --> 01:47:56.633]  Well, it's obvious to you because your brain is in a state where it can process that information that sees through the illusion.
[01:47:56.693 --> 01:48:14.717]   But if you're stuck in this repetitive, that the brain will only decode certain information, which is basically frequencies, then you're literally not going to be able to compute What's actually happening?
[01:48:15.437 --> 01:48:18.339]  And this is why they want us only to see the mainstream media.
[01:48:18.639 --> 01:48:19.799]  Shut off all other media.
[01:48:19.819 --> 01:48:20.860]  That's why they're going for you.
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:26.503]  Because they want to control the source of information.
[01:48:26.803 --> 01:48:29.144]  Because from the information comes our perception.
[01:48:29.444 --> 01:48:34.047]  From our perception comes the way the brain wires itself.
[01:48:35.103 --> 01:48:50.033]  And they're terrified of other information being made available to people, which will, over time, and with some who are more malleable immediately, will get them to see actually there's a different way of looking at the world.
[01:48:50.173 --> 01:48:57.458]  And at that point, the brain, in its malleable nature, will start changing and start firing in a different way.
[01:48:57.498 --> 01:49:02.161]  And it will start processing another form, sense of reality and perception.
[01:49:02.201 --> 01:49:03.562]  Now that's what they don't want.
[01:49:04.422 --> 01:49:10.825]  What they have to do is hold us purely in five sense reality.
[01:49:11.165 --> 01:49:19.829]  Because once we are processing information and processing our perceptions only through five sense reality, they got us.
[01:49:20.269 --> 01:49:23.071]  We're in the trap, we're in the jail, we're in the cell.
[01:49:26.432 --> 01:49:30.714]  They are seeking to control, in every way, the information that we receive.
[01:49:30.734 --> 01:49:33.436]  And there's no doubt they're doing that, and you've been vindicated in spades.
[01:49:33.496 --> 01:49:36.277]  So big picture, because I want to go through a lot of current issues with you.
[01:49:36.818 --> 01:49:44.081]  How are things going for the architects of this post-human world, this cyborg takeover matrix they admit they're now launching?
[01:49:45.142 --> 01:49:46.743]  How would you lay out the current state of the world?
[01:49:46.763 --> 01:49:50.465]  Because it seems like there's a huge awakening happening, but they're also coming down on us with both feet.
[01:49:52.034 --> 01:49:58.696]  Yeah, I mean, we are in a real state of transition here.
[01:49:59.076 --> 01:50:03.517]  And we go a certain way and we'll dismantle this.
[01:50:03.657 --> 01:50:07.358]  We go another way and it will get more and more extreme.
[01:50:07.558 --> 01:50:11.039]  And again, we come back to the same thing, Alex.
[01:50:11.119 --> 01:50:23.038]   The stadium in which this is all playing out, and the stadium in which the outcome of the game will be decided, is the human mind.
[01:50:23.638 --> 01:50:24.619]  That's it!
[01:50:25.059 --> 01:50:29.984]  Because as I was saying, you can see the brain, so it's in this reality.
[01:50:30.385 --> 01:50:31.486]  So where's the mind?
[01:50:31.546 --> 01:50:35.830]  You can't see the mind, just as you can't see Wi-Fi, but you know it's there.
[01:50:36.250 --> 01:50:43.115]   The mind is on the level that we directly interact with, with the brain is an electromagnetic field.
[01:50:43.655 --> 01:50:48.997]  That's beyond the limits of visible light, human sight, but it's there.
[01:50:49.438 --> 01:50:51.978]  It's in another, what you would call, dimension.
[01:50:52.799 --> 01:51:04.703]  And, you know, people talk about a dimension of reality that is very close to this one on the dial, and they call it the astral dimension.
[01:51:04.763 --> 01:51:06.344]  Some people call it the fourth dimension.
[01:51:07.108 --> 01:51:21.912]  And in the lower levels of that fourth dimension, that lower levels of that astral dimension, which is very close in frequency terms to this world, that's where it's being orchestrated from, as I go into at length in the trap.
[01:51:22.652 --> 01:51:33.735]  And, you know, this is where these entities are that are orchestrating this global cult in the world of the seen, through people like Schwab and Gates and all the rest of them.
[01:51:33.775 --> 01:51:36.336]  Talk about the trap, the new book, and these entities.
[01:51:38.137 --> 01:51:57.547]  Well, once you realize, Alex, that this reality, this global conspiracy, is ultimately being manipulated from this lower fourth dimension, lower astral dimension, then so much falls into place.
[01:51:58.567 --> 01:52:05.891]  Why do these people in the cult take part in satanism and satanic ritual?
[01:52:06.912 --> 01:52:09.353]  Because who are they interacting with?
[01:52:10.113 --> 01:52:12.974]  Because they are interacting with entities.
[01:52:13.034 --> 01:52:16.315]  I mean, these people may be mad, but they're not completely stupid.
[01:52:17.435 --> 01:52:25.338]  And they're interacting with these entities in this lower fourth, lower astral dimension from where all this is coming.
[01:52:25.618 --> 01:52:29.239]  So they do their rituals and they keep doing them.
[01:52:29.439 --> 01:52:41.930]   You know, you see when you look into this, I know you have over the years, That they're doing Babylonian rituals, they're doing Egyptian rituals now.
[01:52:43.010 --> 01:52:43.491]  Why?
[01:52:44.111 --> 01:52:46.832]  Why are they doing ancient rituals now?
[01:52:47.272 --> 01:53:13.128]   Because those ancient rituals were specifically designed to create a vibrational environment which thins out The difference in frequency between this reality and this lower astral reality, and if you keep doing this in the same place over and over again, then it thins it out even more.
[01:53:13.228 --> 01:53:20.593]  And I've talked to people who've taken part in these rituals over the years, different parts of the world, because it's a global phenomenon.
[01:53:21.414 --> 01:53:41.638]   And they explain how these often hideous looking entities, often taking a reptilian form, not always but often, slip into this reality during the ritual, where these satanists, and these super satanists, which is what the elite are, are interacting with them.
[01:53:42.799 --> 01:53:49.524]  And so that's what they're doing, that's what the rituals are for, to create this interaction.
[01:53:49.604 --> 01:53:53.227]  Now, what do Satanists do also?
[01:53:53.287 --> 01:53:57.810]  They sacrifice kids, they sacrifice adults too, but they sacrifice kids.
[01:53:58.311 --> 01:53:59.592]  Why do they do that?
[01:54:01.198 --> 01:54:17.286]  Why did the ancients say in places like Central America and all over the world actually, say Babylon, we are sacrificing young virgins, children or someone else to the gods.
[01:54:17.566 --> 01:54:18.467]  What does that mean?
[01:54:18.587 --> 01:54:19.547]  Why would they do that?
[01:54:19.988 --> 01:54:33.124]   Because You come back to the Matrix movie and the Morpheus character and he's holding up a battery and he says the machines have turned humans into one of these.
[01:54:33.604 --> 01:54:36.808]  In other words, a source of energy.
[01:54:37.428 --> 01:54:48.946]   Now these, in this lower astral dimension where all this is being orchestrated from, The vibration is very low and very slow.
[01:54:49.006 --> 01:54:50.727]  That's why they are what they are.
[01:54:51.627 --> 01:54:57.391]  That's why they are so what we would call evil, which I define as the absence of love.
[01:54:58.272 --> 01:55:18.044]   And so to absorb energy from another source, that energy has to be within the frequency band that these entities Operate on, otherwise they can't absorb it, like two radio stations passing in the same space but not interfering with each other.
[01:55:18.644 --> 01:55:32.613]  The energy they want is the energy which is the energy of them, it's the energy of fear, the energy of terror, the energy of anxiety, of depression, all these low vibrational emotional human states.
[01:55:32.673 --> 01:55:38.216]  And that's what they wanted during the COVID deal, record suicide, record depression, families breaking up, people isolated.
[01:55:38.596 --> 01:55:39.617]  That's what they feed off of.
[01:55:40.549 --> 01:55:49.134]  Yes, and you know, fear of nuclear war, fear of not having enough food, fear of the price of energy, all these things.
[01:55:50.314 --> 01:56:06.823]  You take a world war, it's a bloody banquet to these entities because of all the emotional charge that goes into fighting the war, all the emotional charge from people back home who are terrified that their loved one is not going to come home.
[01:56:06.843 --> 01:56:10.545]   So it's interdimensional transference of Of psychic energy.
[01:56:11.526 --> 01:56:13.247]  Of energy, yeah, of emotional energy.
[01:56:13.327 --> 01:56:23.515]  And so they've set up this reality to generate maximum amounts of low vibrational emotional energy.
[01:56:23.535 --> 01:56:24.776]  And of course they've done it very well.
[01:56:25.136 --> 01:56:29.499]  And they are then feeding off this energy and it's empowering them.
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:33.102]  They don't want people getting on.
[01:56:33.877 --> 01:56:37.621]  They don't want people loving each other.
[01:56:37.841 --> 01:56:45.789]  They don't want people having joy and happiness and contentment, because these are high frequency energies.
[01:56:45.829 --> 01:56:58.260]   For instance, when you're in a low frequency state, a low emotional state, let's put it that way, but it's a low frequency state in other words, People say things like, I feel so heavy today.
[01:56:59.260 --> 01:56:59.900]  Why is that?
[01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:08.984]  Because that state of perception, emotion, is generating these low, slow frequencies.
[01:57:09.164 --> 01:57:15.687]  And studies are now showing that electromagnetic, artificial, 5G, and other systems are actually making people depressed.
[01:57:15.707 --> 01:57:20.153]   So they're artificially putting us into that That type of system.
[01:57:20.993 --> 01:57:24.536]  I forget the name, but the crews... Sorry, go ahead.
[01:57:24.616 --> 01:57:27.738]  And this is why, this is the point, this is why they're doing it.
[01:57:28.238 --> 01:58:03.328]   So when you are generating these low, slow frequencies through a low emotional state, or they're coming the other way through this cloud and these low orbit satellites and towers, Then the energy, the frequencies going through your energetic field are low and slow and so when that happens the field gets denser and you feel this, oh I feel so heavy, but when you feel joy and love and happiness, yeah life's great, then they are high, fast,
[01:58:04.989 --> 01:58:09.552]  Frequencies that are generated from those emotional and perceptual states.
[01:58:09.992 --> 01:58:16.856]  And so they go through your energetic field and they vibrate it very quickly and it becomes lighter.
[01:58:17.477 --> 01:58:21.459]  So people say, I feel so light today because I feel so good.
[01:58:21.979 --> 01:58:24.961]  So it's at this level, you see, and this is the other thing.
[01:58:25.001 --> 01:58:29.204]  I've done this in some of my books, but back it was, I think it was the 1950s.
[01:58:31.431 --> 01:58:40.736]  That a guy studied the frequencies of different emotional states and actually listed what they were.
[01:58:41.477 --> 01:59:00.656]   And this is the point that we've already introduced, that yes, you can feel an emotional state and generate the frequency, But if the frequency relating to that emotional state is coming the other way through this bloody cloud, then the throttle goes both ways.
[01:59:00.896 --> 01:59:05.137]  And that's how all this mainstream television watching literally is causing Alzheimer's and killing people.
[01:59:05.858 --> 01:59:06.958]  Let me raise this point, David.
[01:59:09.210 --> 01:59:13.234]  How is this operation by this force running?
[01:59:13.814 --> 01:59:14.475]  How is there war?
[01:59:14.495 --> 01:59:16.436]  Because I asked you earlier, you said we're at a crossroads.
[01:59:17.057 --> 01:59:17.597]  I agree.
[01:59:17.798 --> 01:59:19.039]  And how do we transcend it?
[01:59:19.059 --> 01:59:19.739]  Because here's an example.
[01:59:20.300 --> 01:59:28.787]  Certainly we see limited reality, but at one point in the universe of the dimensions, we're seeing what I believe is a limited layer of it, or what you call a simulation, but at least something tangible.
[01:59:29.107 --> 01:59:29.348]  Why?
[01:59:29.428 --> 01:59:35.558]   And literally, as you know, thousands of studies, people don't need studies to know this, You go swimming in the Caribbean or the Mediterranean.
[01:59:35.638 --> 01:59:41.203]  You go out on the stars at night with the moon with your friends and laugh and tell jokes by fire.
[01:59:41.563 --> 01:59:48.489]  You walk through the forest or the fields and you feel light and empowered and connected to the universe and God and the infinite.
[01:59:48.869 --> 01:59:56.376]  But then when you go and plug into the VR matrix, you feel nauseous, you feel sick, you feel depressed, you have nightmares, you don't sleep well.
[01:59:56.816 --> 02:00:00.019]  What is it about being out in nature that counteracts this?
[02:00:03.035 --> 02:00:08.937]  Well, what they're seeking to do is to negate that.
[02:00:10.178 --> 02:00:28.284]  See, at the moment, if you're in a city, I mean, China's the blueprint, obviously, you are bombarded with technologically generated electromagnetic fields that are designed to put you in these low vibrational states.
[02:00:29.420 --> 02:00:32.821]  But up to this point, you've been able to get out of there.
[02:00:33.181 --> 02:00:33.621]  Get out!
[02:00:33.641 --> 02:00:38.882]  I mean, you know, I talk about nature in a different way, but you can get away from that.
[02:00:39.242 --> 02:00:44.624]  You get out into the areas that are not subject to that bombardment.
[02:00:45.444 --> 02:00:49.705]  And therefore you've, I mean, this is these people that have this electro sensitivity.
[02:00:50.461 --> 02:00:58.283]  Where they're so sensitive to electromagnetic fields generated technologically that they become very, very sick.
[02:00:59.004 --> 02:01:06.126]  And they have to go and live in caravans in the forest to get away from it, because that's the only place that they don't feel sick.
[02:01:07.586 --> 02:01:18.313]  You have this, you know, this building syndrome where people get the same thing, where they work in an office surrounded by these, bombarded by these... Sure, what about the Havana syndrome?
[02:01:18.433 --> 02:01:34.284]  Even the top, there's more than 20 CIA scientists sent in who didn't think it was real, they're getting nauseous and super sick now, and I think it's their own devices and their own systems, and what they've tied into is physically making them ill, and they think it's the Russians or the Chinese.
[02:01:35.509 --> 02:01:41.055]  Well, you know, it could be any source of generating electromagnetic field.
[02:01:41.375 --> 02:01:51.326]  So these satellites that are going up, through people like Musk, who's looking at 42,000, well I say eventually, that's the number being given now.
[02:01:52.526 --> 02:02:01.833]  They're seeking to take out or generate these fields of 5G and what follows to every inch of the planet.
[02:02:01.973 --> 02:02:09.938]  And they need to do that in their agenda because they want to connect, not least through what's going into people with these fake vaccines.
[02:02:09.978 --> 02:02:17.344]  And of course, these fake vaccines are planned to be transferred to every other vaccine.
[02:02:18.024 --> 02:02:23.091]  And any other ones that they can justify and come up with with their excuses.
[02:02:23.812 --> 02:02:36.295]   And therefore, if they're going to connect every human to artificial intelligence via the cloud, as they call it, Absolutely.
[02:02:36.795 --> 02:03:03.025]   David, in the time we've got left, I want to move through a lot of the current things that are unfolding and happening, but since you mentioned this, in the 1960s, there was an episode, Day of the Dove, in Star Trek, where an energy-sucking vampire has come on board interdimensionally on the ship, and it's playing The Klingon's off against the humans, and the humans off against each other, and as soon as they figure that out, and become positive and loving, it dissipates, it makes it go away.
[02:03:02.845 --> 02:03:04.845]  Let's play a clip from Day of the Dove.
[02:03:04.845 --> 02:03:26.845]  What is it?
[02:03:26.845 --> 02:03:29.845]  [Music]
[02:03:28.009 --> 02:03:37.076]  Totally unfamiliar.
[02:03:39.478 --> 02:03:39.898]  What did you want?
[02:03:39.918 --> 02:03:43.621]  What are you doing here?
[02:03:43.641 --> 02:03:48.365]  Reporting for duty, sir.
[02:03:48.385 --> 02:03:48.525]  Duty?
[02:03:48.545 --> 02:03:49.446]  Can I release you from sickbay?
[02:03:49.526 --> 02:03:50.266]  I release myself.
[02:03:50.807 --> 02:03:51.747]  Then get back to sickbay.
[02:03:51.788 --> 02:03:52.488]  Now in your life, sir.
[02:03:52.528 --> 02:03:53.529]  I'm fit and ready for action.
[02:03:55.440 --> 02:04:14.789]  And so then they figure out that it's manipulating their emotions.
[02:04:15.849 --> 02:04:23.953]  During Lieutenant Johnson's emotional outburst, his expression of hatred and lust for vengeance, the alien's life energy level increased.
[02:04:25.014 --> 02:04:28.356]  When the lieutenant became unconscious, the alien lost energy.
[02:04:29.717 --> 02:04:32.379]  It subsists on the emotions of others.
[02:04:33.540 --> 02:04:38.183]  This one appears to be strengthened by mental radiations of hostility.
[02:04:39.064 --> 02:04:40.244]  Violent intentions.
[02:04:42.606 --> 02:04:46.489]  It exists on the hate of others.
[02:04:47.609 --> 02:04:48.330]  To put it simply.
[02:04:49.491 --> 02:04:52.553]  And it has acted as a catalyst, creating the situation.
[02:04:53.374 --> 02:05:03.397]  In order to satisfy that need, it has brought together opposing forces, provided crude instruments, in an effort to promote the most violent mode of conflict.
[02:05:04.057 --> 02:05:11.260]  And kept numbers and resources balanced, so that it can maintain a constant state of violence.
[02:05:12.060 --> 02:05:13.860]  It's got to have a vulnerable area.
[02:05:15.861 --> 02:05:16.701]  We've got to get rid of it.
[02:05:17.421 --> 02:05:20.662]  Then all hostile attitudes on board must be eliminated.
[02:05:21.183 --> 02:05:22.023]  The fighting must end.
[02:05:22.742 --> 02:05:23.202]  And soon.
[02:05:23.523 --> 02:05:24.303]  Oh, we're a doomed ship.
[02:05:25.564 --> 02:05:30.668]  Traveling forever between galaxies, filled with eternal bloodlust, eternal warfare.
[02:05:32.650 --> 02:05:34.031]  Kang has got to listen.
[02:05:35.072 --> 02:05:38.975]  We've got to pool our knowledge and get rid of this thing.
[02:05:38.995 --> 02:05:46.961]  It's almost over.
[02:05:46.981 --> 02:05:47.821]  Go back to David Icke.
[02:05:48.322 --> 02:05:51.104]  This is important, though.
[02:05:51.564 --> 02:05:52.465]  Lieutenant DeGroff.
[02:05:54.065 --> 02:05:55.346]  Put me on shipwide intercom.
[02:05:55.726 --> 02:05:57.387]  Aye, sir.
[02:05:58.027 --> 02:05:58.607]  Ready, Captain.
[02:06:01.789 --> 02:06:02.869]  This is Captain Kirk.
[02:06:03.610 --> 02:06:04.450]  A truce is ordered.
[02:06:05.031 --> 02:06:05.811]  The fighting is over.
[02:06:06.530 --> 02:06:08.530]  Lay down your weapons.
[02:06:08.530 --> 02:06:15.530]  Mrs. Kang?
[02:06:15.956 --> 02:06:17.057]  Cease hostilities.
[02:06:18.698 --> 02:06:20.698]  Disarm.
[02:06:20.698 --> 02:06:32.297]  Cessation of violence appears to have weakened it, Captain.
[02:06:32.407 --> 02:06:47.120]  I suggest that good spirits might make an effective weapon.
[02:06:47.180 --> 02:06:47.881]  Get off my ship!
[02:06:49.142 --> 02:06:50.183]  You're a dead duck here.
[02:06:50.203 --> 02:06:50.763]  You're powerless.
[02:06:50.803 --> 02:06:51.604]  We know about you.
[02:06:51.944 --> 02:06:55.707]  And we don't want to play.
[02:06:55.727 --> 02:06:56.048]  Maybe...
[02:06:58.081 --> 02:07:03.683]  Maybe there are others like you around, maybe you've caused a lot of suffering, a lot of history, but that's all over.
[02:07:04.984 --> 02:07:09.806]  We'll be on guard now, we'll be ready for you, so ship out!
[02:07:10.306 --> 02:07:14.248]  Come on, haul it!
[02:07:14.288 --> 02:07:15.348]  Out already!
[02:07:16.849 --> 02:07:17.349]  Out!
[02:07:18.129 --> 02:07:19.830]  We need no urging to hate humans.
[02:07:21.470 --> 02:07:24.372]  For the present, only a fool fights in a burning house.
[02:07:24.931 --> 02:07:31.631]  (laughter)
[02:07:31.631 --> 02:07:36.631]   Alright, so that's a little long clip, but they knew what they were doing when they wrote that back in the late 1960s.
[02:07:37.529 --> 02:07:38.529]  David Icke, your take on that?
[02:07:39.609 --> 02:07:41.330]  Well, I thought that was fantastic, mate.
[02:07:41.530 --> 02:07:45.371]  I mean, it just encapsulated, you know, what I've just been saying.
[02:07:46.471 --> 02:07:47.391]  And this is the thing.
[02:07:47.411 --> 02:07:53.073]  They don't care what we fight about, what we hate each other about.
[02:07:54.020 --> 02:07:59.027]  And what we abuse each other about, what they care about, is that we do all those things.
[02:07:59.568 --> 02:08:01.751]  They're not bothered at why, as long as we do them.
[02:08:02.011 --> 02:08:05.977]  And notice the point is made that it equalizes the forces to keep it going forever.
[02:08:06.277 --> 02:08:07.358]  It's an energy transference.
[02:08:08.075 --> 02:08:11.876]  Yeah, well, this is a point I've made in the books over the years.
[02:08:13.097 --> 02:08:16.538]  This is why I say we don't need to fight.
[02:08:16.618 --> 02:08:19.519]  The last thing we do is fight this force.
[02:08:20.119 --> 02:08:21.899]  What we do is cease to cooperate with it.
[02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:27.241]  And one way we cooperate with it is the fight.
[02:08:27.321 --> 02:08:36.324]  So if you've got an electrical circuit, you need two polarities, and the electrical charge goes between them.
[02:08:37.156 --> 02:08:54.793]  So, when you refuse to take part, then that force which wants to set up an electrical interaction with you, so it vampires your energy, suddenly it's one hand clapping.
[02:08:54.833 --> 02:08:59.037]  It's got no way of setting up that connection because you're not having it.
[02:08:59.775 --> 02:09:01.098]  You don't want to fight it.
[02:09:01.659 --> 02:09:03.503]  What you want to do is cease to cooperate with it.
[02:09:04.004 --> 02:09:09.825]   And that's why the power of no is so fundamental.
[02:09:09.845 --> 02:09:12.206]  The power of no has ended every tyranny in history.
[02:09:13.127 --> 02:09:18.148]  The power of no says, I can see what you're doing.
[02:09:18.168 --> 02:09:19.949]  I can see why you're doing it.
[02:09:20.369 --> 02:09:22.670]  And I'm not playing your game.
[02:09:22.750 --> 02:09:24.870]  I'm not being a pawn in your game.
[02:09:24.950 --> 02:09:25.750]  I'm not having it.
[02:09:26.191 --> 02:09:43.694]   So if you look at the COVID period, If people had said no to house arrest, so-called lockdown, better said no to social distancing, no to masks, none of that could have been enforced.
[02:09:47.182 --> 02:09:52.505]  The fact that people did submit in Australia and the UK and the US to some extent, but they woke up, now the pendulum's swinging back.
[02:09:52.525 --> 02:09:57.869]  1% of who was taking the Pfizer-Moderna shots, according to a study that came out last month, are taking it now.
[02:09:58.409 --> 02:10:00.431]  So people are really rejecting it en masse.
[02:10:00.471 --> 02:10:01.671]  It takes people a while.
[02:10:02.072 --> 02:10:04.333]  Yes, you're vindicated, I'm vindicated, our viewers and listeners are.
[02:10:04.393 --> 02:10:08.396]  Those rallies you have with hundreds of thousands, the rallies Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[02:10:08.416 --> 02:10:12.779]  had with millions, I see this as an awakening, but you're right, now they're coming for the kids.
[02:10:13.199 --> 02:10:27.282]   I want to speak to that, but since you talk about Here's Julian Assange, now many years ago, before he got arrested or put on house arrest, explaining the goal of these wars, like Vietnam or Ukraine, is to be endless.
[02:10:27.322 --> 02:10:27.662]  Here it is.
[02:10:29.554 --> 02:10:33.475]  Because the goal is not to completely subjugate Afghanistan.
[02:10:33.955 --> 02:10:48.660]  The goal is to use Afghanistan to wash money out of the tax bases of the United States, out of the tax bases of European countries, through Afghanistan, and back into the hands of a transnational security alliance.
[02:10:48.920 --> 02:10:51.121]  That is the goal, i.e.
[02:10:51.141 --> 02:10:55.442]  the goal is to have an endless war, not a successful war.
[02:10:56.513 --> 02:10:57.213]  But it's bigger than that.
[02:10:57.734 --> 02:10:59.194]  It's energetic at the end of the day.
[02:10:59.354 --> 02:11:03.496]  So, David, spend a few minutes just on the temporal level of this dimension for us.
[02:11:03.876 --> 02:11:19.062]  We know you're really teaching us a lot here, but specifically, the last two and a half years of hell, the euthanizing people here and in your country, the lockdowns, the police dogs, the people being put in jail, the quarantines, that helped build their emergency infrastructure that's still there.
[02:11:19.102 --> 02:11:20.303]  We know they're going to come back soon.
[02:11:20.723 --> 02:11:28.147]   I want your take on how that happens, but it does look like They wanted to keep lockdowns going longer, control longer, and that there was a massive rejection.
[02:11:28.467 --> 02:11:36.292]  So when they saw the crescendo of resistance building that would have been a chain reaction to take us over the top, they backed off at least for a little while.
[02:11:36.713 --> 02:11:50.361]   So your description of Coming out that you're way more likely in studies to die of COVID or get COVID if you have the shot, that it doesn't work, that it erases your immune system, that it is confirmed to be building some type of nanotech matrix in people.
[02:11:50.441 --> 02:11:52.402]  I mean, this is part of something big.
[02:11:52.782 --> 02:11:53.323]  What is it?
[02:11:53.703 --> 02:11:54.383]  How did it go?
[02:11:54.664 --> 02:11:56.625]  And what do you see them getting ready to hit us with next?
[02:11:58.606 --> 02:12:05.790]  Well, what they're doing, Alex, is going through their agenda for the human body.
[02:12:06.611 --> 02:12:08.392]  Like I said, it's an anti-human agenda.
[02:12:09.358 --> 02:12:19.998]  And they're moving from human 1.0, the biological body as we call it, to human 2.0, which is a far more synthetic body.
[02:12:20.737 --> 02:12:23.639]  And this was described by Aldous Huxley in Brave New World.
[02:12:24.279 --> 02:12:29.342]  And this new human is not meant to procreate.
[02:12:29.482 --> 02:12:35.726]  It's meant to be produced technologically, which is what Huxley was talking about in World State Hatcheries.
[02:12:36.547 --> 02:12:48.674]  And he said that with the World State Hatcheries and the production of the human species via technology, that would be the end of parenthood.
[02:12:49.312 --> 02:12:53.976]  So from that comes an enormous number of dots to connect.
[02:12:54.776 --> 02:12:56.377]  First of all, the end of parenthood.
[02:12:56.417 --> 02:13:12.029]  That's why in Europe and America, Canada and so on, you're seeing the influence and ability to make decisions by parents about their children being completely and utterly erased.
[02:13:13.566 --> 02:13:15.127]  Why are they doing that?
[02:13:15.767 --> 02:13:21.390]  Because they're preparing for this no parent society.
[02:13:21.990 --> 02:13:28.453]  Now, if you don't need parents to procreate, you don't need men and you don't need women.
[02:13:29.213 --> 02:13:42.615]  And so we had the toxic masculinity agenda where men started to be and continue to be abused and marginalized and attacked.
[02:13:43.155 --> 02:13:53.677]  And I said when that started, Alex, they're coming for the women next because they don't need men and women in this brave new world of the human 2.0 to procreate.
[02:13:53.837 --> 02:13:58.859]   And so They're now going for the women.
[02:13:59.499 --> 02:14:09.743]  And the dominant force now in the hierarchy of political correctness is transgender.
[02:14:10.303 --> 02:14:12.884]  So where does transgender come from?
[02:14:12.944 --> 02:14:15.745]  Why did it come out of nowhere and it was suddenly everywhere?
[02:14:16.686 --> 02:14:25.289]  Why are they targeting the children in this extraordinarily extreme, blatant, in-your-face manner with the drag queens and so on?
[02:14:26.226 --> 02:14:41.375]  They're doing it because on the road to fusing gender, because this new human is meant not to be male or female, there's no need for it to be because you are not procreating anymore.
[02:14:42.736 --> 02:14:48.119]  You have to, on the way to fusing gender, you have to confuse gender.
[02:14:48.519 --> 02:14:55.700]   You have to take out the basics in the perception of the population of what gender is.
[02:14:56.480 --> 02:14:57.620]  Not male, female.
[02:14:57.640 --> 02:14:59.921]  You have to scramble that whole perception.
[02:15:00.602 --> 02:15:17.328]  And they are doing these horrific things to children, both perceptually and literally, with the surgery and the drugs and the castration of young kids, on the road to totally scrambling the perception of gender on the road to the no-gender human.
[02:15:17.368 --> 02:15:25.272]   And the no-gender human, as Huxley described, Would be produced in casts.
[02:15:25.953 --> 02:15:36.880]  And these casts would be genetic casts, actually synthetic genetic casts, which would have different abilities.
[02:15:36.920 --> 02:15:38.481]  We come back to what we're talking about earlier.
[02:15:38.901 --> 02:15:46.826]  They'd have different abilities to process information into a perception, into a conclusion, into a actional behavior.
[02:15:47.226 --> 02:15:56.027]   So the worker caste would be unable to process information, thus understand
[02:15:56.027 --> 02:16:02.266]   any information beyond their ability to serve as the worker caste.
[02:16:02.266 --> 02:16:04.827]  And to back you up, Huxley wrote that in '31.
[02:16:04.578 --> 02:16:07.600]  His brother was a head transhumanist, ran the UN.
[02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:12.864]  He said in a speech in 61 and his book Brave New World Revisited that this was an actual plan of the elites.
[02:16:12.904 --> 02:16:17.987]  And as you know, he was part of that British breeding program, eugenics program himself.
[02:16:19.332 --> 02:16:34.876]  Yeah, I mean, his brother was a eugenicist, I mean, quite obviously, and of course he would be involved in the UN, which is a front for this cult to justify and to stepping stone towards.
[02:16:36.998 --> 02:16:43.086]  So these really are just human-alien collaborators with a center-dimensional force.
[02:16:43.147 --> 02:16:44.729]  I mean, the Bible tells us that everything.
[02:16:45.009 --> 02:16:45.630]  This is really it.
[02:16:45.650 --> 02:16:47.733]  They're building a post-human world, building a nightmare.
[02:16:48.013 --> 02:16:49.355]  They see us as lab rats, David.
[02:16:49.375 --> 02:16:50.136]  You've been vindicated.
[02:16:51.144 --> 02:17:12.841]   Well, again, what I find interesting, or what I've found interesting over the years as I've researched this, Alex, is that, you know, we look at the different religions and so on, and what strikes me is not how the religions differ from each other, But actually the common themes.
[02:17:13.582 --> 02:17:16.524]  So I looked at the Christian belief in demons.
[02:17:17.364 --> 02:17:23.348]  I looked at the whole, you know, demonic realm as Christians describe it.
[02:17:23.949 --> 02:17:25.950]  I looked at Islam and the jinn.
[02:17:26.030 --> 02:17:26.950]  What are the jinn?
[02:17:26.991 --> 02:17:31.373]  They're entities that operate outside of human sight, manipulating human society.
[02:17:31.994 --> 02:17:40.139]  I looked at the Gnostics, which were a kind of vaguely a form of Christianity in theme, if not detail.
[02:17:41.167 --> 02:17:45.592]  And they talked about archons in the writings that they left.
[02:17:45.672 --> 02:17:53.721]  There was one amazing group of writings by Gnostics that were found in an earthen jar in Egypt.
[02:17:53.781 --> 02:17:57.185]  These were mystic Christians that formed the basis of the Renaissance?
[02:17:57.907 --> 02:18:05.433]  Yeah, and they left these writings, very substantial writings, in an earthen jar.
[02:18:06.013 --> 02:18:15.120]  It's estimated that they were hidden away about 75 miles north of Luxor in Egypt, a place called Nag Hammadi, about 400 AD.
[02:18:17.191 --> 02:18:24.899]  And about a fifth of these writings, after they were found in 1945, were found to be about these Archons.
[02:18:25.039 --> 02:18:27.021]  Now, well, hold on a second.
[02:18:27.241 --> 02:18:28.102]  What do they say?
[02:18:28.622 --> 02:18:33.507]  They called them Archons because Archon is a Greek word meaning rulers.
[02:18:34.348 --> 02:18:40.454]  They said that these Archons created what we call the physical world.
[02:18:41.684 --> 02:18:47.789]  And that this was a bad copy of prime reality.
[02:18:49.090 --> 02:19:03.041]   They also talked about the fact that the great ability of these Archons was virtual reality, what we would, in the translation, what we
[02:19:03.041 --> 02:19:09.821]   would call today virtual reality, the ability to manipulate and generate illusions that made
[02:19:09.821 --> 02:19:15.380]   people believe they were somewhere was not anything like where they thought they were or what they
[02:19:15.380 --> 02:19:25.681]   thought it was. And then you go to the Zulus in South Africa, and they have the concept of the Chittahuri.
[02:19:25.898 --> 02:19:42.369]  And wherever you go, I've talked to aboriginals in Australia as I've traveled around the world, and you see these common, common themes of entities operating outside of human sight, which is not saying much given how narrow human sight is.
[02:19:42.929 --> 02:19:45.551]  And they're always trying to drag us into their dimension.
[02:19:46.872 --> 02:19:47.212]  Yeah.
[02:19:50.081 --> 02:19:57.003]  If we could think of mind, say fourth dimension or astral dimension is the dimension of mind, okay?
[02:19:57.523 --> 02:20:15.388]  Now you can be at the higher levels of it and see things and understand things with your mind that people in these lower levels of the astral dimension, where these entities are, cannot see.
[02:20:17.588 --> 02:20:24.173]  You're much more expansive in your understanding, in your ability to see the greater picture.
[02:20:24.673 --> 02:20:29.136]  You go beyond that too, way beyond that, but you're seeing a much bigger picture.
[02:20:30.257 --> 02:20:44.445]   Whereas in the lower dimensions of this, lower levels of this astral dimension, This is where these entities are, what are called Archons and Demons and all these different names for the same entities.
[02:20:44.965 --> 02:20:48.487]  The Gods, as the ancients would perceive them.
[02:20:49.368 --> 02:20:55.230]  And so they are dominating that area of this astral dimension.
[02:20:55.651 --> 02:21:04.275]  So they want your mind, the frequency of your mind, thoughts, perceptions, to be in that level.
[02:21:05.255 --> 02:21:20.283]  David, I want to get your take on how people can break out of that, but I want to play this clip.
[02:21:20.303 --> 02:21:24.466]  You talk about Stockholm Syndrome in your previous books and how they mind control people.
[02:21:24.486 --> 02:21:30.749]  This is Jennifer Gibson, well-known actress who took one of the poison shots and now has Bell's palsy.
[02:21:30.769 --> 02:21:37.909]   She says she'd do it again, and I find one of the prime things that these people that are under this control
[02:21:37.909 --> 02:21:41.790]   basically want to destroy themselves and don't care that they're being hurt by the system.
[02:21:41.790 --> 02:21:46.070]   How would we break somebody, or how could she break herself out,
[02:21:46.070 --> 02:21:47.869]  Jennifer Gibson, out of these things grasped?
[02:21:47.869 --> 02:21:49.029]  Here's a clip.
[02:21:49.029 --> 02:21:53.930]  Well, this is not a video I want to make.
[02:21:53.930 --> 02:21:59.310]   And it's kind of hard to make 'cause as I'm watching myself,
[02:21:59.310 --> 02:22:07.189]   I see what I'm gonna say, which is I have been diagnosed with Bell's palsy,
[02:22:07.189 --> 02:22:09.430]  which is paralysis on one side of the face.
[02:22:09.561 --> 02:22:12.623]  For me, it's this side here, the left, obviously.
[02:22:15.732 --> 02:22:21.817]  So I got it about two weeks after getting my vaccine and I had a rough go with the vaccine.
[02:22:21.837 --> 02:22:33.888]  Um, and I guess still am, but I have to say that I would do it again because it's what we have to do to see people.
[02:22:33.928 --> 02:22:38.992]  So, um, I don't know why I'm making this video, but here's my word smile.
[02:22:40.515 --> 02:22:41.956]  It's what we have to do to save people.
[02:22:41.996 --> 02:22:43.116]  She believes she's a hero.
[02:22:43.616 --> 02:22:45.557]  Can't look at the statistics, can't know the facts for herself.
[02:22:45.897 --> 02:22:47.398]  What is going on with this woman, David Icke?
[02:22:48.339 --> 02:22:55.662]  Well, you see, what you've got here, and we can talk about the fake vaccine as well, and its effect on the psyche of people.
[02:22:56.342 --> 02:23:02.985]  I mean, the number of people, I mean, we all interact with people, we both interact with people a lot, and we both read a lot.
[02:23:03.045 --> 02:23:08.528]  Almost everyone I know that's taken it has less energy, is sick now, and acts more zombie-like.
[02:23:08.568 --> 02:23:09.128]  It's very sad.
[02:23:09.864 --> 02:23:23.182]  Well, I'll tell you the word, Alex, that I've heard so many times in relation to people who've had loved ones or people who they work with who've had the fake vaccine when they haven't.
[02:23:24.526 --> 02:23:25.427]  It's vacant.
[02:23:26.127 --> 02:23:27.469]  These people are vacant.
[02:23:28.310 --> 02:23:39.722]  And it's basically, we have what people call a soul, which is experiencing this reality through the human body.
[02:23:40.282 --> 02:23:46.569]  And that soul is supposed to connect out into the great beyond and the great expansion of awareness, insight, knowledge, all that stuff.
[02:23:47.153 --> 02:23:53.955]  The idea of these fake vaccines, one level of them, there are many reasons for them, is to break that connection.
[02:23:54.475 --> 02:24:04.117]  So that basically, if I'm sitting here in front of a computer, and I'm the soul, I'm interacting with the computer.
[02:24:04.477 --> 02:24:07.758]  I've got the mouse, I've got the keyboard, I'm interacting with it.
[02:24:09.002 --> 02:24:18.185]  But when you get a computer virus, which is essentially in theme, is what these fake vaccines are doing.
[02:24:19.444 --> 02:24:33.194]  That computer virus takes over the operating system and it disconnects the interaction between me, symbolic of soul, and the operating system, symbolic of the body.
[02:24:33.714 --> 02:24:52.248]   So now the five sense level of the person is running the show and it's been literally possessed by By another force, by being disconnected from its source, what we call the soul.
[02:24:52.348 --> 02:24:57.212]  So with this lady, something has happened physically.
[02:24:57.512 --> 02:25:01.055]  It's happened in the five sense realm of her life.
[02:25:01.536 --> 02:25:05.659]  Therefore, she cannot ignore it.
[02:25:06.039 --> 02:25:07.040]  She can't ignore it.
[02:25:07.380 --> 02:25:09.682]  Her five senses are seeing it.
[02:25:09.802 --> 02:25:11.244]  They're experiencing it.
[02:25:11.564 --> 02:25:13.946]  So that level can't be hidden from her.
[02:25:14.466 --> 02:25:21.230]  But what can be manipulated is her response to it, which comes from perception.
[02:25:22.291 --> 02:25:40.284]   And her perception is that even though I can't ignore it, look at it, what this fake vaccine has done to me, My response is still, well, I'd have it again, which is insane, but that's the way the program works.
[02:25:40.344 --> 02:25:55.235]   Now, if you were connected to what people call soul, if your mind was more expansive, as with all the people who have not had the fake facts, They would say, bloody hell, have you seen what this thing's done to me?
[02:25:55.275 --> 02:25:58.917]  Of course I'd never have it again, and no one should have it.
[02:25:58.977 --> 02:26:13.984]  That's what you would say if you had any kind of expansive mind, but these people do not, and therefore they cannot, coming back to what I said earlier, Alex, they literally cannot process the information.
[02:26:14.004 --> 02:26:15.805]  Absolutely, so how do you get her out of the trance?
[02:26:18.956 --> 02:26:21.377]  I mean, how do we help these people, or are they just lost causes?
[02:26:23.898 --> 02:26:30.841]  Well, as I say earlier in our chat, everything is mind.
[02:26:31.561 --> 02:26:32.441]  Everything is mind.
[02:26:33.502 --> 02:26:44.046]  This force is manipulating mind to perceive and conclude in a way that suits its agenda.
[02:26:44.847 --> 02:26:54.732]  But mind, consciousness beyond mind into the great beyond, what people call spirit, is capable of overriding that.
[02:26:55.773 --> 02:27:03.397]  You know, I've said in The Trap that the mind is not in the body.
[02:27:04.438 --> 02:27:06.058]  The body is in the mind.
[02:27:07.759 --> 02:27:14.717]   Mind is generating or decoding The information into what we call the body.
[02:27:15.657 --> 02:27:47.676]   Now, once the mind is manipulated to believe it's in the body, and the body systems are the dominant force in the relationship, then when a doctor says to someone, you've got five months to live, if you look at the statistics, you'll see that the doctor's prognosis for life Turns out to be overwhelmingly the period that people live before they die.
[02:27:47.696 --> 02:27:50.419]  Now is that because doctors are so clever?
[02:27:50.519 --> 02:27:52.961]  No, no, are you bloody kidding?
[02:27:53.702 --> 02:28:02.682]   It's because the mind takes on the belief That it has five months to live and that's what it creates.
[02:28:02.762 --> 02:28:04.002]  A reverse placebo.
[02:28:04.162 --> 02:28:05.243]  Psychosomatic.
[02:28:05.483 --> 02:28:05.883]  Incredible.
[02:28:05.983 --> 02:28:07.744]  And I understand the technicals of what you're saying.
[02:28:07.764 --> 02:28:08.265]  You're totally right.
[02:28:08.285 --> 02:28:11.547]  I'm asking if you had five minutes to talk to this woman on a park bench.
[02:28:12.621 --> 02:28:27.853]  Just, what would David Icke, just not as a philosopher, not as a best-selling author, not as a researcher, not as a trailblazer, a maverick, but just as a man, if she was saying this to you, how, is there any tricks to get her to realize she can override the control, she can get back in control?
[02:28:28.334 --> 02:28:31.957]  Like, look at you, I mean, what have they done to you, sweetheart?
[02:28:31.997 --> 02:28:35.980]  Do you give her statistics, or is there some way to get her out of the Stockholm Syndrome?
[02:28:37.898 --> 02:28:48.065]  Well, in the end, you know, it's information that creates the program, that programs people into that state of mind.
[02:28:48.605 --> 02:28:51.868]  And therefore, it's information that can deprogram.
[02:28:51.888 --> 02:28:55.530]  So people need to flood her Twitter and Instagram with this interview today.
[02:28:55.550 --> 02:28:58.612]  She needs outreach.
[02:29:00.093 --> 02:29:06.258]  Yeah, what I would say to her is, first of all, look at this level.
[02:29:07.228 --> 02:29:25.472]   And look at the fact that you've taken a fake vaccine, which is not a vaccine by any previous criteria, and you've got into this state Now, why would you then say you'd have it again, given what it's done to you?
[02:29:26.152 --> 02:29:43.379]  I would then show her all the other people across the world, just going by the VAERS system in America and the Yellow Card system of reporting in Britain, which is only between 1% and 10% maximum, of their actual deaths and adverse effects.
[02:29:44.139 --> 02:30:00.454]  And I would point out that the consequences, not just for her, it's not just a one-off, are absolutely massive both in deaths and in destroyed health long term and reduced life expectancy.
[02:30:01.351 --> 02:30:10.558]  And then I'd ask her if she really believed that someone who would promote that had the best interests of humanity at heart.
[02:30:10.658 --> 02:30:17.763]  I would show her all the kids' figures who've died by having this fake vaccine.
[02:30:17.983 --> 02:30:22.106]  Because the question comes, why do they want to give this fake vaccine?
[02:30:24.608 --> 02:30:35.894]  The ones that follow to every man, woman, and child on the planet, because they want every man, woman, and child on the planet connected to the cloud and controlled by AI so they don't even have to manipulate perception anymore.
[02:30:36.554 --> 02:30:37.515]  It comes direct from AI.
[02:30:38.536 --> 02:30:39.616]  That's the whole point.
[02:30:40.577 --> 02:30:44.139]  And then I would start to ask her, who do you think you are?
[02:30:45.119 --> 02:30:46.500]  Do you think you're just that body?
[02:30:46.520 --> 02:30:50.482]  And I go deeper into the nature of reality.
[02:30:50.502 --> 02:31:05.224]   And the only way you can You can get people out of the program is for them to expand their minds into greater swathes of consciousness beyond the program.
[02:31:05.664 --> 02:31:08.266]  And this is what, Alex, we call awakening.
[02:31:09.346 --> 02:31:10.526]  What is awakening?
[02:31:10.707 --> 02:31:13.848]  It's awakening from the five sense prison.
[02:31:14.488 --> 02:31:30.934]  The whole process of human control is focusing attention on the smallest myopia of possibility, of self-identity, of reality.
[02:31:34.119 --> 02:31:50.318]  If people can start to ask questions, that's the process, asking questions of what they've been told, and they'll realize, if they do any research at all, or read other people's research, they'll see that what they're told overwhelmingly is wrong.
[02:31:50.358 --> 02:31:50.698]  Absolutely.
[02:31:51.039 --> 02:31:52.280]  Well, David, you have been so...
[02:31:54.406 --> 02:31:55.087]  Lies!
[02:31:55.427 --> 02:32:08.040]  So when authority tells you something, whether it's a fake vaccine or the reason for a war, what you say is, okay, on the basis of the entirety of known human history, authority lies.
[02:32:08.100 --> 02:32:22.229]   So I'm going to start on the basis that what you're telling me is a bloody lie, like the Gas pipeline this week and you've got to convince me with evidence that this time you're not lying and they never will because they're always bloody lying.
[02:32:22.789 --> 02:32:28.631]  So awakening is and what you're doing when you're awakening what's the process?
[02:32:29.131 --> 02:32:34.273]  You're opening your mind to other possibilities.
[02:32:35.334 --> 02:32:45.998]  Once you start that process, what are the other possibilities of what is happening or other possibilities of the reality I'm experiencing?
[02:32:46.359 --> 02:32:49.540]  That questioning starts to open your mind.
[02:32:49.580 --> 02:32:49.880]  Beautiful.
[02:32:49.980 --> 02:32:52.841]  And you start to see things you couldn't see before.
[02:32:53.382 --> 02:33:02.107]   And there's a real process and So many people watching this program, this chat, will have gone through this, otherwise they wouldn't be watching this.
[02:33:03.268 --> 02:33:06.770]  There's this process known as synchronicity.
[02:33:07.890 --> 02:33:20.993]  Which Jung talked about, the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, synchronicity, where things just happen and you think, what's the chances of that?
[02:33:21.173 --> 02:33:22.454]  What a coincidence!
[02:33:22.614 --> 02:33:24.114]  Blimey, how did that happen?
[02:33:24.574 --> 02:33:50.738]   And what it is, is this, when you are operating on a certain perceptual state, That frequency that's going out, that is a frequency reflection of the perceptual state, is pulling towards you other frequencies, other magnetic fields, called people, places, ways of life, experiences, that relate to that original perception.
[02:33:51.118 --> 02:34:09.982]   So if you are, if your perceptions are only coming from mainstream media, the mainstream everything, Then what you will do will experience things that seem to confirm that what you're told by the mainstream everything is true, because that's all you're experiencing.
[02:34:10.742 --> 02:34:16.286]  But when you start to open your mind and say, well, hold on, what's some other explanations for this?
[02:34:16.326 --> 02:34:18.288]  What's the other possible explanation for this?
[02:34:19.148 --> 02:34:25.694]  That changes the frequency you're putting out because you're expanding, opening your mind to ask those questions.
[02:34:26.194 --> 02:34:46.670]   And what then happens is you start attracting to you, and it's a frequency attraction of electromagnetic fields on this level, people, places, ways of life, experiences, coincidences, That's right.
[02:34:47.350 --> 02:34:55.255]  And let's be clear, that's why the Satanists and people do the evil acts is to open up that interdimensional connection to get deeper into that.
[02:34:55.675 --> 02:34:59.498]  The other side gets the energy, others get to get deeper into that, they get information from it.
[02:35:00.018 --> 02:35:05.644]  But when you're going with God or the light or your open freedom, then it's not a centralized thing.
[02:35:05.665 --> 02:35:08.828]  It's open, it's free, and the universe just expands.
[02:35:08.868 --> 02:35:10.390]  David Icke, incredible interview.
[02:35:10.490 --> 02:35:17.738]  I know you've got to go on this Emergency Saturday Show, but I had a few just basic questions, quick answers for what's currently happening in the world.
[02:35:18.777 --> 02:35:19.758]  What's your big picture?
[02:35:19.819 --> 02:35:23.143]  Is Putin really working with the globalists, or is he in a real fight with them?
[02:35:23.243 --> 02:35:26.508]  I think there's a real fight going on, but I think there's groups playing off both sides.
[02:35:26.528 --> 02:35:27.970]  What do you think about the gas pipeline?
[02:35:28.450 --> 02:35:31.054]  What do you think about all the major escalations we're seeing there?
[02:35:31.394 --> 02:35:35.300]  The global digital currency, just all these big, huge events we see unfolding.
[02:35:37.611 --> 02:35:43.897]  Well, I said when they played the COVID card that they've entered the room now and they've heard the door click behind them.
[02:35:44.437 --> 02:35:53.297]   Because if you're setting out, Alex, to transform global society, You can work under the radar for a certain amount of time.
[02:35:53.738 --> 02:35:58.480]  And, you know, we've been pointing out over the years, over the decades, that this is what the plan is.
[02:35:58.900 --> 02:36:07.224]  But because it wasn't impacting blatantly and obviously on people's lives, it was done more subtly than it has been since the COVID era.
[02:36:08.044 --> 02:36:09.625]  It's all dismissed.
[02:36:09.725 --> 02:36:11.006]  Oh, that's a load of nonsense.
[02:36:11.106 --> 02:36:13.707]  Only the awakening people saw it then.
[02:36:16.454 --> 02:36:24.503]  But if you are going to transform human society in the image that you want, there comes a time when you have to actually do it.
[02:36:24.903 --> 02:36:29.188]  And society transforms in a way that people can see it.
[02:36:29.268 --> 02:36:31.050]  And let me just interrupt you because that's so important.
[02:36:31.290 --> 02:36:37.277]  I remember 15 years ago on my show, it was 15 years ago, we just moved these studios, and you sent in a lot of shows to me after then.
[02:36:37.937 --> 02:36:40.399]  But we ought to try to find that tape because it goes so viral.
[02:36:40.420 --> 02:36:43.062]  People really wake up seeing how long ago you and I and others.
[02:36:43.482 --> 02:36:43.883]  Ridiculous.
[02:36:43.903 --> 02:36:50.669]  You said, I, from my study, see in the year 2016 a global awakening and a big push against the New World Order.
[02:36:51.249 --> 02:36:54.352]  But then that will force them to counter-strike in around the year 2000.
[02:36:55.573 --> 02:37:00.515]  And if we haven't beaten them by 2025, the world's going to get progressively worse, but we could turn it around in 2025.
[02:37:01.615 --> 02:37:04.576]  Well, now we're 70% through your predictions.
[02:37:04.636 --> 02:37:07.377]  It's happening exactly like you said you were on a couple years ago.
[02:37:07.417 --> 02:37:08.358]  I said, how did you do that?
[02:37:08.378 --> 02:37:10.779]  And you just said, you know, opening up to the universe.
[02:37:10.839 --> 02:37:17.121]  So can you briefly speak to that and then give us your forward projection into the future again as a literal time traveler?
[02:37:18.743 --> 02:37:21.024]  Yeah, it's hoping it's not beyond the universe, actually.
[02:37:21.204 --> 02:37:23.585]  The universe is, in my view, the simulation.
[02:37:23.625 --> 02:37:41.191]  But yeah, if you open your mind and let it connect with expanded states of consciousness, not some spaceship or some alien, but actually the consciousness that you are.
[02:37:41.271 --> 02:37:55.517]   Because it's one thing to mention here, you know, Just because people use different names doesn't mean they are not relatively on the same page.
[02:37:56.397 --> 02:38:02.763]  So, I talk about an infinite consciousness that I call the All That Is.
[02:38:02.843 --> 02:38:04.905]  The All That Is, Has Been and Ever Can Be.
[02:38:06.486 --> 02:38:08.388]  And others talk about God.
[02:38:09.799 --> 02:38:12.360]  And others call God different names.
[02:38:12.500 --> 02:38:16.801]  But, you know, a lot of the so-called gods are actually these entities.
[02:38:16.901 --> 02:38:26.164]  But if you look at the bigger picture of what people call God and the way they see it, then, you know, we're not a million miles away from each other.
[02:38:26.644 --> 02:38:29.425]  It's just that we use different language and have a different perception.
[02:38:29.525 --> 02:38:38.087]  And what we can all unify behind is, whatever our cosmology or understanding of it is, we know it's real, we know these evil forces are trying to cut us off from that bigger.
[02:38:39.195 --> 02:38:40.155]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:38:40.536 --> 02:38:53.181]  Because, you know, once you open your mind and start to connect with expanded levels of consciousness that are at levels of frequency beyond the realm of influence of these entities.
[02:38:53.341 --> 02:38:56.702]  Sure, and David, you said this a year and a half ago, but I find you so fascinating.
[02:38:57.323 --> 02:39:01.863]   specifically give us more than how you come on a show and your predictions never turn
[02:39:01.863 --> 02:39:05.702]   out to be wrong and you say in 2016 there will be a global awakening in Europe, the
[02:39:05.702 --> 02:39:07.222]  US, and Latin America, other areas.
[02:39:07.222 --> 02:39:11.742]   There will be a big push against the globalists and in 2020 they will launch their counter-assault
[02:39:11.742 --> 02:39:16.022]   and if we haven't turned them around by 2025 it's going to be hell on earth but we could
[02:39:16.022 --> 02:39:20.563]   defeat them then and by 2030, which they now admit is their end date to beat us, we could
[02:39:20.563 --> 02:39:21.563]  beat them.
[02:39:21.563 --> 02:39:24.541]  How in the – I mean is it just an imprint you get?
[02:39:24.541 --> 02:39:27.583]   Because I have similar things happen to me that I know are right and are going to be
[02:39:27.583 --> 02:39:28.583]  right.
[02:39:28.583 --> 02:39:31.702]  Or was it specifics or I mean are you talking to the watchers?
[02:39:31.702 --> 02:39:33.023]  I mean what's going on here?
[02:39:33.023 --> 02:39:42.782]   Well, if I go back to when I had my awakening, I was a television presenter and what have
[02:39:42.782 --> 02:39:47.382]  you and in 1990 and '91 and the top of my head blew up.
[02:39:48.332 --> 02:40:02.900]   And what happened in the spring of 1990, after I'd had a year up to that point, where It progressively got more and more tangible that when I was in a room alone, I wasn't alone.
[02:40:03.921 --> 02:40:09.222]  And through, what would it be, 1989, it got stronger and stronger until the spring of 1990.
[02:40:09.362 --> 02:40:17.204]  And I was sitting in a hotel room working for the BBC, a place called the Kensington Hilton, just down from Television Centre in London.
[02:40:18.237 --> 02:40:30.304]  And this presence in the room was so massive and obvious that I sat on the side of the bed and I said, if there's something there, would you please contact me because you'll drive me up the wall.
[02:40:30.744 --> 02:40:41.209]  Long story short, within a few days, I found myself in a, maybe a week, 10 days, I found myself in the front room of a professional psychic.
[02:40:41.269 --> 02:40:42.210]  I'd never seen one before.
[02:40:43.154 --> 02:40:50.239]  Who goes into psychic mode and says, um, I'm being told that you're going to go out on a world stage and reveal great secrets.
[02:40:50.339 --> 02:40:51.240]  Now, this is 1990.
[02:40:53.321 --> 02:40:53.601]  What?
[02:40:54.542 --> 02:41:09.953]  Uh, and, but the reason I tell that story is because what came through that day, this lady stood up, this entity that I'm seeing is telling me this, is that from this moment, we're going to lead you to knowledge.
[02:41:10.834 --> 02:41:15.055]  And at other times, we'll put knowledge directly into your mind.
[02:41:16.096 --> 02:41:20.057]  And over the last 32 years, that's exactly what has happened.
[02:41:20.597 --> 02:41:26.259]  I mean, you know, you know, you would have experienced... Oh, that happens to me all the time, where first I'll feel this really big presence.
[02:41:26.299 --> 02:41:28.920]  It happened about six months ago, laying in bed at like 10 at night.
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:29.900]  I felt the big presence.
[02:41:30.380 --> 02:41:32.081]  And then I said, OK, give me the info.
[02:41:32.161 --> 02:41:35.562]  And then I woke up the next day and literally knew all this stuff was about to happen again.
[02:41:35.582 --> 02:41:36.202]  It was just there.
[02:41:37.307 --> 02:41:46.229]  Yeah, because what's happening is people who go into that mode are tuning in, and it's about opening your mind.
[02:41:46.289 --> 02:41:49.770]  If you've got a closed mind and you're five-sense-centric, you're not going to make it.
[02:41:49.790 --> 02:41:51.030]  Well, there's also a free will aspect.
[02:41:51.070 --> 02:41:54.891]  As you talk about it, call it an angel, what you will, there's this powerful force, you know it's there.
[02:41:55.431 --> 02:41:57.491]  If it's evil, you feel the back of your neck crawl.
[02:41:57.531 --> 02:42:01.172]  This is just like calm, focus, contentment, completion.
[02:42:01.912 --> 02:42:03.452]  But then it's like, okay, you want this?
[02:42:03.512 --> 02:42:04.512]  Because it never forces it.
[02:42:04.532 --> 02:42:05.153]  Like, you want this?
[02:42:05.933 --> 02:42:06.833]  Is that what you're describing?
[02:42:07.717 --> 02:42:31.437]   Yeah, you know, the challenge for those that tune into this stuff and get this download, it's literally a download, it's like a computer download, is to not be intimidated Into keeping it to yourself, because you think, what will people think of me?
[02:42:31.938 --> 02:42:47.886]   So when I started getting this stuff about this non-human element to all this, and the reptilian element and all that, Most people, frankly, would have said, well, hold on a minute, mate.
[02:42:49.426 --> 02:42:52.947]  Can you imagine what they're going to say when I come out with this?
[02:42:53.287 --> 02:42:54.387]  No way, fella.
[02:42:54.928 --> 02:43:00.409]  So the challenge is, look, I'm not interested in a statue and a round of applause.
[02:43:00.449 --> 02:43:01.669]  I'm interested in the truth.
[02:43:02.089 --> 02:43:06.550]  I'm interested in human freedom from this tyranny.
[02:43:08.630 --> 02:43:18.401]  If I, if it crosses my line, in terms of, I can justify this to myself and by then I could, I'm coming out with it.
[02:43:19.242 --> 02:43:24.708]  And the consequences for me of doing that, well, they'll just have to happen because I'm doing it anyway.
[02:43:24.748 --> 02:43:25.629]  That's the challenge.
[02:43:26.690 --> 02:43:32.790]   And a lot of people will have had these perceptions, maybe, and they've kept them to themselves
[02:43:32.790 --> 02:43:35.869]  'cause they fear the consequences of talking about it.
[02:43:35.869 --> 02:43:36.709]  David, I gotta know more.
[02:43:36.709 --> 02:43:38.109]  This is so fascinating.
[02:43:38.109 --> 02:43:41.510]   You said you go in your bedroom, you feel this incredible presence, you can't ignore it.
[02:43:41.510 --> 02:43:43.630]  It's like you're not having a bad day, a good day.
[02:43:43.630 --> 02:43:46.630]   You're talking, all of a sudden you walk through, and you're like, "Whoa, it's only happened to me
[02:43:46.630 --> 02:43:48.029]  "maybe 10 times in my life."
[02:43:47.874 --> 02:43:51.356]  It's like, whoa, I really, there's something here.
[02:43:51.997 --> 02:43:52.437]  Okay.
[02:43:52.857 --> 02:43:54.659]  And then it's like, do you want this information?
[02:43:54.679 --> 02:43:57.801]  That when I was a child, teenager, it's happened to some of you since I was an adult.
[02:43:58.061 --> 02:43:59.122]  You never know what's going to happen.
[02:43:59.843 --> 02:44:01.564]  Usually it's when you're in some quiet place alone.
[02:44:02.224 --> 02:44:03.025]  What was the feeling?
[02:44:03.045 --> 02:44:04.026]  You said it was so intense.
[02:44:06.308 --> 02:44:26.666]  Well, lots of things happened to me in the early 90s, especially on a mound, a hill in Peru, a place called Si Ustani in Peru, which was an energetic input, which had me shaking like I was plugged into the mains for about 45 minutes or so.
[02:44:27.863 --> 02:44:38.547]  And after that, I knew things and I could see, it's like they say, when you read the newspaper, the truth is between the lines.
[02:44:39.147 --> 02:44:41.968]  And I started to see what those lines between the lines were.
[02:44:42.288 --> 02:44:44.769]  I just saw the world in a different way.
[02:44:45.650 --> 02:44:54.453]  And it becomes a point where you don't even have to lie on your bed or anything like that, that it becomes a part of you.
[02:44:55.416 --> 02:45:06.319]  So it's not that there's some external force communicating with you in the sense that that force is you.
[02:45:06.820 --> 02:45:11.801]  You're just recognizing a manifestation of your own interdimensional eternal will.
[02:45:15.642 --> 02:45:28.593]   Yes, because it's like In China, they firewall off the computer system so that Chinese people cannot access most of the internet, all the stuff they're not supposed to have.
[02:45:29.233 --> 02:45:39.782]  Now, therefore, if they only access what the Chinese fascist government wants them to see, then they'll have a certain perception.
[02:45:40.834 --> 02:45:50.778]  But if they got access to the whole internet, this is just an analogy, they would have a vastly more expanded perception of reality and possibility.
[02:45:51.518 --> 02:45:56.060]  And that's what happens when you open your mind to expanded levels of consciousness.
[02:45:56.120 --> 02:45:58.061]  And by the way, we know this is science in closing.
[02:45:58.781 --> 02:45:59.662]  We know this is science.
[02:45:59.702 --> 02:46:00.982]  It's a well-known process.
[02:46:01.002 --> 02:46:01.663]  You can speak to it.
[02:46:01.983 --> 02:46:03.623]  The 100th monkey syndrome.
[02:46:04.024 --> 02:46:05.964]  They found it in other animals and also in humans.
[02:46:06.425 --> 02:46:09.186]  You can have monkeys 20 miles away on another island with the same species.
[02:46:10.006 --> 02:46:14.490]  Who are taught how to use a rock or whatever to open a fruit.
[02:46:15.090 --> 02:46:17.592]  And the other monkeys, same species for thousands of years, have never done it.
[02:46:17.652 --> 02:46:30.282]  But because somebody showed them how, as soon as they learn somehow sixth sense interdimensionally, because they're on the same frequency as the same species of monkey, 20-30 miles away, suddenly those monkeys know how to do it.
[02:46:30.582 --> 02:46:33.244]  I mean, that really illustrates that there's this ether out there.
[02:46:34.471 --> 02:46:36.833]  Well, yeah, what I call the field, yeah.
[02:46:37.633 --> 02:46:47.279]  The five senses, there's a few things on that, the five senses, if you look at them, they decode what we call form, things.
[02:46:48.160 --> 02:47:00.910]   So I'm looking around this room and I can see things, computer, a cup, whatever, but My five senses are only tuned to that frequency, what we call form.
[02:47:01.290 --> 02:47:07.272]  Therefore, I perceive reality as form with empty space in between.
[02:47:08.052 --> 02:47:09.633]  That's how we all see the world.
[02:47:10.313 --> 02:47:12.533]  But there is no empty space in between.
[02:47:12.692 --> 02:47:21.852]   there is a field of consciousness, energy, information that we can't see because of the
[02:47:21.852 --> 02:47:28.572]   narrow band of our sight senses, but exists, and that's what we are interacting with.
[02:47:28.572 --> 02:47:33.452]   And this is why this cult wants to dominate the frequency nature of the field.
[02:47:33.452 --> 02:47:35.292]  And David, I know that's the case.
[02:47:35.292 --> 02:47:39.332]   Take the movie "The Island," which I won't do the whole plot of, but you may have seen
[02:47:39.332 --> 02:47:42.371]   it, it's really a movie from like 15 years ago, where they have these clones of rich
[02:47:42.371 --> 02:47:44.092]  people in this underground base.
[02:47:44.092 --> 02:47:47.972]   They think they're part of, you know, after a biological war, living in safety, when they
[02:47:47.972 --> 02:47:50.893]   finally get to go, they go to the island to be free and, you know, in the outside world.
[02:47:50.893 --> 02:47:55.932]   But really, that's when their person that paid for a clone of their body for organ harvesting
[02:47:55.932 --> 02:47:56.932]  needs the body part.
[02:47:56.932 --> 02:47:59.451]   They think they won a lottery, they're going to the island, they're actually taken and
[02:47:59.451 --> 02:48:00.852]  killed and their organs taken.
[02:48:00.852 --> 02:48:08.051]   But they find, after they shut it down, that suddenly it's some type of psychic interface
[02:48:08.051 --> 02:48:12.893]   that the humans clone on the outside, even though it's a thousand miles away or 10,000
[02:48:12.893 --> 02:48:17.972]   miles away, starts actually getting the memories and the understanding of their copy.
[02:48:17.960 --> 02:48:21.801]  And so the globalists know this, they put it in all the literature of the culture, now it's coming out.
[02:48:21.881 --> 02:48:27.802]  Why do they simultaneously tell us what they're doing and how they're doing it while denying it and suppressing it?
[02:48:28.322 --> 02:48:29.242]  What's the rule there?
[02:48:30.302 --> 02:48:32.344]  Well, there's two things, really.
[02:48:32.364 --> 02:48:39.909]  I mean, like I said earlier, we're at the point now where they're actually doing it in the world of the scene.
[02:48:40.570 --> 02:48:42.011]  Therefore, they can't hide it.
[02:48:42.071 --> 02:48:48.916]  What they have to do, and they've gone into, is sales pitch mode, in selling it as a wonderful thing.
[02:48:48.936 --> 02:48:54.680]  They can't hide it anymore, because if they keep hiding it, it won't become reality in the world that we're living in.
[02:48:55.981 --> 02:49:01.884]  So yeah, and you know, this thing about the field is really important.
[02:49:01.964 --> 02:49:23.835]   You know, the ancient tribal people, some of which of course still exist in Africa and places, they have this communication system which became known as the bush telegraph, where people out hunting could have an instinct of what was happening back
[02:49:23.835 --> 02:49:26.295]   in the village even though they were nowhere near it.
[02:49:26.295 --> 02:49:30.056]   And by the way, this is in mainline studies in Australia with the Aborigines that are
[02:49:30.056 --> 02:49:34.656]   so psychic and so tied into it that a lot of them work in the mines, in some cases 3,000
[02:49:34.656 --> 02:49:35.656]  miles away.
[02:49:35.656 --> 02:49:39.176]   And the mine operators, people have learned, when they say, because they're hardworking,
[02:49:39.176 --> 02:49:43.856]   I got to leave the mine, I got to go, my mother's sick or my dad just died or my mother was
[02:49:43.856 --> 02:49:47.056]  just hit by a car, 100% of the time they're right.
[02:49:47.056 --> 02:49:50.816]   That was back before they even had the telephones and stuff to check, going back 60, 70, 80
[02:49:50.816 --> 02:49:54.295]   years ago when they said something was happening to their family, they were always right.
[02:49:54.295 --> 02:49:55.295]  The Bush telegraph.
[02:49:55.295 --> 02:49:59.056]  Yeah, and just a simple example.
[02:49:59.056 --> 02:50:09.056]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:50:00.310 --> 02:50:09.156]  The number of people I've met over the years, my brother's had this experience a few times, where they say, I've just had this amazing experience.
[02:50:10.477 --> 02:50:15.280]  I was thinking of somebody and I hadn't seen him for ages, but I suddenly started thinking of him.
[02:50:15.681 --> 02:50:18.523]  And then the bloody phone rang and guess who it was?
[02:50:18.563 --> 02:50:19.123]  It was them!
[02:50:19.143 --> 02:50:22.385]  Well, I mean, that's extraordinary, isn't it?
[02:50:22.525 --> 02:50:22.805]  No.
[02:50:23.946 --> 02:50:33.319]   Because when you were thinking of them, They were thinking of you because they were about to ring you.
[02:50:34.511 --> 02:50:49.904]  And so the frequency that they give off as they're thinking of you, and their attention is thinking of you, therefore it's possible to tune into your energy field because that's who they're thinking of.
[02:50:50.104 --> 02:50:51.626]  And David, I've got a perfect example of this.
[02:50:52.647 --> 02:50:55.649]  My son Rex wanted to work on my family ranch for the last year.
[02:50:55.689 --> 02:50:57.331]  He's been gone most of the time after high school.
[02:50:57.351 --> 02:50:59.092]  He wanted to take a year off and work as a farmer.
[02:50:59.853 --> 02:51:05.051]   And about two years ago, He wanted to borrow a sports watch that I had.
[02:51:05.091 --> 02:51:07.072]  Not a very expensive watch, just a regular, you know, watch.
[02:51:07.893 --> 02:51:11.535]  And he's moved back to town the last month, doing a bunch of stuff.
[02:51:12.076 --> 02:51:13.497]  And he came by the house the other morning.
[02:51:13.517 --> 02:51:15.418]  We were going to go on a hike before I had to go into work.
[02:51:15.478 --> 02:51:16.278]  It's like 6.30 in the morning.
[02:51:16.639 --> 02:51:17.779]  He shows up, he walks in.
[02:51:18.500 --> 02:51:19.941]  And I just had this feeling.
[02:51:20.781 --> 02:51:23.703]  I never do this stuff, but I wanted to show him how real the sixth sense is.
[02:51:24.244 --> 02:51:25.985]  And I said, I know you brought me my watch back.
[02:51:27.165 --> 02:51:30.128]  And he literally turned white, sort of gulping and gasping.
[02:51:30.148 --> 02:51:31.129]  He says, how did you know that?
[02:51:31.349 --> 02:51:32.350]  I hadn't asked for it in years.
[02:51:32.890 --> 02:51:33.811]  I never asked for it back.
[02:51:34.112 --> 02:51:35.793]  He said, I've got the watch right here.
[02:51:35.833 --> 02:51:37.215]  I was bringing it to you this morning.
[02:51:38.135 --> 02:51:44.081]  And I had him on there to say that, but I've learned now, when I know stuff's going on, I go ahead and tell people because it's never wrong.
[02:51:45.022 --> 02:51:48.926]  I knew that my son had brought me my watch because I was psychically picking it up.
[02:51:51.434 --> 02:51:53.597]  Yeah, and this is happening all the time.
[02:51:54.097 --> 02:51:58.803]  You know, what people call the paranormal is actually the perfectly bloody normal.
[02:51:59.184 --> 02:52:02.888]  But they call it the paranormal because they don't want us to think that's normal.
[02:52:02.928 --> 02:52:05.471]  They want us to think their normal is normal, i.e.
[02:52:05.551 --> 02:52:06.773]  five sense reality.
[02:52:06.813 --> 02:52:08.715]  That's what it's all about.
[02:52:08.956 --> 02:52:10.517]  I'll give you an example.
[02:52:11.696 --> 02:52:14.697]  Alex, of just how illusory reality is.
[02:52:15.558 --> 02:52:33.686]  Now, what I'm saying in my books, what I say in The Trap, the new one, is, and I have been writing this now for, you know, 20, 25 years, is that this world only exists as we perceive it in here.
[02:52:34.606 --> 02:52:38.688]  And in here needs more explanation as well, but let's just keep it simple.
[02:52:40.182 --> 02:52:46.778]  Because the reality, the matrix, is actually an information field.
[02:52:46.879 --> 02:52:47.600]  Think Wi-Fi.
[02:52:48.863 --> 02:52:56.229]  So, the information of the matrix that we're interacting with, decoding, is like a Wi-Fi field.
[02:52:56.289 --> 02:52:57.150]  And this is the thing.
[02:52:57.470 --> 02:53:06.618]  This technological world that's unfolding is actually mimicking the world that we're experiencing as what we think is the real world.
[02:53:06.678 --> 02:53:07.238]  And they admit that.
[02:53:07.278 --> 02:53:10.381]  Google and all of them say they're building an artificial version of what they already know is there.
[02:53:11.602 --> 02:53:11.902]  Yeah.
[02:53:12.263 --> 02:53:15.025]  And so, how do the five senses work?
[02:53:16.141 --> 02:53:20.924]  They pick up frequency information, vibrational information.
[02:53:21.825 --> 02:53:23.245]  That's what the five senses do.
[02:53:23.446 --> 02:53:27.608]  Whether it's taste or sight or anything, the classic is the ears.
[02:53:28.309 --> 02:53:34.232]  Because I'm talking to you now, but words are not passing between us.
[02:53:35.093 --> 02:53:38.055]  What's passing between us is a frequency field.
[02:53:38.835 --> 02:53:41.797]  So my vocal cords are vibrating a frequency field.
[02:53:42.952 --> 02:53:52.878]  The ears pick up that frequency field, this is mainstream science by the way, pick up that frequency field and they turn it into an electrical signal.
[02:53:53.398 --> 02:54:13.433]   And that electrical signal goes to the brain which then decodes that information, now in electrical form, into A holographic, a digital holographic reality, which exists only in here, but actually we perceive it as being outside of us.
[02:54:14.214 --> 02:54:26.642]  So what is happening is we are decoding information in this simulation field into a perceived reality.
[02:54:27.942 --> 02:54:31.525]  And this is how computers work.
[02:54:32.338 --> 02:54:37.020]  It's like I say, the technological world of today is mimicking the reality we're experiencing.
[02:54:37.381 --> 02:55:01.715]   So if there's a Wi-Fi field where I'm here, then the computer decodes that Wi-Fi field, or the part of it that I program it to decode at any point, and it puts on the screen that Wi-Fi field information in a completely different form Well, let's just expand and finish on that.
[02:55:01.755 --> 02:55:03.675]  This has been a riveting interview, but I don't want to abuse your time.
[02:55:05.295 --> 02:55:07.516]  Is it that they're trying to suppress our natural ability?
[02:55:07.616 --> 02:55:08.856]  Is our ability getting stronger?
[02:55:08.876 --> 02:55:27.877]   I feel like we're breaking out of it, and we're seeing more connection to the psychic, more connection to the field, and that there's almost a human, natural, spiritual, energetic rebellion to this suppression, and that some of us are going to call it transcend faster while others are going to fall to
[02:55:27.877 --> 02:55:32.308]   this control. I mean, is there a dividing of the wheat from the chaff or what are they
[02:55:32.308 --> 02:55:33.558]  trying to suppress?
[02:55:33.558 --> 02:55:42.438]   What's happening, Alex, is the division is those who are going deeper into the program
[02:55:42.438 --> 02:55:51.638]   and those who are awakening from the program. And as you open your mind and escape the program,
[02:55:51.638 --> 02:55:56.597]   the perceptual program, that's when people watching this who've been through this process.
[02:55:56.597 --> 02:55:57.097]  is.
[02:55:57.682 --> 02:55:59.403]  And it's vast now, globally.
[02:56:00.043 --> 02:56:04.545]  They'll start to become more what we call psychic.
[02:56:05.126 --> 02:56:08.007]  They will start to suddenly have insights.
[02:56:08.688 --> 02:56:11.329]  They'll notice the synchronicity in their life.
[02:56:11.349 --> 02:56:12.209]  Well, that's what I've noticed.
[02:56:12.249 --> 02:56:15.651]  The more I go with it, and I'm not ashamed of it, the stronger it gets.
[02:56:15.691 --> 02:56:16.471]  It was already there.
[02:56:16.852 --> 02:56:19.593]  I'm just opening those channels up more and becoming more focused on them.
[02:56:20.689 --> 02:56:22.030]  Exactly, that's how it works.
[02:56:22.630 --> 02:56:30.554]  And you can see now, Alex, why the whole foundation of this conspiracy is holding people in five cents myopia.
[02:56:31.174 --> 02:56:37.275]   Because when you do that, and what it is, it's a focus of attention, Can I see it, touch it, taste it, hear it?
[02:56:37.335 --> 02:56:40.236]  Oh, it exists then, or if I can't, then it doesn't.
[02:56:40.416 --> 02:56:41.116]  That mentality.
[02:56:41.376 --> 02:56:41.977]  Which what?
[02:56:42.317 --> 02:56:48.879]  Dominates science, dominates medicine, dominates academia, dominates the media, dominates government.
[02:56:49.040 --> 02:56:49.520]  All of them.
[02:56:50.500 --> 02:56:56.683]  And when you break out of that, then you start to access levels of awareness, insight, knowledge.
[02:56:57.443 --> 02:56:59.285]  Not a psychopath on the screen, I see.
[02:56:59.366 --> 02:57:04.913]  But yeah, what you're showing here, Alex, is absolutely what is happening.
[02:57:05.413 --> 02:57:08.718]  Symbolically, yes, in this case, but absolutely happening.
[02:57:09.258 --> 02:57:25.087]   Imagine if you come out of the womb With a headset on, and you go through your entire life and out the other end with the same headset on, and that headset is feeding you a version of reality, i.e.
[02:57:25.107 --> 02:57:25.967]  the simulation.
[02:57:26.628 --> 02:57:34.233]  You will go through your entire life believing that the reality you're being fed is reality, true reality.
[02:57:35.054 --> 02:57:43.884]   And you see, when people put their headsets on, maybe in an empty room, how suddenly, because of the information they're receiving,
[02:57:43.884 --> 02:57:46.764]  they thrash around as if it's real.
[02:57:46.764 --> 02:57:49.164]  Now, what is that headset doing?
[02:57:49.164 --> 02:57:54.203]   And the gloves they put on, and the audio they put on in these virtual reality games,
[02:57:54.203 --> 02:58:02.754]   it's hijacking and overriding the five-sense system of decoding reality that we normally
[02:58:02.754 --> 02:58:03.324]  have.
[02:58:03.566 --> 02:58:11.712]  So the sight senses will be influenced in terms of sense of reality by what's going into the eyes with the mass thing.
[02:58:15.024 --> 02:58:18.125]  The feel of the gloves will give you the touch senses.
[02:58:19.746 --> 02:58:22.127]  It's literally hacking into the five senses.
[02:58:22.167 --> 02:58:23.787]  That's what these virtual reality games are doing.
[02:58:25.068 --> 02:58:28.049]  And you will believe if you have a headset on your entire life.
[02:58:28.823 --> 02:58:29.404]  That's right.
[02:58:29.224 --> 02:58:30.584]  what it's feeding you is real.
[02:58:30.584 --> 02:58:31.904]  And that's the human plight.
[02:58:31.904 --> 02:58:32.943]  That's the human plight.
[02:58:32.943 --> 02:58:36.143]   But if you take the headset off, and that's basically what happens
[02:58:36.143 --> 02:58:40.344]   when you start to expand your awareness, you start to see what you couldn't see before
[02:58:40.344 --> 02:58:45.743]   'cause you are now overriding the information that's being fed symbolically.
[02:58:45.743 --> 02:58:47.504]  That's right, these are brain and body acts.
[02:58:47.504 --> 02:58:50.063]   We know all the big companies, all the intelligence agencies
[02:58:50.063 --> 02:58:51.942]  are obsessed with it for decades.
[02:58:51.942 --> 02:58:54.344]  They're now rolling out from bed at operational.
[02:58:53.944 --> 02:58:55.124]  David, incredible interview.
[02:58:55.184 --> 02:58:56.064]  Only meant to have you an hour.
[02:58:56.424 --> 02:58:58.145]  Thanks for spending so much time with us on Saturday.
[02:58:58.585 --> 02:59:00.065]  In closing, I haven't read your new book yet.
[02:59:00.085 --> 02:59:01.086]  I've read almost all the other books.
[02:59:01.106 --> 02:59:01.746]  They're all incredible.
[02:59:01.766 --> 02:59:02.366]  They're all different.
[02:59:02.646 --> 02:59:03.906]  I love the cover of this new one.
[02:59:04.206 --> 02:59:05.547]  Tell us a little bit about The Trap.
[02:59:08.088 --> 02:59:12.609]  Well, the... Crikey.
[02:59:13.069 --> 02:59:14.309]  You've got another hour, Alex, have you?
[02:59:14.349 --> 02:59:38.881]   But very simply, I wanted to... I mean, I go into all the Five Cents stuff in the book and update all that to what's happening now, but there's a large chunk of the second half of the book where I look at reality and I ask the question, okay, if this is a simulation, I believe it is, then
[02:59:40.561 --> 02:59:42.363]  Where does the simulation end?
[02:59:42.423 --> 02:59:49.168]  My question was this, when consciousness leaves the body at the end of a human life, why the hell does it come back?
[02:59:49.989 --> 02:59:52.671]  If it's had a horrific experience, why does it come back?
[02:59:53.212 --> 02:59:53.932]  Why is that?
[02:59:54.933 --> 03:00:15.588]   And I started to look at what people call the spirit world, and I was reading accounts of You know, people take people into regression and some people go, they take them into what they call the between-life state.
[03:00:15.668 --> 03:00:20.832]  You know, a lot of these regressions are, you know, you were Napoleon in a previous life or something.
[03:00:21.332 --> 03:00:29.559]  But these specifically, the between-life state, what's the memory there?
[03:00:30.460 --> 03:00:33.542]  And the common themes are extraordinary.
[03:00:34.523 --> 03:00:41.568]   And when I, When I first looked at this, I thought, this is another freaking hierarchy.
[03:00:42.288 --> 03:00:43.528]  This is another trap.
[03:00:44.248 --> 03:00:46.929]  And a lot of things started to happen.
[03:00:46.949 --> 03:00:50.870]  A lot of information synchronistically started coming into my life at the same time.
[03:00:51.670 --> 03:01:05.113]  That kind of showed me that what we call reincarnation is real, but it's a trap.
[03:01:06.403 --> 03:01:14.613]  So, you know, you leave the body, and you're supposed to go through this bloody tunnel and whatever, and all that.
[03:01:15.815 --> 03:01:17.216]  And then you come back.
[03:01:17.930 --> 03:01:44.310]  And I looked at the Eastern religious and Buddhist kind of version of all this, and I thought, well, what they're saying is that you have to keep coming into this world over and over again and having different experiences to learn lessons and reach a point of what they call enlightenment, high frequency perception, to break the cycle and get out of here.
[03:01:44.510 --> 03:01:46.532]  So I thought, OK, well, let's have a look at that.
[03:01:47.395 --> 03:02:05.530]  So, if you look at the projection of mainstream science of the size of this planet, compared with the perceived size of what they call the universe, it is the equivalent of a billionth of a pinhead.
[03:02:06.831 --> 03:02:07.131]  Right?
[03:02:07.171 --> 03:02:10.114]  So I'm thinking, okay, let's follow this through.
[03:02:10.774 --> 03:02:24.861]   You have to keep reincarnating onto a billionth of a pinhead To learn lessons so that you reach a point of enlightenment where you don't have to keep reincarnating onto a billionth of a pinhead.
[03:02:24.881 --> 03:02:26.963]  Well, that makes nobody sense to me at all.
[03:02:27.303 --> 03:02:27.583]  None!
[03:02:28.443 --> 03:02:30.085]  But then I thought, well, hold on a second.
[03:02:32.306 --> 03:02:41.732]  If this simulation is not only this trap, is not only the level we experience it in the human world, but actually when you leave the body, it's still a trap.
[03:02:42.312 --> 03:02:44.794]  It's still the simulation, it's a different level of it.
[03:02:45.643 --> 03:03:11.221]   Then you can then start to understand that you're not actually Reincarnating onto a billionth of a pinhead planet, you are in a simulation, think a more advanced version of the Metaverse, where you are just going in and out of different levels, this level and different levels of the simulation.
[03:03:11.842 --> 03:03:20.188]  And, you know, you look again at ancient cultures and you look at an old esoteric concept of what they call the Ring Pass Knot.
[03:03:21.127 --> 03:03:28.880]  And the ring pass not is a it's like you could symbolize it as the as a bubble, the outer shell of a bubble.
[03:03:29.641 --> 03:03:31.524]  And it's a frequency trap.
[03:03:32.739 --> 03:03:49.163]  And before consciousness can get out of the multi-level matrix, the reincarnation matrix, into prime reality and infinity, you have to reach a certain vibrational frequency state to get through that.
[03:03:49.723 --> 03:03:55.224]  And so now they're creating here on the earth a trap within a trap within a trap to keep us from figuring out we're in a trap.
[03:03:56.087 --> 03:03:58.048]  Exactly, exactly what they're doing.
[03:03:58.108 --> 03:04:08.174]  So you can, again, you can look at the Christian view, which is there is no such thing as reincarnation, and if you believe in it then you're this, that, and the other.
[03:04:08.214 --> 03:04:09.055]  Some of them believe.
[03:04:09.655 --> 03:04:13.057]  But it's about, well, let's just take a breath here.
[03:04:15.079 --> 03:04:21.603]  Reincarnation is not a creation of what people call God in that sense.
[03:04:23.074 --> 03:04:29.136]  It's a creation of a very negative force, this trap, this cycle, literally recycling consciousness.
[03:04:29.156 --> 03:04:31.577]  It's captured our soul in a form of purgatory hell.
[03:04:32.257 --> 03:04:43.580]  Yeah, yeah, so... Well, undoubtedly, if this is purgatory, which I believe is basically the best concept for it, there's another level, obviously, that we could be sucked into even worse, which people could call hell.
[03:04:43.800 --> 03:04:46.341]  Because these creatures that act like this, that sounds like hell to me.
[03:04:47.503 --> 03:05:02.797]  Well, this lower level of this astral dimension is what they call Hell, and the Gnostics who wrote about this stuff all that time ago... Well, to me this doesn't discredit the Christian system, it just means men are manipulating it.
[03:05:02.817 --> 03:05:08.162]  It actually makes perfect sense as someone who, you know, I'll call myself a Christian, this makes perfect sense what you're saying.
[03:05:08.854 --> 03:05:30.841]  Yeah, I mean, the point is, Alex, that what I would say to everyone who follows a religion is we can see a fraction of 0.005% of what is supposed to exist in this universe, and a single book within that frequency band is not going to give us all the answers.
[03:05:31.081 --> 03:05:38.597]   It might give us some, There's a lot of truth in the Bible, there's a lot of truth in a lot of religious books, and there's stuff that I don't go with.
[03:05:38.997 --> 03:05:42.383]  The point is, if we just relax a bit...
[03:05:43.271 --> 03:05:49.317]  And don't say, if you don't believe this, you're a blasphemer, you don't believe this, you're this, that and the other.
[03:05:49.377 --> 03:05:51.720]  Just say, well, let's just talk to each other.
[03:05:52.060 --> 03:05:56.024]  Because actually, we're probably not a million miles from each other.
[03:05:56.485 --> 03:06:04.933]   So is there a force that Christians call God, a benevolent force, a Well, take epigenetics.
[03:06:04.752 --> 03:06:10.752]   I say there is and I say it's a consciousness, it's a form of consciousness.
[03:06:10.752 --> 03:06:17.752]   But is there also reincarnation between different levels of this simulation within that infinity?
[03:06:17.752 --> 03:06:20.752]  Well, I say yes, there absolutely is.
[03:06:20.752 --> 03:06:21.752]  Well, I mean take epigenetics.
[03:06:21.752 --> 03:06:22.752]  That's another form.
[03:06:22.752 --> 03:06:27.752]   There's multi forms of consciousness where we know we have instincts that are passed on that are literally memories.
[03:06:27.752 --> 03:06:30.752]   I mean they've done studies with 20 generations, as you know,
[03:06:30.752 --> 03:06:36.752]   of chickens raised inside a facility inside a five-story building is one of the studies that was done back in the 70s.
[03:06:36.752 --> 03:06:38.752]  It went on for more than 20 years.
[03:06:38.752 --> 03:06:43.820]   and The chickens were raised generation, regeneration, regeneration, regeneration.
[03:06:43.840 --> 03:06:46.000]  They never saw a hawk, never saw a weasel.
[03:06:46.420 --> 03:06:54.202]  And they could project with a projector on the roof a triangle or a square, and the animals weren't scared of it, didn't run into the coop.
[03:06:54.602 --> 03:07:01.064]  But when they would project the image of a hawk and put a hawk's scream on it, they would all run into the coop knowing what it was.
[03:07:01.124 --> 03:07:02.744]  And so the thing was, they had instincts.
[03:07:03.044 --> 03:07:06.585]  Though they'd never seen a hawk for 20 generations, they knew what it was.
[03:07:06.665 --> 03:07:10.680]   So that is You can call that reincarnation of information.
[03:07:11.341 --> 03:07:13.723]  Take our genetics, like this body suit, this earth suit.
[03:07:14.164 --> 03:07:14.985]  How do you square that?
[03:07:15.005 --> 03:07:17.527]  We're manifesting in these bodies, and we're spiritual beings.
[03:07:17.587 --> 03:07:18.929]  I agree with you, it's true.
[03:07:19.049 --> 03:07:22.933]  But we look like our fathers and mothers and carry that genetic line as well.
[03:07:23.513 --> 03:07:25.155]  How do you integrate those?
[03:07:25.175 --> 03:07:26.697]  Because I had a vision...
[03:07:29.525 --> 03:07:34.627]  Yeah, it can be, very simply, and what you've just described can be described very simply.
[03:07:35.247 --> 03:07:40.769]  And that's the understanding that the body is the vehicle.
[03:07:41.990 --> 03:07:49.973]  Consciousness, the true I, is what is experiencing this reality, briefly, through the vehicle.
[03:07:50.793 --> 03:07:56.496]  So the vehicle is the way that we interact with the simulation.
[03:07:57.475 --> 03:08:06.146]  Thus, if you think of it as a software program, because that's how the cult see it, as a software program.
[03:08:06.266 --> 03:08:10.792]  That's why people like Moderna talk about the fake vaccine as an operating system.
[03:08:11.072 --> 03:08:12.374]  They know how this works.
[03:08:12.394 --> 03:08:13.175]  They just don't want us to know.
[03:08:17.105 --> 03:08:27.067]  The passing on of the software program through procreation passes on these instincts.
[03:08:27.147 --> 03:08:35.209]  This is why a duck acts like a duck, an elephant acts like an elephant, and a duck doesn't act like an elephant.
[03:08:35.330 --> 03:08:44.273]   It's because these software programs, information, is passed on through the species generations.
[03:08:44.333 --> 03:08:57.824]  What consciousness is doing is coming in to the vehicle, well it's much more than that as I say, the body's in the mind not the mind in the body, but the theme is the same.
[03:09:02.510 --> 03:09:04.331]  Let me add this point to you.
[03:09:04.971 --> 03:09:09.854]  For me, in my own understanding, this is not any books, not any religions, not any systems.
[03:09:10.255 --> 03:09:14.357]  I haven't gotten to a lot of it because it's really amazing and very complex and trying to understand it.
[03:09:14.377 --> 03:09:18.660]  It's nothing anybody's ever seen that I've seen in books or literature, but I know it to be true.
[03:09:19.340 --> 03:09:29.967]  There are spiritual families and groups that are also coming into this dimension into certain bloodlines, and just like there's evil bloodlines, there's good bloodlines, and the enemy knows that.
[03:09:31.485 --> 03:09:33.066]  Yeah, I mean, there's groups.
[03:09:33.546 --> 03:09:49.855]  I mean, what's happening now, and has been happening for some time, I've written about this in the books in the past, is that there is a massive effort going on now to turn all this around.
[03:09:49.875 --> 03:09:54.538]  You know, people say to me, what chance have we got?
[03:09:55.018 --> 03:10:01.814]   And I say, well, if you're talking about the five cents world alone, We've got no freaking chance.
[03:10:02.575 --> 03:10:15.906]  But if you're talking about the wider world of consciousness and expanded consciousness that is working to transform this, well, we've got every bloody chance.
[03:10:16.307 --> 03:10:16.747]  I totally agree.
[03:10:16.767 --> 03:10:17.388]  Let me ask you this.
[03:10:17.408 --> 03:10:18.108]  I don't mean to interrupt.
[03:10:18.128 --> 03:10:19.530]  Just fascinating answers here.
[03:10:19.550 --> 03:10:23.813]  I asked this before you elaborated a little bit, but just this is so important.
[03:10:24.454 --> 03:10:27.596]  Why are so many powerful leaders against this?
[03:10:28.692 --> 03:10:40.515]  Over the centuries coming out of what we would call the United Kingdom today, Ireland, Scotland, England, and let's say it, the most prominent people fighting the New World Order, you're real, I'm real, in the world also go back to that.
[03:10:41.355 --> 03:10:43.236]  I've got a big Welsh background, I know you're English.
[03:10:44.396 --> 03:10:46.676]  Why is so much coming out of the UK?
[03:10:47.017 --> 03:10:48.297]  Is it the energetic ley lines?
[03:10:48.317 --> 03:10:51.598]  Why is there so much evil and so much good happening there?
[03:10:51.958 --> 03:10:56.819]  Why are our bad bloodlines and good bloodlines emanating out of there?
[03:10:57.779 --> 03:11:23.996]   Well it's kind of funny actually you mention that because I've just completed a film which is going to be on Iconic before Christmas called Albion Heart of the World and it's about why these tiny islands that you can hardly see on the bloody globe have had such an impact on the world literally globally and the empire on which they said the sun Never said.
[03:11:24.456 --> 03:11:45.510]  But in terms of the bloodlines, what you call the good and the bad bloodlines, and these bloodlines of the cult, these interbreeding bloodlines, which for a long time, and still a few today, but for a long time took the expression of royalty, interbreeding royalty, interbreeding aristocracy.
[03:11:47.011 --> 03:12:03.472]   The point is, yes and absolutely, Charlie Boy, the mate of of Jimmy Savile and has an ancestor of Vlad the Impaler, who was one of the great Satanist mass bloodthirsty killers that ever lived.
[03:12:04.152 --> 03:12:08.498]  And he has property in Transylvania as well.
[03:12:08.818 --> 03:12:09.379]  Jolly boy.
[03:12:11.055 --> 03:12:29.793]  They're in your face, but what happened is when the people rejected in-your-face royalty in many, many, many, many countries around the world, these bloodlines simply went into another form, into the dark superfessions of politics and banking and business and all the rest of it.
[03:12:30.233 --> 03:12:42.583]   Now, I talked earlier, Alex, about the fact that the plan is to create human 2.0 as in casts, in genetic casts, which have different abilities.
[03:12:42.643 --> 03:12:55.967]  The worker cast has the ability to do its job and serve as a slave, and the elite have other genetic states, thus other abilities to process information.
[03:12:56.627 --> 03:13:10.205]   Now, the reason that these bloodlines, which are hybrids, they're part human and part non-human, They're a hybrid field, which means they're part one, part
[03:13:10.205 --> 03:13:10.464]  the other.
[03:13:10.464 --> 03:13:16.945]   Part human, part reptilian, part human, part other forms of non-human.
[03:13:17.211 --> 03:13:38.721]  The reason that they incessantly have interbred over the years and still do, not so overtly as royalty, but the eastern establishment families of the United States and the aristocracy and the various groupings around the world, they still interbreed obsessively.
[03:13:39.141 --> 03:13:39.542]  Why?
[03:13:40.402 --> 03:13:55.568]  Because they are seeking to retain a software program, a genetic software program, which if they interbred with the rest of the population, that program would quickly be diluted.
[03:13:56.068 --> 03:14:15.477]   So this program, this genetic program of the bloodline, say the blue bloods, allows them to process information In a more expansive way than the general population, it's part of their power system.
[03:14:16.018 --> 03:14:23.574]   And thus, as we have a certain A serious limit in what we could see through visible light.
[03:14:24.354 --> 03:14:30.416]  Their visual acuity and their other senses are wider.
[03:14:30.976 --> 03:14:36.817]  They can see further into this field than the human population.
[03:14:36.837 --> 03:14:39.598]  Therefore, they can see things that we can't see.
[03:14:40.198 --> 03:14:44.959]  And I'm talking the Rothschilds, I'm talking the Rockefellers, I'm talking all these different people.
[03:14:45.277 --> 03:14:50.797]   that are in the upper levels, not the highest level, but the upper levels of this cult.
[03:14:50.797 --> 03:14:58.876]   And so they are seeking to hold that software program, genetic software program that allows them to do
[03:14:58.876 --> 03:15:02.517]  that by incessantly interbreeding with each other.
[03:15:02.517 --> 03:15:10.757]   So you'll have an interbreeding marriage between Charles and Diana when he really wanted to be
[03:15:10.757 --> 03:15:14.877]  with this other lady he's married to now.
[03:15:14.877 --> 03:15:22.356]   But the genetic program demanded that he interbred with Diana.
[03:15:22.356 --> 03:15:23.797]  And this is what's going on all the time.
[03:15:23.784 --> 03:15:30.508]  This is why you have all these official marriages of royalty and other of the... Absolutely.
[03:15:30.708 --> 03:15:31.829]  What do you expect to happen?
[03:15:31.869 --> 03:15:32.410]  Last question.
[03:15:32.450 --> 03:15:34.411]  We're going to end it here, and I appreciate your time, David Icke.com.
[03:15:35.091 --> 03:15:36.672]  The new book, of course, The Trap.
[03:15:37.052 --> 03:15:38.994]  David, how do you...
[03:15:39.614 --> 03:15:41.637]  What do you expect to see happen with King Charles III?
[03:15:42.238 --> 03:15:46.423]  Absolutely evil, Jimmy Surveil, we know the whole background, Jeffrey Epstein, all of it.
[03:15:46.784 --> 03:15:54.954]  Now that he's on the throne, he gave this speech six months ago, declaring global war on humanity, a military operation, you know, to cut the carbon that'll depopulate.
[03:15:55.375 --> 03:15:57.357]  What do you expect to see now with King Charles III?
[03:16:00.302 --> 03:16:15.128]  Well, first of all, he's not going to be, for very long, able to hold himself back and enter the arena, which royalty is not supposed to do, of pushing political agendas.
[03:16:15.308 --> 03:16:22.211]  He's obviously, absolutely, hand in glove with the World Economic Forum and Schwab.
[03:16:22.231 --> 03:16:43.163]   But this is what I've been saying, Alex, now for a couple of years, and that is that Royalty, overt royalty like that, has served this cult magnificently over the centuries, because it's a wonderful way of imposing power simply by bloodline inheritance.
[03:16:43.663 --> 03:16:48.486]  You don't have to persuade the population to vote for someone, they're the leaders.
[03:16:49.006 --> 03:16:56.045]   But there came a point, of course, as I mentioned earlier, where The population grew up enough to say we're not having that anymore.
[03:16:56.085 --> 03:17:02.036]  Well, of course, they still have it in Britain and the Commonwealth, but overwhelmingly they rejected it.
[03:17:03.219 --> 03:17:08.981]  And the royal family in Britain and the Commonwealth has served this cult magnificently.
[03:17:09.061 --> 03:17:09.321]  Why?
[03:17:09.341 --> 03:17:10.302]  Because it's part of it.
[03:17:10.362 --> 03:17:11.502]  It's part of the bloodlines.
[03:17:11.522 --> 03:17:12.822]  These people are Satanists.
[03:17:14.663 --> 03:17:18.924]  Like the Queen and the Queen Mother and Prince Philip, all these people.
[03:17:19.505 --> 03:17:22.206]  I exposed all this while they were all still alive.
[03:17:23.546 --> 03:17:28.888]  And so you have this great reset now.
[03:17:29.810 --> 03:17:34.812]  Which is a great reset of the entire global system.
[03:17:35.733 --> 03:17:48.439]  And for me, this great reset new system does not require any longer what we call royalty, because it's going to centrally control from the global center.
[03:17:48.479 --> 03:17:49.799]  It's going to do it through AI.
[03:17:50.540 --> 03:18:05.329]   And I said a couple of years ago that when the Queen and Prince Philip died, particularly the Queen, Then the process of withdrawal with dismantling royalty would begin.
[03:18:06.790 --> 03:18:14.137]  And of course, they're going to use Charles profusely for a while to push this agenda.
[03:18:14.969 --> 03:18:26.453]  But when you look at the royal family in Britain now, there's him and then his son William, and then you're going down to William's little boy.
[03:18:27.134 --> 03:18:36.297]  So there's not a lot left, especially with, you know, Harry and Meghan Markle firing Exocet missiles across the Atlantic.
[03:18:37.698 --> 03:18:42.639]  And so I do see royalty being phased out.
[03:18:42.659 --> 03:18:44.240]  And this is one reason for it.
[03:18:47.252 --> 03:18:53.997]  When you target Western society, which is what they're doing, they want to dismantle, completely dismantle Western society.
[03:18:54.037 --> 03:18:55.999]  That's why the southern border of the United States is wider.
[03:18:56.239 --> 03:19:00.702]  Even though the royalty isn't Western civilization, it's still a symbol of that, so they have to take it away.
[03:19:01.463 --> 03:19:02.123]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:19:02.163 --> 03:19:03.945]  So let's look at this, okay?
[03:19:05.194 --> 03:19:07.655]  You want to dismantle Western civilization.
[03:19:07.875 --> 03:19:13.978]  So the first thing you look at is what's the dominant racial group of Western civilization.
[03:19:14.419 --> 03:19:15.279]  It's the white race.
[03:19:15.739 --> 03:19:16.960]  So you target that.
[03:19:17.180 --> 03:19:21.122]  That's why we're having this unbelievable racist targeting.
[03:19:21.722 --> 03:19:34.712]  Of white people, because if the dominant race of the Western society, which they want to dismantle, was the black race or the brown race or whatever, they'd be targeting that in the same way.
[03:19:34.752 --> 03:19:35.253]  But it isn't.
[03:19:35.353 --> 03:19:37.474]  It's the white race, for historical reasons.
[03:19:37.774 --> 03:19:38.795]  So they're targeting that.
[03:19:39.796 --> 03:19:42.278]  Then you look at Christianity.
[03:19:42.718 --> 03:20:02.637]   Now, for historical reasons, whether you're a Christian or not, For historical reasons, not least in Europe, America, or all over the Western world, that has become weaved into the fabric of Western society.
[03:20:02.657 --> 03:20:14.426]  Whether you're a Christian or not, there it is, there's churches everywhere, there's, you know, we have an Archbishop of Canterbury, we have the monarch of Britain as the head of the church and all that stuff, it's been weaved.
[03:20:15.206 --> 03:20:28.817]  And so if you want to pull the cards out of the house of cards of Western society, you pull them out of the white race and you pull them out of Christianity for historical reasons.
[03:20:28.877 --> 03:20:38.986]  I mean Europe is massively historically founded, therefore still, on the weaving in its institutions etc of Christianity.
[03:20:39.366 --> 03:20:44.818]   And then you look in Britain and the Commonwealth at At the Royal Family.
[03:20:45.959 --> 03:20:51.162]  We don't have, Alex, a British government.
[03:20:51.643 --> 03:20:55.506]  We have her, now His Majesty's government.
[03:20:55.866 --> 03:20:58.468]  We don't have an opposition party in Britain.
[03:20:58.788 --> 03:21:03.111]  We have her, His Majesty's most loyal opposition.
[03:21:03.151 --> 03:21:04.312]  That's what it's called.
[03:21:04.933 --> 03:21:22.741]   We have Her Majesty's, now His Majesty's, Border control, passport control, treasury, you take royalty out of British society and the whole thing has to be reset.
[03:21:23.562 --> 03:21:28.504]  You look around the Commonwealth, Canada, Australia, who's the head of state?
[03:21:29.464 --> 03:21:32.066]  The monarch of Britain, stunningly in 2022.
[03:21:32.646 --> 03:21:41.130]   So that has to be all reset Once royalty falls and ceases to be what it is now.
[03:21:41.630 --> 03:21:45.594]  Now, I'm not saying that's going to happen tomorrow, but I'm saying it's part of the Great Reset.
[03:21:45.694 --> 03:21:46.495]  Oh, I totally agree.
[03:21:46.575 --> 03:21:55.282]  And what you're doing is the 35,000 foot view, that it's not that royalty is good, but it's seen as British establishment and culture, even though it's not.
[03:21:55.643 --> 03:21:58.745]  So a lot of people see the left attacking royalty and think, oh, it must be good.
[03:21:59.106 --> 03:22:01.748]  Like Paul Joseph Watson's a great guy, smart guy, but he believes that.
[03:22:02.189 --> 03:22:04.711]  And it's the Stockholm Syndrome, in my view.
[03:22:05.131 --> 03:22:08.715]  Obviously it's terrible, it's horrible, they're not even British, they're not Scottish, they're not Irish.
[03:22:09.075 --> 03:22:17.944]  You know, since King George I, 300 years ago, it's been this basically Eastern European, Transylvanian, was our bloodline.
[03:22:17.984 --> 03:22:22.308]  And I keep saying, final question, we've done deep research, we know it goes back to Vladimir Paylor.
[03:22:22.648 --> 03:22:28.153]  Prince Charles mainly, he says, lives more time than in the UK, in Transylvania, I guess now that he's not the king.
[03:22:28.974 --> 03:22:29.514]  Or is the king?
[03:22:29.795 --> 03:22:34.518]  He'll try to move back, but he's in all these documentaries admitting he lives in Dracula's own castle.
[03:22:34.538 --> 03:22:35.839]  I mean, it's beyond bizarre.
[03:22:36.840 --> 03:22:38.861]  But who are these people, really?
[03:22:39.381 --> 03:22:40.462]  Because they're not even German.
[03:22:41.063 --> 03:22:45.226]  They call them German royalty, but they're not.
[03:22:45.246 --> 03:22:46.126]  They're not the Tudors.
[03:22:46.907 --> 03:22:48.488]  They're not the Stuarts.
[03:22:49.148 --> 03:22:55.613]  They're not really related to William the Conqueror, because we know England's been run by a bunch of other people.
[03:22:56.193 --> 03:22:57.114]  But who are they?
[03:22:57.294 --> 03:22:58.495]  Who is the House of the Dragon?
[03:23:01.171 --> 03:23:11.294]  What they are, Alex, is they are expressions, quite obvious ones if you look at it, of this hybrid human-non-human bloodline.
[03:23:11.374 --> 03:23:17.515]  And what was interesting at the Queen's funeral is all the royalty turns up from around the bloody world.
[03:23:17.555 --> 03:23:19.916]  That's what's left, almost all of it, in Europe.
[03:23:20.828 --> 03:23:36.102]  And they were saying, oh, well, this royalty from, I don't know, Denmark or somewhere, or this royalty from here, or royalty from there, this is this cousin of the Queen, this is this cousin of the Queen, they're all the same bloody bloodline, these people.
[03:23:36.802 --> 03:23:48.636]  Um, and they were used for a long time to control everything, and like I say, until the people rejected that role in most of the world.
[03:23:49.516 --> 03:23:57.836]   And you know, when royalty is dismantled, the people we call royal, who are this bloodline,
[03:23:57.836 --> 03:24:00.695]  they'll just go and serve the cult in other ways.
[03:24:00.695 --> 03:24:07.575]   It's just that the institution will fall because of this great reset of everything that currently
[03:24:07.575 --> 03:24:11.656]  exists in terms of top-down human control.
[03:24:11.656 --> 03:24:16.816]   There's no reason for it anymore because the control will come from the global center and
[03:24:16.816 --> 03:24:19.816]  there'll be no need for these satellites.
[03:24:19.816 --> 03:24:24.816]   Out with the old royal bloodlines, in with the AI, who will the new super rulers of the
[03:24:24.816 --> 03:24:25.816]  planet be?
[03:24:25.816 --> 03:24:29.217]  Or will the archons publicly present themselves?
[03:24:29.217 --> 03:24:35.415]  Well, who the rulers will be is us.
[03:24:35.415 --> 03:24:45.415]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[03:24:36.596 --> 03:24:40.298]  Because we are going to bring this nonsense to an end.
[03:24:40.658 --> 03:24:42.179]  It may not seem like it.
[03:24:42.759 --> 03:24:45.440]  It may not seem like it sometimes when you look around.
[03:24:46.140 --> 03:24:50.202]  But you know, as I know, what it was like.
[03:24:50.342 --> 03:24:56.825]  I remember what it was like in 1990, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95 and onwards.
[03:24:56.885 --> 03:24:59.907]  You were a true voice in the wilderness and now you've been vindicated.
[03:25:00.723 --> 03:25:10.293]  In terms of public interest in any of this stuff, trying to get anyone to listen was a real struggle.
[03:25:10.853 --> 03:25:30.517]   I went around America, I talked to eight people just outside Chicago, I talked to five people in someone's front room in New England, but now The challenge is not finding people who want to listen to this, it's finding the time to meet the interest, as you know.
[03:25:31.578 --> 03:25:41.083]  And so, although anyone who's kind of come to this relatively recently will be saying, why aren't people waking up faster?
[03:25:41.423 --> 03:25:57.691]   Well, they should have been with me in 1990, 1991, 1992, and they've realized actually what's happening now Is a fantastic awakening to another reality that's been going on all around people, but now they're seeing it.
[03:25:58.131 --> 03:25:58.471]  Exactly.
[03:25:58.511 --> 03:26:00.992]  Okay, I've said 10 times final question, but I have a selfish question.
[03:26:01.313 --> 03:26:03.053]  Before we went on air, you were asking me as well.
[03:26:03.113 --> 03:26:04.494]  I really respect you, David, and love you.
[03:26:04.514 --> 03:26:07.935]  And I, you know, if anybody out there, I call my guru, it's you.
[03:26:07.955 --> 03:26:13.618]  I mean, you really taught me more than anybody out there, other than maybe my own life experiences, my family, and my own research.
[03:26:13.638 --> 03:26:15.619]  But you're an icon in this.
[03:26:16.639 --> 03:26:17.900]  What do you think I should do?
[03:26:17.960 --> 03:26:20.182]  Because there's this giant synthetic attack on me.
[03:26:20.642 --> 03:26:21.403]  I'm not stupid.
[03:26:22.243 --> 03:26:23.785]  I know I'm not that important at the end of the day.
[03:26:24.265 --> 03:26:31.831]  Thousands of articles a day, every local TV station in the country, every cable, foreign news, hundreds of shows a week.
[03:26:32.972 --> 03:26:37.035]  They put out more propaganda against me than even Trump many days.
[03:26:37.415 --> 03:26:41.375]   I mean, I can walk into a restaurant, a bar, I'm on the TV with all these lies,
[03:26:41.375 --> 03:26:45.455]   misrepresenting who I am, what I did off questioning a mass shooting.
[03:26:45.455 --> 03:26:47.694]  People don't know who Adam Lands is, they know who I am.
[03:26:47.694 --> 03:26:52.655]   Why do you think they're so obsessed and what is this project they're involved in?
[03:26:52.655 --> 03:26:54.655]  'Cause I can tell you, I'm not getting orders from the CIA.
[03:26:54.655 --> 03:26:56.454]  I'm independent, I'm real.
[03:26:56.454 --> 03:26:58.415]  And then I look at this massive assault.
[03:26:58.415 --> 03:27:02.015]   This is more propaganda than they had before they invaded Iraq.
[03:27:02.015 --> 03:27:06.815]   Sure, that was six months of propaganda in 1990, six months of propaganda in 2003,
[03:27:06.815 --> 03:27:08.655]  we've had folks do the numbers.
[03:27:08.655 --> 03:27:13.295]   They've put out more propaganda in five years against me than before they invaded Iraq.
[03:27:13.295 --> 03:27:14.615]  What is that?
[03:27:14.990 --> 03:27:15.630]  Well, there's a few things.
[03:27:15.530 --> 03:27:19.449]   on here? There is an obsession. I know you've been under attack as well, but I don't think
[03:27:19.449 --> 03:27:23.809]   I'm even that articulate or that good. I don't even, they are obsessed with me. And when
[03:27:23.809 --> 03:27:28.049]   I get around these globalists, they shake and physically can't even control themselves.
[03:27:28.049 --> 03:27:30.049]  They hate me so much. What do you think's going on there?
[03:27:30.049 --> 03:27:40.330]   Well, there's a few things. First of all, I said decades ago that the plan was that
[03:27:40.330 --> 03:27:48.649]   eventually no one would ever see or hear anything that wasn't approved by the authorities.
[03:27:48.699 --> 03:27:49.740]  The cult, in other words.
[03:27:50.721 --> 03:27:52.362]  And that's where we're heading.
[03:27:52.443 --> 03:27:53.423]  It's a progression.
[03:27:53.463 --> 03:27:57.666]  And that's why they started demonetizing alternative media sources.
[03:27:58.167 --> 03:28:03.431]  And then they started to try to undermine their ability to research full-time.
[03:28:04.191 --> 03:28:07.534]  And then they started outright censoring them.
[03:28:08.415 --> 03:28:09.095]  It's happened to me.
[03:28:09.175 --> 03:28:09.856]  It's happened to you.
[03:28:10.916 --> 03:28:16.421]  Because, you know, they're terrified of people knowing the truth.
[03:28:16.441 --> 03:28:22.910]   Because when people realize The truth of what's going on in big enough numbers, then it's over for them.
[03:28:24.152 --> 03:28:35.524]  And so they're targeting as fast as possible every source of information and every person who's putting this out to silence them.
[03:28:36.044 --> 03:28:42.633]  Well, David, that's my view is, I've just been picked as the lead elephant, because if they think they can get me, they can get anybody, and they admit that.
[03:28:43.013 --> 03:28:44.255]  I'm just a beta test.
[03:28:44.575 --> 03:28:46.338]  They're trying to perfect their attack on me.
[03:28:46.438 --> 03:28:50.583]  I've just been chosen as the first one to really take down with the next level of control.
[03:28:51.843 --> 03:29:12.339]  Yeah, but I'd say, yeah, that, you know, they're targeting you because of what you put out, and not only what you put out, but what, in America particularly, you symbolize, which is the information alerting people to actually what events really mean, as opposed to what we're told they mean.
[03:29:12.820 --> 03:29:26.442]   But I would just say this, mate, I know I have been, there's been a number of attempts to, To take me out financially and in other ways over the years, you know, over the years.
[03:29:27.343 --> 03:29:56.956]   But when I look back, you see, there is a force that is there to work through and help anyone who will open their minds to connect with it and then have the guts To go with what that force is encouraging us to do, which is to put this stuff out no matter what happens.
[03:29:57.136 --> 03:30:03.000]  In fact, I should have added, the attack on you in 91, 92, whenever they did that, was on every channel everywhere for a year straight.
[03:30:03.401 --> 03:30:14.490]  The ridicules, what I'm going through now, you went through decades ago, so I think that's why I'm asking you, exactly, if I just persevere and am strong and just trust, we're going to win in the end.
[03:30:16.198 --> 03:30:18.639]  Yeah, that's the reason I raised that.
[03:30:20.320 --> 03:30:34.666]  If you connect with this, and go with it, and don't run around defending yourself, but just keep saying what you are putting out.
[03:30:34.846 --> 03:30:35.586]  It's what I've done.
[03:30:36.266 --> 03:30:39.127]  I've never stopped and said, oh, you can't say those things about me.
[03:30:39.147 --> 03:30:41.508]  I've just said, well, have some more, have some more, have some more.
[03:30:42.109 --> 03:30:49.563]   And so when I look back, Alex, It's hard for most people to comprehend it, didn't see it.
[03:30:50.444 --> 03:31:03.613]  But I was subject in 1991, 92, 93, 94 and onwards to unprecedented historic levels of ridicule, mass ridicule.
[03:31:04.293 --> 03:31:09.857]  I couldn't walk down any street in Britain without being laughed at constantly by the people in the street.
[03:31:10.357 --> 03:31:13.419]  Going into a bar or pub, forget it, there was uproar.
[03:31:17.622 --> 03:31:21.684]  I would turn on the television and a comedian only had to say my name to get a laugh.
[03:31:21.724 --> 03:31:22.884]  He didn't need a joke.
[03:31:23.805 --> 03:31:33.888]  But what I did at that time, amid that absolutely mass ridicule, it was extraordinary in its scale and its viciousness.
[03:31:35.709 --> 03:31:41.362]   I went on a tour, speaking tour, of British universities.
[03:31:42.003 --> 03:31:48.594]  Can you imagine amid all that ridicule, you walk out on a stage in front of thousands of students?
[03:31:49.656 --> 03:31:54.483]  And of course, they all came to see me for one reason.
[03:31:55.276 --> 03:32:00.019]  They came to see me because they wanted to really kill and have a laugh.
[03:32:00.079 --> 03:32:00.919]  And that's what they did.
[03:32:00.959 --> 03:32:03.341]  And I remember one night I'm speaking.
[03:32:03.361 --> 03:32:04.381]  It was at a university.
[03:32:04.401 --> 03:32:08.443]  I think it's a polytechnic that it's a university now in Nottingham.
[03:32:08.824 --> 03:32:10.705]  And I walked out on the stage.
[03:32:11.665 --> 03:32:14.026]  And, um, there was uproar.
[03:32:14.666 --> 03:32:18.828]  I haven't said a word, but there was just screaming and abuse and all that stuff.
[03:32:18.848 --> 03:32:26.831]  There were glasses, not glasses, but paper cups being, paper, you know, sorry, plastic glasses, you know, beer being thrown at the stage.
[03:32:27.371 --> 03:32:28.331]  They were pillorying you!
[03:32:29.511 --> 03:32:34.113]  Yeah, and I let it die down until it went quiet because they got bored.
[03:32:35.134 --> 03:32:39.135]  And I said, you think I'm mentally ill, don't you?
[03:32:40.055 --> 03:32:46.456]  And I said, well, what does that say about you?
[03:32:47.897 --> 03:32:51.998]  You paid to come here tonight to ridicule someone you think is mentally ill.
[03:32:52.018 --> 03:32:53.218]  What does that say about you?
[03:32:54.218 --> 03:32:54.798]  Silence.
[03:32:55.738 --> 03:32:57.579]  And silence for the rest of the night.
[03:32:58.119 --> 03:33:12.475]   Because what people need to realize is when they think they're making a statement about someone else, maybe it's me, maybe it's you, They're making a statement about themselves, not the person they think they're making a statement about.
[03:33:12.895 --> 03:33:14.755]  They're revealing their true self.
[03:33:15.475 --> 03:33:18.276]  And where I'm going to go with this is this.
[03:33:19.196 --> 03:33:31.598]  If you had seen what I went through in the 90s, you would have said, that guy's finished, done, gone.
[03:33:32.378 --> 03:33:36.859]  And the media in this country, they thought they'd left another corpse.
[03:33:37.998 --> 03:33:39.298]  In the gutter.
[03:33:39.698 --> 03:33:41.759]  Finished him, they'll never see him again.
[03:33:42.659 --> 03:33:47.661]  And I got up, and I started walking, and then started running, and then I started sprinting.
[03:33:48.421 --> 03:33:57.543]  And now, the interest in my work globally is absolutely, absolutely fantastic, from that start.
[03:33:58.263 --> 03:34:06.306]   So, whatever they're doing to you now, Alex, you keep going, You'll find a way.
[03:34:06.906 --> 03:34:17.210]  You'll find a way, because this energetic guidance will manifest ways in which you will get through this.
[03:34:17.551 --> 03:34:18.171]  I can feel it.
[03:34:18.231 --> 03:34:18.651]  I can see it.
[03:34:18.671 --> 03:34:19.431]  I've experienced it.
[03:34:19.751 --> 03:34:20.572]  David Icke, incredible.
[03:34:20.612 --> 03:34:21.472]  The new book, The Trap.
[03:34:21.812 --> 03:34:24.593]  And I've got to say this, I've known you, I've been interviewing you for 25 years.
[03:34:24.994 --> 03:34:25.554]  I've known you for 28.
[03:34:25.614 --> 03:34:26.514]  Very blessed to know you.
[03:34:26.954 --> 03:34:30.536]  And you always seem strong and really informed and powerful.
[03:34:30.896 --> 03:34:49.147]   But to me, just at a distance, It seems like you've become even more authoritative, more piercing, stronger, and I just hope you live, I know you understand we live, you know, we're eternal beings, but I hope you're here for another 30, 40 years, David, because I want to win this thing and see humanity turn the corner and be there with you, and I can't wait to see you in person again.
[03:34:49.167 --> 03:34:55.110]  It's been years since I saw you, you know, outside London covering Bilderberg, but what has the transformation in closing been like for you?
[03:34:55.131 --> 03:34:56.691]  I mean, because you seem stronger than ever.
[03:34:57.992 --> 03:35:00.354]  Well, that's what happens, because it's all an illusion.
[03:35:01.178 --> 03:35:02.339]  Aging's an illusion.
[03:35:02.659 --> 03:35:03.480]  It's a program.
[03:35:04.220 --> 03:35:09.424]  And what I was saying earlier about, you know, the body software program.
[03:35:10.164 --> 03:35:21.332]  Yeah, if you are in a state of basically non-consciousness, you're in a five sense centric person, the software program is running your life.
[03:35:22.316 --> 03:35:23.997]  It's making the decisions.
[03:35:24.077 --> 03:35:25.777]  It's governing your behavior.
[03:35:26.137 --> 03:35:30.099]  You're following the cycle of aging, which is in the software program.
[03:35:30.859 --> 03:35:45.565]  But if you become conscious beyond this world, beyond the five senses, a more expanded state of consciousness, that consciousness can override the software program of the body.
[03:35:46.465 --> 03:35:56.033]  So you stay healthy, you stay strong, you get stronger the more that consciousness imposes itself on the body and overrides the software program.
[03:35:57.294 --> 03:36:03.769]   We are the power and what's happened is We're in two worlds.
[03:36:03.829 --> 03:36:08.771]  We've got the world of the cult, which is the secret society network globally, and we've got the world of the population.
[03:36:09.391 --> 03:36:14.554]  And the reason the secret society network is secret is to keep secrets from the population.
[03:36:15.134 --> 03:36:23.238]  So information knowledge is passed over through the upper levels of the secret society network that's kept from the population.
[03:36:23.299 --> 03:36:31.473]   And fundamentally, it's who we are, What this reality is, how we interact with it, how it affects us, how we affect that.
[03:36:31.593 --> 03:36:32.934]  They don't want us to know any of that.
[03:36:33.374 --> 03:36:36.156]  They don't want us to know that we are actually consciousness.
[03:36:36.496 --> 03:36:44.161]  And the fact is, when you tap into expanded levels of consciousness, you go way beyond this level of consciousness.
[03:36:44.701 --> 03:36:47.443]  This level of consciousness is the village idiot.
[03:36:48.280 --> 03:36:53.664]  Compared with the potential of human consciousness, human awareness.
[03:36:53.684 --> 03:37:01.389]  So what they've done is they've set up a human society that limits access to knowledge and information.
[03:37:01.409 --> 03:37:06.353]  That's why the Rockefellers created the education system, or what's called education system in America.
[03:37:06.513 --> 03:37:06.873]  On record.
[03:37:06.973 --> 03:37:09.435]  And so they hoard this knowledge.
[03:37:09.775 --> 03:37:15.079]  And you know, they have this symbol, the all-seeing eye.
[03:37:16.215 --> 03:37:28.945]  And that is so appropriate, because it comes from this phrase, in the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.
[03:37:29.986 --> 03:37:39.294]  This cult, these morons, these psychopaths, these pathetic people, they are the one-eyed man.
[03:37:40.282 --> 03:37:49.365]  And what they've done through control of society and the way they've structured it, and the suppression of information, is they've made humans blind.
[03:37:50.505 --> 03:37:59.448]  But when humans awaken to the two-eyed, third-eyed human, we bring an end to this.
[03:37:59.768 --> 03:38:00.008]  That's right.
[03:38:00.028 --> 03:38:05.930]   Because they are the village idiots compared with The potential of human consciousness.
[03:38:05.950 --> 03:38:06.250]  All right.
[03:38:06.730 --> 03:38:19.217]  And all we need to do is open our minds from the program and see that there are endless other ways to understand this world that they don't want us to know.
[03:38:19.417 --> 03:38:21.318]  It's a perceptual game.
[03:38:21.858 --> 03:38:24.839]  If they can control our perception, they control us.
[03:38:25.080 --> 03:38:27.281]  Well, sod that for a game of soldiers.
[03:38:27.701 --> 03:38:31.483]  I'll have my own mind, thank you, and I'll control it, not that bunch of brats.
[03:38:32.239 --> 03:38:35.261]  David, thank you so much for the time and your amazing energy and focus.
[03:38:35.801 --> 03:38:37.663]  The new book, The Trap, DavidIke.com.
[03:38:38.063 --> 03:38:41.225]  Have a great rest of Saturday evening, and I look forward to speaking to you again soon.
[03:38:41.265 --> 03:38:44.647]  I hope to shake your hand in person sometime, but thank you so much, David Ike.
[03:38:46.048 --> 03:38:47.289]  It's always a pleasure, Alex.
[03:38:47.349 --> 03:38:47.770]  Thanks, mate.
[03:38:48.510 --> 03:38:49.931]  Each interview we do just gets better.
[03:38:49.951 --> 03:38:52.873]  I'm going to come back with some final words, and that's it for this Saturday emergency broadcast.
[03:38:53.153 --> 03:38:54.774]  We'll be airing it on my show during the week.
[03:38:56.035 --> 03:38:57.536]  Gotta love David Ike, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:38:57.756 --> 03:38:58.317]  We'll be right back.
[03:38:58.337 --> 03:38:58.677]  Stay with us.

[03:39:34.520 --> 03:39:36.041]  This really is the missing link.

[03:40:23.314 --> 03:40:27.479]  But now, I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them.
[03:40:27.780 --> 03:40:28.641]  And I need your support.
[03:40:29.021 --> 03:40:45.057]   So if you want to keep this operation moving forward, if you want to back me in this fight against the globalists, please visit SaveInfoWars.com And SaveInfoWars.com takes you to a URL at GiveSendGo for direct Alex Jones Legal Defense Fund.

[03:40:50.040 --> 03:40:53.863]  And right at the end, we're not giving up, we're not giving in, but we could give out.

[03:41:01.862 --> 03:41:14.063]  [Music]
[03:41:14.063 --> 03:41:21.862]   Well, I got to tell you, I am so blessed and honored to be on air and to have just aired that two-plus-hour interview
[03:41:21.862 --> 03:41:23.862]  with David Icke.
[03:41:24.157 --> 03:41:25.478]  Absolutely amazing.
[03:41:26.979 --> 03:41:31.443]  You know, I played this two hours ago, before the interview with David Icke, but here's two short clips.
[03:41:33.015 --> 03:41:39.319]  Of the plaintiff's lawyers, Democratic Party operatives, in Texas and Connecticut saying, we want Alex Jones off the air.
[03:41:39.659 --> 03:41:41.580]  We want to take his speech away.
[03:41:41.940 --> 03:41:44.122]  I could be a convicted murderer, I still have speech.
[03:41:44.742 --> 03:41:51.826]  But these anti-American dirtbags, using the deaths of children, they believe they can use as a pretext.
[03:41:51.926 --> 03:41:53.247]  I didn't kill those kids in San Diego.
[03:41:53.487 --> 03:41:54.448]  Of course I questioned it.
[03:41:54.768 --> 03:42:01.552]  From day one, Obama came in, made it political, used their dead bodies to blame American gun owners, and I did question it.
[03:42:03.769 --> 03:42:13.161]  And I apologize to the parents if I hurt their feelings, but then I see the parents and their political tools now with these different charities and money-making operations.
[03:42:14.412 --> 03:42:20.194]  And 73 million from Remington, and they have the nerve to say, I'm making money off Sandy Hook.
[03:42:20.514 --> 03:42:22.655]  My listeners don't want to hear about Sandy Hook.
[03:42:23.035 --> 03:42:24.056]  I don't want to hear about Sandy Hook.
[03:42:24.296 --> 03:42:29.918]  I want to fight the inflation, and the open borders, and the devalued currencies, and the fentanyl, and the New World Order.
[03:42:30.438 --> 03:42:31.919]  I want to battle the New World Order.
[03:42:31.999 --> 03:42:34.140]  I want to promote God and country and family.
[03:42:35.543 --> 03:42:37.746]  But I can't do it without your support.
[03:42:37.786 --> 03:42:40.649]  So thank you, over the years, for what you've done.
[03:42:40.709 --> 03:42:41.851]  But we're the tip of the spear.
[03:42:42.091 --> 03:42:46.436]  They don't run thousands of news articles a week and hundreds of TV shows literally a week.
[03:42:46.737 --> 03:42:47.338]  It's more than that.
[03:42:48.018 --> 03:42:50.201]  Every local TV station in the country attacks me every day.
[03:42:50.221 --> 03:42:51.362]  That's thousands a day.
[03:42:52.878 --> 03:43:03.983]  They are so scared of populism, they are so scared of you, and their hatred of you and your family, their hatred of your free speech, their hatred of your love of God, is telegraphed through me!
[03:43:04.163 --> 03:43:05.924]  They see me as you!
[03:43:06.464 --> 03:43:13.707]  Because I am a populist, I am pro-family, pro-liberty, pro-success, pro-capitalism, just like you!
[03:43:15.971 --> 03:43:17.352]  So, break their will!
[03:43:17.572 --> 03:43:18.232]  Stop them!
[03:43:18.393 --> 03:43:19.533]  Annihilate them!
[03:43:20.214 --> 03:43:20.934]  In their face!
[03:43:20.994 --> 03:43:23.836]  Keep us on air in this most important fight.
[03:43:23.856 --> 03:43:28.379]  Because here's the deal, I get two years of appeals as soon as this trial ends and one more in Texas.
[03:43:28.679 --> 03:43:30.760]  Super expensive, out of control, you name it.
[03:43:30.980 --> 03:43:31.961]  Then we got two years.
[03:43:32.904 --> 03:43:36.266]  While it's on appeal, and they screwed the Constitution one side up, down the other.
[03:43:36.566 --> 03:43:45.151]  I think things will be so bad in the next two years, that they'll probably have the appeals courts go ahead and say, you can say somebody's guilty without a trial, not let them put on evidence, that's fine.
[03:43:45.431 --> 03:43:46.992]  We're just buying time to keep fighting them.
[03:43:48.853 --> 03:43:53.555]  So buy us the time for another two years to stay on air, now, while we're doing all sorts of other stuff.
[03:43:54.315 --> 03:43:56.597]  Believe me, we've only begun to fight, as John Paul Jones said.
[03:43:57.017 --> 03:44:00.539]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com now.
[03:44:01.994 --> 03:44:07.456]  And get a signed or unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World by the number one book in the last month of the world.
[03:44:09.277 --> 03:44:10.338]  Freedom is popular.
[03:44:10.618 --> 03:44:15.060]  Go to 1776coin.com and get a Man in the Arena coin.
[03:44:16.600 --> 03:44:22.263]  Teddy Roosevelt to signify you've been the man or woman in the arena to fund their operation as a fundraiser coin.

[03:44:50.856 --> 03:44:53.757]  This is like a three and a half hour emergency transmission.
[03:44:53.777 --> 03:44:55.377]  It'll be archived at Bandot Video.
[03:44:55.958 --> 03:44:57.238]  Even if you don't buy products, that's fine.
[03:44:58.809 --> 03:45:03.590]  Just share the links on your email list, your text message, override the censors.
[03:45:04.030 --> 03:45:06.211]  Know that people are more ready to be awakened than ever.
[03:45:06.491 --> 03:45:07.891]  Their minds are fertile to the truth.
[03:45:08.271 --> 03:45:14.193]  Take action now at Band.Video and InfoWars.com with the archive of this, and share the live links as well.
[03:45:14.273 --> 03:45:17.133]  And Lord willing, I'll be back tomorrow night, 4 p.m.
[03:45:17.193 --> 03:45:18.814]  Central, for the Sunday transmission.
[03:45:19.114 --> 03:45:20.454]  God bless, and good luck!
