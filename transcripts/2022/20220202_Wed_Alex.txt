[00:00.000 --> 00:17.200]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:17.200 --> 00:24.240]  Davos 2022 was largely a virtual event where the Great Reset and the United Nations Agenda
[00:24.240 --> 00:30.480]  2020-30 continued to reign supreme regardless of the growing worldwide pushback against their
[00:30.480 --> 00:36.800]  deadly premeditated vaccine ruse. Assuming that they had gained enough ground with lockdowns
[00:36.800 --> 00:44.080]  and vaccination cards, now they hurdled back onto the climate change agenda to usher in total control.
[00:44.080 --> 00:50.560]  During the Davos Agenda, we are gathering global leaders together on the imperatives
[00:50.560 --> 00:56.480]  of the year ahead. We are hearing from heads of states, heads of governments,
[00:56.480 --> 01:04.160]  business leadership, international organizations, and civil society on approaches to the most
[01:04.160 --> 01:11.600]  urgent global issues. Reformers are tackling the insidious spread of disinformation,
[01:11.600 --> 01:19.120]  such as Canada regulating online political ads. But to tackle the trust crisis we face,
[01:19.120 --> 01:25.680]  reformers must scale up these innovations, but for this they face powerful vested interests.
[01:25.680 --> 01:32.480]  In the last five years, the world has become more interconnected than ever, but in many ways
[01:32.480 --> 01:42.560]  it's becoming even more fragmented and polarized. China has made significant economic and social
[01:42.560 --> 01:49.760]  achievements under your leadership. We should join hands and rise to the challenge. I believe
[01:50.640 --> 01:58.480]  this is the best time for leaders to come together and work jointly for the world to
[01:58.480 --> 02:05.840]  become more inclusive, more sustainable, and more prosperous. We now welcome
[02:05.840 --> 02:13.280]  His Excellency Xi Jinping, President of the People's Republic of China. We need to foster
[02:13.280 --> 02:20.800]  new opportunities amidst crises. But President Xi's plans regarding the great reset have shifted
[02:20.800 --> 02:28.400]  as China reaches for a strong space age future infuriating chief enabler of leftist Marxist
[02:28.400 --> 02:38.560]  madness, George Soros. America tends to be Xi Jinping's undoing. It is much more infectious
[02:39.360 --> 02:47.920]  than any previous variant, although it's much less harmful to those who have been properly
[02:47.920 --> 02:56.080]  vaccinated. But Chinese people have only been vaccinated against the Wuhan variant,
[02:56.080 --> 03:04.240]  and Xi Jinping's guilty secret is bound to be revealed either during the Winter Olympics
[03:04.240 --> 03:14.320]  or soon thereafter. Xi tried to impose total control, but he failed. Given the strong opposition
[03:14.320 --> 03:25.040]  within the CCP, Xi Jinping's carefully choreographed elevation to the level of Mao Zedong and
[03:25.040 --> 03:34.640]  Deng Xiaoping may never occur. It is to be hoped that Xi Jinping may be replaced by someone less
[03:34.640 --> 03:43.280]  repressive at home and more peaceful abroad. This would remove the greatest threat that opens
[03:43.280 --> 03:53.280]  society's face today, and they should do everything within their power to encourage China to move in
[03:53.280 --> 04:00.160]  the desired direction. Meanwhile, the engineers of hell carry on thinly veiling their dark
[04:00.160 --> 04:05.520]  intentions with technical terms. But I think most people would agree that in Glasgow,
[04:06.880 --> 04:13.920]  there was a very significant increase of ambition on a global basis. Did it reach the
[04:13.920 --> 04:20.960]  level that we absolutely need? No. Glasgow was exciting not because we actually solved the problems,
[04:20.960 --> 04:27.280]  but because the breadth of private sector companies showed up with the willingness
[04:27.280 --> 04:35.200]  to get involved in solving those problems. We've got now a framework for how to draw them in.
[04:35.200 --> 04:39.840]  We've got to change this. We need a dramatic shift in how governments are behaving,
[04:39.840 --> 04:46.080]  and how the world is behaving. Listen to their words for yourself. This is authoritarianism at
[04:46.080 --> 04:52.320]  its peak. Unelected globalists rendering the public and private sector of governments worldwide
[04:52.320 --> 05:18.320]  as useless pawns to further their endgame. John Bowne reporting.
[05:23.040 --> 05:27.280]  behind the scenes. They want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly.
[05:28.000 --> 05:33.120]  With practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps,
[05:33.120 --> 05:38.320]  the traders know they can shut us down by force. But that would accelerate the awakening
[05:38.320 --> 05:45.200]  exponentially. So be it. Make them silence us by force. This is the final battle of the
[05:45.200 --> 05:53.760]  information war. Give now. Buy products. Donate. Before everything changes, we need you to carry
[05:53.760 --> 05:59.200]  us through to the end. Victory or death, go now to infowarstore.com.
[05:59.200 --> 06:18.640]  big brother mainstream media government coverups you want to stop tyranny well so does he lie
[06:18.640 --> 06:36.080]  from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones

[07:05.120 --> 07:14.640]  live for the next four hours wow we have lived to the point to be under true globalist
[07:14.640 --> 07:25.840]  depopulation deindustrialization attack we have lived to now be two years into their war against
[07:25.840 --> 07:34.400]  humanity their covert war their dirty war that their own documents show they are launching
[07:35.040 --> 07:42.080]  and controlling what a time to be alive the wheels are absolutely coming off of everything
[07:42.080 --> 07:51.520]  they're doing john hobkins which is a very diverse scientific group and is the preeminent
[07:53.040 --> 07:58.640]  planner for the Rockefeller foundation of the covert attacks that we've all been under
[07:58.640 --> 08:06.080]  and the subsequent lies and fraud is now covering its ass by the very working group that was
[08:06.080 --> 08:12.240]  heavily involved with bill gates planning all this coming out the 60-plus page report saying
[08:12.240 --> 08:18.800]  lockdowns are a fraud and have killed more people than the virus and that the economic
[08:18.800 --> 08:22.960]  destruction of it is going to starve hundreds of millions of people to death which is true
[08:25.120 --> 08:29.920]  Reuters has come out and endorsed iver mechton and its incredible antiviral properties
[08:29.920 --> 08:37.040]  covering your little dirty asses aren't you the head of Reuters on the board of Pfizer
[08:37.040 --> 08:47.280]  and his quarterback the censorship jeff zucker the america hating at&t hatchet man for this country
[08:49.840 --> 08:56.640]  has now resigned and they always use the fall in the sword excuse of oh because he was having
[08:56.640 --> 09:01.920]  a relationship that was inappropriate with somebody that worked there yeah the big crime
[09:01.920 --> 09:07.440]  is men and women having sex and god forbid any children come along it wasn't lying it wasn't
[09:07.440 --> 09:12.400]  infiltrating groups it wasn't overseeing the persecution of millions of people that cnn would
[09:12.400 --> 09:19.760]  would covertly and overtly target and have deplatformed no no no no no no it's it's it's
[09:19.760 --> 09:25.360]  not quomo and his brother that worked at cnn knowingly sending sick patients into hospitals
[09:25.360 --> 09:32.960]  to kill 20 000 people and then suppressing it no no that's not the crime the crime's not defunding
[09:32.960 --> 09:38.800]  the police the crime's not opening up the violent people out of the prisons and having five-fold
[09:38.800 --> 09:43.920]  homicide and carjacking numbers explode in blue cities a doubling nationwide on average
[09:45.520 --> 09:49.760]  spilling over into communities that aren't run by psychotic leftists but still we pay
[09:49.760 --> 10:01.040]  the wheels are coming off the house of cards is collapsing the new world order is in deep
[10:01.680 --> 10:09.280]  deep deep deep trouble they knew their system was going down they knew it was a Ponzi scheme
[10:09.280 --> 10:14.480]  and they wanted to pose as the saviors when their Ponzi scheme went down so they wouldn't go to jail
[10:14.480 --> 10:21.600]  like Bernie Madoff but instead all over the world leaders are standing up in government in industry
[10:21.600 --> 10:29.040]  and in media and academia and in the clergy and just common people on the street at city council
[10:29.040 --> 10:37.360]  and school board meetings and are calling it out and the public is rapidly getting up to speed on
[10:37.360 --> 10:45.840]  the great reset the new world order and the divide and conquer strategy now before we get too excited
[10:45.840 --> 10:52.720]  about this and i got some big old chills going up and down my spine holy ghost likes it when we hit
[10:52.720 --> 11:00.800]  right on the truth you better know these people aren't going to give up and they're going to
[11:00.800 --> 11:04.800]  stage false flags and blame it on people and they're going to go blow up and shoot up black
[11:04.800 --> 11:08.720]  churches they're going to go shoot up gay bars and they're going to blame it on us
[11:12.000 --> 11:17.200]  and they're going to start war with russia and they are going to try to gut our economy as
[11:17.200 --> 11:21.040]  fast as they can because they know they're going down and they want to take us down with them
[11:23.360 --> 11:29.200]  and so that's where we are right now ladies and gentlemen and i can tell you just like
[11:29.200 --> 11:34.560]  happened last year in february it was officially in the texas record four days before the power
[11:34.560 --> 11:45.680]  went off on valentine's day they the texas railroad commission and the texas energy department
[11:45.680 --> 11:52.560]  sent a letter to the feds and joe biden said can we please up the power and all at our coal power
[11:52.560 --> 11:59.520]  and our gas plants the windmills can't supply the power and they said no you may not and the power
[11:59.520 --> 12:06.400]  went off and they have refused all the major gas companies forget coal they're not even
[12:06.400 --> 12:10.960]  requesting it a couple coal plants could give us all the extra power we needed but as another big
[12:10.960 --> 12:17.520]  blue northern polar vortex descends on the midwest and then towards texas
[12:20.800 --> 12:28.400]  we're being told we can't up our power again and it's even in cbs news but our leaders are so
[12:28.400 --> 12:33.360]  adult and the general public is so ignorant about how infrastructure works by design that's been done
[12:33.360 --> 12:37.840]  that most people don't have a diesel generator like we do that we had to put in a great expense
[12:37.840 --> 12:43.360]  to run this whole place when our little generators failed last year we were barely on air but kept
[12:43.360 --> 12:52.800]  on air with one light one feed one backup and i will have to sit here if the power goes off again
[12:52.800 --> 13:01.120]  tomorrow and watch the media ring its hands and people not have power and people die asking why
[13:01.120 --> 13:06.720]  the damn power is off when on record it's the globalist they're doing everything they turned
[13:06.720 --> 13:12.000]  the damn keystone pipeline off the day it was supposed to open as a sick joke
[13:12.000 --> 13:20.560]  and what's happening with this type of attack and siege on us that's what the great reset is
[13:23.680 --> 13:28.720]  is emblematic of how these people operate and how for the mere fact that we're ignorant about
[13:28.720 --> 13:32.480]  how they operate they're able to get away with this in plain view because when you
[13:32.480 --> 13:36.640]  have are wearing the spiritual glasses and then the glasses are being aware and researched
[13:36.640 --> 13:40.480]  it's like they live you see every damn thing they're doing and you're sitting over the general
[13:40.480 --> 13:47.600]  public you don't have the glasses and they have no idea like they're blind what's going on so
[13:47.600 --> 13:54.160]  let me give you the big kahuna and when i talk about this i start getting chills up down my spine
[13:54.160 --> 13:59.760]  because my spirit my gut my intellect knows i'm over the target and it's not hard to be over the
[13:59.760 --> 14:13.040]  target claus Schwab that murderous criminal hitler 5.0 has been drooling and giddy and giggling
[14:16.720 --> 14:23.600]  with how there's going to be a giant terrorist who takes on the power and to be terrible but
[14:23.600 --> 14:33.280]  this will help the earth will make covid look like happy time and they're going to cyber attack us
[14:35.120 --> 14:39.600]  if they think they can get away with it and if they think that they won't get caught and if
[14:39.600 --> 14:43.600]  they think you're stupid they're gonna pull it maybe next week maybe next month maybe next year
[14:43.600 --> 14:48.480]  but they've they've got their finger on the red button because why even if it comes out later
[14:48.480 --> 14:56.080]  they know they control the federal police forces of every major western nation same ones in brazil
[14:56.080 --> 15:00.960]  are trying to put ball scenario a damn hero in prison right now survived massive scabbing attacks
[15:00.960 --> 15:05.040]  everything else they're they're trying to put him in prison the u.n wants to try and for war crimes
[15:05.040 --> 15:10.800]  for giving people ivermectin on record they're preparing war crime charges genocide charges
[15:10.800 --> 15:20.080]  because they don't control their fbi we don't control our fbi we are literally run by criminal
[15:20.080 --> 15:26.880]  lawyers that sold us out to psychos like george soros and claus Schwab even though these lawyers
[15:26.880 --> 15:31.280]  and people in dc are going to lose their country and their children's future and they're having
[15:31.280 --> 15:35.680]  heart attacks and they're having strokes from the shots but they don't care they dutifully like it's
[15:35.680 --> 15:44.240]  they dutifully like it's a suicide pack carry this out like ss soldiers in 1944 knowing they
[15:44.240 --> 15:48.080]  were going to lose their country knowing they would lose tens of millions of more people
[15:48.080 --> 15:53.440]  knowing that they could not win but just having to follow hitler's orders to the end
[15:54.880 --> 15:58.320]  that's what's happening to us so get ready claus Schwab's gonna kill you

[22:00.560 --> 22:06.240]  me this last night and i spent about an hour watching videos of this guy so i sent it over
[22:06.240 --> 22:10.160]  to paul when i went to bed about midnight i said please write about this in the early morning and
[22:10.160 --> 22:14.880]  there's six hours ahead of us so six seven eight hours later this article was up and and the reason
[22:14.880 --> 22:19.840]  i name dropped the joe rogan thing is it's just that's kind of a hat tip to where i get so many of
[22:19.840 --> 22:24.720]  my some it's like the circle is now complete you know like used to i would send joe the stuff and now
[22:24.720 --> 22:31.920]  he sends me the stuff uh and uh but i'm gonna talk about this coming up next segment sonny professor
[22:32.560 --> 22:39.920]  says it's a mistake to think about pedophilia as being wrong now i love paul when i sent paul
[22:39.920 --> 22:45.200]  watson a message in the middle of the night to please write an article about this i said by
[22:45.200 --> 22:51.280]  the way the angle is that he said sex with one-year-olds is good but i guess that just seemed too
[22:51.280 --> 22:56.000]  hardcore for paul i said will you please write an article that how he says it's okay to have sex with
[22:56.000 --> 23:02.800]  one-year-olds we have the clip he said this on the internet in front of students he writes books
[23:02.800 --> 23:15.920]  about it i'm gonna say that again sex with one-year-olds is good yes it's good and he has a bunch of
[23:15.920 --> 23:21.760]  other professors agreeing with him and of course they all look like brian stelter i'm not saying
[23:21.760 --> 23:26.480]  brian stelter is a pedophile i'm saying he looks like one i mean they all look at this guy he doesn't
[23:26.480 --> 23:33.760]  seem weird look like brian stelter has okay i mean these are some creepy bastards i mean would you
[23:33.760 --> 23:40.560]  have these guys keep your five-year-old daughter or son uh no i mean they all got the look folks
[23:40.560 --> 23:46.960]  and they're well you know celebrating how much courage they've got to talk about how one-year-olds
[23:46.960 --> 23:53.040]  it's you know good for them to have some money have sex with them so got that for you coming up
[23:53.040 --> 24:02.480]  remember that germany in one city alone gave 30 000 plus children to live with men ages three and
[24:02.480 --> 24:07.520]  up to be gang raped and then they were shipped around and sold to other men to gang rape them
[24:08.080 --> 24:14.720]  until their intestines hung out of their body that's liberal that's trendy that's loving
[24:14.720 --> 24:23.680]  okay and we told you about this years ago and now they've got articles about it in new yorker magazine
[24:23.760 --> 24:31.840]  cps family court judges in germany starting in the late 60s under a cia mind control program
[24:31.840 --> 24:37.120]  to create the new system of love where boys are with men and girls are with women who rape them
[24:38.160 --> 24:43.120]  because you don't want any type of cross sex because then men might be attracted and abuse
[24:43.120 --> 24:47.680]  women later and but kids might come and god would get something good out of it so men with boys
[24:48.400 --> 24:55.680]  women with girls savagely raping them and then by age seven or eight when they're sex slave trained
[24:55.680 --> 25:02.160]  giving them to sex dungeons to be tortured now sounds a little unbelievable it's all in the news
[25:02.160 --> 25:12.240]  buried in the fine print the german government is run by satanic child torturers the german
[25:12.240 --> 25:18.880]  government was run by the west this was set up as an occupied zone as a training ground
[25:19.920 --> 25:25.920]  to then externalize the method in the uk and in france and in belgium and in spain and in the
[25:25.920 --> 25:30.720]  united states and canada and australia so when you look at the government government ministers
[25:31.920 --> 25:37.360]  i mean they admit macron was a sex slave and they say oh it's cute that at 12 he would go to the
[25:37.360 --> 25:42.320]  palace and have you know be part of gang you know you group sex that's typically iceberg folks
[25:43.680 --> 25:48.560]  so most of the people you see now you notice they don't have children the uu heads because the
[25:48.560 --> 25:57.360]  majority of uu heads were involved in child sex slavery and torture as the recipients as the
[25:57.360 --> 26:04.800]  victims and then as victimizers so this is multi-generational a new family we have thousands
[26:04.800 --> 26:12.560]  of pages of documents and you've got bf skinnered and all the rest of these people and kenzie who
[26:12.560 --> 26:22.720]  wrote books about the love of you know raping until you're old and they call it sexual liberation
[26:22.720 --> 26:32.960]  oh it's so liberal so when you see leftist controllers why do you think seeing it has
[26:32.960 --> 26:39.040]  had a bunch of people busted trying to run sex trafficking it's not like you go to the bar and
[26:39.040 --> 26:43.280]  you got game you take a you know hot chicken or something like that guys got game with the left
[26:43.280 --> 26:52.480]  you got game when you pipped the kids out the whole mission is expanding the cult of child rape
[26:54.000 --> 27:00.080]  what are the what are the cnn the different cnn indicted people in just the last few months
[27:00.080 --> 27:05.520]  say to the women i want to train your daughter your seven-year-old as a sex slave we're going to
[27:05.520 --> 27:12.880]  make a lot of money with her to elites every obscene had to get massages and complained
[27:12.880 --> 27:17.360]  that he had to have sex with up to a hundred girls a week trying them out for the men he
[27:17.360 --> 27:25.120]  was going to be supplying them to industrial level satanism so when you see the heads of
[27:25.120 --> 27:32.400]  these it companies and when you see these congressmen and people and when you see all of these people
[27:34.480 --> 27:43.120]  they rape children they kill children they have more respect for a filet mignon they're going to
[27:43.120 --> 27:46.960]  eat and the cow they killed then they do your children in fact it's not as they don't care about
[27:46.960 --> 27:54.000]  your kids they want to hurt your kids they want to rape your children and if they can't stick

[28:02.080 --> 28:07.120]  if they can't do that they're going to inject them with deadly poison that mutates their bodies
[28:07.120 --> 28:14.000]  and attacks their dna for multi generations but god will deliver us from the civil it's all about
[28:14.000 --> 28:19.120]  raping and next segment i'm going to lay it out remember they wouldn't let people see old folks
[28:19.120 --> 28:24.880]  while they murdered them all over the world under human control in the nursing homes well

[33:56.800 --> 34:04.800]  not veers veirs but right from the hospitals right from the files and of course it's exactly what the
[34:04.800 --> 34:11.440]  FDA knew and the cdc back in october 2020 before the single injection was given they knew exactly
[34:11.440 --> 34:18.160]  what it would do and there it is on screen and the enemies of freedom over at cnn and the other
[34:18.160 --> 34:25.760]  pedophile mouthpieces the other vampire mouthpieces that's what they are psychic vampires they just
[34:25.760 --> 34:32.000]  use words like oh the discredited disinformation but they never say what the disinformation is
[34:32.000 --> 34:38.480]  they never show you what they're talking about like we do they lie to you
[34:41.440 --> 34:47.280]  so let's tie the covid revolution of tyranny and the moves to take the children away and take the
[34:47.280 --> 34:52.160]  old people away to protect them in the shield program the cdc's got ready that's right out of
[34:52.160 --> 34:56.720]  the un people say how did you know they'd do this two years ago because it's in the un plan
[34:57.280 --> 35:03.120]  dr ryan the head of their rapid reaction force wrote the book on it for all the governments
[35:03.120 --> 35:10.400]  following un orders the uc headlines oh yahoo news reports that the young man who had a heart attack
[35:10.400 --> 35:15.840]  the collegiate athlete his daughter did say the vaccine caused it but still the un group said
[35:15.840 --> 35:22.000]  that you're not allowed to say that so we took his video down off instagram now because uh he the un
[35:22.000 --> 35:32.960]  said you just wake up and the un says they never say what your disinformation is because it's not
[35:32.960 --> 35:39.920]  disinformation so let's talk about just another window into these people we've seen the new york
[35:39.920 --> 35:46.160]  times the washington post us a today in the last month all indoor sex with children and say it's
[35:46.160 --> 35:51.840]  the new liberation really can children sign up for credit cards can children go in and buy liquor
[35:51.840 --> 35:57.200]  and cigarettes can children go into pornography shops can children join the military the answer
[35:57.200 --> 36:02.320]  is no because they haven't developed enough of the life skill to be able to make those decisions
[36:02.320 --> 36:07.360]  in every culture in every system you're in the nest till you're 15 16 years old
[36:07.360 --> 36:13.440]  yeah you can say they've extended it out to 18 we have arrested development endless childhood you
[36:13.440 --> 36:19.040]  could argue okay are the jews right that you're bar mitzvah's at 13 i think if you raise somebody
[36:19.040 --> 36:24.640]  to be an adult by 13 some might be but the way our society operates yeah 18's about right
[36:26.640 --> 36:33.440]  18's about right i mean i've got a four-year-old daughter i've got a 13-year-old daughter i've
[36:33.440 --> 36:40.240]  got a 17-year-old daughter and do i want somebody having the right to come and say hey i i'm a big
[36:40.240 --> 36:46.160]  fat pedophile i want access to your to your 17-year-old daughter your four-year-old daughter
[36:46.160 --> 36:52.320]  or your 13-year-old daughter the answer is hell no these are my children they belong to me not the
[36:52.320 --> 36:59.200]  state and not you freaks not all you weird creepy sick men who are threatened by full-grown women
[36:59.200 --> 37:04.080]  and the responsibility and the power of it and all of it you want little children that you can
[37:04.080 --> 37:09.440]  lord over and have power over and screw up their lives and hurt their bodies and statistically
[37:09.440 --> 37:14.320]  there are dozens of times we're not going to be on drugs and in the sex trade or to commit suicide
[37:14.320 --> 37:19.440]  but you left this love death and if you can't kill that baby before it's born you want to wreck their
[37:19.440 --> 37:30.160]  life that's why MSNBC says your kids belong to us that's a quote all your kids belong to us so
[37:30.160 --> 37:38.080]  here it is ladies and gentlemen su ny professor it's a mistake to think pedophilia is wrong
[37:39.200 --> 37:44.880]  yeah that's a pretty hardcore headline by paul watson but you know in a way it's not because
[37:44.880 --> 37:53.680]  he goes on to say evolutionarily you know sex with one-year-olds is fine oh really is that
[37:53.680 --> 38:04.800]  why no mammals have sex with the species when it's not of age and releases the hormones and the
[38:04.800 --> 38:13.680]  pheromones i mean of course you don't see eagles in the eagles nest raping their baby eagles you
[38:13.680 --> 38:23.360]  don't see daddy whales coming over and raping the newborn baby whale only sick demonic leftists are
[38:23.360 --> 38:30.320]  like this and so this is their coming out now remember the members of the services require
[38:30.320 --> 38:34.880]  we're coming for your children we're recruiting them you will never stop us
[38:34.880 --> 38:44.720]  us they all that weird zombie craze look in their eyes su ny professor it's a mistake to
[38:44.720 --> 38:50.320]  think pedophilia is wrong and he goes on he's talking about the evolutionary advantage yeah
[38:50.320 --> 38:55.920]  what do you think went on in germany with the 30 000 kids just in one area alone being given by
[38:55.920 --> 39:06.000]  the state from christian families two convicted pedophiles to form the new family men raping boys
[39:07.520 --> 39:13.360]  women raping girls and that's the new family that then goes out and recruits and keeps doing it
[39:13.360 --> 39:17.520]  and then they put them into government put them into offices and they can trust they're gonna do
[39:17.520 --> 39:23.360]  exactly whatever they're told and you've got blues clues now if you look with mollock with
[39:23.360 --> 39:29.200]  children being sacrificed to it with what is a woman now it's a big fat gross man
[39:30.000 --> 39:36.320]  dressed like a woman and that's what children are taught a woman is the woman that loves you and
[39:36.320 --> 39:41.280]  takes care of you and cooks food for you and reads books to you is now a big fat aggressive
[39:41.280 --> 39:56.080]  demonic man and at the end of the day what do they want they want death uh and we sit there and we
[39:56.080 --> 40:01.920]  put up with it we let them have access to our children so i call this guy the renfield type
[40:03.040 --> 40:09.760]  again it's all an archetype you've got count Dracula and he's royalty from the carpathian
[40:09.760 --> 40:17.520]  mountains and he moves to London because they all knew that the sax cobra gothers were Romanian
[40:17.520 --> 40:28.880]  Hungarian not even german and so it's all that archetype and he sleeps under the church but at
[40:28.880 --> 40:36.000]  night he brings babies to be bled out for his mistresses for his women that are the daughters
[40:36.000 --> 40:40.560]  of the nobility that he is recruited into his coven and then they have a black Sabbath where they
[40:42.560 --> 40:48.880]  where they drink the blood of the children but he drinks the blood of the goddess he kills the
[40:48.880 --> 40:57.120]  mother and in turn the mother feeds on the child so they must first take the woman over and the
[40:57.120 --> 41:02.640]  image of a woman is now a demonic man eating a baby in front of you and this is what children are
[41:02.640 --> 41:10.480]  shown and and what the culture shown as they transmute not led into gold but gold into poison
[41:10.480 --> 41:17.040]  the goddess that god gave us the power of regeneration and endless life and and the force
[41:17.040 --> 41:22.240]  of our people and our future and the power of men and women coming together in the office of the
[41:22.240 --> 41:30.720]  family and in the divine creation of new humans and inverting that and saying no we don't care about
[41:30.720 --> 41:35.360]  the children in fact we're going to feed on the children we're going to heat the hospitals with
[41:35.360 --> 41:39.680]  children and we're going to keep children alive and graft them into animals and torture them
[41:39.680 --> 41:45.200]  because we're god and we're selfish and we're bad and this is the world we're building that's ugly
[41:45.200 --> 41:53.920]  and stinking and fail but Dracula has Renfield who he's not fully turned into a vampire but a ghoul
[41:53.920 --> 42:02.400]  who eats rats and bugs but count Dracula promises him someday he'll make you because he turns the
[42:02.400 --> 42:07.600]  women into his servants to eat to destroy children but the men he wants weak and stunted and pathetic

[47:42.640 --> 47:47.200]  up at the start of the next hour, here in about 13, 14 minutes.
[47:47.200 --> 47:54.160]  Okay, so when I tell you that the Saxe Coburgophis are the line of Dracula, that's a fact.
[47:54.160 --> 47:55.160]  Pick it up.
[47:55.160 --> 47:59.680]  When I tell you that Jimmy Savelle had the highest level security clearance in the UK
[47:59.680 --> 48:04.640]  to go into any royal areas, anywhere he wanted, into the Queen of England's own chambers,
[48:04.640 --> 48:07.360]  no one could stop him.
[48:07.360 --> 48:12.400]  He was a Wrenfield of the highest order who had a sex dungeon where they killed kids.
[48:12.400 --> 48:14.800]  This came out in the news.
[48:14.800 --> 48:19.640]  And the government covered it up the entire time.
[48:19.640 --> 48:26.000]  There is Wrenfield in the Superman outfit and there is Baby Dracula.
[48:26.000 --> 48:31.520]  But if you want to know the King Daddy, he just went bye-bye.
[48:31.520 --> 48:35.880]  And that, of course, was Prince Philip's sworn to kill you and your family.
[48:35.880 --> 48:37.960]  On record, look it up.
[48:37.960 --> 48:44.320]  At least 80% of you is a deadly virus that you want to reincarnate as.
[48:44.320 --> 48:45.960]  So that's who these people are.
[48:45.960 --> 48:47.120]  Who runs Build Back Better?
[48:47.120 --> 48:48.720]  Who wants to cut your power off?
[48:48.720 --> 48:49.960]  Who wants to put these deadly shots?
[48:49.960 --> 48:54.000]  Who says it's a military campaign to save the earth from humans?
[48:54.000 --> 48:59.640]  Well, the literal heir of Count Dracula can't make that up.
[48:59.640 --> 49:00.640]  There's his daddy.
[49:00.640 --> 49:05.480]  Boy, don't need any makeup there to be in the new movie The Hunger.
[49:05.480 --> 49:09.800]  They might remake, I guess.
[49:09.800 --> 49:13.600]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[49:13.600 --> 49:14.600]  Now let's talk about the facts.
[49:14.600 --> 49:16.560]  Let's look at this little Wrenfield.
[49:16.560 --> 49:22.400]  A sunny professor is under investigation, that's an S-U-N-Y, after videoclips a merge
[49:22.400 --> 49:28.280]  of him asserting that it's a mistake to think pedophilia is wrong, that there are evolutionary
[49:28.280 --> 49:33.720]  advantages to child-adult sex.
[49:33.720 --> 49:35.700]  And he goes on from there.
[49:35.700 --> 49:43.640]  As part of his libertarian philosophy, Kirchner believes, Stephen Kirchner, that society's
[49:43.640 --> 49:46.080]  reaction to pedophilia is what's wrong.
[49:46.080 --> 49:47.080]  That's right.
[49:47.080 --> 49:52.360]  And he starts out with imagine an adult male wants to have sex with her 12-year-old daughter.
[49:52.360 --> 49:53.360]  If she wants it, it's okay.
[49:53.360 --> 49:55.880]  Yuck, is the school taught her to do it?
[49:55.880 --> 49:57.040]  Like, oh, you're five-year-old.
[49:57.040 --> 49:58.040]  We're teaching him.
[49:58.040 --> 49:59.040]  He's really a girl.
[49:59.040 --> 50:03.440]  And by the time he's 10, we're going to cut his balls off, because hey, if they can't
[50:03.440 --> 50:08.200]  rape him outright, well, maybe they can convince us that we're just going to cut their genitals
[50:08.200 --> 50:09.200]  off.
[50:09.200 --> 50:12.600]  And if you don't like that, then you quote hate transgenders.
[50:12.600 --> 50:16.520]  No, if somebody thinks they're a woman and has that proclivity and they're of age, that's
[50:16.520 --> 50:17.520]  their right.
[50:17.520 --> 50:19.040]  And I'm not against them and don't hate them.
[50:19.040 --> 50:24.680]  But that's a far cry from people coming after children with these lies.
[50:24.680 --> 50:28.600]  And now it's like, oh, we can convince your 12-year-old, and they go on to say, and if
[50:28.600 --> 50:33.760]  your one-year-old is consenting, oh, I saw that one-year-old in the backyard and just
[50:33.760 --> 50:37.760]  had to put him in the back of my van, because, you know, that one-year-old really looked
[50:37.760 --> 50:42.720]  at me like, wink, wink, and wanted it.
[50:42.720 --> 50:44.760]  That's the craziness of the left, folks.
[50:44.760 --> 50:45.760]  That's how their minds work.
[50:45.760 --> 50:49.200]  It was like a Daily Mail article about me like four or five years ago.
[50:49.200 --> 50:53.600]  And it was a former employee here, and they said, well, Jones never made any homosexual
[50:53.600 --> 50:58.080]  advances, but he could tell that I wanted to.
[50:58.080 --> 51:01.760]  I mean, just think about that.
[51:01.760 --> 51:02.760]  And I'm not comparing that to this.
[51:02.760 --> 51:05.160]  I'm saying that's another example of, I never said anything to you.
[51:05.160 --> 51:09.160]  I never, you were here 14 years, but I was grooming you, okay?
[51:09.160 --> 51:14.520]  Well, this guy, these guys are saying, oh, I saw the one-year-old at the mall in the
[51:14.520 --> 51:17.440]  baby stroller, and it wanted me.
[51:17.440 --> 51:28.000]  And your parents don't have any right to say, oh, no, you can't court my one-year-old.
[51:28.000 --> 51:34.160]  And then you look at the evil, look on this, he looks, I mean, like, look, he looks as
[51:34.160 --> 51:35.800]  big a pedophile to me.
[51:35.800 --> 51:36.800]  He doesn't just sing.
[51:36.800 --> 51:40.160]  He likes, you know, it's a wonderful thing, you know, the best thing.
[51:40.160 --> 51:41.160]  It's a good thing, evolutionary.
[51:41.160 --> 51:42.160]  No, no, no.
[51:42.160 --> 51:44.160]  But I mean, is he creepier than Brian Skelter?
[51:44.160 --> 51:46.600]  I think we may have someone that actually tops it.
[51:46.600 --> 51:48.160]  I mean, does he not give you the willies?
[51:48.160 --> 51:57.160]  I mean, does the hair on the back of your neck not absolutely just stand up when you
[51:57.160 --> 51:59.320]  think about this guy's talking about your children?
[51:59.320 --> 52:00.880]  He's not going out and getting a woman.
[52:00.880 --> 52:01.880]  He's not working hard.
[52:01.880 --> 52:03.200]  He's not changing diapers.
[52:03.200 --> 52:05.440]  He's not up with kids when they're sick at 2 a.m.
[52:05.440 --> 52:06.880]  He's not taking them fishing.
[52:06.880 --> 52:09.360]  He's not loving on them when they're scared at night.
[52:09.360 --> 52:15.840]  He's just talking about how it's good for them to have a man stick his penis in them.
[52:15.840 --> 52:19.240]  And our parents better back off and shut up.
[52:19.240 --> 52:21.320]  And the schools are teaching white kids they're evil.
[52:21.320 --> 52:23.600]  And the schools are teaching kids America sucks.
[52:23.600 --> 52:26.040]  And the schools are teaching kids they can be another gender.
[52:26.040 --> 52:31.000]  All of it is a war on humanity period.
[52:31.000 --> 52:36.080]  And now Australia is joining Canada saying, oh, if you're unvaccinated, your kid goes
[52:36.080 --> 52:37.080]  to the doctor.
[52:37.080 --> 52:38.680]  You can't come in the doctor's office.
[52:38.680 --> 52:40.040]  You can't come in the school.
[52:40.040 --> 52:41.920]  You can't come in the emergency room.
[52:41.920 --> 52:45.640]  All about the state saying, your children belong to us.
[52:45.640 --> 52:49.640]  And now the rapists are telling people in court, I identify as a child.
[52:49.640 --> 52:53.400]  Oh, well, then we're going to sentence you to a juvenile home.
[52:53.400 --> 52:54.900]  You rape children.
[52:54.900 --> 52:55.900]  You're 23 years old.
[52:55.900 --> 53:00.880]  We're going to sentence you to four years in a juvenile home or two years.
[53:00.880 --> 53:01.880]  These aren't jokes.
[53:01.880 --> 53:06.880]  That's why there's these big movements with big fat pedophiles.
[53:06.880 --> 53:07.880]  They're always big fat guys.
[53:07.880 --> 53:09.720]  I don't know why.
[53:09.720 --> 53:14.880]  And they're always like, I identify as a five year old and I mean, look at this dude.
[53:14.880 --> 53:21.440]  Look just like Jeffrey Epstein and look at that greedy, hateful, selfish look.
[53:21.440 --> 53:22.440]  So here, let's hear from him.
[53:22.440 --> 53:24.480]  There's a bunch of the clips on m4wars.com.
[53:24.480 --> 53:25.480]  It's hard to listen to.
[53:25.480 --> 53:28.960]  Here he is drooling over how wonderful it is.
[53:28.960 --> 53:29.960]  Here it is.
[53:29.960 --> 53:32.200]  So there's a couple of things to say here.
[53:32.200 --> 53:35.680]  One is even if you are looking for a threshold, let's say there's a threshold.
[53:35.680 --> 53:38.720]  I'm making this number up, but let's say it's at age eight.
[53:38.720 --> 53:42.960]  Still, that tells you that some adult child sex is permissible.
[53:42.960 --> 53:49.720]  Second, the notion that it's wrong, even one of the one year old is not quite obvious
[53:49.720 --> 53:50.720]  to me.
[53:50.720 --> 53:56.000]  There are reports in some cultures of grandmothers filading their baby boys to calm them down
[53:56.000 --> 53:57.000]  when a colic.
[53:57.000 --> 54:00.520]  Now, I don't know if this is true, but this is sort of why they report it as a program.
[54:00.520 --> 54:01.520]  But you're telling us.
[54:01.520 --> 54:02.520]  At least one culture.
[54:02.520 --> 54:05.920]  And it working that the grandmothers believe that this actually works.
[54:05.920 --> 54:09.080]  If this were to be true, and again, I don't know it to be true.
[54:09.080 --> 54:12.600]  If it were to be true, it's hard to see what would be wrong with it.
[54:12.600 --> 54:18.320]  So yeah, I guess I think, no, I don't think there's a blanket period beyond which this
[54:18.320 --> 54:20.200]  is permissible.
[54:20.200 --> 54:24.800]  If we're interested in willing participation, which is the way I structured it, then yeah,
[54:24.800 --> 54:28.400]  there's a point below which people aren't willing participants in anything because they
[54:28.400 --> 54:32.960]  don't have intentions or they don't have the sort of mental states that allow for willing
[54:32.960 --> 54:34.460]  participation.
[54:34.460 --> 54:37.680]  But no, I don't I don't think it's blanket wrong at any age.
[54:37.680 --> 54:38.680]  Imagine that.
[54:38.680 --> 54:39.680]  Shut up for a minute.
[54:39.680 --> 54:40.680]  That's enough for now.
[54:40.680 --> 54:42.160]  Look, you went up.
[54:42.160 --> 54:47.440]  There's a lot of this, folks, like I had like nightmares about it last night.
[54:47.440 --> 54:53.040]  I woke up just just asking myself, how do I get on air and explain people how big this
[54:53.040 --> 54:54.040]  is?
[54:54.040 --> 54:57.720]  We had about 30,000 kids in one region of Germany given to pedophiles to be gang raped
[54:57.720 --> 55:02.440]  and then they were taken to giant gang rape events inside Catholic churches because that's
[55:02.440 --> 55:06.480]  what Satanists want to do is desecrate things and then and then we're lines of nuns and
[55:06.480 --> 55:10.560]  priests would rape little boys and girls and then beat them and then they would come back
[55:10.560 --> 55:14.280]  bloody and their intestines hanging out of their rear ends.
[55:14.280 --> 55:16.280]  I mean, this is real.
[55:16.280 --> 55:17.280]  Okay.
[55:17.280 --> 55:22.400]  I mean, this is who these people are and they're taking over the Boy Scouts and the Catholic
[55:22.400 --> 55:24.840]  Church and the universities and the elementary schools.
[55:24.840 --> 55:28.440]  Remember Jocelyn Elders, Bill Clinton's surgeon general nominee that said, I remember the
[55:28.440 --> 55:29.440]  tape.
[55:29.440 --> 55:33.320]  It's hard to find out there like, oh, but we need to master bake the little boys and
[55:33.320 --> 55:37.920]  girls reach down and help them and you just heard him.
[55:37.920 --> 55:44.680]  We need grandmas to give to rape their babies.
[55:44.680 --> 55:49.240]  Grandmas need to rape the babies because they like it.
[55:49.240 --> 55:54.480]  I mean, I mean, it's literally imagine Linda Blair.
[55:54.480 --> 55:58.320]  People thought it was shocking in the in the late seventies where she says, your mother's
[55:58.320 --> 56:02.560]  you know, what in in hell, it was also frightening.
[56:02.560 --> 56:06.720]  They're on TV, the surgeon general saying, look, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna
[56:06.720 --> 56:09.720]  rape your babies.
[56:09.720 --> 56:12.760]  This guy's like grandma's gonna suck your babies off.
[56:12.760 --> 56:16.360]  I mean, folks, they're just gonna vomit their evil on us.
[56:16.360 --> 56:19.880]  They're never gonna stop until they all go to prison.
[56:19.880 --> 56:22.800]  We got a major pedophile demon problem here.
[56:22.800 --> 56:23.800]  Okay.
[56:23.800 --> 56:27.800]  It's happened in every other culture, repeated itself again, and these people are coming
[56:27.800 --> 56:29.840]  after me because they know I know who they are.
[56:29.840 --> 56:33.840]  That's why we need money to fight these monsters and the Democratic Party and all their armies.
[56:33.840 --> 56:34.840]  That's what I'm fighting.
[56:34.840 --> 56:35.840]  Pedophiles.
[56:35.840 --> 56:36.840]  Period.
[56:36.840 --> 56:37.840]  That's who runs them.
[56:37.840 --> 56:39.340]  That's who I face.
[56:39.340 --> 56:41.680]  And I can't beat these vampires without your help.
[56:41.680 --> 56:44.160]  So go to infowarstore.com.

[59:36.640 --> 59:39.920]  I've given it to my parents as gifts, way out the middle of nowhere where regular phones
[59:39.920 --> 59:47.520]  don't work, they work, infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1029-4195-1020 and ask the Alex Jones
[59:47.520 --> 59:51.240]  Special.
[59:51.240 --> 1:00:03.320]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:03.320 --> 1:00:09.520]  Welcome back to this special Wednesday, February 2nd transmission.
[1:00:09.520 --> 1:00:18.920]  MTG, Marjorie Taylor Greene, is going to be joining us coming up in the next segment,
[1:00:18.920 --> 1:00:22.000]  and then she'll stay the whole hour if she can unless a vote gets called, as Pelosi's
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  been moving votes around.
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:26.160]  So that's coming up, but first I want to play a very important report that really hits
[1:00:26.160 --> 1:00:36.200]  the heart of what's happening, here it is.
[1:00:36.200 --> 1:00:41.760]  The fifth column recently published findings and conclusions on the strange, selfishly
[1:00:41.760 --> 1:00:49.320]  nanotech they discovered in the Pfizer mRNA vaccines via optical microscopy analysis.
[1:00:49.320 --> 1:00:55.080]  The objects they found in the vaccine correspond with known items in the scientific record,
[1:00:55.080 --> 1:01:00.360]  and the conclusion they come to seems quite clear, that the well-documented scientific
[1:01:00.360 --> 1:01:06.760]  goal to use nanotechnology in living human beings to form networks capable of controlling
[1:01:06.760 --> 1:01:14.120]  several nanomachines is currently being deployed in the COVID-19 vaccines, which amounts to
[1:01:14.120 --> 1:01:19.440]  the most intrusive assault against humanity in all of recorded history.
[1:01:19.440 --> 1:01:24.000]  While the media and government lie in cover for big pharma, the official ingredients are
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  still unknown.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:32.280]  But we have thousands of brilliant scientists worldwide studying these experimental vaccines.
[1:01:32.280 --> 1:01:38.840]  Some have died in highly suspicious ways, but most have been able to share their findings.
[1:01:38.840 --> 1:01:44.000]  And the work shows us that graphene oxide is a key component in all of this.
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:49.240]  There have been dozens of official documented studies on the use of graphene oxide related
[1:01:49.240 --> 1:01:52.640]  to how we see it being used here today.
[1:01:52.640 --> 1:01:58.880]  Among other things, as a power converter, graphene, a one atom thick layer of hexagonally
[1:01:58.880 --> 1:02:04.880]  arranged carbon atoms, is the thinnest and strongest material known to man, and an outstanding
[1:02:04.880 --> 1:02:07.560]  conductor of heat and electricity.
[1:02:07.560 --> 1:02:14.040]  It can boost gigahertz frequencies into terahertz, which is exactly what these new nanotech machines
[1:02:14.040 --> 1:02:16.080]  need for power.
[1:02:16.080 --> 1:02:21.000]  In order to do this, the graphene first needs a frequency to power it.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:26.960]  And the optimal frequency to externally power graphene is known to be 26 gigahertz, which
[1:02:26.960 --> 1:02:30.720]  is also the frequency put out by 5G.
[1:02:30.720 --> 1:02:36.240]  In this model, the graphene within the body is activated by microwave signals in the gigahertz
[1:02:36.240 --> 1:02:42.960]  range, which it then boosts into the terahertz range, which then powers the novel nanotech
[1:02:42.960 --> 1:02:47.760]  machinery to self-assemble within the human body.
[1:02:47.760 --> 1:02:51.600]  Once assembled, what do these nanotech machines do?
[1:02:51.600 --> 1:02:57.040]  The images compared to the scientific literature suggest that they are the foundation of an
[1:02:57.040 --> 1:03:02.680]  internal electronic system with an endless potential for biomanipulation of the human
[1:03:02.680 --> 1:03:04.320]  host.
[1:03:04.320 --> 1:03:09.520]  Nano-routers that emit MAC addresses able to be registered via Bluetooth.
[1:03:09.520 --> 1:03:12.960]  Nano and plasma antennas to amplify signals.
[1:03:12.960 --> 1:03:19.160]  Nano-rectennas acting as rectifier bridges from AC to DC current, codecs and logic gates
[1:03:19.160 --> 1:03:21.880]  for encryption of communication.
[1:03:21.880 --> 1:03:26.960]  The raw material for all this self-assembly is also graphene oxide, and when we compare
[1:03:26.960 --> 1:03:32.840]  known side effects of graphene oxide to the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines, we
[1:03:32.840 --> 1:03:35.400]  find them to be the same.
[1:03:35.400 --> 1:03:41.000]  Once graphene oxide is injected into the body, it acquires magnetic properties, predictably
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:45.280]  around the injection site, the heart and the brain.
[1:03:45.280 --> 1:03:49.920]  Graphene is seen as a pathogen by our immune system and will often result in paralysis
[1:03:49.920 --> 1:03:51.720]  and stroke.
[1:03:51.720 --> 1:03:55.800]  Graphene is known to cause blood clots and heart conditions.
[1:03:55.800 --> 1:04:01.240]  Graphene oxide can generate small discharges causing cardiac arrhythmia.
[1:04:01.240 --> 1:04:05.800]  There is so much going on with these experimental vaccines, and the evidence seems clear that
[1:04:05.800 --> 1:04:12.520]  there is a mass experiment going on, with certain batches marked more deadly than others,
[1:04:12.520 --> 1:04:18.560]  and with certain batches that contain a bold new technology akin to a man-made parasite
[1:04:18.560 --> 1:04:24.840]  intended to control the host human if it doesn't kill them first in the process.
[1:04:24.840 --> 1:04:30.600]  Perhaps that is what the mad scientists and psychopaths are after, human genetics that
[1:04:30.600 --> 1:04:35.400]  can withstand this new invasive and deadly nano-tech.
[1:04:35.400 --> 1:04:38.000]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:46.200]  All right folks, we just connected with Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, really looking forward
[1:04:46.200 --> 1:04:47.200]  to this interview.
[1:04:47.200 --> 1:04:50.000]  We're going to come back in 60 seconds for everybody to know.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:59.560]  However, you're listening, tune in and share the live link to get past the sensors.
[1:04:59.560 --> 1:05:03.760]  Sold out for months, X3 is now back in stock.
[1:05:03.760 --> 1:05:07.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing, our products are game changing,
[1:05:07.880 --> 1:05:11.120]  and so many people are deficient in iodine.
[1:05:11.120 --> 1:05:16.760]  It's not the soil anymore, most of the ocean is contaminated, but when you get high quality
[1:05:16.760 --> 1:05:22.120]  triiodine, all three of the healthy types together, it does amazing things for your
[1:05:22.120 --> 1:05:26.080]  stamina, your libido, but most importantly your immune system.
[1:05:26.080 --> 1:05:32.040]  So, X3, the only triiodine on the market, highest grade, is now exclusively available
[1:05:32.040 --> 1:05:35.720]  again at 50%off at infowarsshore.com.
[1:05:35.720 --> 1:05:39.560]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body, it takes about
[1:05:39.560 --> 1:05:43.920]  two weeks to get it on average, you really need to experience X3.
[1:05:43.920 --> 1:05:46.760]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.
[1:05:46.760 --> 1:05:50.800]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing
[1:05:50.800 --> 1:05:54.200]  what it does for your body, it's the good halogen, not the bad halogen, and it funds
[1:05:54.200 --> 1:05:56.480]  the Infowar, a true 360 win.
[1:05:56.480 --> 1:06:04.600]  So again, X3, back in stock, 50%off.
[1:06:04.600 --> 1:06:08.800]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[1:06:08.800 --> 1:06:14.600]  Resistance to Titans is obedience to God, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:14.600 --> 1:06:22.600]  Well, there's a lot of great new people the last few years that have gotten into Congress
[1:06:22.600 --> 1:06:27.160]  for defending this Republic, but out of all of them, the most informative and interesting
[1:06:27.160 --> 1:06:30.840]  and brave has got to be Marjorie Taylor Green.
[1:06:30.840 --> 1:06:36.280]  I really appreciate her joining us because, you know, CNN, MSNBC, they try to say people
[1:06:36.280 --> 1:06:37.280]  shouldn't interview her.
[1:06:37.280 --> 1:06:41.200]  They try to say she shouldn't be allowed to be on the Internet or be on shows.
[1:06:41.200 --> 1:06:45.200]  She should be banned, and she has been, and oh, you shouldn't talk to Alex Jones either.
[1:06:45.200 --> 1:06:50.640]  We should all be scared of each other as nationalists and as populists, but we're not, and we're
[1:06:50.640 --> 1:06:51.640]  coming together.
[1:06:51.640 --> 1:06:57.360]  CNN, on average, has 100,000 viewers, Joe Rogan, on average, 11 million conservatively.
[1:06:57.360 --> 1:06:59.520]  That's more than 20 times bigger.
[1:06:59.520 --> 1:07:02.520]  This show has over three to four million viewers conservatively a day.
[1:07:02.520 --> 1:07:03.520]  They're a joke.
[1:07:03.520 --> 1:07:04.520]  The people have spoken.
[1:07:04.520 --> 1:07:05.520]  They want freedom.
[1:07:05.520 --> 1:07:06.520]  They want justice.
[1:07:06.520 --> 1:07:13.520]  And now you have Zucker, the head of CNN, stepping down with the same fate as Cuomo and the rest.
[1:07:13.520 --> 1:07:19.760]  We also have Reuters coming out doing an article about, okay, big studies from Japan and Brazil
[1:07:19.760 --> 1:07:22.840]  and the U.S., Ivermectin really is a miracle drug.
[1:07:22.840 --> 1:07:26.720]  They've got egg on their face in so many ways, so she joins us as long as she can this hour.
[1:07:26.720 --> 1:07:28.840]  If a vote comes up, she's got to go.
[1:07:28.840 --> 1:07:30.120]  It's really amazing to have her here.
[1:07:30.120 --> 1:07:31.120]  We wanted to get her on for a while.
[1:07:31.120 --> 1:07:37.760]  We can find her on Get Her at MTG for America and on all the other great backup sites out
[1:07:37.760 --> 1:07:38.760]  there as well.
[1:07:38.760 --> 1:07:40.600]  And she's got a lot of topics.
[1:07:40.600 --> 1:07:43.680]  I asked her for a list and it's the same stuff I wanted to cover.
[1:07:43.680 --> 1:07:50.560]  Vax mandates, lockdowns, what's happened with the Jan 6 situation, Ukraine and so much more.
[1:07:50.560 --> 1:07:52.560]  So Congresswoman, thanks for joining us.
[1:07:52.560 --> 1:07:57.800]  Thanks so much for having me on, Alex, and I am a huge fan of yours, so I'm thrilled
[1:07:57.800 --> 1:07:58.800]  to be here.
[1:07:58.800 --> 1:07:59.800]  I'm a big fan of yours as well.
[1:07:59.800 --> 1:08:03.320]  I hope to meet you sometime in person.
[1:08:03.320 --> 1:08:04.320]  Where do you want to start?
[1:08:04.320 --> 1:08:08.320]  Maybe the state of the country, Biden, where things are going?
[1:08:08.320 --> 1:08:14.240]  Well, I'd basically like to let all of your viewers know that I'm the exact type of person
[1:08:14.240 --> 1:08:19.120]  they never wanted to be elected to Congress and to come to Washington.
[1:08:19.120 --> 1:08:24.280]  And the reason why is they have a system that runs here that has hurt our country for so
[1:08:24.280 --> 1:08:25.520]  long now.
[1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:29.800]  And they've completely sold America out and it's the uniparty that's the problem.
[1:08:29.800 --> 1:08:35.320]  It's the Republican rhinos who walk and talk and act like us and then they do different
[1:08:35.320 --> 1:08:40.320]  things behind closed doors with the way they vote and legislate and the people they take
[1:08:40.320 --> 1:08:41.320]  money from.
[1:08:41.320 --> 1:08:45.800]  And unfortunately, those Republicans have joined with the Democrats and it's been happening
[1:08:45.800 --> 1:08:50.800]  for a really long time, but they serve the globalist agenda and as a matter of fact today,
[1:08:50.800 --> 1:08:56.400]  I'm waiting to have to go vote here in just a little bit against the Compete's Act.
[1:08:56.400 --> 1:09:00.320]  And that's what Nancy Pelosi is bringing to the House floor today.
[1:09:00.320 --> 1:09:04.040]  She's working on getting that done while we're working through amendments.
[1:09:04.040 --> 1:09:06.400]  They don't want the Republican amendments to change it.
[1:09:06.400 --> 1:09:11.520]  And this is a so-called bill that's supposed to go against China and help America to compete,
[1:09:11.520 --> 1:09:16.440]  but the all honesty, the truth is it serves the climate change radical agenda.
[1:09:16.440 --> 1:09:22.400]  It serves China first and America last and it's all build back better and green new deal
[1:09:22.400 --> 1:09:27.280]  just rewritten into something that she lies and calls America Compete's Act.
[1:09:27.280 --> 1:09:32.320]  So it's the same song and dance, but it's Mitch McConnell and the Lindsey Graham's and
[1:09:32.320 --> 1:09:37.560]  many Republicans here that have allowed these things to happen to our country.
[1:09:37.560 --> 1:09:39.880]  And this is why primary season is so important.
[1:09:39.880 --> 1:09:44.360]  This is why everyone needs to get involved and we have to make sure that we send the
[1:09:44.360 --> 1:09:49.200]  right people to Congress, people like me, people who are willing to fight because we
[1:09:49.200 --> 1:09:54.480]  have to save our country and sadly, it's in a bad place right now.
[1:09:54.480 --> 1:09:56.560]  They've been doing everything they can to suppress you.
[1:09:56.560 --> 1:10:00.080]  They've really been scared of you without going on the laundry list of censorship and
[1:10:00.080 --> 1:10:02.480]  things that have happened.
[1:10:02.480 --> 1:10:06.280]  What are some of the big issues you want to get across to this audience so they can help
[1:10:06.280 --> 1:10:10.400]  amplify it and what is it about you that scares them so much that you're a private business
[1:10:10.400 --> 1:10:14.600]  woman that you've been successful, that you're loyal to the country?
[1:10:14.600 --> 1:10:20.160]  Yes, absolutely, but I don't back down and I refuse to stop doing and saying the things
[1:10:20.160 --> 1:10:21.160]  that I'm doing.
[1:10:21.160 --> 1:10:25.920]  You know, I just got kicked off a Twitter and I wear that with like a badge of honor
[1:10:25.920 --> 1:10:31.760]  joining you and so many others that have been kicked off that hateful evil leftist platform
[1:10:31.760 --> 1:10:37.520]  that just spread lies and basically controls politics and messaging in the media.
[1:10:37.520 --> 1:10:39.720]  And I'm so happy I got kicked off.
[1:10:39.720 --> 1:10:45.480]  You know, anyone that gets persecuted by these type of platforms, you really are the greatest
[1:10:45.480 --> 1:10:46.480]  Americans.
[1:10:46.480 --> 1:10:50.560]  It's when the evil left comes against you in such a way that they can't even stand
[1:10:50.560 --> 1:10:52.840]  your voice and they kick you off their platforms.
[1:10:52.840 --> 1:10:57.360]  Well, that's a message that you're saying everything right and these are the things
[1:10:57.360 --> 1:11:02.040]  that we have to figure out how to stop, but Republicans have failed us, Alex.
[1:11:02.040 --> 1:11:06.000]  They promised to reign in big tech and do something about it, but they didn't do it
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:07.920]  when they had the opportunity.
[1:11:07.920 --> 1:11:10.840]  And that's why we have to hold Congress accountable.
[1:11:10.840 --> 1:11:11.840]  That's what I care about.
[1:11:11.840 --> 1:11:17.520]  I care about the American people knowing everything that happens here in the swamp and what happens
[1:11:17.520 --> 1:11:20.440]  in these hallways and behind closed doors.
[1:11:20.440 --> 1:11:25.720]  Because I think if the American people could truly see the things that I see and hear every
[1:11:25.720 --> 1:11:29.520]  single day, the American people would never allow it.
[1:11:29.520 --> 1:11:35.080]  And it's this institution that is responsible for all of the failures that have us at $30
[1:11:35.080 --> 1:11:41.880]  million in debt, has a media press that hides behind free press that really is nothing but
[1:11:41.880 --> 1:11:44.320]  propaganda news for the deep state.
[1:11:44.320 --> 1:11:48.920]  This is why our border is wide open and we have illegals, drugs, terrorists, the worst
[1:11:48.920 --> 1:11:50.800]  people coming across our border.
[1:11:50.800 --> 1:11:55.200]  And then Joe Biden and his administration paying for their flights all over the country
[1:11:55.200 --> 1:12:00.080]  coming to anyone's small town and where they live even though it's not a border state.
[1:12:00.080 --> 1:12:05.160]  But the worst things that are happening to me, Alex, is the purge in our military and
[1:12:05.160 --> 1:12:12.440]  the purge in all the agencies and law enforcement and all of these different strong institutions
[1:12:12.440 --> 1:12:17.680]  where it was really the strong people, the alpha males that protected our country, protected
[1:12:17.680 --> 1:12:20.960]  our cities and protected our homes.
[1:12:20.960 --> 1:12:24.520]  But now we're being purged because these are the people that are so strong and courageous
[1:12:24.520 --> 1:12:28.760]  and refusing to take a vaccine that they don't want.
[1:12:28.760 --> 1:12:34.440]  When I stand with them and support everyone that's standing against the vaccine, I'm unvaccinated
[1:12:34.440 --> 1:12:39.080]  and I think that we have every single right to say, hell no, we are not taking that vaccine
[1:12:39.080 --> 1:12:41.000]  and putting it in our body.
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:45.400]  And it's these mandates that are crippling our country and now they're forcing on children
[1:12:45.400 --> 1:12:49.680]  even as young as five months old and it's absolutely disgusting and evil.
[1:12:49.680 --> 1:12:51.360]  Well, it certainly is.
[1:12:51.360 --> 1:12:56.320]  Senator Paul has called it child abuse to give children this injection.
[1:12:56.320 --> 1:12:59.520]  Even if you believe it works, which they're now admitting it doesn't, there's no reason
[1:12:59.520 --> 1:13:00.520]  to give it to a child.
[1:13:00.520 --> 1:13:01.520]  This is pure evil.
[1:13:01.520 --> 1:13:08.360]  No, it's pure evil and what's even worse is how the FDA has said that people can't, doctors
[1:13:08.360 --> 1:13:10.440]  can't prescribe ivermectin.
[1:13:10.440 --> 1:13:15.200]  And now they're saying monoclonal antibodies can't be used against COVID-19 because they're
[1:13:15.200 --> 1:13:21.360]  saying it doesn't work against Omicron and they're forcing masks on children and on people
[1:13:21.360 --> 1:13:22.360]  across the world.
[1:13:22.360 --> 1:13:28.040]  I mean, this is truly mental illness, wearing a mask today after two years of this Chinese
[1:13:28.040 --> 1:13:34.680]  virus that has infected our country, this man-made Chinese virus that Dr. Fauci sent
[1:13:34.680 --> 1:13:39.120]  our tax dollars to and contributed to, but people still wearing masks.
[1:13:39.120 --> 1:13:40.680]  I mean, it's truly mentally ill.
[1:13:40.680 --> 1:13:44.480]  We know the masks don't work and the vaccines don't work.
[1:13:44.480 --> 1:13:48.640]  People that are vaccinated are still getting COVID, but I think that people really have
[1:13:48.640 --> 1:13:54.880]  blood on their hands that have stopped the prescriptions of ivermectin, refused people
[1:13:54.880 --> 1:13:59.880]  who have had sick family members in the hospital of not being able to take ivermectin or any
[1:13:59.880 --> 1:14:02.760]  other kind of life-saving treatment or therapy.
[1:14:02.760 --> 1:14:06.960]  I mean, I truly think that we need to investigate all these people and investigate the deaths
[1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:12.160]  that are reported on the VAERS system and hold people accountable because it's Dr. Fauci
[1:14:12.160 --> 1:14:17.880]  and anyone at the CDC or anyone involved that stopped life-saving treatments and therapies
[1:14:17.880 --> 1:14:18.880]  and people died.
[1:14:18.880 --> 1:14:22.040]  Well, I think they're guilty of murder.
[1:14:22.040 --> 1:14:23.040]  You're absolutely right.
[1:14:23.040 --> 1:14:26.520]  We've got to go to break in a few minutes, but on the subject of this biomedical tyranny
[1:14:26.520 --> 1:14:29.440]  and Fauci, it's come out they cooked it up at the lab.
[1:14:29.440 --> 1:14:30.920]  It's come out they lied to Congress.
[1:14:30.920 --> 1:14:35.400]  It's come out that they then control the whole story and the rollout of it from the beginning
[1:14:35.400 --> 1:14:36.400]  until now.
[1:14:36.400 --> 1:14:40.480]  I mean, I just want to see people brought to justice, and that's why it's so important
[1:14:40.480 --> 1:14:43.320]  that you and others like you are in Congress.
[1:14:43.320 --> 1:14:48.200]  What is Congress trying to do right now to bring that little monster to justice?
[1:14:48.200 --> 1:14:51.320]  Well, unfortunately, this Congress is doing nothing.
[1:14:51.320 --> 1:14:55.560]  You see, I'm a member of the 117th Congress, sadly.
[1:14:55.560 --> 1:14:57.160]  This is the Congress on day one.
[1:14:57.160 --> 1:14:59.560]  Nancy Pelosi passed in her rules.
[1:14:59.560 --> 1:15:02.160]  She totally erased gender and family names.
[1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:06.920]  You can't even say mother, father, grandmother, grandfather, brother, sister, son, daughter.
[1:15:06.920 --> 1:15:12.880]  He, she, all of these proper names that so importantly tell us what God did when he
[1:15:12.880 --> 1:15:18.160]  created us male and female, Nancy Pelosi destroyed that on day one.
[1:15:18.160 --> 1:15:23.920]  And I'm also part of the 117th Congress that was so disgusting and evil that they were
[1:15:23.920 --> 1:15:29.480]  actually able to pass a bill here in this Congress that I'm a part of that would murder
[1:15:29.480 --> 1:15:32.000]  babies up until the day of birth.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:36.880]  So to think that this Congress is doing anything about Dr. Fauci, or rather, we should call
[1:15:36.880 --> 1:15:42.160]  him Dr. Frankenstein, to think that this Congress would do anything about him and do anything
[1:15:42.160 --> 1:15:47.480]  right for the American people to help them get treatments against COVID-19 and stop these
[1:15:47.480 --> 1:15:54.160]  insane tyrannical vaccine mandates and ridiculous masks that's basically child abuse.
[1:15:54.160 --> 1:15:55.400]  Congressman Green, please stay there.
[1:15:55.400 --> 1:15:56.400]  We'll be right back.
[1:15:56.400 --> 1:15:57.400]  Stay with us.

[1:16:58.080 --> 1:17:03.000]  With all the craziness going on in the world, but the globalists plotting their next big
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:08.240]  lockdown, with the next phase of the great reset being a stage cyber attack, with the
[1:17:08.240 --> 1:17:14.840]  deep state pushing a civil war, not just here, but in Europe and war with Russia, with the
[1:17:14.840 --> 1:17:19.760]  massive inflation and all the other garbage that's taking place like supply chain rate
[1:17:19.760 --> 1:17:26.880]  nouns, you need to get prepared now with high quality, storable food that is ready to ship.
[1:17:26.880 --> 1:17:31.880]  And it's been four years since my patriot supply at preparewithalix.com has offered
[1:17:31.880 --> 1:17:36.920]  their storable food at 25% off, four years.
[1:17:36.920 --> 1:17:43.280]  But right now, it's 25% off until February 13, 2022, a little over two weeks from the
[1:17:43.280 --> 1:17:50.600]  time I'm cutting this to get 25% off at preparewithalix.com on the entire catalog of my patriot
[1:17:50.600 --> 1:17:51.600]  supply.
[1:17:51.600 --> 1:17:58.480]  Act now, get prepared now, this is absolutely essential for everybody that wants to be self-sufficient.
[1:17:58.480 --> 1:18:03.880]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[1:18:03.880 --> 1:18:05.920]  a healthier life.
[1:18:05.920 --> 1:18:09.760]  Infowars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement
[1:18:09.760 --> 1:18:11.400]  that contains both.
[1:18:11.400 --> 1:18:16.360]  This infowars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase
[1:18:16.360 --> 1:18:17.960]  from the infowars store.
[1:18:17.960 --> 1:18:22.800]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that
[1:18:22.800 --> 1:18:25.480]  contain the rose plant seeds.
[1:18:25.480 --> 1:18:30.320]  All chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[1:18:30.320 --> 1:18:35.040]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[1:18:35.040 --> 1:18:36.040]  shown.
[1:18:36.040 --> 1:18:40.320]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important
[1:18:40.320 --> 1:18:44.880]  role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[1:18:44.880 --> 1:18:50.000]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  like here in America.
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:56.040]  So next time you visit be sure to check it out at infowarsstore.com where we promise our
[1:18:56.040 --> 1:18:57.800]  rose hips don't lie.
[1:18:57.800 --> 1:19:02.600]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[1:19:02.600 --> 1:19:04.640]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[1:19:04.640 --> 1:19:10.360]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks before they went operational.
[1:19:10.360 --> 1:19:11.360]  But we failed.
[1:19:11.360 --> 1:19:12.800]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[1:19:12.800 --> 1:19:18.640]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational
[1:19:18.640 --> 1:19:20.960]  deindustrialization, great reset.
[1:19:20.960 --> 1:19:25.280]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[1:19:25.280 --> 1:19:29.880]  they know about the show because people are ready to wake up and ready to hear the truth.
[1:19:29.880 --> 1:19:33.160]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda, but
[1:19:33.160 --> 1:19:34.880]  we've also got to get personally prepared.
[1:19:34.880 --> 1:19:37.720]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food.
[1:19:37.720 --> 1:19:42.720]  We've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarsstore.com.
[1:19:42.720 --> 1:19:46.760]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready
[1:19:46.760 --> 1:19:48.400]  to ship right now.
[1:19:48.400 --> 1:19:53.320]  Get your orders in before food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits.
[1:19:53.320 --> 1:19:55.600]  Because believe me, serious times are coming.
[1:19:55.600 --> 1:19:59.960]  Get ready at infowarsstore.com.
[1:19:59.960 --> 1:20:07.080]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:07.080 --> 1:20:15.520]  Well, there's all this talk about what a black woman on the Supreme Court or elect women
[1:20:15.520 --> 1:20:16.520]  to office.
[1:20:16.520 --> 1:20:17.520]  I'm all for that.
[1:20:17.520 --> 1:20:21.440]  Our guest, Congresswoman Green, because I don't care if they're a man or a woman, I
[1:20:21.440 --> 1:20:23.840]  care about what's inside their mind and their soul.
[1:20:23.840 --> 1:20:28.360]  We had a great conversation during the break and she wanted to get back in to this compete
[1:20:28.360 --> 1:20:33.880]  bill that she was telling me is the whole leftist agenda, the build back better, the
[1:20:33.880 --> 1:20:35.240]  whole carbon tax agenda.
[1:20:35.240 --> 1:20:37.240]  Tell us about this bill.
[1:20:37.240 --> 1:20:40.880]  Well this is the bill that Nancy Pelosi is pushing to the floor and I'm going to show
[1:20:40.880 --> 1:20:41.880]  you guys.
[1:20:41.880 --> 1:20:44.800]  It's going to be hard for you to see, but this is the bill.
[1:20:44.800 --> 1:20:45.800]  This is odd.
[1:20:45.800 --> 1:20:50.480]  It's approximately 3,000 pages and it's unbelievable.
[1:20:50.480 --> 1:20:55.400]  They gave it to us on Monday as if we're supposed to all be able to read it and then vote on
[1:20:55.400 --> 1:20:58.480]  it likely, possibly today, maybe tomorrow.
[1:20:58.480 --> 1:21:03.080]  But this is how Congress operates and it shouldn't operate this way and it's filled
[1:21:03.080 --> 1:21:05.120]  with complete garbage.
[1:21:05.120 --> 1:21:07.680]  Everything in there totally hurts our country.
[1:21:07.680 --> 1:21:11.520]  It serves all of AOC's climate change, Green New Deal agenda.
[1:21:11.520 --> 1:21:14.320]  It gives $8 billion for climate change.
[1:21:14.320 --> 1:21:16.800]  It gives billions of dollars to the UN.
[1:21:16.800 --> 1:21:22.660]  It gives all of this money a way that does nothing for our country and get this, Alex.
[1:21:22.660 --> 1:21:29.560]  It only mentions the word fentanyl one time, but yet Chinese from the CCP is what's coming
[1:21:29.560 --> 1:21:33.680]  across our border killing our young people every single day at record numbers.
[1:21:33.680 --> 1:21:35.720]  But that's Nancy Pelosi for you.
[1:21:35.720 --> 1:21:37.400]  That's what she does with her bills.
[1:21:37.400 --> 1:21:38.400]  Absolutely.
[1:21:38.400 --> 1:21:40.640]  I'd like to see you as the speaker of the House.
[1:21:40.640 --> 1:21:46.840]  We're really scared about the midterms in 279 days, but I'm concerned about election fraud.
[1:21:46.840 --> 1:21:47.840]  I am too.
[1:21:47.840 --> 1:21:52.080]  I'm very concerned about it and actually most Republican voters are concerned about it and
[1:21:52.080 --> 1:21:57.360]  they've been very upset that Republicans up here on the Hill haven't taken it serious,
[1:21:57.360 --> 1:22:02.320]  but we should take it serious because a stolen presidential election is the most serious thing
[1:22:02.320 --> 1:22:07.640]  that could happen in our country and we've seen the outcome of Joe Biden becoming our
[1:22:07.640 --> 1:22:12.520]  president for the past year and it's been horrific and we've been suffering ever since.
[1:22:12.520 --> 1:22:17.320]  Didn't you win the last congressional election by the record number in the country?
[1:22:17.320 --> 1:22:20.000]  Or am I wrong about that?
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  Oh, I won.
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:26.160]  I won huge, but I have a strong Republican district, so even they can't question my election.
[1:22:26.160 --> 1:22:27.160]  Well, sure.
[1:22:27.160 --> 1:22:31.840]  Well, the reason I raise that is you're what people want, an amazing, powerful, smart,
[1:22:31.840 --> 1:22:34.640]  beautiful woman promoting freedom.
[1:22:34.640 --> 1:22:39.080]  And that is what scares the Democrats and that's why they want to demonize you and have tried
[1:22:39.080 --> 1:22:42.560]  to expel you from Congress for January 6th.
[1:22:42.560 --> 1:22:44.240]  They're trying to say, I'm involved.
[1:22:44.240 --> 1:22:45.240]  The Democrats are as well.
[1:22:45.240 --> 1:22:49.800]  I mean, how crazy is that because I know you wanted to have the 10-day Senate investigation
[1:22:49.800 --> 1:22:51.480]  that's in law and totally legal.
[1:22:51.480 --> 1:22:52.480]  That's what I wanted.
[1:22:52.480 --> 1:22:56.040]  The last thing we wanted was that fiasco, but I'm really concerned about the vast majority
[1:22:56.040 --> 1:22:59.480]  of folks who are not violent and are innocent political prisoners and we really appreciate
[1:22:59.480 --> 1:23:04.840]  the fact that you've gone and tried to shed light on what's happened to them.
[1:23:04.840 --> 1:23:08.640]  Well, thank you for that and you did absolutely nothing wrong.
[1:23:08.640 --> 1:23:09.760]  I saw the videos.
[1:23:09.760 --> 1:23:11.600]  You were telling people not to go.
[1:23:11.600 --> 1:23:15.840]  You were telling people not to do anything and you were doing everything right, but it's
[1:23:15.840 --> 1:23:21.520]  people like Ray Epps who were telling people to go into the Capitol, urging people to go
[1:23:21.520 --> 1:23:26.000]  in the Capitol, take the Capitol and all these horrible things that Ray Epps said.
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:31.640]  I didn't see Ray Epps in the D.C. jail, Alex, when I went in there, when I saw these pre-trial
[1:23:31.640 --> 1:23:38.680]  January 6th defendants being held in solitary confinement roughly 22 to 23 hours a day.
[1:23:38.680 --> 1:23:41.320]  I didn't see Ray Epps in there.
[1:23:41.320 --> 1:23:45.720]  We need to do these investigations when Republicans take back the House if we're able to take
[1:23:45.720 --> 1:23:49.560]  back the House after this election cycle, but we need to go in there and we need to
[1:23:49.560 --> 1:23:55.480]  find out what's going on because Ray Epps is the one question that no one can answer.
[1:23:55.480 --> 1:23:59.920]  The fact that Adam Kinzing or Liz Cheney and the rest of the Disgusting January 6th Clown
[1:23:59.920 --> 1:24:05.600]  Committee is defending this guy just shows you and exposes all of their lies.
[1:24:05.600 --> 1:24:10.480]  They can't dare come after someone like you, Alex, or innocent people that got legal rally
[1:24:10.480 --> 1:24:16.200]  permits or people that worked for Trump's administration, staffers, and so on.
[1:24:16.200 --> 1:24:19.680]  They shouldn't come after any of you if they're going to stand there and let Ray Epps off
[1:24:19.680 --> 1:24:21.880]  the hook because we know what he did.
[1:24:21.880 --> 1:24:24.600]  He is clearly guilty of more than anyone.
[1:24:24.600 --> 1:24:29.480]  Well, I'm glad you raised him because it's now come out that they had close to 1,000
[1:24:29.480 --> 1:24:33.280]  FBI and military commandos surrounding the Capitol that morning.
[1:24:33.280 --> 1:24:39.400]  They had plain clothes everywhere confirming what the Revolver News put out, confirming
[1:24:39.400 --> 1:24:41.240]  what Tucker Carlson put out.
[1:24:41.240 --> 1:24:44.760]  And so there I am with a few others trying to warn the peaceful crowd when they'd open
[1:24:44.760 --> 1:24:46.480]  the doors to not go in.
[1:24:46.480 --> 1:24:49.200]  Most of them couldn't hear me, but thank God a lot of them did.
[1:24:49.200 --> 1:24:50.200]  It didn't go in.
[1:24:50.200 --> 1:24:54.640]  And there were the feds over 1,000 of them watching while the first group of a few hundred
[1:24:54.640 --> 1:24:59.040]  broke through the police, a lot of those being anti-propagateurs, so I think the investigation
[1:24:59.040 --> 1:25:04.720]  should be there, but this committee doesn't really have any real Republicans on it, does
[1:25:04.720 --> 1:25:05.720]  it?
[1:25:05.720 --> 1:25:06.720]  No, it doesn't.
[1:25:06.720 --> 1:25:10.440]  They have Republicans that left our party and now we're actually doing the bidding of
[1:25:10.440 --> 1:25:11.840]  Nancy Pelosi.
[1:25:11.840 --> 1:25:15.840]  The January 6th committee is the same playbook we saw with Russian collusion.
[1:25:15.840 --> 1:25:20.680]  There's create a bunch of lies, tell a bunch of stories, and get their mainstream media
[1:25:20.680 --> 1:25:26.120]  propagandist to tell their lies for them and put it in the headlines consistently, rinse
[1:25:26.120 --> 1:25:31.080]  and repeat, dirty up Republicans, dirty up President Trump, dirty up anyone that supports
[1:25:31.080 --> 1:25:37.040]  them so that they can hopefully affect elections going forward and keep selling the propaganda
[1:25:37.040 --> 1:25:40.360]  so they keep people believing things that just aren't true.
[1:25:40.360 --> 1:25:43.920]  And the playbook is old and people are really sick and tired of it.
[1:25:43.920 --> 1:25:49.040]  Speaking of Russia gate, we now know that was a fraud, Democrats have been indicted
[1:25:49.040 --> 1:25:53.680]  for lying and setting it up, but they've now moved on again to use Russia as another
[1:25:53.680 --> 1:25:54.680]  distraction.
[1:25:54.680 --> 1:25:58.080]  What's your view being in the Congress, seeing the intelligence about what's really happening
[1:25:58.080 --> 1:25:59.080]  in the Ukraine?
[1:25:59.080 --> 1:26:04.160]  Well, you know, I'm really angry about that and I wrote a piece that should be out later
[1:26:04.160 --> 1:26:09.680]  today and I wrote, it's called Screw Carl Rove, and you know, it's people like Carl
[1:26:09.680 --> 1:26:15.000]  Rove and this political consulting class that has supported the Bushes and supported all
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:19.960]  of these Republicans that are the neocons that beat their chest and want war.
[1:26:19.960 --> 1:26:25.480]  And so people like Carl Rove and all of these other rhinos want to send 18-year-olds like
[1:26:25.480 --> 1:26:30.920]  my son to go fight a war against nuclear Russia so that they can defend Ukraine when they
[1:26:30.920 --> 1:26:35.040]  aren't doing anything about our own southern border, and if our military goes anywhere
[1:26:35.040 --> 1:26:40.440]  it should be at our southern border, defending our own country, not someone else's country.
[1:26:40.440 --> 1:26:44.200]  And so, you know, when it comes to this whole issue with Russia and Ukraine, I think it
[1:26:44.200 --> 1:26:47.160]  is just, it is infuriating.
[1:26:47.160 --> 1:26:51.400]  And when they're attacking Tucker Carlson and anyone else that's standing up and actually
[1:26:51.400 --> 1:26:56.360]  speaking the truth on how most Americans feel, well, you know, that just shows exactly
[1:26:56.360 --> 1:26:58.560]  who they are and it's typical of them.
[1:26:58.560 --> 1:27:02.600]  They make a lot of money off of these wars, they love the contracts, it serves the State
[1:27:02.600 --> 1:27:07.200]  Department, the piton, and it basically just all the neocons, this is what they love to
[1:27:07.200 --> 1:27:12.840]  do so that all of their donors can get rich off of people dying in some foreign country.
[1:27:12.840 --> 1:27:17.520]  Well, the good news is they've got Rasmussen and Gallup polls that show 15-20% of Americans
[1:27:17.520 --> 1:27:20.520]  support any type of troops to Ukraine.
[1:27:20.520 --> 1:27:25.640]  America is speaking up and Republicans more and more becoming the party thanks to Trump
[1:27:25.640 --> 1:27:29.560]  and you and others of not wanting war and being a peace party, and that's what people
[1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:35.000]  want and that's why liberals should abandon their party and come to the new Republican
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:38.440]  populist America first party.
[1:27:38.440 --> 1:27:39.440]  That's right.
[1:27:39.440 --> 1:27:42.280]  Well, you know, I think Americans really are there.
[1:27:42.280 --> 1:27:48.080]  It's the people here in this town, people on the hill and a bunch of egotistical, arrogant
[1:27:48.080 --> 1:27:53.960]  politicians and the consultants that work for them running these polls that really don't
[1:27:53.960 --> 1:27:55.880]  ask the right questions a lot of times.
[1:27:55.880 --> 1:27:59.920]  They just haven't caught up with the people or maybe they were never with the people because
[1:27:59.920 --> 1:28:02.320]  look at what has happened over these decades.
[1:28:02.320 --> 1:28:07.680]  This is the party that produced Bush that failed, led us to Barack Obama and now here
[1:28:07.680 --> 1:28:12.760]  we are at $30 trillion in debt and it's just like it's so bad.
[1:28:12.760 --> 1:28:13.760]  It's so disgusting.
[1:28:13.760 --> 1:28:15.800]  You can hardly wrap your head around it.
[1:28:15.800 --> 1:28:18.320]  But this is where the American people have always been.
[1:28:18.320 --> 1:28:20.360]  We've always been populist.
[1:28:20.360 --> 1:28:22.200]  We've always been nationalist.
[1:28:22.200 --> 1:28:24.280]  We always have been America first.
[1:28:24.280 --> 1:28:29.600]  We've always wanted our tax dollars to go towards things that help us and protect our
[1:28:29.600 --> 1:28:36.760]  small businesses and help our people be independent and protect our freedoms so that we can succeed
[1:28:36.760 --> 1:28:42.720]  as Americans so that our children can have the same future that God has given us here
[1:28:42.720 --> 1:28:43.720]  in our country.
[1:28:43.720 --> 1:28:44.720]  But these are the people.
[1:28:44.720 --> 1:28:45.720]  MTG.
[1:28:45.720 --> 1:28:46.720]  MTG.

[1:28:53.880 --> 1:28:54.880]  back.
[1:28:54.880 --> 1:28:55.880]  MTG for America.

[1:28:57.880 --> 1:28:59.760]  Sold out for months.
[1:28:59.760 --> 1:29:02.400]  X3 is now back in stock.

[1:29:06.240 --> 1:29:09.400]  and so many people are deficient in iodine.

[1:30:58.720 --> 1:31:01.560]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming.
[1:31:01.560 --> 1:31:06.760]  They're here all over the world, from Australia to the United States, from Canada to Germany.
[1:31:06.760 --> 1:31:10.680]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go, then coming to your house
[1:31:10.680 --> 1:31:17.160]  and threatening, in some cases, actually taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[1:31:17.160 --> 1:31:21.520]  They're planning in the next year to expand their shield process, where they come and
[1:31:21.520 --> 1:31:25.680]  take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[1:31:25.680 --> 1:31:27.680]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[1:31:27.680 --> 1:31:31.840]  One big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many of
[1:31:31.840 --> 1:31:36.000]  which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military
[1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:38.600]  grade at infowarstore.com.

[1:32:00.000 --> 1:32:06.920]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class, not
[1:32:06.920 --> 1:32:11.800]  in communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere.
[1:32:11.800 --> 1:32:16.160]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class?
[1:32:16.160 --> 1:32:17.880]  That's done by design.
[1:32:17.880 --> 1:32:23.920]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[1:32:23.920 --> 1:32:28.800]  that look in to say the Anglo-American establishment, the founder of the Bilderberg group, the Trilateral
[1:32:28.800 --> 1:32:33.920]  Commission of the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[1:32:33.920 --> 1:32:38.640]  Until 10 years ago, the media said the controlled corporate media, the Bilderberg group, didn't
[1:32:38.640 --> 1:32:39.640]  exist.
[1:32:39.640 --> 1:32:43.920]  Well, now the Bilderberg group is public, its former head, still on the steering committee,
[1:32:43.920 --> 1:32:48.640]  is Klaus Schwab, and he has set up the great reset in global government.
[1:32:48.640 --> 1:32:53.480]  And if, as a liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head-on about
[1:32:53.480 --> 1:32:57.400]  the fact that they are a worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a shot.
[1:32:57.400 --> 1:32:59.640]  We do expose them, we can beat them easily.
[1:32:59.640 --> 1:33:09.840]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:09.840 --> 1:33:27.200]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:27.200 --> 1:33:41.000]  Can we get you to run for president in the next few years, because I think you're one
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:45.200]  of the few people that would probably have a better voting record and have a better chance
[1:33:45.200 --> 1:33:50.920]  of winning than even Trump, or maybe a Green DeSantis ticket?
[1:33:50.920 --> 1:33:55.240]  Well, Alex, I don't know what's going to happen.
[1:33:55.240 --> 1:34:00.200]  I'm a very strong supporter of President Trump, but in the future, we'll definitely
[1:34:00.200 --> 1:34:01.200]  see what happens.
[1:34:01.200 --> 1:34:03.760]  I'll see what the people think about something like that.
[1:34:03.760 --> 1:34:10.400]  But we need a green agenda, build back better with President Green.
[1:34:10.400 --> 1:34:16.760]  Well, my agenda would be all for this country, I just, I love our country and I hate, absolutely
[1:34:16.760 --> 1:34:20.120]  hate what the federal government has done to the American people.
[1:34:20.120 --> 1:34:21.120]  Sure, absolutely.
[1:34:21.120 --> 1:34:24.680]  Before CNN spends that, I'm not actually endorsing their fake green agenda, their
[1:34:24.680 --> 1:34:25.680]  Congress agenda.
[1:34:25.680 --> 1:34:26.880]  It's a play on words.
[1:34:26.880 --> 1:34:30.840]  We need to go green with President Green, Congresswoman Green.
[1:34:30.840 --> 1:34:35.520]  And so you already won the last election in a landslide, and I guess you're set to win
[1:34:35.520 --> 1:34:36.520]  it again?
[1:34:36.520 --> 1:34:40.760]  Yes, I'm so grateful to all the wonderful people in my district.
[1:34:40.760 --> 1:34:46.160]  I have such strong support with them, and it's just because I keep doing and saying what
[1:34:46.160 --> 1:34:49.680]  I promised them I would do, and I'll never stop doing that.
[1:34:49.680 --> 1:34:52.080]  So I'm grateful to Georgia's 14th district.
[1:34:52.080 --> 1:34:55.640]  We got cut off on an earlier break when we were getting into a little monster that clown
[1:34:55.640 --> 1:35:00.360]  is Fauci, who wants to censor everybody and wants to force injections on children and
[1:35:00.360 --> 1:35:02.160]  mass that don't work and the rest of it.
[1:35:02.160 --> 1:35:05.240]  Everything he says around to be a fraud, including lying to Congress, obviously, about
[1:35:05.240 --> 1:35:06.560]  getting a function.
[1:35:06.560 --> 1:35:12.160]  But what do you make of Laura Logan getting deplatformed and getting attacked for coming
[1:35:12.160 --> 1:35:13.920]  out and comparing him to Joseph Mingle?
[1:35:13.920 --> 1:35:17.480]  I think it's a very fair comparison.
[1:35:17.480 --> 1:35:23.560]  I think it's a fair comparison that it's basically been one big human experiment, right?
[1:35:23.560 --> 1:35:26.120]  That's what COVID-19 vaccines have been.
[1:35:26.120 --> 1:35:30.760]  That's what COVID-19 has been, especially since we know it was engineered in a lab,
[1:35:30.760 --> 1:35:33.720]  and then when it went all over the world.
[1:35:33.720 --> 1:35:35.320]  And that's what a human experiment is.
[1:35:35.320 --> 1:35:40.040]  There should have never been a COVID-19, but the gain of function research that Fauci
[1:35:40.040 --> 1:35:44.600]  funded through a grant through a third party is what made it possible.
[1:35:44.600 --> 1:35:47.120]  So that is an experiment.
[1:35:47.120 --> 1:35:53.440]  And then these vaccines, which were in emergency use only, that's how they were labeled emergency
[1:35:53.440 --> 1:35:58.760]  use that allowed the FDA to speed this up and these vaccines to go forward.
[1:35:58.760 --> 1:36:03.440]  They very much have been an experiment, but the right questions haven't been asked.
[1:36:03.440 --> 1:36:06.880]  Why are there so many deaths reported on the VAERS system?
[1:36:06.880 --> 1:36:10.760]  Why are there so many vaccine injuries reported on the VAERS system?
[1:36:10.760 --> 1:36:16.520]  Why are so many people having blood clot issues, heart issues after they've been having these
[1:36:16.520 --> 1:36:17.520]  vaccines?
[1:36:17.520 --> 1:36:23.320]  Healthy soccer players in foreign countries dropping dead after they've been vaccinated.
[1:36:23.320 --> 1:36:27.600]  These are the questions that need to be asked about this giant human experiment that the
[1:36:27.600 --> 1:36:29.640]  world has been going through.
[1:36:29.640 --> 1:36:31.560]  And why is the Pfizer vaccine?
[1:36:31.560 --> 1:36:37.840]  Why is Big Pharma vaccines the only answer instead of real treatments like ivermectin,
[1:36:37.840 --> 1:36:42.680]  which we know works, monoclonal antibodies, which we know works, hydroxychloroquine, all
[1:36:42.680 --> 1:36:47.120]  of these other wonderful things that brave doctors have been treating their patients
[1:36:47.120 --> 1:36:48.120]  with.
[1:36:48.120 --> 1:36:49.280]  Why aren't those things allowed?
[1:36:49.280 --> 1:36:50.960]  And who does that serve really?
[1:36:50.960 --> 1:36:55.400]  So do I think Lara Logan should have been de-platformed or attacked for what she said?
[1:36:55.400 --> 1:36:56.400]  No, absolutely not.
[1:36:56.400 --> 1:37:01.200]  As a matter of fact, I tend to agree with Lara Logan and I think most people do as well.
[1:37:01.200 --> 1:37:03.360]  I think maybe she should run for office.
[1:37:03.360 --> 1:37:04.360]  That's what we need.
[1:37:04.360 --> 1:37:07.400]  You guys to, you know, get in there and clean up the house.
[1:37:07.400 --> 1:37:12.440]  There are so many things happening, but the entire agenda is based on censorship.
[1:37:12.440 --> 1:37:15.200]  And thank God that you're a passionate, hardworking Congresswoman.
[1:37:15.200 --> 1:37:17.840]  You've got a lot of connections, a lot of energy, so you're able to get around the
[1:37:17.840 --> 1:37:18.840]  censors.
[1:37:18.840 --> 1:37:21.360]  But for so many other people, they've been destroyed by this.
[1:37:21.360 --> 1:37:25.760]  And even the former president, the real president, he's been blocked.
[1:37:25.760 --> 1:37:30.600]  And one of his big failings was not getting Congress to take action when he did have the
[1:37:30.600 --> 1:37:34.440]  House and Senate his first two years.
[1:37:34.440 --> 1:37:38.920]  If Republicans win the House and Senate back, what are you going to push for and what do
[1:37:38.920 --> 1:37:45.680]  you think Trump should push for to finally stand up to big tech in their reign of terror?
[1:37:45.680 --> 1:37:47.880]  I think we have to break apart their power.
[1:37:47.880 --> 1:37:49.920]  We have to break apart their monopolies.
[1:37:49.920 --> 1:37:54.000]  You see, it's their monopolies that stop the little guys from being able to compete
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  with them.
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:57.440]  And that's the whole problem with globalism, right?
[1:37:57.440 --> 1:38:03.800]  It's this nasty combination of powerful corporations with government power and policies that creates
[1:38:03.800 --> 1:38:06.320]  something that I call corporate communism.
[1:38:06.320 --> 1:38:10.080]  That's where the communists and the government are able to push their policies through these
[1:38:10.080 --> 1:38:14.880]  corporations that has caused so many people to be censored when they were just using their
[1:38:14.880 --> 1:38:20.080]  free speech, saying their opinions, and that it was the powers that be the fact checkers
[1:38:20.080 --> 1:38:27.800]  and all of these bureaucrats and hard leftist communists and these big tech companies that
[1:38:27.800 --> 1:38:33.520]  kick people off and say, no, your voice, your opinion, your views are not allowed.
[1:38:33.520 --> 1:38:36.440]  And therefore, we fact checked you and you're wrong.
[1:38:36.440 --> 1:38:38.480]  And so these are all the things we have to stop.
[1:38:38.480 --> 1:38:43.080]  But I think breaking apart the monopolies is a huge first step.
[1:38:43.080 --> 1:38:49.080]  We have to look at how we view these companies, looking at them in a different lens and then
[1:38:49.080 --> 1:38:53.960]  being brave enough to pass legislation and signing it into law, getting the job done,
[1:38:53.960 --> 1:38:57.720]  not promising our voters one thing about big tech and never delivering.
[1:38:57.720 --> 1:39:01.240]  It's time to actually do something about it when we take power back.
[1:39:01.240 --> 1:39:06.120]  This woman, Green, in the few minutes we have left, I'm glad that you raise globalism.
[1:39:06.120 --> 1:39:07.800]  That was my last question.
[1:39:07.800 --> 1:39:09.520]  You understand Bill Backbatter.
[1:39:09.520 --> 1:39:11.040]  You understand the great reset.
[1:39:11.040 --> 1:39:14.280]  You've read, because I see your speeches and interviews, about Klaus Schwab.
[1:39:14.280 --> 1:39:16.480]  You're one of the few members of Congress that gets this.
[1:39:16.480 --> 1:39:21.040]  If we don't understand, it's a corporate authoritarian model that wants monopolies that
[1:39:21.040 --> 1:39:24.920]  uses communist ideology to domesticate and control populations.
[1:39:24.920 --> 1:39:28.920]  And what they want are these monopolies and authoritarian control and that censorship
[1:39:28.920 --> 1:39:33.640]  and surveillance and all of this is incredibly dangerous and is now taken as to where we
[1:39:33.640 --> 1:39:37.240]  knew it would go when they're now trying to arrest their political opposition.
[1:39:37.240 --> 1:39:42.000]  So if we want to win this, we've got to understand we're not fighting Russia.
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:44.520]  China's got its own problems, but it's not even the main enemy of my view.
[1:39:44.520 --> 1:39:45.520]  It is.
[1:39:45.520 --> 1:39:49.880]  These middlemen Trump talked about, these corporate globalists that literally are shutting down
[1:39:49.880 --> 1:39:54.880]  their competition, using lockdowns to destroy mom and pop stores and bragging and doubling
[1:39:54.880 --> 1:39:57.280]  their wealth during the last two years of this tyranny.
[1:39:57.280 --> 1:40:03.440]  I mean, this is a authoritarian corporate administered consolidation of control.
[1:40:03.440 --> 1:40:06.360]  And can you speak to the great reset in your views on this?
[1:40:06.360 --> 1:40:10.760]  And you agree with me that it's paramount to expose the real enemy, like in World War
[1:40:10.760 --> 1:40:11.760]  II, the enemy was Hitler.
[1:40:11.760 --> 1:40:17.280]  Well, this time it's Klaus Schwab and the Bilderberg group and the public arm, the
[1:40:17.280 --> 1:40:18.280]  Davos group.
[1:40:18.280 --> 1:40:21.720]  Oh, I absolutely think they're the enemy.
[1:40:21.720 --> 1:40:26.360]  You know what, you know what makes the full of you and me is when we don't take people
[1:40:26.360 --> 1:40:31.400]  at their word and we're taking them at their word and so we're not fools, Alex.
[1:40:31.400 --> 1:40:32.400]  We know what they say.
[1:40:32.400 --> 1:40:37.040]  We know what they want to do because they say it out loud, but what is foolish is not
[1:40:37.040 --> 1:40:40.120]  believing them and not taking them at their word.
[1:40:40.120 --> 1:40:42.240]  They are very serious about the great reset.
[1:40:42.240 --> 1:40:44.760]  They're very serious about globalism.
[1:40:44.760 --> 1:40:49.840]  And this is something that America was never meant to be a part of.
[1:40:49.840 --> 1:40:53.160]  And it's the people that align themselves with this group right here.
[1:40:53.160 --> 1:40:58.360]  You know, I've had a few of my colleagues actually go to Davos and I think that's wrong.
[1:40:58.360 --> 1:41:02.400]  I don't think that anyone in the Republican conference should be a part of that or take
[1:41:02.400 --> 1:41:05.600]  money from these types of people.
[1:41:05.600 --> 1:41:07.120]  That's where you get misled.
[1:41:07.120 --> 1:41:13.880]  And a lot of politicians take money from big corporate executives and big corporate donors
[1:41:13.880 --> 1:41:19.680]  who are aligning themselves with this project, aligning themselves with this group right
[1:41:19.680 --> 1:41:24.280]  here that is leading us down the wrong way because they're forgetting that they worked
[1:41:24.280 --> 1:41:27.160]  for the people that voted them into office.
[1:41:27.160 --> 1:41:32.960]  And those are the regular Americans, just great people that do not want our country
[1:41:32.960 --> 1:41:35.480]  involved in any kind of global economy.
[1:41:35.480 --> 1:41:43.040]  We don't want the future to be about destroying the dollar and having some global currency
[1:41:43.040 --> 1:41:45.040]  that everyone has to serve.
[1:41:45.040 --> 1:41:50.320]  We don't want to move into those type of things, but very sadly and tragically, that
[1:41:50.320 --> 1:41:53.840]  is the hard and fast direction our country is going in.
[1:41:53.840 --> 1:41:56.200]  And that's why it's so important to stop it.
[1:41:56.200 --> 1:41:57.200]  Well, that's right.
[1:41:57.200 --> 1:42:01.080]  Via the vaccine passport, we have the social credit score and the global carbon tax system
[1:42:01.080 --> 1:42:03.880]  officially being rolled out in Europe, Australia.
[1:42:03.880 --> 1:42:06.960]  And now it's popping up with people's phones here on the apps.
[1:42:06.960 --> 1:42:07.960]  Very, very dangerous.
[1:42:07.960 --> 1:42:11.800]  And of course, people like Tulsi Gabbard, she went to Davos, but she's now rejected
[1:42:11.800 --> 1:42:12.800]  it.
[1:42:12.800 --> 1:42:16.520]  And the credit shot need to reject it and not come out and claim that you don't have
[1:42:16.520 --> 1:42:18.480]  a good voting record that he does.
[1:42:18.480 --> 1:42:19.680]  When the truth is, it's the other way around.
[1:42:19.680 --> 1:42:20.680]  I'm not attacking him.
[1:42:20.680 --> 1:42:25.960]  I want credit shot to join us, but we've got to really hold his feet to the fire.
[1:42:25.960 --> 1:42:27.040]  Congresswoman, you're amazing.
[1:42:27.040 --> 1:42:29.680]  We'll put your website back on screen for people to find you.
[1:42:29.680 --> 1:42:33.360]  It's M-T-G-4, America on Getter.
[1:42:33.360 --> 1:42:37.160]  And again, I look forward to speaking to you again very, very soon, and God bless you.
[1:42:37.160 --> 1:42:38.160]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[1:42:38.160 --> 1:42:39.160]  We'll talk again.
[1:42:39.160 --> 1:42:40.160]  Wow.
[1:42:40.160 --> 1:42:41.160]  That was great.
[1:42:41.160 --> 1:42:42.160]  Well, there she goes, folks.
[1:42:42.160 --> 1:42:43.160]  That was amazing.
[1:42:43.160 --> 1:42:48.240]  We need 400-something like her in Congress right now.
[1:42:48.240 --> 1:42:49.240]  Wow.
[1:42:49.240 --> 1:42:53.160]  I tell you, that lady is even more amazing on that HD Skype.
[1:42:53.160 --> 1:42:54.160]  She just makes me excited.
[1:42:54.160 --> 1:42:55.160]  We'll be right back.
[1:42:55.160 --> 1:42:56.160]  Stay with us.
[1:42:56.160 --> 1:43:03.240]  With all the craziness going on in the world, but the globalist plotted their next big lock
[1:43:03.240 --> 1:43:09.120]  down for the next phase of the Great Reset being a stage cyber attack with the deep state
[1:43:09.120 --> 1:43:15.360]  pushing a civil war, not just here, but in Europe and war with Russia with the massive
[1:43:15.360 --> 1:43:20.560]  inflation and all the other garbage that's taking place like supply chain right now.
[1:43:20.560 --> 1:43:26.840]  You need to get prepared now with high quality, storable food that is ready to ship.
[1:43:26.840 --> 1:43:31.840]  And it's been four years since my Patriot supply at PrepareWithAlex.com has offered

[1:43:43.240 --> 1:43:50.560]  time I'm cutting this to get 25% off at PrepareWithAlex.com on the entire catalog of my Patriot
[1:43:50.560 --> 1:43:51.560]  supply.

[1:45:02.600 --> 1:45:07.960]  between three individuals and nation-states on one side and the globalist on the other
[1:45:07.960 --> 1:45:11.160]  who are literally trying to create a post-human world.
[1:45:11.160 --> 1:45:16.080]  From the United States to Brazil, and of course triggered by the Brexit in the UK, nations
[1:45:16.080 --> 1:45:19.760]  were pulling out of the private, corporate, fascist world government.
[1:45:19.760 --> 1:45:25.160]  That's why they launched their Great Reset and their program after collapsing us of Build
[1:45:25.160 --> 1:45:26.960]  Back Better.
[1:45:26.960 --> 1:45:32.920]  This is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[1:45:32.920 --> 1:45:35.760]  Because they couldn't take our guns and because we wouldn't bow.
[1:45:35.760 --> 1:45:40.720]  Because the left, which is the ideology of this world government system, couldn't win.
[1:45:40.720 --> 1:45:43.720]  They released a biological weapon on us.
[1:45:43.720 --> 1:45:47.640]  Now we know, two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[1:45:47.640 --> 1:45:48.640]  It's that simple.
[1:45:48.640 --> 1:45:52.960]  They can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns, so the global corporate combine
[1:45:52.960 --> 1:45:56.160]  released COVID-19 and you know the rest of history.
[1:45:56.160 --> 1:45:57.160]  Close this paradigm and we win.
[1:45:57.160 --> 1:45:59.680]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[1:45:59.680 --> 1:46:01.720]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[1:46:01.720 --> 1:46:02.720]  Welcome.
[1:46:02.720 --> 1:46:03.720]  Hello, Alex.
[1:46:03.720 --> 1:46:04.720]  Yes, Malcolm.
[1:46:04.720 --> 1:46:05.720]  All right.
[1:46:05.720 --> 1:46:07.720]  I will make this quick and real short where the other patriots can get on the line.
[1:46:07.720 --> 1:46:12.600]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer, SuperMail
[1:46:12.600 --> 1:46:15.360]  Vitality and Brain Force Plus.
[1:46:15.360 --> 1:46:16.360]  Mix those two together.
[1:46:16.360 --> 1:46:17.920]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[1:46:17.920 --> 1:46:19.880]  SuperMail Vitality really, really works.
[1:46:19.880 --> 1:46:24.840]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[1:46:24.840 --> 1:46:30.440]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well
[1:46:30.440 --> 1:46:31.440]  but just aren't as strong.
[1:46:31.440 --> 1:46:33.440]  This is like a very fine wine.
[1:46:33.440 --> 1:46:35.840]  In fact, each batch is different.
[1:46:35.840 --> 1:46:36.840]  Sometimes it's super strong.
[1:46:36.840 --> 1:46:37.840]  Sometimes it's just okay.
[1:46:37.840 --> 1:46:41.120]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as
[1:46:41.120 --> 1:46:42.120]  strong?
[1:46:42.120 --> 1:46:43.120]  That's just how it is.
[1:46:43.120 --> 1:46:44.120]  It's how it works.
[1:46:44.120 --> 1:46:45.120]  So it's always good.
[1:46:45.120 --> 1:46:47.640]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[1:46:47.640 --> 1:46:59.840]  Yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[1:46:59.840 --> 1:47:23.880]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:23.880 --> 1:47:28.000]  What we're witnessing is a coming out of evil.
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:34.880]  The public has been put into a near trance on average.
[1:47:34.880 --> 1:47:42.400]  Brainwaves are at a near sleep level, the many people daydreaming, highly suggestible.
[1:47:42.400 --> 1:47:44.280]  And the globalists are probing.
[1:47:44.280 --> 1:47:46.000]  The globalists are testing.
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:48.400]  I woke up about 3 a.m. this morning, had trouble going back to sleep.
[1:47:48.400 --> 1:47:51.520]  I was just so freaked out about all the news.
[1:47:51.520 --> 1:47:56.480]  And that hard clip I was sent before I got to bed with other professors saying having
[1:47:56.480 --> 1:48:03.280]  sex with one-year-olds isn't bad, you know, because they agree with it, which is so sick.
[1:48:03.280 --> 1:48:04.880]  And it just hit me.
[1:48:04.880 --> 1:48:08.040]  You've got to start the show tomorrow with this fact.
[1:48:08.040 --> 1:48:10.600]  And everybody already knows this innately.
[1:48:10.600 --> 1:48:12.880]  I'm not telling you something you don't know.
[1:48:12.880 --> 1:48:15.560]  I'm reminding you of this and how important this is.
[1:48:15.560 --> 1:48:18.480]  This is all a test.
[1:48:18.480 --> 1:48:22.240]  By the Debo script, by the globalists, by the perverts, by all the different consortiums
[1:48:22.240 --> 1:48:27.320]  of evil to see what we'll put up with and what we'll go along with.
[1:48:27.320 --> 1:48:31.920]  And so as bad as the last two years has been, and all the insanity is taking place, this
[1:48:31.920 --> 1:48:35.320]  is them probing to see what they can get away with.
[1:48:35.320 --> 1:48:43.680]  And they're compromised, controlled, individuals for stuff way beyond, oh, the head of CNN
[1:48:43.680 --> 1:48:48.280]  stepped down because he had an improper relationship with an employee.
[1:48:48.280 --> 1:48:54.120]  No, folks, you don't get in a position like that unless you are a pedophile or unless
[1:48:54.120 --> 1:49:00.480]  you've killed people and they have all the dirt on you.
[1:49:00.480 --> 1:49:02.200]  They don't trust you.
[1:49:02.200 --> 1:49:11.040]  Everybody knows that gangs, whether they are old-fashioned 1950s greasers, you know, gearheads
[1:49:11.040 --> 1:49:17.160]  or whether it is black gangs or Hispanic gangs or white gangs, white supremacist gangs, all
[1:49:17.160 --> 1:49:23.120]  over the world, Japanese, Chinese gangs, African gangs, how do you get in the gang?
[1:49:23.120 --> 1:49:27.600]  Well, before you become a member, you've got to go out and be a support person that commits
[1:49:27.600 --> 1:49:35.680]  crimes to prove you'll do it and that so they have dirt on you so when you commit crimes
[1:49:35.680 --> 1:49:48.480]  with them, that when you commit crimes with them, that when you commit crimes with them,
[1:49:48.480 --> 1:49:53.280]  they have dirt on you to destroy you if they want to.
[1:49:53.280 --> 1:49:59.880]  Except starting in about the 50s in Europe and the U.S. and other areas, they started
[1:49:59.880 --> 1:50:06.920]  letting people plea bargain commonly if they would rat out the superiors in the crime.
[1:50:06.920 --> 1:50:12.200]  But see, nobody's going to let the FBI or the Justice Department or state prosecutors
[1:50:12.200 --> 1:50:18.520]  plea bargain with somebody that's part of a baby raping cult because no one even wants
[1:50:18.520 --> 1:50:21.480]  to go on the news and say, we busted a baby raping cult.
[1:50:21.480 --> 1:50:24.040]  No one's going to believe that.
[1:50:24.040 --> 1:50:30.200]  No one's going to believe that through the leftist arms of Harvard and the CIA, because
[1:50:30.200 --> 1:50:33.240]  there's good people in those agencies, there's good people at Harvard and people in the CIA,
[1:50:33.240 --> 1:50:39.160]  but in the leftist arm of the CIA on record, farming children out through the CPS and family
[1:50:39.160 --> 1:50:44.480]  courts in occupied Germany, starting out for World War II, running till today, hundreds
[1:50:44.480 --> 1:50:52.440]  of thousands of children, 30,000 in one region, one state alone, given to rapists of children
[1:50:52.440 --> 1:50:54.840]  to be raised by them.
[1:50:54.840 --> 1:50:59.280]  That's to create that culture and that pool of people that they know are so horrible and
[1:50:59.280 --> 1:51:01.760]  so evil, no one will be able to believe it.
[1:51:01.760 --> 1:51:05.600]  That's how they took over the Boy Scouts, the Catholic Church, Penn State, Boystown,
[1:51:05.600 --> 1:51:06.600]  all of it.
[1:51:06.600 --> 1:51:08.280]  You're like, why are there so many damn pedophiles?
[1:51:08.280 --> 1:51:10.320]  There's not, folks.
[1:51:10.320 --> 1:51:16.160]  They're not even 1% of the population, but they make people do it to be in the club.
[1:51:16.160 --> 1:51:20.840]  It's come out in FBI documents, I remember Ted Gunnerson telling me this 25 years ago,
[1:51:20.840 --> 1:51:24.080]  even the Finder's documents last year got released by the FBI, thousands of pages,
[1:51:24.080 --> 1:51:25.080]  and I went over it.
[1:51:25.080 --> 1:51:30.280]  And so much of it was exactly what he told me because he knew about the case.
[1:51:30.280 --> 1:51:33.960]  And it would describe these rich, powerful people who were already worth hundreds of
[1:51:33.960 --> 1:51:37.480]  millions that wanted to be higher up in the Globalist Club and how the husband and wife
[1:51:37.480 --> 1:51:40.560]  would be marched into a room with a six-year-old girl tied up.
[1:51:40.560 --> 1:51:42.800]  They'd say, all right, I'd have sex with her.
[1:51:42.800 --> 1:51:48.120]  And the woman would be throwing up and their husband couldn't get, didn't want to do it,
[1:51:48.120 --> 1:51:50.200]  couldn't get an erection.
[1:51:50.200 --> 1:51:54.880]  And then the people walk them out, punch them in the face, and say, listen, we already
[1:51:54.880 --> 1:51:56.800]  got video of you with that kid.
[1:51:56.800 --> 1:52:01.480]  Now, you get a hard on, and you get in there, and you screw her.
[1:52:01.480 --> 1:52:05.800]  Now, I'm sorry to talk like this, folks, but you go read that stuff yourself, a CIA base
[1:52:05.800 --> 1:52:11.200]  in D.C. doing that with people, marching in husbands and wives and saying, get in there
[1:52:11.200 --> 1:52:15.440]  and rape that toddler.
[1:52:15.440 --> 1:52:20.960]  And that's how they talk to him, too.
[1:52:20.960 --> 1:52:24.440]  Now you imagine that, and you think about that, and you think about who these people
[1:52:24.440 --> 1:52:27.440]  are.
[1:52:27.440 --> 1:52:32.920]  And then you understand why we're in so much trouble, because they can't ever have a plea
[1:52:32.920 --> 1:52:33.920]  bargain on that.
[1:52:33.920 --> 1:52:40.400]  That can't come out, can it, except it is coming out.
[1:52:40.400 --> 1:52:44.520]  And that's what Epstein was doing, folks, because a lot of times they tell them, all
[1:52:44.520 --> 1:52:49.680]  right, we got this eight-year-old, yeah, he's been in our hands for five years.
[1:52:49.680 --> 1:52:52.120]  He's been fighting back, bit one of our people.
[1:52:52.120 --> 1:52:54.520]  I want you to go in there and strangle him.
[1:52:54.520 --> 1:53:00.280]  Listen, I got into this for, I mean, I've already, listen, we're going to kill you and
[1:53:00.280 --> 1:53:06.080]  your family if you don't get in there and strangle that little piece of crap.
[1:53:06.080 --> 1:53:10.720]  They get in there, and they strangle the little kid.
[1:53:10.720 --> 1:53:14.440]  They go now, get your crap and get out of here.
[1:53:14.440 --> 1:53:18.320]  That's exactly how they talk to him.
[1:53:18.320 --> 1:53:21.840]  Imagine federal prosecutors, or the FBI, they got a bad guy, they're like, listen here,
[1:53:21.840 --> 1:53:24.480]  buddy, you're going to prison for 100 years, you don't do it, except it's like, you rape
[1:53:24.480 --> 1:53:29.440]  that child, you get in there and do it.
[1:53:29.440 --> 1:53:33.280]  And that's who runs your government, that's who runs your country.
[1:53:33.280 --> 1:53:38.840]  And 99.9% of us aren't involved in this, and we don't know, and it's so horrible that
[1:53:38.840 --> 1:53:43.280]  we don't even know how to deal with it, and I understand.
[1:53:43.280 --> 1:53:51.680]  I understand why people don't want to believe this, I understand why it's so painful, I understand.
[1:53:51.680 --> 1:53:59.400]  But it's real, and it's right there, confirm now.
[1:53:59.400 --> 1:54:04.400]  And I know the people that expose us and post-discovered it, and they just, it would ruin their lives,
[1:54:04.400 --> 1:54:08.520]  because they like, couldn't believe it, they couldn't even believe this was going on.
[1:54:08.520 --> 1:54:12.800]  Because you would never be like that, I would never be like that, but they are.
[1:54:12.800 --> 1:54:18.680]  And now they're all over TV saying, they want to have sex with your one-year-olds, because
[1:54:18.680 --> 1:54:30.320]  you can bet your bottom dollar that they got tortured and raped when they were children.
[1:54:30.320 --> 1:54:35.800]  And a lot of people just decide to adapt to the evil and become what was attacking them.
[1:54:35.800 --> 1:54:39.520]  The majority of people, when put under that type of pressure, and no one saves them and
[1:54:39.520 --> 1:54:45.400]  no one helps them, and they're tortured and raped for years, they become what they fear.
[1:54:45.400 --> 1:54:49.000]  And so just like you take a sword and you heat it up and beat it with hammers and fold
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:55.200]  the metal for Damascus steel, and it takes weeks and weeks and weeks to make that sword,
[1:54:55.200 --> 1:55:01.880]  you make something strong and good, they torture and beat these children until they create
[1:55:01.880 --> 1:55:07.760]  something that is an abomination.
[1:55:07.760 --> 1:55:12.680]  That's why it came out last year, that the CIA would only put people in charge in Afghanistan
[1:55:12.680 --> 1:55:22.080]  that were pedophiles, and that would supply them with little boys and girls.
[1:55:22.080 --> 1:55:23.920]  And there's discrimination against boys.
[1:55:23.920 --> 1:55:26.640]  You wonder why most of the time it's boys being raped?
[1:55:26.640 --> 1:55:29.800]  They found that people will just go crazy on them and start killing people, even inside
[1:55:29.800 --> 1:55:30.800]  their system.
[1:55:30.800 --> 1:55:34.840]  They might rape girls for a couple of years, they'll just suddenly start shooting people,
[1:55:34.840 --> 1:55:39.040]  it's because it's something about little girls, we're built to think of boys as expendable
[1:55:39.040 --> 1:55:42.400]  and be tough, so it's kind of like, well, they're torturing or raping boys, but they're
[1:55:42.400 --> 1:55:46.680]  boys, they can handle it, but people really get flipped out when it's little girls.
[1:55:46.680 --> 1:55:51.960]  So I'd say about 80% of the rape and tortures of little boys, and it's sick, ladies and
[1:55:51.960 --> 1:55:56.680]  gentlemen, and these mothers go to drag queen pedophile time, and they bring their child
[1:55:56.680 --> 1:56:01.200]  to sit on the lap when a man has an erection, and the children and the man humps on them
[1:56:01.200 --> 1:56:04.440]  now, they hump on them on TV, I've shown you the videos.
[1:56:04.440 --> 1:56:09.560]  Big fat man clown outfit, kids laid on top, he lays there and starts humping, the mothers
[1:56:09.560 --> 1:56:11.680]  all get off on the satanicness of it.
[1:56:11.680 --> 1:56:15.240]  This is a satanic energy, we're going to go to break, I'm going to come back, give the
[1:56:15.240 --> 1:56:19.920]  number out, take calls next hour, ahead of Jason Burma's coming up, and I want to think
[1:56:19.920 --> 1:56:22.680]  about the topics I want to throw out, but I do want to take first time callers, so that's
[1:56:22.680 --> 1:56:23.680]  coming up.
[1:56:23.680 --> 1:56:25.200]  I'm not going to give the number out yet, I'll give it out in a moment, I've got a bunch
[1:56:25.200 --> 1:56:28.360]  of topics with my brains all over here, I've got a lot to hit.
[1:56:28.360 --> 1:56:33.760]  Separately, we won't be on air fighting these demons, these murdering psychotic criminals
[1:56:33.760 --> 1:56:36.800]  that we're fighting at point blank range, and then I've got to go out and face every
[1:56:36.800 --> 1:56:41.000]  day, which I'm willing to do, but I need your backing, and I need your prayers, and I need

[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:05.960]  it's not the soil anymore, most of the ocean is contaminated, but when you get high-quality
[1:58:05.960 --> 1:58:11.120]  triiodine, all three of the healthy types together, it does amazing things for your

[1:58:28.760 --> 1:58:33.120]  two weeks to get it on average, you really need to experience X3.
[1:58:33.120 --> 1:58:35.960]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be re-ordering it,
[1:58:35.960 --> 1:58:40.000]  but particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing
[1:58:40.000 --> 1:58:43.400]  what it does for your body, it's the good halogen, not the bad halogen, and it funds
[1:58:43.400 --> 1:58:45.680]  the Infowar, a true 360 win.
[1:58:45.680 --> 1:58:50.880]  So again, X3, back in stock, 50% off for a limited time.
[1:58:50.880 --> 1:58:54.640]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going
[1:58:54.640 --> 1:58:58.160]  on both at home and the world at large.
[1:58:58.160 --> 1:59:02.720]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep
[1:59:02.720 --> 1:59:06.760]  support formula, down and out, is just the thing.
[1:59:06.760 --> 1:59:11.480]  It's our new faster-absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you
[1:59:11.480 --> 1:59:14.280]  get the shut-eye you deserve.
[1:59:14.280 --> 1:59:18.600]  Formulated to improve upon our best-selling product, Knockout, with down and out, now
[1:59:18.600 --> 1:59:24.200]  the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[1:59:24.200 --> 1:59:28.680]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[1:59:28.680 --> 1:59:33.840]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower, which was traditionally
[1:59:33.840 --> 1:59:39.560]  used by Native Americans like the Cherokees, who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[1:59:39.560 --> 1:59:43.840]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep, because you will
[1:59:43.840 --> 1:59:45.840]  be down and out.
[1:59:45.840 --> 1:59:55.520]  We're coming right out now at InfoWarsStore.
[1:59:55.520 --> 2:00:17.040]  All right, I want to open the phones up in this hour for first-time callers to give you
[2:00:17.040 --> 2:00:18.040]  a chance to be on air.
[2:00:18.040 --> 2:00:19.040]  They're really calling about any subjects you want, but just have your point ready and
[2:00:19.040 --> 2:00:23.400]  I'll move the next person so we get to a lot of people.
[2:00:23.400 --> 2:00:26.160]  Dispense with the pleasantries, as they say, because I want to hear from you and the actual
[2:00:26.160 --> 2:00:27.160]  information.
[2:00:27.160 --> 2:00:31.000]  I appreciate you, you appreciate me, those without saying.
[2:00:31.000 --> 2:00:35.680]  But I'm all for these freedom truck convoys, and they're great, and they're wonderful,
[2:00:35.680 --> 2:00:39.000]  and they're breaking the back of the leftist, but now they're saying there's a big one
[2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:45.320]  going to go to D.C., and we've seen trucker and farmer convoys before that went to D.C.,
[2:00:45.320 --> 2:00:47.440]  where the police just outright attacked them.
[2:00:47.440 --> 2:00:52.040]  And I'm concerned Americans are so mad it might not end up having to be a false flag.
[2:00:52.040 --> 2:00:56.000]  People are pissed, and if the cops make the wrong move, this could blow up and get out
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:00:57.000]  of control.
[2:00:57.000 --> 2:00:58.000]  And I don't want that.
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:01.040]  We're beating them politically right now, the globalists are falling apart.
[2:01:01.040 --> 2:01:07.480]  So you can't be paralyzed, though, and not go to D.C. just because you think they're
[2:01:07.480 --> 2:01:09.200]  going to try to set things up.
[2:01:09.200 --> 2:01:12.600]  It's because we weren't thinking about that enough on January 6th and didn't get there
[2:01:12.600 --> 2:01:16.360]  early enough to stop it, and the feds did stand down that this happened.
[2:01:16.360 --> 2:01:21.400]  But I think people are really aware and ready for false flags and stopped any of that type
[2:01:21.400 --> 2:01:25.120]  of behavior we're told in Ottawa and on the U.S. side of the border.
[2:01:25.120 --> 2:01:29.440]  And so I'm all for people peacefully going to D.C. because if you get the point of, well,
[2:01:29.440 --> 2:01:32.440]  they might stage a false flag, then you're paralyzed and they've already won.
[2:01:32.440 --> 2:01:36.400]  But you've just got to have your video cameras, your phone's going, you've got to be peaceful,
[2:01:36.400 --> 2:01:42.480]  you've got to document that, and you've got to just absolutely expose these different
[2:01:42.480 --> 2:01:47.240]  federal groups that black out their license plates and dress in the same khaki pants and
[2:01:47.240 --> 2:01:56.720]  all the rest of it, which are 100% Southern Poverty Law Center ADL Lincoln Project Group
[2:01:56.720 --> 2:01:57.720]  Run.
[2:01:57.720 --> 2:02:00.840]  And the Lincoln Project's been caught out doing it, and they wear the same uniforms
[2:02:00.840 --> 2:02:03.160]  so the police know they're there and the feds know they are.
[2:02:03.160 --> 2:02:07.560]  Yeah, well, that's a group of feds right there, but young cadets have just gotten graduated
[2:02:07.560 --> 2:02:08.560]  out.
[2:02:08.560 --> 2:02:12.560]  But the other folks wear the khakis, they wear the certain color shoes, they wear the
[2:02:12.560 --> 2:02:17.600]  certain color tops, the same sunglasses, and that's a uniform so that they're identifiable
[2:02:17.600 --> 2:02:21.320]  and they all get out of the back of you all's, they all black out their license plates.
[2:02:21.320 --> 2:02:24.240]  And notice the police don't stop them doing that because they've been told leave these
[2:02:24.240 --> 2:02:25.760]  guys alone.
[2:02:25.760 --> 2:02:26.760]  And so that's all they are.
[2:02:26.760 --> 2:02:27.760]  That's what they're doing.
[2:02:27.760 --> 2:02:31.080]  And can you imagine being a piece of garbage like that?
[2:02:31.080 --> 2:02:35.720]  I mean, at this point, because, okay, it's fine to have undercover people out places,
[2:02:35.720 --> 2:02:41.720]  but not when you're there for the media to create a fascist image of the Liberty Movement.
[2:02:41.720 --> 2:02:46.560]  You're now involved in black propaganda that has nothing to do with black people, folks,
[2:02:46.560 --> 2:02:49.240]  the terms white, gray, and black propaganda.
[2:02:49.240 --> 2:02:50.240]  Not all propaganda is bad.
[2:02:50.240 --> 2:02:54.840]  If I'm promoting, you know, my company or my business and saying it has great products,
[2:02:54.840 --> 2:02:57.440]  and that's true, it's white propaganda.
[2:02:57.440 --> 2:03:01.520]  Great propaganda can be promoting something good, but you kind of cheat to sell it.
[2:03:01.520 --> 2:03:04.720]  The idea of the product, that's great propaganda.
[2:03:04.720 --> 2:03:11.920]  Black propaganda is lying to also oppress you and take your freedoms and hurt you.
[2:03:11.920 --> 2:03:13.560]  Sell something good, but lie about it.
[2:03:13.560 --> 2:03:14.560]  That's gray.
[2:03:14.560 --> 2:03:15.560]  Shouldn't do it.
[2:03:15.560 --> 2:03:17.680]  Sell something great, be totally honest about it.
[2:03:17.680 --> 2:03:18.680]  That's white propaganda.
[2:03:18.680 --> 2:03:20.120]  I'm gauging it constantly.
[2:03:20.120 --> 2:03:24.280]  The word propaganda just means to propagate, to promote.
[2:03:24.280 --> 2:03:27.320]  So I am a propaganda machine of the truth.
[2:03:27.320 --> 2:03:29.960]  I'm a propaganda machine of exposing tyranny.
[2:03:29.960 --> 2:03:37.200]  I'm a propaganda machine of spitting truth and facts, and that's what we do.
[2:03:37.200 --> 2:03:44.200]  I'm not perfect, though, and I make mistakes, and I've been hateful, and that is a form
[2:03:44.200 --> 2:03:46.400]  of black propaganda.
[2:03:46.400 --> 2:03:50.160]  Even though it's reasonable to hate these people at the end of the day, we don't want
[2:03:50.160 --> 2:03:52.440]  to fight them because we hate them.
[2:03:52.440 --> 2:03:59.200]  We want to fight them like Ricardo Bossi says for what's behind us, for love.
[2:03:59.200 --> 2:04:04.360]  Hate's not good for you, folks, and it's a good propulsion system, and I've had success
[2:04:04.360 --> 2:04:10.720]  with it, and it's totally natural and wasn't fake, but it's hurt me bad to just burn with
[2:04:10.720 --> 2:04:15.280]  hatred of these people, because I can easily be up here at 7 o'clock, totally exhausted,
[2:04:15.280 --> 2:04:19.800]  see something they've done, and energize, and the crew would ask, are you using drugs?
[2:04:19.800 --> 2:04:20.800]  You were totally...
[2:04:20.800 --> 2:04:21.800]  Did you see this?
[2:04:21.800 --> 2:04:22.800]  I'm pissed off.
[2:04:22.800 --> 2:04:27.840]  That's an inner thing, but that would be hate, and it's hurt me over the years doing
[2:04:27.840 --> 2:04:28.840]  it.
[2:04:28.840 --> 2:04:29.840]  I'm doing it myself now.
[2:04:29.840 --> 2:04:32.080]  I'm doing this for love, and I'm not going to get angry.
[2:04:32.080 --> 2:04:33.680]  I don't have as much energy when I do it, but I'm loving.
[2:04:33.680 --> 2:04:37.480]  I'm doing this for love, and it's usually better what comes out of the love fighting
[2:04:37.480 --> 2:04:41.640]  evil than what comes out of the hate, even though I'm being hateful for a good reason,
[2:04:41.640 --> 2:04:42.640]  and there's a place for hate.
[2:04:42.640 --> 2:04:44.920]  I'm just saying, you don't want to be your main driver.
[2:04:44.920 --> 2:04:49.160]  You want love to be your driver, because it's longer, it's stronger, it's pure, and
[2:04:49.160 --> 2:04:50.640]  at the end, it has better outcomes.
[2:04:50.640 --> 2:04:54.480]  So let's do this for love of our children in the future, not for hate of the global,
[2:04:54.480 --> 2:05:20.520]  but for love of our children in the future, not worth our emotions.
[2:05:20.520 --> 2:05:26.120]  The enemy knows it's powerful and wants to keep you in a psychological, spiritual prison.
[2:05:26.120 --> 2:05:29.480]  This gives you the tools to break out of that system.
[2:05:29.480 --> 2:05:34.000]  This points out the tools that God created and has already given you, but that most people
[2:05:34.000 --> 2:05:36.320]  forgot or never discovered.
[2:05:36.320 --> 2:05:44.520]  Resetwars.com right now has this course, seven hours long, four, 50% off, and your purchase

[2:05:47.080 --> 2:05:49.720]  The only way you fail is not taking action.
[2:05:49.720 --> 2:05:53.240]  This is the most important information I've ever put out, and it's available exclusively
[2:05:53.240 --> 2:05:57.560]  at resetwars.com for 50% off for 72 hours.
[2:05:57.560 --> 2:06:27.360]  All right, listen, I can only play one of these clips earlier in the first hour.
[2:06:27.360 --> 2:06:31.200]  There's a bunch of them, but it's got to be played, and I'm not going to apologize for
[2:06:31.200 --> 2:06:37.360]  playing it, but children should not be listening to this.
[2:06:37.360 --> 2:06:39.560]  But at the same time, people are like, well, then don't play it.
[2:06:39.560 --> 2:06:41.440]  Well, no, this is what's happening to children.
[2:06:41.440 --> 2:06:47.480]  This is what's being done to children, and we need to go ahead and face this.
[2:06:47.480 --> 2:06:53.240]  And I know it's hard, believe me, it's hard to look at these people.
[2:06:53.240 --> 2:06:56.320]  I mean, they're so sick.
[2:06:56.320 --> 2:07:03.480]  You know, when I look at Jeff Zucker or I look at people like, well, just all of them
[2:07:03.480 --> 2:07:08.400]  on their CNN, I mean, we don't just know from the facts, we don't just know from the background
[2:07:08.400 --> 2:07:13.840]  info, we don't just know from the indictments, we know from the whole thing who they are.
[2:07:13.840 --> 2:07:21.080]  And you're talking about people so demonic, so selfish, so sick that they are protecting
[2:07:21.080 --> 2:07:28.160]  this psychic, spiritual, vampiristic cult that is attacking our children.
[2:07:28.160 --> 2:07:34.680]  And folks, there's so much evidence of giant pedophile rings and murder rings that I can't
[2:07:34.680 --> 2:07:37.080]  even research it anymore, okay?
[2:07:37.080 --> 2:07:38.080]  People send it to me.
[2:07:38.080 --> 2:07:39.080]  I'm like, are you going to cover this?
[2:07:39.080 --> 2:07:44.000]  And I just want to throw up, and then I see my innocent children, other people's innocent
[2:07:44.000 --> 2:07:51.480]  children, and I feel like a bad person because I'm not going and finding these people and
[2:07:51.480 --> 2:07:53.320]  physically protecting the children.
[2:07:53.320 --> 2:07:56.920]  But see, they would then be the victims and they would win through that process because
[2:07:56.920 --> 2:07:58.560]  they haven't yet been identified.
[2:07:58.560 --> 2:08:03.800]  But they do need, when they're found to be running pedophile conspiracies to organize
[2:08:03.800 --> 2:08:09.960]  the rape of children executed after they're found guilty, I, they need to have it.
[2:08:09.960 --> 2:08:13.240]  I'm not into cruel and unusual punishment, but I think they should be thrown into like
[2:08:13.240 --> 2:08:16.840]  starving dogs or something, seriously, for what they did to their kids.
[2:08:16.840 --> 2:08:18.320]  And I'm not a vindictive person.
[2:08:18.320 --> 2:08:20.920]  I'm saying they need the fear of God put in them.
[2:08:20.920 --> 2:08:25.920]  They need to watch starving pit bulls rip these people into pieces.
[2:08:25.920 --> 2:08:33.720]  They need to be drawn and quartered by horses.
[2:08:33.720 --> 2:08:38.960]  I mean, they, they sure as hell don't need to be running their mouths on TV how they're
[2:08:38.960 --> 2:08:41.320]  going to have, how it's okay to have sex with one-year-olds.
[2:08:41.320 --> 2:08:44.080]  Do I have to go into how evil that is?
[2:08:44.080 --> 2:08:46.480]  How much it hurts the children physically, mentally, spiritually?
[2:08:46.480 --> 2:08:52.520]  How sick this is and, and, and talking about grandmothers raping their babies because they
[2:08:52.520 --> 2:08:53.520]  love them.
[2:08:53.520 --> 2:09:01.160]  I mean, this is what they tell you.
[2:09:01.160 --> 2:09:02.720]  So what do we do about these people?
[2:09:02.720 --> 2:09:09.840]  Cause I only play one of the clubs and I, I just, I don't know what to say at this point.
[2:09:09.840 --> 2:09:12.720]  It's almost like we become them to even know they're doing this.
[2:09:12.720 --> 2:09:15.120]  Like whoever thought of stuff like this.
[2:09:15.120 --> 2:09:19.640]  Like the Pope said, those that don't want to take vaccines or those that question authority
[2:09:19.640 --> 2:09:24.960]  love to eat poop, where, where does he come up with that?
[2:09:24.960 --> 2:09:28.720]  He's raining down, eating feces into your mind.
[2:09:28.720 --> 2:09:33.320]  And then I've got to say what he said to counter him.
[2:09:33.320 --> 2:09:37.400]  He said it makes him sick in his stomach three years ago to hear about the Christian roots
[2:09:37.400 --> 2:09:40.640]  of Europe.
[2:09:40.640 --> 2:09:42.360]  He's not a Christian leader.
[2:09:42.360 --> 2:09:43.360]  He's a devil.
[2:09:43.360 --> 2:09:45.840]  And I'm not attacking Catholics.
[2:09:45.840 --> 2:09:51.960]  It's all the major institutions are been taken over by devils.
[2:09:51.960 --> 2:09:53.320]  They're sexualizing our children.
[2:09:53.320 --> 2:09:54.800]  They're teaching pedophilia.
[2:09:54.800 --> 2:09:58.040]  They're teaching every form of evil.
[2:09:58.040 --> 2:10:01.180]  They are teaching white children that they are inherently bad.
[2:10:01.180 --> 2:10:06.440]  And that statistically will turn those children into racist.
[2:10:06.440 --> 2:10:07.880]  That's how psychology works.
[2:10:07.880 --> 2:10:12.680]  70, 80% of kids taught they're bad because they're white are going to grow up and resent
[2:10:12.680 --> 2:10:17.600]  the people that did it and actually believe that black people came up with the idea.
[2:10:17.600 --> 2:10:23.120]  It's a bunch of sick, globalist behavioral psychologists, the same ones promoting pedophilia
[2:10:23.120 --> 2:10:30.080]  that are raining that type of crap down.
[2:10:30.080 --> 2:10:33.400]  And they're literally saying white people are inherently evil, so they deserve to be
[2:10:33.400 --> 2:10:35.240]  killed and robbed.
[2:10:35.240 --> 2:10:41.520]  And so we go from 10 to one black on white crime to 20 to one black on white crime.
[2:10:41.520 --> 2:10:45.080]  And still the vast majority of black folks aren't racist, aren't tribal, don't want to
[2:10:45.080 --> 2:10:46.880]  kill white people.
[2:10:46.880 --> 2:10:52.200]  But there's a large minority of idiot black men that believe it and go out and do it because
[2:10:52.200 --> 2:10:54.200]  they think whites deserve it.
[2:10:54.200 --> 2:11:08.120]  And that's all the evil globalist manipulating that to destroy all of us.
[2:11:08.120 --> 2:11:09.800]  I don't want the black babies aborted.
[2:11:09.800 --> 2:11:11.480]  I don't want the white babies aborted.
[2:11:11.480 --> 2:11:16.040]  I don't want some guy that claimed he was black running over a bunch of people in the
[2:11:16.040 --> 2:11:17.040]  media covering it up.
[2:11:17.040 --> 2:11:20.520]  I don't want a white guy going to church and shooting and killing non-black people.
[2:11:20.520 --> 2:11:24.480]  I don't want any of this dumbass evil garbage anymore.
[2:11:24.480 --> 2:11:29.120]  And I'm asking listeners, what do we do to stop these people?
[2:11:29.120 --> 2:11:38.600]  I mean, look at this New York SUNY professor calling it libertarian and saying one-year-old
[2:11:38.600 --> 2:11:44.080]  babies can consent to being raped.
[2:11:44.080 --> 2:11:49.440]  And he's up there with a bunch of other people that just...
[2:11:49.440 --> 2:11:53.280]  I mean, just look at that dude.
[2:11:53.280 --> 2:11:55.800]  They got to look, man.
[2:11:55.800 --> 2:11:57.960]  Look at that guy.
[2:11:57.960 --> 2:12:02.320]  Does he not look like the former mayor of New York, de Blasio?
[2:12:02.320 --> 2:12:06.440]  Does he not look like all these guys?
[2:12:06.440 --> 2:12:08.960]  All these guys?
[2:12:08.960 --> 2:12:11.600]  And he could be black, he could be white, he could be...
[2:12:11.600 --> 2:12:16.600]  They all got that weird, demonic look.
[2:12:16.600 --> 2:12:19.480]  They're predators.
[2:12:19.480 --> 2:12:24.840]  Whether he actually acts on the things he talks about or whether he's just putting
[2:12:24.840 --> 2:12:28.600]  the poison out to legitimize it for his fellow travelers, it doesn't matter.
[2:12:28.600 --> 2:12:34.440]  They're raping our souls and they're putting mask over our children and telling them they're
[2:12:34.440 --> 2:12:37.360]  bad and indoctrinating them in the schools and brainwashing them.
[2:12:37.360 --> 2:12:42.320]  And Brian Stoker goes and says, don't believe Alex Jones and Marjorie Taylor Green on CNN
[2:12:42.320 --> 2:12:48.560]  to little kids held captive in New York by this network of filth that want to destroy
[2:12:48.560 --> 2:12:53.400]  our children, our borders, our currency, our future, because they are a psychic, satanic
[2:12:53.400 --> 2:13:02.360]  virus or poison injected into the body politic to kill and destroy us, as the Bible says.
[2:13:02.360 --> 2:13:07.080]  I'll give the number out in a moment, but let's play this clip 13.
[2:13:07.080 --> 2:13:08.760]  The others are too horrible to play.
[2:13:08.760 --> 2:13:10.280]  Imagine how bad they are.
[2:13:10.280 --> 2:13:11.280]  Here it is.
[2:13:11.280 --> 2:13:13.720]  There's a couple of things to say here.
[2:13:13.720 --> 2:13:17.600]  One is, even if you are looking for a threshold, let's say there's a threshold, I'm making
[2:13:17.600 --> 2:13:20.160]  this number up, but let's say it's at age eight.
[2:13:20.160 --> 2:13:24.480]  Still, that tells you that some adult child sex is permissible.
[2:13:24.480 --> 2:13:31.240]  Second, the notion that it's wrong, even one of the one year old is not quite obvious
[2:13:31.240 --> 2:13:32.240]  to me.
[2:13:32.240 --> 2:13:37.520]  There are reports in some cultures of grandmothers filading their baby boys to calm them down
[2:13:37.520 --> 2:13:38.520]  when a colloquy.
[2:13:38.520 --> 2:13:42.880]  Now, I don't know if this is true, but this is why the report is occurring in at least
[2:13:42.880 --> 2:13:43.880]  one culture.
[2:13:43.880 --> 2:13:44.880]  It's working.
[2:13:44.880 --> 2:13:47.440]  The grandmothers believe this actually works.
[2:13:47.440 --> 2:13:52.040]  If this were to be true, and again, I don't know if it's true, if it were to be true,
[2:13:52.040 --> 2:13:54.120]  it's hard to see what would be wrong with it.
[2:13:54.120 --> 2:13:59.880]  So, yeah, I guess I think, no, I don't think there's a blanket period beyond which this
[2:13:59.880 --> 2:14:00.880]  is permissible.
[2:14:00.880 --> 2:14:06.320]  If we're interested in willing participation, which is the way I structured it, then yeah,
[2:14:06.320 --> 2:14:09.920]  there's a point below which people aren't willing participants in anything because they
[2:14:09.920 --> 2:14:14.480]  don't have intentions or they don't have the sort of mental states that allow for willing
[2:14:14.480 --> 2:14:15.980]  participation.
[2:14:15.980 --> 2:14:19.200]  But no, I don't think there's a blanket wrong at any age.
[2:14:19.200 --> 2:14:23.360]  Imagine that an adult male wants to have sex with a 12-year-old girl.
[2:14:23.360 --> 2:14:24.360]  I just turned it off.
[2:14:24.360 --> 2:14:29.640]  I mean, it just goes on into how it's a good thing biologically and evolutionarily for
[2:14:29.640 --> 2:14:32.080]  children to have sex with adults as young as one-year-old.
[2:14:32.080 --> 2:14:35.840]  That's just not true.
[2:14:35.840 --> 2:14:39.960]  But you want to have people so unnatural and so turned around and so screwed up that they're
[2:14:39.960 --> 2:14:42.360]  brought up in this believing it's the new way.
[2:14:42.360 --> 2:14:49.360]  That's what the left and Harvard and the Carnegie CIA group did in Germany.
[2:14:49.360 --> 2:14:53.320]  Of course, Putin said 12 years ago, you can't have any more Russian orphans.
[2:14:53.320 --> 2:14:55.160]  We found out you're putting them in sex rings.
[2:14:55.160 --> 2:14:59.480]  The media's like, how dare Putin say that there's sex rings with these kids because
[2:14:59.480 --> 2:15:04.480]  they turned out there were.
[2:15:04.480 --> 2:15:09.560]  You want to get cut off from God, hurt children, and that's why these people all look so weak
[2:15:09.560 --> 2:15:13.160]  and their eyes look so dead is because they're cut off from God.
[2:15:13.160 --> 2:15:15.360]  You don't get power serving Satan.
[2:15:15.360 --> 2:15:17.120]  You become a slave of Satan.
[2:15:17.120 --> 2:15:20.880]  But if you serve God, you're going to get a lot of power, but you're going to have a
[2:15:20.880 --> 2:15:24.520]  lot of responsibility, and you're going to have emissions, and it ain't the candy-ass
[2:15:24.520 --> 2:15:26.960]  around and be loved by this world.
[2:15:26.960 --> 2:15:30.960]  We're in the world dot of it.
[2:15:30.960 --> 2:15:47.160]  Total free number to join us is 877-789-ALIX, 877-789-ALIX, 877-789-ALIX, 877-789-2539.
[2:15:47.160 --> 2:15:51.560]  We will come back and take your phone calls for first-time callers on what do we do about
[2:15:51.560 --> 2:15:52.560]  these people?
[2:15:52.560 --> 2:15:53.560]  Stay with us.
[2:15:53.560 --> 2:15:54.560]  We'll be right back.
[2:15:54.560 --> 2:16:03.840]  Whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault
[2:16:03.840 --> 2:16:09.240]  on our democracy, we will follow the facts wherever they lead.
[2:16:09.240 --> 2:16:12.240]  Domestic terrorists.
[2:16:12.240 --> 2:16:14.840]  The days of independent media are numbered.
[2:16:14.840 --> 2:16:17.560]  The government has made it illegal to oppose them.
[2:16:17.560 --> 2:16:20.840]  They are now deep banking us behind the scenes.
[2:16:20.840 --> 2:16:26.720]  They want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly, with practically half the population
[2:16:26.720 --> 2:16:29.760]  wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps.
[2:16:29.760 --> 2:16:34.760]  The traders know they can shut us down by force, but that would accelerate the awakening
[2:16:34.760 --> 2:16:36.260]  exponentially.
[2:16:36.260 --> 2:16:37.260]  So be it.
[2:16:37.260 --> 2:16:40.200]  Make them silence us by force.
[2:16:40.200 --> 2:16:43.280]  This is the final battle of the Information War.
[2:16:43.280 --> 2:16:44.280]  Give now.
[2:16:44.280 --> 2:16:45.280]  Buy products.
[2:16:45.280 --> 2:16:46.280]  Donate.
[2:16:46.280 --> 2:16:47.280]  Before everything changes.
[2:16:47.280 --> 2:16:51.720]  We need you to carry us through to the end.
[2:16:51.720 --> 2:16:55.720]  Victory or death, go now to infowarstore.com.
[2:16:55.720 --> 2:17:02.400]  If you're ruthless mega corporations who've taken over almost every government on earth
[2:17:02.400 --> 2:17:07.560]  and who are trying to destroy the middle class in any form of upper mobility, you've got
[2:17:07.560 --> 2:17:10.880]  to divide and conquer the public so they don't know they're being targeted.
[2:17:10.880 --> 2:17:17.360]  And that's why the Fortune 100 have wrapped themselves, the name of LBGT, African American
[2:17:17.360 --> 2:17:19.920]  rights, and all the rest of it, all over the world.
[2:17:19.920 --> 2:17:23.920]  That's now their corporate face while they run slave camps in Africa and in communist
[2:17:23.920 --> 2:17:28.800]  China and many other areas, while they undermine our basic liberties here and spy on us through
[2:17:28.800 --> 2:17:31.680]  the big tech and the central banks and other zone.
[2:17:31.680 --> 2:17:38.320]  So this is a criminal takeover, and when you look at the new superclass, it's the politicians,
[2:17:38.320 --> 2:17:42.960]  the corporate media, it's the police, it's the bureaucrats, it's members of Congress
[2:17:42.960 --> 2:17:47.200]  and their staff, and their families, it's the White House, hell it's postal workers
[2:17:47.200 --> 2:17:53.000]  who were all exempt from the poison shots, but not the general public and everybody else
[2:17:53.000 --> 2:17:54.680]  through corporate rule.
[2:17:54.680 --> 2:17:57.560]  So this is the true discrimination that's going on.
[2:17:57.560 --> 2:18:00.400]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[2:18:00.400 --> 2:18:04.800]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide,
[2:18:04.800 --> 2:18:10.680]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech, government are stealing all of your data and
[2:18:10.680 --> 2:18:14.360]  creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[2:18:14.360 --> 2:18:19.320]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[2:18:19.320 --> 2:18:23.440]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts,
[2:18:23.440 --> 2:18:27.720]  protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[2:18:27.720 --> 2:18:30.400]  That's why everybody should visit infowarstore.com.
[2:18:30.400 --> 2:18:37.720]  We're carrying a huge new line of very compliant, made in America products that have 100% reviews

[2:18:45.280 --> 2:18:46.280]  globalists.

[2:18:50.920 --> 2:18:51.920]  Check out the new line.
[2:18:51.920 --> 2:19:01.920]  It's amazing.
[2:19:01.920 --> 2:19:22.920]  It's amazing.
[2:19:22.920 --> 2:19:44.220]  Thank you.
[2:19:52.920 --> 2:20:18.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:18.920 --> 2:20:30.920]  Sarah Jones from 1810 to 1913 made his great-grandchildren believe you could live to 103.
[2:20:30.920 --> 2:20:34.920]  103 is forever when you were a child.
[2:20:34.920 --> 2:20:38.920]  That's how old mine dad's grandmother was.
[2:20:38.920 --> 2:20:40.920]  Sarah Jones lived forever.
[2:20:40.920 --> 2:20:42.920]  She was maw Jones.
[2:20:42.920 --> 2:20:44.920]  Her real name was Moon Jones.
[2:20:44.920 --> 2:20:49.920]  When you dig my grave, would you make a shallow?
[2:20:49.920 --> 2:20:51.920]  So I can feel the rain.
[2:20:51.920 --> 2:20:52.920]  So I can feel all the rain.
[2:20:52.920 --> 2:20:54.920]  It was the full moon when she was born.
[2:20:54.920 --> 2:20:55.920]  All the rain.
[2:20:55.920 --> 2:20:56.920]  Grave digger.
[2:20:56.920 --> 2:20:57.920]  Grave digger.
[2:20:57.920 --> 2:21:01.920]  Outlived all four of her five sons.
[2:21:01.920 --> 2:21:02.920]  One lived longer than her.
[2:21:02.920 --> 2:21:07.920]  Bureau of Stonewall, little three to 1954.
[2:21:07.920 --> 2:21:08.920]  I'm telling you.
[2:21:08.920 --> 2:21:12.920]  She lost both of her babies in the Second Great War.
[2:21:12.920 --> 2:21:16.920]  Those guys all were like John Wayne, man.
[2:21:16.920 --> 2:21:19.920]  I can definitely see men degenerate and get weaker.
[2:21:19.920 --> 2:21:22.920]  That's a sad thing.
[2:21:22.920 --> 2:21:24.920]  Humanity's falling, folks.
[2:21:24.920 --> 2:21:26.920]  We're degenerating quickly.
[2:21:26.920 --> 2:21:29.920]  I see how far humans have fallen.
[2:21:29.920 --> 2:21:34.920]  Makes you really believe the Old Testament that some people live to be 500, 600 years old.
[2:21:34.920 --> 2:21:36.920]  You know, they've dug up people in Africa.
[2:21:36.920 --> 2:21:40.920]  They've dug up people in ancient England.
[2:21:40.920 --> 2:21:43.920]  They've dug up people from four or 5,000 years ago.
[2:21:43.920 --> 2:21:47.920]  And they're twice as strong as we are today, our best athletes.
[2:21:47.920 --> 2:21:48.920]  What's happening to us?
[2:21:48.920 --> 2:21:49.920]  What's happening to the whole planet?
[2:21:49.920 --> 2:21:52.920]  The planet's dying.
[2:21:52.920 --> 2:21:53.920]  And the globalists know that.
[2:21:53.920 --> 2:22:00.920]  They're helping kill it for whatever their big, evil, satanic plan is.
[2:22:00.920 --> 2:22:06.920]  Only God and Satan know what's going on in that sick brain, that sick mind.
[2:22:06.920 --> 2:22:09.920]  But they claim they're the ones protecting the earth while they do all this.
[2:22:09.920 --> 2:22:16.920]  That's not the case, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:22:16.920 --> 2:22:18.920]  It's bad.
[2:22:18.920 --> 2:22:27.920]  And you don't need me to sit up here on some high horse and tell you that everything the New World Order pushes is pure death.
[2:22:27.920 --> 2:22:30.920]  And needs to be rejected.
[2:22:30.920 --> 2:22:32.920]  And not just physical death, but spiritual death.
[2:22:32.920 --> 2:22:39.920]  Now, I want to take your calls, Michael, and Joseph, and Duke, and Christian, and Gene, and Moxie, and Neil, and Daniel.
[2:22:39.920 --> 2:22:42.920]  And that's the calls we're going to take, those.
[2:22:42.920 --> 2:22:43.920]  We'll get to all of them.
[2:22:43.920 --> 2:22:47.920]  Even if I take some of Burma's this time, and he's always informative, so I don't want to cut too much in on him.
[2:22:47.920 --> 2:22:53.920]  But I need to hit at least some of these headlines here and some of these big developments,
[2:22:53.920 --> 2:22:56.920]  because this is really important stuff.
[2:22:56.920 --> 2:23:07.920]  But first off, I was thinking about the Bible verse that we are wonderfully and fearfully made.
[2:23:07.920 --> 2:23:12.920]  I mean, making a human with conscious will and what we can do, that's like a...
[2:23:12.920 --> 2:23:15.920]  Bingle Tiger is beautiful and fearful.
[2:23:15.920 --> 2:23:17.920]  And you think, oh, that's a scary damn thing right there.
[2:23:17.920 --> 2:23:19.920]  Well, so are we.
[2:23:19.920 --> 2:23:21.920]  A lot more powerful than a Bingle Tiger.
[2:23:21.920 --> 2:23:23.920]  Or an elephant.
[2:23:23.920 --> 2:23:26.920]  Or an Osiris, because of our mind.
[2:23:26.920 --> 2:23:31.920]  But I was thinking about in Revelation and also in earlier books, as it always foreshadows,
[2:23:31.920 --> 2:23:39.920]  that when Satan's finally bound for a thousand years before he's released again to test us again for a very short time,
[2:23:39.920 --> 2:23:47.920]  that people will marble and look at him in the hologram in the pit in his cell, in that black hole,
[2:23:47.920 --> 2:23:53.920]  and say, that's the creature? So let's pull up the footage from yesterday, just a short 40-second clip,
[2:23:53.920 --> 2:23:57.920]  not the longer babbling of George Soros that he believes he's the Messiah,
[2:23:57.920 --> 2:24:00.920]  who loves to steal old people's pension funds.
[2:24:00.920 --> 2:24:02.920]  I mean, he's a horrible person.
[2:24:02.920 --> 2:24:04.920]  So upset about G.G. Ping.
[2:24:04.920 --> 2:24:07.920]  And I mean, look, look, that's the thing that did all this to us.
[2:24:07.920 --> 2:24:10.920]  See, everything the Bible explains is a foreshadowing of the final event.
[2:24:10.920 --> 2:24:12.920]  There are many Antichrists.
[2:24:12.920 --> 2:24:14.920]  There are many Satanists. There are many devils.
[2:24:14.920 --> 2:24:17.920]  There isn't one final personification of it, but it's one spirit.
[2:24:17.920 --> 2:24:21.920]  And there it is. That's the thing that did this to us.
[2:24:21.920 --> 2:24:23.920]  That's the thing that we can't defeat.
[2:24:23.920 --> 2:24:25.920]  Pelosi, Biden.
[2:24:25.920 --> 2:24:28.920]  Get that other Biden clip of him.
[2:24:28.920 --> 2:24:33.920]  Literally not knowing where he is at a factory with a bunch of other people.
[2:24:33.920 --> 2:24:36.920]  Nothing against blind folks, but there's a blind guy and some other people shuffling around,
[2:24:36.920 --> 2:24:41.920]  and Biden doesn't know where he is, and it's the perfect medieval image.
[2:24:41.920 --> 2:24:46.920]  I got a painting of it hanging over there in one of my offices of the blind leading the blind.
[2:24:46.920 --> 2:24:49.920]  Guys, pull up the medieval painting of the blind leading the blind.
[2:24:49.920 --> 2:24:52.920]  It's a Renaissance painting. It's about 400 years old.
[2:24:52.920 --> 2:24:58.920]  But the point is, is that I don't have a copy.
[2:24:58.920 --> 2:25:00.920]  I don't have a real Renaissance saying it's 400 years old.
[2:25:00.920 --> 2:25:02.920]  The actual one of you find it.
[2:25:02.920 --> 2:25:06.920]  It's like a hole, and there's some blind people holding on to sticks falling.
[2:25:06.920 --> 2:25:08.920]  There it is. It's the blind leading the blind.
[2:25:08.920 --> 2:25:13.920]  It's in our conference room. That's the New World Order.
[2:25:13.920 --> 2:25:17.920]  So just imagine, and look at the general public that's addicted to their phones,
[2:25:17.920 --> 2:25:20.920]  addicted to all the media, addicted to porn, all of it.
[2:25:20.920 --> 2:25:26.920]  They all have that weird zombie look. They're spiritually blind.
[2:25:26.920 --> 2:25:33.920]  So here's Soros. This is out of Isaiah chapter 14.
[2:25:33.920 --> 2:25:38.920]  How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning.
[2:25:38.920 --> 2:25:46.920]  How art thou cut down to the ground, which just weaken the nations.
[2:25:46.920 --> 2:25:51.920]  They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying,
[2:25:51.920 --> 2:25:55.920]  Is this the man that made the earth to tremble?
[2:25:55.920 --> 2:25:57.920]  That did shake kingdoms?
[2:25:57.920 --> 2:26:01.920]  That made the world as a wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof?
[2:26:01.920 --> 2:26:06.920]  What's happening now? That opened not the house of prisoners?
[2:26:06.920 --> 2:26:10.920]  All the kings of the nations, even all of them lie in glory,
[2:26:10.920 --> 2:26:16.920]  every one in his own house.
[2:26:16.920 --> 2:26:19.920]  Here's Revelation chapter 21 through 3.
[2:26:19.920 --> 2:26:24.920]  And I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit
[2:26:24.920 --> 2:26:30.920]  and the great chain in his hand, and he laid hold on the dragon.
[2:26:30.920 --> 2:26:34.920]  The old serpent, which is the devil and Satan,
[2:26:34.920 --> 2:26:39.920]  and bound him a thousand years and cast him into the bottomless pit
[2:26:39.920 --> 2:26:47.920]  and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the nations no more.
[2:26:47.920 --> 2:26:50.920]  Still, the thousand years should be fulfilled,
[2:26:50.920 --> 2:26:59.920]  and after that he must be loosed a little season.
[2:26:59.920 --> 2:27:03.920]  Let's look at an echo, a psychic echo of Satan.
[2:27:03.920 --> 2:27:07.920]  This is Satan. This is our enemy. Look how pathetic he is.
[2:27:07.920 --> 2:27:13.920]  C.G. Wing has done his best to dismantle Jeng Xiaoping's achievements.
[2:27:13.920 --> 2:27:20.920]  He brought private companies established under Deng under the control of the CCP
[2:27:20.920 --> 2:27:26.920]  and undermined the dynamism that used to characterize them.
[2:27:26.920 --> 2:27:31.920]  Rather than letting private enterprise blossom,
[2:27:31.920 --> 2:27:39.920]  C.G. Wing introduced his own China dream that can be summed up in two words,
[2:27:39.920 --> 2:27:45.920]  total control. That has had disastrous consequences.
[2:27:45.920 --> 2:27:50.920]  Why do we associate in art types really wicked evil ones as super old?
[2:27:50.920 --> 2:27:53.920]  Because a beautiful soul is beautiful when they're old,
[2:27:53.920 --> 2:27:58.920]  but evil wants to hold on to power and doesn't translate it to new generations.
[2:27:58.920 --> 2:28:01.920]  The real goal is to become obsolete and build up people better than you.
[2:28:01.920 --> 2:28:03.920]  But see, these evil ones, they don't want that.
[2:28:03.920 --> 2:28:06.920]  They want to hold it on. That's why they won't go away
[2:28:06.920 --> 2:28:10.920]  until the moment they lose the sector of power, like that skexie in the dark crystal.
[2:28:10.920 --> 2:28:13.920]  Speaking of skexies, here's Biden.
[2:28:13.920 --> 2:28:30.920]  And the way Biden is a total empty puppet,
[2:28:30.920 --> 2:28:33.920]  not knowing where he is or what he's going,
[2:28:33.920 --> 2:28:36.920]  that's who they want you to be a robot for them,
[2:28:36.920 --> 2:28:40.920]  because Satan is a failed creature.
[2:28:40.920 --> 2:28:43.920]  You're more advanced, you're more beautiful, you're better,
[2:28:43.920 --> 2:28:48.920]  but you are in an embryonic level and he is enraged with jealousy and envy
[2:28:48.920 --> 2:28:52.920]  because you were made by his creator in the image of that creator.
[2:28:52.920 --> 2:28:56.920]  Realize that your power is with God.
[2:28:56.920 --> 2:29:01.920]  Sold out for months, X3 is now back in stock.
[2:29:01.920 --> 2:29:04.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing,
[2:29:04.920 --> 2:29:09.920]  our products are game changing and so many people are deficient in iodide.
[2:29:09.920 --> 2:29:12.920]  It's not the soil anymore, most of the ocean is contaminated,
[2:29:12.920 --> 2:29:17.920]  but when you get high quality triiodine, all three of the healthy types together,
[2:29:17.920 --> 2:29:21.920]  it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido,
[2:29:21.920 --> 2:29:23.920]  but most importantly your immune system.
[2:29:23.920 --> 2:29:27.920]  So, X3, the only triiodine on the market,
[2:29:27.920 --> 2:29:33.920]  highest grade, is now exclusively available again at 50%off at mforestore.com.
[2:29:33.920 --> 2:29:36.920]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine,
[2:29:36.920 --> 2:29:38.920]  and what it does for your body, it takes about two weeks to kick in on average,
[2:29:38.920 --> 2:29:41.920]  you really need to experience X3.
[2:29:41.920 --> 2:29:44.920]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it,
[2:29:44.920 --> 2:29:47.920]  but particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it
[2:29:47.920 --> 2:29:49.920]  because it's amazing what it does for your body,
[2:29:49.920 --> 2:29:51.920]  it's the good halogen, it's not the bad halogen,
[2:29:51.920 --> 2:29:54.920]  and it funds the M4 for a true 360 win.
[2:29:54.920 --> 2:29:57.920]  So again, X3, back in stock, 50%off for a limited time.
[2:29:57.920 --> 2:30:01.920]  U.N. run contact tracers aren't coming, they're here,
[2:30:01.920 --> 2:30:05.920]  all over the world from Australia to the United States, from Canada to Germany.
[2:30:05.920 --> 2:30:08.920]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go,
[2:30:08.920 --> 2:30:11.920]  and then coming to your house and threatening in some cases,
[2:30:11.920 --> 2:30:15.920]  actually taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[2:30:15.920 --> 2:30:19.920]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process
[2:30:19.920 --> 2:30:22.920]  where they come and take, quote, healthy people away
[2:30:22.920 --> 2:30:24.920]  and put them in facilities for their safety.
[2:30:24.920 --> 2:30:26.920]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[2:30:26.920 --> 2:30:30.920]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages,
[2:30:30.920 --> 2:30:33.920]  many of which are made here in America and are very compliant,
[2:30:33.920 --> 2:30:37.920]  meaning U.S. government military grade at infowarstore.com.

[2:31:01.920 --> 2:31:04.920]  with the globalists plotting their next big lockdown,
[2:31:04.920 --> 2:31:08.920]  with the next phase of the Great Reset being a stage cyber attack,
[2:31:08.920 --> 2:31:12.920]  with the deep state pushing a civil war, not just here,
[2:31:12.920 --> 2:31:15.920]  but in Europe and war with Russia,
[2:31:15.920 --> 2:31:19.920]  with the massive inflation and all the other garbage that's taking place
[2:31:19.920 --> 2:31:21.920]  like supply chain breakdowns,
[2:31:21.920 --> 2:31:27.920]  you need to get prepared now with high quality, storable food that is ready to ship.
[2:31:27.920 --> 2:31:31.920]  And it's been four years since my patriot supply at preparewithalix.com
[2:31:31.920 --> 2:31:37.920]  has offered their storable food at 25% off, four years.
[2:31:37.920 --> 2:31:42.920]  But right now, it's 25% off until February 13th, 2022,
[2:31:42.920 --> 2:31:47.920]  a little over two weeks from the time I'm cutting this to get 25% off
[2:31:47.920 --> 2:31:52.920]  at preparewithalix.com on the entire catalog of my patriot supply.
[2:31:52.920 --> 2:31:54.920]  Act now, get prepared now.
[2:31:54.920 --> 2:31:58.920]  It's absolutely essential for everybody that wants to be self-sufficient.
[2:32:24.920 --> 2:32:29.920]  The growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses
[2:32:29.920 --> 2:32:32.920]  in joints and the digestive system.
[2:32:32.920 --> 2:32:37.920]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil
[2:32:37.920 --> 2:32:43.920]  can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[2:32:43.920 --> 2:32:45.920]  It worked for my family,
[2:32:45.920 --> 2:32:52.920]  and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[2:32:52.920 --> 2:32:58.920]  Visit your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at infowarsstore.com
[2:32:58.920 --> 2:33:23.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:23.920 --> 2:33:49.920]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:49.920 --> 2:34:00.920]  You can play this song to Foxes, or Eagles, or any other type of parrot you want,
[2:34:00.920 --> 2:34:04.920]  and they'll all dance the same way it does.
[2:34:04.920 --> 2:34:10.920]  It's all God's language, music.
[2:34:10.920 --> 2:34:30.920]  There's a little part about going to the church that we're going to go to your phone call.
[2:34:30.920 --> 2:34:38.920]  Here we are, ladies and gentlemen, on the edge of eternity.
[2:34:38.920 --> 2:34:42.920]  And then you realize there is no edge of eternity, you're already at eternity.
[2:34:42.920 --> 2:34:45.920]  You already are totally complete.
[2:34:45.920 --> 2:34:48.920]  You just have to reach out and take that desk in your hands.
[2:34:48.920 --> 2:34:53.920]  I have been to the other side, I have been to completion.
[2:34:53.920 --> 2:34:58.920]  I am not complete, but I have tasted of completion.
[2:34:58.920 --> 2:35:06.920]  Beyond fullness, beyond ecstasy, beyond timelessness, absolute, total completion,
[2:35:06.920 --> 2:35:13.920]  contentment beyond the term even zen, I have felt it.
[2:35:13.920 --> 2:35:21.920]  And once you have tapped into that eternity of eternities, of eternities, of eternities,
[2:35:21.920 --> 2:35:28.920]  of eternities, of eternities, you will then finally transcend what's happened on this planet.
[2:35:28.920 --> 2:35:34.920]  But unlike what some of the Hindus and others teach, they say, well, you know, it's a process.
[2:35:34.920 --> 2:35:38.920]  People are dumb and they're losing their souls and they're becoming like animals,
[2:35:38.920 --> 2:35:43.920]  so they'll be destroyed, that's a process.
[2:35:43.920 --> 2:35:46.920]  So don't feel bad about it.
[2:35:46.920 --> 2:35:49.920]  Just be glad you're awake.
[2:35:49.920 --> 2:35:51.920]  That's a deception.
[2:35:51.920 --> 2:35:54.920]  I'm not picking fights with Hindus and people like that.
[2:35:54.920 --> 2:36:00.920]  I've just read what they say and understood what they say is totally true to a certain point.
[2:36:00.920 --> 2:36:05.920]  But you're not reincarnated from the same thing back again.
[2:36:05.920 --> 2:36:09.920]  You're already eternal.
[2:36:09.920 --> 2:36:20.920]  And the only thing that's composite is our spirit's collective creation on this planet as our project
[2:36:20.920 --> 2:36:26.920]  so that we can build composites of ourselves together in communion,
[2:36:26.920 --> 2:36:30.920]  as God created us for communion with Him.
[2:36:30.920 --> 2:36:38.920]  And so, yes, the genetic line of humans is a composite of our multi-dimensional energy forces
[2:36:38.920 --> 2:36:48.920]  manifesting on this planet and then building an organized structure according to our time-space vision.
[2:36:48.920 --> 2:36:57.920]  And so that colony entity is individual and is transcendent and is a connection to our higher selves,
[2:36:57.920 --> 2:37:02.920]  but it itself is a lower creation from who we are.
[2:37:02.920 --> 2:37:04.920]  You're not going to read this stuff in books, folks.
[2:37:04.920 --> 2:37:06.920]  You're not going to see this anywhere.
[2:37:06.920 --> 2:37:10.920]  This stuff is what enrages the enemy because they have a good idea, but they haven't been there.
[2:37:10.920 --> 2:37:13.920]  They've not seen it.
[2:37:13.920 --> 2:37:17.920]  And they know that if you realize this, it's came over from them.
[2:37:17.920 --> 2:37:23.920]  They are weaponizing the medical system to attack your double helix and try to cut that off
[2:37:23.920 --> 2:37:30.920]  because when you go into times of crisis, all those ancestral memories of your kindred spirits,
[2:37:30.920 --> 2:37:34.920]  the energy God created of other souls, are going to be here with you.
[2:37:34.920 --> 2:37:38.920]  Just like you love your children and they love you and you love your grandparents and they love you
[2:37:38.920 --> 2:37:41.920]  and you have this feeling that they're there with you.
[2:37:41.920 --> 2:37:43.920]  That's not a ghost.
[2:37:43.920 --> 2:37:46.920]  That's not Casper walking through walls, folks.
[2:37:46.920 --> 2:37:52.920]  It's a reflection of their genetics and that code in you that resonates.
[2:37:52.920 --> 2:37:59.920]  They've gone on to the higher plane, but they have left their copy of their essence with you
[2:37:59.920 --> 2:38:07.920]  as your shield, as your blanket, as your refuge, just like God gave us the planet.
[2:38:07.920 --> 2:38:11.920]  That's how beautiful God is.
[2:38:11.920 --> 2:38:13.920]  And so people go, I have these memories.
[2:38:13.920 --> 2:38:14.920]  I know about ancient times.
[2:38:14.920 --> 2:38:17.920]  I know I already know about these weapons and I know how to do this.
[2:38:17.920 --> 2:38:18.920]  I already know how to...
[2:38:18.920 --> 2:38:21.920]  I'm 12 years old, but I know how to go and pick up a 25-year-old woman if I wanted to.
[2:38:21.920 --> 2:38:24.920]  Why am I a man and I'm 12 years old?
[2:38:24.920 --> 2:38:26.920]  Why do I know all this stuff?
[2:38:26.920 --> 2:38:32.920]  Because God gives us free will, but God doesn't leave us alone.
[2:38:32.920 --> 2:38:35.920]  I'm going to call it cheating, but God gives us an owner's manual.
[2:38:35.920 --> 2:38:37.920]  God gives us the training.
[2:38:37.920 --> 2:38:41.920]  God gives us the instincts, the common sense, the will, the...
[2:38:41.920 --> 2:38:42.920]  What's the term?
[2:38:42.920 --> 2:38:44.920]  The conscience.
[2:38:44.920 --> 2:38:47.920]  To know what's right and to know what's good.
[2:38:47.920 --> 2:38:52.920]  And if we simply go with that conscience and go with that program, because we have free will,
[2:38:52.920 --> 2:38:57.920]  but God says, listen, I'm not going to just throw you into this thing and not give you the secret.
[2:38:57.920 --> 2:39:03.920]  I'm going to give you everything you need and I love you and...
[2:39:03.920 --> 2:39:07.920]  I created you because I care about you.
[2:39:07.920 --> 2:39:09.920]  I love this headset, but man, this clip...
[2:39:09.920 --> 2:39:11.920]  See, I don't need a new headset.
[2:39:11.920 --> 2:39:13.920]  It's not the earpiece I hate.
[2:39:13.920 --> 2:39:14.920]  The crew thinks I hate that.
[2:39:14.920 --> 2:39:15.920]  They're ordering like a molded piece.
[2:39:15.920 --> 2:39:17.920]  It's the clip.
[2:39:17.920 --> 2:39:19.920]  This new clip...
[2:39:19.920 --> 2:39:21.920]  I said this off air, but nobody seems to understand me, so I'll say it on air.
[2:39:21.920 --> 2:39:23.920]  It's this clip.
[2:39:23.920 --> 2:39:25.920]  This clip is the issue.
[2:39:25.920 --> 2:39:27.920]  It's the clip.
[2:39:27.920 --> 2:39:31.920]  Man, I'm just like, God, the damn thing falls off like five times a day, man.
[2:39:31.920 --> 2:39:33.920]  You don't touch it, nothing, and it falls off.
[2:39:33.920 --> 2:39:35.920]  So they're like, we'll get you a new earpiece, sir, we're sorry.
[2:39:35.920 --> 2:39:36.920]  You don't like the earpiece.
[2:39:36.920 --> 2:39:38.920]  I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[2:39:38.920 --> 2:39:39.920]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[2:39:39.920 --> 2:39:43.920]  I want a new clip.
[2:39:43.920 --> 2:39:45.920]  Hell, an alligator clip would work.
[2:39:45.920 --> 2:39:47.920]  Anyway, sorry.
[2:39:47.920 --> 2:39:49.920]  I said I'd take your phone calls.
[2:39:49.920 --> 2:39:51.920]  And I'll host the fourth hour.
[2:39:51.920 --> 2:39:53.920]  I didn't get poor Burmese all lined up to host the show.
[2:39:53.920 --> 2:39:56.920]  They didn't take it away from me, but I mean, I do need to hit all this news,
[2:39:56.920 --> 2:39:58.920]  and I do need to take your calls.
[2:39:58.920 --> 2:40:02.920]  Burmese wants to do 30 minutes, he can, but I really need to take these calls.
[2:40:02.920 --> 2:40:06.920]  Because, you know, we're talking about all this super heavy stuff here today,
[2:40:06.920 --> 2:40:15.920]  and the question is, will we have time to get all these calls?
[2:40:15.920 --> 2:40:18.920]  And the answer is yes, we will, because we're going to start right now.
[2:40:18.920 --> 2:40:22.920]  I'm going to stop my preaching, and I'm going to go to, I guess,
[2:40:22.920 --> 2:40:28.920]  Daniel in Germany first, we need, is a new awakening.
[2:40:28.920 --> 2:40:32.920]  We've got Neil, we've got Moxie, we've got Gene, we've got Christian,
[2:40:32.920 --> 2:40:34.920]  we've got Dan, we've got Joseph, we've got Michael.
[2:40:34.920 --> 2:40:36.920]  We'll get to all these calls before I get out of here.
[2:40:36.920 --> 2:40:38.920]  Let's go ahead and go to Daniel in Deutschland.
[2:40:38.920 --> 2:40:40.920]  Daniel, you're on the air, welcome.
[2:40:40.920 --> 2:40:42.920]  Hello, how are you doing?
[2:40:42.920 --> 2:40:44.920]  I know you got a lot of calls.
[2:40:44.920 --> 2:40:45.920]  No, we love you, brother.
[2:40:45.920 --> 2:40:46.920]  Go ahead, we got plenty of time for you.
[2:40:46.920 --> 2:40:47.920]  Go ahead.
[2:40:47.920 --> 2:40:51.920]  Okay, you know, Will, the way I look at it is that we have to realize
[2:40:51.920 --> 2:40:56.920]  that last time there was a flood of water, and this time we're in a flood of lies.
[2:40:56.920 --> 2:41:00.920]  We're dealing with a flood of lies from the plant of lies.
[2:41:00.920 --> 2:41:02.920]  And so everything is a deception.
[2:41:02.920 --> 2:41:06.920]  You know, there's a mass delusion that's going on.
[2:41:06.920 --> 2:41:08.920]  And they've been lying to us a long time.
[2:41:08.920 --> 2:41:13.920]  So when it comes to the Bible, I don't think most people know what the game is really about.
[2:41:13.920 --> 2:41:20.920]  So the way I look at it from what I've been reading, it's about obedience to the creator, the maker.
[2:41:20.920 --> 2:41:22.920]  He wants to know who's going to listen, who's not.
[2:41:22.920 --> 2:41:27.920]  It starts from Adam and Eve not listening, and it goes on to every day.
[2:41:27.920 --> 2:41:29.920]  Who's listening, who's not.
[2:41:29.920 --> 2:41:31.920]  Who's obeying the commandments, who's not.
[2:41:31.920 --> 2:41:35.920]  And the game that we're playing is that we're trying to reach the first level of holiness.
[2:41:35.920 --> 2:41:40.920]  If you reach the first level of holiness, right, through obedience,
[2:41:40.920 --> 2:41:43.920]  then you will become a son of the creator yourself.
[2:41:43.920 --> 2:41:46.920]  You'll become a God yourself on the next level.
[2:41:46.920 --> 2:41:48.920]  You know, he is the Elohim of Elohim.
[2:41:48.920 --> 2:41:50.920]  He's the God of God.
[2:41:50.920 --> 2:41:51.920]  His sons are God.
[2:41:51.920 --> 2:41:55.920]  If you're adopted back into his family, you will become a God also.
[2:41:55.920 --> 2:41:56.920]  That's what we're playing for.
[2:41:56.920 --> 2:42:01.920]  And I don't think most people think they're just going to go up to heaven and float around on clouds.
[2:42:01.920 --> 2:42:04.920]  They have to be obedient because they have to be able to trust you.
[2:42:04.920 --> 2:42:10.920]  You know, he has one example, the Messiah, a son that listens to everything he says to do.
[2:42:10.920 --> 2:42:11.920]  Right?
[2:42:11.920 --> 2:42:12.920]  And he's real pleased with that son.
[2:42:12.920 --> 2:42:17.920]  There's another son that he has divorced from the family because he betrayed him.
[2:42:17.920 --> 2:42:20.920]  He thought he could do whatever he wants to do.
[2:42:20.920 --> 2:42:22.920]  It's right in front of people's face.
[2:42:22.920 --> 2:42:25.920]  It just comes down to obedience to the word.
[2:42:25.920 --> 2:42:30.920]  Well, there's no doubt God says we're made in the image of God and that Satan is jealous of that
[2:42:30.920 --> 2:42:32.920]  and wants to be God.
[2:42:32.920 --> 2:42:33.920]  You're absolutely right.
[2:42:33.920 --> 2:42:34.920]  I appreciate your call, Daniel.
[2:42:34.920 --> 2:42:35.920]  Thank you from Germany.
[2:42:35.920 --> 2:42:36.920]  Talk to that guy for an hour.
[2:42:36.920 --> 2:42:37.920]  All you guys are great.
[2:42:37.920 --> 2:42:41.920]  I'm going to shut up now and I'm going to go to your phone calls straight ahead.
[2:42:41.920 --> 2:42:46.920]  Up next, we're going to talk to Michael in Virginia, Moxie in Indiana, and so many others.
[2:42:46.920 --> 2:42:47.920]  Please stay with us.
[2:42:47.920 --> 2:42:50.920]  I'm going to try to jam five callers in the next 11-minute segment.
[2:42:50.920 --> 2:42:51.920]  We'll be right back.
[2:42:51.920 --> 2:42:56.920]  M4Wars.com
[2:43:21.920 --> 2:43:26.920]  M4Wars.com
[2:43:51.920 --> 2:43:56.920]  M4Wars.com
[2:44:21.920 --> 2:44:25.920]  And now we're just throwing it all away.
[2:44:25.920 --> 2:44:34.920]  And I see that they're all public, ENA, medically induced, scientifically induced, behavioral, psychologically controlled, tranty.
[2:44:34.920 --> 2:44:38.920]  And I know we're being fed into this globalist background and it's so incredibly sad.
[2:44:38.920 --> 2:44:49.920]  But this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating and collapsing and then coming back to life again.
[2:44:49.920 --> 2:44:57.920]  It's just the globalists are actively trying to steer and control this process of decimence and collapse to actually end the species as we know it.
[2:44:57.920 --> 2:45:00.920]  Ultimate bone broth is back and better than ever.
[2:45:00.920 --> 2:45:05.920]  And 20% off plus free shipping and double Patriot points for our new sale.
[2:45:05.920 --> 2:45:12.920]  After years of being off the shelves or bringing back one of the biggest fan favorite formulas ever, and it's now been reformulated as even stronger.
[2:45:12.920 --> 2:45:14.920]  It's Ultimate Bone Broth Plus.
[2:45:14.920 --> 2:45:23.920]  It's got concentrated high quality chicken broth protein, turmeric root that's so amazing, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder.
[2:45:23.920 --> 2:45:27.920]  Then it's got added magnesium and potassium for electrolytes.
[2:45:27.920 --> 2:45:33.920]  It's got real organic cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[2:45:33.920 --> 2:45:35.920]  It even tastes better than the last formula.
[2:45:35.920 --> 2:45:38.920]  And what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[2:45:38.920 --> 2:45:45.920]  Again, it has that cutting edge chicken broth protein, isolate powder for better flavor and solvability.
[2:45:45.920 --> 2:45:46.920]  You're going to love this.
[2:45:46.920 --> 2:45:50.920]  And what it does for your joints, what it does for your body, it does for your bones.
[2:45:50.920 --> 2:45:51.920]  It's simply amazing.
[2:45:51.920 --> 2:45:52.920]  And it helps funding InfoWare.
[2:45:52.920 --> 2:45:54.920]  This is really the best bone broth out there.
[2:45:54.920 --> 2:45:57.920]  So get yours at infowarstore.com today.
[2:45:57.920 --> 2:46:04.920]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[2:46:04.920 --> 2:46:10.920]  InfoWare has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[2:46:10.920 --> 2:46:17.920]  This InfoWare's life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase from the InfoWare store.
[2:46:17.920 --> 2:46:24.920]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[2:46:24.920 --> 2:46:29.920]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[2:46:29.920 --> 2:46:34.920]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[2:46:34.920 --> 2:46:40.920]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition,
[2:46:40.920 --> 2:46:43.920]  immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[2:46:43.920 --> 2:46:50.920]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[2:46:50.920 --> 2:46:57.920]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at infowarstore.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[2:46:57.920 --> 2:47:04.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:27.920 --> 2:47:34.920]  Well, we had Marjorie Taylor-Green on today in the second hour. It was an incredible interview.
[2:47:34.920 --> 2:47:37.920]  It will be archived soon at infowarstore.com if you missed it.
[2:47:37.920 --> 2:47:39.920]  And we streamed out the stations everywhere.
[2:47:39.920 --> 2:47:42.920]  We're going to your phone calls again right now.
[2:47:42.920 --> 2:47:45.920]  I have the transcript. They're getting the video right now. There's video of this.
[2:47:45.920 --> 2:47:47.920]  I'm told we'll air it next hour.
[2:47:47.920 --> 2:47:58.920]  I'm officially envious and jealous of Joe Rogan at this point, okay?
[2:47:58.920 --> 2:48:02.920]  Because I loved it when the White House and Hillary and Obama attacked me.
[2:48:02.920 --> 2:48:09.920]  That's when you know you're over the target because they hate doing that because it elevates you in the eyes of their minions.
[2:48:09.920 --> 2:48:19.920]  But White House urges Spotify to take further action on Joe Rogan.
[2:48:19.920 --> 2:48:24.920]  So you have the White House officially saying he should be taken off the air. I've got the transcript.
[2:48:24.920 --> 2:48:30.920]  The video's ready. Here, go ahead and roll it. Just go ahead and roll it right now.
[2:48:30.920 --> 2:48:38.920]  So our hope is that all major tech platforms and all major news sources, for that matter, be responsible and be vigilant to ensure the American people have access to accurate data.
[2:48:38.920 --> 2:48:42.920]  We love access to accurate information on something as significant as COVID-19.
[2:48:42.920 --> 2:48:55.920]  That certainly includes Spotify. So this disclaimer, it's a positive step, but we want every platform to continue doing more to call out misinformation while also uplifting accurate information.
[2:48:55.920 --> 2:49:02.920]  I mean, look at the facts, right? Our view is it's a good step. It's a positive step, but there's more that can be done.
[2:49:02.920 --> 2:49:08.920]  Look at the facts as she goes on. I got the transcript to attack Rogan and the rest of it and said, we got to stop this information.
[2:49:08.920 --> 2:49:14.920]  These are the biggest liars on the planet who want total surveillance of what you say and do because that's what censorship means.
[2:49:14.920 --> 2:49:21.920]  It doesn't just mean you're being censored. It means you're being watched to be censored. Let that sink in.
[2:49:21.920 --> 2:49:26.920]  Censorship is the byproduct of the surveillance. It is a symptom of the disease.
[2:49:26.920 --> 2:49:31.920]  All right, let's go to your phone calls. Let's go to Michael in Virginia. Michael, thanks for holding. Welcome.
[2:49:31.920 --> 2:49:33.920]  Michael, tell us what you think is going on here.
[2:49:33.920 --> 2:49:37.920]  Oh my God, Mr. Jones, this is my first time calling and speaking with you all these years trying to get through.
[2:49:37.920 --> 2:49:44.920]  First of all, I want to say, hallelujah to you and the production staff for all the hard work that you're doing and have done throughout these years.
[2:49:44.920 --> 2:49:47.920]  I want to say hallelujah for our crew as well. They're awesome.
[2:49:47.920 --> 2:49:58.920]  Yes, sir. And I also like to commend you for your introduction of the quantum mechanics, the quantum physics study of our reality.
[2:49:58.920 --> 2:50:04.920]  Amazing that you did that. And I want to commend you on that. In 2008, I took and studied your end game.
[2:50:04.920 --> 2:50:09.920]  It was a significant change in my life. I studied the brain. I studied quantum science.
[2:50:09.920 --> 2:50:19.920]  And for over 15, almost 20 years, 15, 16 years now, I've come to the conclusion and studied this and understand that we make a change,
[2:50:19.920 --> 2:50:25.920]  not through weapons. We make a change, not through arms and these types of things that the global is willing us to do.
[2:50:25.920 --> 2:50:30.920]  We make a change by using the power of Almighty God, which is the power given to us in our mind.
[2:50:30.920 --> 2:50:36.920]  Our Lord has given us the power to control and manipulate and control these evil demons.
[2:50:36.920 --> 2:50:45.920]  Now, first, second, my friend, Marjorie Green. Marjorie Green said you asked for more of Marjorie Green's character,
[2:50:45.920 --> 2:50:51.920]  which is a significance and a good step. Not her, but her character in Congress or in the Senate.
[2:50:51.920 --> 2:50:56.920]  We need more of her personality. And I'm going to this power of quantum science.
[2:50:56.920 --> 2:51:00.920]  I study and I'm 100% able to do things with this knowledge.
[2:51:00.920 --> 2:51:02.920]  Now, something about...
[2:51:02.920 --> 2:51:06.920]  Let me just say this. What you're saying is absolutely true. And the thing is Christ said is love.
[2:51:06.920 --> 2:51:09.920]  And then if you love people, you're going to work hard and build good things.
[2:51:09.920 --> 2:51:12.920]  If you love, you're going to be strong and beautiful.
[2:51:12.920 --> 2:51:17.920]  So love is the driving spirit. And then out of love flows everything good.
[2:51:17.920 --> 2:51:23.920]  If we do it for love and we do it for love of God, then love of everything that comes out of that, I totally agree with you.
[2:51:23.920 --> 2:51:30.920]  Something about Marjorie Green in the Congress, something about the Congress to change in Congress to that character is going to happen.
[2:51:30.920 --> 2:51:33.920]  This is the power of the quantum science that I study.
[2:51:33.920 --> 2:51:38.920]  And Mr. Harrison Smith and I have been speaking and he's aware of these things.
[2:51:38.920 --> 2:51:42.920]  And I want to again say thank you for the battles that you have fought.
[2:51:42.920 --> 2:51:49.920]  We are winning. Every battle is a step toward victory. Stay in the fight and never back down.
[2:51:49.920 --> 2:51:52.920]  Never give up. Never surrender, sir.
[2:51:52.920 --> 2:51:55.920]  Beautifully said. I want to say I love you, Michael. I appreciate your call.
[2:51:55.920 --> 2:51:58.920]  And he's absolutely right. That's why I talk about reset wars.
[2:51:58.920 --> 2:52:10.920]  Because look, I know this information innately, you know innately, but you've got to spend six, seven hours going through the fact the enemy knows it and is using the technology against you instead of you using it for yourself.
[2:52:10.920 --> 2:52:23.920]  So if everybody goes to resetwars.com and we're running a special right now of 50% off again at info wars, store.com has links to it, but the main site is resetwars.com.
[2:52:23.920 --> 2:52:27.920]  And that's what keeps us on air as well. So thank you all for the support.
[2:52:27.920 --> 2:52:30.920]  Okay, it has been on the longest now.
[2:52:30.920 --> 2:52:37.920]  That would be Christian in Michigan. Christian, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[2:52:37.920 --> 2:52:41.920]  Hi, Alex. Can you hear me? Yes, sir. Welcome.
[2:52:41.920 --> 2:52:48.920]  I don't have time to be starstruck. I'm celebrated my one year wedding anniversary recently.
[2:52:48.920 --> 2:52:55.920]  My wife was born and raised in Moscow. God forbid. And we've been through all the legal channels.
[2:52:55.920 --> 2:53:01.920]  We've paid our lawyer and the Department of Immigration roughly $10,000 so far.
[2:53:01.920 --> 2:53:12.920]  And we've received notification that because we won't take this sick vaccine that they intend to deny our application and deport her on March 7.
[2:53:12.920 --> 2:53:16.920]  And I can't imagine. Wow, we'll just go to Mexico and come across the border there.
[2:53:16.920 --> 2:53:19.920]  There'll be no problem because they don't make those folks take shots.
[2:53:19.920 --> 2:53:24.920]  Yeah, that's what I was saying there. I think that our lawyer, he's very pro-vaxx.
[2:53:24.920 --> 2:53:28.920]  I think that there are other. Yeah, I think your lawyer is pushing you around.
[2:53:28.920 --> 2:53:33.920]  I think he's a leftist. You need to get rid of him. Yeah, we've already basically done that.
[2:53:33.920 --> 2:53:39.920]  But we're basically up the creek. We've got four weeks left. I'll even leave my contact info with your crew.
[2:53:39.920 --> 2:53:45.920]  If there's anybody that wants to take it could be class action. This should be an open and shut case.
[2:53:45.920 --> 2:53:47.920]  What they're doing at the southern border versus what they're doing.
[2:53:47.920 --> 2:53:58.920]  You're married to her. It's your wife. But oh, you can't do that because you won't take the poison shot. You know, you should get in touch with some of the lawyer groups and organizations.
[2:53:58.920 --> 2:54:02.920]  In fact, who was that great group that is highly recommended we had on a few days ago?
[2:54:02.920 --> 2:54:07.920]  You should get in contact with them. Put them on hold. Put them in contact with those folks. Thank you so much, brother.
[2:54:07.920 --> 2:54:16.920]  All right, let's go ahead and take another call here. Let's go ahead and talk to Neil in North Carolina. Neil, welcome.
[2:54:16.920 --> 2:54:20.920]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call. Thank you.
[2:54:20.920 --> 2:54:33.920]  Listen, I'll be 65 this month and I was an avid Rush Limbaugh listener for 30 years. I talked to the man probably twice a year on his radio show.
[2:54:33.920 --> 2:54:42.920]  He read a couple of articles I wrote for American Thinker and when he passed away, I started watching you and I'm going to tell you something.
[2:54:42.920 --> 2:54:50.920]  There's a huge difference. Rush Limbaugh was superficial politics. He's a great guy, did a lot for the conservative movement.
[2:54:50.920 --> 2:54:59.920]  But you, Alex, you go deep. You go to the spiritual truth and you, it's a spiritual war.
[2:54:59.920 --> 2:55:07.920]  And one of the things that I think you understand more than anybody is Ephesians 6 verse 12.
[2:55:07.920 --> 2:55:19.920]  Our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.
[2:55:19.920 --> 2:55:27.920]  Our warfare is out of this world, but we are on this planet and you, my friend, are doing God's work.
[2:55:27.920 --> 2:55:37.920]  Well, brother, so are you and I love you and you're right. You know, Limbaugh, though he came before a lot of people, he got better as time went, so we can't look back and say, oh, he should have done a better job.
[2:55:37.920 --> 2:55:44.920]  Without him, the country would probably be lost. He wasn't perfect. He did some bad things, so have I, but he meant well and God judges the heart.
[2:55:44.920 --> 2:55:48.920]  And so, absolutely, we love Rush Limbaugh and we appreciate him.
[2:55:48.920 --> 2:55:58.920]  And, you know, I didn't fight over radio stations and try to, like, steal the throne from him when he died. You know, he went through a lot and we really appreciate Rush.
[2:55:58.920 --> 2:56:01.920]  Well, can I give you, can I give you a word of encouragement?
[2:56:01.920 --> 2:56:03.920]  Yes, sir.
[2:56:03.920 --> 2:56:13.920]  You know, Noah was asked to build an ark and you know, the Bible scholar said it was between 55 and 75 years that it took him to build that ark.
[2:56:13.920 --> 2:56:19.920]  And I know that in the past, recent past you've been talking about, you could just give it up and what's the point?
[2:56:19.920 --> 2:56:24.920]  Listen, you're building an ark, man. You're building the ark. Keep it up.
[2:56:24.920 --> 2:56:28.920]  I will, brother. And my problem is I wear my heart on my sleeve and I'm never going to give up.
[2:56:28.920 --> 2:56:37.920]  I just get angry and frustrated and work too much sometimes and just get nasty and I apologize. Hell, I can't give up. That's my problem is I can't even take a break.
[2:56:37.920 --> 2:56:47.920]  And so nobody's supposed to be like that. And so I get a little bit nasty and burnout and I've had a lot of, I don't feel sorry for myself, but man, a lot of nasty stuff behind the scenes.
[2:56:47.920 --> 2:56:53.920]  I mean, I just want people to pray for me and I don't say that selfishly. I think I'm doing good work, but I really need those prayers, folks.
[2:56:53.920 --> 2:57:00.920]  I would not be here without you. I would not be here without your support. There's no way we could do this without you.
[2:57:00.920 --> 2:57:08.920]  And, you know, I know it's God's plan and I signed on to this, but it's gotten pretty painful.
[2:57:08.920 --> 2:57:18.920]  And, you know, it's, I mean, folks, I'm literally hunted by the pedophiles. I mean, I have to, you know, they're just, they're like flying monkeys or something, man.
[2:57:18.920 --> 2:57:22.920]  I mean, they're just unbelievable and it's having to be around them. It's not going to be even scared of them.
[2:57:22.920 --> 2:57:35.920]  I just, they're so horrible and imagine being harassed and stalked by the pedophile ranks, the Wrenfields. And it's just, I just pray to God that I'll be renewed and not have to get so upset.
[2:57:35.920 --> 2:57:46.920]  It's just that I'm just so sad. They're so pathetic. They're like just the mere existence of them. It's about abomination.

[2:59:48.920 --> 2:59:57.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:59:57.920 --> 3:00:12.920]  It's always nice when a plan comes together.
[3:00:12.920 --> 3:00:28.920]  Margie Taylor Greene was on a few hours ago, and enemies of humanity are flipping out. They believe they dictate reality, but as they are now discovering, they do not.
[3:00:28.920 --> 3:00:35.920]  And your murder of our innocent children will be repaid one trillion fold.
[3:00:35.920 --> 3:00:51.920]  You will be dumped into a black hole for all of eternity with your own energy, consuming yourselves forever by your choice, not ours.
[3:00:51.920 --> 3:01:10.920]  Alex Jones and Margie Taylor Greene defend Fauci being compared to Nazi Dr. Joseph Mengele.
[3:01:10.920 --> 3:01:20.920]  I'm not happy that I'm in some article. I'm happy they took the bait. I'll explain it tomorrow, but it's always good to expose these people.
[3:01:20.920 --> 3:01:26.920]  Let's go ahead and go to your phone calls. Who's holding the longest here? Is it Joseph? Is it Gene? Is it Moxie? It's Moxie.
[3:01:26.920 --> 3:01:34.920]  And then Gene and Joseph and Dan. Moxie, you're on the air from Indiana. You got a lot of Moxie holding. We appreciate you. Go ahead.
[3:01:34.920 --> 3:01:45.920]  I got a message for the truckers throughout the world and the United States. So listen up. God is with you. It's always been you.
[3:01:45.920 --> 3:01:57.920]  You have been chosen. No one else is coming to save us. God always wins. God chooses to humble in the meek. It's not going to be the politician.
[3:01:57.920 --> 3:02:09.920]  And it sure as hell isn't going to be Trump. Go in God's feet and have faith and he will provide a way. He will open doors.
[3:02:09.920 --> 3:02:19.920]  Beautifully said. I mean, humanity is rising peacefully to resist this and we can't not show up in D.C. or Ottawa because it could be provocateurs.
[3:02:19.920 --> 3:02:29.920]  We have to expose the provocateurs. We have to do the right thing and stand up. Anything else, Moxie? She's hung up.
[3:02:29.920 --> 3:02:37.920]  All right. Well, thank you, Moxie, for holding to say that. It was very, very true. All right. Next up is Gene in Georgia. You're on the air. Gene, welcome.
[3:02:37.920 --> 3:02:47.920]  Brother Alex. Welcome, sir. Man. You want to talk about Operation Fishbowl? Go ahead. Tell us about it. Yeah. Let me tell you about Operation Fishbowl.
[3:02:47.920 --> 3:02:57.920]  It's been going on since the days of, you know, when they built the Tower of Bible, when Hillary Clinton said it, we got to break that glass ceiling.
[3:02:57.920 --> 3:03:06.920]  These evil people trying to get back to heaven. They've already been cast to the earth. You're among this, brother Alex. You know that.
[3:03:06.920 --> 3:03:19.920]  Let me tell you about truth. It's about the lambs. It's about the children. It's what Jesus said. Like brother Owen and Harrison, he's been out with microphones.
[3:03:19.920 --> 3:03:26.920]  He's been out speaking against Planned Parenthood. If we can't take care of the children, what good are we?
[3:03:26.920 --> 3:03:33.920]  Well, that's right. God judges us by how we treat the children. Christ said, if you don't defend the children, you would be better for you to kill yourself.
[3:03:33.920 --> 3:03:42.920]  Exactly. Bang the stone around your neck and be tossed in the sea. But I got to tell you, I'm going to puff you up a little bit about the things that you are doing.
[3:03:42.920 --> 3:03:50.920]  You were born for this generation. Your mind's like a computer. God give you that gift. I don't see how you sleep at night.
[3:03:50.920 --> 3:03:57.920]  But let me tell you something, brother Alex. You keep going because you ain't going nowhere. There is evil in this world.
[3:03:57.920 --> 3:04:04.920]  God's lifting the veil and he's showing it and you're telling people about it. That's what matters.
[3:04:04.920 --> 3:04:20.920]  People got to start standing up, praying to God, praying to our Father in heaven. You're teaching. You're not a preacher. You're just a man that God has sent you like John the Baptist crying in the wilderness.
[3:04:20.920 --> 3:04:28.920]  That's all you're doing. And I just want to tell the people out there to keep defunding you because you're not going nowhere.
[3:04:28.920 --> 3:04:30.920]  God's already got plans for you.
[3:04:30.920 --> 3:04:34.920]  Brother, I love you and I appreciate you. And thank you so much for calling.
[3:04:34.920 --> 3:04:41.920]  All right. Dan and Joseph, your calls are straight ahead on the other side.
[3:04:41.920 --> 3:04:47.920]  And then Jason Burma's great researcher always groundbreaking informative stuff is coming up in 15 minutes.
[3:04:47.920 --> 3:04:52.920]  Final segment with Potbelly Goblin straight ahead. Stay with us.
[3:05:17.920 --> 3:05:22.920]  It takes you to these folks. They supply the board for all everybody with their systems as well. They're amazing folks.
[3:05:22.920 --> 3:05:29.920]  And you get a free phone of $600 to $50 value. Absolutely free at m4warsphone.com.
[3:05:29.920 --> 3:05:34.920]  Smartphones are always tracking everything you do. These aren't. And the calls are free when folks call you.
[3:05:34.920 --> 3:05:41.920]  You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes, $150 minutes. So the calls you are free works like a regular cell phone.
[3:05:41.920 --> 3:05:47.920]  Tractor traced. And I keep on my car. I've given it to my parents as gifts way out the middle of nowhere where regular phones don't work.
[3:05:47.920 --> 3:06:13.920]  m4warsphone.com or 941-955-1029-4195-1020 and ask the Alex Jones special.
[3:06:13.920 --> 3:06:18.920]  You are receiving this transmission. You are the resistance.
[3:06:18.920 --> 3:06:25.920]  Live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[3:06:25.920 --> 3:06:33.920]  All right, two final callers Dan and Joseph. And then Jason Burma takes over Dan in New York. Thank you for calling. Go ahead.
[3:06:33.920 --> 3:06:46.920]  Yes, Alex. I just wanted to say that, I mean, over the past two years of them completely going for broke, you have complete and utter resistance and people just completely denying.
[3:06:46.920 --> 3:06:57.920]  I think there's a lot of positivity going on right now. And you even have, and you just said the historic, I think it's as historic as Hillary Clinton saying your name is them going after Rogan and free speech in general.
[3:06:57.920 --> 3:07:04.920]  They are, they are freaking out at the top levels. I think it's something to celebrate and continue to push forward.
[3:07:04.920 --> 3:07:12.920]  And that's the thing. If they, because Joe's not perfect, I'm not perfect. If they hadn't harassed Joe, I know the behind the scenes stuff and mess with him at YouTube and other platforms.
[3:07:12.920 --> 3:07:22.920]  He wouldn't have done this. He was just trying to live his life and get along. But like, he will fight back. And so the more they do this, they just, that's what bullies don't get.
[3:07:22.920 --> 3:07:28.920]  I can fight pretty good if I need to. I'm not the toughest guy around. I don't just walk into a place and pick the biggest guy I can and start a fight.
[3:07:28.920 --> 3:07:41.920]  But that's what they do because if you're Fauci or Saki or David Rockefeller, they just, or Bill Gates, they are just jerks, man. They are evil.
[3:07:41.920 --> 3:07:52.920]  Of course. Yeah, no. And like you said, Joe's not someone to be pushed around and he just wants to go about and do his podcast as well as you. And then people want to hear that. People want to hear alternative views.
[3:07:52.920 --> 3:08:05.920]  And they, once they want to shut you out of that, people are like, what's going on here with people on the left and on the right as well. Or like, what's going on with all this, especially with people swapping this vaccine and just like walking around like zombies.
[3:08:05.920 --> 3:08:08.920]  People are like, what's going on? They want to, they want to know.
[3:08:08.920 --> 3:08:15.920]  Well, it's all going to work out in God's plan, but you're absolutely right. And that's why people sharing the articles, the videos, you get persecuted for doing it.
[3:08:15.920 --> 3:08:19.920]  But it wakes so many people up. So the articles, the videos, you are the core people.
[3:08:19.920 --> 3:08:29.920]  And just as important as I am that share not just the material and info wars or free world news.tv or may not video, but all the great stuff that's out there, all the great truth.
[3:08:29.920 --> 3:08:32.920]  It's up to you. We really appreciate you and thank you for the call.
[3:08:32.920 --> 3:08:40.920]  All right, Joseph in Canada. Wow. So much happening there on the trucker convoy. Give us the latest developments. We're like what day five now in Ottawa.
[3:08:40.920 --> 3:08:43.920]  Hello. Can you hear me?
[3:08:43.920 --> 3:08:44.920]  Yes, sir. Welcome.
[3:08:44.920 --> 3:08:47.920]  Oh, hi, Alex. Thank you for taking my call.
[3:08:47.920 --> 3:08:48.920]  Thank you.
[3:08:48.920 --> 3:08:51.920]  So what's going on with the convoy? You're up in Canada.
[3:08:51.920 --> 3:09:02.920]  Yeah, well, it's absolutely crazy. I actually went to a rally on Saturday here in Winnipeg and there's just so much energy. It's just like an unbelievable amount of vehicles.
[3:09:02.920 --> 3:09:10.920]  And I'm watching the videos of what's going on in Ottawa and at the borders and everything. And this just looks absolutely revolutionary.
[3:09:10.920 --> 3:09:21.920]  I was hearing as much as like 500,000 people or something in Ottawa and per capita, that's just things like Canada, like a tenth of the population of the U.S.
[3:09:21.920 --> 3:09:24.920]  So it's like this is absolutely insane.
[3:09:24.920 --> 3:09:25.920]  And it brings.
[3:09:25.920 --> 3:09:28.920]  Yeah, so that's the equivalent of 5 million people marching in the U.S.
[3:09:28.920 --> 3:09:35.920]  I think 500,000 is a very conservative number because for days the roads are blocked. People can't even get in there.
[3:09:35.920 --> 3:09:44.920]  Oh, yeah. But my question, my concern here is, it looks like we're winning and Omicron's just like a joke and the COVID narrative is falling apart.
[3:09:44.920 --> 3:09:54.920]  I'm concerned about the globalist next move. And I know, I know you're somewhat provocative tours, but I'm wondering if they're going to maybe release another virus or something nastier than COVID.
[3:09:54.920 --> 3:09:57.920]  I just want to hear your thoughts on that.
[3:09:57.920 --> 3:09:59.920]  Well, I think you nailed it, Joseph.
[3:09:59.920 --> 3:10:08.920]  Bill Gates has said, oh, terrorists are about to release a new one. And he's the one that cooked it up at Wuhan. He's the one that released it with Fauci.
[3:10:08.920 --> 3:10:11.920]  And so they're the main suspect of any of that happens.
[3:10:11.920 --> 3:10:22.920]  But the big thing being hyped by Klaus Schwab and others is a controlled power outage, a cyber attack they blame on some nebulous group or a patriot group to just turn the power off.
[3:10:22.920 --> 3:10:30.920]  And people don't ask, oh, who's doing this? Same folks open the borders. Same folks killed the dollar. Same folks did drag queen story time.
[3:10:30.920 --> 3:10:37.920]  Same folks attacked everybody. This is their siege against us to get us to politically forget how they're bad.
[3:10:37.920 --> 3:10:43.920]  Forget how they're a fraud because they're failing with 279 days in the midterms of the U.S.
[3:10:43.920 --> 3:10:53.920]  With populist parties rising in Europe and Canada and Australia, they're going to need something to reset everything.
[3:10:53.920 --> 3:11:02.920]  And Schwab has been telegraphing to his criminal syndicate members and cult members, his believers, as he calls them, to the cabinet and see controls that we will still defeat them.
[3:11:02.920 --> 3:11:16.920]  Cyber attack shut things down many times worse than COVID. Ah, yeah, cyber. So that's what we got to worry about. The enemy psychotic criminals love to tell what they're going to do.
[3:11:16.920 --> 3:11:24.920]  And he is saying, I'm going to blow your power systems out. I'm going to starve you to death. I'm going to kill you because I am your God.
[3:11:24.920 --> 3:11:32.920]  I wonder when they're going to do it. You know, I thought maybe it would happen this winter, but like we're in February now.
[3:11:32.920 --> 3:11:39.920]  Brother, I mean, that's the thick of winter around here. So we'll see what happens. But any day now, I hope it doesn't happen.
[3:11:39.920 --> 3:11:50.920]  But I mean, he's been like, the cyber attack is the issue. You will think of COVID is fun. So I mean, he loves to tell you what he's going to do.
[3:11:50.920 --> 3:11:58.920]  God bless you. I appreciate your call. All right, Jason Bermas is about to take over. Wow, he'll have a lot to say the war room.
[3:11:58.920 --> 3:12:05.920]  It's coming up in about 50 minutes from now with Owen Schreuer. But look at these articles are army dot mill.
[3:12:05.920 --> 3:12:11.920]  Department of the army to initiate separation of COVID-19 vaccination order refusers.
[3:12:11.920 --> 3:12:20.920]  So now the beginning of separating them and then locking them up, just like Democrat Congress people have called for and the bills are introduced.
[3:12:20.920 --> 3:12:26.920]  Oh, but it's all the triple facts of the most sick. It doesn't protect you. Like they said, that's a lie.
[3:12:26.920 --> 3:12:32.920]  That's been disproven. The UK government had to pull ads saying 90% of hospitalized didn't take the shot.
[3:12:32.920 --> 3:12:42.920]  No, it was actually 87% injected were in the hospital. It doesn't protect you. It's not a vaccine. It's a poison. That's coming out.
[3:12:42.920 --> 3:12:55.920]  They don't know what to do. And then even Reuters runs a story about ivermectin antiviral effect in a major Japanese government study and others that it is an incredible antiviral, including COVID-19.
[3:12:55.920 --> 3:13:05.920]  And then John Hopkins study lockdowns did not reduce COVID deaths but had devastated. It's a quote effects on society.
[3:13:05.920 --> 3:13:11.920]  Impose enormous economic and social costs. That was the plan. Great reset.
[3:13:11.920 --> 3:13:18.920]  US National Debt Skyrock is a 30 trillion three years earlier than expected after borrowing surge during pandemic.
[3:13:18.920 --> 3:13:22.920]  You're being bankrupt. You're being put into a position of control.
[3:13:22.920 --> 3:13:28.920]  Here's the actual John Hopkins report. Extremely important. We'll be covering this more on my show tomorrow.
[3:13:28.920 --> 3:13:32.920]  Owen's covering it coming up today on the war room.
[3:13:32.920 --> 3:13:39.920]  Now they have national polls. As you know, they skew 15 points on average in the US and Canada for pro globalist policies.
[3:13:39.920 --> 3:13:49.920]  But now even with that, the vast majority of Canadians support ending the lockdowns, the forced injections and the tyranny because they saw other stand up and didn't feel alone.
[3:13:49.920 --> 3:13:56.920]  Majority of Canadians now want COVID rules to end after trucker revolt. Big story on info wars.com.
[3:13:56.920 --> 3:14:01.920]  Only way it gets out is you sharing it. Illinois Democrat calls for quarantine to observe those refusing vaccines.
[3:14:01.920 --> 3:14:04.920]  Told you about that. There's the article.
[3:14:04.920 --> 3:14:10.920]  Austria embraces the number two guy in the government, the opposition leader, says Austria embraces communism.
[3:14:10.920 --> 3:14:19.920]  Freedom Party condemns vaccine. Chinese social model says it's medical communism bingo bingo bingo.
[3:14:19.920 --> 3:14:25.920]  Toddler refuses refused heart surgery in three separate countries for parents being unjabbed.
[3:14:25.920 --> 3:14:32.920]  West Australia threatens $50,000 fine and jail time for people who are offensive to workers checking vax cards.
[3:14:32.920 --> 3:14:43.920]  Next, it'll be life in prison or death. Oh, it's they're just up in the size of the stick. Unvax parents in Western Australia banned from visiting children in the hospital so they can have their way with them.
[3:14:43.920 --> 3:14:49.920]  They want to separate children from their parents. That's the pedophile. Holy grail.
[3:14:49.920 --> 3:14:54.920]  We're going to go to break. Jason Burmes is going to take over three big announcements.
[3:14:54.920 --> 3:15:02.920]  The first time in four years, because they want to just support our broadcast and support you, ready to ship 25% off.

[3:15:20.920 --> 3:15:26.920]  Next three, the deep earth crystal iodine that's so good for your immune system, your stamina, everything.
[3:15:26.920 --> 3:15:39.920]  Look into the iodine fluoride conspiracy. It's 50% off back in stock and resetwars.com for the first time because they tried to censor it and block it.

[3:16:20.920 --> 3:16:29.920]  And you know, I'm telling you, the vitamin D gummies, this is a great thing for your kids. They're going to love it. They're going to love the taste of the gummies. It's healthy.
[3:16:29.920 --> 3:16:37.920]  So that's just a great thing for kids. I mean, we could just do marketing campaigns. I think for kids that'd be great. The calcium good for them, the vitamin D.
[3:16:37.920 --> 3:16:51.920]  So that's at infowarstore.com. And again, it's your support there that keeps us on the air. So supplements, the shirts, the air filters, the water filters, the emergency food supplies, the emergency supplies at infowarstore.com.

[3:17:11.920 --> 3:17:18.920]  It's our new faster absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[3:17:18.920 --> 3:17:29.920]  Formulated to improve upon our best selling product, Knockout, with down and out, now the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[3:17:29.920 --> 3:17:34.920]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[3:17:34.920 --> 3:17:51.920]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower, which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees, who used it for its relaxing qualities. Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will be down and out.
[3:17:51.920 --> 3:18:16.920]  Selling out now at infowarstore.com.

[3:18:26.920 --> 3:18:32.920]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop their agenda, but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[3:18:32.920 --> 3:18:39.920]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food. We've got the best food, ready to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com.

[3:19:15.920 --> 3:19:26.920]  It really, really works. It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up. And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions.
[3:19:26.920 --> 3:19:35.920]  They also work quite well, but just aren't as strong. This is like a very fine wine. In fact, each batch is different. Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[3:19:35.920 --> 3:19:40.920]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong? That's just how it is. It's how it works.
[3:19:40.920 --> 3:19:56.920]  So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like super strong. But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[3:19:56.920 --> 3:20:11.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:11.920 --> 3:20:38.920]  Hey everybody, Jason Bermas here sitting in for the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show and we've got so much important information to go over in the next 40 minutes or so. Let's start with the announcement that your toddler, your six month old up till five is now going to be injected with three shots of hate and lies.
[3:20:38.920 --> 3:20:48.920]  That is the new promotion. That's what I had to watch. This ghoul, this guy right here couldn't be faker. We're going to play the clip. Okay.
[3:20:48.920 --> 3:21:03.920]  With a Stanford, I don't even want to call him a doctor. I don't want to call him a medical professional. He is a propagandist and a black propagandist at that.
[3:21:03.920 --> 3:21:12.920]  And if you paid attention to the last time that I did the fourth hour, the Pfizer CEO already announced you'll have shop for by March.
[3:21:12.920 --> 3:21:20.920]  And what do they do? They went along with the lies, the hate, the Bernaysian talking points of safe and effective.
[3:21:20.920 --> 3:21:33.920]  And now this smiling, fake voiced, nothing head. I mean, how do you live with yourself? You put on a suit, you smile, you're talking to fake voice. Hey everybody.
[3:21:33.920 --> 3:21:46.920]  How do you live with yourself? When you're talking about injecting infants and toddlers and acting like you're doing this as part of protecting people.
[3:21:46.920 --> 3:21:54.920]  It made me want to vomit in my mouth. Okay. And I'm not sure how much of that we're actually going to be able to play because it is so over the top.
[3:21:54.920 --> 3:22:04.920]  In that clip, they take a woman and they shame her, okay, for not being vaccinated as she's having a baby.
[3:22:04.920 --> 3:22:10.920]  She doesn't even know that she's tested positive for COVID because she has no symptoms. They take her baby away.
[3:22:10.920 --> 3:22:21.920]  They isolate her from her baby. And now it's, oh, now I am going to get the vaccine after I tested positive for COVID, after I had no symptoms, after I was isolated from my child.
[3:22:21.920 --> 3:22:26.920]  And then I have to decide whether I want to pump this stuff into my infant. Okay.
[3:22:26.920 --> 3:22:41.920]  Now, on the contrary to that, we are going to play Alex Berenson, finally having his come to God moment, going on Tucker Carlson last week and saying nobody should be taking any of the mRNA shots.
[3:22:41.920 --> 3:22:49.920]  You know who told you that from the beginning? This guy. This guy, Alex Jones, infowars.com. Took you a little too long, Alex.
[3:22:49.920 --> 3:22:56.920]  But when you watch him on Tucker, you can hear the crackling in his voice. Okay.
[3:22:56.920 --> 3:23:08.920]  So meanwhile, I want you to think about this reality right now. ABC primetime news is telling you to shoot your toddler up three times.
[3:23:08.920 --> 3:23:18.920]  Once, two weeks later, eight weeks after that. And don't think that shots four and five that are coming won't be a part of that schedule if they have their way.
[3:23:18.920 --> 3:23:28.920]  And they act like they're so concerned. Meanwhile, Berenson is telling everybody under no circumstance take any more of these shots about time.
[3:23:28.920 --> 3:23:36.920]  About time. We're also going to be talking about how apparently, constitutions no longer matter in this country.
[3:23:36.920 --> 3:23:51.920]  There have been two huge massive state constitutional decisions that the media then completely spins out of control and acts like they don't have standing, one of which happened last week.
[3:23:51.920 --> 3:23:59.920]  New York State mask mandate temporarily back in place after judge grants motion to state. No, that's not true. None of that is true.
[3:23:59.920 --> 3:24:12.920]  All right, this is the lie of CNN. What actually happened and we're going to show you the document is that a Long Island judge in Nassau County heard the case finally and ruled correctly.
[3:24:12.920 --> 3:24:21.920]  I was as shocked as anybody else. I was literally as shocked as anybody else because I couldn't believe we're going to read it for you right now because it is so important.
[3:24:21.920 --> 3:24:29.920]  Okay, now the lawyers brought this up and these were all the mask mandates in New York school or otherwise.
[3:24:29.920 --> 3:24:39.920]  And you know when Alex talks about these things that are happening to children at bare minimum, if you're not fighting for your kids, not to be masked up and tortured every day.
[3:24:39.920 --> 3:24:47.920]  What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you? Okay, I moved across the country.
[3:24:47.920 --> 3:24:52.920]  I took my two nieces with me. I just picked up my niece at school when I go to pick up my niece at school.
[3:24:52.920 --> 3:25:04.920]  One of the most joyous things that a normal person likes is a bunch of smiling faces coming out the door and playing with one another, having a good time with that childlike innocence.
[3:25:04.920 --> 3:25:09.920]  Now they're stealing that. They want three shots of hate and lies in your infant.
[3:25:09.920 --> 3:25:20.920]  So I'm going to highlight this right here. It says it's a law and not a permissively enacted rule, null and void as a matter of law, improperly enacted, constitutionally impermissible,
[3:25:20.920 --> 3:25:25.920]  violated of their constitutional rights, and unenforceable.
[3:25:25.920 --> 3:25:37.920]  Let me repeat that. The mask mandate is unenforceable and this judge on every single count ordered and a judged, ordered and a judged, ordered and a judge.
[3:25:37.920 --> 3:25:41.920]  What does that actually mean? Because the media won't tell you.
[3:25:41.920 --> 3:25:44.920]  Okay, let me tell you how it's supposed to work.
[3:25:44.920 --> 3:25:54.920]  Okay, as stated previously, there can be no doubt that every person in the state wishes, wants and prays that this era of COVID ends soon and they will surely do their part to see that it is accomplished.
[3:25:54.920 --> 3:25:56.920]  That's Johnny Nonsense.
[3:25:56.920 --> 3:26:10.920]  There is a sect of individuals that lick the boots and bend the knee to the predator class so that they can be social climbers as well and get a little bit of power and think they're in control.
[3:26:10.920 --> 3:26:12.920]  Okay?
[3:26:12.920 --> 3:26:26.920]  However, enacting any laws to this end is entrusted solely to the state legislator while the intentioners of Commissioner Bassett and Governor Hochelt appear to be well aimed squarely at doing what they believe is right to protect the citizens of New York.
[3:26:26.920 --> 3:26:37.920]  They must take their case to the state legislator, which they have not done and will continue not to do because now there's a new word called appeal.
[3:26:37.920 --> 3:26:46.920]  State constitutions, when they're upheld by judges in constitutional rulings, appeal. We appeal.
[3:26:46.920 --> 3:27:06.920]  Should the state legislator, representative of and voted into office by the citizens of New York after publicly informed debate, decide to enact laws requiring face coverings in schools and other public places, then the commissioner would likely be well grounded in properly promulgated and enacted rules to supplement such laws.
[3:27:06.920 --> 3:27:24.920]  But that never happened. So it got shot down and they had form letters ready at 10 p.m. acting like they were going to be localized. They had them ready saying, we don't care. Your kid's going to be tortured in our institution tomorrow.
[3:27:24.920 --> 3:27:31.920]  Let me show you something else. Now they're huge. State Supreme Court decision that you're not hearing about.
[3:27:31.920 --> 3:27:47.920]  Court throws Pennsylvania's mail-in voting law into doubt. And this is the AP doing a hatchet job, just like CNN just did, letting you know that all of the mail-in ballots in the state of Pennsylvania were completely unconstitutional.
[3:27:47.920 --> 3:27:56.920]  Remember that Time Magazine article where they fortified the election? Were they bragged about it? They said that they went to the edge of the law. No, they broke the law.
[3:27:56.920 --> 3:28:10.920]  Every single one. Let me repeat this. And this isn't going to get trumped into office. And I'm not part of the fantasy team. And I warn people that eventually it would come out that all of these things actually did happen and they were unconstitutional.
[3:28:10.920 --> 3:28:15.920]  And there was collusion. And they did steal this thing. Doesn't mean they're going to re-institute the guy.
[3:28:15.920 --> 3:28:29.920]  So I want to repeat that. The state constitution was upheld. And they said none of these ballots mattered at all. Appeal. We appeal. That's what we do now.
[3:28:29.920 --> 3:28:36.920]  So on the flip side of this, we got plenty of clips. And you heard Alex talking about Prince Andrew and Eugenics?
[3:28:36.920 --> 3:28:54.920]  Yeah, we're going to play you a clip from 1984 where he basically calls all of humanity a plague, except for him and his cronies. Infowars.com, SaveInfoWars.com and InfowarsStore.com to support the broadcast right now. And Alex Jones.
[3:29:07.920 --> 3:29:22.920]  This Infowars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase from the Infowars store. The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[3:29:22.920 --> 3:29:41.920]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown. As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[3:29:41.920 --> 3:29:55.920]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America. So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at InfowarsStore.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie.

[3:33:14.920 --> 3:33:29.920]  So far back, I am Jason Burma, sitting in the fourth hour for Alex Jones. We are going to go to this clip. Now this is Geo Bonitas at ABC News Live Prime. You know how many views this video had? 21,000.
[3:33:29.920 --> 3:33:49.920]  It's pathetic. It's pathetic. Barely anybody listens to these people. But unfortunately, it's spread across the entirety of the mainstream, whether it's ABC, CBS, NBC, and yes, Fox, even though we're going to show you a Fox clip after this portraying a much harsher reality.
[3:33:49.920 --> 3:34:00.920]  And finally, Alex Baranson, when you're not taking potshots at Robert Malone, right? You're finally coming around. This guy is as fake as it gets. Let's start the clip.
[3:34:00.920 --> 3:34:17.920]  There was some breaking news, possible relief for parents across the country. Pfizer has requested emergency youth authorization from the FDA for their extra low dose child vaccine, saying it will protect kids as young as six months old. Now this could bring families one step closer to near normalcy.
[3:34:17.920 --> 3:34:31.920]  See, right now, near normalcy. Hey, a woman with her baby in a window with a mask on. Are you watching? And this goes on for eight, nine minutes. I can't play the whole thing, especially going over it. We've got other important stuff to play.
[3:34:31.920 --> 3:34:45.920]  But just the framing of this makes me nauseous. 19 million children under five are still not eligible to get vaccinated. Pfizer submitted data for two doses, but says eventually young children will likely need three shots.
[3:34:45.920 --> 3:34:59.920]  The first two weeks given the first two shots given three weeks apart, the third coming in at least eight weeks after that. Now recent and it's not just three. They will keep going and going and going and going.
[3:34:59.920 --> 3:35:10.920]  Data shows that just two doses are safe, but not extremely effective. Remember when two doses were safe and effective for everybody? But now they're they're extremely safe.
[3:35:10.920 --> 3:35:23.920]  OK, but not very extremely effective. They're not extremely effective anymore. See, I mean, wow. Wow. Read to you by an automaton puppet, a parent.
[3:35:23.920 --> 3:35:36.920]  The FDA's advisory committee will meet this month to review Pfizer's application and young children could get their first shots before March. Last week, more than 808,000 children tested positive for COVID-19.
[3:35:36.920 --> 3:35:51.920]  Notice they ramp up the fear numbers. It's positive tests. It's positive tests. I want to skip over a little bit because, again, it just makes me so nauseous. Here's this woman. She's injecting all of her kids six months to four years, three doses, three doses.
[3:35:51.920 --> 3:36:06.920]  I want to I want to get to this woman, this poor woman right here after this, you know, Pfizer, Pfizer lackey that she tests positive. This this poor woman has no symptoms, isn't sick. They're in biomedical outfits.
[3:36:06.920 --> 3:36:11.920]  Apparently, apparently all these people that have been exposed should have natural immunity after getting infected. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.
[3:36:11.920 --> 3:36:17.920]  Have have rolled their sleep up. How many times? Not enough. Not enough. Let's separate you from your babies.
[3:36:17.920 --> 3:36:26.920]  There will be more coming in the future. At DHR Health in McAllen, Samantha Reina, who was unvaccinated, testing positive while she was in labor.
[3:36:26.920 --> 3:36:39.920]  And totally fine. Think about that. She tested positive while in labor. The baby is inside her. It is a part of her life force. But you know what they're going to do? They'll separate you. Oh, I didn't even know I had it.
[3:36:39.920 --> 3:36:45.920]  They told me that I was positive and I didn't know. Were you shocked? Yeah, I was. I was actually completely shocked.
[3:36:45.920 --> 3:36:56.920]  Samantha quarantined away from her newborn to protect him until they could be reunited after her release from the hospital. She now wants to get vaccinated and is considering the shot for her son, too.
[3:36:56.920 --> 3:37:06.920]  So again, they tell her she got it. She's not even that sick. The pressure is because she's separated from her child. That's the reality.
[3:37:06.920 --> 3:37:16.920]  So, you know, I'm going to skip over all this where she now tells you the most, you know, let's play it. Because they're heavily vaccinated in this area, but now there's a surge, another buzzword.
[3:37:16.920 --> 3:37:19.920]  So that's how safe and effective these things have been.
[3:37:19.920 --> 3:37:30.920]  Now, Medea, you are still there in Texas where you visited that overwhelmed hospital. The surge there is also connected to underlying health conditions.
[3:37:30.920 --> 3:37:37.920]  That's exactly right, Geo. A lot of what they're dealing with here is the good news, at least, is that they have high vaccination rates, right?
[3:37:37.920 --> 3:37:49.920]  So especially among the elderly that plays into it. However, a lot of what they're dealing with isn't just the coronavirus. It's the comorbidities, things like diabetes, hypertension, obesity as well.
[3:37:49.920 --> 3:38:02.920]  So don't let me just stop you. All those things were issues way before. They never talked about them. But now, because they're in a highly vaccinated area, in other words, I'm going to translate this for you, the majority of the people in there have taken the shots.
[3:38:02.920 --> 3:38:10.920]  They've taken the hate and lies. Doesn't stop this smiling ghoul, this guy right here. Okay, look at all these kids, man.
[3:38:10.920 --> 3:38:23.920]  In mass, this guy pushing three shots on your children, this, this Stanford ghoul for being here. An important night to really get all of this information out to parents here.
[3:38:23.920 --> 3:38:33.920]  Geo, thank you for having me. It absolutely is. I cannot tell you how many parents, even teenagers, caretakers, babysitters, pediatricians who have been asking, where is this vaccine?
[3:38:33.920 --> 3:38:42.920]  We know that even though kids are less likely to get severely ill or hospitalized, they absolutely still can get severely ill, pass on COVID to others, get long COVID and more.
[3:38:42.920 --> 3:38:44.920]  So it's important we protect them.
[3:38:44.920 --> 3:38:51.920]  Yeah. Again, it didn't protect the general populace. These are hate and lie shots. This guy just made up that so many people are in fear.
[3:38:51.920 --> 3:39:03.920]  The ones that are in fear are in fear because of your propagated lies, your hate and lies, your defense department, Cy Warfare. That's what it is. It's Cy Warfare.
[3:39:03.920 --> 3:39:13.920]  DoD style, baby. All right, with your DARPA mRNA shots, Moderna and Pfizer. So we got a few minutes. I can't stand that guy.
[3:39:13.920 --> 3:39:22.920]  Here's Berenson, finally, finally having that moment where his voice quivers and he says nobody should take these shots.
[3:39:22.920 --> 3:39:32.920]  We're at a very dangerous moment, Tucker, and I'm not exaggerating. I think this is probably the most important appearance I've had with you in the last two years.
[3:39:32.920 --> 3:39:43.920]  It is completely clear now that the vaccines don't really work at all against Omicron in these highly vaccinated and highly boosted countries.
[3:39:43.920 --> 3:39:50.920]  Rates of infection are incredibly high and rates of serious disease and death are also rising.
[3:39:50.920 --> 3:39:56.920]  The Israelis are predicting that they're going to have more serious cases than they ever had at the peak last year.
[3:39:56.920 --> 3:40:03.920]  And the idea that we would solve this with another booster is just off the charts insane.
[3:40:03.920 --> 3:40:08.920]  I have not said this to you before because I'm pretty careful and I'm pretty careful with the data.
[3:40:08.920 --> 3:40:13.920]  But these vaccines, these mRNA vaccines, the mRNA COVID vaccines need to be withdrawn from the market now.
[3:40:13.920 --> 3:40:18.920]  No one should get them. No one should get boosted. No one should get double boosted.
[3:40:18.920 --> 3:40:22.920]  They are a dangerous and ineffective product at this point against Omicron.
[3:40:22.920 --> 3:40:28.920]  The spike that they make your body make that you then produce antibodies to is not the Omicron spike.
[3:40:28.920 --> 3:40:37.920]  And earlier today, Tony Fauci said we're not going to give people monoclonal antibody products because the first generation products because they don't work against the Omicron spike.
[3:40:37.920 --> 3:40:42.920]  The same logic applies to these mRNA vaccines and giving people...
[3:40:42.920 --> 3:40:45.920]  And by the way, the same logic doesn't apply, Alex. You need to go further.
[3:40:45.920 --> 3:40:54.920]  Okay. They're withholding and have been withholding working treatments, not just monoclonal antibodies, not just ivermectin, not just inhaled butasinide,
[3:40:54.920 --> 3:41:00.920]  not just hydroxychloroquine, not just vitamin drips, not just other types of steroids. I could continue.
[3:41:00.920 --> 3:41:06.920]  They refuse people ibuprofen. Alex. All right. So I'm glad that you're coming forward.
[3:41:06.920 --> 3:41:13.920]  Meanwhile, again, ABC is smiling that your six-month-old is going to get three.
[3:41:13.920 --> 3:41:18.920]  Okay. Berenson is telling you they're an ineffective product and they need to be taken off the market.
[3:41:18.920 --> 3:41:25.920]  You know, the next day after this aired, Fauci and the CDC had got asked about it and they just went with their talking points.
[3:41:25.920 --> 3:41:29.920]  They ignored it. They act like this data doesn't exist.
[3:41:29.920 --> 3:41:38.920]  Boosters, even if in the very short term it knocks down infection rates, there's a boomerang effect and that's what they're seeing in all these countries.
[3:41:38.920 --> 3:41:41.920]  We are at a dangerous moment and these products need to be withdrawn.
[3:41:41.920 --> 3:41:48.920]  So you say they're ineffective and that's demonstrable to anybody who lives in this country, everyone you know who's had it, you know, has had COVID, most of them are fine.
[3:41:48.920 --> 3:41:52.920]  But when you say they're dangerous, what do you mean by that?
[3:41:52.920 --> 3:42:00.920]  Well, there was a JAMA paper today actually that showed that rates of myocarditis, you know, which is, again, a heart inflammation that can be very dangerous
[3:42:00.920 --> 3:42:08.920]  and, you know, can affect people of any age, but myocarditis in young men actually in college age, people, you know, especially men,
[3:42:08.920 --> 3:42:14.920]  is 50 to 100 times as high as the background rate after the second shot.
[3:42:14.920 --> 3:42:20.920]  There's another issue here which is that these, when I say that there's danger, there's danger and the danger is dose-related, okay?
[3:42:20.920 --> 3:42:23.920]  That's a general rule in medicine. The dose makes the poison.
[3:42:23.920 --> 3:42:24.920]  And giving...
[3:42:24.920 --> 3:42:29.920]  The dose makes the poison. Three shots for your infant.
[3:42:29.920 --> 3:42:33.920]  Berenson went far. He didn't go far enough.
[3:42:33.920 --> 3:42:43.920]  Now, on the flip side of this, we're going to show you a couple clips, including Prince Philip, the recently deceased, talking about how humanity is really at plague-like proportions.
[3:42:43.920 --> 3:42:53.920]  Back in the 1984 era, this is The Alex Jones Show. I am Jason Firmas. Get over to infoorstore.com and support the broadcast.
[3:42:53.920 --> 3:42:55.920]  We love you. We'll see you on the flip.
[3:42:55.920 --> 3:42:59.920]  Sold out for months. X3 is now back in stock.
[3:42:59.920 --> 3:43:07.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game-changing, our products are game-changing, and so many people are deficient in iodine.
[3:43:07.920 --> 3:43:16.920]  It's not the soil anymore. Most of the ocean is contaminated, but when you get high-quality triiodine, all three of the healthy types together,
[3:43:16.920 --> 3:43:21.920]  it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido, but most importantly, your immune system.
[3:43:21.920 --> 3:43:31.920]  So, X3, the only triiodine on the market, highest grade, is now exclusively available again at 50% off at infoorstore.com.
[3:43:31.920 --> 3:43:39.920]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body takes about two weeks to get on average, you really need to experience X3.
[3:43:39.920 --> 3:43:42.920]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.
[3:43:42.920 --> 3:43:47.920]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing what it does for your body.
[3:43:47.920 --> 3:43:52.920]  It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen, and it funds the info or a true 360 win.
[3:43:52.920 --> 3:43:56.920]  So again, X3, back in stock, 50% off at limited time.
[3:43:56.920 --> 3:44:04.920]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's happening in the atmosphere.
[3:44:04.920 --> 3:44:12.920]  But if you look at all the different studies and reports about NASA and other governments and other agencies, they all disagree on what's really happening with the climate.
[3:44:12.920 --> 3:44:17.920]  The only constant, the only great truth is change is the only constant.
[3:44:17.920 --> 3:44:20.920]  So yes, climate change is totally real.
[3:44:20.920 --> 3:44:27.920]  But notice first they called it global freezing back in the 70s and 80s, and then it's going to be global warming, and when that didn't really happen the way they wanted it to.
[3:44:27.920 --> 3:44:29.920]  Okay, now it's just climate change.
[3:44:29.920 --> 3:44:39.920]  But did you know that manmade climate change is a real thing when it comes to the United Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN?
[3:44:39.920 --> 3:44:46.920]  They have weather control trees from 1979, and Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time.
[3:44:46.920 --> 3:44:53.920]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[3:44:53.920 --> 3:44:56.920]  So yes, manmade climate change is real.
[3:44:56.920 --> 3:45:11.920]  For only 72 hours, our groundbreaking course that helps you break free of the globalist mind control matrix, Reset Wars, Mind Wars Spirit Wars is 50% off at resetwars.com.

[3:45:26.920 --> 3:45:33.920]  This points out the tools that God created and has already given you, but that most people forgot or never discovered.

[3:47:06.920 --> 3:47:26.920]  ResetWars.com.
[3:47:26.920 --> 3:47:39.920]  Now, aside from the Prince Philip clip, which we will be playing, Alex highlighted geoengineering, solar radiation management, and how this has now been going on for decades.
[3:47:39.920 --> 3:47:43.920]  Well, I put out a film in 2013 with Shepard Ambelis.
[3:47:43.920 --> 3:47:54.920]  It's heavy on the Alex Jones that not only exposes the true power structure, but gets into both geoengineering and bioengineering,
[3:47:54.920 --> 3:47:59.920]  including, yes, medical experiments that were done on who?
[3:47:59.920 --> 3:48:07.920]  Us, by our government, through the Department of Energy and others post-World War II.
[3:48:07.920 --> 3:48:13.920]  It's something that we have to, have to, have to acknowledge if we want to understand what's going on in the world.
[3:48:13.920 --> 3:48:19.920]  Also, very Bill Gates heavy, by the way, Warren Buffett heavy, Ted Turner, good guys called heavy.
[3:48:19.920 --> 3:48:24.920]  They had warned people about this a decade ago, oh wait, I did. Alex Jones did.
[3:48:24.920 --> 3:48:28.920]  That's why these broadcasts are so important.
[3:48:28.920 --> 3:48:34.920]  But what we're really going to start is one of those experiments, and this is what?
[3:48:34.920 --> 3:48:49.920]  Cadium sulfite, okay, cadium sulfite being poured on you in St. Louis, Missouri, in the skies and through station wagons and the tops of buildings.
[3:48:49.920 --> 3:49:04.920]  I didn't think it could possibly be true, but after receiving thousands of records and declassified reports from the Army, it's confirmed that during the Cold War, the United States military conducted secret tests on unsuspecting people in the city of St. Louis.
[3:49:04.920 --> 3:49:15.920]  Lisa Martino-Taylor's life work has been to uncover details of the Army's ultra-secret military experiments carried out in St. Louis and other cities during the 1950s and 60s.
[3:49:15.920 --> 3:49:26.920]  This thing was secretive for a reason, and they didn't have volunteers stepping up and saying, yeah, I'll breathe zinc cadmium sulfide with radioactive particles.
[3:49:26.920 --> 3:49:39.920]  These Army archive pictures show how the tests were done in Corpus Christi, Texas in the 1960s. In Texas, planes were used to drop the chemical, but in St. Louis, the Army placed chemical sprayers on buildings and station wagons.
[3:49:39.920 --> 3:49:54.920]  City officials were kept in the dark about the tests. The Cold War cover story was that the Army was testing smoke screens to protect cities from a Russian attack. The truth, according to Martino-Taylor, was much more sinister.
[3:49:54.920 --> 3:50:08.920]  So let's just stop it right there. The cover story, oh wait, the Defense Department's allowed to lie to the American people? They have cover stories? Couldn't be what's going on in this COVID-1984 nightmare.
[3:50:08.920 --> 3:50:26.920]  And speaking of 1984, this is what, and by the way, take a look, guys, please go watch this. This is one of my best and well-produced works, again, big on the Bill Gates, explains the war in Buffett, goes over the geoengineering and the bioengineering.
[3:50:26.920 --> 3:50:34.920]  But right here, there's the Good Guys Club. There they are. There's Buffett. Yeah, he's such a nice man with an ice cream cone. And the Good Guys Club here to save you.
[3:50:34.920 --> 3:50:45.920]  Really what this is about is the dehumanization. Oh, there's Teddy Turner telling you he wants two billion people. Should we play that clip? Should we play Mr. United Nations Foundation himself? We'll stick that in.
[3:50:45.920 --> 3:50:48.920]  Because humans are so bad. You think I'm kidding?
[3:50:48.920 --> 3:50:56.920]  Foundation and has called for a massive population reduction. Well, one of our members, Gary, actually, acted like he was for population control.
[3:50:56.920 --> 3:51:08.920]  Mr. Turner. Mr. Turner, I was wondering if you think it's a good idea to reduce 90% of the population because we are being overpopulated by a lot of...
[3:51:08.920 --> 3:51:09.920]  90%.
[3:51:09.920 --> 3:51:15.920]  80? Prince Philip said 80, sir. I go with 85.
[3:51:15.920 --> 3:51:17.920]  I think two billion is about right.
[3:51:17.920 --> 3:51:25.920]  Two billion is about right. Now, we won't play the clip where he gets confronted on that and he walks away. But you can watch that here.
[3:51:25.920 --> 3:51:35.920]  But what you're looking at here is Webster Tarpley describing this generational idea that we're overpopulated.
[3:51:35.920 --> 3:51:43.920]  And human beings that are not oligarchs, part of the predator class power structure, are really animals.
[3:51:43.920 --> 3:52:06.920]  Okay?
[3:52:06.920 --> 3:52:14.920]  People of wealth and family and whatever other criteria that they may want to drag out, these are inherently superior.
[3:52:14.920 --> 3:52:26.920]  But the basis of it all is this colossal increase in the human population. It's one of the living species of the planet, but it's reaching plague proportions.
[3:52:26.920 --> 3:52:40.920]  So there it is right there. Prince Philip in 1984, ironically, telling you that human beings are at plague-like proportions.
[3:52:40.920 --> 3:52:48.920]  All right? We're at about eight billion people on this planet and Ted says we need two.
[3:52:48.920 --> 3:53:01.920]  That guy at a time, when westernized living, okay, usually it was a one-car home, sometimes two cars, a lot less people, a lot less pollution.
[3:53:01.920 --> 3:53:08.920]  And Ted Turner will tell you the reason we have climate change, aka global warming, because he calls it global warming back when he's talking to Charlie Rose,
[3:53:08.920 --> 3:53:12.920]  is because you've got too many people doing too many things.
[3:53:12.920 --> 3:53:23.920]  Well, Ted Turner and his ilk, Warren Buffett and his ilk, okay, Bill Gates and his ilk, Prince Philip and his cronies, they're not going anywhere.
[3:53:23.920 --> 3:53:39.920]  So who is and why? As they get you prepared, not for the track-trace database society they already have in place, but a very real transhumanist agenda.
[3:53:39.920 --> 3:53:44.920]  And that's why I focus on this so much because things are moving at a rapid pace.
[3:53:44.920 --> 3:53:50.920]  These people need to be exposed. And by the way, that film, along with all my stuff, is all free.
[3:53:50.920 --> 3:53:54.920]  You can watch it uncensored over at rockfin.com.
[3:53:54.920 --> 3:54:02.920]  And we have just expanded. I'm on Spotify now. I'm making these into audio broadcasts.
[3:54:02.920 --> 3:54:05.920]  We're putting video podcasts on Podbean.
[3:54:05.920 --> 3:54:18.920]  We're trying to expand on this end as well because it is going to take expansion of truly independent media that is not about right or left but always about right and wrong
[3:54:18.920 --> 3:54:31.920]  and exposing what is going on and challenging the great narrative and this great reset agenda that is repackaged, globalist, new world order garbajo.
[3:54:31.920 --> 3:54:39.920]  That's all it is. That's all it is. And they want to have their way with you. They want to have their way with your kids.
[3:54:39.920 --> 3:54:46.920]  You think it just ends with a multitude of shots for your toddler for this thing. It doesn't.
[3:54:46.920 --> 3:55:01.920]  They're trying to give your children autonomy over their bodies without their parents permission to take more hate and lie shots in other states as young as nine, as young as nine.
[3:55:01.920 --> 3:55:08.920]  And then as Alex showed you, there is this mass movement to lower the age of consent. And why is this?
[3:55:08.920 --> 3:55:21.920]  Well, as they program and dehumanize your kids, as they take away their faces and their interactions with others, they say you're really smart and you're actually smarter than your parents and you can decide.
[3:55:21.920 --> 3:55:33.920]  And they'll be able to decide that they can sit in a kiosk, a robot kiosk brought to you by Elon Musk, the new savior, my arse, the new savior.
[3:55:33.920 --> 3:55:44.920]  And you'll sit there in about six hours. They'll weave a nice little brain ship through four fiber optic cables and you'll be able to learn languages and learn math and you won't even really need an education.
[3:55:44.920 --> 3:55:58.920]  All the information you need will be pumped in directly and you will be rewarded with endorphins when you go along with that great narrative they are currently trying to sell you on.
[3:55:58.920 --> 3:56:06.920]  And it is a great delusion. It is one of lies. It is one that will take away your humanity and your free will as you know it.
[3:56:06.920 --> 3:56:12.920]  And this is all real. We've got over the documents. We have the documents, folks, and we've been over them.
[3:56:12.920 --> 3:56:16.920]  I would encourage everybody to check out my source material.
[3:56:16.920 --> 3:56:34.920]  But in these last 90 seconds, I want to give a big shout out to Alex Jones. I can't imagine what it would be like to be involved in these type of court cases on top of trying to run a media operation at the level that Alex does.
[3:56:34.920 --> 3:56:47.920]  And that's why I am encouraging you right now to go to infowarstore.com, get whatever you want, including some of the great documentary films.
[3:56:47.920 --> 3:57:06.920]  The great filmmaker, I mean, A plus grade films that you can show people to expose this nightmare. I mean, it came out this week that the White House is worried that Zombie J, a.k.a. Joey B, a.k.a. Joe Biden, the poopy pants puppet president, the worry he might get COVID.
[3:57:06.920 --> 3:57:22.920]  Because then it's going to show everybody how safe and effective it really is. And I mean, the guys allowed to say whatever he wants and he said what it was going to prevent you from transmission or infection, something they had no data on, no data to provide at all, at all, at all.
[3:57:22.920 --> 3:57:38.920]  That's why they want to hide it from you. So go to saveinfowars.com, make that donation, infowarstore.com, make that purchase and support independent media. Today I am Jason Bermas. You can find me across the board and all those documentary films are free.
[3:57:38.920 --> 3:57:53.920]  And I want to thank Alex Jones for producing several of them and appearing in others. We'll see on the flip.
[3:58:08.920 --> 3:58:24.920]  You need to get prepared now with high quality, storeable food that is ready to ship. And it's been four years since my Patriot supply at preparewithalix.com has offered their storeable food at 25% off for years.
[3:58:24.920 --> 3:58:38.920]  But right now it's 25% off until February 13, 2022, a little over two weeks from the time I'm cutting this to get 25% off at preparewithalix.com on the entire catalog of my Patriot supply.
[3:58:38.920 --> 3:58:46.920]  Act now, get prepared now. This is absolutely essential for everybody that wants to be self-sufficient.
[3:58:46.920 --> 3:59:06.920]  I want to explain something that is absolutely key to understanding our world. It's very, very simple, but the most people don't know. The privately owned central banks of the world are artificially creating thousands of trillions of dollars and other major currencies and using them to buy up infrastructure,
[3:59:06.920 --> 3:59:24.920]  intellectual property, energy. They're using it to buy people, to buy influence. And in the past they created thousands of trillions so that they could leverage that manipulated market so they never allowed that money to get into the general circulation or it would cause massive inflation.
[3:59:24.920 --> 3:59:40.920]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy, buying up everything, not to have the companies operate, but to actually shut them down and force the collapse of civilization, making the companies they do fund be the only things left standing.
[3:59:40.920 --> 3:59:55.920]  This is the great reset. This is what's happening now. Warn everyone. It's the only way to stop it.
