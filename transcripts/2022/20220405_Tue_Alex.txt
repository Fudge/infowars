[00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:05.514]  This is the New World Order future, where the prisons are emptied of criminals and filled with good people.
[00:00:05.814 --> 00:00:07.095]  This is the judicial tyranny.
[00:00:07.335 --> 00:00:13.841]  That's why now more than ever, you must override them with your word of mouth, spreading this live feed, because it is the tip of the spear.
[00:00:13.901 --> 00:00:17.864]  It is the bat signal fired out to humanity to awaken and say no.
[00:00:18.325 --> 00:00:20.006]  Infowars is the standard of resistance.
[00:00:20.526 --> 00:00:21.647]  You are the standard of resistance.
[00:00:21.908 --> 00:00:23.409]  And that's why our work is so critical.
[00:00:23.729 --> 00:00:25.150]  I am honored to be enemy number one.
[00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.611]  I am honored to have the enemy come after me first.
[00:00:27.651 --> 00:00:31.633]  But understand, as Trump always says, they're trying to get through me to get to you.
[00:00:31.713 --> 00:00:38.713]   From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.713 --> 00:00:54.713]  [Music]
[00:00:54.713 --> 00:00:59.713]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:59.713 --> 00:01:00.713]  [SPLAT]
[00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.700]  It's Tuesday, April 5th.
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.300]  The year is 2022.
[00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.963]  I'm Alex Jones coming to you from Connecticut.
[00:01:08.078 --> 00:01:17.661]  Owen Troyer is about to be taking over from the ATX here in just a few minutes, and I've got several extremely informative reports coming up in this hour as well that I taped earlier.
[00:01:18.041 --> 00:01:20.462]  But first, I want to make this perfectly clear.
[00:01:21.543 --> 00:01:30.346]  We warned the world four and a half years ago when I got deplatformed, debanked, and persecuted at Communist Chinese levels.
[00:01:31.581 --> 00:01:39.203]  That the reason I was being demonized was because Infowars was seen as a symbol of the American populist and a symbol of resistance worldwide.
[00:01:39.563 --> 00:01:48.506]  And if we continue to succeed, 1776 worldwide would occur with people declaring their independence against the World Economic Forum.
[00:01:49.446 --> 00:01:50.587]  And the globalist New World Order.
[00:01:51.387 --> 00:01:53.369]  That's why I'm enemy number one.
[00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:57.832]  And understanding why I'm enemy number one is the key to bringing them down.
[00:01:58.392 --> 00:02:12.322]  And supporting and keeping us on air is critical because the enemy is obsessed with destroying us and taking us off air so they can steal our identity and misrepresent who we are worldwide and kill the idea of the American rugged individualist and populist.
[00:02:12.342 --> 00:02:14.484]  So we are all at the tip of the spear.
[00:02:14.844 --> 00:02:16.786]  The viewers and listeners of the show are so precious.
[00:02:17.446 --> 00:02:21.288]  We told you first they came for Alex Jones, then they came for everybody else.
[00:02:21.348 --> 00:02:28.431]  And now here in Connecticut with literally kangaroo trials where I can't defend myself and I'm already guilty when it goes to the jury.
[00:02:29.898 --> 00:02:37.343]  They are literally setting the precedent and bragging to get rid of populists and conservatives and veterans and police officers and you name it.
[00:02:37.703 --> 00:02:38.503]  Due process.
[00:02:39.024 --> 00:02:44.807]  So this is an authoritarian reign of terror taking place to shut down free speech and silence opposition.
[00:02:45.447 --> 00:02:51.391]  So this is the next level of the takeover is now physically bankrupting people and putting them in jail for their speech.
[00:02:51.651 --> 00:02:52.692]  Look at the January 6th people.
[00:02:52.892 --> 00:02:55.554]  Some of them totally peaceful, still in jail.
[00:02:56.354 --> 00:03:02.640]  But Kamala Harris was bailing people out that were burning down people's buildings, including attacking federal buildings with Molotov cocktails.
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.401]  That's all mostly peaceful and good.
[00:03:04.861 --> 00:03:07.684]  But when conservatives walk in the Capitol peacefully, they get arrested.
[00:03:08.124 --> 00:03:13.409]  This is the New World Order future, where the prisons are emptied of criminals and filled with good people.
[00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:15.010]  This is the judicial tyranny.
[00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.754]  That's why now more than ever, you must override them with your word of mouth, spreading this live feed, because it is the tip of the spear.
[00:03:21.814 --> 00:03:25.776]  It is the bat signal fired out to humanity to awaken and say no.
[00:03:26.236 --> 00:03:27.917]  Infowars is the standard of resistance.
[00:03:28.438 --> 00:03:29.558]  You are the standard of resistance.
[00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.359]  And that's why our work is so critical.
[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.101]  I am honored to be enemy number one.
[00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:35.542]  I am honored to have the enemy come after me first.
[00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:39.564]  But understand, as Trump always says, they're trying to get through me to get to you.
[00:03:39.624 --> 00:03:45.149]   So please, Keep us on air, keep us in your prayers, and financially support us at Infowarshore.com.
[00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:54.208]  Owen Schroer takes over.
[00:03:54.193 --> 00:04:00.296]  We're going to be airing through the transmission here today on this Tuesday, April 5th, 2022.
[00:04:00.916 --> 00:04:09.060]  We've also got a great guest coming on who was one of the first people to break the story about the bio labs in Ukraine.
[00:04:09.341 --> 00:04:16.344]  And we're going to get his take on the bio labs, Russia targeting the bio labs, the Biden involvement in the bio labs.
[00:04:18.454 --> 00:04:19.514]  And all of that.
[00:04:20.475 --> 00:04:24.055]  And then here's what I have on my desk before we come back with an Alex Jones report.
[00:04:25.236 --> 00:04:31.397]  Big news is breaking when it comes to the election theft that took place in 2020.
[00:04:32.118 --> 00:04:35.158]  The presidential election theft.
[00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:38.499]  We've got big breaking news on that.
[00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:44.901]  There are some developments in the Russia versus the globalist narrative and that's what it is.
[00:04:45.703 --> 00:04:56.057]  Yeah, you have Russia going into Ukraine and they've got their agenda there, but then you have the globalist agenda that's anti-Russia, and they're making moves right now just stealing Russians' property.
[00:04:56.097 --> 00:04:57.499]  Just saying, oh, you're a Russian billionaire?
[00:04:57.519 --> 00:04:59.501]  We're just going to take all your money, we're going to take your property.
[00:04:59.521 --> 00:05:00.583]  Just, oh, okay.
[00:05:01.063 --> 00:05:02.786]  So that's the globalists doing that.
[00:05:04.684 --> 00:05:11.446]  There's a slew of news stories today discussing mental health in this country and what's going on with women and children.
[00:05:11.806 --> 00:05:17.628]  Ah, well, what is the left targeted more than anything else culturally in this country?
[00:05:17.688 --> 00:05:18.668]  The women and children.
[00:05:18.808 --> 00:05:22.029]  Why are their suicide rates and mental health rates skyrocketing?
[00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:23.550]  Because that's what liberalism is.
[00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:24.430]  It's a mental disorder.
[00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:31.212]  We do also have some COVID news, some just incredible political news when it comes to what Biden and Harris are up to.
[00:05:31.892 --> 00:05:33.313]  It's really quite an embarrassment.
[00:05:33.593 --> 00:05:36.074]  All that and more coming up on today's Alex Jones Show.
[00:05:37.494 --> 00:06:00.644]  Because democracy basically means government by the people, of the people, for the people.
[00:06:03.783 --> 00:06:07.783]  but the people are retarded.
[00:06:07.783 --> 00:06:23.783]   So let us say, government by the retarded, for the retarded,
[00:06:30.783 --> 00:06:32.783]  of the retarded.
[00:06:32.783 --> 00:06:34.443]  (laughter)
[00:06:34.588 --> 00:06:51.278]  Even the famous cult leader guru, Osho, understood the danger of the mad howl of pure democracy that the author of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson, warned the world about in a republic.
[00:06:53.191 --> 00:06:58.156]  You generally have two parties so that the people can balance power between those.
[00:06:58.196 --> 00:07:03.881]  You try to separate the government into different factions in our country.
[00:07:03.921 --> 00:07:06.623]  We have the legislative, the executive, and the judicial.
[00:07:07.705 --> 00:07:22.819]  And it is that separation of powers that stops cults, or gangs, or organized crime syndicates, or dictators, oligarchies, to be able to get control.
[00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:26.483]  Because you don't just split up the federal government into three branches.
[00:07:27.103 --> 00:07:32.348]  You then separate federal and state power, and then you have state and local power.
[00:07:33.109 --> 00:07:35.173]  Because it all comes from we the people.
[00:07:35.213 --> 00:07:43.530]  It's all designed to stop the type of tyrannies that have been seen destroying amazing civilizations throughout history.
[00:07:44.997 --> 00:08:02.226]  And so when we see what's happening in the world today under radical leftist bullying, it's mega-corporations coming in and taking over governments, getting their politicians and operatives into place, who swear allegiance to the code of the Davos Group, which is the Bilderberg Group.
[00:08:02.446 --> 00:08:03.647]  Klaus Schwab heads up both.
[00:08:04.167 --> 00:08:07.609]  And their goal, you're now seeing it, is a post-industrial world.
[00:08:08.089 --> 00:08:12.731]   Feudalism making you very, very poor, And that's just the people that are allowed to survive.
[00:08:13.212 --> 00:08:16.454]  They want at least a 90% population reduction.
[00:08:16.874 --> 00:08:21.217]  Then the globalists have their private jets, their huge estates, their fabulous wealth.
[00:08:21.637 --> 00:08:23.158]  They enjoy all the technology.
[00:08:23.498 --> 00:08:24.799]  They enjoy all the medicine.
[00:08:25.239 --> 00:08:26.740]  They enjoy the culture.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.842]  You get starved to death and killed.
[00:08:30.522 --> 00:08:32.824]  So this is really the issue of our age.
[00:08:33.004 --> 00:08:36.026]  And this is the issue for all of human history now.
[00:08:36.606 --> 00:08:40.689]   If we allow ourselves to go under, This incredible tyranny.
[00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.993]  Just a few weeks ago, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright died.
[00:08:45.854 --> 00:08:54.102]  And the media around the world celebrated her as just the most wonderful thing ever because she was the first Secretary of State who was a female.
[00:08:55.287 --> 00:09:02.952]  But if you look at what she actually did, she supported wars, she supported sanctions that killed millions and millions of people.
[00:09:03.713 --> 00:09:15.780]  And just in Iraq, it was estimated by the UN, 500,000 plus children just under the sanctions that she put on Iraq during Bill Clinton's administration.
[00:09:16.701 --> 00:09:27.863]  Herbert Walker had already put some sanctions on them, but the Clintons tripled it at her suggestion, and they wouldn't even let basic antibiotics get into the country, and a half million children died.
[00:09:28.303 --> 00:09:32.424]  And she famously said that it was a good price to pay.
[00:09:33.325 --> 00:09:35.745]  We have heard that a half a million children have died.
[00:09:36.605 --> 00:09:41.866]  I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima.
[00:09:42.026 --> 00:09:44.967]  And, you know, is the price worth it?
[00:09:46.067 --> 00:09:50.688]  I think this is a very hard choice, but the price, we think the price is worth it.
[00:09:51.308 --> 00:10:12.678]   It's important on this April 5th, 2022 Tuesday broadcast to pull back at a 35,000 foot view and ask yourself, why is the entire leftist media, the corporate media, From Japan, to Europe, to the UK, Australia, the US, praising this woman two weeks after she died.
[00:10:12.698 --> 00:10:13.859]  It's still all over television.
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.161]  It's still all over the newspapers.
[00:10:16.221 --> 00:10:16.482]  Why?
[00:10:17.402 --> 00:10:27.051]  Because they're rewriting history, ladies and gentlemen, while they pick out other individuals and groups who they want to villainize, who they want to demonize.
[00:10:27.551 --> 00:10:30.113]  And it's only when the public has very short attention spans.
[00:10:30.934 --> 00:10:35.897]  And does it know about history that they're able to be manipulated with this information?
[00:10:36.157 --> 00:10:37.578]  Here's a case point example.
[00:10:38.699 --> 00:10:49.486]  If you go out and ask the general public about Sandy Hook ten years ago, a bunch of children being shot to death in Sandy Hook, Connecticut, people are going to say, Alex Jones.
[00:10:50.726 --> 00:10:51.607]  Believe me, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:10:51.667 --> 00:10:52.608]  I experienced it on the street.
[00:10:53.888 --> 00:10:56.050]  Some people walk up to me and say, you killed the children.
[00:10:57.233 --> 00:10:58.634]  That's mind control.
[00:10:58.734 --> 00:11:00.335]  That's a dumbed down population.
[00:11:00.615 --> 00:11:06.438]  But that's how the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton five years ago, six years ago, when Trump was winning, got upset.
[00:11:06.478 --> 00:11:08.579]  They knew that I was leading a major populist movement.
[00:11:09.779 --> 00:11:10.680]  They said, what do we do?
[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:16.363]  Well, we look at Jones's history, things he's covered, things he's questioned, and we make him the Sandy Hook man.
[00:11:18.106 --> 00:11:25.748]  And then anytime people talk about Alex Jones, we get to bring Sandy Hook back up and go after everybody's guns again.
[00:11:25.848 --> 00:11:32.770]  But more importantly, use the attack on Alex Jones to set the precedent to then take people's free speech away.
[00:11:33.411 --> 00:11:37.652]  And again, this could only be done with an extremely dumbed down public.
[00:11:38.012 --> 00:11:41.033]  And so what's happened is we don't have a separation of powers to a great extent anymore.
[00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:56.848]  And we have the judicial branch that is becoming its own tyranny and that is engaging in any type of activity they wish because there's no real checks and balances on them.
[00:11:56.868 --> 00:12:12.635]   So when you have the perfect storm of a dumbed down, historically illiterate population with mega corporations that are extremely predatory, You get a perfect storm of what they call technocratic tyranny.
[00:12:13.136 --> 00:12:22.380]  And that's what this whole cashless society, programmable money systems that are being announced and the world government that's being announced is actually rolling out right now.
[00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:26.020]   Now remember that same corporate media for decades told you world government doesn't
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:32.220]   exist, new world order doesn't exist, there's no Bilderberg group, and now it's all out
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:37.879]   in the open because they're going from beta, accelerating into operational.
[00:12:37.879 --> 00:12:43.760]   Everybody needs to be concerned about this going into operational because its plan is
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:49.120]   at least 80% depopulation by 2030 and you can see how that's now beginning all over
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.300]  the world.
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.300]  We must become the checks and balances again.
[00:12:53.174 --> 00:12:54.716]  We must identify who the enemies are.
[00:12:55.116 --> 00:12:56.837]  We must understand how they manipulated us.
[00:12:56.878 --> 00:13:04.384]  And we've got to say, why is Madeleine Albright a hero when she gave the orders to kill a half a million children and said on TV she was proud of it?
[00:13:05.305 --> 00:13:14.893]  How is George Soros, the admitted Nazi collaborator that bankrupted more than 20 nations systems and stole old people's pension funds, how is he a hero but Alex Jones is bad?
[00:13:15.794 --> 00:13:22.098]  This is bigger than Alex Jones, but just think about the power of the corporate media to demonize someone for questioning events.
[00:13:22.698 --> 00:13:28.862]  There's been so many staged events in history, and that's the ultimate crime, is questioning the official narrative.
[00:13:29.122 --> 00:13:33.785]  But when you actually kill a half million children deliberately, it's now a good thing.
[00:13:34.185 --> 00:13:38.686]   That is nothing less than mind control. So when we see men posing as women
[00:13:38.686 --> 00:13:45.335]   wearing admiral outfits and men in women's wrestling choking out women and when we see open borders
[00:13:45.335 --> 00:13:50.785]   and we see the Supreme Court justice nominee says she can't say what a woman is and we witness
[00:13:50.785 --> 00:13:56.806]   the devaluation of our currency and all of this, this is the checks and balances of good people not
[00:13:56.806 --> 00:14:02.325]   being involved being removed and into that vacuum comes all the tyrants, all the criminals, all
[00:14:02.325 --> 00:14:03.164]  the evil people.
[00:14:03.385 --> 00:14:06.747]  Thomas Jefferson was asked, what is the level of tyranny humans will live under?
[00:14:06.767 --> 00:14:09.308]  And he said, it is the level to which you will accept.
[00:14:09.728 --> 00:14:12.870]  There's always someone more evil to come into the vacuum.
[00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:14.651]  When good people don't stand up.
[00:14:15.371 --> 00:14:16.812]  And so it's accelerating.
[00:14:17.372 --> 00:14:19.974]  It's getting worse and worse by the day.
[00:14:20.694 --> 00:14:28.759]  And people have to understand that being lazy, not being engaged, going along with political correctness is basically sucking the oxygen out of the room and it's going to destroy us.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:35.303]  And that having courage and questioning and being involved and standing up against censorship is the answer.
[00:14:35.604 --> 00:14:46.267]   There's an article on Infowars.com today by Paul Watson where the big national museum of art in the UK is changing the names of art, taking any names
[00:14:46.267 --> 00:14:49.067]   that basically say Russian off of them.
[00:14:49.067 --> 00:14:54.426]   We have to decide who we are and what we stand for or we're going to lose our entire culture,
[00:14:54.426 --> 00:14:55.745]  our entire civilization.
[00:14:55.745 --> 00:14:57.866]  It really just comes down to that.
[00:14:57.866 --> 00:15:01.625]   It's the decision that all of us have to make because things are only going to get worse
[00:15:01.625 --> 00:15:02.625]  the more we live in denial.
[00:15:02.625 --> 00:15:05.507]   It's only going to get better by standing up and doing the right thing.
[00:15:05.532 --> 00:15:07.615]  Some of us will be demonized who are at the tip of the spear.
[00:15:07.895 --> 00:15:08.536]  That's okay.
[00:15:08.876 --> 00:15:14.363]  I volunteered for this because not standing up and being a total slave is a fate far worse.
[00:15:16.491 --> 00:15:21.294]  And we are back on this special Tuesday, April 5th edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:15:21.695 --> 00:15:22.555]  Thank you for tuning in.
[00:15:22.575 --> 00:15:25.037]  And again, thank you for spreading the word about the broadcast.
[00:15:25.157 --> 00:15:28.679]  You are the power that takes this information to the next level.
[00:15:28.739 --> 00:15:36.544]  You are who is able to override big tech censors and the globalists who are fighting tooth and nail to suppress the voice of the people.
[00:15:36.584 --> 00:15:39.166]  So together, we are going to defeat these globalists.
[00:15:39.186 --> 00:15:44.250]  And I again, thank you all for taking action and realizing how important your word of mouth is to override their tyranny.
[00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:47.772]   Separately, Oh, and Troyer's about to take over.
[00:15:47.812 --> 00:15:54.835]  I just want to remind listeners that we are fighting the globalists at point-blank range with every ounce of energy and will and finances we have.
[00:15:55.196 --> 00:15:57.417]  And without you, we will not be able to continue on.
[00:15:58.017 --> 00:16:00.578]  Plus, we have great products at Infolwerestore.com.
[00:16:00.918 --> 00:16:02.339]  Take advantage of them now.
[00:16:02.659 --> 00:16:05.341]  Palm and Block has been sold out for 11 months.
[00:16:05.901 --> 00:16:11.924]  It is a natural system that is wonderful for allergies and hay fever and so much more.
[00:16:12.424 --> 00:16:15.306]  It is now back in stock, despite the fact it's been sold out for a year.
[00:16:15.766 --> 00:16:20.708]  It is 40% off at InfoWarsTore.com right on time for spring.
[00:16:21.288 --> 00:16:26.150]  Also, we're going to sell out by Friday or so at current sales of the new 1776 coin.
[00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.351]  It's a three-part series.
[00:16:28.431 --> 00:16:29.271]  It's a limited edition.
[00:16:29.631 --> 00:16:31.632]  There will only be 10,000 of this coin made.
[00:16:31.652 --> 00:16:36.234]  There'll be 10,000 of the next coin made, and then that's it, the three-part series.
[00:16:36.394 --> 00:16:44.038]   It's a founder coin, meaning It's being used to really energize our operation and ensure that we're not taken off the air.
[00:16:44.338 --> 00:16:55.743]  And then everybody that does become a founding member by buying the coin, if you put your email in when you get the coin, you'll be sent in the future, very near future, a lot of really, really special, exclusive things.
[00:16:56.224 --> 00:16:59.885]  Unless there's a nuclear war or I get assassinated or put in prison and taken off the air.
[00:16:59.945 --> 00:17:03.927]  But if we're able to keep fighting, founding members will definitely be pleased.
[00:17:05.067 --> 00:17:09.667]   And then finally, there's a lot of other great products at InfowarsTore.com, but we were
[00:17:09.667 --> 00:17:11.946]   doing a lot of accounting trying to find money to pay the payroll.
[00:17:11.946 --> 00:17:14.548]   They're like, "Hey, Alex, we keep telling you, you keep designing new shirts all the
[00:17:14.548 --> 00:17:16.906]  time, but never really promoting them.
[00:17:16.906 --> 00:17:22.267]  So some shirts sell, some don't, but we have 63,000 shirts.
[00:17:22.267 --> 00:17:26.426]   And just sell them at cost, and we'll move them out the door, and then only have a few
[00:17:26.426 --> 00:17:29.208]   shirts that are limited edition here and there that are popular.
[00:17:29.208 --> 00:17:31.586]  That way we don't have half the warehouse full of stuff.
[00:17:31.586 --> 00:17:32.586]  It's killing us."
[00:17:32.586 --> 00:17:35.667]   I'm like, "You're absolutely right," and the listeners have really come through.
[00:17:35.667 --> 00:17:38.507]  We started this special deal on Wednesday.

[00:18:36.524 --> 00:18:38.565]  and then a great guest in the second hour.
[00:18:39.478 --> 00:18:43.180]  Let me just hit some of the news right now before we come back with Alex.
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:48.803]  COVID cases in China hit record as Shanghai extends lockdown.
[00:18:49.223 --> 00:18:56.667]  So yeah, they locked down an entire, basically it'd be like locking down an entire city or even state.
[00:18:56.947 --> 00:19:02.290]  They're trying to test 26 million in Shanghai as their goal to COVID test 26 million.
[00:19:04.761 --> 00:19:10.042]  More than 80% of the country's latest daily cases were in Shanghai, where millions of people were confined to their homes.
[00:19:10.102 --> 00:19:13.803]  So, again, COVID cases hit record.
[00:19:14.303 --> 00:19:15.443]  But is that the story?
[00:19:16.163 --> 00:19:16.383]  No.
[00:19:17.103 --> 00:19:31.146]  The story is that they locked down the entire city of Shanghai, tested, or planned on testing 26 million individuals, and then they say, oh look, 80% of the COVID cases are in Shanghai.
[00:19:31.626 --> 00:19:32.407]  Oh, no kidding!
[00:19:32.527 --> 00:19:34.347]  Where you tested every single person?
[00:19:35.839 --> 00:19:36.199]  Wow!
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.620]  Who could have guessed that would have been the case?
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:42.461]  Folks, you can shut down New York City right now.
[00:19:44.041 --> 00:19:44.901]  Forget about COVID.
[00:19:45.582 --> 00:19:46.822]  You can test for any disease.
[00:19:48.402 --> 00:19:49.123]  How about herpes?
[00:19:50.563 --> 00:20:14.908]   You can go and shut down New York City and test however many million people reside there or however many million people you want in New York City and you can get A large number of people to test positive for herpes, and you can say, massive herpes outbreak in New York City, and then say 90% of new herpes cases are in New York City.
[00:20:14.928 --> 00:20:16.029]  Well, what's the real story there?
[00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:25.658]  It's not that there's herpes in New York City, or that herpes is all of a sudden spreading like wildfire, or maybe that might be the case, but they're not making a big deal of it.
[00:20:26.539 --> 00:20:36.307]   The point is, You can go to any city you want, test millions of people, and get positive test results, and then the media can just say, oh, look, it's an outbreak.
[00:20:37.628 --> 00:20:45.691]  You can do it with any disease, any virus, anything, and then say, oh, wow, most of the new cases are in this city that we locked down and test everybody in.
[00:20:49.733 --> 00:20:51.113]  That should be common sense.
[00:20:52.754 --> 00:20:54.875]  I shouldn't have to explain that, but I do.
[00:20:56.178 --> 00:21:05.322]  Because when the Wall Street Journal reports on it, when all the mainstream news reports on it, they present it at face value like, wow, COVID has really hit Shanghai hard.
[00:21:05.402 --> 00:21:06.743]  It is just brutal there.
[00:21:07.183 --> 00:21:11.825]  No, what's brutal is the oppression of the people.
[00:21:13.206 --> 00:21:26.577]   What's brutal is the fake news media's coverage of it saying that there's a massive outbreak Even though they essentially shut down the city so that they could get the numbers to say there was a massive outbreak.
[00:21:28.778 --> 00:21:32.299]  You'd think it'd be pretty common sense stuff to understand, but it's not.
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.940]  And so we have to explain it.
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.502]  And now Fauci is crawling out of his rat hole.
[00:21:38.563 --> 00:21:43.025]  Fauci's crawling out of his rat hole and he's saying, get ready for more lockdowns here!
[00:21:43.185 --> 00:21:45.306]  I guess he loves what he's seeing in China.
[00:21:46.536 --> 00:21:48.036]  He says it's a good thing.
[00:21:48.116 --> 00:21:49.917]  It's a positive thing to lock down.
[00:21:49.957 --> 00:21:52.257]  It's a good thing to be a prisoner in your own country.
[00:21:52.818 --> 00:21:54.158]  Nobody likes a free country.
[00:21:55.558 --> 00:21:55.778]  Yeah.
[00:21:56.358 --> 00:22:02.720]  I bet Fauci would like everybody locked down because he's afraid that he's going to get a lifelong prison sentence for his crimes against humanity.
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:06.241]  But you know, speaking of that, and I'll just go off on a jag real quick.
[00:22:08.401 --> 00:22:15.163]  I happened to re-watch the movie Dallas Buyers Club this weekend.
[00:22:16.443 --> 00:22:17.604]  And I don't know when it came out.
[00:22:17.664 --> 00:22:18.625]  I saw it when it came out.
[00:22:19.485 --> 00:22:20.846]  It was always a good film.
[00:22:21.346 --> 00:22:27.791]  It's not really my type of film, not really my genre or cinematic experience, but the movie is truly fantastic.
[00:22:29.712 --> 00:22:52.705]   And when you consider that that is based on a true story, and you now have a better idea of Fauci's involvement in the AIDS epidemic in the 80s, and you have a better idea of what the government did during COVID to just us in the last two plus years, And you rewatch that movie with that context and that perspective, it really hits even harder.
[00:22:53.526 --> 00:22:54.766]  Our government hates us, folks.
[00:22:54.966 --> 00:22:55.407]  They hate us.
[00:22:55.627 --> 00:22:56.307]  They want us dead.
[00:22:57.368 --> 00:23:01.170]  And I'll have to come back to this news because I just got to make this point.
[00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:02.530]  You got to understand something.
[00:23:03.551 --> 00:23:13.834]   The rulers of this planet, the people that believe they own this planet, you got to understand, I mean, to be honest, I'm really not even their enemy.
[00:23:14.454 --> 00:23:17.055]  They just hate me for my free speech and my pro-human views.
[00:23:17.515 --> 00:23:21.137]  They actually look at me like, hey, you're educated, you're smart, you're in good shape.
[00:23:21.177 --> 00:23:22.477]  They really don't want to kill me.
[00:23:22.497 --> 00:23:24.038]  They'd rather have a bunch of people like me running around.
[00:23:24.498 --> 00:23:25.698]  They see gay people.
[00:23:26.058 --> 00:23:27.239]  They see trans people.
[00:23:27.639 --> 00:23:28.559]  They see old people.
[00:23:28.599 --> 00:23:29.440]  They see fat people.
[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:30.680]  They literally want you dead.
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:38.123]  And in case you haven't noticed, that's why all the propaganda is aimed at you and aimed at women's wombs and children.
[00:23:39.031 --> 00:23:47.115]  It's a population control agenda, and when they see gay people having gay sex, like in the 80s, they literally wanted you dead, so they gave you a killer drug.
[00:23:48.276 --> 00:24:02.443]  Now look, I've got all the news here in front of me, I've got the political developments, I've got the COVID developments, I've got the cultural rot of the left developments, I've got election fraud developments, I mean, I've got all the news here.
[00:24:02.483 --> 00:24:08.626]  I've got the video clips, I've got the left sexually grooming your children, I mean, it's all here.
[00:24:10.134 --> 00:24:12.114]  And I'll cover all of it today.
[00:24:13.855 --> 00:24:27.878]  But see, it really just all comes down to an understanding that people need to have and a worldview that you may not like, but you have to accept it because it's the reality.
[00:24:31.558 --> 00:24:41.402]   We have a current state of affairs on this planet Where the, I don't even, you can call them the elite, but it's really not even that.
[00:24:42.742 --> 00:25:09.861]   You can talk about the satanic sex cults or the satanic death cults and all that stuff, but what it comes down to, and this has been recorded throughout modern human history, since the founding of this country, I mean George Washington would write his journals about the Illuminati and Sheikah societies and all this stuff, but as The world evolves, so do these secret societies, and so do other factions that want to compete with them.
[00:25:11.802 --> 00:25:24.225]  But at the end of the day, call it whatever you want, the Illuminati, secret societies, shadow government, these groups of people have reached intellectual conclusions.
[00:25:25.802 --> 00:25:34.666]  That if you're a deep thinker, if you're an intellectual person, if you're a logician, we'll say, you've had these same patterns of thought.
[00:25:35.086 --> 00:25:52.141]   And you may have reached different conclusions, you may have reached the same conclusions, but you may have a heart, you may have a soul, you may have a Christian ethos or some other religious ethos that Makes you have love instead of hate, and believe in good instead of evil, and believe in a creator, and that's the ultimate power.
[00:25:52.201 --> 00:25:53.182]  That's the be-all end-all.
[00:25:53.482 --> 00:25:55.663]  Not you or whatever humans do on this planet.
[00:25:56.864 --> 00:25:59.866]  But see, this group of elite don't go off of that logic.
[00:26:01.107 --> 00:26:07.371]  They don't believe in divine creation or your divine existence.
[00:26:08.191 --> 00:26:10.613]  Instead, they look at the planet like it's a business.
[00:26:14.164 --> 00:26:37.621]  The best analogy I could make for you to try to understand this mindset, and this may go over many people's heads, but for me, we grew up with video games like SimCity, or basically these games that just simulate life in some form, and you're in charge of a city, or you're in charge of a civilization or something, and you have to make decisions to make sure the civilization blossoms or whatever.
[00:26:38.461 --> 00:26:41.523]  The point is, that's how they look at the planet.
[00:26:41.743 --> 00:26:43.585]  The whole planet is a commodity to them.
[00:26:45.382 --> 00:26:51.326]  And the daily operations or yearly operations or whatever on the planet are of major concern or cause to them.
[00:26:51.486 --> 00:26:57.430]  So, if they think that there's too many humans on earth, then they're going to try to cull the population.
[00:26:58.331 --> 00:27:09.379]  If they think there's a limited amount of resources and they want them for themselves to sustain themselves or their bloodlines or their lineage or their secret groups, then they're going to make sure that you're not consuming those resources.
[00:27:11.792 --> 00:27:24.058]  So when you understand that mindset, which I don't know if I'm properly presenting, but when you understand that mindset and you look at the world through that perspective, you understand the globalists so much better.
[00:27:24.138 --> 00:27:27.399]  You understand their operating procedure, you understand their motives.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:41.542]   And when you tie that into the response to COVID or the whole entire story of COVID, It actually makes sense.
[00:27:42.943 --> 00:27:49.949]  Now, why do I use the movie Dallas Buyers Club as a prospectus on how to understand this?
[00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:53.192]  Because you watch that movie and you would say, huh?
[00:27:54.634 --> 00:27:56.916]  Because just like with COVID, it was the same story.
[00:27:56.956 --> 00:27:57.516]  It's like, huh?
[00:27:58.397 --> 00:28:00.299]  So we have an AIDS epidemic going on.
[00:28:01.496 --> 00:28:06.919]  We have drugs that we know help people that have AIDS, help extend their life, give them a higher quality of life.
[00:28:07.859 --> 00:28:15.563]  And then we have these drugs over here that are getting pushed by the FDA, that people in high places have investments in, that are killing all the AIDS patients.
[00:28:16.064 --> 00:28:17.704]  We're going to go with that drug instead.
[00:28:17.744 --> 00:28:21.226]  And you would say, well why the heck would that be going on?
[00:28:22.647 --> 00:28:24.048]  That doesn't make any sense.
[00:28:26.269 --> 00:28:27.750]  No, you see, it does make sense.
[00:28:28.939 --> 00:28:39.943]  When you look at the planet as a commodity of yours with scarce resources and a growing consumer base that you need to call.
[00:28:42.705 --> 00:28:49.908]  And so there's a certain level of evil to it and quite frankly there's a certain level of survival of the instincts and humanity to it.
[00:28:51.548 --> 00:28:54.169]  I'm not promoting this idea, I'm just telling you how they think.
[00:28:58.439 --> 00:29:10.525]  In their minds, their logic, their reasoning is, if you're running around and you're engaging in sodomy, and you're getting AIDS because of your gay sex, then you deserve to die!
[00:29:13.026 --> 00:29:13.887]  You deserve to die!
[00:29:14.307 --> 00:29:21.551]  And we're gonna give you a drug that's gonna kill you even faster, because you've made those life decisions.
[00:29:22.811 --> 00:29:31.611]   And so that's how they feel morally about it, in this black magic that they engage in, Is, hey, you chose this lifestyle.
[00:29:33.292 --> 00:29:34.953]  Now you chose to come to us for help.
[00:29:34.973 --> 00:29:35.753]  We're going to kill you.
[00:29:37.454 --> 00:29:38.454]  That happened in the 80s.
[00:29:39.014 --> 00:29:40.115]  Now you've got COVID.
[00:29:40.395 --> 00:29:41.815]  The exact same story.
[00:29:41.855 --> 00:29:44.957]  Now, maybe, maybe AIDS was made in the lab just like COVID?
[00:29:45.257 --> 00:29:45.617]  I don't know.
[00:29:45.977 --> 00:29:47.658]  I'm not, I'm not here to have that discussion.
[00:29:47.678 --> 00:29:48.858]  I've seen the arguments before.
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:54.141]  In fact, I think it was Will Smith, even.
[00:29:54.844 --> 00:29:55.525]  Guys, look that up!
[00:29:55.945 --> 00:29:59.548]  Will Smith actually said at one point in time that AIDS was made in a lab.
[00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:02.971]  That's just an old memory that popped up in my head.
[00:30:03.012 --> 00:30:04.853]  Will Smith claimed AIDS was made in a lab.
[00:30:05.173 --> 00:30:06.515]  So I'm not here to make that argument.
[00:30:07.355 --> 00:30:08.837]  We know COVID was made in a lab.
[00:30:10.318 --> 00:30:16.103]  We know that the treatment that was promoted by Fauci and others was deadly.
[00:30:16.809 --> 00:30:21.633]  With the remdesivir, and with the blowing your lungs out on a ventilator, and now with the vaccines.
[00:30:21.953 --> 00:30:22.934]  All those things are deadly.
[00:30:23.174 --> 00:30:26.857]  So you gotta understand, in their mind, it's like an IQ test.
[00:30:28.638 --> 00:30:39.086]  So maybe it's not a moral test of, are you gonna go out and engage in sodomy, and anal sex, which is a bad life choice.
[00:30:39.467 --> 00:30:42.049]  No judgment here, I mean, it's just true.
[00:30:44.155 --> 00:30:46.576]  And they say, OK, well, you're going to die for that decision.
[00:30:46.937 --> 00:30:57.923]  Well, now it's, oh, if you're dumb enough to get a vaccine, if you're dumb enough to go to the hospital and get put on a ventilator and remdesivir, and you're not going to do any of your research into this, then you deserve to die.
[00:30:58.543 --> 00:30:59.804]  And that's how they look at it.
[00:30:59.904 --> 00:31:02.365]  And they have no qualms in this mindset.
[00:31:03.566 --> 00:31:05.587]  Why do you think they operate with such confidence?
[00:31:07.608 --> 00:31:09.129]  When they launch these operations.
[00:31:09.589 --> 00:31:14.070]  Because in their eyes, from their perspective, their worldview, they're doing a good thing!
[00:31:15.991 --> 00:31:18.072]  They're saving the planet from sodomites.
[00:31:18.392 --> 00:31:22.433]  They're saving the planet from people that are too stupid that'll go put something in their arms.
[00:31:22.753 --> 00:31:30.396]  Like that lady said from the NAACP, I'm not learning about the infusion, I don't care what's in the infusion, I'm just gonna take the infusion.
[00:31:30.596 --> 00:31:31.716]  Well that's stupid.
[00:31:31.776 --> 00:31:32.477]  That's death.
[00:31:33.877 --> 00:31:35.478]  So they think, okay, you believe that?
[00:31:35.498 --> 00:31:36.038]  You're gonna die!
[00:31:36.559 --> 00:31:41.201]  Yeah, they're... Will Smith launches homophobic, anti-AIDS rant in unearned footage.
[00:31:41.742 --> 00:31:46.724]  He actually, guys, he went on 60 Minutes, I think it was in the 90s, with Leslie Stahl, I think it was.
[00:31:48.305 --> 00:31:52.828]  I don't remember who it was, but he went on 60 Minutes, and they brought it up, they were like, so do you believe AIDS was made in a lab?
[00:31:53.248 --> 00:31:58.071]  And he basically refused to answer the question, meaning he probably still believes that, but didn't want to say it on 60 Minutes.
[00:31:59.112 --> 00:32:00.613]  I mean, it was Barbara Walters, actually.
[00:32:01.993 --> 00:32:02.674]  I forget who it was.
[00:32:04.082 --> 00:32:04.962]  It was Barbara Walters.
[00:32:04.982 --> 00:32:06.063]  Thank you, crew.
[00:32:07.503 --> 00:32:13.364]  So, you have to understand this is the world that you live in.
[00:32:16.525 --> 00:32:28.388]  And in their eyes, the people that believe they own this planet, probably been in power for generations of bloodlines, generations, generations, dating back centuries, who knows, even millennia.
[00:32:30.809 --> 00:32:34.691]   In their eyes, They really think they're doing a good thing.
[00:32:35.252 --> 00:32:39.993]  And maybe they're really worshipping Satan, or thinking they're getting messages from Satan, maybe it's total demonic possession.
[00:32:40.833 --> 00:32:41.874]  That's their logic.
[00:32:43.334 --> 00:32:46.035]  You're on a lifeboat in space called Planet Earth.
[00:32:46.455 --> 00:33:00.339]  There's not enough room and resources for everybody, and so they're gonna be the protectors of this planet, and they're gonna call the population, and they're gonna keep it, as they say in the Georgia Guidestones, at a permissible human population of 500 million.
[00:33:00.379 --> 00:33:02.100]  Now, I don't believe any of that!
[00:33:03.317 --> 00:33:04.477]  God made this planet.
[00:33:04.537 --> 00:33:05.518]  God made this life.
[00:33:05.578 --> 00:33:06.758]  God made this experience.
[00:33:07.819 --> 00:33:09.239]  His will will be done.
[00:33:09.279 --> 00:33:10.980]  And we've got plenty of space for everybody.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.540]  But see, that's how the globalists think.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:17.262]  So just understand, when you see Dallas Buyers Club and what they do for COVID, yeah, they want you dead, folks.
[00:33:18.393 --> 00:33:19.793]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:19.873 --> 00:33:27.236]  Owen Schroyer is about to take over again in a moment, and he's got some special guests, a lot of news, and of course, your phone calls coming up here today.
[00:33:27.276 --> 00:33:32.017]  Really appreciate Owen sitting in and doing a fabulous job here on the Main Info Show.
[00:33:32.037 --> 00:33:35.778]  Of course, you can tune in to his extremely informative and powerful transmission.
[00:33:36.338 --> 00:33:38.100]  We are massively censored.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.401]  We are massively deplatformed.
[00:33:39.681 --> 00:33:46.040]   with Owen Schroer and another very important broadcast, Weekday Mornings with Harrison Smith, American Journal.
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:51.200]   Also has a lot of great guests and just amazing analysis by Harrison Smith.
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.641]  So please continue to spread the word about that.
[00:33:53.641 --> 00:33:55.401]  We are massively censored.
[00:33:55.401 --> 00:33:57.760]  We are massively deplatformed.
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:00.800]   But because of listeners and viewers with human intelligence,
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:05.161]   you've been able to overpower the censors in the last four years.
[00:34:05.161 --> 00:34:09.880]   And InfoWars has become the model and the standard of resistance and victory
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:12.119]  against the deep state of persevering.
[00:34:12.119 --> 00:34:16.481]   So thank you, and I mean that, from the bottom of my heart,
[00:34:16.481 --> 00:34:21.880]   for helping us all persevere together through what's happening.
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:26.760]   Now, I don't wanna talk about this subject, and I know listeners are sick of hearing about it,
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:33.079]   but it's very important to the big picture and to your life and to what the future
[00:34:33.079 --> 00:34:37.360]   of our country and the world is gonna be like we don't become aware of this.
[00:34:37.154 --> 00:34:42.178]  So sit back for a moment and think as you're tuning into the Alex Jones Show here today.
[00:34:45.741 --> 00:34:53.242]  Would you have to be living in a cave to not hear about Alex Jones every day in the news being demonized?
[00:34:54.744 --> 00:34:55.484]  Why is that happening?
[00:34:55.864 --> 00:34:56.724]  Why do they hate me so much?
[00:34:57.144 --> 00:35:12.047]  And why is their main tool of demonization against me, not that I'm a racist like they use on mainline Republicans and Conservatives, not, no, no, that I'm a horrible person because I ask questions about big events that start wars.
[00:35:12.827 --> 00:35:16.688]  I popularize the term false flag that's been around for hundreds of years.
[00:35:17.947 --> 00:35:22.427]  I get people to look at things closely and question.
[00:35:22.427 --> 00:35:24.746]  And that's why I'm the big bad wolf.
[00:35:24.746 --> 00:35:28.507]   If you look at what's happening in Ukraine, obviously the Russians are doing bad stuff.
[00:35:28.507 --> 00:35:30.706]  Obviously the Ukrainians are doing bad stuff.
[00:35:30.706 --> 00:35:31.547]  It's a war.
[00:35:31.547 --> 00:35:32.347]  It's terrible.
[00:35:32.347 --> 00:35:33.167]  It's horrible.
[00:35:33.167 --> 00:35:39.547]   But footage has poured out that's been proven to be fake by the Ukrainian side.
[00:35:39.547 --> 00:35:47.427]   We've not really caught the Russians doing any type of fake stunts or fake massacres.
[00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:52.251]  Because I think the Russians know that they're not sophisticated enough to get away with it.
[00:35:53.531 --> 00:35:58.013]  The Ukrainians have a very sophisticated movie propaganda system.
[00:35:58.593 --> 00:36:01.233]  Even mainstream media has talked about Zelensky's propaganda machine.
[00:36:01.273 --> 00:36:02.754]  He's been an actor all his life.
[00:36:04.389 --> 00:36:09.110]  And so they've been caught, though, staging all these fake massacres and these fake events.
[00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:14.271]  And now when you hear them talk, you don't know whether they're telling the truth or not.
[00:36:14.331 --> 00:36:20.672]  They have been caught using famous actors from Ukraine in battle scenes as victims over and over again.
[00:36:20.712 --> 00:36:32.434]  They've been caught using what's basically movie sets with Russian tanks they've captured to stage other events and claim that, oh, look, there's all these dead people on the street and they're actors, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:33.519 --> 00:36:34.200]  There's no blood.
[00:36:34.241 --> 00:36:35.142]  They're not even rotting.
[00:36:35.363 --> 00:36:36.765]  They've supposedly been dead there for weeks.
[00:36:38.439 --> 00:36:40.381]  We're not saying there aren't real people being killed.
[00:36:41.061 --> 00:36:44.083]  We're not saying this isn't really terrible that Putin invaded, in my view.
[00:36:45.925 --> 00:36:50.008]  But it's even worse that NATO started the fight to lure Russia in.
[00:36:50.348 --> 00:37:20.435]   What I'm saying is, it's our birthright and it's common sense to be able to question the Gulf of Tonkin, or question WMBs in Iraq, or question Anthrax and Colin Powell at the UN, and to question Jussie Smollett and Bubba Wallace and almost all these hate crimes against black people that turn out to be completely staged by leftists to again politically make everybody guilty and to follow their directive.
[00:37:20.495 --> 00:37:32.648]   So when you see in the news I mean, I can't even go to CNN's website without seeing articles every day demonizing me.
[00:37:33.008 --> 00:37:34.209]  You've got to ask why that is.
[00:37:35.049 --> 00:37:40.011]  Because they want everybody else out there to be scared to question events.
[00:37:40.992 --> 00:37:46.234]  They want everybody else out there to think that little people can't question official narratives.
[00:37:47.014 --> 00:37:48.875]  Going back to the case with Ukraine and Russia.
[00:37:50.134 --> 00:37:52.653]  I said that I thought Russia was probably going to invade.
[00:37:52.653 --> 00:37:56.574]   I also thought China was going to invade Taiwan because that information had been leaking
[00:37:56.574 --> 00:37:59.454]  out and the Chinese government said that they might do it.
[00:37:59.454 --> 00:38:05.052]   I think they're watching first, though, to see what Russia does.
[00:38:05.052 --> 00:38:12.534]   And I famously, of course, back in October of last year, made the prediction that by
[00:38:12.534 --> 00:38:14.652]  February that would happen.
[00:38:14.652 --> 00:38:20.373]   And then we saw Vladimir Putin lie and say that he wasn't going to invade while he was
[00:38:20.373 --> 00:38:21.574]  massing troops.
[00:38:21.574 --> 00:38:24.094]  Now, that's not him staging a false flag.
[00:38:24.094 --> 00:38:26.213]  That's not him staging dead bodies or massacres.
[00:38:26.213 --> 00:38:31.293]   But that's him lying and saying, I'm not going to invade, so that when he invaded, he had
[00:38:31.293 --> 00:38:32.454]  the element of surprise.
[00:38:32.454 --> 00:38:39.454]   Again, it's OK to question Putin and to say, I'm just not going to believe what he officially
[00:38:39.454 --> 00:38:40.454]  says.
[00:38:40.454 --> 00:38:46.492]   But we're told by the U.S. media, don't believe anything Putin says, but believe everything
[00:38:46.492 --> 00:38:53.373]   our media says when they have a much worse track record of Vladimir Putin when it comes
[00:38:54.231 --> 00:38:59.856]  So again, the most valuable thing we have is questioning narratives and not buying what we're officially told.
[00:39:00.871 --> 00:39:09.679]  Now we have Biden running around saying he wants war crimes, he wants escalated military hardware sent against Russia because of supposed massacres in this town.
[00:39:09.699 --> 00:39:15.644]  And we have articles on Infowars.com and the videos that clearly show a lot of this is fake.
[00:39:16.064 --> 00:39:17.445]  Plus, remember the ghost of Kiev?
[00:39:17.545 --> 00:39:18.066]  Wasn't real.
[00:39:18.346 --> 00:39:19.727]  Remember the Snake Island massacre?
[00:39:20.027 --> 00:39:20.528]  Wasn't real.
[00:39:21.128 --> 00:39:24.211]  And it's okay to point out that those are lies.
[00:39:25.352 --> 00:39:28.635]  Now, sometimes we're going to question events and they're going to turn out to be real.
[00:39:29.861 --> 00:39:31.101]  We've seen that with mass shootings.
[00:39:31.721 --> 00:39:35.242]  But it's okay and it's healthy to question those things.
[00:39:35.502 --> 00:39:46.885]  But that's why you see it all over the news that Alex Jones is the worst person on earth because the idea of someone questioning the establishment is the ultimate crime when it's the bedrock of freedom.
[00:39:47.265 --> 00:39:50.906]  The ability to say 2 plus 2 equals 4 is freedom.
[00:39:51.406 --> 00:39:54.767]  George Orwell was right when he wrote that and it's still true today.
[00:39:55.675 --> 00:40:12.856]  Everyone watching or listening to this broadcast today instinctively knows there's not hundreds of articles demonizing Alex Jones today and scores of TV programs on every major channel saying he's a horrible bad person because it's really all just about Alex Jones.
[00:40:13.036 --> 00:40:13.877]  It's about you.
[00:40:15.078 --> 00:40:17.720]  They want to demonize the common man, the common woman.
[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:19.521]  They want to demonize populist movements.
[00:40:20.362 --> 00:40:27.607]  And they see Infowars and our operation as the example of the folk hero, of the little guy standing up.
[00:40:28.227 --> 00:40:36.253]  And so they can take something I've done in my past, questioning a shooting here at Sandy Hook, exaggerate it, lie about it, and then demonize me.
[00:40:36.573 --> 00:40:38.614]  People don't even remember Adam Lanza's name.
[00:40:39.135 --> 00:40:45.980]   They remember Alex Jones, and they come up to me on the street and they say, you killed those kids or leave those kids alone.
[00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:51.723]  And then now the lawyers up here, Democratic Party lawyers are basically under the command of Senator Blumenthal.
[00:40:53.084 --> 00:41:01.430]  They are openly saying that, oh, we're going to show his shopping cart and how he made more money on Sandy Hook days.
[00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:03.852]  By the way, how are we defaulted?
[00:41:05.063 --> 00:41:21.560]  When we gave them all that, and then they say they have nothing, and now they want to double default where they have a trial where I'm guilty, already defaulted, a trial where you're already guilty, just deciding how guilty, and now a trial where we can't talk or put on evidence to show that they weren't damaged.
[00:41:22.381 --> 00:41:23.162]  You understand how that works?
[00:41:23.502 --> 00:41:31.792]  So, literal show trials at a level where the other side can't talk, where the defendants can't talk, and can't even defend themselves.
[00:41:32.392 --> 00:41:37.197]  Oh yes, you're guilty, but now you can't defend yourself on how you're not as guilty as they say you are.
[00:41:37.458 --> 00:41:38.679]  You're not this horrible villain.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:43.141]  They are stealing your birthright of a fair trial.
[00:41:43.201 --> 00:41:47.842]  They're destroying the Eighth Amendment against cruel and unusual punishment and excessive fines.
[00:41:48.202 --> 00:42:00.146]  They are raping everyone's birthright right now, and it is a triangle of a corrupt judiciary with a corrupt corporate media system and lawyers that are part of that whole triad of control.
[00:42:00.786 --> 00:42:09.017]  And this is a case point test example they admit on MSNBC and other channels to take Tucker Carlson and everybody else off air.
[00:42:09.358 --> 00:42:15.466]  The idea that you sell products and that you're lying on air to sell the products is absolutely insane.
[00:42:16.593 --> 00:42:17.794]  You tell the truth on air.
[00:42:17.954 --> 00:42:19.055]  People know you tell the truth.
[00:42:19.095 --> 00:42:19.896]  You have a big audience.
[00:42:20.236 --> 00:42:22.738]  Then you sell products that people want and need.
[00:42:23.119 --> 00:42:24.660]  That's a totally separate deal.
[00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:27.582]  I am talk radio on TV.
[00:42:27.943 --> 00:42:28.623]  That's our model.
[00:42:29.304 --> 00:42:42.194]   But again, they're selling the idea that when anybody that's populist or anybody that's conservative or Christian Has their own outlet, has their own economy, has their own listeners and their own financial ecosystem, that that's the ultimate sin.
[00:42:42.675 --> 00:42:48.737]  And that came out in Clinton documents a few years ago when the Western Journalism Center sued and got them out of their federal papers.
[00:42:49.797 --> 00:42:57.180]  It was the Clintons when they first got elected in 93 saying our main mission is shutting down conservative ecosystems that are selling VHS tapes and books.
[00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:04.102]  We've got to silence them or they're going to form their own ecosystem and their own economy and then the populace will take America back.
[00:43:04.602 --> 00:43:05.423]  And that's what this is.
[00:43:05.503 --> 00:43:19.233]  These are globalist dictators, World Economic Forum tyrants that have penetrated our governments, put their people into control, and now they don't want a peaceful political uprising of the populace that question them and remove them.
[00:43:19.434 --> 00:43:19.954]  Well, guess what?
[00:43:20.014 --> 00:43:30.242]  They failed, and we're never going to be silenced, and the people are awakening, and humanity will come together, and we will have peace, and we will have justice, and we will bring the criminals to justice.
[00:43:30.362 --> 00:43:31.263]  God bless and good luck.
[00:43:31.343 --> 00:43:38.343]  Hour number two coming up.
[00:43:38.343 --> 00:43:50.143]   I want to thank folks that got part one in the three-part Founders Series at 1776coin.com
[00:43:50.143 --> 00:43:52.062]  or infullrestore.com.
[00:43:52.026 --> 00:43:54.108]  And the second installment is the Tree of Liberty.
[00:43:54.528 --> 00:43:58.090]  Thomas Jefferson quote, must be watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[00:43:58.351 --> 00:43:59.251]  It's a coin I designed.
[00:43:59.271 --> 00:44:00.172]  I'm very, very proud of it.
[00:44:00.552 --> 00:44:02.594]  And it will end up being a collectible.
[00:44:03.194 --> 00:44:08.638]  I know that the first coin is already selling on eBay and other places for three times what we sold it.
[00:44:09.358 --> 00:44:16.042]  We need to sell all 10,000 of these very, very quickly, and I appreciate listeners getting over half of them now.
[00:44:16.182 --> 00:44:18.183]  I'd like to move them out very quickly.
[00:44:18.203 --> 00:44:21.125]  I think they will sell out probably in five or six more days.
[00:44:21.805 --> 00:44:26.348]  And without the last coin sale, we would not be operating at the same capacity.
[00:44:26.368 --> 00:44:28.529]  We would have had to lay off a lot of people, and that's a big problem.
[00:44:28.569 --> 00:44:30.070]  So it's a limited edition, collectible.
[00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:36.933]  Now you can't say with 100% certainty that if the election wasn't stolen from Donald Trump and the American people in 2020 that the situation in Ukraine wouldn't be happening.
[00:44:36.753 --> 00:44:42.592]  and us aid in the fight against the new world order at 1776coin.com.
[00:44:42.592 --> 00:44:50.512]   Now you can't say with 100% certainty that if the election wasn't stolen from Donald
[00:44:50.512 --> 00:44:54.972]   Trump and the American people in 2020 that the situation in Ukraine wouldn't be happening.
[00:44:54.972 --> 00:45:04.753]   But what we can say with 100% certainty is that the last two times Biden has been in
[00:45:04.753 --> 00:45:09.792]  the White House, Russia has invaded Ukraine.
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:10.780]  That is a fact.
[00:45:11.801 --> 00:45:31.539]   Now remember, when they first started peddling the fake PPgate dossier, the Hillary Clinton paid for opposition research fake PP dossier, the claim at the time was that Russia had blackmail on Trump.
[00:45:33.641 --> 00:45:37.545]  Russia was controlling Trump because of said blackmail.
[00:45:39.106 --> 00:45:44.051]  And the blackmail was the alleged PPGate, Trump dossier.
[00:45:45.185 --> 00:45:46.986]  Which was all made up.
[00:45:47.106 --> 00:45:52.330]  In fact, it may have actually been actually a Hunter Biden story that they just said was Trump instead.
[00:45:52.971 --> 00:46:04.200]  Probably, maybe the case, folks, that it was actually a Hunter Biden or Joe Biden story that they just did a Indiana Jones switch and just put Trump's name in it instead.
[00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:07.662]  That it was going to be used to get Biden out of the race.
[00:46:09.110 --> 00:46:18.753]  And it was actually the New York Times that was reporting that Hillary Clinton had dirt on Biden that the Clinton campaign was going to release that was going to cause Biden to drop out of the race.
[00:46:18.793 --> 00:46:26.215]  Well, he dropped out, they never released it, then all of a sudden the PPGate Trump dossier came out, which was totally fake, we now know it.
[00:46:27.395 --> 00:46:35.538]  So, the last two times Biden's been in the White House, Russia has invaded Ukraine, that is undeniable.
[00:46:36.789 --> 00:46:40.511]  Now again, can I say with confidence that if Trump was in the White House it wouldn't happen?
[00:46:40.591 --> 00:46:42.012]  Well, I can say that with confidence.
[00:46:42.732 --> 00:46:43.853]  Is it 100% certain?
[00:46:43.893 --> 00:46:47.255]  Maybe not 100% certain, but it's about as close as you can get.
[00:46:49.596 --> 00:46:50.477]  Now why do I say that?
[00:46:50.597 --> 00:46:56.680]  Well, why doesn't Democrat-Liberal logic ever get applied equally?
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:58.321]  Because it's not logic.
[00:46:58.841 --> 00:46:59.882]  It's propaganda.
[00:47:01.383 --> 00:47:10.193]   So if said tape existed against Donald Trump, That would cause Trump to be compromised by the Russians.
[00:47:10.893 --> 00:47:13.754]  Well then what does Hunter Biden's laptop equal?
[00:47:15.495 --> 00:47:15.595]  Ah.
[00:47:16.835 --> 00:47:16.895]  Ah.
[00:47:18.596 --> 00:47:46.488]   Now it would be very reasonable to assume Not just the Hunter Biden laptop that we've seen or that we know about, then there's the second Hunter Biden laptop that got stolen from him by Russian or Ukrainian drug dealers, where we have a phone conversation that leaked of Hunter Biden saying he was concerned because these drug dealers in Ukraine, maybe they're Russian, maybe they're Ukraine, stole one of his laptops that had sensitive information on it.
[00:47:47.438 --> 00:47:52.180]  And after what we've seen from the laptop, I think we have an idea what kind of sensitive information that is.
[00:47:52.921 --> 00:48:04.786]  So who's to say, given the Democrat-Liberal logic from 2015 and 2016, who's to say that Biden is not the one being controlled by Russia right now?
[00:48:05.427 --> 00:48:15.572]   And if you look at how the geopolitical picture has changed since Biden has been in office, Well, it really shakes out with that logic, doesn't it?
[00:48:16.432 --> 00:48:19.054]  Russia has never been more relevant as a world power.
[00:48:20.375 --> 00:48:27.300]  Russia has never been thrust to the top of the geopolitical power structure in such a short time as they have since Biden got into office.
[00:48:28.681 --> 00:48:39.750]  And now we're looking at a situation where gas, natural gas transactions are going to be made in rupees and not the US dollar?
[00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:43.723]  And we're just looking around the corner at that being the future?
[00:48:46.325 --> 00:49:06.463]  So please, to all the Democrats and the Libs and the media out there that said Trump was going to be compromised and controlled by Russia for the PPGate dossier, which we now know is fake, tell me where is your logic, where is your fair and balanced coverage, using that same conclusion towards the Hunter Biden laptop story?
[00:49:07.705 --> 00:49:12.087]  Oh, see, it doesn't exist because you're liars, you're frauds, you're phonies.
[00:49:13.428 --> 00:49:27.215]  Now, we're going to get into the latest situation in Ukraine with my guest coming up, independent journalist Jacob Creech, who's been breaking a lot of news when it comes to the bio labs, the Russian strikes on the bio labs, and the Biden involvement in the bio labs.
[00:49:28.095 --> 00:49:41.842]   Boy, you know, all you liberal Democrats out there that want to stop the war in Ukraine, Well, you could have done that by stopping Biden from getting into office, but you let him steal the election, and so now you're dealing with the consequences.
[00:49:43.783 --> 00:49:45.383]  You know, it's just so outrageous.
[00:49:47.564 --> 00:49:50.865]  I'm watching... I don't even know what I was watching last night.
[00:49:50.885 --> 00:50:00.968]  I was watching something on television, non-political, maybe sports or like a movie or TV show or something, and I don't...
[00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:22.686]   Usually it's just full-on news on my TVs all day but I'm just I'm sick of looking at the left destroying America 24-7 so I've been trying to just divert my attention with sports and comedy and stuff and then it's little pictures or pictures of little kids in Ukraine And this is like on all the networks.
[00:50:22.706 --> 00:50:30.730]  It's like Comedy Central, ESPN, ABC, who's ever broadcasting the men's college basketball tournament.
[00:50:31.011 --> 00:50:32.111]  And I see the same stuff.
[00:50:32.912 --> 00:50:40.236]  All these different groups that would raise money for Africa, raise money for Jews, or raise money for this and raise money for that.
[00:50:40.796 --> 00:50:42.997]  All of them are now raising money for Ukraine.
[00:50:44.098 --> 00:50:46.640]  And they're all showing you the plight of the Ukrainian people.
[00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:50.562]  And then they have pictures of little Ukrainian kids up there.
[00:50:51.906 --> 00:50:56.032]  You know, saying they're starving, they need your help, they need your money, they need your support.
[00:50:57.995 --> 00:51:01.200]  And I'm just sitting there and I'm just watching this and it's just stunning!
[00:51:02.332 --> 00:51:09.916]  When you, when you've put on the glasses, when you've put on, or when you've taken the red pill and you see this stuff, it just, it hits so much different.
[00:51:10.717 --> 00:51:20.262]  And you realize most of the people probably watching this, tuned in to watch a comedy event or tuned in to watch a college basketball game, have no clue what's going on.
[00:51:20.542 --> 00:51:25.665]  And they just see this propaganda and it's just like, oh wow, really bad in Ukraine, wow.
[00:51:25.685 --> 00:51:29.287]  You know, maybe they give a little money, maybe just the propaganda hits home.
[00:51:31.596 --> 00:51:37.439]  But it's just, you sit there and you look back at it, and you're like, wow.
[00:51:38.239 --> 00:51:43.902]  These organizations have been running these scams, yes, scams, for years.
[00:51:45.243 --> 00:51:45.923]  That's all it is.
[00:51:45.943 --> 00:51:50.386]  And again, it's like the same thing with the hospital.
[00:51:50.866 --> 00:51:53.247]  I don't want to come on air and be anti-hospital.
[00:51:53.267 --> 00:51:54.668]  I don't want to be anti-doctor.
[00:51:54.708 --> 00:51:56.149]  That's like the last thing I want to be.
[00:51:58.376 --> 00:51:59.477]  I'm gonna tell it like it is.
[00:52:00.338 --> 00:52:03.400]  You get COVID, you go to the hospital, you're asking to die.
[00:52:06.082 --> 00:52:08.785]  You got one of these doctors promoting the death shot?
[00:52:09.846 --> 00:52:11.747]  Yeah, I'd avoid that doctor.
[00:52:11.987 --> 00:52:13.068]  I'd avoid that hospital.
[00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:17.932]  Does that make me feel good that I'm telling you you can't trust our health institutions?
[00:52:18.273 --> 00:52:19.554]  No, that sucks.
[00:52:21.547 --> 00:52:35.359]  So it's the same thing with all these charities that just pop up and the latest cause, the latest craze, the latest trend, they fundraise for it and you know the only reason they do that is because they're making millions and millions of dollars.
[00:52:38.002 --> 00:52:43.787]  Because think about it, why would they pay millions of dollars for advertising unless they were set to make millions of dollars?
[00:52:45.185 --> 00:52:51.472]  And they've already come out with all these group CEOs like the Red Cross and what's the other big one?
[00:52:51.952 --> 00:52:53.133]  It's like Gateway or something.
[00:52:53.153 --> 00:52:54.294]  They sponsor the NFL.
[00:52:55.175 --> 00:52:55.936]  They've already come out.
[00:52:55.976 --> 00:52:57.518]  They're all making buku dollars.
[00:52:57.558 --> 00:52:59.880]  The CEOs, all of them making millions of dollars.
[00:53:00.201 --> 00:53:04.205]  Tiny, tiny fraction of your donation, like 10% actually goes to the cause.
[00:53:07.526 --> 00:53:24.695]  And it's just scam, after scam, after scam, and I'm just sitting here, like, I'm trying to watch a basketball game, and I'm getting, boom, COVID propaganda, boom, gay propaganda, boom, Ukraine propaganda, and this is just all in a two, three minute break!
[00:53:28.617 --> 00:53:42.218]   And it just sucks, like, just the propaganda is everywhere, and you have to fully remove yourself from the establishment, from the corporate establishment, You have to fully remove yourself, otherwise you're just sitting there consuming this propaganda all day long.
[00:53:42.578 --> 00:53:55.246]  And that's the problem is, most people here are just tuning in to watch a ballgame, and they have no clue, they are just getting bombarded with propaganda the entire time.
[00:53:56.528 --> 00:54:02.570]  Even when the game's on, with all the Black Lives Matter stuff, people wearing blue and yellow for Ukraine, I mean, this is during the game.
[00:54:03.291 --> 00:54:07.272]  Then you go to the break, and again, it's, you're gay, your kids are gay, everyone's gay!
[00:54:07.952 --> 00:54:09.273]  Give money to Ukraine!
[00:54:10.213 --> 00:54:11.514]  It's just, it's non-stop with it.
[00:54:15.785 --> 00:54:17.886]  So we've got Jacob Creech on air with us.
[00:54:17.906 --> 00:54:19.047]  He's an independent journalist.
[00:54:19.067 --> 00:54:30.233]  He's been the tip of the spear on many of the breaking stories revolving around the biolabs in Ukraine, the Biden involvement, and the Russian attacks on said biolabs.
[00:54:30.273 --> 00:54:31.973]  So I bring Jacob in now.
[00:54:32.494 --> 00:54:34.615]  Jacob, just what is the beginner's course for this?
[00:54:34.655 --> 00:54:42.239]  What is kind of the introductory course to the biolabs in Ukraine, the Biden involvement, and the Russian assault on them?
[00:54:44.447 --> 00:54:46.048]  Yes, Owen, thanks for having me on.
[00:54:46.868 --> 00:54:48.969]  Kind of for starters, the U.S.
[00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:57.693]  DOD does have a biological threat reduction program in Ukraine with which they try to cover up excessively.
[00:54:58.213 --> 00:55:02.615]  Once I started kind of breaking the news, I wasn't the first one to know about bio labs in Ukraine.
[00:55:02.635 --> 00:55:23.477]   I was the first one to make the connection that the Ukrainians, or excuse me, the Russians were moving into Ukraine to attack and or take over these bio labs due to the fact that they have been accusing the United States of creating biological weapons and doing dangerous research on pathogens in these labs in Ukraine.
[00:55:24.258 --> 00:55:56.225]   So I was kind of censored and heavily attacked for bringing all this information to the forefront and since since then all the information has come out to support everything that I have been pushing with which the Russians are moving into Ukraine to attack Now, what is the involvement with Rosemont, Seneca, or one of these other Biden shell corporations that they launder money out of?
[00:55:56.665 --> 00:55:57.846]  What's the involvement there?
[00:55:59.567 --> 00:56:05.789]  Yes, so this information was brought forth actually from the Russian military to the United Nations.
[00:56:06.701 --> 00:56:16.855]  It was presented that there was connections between Hunter Biden, the DNC, via his investment firm, Rosemont Seneca, to funnel U.S.
[00:56:16.895 --> 00:56:23.705]  DoD funds into one of their own biolabs that they own in Ukraine, known as a metabiota.
[00:56:24.924 --> 00:56:36.417]  And there's so much more digging to be done in that situation, what research MetaBiota is digging into and creating genome-specific pathogens to attack nationalities and races.
[00:56:36.597 --> 00:56:39.521]  So you can understand why Russia might be a little bit upset about that.
[00:56:40.162 --> 00:56:49.384]   But yes, Hunter Biden and the Kerry family, as well as the Pelosi family and the Romney family, all have family members sitting on the board of Rosemount Seneca
[00:56:49.384 --> 00:56:56.014]   involved in this funneling of US funds into US biolabs in Ukraine. I want to
[00:56:56.014 --> 00:57:01.695]   get back to those names but I want to know if you've noticed this pattern too
[00:57:01.695 --> 00:57:05.695]   and if there's if there's something significant about this.
[00:57:04.574 --> 00:57:14.978]  Why was Barack Obama so intent on having all these biolabs weapons going, or biolabs going, whether he knew they were for weapons or not?
[00:57:14.998 --> 00:57:16.639]  I guess you could say he didn't know.
[00:57:17.799 --> 00:57:23.824]  It was Obama that made sure when the lab in North Carolina was shut down that all that research got sent to the Wuhan lab in China.
[00:57:24.245 --> 00:57:32.492]  It was one of the last things they did in the Obama administration to make sure that there was more funding into Ukraine, not just for neo-Nazis, but for these bio labs.
[00:57:33.012 --> 00:57:34.614]  What is the Obama connection with that?
[00:57:34.694 --> 00:57:37.757]  Is it significant or is that just something he happened to be there and oversee?
[00:57:40.367 --> 00:57:52.891]  Well, I would definitely say that it's significant, given the fact that in 2005, Obama, along with one other senator, was sent to Ukraine to observe and emplace the Biological Threat Reduction Program.
[00:57:54.752 --> 00:57:56.012]  So there's definitely a connection there.
[00:57:56.513 --> 00:58:10.619]   And the fact that they made sure to do this on Obama's way out was kind of sketchy in the sense that the deep state was utilizing these locations in Ukraine to circumvent U.S.
[00:58:10.659 --> 00:58:21.061]  congressional oversight to conduct their black site activities and create pathogens with increased lethality and transmissibility.
[00:58:21.582 --> 00:58:29.203]  So, I would definitely say there's a connection there, you know, given the deep state and the activity and Obama being smack dab in the middle of all of this.
[00:58:29.743 --> 00:58:40.956]   He most certainly played a part in creating and generating this opportunity for the deep state to create These pathogens, like I said, outside of the scope of U.S.
[00:58:40.976 --> 00:58:41.776]  congressional oversight.
[00:58:43.517 --> 00:58:45.198]  So yeah, there's definitely a connection there.
[00:58:45.319 --> 00:58:53.824]  I can't necessarily confirm any direct involvement like I can with the Hunter Biden, Pelosi's, Kerry's, and Romney's.
[00:58:54.044 --> 00:58:55.985]  So let's pick it up there on the other side of this break.
[00:58:57.246 --> 00:59:00.147]  Investigative journalist Jacob Creech is with us.
[00:59:00.187 --> 00:59:03.429]  We're talking about the biolabs in Ukraine.
[00:59:04.890 --> 00:59:16.410]   And really, Jacob, I think that If we understand this story, we understand so much of the geopolitical corruption, specifically that the American government officials are involved in.
[00:59:16.450 --> 00:59:22.837]  We know that there's corruption all over the planet, but we've got to clean up our own front yard first before we point fingers at others.
[00:59:24.431 --> 00:59:28.216]  We were discussing the clear Obama involvement of all this.
[00:59:28.276 --> 00:59:35.305]  I mean, literally, from the time he got into the Senate in the early 2000s to the time he left the White House in 2016, he was all over biolabs.
[00:59:35.685 --> 00:59:37.147]  In Ukraine, China, everything.
[00:59:37.267 --> 00:59:40.892]  But was he directly involved, or were these just projects he was overseeing?
[00:59:42.213 --> 00:59:48.379]  You could have the debate, but with Pelosi, Romney, Kerry, Biden and their family members, there is direct involvement.
[00:59:48.659 --> 00:59:49.580]  There are receipts.
[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:50.601]  It's all on paper.
[00:59:50.661 --> 00:59:51.722]  The media won't cover it.
[00:59:52.022 --> 00:59:59.689]  So let's talk about that and how this really shows the overall geopolitical corruption that our politicians are involved in.
[01:00:01.576 --> 01:00:02.236]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:00:02.276 --> 01:00:21.923]  So what's really going on here is these these major political families are utilizing their family members as proxies to carry out their black site operations to, like I said, circumvent oversight from their constitutional bodies with which are supposed to govern these activities.
[01:00:22.103 --> 01:00:28.966]  So, for example, the reason why we do this research in Ukraine is because it's illegal here in the United States.
[01:00:29.688 --> 01:00:36.271]  And it's also much easier to cover up these kinds of things if they're taking place in Ukraine as opposed to the U.S.
[01:00:36.571 --> 01:00:49.097]  So these families are utilizing their own investment firms and their own biological research facilities, which why do politicians own biological research facilities in other countries, let alone our own countries?
[01:00:49.477 --> 01:00:50.258]  What the hell are they doing?
[01:00:51.298 --> 01:00:57.108]   If you are willing to believe that it's Benevolent in any manner than you're ignorant.
[01:00:57.288 --> 01:00:58.469]  It's 100% nefarious.
[01:00:58.509 --> 01:01:05.555]  There's no reason why they would want to do this other than to get their hands into something with which they could use to enact control on the population.
[01:01:05.676 --> 01:01:07.177]  So yes, our U.S.
[01:01:07.217 --> 01:01:44.831]   politicians are utilizing corrupt methods, quasi-legal and legal methods, to create pathogens to attack certain nationalities and genome-specific sequences And the Russians found out about it, the Russians went to war for it, the Russians moved into Ukraine for it, and the media and the left-wing media complex has gone to extreme lengths to cover this up, with which has now been proven to be 100% true, to include Victoria Nuland confirming about these biolabs in Ukraine and being concerned about the Russians getting their hands on the information and the research they were conducting.
[01:01:45.431 --> 01:01:47.112]  Of course, that was Nuland confirming that.
[01:01:48.132 --> 01:01:52.714]  In Congress, under oath, while Jen Psaki was saying that they don't exist in the same hour.
[01:01:53.415 --> 01:01:54.835]  So that just shows how they lie to us.
[01:01:55.296 --> 01:02:02.759]  But I am curious, I mean, what is the motive here for the Pelosi's, the Romney's, the Kerry's, the Biden's to get involved in these labs?
[01:02:02.779 --> 01:02:05.841]  I mean, the obvious reason would be money.
[01:02:06.481 --> 01:02:10.183]  But, I mean, is there some sort of anti-Russian sentiment that they carry?
[01:02:10.263 --> 01:02:12.564]  I mean, are they making a bunch of money?
[01:02:12.584 --> 01:02:14.265]  I mean, what's their real motive here, do you think?
[01:02:16.687 --> 01:02:29.075]  Well, now you're asking me to imply intent, which I can't prove and legally can get me into trouble, but I can infer as to what I think is going on, and I don't really care if they seek legal action against me, bring it on.
[01:02:30.115 --> 01:02:46.172]   These people are, well, let's start with the reason why Russia is mad about it, is because the Russians have put forth information showing that we were conducting research Specifically asking for DNA and mRNA samples of white Russians.
[01:02:46.773 --> 01:03:03.745]  So the Russians believe that we are creating biological weapons specifically designed to target their people with which is why Putin came on and said that he had to invade Ukraine to neutralize a threat with which was a threat to his population and his people.
[01:03:05.755 --> 01:03:07.196]  So is it just about money?
[01:03:07.216 --> 01:03:09.037]  I really don't believe so.
[01:03:09.077 --> 01:03:15.462]  There's so many other avenues with which these people just destroy and utilize our U.S.
[01:03:15.502 --> 01:03:23.768]  taxpayer dollars as their slush fund to enrich themselves, which they can do that strictly just from their inside trading.
[01:03:25.194 --> 01:03:28.858]  They don't necessarily need to have biolabs in Ukraine just for money.
[01:03:29.258 --> 01:03:29.999]  It's nefarious.
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:40.190]  And given the fact that COVID just happened, and given the fact that they're now admitting that it came from a lab, it's pretty cut and dry as to what's happening here.
[01:03:40.290 --> 01:03:41.792]  And if you can't see it, I can't help you.
[01:03:42.232 --> 01:03:46.797]  But there are corrupt politicians creating pathogens, and they're getting out.
[01:03:48.036 --> 01:03:48.736]  And ruining the world.
[01:03:48.876 --> 01:03:50.817]  Yeah, and you just said it right there.
[01:03:51.177 --> 01:03:52.938]  It's pretty obvious what's going on.
[01:03:53.018 --> 01:04:02.522]  Any neutral observer seeing this can say, whether you like Russia, hate Russia, think Russia's the good guy or the bad guy, you cannot deny these biolabs were there.
[01:04:03.022 --> 01:04:05.063]  You cannot deny that that's a dangerous threat.
[01:04:05.083 --> 01:04:06.943]  There's a reason why they shut them down in America.
[01:04:07.284 --> 01:04:12.045]  You cannot deny that it was a similar biolab that caused the COVID outbreak, whether you think it was intentional or not.
[01:04:13.066 --> 01:04:22.438]   So I guess then the next question is, For these individuals getting involved in this, I mean, is there some sort of agreement?
[01:04:22.478 --> 01:04:24.441]  Like, hey, we have to be anti-Russia?
[01:04:24.541 --> 01:04:26.143]  Is it a protection against Russia?
[01:04:26.263 --> 01:04:33.491]  Or I guess the better question is this, because we don't know their motives, how about the media's motive?
[01:04:33.791 --> 01:04:36.774]  Why is the media so interested in covering this information up?
[01:04:37.537 --> 01:04:39.216]  They fall for fake news all the time.
[01:04:39.216 --> 01:04:43.817]   They give themselves awards for covering fake news, like the Trump-Russian collusion or dossier,
[01:04:43.817 --> 01:04:44.657]  which never happened.
[01:04:44.657 --> 01:04:46.177]  They give themselves awards for that.
[01:04:46.177 --> 01:04:49.777]  Why the blatant cover-up of this story, do you think?
[01:04:49.777 --> 01:04:58.376]   Well, 100% I can confirm as to why this is, is because the realization that we are conducting
[01:04:58.376 --> 01:05:03.457]   nefarious and/or questionable research in different countries and biolabs across the world
[01:05:03.457 --> 01:05:09.376]   will eventually lead us to the confirmation that the US NIH created COVID
[01:05:09.376 --> 01:05:12.737]  and either let it out or it escaped.
[01:05:13.193 --> 01:05:14.814]  You're welcome to believe whichever one you like.
[01:05:15.115 --> 01:05:17.096]  I believe it's quite obvious as to which one that is.
[01:05:19.568 --> 01:05:28.470]  So the reason why they're covering up is because as soon as we get back to the fact that they created COVID, the entire narrative of everything they've been covering for years completely collapses.
[01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:32.111]  They tried to cover up the fact that COVID came from a lab in Wuhan.
[01:05:32.131 --> 01:05:48.395]  They said it came from a bat and some peasant eating bat soup, which leads to all the other crimes they committed, such as covering up viable treatments for the bioweapon they released in order to enable emergency use authorization for their vaccines.
[01:05:49.275 --> 01:05:53.856]  That didn't work and were neither safe nor effective.
[01:05:55.877 --> 01:06:08.961]  And it leads back to the fact that they infringed on the 1972 Bioweapons Convention, which is agreed upon by all but four nations in the world, with which you cannot stockpile or create biological weapons.
[01:06:09.361 --> 01:06:33.296]   So the reason why the media is so hell-bent on covering all this up and making sure that everything is pushed pro-Ukraine, the reason why they May the entire country support a literal Nazi military installation in Ukraine just because it's not the Russians, is all to cover up the fact that they created COVID, they let it out, and they utilized it to implement a medical police state on the entire world.
[01:06:34.346 --> 01:06:36.547]  Jacob Creech is our guest.
[01:06:36.867 --> 01:06:43.289]  Bioclandestine.substack.com is where you can follow his great news coverage.
[01:06:43.329 --> 01:07:03.081]   He's been on this since day one, folks, and when we come back from this break, Jacob, I want to get into more of what's going on in Ukraine, because my biggest problem is, I want to know how you deal with this, my biggest problem is, whenever I go and I try to look for the latest news coming out of Ukraine, It's literally two sides to every story.
[01:07:03.422 --> 01:07:05.223]  Oh, that's Russians torturing Ukrainians.
[01:07:05.303 --> 01:07:07.064]  No, that's Ukrainians torturing Russians.
[01:07:07.084 --> 01:07:09.827]  I mean, it's the same video, two completely separate takes.
[01:07:10.207 --> 01:07:16.312]  So my question for you when we come back, Jacob, is how do you differentiate what's real and what's fake?
[01:07:16.352 --> 01:07:20.135]  How do you differentiate if it's a Ukrainian army or a Russian army?
[01:07:20.776 --> 01:07:26.660]  Or do you just kind of say, hey, look, there's no way for me to be completely positive, so I'm just going to cover what I know for fact?
[01:07:27.201 --> 01:07:29.723]  Jacob Creech, coming back on the other side of this break.
[01:07:31.032 --> 01:07:45.437]  We've got one more segment here with Jacob Creech, and you know, I've seen the American media's wag the dog technique for years now, and it's very apparent with the Ukraine situation.
[01:07:45.817 --> 01:07:48.438]  The media sets a narrative, the brainwashed public goes along with it.
[01:07:49.972 --> 01:08:02.716]  I don't want to be on the opposite side of that, but yet still being in a wag the dog situation where whenever I see the mainstream media or the American media covering something or forcing a talking point or a narrative, I just assume it's fake.
[01:08:02.836 --> 01:08:09.639]  Because in a way, that's me being wagged by the dog as well, even if that is probably the best way to approach the situation.
[01:08:10.479 --> 01:08:21.198]   But Jacob, I'm sure you're having the same problems or rather frustrations that I'm having where There's videos, there's reports, there's all this stuff, and it's literally two sides to every story.
[01:08:21.438 --> 01:08:23.559]  Hey, that's Russians torturing Ukrainians.
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:25.521]  Hey, that's Ukrainians torturing Russians.
[01:08:25.761 --> 01:08:27.322]  Same video, two different stories.
[01:08:28.123 --> 01:08:38.531]  So how do you try to sort through all the propaganda, all the wag the dog, to try to find out what's really going on in Ukraine with all the headlines and the videos coming out?
[01:08:38.731 --> 01:08:42.234]  What's your technique or what advice do you give to people that are trying to follow this story?
[01:08:44.662 --> 01:08:57.651]  Well, for starters, I definitely agree with your sentiment with if it's coming from the mainstream media in the Western media complex, there's a good chance based on recent proof that they are lying.
[01:08:57.791 --> 01:09:05.536]  So that's the reason why I started looking into the bio lab situation in Ukraine was because during the initial airstrikes, I figured this out within about three hours.
[01:09:06.666 --> 01:09:12.105]   was they were pushing that it was all from from Donetsk and Crimea in the east yet there were
[01:09:12.105 --> 01:09:18.746]   random individuals, airstrikes going on in locations all the way in Lviv in the west
[01:09:18.746 --> 01:09:23.786]   and Kiev in the capital so immediately I knew what they were telling me wasn't right and that
[01:09:23.786 --> 01:09:29.945]   carries on with all these videos and such. You can go back to the Snake Island and the Ghost of
[01:09:29.945 --> 01:09:35.065]   Kiev and all the nonsense stories the bombing of the maternity ward which wasn't true and was
[01:09:35.065 --> 01:09:41.385]   actually overtaken by Nazis utilizing that as a forward operating base but
[01:09:41.378 --> 01:09:46.177]   The way I go about it is, is I know for a fact if it's coming from the TV is a good chance that it's a lie.
[01:09:46.177 --> 01:09:49.177]   So I have to compile all the facts that I can to the best of my knowledge.
[01:09:49.177 --> 01:09:53.878]   When it comes to interpreting the videos and such, to be quite frank, I don't pay attention to any of those videos.
[01:09:53.878 --> 01:09:58.378]   It's so easy to stage those, easy to stage fake bodies, chemical attacks,
[01:09:58.378 --> 01:10:06.577]   like the actor that got caught in the gas explosion that they tried to push is also being bombed by Putin.
[01:10:06.577 --> 01:10:14.378]   It's just impossible to confirm any of that, so I only deal with the facts that I can verify via documentation,
[01:10:14.378 --> 01:10:21.777]   like I did with the Ukrainian bio labs as I found the source material on the USGov sites.
[01:10:21.876 --> 01:10:35.007]  So, I just find stuff that I can prove and verify, but when it comes to videos and stuff going on in Ukraine, you have to have a discerning eye and understand that we really don't know what's going on over there, and it is a propaganda war, U.S.
[01:10:35.027 --> 01:10:40.612]  versus Russia, and to be quite frank, I don't know who to believe, who I should believe, or why I should believe either side.
[01:10:41.676 --> 01:10:58.327]  Well said, and an example would be the most recent video that I'm seeing all over the news, Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, they're all playing the same one, where it's an individual with a camera walking down the street, and there's a dead body here, a dead body there, and I mean, they zoom in.
[01:10:58.347 --> 01:11:03.791]  It's like, they show you the body, they zoom into the blood, I mean, it's like, so clearly there's a narrative they're trying to push there.
[01:11:04.631 --> 01:11:12.553]  And again, it's like, I don't want to be the one that just doubts everything I see on TV at the risk of being considered a lunatic, but again, it's the same problem.
[01:11:12.573 --> 01:11:14.514]  It's like, I know they've staged videos.
[01:11:14.534 --> 01:11:25.197]  We've seen them stage videos in Syria and other places where they have people in body bags and they start moving around or they sneeze during the film and it's like, oh hey, we gotta reshoot this fake dead guy scene.
[01:11:25.997 --> 01:11:32.507]  Uh, or like videos where they show Ukrainians supposedly doing mind sweeps, and the cameraman is in front of the guy doing it.
[01:11:32.887 --> 01:11:38.435]  So he's, what, he's gonna get blown up and that's your... So I mean, there's obvious stuff that you can tell is fake, then there's other stuff that's nuanced.
[01:11:38.855 --> 01:11:40.938]  But I guess my question is this, because...
[01:11:42.119 --> 01:11:57.365]  It was not too long ago, 10, 20 years ago, whether it's the babies and incubator moment or all this other stuff where when the American media would show something like a bunch of dead bodies on the streets in Ukraine, all of America would jump and say, this is awful, we have to do something about this.
[01:11:58.065 --> 01:12:00.426]  It seems to me America's less sensitive to this now.
[01:12:00.566 --> 01:12:09.230]  Specifically, let's say the Fox News audience, for obvious reasons, most Fox News audiences don't even trust Fox News, but they just at least consider it more fair and balanced than anything else they're going to see.
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:15.982]  Where usually they would show all these videos of dead people and it'd be like, knee-jerk, we're going to war.
[01:12:16.662 --> 01:12:19.943]  It doesn't seem to have the impact that it's had in years past.
[01:12:19.983 --> 01:12:20.784]  Would you agree with that?
[01:12:22.444 --> 01:12:29.847]  Yeah, that's an excellent point and that just goes to prove that now more than ever there is less trust in the media than there has ever been.
[01:12:30.147 --> 01:12:43.870]   And that is due to the fact that we as an intelligence, a citizen intelligence apparatus, have Massively expanded in our reach and our ability to provide a counter-narrative to just the absolute nonsense that they've been pushing us for years.
[01:12:44.510 --> 01:13:00.134]   So I give credit to this to social media and the fact that we have a voice even despite all of the censorship and de-platforming we're still able to get this message out and now more than ever People are listening to citizens as opposed to what's coming through the news.
[01:13:00.175 --> 01:13:06.023]  So yes, I agree with you 100% that the people, to be quite frank, I don't know if I'm allowed to curse in your show, we're not buying the BS anymore.
[01:13:06.344 --> 01:13:11.211]  We're just not buying it and we're going to figure it out on our own and we're not listening to a single word anyone's got to say about it.
[01:13:12.321 --> 01:13:18.163]  I'm hearing mixed conclusions just from going through the waterfront of media.
[01:13:18.643 --> 01:13:19.943]  I'm hearing mixed conclusions.
[01:13:20.003 --> 01:13:22.304]  Some people think this war will be over in a couple months.
[01:13:22.344 --> 01:13:24.324]  Some people think it will be years.
[01:13:24.764 --> 01:13:28.485]  I tend to believe it's going to be years because that's what the West wants.
[01:13:28.505 --> 01:13:29.866]  That's what the Biden regime wants.
[01:13:29.886 --> 01:13:31.206]  They want this war to go on forever.
[01:13:31.466 --> 01:13:32.906]  It helps their stock portfolio.
[01:13:32.946 --> 01:13:34.527]  It helps the weapons manufacturers.
[01:13:34.587 --> 01:13:39.329]   It helps Them have a scapegoat on all the problems going on in America and the world.
[01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:42.011]  So the West, to me, wants this to go on as long as possible.
[01:13:42.391 --> 01:13:43.972]  I don't think that's what Russia wants.
[01:13:44.012 --> 01:13:45.793]  I think Russia has a pretty clear agenda here.
[01:13:46.133 --> 01:13:49.355]  De-Nazify, get rid of the biolabs, get rid of the Western corruption.
[01:13:50.215 --> 01:13:55.658]  But knowing all this, weighing all this, how long do you think this war is set to go on?
[01:13:55.718 --> 01:14:00.100]  How much resistance can Ukraine really put forth over a long period of time?
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:03.102]  Or will Russia eventually just be spun out?
[01:14:06.117 --> 01:14:13.702]  I'm going to go ahead and confirm for you right now that anything going on in Ukraine is 100% at the mercy of Russia.
[01:14:14.221 --> 01:14:19.140]   Any of these narratives that are trying to say that Ukraine is standing up to Russia,
[01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:20.140]  that is simply not the case.
[01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:23.400]   Russia is operating under a specific set of rules of engagement.
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:26.181]   If they wanted to flatten Ukraine, they could have done that in the first week.
[01:14:26.181 --> 01:14:29.461]   They could have completely leveled the entire country, moved in, taken over, slaughtered
[01:14:29.461 --> 01:14:32.301]   all the civilians, and we wouldn't have any questions about it.
[01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:35.900]   But they're conducting a specific military operation, as per Putin, and they're Russian
[01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:36.900]  military.
[01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:43.501]   So they're acting in a diplomatic fashion, and they presented these things through the
[01:14:43.501 --> 01:14:49.221]   proper diplomatic channels through the UN, accusing the US of creating biological weapons
[01:14:49.221 --> 01:14:49.900]  on their border.
[01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:59.900]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:14:50.928 --> 01:14:53.350]  So, honestly, this is entirely up to Russia.
[01:14:54.210 --> 01:14:58.533]  Russia hasn't really advanced any farther, and the media doesn't really seem to want to talk about that.
[01:14:58.553 --> 01:15:09.740]   They just want to keep showing you all these dead bodies and such, but Russia has been rather reserved in a sense, as opposed to this dictatorial Quickly, what is your view of Zelensky?
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:13.640]  painted on Putin, but it's entirely up to Russia.
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:15.720]  Whenever Russia wants to end this, they will end it.
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:19.079]   Whenever Russia feels like they have neutralized the threat, which they view as a threat to
[01:15:19.079 --> 01:15:21.919]  their people, they'll stop.
[01:15:21.919 --> 01:15:26.279]  Quickly, what is your view of Zelensky?
[01:15:26.279 --> 01:15:36.259]   Well, he's a former actor, and he's clearly either in control of or loyal to the globalists.
[01:15:36.259 --> 01:15:41.259]   I don't know if he's an actor for good forces that's just playing a part to take down the
[01:15:41.259 --> 01:15:46.980]   deep state, or if he's just a complete rat that obviously is under control of the deep
[01:15:47.298 --> 01:15:55.565]  I do not know, but I know he's acting and he's playing a role and he's not really any sort of militaristic or presidential force in Ukraine.
[01:15:56.026 --> 01:15:58.648]  It's controlled via proxies via the NATO and the U.S.
[01:16:00.259 --> 01:16:02.241]  Jacob Creech, great interview.
[01:16:02.401 --> 01:16:03.482]  We thank you for joining us.
[01:16:03.562 --> 01:16:06.324]  Tell people where they can follow you and get all this information.
[01:16:08.285 --> 01:16:13.309]  Yes, so as you know, I've probably been deplatformed everywhere, but I'm currently operating on Telegram.
[01:16:13.329 --> 01:16:16.892]  You can find my channel at bioclandestine on Telegram.
[01:16:17.212 --> 01:16:21.836]  My sub stack where you can get my newsletter is bioclandestine.substack.com.
[01:16:22.396 --> 01:16:24.178]  And I just recently got onto Truth Social.
[01:16:24.218 --> 01:16:25.218]  I'm still on the waiting list.
[01:16:25.559 --> 01:16:28.361]  You can find me at clandestine on Truth Social.
[01:16:29.184 --> 01:16:34.793]  Jacob Creech, excellent breakdown, great work there with Bioclandestine, and we thank you for joining us here today.
[01:16:36.047 --> 01:16:36.568]  Of course, Owen.
[01:16:36.588 --> 01:16:37.688]  Thank you so much, I appreciate it.
[01:16:38.069 --> 01:16:40.070]  Alright, there goes Jacob Kreech, and you heard him, folks.
[01:16:40.110 --> 01:16:41.872]  I mean, he gets deplatformed.
[01:16:41.912 --> 01:16:52.621]  If you don't go along with the mainstream narrative, if you do your own investigative research and you put out facts that the globalists don't want out there on their social media platforms, they remove you.
[01:16:53.281 --> 01:16:56.704]  But we're glad that Jacob was able to come on air with us today and speak his mind.
[01:16:57.064 --> 01:16:59.987]  We like people to get banned by the corrupt establishment.
[01:17:00.167 --> 01:17:00.868]  That's a good sign.
[01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:05.824]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are down to the final 2,000.
[01:17:06.565 --> 01:17:08.127]  In fact, it's going to be less than that.
[01:17:08.167 --> 01:17:09.769]  That was the number as of this morning.
[01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:23.766]   We're now under 2,000 of our limited edition Number two coin in the set of three, Tree of Liberty coin, at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:17:23.786 --> 01:17:40.558]  You go to the storefront, you click on the image that we have there of the limited edition coin, and that will take you to 1776 coin or Patriot Collectibles to purchase your limited edition, which we also now have on sale.
[01:17:41.118 --> 01:17:41.979]  Originally it was 150, now 130.
[01:17:42.059 --> 01:17:53.386]   This pure silver coin Is a limited edition run, less than 2,000 left, and it is an investment.
[01:17:54.247 --> 01:18:04.017]  Now, yes, silver is a precious metal that a lot of people think is being synthetically kept down, the price of it, that is, by the central banks.
[01:18:04.558 --> 01:18:08.502]  But no, I'm not talking about making an investment in precious metals or silver here.
[01:18:10.114 --> 01:18:11.335]  Though there is an inherent value.
[01:18:11.575 --> 01:18:13.137]  You're investing in free speech.
[01:18:13.257 --> 01:18:15.018]  You're investing in free press.
[01:18:15.078 --> 01:18:17.340]  You're investing in keeping InfoWars on the air.
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:26.848]  That's the investment that you make when you purchase the limited edition Tree of Liberty silver coin from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:18:27.789 --> 01:18:32.733]  And I gotta tell you folks, because look, I'm human just like anybody else.
[01:18:32.853 --> 01:18:37.517]  I can have a range of emotions like anybody else a lot of times that pours out here on the air.
[01:18:39.175 --> 01:18:49.086]  Let me just tell you, I want to have a moment here with this crew and this audience to celebrate and say, we're still here.
[01:18:50.628 --> 01:18:51.629]  That is a victory.
[01:18:52.570 --> 01:18:54.953]  So free speech is not dead yet in this country.
[01:18:56.775 --> 01:19:07.857]   And when you go and you invest in the Second set of three limited edition silver coins from Infowarsstore.com, you're keeping us alive.
[01:19:07.937 --> 01:19:09.237]  You're keeping free speech alive.
[01:19:09.257 --> 01:19:09.938]  So yeah, you know what?
[01:19:10.418 --> 01:19:21.962]  Free speech in America right now is bloody, it's battered, it's bruised, it's got limbs blown off, it's gimping up and down, just trying to move with a crutch that's also been blown up.
[01:19:23.123 --> 01:19:26.964]  But it's not dead yet, and we're still fighting for it, and you're hoisting it up.
[01:19:30.057 --> 01:19:32.579]  Infowars as an example of free speech.
[01:19:33.119 --> 01:19:34.240]  So we appreciate that.
[01:19:35.201 --> 01:19:37.782]  And it is this coin that's going to fund us for the next couple months.
[01:19:38.583 --> 01:19:41.045]  And then just selling out of everything we have on the website.
[01:19:41.905 --> 01:19:43.807]  We're basically just looking to get the funds in, folks.
[01:19:43.847 --> 01:19:47.309]  I mean, we really don't know what's going to go down with the legal stuff.
[01:19:48.270 --> 01:19:51.972]  That's always kind of a mystery, except that we know they just want to destroy us, and that's why they do it.
[01:19:53.493 --> 01:19:54.294]  Folks, I'll tell you.
[01:19:56.816 --> 01:20:04.361]   You know, Alex is a little more Transparent, I'll say, with some of the legal stuff, and you still really only get the tip of the iceberg.
[01:20:04.581 --> 01:20:05.962]  But man, oh man, let me tell you.
[01:20:07.464 --> 01:20:10.766]  If and when all this is behind us, there are gonna be stories to tell.
[01:20:12.688 --> 01:20:20.494]  I mean, I... I got something that happened to me yesterday morning that is just insane.
[01:20:21.695 --> 01:20:22.516]  Just insane.
[01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:31.964]  But I'm not going to say on air, and I'm going to withhold it, and eventually, you know, I imagine eventually this stuff's going to be behind us.
[01:20:32.004 --> 01:20:34.326]  It might not go well, but it'll eventually be behind us.
[01:20:35.106 --> 01:20:49.435]  And we'll tell the stories, and I mean, look, I'm dealing with, we're dealing with, you're dealing with full-on authoritarian, tyrant-style censorship and attack on free speech in this country.
[01:20:50.558 --> 01:20:58.784]  But together, we're still here, we're still on air, we're still getting the great guests, we're still breaking the news and information, and so that alone is a victory.
[01:20:58.824 --> 01:21:10.732]  So I salute you in the audience, I salute this crew, and we will continue to fight for truth and freedom in America, using our free speech to do it, until they rip our larynx out, put a bullet through our head, or throw us in a prison.
[01:21:11.212 --> 01:21:13.114]  And believe me, they're considering all three.
[01:21:14.275 --> 01:21:24.283]   But man, oh man, I'll tell ya, when all this is behind us, whether for good or bad, It's just the stories that Alex and myself and others are going to be able to tell.
[01:21:24.303 --> 01:21:28.146]  I mean, I'm telling you folks, it's just mind-blowing.
[01:21:29.407 --> 01:21:34.971]  Because I really, I mean, obviously you've got to have an ego to talk to yourself on air for three hours a day.
[01:21:34.991 --> 01:21:39.534]  I'm not denying I have a massive ego here, but like, I don't really think of myself as that big of a deal.
[01:21:40.996 --> 01:21:43.858]  I think the world will turn just fine without me, whether I'm here or not.
[01:21:45.162 --> 01:21:52.286]  But then you go through the crap that we're going through here and you're like, wow, I... Boy, they really want me gone!
[01:21:52.726 --> 01:21:54.948]  Like, they really hate little old me!
[01:21:56.689 --> 01:21:58.750]  And it's just, it's just wild.
[01:21:59.670 --> 01:22:01.331]  But, uh, I'm gonna leave it right there.
[01:22:01.391 --> 01:22:01.912]  Just know...
[01:22:03.268 --> 01:22:13.073]  I mean, you're seeing a little maybe more than the tip of the iceberg, just because of the recent stuff getting into the news and Alex being a little bit more transparent about some of the stuff that goes on behind the scenes here.
[01:22:13.453 --> 01:22:18.216]  But just overall, you're seeing the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the attack InfoWars is under.
[01:22:19.016 --> 01:22:21.157]  Regardless, you've kept us on air.
[01:22:21.417 --> 01:22:22.838]  Quite frankly, you're a miracle.
[01:22:22.878 --> 01:22:23.758]  You're our lifeblood.
[01:22:24.238 --> 01:22:25.699]  And we thank you for it.
[01:22:25.739 --> 01:22:28.140]  So we're trying to sell out of everything at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:30.641]  That's why all the t-shirts and apparel is on sale at cost.
[01:22:31.062 --> 01:22:38.205]  That's why we're selling the supplements, top-rated supplements, at a discounted price at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:22:39.105 --> 01:22:40.306]  We just want to be here, folks.
[01:22:40.646 --> 01:22:44.708]  I don't need a million dollars, okay?
[01:22:44.908 --> 01:22:51.949]   This platform right here This ability to come on air and talk to you is worth trillions of dollars to me.
[01:22:51.989 --> 01:22:55.611]  There's no amount of money that could ever fulfill that.
[01:22:55.711 --> 01:22:57.511]  There's no amount of money that could ever match that.
[01:22:58.792 --> 01:22:59.112]  Okay?
[01:23:00.332 --> 01:23:01.232]  So, I thank you.
[01:23:02.553 --> 01:23:03.853]  I don't need to be a millionaire.
[01:23:03.893 --> 01:23:05.014]  I don't need gobs of money.
[01:23:05.054 --> 01:23:06.594]  I don't need a bunch of big fancy houses.
[01:23:06.634 --> 01:23:07.394]  Yeah, that's nice.
[01:23:07.434 --> 01:23:08.115]  I'm a capitalist.
[01:23:08.155 --> 01:23:08.795]  I'm all for that.
[01:23:08.835 --> 01:23:09.435]  You've got that.
[01:23:10.115 --> 01:23:12.376]  But that's not what we're here for and you know it.
[01:23:13.637 --> 01:23:14.377]  And that's why you're here.
[01:23:14.437 --> 01:23:14.717]  Alright.
[01:23:15.865 --> 01:23:24.609]  Let me just put away the rest of this news when it comes to Russia and Ukraine and then we'll get into the rest of this news in the second, or excuse me, the third hour of today's transmission.
[01:23:26.510 --> 01:23:32.692]  FBI seizes $90 million yacht owned by Putin ally Viktor Vekelsberg in Spain.
[01:23:32.772 --> 01:23:36.994]  So now the Feds and the global government, which they say doesn't exist, oh really?
[01:23:37.254 --> 01:23:41.076]  Then why are they all going after these Russian millionaires' yachts?
[01:23:42.537 --> 01:23:42.937]  Hey, look!
[01:23:44.229 --> 01:23:51.012]  You want to complain about people being too rich and buying these ridiculous yachts that they probably use like four times a year?
[01:23:51.052 --> 01:23:51.592]  Hey, fine.
[01:23:51.812 --> 01:23:52.513]  Complain all day.
[01:23:53.613 --> 01:23:57.515]  But let's not sit here and act like Americans don't do that.
[01:23:59.275 --> 01:24:11.901]  And let's not sit here and act like it's a good thing that there's some sort of global government faction or that the FBI can go over to Spain and steal a Russian's yacht.
[01:24:13.561 --> 01:24:15.662]  Do you think that's a smart move by the U.S.
[01:24:15.682 --> 01:24:16.062]  government?
[01:24:16.682 --> 01:24:18.022]  No, that's saber-rattling.
[01:24:18.042 --> 01:24:21.063]  That's adding to the war front.
[01:24:21.603 --> 01:24:24.804]  That's adding to the strife between Russia and the West.
[01:24:25.764 --> 01:24:26.944]  And it's just totally illegal!
[01:24:27.104 --> 01:24:29.485]  Why don't the FBI just go seize someone's yacht?
[01:24:29.785 --> 01:24:33.386]  I don't care how bad this billionaire Russian might be.
[01:24:33.406 --> 01:24:39.087]  If he's not chopping up kids or having Pedophile Island like Epstein, then leave him the damn hell alone!
[01:24:39.987 --> 01:24:42.648]  Oh, he's a Russian now, and being Russian's a crime now!
[01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:44.881]  So that's what they do!
[01:24:46.342 --> 01:24:50.104]  They just put this marker on you like, oh, you're a Russian, therefore you're a criminal.
[01:24:50.284 --> 01:24:50.585]  No!
[01:24:51.605 --> 01:24:53.607]  Oh, you're a Trump supporter, therefore you're a criminal.
[01:24:53.807 --> 01:24:54.127]  No!
[01:24:56.469 --> 01:25:10.877]   But that's the mindset, and the reason why the left buys into that Just head over heels is because it's such an intellectual, unintellectual position to take, it's the easy way in, so they just go with the easy way in.
[01:25:10.917 --> 01:25:13.339]  The most unintellectual... Oh yeah, Russian bad!
[01:25:13.399 --> 01:25:14.520]  Oh yeah, Trump supporter bad!
[01:25:14.540 --> 01:25:14.800]  Yeah!
[01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:23.365]  And they just jump on board with that because it requires zero intellect, zero critical thinking, which at this point, I'm not even sure if they have the capacity to do.
[01:25:24.586 --> 01:25:29.369]  Honestly, these people have been so soul-sucked and so demonically possessed and so brainwashed.
[01:25:29.389 --> 01:25:30.110]  I mean, we've seen it.
[01:25:34.013 --> 01:25:36.775]  So this is just going to probably continue to happen.
[01:25:37.936 --> 01:25:47.744]  And then the goal here is for the West to isolate Putin, and they want all of these millionaires and billionaires in Russia to turn against Putin, which folks, this just shows you it's not working.
[01:25:48.604 --> 01:25:54.429]  So the more you see this activity from the corrupt feds, the more you know that Russia's actually winning.
[01:25:55.307 --> 01:26:03.089]  Okay, let me tell you, if Russia was losing, they wouldn't feel the need to go steal a bunch of Russian millionaires' property and yachts.
[01:26:03.769 --> 01:26:10.991]  But because Russia and Putin are winning, they have to go do that to try to isolate Putin from his own people.
[01:26:11.771 --> 01:26:13.211]  And it's not working, folks.
[01:26:13.691 --> 01:26:21.073]  And our chicken-necked, nelly, pencil-needled dick, Merrick Garland, like, oh my gosh.
[01:26:21.233 --> 01:26:24.134]  See, that's the thing is, Merrick Garland wants my head on a stick!
[01:26:26.667 --> 01:26:30.750]  So it's like, I realize now, oh, I go on air and I say something bad about Merrick Garland.
[01:26:30.971 --> 01:26:34.874]  He literally has the power and the will to destroy me!
[01:26:38.077 --> 01:26:39.498]  But you tell me who's the bad guy.
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:41.560]  So...
[01:26:43.442 --> 01:26:50.807]  That's just going to continue to happen, and it's not going to help for peace efforts, and it's certainly not hurting Putin.
[01:26:51.348 --> 01:26:54.390]  Airbnb cancels all reservations in Russia and Belarus.
[01:26:54.410 --> 01:26:58.393]  Yes, if you have an account based out of Russia or Belarus, you can no longer use Airbnb.
[01:26:58.853 --> 01:26:59.714]  Oh, that's funny.
[01:27:00.215 --> 01:27:03.317]  Neither can I. I was banned from Airbnb.
[01:27:03.497 --> 01:27:08.781]  Doesn't matter, I had about 30, 40 perfect five-star ratings, never anything negative.
[01:27:08.941 --> 01:27:09.521]  They banned me!
[01:27:10.595 --> 01:27:11.095]  So that's it.
[01:27:11.155 --> 01:27:13.837]  You're a Russian, you're a Trump supporter, you're a criminal.
[01:27:13.918 --> 01:27:16.718]  No, that's not how justice works on this planet, you liars.
[01:27:16.718 --> 01:27:27.718]  April 2022 just kicked off and it's already been incredible.
[01:27:28.308 --> 01:27:40.213]   Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, Joe Biden, They, along with many other New World Order operatives, have gone on national television and announced that we are now under a world government.
[01:27:40.893 --> 01:27:47.817]  They have a summit taking place right now in Dubai, titled World Government Summit, and they are announcing incredible tyranny.
[01:27:48.317 --> 01:27:52.660]  Everything we've talked about is now coming true, and the globalists want to take us off air.
[01:27:53.564 --> 01:27:58.605]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are running the biggest sale in the history of InfoWars right now.
[01:27:59.145 --> 01:28:09.648]  In our 28 years, all InfoWars apparel is being sold at cost until the inventory is gone and we're never going to print these t-shirts and ball caps and InfoWars flags again.
[01:28:10.068 --> 01:28:12.909]  We may have t-shirts and apparel in the future, but I don't even know.
[01:28:13.309 --> 01:28:16.269]  We are blowing out of everything to get emergency funds in right now.
[01:28:16.609 --> 01:28:21.771]  I'm firing the bat signal and asking you to get your t-shirts at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[01:28:22.011 --> 01:28:22.851]  They're at cost.
[01:28:23.649 --> 01:28:35.960]  Alright, we're in the third hour of the Alex Jones Show here today, and I am just going to focus, and I'm going to try to get all of this news off my desk as quickly as possible, and then play the video clips that I have for you today.
[01:28:36.701 --> 01:28:41.926]  So, without any further hesitation, let me just move on here, Berserker-style, into this news.
[01:28:43.663 --> 01:28:50.328]  Pope Francis removes cross from event in Malta so not to upset illegal Muslim migrants.
[01:28:50.468 --> 01:28:51.268]  Isn't that nice?
[01:28:51.348 --> 01:28:53.850]  The Pope removes the cross.
[01:28:55.391 --> 01:28:58.213]  The Pope removes a cross at a public event.
[01:28:58.714 --> 01:29:02.196]  You still think this is the Pope that you're told he is?
[01:29:02.216 --> 01:29:05.278]  You still think this is the Catholic Church as you're supposed to believe it is?
[01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:11.523]  No, ladies and gentlemen, this is a communist, globalist Pope.
[01:29:12.759 --> 01:29:16.704]  That helps cover up child abuse stories that come out of the Vatican.
[01:29:19.208 --> 01:29:20.169]  Evil, evil everywhere.
[01:29:20.590 --> 01:29:21.150]  Time's up.
[01:29:21.371 --> 01:29:24.795]  Orban wins Hungary despite massive Soros assault.
[01:29:24.875 --> 01:29:30.263]  That, folks, I mean, I'm not going to sit here and tell you what to think about Orban, but he's a nationalist.
[01:29:31.858 --> 01:29:36.679]  And he's against the globalist agenda of sexualizing kids and getting rid of borders.
[01:29:37.599 --> 01:29:43.461]  So Soros did everything he possibly could to stop Orban from getting in.
[01:29:43.921 --> 01:29:51.922]  Probably not near the effort of what they undertook to keep Trump from getting in again, but it's a similar story, just at a smaller grade.
[01:29:52.843 --> 01:29:54.343]  But he was able to overcome.
[01:29:55.359 --> 01:29:59.502]  And, um, his party is doing quite well in Hungary.
[01:30:00.082 --> 01:30:11.370]  So that's a very, uh, very important asset Hungary as a country to have against the new world order agenda in that region of the world.
[01:30:11.970 --> 01:30:18.755]  So again, whether you like Orban or hate him, uh, the globalists are your enemy and they don't like Orban.
[01:30:18.915 --> 01:30:20.476]  And so that's, that's good news.
[01:30:21.597 --> 01:30:38.340]   The reason for Zelensky surprise Grammy's appearance, you know, People are so sick of Hollywood garbage and arrogance, and it's so bad that they have to fake a slap with Will Smith and Chris Rock just to drum up any hype or any ratings at all.
[01:30:39.341 --> 01:30:41.042]  And so now it's the same thing at the Grammys.
[01:30:41.822 --> 01:30:44.885]  They have to have Zelensky Skype in?
[01:30:44.905 --> 01:30:48.027]  I didn't watch the Grammys.
[01:30:48.847 --> 01:30:50.168]  I did see some stories about it.
[01:30:50.728 --> 01:30:51.769]  The same typical stuff.
[01:30:51.889 --> 01:31:10.951]   Okay, here's your war propaganda, and then They had a nice little satanic performance from their favorite satanist, Lil Nas, who does videos depicting sex with Satan and who claims to be, I guess, a non-binary man who gets pregnant, too.
[01:31:10.971 --> 01:31:12.192]  I mean, it's all satanism.
[01:31:13.553 --> 01:31:16.074]  Lil Nas delivers satanic performance during Grammys.
[01:31:16.955 --> 01:31:17.595]  He loves it, though.
[01:31:17.615 --> 01:31:18.596]  I mean, he loves the attention.
[01:31:18.996 --> 01:31:20.958]  And quite frankly, he's probably an idiot.
[01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:24.341]  He probably has an IQ of about 13.
[01:31:24.981 --> 01:31:27.923]  And so they just take advantage of him and they say, all right, here's what you're going to do.
[01:31:28.983 --> 01:31:31.944]  Um, and you're going to make millions of dollars.
[01:31:31.964 --> 01:31:33.885]  And that's how they, that's how they buy your soul.
[01:31:34.506 --> 01:31:36.006]  They say you're going to be rich and famous.
[01:31:36.046 --> 01:31:37.567]  And they find enough people that like that.
[01:31:39.161 --> 01:31:55.672]  And so that's what you see where they do, like, oh, here's all the commentary, here's all the negative tweets, here's everything bad that they say about Lil Nas X, but look, here I am, still sexualizing your kids, here I am, still doing satanic performances, and I'm rich and famous, and he has no idea what's going on.
[01:31:57.133 --> 01:32:05.699]  He just is fulfilling his duty of performing and getting on tracks and then doing satanic performances and sexualizing the children.
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:10.663]  It's really just sad, isn't it?
[01:32:12.726 --> 01:32:13.808]  It's really just sad.
[01:32:17.214 --> 01:32:21.721]  But see, this is why when you watch movies like The Fifth Element...
[01:32:22.830 --> 01:32:34.374]  And they have the character portrayed by, what's the actor's name, who's the host, and he's just totally goofy, dresses like a whack job, acts like a buzzed out whack job.
[01:32:34.914 --> 01:32:35.754]  Yeah, Chris Tucker.
[01:32:36.194 --> 01:32:37.535]  Because that's the future they want.
[01:32:37.615 --> 01:32:43.857]  It's like, these movies are all projection, or just like a warning, or even just foresight.
[01:32:44.897 --> 01:32:46.638]  It's like, yeah, this is where they want you to take ya.
[01:32:47.537 --> 01:32:48.577]  This is where they're taking you.
[01:32:49.198 --> 01:32:52.379]  I mean, Hunger Games, the same, it's the same thing everywhere.
[01:32:52.399 --> 01:32:56.440]  It doesn't matter whether it's a movie from the 80s or the 90s or just a couple years ago.
[01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:57.260]  It's the same thing.
[01:32:57.721 --> 01:33:06.524]  How come in these dystopian futures with the caste system, the elite are all dressed like alien freak shows, non-binary sex addicts?
[01:33:07.384 --> 01:33:09.666]  Because that's what they're promoting to children!
[01:33:10.106 --> 01:33:12.668]  That's what they're telling the kids is cool and in!
[01:33:12.748 --> 01:33:14.329]  That's what they're trying to create!
[01:33:14.730 --> 01:33:15.831]  We reject that!
[01:33:16.551 --> 01:33:22.636]  Yeah, you're a far cry removed from the days of Johnny Cash and Johnny Carson, aren't ya?
[01:33:23.857 --> 01:33:25.938]  No, now you got Lil Nas X!
[01:33:27.660 --> 01:33:29.081]  Suckin' Satan's D!
[01:33:31.903 --> 01:33:34.145]  And Zelensky promoting war propaganda!
[01:33:36.559 --> 01:33:44.304]  And Stephen Colbert, not funny, but promoting vaccines all day, and a spokesman for the Democrat Party.
[01:33:45.424 --> 01:33:47.485]  And see, I want you to understand something.
[01:33:47.505 --> 01:33:54.289]  I'm going to eventually get to this stack of news over here, but I kind of want to build up to it, because you need to understand where all of this funnels.
[01:33:55.130 --> 01:33:57.911]  So let me just give you these headlines and then retreat back to it.
[01:33:57.971 --> 01:34:01.994]  So this is where all of this funnels.
[01:34:03.158 --> 01:34:10.544]  All the stuff that I'm going to cover, the cultural rot, the political rot, all the corruption, all the propaganda, this is where it all funnels.
[01:34:11.004 --> 01:34:19.151]  And when you have the prospectus of the death cult and the eugenics that run this planet, you get it.
[01:34:19.991 --> 01:34:21.393]  It's like 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[01:34:22.113 --> 01:34:22.814]  And that's the problem.
[01:34:22.834 --> 01:34:23.794]  See, because this is what it is.
[01:34:24.195 --> 01:34:36.468]   When you go through life, And you know 2 plus 2 equals 4, but you keep experiencing 2 plus 2 equals 5, or 2 plus 2 equals 3, or 2 plus 2 equals 10, and you're like, this doesn't make sense.
[01:34:36.748 --> 01:34:37.728]  You go insane.
[01:34:37.748 --> 01:34:39.949]  You become suicidal.
[01:34:41.869 --> 01:34:44.790]  Why so many women in middle age are on antidepressants.
[01:34:45.310 --> 01:34:45.990]  Wall Street Journal.
[01:34:46.391 --> 01:34:47.131]  Washington Post.
[01:34:47.171 --> 01:34:47.911]  A cry for help.
[01:34:47.951 --> 01:34:50.492]  CDC warns of steep decline in teen mental health.
[01:34:51.132 --> 01:34:51.652]  New Yorker.
[01:34:51.712 --> 01:34:54.233]  The mystifying rise of child suicide.
[01:34:55.540 --> 01:34:56.700]  Former French Intelligence Chief.
[01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:59.341]  All multicultural societies are doomed.
[01:34:59.621 --> 01:35:04.803]  So just understand, all the stuff, everything I'm covering, it funnels into the same eugenics program.
[01:35:06.424 --> 01:35:10.945]  They don't have to just drop a bomb on you if they can make you so miserable that you kill yourself.
[01:35:12.266 --> 01:35:16.127]  Now whether that's literally jumping off a building or putting a bullet through your brain, no.
[01:35:16.447 --> 01:35:24.470]  You'll kill yourself with the poisoned food, you'll kill yourself with the poisoned water, you'll kill yourself with the poisoned drugs, or you'll literally kill yourself.
[01:35:26.298 --> 01:35:34.520]  Or, if you're able to survive all of this, you'll plug into some false synthetic reality matrix that they'll be in total control of, like the metaverse.
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:37.021]  Which is being totally rejected, by the way.
[01:35:39.021 --> 01:35:40.361]  So that's where all of this funnels.
[01:35:41.642 --> 01:35:45.243]  Now, let's cover the rest of this news.
[01:35:45.783 --> 01:35:49.964]  Amy Schumer reveals the Alec Baldwin shooting joke she wasn't allowed to make at the Oscars.
[01:35:50.004 --> 01:35:52.864]  So, apparently, I guess the Oscars checks all the jokes.
[01:35:52.904 --> 01:35:53.365]  That's nice.
[01:35:53.385 --> 01:35:54.685]  You guys are really about freedom of speech, huh?
[01:35:55.598 --> 01:35:58.580]  No, it's all a controlled corporate event.
[01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:02.222]  So she was going to make a joke about the movie, Look Up.
[01:36:03.903 --> 01:36:10.827]  And so she said the joke was going to be, it's better to look up than to look down at the barrel of Alec Baldwin's gun.
[01:36:12.088 --> 01:36:13.309]  That was actually a pretty good one.
[01:36:13.389 --> 01:36:14.870]  That'd probably be the funniest joke of the night.
[01:36:15.911 --> 01:36:16.692]  Not allowed to say it.
[01:36:16.792 --> 01:36:19.554]  So Alec Baldwin is under complete and total protection.
[01:36:19.954 --> 01:36:30.562]  Alec Baldwin literally, he denies actually, the gun is in his hand, the bullet goes out of the gun and through a woman's head and kills her, and he says he didn't pull the trigger.
[01:36:31.762 --> 01:36:32.423]  Amazing!
[01:36:32.663 --> 01:36:39.488]  But I guess if you believe all the lies that the liberal left tells you, then yeah, guns do whatever they want.
[01:36:39.568 --> 01:36:40.589]  Guns think for themselves.
[01:36:40.629 --> 01:36:41.870]  Guns shoot themselves even.
[01:36:43.547 --> 01:36:47.488]  So I guess that's Alec Baldwin's argument is that guns shoot themselves.
[01:36:48.569 --> 01:36:54.790]  It doesn't matter whose hand he's in, whose hand the gun is in, so I guess all people that killed someone or shot a gun should be innocent like Alec Baldwin, right?
[01:36:56.131 --> 01:36:57.951]  No, that's called liberal Democrat privilege.
[01:36:57.971 --> 01:36:59.172]  That's called Hollywood privilege.
[01:36:59.392 --> 01:37:06.534]  And then he gets protected by the Oscars producers and they say, you can't make a joke about Alec Baldwin.
[01:37:07.894 --> 01:37:09.815]  I have never harmed a person in my life.
[01:37:10.652 --> 01:37:13.676]  And I've spent more time in jail than Alec Baldwin who shot a woman dead.
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:21.485]  Now, at the very least, it's involuntary manslaughter, is it not?
[01:37:23.107 --> 01:37:23.587]  Doesn't matter.
[01:37:23.767 --> 01:37:29.174]  Alec Baldwin is a good liberal Democrat Hollywood star, so he's above the law.
[01:37:30.828 --> 01:37:33.450]  Me, for walking outside of the Capitol?
[01:37:33.691 --> 01:37:42.999]  I'm dealing with millions of dollars in legal fines, Feds spending millions of dollars to come up with me, Feds pouring through all my electronic devices right now as we speak.
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:46.903]  I'm facing huge jail time.
[01:37:47.083 --> 01:37:48.704]  I've already been locked up multiple times.
[01:37:49.824 --> 01:37:53.125]  But see, I should not have stepped on grass outside of the Capitol.
[01:37:53.225 --> 01:37:57.887]  I should have been like Alec Baldwin, a good liberal progressive Hollywood actor, and I should have shot a woman in the head.
[01:37:58.347 --> 01:37:59.928]  Oh wait, I'm sorry, the gun did that.
[01:37:59.988 --> 01:38:00.948]  He had nothing to do with it.
[01:38:01.008 --> 01:38:01.969]  The gun acted on its own.
[01:38:03.769 --> 01:38:05.750]  I demand that gun be put on trial!
[01:38:07.191 --> 01:38:08.251]  Just unbelievable stuff.
[01:38:10.032 --> 01:38:14.013]  Ukrainian MP claims Russian soldiers burned swastika into woman's belly.
[01:38:14.053 --> 01:38:14.833]  So it's the same thing.
[01:38:15.174 --> 01:38:17.154]  Russia says it was the Ukrainians that did it.
[01:38:17.354 --> 01:38:18.835]  Ukrainians say it was Russia that did it.
[01:38:20.026 --> 01:38:26.367]  You know, who knows, folks, but like our guest said, there are things we do know.
[01:38:26.787 --> 01:38:27.288]  The U.S.
[01:38:27.328 --> 01:38:29.588]  was running at least 20 biological weapons labs.
[01:38:30.068 --> 01:38:37.090]  Hunter Biden's family business was involved in it, as were other family members of American politicians.
[01:38:38.070 --> 01:38:44.851]  The media lied about it, and the lab in China that did the same thing was responsible for the COVID outbreak.
[01:38:46.132 --> 01:38:47.172]  Now think about this, though.
[01:38:50.046 --> 01:38:53.307]  It came out that the U.S.
[01:38:53.347 --> 01:39:01.530]  government was taking the results from PCR tests for your nose, the nose swab, that the U.S.
[01:39:01.570 --> 01:39:08.113]  government was taking DNA samples from those tests and putting it into a database.
[01:39:09.573 --> 01:39:24.527]   It was already well known that companies that were doing DNA testing Oh yeah, you get your DNA tested, they tell you whether you're African, or Native American, or Italian, or whatever, if you even believe that crap.
[01:39:24.707 --> 01:39:28.289]  Quite frankly, I'm not even sure if I believe it, but whatever, people have it done, it's fun, it's curious.
[01:39:28.910 --> 01:39:31.472]  It came out that they were selling that information!
[01:39:32.553 --> 01:39:33.654]  So think about it like this.
[01:39:35.275 --> 01:39:39.978]  You go in, innocent enough, you want to take a COVID no-swab test to see if you got COVID.
[01:39:40.739 --> 01:39:41.139]  Okay?
[01:39:41.740 --> 01:39:45.703]  That DNA sequencing may have been sold, may have been passed along.
[01:39:45.763 --> 01:39:46.864]  Did you sign off on that?
[01:39:48.291 --> 01:39:53.013]  You submit a sample of your DNA, I'm not sure how they do it, they either do hair or spit or whatever, I don't know.
[01:39:54.333 --> 01:39:55.033]  I would never do it.
[01:39:57.154 --> 01:40:04.176]  And you submit your DNA to these companies and they say, okay, yeah, here's your results, you're African or you're European, whatever.
[01:40:05.177 --> 01:40:07.417]  And then that gets shared or that gets sold.
[01:40:07.577 --> 01:40:11.999]  And now your DNA somehow is out there.
[01:40:12.259 --> 01:40:15.160]  In the marketplace, being sold, traded, bought, everything.
[01:40:16.448 --> 01:40:24.231]  And now you've got biological weapons labs that make DNA-specific weapons.
[01:40:26.111 --> 01:40:29.573]  That was the plot of the latest James Bond movie, by the way.
[01:40:29.853 --> 01:40:31.153]  No spoiler here, just telling you.
[01:40:34.154 --> 01:40:36.515]  I mean, folks, we are not in Kansas anymore.
[01:40:36.575 --> 01:40:39.576]  Can't you understand the dangerous implications of all of this?
[01:40:39.916 --> 01:40:40.976]  Russia certainly does.
[01:40:41.237 --> 01:40:42.197]  Putin certainly does.
[01:40:43.646 --> 01:40:48.467]  Hell, you can say Putin is the worst person on the planet, but he gets the dangers of that!
[01:40:49.988 --> 01:41:02.911]  Putin understands the dangers of having biological weapons labs that make DNA-specific weapons with all these people volunteering unwittingly their DNA out on the marketplace to be bought and sold however it's fit!
[01:41:04.652 --> 01:41:05.072]  Yeah!
[01:41:07.472 --> 01:41:11.774]  Should you be worried about somebody making a biological weapon specifically to kill you?
[01:41:12.074 --> 01:41:12.754]  Probably not!
[01:41:13.865 --> 01:41:14.705]  But it's out there!
[01:41:15.566 --> 01:41:16.246]  Could be done!
[01:41:18.107 --> 01:41:18.967]  Kind of a big deal.
[01:41:19.067 --> 01:41:19.868]  Putin knows that.
[01:41:19.988 --> 01:41:21.869]  The American media doesn't want you to know what's going on.
[01:41:24.590 --> 01:41:28.391]  And of course, they're bringing back the COVID fear-mongering.
[01:41:29.672 --> 01:41:37.295]  Fauci is all excited because he saw the lockdowns in Shanghai, and then the massive testing of millions of people which drove case numbers up.
[01:41:37.755 --> 01:41:38.716]  Go figure.
[01:41:39.216 --> 01:41:42.097]  Testing 25 million people drove case numbers up?
[01:41:42.317 --> 01:41:43.258]  Who would have thought?
[01:41:45.205 --> 01:41:51.307]  And so now Fauci's saying, yeah, we're probably going to have to bring back lockdowns, and China's doing a good job there.
[01:41:51.987 --> 01:41:54.107]  These people are being held prisoner in China, folks.
[01:41:54.127 --> 01:41:54.548]  You understand?
[01:41:55.708 --> 01:41:59.389]  They're literally being held prisoner, and they can't even get food.
[01:42:00.069 --> 01:42:05.231]  And it's been two weeks now, and if you've run out of food or you've run out of stuff to drink, guess what?
[01:42:05.351 --> 01:42:05.651]  You're SOL.
[01:42:07.580 --> 01:42:10.442]  Yeah, you can try to call the government hotline to have food dropped off.
[01:42:10.462 --> 01:42:12.203]  You can try to call someone to have food dropped off.
[01:42:12.383 --> 01:42:18.207]  How do you think that's going to go with 25 million people starving, just looking for a couple thousand people to bring them food?
[01:42:18.227 --> 01:42:19.547]  How do you think that's going for them?
[01:42:19.868 --> 01:42:20.388]  Not well.
[01:42:21.689 --> 01:42:22.349]  And you watch.
[01:42:23.070 --> 01:42:29.474]  When all of this is said and done in Shanghai, they're going to be going into people's apartments and they're going to find dead bodies.
[01:42:30.394 --> 01:42:32.976]  People that starved out, people that killed themselves.
[01:42:34.428 --> 01:42:37.790]  But hey man, we're stopping COVID.
[01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:40.511]  I'm gonna kill you so you can't spread COVID.
[01:42:40.751 --> 01:42:44.113]  I'm gonna put you in a cage and lock you up so you can't spread COVID.
[01:42:45.794 --> 01:42:46.715]  Unbelievable stuff.
[01:42:47.075 --> 01:42:49.016]  A man-made virus.
[01:42:49.836 --> 01:42:51.197]  Anthony Fauci knew about it.
[01:42:51.977 --> 01:42:53.278]  The American media knew about it.
[01:42:53.338 --> 01:42:54.119]  They covered it up.
[01:42:54.219 --> 01:42:56.500]  They're complicit in this mass manslaughter.
[01:42:58.221 --> 01:43:02.043]  Alright, let's continue with our news coverage here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:43:03.479 --> 01:43:11.206]  Owen Schroyer, honored to be in here at the Infowars World Headquarters here in Austin, Texas with you here today.
[01:43:11.446 --> 01:43:23.516]  So again though, the media's celebrating, Fauci's celebrating, everybody's celebrating how China treats its citizens like slaves, where they're in their prison camps.
[01:43:24.057 --> 01:43:28.561]  You remember, oh no, it's just your apartment, but you're out of food, you can't even get food now.
[01:43:29.041 --> 01:43:39.824]   Remember what it was like in Australia Where they had the quarantine camps, and it was like, you couldn't leave your house, they had these people in hazmat suits delivering you food.
[01:43:41.045 --> 01:43:45.727]  If you stepped outside on the patio at the wrong time of day, they extended your lockdown, your imprisonment.
[01:43:45.747 --> 01:43:49.570]  I mean, who would ever support this garbage?
[01:43:49.610 --> 01:44:05.946]   But see, Fauci's out supporting it because He wants to use China as the example, as the standard, so that Fauci and the Democrats can run the same operation here in America, locking you down, treating you like a prisoner, under the guise of protecting you from a virus.
[01:44:06.006 --> 01:44:06.787]  Just a total lie.
[01:44:07.087 --> 01:44:09.948]  A virus that they made in a lab, by the way.
[01:44:10.469 --> 01:44:11.569]  And so here's my problem.
[01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:17.132]  When I see stories like this, I can't tell you how frustrated I get.
[01:44:18.853 --> 01:44:23.986]   Because it's the same level of I don't even know what you would call it.
[01:44:24.166 --> 01:44:24.667]  Ignorance?
[01:44:24.727 --> 01:44:25.347]  Stupidity?
[01:44:27.249 --> 01:44:29.310]  Where they say, look at what COVID did.
[01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:30.891]  COVID shut down the schools.
[01:44:31.432 --> 01:44:33.273]  COVID closed my business.
[01:44:33.393 --> 01:44:34.294]  COVID did this.
[01:44:34.394 --> 01:44:35.095]  COVID did that.
[01:44:35.195 --> 01:44:36.716]  COVID did none of that.
[01:44:37.436 --> 01:44:39.378]  The government did all of it.
[01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:47.504]  That is a... I mean, even the lowest IQ people should have that understanding, and they don't.
[01:44:47.644 --> 01:44:59.518]   It's supposed intellectuals That go on TV, academics, politicians, and they come out and they say, COVID did this, COVID did this, because of the virus, because of the virus.
[01:44:59.618 --> 01:44:59.798]  No.
[01:45:00.238 --> 01:45:03.999]  Government did this, period, end of story, end of sentence.
[01:45:04.219 --> 01:45:04.599]  Stop.
[01:45:05.179 --> 01:45:06.320]  Stop saying COVID.
[01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:11.821]  So this story has that same energy, has that same vibe.
[01:45:13.502 --> 01:45:14.422]  COVID horror.
[01:45:15.282 --> 01:45:20.104]  Virus may cause brain damage, even in patients with mild respiratory symptoms.
[01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:31.829]  You hear all this stuff about long COVID, and COVID does this, COVID makes your penis shrink, and COVID makes you lose hair, and COVID makes you have brain damage, and all this stuff.
[01:45:31.909 --> 01:45:44.900]  And I understand the immediate reaction to all of this, which I tend to have as well, which is, hey, we've been lied to so much about COVID.
[01:45:45.381 --> 01:45:47.423]  You've done so much fear-mongering over COVID.
[01:45:47.683 --> 01:45:48.804]  I don't believe any of this crap.
[01:45:50.816 --> 01:45:53.517]  So part of me says, oh, brain damage from COVID?
[01:45:55.458 --> 01:45:57.498]  Probably just fear-mongering BS like everything else.
[01:45:58.058 --> 01:45:59.219]  But see, here's the problem.
[01:46:00.139 --> 01:46:05.341]  And this is why I say it's the same energy as COVID did this, COVID did this, no, the government did this.
[01:46:06.541 --> 01:46:18.025]  Let's say everything they tell you about COVID is true in regards to long COVID or brain damage or penis shrinkage or all this other stuff they tell you.
[01:46:18.485 --> 01:46:19.466]  Let's say it's all true.
[01:46:19.546 --> 01:46:23.373]   Well, again, COVID was made in a lab.
[01:46:24.313 --> 01:46:26.574]  It's a man-made virus.
[01:46:27.894 --> 01:46:43.799]  So if you're going to be talking about how this virus acts differently than every other virus known in human history, and you're going to be talking about all these horrific long-term effects, and that's why you can't get it, and that's why you should always wear the mask, and never leave your house again, and all this other stuff.
[01:46:43.879 --> 01:46:44.159]  Okay.
[01:46:45.380 --> 01:46:49.401]  Well, then why aren't we mad at the people that created and released this on us?
[01:46:51.226 --> 01:46:53.888]  So what is the breakdown here?
[01:46:53.908 --> 01:46:54.629]  What is the boiled out?
[01:46:56.090 --> 01:47:02.215]  The frustration is not placing blame and responsibility where it belongs.
[01:47:03.396 --> 01:47:04.037]  That's what it is.
[01:47:06.018 --> 01:47:14.544]  Blaming COVID for the kids wearing masks, blaming COVID for school closures, business closures, all this other stuff, that is not the proper blame.
[01:47:14.584 --> 01:47:16.366]  That's a 0% accuracy right there.
[01:47:16.666 --> 01:47:19.008]  Blaming COVID for any of it, 0% accuracy.
[01:47:19.208 --> 01:47:19.608]  Zero.
[01:47:20.269 --> 01:47:24.292]  Blaming the government and the corporations and everybody, 100% accuracy.
[01:47:26.445 --> 01:47:28.206]  But what do you get from the media and your politicians?
[01:47:28.246 --> 01:47:29.306]  They say COVID's to blame.
[01:47:29.586 --> 01:47:31.627]  COVID has 0% responsibility.
[01:47:32.047 --> 01:47:39.609]  The government actors and the corporate actors that foisted all the COVID madness upon us, they bear 100% possibility.
[01:47:39.949 --> 01:47:44.950]  If I try to go get on an airplane right now, is a virus gonna pop up and tell me to wear a mask?
[01:47:45.231 --> 01:47:45.731]  No.
[01:47:46.391 --> 01:47:48.832]  Is some airline attendant gonna tell me to wear a mask?
[01:47:49.232 --> 01:47:49.912]  Yes.
[01:47:52.353 --> 01:47:53.173]  So it's the same thing.
[01:47:54.842 --> 01:47:59.465]  Oh, COVID is causing long-term problems and brain damage and all this stuff.
[01:47:59.505 --> 01:48:00.585]  Okay, well, who's responsible?
[01:48:00.945 --> 01:48:03.347]  Who made the virus?
[01:48:03.987 --> 01:48:06.148]  Who released the virus?
[01:48:06.969 --> 01:48:08.730]  So it's all this fear-mongering.
[01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:20.656]  If you get COVID, your penis is gonna shrink and you're gonna have brain damage so that you're scared to death forever, you never take the mask off, you never give control of your life or take control of your life back from the government.
[01:48:20.676 --> 01:48:23.738]  You give it to them permanently in this state of perma-fear.
[01:48:24.895 --> 01:48:29.236]  And then you never blame the parties responsible, the individuals that made it in a lab.
[01:48:29.516 --> 01:48:46.762]  So just remember this, when they tell you stories about long COVID and lung damage and brain damage and genital damage and all this stuff, thanks Anthony Fauci and Peter Daszak and everybody else that knew that this came in a lab and funded this research in a lab.
[01:48:47.882 --> 01:48:51.443]  And it's just, oh, fear over COVID, oh my gosh, oh, COVID does this, COVID does that.
[01:48:52.418 --> 01:48:55.899]  Well, why aren't you holding the people responsible that made COVID?
[01:48:56.659 --> 01:48:58.659]  The frustration is gonna go on, I'm sure.
[01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:05.001]  And then, there's the vaccines, which are also killing people.
[01:49:05.581 --> 01:49:08.282]  Killing more people than they help, and it's not even close, by the way.
[01:49:09.902 --> 01:49:18.124]  So, again, I don't want to be the person that sees every story and says, oh, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, but it's a fair argument.
[01:49:19.275 --> 01:49:19.975]  Like when I see this.
[01:49:20.435 --> 01:49:25.958]  Doctors stunned by baby born with two heads, three hands, and one torso.
[01:49:26.958 --> 01:49:28.339]  So obviously the debate is raging.
[01:49:28.399 --> 01:49:29.479]  Was the mother vaccinated?
[01:49:30.719 --> 01:49:32.720]  But you're not allowed to ask that question.
[01:49:32.760 --> 01:49:34.201]  You're not allowed to get that answer.
[01:49:34.641 --> 01:49:37.522]  You just see this baby that you just feel so bad for it.
[01:49:38.563 --> 01:49:39.523]  Just a total mutant.
[01:49:40.283 --> 01:49:41.104]  A mutant baby.
[01:49:42.004 --> 01:49:47.006]  And yeah, if we start seeing more of this pop up, I think it's pretty fair to say it's probably the vaccines.
[01:49:48.339 --> 01:49:50.800]  But you'll never get that fair and open debate.
[01:49:51.481 --> 01:49:52.902]  You'll never, you'll never get that.
[01:49:53.702 --> 01:49:55.023]  Here's another example last night.
[01:49:55.363 --> 01:49:57.805]  I saw this in live time, I remember texting my friends.
[01:49:58.265 --> 01:50:05.409]  Final four, basketball game, North Carolina player holds chest, can't catch breath, sinks to floor, throws up in final minutes.
[01:50:05.489 --> 01:50:16.536]  Now, I remember watching this, and this individual player started grasping at his heart and his chest about 60 seconds before he fell over.
[01:50:17.472 --> 01:50:19.274]  And if you go back and watch the game, you can do this.
[01:50:19.594 --> 01:50:22.676]  And it's just stunning how unobservant people are when dealing with this.
[01:50:22.757 --> 01:50:23.717]  This is the aftermath.
[01:50:24.018 --> 01:50:26.700]  That was about 60 seconds after he was grabbing his heart.
[01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:36.749]  He grabbed at his heart two possessions before that, and up and down the court twice on two possessions was grabbing his heart, and then he keels over and starts vomiting.
[01:50:38.356 --> 01:50:41.658]  They said he had the wind knocked out of him.
[01:50:41.738 --> 01:50:43.258]  Folks, I've played sports my whole life.
[01:50:43.579 --> 01:50:45.199]  I've had wind knocked out of me plenty of times.
[01:50:45.780 --> 01:50:48.921]  Everybody knows when you get the wind knocked out of you, that's it.
[01:50:49.081 --> 01:50:53.463]  You're on the floor, you can't breathe, and you need at least 60 seconds to get your wind back.
[01:50:53.503 --> 01:50:56.225]  You're certainly not running up and down the court for two possessions.
[01:50:56.725 --> 01:51:01.007]  I've never seen anybody vomit from having the wind knocked out of them either.
[01:51:01.067 --> 01:51:05.890]   Now, maybe that could have happened, but Clearly this kid had something going on in his chest.
[01:51:05.950 --> 01:51:07.091]  He was pointing to his chest.
[01:51:07.131 --> 01:51:08.312]  He was grabbing his chest.
[01:51:08.713 --> 01:51:14.618]  It wasn't he had the air knocked out of him, but that's just what they say because you can't ask about the vaccines and the heart problems.
[01:51:15.999 --> 01:51:30.451]  Let's say I released a billion mosquitoes in Texas that were known to cause seizures if you got bit by it.
[01:51:33.018 --> 01:51:42.345]  And then all of a sudden in Texas, you had all of these seizure events happening, numbers of seizure events skyrocketing in Texas.
[01:51:42.826 --> 01:51:44.407]  Well, it'd be pretty obvious, wouldn't it?
[01:51:44.447 --> 01:51:49.331]  You'd say, okay, had you been bitten by this mosquito any time recently?
[01:51:49.351 --> 01:51:50.812]  Have you had a mosquito bite any time recently?
[01:51:51.172 --> 01:51:51.592]  Oh, yes.
[01:51:51.632 --> 01:51:54.194]  It's like, okay, I think your seizure may have something to do with it.
[01:51:54.975 --> 01:51:55.756]  That's common sense.
[01:51:56.436 --> 01:51:59.298]  But when it comes to the vaccine, oh, no, no, no.
[01:52:00.399 --> 01:52:02.381]  No, you don't get to ask that.
[01:52:03.496 --> 01:52:05.579]  So it's like, okay, known side effects of the vaccine.
[01:52:05.619 --> 01:52:06.940]  Blood clots, heart problems.
[01:52:06.981 --> 01:52:09.844]  It's like, oh wow, a lot of these people are having blood clots and heart problems.
[01:52:10.505 --> 01:52:12.588]  Don't ask about the vaccine, though!
[01:52:12.608 --> 01:52:16.673]  Like, oh yeah, kids have always had blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:52:16.693 --> 01:52:18.475]  That's been a normal thing, is what they say.
[01:52:19.897 --> 01:52:20.938]  Clearly it's the vaccine.
[01:52:22.256 --> 01:52:25.218]  Uh, let me just try to get as much of this news off my desk as possible.
[01:52:25.238 --> 01:52:27.199]  I'm probably not even going to have time for all of it or these clips.
[01:52:27.899 --> 01:52:34.002]  Exclusive, Army Captain placed in mental hospital for accusing Commanding General Patrick Donahue of pushing a legal vaccine.
[01:52:34.262 --> 01:52:34.362]  Oh!
[01:52:35.463 --> 01:52:39.845]  Army Captain put in mental hospital because he believes in medical freedom.
[01:52:40.605 --> 01:52:42.306]  This country is so evil.
[01:52:43.367 --> 01:52:45.668]  Just so evil that this goes on here.
[01:52:46.228 --> 01:52:50.651]  Federal judge blocks Air Force on giving punishment for members who refuse to take COVID-19 vaccines.
[01:52:52.864 --> 01:52:54.188]  So that's a judge in Cincinnati.
[01:52:55.290 --> 01:53:00.284]  Good for him, but oh, so one judge does the right thing, but then an army captain...
[01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:07.063]  Correctly calls it an illegal vaccine mandate, and he's told he needs to be placed in a mental institution.
[01:53:07.083 --> 01:53:12.345]  That's a Chinese-style re-education camp right here for our army members in America.
[01:53:12.985 --> 01:53:17.488]  Mother who confronted New York City Mayor Adams over toddler mask mandate fired from city job.
[01:53:18.068 --> 01:53:18.208]  Oh!
[01:53:18.648 --> 01:53:23.590]  And I love it, New York's like, move to New York, we believe in free speech because we say gay.
[01:53:24.011 --> 01:53:25.351]  Oh, you criticize the mayor?
[01:53:25.511 --> 01:53:26.272]  You're fired!
[01:53:27.873 --> 01:53:28.693]  These are evil people.
[01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:34.152]  It's beyond any shadow of a doubt that the vaccines are causing large numbers of deaths.
[01:53:34.352 --> 01:53:36.953]  That is the latest from Dr. Peter McCullough.
[01:53:38.794 --> 01:53:39.834]  Indeed, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:40.855 --> 01:53:49.139]  Moving on, the Democrats and the Republicans are going to confirm a pedophile-protecting judge.
[01:53:50.359 --> 01:53:57.801]   To put it another way, if you were a pedophile and you ended up in a courtroom, And you saw that Contengie Brown Jackson was on the bench.
[01:53:58.241 --> 01:53:59.121]  You're feeling good.
[01:53:59.161 --> 01:53:59.942]  You're celebrating.
[01:53:59.962 --> 01:54:01.042]  Your lawyers are celebrating.
[01:54:01.082 --> 01:54:02.362]  You know you're going to get a light sentence.
[01:54:02.402 --> 01:54:05.123]  The pedophile protector is there on the bench.
[01:54:06.343 --> 01:54:10.625]  Politico deletes tweet claiming Judge Jackson will be first black Supreme Court justice.
[01:54:10.785 --> 01:54:11.865]  Isn't that hilarious?
[01:54:12.265 --> 01:54:20.444]   They literally claimed that Jackson would have been the first black Supreme Court Justice, ignoring Judge Clarence Thomas.
[01:54:20.604 --> 01:54:22.666]  Because that's how their mind works, folks.
[01:54:23.406 --> 01:54:25.448]  These people are mentally ill.
[01:54:26.229 --> 01:54:33.374]  They don't count Justice Clarence Thomas as the first black Supreme Court Justice because he's not a deranged, mentally ill, leftist liberal.
[01:54:34.315 --> 01:54:35.075]  I'm telling you this.
[01:54:35.116 --> 01:54:39.059]  You need to understand this about the race-baiting liberal movement right now.
[01:54:39.559 --> 01:54:40.940]  It's not about skin color.
[01:54:41.260 --> 01:54:42.661]  It's all about politics.
[01:54:43.581 --> 01:54:47.244]  They love to use tokenism for their political agenda.
[01:54:48.025 --> 01:54:52.449]  But if you're black or you're this or you're that and you don't support their agenda, then you don't count.
[01:54:53.170 --> 01:54:54.351]  Including Clarence Thomas.
[01:54:55.031 --> 01:54:57.734]  And they just showed you their hand with that story on Politico.
[01:54:58.354 --> 01:54:59.816]  It has nothing to do with skin color, folks.
[01:54:59.856 --> 01:55:01.117]  It's all about politics.
[01:55:01.417 --> 01:55:01.757]  All of it.
[01:55:02.898 --> 01:55:09.725]  It's the same reason why I can't go walk into a girl's bathroom or a girl's locker room at the gym because I'm not a liberal.
[01:55:10.509 --> 01:55:15.011]  But if I was a good liberal and I said, I'm a woman, I'm going into the woman's room, then I'd be fine.
[01:55:15.652 --> 01:55:18.873]  Doesn't matter, I don't have to shave, I don't have to chop off my ding-a-ling, anything.
[01:55:18.913 --> 01:55:19.874]  I mean, I just go right in.
[01:55:20.314 --> 01:55:21.895]  I say, I'm a good progressive liberal!
[01:55:22.435 --> 01:55:23.256]  I'm a woman now!
[01:55:23.276 --> 01:55:26.097]  I go in the woman's locker room, I go shower with them, and it's all good.
[01:55:26.437 --> 01:55:30.399]  But no, because I'm not a brainwashed liberal, I couldn't do that.
[01:55:30.639 --> 01:55:33.001]  That's nothing to do with science or anything.
[01:55:33.951 --> 01:55:34.712]  It's always politics.
[01:55:35.212 --> 01:55:39.638]  Contengie Brown Jackson shows leniency even in baby sex torture cases.
[01:55:39.678 --> 01:55:42.961]  Yeah, they're torturing little children, little babies.
[01:55:43.442 --> 01:55:48.448]  These cases end up on Judge Jackson's desk and she gives them a tiny little slap on the wrist.
[01:55:50.570 --> 01:56:06.335]  I've dealt with worse punishment for what I've done, an innocent man, a political prisoner, I've dealt with worse punishment and I've gone through more torture than pedophiles and child sex abusers have, whose cases ended up on Judge Jackson's bench.
[01:56:06.695 --> 01:56:07.355]  Think about that.
[01:56:07.835 --> 01:56:08.736]  Actually, probably don't.
[01:56:08.796 --> 01:56:09.376]  It's pretty sad.
[01:56:09.556 --> 01:56:10.696]  It's pretty painful to think about.
[01:56:12.257 --> 01:56:12.877]  But it's the truth.
[01:56:15.393 --> 01:56:16.014]  Moving on.
[01:56:16.454 --> 01:56:18.656]  An organized crime perpetrated on Americans.
[01:56:18.816 --> 01:56:24.301]  Experts claim in testimony at least 4.8 million ballots trafficked in the 2020 election.
[01:56:25.002 --> 01:56:25.242]  Mm-hmm.
[01:56:27.624 --> 01:56:31.247]  I mean, seriously, how many illegal votes did Biden get to get to, what, 83 million?
[01:56:31.307 --> 01:56:32.028]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:56:32.989 --> 01:56:34.450]  Give me a break.
[01:56:35.342 --> 01:56:42.764]  Democrats implicated Georgia ballot traffickers were using Democrat officials' offices as stopping points during ballot drop runs.
[01:56:43.144 --> 01:56:49.085]  And remember, in the Wisconsin hearing, they actually got the information.
[01:56:50.705 --> 01:57:01.628]  So they found, I believe it was 14 individuals, and they did it in Georgia too, but they found the individuals who were going to ballot drop boxes multiple times a day.
[01:57:02.827 --> 01:57:16.124]  And they were able to locate their device to track their movements, and they were going to multiple ballot drop boxes every day, going to Democrat Party headquarters every day, and it also just so happens they were at the riots in Kenosha as well.
[01:57:18.601 --> 01:57:23.465]  Hundreds of suspects filmed stuffing multiple ballots into Pennsylvania County drop boxes.
[01:57:24.245 --> 01:57:25.086]  Republican D.A.
[01:57:25.126 --> 01:57:28.488]  won't prosecute any of these suspects because not everyone has been identified.
[01:57:28.508 --> 01:57:31.291]  So, I mean, folks, they're on tape.
[01:57:31.671 --> 01:57:32.972]  They're on camera stealing the election.
[01:57:33.012 --> 01:57:33.832]  I mean, it's just a joke.
[01:57:33.852 --> 01:57:35.914]  I mean, come on, man.
[01:57:36.474 --> 01:57:39.357]  Do we really have to explain that Biden didn't get 83 million votes?
[01:57:39.917 --> 01:57:41.218]  The guy that didn't even campaign?
[01:57:41.038 --> 01:57:43.038]  the guy that couldn't even have a debate.
[01:57:43.038 --> 01:57:51.848]   President Trump requests Clinton judge who was assigned to oversee his Russiagate lawsuit against Hillary Clinton be
[01:57:51.848 --> 01:57:52.477]  removed.
[01:57:52.529 --> 01:57:53.549]  Oh no, no, no, no, no.
[01:57:53.990 --> 01:57:57.552]  That Clinton judge is going to make sure that Trump does not get a fair case.
[01:57:59.073 --> 01:57:59.594]  Believe me.
[01:58:00.795 --> 01:58:01.775]  Believe me.
[01:58:02.796 --> 01:58:07.580]  Final suspect in Detroit-based multi-million dollar credit card fraud ring sentenced to prison.
[01:58:08.660 --> 01:58:11.122]  Have you guys noticed that this is happening more and more?
[01:58:12.183 --> 01:58:13.144]  Credit card fraud.
[01:58:13.384 --> 01:58:23.966]   I have now, for the third time this year, My credit card, or my debit card rather, has been involved in what they call a mass compromise event.
[01:58:24.707 --> 01:58:25.648]  Third time this year!
[01:58:28.510 --> 01:58:33.273]  But we should all have the government-run digital currency because it's really safe, you know.
[01:58:33.914 --> 01:58:34.955]  It's really safe.
[01:58:36.576 --> 01:58:40.059]  Police arrest 26-year-old suspect over Sacramento mass shooting.
[01:58:40.079 --> 01:58:41.140]  Did you hear about this one?
[01:58:42.300 --> 01:58:43.321]  Didn't hear about that one, did ya?
[01:58:43.882 --> 01:58:44.942]  Mass shooting in...
[01:58:46.328 --> 01:58:47.389]  California yesterday?
[01:58:47.409 --> 01:58:48.350]  Any news on it?
[01:58:48.971 --> 01:58:50.072]  Any big stories about it?
[01:58:50.813 --> 01:58:51.053]  No.
[01:58:52.375 --> 01:58:52.595]  No.
[01:58:54.698 --> 01:58:55.779]  Oh, there's one in Dallas, too!
[01:58:56.259 --> 01:58:58.302]  By the way, six people died in the one in California.
[01:58:59.363 --> 01:59:00.484]  Did you hear any news about that?
[01:59:00.524 --> 01:59:01.686]  Did they make a big story about that?
[01:59:01.746 --> 01:59:02.527]  No, they didn't, did they?
[01:59:03.499 --> 01:59:10.043]  Because there's never any consistency from our media because they're just a bunch of liars that have an agenda.
[01:59:11.223 --> 01:59:13.465]  The southern border is just absolutely wide open, folks.
[01:59:13.745 --> 01:59:14.525]  It's really incredible.
[01:59:14.705 --> 01:59:17.507]  I'm talking to a couple of journalists that are on the ground down there.
[01:59:17.727 --> 01:59:18.968]  It's kind of penetrating the news.
[01:59:19.668 --> 01:59:22.009]  Word is out around the world the U.S.
[01:59:22.029 --> 01:59:22.930]  border is wide open.
[01:59:23.948 --> 01:59:26.109]  And Ben Bergquam and others are down there reporting.
[01:59:26.149 --> 01:59:27.450]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:59:28.191 --> 01:59:30.112]  It's just this country is under complete attack.
[01:59:30.832 --> 01:59:33.714]  Like the inflation, which is just crushing people.
[01:59:35.115 --> 01:59:37.136]  Going to record highs, continuing to rise.
[01:59:37.156 --> 01:59:41.719]  20 facts about the emerging global food shortage that should chill you to the core.
[01:59:41.779 --> 01:59:48.163]  Yeah, they're bringing in all these people into America that you're going to be forced to feed while there's a food shortage.
[01:59:49.373 --> 01:59:53.056]  And plus your inflation, I mean you are getting broken right now.
[01:59:53.856 --> 01:59:59.700]  America is having its back broken right now by the Biden administration and the globalists.
[02:00:00.121 --> 02:00:03.463]  I mean it's just total crushing of America right now.
[02:00:04.524 --> 02:00:06.725]  Days at or worse than 56% disapproval.
[02:00:09.229 --> 02:00:14.431]  For their entire terms, Biden already has the record, and he hasn't even finished one term yet.
[02:00:15.311 --> 02:00:18.172]  With 125 days lower than 56% disapproval.
[02:00:18.392 --> 02:00:21.674]  That's much worse than Trump, who had the entire media lying about him all day, too.
[02:00:22.714 --> 02:00:24.835]  Here's rich liberal Democrat Shannon Sharp.
[02:00:25.415 --> 02:00:28.036]  I'd rather pay 20 bucks a gallon than have Trump in office.
[02:00:29.226 --> 02:00:33.069]  But then he can be seen complaining about high gas prices just ten years ago.
[02:00:33.910 --> 02:00:35.731]  Another liberal that owns himself.
[02:00:35.911 --> 02:00:36.872]  Because that's what they do.
[02:00:36.892 --> 02:00:41.676]  Because modern-day liberals are frauds, phonies, and liars.
[02:00:41.936 --> 02:00:43.438]  How many times does this have to be proven?
[02:00:45.299 --> 02:00:47.121]  Alright, let's continue here with the news coverage.
[02:00:47.481 --> 02:00:53.166]  And if I can get all the news off my desk, I'll play some of these video clips in the next segment before Wayne Allyn Root takes over.
[02:00:54.625 --> 02:01:05.054]  So what do you do if you're the Democrats and your popularity is plunging and your approval rating is plunging everywhere and everybody knows how evil-lying scum, what evil-lying scum you are?
[02:01:05.555 --> 02:01:09.038]  Chicago to provide free gas and transit cards.
[02:01:09.098 --> 02:01:13.241]  So now this is California and Illinois that have the highest deficit spending rates.
[02:01:13.261 --> 02:01:18.946]  The states are actually broke with all their giveaways and Democrat financial policy.
[02:01:19.927 --> 02:01:21.008]  Just crushing these states.
[02:01:21.308 --> 02:01:22.749]  But what are they going to do as they're dead broke?
[02:01:22.769 --> 02:01:26.452]  They're giving things away because nobody likes them.
[02:01:27.353 --> 02:01:27.913]  That's what you do.
[02:01:27.993 --> 02:01:29.694]  Nobody likes you, you just give things away.
[02:01:30.795 --> 02:01:35.399]  Massive nationwide campaign to take on Nancy Pelosi and insider trading by Congress.
[02:01:37.048 --> 02:01:40.512]  Kevin Freeman, host of Economic War Room, on the blaze.
[02:01:40.612 --> 02:01:42.394]  Oh, another war room that took our name?
[02:01:42.434 --> 02:01:43.054]  That's hilarious.
[02:01:43.915 --> 02:01:48.720]  Launched a national campaign slamming Pelosi for protecting corrupt insider trading by members of Congress.
[02:01:49.541 --> 02:01:52.384]  Almost two million emails have already been sent to Congress.
[02:01:52.725 --> 02:01:59.592]  You know, nothing will ever probably be done about that until we get new leaders elected, but it's at least something to let Congress know where we stand on it.
[02:02:01.227 --> 02:02:04.668]  Uh, more of the timeless propaganda for the Illuminati here.
[02:02:05.248 --> 02:02:11.170]  Maskless Kamala Harris poses for photos with masked children during visit to DC Elementary School.
[02:02:11.210 --> 02:02:13.170]  Now, I've explained why they do this, folks.
[02:02:14.211 --> 02:02:15.231]  I'll try to make it brief.
[02:02:15.751 --> 02:02:23.893]  You say, why do these political leaders go and take their mask off and pose for pictures with everybody else wearing their mask on?
[02:02:24.414 --> 02:02:27.955]  It's a symbol of dominance, is what it is.
[02:02:28.015 --> 02:02:29.375]  It's an act of dominance.
[02:02:31.178 --> 02:02:47.343]  So that a hundred years from now, just like you can look at photos from a hundred years ago during the Spanish flu pandemic, and you'll see the elites not wearing masks, people in suits and ties not wearing masks, and then everyone else around them in hazmat suits, it's the same thing.
[02:02:47.644 --> 02:02:49.724]  They're marking their territory.
[02:02:50.365 --> 02:02:52.405]  They're displaying their dominance.
[02:02:52.905 --> 02:02:57.387]  So that when they run the same gamut in 50 or 100 years, they can show their agents, see?
[02:02:57.907 --> 02:02:58.907]  We run this stuff.
[02:02:59.668 --> 02:03:00.288]  We do this.
[02:03:01.445 --> 02:03:02.666]  Here we did it in the 20s.
[02:03:02.986 --> 02:03:04.767]  Here we did it in the 2020s.
[02:03:05.367 --> 02:03:08.089]  We dominate this planet.
[02:03:09.150 --> 02:03:13.733]  You are now slave owners and all those around you wearing the mask are your slaves.
[02:03:14.093 --> 02:03:15.254]  And that's how they promote themselves.
[02:03:17.298 --> 02:03:19.879]  That's how they mark their territory, in a timeless fashion.
[02:03:20.639 --> 02:03:22.580]  Another has left Kamala Harris' staff.
[02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:25.381]  The Deputy Chief of Staff quits.
[02:03:25.601 --> 02:03:29.483]  Eleventh aide to leave Kamala Harris' staff.
[02:03:29.643 --> 02:03:30.743]  Yeah, these people suck.
[02:03:30.803 --> 02:03:31.724]  No one wants to work for them.
[02:03:31.804 --> 02:03:37.666]  And it's now considered a blithe on your resume, or a blight, rather, on your resume, rather than a good thing.
[02:03:38.266 --> 02:03:44.167]  Confused puppet Joe Biden ends speech, asks handlers what to do now, and then creeps on a little girl.
[02:03:44.187 --> 02:03:45.007]  Well, that's what he does.
[02:03:45.027 --> 02:03:47.168]  There he is right there, getting up in that little girl's face.
[02:03:48.028 --> 02:03:48.948]  Because he's the creepo.
[02:03:49.568 --> 02:03:51.188]  His daughter wrote about it in his diary.
[02:03:51.828 --> 02:03:54.929]  How he would get in the shower with her and be inappropriate.
[02:03:54.969 --> 02:03:56.349]  I mean, you know, this is the Biden's after all.
[02:03:56.649 --> 02:03:57.630]  In fact, let's go here.
[02:03:57.670 --> 02:04:00.270]  Here's another confused Biden in clip 9.
[02:04:00.590 --> 02:04:01.970]  I mean, this is a joke!
[02:04:02.010 --> 02:04:03.991]  The guy doesn't even know where he is, doesn't even know who he is.
[02:04:04.051 --> 02:04:11.051]  Here's another example in clip 9.
[02:04:11.051 --> 02:04:12.051]  we do now. [applause]
[02:04:12.455 --> 02:04:15.497]  What do we do now?
[02:04:15.837 --> 02:04:17.598]  He has no idea.
[02:04:17.658 --> 02:04:18.759]  Look at him running around.
[02:04:18.779 --> 02:04:20.020]  He had no idea what's going on.
[02:04:21.021 --> 02:04:22.281]  That's the president they sent.
[02:04:23.482 --> 02:04:26.184]  Biden tells bizarre story about Big Mama.
[02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:28.841]  And how he used to drive an 18-wheeler.
[02:04:29.561 --> 02:04:31.402]  Biden has never driven an 18-wheeler.
[02:04:31.542 --> 02:04:32.743]  It's not an easy thing to do.
[02:04:32.803 --> 02:04:33.663]  You need training.
[02:04:33.763 --> 02:04:34.504]  He's never done it.
[02:04:34.604 --> 02:04:35.404]  He just lies.
[02:04:35.444 --> 02:04:40.407]  He lies about, remember his Amtrak story that he's lied about like five times now, that even he's been caught lying about it?
[02:04:41.267 --> 02:04:43.208]  The guy he claims said this to him has been dead?
[02:04:43.228 --> 02:04:46.510]  I mean, this is, the guy's in, but he has dementia.
[02:04:46.530 --> 02:04:48.391]  He doesn't even know where he is half the time.
[02:04:48.451 --> 02:04:50.672]  He's got crap running down his leg half the day.
[02:04:52.864 --> 02:04:56.966]  Joe Biden takes a knee in official photo with sailors for some reason.
[02:04:57.046 --> 02:04:58.467]  Nobody knows why he took the knee.
[02:04:58.687 --> 02:04:59.307]  Not even him.
[02:04:59.407 --> 02:05:03.850]  He just... Photo shoot, posing with people in the Navy, just decided, I'm gonna take a knee.
[02:05:04.410 --> 02:05:07.411]  Hey, the George Floyd thing was two years ago, Joe.
[02:05:07.551 --> 02:05:08.192]  Or more now.
[02:05:08.852 --> 02:05:09.913]  But he takes the knee.
[02:05:11.453 --> 02:05:12.554]  Hunter becomes the hunted.
[02:05:12.594 --> 02:05:16.776]  Senator Grassley warns of national security concerns surrounding Biden crime family.
[02:05:17.096 --> 02:05:19.938]  Says new revelations will be presented to Senate this week.
[02:05:21.512 --> 02:05:23.293]  We'll see how that goes.
[02:05:23.533 --> 02:05:28.055]  Biden seemed to be above the law, and above any media scorn either.
[02:05:29.415 --> 02:05:31.096]  So this is where it all goes, folks.
[02:05:33.277 --> 02:05:34.217]  That's what I said earlier.
[02:05:34.238 --> 02:05:36.919]  You need to understand, this is where it all goes.
[02:05:37.699 --> 02:05:48.263]  So when you ask why this is going on, remind yourself who controls the culture, who controls the education system, and who currently controls the government.
[02:05:48.523 --> 02:05:49.284]  The globalists?
[02:05:50.680 --> 02:05:56.805]  And the radical left-wingers that are destroying our culture, destroying our country, and destroying our people.
[02:05:57.986 --> 02:05:58.727]  They did this.
[02:05:58.947 --> 02:06:06.033]  All of their logic or illogic, all of their propaganda, all of their culture, all of it is destructive and deadly.
[02:06:06.353 --> 02:06:06.974]  And they know it.
[02:06:07.034 --> 02:06:07.814]  They're a death cult.
[02:06:08.495 --> 02:06:10.397]  So you want to know why you see stories like this?
[02:06:10.897 --> 02:06:24.415]   Look no further than the left, the radical, communist, progressive, sycophant, pedophile left, Controlling culture, controlling the education system, this is what you get.
[02:06:26.776 --> 02:06:30.338]  Why are so many women in middle ages on antidepressants?
[02:06:30.698 --> 02:06:33.739]  Because the left-wing culture has turned them into mental basket cases.
[02:06:35.420 --> 02:06:41.462]  CDC warns of steep decline in teen mental health because the mentally ill left is indoctrinating them.
[02:06:42.842 --> 02:06:45.543]  The mystifying rise of child suicide.
[02:06:45.643 --> 02:06:57.699]   Again, folks, this is all left-wing culture Destroying people's minds, destroying their psyches, leading them to suicide and antidepressants.
[02:06:57.719 --> 02:06:59.119]  100% the globalist left-wing agenda.
[02:06:59.679 --> 02:07:01.200]  That's why they do the gaslighting.
[02:07:01.520 --> 02:07:03.100]  That's why they tell you men aren't women.
[02:07:03.120 --> 02:07:05.181]  Or men are women, rather.
[02:07:05.261 --> 02:07:08.542]  That's why they tell you men are women, men can get pregnant, men can have periods.
[02:07:08.862 --> 02:07:10.723]  That's why they tell you all this nonsensical stuff.
[02:07:10.763 --> 02:07:17.705]  They want you to go mentally insane so that you then have to go on their killer pills or you just kill yourself.
[02:07:18.365 --> 02:07:25.549]  And that's why the former French intelligence chief is correct, Pierre Brochard, when he says, all multicultural societies are doomed.
[02:07:25.829 --> 02:07:33.994]  The real quote, the real thing is, all diversified, left-wing, liberal, progressive societies are doomed.
[02:07:34.474 --> 02:07:35.755]  That's why America's doomed.
[02:07:37.281 --> 02:07:39.724]  We've gotten away from traditionalism.
[02:07:40.585 --> 02:07:44.509]  We've gotten away from... It's not even about conservatism or anything about it.
[02:07:44.609 --> 02:07:46.511]  It's just... What works?
[02:07:47.332 --> 02:07:48.353]  Traditionalism.
[02:07:50.035 --> 02:07:50.616]  What works?
[02:07:50.676 --> 02:07:52.958]  A man and a woman and the nuclear family.
[02:07:53.675 --> 02:07:57.038]  And a free market society with good, honorable people with integrity.
[02:07:57.338 --> 02:07:58.238]  That works!
[02:07:58.979 --> 02:08:01.061]  The left is anti all of that.
[02:08:01.921 --> 02:08:08.526]  That's why you have mass suicide rates, children's suicide rates, women on antidepressants, women whoring themselves out on the internet.
[02:08:09.807 --> 02:08:15.832]  Because the left engages in stuff like this, where they say, move to New York where you can say gay!
[02:08:17.013 --> 02:08:20.895]  And they're just obsessed with sexualizing the children.
[02:08:21.903 --> 02:08:25.424]  Seattle Museum hosting sex-themed drag camp for children.
[02:08:26.905 --> 02:08:27.625]  Unbelievable.
[02:08:28.605 --> 02:08:34.527]  And they're grooming these children starting at age 12 at this camp on how to be sexual perverts.
[02:08:35.087 --> 02:08:37.128]  So it's not sports camp or arts camp.
[02:08:37.268 --> 02:08:39.889]  No, it's sex camp for kids now.
[02:08:40.689 --> 02:08:42.570]  Sex camp for kids brought to you by liberals.
[02:08:42.590 --> 02:08:46.031]  And you watch, these people will all grow up to be pill-headed suicide people.
[02:08:46.491 --> 02:08:48.312]  Because that's what the left wing does, folks.
[02:08:48.372 --> 02:08:48.892]  They know it.
[02:08:49.012 --> 02:08:51.133]  It's a satanic death cult.
[02:08:52.346 --> 02:08:55.387]  They put this crap up in the classrooms.
[02:08:56.868 --> 02:08:58.028]  How to be gay!
[02:08:58.048 --> 02:09:00.389]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[02:09:00.930 --> 02:09:02.190]  I cannot teach in Florida.
[02:09:02.330 --> 02:09:05.652]  LGBTQ educators fear fallout from new school law.
[02:09:06.684 --> 02:09:13.590]  Following the enactment of what critics call the Don't Say Gay Bill, some LGBTQ teachers have quit the profession altogether, saying they can't teach now.
[02:09:14.271 --> 02:09:15.592]  So what does that tell you, folks?
[02:09:15.632 --> 02:09:16.613]  It tells you everything you already knew.
[02:09:17.234 --> 02:09:19.316]  All they're teaching is their sexual agenda.
[02:09:19.836 --> 02:09:22.018]  All they're teaching is their left-wing indoctrination.
[02:09:22.259 --> 02:09:24.381]  They're not educating children.
[02:09:25.475 --> 02:09:26.936]  They are indoctrinating them.
[02:09:27.156 --> 02:09:28.457]  They are perverting them.
[02:09:28.778 --> 02:09:34.402]  And so Ron DeSantis just simply says, hey, we're not going to teach kids about sex up to fourth grade.
[02:09:34.722 --> 02:09:38.605]  And then all these teachers say, well, I can't teach here anymore because it's all they teach.
[02:09:39.846 --> 02:09:43.790]  The kid gets there at 9 a.m., salutes and prays to a gay flag.
[02:09:44.010 --> 02:09:47.693]  They get lectured about how gay their teacher is for eight hours wearing a mask.
[02:09:47.933 --> 02:09:50.255]  And then they go home with their gay homework assignment.
[02:09:52.677 --> 02:09:58.744]  And so the teachers say, oh, I really don't know how to teach my kids anymore since I can't sexualize them.
[02:10:00.446 --> 02:10:01.287]  Because that's all they do!
[02:10:03.970 --> 02:10:04.470]  The Left.
[02:10:04.931 --> 02:10:10.337]  Student loans should be forgiven because 18-year-olds were too young to fully understand what they were doing.
[02:10:10.397 --> 02:10:11.318]  Society failed them.
[02:10:11.886 --> 02:10:12.306]  Oh, okay.
[02:10:12.967 --> 02:10:13.628]  Also the left.
[02:10:14.128 --> 02:10:15.389]  Kids know their true selves.
[02:10:15.409 --> 02:10:17.671]  Their identity should be affirmed no matter the cost.
[02:10:18.412 --> 02:10:21.014]  Discussion and asking questions are hate crime.
[02:10:21.054 --> 02:10:21.995]  So, yeah.
[02:10:22.135 --> 02:10:26.419]  So, 18-year-olds that get a student loan got preyed upon by society.
[02:10:26.439 --> 02:10:28.481]  They didn't know what they were doing taking out a student loan.
[02:10:28.501 --> 02:10:35.868]  But hey, if you're an 8-year-old kid, you're old enough to be taught how to masturbate and have anal sex and play with sex toys.
[02:10:36.288 --> 02:10:38.010]  Because that's the liberal logic, don't you see?
[02:10:39.437 --> 02:10:43.241]  GOP congressional candidate believes abortion is a human sacrifice to demons.
[02:10:44.082 --> 02:10:48.527]  Tom Reichert, running in Colorado's 7th District, is right.
[02:10:49.488 --> 02:10:57.896]  Parents of high school track star sucker-punched during race are considering lawsuit against attacker after they were stopped from pressing charges by cops.
[02:10:58.277 --> 02:10:59.638]  So, everybody price all the clip.
[02:11:00.472 --> 02:11:03.393]  The guy racing down the track punches out the guy ahead of him.
[02:11:04.073 --> 02:11:06.214]  Just so happened it was a black guy punching a white guy.
[02:11:06.895 --> 02:11:09.436]  And the parents wanted to press an assault charge.
[02:11:09.476 --> 02:11:12.617]  By the way, they let the kid finish the race and win it after he knocked the guy out.
[02:11:12.657 --> 02:11:15.856]  And the police said, "We'll arrest you if you press charges."
[02:11:15.856 --> 02:11:28.457]  [Music]
[02:11:28.457 --> 02:11:34.056]   In December of 2021, InfoWars offered the first in a three-part series,
[02:11:34.056 --> 02:11:37.556]  the 1776 Anti-Tyrant Coin.
[02:11:37.556 --> 02:11:40.056]  And it sold out in 10 days.
[02:11:40.166 --> 02:11:47.752]   And if it wasn't for listeners getting this original, powerful coin, A founding member coin, we would not be on air today.
[02:11:48.173 --> 02:11:55.237]  Now, the second coin, the Liberty Tree coin, is being offered and it will probably sell out in 10 days again.
[02:11:55.597 --> 02:11:57.659]  It certainly needs to, to fund our operation.
[02:11:58.059 --> 02:11:59.660]  It is so historic.
[02:11:59.760 --> 02:12:03.920]   And it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson about the Tree of Liberty being refreshed with the
[02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:06.960]  blood of patriots and tyrants and more.
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:10.960]  See the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com.
[02:12:10.960 --> 02:12:13.220]  It's also at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:12:13.220 --> 02:12:14.220]  It's amazing.
[02:12:14.220 --> 02:12:16.000]  There's only 10,000 of them.
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:19.520]   And as a founding member, if we're able to stay on the air, we're planning something
[02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:24.000]   very, very special for everyone that helps us go to the next level.
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:29.039]   So get your new Tree of Liberty coin while you still can at 1776coin.com.
[02:12:29.039 --> 02:12:33.960]   All right, Wayne Allen Root guest hosting today for the Alex Jones Show.
[02:12:33.969 --> 02:12:34.831]  Great to be on with you.
[02:12:34.851 --> 02:12:37.254]  I see my my shirt collar is a little bit off.
[02:12:38.475 --> 02:12:40.317]  But other than that, all is good.
[02:12:41.258 --> 02:12:42.220]  Guest hosting today.
[02:12:43.249 --> 02:12:46.111]  Uh, for Alex Jones, lots of things to talk about.
[02:12:46.151 --> 02:12:51.834]  First of all, let me mention, for those of you who don't know me, my website is Root4America.com.
[02:12:51.914 --> 02:12:54.535]  Root4America.com.

[02:13:05.941 --> 02:13:09.723]  Eastern, 3 to 6 Pacific Time, 5 to 8 Central Time.
[02:13:10.942 --> 02:13:19.849]  On USA Radio Network and you can find it all at usaradio.com or at my website rootforamerica.com.
[02:13:20.230 --> 02:13:25.474]  Let me run through the biggest stories of the day that I think have the most importance to all of you.
[02:13:26.515 --> 02:13:27.816]  Just turning some lights off here.
[02:13:28.316 --> 02:13:28.737]  There we go.
[02:13:29.277 --> 02:13:29.577]  All right.
[02:13:29.858 --> 02:13:32.320]  So the biggest story is the day that I think have importance to all of you.
[02:13:32.360 --> 02:13:39.826]  Number one, there's a Hunter Biden grand jury going on and the witness was asked about a deal with the big guy.
[02:13:40.518 --> 02:13:42.241]  The big guy, Joe Biden.
[02:13:43.964 --> 02:13:52.399]  And so for the first time, Joe Biden's name has come up in a criminal investigation, an official grand jury criminal investigation.
[02:13:53.098 --> 02:14:07.711]  And don't forget, Hunter Biden has come up, his name in all of the media stories, the New York Times, Washington Post, over the last month, for the first time ever, there was an admission that the Hunter Biden laptop is real.
[02:14:08.291 --> 02:14:14.937]  And I was literally banned for life from Twitter because I brought up Hunter Biden's laptop and the stolen election.
[02:14:15.766 --> 02:14:20.667]  And the censorship and the banning and the book burning of liberals trying to destroy us all.
[02:14:21.187 --> 02:14:24.447]  And Twitter confirmed that I'm right by banning me for life.
[02:14:25.328 --> 02:14:26.768]  And it turned out everything I said was right.
[02:14:26.788 --> 02:14:31.689]  Matter of fact, there were three things I brought up that I felt led to my banning for life from Twitter.
[02:14:31.729 --> 02:14:34.709]  Number one, the election was rigged and stolen in 2020.
[02:14:35.629 --> 02:14:37.830]  Number two, Hunter Biden's laptop was covered up.
[02:14:38.250 --> 02:14:43.951]  And number three, lockdowns are massive failures and did not work in 2020 against COVID.
[02:14:45.663 --> 02:14:51.605]  And all three resulted in suspensions of me by Twitter, and eventually they banned me for life.
[02:14:52.765 --> 02:14:57.907]  So, no question in my mind, I was right on all three, proven right on all three.
[02:14:58.688 --> 02:15:00.968]  But the big news story is Joe Biden's being brought up.
[02:15:01.048 --> 02:15:01.408]  Why?
[02:15:01.849 --> 02:15:06.930]  Why is the Hunter Biden laptop finally being acknowledged as real a year and a half after the election?
[02:15:07.290 --> 02:15:11.112]  Why is Joe Biden's name being brought into a criminal investigation?
[02:15:11.432 --> 02:15:12.952]  Well, number one, because it's all true.
[02:15:13.913 --> 02:15:21.987]   And number two, Because for the first time, the liberal left is realizing that Joe Biden's leading them to a massive defeat.
[02:15:22.643 --> 02:15:24.704]  I mean a landslide massive defeat.
[02:15:24.764 --> 02:15:26.704]  So they're looking to get rid of Joe Biden.
[02:15:27.025 --> 02:15:28.845]  And the first guy in the country said that was me.
[02:15:29.345 --> 02:15:31.206]  Months ago I said Joe Biden's gone.
[02:15:31.726 --> 02:15:35.328]  I made a guess that maybe Hillary Clinton would be the one to somehow replace him.
[02:15:35.348 --> 02:15:36.528]  I'm not sure how they're going to do it.
[02:15:36.948 --> 02:15:43.190]  But they're going to replace Joe Biden and Kamala because Kamala is the most hated human being in the history of the world.
[02:15:43.650 --> 02:15:47.812]  Everybody knows that she's unqualified for the presidency, incompetent.
[02:15:48.332 --> 02:15:50.173]  Incredibly, not bright.
[02:15:50.233 --> 02:15:54.936]  I wanted to say stupid, but I'll try to be nice and just say not a very bright person.
[02:15:55.657 --> 02:15:58.118]  And that she is just disliked by everyone.
[02:15:58.579 --> 02:16:00.340]  I don't know why it took him till now to figure it out.
[02:16:00.760 --> 02:16:03.001]  She's black, half black, half Indian.
[02:16:03.362 --> 02:16:11.687]  And yet in the Democrat primary, where blacks make up a huge portion of the electorate, she got no black votes and had to drop out before the first primary.
[02:16:12.047 --> 02:16:14.509]  She was completely disliked by black Democrat voters.
[02:16:15.189 --> 02:16:23.218]  So why anyone thought she'd make a good VP, I have no idea, but the end result is if the media is on your side, they can lie about anything and everything.
[02:16:23.959 --> 02:16:29.985]  So they're finally acknowledging Hunter and Joe Biden for a specific reason.
[02:16:31.218 --> 02:16:33.059]  Hunter Biden's laptop, for a specific reason.
[02:16:33.119 --> 02:16:34.159]  Hunter Biden's corruption.
[02:16:34.499 --> 02:16:35.780]  And Joe Biden being the big guy.
[02:16:36.100 --> 02:16:37.701]  They gotta get rid of Joe Biden.
[02:16:37.721 --> 02:16:39.301]  They gotta bury Joe Biden.
[02:16:39.321 --> 02:16:41.502]  They gotta throw Grandpa from the train.
[02:16:42.022 --> 02:16:42.622]  Or the plane.
[02:16:42.822 --> 02:16:45.363]  Was that the Sly Stallone movie that was a big bomb?
[02:16:45.704 --> 02:16:48.184]  About 30 years ago, throw Grandpa from the train, I think it was.
[02:16:48.885 --> 02:16:51.926]  And so I'm telling you, Joe Biden needs to be thrown under the bus.
[02:16:52.706 --> 02:17:01.673]  If they have any chance at surviving the midterms and after that, any chance at winning in 2024, the whole country's arrayed against the Democrat Party now.
[02:17:02.113 --> 02:17:03.654]  They've got to get rid of Biden.
[02:17:04.194 --> 02:17:12.240]  And they've got to somehow figure out the game plan to replace him and his vice president because Kamala's incompetent and hated even more than Biden.
[02:17:12.961 --> 02:17:14.141]  All right, we're heading out for a break.
[02:17:14.161 --> 02:17:17.224]  When I get back, I've got a commentary called Defund Disney.
[02:17:17.604 --> 02:17:18.484]  I'll bet you can't wait.
[02:17:18.845 --> 02:17:20.466]  Defund Disney when we get back.
[02:17:21.457 --> 02:17:22.058]  All right, we're back.
[02:17:22.078 --> 02:17:23.379]  Way down the route for Alex Jones.
[02:17:24.500 --> 02:17:26.782]  We jumped in so quickly in segment one.
[02:17:27.223 --> 02:17:29.205]  I was in the process of just getting ready.
[02:17:29.605 --> 02:17:30.526]  Now I'm settled in.
[02:17:30.546 --> 02:17:32.288]  Now I know what I've got to talk about.
[02:17:32.328 --> 02:17:33.609]  So I wanted to jump to Disney.
[02:17:34.532 --> 02:17:38.935]  Joke for the big story about Joe Biden being the big guy and the end of the Joe Biden administration.
[02:17:38.975 --> 02:17:39.775]  It's coming fast.
[02:17:40.396 --> 02:17:42.117]  Fast and furious, as the movie says.
[02:17:42.477 --> 02:17:44.098]  They've got to get rid of Joe Biden.
[02:17:44.498 --> 02:17:47.580]  But let's jump to Disney, because I've never in my life seen anything like this.
[02:17:48.100 --> 02:17:50.161]  You know, I've never been an anti-gay guy.
[02:17:50.562 --> 02:17:52.143]  I've always been a live and let live guy.
[02:17:52.183 --> 02:17:55.945]  I've been a lifelong Republican conservative, but with libertarian leanings.
[02:17:56.585 --> 02:18:11.370]  On some social issues, and as an example, I was the Libertarian Vice Presidential Nominee in 2008, so some of you may not know it, but I was on the ticket in 2008 when McCain ran against Obama, it was Bob Barr and Wayne Alleyroot, and that's me.
[02:18:11.390 --> 02:18:17.152]  And when it comes to gay issues, I'm not pro-gay, I'm not anti-gay, I just say, live and let live!
[02:18:17.632 --> 02:18:19.293]  You wanna be gay, be gay!
[02:18:19.833 --> 02:18:20.673]  You wanna be lesbian?
[02:18:20.813 --> 02:18:21.394]  Be lesbian.
[02:18:21.694 --> 02:18:22.834]  You wanna be transsexual?
[02:18:23.254 --> 02:18:23.794]  It's weird.
[02:18:24.234 --> 02:18:24.895]  It's strange.
[02:18:25.235 --> 02:18:25.995]  It's confused.
[02:18:26.075 --> 02:18:27.135]  I think it's mental illness.
[02:18:27.635 --> 02:18:29.096]  But if you wanna be, be it.
[02:18:29.336 --> 02:18:30.376]  You just changed my screen.
[02:18:30.556 --> 02:18:31.357]  So, there we go.
[02:18:31.677 --> 02:18:32.017]  There we go.
[02:18:32.037 --> 02:18:32.397]  It's back.
[02:18:32.717 --> 02:18:33.717]  Now I can see what I'm looking at.
[02:18:34.338 --> 02:18:35.338]  So, okay.
[02:18:35.778 --> 02:18:36.898]  You wanna be transsexual?
[02:18:37.198 --> 02:18:37.939]  Be transsexual.
[02:18:38.519 --> 02:18:42.420]  But, number one, if it affects me, it's a different story.
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.421]  If it doesn't affect me, if you're gay in your bedroom, I don't see it.
[02:18:45.481 --> 02:18:45.961]  I don't care.
[02:18:45.981 --> 02:18:47.121]  None of my business.
[02:18:47.862 --> 02:18:51.943]   But you have no right First of all, I've always argued about transsexual issues.
[02:18:52.264 --> 02:18:55.845]  You have no right to stuff men down my throat in a women's bathroom.
[02:18:56.206 --> 02:19:00.268]  No right to stuff men down little girls' throats in a locker room setting.
[02:19:00.688 --> 02:19:01.789]  In a sports setting.
[02:19:02.349 --> 02:19:03.730]  On a field trip setting.
[02:19:04.090 --> 02:19:05.030]  Men can't be women.
[02:19:05.391 --> 02:19:06.611]  Little boys can't be girls.
[02:19:07.052 --> 02:19:08.312]  And hang on, my daughters.
[02:19:08.933 --> 02:19:15.176]  And you have no right to take little girls' scholarships away and trophies away when boys start playing girls' sports.
[02:19:15.596 --> 02:19:16.597]  All of that is nuts.
[02:19:17.463 --> 02:19:21.226]  Number two, you have no right to stuff transgenders down the military's throat.
[02:19:21.826 --> 02:19:34.476]  You have no right to say transgenders should be in the military, because if they're in the military, the reason why isn't because they're brave heroes, it's because they want free transgender surgery.
[02:19:34.856 --> 02:19:39.500]  Sex change surgery costs $100,000 to $150,000.
[02:19:40.301 --> 02:19:41.201]  Look at your screen.
[02:19:41.722 --> 02:19:42.502]  Aren't you proud of that?
[02:19:42.842 --> 02:19:44.464]  There's your military dollars in action.
[02:19:45.044 --> 02:19:46.266]  But here's the deal.
[02:19:46.746 --> 02:19:47.947]  You can be what you want to be.
[02:19:47.967 --> 02:19:50.150]  This person can be whoever they want to be.
[02:19:50.570 --> 02:19:52.633]  Strange, weird, to normal people.
[02:19:53.033 --> 02:20:00.161]  But you have no right to take my taxpayer money and have a sex change operation in the military or in prison!
[02:20:00.899 --> 02:20:06.703]  No taxpayer dollars should ever be spent because a person's mixed up and confused what their sexual identity is.
[02:20:07.283 --> 02:20:08.644]  So I'm not anti-gay.
[02:20:09.025 --> 02:20:11.386]  I'm anti all of that, which is ridiculous.
[02:20:11.987 --> 02:20:20.853]  Now along comes this new stuff that I had no idea that our children were being groomed in kindergarten, first grade, second grade, and third grade.
[02:20:21.453 --> 02:20:30.139]  Groomed, literally, to be gay, to be lesbian, to be transgender, to change their sexual identity, and to think that's a good thing.
[02:20:31.559 --> 02:20:35.905]  And I don't believe there's very many parents in America who approve of that, liberal or conservative.
[02:20:36.465 --> 02:20:38.288]  I think the Virginia election proved that.
[02:20:38.588 --> 02:20:44.015]  Well, the mama bears came out and they elected the Republican governor of Virginia that no one thought was possible.
[02:20:44.535 --> 02:20:45.897]  No one thought it was even possible.
[02:20:46.197 --> 02:20:48.961]  Virginia has become not purple, but a blue state.
[02:20:49.481 --> 02:20:51.382]  But yet it turned big-time red.
[02:20:51.723 --> 02:21:06.251]  They elected a Republican governor and an all-Republican legislature over the issues of critical race theory in school, school closures for COVID, masks in school, vaccines in school, and transgender sexual identity education taught in school.
[02:21:06.871 --> 02:21:11.294]  All of that led to all the mothers of Virginia switching to the Republican Party.
[02:21:11.834 --> 02:21:19.321]   So if Democrats want to make this their hill to die on, as the saying goes, Famous saying, and I'm not talking about violence here.
[02:21:19.341 --> 02:21:21.523]  I'm not talking about murdering anybody.
[02:21:21.563 --> 02:21:23.084]  Please don't misconstrue my words.
[02:21:23.584 --> 02:21:26.846]  A hill to die on is one of the most famous sayings in history.
[02:21:27.226 --> 02:21:33.750]  And if Democrats want to make this issue their hill to die on, I'm talking about the political party's death.
[02:21:34.110 --> 02:21:36.832]  I'm talking about their campaigns being destroyed.
[02:21:37.212 --> 02:21:38.753]  Then you make it the hill to die on.
[02:21:39.053 --> 02:21:39.814]  I'm all for it.
[02:21:40.274 --> 02:21:41.074]  I'm cheering you.
[02:21:41.555 --> 02:21:42.835]  I'm going to high five you.
[02:21:43.236 --> 02:21:43.756]  It's great.
[02:21:44.429 --> 02:21:45.712]  Make it the hill to die on!
[02:21:46.073 --> 02:21:49.783]  Make it the centerpiece issue of the Democrat Party!
[02:21:50.726 --> 02:22:07.233]  That transsexuality, transgender identity, changing your sexual identification, gay and lesbian education from kindergarten through third grade should be taught in all the schools.
[02:22:07.573 --> 02:22:10.194]  You do that and you watch what happens in November.
[02:22:10.555 --> 02:22:12.495]  You're going to lose all 50 states.
[02:22:12.876 --> 02:22:16.137]  You're not going to lose 50, 60 seats in a House landslide.
[02:22:16.457 --> 02:22:19.978]  You're going to lose 80 to 100 seats in a House landslide.
[02:22:20.238 --> 02:22:22.499]  You're going to lose the Senate by 10 seats.
[02:22:22.839 --> 02:22:25.140]  You're going to be slaughtered politically.
[02:22:25.440 --> 02:22:26.140]  Destroyed.
[02:22:26.520 --> 02:22:27.261]  Demolished.
[02:22:27.581 --> 02:22:29.061]  The end of the Democrat Party.
[02:22:29.081 --> 02:22:33.923]  Because American parents don't support this kind of mental illness.
[02:22:34.363 --> 02:22:38.064]  They don't support grooming and brainwashing their children.
[02:22:38.745 --> 02:22:44.501]   And so shocking To me, was Disney deciding to get involved in this thing?
[02:22:44.522 --> 02:22:58.756]  And it's interesting because I wrote a book, The Great Patriot Protest, a boycott book, that identifies all the companies in America that take our dollars as conservatives, patriots, Christians, people who love this country and American exceptionalism.
[02:22:59.176 --> 02:23:06.619]  They take our dollars, they get rich, their stocks go up, they make a lot of money, everybody gets rich on us, and then they spit in our faces.
[02:23:07.019 --> 02:23:12.901]  And I identified 116 woke companies that do that and Disney was right at the top of the list.
[02:23:13.320 --> 02:23:19.720]   and I gave you the phone number and the names of Disney CEO and chairman of the board and board of directors
[02:23:19.720 --> 02:23:24.361]   and I give you their email, their phone number, their social media sites and their physical address
[02:23:24.361 --> 02:23:29.120]   for snail mail to go after them, to let them know we're going to boycott them,
[02:23:29.120 --> 02:23:36.101]   never buy from them again and put them out of business with their sick, mentally ill political views.
[02:23:36.101 --> 02:23:37.800]  And Disney's right at the top of the list.
[02:23:37.800 --> 02:23:41.820]   So please check out my book, "Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book."
[02:23:41.820 --> 02:23:45.719]  It's the perfect book for the perfect time to defund Disney.
[02:23:45.719 --> 02:23:49.320]   The worst idea in the history of the world was to defund the police.
[02:23:49.432 --> 02:23:51.213]  And the result is all over the United States.
[02:23:51.734 --> 02:23:55.376]  Blue cities run by Democrats are being destroyed by crime.
[02:23:55.917 --> 02:23:56.757]  Violent crime.
[02:23:57.258 --> 02:23:57.778]  Murders.
[02:23:57.998 --> 02:23:58.559]  Gangs.
[02:23:59.019 --> 02:23:59.760]  Gang rapes.
[02:24:01.081 --> 02:24:01.981]  Carjackings.
[02:24:02.382 --> 02:24:03.402]  Home invasions.
[02:24:04.083 --> 02:24:04.823]  Shoplifting.
[02:24:05.204 --> 02:24:07.806]  Not just shoplifting like I'm grabbing one bottle of soda.
[02:24:07.826 --> 02:24:12.209]  I'm talking, as you all know, gangs of thugs.
[02:24:13.320 --> 02:24:22.146]  Running into stores and with hammers and axes and pickaxes and whatever they've got their hands on.
[02:24:22.546 --> 02:24:23.867]  They're breaking the case.
[02:24:24.207 --> 02:24:36.015]  They're stealing a million dollars in jewelry or they're cleaning out drugstores of $1,500 worth of goods because anything below $1,500 is just a ticket, an appearance ticket or anything below $1,200 or $1,000.
[02:24:36.796 --> 02:24:37.977]  Every city is a different number.
[02:24:38.317 --> 02:24:43.860]   But they basically, all these Democrat cities have legalized crime and they've legalized Shoplifting.
[02:24:44.940 --> 02:24:49.261]  So what's happened is Democrat cities have been just destroyed.
[02:24:49.902 --> 02:24:50.542]  Destroyed.
[02:24:50.982 --> 02:24:51.802]  It's a terrible thing.
[02:24:52.222 --> 02:24:54.443]  And our country is being destroyed by the Democrat Party.
[02:24:54.983 --> 02:24:57.303]  When I get back, we got about, what, two minutes to go?
[02:24:57.943 --> 02:25:07.226]  I'm going to read you Defund, going to read you Defund Disney, my latest commentary, what we've got to do to defund Disney and how wrong they are.
[02:25:07.766 --> 02:25:17.889]   But on the way out here, I want to mention the funniest story of the week, because it involves What Disney believes in, that they've got to stop this new Florida law at all costs.
[02:25:18.169 --> 02:25:28.813]  Disney will put all their prestige and credibility and power and money behind stopping the wonderful new law in Florida by Governor Ron DeSantis that should be the law of the land.
[02:25:29.333 --> 02:25:30.655]  It should not be the law of Florida.
[02:25:30.955 --> 02:25:38.123]  It should be the law of every state in America that you cannot groom and brainwash children between kindergarten and third grade.
[02:25:38.483 --> 02:25:43.969]  And it should be the law you can't brainwash them between kindergarten and 12th grade in all 50 states.
[02:25:44.429 --> 02:25:47.473]  It's not a school's job to say gay is bad.
[02:25:48.113 --> 02:25:50.694]  Transgender is bad, or gay is good.
[02:25:51.154 --> 02:25:52.195]  Transgender is good!
[02:25:52.695 --> 02:25:57.697]  Public schools should stay completely out of politics and religion.
[02:25:58.177 --> 02:25:59.498]  It's none of their business.
[02:25:59.898 --> 02:26:04.480]  It's parents' job to teach children whether gay is good or gay is bad.
[02:26:04.980 --> 02:26:06.161]  None of your business.
[02:26:06.601 --> 02:26:11.423]  And transgenders, kindergartners don't need to know about it, and it shouldn't be taught anymore.
[02:26:11.903 --> 02:26:27.335]   But the mayor, one minute to go, the mayor, Of New York City, Eric Adams, who is supposed to be a moderate Democrat, is now paying for a billboard campaign in Florida that if you don't like how they're treating you as a gay person, please move to New York.
[02:26:27.795 --> 02:26:28.675]  And I'm just laughing.
[02:26:28.715 --> 02:26:34.857]  First of all, there's no parent, no normal parent in America that doesn't like this new law in Florida.
[02:26:35.097 --> 02:26:35.297]  None!
[02:26:35.877 --> 02:26:39.479]  So he's just, it shows that Eric Adams was a liar and a fraud.
[02:26:39.759 --> 02:26:42.001]  He's not a moderate and he has bad taste.
[02:26:42.041 --> 02:26:44.142]  He has no clue what people believe in.
[02:26:44.362 --> 02:26:48.224]  He's on the wrong side of this issue by a mile, by a landslide.
[02:26:48.584 --> 02:27:02.172]  But more importantly, if you live in Florida and you want children to be brainwashed to change their sexual identity like I change a pair of socks, then it's the best thing that ever happened to Florida that all those people who believe that should move to New York.
[02:27:02.612 --> 02:27:03.534]  Good luck to New York!
[02:27:03.914 --> 02:27:04.755]  Goodbye, New York!
[02:27:05.156 --> 02:27:05.877]  Have a nice life!
[02:27:06.357 --> 02:27:08.480]  I'm Wayne Allyn Root, and I'll be right back!
[02:27:08.801 --> 02:27:10.283]  Guest host for Alex Jones today.
[02:27:10.583 --> 02:27:13.347]  Rootforamerica.com, wayneroot at gmail.com.
[02:27:14.309 --> 02:27:14.909]  All right, I'm back.
[02:27:14.949 --> 02:27:17.190]  Wayne Allyn Root, back for segment number three.
[02:27:17.951 --> 02:27:22.393]  Great to be guest host on Tuesdays for the Alex Jones Show on a regular basis.
[02:27:22.433 --> 02:27:27.396]  Thank you, Alex, for a wonderful opportunity to get my views out there to the whole world.
[02:27:27.436 --> 02:27:28.516]  And I know the whole world's watching.
[02:27:28.556 --> 02:27:29.837]  I've mentioned this on your show before.
[02:27:30.637 --> 02:27:32.538]  Years ago, I used to go on Fox News a lot.
[02:27:32.658 --> 02:27:37.100]  I was on a lot of big Fox News shows from Glenn Beck to Sean Hannity to you name it.
[02:27:37.180 --> 02:27:40.042]  All the big names on Fox and Friends in the morning all the time.
[02:27:40.682 --> 02:28:01.663]   And every time I went on, I would get 20 to 30, once in a while as many as 50, texts, emails, and phone calls from friends and fans, many of whom were friends from high school, junior high school, elementary school, who hadn't seen me or spoken to me in years and say, oh my gosh, you're famous!
[02:28:01.743 --> 02:28:03.725]  I just saw Wayne Root on Fox News!
[02:28:03.765 --> 02:28:04.406]  I can't believe it!
[02:28:04.446 --> 02:28:04.786]  You're great!
[02:28:05.532 --> 02:28:06.172]  And I'll be great.
[02:28:06.232 --> 02:28:09.594]  That was the proof to me how powerful Fox News was.
[02:28:10.195 --> 02:28:16.558]  Nothing else I ever went on would get me 30 to 50 people saying, Wayne, I just saw you.
[02:28:17.318 --> 02:28:21.921]  Until I did Alex Jones as guest host and as a guest on Alex Jones.
[02:28:22.541 --> 02:28:27.744]  And suddenly everyone I've ever known in my life comes out of the woodwork and says, I saw you at Alex Jones today.
[02:28:28.416 --> 02:28:41.020]  That just tells you that Alex Jones is kind of the secret passion of so many people in this country who maybe don't brag to everyone in the world they watch him because they're nervous of what people think.
[02:28:41.460 --> 02:28:43.220]  They're nervous to say I'm a Trump fan.
[02:28:43.561 --> 02:28:45.981]  They're nervous to say I'm a Republican or a conservative.
[02:28:46.361 --> 02:28:52.503]  They're nervous to say I don't support transgender education to kindergartners.
[02:28:52.923 --> 02:28:54.564]  They're scared they'll lose their jobs.
[02:28:55.104 --> 02:28:57.046]  And Alex Jones is high up on that list.
[02:28:57.546 --> 02:29:03.291]  They may be scared to tell the world that I watch Alex Jones every day, but they do.
[02:29:03.851 --> 02:29:04.231]  Clearly.
[02:29:04.732 --> 02:29:13.078]  Because I get as many people seeing me on this as I've ever gotten on Fox News or anything else I've ever done in my entire life.
[02:29:13.118 --> 02:29:13.959]  So that's the deal.
[02:29:15.740 --> 02:29:17.442]  Some of the stories that are important out there.
[02:29:17.462 --> 02:29:22.305]  Remember I said at the beginning of the show that I said the election was rigged and stolen in 2020?
[02:29:23.741 --> 02:29:29.665]  And of course the media ignored it and told me I'm a terrible person and I'm a fool and I'm a liar.
[02:29:30.586 --> 02:29:35.049]  So many things came out in the last week that would back up my claims.
[02:29:35.109 --> 02:29:38.871]  First of all, an organized crime was perpetrated on Americans.
[02:29:39.692 --> 02:29:57.415]   Experts on voting fraud testified in Wisconsin in front of the state legislature yesterday and they said an organized crime was perpetrated on Americans At least 4.8 million ballots were trafficked in the 2020 election.
[02:29:59.056 --> 02:30:11.543]  This was Catherine Engelbrecht and Greg Phillips from True the Vote testified in front of the campaign and elections committees in Wisconsin about ballot drop boxes and ballot trafficking.
[02:30:12.383 --> 02:30:13.924]  And they've got the proof.
[02:30:14.679 --> 02:30:20.723]  That there were so many fraudulent, by the millions, ballots trafficked in the United States.
[02:30:21.323 --> 02:30:25.686]  The exact thing I warned about and reported on and said happened is true.
[02:30:26.186 --> 02:30:27.427]  Here's a Pennsylvania story.
[02:30:27.847 --> 02:30:34.031]  Hundreds of suspects filmed stuffing multiple ballots into Pennsylvania County drop boxes.
[02:30:35.772 --> 02:30:36.933]  And they've got them on tape.
[02:30:37.930 --> 02:30:42.652]  So, you know, again, and the stories keep coming up and coming up and coming up.
[02:30:42.672 --> 02:30:43.613]  I have so many in front of me.
[02:30:43.633 --> 02:30:45.794]  I'm trying to find more of them.
[02:30:45.854 --> 02:30:49.996]  Breaking exclusive, the U.S.
[02:30:50.036 --> 02:31:02.923]  Postal Service is withholding investigative report on the whistleblower truck driver who says he hauled 288,000 suspicious ballots across state lines before the 2020 election.
[02:31:04.760 --> 02:31:06.943]  Implicated Democrats in Georgia.
[02:31:07.423 --> 02:31:16.012]  Georgia ballot traffickers were using Democrat officials' offices as their home base during ballot drop runs.
[02:31:16.653 --> 02:31:18.555]  I mean, the list goes on and on.
[02:31:19.016 --> 02:31:20.177]  The election was stolen.
[02:31:23.460 --> 02:31:41.031]  And the number one thing you need to ask every Republican running, for every office in America, in every GOP primary coming up this year, in the coming few weeks and months, is do you believe the 2020 election was rigged and stolen against President Trump?
[02:31:41.632 --> 02:31:49.797]  And any candidate who says no, or who hems and haws, or who talks in a circle and won't give you an answer, knock them out!
[02:31:50.581 --> 02:31:51.402]  Never let him win!
[02:31:51.842 --> 02:31:57.587]  We don't want one candidate running for office as a Republican who won't admit the election was stolen.
[02:31:57.927 --> 02:31:59.809]  And why did they rig and steal the election?
[02:32:00.666 --> 02:32:09.172]  It's happening right now so they can brainwash your children with transgender and with sexual identity education.
[02:32:09.653 --> 02:32:12.715]  And so they can brainwash your children with critical race theory.
[02:32:13.075 --> 02:32:18.279]  And so they can mask us and vaccine mandate us and lock us down for the rest of our lives.
[02:32:18.739 --> 02:32:21.741]  And so they can open the borders and let everyone in.
[02:32:22.162 --> 02:32:24.824]  So no Republican will ever win an election again.
[02:32:25.144 --> 02:32:27.365]  And you change the demographics of America.
[02:32:27.745 --> 02:32:30.825]  So America isn't filled with Americans anymore.
[02:32:30.825 --> 02:32:37.184]   It's filled with foreigners who actually hate America and hate you and want to outvote you
[02:32:37.184 --> 02:32:41.705]   and give themselves welfare for the rest of their lives while you starve and the money
[02:32:41.705 --> 02:32:46.025]   is redistributed from you to them as an American citizen to an illegal alien.
[02:32:46.025 --> 02:32:48.825]  That's why they rigged and stole the election.
[02:32:49.201 --> 02:32:52.603]  And I don't know if even winning big in November will change that.
[02:32:52.943 --> 02:32:54.124]  But sure, we've got to do it.
[02:32:54.504 --> 02:32:57.585]  We have no choice, because the alternative is to lose in November.
[02:32:57.946 --> 02:33:02.648]  If Republicans don't win in a landslide whiteout in November, it's all over.
[02:33:03.188 --> 02:33:04.069]  America's finished.
[02:33:04.569 --> 02:33:06.591]  And America may be finished right now.
[02:33:07.051 --> 02:33:08.332]  May 23rd is the date.
[02:33:08.752 --> 02:33:10.433]  Title 42 will be removed.
[02:33:10.934 --> 02:33:15.096]  And Joe Biden is going to let the entire world overrun America.
[02:33:15.577 --> 02:33:21.381]  And we found out today from Homeland Security leaked documents, this is their plan.
[02:33:21.881 --> 02:33:25.083]  I keep trying to tell you, this is their plan.
[02:33:25.524 --> 02:33:27.465]  I learned it at Columbia University.
[02:33:27.965 --> 02:33:37.875]  I graduated, I was attended Columbia 79 through 83, graduated class of 83 with my supposed classmate, Barack Hussein Obama.
[02:33:39.436 --> 02:33:40.917]  And what did I learn at Columbia?
[02:33:40.978 --> 02:33:41.778]  Cloward-Piven.
[02:33:42.499 --> 02:33:49.766]  Cloward-Piven is a plan to destroy the United States by overwhelming the system with people on welfare.
[02:33:50.402 --> 02:34:08.688]  And they figured out all these years later that if they can't do it with Americans on welfare, they will open the borders and let every foreigner in the world in and destroy America by getting every foreigner, every illegal alien they let in on welfare and food stamps and housing allowances.
[02:34:09.248 --> 02:34:21.656]  And aid to dependent children, and free medical that will wipe us out and destroy our hospitals, and free public schools for their kids that will wipe us out and bankrupt the school system, and give them free college!
[02:34:22.077 --> 02:34:24.598]  Everything free you could ever give them, they'll give them.
[02:34:25.119 --> 02:34:26.139]  Insanity.
[02:34:26.820 --> 02:34:27.420]  Insanity.
[02:34:27.660 --> 02:34:28.221]  What's our time?
[02:34:28.261 --> 02:34:29.061]  How much time we have left?
[02:34:29.081 --> 02:34:29.481]  Minute?
[02:34:30.182 --> 02:34:31.002]  Minute or so?
[02:34:31.062 --> 02:34:32.423]  All right.
[02:34:34.440 --> 02:34:36.123]  Here's another story I got right.
[02:34:36.723 --> 02:34:42.192]  I said that Democrat cities are going to be overwhelmed with crime and homelessness.
[02:34:42.752 --> 02:34:48.441]  Seattle's crime surge spread statewide thanks to Democrats' progressive policies.
[02:34:48.881 --> 02:34:49.663]  What did I tell you?
[02:34:50.223 --> 02:34:57.548]  That George Soros was putting money to elect Democrat district attorneys who are really communists.
[02:34:57.988 --> 02:35:05.013]  And they're going to let every criminal out, even murderers and rapists and violent carjackers and violent home invaders.
[02:35:05.373 --> 02:35:10.697]  And that will lead to a massive surge of crime like nobody has ever seen before.
[02:35:11.077 --> 02:35:14.419]  And that's exactly what's happening in every big city in this country.
[02:35:15.060 --> 02:35:19.263]  You think of Chicago, you think of Baltimore, you think of Detroit, you think of New York, you think L.A.
[02:35:20.063 --> 02:35:26.165]  But you think of Newark or Camden or New Orleans, you don't really think of Seattle as being one of those cities.
[02:35:26.525 --> 02:35:31.386]  Seattle is overrun with crime because every criminal gets out.
[02:35:31.706 --> 02:35:35.427]  You don't think of my hometown as Las Vegas as being overrun with crime.
[02:35:35.728 --> 02:35:43.850]  Our strip is overrun with crime and a homeless vagrant stamped to death an off-duty police officer just days ago on the Vegas strip.
[02:35:44.330 --> 02:35:50.557]  If a police officer isn't safe walking the Vegas Strip among crowds, what hope is there for the rest of us?
[02:35:51.037 --> 02:35:57.624]  That's how bad it's getting in the United States of America, thanks to lenient criminal policies by Democrats.
[02:35:57.684 --> 02:35:58.325]  We'll be right back.
[02:35:58.345 --> 02:35:58.845]  Wayne Allyn Root.
[02:35:59.146 --> 02:36:00.547]  All right, Wayne Allyn Root back again.
[02:36:01.654 --> 02:36:03.734]  housekeeping to let you know where you can reach me.
[02:36:03.734 --> 02:36:06.533]  You can always find me at rootforamerica.com.
[02:36:06.533 --> 02:36:07.333]  That's my website.
[02:36:07.333 --> 02:36:08.333]  I'm Wade Aller, Root.
[02:36:08.333 --> 02:36:09.134]  What do I do all day?
[02:36:09.134 --> 02:36:09.993]  I root for America.
[02:36:09.993 --> 02:36:11.093]  Easy to remember.
[02:36:11.093 --> 02:36:12.433]  I love this country.
[02:36:12.433 --> 02:36:14.073]  Rootforamerica.com.
[02:36:14.073 --> 02:36:15.573]  How much do I love this country?
[02:36:15.573 --> 02:36:21.213]   My political career began at the age of three when I was handing out literature for Barry Goldwater
[02:36:21.213 --> 02:36:25.474]   in my father's arms at a train station in Malvern in New York.
[02:36:25.459 --> 02:36:26.239]  That's where I was born.
[02:36:26.639 --> 02:36:29.301]  Malvern in New York, Malvern Hospital on the Bronx borderline.
[02:36:30.201 --> 02:36:34.884]  And America was a very different country back then, but I was a big fan of Barry Goldwater at the age of three.
[02:36:34.984 --> 02:36:39.086]  So my patriotic roots go back an awful long way.
[02:36:39.626 --> 02:36:40.226]  I'm 60 years old.
[02:36:40.246 --> 02:36:42.388]  That was 57 years ago.
[02:36:42.468 --> 02:36:45.389]  I started as a Republican at the age of three.
[02:36:45.869 --> 02:36:46.990]  Republican conservative.
[02:36:47.671 --> 02:36:48.973]  My dad, by the way, was a butcher.
[02:36:49.033 --> 02:36:50.314]  I'm an SOB, son of a butcher.
[02:36:50.835 --> 02:36:55.641]  And my dad, the butcher, answered an ad in the New York City newspaper in 1962 when I was two years old.
[02:36:59.820 --> 02:37:05.459]   liberal and a bunch of sellouts, so rhinos, come to the very first meeting of the
[02:37:05.459 --> 02:37:07.060]  conservative party of New York.
[02:37:07.060 --> 02:37:11.500]   And my dad attended and became one of the founders and leaders of the New York State
[02:37:11.500 --> 02:37:13.500]  Conservative Party, even though he's a butcher.
[02:37:13.500 --> 02:37:18.700]   It was a bunch of big shot lawyers and businessmen and one blue collar butcher, David Root,
[02:37:18.700 --> 02:37:22.180]   and my mom, Stella Root, who founded the New York State Conservative Party.
[02:37:22.180 --> 02:37:25.340]  And they became the leaders of Westchester County.
[02:37:25.340 --> 02:37:29.220]   And I grew up handing out literature for Republican candidates who had the endorsement
[02:37:29.220 --> 02:37:35.260]   of the conservative party and literally running campaigns for candidates at the age of 15 and 16
[02:37:35.260 --> 02:37:37.101]  and 17 and 18.
[02:37:37.101 --> 02:37:41.700]   There were a lot of big shots who were very unhappy about that at the time and very jealous of me,
[02:37:41.700 --> 02:37:46.021]   but I actually was named the campaign manager for a guy running for United States Congress
[02:37:46.021 --> 02:37:47.219]  at the age of 18.
[02:37:47.568 --> 02:37:49.969]  And a lot of people were upset, but I did a great job.
[02:37:50.230 --> 02:37:52.450]  Anyway, that's my background.
[02:37:53.171 --> 02:37:58.133]  I was on a roll letting you know some of the big issues going on in America today that I was right about.
[02:37:58.753 --> 02:38:00.994]  You know, I hate to say I told you so, but I told you so.
[02:38:01.656 --> 02:38:15.014]  I said that Black Lives Matter was a fraud from day one, and the reason they're a fraud is that every day black Americans, including kids, are killed on the streets of every big city in America by other black Americans.
[02:38:15.435 --> 02:38:34.495]   So how is the most important issue in the world The one time a year a white cop shoots a black guy, even if he's a criminal with a long record who was once convicted of murder, or in jail for drug dealing, or beating women, or putting a gun against a pregnant woman's belly.
[02:38:35.095 --> 02:38:44.005]  And that guy gets in a fight with cops and that causes nationwide rioting and billions of dollars by American corporations to go to Black Lives Matter.
[02:38:44.446 --> 02:38:49.572]  But all the thousands of black people murdered by other black criminals in America.
[02:38:49.592 --> 02:38:53.096]  Remember 99% of black people are nice people.
[02:38:53.836 --> 02:38:59.201]  1% of these big cities are thugs and criminals, and they're holding the 99% hostage.
[02:38:59.701 --> 02:39:09.410]  And the police are there to protect the 99% of good black people who don't want to be held hostage in their homes, can't walk out at night, can't step out.
[02:39:09.970 --> 02:39:11.371]  In their cars, they could be shot.
[02:39:11.772 --> 02:39:13.193]  On a street corner, they could be shot.
[02:39:13.493 --> 02:39:14.634]  Drug dealers everywhere.
[02:39:14.954 --> 02:39:17.837]  They want to be just like you and me, safe.
[02:39:19.173 --> 02:39:20.854]  Cops doing a great job to keep him safe.
[02:39:21.214 --> 02:39:31.560]  But a couple of times a year, a white cop shoots a black guy who maybe was unarmed, or maybe was trying to grab the gun of the cop while the black guy was unarmed.
[02:39:31.880 --> 02:39:34.361]  And that becomes the biggest racist issue in the world.
[02:39:34.781 --> 02:39:39.044]  But Black Lives Matter couldn't care less when thousands of black people kill thousands of black people.
[02:39:39.404 --> 02:39:39.924]  It's fraud!
[02:39:40.404 --> 02:39:41.205]  It's complete fraud!
[02:39:41.795 --> 02:39:44.097]  They don't care when a black guy's killed.
[02:39:44.578 --> 02:39:47.420]  They only care a nice black person killed by a criminal.
[02:39:47.721 --> 02:39:50.243]  They only care if a white cop shoots somebody.
[02:39:50.743 --> 02:39:56.729]  And now you find out Black Lives Matter purchased a $6 million Los Angeles mansion with their donors' money.
[02:39:57.580 --> 02:39:59.621]  This is not the first time this has come out in the news.
[02:39:59.922 --> 02:40:20.616]  This was in the news this morning, but I've seen it 20 times in the last few months, that the founders of Black Lives Matter, who started out with nothing, who are all communists, mostly communist lesbians, who hate men and don't want men to head households, and they, communist lesbian Black Lives Matter founders, suddenly have multi-million dollar homes.
[02:40:21.036 --> 02:40:21.556]  Lots of them!
[02:40:22.257 --> 02:40:23.458]  Where do you think the money came from?
[02:40:24.919 --> 02:40:25.619]  It's all fraud.
[02:40:26.019 --> 02:40:26.680]  Complete fraud.
[02:40:27.392 --> 02:40:28.413]  Here's another great story.
[02:40:28.873 --> 02:40:38.360]  California City to give universal income to transgender residents and non-binary residents regardless of earnings.
[02:40:39.180 --> 02:40:48.007]  So Palm Springs has decided to give basically a thousand dollars a month to anyone who's transgender even if you make a million dollars a year.
[02:40:48.627 --> 02:40:53.270]  Because if you're transgender somehow they believe you deserve it?
[02:40:53.551 --> 02:40:53.951]  I don't know.
[02:40:54.371 --> 02:40:55.292]  It's so bizarre.
[02:40:55.993 --> 02:41:00.497]  You know, I always said affirmative action is absolutely absurd.
[02:41:01.617 --> 02:41:09.023]  Because if it's racist to say you can't have a job because you're black, it's just as racist to say you can't have a job because you're white.
[02:41:09.263 --> 02:41:14.807]  And I'm going to give it to a black person who may not be qualified for the job, but I gave it to him because of the color of their skin.
[02:41:15.608 --> 02:41:17.550]  And this is the exact same story.
[02:41:18.110 --> 02:41:25.760]   Because you're born Transgender or because you think you've changed your identity and now you are non-binary.
[02:41:25.780 --> 02:41:26.982]  Someone please Google for me.
[02:41:27.462 --> 02:41:28.924]  What does non-binary mean?
[02:41:29.405 --> 02:41:30.185]  Are you a fish?
[02:41:31.070 --> 02:41:32.291]  Are you a frog?
[02:41:32.852 --> 02:41:38.777]  Do you think you can change from male to female depending on your mood of the day?
[02:41:39.398 --> 02:41:42.160]  And tomorrow you're a man and the next day you're a woman?
[02:41:42.560 --> 02:41:44.242]  That must be what non-binary means.
[02:41:44.682 --> 02:41:47.925]  It's a frog or a fish can go from one to the other.
[02:41:48.266 --> 02:41:50.768]  Now people think they can go from one to the other.
[02:41:51.288 --> 02:41:53.210]  See, being gay is not a mental illness.
[02:41:53.250 --> 02:41:54.291]  Being gay is what you are.
[02:41:54.631 --> 02:41:55.272]  You're born gay.
[02:41:55.911 --> 02:42:02.575]  But being a person who believes you can change from man to woman is pure mental illness.
[02:42:03.035 --> 02:42:11.459]  And we are starting to celebrate the absurd and the perverse in America and trying to make it seem normal.
[02:42:11.880 --> 02:42:14.641]  And we're trying to make normal people seem weird.
[02:42:15.121 --> 02:42:16.302]  And Disney's the king of that.
[02:42:17.017 --> 02:42:18.358]  What do I have left now, time-wise?
[02:42:18.438 --> 02:42:20.039]  Do I have enough for three minutes?
[02:42:20.079 --> 02:42:21.380]  Not enough to read Defund Disney.
[02:42:21.741 --> 02:42:26.484]  So I've been promising, I've been threatening, I'm going to read you Defund Disney.
[02:42:26.864 --> 02:42:29.486]  I will get to it to start the next segment.
[02:42:29.887 --> 02:42:32.388]  So you can hear my plan to defund Disney.
[02:42:32.409 --> 02:42:35.151]  But I don't, I need about six minutes to read it, not three minutes.
[02:42:35.591 --> 02:42:40.975]  So in the last three minutes, I will mention the number one issue in America today.
[02:42:41.690 --> 02:42:43.551]  It's a new show I'm looking to put on the air, by the way.
[02:42:43.891 --> 02:42:52.214]  I'm negotiating with several different online TV networks and real TV networks to put my show on the air, and the show's going to be called America's Top 10 Countdown.
[02:42:52.715 --> 02:42:54.475]  I think what we need is like Casey Kasem.
[02:42:54.816 --> 02:42:56.736]  I want to be the conservative Casey Kasem.
[02:42:57.056 --> 02:43:05.040]  He counted down America's top 40, and this is my podcast every week, by the way, on Fridays, and you can find that at Root4America.com.
[02:43:05.340 --> 02:43:06.660]  Root4America.com.
[02:43:06.981 --> 02:43:10.122]  And you can email me anytime, WayneRoot at gmail.com.
[02:43:11.676 --> 02:43:22.443]  But every Friday, and there's my website, RootForAmerica.com, there's my book on the website, The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book, and we can lead the boycott of Disney.
[02:43:22.783 --> 02:43:23.404]  We all can.
[02:43:23.464 --> 02:43:43.044]   Grab a copy of my book, and I'll show you how, because I'll give you the phone number of Disney's CEO and Chairman of the Board, and important board members, and their address, and their social media, all of that in my book, The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book, which has been number one, by the way, at At Amazon.com and at Barnes & Noble quite a few times in the last few months.
[02:43:43.084 --> 02:43:45.487]  So grab a copy and I'll show you how to defund Disney.
[02:43:45.767 --> 02:43:47.068]  My new book is coming up, by the way.
[02:43:47.088 --> 02:43:48.730]  It should be out in about 60 days.
[02:43:48.810 --> 02:43:52.273]  It's called The Great Patriot Boycott.
[02:43:52.713 --> 02:43:54.555]  Not boycott, boycott book!
[02:43:54.855 --> 02:44:03.347]  Because I'm going to show you the companies to buy from instead of Disney, and Coca-Cola, and Ben & Jerry's ice cream, and Delta Airlines.
[02:44:03.668 --> 02:44:10.918]  Instead of all the bad companies that support communist causes, and causes that are against American exceptionalism.
[02:44:11.794 --> 02:44:21.542]  I will show you how to support companies that support patriots and Christians and conservatives and people who are family-oriented and believe in Judeo-Christian values.
[02:44:21.903 --> 02:44:27.207]  The Great Patriot boycott book, that'll be out in about 60 days.
[02:44:27.607 --> 02:44:53.040]   But the way they're destroying America is through this Title 42 plan to eliminate Title 42 and leaked Homeland Security documents came out today Border Chief Alejandro Mayorkas is directing this plan to let every single illegal in the world into America and to eliminate all chances to ever send them back.
[02:44:53.692 --> 02:45:03.639]  This is a purposeful, as I've said from day one, communist attack on the United States of America to destroy America once and for all and to wipe out the middle class.
[02:45:03.659 --> 02:45:04.059]  That's you.
[02:45:04.379 --> 02:45:05.820]  To wipe out the silent majority.
[02:45:05.860 --> 02:45:06.300]  That's you.
[02:45:06.701 --> 02:45:07.361]  And it's happening.
[02:45:07.701 --> 02:45:08.842]  And we've got it in writing.
[02:45:09.342 --> 02:45:14.886]  I always said it was part of Cloward Pivot that I learned at Columbia Diversity alongside my communist classmate.
[02:45:15.652 --> 02:45:17.614]  Barack Hussein Obama.
[02:45:18.035 --> 02:45:32.411]  This is how they're destroying the United States by overwhelming this country and this economy with foreigners on welfare who don't believe in American exceptionalism, who don't know American history, who don't speak English, and who want welfare from cradle to grave.
[02:45:32.712 --> 02:45:33.272]  I'm Wayne Allyn Root.
[02:45:33.573 --> 02:45:34.354]  We'll be right back.
[02:45:34.634 --> 02:45:36.276]  I'm guest host of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:45:37.290 --> 02:45:38.110]  All right, welcome back!
[02:45:38.190 --> 02:45:43.392]  Wayne Allyn Root, guest host for Alex Jones on Tuesdays from noon to 1 p.m.
[02:45:43.432 --> 02:45:47.513]  Pacific Time, which should be 3 to 4 o'clock East Coast Time.
[02:45:47.994 --> 02:45:51.635]  Most Tuesdays, not next Tuesday, because I'll tell you what's coming up.
[02:45:51.695 --> 02:45:58.117]  Something really special in my life is coming up next Monday, and I'll be flying back all day on Tuesday.
[02:45:58.497 --> 02:46:00.778]  So I'll miss this show Tuesday, but I'll be here the week after.
[02:46:01.590 --> 02:46:03.912]  But I'm flying to Florida on Sunday.
[02:46:03.972 --> 02:46:14.463]  First of all, I haven't been here on the Alex Jones Show for about two weeks because I had my honeymoon with my lovely wife Cindy at Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump's estate.
[02:46:14.984 --> 02:46:16.085]  And we had a wonderful time.
[02:46:16.145 --> 02:46:17.266]  I wrote a commentary about it.
[02:46:17.286 --> 02:46:20.229]  You can find it at rootforamerica.com.
[02:46:21.380 --> 02:46:41.024]  And I wrote how for all the Trump haters in the world out there, you'll be very upset to learn that President Trump was looking confident and strong and carefree and absolutely, in my opinion, will be running for president again in 2024 as the clear frontrunner, not just to win the Republican nomination.
[02:46:41.345 --> 02:46:42.505]  That's a fait accompli.
[02:46:42.764 --> 02:46:48.103]   He will be the Republican nominee if he runs, but to win the election, and he looks the best of his life.
[02:46:48.103 --> 02:46:49.244]  He looks fantastic.
[02:46:49.244 --> 02:46:52.324]   So all the Trump haters, heads will explode when they hear that.
[02:46:52.324 --> 02:46:56.264]   I had a great time in Mar-a-Lago, and if you wanna know the full story,
[02:46:56.264 --> 02:47:00.244]   go to rootforamerica.com, and I've got the whole commentary there.
[02:47:00.244 --> 02:47:01.564]  But here's what happened.
[02:47:01.564 --> 02:47:07.564]   I was booked about two months ago to be the speaker at Club 45 in Florida,
[02:47:07.564 --> 02:47:10.684]  Palm Beach, Florida, to be exact, on April 11th.
[02:47:10.684 --> 02:47:12.404]  That's next Monday night.
[02:47:12.404 --> 02:47:15.244]  That is the biggest Trump club in the world.
[02:47:15.584 --> 02:47:27.913]  And every month they have the biggest Republican politicians and Republican stars in America, conservative stars, they fly them in and they give a speech in front of thousands at their events for Club 45.
[02:47:27.953 --> 02:47:31.836]  So I was booked for about two months now to give that speech.
[02:47:32.481 --> 02:47:35.542]  But President Trump found out I was giving that speech.
[02:47:36.002 --> 02:47:39.303]  And he's never gone to a Club 45 event before.
[02:47:39.663 --> 02:47:41.983]  And he's never spoken at a Club 45 event.
[02:47:43.044 --> 02:47:47.185]  And so he found out I was speaking, and he said, Wayne Root speaking, count me in, I'll be there.
[02:47:47.785 --> 02:47:57.947]  So it's now a Wayne Root, Donald Trump event, and a Wayne Root, Donald Trump speech, or as Trump would probably want it said, a Donald Trump, Wayne Root speech and event.
[02:47:58.467 --> 02:48:00.768]  And it's sold out every ticket in 20 minutes.
[02:48:01.708 --> 02:48:03.230]  And so 6 p.m.
[02:48:03.750 --> 02:48:09.977]  East Coast time on Monday night in Palm Beach, Florida, I will be speaking with alongside President Trump.
[02:48:09.997 --> 02:48:15.022]  It'll be just the two of us on stage as a tag team like the World Wrestling Federation.
[02:48:15.462 --> 02:48:16.703]  And we'll have the time of our lives.
[02:48:16.763 --> 02:48:22.129]  I'll bet you that audience will hear two of the most passionate, high-energy Republican speeches they've ever heard.
[02:48:22.709 --> 02:48:24.050]  And God bless America.
[02:48:24.410 --> 02:48:29.892]  The son of a butcher is speaking alongside the former leader of the free world, President Donald J. Trump.
[02:48:29.952 --> 02:48:30.733]  What a great honor.
[02:48:30.773 --> 02:48:33.034]  Thank you for coming to my event, President Trump.
[02:48:33.374 --> 02:48:40.497]  After he speaks, he will be listening to my speech, and that is a great honor to have him in the audience while I deliver my speech.
[02:48:40.517 --> 02:48:41.457]  There it is up on the screen.
[02:48:41.497 --> 02:48:43.978]  Club 45, Wayne Allyn Root, and President Trump.
[02:48:44.339 --> 02:48:44.539]  All right.
[02:48:44.799 --> 02:48:47.678]  I promised you defund Disney, and I promised I'd get to it.
[02:48:47.678 --> 02:48:48.519]  Here it is.
[02:48:48.519 --> 02:48:49.839]  I wrote this commentary.
[02:48:49.839 --> 02:48:54.119]   My columns are nationally syndicated by newspapers and conservative websites.
[02:48:54.119 --> 02:48:59.119]   My great friend and co-author, Nikki Ballou and I recently released our first book together,
[02:48:59.119 --> 02:49:01.739]  The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book.
[02:49:01.739 --> 02:49:08.379]   It's a book that lists 116 woke corporations and condemns their fear-driven assault
[02:49:08.379 --> 02:49:10.719]  on normal, traditional Americans.
[02:49:10.916 --> 02:49:22.961]  We show conservatives, Christians, capitalists, and patriots how to fight back against these gigantic, woke, anti-American corporations who are spitting in our faces while we make them rich by buying their products.
[02:49:24.581 --> 02:49:28.743]  And one of the companies on our list, right at the top, is Disney Corporation.
[02:49:29.543 --> 02:49:30.804]  I must have had a crystal ball.
[02:49:30.884 --> 02:49:34.285]  I knew that Disney would become the center of attention.
[02:49:34.992 --> 02:49:41.197]  And lo and behold, Disney just became the poster child for our struggle to save America.
[02:49:41.798 --> 02:49:56.370]  They have got to be our Mona Lisa, our great masterpiece, proving that we, conservatives, Christians and patriots, can successfully cancel woke companies that offend and spit in the face of conservatives.
[02:49:57.150 --> 02:50:01.157]   Once we hurt Disney in the pocketbook, And bring them to their knees.
[02:50:01.697 --> 02:50:06.018]  This will serve as exhibit A for how the silent majority can take back America.
[02:50:06.539 --> 02:50:10.160]  Disney could very well be the worst offender we've ever seen.
[02:50:10.700 --> 02:50:17.363]  With their arrogance and radical beliefs, they've made themselves the target of 80 million plus Trump conservatives.
[02:50:17.403 --> 02:50:19.464]  And yes, I said that for a reason.
[02:50:19.884 --> 02:50:21.464]  Trump got 74 million votes.
[02:50:21.825 --> 02:50:25.426]  I believe he has 80 million votes in the last election.
[02:50:26.098 --> 02:50:28.199]  Disney has made it easy to hate Disney.
[02:50:28.680 --> 02:50:30.841]  They have no one but themselves to blame.
[02:50:31.501 --> 02:50:33.802]  Disney has chosen a hill to die on.
[02:50:33.843 --> 02:50:35.523]  There's that famous saying again.
[02:50:36.004 --> 02:50:51.913]  They want to overturn the new Florida law that stops the indoctrination of little children from pre-kindergarten through third grade with woke sexual gender identity, brainwashing, and transgender equality education.
[02:50:52.685 --> 02:50:56.147]  Keep in mind we're only talking about five to eight-year-olds.
[02:50:56.847 --> 02:51:04.532]  What parent could possibly disagree with stopping the brainwashing of kindergarten through third grade, five to eight-year-olds?
[02:51:04.972 --> 02:51:10.915]  What parent visiting Disney could possibly disagree, whether it's Disney World or Disneyland?
[02:51:11.376 --> 02:51:13.077]  What parent could disagree they couldn't?
[02:51:13.677 --> 02:51:15.358]  But Disney doesn't care!
[02:51:16.061 --> 02:51:33.045]  They are intent on alienating the tens of millions of parents who don't believe that 5- to 8-year-olds should be sexualized at school, and who also don't believe those same 5- to 8-year-olds should be taught to change their sexual identity like I change a pair of sneakers.
[02:51:33.805 --> 02:51:34.605]  Can you imagine?
[02:51:35.065 --> 02:51:38.146]  Disney has chosen this hill to die on.
[02:51:38.506 --> 02:51:39.186]  They're crazy.
[02:51:39.647 --> 02:51:40.507]  They're out of their minds.
[02:51:40.847 --> 02:51:44.228]  They're risking their entire company, and they made a very bad bet.
[02:51:44.828 --> 02:51:45.608]  Let's call them on it.
[02:51:46.932 --> 02:51:58.763]  The president of Disney recently bragged that she will make sure that half of all characters in Disney movies and television shows and videos are either gay, lesbian, trans, or minorities.
[02:52:00.124 --> 02:52:01.065]  I have no problem with that.
[02:52:01.465 --> 02:52:02.066]  You want to do that?
[02:52:02.106 --> 02:52:02.346]  Do it.
[02:52:02.366 --> 02:52:03.367]  America's a free country.
[02:52:04.062 --> 02:52:21.787]  But I hope she and her Disney board of directors and her Disney CEO and her Disney chairman of the board have no problem if I have free speech and if conservatives like me, tens of millions of us and Christians and patriots decide to never again visit any Disney theme park.
[02:52:21.827 --> 02:52:24.868]  There is the president of Disney television on the screen right now.
[02:52:25.389 --> 02:52:28.750]  She made a point of bragging that she has two children.
[02:52:29.230 --> 02:52:33.131]  One is transgender and the other is gender fluid.
[02:52:34.085 --> 02:52:38.129]  Folks, I don't even know what these mentally ill people are talking about, and I don't really care.
[02:52:38.149 --> 02:52:44.334]  I just want them to keep their education away from my children, their brainwashing away from my children, and you know what else?
[02:52:44.814 --> 02:52:47.937]  Their estranged children away from my children.
[02:52:48.317 --> 02:52:49.438]  This is weird stuff.
[02:52:50.059 --> 02:53:01.689]  So if no patriot and no Christian and no conservative ever again goes to a Disney theme park or ever again spends a dime on a Disney product, I wonder how Disney will feel about our free speech.
[02:53:03.309 --> 02:53:04.759]  All is fair in war, right?
[02:53:05.436 --> 02:53:12.918]  And this is a war between Disney and America, American values, American exceptionalism and Judeo-Christian values.
[02:53:13.538 --> 02:53:27.862]  This is a far cry from the vision of Disney's founder, the iconic Walt Disney, a true American patriot and hero who wanted to create movies and television shows that were family oriented and wholesome to entertain the whole family.
[02:53:28.342 --> 02:53:33.623]  Disney made billions of dollars from brilliantly executing on Walt Disney's vision.
[02:53:34.329 --> 02:53:39.592]  My co-author Nikki Blue and I outline in our book exactly what to do.
[02:53:39.632 --> 02:53:49.138]  We provide the names of Disney's Chairman of the Board, Disney's CEO, their phone numbers, their email addresses, their social media addresses, and their physical addresses.
[02:53:49.799 --> 02:53:54.218]   All of this information is provided in a directory in the back of our book called
[02:53:54.218 --> 02:54:00.419]   The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book for 116 woke companies that you can protest,
[02:54:00.419 --> 02:54:02.999]  boycott, strike, and put out of business.
[02:54:02.999 --> 02:54:05.638]  Disney just became our number one target.
[02:54:05.638 --> 02:54:11.658]   First, I want you to look up the email address and the address for Disney and its key senior executives
[02:54:11.658 --> 02:54:20.539]   and then bombard them with polite, be polite, but firm messages that you will choose to boycott Disney
[02:54:20.539 --> 02:54:22.179]  for their woke choices.
[02:54:22.556 --> 02:54:27.380]  Secondly, and if you go to my website, Root for America, I'll show you an example of a letter you should send them.
[02:54:27.941 --> 02:54:29.182]  Secondly, follow through.
[02:54:29.582 --> 02:54:31.044]  Stop doing business with Disney.
[02:54:31.704 --> 02:54:32.825]  Don't buy anything from Disney.
[02:54:32.845 --> 02:54:33.986]  Don't watch anything from Disney.
[02:54:34.387 --> 02:54:35.508]  Post on social media.
[02:54:36.199 --> 02:54:39.279]  and encourage others to stop doing business with them.
[02:54:39.279 --> 02:54:40.739]  Make Disney pay.
[02:54:40.739 --> 02:54:47.978]   Third, sign up to our email list at rootforamerica.com and join the army of God-fearing, patriotic Americans
[02:54:47.978 --> 02:54:52.499]   who are fed up with woke corporations who take our money and then spit in our faces.
[02:54:52.499 --> 02:54:58.639]   Businesses exist to serve their customers, to solve our problems, to make our lives better.
[02:54:58.788 --> 02:55:06.013]  They do not exist to promote woke ideology or brainwash our children to change their sexual identity.
[02:55:06.454 --> 02:55:08.275]  Disney is now the poster child.
[02:55:08.615 --> 02:55:10.216]  It's time for Disney to pay.
[02:55:10.597 --> 02:55:12.518]  It's time to bring Disney to their knees.
[02:55:13.038 --> 02:55:15.240]  It's time to defund Disney.
[02:55:15.780 --> 02:55:19.603]  Let's start by treating Disney like the Feds once treated Al Capone.
[02:55:20.063 --> 02:55:22.424]  Disney is now our public enemy number one.
[02:55:22.865 --> 02:55:23.905]  They richly deserve it.
[02:55:24.186 --> 02:55:25.026]  Defund Disney.
[02:55:25.326 --> 02:55:37.348]   And if we succeed in making Disney go to their knees and apologize and change their corporate policy, then there's 115 other Corporations in my book, The Great Patriot Protest.
[02:55:37.688 --> 02:55:39.088]  We can go work on them next.
[02:55:39.489 --> 02:55:43.250]  Let's make Disney public enemy number one and prove that it works.
[02:55:43.790 --> 02:55:44.490]  I'm Wayne Allyn Root.
[02:55:44.870 --> 02:55:46.271]  Show is coming to an end for today.
[02:55:46.691 --> 02:55:48.231]  I'll see you in two Tuesdays.
[02:55:48.611 --> 02:55:52.012]  I'm headed to my speech with President Donald Trump next Monday.
[02:55:52.072 --> 02:55:54.513]  I'm flying back home to Las Vegas on Tuesday.
[02:55:54.813 --> 02:55:55.313]  Love y'all.
[02:55:55.333 --> 02:55:56.334]  Appreciate y'all.
[02:55:56.754 --> 02:56:00.235]  God bless every single one of you, the Patriots of America.
[02:56:00.315 --> 02:56:01.535]  RootforAmerica.com.
[02:56:01.735 --> 02:56:03.735]  BladeRoot@gmail.com.
[02:56:03.735 --> 02:56:22.735]  [outro]
[02:56:22.886 --> 02:56:28.207]  We have a symbiotic relationship and there's been major supply chain breakdowns as you know the last few years.
[02:56:28.547 --> 02:56:34.989]  That's why so many products we've had to either discontinue them or reformulate them or just wait and wait and wait for them to come in.
[02:56:36.249 --> 02:56:55.178]   It was 11 months ago we put our deposit down To the US company that has a deal with France to get the patented special quail eggs that are fed a secret diet that in major even trials and studies have been proven to work better than over-the-counter antihistamines but in a natural way.
[02:56:55.378 --> 02:57:00.502]  And finally, 11 months after I put down the money to get it, we were about to discontinue it and demand our money back.
[02:57:00.782 --> 02:57:01.302]  Came in.
[02:57:01.442 --> 02:57:02.103]  Pollen Block.
[02:57:02.143 --> 02:57:03.224]  Packaged here in the U.S.
[02:57:03.464 --> 02:57:05.125]  Specially fed quail in France.
[02:57:05.145 --> 02:57:06.526]  I discovered this 100 years ago.
[02:57:06.546 --> 02:57:09.108]  They were being fed a certain diet and people ate those eggs.
[02:57:09.328 --> 02:57:10.488]  The French eat a lot of quail eggs.
[02:57:10.509 --> 02:57:11.469]  A lot of people in Texas do it.
[02:57:11.509 --> 02:57:13.110]  But the point is that you wouldn't get allergies.
[02:57:13.250 --> 02:57:16.232]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's from the quail egg shell, I should add.
[02:57:16.292 --> 02:57:18.194]  Well, it's back in stock.
[02:57:18.694 --> 02:57:18.894]  40% off.
[02:57:18.954 --> 02:57:21.236]  And who knows, this could be the only time it's ever available again.
[02:57:21.256 --> 02:57:23.417]  You know, they're bringing lockdowns and shutdowns back.
[02:57:23.437 --> 02:57:24.958]  But we finally got it back in.
[02:57:25.058 --> 02:57:26.239]  It's very proprietary.
[02:57:26.279 --> 02:57:27.120]  Very, very special.
[02:57:27.220 --> 02:57:27.740]  It's available.
[02:57:27.760 --> 02:57:29.141]  You can sign up for auto-ship additional.
[02:57:29.761 --> 02:57:32.943]  10% off, then we'll hold some back for your next order, so you are sure to get it.
[02:57:33.023 --> 02:57:34.784]  But we're ready to ship it to you right now, back in stock.
[02:57:34.884 --> 02:57:39.506]  PollenBlock at InfoWarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:57:39.566 --> 02:57:41.146]  Helps support healthy sinus function.
[02:57:41.166 --> 02:57:42.527]  Helps enhance respiratory function.
[02:57:42.607 --> 02:57:44.708]  Helps clear passageways and airways of normal breathing.
[02:57:44.748 --> 02:57:45.809]  Promotes respiratory health.
[02:57:45.889 --> 02:57:47.669]  Supports eye comfort and sinus health.
[02:57:47.749 --> 02:57:49.530]  So much more quail egg concentrate.
[02:57:49.630 --> 02:57:53.172]  It's just pure quail egg concentrate at InfoWarstore.com.
[02:57:53.332 --> 02:57:56.654]  You're watching the American Journal with Harrison Smith.
[02:57:57.955 --> 02:57:59.678]  The Alex Jones Show!
[02:57:59.998 --> 02:58:03.565]  This is The War Room with Owen Schreier!
[02:58:03.726 --> 02:58:07.833]  InfraWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:58:10.472 --> 02:58:21.621]  When you went to InfoWarsStore.com and purchased the first in the three-part series of our limited edition coin release, you funded InfoWars into the future.
[02:58:22.302 --> 02:58:27.947]  We probably would have had a lot more problems and maybe not have even been on air here today like we are.
[02:58:28.627 --> 02:58:31.028]  If you didn't take part in that campaign.
[02:58:31.108 --> 02:58:33.768]  And so we're kind of back to where we were then.
[02:58:34.128 --> 02:58:41.791]  And we just launched part two in the Patriot Collectibles InfoWars limited coin series.
[02:58:42.051 --> 02:58:47.052]  And that is the latest addition with the Blood of Patriots and Tyrants.
[02:58:48.407 --> 02:58:52.270]  The Tree of Liberty must be refreshed from time to time.
[02:58:52.910 --> 02:58:55.031]  And you're seeing it on the screen right there.
[02:58:55.792 --> 02:58:59.154]  And so this is so great because it's a limited edition coin release.
[02:58:59.835 --> 02:59:01.396]  It will fund us into the future.
[02:59:02.016 --> 02:59:05.738]  And it's actually pure silver, 0.9999 pure silver.
[02:59:06.279 --> 02:59:15.445]  So you're actually getting something that has inherent value and can, you know, potentially even not just have the sentimental value, but the inherent value of being pure silver.
[02:59:16.755 --> 02:59:23.679]  And a lot of people think that the silver market is synthetically kept down, but we're not selling you here saying this is an investment.
[02:59:23.699 --> 02:59:25.960]  We're saying this is an investment in InfoWars.
[02:59:26.600 --> 02:59:29.242]  This is an investment in free speech.
[02:59:30.142 --> 02:59:36.966]  So get your one-ounce Tree of Liberty founding member silver rounds at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:59:37.666 --> 02:59:41.651]  Or you can go to patriotcollectibles.com and get it there as well.
[02:59:41.691 --> 02:59:47.318]  Sorry, I had to refresh my memory there for a second on the other website, patriotcollectibles.com.
[02:59:47.438 --> 02:59:50.582]  Either one, that's what funds InfoWars into the future.
[02:59:51.664 --> 03:00:02.714]   And obviously, We thought that the last silver coin was maybe the coolest coin you're going to find in a mint, but maybe it's this one with the Tree of Liberty on one side.
[03:00:02.734 --> 03:00:10.247]  And if you really get deep into the details here, you can see we put the Infowars hexagon logo deeply embedded.
