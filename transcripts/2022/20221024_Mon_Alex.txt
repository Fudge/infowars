[00:00:00.757 --> 00:00:02.158]  World War Three.
[00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:05.021]  David Petraeus says U.S.
[00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:09.926]  may lead multinational force against Russia in Ukraine.
[00:00:10.807 --> 00:00:17.953]  He goes on to say the force is ready and prepared, but it won't be NATO, just NATO backed and commanded.
[00:00:18.534 --> 00:00:22.498]  That is NATO in direct war in Europe with the Russians.
[00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:31.944]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:00:32.183 --> 00:00:34.183]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.183 --> 00:00:45.183]  It's Monday, October 24th, 2022 on this Monday edition.
[00:00:45.437 --> 00:00:46.278]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.782]  I come to the viewers and listeners of this broadcast with extremely grave news.
[00:00:52.344 --> 00:01:01.153]  I've looked at all the different angles, played through the different scenarios, and analyzed globalist propaganda in Ukraine going back more than eight years.
[00:01:02.134 --> 00:01:12.965]  In fact, longer than that, it was in Zbigniew Brzezinski's plan written in the 1970s to bring down the Soviet Union with a pincer attack by fomenting a rebellion in Afghanistan and also one in Ukraine.
[00:01:14.485 --> 00:01:19.970]  Well, decades later, they actually launched the attack in Ukraine, overthrowing the elected government.
[00:01:20.451 --> 00:01:23.414]  Whether you're for the Russians or against the Russians, it doesn't even matter at this point.
[00:01:24.315 --> 00:01:46.550]   Mainline political analysts like Zbigniew Brzezinski's counterpart, Henry Kissinger, and the Pope, and many others, like Benjamin Netanyahu of all people, have gone on the news and said, this needs to de-escalate, this needs to stop now, because it is going to lead to tactical nuclear weapons, and that will probably lead to the use of theater weapons.
[00:01:47.711 --> 00:02:13.007]   So when you look at all the different angles surrounding what's currently unfolding in this escalation, I have said many times, and remember I predicted back in October of last year the Russians would invade by February, that they would use a dirty bomb, false flag attack, that is the globalist NATO, the Ukrainians, as a pretext to bring NATO fully into the conflict.
[00:02:13.947 --> 00:02:14.208]  Now U.S.
[00:02:14.228 --> 00:02:19.010]  troops have been massing on the border with Ukraine.
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.865]  And they've been training with a multinational force that they're not calling NATO, but is a NATO force.
[00:02:28.026 --> 00:02:43.837]  And General Petraeus and other key globalists have been making the rounds on international television and in print saying that if the Russians engage in any radiological dirty bombs or chemical attacks, that's a red line and the U.S.
[00:02:45.205 --> 00:02:54.109]  troops army forces the Rangers will then go in directly against the Russians.
[00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.999]   Petraeus went on to say that I had a 40th slip calling him betrayus.
[00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:13.509]  Betrayus went on to say, in the full interviews and articles are on InfoWars.com, read it and see it for yourself, that this would then escalate to war and would finally defeat Russia, and that even if the U.S.
[00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:21.155]  doesn't fully come into the war publicly, Russia's still going to lose, but that he predicts that Russia is going to escalate themselves.
[00:03:21.976 --> 00:03:24.098]  So the globalists need a false flag.
[00:03:24.118 --> 00:03:33.285]   They need a pretext To openly bring NATO under another name, a quote, multinational force, in to directly engage in a war with the Russians.
[00:03:33.305 --> 00:03:34.166]  Now already U.S.
[00:03:34.186 --> 00:03:37.528]  troops and advisors and mercenaries have been there for eight years.
[00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:44.433]  Already there are special forces troops that have been sheet-dipped in the Ukrainian military leading and coordinating the attacks.
[00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:59.222]  We are in a de facto war with Russia right now, and we've definitely sleptwalk into it, because even though over 80% of Americans in major polls are against the war, they still on average don't see the war as the number one issue.
[00:03:59.262 --> 00:04:03.166]  They see inflation, they see crime, they see open borders as the number one issue.
[00:04:03.626 --> 00:04:09.512]  And those are certainly bad things being run by the very same WEF and the globalist Great Reset Agenda.
[00:04:10.593 --> 00:04:31.365]  When you pull back and you understand that the New World Order needs a major global crisis on top of the COVID crisis as a smokescreen for their great reset and the establishment of this World ID, new digital global central bank currency, then it all falls into place.
[00:04:32.245 --> 00:04:35.467]  Why would they inject billions of people with a poison shot?
[00:04:36.027 --> 00:04:37.588]  Why would they already kill tens of millions?
[00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:41.711]  Why would they be shutting off the economy and shutting off the pipelines and shutting off oil drilling?
[00:04:42.311 --> 00:04:45.773]  Because it's all part of bringing down civilization.
[00:04:45.813 --> 00:04:52.977]  We have to understand they've gone from the test phase of this to the operational phase of this and that's why we're in so much danger.
[00:04:53.698 --> 00:05:01.921]   Now when we come back I'm going to explain The rest of the different pieces of evidence we have and break down and predict where this is going.
[00:05:02.281 --> 00:05:08.485]  There's also a good chance for us to stop it if we understand the larger program and raise the alarm as modern Paul Revere's.
[00:05:08.965 --> 00:05:11.767]  We'll be right back on the other side of this live Monday broadcast.
[00:05:12.207 --> 00:05:14.108]  Owen Schroer and a string of amazing guests.
[00:05:14.188 --> 00:05:15.789]  Your Calls and More is coming up.
[00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.411]  Remember, if you're watching or listening to this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:05:19.791 --> 00:05:20.772]  We are InfoWars.
[00:05:21.212 --> 00:05:22.393]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:05:23.712 --> 00:05:28.056]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us on this live Monday broadcast.
[00:05:28.896 --> 00:05:33.139]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, bringing you very, very solemn, very, very serious news.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:39.625]  We've been warning the last eight years that the globalists were planning a NATO-backed war in Ukraine against Russia.
[00:05:41.277 --> 00:05:47.301]  And now after the overthrow of the government eight years ago, the escalation of the conflict, the Russians invaded, as we all know, in February.
[00:05:48.321 --> 00:05:53.704]  And we predicted in October of last year that would happen by the end of February from our research and intel.
[00:05:54.445 --> 00:05:58.007]  And unfortunately, I've got even worse news for you right now.
[00:05:58.988 --> 00:06:00.628]  There's a lot of different factors that go into this.
[00:06:00.648 --> 00:06:02.710]  I'll try to lay them out here and then give you my analysis.
[00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:18.876]   And unfortunately, my analysis is about 90% at this point that there's going to be Full-on public war with Russia and at least a tactical nuclear war In Europe and I know that's the unthinkable
[00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:43.118]  But the reason we know that that's where they're going is the globalists need a smokescreen for the collapse of the world financial system, and on its ashes to roll out these central bank programmable digital currencies, which again are not Bitcoin, they're the opposite, that are centralized and controlled, and then they can program how you can use them where and when.
[00:06:45.078 --> 00:06:46.079]  Now, let's go back.
[00:06:47.481 --> 00:07:31.120]   Before we talk about the latest developments with Putin and others getting on the phone to world leaders over the weekend and saying they had credible intel that Ukraine backed by NATO groups is set to detonate a dirty bomb, not a tactical nuke, Not, not, not a nuclear detonation of any type, but a classic radiological bomb where you have a bunch of radiological pieces or parts jacketed with explosives and that basically makes a large area where it's dispersed, extremely radioactive, similar to when a nuclear reactor
[00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:33.050]  Uh, melts down.
[00:07:34.391 --> 00:07:35.972]  Now, let's start walking through the pieces here.
[00:07:37.112 --> 00:07:48.017]  After the Russians came out and warned of that, Zelensky, the dictator now of Ukraine, came out and said, oh, that's ridiculous, it's the Russians that are about to do this.
[00:07:48.717 --> 00:07:50.218]  We're not going to stage any false flags.
[00:07:51.339 --> 00:07:58.522]  Now remember, our corporate media has tried to blame Russia for the pipeline explosion, and they even tried to claim Russia was behind the bridge as a false flag.
[00:07:59.963 --> 00:08:05.088]  But Ukraine couldn't contain themselves and brag that they'd done it with British intelligence MI6.
[00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:10.413]  So these are all massive escalations, all massive upping the ante.
[00:08:11.474 --> 00:08:48.611]   Now we have General Petraeus and a bunch of other globalists all over the news, the articles are on Infowars.com, saying that there is a multinational group of troops Training right now in Poland and in Germany and in other areas made up of Army Special Operations Army Rangers and others that are preparing to lead a major push into the east of Ukraine in a direct conflict with Russian forces
[00:08:49.878 --> 00:09:01.027]  And Petraeus went on to say that all they need is some type of provocation like a chemical or radiological attack not just a tactical nuclear weapon.
[00:09:02.648 --> 00:09:03.869]  So they are telegraphing.
[00:09:05.441 --> 00:09:08.342]  to the world that these are the red lines.
[00:09:09.303 --> 00:09:13.625]  Just like they said if Assad used chemical weapons in Syria that the U.S.
[00:09:13.645 --> 00:09:14.666]  would come into the war openly.
[00:09:15.366 --> 00:09:39.239]   Well, then we know because the videos came out, it was confirmed that U.N.-funded jihadi groups were the ones that launched more than 10 chemical attacks Over several years of the Syrian war in an attempt in a false flag to frame the Assad regime as a pretext to again publicly bring not just the US but Israel and NATO into that war.
[00:09:39.999 --> 00:09:45.981]  Notice that the controlled Western corporate media always criticizes anybody that talks about false flags as if they don't exist.
[00:09:46.661 --> 00:10:13.589]   But then on the eve of the Russian invasion in February, the CIA spokesperson at the State Department gave a speech and there was questionable reporters where he said the Russians are planning false flags, car bombings and the like as a pretext as their cover to invade Ukraine and indeed there is some evidence that the Russians did indeed set off some car bombs and things as a pretext to say that Russian held areas were being attacked and so they had to bring their main military in.
[00:10:14.129 --> 00:10:23.547]   The point is these things do go on and so now you have the Russians saying that we don't want an escalation And Nature wants to fully and publicly come in.
[00:10:24.662 --> 00:10:37.087]  Under the guise of this multinational force that Petraeus and others admit is training, is massing, and is preparing, well then do we believe Putin or do we believe NATO about who may stage this provocation?
[00:10:37.127 --> 00:10:38.147]  Well, who stands to gain?
[00:10:38.447 --> 00:10:43.286]   Who has a motive to bring this multinational force in right when the Russians are trying
[00:10:43.286 --> 00:10:53.286]   to mobilize and push back the already covert NATO commanded system with Ukrainian troops,
[00:10:53.286 --> 00:10:54.947]  contractors and others?
[00:10:54.947 --> 00:10:58.447]  So obviously, who stands to gain is NATO, is the globalists.
[00:10:58.447 --> 00:11:04.887]   They're the ones already putting out the red lines that there is any type of radiological
[00:11:04.887 --> 00:11:10.885]   or biological or chemical attack that they will have the pretext to then have open war
[00:11:10.885 --> 00:11:12.927]  with Russia already in a de facto war.
[00:11:13.744 --> 00:11:26.473]  So the globalists have the history, they have the motives, they have the background of doing things like this, and that makes them the prime suspects, just like with the destruction of the pipeline or the bridge, not the Russians.
[00:11:26.953 --> 00:11:28.394]  These are just facts.
[00:11:29.415 --> 00:11:37.477]  So we have to now pull back and ask, why would the multinational combine, the New World Order, the Davos Group, ally with Communist China?
[00:11:38.578 --> 00:11:41.679]  Why would they launch this war to begin with?
[00:11:41.739 --> 00:11:43.159]  Why would they escalate the war?
[00:11:43.219 --> 00:12:03.618]   Why would they put over 100 billion US dollars and over 20 billion euros alone into this proxy war with Russia that is now an admitted open war with the West, with US troops already dying, embedded inside Ukrainian forces. Because we're not in Kansas anymore. We're
[00:12:03.618 --> 00:12:07.998]   not in beta anymore. We are in operational mode of the Great Reset and the Build Back
[00:12:07.998 --> 00:12:17.227]   Better program. Now I talked about this last 20, I guess it's 30 months or more. It's longer than
[00:12:17.227 --> 00:12:18.017]  that now.
[00:12:18.159 --> 00:12:20.940]  Hard to believe so much time has flown since early 2020.
[00:12:22.641 --> 00:12:54.962]   I said, when they give people these shots, and when it causes heart attacks and blood clots and death, we know it's going to do that from our own documents, they're going to need some giant crisis so big, so horrible, so out of control in the future, that as those deaths mount around the world from the shots, We are already in a massive war, or a massive cyber attack that makes the power go off for several months, or I said a new virus they'll release that's so bad, they can then blame it on the people dying from the poison shot.
[00:12:55.342 --> 00:13:15.150]   But I knew that you don't pull off something like this, mass sterilization, mass heart attacks, massive cancer, massive blood clots, you don't pull off something like this, now confirmed, Without having an even bigger, more deadly crisis in the wings that will make you forget about the last thing they did to you.
[00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:17.551]  The way to kill a story is with a bigger story.
[00:13:18.011 --> 00:13:31.799]  So that's exactly what they're doing now, and it helps their entire agenda to smokescreen the world collapse, the energy prices exploding, the planetary inflation, by blaming Russia and claiming that that's the reason the energy prices have gone up.
[00:13:32.079 --> 00:13:36.342]   And we've seen them already do this, so we know They're carrying out this game plan.
[00:13:36.642 --> 00:13:38.864]  That's why it's so easy to predict what they're going to do next.
[00:13:40.305 --> 00:13:41.326]  So here's the bottom line.
[00:13:42.006 --> 00:13:43.107]  We are at war with Russia.
[00:13:43.967 --> 00:13:45.849]  The globals that control our country are at war with us.
[00:13:45.869 --> 00:13:51.332]  They're dissolving our borders, dissolving the police, crimes exploding, suicide, everything else.
[00:13:52.012 --> 00:13:56.811]   And they are directing the collapse of the third world through the lockdowns that ended a few months ago.
[00:13:56.811 --> 00:14:04.812]   They are directing a world crisis where the industrial carrying capacity of the planetary system collapses,
[00:14:04.812 --> 00:14:10.211]   causing mass starvation, death of the third world, explosive crime and poverty in the United States and Europe.
[00:14:10.211 --> 00:14:14.711]   And again, out of that, the new allure of technocrats will pose as the saviors,
[00:14:14.711 --> 00:14:19.512]   offering a solution, these new global digital currencies with universal basic income
[00:14:19.512 --> 00:14:23.832]   that of course have the social credit score and the carbon tax and it's all being rolled out.
[00:14:24.055 --> 00:14:25.056]  It's not my opinion now.
[00:14:26.221 --> 00:14:27.262]  What is the solution?
[00:14:27.802 --> 00:14:30.504]  What is the answer to counter this?
[00:14:30.825 --> 00:14:37.430]  I'll talk about solutions when we come back on the other side of the break and then Owen Troyer will take over.
[00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:41.413]  But please, whatever you do today, spread the word about this broadcast.
[00:14:41.533 --> 00:14:44.295]  Share this analysis once it's posted to Bandot Video.
[00:14:44.755 --> 00:14:50.600]  Because if more and more of the political system wakes up to what's happening, we won't sleepwalk into destruction.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.802]  It's a very small group of globalists at the top.
[00:14:53.361 --> 00:14:57.280]   that are orchestrating all of this. Most people in the political and corporate system are unaware.
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.442]  It's our job to wake them up. We'll be right back.
[00:14:59.442 --> 00:15:14.400]  World War III. David Petraeus says U.S.
[00:15:14.578 --> 00:15:19.401]  may lead multinational force against Russia in Ukraine.
[00:15:20.261 --> 00:15:27.425]  He goes on to say the force is ready and prepared, but it won't be NATO, just NATO backed and commanded.
[00:15:28.005 --> 00:15:30.347]  That is NATO in direct war in Europe.
[00:15:31.267 --> 00:15:31.968]  With the Russians.
[00:15:32.668 --> 00:15:34.370]  So what are the solutions to stop this?
[00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.412]  For all the great listeners of the Alex Jones Show today.
[00:15:38.293 --> 00:15:38.953]  Call Congress.
[00:15:39.553 --> 00:15:40.334]  Call talk show hosts.
[00:15:40.814 --> 00:15:41.895]  Call university heads.
[00:15:43.116 --> 00:15:43.937]  March in the streets.
[00:15:44.918 --> 00:15:45.498]  Protest.
[00:15:45.618 --> 00:15:46.179]  Demonstrate.
[00:15:46.739 --> 00:15:49.861]  Go confront right wing and left wing warmongering.
[00:15:50.902 --> 00:15:58.005]  Politicians like AOC and Ted Cruz and others that are leading us to the brink of World War III, nuclear Armageddon.
[00:15:58.805 --> 00:16:04.387]  Pray to God for justice in a worldwide awakening.
[00:16:04.407 --> 00:16:14.491]  And engage in information warfare using articles and videos from Infowars.com that detail all this, that predicted all this, to get it out to your friends, your family, your neighbors.
[00:16:16.091 --> 00:16:26.106]  Perfect strangers, and explain to them that this war is the smokescreen to bring in world government and a Mark of the Beast, cashless society that is already here.
[00:16:27.239 --> 00:16:27.619]  That's it.
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:32.381]  Explain to people this is a lot bigger than just a regional war in Europe.
[00:16:32.781 --> 00:16:42.465]  This could end civilization as we know it, but regardless, is being used as the cover for the engineered financial collapse.
[00:16:42.886 --> 00:16:44.926]  The globalists have built this giant Ponzi scheme.
[00:16:44.946 --> 00:16:46.627]  They've bought up almost all the resources.
[00:16:46.647 --> 00:16:50.069]  They've doubled and tripled their wealth the last five years by running these scams.
[00:16:51.329 --> 00:17:06.737]  And I said over and over again, they're going to use the virus and the poison shot rollout to destabilize and break down society, and then use an even bigger crisis like war and financial collapse and cyber attacks and power outages as a smokescreen for the last leg of their attack.
[00:17:07.497 --> 00:17:08.878]  And then what's the third leg?
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.941]  We've already gone through the first, the virus, and the deadly shot.
[00:17:12.981 --> 00:17:15.322]  Now we're going into the war and the energy crisis.
[00:17:16.122 --> 00:17:17.463]  And what is the third leg?
[00:17:17.483 --> 00:17:27.926]  Energy crises accelerating, power outages, cyber attacks, race war, giant third world terror bands, 10, 20, 30, 100 times bigger than the 3, 5, 10, 15, 20,000 person.
[00:17:32.848 --> 00:17:33.889]  Caravans we've seen.
[00:17:34.069 --> 00:17:43.137]  Caravans of millions completely flooding the Western world and bringing us to our knees with the UN overseeing it as the supposed saviors.
[00:17:43.838 --> 00:17:49.283]  I saw a video over the weekend of the world's UN food chief saying we need tens of billions of dollars.
[00:17:49.303 --> 00:17:52.546]  We've got hundreds of millions starving to death right now because of COVID.
[00:17:53.847 --> 00:17:55.228]  No, it was because of the lockdowns.
[00:17:56.249 --> 00:17:57.852]  That they implemented and that they carried out.
[00:17:57.932 --> 00:18:03.580]  Just like we now see Jake Tapper on CNN saying it's terrible that we made kids wear masks and didn't let them go to school.
[00:18:03.981 --> 00:18:05.623]  We hurt them mentally and didn't protect them.
[00:18:05.663 --> 00:18:06.084]  It's wrong.
[00:18:06.605 --> 00:18:10.470]  The very people that launched all this think that you don't have any memory.
[00:18:11.741 --> 00:18:12.642]  Think that you're stupid.
[00:18:13.062 --> 00:18:19.687]  And now they're coming back like the saviors, agreeing with you because the general public is awake and realizing who they are.
[00:18:20.327 --> 00:18:34.317]  That's why I've said hundreds of times, the key to understanding the globalists is having a long-term memory and remembering what they said one year versus the next, and how they play the good cop and the bad cop, sometimes the very same individuals that are engineering the crisis.
[00:18:35.077 --> 00:18:35.738]  Here's an example.
[00:18:35.778 --> 00:18:39.260]  They tell you, oh, man-made global warming made the Wuhan virus, not a lab.
[00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.902]  Oh, man-made global warming is the reason there's wars.
[00:18:42.382 --> 00:18:44.663]  Man-made global warming is the reason the third world's collapsing.
[00:18:45.164 --> 00:18:49.287]  In every case, it's been their policies that caused that.
[00:18:49.887 --> 00:19:04.657]  We've got to reach out to the people, not just of America, but the people of the world, and break down that this is a crisis of biblical proportions, as the smokescreen to bring down civilization as we know it, and build on its ashes.
[00:19:05.397 --> 00:19:06.618]  The globalist technocracy.
[00:19:07.378 --> 00:19:11.939]  Finally, before Owen Schroyer takes over, I want to thank the listeners for their outpouring of support.
[00:19:12.439 --> 00:19:21.522]  I want to thank all of the conservative and populist and nationalist media for their unprecedented defense of Infowars and the serious, serious fight we're in.
[00:19:21.882 --> 00:19:26.842]   And I want the listeners to understand the reason you now see these Democrat party ambulance
[00:19:26.842 --> 00:19:36.122]   chasers calling for $2,750,000,000 from this court is because they want to demoralize you
[00:19:36.122 --> 00:19:40.401]   and break your will and have numbers so big and so crazy, it makes you think there's no
[00:19:40.401 --> 00:19:42.522]  way Infowars can stay on the air.
[00:19:43.166 --> 00:19:48.150]  What you're witnessing is the exact same thing that we see in fiction in Wizard of Oz.
[00:19:48.791 --> 00:19:59.879]  In the Wizard of Oz you see the big screen and the big curtain and the big floating head screaming and yelling and trying to scare people and be all powerful when really it's a little man behind the curtain.
[00:20:00.519 --> 00:20:03.841]  Ladies and gentlemen, we will continue to be on air.
[00:20:04.602 --> 00:20:12.467]  We have a program to stay on air through Chapter 5, bankruptcy, that will allow us to continue on indefinitely.
[00:20:12.767 --> 00:20:15.769]  We have at least two years of appeal on these cases as well.
[00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:22.614]  That's why they want you to think we're being shut down tomorrow so you give up and stop supporting the broadcast.
[00:20:22.774 --> 00:20:27.077]  Now more than ever realize, in full words of the Sip of the Spirit, that's why enemies of freedom hate it.
[00:20:27.477 --> 00:20:28.518]  And that's why you should be sharing.
[00:20:29.358 --> 00:20:30.278]  The truth is, we have power.
[00:20:30.298 --> 00:20:31.979]  The truth is, the general public wants freedom.
[00:20:31.999 --> 00:20:33.439]  The truth is, there's a global awakening.
[00:20:33.259 --> 00:20:36.419]   That's why you should be sharing the live show feed with Owen Schroyer coming up and
[00:20:36.419 --> 00:20:38.178]  all the big guests he's got.
[00:20:38.178 --> 00:20:41.118]  Because that's what the enemy fears is the truth.
[00:20:41.118 --> 00:20:43.058]  The truth is we have power.
[00:20:43.058 --> 00:20:45.419]  The truth is the general public wants freedom.
[00:20:45.419 --> 00:20:47.298]  The truth is there's a global awakening.
[00:20:47.298 --> 00:20:50.058]  And the truth is the globalists are scared.
[00:20:50.058 --> 00:20:51.858]  So it's all a smokescreen.
[00:20:51.886 --> 00:20:53.046]  It's all smoke and mirrors.
[00:20:53.126 --> 00:21:02.133]  It's all the Wizard of Oz, writ large as a dying corrupt establishment, attempts to start World War III as a pretext to stay in power.
[00:21:02.754 --> 00:21:05.256]  No, their attempt to start World War III will not be our undoing.
[00:21:05.996 --> 00:21:07.037]  It will be their undoing.

[00:22:12.606 --> 00:22:13.887]  I'll have more reports coming up today.
[00:22:14.327 --> 00:22:15.228]  God bless my friends.
[00:22:15.608 --> 00:22:16.569]  Now's the time to be praying.
[00:22:16.609 --> 00:22:17.570]  Now's the time to be engaged.
[00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:23.094]  Now's the time to be exposed to the new world like never before because the public of the planet's minds are ready for the truth.
[00:22:23.374 --> 00:22:24.335]  God bless and good luck.
[00:22:27.515 --> 00:22:34.641]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are now broadcasting live from the InfoWars World Headquarters here in Austin, Texas.
[00:22:34.681 --> 00:22:35.422]  Owen Schroer with you.
[00:22:36.243 --> 00:22:44.289]  For the rest of the day, let me give you a program update on what we have coming up for the remainder of today's live transmissions.
[00:22:44.329 --> 00:22:46.972]  Guys, who is hosting the fourth hour today?
[00:22:49.946 --> 00:22:54.130]  So we've got the great Gerald Cilente hosting the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:56.172]  I'm going to be here with you until then.
[00:22:56.252 --> 00:22:57.694]  I've got two guests coming up.
[00:22:58.274 --> 00:23:16.316]   Drew Hernandez is going to join me in about 30 minutes to talk about his recent news coverage at the border and his crew infiltrating Biden events, infiltrating AOC events, and Perfectly executing their First Amendment right at those events.
[00:23:16.997 --> 00:23:29.291]  And then Savannah Hernandez in the one o'clock hour to discuss the sights and sounds from Portland, Oregon, where she followed around some drug addicts that did fentanyl.
[00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:37.815]  And then went to a Matt Walsh event in Nashville, Tennessee, where the liberal crazies were at it, as usual.
[00:23:37.895 --> 00:23:43.258]  And then, when we come back, I'll get into some of the latest news regarding the midterm elections.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:54.125]  Alright, for the next two segments, I'm going to get into the political news here, ahead of the midterm elections.
[00:23:55.856 --> 00:23:57.437]  And again, I have to emphasize this.
[00:23:57.758 --> 00:24:07.285]  I want this to kind of be the framing, to be the context as we go into the political news just 15 days out from the midterms.
[00:24:07.305 --> 00:24:08.987]  I'm starting to get a little bit excited about it.
[00:24:09.447 --> 00:24:15.132]  If anything, just for the closure of the event to happen and to see where the country will go from there.
[00:24:16.513 --> 00:24:18.094]  But here's the background.
[00:24:18.134 --> 00:24:25.320]  Here's the backdrop to me that I think is kind of the most important thing to observe and understand heading into the midterms.
[00:24:27.316 --> 00:24:37.644]  Anywhere you go, the raw human intelligence will tell you that the Republicans are going to have big victories and take back Congress in the midterm elections.
[00:24:37.744 --> 00:24:48.732]  I can give dozens of examples from my own real world experience and from what we're seeing as far as cultural movements.
[00:24:49.819 --> 00:24:52.218]  are considered. Let's start with the cultural movements.
[00:24:52.218 --> 00:24:59.408]   You've had the Blexit, black Americans leaving the Democrat Party. It's gained millions of
[00:24:59.408 --> 00:25:05.319]   followers. You've had the Legzit, Latino Americans leaving the Democrat Party. Gained millions of
[00:25:05.319 --> 00:25:10.779]   followers. You now have the Jegzit, Jewish Americans leaving the Democrat Party.
[00:25:10.994 --> 00:25:12.995]  That's gaining traction now as well.
[00:25:13.475 --> 00:25:14.976]  You've had the walk-away movement.
[00:25:15.496 --> 00:25:19.258]  Millions of liberal Democrats leaving the Democrat Party.
[00:25:19.278 --> 00:25:24.238]   You've got other groups that aren't necessarily political, but you know where their politics
[00:25:24.238 --> 00:25:31.037]   lie now, like gays against groomers with LGBTQ members that don't even claim to be part of
[00:25:31.037 --> 00:25:32.037]  that community.
[00:25:32.037 --> 00:25:33.037]  They just live their lives.
[00:25:33.037 --> 00:25:35.217]  They just want to live free and prosper.
[00:25:35.217 --> 00:25:40.817]   They are abandoning the Democrat Party policies and politics and will obviously not be voting
[00:25:40.817 --> 00:25:42.336]  Democrat.
[00:25:42.336 --> 00:25:46.897]   You've got huge influencers like Elon Musk saying vote Republican.
[00:25:46.897 --> 00:25:49.018]  Joe Rogan saying vote Republican.
[00:25:49.018 --> 00:25:54.557]  Tulsi Gabbard leaving the Democrat Party and so much more.
[00:25:54.557 --> 00:26:01.177]   So that's just kind of the cultural movements, political movements that you see.
[00:26:01.108 --> 00:26:10.453]  On an individual level, I don't know if you've been experiencing this as I have, but I just don't find any Democrat support anywhere I go.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:19.409]  And I understand that, you know, obviously I tried to avoid leftists, liberals, Democrats, like the plague for obvious reasons.
[00:26:19.449 --> 00:26:24.275]  For the warnings I give you, on the air, these people could go psycho at any given time.
[00:26:24.695 --> 00:26:26.637]  Literally, they could have a psychotic break at any given time.
[00:26:27.078 --> 00:26:28.380]  Like, for example, did you know...
[00:26:29.861 --> 00:26:43.950]  That girl who got famous, she was an e-celeb, she'd get on social media, get half-naked, and then support Bernie Sanders, and she had that famous OK Boomer video, do you guys remember that?
[00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:44.531]  Do you guys remember that?
[00:26:45.111 --> 00:26:48.874]  You know she got charged with violent assault of her ex-boyfriend?
[00:26:48.894 --> 00:26:51.776]  I'm telling you folks, these people can break at any moment.
[00:26:51.836 --> 00:26:53.156]  So the average person knows that now.
[00:26:53.617 --> 00:27:09.996]   But I go out in public, I have general conversations, With individuals and they all are just just like Democrat Party politics is like poison or it's like don't touch the lava like the game you used to play as a kid like oh jump around don't touch the lava.
[00:27:10.276 --> 00:27:12.658]  Democrat Party politics are like don't touch the lava.
[00:27:12.938 --> 00:27:15.079]  Yeah I don't like trans kids.
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.361]  I don't want to chop up little boys and girls.
[00:27:17.401 --> 00:27:18.042]  Yeah you know what?
[00:27:19.192 --> 00:27:22.895]  The issue of abortion is tough, but I'm not going to sit here and praise abortion.
[00:27:22.915 --> 00:27:24.937]  I'm not going to sit here and celebrate baby murder.
[00:27:25.317 --> 00:27:27.539]  We went out in the truck yesterday.
[00:27:27.599 --> 00:27:28.620]  You may have seen the video.
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:29.581]  It's up at Bandout Video.
[00:27:29.621 --> 00:27:31.162]  The HD video is at Bandout Video.
[00:27:31.182 --> 00:27:37.107]  The full stream, which is more than two hours long, two live streams, on my Gettr account at allidoizoan.
[00:27:38.048 --> 00:27:45.446]   Usually it's about a 50-50 split from the public response in support or They hate us.
[00:27:46.307 --> 00:27:53.013]  When we went out, and you can see it in the livestream, yeah, obviously you've got the people flicking us off and spitting at us and cursing at us.
[00:27:53.113 --> 00:27:54.174]  That's always going to be the case.
[00:27:54.494 --> 00:27:55.435]  It was busy downtown.
[00:27:55.975 --> 00:28:01.720]  But I would say nine of the ten people yesterday were in support of what we were doing.
[00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:09.326]  And we obviously, in the final upload video, you know, we show you the middle finger people and we show you a lot of people screaming because it's a little more entertaining, it's a little fun.
[00:28:10.467 --> 00:28:11.788]  To show how psychotic these people are.
[00:28:11.828 --> 00:28:18.913]  But the truth is, if you go watch the longer live streams that are hours long, you'll see that most people are in support of us.
[00:28:19.673 --> 00:28:21.214]  Most people agree with what we're saying now.
[00:28:21.575 --> 00:28:23.016]  I'm getting my hair cut today.
[00:28:24.278 --> 00:28:31.004]  And everyone in the barbershop, it used to be just me and my barber would kind of talk shop on politics and really get conspiratorial.
[00:28:31.484 --> 00:28:33.486]  Now everyone's getting conspiratorial.
[00:28:33.766 --> 00:28:39.151]  Now everyone's like, yeah, I used to think conspiracy theorists were crazy, but now I think you guys are right on about everything.
[00:28:39.611 --> 00:28:41.192]  That's how crazy it's become.
[00:28:42.613 --> 00:28:46.076]  Now I can go on, I've got other personal examples, but I'll just stop right there.
[00:28:47.068 --> 00:28:50.509]  And so, I'm sure you've been experiencing something similar.
[00:28:50.549 --> 00:28:56.652]  I don't think my life experience is too much different than yours, other than what I just go through for working here and being a talk show host.
[00:28:58.713 --> 00:29:02.394]  So everywhere you turn, everywhere you look, the awakening is certainly on.
[00:29:02.634 --> 00:29:09.797]  They've got another story in the Washington Post today attacking the Reawaken America tour because it's so popular.
[00:29:11.343 --> 00:29:14.824]  You don't have anything like this on the Democrat side of the aisle.
[00:29:15.064 --> 00:29:21.307]  There's no mass exodus of the Republican Party of any sect of the American population.
[00:29:22.007 --> 00:29:27.869]  You don't have any big tours promoting Democrat Party values that are going on that are successful right now.
[00:29:28.009 --> 00:29:29.489]  It just doesn't exist.
[00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:43.806]   So, I say that because you need to know that, you need to understand that, you need to remember that, and you need to know that You should believe your eyes, you should believe your ears, you should believe the world in front of you.
[00:29:44.788 --> 00:29:49.397]  Because part of the mainstream media is, don't believe your lion eyes, believe us.
[00:29:51.437 --> 00:29:58.121]  So if Democrats win in the midterms, they'll tell you, hey, ignore the facts that you can't find a person that votes Democrat.
[00:29:58.601 --> 00:30:01.783]  Ignore the facts that millions of people are leaving the Democrat Party.
[00:30:02.184 --> 00:30:09.348]  Ignore the facts that even in the midterm elections, in the primaries, more Republican voters turned out than Democrats.
[00:30:09.868 --> 00:30:15.892]  And when that all goes sideways in the midterm elections coming up in 15 days, they'll say, nope, this is legitimate.
[00:30:16.492 --> 00:30:31.718]   And just like in 2020, when you had a million people in Washington, D.C., Realizing the election was stolen from Trump, you will have that same phenomenon, except it will be millions more people that now realize our elections cannot be trusted.
[00:30:32.018 --> 00:30:33.618]  Now, I'm not saying people are going to go to DC.
[00:30:33.658 --> 00:30:34.778]  I don't expect that to happen.
[00:30:35.939 --> 00:30:37.459]  But I do expect the awakening.
[00:30:37.599 --> 00:30:40.079]  I do expect more people to realize it now than ever before.
[00:30:40.139 --> 00:30:51.990]   In fact, Ted Cruz was on The View today, and maybe we'll have this clip coming up, And they're attacking Ted Cruz about Republican election deniers.
[00:30:52.471 --> 00:30:54.112]  And Ted Cruz says, hey, wait a second.
[00:30:54.172 --> 00:30:58.236]  Hillary Clinton denied the results of the 2016 presidential election.
[00:30:58.276 --> 00:31:00.378]  Stacey Abrams denied the results of her election.
[00:31:00.418 --> 00:31:03.260]  And The View said, yeah, because those elections were illegitimate.
[00:31:03.901 --> 00:31:04.521]  Beautiful.
[00:31:05.582 --> 00:31:06.042]  Perfect.
[00:31:06.123 --> 00:31:06.903]  Thank you so much.
[00:31:07.244 --> 00:31:09.445]  So when a Republican wins, it's illegitimate.
[00:31:09.465 --> 00:31:11.407]  When a Democrat wins, it's all above board.
[00:31:12.208 --> 00:31:14.190]  We always knew that that was their logic.
[00:31:15.211 --> 00:31:16.031]  Now they just admit it.
[00:31:16.091 --> 00:31:18.773]  So Democrats are allowed to question elections.
[00:31:19.233 --> 00:31:20.093]  You're not.
[00:31:20.494 --> 00:31:21.914]  But let's look at Joe Biden here.
[00:31:23.175 --> 00:31:25.096]  Let's look at Joe Biden.
[00:31:25.116 --> 00:31:26.857]  Now he says he's running again.
[00:31:26.877 --> 00:31:30.498]  And I guess that's the truth.
[00:31:30.538 --> 00:31:31.899]  I guess he does plan on running again.
[00:31:31.939 --> 00:31:39.623]  They have started the Biden pack and everything you normally do in this time space to run for president.
[00:31:41.155 --> 00:31:46.301]  But here he is in a clip saying that he could drop dead tomorrow.
[00:31:46.682 --> 00:31:53.791]  So how can Joe Biden run for president in two years if he thinks he's going to drop dead tomorrow like he says here in clip two?
[00:31:54.452 --> 00:31:56.434]  So let's say Trump doesn't run again.
[00:31:56.454 --> 00:32:00.233]   Convince Aunt Gloria that She should stick with you.
[00:32:00.233 --> 00:32:03.354]  Well, I think, I think Gloria should take a look.
[00:32:03.354 --> 00:32:08.873]   I think it's a legitimate thing to be concerned about anyone's age, including mine.
[00:32:08.873 --> 00:32:10.713]  I think that's totally legitimate.
[00:32:10.713 --> 00:32:15.913]   But I think the best way to make a judgment is to, you know, watch me.
[00:32:15.954 --> 00:32:18.757]  Am I slowing up?
[00:32:18.897 --> 00:32:20.038]  Don't I have the same pace?
[00:32:20.058 --> 00:32:27.567]  And that old joke, everybody talks about the new 70s, 50s, all that stuff.
[00:32:27.386 --> 00:32:30.047]  of the new 70s, 50s, all that stuff.
[00:32:30.047 --> 00:32:34.986]   You know, I, you know, it could be, I'm a great respecter of fate.
[00:32:34.986 --> 00:32:36.466]  I could get.
[00:32:36.355 --> 00:32:39.635]  a disease tomorrow. I could, you know, drop dead tomorrow.
[00:32:39.635 --> 00:32:40.275]  No.
[00:32:40.275 --> 00:32:47.475]   But I, you know, in terms of my energy level, in terms of how much I'm able to do,
[00:32:47.475 --> 00:32:54.276]   I think people should look and say, does he still have the same passion for what he's doing?
[00:32:54.276 --> 00:32:58.115]   If they think I do and I can do it, then that's fine. If they don't, then they should vote against
[00:32:58.115 --> 00:33:03.475]   me. Not against me, they should encourage me not to go. But that's not how I feel.
[00:33:04.115 --> 00:33:06.756]  I can't even say the age I'm gonna be.
[00:33:06.756 --> 00:33:08.755]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, Joe!
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.721]  Hands to yourself, Joe!
[00:33:09.741 --> 00:33:13.683]  And then he goes in for the rub job on the neck of that reporter.
[00:33:14.163 --> 00:33:15.704]  He can't keep his hands off of people.
[00:33:15.724 --> 00:33:16.824]  He can't keep his hands to himself.
[00:33:16.844 --> 00:33:19.125]  And he says, am I slowing down?
[00:33:19.245 --> 00:33:20.066]  I'm doing great.
[00:33:20.126 --> 00:33:21.266]  My energy level's high.
[00:33:21.346 --> 00:33:23.147]  I could drop dead tomorrow, but vote for me.
[00:33:23.167 --> 00:33:34.192]  You know, I forgot to mention one other major factor of proof, I believe, that there is a groundswell of support for Republicans and not Democrats.
[00:33:34.292 --> 00:33:36.814]  Look at the ratings in the media.
[00:33:38.002 --> 00:33:46.287]  All the Fox News shows double and triple the audience size of all the other nightly news shows out there.
[00:33:46.707 --> 00:33:54.972]  I mean, hell, this audience, the InfoWars audience, which is, I mean, these transmissions have been completely banned across the internet.
[00:33:55.592 --> 00:33:58.854]  We have a bigger audience than most mainstream Democrats do.
[00:33:59.354 --> 00:34:04.937]  Like Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, they go launch podcasts and nobody listens.
[00:34:05.418 --> 00:34:05.778]  Nobody.
[00:34:06.954 --> 00:34:10.255]  They try to get 2.75 trillion dollars from Alex Jones.
[00:34:10.515 --> 00:34:11.695]  Our audience just gets bigger.
[00:34:13.155 --> 00:34:14.715]  But that's just a little addition.
[00:34:14.755 --> 00:34:17.776]  Now I want to get back to the subject matter.
[00:34:17.796 --> 00:34:21.777]  So you just heard Joe Biden say he could drop dead any day, but he's running for office.
[00:34:22.217 --> 00:34:23.617]  He said, look at my speed.
[00:34:24.137 --> 00:34:25.317]  Look at how great I'm doing.
[00:34:27.318 --> 00:34:28.818]  You forget where you are half the time.
[00:34:28.838 --> 00:34:29.938]  You're lost half the time.
[00:34:30.238 --> 00:34:32.258]  You spend a quarter of the time on vacation.
[00:34:32.678 --> 00:34:34.139]  Yeah, we've noticed, Joe.
[00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:34.819]  Believe me.
[00:34:36.141 --> 00:34:36.781]  We've noticed.
[00:34:38.302 --> 00:34:43.485]  And he gets confused again here talking about the student loan bailout.
[00:34:43.566 --> 00:34:45.247]  So this is going back and forth in the courts.
[00:34:45.307 --> 00:34:45.847]  It's illegal.
[00:34:45.907 --> 00:34:46.367]  It's legal.
[00:34:46.427 --> 00:34:46.968]  It's illegal.
[00:34:47.028 --> 00:34:47.488]  It's legal.
[00:34:47.548 --> 00:34:50.610]  It's just going back and forth in the courts like a ping pong ball.
[00:34:52.202 --> 00:34:53.663]  And the truth is, it doesn't even matter.
[00:34:54.063 --> 00:35:00.405]  The Democrat voter is so stupid that all Biden has to say is, I pass student loan forgiveness.
[00:35:00.445 --> 00:35:02.226]  And they'll just believe it, whether it happens or not.
[00:35:02.826 --> 00:35:08.069]  In fact, over the weekend, there were a bunch of the Democrat propaganda Twitter accounts.
[00:35:08.249 --> 00:35:09.629]  They all got invited to the White House.
[00:35:10.249 --> 00:35:12.710]  They get paid to promote Democrat Party propaganda on Twitter.
[00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:14.711]  Twitter then forces that into your newsfeed.
[00:35:14.771 --> 00:35:16.632]  Whether you follow them, block them, it doesn't matter.
[00:35:16.672 --> 00:35:20.834]  So everyone's getting Democrat propaganda forced into their newsfeeds.
[00:35:21.977 --> 00:35:28.919]  While Republican candidates are banned and can't even get into your news feed, it's just forced propaganda.
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:37.102]  And one of them said, oh, my daughter just got her student loan forgiven and now she's going to buy a new house.
[00:35:37.762 --> 00:35:43.204]  And then people were responding saying, but they didn't issue the student loan debt relief.
[00:35:43.244 --> 00:35:44.064]  It hasn't happened yet.
[00:35:44.585 --> 00:35:46.885]  And then that individual had to say, OK, yeah, that's true.
[00:35:47.406 --> 00:35:48.206]  Yeah, I made it up.
[00:35:49.172 --> 00:35:50.053]  They just make crap up.
[00:35:50.073 --> 00:35:53.515]  It's like, oh yeah, my daughter got student loan debt, forgive us, now she can buy a house.
[00:35:53.535 --> 00:35:55.035]  Yeah, it never happened, he just made the whole thing up.
[00:35:56.576 --> 00:35:57.177]  That's what they do.
[00:35:57.997 --> 00:36:08.003]  So now he's lying about the student loan bailout and saying it got passed in Congress, never went to Congress, never got voted on, but here he is claiming that in clip 6.
[00:36:08.723 --> 00:36:12.405]  Secondly, if you don't have one of those loans, you just get $10,000 written off.
[00:36:12.746 --> 00:36:13.266]  It's passed.
[00:36:13.346 --> 00:36:14.807]  I got it passed by a vote or two?
[00:36:15.487 --> 00:36:15.647]  No.
[00:36:15.927 --> 00:36:18.369]  There was no vote, never went to Congress, a total lie.
[00:36:19.799 --> 00:36:22.501]  And I don't think, I don't know if we have this one, guys.
[00:36:23.602 --> 00:36:26.565]  I don't see it on the video list, but I've got the news headline here.
[00:36:27.005 --> 00:36:30.548]  It was part of the same interview from before where he said he could drop dead from Joe Biden.
[00:36:30.968 --> 00:36:34.091]  Joe Biden on Kamala Harris, she's smart as hell.
[00:36:34.491 --> 00:36:36.693]  She has a backbone of a ramrod.
[00:36:39.455 --> 00:36:40.756]  Does anybody know what that means?
[00:36:41.516 --> 00:36:48.658]   Maybe we could ask Montel Jordan, or was it Montel Jordan that was running around with Bimbo Kamala?
[00:36:48.678 --> 00:36:48.838]  Yeah.
[00:36:49.318 --> 00:36:49.518]  Yeah.
[00:36:50.419 --> 00:36:51.599]  Kamala was looking good, wasn't she?
[00:36:52.079 --> 00:36:53.620]  Bimbo Kamala.
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:57.141]  Maybe he can tell us if Kamala has the backbone of a ramrod.
[00:36:58.721 --> 00:37:00.401]  Not sure what that means from Joe Biden.
[00:37:00.742 --> 00:37:02.162]  He might not be so sure either.
[00:37:04.523 --> 00:37:12.665]  Now, I'm going to come back to this issue later, maybe on the War Room or maybe later on the Jones Show, but I want to play the clip now before I get into the rest of the political news here.
[00:37:13.587 --> 00:37:15.047]  So your border is wide open.
[00:37:15.908 --> 00:37:17.888]  Record amount of illegal immigrants coming through.
[00:37:18.468 --> 00:37:20.009]  You've got record high inflation.
[00:37:20.369 --> 00:37:22.750]  You've got record high consumer price index growth.
[00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:24.750]  Record high producer price index growth.
[00:37:26.391 --> 00:37:29.132]  Violent crime is skyrocketing across the country.
[00:37:29.592 --> 00:37:31.372]  We've got supply chain problems.
[00:37:31.572 --> 00:37:35.734]  I mean, there's disaster on top of disaster on top of disaster here in the Biden administration.
[00:37:37.441 --> 00:37:39.743]  Biden has his priorities straight, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:40.083 --> 00:37:48.430]  And so he wants you to know that sex reassignment surgery and puberty blockers for kids is a top issue of the Democrats heading into midterms.
[00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:55.996]  So he brought in a man dressed as a woman to really hammer that point home here in clip four.
[00:37:56.016 --> 00:38:00.860]  Do you think states should have a right to ban gender affirming health care?
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:03.803]  I don't think any state or anybody should have the right to do that.
[00:38:04.781 --> 00:38:06.663]  As a moral question and as a legal question.
[00:38:07.323 --> 00:38:08.304]  I just think it's wrong.
[00:38:08.324 --> 00:38:10.806]  It's a big issue.
[00:38:11.387 --> 00:38:17.672]  It's a big issue is chopping up little boys and girls' body parts and aborting little babies and selling their body parts.
[00:38:17.692 --> 00:38:18.833]  That's what the Democrats are all about.
[00:38:18.853 --> 00:38:22.476]  So they bring a guy dressed as a woman to tell you how important it is.
[00:38:23.537 --> 00:38:24.758]  That's the Democrat Party.
[00:38:25.498 --> 00:38:28.601]  And they think that that's going to have them get political victories.
[00:38:29.001 --> 00:38:32.044]  And we all know that that's not what's going to lead to the political victories.
[00:38:32.184 --> 00:38:33.025]  It's the voter fraud.
[00:38:33.936 --> 00:38:36.660]  But I'll come back to that issue later because they really care about it a lot.
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:41.187]  They really like chopping up little boys and girls either in the womb or out of the womb.
[00:38:42.149 --> 00:38:45.534]  But here's some of the other news just two weeks out from the midterms.
[00:38:46.977 --> 00:38:49.756]   Chuck Todd Meet the press.
[00:38:50.176 --> 00:38:51.517]  New NBC poll.
[00:38:52.097 --> 00:38:55.399]  Red flag for the Democrats ahead of midterms.
[00:38:55.799 --> 00:38:56.999]  71% of Americans say U.S.
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:58.380]  is on the wrong track.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:38:59.921]  Boy, oh boy.
[00:39:00.261 --> 00:39:02.202]  What could make them believe that?
[00:39:02.942 --> 00:39:04.383]  The record high violent crime.
[00:39:04.423 --> 00:39:05.523]  The record high inflation.
[00:39:05.543 --> 00:39:07.804]  The supply chain crisis close to World War III.
[00:39:08.104 --> 00:39:08.965]  Wide open borders.
[00:39:09.285 --> 00:39:13.107]  Fentanyl overdoses becoming the leading cause of death amongst middle-aged men.
[00:39:13.567 --> 00:39:14.787]  What could it possibly be?
[00:39:14.807 --> 00:39:18.309]  Of course, all Democrat Party policies.
[00:39:20.208 --> 00:39:22.989]  And this is what they're really panicked about, and we're going to be monitoring.
[00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:42.359]  Apparently Merrick Garland, that goon, is going to be having a press conference in about 40 minutes or so about the upcoming elections, and they're going to probably claim that Russia's getting ready to steal it for the Republicans or something, or maybe they'll address the poll watchers, the ballot drop box watchers.
[00:39:42.972 --> 00:39:48.676]  New York judge rules that continued absentee mail-in voting based on COVID is unconstitutional.
[00:39:48.796 --> 00:39:53.900]  Now, if it's unconstitutional now, which it is, it was unconstitutional then in 2020.
[00:39:54.341 --> 00:39:54.681]  And it was.
[00:39:58.092 --> 00:39:59.433]  And that's what Trump was arguing.
[00:39:59.834 --> 00:40:15.627]  That's what we wanted to be presented on January 6th to Congress to say, look, look at all the unconstitutional rulings that were made just ahead of the presidential elections to get millions of mail-in ballots that shouldn't have counted and all this other crap.
[00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:25.227]  And that's why the Democrats wanted the violence that day, that's why the Democrats led the violence that day, stood down the National Guard, stood down the police.
[00:40:25.607 --> 00:40:28.549]  Nancy Pelosi had the documentary film crew ready to go.
[00:40:28.569 --> 00:40:33.833]  I mean, folks, that was the ultimate proof that the Democrats knew this whole thing and it was their operation from the beginning.
[00:40:34.254 --> 00:40:38.997]  Nancy Pelosi had a documentary film crew with her on January 6th to film all their madness.
[00:40:40.599 --> 00:40:41.499]  I mean, think about that.
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:52.436]   And let's say that, let's just pretend for a second That Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer had no idea that January 6th was going to go into violence like that.
[00:40:52.977 --> 00:40:59.022]  Why would they keep their documentary crew there and filming if it was an insurrection and it was so dangerous for them?
[00:40:59.442 --> 00:41:00.483]  They knew it never was.
[00:41:00.623 --> 00:41:02.285]  They knew they had control over the whole thing.
[00:41:02.505 --> 00:41:06.348]  They knew as soon as they sent out the emergency alert, everybody would went home just like they did.
[00:41:06.668 --> 00:41:10.511]  The Democrats ran the January 6th insurrection, not Donald Trump and Republicans.
[00:41:11.252 --> 00:41:19.921]  But now I'll be considered a terrorist for saying that and they may come bust into the studio and arrest me because don't you know we live in the Democrat Party fascist authoritarian state now.
[00:41:20.361 --> 00:41:27.108]  So okay, mail-in voting is unconstitutional now and it was in 2020 as well.
[00:41:28.169 --> 00:41:30.752]  Now here's what I think is going on.
[00:41:33.083 --> 00:41:46.076]  Because you probably saw, now look, there are multiple groups, some of them directly affiliated with the Republican Party, others just independent groups, that are watching the ballot drop boxes.
[00:41:47.057 --> 00:41:56.426]  And of course, this is all after the film, the documentary film, 2000 Mules, showed how cheating happened in the 2020 election with the drop boxes.
[00:41:57.642 --> 00:42:09.704]  Now these groups, none of them, all of them have the same policy, which is we don't confront any individuals that we think might be up to criminal activity at the mail-in drop boxes.
[00:42:09.864 --> 00:42:10.765]  We don't confront them.
[00:42:11.105 --> 00:42:21.407]  So for example, somebody drives up multiple times to the mail-in drop box with their license plate covered, they just film it, they just capture it on camera, and that's it.
[00:42:21.707 --> 00:42:23.067]  No confrontation, no nothing.
[00:42:24.676 --> 00:42:26.358]  And this is going on all around the country.
[00:42:26.378 --> 00:42:32.704]  The New York Times, the Washington Post, they've all written stories about how worried they are about that because they know they're going to use the mail-in ballots to cheat.
[00:42:32.945 --> 00:42:33.786]  And they're going to get caught again.
[00:42:35.174 --> 00:42:58.192]  So what they did, and this is what I believe, I believe because there's one group, there's one image now going everywhere of two supposed mail-in dropbox watchers sitting in military garb, full-on military garb, with weapons and their faces covered, and now all the Democrats are saying, look at this, Republican terrorists, look at this, voter intimidation.
[00:42:59.172 --> 00:43:00.834]  I believe that's a false flat.
[00:43:02.227 --> 00:43:22.399]   I don't know of any poll watchers, I don't know of any mail-in dropbox watchers that go out there and military garb and cover their faces and that's not what any of the groups that are running these mail-in dropbox watching Initiatives have told them to do they've always said no don't don't don't dress like you're in military.
[00:43:22.439 --> 00:43:36.804]   Don't cover your face Don't brandish a firearm don't confront these people and then those individuals somehow are the only two that have ever been Filmed ever been caught on camera, and then every Democrat is complaining about it To me, that has false flag written all over it.
[00:43:36.864 --> 00:43:39.865]  And if they make the press conference about it today, I think that confirms it.
[00:43:39.705 --> 00:43:46.245]   So until I hear from that group, those two individuals or somebody that claims that they were officially watching
[00:43:46.245 --> 00:43:51.575]   drop boxes for that group, I believe those are Democrat party operatives out there to
[00:43:51.575 --> 00:43:56.705]   start the narrative that Republicans are engaging in voter intimidation at the drop boxes.
[00:43:56.705 --> 00:44:02.705]  [Music]
[00:44:02.705 --> 00:44:06.705]  Everybody says they want people to stand up and fight tyranny.
[00:44:07.025 --> 00:44:09.690]  But when you fight tyranny, the new world order comes after you.
[00:44:10.171 --> 00:44:10.952]  Now, I knew that.
[00:44:11.774 --> 00:44:16.021]  And for 28 years, I've been on air exposing these people, and together we've had a great effect.

[00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:22.790]  They're trying to shut us down, but they can't beat the power of we the people, of you and I together.

[00:45:03.911 --> 00:45:10.330]   So Republicans, conservatives, Americans have organized after seeing the documentary film
[00:45:10.330 --> 00:45:17.571]   2000 mules, groups to legally, lawfully, peacefully watch, mail in, drop boxes to keep an eye
[00:45:17.571 --> 00:45:18.691]  out for any voter fraud.
[00:45:18.673 --> 00:45:24.856]  And they all have the same priorities, they all have the same initiatives told to them.
[00:45:24.996 --> 00:45:25.957]  We don't confront.
[00:45:26.757 --> 00:45:28.278]  We don't brandish firearms.
[00:45:28.318 --> 00:45:29.298]  We don't cover our faces.
[00:45:29.338 --> 00:45:30.339]  We don't do anything illegal.
[00:45:30.799 --> 00:45:32.020]  We do everything by the books.
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:35.381]  And if we see something sketchy or illegal, we just film it.
[00:45:35.502 --> 00:45:36.042]  That's it.
[00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:46.962]  And so now all of a sudden you've got this image that every Democrat is sharing, that every Democrat is complaining about voter intimidation on, and now I suspect Merrick Garland about to have a press conference on.
[00:45:47.482 --> 00:45:56.113]  Two individuals, brandishing firearms, full military garb, sitting outside of a mail-in drop box with their faces covered.
[00:45:57.199 --> 00:46:02.064]  Now again, no group has claimed that these individuals are working for them.
[00:46:02.565 --> 00:46:06.249]  I've not seen these individuals come out and make any statements about their activities either.
[00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:10.613]  So I'm suspicious that these are Democrat Party operatives out there.
[00:46:11.094 --> 00:46:24.202]   Now again, I don't know that, I just know that that's what the Democrats would do if they were afraid that their big voter fraud scheme at the Dropboxes was going to be exposed and shut down.
[00:46:24.622 --> 00:46:30.846]  They would find some way to shut down the Dropbox watchers and this would be the means to do so.
[00:46:31.847 --> 00:46:45.997]   So that's my suspicion here, especially after you've seen all the attacks on watching the mail-in Dropboxes and then every single Democrat sharing that image as if that's the only Those are the only two people that have ever watched a mail-in dropbox.
[00:46:46.017 --> 00:46:46.698]  That's not the case.
[00:46:46.938 --> 00:46:48.359]  There's hundreds of them out there, if not more.
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:56.848]  But the real question would be, why would you be so concerned about people watching mail-in ballot dropboxes?
[00:46:56.908 --> 00:46:58.289]  Why would that scare you so much?
[00:46:58.329 --> 00:47:00.652]  Well, the answer's obvious, because that's how they plan to cheat.
[00:47:01.997 --> 00:47:07.920]  Now Trump had a rally over the weekend in Rompstown, Texas and he said the problem with the U.S.
[00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:12.763]  media is that they won't talk about the massive corruption in the 2020 election.
[00:47:13.183 --> 00:47:16.105]  Well that's because they were a part of it.
[00:47:17.345 --> 00:47:22.448]  So of course that's because they were a part of it.
[00:47:23.592 --> 00:47:24.974]  We're looking at something very different.
[00:47:24.994 --> 00:47:27.437]  The press being part of the intelligence community.
[00:47:27.717 --> 00:47:29.760]  Lee Smith describes the latest roll of fake news.
[00:47:30.481 --> 00:47:36.068]  Yeah, you have to make the understanding here, and most in this audience already have, you have to make the understanding.
[00:47:36.589 --> 00:47:39.273]  You're not watching the news, you're watching...
[00:47:39.793 --> 00:47:40.974]  Party propaganda.
[00:47:40.994 --> 00:47:43.837]  You're watching state government, state propaganda.
[00:47:44.077 --> 00:47:53.385]  When you watch MSNBC, when you watch CNN, when you watch most of the nightly news programs, you're not watching news, you're watching fake news, but even fake news isn't the right way to cover it.
[00:47:53.425 --> 00:47:55.867]  You're watching state-run propaganda.
[00:47:56.828 --> 00:47:57.569]  That's what it is.
[00:47:58.189 --> 00:47:59.671]  Americans are starting to understand this now.
[00:47:59.931 --> 00:48:02.433]  So yeah, they were in on the big, on the big steal.
[00:48:03.914 --> 00:48:14.811]   That's why Ted Cruz ...gets Whoopi Goldberg to admit that when they deny election results, it's fine, but when you do it, it's bad.
[00:48:15.131 --> 00:48:19.433]  So here's Ted Cruz on The View getting Whoopi Goldberg to make that stunning admission right here.
[00:48:20.016 --> 00:48:25.855]   say the election was fair and square and legitimate. You know who y'all don't do that to? You don't do it to Hillary
[00:48:25.855 --> 00:48:28.016]  Clinton who stood up and said Trump stole the election.
[00:48:28.016 --> 00:48:31.016]   But they didn't form the Capitol. They didn't try to kill my former boss.
[00:48:31.016 --> 00:48:36.016]   They didn't do it to Stacey Abrams who said that the election was stolen. They sat here and said it was illegitimate.
[00:48:36.016 --> 00:48:37.016]  And it was.
[00:48:37.016 --> 00:48:41.016]   And you guys were fine with it. Okay, so it's illegitimate when Republicans win, but not when Democrats win.
[00:48:41.016 --> 00:48:46.755]   No, you know, here's the thing. We may not like when Republicans win, but we don't go and we don't storm. We don't
[00:48:46.755 --> 00:48:49.215]   try to change the- Oh, yeah, you do.
[00:48:49.215 --> 00:48:51.516]  Actually, you literally do.
[00:48:50.993 --> 00:48:52.274]  Look at Trump's inauguration.
[00:48:52.173 --> 00:48:54.653]  Look at the riots during Trump's inauguration, you liar.
[00:48:54.653 --> 00:48:59.534]   The Tefa riots where cities across this country were burning and police cars were being firebombed.
[00:48:59.534 --> 00:49:02.574]   Your position is the left doesn't engage in violence, really?
[00:49:02.574 --> 00:49:05.134]  No, they wanted to nuke our friend Mike Pence.
[00:49:05.134 --> 00:49:06.653]  Like, how do we make sense of that?
[00:49:06.653 --> 00:49:09.692]  You just accused us of doing something we didn't do.
[00:49:09.692 --> 00:49:10.653]  So there you go.
[00:49:10.653 --> 00:49:11.614]  They don't live in reality.
[00:49:11.614 --> 00:49:12.974]  They're liars, they're frauds.
[00:49:12.974 --> 00:49:14.173]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:49:14.173 --> 00:49:21.213]   Now, folks, here's what I think is kind of a big whale waiting to come to the surface here.
[00:49:21.869 --> 00:49:27.291]  Dominion voting system CEO caught in major lie on 60 minutes on his voting machine capabilities.
[00:49:28.252 --> 00:49:30.272]  Well, that's the story headline at the Gateway Pundit.
[00:49:31.133 --> 00:49:34.734]  I think Dominion is already suing Fox News for billions of dollars.
[00:49:35.555 --> 00:49:44.819]  I think I would not be surprised if Dominion starts going with the Alex Jones precedent and suing anybody and everybody who says anything negative about their voting machines for trillions of dollars.
[00:49:46.018 --> 00:49:48.201]  Do not be surprised if that starts happening.
[00:49:48.902 --> 00:49:52.006]  Why don't we just go back to paper mail-in or paper ballots?
[00:49:52.026 --> 00:49:53.849]  Just a paper, a pen and paper, a pencil and paper.
[00:49:53.869 --> 00:49:54.790]  Why don't we just go back to that?
[00:49:55.111 --> 00:49:55.571]  Good question.
[00:49:56.573 --> 00:50:03.136]  And we've got Drew Hernandez with us from Drew Hernandez Live, his great talk show.
[00:50:04.077 --> 00:50:05.878]  And Drew has been very active lately.
[00:50:05.918 --> 00:50:07.319]  He and his crew are doing great work.
[00:50:07.339 --> 00:50:09.420]  They're infiltrating Biden events.
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.941]  They're infiltrating AOC events.
[00:50:12.041 --> 00:50:16.343]  They were recently at a protest against Matt Walsh's event in Nashville.
[00:50:16.403 --> 00:50:17.564]  And so Drew joins me now.
[00:50:18.304 --> 00:50:20.665]  Drew, I'd like to talk to you about all three of these things.
[00:50:20.705 --> 00:50:21.406]  Where do you want to start?
[00:50:22.793 --> 00:50:23.993]  Wherever you want to start Owen, man.
[00:50:24.053 --> 00:50:25.114]  Great for having me back.
[00:50:25.354 --> 00:50:26.854]  It's always good to be with you, man.
[00:50:26.914 --> 00:50:29.134]  A lot of mental illness to go through, bro.
[00:50:29.555 --> 00:50:29.915]  A lot.
[00:50:30.475 --> 00:50:33.135]  Well, you guys are capturing it on camera, no doubt.
[00:50:33.275 --> 00:50:35.976]  Especially, we can talk about Matt Walsh's event.
[00:50:36.596 --> 00:50:37.616]  What is it about this?
[00:50:37.737 --> 00:51:14.720]   What is it about, you know... What is it about Matt Walsh or a conservative having an event that draws hundreds of mentally deranged lunatics out there, and then they think that this behavior is somehow Endearing to their cause or they think this is somehow going to help their cause and I don't see that at all Any neutral observer can see these people are deranged and filled with hate you sit there and watch it firsthand I mean do they ever try to explain that to you like I know you've asked before Like do they know that they're hurting their cause I mean look at that psycho good lord
[00:51:16.109 --> 00:51:18.710]  I mean, I mean, these people have severe cotton mouth.
[00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:21.812]  It's like, it's like falling into a black hole.
[00:51:21.932 --> 00:51:24.193]  I mean, you've been to these things and you know exactly how it goes.
[00:51:24.233 --> 00:51:31.056]  It's, it's quite literally like the soundtrack to hell, uh, when you go to this stuff and these people are the figures that are probably gonna go there.
[00:51:31.436 --> 00:51:34.578]  Uh, but I also will say is this, is this was a rally.
[00:51:35.293 --> 00:51:39.756]  To put a stop to the mutilation of the genitals of little kids and children.
[00:51:40.136 --> 00:51:50.402]  And so when you show up to something like that and you protest against that, you counter protest against that, you're either a pedophile, you're satanically deranged, you probably have some skeletons in your closet.
[00:51:50.862 --> 00:51:56.388]  I think you can pretty much see that these people, dude, this isn't like Trump's a Nazi anymore.
[00:51:56.488 --> 00:52:04.757]  This isn't like, oh, Republicans, we hate them and we're just gonna scream our heads off and everybody's a straight white male with your infamous clip.
[00:52:04.817 --> 00:52:09.322]  This is now, these people want to rip apart the bodies of little kids.
[00:52:09.875 --> 00:52:14.361]  And they sit there and they praise it, they defend it, and they call for it.
[00:52:14.381 --> 00:52:17.384]  They're a bunch of LGBTQ little mini Jeffrey Donners.
[00:52:17.725 --> 00:52:21.609]  I think the next step for these people is they're just gonna start eating genitals and eating little kids.
[00:52:21.629 --> 00:52:23.211]  I mean, I don't know, Owen.
[00:52:23.532 --> 00:52:24.433]  Like, where do we go from here?
[00:52:24.946 --> 00:52:26.627]  Well look, this is a progression.
[00:52:26.727 --> 00:52:33.950]  There's no doubt this is a progression of mental illness that we're witnessing here on the left that is certainly reaching new levels every day.
[00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:34.430]  You're right.
[00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:36.811]  The question is, where does it go from here?
[00:52:36.891 --> 00:52:37.931]  Where does it go?
[00:52:38.391 --> 00:52:47.575]  Screaming in the streets at random people is not going to give them whatever closure or whatever it is they're looking for in life, whatever dark energy they're searching for.
[00:52:48.035 --> 00:52:50.437]  Do they really love killing babies that much?
[00:52:50.477 --> 00:52:52.799]  Do they really love chopping up babies that much?
[00:52:52.859 --> 00:52:55.241]  Do they really love pedophilia that much?
[00:52:56.081 --> 00:52:57.823]  And, of course, you can't get an answer out of them.
[00:52:57.843 --> 00:53:00.244]  They just scream and shout and flick you off and everything.
[00:53:00.685 --> 00:53:06.149]  But, yeah, I mean, if this mental illness is not addressed for what it is, that's a fair question.
[00:53:06.269 --> 00:53:07.030]  Where does it go?
[00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:09.471]  Where does this mental illness go next?
[00:53:09.531 --> 00:53:12.173]  Because it's not going to just stay screaming in the streets forever, folks.
[00:53:12.474 --> 00:53:13.955]  It's going to go, like, Ed Buck level.
[00:53:15.475 --> 00:53:16.155]  I'll just say this.
[00:53:16.555 --> 00:53:20.896]  I think the next step is actual open pedophilia for these people.
[00:53:21.156 --> 00:53:23.477]  That's why they advocate for maps, right?
[00:53:23.617 --> 00:53:24.757]  Minor attracted people.
[00:53:25.117 --> 00:53:38.781]  That's why they have these brag shows with little children's bouncing on their on their on their on their hips and bouncing on their laps as if it's totally normal sitting there, you know, squatting and twerking and flashing, you know, their bulging genitals in front of little kids.
[00:53:39.041 --> 00:53:43.081]   I mean, when I was in Pride LA, they were literally speaking to little kids in the crowd,
[00:53:43.081 --> 00:53:44.441]  offering them lube.
[00:53:44.441 --> 00:53:51.201]   So I would say the next step for these people is out in the open pedophilia, where it's normalized,
[00:53:51.201 --> 00:53:54.081]  where they're not calling to try and make it normal anymore.
[00:53:54.081 --> 00:53:58.280]   If these people could have their way, it would be all over the mainstream media.
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:00.080]  It would be accepted on Disney.
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:04.559]   It would be accepted all over your TV, all over your social media apps,
[00:54:04.559 --> 00:54:07.181]  all over anything you could think of in your entertainment.
[00:54:07.181 --> 00:54:11.401]   If they could have their way, And there's a great clip right... Look at that!
[00:54:11.641 --> 00:54:16.563]  That's a great example of the total depravity these people want to take us into.
[00:54:17.003 --> 00:54:17.964]  And they cheer it on!
[00:54:17.984 --> 00:54:19.224]  They cheer it on!
[00:54:19.344 --> 00:54:19.725]  Exactly!
[00:54:19.745 --> 00:54:20.405]  They cheer it on!
[00:54:20.425 --> 00:54:24.547]  I had a record skip there because I wasn't aware of this.
[00:54:25.087 --> 00:54:28.688]  You were at an event where they were giving children lube?
[00:54:29.749 --> 00:54:33.210]  They were offering children lube at Pride LA during Pride Month.
[00:54:35.007 --> 00:54:37.729]  Uh, they were floating around on a float like it was Disneyland.
[00:54:37.769 --> 00:54:46.413]  This drag freak was, you know, they were going up and down the street on Hollywood Boulevard and one of them was literally communicating to the kids, offering them lube with the parents.
[00:54:46.453 --> 00:54:52.297]  They're just sitting there clapping, thinking it's all okay and liberal and progressive, but that's what these people are doing.
[00:54:52.337 --> 00:54:54.158]  They hide behind the pride flag.
[00:54:54.178 --> 00:54:56.339]  They hide behind the LGBTQ term.
[00:54:56.539 --> 00:55:01.842]  They hide behind the ability to be a protected class and they're going to usher in their pedophilia through that.
[00:55:02.262 --> 00:55:15.451]  People just need, that's literally what they're, to me, and I'm not saying this positively like I agree with it, to me, it's actually a good idea for the pedophiles because they get to just come in and be accepted in society, but that is what total depravity is.
[00:55:15.891 --> 00:55:16.992]  And that is how they're doing it.
[00:55:17.032 --> 00:55:19.513]  They're doing it through the LGBTQ banner.
[00:55:19.754 --> 00:55:23.316]  Well, see, but you just nailed their entire operation right there.
[00:55:23.496 --> 00:55:24.737]  That's exactly what it is.
[00:55:24.777 --> 00:55:28.200]  They don't really care about gay people, just like they don't really care about black people.
[00:55:28.501 --> 00:55:37.129]  You notice as soon as a gay person or a black person goes against their party politics, they hate them, they want them destroyed, they want them censored, they want them killed.
[00:55:37.609 --> 00:55:39.070]  So they really don't care about these people.
[00:55:39.411 --> 00:55:52.426]   You just know that all they care about is having the virtue signal and having that behind them so that they can hide behind that movement and then say, I'm an ally, or oh, I'm LGBTQ, and if you criticize me, you're a bigot!
[00:55:52.766 --> 00:56:05.702]  And then somehow that gives them the intellectual victory, and then that gives them the right, as you see in the video here, to pick up little children, dance with them on a stage like a hooker, half-naked, rub their genitals in their face, take money like they're strippers...
[00:56:06.643 --> 00:56:12.225]  And they just say, oh, this is LGBTQ pride and if you don't like that, then you're not an ally and you're a bigot.
[00:56:12.566 --> 00:56:14.466]  No, you're hiding behind that.
[00:56:15.047 --> 00:56:22.089]  You build that up as a victim group to make it untouchable so that you can get away with your sordid behavior right in front of the people's faces.
[00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:24.110]  That's what they do, Owen.
[00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:25.271]  I mean, really think about it.
[00:56:25.311 --> 00:56:31.219]   Take a look at Probably some of the most immoral, disgusting, depraved things taking place right now.
[00:56:31.639 --> 00:56:45.624]  You have this LGBTQ sick, twisted agenda that's going after the children, going after the minds of children in the classroom, trying to warp their minds and teach them about sex, anal sex, gay sex, whatever sex, whatever, it doesn't matter.
[00:56:45.664 --> 00:56:49.985]  They're trying to warp their minds, okay, and their innocence in the classroom.
[00:56:50.485 --> 00:57:01.840]  And then you also have the agenda that's taking it further and going after mutilating their genitals, telling them that they're not actually a biological male if they're a little boy, they're not actually a biological female if they're a little girl.
[00:57:02.261 --> 00:57:03.763]  Again, going after the children.
[00:57:03.783 --> 00:57:04.944]  Look at the common thread here.
[00:57:04.964 --> 00:57:10.308]   And then also, We have to always bring up the abortion conversation because that's always at the forefront.
[00:57:10.328 --> 00:57:17.651]  They want to kill children, murder children, mutilate children, and they want to sexually manipulate the minds of children.
[00:57:17.932 --> 00:57:21.613]  The next step, Owen, is they want open pedophilia.
[00:57:21.813 --> 00:57:23.494]  Let's just call it right now for what it is.
[00:57:23.774 --> 00:57:24.775]  It's been in the shadows.
[00:57:24.835 --> 00:57:26.456]  It's getting exposed in Hollywood.
[00:57:26.696 --> 00:57:33.559]  But right now, I think post, I would say 2021, 2022, they're pushing to normalize and make pedophilia mainstream.
[00:57:33.699 --> 00:57:34.699]  It's just clear by now.
[00:57:34.699 --> 00:57:38.699]   Well, and I think too, we kind of, you know, we almost have to check ourselves for a second
[00:57:38.699 --> 00:57:43.858]   because we see through the same Overton window that the public sees through in general.
[00:57:43.858 --> 00:57:46.418]  We just have the knowledge to know what we're seeing.
[00:57:46.927 --> 00:57:50.427]  If you move the clocks back, I mean, really, I would say 20 years.
[00:57:50.447 --> 00:57:59.969]  I mean, if you just go back to, let's say, 2002, if you saw this stuff in 2002, the average American, it wouldn't even be a debate.
[00:58:00.289 --> 00:58:04.250]  They would say, that's pedophilia, that's child abuse, lock them all up, give them the electric chair.
[00:58:04.610 --> 00:58:18.594]   So that just shows you how far they've moved the Overton window, that in two short decades, Behavior that would be considered child abuse and arrestable offense on the spot is now considered open and loving and LGBTQ gay pride friendly.
[00:58:20.095 --> 00:58:39.816]   Absolutely and this is kind of where liberalism and morality clash because at some point in a society a line has to be drawn because if we're just openly freely doing whatever we want in the sense of having no morals Innocent people get hurt in that process, and we can't get away from that.
[00:58:40.177 --> 00:58:41.678]  We can't shy away from that.
[00:58:41.998 --> 00:58:51.547]  This is why the concept of why the Bible makes sense when we're talking about morality within a society, because it always goes to one thing.
[00:58:52.047 --> 00:58:56.712]  Innocent being violated, and the most innocent people in a society are what, Owen?
[00:58:56.732 --> 00:58:57.432]  We both know this.
[00:58:57.692 --> 00:58:58.213]  Our children.
[00:58:58.493 --> 00:58:59.994]  And that's exactly where this is going.
[00:59:00.014 --> 00:59:01.175]  We cannot get away from it.
[00:59:01.396 --> 00:59:04.198]  And we have to come out and we have to be aggressively pushing back.
[00:59:04.238 --> 00:59:05.639]  I'm not saying violence.
[00:59:05.679 --> 00:59:07.441]  I'm just saying use your political power.
[00:59:07.561 --> 00:59:08.281]  Use your voice.
[00:59:08.702 --> 00:59:12.765]  Use the ability that you have to literally... This stuff has to be shamed, Owen.
[00:59:13.145 --> 00:59:14.286]  It has to be shamed.
[00:59:14.627 --> 00:59:16.969]  It has to be made a mockery in society.
[00:59:17.289 --> 00:59:21.853]  Otherwise, these people are going to continue to push this forward and attempt to make it normalized.
[00:59:22.529 --> 00:59:29.051]  And of course it's Joe Biden in the White House sniffing kids, grabbing kids, groping little boys and girls' genitals.
[00:59:29.131 --> 00:59:31.391]  Literally, folks, that's what Joe Biden does on camera.
[00:59:31.811 --> 00:59:36.852]  And I want to go back to the footage that one of your undercover guys caught of Joe Biden sniffing a little girl.
[00:59:36.872 --> 00:59:45.254]  Alright, I want to get back into the issue we're leading into here with the Democrats just moving for open pedophilia in public.
[00:59:45.274 --> 00:59:46.655]  They just want access to your kids.
[00:59:48.385 --> 00:59:56.892]  Folks, they literally want to be able to walk up to your kid and grab him like Joe Biden, and then if you say, hey, don't do that to my kid, they want to be able to take you to jail for denying the rights of a pedophile.
[00:59:57.987 --> 00:59:59.909]  And we've got unbelievable clips from Biden coming up.
[00:59:59.949 --> 01:00:07.276]  But you know, just to clarify something, Drew mentioned the foaming at the mouth that they do, or the cotton mouth.
[01:00:07.596 --> 01:00:14.102]  This isn't like you just went out and smoked a funny cigarette or you went out and smoked a joint and you got a little cotton mouth or whatever.
[01:00:14.122 --> 01:00:18.787]  No, these people are on serious psychotropic and antidepressant drugs.
[01:00:18.807 --> 01:00:19.567]  These are pill heads.
[01:00:20.288 --> 01:00:27.913]  It's it's one of the it's a main side effect of people that are popping pills to have that kind of cotton like weird Foaming at the mouth cotton mouth.
[01:00:28.293 --> 01:00:29.774]  I see it all the time at these events.
[01:00:30.515 --> 01:00:35.959]  It's well known that Americans are Addicted to antidepressants and big pharmaceutical drugs.
[01:00:36.359 --> 01:00:48.087]  I've got the data right here in front of me But yeah, that that's basically what it looks like the foam mouth the spittle Foaming at the mouth cotton mouth sometimes is what it's called, but it's much worse than that These people are all on pills folks.
[01:00:48.147 --> 01:01:02.616]   They're literally on pharmaceutical pills Which then gets into an entire new conversation about maybe it's the pill popping, maybe it's the pharmaceutical pills that are allowing these people to get brainwashed, but I want to backtrack from that and get back into the issue.
[01:01:03.517 --> 01:01:08.340]  Just a couple weeks ago, Drew's crew infiltrated a Joe Biden event.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:16.886]  You may remember it, but in case you don't, here's the video where Joe Biden creepily told a young girl what he claims to tell his daughter and granddaughter.
[01:01:17.206 --> 01:01:18.046]  I think I know why.
[01:01:18.327 --> 01:01:18.887]  Here's the clip.
[01:01:22.184 --> 01:01:30.368]  Now, a very important thing I told my daughter and granddaughters, no serious guys under 30.
[01:01:30.728 --> 01:01:31.889]  No serious guys under 30.
[01:01:35.051 --> 01:01:35.691]  So there it was.
[01:01:35.731 --> 01:01:37.692]  Now, why does he say no serious guys until you're 30?
[01:01:37.992 --> 01:01:40.253]  Because they're Joes until they're 30.
[01:01:40.593 --> 01:01:43.153]  He gets exclusive access to his daughters and granddaughters until they're 30.
[01:01:43.874 --> 01:01:46.014]  That's when he likes to get his jollies with them in the shower.
[01:01:46.495 --> 01:01:47.675]  And then he lets them go.
[01:01:48.055 --> 01:01:50.796]  But I'm curious, Drew, that was your guy that infiltrated the event.
[01:01:51.396 --> 01:02:04.340]  The gentleman, because it, I mean, I believed, I didn't know this, so I ask you now, the gentleman that came and said, hey, no filming, was that because he knew that he just got epic film of Joe Biden behaving like a pedophile and he didn't want any more of it out there?
[01:02:05.709 --> 01:02:07.291]  Absolutely, it appears so.
[01:02:07.331 --> 01:02:08.752]  So that was Kalen Dalmata.
[01:02:08.792 --> 01:02:11.815]  People could follow him on Twitter and get her at from Kalen.
[01:02:12.195 --> 01:02:14.618]  He actually infiltrated a private photo op.
[01:02:14.698 --> 01:02:20.563]  This was in California after Biden spoke to a group of people or attempted to speak to a group of people.
[01:02:21.164 --> 01:02:28.531]  And he infiltrated this, you know, private photo op and you could just see the uncomfortable look on that poor little girl's face.
[01:02:29.191 --> 01:02:36.493]  And, you know, they try to stop him because it was a private photo op, but the reason why they don't want any video going on is for reasons like this.
[01:02:36.913 --> 01:02:45.855]  Because they know that Joe Biden, this creepy, disgusting weirdo, does this kind of stuff whenever there's a little girl present, or a little boy present at that.
[01:02:46.216 --> 01:02:51.637]  He begins to walk up to them, he gets all excited inside, and the hands come out.
[01:02:52.042 --> 01:03:04.452]  The eyes get big, and then the- it's just like, dude, I show that to my mom, and you know, my mom, you know, has come a long way, you know, she was anti-Trump at the beginning, she's totally red-pilled now, and she's like, she's like, that can't be real.
[01:03:04.752 --> 01:03:08.055]  There's no way that's real, that's not some kind of meme.
[01:03:08.335 --> 01:03:18.683]  I'm like, no mom, that is a real video that is actually the puppet president of the United States groping a little girl, whispering into her ear, and probably sniffing her at the same time.
[01:03:19.604 --> 01:03:21.586]  But that's why they don't want people seeing this.
[01:03:22.106 --> 01:03:32.337]  That's why they try and stop it, because they know the regular sane-minded person takes a look at that and says, dude, that guy's probably a pedophile, get him the hell away from the kids!
[01:03:32.397 --> 01:03:40.926]  But because he's a Democrat, because he's the puppet president, because he's an elite, he gets a pass to just touch little kids out in the open in public.
[01:03:40.946 --> 01:03:44.049]  And it goes back to my point, Owen, they want this stuff to be normalized.
[01:03:45.222 --> 01:03:53.710]  And Joe Biden is the normalizer, if you will, if the president can do it on C-SPAN, then why can't I at a drag queen for kids strip show?
[01:03:54.170 --> 01:03:56.432]  And now, by the way, there's another image.
[01:03:56.532 --> 01:04:03.959]  Now, I mean, look, sadly, I've seen all of the Joe Biden sniffing little girls, grabbing little boys' genitals.
[01:04:04.059 --> 01:04:05.660]  I mean, little kids sniffing their necks.
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:09.063]  It looks like he's licking them sometimes, grabbing their ears, biting them.
[01:04:09.123 --> 01:04:10.324]  I mean, literally, folks, this all happened.
[01:04:10.544 --> 01:04:12.066]  One time he bit Jill Biden's ear.
[01:04:12.286 --> 01:04:16.204]   at an event. He bit her ear. I mean that's how out of control he is right now.
[01:04:16.204 --> 01:04:20.445]   But have you seen this new one? Because I was surprised I'd never seen this one,
[01:04:20.445 --> 01:04:24.365]   but I don't know when this happened. Have you seen the Joe Biden headbutt sniff
[01:04:24.365 --> 01:04:28.125]   of the little kid? Guys, put this one. Have you seen this one yet? Look at this one.
[01:04:28.125 --> 01:04:35.566]  Have you seen this one? It's like some kind of beast.
[01:04:35.737 --> 01:04:37.378]  Like some kind of, like, mating call.
[01:04:37.398 --> 01:04:37.859]  You know what I mean?
[01:04:37.879 --> 01:04:40.681]  It's like, this guy's, like, driven by his passions.
[01:04:41.021 --> 01:04:44.965]  Because he's so used to being around little kids and touching them and sniffing them.
[01:04:45.205 --> 01:04:47.367]  That little kid is all of us right now in America.
[01:04:47.387 --> 01:04:49.929]  Like, get the hell away from us.
[01:04:50.389 --> 01:04:53.132]  Get the hell away from me, Joe!
[01:04:53.672 --> 01:04:53.952]  No!
[01:04:54.013 --> 01:04:55.234]  The kid has the instincts.
[01:04:55.675 --> 01:04:57.597]  Just like the young girl in the video.
[01:04:57.737 --> 01:05:00.420]  The kid has the intuition, the instincts to know that's a predator.
[01:05:00.621 --> 01:05:02.964]  He goes to hide for daddy and then Joe gives the headbutt.
[01:05:02.984 --> 01:05:04.265]  Look at that deep sniff too.
[01:05:04.305 --> 01:05:04.626]  Look at that.
[01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:06.111]  Nosing him.
[01:05:06.491 --> 01:05:07.813]  He's nosing him, Owen.
[01:05:08.354 --> 01:05:09.635]  Oh, Joe Biden's such a freak.
[01:05:09.655 --> 01:05:11.457]  He's into nosing little kids on the back.
[01:05:11.477 --> 01:05:14.341]  Dude, this is- this is- Here's the thing, too, Owen.
[01:05:14.541 --> 01:05:15.462]  Do you ever- let me ask you this.
[01:05:15.723 --> 01:05:17.385]  Do you ever feel uncomfortable sometimes?
[01:05:17.405 --> 01:05:23.232]  Like, do you ever feel like, when you're watching these videos, and you're like, I gotta report on this, but should I show this?
[01:05:23.392 --> 01:05:26.343]   Like, is this considered, like, Like, CP?
[01:05:26.903 --> 01:05:28.984]  Like, do you ever sit there and you're just like, dude, what the hell is going on?
[01:05:29.004 --> 01:05:30.465]  Like, I... I don't know.
[01:05:30.505 --> 01:05:32.785]  I don't know if you... Sometimes on my show, I sit there... No, no, no, no, no.
[01:05:32.925 --> 01:05:33.846]  I totally understand.
[01:05:33.906 --> 01:05:40.008]  It's like, even watching the drag queen stripper stuff for kids is so disgusting.
[01:05:40.028 --> 01:05:42.669]  I mean, I wish we didn't have to cover it.
[01:05:44.389 --> 01:05:44.809]  I agree.
[01:05:44.850 --> 01:05:50.611]  And I don't want people to think like, oh, you just love this stuff because it's for a narrative and I always have to communicate to my viewers... So, but hold on.
[01:05:50.631 --> 01:05:50.832]  I'm sorry.
[01:05:50.852 --> 01:05:51.632]  Drew, I'm sorry to cut you off.
[01:05:51.792 --> 01:05:53.512]  Did they really just delete that thread, guys?
[01:05:54.493 --> 01:05:54.833]  Let me see.
[01:05:56.533 --> 01:05:57.885]  No, no, no, but that was a whole thread!
[01:05:59.431 --> 01:06:01.592]  The video I sent you, this is unbelievable.
[01:06:01.632 --> 01:06:02.552]  Drew, I'm not even kidding.
[01:06:02.612 --> 01:06:04.212]  This just happened.
[01:06:04.792 --> 01:06:06.353]  There was an entire thread.
[01:06:07.093 --> 01:06:11.194]  It was probably the best thread I've ever seen from George's Chillin'.
[01:06:11.674 --> 01:06:19.697]  It was like 20 or 30 tweets long, just documenting, unlike anything I've ever seen, all of the Joe Biden pedophilia events, all the different videos we've seen.
[01:06:19.997 --> 01:06:23.178]  He documented each one, each individual, each time, each date.
[01:06:23.578 --> 01:06:28.039]  That has just been nuked from Twitter as we were sitting here playing the video, Drew.
[01:06:31.882 --> 01:06:33.243]  You know why they do this?
[01:06:33.523 --> 01:06:34.383]  We all know why they do this.
[01:06:34.403 --> 01:06:39.285]  They do this because when people see this, they see it for what it truly is.
[01:06:39.705 --> 01:06:41.346]  This is why they need censorship.
[01:06:41.366 --> 01:06:43.287]  This is why they need to deplatform things.
[01:06:43.527 --> 01:06:45.668]  This is why they need to suppress things that come out.
[01:06:45.908 --> 01:06:47.289]  Because this is the reality.
[01:06:47.529 --> 01:06:50.110]  This is the reality of what went to the White House.
[01:06:50.805 --> 01:07:00.033]  We got a pedophile in there that goes after children, that sniffs little boys on their backs, that gropes young teenage girls and whispers in their ears like it's totally normal.
[01:07:00.053 --> 01:07:03.136]  See, this is the reality of what America has become.
[01:07:03.416 --> 01:07:06.519]  The total depravity is on full, full display.
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:14.426]  And people see this, Owen, and Big Tech has to silence it because they need to hide their pedophilia because they know that people wake up to this.
[01:07:14.607 --> 01:07:17.049]  Listen, this is still a good sign, Owen.
[01:07:17.529 --> 01:07:18.891]  And bear with me for the viewers.
[01:07:19.051 --> 01:07:23.235]  It's a good sign when we see this because we know that people are still waking up.
[01:07:23.275 --> 01:07:29.561]  We'd be in a lot of trouble if the majority of this country was accepting this garbage and was praising it as well.
[01:07:29.601 --> 01:07:35.927]  I still believe it's kind of like a fringe, disgusting little minority and a bunch of people that are afraid to get cancelled to speak out against it.
[01:07:36.247 --> 01:07:37.849]  It's good that we expose this.
[01:07:37.949 --> 01:07:41.893]  It's good that it comes out because people still have a moral compass, thank God.
[01:07:42.293 --> 01:07:43.153]  And it needs to be seen.
[01:07:43.173 --> 01:07:44.694]  That's why InfoWars is important as well.
[01:07:44.854 --> 01:07:47.975]  That's why they want to take down InfoWars, because this stuff continues to get exposed.
[01:07:48.995 --> 01:07:58.639]  And the craziest part about it too is, like you said, I get why, I think you were talking about your mother, I get why she can't believe this stuff.
[01:07:58.979 --> 01:08:00.800]  I understand why people doubt this stuff.
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:02.040]  I don't want to believe this stuff.
[01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:03.621]  I just have to look at it every day.
[01:08:04.421 --> 01:08:09.325]  You see Joe Biden grabbing and sniffing little girls in a 30 minute compilation video.
[01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:11.067]  It's undeniable.
[01:08:11.107 --> 01:08:17.452]  There is a pattern of behavior here and it's getting worse in his old age as his dementia and Alzheimer's get worse.
[01:08:17.772 --> 01:08:19.994]  He can't even control himself, folks.
[01:08:20.294 --> 01:08:23.317]  He's giving nose rubs to strange kids.
[01:08:24.962 --> 01:08:26.885]  And the great Drew Hernandez.
[01:08:27.427 --> 01:08:31.535]  DrewHLive.com at Drew H Live on Twitter.
[01:08:31.956 --> 01:08:34.601]  Host of the Frontlines with Drew Hernandez doing such great work.
[01:08:34.661 --> 01:08:35.062]  Now Drew...
[01:08:36.348 --> 01:08:41.292]  I don't want to go into paranoid schizophrenic territory here, but we all witnessed what happened.
[01:08:41.352 --> 01:08:42.993]  So it was on the screen.
[01:08:43.273 --> 01:08:47.336]  We all saw on the screen that the tweet thread was removed.
[01:08:47.576 --> 01:08:48.937]  We all saw that on the screen.
[01:08:49.057 --> 01:08:50.198]  We documented it on the screen.
[01:08:50.818 --> 01:08:56.542]  I go into the control room during the break and I'm like, hey, is there any way I have it on my phone here?
[01:08:56.582 --> 01:08:57.663]  They haven't blocked it on my phone.
[01:08:57.683 --> 01:08:59.724]  If we do a doc cam, we can just show this on my phone.
[01:09:00.085 --> 01:09:00.725]  And oh, okay.
[01:09:00.765 --> 01:09:01.746]  And then they go back to the tweet.
[01:09:01.826 --> 01:09:02.947]  Now it's back live.
[01:09:03.487 --> 01:09:04.728]  So I don't know what's going on.
[01:09:04.748 --> 01:09:05.429]  I don't know.
[01:09:05.569 --> 01:09:07.691]  You know, again, like, are they watching InfoWars?
[01:09:07.731 --> 01:09:08.851]  Like, oh, they're about to show this.
[01:09:08.892 --> 01:09:09.432]  Let's ban it.
[01:09:09.692 --> 01:09:10.993]  Oh, no, they just said we're banning it.
[01:09:11.033 --> 01:09:11.654]  Let's unban it.
[01:09:12.194 --> 01:09:12.474]  I'm not.
[01:09:13.115 --> 01:09:15.257]  I mean, I feel like I'm going crazy here.
[01:09:15.517 --> 01:09:17.899]  The point is, the tweet thread is back up.
[01:09:17.939 --> 01:09:32.834]   So I want to put this all on the screen and just scroll through this slowly, guys, for documentary purposes, in case they do remove Geo White's Twitter thread, because it's one of the most powerful exhibits About what Joe Biden has done inappropriately, touching girls, including the one famous video where he does a titty twister.
[01:09:32.854 --> 01:09:34.737]  I mean, that's what he gives a girl, a titty twister, folks.
[01:09:34.757 --> 01:09:38.862]  And I'm trying to, it's like, it's not like two kids on the playground having fun, like, oh, titty twister, huh?
[01:09:39.103 --> 01:09:42.527]  No, Joe Biden sneaks up behind a young girl and gives her, oh my gosh.
[01:09:44.594 --> 01:09:47.958]  So, but there it is, Drew, but I was getting into this in the last segment, I kind of want to get your thoughts.
[01:09:48.519 --> 01:09:56.087]  I understand why people can't believe this stuff, and this is why I've kind of always said, you can't, it's impossible to wake somebody up.
[01:09:56.688 --> 01:10:04.797]  You have to give, you can give them breadcrumbs, you can give them a trail, if you will, you can kind of give them clues, but at the end of the day, it has to be their own awakening.
[01:10:04.977 --> 01:10:06.278]  They have to experience it.
[01:10:06.378 --> 01:10:08.499]  They have to land on the conclusion that this stuff is real.
[01:10:08.839 --> 01:10:09.959]  You can't convince them.
[01:10:10.499 --> 01:10:12.680]  And so, I mean, how many different examples are there?
[01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:20.584]  If it's not Joe Biden sniffing and groping kids, I mean, the wide-open borders, the inflation, the violent crime, the Antifa riots.
[01:10:20.604 --> 01:10:22.385]  They get to question elections, but you don't.
[01:10:22.785 --> 01:10:27.367]  I mean, it's just, on all aspects, I see people awakening unlike I've ever seen before.
[01:10:28.826 --> 01:10:31.547]  Unfortunately, that's how human behavior functions.
[01:10:31.947 --> 01:10:43.070]  And unfortunately, it's either you're going to learn through wisdom and knowledge and make some educated decisions preemptively to avoid a disaster, or you've got to go through the disaster and learn the hard way.
[01:10:43.090 --> 01:10:51.032]  And unfortunately, we have people in this country that don't want to listen, that are afraid of getting canceled, that are afraid of just standing up for what is true and what is right.
[01:10:51.072 --> 01:10:52.632]  Not all the viewers and the InfoWarriors.
[01:10:53.172 --> 01:10:59.774]  Talking about the cowards out there that just continue to peddle this stuff and allow it to go on, that are unafraid to draw a line in the sand.
[01:10:59.834 --> 01:11:01.595]  Right now, lines have to be drawn.
[01:11:01.895 --> 01:11:04.276]  Because there's innocence that is being violated right now.
[01:11:04.296 --> 01:11:05.797]  And there's innocence that is at stake.
[01:11:05.817 --> 01:11:11.499]  And obviously, at the top of it all is our country, is the United States of America, humanity as a whole.
[01:11:11.519 --> 01:11:16.400]  And that's where the World Economic Forum and the Klaus Schwab's and the globalist agenda comes in from the top down.
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:17.801]  This is where this is all coming from.
[01:11:18.161 --> 01:11:24.743]  The economy, the social revamping and structures, they all talk about this, especially the replacement migration.
[01:11:24.763 --> 01:11:26.824]  This is all a WEF agenda.
[01:11:26.884 --> 01:11:33.966]  And when people start to wake up to that, I mean, here's the thing, a lot of people will say, oh, the New World Order, that's just some kind of Christian conspiracy theory.
[01:11:34.066 --> 01:11:35.566]  Oh, you just sound like Alex Jones.
[01:11:35.606 --> 01:11:40.908]  He's been saying that for decades, and it's just a bunch of garbage, Illuminati this, New World Order that.
[01:11:41.348 --> 01:11:43.508]  It's a one world religion, one world government that.
[01:11:44.329 --> 01:11:44.849]  Is it really?
[01:11:44.909 --> 01:11:56.576]   It's like, look, We've come to a place, and Alex has been saying this for years, you could read their writings and go and read their books, they're open about this stuff, but now people could literally go to the World Economic Forum website.
[01:11:56.817 --> 01:11:58.758]  You can read all of their thoughts.
[01:11:59.218 --> 01:12:02.701]  You can read their entire agenda for 2030 to 2050.
[01:12:02.941 --> 01:12:04.662]  I think it's out like a hundred years.
[01:12:05.102 --> 01:12:10.226]  Everything these people want to do, they have it systemically planned, not just for the U.S.
[01:12:10.986 --> 01:12:11.987]  For the entire globe.
[01:12:12.367 --> 01:12:13.907]  You can see it across the entire board.
[01:12:13.947 --> 01:12:15.948]  Klaus Schwab comes out and makes statements like this.
[01:12:16.348 --> 01:12:23.091]  We need to revamp the economic and social structures of the West and the entire world, the entire globe.
[01:12:23.331 --> 01:12:25.852]  That is why you're seeing everything falling to pieces.
[01:12:26.132 --> 01:12:32.815]  That's why they're putting out the Build Back Better Great Reset Agenda, because you need a controlled demolition in order to build it back up.
[01:12:32.915 --> 01:12:38.057]  Not just the economy, but also the social fabric of a nation and a society as well.
[01:12:38.077 --> 01:12:43.321]   So all of this, all of this, is a controlled demolition so these people can have top-down control.
[01:12:43.361 --> 01:12:44.843]  It's not a conspiracy theory anymore.
[01:12:45.063 --> 01:12:46.044]  Go to the freaking website.
[01:12:46.064 --> 01:12:46.764]  They're open about it.
[01:12:46.784 --> 01:12:48.206]  You can go to Davos yourself.
[01:12:48.546 --> 01:12:56.093]  You can watch it on freaking YouTube at this point and listen to these psychopaths, these homicidal maniacs, planning your future and your life.
[01:12:56.433 --> 01:12:59.736]  Oh, and then the left wants to come out and say, oh, we care so much about democracy.
[01:13:00.017 --> 01:13:00.777]  Well, what about them?
[01:13:01.037 --> 01:13:02.499]  Who the hell elected Bill Gates?
[01:13:02.939 --> 01:13:04.442]  Who the hell elected Klaus Schwab?
[01:13:04.642 --> 01:13:07.747]  Why doesn't the left call them out and they claim to care about democracy?
[01:13:07.987 --> 01:13:14.517]  Then call these people out that are unelected that are coming out and making decisions for your life in this country that you live in.
[01:13:14.818 --> 01:13:15.759]  But they're silent on that.
[01:13:15.799 --> 01:13:16.000]  Why?
[01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:16.861]  We all know why.
[01:13:16.881 --> 01:13:17.943]  It goes back to the money.
[01:13:18.223 --> 01:13:22.145]  Yeah, and because, of course, if it can't be applied universally, it's not logic, it's propaganda.
[01:13:22.185 --> 01:13:23.006]  It's all propaganda.
[01:13:23.326 --> 01:13:28.169]  And that's what's so frustrating, too, because you understand, you mentioned the social fabric.
[01:13:28.809 --> 01:13:32.392]  Part of the Great Reset is to destroy the social fabric so that they can remake it.
[01:13:32.412 --> 01:13:33.572]  And that's what's so frustrating.
[01:13:33.592 --> 01:13:43.879]  It's like, when you go out and you're dealing with these drag queens, stripper time for kids, or trying to stop the general mutilation of children, it's not just to protect the children.
[01:13:43.919 --> 01:13:47.100]  That's the front lines of us saying, hey, let's protect the children.
[01:13:48.422 --> 01:13:51.669]  It's to make people understand this is part of a bigger agenda.
[01:13:51.709 --> 01:13:53.512]  This isn't just happening through osmosis.
[01:13:53.532 --> 01:13:54.875]  This isn't a natural occurrence.
[01:13:54.895 --> 01:13:56.318]  This is being forced upon you.
[01:13:56.999 --> 01:13:58.623]  And what's incredible about it now is...
[01:14:00.017 --> 01:14:06.198]  Again, how anybody could stand and say, I support chopping off little boys and girls' genitals.
[01:14:06.398 --> 01:14:09.099]  I stand for chopping off little girls' breasts.
[01:14:09.179 --> 01:14:10.559]  I think that's a great thing.
[01:14:10.979 --> 01:14:15.000]  That is completely insane, let alone drag queen stripper time for kids.
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:17.080]  That's like just one level better, I guess.
[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:19.121]  I guess one level worse is actually mutilating them.
[01:14:20.041 --> 01:14:23.862]  Then one level less worse is just dancing naked and stripping in front of them.
[01:14:24.442 --> 01:14:26.102]  And you say, how can you support that?
[01:14:26.582 --> 01:14:32.727]  They've fully bought into this, Drew, and I don't think they actually buy into genital mutilation of children.
[01:14:32.807 --> 01:14:35.409]  I don't think they actually buy into drag queen stripper time for kids.
[01:14:35.890 --> 01:14:44.217]  They've bought into the larger idea of hate everything traditional, hate Christians, hate America, just hate, hate, hate.
[01:14:44.617 --> 01:14:51.665]  And then you have all these things that they hate and so now their entire motive of operation is, I'm just going to do things that you hate.
[01:14:52.005 --> 01:14:55.509]  So I'm going to promote chopping up little boys and girls because you hate it.
[01:14:55.849 --> 01:14:58.272]  I'm going to promote abortion because you hate it.
[01:14:58.572 --> 01:15:02.737]  So it's not even coming from a place of what they believe, it's coming from a place of hate.
[01:15:04.375 --> 01:15:06.336]  Absolutely, and I'll prove it to you, right?
[01:15:06.356 --> 01:15:27.004]   So when we were at the rally in Nashville on Friday, two detransitioners, and Chloe was one of them, we need to really continue to platform people that are detransitioning, not because it fits the narrative, not because it fits, you know, the pushback that we want against the But because it's the reality of what happens to someone
[01:15:27.004 --> 01:15:30.324]  that goes through that nightmare and buys that lie.
[01:15:30.324 --> 01:15:37.064]   When you see the reaction that these people have against these kids that are detransitioning, I'm talking like young
[01:15:37.064 --> 01:15:39.324]  people, the demons come out even more.
[01:15:40.189 --> 01:15:41.330]  It is full hatred.
[01:15:42.091 --> 01:15:43.251]  They call them fascists.
[01:15:43.271 --> 01:15:44.272]  They call them evil.
[01:15:44.552 --> 01:15:47.654]  They call them the most slanderous things you could possibly think of.
[01:15:47.895 --> 01:15:50.676]  The people that were once championed by that one community.
[01:15:50.897 --> 01:15:54.119]  In the name of love and tolerance and LGBTQ acceptance.
[01:15:54.679 --> 01:15:55.440]  Oh, diversity.
[01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:56.540]  We just love everybody.
[01:15:56.901 --> 01:15:57.501]  The moment.
[01:15:57.681 --> 01:15:58.802]  And I think it's even worse.
[01:15:59.485 --> 01:16:10.431]  I'm gonna be honest here, I think it's even worse than just a Democrat going over to the right like Tulsi, or a black person that's kind of defecting from leftist thought, or a brown person, or whatever.
[01:16:10.451 --> 01:16:33.157]   I think these detransitioners are getting it even worse because this is so satanic, it's evil at its core, and when people see that, People see that someone that was once championed by this community, this cause that they care so much, get absolutely obliterated and slandered publicly and their other eyes start turning black and rolling behind their heads and the foam gets worse.
[01:16:33.698 --> 01:16:34.880]  That is the key right there.
[01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:43.426]  The key is that, is platforming people that are detransitioning, not for a narrative, but to show the reality of what this is doing to this generation.
[01:16:43.726 --> 01:16:46.768]  Those are the ones that are going to save this generation, and I'll tell you why.
[01:16:47.028 --> 01:16:53.853]  Because they've gone through it, they've suffered through it, they've learned, and they need to be platformed so they can voice just exactly what happened.
[01:16:54.313 --> 01:17:00.064]   Because they are the ones that can speak to this generation, and I think when people see the attack, That wakes people up big time.
[01:17:00.244 --> 01:17:01.805]  Oh, that was the main thing.
[01:17:01.825 --> 01:17:09.469]  I had a detransitioned individual in studio with me last week and that was the main thing that grabbed my attention when he was telling me the story.
[01:17:09.509 --> 01:17:10.990]  This is before we took it to air.
[01:17:11.550 --> 01:17:13.612]  The main thing that grabbed my attention was how...
[01:17:14.687 --> 01:17:35.764]  When he was considering going through the process of being trans, man to woman, and when he was considering what types of, you know, either surgeries or chemicals he would take in that process, he was really hesitant, and then he was kind of hesitant with the chemicals, then he was kind of hesitant with the surgeries, and then he got to a point where he just didn't want any of it.
[01:17:36.224 --> 01:17:40.387]  And the shocking part about me was he told me he was like, he never had more hatred in his life.
[01:17:40.767 --> 01:17:48.553]  He was like, when he thought he wanted to be trans to a woman, and when he was considering those things, oh it was open, open minds, open hearts, open arms.
[01:17:48.873 --> 01:17:53.656]  But as soon as he was kind of saying, you know what, maybe I don't want to do this, the hatred started to flow.
[01:17:54.157 --> 01:17:55.658]  The hatred started to flow deep.
[01:17:55.698 --> 01:17:56.679]  There's something there.
[01:17:57.940 --> 01:17:59.661]  Quick breaking news update here.
[01:18:00.081 --> 01:18:04.008]   There has been A school shooting in St.
[01:18:04.088 --> 01:18:04.468]  Louis.
[01:18:05.009 --> 01:18:22.102]  The event has ended now and three are ruled dead including the shooter and I believe at least eight others wounded inside Central Vision and Performing Arts High School in St.
[01:18:22.242 --> 01:18:22.622]  Louis.
[01:18:23.143 --> 01:18:24.444]  And so this is very sad.
[01:18:25.934 --> 01:18:34.482]  And I remember something that Rush Limbaugh used to say all the time in response to this with the left calling to grab the guns.
[01:18:36.043 --> 01:18:40.988]  The next school shooter is already out there and whatever laws you write are not going to stop him.
[01:18:42.168 --> 01:18:43.369]  And that's just the truth, folks.
[01:18:44.309 --> 01:18:56.516]  And with my next guest, who's coming up next hour, Savannah Hernandez, she got into a talk with some anti-gun students who want gun-free zones, and she said, well, if you're in a gun-free zone and someone comes in with a gun, what do you do?
[01:18:57.576 --> 01:18:58.577]  They don't have an answer for that.
[01:18:59.237 --> 01:19:00.338]  Because it doesn't make sense.
[01:19:00.798 --> 01:19:02.039]  That's why you should be armed.
[01:19:02.079 --> 01:19:03.260]  So this is a tragic thing.
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:05.641]  I don't know of the security at that school.
[01:19:07.298 --> 01:19:21.722]  But I believe, sadly, if we have to stop school shootings, I believe the thing to do is to have a trained armed guard, heavily trained armed guard, a master marksman at these schools.
[01:19:21.842 --> 01:19:22.962]  There's veterans that'll do it.
[01:19:23.042 --> 01:19:24.183]  There's ex-cops that'll do it.
[01:19:25.003 --> 01:19:26.023]  They'd be happy to do it.
[01:19:26.083 --> 01:19:28.104]  Many of them would probably volunteer to do it.
[01:19:29.364 --> 01:19:34.946]  And unfortunately, you're just going to continue to see copycat events like this because the world has just gone to such a dark place, sadly.
[01:19:35.886 --> 01:19:37.226]  So we'll monitor that.
[01:19:37.266 --> 01:19:39.167]  But that's what the latest is there.
[01:19:39.627 --> 01:19:39.867]  All right.
[01:19:39.887 --> 01:19:42.228]  Drew Hernandez with me for another segment.
[01:19:44.048 --> 01:19:54.796]   And, you know, we've been talking about this issue because Again, I don't think anybody can, in their right mind, say that trans kids is a good thing.
[01:19:54.896 --> 01:20:00.438]  I don't think anybody in their right mind can say that drag queen stripper time for kids is a good thing.
[01:20:00.458 --> 01:20:03.619]  I mean, I think neutral observers see this stuff and they know it's bad.
[01:20:03.679 --> 01:20:10.141]  Twenty years ago, it wouldn't even have been up for debate, but now that they've brainwashed the youth, and maybe that's what it is, Drew.
[01:20:10.181 --> 01:20:19.747]   When you go to these events, like for example, Matt Walsh's event in Tennessee, where you had a bunch of the wild crazies show up, It does appear that it's mostly young people.
[01:20:20.307 --> 01:20:32.374]  And so I guess this is the result of decades of propaganda and programming into the youth that have made them buy into such disgusting, despicable behavior like trans kids surgery.
[01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:34.980]  Absolutely.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.701]  You've seen a total indoctrination.
[01:20:36.721 --> 01:20:39.561]  I mean, it's the same thing with Antifa and Black Lives Matter.
[01:20:40.341 --> 01:20:43.862]  These radicals, they get indoctrinated in these universities.
[01:20:44.042 --> 01:20:46.323]  That's why they're trying to push it even at a younger age.
[01:20:46.343 --> 01:20:55.805]  That's why they're trying to go K through 12, indoctrinating them with CRT and genderqueer theory and all this garbage and showing them pornography and little books and how to have gay sex.
[01:20:55.864 --> 01:20:59.783]   and they're trying to lower the bar because yeah, they could get them in the university,
[01:20:59.783 --> 01:21:03.465]   but you take a look at these people, Adolf Hitler knew this, the Nazis knew it,
[01:21:03.465 --> 01:21:07.623]   Mao obviously knew this, you target the youth, you win an entire generation,
[01:21:07.623 --> 01:21:09.824]   and I think these people know that, obviously they know that,
[01:21:09.824 --> 01:21:12.583]   and they're doing that with their twisted doctrines of demons,
[01:21:12.583 --> 01:21:17.984]   and you're seeing the fruit of their labor, of decades of indoctrination in universities
[01:21:17.984 --> 01:21:23.224]   and in schools and even in the mainstream media, and in the mainstream arts as well.
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:31.987]  You're seeing it all come to fruition when you see the 2020 riots, and you see these people championing literally the murder of babies inside and outside of the womb when they hit the street.
[01:21:32.488 --> 01:21:39.994]  When you see people screaming at me, telling me they love effing killing babies when I was in DC just, you know, right after the overturning of Roe v. Wade.
[01:21:40.314 --> 01:21:44.117]  But you also see it when they're out there doing the same thing to mutilate the genitals of children.
[01:21:44.677 --> 01:21:48.501]  The fruit of that demonic labor is coming to fruition.
[01:21:48.681 --> 01:21:52.624]  An entire generation has bought into this crap, and it's disgusting, and it's twisted.
[01:21:53.785 --> 01:22:00.231]  Yeah, I did the same thing at a beta rally, a Robert Francis O'Rourke rally here, and I said, I love abortion.
[01:22:00.271 --> 01:22:01.112]  I was on a microphone.
[01:22:01.132 --> 01:22:02.073]  I said, I love abortion.
[01:22:02.373 --> 01:22:05.516]  And these people with beta signs are like, yeah, yeah!
[01:22:05.536 --> 01:22:06.897]  And I'm like, yeah, let's kill the babies.
[01:22:06.917 --> 01:22:09.099]  They're like, yeah, kill the babies, yeah!
[01:22:09.139 --> 01:22:11.221]  It's like, oh my gosh.
[01:22:13.484 --> 01:22:13.965]  They love it.
[01:22:14.266 --> 01:22:14.787]  It's a cult.
[01:22:14.907 --> 01:22:15.769]  It's a death cult.
[01:22:15.829 --> 01:22:16.891]  They're Moloch worshippers.
[01:22:17.292 --> 01:22:18.595]  These people love death.
[01:22:19.156 --> 01:22:19.877]  That's what they love.
[01:22:19.897 --> 01:22:21.521]  They obsess over death.
[01:22:22.105 --> 01:22:22.345]  Right?
[01:22:22.685 --> 01:22:24.026]  They're just like Satan.
[01:22:24.087 --> 01:22:25.327]  They're filled with Satan.
[01:22:25.347 --> 01:22:27.609]  To steal, kill, and destroy.
[01:22:27.869 --> 01:22:31.352]  And that's why even, you know, I hate seeing that stuff, man.
[01:22:31.592 --> 01:22:35.835]  I hate seeing the school shootings, because you know that kind of stuff could be prevented.
[01:22:36.355 --> 01:22:40.518]  You know that if you had an armed person on that campus, it could have been prevented.
[01:22:40.859 --> 01:22:46.863]  And of course, the left is going to politicize and say, oh, we care so much about the kids, and this is why we need to take away guns.
[01:22:46.883 --> 01:22:49.345]  They immediately politicize it, just like they did with Ebola.
[01:22:49.445 --> 01:22:52.887]  And what are the odds that the 20-year-old shooter was on big pharmaceutical pills?
[01:22:52.907 --> 01:22:53.427]  What are the odds?
[01:22:54.488 --> 01:23:03.312]  The thing is, Owen, is they need further victimization so they could further control the population through fear.
[01:23:03.352 --> 01:23:05.833]  They do it through COVID, they do it, everything's a damn phobia.
[01:23:06.434 --> 01:23:10.876]  And obviously when it comes to the gun control thing, they need that to continue to keep going.
[01:23:11.256 --> 01:23:14.538]  Because if they don't have that, they don't have a narrative to control people through fear.
[01:23:15.199 --> 01:23:16.240]  And they don't care about kids!
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:17.901]  They don't give a damn about kids!
[01:23:18.162 --> 01:23:21.325]  Because if they did, we could put armed guards on the campuses.
[01:23:21.786 --> 01:23:24.869]  Oh no no, our kids, our babies shouldn't be living like that.
[01:23:24.889 --> 01:23:36.621]  Okay, if AOC and these left-leaning politicians could pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for armed security, for their lives to be protected, then why can't we have that for our babies in the United States?
[01:23:37.182 --> 01:23:37.863]  You wanna know why?
[01:23:38.063 --> 01:23:39.124]  Because they hate kids!
[01:23:39.564 --> 01:23:40.184]  They hate them!
[01:23:40.625 --> 01:23:42.326]  They wanna kill them before they're even born!
[01:23:42.606 --> 01:23:47.830]  Oh, the kid's gonna be poor, the kid's not gonna have a life, so we might as well just kill it, Stacey Abrams says!
[01:23:48.050 --> 01:23:50.773]  You can't afford to have a baby, so just kill the damn baby!
[01:23:51.193 --> 01:23:55.977]  Okay, the baby's born, oh, just warp its mind, cause it to believe- Chop off its weenie!
[01:23:56.737 --> 01:23:57.798]  Chop off its penis!
[01:23:58.118 --> 01:23:59.419]  Chop off its tits!
[01:23:59.519 --> 01:24:00.900]  Chemically castrate it!
[01:24:01.738 --> 01:24:02.258]  They hate them.
[01:24:02.538 --> 01:24:04.259]  They hate them across the board, Owen.
[01:24:04.439 --> 01:24:07.100]  They don't love children, and these people need to go.
[01:24:07.140 --> 01:24:08.140]  Listen, I'll say this.
[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:09.880]  We need to cancel the pedophiles.
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:11.421]  We need to cancel the groomers.
[01:24:11.621 --> 01:24:13.381]  We need to cancel the child mutilators.
[01:24:13.542 --> 01:24:20.804]  We need to cancel every single one of these people, because these people are a virus, they're toxic, and they're destroying our society.
[01:24:21.004 --> 01:24:26.405]  And I will not hold back on saying any of this stuff, because everyone that's watching this agrees with what I'm saying.
[01:24:26.565 --> 01:24:32.529]   We need to cancel every single one of these Parasitic individuals that are living in our society right now, and I'm not talking about violence.
[01:24:33.290 --> 01:24:37.994]  Wow, I mean, I was going to ask Drew about the upcoming midterms, but that's like a walk-off home run right there.
[01:24:38.034 --> 01:24:44.099]  I don't know if there's anything else to really be said, but I will just comment on one other thing you said, and then we'll let you go because you're spot on.
[01:24:44.660 --> 01:24:45.441]  I actually agree.
[01:24:45.461 --> 01:24:48.984]  I don't want to grow up in a country where we feel that we need armed guards at schools.
[01:24:49.364 --> 01:24:50.505]  I'm in complete agreement.
[01:24:50.545 --> 01:24:52.567]  That's not the society I want to live in, but guess what?
[01:24:53.047 --> 01:24:56.608]  If you want to stop a school shooting, let's think common sense measures.
[01:24:56.908 --> 01:25:04.510]  Have a trained marksman, an expert marksman on the scene that can neutralize a shooter, hopefully before he even gets a shot off.
[01:25:04.890 --> 01:25:07.891]  That's the common sense response to this, not disarming.
[01:25:08.191 --> 01:25:10.832]  Slaves aren't allowed to have weapons, so why should you?
[01:25:11.132 --> 01:25:12.632]  Disarm yourself like a good slave?
[01:25:13.053 --> 01:25:13.933]  I don't think so.
[01:25:14.493 --> 01:25:16.834]  Drew Hernandez, kick-ass job as always.
[01:25:16.874 --> 01:25:18.014]  Where can people follow your great work?
[01:25:19.178 --> 01:25:23.160]  You guys can follow me on Twitter, Drew H. Live, on Getter, Drew H. Live.
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:24.121]  Same on Truth Social.
[01:25:24.141 --> 01:25:33.125]  You can watch my show, Frontlines, powered by Turning Point USA, on Real America's Voice, every single night, Monday through Friday, at 7.30 p.m.
[01:25:33.165 --> 01:25:34.065]  Pacific Standard.
[01:25:34.106 --> 01:25:35.566]  That's 10.30 p.m.
[01:25:35.686 --> 01:25:36.527]  Eastern Standard.
[01:25:36.867 --> 01:25:37.667]  And we get into it.
[01:25:38.508 --> 01:25:39.308]  Absolutely awesome.
[01:25:39.328 --> 01:25:40.669]  Drew Hernandez, thanks for joining us today.
[01:25:41.852 --> 01:25:42.272]  Thank you, bro.
[01:25:42.333 --> 01:25:42.593]  Love you.
[01:25:43.053 --> 01:25:48.840]  Man, oh man, folks, I will tell you, I sleep easy at night knowing Drew Hernandez is out there.
[01:25:49.180 --> 01:25:55.267]  I sleep easy at night knowing there's great American patriots out there telling the truth with a giant following like Drew Hernandez.
[01:25:55.908 --> 01:25:57.249]  It makes me sleep easier at night.
[01:25:58.234 --> 01:26:02.117]  Obviously, InfoWars, they slated us for destruction years ago.
[01:26:02.177 --> 01:26:03.258]  We're still here operating.
[01:26:04.059 --> 01:26:09.803]  But just knowing the reinforcements are aligned behind us is truly a relief factor.
[01:26:09.903 --> 01:26:11.625]  But we don't plan on going anywhere.
[01:26:11.825 --> 01:26:13.106]  We don't plan on shutting down.
[01:26:13.586 --> 01:26:15.828]  I get asked all the time, you know, what's the situation?
[01:26:15.888 --> 01:26:16.789]  How much longer you got?
[01:26:16.829 --> 01:26:17.409]  What's going on?
[01:26:17.449 --> 01:26:19.671]  Folks, we're going to stay here as long as we can.
[01:26:19.691 --> 01:26:21.893]  We're going to keep this mothership in orbit as long as we can.
[01:26:22.353 --> 01:26:24.995]  We're very transparent about what's going on around here.
[01:26:25.095 --> 01:26:28.278]  We're even more transparent, considering everything has to come out in the court cases.
[01:26:28.558 --> 01:26:34.603]  They act like it doesn't come out, and they say, they didn't give us discovery, and then they, here's all the financials they showed us, so trillion dollars.
[01:26:34.623 --> 01:26:37.385]  Wait, you said we didn't give you financials, so how do you have the financials to get this?
[01:26:38.026 --> 01:26:41.688]  So obviously you understand it's all lies, but here's how it goes.
[01:26:42.574 --> 01:26:43.555]  This is the mothership.
[01:26:43.695 --> 01:26:44.316]  It's in orbit.
[01:26:44.376 --> 01:26:45.357]  We've got a gas tank.
[01:26:45.437 --> 01:26:46.558]  We just need to keep it filled.
[01:26:46.838 --> 01:26:47.518]  That's all it is.
[01:26:47.659 --> 01:26:50.281]  And when you shop at InfoWarsTore.com, that's what keeps it filled.
[01:26:50.601 --> 01:26:51.842]  Great ways to support us.
[01:26:52.343 --> 01:26:56.266]  If you're into taking supplements like me, I'm a supplement head.
[01:26:56.326 --> 01:26:58.588]  I take about 15, 20 different pills every day.
[01:26:58.708 --> 01:27:00.270]  All healthy, all organic supplements.
[01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:02.232]  Most of them from InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:27:02.512 --> 01:27:04.554]  The Vitamin Mineral Drink Fusion.
[01:27:04.873 --> 01:27:06.353]  is fantastic.
[01:27:06.353 --> 01:27:07.792]  I mix it with juice every morning.
[01:27:07.792 --> 01:27:11.514]   That's what I chase down my morning supplements with, is vitamin mineral fusion.
[01:27:11.514 --> 01:27:13.552]  Great flavor, healthy for you.
[01:27:13.552 --> 01:27:16.373]  I suggest having it for kids, too.
[01:27:16.373 --> 01:27:21.313]   My parents were pretty good about making sure I didn't drink too much soda and stuff,
[01:27:21.313 --> 01:27:23.072]  but I had sodas every once in a while.
[01:27:23.072 --> 01:27:24.474]  I like sodas.
[01:27:24.474 --> 01:27:27.273]  But I'm telling you, get your kids off the sodas.
[01:27:27.273 --> 01:27:29.212]  Don't even put the sodas in the fridge.
[01:27:29.212 --> 01:27:34.813]   Just have a cooler or have a pitcher of vitamin mineral fusion in the fridge.
[01:27:34.813 --> 01:27:37.213]  refrigerator and your kids are going to love it.
[01:27:37.024 --> 01:27:46.829]  And so instead of going and trying to get a toxic soda with the high fructose corn syrup in it, they'll go for a drink of Vitamin Mineral Fusion and they'll like it just as much and it'll be good for them.
[01:27:47.810 --> 01:27:49.951]  Or if you're like me, I just like starting out every day with it.
[01:27:50.291 --> 01:27:51.372]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[01:29:34.474 --> 01:29:34.494]  X3.
[01:29:36.547 --> 01:29:39.109]  All right, Merrick Garland has just gone live.
[01:29:39.129 --> 01:29:44.373]  This is their national security briefing ahead of the election.
[01:29:44.453 --> 01:29:48.596]  So let's see what kind of propaganda that pinhead is telling the American people.
[01:29:48.636 --> 01:29:49.197]  Let's go live.
[01:29:50.058 --> 01:29:55.982]  It attempts to stop protected First Amendment activities, protests here in the United States.
[01:29:56.002 --> 01:29:56.983]  Oh, like you guys censoring the internet?
[01:29:57.003 --> 01:29:59.565]  Which would have been embarrassing to the Chinese government.
[01:30:01.266 --> 01:30:14.662]   Separately, In the Eastern District of New York, the Justice Department charged seven individuals who were working on behalf of the PRC with engaging in a multi-year campaign of threats and harassment to force a U.S.
[01:30:14.742 --> 01:30:16.163]  resident to return to China.
[01:30:16.743 --> 01:30:20.365]  Last Thursday, we arrested two of those defendants.
[01:30:21.366 --> 01:30:28.050]  Those activities were part of the PRC's global extra-legal effort known as Operation Fox Hunt.
[01:30:29.093 --> 01:30:34.194]  His purpose is to locate and bring back to China alleged fugitives who have fled to foreign countries.
[01:30:35.054 --> 01:30:36.134]  Including the United States.
[01:30:36.154 --> 01:30:37.255]  He talks with no confidence.
[01:30:37.295 --> 01:30:38.755]  His voice is wavering like he's about to cry.
[01:30:38.775 --> 01:30:44.416]  The PRC has a history of targeting political dissidents and critics of the government who have sought relief and refuge.
[01:30:44.676 --> 01:30:45.216]  You think it's a woman?
[01:30:45.236 --> 01:30:45.996]  You think that's a trainee?
[01:30:47.017 --> 01:30:58.479]  The indictment alleges that the defendants working at the direction of the government of the PRC engaged in a campaign of harassment, threats, surveillance, and intimidation.
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:02.281]  Aimed at coercing the victim to return to China.
[01:31:03.021 --> 01:31:03.301]  Okay.
[01:31:03.621 --> 01:31:08.002]  We also allege that the defendants threatened and harassed... This is actually really big.
[01:31:08.122 --> 01:31:10.963]  I'm going to let him talk, but I'm going to tell you what's really going on here before the break.
[01:31:11.223 --> 01:31:12.704]  But this is actually bigger than I thought.
[01:31:12.744 --> 01:31:14.204]  This has nothing to do with the midterms.
[01:31:14.384 --> 01:31:15.004]  Let him continue.
[01:31:15.404 --> 01:31:21.326]  Travel from China to the United States to convey the PRC's threats to the victim's son.
[01:31:22.554 --> 01:31:29.779]  The defendants threatened the victim, saying that, quote, coming back and turning herself in is the only way out.
[01:31:30.719 --> 01:31:33.401]  They showed up at the home of the victim's son in New York.
[01:31:34.181 --> 01:31:44.048]  They filed frivolous lawsuits against the victim and his son and said it would be, quote, endless misery for the defendant and son to defend themselves.
[01:31:45.389 --> 01:31:51.833]  And they made clear that their harassment would not stop until the victim returned to China.
[01:31:53.536 --> 01:32:06.265]  As these cases demonstrate, the government of China sought to interfere with the rights and freedoms of individuals in the United States, and to undermine our judicial system that protects those rights.
[01:32:06.465 --> 01:32:13.710]  Okay, let me just do this upon that statement right there, and if he's still alive when we come back from this break, I'll pick it back up.
[01:32:13.770 --> 01:32:15.471]  Folks, this has nothing to do with the midterms.
[01:32:16.111 --> 01:32:23.496]   Do you really think that The Justice Department or the Biden administration cares about censorship of free speech?
[01:32:24.316 --> 01:32:25.657]  No, they engage in it themselves.
[01:32:25.697 --> 01:32:38.276]   In fact, Eric Schmidt is about to depose members of the Biden administration on how, as Mark Zuckerberg admitted, They went to social media companies to promote Democrat Party propaganda and censor Republicans.
[01:32:38.416 --> 01:32:39.657]  So that's all about to come out in court.
[01:32:40.157 --> 01:32:42.259]  So they don't care about, they don't care about free speech.
[01:32:42.279 --> 01:32:43.280]  This isn't a free speech thing.
[01:32:43.700 --> 01:32:57.731]  Do you really think they even care about what China does as far as censoring free speech or as far as, I mean folks, China's been caught, people have been caught trying to smuggle biological materials in and out of China.
[01:32:59.072 --> 01:33:09.034]   Scientists, they do deals with China where they make This is 100% an affront to China because they're aligning with Russia right now.
[01:33:09.094 --> 01:33:11.095]  That's what this is.
[01:33:10.914 --> 01:33:17.034]   There's been all kinds of problems with China and intellectual property theft here in America
[01:33:17.034 --> 01:33:18.234]  and hacking.
[01:33:18.234 --> 01:33:22.673]  So whatever he's saying this is about, it's not.
[01:33:22.673 --> 01:33:28.994]   This is 100% an affront to China because they're aligning with Russia right now.
[01:33:28.994 --> 01:33:30.394]  That's what this is.
[01:33:30.394 --> 01:33:32.434]  That's all this is.
[01:33:32.434 --> 01:33:33.875]  And it's actually pathetic.
[01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:37.343]  It'd be one thing if our government actually cared about standing up to the Chinese Communists.
[01:33:37.463 --> 01:33:38.064]  You know they don't.
[01:33:39.005 --> 01:33:42.788]  So they send Merrick Garland a chicken-necked weasel.
[01:33:44.002 --> 01:33:46.424]  Who can't even speak without his voice wavering.
[01:33:47.124 --> 01:33:57.771]  They send Merrick Garland a chicken-necked weasel and this woman up there to try to intimidate China and act like they're going to do something about Chinese corruption politically here in America.
[01:33:58.352 --> 01:34:02.795]  Folks, all this is is an affront to China because they're siding with Russia on the Ukraine situation.
[01:34:02.875 --> 01:34:03.555]  That's all this is.
[01:34:03.856 --> 01:34:04.636]  That's all this is.
[01:34:05.196 --> 01:34:06.678]  This is saber-rattling with China.
[01:34:07.498 --> 01:34:12.460]  This is acting like they're going to do something about China, acting like they're going to take Chinese corruption seriously.
[01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:13.001]  They're not.
[01:34:13.421 --> 01:34:16.282]  No one's going to take Merrick Garland seriously.
[01:34:16.602 --> 01:34:18.303]  No one's going to take this woman seriously.
[01:34:19.144 --> 01:34:20.384]  Is that Newland up there now?
[01:34:20.804 --> 01:34:22.605]  China does not care what you think.
[01:34:22.665 --> 01:34:25.347]  This is the Democrat Party attempt to intimidate China.
[01:34:25.387 --> 01:34:27.247]  Wow, what a pathetic display.
[01:34:27.908 --> 01:34:30.089]  Alright, we're trying to figure out who this woman speaking is.
[01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:32.711]  It's not Victoria Nuland.
[01:34:34.031 --> 01:34:34.992]  But let's go back.
[01:34:35.032 --> 01:34:36.453]  This is the Democrat Party.
[01:34:36.573 --> 01:34:50.520]  This is the American regime's attempt to intimidate China with Merrick Garland saying, oh, we're going to take the Chinese people seriously now when they censor and they threaten people.
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:51.841]  Oh, give me a break.
[01:34:52.281 --> 01:34:57.564]  This is them saber rattling saying, China, you better not side with Russia in the Ukrainian war.
[01:34:58.025 --> 01:34:58.885]  Unbelievable stuff.
[01:34:58.925 --> 01:35:00.326]  Let's go back to this goon squad.
[01:35:01.291 --> 01:35:02.052]  Lisa Monaco, Deputy Director.
[01:35:01.872 --> 01:35:07.872]   and others through a variety of means, including with all expense paid trips to China.
[01:35:07.872 --> 01:35:10.872]  Lisa Monaco, Deputy Director. Yeah, she scares China.
[01:35:10.872 --> 01:35:16.872]   The plots failed because the men and women of the Department of Justice defended our institutions
[01:35:16.872 --> 01:35:21.872]   and thwarted the persistent threat posed by agents of the PRC.
[01:35:21.872 --> 01:35:26.872]   I want to thank the agents, analysts, and prosecutors in all of these cases
[01:35:26.872 --> 01:35:31.872]  for their tireless work on behalf of the American people.
[01:35:32.418 --> 01:35:34.800]  And now I'll turn the podium over to FBI Director Wray.
[01:35:35.061 --> 01:35:35.681]  Oh, here we go.
[01:35:35.721 --> 01:35:37.283]  Now Wray's going to try to intimidate China.
[01:35:37.543 --> 01:35:39.465]  China's been involved in our affairs for years.
[01:35:39.685 --> 01:35:41.367]  Half these people are paid off by China.
[01:35:41.527 --> 01:35:41.907]  Thank you.
[01:35:42.648 --> 01:35:53.739]  First, let me begin by pointing out that 10 of the 13 charged individuals we're discussing today are Chinese intelligence officers and Chinese government officials.
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:36:00.564]  They're charged in three different cases that might seem at first glance to be about unrelated issues.
[01:36:00.644 --> 01:36:13.712]  However, and this is something that I've been talking about for years now, each of these cases lays bare the Chinese government's flagrant violation of international laws as they work to project their authoritarian view around the world.
[01:36:13.732 --> 01:36:15.093]  This has been going on for years.
[01:36:15.393 --> 01:36:15.713]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:36:15.793 --> 01:36:18.734]  Are they going to go after Hunter Biden for his deals with the Chinese?
[01:36:18.834 --> 01:36:22.236]  Are they going to go after Joe and Hunter Biden because of their Chinese deals?
[01:36:22.496 --> 01:36:23.016]  No.
[01:36:23.156 --> 01:36:25.537]  This is all saber-rattling, folks.
[01:36:25.657 --> 01:36:31.219]  ...established democratic norms and the rule of law as they work to undermine U.S.
[01:36:31.279 --> 01:36:34.961]  economic security and fundamental human rights... Been doing that for decades.
[01:36:34.981 --> 01:36:36.722]  ...including those of Americans.
[01:36:36.862 --> 01:36:37.782]  Been doing that for decades.
[01:36:37.802 --> 01:36:41.904]  We also see a coordinated effort... Why this press conference today, I'll tell you.
[01:36:42.924 --> 01:36:50.126]  Cheat and steal their way into unfairly dominating entire technology sectors, putting competing U.S.
[01:36:50.166 --> 01:36:51.887]  companies out of business.
[01:36:52.067 --> 01:36:53.427]  This is all old news!
[01:36:53.467 --> 01:36:54.447]  This is literally decades old news!
[01:36:54.467 --> 01:36:59.349]  As I pointed out before, their economic assault and their rights violations are part of the same problem.
[01:36:59.369 --> 01:37:00.649]  They both fall under the rule of law.
[01:37:00.669 --> 01:37:01.830]  Alright, alright, pull it down.
[01:37:01.870 --> 01:37:02.810]  This is hilarious.
[01:37:02.850 --> 01:37:04.630]  I mean, honestly, this is just comical stuff.
[01:37:05.051 --> 01:37:09.432]  So now, InfoWars is next decade's news today on the Department of Justice.
[01:37:11.097 --> 01:37:13.038]  Everything they're talking about is old news, folks.
[01:37:13.598 --> 01:37:14.118]  You understand?
[01:37:14.258 --> 01:37:22.321]  Look, I'm sorry, this is just so hilarious that this is what this event ended up being.
[01:37:22.981 --> 01:37:29.903]  Folks, again, I'm going to tell you, this is actually really bad news for the Biden administration, quite frankly, and, well, bad news for the country.
[01:37:30.604 --> 01:37:33.185]  But specifically, this is bad news for the Biden administration.
[01:37:33.905 --> 01:37:39.947]  They're not getting cooperation out of China on the Russia-Ukraine situation, and China is actually helping Russia.
[01:37:41.032 --> 01:37:44.021]  And so this is the Biden administration trying to...
[01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:47.481]  I don't even know really.
[01:37:47.561 --> 01:37:50.022]  I guess think that this is going to intimidate China?
[01:37:50.082 --> 01:37:54.364]  Like China's going to be threatened by the Biden family that they have blackmail on?
[01:37:54.624 --> 01:37:55.525]  Are you kidding me?
[01:37:55.925 --> 01:38:00.528]  Like Merrick Garland and Christopher Wray are going to stand up to China?
[01:38:00.548 --> 01:38:04.870]  And they're going to sit here and be like, we care about the censorship of free speech in China.
[01:38:04.910 --> 01:38:06.831]  We care about the intellectual property theft.
[01:38:06.851 --> 01:38:07.791]  We care about this stuff.
[01:38:08.192 --> 01:38:09.352]  This is all old news.
[01:38:09.392 --> 01:38:10.553]  Why are they bringing it up today?
[01:38:10.733 --> 01:38:16.816]   They're bringing it up today Because China is not cooperating with them on the situation in Ukraine.
[01:38:17.116 --> 01:38:18.937]  That's what this is all about.
[01:38:19.637 --> 01:38:21.758]  That's what this is all about right here.
[01:38:21.919 --> 01:38:23.699]  Everything they're telling you they've known for years.
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:25.960]  Everything they're telling you is decades old news.
[01:38:26.581 --> 01:38:31.123]  This is 100% because China is siding with Russia in the Ukrainian war.
[01:38:31.183 --> 01:38:36.025]  And so they're going to front to China like, we're going to do something about your corruption.
[01:38:36.286 --> 01:38:37.846]  We know you've got spies here.
[01:38:38.106 --> 01:38:40.007]  We know you've got intelligence chiefs here.
[01:38:40.047 --> 01:38:41.188]  We're going to do something about it.
[01:38:41.448 --> 01:38:47.150]  They're not going to do jack crap and China knows it because China owns the Bidens.
[01:38:47.430 --> 01:38:54.292]  I mean, we've got phone calls, emails, texts about Hunter Biden bragging about how he cuts deals with the richest Chinese people in the world.
[01:38:54.633 --> 01:38:59.454]  So this is ridiculous stuff coming out of the Biden administration.
[01:38:59.774 --> 01:39:03.956]  And they assume that people are so stupid, they're not going to see what's actually going on here.
[01:39:04.256 --> 01:39:06.997]  But that's why you're tuned in InfoWars, because we'll tell it like it is.
[01:39:07.297 --> 01:39:09.858]  So whatever he's talking about, forget about it.
[01:39:10.782 --> 01:39:22.232]  This is all the Biden administration fronting to China because they're supporting Russia in the situation with Ukraine and now becoming an ally of Russia in the larger geopolitical picture.
[01:39:22.272 --> 01:39:23.574]  But let's go back at least.
[01:39:23.934 --> 01:39:25.856]  I'll finish off the segment with a little bit more here.
[01:39:26.676 --> 01:39:29.819]  But then I'm going to put this propaganda away and we'll move on.
[01:39:29.879 --> 01:39:30.380]  But here we go.
[01:39:31.641 --> 01:39:34.463]  When have you ever heard a press conference about China?
[01:39:34.523 --> 01:39:34.663]  When?
[01:39:34.703 --> 01:39:34.803]  Ever?
[01:39:34.863 --> 01:39:35.323]  Tell me.
[01:39:35.182 --> 01:39:41.302]   case today. Yet another case where the Chinese government officials and co-conspirators mercilessly
[01:39:41.302 --> 01:39:46.542]   harassed a naturalized US citizen. When have you ever heard a press conference about China?
[01:39:46.542 --> 01:39:50.862]  When? Ever. Against his will. Tell me, maybe Donald Trump.
[01:39:50.862 --> 01:39:54.542]   They accused the victim in this case of embezzling money, but two of the subjects who
[01:39:54.542 --> 01:40:02.092]   targeted him, two of the defendants charged today, are themselves actually involved in a scheme to launder
[01:40:02.092 --> 01:40:03.622]  millions of dollars.
[01:40:04.195 --> 01:40:12.777]  And as if that weren't enough evidence that the real purpose of their operation was political, they gave their victim a deadline to return by.
[01:40:13.898 --> 01:40:17.139]  The 20th CCP Congress earlier this month.
[01:40:18.559 --> 01:40:22.320]  They're focused on repression, not law enforcement.
[01:40:23.677 --> 01:40:27.020]  But our partners also see the CCP's broader hypocrisy.
[01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:42.334]  The fact that while the CCP claims to stand for sovereignty and non-interference in other states' affairs, what the Chinese government actually does is interfere with sovereign governments around the world whenever doing so suits Beijing.
[01:40:42.674 --> 01:40:43.895]  And what about what we do in Ukraine?
[01:40:43.915 --> 01:40:46.697]  Here, interfering with our independent judiciary.
[01:40:47.833 --> 01:40:57.106]  Violating both our sovereignty and the norms of police conduct to run lawless intimidation campaigns here in our backyard.
[01:40:57.186 --> 01:40:58.969]  Oh, China funds our politics?
[01:40:58.989 --> 01:40:59.730]  Wow.
[01:40:59.770 --> 01:41:01.673]  Who could have known?
[01:41:01.733 --> 01:41:03.675]  Thank God Chris Wray is telling you this now.
[01:41:05.503 --> 01:41:09.587]  The FBI is going to continue to say what we mean and mean what we say.
[01:41:09.607 --> 01:41:15.594]  So our partners both here and abroad, many of whom tell us they're battling Chinese aggression themselves.
[01:41:15.934 --> 01:41:18.377]  And probably been begging you for help for years, you've been ignoring them.
[01:41:18.397 --> 01:41:21.941]  Against the Chinese government and countless other dangers.
[01:41:23.717 --> 01:41:31.429]  Finally, let me urge any person or company being targeted or approached by the Chinese government to come to the FBI for help.
[01:41:31.549 --> 01:41:37.778]  No American citizen, resident, company, or university should battle this threat alone.
[01:41:38.837 --> 01:41:39.658]  And you don't have to.
[01:41:39.878 --> 01:41:45.065]  You can report information through your local FBI field office or online at FBI.gov.
[01:41:45.105 --> 01:41:48.950]  The Biden administration is coming after the Chinese communists now.
[01:41:48.990 --> 01:41:51.593]  They're coming after the Chinese spies, I'm sure of it.
[01:41:52.134 --> 01:41:55.258]  Not the Chinese people, and certainly not Chinese Americans.
[01:41:56.544 --> 01:42:06.652]  I want to congratulate all the FBI special agents, intelligence analysts, and professional staff who worked on these cases, as well as our partners at CBP and the IRS.
[01:42:06.872 --> 01:42:08.093]  All right, so that's fine.
[01:42:08.193 --> 01:42:08.734]  So there you go.
[01:42:08.754 --> 01:42:09.194]  Pull it down.
[01:42:09.455 --> 01:42:09.935]  Oh, yes.
[01:42:10.075 --> 01:42:11.856]  Oh, the Chinese communists are the worst.
[01:42:12.057 --> 01:42:15.519]  Oh, yeah, because you don't do that same thing here to Americans.
[01:42:15.559 --> 01:42:17.641]  You don't censor Americans' free speech.
[01:42:17.721 --> 01:42:17.981]  Oh, wait.
[01:42:18.001 --> 01:42:18.482]  Yeah, you do.
[01:42:18.542 --> 01:42:19.443]  Right out of the White House.
[01:42:20.964 --> 01:42:22.265]  Folks, this is just embarrassing.
[01:42:22.325 --> 01:42:24.467]  Honestly, it's so low IQ at this point.
[01:42:26.846 --> 01:42:33.094]  I mean, you can find dozens if not hundreds of stories about Chinese theft of intellectual property in America.
[01:42:33.155 --> 01:42:34.256]  They've never had a press conference.
[01:42:35.017 --> 01:42:37.540]  I mean, look, here's the Washington Post in March.
[01:42:38.871 --> 01:42:40.213]  This is the Washington Post in March.
[01:42:40.693 --> 01:42:44.798]  Inside Hunter Biden's multi-million dollar deals with the Chinese energy company.
[01:42:45.378 --> 01:42:52.426]  Do you really think any of these people are going to do a damn thing about China and Chinese interference in this country?
[01:42:53.247 --> 01:42:53.507]  No.
[01:42:53.668 --> 01:42:54.689]  I mean, they might.
[01:42:54.709 --> 01:42:55.970]  They'll pull a few hairs, maybe.
[01:42:56.691 --> 01:42:57.852]  Maybe they'll trim a few hedges.
[01:42:59.073 --> 01:43:00.754]  The Bidens are owned by China.
[01:43:01.394 --> 01:43:03.675]  Half the Democrat Party's probably owned by China.
[01:43:04.015 --> 01:43:06.156]  Hell, probably Republican leadership's owned by China, too.
[01:43:06.196 --> 01:43:07.337]  Just look at Mitch McConnell's wife.
[01:43:08.017 --> 01:43:09.237]  Even Donald Trump called that out.
[01:43:10.098 --> 01:43:14.740]  So, all this stuff that they're talking about, I'm not denying it's real.
[01:43:15.340 --> 01:43:18.962]  I'm not denying the stories and the stuff the FBI is doing against Chinese communists is real.
[01:43:19.282 --> 01:43:20.203]  I'm sure it is real.
[01:43:20.823 --> 01:43:22.564]  But it's all old news.
[01:43:22.624 --> 01:43:23.745]  It's been going on for years.
[01:43:23.805 --> 01:43:24.965]  It's been going on for decades.
[01:43:24.985 --> 01:43:26.186]  They've never had a press conference.
[01:43:26.206 --> 01:43:27.327]  They've never given a damn.
[01:43:27.567 --> 01:43:29.488]  They've never cared about warning the American people.
[01:43:29.848 --> 01:43:33.930]  Fauci funds biological weapons labs research in Chinese military labs.
[01:43:34.290 --> 01:43:38.473]  The Bidens do multi-million dollar deals with the Chinese communists.
[01:43:38.833 --> 01:43:40.254]  So many others in DC do.
[01:43:40.914 --> 01:43:42.555]  So, I mean, this is just a joke.
[01:43:43.581 --> 01:43:44.462]  This is just a joke.
[01:43:44.522 --> 01:43:45.683]  Understand what this is really about.
[01:43:46.924 --> 01:43:58.613]  This is the Biden administration upset that China is supporting Russia in the war in Ukraine and that China is now becoming an ally with Russia in the larger geopolitical picture.
[01:43:58.893 --> 01:44:00.054]  That's all this was about.
[01:44:00.534 --> 01:44:02.236]  So the stuff in that was probably real.
[01:44:02.276 --> 01:44:05.338]  There are spies here, intellectual property theft, censorship.
[01:44:05.558 --> 01:44:06.159]  That's all real.
[01:44:06.179 --> 01:44:07.059]  The Chinese do all that.
[01:44:07.119 --> 01:44:07.780]  No doubt about it.
[01:44:07.860 --> 01:44:08.981]  They've known about it for years.
[01:44:09.401 --> 01:44:17.007]  They're only making it a public thing today as an intimidation factor against the Chinese for siding with Russia in Ukraine.
[01:44:19.008 --> 01:44:20.349]  Folks, we've got a big problem.
[01:44:21.450 --> 01:44:26.734]  And that's... The biggest criminals, perhaps in the world, reside in Washington, D.C.
[01:44:26.754 --> 01:44:28.175]  They're called American politicians.
[01:44:29.155 --> 01:44:30.216]  And the whole world knows it.
[01:44:31.817 --> 01:44:33.138]  And Donald Trump wasn't one of them.
[01:44:34.099 --> 01:44:35.680]  That's why they had to get Trump out of office.
[01:44:36.921 --> 01:44:38.142]  That's why they had to destroy Trump.
[01:44:39.622 --> 01:44:46.084]  And that's why we're in the position we're in today with so much going wrong in this country.
[01:44:46.424 --> 01:44:49.465]  And this just came from the Washington Post.
[01:44:50.225 --> 01:44:53.246]  Liberals urge Biden to rethink Ukraine strategy.
[01:44:57.367 --> 01:44:59.048]  You guys are so stupid.
[01:44:59.668 --> 01:45:03.309]  You don't realize that they don't give a damn what you think.
[01:45:03.429 --> 01:45:06.670]  This is a much bigger agenda and a money laundering operation.
[01:45:07.688 --> 01:45:16.230]  The UN said $6 billion could solve world hunger when they wanted to make Elon Musk look bad, but Biden's give $100 billion to Ukraine and nobody talks about world hunger then.
[01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:17.910]  Amazing stuff.
[01:45:17.930 --> 01:45:22.371]  So yeah, yeah, the Ukraine strategy should have been rethought a long time ago.
[01:45:22.891 --> 01:45:26.032]  It was already decided they would fight Russia.
[01:45:26.152 --> 01:45:28.712]  It was already decided they'd send troops to the front lines.
[01:45:28.772 --> 01:45:31.313]  It was already decided that they'll have a nuclear confrontation.
[01:45:31.353 --> 01:45:33.113]  They already decided all of it.
[01:45:33.413 --> 01:45:34.454]  There's no rethinking.
[01:45:34.694 --> 01:45:36.574]  It's already been thought out and planned out.
[01:45:38.578 --> 01:45:39.378]  That's cute though.
[01:45:40.299 --> 01:45:50.005]  That's cute that you think the military-industrial complex and the heads of the Democrat and Republican Party want to listen to you when it comes to peace and not war.
[01:45:50.105 --> 01:45:50.845]  That's hilarious.
[01:45:50.925 --> 01:45:51.646]  That's really cute.
[01:45:51.706 --> 01:45:52.766]  You must be really naive.
[01:45:53.987 --> 01:45:57.369]  Now I want to get into some vaccine issues before we're joined by Savannah Hernandez.
[01:45:57.389 --> 01:46:02.112]  But first, remember they told you that vaccine would be safe and effective and wouldn't?
[01:46:03.709 --> 01:46:06.891]  And you wouldn't get sick, and you wouldn't transmit the disease if you had it.
[01:46:06.932 --> 01:46:07.412]  Remember that?
[01:46:07.472 --> 01:46:09.233]  Well, in case you don't, here's a little reminder.
[01:46:10.614 --> 01:46:14.597]  When people are vaccinated, they can feel safe that they are not going to get infected.
[01:46:18.961 --> 01:46:19.541]  You're okay.
[01:46:19.821 --> 01:46:22.944]  You're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations.
[01:46:26.087 --> 01:46:39.193]  Our data from the CDC today suggests that vaccinated people do not carry the virus, don't get sick, and that it's not just in the clinical trials, but it's also in real-world data.
[01:46:42.051 --> 01:46:50.875]  If you get vaccinated, that vaccine will basically prevent you from getting sick with COVID, it will prevent you from having to go to the hospital with COVID symptoms, it will prevent you from dying from COVID.
[01:46:50.955 --> 01:46:51.655]  Great, good for you.
[01:46:52.196 --> 01:46:55.117]  What this means is that we can get there with vaccines.
[01:46:55.797 --> 01:46:58.999]  Instead of the virus being able to hop from person to person to person.
[01:47:00.404 --> 01:47:03.866]  Potentially mutating and becoming more virulent and drug-resistant along the way.
[01:47:03.886 --> 01:47:11.150]  Now we know that the vaccines work well enough that the virus stops with every vaccinated person.
[01:47:11.530 --> 01:47:14.492]  A vaccinated person gets exposed to the virus.
[01:47:16.293 --> 01:47:18.074]  The virus does not infect them.
[01:47:18.214 --> 01:47:21.255]  The virus cannot then use that person to go anywhere else.
[01:47:23.397 --> 01:47:26.879]  It cannot use a vaccinated person as a host to go get more people.
[01:47:26.919 --> 01:47:29.120]  She says the propaganda was so much confidence.
[01:47:30.512 --> 01:47:39.334]  Everyone who takes the vaccine is not just protecting themselves but reducing their transmission to other people and allowing society to get back to normal.
[01:47:41.114 --> 01:47:42.854]  We need the humans to just die.
[01:47:42.894 --> 01:47:49.835]  There is no variant that we have identified that escapes the protection of our vaccine.
[01:47:49.654 --> 01:47:56.654]   transmission of the disease. There is no variant that we have identified that escapes the protection of our vaccine.
[01:47:56.654 --> 01:47:58.654]  (laughter)
[01:47:58.654 --> 01:48:00.654]  (applause)
[01:48:00.654 --> 01:48:05.654]   Oops. There's all your vaccine pushers lying to you about that vaccine.
[01:48:06.010 --> 01:48:06.750]  Can I sue them?
[01:48:06.871 --> 01:48:10.212]  I want to sue them for $39 quadrillion.
[01:48:11.913 --> 01:48:14.674]  I want to sue them for $39 quadrillion.
[01:48:16.775 --> 01:48:17.335]  I mean, why not?
[01:48:17.395 --> 01:48:27.780]  I mean, if they can sue Infowars for $2.75 trillion, why can't I sue them for quadrillions after lying to us about the vaccine that impacted hundreds of millions, if not billions of people?
[01:48:28.891 --> 01:48:32.232]  I think those liars owe the planet quadrillions of dollars.
[01:48:34.912 --> 01:48:35.193]  U.S.
[01:48:35.233 --> 01:48:40.674]  still denies entry to unvaccinated legal travelers, but not illegal aliens walking across the open border.
[01:48:41.514 --> 01:48:43.955]  You know, it's a joke that goes around, but there's truth to it.
[01:48:44.995 --> 01:48:49.556]  If you're not vaccinated and you want to travel to America, just travel to Mexico and then walk across the border.
[01:48:50.176 --> 01:48:53.497]  And you'll get a free ride and maybe some nice cash for your vacation as well.
[01:48:55.402 --> 01:48:57.324]  Of course, that's just a complete joke.
[01:48:57.344 --> 01:48:58.526]  But see, that's what it's all about.
[01:48:58.746 --> 01:48:59.187]  Oh, see?
[01:48:59.707 --> 01:49:01.089]  The law-abiding citizens.
[01:49:01.269 --> 01:49:03.231]  Oh, yes, get that vaccine.
[01:49:03.272 --> 01:49:04.733]  Now you can abide by the law.
[01:49:05.074 --> 01:49:07.917]  But the people that don't abide by the law, they just get to do whatever they want.
[01:49:08.097 --> 01:49:09.058]  Oh, you're an illegal immigrant?
[01:49:09.119 --> 01:49:10.160]  Oh, you didn't take the vaccine?
[01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:11.261]  Oh, everything's good for you.
[01:49:12.042 --> 01:49:14.225]  And that same logic applies with the gun debate.
[01:49:16.074 --> 01:49:19.017]  Oh, criminals are just going to turn their guns in when they make them illegal.
[01:49:19.057 --> 01:49:19.937]  Come on, man.
[01:49:20.538 --> 01:49:23.340]  All we got to do is make guns illegal and criminals are going to turn their guns in.
[01:49:23.380 --> 01:49:26.302]  Kind of like, all we have to do is make murder illegal and nobody will murder anymore.
[01:49:26.383 --> 01:49:27.483]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[01:49:29.445 --> 01:49:32.487]  So, oh, you, the law-abiding citizen, you disarm yourself.
[01:49:32.868 --> 01:49:36.591]  You, the law-abiding citizen, you turn over your gun and now you become the victim.
[01:49:37.031 --> 01:49:38.012]  Now you become the slave.
[01:49:39.053 --> 01:49:42.896]  But, oh, the criminal that doesn't turn his gun in, now he's got the upper hand.
[01:49:43.576 --> 01:49:44.157]  See how that works?
[01:49:45.749 --> 01:49:48.371]  What did Jill Biden mean?
[01:49:48.511 --> 01:49:49.471]  Fake Dr. Jill.
[01:49:50.032 --> 01:49:57.016]  What did she mean when she predicted a wave of cancer diagnoses after COVID-19?
[01:49:57.056 --> 01:49:58.517]  Does she know something we don't know?
[01:49:59.177 --> 01:50:02.379]  Did she mean COVID-19 or the COVID-19 vaccine?
[01:50:02.399 --> 01:50:08.003]  Because we are seeing a spike in brain cancers, specifically since the COVID-19 vaccine.
[01:50:08.363 --> 01:50:11.205]  Neurological problems, brain problems, one of the main side effects.
[01:50:11.285 --> 01:50:12.265]  What does she know?
[01:50:13.486 --> 01:50:14.407]  What does she know?
[01:50:16.687 --> 01:50:17.768]  Gateway Pointed Headline.
[01:50:18.889 --> 01:50:20.590]  COVID-19 was made in a lab.
[01:50:20.690 --> 01:50:23.553]  Without a reckoning, even more deadly pandemics are in our future.
[01:50:23.733 --> 01:50:24.193]  That's right!
[01:50:24.994 --> 01:50:32.520]  Because we're not putting an end to this deadly research by mad scientists like Anthony Fauci, they're gonna make another bioweapon in a lab and it's gonna escape.
[01:50:32.921 --> 01:50:34.882]  They already brag about how they have one in Boston.
[01:50:35.902 --> 01:50:39.405]  That kills 80% of the mice that get infected with it.
[01:50:39.425 --> 01:50:45.390]  And so they say, oh look, this COVID gain-of-function research we did in Boston, which is totally illegal in the U.S.
[01:50:45.451 --> 01:50:47.112]  I don't know how it hasn't been raided and shut down.
[01:50:47.592 --> 01:50:49.434]  Oh look, it kills 80% of humans.
[01:50:49.534 --> 01:50:50.275]  Aren't we great?
[01:50:51.316 --> 01:50:52.277]  Aren't we the best?
[01:50:53.237 --> 01:50:54.018]  Look at how great we are.
[01:50:54.058 --> 01:50:56.000]  We made a virus that'll kill 80% of you.
[01:50:57.001 --> 01:50:57.902]  Give us a peace prize.
[01:50:59.423 --> 01:51:03.004]  CDC votes to add COVID-19 vaccines to childhood immunization schedules.
[01:51:03.044 --> 01:51:04.524]  So it doesn't matter that it doesn't work.
[01:51:04.544 --> 01:51:08.705]  It doesn't matter all the side effects and the heart attacks and the myocarditis and the cancers.
[01:51:08.866 --> 01:51:10.806]  Give that thing to your kids.
[01:51:11.346 --> 01:51:12.647]  Be a good slave.
[01:51:12.987 --> 01:51:17.588]  Disarm yourself and make them take the forced medical procedures.
[01:51:18.851 --> 01:51:26.259]  And of course, what happened immediately upon the CDC unanimously voting to add COVID-19 vaccines to the childhood schedule?
[01:51:26.659 --> 01:51:28.101]  Pfizer hikes U.S.
[01:51:28.121 --> 01:51:31.204]  COVID vaccine price to $130 per dose.
[01:51:31.505 --> 01:51:32.806]  Isn't that just amazing?
[01:51:32.826 --> 01:51:34.968]  Pfizer loves you so much.
[01:51:36.570 --> 01:51:38.572]  Oh, and I'm sure there's no collusion.
[01:51:39.013 --> 01:51:55.976]   I will bet I would bet a lot of money that at least one of the 15 people that voted unanimously to make the COVID-19 vaccine on the childhood immunization schedule, I would bet at least one of them, I'd bet a lot, I'd bet it all, that at least one of them ends up working for Pfizer.
[01:51:56.377 --> 01:51:58.400]  You don't think this whole thing was planned out, folks?
[01:51:59.861 --> 01:52:00.521]  Give me a break.
[01:52:00.601 --> 01:52:02.242]  Pfizer knew they were going to get the votes.
[01:52:02.762 --> 01:52:10.406]  They've got these CDC officials, bureaucrats in their back pocket, and they had the price hike ready to go.
[01:52:10.646 --> 01:52:16.169]  But they admit scientists and doctors divided over whether myocarditis concerns should influence vaccine recommendations.
[01:52:16.549 --> 01:52:21.371]  Yeah, that vaccine might give your 15-year-old a heart attack, and they wouldn't even get COVID.
[01:52:21.391 --> 01:52:22.292]  They wouldn't even know if they did.
[01:52:22.432 --> 01:52:22.992]  But you know what?
[01:52:23.052 --> 01:52:24.833]  It's probably worth it to give him that heart attack anyway.
[01:52:25.674 --> 01:52:28.135]  Savannah Hernandez joins us now.
[01:52:29.464 --> 01:52:33.327]  And she has been traveling everywhere dealing with the craziness.
[01:52:33.367 --> 01:52:36.030]  She was in Portland following around some drug addicts.
[01:52:36.070 --> 01:52:37.531]  She had some incredible footage there.
[01:52:37.651 --> 01:52:41.334]  She was then also in Tennessee at the Matt Walsh event with all the crazies.
[01:52:41.994 --> 01:52:45.657]  But let's first start about what you witnessed in Portland.
[01:52:45.678 --> 01:52:48.079]  I think some of the footage might even be on Bandot video.
[01:52:48.099 --> 01:52:49.381]  I'm not sure where all of it is.
[01:52:49.461 --> 01:52:50.842]  The crew said they had some of the footage.
[01:52:52.983 --> 01:53:07.110]  It wasn't too hard for you to go to Portland and immediately get into the drug addict circle and get exclusive footage of people overdosing right there on the streets, right in front of the public, and then they get robbed.
[01:53:07.550 --> 01:53:09.151]  Some woman comes and robs the guy.
[01:53:09.211 --> 01:53:11.492]  Is that what we're seeing here in this video, Savannah Hernandez?
[01:53:13.044 --> 01:53:19.947]  So this is a homeless woman who said that she was trying to help him by looking through his pockets for which drugs he was actually on.
[01:53:20.547 --> 01:53:25.549]  But then the police officer who rolled up apparently was familiar with this woman and chased her away.
[01:53:25.890 --> 01:53:29.751]  So yes, this was within two hours of me being in downtown Portland.
[01:53:29.831 --> 01:53:38.575]  And before I start this entire story as well of what I experienced there, I want to remind the viewers that Joe Biden had previously or had visited Portland a couple days before.
[01:53:38.835 --> 01:53:40.616]  So this was the city cleaned up.
[01:53:41.431 --> 01:53:47.096]  So, within two hours of being in downtown Portland, I witnessed an attempted theft of a local corner store.
[01:53:47.417 --> 01:53:51.440]  I went and I interviewed the business owner immediately and said, hey, is this something that happens often?
[01:53:51.480 --> 01:53:54.043]  To which she responded, yes, a couple times a day.
[01:53:54.403 --> 01:54:00.227]   On top of that, we We're walking down the street and this was in a very nice area across from a bank.
[01:54:00.427 --> 01:54:02.368]  This man is overdosing at 4 p.m.
[01:54:02.408 --> 01:54:05.430]  in broad daylight as a homeless woman is pickpocketing him.
[01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:07.451]  The police roll up and they do what they can.
[01:54:08.091 --> 01:54:15.695]  I spoke to an officer on the scene who said that during the summer when this is typically worse, they'll have four to five overdoses per day.
[01:54:15.835 --> 01:54:20.298]  One time it was so bad that they had a couple of overdoses within a one block radius.
[01:54:20.698 --> 01:54:28.787]  And this is a direct response of Measure 110, which was passed back in 2020, which decriminalized hard drugs throughout the entire state of Oregon.
[01:54:29.107 --> 01:54:36.555]  So the issue of overdosing, crimes, drugs, homelessness has just risen exponentially since then, back in 2021.
[01:54:38.096 --> 01:54:45.262]  Overdose deaths rose 33% as a direct result of this measure and the streets of Portland just truly horrifying.
[01:54:45.303 --> 01:54:53.069]  You guys are seeing this footage on screen here of this man smoking a mix of Percocets and Fentanyl, which he says he does every single day.
[01:54:53.329 --> 01:54:54.170]  I actually spoke to him.
[01:54:54.210 --> 01:54:59.014]   He said that he Got clean in Portland, but he became homeless after the COVID-19 lockdowns.
[01:54:59.254 --> 01:55:01.355]  Went straight back to the streets because that's all he knows.
[01:55:01.635 --> 01:55:03.697]  He says that he's seen people do meth, heroin.
[01:55:03.777 --> 01:55:05.858]  Again, he's smoking the fentanyl and Percocets here.
[01:55:06.158 --> 01:55:07.499]  This is legal in Portland.
[01:55:07.779 --> 01:55:20.388]  Funny thing about this video, too, is I put this on my Instagram, and they took it down for promoting illegal activities, to which I responded, this is legal throughout the entire state of Portland, or Oregon, so I don't know why you're taking this down.
[01:55:21.673 --> 01:55:24.255]  So we're looking at two different phenomenons now.
[01:55:24.395 --> 01:55:28.337]  We've got the Democrats giving needles.
[01:55:28.397 --> 01:55:29.858]  It's the clean needle program.
[01:55:30.298 --> 01:55:35.081]  And so they give out entire drug kits that include needles and other stuff.
[01:55:35.181 --> 01:55:41.045]  And I guess, so in the first individual that we saw passed out on the street there that had overdosed, was he overdosed on heroin?
[01:55:42.449 --> 01:55:44.351]  So it was either heroin or fentanyl.
[01:55:44.471 --> 01:55:54.579]  I did go try to ask the firefighters who came to his aid, to which they responded, well, technically we can't tell you because that would be a HIPAA violation, but they thought it was fentanyl related.
[01:55:54.699 --> 01:55:57.621]  In my report, I do say heroin at first.
[01:55:57.942 --> 01:55:59.823]  Because of the needles, we thought it was heroin.
[01:56:00.303 --> 01:56:04.527]  But again, we really couldn't tell, but the official said potentially fentanyl.
[01:56:05.468 --> 01:56:09.591]  And most of these needles, are these provided by the government?
[01:56:09.631 --> 01:56:10.692]  Are they getting these for free?
[01:56:12.392 --> 01:56:16.337]  So I did ask a couple of the addicts on the ground to which they responded.
[01:56:16.357 --> 01:56:19.060]  They get them from other organizations.
[01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:30.033]  I didn't have enough time during this report to investigate if those organizations are federally funded or funded by the state, which I would imagine they are because that's what happened in San Francisco, right?
[01:56:30.053 --> 01:56:34.814]   You have Urban Alchemy and they provide clean needles for the people
[01:56:34.814 --> 01:56:36.573]  on the streets of San Francisco.
[01:56:36.573 --> 01:56:41.573]   They are funded by the officials in San Francisco, by San Francisco's leaders.
[01:56:41.573 --> 01:56:44.454]  So I imagine it's very similar in Portland.
[01:56:44.454 --> 01:56:49.574]   Now the fentanyl is a little, I'm a little confused about this because we're kind of
[01:56:49.574 --> 01:56:50.574]  getting mixed messaging.
[01:56:50.616 --> 01:56:54.261]  I mean there's no doubt the fentanyl is probably the deadliest street drug right now.
[01:56:54.942 --> 01:57:11.886]   It's killing middle-aged men in this country more than anything else and then we have Reports from Border Patrol and others saying look at all this fentanyl we recovered by the way just this much fentanyl can kill you but yet these guys are out here Smoking fentanyl injecting fentanyl.
[01:57:12.586 --> 01:57:13.807]  How is that the case?
[01:57:13.847 --> 01:57:16.410]  I mean, are they asking for fentanyl?
[01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:17.651]  Is that actually what they want?
[01:57:17.691 --> 01:57:18.952]  They're trying to get the fentanyl.
[01:57:18.972 --> 01:57:20.053]  They don't think it's gonna kill them?
[01:57:21.696 --> 01:57:22.897]  I don't think that they care.
[01:57:22.918 --> 01:57:27.883]  The drug addict that I got on camera, because I did ask him, why do you smoke?
[01:57:28.043 --> 01:57:29.165]  Just be very honest with me.
[01:57:29.225 --> 01:57:31.668]  Why are you doing these hard drugs that you know are bad for you?
[01:57:31.688 --> 01:57:36.173]  To which he responded, well, a little part of you just has to want to die.
[01:57:36.293 --> 01:57:39.657]  He shared with me that he died three times last year.
[01:57:40.157 --> 01:57:44.593]   So again, the people on the streets Really do enjoy fentanyl, I guess?
[01:57:44.773 --> 01:57:45.293]  I don't know.
[01:57:45.353 --> 01:57:56.279]  I mean, I only talked to a couple of drug addicts here, but I think that with the case of fentanyl killing people across the United States, it's because it's laced in a lot of these other more common drugs like cocaine or weed.
[01:57:56.339 --> 01:58:00.481]  We just previously saw, what, three New Yorkers, and these are high-end New Yorkers, if you will.
[01:58:00.501 --> 01:58:05.144]  You had a lawyer, someone who works on Wall Street, and then, I believe, a teacher or social worker who just died from fentanyl.
[01:58:05.164 --> 01:58:07.225]  Not people you would expect from buying cocaine, yeah.
[01:58:08.180 --> 01:58:11.943]  Yeah, exactly, but it's because the cocaine is laced with fentanyl.
[01:58:11.963 --> 01:58:20.029]  So when the people on the streets are smoking fentanyl, like this guy, they know how to dose it out properly, apparently, or they're mixing it with other drugs, but it is very prevalent.
[01:58:20.309 --> 01:58:25.553]  In San Francisco, I already detailed the fentanyl crawl, and you'll go there and you see people hunched over.
[01:58:25.853 --> 01:58:30.096]  It looks like they're dead, and they hunched over for like six hours, and that is fentanyl.
[01:58:30.497 --> 01:58:34.780]  So Portland, maybe their drugs are a little bit different up there, but it definitely is on the streets.
[01:58:35.811 --> 01:59:12.077]   Well it does make you wonder again you brought up the story I think it was two women and a man in New York that bought some cocaine off of a delivery service site and they ended up getting fentanyl laced cocaine three of them died and so obviously fentanyl is is deadly in small doses but yet I guess these drug addicts maybe they're I don't know if they're used to it, or they, like you said, know how to use it properly, because that just, I mean, they just, they know, but they know how deadly it is, right?
[01:59:12.157 --> 01:59:13.019]  So they just don't care.
[01:59:14.181 --> 01:59:15.081]  Yeah, they just don't care.
[01:59:15.121 --> 01:59:18.062]  I asked them point-blank, and they said, well, part of you wants to die.
[01:59:18.082 --> 01:59:20.683]  And the thing is, is they are dying on the street.
[01:59:20.723 --> 01:59:22.084]  Like I said, I was there for two hours.
[01:59:22.104 --> 01:59:24.064]  I'm watching somebody overdose on the side of the street.
[01:59:24.485 --> 01:59:32.087]  And it's because they don't care if they die or not, because they know that the firefighters will come, inject them with Narcan, restart their heart, and then they can continue doing their drugs.
[01:59:32.267 --> 01:59:34.548]  So these people technically are dying from fentanyl.
[01:59:35.608 --> 01:59:37.129]  They're just being revived multiple times.
[01:59:38.598 --> 01:59:50.207]  Now how often, you said, we saw you talking to some law enforcement there, are they basically just patrolling the streets in case at any moment they turn a corner and somebody's passed out on the side of the road and they gotta go revive them?
[01:59:51.872 --> 01:59:57.237]  I mean, the reason the police rolled up to this scene is because we called them.
[01:59:58.058 --> 02:00:03.583]  And I was actually walking down the streets of Portland at night because there was one night where I was like, well, I'm just going to go to this food truck.
[02:00:03.643 --> 02:00:04.804]  It's about a half mile away.
[02:00:04.844 --> 02:00:05.685]  I'll just walk down there.
[02:00:06.085 --> 02:00:09.468]  And the best way I can describe the streets of Portland is like a house of horrors, right?
[02:00:09.688 --> 02:00:14.633]  Like every time you turn a corner, there's something scarier and more disturbing around the next corner.
[02:00:14.913 --> 02:00:23.655]   And so I feel like The police are just in the area, in the vicinity, because every single block you're going to have somebody who is either overdosing, having a schizophrenic episode.
[02:00:23.935 --> 02:00:29.076]  I was walking down the street in the middle of the night and this black man was going, um, I want to kill all white people.
[02:00:29.136 --> 02:00:29.916]  I hate white people.
[02:00:29.976 --> 02:00:30.837]  I'm scared of white people.
[02:00:30.897 --> 02:00:31.697]  I turned down the corner.
[02:00:31.757 --> 02:00:34.037]  This woman is crying and sobbing on the ground.
[02:00:34.537 --> 02:00:36.337]  It's terrifying on the streets of Portland.
[02:00:36.378 --> 02:00:43.399]  So, I mean, I would imagine that there's just police there, busy all hours of the day because of the amount of crime that's taking place.
[02:00:43.679 --> 02:00:50.443]   On top of that as well, Apparently, Portland police do not pull people over for low-level traffic violations anymore.
[02:00:50.703 --> 02:00:53.985]  So you also have people driving throughout Portland without license plates on.
[02:00:54.246 --> 02:00:58.349]  One of the residents that I interviewed said, oh yeah, my neighbor's catalytic converter was being stolen.
[02:00:58.369 --> 02:01:02.151]  We called the police and they asked, hey, is there any way for you to identify the people who were doing this?
[02:01:02.191 --> 02:01:05.654]  To which she responded, no, because they're not driving around with license plates.
[02:01:05.934 --> 02:01:08.735]  So, how are these drug addicts funding their addiction?
[02:01:09.095 --> 02:01:10.055]  Property crimes.
[02:01:10.316 --> 02:01:19.979]  And how are they doing that as well by not getting identified if they're driving either unlicensed vehicles or, you know, again, just not even being arrested because this is legal in the city?
[02:01:21.004 --> 02:01:30.415]  You know, I gotta say, it's always kind of been this way for me as a kid, and maybe others can relate, I'll ask Savannah this on the other side, but I remember, you know, I would go to ballgames and stuff downtown St.
[02:01:30.435 --> 02:01:39.666]  Louis, you'd see homeless people begging for money, and it'd always break my heart, you know, it breaks your heart to see people in that state, but, I mean, to walk down the street and see that, it must be crushing.
[02:01:40.905 --> 02:01:42.326]  Savannah Hernandez is with us.
[02:01:43.127 --> 02:01:48.472]  She's one of those thought criminals that's banned all over the internet, but that doesn't stop her from doing great work.
[02:01:49.233 --> 02:01:55.879]  And so I'm just curious, when you're out there in Portland, it's been a few years since I was there and they threatened to kill me, so I decided to never come back.
[02:01:56.099 --> 02:02:00.103]  I guess that's just a fool's errand to not want to go back to a place that threatens to kill you.
[02:02:03.030 --> 02:02:04.672]  Seeing this has to be heartbreaking.
[02:02:04.792 --> 02:02:07.335]  I mean, I get heartbroken when I see homeless people.
[02:02:07.355 --> 02:02:09.096]  I mean, I don't like seeing it.
[02:02:09.657 --> 02:02:11.018]  I don't like seeing the mental illness.
[02:02:11.038 --> 02:02:12.300]  I don't like seeing the drug abuse.
[02:02:13.821 --> 02:02:14.822]  Doesn't mean I hate those people.
[02:02:14.842 --> 02:02:15.423]  I don't like seeing it.
[02:02:15.443 --> 02:02:16.024]  It breaks my heart.
[02:02:16.044 --> 02:02:19.127]  But, I mean, it looks like Portland is just done.
[02:02:19.347 --> 02:02:23.031]  I mean, the city as a whole just looks completely shot, unlivable.
[02:02:24.795 --> 02:02:31.798]  When I was walking down the street, I walked past a bag of human feces, which is something I haven't even seen in San Francisco or New York.
[02:02:32.458 --> 02:02:34.239]  Granted, you know, those are very big cities.
[02:02:34.299 --> 02:02:36.459]  I was just in downtown Portland in that one area.
[02:02:36.559 --> 02:02:39.240]  But the fact that this is normalized is insane.
[02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:44.383]   Not only the homelessness, the dirtiness, just the straight-up rot of the city, But you're completely right.
[02:02:44.463 --> 02:02:53.050]  I was looking around, and as I was watching a couple of homeless people have a schizophrenic episode on the side of the road, I realized that their leaders have abandoned them.
[02:02:53.110 --> 02:02:58.054]  That these are literally mentally ill people who have been left to rot on the streets of Portland.
[02:02:58.295 --> 02:03:02.238]  And this is what it looks like, truly, when you do give government more power, right?
[02:03:02.278 --> 02:03:06.161]  The power to decriminalize drugs and make this beautiful utopia.
[02:03:06.461 --> 02:03:13.105]   If you look at the West Coast, from California to Washington, This is supposed to be the liberal stronghold, right?
[02:03:13.125 --> 02:03:22.228]  These are supposed to be the examples of what progressive policy looks like, and that's why we never see mainstream media reporters on the ground there, because this is the reality of it.
[02:03:22.428 --> 02:03:35.713]  Their leaders have completely abandoned them, and similarly, our leaders will gladly abandon us, turn America into this third world hellhole, and then they will be so far removed in their ivory towers that they're not seeing or dealing with any of this.
[02:03:36.073 --> 02:03:42.081]  The Portland resident that I spoke to said that homeless people straight up crawl into their homes through open windows or through the doors.
[02:03:42.361 --> 02:03:48.649]  People will come steal cars if they're left idling for too long with children inside of them and just drive off.
[02:03:48.989 --> 02:03:56.497]   So this is the state of Portland and You know, again, going back to the drug users on the ground, these people need help.
[02:03:56.517 --> 02:03:57.358]  They're mentally ill.
[02:03:57.418 --> 02:04:06.306]  I actually had an off-camera conversation with Randall, the guy who was smoking the Percocets and fentanyl, and I asked him, what do you think the legitimate response to this should be?
[02:04:06.366 --> 02:04:08.448]  Because there's clearly people out here who need help.
[02:04:08.728 --> 02:04:11.811]  And he even said, yeah, we need to bring back mental institutions.
[02:04:12.111 --> 02:04:13.753]  And I asked him about his addiction as well.
[02:04:13.793 --> 02:04:17.044]   I was like, I mean, How, how do you, what do you need?
[02:04:17.124 --> 02:04:17.964]  How do you need help?
[02:04:18.024 --> 02:04:19.445]  And how can people help you?
[02:04:19.525 --> 02:04:27.310]  And he just basically was like, yeah, I, I need someone to come in and step in and intervene because I can't combat this addiction myself.
[02:04:27.370 --> 02:04:29.931]  But again, the city leaders have completely abandoned them and it's heartbreaking.
[02:04:29.991 --> 02:04:42.047]   So, um, yeah, it's really difficult to cover these types of stories and I think the worst part of it, too, is that this isn't even an issue that's in one American city.
[02:04:42.247 --> 02:04:44.148]  I have been wanting to go to St.
[02:04:44.208 --> 02:05:02.359]  Louis and Chicago and many of these other Democrat-run cities to highlight how this is an issue that is very common to a specific political leaning ideology, which is why it's so important for us to vote out the evil people in office who have abandoned their constituents and are allowing drug users and drug addicts to rot on the street.
[02:05:03.666 --> 02:05:08.367]  Well, and if you could say, what is the example of a liberal progressive city?
[02:05:08.407 --> 02:05:15.029]  What is the example of when liberal progressive Democrats run a city, and it's Portland, it's San Francisco.
[02:05:15.089 --> 02:05:16.850]  I mean, Portland is beautiful.
[02:05:16.910 --> 02:05:19.951]  The timber up there, the Northwest, it's awesome to look at.
[02:05:19.971 --> 02:05:23.712]  You're driving in, and then you get into the city, and it's just a total hellhole.
[02:05:24.032 --> 02:05:26.012]  It looked like you were talking to a resident there.
[02:05:26.412 --> 02:05:35.606]   How many people are left there that are actually Just common folk just living their lives, going to work, going to lunch, what have you, meeting up with friends and family, going to church.
[02:05:35.626 --> 02:05:37.129]  I mean, how much of that did you see?
[02:05:37.169 --> 02:05:40.956]  I mean, is there any normalcy left there, or is it just all degradation?
[02:05:42.082 --> 02:05:47.846]  I'm actually glad you asked that question because Portland still looks like it's in COVID stages, right?
[02:05:48.126 --> 02:05:51.488]  You go there to downtown and there's barely anybody walking around.
[02:05:51.788 --> 02:05:54.310]  The restaurants there are still closing by 8 p.m.
[02:05:54.350 --> 02:05:54.910]  every single night.
[02:05:54.970 --> 02:06:01.894]  I'd have an early dinner because the restaurants are all closed down, the people are still wearing face masks, everyone is still afraid of COVID over there.
[02:06:03.255 --> 02:06:06.277]  The normal people who were living in Portland have moved out.
[02:06:06.317 --> 02:06:16.665]  There's a very select few who are still willing to deal with the homelessness, the crime, the drugs, the prostitution that is now prospering on the streets of Portland as a result of their lax policies.
[02:06:17.406 --> 02:06:29.094]  So, I mean, the average person walking through Portland truly is like a pink-haired liberal who is wearing a face mask, working at Starbucks and smashing fash on the weekends and, you know, part of their local Antifa group.
[02:06:29.154 --> 02:06:31.476]  So, that's the majority of Portland, unfortunately.
[02:06:32.515 --> 02:06:35.602]  I don't see how Portland recovers from this, quite frankly.
[02:06:35.662 --> 02:06:38.108]  It looks like it's just completely gone.
[02:06:38.268 --> 02:06:39.270]  I don't know how you recover.
[02:06:40.845 --> 02:06:42.005]  Yeah, I have no idea either.
[02:06:42.365 --> 02:06:44.086]  They need to oust their current leadership.
[02:06:44.106 --> 02:06:45.926]  They need to oust Ted Wheeler as mayor.
[02:06:46.266 --> 02:06:50.927]  I even went so far as to go to the nicest parts of Portland as well, just to say, okay, you know what?
[02:06:51.027 --> 02:06:56.669]  I don't want to be a journalist who goes to one sad street on downtown Portland and says, okay, the whole city is disgusting.
[02:06:56.949 --> 02:06:57.849]  I went to the suburbs.
[02:06:57.949 --> 02:06:59.929]  I went to the nicest parts of Portland.
[02:07:00.149 --> 02:07:01.050]  I was in downtown.
[02:07:01.330 --> 02:07:10.240]   And I would venture to say, That the suburbs are even worse because they have pushed a lot of the homeless out of downtown and so they've made their ways to neighborhoods.
[02:07:10.601 --> 02:07:14.466]  If you go and you drive through the neighborhoods in Portland, there's parking lots, right?
[02:07:14.486 --> 02:07:15.087]  There's a street.
[02:07:15.828 --> 02:07:19.691]  And there's several parking lots that, of course, after 6 p.m.
[02:07:19.711 --> 02:07:36.246]  when everyone goes home from work, become filled with people who pitch their tents, who drive up in their trailers, and again, too, there's just entire streets where people have trailers there, and they're just living there on the side of the road, and all the trash around them is piling up, and that's just the normal scene.
[02:07:36.546 --> 02:07:39.649]  So the neighborhoods, if you think downtown is worse, the neighborhoods are much worse.
[02:07:40.185 --> 02:07:41.406]  Yeah, we've seen some of that footage.
[02:07:41.446 --> 02:07:47.191]  Again, there's no trash service when you have a tent outside of the road, so they just end up littering all over the streets.
[02:07:48.993 --> 02:07:57.341]  So, I mean, if you want an example of what liberal progressive leadership will do to the country, look at Portland, look at San Francisco, it's quite clear.
[02:07:57.801 --> 02:08:13.171]   I'm curious though, and maybe you asked some of the drug addicts out there that you talked to, we saw in New York City They put up an illegal immigrant shelter that's like, I mean, it's pretty nice digs, I would say, for an illegal immigrant.
[02:08:13.191 --> 02:08:16.252]  Pretty nice digs for somebody that may be struggling or may be homeless.
[02:08:16.693 --> 02:08:21.514]  Brand new facilities, nice, nice cots, laundry service, nice new bed sheets.
[02:08:21.814 --> 02:08:28.597]  They got like dozens of entertainment centers with new video games, big flat screen TVs, phones free to use.
[02:08:29.477 --> 02:08:38.984]  I mean, if you set something like that up for the homeless, because, I mean, you know here in Austin, there's a homeless shelter here in Austin, nobody goes there because they can't do drugs in there.
[02:08:39.264 --> 02:08:46.509]  So they go hang out outside, they eat their meals two, three times a day when the food is provided, but they don't go in and live there because they want to be able to do the drugs on the streets.
[02:08:46.990 --> 02:08:49.672]  So you go down by the homeless center, it's a bunch of people outside doing drugs.
[02:08:50.172 --> 02:08:53.774]  If they built a facility like that, do you think the homeless would even want to use that?
[02:08:53.794 --> 02:08:55.616]  Or would it just be unused?
[02:08:57.208 --> 02:08:59.770]  I think that there would be some homeless that would use it.
[02:08:59.790 --> 02:09:16.579]   I actually did go speak to residents of the Bronx after Mayor Eric Adams tried to set up his first bailed migrant center in a beach parking lot in the middle of winter in New York, which by the way, I believe the city is allocating $1 billion to making migrant shelters up there and putting these
[02:09:16.579 --> 02:09:23.350]   migrants up in their beautiful video game living room areas. So I do think that the homeless
[02:09:23.350 --> 02:09:28.789]   population would use these types of areas. When I did go speak to residents in the Bronx, they did say, "Yeah,
[02:09:28.789 --> 02:09:33.880]   we do have a very big homeless issue here. The government is allocating so many of our taxpayer
[02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:37.220]   dollars to helping this issue, to helping these illegals."
[02:09:37.429 --> 02:09:42.730]  Meanwhile, the residents here are suffering because the homeless are on the streets, the homeless are sleeping in the subway.
[02:09:42.950 --> 02:09:50.733]  And if you go to New York, there are homeless people who would just ride the subway all day long because it's a warm place for them to sit and they don't have to be outside.
[02:09:50.753 --> 02:09:57.135]  So I do think that these types of areas would be utilized by the homeless and it could help with the issue, but we're too busy spending all of our money on illegals.
[02:09:58.447 --> 02:10:16.852]  Yeah, and Ukraine and all this other stuff, and look, I'm not a socialist, I'm not somebody that likes free handouts, but I'm also logical, and I would say if we can expedite all this money to foreign countries, certainly we can put our own homeless as a priority ahead of that, to try to clean up our cities and help these people out.
[02:10:17.212 --> 02:10:25.715]  I would much rather be doing that with the billions of dollars than sending it to Ukraine or God knows where else, fixing their infrastructure, building them walls and bridges and everything.
[02:10:26.716 --> 02:10:29.277]  I don't think Portland comes back anytime soon, if ever.
[02:10:29.357 --> 02:10:32.219]  I don't think San Francisco comes back anytime soon, if ever.
[02:10:32.900 --> 02:10:35.462]  You've seen the degradation in both of those cities.
[02:10:36.002 --> 02:10:38.484]  And I guess, is this going to be kind of a new tour for you?
[02:10:38.524 --> 02:10:42.567]  Just going to Democrat-run cities and showing what life is like in those cities?
[02:10:43.737 --> 02:10:44.117]  Definitely.
[02:10:44.157 --> 02:10:46.018]  It's a miniseries that I've already started.
[02:10:46.078 --> 02:10:48.679]  I've gone to New York, San Francisco, now Portland.
[02:10:48.959 --> 02:10:54.142]  And like I said, I'm going to keep focusing in on this because there's a reason why Democrats don't want us to see their city.
[02:10:54.182 --> 02:10:59.984]  There's a reason why everyone is trying to, you know, label Republicans as fascist authoritarians, like in Florida.
[02:11:00.024 --> 02:11:00.624]  And why is that?
[02:11:00.644 --> 02:11:04.087]   Because if you go to Florida, You think I'm going to find this on the streets of Florida?
[02:11:04.287 --> 02:11:05.308]  Absolutely not.
[02:11:05.428 --> 02:11:05.589]  No.
[02:11:05.629 --> 02:11:11.975]  So of course they have to attack the leaders of those states because everything is doing so well on the ground and for their residents.
[02:11:12.155 --> 02:11:14.698]  You go to a Democrat-run city, it's absolutely terrifying.
[02:11:14.918 --> 02:11:15.639]  You're not safe.
[02:11:15.859 --> 02:11:18.301]  You're walking past criminals all day, every day.
[02:11:18.341 --> 02:11:19.923]  You're watching people shoot up in the streets.
[02:11:20.083 --> 02:11:21.024]  You're watching robberies.
[02:11:21.044 --> 02:11:21.845]  You're watching crimes.
[02:11:22.065 --> 02:11:23.465]  The business owners are terrified.
[02:11:23.505 --> 02:11:24.606]  People can't even live there.
[02:11:24.646 --> 02:11:25.986]  They don't want to raise their children there.
[02:11:26.226 --> 02:11:35.068]  Remember in New York, parents are now taking their kids to counseling because the kids are so horrified by the drug users that are just ODing on the streets of New York City.
[02:11:35.108 --> 02:11:37.909]  I'm sure the, you know, scene is very similar in Portland.
[02:11:37.949 --> 02:11:41.049]  A lot of people moving out over there because they're like, I don't want my kids around this.
[02:11:41.409 --> 02:11:43.370]  So that's the reality of these cities.
[02:11:43.410 --> 02:11:57.994]   We're going to continue to highlight it because, you know, this administration can continue to bully us and pretend that The open border isn't bringing drugs in every single day and criminals and more homeless, but we're going to continue to expose it because nobody else seems to want to do the dirty work here.
[02:11:58.574 --> 02:12:01.815]  Savsaysofficial.com is her website.

[02:13:26.804 --> 02:13:29.166]  Because these are critical times.
[02:13:30.106 --> 02:13:39.510]  And they're blackmailing and blacklisting everybody that doesn't swallow the crap that they're shoving out and regurgitating.
[02:13:39.530 --> 02:13:42.712]  That's what the mainstream media is.
[02:13:43.612 --> 02:13:47.514]  It's adults with their head in a toilet bowl.
[02:13:49.421 --> 02:13:56.824]  Sucking up the crap and spewing it out and getting angry at you if you don't believe the crap that they believe in.
[02:13:57.764 --> 02:13:59.925]  So do what you can to support InfoWars.
[02:13:59.945 --> 02:14:01.345]  These are very critical times.
[02:14:02.466 --> 02:14:06.927]  Even, you know, they come up with a name like misinformation, which I find sexist.
[02:14:06.988 --> 02:14:08.228]  Misinformation.
[02:14:08.508 --> 02:14:09.909]  Why should it be gender information?
[02:14:10.309 --> 02:14:12.129]  Let's really be stupid about everything.
[02:14:13.450 --> 02:14:15.411]  And I can't say blackballed or blacklisted.
[02:14:15.491 --> 02:14:16.351]  Oh, that's racist.
[02:14:16.391 --> 02:14:18.172]  What could we call it?
[02:14:19.929 --> 02:14:20.650]  Woke listing.
[02:14:22.891 --> 02:14:28.996]  So anyway, they're silencing everybody that doesn't swallow their crap.
[02:14:29.817 --> 02:14:31.478]  And that's, end of story.
[02:14:32.799 --> 02:14:33.620]  End of story.
[02:14:36.002 --> 02:14:45.109]  Speaking of which, swallowing crap, you had that CDC director, you saw this on InfoWars site as well, that she tested positive for COVID-19.
[02:14:46.250 --> 02:14:54.527]   Now this is some arrogant loudmouth Telling everybody to get the shot, get boosted, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:14:55.268 --> 02:14:56.369]  And there you got it.
[02:14:58.530 --> 02:15:01.752]  Totally, totally vaxxed and maxed, vaxxed out.
[02:15:02.753 --> 02:15:03.934]  And she gets the virus.
[02:15:07.336 --> 02:15:15.062]  A vaccine that they said would have a 96% efficacy rate when they sold this to the people.
[02:15:17.492 --> 02:15:19.713]  And now we're going on almost three years later.
[02:15:19.733 --> 02:15:21.813]  It'll be three years in January.
[02:15:21.833 --> 02:15:22.714]  That's right.
[02:15:22.734 --> 02:15:31.996]  The COVID war began in January 2020 out of China on their Lunar New Year, the year of the rat.
[02:15:32.336 --> 02:15:35.117]  And there's a rat seller right looking at you.
[02:15:35.737 --> 02:15:38.798]  A rat seller selling a rat crap.
[02:15:39.418 --> 02:15:41.319]  Why don't you swallow my rat crap?
[02:15:42.972 --> 02:15:44.053]  Get that Vax!
[02:15:44.273 --> 02:15:45.254]  Get that Vax!
[02:15:45.814 --> 02:15:48.036]  Not one word about natural healing.
[02:15:48.697 --> 02:15:51.359]  Not one word about building your immune system.
[02:15:52.540 --> 02:15:54.161]  I know a woman that's a nurse.
[02:15:56.403 --> 02:15:59.145]  Been one for 40 years.
[02:16:01.307 --> 02:16:10.614]  I asked her, when you went to nursing school, did they teach you anything about building up your immune system, eating healthy?
[02:16:12.043 --> 02:16:12.744]  Supplements?
[02:16:13.104 --> 02:16:13.344]  Nope.
[02:16:14.446 --> 02:16:15.707]  Only drugs.
[02:16:16.848 --> 02:16:17.869]  Only drugs.
[02:16:17.929 --> 02:16:26.057]  Remember, there's not one prescription drug that cures Nalotropic disease.
[02:16:26.198 --> 02:16:26.498]  Nothing.
[02:16:29.981 --> 02:16:33.105]  All they do is they do away with the symptom.
[02:16:33.745 --> 02:16:39.305]   And you saw that thing about that That little Chrissy Cuomo, another daddy's boy.
[02:16:39.325 --> 02:16:41.767]  I got the job at CNN, the Cartoon News Network.
[02:16:41.787 --> 02:16:44.289]  They fired me and I got the job with somebody else.
[02:16:44.349 --> 02:16:46.250]  Again, it's one big club and you ain't in it.
[02:16:47.751 --> 02:16:53.556]  And he's having this conversation with Kanye West and West says to him, you know, did you work out today?
[02:16:53.576 --> 02:16:55.057]  He said, no, I didn't work out.
[02:16:55.077 --> 02:17:01.782]  He said, I took my my antidepressants drugs and I take them antidepressants every day.
[02:17:02.403 --> 02:17:04.044]  Oh, antidepressant?
[02:17:05.976 --> 02:17:10.158]  You mean you're so damn whacked out, you gotta get drugged out?
[02:17:10.179 --> 02:17:19.284]  Oh, and you're the arrogant antidepressant guy that shoves his crap out there and gets angry when people won't swallow it?
[02:17:20.224 --> 02:17:22.886]  Oh, remember when little Chrissy was locked down?
[02:17:23.266 --> 02:17:27.529]  Oh yeah, in his house because he had COVID and he wasn't gonna spread it to his kids.
[02:17:28.109 --> 02:17:29.690]  Yeah, and he's going out bicycling.
[02:17:32.079 --> 02:17:43.981]  This COVID war, again, it's in your magazine, the Trends Journal, week after week after week after week, now they're coming out with all the psychological and sociological damage that it caused.
[02:17:45.662 --> 02:17:50.242]  None of it was based on science, only political science.
[02:17:50.502 --> 02:17:51.323]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:52.203 --> 02:17:58.924]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show, and again, as I said, do everything you can to support InfoWars.
[02:17:59.730 --> 02:18:05.014]  Just 7% of Americans have a great deal of trust and confidence in the media.
[02:18:05.535 --> 02:18:07.656]  This is according to a latest Gallup poll.
[02:18:08.477 --> 02:18:09.698]  Just 7%.
[02:18:11.559 --> 02:18:17.624]  But the power they have and the propaganda that they sell, boy, it works perfectly.
[02:18:19.045 --> 02:18:23.548]  This is from today's toilet paper record, the New York Slime.
[02:18:23.588 --> 02:18:26.190]  They call themselves the paper record.
[02:18:26.911 --> 02:18:31.691]   The paper record for selling lies, Fear and hysteria.
[02:18:32.071 --> 02:18:34.291]  Oh no, that's not misinformation.
[02:18:34.512 --> 02:18:36.532]  Oh, I gotta be careful, gender information.
[02:18:37.993 --> 02:18:38.993]  That's a fact.
[02:18:40.074 --> 02:18:45.896]  These are the lowlife scum that sold us the Iraq War.
[02:18:46.936 --> 02:18:47.677]  That's right.
[02:18:49.337 --> 02:18:49.957]  A fact.
[02:18:50.758 --> 02:18:51.318]  A fact.
[02:18:52.879 --> 02:18:56.322]  Ah, them aluminum tubes that he's getting from Niger!
[02:18:56.362 --> 02:18:57.263]  Hell yeah!
[02:18:57.583 --> 02:19:01.787]  Saddam Hussein is getting them and he's building those weapons of mass destruction.
[02:19:02.207 --> 02:19:02.427]  Yep.
[02:19:03.969 --> 02:19:06.391]  This is the garbage that they spew out.
[02:19:06.471 --> 02:19:06.891]  Look at this.
[02:19:08.833 --> 02:19:11.015]  All the news that's fit to print.
[02:19:12.456 --> 02:19:15.439]  You mean all the crap that you want to sell?
[02:19:16.605 --> 02:19:18.546]  Is the news that's fit to print?
[02:19:19.046 --> 02:19:20.267]  Who are you talking to?
[02:19:20.747 --> 02:19:25.890]  Oh, I'm talking to all the Americans that still have a mind like they're in high school.
[02:19:27.071 --> 02:19:30.312]  Yeah, what they call an adult population.
[02:19:30.332 --> 02:19:30.773]  Look at this.
[02:19:31.633 --> 02:19:38.817]  Look at this terrible, terrible picture here of this poor guy doing a push-up with no legs.
[02:19:40.918 --> 02:19:43.339]  Finding camaraderie in recovery.
[02:19:45.623 --> 02:19:57.450]  At an old medical center in Western Ukraine, war amputees are forming a community as they adjust to their new lives.
[02:19:59.712 --> 02:20:00.152]  Terrible.
[02:20:03.394 --> 02:20:05.455]  Then you go to page six and seven.
[02:20:05.475 --> 02:20:11.919]  Look at this.
[02:20:13.240 --> 02:20:13.660]  Look at this.
[02:20:13.860 --> 02:20:14.701]  Terrible, terrible.
[02:20:15.970 --> 02:20:16.670]  Coverage, right?
[02:20:17.591 --> 02:20:18.151]  How sad.
[02:20:21.173 --> 02:20:21.973]  New York Times.
[02:20:23.234 --> 02:20:36.881]  How come you weren't covering, day after day, the amputees from America's Iraq War?
[02:20:38.442 --> 02:20:41.104]  Or, I should say, Iraq War.
[02:20:43.245 --> 02:21:11.935]   Why weren't you covering Every day, the amputees from America's Afghan War, the one that only lasted for 20 years, brought to you by a little daddy's boy with a pair of cojones much smaller than a mothball, a little clown of a moron jerk, George W. Bush.
[02:21:15.620 --> 02:21:16.981]  How come you weren't covering that?
[02:21:17.481 --> 02:21:35.209]  How come you didn't have photos day after day of the American troops that lost their arms and their legs and their minds?
[02:21:37.950 --> 02:21:39.451]  Day after day.
[02:21:39.891 --> 02:21:40.772]  You never did that.
[02:21:40.852 --> 02:21:41.492]  You know why?
[02:21:41.913 --> 02:21:45.755]  Because you're low-life propaganda prostitutes.
[02:21:46.155 --> 02:21:56.502]  You're little media whores that put out for your corporate pimp and your government whoremasters.
[02:21:58.723 --> 02:22:01.685]  Day after day, people see this.
[02:22:01.825 --> 02:22:02.786]  Oh, those Russians.
[02:22:03.246 --> 02:22:04.307]  Look what they're doing.
[02:22:04.807 --> 02:22:06.148]  Look how terrible this is.
[02:22:06.208 --> 02:22:07.189]  Look at this little clown.
[02:22:07.881 --> 02:22:09.022]  Look at these little clowns!
[02:22:10.123 --> 02:22:12.025]  And people swallow their crap!
[02:22:13.466 --> 02:22:16.909]  Yeah, Obama, the Nobel Piece of Crap Prize winner!
[02:22:17.549 --> 02:22:19.411]  I want that guy sought out of there!
[02:22:19.431 --> 02:22:23.614]  I want that guy, uh, Gaddafi out of there!
[02:22:24.355 --> 02:22:26.297]  Quote, I'm really good at killing people!
[02:22:26.317 --> 02:22:29.079]  Oh yeah, little Billy Clinton!
[02:22:29.620 --> 02:22:34.564]  Every time he got caught with his pants down, bombs away over Baghdad!
[02:22:35.413 --> 02:22:45.598]  How come you weren't showing the deaths of the 500,000 children that Bill Clinton killed because of the sanctions he put on Iraq?
[02:22:45.938 --> 02:22:47.559]  Oh no, that's not me talking.
[02:22:47.899 --> 02:23:08.776]   That's Leslie Stahl at 60 Minutes asking Madeline All That Bright, or Not All That Bright, who was the UN ambassador at the time, America's ambassador to the United Nations, is the death of 500,000 Iraqi children worth the sanction?
[02:23:10.397 --> 02:23:11.098]  Yes it is!
[02:23:13.079 --> 02:23:14.600]  How come you didn't sell that?
[02:23:15.921 --> 02:23:16.762]  Who wrote this?
[02:23:19.403 --> 02:23:20.464]  Who put this out?
[02:23:22.866 --> 02:23:26.328]  I'd say, again, yeah, Madeline not all that bright.
[02:23:27.109 --> 02:23:28.330]  Another daddy's girl.
[02:23:33.280 --> 02:23:41.543]  Article by Eric Nagourney and David Guttenfelder.
[02:23:41.823 --> 02:23:42.143]  Yeah.
[02:23:44.484 --> 02:23:45.365]  Guttenfelder.
[02:23:45.505 --> 02:23:46.505]  Gutterfelder!
[02:23:47.325 --> 02:23:48.386]  Gutterfelder!
[02:23:49.386 --> 02:23:49.906]  Yeah, look at these.
[02:23:50.046 --> 02:23:50.827]  Look at these pictures.
[02:23:51.647 --> 02:23:52.767]  This isn't journalism.
[02:23:53.648 --> 02:23:56.029]  But they get the people to hate.
[02:23:56.889 --> 02:24:25.751]   To hate, to hate, to hate the Russians and keep supporting the war and now Ladies and gentlemen and children of all ages, the number now is going to be Congress is trying to push through a bill before they go into the midterms of another $50 billion of our money to send more weapons of death to Ukraine.
[02:24:27.435 --> 02:24:36.783]  That it will now bring the total, since February 24th, up to, you ready?
[02:24:36.803 --> 02:24:53.156]  115 billion bucks of our money going to the military-industrial complex, brought to you by the guy playing our head of the Department of Defense, Lloyd Austin!
[02:24:53.657 --> 02:24:55.558]  Oh, General Lloyd Austin!
[02:24:55.959 --> 02:24:56.219]  Yeah.
[02:24:56.886 --> 02:24:59.448]  General Lloyd Austin, you're a brilliant man.
[02:24:59.488 --> 02:25:01.490]  You did a great job in Afghanistan.
[02:25:01.830 --> 02:25:03.391]  Great job in Iraq.
[02:25:03.691 --> 02:25:04.712]  You're a loser!
[02:25:05.032 --> 02:25:08.355]  Just like Smiley Miley with those baggy eyes.
[02:25:08.876 --> 02:25:10.537]  All you guys... Oh, I forgot.
[02:25:11.438 --> 02:25:12.278]  I forgot.
[02:25:12.298 --> 02:25:19.564]  Lloyd Austin was on the board of directors of Raytheon, the second largest defense contractor.
[02:25:20.129 --> 02:25:25.995]  In the United States before he became our head of the Department of Defense.
[02:25:26.516 --> 02:25:28.357]  No little boys and girls.
[02:25:28.698 --> 02:25:30.600]  It's not a revolving door.
[02:25:30.940 --> 02:25:32.462]  It's an open door.
[02:25:32.482 --> 02:25:34.844]  And they own it.
[02:25:38.448 --> 02:25:38.628]  Yep.
[02:25:43.035 --> 02:25:46.557]  Yeah, look at all that, look at all that, look at all that, that, that, that drag crap.
[02:25:46.618 --> 02:25:48.079]  Oh, look at all the medals I won!
[02:25:48.099 --> 02:25:49.920]  Oh, look at all the medals I won!
[02:25:50.140 --> 02:25:52.181]  What are you, stealing the Boy Scouts?
[02:25:54.743 --> 02:25:55.864]  Save it, man!
[02:25:57.285 --> 02:25:58.906]  Not a word about peace!
[02:26:00.047 --> 02:26:05.351]  Oh, matter of fact, when you talk about peace, you're a piece of crap.
[02:26:06.051 --> 02:26:09.914]  Because Biden came out against that guy, uh, McCarthy.
[02:26:10.934 --> 02:26:15.720]   Who, um, He wants peace, sending less money to representatives.
[02:26:16.380 --> 02:26:23.881]  And Biden said, they said that if they win, they will not likely to fund, to continue to fund Ukraine.
[02:26:24.421 --> 02:26:25.662]  These guys don't get it.
[02:26:26.322 --> 02:26:28.142]  It's a lot bigger than Ukraine.
[02:26:28.722 --> 02:26:29.602]  It's Eastern Europe.
[02:26:29.662 --> 02:26:30.302]  It's NATO.
[02:26:30.662 --> 02:26:33.263]  It's really serious, serious consequential outcome.
[02:26:33.283 --> 02:26:35.543]  Hey, wait a minute.
[02:26:36.964 --> 02:26:38.964]  I don't care about, it's not my business.
[02:26:39.864 --> 02:26:42.626]  There's a border war going on between the United States.
[02:26:43.506 --> 02:26:46.528]  I mean, between Russia and Ukraine for like 300 years.
[02:26:47.088 --> 02:26:48.389]  Oh, and Biden talking tough?
[02:26:48.969 --> 02:26:50.370]  Oh, the draft Dodger Biden?
[02:26:50.890 --> 02:26:51.310]  What'd you get?
[02:26:52.971 --> 02:26:59.135]  You got a bunch of drafts when you went to college, draft affirmants when you went to college, and then you claim you had asthma?
[02:26:59.315 --> 02:27:00.376]  You got asthma?
[02:27:00.696 --> 02:27:00.876]  Yeah.
[02:27:01.476 --> 02:27:03.017]  A-S-S-M-A.
[02:27:03.177 --> 02:27:04.358]  Yeah, that's what you got.
[02:27:05.458 --> 02:27:06.219]  Asthma.
[02:27:07.122 --> 02:27:08.603]  Yeah, and it's hitting your brain.
[02:27:08.683 --> 02:27:10.205]  Oh, that's why I got a draft deferment.
[02:27:11.246 --> 02:27:17.491]  These tough guys, these tough guys, like little Lindsey Graham, couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag.
[02:27:17.711 --> 02:27:19.152]  But boy, do they love war.
[02:27:19.353 --> 02:27:20.714]  They're little war whores.
[02:27:22.996 --> 02:27:23.876]  But they don't put out.
[02:27:25.057 --> 02:27:25.278]  No.
[02:27:27.079 --> 02:27:27.680]  Just kill.
[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:28.921]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:29.401 --> 02:27:31.343]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:31.383 --> 02:27:34.746]  And remember, do everything you can to support InfoWars.
[02:27:35.543 --> 02:27:38.965]  Because they're supporting the truth as the truth is being stolen from us.
[02:27:40.185 --> 02:27:47.749]  And I was talking about the idiocy of going after people that don't want to spend our money to keep bloodying the killing fields of Ukraine.
[02:27:48.409 --> 02:27:53.712]  This war would have been over a long time ago if the United States didn't keep sending in all this dough.
[02:27:54.533 --> 02:27:57.194]  And this is from Politico.
[02:27:58.254 --> 02:28:10.122]   Representative Liz Cheney on Sunday branded Kevin McCarthy, the leader of the Pro-Putin wing of the GOP.
[02:28:12.663 --> 02:28:15.764]  After the House Minority Leader suggested cutting U.S.
[02:28:15.824 --> 02:28:18.405]  funding of Ukraine's war effort.
[02:28:20.286 --> 02:28:25.848]  In an interview with NBC's Chuck Toad, or Todd, or is it Toad?
[02:28:25.868 --> 02:28:27.248]  It's Toad.
[02:28:27.849 --> 02:28:29.469]  Nothing but a little froggy boy.
[02:28:30.210 --> 02:28:32.230]  Meet the Prestitutes, or Meet the Press.
[02:28:33.931 --> 02:28:51.359]   Wyoming Republican who has been Unremitting in her criticism of her party's turn to Trumpism, unleashed a litany of concerns over McCarthy's potential speakership should Republicans win the House in November.
[02:28:51.499 --> 02:29:09.949]   Quote, look, the speaker is second in line to the presidency, Cheney said, at every moment since, frankly, the aftermath of the election of 2020, when my minority leader McCarthy He's had the opportunity to do the right thing or do something that serves his own political purpose.
[02:29:10.009 --> 02:29:12.551]  He always chooses to serve his own political purpose.
[02:29:12.611 --> 02:29:12.871]  Okay.
[02:29:13.252 --> 02:29:14.353]  What is the right thing?
[02:29:15.013 --> 02:29:16.214]  Here's such as the right thing.
[02:29:16.574 --> 02:29:18.896]  Quote, such as aid to Ukraine.
[02:29:19.917 --> 02:29:24.921]  The idea that the party is now long, no longer going to support the Ukrainian people.
[02:29:26.283 --> 02:29:26.803]  You got it.
[02:29:28.004 --> 02:29:29.425]  I'm not a repulsive Ken.
[02:29:30.066 --> 02:29:31.347]  I'm not a demo crap.
[02:29:32.822 --> 02:29:42.966]  I don't support war, but you, Cheney, you, you loser, and they still quote this loser who couldn't win the election.
[02:29:43.446 --> 02:29:44.026]  Loser.
[02:29:44.046 --> 02:29:46.227]  Oh, a daddy's girl.
[02:29:46.247 --> 02:29:48.168]  A little daddy's girl.
[02:29:48.568 --> 02:29:51.869]  You got there because of Dick Cheney.
[02:29:51.889 --> 02:29:53.410]  Oh, I gotta be proper.
[02:29:53.450 --> 02:29:54.550]  I can't get blacklisted.
[02:29:55.310 --> 02:30:08.374]  Penis Cheney, her father, a warmongering, low-life, lying piece of crap that got us into the Iraq War and the Afghan War.
[02:30:09.534 --> 02:30:14.836]  And this is who the media sells, a worthless war hawk-ish.
[02:30:17.257 --> 02:30:17.957]  Clown.
[02:30:19.277 --> 02:30:21.218]  A Cheney clown.
[02:30:22.325 --> 02:30:24.126]  I gotta hear this crap!
[02:30:24.666 --> 02:30:27.127]  That's why you listen to InfoWars.
[02:30:27.467 --> 02:30:31.448]  You don't get this kind of crap, and that's why you subscribe to the Trends Journal.
[02:30:32.009 --> 02:30:34.009]  We would never do things like... Look at this!
[02:30:34.429 --> 02:30:35.290]  Loser!
[02:30:35.770 --> 02:30:36.830]  You're a loser!
[02:30:37.170 --> 02:30:38.971]  You're nothing but a daddy's girl!
[02:30:38.991 --> 02:30:40.852]  You got there because you're lying, daddy!
[02:30:41.192 --> 02:30:41.272]  Oh!
[02:30:41.852 --> 02:30:42.693]  Alex Jones!
[02:30:43.053 --> 02:30:43.913]  Alex Jones was...
[02:30:44.887 --> 02:30:50.112]  Sued for, quote, lying, according to the toilet paper of record, the New York Times.
[02:30:50.492 --> 02:30:57.478]  How about the lies that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and ties to al-Qaeda?
[02:30:59.340 --> 02:31:02.702]  That Bush and Cheney and Wolfowitz.
[02:31:04.004 --> 02:31:07.947]  I can't say the other word, but it starts with an S. It's Wolfer.
[02:31:08.307 --> 02:31:08.908]  You got it.
[02:31:09.608 --> 02:31:10.930]  And ends with a T and an S.
[02:31:13.184 --> 02:31:15.226]  One lying clown after another.
[02:31:15.947 --> 02:31:18.048]  How come they're not brought up on trial?
[02:31:19.490 --> 02:31:21.611]  Alex Jones didn't... I don't believe this!
[02:31:21.792 --> 02:31:22.812]  Why, how dare you?
[02:31:23.113 --> 02:31:38.527]   By the way, go to the Gerald Cilenti or the Trends Journal site on YouTube and judge Napolitano and I We did a, and the judges, this guy's the top constitutional lawyer.
[02:31:39.067 --> 02:31:41.208]  He knows the constitution like nobody else.
[02:31:41.888 --> 02:31:50.932]  You know, the deal is a judge, Judge Napolitano, and about the illegality of bringing Alex Jones up on trial.
[02:31:51.212 --> 02:31:53.733]  This is a violation of the First Amendment.
[02:31:54.293 --> 02:31:59.575]  But the hypocrisy that they could allow Bush and Cheney to get away with these lies.
[02:31:59.935 --> 02:32:01.296]  You know, I had the rally here.
[02:32:01.937 --> 02:32:12.244]  In July, July 23rd at the Four Corners of Freedom over here, the most historic Four Corners in America, the only place with pre-Revolutionary War buildings, where the seeds of democracy was sown.
[02:32:13.045 --> 02:32:14.225]  The Four Corners of Peace.
[02:32:16.347 --> 02:32:23.972]  And I had Phil Giraldi, one of the speakers, along with Napolitano, Scott Ritter, and Phil Giraldi.
[02:32:25.693 --> 02:32:26.293]  Yep, there it is.
[02:32:26.353 --> 02:32:27.454]  That's the one to check out.
[02:32:27.594 --> 02:32:28.575]  You're not going to want to miss it.
[02:32:29.850 --> 02:32:33.211]  And Phil Giraldi was a former top CIA guy.
[02:32:34.391 --> 02:32:36.511]  This again, he was a speaker at my event.
[02:32:37.851 --> 02:32:41.132]  Giraldi was in the office with little Georgie Bush.
[02:32:41.632 --> 02:32:45.453]  Little Georgie... ...Locajones Bush.
[02:32:47.373 --> 02:32:56.535]  Giving him the data, the papers, the information that Saddam Hussein does not have weapons of mass destruction and ties to al-Qaeda.
[02:32:58.495 --> 02:32:58.935]  They told...
[02:33:00.523 --> 02:33:01.944]  Giraldi to leave the office.
[02:33:04.847 --> 02:33:09.551]  Giraldi, being a real man, quit the CIA.
[02:33:10.832 --> 02:33:14.616]  He said the whole CIA knew there were no weapons of mass destruction attached to Al-Qaeda.
[02:33:14.996 --> 02:33:16.057]  Look at this little clown.
[02:33:16.077 --> 02:33:25.946]  88% of the people swallow this little moron clown's crap that we're gonna get Osama Bin Laden, get him alive!
[02:33:26.895 --> 02:33:31.358]  Over in Afghanistan, and they believe the garbage of Mission Impossible.
[02:33:32.379 --> 02:33:34.801]  Yeah, Mission Impossible, you spelt it wrong.
[02:33:36.582 --> 02:33:40.785]  Oh, and they call the people that fight Americans, when Americans invade their country, militants.
[02:33:40.865 --> 02:33:41.305]  I love that.
[02:33:41.626 --> 02:33:42.606]  Iraqi militants?
[02:33:43.147 --> 02:33:44.448]  Try today to... Yeah.
[02:33:44.788 --> 02:33:45.328]  Militant?
[02:33:46.289 --> 02:33:51.072]  If a foreign country comes and tries to take over my country, I'll kill them.
[02:33:51.653 --> 02:33:52.713]  If they try to kill me.
[02:33:52.733 --> 02:33:54.775]  And I'm a militant.
[02:33:56.300 --> 02:33:57.520]  This is sick stuff.
[02:33:58.221 --> 02:34:01.942]  Look, we're going to come back in a little bit and I'm going to talk a lot about the economy and where it's going.
[02:34:02.442 --> 02:34:05.463]  As we went on the air, the markets are up like over 400 points.
[02:34:05.764 --> 02:34:06.384]  What a joke.
[02:34:06.864 --> 02:34:07.404]  What a joke.
[02:34:08.545 --> 02:34:09.085]  The whole thing.
[02:34:09.125 --> 02:34:09.605]  The whole thing.
[02:34:09.625 --> 02:34:11.066]  It's a con game.
[02:34:11.486 --> 02:34:13.186]  We got con artists in front of us.
[02:34:13.546 --> 02:34:15.167]  Look at the clown con artists.
[02:34:15.227 --> 02:34:16.988]  By the way, don't call this a government.
[02:34:17.348 --> 02:34:18.848]  It's an insane asylum.
[02:34:19.549 --> 02:34:23.070]  Again, you look at the cover of the Current Trends Journal.
[02:34:23.790 --> 02:34:25.551]  One flew over the cuckoo's nest.
[02:34:26.550 --> 02:34:26.850]  Yeah.
[02:34:28.311 --> 02:34:28.812]  There it is.
[02:34:30.513 --> 02:34:34.556]  It's not a White House, it's a nut house.
[02:34:36.537 --> 02:34:38.438]  Look at the jerks telling us what to do.
[02:34:40.520 --> 02:34:41.460]  One after another.
[02:34:42.241 --> 02:34:44.122]  Democracy, it's finished.
[02:34:45.383 --> 02:34:45.903]  Here we go.
[02:34:47.104 --> 02:34:48.725]  One flew over to Cuckoo's Nest.
[02:34:49.386 --> 02:34:49.946]  There he is.
[02:34:49.966 --> 02:34:52.208]  The cuckoo in charge.
[02:34:52.228 --> 02:34:54.049]  Another great cover by Anthony Frieda.
[02:34:54.169 --> 02:34:55.130]  What a genius he is.
[02:34:55.796 --> 02:34:56.957]  You know, we talk about things.
[02:34:58.999 --> 02:35:02.442]  It takes us about 10 minutes to talk about what the cover is going to be.
[02:35:02.542 --> 02:35:04.283]  And I come up with an idea.
[02:35:04.323 --> 02:35:05.344]  I say, OK, take it away.
[02:35:05.364 --> 02:35:07.086]  And he takes it away.
[02:35:08.187 --> 02:35:10.709]  But anyway, we're going to come back.
[02:35:10.729 --> 02:35:29.700]   We're going to talk a lot about the economy, because now it's it's more and more likely that the Fed It's not going to be as aggressive as people thought they were, and as we had forecast in the Trends Journal three weeks ago, is now becoming the new.
[02:35:30.920 --> 02:35:35.141]  And that's why your markets are going up, because the whole world is going down.
[02:35:35.741 --> 02:35:39.662]  Don't you wish you were living in Europe where your energy prices are up only about 147%?
[02:35:39.702 --> 02:35:42.843]  Oh, but the markets are up!
[02:35:43.723 --> 02:35:44.983]  And we'll be back again.
[02:35:45.424 --> 02:35:47.084]  Do what you can to support InfoWard.
[02:35:48.180 --> 02:35:50.262]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show!
[02:35:50.422 --> 02:36:00.090]  And, you know, Alex was just saying about, you know, the loss of censorship and, you know, this is a democracy and we're losing that in front of our eyes.
[02:36:00.110 --> 02:36:08.536]  There was an article in yesterday's Global Times, that's the propaganda paper for China.
[02:36:10.077 --> 02:36:19.614]   And the headline reads, Prospects of US-Style Democracy Dims As Americans have less faith in their system.
[02:36:21.394 --> 02:36:22.094]  Global time.
[02:36:22.114 --> 02:36:24.015]  The U.S.
[02:36:24.075 --> 02:36:28.015]  always portrays itself as a defender of democracy across the world.
[02:36:28.836 --> 02:36:31.716]  Ironically, let's just stop right at that.
[02:36:32.096 --> 02:36:35.197]  That's that's the lie, the crap that they always spill out.
[02:36:35.237 --> 02:36:40.158]  We're going to bring freedom and democracy to this country, yo.
[02:36:40.478 --> 02:36:42.478]  As they're stealing it away from us.
[02:36:42.598 --> 02:36:43.159]  But anyway.
[02:36:44.499 --> 02:36:57.908]   Ironically, With the midterm elections just around the corner, results of many opinion polls suggest that an increasing number of Americans are concerned with the accuracy of the midterm elections and the fate of the U.S.-style democracy.
[02:36:59.229 --> 02:37:06.455]  In essence, this is because the U.S.-style democracy deviates from its original intention and has become a political game.
[02:37:07.376 --> 02:37:08.116]  Perfectly said.
[02:37:08.837 --> 02:37:09.177]  You ready?
[02:37:09.818 --> 02:37:12.880]  According to a new poll by the Associated Press N.O.R.C.
[02:37:12.940 --> 02:37:23.868]   Center for Public Affairs Research, Only about half of Americans have high confidence that votes in the upcoming midterm elections will be counted accurately.
[02:37:26.609 --> 02:37:29.810]  Why, you conspiracy theorists, don't you trust these people?
[02:37:30.070 --> 02:37:32.191]  Hey, remember them hanging chads?
[02:37:33.191 --> 02:37:36.272]  Oh, that was back when Gore and Bush were running?
[02:37:36.932 --> 02:37:37.312]  Yeah.
[02:37:37.332 --> 02:37:37.853]  Was it 2000?
[02:37:40.680 --> 02:37:50.065]  Oh, and the guy by the name of JFK won and they say the election was rigged because of James Daley, the very powerful mayor of Chicago at that time.
[02:37:52.447 --> 02:37:57.009]  I was on doing a show on USA Watchdog that night.
[02:37:57.109 --> 02:37:58.650]  He asked me to be on election night.
[02:37:59.951 --> 02:38:02.453]  And you know me, I'm a political atheist.
[02:38:03.093 --> 02:38:04.814]  I look at things the way they are.
[02:38:06.255 --> 02:38:08.116]  And he did a great job.
[02:38:08.136 --> 02:38:14.419]  He had all these screens up of all the data coming in from Microsoft and Google and everywhere, all the data coming in.
[02:38:15.640 --> 02:38:19.742]  And the lines were like this, Trump and then Biden under it.
[02:38:21.103 --> 02:38:22.324]  Going like that, the whole thing.
[02:38:23.224 --> 02:38:30.908]  All of a sudden, like 110,000 votes come in from Wisconsin or Michigan or somewhere, and none of them for Trump.
[02:38:32.029 --> 02:38:34.550]  Wait a minute, you're telling me 100,000 votes came in?
[02:38:35.555 --> 02:38:36.375]  And none for Trump?
[02:38:39.276 --> 02:38:46.218]  And this happened in Wisconsin, Michigan, a number of places, it started happening.
[02:38:47.278 --> 02:38:52.499]  All these mail-in ballots came in, all these numbers came in, all of a sudden, not one for Trump?
[02:38:53.619 --> 02:38:54.860]  And what am I, six years old?
[02:38:54.880 --> 02:39:02.001]  All right, let's say, let's say Biden, let's really be ridiculous and say Biden got 100,000 and Trump only got 10,000.
[02:39:02.081 --> 02:39:02.642]  Nope, not even that.
[02:39:06.129 --> 02:39:08.892]  So of course, you know, it's a crime syndicate.
[02:39:09.952 --> 02:39:10.593]  That's all it is.
[02:39:11.934 --> 02:39:12.975]  They steal our money.
[02:39:13.155 --> 02:39:14.817]  Their names are giving it too big to fail.
[02:39:15.397 --> 02:39:17.359]  And they kill us in wars based on lies.
[02:39:18.720 --> 02:39:20.161]  But go after Alex Jones.
[02:39:20.542 --> 02:39:21.182]  That's fine.
[02:39:21.703 --> 02:39:23.865]  Because he says what you don't want to hear.
[02:39:23.885 --> 02:39:26.527]  So shut him down.
[02:39:27.648 --> 02:39:28.769]  Going on to this article.
[02:39:29.310 --> 02:39:29.630]  You ready?
[02:39:34.463 --> 02:39:37.005]  Nine percent, only nine percent of U.S.
[02:39:37.125 --> 02:39:41.768]  adults think democracy is working extremely or very well.
[02:39:44.789 --> 02:39:45.790]  Just nine percent.
[02:39:47.551 --> 02:39:50.033]  And over half the people say it's not working well at all.
[02:39:52.694 --> 02:39:53.575]  The other half are dead.
[02:39:56.257 --> 02:39:58.538]  That's what's happened to this country in front of our eye.
[02:40:00.579 --> 02:40:01.920]  How it's been stolen from us.
[02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:03.461]  And you could thank the media for that.
[02:40:04.380 --> 02:40:06.521]  Little prestitute girls and boys.
[02:40:08.043 --> 02:40:08.983]  Media whores.
[02:40:09.003 --> 02:40:13.106]  That's all they are.
[02:40:13.666 --> 02:40:16.028]  Put out for their corporate pimps and their government whoremasters.
[02:40:17.689 --> 02:40:19.210]  We give you the truth and trend.
[02:40:20.811 --> 02:40:22.172]  We tell you what's going on.
[02:40:24.154 --> 02:40:24.894]  What it means.
[02:40:25.234 --> 02:40:25.875]  What's next.
[02:40:26.435 --> 02:40:27.156]  And what to do.
[02:40:27.796 --> 02:40:29.097]  But we don't tell you what to do.
[02:40:29.117 --> 02:40:30.398]  We tell you to think for yourself.
[02:40:31.169 --> 02:40:32.029]  I'll give you the story.
[02:40:32.389 --> 02:40:35.111]  This is how we see our analysis of it.
[02:40:35.571 --> 02:40:37.411]  Very, very plain to see.
[02:40:37.451 --> 02:40:41.653]  We don't distort the lie that they do with the other media.
[02:40:41.733 --> 02:40:42.753]  They distort lies.
[02:40:44.374 --> 02:40:45.795]  And they turn lies into truth.
[02:40:49.156 --> 02:40:51.197]  So it's very important to keep this going.
[02:40:52.977 --> 02:40:55.118]  And they're running, they're stealing democracy from us.
[02:40:55.178 --> 02:40:59.740]  Again, this is a major article in the Communist paper of China.
[02:41:00.327 --> 02:41:01.768]  Now go back to the economy.
[02:41:02.788 --> 02:41:06.910]  China was about to take over America as the largest economy in the world.
[02:41:06.950 --> 02:41:09.771]  We've had figured maybe within the next seven years.
[02:41:09.851 --> 02:41:10.851]  That game is over.
[02:41:12.372 --> 02:41:16.193]  Now that the new dictator, the dictator won't leave, she is in charge.
[02:41:16.974 --> 02:41:23.376]  He has what he's done with these COVID lockdowns, zero COVID policy, has destroyed the Chinese economy.
[02:41:24.237 --> 02:41:27.498]  It's also done a lot of damage to other economies, particularly in Europe.
[02:41:28.498 --> 02:41:35.492]   Because for the longest time, Since China's been on the boom, one of your biggest tourist groups have been the Chinese.
[02:41:36.612 --> 02:41:43.658]  And they're going over there and they're buying everything they can, you know, going to the top shops, buying, buying, buying, buying.
[02:41:43.718 --> 02:41:45.379]  No, no, can't travel anymore.
[02:41:45.399 --> 02:41:46.120]  You got to stay home.
[02:41:47.601 --> 02:41:55.006]  So we're going to see, you saw the Hong Kong index today, went down 6%. 6%.
[02:41:59.974 --> 02:42:03.136]  Hong Kong was like the Wall Street of the East at one time.
[02:42:06.858 --> 02:42:10.020]  And again, I used to be on Hong Kong TV when the protests were going on in 2019.
[02:42:10.080 --> 02:42:17.104]  This is a city of 7.5 million people and over a million people took to the streets.
[02:42:18.365 --> 02:42:22.027]  In America, a country of what, 332 million?
[02:42:22.287 --> 02:42:25.109]  You can't get a million people to take to the streets to protest or anything.
[02:42:27.750 --> 02:42:29.251]  They were going to fight the Chinese way.
[02:42:30.216 --> 02:42:32.298]  And I'd be on these shows like 20 minutes.
[02:42:32.698 --> 02:42:36.441]  We take a break, I'd say to the guy doing the reporting, I said, so tell me what's going on.
[02:42:36.481 --> 02:42:37.822]  Mr. Salenti, we're not going to stop.
[02:42:38.482 --> 02:42:39.863]  We're not going to let the Chinese take over.
[02:42:41.565 --> 02:42:45.147]  They launched the COVID war in January 2020, the Chinese.
[02:42:46.288 --> 02:42:47.649]  Closed down the city of Yuan.
[02:42:48.650 --> 02:42:50.411]  Closed down Shanghai, this one, that one.
[02:42:50.672 --> 02:42:51.793]  Closed down Hong Kong.
[02:42:53.654 --> 02:42:54.174]  Benito.
[02:42:55.936 --> 02:42:56.776]  It's a security law.
[02:42:59.321 --> 02:43:03.444]  That was the end of freedom in Hong Kong and now the whole economy is going down.
[02:43:04.185 --> 02:43:06.146]  The economy is going down around the world.
[02:43:07.127 --> 02:43:15.213]  It's being artificially pumped up in the United States and in Europe, but it's still going down in Europe with the record low interest rate.
[02:43:16.094 --> 02:43:27.003]  So now, we had written in the Trends Journal three weeks ago that the Fed's going to meet again on November 1st and 2nd.
[02:43:29.062 --> 02:43:30.403]  The second is a Wednesday.
[02:43:32.665 --> 02:43:35.969]  And then they're going to tell you what they're going to do, how much they're going to raise interest rate.
[02:43:38.811 --> 02:43:42.234]  The talk on the street is that they're going to raise them 75 basis points.
[02:43:43.416 --> 02:43:49.141]  You're seeing what's going on in the housing market, how it's going down in other sectors because of high interest rate.
[02:43:49.764 --> 02:43:55.606]  And then the debt load, if you're in business, you bought buildings, whatever you own, you're going to pay more on your debt.
[02:43:55.746 --> 02:44:01.868]  And the country, of course, with $31 trillion in debt, has to pay a lot more debt as interest rates go higher.
[02:44:03.108 --> 02:44:05.229]  We said that they're not going to raise them that high.
[02:44:05.249 --> 02:44:05.849]  And you know why?
[02:44:05.869 --> 02:44:07.669]  The midterm elections.
[02:44:10.250 --> 02:44:10.610]  That's right.
[02:44:12.211 --> 02:44:14.191]  And you saw the power of the president.
[02:44:15.232 --> 02:44:16.092]  It was Trump.
[02:44:16.482 --> 02:44:26.109]  That pushed Powell to lower interest rates in December 2018, when the December stock market was having one of its worst, since the Great Recession.
[02:44:28.031 --> 02:44:30.192]  And he talked Powell into lowering interest rates.
[02:44:33.815 --> 02:44:35.236]  New President, same game.
[02:44:37.257 --> 02:44:46.714]   You can see, if you start seeing the equity markets keep booming and booming, as we're going into the midterm election, The average person is going to think, oh, things are improving.
[02:44:47.234 --> 02:44:49.096]  The markets, wow, the markets are going up.
[02:44:49.276 --> 02:44:50.117]  Markets are going up.
[02:44:51.618 --> 02:45:02.427]  So we're forecasting, I can't say directly, but we believe that it's a good possibility that they may not raise interest rates 75 basis points.
[02:45:02.607 --> 02:45:06.790]  And now that's becoming the word on the street as well.
[02:45:07.491 --> 02:45:12.915]  The Fed is realizing that inflation is smaller black hole of pain than previously thought.
[02:45:13.652 --> 02:45:16.354]  And stock rallies 16% by year-end.
[02:45:16.374 --> 02:45:18.815]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show!
[02:45:18.835 --> 02:45:26.180]  Yeah, I got carried away there, kept reading what I was reading, but you can see how bad things are going here and what a fraud the whole game is.
[02:45:27.181 --> 02:45:29.062]  And that's all it is.
[02:45:29.702 --> 02:45:31.604]  And that's why you need to support Infowars.
[02:45:31.624 --> 02:45:38.048]  They're stealing our lives away from us, robbing us of freedom and democracy.
[02:45:38.954 --> 02:45:43.637]  And InfoWars is doing what they can to preserve that, so you do what you can to preserve it as well.
[02:45:44.197 --> 02:45:48.079]  And you can do that by buying the great products that they have over there.
[02:45:48.139 --> 02:45:54.843]  As you well all know, one of my favorites is Supermail Vitality, but they have their 1776 Super Sale.
[02:45:54.863 --> 02:45:55.143]  Spear to 76.
[02:45:55.223 --> 02:45:55.384]  Yep.
[02:45:55.404 --> 02:45:56.184]  I'll be 76 next month.
[02:45:56.003 --> 02:45:57.403]  Super sale.
[02:45:57.403 --> 02:45:58.563]  Speared is 76.
[02:45:58.563 --> 02:46:00.642]  Yep.
[02:46:00.642 --> 02:46:02.483]  I'll be 76 next month.
[02:46:02.483 --> 02:46:10.942]   Anyway, you could save up to 50% and you also get your double pay tree points.
[02:46:09.776 --> 02:46:16.082]  And again, most importantly, as well, you're helping yourself, but you're also helping fund the tip of the spear.
[02:46:17.083 --> 02:46:18.244]  And these are crucial times.
[02:46:19.044 --> 02:46:27.852]  And InfoWars needs your sponsorship and support to make it over the line during these historic times when they're trying to shut it down.
[02:46:28.472 --> 02:46:32.075]  But now more than ever, it's essential to keep InfoWars on the air.
[02:46:32.596 --> 02:46:42.235]   And again, as you see with that video on The Trends Journal and Gerald Cilenti with me and the judge, Judge Napolitano.
[02:46:42.875 --> 02:46:52.017]  You have to defend the First Amendment because they've been in violation of the First Amendment by accusing Alex Jones of what he has done.
[02:46:52.037 --> 02:46:55.498]  It has nothing to do with the First Amendment, you know.
[02:46:56.718 --> 02:46:58.018]  So they have these great products.
[02:46:58.058 --> 02:47:24.203]   You get the Survival Shield, you get the Survival Shield X3, They finally got it back in stock, by the way, 50% off Brain Force Ultra, Brain Force Plus, DNA Force Plus, Physi-Magnesium, Organic Green Fiber Cap, and my favorite, Super Male and Female Vitality, 50% off.

[02:48:01.306 --> 02:48:09.008]  You get super high quality items and you help launch the info war into the next level.
[02:48:10.028 --> 02:48:18.990]  And the next level, of course, is you want to bring it down to no level at all, only their level, the level of stupidity, the mainstream media.
[02:48:19.010 --> 02:48:19.610]  It's a joke.
[02:48:20.351 --> 02:48:20.871]  It's a joke.
[02:48:20.931 --> 02:48:25.732]  It's a, you know, I quoted the woman who runs Fox.
[02:48:25.872 --> 02:48:39.196]   They had an article in the toilet paper record in New York Times about how She made it very clear that you have to play to your audience, both conservative audience, and you don't want to put information on there that may upset them.
[02:48:39.856 --> 02:48:41.857]  That's not journalism, that's a TV show.
[02:48:42.517 --> 02:48:43.418]  That's a sitcom.
[02:48:43.818 --> 02:48:45.078]  You're playing to an audience.
[02:48:45.218 --> 02:48:46.499]  You don't play to an audience.
[02:48:47.099 --> 02:48:52.101]  I could care less what you think, what you believe, what you wish, what you want, and what you hope for.
[02:48:52.121 --> 02:48:59.684]  In the Trans Journal Magazine, we put out the facts, we tell you where it's going, what it means, what to do, and what's next.
[02:49:00.834 --> 02:49:01.915]  Well, you like it or not.
[02:49:02.796 --> 02:49:03.977]  So that's not journalism.
[02:49:05.118 --> 02:49:07.039]  So there's very little journalism left.
[02:49:07.640 --> 02:49:10.862]  And again, InfoWars leaves you with an open mind.
[02:49:12.203 --> 02:49:22.352]  And they're trying to close that open mind and put you into the insane asylum that the one flew over the cuckoo's nest is that is our government.
[02:49:23.893 --> 02:49:25.254]  Talking more about the economy.
[02:49:25.294 --> 02:49:28.697]  There's an article today in Wall Street on Parade.
[02:49:29.480 --> 02:49:30.421]  Which is a great site.
[02:49:30.461 --> 02:49:33.243]  She puts up some real good stuff on what goes on.
[02:49:34.704 --> 02:49:40.749]  And they report that the Fed head over there in St.
[02:49:40.809 --> 02:49:47.754]  Louis, James Bullard, gave a private invitation only briefing on October 14th.
[02:49:48.055 --> 02:49:48.415]  You ready?
[02:49:48.855 --> 02:49:50.196]  The clients of Citigroup.
[02:49:51.698 --> 02:49:52.138]  Citigroup.
[02:49:54.079 --> 02:50:01.478]   They go on to note that Citigroup got Between 2007, you ready?
[02:50:01.498 --> 02:50:01.478]  2010.
[02:50:02.178 --> 02:50:11.744]  Got a cumulative sum of 2.5 trillion dollars in secret loans.
[02:50:16.727 --> 02:50:17.367]  From the government.
[02:50:18.668 --> 02:50:18.888]  Yep.
[02:50:20.709 --> 02:50:21.570]  Bush and Obama.
[02:50:23.650 --> 02:50:26.530]  Stealing our money to give it to the bankster gangsters.
[02:50:26.530 --> 02:50:32.210]  Disgusting.
[02:50:32.210 --> 02:50:42.209]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:50:33.794 --> 02:50:34.554]  Democracy?
[02:50:34.574 --> 02:50:35.235]  It's a joke.
[02:50:35.275 --> 02:50:35.795]  It's dead.
[02:50:35.815 --> 02:50:42.938]  Oh, and they got that guy now that's gonna be running as Prime Minister over there in the UK, Sunak.
[02:50:43.858 --> 02:50:44.698]  Oh yeah, look him up.
[02:50:45.499 --> 02:50:46.339]  Oh, where'd he come from?
[02:50:47.239 --> 02:50:50.521]  Oh, he was a Goldman Sachs gang member at one time.
[02:50:51.561 --> 02:50:53.182]  Oh, and then he started his own hedge funds.
[02:50:53.222 --> 02:50:53.702]  Hedge fund?
[02:50:54.562 --> 02:50:55.903]  You mean gambling syndicates?
[02:50:57.704 --> 02:50:59.144]  They're all on the inside game?
[02:50:59.164 --> 02:51:00.645]  They make all that dough?
[02:51:02.301 --> 02:51:05.424]  There were no such thing as hedge funds or private equity groups when I was a young guy.
[02:51:05.444 --> 02:51:09.107]  It was a whole different country.
[02:51:09.127 --> 02:51:10.408]  It was the middle class.
[02:51:13.911 --> 02:51:15.152]  Now it's all corporate time.
[02:51:15.572 --> 02:51:16.753]  The bigs have gotten everything.
[02:51:20.716 --> 02:51:23.058]  So the markets are up over 400 points.
[02:51:24.559 --> 02:51:27.982]  As I said, you're reading the headlines here.
[02:51:28.743 --> 02:51:31.145]  The Fed is realizing that inflation is smaller.
[02:51:32.483 --> 02:51:34.364]  The black hole of pain than previously thought.
[02:51:36.225 --> 02:51:38.886]  And they may not raise interest rates as much as they can.
[02:51:40.907 --> 02:51:41.968]  In a note on Monday.
[02:51:44.249 --> 02:51:51.113]  Recent comments by federal officials which dialed back some of the hawkishness at Royal Markets this year.
[02:51:51.133 --> 02:51:55.115]  And the inflation remains high.
[02:51:55.815 --> 02:52:11.558]   The Feds Loretta Meister, James Bullard and Neil The Sharkery, whoever's name is, Sharkman, have made comments suggesting the Fed could pause on rate hikes in December.
[02:52:12.978 --> 02:52:16.559]  That led Stock Rally last week to spike Nick's corporate earnings.
[02:52:17.039 --> 02:52:17.619]  They got it.
[02:52:18.320 --> 02:52:21.260]  Corporate earnings are down and they're going to lower rates.
[02:52:24.721 --> 02:52:26.142]  And I believe they're going to lower them.
[02:52:26.162 --> 02:52:32.924]   There's a good chance that they're going to lower them before Midterm elections again.
[02:52:32.944 --> 02:52:37.625]  They meet on November 1st and 2nd, 2nd to Wednesday.
[02:52:37.645 --> 02:52:43.066]  And now Wednesday, let's say they come up with only 50 basis points.
[02:52:44.547 --> 02:52:56.429]  Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday, Tuesday, five days of soaring stock market are going to be very positive for the Democrat at the midterm election.
[02:52:57.729 --> 02:53:00.170]  Remember, it's the economy stupid.
[02:53:00.762 --> 02:53:06.045]  That was the phrase that murderous Bill Clinton used in 1992.
[02:53:06.445 --> 02:53:08.946]  That was the behind-the-scenes campaign slogan.
[02:53:09.606 --> 02:53:12.928]  Let's keep focusing on the economy because it's a pocketbook issue.
[02:53:13.708 --> 02:53:16.449]  Oh, and now the latest data came out?
[02:53:16.710 --> 02:53:19.851]  63% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.
[02:53:21.472 --> 02:53:24.193]  While the rich keep getting richer, the bigs keep getting bigger.
[02:53:25.594 --> 02:53:27.755]  So, then you're seeing gold prices.
[02:53:29.295 --> 02:53:35.238]  To me, gold prices should be skyrocketing, considering all the global instability.
[02:53:36.698 --> 02:53:46.543]  And remember now, when they raise interest rates, even if they raise them, you know, 75 basis points, does that bring them up to like the overnight 3.25%?
[02:53:47.323 --> 02:53:48.804]  Or when you have inflation running at 8.3%?
[02:53:49.204 --> 02:53:51.585]  That's nothing.
[02:53:52.105 --> 02:53:53.206]  You have negative interest rates.
[02:53:54.567 --> 02:53:59.523]   Over in Europe, You're looking at over 9% inflation.
[02:54:01.084 --> 02:54:07.927]  And what do you have at your interest rate?
[02:54:07.947 --> 02:54:07.927]  0.75%?
[02:54:09.769 --> 02:54:10.849]  Deep negative interest.
[02:54:11.850 --> 02:54:16.512]  And even with these low interest rates, look at how the economy is slowing down.
[02:54:17.133 --> 02:54:21.035]  Look at the data coming out about the worries about the people can't paying off their car debt.
[02:54:23.596 --> 02:54:24.357]  One after another.
[02:54:25.140 --> 02:54:27.781]  Look at the number of mortgage applications that went way down.
[02:54:28.422 --> 02:54:29.943]  Look at how home sales are going way down.
[02:54:31.303 --> 02:54:42.670]  And as I keep saying, the biggest crash you're ever going to hear is when the business, commercial business offices go bust.
[02:54:44.090 --> 02:54:47.472]  Because the work at home trend is here to stay.
[02:54:48.813 --> 02:54:57.527]   People don't want to commute an hour and a half Back and forth to work, especially with gas prices rising and everything else going up.
[02:54:57.547 --> 02:54:59.348]  During a COVID war, they love to stay home.
[02:55:00.528 --> 02:55:01.649]  You're going to see a crash.
[02:55:01.749 --> 02:55:07.872]  All the money that they, all the buildings that they bought, all the money that they owe, one after another.
[02:55:08.613 --> 02:55:11.715]  So it's going to go down really hard, really big, really fast.
[02:55:12.975 --> 02:55:14.156]  So prepare for the worst.
[02:55:15.277 --> 02:55:17.738]  If the worst doesn't happen and you're prepared, you lose nothing.
[02:55:18.979 --> 02:55:23.062]  If the worst happens and you're not prepared, you lose everything.
[02:55:23.082 --> 02:55:27.886]  So, one of the ways to prepare, of course, is with the Trends Journal magazine, TrendsJournal.com.
[02:55:28.427 --> 02:55:31.029]  There's no magazine like it in America, in the world.
[02:55:32.110 --> 02:55:34.552]  No trend, there's no trends magazine out there.
[02:55:34.572 --> 02:55:36.834]  They call trends magazines, talking about fashion.
[02:55:38.895 --> 02:55:41.818]  And the other way you do it is by supporting InfoWars.
[02:55:42.779 --> 02:55:44.740]  Because they're putting out a lot of great information.
[02:55:44.579 --> 02:55:47.860]   I go there every day to see what they're doing and they have what you need.
[02:55:47.860 --> 02:55:55.819]  You know where the CIA tunes in, right?
[02:55:55.842 --> 02:55:56.965]  You know where the Russians tune in?
[02:55:56.985 --> 02:55:58.108]  You know where everybody tunes in, right?
[02:55:58.128 --> 02:56:01.035]  You know who Tucker Carlson tunes into, and Joe Rogan, and Elon Musk?
[02:56:01.195 --> 02:56:02.258]  You know where they tune in, right?
[02:56:02.478 --> 02:56:03.120]  They tune in right here!
[02:56:04.153 --> 02:56:06.874]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[02:56:07.514 --> 02:56:12.875]  We are witnessing the Mark of the Beast system openly rolled out and announced.
[02:56:13.355 --> 02:56:23.817]  Whether you believe the Bible is inspired by God or the Word of God or not, what was written over 2,000 years ago by John the Revelator on the Isle of Patmos is coming true.
[02:56:23.977 --> 02:56:34.541]   A world government that makes you take a mark in the hand or the head to be able to buy and sell and that you must worship the beast, that means Follow what the beast says, or you can't buy or sell.
[02:56:34.701 --> 02:56:36.823]  It's not just that you have to have the mark to buy or sell.
[02:56:37.683 --> 02:56:43.907]  You've got to do what the beast wants you to do, or you cannot buy and sell.
[02:56:44.047 --> 02:56:47.029]  And that's where, in late 2022, we are.
[02:56:47.210 --> 02:56:57.416]  Last week, the World Economic Forum was given over $100 million by the Government of Canada to roll out a World ID through the UN based on the Communist Chinese digital social credit score system.
[02:56:57.556 --> 02:57:00.098]  And now, just today, Bill Gates came out.
[02:57:00.398 --> 02:57:01.259]  Here's the article right here.
[02:57:01.899 --> 02:57:10.665]  And his foundation donated $200 million to expand digital ID surveillance system for the same Chinese communist control program.
[02:57:10.745 --> 02:57:22.313]  So the social credit score, communist China, and all the control you see is the model of this system being rolled out in Spain, rolled out in Italy, rolled out in Germany, rolled out in Canada, and now they're trying to roll it out here in America.
[02:57:22.393 --> 02:57:30.399]  Just a few years ago, Klaus Schwab, head of the WEF, said, you will have to take a microchip to buy and sell in the near future.
[02:57:31.019 --> 02:57:31.919]  And now here we are.
[02:57:32.600 --> 02:57:58.611]  So this is a huge, huge issue, that they can then dictate to you, through this new digital currency, through this World ID, every action you take in your life, with a carbon tax, through the social credit score, through universal basic income, as they shut off the regular economy and small businesses, making you sign on for a government handout, but with that handout comes all of the rules of the game.
[02:57:59.892 --> 02:58:04.113]  This is no longer theoretical on some drawing board or some computer.
[02:58:04.754 --> 02:58:10.315]  This is something the bureaucrats and the megacorporations and major governments are doing.
[02:58:10.355 --> 02:58:17.318]  There's a race between the West and Communist China to see, with big tech, who can put this in first.
[02:58:18.775 --> 02:58:21.856]  It's scary, but at least we are exposing it.
[02:58:22.157 --> 02:58:23.077]  And at least we know about it.
[02:58:23.357 --> 02:58:38.264]  Just last week, PayPal said, if you criticize government, if you criticize open borders, or forced injections, or anything else, gun control, we're going to fine you $2,500 for what we say you're doing in your own personal life.
[02:58:38.284 --> 02:58:40.885]  We're going to surveil you, and then we're going to censor you.
[02:58:41.647 --> 02:58:45.831]  But within days of the announcement, they had to back off because of the backlash.
[02:58:46.652 --> 02:58:48.694]  So submitting to this only makes things worse.
[02:58:49.154 --> 02:58:52.157]  Standing up to it and saying no only makes things better.
[02:58:52.778 --> 02:59:04.469]  And that's why it's so important today, ladies and gentlemen, to say no to World War, no to nuclear war, no to open borders, no to pedophilia, no to the Satanism that is the New World Order.
[02:59:04.549 --> 02:59:06.091]  And you cannot do that better.
[02:59:07.284 --> 02:59:21.587]  Then sharing the articles and videos and links from InfoWars.com and Band.Video to be the Paul Reveres of your era and to get amazing products that God gave us through Mother Nature to empower our stamina, our energy, our libido, everything else including our immune systems.
[02:59:21.687 --> 02:59:29.809]  And that's why if you want to support the InfoWars at this critical time, go to InfoWarsStore.com and get X3, the missing link for health that blocks the bad halogens.

[02:59:33.650 --> 02:59:34.171]  50% off.
[02:59:34.251 --> 02:59:39.494]  We've got a Save Info Wars 1776 Mega Sale running for the next week.
[02:59:39.574 --> 02:59:44.278]  The biggest sales up to 60% off in the history of Info Wars at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:59:44.217 --> 02:59:48.217]   Thank you so much and join us during this important part of history.
[02:59:48.217 --> 02:59:57.976]   You got us the amazing sponsor a few years ago that have been great.
[02:59:58.055 --> 03:00:02.399]  The problem was everybody sold out of high quality but at the same time affordable sat phones.
[03:00:02.439 --> 03:00:03.861]  They finally got them back in.
[03:00:03.961 --> 03:00:08.826]  They also have this amazing bivy stick dongle that turns any phone into a sat phone.
[03:00:08.986 --> 03:00:11.689]  Spend a few minutes telling folks about Infowarsphone.com.
[03:00:11.869 --> 03:00:21.992]  Well, first of all, anybody who's watched what happened in Florida absolutely saw people without power, people without communication, and the word when you lose communication is you panic.
[03:00:22.392 --> 03:00:36.475]   The nice thing about satellite phone stores is the owners have dedicated themselves to making sure everyone can stay in touch with their loved ones if they understand How fragile the electrical grid is and also the cell phone communication grid.
[03:00:36.535 --> 03:00:40.816]  I'm told that there are hundreds of thousands of people without cell phones in Florida.
[03:00:40.936 --> 03:00:49.819]  And what was neat about Satellite Phone Store, Alex, they sent out vans and were finding people that had to communicate to let their loved ones know that they're alive.
[03:00:50.099 --> 03:00:53.760]  Communication in a survival situation is paramount.
[03:00:54.020 --> 03:00:58.643]  Not just to be keeping in contact with your loved ones, but for information services.
[03:00:58.723 --> 03:01:02.385]  So the BivyStick obviously is satellite to satellite.
[03:01:02.785 --> 03:01:08.268]  You use your cell phone in airplane mode, but this is probably one of the neatest things there is.
[03:01:08.389 --> 03:01:14.272]  The difference between the BivyStick and satellite phone is a voice communication, but you're limited to the amount of text you can send.
[03:01:14.372 --> 03:01:18.796]  With a bivy stick, you can give messaging and that's one of the things that's so important.
[03:01:19.056 --> 03:01:21.118]  And these are free, just with a year contract.
[03:01:21.158 --> 03:01:24.121]  They have the satellite phones back in stock.
[03:01:24.481 --> 03:01:25.162]  You mentioned that.
[03:01:25.222 --> 03:01:27.684]  A thousand of them, I believe, available at the end of October.
[03:01:27.724 --> 03:01:28.865]  They've got the bivy stick.
[03:01:28.905 --> 03:01:30.907]  The package comes with a free phone.
[03:01:30.967 --> 03:01:32.688]  They have a satellite uplinks.
[03:01:32.748 --> 03:01:36.071]  They have the storage battery, the power solar generators.
[03:01:36.151 --> 03:01:41.356]  In essence, they are a one-stop communication and electrical production facility.
[03:01:41.476 --> 03:01:43.318]  Go to InfoWarsPhone.com or 941-955-1020.
[03:01:43.338 --> 03:01:43.378]  941-955-1020.
[03:01:43.398 --> 03:01:44.339]  That's InfoWarsPhone.com or 941-955-1020.
[03:01:44.379 --> 03:01:45.520]  This is essential.
[03:01:45.680 --> 03:01:46.441]  Everybody needs this.
