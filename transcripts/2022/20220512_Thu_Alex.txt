[00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:13.113]  Thursday live, Republicans must file articles of impeachment against Biden for cutting off America's energy and obliterating our southern border, or they themselves are guilty of treason.
[00:00:14.293 --> 00:00:16.294]  Now is the time to move for impeachment.
[00:00:17.574 --> 00:00:24.836]  And not on the distractionary issues they've used, which you can't 100% prove because the courts won't hear it, though we have the evidence.
[00:00:25.437 --> 00:00:29.478]  Election fraud, making up Russiagate, no.
[00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:34.212]  You impeach him on the deliberate shut off of U.S.
[00:00:34.272 --> 00:00:42.214]  energy and the deliberate shut off of the food supply on record and his own department heads bragging that it's part of a transition.
[00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:45.235]  We have them.
[00:00:47.036 --> 00:00:47.936]  He would be impeached.
[00:00:48.436 --> 00:00:51.357]  Democrats would be forced to vote for the impeachment.
[00:00:52.917 --> 00:00:54.578]  Then your argument is, well, what about Kamala Harris?
[00:00:54.598 --> 00:00:55.558]  What about Nancy Pelosi?
[00:00:55.578 --> 00:00:56.599]  We'll impeach them too.
[00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:00.900]  The stinking Democrats impeached Trump twice for no reason.
[00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:03.806]  But never had the trial in the Senate.
[00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:04.727]  We have the evidence.
[00:01:05.768 --> 00:01:07.030]  Their operations were bluffs.
[00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:18.802]  We can put on the evidence the Great Reset and how they said they were part of the Great Reset and Build Back Better, and how it's a program to force us onto the green economy, but it's really a program to force us into bankruptcy and force us onto welfare.
[00:01:19.463 --> 00:01:21.024]  I'll give the analysis hour or two.
[00:01:22.286 --> 00:01:23.006]  You want victory?
[00:01:24.408 --> 00:01:25.189]  Now is the time.
[00:01:29.905 --> 00:01:34.905]  rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:34.905 --> 00:01:36.905]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:36.905 --> 00:01:46.905]   President Trump gives every indication by what he says and what he does and what he doesn't do
[00:01:46.905 --> 00:01:49.905]  that he's mean as a wolverine.
[00:01:57.905 --> 00:02:03.905]   It's 11.59 at Radio Free America and this is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn.
[00:02:03.977 --> 00:02:07.558]  Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[00:02:07.978 --> 00:02:09.578]  The chair is against the wall.
[00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.699]  The chair is against the wall.
[00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.960]  John has a long mustache.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.941]  John has a long mustache.
[00:02:16.301 --> 00:02:19.042]  It's 12 o'clock, Americans, another day closer to victory.
[00:02:18.981 --> 00:02:23.621]   And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[00:02:23.621 --> 00:02:28.981]  [Music]
[00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:30.981]  But they took a lot of people away.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.960]  People that they thought were gonna make trouble for them.
[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.821]  People that had guns or things they wanted, they just took them away.
[00:02:36.401 --> 00:02:36.701]  Where?
[00:02:37.762 --> 00:02:39.602]  Re-education camps, that's what they call it.
[00:02:39.862 --> 00:02:47.785]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:02:47.605 --> 00:02:52.605]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:58.605]   And we need the kind of camps that you all run. I mean, really.
[00:02:58.605 --> 00:03:02.605]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register.
[00:03:02.678 --> 00:03:09.665]  Now they were taken to racetracks and fairgrounds where the army almost overnight had built assembly centers.
[00:03:09.945 --> 00:03:13.508]  What kind of a situation in the U.S.
[00:03:13.548 --> 00:03:14.589]  would you see that happening?
[00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:18.653]  I mean, we've got a lot of constitutionalism, a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[00:03:19.213 --> 00:03:27.543]  Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[00:03:29.185 --> 00:03:35.031]  These people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to the United States.
[00:03:34.971 --> 00:03:39.971]   It's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community.
[00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:48.971]  It's what we're doing here, and let's not kid about it.
[00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:52.971]   We're building a domestic army because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[00:03:52.971 --> 00:03:55.971]  Put your gun down, really?
[00:03:55.971 --> 00:03:57.971]  [applause]
[00:03:57.311 --> 00:04:01.735]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:04:02.315 --> 00:04:03.857]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:04:04.157 --> 00:04:06.159]  Are you some kind of a constitutionalist?
[00:04:08.837 --> 00:04:13.865]  So these people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not.
[00:04:14.385 --> 00:04:16.669]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:21.109]   If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:41.028]   President Trump gives every indication by what he says and what he does and what he doesn't do.
[00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.391]  That he's mean as a wolverine.
[00:04:50.012 --> 00:04:54.393]  WOLVERINES!
[00:04:54.433 --> 00:05:01.429]   Therapists in the US say they are seeing increasing numbers of Total Trump Anxiety Disorder.
[00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:03.089]  Trump Anxiety Disorder.
[00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.210]  Trump Derangement Syndrome.
[00:05:08.852 --> 00:05:11.693]  Trump Derangement Syndrome is clinically real.
[00:05:11.713 --> 00:05:18.055]  It doesn't merely affect individuals, but entire political parties, rendering them unrecognizable.
[00:05:18.416 --> 00:05:20.256]  One minute, they're perfectly normal.
[00:05:20.396 --> 00:05:21.797]  The next, rapid.
[00:05:25.942 --> 00:05:29.587]  The veneer of civilization is evaporating quickly.
[00:05:29.667 --> 00:05:32.070]  Families and culture are collapsing.
[00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.090]   And godless leftists are behaving just like zombies of modern lore.
[00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.729]  You can't trust your mother.
[00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:42.930]  Get the hell out of here!
[00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.450]  Get the f*** out of here!
[00:05:45.227 --> 00:05:46.068]  Get the fuck out of here!
[00:05:46.108 --> 00:05:46.509]  Your best friend.
[00:05:46.549 --> 00:05:47.770]  Get that camera out of my face!
[00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.391]  The neighbor next door.
[00:05:49.411 --> 00:05:55.577]  Psychologist Dr. Stuart Bassman says for his clients it started the morning after the election.
[00:05:55.637 --> 00:05:59.901]  Doctors are seeing patients suffering from Trump anxiety disorder.
[00:05:59.921 --> 00:06:05.947]  The number of people are manifesting what I would call post-traumatic stress disorder.
[00:06:05.947 --> 00:06:14.589]  It's an overpowering fear that President Trump represents the end of the world.
[00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.030]  Prey, it doesn't happen to you.
[00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:24.792]  Land of the dead!
[00:06:25.292 --> 00:06:30.293]  Revit.
[00:06:30.133 --> 00:06:31.133]  White males.
[00:06:31.133 --> 00:06:32.133]  (Screaming)
[00:06:32.133 --> 00:06:33.133]  (Music)
[00:06:33.133 --> 00:06:34.133]  You're the Madness of White Males.
[00:06:34.133 --> 00:06:58.133]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:06:58.059 --> 00:06:59.400]  What's wrong?
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.461]  What am I supposed to do?
[00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:03.502]  What do I have to do?
[00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:08.761]   The best thing you can do every single year is get out of here.
[00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:16.761]   The first year I was in the first year, I reduced the deaths in Europe to the extent of that by three.
[00:07:16.761 --> 00:07:26.100]   When you had an economy of a great, great, great, great, many people would have been out of their house, but even
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.761]  more importantly, they had no hope.
[00:07:27.761 --> 00:07:34.761]   The middle of all lines sitting in, throwing chemical mines out of all kinds of vehicles,
[00:07:34.761 --> 00:07:39.761]  just to get a bunch of food, and then they're drunk.
[00:07:40.145 --> 00:07:41.185]  How quickly do we forget?
[00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:43.426]  Give me more hurry!
[00:07:45.226 --> 00:07:47.487]  And what is it that my government want to do?
[00:07:48.487 --> 00:07:49.368]  Forget it.
[00:07:50.128 --> 00:07:50.968]  Forget it.
[00:07:52.169 --> 00:08:01.169]   Because in the United States of America, the idea that people will have to wait in line an hour, hour and a half
[00:08:01.169 --> 00:08:06.169]  to get a box of food is a disgruntlement.
[00:08:06.169 --> 00:08:08.169]  This is not a way to live.
[00:08:08.169 --> 00:08:16.169]   That has got to be the most insane gaslighting I've ever seen.
[00:08:16.081 --> 00:08:22.542]  It'd be like if somebody walked up to you and hacked your arm off with an axe.
[00:08:23.652 --> 00:08:26.314]  And they started waving the axe around saying, call the police!
[00:08:26.354 --> 00:08:28.256]  Somebody attack this man with an axe!
[00:08:30.838 --> 00:08:33.480]  How dare Trump cause these food shortages?
[00:08:33.541 --> 00:08:35.482]  How dare he cause this inflation?
[00:08:35.782 --> 00:08:37.764]  How dare he cause these gas prices?
[00:08:38.104 --> 00:08:41.467]  How dare he cause all these food processing plants to blow up?
[00:08:41.527 --> 00:08:44.330]  How dare he cut off all the different resources?
[00:08:45.749 --> 00:08:47.630]  Unbelievable!
[00:08:48.390 --> 00:09:09.231]   Now, we have an archivist, and it's not about proving we were right, it's about people understanding that the globalists are doing this to them, and I want the archivist to go back two years ago, or 26, 27 months ago, right through up until about a year ago, And get the clips of where I said when the first world collapses under this designed Great Reset, because that's what the plan is.
[00:09:09.251 --> 00:09:10.393]  That's how we know what's going to happen.
[00:09:11.014 --> 00:09:15.242]  What's so frustrating, we have the whole battle plan, and people are just starting to only listen now.
[00:09:17.116 --> 00:09:19.438]  And I said, when the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[00:09:20.579 --> 00:09:41.776]  This is an exact formula, formulae, that has been used in the third world and in former first world countries to have the IMF and World Bank come in the last 60, 70 years, pay off their politicians to bring in these policies to implode everything, then they come in and buy it all up for pennies on the dollar, and the country never emerges out of the debt hellhole it's in.
[00:09:42.984 --> 00:09:44.925]  This is conquest through economic fraud.
[00:09:45.385 --> 00:09:47.105]  This is what the New World Order is.
[00:09:47.185 --> 00:09:48.426]  It's what we're now living.
[00:09:50.626 --> 00:09:54.067]  In 2002, Greg Palast, back with the BBC, still did some good work.
[00:09:54.087 --> 00:09:56.428]  Investigative American journalist, best-selling author.
[00:09:56.448 --> 00:09:57.348]  We should get him back on the show.
[00:09:57.368 --> 00:09:58.788]  In fact, get Greg Palast back on, please.
[00:09:58.808 --> 00:09:59.249]  We'll come on.
[00:09:59.609 --> 00:10:03.730]  He's a real liberal, but he may be scared to come on because I'm so right-wing, according to the media now.
[00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:11.352]  He got over a thousand pages of secret documents when he attended a World Bank, IMF-World Bank joint forum.
[00:10:12.554 --> 00:10:13.875]  Was in Greece, if I remember correctly.
[00:10:14.375 --> 00:10:17.417]  And we published some of those documents and it went super viral.
[00:10:17.758 --> 00:10:19.479]  Biggest story we'd ever broken up in that time.
[00:10:19.819 --> 00:10:21.901]  He covered it on the BBC, it got almost no attention.
[00:10:22.901 --> 00:10:52.190]   And in those documents, it's a 100-point plan to come in, buy out the politicians, divide the country along racial and religious lines, and then slowly devalue the currency while the special interests buy up all the infrastructure and hand the debt and the inflation to the people Who were then enslaved to the same private central banks that set the policy and then loaned the money to them that was then paid back to them through the money laundering scams.
[00:10:54.271 --> 00:11:04.013]  And you can look up those documents, Infowars.com, Greg Pallast, the IMF riot, things like that will bring up the original documents and articles on Infowars.
[00:11:04.033 --> 00:11:09.474]  I also put a chapter in my book, 9-11, Descent into Tyranny, on it as well in 2002.
[00:11:10.114 --> 00:11:15.452]   So there's nothing more frustrating Than having the enemy battle plan.
[00:11:15.893 --> 00:11:16.633]  Here's an analogy.
[00:11:19.555 --> 00:11:24.559]  Let's say the police are given a diary they find in a ditch.
[00:11:26.341 --> 00:11:38.350]  And the diary says, starting next month on this date, I'm gonna go to this particular, this is hypothetical, I'm not saying I'll do this, it's a hypothetical parable, an analogy, a story, illustrated.
[00:11:39.011 --> 00:11:41.713]  I'm gonna go to this Baptist church and I'm gonna shoot everybody in it.
[00:11:42.714 --> 00:11:46.036]  And on this next date, I'm going to go to this Catholic church and I'm going to shoot everybody in it.
[00:11:46.756 --> 00:11:51.778]  And then on this next date, a month later, I'm going to go to this local Buddhist temple, and it names the temple, and I'm going to shoot everybody in it.
[00:11:52.799 --> 00:11:55.840]  Well, the police aren't sure what it is, if it's fiction or not.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:01.202]  Maybe they sent a squad car to the church on the date, but he doesn't see anything.
[00:12:01.242 --> 00:12:04.504]  He gets a call of a wreck.
[00:12:04.524 --> 00:12:05.224]  He's got to go to it.
[00:12:05.264 --> 00:12:08.526]  He leaves, and a crazy person goes in and shoots 20 people and leaves.
[00:12:09.437 --> 00:12:17.888]  Now, do you think the cops are going to pay attention to the next dates at the Catholic Church and the Buddhist temple and the Muslim mosque?
[00:12:19.651 --> 00:12:25.579]  Yeah, at the next location on the next date, there's going to be 50 police there with snipers on the roof, and there should be.
[00:12:27.133 --> 00:12:27.913]  It's the same thing here.
[00:12:28.113 --> 00:12:29.414]  We have the globalist blueprint.
[00:12:29.454 --> 00:12:30.474]  We have the globalist plan.
[00:12:30.694 --> 00:12:31.674]  They say what they're going to do.
[00:12:31.714 --> 00:12:33.195]  They're following it exactly.
[00:12:33.735 --> 00:12:35.916]  And they haven't just attacked one target they said they would.
[00:12:36.096 --> 00:12:39.117]  They've done hundreds of things they said they would do in exact order.
[00:12:39.737 --> 00:12:45.739]  And then we're going to just watch the next thing happen, and the next thing happen, and the next thing happen, and the next thing happen, and the next thing happen.
[00:12:46.459 --> 00:12:51.841]  And that's why I am just pulling what little bit of hair I've got left out of my big fat head.
[00:12:53.717 --> 00:13:02.843]  Because it is so frustrating to know the formula, the program, how these criminals operate the same over and over again and follow patterns.
[00:13:02.903 --> 00:13:04.004]  It's basic criminology.
[00:13:04.425 --> 00:13:11.229]  And they're bragging how they're doing it because they're in charge and they want their minions to be confident about their operation succeeding.
[00:13:13.851 --> 00:13:15.873]  Let me tell you what's coming up today, speaking of that.
[00:13:17.037 --> 00:13:20.139]  Big article on InfoWars.com by Jamie White.
[00:13:20.319 --> 00:13:21.500]  So damn important.
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:27.523]  I'm going to have it added as another link to the live show feed today so you can't miss it because it came out last night.
[00:13:29.685 --> 00:13:30.165]  W.E.F.
[00:13:30.225 --> 00:13:37.449]  Davos Summit aims to restore trust, quote, in globalist institutions amid great reset push.
[00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:39.190]  They know they're in trouble.
[00:13:40.851 --> 00:13:42.032]  They know they're being exposed.
[00:13:43.993 --> 00:13:44.954]  And what is their program?
[00:13:45.434 --> 00:13:46.435]  Have a global lockdown.
[00:13:46.495 --> 00:13:47.396]  Starve the third world.
[00:13:47.536 --> 00:13:49.758]  Organize the third world to flood the first world.
[00:13:50.238 --> 00:13:52.900]  Allow Russia and China to launch their military operations.
[00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:55.522]  While the West launches its military operations.
[00:13:55.562 --> 00:13:58.665]  But globalists, above it all, coordinating the different sides.
[00:14:00.426 --> 00:14:02.007]  They don't control the sides, but they're coordinating.
[00:14:02.027 --> 00:14:05.790]  Because they've got their operatives in key places that have penetrated all the major governments.
[00:14:06.151 --> 00:14:08.653]  Enough to be able to manipulate, in most cases, the outcome.
[00:14:10.063 --> 00:14:12.324]  Devalue the currencies while they handle the wealth themselves.
[00:14:12.684 --> 00:14:16.065]  Create massive racial and religious strife.
[00:14:17.485 --> 00:14:25.968]  Bankrupt the general public so that the main carrying system of the economy and of food production and of transportation and energy collapses.
[00:14:26.508 --> 00:14:28.088]  Think cloud and pivot on steroids.
[00:14:29.709 --> 00:14:31.269]  And if you don't know what that is, you better look it up.
[00:14:31.769 --> 00:14:34.250]  Because you and I and all of us are living it.
[00:14:35.356 --> 00:14:37.577]  This is life and death information.
[00:14:37.637 --> 00:14:44.901]  It's like if the police were given a serial killer's battle plan, mailed to the police department.
[00:14:44.921 --> 00:14:49.164]  A lot of serial killers do this because they like the fun of teasing the system and rubbing people's noses in it.
[00:14:49.444 --> 00:14:50.705]  It's psychotic psychology.
[00:14:50.725 --> 00:14:52.145]  That's why Gates goes around and brags.
[00:14:53.646 --> 00:14:56.508]  He says, I'm going to kill all of you for your own good, but also take this shot.
[00:14:56.528 --> 00:14:57.088]  I want to save you.
[00:14:58.189 --> 00:15:00.550]  And the Zodiac Killer would send police letters and clues.
[00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:01.091]  What is he going to do?
[00:15:01.111 --> 00:15:03.252]  Well, imagine if someone just sent you the whole battle plan.
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:10.903]  And said, on this date, I'm going to start killing X, Y, and Z. And then on that date, they killed X, Y, and Z. You'd start paying attention.
[00:15:11.944 --> 00:15:32.575]  And that's what I go back to here, is we're sitting here, knowing what the next shoe to drop is, and I really don't want to evacuate to our ancestral ranch in East Texas, because they shut down the internet as we know it, and bring in the selective internet kill switch, and all the carnage that's going to be involved in that.
[00:15:35.219 --> 00:15:39.689]  Because they want an organized civil war as the icing on this situation in the Western world.
[00:15:40.953 --> 00:15:48.514]  To be the further system that collapses all confidence in the government and all confidence in the system so they can bring it all down and bring in their new system.
[00:15:48.775 --> 00:15:50.015]  That doesn't mean the government's perfect.
[00:15:50.335 --> 00:15:51.995]  It doesn't mean that I defend what it does.
[00:15:52.035 --> 00:15:52.755]  I want to reform it.
[00:15:52.975 --> 00:15:55.096]  But they want to burn it all down.
[00:15:55.416 --> 00:15:58.796]  That's what the Great Reset is, to build back better on it.
[00:15:59.097 --> 00:16:06.418]  And they live in their armored fortresses and compounds and on their private jets and their 100,000 acre ranches and palatial facilities.
[00:16:06.998 --> 00:16:13.921]  And they are executing this operation, and if people aren't aware of the operation, you don't have, I don't have a chance in hell.
[00:16:13.941 --> 00:16:15.361]  But we're going to walk through it all.
[00:16:15.461 --> 00:16:17.662]  It is a gigantic broadcast today.
[00:16:18.222 --> 00:16:24.825]  Believe me, you're going to want to hear and see this, and you're going to want to share it, and you're going to want to resist what's happening, because it's only going to get worse until you start standing up.
[00:16:25.645 --> 00:16:26.505]  To me, there's no choice.
[00:16:26.525 --> 00:16:29.507]  Get on your knees and starve to death, or stand up and be prosperous and win.
[00:16:30.307 --> 00:16:33.888]  And make your ancestors proud of you, and your progeny proud of you as well.
[00:16:33.908 --> 00:16:35.389]  We're at the crossroads.
[00:16:35.409 --> 00:16:35.789]  Stay with us.
[00:16:36.963 --> 00:16:46.387]  Thursday live, Republicans must file articles of impeachment against Biden for cutting off America's energy and obliterating our southern border.
[00:16:47.067 --> 00:16:49.709]  Or they themselves are guilty of treason.
[00:16:54.010 --> 00:17:00.453]  I am going to start that important analysis and indictment publicly at the start of the next hour.
[00:17:00.493 --> 00:17:01.634]  You'll want to join us for that.
[00:17:02.414 --> 00:17:04.415]  Now is the time to move for impeachment.
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:12.942]  And not on the distractionary issues they've used, which you can't 100% prove because the courts won't hear it, though we have the evidence.
[00:17:13.562 --> 00:17:17.683]  Election fraud, making up Russiagate, no.
[00:17:19.543 --> 00:17:22.344]  You impeach him on the deliberate shutoff of U.S.
[00:17:22.404 --> 00:17:30.346]  Energy and the deliberate shutoff of the food supply, on record at his own, department heads bragging that it's part of a transition.
[00:17:32.747 --> 00:17:33.327]  We have them.
[00:17:35.185 --> 00:17:36.046]  He would be impeached.
[00:17:36.566 --> 00:17:39.488]  Democrats would be forced to vote for the impeachment.
[00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:42.710]  Then your argument is, well, what about Kamala Harris?
[00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:43.670]  What about Nancy Pelosi?
[00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:44.731]  We'll impeach them too.
[00:17:46.612 --> 00:17:51.935]  The stinking Democrats impeached Trump twice for no reason, but never had the trial in the Senate.
[00:17:51.995 --> 00:17:52.836]  We have the evidence.
[00:17:53.885 --> 00:17:55.166]  Their operations were bluffs!
[00:17:55.686 --> 00:18:06.912]  We can put on the evidence the Great Reset, and how they said they were part of the Great Reset and Build Back Better, and how it's a program to force us onto the green economy, but it's really a program to force us into bankruptcy, and force us onto welfare.
[00:18:07.572 --> 00:18:09.113]  I'll give the analysis hour or two.
[00:18:10.414 --> 00:18:11.114]  You want victory?
[00:18:12.535 --> 00:18:13.335]  Now is the time.
[00:18:14.316 --> 00:18:15.176]  I woke up at 3 a.m.
[00:18:15.216 --> 00:18:19.859]  last night, and I had these epiphanies and a cold sweat.
[00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:23.710]  I normally sleep like a dead emperor.
[00:18:26.071 --> 00:18:33.052]  And I just got up for like an hour and sat there in the starlight in my backyard and really mapped all this out.
[00:18:35.273 --> 00:18:37.353]  I think you know deep down too it's the right time for this.
[00:18:37.973 --> 00:18:46.795]  And this way we can put major heat on Republicans as a litmus test of whether they're patriots or whether they're rhinos or neocons and force them to support the impeachment move.
[00:18:47.335 --> 00:18:51.076]  It will then illustrate the crimes of Biden and his controllers.
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:56.124]  And it will force Democrats to defend him and hurt them in the midterms.
[00:18:56.564 --> 00:18:58.887]  It'll hurt neocons and rhinos and Democrats worse.
[00:18:59.367 --> 00:19:07.516]  If the Republican cowards like Mitch McConnell and others don't do it, well, that just illustrates it all the more.
[00:19:09.538 --> 00:19:12.581]  So let me just tell you what's coming up, then I'll hit it all next segment, because this is incredible.
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:14.960]  This is just unbelievable.
[00:19:15.341 --> 00:19:19.322]  The stack of the economy being shut down by design is just over the top.
[00:19:19.342 --> 00:19:20.022]  We'll hit that first.
[00:19:20.602 --> 00:19:24.283]  Then we knew this was going on because I've experienced it and it's been in the news.
[00:19:25.284 --> 00:19:28.405]  But this huge FBI whistleblowers released all the documents, all the proof.
[00:19:28.485 --> 00:19:29.305]  It's just incredible.
[00:19:32.306 --> 00:19:41.509]  Merrick Garland lied to Congress when he said that they had not given FBI terror tags, anybody protesting critical race theory or pedophile drag queen story time.
[00:19:42.793 --> 00:19:47.035]  Well, now the documents have all come out, and it's exactly what we knew was going on.
[00:19:47.095 --> 00:19:48.576]  This is stuff out of North Korea.
[00:19:48.876 --> 00:19:50.857]  This is stuff out of East Germany under the Stasi.
[00:19:51.177 --> 00:19:52.938]  I mean, this is on a scale of 1 to 10.
[00:19:53.258 --> 00:19:53.978]  This is a 10.
[00:19:54.098 --> 00:19:57.380]  I mean, this is just illegal as hell.
[00:19:59.561 --> 00:20:00.041]  You got that?
[00:20:01.551 --> 00:20:19.865]  We got the geopolitical news, unbelievable developments in Ukraine, and this mainstream news, AFP, it's all being reported by the American military news, China surrounds Taiwan in their own words for massive invasion, rehearsal drills, opening up a true front war in Ukraine and now there.
[00:20:22.776 --> 00:20:26.277]  We've got a lot of the big abortion fight news and some good news on that front.
[00:20:26.918 --> 00:20:31.099]  Managing to oppose a Democratic bill guaranteeing abortion rights as a federal law.
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.681]  We have just got so much to break down here today.
[00:20:37.461 --> 00:20:42.283]  The big free speech fight that is going into overdrive as well.
[00:20:43.363 --> 00:20:44.524]  It is all coming up today.
[00:20:44.544 --> 00:20:48.405]  I mean, just look at this.
[00:20:48.745 --> 00:20:54.784]   I almost came in here today And only covered this.
[00:20:57.346 --> 00:21:01.429]  Because I could spend a whole 3-4 hours on this enchilada right here.
[00:21:03.391 --> 00:21:04.912]  You know, the Russians lie.
[00:21:05.853 --> 00:21:07.935]  Just like any major government does, especially in a war.
[00:21:07.995 --> 00:21:08.855]  That's part of war.
[00:21:09.416 --> 00:21:11.557]  When they said they weren't going to invade Ukraine, and they weren't.
[00:21:13.019 --> 00:21:16.862]  We told you back in October the word was they were, because we had military sources over there.
[00:21:18.271 --> 00:21:24.455]  But when they do tell the truth, I'll tell you, and I'll tell you, the Russians lie about 10% as much as the globalists do.
[00:21:25.415 --> 00:21:27.917]  Just because they know when you lie all the time, nobody believes anything you say.
[00:21:28.497 --> 00:21:29.198]  You become a clown.
[00:21:29.878 --> 00:21:31.519]  Not lionizing the Ruskies.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:37.523]  But this news, it's on Gateway Pundit, it's on InfoWars.
[00:21:38.914 --> 00:21:48.541]  Ukraine bioweapon update, Russia implicates Pfizer, Moderna, Merck, Obama, Soros, Clintons, Bidens, Rockefellers, and others.
[00:21:49.061 --> 00:22:00.450]  And I've studied this so much for decades, but the last 26-7 months of the whole COVID attack plan, that I know that everything the Russians said is dead on, if not hardcore enough.
[00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:01.951]  In fact, it's not dead on.
[00:22:02.511 --> 00:22:04.913]  It's about 90% as hardcore as it should be.
[00:22:06.598 --> 00:22:42.479]   But it's the German documents, it's the US documents, it's the NATO documents, it's the Eco Health Alliance documents, it's all the stuff that's already come out and the Russians put out a big report in English and Russian with links to all of it and I went and looked at the links, I spent an hour on this this morning, it's all real, it's all stuff we already covered, but they put out a really nice blueprint of how they did it and how it's part of a biomedical world takeover Just from an economic perspective, that'll allow Big Pharma to take over the planet.
[00:22:42.799 --> 00:22:47.981]  The Russians don't even address the fact that they're making us permanently sick with this plan for the biomedical system.
[00:22:48.001 --> 00:22:53.664]  So they don't go the rest of the way about depopulation, the rest of the way, they just show all the documents of this takeover.
[00:22:54.064 --> 00:23:01.267]  Powerful report by Kellen McBrain, who's reported this before the Russians did.
[00:23:03.243 --> 00:23:07.265]  Even before the war started over there, Kellan McBreen reported on it before February.
[00:23:07.705 --> 00:23:09.246]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:23:10.586 --> 00:23:13.448]  Right now, Ukraine bio-update, bio-weapon lab update.
[00:23:13.468 --> 00:23:14.868]  You've got to go read this for yourself.
[00:23:15.028 --> 00:23:18.550]  RT did a story on it from the angle of serious scenario.
[00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:21.971]  Possibly Ukraine, Russia, military warrants.
[00:23:22.291 --> 00:23:25.553]  Because that's a footnote, or not a footnote, but a sub-chapter of the report.
[00:23:28.171 --> 00:23:33.413]  Where they explain, just like they tried to set the Russians up with chemical attacks in Syria, which was later confirmed.
[00:23:33.893 --> 00:23:35.834]  That was mainstream news confirmed years after we broke it.
[00:23:35.854 --> 00:23:42.336]  Because the damn Al-Qaeda and ISIS people would brag to get money back home if they show themselves launching a chemical attack.
[00:23:42.356 --> 00:23:46.397]  So, the West was saying it was the Russians, but the Al-Qaeda would film themselves doing it.
[00:23:46.417 --> 00:23:51.739]  Because, again, they'd get millions of dollars back home when everybody saw that donated to them.
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.400]  That's how they go make a living.
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:57.001]  They don't get blown up and killed and their family gets, you know, a couple million bucks.
[00:23:58.473 --> 00:23:59.573]  Well, they launched a chemical attack.
[00:24:00.114 --> 00:24:01.034]  They got a couple million bucks.
[00:24:03.615 --> 00:24:07.736]  And the whole point is they're planting a false flag in Ukraine as a pretext for the U.S.
[00:24:07.796 --> 00:24:09.977]  and NATO to openly come into the war, and then we're off the races.
[00:24:10.397 --> 00:24:10.998]  World War III.
[00:24:11.018 --> 00:24:12.558]  So we're trying to stop that.
[00:24:12.578 --> 00:24:17.900]  But when we come back, what they've done to the economy is even more devastating than I thought it would be this quick.
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.081]  They are acting fast to break this country.
[00:24:20.441 --> 00:24:24.383]  And if Congress doesn't move with impeachment over this, then they're culpable.
[00:24:24.743 --> 00:24:26.143]  This is cutting the energy off, folks.
[00:24:26.183 --> 00:24:27.304]  You can't let them do this.
[00:24:27.384 --> 00:24:28.104]  It must stop.
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:35.184]  I've been watching, and I've been waiting for them to make their move, and now they've made their move big time, and we are in the fight of our lives.
[00:24:36.985 --> 00:24:45.311]  I think it's beyond critical for listeners and viewers to realize that you are the vanguard of people that are the most awake, and the hope and future of the world lies with you.
[00:24:47.932 --> 00:25:14.375]  Now ladies and gentlemen, if you take one of these stories we're going to cover by itself, it's bad enough, but when you add all of these concerted attacks together, and then you have the Davos Group, the Bilderberg Group, the UN, the Club of Rome, the IMF, the World Bank, the Ex-Im Bank, and the big think tanks, the Carnegie Endowment, the Rockefeller Endowment, admitting they're coordinating this, and admitting they're doing it on purpose, it is outrageous!
[00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:22.213]  That we continue to allow this to happen, and I'll talk about how we need to peacefully, legally, lawfully remove Biden.
[00:25:22.874 --> 00:25:26.116]  Even if he's a puppet, even if they plan that down the road, it doesn't matter.
[00:25:26.276 --> 00:25:29.598]  It's our duty to engage in justice, though the heavens may fall.
[00:25:30.779 --> 00:25:35.962]  And we cannot survive what they're doing right now, and everybody needs to get that through their head.
[00:25:37.423 --> 00:25:42.266]  I mean the legislatures, and the governors, and the Congress.
[00:25:42.346 --> 00:25:45.428]  I've got three clips here that I didn't even ask for, I'm glad they're there.
[00:25:46.801 --> 00:25:50.863]  My point is that these just showed up here, because there's so many of these things being said.
[00:25:51.904 --> 00:25:56.526]  To illustrate my point, of man, Biden's kicking his own ass, said Senator Kennedy.
[00:25:56.787 --> 00:25:59.168]  Man, the Democrats are the biggest morons ever.
[00:25:59.188 --> 00:26:01.229]  Boy, they sure are destroying the country.
[00:26:01.509 --> 00:26:02.970]  They're a bunch of inept fools.
[00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:04.731]  They're not inept fools.
[00:26:05.531 --> 00:26:21.986]   Yeah, they're evil, soulless people they put in charge as placeholders, but the Corrupt institutions and organizations and individuals pulling the strings are ruthless and are engaged in economic and cultural and spiritual warfare against us.
[00:26:23.988 --> 00:26:31.592]  And so I'm going to say it, our biggest problem is not the Democratic Party or it's not the Labour Party in the UK or other leftist groups, because we know who they are.
[00:26:32.995 --> 00:26:44.543]  Our problem is people claiming they're conservatives, claiming they're nationalists, claiming they're Christians, claiming that they are capitalists, when they are pretending like they're actually fighting.
[00:26:45.844 --> 00:26:47.405]  And I get why they pretend.
[00:26:47.706 --> 00:26:50.668]  You actually fight them, your plane crashes like Nigel Farage, he barely lived.
[00:26:50.948 --> 00:26:51.768]  The pilot later died.
[00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:59.274]  They come over to your house, they break your ribs and puncture your lungs and try to kill you and your family.
[00:27:00.438 --> 00:27:02.519]  And they come to baseball games and try to shoot you dead.
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:04.621]  And put bullets into members of Congress.
[00:27:06.022 --> 00:27:06.642]  And they sue you.
[00:27:07.102 --> 00:27:08.123]  And they try to indict you.
[00:27:08.543 --> 00:27:09.464]  And they lie about you.
[00:27:09.524 --> 00:27:10.164]  Believe me, I know.
[00:27:10.224 --> 00:27:10.765]  I've been through it.
[00:27:11.965 --> 00:27:18.209]  But I can't roll over to these thugs because it's only going to get worse the more we submit.
[00:27:20.151 --> 00:27:26.746]   Evil has hijacked almost every facet of the corporate system. They've got Hollywood 100%, they've
[00:27:26.746 --> 00:27:31.296]   got half of Congress, they got 40-something percent of the states, they got most of the
[00:27:31.296 --> 00:27:31.884]  big cities.
[00:27:31.884 --> 00:27:38.286]   They are making their move right now before we fully wake up. So let me hit these incredible
[00:27:38.286 --> 00:27:44.686]   stories and they all tie together and each one is more insane than the next. Gulf state OPEC
[00:27:44.686 --> 00:27:52.046]  members sound alarm about dwindling global energy capacity.
[00:27:52.195 --> 00:27:59.879]  Not the amount of fuel, gas, oil, and refined fuel, but because they're not delivering the capacity.
[00:27:59.959 --> 00:28:02.660]  It's being blocked everywhere by the globalists.
[00:28:04.261 --> 00:28:07.243]  Inflation is more persistent than many have thought.
[00:28:07.303 --> 00:28:07.503]  St.
[00:28:07.543 --> 00:28:10.365]  Louis Fed Chief says, really?
[00:28:10.405 --> 00:28:10.825]  Think so?
[00:28:10.845 --> 00:28:12.806]  It's up at 8 to 11 percent.
[00:28:13.246 --> 00:28:13.786]  Breaking U.S.
[00:28:15.495 --> 00:28:18.418]  Producer Price Index, a measurement of inflation, reaches 11%.
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:24.504]  The numbers are always a few months behind in April, obviously accelerating upwards.
[00:28:26.586 --> 00:28:27.807]  Now here's where it gets really sick.
[00:28:29.168 --> 00:28:36.435]  With gas prices at all-time highs, Biden decides to cancel oil and gas lease sales in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:28:37.355 --> 00:28:44.519]  And the head of the Department of Energy says it's part of a transition when we don't even have the electricity capacity that everybody had electric cars.
[00:28:45.259 --> 00:28:50.001]  They're claiming they're giving you a new system when they're taking the system away and giving you nothing.
[00:28:50.221 --> 00:28:58.886]  It's like saying this perfectly good boat that you're out in the ocean on, a hundred miles from land, in high seas, we're going to sink it and we're going to give you this new boat.
[00:28:59.546 --> 00:29:00.907]  And you walk over and you go, where's the boat?
[00:29:00.947 --> 00:29:02.347]  They go, it's just right down there in the water.
[00:29:02.387 --> 00:29:05.169]  Just walk this plank, jump right in the water and the boat will appear.
[00:29:08.936 --> 00:29:11.778]  We can impeach this whole group of rats, like that.
[00:29:11.958 --> 00:29:16.482]  They got national polls out, where 90-something percent of Democrats say the number one issue is energy.
[00:29:17.062 --> 00:29:19.384]  And 90-something percent of Republicans say it's the main issue.
[00:29:20.465 --> 00:29:21.886]  And 80-plus percent in other polls.
[00:29:22.246 --> 00:29:24.528]  I mean, people are pissed and they get it!
[00:29:25.589 --> 00:29:32.374]  We don't have baby formula, but $40 billion can be shipped to Zelensky to launder half of it back to the globalists.
[00:29:35.796 --> 00:29:41.460]  With gas prices at all-time highs, Biden decides to cancel oil and gas lease sales in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:29:42.541 --> 00:29:45.283]  So he's already shut them down across the country, now he's intensifying it.
[00:29:46.584 --> 00:29:50.046]  Real wages fall again as inflation stays near 40-year high.
[00:29:50.066 --> 00:29:55.810]  Again, cancels more oil and gas leases as fuel prices skyrocket.
[00:29:56.711 --> 00:30:00.414]  Biden administration cancels Alaska oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:30:02.003 --> 00:30:02.263]  U.S.
[00:30:02.303 --> 00:30:09.389]  suffers under record inflation as draining strategic oil reserves offers only slight reprieve as we prepare to go into huge wars.
[00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:11.511]  Here's one of the polls.
[00:30:11.551 --> 00:30:17.115]  New poll finds 80% of likely voters are concerned about high gas prices under Biden and blame him, not the Russians.
[00:30:17.795 --> 00:30:21.839]  But that's okay, because what do they do to every time we talk about this?
[00:30:22.619 --> 00:30:23.840]  I see it all over Twitter and Instagram.
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:24.461]  People send it to me.
[00:30:25.541 --> 00:30:33.485]  I'll make comments about America being angry, and people being upset about open borders, and devaluation of currency, and exploding pedophilia, and the left just laughs.
[00:30:33.846 --> 00:30:38.948]  That's all they've got is their arrogant laughing in our face, as if that makes us feel belittled and powerless.
[00:30:39.309 --> 00:30:40.689]  No, it makes us hate you more!
[00:30:40.709 --> 00:30:44.932]  They got the video of this, but I can barely watch it.
[00:30:46.613 --> 00:30:54.237]  Biden's incoming press secretary laughs when asked who's handling baby formula crisis, and says there is no crisis.
[00:30:55.339 --> 00:30:56.039]  Let them eat cake.
[00:30:57.399 --> 00:31:03.899]   That's why there's a joke in the Babylon Bee, starving American babies disguise themselves as Ukrainian soldiers
[00:31:03.899 --> 00:31:07.399]  in hopes of getting $40 billion in federal aid.
[00:31:07.399 --> 00:31:17.399]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:31:16.806 --> 00:31:17.947]  drug overdose deaths passed 107,000 last year.
[00:31:18.047 --> 00:31:18.387]  Another record.
[00:31:22.199 --> 00:31:31.407]  But that's okay because Biden's screaming and yelling and blaming Republicans for food shortages when he's cutting off all the energy and the supplies.
[00:31:31.447 --> 00:31:35.530]  And again, Senator Kennedy says the Biden administration just keeps kicking its own ass.
[00:31:36.211 --> 00:31:39.914]  Nothing is built, nothing is back, and nothing is better.
[00:31:40.254 --> 00:31:45.658]  But you do nothing to stop them except say what an idiot Biden is.
[00:31:46.199 --> 00:31:47.340]  And then Biden comes out.
[00:31:50.362 --> 00:31:51.023]  We'll play the clip.
[00:31:52.645 --> 00:31:57.910]  Here in just a moment, and says Trump is the Make America Great Again King.
[00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:01.853]  Funny, he got elected, you didn't, buddy, with your 2,000 mules.
[00:32:03.434 --> 00:32:07.434]  So here is Biden projecting what he is on a Trump.
[00:32:07.434 --> 00:32:08.434]  [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[00:32:08.434 --> 00:32:09.434]  [MUSIC PLAYING]

[00:32:26.434 --> 00:32:27.434]  [END PLAYBACK]
[00:32:27.434 --> 00:32:30.434]   And again, the Democrats can't even get good audio of their speeches now.
[00:32:30.794 --> 00:32:36.598]  Everything they're doing is mismanagement and fraud and delusion.
[00:32:37.979 --> 00:32:39.780]  He goes on to say that the U.S.
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.022]  economy was on the brink of depression when he got in.
[00:32:42.282 --> 00:32:44.744]  No, it was doing pretty well and jobs were coming back.
[00:32:45.325 --> 00:32:45.845]  Incredible.
[00:32:46.025 --> 00:32:48.067]  Now, we've covered that.
[00:32:50.305 --> 00:32:51.906]  And just let that sink in real good.
[00:32:54.146 --> 00:33:04.410]  That he shut off more drilling for gas and oil and more leases while he tells you that it's the Republicans, the American people that did it.
[00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:06.711]  Oh, and Vladimir Putin.
[00:33:07.531 --> 00:33:07.971]  I forgot.
[00:33:09.072 --> 00:33:10.652]  Oh, oh, by the way, I have another article.
[00:33:10.672 --> 00:33:11.192]  They're in the news.
[00:33:11.212 --> 00:33:15.494]  The Democrats say Marjorie Taylor Greene for complaining about baby formula is a Russian agent.
[00:33:16.305 --> 00:33:16.605]  That's right.
[00:33:16.625 --> 00:33:23.847]  If you don't like there being no baby formula and skyrocketing prices, well, you are a Russian agent.
[00:33:24.047 --> 00:33:24.687]  Isn't that right?
[00:33:24.707 --> 00:33:30.488]  Of course, you didn't get 3.3 million from the mayor of Moscow like Biden did, but that's OK.
[00:33:30.508 --> 00:33:35.149]  Because, see, he gets to point his finger at you and talk about what he's done.
[00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:45.712]  When we come back, the massive FBI leak of them trying to surveil and indict prominent members of conservative journalism and more straight ahead.
[00:33:48.297 --> 00:33:50.979]  Charles Kamasi has thought a lot about this over a long time.
[00:33:51.019 --> 00:33:55.503]  He's the author of Losing Our Dignity, How Secularized Medicine is Undermining Fundamental Human Equality.
[00:33:55.523 --> 00:33:57.865]  He's also a professor at Creighton School of Medicine.
[00:33:57.905 --> 00:33:58.966]  He joins us tonight.
[00:33:58.986 --> 00:34:00.487]  Professor, thanks so much for coming.
[00:34:00.627 --> 00:34:03.570]  I know that you saw that you were the first person we thought of when we saw this piece.
[00:34:04.411 --> 00:34:05.832]  Are we overstating what's happening here?
[00:34:08.058 --> 00:34:12.262]  No, and first of all, thank you so much for covering it, Tucker, because it doesn't get a lot of coverage.
[00:34:12.902 --> 00:34:14.704]  And I think I have to wonder why.
[00:34:14.724 --> 00:34:17.487]  I mean, violence is something we hear covered ad nauseum.
[00:34:17.667 --> 00:34:20.729]  Everything today is violence, even things which obviously aren't violence.
[00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:21.450]  Yes.
[00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:22.331]  This is violence.
[00:34:22.351 --> 00:34:23.752]  This is medicalized violence.
[00:34:23.892 --> 00:34:25.193]  Why isn't this being covered?
[00:34:25.294 --> 00:34:26.555]  Why aren't we talking about it?
[00:34:26.675 --> 00:34:31.859]  Especially when it's poor people, especially when it's working class people who are structurally pushed into that.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.181]  I think that's a question worth asking.
[00:34:33.717 --> 00:34:44.082]  Well, sure, and there's this very difficult problem, which is, what do you do when an economy based on finance starts to go south and average people, you know, can't kind of sustain themselves?
[00:34:44.122 --> 00:34:45.963]  Do you do guaranteed basic income or whatever?
[00:34:46.463 --> 00:34:52.746]  This seems like an obvious choice for ghouls, neoliberal ghouls, like we'll just force poor people to kill themselves.
[00:34:54.946 --> 00:35:04.873]  And how many times have we heard from Canada about their healthcare system, their social care system, talking down to us about so many things, and now it's come home to roost.
[00:35:04.953 --> 00:35:07.255]  Canada's policies are seen for what they are.
[00:35:07.375 --> 00:35:09.316]  And we need, I mean, Canada has their own problems.
[00:35:09.376 --> 00:35:10.337]  We need to learn from this.
[00:35:10.397 --> 00:35:14.660]  We need to say, look, what's happening to our poor people, to our disabled people?
[00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:19.863]  The dementia population, Tucker, which we talked about in the early part of the pandemic, is set to double in the next 20 years.
[00:35:19.883 --> 00:35:21.324]  It's going to triple in the next 30 years.
[00:35:22.125 --> 00:35:22.645]  What are we going to do?
[00:35:22.685 --> 00:35:24.687]  Are we going to put the resources into care for them?
[00:35:25.167 --> 00:35:27.229]  If we don't, I really only see two options.
[00:35:27.449 --> 00:35:31.092]  So-called robot care, or straight-up no-chaser euthanasia.
[00:35:31.832 --> 00:35:32.053]  Yeah.
[00:35:32.413 --> 00:35:35.876]  So why don't politicians just say out loud now?
[00:35:35.896 --> 00:35:41.580]  I mean, so many things we're seeing now, we couldn't have imagined ten years ago, or five years ago even, and now they're commonplace.
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:42.120]  That's right.
[00:35:42.401 --> 00:35:44.042]  Killing yourself is not liberation.
[00:35:44.382 --> 00:35:45.083]  It's really sad.
[00:35:45.643 --> 00:35:46.744]  You shouldn't be forced to do it.
[00:35:46.904 --> 00:35:48.005]  Like, why does nobody say that?
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:54.922]  Well, your show is an example of giving people a voice who have no voice.
[00:35:54.942 --> 00:36:00.346]  The people who are most dramatically impacted by this, the working class and the poor, don't have a voice.
[00:36:00.606 --> 00:36:01.666]  And so we need to decide.
[00:36:01.846 --> 00:36:04.708]  And it's so interesting to see the political realignment underway.
[00:36:04.788 --> 00:36:11.492]  Which party is going to be the voice of the working class, the working and of the poor, to be on the side of people who say, I don't want to die.
[00:36:11.772 --> 00:36:14.714]  I don't want to die, but I don't see any option given what's been offered me.
[00:36:15.114 --> 00:36:16.055]  That's just diabolical.
[00:36:17.335 --> 00:36:18.716]  Diabolical is the word for it.
[00:36:18.736 --> 00:36:22.439]  You've been writing about this for so long, and I thank you for doing that.
[00:36:22.499 --> 00:36:23.840]  Professor, great to see you.
[00:36:25.581 --> 00:36:25.842]  Thank you.
[00:36:26.662 --> 00:36:32.326]  Mainstream news in Canada, in Europe, is promoting, basically forcing poor people to kill themselves.
[00:36:32.927 --> 00:36:40.973]  This is the same globalist eugenics, Build Back Better, Great Reset Party, that says they want you to take a shot because they want you to live longer and they love you so much.
[00:36:41.593 --> 00:36:45.496]  It is a surprise you found out the shot actually gives you Alzheimer's and heart failure.
[00:36:48.547 --> 00:36:51.268]  These people mean business, ladies and gentlemen, and it's here.
[00:36:51.328 --> 00:37:00.131]  They're going to cut the world resources off, and then force those of us that are productive to go along with the globalists to kill everybody off, or ourselves will starve to death.
[00:37:00.711 --> 00:37:02.952]  This is the sophisticated New World Order plan.
[00:37:02.972 --> 00:37:04.793]  It's what my film, Endgame, that I made.
[00:37:07.358 --> 00:37:14.264]  In 2007, 15 years ago, documents, it is the blueprint for global enslavement and extermination.
[00:37:14.704 --> 00:37:19.568]  I'm about to hit some really important news, obviously, about the internal police state and this incredible FBI leak.
[00:37:19.908 --> 00:37:25.233]  And I'm going to detail the calls for the impeachment of Joe Biden next hour and hit other news as well.
[00:37:25.313 --> 00:37:33.360]  But the wheels went into motion for this a year and a half ago, and they finally came in about a month ago.
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:42.945]  And we put a $300,000 investment down on this, and it's amazing, and it's here to fund our operation and to make your life better and safer.
[00:37:44.206 --> 00:37:58.455]  And that is made in America, patriot-owned, military-grade, means we can sell to the military, Faraday cages for small phones, big phones, iPads, laptops, and even big computers.
[00:37:59.135 --> 00:38:02.777]  This thing is up to big trash bag-sized systems, and it's 100%.
[00:38:04.278 --> 00:38:13.126]  Now, we've been selling for a long time, more than a decade, inexpensive Faraday cages that are about 95% effective, that last a while, but tear up pretty quick because they're inexpensive.
[00:38:13.426 --> 00:38:20.513]  We've sold probably 50,000 of these over the years, and these are still available, not made in America, at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:38:21.894 --> 00:38:25.718]  In green, red, black, and blue.
[00:38:27.737 --> 00:38:30.001]  And they fit small phones and medium-sized phones.
[00:38:30.021 --> 00:38:31.182]  That's the size that's available.
[00:38:31.343 --> 00:38:32.584]  And we still have those and they're great.
[00:38:33.025 --> 00:38:36.009]  But ladies and gentlemen, we went out to one of the top companies in the U.S.
[00:38:36.029 --> 00:38:36.711]  that supplies U.S.
[00:38:36.731 --> 00:38:42.840]  military, and we got them to come out with our own line of their product, cloned.
[00:38:44.508 --> 00:38:45.428]  And it is amazing.
[00:38:45.548 --> 00:38:46.469]  It is Redux.
[00:38:46.529 --> 00:38:53.272]  And it's an InfoWars brand, exclusively available at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[00:38:53.752 --> 00:38:57.654]  And we've got it in all different sizes.
[00:38:59.854 --> 00:39:00.675]  So, you want it?
[00:39:01.975 --> 00:39:02.456]  You got it.
[00:39:03.116 --> 00:39:07.157]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:39:07.798 --> 00:39:16.499]   From small phones that'll go in your back pocket, to systems that will hold I mean, you know, a couple desktops.
[00:39:17.899 --> 00:39:25.281]  And then you can travel around, do what you want, and not be surveilled by hackers, criminals, big corporations, and an out-of-control government.
[00:39:25.781 --> 00:39:29.522]  They are all available at InfoWarstore.com.
[00:39:29.542 --> 00:39:33.623]  We're gonna put banners up at the top of InfoWarstore.com.
[00:39:34.523 --> 00:39:38.971]   And I can tell you, That we're making about 55% on these.
[00:39:39.852 --> 00:39:45.979]  So we're not putting a big markup on these from what it cost us to produce these and make these.
[00:39:46.379 --> 00:39:48.262]  These are heavy duty.
[00:39:49.563 --> 00:39:50.544]  They are amazing.
[00:39:51.696 --> 00:39:53.358]  And they are what the military uses.
[00:39:54.058 --> 00:39:59.183]  I went to folks in Army Special Operations and I said, what does Delta Force use?
[00:39:59.784 --> 00:40:01.706]  And they said they use this brand.
[00:40:02.607 --> 00:40:04.769]  They use this organization.
[00:40:04.789 --> 00:40:05.509]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:07.251]  And that's what this is.
[00:40:08.012 --> 00:40:09.573]  This is what the Pentagon uses.
[00:40:10.294 --> 00:40:13.597]  This is the highest rated at a very, very low price comparatively.
[00:40:14.298 --> 00:40:15.259]  You can get something like this.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:19.082]  Made in China for 10% of the cost.
[00:40:19.102 --> 00:40:20.123]  And if you want to, go ahead.
[00:40:20.903 --> 00:40:25.587]  If you want to support the broadcast and American Patriots, the Redux brand is available.
[00:40:25.607 --> 00:40:28.189]  And they got a bunch of bags and a bunch of other stuff that's made overseas.
[00:40:28.669 --> 00:40:29.670]  You can't even have that made here.
[00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:31.691]  That's going to be added very, very soon as well.
[00:40:31.731 --> 00:40:33.452]  But this line is made in America.
[00:40:33.913 --> 00:40:37.495]  It's available as low as $19.95 at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:40:39.317 --> 00:40:39.837]  It's all there.
[00:40:39.897 --> 00:40:43.079]  Here's a little one minute promo we put together detailing it.
[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:43.440]  Here it is.
[00:40:43.939 --> 00:40:47.462]  We are now proud to release the Redux line of Faraday bags.
[00:40:47.802 --> 00:40:52.346]  This line features quick roll-down and Velcro seal closures with discreet branding.
[00:40:52.766 --> 00:40:59.471]  With six different sizes to choose from, they have a signature reduction solution for all of your electronic device needs.
[00:40:59.932 --> 00:41:07.718]  Redux specializes in quick-access weatherproof nylon Faraday bags with signal-blocking Faraday shielding technology.
[00:41:08.118 --> 00:41:19.702]  Specifically designed for electronic devices carried in unsecured locations to instantly block all wireless signals and protect them from remote wiping, tracking, and tampering.
[00:41:20.242 --> 00:41:28.125]   Redux is dedicated to producing and selling cost-effective signature reduction products Very proud of it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:28.145 --> 00:41:30.606]  It's going to have its own website soon.
[00:41:30.906 --> 00:41:34.628]  It's going to be launched, but we put a lot of money into this.
[00:41:34.648 --> 00:41:35.408]  $300,000 investment.
[00:41:35.268 --> 00:41:45.588]   cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, RFID, camera, EMP, weather, and even GPS today.
[00:41:45.588 --> 00:41:46.588]  Very proud of it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:46.588 --> 00:41:48.268]  It's going to have its own website soon.
[00:41:48.268 --> 00:41:54.188]   It's going to be launched, but we put a lot of money into this, $300,000 investment.
[00:41:54.188 --> 00:41:56.668]  It's here, and we're betting on you.
[00:41:56.668 --> 00:41:59.467]  We're betting on America, and it's got everything.
[00:41:59.408 --> 00:42:00.868]  And listen, this is for good people.
[00:42:01.909 --> 00:42:17.335]  But even the criminals in 2,000 mules that are caught going to the drop boxes, up to 10 or more a day, they weren't covering up their cell phones, so they got geolocated and tracked, and Dinesh D'Souza was able to buy that data from the app companies and the cellular providers.
[00:42:19.056 --> 00:42:25.873]   Everything the contact tracers, everything in the globalist new world order model of the future is going to be about You not having this.
[00:42:25.973 --> 00:42:28.834]  So, cell phones are powerful, but use it when you want to.
[00:42:29.835 --> 00:42:31.636]  Be tracked and located when you want to.
[00:42:31.656 --> 00:42:35.719]  Because even when you turn the location system off in your phone, they're still tracking you.
[00:42:35.739 --> 00:42:36.679]  That's come out in Congress.
[00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:54.465]   This is the only way, ladies and gentlemen, it funds the info war, it protects you and your family, the Redux line to lower your signature, Your electronic signature is now available exclusively at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:42:55.426 --> 00:42:57.027]  Protection the Faraday Way.
[00:42:57.067 --> 00:43:01.872]  Great job to the crew and our researchers and our military connections for getting us this.

[00:43:09.198 --> 00:43:19.117]   888-253-3139 and it took six months to get this manufactured.
[00:43:17.209 --> 00:43:19.251]  So this is the limited first-time run.
[00:43:19.271 --> 00:43:26.698]  I would imagine these will sell out in a week and then it'll be three months or longer because of supply chain breakdowns till we get more.
[00:43:26.738 --> 00:43:35.060]   We're going to take all the profit from that and put it into making even more stuff For our own brand and then expanding the products and the things that we have.
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:36.080]  But this is first rate.
[00:43:36.381 --> 00:43:37.181]  We're very proud of it.
[00:43:37.601 --> 00:43:38.502]  So 360 win.

[00:44:10.972 --> 00:44:12.972]  You see this?
[00:44:13.061 --> 00:44:22.828]  It's an InfoWars Republic Defense Card with original InfoWars art designed by yours truly with a little gold bar implanted in it and on the back it's got a hologram.
[00:44:23.329 --> 00:44:27.352]  There are only 25,000 of these in existence and they'll never be made again.
[00:44:28.132 --> 00:44:38.117]  The bank that owns the Mint that has started putting these out the last few years just sold out of 300,000 of a similar offering that was 40% more than what we're selling these for.
[00:44:38.457 --> 00:44:42.379]  And when you get three or more, you can get these at 50% off and they fund the InfoWare.

[00:45:04.633 --> 00:45:05.534]  We are the tip of the spear.
[00:45:05.814 --> 00:45:06.574]  You are the tip of the spear.
[00:45:06.815 --> 00:45:07.835]  And I salute you and thank you.
[00:45:08.116 --> 00:45:09.757]  Visit MFullWorkstore.com today.
[00:45:11.363 --> 00:45:26.290]  Attorney generals from 20 conservative states are threatening legal action against the Department of Homeland Security's newly formed Disinformation Governance Board, which they said will have a chilling effect on freedom of expression, and described it as un-American.
[00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:29.232]  Unconstitutional would be the word I would use.
[00:45:29.492 --> 00:45:39.937]  Now, the good news is, is that almost all the big tech platforms now acknowledge some responsibility for content on their platforms, and they're investing in large teams of people to monitor it.
[00:45:40.157 --> 00:45:48.003]   While content moderation can limit the distribution of clearly dangerous content, It doesn't go far enough.
[00:45:48.184 --> 00:45:54.206]  This MAGA crowd is really the most extreme political organization that's existed in American history.
[00:45:54.746 --> 00:46:14.555]  If it were that simple, it would merely be irony that the Biden administration, led by its chronic serial fabricator-in-chief, is just gonna bypass that worthless old First Amendment and set up an Orwellian ministry of truth led by esteemed disinformation regurgitator Nina Jankowicz.
[00:46:14.815 --> 00:46:39.071]  So what I'm encouraging individuals to do, in particular, just your normal, average, everyday citizen, is to practice informational distancing, where recognizing that disinformation and misinformation often run on emotional manipulation, when you feel your emotions rising, to just walk away from your device for a little bit, let yourself cool down, and then start to consider the source.
[00:46:39.512 --> 00:46:44.575]  Why does that particular source have an interest in emotionally manipulating you?
[00:46:45.375 --> 00:46:48.577]  We're going to begin tonight with that alleged terror plot and the chilling plan.
[00:46:48.617 --> 00:46:51.739]  The FBI says it stopped before it could be carried out.
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:56.702]  A plan to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and then what they were planning to do to her.
[00:46:57.343 --> 00:47:02.146]  Thirteen suspects arrested including seven alleged members of a right-wing militia group.
[00:47:02.446 --> 00:47:12.932]  The local four defenders first told you the men charged in the plot to kidnap Governor Whitmer say the men who trained them the entire time were undercover FBI agents.
[00:47:13.012 --> 00:47:28.000]  Now, a new court filing obtained by the defenders, filed by so-called ringleader Adam Fox, says paid FBI informants were also the ones to come up with the plan to kidnap the governor and attack her summer home.
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:38.655]  Jenkiewicz has praised the debunked dossier author Christopher Steele and vehemently claimed that the Hunter Biden laptop story was Russian disinformation.
[00:47:38.715 --> 00:47:44.394]   But Jankowicz's manic zealotry is far more complicated than what appears on the surface.
[00:47:44.394 --> 00:47:47.035]  Who do I f**k to be famous?
[00:47:47.035 --> 00:47:52.715]  I've done everything I can and now the rest is up to you.
[00:47:52.715 --> 00:47:58.875]   Jankowicz's resume reads like a quintessential job application to the Biden Ukrainian Corruption
[00:47:58.875 --> 00:48:04.795]   Corporation, an organization hell-bent on New World Order Russia regime change,
[00:48:04.795 --> 00:48:07.835]  fueled by the fleecing of the American taxpayer.
[00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:11.432]  In 2010, Jankiewicz attended a university in Russia.
[00:48:11.772 --> 00:48:18.276]  In 2017, she was a Fulbright Fellow in Kiev, working alongside the Foreign Ministry of Ukraine.
[00:48:18.596 --> 00:48:31.063]  She has also served as a Disinformation Fellow at the treasonous Woodrow Wilson Center, and as supervisor of the Russia and Belarus programs at the National Democratic Institute.
[00:48:31.323 --> 00:48:39.932]  Republicans are criticizing your decision, the administration's decision, to choose Nina Jankowicz to lead this disinformation board.
[00:48:39.972 --> 00:48:42.394]  They say she is not somebody who is neutral.
[00:48:42.815 --> 00:48:43.375]  Your response?
[00:48:43.856 --> 00:48:44.917]  Eminently qualified.
[00:48:44.937 --> 00:48:48.420]  A renowned expert in the field of disinformation.
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:49.081]  And neutral?
[00:48:49.101 --> 00:48:49.822]  Absolutely so.
[00:48:50.816 --> 00:48:52.818]  Honouring is really quite ferocious.
[00:48:52.898 --> 00:48:58.563]  It's when a huckster takes some lies and makes them sound precocious by selling them in Congress or a mainstream outlet.
[00:48:58.583 --> 00:49:02.306]  So, disinformation's origins are slightly less atrocious.
[00:49:02.526 --> 00:49:08.672]  When the department picked her, was the department aware of her TikTok videos?
[00:49:10.391 --> 00:49:13.953]  Senator, I... They're really quite precocious.
[00:49:15.214 --> 00:49:20.697]  Senator, I was not aware of those videos.
[00:49:20.978 --> 00:49:28.722]  And as the multi-millionaire Wall Street leeching Democratic Party eggs on World War III and funnels in billions of U.S.
[00:49:28.762 --> 00:49:33.905]   taxpayer dollars to one of the most corrupt countries on Earth, Ukraine.
[00:49:34.286 --> 00:49:37.448]  Corruption blatantly tied to the Biden family.
[00:49:37.728 --> 00:49:43.913]  Jankiewicz fronts an effort mirroring the totalitarianism being wielded on Ukrainian dissenters.
[00:49:44.213 --> 00:49:49.356]  An effort that would make the Ukrainian Goebbels-worshipping Azov battalion very proud.
[00:49:49.717 --> 00:49:53.459]  Ask yourself, what is the endgame for a ministry of truth?
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:54.520]  No, don't do that.
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:55.681]  Your door is being kicked in.
[00:49:56.041 --> 00:49:57.122]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:49:59.409 --> 00:50:03.670]  We've got to push for the impeachment of the entire criminal Biden administration.
[00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:07.251]  I'll lay out the evidence on the other side of this 60-second break.
[00:50:07.591 --> 00:50:08.252]  Please stay with us.
[00:50:08.332 --> 00:50:09.552]  Everybody you know, tune in now.
[00:50:12.773 --> 00:50:18.134]  It's Thursday, May 12, 2022, and we're into hour number two.
[00:50:18.655 --> 00:50:20.655]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:50:20.655 --> 00:50:34.655]  To bring down a system, you have to undermine it.
[00:50:34.655 --> 00:50:44.655]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:50:37.094 --> 00:50:37.914]  You have to collapse it.
[00:50:40.776 --> 00:50:42.397]  So you can build your new system.
[00:50:44.498 --> 00:50:50.581]  And if you think the collapse of this system is going to be hellish, well then you haven't studied the New World Orders in-game.
[00:50:51.962 --> 00:50:58.526]  Because we're going to look back on the organized, engineered planetary collapse that leads us to the year 2030 in their agenda.
[00:51:02.017 --> 00:51:04.098]  And you're going to look back on this as a cakewalk.
[00:51:06.299 --> 00:51:08.940]  That's why it's very important to try to stop this as best we can now.
[00:51:09.781 --> 00:51:12.582]  And that's putting it very, very mildly.
[00:51:14.283 --> 00:51:14.603]  All right.
[00:51:16.083 --> 00:51:34.820]   We need to pressure the Republican Party to move for articles in impeachment And to have the hundreds of Republican members of the House and the 47 members, 48 members of the Senate.
[00:51:36.513 --> 00:51:47.658]  To get up and to give speeches exposing the crimes and the deliberate sabotage of the infrastructure and energy and food production of the United States.
[00:51:48.058 --> 00:51:59.104]  And they have all the admissions, they can play the clips, they can show the big blow-up articles where Biden and his controllers say they're doing this to get us off carbon in a transition.
[00:51:59.144 --> 00:52:03.946]  His energy secretary, his transportation secretary, they're all on record.
[00:52:05.492 --> 00:52:26.580]  It's not just the right thing to do, it is a political supercharger so that Democrats have to come out in favor of no baby formula, in favor of $6 a gallon gas, in favor of devalued massive 11% inflation, in favor of open borders, in favor of their whole agenda.
[00:52:27.932 --> 00:52:36.096]  The Republicans spend all their time going, we're not Russians, and you've been proven to lie on that dossier, and we're not... Everybody knows you're not Russians.
[00:52:37.597 --> 00:52:40.318]  Eighty-something percent of Americans don't want a war in Ukraine.
[00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:47.322]  So stop obsessing on what the people don't care about.
[00:52:48.171 --> 00:52:50.832]  They care about no baby formula and $6 a gallon gas.
[00:52:51.212 --> 00:52:52.632]  They care about collapsing borders.
[00:52:52.652 --> 00:52:53.532]  They care about crime.
[00:52:53.792 --> 00:52:55.053]  They care about defunding the police.
[00:52:55.253 --> 00:52:56.533]  They care about critical race theory.
[00:52:56.793 --> 00:52:58.834]  They care about drag queen pedophile story time.
[00:53:02.014 --> 00:53:13.417]  And we have a big enough audience and are influential enough, and I guarantee you'll start seeing this the next days and weeks, if you call into their talk radio shows and if you share this live show today in the archive of it later for Man.Video where we lay this out.
[00:53:15.802 --> 00:53:17.243]  You will see action in Congress.
[00:53:17.383 --> 00:53:25.327]  You know, back when the Democrats didn't even have a majority, they tried to impeach Trump for things he didn't do because they knew it was a way to politically wound him.
[00:53:26.088 --> 00:53:28.749]  And they did it again when they had the majority, but didn't take it to the Senate.
[00:53:29.429 --> 00:53:32.311]  They just impeached him, didn't convict him, because they knew they didn't have the evidence.
[00:53:33.885 --> 00:53:37.907]  But we have the evidence and we have it out of their own mouths.
[00:53:38.327 --> 00:53:52.032]  I could sit there with Senate investigators or House investigators in an hour and give them dozens of clips of Democrat operatives saying they're turning the power off as part of a global Davos Group Great Reset Build Back Better program to get rid of fossil fuels.
[00:53:53.732 --> 00:54:03.535]  And I likened it last hour to we got this good ship in the middle of dangerous high seas that we're all on, and the deep state says, we're going to sink that ship for the environment.
[00:54:04.055 --> 00:54:08.056]  You can get in this new ship, and you look over the side of the ship, there is no ship.
[00:54:08.256 --> 00:54:09.897]  There's freezing 30-foot swells.
[00:54:11.758 --> 00:54:12.958]  There's nothing there but death.
[00:54:13.918 --> 00:54:15.179]  They never meant to replace it.
[00:54:15.399 --> 00:54:16.539]  They never meant to upgrade it.
[00:54:16.999 --> 00:54:22.721]  They've been blocking all the new technologies, and only giving us boondoggles that don't work, that enrich themselves with money laundering.
[00:54:25.942 --> 00:54:28.003]  And people say, well, we'll just get Harris.
[00:54:28.063 --> 00:54:29.724]  Well, we'll just get Pelosi.
[00:54:29.744 --> 00:54:33.145]  Well, we'll impeach them too, one after the other.
[00:54:34.105 --> 00:54:35.446]  Let's get this party started.
[00:54:36.786 --> 00:54:41.028]  Well, Republicans are going to win big in 180 days.
[00:54:42.729 --> 00:54:49.652]  And then the Kevin McCarthy's and the Mitch McConnell's will sit there and preside over deals that continue America on its path to globalism.
[00:54:49.952 --> 00:54:52.873]  Their rhetoric just won't be as cheerleading.
[00:54:53.959 --> 00:54:55.800]  of these events as the Democrats' is.
[00:54:58.721 --> 00:54:59.681]  I agree with Roger Stone.
[00:54:59.841 --> 00:55:09.745]  We need a cadre of new pro-America populist cut from the same piece of cloth as MTG and Matt Gaetz and other embattled members of Congress.
[00:55:10.105 --> 00:55:11.706]  And Gozer and the rest of them.
[00:55:13.026 --> 00:55:14.067]  And Jim Jordan and others.
[00:55:17.468 --> 00:55:21.369]  That'll be a key voting block to force through a lot of important things and get a lot of things done.
[00:55:21.429 --> 00:55:22.230]  That's step one.
[00:55:23.151 --> 00:55:34.561]  But the bigger thing that nobody's talking about, and that is not being pushed anywhere, is that we can't play politics with this and go, boy, Biden sure hurting the Democrats.
[00:55:36.283 --> 00:55:40.527]  Let's just let him sit there and, in fact, get the clip of Senator Kennedy ready.
[00:55:40.547 --> 00:55:41.067]  We got it here.
[00:55:41.788 --> 00:55:46.852]  Clip eight, clip nine, where he says the Biden administration just keeps kicking its own ass.
[00:55:46.912 --> 00:55:48.334]  No, they're kicking our ass.
[00:55:49.750 --> 00:56:02.496]  Suicide, drug overdose, crime, murder, carjacking, bankruptcy, insolvency, massive inflation, food shortages.
[00:56:02.516 --> 00:56:06.058]  Everything I told you two years ago was coming because it was in their plan.
[00:56:06.398 --> 00:56:14.122]  I harped and harped and harped and harped and harped until people told me, we're sick of hearing about when the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[00:56:14.462 --> 00:56:15.203]  Well, now we're there.
[00:56:16.463 --> 00:56:17.484]  Now people want to talk about it.
[00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:22.381]  Of course, because it's too late now, but we can mitigate it.
[00:56:24.322 --> 00:56:26.823]  So it isn't a question of, should we do this?
[00:56:28.624 --> 00:56:29.684]  We need Joe Rogan.
[00:56:29.744 --> 00:56:30.865]  We need Tucker Carlson.
[00:56:31.205 --> 00:56:31.925]  And I'm sure they will.
[00:56:32.305 --> 00:56:39.568]  And we need everybody else, including you, to start beating the drum of impeachment.
[00:56:39.608 --> 00:56:41.549]  And the Republican leadership will try to do it.
[00:56:44.056 --> 00:56:47.237]  For Hunter Biden's laptop, or for foreign money or something.
[00:56:47.277 --> 00:56:48.458]  That's side issues.
[00:56:48.578 --> 00:56:50.879]  People get there's no baby formula.
[00:56:50.899 --> 00:56:52.619]  They get $5, $6 a gallon gas.
[00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:54.400]  They get their power bill doubling.
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:56.381]  They get there not being food on the shelves.
[00:56:56.421 --> 00:57:00.483]  They get being mugged, or carjacked, or their daughter raped, or their son stabbed.
[00:57:00.823 --> 00:57:04.564]  They get illegals standing on every street corner with no jobs and future.
[00:57:04.904 --> 00:57:07.005]  They get drag queen pedophile story time.
[00:57:07.265 --> 00:57:11.007]  They get the whole New World Order, Build Back Better agenda.
[00:57:11.932 --> 00:57:40.107]   And so for sabotaging the economy, for cutting off the gas pipelines, the oil pipelines, for shutting off the new leases, for shutting off drilling in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico and killing the Keystone Pipeline and all the rest of it, and draining the strategic oil reserves, and then buying the oil from Venezuela, we Have to take action on the rolling blackouts and the rest of the collapse.
[00:57:40.127 --> 00:57:40.507]  The U.S.
[00:57:40.527 --> 00:57:41.247]  will only accelerate.
[00:57:41.408 --> 00:57:43.869]  This is part of a plan to bring us to our knees.
[00:57:44.029 --> 00:57:48.613]  I don't think anybody disagrees with me on what I just said.
[00:57:48.753 --> 00:57:58.160]  So the last thing they want is you to peacefully go to Congress and knock on your congressman or women's door and go in there and talk to them or go to their meet and greets locally.
[00:57:59.122 --> 00:58:00.403]  Or call in to talk radio.
[00:58:00.843 --> 00:58:01.603]  Or send an email.
[00:58:02.103 --> 00:58:08.867]  Or take the archive of this live show today, once it's archived, at Man.Video, and share the daylights out of it.
[00:58:10.367 --> 00:58:19.452]  Or our review yesterday of 2,000 Mules, it was very powerful, that I'm gonna give a headline to and post on InfoWars.com here in the next hour.
[00:58:21.453 --> 00:58:22.433]  This is imperative.
[00:58:22.453 --> 00:58:23.173]  You want victory?
[00:58:23.213 --> 00:58:23.994]  You want success?
[00:58:24.714 --> 00:58:26.475]  We politically have them.
[00:58:27.472 --> 00:58:32.985]  See, the Republican leadership doesn't want people to impeach folks over economics and over inflation.
[00:58:33.266 --> 00:58:36.092]  They want to keep it political, just like they did with...
[00:58:38.683 --> 00:58:47.311]  The Clintons, where they made it about travel futures and the Rose Law Firm, or did Clinton get a blowjob or didn't he?
[00:58:47.451 --> 00:58:57.260]  Because they could isolate it down to that one little story and not make it about the Republican leadership that was going along with selling out all our missile secrets to the Chinese at the time in the mid-1990s.
[00:58:58.041 --> 00:59:01.344]  So that's why they want to compartmentalize things down to Hunter Biden's laptop.
[00:59:03.487 --> 00:59:21.236]  Or into abortion, which I think we should restrict to get rid of, but I'm saying they're using it as a football right now, no one can deny that, and not let them distract us with that, and realize we need to get populist Christians elected and take the government over legally and lawfully and put the brakes to everything that's happening as we go over an edge of a cliff.
[00:59:21.256 --> 00:59:22.116]  So here's the bottom line.
[00:59:23.557 --> 00:59:48.377]   All these Republicans using distractions and eating around the edges of censorship and surveillance and The re-education system with the Ministry of Truth, that is good cannon fodder, it's good red meat, but it's not the central issue of the energy being cut off, and the border being collapsed by design, and the end of Title 42, and allowing human smuggling to happen.
[00:59:48.597 --> 00:59:53.540]  So we need articles of impeachment on the economy, on inflation, on cutting off the energy, and on the border.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:57.783]  That will sink him, everyone will unify behind it, and we will take the country back!
[00:59:58.243 --> 00:59:59.244]  Those are the issues!
[00:59:59.986 --> 01:00:02.607]  I know I'm yelling because this is damn serious.
[01:00:03.247 --> 01:00:04.528]  We'll be right back to talk about it more.
[01:00:05.128 --> 01:00:05.508]  Stay with us.
[01:00:06.589 --> 01:00:08.349]  All right, my friends, here's what I want to do.
[01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:17.153]  We have a special guest joining us with all the massive new COVID developments that are so critical to stopping the next lockdown and bringing these criminals to justice, Dr. Fleming, next hour.
[01:00:17.193 --> 01:00:23.596]  But I want to take six, seven, eight phone calls specifically on impeaching Joe Biden.
[01:00:24.898 --> 01:00:27.060]  And your ideas on it and what you think of what I've said here.
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:39.149]  So I'm going to give the number out, first six, seven, eight callers that get through, we'll put those on there, and we'll take those calls that are on the board, no more than those, because I don't want to keep people sitting there on hold.
[01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:44.233]  And yes, people ask, Alex, why do you rant and rave?
[01:00:44.293 --> 01:00:45.294]  Well, I mean, I'm pissed off.
[01:00:47.236 --> 01:00:56.605]  If I went to a football game and yelled and screamed during different plays, people would think that was completely normal if I painted my face up and hyperventilated over a football game that does not matter.
[01:00:58.247 --> 01:01:06.675]   But when we are watching the country by design be shut down, And we know what comes next, and it's life and death.
[01:01:07.475 --> 01:01:11.016]  I'll do anything I need to to get people motivated and get them to awaken.
[01:01:11.296 --> 01:01:13.317]  But listen, I'm not having to make myself get angry.
[01:01:13.817 --> 01:01:17.798]  I'm legitimately yelling and screaming because I don't know what else to do.
[01:01:18.559 --> 01:01:25.401]  You know, I was talking in the first hour of you just joined us about the fact that I talked and belabored.
[01:01:29.682 --> 01:01:32.083]  It ad nauseam last year.
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:37.763]  That this is a design collapse, and that we would have food shortages.
[01:01:39.185 --> 01:01:46.732]  And I got up here on air, and I told people, you better get ready, this is a plan.
[01:01:48.153 --> 01:01:50.115]  Now I also told you what comes next after that.
[01:01:50.536 --> 01:01:58.864]  War, cyber attacks, power outages, race wars, martial law, mass arrest, gun confiscation, total destruction.
[01:02:00.728 --> 01:02:05.111]  Because they've been wargaming that, and they've been preparing that, and the CIA has been admitting that.
[01:02:07.233 --> 01:02:09.694]  So I'm sorry that the news is scary.
[01:02:09.794 --> 01:02:11.596]  I'm sorry it's horrifying.
[01:02:12.696 --> 01:02:16.939]  I'm not going to sit up here and go, oh, look at what a bunch of idiots the Democrats are.
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:18.961]  Oh, we're kicking their butts.
[01:02:19.001 --> 01:02:20.182]  They're kicking their own ass.
[01:02:20.522 --> 01:02:21.202]  Ha ha ha!
[01:02:21.403 --> 01:02:22.363]  It's so funny!
[01:02:22.684 --> 01:02:24.064]  And listeners would love that.
[01:02:24.445 --> 01:02:25.986]  It'd be a popular show.
[01:02:28.488 --> 01:02:30.089]  These are the evil puppets.
[01:02:31.348 --> 01:02:36.813]  These are the clowns that the controllers put in to take the blame.
[01:02:38.655 --> 01:02:41.297]  So them looking like idiots doesn't mean anything.
[01:02:42.598 --> 01:02:52.848]  Because all they are, are functionaries and ceremonial placeholders of the globalists ruining my life and ruining your life and killing hundreds of millions of people with starvation.
[01:02:53.888 --> 01:02:56.089]  And if we don't do something about it, it's on us.
[01:02:56.769 --> 01:02:59.971]  So I want to hear specifically from callers on this topic.
[01:03:00.211 --> 01:03:00.871]  Do you agree with me?
[01:03:00.891 --> 01:03:01.551]  Do you disagree?
[01:03:01.811 --> 01:03:02.952]  And what are you going to do?
[01:03:03.012 --> 01:03:09.775]  What should I do to push this out there and make Republicans know we hold you just as responsible?
[01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:15.738]  Not just for the censorship and not just for the surveillance and not the big things that everybody agrees on.
[01:03:16.038 --> 01:03:17.298]  Totally open borders.
[01:03:17.638 --> 01:03:19.219]  Human trafficking by the millions.
[01:03:19.859 --> 01:03:20.880]  Kidnapped children.
[01:03:22.381 --> 01:03:27.743]  Inflation and cutting the pipelines and oil drilling off that is causing this.
[01:03:28.484 --> 01:03:39.328]  They are doing it directly with executive action, haul his ass in there, indict him in the House, try his ugly ass in the Senate, and throw his ass out on the street!
[01:03:40.909 --> 01:03:41.289]  Dammit!
[01:03:42.149 --> 01:03:43.390]  Excuse me, I'm not trying to get...
[01:03:44.318 --> 01:03:44.778]  You know what?
[01:03:46.219 --> 01:03:48.579]  Listen, we are not going to let them do this anymore.
[01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:49.920]  It cannot stand.
[01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:51.641]  It cannot be allowed to do this.
[01:03:52.421 --> 01:04:10.007]  I got stacks of articles here from the new FBI whistleblower all confirmed how they spy on the media and are trying to indict all the Republican and conservative leaders and the people in the media and how they were spying and are spying and labeling you as domestic terrorist if you protest critical race theory and drag queen story time.
[01:04:11.564 --> 01:04:20.487]  That's treason, that's evil, that's wrong, that's third world, that's North Korea, that's cancer, that's despicable and illegal and must stop!
[01:04:24.068 --> 01:04:26.989]  They think doing all this will make us roll over in fear.
[01:04:27.189 --> 01:04:27.849]  You know what?
[01:04:28.569 --> 01:04:29.129]  I already did.
[01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:34.271]  I'm way more scared of letting them win and totally take over than what happens to me individually.
[01:04:36.118 --> 01:04:38.580]  The globalists will always threaten us publicly and privately.
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:40.361]  Oh, you know we can do this, we can do that.
[01:04:40.401 --> 01:04:42.562]  What, you don't think I don't know you're evil?
[01:04:43.103 --> 01:04:44.504]  You don't think I don't know?
[01:04:44.524 --> 01:04:48.026]  Oh, you think I'm doing all this because I think I'm invincible?
[01:04:48.406 --> 01:04:49.487]  And I'm a narcissist?
[01:04:49.747 --> 01:04:51.368]  And I'm arrogant like you people?
[01:04:51.628 --> 01:04:52.349]  I'm not arrogant!
[01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:54.490]  I'm not on a power trip!
[01:04:55.271 --> 01:04:57.372]  This isn't confidence, this is desperation.
[01:04:57.892 --> 01:04:58.633]  This is duty.
[01:04:58.873 --> 01:05:01.275]  This is what I've got to do, and it's what I will do.
[01:05:02.657 --> 01:05:05.680]  But hey, none of you got much longer to wait now.
[01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:06.881]  You think war is bad?
[01:05:07.101 --> 01:05:08.223]  You think open borders is bad?
[01:05:08.443 --> 01:05:10.285]  You think 11% inflation is bad a year?
[01:05:11.005 --> 01:05:12.367]  You haven't seen anything yet.
[01:05:12.687 --> 01:05:16.671]  You will wake up, and you will stand up.
[01:05:17.092 --> 01:05:19.114]  The question is, will it be when it's too late?
[01:05:20.441 --> 01:05:26.903]  Total free number to join is 877-789-2539.
[01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:28.263]  877-789-2539.
[01:05:28.283 --> 01:05:28.643]  877-789-Alex.
[01:05:28.943 --> 01:05:29.684]  Oh, and one more thing.
[01:05:29.904 --> 01:05:30.584]  First-time callers.
[01:05:31.124 --> 01:05:32.164]  Let's do some first-time callers.
[01:05:32.585 --> 01:05:34.185]  First-time callers, your chance to call in.
[01:05:34.225 --> 01:05:37.066]  I'd love to hear from you.
[01:05:37.086 --> 01:05:37.286]  877-789-2539.
[01:05:37.706 --> 01:05:42.527]  Please, regular listeners, we love you to death, but give new listeners a chance to chime in and be involved in the broadcast.
[01:05:43.248 --> 01:05:44.768]  We got a good chance of beating this, folks.
[01:05:45.648 --> 01:05:47.649]  But this is not business as usual.
[01:05:49.315 --> 01:05:55.677]  So I mentioned how in the first hour, thousands of times I said food shortages, collapse, third world collapsing, flooding us.
[01:05:56.017 --> 01:05:57.977]  I said we should get the archivist to dig through and show that.
[01:05:58.458 --> 01:06:04.739]  I guess there was already a video from May 12th of this year, going back over two years, when the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:07.160]  It's on Band.Video.
[01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:11.781]  I'll have this added under the live show feed today, dealing with all this.
[01:06:12.822 --> 01:06:18.659]   If you look at the live show feed today, We explained that the impeachment of Joe Biden must start.
[01:06:19.119 --> 01:06:20.739]  It must be done now.
[01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:22.800]  It won't make him politically stronger.
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:24.660]  It won't make people rally around him.
[01:06:24.921 --> 01:06:34.363]  It'll make America unified behind the fact that we know they are deliberately sabotaging our economy every way they can and that it must stop.
[01:06:35.043 --> 01:06:37.704]  You will reopen the drilling in Alaska.
[01:06:37.764 --> 01:06:39.444]  You will reopen the Keystone Pipeline.
[01:06:39.824 --> 01:06:44.866]  You will reopen those thousands and thousands of leases and other spurs of delivery systems.
[01:06:45.714 --> 01:06:46.355]  You will do it!
[01:06:47.596 --> 01:06:49.058]  You will open the gas pipelines.
[01:06:49.078 --> 01:06:50.840]  You will open the oil pipelines.
[01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:51.660]  You will do it.
[01:06:51.921 --> 01:06:55.505]  Do you understand, you miserable piece of filth, Joe Biden?
[01:07:00.461 --> 01:07:02.582]  Try not to blow up here, but these people are, this is war!
[01:07:02.862 --> 01:07:12.144]  We have them attacking us economically, culturally, attacking us with fentanyl, attacking us with Hollywood Evil, and we've got to stand up and say, we are done!
[01:07:12.724 --> 01:07:13.905]  We are through!
[01:07:14.425 --> 01:07:17.846]  We are not gonna go along with this anymore!
[01:07:20.647 --> 01:07:29.613]   We're gonna come back and I'm gonna calmly take your phone calls and go over more evidence of this, but this, if this doesn't Get you to commit to take action legally and lawfully and peacefully.
[01:07:30.273 --> 01:07:33.735]  While you're being assaulted, then you deserve what's happening to you.
[01:07:33.775 --> 01:07:38.517]  They're watching to see if they can get away with it, folks, and right now they are, just rubbing your face in it.
[01:07:39.237 --> 01:07:42.739]  Trying to bankrupt you and your economy to take full control of you and your life.
[01:07:44.079 --> 01:07:46.680]  And we are back, taking your phone calls right now.
[01:07:47.301 --> 01:07:52.083]  Let's put the full show headline up there from InfoWars.com that says it all.
[01:07:53.615 --> 01:07:55.158]  We need all hands on deck.
[01:07:55.198 --> 01:08:04.394]  We need all Americans to, in one voice, say we want Biden impeached for deliberately cutting off the energy system and violating federal law and dissolving the southern border.
[01:08:05.322 --> 01:08:07.524]  That's the unifier and that's critical to the country.
[01:08:08.024 --> 01:08:11.147]  Hunter, laptops, all that crap is side issues, okay?
[01:08:11.647 --> 01:08:14.629]  Those are political footballs, the Durham investigation is going nowhere.
[01:08:15.110 --> 01:08:23.656]  Thursday live, Republicans must file articles of impeachment against Biden for cutting off America's energy and obliterating our southern border.
[01:08:24.117 --> 01:08:26.419]  Or, they themselves are guilty of treason.
[01:08:27.199 --> 01:08:27.720]  Period.
[01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:31.382]  No baby formula, $40 billion for Ukraine.
[01:08:31.883 --> 01:08:32.984]  Two hours to read the bill.
[01:08:35.057 --> 01:08:35.597]  On Tuesday.
[01:08:37.299 --> 01:08:51.110]  It's a pack of criminals up there, but you force Republicans to show that they're not for controlling the border, and that they're not for stopping inflation, and they're not for turning back on the gas and fuel drilling and pipelines.
[01:08:52.352 --> 01:08:53.333]  This is strategic.
[01:08:53.513 --> 01:08:55.194]  This is the heart of the nation.
[01:08:55.594 --> 01:08:56.815]  They already de-industrialized us.
[01:08:56.855 --> 01:08:58.076]  Now they're taking our energy away.
[01:08:58.376 --> 01:08:59.277]  Now they're spying on us.
[01:08:59.537 --> 01:09:01.519]  Now they're censoring us and taking our speech away.
[01:09:01.759 --> 01:09:06.843]  And then they're coming for our guns and our children with critical race theory and the transgender garbage and all of it.
[01:09:07.083 --> 01:09:11.786]  And we have to say our Declaration of Independence is today, May 12, 2022.
[01:09:12.647 --> 01:09:13.407]  We say no.
[01:09:13.668 --> 01:09:15.809]  And we say, listen up, Republicans.
[01:09:16.690 --> 01:09:17.671]  You start the impeachment.
[01:09:17.751 --> 01:09:20.413]  All we need is good members like MTG.
[01:09:21.644 --> 01:09:33.127]  And Gozer and Jordan and others to start filing their own articles that have this in it and it will gain momentum just like when Green out of Texas would file stuff on Trump.
[01:09:33.407 --> 01:09:37.167]  Except here, they would always stop at the Senate because they didn't have any evidence for the trial.
[01:09:37.648 --> 01:09:42.909]  We won't just indict Biden in the House.
[01:09:42.989 --> 01:09:44.889]  We will convict him in the Senate.
[01:09:45.289 --> 01:09:47.870]  People say, well we don't have the votes.
[01:09:49.363 --> 01:09:51.364]  Basically, Manchin would go with it.
[01:09:51.944 --> 01:09:54.245]  It's 50-50 in the Senate, and it doesn't matter.
[01:09:54.305 --> 01:09:58.267]  It'll politically force these issues out and get us on the offense.
[01:09:59.127 --> 01:10:04.589]  So I don't want to hear it from Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy and all those other pieces of filth.
[01:10:04.609 --> 01:10:07.851]  All right, we're going to go to your phone calls right now.
[01:10:10.196 --> 01:10:12.838]  We're gonna go to James in Oregon.
[01:10:12.898 --> 01:10:15.919]  James on the impeachment of O'Biden.
[01:10:15.939 --> 01:10:19.201]  The impeachment of Obama's third term.
[01:10:19.241 --> 01:10:21.523]  Go ahead.
[01:10:22.123 --> 01:10:22.303]  Hello.
[01:10:22.483 --> 01:10:23.684]  Thank you for letting me on, Alex.
[01:10:24.664 --> 01:10:26.546]  I love you personally and I hope you the best.
[01:10:26.826 --> 01:10:27.866]  Thank you.
[01:10:28.747 --> 01:10:40.857]   I believe that you should present clips that are under 20 megabytes so that we can get recorded evidence Uh, to the Patriots so that they can send them to their communities and their councils.
[01:10:41.632 --> 01:10:47.032]   and everyone else who they can with fine stamps of where they're from so that we can hold
[01:10:47.032 --> 01:10:48.032]  them accountable.
[01:10:48.032 --> 01:10:49.032]  No, you're right.
[01:10:49.032 --> 01:10:52.912]   We should put together some two, three, four minute videos showing them giggling how they're
[01:10:52.912 --> 01:10:56.632]   cutting the energy off, showing them brag how they would do it, and now how they're
[01:10:56.632 --> 01:11:03.712]   doing it, and now how there's massive inflation, massive shortages, massive energy price increases,
[01:11:03.712 --> 01:11:08.112]   massive rolling blackouts, baby formula shortages, everything else.
[01:11:08.112 --> 01:11:09.872]  And it's only going to get worse in the next few years.
[01:11:09.872 --> 01:11:12.992]  So we're going to do this now or do this later.
[01:11:12.992 --> 01:11:14.391]  Yes.
[01:11:14.391 --> 01:11:19.952]   And just get those compressed down to 20 megabytes so we can just spam email them to every member
[01:11:19.952 --> 01:11:25.112]   of our government and get it drilled into their head that this man is committing open
[01:11:25.112 --> 01:11:31.193]   acts of treason from bringing in terrorists or siphoning off our energy supplies that
[01:11:31.193 --> 01:11:36.032]  we're sitting on and causing us misery and suffering.
[01:11:36.032 --> 01:11:41.432]   And the Declaration of Independence clearly states that a series of usurpations and-
[01:11:41.384 --> 01:11:46.691]  And powers that control us are driving us to desperation and total despotism.
[01:11:46.731 --> 01:11:48.434]  It is our right and duty to do so.
[01:11:49.585 --> 01:11:50.445]  Beautifully said, sir.
[01:11:50.465 --> 01:11:51.126]  Thank you for the call.
[01:11:51.786 --> 01:11:53.186]  Sylvia's calling from Arkansas.
[01:11:53.206 --> 01:11:54.887]  She says, Biden impeachment push.
[01:11:55.367 --> 01:11:56.228]  Everybody's upset.
[01:11:56.308 --> 01:11:59.329]  Yes, he unifies the people to know who's behind it.
[01:11:59.449 --> 01:12:07.592]  Biden is saying the Republicans and the Make America Great Again crowd are the reason he shut off all the oil drilling and the pipelines.
[01:12:08.112 --> 01:12:08.952]  It's preposterous.
[01:12:09.293 --> 01:12:11.093]  But the media is going to gaslight folks with that.
[01:12:11.393 --> 01:12:15.315]  We have to put his feet to the political fire and his controllers.
[01:12:15.615 --> 01:12:17.916]  This is the obvious big move.
[01:12:19.221 --> 01:12:22.322]  On the energy, being shut off, and on the borders.
[01:12:22.562 --> 01:12:24.002]  We got them red-handed on both.
[01:12:24.383 --> 01:12:25.403]  That's where we attack.
[01:12:25.783 --> 01:12:26.703]  That's what we move on.
[01:12:27.003 --> 01:12:28.604]  Not the stupid laptop.
[01:12:29.184 --> 01:12:30.564]  Sylvia, go ahead and tell us what you think.
[01:12:31.765 --> 01:12:33.745]  Hi, this is Sylvia Alex.
[01:12:34.406 --> 01:12:40.527]  Hey, you sound like you're in full-blown panic mode, just like every other American.
[01:12:40.587 --> 01:12:44.629]  I went out to a local hairdresser and dress shop yesterday, locally.
[01:12:45.969 --> 01:12:48.930]  I'm retired, but I'm expecting a great-grandbaby.
[01:12:50.043 --> 01:12:52.705]  The prices in the local dress shop, they're going up.
[01:12:53.265 --> 01:12:55.106]  A $4 necklace now is $12.99.
[01:12:55.527 --> 01:12:58.608]  But the main talk was the baby formula.
[01:12:59.269 --> 01:13:06.133]  We are all getting into full-blown panic mode and we know, you know, it's the gas prices, it's everything.
[01:13:06.553 --> 01:13:11.155]  But when we hear babies crying, you know, that puts us into panic mode.
[01:13:11.356 --> 01:13:13.557]  And we're all ready to do something now.
[01:13:14.190 --> 01:13:17.853]  And so, you're on there, sounding like you're in full-blown panic mode?
[01:13:17.873 --> 01:13:19.434]  That's the way we feel out here!
[01:13:19.814 --> 01:13:21.316]  We're screaming with you!
[01:13:21.776 --> 01:13:22.797]  Let's do something!
[01:13:24.039 --> 01:13:34.723]  Absolutely, and I've got articles here even out of USA Today admitting that a record number of Americans are going hungry, single parents are skipping meals, and again, we know it's designed to only get worse from here.
[01:13:34.763 --> 01:13:35.403]  It's a plan.
[01:13:35.703 --> 01:13:46.526]  So as bad as it is, the reason I'm upset is it's going to get a lot worse, and this is being done deliberately, and we have to make the Republicans stop doing this and stop being part of this, Sylvia.
[01:13:46.926 --> 01:13:48.087]  God bless you, and thank you for the call.
[01:13:49.841 --> 01:13:50.962]  Let's take another call now.
[01:13:51.562 --> 01:13:53.303]  Let's talk to Nick in New York.
[01:13:53.423 --> 01:13:54.604]  Nick, welcome to the Airwaves.
[01:13:56.265 --> 01:13:57.326]  Hey, Alex.
[01:13:57.366 --> 01:13:59.067]  Man, it's an honor to talk to you.
[01:13:59.107 --> 01:14:00.128]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:14:00.148 --> 01:14:00.428]  Thank you.
[01:14:00.528 --> 01:14:02.729]  Thank you for everything you and the crew do, man.
[01:14:02.809 --> 01:14:03.049]  Love you.
[01:14:03.069 --> 01:14:04.951]  Really appreciate it.
[01:14:04.971 --> 01:14:05.551]  Love you, too.
[01:14:05.771 --> 01:14:13.076]  And yeah, so my thing is, we only have two members of Congress on the right that have called out the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab.
[01:14:13.576 --> 01:14:17.138]  It's essentially Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massey did on Twitter.
[01:14:17.158 --> 01:14:18.139]  He didn't even do it vocally.
[01:14:18.706 --> 01:14:19.767]  Nobody knows what's going on.
[01:14:19.807 --> 01:14:23.649]  We got candy asses all across the board in the Republican Party.
[01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:25.851]  From McCarthy, McConnell on down.
[01:14:25.871 --> 01:14:27.132]  McConnell's as corrupt as they get.
[01:14:27.172 --> 01:14:28.633]  His wife works for the CCP.
[01:14:29.213 --> 01:14:33.136]  So, we gotta start protesting our own party, physically.
[01:14:34.005 --> 01:14:43.389]  And let me back you up, Nick, because you're making great points.
[01:14:43.769 --> 01:14:48.892]  In Europe, people like Orban win with 70 plus percent of the vote being anti-New World Order.
[01:14:49.232 --> 01:14:50.472]  Bolsonaro, same deal.
[01:14:50.832 --> 01:14:56.515]  It's true, it's real, it's the right thing to do to be an anti-globalist, anti-Great Reset, Build Back Better person.
[01:14:56.775 --> 01:14:58.396]  The Democrats all admit they're Build Back Better.
[01:14:59.056 --> 01:15:01.557]  All these other patriot leaders are getting elected around the world and fighting.
[01:15:01.637 --> 01:15:02.357]  It's popular.
[01:15:02.717 --> 01:15:03.778]  It's a winning idea.
[01:15:04.538 --> 01:15:07.679]  It's going to save hundreds of millions of lives from starvation in the third world.
[01:15:07.859 --> 01:15:09.180]  It's going to save us from collapse.
[01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:12.341]  But the Republicans are quietly on the payroll.
[01:15:12.361 --> 01:15:13.161]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:15:13.421 --> 01:15:15.862]  They won't even address what we're under attack from.
[01:15:16.502 --> 01:15:17.463]  It's incredible.
[01:15:17.603 --> 01:15:24.925]  And that's why they hate this show so much, why they hate you, is because if we finally get this out there, their attempted power grab will be their Waterloo.
[01:15:25.245 --> 01:15:26.666]  It'll be their defeat.
[01:15:28.326 --> 01:15:29.006]  Absolutely, man.
[01:15:29.206 --> 01:15:30.767]  And Trump could use his plan.
[01:15:30.887 --> 01:15:34.028]  They're going to steal from him again because we haven't fixed the voter registration rolls.
[01:15:34.048 --> 01:15:34.748]  They've got to get it all clean.
[01:15:34.768 --> 01:15:36.069]  They're going to fix it again and win it.
[01:15:36.309 --> 01:15:40.350]  But Trump could use his campaign to educate everyone on the New World Order.
[01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:46.852]  He needs to call out the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, all these people, and even Elon Musk.
[01:15:46.892 --> 01:15:52.274]  Elon Musk called for a one-world government at the World Economic Forum this year, according to BDM.com or whatever.
[01:15:52.314 --> 01:15:59.852]   I don't know if that's true, but Elon Musk is for everything they're for, carbon taxes, Yeah, he's playing both sides.
[01:16:00.012 --> 01:16:01.654]  He's a smarter version of him.
[01:16:02.874 --> 01:16:04.335]  Yeah, absolutely, man.
[01:16:04.636 --> 01:16:07.678]  Dude, Alex, I love you, man, and we're going to win this.
[01:16:07.698 --> 01:16:08.378]  We're going to win this.
[01:16:08.398 --> 01:16:09.039]  We're going to unite.
[01:16:09.099 --> 01:16:10.800]  Humanity is awakening right now.
[01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:12.682]  We will rise up and we will win this.
[01:16:13.062 --> 01:16:13.562]  We have to.
[01:16:13.662 --> 01:16:14.963]  Thank you so much for the call, sir.
[01:16:14.983 --> 01:16:15.444]  Great points.
[01:16:16.499 --> 01:16:18.020]  Let me say this is going to break them up with more calls.
[01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:20.962]  Think of the arrogance of they're just getting started.
[01:16:21.002 --> 01:16:21.902]  Look how horrible it is.
[01:16:22.663 --> 01:16:27.085]  But they've gotten away with it in Latin America and Africa and the Middle East and areas of Asia.
[01:16:27.545 --> 01:16:30.147]  And so, I mean, they're doing it.
[01:16:30.467 --> 01:16:32.268]  I mean, they are really doing it.
[01:16:32.748 --> 01:16:41.613]  And again, if you're a new listener, go back two years ago, 27 months ago, I laid all this out and said exactly this will happen and exactly this has happened.
[01:16:41.673 --> 01:16:42.894]  And then it just gets worse from here.
[01:16:43.274 --> 01:16:44.455]  And ask yourself, how do I know that?
[01:16:45.492 --> 01:16:48.293]  Because the globalists admit their plan.
[01:16:48.393 --> 01:16:56.036]  And that's why I keep hammering that over and over and over and over and over and over again.
[01:16:56.856 --> 01:16:57.757]  We're under attack.
[01:16:57.797 --> 01:17:00.418]  We have to know who is attacking us and what their plan is.
[01:17:00.638 --> 01:17:01.738]  And their plan is public.
[01:17:02.038 --> 01:17:04.959]  To win a war, you have to know who is attacking you and what their plan is.
[01:17:05.179 --> 01:17:05.760]  We have it!
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:06.660]  We have them!
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:08.261]  They will be easy to defeat!
[01:17:08.461 --> 01:17:08.881]  Stay with us.
[01:17:10.410 --> 01:17:18.497]  Look, we're sitting here watching powerful economic forces play God on us, who say we don't even have a right to live, that we're not essential.
[01:17:19.898 --> 01:17:25.903]  We're watching them starve tens of millions of people every few months to death around the world, on top of normally who dies.
[01:17:27.564 --> 01:17:31.747]  And pushing euthanasia for old people and sterilization of children.
[01:17:31.767 --> 01:17:34.930]  This is an evil cult we're facing of transhumanists.
[01:17:36.671 --> 01:17:38.573]  And they're using economic warfare on us right now.
[01:17:40.083 --> 01:17:41.823]  If we don't raise the alarm, nobody will.
[01:17:42.624 --> 01:17:43.044]  And we are.
[01:17:43.064 --> 01:17:44.684]  And that's why this broadcast is so special.
[01:17:44.704 --> 01:17:51.546]  That's why I thank you for always spreading the word and for getting great products that will enrich you and your family's lives at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:17:59.921 --> 01:18:01.302]  Ultra 12 just came back in.
[01:18:01.323 --> 01:18:02.043]  We got plenty of that.
[01:18:02.063 --> 01:18:03.365]  X2 is going to sell out quickly.
[01:18:03.805 --> 01:18:06.428]  These are really game-changing products, and they fund the InfoWars.

[01:18:11.393 --> 01:18:12.614]  But action is what's needed here.
[01:18:13.415 --> 01:18:17.499]  The world is on the verge of stopping this, but we've got to take action.
[01:18:17.539 --> 01:18:18.560]  We've got to raise the alarm.
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:19.621]  You are the Paul Reveres.
[01:18:20.902 --> 01:18:21.463]  You are the hope.
[01:18:23.083 --> 01:18:25.865]  Let's talk to Alex, Lewis, and Cameron in this segment.
[01:18:25.885 --> 01:18:33.670]  Then Dr. Fleming is going to join us with massive COVID news and the big developments that are coming out there that are so important.
[01:18:34.071 --> 01:18:36.272]  They want us to go back to sleep while they ready the next attack.
[01:18:36.653 --> 01:18:37.934]  I've got Bill Gates on COVID.
[01:18:38.094 --> 01:18:40.115]  I don't want to be the voice of doom and gloom.
[01:18:40.135 --> 01:18:40.755]  Yeah, right.
[01:18:41.276 --> 01:18:43.477]  But the worst is still yet to come.
[01:18:43.517 --> 01:18:44.758]  That's coming up.
[01:18:44.818 --> 01:18:45.999]  Breaking news next hour.
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:47.921]  But right now, let's go to your calls.
[01:18:48.641 --> 01:18:54.606]  Let's talk to Alex in North Carolina.
[01:18:54.646 --> 01:18:55.006]  Go ahead.
[01:18:57.428 --> 01:18:58.729]  Hey Alex, nice to meet you.
[01:18:58.869 --> 01:19:03.613]  I've been watching you since 1999, kind of dropped off, come back a couple times.
[01:19:04.433 --> 01:19:07.616]  Anyway, I've been calling for a couple weeks and finally got a hold to you.
[01:19:07.636 --> 01:19:08.597]  I wanted to let everybody know.
[01:19:08.657 --> 01:19:09.818]  I'm glad you got in, Alex.
[01:19:09.858 --> 01:19:10.138]  Thank you.
[01:19:11.588 --> 01:19:12.209]  Oh alright, thanks.
[01:19:12.609 --> 01:19:15.451]  So I wanted to let you guys know, I wanted to get it out there.
[01:19:15.971 --> 01:19:22.736]  There's a lot of non-believers out there of what's really going on and we're getting hit with it in so many different directions.
[01:19:23.356 --> 01:19:29.961]  It's hard for people to understand because they can't wrap their head around how many different levels that this attack is coming in on.
[01:19:30.701 --> 01:19:37.146]  So I wanted to give out a website and it's actually a website that's tracking the food shortage.
[01:19:38.217 --> 01:19:45.243]  And it's actually being funded by a lot of the elites, and Bill Gates is one of them.
[01:19:45.263 --> 01:19:50.587]  And you can go on here and actually look at the donors who is actually funding this project.
[01:19:50.987 --> 01:19:52.508]  But anyway, let me give you the website.
[01:19:52.648 --> 01:19:54.109]  It's ISPRI.org.
[01:19:58.982 --> 01:20:08.310]  And then COVID-19, this is the actual name of the project, COVID-19 Food Trade Policy Tracker.
[01:20:09.011 --> 01:20:13.254]  When you get on this website, you can actually scroll all the way to the very bottom.
[01:20:14.195 --> 01:20:19.159]  One, you can look at the donors who is actually funding this project.
[01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:27.900]   Now, what is ironic about this They are tracking this by K-calories and also by U.S.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.346]  dollars that's coming or actually being lost in the United States of America.
[01:20:32.366 --> 01:20:42.618]  So, on this front page, one, you can scroll all the way to the bottom and look at the donors, and two, at the very top it says to view the tracker, please click here.
[01:20:43.423 --> 01:20:44.664]  And I don't know if you're following this.
[01:20:44.724 --> 01:20:47.305]  I can't see your, you know, I can't see your website or not.
[01:20:47.345 --> 01:20:49.686]  But anyway, yes, we have it on screen.
[01:20:49.746 --> 01:20:54.129]  And yes, they admit they use the COVID lockdown to destroy the world's supply chain.
[01:20:54.909 --> 01:20:55.750]  And that's what they're doing.
[01:20:55.770 --> 01:20:57.130]  It's all about depopulation.
[01:20:57.150 --> 01:21:01.553]  And it's all about policies in Europe that don't even let people basically farm anymore.
[01:21:01.933 --> 01:21:03.934]  And in the UK, they're paying people not to farm.
[01:21:04.314 --> 01:21:24.400]   It's about creating artificial scarcity and basically planned obsolescence into the human system to collapse The new world order is corporate global governance that create policies that consolidate power and control while they enslave us.
[01:21:24.501 --> 01:21:28.045]  That's the definition of their new world order as a corporate world government.
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:30.261]  That's exactly right.
[01:21:30.341 --> 01:21:34.163]  So, I want everybody to get this out there and share it with other peoples.
[01:21:34.203 --> 01:21:41.007]  For one, for the non-believers that can go here and see exactly what countries are restricted and what by calories.
[01:21:41.467 --> 01:21:49.752]  And then you can go on here and once you get to the tracker page, you know, scroll over three times and it says list of export restrictions of food products.
[01:21:50.312 --> 01:21:58.557]  And once you click on that little tab or, you know, whatever it is, you just scroll down and it'll show you the countries that are sitting there, what they've been restricted.
[01:21:59.011 --> 01:22:00.371]  Hey Alex, it's an honor.
[01:22:00.190 --> 01:22:05.909]   and there's been a massive amount of countries restricted since March of this year.
[01:22:05.909 --> 01:22:08.150]  So they've been tracking it since 2020.
[01:22:08.150 --> 01:22:10.150]  That's right, it has nothing to do with COVID.
[01:22:10.150 --> 01:22:14.109]   It's all the IMF and World Bank, through State Department memorandum 200,
[01:22:14.109 --> 01:22:15.150]  starving the world.
[01:22:15.150 --> 01:22:17.190]  It is an official plan.
[01:22:17.190 --> 01:22:18.190]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:22:18.190 --> 01:22:20.670]  Powerful call, bringing you right to the documents.
[01:22:20.670 --> 01:22:21.550]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:23.510]  Lewis in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:26.510]  Hey Alex, it's an honor.
[01:22:26.510 --> 01:22:28.190]  Honor to talk to you. - First time caller.
[01:22:28.190 --> 01:22:29.029]  Thank you, sir.
[01:22:29.549 --> 01:22:34.832]  So, on one of your ads, you say that exposing the paradigm of globalism will be the way to win this Infowar.
[01:22:35.392 --> 01:22:38.194]  It is my opinion that El Paso is the place to do so.
[01:22:38.714 --> 01:22:48.240]  El Paso, in my opinion, is ground zero for the globalist takeover of America, and they have codified their plans in something called the El Paso Resilient Plan.
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:56.885]  Not a lot of people know this, but El Paso was part of this 100 Resilient Cities Plan that ended just days before the mass shooting that happened at Walmart.
[01:22:57.327 --> 01:23:04.412]  Now, I had a chance to interview County Judge Samaniego, who is the highest elected official here.
[01:23:04.892 --> 01:23:21.343]  He admitted to me that three years ago, before the human caravans had really come to light, he was already coordinating with the mayor and the city of El Paso, as well as the Catholic Charities, who are now in charge of the logistics with regards to this.
[01:23:21.783 --> 01:23:25.406]  Okay, so it's all UN agreement, NGO controlled, all on record?
[01:23:26.135 --> 01:23:30.996]  I believe that if people started getting arrested here, and there's plenty of reasons why they should be arrested.
[01:23:31.016 --> 01:23:46.401]  Well that's the thing, I mean even the conservative states just arrest the illegals and turn them loose, and then the organizations involved in the human smuggling violating law, including unaccompanied small children being handed over to random strangers, if the FBI did their job this wouldn't be happening, but the law is not being enforced and it is incredible.
[01:23:47.056 --> 01:23:52.740]  No, that's why public sentiment plays a really big part in this, and I think nationally, all eyes have to be on El Paso.
[01:23:53.020 --> 01:24:00.305]  It wasn't by accident that they sent Kamala Harris here to El Paso, though it wasn't the main place, volume-wise, where stuff was going on.
[01:24:00.686 --> 01:24:09.012]  The El Paso Resilient Plan, it shows how globalists have now been given access to all of our infrastructure.
[01:24:11.033 --> 01:24:14.055]  Rockefeller actually integrated a C-level position.
[01:24:14.075 --> 01:24:16.117]  It's called Chief Resiliency Officer.
[01:24:17.310 --> 01:24:24.712]  That's right, they call collapsing the border and using your resources to further bankrupt you a resilience.
[01:24:25.052 --> 01:24:26.832]  When you hear something smart, it means slavery.
[01:24:27.053 --> 01:24:28.793]  When you hear resilient, it means you're not resilient.
[01:24:28.813 --> 01:24:30.893]  When you hear sustainable, it means unsustainable.
[01:24:30.793 --> 01:24:32.793]  Everything means the opposite.
[01:24:32.793 --> 01:24:39.793]   Lieutenant Governor of New York was just arrested for steering contracts COVID-related to people
[01:24:39.793 --> 01:24:42.072]  that he had favored.
[01:24:42.072 --> 01:24:44.793]   If we can do it- That's right, but Biden is allowed to steer it all to his
[01:24:44.793 --> 01:24:45.193]  friends.
[01:24:45.467 --> 01:24:46.547]  You're a really smart caller.
[01:24:46.567 --> 01:24:48.087]  These have been incredible calls.
[01:24:48.147 --> 01:24:48.767]  Thank you, Lois.
[01:24:48.787 --> 01:24:49.768]  I've got to get to the next person.
[01:24:50.048 --> 01:24:50.508]  Powerful.
[01:24:50.988 --> 01:24:52.948]  Cameron in Texas, last caller in the hour.
[01:24:52.968 --> 01:24:53.348]  Go ahead.
[01:24:54.809 --> 01:24:55.169]  Hey, Alex.
[01:24:55.209 --> 01:24:55.789]  How's it going?
[01:24:55.929 --> 01:24:56.449]  Good, brother.
[01:24:56.589 --> 01:24:59.670]  I'm a listener and a personal caller.
[01:25:00.370 --> 01:25:20.421]   I'm a blood-washed believer ever since I was really little, and I work for The county insurance department and I'm seeing a lot of terrible things regarding with this whole thing that Biden is doing is it's affecting what's happening in the jails as well.
[01:25:20.621 --> 01:25:26.322]  I mean, these people are enticing people with honey buns just to get them to take these shots.
[01:25:26.922 --> 01:25:29.603]  And then on top of that, you have what's going on at the border.
[01:25:29.683 --> 01:25:31.523]  Our taxes are funding what's going on.
[01:25:31.563 --> 01:25:34.604]  My mind is like completely overloaded and blown regarding that.
[01:25:35.244 --> 01:25:38.774]   Then you have him in What was it, August, September?
[01:25:39.154 --> 01:25:42.976]  Admitting that they're going to completely steal the election.
[01:25:43.036 --> 01:25:52.301]  So I think what we need to do is we need to find some people that have honor and that want to stand up for justice that are left.
[01:25:52.601 --> 01:25:53.422]  And that's the question.
[01:25:53.502 --> 01:25:54.142]  Where are they?
[01:25:54.262 --> 01:25:59.485]  Who are these people that are going to actually do their job and hold these people accountable one by one?
[01:25:59.885 --> 01:26:03.087]  When they start seeing them fall like dominoes, I think the rest will fall in place.
[01:26:03.723 --> 01:26:07.625]  Well, because the globalists control the Justice Department, all this crime is allowed to go on.
[01:26:08.425 --> 01:26:09.425]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:26:09.465 --> 01:26:12.066]  That's why we've got to have state grand juries and other people take action.
[01:26:12.086 --> 01:26:15.768]  And it's going to happen because we don't have a choice.
[01:26:15.808 --> 01:26:20.189]  But that's why Soros has put in over 900 district attorneys and county attorneys.
[01:26:20.209 --> 01:26:23.130]  That's why he's put in 20 plus state attorney generals.
[01:26:23.170 --> 01:26:28.172]  So they are now creating a totally lawless atmosphere to collapse the country, brother.
[01:26:28.192 --> 01:26:30.393]  It's very, very historic what's happening.
[01:26:30.413 --> 01:26:32.214]  It's just we're in the middle of the takeover right now.
[01:26:33.641 --> 01:26:34.822]  It's really demoralizing.
[01:26:34.982 --> 01:26:40.806]  And as a believer, you see, where do you go to find true believers that are actually together worshiping?
[01:26:41.407 --> 01:26:56.117]   What's happening is, not only are they dividing us as a country, but they're dividing us spiritually, because now they've encroached this new world ecumenical movement Absolutely, and they're just normalizing all of it.
[01:26:56.137 --> 01:26:58.518]  They bought off the churches, and this is their big move.
[01:26:58.538 --> 01:26:59.158]  They're making their move.
[01:26:59.178 --> 01:26:59.859]  We're living it right now.
[01:27:00.259 --> 01:27:01.179]  Thank you so much, Cameron.
[01:27:01.199 --> 01:27:03.380]  That's why this is the main beacon.
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:04.461]  I wish we weren't.
[01:27:04.481 --> 01:27:08.682]  I wish more people were this hardcore, but that's why they hate us the most is we've got their number.
[01:27:08.702 --> 01:27:09.543]  We know how to stop them.
[01:27:09.583 --> 01:27:10.483]  We have the solution.
[01:27:10.803 --> 01:27:12.424]  You have the solution, and I thank you all.
[01:27:12.783 --> 01:27:34.384]  hour number three with Dr. Fleming straight ahead.
[01:27:34.384 --> 01:27:37.263]   And we've been getting a lot of crypto donations which is keeping us on air.
[01:27:37.263 --> 01:27:40.462]   I want to salute all those you know who you are that have been giving the donations.

[01:28:05.662 --> 01:28:08.644]  And by the way, we've got our own NFTs at Arnescam.
[01:28:08.684 --> 01:28:11.865]  They're totally badass and total victory coming out next week.
[01:28:11.905 --> 01:28:12.766]  I'll tell you about that later.
[01:28:13.146 --> 01:28:16.109]  But right now, InfoWars.com forward slash crypto.
[01:28:16.150 --> 01:28:18.232]  The real revolution is happening now.
[01:28:18.312 --> 01:28:20.515]  InfoWars.com forward slash crypto.
[01:28:20.355 --> 01:28:27.355]  doing all of you that donated we salute you and thank you.
[01:28:27.355 --> 01:28:29.874]  There's no easy way out of this.
[01:28:29.874 --> 01:28:39.874]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:28:31.149 --> 01:28:36.271]  In fact, people thinking they go along to get along is what has allowed us to get in this position now.
[01:28:36.712 --> 01:28:40.313]  And the more you submit now, the more you're going to be enslaved.
[01:28:40.534 --> 01:28:54.040]  Because this has been the plan stated to cut off your carbon, to cut off your life, to cut off your mobility, to absolutely bring you down to below a third world status, and then lower the third world into total starvation.
[01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:56.481]  This is the globalist plan for total dependency.
[01:28:57.241 --> 01:29:00.023]  Now the good news is here, most people won't starve to death in the U.S.
[01:29:01.363 --> 01:29:03.664]  But in the third world, it is a death sentence.
[01:29:03.844 --> 01:29:06.505]  And so here's a headline that really gave me an epiphany.
[01:29:08.325 --> 01:29:09.046]  London Guardian.
[01:29:09.926 --> 01:29:14.868]  Coronavirus pandemic will cause famine of biblical proportions.
[01:29:16.168 --> 01:29:20.850]  Between 30 and 100 million set to starve to death in the next 18 months.
[01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:25.351]  Now, that's an incredibly deceptive headline.
[01:29:26.271 --> 01:29:30.679]   The coronavirus Lockdown.
[01:29:33.121 --> 01:29:35.003]  Coronavirus lock.
[01:29:39.088 --> 01:29:39.489]  D-O-W-N.
[01:29:39.969 --> 01:29:41.571]  Published while educated.
[01:29:42.432 --> 01:29:51.109]   Coronavirus lockdown will cause famine of biblical Proportions.
[01:29:51.870 --> 01:29:55.292]  Hundreds of millions will starve to death if this global depression really gets kicking off.
[01:29:55.533 --> 01:29:56.814]  The UN now confirms.
[01:29:57.654 --> 01:29:59.495]  Not 10 million set to starve to death this year.
[01:29:59.516 --> 01:30:00.977]  30 million.
[01:30:01.297 --> 01:30:04.879]  But they're the savior that will collect the money and then give none of it to the people.
[01:30:04.899 --> 01:30:06.240]  They'll have a few photo ops.
[01:30:08.642 --> 01:30:11.544]  I told you 2 million extra were starving to death from numbers I saw a few weeks ago.
[01:30:11.584 --> 01:30:13.506]  Now they say it's 30 million.
[01:30:13.606 --> 01:30:14.546]  Probably more than that.
[01:30:16.368 --> 01:30:17.849]  But you're not going to have them humanized.
[01:30:17.909 --> 01:30:26.798]   And we need the president to come out We need the President to fly on a jet tour to the poorest area of Latin America and to Africa and in an area of Asia.
[01:30:26.658 --> 01:30:35.858]   Just think, go to India, where they report millions are starving to death right now.
[01:30:35.858 --> 01:30:37.177]  It's just like, oh, it's a footnote.
[01:30:37.145 --> 01:30:38.386]  They say a couple million are starving.
[01:30:38.406 --> 01:30:40.707]  Yeah, people are dying by the thousands every day, malnutrition.
[01:30:41.368 --> 01:30:43.169]  You just shrivel up and you get a cold and you die.
[01:30:44.079 --> 01:30:45.940]  And they add that to the coronavirus numbers.
[01:30:47.020 --> 01:30:51.041]  30 million people are starving to death on top of those who are already starving to death according to the UN.
[01:30:51.061 --> 01:30:51.861]  Those numbers are accurate.
[01:30:53.221 --> 01:30:53.902]  30 million people.
[01:30:54.282 --> 01:30:56.462]  How many have died worldwide from the virus?
[01:30:57.303 --> 01:31:02.644]  An extra 20 million people on top of the 10 million already starving to death are dying right now.
[01:31:02.824 --> 01:31:03.784]  These are real people.
[01:31:03.804 --> 01:31:06.165]  These are little kids with ribs sticking out on them, okay?
[01:31:07.537 --> 01:31:13.462]  And my God, the liberals are always like, oh, let's go take abandoned dogs and cats and let's take them in and take care of them.
[01:31:13.482 --> 01:31:13.902]  Okay, great.
[01:31:14.603 --> 01:31:16.485]  How about we take care of some people?
[01:31:16.965 --> 01:31:19.307]  They want you to believe if you leave your house, you're going to die.
[01:31:21.089 --> 01:31:22.970]  The human civilization will end.
[01:31:23.050 --> 01:31:24.091]  Billions will starve to death.
[01:31:24.111 --> 01:31:28.895]  The UN now says 133 million are set to starve to death this year, not the 30 million.
[01:31:30.276 --> 01:31:31.958]  That was a UN release yesterday.
[01:31:33.328 --> 01:31:35.789]  So this is escalating quickly.
[01:31:35.809 --> 01:31:43.173]  And on the Owen Schroer War Room yesterday, they had a great graphic, I saw on InfoWars, of a big, giant Grim Reaper next to a baby Grim Reaper.
[01:31:43.993 --> 01:31:45.634]  And the baby Grim Reaper is COVID-19.
[01:31:45.714 --> 01:31:49.376]  He says, hey, if you haven't seen what poverty and starvation does, I'm the big daddy.
[01:31:49.796 --> 01:31:51.177]  That's the mission accomplished.
[01:31:51.617 --> 01:31:53.118]  That's been the globalist plan.
[01:31:54.358 --> 01:31:57.800]  So while we're losing our liberties and our future, the third world's losing their lives.
[01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:02.971]   So those that want to grandstand about, we're saving lives by doing this, No, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:04.432 --> 01:32:06.452]  This is all part of a psychological warfare op.
[01:32:07.393 --> 01:32:10.534]  But this isn't hydrogen bombs that are being dropped.
[01:32:10.574 --> 01:32:24.358]  This is cutting off the infrastructure for us here in the first world, bringing us to third world status, and bringing the third world to starvation, mass collapse, death status.
[01:32:28.675 --> 01:32:41.042]  So, these planes coming in to drop hydrogen bombs are already over the targets, and they're already killing hundreds of thousands of people a week, are now starving to death, according to the UN themselves.
[01:32:41.722 --> 01:32:43.063]  And by the way, those numbers are accurate.
[01:32:44.023 --> 01:32:51.827]  But notice, it's the UN launching this, cutting off the economy, directing it, our new boss, the WHO, the gold standard.
[01:32:53.828 --> 01:33:03.951]   But with the other hand, They've got David Beasley, a well-spoken American, who probably is a good person, going, please help us, we need hundreds of millions of dollars donated right now, everybody's dying!
[01:33:04.712 --> 01:33:08.352]  So they create the problem, and then they have the solution.
[01:33:09.172 --> 01:33:12.613]  Then I said, well fine, once all the food runs out, I'll just eat my liberal neighbors.
[01:33:14.113 --> 01:33:16.934]  Knowing they'd pick it up, but they edited it down to one minute.
[01:33:17.333 --> 01:33:23.333]   I did it to draw attention to the starvation because when the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[01:33:23.333 --> 01:33:38.333]  [Music]
[01:33:38.333 --> 01:33:43.333]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:33:43.333 --> 01:33:45.333]  [Splash]
[01:33:45.815 --> 01:33:52.040]  If you had asked me all this stuff a year ago about the corruption that's going on, I would have said you're crazy.
[01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:56.203]  There's no way that there could be this level of corruption in government.
[01:33:56.243 --> 01:34:04.570]  You shouldn't listen to InfoWars and Band.Video because that's all nonsense and, you know, we shouldn't pay attention to any of this stuff.
[01:34:07.791 --> 01:34:17.774]  It's been very evident to me that all these people who are being labeled as misinformation spreaders, I mean, they're the guys telling the truth.
[01:34:18.255 --> 01:34:26.017]  There are many thousands of physicians who have been silenced for telling the American people the good news about the situation, that we can manage the virus.
[01:34:26.477 --> 01:34:30.181]  The true misinformation spreaders are the CDC and the public health officials.
[01:34:30.401 --> 01:34:33.684]  This remains a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[01:34:33.804 --> 01:34:36.427]  They are the ones that are propagating this outbreak.
[01:34:36.447 --> 01:34:38.649]  The only people you can blame, this isn't shaming, this is the truth.
[01:34:39.069 --> 01:34:41.512]  Maybe they should be shamed, are the unvaccinated.
[01:34:42.032 --> 01:34:46.416]  This is a situation of an outbreak and a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[01:34:46.377 --> 01:34:50.377]   Dr. Fauci's probably done more good for the world than all of us in this room combined.
[01:34:50.377 --> 01:34:50.877]  I mean...
[01:34:50.877 --> 01:34:55.677]  [applause]
[01:34:55.677 --> 01:35:01.777]   Dr. Fauci, knowing that it is a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement of May 11th
[01:35:01.777 --> 01:35:06.076]   where you claimed that the NIH never funded gain-of-function research in Wuhan?
[01:35:06.242 --> 01:35:07.863]  I totally resent that.
[01:35:07.963 --> 01:35:11.586]  And if anybody is lying here, Senator, it is you!
[01:35:11.746 --> 01:35:24.536]  We now know that Fauci-funded EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based nonprofit headed by Peter Daszak, was absolutely engaged in gain-of-function research to make chimeric SARS-based coronaviruses, which they confirmed could infect human cells.
[01:35:24.676 --> 01:35:25.397]  And the worst part?
[01:35:25.877 --> 01:35:30.301]  All the people going along and being lab rats for these heartless megacorporations.
[01:35:30.762 --> 01:35:32.103]  It is truly incredible.
[01:35:32.423 --> 01:35:37.828]  If only people had the entire story that the COVID shots are not conventional vaccines.
[01:35:38.229 --> 01:35:44.034]  There are plenty of examples of people that are having very serious medical conditions that result from the vaccination.
[01:35:44.194 --> 01:35:48.398]  When the convulsion started, I knew it had to be from the vaccine.
[01:35:48.658 --> 01:35:53.681]  Due to this vaccine, I don't even know if I'll gain a full movement in my leg back.
[01:35:53.962 --> 01:35:56.323]  One of their high school football players died.
[01:35:56.343 --> 01:36:00.386]  He had two blood clots inside his brain, another on the outside of his brain.
[01:36:00.406 --> 01:36:02.727]  The hardest thing was I let him get that shot.
[01:36:03.068 --> 01:36:06.710]  I got the vaccine!
[01:36:06.529 --> 01:36:15.529]  We need help.
[01:36:15.529 --> 01:36:25.529]  [Music]
[01:36:25.529 --> 01:36:37.529]  [Music]
[01:36:37.529 --> 01:36:40.648]  For the Balance of the Hour, the Alex Jones Show, Dr.
[01:36:40.648 --> 01:36:42.529]  Richard M. Fleming is our guest.
[01:36:42.493 --> 01:36:50.496]  He's a cardiologist, nuclear cardiologist, certified positron emission tomography, jurisprudence doctor, law researcher, inventor, and author.
[01:36:50.516 --> 01:36:55.418]  I'm not going to go over all of his inventions or all of the international programs in 2020 and everything else he's been on.
[01:36:55.438 --> 01:36:58.379]  He's a frequent guest here at FlemingMethod.com.
[01:36:59.020 --> 01:37:03.261]  And we've got a lot of big breaking news in the month or two it's been since he's been on.
[01:37:03.721 --> 01:37:06.383]  New information on spike proteins, covariance, 28 of them.
[01:37:07.563 --> 01:37:11.206]  More explanation about how spike protein is not snake venom.
[01:37:11.767 --> 01:37:14.209]  Excess deaths with and without COVID-19.
[01:37:15.170 --> 01:37:17.012]  And inviting Fauci for a discussion.
[01:37:17.512 --> 01:37:19.034]  And these numbers out of Walgreens.
[01:37:20.188 --> 01:37:33.554]  That people that are double and triple vaxxed are way more likely to get COVID and numbers coming out of Europe and Israel way more likely to get sick from it and some of those other numbers that have come out from the insurance companies.
[01:37:33.614 --> 01:37:39.457]  So Dr. Fleming joins us now to go over all of that data.
[01:37:40.077 --> 01:37:41.338]  We can start with Walgreens.
[01:37:41.358 --> 01:37:42.838]  We can start with the new variants.
[01:37:42.858 --> 01:37:45.159]  We can start with their plans for more lockdowns.
[01:37:45.179 --> 01:37:46.780]  They've already been telegraphing and admitting.
[01:37:47.140 --> 01:37:48.741]  Dr. Fleming, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:37:50.359 --> 01:37:51.420]  My pleasure to be here Alex.
[01:37:51.481 --> 01:37:52.522]  Thank you for the invitation.
[01:37:53.403 --> 01:37:54.304]  We need to get updates.
[01:37:54.324 --> 01:37:55.145]  This is important.
[01:37:55.726 --> 01:37:56.848]  These are crimes against humanity.
[01:37:56.908 --> 01:38:00.032]  It's ongoing and they're planning a second obvious operation.
[01:38:00.452 --> 01:38:02.956]  Where do you want to go first?
[01:38:04.858 --> 01:38:08.841]  Well, the first place is to let people know that there's two basic needs right now.
[01:38:09.001 --> 01:38:09.582]  Information.
[01:38:10.122 --> 01:38:16.107]  Clear, concise, proven information, which you've received many of the documents on.
[01:38:16.567 --> 01:38:21.611]  And the second is a plan of action to stop the problems that are currently going on.
[01:38:22.052 --> 01:38:24.754]  That is what the Crimes Against Humanity Tour is about.
[01:38:25.634 --> 01:38:52.354]  This was a tour that was put together over the last year and a half and my express goal here is to provide clean information that any grand jury, any person, but particularly any grand jury convened by a state governor can look at to know that charges should be filed against Anthony Fauci and a number of other individuals in the federal government for what are crimes against humanity.
[01:38:54.255 --> 01:39:09.067]  Gain-of-function research that has been going on for several decades have clearly violated the Biological Weapons Convention Treaty, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Helsinki Code, the Nuremberg Code.
[01:39:09.607 --> 01:39:27.752]   The federal judge in the Southern District of Texas ruled in the Jennifer v. Houston case last year that Methodist Hospital could not be held legally liable for these criminal actions because they're not a government.
[01:39:28.273 --> 01:39:34.039]  And in fact, those three words, not a government, are critical moving forward in federal court.
[01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:55.448]   That federal judge clearly then stated that a federal government or an individual working for the federal government who violates Now these Biological Weapons Convention treaties and the informed consent and the rules that were established in 1947 in Nuremberg can be held legally accountable and it's time to hold these individuals accountable.
[01:39:55.949 --> 01:40:07.374]  If Anthony Fauci and the rest want to provide evidence that this gain-of-function research was not somehow a biological weapon agent, that they weren't violating the U.S.
[01:40:07.454 --> 01:40:15.146]   Constitution, Then he has been given an opportunity to do that.
[01:40:15.346 --> 01:40:24.590]  I have sent emails to him and he and his office have responded back that they're way too busy to do this now on the 19th of June.
[01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:51.410]   So I have sent emails offering the 11th of June or any other time during this tour or at any point in time that he wants to have a legitimate Conversation, because he works for the people of the United States and he has an obligation to provide evidence to the people of the United States that what is clearly gain-of-function research has not violated these treaties and is not an amount to treason.
[01:40:54.383 --> 01:40:58.007]  And that's what you professionally should do and journalistically and medically.
[01:40:58.408 --> 01:41:00.530]  You're reaching out and giving them a chance to respond.
[01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:13.246]  He'll go out there on these countless talk shows that are financed by Bill Gates and spout lies all day and they've now had to admit so much of what they said was a lie, but at the same time their answer is to censor you and I and silence the people.
[01:41:15.157 --> 01:41:17.759]  Absolutely, and the people aren't having anything to do with it.
[01:41:17.839 --> 01:41:41.078]  Every time we have taken this information to a test group and asked the people, is there enough information in the video deposition that I've given, in the book, is COVID-19 a bioweapon, and in the complaint or affidavit that I have online, is there enough information in here to indict these individuals, including Anthony Fauci, for crimes against humanity?
[01:41:41.458 --> 01:41:43.520]  Every single person has said yes.
[01:41:44.128 --> 01:41:53.654]  No, we're waiting for at this point in time is for a state attorney general to convene a grand jury to provide this information and to begin the indictment process.
[01:41:53.814 --> 01:41:59.658]  It's very clear that decades of research has done nothing beneficial for mankind.
[01:42:00.359 --> 01:42:08.510]   If we look at the gain of function research for this coronavirus, And we look at the fact that the vaccines are the same genetic code.
[01:42:08.890 --> 01:42:13.652]  And as you said, this isn't Cobra Venom or Crepe Venom or anything else.
[01:42:14.132 --> 01:42:22.715]  You know, in the last presentation in Chicago, I showed the molecular structure of the spike protein and snake venom.
[01:42:23.155 --> 01:42:27.417]  This is nothing more than smoke and mirrors being thrown out there to confuse people.
[01:42:28.271 --> 01:42:34.535]  And that's a great way to tear the system apart and get people confused and more confused.
[01:42:34.755 --> 01:42:41.339]  Meanwhile, they're coming out with statements that there's going to be a million more cases and we're going to have to consider remasking.
[01:42:41.439 --> 01:42:45.101]  I listened to a news media report in the Chicago area.
[01:42:45.141 --> 01:42:48.063]  They went out to the people and said, well, would you mask back up?
[01:42:48.083 --> 01:42:52.819]   And the people A person said, well, of course, if we need to do that, we will remask up.
[01:42:53.279 --> 01:42:59.022]  It doesn't take very much to manipulate the American people when you have them so stressed and so concerned.
[01:42:59.282 --> 01:43:05.065]  And when you have massive surveillance and censorship of the real medical establishment, warning this is all a giant fraud.
[01:43:05.105 --> 01:43:11.809]  We've really seen tens of thousands of prominent doctors and scientists come out and really tell the truth and be vindicated.
[01:43:12.269 --> 01:43:14.791]  So now Bill Gates's answer is to censor you even more.
[01:43:14.811 --> 01:43:17.192]  And they now have this new Ministry of Truth they're establishing.
[01:43:17.452 --> 01:43:18.573]  Dr. Fleming, please stay with us.
[01:43:20.404 --> 01:43:25.208]  Dr. Richard Fleming is our guest, a renowned medical doctor, and he's with us here.
[01:43:25.248 --> 01:43:28.450]  He's also a doctor of medical law.
[01:43:29.891 --> 01:43:31.032]  And we're talking about solutions.
[01:43:31.052 --> 01:43:33.774]  We're talking about how to take action and put these criminals in the hot seat.
[01:43:35.335 --> 01:43:41.960]  They've admitted they backed off their COVID tyranny for now because the opposition was mounting, and they could see they were going to be brought to justice.
[01:43:41.980 --> 01:43:44.722]  So they backed off a little bit, but are planning to bring it back.
[01:43:44.742 --> 01:43:56.924]   That's why we've got to press the attack, bring them to justice, be informed, And now that we've had a couple years of these gene therapy injections taking place, we see the aftermath.
[01:43:56.984 --> 01:43:57.825]  It's just incredible.
[01:43:58.205 --> 01:44:00.868]  And it becomes clearer and clearer what the larger plan was.
[01:44:01.508 --> 01:44:13.460]  Can you give us the 35,000-foot view here on now as more time's gone on, we're discovering exactly what's happening, and then drill into the Walgreens data and some of this other just incredible insurance data that's coming out?
[01:44:15.034 --> 01:44:20.498]  Well, the reality is if we just go to the CDC website, we get a wealth of information.
[01:44:21.959 --> 01:44:22.940]  You probably remember this.
[01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:33.168]  I have been talking since 1994, explaining that when viruses come into the body, they will produce an inflammation and blood clotting or inflammatory response.
[01:44:33.608 --> 01:44:36.911]  And that's exactly what SARS-CoV-2, this virus, does.
[01:44:37.331 --> 01:44:42.415]  And when you have that inflammation and blood clotting and you don't treat it, you end up with COVID-19.
[01:44:43.914 --> 01:44:52.961]  Now, the CDC has done a great job of showing the excess deaths, and it's one of the pieces of information we discuss in this Crimes Against Humanity Tour.
[01:44:53.562 --> 01:45:10.015]  If you look at when those excess deaths occurred due to inflammation, blood clotting, and prion diseases, as we've talked about with this spike protein, prion diseases like Alzheimer's and other neurologic diseases, they are actually ahead of schedule.
[01:45:10.095 --> 01:45:17.162]   And the excess deaths followed on the heels of masking, And every one of the vaccines that has been given to people.
[01:45:17.962 --> 01:45:24.849]  And if we look at the world data, very clear that the variants, there's 28 variants that yeah, that's a good map.
[01:45:25.609 --> 01:45:41.043]  If the Ukraine did nothing more for the American public, it established that there's over 15 biological weapons labs in the Ukraine, that the United States is helping to pay for eight of which are completely run by the US Department of Defense.
[01:45:41.123 --> 01:45:48.583]   And research has been has come from the Department of Defense
[01:45:48.583 --> 01:45:56.293]   where they have provided experts to DAISAC at EcoHealth and Ralph Baric and
[01:45:56.293 --> 01:46:01.403]   Chisang Lee and University of Wisconsin, Nebraska, Iowa, Texas all over the
[01:46:01.403 --> 01:46:02.983]  United States.
[01:46:02.983 --> 01:46:07.222]   To be clear, it's not Russian propaganda. You reported this, I reported this long
[01:46:07.222 --> 01:46:10.583]   before the Russians did but I've seen the Russian reporting by their Ministry
[01:46:10.956 --> 01:46:11.657]  It's very accurate.
[01:46:12.097 --> 01:46:13.497]  Ukraine biolab update.
[01:46:13.558 --> 01:46:24.803]  Russia implicates Pfizer, Moderna, Merck, Obama, Soros, the Clintons, the Bidens, the Rockefellers, and others from their own documents, and then our media just calls it disinfo, like they called the Hunter Biden thing disinfo.
[01:46:26.703 --> 01:46:27.484]  It's all just right here.
[01:46:29.275 --> 01:46:35.919]  If you look at when gain of function was clamped down in the United States, that's the time that we really started to escalate it over in the Ukraine.
[01:46:36.399 --> 01:46:45.244]  It was just another way of continuing the research that they wanted to do outside of the purview of the American public and attempting to just circumvent the entire thing.
[01:46:45.384 --> 01:47:02.209]   If you look at The development of this, if you look at the Pfizer, Moderna, and Janssen vaccines, which are not completely identical, but what they do have that match is the prion domain of the regional binding site that's responsible for these prion diseases.
[01:47:02.629 --> 01:47:05.270]  There's no snake venom in them, and you don't need that.
[01:47:05.390 --> 01:47:09.670]   There's enough harm being done by these vaccines in and of themselves.
[01:47:09.670 --> 01:47:14.989]   And what they have done is they have put pressure on this virus to shift it away
[01:47:14.989 --> 01:47:20.010]   from the Wuhan H1, and then we saw the alpha, the beta, the gamma.
[01:47:20.010 --> 01:47:24.069]   We've seen lambda and mu, and I know these are all Greek letters to people because
[01:47:24.069 --> 01:47:28.069]   they are Greek letters, three delta variants and five Omicron variants.
[01:47:28.089 --> 01:47:35.951]  And we're going to continue to see these variants pop up as continued pressure gets placed on these by the vaccine.
[01:47:36.091 --> 01:47:53.344]   If you really look at the world data, not my data, the world data as people are collecting and actually looking at who's been vaccinated, who hasn't, and who's getting thicker, what we're seeing Are the unvaccinated having the least problems and the vaccinated people having the most problems?
[01:47:53.804 --> 01:48:01.469]  And what we're not seeing is the unvaccinated come down now with these massive inflammation and blood clotting and prion diseases.
[01:48:02.109 --> 01:48:10.481]   What we're seeing are people that are By the greatest percentage, over 45 white people coming down with these diseases.
[01:48:10.541 --> 01:48:17.104]  It doesn't mean other people aren't being affected, but if we really look at the data objectively, this is what's happening.
[01:48:17.284 --> 01:48:22.126]  So it looks like the so-called vaccine is designed to get rid of the boomers before they collect their Social Security check.
[01:48:23.866 --> 01:48:30.889]  And or become confident enough in the information that they want to come back and say, wait a minute, this is not what I agreed to.
[01:48:30.949 --> 01:48:36.792]  You know, my parents and grandparents said they wanted a better life for their children, including me.
[01:48:37.192 --> 01:48:40.753]  And I've looked at my children and said, I want a better life for you.
[01:48:40.793 --> 01:48:43.775]  And the only way that happens is if the American public stands up.
[01:48:43.855 --> 01:48:52.299]   Look, if Anthony Fauci and the rest of these people can go into a court of law and say, we didn't do anything wrong, Then I'm all for that.
[01:48:52.379 --> 01:49:02.447]  But the way that this works is that a grand jury convenes by a state attorney general and we the people then get to sit there and hear the explanation.
[01:49:03.167 --> 01:49:09.592]  And this attitude that they don't have to take and be held accountable to the American people just doesn't cut it.
[01:49:09.953 --> 01:49:20.421]   For the American people that are recognizing their responsibility to their children and their grandchildren, it's time to have I totally agree.
[01:49:20.501 --> 01:49:22.243]  A lot of people are coming to this tour.
[01:49:22.603 --> 01:49:23.844]  How do folks find out about the tour?
[01:49:23.924 --> 01:49:30.050]  And just explain, you guys are using this as a public place to put on the evidence that Fauci and others need to be indicted.
[01:49:30.090 --> 01:49:32.011]  And then let's see if they can defend themselves in court.
[01:49:32.332 --> 01:49:37.837]  But I mean, they brought out an illegal, untested thing that they had secretly tested, knew what it would do.
[01:49:38.217 --> 01:49:40.879]  Even the CDC's own document, as you know, in October of 2021, excuse me, 2000.
[01:49:43.822 --> 01:49:47.822]   said we know it's going to cause thrombosis, we know it's going to cause blood clots,
[01:49:47.822 --> 01:49:50.462]   we know it's going to do this. So they knew good and damn well what they were doing.
[01:49:50.462 --> 01:49:58.942]   Look, the CDC had me over in Greece in 2005, specifically at their request for me to present
[01:49:58.942 --> 01:50:04.860]   a conference in 2005 in Greece on the theory that I laid out this inflammation of blood clotting
[01:50:04.860 --> 01:50:07.422]  and the way that this could be measured inside the body.
[01:50:07.585 --> 01:50:13.967]  So the CDC was completely up to speed on this and they invited me to go over there and give this presentation.
[01:50:14.348 --> 01:50:16.428]  They can't pretend they're unaware of it.
[01:50:16.929 --> 01:50:20.590]  You know this stuff has been out you know that that theory was presented originally in 1994.
[01:50:23.462 --> 01:50:36.156]  My work looking at this inflammation and heart disease was on the same receptor site that Chu Zhengli was working on with HIV glycoprotein 120 when she put that into SARS-CoV-1 to make it more infective.
[01:50:36.276 --> 01:50:38.418]  These people have been working on this for decades.
[01:50:38.818 --> 01:50:49.619]   They've been tracking those of us who've been working on it for decades, although I certainly wasn't working on a like heart disease and high blood pressure
[01:50:49.619 --> 01:50:53.059]  and diabetes and cancer and strokes and the rest of it.
[01:50:53.059 --> 01:50:58.539]   But they know that this is a consequence of this type of infectious agent.
[01:50:58.539 --> 01:51:01.159]  And they've been putting it into people.
[01:51:01.159 --> 01:51:05.979]   They've been encouraging people to take vaccines that when you look at the emergency use authorization
[01:51:05.979 --> 01:51:11.899]   documents show no statistically significant benefit for the people being vaccinated.
[01:51:11.899 --> 01:51:12.739]  That's right.
[01:51:12.739 --> 01:51:14.499]   So stay there, Dr. Fleming, we got longer segments coming up
[01:51:14.499 --> 01:51:17.098]  and I wanna continue to walk through all this with you.
[01:51:16.608 --> 01:51:23.853]  And I know you're a scientist, you just stick with what you can prove now, but just as a citizen, as a person, obviously the whole thing is premeditated in my view.
[01:51:24.213 --> 01:51:24.954]  We can see that.
[01:51:25.534 --> 01:51:28.977]  What's coming next if we extrapolate that out logically?
[01:51:29.357 --> 01:51:30.678]  What do we expect in their plan?
[01:51:30.698 --> 01:51:31.859]  How's their plan gone?
[01:51:32.299 --> 01:51:33.420]  How big's the awakening?
[01:51:34.421 --> 01:51:38.164]  They seem to be really freaked out right now, seems like things didn't go too well for them.
[01:51:39.004 --> 01:51:40.325]  Am I being too hopeful there?
[01:51:40.345 --> 01:51:54.189]  I want to ask your real expert opinion on all this, but not just your medical opinion, your legal opinion, and your basic citizen's opinion as a person, as a private person, what you really think is going on, so your personal opinion.
[01:51:54.409 --> 01:51:55.610]  We'll be right back with Dr. Fleming.
[01:51:55.630 --> 01:51:57.210]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[01:51:57.230 --> 01:51:57.650]  Stay with us.
[01:51:59.551 --> 01:52:02.592]  And Dr. Richard M. Fleming of FlemingMethod.com.
[01:52:04.298 --> 01:52:08.403]  What an illustrative article just came out from USA Today today.
[01:52:08.904 --> 01:52:12.768]  North Korea confirms first COVID outbreak.
[01:52:13.209 --> 01:52:14.611]  Kim orders lockdown.
[01:52:16.249 --> 01:52:24.557]  So undoubtedly the worst dictator in the world following suit with the US and China and everybody in Australia and doing what they've done.
[01:52:25.257 --> 01:52:28.420]  This is all a giant planetary martial law drill.
[01:52:29.521 --> 01:52:30.822]  It's incredibly dangerous.
[01:52:30.862 --> 01:52:36.367]  Dr. Fleming, continuing here, we'll get into all the latest science and the variance of the numbers.
[01:52:37.068 --> 01:52:54.338]  Well, people really need to know this fact, but just as a man, not as a legal scholar or a medical doctor, watching this whole thing, witnessing the censorship, witnessing them lying, blocking therapeutics, big picture, is this not a giant power grab biomedical system?
[01:52:54.438 --> 01:52:56.559]  Is this not what they talk about with depopulation?
[01:52:56.619 --> 01:53:03.203]  Is this not, in my view, a beta test, as Bill Gates is in the news saying, for something far worse?
[01:53:03.603 --> 01:53:04.684]  Bill Gates on COVID.
[01:53:05.606 --> 01:53:09.888]  I don't want to be a voice of doom and gloom, but the worst is coming.
[01:53:10.989 --> 01:53:12.630]  It just goes on and on.
[01:53:12.890 --> 01:53:19.673]  These people are very predictable and it's like for so long the public's been asleep or blind.
[01:53:20.033 --> 01:53:22.995]  Now I'm seeing awakening, but is it enough and what do we need to do?
[01:53:23.015 --> 01:53:27.237]  So just your 35,000 foot view on what's happening, what you see coming.
[01:53:28.772 --> 01:53:32.381]  Look, it's enough if the American public will actually take action.
[01:53:32.440 --> 01:53:38.940]   You cannot just expect someone like you or myself to turn the tide on this.
[01:53:38.940 --> 01:53:44.380]   This is a requirement of the American people to let their elected officials at this point in time,
[01:53:44.380 --> 01:53:48.541]   particularly their state attorney generals know that they want action taken
[01:53:48.541 --> 01:53:50.740]  and they want indictments on these people.
[01:53:50.740 --> 01:53:52.619]  Anything else is not going to work.
[01:53:52.619 --> 01:54:01.300]   If people are going to sit back and not participate in this, we're gonna get exactly what the lady was told
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:07.220]   when she approached Benjamin Franklin and said, "What form of government have you given us?"
[01:54:07.032 --> 01:54:09.654]  And he said, a republic, madam, if you can keep it.
[01:54:09.674 --> 01:54:12.957]  And the question is if the people are willing to get up and keep it.
[01:54:13.037 --> 01:54:20.102]  And it's really time that the American citizens get up and start doing their job as American citizens and as parents.
[01:54:20.542 --> 01:54:22.384]  You know, you want to know my personal opinion?
[01:54:22.424 --> 01:54:38.589]   My personal opinion comes to you as a father, not As an individual, I have an obligation to my children, and this entire episode of what we're dealing with, with these individuals, has to do with our children and our grandchildren.
[01:54:38.869 --> 01:54:46.792]  That's who the commitment is, because our children and our grandchildren are eventually going to judge us for what we did or did not do during these times.
[01:54:47.312 --> 01:54:58.675]   And Bill Gates has, you know, this nice vested interest now, he's with the World Health Organization, and we've gotten this question now asked at the conference, "What about this World Health
[01:54:58.675 --> 01:55:03.564]   Organization and the U.S. involvement with the treaty?" It's really important when people look at
[01:55:03.564 --> 01:55:08.984]   that type of information that you go get your facts because when we originally signed
[01:55:08.984 --> 01:55:13.814]   that and it wasn't done by the entire, it wasn't ratified by the entire Congress,
[01:55:14.002 --> 01:55:31.649]  That document, when it was signed in the 1940s, under the last part of it, I think it was Article 6 of it, specifically stated that nothing in the agreement to be part of the World Health Organization in any way gave the World Health Organization power over the American people.
[01:55:31.709 --> 01:55:32.889]  So that's what was signed.
[01:55:33.797 --> 01:55:39.081]  And they're going to try to manipulate this to allow the WHO to take over control of the American citizens.
[01:55:39.141 --> 01:55:40.542]  And that's not the authority.
[01:55:40.562 --> 01:55:41.683]  Sorry to interrupt.
[01:55:41.703 --> 01:55:42.544]  That's my next question.
[01:55:42.584 --> 01:55:43.725]  I forgot to get to that early on.
[01:55:43.765 --> 01:55:44.465]  I should have brought it up front.
[01:55:44.826 --> 01:55:51.771]  What do you make of this new treaty they're writing in secret when they're meeting from the 23rd to the 28th in Switzerland?
[01:55:52.171 --> 01:56:01.679]  And then the leaks of it admit it's a total takeover with big pharma in control of the UN and nation states ceding any authority they had left to these people.
[01:56:03.061 --> 01:56:21.915]   I am going to send you when we're done for you to link on your program the three pages not even a full three page document that very specifically states that nothing in the agreement of the United States be part of the World Health Organization ...entitles the World Health Organization to take control of the United States.
[01:56:21.955 --> 01:56:28.782]  They have no authority based upon this original document, and it's never been relinquished to them.
[01:56:28.922 --> 01:56:29.342]  Absolutely.
[01:56:29.362 --> 01:56:34.447]  It was kind of the CDC when it announced they controlled all rents in the country, and the Supreme Court said no.
[01:56:34.848 --> 01:56:37.510]  This is power grabbing at the federal level, the international level.
[01:56:37.530 --> 01:56:38.932]  It's all just a giant power grab.
[01:56:40.202 --> 01:56:46.625]  Yeah, and I guess we'll do Constitutional Law 101 here, as both a JD and a father.
[01:56:47.225 --> 01:56:54.048]  The federal government of the United States is in an agreement with the states, and that's called the United States Constitution.
[01:56:54.108 --> 01:57:00.330]  And Article 10 states that anything not specifically given to the power of the federal government in the U.S.
[01:57:00.370 --> 01:57:02.951]  Constitution belongs to the state and the people.
[01:57:03.911 --> 01:57:11.213]   States cannot have authority that they don't get granted to them Unless the people give them that power.
[01:57:11.674 --> 01:57:26.457]  And nobody, no individual citizen of the United States has the power or authority to tell anybody else that they have to mask up, that they have to be vaccinated, that they can be individually locked down, or anything else.
[01:57:26.797 --> 01:57:28.177]  The people don't have that power.
[01:57:28.217 --> 01:57:29.557]  They cannot give it to the states.
[01:57:29.637 --> 01:57:35.394]   If the states don't have that power, they cannot give it to the United It's in violation of the U.S.
[01:57:35.434 --> 01:57:36.195]  Constitution.
[01:57:36.675 --> 01:57:37.655]  And that W.H.O.
[01:57:37.755 --> 01:57:46.477]  treaty specifically states that we signed in the 1940s, that it does not, does not give authority to the W.H.O.
[01:57:46.777 --> 01:57:48.137]  over the American people.
[01:57:48.217 --> 01:57:50.038]  And Dr. Fleming, should we expand on that?
[01:57:50.178 --> 01:57:53.918]  We should expand on that and point out, you're a lawyer, but anybody can look this up.
[01:57:54.219 --> 01:57:55.939]  The Tenth Amendment is what you're talking about.
[01:57:56.499 --> 01:58:09.307]  We're at states that all power is reserved to the people, and it just expands from there that we're a republic, not a democracy, and we have Elizabeth Warren saying, we need the majority today, she said, to be able to make the minority do things.
[01:58:09.387 --> 01:58:19.973]  No, there's a codified group of rights, and all their rights are reserved to us, they're inalienable, and it's natural law, it's common law, and this is just nothing but pure tyranny.
[01:58:21.533 --> 01:58:22.053]  Yeah, it is.
[01:58:22.233 --> 01:58:30.779]  It's a power grab that people in positions of, they have forgotten that they are elected by the people to do the will of the people.
[01:58:30.819 --> 01:58:32.120]  That's called a republic.
[01:58:32.620 --> 01:58:35.622]  You know, a democracy is where every individual is doing something.
[01:58:35.662 --> 01:58:37.644]  And the American people have gotten so lax.
[01:58:38.524 --> 01:58:46.108]  I know this sounds critical, but they've gotten so lax on allowing the federal government and presuming that the federal government will just simply do what's right.
[01:58:46.508 --> 01:58:49.390]  Well, there are good people and there are bad people on this planet.
[01:58:49.430 --> 01:58:58.835]  Just like there's good politicians and bad politicians, there's good doctors, there's bad doctors, there's good lawyers, there's bad lawyers, there's good judges, and there are crappy judges.
[01:58:59.895 --> 01:59:00.876]  And what is globalism?
[01:59:00.936 --> 01:59:08.580]  It's a bunch of corporate and governmental chiefs getting together and transferring national and independent and local and individual power unto themselves.
[01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:14.723]  That's what globalism of the new world order is, is a giant transference of power to multinational corporations through the UN.
[01:59:16.344 --> 01:59:17.745]  They do not have this authority.
[01:59:18.025 --> 01:59:19.886]  I haven't granted them this authority.
[01:59:19.926 --> 01:59:29.491]  The people that are ticked off, if you don't stand up and do something about it, you are granting them this authority, and your children and grandchildren are going to be the ones that suffer.
[01:59:30.031 --> 01:59:33.493]  And Crimes Against Humanity is not just myself.
[01:59:33.533 --> 01:59:34.974]  There are four people presenting.
[01:59:34.994 --> 01:59:41.617]  There is Patrick Woods, who is laying out decades worth of material for you to see what's been going on financially.
[01:59:41.957 --> 01:59:48.362]  There is Judy Mickiewicz, who can tell you and provide personal experience about the behavior of Anthony Fauci.
[01:59:48.783 --> 01:59:57.850]  There is Rainer Fumich, who has come over here to attempt to provide civil litigation and to listen to people week after week and give an opportunity to hear the truth.
[01:59:58.271 --> 02:00:20.667]   And there is myself, who is presenting the history of biological weapons, this gain of function, And I know you guys behind the scenes are getting a lot of pressure and a lot of attacks.
[02:00:20.707 --> 02:00:22.389]  We can only be praying for you.
[02:00:22.689 --> 02:00:26.511]  Do we just go to your excellent website, FlemingMethod.com, to find the conference?
[02:00:26.551 --> 02:00:27.552]  Or where do we find the conference?
[02:00:29.088 --> 02:00:35.955]  So you can find it on my website, but go to crimesagainsthumanitytour.com.
[02:00:36.015 --> 02:00:37.536]  Put it all together as one word.
[02:00:38.037 --> 02:00:40.439]  Crimesagainsthumanitytour.com.
[02:00:40.519 --> 02:00:44.883]  And like yourself, they have been doing an outstanding job of trying to censor us.
[02:00:45.344 --> 02:00:59.300]   When people come, they tell us they just heard about it at the last minute, but every one of these in-live events Leaves people more charged and more determined and we have a number of people that are leaving these events going to their attorney generals.
[02:01:00.220 --> 02:01:00.980]  Activating them.
[02:01:01.540 --> 02:01:03.241]  The attorney generals have a choice.
[02:01:03.541 --> 02:01:07.782]  They can, doesn't matter which side they're on, they can say, look, I'm just doing my job.
[02:01:07.842 --> 02:01:09.022]  I turned it over to a grand jury.
[02:01:09.082 --> 02:01:11.982]  If the grand jury didn't do anything, then that's on the grand jury.
[02:01:12.042 --> 02:01:15.343]  If the grand jury says indict, then they have to take it forward.
[02:01:15.383 --> 02:01:17.744]  Dr. Fleming, you guys are doing God's work.
[02:01:17.944 --> 02:01:20.464]  And I know some of the behind the scenes stuff, you guys have a lot of courage.
[02:01:21.384 --> 02:01:22.545]  Stand with us, folks.
[02:01:22.565 --> 02:01:23.545]  We are fighting together.
[02:01:23.585 --> 02:01:24.385]  We'll be right back.
[02:01:24.805 --> 02:01:25.845]  Infowars.com.
[02:01:25.865 --> 02:01:26.885]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:01:26.945 --> 02:01:27.686]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:01:27.806 --> 02:01:29.126]  We've got great products to keep us on air.
[02:01:30.049 --> 02:01:36.633]  You know, I was just sitting here during the break listening to a radio ad with Owen Schroer's voice on it, host of The War Room, good friend of mine, been here six years now.
[02:01:37.673 --> 02:01:44.997]  And now he has been indicted, they're trying to put him in jail for years, for being with me at the Capitol trying to stop people going in on January 6th.
[02:01:45.017 --> 02:01:48.399]  It's all over the news, they've got grand juries out trying to indict me.
[02:01:49.179 --> 02:01:53.442]  It's in the news, this new FBI whistleblower that they've been targeting journalists and others.
[02:01:55.111 --> 02:02:04.119]  Nobody's fighting harder against these people and having more key guests on and breaking more news than InfoWars and nobody's reaching audiences this big consistently with this information.
[02:02:04.579 --> 02:02:07.481]  Joe Rogan has a bigger audience now in many ways.
[02:02:07.702 --> 02:02:08.822]  That's great, good friend of mine.
[02:02:09.303 --> 02:02:12.506]  Just a few dozen hardcore interviews with him changed the world.
[02:02:13.146 --> 02:02:14.686]  This is having a huge effect.
[02:02:14.727 --> 02:02:17.807]  So thank you all for your support and your word of mouth and your prayer.
[02:02:17.987 --> 02:02:22.489]  And go to InfoWarsTore.com because we are right in the black, treading water.

[02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:31.091]  I made the decision to keep going and not have layoffs and just basically run on empty.
[02:02:31.392 --> 02:02:32.452]  Couldn't run on negative.
[02:02:33.052 --> 02:02:35.153]  So keep us in the black, plus get products you need.

[02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:21.522]  Some of their big bags and things aren't, but a lot of this is made.
[02:03:21.842 --> 02:03:22.763]  This is made in America.

[02:03:38.948 --> 02:03:41.349]  All right, Dr. Fleming, you've done an amazing job here today.
[02:03:41.829 --> 02:03:43.369]  We got about eight minutes left with you.
[02:03:43.709 --> 02:03:47.871]  I've got a lot of questions, obviously, to cover, but what else is front and center on your radar?
[02:03:47.911 --> 02:03:48.451]  People need to know.
[02:03:50.003 --> 02:03:53.184]  Well, front and center is the Crimes Against Humanity Tour.
[02:03:53.244 --> 02:03:55.725]  This is the way that we want people to come.
[02:03:55.905 --> 02:03:57.145]  We want them to participate.
[02:03:57.205 --> 02:03:59.606]  We've got this coming Saturday in Phoenix.
[02:03:59.766 --> 02:04:04.908]  On the 21st of May, we're in Houston, back where I trained as a cardiologist.
[02:04:04.988 --> 02:04:06.989]  On the 28th of May, we're in Minneapolis.
[02:04:07.069 --> 02:04:08.950]  On the 4th of June, we're in Atlantic City.
[02:04:09.530 --> 02:04:12.931]  On the 11th of June, we're back home in Dallas, my home.
[02:04:14.131 --> 02:04:25.035]  And on the 19th of June we're in Tampa where I've encouraged Dr. Anthony Fauci to come and do a live debate or discussion to defend what he's done with Gain of Function.
[02:04:26.936 --> 02:04:39.320]  Front and Center is getting people to these events to learn what they need to hear, to give them the knowledge and information to move forward with this, to encourage them to go to their state attorney generals.
[02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:41.401]  It doesn't matter which state you're in.
[02:04:42.535 --> 02:04:44.896]  These attorney generals need to be brought to task.
[02:04:45.316 --> 02:04:52.739]  If there's enough telephone calls, enough emails, enough letters sent to them, they'll turn it over to a grand jury and let the grand jury decide.
[02:04:52.779 --> 02:05:03.283]  And I guarantee you every one of these attorney generals will be able to benefit from being able to look at people and say they were doing their job that they were elected to do or appointed to do.
[02:05:03.783 --> 02:05:07.104]  And that's part of being an American at this point in time.
[02:05:07.524 --> 02:05:08.645]  I think it's really sad.
[02:05:09.750 --> 02:05:18.713]  That we have better information coming from Walgreens right now than we do NIAID or the CDC or the FDA.
[02:05:19.213 --> 02:05:19.633]  That's right.
[02:05:19.673 --> 02:05:20.814]  In fact, I wanted to get to that.
[02:05:20.854 --> 02:05:24.215]  Let's drill into that more because that mirrors the stuff out of Israel and out of Europe.
[02:05:24.855 --> 02:05:27.236]  But they keep lying and saying, oh, no, you get protection.
[02:05:27.596 --> 02:05:35.198]  But from what I've been seeing in many statistics, you have higher hospitalization death rates, especially after a few months with all these different injections.
[02:05:35.218 --> 02:05:36.779]  What's really happening, Dr. Fleming?
[02:05:37.938 --> 02:05:42.842]  Look, we're showing it in the presentation that we're doing on the Scrams Against Humanity Tour.
[02:05:42.902 --> 02:05:51.268]  If you look at what happens to people when they receive the Pfizer and Moderna and Janssen vaccines, their immune system is suppressed.
[02:05:51.900 --> 02:05:55.843]  There is a reduction in the ability to make interferon, which interferes with viruses.
[02:05:56.103 --> 02:06:03.769]  There is the reduction in T lymphocytes, which are the first part of your immune system that help fight off viruses or bacterial infection.
[02:06:04.209 --> 02:06:11.374]  There is a reduction in T helper 2 cells, which are critical for making antibiotics or antibodies by your body.
[02:06:11.934 --> 02:06:45.021]   And when people are given these vaccine shots and then given another vaccine like influenza, they cannot make You said that two years ago, and even mainline scientists have said injecting people during a coronavirus outbreak with a vaccine is guaranteed to create a lot of stuff that's even worse, whereas in natural behavior it would become less worse.
[02:06:46.553 --> 02:06:53.719]  And the reality is that when you have natural person-to-person behavior, you're making antibodies and T-cell response to all of the virus.
[02:06:54.059 --> 02:06:59.504]  And it turns out that our best immune response to the coronavirus is the nucleocapsid.
[02:06:59.844 --> 02:07:01.466]  And what do we have in the vaccines?
[02:07:02.006 --> 02:07:04.468]  Not the nucleocapsid, the spike protein.
[02:07:04.769 --> 02:07:07.911]  And the spike protein of the original virus, Wuhan HU1.
[02:07:09.012 --> 02:07:12.556]  I mean, this was the most, as far as I'm concerned, a poorly thought out.
[02:07:12.616 --> 02:07:19.423]  There's the chart where you can see when the masking began and the vaccines began, that's when the excess deaths occurred.
[02:07:19.764 --> 02:07:20.845]  It wasn't before that.
[02:07:21.325 --> 02:07:24.088]  And their inflammation and blood clotting and their private disease.
[02:07:24.108 --> 02:07:24.949]  You talk about smoking guns.
[02:07:24.989 --> 02:07:26.751]  Spend some more time on this for TV viewers.
[02:07:27.131 --> 02:07:30.475]  Radio listeners can find it at FlemingMethod.com, but this is from their own data.
[02:07:30.495 --> 02:07:31.276]  This is smoking gun.
[02:07:32.262 --> 02:07:34.185]  Yeah, this is CDC data.
[02:07:34.465 --> 02:07:43.737]  Now, all I did, the green part is the expected deaths that we see year after year after year, and the blue bars are the excess deaths that have occurred over the course of time.
[02:07:43.917 --> 02:07:48.303]  All I did was take their data and say, well, isn't it interesting?
[02:07:48.383 --> 02:07:49.825]  This is when masking began.
[02:07:49.845 --> 02:07:55.365]   This is when Pfizer and Moderna and Janssen and the boosters first started. And when you look at
[02:07:55.365 --> 02:08:00.725]   this, in every one of these instances, with the possible exception of Janssen, which started to
[02:08:00.725 --> 02:08:05.524]   see a slight decrease, but we know it produces lots of blood clotting. And with the boosters,
[02:08:05.524 --> 02:08:12.724]   you see the excess deaths going up. And when you go a few slides into the presentation that we're
[02:08:12.724 --> 02:08:18.564]   doing further, these deaths are not due to a pneumonia, which is what you would expect from
[02:08:18.564 --> 02:08:20.564]  SARS virus.
[02:08:20.346 --> 02:08:23.768]  They are due to, there you go, those are the absolute numbers.
[02:08:23.828 --> 02:08:41.684]   You see at the very top, minuscule amounts of pneumonias, but what you're seeing are the inflammatory body diseases of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, Cancer, strokes, and amazingly enough you see the neurologic diseases, the brain diseases, Alzheimer's.
[02:08:41.764 --> 02:08:48.871]  These are the absolute numbers of excess deaths following on the heels of masking and these vaccines.
[02:08:49.652 --> 02:09:04.317]   The vaccines showed no statistical reduction in the EUA document of reducing COVID and the absolute data now shows us That the consequence of this vaccine program has been the production of every one of these diseases.
[02:09:04.397 --> 02:09:08.341]  These are the excess deaths being tallied by the CDC.
[02:09:08.781 --> 02:09:21.292]  And I know they weren't trying to give me information to use in a presentation, a keynote presentation like this, but they did their job and they provided beautiful data that shows the consequence of these vaccines and mass scans.
[02:09:21.312 --> 02:09:23.734]  And the insurance companies are showing the same numbers.
[02:09:23.814 --> 02:09:24.735]  It's coming out everywhere.
[02:09:26.276 --> 02:09:29.919]  I mean, are they just thinking this is going to be hidden in plain view and they're never going to get brought to justice?
[02:09:30.359 --> 02:09:32.221]  This is a giant crime against humanity.
[02:09:32.261 --> 02:09:33.261]  This is Hitler level.
[02:09:34.462 --> 02:09:40.467]  This is worse than Hitler because Hitler had to relegate himself to the people that were in prison or war camp.
[02:09:40.907 --> 02:09:44.750]  These folks got away with doing this on the entire bloody planet.
[02:09:44.810 --> 02:09:47.512]  And now they're coming after under five children.
[02:09:49.284 --> 02:09:59.886]  Oh, and what about, in closing, what about all this so-called acute hepatitis popping up in young people that have taken the shot, and a lot of scientists pointing at the injections?
[02:10:01.767 --> 02:10:05.107]  Take a look and see what the virus is that causes this hepatitis.
[02:10:05.507 --> 02:10:06.408]  It's adenovirus.
[02:10:06.928 --> 02:10:16.590]  And what is the vector, the virus vector being used for the Janssen, you know, what people call Johnson & Johnson, and the AstraZeneca vaccines?
[02:10:16.610 --> 02:10:18.070]  That's adenovirus.
[02:10:18.630 --> 02:10:26.695]  The very viral vector being used for the Janssen, the AstraZeneca, or is the virus that's causing these hepatitis cases?
[02:10:26.895 --> 02:10:28.677]  And you've been vindicated again.
[02:10:28.717 --> 02:10:33.239]  The warning of blood clots two years ago, now J&J's been pulled for most people over blood clots.
[02:10:33.540 --> 02:10:39.363]  So we have now been vindicated, but we're censored because we're right, and then Bill Gates is pushed because he's behind it all.
[02:10:39.643 --> 02:10:41.244]  Dr. Fleming, thank you so much.
[02:10:41.385 --> 02:10:44.827]  One more time, the website, people to come to this incredibly important tour.
[02:10:46.576 --> 02:10:51.319]  Crimes Against Humanity Tour, all one word, dot com.
[02:10:51.779 --> 02:11:06.787]  They can go there, they can sign up to come to an event, they can donate if that's what they want to do, and they can follow along as we give bits and pieces, and the Tampa event will be live streamed for people who can't get there otherwise, and we're going to go beyond Tampa.
[02:11:07.507 --> 02:11:10.108]  That's right, and what you're doing as medical doctors is changing the world.
[02:11:10.168 --> 02:11:10.869]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:11:13.148 --> 02:11:14.448]  Folks, we're swinging for the fences.
[02:11:14.508 --> 02:11:18.451]  We're fighting as hard as we can, taking on the most evil people on earth, because it's the right thing to do.
[02:11:18.871 --> 02:11:21.993]  But we can't do it without your prayer, financial support, and word of mouth.
[02:11:22.293 --> 02:11:23.753]  So again, I'm leaning on you.
[02:11:23.794 --> 02:11:24.474]  You're leaning on me.
[02:11:24.554 --> 02:11:26.015]  We're in the thick of the fights here now.
[02:11:26.335 --> 02:11:27.556]  We're inside the New World Order.
[02:11:27.916 --> 02:11:34.840]  And now is the time to not just say Alex Jones was right, or you were right, or Fleming was right, but to spread the word like our lives depend on it.
[02:11:34.880 --> 02:11:40.023]  This powerful interview that was just live, or still live, will be archived at Bandot Video in the next few hours.
[02:11:40.763 --> 02:11:42.644]  Share it as well if you're watching it as an archive.
[02:11:43.004 --> 02:11:47.727]  Share it, and then tell those that see it to share it, and them to share it, and them to share it, and them to share it, and them to share it.
[02:11:48.047 --> 02:11:50.008]  And that causes the chain reaction.
[02:11:50.288 --> 02:11:51.629]  Don't just tell folks, hey, watch this.
[02:11:51.669 --> 02:11:52.169]  Tell them, hey.
[02:11:52.530 --> 02:11:53.810]  Then tell others to watch it.
[02:11:53.830 --> 02:11:54.511]  Tell them to watch it.
[02:11:54.551 --> 02:12:14.390]  We'll be right back with Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:12:14.833 --> 02:12:23.418]  And most iodine that you get from different foods is bound to other minerals or other compounds, so it's not absorbable in the body.
[02:12:23.679 --> 02:12:25.700]  And that's why iodine deficiency is such a huge issue.
[02:12:26.100 --> 02:12:30.603]  We have the purest, cleanest, best iodine in the world from deep-earth crystals more than 7,000 feet deep.
[02:12:32.444 --> 02:12:35.923]   X2 is an amazing product and it has been sold out for months and months and months.

[02:13:24.644 --> 02:13:26.923]  It is the Summit News Hour for the 12th of May.
[02:13:26.940 --> 02:13:31.383]  Tonne of news to get into this hour.
[02:13:31.503 --> 02:13:34.225]  I'm going to go big on the truth about Nina Jankowicz.
[02:13:34.285 --> 02:13:39.368]  This is the new Ministry of Truth Czar for the Biden administration.
[02:13:39.408 --> 02:13:47.894]  There's a lot of information that's come out over the past week or two about her role, about her history, and even more has come out today.
[02:13:48.624 --> 02:13:56.969]  Forget her wanting to edit your tweets, I've got new information on Big Sister coming up in the next segment.
[02:13:57.710 --> 02:14:03.474]  We're also going to talk about TikTok now censoring viral videos, which are basically cat videos, cat memes.
[02:14:04.034 --> 02:14:05.375]  Oh my god, so dangerous!
[02:14:06.296 --> 02:14:12.099]  Which point out inconsistencies in the Amber Heard Johnny Depp trial testimony.
[02:14:12.900 --> 02:14:20.685]   And of course why this happened is because Rolling Stone Magazine wrote an article saying that these cat memes were gross and demoralizing.
[02:14:20.725 --> 02:14:38.420]  They wrote to TikTok and said you need to start censoring all this content and they doffed the cap and immediately started deleting videos, some of which had 14 million views and were removed at the behest of this legacy media outrage campaign.
[02:14:39.381 --> 02:14:41.903]   Of course the Takeover of Twitter.
[02:14:41.923 --> 02:14:44.665]  The purchase of Twitter by Elon Musk draws nearer.
[02:14:45.225 --> 02:14:53.851]  I noticed today the mainstream media is panicking and saying, oh he could still withdraw and pay a billion in compensation fees and it might not happen.
[02:14:54.312 --> 02:14:55.212]  It's gonna happen.
[02:14:55.472 --> 02:15:18.015]   They're still panicking and that's why literally days after they hired this Nina Jankowicz, disinformation czar who has a history replete with pushing actual disinformation, Because they want to transfer out of social media companies being beholden to censoring content and put that power directly into the hands of government.
[02:15:18.655 --> 02:15:28.981]  And in fact earlier today there were top people who have been with Twitter for seven years announcing on Twitter that they're going to be stepping down here shortly.
[02:15:29.461 --> 02:15:35.872]   And when you look at the people who are replacing them they are To say for sure, more pro-free speech.
[02:15:35.912 --> 02:15:37.232]  So we're going to get into that as well.
[02:15:38.132 --> 02:15:51.195]  We're going to get into a screeching pro-mask rant by a Broadway star, Patti LuPone, who launched an angry rant at an audience member during a Q&A session.
[02:15:51.215 --> 02:15:53.256]  We'll point out the hypocrisy behind that.
[02:15:54.187 --> 02:16:08.832]  The lockdown advocates, the people who religiously pushed for lockdowns last summer, last winter, are now leaving the sinking ship, the sinking ship that is the narrative of lockdowns being necessary and good for society.
[02:16:08.852 --> 02:16:15.955]  We're also going to talk about this mysterious hepatitis outbreak in Ireland, in England, in numerous countries across the world.
[02:16:16.886 --> 02:16:21.368]  And the mainstream media is just professing absolute ignorance as to the cause of it.
[02:16:21.908 --> 02:16:30.311]  Mystery hepatitis illness killing children, requiring them to have urgent liver transplants and they just say we just don't know where it came from.
[02:16:30.891 --> 02:16:35.593]  Of course we know where it came from and we're going to tell you later on in the show.
[02:16:36.533 --> 02:16:43.819]   Of course Stephen Colbert became the latest celebrity to catch Covid once again after being at least triple vaxxed,
[02:16:43.819 --> 02:16:48.509]   maybe even quadruple vaxxed, just like Kamala Harris was. We're going to get into that
[02:16:48.509 --> 02:16:54.029]   as well. Of course he thanked the vaccine for its beneficence and its great efficacy, having caught
[02:16:54.029 --> 02:16:56.079]  Covid after being vaccinated.
[02:16:56.079 --> 02:17:03.280]   Huge comments as well out of Sweden, where of course Donald Trump was ridiculed back in 2017
[02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:09.519]   for warning other European countries that with the lack of integration of huge numbers of
[02:17:09.519 --> 02:17:16.079]   immigrants coming into Europe over the past 10-20 years, there will be mass chaos, riots,
[02:17:16.079 --> 02:17:21.199]   civil war, as we're seeing at least the start of in some European countries at the moment.
[02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:30.150]  Now we have the Prime Minister of Sweden coming out, as Angela Merkel did back in 2010, and saying that mass immigration has failed.
[02:17:30.250 --> 02:17:36.617]  Pretty big comments from somebody who is, to all intents and purposes, a far-left leader.
[02:17:37.233 --> 02:17:47.118]  Also going to get into Prince William praising television producers for inserting propaganda about climate change into their programs to further brainwash the public.
[02:17:47.158 --> 02:17:48.419]  This is the Summit News Hour.
[02:17:48.479 --> 02:17:49.540]  Summit.News.
[02:17:49.680 --> 02:17:50.180]  We'll be back.
[02:17:50.220 --> 02:17:50.740]  Don't go away.
[02:17:51.301 --> 02:17:59.085]  So in both the United States and the United Kingdom we see the regime, the authorities, segueing their internet censorship agenda.
[02:17:59.845 --> 02:18:08.951]  Out of the actual social media platforms being responsible for enforcing that censorship and giving it back into the hands of government.
[02:18:09.932 --> 02:18:35.521]   Of course we have the online safety bill in the United Kingdom which would punish not just illegal information posted online but legal commentary that offends somebody that can be seen to cause quote potential harm And of course, when all the people in control of defining what potential harm is think potential harm includes calling a man a man, then we're going down a very slippery slope.
[02:18:35.581 --> 02:18:43.228]  And we see a similar process in the United States, as I said, days after Elon Musk announced that he would be buying Twitter.
[02:18:43.248 --> 02:18:46.711]   And of course, at first they Couldn't believe it.
[02:18:46.751 --> 02:18:48.392]  They thought someone would intervene.
[02:18:48.772 --> 02:18:55.493]  There was a raft of new investigations into Elon Musk's private business to try and derail him from doing that.
[02:18:55.974 --> 02:19:06.336]  Well, no, it is actually happening, despite the fact they're still saying to this day, I read an article earlier today, oh, Elon Musk could still back out of taking over Twitter, purchasing Twitter.
[02:19:06.756 --> 02:19:10.257]  He'd only have to pay a billion dollars and that's a fraction of his wealth.
[02:19:11.058 --> 02:19:12.658]  Sounds like a big cope to me.
[02:19:13.610 --> 02:19:18.957]  And it is actually going to happen, despite all their prevarications and their hand-wringing.
[02:19:19.377 --> 02:19:21.800]  Elon Musk is set to take over Twitter.
[02:19:22.321 --> 02:19:25.805]  Could happen in weeks, could happen in months, but it is happening.
[02:19:25.845 --> 02:19:30.611]  And of course, you saw yesterday, many people commented on this on Twitter.
[02:19:31.619 --> 02:19:43.468]  A new policy, a new terms of service that Twitter put out saying that they're not responsible for offensive content posted on their platform, that it's the sole responsibility of their users.
[02:19:44.308 --> 02:19:54.416]  Now of course the government's later going to come in if they get their way through this new disinformation framework and impose onerous fines on the likes of Twitter and Facebook.
[02:19:55.217 --> 02:20:02.582]  Or information posted by individual users, which of course will only lead to the censorship ramping up even further.
[02:20:03.042 --> 02:20:07.045]  That's their agenda and that's why they're hiring people like Nina Jankowicz.
[02:20:07.605 --> 02:20:14.590]  This new disinformation unit czar under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Security.
[02:20:15.571 --> 02:20:19.793]   Now if you look into her history, Very interesting history.
[02:20:20.253 --> 02:20:28.200]  She seems to have been a failed theatrical performer who up until about 2019 was basically going nowhere.
[02:20:28.581 --> 02:20:38.910]  Then she was plucked from obscurity by left-wing activist groups and was turned into this new disinformation czar, of course, recently in the past few weeks.
[02:20:39.731 --> 02:20:41.853]  We have a headline here out of Summit News.
[02:20:42.941 --> 02:20:49.043]  Head of Biden's Ministry of Truth previously compared free speech to, quote, fairy dust.
[02:20:49.143 --> 02:20:50.283]  Yes, fairy dust.
[02:20:50.403 --> 02:20:51.724]  Fugazi fugazi.
[02:20:51.804 --> 02:20:52.484]  Fairy dust.
[02:20:53.164 --> 02:20:54.545]  Again, what is fairy dust?
[02:20:55.045 --> 02:20:57.746]  Like fairies, it's non-existent.
[02:20:58.306 --> 02:21:01.807]  So she literally believes that free speech is non-existent.
[02:21:02.547 --> 02:21:08.729]  And this was revealed during testimony about social media censorship in front of the UK Parliament.
[02:21:09.650 --> 02:21:27.850]   Because again, She's been this deep state operative over in Ukraine pushing this geopolitical narrative for the regime for the past few years, and she was cited, heralded, and called to testify by the UK Parliament, which is trying to push this online safety bill.
[02:21:28.510 --> 02:21:35.835]  Which again, as I explained in the previous segment, would ban content which, quote, has the potential to cause harm.
[02:21:36.573 --> 02:21:41.198]  And of course, the potential to cause harm basically means the potential to cause offence.
[02:21:41.979 --> 02:21:57.695]  As you know, basically 75% of the people who use Twitter, and all the blue checkmarks who organise the brigading, the mob attacks, the censorship, are offended by literally everything, including stating biological facts.
[02:21:58.487 --> 02:22:21.099]  Now, during this testimony in front of the UK Parliament, which was back in September last year, but nobody noticed it, we've linked to the transcript in this article, she agrees with the people pushing this online safety censorship bill that, quote, misogyny is a crime, basically an online speech crime, and that it should be banned entirely.
[02:22:22.159 --> 02:22:30.433]   Now, of course, that includes all kinds of categories, not even to mention the fact that Online misogyny directed against women.
[02:22:30.933 --> 02:22:34.617]  Studies have shown 50% of it is posted by other women.
[02:22:35.298 --> 02:22:45.289]  But they try to craft this narrative that there's this big patriarchal conspiracy, abuse and harassment against women on social media, including body shaming and everything like that.
[02:22:45.970 --> 02:22:49.914]  So she agreed with the UK Parliament people and said that that should be banned.
[02:22:50.652 --> 02:22:59.838]  But she also blasted alternative social media platforms for supporting, quote, freedom of expression and fairy dust.
[02:23:00.618 --> 02:23:06.402]  Now in that context, of course, as I mentioned before, fairy dust is non-existent.
[02:23:06.822 --> 02:23:07.623]  It's not a thing.
[02:23:08.083 --> 02:23:08.944]  It doesn't exist.
[02:23:09.564 --> 02:23:34.814]   She's literally suggesting that not only does free speech make Nina Jankowik's, quote, shudder, which also came out a few days ago, She doesn't even believe that it should exist in any form on social media platforms, which is quite frightening given the fact that she's being given all this power to dictate what is offensive content on social media platforms.
[02:23:35.395 --> 02:23:58.241]   As we segue out of the likes of Facebook and Twitter controlling what is determined to be offensive, And into that being decided by authorities, by government, which can impose onerous fines on both social media networks and individuals, and put individuals in prison for espousing views that they deem to be, you know, hate speech.
[02:23:59.401 --> 02:24:10.890]   She also said that government-connected communications regulators such as Ofcom Should, quote, be able to establish the minimum standards that would be applied to all platforms and incur fines.
[02:24:11.470 --> 02:24:17.737]  So again, they're transferring out of social media platforms being liable and saying you are now liable.
[02:24:18.197 --> 02:24:23.443]  They're basically ripping up Section 230, which for a long time the right advocate had been reformed.
[02:24:24.099 --> 02:24:56.547]   But in ripping that up and saying that now social media operations are not platforms, they're actually publishers, the kind of onerous fines which can amount to 10% of the worldwide gross income of these social media platforms, those fines being levered against them for failing to remove offensive content quickly enough, and of course we've already seen laws in Europe already sail through on this subject, Now they want to get that codified and completely the norm for social media censorship.
[02:24:57.449 --> 02:25:10.385]   So it will go from People being banned, people being censored, people being downranked in the algorithm, to people being directly fined and sent to prison for offensive content posted on social media.
[02:25:10.705 --> 02:25:20.494]  The censorship will only get worse because they'll be under threat of losing 10% of their gross income per year if they don't follow these mandates.
[02:25:21.334 --> 02:25:39.594]  Jankiewicz also endorsed empowering governments to demand data on individual users from social media sites for the purpose of implementing further censorship policies and of course identifying them and then having the police investigate their comments and of course destroying anonymity on social media.
[02:25:40.555 --> 02:25:59.248]   She also asserted during this testimony in front of Parliament That social media platforms should utilise algorithms that would, quote, allow us to get around some of the free speech concerns, again, get around free speech concerns, obliterate free speech, by demoting content so fewer people saw it.
[02:25:59.688 --> 02:26:04.210]  Which again, we know happened immediately after the election.
[02:26:04.270 --> 02:26:10.973]  Google, Facebook, they had all these panicky hand-wringing meetings where they said, oh my god, we allowed free speech and Donald Trump won.
[02:26:11.353 --> 02:26:13.014]  We can't ever let this happen again.
[02:26:13.860 --> 02:26:24.324]  Which is then what happened with the ensuing social media ban wave and down ranking shadow banning of people on Twitter, on Facebook, on these other sites.
[02:26:25.624 --> 02:26:48.559]   Now, I'm going to get into the next segment and go on to talk a little bit about Jankowicz's history, which people might not know, and the fact that she has made a career, this czar of Ministry of Truth's disinformation under the Department of Homeland Security, This same woman has made a career out of pushing literal disinformation.
[02:26:49.240 --> 02:26:54.763]  Not only with the Hunter Biden laptop story, but with a lot more which I'm going to get on to.
[02:26:54.783 --> 02:27:04.926]   Then we're going to talk about the Lockdown agenda and how now the raps are indeed fleeing the sinking ship that is the narrative of the lockdown agenda.
[02:27:05.426 --> 02:27:08.827]  They tried to reintroduce measures in England a few weeks ago.
[02:27:08.887 --> 02:27:10.067]  They failed once again.
[02:27:10.627 --> 02:27:20.369]  We've got new World Health Organization figures out of Sweden proving that their lockdown, their refusal to enforce strict mask mandate policies was completely successful.
[02:27:20.409 --> 02:27:24.951]   They have a lower death rate per capita ...than most other European countries.
[02:27:25.291 --> 02:27:30.614]  I'm going to play this video of this Broadway star engaged in a vitriolic pro-mask rant.
[02:27:31.194 --> 02:27:32.314]  Summit.News, we'll be back.
[02:27:32.334 --> 02:27:32.875]  No, go away.
[02:27:33.115 --> 02:27:48.162]  Now, when we talk about this Nina Jankowicz individual, we have to remember, this is the key point, she's vitriolic, she routinely pushes misinformation, disinformation, the likes of which has literally swung elections.
[02:27:48.962 --> 02:28:03.062]   She said that free speech made her shudder, She cited Christopher Steele, the Peagate dossier author, completely fake, completely fraudulent, as an expert on disinformation.
[02:28:03.283 --> 02:28:05.964]  That's literally her disinformation hero.
[02:28:06.764 --> 02:28:21.628]   And of course she called the Hunter Biden laptop story The down-ranking of which, the censorship of which swung the election, many people will argue because it was artificially buried by social media networks right before the election.
[02:28:21.969 --> 02:28:25.332]  It was basically the WikiLeaks in waiting story.
[02:28:25.552 --> 02:28:47.101]   If WikiLeaks had swung the 2016 election with their routine data dumps about Hillary Clinton, This is what would have done the exact same thing for Donald Trump in 2020 if it wasn't censored by social media networks, if major publications like the New York Post weren't locked out of their accounts simply for posting links to this story.
[02:28:47.721 --> 02:29:05.267]  Again, now verified after the election, after the damage can't be done by the New York Times, she promoted the notion that the Hunter Biden laptop story was Russian disinformation, which of course, in and of itself, that is disinformation.
[02:29:05.287 --> 02:29:09.228]  And of course, it came out yesterday, we had the article.
[02:29:10.328 --> 02:29:18.961]   She also appeared in a Zoom call During which two of the participants, I noted, were wearing masks, face masks, in a Zoom call.
[02:29:19.421 --> 02:29:20.562]  Again, they're part of the cult.
[02:29:21.602 --> 02:29:38.288]  That people like her, verified, trustworthy people, with no agenda whatsoever, honestly, they're not hyper-partisan hacks that have been proven wrong and biased on every single previous occasion, should be given the power to edit your tweets.
[02:29:38.328 --> 02:29:40.869]  We have the clip here, let's roll it right now.
[02:29:41.796 --> 02:29:44.480]  And I am eligible for it because I'm verified.
[02:29:45.141 --> 02:29:49.967]  But there are a lot of people who shouldn't be verified who aren't, you know, legit, in my opinion.
[02:29:50.007 --> 02:29:52.851]  I mean, they are real people, but they're not trustworthy.
[02:29:52.911 --> 02:29:54.593]  Anyway, so verified people can...
[02:29:56.916 --> 02:30:05.481]  Essentially start to edit Twitter the same sort of way that Wikipedia is so they can add context to certain tweets.
[02:30:05.921 --> 02:30:33.253]   So just as a easy example, not from any political standpoint, if President Trump were still on Twitter and tweeted a claim about voter fraud, Someone could add context from one of the 60 lawsuits that went through the court or something that an election official in one of the states said, perhaps your own Secretary of State and his news conferences, something like that.
[02:30:33.694 --> 02:30:41.657]  Adding context so that people have a fuller picture rather than just an individual claim on a tweet.
[02:30:44.437 --> 02:30:45.257]  So there you have it.
[02:30:45.337 --> 02:30:48.159]  She literally wants to be given the power to edit your tweets.
[02:30:48.239 --> 02:30:57.743]  This is somebody who, as I will explain shortly, is a narcissist and is a complete control freak, which is why she was given this job.
[02:30:58.383 --> 02:31:07.615]   Of course, Twitter already has the power to slap Manipulated media or misinformation labels on tweets but apparently that's not enough.
[02:31:07.675 --> 02:31:18.718]  She needs to be given the power personally because she's a trusted individual and she's totally neutral and not a hyper-partisan hack at all to be given the power to edit your tweets.
[02:31:19.178 --> 02:31:21.558]  This is control freak behavior.
[02:31:21.578 --> 02:31:23.299]  There's another headline here.
[02:31:24.399 --> 02:31:31.906]   Daily Mail Biden's new disinformations are not removed for apologizing about tweets about masks.
[02:31:32.327 --> 02:31:36.788]  Biden's new disinformations are shared misleading tweets about COVID masks.
[02:31:37.528 --> 02:31:45.210]  Now this was back in the day when they were telling everyone not to wear masks because they didn't stop COVID, which was actually true.
[02:31:45.450 --> 02:31:46.630]  They don't stop COVID.
[02:31:46.850 --> 02:31:49.191]  There's no scientific study that says so.
[02:31:49.631 --> 02:31:55.232]  The virus is 5,000 times smaller than the holes in the friggin' face masks.
[02:31:56.141 --> 02:32:05.003]  But the key takeaway of this is that she is another acolyte of the regime in terms of the lockdown narrative.
[02:32:05.423 --> 02:32:18.306]  She put out a tweet freaking out about the fact that a high school aged couple were on a date and they weren't wearing face masks or they weren't near enough or far enough away from her.
[02:32:18.806 --> 02:32:23.607]  She said, quote, they did not stay six feet away from me despite a wide path.
[02:32:23.767 --> 02:32:24.427]  Oh, my God.
[02:32:26.539 --> 02:32:40.658]  Anyway, long story short, and this is key to her attitude and her belief system, I think we as a country might be too, hmm, free-spirited, to put it diplomatically, to comply with social distancing.
[02:32:41.339 --> 02:32:43.702]  Unless they're forced upon us.
[02:32:44.600 --> 02:32:47.663]  And she goes on to say in this tweet, So FORCE AWAY!
[02:32:48.163 --> 02:32:49.084]  LOCK US DOWN!
[02:32:49.384 --> 02:32:51.386]  People are not taking this seriously.
[02:32:51.546 --> 02:32:56.850]  Again, another insight into her control freak narcissistic mindset.
[02:32:57.991 --> 02:33:13.023]   Now there's a video, and you can find it on YouTube from 2015, headlined Nina Jankowicz My Simple Christmas Wish, And again, this is a woman who is basically a failed theatrical performer.
[02:33:13.403 --> 02:33:22.647]  She got recruited by left-wing activist groups a few years ago to become this, you know, disinformation czar, specifically in terms of Ukraine.
[02:33:23.626 --> 02:33:28.425]   she's in this bar somewhere performing this song called my simple
[02:33:28.425 --> 02:33:40.505]   put your mouth over your nose that's why you're in the theater
[02:33:40.505 --> 02:33:56.186]   that is the rule if you don't want to follow the rule what do you think you are if you do not respect the people
[02:33:56.186 --> 02:33:57.586]   that are sitting around you You pay my salary!
[02:33:57.626 --> 02:33:57.846]  Bullshit!
[02:33:58.566 --> 02:34:00.287]  Chris Harper pays my salary!
[02:34:00.328 --> 02:34:02.549]  Who do you think you are?
[02:34:03.069 --> 02:34:06.611]  Just put your mask over your nose!
[02:34:10.673 --> 02:34:16.918]  If you had asked me all this stuff a year ago about the corruption that's going on, I would have said you're crazy.
[02:34:16.998 --> 02:34:21.061]  There's no way that there could be this level of corruption in government.
[02:34:21.121 --> 02:34:26.866]  You shouldn't listen to InfoWars and Band.Video because that's all nonsense.
[02:34:26.986 --> 02:34:32.130]  And, you know, we shouldn't pay attention to any of this stuff.
[02:34:32.690 --> 02:34:42.638]   It's been very evident to me that all of these people who are being labeled as misinformation spreaders I mean, they're the guys telling the truth.
[02:34:43.119 --> 02:34:49.264]  There are many thousands of physicians who have been silenced from telling the American people the good news about the situation.
[02:34:49.804 --> 02:34:51.446]  This is the Sonic News.
[02:34:51.466 --> 02:34:54.548]  I briefly lost connection there, but I was talking about Nina Jankiewicz again.
[02:34:55.009 --> 02:35:03.236]  So she's putting out tweets complaining about high school children basically going out on a date and not being six feet away from her.
[02:35:04.173 --> 02:35:10.056]  And she goes, lock us down, we need to lock down harder, we need this to be enforced, imposed on us even harder.
[02:35:10.537 --> 02:35:15.580]  Again, this is an insight into the mindset of a narcissistic control freak.
[02:35:16.480 --> 02:35:23.344]  And again, I'm going to come back and talk about this YouTube video, which again gives another crystal clear insight into her mindset.
[02:35:24.514 --> 02:35:31.756]  And how she talks about other completely verifiable concerns being disinformation again.
[02:35:32.257 --> 02:35:34.637]  Who gets to decide what is disinformation?
[02:35:34.737 --> 02:35:45.801]  People like her, who are hyper-partisan hacks, who think that any information which contradicts or harms the regime's narrative is disinformation.
[02:35:45.881 --> 02:35:47.161]  Do you see the problem there?
[02:35:47.541 --> 02:35:49.242]  Do you see the slippery slope there?
[02:35:49.762 --> 02:35:59.619]  So we're going to come back and get into more explosive revelations about Nina Jankiewicz, big sister Biden's Ministry of Truth czar, on the other side.
[02:35:59.679 --> 02:36:00.921]  This is the Summit News Hour.
[02:36:01.101 --> 02:36:01.923]  Summit.News.
[02:36:01.963 --> 02:36:02.604]  Don't go away.
[02:36:02.483 --> 02:36:12.483]  We'll be back.
[02:36:12.483 --> 02:36:27.522]   So we are back to talk about Nina Jankowicz, the Biden administration's Ministry of Truth
[02:36:27.522 --> 02:36:34.322]   Czar, big sister, again freaking out on Twitter during the first lockdown, I assume about
[02:36:34.322 --> 02:36:42.323]   two high schoolers on a date not being further from her, demanding that lockdowns be forced upon
[02:36:42.323 --> 02:36:47.363]   us, quote, so force away, lock us down, people are not taking this seriously.
[02:36:48.231 --> 02:36:50.153]  This woman is a complete control freak.
[02:36:50.213 --> 02:36:55.236]  There's a video of her, as I mentioned, on YouTube, Nina Jankiewicz's My Simple Christmas Wish.
[02:36:55.977 --> 02:37:04.263]  And basically, it's a song about her wanting to be famous and powerful and to crush her enemies beneath her feet.
[02:37:04.784 --> 02:37:07.646]  Very revealing insight into her mindset.
[02:37:08.927 --> 02:37:35.748]   And again, she's come out with every single, on every single topic, Embarrassing, negative, harmful to the regime's narrative, whether it be on the Hunter Biden laptop story, whether it be on COVID, and whether it be on CRT, and branded that disinformation as an excuse, again, to have it downranked by the algorithm and buried by social media platforms as a Daily Mail headline.
[02:37:36.454 --> 02:37:43.718]  Biden's new disinformations are said fears about CRT in Ludum County schools are disinformation for profit.
[02:37:43.778 --> 02:37:54.243]  Again, every single narrative harmful to the far left, harmful to the Biden administration, harmful to the regime is branded by her disinformation.
[02:37:54.323 --> 02:37:56.244]  She's a hyper partisan hack.
[02:37:56.605 --> 02:37:59.146]  She's not a neutral participant.
[02:38:00.959 --> 02:38:03.362]  Says Joe Biden's new disinformations are dismissed.
[02:38:03.382 --> 02:38:13.053]  Concerns about critical race theory in schools as disinformation for profit, despite parents across the country being worried about the teaching of the philosophy in their children's classrooms.
[02:38:13.113 --> 02:38:13.293]  Again.
[02:38:14.443 --> 02:38:15.904]  They launched this offensive.
[02:38:15.964 --> 02:38:18.325]  They launched the drag queen story time.
[02:38:18.606 --> 02:38:23.588]  They launched all the LGBT grooming in schools in America.
[02:38:23.889 --> 02:38:24.449]  They do it.
[02:38:24.689 --> 02:38:26.010]  They throw it in your face.
[02:38:26.170 --> 02:38:29.352]  Then when you complain about it, they say it doesn't exist.
[02:38:29.752 --> 02:38:37.817]  Meanwhile, they're literally putting parents on DHS government threat level terror alert lists because they complained about this kind of thing.
[02:38:38.297 --> 02:38:44.342]  While publicly in their media hit pieces and in their commentary saying none of it exists.
[02:38:44.422 --> 02:38:46.143]  It's absolutely incredible.
[02:38:46.663 --> 02:38:57.571]  This is the woman being given power to control free speech on social media in the aftermath of them freaking out about Elon Musk purchasing Twitter itself.
[02:38:58.472 --> 02:39:22.190]   New York Post reports Stephen King blasted for supporting Biden disinformation czar Nina Jankiewicz Now you know when somebody who is as vehement as Stephen King in being a mouthpiece, an organ of propaganda for the regime, comes out and defends her, then you know that she's really getting some flack from the right people, from the right direction, and that they're panicking about it.
[02:39:23.171 --> 02:39:33.577]  Says Master of Horror Stephen King was blasted on social media over his support for new White House disinformations on Ina Jankowicz, with one lawmaker calling it the scariest thing he's ever written.
[02:39:34.890 --> 02:39:38.031]  He basically said, quote, I stand with Nina Jankiewicz.
[02:39:38.131 --> 02:39:51.613]  Very interesting commentary, tweet, from an author to publicly back the Ministry of Truth disinformations are for the Department of Homeland Security.
[02:39:52.094 --> 02:39:56.554]  Doesn't really seem like a subject that an author should insert himself into.
[02:39:57.195 --> 02:39:58.875]  Seems a bit obscure, doesn't it?
[02:39:59.575 --> 02:40:01.015]  And yet he's doing it anyway.
[02:40:02.436 --> 02:40:05.983]   One person responded, says, This was Carmine Sabia.
[02:40:06.063 --> 02:40:15.289]  He said, Author stands against free speech, but when a Republican becomes president, and it will happen again, then we will see where all these liberals stand on the disinformation governance board.
[02:40:15.409 --> 02:40:16.650]  Oh yeah, I remember.
[02:40:17.271 --> 02:40:29.779]  Under Bush, with the terror alert, threat levels, the colour coding, everything that the Department of Homeland Security did under the Bush administration was creepy, was dystopian, was Orwellian.
[02:40:30.139 --> 02:40:31.240]  The left hated it.
[02:40:31.760 --> 02:40:34.242]  And I supported them in hating it, because it was.
[02:40:35.002 --> 02:40:40.246]  But as soon as it's happening under Biden, oh, it's just content moderation!
[02:40:40.827 --> 02:40:47.372]  That ridiculous euphemism they use over and over again, when it's censorship brazen.
[02:40:49.453 --> 02:40:59.561]  Prize-winning journalist Glenn Greenwald also joined in on the criticism, calling Chenkiewicz a despotic imbecile, a cartoon figure spouting non-stop lies.
[02:41:00.842 --> 02:41:05.723]  And he also made the point that it's pretty creepy for Stephen King to insert himself into it.
[02:41:06.743 --> 02:41:15.705]  He said, but even if she weren't, even if she were phenomenal, what kind of person proudly stands with the head of a disinformation board inside the Department of Homeland Security?
[02:41:15.725 --> 02:41:16.065]  Yeah.
[02:41:16.845 --> 02:41:17.786]  Somewhat strange.
[02:41:19.126 --> 02:41:24.467]  Meanwhile, FDA chief claims misinformation is the leading cause of death in the United States.
[02:41:25.123 --> 02:41:27.465]  Forget about cancer, forget about heart disease.
[02:41:28.025 --> 02:41:32.248]  Now it's somebody posting on Twitter about vaccines.
[02:41:32.968 --> 02:41:41.574]  During an appearance on CNN, FDA chief Dr. Robert Califf asserted that the leading cause of death in the United States is online misinformation.
[02:41:42.054 --> 02:41:47.778]  He didn't provide any evidence of that, didn't give any examples, didn't break down any statistics.
[02:41:48.219 --> 02:41:51.541]  He just said it, and it was repeated ad infinitum.
[02:41:52.562 --> 02:41:58.740]   Meanwhile, TikTok censors viral videos alleging inconsistencies in Amber Heard testimony.
[02:41:59.301 --> 02:42:12.833]  Basically what happened, TikTok, which is one of the fastest growing, if not basically bigger than Twitter now from the last numbers I saw, the most vehement in terms of censorship.
[02:42:12.894 --> 02:42:17.718]  Try starting a TikTok account as somebody on the right of politics.
[02:42:18.138 --> 02:42:19.680]  You ain't gonna last very long.
[02:42:20.638 --> 02:42:24.939]  They used the old system, which some YouTube used back a few years ago.
[02:42:25.359 --> 02:42:29.900]  Basically means if a mob mass reports a video, it gets deleted immediately.
[02:42:30.761 --> 02:42:35.942]  And now Rolling Stone wrote a whining hit piece trying to defend Amber Heard.
[02:42:35.962 --> 02:42:39.923]  And it was headlined, Demoralizing and demeaning!
[02:42:39.943 --> 02:42:43.384]  A gross TikTok trend mocking Amber Heard is going viral!
[02:42:43.804 --> 02:42:47.305]  What was this, demoralizing and demeaning gross TikTok trend?
[02:42:48.160 --> 02:42:52.883]  Well, basically, the biggest thing they were angry about is a cat meme video.
[02:42:53.583 --> 02:43:05.571]  Yes, somebody created a cat meme video with one cat wearing a blonde wig performing the role of Amber Heard, and another cat with a different wig performing the role of Johnny Depp.
[02:43:06.211 --> 02:43:12.275]  They basically made out that the cats were saying what Amber Heard and Johnny Depp said during their testimonies.
[02:43:12.975 --> 02:43:17.038]  In particular, the part where she says she turned to look at Depp after he hit her.
[02:43:17.825 --> 02:43:22.778]  The original video's caption read, don't you have to be looking at someone in the face to be able to slap them across it?
[02:43:23.396 --> 02:43:37.582]  So basically they're making fun of Amber Heard's dubious, inconsistent testimony when it came to Johnny Depp's behaviour via the medium of cat memes, and apparently that upsets journalists who work for the Rolling Stone.
[02:43:37.942 --> 02:43:52.868]  We immediately started a campaign to have TikTok remove the videos, and they did remove the videos for, quote, violating policies of bullying and harassment, which doesn't allow, quote, content that disparages victims of violent tragedies.
[02:43:53.727 --> 02:44:00.509]  Yes, apparently what happened, or what didn't happen to Amber Heard, was a violent tragedy.
[02:44:01.209 --> 02:44:03.570]  And Rolling Stone demanded the video be removed.
[02:44:04.090 --> 02:44:08.752]  It was removed, despite having 14 million views, along with a bunch of others.
[02:44:10.552 --> 02:44:16.354]  AP suggests Elon Musk is a hypocrite for supporting free speech, but using it to, quote, attack his critics.
[02:44:17.094 --> 02:44:24.898]   This is as dumb as the people who claim Elon Musk doesn't believe in free speech because he blocked them on Twitter.
[02:44:25.599 --> 02:44:31.722]  No, free speech doesn't include the necessity that anyone needs to listen to your free speech.
[02:44:32.902 --> 02:44:41.547]  The Associated Press published a bizarre article suggesting Elon Musk is a hypocrite for supporting free speech on Twitter, yet using the platform to attack his critics.
[02:44:41.907 --> 02:44:48.270]  Right, so if you engage in free speech to respond to somebody else's free speech, that makes you a hypocrite.
[02:44:48.330 --> 02:44:49.311]  No, that's dumb.
[02:44:50.729 --> 02:44:58.276]  It says Elon Musk boasts that he's acquiring Twitter to defend freedom of speech, but he has long used the platform to attack those who disagree with him.
[02:44:58.336 --> 02:45:00.258]  Yes, he's responded to his critics.
[02:45:00.358 --> 02:45:01.499]  Oh my God, the horror.
[02:45:03.601 --> 02:45:10.847]  Glenn Greenwald responded to this by saying Elon Musk claims to be in free speech yet argues with those who disagree and attack him.
[02:45:11.247 --> 02:45:11.908]  Checkmate.
[02:45:13.630 --> 02:45:13.870]  And again.
[02:45:14.915 --> 02:45:18.416]  Your free speech doesn't compel others to listen to it.
[02:45:18.476 --> 02:45:38.343]  The fact that this has to be explained to notable journalists who work for the Associated Press is pretty ironic, given the fact that they literally accompanied SBU thugs in Ukraine as they arrested critics of President Zelensky in house-to-house raids, literally kidnapping them from their own homes.
[02:45:38.424 --> 02:45:39.644]  Summit.News, we'll be back.
[02:45:40.004 --> 02:45:48.209]  Well, finishing off with social media censorship news, of course we have Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter about to go through here in the next couple of months, hopefully.
[02:45:49.329 --> 02:45:55.473]  Zero Hedge reports Twitter to freeze hiring cut costs as key employees fired or leaving.
[02:45:56.193 --> 02:45:58.354]  Could this be the woke exodus?
[02:45:59.035 --> 02:46:07.980]  Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal announced a hiring freeze and other cost-cutting measures on Thursday as the company looks to refocus into the Elon Musk takeover.
[02:46:08.960 --> 02:46:14.802]  One of these employees, Bruce Falk, tweeted that he was leaving the company after seven years.
[02:46:14.822 --> 02:46:19.604]  He said, the truth is, this isn't how and when I imagined I'd be leaving Twitter.
[02:46:20.244 --> 02:46:35.750]  And he's going to be replaced by someone called Jay Sullivan, who as recently as today, in fact, responded to Elon Musk's tweet and said, quote, yes, algorithmic choice and transparency is the right direction and where we are headed.
[02:46:36.454 --> 02:46:46.221]  So this guy seems pretty up on transparency and stopping algorithmic suppression of certain stories, certain narratives, and in support of free speech.
[02:46:46.261 --> 02:46:53.886]  And he is the person who is replacing this other individual who seems to be, shall we say, on the woke side of the equation.
[02:46:54.287 --> 02:47:03.293]  So we already see employees leaving, new ones being hired before the purchase has even been rubber-stamped, which of course is a good sign.
[02:47:04.434 --> 02:47:09.868]   Now then, Broadway star angrily lectures audience member for not wearing a mask.
[02:47:10.408 --> 02:47:11.789]  Well, not wearing a mask!
[02:47:12.410 --> 02:47:14.331]  This is Broadway star Patti LuPone.
[02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:19.581]  Who was taking part in a Q&A session, so again, this wasn't a theatrical performance.
[02:47:20.081 --> 02:47:25.463]  If they're so keen on everyone wearing a friggin' mask, why weren't they wearing one?
[02:47:25.523 --> 02:47:37.186]  She's surrounded by all her colleagues up on stage, none of them wearing masks, but that didn't stop her from screeching at an audience member for not wearing a mask properly.
[02:47:37.226 --> 02:47:38.226]  Here's the clip.
[02:47:38.226 --> 02:47:48.226]  [APPLAUSE]
[02:47:48.226 --> 02:47:58.226]  [APPLAUSE]
[02:47:58.226 --> 02:48:08.226]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:48:08.226 --> 02:48:23.685]   So again, she's basically screeching at publicly humiliating an audience member because she's not wearing a mask over
[02:48:23.685 --> 02:48:24.305]  her nose.
[02:48:24.274 --> 02:48:30.246]   Someone who literally pays her way, pays For God knows what reason to see her show.
[02:48:30.266 --> 02:48:33.808]  And again, it was a Q&A session, wasn't a theatrical performance.
[02:48:34.208 --> 02:48:36.269]  Why are you not wearing a mask?
[02:48:36.989 --> 02:48:42.792]  She's made a previous appearance on The View, where she demanded that mask mandates be kept in place for much longer.
[02:48:43.432 --> 02:48:45.833]  The rest of Europe basically got rid of them.
[02:48:46.454 --> 02:48:50.115]  Sweden never had them in the first place, at least not strictly enforced.
[02:48:50.456 --> 02:48:55.358]  They had one of the lowest per capita death rates out of the entire continent.
[02:48:56.440 --> 02:48:59.443]  And you're still carrying on with this mask theatre.
[02:49:00.224 --> 02:49:02.647]  I mean, I don't even see it in the UK anymore.
[02:49:03.207 --> 02:49:08.213]  The only people wearing masks in the UK now, by and large, are American tourists.
[02:49:08.533 --> 02:49:10.735]  Because it's ingrained into the coding.
[02:49:11.016 --> 02:49:12.357]  They just can't let it go.
[02:49:13.839 --> 02:49:23.440]   Again, despite the fact that we've pointed out No scientific evidence shows that masks have any measurable impact on stopping the spread of COVID-19.
[02:49:23.840 --> 02:49:29.765]  They have had a very successful impact in stunting the cognitive development of toddlers and babies.
[02:49:30.645 --> 02:49:32.567]  That's a really good effect that they've had.
[02:49:33.368 --> 02:49:38.852]  And I still see parents, women with prams in the street, wearing masks.
[02:49:39.452 --> 02:49:43.736]  You're literally retarding your children, you stupid morons!
[02:49:44.727 --> 02:49:52.890]  The UK government's own investigation found the evidence for the efficacy of face masks stopping the spread of COVID-19 in schools was, quote, not conclusive.
[02:49:53.350 --> 02:49:55.030]  But they went ahead and introduced them anyway.
[02:49:55.951 --> 02:50:13.598]   University of Oxford professor Jim Naismith noted that when England dropped face mask mandates back in July and Scotland maintained them, it made, quote, no meaningful difference to infection rates and in fact The next winter we saw the mask mandates in England be dropped permanently once again.
[02:50:13.638 --> 02:50:14.659]  They haven't come back since.
[02:50:15.099 --> 02:50:17.039]  They maintained them in Scotland and Wales.
[02:50:17.319 --> 02:50:19.560]  Their Covid cases continued going up.
[02:50:20.080 --> 02:50:21.801]  It has no impact whatsoever.
[02:50:21.861 --> 02:50:23.801]  Some people say it makes it even worse.
[02:50:24.221 --> 02:50:25.422]  But it's part of the cult.
[02:50:25.782 --> 02:50:27.683]  It's part of the high status symboling.
[02:50:28.523 --> 02:50:33.364]  I'm a member of the mob and I'm going to screech at you on my power trip.
[02:50:34.525 --> 02:50:39.006]  We previously highlighted the comments of UK government SAGE advisor Dr Colin Axon.
[02:50:40.106 --> 02:50:50.856]  We dismiss face masks as comfort blankets that do virtually nothing, noting that the COVID-19 virus particle is up to 5,000 times smaller than the holes in the mask.
[02:50:50.916 --> 02:50:54.820]  But if it makes you feel like you're a good person, you go ahead.
[02:50:56.272 --> 02:51:03.536]  He said the small sizes are not easily understood, but an imperfect analogy would be to imagine marbles fired at builders scaffolding.
[02:51:03.936 --> 02:51:07.598]  Some might hit a pole and rebound, but obviously most will fly through.
[02:51:07.718 --> 02:51:08.799]  They don't care about that.
[02:51:09.079 --> 02:51:10.360]  They don't care about the science.
[02:51:10.580 --> 02:51:12.301]  It's about high status symboling.
[02:51:12.701 --> 02:51:22.747]  I'm part of the mob that has ascribed itself the power to screech at you for not properly displaying your obsequiousness to the dictates of the mob.
[02:51:23.706 --> 02:51:29.594]  Well now there are more lockdown advocates fleeing the sinking ship that is the pro-lockdown narrative.
[02:51:30.074 --> 02:51:33.879]  Lockdown advocate admits negative impacts were never considered.
[02:51:34.800 --> 02:51:41.950]  This is Professor John Edmonds who was part of the SAGE team that told the government there would be 6,000 Omicron deaths per day.
[02:51:42.657 --> 02:51:48.223]  If they didn't lock down again this previous Christmas in the United Kingdom, we didn't lock down again.
[02:51:48.243 --> 02:51:56.532]  The deaths per day got nowhere near that because we knew the evidence out of South Africa said that it was a milder variant of the virus.
[02:51:56.892 --> 02:51:58.674]  We were proven right once again.
[02:51:58.694 --> 02:52:01.137]  They were on the wrong side of history once again.
[02:52:03.030 --> 02:52:13.573]  And maybe it's a, I don't know, a pang of moral conscience, or maybe it's just covering their behinds, but many of them are slowly starting to trickle out and admit that yes, they should have factored in.
[02:52:14.241 --> 02:52:26.929]  The giant waiting lists, the untreated serious diseases, the massive mental health crisis, the economic devastation that again pushed more people into poverty.
[02:52:27.169 --> 02:52:28.410]  Poverty causes death.
[02:52:28.950 --> 02:52:31.752]  They're now saying, oh maybe we should have thought about that.
[02:52:32.112 --> 02:52:33.933]  Well too little, too late.
[02:52:34.974 --> 02:52:41.117]  Sweden on the other hand suffered fewer deaths per capita than much of Europe despite refusing to enforce strict lockdowns.
[02:52:42.258 --> 02:52:55.190]   New figures from the WHO Show that Sweden had fewer Covid deaths per capita than much of Europe despite refusing to enforce strict lockdowns and mask mandates like numerous other nearby countries.
[02:52:55.390 --> 02:53:08.136]  In 2020-2021 the country had an average excess death rate of 56 per 100,000 compared to 109 in the UK, which had strict lockdowns and mask mandates for much of that two-year period.
[02:53:09.377 --> 02:53:12.258]  111 in Spain, which had even stricter lockdowns.
[02:53:12.278 --> 02:53:17.120]  133 in Italy, which had even stricter lockdowns still.
[02:53:18.581 --> 02:53:19.701]  Isn't that interesting?
[02:53:19.721 --> 02:53:27.344]  The European countries that had stricter mask mandates, stricter lockdowns, had more deaths per capita.
[02:53:27.504 --> 02:53:30.665]  Again, you were on the wrong side of history.
[02:53:30.725 --> 02:53:35.787]  People need to remember this and not let them scuttle away with their tails between their legs.
[02:53:37.466 --> 02:53:41.831]  Meanwhile, the media is confused about this new hepatitis outbreak.
[02:53:41.871 --> 02:53:47.677]  Sky News reports hepatitis child dies in Ireland after being treated for mystery form of the disease.
[02:53:47.697 --> 02:53:53.983]  A child treated for acute hepatitis at a hospital in the Republic of Ireland has died.
[02:53:54.544 --> 02:53:58.128]  Daily Mail reports 13 more children fall sick with mystery.
[02:53:58.985 --> 02:53:59.786]  It's a mystery.
[02:53:59.866 --> 02:54:02.010]  Hepatitis, bringing UK total to 176.
[02:54:02.210 --> 02:54:08.219]  As Ireland says, one child has died from liver disease of unknown origin.
[02:54:08.639 --> 02:54:10.702]  Of course, it's not a mystery.
[02:54:10.963 --> 02:54:12.425]  We know why this is happening.
[02:54:13.522 --> 02:54:32.988]  These cases are linked to adenoviruses which cause the common cold, but because children haven't been socialised properly over the past two years, because they've been locked down, because they've been kept out of school, because they've been kept out of birthday parties, kept away from their friends, their immune systems are completely weakened.
[02:54:33.689 --> 02:54:59.354]  These adenoviruses normally develop into the common cold, but if you have a weakened immune system, as these kids do, because of lockdown policies, then they're unable to fight it off, and it turns into the more serious disease of hepatitis, which is now causing children needing to get liver transplants, and in some cases across the world, children dying of hepatitis.
[02:54:59.394 --> 02:55:03.335]  So, another great moral victory for the lockdown advocates.
[02:55:04.252 --> 02:55:05.612]  And the mask freaks!
[02:55:06.792 --> 02:55:10.213]  Stephen Colbert catches Covid for the second time in the space of three weeks.
[02:55:11.553 --> 02:55:21.375]  After thanking vaccine efficacy, the vaccine worked so well, he's triple-vaxxed, maybe he's even quadruple-vaxxed, like Kamala Harris also caught Covid recently.
[02:55:22.355 --> 02:55:26.796]  Now he's being forced to take another week off from taping his god-awful show.
[02:55:26.916 --> 02:55:29.817]  Remember that cringeworthy vaccine sketch?
[02:55:30.717 --> 02:55:32.317]  Because he's got Covid again!
[02:55:33.812 --> 02:55:35.914]  How did that work out for you, Stephen?
[02:55:36.034 --> 02:55:37.235]  The vaccine!
[02:55:37.415 --> 02:55:38.556]  How many have you had now?
[02:55:38.796 --> 02:55:39.156]  Three?
[02:55:39.256 --> 02:55:39.596]  Four?
[02:55:39.857 --> 02:55:40.617]  Gonna get a fifth?
[02:55:41.378 --> 02:55:45.041]  He had COVID on April 21st, now he's got it again!
[02:55:46.662 --> 02:55:47.683]  Safe and effective.
[02:55:47.883 --> 02:55:48.984]  Safe and effective.
[02:55:49.944 --> 02:55:51.506]  That's gonna wrap it up for the show.
[02:55:51.666 --> 02:55:53.627]  War Room is coming up next.
[02:55:53.667 --> 02:55:54.668]  We're gonna delve more.
[02:55:54.788 --> 02:55:55.789]  I'm gonna do a video on this.
[02:55:56.565 --> 02:55:59.106]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have had quite a run here at InfoWars.
[02:55:58.925 --> 02:56:01.925]  are because there's a lot more to come out about her.
[02:56:01.925 --> 02:56:03.085]  She's a control freak.
[02:56:03.085 --> 02:56:06.604]  They're empowering her to dismantle your free speech.
[02:56:06.604 --> 02:56:08.905]  War Room is next, summit.news, don't go away.
[02:56:08.905 --> 02:56:11.645]  (dramatic music)
[02:56:11.645 --> 02:56:19.125]   Ladies and gentlemen, we have had quite a run here at InfoWars.
[02:56:19.125 --> 02:56:25.245]   We've had a huge, huge effect when it comes to the fight against the globalists.
[02:56:25.245 --> 02:56:27.046]  And we've changed the world together.
[02:56:27.554 --> 02:56:37.756]  And I want to thank you for all you've done over the years with your prayers, your word of mouth, and shopping with us, and supporting us, while at the same time getting great products at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:56:39.057 --> 02:56:57.527]   But now, because of supply chain breakdowns, and now because of all the Democratic Party-funded lawsuits, and the slanted nature of those attacks, We are maxed out and pushed up against a wall, just like America's pushed up against a wall.
[02:56:57.828 --> 02:56:58.728]  And we're being bullied.
[02:56:58.748 --> 02:57:04.754]  We're being brutalized by the special interests that want to get through us to be able to get to you.
[02:57:04.834 --> 02:57:13.619]   So if we put today's live show headline up on screen for TV viewers, And ask the question, did Alex Jones Infowars declare bankruptcy?
[02:57:14.561 --> 02:57:15.602]  Tune in and learn the truth.
[02:57:15.742 --> 02:57:42.266]   If you scroll down in that live show feed today, you'll find a subsection that's on InfowarsStore.com, where when you click on it, it takes you to a subpage And InfoWarsTore.com, where you can make a $5, $10, $20, $50, $100 one-time donation, or you can sign up for a recurring donation cancel any time.
[02:57:42.966 --> 02:57:51.311]  But this is the time in the fight for freedom to understand they're going to take everything from you if you don't start spending time and energy in the fight.
[02:57:51.612 --> 02:57:55.294]  And I'm not talking to regular listeners that have supported us over the years and done a great job.
[02:57:55.554 --> 02:58:11.107]   I'm talking to new listeners or occasional listeners You need to understand, this is a serious situation we're in and you need to put skin in the game financially to keep operations on the air like Infowars.
[02:58:11.567 --> 02:58:19.089]  Think of the millions of people that learned about ivermectin and zinc and vitamin D and hydroxychloroquine alone from this show.
[02:58:19.450 --> 02:58:23.851]  Think about the pedophile drag queen story times that have been exposed and stopped by this broadcast.
[02:58:24.631 --> 02:58:29.572]  Think about our border reports exposing the human smuggling that triggered congressional investigations.
[02:58:30.333 --> 02:58:32.873]  Think about our anti-war reporting.
[02:58:32.973 --> 02:58:38.155]  Think about our 9-11 in Bohemian Grove and our reporting on the globalists and the occult.
[02:58:38.455 --> 02:58:46.077]  I mean, to try to list our exposure of fluoride in the water and atrazine and the attack on our children with the whole transgender cult.
[02:58:46.697 --> 02:58:51.759]  Think about everything we've been through together and just imagine Infowars not being there.
[02:58:52.759 --> 02:59:03.145]  So I want to ask you to go to infowarestore.com and every day during the live show, under the live show feed, we'll have a link to it as well, where you can donate and we can buy products.
[02:59:03.225 --> 02:59:15.113]  And again, all the t-shirts, all the apparel, all the ball caps, all the flags, some of it going back, some of the stuff's been in the warehouse five years, over a hundred designs, great shirts, great ball caps, you name it, we're selling it all at cost.
[02:59:15.513 --> 02:59:20.036]  In the future, we're just going to have limited edition shirts for a limited time, only a few designs at a time.
[02:59:21.357 --> 02:59:23.978]  Because we can't sit there and pay for the larger inventory.
[02:59:24.018 --> 02:59:24.799]  We just can't do it.
[02:59:25.259 --> 02:59:26.620]  So, one-of-a-kind shirts.
[02:59:26.660 --> 02:59:27.780]  Get them at Infowars.com.
[02:59:27.820 --> 02:59:31.342]  And the new Alex Jones Was Right shirt.
[02:59:31.602 --> 02:59:32.503]  Very good looking shirt.
[02:59:32.823 --> 02:59:33.743]  Big red thunderbolt.
[02:59:33.803 --> 02:59:35.344]  Alex Jones Was Right on the back.
[02:59:36.005 --> 02:59:37.145]  Infowars.com.
[02:59:37.425 --> 02:59:38.726]  This is a limited edition shirt.
[02:59:38.746 --> 02:59:41.728]  We're only selling this limited edition for one month.
[02:59:42.448 --> 02:59:45.930]  And it's $24.95, so we get $18 from the sales.
[02:59:45.950 --> 02:59:46.750]  It's really nice fabric.
[02:59:46.770 --> 02:59:47.931]  It's an expensive shirt for us to make.
[02:59:49.261 --> 02:59:49.941]  I'm counting on you.
[02:59:49.961 --> 02:59:50.601]  Stay with us.
