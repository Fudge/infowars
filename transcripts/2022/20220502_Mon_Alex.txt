[00:00.000 --> 00:29.000]  I'm sick and tired of giving in my own way, I'm sick and tired of everything I see while I'm alone.
[00:29.000 --> 00:39.000]  And nobody rides me free, nobody rides me free.
[00:39.000 --> 00:47.000]  There's something cause I know what I say, I'm on my way, no, you're not gonna change my plan.
[00:47.000 --> 00:55.000]  If you can break the way, see what I say, you'll understand what brings life back.
[00:55.000 --> 01:04.000]  I'm sick and tired of talking about little things, I'm sick and tired of everyone in my way.
[01:04.000 --> 01:13.000]  Nobody rides me free, nobody rides me free.
[01:13.000 --> 01:32.000]  It's Monday, May 2nd, the year is 2022, I'm gonna host Alex Jones and Imple Wars is on fire as we enter the great confrontation with the fabled New World Order.
[01:32.000 --> 01:42.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, all the pieces came together in the last 24 hours and I have got chills shooting up and down my spine right now.
[01:42.000 --> 01:55.000]  I have the legislation, I have the statements, I have the videos, I have the admissions of the criminal elements of the deep state and the United States government.
[01:55.000 --> 02:10.000]  Running Ukraine for over a decade is a money laundering operation admitting that the censorship and control and secret arrest and torture and murder of people that just say I'm against this war and I think Zelensky's bad.
[02:10.000 --> 02:26.000]  They are on the news. Mainstream media is running around like this is a good thing with the Associated Press.
[02:26.000 --> 02:37.000]  Rounding people up. This is unprecedented.
[02:37.000 --> 03:05.000]  Now, this is such an incredible moment to be alive and to have our media that is the enemy of the people publicly celebrating the secret police breaking down doors and saying you are critical of Zelensky,
[03:05.000 --> 03:19.000]  you are critical of this war and so now you are gonna go to a prison for decades and you are gonna be tortured and a lot of you are gonna be killed.
[03:19.000 --> 03:33.000]  You have already seen how they shoot him in the knees. This is as bad police state as you can get. This is North Korea and they are saying it on national television.
[03:33.000 --> 03:53.000]  This is being aired all over the US is a good thing to take people away for mildly criticizing a corrupt government and the people confessing that well, yeah, I did criticize the war.
[03:53.000 --> 04:05.000]  And then the women under Stockholm syndrome, groveling and hugging and kissing the asses of the secret police paramilitary teams that are going around and arresting everybody.
[04:05.000 --> 04:29.000]  Now, you have to understand our government is directing that while simultaneously calling for similar things here. Barack Obama came out and gave a speech last week that got little attention but it's going viral now and said we need to go beyond just censorship.
[04:29.000 --> 04:41.000]  With the new Ministry of Truth, we need to start arresting people basically. It's what his surrogates are saying but he said we need to go beyond the current censorship and anyone criticizing what we are doing is promoting violence.
[04:41.000 --> 04:49.000]  Even if you don't say I want violence, if you say we have a bad corrupt government, that's violence and you need to be debanked, de-platformed and arrested.
[04:49.000 --> 05:00.000]  And of course, Obama really is the president right now. It's his third term. We'll be right back. Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.

[05:53.000 --> 06:12.000]  We are the tip of the spear, you are the tip of the spear and I salute you and thank you. Visit Infowars.com today.
[06:12.000 --> 06:21.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[06:21.000 --> 06:36.000]  I am begging every listener and viewer of this show to realize that you are the vanguard of resistance to this takeover and that you will simply continue to spread the word about the broadcast and warn the people and raise the alarm like Paul Revere's.
[06:36.000 --> 06:50.000]  We can galvanize our legislatures, our towns, our cities and our Congress to come out against what's happening. Now let me be very specific here and I'll go through all the evidence because it's massive.
[06:50.000 --> 06:58.000]  The Republican Party is bought off by big tech most of them. They're almost as bad as the Democrats.
[06:58.000 --> 07:16.000]  There is a Trumpian populist nationalist movement that Trump wrote in on but Trump did not create that is taking over the Republican Party and it's very popular with the people of every race, color and creed because they're populist too and want common sense.
[07:16.000 --> 07:30.000]  They don't want open borders. They don't want devalued currency. They don't want drag queen pedophile story time. They don't want all these wars. They don't want the tyranny of the great reset.
[07:30.000 --> 07:50.000]  So the system is in a total panic knowing it's losing control and knowing that the big corporate global empire that Black Rock and Vanguard and the rest of them have set up that the U.S. military enforces is coming to an end everywhere so they want to start a major global war on top of the previous lockdowns and new lockdowns
[07:50.000 --> 08:01.000]  as the pretext for why everything collapses so there will be a true global reset of the world currencies and the digital programmable tokens they control. That's all been announced. It's all being pushed.
[08:01.000 --> 08:13.000]  The U.N. is setting it up. The treaty is set to be signed by Biden on what the 23rd of this month to put the U.N. in control of all of our healthcare and pandemic responses.
[08:13.000 --> 08:25.000]  I mean, it's happening now. Everything. The planets of tyranny are aligning. But in this moment, the world's waking up and they're trying to have this paradox where they admit, yes, we want dictators.
[08:25.000 --> 08:33.000]  Yes, we want to oppress people. Yes, we want to arrest those that disagree with the great loving new order takeover. That's Bloomberg, AP, Reuters.
[08:33.000 --> 08:44.000]  I showed you the headlines last week. Just dozens of them. Dictatorship's good. Censorship's good. We need less freedom. We need more dictatorial power. Those are headlines.
[08:44.000 --> 08:51.000]  And then all over the Sunday news shows and all over last week's shows, I've got like 20 of them here. Can't even cover them all.
[08:51.000 --> 09:04.000]  Of major government spokespersons and others on TV saying we need to take control of the information and not let the American people have access to Elon Musk or access to Alex Jones or access to any of this.
[09:04.000 --> 09:17.000]  We've got to stop it and take over everything. They're doing that out of extreme weakness. So they are normalizing ministries of truth, shutting down everybody that disagrees with them, arresting everybody.
[09:17.000 --> 09:27.000]  And that Biden's a good dictator. I'm showing the headlines right now from the Washington Post, Bloomberg, you name it.
[09:27.000 --> 09:40.000]  And then I've got all these clips of Obama and others saying big tech isn't going far enough with censorship. We need more.
[09:40.000 --> 09:50.000]  And then he points to a white paper that calls for arresting people and his minions on national TV have got three clips saying we want the European Union style control.
[09:50.000 --> 10:02.000]  And Macron has now announced a ID based on the vaccine passport to buy and sell. So has Australia. So has New Zealand. So has Italy.
[10:02.000 --> 10:10.000]  Oh, and it also tracks your carbon and tells you how much you can eat and when you can go out and when you're allowed to rent a car.
[10:10.000 --> 10:19.000]  Everything I told you about was in their own documents. Of course they attacked me when I was reporting their own documents because they didn't want to form any opposition to it.
[10:19.000 --> 10:34.000]  But now it's here. Where is Congress? We have Tulsi Gabbards saying that Obama is becoming a dictator and that Obama is really in control just as I've told you. You can see it yourself with his own alternate White House two miles away from the White House.
[10:34.000 --> 10:41.000]  He was still president when Trump was in with all his stay behind networks and the government rebelling against the people.
[10:41.000 --> 10:58.000]  So we're in a corporate coup here. So what's the answer? We've got to hammer Rand Paul, hammer Josh Hawley, hammer Senator Cruz, hammer them all and just say look, you know about the great reset in the New World Order.
[10:58.000 --> 11:09.000]  You know if you push too hard they come after you. But they're already coming after us. You need to come out and admit to America there's been a corporate global coup through the corporations and that it's illegal and it's dangerous
[11:09.000 --> 11:20.000]  and that they have a ministry of truth and want to start arresting their political opposition ahead of the election in 190 days. And they're obviously going to stage false flags as the pretext for that because they know it's over.
[11:20.000 --> 11:33.000]  They lost. Now use the Terminator analogy for the 1980s. James Cameron one. Skynet had already been blown up. Skynet was already defeated. So they had to send a Terminator back in time to try to kill the leader of the resistance.
[11:33.000 --> 11:46.000]  That's a simple analogy but that's it. They've already lost. Now all they can do is start a giant war and a world collapse and hope things are so bad during that that you ignore all the crimes they've committed and the Ponzi schemes
[11:46.000 --> 11:53.000]  and the thousands of trillions of dollars they created and gave themselves and the hyperinflation. We're coming to the end of the mega bubble.
[11:53.000 --> 12:07.000]  And out of it is world hunger, starvation, collapse. It's all being admitted and these guys are hinging everything on you being stupid and not watching and learning what they're saying and doing because seriously here's the paradox.
[12:07.000 --> 12:23.000]  They have to do a tightrope walk where they got to act confident at their deboss groups which is the public Bilderberg group and their CFR meetings and brag about their world government and brag about Kim trailing and brag about pedophilia and brag about world government and brag about
[12:23.000 --> 12:38.000]  world currencies and brag about medical IDs and brag about the casual society and the social credit scores and the carbon taxes to sit up there in their suits and their big hundred foot jumbo trons and behind their curtain like the Wizard of Oz.
[12:38.000 --> 12:53.000]  So they got to admit all the stuff they're doing to their minions and that less than one half of one percent that administer all this that are waging war against humanity that are eugenicists that openly say you have no free will we're going to kill all of you like Harari and where they admit the
[12:53.000 --> 13:05.000]  whole world government ships out of your skin to buy and sell but then simultaneously gaslight everyone sometimes in the same newspaper the same day it'll say we need dictatorship we need censorship.
[13:05.000 --> 13:15.000]  By the way over here Alex Jones is crazy and needs to be arrested he ran January 6 and he claims there's a world government wants to take your freedoms away and bring in a world ID.
[13:15.000 --> 13:18.000]  And what they're telling everybody is hey this is real.
[13:18.000 --> 13:30.000]  And if you don't go along with it you'll end up like Alex Jones they've now moved from denying it to like yeah we're setting up tyranny yeah we're secretly arrested people yeah we're totally taking over.
[13:30.000 --> 13:46.000]  What's gonna do about it. And they get up on TV and brag about yeah we told the head of the Ukraine if they investigated my son I'd hold back a billion dollars son of a bitch they fired him you know and they're just up there all exercising their
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.000]  power and pissing in our faces.
[13:49.000 --> 14:02.000]  And so you can go along with them all you want your life will get much worse if you even live if you're even alive in 2030 because under their plan they plan on 80 90% of us being dead in 2030 officially.
[14:02.000 --> 14:09.000]  Harari says by 2024 excuse me by 2044 there'll be no humans left.
[14:09.000 --> 14:16.000]  And they worship this man this is their plan and Ray Kurzweil and all of them make similar statements.
[14:16.000 --> 14:29.000]  Welcome to 2030 I own nothing I have no privacy and life's never been better that's from the World Economic Forum's own words gaslighting you got life sort of been better because you're going to be dead.
[14:29.000 --> 14:42.000]  Now we survive this or mitigate it will be saying in eight years well Jones said you know we'd 90% of me dead only a billion starved to death in the great famine only half a billion in the great new war so he was wrong.
[14:42.000 --> 14:58.000]  I mean it's already 40 something million extra starved to death the last two years that you had met and I believe the number 40 extra dead million people because they locked everything down not from the virus and it's just a tiny little footnote.
[14:58.000 --> 15:16.000]  So we come back I've got Obama saying we need more censorship and government control ministry of truth and then the most shocking video ever AP drooling and saying watch traders being rounded up for mildly criticizing Zelensky and saying that a lot of people don't support the ongoing war and one piece.
[15:16.000 --> 15:24.000]  You say mild things they come to your house in military gear and they take you away for years in prison.
[15:24.000 --> 15:37.000]  Ukraine hunts down traders and remember Ukraine is the model for what the globalist want to do in America and the globalist are running the whole response Ukraine and bragging about it and admitting it all and I have all their admissions.
[15:37.000 --> 15:48.000]  Right here and what is Obama saying we need to European model here in Germany in England they arrest you for political incorrectness this is the reality.
[15:48.000 --> 15:58.000]  Laying down will only make it worse for you standing up is what built this country in freedom and I intended not disgrace my ancestors I will stand firm to the end.
[16:18.000 --> 16:31.000]  I just started putting these out the last few years just sold out of 300,000 of a similar offering that was 40% more than we're selling this for and when you get three or more you can get these at 50% off and they fund the info war.

[19:00.000 --> 19:08.000]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the food.
[19:08.000 --> 19:19.000]  It's all come out and they're doing that not because we're weak but because we're made the image of God the creator and we are powerful and the social engineers fear that so much.
[19:19.000 --> 19:27.000]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy is it true.
[19:27.000 --> 19:39.000]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless they need all the propaganda and all their lies and all their evil all their cultural death because.
[19:39.000 --> 19:45.000]  They know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on to God of this world who is a loser.
[19:45.000 --> 19:51.000]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep info wars on the air now more than ever because even you don't believe in God.
[19:51.000 --> 20:00.000]  What the globalists are manifesting and setting up and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they just announced.
[20:00.000 --> 20:29.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones.
[20:29.000 --> 20:31.000]  What are they?
[20:31.000 --> 20:33.000]  Where are you going?
[20:33.000 --> 20:35.000]  Come here.
[20:35.000 --> 20:37.000]  Come here.
[20:37.000 --> 20:39.000]  What's going on?
[20:39.000 --> 20:41.000]  What's going on?
[20:41.000 --> 20:43.000]  Come here.
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.000]  What's going on?
[20:45.000 --> 20:47.000]  Come here.
[20:47.000 --> 20:49.000]  Come here.
[20:49.000 --> 20:51.000]  Come here.
[20:51.000 --> 20:53.000]  Come here.
[20:53.000 --> 20:55.000]  Come here.
[20:55.000 --> 21:05.000]  Come here.
[21:05.000 --> 21:11.000]  This ladies and gentlemen is where we live on planet Earth.
[21:11.000 --> 21:29.000]  And powerful corporate forces have taken over the planet through money laundering drug dealing sex trafficking and mainly creating artificial currency for themselves that they use to buy up infrastructure and media and control and build giant armies.
[21:29.000 --> 21:44.000]  And they think there's too many of us and they want to get rid of the human infestation that is on their land and their property they believe they stole it through fraud fair and square and that we didn't resist them so they believe survival the fittest social Darwinism.
[21:44.000 --> 21:55.000]  So you can say whatever you want about the political systems of the world and what the churches are saying and what's going on but this that you're hearing on air is the reality of your TV viewer you saw that that is.
[21:55.000 --> 22:05.000]  Something the AP was there covering with very proud of here's AP associated press and believe the AP is a mouth of US government cracks down on traders helping Russian troops.
[22:05.000 --> 22:11.000]  And then it goes on to say they post things saying they want Zelensky to make a deal.
[22:11.000 --> 22:15.000]  And that the majority of people in Ukraine are of Russian background.
[22:15.000 --> 22:26.000]  And that they think Zelensky stole the election that they don't like the fact that in eight years ago that the West admits they overthrew the elected president.
[22:26.000 --> 22:35.000]  And when you say that they come and take you to a slave camp for years of imprisonment torture and in many cases.
[22:35.000 --> 22:42.000]  Death these are the real images and when you understand this is all being directed that's even mainstream news.
[22:42.000 --> 22:46.000]  By the Pentagon.
[22:46.000 --> 22:49.000]  You understand that the terror.
[22:49.000 --> 22:51.000]  That is taking place.
[22:51.000 --> 22:53.000]  And going on you've seen.
[22:53.000 --> 22:56.000]  The war crimes so let's let's go over.
[22:56.000 --> 23:01.000]  Some of these headlines here that back all this up and tie it all together it's incredible information.
[23:01.000 --> 23:06.000]  But first understand that's what they plan to bring here.
[23:06.000 --> 23:12.000]  We don't have a major political awakening by successive approximation the deep states going to bring in the Ministry of Truth.
[23:12.000 --> 23:20.000]  Bring in all the censorship bring in the false flags start the arrest and try to disqualify many members of Congress that oppose it from even being in office.
[23:20.000 --> 23:26.000]  That's called dictatorship and Obama is in his third term now officially a dictator.
[23:26.000 --> 23:33.000]  I study the math I know the numbers Obama won his first election massively.
[23:33.000 --> 23:37.000]  People were sick of Bush and the wars and the rest of them that was a landslide for him.
[23:37.000 --> 23:39.000]  He was part of the same group.
[23:39.000 --> 23:46.000]  Neocon left his power axis and then he barely won the next time even though he ran against puppets both times.
[23:46.000 --> 23:52.000]  Trump won a massive landslide but they almost stole it from him in 2016.
[23:52.000 --> 23:57.000]  Biden lost massively but through election fraud you know the rest of the story.
[23:57.000 --> 24:02.000]  So Obama is running things that's even mainstream news.
[24:02.000 --> 24:05.000]  They call him the president they call him the acting president.
[24:05.000 --> 24:11.000]  He is a dictator and dictators call for intensified surveillance.
[24:11.000 --> 24:22.000]  That's what it is to censor it to surveil as well and to censor and they're establishing a censorship board that calls for the arrest of people that disagree with and for the EU model of arresting people.
[24:22.000 --> 24:29.000]  And that goes on all over the western world now except here in Australia they come arrest at your house for your speech.
[24:29.000 --> 24:33.000]  In the UK they do it for political correctness. In Germany it's massive.
[24:33.000 --> 24:36.000]  Many people they arrest they beat to death including medical doctors.
[24:36.000 --> 24:42.000]  It's here we need to recognize that we have been put into this tyranny or we will boil like the frog in the pot.
[24:42.000 --> 24:47.000]  The water is it boiling we have to jump out now.
[24:47.000 --> 24:58.000]  And if Congress doesn't act that understand there will be a cascade of coups to remove any Republicans that oppose them with things like the baseball field attack.
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  The attack on Rand Paul and the rest of it.
[25:00.000 --> 25:04.000]  So I understand that these men have done as best they think they can walking a tightrope.
[25:04.000 --> 25:10.000]  But you can't do that anymore because the new world order is making its move now because they know they've lost.
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  We are all in grave danger.
[25:12.000 --> 25:16.000]  Here is Obama.
[25:16.000 --> 25:21.000]  It's incredible clip.
[25:21.000 --> 25:24.000]  He says big tech doesn't go far enough in censorship.
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.000]  Hear it for yourself.
[25:26.000 --> 25:34.000]  Now the good news is is that almost all the big tech platforms now acknowledge some responsibility for content on their platforms.
[25:34.000 --> 25:39.000]  And they're investing in large teams of people to monitor it.
[25:39.000 --> 25:48.000]  Given the sheer volume of content this strategy can feel like a game of whack-a-mole.
[25:48.000 --> 26:02.000]  Still talking to people at these companies I believe they are sincere in trying to limit content that engages in hate speech encourages violence or poses a threat to public safety.
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.000]  They genuinely are concerned about it.
[26:04.000 --> 26:09.000]  They want to do something about it.
[26:09.000 --> 26:20.000]  But while content moderation can limit the distribution of clearly dangerous content it doesn't go far enough.
[26:20.000 --> 26:30.000]  And they go on to say in the groups they push forward in the federal government that anything they say is disinformation then can cause violence so you can be banned.
[26:30.000 --> 26:35.000]  And of course they define disinformation as well they are the biggest liars the planet's ever seen.
[26:35.000 --> 26:42.000]  Here's David Ziraki dangerous with Elon Musk buying Twitter we need to look to Europe.
[26:42.000 --> 26:50.000]  Total tyranny you need regulation you cannot let these guys control discourse in the country or we are headed to hell.
[26:50.000 --> 26:51.000]  They're bringing us to hell.
[26:51.000 --> 26:57.000]  You can't let us have discourse can't let them talk.
[26:57.000 --> 27:02.000]  Trump opened the gates of hell and now they're chasing us down.
[27:02.000 --> 27:05.000]  You know you're chasing us down.
[27:05.000 --> 27:07.000]  You're the one sitting pedophiles to the schools you're the ones open the borders.
[27:07.000 --> 27:09.000]  You're the one sterilizing little kids.
[27:09.000 --> 27:11.000]  You're the ones destroying everything.
[27:11.000 --> 27:14.000]  Everybody at the border everything and then you say when we don't like it we're bad.
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  Here he is.
[27:16.000 --> 27:24.000]  No I think there's a bigger problem that when we focus on the personalities of people like Elon Musk and people say oh I think Elon's thinking this or that.
[27:24.000 --> 27:31.000]  There's a bigger problem here about how we are going to control the channels of communication in this country.
[27:31.000 --> 27:42.000]  In 1927 we had the Radio Act 1934 the Communications Act Congress stepped in we made rules FCC wasn't great but it's still regulating the broadcast industry.
[27:42.000 --> 27:45.000]  You can't use vulgar language you can't do all these things with speech.
[27:45.000 --> 27:58.000]  We gave over our what amongst our airwaves or our internet waves to Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk and we are in so much trouble because those guys believe in making money.
[27:58.000 --> 28:08.000]  We've already seen that with the 2016 election in Zuckerberg when he was taking rubles for ads from Russia and say oh I think it's crazy to think they had any influence on this election.
[28:08.000 --> 28:09.000]  Musk is the same.
[28:09.000 --> 28:15.000]  Musk doesn't want you know he's upset with the SEC tried to dare they question them you know what I'm saying.
[28:15.000 --> 28:16.000]  This is dangerous.
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  We can't think anymore in this country.
[28:18.000 --> 28:25.000]  We don't have people no I'm serious we don't have people in Congress who can make regulations that can make it work.
[28:25.000 --> 28:29.000]  We can look to the Western countries in Europe for how they are trying to limit it.
[28:29.000 --> 28:32.000]  But you need you need controls on this.
[28:32.000 --> 28:33.000]  You need regulation.
[28:33.000 --> 28:38.000]  You cannot let these guys control discourse in this country or we are headed to hell.
[28:38.000 --> 28:39.000]  We are there.
[28:39.000 --> 28:43.000]  Trump opened the gates to hell and now they're chasing us down.
[28:43.000 --> 28:54.000]  There is a professor of media studies calling for the EU model like you're seeing right now in the mass arrest and putting people in prison not just in Ukraine but other nations for criticizing lockdowns.
[28:54.000 --> 28:55.000]  You name it.
[28:55.000 --> 28:56.000]  It's coming here now.
[28:56.000 --> 28:59.000]  Congress must act against it.
[28:59.000 --> 29:10.000]  The UN estimates that over two billion people alive on earth today have cognitive disabilities, lower IQs and so many other medical issues because of one thing iodine deficiency.
[29:10.000 --> 29:19.000]  And most iodine that you get from different foods is bound to other minerals or other compounds so it's not absorbable in the body.
[29:19.000 --> 29:21.000]  And that's why iodine deficiency is such a huge issue.
[29:21.000 --> 29:27.000]  We have the purest, cleanest, best iodine in the world from deep earth crystals worth 7000 feet deep.
[29:27.000 --> 29:31.000]  X2 is an amazing product and it has been sold out for months and months and months.

[30:13.000 --> 30:18.000]  They're about to be history and we're selling out of the hoodies, the ball caps, the t-shirts.

[31:37.000 --> 31:40.000]  And by the way, we've got our own NFTs at Arnescam.
[31:40.000 --> 31:43.000]  They're totally badass in total victory coming out next week.
[31:43.000 --> 31:44.000]  I'll tell you about that later.
[31:44.000 --> 31:49.000]  But right now M4warstore.com, Ford slash crypto, the real revolution is happening now.
[31:49.000 --> 31:52.000]  M4warstore.com, Ford slash crypto and always a donated.
[31:52.000 --> 32:20.000]  We salute you and thank you.
[32:20.000 --> 32:46.000]  Thank you.
[32:46.000 --> 33:01.000]  Thank you.
[33:01.000 --> 33:27.000]  Thank you.
[33:27.000 --> 33:29.000]  Look at this headline.
[33:29.000 --> 33:38.000]  Next CNN guest, a media professor who advises the Democrats says quote,
[33:38.000 --> 33:44.000]  How are we going to control the channels of communications in this country?
[33:44.000 --> 33:49.000]  And I played you a bunch of clips last week where they were all over the news saying,
[33:49.000 --> 33:52.000]  Well, we just can't let them talk to each other.
[33:52.000 --> 33:55.000]  They'll vote us out.
[33:55.000 --> 33:56.000]  And you heard them.
[33:56.000 --> 33:57.000]  They're coming for us.
[33:57.000 --> 33:58.000]  They're going to get us.
[33:58.000 --> 33:59.000]  They're unstoppable.
[33:59.000 --> 34:02.000]  What's the exact quote here?
[34:02.000 --> 34:05.000]  We cannot let these guys control discourse in this country.
[34:05.000 --> 34:07.000]  Are we are headed to hell?
[34:07.000 --> 34:09.000]  We are there.
[34:09.000 --> 34:15.000]  Trump opened the gates of hell and now they're chasing us down.
[34:15.000 --> 34:16.000]  They're the ones destroying the country.
[34:16.000 --> 34:18.000]  They're the ones in charge.
[34:18.000 --> 34:20.000]  And they're saying we're destroying them.
[34:20.000 --> 34:23.000]  No, you're minions of a system that's coming down.
[34:23.000 --> 34:27.000]  It's going to destroy you, professor.
[34:27.000 --> 34:28.000]  The food shortages.
[34:28.000 --> 34:31.000]  I have clips of Obama administration officials.
[34:31.000 --> 34:33.000]  I'm just going to start calling it the Obama administration is what it is.
[34:33.000 --> 34:41.000]  The Obama dictatorship, the third term, the third and elected term is what it is.
[34:41.000 --> 34:48.000]  And they're just up there saying that they've got to take over.
[34:48.000 --> 34:54.000]  They've got to silence all of us and that inflation is a good thing.
[34:54.000 --> 34:55.000]  And they start laughing at us.
[34:55.000 --> 35:01.000]  So you can look at the correspondence dinner where they make jokes and laugh about inflation.
[35:01.000 --> 35:02.000]  We've got those clips.
[35:02.000 --> 35:07.000]  But I've got another clip here where they have a Biden administration official.
[35:07.000 --> 35:14.000]  Again, third administration of Obama laughing and saying inflation is good.
[35:14.000 --> 35:16.000]  Again, they don't know when the French Revolution started.
[35:16.000 --> 35:20.000]  The Marie Antoinette really said when there were hundreds of thousands in the city starving to death
[35:20.000 --> 35:26.000]  and tens of thousands at the gates saying we need food, we're starving to death.
[35:26.000 --> 35:30.000]  And if she really said let them eat cake when they had giant granaries of food
[35:30.000 --> 35:33.000]  and up to feed them all for months.
[35:33.000 --> 35:37.000]  But they are actually saying let them eat cake.
[35:37.000 --> 35:40.000]  And their answer is surveillance and censorship.
[35:40.000 --> 35:42.000]  And then it's not going to work.
[35:42.000 --> 35:44.000]  And so then it'll be secret arrest and torture.
[35:44.000 --> 35:48.000]  And then in an armed country like this, it'll blow sky high,
[35:48.000 --> 35:51.000]  which is what globalist forces want.
[35:51.000 --> 35:57.000]  And then you'll get your world currency and you'll get all the controls after six months a year of civil war.
[35:57.000 --> 36:03.000]  So let me be one trillion percent clear.
[36:03.000 --> 36:06.000]  Let me be infinity clear.
[36:06.000 --> 36:09.000]  The last thing we want is any offensive violence.
[36:09.000 --> 36:12.000]  The last thing we want is blowing up federal buildings or shooting people.
[36:12.000 --> 36:14.000]  We're not the left that goes around burning things down.
[36:14.000 --> 36:19.000]  And the globalist provocateur obviously ran Oklahoma City.
[36:19.000 --> 36:21.000]  That is all they've got left.
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.000]  It's the only cards they have.
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.000]  And you can see them saying white people and Trump supporters are terrorist.
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.000]  And they're the number one terror threat.
[36:29.000 --> 36:35.000]  And just making up all this BS because they're building up towards those events.
[36:35.000 --> 36:39.000]  Just as sure as the sun came up this morning.
[36:39.000 --> 36:46.000]  And we need Congress to understand this and understand that this is not going to be
[36:46.000 --> 36:48.000]  like business as usual.
[36:48.000 --> 36:50.000]  But of course, when Mayorkas, the head of DHS was asked,
[36:50.000 --> 36:53.000]  give us one example of white supremacist terror in the last few years.
[36:53.000 --> 36:55.000]  Couldn't give one.
[36:55.000 --> 36:57.000]  Not one.
[36:57.000 --> 37:00.000]  Could you have some examples of black on white?
[37:00.000 --> 37:03.000]  Tens of thousands of horrific ones we know of.
[37:03.000 --> 37:04.000]  And that's not all black.
[37:04.000 --> 37:06.000]  People, it's not even a big minority.
[37:06.000 --> 37:11.000]  But it's a sizable minority of really hateful black supremacists that have been told by
[37:11.000 --> 37:14.000]  the media that whites deserve to be raped, robbed, killed, carjacked.
[37:14.000 --> 37:15.000]  You name it.
[37:15.000 --> 37:18.000]  And it's going on and it's still not 10 to 1 like it used to be black on white crime.
[37:18.000 --> 37:21.000]  It's over 20 to 1 in blue cities.
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  I've seen numbers as high as 30 to 1.
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  Everybody knows that.
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  So their answer is the exact opposite.
[37:27.000 --> 37:33.000]  Now do I blame black people in general because there is a sizable minority of black folks
[37:33.000 --> 37:37.000]  roaming at the mouth, race baiters because the media hyped them and brainwashed them
[37:37.000 --> 37:39.000]  and told them to do it?
[37:39.000 --> 37:41.000]  No, I don't.
[37:41.000 --> 37:45.000]  But that's the reality of these people and they want us divided and conquered and killing
[37:45.000 --> 37:49.000]  each other because their system is coming down in a controlled demolition to bring in
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.000]  the new system.
[37:51.000 --> 37:54.000]  They had to implode the old system, use it to get more power and control.
[37:54.000 --> 37:56.000]  Now they're bringing it down to bring in the new system.
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.000]  That's 100,000 times worse.
[37:58.000 --> 38:03.000]  Total surveillance, total control, cashless society, programmable tokens where the money
[38:03.000 --> 38:06.000]  tells you what you can do with it and how you can spend it and where you can go.
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  I mean, it is hell on earth.
[38:08.000 --> 38:13.000]  I'd have all the manuals and all the UN training plans going back 15 years and all the operation
[38:13.000 --> 38:16.000]  lock steps and all the planopolis programs and everything.
[38:16.000 --> 38:20.000]  We know exactly what it'll look like, how it'll run, what they're going to do.
[38:20.000 --> 38:22.000]  We have the whole damn plan.
[38:22.000 --> 38:30.000]  And I sit up here more than any other talk show host, Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, they're great.
[38:30.000 --> 38:37.000]  But they're not going to the final step of it's a huge world government takeover, corporate takeover
[38:37.000 --> 38:44.000]  because there is a pre-programmed demonization for decades of that information.
[38:44.000 --> 38:47.000]  So when they finally did it, everybody knows not to criticize it.
[38:47.000 --> 38:54.000]  And it's at that critical moment where we don't engage this and we don't fight this, that it's over.
[38:54.000 --> 38:59.000]  And by the way, Tucker does a lot slicker job than me and does actually cover all this in a very populous way.
[38:59.000 --> 39:01.000]  And he's gone further than anybody else in mainstream media.
[39:01.000 --> 39:06.000]  I'm just saying we have to call for action by the governors and the legislatures and the churches and everybody
[39:06.000 --> 39:09.000]  to just stand up and say, we know what you're doing.
[39:09.000 --> 39:10.000]  We know what you're planning.
[39:10.000 --> 39:12.000]  We don't want World War III.
[39:12.000 --> 39:13.000]  We don't want a collapsed dollar.
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  We don't want open borders.
[39:15.000 --> 39:16.000]  We don't want us into 2030.
[39:16.000 --> 39:22.000]  We don't want a nasty population.
[39:22.000 --> 39:28.000]  And that's all I'm saying is this is the globalist planned corporate world takeover for decades of the planning.
[39:28.000 --> 39:29.000]  We're here.
[39:29.000 --> 39:30.000]  We had all their training documents.
[39:30.000 --> 39:31.000]  They were so arrogant.
[39:31.000 --> 39:36.000]  And are you really going to let them do this to you and your family?
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  That is the big question.
[39:38.000 --> 39:43.000]  And one of my favorite pastors and not my favorite pastor, Rodney Howard Brown,
[39:43.000 --> 39:46.000]  has witnessed how the left takes over countries.
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  He's going to be joining us in the second hour.
[39:48.000 --> 39:52.000]  I'm going to then open the phones up in the third hour.
[39:52.000 --> 39:59.000]  And Joe Slund is in the fourth hour and then Owen Schreuer in the war room, 3 p.m. Central, and fullwars.com.
[39:59.000 --> 40:06.000]  Also, next segment have a really big, important announcement about victory and how to win and what's happening.
[40:06.000 --> 40:12.000]  And some very exciting newsmaking things that are extremely important that is coming up here.
[40:12.000 --> 40:15.000]  We're going to break in about three minutes.
[40:15.000 --> 40:19.000]  But let me start trying to get to some more of these clips since I mentioned them.
[40:19.000 --> 40:27.000]  Here is NBC's a sign saying that there's a neo-Nazi GOP group.
[40:27.000 --> 40:32.000]  And it's a pivotal moment that we all have to be basically censored.
[40:32.000 --> 40:34.000]  Here it is.
[40:34.000 --> 40:43.000]  I mean, it's easy in American discourse to talk simplistically about the far left and the far right as two equally dangerous fringe blocks.
[40:43.000 --> 40:46.000]  Elon Musk has done it plenty of times just in the past week.
[40:46.000 --> 40:47.000]  But here's the difference.
[40:47.000 --> 40:50.000]  America's far left wants to give us free healthcare and free childcare.
[40:50.000 --> 40:55.000]  America's far right wants to give us white supremacy and no democracy.
[40:55.000 --> 41:01.000]  And this asymmetrical polarization of U.S. politics would be laughable if it weren't so horrifying.
[41:01.000 --> 41:04.000]  We are living through an unspeakably dangerous moment.
[41:04.000 --> 41:11.000]  The pro-QAnon, pro-neo-Nazi faction of the Republican Party is poised to expand dramatically come the midterms.
[41:11.000 --> 41:16.000]  We're just two years away from Donald Trump, very possibly re-seizing executive power.
[41:16.000 --> 41:21.000]  If that happens, we may look back on this past week as a pivotal moment.
[41:21.000 --> 41:30.000]  When a petulant and not-so-bright billionaire casually bought one of the world's most influential messaging machines and just handed it to the far right.
[41:30.000 --> 41:36.000]  I'm joined now by Molly Zhong Fasti, contributing writer at The Atlantic and the author of The Weight What...
[41:36.000 --> 41:39.000]  There you go, branding all their opposition as Nazis.
[41:39.000 --> 41:49.000]  Let's play Clip 2 and 7, Biden talking about how inflation's funny and making jokes about it all.
[41:49.000 --> 41:55.000]  And then we'll play the clip of one of the officials in his administration.
[41:55.000 --> 42:01.000]  That's Clip 22, Biden official, Samantha Power celebrates fertilizer shortages.
[42:01.000 --> 42:06.000]  I mean, that's mass death guaranteed right there in the Third World and collapsing Third World to flood us.
[42:06.000 --> 42:09.000]  So let's play those clips back to back.
[42:09.000 --> 42:20.000]  I'm really excited to be here tonight with the only group of Americans with a lower prover rating than I have.
[42:20.000 --> 42:28.000]  I think ever since you've come into office, things are really looking up. Gas is up, rent is up, food is up, everything.
[42:28.000 --> 42:33.000]  No, it really has been a tough first year for you, Mr. President.
[42:33.000 --> 42:38.000]  Fertilizer shortages are real now because Russia is a big exporter of fertilizer.
[42:38.000 --> 42:43.000]  And even though fertilizer is not sanctioned, less fertilizer is coming out of Russia.
[42:43.000 --> 42:49.000]  As a result, we're working with countries to think about natural solutions like manure and compost.
[42:49.000 --> 42:54.000]  And this may hasten transitions that would have been in the interest of farmers to make eventually anyway.
[42:54.000 --> 43:00.000]  So never let a crisis go to waste, but we really do need this financial support from the Congress.
[43:00.000 --> 43:07.000]  The UN estimates that over 2 billion people alive on Earth today have cognitive disabilities, lower IQs,
[43:07.000 --> 43:11.000]  and so many other medical issues because of one thing, iodine deficiency.
[43:11.000 --> 43:20.000]  And most iodine that you get from different foods is bound to other minerals or other compounds, so it's not absorbable in the body.
[43:20.000 --> 43:22.000]  And that's why iodine deficiency is such a huge issue.
[43:22.000 --> 43:28.000]  We have the purest, cleanest, best iodine in the world from deep-earth crystals worth 7,000 feet deep.
[43:28.000 --> 43:32.000]  X2 is an amazing product, and it has been sold out for months and months and months.

[44:28.000 --> 44:34.000]  athletic performance, blood vessels, and more.

[44:59.000 --> 45:07.000]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[45:07.000 --> 45:13.000]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you're getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[45:13.000 --> 45:20.000]  This InfoWars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase from the InfoWars store.
[45:20.000 --> 45:27.000]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[45:27.000 --> 45:38.000]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[45:38.000 --> 45:46.000]  With vitamin C and zinc themselves you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[45:46.000 --> 45:53.000]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations like here in America.
[45:53.000 --> 46:09.000]  So next time you visit be sure to check it out at infowarsstore.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie.

[46:41.000 --> 46:51.000]  There is not a more politically incorrect shirt that sends a stronger message of freedom, resistance to the new world order than the Alex Jones was right shirt exclusively available at infowarsstore.com.
[46:51.000 --> 46:54.000]  And again, this shirt is limited edition as well.
[46:54.000 --> 47:22.000]  Bring one more run and then no more infowarsstore.com get yours today.
[47:54.000 --> 48:02.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[48:02.000 --> 48:10.000]  Coming up, another big fire at a giant food processing plant, Chesapeake Fire.
[48:10.000 --> 48:15.000]  It's industrial fire at Purdue Farms facility.
[48:15.000 --> 48:25.000]  It's happening every day at unprecedented statistical numbers, no way this is happening naturally.
[48:25.000 --> 48:28.000]  And it's happening in Russia and it's happening in Europe.
[48:28.000 --> 48:36.000]  Yeah, you're seeing extinction rebellion, the people that control that launch their attack.
[48:36.000 --> 48:41.000]  The globalist aren't just hitting medical research facilities they don't control now, they're hitting it all.
[48:41.000 --> 48:46.000]  This is the purposeful take now the borders, the infrastructure, education, everything.
[48:46.000 --> 49:00.000]  Orders are being given to Democrats and leftists worldwide that will destroy the social compact, the social contract, and that will annihilate goodwill between the people and the government.
[49:00.000 --> 49:04.000]  And the fools carrying this out think they're about to be part of a takeover.
[49:04.000 --> 49:09.000]  They're not taking over, they're destroying everything.
[49:09.000 --> 49:15.000]  All the billionaires that run it doubled their money in the last two years on average.
[49:15.000 --> 49:26.000]  Speaking of money, you have seen how there are hundreds of articles a day, dozens of national TV programs a day conservatively, can't even track it all.
[49:26.000 --> 49:36.000]  Saying Alex Jones is a criminal, Alex Jones is evil, Alex Jones needs to be shut down.
[49:36.000 --> 49:46.000]  And now we have these articles coming out from the statesman.com and the Washington Post and ABC News.
[49:46.000 --> 49:53.000]  Look at this headline, feds back Sandy Hook families in legal fight with Alex Jones.
[49:53.000 --> 50:01.000]  Now I learned about this when I declared limited chapter 11 bankruptcy for reorganization a week and a half ago.
[50:01.000 --> 50:08.000]  And the lawyers said wait till you talk about it because we want to get the transcript, this is so unbelievable.
[50:08.000 --> 50:11.000]  And we have it now.
[50:11.000 --> 50:24.000]  The head of the Justice Department agency directed them to contact the trustees who are retired judges.
[50:24.000 --> 50:33.000]  Because we went out and did the most standard clean thing you can do and have outside groups coming in that are highly respected and told them,
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  quote, you are not to help Alex Jones.
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  They said we've never gotten a call like this, what do you mean?
[50:37.000 --> 50:38.000]  Everybody has access to the courts.
[50:38.000 --> 50:39.000]  They said no.
[50:39.000 --> 50:43.000]  It is the policy of the Biden administration that no one is to help Alex Jones.
[50:43.000 --> 50:51.000]  And then they're in the news saying I'm a criminal for going into federal court and then I've come to the deep state for help.
[50:51.000 --> 50:56.000]  No, those are the courts and the people to say there's all these lies about us and then we have hundreds of millions of dollars.
[50:56.000 --> 51:00.000]  We don't have five million dollars.
[51:00.000 --> 51:05.000]  And that I'm going to be investigated for this.
[51:05.000 --> 51:06.000]  Okay, great.
[51:06.000 --> 51:07.000]  Plant whatever you want.
[51:07.000 --> 51:08.000]  It's all a lie.
[51:08.000 --> 51:12.000]  I'm sick of the media putting out this information about us.
[51:12.000 --> 51:18.000]  I'm tired of these controlled state courts where they file the political operatives that they openly control.
[51:18.000 --> 51:27.000]  And so I've gone to a respected bankruptcy judge in Texas and said, come check it out.
[51:27.000 --> 51:28.000]  Send in.
[51:28.000 --> 51:31.000]  We told the court the court can send not just trustees.
[51:31.000 --> 51:32.000]  The court can come in here.
[51:32.000 --> 51:34.000]  They can see everything.
[51:34.000 --> 51:38.000]  I gave all this to the San Diego people in a defamation case was ordered to.
[51:38.000 --> 51:47.000]  And then I was defaulted and they said I gave them nothing and or fake information really proved that because we did.
[51:47.000 --> 51:48.000]  Number one, I know I'm a major target.
[51:48.000 --> 51:50.000]  We run a very clean ship here.
[51:50.000 --> 51:53.000]  Number two, I'm a good guy and I don't engage in fraud.
[51:53.000 --> 52:01.000]  And that's the next thing we got a little over a million dollar donation last week from a Bitcoin whale.
[52:01.000 --> 52:04.000]  I want to think again on the air and I sat on there.
[52:04.000 --> 52:08.000]  I said we raised a million dollars last week and the money drive, but most of it was products.
[52:08.000 --> 52:10.000]  We made about $500,000.
[52:10.000 --> 52:17.000]  I said we need about two and a half million dollars just to buy product this year to keep funding ourselves with the product.
[52:17.000 --> 52:19.000]  If not, I've got to start deciding what we're going to do.
[52:19.000 --> 52:30.000]  I told you that on air and then you notice a few days later it broke from the SPLC that spies on us that terrorist organization of you.
[52:30.000 --> 52:34.000]  Anonymous donor drops one million in Bitcoin on Alex Jones.
[52:34.000 --> 52:38.000]  And I told you last week.
[52:38.000 --> 52:42.000]  And they act like ooh, we caught him.
[52:42.000 --> 52:46.000]  Oh my gosh, we caught Alex Jones.
[52:46.000 --> 52:51.000]  Oh my gosh, he's so bad in his bankruptcy filing.
[52:51.000 --> 52:54.000]  You know, he said he sells merchandise to fund himself.
[52:54.000 --> 52:55.000]  How evil is that?
[52:55.000 --> 52:58.000]  And then I have the first amendment even worse.
[52:58.000 --> 52:59.000]  Well, guess what?
[52:59.000 --> 53:00.000]  You must have made the donor mad.
[53:00.000 --> 53:02.000]  I don't know who they are, where they are.
[53:02.000 --> 53:05.000]  They could be in Japan, could be in the U.S., could be who knows where.
[53:05.000 --> 53:06.000]  I appreciate them.
[53:06.000 --> 53:10.000]  Whoever they are, bought hundreds of millions of dollars of Bitcoin at a lower price.
[53:10.000 --> 53:16.000]  Back in 2016, never spent any of them and is now giving us a million dollars of Bitcoin.
[53:16.000 --> 53:25.000]  And you must have upset them, whoever they are, because sorry to the left and the globalist, they gave us a million dollars more on Saturday.
[53:25.000 --> 53:30.000]  Let me break that for you while you sit there and say we're covering it all up and hiding it in bank accounts and all this crap.
[53:30.000 --> 53:38.000]  So, we no longer have three million dollars in the company, barely enough to make payroll and operate my product.
[53:38.000 --> 53:40.000]  We now have five million dollars.
[53:40.000 --> 53:48.000]  And we're going to follow all that with the bankruptcy court too, before they can run into it and say we're hiding money.
[53:48.000 --> 53:50.000]  Because that's what these liars do.
[53:50.000 --> 53:53.000]  Everything they say about us is what they are doing.
[53:53.000 --> 54:03.000]  And then that money, when the court sees, is enough to run this place, they won't be able to say I've got hundreds of millions of dollars until a Texas jury under default,
[54:03.000 --> 54:07.000]  that this man's already guilty, he's not allowed to talk at trial, that's been filed by the judge.
[54:07.000 --> 54:14.000]  He can have no defense, this is their new system, and he's got a hundred million dollars.
[54:14.000 --> 54:16.000]  No, I don't.
[54:16.000 --> 54:23.000]  I've got four hundred thousand dollars in my personal account and that's just enough to pay bills and my own personal legal bills.
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.000]  And I'm not even into money.
[54:25.000 --> 54:29.000]  I don't dislike having a nice car, be able to fly first class, whatever, but I don't do what I do for money.
[54:29.000 --> 54:32.000]  They can offer me ten million dollars, I wouldn't sell out to them.
[54:32.000 --> 54:39.000]  But thank God for the people getting upset and angry and understanding that we're going to lose everything if we don't all start standing up.
[54:39.000 --> 54:48.000]  And the wealthy people out there need to know that you're a fraction of the people that have supported InfoWars and it's mom and pops and common hard work and folks that have been doing it.
[54:48.000 --> 55:00.000]  And I've asked the people with wealth out there to step up to the plate and go to infowars.com forward slash crypto and choose more than 20 ways you can donate right there.
[55:00.000 --> 55:11.000]  And the funds will go into this operation to keep the crew employed, to keep our journalism going, to keep warning the people of modern Paul Revere's and to fight these legal battles.
[55:11.000 --> 55:23.000]  Because the two and a half million dollars that have come in extra in the last two weeks is just enough to buy the product into the future to make the money to then pay for all the crew and the uplinks and the bandwidth and the legal.
[55:23.000 --> 55:33.000]  So we need to still have people buying product and everything just to stay on track when you've taken us from the red right up to the black and it's God again like the widows might.
[55:33.000 --> 55:41.000]  Every day she'd wake up and enough oil, enough grain for her and her daughter to feed themselves and not starve was there all because they gave the profit.
[55:41.000 --> 55:46.000]  I'm not saying I'm a prophet, but this is the Bible story. The profit when he was hungry, they gave everything they had.
[55:46.000 --> 55:53.000]  And so God just kept refilling it right as they needed it. And the archetype of that, whether you believe the story is true or not, is that's how God works.
[55:53.000 --> 55:59.000]  And I have experienced that where I was on air saying we need two and a half million dollars just to get solving.
[55:59.000 --> 56:06.000]  And it came in a little donations, big donations. It all comes together and I would love to have even more money in my work.
[56:06.000 --> 56:17.000]  We could do so much more, but God's working through you. So please keep going to infowarstore.com, eating great products, great books, films, t-shirts, supplements, shortwave radios, just thousands of great items.
[56:17.000 --> 56:37.000]  infowarstore.com or call toll free, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. We also have a lot of folks write in and make donations at P.O. Box one, nine, five, four, nine, Austin, Texas, seven, eight, seven, six, zero.
[56:37.000 --> 56:48.000]  We're taking the time to do that because listen, I am not going to back down. I physically can't do it and I'm not going to give up, but I could like a horse that's been rodent too hard collapse.
[56:48.000 --> 56:56.000]  And so thank you for giving us hope to keep fighting on because I was coming down the line with really important decisions to make about what we were going to do.
[56:56.000 --> 57:14.000]  Either not order more products, sell out what we have, have enough funds for six, seven, eight months and then implode or do Lord, I mean, do Lord knows what? I mean, I had no other option or start laying everybody off now and imploding the showdown, you know, with a smaller crew and not putting out all the video reports and letting go all the great people like
[57:14.000 --> 57:27.000]  Greg Reese and, you know, so many others and I just don't want to do that. That's important work we're doing. So thank you for believing in us. We believe in you and you've got my commitment to fight even harder and never back down and I salute you and I thank you.
[57:27.000 --> 57:33.000]  And I think the individual know your man, a woman, old, young, black, white, I don't know who you are, but thank you for what you've done.
[57:33.000 --> 57:45.000]  We've been contacted by some other very interesting high powered people since then saying they want to come in and help as well because they understand there's a key battle for the future happening in Info Wars and the enemy sees that and wants to take down the standard of freedom.
[57:45.000 --> 57:49.000]  But we're not going to let them do it. Thank you so much.
[57:49.000 --> 58:05.000]  You see this? It's an Info Wars Republic Defense Card with original Info Wars art designed by yours truly with a little gold bar implanted in it and on the back it's got a hologram. There are only 25,000 of these in existence and they'll never be made again.
[58:05.000 --> 58:16.000]  The bank that owns the Mint that has started putting these out the last few years just sold out of 300,000 of a similar offering that was 40% more than what we're selling these for.
[58:16.000 --> 58:25.000]  And when you get three or more you can get these at 50% off and they fund the Info War. Please visit infowarstore.com and check out this amazing new art slash gold product.
[58:25.000 --> 58:31.000]  It's a collector's item and you'll know you help fund the Second American Revolution against the globalist at such a critical point.

[1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  During the 1990s, Monsanto Corporation's devastating attack against farmers, their genetically modified franken foods, and their neurotoxic pesticides, inspired people to push government into legislating certification standards for foods.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  But thanks to big pharma, Bill Gates and pop culture media brainwashing, Monsanto still stands strong and is ready to take complete control of your food supply, with the help of the same powerful families and foundations who already control the money and the energy.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  Their plans to do so are comprehensively laid out in a recent report published at Corey Diggs. The indoor vertical farming industry, which is a highly innovative and efficient method, is being funded by Bill Gates and pushed by the World Economic Forum as a replacement to conventional outdoor farming.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  Aeropharms is the industry leader in vertical farming, and they also co-developed the first CRISPR gene-edited produce product, and worked with the NIH to produce proteins for the deadly COVID vaccines.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  Aeropharms makes it clear that they are not conventional gardeners. They are all about synthetic food products, which is clearly the trend in this growing industry. Monsanto is creating specially tailored genetically cut seed for these vertical farms.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  And the University of California is developing a plant-based mRNA vaccine that farms can grow in heads of lettuce, which happens to be the main crop of these new farms.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  These GMO farms already provide food at major outlets including Kroger, Walmart, and Whole Foods, and are massively expanding.
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  And it's not only fresh produce that's getting genetically modified. The USDA and FDA have already approved genetic modifications on pigs, salmon, and cattle.
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  And they have approved synthetic lab-grown meat. Bill Gates' Good Food Institute plans to reimagine meat production with $10 million of support from the USDA.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  But in order to make their big farm of food supply the new American model, they will need a major crisis.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  The 2020 lockdowns distressed the supply chain, which was further affected by US sanctions against Russia. This has created a food shortage crisis.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  Add to that, over a dozen food processing plants have mysteriously been destroyed in the past several weeks, as well as major fertilizer plants during a major fertilizer crisis.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  To make matters worse, Union Pacific Railroad forces a 20% reduction in shipments from the world's largest fertilizer company.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  And when the people demand a solution, as it turns out, Bill Gates is heavily invested in alternative fertilizers, and is also a chief stockholder of the Canadian National Railway, who claims to be helping the fertilizer market grow.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  Perhaps Bill Gates and Monsanto will volunteer to save everyone with their new gene-edited bacteria fertilizer.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  And maybe it will backfire like it did in Africa, when after 15 years of trying to help, all Gates and Monsanto accomplished was increasing starvation by 31%.
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  But that's okay, because it's Monsanto bear to the rescue with their big pharma food factories, with brand new mRNA vaccine lettuce.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  And as if this wasn't bad enough, the stated goal of this new franken food industry is to make all food traceable, and that means coding it all in nanotech.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  Who controls the food supply controls the people. Who controls the energy can control whole continents. Who controls money can control the world.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:10.000]  The UN estimates that over 2 billion people alive on Earth today have cognitive disabilities, lower IQs, and so many other medical issues because of one thing, iodine deficiency.
[1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  And most iodine that you get from different foods is bound to other minerals or other compounds, so it's not absorbable in the body.
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  And that's why iodine deficiency is such a huge issue.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  We have the purest, cleanest, best iodine in the world from Deep Earth crystals more than 7,000 feet deep. X2 is an amazing product, and it has been sold out for months and months and months.
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  It is now back in stock at infowarsstore.com for 25% off.
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, with all the supply chain breakdowns and the rest of it, I'm not sure when the next time we're going to get X2 is.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  So I would stock up on X2 right now at infowarsstore.com and know that you're funding the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalist.

[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  We are broadcasting worldwide in defiance of tyranny and the love of liberty, and I was talking to one of my favorite people, and definitely my favorite pastor, Rodney Howard Brown, who has a giant church in Florida,
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  but mainly travels the world hundreds of times a year talking to millions.
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  And I said, I'm seeing a massive awakening and revival in people that don't even go to church saying it's good versus evil, God's real, Mark of the Beast.
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  My mom went with some family friends to a mega church in North Austin with tens of thousands of people.
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  They had people out in the parking lot on Jumbotrons on Easter, and it was just the new world orders here, Mark of the Beast, world government, got to stop them.
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  And I know people that went to that church just a few years ago, they weren't talking like that.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  So people are really starting to get it.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  And so I was talking to Pastor Brown this weekend, and I said, are you seeing what I'm seeing?
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  And he said, yes, and he gave me a report that was so powerful.
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  And I said, can you come on there and say that again and then cover the waterfront with Biden and the war and the open borders and the franken food and the microchips to buy and sell.
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  I mean, it's all out in the open now, we are so vindicated.
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  Unfortunately, I wish we could have stopped it before it all went to the next phase, but at least people are partially awake now.
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown was born in Port Elizabeth, South Africa and grew up in the Eastern Cape.
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  Rodney and his wife came to America with $300 in their suitcase and three children in 87.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  And under the banner of revival ministries international, they have now reached hundreds of millions of people conservatively and led them to the Lord.
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  They travel 46 weeks out of the year, revival.com.
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  They joined us for the balance of the hour.
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  We salute you, my friend, because in these dark times, the light of Christ is always that much brighter.
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  Thank you so much, sir.
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  Alex, it's so great to be with you.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  And as I said to you, many people will never know the price that you've paid to get these truths out.
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  Whether people like it or not, unfortunately, the facts are the facts.
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  And as you know, we're being dealt a ministry of truth now, which only a few people in the last 100 years have had that and it didn't turn out well for that society.
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  So I know you're under major tech, but I pray for you every day that God help you.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  Thank you, sir.
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  I really appreciate your when you reach out with those prayers and reach out with your text and calls.
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  Where do you want to start?
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  I mean, what you said was so powerful me on the text messages and audio messages was really buoyed my spirit.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  Can you report to folks what you're saying?
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  OK, so here's the big thing of the lockdown in the past two years.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  What they should have done was shut off the Internet because people started to search and more people became awake to actually what's going on behind the scenes.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  So what you started out, Alex, all those years ago, started to tell people of what was coming.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  People begin to invest again, begin to realize that, no, this is not a conspiracy theory.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  This is a conspiracy fact.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  But here's what I realized.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  And of course, because this is my job, the gospel of Jesus Christ is the solution to any society.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  So if you go back in history and you look at the 1700, 1800, if you go back to England mid 1750, 1740, the whole of the U.K.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  They were drunkards.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  They were into witchcraft.
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  They were sacrificed.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  There was slavery was an all-time high and whatever.
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  And then that great revival that started with the Westleys that really shook and turned the tide in the United Kingdom, jumped upon, came to the United States.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  That actually caused these 13 colonies here to become one nation under God and the birth of the United States of America.
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  And I know there's a lot of people, they hate America, but I've traveled 85 countries.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  This is the greatest place on the planet.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  That's why they wanted to take America down.
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  But this passage from Luke chapter four, I think, explains it.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  I'm going to tell you, I just did a tour last week.
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  I was in Long Island and then went on to Pennsylvania and then West Virginia and then on to Pittsburgh.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  So we did a little dip down and they went up to Pittsburgh for two nights.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  Places were packed standing only and nobody would leave even 11 o'clock at night.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  I mean, the service starts at 7 and 11.
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  I tell people, we're going to end the service.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  They go, no, we'll kidnap you.
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  We'll arrest you again.
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  And so people are hungry.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  They're hungry for God.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  We had overflow rooms that people started leaving at about 10 to 12 in the one place.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  So I filled the building at midnight.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  I filled the building from the overflow.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  Nobody wants to leave.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  But this passage is what jumped in my spirit that I wanted to share with you.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  This is from the words of Jesus.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  It's from Luke's Gospel chapter four.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  Jesus, the Bible says in verse 14, it says here,
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  then Jesus went back full of power of the Holy Spirit in the Galilee.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  And the fame of him spread throughout the whole region round about,
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  which is that's why they want to shut the church down and shut the gospel
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  because they know that the gospel brings the solution to the problems that man is facing.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  He said, and he conducted a course of teaching in the synagogue,
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  being recognized and honored and praise the ball.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  He came to Nazareth, that Nazareth where he'd been brought up.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  And as he entered the synagogue and as was his custom on the Sabbath day,
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  he stood up for the read.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  And there was handed unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  And he unrolled the book and he found the place was written.
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  The spirit of the Lord is upon me because he have anointed me to preach the gospel.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  It says here, the anointed one, the Messiah, has anointed,
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  God has anointed me to preach the good news, the gospel to the poor,
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  which the poor are so in need right now.
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  He has sent me to heal the broken hearted and he has sent me to announce release to the captors,
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those or set forth delivered those who are oppressed.
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  I'm actually quoting two translations here between the King James and the Amplified Classic,
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  who are downtrodden, bruised, crushed and broken down by calamity, the Amplified Classic says,
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  to proclaim the acceptable and accepted he of the Lord,
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  the day when salvation and the free favors of God profusely abound.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  So there's many people say, well, that was for Bible days.
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  No, the gospel is relevant today.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  So Klaus Schwab, World Economic Forum, United Nations,
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  knew that we have to shut the church down.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  We have to lock the church down.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  And we've got to stop congregations from gathering because that's a place of community.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  And the Bible even tells us, don't forsake the gathering of yourselves together,
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  even the much more when you see the day approaching.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  And they shut down retirement homes, assisted living homes,
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  which we go in there and pray for people right before they die.
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  They shut down the schools, which just like, you know, all of that's opening up for us.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  We in there right now, we slamming it.
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:14:00.000]  I think last week we had 500 people in senior assisted living homes pray the prayer to accept Christ.
[1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  So, you know, like you were on to this many, many years ago, Alex,
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  and of course I listened to you, I was delivered this package back in 05.
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  This is a pandemic flu preparedness kit.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  This was given and made by the Department of the Department of Deficiency,
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  Department of the Feds, the Deficiaries, pandemic flu preparedness kit.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  And inside it is the two N95 respirators, four surgical masks,
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  and one hand sanitizer bottle, which I never did open.
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  But on the back it says, there is no influenza pandemic gift.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  Local health and government authorities will notify you.
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  But this last week, I was showing it so many times that the sanitizer started leaking out.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  So I actually opened it publicly in the servers and I was shocked at what I found in.
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  Of course, I found in it Purell hand sanitizer in the package.
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  All right, this is 2005.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:08.000]  Inside here, we have two N95 masks, all right, and then we've got these surgical masks.
[1:15:08.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  And very interesting, made in China.
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  And all this package was put together in Vancouver, Washington.
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  If you remember, Vancouver, Washington was the first people in America to get infected with coronavirus.
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  Then I opened this. Wow, was I in for it?
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:26.000]  Stay there.
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  I want to come back and get to this because it's crazy.
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  We didn't talk about this, but I was going to go there.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  The UN plan now being launched by Obama to take over all the medical responses,
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  the world government documents.
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  It's all happening in late May.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  And I think that's probably where you're going.
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  I'm guessing we'll be right back with Pastor Brown to go over all of this
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  because this is their UN world government takeover using the biomedical system.
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  And Congress is hardly even talking about it.
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  I've got a whole folder on this today.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  And Brown didn't even know I was going to go there.
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  It looks like that's where he's going.
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  You see this?
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:04.000]  It's an Info Wars Republic Defense Card with original Info Wars art designed by yours truly
[1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  with a little gold bar implanted in it.

[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  There are only 25,000 of these in existence, and they'll never be made again.
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  The bank that owns the Mint that has started putting these out the last few years,
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  just sold out of 300,000 of a similar offering that was 40% more than what we're selling these for.
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:29.000]  And when you get three or more, you can get these at 50% off and they fund the Info War.

[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:47.000]  The real revolution is happening now.

[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  Over the years, info wars has produced more than 200 amazing patriot Americana, second amendment pro-liberty themed t-shirts, ball caps, flags, you name it.
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  All of the apparel and the flags are being sold at cost right now.
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:17.000]  That's just regular plain chain shirts.
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:23.000]  That is all sorts of designer shirts that cost us $15, $20, $25 to produce.
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  We used to sell for $40.
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  We're selling them for $15, selling them for $20.
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  Remember, the shirt costs us.
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:32.000]  If a shirt costs $5, we're selling it for $5 for us to actually produce.
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  It costs $10 or selling it for $10.
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  And we've got hoodies, and we've got long sleeves, and we've got short sleeves.
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  We've got them all, and we've got to liquidate them all.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  And they're limited edition because we're never going to make any of these designs again.
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:50.000]  We are going to come out with some new designs that will be limited and limited edition in the future.
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  We've got to sell this to keep M4s on the air, plus it spreads the word infowarstore.com.
[1:19:55.000 --> 1:19:58.000]  Here historic apparel now, infowarstore.com.
[1:19:58.000 --> 1:20:27.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  Well renowned pastor Rodney Howard Brown of Revival.com is our guest for the rest of the hour,
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  and I always love where he takes us.
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:47.000]  We don't talk about ways to talk about before he comes on very much.
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:51.000]  He's bringing up from a 2014-15 Homeland Security pandemic package.
[1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  I know we can trace back to Obama and then right before he left office signing executive orders,
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  changing the law to basically arrest anybody, an executive order wouldn't pass by Congress,
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:03.000]  who they say even might be sick.
[1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:06.000]  So this is definitely their power grab mode, and it's all official now.
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  And I'm guessing where you're going with this.
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:11.000]  So for those that just joined us who were going through this packet,
[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:16.000]  that you finally opened after seven years, just a few days ago, please continue.
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  Actual fact, this is from O5, Alex.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  Oh, okay, I missed spoke.
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  Wow, O5, excuse me.
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:27.000]  So I mean, that's what's even more shocking about it, but everything's made in China,
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  and it's all produced through the Vancouver office, which is such fine print here,
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:39.000]  but manufactured, it says here, manufactured by First Aid Only Inc.
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  11101 Northeast 37th Circle, Vancouver, Washington,
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  and it's called FirstAidOnly.com, made in China.
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  Everything's made in China.
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  So this was all planned.
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  And if you remember, Vancouver was the first site.
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  Remember, they announced, I think, three people contracted COVID-19 with Vancouver, Washington.
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  That's where everything came.
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  So I was shocked when I unveiled it.
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  I told the whole congregation where I was preaching up in Pittsburgh,
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  I said, this is like unveiling Tutankhamun's tomb,
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  because I got these in October of O5, and I've never opened it.
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  So I opened it up, and it looked, you know, everything that's on the front cover is on there.
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  So I opened it up.
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  It immediately goes, avoid people with the flu.
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:24.000]  When the flu is in your community, stay at home.
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  If you can't avoid crowds, you must go out, consider wearing a mask.
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  Try to keep six feet away from people who are coughing or sneezing.
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:35.000]  Most people catch the flu by coming into contact with droplets or cough or sneezes.
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:40.000]  Wash your hands, warm, soapy water, alcohol-based, all the stuff that they planned to plan.
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  Food, water, gas, electricity, transportation, or maybe disrupted for periods of time,
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  which you actually see now.
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:51.000]  This is not only being disrupted, but it's being done on purpose.
[1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:55.000]  All the food supplies that are being destroyed, which I've got another whole thing.
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  Alex, we're growing here. We're getting everybody to grow.
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  And I can show you what we're doing here.
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  This is medical care and access to non-prescription,
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:05.000]  and prescription medication may be limited.
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  That's why everybody needs your health products that you're making available
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  so people can boost their immune systems.
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  Schools may close for one to three months.
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  If you plan for childcare, if schools are closed, kids should not gather in large groups.
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  Check with your employer if you can work from home, which that was all they planned
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  was to drive people out of the marketplace.
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  If you're sick, stay at home, cover your nose and mouth.
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  And it goes all through, yeah, depending on how severe the pandemic is.
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:35.000]  You may be requested to stay at home if you have sick family members.
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  If you can, designate one family Medicare for those who are sick with the flu,
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  which I don't understand how the healthy keep themselves whole.
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  If you don't just do what you have done for centuries, then it goes on to Tokyo.
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  They talk about masks. The kit has two supplies of masks.
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:55.000]  And then it says a mask does not guarantee protection.
[1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:57.000]  It would reduce but not limit the risk.
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  The best protection limit is your contact with sick people.
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:03.000]  So in other words, anybody who's sick, just stay away from them,
[1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  which was the whole fear thing that they wanted to drive everybody.
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:09.000]  And if somebody who's sick doesn't get health care from anything regular,
[1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  they might die exactly. So they knew what they were doing.
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  This is amazing find from 2005. Wow.
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  And I remember back under Bush then they were talking about national pandemics
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  and using that as a power grab then, but then the public didn't buy it.
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  Okay, so we've got somebody doing the research and I will send you all what they found out.
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  We've got Bush actually on video talking about how he was going to quarantine whole cities in America.
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  We've got Bush on video talking about how the United Nations task force were going to work.
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  And I actually warned everybody. I have two clips that I could play,
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  but it's me much larger because I lost a lot of weight, but from 2005.
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  So people can see I'm not making this stuff up here.
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  But basically they're saying you should have ibuprofen and some methanol,
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  thermometer, rehydration solution, household bleach, disinfection, cell phones,
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  radios, batteries, supply of face masks, plastic gloves, whatever.
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  And a two week supply of food, remember 15 days to slow the spread.
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  And then at the back here, I'll send you one of these packages.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  I have a few more. I will overnight your package so you can open it yourself.
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  This is the second one. I left the first one with the investigative reporter.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:25.000]  This one I brought home and then I opened it last night and I'll send you one
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  so that you can see for yourself. You can hold it in your hands.
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  This is smoking. This is smoking gun.
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  Because the first time I saw the plan for the 15 days to slow the spread
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  and wear the mask and all of that was in the Rockefeller Foundation
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  Operation Lockstep 2011, you got something from six, seven years before
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  that is word for word what they did in 2020.
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  Which is shocking to me because I never did open it.
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  Because I thought, well, I already know about the pandemic. Why would I open it?
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  But the stuff started leaking out in one of my sister's bags.
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  It was dripping all of the hand sanitizer.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:03.000]  So I said, OK, I don't want to spoil these bags.
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  I said, let's open it publicly here.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  And when I opened it, when I saw Made in China, when I saw it from
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  Vancouver, Washington, when I started reading all of this stuff
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  for the 15 days and the masks.
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  They've been planning this a long, long time as their power grab
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  and now officially they're announcing the UN to take over our pandemic response.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  Everything. So now what they were, OK, now let me just say this on the other side
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  because we've got to have a little positive here because not all negative.
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  They have failed largely in many instances and I'll tell you where they failed.
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  They failed in America because what they thought was America was one country
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  that would just shut down.
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  But they didn't realize that we have 50 states that are sovereign
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  and they didn't realize the spirit of America.
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  Now there are countries in the EU that are pretty much gone.
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  I mean, a short of divine intervention.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  I don't know how they're going to turn themselves around.
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  But America and here in the state of Florida, Alex, listen.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  So they're coming off to the water, they're coming off to the energy,
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  they're coming off to the field, they're coming off to the food supply
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:12.000]  and all of this stuff is being designed because then they can drive the people
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  to bread lines and they can say to you, you will take these shots.
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  You will comply.
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  And of course, everything's to do with the vaccine passport where you can't
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  buy or sell or travel or whatever.
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  So it is actually, it's an exciting time to be alive.
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  I'm watching the Bible come to life right in front of me.
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  And but I do believe that we have time.
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  I believe we do have time left.
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  And that's why we've got to preach the gospel because the only hope is Jesus.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  A lot of the people that are out there that are caught up in wickedness,
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  some have no clue what they're doing.
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  But there are others, the sinister ones that are behind the scenes,
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  they know exactly what they're doing.
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  Everything is by design.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  So you've got the wicked that are using what we call, and that sounds terrible,
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  but it's a communistic term.
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  They're using useful idiots.
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  All the people that are in compliance, they say, oh, we're going to go with popular opinion.
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  They will be the first ones that will be taken out when these people get control
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  on what they want to.
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  But Alex, the body of Christ is here.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  We understand the spirit of Antichrist is ripe in the earth today.
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  But this is the hour.
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  And I want to say this to the listener.
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  This is the hour of the body of Christ.
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  This is the hour of the church.
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  This is the hour of the pastors and ministers to get bold and to stand in the pulpit
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  and to preach this word and to believe this word, believe it literally.
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:35.000]  If you're not going to believe it literally, why even be in the ministry?
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  If you're going to sit and argue about the scripture where the dog meant it, it's true.
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  It is true.
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  Pastor, stay there.
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  Stay there.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  Everything's being fulfilled.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  They're announcing one world government, Margaret the Beast, everywhere.
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  The EU announced you'll buy and sell without this new carbon credit, which they also sale double
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  as the vaccine passport.
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  It's all happening.
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:29:23.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:52.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:29:52.000 --> 1:30:18.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:44.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:30:44.000 --> 1:31:10.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:31:10.000 --> 1:31:36.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:31:36.000 --> 1:32:02.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:28.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:57.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:32:59.000 --> 1:33:22.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:28.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:34.000]  Well, every time Pastor Rodney Howard Brown, the revival.com comes on, he breaks some major
[1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:35.000]  news.
[1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  I learned to come on about the big revival happening and so much more had in my stack.
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:42.000]  Now they're planning to bring in this world ID and they have this big world government
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:46.000]  event that's about to happen in just about two weeks.
[1:33:46.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  Such huge news we're going to cover with him.
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  And I want to ask him some personal questions about Info Wars and what his advice is for
[1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  myself and the audience out there and the power of prayer.
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  But before we get into this other news and I get your take on it, what else is on your
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  radar screen front and center, Pastor?
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:05.000]  Okay.
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:07.000]  So, of course, I'm a preacher.
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  So my whole thing is the gospel.
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:10.000]  Get people safe.
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  We are mobilizing right now.
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:15.000]  We're hitting 67 counties in the state of Florida.
[1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:17.000]  I've got teams that are moving around.
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  We're hitting every high school.
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:19.000]  We're hitting universities.
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:21.000]  It's amazing what's happening.
[1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:26.000]  I think last week was over 3,000 people they prayed with in the different entities that
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  I'm mentioning to you.
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  So we have to, we have to, I'm telling every believer that's watching me right now.
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  You might have a full-time job and you might be busy, but every day you've got to tell
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:39.000]  somebody about Jesus and you have to tell them that he's coming soon.
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  I beg you, this is the only time you'll ever hear me beg.
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:45.000]  You know, I don't beg for money.
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  I'm not out looking for money.
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  Money's out looking for me.
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  But I'm not worried about that.
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:57.000]  I am on a quest to let everybody know that we are closer to the end now than ever before.
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  And the only hope is Jesus, which is very important.
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  The second thing that I woke up with, and I actually talked about it last year, and
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  of course I've heard you speak about it.
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:09.000]  I live on 26 acres.
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:10.000]  I have my own cattle.
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  I have Angus herd.
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:13.000]  I've got my own sheep now.
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  St. Croix sheep.
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:18.000]  And I've also just done a land lease to expand the cattle herd.
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:23.000]  I just brought 23 dozen eggs to the ministry today to give away to people because my chickens
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  are laying so many eggs.
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  But my whole thing was growing.
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  And I've been talking about it.
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:33.000]  And I have people in my congregation that have four, five, six acres and others are growing.
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:35.000]  But I felt that we had to do it as a ministry.
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:39.000]  So we took five acres eight weeks ago and we put it under agriculture.
[1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  So if you can put the pictures up and put the clips up.
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:47.000]  Alex, we probably have 40,000 plants already in the ground right now.
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  We have seven different kinds of corn.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:50.000]  We're doing everything.
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  And it's all going to be climate controlled.
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  We've got the greenhouses.
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  That's going to be for chefs and restaurants.
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  We're growing.
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:36:03.000]  And I've got 300 varieties of tomatoes and fruit and everything because people don't know
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  that a blueberry has 57 disinfectants.
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  You must be having a giant effect.
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  Or it's other people having the same idea of the Holy Spirit because these big mega churches
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  in Austin are saying the same thing now.
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  I think God's spirit is warning people as Bill Gates tries to buy up all the farmland
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  and shut it down.
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  And as the USDA literally says they don't want to produce food anymore,
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  that the people are organically figuring this out.
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  Yes, sir.
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:33.000]  People realize we're coming to, I mean, some of my Hispanic congregation said,
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  Pastor, we went in.
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:35.000]  We tried to buy tomatoes.
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  We went into three stores and couldn't get them.
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  I said, don't worry, we'll have all the tomatoes.
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  Plus, I'm starting.
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  I've got a major seed bank that I'm working with people to have seed.
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  And I'm talking about heirloom seeds.
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  Some of our seeds go back 700 years.
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:53.000]  So this is very important because you don't want the genetically modified seeds.
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  You want the heirloom, the pure seed.
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  And it's the same way as what they're doing with people, creating hybrid people,
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  trying to put implants in their brains and do all kinds of stuff because they're trying
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  to mess up the seed that God created in the book of Genesis to produce off its own kind.
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  They're trying to produce off to some other kind.
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  And it's like revelation.
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  I mean, Romans, he says, even when they did not like to retain God in their knowledge,
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:23.000]  God gave them over to reprobate mind.
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  So I see them failing hopelessly.
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  This one unit on the side you can see is totally enclosed.
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  Now that's going to be for canning and freeze drying and to build up a food supply.
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  And I'm wanting to do this around local churches.
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  So I have a conference coming up here the end of May.
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  It's called unshakable because it's the word of God and the kingdom of God that is unshakable.
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  And this is very important, Alex.
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  And then I can show passes.
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:49.000]  This is how you grow.
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  We can show them the basic greenhouse kit with the basic seeds they need to put it in the way.
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  And by the way, Thomas Jefferson said we couldn't be a free nation if we weren't all farming at some level.
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  He said once men are taken off the land, they turn themselves over to evil.
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  Farming literally gets us closer to God, doesn't it?
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  No question.
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  I mean, people come out there, you know, there's kids in the university.
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  They don't know where food comes from.
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  And so now for the first time they can plant a seed and see the results of the seed growing.
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  So you're saying the future is going to be the humans rediscovering how God made us
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  and countering all the poison stuff they produce with real stuff
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  and people want the real stuff and will stop their GMO takeover.
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  It's beautiful.
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  Totally, totally.
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  So obviously we've got to preach the gospel, get people heart changed because if you have wicked people
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  what they'll do is build a huge farm and then sell it to Monsanto and sell it to Bill Gates.
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  So I mean, there's a lot of people bailing out on what they've had.
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  Well, I'll just take a paycheck now.
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  I'll sell it for a billion.
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  Don't sell what God has given you.
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:54.000]  This stuff needs to be controlled by the body of Christ and by the righteous.
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  The Bible says the righteous will flourish like a palm tree.
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  And I know there's many things happening.
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  And the Bible says there's wars and rumors of wars, famines, earthquakes, pestilences
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  and all of these things will continue until Jesus comes.
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  But we are the church and triumphant we shall stand.
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:17.000]  And so quickly put the clip up for the upcoming conference.
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  It's the 22nd of May through the 29th.
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  And I'm going to be showing people how to do all of this stuff because just roll it quickly, Alec.
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  Very, very exciting.
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  Here's a clip that they're running from their studio.
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:03.000]  In his name.
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  God's called you to do exploits.
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:09.000]  In his name.
[1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  There's people sitting here and you wondering how in the world am I going to accomplish what God's called me to do.
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  That which I feel the Lord's telling me to do is so big.
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  It's in meetings like this where the five gods falling.
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  Suddenly you see things you never saw before.
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  Suddenly you know things you didn't know before.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  Somebody said it's all over, pastor, things are finished.
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  I've got news for you, it's not over.
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  I saw the hand of God clear the earth one more time.
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  One more time.
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  One more time, he was saying.
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  One more time, nations will tremble and break.
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:41:07.000]  Fire.
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:09.000]  Very, very exciting.
[1:41:09.000 --> 1:41:11.000]  I'm glad you shared that with us.
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:13.000]  And the enemy knew to try to shut down the churches.
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:17.000]  They knew that God is the cure to the satanic cobra bite we're under, pastor.
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  No doubt.
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  And that's why you under attack because you're informing people and they don't like what you're doing.
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  But Alex, I don't believe that they, I know they failed.
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:29.000]  They failed for the season right now.
[1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  I know they're regrouping, but they will fail.
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:33.000]  The wicked will fail.
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  God is frustrating the plans of the wicked right now.
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  He's pulling the wheels.
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  I mean, I watched the Saturday night White House press, you know, the big comedy thing, which whatever.
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  Yeah, the press dinner where they made fun of people starving.
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  And I was laughing at them.
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  Realize how stupid they are.
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:42:01.000]  They don't even actually understand what's actually going on.
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  And they're all just falling for it.
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  Hookline and sinking.
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  Yeah, they are posting on the Instagram and whatever.
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  I was just wearing this by this designer and then they're posting.
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:13.000]  Can't believe we're sitting in a room full of people.
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  People are going to be infected.
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  And even President Biden, or I call him O Biden, this is Obama and Biden together.
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  And so I was just laughing at it.
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  I thought it was very funny that, you know, they making fools out of themselves every time they open their mouth.
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  It's not intelligence that speaking is people that are totally delusional.
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  And it doesn't matter what they say.
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  It's like God is really mocking.
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  You're right.
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  Come back and let's talk about that because they are trying to destroy us.
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  But in the process, they're really destroying themselves.
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  I'm going to ask Brown to stay there.
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:24.000]  I love the logo.
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:25.000]  When I first saw it, there was a big bull.

[1:45:09.160 --> 1:45:15.840]  terrorists. The days of independent media are numbered. The government has made it illegal

[1:45:21.120 --> 1:45:27.960]  us and make us go away quietly. With practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated
[1:45:27.960 --> 1:45:33.440]  up in camps, the traders know they can shut us down by force. But that would accelerate
[1:45:33.440 --> 1:45:40.480]  the awakening exponentially. So be it. Make them silence us by force. This is the final

[1:47:45.920 --> 1:47:50.880]  And I'm really excited to be here tonight with the only group of Americans with a lower
[1:47:50.880 --> 1:47:57.880]  prover ready than I have.
[1:47:57.880 --> 1:48:03.080]  Well, my goodness traces, let me tell you the news. My head's been wet with the midnight
[1:48:03.080 --> 1:48:11.080]  dew. I've been down on Bended Knee, talking to the man from Galilee. He spoke to me of
[1:48:11.080 --> 1:48:14.880]  the voice so sweet, I thought I heard the shuffle of things.
[1:48:14.880 --> 1:48:19.120]  Revival.com, all about amazing things. Pastor Rodney Howard Brown is doing, really should
[1:48:19.120 --> 1:48:22.800]  make it your online church. You live in Florida, you should go be part of it, or you should
[1:48:22.800 --> 1:48:27.160]  definitely come when he goes on these tours all around the world in the country. Revival.com.
[1:48:27.160 --> 1:48:30.440]  So I wanted to finish up there and then get into some other news, but you're right. They're
[1:48:30.440 --> 1:48:35.360]  making fools of themselves. Everything they do hurts us, but hurts them 10 times worse
[1:48:35.360 --> 1:48:39.720]  because they really are slaves of the world government devil system. And don't these
[1:48:39.720 --> 1:48:42.240]  evil ones know that or what's their problem?
[1:48:42.240 --> 1:48:49.400]  Well, I mean, yes, the president, he's stating that he's with a group of people that have
[1:48:49.400 --> 1:48:57.600]  a lower rating than he, they all know. They all know. I mean, what's it, Boris John, no,
[1:48:57.600 --> 1:49:02.560]  was it Macron can't go anywhere now, they've pelt him with eggs. And he says approval
[1:49:02.560 --> 1:49:09.680]  rating of like 36%, but he won with 58% of the vote. Really, really seriously, who's
[1:49:09.680 --> 1:49:14.840]  going to even believe that? So all of this stuff is total garbage. They know in their
[1:49:14.840 --> 1:49:20.120]  heart of hearts that they, they part of a scam that, but I don't know what they think
[1:49:20.120 --> 1:49:27.440]  that their reward is going to be great. Obviously Lucifer has promised them, I'm going to give
[1:49:27.440 --> 1:49:32.480]  you the kingdom of the earth, but they don't know that they're going to go to a lost eternity
[1:49:32.480 --> 1:49:38.680]  without Jesus. And they need to repent now of their sin and come to God and cry out,
[1:49:38.680 --> 1:49:43.360]  say, Lord, forgive me. I'm a sinner. I need you. I need your blood. Wash me clean and
[1:49:43.360 --> 1:49:47.840]  come to him. I mean, God will have mercy on all of them as much as we don't like them.
[1:49:47.840 --> 1:49:52.720]  God will have mercy on all of them because that's how he is. So, but they obviously
[1:49:52.720 --> 1:49:58.120]  think they are just, Hey, we fine, you know, and even Bill Gates, how does a Microsoft
[1:49:58.120 --> 1:50:05.000]  engineer suddenly now is a world health professional on viruses and pandemics and whatever. So
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:09.920]  it's all part of eugenics movement, as you know, and what they, what they're planning.
[1:50:09.920 --> 1:50:13.680]  But you've been on it for so many years. I just wish people who had listened to you
[1:50:13.680 --> 1:50:15.840]  20 plus years ago, Alex,
[1:50:15.840 --> 1:50:21.120]  Let me ask you that before we hit some other news. You always send me words of encouragement.
[1:50:21.120 --> 1:50:26.680]  I showed folks this earlier, but this is pretty incredible. This is in mainstream news. It's
[1:50:26.680 --> 1:50:31.520]  all over the place that the Justice Department, here it is. And I learned it this week and
[1:50:31.520 --> 1:50:34.120]  half ago, but the lawyers asked me not to talk about it at the time, but it's in the
[1:50:34.120 --> 1:50:36.720]  news. Now we can.
[1:50:36.720 --> 1:50:40.440]  Feds back Sandy Hook families. Again, I hardly ever talked about it, questioned it. A lot
[1:50:40.440 --> 1:50:44.440]  of people did. They make me the Sandy Hook guy. Now they were the first amendment. Feds
[1:50:44.440 --> 1:50:48.700]  back Sandy Hook families in legal fight with Alex Jones. What are the feds doing trying
[1:50:48.700 --> 1:50:52.880]  to get involved in a federal court where I'm doing a chapter 11 bankruptcy so that they
[1:50:52.880 --> 1:50:57.160]  can't misrepresent the state courts? That's totally legal, totally lawful. The hell is
[1:50:57.160 --> 1:51:04.600]  dirty and bad. And they had the head guy from the federal agency overall, this call up.
[1:51:04.600 --> 1:51:11.520]  The representative of the judges, the trustees and say you're not allowed to even be part
[1:51:11.520 --> 1:51:15.160]  of this. Alex Jones doesn't get access to the courts. They said, excuse me, what are
[1:51:15.160 --> 1:51:20.000]  you talking about? And they're getting a transcript out to actually bring this out. I mean, this
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:24.520]  is next level, but they're in the news saying they did this. They said it is the policy
[1:51:24.520 --> 1:51:29.360]  of the administration quote from the top. I mean, the just department know Biden that
[1:51:29.360 --> 1:51:36.160]  Alex Jones doesn't get any relief. I mean, the brazenness, the desperateness, the outrageousness
[1:51:36.160 --> 1:51:39.680]  of this and obviously it's going to it's already backfiring on him. What the hell's going on
[1:51:39.680 --> 1:51:45.880]  with these people, Pastor? Well, I mean, I think even Trevor Noah said something at
[1:51:45.880 --> 1:51:50.280]  the dinner, which you might want to pull that clip. He said, I think any son like Hunter
[1:51:50.280 --> 1:51:54.840]  Biden who makes money off of his father's position should be investigated. That was
[1:51:54.840 --> 1:52:01.360]  a zinger that that Trevor Noah dropped the other day. And you know, I'm I'm I like Trevor
[1:52:01.360 --> 1:52:06.400]  to come from South Africa. And before she came in, he got turned left. But he has started
[1:52:06.400 --> 1:52:11.320]  questioning everything from the back scenes to all of these stupid mandates. He started
[1:52:11.320 --> 1:52:16.320]  to question them. And I thought he he handled it. I thought it was funny. He could have
[1:52:16.320 --> 1:52:19.880]  dropped a few totally agreement. It's what you're saying. What does it mean when even
[1:52:19.880 --> 1:52:24.880]  their former minions are turning against them in front of their faces like Trevor Noah,
[1:52:24.880 --> 1:52:27.240]  like Bill Maher? What does that signify, Pastor Rodney Arbrone?
[1:52:27.240 --> 1:52:32.240]  Well, I think they're going to push everybody to their place. I think they're going to push
[1:52:32.240 --> 1:52:36.160]  people to their place where people are going to realize, look, I'm either going to come
[1:52:36.160 --> 1:52:43.040]  and be and be honest and truthful to my heart, or I'm going to live the lie. So this is really
[1:52:43.040 --> 1:52:47.640]  what's happening. And I think the things unfolding, I think the things being exposed. It's like
[1:52:47.640 --> 1:52:52.160]  the whole Russia, Ukraine nonsense that's going on. I think all of this stuff's going
[1:52:52.160 --> 1:52:56.760]  to be exposed for what it is. And we're going to see it happen. And I believe the Lord's
[1:52:56.760 --> 1:53:01.680]  on our side. That's why I tell the church, pray, pray every day that God wouldn't intervene.
[1:53:01.680 --> 1:53:06.560]  And and for those that, you know, don't go to church or whatever, talk to God. Somebody
[1:53:06.560 --> 1:53:10.640]  said, I don't believe there's a God. OK, if you don't believe me, there is one. Just say,
[1:53:10.640 --> 1:53:16.160]  if you're real, show yourself to me and see what happens. God is real. Whether you're
[1:53:16.160 --> 1:53:21.840]  like very explain that God is not like the devil forcing things on you. God is free will.
[1:53:21.840 --> 1:53:26.320]  Just reach out to God, folks, and you'll be blown away. Explain that to him.
[1:53:26.320 --> 1:53:30.840]  Yeah, you know, basically, I mean, wherever you travel in the world, you'll see people
[1:53:30.840 --> 1:53:38.320]  that they say to you, I knew that there was someone I didn't know who there was. Now,
[1:53:38.320 --> 1:53:43.760]  I have a story of a missionary who comes from Canada that was touring the Arctic Circle
[1:53:43.760 --> 1:53:52.800]  amongst the people that follow the caravan. And they, yeah, they all they all roving people.
[1:53:52.800 --> 1:53:57.200]  He found this place in the northern part of Russia, and it took him about 18 months to
[1:53:57.200 --> 1:54:02.680]  go to this village. The only way he could go there was to take a Russian tank. He had
[1:54:02.680 --> 1:54:08.200]  to hire it and went 46 hours across the tundra to get there. And when he got to the village,
[1:54:08.200 --> 1:54:11.840]  they said, what are you doing? And they never seen a white person. They said, what are you
[1:54:11.840 --> 1:54:16.800]  doing here? He said, I came to tell you about the God who's in heaven, who sent his son
[1:54:16.800 --> 1:54:22.080]  to die for you on the cross, and that he loves you. And the headman of the village said,
[1:54:22.080 --> 1:54:27.160]  why did you take so long? Why did you take so long? So they said, what do you mean take
[1:54:27.160 --> 1:54:30.880]  so long? It took us 18 months to get there. He said, we knew there was a God. And every
[1:54:30.880 --> 1:54:35.240]  night we talked amongst the village. So what we would go, we would stand and look up at
[1:54:35.240 --> 1:54:43.480]  the stars and we would shout, if you're out there, if you're out there, send somebody.
[1:54:43.480 --> 1:54:47.560]  And we've done that for the past number of years. What took you so long? So Alex, the
[1:54:47.560 --> 1:54:53.040]  people crying out, the people even in the cities of New York and Chicago and Los Angeles
[1:54:53.040 --> 1:54:58.100]  and even in Austin, Texas, Tampa, Florida, where I live, Miami, and all the great cities
[1:54:58.100 --> 1:55:03.360]  of America, Atlanta, they're crying out for God. The hound drugs, cocaine, every kind
[1:55:03.360 --> 1:55:09.000]  of synthetics, their life is caught in pornography and they could be in the middle of trying
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:15.200]  to identify with something that they know is not them. And they try to find that peace
[1:55:15.200 --> 1:55:21.400]  that only Jesus can give that that the whole gospel for God's beloved world that he gave
[1:55:21.400 --> 1:55:26.120]  his only begotten son, that whosoever believe it in him should not perish but have everlasting
[1:55:26.120 --> 1:55:31.440]  life for God did not send his son of the world to condemn the world. But he's but to
[1:55:31.440 --> 1:55:36.640]  save the world that all who would believe on him, look at these poor people, they're
[1:55:36.640 --> 1:55:45.000]  bound by drugs and alcohol. The only hope is not medical science and doctors and politicians.
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:50.280]  Only hope is Jesus. And the good thing is we seen people all across the city and every
[1:55:50.280 --> 1:55:56.120]  place we go that we're like that. Now they preach in the gospel, Alex, it's happening.
[1:55:56.120 --> 1:56:01.760]  God is doing it. And I see this is going to pick up momentum throughout the 2022 into
[1:56:01.760 --> 1:56:06.640]  2023 and 2024 that you're going to see the body of Christ stand and it's going to be
[1:56:06.640 --> 1:56:11.400]  I'm this denomination. I don't like him. I don't like that. You're going to see one
[1:56:11.400 --> 1:56:18.040]  church, not a globalist church, but one true church stand and draw line of the sand and
[1:56:18.040 --> 1:56:23.360]  believe the words of the Lord Jesus Christ himself and stand upon the word and we're
[1:56:23.360 --> 1:56:28.280]  going to see whole places shaken by the hand of God. And if God brought America through
[1:56:28.280 --> 1:56:35.360]  in 1776 and he carried America through the 1800s, then God will carry America through
[1:56:35.360 --> 1:56:40.960]  in 2022. And that's the way I see it. I'm totally if I didn't feel like that, I would
[1:56:40.960 --> 1:56:46.240]  tell everybody and I would, I don't know what I would do, but I pass around revival.com

[1:57:39.680 --> 1:57:51.760]  news today. We'll be right back. Stay with us. The UN estimates that over 2 billion people alive on Earth today have
[1:57:51.760 --> 1:57:57.720]  cognitive disabilities, lower IQs and so many other medical issues because of one thing, iodine
[1:57:57.720 --> 1:58:04.360]  deficiency. And most iodine that you get from different foods is bound to other minerals or other
[1:58:04.360 --> 1:58:10.080]  compounds. So it's not absorbable in the body. And that's why iodine deficiency is such a huge issue. We
[1:58:10.080 --> 1:58:15.240]  have the purest, cleanest, best iodine in the world from deep breath crystals, more than 7,000 feet

[2:00:04.000 --> 2:00:10.080]  going to happen to Obama and the new world order and their controllers and Bill Gates. But I speak
[2:00:10.080 --> 2:00:15.280]  from the heart when I think that God will give us a major sign against these people very, very
[2:00:15.280 --> 2:00:19.760]  similarly seeing it so many places so many ways. Here's a very important report from the great
[2:00:19.760 --> 2:00:23.840]  John Bown. Hello, it's the trendy demons. We'll be right back with tons of news. Stay with us.
[2:00:23.840 --> 2:00:34.480]  As moral society breaks down even further in the satanist when the upper echelons of society
[2:00:34.480 --> 2:00:40.800]  assume that their rituals are acceptable passes statements like these begin to trickle out. I
[2:00:40.800 --> 2:00:47.200]  guess to drink each other's might mislead people are like people are imagining us with like goblets
[2:00:47.200 --> 2:00:52.320]  and we're like game of thrones drinking each other's blood. It's just a few drops. But yes,
[2:00:52.320 --> 2:00:59.440]  we do consume each other's blood on occasion for ritual purposes only in a tell all interview with
[2:00:59.440 --> 2:01:06.080]  glamour magazine. Megan Fox addressed rumors admitting that she and machine gun Kelly routinely
[2:01:06.080 --> 2:01:12.640]  engage in blood drinking rituals. It is used for a reason and it is controlled where it's like
[2:01:12.640 --> 2:01:18.000]  let's shed a few drops of blood and each drink it he's much more haphazard and hectic and chaotic
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:22.880]  where he's willing to just like cut his chest open with broken glass and be like take my soul.
[2:01:23.760 --> 2:01:30.960]  Let me bleed on you. It doesn't not happen. Let me tell you maybe not exactly like that but it
[2:01:30.960 --> 2:01:38.720]  a version of that has happened and many times as Jamie White writes reactions from social media
[2:01:38.720 --> 2:01:44.800]  over Fox's disturbing revelations ranged from pointing out that Alex Jones was right about
[2:01:44.800 --> 2:01:52.000]  Hollywood satanic energy to mocking Fox and Kelly's sadomasochistic romance. Meanwhile a child
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:58.720]  formerly under the care of South African band the Antward known as Taki who is now 20 years old
[2:01:58.720 --> 2:02:04.400]  accused the duo of exposing him and his underage sibling to pornography and sexual activity,
[2:02:04.400 --> 2:02:10.640]  unspeakable violence and even rituals tinged with their own blood. When I lifted up the one box
[2:02:10.640 --> 2:02:18.480]  like the whole black magic voodoo like voodoo sh** came out like they felt they felt like a rabbit
[2:02:18.480 --> 2:02:26.640]  foot I think it was a wolf's foot or whatever felt out there there was like a voodoo doll
[2:02:27.440 --> 2:02:33.520]  there was a small bottle of blood. Did you and your sister ever had blood taken from you by
[2:02:33.520 --> 2:02:41.200]  an engineer Lundy? Yes lots of times actually they took us to like a place it's not really like a hospital
[2:02:41.200 --> 2:02:46.240]  or a private hospital some type of thing but it wasn't they took us there and they said like it's
[2:02:46.240 --> 2:02:52.480]  like a hospital but there was no cause and then Ninja took us in there it took our blood and then
[2:02:52.480 --> 2:02:57.200]  we all made Lundy and then we go out and then Ninja's the only one who stays in like inside a
[2:02:57.200 --> 2:03:03.040]  hospital like for 15 minutes or so and when it came out when it came out of there he had like a
[2:03:03.040 --> 2:03:08.480]  red bag in his hand and when it took out the things in the bag I saw a little bottle of blood
[2:03:08.480 --> 2:03:13.680]  inside the bag and my mother said it was gonna be a good like experience for me it's gonna be better
[2:03:13.680 --> 2:03:19.680]  for me and what that's how I went then I also thought it was good but then after a while I found out
[2:03:19.680 --> 2:03:24.640]  to say they were actually just grooming me and speaking of the Hollywood pastime of grooming
[2:03:24.640 --> 2:03:30.240]  read the book you'll be like transitioning from Disney into this was easy I don't know getting
[2:03:30.240 --> 2:03:36.800]  molested for from your six to your 14 seems like way harder circumstances are being physically
[2:03:36.800 --> 2:03:43.040]  abused all the time the type of mistreatment that I was still dealing with at that time that
[2:03:43.040 --> 2:03:49.200]  everyone around me saw and did nothing according to the Daily Mail a British actress who starred in
[2:03:49.200 --> 2:03:56.480]  Dr. Strange and her husband are accused of having sex with a 13 year old girl after they groomed her
[2:03:56.480 --> 2:04:02.880]  the girl now an adult says that Zara Pythian and Victor Mark film the abuse in a bid to
[2:04:02.880 --> 2:04:09.920]  recreate pornographic scenes the abuse is claimed to have happened between 2005 and 2008 when the
[2:04:09.920 --> 2:04:15.680]  couple were martial arts instructors in Nottinghamshire everything that we've seen already is just
[2:04:15.680 --> 2:04:21.760]  the beginning and our society is enabling this evil inhabiting the bodies and minds of those we
[2:04:21.760 --> 2:04:27.920]  clamor to theaters and music venues to pay our hard-earned money to see but it all adds up in
[2:04:27.920 --> 2:04:34.800]  the words of John Adams our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people it is wholly

[2:10:44.720 --> 2:10:51.600]  over it the world worth the world health organization is attempting a power grab number one most people
[2:10:51.600 --> 2:10:59.760]  have never heard the international health regulations i hr the nations agreed to the i hr in 2005
[2:11:00.320 --> 2:11:04.160]  pastor brown had that document from land security planning all of it then that he broke last hour
[2:11:05.360 --> 2:11:11.760]  number two that's a key tidbit isn't it on january 18 2022 the united nation submitted a number of
[2:11:11.760 --> 2:11:18.560]  amendments to the i hr that serve to give away even more of our sovereignty and greatly empower
[2:11:18.560 --> 2:11:24.000]  the world health organization or the who to restrict your health related rights and freedoms
[2:11:24.000 --> 2:11:30.240]  takes control of everything number three the 75th meeting of the world health assembly will be held
[2:11:30.240 --> 2:11:37.280]  in geneva switzerland from may 22 28 this year this month the assembly will vote on the amendments
[2:11:37.280 --> 2:11:44.080]  to the i hr they are very likely to pass and be enacted into international law unless we the people
[2:11:44.080 --> 2:11:48.640]  stand up against this attack on our sovereignty and even if they pass it we have to block it at
[2:11:48.640 --> 2:11:52.320]  the congressional level at the court level because biden will try to implement number four these
[2:11:52.320 --> 2:11:56.960]  amendments to the international health regulations do not need to be approved by two thirds of the
[2:11:56.960 --> 2:12:02.720]  u.s senate we have already agreed to obey the i hr and previous treaties by virtue of our membership
[2:12:02.720 --> 2:12:07.600]  in the united nations and the world health organization we have already given away some of our sovereignty
[2:12:07.600 --> 2:12:13.440]  these amendments are designed to confuse the member nations into giving away even more of
[2:12:13.440 --> 2:12:20.400]  their sovereignty number five in addition to the proposed amendments in the i hr the who has also
[2:12:20.400 --> 2:12:25.920]  set up an intergovernmental negotiating body that is actively negotiating an international treaty
[2:12:25.920 --> 2:12:32.080]  a pandemic prevention preparedness and response proposed pandemic treaty is separate from the
[2:12:32.080 --> 2:12:36.880]  addition to proposed amendments to the international health regulations mentioned above so they get you
[2:12:36.880 --> 2:12:41.200]  to sign on to it and they say well your government's already signed on unless the government says no
[2:12:41.200 --> 2:12:46.960]  number six the pandemic treaty does not yet exist it is being drafted and negotiated right now
[2:12:46.960 --> 2:12:51.280]  discussions regarding the pandemic treaty are important but they are also part of the sophisticated
[2:12:51.280 --> 2:12:57.120]  diversion to confuse people and get them to ignore the immediate concern which is the amendments to
[2:12:57.120 --> 2:13:03.680]  the i hr being considered by the world health organization this may 22 28 number seven the
[2:13:03.680 --> 2:13:09.680]  time to speak out and stand up for your rights is now all you saw in the last two years was a drill
[2:13:09.680 --> 2:13:17.680]  and a preparation for this hashtag don't you dare hashtag stop their i hr hashtag we are sovereign
[2:13:17.680 --> 2:13:22.400]  and the website don't you dare dot info excellent job i want to get the folks running this on
[2:13:22.400 --> 2:13:28.960]  this is a big big deal the censorship the control the forced inoculations

[2:16:58.800 --> 2:17:04.160]  we're barking up the wrong tree calling this gain of function research now if you read the actual
[2:17:04.160 --> 2:17:09.920]  you know 2014 legislation the u.s. government gain of function deliberative process and research
[2:17:09.920 --> 2:17:15.120]  funding pause on selected gain of function research involving influenza mers and stars
[2:17:15.120 --> 2:17:20.720]  viruses there's nothing about stars like viruses and it's a research funding pause it's not a stop
[2:17:20.720 --> 2:17:25.120]  it's not a prohibition it's when you come to a four-way intersection there's the stop sign you
[2:17:25.120 --> 2:17:30.240]  stop you look both ways and then you proceed and so it's also it doesn't pause all gain of function
[2:17:30.240 --> 2:17:35.040]  just selected gain of function but they'll argue that this is actually characterization and
[2:17:35.040 --> 2:17:39.520]  qualification research though you know rand and the others you know maybe fouchy was right they
[2:17:39.520 --> 2:17:43.040]  don't quite know what they're talking about calling it gain of function you know that's why he didn't
[2:17:43.040 --> 2:17:47.520]  perjure himself that's why he hasn't been arrested because they're literally creating new synthetic
[2:17:47.520 --> 2:17:52.720]  life forms that mimic what the viruses do but in the main definition it's still a gain of function
[2:17:52.720 --> 2:17:56.720]  you're making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people thank you mike we love you

[2:20:55.280 --> 2:21:00.720]  everybody's waking up we're doomed it's because they think they got us in a stranglehold
[2:21:00.720 --> 2:21:08.160]  it's the other way around they think they can just attack and imprison and kill our leaders
[2:21:09.520 --> 2:21:13.840]  that'll just make our people stronger that's why they've been taking those final steps
[2:21:13.840 --> 2:21:18.560]  of yours truly but i don't take anything for granted and i'm not arrogant and every day
[2:21:18.560 --> 2:21:25.200]  that i'm alive or not arrested i see that as a blessing every day we are able to warm millions
[2:21:25.200 --> 2:21:28.560]  of people and get you to warn others and get them to warn others tell them to warn others and the
[2:21:28.560 --> 2:21:35.920]  chain reaction is completed is children and innocence we're saving now i've talked a lot
[2:21:35.920 --> 2:21:41.120]  about this but i really want this to sink in and i want to sink into you and and i say that because
[2:21:41.120 --> 2:21:45.600]  living here in america most solicitors do even our poorest are better off than pretty much anybody
[2:21:45.600 --> 2:21:49.680]  in the world and america's got big problems till you travel around the world and it really is true
[2:21:49.680 --> 2:21:55.600]  wow this country is awesome for the average person i mean it would be super rich would switzerland
[2:21:55.600 --> 2:22:02.880]  probably be nicer yeah but i mean it's just for the average person you you can't beat it okay and
[2:22:04.560 --> 2:22:08.720]  when we talk about 40 plus million people the last 26 seven months the starved death
[2:22:08.720 --> 2:22:14.560]  because the lockdowns that's 40 plus million people and the un says almost 300 million are set to die
[2:22:14.560 --> 2:22:20.480]  in the next year they ordered that lockdown the imf and world bank control those countries they
[2:22:20.480 --> 2:22:27.600]  murdered those people so let it sink in that people that went along with the lockdowns and
[2:22:27.600 --> 2:22:34.240]  wore the mask and moralized to you through their useful idiotness contribute to this death now we're
[2:22:34.240 --> 2:22:40.400]  not going to hate them but we need to also get in their faces and rebuke them and let them know
[2:22:40.400 --> 2:22:48.560]  what they did and the best way to do it is however you're able to reach out to people whether it's
[2:22:48.560 --> 2:22:53.200]  a church or at work or on the street perfect strangers but with digital information here
[2:22:53.200 --> 2:22:59.040]  let me give you a card with the website on let me let me warn you talk to people and they get in
[2:22:59.040 --> 2:23:04.480]  your face and you know tell you should be quote vaccinated and explain them it's not a vaccine
[2:23:04.480 --> 2:23:09.760]  doesn't protect you don't let them push you around anymore everything they're doing is about
[2:23:09.760 --> 2:23:19.040]  silencing you because you have the power and if you don't use it i'm not in your face here
[2:23:19.040 --> 2:23:23.280]  i'm just telling you respectfully you don't need me to tell you this but i'm gonna tell you you
[2:23:23.280 --> 2:23:28.320]  know what i'm gonna say those of you that are fighting hard and spreading the word and doing
[2:23:28.320 --> 2:23:32.240]  what you can do i salute you and thank you but for the millions of people that tune through here
[2:23:32.240 --> 2:23:36.480]  to see what it's all about and then well that just sounds a little too much i don't want to believe
[2:23:36.480 --> 2:23:45.680]  that this is real it's on record it's now completely decloaked and it's in our face and so what are we
[2:23:45.680 --> 2:23:50.880]  going to do about that what are you going to do about that because that's a really serious question
[2:23:50.880 --> 2:23:57.200]  because what are the hawaiian islands well they're actually the tallest mountains in the world taller
[2:23:57.200 --> 2:24:08.800]  than the Himalayas by 10 000 feet they are 50 000 foot i think the biggest one is kona and 15 16 000
[2:24:08.800 --> 2:24:13.520]  foot of it sticking up out of the ocean but the rest of it's under the water now why am i talking
[2:24:13.520 --> 2:24:18.560]  about that well picture america and and and red cities and red states that aren't perfect but
[2:24:18.560 --> 2:24:23.200]  are better off everybody else the world as mountain tops and we're up here on the mountain
[2:24:23.200 --> 2:24:27.600]  and we look down at the rest of the world that's drowned in tyranny and death and and and just
[2:24:27.600 --> 2:24:34.800]  absolutely out of control behavior and we see the water rising and we don't want to understand
[2:24:34.800 --> 2:24:39.040]  that we're soon going to be underwater as well so the fate of all these latin americans and
[2:24:39.040 --> 2:24:45.440]  africans and people in the middle east and asia literally starving to death they just come and
[2:24:45.440 --> 2:24:49.440]  pick up the dead bodies you get malnourished you know you die of just a common cold
[2:24:49.440 --> 2:24:50.000]  common cold
[2:24:53.920 --> 2:25:01.760]  they are our responsibility and if we don't speak out against this we're going to flood too
[2:25:02.400 --> 2:25:05.680]  and the water's coming up so you got
[2:25:08.320 --> 2:25:15.120]  30 000 35 000 feet of water beneath the mountain and we're up here on the top and right where i live
[2:25:15.120 --> 2:25:22.560]  i can see the water creeping up the inflation the open borders the satanism the devaluation of the
[2:25:22.560 --> 2:25:29.680]  currency so we're here in america up on the surface but right over the edge is a cliff straight down
[2:25:29.680 --> 2:25:37.920]  to the bottom so it all looks pretty and nice up here where we're at and it looks even nicer to
[2:25:37.920 --> 2:25:43.200]  the globalist up there on their giant 100 000 200 000 acre ranches and their 5000 acre palatial
[2:25:43.200 --> 2:25:48.480]  facilities and just all of it their own little reservations away from us while they wage war on
[2:25:48.480 --> 2:25:54.880]  us and they need to know they'll be flooded as well as they get rid of new processes they get rid
[2:25:54.880 --> 2:25:59.040]  of freedom as they consolidate power out of pure greed they destroy the liberty and freedom and the
[2:25:59.040 --> 2:26:05.680]  engine that made them so wealthy that they've been scamming so here's a headline food shortages in
[2:26:05.680 --> 2:26:10.640]  six months the globalists are telling us what happens next big article by brandon smith of
[2:26:10.640 --> 2:26:17.280]  alt markets on enforce.com used to go read it and it just goes over the un saying that and it's true
[2:26:17.280 --> 2:26:24.960]  but then they're the ones doing it and then they pose as the saviors that is a big big big deal we
[2:26:24.960 --> 2:26:29.120]  need to read the clara writes and point out this is happening and point out this was all deliberate
[2:26:29.680 --> 2:26:33.680]  the population operation they don't just kill you with the cover they cooked up in a lab and then
[2:26:33.680 --> 2:26:41.600]  blocking the different treatments and things therapeutics they didn't just do it locking
[2:26:41.600 --> 2:26:45.600]  up the nursing homes and shipping covid patients in to kill them you can't come into the covid
[2:26:45.600 --> 2:26:51.200]  patient can that just murders common sense they're doing it through the starvation and then the
[2:26:51.200 --> 2:26:58.160]  economic collapse and then those that survived military aged men flood us and collapse the
[2:26:58.160 --> 2:27:04.160]  western world they're the big tidal waves coming in crashing into the side of the mountain so this
[2:27:04.160 --> 2:27:08.400]  is what's going on and god is pissed off about this ladies and gentlemen i'm going to give the
[2:27:08.400 --> 2:27:12.080]  number out we're going to come back and take your calls and hit the censorship news and the incredible
[2:27:12.080 --> 2:27:16.960]  ukraine news of door-to-door arrest of people that mildly criticize the corrupt regime and our
[2:27:16.960 --> 2:27:23.200]  government backing this north korean style or nazi style evil i guess nazis better because

[2:32:04.800 --> 2:32:09.520]  where the other patricks can get on the line uh alex i have to promote one thing from one of
[2:32:09.520 --> 2:32:15.600]  your co-host owen schreuer supermail volatility and brain force plus mix those two together
[2:32:15.600 --> 2:32:20.960]  you're an unstoppable tank supermail volatility really really works it's cold pressed herbs
[2:32:20.960 --> 2:32:27.440]  and natural compounds that have never been heated up and so it has a dramatic effect compared to
[2:32:27.440 --> 2:32:32.080]  powdered versions that also work quite well but just aren't as strong this is like a very fine
[2:32:32.080 --> 2:32:36.640]  wine it's it's it's in fact each batch is different sometimes it's super strong sometimes it's just
[2:32:36.640 --> 2:32:40.320]  okay people like why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong
[2:32:40.320 --> 2:32:45.840]  that's just how it is it's how it works uh so it's always good it's just sometimes it's like
[2:32:45.840 --> 2:32:54.560]  super strong but yeah if you want the rolls royce at a decent price then this is it
[2:32:58.480 --> 2:33:04.480]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:33:06.800 --> 2:33:12.880]  so i would say you know if anything that's happening at cnn and anybody who buys your
[2:33:12.880 --> 2:33:18.800]  book it's really just one of those things that is dividing our nation and i don't believe in
[2:33:18.800 --> 2:33:25.200]  dividing our nation it hurts our great nation and so cnn is really the enemy of the truth
[2:33:25.200 --> 2:33:43.680]  and that's my opinion thank you no american is an enemy of another american no news outlet is an enemy of america
[2:33:44.240 --> 2:33:49.280]  no news outlet is an enemy of america no news outlet is an enemy of america
[2:33:49.280 --> 2:33:53.760]  no news outlet is an enemy of america no news outlet is an enemy of america
[2:33:53.760 --> 2:34:20.240]  it came in peace
[2:34:24.560 --> 2:34:29.600]  no news outlet is an enemy of america bill gates loves you take them and see
[2:34:36.640 --> 2:34:38.240]  this is cnn
[2:34:45.280 --> 2:34:49.520]  all right my friends we are back we're take calls from kevin david michael mike
[2:34:49.520 --> 2:34:56.800]  cameron rudy barrett and others let me just briefly tell you this elon muskis going to
[2:34:56.800 --> 2:35:01.280]  town he just keeps getting better and better i'm not saying i totally trust him or he's our messiah
[2:35:01.280 --> 2:35:07.920]  i'm just saying he's bringing up jeffrey eppstein gisling maxwell the client list bill gates
[2:35:09.360 --> 2:35:14.160]  and the factor needs to be an ending to the cover-up of that by the justice department
[2:35:14.160 --> 2:35:18.400]  that's the stuff of victory right there that's what we need to be hearing and if you do stuff
[2:35:18.400 --> 2:35:23.600]  like that you're on the right team he is really taking him on and if you look at the trajectory
[2:35:23.600 --> 2:35:30.400]  of how hardcore he's getting uh it is amazing i mean if he keeps doing this week after week
[2:35:30.960 --> 2:35:35.200]  i just don't know what we're gonna have to say about elon musk but wow uh and you know they could
[2:35:35.200 --> 2:35:42.160]  point out well he took a picture of her at a gala that's what these people do so he's saying that
[2:35:42.160 --> 2:35:47.280]  they photo bombed it bandy fair party and she photo bombed the background but you know that
[2:35:47.280 --> 2:35:52.640]  already don't you yeah that's what they do they creep up and they get in a photo with you and then
[2:35:52.640 --> 2:35:58.960]  they sit there somebody takes a picture and says that you're with her absolutely ridiculous yeah
[2:35:58.960 --> 2:36:05.360]  let's start with you he's now a client of gisling maxwell and jeffrey eppstein absolutely crazy and
[2:36:05.360 --> 2:36:11.040]  the more they mess with elon musk the more hardcore he gets okay let's do this i'm gonna get to the
[2:36:11.040 --> 2:36:15.040]  more of this censorship news after i get to your calls it's really insane it's waking a lot of people
[2:36:15.040 --> 2:36:19.520]  up with this ministry of truth but when you see the tyranny ukraine they admit that the obama
[2:36:19.520 --> 2:36:24.480]  administration is running now and again it is the obama administration uh he is now the dictator
[2:36:24.480 --> 2:36:30.400]  the third term of obama as a dictator trying to sew up their dictatorship and finish our transition
[2:36:30.400 --> 2:36:35.360]  into being of the new venezuela of the north the good news is he tried to overthrow when he was
[2:36:35.360 --> 2:36:41.600]  president the in his second term uh the kenyan government and those emails and documents came
[2:36:41.600 --> 2:36:48.480]  out with muslims it failed uh and so they're not gonna get everything they want if we start saying
[2:36:48.480 --> 2:36:53.200]  no i mean it's very very clear all you can do is start saying no in warning people all right who's
[2:36:53.200 --> 2:37:02.080]  been holding the longest year i guess that would be michael in mississippi let's talk about satanism
[2:37:02.080 --> 2:37:12.880]  in hollywood welcome okay he just dropped off okay let's go to uh mike in south carolina
[2:37:12.880 --> 2:37:19.920]  mike in south carolina you're on the air yes sir alex could you hear me i can go ahead um first
[2:37:19.920 --> 2:37:26.560]  of all thank you for taking my call and i want to plug some of the products you have first if you
[2:37:26.560 --> 2:37:35.280]  don't mind sure go ahead um i use the magnesium i think that's fantastic the x2 is off the charts
[2:37:36.080 --> 2:37:42.400]  and i also want to mention the attire um i don't consider your t-shirts to be t-shirts or
[2:37:42.400 --> 2:37:48.720]  whatever you have i consider them to be uniforms and that's just my feeling about it well that's
[2:37:48.720 --> 2:37:53.520]  it i mean the left and their black antifa stuff is their uniform an info or shirt tells folks who
[2:37:53.520 --> 2:38:00.320]  you're with and it really does a lot of good yeah i get a lot of compliments on them trust me now i've
[2:38:00.320 --> 2:38:04.880]  got two things i want to run by you here and i can do it in three minutes or less but i think would
[2:38:04.880 --> 2:38:14.960]  be a great help and and a lot of this isolation with censorship if you'll allow me sure okay two
[2:38:14.960 --> 2:38:20.560]  things i know people they they say they're going to reach out to their representatives and try to
[2:38:20.560 --> 2:38:26.640]  make something happen and they can't get their voices heard people need to use those black
[2:38:26.640 --> 2:38:31.680]  things they carry around with them or whatever color their phones are make personal videos of
[2:38:32.400 --> 2:38:38.000]  of grievance or whatever you want to call it upload them to a safe website they can do that
[2:38:38.000 --> 2:38:43.440]  to rumble or bitch you to whatever then call the representatives nine times out of ten what's
[2:38:43.440 --> 2:38:48.320]  going to happen you're going to wind up getting a hold of who the people that are in his office
[2:38:48.320 --> 2:38:53.040]  you tell them your grievances or where you think they're dropping the ball and then you turn around
[2:38:53.040 --> 2:38:59.040]  before the call is and you say hey look just want to make you aware that i've made a video of this
[2:38:59.040 --> 2:39:05.840]  and sent it to your your email address to your rep my representative and i'm also sharing this
[2:39:05.840 --> 2:39:12.400]  with the world that's the first thing the absolute and don't just hit the friendly sites
[2:39:12.400 --> 2:39:16.960]  like gather everybody else they're awesome upload to youtube and twitter make them take it down the
[2:39:16.960 --> 2:39:20.880]  point is you never know what's going to go viral if everybody just starts being a leader it's game
[2:39:20.880 --> 2:39:25.680]  over for the globalist and go to city council and school board meetings that scares the hell
[2:39:25.680 --> 2:39:30.960]  out of us taking our governments back absolutely brother yes sir i've last thing i'll make this
[2:39:30.960 --> 2:39:37.200]  quick now we're isolated people don't i don't think they grasp censorship a lot of people think
[2:39:37.760 --> 2:39:43.440]  well okay censorship is you're putting videos up on youtube a lot not just getting pulled down it's
[2:39:43.440 --> 2:39:49.840]  more than that it's isolation i've got a suggestion that i'm hoping that you guys will take this and
[2:39:49.840 --> 2:39:56.320]  run with it all platforms what you're doing need to do the same here there has to be people out there
[2:39:56.320 --> 2:40:02.720]  that write code that build stuff for the platforms that build websites and whatnot these people
[2:40:02.720 --> 2:40:08.000]  need to build what i would call an online phone book an open source phone book that could work
[2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:15.200]  state by state town by town just something simple that could be open source to be given away to
[2:40:15.200 --> 2:40:21.920]  people like myself who run websites or have access to a place to park something like this
[2:40:22.480 --> 2:40:29.520]  where people can go and they can look and see okay well these people are in my state or whatnot
[2:40:29.520 --> 2:40:34.400]  so that people can form chapters and groups and you can also call that's right i mean whatever
[2:40:34.400 --> 2:40:38.640]  happened to meet up dot com i mean because that's the type i guess everybody got censored off that
[2:40:38.640 --> 2:40:44.400]  or what happened i don't know i'm not i'm not you're right that's the first thing republicans
[2:40:44.400 --> 2:40:47.760]  should be building but of course they aren't they're letting the democrats redistrict places like

[2:42:56.400 --> 2:43:02.320]  the un estimates that over two billion people alive on earth today have cognitive disabilities
[2:43:02.320 --> 2:43:08.640]  lower IQs and so many other medical issues because of one thing iodine deficiency and most iodine
[2:43:08.640 --> 2:43:14.640]  that you get from different foods is bound to other minerals or other compounds so it's not
[2:43:14.640 --> 2:43:19.680]  absorbable in the body and that's why iodine deficiency such a huge issue we have the purest
[2:43:19.680 --> 2:43:24.400]  cleanest best iodine in the world from deep breath crystals more than seven thousand feet deep
[2:43:25.040 --> 2:43:29.440]  x2 is an amazing product and it has been sold out for months and months and months it is now back

[2:44:07.040 --> 2:44:12.720]  because we're weak but because we're made the image of god the creator and we are powerful
[2:44:12.720 --> 2:44:18.240]  and the social engineers fear that so much so that's why i repeat that famous internet saying

[2:48:36.640 --> 2:48:41.040]  i'm i'm fight i'm in the fight of my life i've actually never been happier even those things
[2:48:41.040 --> 2:48:45.200]  are scary i'm right where god wants me to be brother so i'm actually recharged and empowered
[2:48:45.200 --> 2:48:51.200]  by the grace of christ yeah well i'm i'm praying for you so i can feel it i can feel it i want to
[2:48:51.200 --> 2:48:56.800]  thank you go ahead i want to talk about the four horsemen in the apocalypse um you were talking
[2:48:56.800 --> 2:49:03.440]  with pastor brown about signs and everybody's talking about um the mark of the beast but no
[2:49:03.440 --> 2:49:09.520]  one's talking about the four horsemen uh the first one obviously has been referred to as pestilence
[2:49:09.520 --> 2:49:15.360]  and the rider was given a crown or a corona and the second one obviously is war and then we're
[2:49:15.360 --> 2:49:23.520]  looking at the third one more obviously famine that's right in the latin they say that pestilence
[2:49:23.520 --> 2:49:30.000]  is given a crown of the of the corona and i guess that's latin or also spanish and it just describes
[2:49:30.000 --> 2:49:38.640]  it all perfectly doesn't it sure does and uh it's actually the beast that calls or the four beast
[2:49:38.640 --> 2:49:45.440]  that call forth the horsemen um and so i just think that that's very relevant for people that
[2:49:45.440 --> 2:49:51.520]  read the bible to look at that as the sign and so everybody should get their ducks in their
[2:49:51.520 --> 2:49:57.280]  in a row and uh get right with god well there's no doubt that any christ tries the same thing over
[2:49:57.280 --> 2:50:01.520]  and over again there'll be waves of beta testing till it comes but this is definitely either the
[2:50:01.520 --> 2:50:07.040]  real deal and the and the and the final big one coming up or it's them beta testing for the plan
[2:50:07.040 --> 2:50:12.320]  they're building out of the future but they do intend to kill 80 90 percent of us uh and that's
[2:50:12.320 --> 2:50:18.800]  more than what the bible says the bible will kill a what uh one fourth world's population so before
[2:50:18.800 --> 2:50:24.240]  it's turned around but they are definitely trying it's are great points anything else uh i wanted
[2:50:24.240 --> 2:50:30.560]  to talk about intelligence networks in ukraine and how uh the us aid which is a cover for the cia
[2:50:30.560 --> 2:50:38.960]  is um building network or has been building networks in ukraine since 2007 uh and even
[2:50:38.960 --> 2:50:47.120]  more so since 2014 uh you know along with the nato allies and trying to undermine any influence
[2:50:47.120 --> 2:50:51.840]  russia has in ukraine and by the way they admit that so the pentagon cia are in charge of rounding
[2:50:51.840 --> 2:50:58.000]  up tens of thousands for even posting anything vaguely critical of the dictator zelensky that's
[2:50:58.000 --> 2:51:03.040]  what he's become uh just unbelievable behavior and the associate press thinks it's wonderful
[2:51:04.400 --> 2:51:09.520]  and all the billions of dollars going into there is where is that all that money going
[2:51:09.520 --> 2:51:14.000]  we're talking about billions of dollars a lot of it goes back a lot of it goes back into the big
[2:51:14.000 --> 2:51:20.000]  guys hands no absolutely the big band yep joe biden great points sir god bless you more amazing
[2:51:20.000 --> 2:51:27.280]  calls coming up alex in texas alex welcome yes sir alex hi welcome
[2:51:31.200 --> 2:51:35.760]  your phone having a problem there alex go ahead can you hear me now not sure dude
[2:51:36.880 --> 2:51:41.440]  all right i'm sorry about that that's all right go ahead um thank you for the opportunity to talk
[2:51:41.440 --> 2:51:47.520]  i just want to start off by uh thanking god for you because between 2008 and 2009
[2:51:47.520 --> 2:51:52.880]  i was actually a youth leader in the communist party and i remember sitting there watching youtube
[2:51:52.880 --> 2:51:56.880]  back when you were actually being able to be on youtube and watch some content that was actually
[2:51:56.880 --> 2:52:03.360]  truthful and i watched 20 videos and i remember it changed my entire viewpoint on everything
[2:52:03.360 --> 2:52:10.480]  because at that point i knew something was wrong with the world but i thought that was
[2:52:10.480 --> 2:52:15.280]  belling against the system rebelling against all the evil in the world and at that time
[2:52:15.280 --> 2:52:20.400]  we're just coming out of a bush and so i want to be as far left as i could get
[2:52:21.280 --> 2:52:28.640]  so when i finally paid my dues and over the year or so that i was part of it you know there'd be
[2:52:28.640 --> 2:52:33.760]  phone conferences with the main base back in chicago and i realized at this point you know the
[2:52:33.760 --> 2:52:38.720]  communist party really is just kind of an underling of the world order but it's amazing how deeply
[2:52:38.720 --> 2:52:44.560]  entrenched they've been since the 50s and 60s now in the american institutions and the school system
[2:52:44.560 --> 2:52:53.200]  and in the government because they've set up the system now where they want to through the education
[2:52:53.200 --> 2:53:00.000]  system have a new sexual revolution that was always one of their key points that would be a big deal
[2:53:00.000 --> 2:53:06.080]  but in their mind they want this materialistic world where there is no god so how best to do
[2:53:06.080 --> 2:53:14.080]  that than to bring that materialistic doctrine into schools teach that god isn't real it's just
[2:53:14.080 --> 2:53:20.560]  more of a theory and that if you can get these kids separated from god without any thought of
[2:53:20.560 --> 2:53:25.920]  repentance or jesus christ it'll be that much easier for the state to take over and become the god
[2:53:26.560 --> 2:53:33.040]  and it's not as prevalent down south but up north where i'm raised you know evolution
[2:53:33.040 --> 2:53:39.360]  Darwinism social Darwinism is actually um you know it's a common practice that's right the
[2:53:39.360 --> 2:53:44.480]  communists are promised positions of power but really they're just useful idiots here's a headline
[2:53:44.480 --> 2:53:50.720]  on a red state communism has been tried and the reason it fails is simple no it hasn't failed
[2:53:50.720 --> 2:53:55.920]  it is an instrument of the big mega banks to destroy free markets and enslave people
[2:53:55.920 --> 2:54:01.440]  and then tell them that it's freedom communism has been a disastrous totally wicked success
[2:54:01.440 --> 2:54:05.920]  of the evil illuminati going back to the fringe revolution that was the beta test of it and that's
[2:54:05.920 --> 2:54:12.320]  even in mainline phd level political science they all know that and they are the parasitic ruling
[2:54:12.320 --> 2:54:17.440]  class i think we're all dumb animals and they plan to put us to death in slow labor death camps
[2:54:17.440 --> 2:54:21.600]  and that's who they are and if you got in i'm sure they started telling about the plan for blood
[2:54:21.600 --> 2:54:24.800]  and the plan to kill people in the red terror they were going to have and how they were going to
[2:54:24.800 --> 2:54:28.880]  collapse civilization through cloward and piven uh to then bring in the new order is that what you
[2:54:28.880 --> 2:54:34.560]  heard absolutely and the thing is you brought it up before they want a new french revolution
[2:54:34.560 --> 2:54:38.560]  so what they can try and do is just infiltrate all the other liberty movements and things like
[2:54:38.560 --> 2:54:43.440]  that which they have done because you've seen it in the libertarian movement what they have fingers
[2:54:43.440 --> 2:54:47.280]  in every pie well alex i'd like to give your number and maybe have you on via skype or something
[2:54:47.280 --> 2:54:51.840]  as a guest you can send us if you want any photo shots of you you know in the communist party
[2:54:51.840 --> 2:54:55.120]  or you would you protect your identity but i would love to have you on put them on hold and see
[2:54:55.120 --> 2:54:59.680]  who wants to come on as a guest thank you so much amazing call all right let's take another one here
[2:54:59.680 --> 2:55:06.480]  let's talk to a caller in florida let's talk to kevin in florida welcome kevin hey alex good to have
[2:55:06.480 --> 2:55:12.160]  you first long time first time love the show thanks for everything that you do um i've got the x2 i
[2:55:12.160 --> 2:55:19.200]  love d3 uh winter sun the alpha power ultra b12 the bodies is a miracle after a long bike ride
[2:55:19.200 --> 2:55:24.080]  you really do have the best products at the best prices thanks the one thing i really love is the
[2:55:24.080 --> 2:55:29.040]  privacy pocket i'm not sure if you're aware but florida is one of the few states that allows uh
[2:55:29.040 --> 2:55:34.800]  drt boxes or stingrays basically that's right the the the and dissonant should stop that but yeah the
[2:55:34.800 --> 2:55:39.920]  police the state police and others are scooping up your data and they actually have small aircraft
[2:55:39.920 --> 2:55:45.360]  like sessas and stuff with the dirt boxes on them flying directly overhead sometimes at 500 feet
[2:55:45.920 --> 2:55:50.800]  so giving them the double tall man and having the privacy pocket it's wonderful and it's not that
[2:55:50.800 --> 2:55:54.800]  we're bad it's that the government hackers out of control groups all that data scooped up and
[2:55:54.800 --> 2:55:59.520]  used against you later they can also spoof you and they can drive around copying your sim card
[2:55:59.520 --> 2:56:04.320]  digitally and make it look like you did something bad absolutely the one thing i wanted to talk about
[2:56:04.320 --> 2:56:09.680]  is um it seems like a maybe a couple months ago you switched to a new video player i can't change
[2:56:09.680 --> 2:56:15.120]  my resolution down usually you're in my pocket so i don't even really care if i'm at hd or anything
[2:56:15.120 --> 2:56:20.480]  but one thing that might help with your bandwidth costs monthly is maybe just uploading only like
[2:56:20.480 --> 2:56:25.520]  a maximum of 480 you're right and also on our great it crews we had a build made a video from
[2:56:25.520 --> 2:56:29.520]  scratch and all the systems at m4's and pay for the bandwidth is to create a little audio button
[2:56:29.520 --> 2:56:34.400]  that says just listen in audio that's right there beside all the videos most people i mean most
[2:56:34.400 --> 2:56:38.160]  i don't want to look at myself i'll listen to rebroadcast i can't be driving watching no one
[2:56:38.160 --> 2:56:43.440]  or harrison or the other host so i mean i so to it you're great i've told them this a while back
[2:56:43.440 --> 2:56:48.480]  it didn't happen he's having we should we should put an audio player beside each video on the site
[2:56:48.480 --> 2:56:52.240]  or or at least the info wars video so it becomes a hassle and other people upload it if we're
[2:56:52.240 --> 2:56:56.240]  too encoded and do audio that probably we haven't done it we should probably make the audio player
[2:56:56.240 --> 2:57:01.680]  at info wars dot com on the live show feed at the top more more prevalent so folks can listen
[2:57:01.680 --> 2:57:06.800]  that way thank you so much sir all right we're gonna break we're gonna come back we're gonna

[3:00:23.680 --> 3:00:28.560]  and when none of us are poisoned and i appreciate that very much my brother um i've been a listener
[3:00:28.560 --> 3:00:34.080]  of yours uh for about 25 years bootleg tape from a cop buddy of mine back in the 90s when i was a cop
[3:00:34.960 --> 3:00:40.320]  on the branch and the work that you did at waco is incredible i have some ideas for you guys as
[3:00:40.320 --> 3:00:46.000]  for fundraiser i'm an idea and a big guy and a business man and uh have you ever considered maybe
[3:00:46.000 --> 3:00:49.200]  i mean of course you don't have to have you're gonna have to have co honies to do this as a
[3:00:49.200 --> 3:00:55.440]  business owner but i mean i do i don't care and i'm a christian uh why couldn't we have a fundraiser
[3:00:55.440 --> 3:01:03.760]  on your show where you do like a 15 or 30 second spot with patriot businesses that you could advertise
[3:01:04.400 --> 3:01:07.840]  and we could put it on maybe you could have the number flash on the screen or something briefly
[3:01:07.840 --> 3:01:12.800]  or something like that you could charge like a hundred dollars for it for like a 15 second spot
[3:01:13.840 --> 3:01:18.800]  and then all these people would uh would go to those businesses because i mean voting with
[3:01:18.800 --> 3:01:23.760]  our wallet is probably the second most powerful thing that we could do i totally agree with you
[3:01:23.760 --> 3:01:27.760]  or you know we could the thing would be organizing the advertisers having them reach out then getting
[3:01:27.760 --> 3:01:33.680]  that organized and prepare but it's a really smart idea or maybe even you know interview every hour
[3:01:33.680 --> 3:01:38.400]  for like five minutes the businesses and then and then you're having to do a little bit bigger
[3:01:38.400 --> 3:01:43.040]  sponsorship to make sure people reach out and got their services you know hey this is a great service
[3:01:43.040 --> 3:01:48.880]  people can use everywhere especially online companies you know things that's auto parts supply
[3:01:48.880 --> 3:01:54.720]  farming supply a book supply just all sorts of service type deals absolutely you know trying
[3:01:54.720 --> 3:01:58.320]  to make ends meet we've gone back to getting sponsors we found some great ones that help
[3:01:58.320 --> 3:02:02.400]  keep the payroll going and then we have these two big donations i gotta figure out how to cash them
[3:02:02.400 --> 3:02:06.480]  out at the right time but right now it's like two million dollars in bitcoin which took us into the
[3:02:06.480 --> 3:02:11.760]  black i said we're about two two point five million behind you know projecting out into the year
[3:02:11.760 --> 3:02:15.280]  needing to buy product to fund ourselves and now that just came through so i've got to be a good
[3:02:15.280 --> 3:02:19.120]  steward of that i'm trying to figure out the right answer with that but absolutely serve beautiful

[3:04:12.560 --> 3:04:16.800]  the right people uh because we kind of got rid of our advertising staff 10 years ago because of
[3:04:16.800 --> 3:04:21.360]  issues and things and i really want to vet the sponsors too and then and it's just it's just
[3:04:21.360 --> 3:04:25.280]  turn you know we're not a big corporate operation and now we have to pay for our own bandwidth uh

[3:04:28.880 --> 3:04:33.200]  there's things we can do to push more people to audio uh you know set a video and that's
[3:04:33.200 --> 3:04:36.400]  something we're having to look at if we don't get the funds but you know i just look at every

[3:06:18.960 --> 3:06:24.880]  to all the calls let's talk to cameron in texas then bear it in texas cameron welcome hey i'm
[3:06:24.880 --> 3:06:31.120]  alex hey man hey uh i want to make this uh short and quick but uh so uh i was hearing you talk
[3:06:31.120 --> 3:06:38.160]  about bitcoin and nfts and uh the attack on the free market and uh i think i have uh single-handedly
[3:06:38.160 --> 3:06:44.960]  a conceptual solution to uh negating that whole attack with uh like a concept that works like
[3:06:44.960 --> 3:06:53.440]  this um so nfts can be minted from nothing and so i was thinking this said uh they printed
[3:06:53.440 --> 3:06:59.200]  trillion or they printed trillions of dollars and uh i i was thinking maybe you know if there were a
[3:06:59.200 --> 3:07:05.840]  bunch of small businesses that would sell their products issue receipt and then uh hand out a
[3:07:05.840 --> 3:07:12.240]  business card were on the back of the business card there was a bill of sale uh uh field where
[3:07:12.240 --> 3:07:17.840]  two individual parties could sign uh handwrite their signatures and in terms and conditions on
[3:07:17.840 --> 3:07:22.720]  this bill of sale which is a business card that was issued to them after the business had sold them
[3:07:22.720 --> 3:07:28.880]  a good and it's qr code authenticated by the business and they're compliant with the s and
[3:07:28.880 --> 3:07:36.480]  s and p 500 their tax compliant and so what happens is this uh after two two private parties
[3:07:37.120 --> 3:07:44.000]  uh transacting in the free market uh they both take a photo of this bill of sale contract between
[3:07:44.000 --> 3:07:49.280]  both of them that are both they're both hand signed with their signature which is hard to replicate
[3:07:49.280 --> 3:07:55.120]  and so they upload it to a network uh both within the they both take photos of the same
[3:07:55.120 --> 3:08:01.520]  piece of paper uploaded to a network and then the network recognizes that it was uploaded
[3:08:01.520 --> 3:08:07.680]  within 15 seconds of each other timestamp verifies it and then generates an nft and that's on the
[3:08:07.680 --> 3:08:14.080]  network and it's like a decentralized network and then after supporting other fellow patriots you
[3:08:14.080 --> 3:08:19.600]  create a piece of art uh that then could have potential value into the future and it's a new
[3:08:19.600 --> 3:08:24.000]  really digital currency being used between the people using nfts is that which gives those acts
[3:08:24.000 --> 3:08:30.320]  feel out of value and then and then they take they yes exactly because they tear it in half
[3:08:30.320 --> 3:08:34.640]  that they tear the uh the business card in half after they do it and keep that as collateral
[3:08:34.640 --> 3:08:40.320]  in their pocket and that's like a we the people issued reserve note that then you can it's material
[3:08:40.320 --> 3:08:45.120]  and that's amazing we gotta make about it more write up a proposal mail it to me god bless your
[3:08:45.120 --> 3:08:49.200]  email and thank you sir barrett in florida last caller the journal salante takes over
[3:08:50.960 --> 3:08:56.080]  hey alex how you doing i'm good brother thank you for calling today hey man i was watching that
[3:08:56.080 --> 3:09:01.680]  pastor you had on earlier and he inspired me to call i'm a recent just started watching you
[3:09:01.680 --> 3:09:07.920]  like past three months and i've really gone to christ i went i got baptized amen because of of the
[3:09:07.920 --> 3:09:14.640]  stuff you've been pushing and but i got to ask you to to pray for all these sheeple as they
[3:09:14.640 --> 3:09:18.880]  they turn over because it's a dark hour when they come to the information that you print
[3:09:19.600 --> 3:09:23.440]  and and it takes a lot of courage to make it through that information and come out on the
[3:09:23.440 --> 3:09:28.000]  bright side now i hear you they say ignorance is bliss but it's also super dangerous and you're
[3:09:28.000 --> 3:09:32.400]  right i was once ignorant and it's really scary when you finally realize there's a bunch of psychotic
[3:09:32.400 --> 3:09:37.120]  predators taking over and that while we've been asleep they've been really building a giant digital
[3:09:37.120 --> 3:09:41.520]  gulag for all of us but at least we now know the truth brother i'm sorry the truth is he's pretty
[3:09:41.520 --> 3:09:49.600]  scary it is but i you know that's that that's what jesus is here he came not to condemn us but but to
[3:09:49.600 --> 3:09:55.520]  save us and another thing that's been on my heart since i've been watching you is i don't think you've
[3:09:55.520 --> 3:10:02.480]  been on trump enough about him pushing that vaccine still to this day and we know we know the
[3:10:02.480 --> 3:10:07.840]  trouble it's brought and what it's still bringing for months to come and now i hear you i'm very
[3:10:07.840 --> 3:10:13.120]  upset about trump uh but you know it's the point is is that he's not in power right now and he's
[3:10:13.120 --> 3:10:17.600]  very stubborn about the shot and doesn't want to admit he's wrong and it's just he's destroying
[3:10:17.600 --> 3:10:22.800]  himself i mean he's shut up about it mostly but he still runs his mouth about it and it's just
[3:10:22.800 --> 3:10:26.880]  it's ridiculous how he helped put through warp speed and all of it and now does understand
[3:10:26.880 --> 3:10:32.400]  it's a milson around his neck thank you so much but there's a new video on info wars dot com fda
[3:10:32.400 --> 3:10:36.800]  skipped stage three trials it's illegal it's a very important video you should share it all right

[3:20:58.160 --> 3:21:05.680]  to these bars these gold bars gold is the best i don't give financial advice i do trend forecasting
[3:21:05.680 --> 3:21:15.200]  for me my first buy of gold was 187 15 ounce and and you you know gold is the ultimate safe haven
[3:21:15.200 --> 3:21:21.440]  asset and when all things go down and this thing's going to go down like we've never seen in our

[3:36:19.680 --> 3:36:26.160]  serious very serious the markets the volatility today is ridiculous opened up went way down now
[3:36:26.160 --> 3:36:31.680]  it's up and now it's flattened the whole and there's a thing called a plunge protection team
[3:36:31.680 --> 3:36:36.640]  it's not a plunge protection team it's a rigged game by the fed where when the markets go down
[3:36:36.640 --> 3:36:42.800]  they dump a lot of dough in it artificially prop them back up we are going to go into this most
[3:36:42.800 --> 3:36:50.320]  serious the most serious economic crisis in world history in modern history and it's going to be
[3:36:50.320 --> 3:37:00.000]  exacerbated by the wars the sanctions that trump went on trump biden trump biden greenberg guys so
[3:37:00.000 --> 3:37:04.480]  this is going to get to me it's a it's a crime syndicate that people call the government these
[3:37:04.480 --> 3:37:10.320]  sanctions that they put on on russia are only hurting the people the facts are there with the
[3:37:10.320 --> 3:37:17.440]  wheat prices the barley prices the sunflower oil prices on and on and on gas prices oh today
[3:37:17.440 --> 3:37:23.200]  markets opened up and and and Brent crude went down a bit oh but then they went back up because
[3:37:23.200 --> 3:37:29.360]  of the problems yeah no kidding look what you're paying for gas look what you're paying to heat your house
[3:37:32.320 --> 3:37:33.120]  you ready for this
[3:37:36.640 --> 3:37:42.640]  they put a note on my door from central Hudson one of my buildings one building
[3:37:42.640 --> 3:37:51.920]  it's saturday we owe seven thousand three hundred and something dollars in
[3:37:54.080 --> 3:38:01.600]  bills for electric in any huge building it's a nice size it's not you know it's a two-story
[3:38:01.600 --> 3:38:08.640]  building 1750 Franz Rogan house they've been sending it to the wrong email and never sending us
[3:38:08.640 --> 3:38:13.200]  by direct mail over seven thousand dollars
[3:38:16.320 --> 3:38:18.240]  business is not going to bounce back
[3:38:20.720 --> 3:38:27.200]  wages are way below the real inflation level real inflation is double what they're telling us it is
[3:38:27.200 --> 3:38:34.880]  so it's 8.5 it's really you know 19 percent 17 where eight and eight is 16 17 percent not good at
[3:38:34.880 --> 3:38:42.720]  math and and and that's John Williams shadow stats so even with the fake inflation number of 8.5
[3:38:42.720 --> 3:38:47.360]  percent you know real wages are down you know what three four five four percent
[3:38:50.240 --> 3:38:57.040]  price of everything going up so what you want to do is you want to hedge against this and i'm not
[3:38:57.040 --> 3:39:03.040]  telling you what to do but gold bars many products they have a lot of great products and info was
[3:39:03.040 --> 3:39:09.040]  that's i got to tell you my favorite along with that supermail vitality you know you got to keep
[3:39:09.040 --> 3:39:14.960]  going you know you know that's the other thing the older you get the more you have to do you
[3:39:14.960 --> 3:39:18.960]  know you think i want to work out every day and i say to myself look i got to do this for the rest
[3:39:18.960 --> 3:39:26.240]  of my life you know i see guys my age they get that guy wasn't a Murray but the guy that they
[3:39:26.240 --> 3:39:33.280]  that they were comedian over there that uh with all the news because they they stopped the production
[3:39:33.280 --> 3:39:38.080]  Bill Murray or something i remember him when he spent saturday night live and i looked at this guy
[3:39:38.080 --> 3:39:44.240]  i'm not oh this guy's like four years younger than me i said i hope i don't look like this cat man
[3:39:45.040 --> 3:39:49.200]  the older you get the more you have to do the older you get the more you have to do
[3:39:49.200 --> 3:39:55.280]  and then for what it says a lot of those great products and again you're helping yourself as
[3:39:55.280 --> 3:39:59.920]  well as helping info wars but the bottom line really is that you're helping yourself more than
[3:39:59.920 --> 3:40:05.600]  anybody because we need to keep the truth alive that they're coming out with this disinformation
[3:40:06.160 --> 3:40:14.400]  you know baloney you know they had this article on on info wars and he quoted Tulsi Gabbard a
[3:40:14.400 --> 3:40:19.360]  democrat cited obama's remarks at stanford university last week calling on social media
[3:40:19.360 --> 3:40:25.520]  platforms to ramp up censorship of political speech he doesn't like characterizing the infringement
[3:40:25.520 --> 3:40:32.160]  of free speeches quote content moderation boy gerbils would have loved you obama
[3:40:34.640 --> 3:40:39.040]  now the good news is that almost all big tech platforms now acknowledge some responsibility
[3:40:39.040 --> 3:40:46.640]  for content on their platforms and they're investing in large team of people to monitor it
[3:40:46.640 --> 3:40:52.720]  monitor it obama said give the sheer volume of content this strategy can feel like a game
[3:40:52.720 --> 3:40:58.960]  of whack-a-mole isn't that funny huh whack-a-mole yeah look at it look at this arrogant arrogant

[3:48:28.640 --> 3:48:35.280]  right recommends masks indoors you know it's very important remember when you go into a restaurant
[3:48:35.280 --> 3:48:42.320]  on indoors that you walk in with the mask on and then when you sit down you can take the
[3:48:42.320 --> 3:48:49.840]  mask off to eat because coven only goes at the height and when you're walking up it's never
[3:48:49.840 --> 3:48:56.880]  a table length bars are higher than tables but they know you're sitting at a bar so the covert
[3:48:56.880 --> 3:49:05.360]  doesn't go there either they're making this up this isn't science it's political science just like
[3:49:05.360 --> 3:49:11.760]  the stupidity of wearing a mask on when you go into an airplane you can eat and drink without the
[3:49:11.760 --> 3:49:17.200]  mask on but when you finish eating and drinking put the mask on because the covert knows that you
[3:49:17.200 --> 3:49:23.760]  stopped eating and drinking so it's going to get you and again this guy adams like the mayor

[3:53:01.840 --> 3:53:08.560]  the international community should respond to these threats in a way that runs contrary to putin's
[3:53:08.560 --> 3:53:15.280]  expectations my opinion who's your opinion ain't here
