[00:00.000 --> 00:28.760]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:28.760 --> 00:35.680]  The area on Twitter wrote that everyone who touches Zelensky resigns, which is interesting.
[00:35.680 --> 00:41.880]  After failing the UK at every opportunity to serve globalist interests, Boris Johnson
[00:41.880 --> 00:49.880]  resigns as Prime Minister, to which the Russian Kremlin expressed good written.
[00:49.880 --> 00:56.160]  Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, who helped deliver Italian weapons to Ukraine and rallied
[00:56.160 --> 01:03.040]  support for Ukraine's entry into the EU, announced his resignation.
[01:03.040 --> 01:09.040]  Last month, Estonian Prime Minister Kasia Kalas expelled the populist center-left center
[01:09.040 --> 01:14.760]  party, claiming that she needed to form a new government to support Ukraine in their
[01:14.760 --> 01:17.240]  war against Russia.
[01:17.240 --> 01:23.120]  And on Thursday, Kalas officially resigned as a formality to form a new government, which
[01:23.120 --> 01:28.000]  she has already reached a consensus between the center-right reform party, the Social
[01:28.000 --> 01:34.360]  Democrats, and the conservative Fatherland party, to form a new three-party government
[01:34.360 --> 01:37.120]  to support Ukraine.
[01:37.120 --> 01:43.480]  And Sri Lanka's president, Godabaya Rajapaksa, who supported the Ukraine despite sanctions
[01:43.480 --> 01:50.680]  crippling his own nation, emailed in his resignation after fleeing the country.
[01:50.680 --> 01:57.640]  Beyond resignations, and beyond meet and greets with Ukraine's puppet President Zelensky,
[01:57.640 --> 02:05.640]  we have also just seen the assassination of popular anti-globalist leader Shinzo Abe,
[02:05.640 --> 02:12.200]  and the dramatic loss of confidence expressed by the people towards Macron, Trudeau, and
[02:12.200 --> 02:13.700]  Biden.
[02:13.700 --> 02:15.720]  What is happening here?
[02:15.720 --> 02:21.560]  From Celia Farber's The Truth Barrier, Catherine Austen Fitz explains that we are seeing a
[02:21.560 --> 02:29.640]  clean-out or political castration of leaders, Draghi, Johnson, Biden, Macron, Abe.
[02:29.640 --> 02:36.360]  Their political capital is exhausted, and or they will not push the next wave aggressively.
[02:36.360 --> 02:42.760]  Mr. Global is looking to bring in a whole new round of fresh, meaner leadership.
[02:42.760 --> 02:48.560]  The next wave is total collapse, and it's not easy to find people willing to be the
[02:48.560 --> 02:51.640]  fall guy for the destruction of a nation.
[02:51.640 --> 02:58.040]  It takes a special type of person, which might explain why California Governor Gavin Newsom
[02:58.040 --> 03:03.840]  visited the White House right after Joe Biden was shuffled off to Israel to mumble about
[03:03.840 --> 03:06.160]  the Holocaust.
[03:06.160 --> 03:13.680]  Biden is even unsettling to the stupid, and this entire operation requires stupidity,
[03:13.680 --> 03:16.760]  so things are going to keep getting stranger.
[03:16.760 --> 03:23.520]  But it probably won't last much longer, because the global financial reset is now imminent.
[03:23.520 --> 03:29.760]  Sri Lanka was just the beginning, and it looks like South Africa could be next, followed
[03:29.760 --> 03:31.680]  by everyone.
[03:31.680 --> 03:38.040]  The fiat fractional reserve banking scheme has been robbing the people blind for decades.
[03:38.040 --> 03:44.320]  But eventually, all the money runs out, and the financial pundits are all saying, it's
[03:44.320 --> 03:45.320]  this year.
[03:45.320 --> 03:51.480]  The dollar has just reached parity with the euro, and fudging the numbers will no longer
[03:51.480 --> 03:52.480]  work.
[03:52.480 --> 03:56.960]  They have only one solution left, and that's war.
[03:56.960 --> 04:03.080]  War has often been used to save failing fiat currencies, and having no other options, the
[04:03.080 --> 04:08.840]  psychotic bureaucrats in charge will go to war with Russia, which will only hasten the
[04:08.840 --> 04:11.040]  financial collapse of the West.
[04:11.040 --> 04:16.800]  If it comes to World War III, then it will be the final death blow, making way for a
[04:16.800 --> 04:18.480]  new system.
[04:18.480 --> 04:24.320]  Which means that unless you're holding on to real money, you will soon be broke, because
[04:24.320 --> 04:31.840]  all that paper in our wallets and numbers on our screens is going to soon be worthless.
[04:31.840 --> 04:34.320]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[04:34.320 --> 04:40.920]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I want you to get ready, because I've been on there
[04:40.920 --> 04:47.960]  28 years, and I'm about to cover the biggest news we've ever broken on this show.
[04:47.960 --> 04:53.200]  And this is going to change the whole world, call everybody you know, whether you're listening
[04:53.200 --> 04:57.120]  to local AM and FM stations, TV stations, or on the Internet, and spread the links now.
[04:57.120 --> 05:01.600]  Wait till you hear this.
[05:01.600 --> 05:06.640]  Seven months ago, in December of 2021, we launched the first in the three-coin founding
[05:06.640 --> 05:09.960]  member series, George Washington slaying the dragon.
[05:09.960 --> 05:14.480]  Then, we launched the Tree of Liberty coin, and finally, the Second Amendment comment-ticket
[05:14.480 --> 05:16.160]  Molan lobby coin.
[05:16.160 --> 05:26.160]  There are only 75 coins left in the three-coin series, exclusively, right now, at 1776point.com.
[05:26.160 --> 05:31.680]  And for the final 75 people to become founding members of this big project we're launching
[05:31.680 --> 05:37.200]  in the near future, you'll also get a personal signed piece of art I made of the sheepdog
[05:37.200 --> 05:39.120]  chasing the wolf in a personal message.
[05:39.120 --> 05:45.880]  It's your last chance to get all three coins at 1776point.com.
[05:45.880 --> 05:51.320]  This is history happening now, info workstations support is changing the world, and this is
[05:51.320 --> 06:17.320]  the final 75 three-coin set, exclusively available at 1776point.com.
[06:17.320 --> 06:24.320]  Finally, we'll so does he, live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:24.320 --> 06:33.080]  All right, my friends, we're live on this Sunday, July 17th, emergency transmission.
[06:33.080 --> 06:39.360]  The bill was introduced about five days ago, it didn't hit the news until Friday.
[06:39.360 --> 06:43.680]  I covered the news articles about the legislation, but I hadn't read the legislation till this
[06:43.680 --> 06:50.360]  weekend, and knowing what I know about the globalist, the police state, the design collapse,
[06:50.360 --> 06:56.240]  and then going and reading the legislation itself, it's 100% cut and dry, no if ands
[06:56.240 --> 07:06.280]  or buts, what it is, and something this big needs to be built up, I've learned if we just
[07:06.280 --> 07:09.560]  come right on there and tell you what's going on, nobody seems to care, it gets mixed in
[07:09.560 --> 07:14.560]  with all the other fantastical news, they do that on purpose, oh look, UPin nominates
[07:14.560 --> 07:19.560]  transgender swimmer Liz Thomas for NCAA Woman of the Year Award, that's all red meat to
[07:19.560 --> 07:28.240]  distract us, it's important but it's still a distraction.
[07:28.240 --> 07:34.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, starting at the next segment for the balance of this broadcast,
[07:34.880 --> 07:47.120]  I'm going to lay out hands down the most powerful, dangerous, horrible information we have ever
[07:47.120 --> 07:49.840]  covered in 28 years.
[07:49.840 --> 08:02.560]  This is five times worse than anything we've ever covered, I'll cover it in a moment.
[08:02.560 --> 08:10.040]  When they are able to execute it, it is a thousand times worse than anything we've ever
[08:10.040 --> 08:21.360]  covered, it is HR 4350, now I get busy, I get distracted, I'm running around just trying
[08:21.360 --> 08:26.000]  to fund info wars and take care of the crew and run our operations and in the past I would
[08:26.000 --> 08:30.880]  read a bill like this but instead I read the news headlines about it and they were bad
[08:30.880 --> 08:38.360]  enough and I said what it was but I hadn't read the bill until the crew members said
[08:38.360 --> 08:46.760]  hey you better read this, ladies and gentlemen, it's completely out in the open, they don't
[08:46.760 --> 08:55.020]  cover anything up and what's key is they've already implemented this, they know that there's
[08:55.020 --> 09:02.000]  oversight hearings coming so they want a legislation that it can't be looked at so everybody knows
[09:02.000 --> 09:07.360]  or at least you know history you know that Hitler was elected, they have a lower and
[09:07.360 --> 09:12.360]  upper house, they have two parliaments, lower and upper parliament, you have the president
[09:12.360 --> 09:19.920]  and you have the chancellor, Hitler was elected the president in 1933 and a few months later
[09:19.920 --> 09:26.080]  he fire bombed the capitol building and blamed it on his political enemies and then the government
[09:26.080 --> 09:32.800]  passed dictatorial power to him so Hitler was elected but after the Reichstag fire on
[09:32.800 --> 09:40.440]  April 27th 1933 he was given dictatorial power and became a dictator, now I want to explain
[09:40.440 --> 09:51.160]  something, this is 100% cut and dry, they admit it, it's all here.
[09:51.160 --> 09:55.480]  The Democrat leadership and they have the votes in the House of Senate has introduced
[09:55.480 --> 10:01.080]  a bill to make Joe Biden a dictator or whoever else the president is and you're like okay
[10:01.080 --> 10:06.160]  well that's bad enough, we covered that Friday, no oversight, the president runs the military
[10:06.160 --> 10:11.680]  for domestic operations, unbelievably illegal, violence, positive commentators you name it,
[10:11.680 --> 10:16.200]  this is what takes over all the third world countries.
[10:16.200 --> 10:22.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's any president, they're going to kill Biden or he's going
[10:22.920 --> 10:26.920]  to die in his sleep, they're going to kill him and they're going to put Gavin Newsom
[10:26.920 --> 10:36.720]  in, that's the word under Pelosi's control and you ignore this at your peril, this is
[10:36.720 --> 10:44.560]  100% and I feel a great weight lifted off of me because I knew this was coming and I
[10:44.560 --> 10:51.760]  fought it as hard as I could and we had a former NFL running back on who, running for
[10:51.760 --> 10:59.880]  Congress, we talked about Vince Lombardi leaving it all in the field, baby I've left it all
[10:59.880 --> 11:04.520]  in the field, I've done everything I could to stop this and I feel terrible about it
[11:04.520 --> 11:08.360]  but you're not going to need Alex Jones to tell you anymore about anything, I mean you
[11:08.360 --> 11:13.320]  already think stuff's bad, they couldn't forcefully inoculate you, they're going to make Joe Biden
[11:13.320 --> 11:19.920]  a dictator, they're going to implode the economy, they're going to do new lockdowns in the fall
[11:19.920 --> 11:24.320]  and then bigger than Dallas, either right before the midterms or during the general
[11:24.320 --> 11:30.040]  election they're going to blow his head off or truck bomb his ass and blame yours truly
[11:30.040 --> 11:40.120]  and Trump, guaranteed, now I'm not going to get on an airplane and run to some other country,
[11:40.120 --> 11:46.560]  I pledge to stay here and go down with the ship but I'm now on a suicide mission, not
[11:46.560 --> 11:54.280]  that I'm going to be violent but it's like Obi-Wan Kenobi with Darth Vader at this point,
[11:54.280 --> 11:59.120]  they're going to take us out but you've got to escape the Millennium Falcon back to base
[11:59.120 --> 12:03.120]  and come back and take out the Death Star and I'm just telling you that right now folks,
[12:03.120 --> 12:06.520]  you're going to see it all unfold just like I told you Trump would announce in July he
[12:06.520 --> 12:12.600]  announced last week that he's going to run, I don't make stuff up, I'm really wrong, there's
[12:12.600 --> 12:19.680]  no debate now, I don't need to have my opinions about this, when you know what's in the legislation
[12:19.680 --> 12:26.160]  and you know the groups and the back story and the organization, when I read the bill
[12:26.160 --> 12:32.560]  I felt like I got plugged into 10 trillion volts of electricity, I mean it's total martial
[12:32.560 --> 12:44.800]  law and they say they're going to target Trump voters and conservatives and quote right wingers
[12:44.800 --> 12:53.040]  and it is a literal declaration of war where they make Biden a dictator and then they declare
[12:53.040 --> 12:57.280]  all of us enemy combatants and come after us, can you imagine that job for the military
[12:57.280 --> 13:06.720]  and the police, I mean just on that level it's a suicide mission.
[13:06.720 --> 13:11.120]  This is the end of America and the end of the world as we know it, governments are collapsing
[13:11.120 --> 13:20.680]  everywhere, food is basically nonexistent in many countries, there's no going back now,
[13:20.680 --> 13:23.920]  there's no reversing it, let me just give you a little news flash, I said three years
[13:23.920 --> 13:30.360]  ago or two and a half years ago I said when the U.N. comes out and says there's food shortages
[13:30.360 --> 13:35.680]  and look out that they've been running their operation, they've done that now and I'm going
[13:35.680 --> 13:41.800]  to try to comport myself as best I can and just come back and go through this one point
[13:41.800 --> 13:47.400]  after another but everyone watching on a local TV station or listening on a local radio station
[13:47.400 --> 13:52.000]  or watching an info wars dot com port slash show or band up video or wherever you do it,
[13:52.000 --> 13:56.680]  you better take the live link of this show and you better once it's archived tonight
[13:56.680 --> 14:00.760]  take clips out of it and you better share it everywhere because there's a way to stop
[14:00.760 --> 14:05.280]  this but first I'm going to tell you what they've already done and what they're about
[14:05.280 --> 14:10.680]  to do and their own admissions in black and white and then how we stop them but there's
[14:10.680 --> 14:21.320]  not much time, we've got a Hail Mary moonshot to stop them now if people really get serious
[14:21.320 --> 14:28.240]  and cut it all the clutter and get this, we can still stop this, it's a death sentence
[14:28.240 --> 14:33.200]  for me if this happens, it's a death sentence for the police officers and military and the
[14:33.200 --> 14:38.080]  FBI, I don't want to be in a war with you, I'm not going to be in a war with you, not
[14:38.080 --> 14:40.800]  because I'm a coward because I realize it's to bring the country down and have us all
[14:40.800 --> 14:50.720]  kill each other but you will be destroyed, the people carrying this out will be destroyed,
[14:50.720 --> 14:55.400]  or the detonator to bring down America, they've got the left ready and spoiling for a war
[14:55.400 --> 14:59.160]  with America and American gun owners and American veterans and I'm just telling everybody
[14:59.160 --> 15:06.360]  right now because they'll kill me or whatever and then say I'm some 3D, deep fake, Jones
[15:06.360 --> 15:10.560]  is commanding the rebel forces, none of that's true and I've already seen every angle of
[15:10.560 --> 15:13.680]  this and now it's crystal clear I've got their whole battle plan and I know how to
[15:13.680 --> 15:16.720]  beat them so this could be one of our last broadcast folks, I'm telling you any day now
[15:16.720 --> 15:20.600]  it's getting shut down, I've felt it in my spirit, I've known it, we fought as hard
[15:20.600 --> 15:25.640]  as we could and I appreciate the crew but it's all over now unless there is a giant
[15:25.640 --> 15:30.960]  complete awakening by governors and legislatures and others and just a total in the streets
[15:30.960 --> 15:36.240]  peacefully saying no to Biden being a dictator and Biden doesn't even know who he is, they're
[15:36.240 --> 15:41.440]  going to kill him and they're going to put Newsom in, it's already been set up, they
[15:41.440 --> 15:44.720]  stole the election, that's the first part of the coup, the second part of the coup that's
[15:44.720 --> 15:49.680]  permanent is about to go down and of course Trump doesn't even know what's going on, he's
[15:49.680 --> 15:52.960]  a good guy overall but he has no idea and oh by the way they're going to kill Trump
[15:52.960 --> 16:00.440]  too, they're going to kill him 100% so when they kill Biden they'll also kill Trump.
[16:00.440 --> 16:05.800]  Seven months ago in December of 2021 we launched the first in the three-coin founding member
[16:05.800 --> 16:10.880]  series, George Washington slaying the dragon, then we launched the Tree of Liberty coin
[16:10.880 --> 16:17.240]  and finally the Second Amendment come and take it Molan Labe coin, there are only 75
[16:17.240 --> 16:26.680]  coins left in the three-point series exclusively right now at 1776point.com and for the final

[17:00.400 --> 17:05.800]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading

[17:27.400 --> 17:32.240]  natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[17:32.240 --> 17:36.960]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[17:36.960 --> 17:41.680]  shown as for vitamin C and zinc themselves you probably already know that they play an
[17:41.680 --> 17:46.800]  important role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health,
[17:46.800 --> 17:51.920]  it has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations

[20:06.560 --> 20:20.320]  It happened in ancient Rome, it happened in Russia, it happened in Nazi Germany, it happened
[20:20.320 --> 20:27.240]  in China, in Venezuela and hundreds of other countries and now it's happening in the USA,
[20:27.240 --> 20:32.280]  Marshall Law, Red Alert, Democrat leadership introduces Bill to give by the powers of a
[20:32.280 --> 20:39.160]  dictator and use the military against quote, right wing with no congressional oversight
[20:39.160 --> 20:44.240]  and it specifically says it's run by the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Democratic
[20:44.240 --> 20:53.960]  Party and the ADL, wow, I have the bill, I'm going to read it to you, I have the articles,
[20:53.960 --> 20:59.280]  I have the congressional clips, it's unbelievable and we have the whole backstory on it and
[20:59.280 --> 21:03.800]  I've researched every facet of this and I'm not just saying that to say, oh, I'm smart,
[21:03.800 --> 21:10.040]  this is what we do and again, Friday, oh, the bill's introduced to have no congressional
[21:10.040 --> 21:14.480]  oversight under domestic operations and Congress gives power to the president, that's the
[21:14.480 --> 21:19.240]  endopausic commentatus, that's dictatorial powers, that's Marshall Law, but I didn't
[21:19.240 --> 21:24.400]  read the bill because I was so distracted and busy, I read the bill, it's a very long
[21:24.400 --> 21:32.480]  bill, read parts of it and it just cut and dry in the first few pages, says Congress
[21:32.480 --> 21:40.000]  will no longer be over military operations inside CONUS, continental United States and
[21:40.000 --> 21:44.720]  these organizations and at least governmental and non-governmental organizations will run
[21:44.720 --> 21:50.880]  the military and they will have the oversight and Congress will give it to the Democrat
[21:50.880 --> 21:58.720]  party and its organizations, I mean, I'm going to read the bill in a moment to you, the sections,
[21:58.720 --> 22:05.040]  I mean, this is unbelievable and when I saw this, I said this can't be right, we went
[22:05.040 --> 22:10.240]  to the congressional website, it's on the congressional website and it's the leadership
[22:10.240 --> 22:17.800]  sponsoring it and what's key here is they've already been doing this for a year and a half,
[22:17.800 --> 22:23.880]  we already have the pieces of it, now they know there's oversight and main line Pentagon
[22:23.880 --> 22:29.640]  watchdog groups are really concerned and senators are concerned and house members, we have video
[22:29.640 --> 22:38.360]  of that, we're going to play that segment and they're saying to Millie, so you really
[22:38.360 --> 22:44.120]  took over the government the last month of Trump because they did and so what we've had
[22:44.120 --> 22:48.440]  is a military dictatorship run by the globalist takeover and we had a purge the military with
[22:48.440 --> 22:56.280]  the injections and critical race theory and transgenderism and it's all here, we had the
[22:56.280 --> 23:04.360]  takeover, we had the operation, we had the purge and now they say that the main war footing
[23:04.360 --> 23:09.800]  of the US military is not the Russians or the Iranians or the Chinese
[23:09.800 --> 23:22.120]  or the Mexican mafia or MS-13 or human smugglers, it says that Congress is giving up its power
[23:22.120 --> 23:28.560]  of oversight and the purse and giving it to the president and then I thought well that's
[23:28.560 --> 23:37.360]  going to be used against us and I read the bill and it says it's for us, cut and dry,
[23:37.360 --> 23:43.960]  no debate in your face while a worldwide collapse goes on, while world leaders are assassinated,
[23:43.960 --> 23:52.320]  while borders collapse, while currencies implode, they're not going to do it, they've already
[23:52.320 --> 23:59.720]  done it and now finally a few senators and house members are like what's going on and
[23:59.720 --> 24:05.000]  we now know the military and the FBI had thousands of military and FBI in plain clothes with
[24:05.000 --> 24:12.320]  weapons on January 6th breaking into the Capitol and that's their Reichstag, they intended
[24:12.320 --> 24:15.440]  to have people kidnap members of Congress and the rest of it but it didn't go off the
[24:15.440 --> 24:20.560]  way they wanted, they intended to have people blow up the Capitol building, you remember
[24:20.560 --> 24:25.120]  the pipe bombs and the rest of it but it didn't get carried out because the intel we have
[24:25.120 --> 24:28.400]  is a lot of people in the federal government, the federal government's not our enemy, it's
[24:28.400 --> 24:33.080]  been hijacked and run, like the Germans weren't the enemy in World War II, Hitler was in control,
[24:33.080 --> 24:36.960]  he told them to do it, sure they shouldn't have followed orders but we know that the
[24:36.960 --> 24:41.080]  military and the police don't want to do this, that's why they're like oh you're not going
[24:41.080 --> 24:48.000]  to do it, we're going to purge you or oh your cops, we're going to defund you but it doesn't
[24:48.000 --> 24:53.880]  matter because they've got the media, they've got the courts, they've got the house, the
[24:53.880 --> 24:58.080]  Senate and the presidency through fraud and they're not going to let us take the country
[24:58.080 --> 25:03.160]  back from them without staging massive false flags as the pretext for this to happen and
[25:03.160 --> 25:09.560]  I believe the main false flag will be the assassination of Biden, which I'm totally against happening
[25:09.560 --> 25:15.680]  and they've got Governor Newsom ready to come in with Pelosi and all of them behind it, so
[25:15.680 --> 25:25.040]  ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, there's almost no news coverage of this but
[25:25.040 --> 25:29.360]  the House and Senate in hearings are talking about it, that's next segment but they're
[25:29.360 --> 25:32.640]  only getting part of it, so General Milley, you ignored the president for a month and
[25:32.640 --> 25:38.800]  you were basically acting president and their answer is a bill saying hey, well now that
[25:38.800 --> 25:43.920]  we have the president, we're outside of Congress and the president do it every once and then
[25:43.920 --> 25:50.080]  the president becomes a puppet they control through this dictatorship, we have lived
[25:50.080 --> 25:58.000]  to see it ladies and gentlemen, we are now here in July 17th, the Sunday broadcast and
[25:58.000 --> 26:02.480]  what is incredible is we're like the frog in the boiling pot, it's incrementally turned
[26:02.480 --> 26:06.040]  up, we boil, I know all about this, I knew they were planning this under Clinton and
[26:06.040 --> 26:11.120]  others, didn't have the balls to launch it, Obama wanted to do it too and then I'm so
[26:11.120 --> 26:14.880]  close to the problem, made four police state films about the impending martial law playing
[26:14.880 --> 26:22.400]  all of it and now we're in it, this bill was introduced five days ago and I just now discovered
[26:22.400 --> 26:28.640]  it and covering it, imagine how much that freaks me out, I'm begging you for myself
[26:28.640 --> 26:35.360]  and my family and you and your family and all of us to go read the bill and to take
[26:35.360 --> 26:39.360]  the archive of this live show and share it and take clubs out and get it out there because
[26:39.360 --> 26:44.360]  this is a life and death situation and I'm telling members of Congress and legislatures
[26:44.360 --> 26:49.040]  and governors, if you don't come out against this now, when the border has already been
[26:49.040 --> 26:54.560]  collapsed by design, that's martial law, when we're being surveilled and censored and attacked
[26:54.560 --> 26:59.880]  and we're being told domestic terrorist Republicans are the number one terror threat and the Democrats
[26:59.880 --> 27:06.120]  want to outlaw the Republican Party and the headlines are oh, Schiff wants to block some
[27:06.120 --> 27:13.800]  oversight of some military operations in America and then you read the bill and it says we
[27:13.800 --> 27:18.280]  have centers and organizations that will advise us from the Democratic Party, the Southern
[27:18.280 --> 27:23.320]  Property Law Center and the ADL that are declaring domestic enemies and the military
[27:23.320 --> 27:28.920]  with no oversight, the CIA and Air, Land and Sea and all five branches of the military
[27:28.920 --> 27:35.640]  are preparing for war with the American people, you know they're going to trigger the pretext
[27:35.640 --> 27:47.480]  for that operation, just like they did 600 years ago with Henry IV, staging false flags
[27:47.480 --> 27:55.720]  in England to go to war with France, it's all repeating, Hitler and the Reichstag, so
[27:55.720 --> 28:02.520]  many other events but this is domestically against the American people with the backdrop
[28:02.520 --> 28:07.480]  of the worldwide collapse and the inflation and the doddering idiot president and then
[28:07.480 --> 28:14.760]  he gets assassinated or he dies in his sleep and in comes the savior and that savior is
[28:14.760 --> 28:22.760]  given dictatorial power handed by Congress, here we're no longer in charge and no one
[28:22.760 --> 28:27.560]  can oversight you and we're like I bet that'll be against the American people and I'm like
[28:27.560 --> 28:36.040]  let me read the bill, oh it is, it says the enemy isn't the chai comms, isn't the Cubans,
[28:36.040 --> 28:42.640]  the communists, no it's us, we have lived to see it, I'm going to go through it all in
[28:42.640 --> 28:49.680]  detail word for word when we come back, biggest development ever in American history, this
[28:49.680 --> 28:55.160]  is they are trying to normalize and legalize the dictatorship, they're already putting

[33:34.080 --> 33:42.200]  they're just trying to legalize it after they've already done it, but anything that violates
[33:42.200 --> 33:47.200]  our rights or basic freedoms of the 10th Amendment is null and void.
[33:47.200 --> 33:52.320]  Legislation has been added to the new spending bill five days ago by Schiff, got no attention
[33:52.320 --> 33:58.160]  until over the weekend, the Democratic Party is backing this amendment, they control the
[33:58.160 --> 34:05.240]  House and Senate to say no oversight over the US military in domestic operations, but
[34:05.240 --> 34:11.320]  more importantly, only the president is in charge of the military, so that's martial
[34:11.320 --> 34:16.600]  law, that's dictatorial powers right there, then you're like, oh, but I bet the bill doesn't
[34:16.600 --> 34:24.080]  admit they're going to do that and then you read the bill and it says all of that and
[34:24.080 --> 34:29.080]  more.
[34:29.080 --> 34:33.480]  The military industrial complex, the president Eisenhower warned us about his farewell speech
[34:33.480 --> 34:37.960]  in 1961 is now happening.
[34:37.960 --> 34:41.600]  They know they stole the election, they know they usurped power from Trump, they know they
[34:41.600 --> 34:45.600]  had elements of the military in the FBI breaking the building and command the grips that went
[34:45.600 --> 34:50.280]  in on January 6th, their Reichstag event that didn't go as bad as they hoped, so they had
[34:50.280 --> 34:56.000]  pre-written speeches saying it was worse than Pearl Harbor and worse than September 11th
[34:56.000 --> 35:00.880]  and now they've introduced legislation added to the main spending bill that looks like
[35:00.880 --> 35:08.560]  it's going to pass to give Biden dictatorial power, but it shows they've already done it.
[35:08.560 --> 35:13.520]  Here's the headline in FullWars.com, martial law, red alert, Democrat leadership introduces
[35:13.520 --> 35:18.640]  bill to give Biden the powers of a dictator and he's military against quote, right wing
[35:18.640 --> 35:26.480]  with no congressional oversight and no laws and I've got the bill amendment right here.
[35:26.480 --> 35:37.680]  This is the amendment added five days ago to HR 35, 4350, HR 4350, 4350.
[35:37.680 --> 35:44.080]  I am just speechless at this point and you see the headlines about it on Friday, shift
[35:44.080 --> 35:51.720]  seeks rule that would block oversight of some military operations, Washington Times.
[35:51.720 --> 35:55.880]  They're panicked, Adam Schiff moves to disrupt future investigations, U.S. military involvement
[35:55.880 --> 36:00.040]  January 6th, can't wait to punt it, but they're just looking at that.
[36:00.040 --> 36:04.400]  Pentagon watchdogs calling General Mark Milley to answer allegations he usurped President
[36:04.400 --> 36:08.800]  Trump after January 6th and there's currently a military dictatorship, that's senators
[36:08.800 --> 36:12.720]  asking him about it, that's coming up.
[36:12.720 --> 36:15.920]  Dr. Carlson talks about the New York Times defending RAE apps running around saying go
[36:15.920 --> 36:20.720]  in the Capitol.
[36:20.720 --> 36:28.480]  But everyone is eating around the edges of HR 4350, we're not going to do that.
[36:28.480 --> 36:43.480]  We're going to show you what this amendment says and it says the president, read this
[36:43.480 --> 36:50.200]  for yourself, will have the sole power over the military domestically and Congress will
[36:50.200 --> 36:52.480]  have no oversight.
[36:52.480 --> 37:03.200]  And it says Section 529A, this is absolutely fee.
[37:03.200 --> 37:09.080]  Section 529A, countering extremism in the armed forces.
[37:09.080 --> 37:17.800]  So a purge of the military of anybody that supports populism or America.
[37:17.800 --> 37:22.880]  Part two of subtitle A10, United States code, is about adding at the end of the following
[37:22.880 --> 37:27.800]  new chapter, Chapter 89, then you've got to go to the chapters, we did that.
[37:27.800 --> 37:33.160]  And it has an office of countering extremism that's advised by the Democratic Party at
[37:33.160 --> 37:39.360]  the consortium of NGOs, training and education, then it goes on to say, not just for the military,
[37:39.360 --> 37:40.360]  but for the American people.
[37:40.360 --> 37:43.400]  But if you're going to have a martial law takeover seat, you've got to first get your
[37:43.400 --> 37:49.280]  military in line like Hitler did in 1933 after the Reichstag fire with an oath to do what
[37:49.280 --> 37:54.240]  he says.
[37:54.240 --> 37:58.080]  There is an office of countering extremism in this section referred to as the office
[37:58.080 --> 38:03.000]  with the office of the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, but then that
[38:03.000 --> 38:08.440]  ties in the previous legislation and regulations to the American people.
[38:08.440 --> 38:12.960]  Number two, the office shall be headed by the director of counter extremism in the chapter
[38:12.960 --> 38:20.520]  referred to as the director for domestic operations, who shall be appointed by the secretary of
[38:20.520 --> 38:25.960]  defense in consultation with the secretary of homeland security and report directly to
[38:25.960 --> 38:31.240]  the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness for the secretary.
[38:31.240 --> 38:37.520]  Be responsible for a policy of countering extremism, living in armed forces.
[38:37.520 --> 38:42.640]  But again, he tied the code, it says for America with the military over, for domestic operations.
[38:42.640 --> 38:46.800]  In coordination with the secretaries of the military departments, develop and implement
[38:46.800 --> 38:51.920]  programs, resources and activities to counter extremism within the armed forces, they keep
[38:51.920 --> 38:52.920]  saying that.
[38:52.920 --> 38:53.920]  But in the code, it says America.
[38:53.920 --> 38:58.440]  Number three, establish policies to ensure adequate protection, transparency, the process
[38:58.440 --> 39:03.280]  and availability of resources of individuals who report incidents of extremism, their
[39:03.280 --> 39:05.720]  operatives.
[39:05.720 --> 39:09.560]  Facilitate coordinate with the secretary of the military department, law enforcement
[39:09.560 --> 39:16.680]  organizations, security organizations, the CIA domestically, and insider threat programs.
[39:16.680 --> 39:21.600]  Engage, interact with and solicit recommendations from outside experts on extremism, you read
[39:21.600 --> 39:26.400]  the subsection at ADL, the private law center, the undersecretary of defense for intelligence
[39:26.400 --> 39:34.240]  and security, and it goes on to say that the main mission will be identifying and going
[39:34.240 --> 39:37.040]  after including civilians.
[39:37.040 --> 39:42.680]  You see right there, line 20, civilians.
[39:42.680 --> 39:47.200]  But when you read the code, not just the military, they've told you their main operation is the
[39:47.200 --> 39:49.280]  American people.
[39:49.280 --> 39:52.560]  What considers an extremist insider threat?
[39:52.560 --> 39:54.800]  Risk posed by extremists insider threats.
[39:54.800 --> 39:55.800]  How to identify it?
[39:55.800 --> 39:57.840]  It goes on and on and on and on.
[39:57.840 --> 40:07.000]  Media literacy training, rainwashing, whistleblower protections against patriots.
[40:07.000 --> 40:14.720]  And it goes on to talk about commissioning officers that are trained in extremism.
[40:14.720 --> 40:15.920]  And it goes on and on.
[40:15.920 --> 40:19.760]  We've got larger sections of the bill right here, where when women get raped, there's
[40:19.760 --> 40:21.760]  no due process.
[40:21.760 --> 40:23.160]  It all gets covered up.
[40:23.160 --> 40:28.600]  You want to read chapter 89, countering extremism.
[40:28.600 --> 40:32.200]  And you see the FBI saying the main threats, American gun owners and conservatives.
[40:32.200 --> 40:37.560]  And what, the what?
[40:37.560 --> 40:45.800]  The cities, the school boards with the SJW, transgenderism, boys, raping girls in bathrooms,
[40:45.800 --> 40:53.360]  critical race theory, C, and the office of countering extremism interfacing with the
[40:53.360 --> 40:58.280]  other offices of countering extremism in the civilian departments for domestic operations
[40:58.280 --> 41:00.520]  outside of congressional authority.
[41:00.520 --> 41:08.760]  This insider threat training, literal domestic purging operations, but the key is no congressional
[41:08.760 --> 41:09.760]  oversight.
[41:09.760 --> 41:13.600]  Establish and maintain a database on extremist activities, the armed forces, and ensure the
[41:13.600 --> 41:20.600]  data collected across the military departments in uniform and maximum extent, practicable.
[41:20.600 --> 41:27.680]  And then it gets in to letting women be raped and have no due processes at the military.
[41:27.680 --> 41:31.040]  It is just lawlessness writ large.
[41:31.040 --> 41:39.440]  Section 529D, distribution of information, unavailable of civilian victim services.
[41:39.440 --> 41:45.040]  So the big takeaway is no congressional oversight of what the military does, Biden handed electoral
[41:45.040 --> 41:49.680]  powers for domestic military operations period, and then it talks about rooting out the military
[41:49.680 --> 41:56.000]  and extremist and then interfacing with civilian organizations and working with them.
[41:56.000 --> 41:59.480]  Now they've already done all this.
[41:59.480 --> 42:04.320]  Now they're simply covering their ass and rolling it all out, we'll play some clips
[42:04.320 --> 42:08.760]  from congressional hearings on this that's getting almost no coverage.
[42:08.760 --> 42:13.560]  But you add the worldwide collapse, you add all the hype, you add the Civil War talk,
[42:13.560 --> 42:17.080]  you add the January 6th committee hearings, you add all the political prisoners, you see
[42:17.080 --> 42:23.280]  that's a beta test to then expand this whole operation across the board.
[42:23.280 --> 42:28.760]  Then there's, I got a stack of news here, talking about force lockdowns and force inoculations
[42:28.760 --> 42:33.720]  and force masking coming back in the fall and it's officially being announced by the
[42:33.720 --> 42:38.840]  Democratic Party, HR 4350.
[42:38.840 --> 42:42.680]  We're going to come back and play those clips, I talked about it more, but rather than just
[42:42.680 --> 42:47.000]  sit there and tell you what they're doing, next hour I'm going to talk about how we legally
[42:47.000 --> 42:50.680]  and lawfully counter this multinational W.E.F.
[42:50.680 --> 42:55.800]  Bilderberg coup through the Democratic Party, the bureaucracy and the Republican collaborators.
[42:55.800 --> 43:00.400]  Stay with us ladies and gentlemen.
[43:00.400 --> 43:05.760]  Seven months ago in December of 2021, we launched the first in the three-coin founding member
[43:05.760 --> 43:09.160]  series, George Washington slaying the dragon.
[43:09.160 --> 43:12.960]  Then we launched the Tree of Liberty coin and finally the second amendment, come and
[43:12.960 --> 43:14.960]  take it, Molan lobby coin.
[43:14.960 --> 43:24.960]  There are only 75 coins left in the three-coin series exclusively right now at 1776coin.com
[43:24.960 --> 43:30.480]  and for the final 75 people to become founding members for this big project we're launching
[43:30.480 --> 43:36.000]  in the near future, you'll also get a personal signed piece of art I made of the sheepdog
[43:36.000 --> 43:37.920]  chasing the wolf and a personal message.
[43:37.920 --> 43:44.680]  It's your last chance to get all three coins at 1776coin.com.

[43:59.960 --> 44:06.920]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here and that's
[44:06.920 --> 44:11.640]  what people recognize and resonate with and as word said you're not going to find a better
[44:11.640 --> 44:13.760]  place for information.

[44:42.680 --> 44:47.840]  giving this thing away, it's 75% off, by the way it works for me in case you haven't noticed.
[44:47.840 --> 44:54.880]  The hair and beard formula is working for me, quite well I might add, quite well my
[44:54.880 --> 45:00.080]  barber appreciates hair and beard support for men, I go and see them quite often now.
[45:00.080 --> 45:05.120]  We brought the game changing product previously only available to major oil companies around

[47:00.640 --> 47:14.040]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:14.040 --> 47:24.760]  There are a lot of moving parts to this, welcome back to the Sunday Emergency Broadcast, the
[47:24.760 --> 47:30.280]  Alex Jones show, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[47:30.280 --> 47:37.400]  Obama before he left office put a bunch of executive orders into place and had tagged
[47:37.400 --> 47:44.480]  on to the Defense Authorization Act of 2017 because they fund that in 2016 and in December
[47:44.480 --> 47:50.600]  they said countering domestic extremism, farm propaganda, a bunch of different pieces
[47:50.600 --> 47:57.120]  of subsections in and those were big and they put in digital martial law, surveillance,
[47:57.120 --> 48:01.040]  censorship and Trump was in, didn't know about all that, didn't understand it like this new
[48:01.040 --> 48:06.160]  tape release that they confirmed is real of Joe Biden when he was leaving office at the
[48:06.160 --> 48:14.720]  same time in late 2016 telling the Ukrainian president, Poroshenko, we don't want Trump
[48:14.720 --> 48:19.280]  to see the IMF agreements we have, he'll find out we stole a bunch of money, if you physically
[48:19.280 --> 48:23.120]  want to be safe and your country doesn't want to be invaded, you better do exactly as we
[48:23.120 --> 48:27.920]  say and pay off the IMF loans and shut it down so Trump doesn't look at it because
[48:27.920 --> 48:34.120]  if he figures it out, it's over, I'll play the tape next hour, it's all over the news,
[48:34.120 --> 48:39.240]  it's all over the news, it's on OAN in places being censored, it's on InfoWars.com, Biden
[48:39.240 --> 48:43.840]  threatens ex-Ukrainian president Poroshenko when he was in office with assassination
[48:43.840 --> 48:49.440]  and he cooperated with Trump, leaked audio reveals, it's before he had his stroke a little
[48:49.440 --> 48:55.800]  bit after that and you hear the bully, the gangster, the thug, the pedophile threatening
[48:55.800 --> 49:05.400]  him and of course he rolled over, just like he said on C-SPAN, I told that prosecutor,
[49:05.400 --> 49:09.520]  you don't stop your investigation, he's not fired, of me and my son, you won't get a
[49:09.520 --> 49:16.800]  billion dollars, the son of a bitch, he was let go six hours later, they brag on TV to
[49:16.800 --> 49:20.760]  all of us about what they're doing, so here's the other pieces, this has already been going
[49:20.760 --> 49:26.200]  on, they have a purge of the military, they have the military on January 6th, they have
[49:26.200 --> 49:29.440]  the military, spying on the American people, that's all admitted, it's all illegal and
[49:29.440 --> 49:35.000]  other agencies, the CIA, NSA, you name it and this just legalizes it, it's like little
[49:35.000 --> 49:41.080]  sublines and other agencies and all other agencies in domestic operations, so Congress
[49:41.080 --> 49:46.560]  has no oversight over the Pentagon and all other intelligence agencies and then it has
[49:46.560 --> 49:51.520]  a link to a subsection that describes what that means, 16 agencies, no oversight, a crude
[49:51.520 --> 49:57.240]  dictatorship of those that run our military and run the intelligence agencies and then
[49:57.240 --> 50:01.240]  a bunch of stuff to confuse it and make it look like it's just a purge the military and
[50:01.240 --> 50:05.440]  no due process in Congress over what happens to the military, that's bad enough and Biden
[50:05.440 --> 50:11.160]  being given control over oversight or whoever the president is, I would not support Trump
[50:11.160 --> 50:16.240]  having these powers, I would not support anybody having these powers, I mean this is cut and
[50:16.240 --> 50:20.640]  dry classical tyranny, so you've got that it's already in place, now they know people
[50:20.640 --> 50:25.360]  are finding out about it, it's coming out about REAPs and all of it, so they're trying
[50:25.360 --> 50:31.440]  to retroactively legalize it.
[50:31.440 --> 50:35.360]  Then there's the issue of what's the timing and how are they going to try to implement
[50:35.360 --> 50:41.000]  the full rollout of this publicly, which are starting, dollar collapse, saying the Russians
[50:41.000 --> 50:48.400]  hacked the energy grid, I mean you see them pre-programming all of that, a new virus outbreak,
[50:48.400 --> 50:51.640]  the collapse of local cities, which they've already been engineering, the defunding of
[50:51.640 --> 50:56.680]  police, you can see them bringing in the crime and the tyranny and the martial law that's
[50:56.680 --> 51:07.880]  already in place to then officially announce it and then there's the 60 quadrillion question,
[51:07.880 --> 51:14.480]  how do we stop this peacefully, because I've got clips on MSNBC and ABC and NBC and CNN
[51:14.480 --> 51:19.040]  this weekend that I've gotten a list, I intend to play, but Times Press is saying we're going
[51:19.040 --> 51:23.360]  to have a war with the right-wingers, all Republicans are terrorists, they want to kill
[51:23.360 --> 51:29.080]  us, we've got to kill them, I've got MSNBC clips saying we're going to war with the American
[51:29.080 --> 51:33.960]  people and it's going to happen, those are the useful idiots that have no idea what that's
[51:33.960 --> 51:38.120]  going to look like, it's going to chew up the military, chew up police, destroy all the
[51:38.120 --> 51:44.040]  feds and then the country will fully collapse and they'll bring in the UN.
[51:44.040 --> 51:47.800]  Everything that Clinton's planned, everything Obama fantasized about, about a domestic security
[51:47.800 --> 51:51.720]  force just as big and just as strong as their military, all the things they've been trying
[51:51.720 --> 51:55.800]  to get lined up that you see in Canada with martial law and you see in Germany and you
[51:55.800 --> 52:03.560]  see all over the place in Australia, they're brained here, because they know you're awake,
[52:03.560 --> 52:09.280]  they know you're aware of them, but because it's so outrageous to try to put it in martial
[52:09.280 --> 52:14.040]  law, it's so outrageous to make the president a dictator, it's so outrageous to say no congressional
[52:14.040 --> 52:19.240]  oversight of the military if it's domestic, Congress still wants that power to play footsie
[52:19.240 --> 52:25.520]  with the executive internationally, but not domestically, because they want to keep us
[52:25.520 --> 52:32.000]  tamped down, they're giving war powers to the president to wage war against the American
[52:32.000 --> 52:33.000]  people.
[52:33.000 --> 52:36.120]  So what's the timeline on that and how would they pull that off?
[52:36.120 --> 52:39.000]  That's a big issue.
[52:39.000 --> 52:40.120]  That's the number two issue.
[52:40.120 --> 52:42.520]  We know they're doing it, that's the third issue.
[52:42.520 --> 52:46.360]  The second biggest issue is what's the timeline, how would they pull that off?
[52:46.360 --> 52:53.720]  But the number one issue is how do we get the Joe Rogans, who I never even call them
[52:53.720 --> 52:58.720]  about politics, we're getting dinner this week, we get a speck of vacation, and Tucker Carlson
[52:58.720 --> 53:02.800]  and all those other people, but I can't do it all and I want to make the phone calls.
[53:02.800 --> 53:07.720]  I need you to burn up local talk radio lines and Congress and everything, and they'll try
[53:07.720 --> 53:11.400]  to push you off and say, we don't know what you're talking about, but major Pentagon watch
[53:11.400 --> 53:17.800]  dog groups that are mainline are saying this is dictatorial, this is the military ruling
[53:17.800 --> 53:18.800]  the U.S.
[53:18.800 --> 53:21.760]  This was already done in the last month of Trump when almost all of his administration
[53:21.760 --> 53:25.160]  resigned and left, and it turns out General Milley and the Democrats were already running
[53:25.160 --> 53:31.720]  stuff and refused his 10,000 National Guard at the Capitol and the ellipse and provocative.
[53:31.720 --> 53:35.800]  They planned it on being 100 times worse, 1,000 times worse, but it wasn't, but they're
[53:35.800 --> 53:41.480]  still going with Reichstag 2.0.
[53:41.480 --> 53:44.240]  So I mentioned some of these clips, let's just start going to them.
[53:44.240 --> 53:54.040]  Here is Jim Banks in Congress, General Mark Milley, Verifier Refute, Secretly Seizing Presidential
[53:54.040 --> 54:02.560]  Military Power, which Milley told CNN he took control of the military on January 6th.
[54:02.560 --> 54:08.760]  Well, Trump didn't try to call them out, but Milley told the damn news that, here it is.
[54:08.760 --> 54:11.640]  Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for one minute.
[54:11.640 --> 54:12.880]  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[54:12.880 --> 54:15.420]  Our Constitution is clear.
[54:15.420 --> 54:18.440]  The President is the Commander-in-Chief.
[54:18.440 --> 54:23.920]  Side-stepping the President and violating the chain of command is a grave crime.
[54:23.920 --> 54:28.400]  According to Bob Woodward's book, Parallel, General Mark Milley directed senior military
[54:28.400 --> 54:34.920]  officials not to follow the President's orders unless General Milley approved them first.
[54:34.920 --> 54:38.520]  When I asked General Milley about Parallel at an armed services hearing, he claimed he
[54:38.520 --> 54:40.240]  hadn't read it.
[54:40.240 --> 54:45.980]  So Senator Chuck Grassley and I sent a letter to General Milley asking him to verify or
[54:45.980 --> 54:48.680]  refute the book's claims.
[54:48.680 --> 54:50.800]  He hasn't responded.
[54:50.800 --> 54:55.440]  Why I'm calling on General Milley to set the record straight, General Milley is accused
[54:55.440 --> 55:00.000]  of secretly seizing the President's military powers.
[55:00.000 --> 55:03.140]  That is the most serious crime.
[55:03.140 --> 55:07.000]  If he is innocent, he has a duty to say so.
[55:07.000 --> 55:08.000]  Thank you.
[55:08.000 --> 55:09.000]  I yield back.
[55:09.000 --> 55:10.000]  OK, now that's him talking about it.
[55:10.000 --> 55:15.800]  We have Grassley actually interrogating Milley, but that's 10 minutes long, 10 minutes 29
[55:15.800 --> 55:16.800]  seconds long.
[55:16.800 --> 55:20.880]  Grassley is in civilian control of the military and General Mark Milley.
[55:20.880 --> 55:26.320]  But the issue here is, you're like, well, wait a minute, they were trying to take power
[55:26.320 --> 55:27.320]  for the President.
[55:27.320 --> 55:30.920]  Well, now because they control the President, they're trying to give dictatorial power to
[55:30.920 --> 55:36.600]  the President and trying to retroactively set all this up.
[55:36.600 --> 55:41.200]  So it's hitting the news, it's coming out, but the point is they're trying to have a
[55:41.200 --> 55:45.000]  soft coup right now ahead of the collapse, the new lockdowns, all of it, we're going
[55:45.000 --> 55:46.000]  to cover it.
[55:46.000 --> 55:47.800]  Now, let me talk about something right now.
[55:47.800 --> 55:54.240]  We're in a very serious world, a very crazy place, and I appreciate the listeners keeping
[55:54.240 --> 55:57.680]  us on air over the years, and for so many years we've been nipping talk with the attacks
[55:57.680 --> 56:01.120]  and the lawsuits and the globalists and all of it, but we're on air during the most important
[56:01.120 --> 56:03.800]  point in our operations history.

[57:49.480 --> 57:54.760]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left, it can be very stressful dealing
[57:54.760 --> 58:00.360]  with facts you refuse to accept, if you have a family member suffering from this degenerative
[58:00.360 --> 58:06.640]  mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarstore.com, studies have
[58:06.640 --> 58:12.600]  suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease
[58:12.600 --> 58:18.200]  triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction
[58:18.200 --> 58:24.640]  in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system, recent studies have suggested
[58:24.640 --> 58:31.760]  that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[58:31.760 --> 58:37.920]  and activity of immune cells, it worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and
[58:37.920 --> 58:44.280]  calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality, get your ultimate fish oil for
[58:44.280 --> 59:14.240]  a friend, family member, or yourself at infowarstore.com.
[59:15.720 --> 59:21.360]  The new film, the seminal film, the most important documentary ever made in my view, 2000 mules

[59:44.000 --> 59:52.440]  take action, infowarstore.com, 2000 mules.
[59:52.440 --> 1:00:00.720]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:00:00.720 --> 1:00:06.800]  American Providence is careening off the rails as it is diverted by a spineless tax money
[1:00:06.800 --> 1:00:10.600]  pit salesman from California known as Adam Schiff.
[1:00:10.600 --> 1:00:15.640]  You might think it's okay that the president is reported to have helped dictate that lie,
[1:00:15.640 --> 1:00:18.040]  you might think that's okay, I don't.
[1:00:18.040 --> 1:00:23.720]  As the Washington Times reported, Representative Adam Schiff wants a defense policy bill to
[1:00:23.720 --> 1:00:29.240]  include language blocking Congress from oversight of the military and national guard in some
[1:00:29.240 --> 1:00:31.360]  cases of domestic deployment.
[1:00:31.360 --> 1:00:37.240]  The exemption from congressional oversight is narrowly focused on the deployment of troops,
[1:00:37.240 --> 1:00:43.160]  but Mr. Schiff's free pass for the Pentagon could impact a range of oversight from border
[1:00:43.160 --> 1:00:46.960]  security to the January riot at the U.S. Capitol.
[1:00:46.960 --> 1:00:53.280]  The U.S. military is not allowed to be involved in any way, even the most minor way involved
[1:00:53.280 --> 1:00:54.760]  in domestic politics.
[1:00:54.760 --> 1:00:59.760]  So this suggests the U.S. military and Joe Biden is involved in domestic politics.
[1:00:59.760 --> 1:01:05.240]  Well we also know Tucker from reporting by Newsweek that said that military assets were
[1:01:05.240 --> 1:01:10.880]  involved in January 6th, even leading up to the events of January 6th.
[1:01:10.880 --> 1:01:13.040]  What was the military doing?
[1:01:13.040 --> 1:01:18.560]  And we know that the military was fully hostile to Donald Trump, his own military leaders
[1:01:18.560 --> 1:01:24.000]  including Mark Milley were completely hostile to the president at that point.
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:29.760]  Ray Epps, not Jacob Chansley or Joe Biggs, should be the poster boy for the supposed
[1:01:29.760 --> 1:01:32.000]  insurrection on January 6th.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:38.360]  As Revolver News reported, Ray Epps has turned out to be perhaps the only person nailed dead
[1:01:38.360 --> 1:01:43.600]  to rights confessing on camera to plotting a pre-planned attack on the Capitol.
[1:01:43.600 --> 1:01:50.360]  On both January 5th and January 6th, Epps announced multiple times at multiple locations
[1:01:50.360 --> 1:02:07.960]  his upcoming plot to breach the U.S. Capitol.
[1:02:07.960 --> 1:02:12.840]  He then spent millions attempting to recruit hundreds of others to join him.
[1:02:12.840 --> 1:02:18.520]  On top of it all, Epps was seen leading key people and managing key aspects of the initial
[1:02:18.520 --> 1:02:39.520]  breach of the Capitol grounds himself.
[1:02:39.520 --> 1:02:55.360]  During the fog of war of the events following January 6th, Ray Epps and the actors surrounding
[1:02:55.360 --> 1:02:58.480]  him were hunted by the FBI in the New York Times.
[1:02:58.480 --> 1:03:04.000]  Now Epps isn't even mentioned during SHIFTS January 6th committee hearings, and now the
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:10.360]  New York Times has painted Epps as a victim of conspiracy theory, creating its own conspiracy
[1:03:10.360 --> 1:03:11.360]  theory.
[1:03:11.360 --> 1:03:16.000]  The piece describes Ray Epps as a disappointed Trump supporter.
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:18.080]  Well, here's the only thing.
[1:03:18.080 --> 1:03:21.840]  Ray Epps, as far as we know, did not go to the speech.
[1:03:21.840 --> 1:03:28.240]  Here is the alleged Trump supporter, Ray Epps, who traveled all the way from Arizona to
[1:03:28.240 --> 1:03:32.880]  Washington, D.C. and doesn't even attend the speech.
[1:03:32.880 --> 1:03:39.640]  Meanwhile, 69-year-old grandmother Pam Hemphill from Idaho, who suffers from breast cancer
[1:03:39.640 --> 1:03:58.920]  and has no criminal history, just began her 60-day sentence.
[1:03:58.920 --> 1:04:03.720]  Your government wants you to know it hates you as they cover up further evidence.
[1:04:03.720 --> 1:04:09.640]  According to the Intercept, the Secret Service erased text messages from January 5th and
[1:04:09.640 --> 1:04:16.720]  January 6th, 2021, though the Secret Service maintains that the text messages were lost
[1:04:16.720 --> 1:04:20.480]  as a result of a device replacement program.
[1:04:20.480 --> 1:04:26.000]  The letter to the Intercept says the erasure took place shortly after oversight officials
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:29.840]  requested the agency's electronic communications.
[1:04:29.840 --> 1:04:35.040]  The United States wasn't forged by bug-eyed corporate prostitutes.
[1:04:35.040 --> 1:04:41.560]  The revolutionary fortitude of the invigorating human spirit imbued in the Declaration of
[1:04:41.560 --> 1:04:48.280]  Independence are alien concepts to those who would twist the very character of our nation
[1:04:48.280 --> 1:04:54.800]  to fulfill the half-baked whims of their foreign, globalist masters and their dwindling party.
[1:04:54.800 --> 1:04:56.800]  John Bowne reporting.
[1:06:06.800 --> 1:06:13.800]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:06:13.800 --> 1:06:18.800]  And Sunday Live is 6 a.m. most of all in Troyer, only six minutes of ad breaks an hour.
[1:06:18.800 --> 1:06:22.800]  Only for our local radio and TV stations we cut all our network ads during that.
[1:06:22.800 --> 1:06:24.800]  The plan is down the road to do that with all the shows.
[1:06:24.800 --> 1:06:26.800]  We're still on over 400 radio affiliates now.
[1:06:26.800 --> 1:06:28.800]  A lot of these stations picking us up.
[1:06:28.800 --> 1:06:30.800]  And that's the format that they're basically based on.
[1:06:30.800 --> 1:06:33.800]  We're breaking the biggest news in our history here.
[1:06:33.800 --> 1:06:35.800]  We have an example of this.
[1:06:35.800 --> 1:06:39.800]  I never tell Owen Troyer what to cover or what to talk about.
[1:06:39.800 --> 1:06:42.800]  I just saw him during the break.
[1:06:42.800 --> 1:06:44.800]  He's getting ready in his office.
[1:06:44.800 --> 1:06:46.800]  I cornered him.
[1:06:46.800 --> 1:06:48.800]  And I said, this is the biggest news ever.
[1:06:48.800 --> 1:06:49.800]  Now you've got to guest in.
[1:06:49.800 --> 1:06:50.800]  It's going to be great.
[1:06:50.800 --> 1:06:52.800]  I want you to hammer this.
[1:06:52.800 --> 1:06:54.800]  He says, absolutely, we're already on it.
[1:06:54.800 --> 1:06:57.800]  So I hire people because I know they're smart and I love them and they got great instincts.
[1:06:57.800 --> 1:06:59.800]  And I just turn them loose.
[1:06:59.800 --> 1:07:05.800]  But for me to go corner one of our hosts and say, you will cover this, shows you how big this is.
[1:07:05.800 --> 1:07:10.800]  He's like, yeah, we're already on it.
[1:07:10.800 --> 1:07:12.800]  There's a lot of pieces to this.
[1:07:12.800 --> 1:07:19.800]  They were already after Trump got into office, they left stay behind networks or the bureaucracy in the deep state
[1:07:19.800 --> 1:07:22.800]  and they did not follow what Trump said and undermine things.
[1:07:22.800 --> 1:07:24.800]  And we chose the legislation, how they did it.
[1:07:24.800 --> 1:07:26.800]  I got memos to Trump, warned him.
[1:07:26.800 --> 1:07:28.800]  It's why they went crazy in 2017.
[1:07:28.800 --> 1:07:31.800]  Came after me because I was talking to Trump on a routine basis.
[1:07:31.800 --> 1:07:32.800]  He had good people around him.
[1:07:32.800 --> 1:07:37.800]  We were getting, I had law firms writing him breakdowns of how Obama kept people behind,
[1:07:37.800 --> 1:07:39.800]  how they stayed in the government.
[1:07:39.800 --> 1:07:43.800]  You know, they had died at Flynn trying to stop it.
[1:07:43.800 --> 1:07:48.800]  So as an American citizen, I was doing everything I could having a connection to the POTUS to do that.
[1:07:48.800 --> 1:07:51.800]  And I don't bring that up to insert myself in the story.
[1:07:51.800 --> 1:07:53.800]  I'm just saying we knew this was there.
[1:07:53.800 --> 1:07:54.800]  So this was going on.
[1:07:54.800 --> 1:07:56.800]  And then that group stayed in power.
[1:07:56.800 --> 1:07:58.800]  Trump got some of his people in.
[1:07:58.800 --> 1:08:02.800]  But the last few months, almost everybody resigned under threats or looking for new jobs,
[1:08:02.800 --> 1:08:06.800]  even if they were quote conservative, most of them were opportunists looking for the next job.
[1:08:06.800 --> 1:08:08.800]  That's how the average person works.
[1:08:08.800 --> 1:08:15.800]  And so by the last month of Trump's administration, he was down like four or five aides.
[1:08:15.800 --> 1:08:19.800]  And the few lawyers and people that were there were globalist,
[1:08:19.800 --> 1:08:26.800]  other than like Rudolph Giuliani and Flynn coming there and a few others.
[1:08:26.800 --> 1:08:28.800]  And so they maneuvered January 6th.
[1:08:28.800 --> 1:08:31.800]  They had the military stand down that Trump asked for.
[1:08:31.800 --> 1:08:33.800]  They staged that hoping it would be much worse.
[1:08:33.800 --> 1:08:38.800]  And so now since then, right when Biden got in through fraud in late January,
[1:08:38.800 --> 1:08:41.800]  I took a break right after the inauguration.
[1:08:41.800 --> 1:08:45.800]  I said, I'm going to take my family skiing in Utah at Park City.
[1:08:45.800 --> 1:08:47.800]  I did shows there live.
[1:08:47.800 --> 1:08:52.800]  And we covered the press conferences with Jen Psaki and the rest of them saying,
[1:08:52.800 --> 1:08:54.800]  we're going to wage war against domestic extremists.
[1:08:54.800 --> 1:08:56.800]  They're the number one threat.
[1:08:56.800 --> 1:08:58.800]  And there's going to be a big civil war with Trump supporters.
[1:08:58.800 --> 1:09:00.800]  And I said, wow, that's incredible.
[1:09:00.800 --> 1:09:05.800]  And then they started putting out in June of the next year that the main threats,
[1:09:05.800 --> 1:09:09.800]  white people and conservatives and gun owners is going to be a civil war.
[1:09:09.800 --> 1:09:10.800]  You see it everywhere.
[1:09:10.800 --> 1:09:12.800]  You don't need me to remind you of it.
[1:09:12.800 --> 1:09:14.800]  I'm like, wow, they're really planning this.
[1:09:14.800 --> 1:09:15.800]  They know they stole the election.
[1:09:15.800 --> 1:09:18.800]  They're going to try something before the midterms.
[1:09:18.800 --> 1:09:20.800]  And that was a year and a half ago.
[1:09:20.800 --> 1:09:23.800]  Now we're 114 days out.
[1:09:23.800 --> 1:09:28.800]  And then Congress starts going, hey, Millie told CNN he took control of the government last month
[1:09:28.800 --> 1:09:32.800]  and ignored Trump and told the military not follow the president's orders.
[1:09:32.800 --> 1:09:34.800]  And so Senator Grassley is talking about it.
[1:09:34.800 --> 1:09:35.800]  Others are talking about it.
[1:09:35.800 --> 1:09:42.800]  And then Adam Schiff in the omnibus spending bill that we covered last hour.
[1:09:42.800 --> 1:09:44.800]  I'll give you the number five days ago.
[1:09:44.800 --> 1:09:46.800]  It's no coverage till Friday.
[1:09:46.800 --> 1:09:47.800]  I don't even know about it.
[1:09:47.800 --> 1:09:53.800]  I finally look at the bill HR 4350.
[1:09:53.800 --> 1:09:57.800]  And it says the president is in command of the military domestically.
[1:09:57.800 --> 1:10:01.800]  They got to declare war or declare military operation overseas through Congress.
[1:10:01.800 --> 1:10:05.800]  But domestically, that's even harder to do.
[1:10:05.800 --> 1:10:11.800]  That happens as Abraham Lincoln against the American people.
[1:10:11.800 --> 1:10:15.800]  Sure, a tornado, a hurricane, a flood, whatever.
[1:10:15.800 --> 1:10:20.800]  But not those are specific missions that the president can do,
[1:10:20.800 --> 1:10:22.800]  but not outside of Congress in the funding.
[1:10:22.800 --> 1:10:24.800]  That's already funded for emergencies.
[1:10:24.800 --> 1:10:29.800]  So this is officially them hiding in plain view of the dictatorship,
[1:10:29.800 --> 1:10:33.800]  turning Biden into a dictator and saying he's in command of the military
[1:10:33.800 --> 1:10:35.800]  for domestic operations.
[1:10:35.800 --> 1:10:36.800]  I saw that Friday.
[1:10:36.800 --> 1:10:38.800]  I read the articles that this is terrible.
[1:10:38.800 --> 1:10:40.800]  It's going to be pointed to the American people.
[1:10:40.800 --> 1:10:45.800]  But I got busy because I was literally trying to raise funds for eight hours Friday.
[1:10:45.800 --> 1:10:47.800]  I was on here three hours for eight hours.
[1:10:47.800 --> 1:10:49.800]  I was just trying to keep it for us in the air.
[1:10:49.800 --> 1:10:52.800]  They've distracted me with all this stuff.
[1:10:52.800 --> 1:11:01.800]  I finally looked the bill and I have never been so blown away.
[1:11:01.800 --> 1:11:05.800]  So now we move into the most important point.
[1:11:05.800 --> 1:11:07.800]  What are you going to do?
[1:11:07.800 --> 1:11:09.800]  What am I going to do?
[1:11:09.800 --> 1:11:12.800]  Because believe me, tomorrow's weekday show.
[1:11:12.800 --> 1:11:13.800]  I'm host of the fourth hour.
[1:11:13.800 --> 1:11:14.800]  Salante's a great guy.
[1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:15.800]  We're pushing him.
[1:11:15.800 --> 1:11:17.800]  I'm doing the whole four hours.
[1:11:17.800 --> 1:11:20.800]  We're going to be taking calls from police and military.
[1:11:20.800 --> 1:11:23.800]  We're going to make this the central issue because we knew this was
[1:11:23.800 --> 1:11:25.800]  proven prepared by Clinton and Obama and others.
[1:11:25.800 --> 1:11:29.800]  We know even under Reagan without his knowledge, George Herbert Walker Bush
[1:11:29.800 --> 1:11:31.800]  had Rex 84 on a plan for this.
[1:11:31.800 --> 1:11:35.800]  Back then that was a huge scandal.
[1:11:35.800 --> 1:11:40.800]  But because it was right wingers, the left thought it was a top story and it got killed.
[1:11:40.800 --> 1:11:42.800]  It wasn't really right wingers.
[1:11:42.800 --> 1:11:48.800]  It was a leftist globalist, W.E.F., Bilderberg coup through Herbert Walker Bush.
[1:11:48.800 --> 1:11:50.800]  But we've got to expose this.
[1:11:50.800 --> 1:11:52.800]  We've got to make this the big issue.
[1:11:52.800 --> 1:11:59.800]  We've got to break our backs and break our necks.
[1:11:59.800 --> 1:12:00.800]  Getting this out.
[1:12:00.800 --> 1:12:05.800]  I mean, when I get off here today, I'm calling Joe Rogan.
[1:12:05.800 --> 1:12:09.800]  And I'm telling him, because I never tell him about politics or try to make him do stuff,
[1:12:09.800 --> 1:12:13.800]  because he's pig-headed not, but no, in 25 years.
[1:12:13.800 --> 1:12:16.800]  But I'm going to tell him, this is making a break.
[1:12:16.800 --> 1:12:20.800]  You're going to look at these documents and you're going to respond to this.
[1:12:20.800 --> 1:12:22.800]  And I'm going to call Tucker Carlson.
[1:12:22.800 --> 1:12:23.800]  And I'm going to call members of Congress.
[1:12:23.800 --> 1:12:24.800]  I got their numbers.
[1:12:24.800 --> 1:12:26.800]  I'm going to be up till midnight.
[1:12:26.800 --> 1:12:29.800]  You better bet your bottom shilling.
[1:12:29.800 --> 1:12:31.800]  Your bottom kroner.
[1:12:31.800 --> 1:12:32.800]  Your bottom dollar.
[1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:33.800]  Your bottom ruble.
[1:12:33.800 --> 1:12:39.800]  You better bet your ass that I know this is it.
[1:12:39.800 --> 1:12:42.800]  There's, intellectually, I know it is.
[1:12:42.800 --> 1:12:43.800]  Historically, I know it is.
[1:12:43.800 --> 1:12:47.800]  But spiritually, I'm like a flamethrower right now.
[1:12:47.800 --> 1:12:52.800]  I mean, this is it.
[1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:53.800]  We have the history.
[1:12:53.800 --> 1:12:54.800]  We have the legislation.
[1:12:54.800 --> 1:12:56.800]  We have the fact that it's already in place.
[1:12:56.800 --> 1:12:57.800]  They're trying to retroactively legalize it.
[1:12:57.800 --> 1:13:04.800]  And then we have the question, how do we stop it?
[1:13:04.800 --> 1:13:10.800]  And the backdrop of martial law and collapse and open borders and currency evaluation.
[1:13:10.800 --> 1:13:16.800]  I've just blown away that we are on air despite all their efforts, thanks to you in the year.
[1:13:16.800 --> 1:13:23.800]  2022 on July 17th, covering this despite everything the enemies of humanity have done.
[1:13:23.800 --> 1:13:27.800]  And I just, I got to salute you because I want to stand to fight.
[1:13:27.800 --> 1:13:31.800]  I am not the toughest guy around.
[1:13:31.800 --> 1:13:33.800]  I've had my leg.
[1:13:33.800 --> 1:13:34.800]  I was young, man.
[1:13:34.800 --> 1:13:35.800]  It's always hard to fight.
[1:13:35.800 --> 1:13:36.800]  They got to fight.
[1:13:36.800 --> 1:13:40.800]  But I've had my ass kicked, but unfortunately, most of the time, it wasn't the other way around.
[1:13:40.800 --> 1:13:41.800]  They got hurt real bad.
[1:13:41.800 --> 1:13:44.800]  I'm not proud of that, but I'm like a pit bull.
[1:13:44.800 --> 1:13:47.800]  Once I get in a fight, man, I'm not thinking about how I'm getting bit.
[1:13:47.800 --> 1:13:49.800]  I want to win.
[1:13:49.800 --> 1:13:50.800]  I want to stop them.
[1:13:50.800 --> 1:13:51.800]  I'm biting.
[1:13:51.800 --> 1:13:52.800]  I'm snapping.
[1:13:52.800 --> 1:13:53.800]  I'm grabbing.
[1:13:53.800 --> 1:14:00.800]  I'm giving it everything I got with my big pit bull jaws.
[1:14:00.800 --> 1:14:03.800]  I just want to thank you for keeping us in the fight.
[1:14:03.800 --> 1:14:09.800]  It's a success that as bad as things are, we're still in the fight in the year 2022.
[1:14:09.800 --> 1:14:11.800]  Thank you so much listeners.
[1:14:11.800 --> 1:14:16.800]  Thank you so much viewers because that's all I want to do is stay in this fight, but you
[1:14:16.800 --> 1:14:24.800]  are literally my heart and my mind and my blood and my bones and my muscles and my guts.
[1:14:24.800 --> 1:14:29.800]  You are literally keeping me at point blank range attacking these people.
[1:14:29.800 --> 1:14:32.800]  And that's where I want to be because let me give you the goodness.
[1:14:32.800 --> 1:14:40.800]  I've calculated every possible outcome of this and in about 90% of the outcomes we win.
[1:14:40.800 --> 1:14:44.800]  And those are all probable, but it's going to be hell on the way.
[1:14:44.800 --> 1:14:47.800]  Just like Churchill told people to start a world war two.
[1:14:47.800 --> 1:14:49.800]  He said, listen, I ain't here today.
[1:14:49.800 --> 1:14:52.800]  It's going to be easy, but we're not rolling over and we're going to win.
[1:14:52.800 --> 1:15:00.800]  It's going to be hard.
[1:15:00.800 --> 1:15:03.800]  It's going to be hard folks.
[1:15:03.800 --> 1:15:05.800]  And we've already set up operations against them.
[1:15:05.800 --> 1:15:07.800]  We've already exposed them so bad.
[1:15:07.800 --> 1:15:09.800]  All our past work is like money in the bank.
[1:15:09.800 --> 1:15:14.800]  It's already, I can get killed tomorrow or put in prison or whatever.
[1:15:14.800 --> 1:15:16.800]  We already fucked them up.
[1:15:16.800 --> 1:15:18.800]  We fucked them hard.
[1:15:18.800 --> 1:15:19.800]  We fucked them hard.
[1:15:19.800 --> 1:15:21.800]  Fuck you, New World Order.
[1:15:21.800 --> 1:15:24.800]  We fucked you.
[1:15:24.800 --> 1:15:27.800]  But I want to keep on winning.
[1:15:27.800 --> 1:15:31.800]  And I think and I know my best work is about to be done.
[1:15:31.800 --> 1:15:35.800]  So I'm asking you now to pray to God for a global awakening.
[1:15:35.800 --> 1:15:40.800]  And I'm asking you now to use your will against these people and to peacefully speak out against them
[1:15:40.800 --> 1:15:46.800]  and to have this information go everywhere.
[1:15:46.800 --> 1:15:47.800]  They know they've already lost.
[1:15:47.800 --> 1:15:49.800]  They want to blow stuff up before they leave.
[1:15:49.800 --> 1:15:50.800]  How do we stop them?
[1:15:50.800 --> 1:15:51.800]  How do we expose this?
[1:15:51.800 --> 1:15:52.800]  And it's already happening.
[1:15:52.800 --> 1:15:54.800]  This is toe to toe with Satan.
[1:15:54.800 --> 1:15:56.800]  Stay with us.
[1:15:56.800 --> 1:16:01.800]  Jacob in Ohio.
[1:16:01.800 --> 1:16:02.800]  Welcome.
[1:16:02.800 --> 1:16:03.800]  Go ahead.
[1:16:03.800 --> 1:16:04.800]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[1:16:04.800 --> 1:16:05.800]  Good, bro.
[1:16:05.800 --> 1:16:06.800]  Great last caller.
[1:16:06.800 --> 1:16:08.800]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[1:16:08.800 --> 1:16:14.800]  It's basically the only way I get to sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, moralization, and absurdity.
[1:16:14.800 --> 1:16:16.800]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone, man.
[1:16:16.800 --> 1:16:17.800]  All right.
[1:16:17.800 --> 1:16:18.800]  Eric in New Hampshire.
[1:16:18.800 --> 1:16:19.800]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[1:16:19.800 --> 1:16:20.800]  Go ahead.
[1:16:20.800 --> 1:16:21.800]  Hey, Alex.
[1:16:21.800 --> 1:16:22.800]  Thanks for taking my call.
[1:16:22.800 --> 1:16:24.800]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the phone of the product.
[1:16:24.800 --> 1:16:26.800]  Who does wonders?
[1:16:26.800 --> 1:16:27.800]  I recommend it to everybody.
[1:16:27.800 --> 1:16:28.800]  You're on the fence about it.
[1:16:28.800 --> 1:16:29.800]  Get off the fence.
[1:16:29.800 --> 1:16:30.800]  Get the product.
[1:16:30.800 --> 1:16:31.800]  Support the import.
[1:16:31.800 --> 1:16:32.800]  Tyler in Maine.
[1:16:32.800 --> 1:16:33.800]  You're on the air.
[1:16:33.800 --> 1:16:34.800]  Thanks for rolling.
[1:16:34.800 --> 1:16:35.800]  Go ahead.
[1:16:35.800 --> 1:16:36.800]  Hey, Alex.
[1:16:36.800 --> 1:16:37.800]  It's great to be on with you.
[1:16:37.800 --> 1:16:38.800]  It's an honor.
[1:16:38.800 --> 1:16:39.800]  Honor, talk to you.
[1:16:39.800 --> 1:16:40.800]  Awesome.
[1:16:40.800 --> 1:16:41.800]  So, firstly, I wanted to do is say I love the product.
[1:16:41.800 --> 1:16:43.800]  Alpha Power, even at 29.
[1:16:43.800 --> 1:16:45.800]  If you ask my better half, she loves it.
[1:16:45.800 --> 1:16:47.800]  And it helps in the bedroom.
[1:16:47.800 --> 1:16:49.800]  So, just number one for a few of you.
[1:16:49.800 --> 1:16:50.800]  It definitely works.
[1:16:50.800 --> 1:16:51.800]  It's not a joke.
[1:16:51.800 --> 1:16:58.800]  Absolutely.
[1:17:39.800 --> 1:17:42.800]  The only way you fail is not visiting preparedtoday.com.
[1:17:42.800 --> 1:17:45.800]  There's not a question now whether you need this or not.
[1:17:45.800 --> 1:17:46.800]  You need it.
[1:17:46.800 --> 1:17:48.800]  Before, it was just a backup plan and insurance.
[1:17:48.800 --> 1:17:49.800]  This is an insurance.
[1:17:49.800 --> 1:17:50.800]  This is survival.
[1:17:50.800 --> 1:17:51.800]  Preparetoday.com.
[1:17:51.800 --> 1:17:52.800]  Preparetoday.com.
[1:17:52.800 --> 1:17:57.800]  And I'll see you there.
[1:17:57.800 --> 1:18:03.800]  Seven months ago, in December of 2021, we launched the first in the three-coin founding member
[1:18:03.800 --> 1:18:06.800]  series, George Washington slaying the dragon.
[1:18:06.800 --> 1:18:08.800]  Then, we launched the Tree of Liberty coin.
[1:18:08.800 --> 1:18:12.800]  And finally, the second amendment, come and take it, Molan Lobby coin.
[1:18:12.800 --> 1:18:18.800]  There are only 75 coins left in the three-point series.
[1:18:18.800 --> 1:18:22.800]  And, of course, right now, at 1776point.com.
[1:18:22.800 --> 1:18:27.800]  And for the final 75 people to become founding members for this big project we're launching
[1:18:27.800 --> 1:18:33.800]  in the near future, you'll also get a personal signed piece of art I made of the sheepdog
[1:18:33.800 --> 1:18:35.800]  chasing the wolf in a personal message.
[1:18:35.800 --> 1:18:41.800]  It's your last chance to get all three coins at 1776point.com.
[1:18:41.800 --> 1:18:43.800]  This is history happening now.
[1:18:43.800 --> 1:18:50.800]  Info, workstation, support is changing the world, and this is the final 75 three-coin
[1:18:50.800 --> 1:18:57.800]  set exclusively available at 1776point.com.

[1:20:21.800 --> 1:20:22.800]  All right.
[1:20:22.800 --> 1:20:26.800]  Owen Schreuer in 40 minutes is going to take over with Sunday Live.
[1:20:26.800 --> 1:20:28.800]  We'll be covering all this in great detail.
[1:20:28.800 --> 1:20:32.800]  I didn't want to cancel Alex Stein because he's a friend of mine.
[1:20:32.800 --> 1:20:33.800]  He's a smart guy.
[1:20:33.800 --> 1:20:34.800]  He's a patriot.
[1:20:34.800 --> 1:20:38.800]  And he's also done a lot of great satire and comedy to expose the globalist.
[1:20:38.800 --> 1:20:41.800]  He was coming on today to talk about his big exploits with AOC and everything.
[1:20:41.800 --> 1:20:44.800]  It's got 20, 30 million views last time I checked.
[1:20:44.800 --> 1:20:46.800]  I mean, everything he's doing is just on fire right now.
[1:20:46.800 --> 1:20:49.800]  He's breaking through the matrix. He's having a huge effect.
[1:20:49.800 --> 1:20:50.800]  But he's also a serious person.
[1:20:50.800 --> 1:20:55.800]  His mother got killed by the COVID medical tyranny and the rest of it.
[1:20:55.800 --> 1:20:58.800]  And before he leaves, we'll get to some of the latest clips and the rest of it.
[1:20:58.800 --> 1:21:04.800]  But I want the serious Alex Stein with us, who he's been on the show this before being serious,
[1:21:04.800 --> 1:21:10.800]  to just give your response to the attempt at martial law introduced as legislation in the
[1:21:10.800 --> 1:21:17.800]  omnibus spending bill right now saying the president's a dictator to use the military against right-wing extremists.
[1:21:17.800 --> 1:21:22.800]  I mean, this is incredible that this happened five, six days ago.
[1:21:22.800 --> 1:21:24.800]  I didn't learn about it till Friday.
[1:21:24.800 --> 1:21:25.800]  Didn't read the bill till today.
[1:21:25.800 --> 1:21:31.800]  I mean, we are living in incredibly dangerous times, Alex Stein.
[1:21:31.800 --> 1:21:32.800]  Yeah, Alex.
[1:21:32.800 --> 1:21:36.800]  I mean, the National Defense Authorization Act, I mean, it gives the military way too much power.
[1:21:36.800 --> 1:21:40.800]  And as a matter of fact, you have guys like Dan Crenshaw, who we know is a globalist,
[1:21:40.800 --> 1:21:45.800]  creating a recent Twitter thread, defending it, saying that it doesn't actually kick out
[1:21:45.800 --> 1:21:47.800]  service members for not having the vaccine.
[1:21:47.800 --> 1:21:50.800]  But what it does is it creates a uniformity.
[1:21:50.800 --> 1:21:53.800]  It creates rules for how to kick them out.
[1:21:53.800 --> 1:21:58.800]  So you and I both know that these politicians are as crooked as a dog's hind leg.
[1:21:58.800 --> 1:22:02.800]  So when they authorize something like this, it's very similar to the Patriot Act.
[1:22:02.800 --> 1:22:07.800]  You and I probably will not feel it for the next one or two years, but 10 years down the road,
[1:22:07.800 --> 1:22:09.800]  it's going to take away all the power from the people.
[1:22:09.800 --> 1:22:12.800]  And this is actually a big nightmare in my opinion, Alex.
[1:22:12.800 --> 1:22:15.800]  Well, I hear you, but I don't know this is going to be 10 years from now.
[1:22:15.800 --> 1:22:17.800]  We're 114 days after the midterms.
[1:22:17.800 --> 1:22:24.800]  And I mean, even members of Congress say this makes the military a dictatorship under the president.
[1:22:24.800 --> 1:22:27.800]  What do you think is about to unfold?
[1:22:27.800 --> 1:22:28.800]  Well, no, you're 100% right.
[1:22:28.800 --> 1:22:29.800]  I mean, it can happen faster.
[1:22:29.800 --> 1:22:34.800]  But I'm hoping and praying that we get some sort of Republican president in there in two years
[1:22:34.800 --> 1:22:39.800]  and that this doesn't become the standard operating procedure where the military can dictate our freedom.
[1:22:39.800 --> 1:22:44.800]  But listen, you and I both know that you can't worry about the things you can't control.
[1:22:44.800 --> 1:22:45.800]  I've lost my mother.
[1:22:45.800 --> 1:22:50.800]  I've had a terrible time with all the COVID protocols over the last few years.
[1:22:50.800 --> 1:22:52.800]  It's actually ruined my life.
[1:22:52.800 --> 1:22:55.800]  So my point being is that we've already run by NGOs.
[1:22:55.800 --> 1:22:57.800]  We're already run by multinational corporations.
[1:22:57.800 --> 1:22:59.800]  So what the people need to do is totally agree.
[1:22:59.800 --> 1:23:01.800]  We're already under the globalist dictatorship.
[1:23:01.800 --> 1:23:03.800]  They're just trying to make it formal now.
[1:23:03.800 --> 1:23:04.800]  Yeah, 100%.
[1:23:04.800 --> 1:23:07.800]  But my point being is obviously we have to stand up and fight back.
[1:23:07.800 --> 1:23:08.800]  There's no question about it.
[1:23:08.800 --> 1:23:12.800]  But by letting them control our lives, control our happiness, that's what they want.
[1:23:12.800 --> 1:23:13.800]  They want us to live in fear.
[1:23:13.800 --> 1:23:16.800]  So when we have something like this and it pops up and it gets passed,
[1:23:16.800 --> 1:23:19.800]  we cannot immediately just go into fight or flight mode.
[1:23:19.800 --> 1:23:20.800]  That's exactly what they want.
[1:23:20.800 --> 1:23:22.800]  Well, we have to agree with you, but I want to get people up.
[1:23:22.800 --> 1:23:24.800]  There's a paradox.
[1:23:24.800 --> 1:23:26.800]  You don't want to get too upset about it.
[1:23:26.800 --> 1:23:30.800]  You want to get upset about it and stop it from being mainlined.
[1:23:30.800 --> 1:23:31.800]  No, 100%.
[1:23:31.800 --> 1:23:33.800]  But I mean, how are we going to fight back?
[1:23:33.800 --> 1:23:34.800]  We've got to get voted.
[1:23:34.800 --> 1:23:35.800]  I mean, it's a long process.
[1:23:35.800 --> 1:23:37.800]  We've got to have Marjorie Taylor-Greens.
[1:23:37.800 --> 1:23:39.800]  We've got to have a few politicians that actually have our back.
[1:23:39.800 --> 1:23:40.800]  But the problem is,
[1:23:40.800 --> 1:23:42.800]  globalists have been running this country for a long time.
[1:23:42.800 --> 1:23:45.800]  Not 11 was not, I mean, nearly 20 years ago.
[1:23:45.800 --> 1:23:49.800]  But the effects of it, we're still feeling today.
[1:23:49.800 --> 1:23:51.800]  So we can't even go back and fix that, Alex.
[1:23:51.800 --> 1:23:53.800]  So my point being is that we're seeing this.
[1:23:53.800 --> 1:23:54.800]  It's right in front of our face.
[1:23:54.800 --> 1:23:56.800]  What they want to do is they want to control us.
[1:23:56.800 --> 1:23:59.800]  The government is a people control mechanism.
[1:23:59.800 --> 1:24:02.800]  So we have to take back the control by being civility disobedient.
[1:24:02.800 --> 1:24:03.800]  That's the only way.
[1:24:03.800 --> 1:24:05.800]  No, I totally agree that they're doing this because they're weak.
[1:24:05.800 --> 1:24:06.800]  They're not strong.
[1:24:06.800 --> 1:24:08.800]  The military can't win a war against America.
[1:24:08.800 --> 1:24:10.800]  People couldn't win a war against the Vietnamese,
[1:24:10.800 --> 1:24:13.800]  but we have to admit they're at least trying it.
[1:24:13.800 --> 1:24:14.800]  I see this.
[1:24:14.800 --> 1:24:16.800]  I agree with you as a major sign of weakness.
[1:24:16.800 --> 1:24:18.800]  Let's talk about you being positive, being funny,
[1:24:18.800 --> 1:24:20.800]  and going super viral.
[1:24:20.800 --> 1:24:22.800]  They really don't like being laughed at.
[1:24:22.800 --> 1:24:23.800]  No, they really don't.
[1:24:23.800 --> 1:24:25.800]  They take themselves so serious.
[1:24:25.800 --> 1:24:29.800]  And you look at AOC, you know, obviously I sexualized her on purpose.
[1:24:29.800 --> 1:24:30.800]  That was my plan.
[1:24:30.800 --> 1:24:31.800]  I talked about it on your show.
[1:24:31.800 --> 1:24:34.800]  I talked about it on multiple shows saying that they always want to play the victim.
[1:24:34.800 --> 1:24:37.800]  They say AOC says, oh, everybody wants to date her.
[1:24:37.800 --> 1:24:40.800]  Well, listen, I'm going to give you concrete evidence of somebody sexualizing you
[1:24:40.800 --> 1:24:41.800]  and wanting to date you.
[1:24:41.800 --> 1:24:42.800]  And what did she do?
[1:24:42.800 --> 1:24:43.800]  She freaked out.
[1:24:43.800 --> 1:24:46.800]  When I called Dan Crenshaw, I patch became he freaked out because these politicians,
[1:24:46.800 --> 1:24:50.800]  they cannot stand to be mocked when they go to their local fundraising events.
[1:24:50.800 --> 1:24:53.800]  All they do is get their dairy air kiss.
[1:24:53.800 --> 1:24:55.800]  So as soon as we get in their face and we make them uncomfortable,
[1:24:55.800 --> 1:24:59.800]  just like AOC tweeted, we should do, it makes them melt down.
[1:24:59.800 --> 1:25:01.800]  Because all of these people are cowards.
[1:25:01.800 --> 1:25:05.800]  They're all bought and sold by corporations that don't care about us.
[1:25:05.800 --> 1:25:06.800]  They don't have the ability.
[1:25:06.800 --> 1:25:09.800]  They say go to Supreme Court people's houses and threaten them.
[1:25:09.800 --> 1:25:12.800]  They say confront people at grocery stores and gas stations.
[1:25:12.800 --> 1:25:14.800]  And all you say is, man, you're gorgeous, baby.
[1:25:14.800 --> 1:25:16.800]  And she tries to get in the fist fight with you.
[1:25:16.800 --> 1:25:18.800]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of AOC.
[1:25:18.800 --> 1:25:19.800]  Here it is.
[1:25:19.800 --> 1:25:21.800]  Hey, thanks for video kissing me.
[1:25:21.800 --> 1:25:24.800]  AOC, my favorite big booty Latina.
[1:25:24.800 --> 1:25:25.800]  I love you, AOC.
[1:25:25.800 --> 1:25:26.800]  You're my favorite.
[1:25:26.800 --> 1:25:29.800]  She wants to kill babies, but she's still beautiful.
[1:25:29.800 --> 1:25:31.800]  You look very beautiful in that dress.
[1:25:31.800 --> 1:25:32.800]  You look very sexy.
[1:25:32.800 --> 1:25:34.800]  Look at that booty on AOC.
[1:25:34.800 --> 1:25:36.800]  That's my favorite big booty Latina.
[1:25:36.800 --> 1:25:37.800]  Watch it with a little selfie.
[1:25:37.800 --> 1:25:38.800]  I love it.
[1:25:38.800 --> 1:25:39.800]  My favorite AOC.
[1:25:39.800 --> 1:25:40.800]  Nice to meet you, AOC.
[1:25:40.800 --> 1:25:42.800]  Look how sexy she looks in that dress.
[1:25:42.800 --> 1:25:45.800]  Ooh, I love it, AOC.
[1:25:45.800 --> 1:25:47.800]  Hot, hot, hot like a tamale.
[1:25:47.800 --> 1:25:49.800]  And then tell us what happened.
[1:25:49.800 --> 1:25:51.800]  I mean, I saw it, but she went out and claimed
[1:25:51.800 --> 1:25:53.800]  she was attacked, threatened, whatever.
[1:25:53.800 --> 1:25:54.800]  Oh, yeah.
[1:25:54.800 --> 1:25:55.800]  She was sexually harassed.
[1:25:55.800 --> 1:25:56.800]  So at first she didn't know who I was.
[1:25:56.800 --> 1:25:58.800]  She sent a staffer down to come take a picture.
[1:25:58.800 --> 1:25:59.800]  And she tweeted my picture.
[1:25:59.800 --> 1:26:00.800]  And in the picture, I'm smiling.
[1:26:00.800 --> 1:26:02.800]  I hand the staffer a business card.
[1:26:02.800 --> 1:26:03.800]  I sent him Alex Dine.
[1:26:03.800 --> 1:26:04.800]  I'm a Blaze TV contributor.
[1:26:04.800 --> 1:26:06.800]  I'm a, you know, this is kind of what I do.
[1:26:06.800 --> 1:26:08.800]  Then once I handed him a business card,
[1:26:08.800 --> 1:26:10.800]  the staffer, and they took a picture.
[1:26:10.800 --> 1:26:11.800]  That's when all hell broke loose.
[1:26:11.800 --> 1:26:13.800]  She was supposed to go in and vote for a bill.
[1:26:13.800 --> 1:26:14.800]  You see she's wearing her mask right there.
[1:26:14.800 --> 1:26:15.800]  She immediately took off her mask.
[1:26:15.800 --> 1:26:17.800]  She's up there on the steps of the Capitol,
[1:26:17.800 --> 1:26:19.800]  the very top coming in a reverse selfie mode.
[1:26:19.800 --> 1:26:21.800]  She's about 10 Instagram posts.
[1:26:21.800 --> 1:26:23.800]  Literally Alex, she makes, I mean,
[1:26:23.800 --> 1:26:25.800]  about 10 posts talking about it,
[1:26:25.800 --> 1:26:27.800]  saying she's a victim because that's what they want us to be.
[1:26:27.800 --> 1:26:29.800]  Alex, they want you and I to be a victim.
[1:26:29.800 --> 1:26:30.800]  That's their mentality.
[1:26:30.800 --> 1:26:31.800]  It's the, you know, victim.
[1:26:31.800 --> 1:26:36.800]  But she went and fake cried at the empty immigrant center.
[1:26:36.800 --> 1:26:37.800]  Of course.
[1:26:37.800 --> 1:26:39.800]  And listen, AOC, you can look at her document.
[1:26:39.800 --> 1:26:41.800]  She was casted to be in that role.
[1:26:41.800 --> 1:26:42.800]  She literally was.
[1:26:42.800 --> 1:26:44.800]  I mean, they basically were looking for people in her district
[1:26:44.800 --> 1:26:46.800]  that they thought would be able to win.
[1:26:46.800 --> 1:26:47.800]  And she was casted.
[1:26:47.800 --> 1:26:48.800]  She is very pretty.
[1:26:48.800 --> 1:26:49.800]  I'll be honest.
[1:26:49.800 --> 1:26:50.800]  I didn't think she was prettier.
[1:26:50.800 --> 1:26:51.800]  Politics are absolutely garbage.
[1:26:51.800 --> 1:26:53.800]  But when you look at her in person,
[1:26:53.800 --> 1:26:54.800]  she's very petite.
[1:26:54.800 --> 1:26:55.800]  She's in great shape.
[1:26:55.800 --> 1:26:56.800]  I mean, listen, I love women.
[1:26:56.800 --> 1:26:58.800]  I would say she's an attractive woman.
[1:26:58.800 --> 1:26:59.800]  But that's neither here nor there.
[1:26:59.800 --> 1:27:01.800]  You're allowed to say that.
[1:27:01.800 --> 1:27:04.800]  I mean, drag queen convicted pedophiles come to schools
[1:27:04.800 --> 1:27:06.800]  that three year olds sit in their laps and five year olds.
[1:27:06.800 --> 1:27:09.800]  You just tell a woman she's good looking and it's, it's, it's,
[1:27:09.800 --> 1:27:10.800]  it's right.
[1:27:10.800 --> 1:27:13.800]  But Alex, this is the whole point is, is obviously they defend
[1:27:13.800 --> 1:27:14.800]  the capital police.
[1:27:14.800 --> 1:27:16.800]  I don't know if you've heard of it, but it's a little bit
[1:27:16.800 --> 1:27:18.800]  of a generalization of our children.
[1:27:18.800 --> 1:27:21.800]  But I triggered her in such a manner that she went in and voted
[1:27:21.800 --> 1:27:22.800]  for three hours.
[1:27:22.800 --> 1:27:24.800]  And when she came out, the only thing she would talk about
[1:27:24.800 --> 1:27:25.800]  was the capital police.
[1:27:25.800 --> 1:27:28.800]  And then she went and proceeded to throw the capital police
[1:27:28.800 --> 1:27:31.800]  under the bus by saying that the capital police let in the
[1:27:31.800 --> 1:27:33.800]  insurrectionists on January 6th.
[1:27:33.800 --> 1:27:36.800]  Now, if there's not good attorneys out there using that in
[1:27:36.800 --> 1:27:40.800]  their court cases right now to show that no, nobody on January
[1:27:40.800 --> 1:27:43.800]  6th, I don't care if a thousand people ran up to a locked door,
[1:27:43.800 --> 1:27:44.800]  they would have never gotten in.
[1:27:44.800 --> 1:27:46.800]  And there's clear evidence of even when the windows that they
[1:27:46.800 --> 1:27:47.800]  busted out, they couldn't get it.
[1:27:47.800 --> 1:27:50.800]  So she blames the police who were ordered to stand down and
[1:27:50.800 --> 1:27:51.800]  open the door.
[1:27:51.800 --> 1:27:55.800]  She blames them and not her bosses that made the order.
[1:27:55.800 --> 1:27:58.800]  Well, 100% but that's a big, you know, that's going to
[1:27:58.800 --> 1:27:59.800]  expose a lot of people.
[1:27:59.800 --> 1:28:01.800]  And then on top of that, when I did this, I did it in front
[1:28:01.800 --> 1:28:02.800]  of her fiance.
[1:28:02.800 --> 1:28:05.800]  So that just shows you that her fiance is a beta male.
[1:28:05.800 --> 1:28:07.800]  We know who wears the thong in the relationship.
[1:28:07.800 --> 1:28:08.800]  It's AOC.
[1:28:08.800 --> 1:28:10.800]  He's the boss and he's the little one.
[1:28:10.800 --> 1:28:11.800]  And so she was just humiliated.
[1:28:11.800 --> 1:28:13.800]  And that's what they do to us every day.
[1:28:13.800 --> 1:28:14.800]  They mock us.
[1:28:14.800 --> 1:28:15.800]  They humiliate us.
[1:28:15.800 --> 1:28:17.800]  So we need to give it back to them in a way that's civilly
[1:28:17.800 --> 1:28:18.800]  disobedient.
[1:28:18.800 --> 1:28:19.800]  Now, I don't want to break the law.
[1:28:19.800 --> 1:28:20.800]  I don't want to cross the line.
[1:28:20.800 --> 1:28:22.800]  I don't want to actually physically ever hurt anybody.
[1:28:22.800 --> 1:28:24.800]  But if we hurt some feelings along the way, then good.
[1:28:24.800 --> 1:28:28.800]  Then I did my job because at the end of the freaking day, they
[1:28:28.800 --> 1:28:29.800]  want to control us.
[1:28:29.800 --> 1:28:31.800]  We have to take back the control.
[1:28:31.800 --> 1:28:33.800]  We outnumber every single military servicemen.
[1:28:33.800 --> 1:28:37.800]  We outnumber every single politician and it starts with
[1:28:37.800 --> 1:28:38.800]  us.
[1:28:38.800 --> 1:28:40.800]  It starts with us being civilly disobedient in a way where we
[1:28:40.800 --> 1:28:42.800]  take back the control, Alex.
[1:28:42.800 --> 1:28:44.800]  Alex Stein, stay right there.
[1:28:44.800 --> 1:28:46.800]  We've got so many videos to play when we come back.
[1:28:46.800 --> 1:28:47.800]  And I agree with you.
[1:28:47.800 --> 1:28:48.800]  We're already under martial law.
[1:28:48.800 --> 1:28:50.800]  Now they're normalizing it.
[1:28:50.800 --> 1:28:51.800]  What will be their trigger for it?
[1:28:51.800 --> 1:28:52.800]  This is a big deal.

[1:30:19.800 --> 1:30:20.800]  wait.
[1:30:20.800 --> 1:30:22.800]  Now there is not a wait.

[1:31:34.800 --> 1:31:36.800]  as well.
[1:31:36.800 --> 1:31:38.800]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula.
[1:31:38.800 --> 1:31:40.800]  Folks, this is a joke.
[1:31:40.800 --> 1:31:42.800]  This is the best thing away of 75% off.
[1:31:42.800 --> 1:31:44.800]  By the way, it works for me in case you haven't noticed.
[1:31:44.800 --> 1:31:48.800]  The hair and beard formula is working for me.
[1:31:48.800 --> 1:31:50.800]  Quite well, I might add.
[1:31:50.800 --> 1:31:54.800]  Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support
[1:31:54.800 --> 1:31:55.800]  for men.
[1:31:55.800 --> 1:31:56.800]  I go and see him quite often now.

[1:32:37.800 --> 1:32:39.800]  Folks, this is a joke.
[1:32:39.800 --> 1:32:41.800]  I mean, we're giving this thing away.
[1:32:41.800 --> 1:32:42.800]  It's 75% off.
[1:32:42.800 --> 1:32:44.800]  By the way, it works for me in case you haven't noticed.
[1:32:44.800 --> 1:32:48.800]  The hair and beard formula is working for me.

[1:32:50.800 --> 1:32:51.800]  Quite well.
[1:32:51.800 --> 1:32:54.800]  My barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[1:32:54.800 --> 1:33:08.800]  I go and see him quite often now.
[1:33:24.800 --> 1:33:29.800]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:29.800 --> 1:33:30.800]  They're desperate.
[1:33:30.800 --> 1:33:31.800]  They know we're waking up.
[1:33:31.800 --> 1:33:32.800]  They don't know what to do.
[1:33:32.800 --> 1:33:35.800]  But here's AOC blaming the Capitol Police who took orders
[1:33:35.800 --> 1:33:36.800]  to open the Capitol up.
[1:33:36.800 --> 1:33:39.800]  Alex Stein got it on video.
[1:33:39.800 --> 1:33:40.800]  These insurrectionists.
[1:33:40.800 --> 1:33:41.800]  Like Antifa.
[1:33:41.800 --> 1:33:44.800]  And that there were actual officers working with this
[1:33:44.800 --> 1:33:46.800]  and we never got to the bottom of that
[1:33:46.800 --> 1:33:48.800]  and we never got any answers about that.
[1:33:48.800 --> 1:33:50.800]  And then to this day, we're just supposed to pretend
[1:33:50.800 --> 1:33:51.800]  that that never happened.
[1:33:51.800 --> 1:33:53.800]  I have no idea what happened
[1:33:53.800 --> 1:33:57.800]  to the people on the inside who were very clearly sympathetic
[1:33:57.800 --> 1:33:58.800]  with what was going on
[1:33:58.800 --> 1:34:00.800]  and opening the doors wide open for that.
[1:34:00.800 --> 1:34:03.800]  And I'm supposed to sit here and pretend
[1:34:03.800 --> 1:34:04.800]  like none of that ever happened.
[1:34:04.800 --> 1:34:07.800]  And then right afterwards, you have a massive,
[1:34:07.800 --> 1:34:09.800]  you know, you just have this idea that throwing money
[1:34:09.800 --> 1:34:11.800]  at that problem is going to make it go away
[1:34:11.800 --> 1:34:13.800]  without any accountability.
[1:34:13.800 --> 1:34:17.800]  And so this is where these things are breaking down.
[1:34:17.800 --> 1:34:18.800]  We're not safe.
[1:34:18.800 --> 1:34:20.800]  And it's not just about members of Congress
[1:34:20.800 --> 1:34:23.800]  not being safe. The food staff workers aren't safe.
[1:34:23.800 --> 1:34:25.800]  The janitors aren't safe.
[1:34:25.800 --> 1:34:28.800]  Like, we need to get to the bottom of this.
[1:34:28.800 --> 1:34:29.800]  So that's all I got to say.
[1:34:29.800 --> 1:34:33.800]  This is the woman that claimed she feared rape in the Capitol
[1:34:33.800 --> 1:34:35.800]  and she wasn't even there that day.
[1:34:35.800 --> 1:34:38.800]  She was down the street at her office building.
[1:34:38.800 --> 1:34:39.800]  This is a woman.
[1:34:39.800 --> 1:34:40.800]  I have the clip.
[1:34:40.800 --> 1:34:44.800]  It says Collie Flowers racist because it's white.
[1:34:44.800 --> 1:34:47.800]  Collie Flowers from Africa folks.
[1:34:47.800 --> 1:34:50.800]  Alex Stein, these people, the wheels are coming off.
[1:34:50.800 --> 1:34:51.800]  I agree they're weak.
[1:34:51.800 --> 1:34:52.800]  They're stupid.
[1:34:52.800 --> 1:34:53.800]  We're breaking up.
[1:34:53.800 --> 1:34:54.800]  They're trying to declare martial law.
[1:34:54.800 --> 1:34:56.800]  They can't even implement it.
[1:34:56.800 --> 1:34:59.800]  What do you expect them to do next?
[1:34:59.800 --> 1:35:02.800]  Well, you know, when you look at the expose of Hunter Biden,
[1:35:02.800 --> 1:35:03.800]  we see him smoking the crack.
[1:35:03.800 --> 1:35:05.800]  I think it's very obvious that there's going to be
[1:35:05.800 --> 1:35:07.800]  some sort of humiliation ritual very soon
[1:35:07.800 --> 1:35:09.800]  with President Joe Biden.
[1:35:09.800 --> 1:35:10.800]  And he's going to have to step down.
[1:35:10.800 --> 1:35:12.800]  And that's, you know, just me speculating.
[1:35:12.800 --> 1:35:13.800]  That's pure speculation.
[1:35:13.800 --> 1:35:14.800]  No, I agree.
[1:35:14.800 --> 1:35:15.800]  You got Gavin Newsom at the White House.
[1:35:15.800 --> 1:35:17.800]  I think they might have assassinated Alex.
[1:35:17.800 --> 1:35:20.800]  Alex, the day, the day Joe Biden goes to Israel,
[1:35:20.800 --> 1:35:23.800]  Gavin Newsom comes and takes a tour of the White House.
[1:35:23.800 --> 1:35:25.800]  I mean, that's not done on accident.
[1:35:25.800 --> 1:35:27.800]  That gets basically no mainstream press.
[1:35:27.800 --> 1:35:29.800]  That should be a huge story.
[1:35:29.800 --> 1:35:31.800]  It's just the fact that he's basically coming there
[1:35:31.800 --> 1:35:36.800]  to usurp Joe Biden and it's just gets swept under the rug.
[1:35:36.800 --> 1:35:38.800]  And the Democrats want to give dictatorial power
[1:35:38.800 --> 1:35:41.800]  to the president to engage in domestic operations
[1:35:41.800 --> 1:35:43.800]  against quote, right wingers.
[1:35:43.800 --> 1:35:46.800]  I mean, yeah, I mean, people thought it was bad.
[1:35:46.800 --> 1:35:49.800]  They wanted to go after people at PTA meetings
[1:35:49.800 --> 1:35:51.800]  and school board meetings for the FBI.
[1:35:51.800 --> 1:35:54.800]  This is they want to use the military against the American people.
[1:35:54.800 --> 1:35:56.800]  I mean, I agree they've been doing it a long time.
[1:35:56.800 --> 1:36:00.800]  My point is they're trying to put into legislation now.
[1:36:00.800 --> 1:36:01.800]  You're a hundred percent right.
[1:36:01.800 --> 1:36:02.800]  I mean, I hate to sit here.
[1:36:02.800 --> 1:36:03.800]  I can't argue with you on that.
[1:36:03.800 --> 1:36:06.800]  It just looks like now it's when you give a mouse a cookie,
[1:36:06.800 --> 1:36:07.800]  you got to give a milk.
[1:36:07.800 --> 1:36:09.800]  They're just going to continue to take and take and take
[1:36:09.800 --> 1:36:12.800]  until we actually absolutely have nothing left.
[1:36:12.800 --> 1:36:15.800]  That's one thing I want to say for the videos that I got recently
[1:36:15.800 --> 1:36:17.800]  of AOC in Washington, D.C.
[1:36:17.800 --> 1:36:19.800]  Anybody can go to the Capitol.
[1:36:19.800 --> 1:36:20.800]  And I didn't realize that.
[1:36:20.800 --> 1:36:22.800]  I didn't realize how accessible these politicians are.
[1:36:22.800 --> 1:36:24.800]  And now I'm going to make that a regular journey.
[1:36:24.800 --> 1:36:26.800]  I'm going to go to D.C. probably once, you know,
[1:36:26.800 --> 1:36:27.800]  when they're in session.
[1:36:27.800 --> 1:36:28.800]  They're not in session very much in August,
[1:36:28.800 --> 1:36:30.800]  but I'm going the first week of September.
[1:36:30.800 --> 1:36:32.800]  I'm going to continue to go up there and get in their face
[1:36:32.800 --> 1:36:34.800]  and tell them and expose them for what's going on.
[1:36:34.800 --> 1:36:36.800]  So for me, when you ask me, what do we do?
[1:36:36.800 --> 1:36:38.800]  Well, I'm going to go fight front lines,
[1:36:38.800 --> 1:36:41.800]  front and center in the culture war by calling them out.
[1:36:41.800 --> 1:36:42.800]  What other people do?
[1:36:42.800 --> 1:36:45.800]  Well, they cannot just stand by and just let these people take away
[1:36:45.800 --> 1:36:46.800]  our power.
[1:36:46.800 --> 1:36:48.800]  I think we have to go speak at these school board meetings,
[1:36:48.800 --> 1:36:51.800]  speak at these local levels, so that we get the word out there
[1:36:51.800 --> 1:36:55.800]  that these people are literally trying to take away all of our freedom.
[1:36:55.800 --> 1:36:56.800]  And it's just so easy.
[1:36:56.800 --> 1:36:58.800]  Look, that's Jamal Bowman.
[1:36:58.800 --> 1:37:00.800]  He's a member of the squad in this video.
[1:37:00.800 --> 1:37:01.800]  I call him.
[1:37:01.800 --> 1:37:04.800]  I ask him, does he think Hunter Biden has good taste in prostitutes?
[1:37:04.800 --> 1:37:06.800]  My point being, he knew exactly what I'm talking about.
[1:37:06.800 --> 1:37:09.800]  The Democratic Party is going to throw Joe Biden under the bus very soon.
[1:37:09.800 --> 1:37:12.800]  They're going to put in Kamala Harris who's even a bigger puppet
[1:37:12.800 --> 1:37:13.800]  than Joe Biden.
[1:37:13.800 --> 1:37:17.800]  And things are going to get very, very squirrely, very soon.
[1:37:17.800 --> 1:37:19.800]  So you're very right about that, Alex.
[1:37:19.800 --> 1:37:21.800]  You know, the horizon is not looking too pretty.
[1:37:21.800 --> 1:37:23.800]  Well, we just want to folks to get ready for it,
[1:37:23.800 --> 1:37:24.800]  but we're definitely winning.
[1:37:24.800 --> 1:37:26.800]  Let's just go ahead and play one through six.
[1:37:26.800 --> 1:37:27.800]  Let's play all these clips.
[1:37:27.800 --> 1:37:32.800]  We got the clip of AOC coming out and saying she was sexually harassed
[1:37:32.800 --> 1:37:35.800]  by you for giving her a compliment.
[1:37:35.800 --> 1:37:36.800]  Here it is.
[1:37:36.800 --> 1:37:37.800]  Adam, why are you such a traitor, Adam?
[1:37:37.800 --> 1:37:38.800]  Why are you such a traitor?
[1:37:38.800 --> 1:37:40.800]  You know January 6 wasn't bad.
[1:37:40.800 --> 1:37:42.800]  You're a scumbag, Adam.
[1:37:42.800 --> 1:37:43.800]  You're the worst.
[1:37:43.800 --> 1:37:44.800]  Kinzinger, you're a douche.
[1:37:44.800 --> 1:37:47.800]  Look at Adam Kinzinger, the political douchebag.
[1:37:47.800 --> 1:37:51.800]  Kinzinger, you're a fake Rhino Republican, Kinzinger.
[1:37:51.800 --> 1:37:52.800]  Look at this douche.
[1:37:52.800 --> 1:37:55.800]  Adam Kinzinger, he sucks.
[1:37:55.800 --> 1:37:58.800]  Hey, Jamal, do you like Hunter's taste in prostitutes?
[1:37:58.800 --> 1:37:59.800]  Do you think Hunter...
[1:37:59.800 --> 1:38:02.800]  Does Hunter Biden have good taste in prostitutes?
[1:38:02.800 --> 1:38:04.800]  Does he?
[1:38:04.800 --> 1:38:06.800]  Is he got good taste?
[1:38:06.800 --> 1:38:08.800]  Hey, thanks for fitting in.
[1:38:08.800 --> 1:38:11.800]  AOC, my favorite big booty Latina.
[1:38:11.800 --> 1:38:12.800]  I love you, AOC.
[1:38:12.800 --> 1:38:13.800]  You're my favorite.
[1:38:13.800 --> 1:38:16.800]  She wants to kill babies, but she's still beautiful.
[1:38:16.800 --> 1:38:18.800]  You look very beautiful in that dress.
[1:38:18.800 --> 1:38:19.800]  You look very sexy.
[1:38:19.800 --> 1:38:21.800]  Look at that booty on AOC.
[1:38:21.800 --> 1:38:23.800]  That's my favorite big booty Latina.
[1:38:23.800 --> 1:38:24.800]  Watch it a little selfie.
[1:38:24.800 --> 1:38:25.800]  I love it.
[1:38:25.800 --> 1:38:26.800]  My favorite AOC.
[1:38:26.800 --> 1:38:27.800]  Nice to meet you, AOC.
[1:38:27.800 --> 1:38:29.800]  Look how sexy she looks in that dress.
[1:38:29.800 --> 1:38:32.800]  Ooh, I love it, AOC.
[1:38:32.800 --> 1:38:34.800]  Hot, hot, hot, like a tamale.
[1:38:34.800 --> 1:38:38.800]  I'm with the actually best politician in DC,
[1:38:38.800 --> 1:38:41.800]  in Islam, MTG, the queen.
[1:38:41.800 --> 1:38:43.800]  Beautiful, smart, the best.
[1:38:43.800 --> 1:38:44.800]  We need more people like her.
[1:38:44.800 --> 1:38:45.800]  Thank you so much, Martin.
[1:38:45.800 --> 1:38:46.800]  Oh, thank you.
[1:38:46.800 --> 1:38:47.800]  Thanks for coming.
[1:38:47.800 --> 1:38:49.800]  Oh, I'm just such a fanboy.
[1:38:49.800 --> 1:38:50.800]  Look at that big ass.
[1:38:50.800 --> 1:38:52.800]  Look at that big, juicy booty.
[1:38:52.800 --> 1:38:54.800]  Look at that booty on AOC.
[1:38:54.800 --> 1:38:56.800]  That's my favorite big booty Latina.
[1:38:56.800 --> 1:38:58.800]  Watch it a little selfie.
[1:38:58.800 --> 1:38:59.800]  I love it.
[1:38:59.800 --> 1:39:00.800]  My favorite AOC.
[1:39:00.800 --> 1:39:01.800]  Nice to meet you, AOC.
[1:39:01.800 --> 1:39:03.800]  Look how sexy she looks in that dress.
[1:39:03.800 --> 1:39:05.800]  Ooh, I love it, AOC.
[1:39:05.800 --> 1:39:07.800]  Hot, hot, hot, like a tamale.
[1:39:07.800 --> 1:39:09.800]  She's just so bad.
[1:39:09.800 --> 1:39:11.800]  I like big butts and I cannot lie.
[1:39:11.800 --> 1:39:13.800]  You are the brother Sandy Nye.
[1:39:13.800 --> 1:39:15.800]  And when a girl walks in with the itty-bitty waist
[1:39:15.800 --> 1:39:18.800]  and the round thing in your face, you get sprung.
[1:39:18.800 --> 1:39:21.800]  Want to pull off the tongue because you know that butt will stop.
[1:39:21.800 --> 1:39:23.800]  Deep in the jeans she's wearing, I'm hooked
[1:39:23.800 --> 1:39:24.800]  and I can't stop staring.
[1:39:24.800 --> 1:39:28.800]  Oh, baby, I want to get with you and take your picture.
[1:39:28.800 --> 1:39:32.800]  My homeboy's trying to warn me, but that butt you got makes me so horny.
[1:39:32.800 --> 1:39:34.800]  Ooh, I'm for smooth kings.
[1:39:34.800 --> 1:39:36.800]  They want to get in my pants.
[1:39:36.800 --> 1:39:37.800]  Well, use me.
[1:39:37.800 --> 1:39:41.800]  Use me because you ain't that average groupie.
[1:39:41.800 --> 1:39:45.800]  Little in the middle, but you got much back.
[1:39:45.800 --> 1:39:49.800]  Little in the middle, but you got much back.
[1:39:49.800 --> 1:39:53.800]  Little in the middle, but you got much back.
[1:39:53.800 --> 1:39:55.800]  So she goes around shaking her ass everywhere.
[1:39:55.800 --> 1:39:56.800]  You make a joke about it.
[1:39:56.800 --> 1:39:57.800]  They act like you're a rapist.
[1:39:57.800 --> 1:39:59.800]  It shows how weak they are.
[1:39:59.800 --> 1:40:00.800]  Yeah.
[1:40:00.800 --> 1:40:03.800]  I mean, it's an absolute joke and these are the people that are in power.
[1:40:03.800 --> 1:40:06.800]  I mean, they want to act like they're so self-righteous and so important,
[1:40:06.800 --> 1:40:08.800]  but really they're just like you and me.
[1:40:08.800 --> 1:40:11.800]  A lot of them have even worse problems than you and I have.
[1:40:11.800 --> 1:40:15.800]  So for me, seeing how thin their skin is, it really just shows you.
[1:40:15.800 --> 1:40:16.800]  You look at Adam Kinzinger.
[1:40:16.800 --> 1:40:18.800]  At least he was a little professional.
[1:40:18.800 --> 1:40:20.800]  He put his head down when I was mocking him.
[1:40:20.800 --> 1:40:23.800]  But AOC, she had to get a reaction and I set the trap for her
[1:40:23.800 --> 1:40:25.800]  and she fell forward hook, line, and sink her.
[1:40:25.800 --> 1:40:29.800]  And more people, more of us need to go out there and do this
[1:40:29.800 --> 1:40:32.800]  because what it did is it set up a domino effect of her having to admit
[1:40:32.800 --> 1:40:36.800]  that the Capitol police let the rioters in on January 6th.
[1:40:36.800 --> 1:40:38.800]  She's blaming the police that were ordered to stand down.
[1:40:38.800 --> 1:40:41.800]  This is the rats leaving the sinking ship.
[1:40:41.800 --> 1:40:42.800]  100%.
[1:40:42.800 --> 1:40:46.800]  And we know on January 6th that all those people were the biggest patriots,
[1:40:46.800 --> 1:40:48.800]  but now they're being labeled domestic terrorists.
[1:40:48.800 --> 1:40:50.800]  Those people cared about our country more than anybody
[1:40:50.800 --> 1:40:53.800]  because everybody knows 81 million votes is impossible
[1:40:53.800 --> 1:40:56.800]  that Joe Biden got that more popular than Barack Obama,
[1:40:56.800 --> 1:40:59.800]  the most popular president in the history of the world.
[1:40:59.800 --> 1:41:00.800]  Yeah, right.
[1:41:00.800 --> 1:41:02.800]  So every single person that was willing to stand up
[1:41:02.800 --> 1:41:05.800]  and do something for our country now gets thrown into a literal gulag.
[1:41:05.800 --> 1:41:07.800]  So we do not have a fair system.
[1:41:07.800 --> 1:41:09.800]  We have a system that's rigged against the people.
[1:41:09.800 --> 1:41:12.800]  And now AOC, it's like the emperor has no clothes.
[1:41:12.800 --> 1:41:14.800]  We're kind of showing you.
[1:41:14.800 --> 1:41:18.800]  I'm trying to be the little kid at the point that emperor is naked.
[1:41:18.800 --> 1:41:20.800]  And it's not easy, but more people need to do it
[1:41:20.800 --> 1:41:21.800]  because they're all accessible.
[1:41:21.800 --> 1:41:24.800]  These politicians are a lot more accessible than I even thought.
[1:41:24.800 --> 1:41:26.800]  And I'm going to continue to go to D.C.
[1:41:26.800 --> 1:41:28.800]  I'm going to make it my second home, Alex.
[1:41:28.800 --> 1:41:30.800]  And I'm going to go call these people up because people are like,
[1:41:30.800 --> 1:41:31.800]  oh, you get clicks and likes on the Internet.
[1:41:31.800 --> 1:41:32.800]  Well, that's great.
[1:41:32.800 --> 1:41:35.800]  But when I get in that, I evoke an emotional response from these politicians.
[1:41:35.800 --> 1:41:38.800]  That's the best thing possible.
[1:41:38.800 --> 1:41:43.800]  And with AOC, Dan Currenshaw, I've done it to multiple popular politicians.
[1:41:43.800 --> 1:41:46.800]  You know, the sky is the limit, in my opinion, Alex.
[1:41:46.800 --> 1:41:48.800]  I agree. And I go back to what I said earlier.
[1:41:48.800 --> 1:41:51.800]  AOC loves drag queen story time.
[1:41:51.800 --> 1:41:54.800]  Fat men dressed up like clowns shaking their ass in front of kids.
[1:41:54.800 --> 1:41:56.800]  You just say that to her.
[1:41:56.800 --> 1:41:57.800]  And it's the end of the world.
[1:41:57.800 --> 1:42:00.800]  These people have no legs to stand on.
[1:42:00.800 --> 1:42:02.800]  Alex, Dan, I want to come back and talk big picture with you.
[1:42:02.800 --> 1:42:05.800]  The midterms, Trump running, the Santas.
[1:42:05.800 --> 1:42:08.800]  As a serious guy, you do a lot of funny comic stuff,
[1:42:08.800 --> 1:42:10.800]  but you're also a smart guy.
[1:42:10.800 --> 1:42:13.800]  What is your take on the state of America and so much more?
[1:42:13.800 --> 1:42:15.800]  But I just want to say congratulations.
[1:42:15.800 --> 1:42:17.800]  How you plugged into the zeitgeist.
[1:42:17.800 --> 1:42:19.800]  We're just honored to have been having you on since the start of it.
[1:42:19.800 --> 1:42:22.800]  You've been a great encouragement to others to do what you're doing.
[1:42:22.800 --> 1:42:24.800]  Masterful trolling.
[1:42:24.800 --> 1:42:26.800]  Well, I really appreciate Alex.
[1:42:26.800 --> 1:42:27.800]  You're an inspiration to me.
[1:42:27.800 --> 1:42:29.800]  I wouldn't be where I'm at here.
[1:42:29.800 --> 1:42:31.800]  I wouldn't be able to speak freely because a lot of people say,
[1:42:31.800 --> 1:42:33.800]  oh, you're a tinfoil hack conspiracy theorist.
[1:42:33.800 --> 1:42:35.800]  You're an Alex Jones wannabe.
[1:42:35.800 --> 1:42:36.800]  And I take that as a compliment.
[1:42:36.800 --> 1:42:38.800]  I want to be just like you, Alex.
[1:42:38.800 --> 1:42:40.800]  And, you know, what you've built is incredible.
[1:42:40.800 --> 1:42:42.800]  What they're trying to take away from you is a disgrace.
[1:42:42.800 --> 1:42:44.800]  So, you know, it's an honor and a privilege.
[1:42:44.800 --> 1:42:47.800]  I'm an Alex. I'm an Alex time wannabe.
[1:42:47.800 --> 1:42:49.800]  What you're doing is just beautiful work.

[1:46:28.800 --> 1:46:31.800]  and the prices are exploding.
[1:46:31.800 --> 1:46:33.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to protect yourself
[1:46:33.800 --> 1:46:36.800]  from your family and not be dependent on the system.
[1:46:36.800 --> 1:46:38.800]  The time to be self-sufficient is now.
[1:46:38.800 --> 1:46:40.800]  We have the best deals on high quality, storeable food
[1:46:40.800 --> 1:46:42.800]  and a whole spectrum of other preparedness

[1:46:57.800 --> 1:47:00.800]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[1:47:00.800 --> 1:47:04.800]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:15.800 --> 1:47:18.800]  How many times must I tell you?
[1:47:18.800 --> 1:47:21.800]  How many times must I tell you, baby?
[1:47:21.800 --> 1:47:24.800]  How many bridges I've got to cross?
[1:47:24.800 --> 1:47:27.800]  How many times must I tell you, baby?
[1:47:27.800 --> 1:47:30.800]  How many bridges I've got to cross?
[1:47:30.800 --> 1:47:33.800]  How many times must I tell you, baby?
[1:47:33.800 --> 1:47:36.800]  How many bridges I've got to cross?
[1:47:36.800 --> 1:47:38.800]  That was time, it's absolutely right.
[1:47:38.800 --> 1:47:40.800]  We can't let him break us down.
[1:47:40.800 --> 1:47:42.800]  We can't let him get us depressed.
[1:47:42.800 --> 1:47:44.800]  We've got to fight back.
[1:47:44.800 --> 1:47:46.800]  At the same time, we've got to recognize
[1:47:46.800 --> 1:47:49.800]  that Biden was put in so you wouldn't take him serious.
[1:47:49.800 --> 1:47:51.800]  So he'd take the blame, be a joke while they put the
[1:47:51.800 --> 1:47:53.800]  martial law and the global collapse in place
[1:47:53.800 --> 1:47:56.800]  in tomorrow at 11 a.m. when I kick off my weekday show.
[1:47:56.800 --> 1:47:58.800]  I didn't get to a lot of this. I'm going to get into this
[1:47:58.800 --> 1:48:00.800]  and more. It is the COVID takeover.
[1:48:00.800 --> 1:48:03.800]  It is the collapse of the world economy by design.
[1:48:03.800 --> 1:48:05.800]  It is the end of the borders.
[1:48:05.800 --> 1:48:08.800]  It is open pushing World War III, but at the same time,
[1:48:08.800 --> 1:48:10.800]  we've got to continue to be confident and move forward
[1:48:10.800 --> 1:48:12.800]  against these people. There is a global awakening.
[1:48:12.800 --> 1:48:15.800]  That's why they're pushing the tyranny and the
[1:48:15.800 --> 1:48:18.800]  way they put this cannon fodder like AOC out in front of everybody.
[1:48:18.800 --> 1:48:20.800]  Alec Stein.
[1:48:20.800 --> 1:48:23.800]  People can find your viral work at
[1:48:23.800 --> 1:48:25.800]  Conspiracy Castle on Bandod Video,
[1:48:25.800 --> 1:48:27.800]  on Twitter at Alec Stein 99,
[1:48:27.800 --> 1:48:29.800]  Instagram Alec Stein.
[1:48:29.800 --> 1:48:31.800]  In the time we have left here,
[1:48:31.800 --> 1:48:33.800]  I can ask a lot of questions, but what else is on,
[1:48:33.800 --> 1:48:36.800]  as I say, your radar screen?
[1:48:36.800 --> 1:48:39.800]  Well, right now you kind of ask me what I see for the future.
[1:48:39.800 --> 1:48:41.800]  Well, people like Mayra Flores gives me a lot of hope
[1:48:41.800 --> 1:48:43.800]  for the midterms. I think people, you know,
[1:48:43.800 --> 1:48:45.800]  are going to start to wake up and there will be
[1:48:45.800 --> 1:48:47.800]  some sort of red wave, but at the same time,
[1:48:47.800 --> 1:48:49.800]  I have people like Mehmet Oz that gives me,
[1:48:49.800 --> 1:48:51.800]  you know, a lot of worry.
[1:48:51.800 --> 1:48:54.800]  So I think it's just very obvious that no politician
[1:48:54.800 --> 1:48:56.800]  is actually going to be able to solve this problem.
[1:48:56.800 --> 1:48:58.800]  It's going to be an internal problem, and I remember
[1:48:58.800 --> 1:49:00.800]  one of the hardest times of my life when I was a young kid,
[1:49:00.800 --> 1:49:03.800]  and I said this earlier when my parents went through a divorce,
[1:49:03.800 --> 1:49:05.800]  and the only thing that they could say that would help me
[1:49:05.800 --> 1:49:07.800]  is you can't worry about the things you can't control.
[1:49:07.800 --> 1:49:09.800]  So that doesn't mean you shouldn't worry,
[1:49:09.800 --> 1:49:11.800]  but that means you've got to take control of the things
[1:49:11.800 --> 1:49:13.800]  that you can control and get your life in order
[1:49:13.800 --> 1:49:15.800]  and get prepared, because what's going to happen is
[1:49:15.800 --> 1:49:17.800]  there is going to be some sort of World War III.
[1:49:17.800 --> 1:49:19.800]  Look at the conflicts in Russia and Ukraine.
[1:49:19.800 --> 1:49:21.800]  There's no doubt in my mind with the nearly $100 billion
[1:49:21.800 --> 1:49:23.800]  that we've invested in that, that it's going to,
[1:49:23.800 --> 1:49:25.800]  you know, it's going to come to a head
[1:49:25.800 --> 1:49:27.800]  and we're going to have to actually get involved.
[1:49:27.800 --> 1:49:29.800]  So there's going to be young Americans that are probably going to have
[1:49:29.800 --> 1:49:31.800]  to die over a proxy war that doesn't benefit
[1:49:31.800 --> 1:49:33.800]  the American people. So I see that on the horizon.
[1:49:33.800 --> 1:49:35.800]  And then what I see and I hope
[1:49:35.800 --> 1:49:37.800]  is that it'll expose the Biden crime family
[1:49:37.800 --> 1:49:39.800]  and it'll show the illegal business
[1:49:39.800 --> 1:49:41.800]  dealings that Hunters was doing with China and the Ukraine.
[1:49:41.800 --> 1:49:44.800]  And that might not agree, but it's all been shown
[1:49:44.800 --> 1:49:47.800]  and the FBI is controlled, so nothing's done.
[1:49:47.800 --> 1:49:49.800]  It's Chinese controlling them, the Russians,
[1:49:49.800 --> 1:49:53.800]  hookers, pedophilia. I mean, it's insane.
[1:49:53.800 --> 1:49:56.800]  Yes, but in the humiliation ritual when they have to take them out,
[1:49:56.800 --> 1:49:58.800]  they might have to accidentally expose them,
[1:49:58.800 --> 1:50:00.800]  because these people really aren't that smart.
[1:50:00.800 --> 1:50:02.800]  They're not that talented. They make mistakes,
[1:50:02.800 --> 1:50:04.800]  and the cover-up is always worse than the crime.
[1:50:04.800 --> 1:50:07.800]  So them trying to cover up for the Biden crime family,
[1:50:07.800 --> 1:50:09.800]  I believe will be a mass awakening,
[1:50:09.800 --> 1:50:11.800]  and then you look at the sudden adult death syndrome.
[1:50:11.800 --> 1:50:13.800]  Now with the vaccines going to children,
[1:50:13.800 --> 1:50:15.800]  there's going to be a high increase in SIDS,
[1:50:15.800 --> 1:50:17.800]  a sudden infant death syndrome.
[1:50:17.800 --> 1:50:19.800]  Now, it doesn't take a genius to realize
[1:50:19.800 --> 1:50:21.800]  why are young children dying? They're going to be people that are on the left.
[1:50:21.800 --> 1:50:23.800]  There are coffin makers across the world
[1:50:23.800 --> 1:50:27.800]  ordering the record number of coffins for babies.
[1:50:27.800 --> 1:50:30.800]  That's exactly right. This is going to wake people up, Alex.
[1:50:30.800 --> 1:50:33.800]  It's not going to happen easy because there's no amount of evidence
[1:50:33.800 --> 1:50:36.800]  that can convince an idiot, but people will get a personally affected
[1:50:36.800 --> 1:50:39.800]  by this, and they will have no choice but to realize
[1:50:39.800 --> 1:50:42.800]  and spread the information that you and I talk about all the time.
[1:50:42.800 --> 1:50:45.800]  You look at Jamie Raskin, his daughter died of adult death syndrome
[1:50:45.800 --> 1:50:47.800]  at 21 years old in her sleep.
[1:50:47.800 --> 1:50:49.800]  Now, obviously, he's a left-leaning politician,
[1:50:49.800 --> 1:50:51.800]  and he's a lefty politician that is, you know,
[1:50:51.800 --> 1:50:53.800]  running basically the January 6th committee.
[1:50:53.800 --> 1:50:56.800]  But how many people can actually have their young 20-year-old,
[1:50:56.800 --> 1:51:00.800]  22-year-old, 7-year-old, 8-year-old daughter die or son
[1:51:00.800 --> 1:51:03.800]  and still support this party?
[1:51:03.800 --> 1:51:06.800]  I think he's so, so down and so soloist and giving over to Grand Illusion
[1:51:06.800 --> 1:51:08.800]  he'll go along with it, he is.
[1:51:08.800 --> 1:51:11.800]  Well, he will, he will, but my point being is other people will not.
[1:51:11.800 --> 1:51:13.800]  You're going to have people that like him,
[1:51:13.800 --> 1:51:15.800]  but they're not going to be okay with their 9-year-old son dying.
[1:51:15.800 --> 1:51:17.800]  There's going to be a lot of people not okay
[1:51:17.800 --> 1:51:19.800]  with their 11-year-old daughter dying in their sleep,
[1:51:19.800 --> 1:51:21.800]  and they're going to wake up and they're going to see.
[1:51:21.800 --> 1:51:24.800]  Now, everything, even the people on the left now realize the mask was bullcrap.
[1:51:24.800 --> 1:51:26.800]  I mean, if a pair of Levi's can't stop a fart,
[1:51:26.800 --> 1:51:28.800]  how is a mask going to stop a deadly virus?
[1:51:28.800 --> 1:51:32.800]  People are realizing that a mask was literally COVID theater.
[1:51:32.800 --> 1:51:34.800]  It's the MAGA hat for the left,
[1:51:34.800 --> 1:51:37.800]  and the people that I saw, you know, a few people on the planes wearing them,
[1:51:37.800 --> 1:51:41.800]  they're coming to realize that it's all a control method.
[1:51:41.800 --> 1:51:44.800]  The people that are vaccinated, now they're on their fourth, their fifth booster,
[1:51:44.800 --> 1:51:46.800]  their hair is going to start falling out,
[1:51:46.800 --> 1:51:48.800]  they're going to all start getting myocarditis.
[1:51:48.800 --> 1:51:50.800]  This will come to a head, Alex,
[1:51:50.800 --> 1:51:55.800]  and it will overwhelm them with information that they can't ignore the elephant in the room.
[1:51:55.800 --> 1:51:59.800]  So I have hope, but sadly that hope is going to be mixed with a lot of despair,
[1:51:59.800 --> 1:52:02.800]  a lot of young children dying.
[1:52:02.800 --> 1:52:04.800]  No, you're right, you're right, it's going to get so bad they're going to have to wake up,
[1:52:04.800 --> 1:52:06.800]  but you're absolutely right historically.
[1:52:06.800 --> 1:52:08.800]  Evil's like cancer, it just takes over.
[1:52:08.800 --> 1:52:10.800]  It doesn't even have a brain.
[1:52:10.800 --> 1:52:12.800]  We look at it and go, well, it must be in charge, it's taking over.
[1:52:12.800 --> 1:52:14.800]  No, it doesn't know what it's doing, it's out of control.
[1:52:14.800 --> 1:52:16.800]  It's really us that have allowed it to do this.
[1:52:16.800 --> 1:52:19.800]  You're right, we need to look at ourselves and say no to this.
[1:52:19.800 --> 1:52:21.800]  Yeah, well, it's a hive mind mentality,
[1:52:21.800 --> 1:52:23.800]  and people have that monkey see monkey do,
[1:52:23.800 --> 1:52:25.800]  and they feel like they have to get vaccinated for work.
[1:52:25.800 --> 1:52:27.800]  But people are going to lose their jobs.
[1:52:27.800 --> 1:52:30.800]  The upcoming energy crisis, you're in Texas, I'm in Texas,
[1:52:30.800 --> 1:52:36.800]  it's 108 degrees and all of the energy companies are saying that they want us to
[1:52:36.800 --> 1:52:38.800]  turn down the energy from 2 to 6 p.m.
[1:52:38.800 --> 1:52:42.800]  All the left wing media are cheering for the grid to fail.
[1:52:42.800 --> 1:52:45.800]  Alex, they're cheering for, literally, if you look on Twitter,
[1:52:45.800 --> 1:52:49.800]  you look on the internet, they want the grid to fail,
[1:52:49.800 --> 1:52:51.800]  so they can be na na na boo boo.
[1:52:51.800 --> 1:52:53.800]  But that means elderly people are going to die.
[1:52:53.800 --> 1:52:56.800]  That means young babies are not going to have energy, they're going to die.
[1:52:56.800 --> 1:52:58.800]  Bad things are going to happen, and that's on the horizon.
[1:52:58.800 --> 1:53:00.800]  So you guys need to be prepared with generators.
[1:53:00.800 --> 1:53:04.800]  I was in two restaurants at business meetings last week,
[1:53:04.800 --> 1:53:07.800]  and both times, the power went out in one for an hour,
[1:53:07.800 --> 1:53:10.800]  and the next for 10 minutes, and they said it would happen.
[1:53:10.800 --> 1:53:12.800]  It was all by design.
[1:53:12.800 --> 1:53:13.800]  You're absolutely right.
[1:53:13.800 --> 1:53:16.800]  What do you think, in closing, of Trump versus the Santas,
[1:53:16.800 --> 1:53:18.800]  who do you like better?
[1:53:18.800 --> 1:53:21.800]  Who would you like to see run for president?
[1:53:21.800 --> 1:53:24.800]  Well, if I'm selfish, I would actually like it to be Trump again,
[1:53:24.800 --> 1:53:27.800]  when we set up the Santas to run in, you know, 2028,
[1:53:27.800 --> 1:53:29.800]  and then he does eight years, if I'm being selfish,
[1:53:29.800 --> 1:53:32.800]  but at the same time, you know, Trump has so much baggage.
[1:53:32.800 --> 1:53:34.800]  I love Trump, but this time, you know, you're always,
[1:53:34.800 --> 1:53:37.800]  you're never going to be great your first time of doing anything.
[1:53:37.800 --> 1:53:39.800]  When you first started out as a broadcaster, you know,
[1:53:39.800 --> 1:53:40.800]  you get better with time.
[1:53:40.800 --> 1:53:43.800]  So I believe his second presidency, he would do a lot better.
[1:53:43.800 --> 1:53:45.800]  So I would give him the benefit of the doubt.
[1:53:45.800 --> 1:53:47.800]  A lot of the mistakes that we're complaining about,
[1:53:47.800 --> 1:53:50.800]  not pardoning Julian Assange, not helping the January 6th people.
[1:53:50.800 --> 1:53:52.800]  Well, if he got back in the White House,
[1:53:52.800 --> 1:53:54.800]  forced to help out, well, there's no doubt they're scared of him too.
[1:53:54.800 --> 1:53:56.800]  They do not want Trump.
[1:53:56.800 --> 1:53:59.800]  Oh my gosh, Allison's so scared of Trump, that's their nightmare.
[1:53:59.800 --> 1:54:01.800]  He is the big, bad, boogie man.
[1:54:01.800 --> 1:54:04.800]  So if it pisses them off, I'm all for Trump.
[1:54:04.800 --> 1:54:05.800]  And I'm the same with DeSantis.
[1:54:05.800 --> 1:54:06.800]  I would like DeSantis too.
[1:54:06.800 --> 1:54:07.800]  But you know what I'm saying?
[1:54:07.800 --> 1:54:09.800]  If we could get both, if we could get Trump,
[1:54:09.800 --> 1:54:11.800]  then we could set DeSantis up.
[1:54:11.800 --> 1:54:13.800]  That would be great because if Trump can get in there
[1:54:13.800 --> 1:54:16.800]  and fix the economy, I mean, we have this massive inflation.
[1:54:16.800 --> 1:54:18.800]  People can't afford to fill up their gas tank.
[1:54:18.800 --> 1:54:20.800]  People at the grocery store, you look at these prices.
[1:54:20.800 --> 1:54:23.800]  I mean, for a pack of Coca-Cola, it's nearly $10.
[1:54:23.800 --> 1:54:25.800]  I'm just saying that they don't want to hear about.
[1:54:25.800 --> 1:54:26.800]  They don't want to hear about January 6th.
[1:54:26.800 --> 1:54:27.800]  They don't want to hear about transgender.
[1:54:27.800 --> 1:54:29.800]  They want to hear about the oil prices,
[1:54:29.800 --> 1:54:31.800]  which they admit is Biden and the globalist.
[1:54:31.800 --> 1:54:33.800]  All right, Alec Stein on fire as usual.
[1:54:33.800 --> 1:54:36.800]  Please come down to the studio anytime you want this week.
[1:54:36.800 --> 1:54:39.800]  I'm going to be in the show trial, Sandy Hook stuff,
[1:54:39.800 --> 1:54:41.800]  where I've already been found guilty by the judge.
[1:54:41.800 --> 1:54:42.800]  Now, this is how guilty I am.
[1:54:42.800 --> 1:54:44.800]  I'd love for you to come down and co-host.
[1:54:44.800 --> 1:54:46.800]  That stuff all kicks off in early August.
[1:54:46.800 --> 1:54:48.800]  Thank you so much, Alec Stein.
[1:54:48.800 --> 1:54:50.800]  I'll be down there. Thank you, Alex.
[1:54:50.800 --> 1:54:51.800]  It's always an honor.
[1:54:51.800 --> 1:54:52.800]  Honored to talk to you.
[1:54:52.800 --> 1:54:54.800]  Now, I want the listeners to have this burn in their brains.
[1:54:54.800 --> 1:54:56.800]  Owen Schreuer is on fire.
[1:54:56.800 --> 1:54:58.800]  He has a special guest with him as well.
[1:54:58.800 --> 1:55:00.800]  He's coming up for the next two hours.
[1:55:00.800 --> 1:55:02.800]  If your station doesn't cover it or carry it,
[1:55:02.800 --> 1:55:04.800]  they should at infowars.com.
[1:55:04.800 --> 1:55:05.800]  Ford's live show, Band Out Video.
[1:55:05.800 --> 1:55:07.800]  Owen Schreuer, go to infowars.com.
[1:55:07.800 --> 1:55:09.800]  Find the link and share it.
[1:55:09.800 --> 1:55:11.800]  All right.
[1:55:11.800 --> 1:55:13.800]  I'm going to walk through the martial law preparations
[1:55:13.800 --> 1:55:17.800]  of the biggest thing ever tomorrow, 11 a.m. separately.
[1:55:17.800 --> 1:55:22.800]  I have spent 97% of the money I got.
[1:55:22.800 --> 1:55:24.800]  The little bit of money I got in my bank accounts
[1:55:24.800 --> 1:55:27.800]  is to pay for my house and my power bills and stuff.
[1:55:27.800 --> 1:55:29.800]  I mean, I've spent everything,
[1:55:29.800 --> 1:55:31.800]  which I don't judge myself how much money I have,
[1:55:31.800 --> 1:55:32.800]  but we had a little bit of reserve.
[1:55:32.800 --> 1:55:33.800]  I've spent it all.
[1:55:33.800 --> 1:55:34.800]  Thank you all for your support,
[1:55:34.800 --> 1:55:36.800]  but Infowars is firing the bat signal.
[1:55:36.800 --> 1:55:37.800]  We have great products you need.
[1:55:37.800 --> 1:55:40.800]  Infowarsstore.com, do not wait.
[1:55:40.800 --> 1:55:42.800]  Now, the good news is,
[1:55:42.800 --> 1:55:44.800]  with supply chain breakdowns and other problems,
[1:55:44.800 --> 1:55:47.800]  a lot of our best selling products hadn't come in in almost a year.
[1:55:47.800 --> 1:55:51.800]  Body's ultimate tumor formula is amazing for your immune system,
[1:55:51.800 --> 1:55:55.800]  for your whole body, for inflammation.
[1:55:55.800 --> 1:55:57.800]  It's the highest level of humanoid.
[1:55:57.800 --> 1:55:58.800]  That's the key thing in turmeric.
[1:55:58.800 --> 1:56:00.800]  It's 25% off, back in stock.
[1:56:00.800 --> 1:56:01.800]  Please keep us on air.

[1:56:03.800 --> 1:56:08.800]  Infowarsstore.com to get the body's ultimate tumor formula.
[1:56:08.800 --> 1:56:11.800]  Also, new product.
[1:56:11.800 --> 1:56:15.800]  Over a year in development, Diet Force is all the natural concentrated,
[1:56:15.800 --> 1:56:18.800]  highest level ratings, just like your humanoid is,
[1:56:18.800 --> 1:56:20.800]  of compounds that are natural and healthy
[1:56:20.800 --> 1:56:22.800]  to make you up your immune system and lose weight.
[1:56:22.800 --> 1:56:25.800]  I'm still a fat ass, but I go up and down to weight.
[1:56:25.800 --> 1:56:28.800]  But I've lost 39 pounds last time I weighed last week.
[1:56:28.800 --> 1:56:29.800]  In the last three months,
[1:56:29.800 --> 1:56:32.800]  because the samples of this came in three months ago,
[1:56:32.800 --> 1:56:34.800]  I've been taking it twice a day.
[1:56:34.800 --> 1:56:35.800]  It works.
[1:56:35.800 --> 1:56:36.800]  And it doesn't give me jitters or problems.
[1:56:36.800 --> 1:56:38.800]  It is a clean, great product.
[1:56:38.800 --> 1:56:42.800]  Infowarsstore.com is 40% off.

[1:56:59.800 --> 1:57:01.800]  And it was a horrible seller.
[1:57:01.800 --> 1:57:03.800]  It's a high-end multivitamin mineral.
[1:57:03.800 --> 1:57:05.800]  I thought people wanted beard and hair support.
[1:57:05.800 --> 1:57:06.800]  We got it.
[1:57:06.800 --> 1:57:08.800]  It's a high-end multivitamin mineral formula.
[1:57:08.800 --> 1:57:10.800]  Super high-end, organic, super high-quality.
[1:57:10.800 --> 1:57:12.800]  Since I started plugging two weeks ago,
[1:57:12.800 --> 1:57:13.800]  what it really is,
[1:57:13.800 --> 1:57:15.800]  because that makes your hair and beard grow.
[1:57:15.800 --> 1:57:18.800]  Everybody's buying it because it's 75% off.
[1:57:18.800 --> 1:57:19.800]  That's below cost.
[1:57:19.800 --> 1:57:20.800]  Hair and beard formula.
[1:57:20.800 --> 1:57:21.800]  Your last chance to get it.
[1:57:21.800 --> 1:57:23.800]  Infowarsstore.com.
[1:57:23.800 --> 1:57:27.800]  Also, we held back 1,000 Second Amendment coins
[1:57:27.800 --> 1:57:29.800]  at 1776coin.com.
[1:57:29.800 --> 1:57:30.800]  So key to fund the operation.
[1:57:30.800 --> 1:57:31.800]  Find member coins.
[1:57:31.800 --> 1:57:35.800]  Your last chance to get them at 1776coin.com.
[1:57:35.800 --> 1:57:36.800]  1776.
[1:57:36.800 --> 1:57:38.800]  1776 is the number.
[1:57:38.800 --> 1:57:41.800]  1776coin.com.
[1:57:41.800 --> 1:57:42.800]  Last chance to get that.
[1:57:42.800 --> 1:58:11.800]  I want Shroyer to take it over.
[1:58:12.800 --> 1:58:15.800]  And for the final 75 people to become founding members
[1:58:15.800 --> 1:58:18.800]  for this big project we're launching in the near future,
[1:58:18.800 --> 1:58:21.800]  you'll also get a personal signed piece of art I made
[1:58:21.800 --> 1:58:24.800]  of the sheepdog chasing the wolf in a personal message.
[1:58:24.800 --> 1:58:27.800]  It's your last chance to get all three coins
[1:58:27.800 --> 1:58:31.800]  at 1776coin.com.
[1:58:31.800 --> 1:58:33.800]  This is history happening now.
[1:58:33.800 --> 1:58:36.800]  Infowarsstore support is changing the world.
[1:58:36.800 --> 1:58:40.800]  And this is the final 75 three-coin set
[1:58:40.800 --> 1:58:50.800]  exclusively available at 1776coin.com.
[1:58:50.800 --> 1:58:51.800]  Granny Do Right.
[1:58:51.800 --> 1:58:52.800]  Granny Do Right.
[1:58:52.800 --> 1:58:53.800]  Thanks for holding her on the ear.
[1:58:53.800 --> 1:58:54.800]  Go ahead.
[1:58:54.800 --> 1:58:55.800]  Yeah.
[1:58:55.800 --> 1:58:57.800]  First of all, let me say I love your products.
[1:58:57.800 --> 1:58:58.800]  I am a granny.
[1:58:58.800 --> 1:59:01.800]  And for all the senior citizens out there
[1:59:01.800 --> 1:59:04.800]  that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me,
[1:59:04.800 --> 1:59:06.800]  I was loaded up with sunspots or H-spots
[1:59:06.800 --> 1:59:08.800]  as they're lovingly called.
[1:59:08.800 --> 1:59:11.800]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years,
[1:59:11.800 --> 1:59:14.800]  my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[1:59:14.800 --> 1:59:17.800]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[1:59:17.800 --> 1:59:19.800]  And I was already taking your other supplements,
[1:59:19.800 --> 1:59:22.800]  but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do
[1:59:22.800 --> 1:59:25.800]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[1:59:25.800 --> 1:59:27.800]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen
[1:59:27.800 --> 1:59:28.800]  immediately.
[1:59:28.800 --> 1:59:30.800]  But, you know, over a period of time,
[1:59:30.800 --> 1:59:33.800]  I started noticing, OK, you know, this is a ticket.
[1:59:33.800 --> 1:59:34.800]  This is working.
[1:59:34.800 --> 1:59:35.800]  This is wonderful.
[1:59:35.800 --> 1:59:39.800]  You know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore.
[1:59:39.800 --> 1:59:42.800]  You know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully.
[1:59:42.800 --> 2:00:06.800]  And it really has totally cleared up my skin.
