[00:00:04.717 --> 00:00:09.680]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.500]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:30.500]  [Music]
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.255]   InfoWars Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:00:35.956 --> 00:00:47.265]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Troyer with you here, filling in for Alex as he is on the witness stand today in Connecticut.
[00:00:50.608 --> 00:01:00.716]  And they're in a break right now, but we are going to go live to Alex's testimony when they return from break.
[00:01:00.876 --> 00:01:03.739]  We've got the live feeds up and ready to go.
[00:01:04.821 --> 00:01:09.603]  And we will be going to them once they return from break.
[00:01:09.643 --> 00:01:27.031]  But I gotta tell ya, I was watching the case this morning and I don't know how any neutral observer cannot see what's going on with this case.
[00:01:28.672 --> 00:01:45.166]   Now, let me just briefly explain what I saw this morning, Alex is being instructed on what he can say and can't say by the judge.
[00:01:45.286 --> 00:01:50.929]  The judge literally sits there, like he's lecturing, like she's lecturing a kindergartner or something.
[00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.371]  And that's what this is, it's expecting Alex to be treated like a toddler.
[00:01:56.872 --> 00:02:00.153]  And honestly, part of me is like, maybe Alex should just start acting like a toddler up there.
[00:02:00.554 --> 00:02:03.155]  Like, moo-moo, goo-goo, like, I don't know, don't know.
[00:02:03.769 --> 00:02:05.390]  Like, you guys want to treat him like a toddler?
[00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.011]  Then he'll just act like a toddler if that's what you want.
[00:02:07.612 --> 00:02:08.592]  You're just setting him up.
[00:02:09.673 --> 00:02:15.577]  So the judge sits up there and says, you can't say this, you can't say this, you can't say this, you can't say this, you can't say this, you can't say this.
[00:02:16.498 --> 00:02:18.319]  And, I mean, what is he supposed to do?
[00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:19.800]  She's like, okay.
[00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:22.862]  This obviously isn't a trial.
[00:02:22.882 --> 00:02:24.783]  This is a kangaroo court.
[00:02:25.003 --> 00:02:25.824]  It's a rigged system.
[00:02:26.965 --> 00:02:28.566]  Bunch of Democrats going after an enemy.
[00:02:30.507 --> 00:02:31.788]  I've never seen anything like it.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.722]  That went on for quite a while before he even got on the stand.
[00:02:37.762 --> 00:02:39.463]  He was being told by the judge what he can't say.
[00:02:40.023 --> 00:02:41.024]  Then he gets on the stand.
[00:02:43.065 --> 00:02:49.608]  And the plaintiff's lawyer starts asking Alex about a bunch of stuff.
[00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.510]  None of it has to do with Sandy Hook.
[00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.971]  None of it.
[00:02:55.752 --> 00:03:02.095]  And it was all stuff that he said either on or off the air this week.
[00:03:05.274 --> 00:03:09.316]  And the lawyer's sitting there asking about a bunch of different stuff that happened this week.
[00:03:10.217 --> 00:03:12.157]  Not even about what he's supposed to be in there about.
[00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:14.118]  Just totally other stuff.
[00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:15.779]  And the other cases.
[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.101]  Nothing about this case.
[00:03:19.561 --> 00:03:21.882]  Nothing about the people suing him.
[00:03:22.322 --> 00:03:24.764]  Nothing about what he said years ago.
[00:03:25.664 --> 00:03:26.124]  None of that.
[00:03:26.384 --> 00:03:27.765]  All new stuff, what he said.
[00:03:28.325 --> 00:03:29.966]  Nothing even to do with the case.
[00:03:32.327 --> 00:03:35.874]   Then, And this is the craziest part.
[00:03:35.914 --> 00:03:36.795]  It just kept getting worse.
[00:03:39.117 --> 00:03:45.262]  Then, the attorney is asking Alex questions, which are trap questions.
[00:03:46.963 --> 00:03:49.065]  And, I mean, really there's no way for him to respond.
[00:03:49.085 --> 00:03:55.230]  That's why it's like, I mean, I'm almost watching this like, the only way for you to respond, Alex, is just act like a baby.
[00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:56.471]  Act like a toddler.
[00:03:57.192 --> 00:03:58.593]  They want to treat you like a little toddler?
[00:03:58.613 --> 00:03:59.894]  They want to make a whole show out of this?
[00:04:00.455 --> 00:04:04.547]   They want to do a whole ritualistic Psychological torture of you?
[00:04:05.167 --> 00:04:07.408]  Don't give into it, just play into it!
[00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:10.910]  Don't let it break you, embrace it!
[00:04:12.771 --> 00:04:19.815]  I'm not giving Alex legal advice here, I'm just sitting here as an observer thinking this is what I would probably do.
[00:04:21.256 --> 00:04:31.662]  So the lawyer starts asking him questions, and when Alex doesn't give the answer that they want, the judge scolds Alex and says, no, you have to say this.
[00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:34.888]  What?
[00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.453]  So, I mean, honestly, what should... I don't know what else you can do if you're Alex up there.
[00:04:42.173 --> 00:04:45.636]  Being told what you can say, what you can't say, and then how you have to answer questions.
[00:04:46.576 --> 00:04:49.318]  I mean, so, it's like the lawyer asks Alex a question.
[00:04:49.358 --> 00:04:53.021]  If I was Alex, I'd just turn to the judge and say, uh, judge, what am I supposed to say?
[00:04:53.041 --> 00:04:54.722]  I don't know.
[00:04:54.762 --> 00:04:55.802]  I'm not allowed to say what I want.
[00:04:55.842 --> 00:04:56.763]  I'm not allowed to say the truth.
[00:04:56.823 --> 00:04:58.144]  So, why don't you tell me what to say?
[00:04:58.744 --> 00:05:00.406]  Why don't you just answer all the questions for me?
[00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:02.067]  This is a totally fair case, isn't it?
[00:05:02.327 --> 00:05:03.668]  I'm so glad justice is working.
[00:05:04.943 --> 00:05:11.809]  Holy smokes, ladies and gentlemen, another day where I'm doing double duty and I've got too much news.
[00:05:12.269 --> 00:05:19.094]  Two shows are not enough to fill with news coverage with all the stuff I have on my desk.
[00:05:19.435 --> 00:05:30.784]  And I think it is more important at this point to show you Alex Jones' live testimony from the case in Connecticut.
[00:05:33.063 --> 00:05:36.025]  We're here live on this Alex Jones Show, Thursday, September 22, 2022.
[00:05:36.465 --> 00:05:38.346]  Owen Schroer filling in.
[00:05:38.386 --> 00:05:42.448]  Royce White going to be filling in as well later on in the transmission, hosting.
[00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:45.750]  A great professional basketball player.
[00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.974]  Total red pill machine when he's on the court, so looking forward to that.
[00:05:53.414 --> 00:05:58.997]  They're in break right now, as you can see on the screen, they're in break right now in the case.
[00:06:00.313 --> 00:06:05.014]  In Connecticut and so when they come back with Alex on the stand we are going to take that live.
[00:06:06.355 --> 00:06:11.476]  Now I already did a brief breakdown of what has happened so far today in the prior segment.
[00:06:12.957 --> 00:06:19.358]  So I want to tell you what I have in front of my desk or on my desk as far as the news is concerned today.
[00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:25.000]  While we're waiting for them to get Alex back on the stand.
[00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:31.728]  But for those of you that didn't hear the first five minutes, it's pretty much exactly what you might expect.
[00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:42.534]  Alex is told what he can't say, and then when he doesn't answer the question the way all the Democrats in the courtroom want him to, he then gets scolded by the judge and told what he's supposed to say to answer the question.
[00:06:42.795 --> 00:06:45.416]  So I mean, really, the judge should just be in there talking for Alex.
[00:06:46.377 --> 00:06:49.018]  I mean, there's no point of you and Alex even being on the stand.
[00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:54.982]  He's told what he can't say, and then when they ask questions he's not allowed to answer honestly because they told him he can't say these things.
[00:06:56.007 --> 00:06:59.228]  And then when he doesn't give them the response they want, they just say, no, you have to say this.
[00:06:59.968 --> 00:07:00.648]  Not even kidding.
[00:07:00.848 --> 00:07:02.588]  They tell him what to say.
[00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:15.930]  And so, you know, I, I feel bad because I mean, there's an understanding here.
[00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.411]  We, we, you know, we knew what we were going up against.
[00:07:19.491 --> 00:07:20.791]  Alex knew what he was going up against.
[00:07:20.831 --> 00:07:34.998]   We know the historical significance and What happens in these cases, and the people that take on the corrupt power structure, the people that take on the tyrants first, they always get marked for destruction.
[00:07:35.018 --> 00:07:38.299]  They always die first, arrested first, you know, all the stuff.
[00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:49.861]  So there's a reason why I keep getting arrested, there's a reason why they got me on all these lists, there's a reason why they got Alex in all these cases trying to take the money, because we went after the tyrants first, we identified the tyrants first, we were there battling them first.
[00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:51.342]  So we have to be destroyed first.
[00:07:52.362 --> 00:07:53.122]  So we understood that.
[00:07:55.629 --> 00:08:17.333]  And so now we're in this period of in limbo, where they've already decided they're going to shut this transmission down, they're going to shut this broadcast down, and the censorship wasn't enough, so now they have to take all of Alex's money, and then who knows what else they're going to pull.
[00:08:17.753 --> 00:08:21.674]  I mean, folks, any day they could come in here and just take all this equipment and say it's ours.
[00:08:23.795 --> 00:08:25.175]  And that'll be that.
[00:08:27.023 --> 00:08:58.285]   So there's a level of we knew this was coming but then there's a level of do we continue to pay the price to stay in the fight when it's like this Alex can make a decision to say I'm gonna purchase a bunch of new product with the money coming in so that we can stay on the air knowing that any minute they could just pull the plug On this whole thing.
[00:08:59.086 --> 00:09:00.547]  So then you got a bunch of products you can't sell.
[00:09:01.768 --> 00:09:06.231]  But we also want to keep the broadcast on the air so we get the product to sell.
[00:09:06.591 --> 00:09:07.111]  See how that works?
[00:09:09.253 --> 00:09:10.694]  And then they say, oh you got all this money.
[00:09:10.714 --> 00:09:11.915]  The money goes into the product.
[00:09:14.056 --> 00:09:14.616]  And they know that.
[00:09:15.477 --> 00:09:16.278]  Or maybe they don't know that.
[00:09:16.318 --> 00:09:17.458]  I mean these are communists after all.
[00:09:17.498 --> 00:09:19.219]  Maybe they have no idea how the free market works.
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.561]  Maybe they really have no idea how business happens.
[00:09:21.821 --> 00:09:22.662]  Maybe that's how it happens.
[00:09:22.842 --> 00:09:23.322]  Maybe that's why.
[00:09:23.342 --> 00:09:25.163]  So we're going to have that.
[00:09:25.183 --> 00:09:28.730]   But let me just Focus myself on the news here.
[00:09:30.851 --> 00:09:43.315]  The latest in the escalation of the war of United States against Russia, because that's what it is, and that's why Russia's pissed.
[00:09:45.197 --> 00:09:47.938]  And so, you can think Putin is the good guy or the bad guy.
[00:09:47.978 --> 00:09:55.742]  The point is, Americans are killing Russians and funding and giving weapons to people that are killing Russians.
[00:09:56.542 --> 00:09:59.163]  And Russia is just saying, so what do you expect us to do?
[00:09:59.203 --> 00:10:00.264]  Just let you sit here and kill us?
[00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:02.585]  With no reaction, no response?
[00:10:04.486 --> 00:10:06.667]  And of course the media is lying to you about what's going on.
[00:10:07.247 --> 00:10:09.088]  The White House is lying to you about what's going on.
[00:10:11.519 --> 00:10:20.763]  So then, let's say Putin launches a strike, whether it's in Ukraine or somewhere else, they'll just say, wow, look at Putin, he's the bad guy, he's escalated, he struck first.
[00:10:22.003 --> 00:10:24.284]  No, it's NATO that's been escalating.
[00:10:25.678 --> 00:10:29.139]  It's the United States and their proxy groups in Ukraine that's been escalating.
[00:10:30.039 --> 00:10:33.580]  And after those two failed, you notice NATO completely failed, NATO did nothing.
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:38.241]  The Western proxy groups in Ukraine got wiped out by Russia in a few quick months.
[00:10:39.261 --> 00:10:40.122]  And Russia was winning.
[00:10:40.502 --> 00:10:41.602]  And so now the U.S.
[00:10:41.722 --> 00:10:48.804]  has sent special forces, special weapons, hundreds of billions of dollars, and now they're actually defeating Russia in Ukraine.
[00:10:49.144 --> 00:10:53.525]  And Russia's just sitting here saying, okay, well, we're in a war with America now?
[00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:56.380]  Do I have to nuke you?
[00:10:59.342 --> 00:11:00.542]  See, they don't tell you the first part.
[00:11:00.582 --> 00:11:03.584]  They just say, look, Putin threatens nuclear war!
[00:11:06.205 --> 00:11:09.546]  And they don't tell you how people are over there killing Russians.
[00:11:10.427 --> 00:11:22.572]  But the dangerous situation now is that if Putin declares eastern Ukraine Russian territory and then considers it an invasion by Russian military protocol, they will use nukes.
[00:11:24.363 --> 00:11:26.104]  That's the dangerous situation now.
[00:11:29.106 --> 00:11:31.428]  And we've also got news.
[00:11:31.568 --> 00:11:35.010]  The Democrat murders a conservative teenager, gets released from jail.
[00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.611]  More on that.
[00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:37.452]  More on the border news.
[00:11:38.913 --> 00:11:40.014]  More on the border news.
[00:11:41.415 --> 00:11:45.678]  Rand Paul says he's going to catch Anthony Fauci for all the crimes he committed.
[00:11:46.959 --> 00:11:49.120]  The liberal indoctrination of children at schools.
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.222]  Donald Trump with an interview last night on Hannity.
[00:11:51.882 --> 00:11:52.763]  And so much more.
[00:11:53.936 --> 00:11:56.819]  But Alex has just taken the stand again.
[00:11:56.979 --> 00:11:59.561]  So I want to go to this live so you can witness this.
[00:11:59.701 --> 00:12:01.142]  America needs to see this.
[00:12:01.362 --> 00:12:07.908]  Kangaroo court, rigged court, where a witness is told what he can't say and then how he has to answer questions.
[00:12:08.188 --> 00:12:10.110]  If that's not a rigged court, I don't know what is.
[00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:11.571]  Alex, back on the stand.
[00:12:15.414 --> 00:12:22.414]  So this is live in Connecticut right now.
[00:12:22.414 --> 00:12:32.414]   Imagine what's going through Alex's head as he sits there with rigged cases against him,
[00:12:32.414 --> 00:12:39.814]   an entire political party trying to destroy him, an entire corporate world government that must destroy him,
[00:12:39.814 --> 00:12:45.814]   must destroy Infowars, and then the willing foot soldiers of this tyranny
[00:12:45.814 --> 00:12:48.813]   that feel like they're getting theirs, they're getting their rocks off,
[00:12:48.813 --> 00:12:52.514]   they're making their future, because they got Alex Jones.
[00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:56.192]  There will be no future under this tyranny, you fools!
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.401]  So it looks as if the jury is entering right now.
[00:13:01.421 --> 00:13:13.604]  All right, the counsel stipulates the entire panel has returned.
[00:13:15.684 --> 00:13:16.505]  Please be seated.
[00:13:16.725 --> 00:13:17.745]  Just give me one moment.
[00:13:20.996 --> 00:13:32.343]  By the way, there was some deal earlier, this got delayed even, uh, first thing this thing got delayed this morning because the plaintiff's lawyers weren't prepared or something.
[00:13:33.324 --> 00:13:37.587]  And so they walked over to the judge and they asked for a 20-30 minute break because they didn't have their evidence.
[00:13:38.667 --> 00:13:47.213]  Now I don't know exactly what they said because they walked over to the judge, they were obviously embarrassed, they didn't want everybody to know what happened, and the judge granted them 30 minutes to go get their evidence.
[00:13:48.072 --> 00:13:51.855]  Now do you think that same thing would be granted if Alex's lawyers came unprepared?
[00:13:51.916 --> 00:13:52.536]  No, I doubt it.
[00:13:52.676 --> 00:13:54.578]  They'd say, too bad, you don't get to present your evidence.
[00:13:54.838 --> 00:14:00.303]  Now I think the judge should allow all the evidence, so yeah, okay, give 30 minutes, go get your evidence, I want to see all the evidence, maybe give him a scolding.
[00:14:00.823 --> 00:14:07.823]  But do you think that would have gone both ways?
[00:14:07.823 --> 00:14:16.283]   Imagine thinking you're getting ahead by destroying someone else
[00:14:16.283 --> 00:14:20.323]   and destroying the very values and principles that created the most
[00:14:20.323 --> 00:14:22.002]  prosperous nation on earth.
[00:14:22.113 --> 00:14:23.755]  Imagine thinking that gets you ahead.
[00:14:23.775 --> 00:14:25.597]  Thank you.
[00:14:25.637 --> 00:14:26.878]  Whenever you're ready, turn it on.
[00:14:27.078 --> 00:14:27.939]  Thank you.
[00:14:28.019 --> 00:14:32.103]  Mr. Jones, before the break we were talking about this lawsuit that you brought, right?
[00:14:33.214 --> 00:14:33.594]  Yes.
[00:14:33.794 --> 00:14:34.094]  Okay.
[00:14:34.414 --> 00:14:49.279]  And again, this lawsuit was brought against Mrs. Wu and Mr. Kimmel and the Young Turks LLC for them stating online that you had sent child pornography to... So again, not even about what he said on the air, something else entirely.
[00:14:49.299 --> 00:14:49.839]  We'll be right back.
[00:14:50.099 --> 00:14:51.980]  Alright, Alex Jones is on the stand here.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.541]  We go back live to the courtroom in Connecticut.
[00:14:55.321 --> 00:14:55.561]  Yes.
[00:14:55.661 --> 00:14:59.162]  They followed you everywhere you go, right?
[00:14:59.182 --> 00:15:01.583]  Yes, not due to the fake child porn, but due to this.
[00:15:05.303 --> 00:15:14.452]  It's a yes or a no, whether he's had a security team for life.
[00:15:14.492 --> 00:15:16.614]  Four years since the Sandy Hook suits.
[00:15:17.195 --> 00:15:20.478]  And this gentleman here on the right, that's Tim Enlove, is that right?
[00:15:20.798 --> 00:15:21.038]  Yes.
[00:15:21.439 --> 00:15:22.680]  Okay, he's your head of security?
[00:15:24.101 --> 00:15:24.321]  Yes.
[00:15:24.762 --> 00:15:26.363]  And they walk around with your pieces, right?
[00:15:26.423 --> 00:15:27.665]  So they can communicate with one another?
[00:15:27.785 --> 00:15:28.826]  I don't know they have those.
[00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:31.390]  You flew up here on a private jet, is that right?
[00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:35.711]  I'm yet to hear any questions about what Alex Jones said on air in regards to Sandy Hook.
[00:15:35.731 --> 00:15:36.392]  Not a single one.
[00:15:36.432 --> 00:15:37.932]  He's been on the stand for almost two hours.
[00:15:38.352 --> 00:15:39.532]  You know who you're going to run into, right?
[00:15:40.793 --> 00:15:41.833]  Since this case, yes.
[00:15:42.773 --> 00:15:43.893]  Since the Texas case.
[00:15:44.094 --> 00:15:45.154]  It's just really one of them.
[00:15:45.174 --> 00:15:46.014]  And liberals are violent.
[00:15:46.034 --> 00:15:46.534]  We all know that.
[00:15:46.554 --> 00:15:50.555]  We had to get a bulletproof truck, and it gets attacked by the left every time we take it out.
[00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:54.256]  They tried to bust into it with poles and knives and axes.
[00:15:54.096 --> 00:15:55.096]  [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[00:15:55.096 --> 00:15:56.096]  One second.
[00:15:56.096 --> 00:15:57.096]  [INAUDIBLE]
[00:15:57.096 --> 00:15:58.096]  [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[00:15:58.096 --> 00:15:59.096]  I'm going to get this.
[00:15:59.096 --> 00:16:00.096]  [INAUDIBLE]
[00:16:00.096 --> 00:16:01.096]  [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[00:16:01.096 --> 00:16:02.096]  I don't want to interrupt anyone.
[00:16:02.096 --> 00:16:03.096]  So what do you suggest?
[00:16:03.096 --> 00:16:03.096]  [END PLAYBACK]
[00:16:03.096 --> 00:16:20.096]  [END PLAYBACK]
[00:16:20.321 --> 00:16:24.682]  I don't want to interrupt anyone.
[00:16:24.702 --> 00:16:27.722]  So what do you suggest?
[00:16:28.261 --> 00:16:31.461]   I objected to his instructing counsel, which is the role of a court.
[00:16:31.461 --> 00:16:32.341]  We've been set up to do.
[00:16:32.341 --> 00:16:36.060]   So if you haven't, you just, I don't want to interject myself more than that.
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:39.860]   I think if you're not just asking, you're not helping the court.
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:40.360]  Yep.
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:48.140]   So just as a general reminder, the entire justice system has been weaponized
[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:51.661]   against Americans, patriots, conservatives, Republicans, Christians.
[00:16:51.818 --> 00:16:53.239]  Truth tellers.
[00:16:53.639 --> 00:16:58.964]  You want to know who's discriminated against?
[00:16:58.984 --> 00:16:59.765]  Truth tellers.
[00:16:59.885 --> 00:17:02.908]  Is it your testimony that you've never chartered a private jet before this lawsuit, sir?
[00:17:03.488 --> 00:17:03.708]  Yes.
[00:17:05.023 --> 00:17:08.005]  Never before 2018 had you started a private jet.
[00:17:08.025 --> 00:17:09.146]  You sure you want to say that?
[00:17:09.166 --> 00:17:09.907]  Yes.
[00:17:10.667 --> 00:17:10.948]  Alright.
[00:17:11.588 --> 00:17:12.989]  He's talking about a private jet now.
[00:17:13.009 --> 00:17:16.472]  So in the financials that you've turned over to us, we won't see any expenses.
[00:17:16.492 --> 00:17:17.433]  This is all about money.
[00:17:17.453 --> 00:17:18.894]  This is all about shutting Alex down.
[00:17:18.914 --> 00:17:20.895]  Not about what he said.
[00:17:20.915 --> 00:17:21.436]  Correct.
[00:17:21.676 --> 00:17:24.318]  Don't bring up what he said, because they have no case there.
[00:17:24.338 --> 00:17:26.279]  So they have to say, oh, well, how do you spend money?
[00:17:26.399 --> 00:17:28.020]  Oh, you have security.
[00:17:28.641 --> 00:17:31.723]  One time me and my wife and my children were in Canada.
[00:17:31.743 --> 00:17:35.906]  We rented a seaplane that flew us for a couple hours up to a place to eat.
[00:17:36.646 --> 00:17:38.107]  Other than that, I've never known.
[00:17:38.167 --> 00:17:39.328]  Not until now, not until this.
[00:17:39.568 --> 00:17:46.753]  Okay, so your testimony is that prior to this lawsuit, you actually did fly on charter planes, correct?
[00:17:48.058 --> 00:17:49.059]  No, you said a jet.
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:50.740]  I'm sorry.
[00:17:51.521 --> 00:17:54.503]  If I was confusing you with the word jet... With a hot air balloon count?
[00:17:54.543 --> 00:17:55.824]  I have also run into those a few times.
[00:17:55.925 --> 00:17:56.585]  There we go.
[00:17:57.005 --> 00:17:57.626]  Yeah.
[00:17:57.966 --> 00:17:59.527]  They want to make this a clown court.
[00:17:59.688 --> 00:18:00.168]  Do it, Alex.
[00:18:00.208 --> 00:18:00.848]  That's what I'd do.
[00:18:01.569 --> 00:18:05.292]  Now the judge scolding him.
[00:18:05.312 --> 00:18:08.154]  Just see if you can answer this yes or no, sir.
[00:18:09.215 --> 00:18:14.199]  Prior to this lawsuit, you had paid for chartered private air travel, correct?
[00:18:14.219 --> 00:18:17.142]  It's a very important question regarding this case, I'm sure.
[00:18:17.932 --> 00:18:21.134]  You know about damages to the people that sued him?
[00:18:21.654 --> 00:18:22.874]  I'm sure this has everything to do with that.
[00:18:23.215 --> 00:18:32.219]  And in addition to the security team that you have, and your private air travel arrangements, I take it that you have security systems at your homes, correct?
[00:18:34.795 --> 00:18:36.657]  Does he have a security system in his home?
[00:18:36.777 --> 00:18:38.079]  What kind of a question is that?
[00:18:40.101 --> 00:18:40.362]  Yes.
[00:18:40.962 --> 00:18:41.984]  Do we have security at the office?
[00:18:42.024 --> 00:18:42.504]  Oh, I don't know.
[00:18:42.544 --> 00:18:43.005]  Does anybody?
[00:18:43.025 --> 00:18:44.727]  Does anybody have security at their house?
[00:18:44.747 --> 00:18:45.908]  Does anybody have security in the office?
[00:18:45.928 --> 00:18:46.990]  I don't know anybody that has that.
[00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:50.554]  I would bet most of the people listening have security at their house.
[00:18:50.614 --> 00:18:52.036]  I have cameras at my house.
[00:18:52.476 --> 00:18:52.877]  Oh, wow.
[00:18:56.531 --> 00:18:57.252]  Oh, they got him.
[00:18:57.692 --> 00:18:59.653]  Alex Jones flew on a private jet, guys.
[00:19:00.354 --> 00:19:02.115]  Alex Jones has security at his house.
[00:19:02.175 --> 00:19:04.717]  They got him, proving he's guilty of Sandy Hook stuff.
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.382]  We'll bring up paragraph 7 on page 3.
[00:19:10.482 --> 00:19:12.543]  The fall of a nation, witnessing it.
[00:19:13.044 --> 00:19:18.868]  Rigged courtrooms, biased judges, blood in their eye, lusting Democrat attorneys.
[00:19:20.553 --> 00:19:21.814]  424?
[00:19:20.573 --> 00:19:21.814]  34.
[00:19:20.593 --> 00:19:21.814]  424 was a full exhibit.
[00:19:21.934 --> 00:19:23.195]  45 minutes ago.
[00:19:23.215 --> 00:19:24.836]  Let's go over to the 7th floor.
[00:19:24.956 --> 00:19:25.136]  Okay.
[00:19:25.076 --> 00:19:29.056]  It was a man's full exhibit, but 45 minutes ago.
[00:19:29.056 --> 00:19:35.536]  So let's pull up the Arron F7 with my critique, please.
[00:19:35.536 --> 00:19:44.255]  OK.
[00:19:44.255 --> 00:19:49.216]   And this is a complaint that one of your lawyers, Robert Barnes,
[00:19:49.216 --> 00:19:51.576]  drafted on your behalf, correct?
[00:19:51.226 --> 00:19:51.526]  Yes.
[00:19:51.686 --> 00:19:54.966]  It was filed in a lawsuit to commence this lawsuit against you.
[00:19:55.006 --> 00:19:55.346]  Yes.
[00:19:56.447 --> 00:20:04.008]  And one of the claims you made was that on June 17, 2019, at 9.44 PM, the Young Turks, by and through St.
[00:20:04.388 --> 00:20:07.408]  Weger, that's somebody associated with that group, yes?
[00:20:08.929 --> 00:20:09.129]  St.
[00:20:09.169 --> 00:20:10.709]  Weger is a person associated with the Young Turks?
[00:20:10.729 --> 00:20:10.789]  Yes.
[00:20:11.569 --> 00:20:16.850]  Published on his Twitter account, quote, Alex Jones sent child porn to Sandy Hook parents.
[00:20:17.708 --> 00:20:21.469]  See Exhibit 1, the Young Turks Twitter account.
[00:20:22.809 --> 00:20:27.751]  And that's at the same headline in the Young Turks video page, where it still stands today.
[00:20:29.731 --> 00:20:31.772]  And so there was a tweet, right?
[00:20:32.152 --> 00:20:35.993]  And there was a headline associated on their video page, according to this paragraph, correct?
[00:20:36.853 --> 00:20:37.853]  I believe so.
[00:20:37.853 --> 00:20:38.853]  All right.
[00:20:38.853 --> 00:20:49.372]   And if you go further down, you see here that they hold themselves out as "serious journalists
[00:20:49.372 --> 00:20:53.692]   with millions of followers across multiple social media platforms and the biggest media
[00:20:53.692 --> 00:20:57.813]   network on YouTube that is completely monetized by YouTube, etc., etc."
[00:20:58.238 --> 00:20:58.458]  Yes.
[00:20:58.958 --> 00:21:08.259]  And the point of that is to show that these people who you claim lie about you have a significant platform that could result in significant harm to you, yes?
[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:12.080]  Yes, and we weren't allowed to respond back because we weren't on that platform.
[00:21:12.807 --> 00:21:15.550]  Okay, so I'm going to strike that.
[00:21:15.891 --> 00:21:18.313]  So, the... Ha!
[00:21:19.274 --> 00:21:20.195]  Hey, object to that!
[00:21:20.255 --> 00:21:22.398]  You then go down... He's not allowed to say anything.
[00:21:23.519 --> 00:21:24.160]  And let's go to paragraph 12.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.902]  He's not allowed to say a fact, as a witness.
[00:21:26.062 --> 00:21:31.048]  One of the things that you were bringing this case for was something called defamation per se, right?
[00:21:33.382 --> 00:21:34.543]  So here's what the lawyer is doing right now.
[00:21:34.363 --> 00:21:39.162]   per se, the words are so obviously hurtful that they require no proof that they caused
[00:21:39.162 --> 00:21:41.962]  injury in order for them to be actionable.
[00:21:41.962 --> 00:21:45.961]   Accusing a professional of deliberately sending child pornography to a child is a serious
[00:21:45.961 --> 00:21:46.961]  felony.
[00:21:46.961 --> 00:21:50.523]  It raises no questions as to its negative effect on your development.
[00:21:50.523 --> 00:21:55.603]   So the lawyer is now trying to argue that there's a double standard or that rather Jones
[00:21:55.603 --> 00:22:01.523]   lawyers have argued the case that he's arguing right now, but he's missing the point entirely.
[00:22:01.604 --> 00:22:04.185]  The point is that no, we can't have that case.
[00:22:04.485 --> 00:22:06.306]  The point is we can't sue these people.
[00:22:06.466 --> 00:22:07.806]  We can't get into courtrooms.
[00:22:08.026 --> 00:22:09.506]  We can't sue people for defamation.
[00:22:09.646 --> 00:22:11.147]  Only you're allowed to do that to us.
[00:22:11.606 --> 00:22:16.726]   So he thinks he's proving the point that Infowars is arguing his case, when no, you're just proving the double
[00:22:16.726 --> 00:22:18.606]  standard, which is what we were arguing.
[00:22:18.606 --> 00:22:19.606]  And...
[00:22:19.606 --> 00:22:25.606]  We did this.
[00:22:25.606 --> 00:22:27.606]  You were tasked...
[00:22:27.606 --> 00:22:29.606]  ...as proof.
[00:22:29.606 --> 00:22:32.606]  Oh, let's go to, uh...
[00:22:32.606 --> 00:22:34.606]  Let's go to page six.
[00:22:34.606 --> 00:22:35.606]  I'm...
[00:22:35.986 --> 00:22:36.686]  Yeah, page 6.
[00:22:37.366 --> 00:22:47.510]  And at the end of it, after you made these allegations, you said, Wherefore, plaintiff respectfully prays for judgment against the defendants in a sum to be determined by a jury.
[00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:48.010]  Right?
[00:22:49.331 --> 00:22:50.311]  Did I read that correctly?
[00:22:50.671 --> 00:22:50.891]  Yes.
[00:22:53.243 --> 00:23:00.189]  And as proof of the harm that you suffered as a result of this, you included an exhibit.
[00:23:00.209 --> 00:23:04.153]  And let's go to Exhibit 8.
[00:23:07.736 --> 00:23:09.738]  I'm sorry, page, this is Exhibit 1.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.962]  Alright, we gotta take another break here.
[00:23:15.263 --> 00:23:17.965]  But this is a false equivalency, folks, and they know it.
[00:23:19.148 --> 00:23:21.469]  And really they're just proving that there is a double standard.
[00:23:21.509 --> 00:23:28.153]  Because when are we going to see the big courtroom cases of the young Turks lying about Alex Jones and suing him, suing them for 200 million dollars?
[00:23:28.173 --> 00:23:28.793]  When's that happening?
[00:23:28.833 --> 00:23:29.433]  Oh, it'll never happen.
[00:23:29.813 --> 00:23:36.437]  Alright, we're back here live in the InfoWars studios and we go back live to the Connecticut courtroom where Alex Jones is on the stand.
[00:23:37.833 --> 00:23:39.494]  He could take me there.
[00:23:39.514 --> 00:23:44.679]  If we're going to get to that, I'd rather do it outside the jury's presence, because my claim... I'll try something.
[00:23:44.699 --> 00:23:44.799]  Okay.
[00:23:44.839 --> 00:23:45.039]  Chris?
[00:23:45.459 --> 00:23:46.520]  Yeah, it's him.
[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:46.900]  It's him.
[00:23:47.441 --> 00:23:47.641]  It's him.
[00:23:48.562 --> 00:23:49.082]  It's him.
[00:23:49.823 --> 00:23:50.003]  It's him.
[00:23:50.543 --> 00:23:50.904]  It's him.
[00:23:51.764 --> 00:23:52.085]  It's him.
[00:23:53.045 --> 00:23:53.306]  It's him.
[00:23:54.407 --> 00:23:54.827]  It's him.
[00:23:55.828 --> 00:23:56.088]  It's him.
[00:23:56.929 --> 00:23:57.149]  It's him.
[00:23:58.610 --> 00:23:59.190]  It's him.
[00:24:00.131 --> 00:24:00.532]  It's him.
[00:24:00.932 --> 00:24:01.152]  It's him.
[00:24:02.133 --> 00:24:02.393]  It's him.
[00:24:03.594 --> 00:24:03.834]  It's him.
[00:24:03.693 --> 00:24:10.693]  So just wait for the next question.
[00:24:10.693 --> 00:24:12.693]  Ma'am, sorry.
[00:24:12.693 --> 00:24:19.693]   Mr. Jones, for years and years and years, you called these families actors, correct?
[00:24:19.693 --> 00:24:29.693]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:24:21.177 --> 00:24:21.457]  No.
[00:24:21.477 --> 00:24:24.398]  That's not correct?
[00:24:25.439 --> 00:24:25.679]  No.
[00:24:25.759 --> 00:24:33.682]  Do you remember in your deposition, sir, I asked you about Robbie Parker, right?
[00:24:34.687 --> 00:24:34.947]  Yes.
[00:24:36.067 --> 00:24:38.788]  And you always called Robby Parker an actor many times, didn't you?
[00:24:39.628 --> 00:24:41.128]  No, I said it looked like he was acting.
[00:24:42.289 --> 00:24:43.289]  You said it looked like he was acting?
[00:24:43.309 --> 00:24:44.589]  The internet, it's a huge thing.
[00:24:44.629 --> 00:24:48.110]  Mr. Jones, is your testimony... Dad, my wife wasn't ready to finish his answer.
[00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:53.391]  I'm sorry, because now I... Answer the way we want you to.
[00:24:53.411 --> 00:24:54.671]  You know what?
[00:24:55.491 --> 00:24:56.191]  Let's do it this way.
[00:24:56.211 --> 00:24:58.072]  Mr. Jones, would you agree with me?
[00:24:59.465 --> 00:25:11.953]  That if somebody were to lie about a group of people, and call them actors, and have them fake their children's death, that would be a horrible thing to say about something.
[00:25:11.973 --> 00:25:17.297]  I'm not going to lie as to the vouching in proper form.
[00:25:17.857 --> 00:25:19.258]  It's a contrary voucher.
[00:25:19.978 --> 00:25:21.839]  Nobody cares whether he agrees with Mr. Manning or not.
[00:25:21.859 --> 00:25:22.160]  All right.
[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:22.600]  Sustained.
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:35.764]   Mr. Jones, if someone were to falsely claim That a group of families who had lost loved ones were actors and had faked the deaths of their loved ones.
[00:25:36.344 --> 00:25:39.006]  That would be a horrible thing to say, correct?
[00:25:40.327 --> 00:25:42.248]  In the context that it could be, yes.
[00:25:42.488 --> 00:25:44.269]  Could be.
[00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:59.058]   And if somebody were to spread that claim to millions and millions and millions of people, one would expect Those families who have been falsely accused, to be damaged, correct?
[00:26:00.079 --> 00:26:01.319]  Objection, this is a fact oration, Judge.
[00:26:01.359 --> 00:26:01.899]  You're on hold.
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:03.140]  Yes or no, sir?
[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:07.341]  I cannot answer this question truthfully without violating the court's order.
[00:26:07.681 --> 00:26:10.202]  Well, why don't we have an invocation then?
[00:26:13.663 --> 00:26:14.504]  What's an invocation?
[00:26:14.804 --> 00:26:15.584]  Oh, no, wait, Judge.
[00:26:15.884 --> 00:26:18.265]  This is improper.
[00:26:18.365 --> 00:26:19.345]  I'm going to object.
[00:26:19.405 --> 00:26:22.866]  So, why don't I excuse the jury for a minute?
[00:26:23.086 --> 00:26:24.407]  This shouldn't be too, too long.
[00:26:25.902 --> 00:26:26.683]  Here we go again.
[00:26:27.804 --> 00:26:29.326]  The clown show continues.
[00:26:29.586 --> 00:26:30.648]  The kangaroo court.
[00:26:33.411 --> 00:26:40.439]  When they don't get things going the way they want, they call a break and reassess how they can force Alex to say what they want him to.
[00:26:41.465 --> 00:26:48.528]  That's how you treat witnesses, is you make them say what you want, and you tell them they can't say the truth.
[00:26:49.128 --> 00:26:50.308]  That's how the U.S.
[00:26:50.328 --> 00:26:50.949]  court system works.
[00:26:50.969 --> 00:26:51.429]  Don't you know?
[00:26:51.249 --> 00:26:58.449]  Democrats running.
[00:26:58.472 --> 00:26:59.853]  I wasn't part of that agreement.
[00:27:00.093 --> 00:27:01.995]  That's fine, but that's not what I was doing.
[00:27:02.015 --> 00:27:04.116]  I think the question will show that there's no valid assertion there.
[00:27:03.955 --> 00:27:06.715]  Well, no, Attorney Pat has requested that.
[00:27:06.715 --> 00:27:09.235]  I wasn't prepared for him to invoke on that question.
[00:27:09.235 --> 00:27:10.235]  Well, I don't know.
[00:27:10.235 --> 00:27:11.235]  I wasn't part of that agreement.
[00:27:11.235 --> 00:27:14.955]   I have a certain order that if there's going to be any further effort to evoke the Fifth
[00:27:14.955 --> 00:27:18.794]   Amendment or to elicit a Fifth Amendment response to be done outside the presence of the jury.
[00:27:18.794 --> 00:27:20.474]  That's fine, but that's not what I was doing.
[00:27:20.474 --> 00:27:23.195]   I think the question will show that there's no valid assertion there.
[00:27:23.195 --> 00:27:24.195]  All right.
[00:27:24.195 --> 00:27:25.195]  Well, why don't, can you give me the question again?
[00:27:25.195 --> 00:27:28.195]  Or do you want me to play it back?
[00:27:28.492 --> 00:27:28.732]  Yes.
[00:27:29.113 --> 00:27:29.933]  Why don't you play it back?
[00:27:29.954 --> 00:27:30.074]  Okay.
[00:27:30.474 --> 00:27:42.767]  Take your time, Madam Monitor.
[00:27:42.827 --> 00:27:49.734]  Now, the... What they're arguing here is that if you say something...
[00:27:52.472 --> 00:27:54.734]  And that, and that causes somebody else to get harmed.
[00:27:54.754 --> 00:27:57.996]  That, okay, then you're going to wind up in court and having this case.
[00:27:57.836 --> 00:27:59.836]  But you know that doesn't apply to liberals, right?
[00:27:59.836 --> 00:28:01.836]  In the context that he could be, yes.
[00:28:01.836 --> 00:28:02.836]  Okay.
[00:28:02.836 --> 00:28:03.836]  And...
[00:28:03.836 --> 00:28:09.775]   Like when Joe Biden calls Trump supporters and Republicans extremists and then Democrat
[00:28:09.775 --> 00:28:13.976]   runs a child over with his car to kill him because he says he's a Republican extremist?
[00:28:14.509 --> 00:28:15.970]  Can they sue Joe Biden for that?
[00:28:17.591 --> 00:28:20.253]  Or is this just sue Alex Jones to get him off the air?
[00:28:20.713 --> 00:28:21.174]  How does it work?
[00:28:24.662 --> 00:28:27.662]   I want to answer this question truthfully without spouting a false alarm.
[00:28:27.662 --> 00:28:30.662]  Well, why don't we have a vacation then?
[00:28:30.662 --> 00:28:35.662]  What's the demonstration? I don't know.
[00:28:35.662 --> 00:28:37.662]  Can you just give me a hint?
[00:28:37.662 --> 00:28:41.662]  All right. Let's go back. Just before anything else.
[00:28:41.662 --> 00:28:52.662]  Mr. Jones, answer the question the way we told you to.
[00:28:53.662 --> 00:28:57.101]  We don't care that you swore an oath to tell the truth.
[00:28:57.053 --> 00:28:59.273]  We're going to tell you what to say, and what not to say.
[00:28:59.313 --> 00:29:08.395]  Earlier on, there may be an unusual amendment issue in this case arising from the law of the case.
[00:29:09.296 --> 00:29:19.538]  Mr. Jones suffered a disciplinary default in this case, resulting in his inability to contest liability.
[00:29:20.098 --> 00:29:24.693]   The court has established during the law of the case that Can we just back up for a second?
[00:29:24.713 --> 00:29:30.520]  So the question wasn't about Mr. Jones specifically, although maybe it was getting there.
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:36.467]  The question was, if someone spread that claim to millions and millions of people, one would expect people to be damaged.
[00:29:36.487 --> 00:29:39.771]  There's no... No, you're missing a predicate in there, falsely.
[00:29:41.038 --> 00:29:42.879]  They falsely spread this information.
[00:29:42.959 --> 00:29:45.860]  This is not talking about Mr. Jones or free speech systems.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.981]  This was a hypothetical.
[00:29:48.001 --> 00:29:50.863]  He's not an expert and he can't be questioned as an expert.
[00:29:50.923 --> 00:29:52.244]  He's here as a fact witness.
[00:29:52.684 --> 00:29:59.147]  And the fact that this is an attempt to sidestep the rule, you once again have the motion to eliminate be used as a sword rather than a shield.
[00:29:59.567 --> 00:30:02.028]  We didn't make motions eliminating to limit this material.
[00:30:02.128 --> 00:30:02.949]  The plaintiffs did.
[00:30:03.348 --> 00:30:06.428]  The contention here is that Mr. Jones--
[00:30:06.428 --> 00:30:12.388]   the law of the case is that the court has concluded that his statements were false, not because they were litigated,
[00:30:12.388 --> 00:30:14.828]  but because of failure to comply with discovery.
[00:30:14.828 --> 00:30:16.348]  We can't talk about that.
[00:30:16.348 --> 00:30:20.749]   The plaintiffs have earned the right to call him a liar in open court.
[00:30:20.749 --> 00:30:23.187]  Whether we agree or not, that's the law of the case.
[00:30:23.187 --> 00:30:29.387]   What they've not done is earned the right to put him in a position where he either disagrees
[00:30:29.387 --> 00:30:34.067]   with their characterization of him, thus running a follow-up prior ruling of the court,
[00:30:34.067 --> 00:30:37.147]  or agrees with them, thus committing perjury.
[00:30:37.147 --> 00:30:41.828]   We would go further and say that if we get to a point where an invocation is necessary,
[00:30:41.828 --> 00:30:46.148]   they're not entitled to an adverse inference, because that is giving undue weight--
[00:30:46.148 --> 00:30:55.509]   So, Attorney Pat, what would be wrong if his answer, his true answer, how would it violate the order,
[00:30:55.509 --> 00:31:02.628]  is if he says he denies the extent of the damage?
[00:31:02.774 --> 00:31:05.736]  I don't know that that's responsive to the question, can it be?
[00:31:05.856 --> 00:31:06.037]  Yeah.
[00:31:06.397 --> 00:31:14.883]  So, Your Honor, I think what's happening here is we have a sidebar to avoid a proper assertion.
[00:31:14.943 --> 00:31:16.004]  I said I'll do it a different way.
[00:31:16.144 --> 00:31:24.111]  And so I came back here and instead of telling Mr. Jones that he had lied, I said if one did... This whole thing feels very immature, doesn't it?
[00:31:24.231 --> 00:31:25.792]  Well, I think... I wonder why.
[00:31:25.812 --> 00:31:28.054]  So I think it's got to be asked in a way that...
[00:31:31.736 --> 00:31:36.960]  And I don't want to tell you how to ask it, but... No, no, let me just get it out.
[00:31:39.002 --> 00:31:40.283]  I don't want to tell you how to do things.
[00:31:40.323 --> 00:31:42.765]  That would look bad on me, but I do it anyway.
[00:31:43.745 --> 00:31:50.170]  But where the jury understands that the issue has been decided, which they've been told many, many times now.
[00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:53.533]  So can you think of a way to do it along those lines?
[00:31:53.773 --> 00:31:58.076]   So here, the court has already No, there is no.
[00:31:58.116 --> 00:31:59.076]  First of all, he's a defendant.
[00:31:59.096 --> 00:31:59.897]  This isn't impeachment.
[00:31:59.716 --> 00:32:03.716]   is just determining damages and so what's the question for Mr. Jones?
[00:32:03.716 --> 00:32:06.916]  There is no, first of all, he's a defendant.
[00:32:06.916 --> 00:32:10.516]  This isn't impeachment on credibility grounds.
[00:32:10.516 --> 00:32:17.716]   The question is, rather than ask him directly, where he now thinks a truthful answer would
[00:32:17.716 --> 00:32:18.716]  be somehow for any of this.
[00:32:18.716 --> 00:32:21.716]   They keep saying he's a defendant and a witness but they won't let him talk and he never had
[00:32:21.716 --> 00:32:22.956]  his trial.
[00:32:22.965 --> 00:32:24.525]  He was considered guilty before the trial.
[00:32:24.866 --> 00:32:27.466]  ...that if one were to do these things, it would cause harm.
[00:32:27.766 --> 00:32:34.048]  Now, Attorney Pattis is still free to argue at any point that the harm caused here wasn't what...
[00:32:37.616 --> 00:32:44.500]  So folks, let's put things into perspective here as we're about to go to the final break of the first hour.
[00:32:47.242 --> 00:32:52.646]  We've had this trial live on the air now for about half an hour.
[00:32:53.906 --> 00:32:54.987]  Alex Jones is the witness.
[00:32:55.568 --> 00:32:56.868]  How much have you heard Alex talk?
[00:32:58.349 --> 00:33:01.091]  Who's been talking the majority of this video?
[00:33:02.692 --> 00:33:03.733]  Their lawyer and the judge.
[00:33:06.411 --> 00:33:07.072]  What does that tell you?
[00:33:08.573 --> 00:33:10.774]  We'll pick it up when we come back from this break.
[00:33:11.335 --> 00:33:11.895]  All right!
[00:33:11.915 --> 00:33:13.236]  Alex Jones is a witness.
[00:33:13.717 --> 00:33:18.580]  We've been carrying this case live all show, and he's barely gotten to talk.
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:27.127]  It's been the judge mostly, and of course the plaintiff's lawyer instructing Jones on what to say, and when he doesn't say what they want, they say, no, no, no, you're supposed to say it like this.
[00:33:27.887 --> 00:33:29.288]  So let's continue with this.
[00:33:29.328 --> 00:33:30.429]  This is fun, isn't it?
[00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:34.152]  Watching our judicial system be totally corrupted by the left wing.
[00:33:34.272 --> 00:33:35.033]  It's really fun, isn't it?
[00:33:38.991 --> 00:33:44.192]   CNN admits they had fake skutt attacks on themselves back in 1991-1990.
[00:33:44.192 --> 00:33:52.192]   What they staged this, I don't know, the Penguins live in Antarctica?
[00:33:52.192 --> 00:34:00.671]   Wolfgang W. Alberts, our guest, former state police officer in the North Dakota Customs Department,
[00:34:00.671 --> 00:34:03.551]   and then over the last decades created one of the biggest most successful
[00:34:04.111 --> 00:34:09.791]   school safety training programs in the United States. CNN also pretended they were in Kuwait
[00:34:09.791 --> 00:34:13.471]   getting bombed and they were in a CNN studio basement in Atlanta.
[00:34:13.684 --> 00:34:14.144]  Remember that?
[00:34:14.265 --> 00:34:16.526]  Remember that fake CNN report?
[00:34:19.052 --> 00:34:21.833]  Don't question anything.
[00:34:21.853 --> 00:34:23.954]  The babies in incubators, don't question anything.
[00:34:23.994 --> 00:34:25.795]  Weapons of mass destruction, don't question anything.
[00:34:27.396 --> 00:34:28.396]  not just one.
[00:34:28.396 --> 00:34:29.396]  Golf a-talking.
[00:34:29.396 --> 00:34:30.396]  Don't question anything.
[00:34:30.396 --> 00:34:31.396]   And then photos of kids that are still alive that shouldn't die.
[00:34:31.396 --> 00:34:39.956]   I mean, they think we're so dumb that it's really hidden in plain view.
[00:34:39.956 --> 00:34:46.516]   So Mr. Jones, does that refresh your recollection about referring to not just one parent, but
[00:34:46.516 --> 00:34:49.356]  a bunch of parents doing the fake crime in Alaska?
[00:34:49.356 --> 00:34:49.836]  Yes, it does.
[00:34:50.016 --> 00:34:50.317]  Okay.
[00:34:51.557 --> 00:34:59.521]  And when you were deposed, you acknowledged, did you not, that you had referred to the parents who had brought this case as actors.
[00:34:59.581 --> 00:35:00.641]  Didn't you acknowledge that then?
[00:35:00.661 --> 00:35:03.983]  I mean, the only person's name I ever said was Robbie Parker.
[00:35:04.363 --> 00:35:06.824]  But I guess that's close to like seven years ago or wherever it is.
[00:35:07.444 --> 00:35:08.885]  It's a long time ago.
[00:35:10.189 --> 00:35:12.230]  Well, I'm sorry.
[00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:18.872]  So, the question was, do you remember in your deposition where you acknowledged that the families who had brought this case, you had called actors?
[00:35:18.892 --> 00:35:20.053]  Do you remember that testimony, sir?
[00:35:21.353 --> 00:35:22.934]  I think we've had like four depositions.
[00:35:22.954 --> 00:35:23.554]  Which one was it?
[00:35:23.574 --> 00:35:26.595]  Do you remember you were in my office?
[00:35:26.895 --> 00:35:27.055]  Yes.
[00:35:27.135 --> 00:35:28.116]  We were in a conference room?
[00:35:28.336 --> 00:35:28.576]  Yes.
[00:35:28.836 --> 00:35:31.897]  Okay, I was sitting just about as far as I could from the court report for you.
[00:35:31.917 --> 00:35:32.618]  I'm trying to remember.
[00:35:32.778 --> 00:35:33.658]  We've had quite a few.
[00:35:33.478 --> 00:35:37.478]  few. You and I have only had two in person, correct? Yes.
[00:35:37.478 --> 00:35:43.077]  Okay. We had one by zoom, correct?
[00:35:43.249 --> 00:35:47.852]  Alright, well, Mr. Jones, I'm talking about the ones when you were in person sitting right next to me.
[00:35:47.872 --> 00:35:49.533]  Okay, that's why I'm trying to refresh my memory.
[00:35:49.573 --> 00:35:58.677]  So, am I correct that during that deposition, you acknowledged, under oath, that you had referred to these families as actors?
[00:36:02.239 --> 00:36:07.262]  I don't remember the testimony, but I've never even seen their faces until they sued me.
[00:36:07.282 --> 00:36:07.662]  I don't know.
[00:36:08.142 --> 00:36:09.063]  So I can't answer your question.
[00:36:13.368 --> 00:36:16.549]  Um, I believe it's the same testimony I gave earlier.
[00:36:16.709 --> 00:36:17.670]  Okay.
[00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:19.730]  OK, well, why don't we-- may I approach her?
[00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:49.530]   Good night. Okay. Mr. Jones, I'm going to ask you to go to page 215. >> Okay. >> And
[00:36:47.969 --> 00:36:53.331]  And you see, there's a question where I say, I'm asking... Would you give it, sir?
[00:36:53.991 --> 00:36:54.791]  This is Mr. Jones.
[00:36:54.811 --> 00:36:55.812]  Oh, there are four of them.
[00:36:55.832 --> 00:36:56.412]  Which one is that?
[00:36:57.521 --> 00:36:58.622]  April 5th, 2002.
[00:36:58.742 --> 00:36:59.042]  Page 252.
[00:36:59.082 --> 00:37:00.263]  Thank you.
[00:37:00.583 --> 00:37:02.084]  I'm asking if you'd agree with that.
[00:37:02.324 --> 00:37:03.725]  You've given me two options here.
[00:37:03.905 --> 00:37:06.607]  One option is it is just an actor playing the character.
[00:37:07.268 --> 00:37:12.811]  The other option is it is somebody who is really who they say they are, but they're going along with the official script.
[00:37:13.032 --> 00:37:15.613]  Those are the options you gave me.
[00:37:15.653 --> 00:37:15.994]  Answer, yes.
[00:37:16.014 --> 00:37:17.435]  That's what you said, right?
[00:37:17.455 --> 00:37:17.695]  Correct.
[00:37:19.022 --> 00:37:23.543]  The first option, Robin Parker is an actor creating a role.
[00:37:23.963 --> 00:37:27.624]  In that circumstance, Robin Parker is just a fictitious character, correct?
[00:37:27.984 --> 00:37:28.564]  What would you say?
[00:37:28.824 --> 00:37:29.204]  Yes.
[00:37:30.385 --> 00:37:31.765]  That's role-playing, isn't it?
[00:37:32.325 --> 00:37:33.165]  You said yes, right?
[00:37:33.465 --> 00:37:36.406]  Yeah.
[00:37:36.686 --> 00:37:44.388]  In that context, the actor playing Robin Parker would be going out in front of the whole world to give a statement, knowing that he's just playing a fictitious part, correct?
[00:37:44.408 --> 00:37:45.168]  What would you say?
[00:37:45.327 --> 00:37:45.827]  Yes.
[00:37:45.827 --> 00:38:15.608]   Do you remember in your deposition when you acknowledged that for this hoax to work,
[00:38:15.608 --> 00:38:19.007]  it couldn't just be Robbie Parker who was an actor.
[00:38:18.228 --> 00:38:21.630]  They all had to be in on it, correct?
[00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:22.611]  You've refreshed my memory.
[00:38:22.631 --> 00:38:24.532]  I believe I was answering your hypothetical questions.
[00:38:24.552 --> 00:38:24.893]  Okay.
[00:38:25.773 --> 00:38:26.894]  Listen to the question I just asked you.
[00:38:27.755 --> 00:38:40.353]   You acknowledged in your deposition that when you were calling this a hoax, that in order for this hoax to be pulled off, It wouldn't just be Rodney Parker, it would have to be all the families who were after him.
[00:38:40.393 --> 00:38:40.653]  Correct?
[00:38:40.713 --> 00:38:41.054]  As you do.
[00:38:41.134 --> 00:38:45.339]  We're recovering the controversy of was it staged or not.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.743]  Can you answer that question, sir?
[00:38:48.404 --> 00:38:49.805]  Can you refresh me with a transcript?
[00:38:49.885 --> 00:38:50.385]  Sure.
[00:38:50.385 --> 00:38:51.445]  But why don't you do that again?
[00:38:51.445 --> 00:38:52.764]  In fact, let's-- you know what?
[00:38:52.764 --> 00:38:54.304]  Let's just pull it up for everybody.
[00:38:54.304 --> 00:39:08.206]  So this is the exhibit.
[00:39:08.206 --> 00:39:11.206]  One moment, you're all right.
[00:39:11.206 --> 00:39:13.244]  We have this stuff, right?
[00:39:12.587 --> 00:39:12.747]  Sure.
[00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:18.217]  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you.
[00:39:18.297 --> 00:39:18.818]  I know.
[00:39:18.838 --> 00:39:18.959]  Okay.
[00:39:18.999 --> 00:39:21.223]  Now, let me play a portion of Mr. Jones' deposition.
[00:39:21.283 --> 00:39:22.283]  It's an admission.
[00:39:22.283 --> 00:39:32.283]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:39:32.283 --> 00:39:40.763]  What was the executive number on this check?
[00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:43.292]  It's not an exhibit, it's an admission.
[00:39:43.231 --> 00:39:45.512]  But if you don't get to it, forget you.
[00:39:45.512 --> 00:39:46.471]  You can never predict.
[00:39:47.471 --> 00:39:50.451]  [COUGHING]
[00:39:50.451 --> 00:39:53.431]  [BREATHING HEAVILY]
[00:39:53.431 --> 00:39:56.411]  [BREATHING HEAVILY]
[00:40:20.871 --> 00:40:24.311]  Again, we are in the courtroom live in Connecticut here.
[00:40:24.114 --> 00:40:31.114]  Alex Jones as a witness.
[00:40:31.114 --> 00:40:36.074]   And you know what's sad is, I'm sitting here contemplating because quite frankly
[00:40:36.074 --> 00:40:37.552]  this whole thing is a waste of time.
[00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:38.731]  We know what's going on.
[00:40:38.751 --> 00:40:40.532]  It's a politicized lawsuit.
[00:40:40.873 --> 00:40:42.534]  Came ten years after he said anything.
[00:40:45.757 --> 00:40:47.578]  And it's all about getting Alex Jones off the air.
[00:40:47.898 --> 00:40:50.581]  And this is just, this is just ceremony, is what this is.
[00:40:50.781 --> 00:40:51.541]  And everybody knows it.
[00:40:51.661 --> 00:40:52.922]  This is all just ceremony.
[00:40:52.983 --> 00:40:58.267]  Everyone's playing their role in this grand theater of the end of the First Amendment.
[00:40:58.985 --> 00:41:01.446]  The end of opposition to political power.
[00:41:01.887 --> 00:41:04.648]  The end of questioning major events.
[00:41:04.928 --> 00:41:07.930]  That's what this is all about, and everybody knows it, and this is just ceremony.
[00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:08.830]  What's a Potemkin village?
[00:41:11.511 --> 00:41:27.500]  A Potemkin village, I believe, goes back to examples like the... Before the Russian Revolution, they would... Czars would build fake villages for PR stunts.
[00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:33.773]  I read the exact historic nature of that.
[00:41:34.013 --> 00:41:34.893]  I may be wrong about that.
[00:41:34.753 --> 00:41:38.753]   something to do with Russian history and government staging of this.
[00:41:38.753 --> 00:41:46.753]   Right. And this Potemkin village would be filled with people who play parts as if they were villagers, correct?
[00:41:46.753 --> 00:41:47.753]  Yes.
[00:41:47.753 --> 00:41:53.753]  Actors in a hoax that the government was staging.
[00:41:53.971 --> 00:41:55.933]  It's like the Truman Show.
[00:41:55.953 --> 00:41:57.394]  And the Truman Show, that's a movie, yes?
[00:41:57.954 --> 00:41:58.735]  Yes.
[00:41:58.895 --> 00:42:07.781]  Where this fake village is plopped down and everybody who populates it is in on the hoax, yes?
[00:42:09.182 --> 00:42:10.483]  I think that's what the movie's about.
[00:42:11.364 --> 00:42:16.247]  And that's what Attempting Village is to your understanding?
[00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:19.349]  It's got a lot of definitions, but I think that's a fair one.
[00:42:19.369 --> 00:42:19.950]  Is that about right?
[00:42:20.942 --> 00:42:22.723]  Is that how you were using it when you were deposed?
[00:42:24.364 --> 00:42:25.885]  Um, you just have to press my memory card.
[00:42:25.905 --> 00:42:26.786]  That's all we're trying to do here.
[00:42:31.049 --> 00:42:31.249]  Alright.
[00:42:31.869 --> 00:42:32.069]  Alright.
[00:42:32.089 --> 00:42:32.410]  Go play it.
[00:42:34.371 --> 00:42:40.015]  So I'm just at a point now where do I do I just continue to play this or do I cover the news?
[00:42:42.296 --> 00:42:46.179]  Because it's like I know people want to watch this and it's it's us.
[00:42:46.239 --> 00:42:47.499]  I mean, it's the future of Infowars.
[00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:48.200]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:49.261]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:42:50.214 --> 00:42:58.279]  But, you know, we also are on the brink of potentially having World War III and our leaders are doing nothing to stop it.
[00:42:58.599 --> 00:43:15.029]  No calls for peace, no calls for a sit-down with Putin and Zelensky and Biden, just Putin threatening war and Zelensky escalating things by saying Russia should be removed from the UN and Biden continuing to send troops and money and weapons over there.
[00:43:15.609 --> 00:43:25.200]   So, I mean, Again, this is just like cannon fodder, this is just like pornography for Democrats to force Alex into this psychological torture.
[00:43:26.821 --> 00:43:31.404]  But this is the Jones Show, and this is the fate of InfoWars and The Balance, the fate of free speech and everything else, so I cover it.
[00:43:31.444 --> 00:43:37.067]  But we may start getting into the news in the next hour, but we'll be monitoring this situation.
[00:43:37.788 --> 00:43:39.789]  Folks, remember to shop at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:43:40.249 --> 00:43:42.070]  That's the only way we're able to be here.
[00:43:42.271 --> 00:43:55.630]  Your support.
[00:43:56.334 --> 00:43:57.517]  And I believe the most powerful.
[00:43:57.957 --> 00:44:01.043]  The man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt.
[00:44:02.566 --> 00:44:03.969]  Citizen of a republic.
[00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.989]  Man in the arena.
[00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:09.951]  There's only 10,000 of this coin in existence in the world.
[00:44:10.392 --> 00:44:11.972]  It will never be made again.
[00:44:11.992 --> 00:44:14.594]  It's not just an amazing historic coin.
[00:44:15.014 --> 00:44:18.255]  It funds the information war against the globalists.
[00:44:18.595 --> 00:44:20.776]  This is something you want to hand down to your grandchildren.
[00:44:21.137 --> 00:44:22.357]  This is something you want to own.
[00:44:22.857 --> 00:44:28.080]  And as a fundraiser, it is funding the information war against the globalists.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:30.981]  Ladies and gentlemen, 10,000 coins are available.
[00:44:31.021 --> 00:44:32.042]  They'll sell out very quickly.
[00:44:32.742 --> 00:44:35.423]  Please be part of history and thank you all for your support.
[00:44:36.263 --> 00:44:42.585]  You can go to 1776coin.com or you can go to patriotcollectibles.com and secure this coin.
[00:44:42.865 --> 00:44:47.266]  There's only 10,000 of this coin in existence and it funds the Infowar.
[00:44:47.946 --> 00:44:50.727]  Man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt.
[00:44:50.927 --> 00:44:51.507]  1776coin.com.
[00:44:51.787 --> 00:44:57.089]  Badges worn by some Hilliard teachers aimed at reaching out to LGBTQ plus students.
[00:44:57.449 --> 00:45:00.350]  But some parents are pinning some protests on them.
[00:45:01.175 --> 00:45:07.899]  New at 6, they say the badges are steering their kids to the wrong place and exposing them to sexually explicit material.
[00:45:07.979 --> 00:45:10.700]  And they say school is not the place to be wearing them.
[00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:11.921]  Here's Luann Stoya.
[00:45:13.345 --> 00:45:16.046]  Some of these are not fit to... Oh, okay.
[00:45:16.066 --> 00:45:25.351]  Hilliard parent Lisa Chaffee has checked out the website and says the content is nothing kids should access, like sexual techniques and sex acts.
[00:45:25.751 --> 00:45:33.475]  The badge has a QR code that, once scanned, takes you to a website that has extremely inappropriate information.
[00:45:34.355 --> 00:45:37.248]   And as a parent, That crosses the line.
[00:45:37.629 --> 00:45:43.375]  Teachers K-12 can wear the badge that says, I'm here, safe person, safe space.
[00:45:43.796 --> 00:45:49.943]  The district says the intent of the badge is a message of safety and inclusion for all students.
[00:45:50.303 --> 00:45:53.327]  We do obviously want it to be a safe space for everybody, but we want it to be clear.
[00:45:53.827 --> 00:46:01.429]  As to what the zones are of how conversations are handled and that they're not just like this sort of misfiring in different directions.
[00:46:02.110 --> 00:46:08.071]  Well-intentioned people just, you know, going overboard in one direction or another and not having any state standards to follow.
[00:46:08.191 --> 00:46:20.735]  Nobody from the district would answer our questions on camera, but the superintendent sent us a statement reading in part, teachers were reminded that the resources linked to the QR code were for adult learning only.
[00:46:21.215 --> 00:46:28.157]  Teachers were reminded that if asked about the I'm Here message on the badge, their response should be age appropriate.
[00:46:28.457 --> 00:46:33.378]  I want to clarify the law as it relates to discussions in the classroom.
[00:46:33.718 --> 00:46:40.120]  I think every teacher should be safe to go to to discuss any issue a student might have.
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.920]  They should not have to identify themselves as safe.
[00:46:44.581 --> 00:46:48.182]  Ah yes, liberals showing your kids porn.
[00:46:48.242 --> 00:46:49.902]  They are really into it, aren't they?
[00:46:54.184 --> 00:46:55.285]  It's really a shame, isn't it?
[00:46:56.345 --> 00:46:57.105]  It's really a shame.
[00:46:58.946 --> 00:47:00.967]  Is there anything liberals haven't destroyed yet?
[00:47:02.968 --> 00:47:04.609]  They've destroyed the justice system.
[00:47:05.649 --> 00:47:07.310]  They've destroyed the school system.
[00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:09.791]  They've destroyed the healthcare system.
[00:47:12.872 --> 00:47:14.913]  They're trying to completely destroy sports.
[00:47:17.354 --> 00:47:18.995]  Is there anything you guys won't destroy?
[00:47:20.509 --> 00:47:23.491]  Can you totalitarian freaks just leave us alone?
[00:47:23.531 --> 00:47:24.372]  That's all we want.
[00:47:25.012 --> 00:47:26.153]  We just want to be left alone.
[00:47:27.193 --> 00:47:28.434]  But you gotta get those kids.
[00:47:28.454 --> 00:47:29.515]  You gotta show them porn.
[00:47:29.855 --> 00:47:31.116]  You gotta teach them how to have sex.
[00:47:31.136 --> 00:47:32.777]  You gotta teach them how to have oral sex.
[00:47:32.837 --> 00:47:36.839]  And you gotta tell them to chop their genitals off and chop their breasts off.
[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:39.961]  And you call yourselves teachers?
[00:47:40.882 --> 00:47:41.643]  Yeah, okay.
[00:47:43.063 --> 00:47:48.767]  So, certainly, by now, you're aware of another Democrat committing a murder of a conservative.
[00:47:48.807 --> 00:47:49.908]  A political murder.
[00:47:50.984 --> 00:47:51.584]  That's what they do.
[00:47:51.744 --> 00:47:55.845]  They justify it because, you know, Joe Biden said you're an extremist, so we kill you.
[00:47:57.166 --> 00:47:58.826]  Now, can Joe Biden be sued?
[00:47:59.626 --> 00:48:03.287]  Can I sue Joe Biden as a Trump supporter that he's now incited violence against me?
[00:48:03.307 --> 00:48:06.048]  Of course not.
[00:48:06.088 --> 00:48:06.568]  They're liberals.
[00:48:06.588 --> 00:48:07.348]  They're above the law.
[00:48:07.448 --> 00:48:08.589]  It's a hierarchy system.
[00:48:09.089 --> 00:48:10.269]  It's not hypocrisy.
[00:48:10.289 --> 00:48:10.969]  It's hierarchy.
[00:48:11.069 --> 00:48:12.170]  They rule you.
[00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:13.150]  They're tyrants.
[00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:14.130]  They're authoritarians.
[00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:14.970]  They're liberals.
[00:48:16.371 --> 00:48:20.192]  A man accused of murdering 18-year-old conservative released on bail.
[00:48:21.707 --> 00:48:37.920]  So this 41-year-old Democrat runs over an 18-year-old boy because he's a conservative and murders him and admits that in the testimony he gave to police.
[00:48:38.721 --> 00:48:44.266]  That he intentionally ran over a child, killed him, and did a hit-and-run.
[00:48:46.608 --> 00:48:50.471]  So we got a hit-and-run and vehicular manslaughter.
[00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:55.452]  Politically motivated, and he's released from jail in less than 24 hours.
[00:48:57.013 --> 00:49:00.475]  Dr. Simone Gold walked into the Capitol for five minutes and walked out.
[00:49:00.635 --> 00:49:02.856]  She got, what was it, 60 or 90 days in jail.
[00:49:03.796 --> 00:49:14.082]  There was an old grandma, same thing, in a massive crowd of people, just the force of the weight of the crowd, she ends up in the Capitol, she leaves, doesn't even touch anything, she gets 60 days in jail.
[00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:24.983]  How many other January 6th defendants are rotting and being tortured in jail cells right now that did not commit any violent crime, did not hurt anyone on January 6th?
[00:49:26.264 --> 00:49:26.724]  Hundreds.
[00:49:28.265 --> 00:49:35.307]  But this Democrat intentionally runs over a kid in his car, kills him, and gets released in less than 24 hours.
[00:49:37.748 --> 00:49:41.349]  Now, how much of the mainstream news covered this?
[00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:42.530]  None.
[00:49:44.853 --> 00:49:46.254]  Media blackout.
[00:49:46.394 --> 00:49:51.596]  Homicidal far-left radical kills 18-year-old Republican Kyler Ellingson over his political views.
[00:49:52.196 --> 00:49:56.357]  ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, MSNBC, silent.
[00:49:57.258 --> 00:49:58.978]  I saw the story on Tucker Carlson last night.
[00:49:59.018 --> 00:50:03.160]  I believe that's the only station that covered it was Tucker on Fox.
[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:08.622]  I didn't see it anywhere else and the Gateway Pundit covers that now that no one else covered it.
[00:50:08.822 --> 00:50:18.144]   Now, you could sit here and say There's Dr. Simone Gold, finally out of jail.
[00:50:18.324 --> 00:50:21.946]  Didn't hurt anyone, didn't touch anyone, was in there for five minutes, took a picture.
[00:50:21.966 --> 00:50:23.687]  I don't even know if she took a picture and left.
[00:50:23.767 --> 00:50:25.888]  She, you know, 60, 90 days in jail, that's what she gets.
[00:50:25.908 --> 00:50:27.389]  She's a conservative, she's a truth teller.
[00:50:28.129 --> 00:50:31.271]  You're a conservative, you're a truth teller, you get discriminated against, you get oppressed.
[00:50:33.953 --> 00:50:35.854]  They keep saying, oh, black people are oppressed.
[00:50:35.894 --> 00:50:36.734]  No, it's conservatives.
[00:50:37.835 --> 00:50:38.495]  It's conservatives.
[00:50:39.215 --> 00:50:41.096]  In fact, ask a black conservative, they'll tell you.
[00:50:41.937 --> 00:50:43.458]  Have you dealt with discrimination in this country?
[00:50:43.538 --> 00:50:43.718]  Nope.
[00:50:44.278 --> 00:50:45.579]  Not until I was a conservative.
[00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:48.180]  Why do you think that is?
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:49.361]  Because liberals are bigots.
[00:50:51.022 --> 00:50:52.743]  And they're psychotic and they might kill you now.
[00:50:53.543 --> 00:50:54.404]  It's a very serious thing.
[00:50:54.444 --> 00:50:56.225]  A liberal might kill you now over your political beliefs.
[00:50:59.306 --> 00:51:01.828]  And so we could say, hey, what if the tables were turned?
[00:51:03.869 --> 00:51:11.233]  What if this was a... What if this was a conservative or a Trump supporter that ran over a liberal?
[00:51:13.223 --> 00:51:14.264]  Boy, you can only imagine.
[00:51:14.304 --> 00:51:15.164]  Well, I don't have to imagine.
[00:51:15.184 --> 00:51:16.064]  I already know what would happen.
[00:51:17.044 --> 00:51:23.526]  James Fields is serving a life sentence for running over Heather Heyer, and the mainstream media covered that story 24-7.
[00:51:24.106 --> 00:51:26.167]  You remember that?
[00:51:27.007 --> 00:51:29.008]  So I don't even have to do what-if.
[00:51:29.028 --> 00:51:30.008]  I already know what.
[00:51:32.049 --> 00:51:41.312]  And by the way, this guy that ran over Kyler, the young man, he's claiming, oh, he was afraid a mob was forming against him.
[00:51:41.352 --> 00:51:42.052]  There was no mob.
[00:51:43.473 --> 00:51:45.054]  There was no group of people forming against him.
[00:51:46.055 --> 00:51:46.795]  And that'll come out.
[00:51:47.736 --> 00:51:49.257]  He won't be able to prove that, because he lied about it.
[00:51:49.477 --> 00:51:49.957]  It's my guess.
[00:51:51.838 --> 00:51:52.999]  But what about James Field?
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:52:02.365]  He was literally surrounded by a mob, bashing his car with baseball bats, pounding on his vehicle with fists, shaking the vehicle, threatening him.
[00:52:05.467 --> 00:52:30.584]   And in a panicked response, and I believe he also suffers on some sort of an autism spectrum, And in some sort of panicked response to people bashing his car with baseball bats and their fists, raging liberals, he slams on the gas, goes backwards, or forwards, and hits a massively obese woman, who then dies of a heart attack named Heather Heyer.
[00:52:31.264 --> 00:52:38.629]  And he's serving a life sentence right now, and Heather Heyer's life was eulogized on mainstream media for months.
[00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:40.331]  For months.
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:44.582]  So we already know, we already know the story here.
[00:52:47.324 --> 00:52:48.605]  Liberals can get away with murder.
[00:52:51.147 --> 00:52:51.967]  And they've done it again.
[00:52:53.608 --> 00:52:55.970]  Just look at the two-tiered justice system.
[00:52:56.270 --> 00:53:01.594]  Now you might agree with the case and the result in the James Field case, you might agree with that.
[00:53:03.976 --> 00:53:05.797]  But where is the equal application here?
[00:53:07.819 --> 00:53:19.630]   Will the man that just ran over A teenager, because of a political dispute, because he was a conservative, and Joe Biden said conservatives are extremists, and he said he was a Republican extremist, so I ran over with my car.
[00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:22.252]  He then gets released in less than 24 hours.
[00:53:22.713 --> 00:53:24.394]  Is he going to be serving a life sentence too?
[00:53:26.316 --> 00:53:27.237]  Somehow I doubt it.
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:31.841]  Somehow I doubt it.
[00:53:33.703 --> 00:53:36.446]  And you know, I'll actually give this individual credit.
[00:53:37.609 --> 00:53:42.111]  And I imagine there's still more facts in this case to come out, so I don't want to jump to too many conclusions here.
[00:53:43.171 --> 00:53:51.354]  But I actually give Shannon Brandt credit because he's smart enough to know, oops, I just killed this kid.
[00:53:51.374 --> 00:53:52.414]  Eww.
[00:53:53.855 --> 00:53:54.915]  How can I get away with it?
[00:53:55.955 --> 00:53:56.335]  I know.
[00:53:57.076 --> 00:53:58.536]  I'll say he's a Republican.
[00:53:59.496 --> 00:54:03.918]  Then the entire Democrat Party and mainstream media and justice system will have my back.
[00:54:08.729 --> 00:54:09.569]  Pretty smart move, actually.
[00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:15.552]  So, I mean, yeah, if you get caught with a dead body in your trunk, just say, hey, well, I'm a liberal Democrat.
[00:54:15.572 --> 00:54:16.613]  He was a Republican extremist.
[00:54:16.653 --> 00:54:17.313]  Joe Biden told me.
[00:54:19.014 --> 00:54:20.775]  Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm a liberal Democrat.
[00:54:20.795 --> 00:54:23.637]  The FBI said Trump supporters are the biggest threat to this country.
[00:54:23.857 --> 00:54:24.797]  So you're welcome.
[00:54:26.838 --> 00:54:28.539]  Yeah, I ran that kid over and killed him.
[00:54:28.579 --> 00:54:29.720]  He was a dirty Trump supporter.
[00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:30.720]  He's a maggot extremist.
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:32.601]  I'm doing Joe Biden's job.
[00:54:33.962 --> 00:54:35.322]  Doing what the FBI told me to do.
[00:54:35.382 --> 00:54:36.543]  I'm hunting down Republicans.
[00:54:36.783 --> 00:54:38.084]  I'm hunting down conservatives.
[00:54:41.328 --> 00:54:42.769]  So Heather Heyer was eulogized.
[00:54:45.291 --> 00:54:50.395]  It's pretty obvious that James Fields, A, did not intend to kill Heather Heyer.
[00:54:50.575 --> 00:54:53.497]  He didn't know who he was hitting when he slammed on his gas.
[00:54:54.658 --> 00:55:00.822]  And it's obvious that James Fields was not politically motivated to kill a bunch of people that day at the march.
[00:55:00.883 --> 00:55:02.344]  Otherwise, that's what he would have done.
[00:55:03.665 --> 00:55:05.346]  He was trying to get away from them.
[00:55:08.919 --> 00:55:11.281]  But okay, they gave him vehicular manslaughter.
[00:55:12.682 --> 00:55:15.084]  Or I don't even know, they might have hit him with first degree murder even.
[00:55:16.265 --> 00:55:17.205]  And he got a life sentence.
[00:55:19.087 --> 00:55:20.348]  So will Brandt get a life sentence?
[00:55:20.368 --> 00:55:24.171]  Because it's obvious here, Brandt intentionally ran over the individual.
[00:55:24.311 --> 00:55:25.412]  He did it intentionally.
[00:55:25.692 --> 00:55:26.253]  He didn't have to.
[00:55:26.273 --> 00:55:27.874]  He could have easily just driven away.
[00:55:28.074 --> 00:55:29.315]  He wasn't in a mass of people.
[00:55:29.535 --> 00:55:31.016]  He wasn't in a massive traffic jam.
[00:55:31.797 --> 00:55:32.838]  He could have just driven away.
[00:55:33.238 --> 00:55:36.200]  But no, he intentionally drove into the child.
[00:55:37.782 --> 00:55:38.262]  And killed him.
[00:55:40.117 --> 00:55:41.999]  And it was obviously politically motivated.
[00:55:42.039 --> 00:55:43.780]  He said so in his own statement.
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:45.081]  Saying, yeah, I killed him.
[00:55:45.101 --> 00:55:46.122]  He was a MAGA extremist.
[00:55:46.843 --> 00:55:48.024]  He was a Republican extremist.
[00:55:51.546 --> 00:55:52.587]  So which is worse?
[00:55:53.908 --> 00:56:05.125]   James Fields in a crowd of people bashing his vehicle in, and in the attempt to escape, Hitting people and killing one and getting a life sentence, is that worse?
[00:56:05.845 --> 00:56:15.787]  Or is targeting a specific individual that you know is a conservative to run him over with your car and then doing so, which is worse?
[00:56:17.687 --> 00:56:24.009]  Well, anybody who's being obvious, or anyone who's being honest here, obviously the situation with Brandt is much worse.
[00:56:25.229 --> 00:56:25.669]  Much worse.
[00:56:27.549 --> 00:56:29.990]  But who do you think is going to have the bigger punishment?
[00:56:33.416 --> 00:56:38.200]  So far, indications are Brandt is going to get a very nice sentence here.
[00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:39.981]  He's going to get a very nice deal.
[00:56:40.221 --> 00:56:41.743]  He's already been released from jail.
[00:56:43.324 --> 00:56:44.905]  Pretty amazing stuff, isn't it?
[00:56:48.168 --> 00:56:50.329]  And everybody knows this is what's going on.
[00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:52.411]  Here's Kelly Paul on Twitter.
[00:56:53.669 --> 00:57:00.832]  Yesterday, since Lee Zeldin stabbing, remember Republican governor of New York candidate, Democrat tried to stab him to death, you know.
[00:57:01.232 --> 00:57:03.633]  A Democrat official stabbed a journalist to death, remember that?
[00:57:03.673 --> 00:57:06.454]  A Democrat just murdered a journalist a couple weeks ago, didn't get covered.
[00:57:07.515 --> 00:57:09.395]  And a teen Republican was murdered by a leftist.
[00:57:09.755 --> 00:57:14.918]  In Louisville, the mayor was assaulted and a candidate was shot by a leftist.
[00:57:15.318 --> 00:57:18.039]  Democrats justify the assault on my husband every day.
[00:57:18.619 --> 00:57:19.319]  Evil abounds.
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:23.441]  Yeah, when are we going to accept the fact that liberal Democrats are the extremist group?
[00:57:23.721 --> 00:57:41.650]  You know, the only answer, I think, to this madness that we are enduring, that we are being subjected to by the American left, is, folks, Americans just have to wake up and be honest, and get into leadership roles, and we just have to stop playing games with these goons.
[00:57:42.450 --> 00:57:46.372]  We have to stop electing these goons, we have to stop putting these goons in classrooms.
[00:57:47.132 --> 00:57:47.773]  They're goons.
[00:57:49.133 --> 00:57:50.174]  And they're psychotic.
[00:57:51.394 --> 00:57:57.324]   Just look at what they do to children, Just look at what they've done to the legal system.
[00:57:57.344 --> 00:58:00.487]  I mean, just look at what they've done to the country!
[00:58:03.088 --> 00:58:13.536]  So, I don't know how bad it has to get for Americans to finally wake up and stand against this radical left-wing fascism, which, again, it's like we didn't learn from the 20th century.
[00:58:14.517 --> 00:58:22.643]  We didn't learn from all the left-wing ideologies of the 21st century that resulted in millions dead.
[00:58:24.619 --> 00:58:26.240]  The left-wing ideology of Lenin.
[00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:28.320]  The left-wing ideology of Stalin.
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:30.601]  The left-wing ideology of Mao.
[00:58:30.781 --> 00:58:32.362]  The left-wing ideology of Hitler.
[00:58:33.222 --> 00:58:36.703]  Did we not learn from the 20th century about what the left-wing ideology does?
[00:58:38.303 --> 00:58:46.486]  How many people have to die in the 21st century in the West to learn how deadly left-wing ideology is?
[00:58:46.926 --> 00:58:51.788]  To learn how deadly socialism and communism are?
[00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:55.081]  How many people have to die?
[00:58:55.361 --> 00:58:57.482]  Do we really have to learn this lesson again?
[00:58:57.902 --> 00:59:04.406]  Did we really not learn enough with 200 million people dead because of the left-wing ideology?
[00:59:05.466 --> 00:59:07.007]  Did we really not learn enough?
[00:59:10.048 --> 00:59:12.608]  Here's an example as they put that graphic on screen.
[00:59:12.608 --> 00:59:20.449]  I've got it somewhere in my stacks of news here.
[00:59:20.354 --> 00:59:27.354]  I've got so much damn news.
[00:59:27.354 --> 00:59:35.514]   There was, here it is, there was an active shooter lockdown yesterday at San Antonio
[00:59:35.514 --> 00:59:37.274]  High School, Jefferson High.
[00:59:37.233 --> 00:59:53.225]  And in fact, quickly before I get to the point here, we have footage of this where parents tried to intervene so that their kids didn't get killed like they did at Uvalde when the cops stood down and the parents got arrested.
[00:59:53.285 --> 00:59:55.627]  Here's that in clip five.
[00:59:57.897 --> 01:00:07.897]  [NOISE]
[01:00:07.897 --> 01:00:17.897]  [INAUDIBLE]
[01:00:35.097 --> 01:00:38.697]   Parents obviously upset that the cops are going after the parent here.
[01:00:38.697 --> 01:00:40.197]  I'll give you my number, you can send it to me.
[01:00:40.197 --> 01:00:43.197]  [INAUDIBLE]
[01:00:43.262 --> 01:00:45.922]  Now, okay well that's one story.
[01:00:47.623 --> 01:00:53.144]  Yeah, can you blame those parents for wanting to intervene after what happened in Uvalde and the stand down?
[01:00:53.784 --> 01:00:54.444]  Can you blame them?
[01:00:56.018 --> 01:00:58.459]  But that's not even really the point I want to make here.
[01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:07.004]  Ladies and gentlemen, there should never be another active shooter situation at a school again in this country.
[01:01:07.084 --> 01:01:07.905]  It should never happen again.
[01:01:07.925 --> 01:01:09.166]  It should not happen.
[01:01:10.386 --> 01:01:11.207]  And I know how to stop it.
[01:01:13.068 --> 01:01:33.637]   If you have one, just one, I mean, it could be someone out of the military, it could be someone out of the police force, it could be some other specialist training, If you have one trained armed guard on the schoolyard at all times, this won't happen.
[01:01:34.938 --> 01:01:36.699]  Why is that so hard to understand?
[01:01:37.639 --> 01:01:39.280]  Why do we have armed security at banks?
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:43.742]  So that a bank robber doesn't show up with a gun and rob the bank.
[01:01:44.482 --> 01:01:47.063]  Well, okay, that's pretty common sense, isn't it?
[01:01:48.704 --> 01:01:51.425]  So why don't we have armed guards at schools?
[01:01:52.806 --> 01:01:54.507]  Or do we value money more than children?
[01:01:58.044 --> 01:02:01.086]  As you're watching footage from the Uvalde stand-down in the school.
[01:02:02.728 --> 01:02:11.094]  Now, police might have their tactics, and they might have their beliefs, and they might have, oh well, we should do this, or we should do this, and again, I'm not even arguing that.
[01:02:13.095 --> 01:02:14.396]  Everybody knows what happened at Uvalde.
[01:02:17.919 --> 01:02:23.063]  There should never be another active school shooter ever again in this country.
[01:02:23.563 --> 01:02:25.565]  And we all know how to stop the problem.
[01:02:26.590 --> 01:02:27.951]  And why can't we accomplish that?
[01:02:29.031 --> 01:02:29.932]  Because Democrats.
[01:02:31.132 --> 01:02:35.694]  Because Democrats are more enthused to disarm the population.
[01:02:36.655 --> 01:02:39.356]  What's the last thing that happens before you become a slave?
[01:02:39.816 --> 01:02:40.677]  You get disarmed.
[01:02:42.717 --> 01:02:44.818]  And Democrats are more concerned with that.
[01:02:45.259 --> 01:02:52.222]  They're more concerned with their agenda to take your guns so they can tell you how to live your life and enslave you and eventually murder you.
[01:02:53.697 --> 01:02:56.359]  Just like the left-wing ideology has done throughout human history.
[01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:59.182]  They take your guns and then they murder you.
[01:03:00.603 --> 01:03:02.204]  Again, 20th century history.
[01:03:02.384 --> 01:03:02.865]  Look it up.
[01:03:04.266 --> 01:03:06.568]  Liberals must have skipped history class.
[01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:25.190]   You put a well-trained military man, a well-trained policeman who's an expert in marksmanship and firearms and combat There will never be another active school shooter situation.
[01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:31.871]  If a school shooter shows up, that trained guard will have them down and neutralized.
[01:03:31.891 --> 01:03:33.832]  I mean, what should we say?
[01:03:33.892 --> 01:03:34.732]  Ten minutes max?
[01:03:34.872 --> 01:03:35.212]  Five?
[01:03:35.252 --> 01:03:36.032]  Probably less?
[01:03:39.773 --> 01:03:42.853]  I mean, I guarantee you, there's military men listening to this show right now.
[01:03:43.174 --> 01:03:45.574]  There's people listening who have friends and family in the military.
[01:03:45.814 --> 01:03:47.054]  I've got plenty of military buddies.
[01:03:48.015 --> 01:04:00.868]   I know for a fact That the military guys I know, if it was their job to protect a school shooter, to protect a school from a shooter, that school shooter would be neutralized quickly.
[01:04:01.249 --> 01:04:04.391]  And they would be very enthused to take up that role.
[01:04:05.872 --> 01:04:09.815]  They'd be very enthused to protect those kids.
[01:04:10.856 --> 01:04:13.098]  And they would put their body on the line to do it.
[01:04:14.839 --> 01:04:15.980]  So why aren't we doing this?
[01:04:17.481 --> 01:04:25.427]  Again, because the Democrat agenda to take your guns is more important than protecting children in schools.
[01:04:28.089 --> 01:04:31.491]  And when you understand that, you understand their entire ideology.
[01:04:32.552 --> 01:04:38.396]  It's politics first, politics second, politics third, politics fourth, and all the way down the line.
[01:04:38.777 --> 01:04:42.219]  Nothing else exists in their mind except politics.
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:46.963]  And their agenda to dominate you with their politics.
[01:04:48.871 --> 01:04:52.194]  There should never be another active school shooter in this country ever again.
[01:04:53.395 --> 01:04:55.677]  We could easily have an armed guard at every school well trained.
[01:04:56.057 --> 01:04:56.457]  Easily.
[01:04:58.019 --> 01:04:58.399]  Easily.
[01:04:58.419 --> 01:04:59.880]  How about this?
[01:05:00.981 --> 01:05:07.266]  How many special operations military men are in Ukraine right now?
[01:05:09.128 --> 01:05:12.811]  Probably hundreds of Americans killing Russians in Ukraine right now.
[01:05:14.329 --> 01:05:16.151]  What do you think's more important?
[01:05:16.691 --> 01:05:18.372]  Them going over there to kill Russians?
[01:05:18.913 --> 01:05:21.034]  Or them being here to protect our schools?
[01:05:21.915 --> 01:05:22.936]  What do you think's more important?
[01:05:26.038 --> 01:05:29.261]  What do you think would be a better use of their skill?
[01:05:29.281 --> 01:05:34.004]  What do you think would be a better use of their skill for America?
[01:05:35.105 --> 01:05:38.588]  Sending them over to more wars that have nothing to do with the people of this country?
[01:05:39.929 --> 01:05:47.169]   Or putting their skills to work in schools So that there never is another mass shooting in this country.
[01:05:48.561 --> 01:05:53.962]  But see, we live in the clown world, so we send military and weapons to kill Russians, not protect our kids.
[01:05:54.923 --> 01:05:59.664]  Alright, we got a dementia-ridden president who's doing nothing to stop World War III from breaking out.
[01:06:00.504 --> 01:06:10.487]  We've got doctors and teachers and strippers and hookers teaching little boys and girls how to have sex and perform oral sex and then using them for their own sexual fetishes.
[01:06:11.247 --> 01:06:15.368]  Hopefully they can convince them to go to a doctor to chop their balls off or their breasts off.
[01:06:16.465 --> 01:06:27.772]  We have radicalized Democrats murdering Republicans in the streets, going to Supreme Court Justice's house to kill them, trying to do mass shootings at Republican baseball practices.
[01:06:29.173 --> 01:06:31.054]  How much longer does this go on?
[01:06:32.455 --> 01:06:34.857]  How much longer do we have to deal with this?
[01:06:37.639 --> 01:06:38.399]  Man, oh man.
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:39.480]  I'll tell ya.
[01:06:41.321 --> 01:06:41.941]  I'll tell ya.
[01:06:42.162 --> 01:06:44.143]  It is a truly dark time we're in.
[01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:56.612]  Right now, with the ideology of the left, continuing to plague this planet like a cancer, killing anyone it infects.
[01:06:58.793 --> 01:07:00.833]  Have we learned nothing from the 20th century?
[01:07:02.994 --> 01:07:03.894]  Really sad stuff.
[01:07:05.374 --> 01:07:15.430]   Really heartbreaking stuff that a once great nation, a once great people, a once free society, prosperous, innovative, inventive, United.
[01:07:15.530 --> 01:07:16.190]  Diverse.
[01:07:17.691 --> 01:07:20.391]  Is now being turned into another third world hellhole.
[01:07:22.072 --> 01:07:24.392]  Leftist blood bank.
[01:07:26.433 --> 01:07:27.653]  Where they chop up babies.
[01:07:27.673 --> 01:07:28.593]  Did you see the latest one?
[01:07:29.954 --> 01:07:33.135]  Where they're now denying that a baby has a heartbeat at six weeks.
[01:07:34.895 --> 01:07:36.655]  They just love killing babies, don't they?
[01:07:37.356 --> 01:07:39.556]  Well yeah, they have a left-wing ideology.
[01:07:39.716 --> 01:07:40.896]  Death is their friend.
[01:07:41.537 --> 01:07:42.817]  They love death.
[01:07:47.412 --> 01:07:47.752]  Stunning.
[01:07:47.932 --> 01:07:50.493]  Just, just, just truly stunning.
[01:07:54.474 --> 01:07:59.736]  It's hard, it's really hard to go on at all intellectually when you know that this is the world that you live in.
[01:08:00.636 --> 01:08:04.217]  And you know that, and that's the whole point of communism, isn't it?
[01:08:06.058 --> 01:08:12.360]  It's to completely degrade you and destroy you so that you just give up.
[01:08:13.365 --> 01:08:13.966]  What's the point?
[01:08:14.246 --> 01:08:16.067]  The government's just going to take it all from me anyway.
[01:08:16.388 --> 01:08:16.968]  What's the point?
[01:08:17.168 --> 01:08:18.549]  The government runs my life anyway.
[01:08:19.870 --> 01:08:20.651]  What's the point of anything?
[01:08:20.671 --> 01:08:34.843]  So you just give up and society collapses and civilization collapses and then the very tyrants that caused it to collapse go out and murder all the people that stand against it.
[01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:41.432]  That is, the left-wing ideology of communism and socialism practiced every time to its conclusion.
[01:08:41.993 --> 01:08:42.293]  Every.
[01:08:42.933 --> 01:08:43.374]  Single.
[01:08:43.954 --> 01:08:44.274]  Time.
[01:08:45.975 --> 01:08:46.716]  It's pretty obvious.
[01:08:47.576 --> 01:08:56.141]  We know what the conclusion of the right-wing ideology is, the most prosperous free nation in the history of this planet, where everybody across the world rushes to come here.
[01:08:57.142 --> 01:09:00.064]  That's what the conclusion of the right-wing ideology accomplished.
[01:09:01.627 --> 01:09:05.368]  Now we're going the opposite way, and we're reaching the conclusion of the left-wing ideology.
[01:09:05.928 --> 01:09:10.128]  Poverty, homelessness, oppression, and death.
[01:09:14.309 --> 01:09:18.550]  So... That's where we are.
[01:09:20.350 --> 01:09:28.072]  And... It's just, it's just... I don't know if I can do it anymore, man.
[01:09:28.492 --> 01:09:30.392]  I may need to just take a break or play a video clip.
[01:09:32.036 --> 01:09:33.962]  It's just too heavy doing this for six hours a day.
[01:09:34.966 --> 01:09:35.768]  So let's just do this.
[01:09:36.049 --> 01:09:36.511]  Let's go to...
[01:09:38.666 --> 01:09:45.410]  Let's go to Marjorie Taylor Greene being harassed by reporters outside of Congress, which I'm glad this is happening, by the way.
[01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:46.750]  They're all trying to be Alex Stein.
[01:09:47.090 --> 01:09:53.734]  The difference is Marjorie Taylor Greene actually stands there and talks to them because she's not a coward.
[01:09:54.114 --> 01:10:02.579]  So here's the brave leader Marjorie Taylor Greene talking to mainstream media jackals on the Capitol steps in clip 14.
[01:10:03.968 --> 01:10:06.992]  About Christian nationalism?
[01:10:07.012 --> 01:10:10.456]  About Christianity and love in our country?
[01:10:10.817 --> 01:10:15.162]  So, that is how you interpret Christian nationalism?
[01:10:15.021 --> 01:10:23.021]   So, in that, I understand that, as much as the definition of it is something divisional.
[01:10:23.021 --> 01:10:27.021]   I don't know any other definition, and I have no idea what you're talking about.
[01:10:27.737 --> 01:10:33.576]   To me it just means having a Christian faith or Judeo-Christian principles, which are a
[01:10:33.576 --> 01:10:40.056]   founding principles for our country, and just loving our country, wanting our tax dollars
[01:10:40.056 --> 01:10:44.296]  and our policies here just to simply serve Americans.
[01:10:44.296 --> 01:10:47.256]  And that's it.
[01:10:47.256 --> 01:10:48.856]  There's nothing else to add to it.
[01:10:48.856 --> 01:10:49.896]  Just simply that.
[01:10:49.896 --> 01:11:02.456]  [inaudible]
[01:11:02.525 --> 01:11:05.146]  No, that's not how this country is set up.
[01:11:05.186 --> 01:11:17.311]  We have religious freedom in America, which is a wonderful thing, but I do want to remind you that you see the words of God we trust in a lot of places inside that health chamber.
[01:11:17.351 --> 01:11:19.211]  But he doesn't say Jesus.
[01:11:19.311 --> 01:11:20.592]  I didn't say Jesus.
[01:11:20.692 --> 01:11:24.113]  I didn't say, and I said in America we have freedom of religion.
[01:11:24.213 --> 01:11:27.635]  But most Republicans believe in Judeo-Christianism.
[01:11:28.095 --> 01:11:32.655]  values and religious beliefs and we love our country.
[01:11:32.655 --> 01:11:34.774]   These aren't bad things, these are good things for everybody.
[01:11:34.774 --> 01:11:41.614]   So what do you say to people who believe that by, Christian nationalism has a specific definition?
[01:11:41.614 --> 01:11:45.574]   I don't wanna have anything to do with anything racist or
[01:11:45.574 --> 01:11:49.654]   anything that's not theism, cuz I think those things are horrific.
[01:11:49.654 --> 01:11:52.293]  So Tia, please do not twist up my words.
[01:11:52.293 --> 01:11:54.855]   And that's why I'm not, and that's why I wanna give you a chance to clarify.
[01:11:54.855 --> 01:11:59.175]   I've already clearly said it on this recording and it is not anything different.
[01:11:59.175 --> 01:12:01.935]   So we'll give you a chance to clarify, as if we haven't had to clarify all of
[01:12:01.935 --> 01:12:04.494]  this hundreds of times over and over, they just keep lying.
[01:12:04.494 --> 01:12:06.494]  [END]
[01:12:06.653 --> 01:12:07.895]  Who gets to say what words mean?
[01:12:07.755 --> 01:12:09.755]  knowing that that's what that means.
[01:12:09.755 --> 01:12:11.755]  I don't know anything bad about the mission.
[01:12:11.755 --> 01:12:13.755]  Who gets to say what words mean?
[01:12:13.755 --> 01:12:15.755]  I'm asking her.
[01:12:15.755 --> 01:12:17.755]  I don't know who labeled that something bad.
[01:12:17.755 --> 01:12:19.755]  Are you going by Wikipedia or what?
[01:12:19.755 --> 01:12:21.755]  I don't know.
[01:12:21.755 --> 01:12:23.755]  I don't know what organization labeled that bad.
[01:12:24.497 --> 01:12:27.841]  You know, the word MAGA has been made into something bad.
[01:12:27.961 --> 01:12:30.084]  They're saying MAGA Republicans.
[01:12:30.424 --> 01:12:33.188]  MAGA means Make America Great Again.
[01:12:33.588 --> 01:12:36.252]  There's nothing dangerous about that.
[01:12:36.292 --> 01:12:38.134]  There's nothing terrifying about that.
[01:12:38.174 --> 01:12:39.556]  There's nothing bad about that.
[01:12:39.736 --> 01:12:49.647]  That is good for every single American, regardless of identity, political party, and whatever they choose they are, whatever kind of life they live.
[01:12:49.968 --> 01:12:54.453]  Make America Great Again simply means having a great country and for all to see.
[01:12:55.613 --> 01:13:13.060]  So these definitions that leftist groups or media companies, who are really, a lot of them are political activists, that are Democrat political activists, that want to take terms that I say, like Christian nationalism and what other people say, and try to turn it into something evil or bad, I completely reject that.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:22.544]  I am simply saying, having Judeo-Christian beliefs, being proud of your faith in God, loving your country, these are wonderful things, and these are things that we should all care about.
[01:13:23.004 --> 01:13:24.644]  Do you consider yourself a social person?
[01:13:24.724 --> 01:13:26.165]  What does that mean to you?
[01:13:26.185 --> 01:13:27.745]  Do you think you're a social person?
[01:13:27.765 --> 01:13:29.526]  Sure, I like talking to you all the time.
[01:13:29.586 --> 01:13:31.066]  So do you call yourself a socialist?
[01:13:31.546 --> 01:13:35.687]  Okay, this is ridiculous!
[01:13:35.727 --> 01:13:40.048]  But you just actually just said, what is the definition of socialist?
[01:13:40.088 --> 01:13:41.548]  Do we just call yourself a socialist?
[01:13:41.568 --> 01:13:43.769]  Okay, now, what is your definition of socialist?
[01:13:43.809 --> 01:13:45.069]  I'm asking socialism.
[01:13:45.169 --> 01:13:47.310]  Alright, what's going on?
[01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:55.833]  I'm going to have to put this video out and prove to people how stupid your question just was.
[01:13:55.913 --> 01:13:57.334]  They're stupid liberals.
[01:13:57.414 --> 01:13:58.354]  They're dumb.
[01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:02.256]  Tia, do yourself a favor and ask normal questions.
[01:14:02.296 --> 01:14:06.878]  Don't make a fool of yourself for taking a big reach like that.
[01:14:06.958 --> 01:14:07.838]  Are you social?
[01:14:08.318 --> 01:14:08.859]  I'm social.
[01:14:08.879 --> 01:14:09.699]  I like talking to people.
[01:14:09.819 --> 01:14:12.020]  Are you a socialist?
[01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:14.521]  Folks, I'm going to tell you something here.
[01:14:16.015 --> 01:14:26.799]  There's one thing the Founding Fathers were way right on that we went way wrong on, and that's basically IQ tests to have any power and influence in society.
[01:14:26.919 --> 01:14:29.280]  I mean, it's clear now that they were right on about that.
[01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:33.582]  If you're so stupid, you shouldn't be allowed to vote, probably.
[01:14:34.622 --> 01:14:47.267]   Now, of course, you'll be called an extremist and everything under the book if you suggest going back to that or saying women shouldn't be allowed to vote or all this stuff, but I mean, look, Look at what's happened to this country since we've let stupid people vote.
[01:14:48.108 --> 01:14:56.793]  Look at what's happened to this country since we've let stupid people graduate from college, and stupid people get all these jobs where they don't belong, like in media.
[01:14:57.913 --> 01:15:00.395]  We're now dominated by stupid people.
[01:15:00.715 --> 01:15:05.938]  Stupid people are running our country, stupid people are in positions of power, and they're destroying the country.
[01:15:05.978 --> 01:15:06.719]  But see, here's the thing.
[01:15:07.159 --> 01:15:07.859]  I'd love to see it.
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:10.121]  Why can't liberals and conservatives just agree?
[01:15:10.461 --> 01:15:13.323]  Hey, you leave us alone, we leave you alone.
[01:15:14.708 --> 01:15:18.769]  Ah, conservatives have been asking liberals to leave us alone forever.
[01:15:19.509 --> 01:15:20.149]  And they won't do it.
[01:15:20.549 --> 01:15:21.449]  They can't leave us alone.
[01:15:21.490 --> 01:15:22.310]  They're obsessed with us.
[01:15:22.350 --> 01:15:23.670]  They want to tell us what to do all the time.
[01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:26.010]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:28.151 --> 01:15:36.373]  We are in a very interesting situation here at InfoWars where we've been marked for destruction.
[01:15:36.573 --> 01:15:37.813]  We've been marked for death.
[01:15:38.553 --> 01:15:42.194]  The total censorship didn't wipe us out, so now they're trying to wipe us out with lawfare.
[01:15:44.888 --> 01:15:50.132]  In a way, it's a battle of futility, except that just being on air is a victory every day.
[01:15:52.053 --> 01:16:01.859]  But, at a certain point, and you look at how much it costs, the cost of just being on air every day, and it's, honestly, it's overwhelming, folks.
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:03.460]  It's overwhelming.
[01:16:04.921 --> 01:16:12.466]  And it's really a miracle that we're still able to operate, be on air, and we have not had to let go of a single crew member.
[01:16:13.356 --> 01:16:14.037]  That is a miracle.
[01:16:14.497 --> 01:16:16.519]  We've not had to scale down our live transmissions.
[01:16:16.559 --> 01:16:28.208]  We've not had to scale down banned out video where we host dozens of other hosts and creators and artists and reporters and musicians.
[01:16:30.650 --> 01:16:31.371]  And that's a miracle.
[01:16:31.571 --> 01:16:33.693]  And that's thanks to your support at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:16:33.753 --> 01:16:34.273]  I mean, that's it.
[01:16:34.594 --> 01:16:36.375]  If it wasn't for you, we wouldn't be here.
[01:16:37.716 --> 01:17:00.865]   But it's almost like Again, if the victory wasn't us just being on air, Alex probably would have shut this place down a long time ago, just because of how much it costs to run it, and then just the labor to run it as well, dealing with all the attacks against us by the fascistic communists every day.
[01:17:01.966 --> 01:17:03.107]  You see us in court all the time.
[01:17:03.687 --> 01:17:04.428]  I'm in court all the time.
[01:17:04.608 --> 01:17:05.429]  Alex is in court all the time.
[01:17:06.349 --> 01:17:07.410]  All of us are censored everywhere.
[01:17:09.932 --> 01:17:17.872]   So at a certain point, you're just kind of just like, well, I mean, Do I keep going or do I just let Darth Vader strike me down for the world to see?
[01:17:19.333 --> 01:17:22.336]  But we're going to keep going as long as you keep supporting us, and you have.
[01:17:22.776 --> 01:17:27.520]  And so we're still here, we've still got the whole entire great crew, we're still live ten hours a day minimum.
[01:17:29.201 --> 01:17:46.764]   And the two big things that have really funded us in going into this fall, knowing we can still be on air this fall for the midterms, and that's the new book The Great Reset and the War for the World by Alex Jones.
[01:17:49.065 --> 01:17:50.585]  Here's a copy right here on my desk.
[01:17:52.926 --> 01:17:54.706]  Just, folks, this thing reads like a textbook.
[01:17:54.726 --> 01:17:59.247]  I'm telling you, if you want just the blueprint, if you just want the knowledge, the information, this is it.
[01:17:59.307 --> 01:18:01.088]  Chapter 1, What is the Great Reset?
[01:18:01.128 --> 01:18:03.708]  Chapter 2, Developing the System of Control.
[01:18:05.229 --> 01:18:06.609]  It just goes on and on.
[01:18:07.909 --> 01:18:12.153]   And it reads like A textbook, folks.
[01:18:13.054 --> 01:18:26.944]  And if you go to the back, you'll see bibliography here that just sources all of everything that's in the book.
[01:18:27.264 --> 01:18:30.206]  I mean, the bibliography is almost as long as the book itself!
[01:18:33.728 --> 01:18:34.329]  Just amazing.
[01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:40.053]  Get your copy right now at InfoWarsTore.com or on Amazon.
[01:18:42.631 --> 01:18:45.253]  If you get it on our websites, all of that goes directly to us.
[01:18:45.293 --> 01:18:46.813]  If you get it to Amazon, they take their cut.
[01:18:46.934 --> 01:18:50.115]  But the book stays on top of the top seller charts.
[01:18:50.175 --> 01:18:51.336]  So it has an advantage there.
[01:18:52.417 --> 01:18:54.358]  The Great Reset and the World for the World by Alex Jones.
[01:18:54.398 --> 01:18:54.978]  Get your book.
[01:18:55.078 --> 01:18:55.959]  That keeps us on air.
[01:18:56.019 --> 01:18:56.739]  Give it away as gifts.
[01:18:57.279 --> 01:18:58.340]  And the new coin.
[01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:00.541]  These are always great fundraisers.
[01:19:01.642 --> 01:19:04.023]  There's a big markup on this, but it's a piece of history.
[01:19:04.123 --> 01:19:05.584]  It's a pure silver coin.
[01:19:05.704 --> 01:19:06.745]  It has collector's value.
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:15.063]  So, the new, only $10,000 in mint, Teddy Roosevelt Man in the Arena coin, also available at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:21.146]  When you click that at InfowarsStore.com, that will directly link you to 1776coin.com, where you can make your purchase.
[01:19:21.586 --> 01:19:26.429]  These two items are the key fundraisers right now to keep us on the air.
[01:19:27.749 --> 01:19:35.870]   And folks, I'm just going to be honest with you here, I think Alex is at the point where If the funds stop coming in, he's just gonna shut it down and he's not even gonna have any qualms about it.
[01:19:36.271 --> 01:19:40.613]  Because of just all the torment and all the torture and all the toil and all the labor that goes in.
[01:19:40.653 --> 01:19:41.614]  And it's a labor of love!
[01:19:43.513 --> 01:19:46.574]  But it's just like, it would almost be a relief for him at this point.
[01:19:47.234 --> 01:19:51.796]  But as long as you keep supporting us financially, and we are able to stay on air, we're going to do it.
[01:19:52.437 --> 01:19:58.179]  So continue to shop at InfoWarsStore.com, and we will continue to have the victory of just being on air.
[01:19:59.059 --> 01:20:04.481]  It's like a bonus that we're probably the best news organization out there, but just being on air is the victory.
[01:20:04.561 --> 01:20:04.902]  All right.
[01:20:05.802 --> 01:20:07.643]  Josh Hawley is doing a great job.
[01:20:08.883 --> 01:20:18.908]  As a congressman, and here he is on, in the Capitol yesterday, schooling a National Archivist of Biden that is a complete disaster.
[01:20:18.968 --> 01:20:19.328]  Here it is.
[01:20:19.348 --> 01:20:23.590]  Republicans tend to exhibit anti-intellectual qualities.
[01:20:24.050 --> 01:20:28.732]  Democrats, on the other hand, coalesce on the intellectual tail of the continuum.
[01:20:28.892 --> 01:20:32.874]  So is the point that Republicans are stupid and Democrats are intellectual?
[01:20:33.622 --> 01:20:34.883]  Thank you, Senator, for that question.
[01:20:35.243 --> 01:20:36.024]  Absolutely not.
[01:20:36.464 --> 01:20:45.331]  The point of the article is that the presidents that I featured in it have a rhetorical connection with the American people.
[01:20:45.351 --> 01:20:49.133]  A rhetorical connection that you say is anti-intellectual?
[01:20:49.534 --> 01:20:54.057]  And you feature every two-term Republican president, going back to Dwight Eisenhower.
[01:20:55.198 --> 01:21:06.990]   Yes, Senator, I think it's a piece on rhetoric and it is really Looking at how these presidents have been successful rhetorically in their arguments.
[01:21:08.211 --> 01:21:08.651]  Interesting.
[01:21:08.691 --> 01:21:15.778]  It's a piece on rhetoric, but you attribute part of the anti-intellectualism of the Republican Party to, in your words, the rise of the religious right.
[01:21:16.498 --> 01:21:17.199]  Tell me about that.
[01:21:17.259 --> 01:21:18.740]  Is it because those voters are stupid?
[01:21:19.841 --> 01:21:20.882]  Thank you, Senator, for that question.
[01:21:21.102 --> 01:21:21.863]  Absolutely not.
[01:21:22.343 --> 01:21:28.269]  And if I am confirmed as Archivist of the United States, I look forward to welcoming all Americans to the National Archives.
[01:21:29.056 --> 01:21:32.299]  So do you think that people who voted for Donald Trump are anti-intellectual?
[01:21:32.319 --> 01:21:34.561]  The truth is that Democrats are the dumb ones.
[01:21:34.701 --> 01:21:38.424]  I've proved that with hundreds of hours of interviews interviewing liberals out on the streets.
[01:21:38.805 --> 01:21:40.446]  But notice how this is another ghoul.
[01:21:40.786 --> 01:21:44.570]  Why do all of Biden's appointees look like damn ghouls?
[01:21:44.610 --> 01:21:47.492]  The anti-intellectual rhetoric just appealed to them because what?
[01:21:47.692 --> 01:21:48.253]  What's your theory?
[01:21:49.294 --> 01:21:50.355]  Thank you, Senator, for that question.
[01:21:50.515 --> 01:21:56.020]  As I said, presidents are able to speak in common sense, plain terms to Americans that they understand.
[01:21:57.265 --> 01:22:02.927]  So, you characterize President Reagan as having, quote, less than impressive intellectual capacities.
[01:22:03.687 --> 01:22:07.908]  You said President Eisenhower and Bush were decidedly intellectual.
[01:22:08.188 --> 01:22:11.489]  You said Reagan engaged in intellectual posturing.
[01:22:11.969 --> 01:22:12.969]  Let's just start with the first one.
[01:22:13.149 --> 01:22:15.210]  Less than impressive intellectual capacities.
[01:22:15.450 --> 01:22:16.670]  So, in other words, it's dumb?
[01:22:17.210 --> 01:22:17.791]  Thank you, Senator.
[01:22:17.971 --> 01:22:18.831]  Absolutely not.
[01:22:19.011 --> 01:22:21.012]  That was a perception, and it was cited.
[01:22:22.152 --> 01:22:24.292]  I'm sorry, it's a perception by whom?
[01:22:24.492 --> 01:22:24.873]  By you?
[01:22:25.113 --> 01:22:26.193]  You wrote about it.
[01:22:27.034 --> 01:22:27.676]  No, Senator.
[01:22:27.937 --> 01:22:34.516]  That was, and as I said in the article, that is a perception, but actually in the article...
[01:22:35.731 --> 01:22:41.395]  Because... You say Reagan's less than impressive intellectual capacities have been widely discussed.
[01:22:41.955 --> 01:22:43.996]  That's presented as a factual statement.
[01:22:44.396 --> 01:22:45.517]  You don't even cite for it.
[01:22:46.097 --> 01:22:46.938]  This is on page 298.
[01:22:47.518 --> 01:22:48.979]  I have your article.
[01:22:49.039 --> 01:22:50.580]  Don't dissemble in front of me.
[01:22:51.221 --> 01:22:55.383]  So, Reagan's less than impressive intellectual capacities have been widely discussed.
[01:22:55.923 --> 01:22:58.065]  You're not saying that he had less than... That's not your view?
[01:22:58.745 --> 01:22:59.286]  Thank you, Senator.
[01:22:59.386 --> 01:23:00.206]  It is not my view.
[01:23:00.586 --> 01:23:01.227]  Why did you write it?
[01:23:02.227 --> 01:23:02.687]  Thank you, Senator.
[01:23:03.027 --> 01:23:04.088]  That is not my view.
[01:23:04.128 --> 01:23:07.709]  My view was focused on his rhetorical capability.
[01:23:07.729 --> 01:23:08.829]  That's not what your sentence says.
[01:23:08.889 --> 01:23:17.572]  Listen, you wrote an article saying basically that Republican voters are stupid, that Republican presidents deliberately appeal to anti-intellectualism.
[01:23:17.692 --> 01:23:24.574]  You roll it all up in this thing called Republican populism, yet you're trying to present yourself here as a nonpartisan.
[01:23:25.114 --> 01:23:28.595]  In fact, you're an extreme partisan, and your record shows that.
[01:23:29.135 --> 01:23:34.359]   You're someone who has denigrated Republican presidents every Two-term Republican president, I think.
[01:23:34.379 --> 01:23:36.181]  I hope I'm not leaving anybody out.
[01:23:37.163 --> 01:23:42.269]  That has, since the Second World War, and their voters, in this lengthy article.
[01:23:42.289 --> 01:23:45.233]  I just don't understand, if you wrote it, why won't you stand behind it?
[01:23:46.598 --> 01:23:47.118]  Thank you, Senator.
[01:23:47.699 --> 01:23:54.083]  I will stand by my long experience over 15 years of non-partisan service.
[01:23:54.403 --> 01:24:05.010]  You know, this is not just a theoretical set of questions, because as you know, we have seen what happens when you have political activists in the position that you are up for confirmation for.
[01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:07.872]  And we are living through that as a nation right now.
[01:24:08.393 --> 01:24:24.786]  We are living through the weaponization, the political weaponization of the National Archives, the political weaponization of the Department of Justice, the political weaponization of the FBI, such that half of the people of this country cannot trust those institutions.
[01:24:25.127 --> 01:24:33.274]  We're living with a president who calls half the voters of this country semi-fascists, who have said that they are a threat to democracy.
[01:24:33.874 --> 01:24:40.510]  This is an elected American president who makes these outrageous, outrageous statements.
[01:24:41.522 --> 01:24:51.109]  So in that environment, frankly, to have you up for confirmation for this position, which has become very politically charged, in a way I lament it should not have been.
[01:24:51.189 --> 01:24:54.552]  But unfortunately, the past archivists have done what they've done.
[01:24:54.612 --> 01:24:55.993]  The FBI has done what it has done.
[01:24:56.053 --> 01:24:57.454]  DOJ has done what they have done.
[01:24:57.614 --> 01:25:03.339]  And here you are talking about the anti-intellectualism and, frankly, stupidity of American voters.
[01:25:03.999 --> 01:25:06.702]  I mean, if that isn't playing to type, I don't know what that world is.
[01:25:06.902 --> 01:25:08.523]  I mean, it's basically a self-parody.
[01:25:08.944 --> 01:25:23.738]  How can you assure me, or anybody watching this hearing, the millions of Americans, 75 million Americans who voted for a Republican in the last election, how can you assure them that you will be truly non-partisan, given what you have said over a period of years?
[01:25:24.718 --> 01:25:25.378]  Thank you, Senator.
[01:25:26.099 --> 01:25:37.942]  I stand by my record of nonpartisan service at the Congressional Research Service, the Library of Congress, and at the White House Historical Association, and I invite anybody to talk to the people that I work with.
[01:25:37.962 --> 01:25:46.385]  So the question is, with great people like Tucker Carlson and Josh Hawley on the rise, once they destroy Infowars and all of us here, how is America going to respond when they go after Hawley and Carlson?
[01:25:46.204 --> 01:25:59.204]  Because they're coming next.
[01:26:00.017 --> 01:26:01.677]  And today is do or die time.
[01:26:02.738 --> 01:26:07.919]  If InfoWars gets the funding, end of the midterms, end of next year, we're going to stay on air and be more effective than ever.
[01:26:08.199 --> 01:26:14.720]  But if we don't, I respect your decision and I'm ready to basically implode and shut down our main operations.
[01:26:15.341 --> 01:26:16.981]  I've done my work.
[01:26:17.141 --> 01:26:18.721]  I've put everything into it.
[01:26:18.761 --> 01:26:19.541]  I'm leaving it all in the field.
[01:26:20.122 --> 01:26:26.115]   But I believe at a gut level, You're gonna come through, plus you're gonna get great products that your family already need.
[01:26:26.715 --> 01:26:27.876]  So don't procrastinate.
[01:26:28.036 --> 01:26:28.896]  Show InfoWars.
[01:26:29.336 --> 01:26:30.297]  You want us to stay on the air.
[01:26:30.717 --> 01:26:34.039]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com where we got three great products back in stock.
[01:26:34.459 --> 01:26:38.101]  Vitamin C and Zinc, highest quality, super strong, back in stock.
[01:26:38.461 --> 01:26:42.203]  Vitamin D3 and Calcium, and of course, DNA Force Plus.
[01:26:42.643 --> 01:26:47.845]  All these products are 50% off together in a combo pack, or 40% off individually.
[01:26:48.246 --> 01:26:50.307]  So they're great products you already need for your immune system.
[01:26:51.087 --> 01:26:52.168]  And we need the money to stay on air.
[01:26:52.449 --> 01:26:53.590]  So please take action now.
[01:26:53.550 --> 01:27:09.069]  Thank you.
[01:27:09.947 --> 01:27:10.627]  Open borders.
[01:27:11.227 --> 01:27:11.888]  Globalism.
[01:27:12.508 --> 01:27:13.148]  Recession.
[01:27:13.508 --> 01:27:14.489]  Defund the police.
[01:27:15.229 --> 01:27:15.789]  Violence.
[01:27:16.470 --> 01:27:17.350]  Human trafficking.
[01:27:18.091 --> 01:27:18.591]  Fentanyl.
[01:27:19.371 --> 01:27:19.731]  Deaths.
[01:27:20.251 --> 01:27:21.032]  He goes on and on.
[01:27:21.772 --> 01:27:36.679]  But the problem with the graphic by Branco, a great political cartoonist, is it's got Joe Biden as the root, and the donkey, and Obama, and a sippy cup.
[01:27:37.995 --> 01:27:39.336]  There's a through line of hate.
[01:27:40.877 --> 01:27:54.148]  From massacres of indigenous people, to the original sin of slavery, the terror of the Klan, to anti-immigration, violence against the Irish, Italians, Chinese, Mexicans.
[01:27:54.949 --> 01:27:56.490]  So many of those laced through our history.
[01:27:58.431 --> 01:28:06.138]  There's a through line of violence against religious groups, anti-Semitic, anti-Catholic, anti-Mormon, anti-Muslim, anti-Hindu, anti-Sikh.
[01:28:06.906 --> 01:28:09.407]  And that's through line of hate never fully goes away.
[01:28:10.367 --> 01:28:14.129]  But the root causes are really the globalists like Klaus Schwab.
[01:28:14.769 --> 01:28:18.491]  They're grooming a younger generation of globalist talent.
[01:28:18.511 --> 01:28:20.632]  They're focused on cultivating this next generation.
[01:28:21.332 --> 01:28:23.473]  And they've proven that they're quite good at this.
[01:28:23.853 --> 01:28:26.554]  This is a quote from Schwab in 2017.
[01:28:27.094 --> 01:28:35.739]   I have to say that when I mention now names like Miss Angela Merkel, Even Vladimir Putin and so on, they've all been young global leaders at the WEF.
[01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:41.004]  But what we're very proud of now is the young generation like Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
[01:28:42.265 --> 01:28:44.126]  We penetrate the cabinet.
[01:28:45.167 --> 01:28:47.508]  But we see he's complimenting himself for doing what?
[01:28:47.948 --> 01:28:52.630]  Infiltrating the Canadian government, grooming the Prime Minister, and then infiltrating his cabinet.
[01:28:53.091 --> 01:28:56.872]  So again, where does that leave the Daily Beast and their theory that this is some sort of a conspiracy?
[01:28:57.553 --> 01:29:04.903]   This is all a rebrand or a relaunch of the New World Order, which was again called a Conspiracy.
[01:29:05.283 --> 01:29:05.503]  Right.
[01:29:06.184 --> 01:29:08.605]  And it was to create a totalitarian world government.
[01:29:08.665 --> 01:29:14.667]  Perhaps something akin to what we've seen from the UN, from the EU, or the WHO.
[01:29:14.707 --> 01:29:15.927]  They've been in the news a little bit lately.
[01:29:16.447 --> 01:29:20.929]  Unelected, unaccountable to the people, but they tell you what to do with your lives.
[01:29:21.129 --> 01:29:32.519]  So what the Great Reset architects believe is that modern democracy and a free market capitalism, not kind of capitalism we have today, we'll talk about that in a little bit, but a free market capitalism has failed.
[01:29:33.019 --> 01:29:39.044]  And the only way to fix it is by marrying corporate interests and the increasingly powerful state.
[01:29:39.624 --> 01:29:43.668]  This will create corporatist super states or maybe one day a super state.
[01:29:44.148 --> 01:29:46.108]  That will see a new world government take shape.
[01:29:46.168 --> 01:29:46.949]  It's already happening.
[01:29:47.409 --> 01:29:54.270]  Though it might not necessarily take the form of a government, it's a functional dictatorship via corporations.
[01:29:54.330 --> 01:29:55.971]  That's what they're doing and it's already happening.
[01:29:56.471 --> 01:29:59.591]  And his corporate controllers, like Bill Gates.
[01:30:00.011 --> 01:30:04.852]  This guy's unelected and he's got way too much influence in global healthcare.
[01:30:05.873 --> 01:30:07.833]  He's a college dropout.
[01:30:09.133 --> 01:30:10.274]  He's not even a coder.
[01:30:10.374 --> 01:30:10.974]  Did you know that?
[01:30:11.274 --> 01:30:12.314]  He doesn't write code.
[01:30:14.690 --> 01:30:16.551]  He's just a monopolist.
[01:30:16.711 --> 01:30:18.231]  He's a criminal and a monopolist.
[01:30:18.732 --> 01:30:24.054]  And he went to Jeffrey Epstein's island, which makes a lot of people say he's a child raper.
[01:30:24.274 --> 01:30:28.096]  He told Trump, don't set up a commission to study vaccines.
[01:30:29.016 --> 01:30:29.996]  That would be a dead end.
[01:30:30.216 --> 01:30:31.977]  That would be a bad thing.
[01:30:32.437 --> 01:30:32.718]  Why?
[01:30:32.838 --> 01:30:34.658]  What are they going to find out?
[01:30:34.738 --> 01:30:37.199]  They're going to find out that vaccines are safe and effective, right?
[01:30:37.459 --> 01:30:38.340]  Wouldn't that be good?
[01:30:39.401 --> 01:30:44.185]  And the King of England who is involved in all this eugenics and depopulation, King Charles III.
[01:30:44.445 --> 01:30:55.073]  At the moment we've so degraded natural systems, ecosystems, biodiversity, that it's becoming increasingly impossible for nature to sustain us.
[01:30:55.533 --> 01:30:56.975]  At the moment it's all take-take.
[01:30:57.415 --> 01:31:04.801]  Now we've reached the situation where we really need four planets like Earth to survive or to provide enough for everybody.
[01:31:05.001 --> 01:31:07.503]  But really at the end of the day, it's the devil.
[01:31:08.638 --> 01:31:09.218]  Is it the root?
[01:31:09.238 --> 01:31:21.101]  The root cause, ladies and gentlemen, is not King Charles, not Bill Gates, not Klaus Schwab, not the donkey, but it's evil.
[01:31:21.861 --> 01:31:28.703]  Call it what you want, you can say what it is, you can play games all day, but this is a fight between good versus evil.
[01:31:29.457 --> 01:31:32.659]  And everything the New World Order does is destructive of their own interest.
[01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:36.823]  They go out of their way to kill, steal, and destroy because they like it.
[01:31:37.403 --> 01:31:38.684]  Because they hate God's creation.
[01:31:38.944 --> 01:31:39.965]  They hate human destiny.
[01:31:40.025 --> 01:31:47.385]   They are fundamentally, spiritually jealous of the tree of life, and they want the tree of death.
[01:31:47.385 --> 01:31:54.185]  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:54.256 --> 01:31:58.219]  Royce White here live from Minneapolis, and I am your guest host for the hour.
[01:31:59.173 --> 01:32:01.634]  I cannot say how privileged I am.
[01:32:01.714 --> 01:32:05.656]  There's a lot to talk about, a lot to talk about this hour and we're going to get into it.
[01:32:07.016 --> 01:32:17.760]  But first and foremost, I want to send a special thank you to my good friend Alex Jones and everything he's going through today and has been going through for the past few months.
[01:32:18.981 --> 01:32:20.261]  It is a privilege.
[01:32:21.702 --> 01:32:27.644]  It's an honor to be able to host this legendary, this legendary platform.
[01:32:28.488 --> 01:32:43.825]  Um, during a historic time where the establishment has decided anybody who disagrees with them, anybody who wants to tell the truth, anybody who has the courage to be an American citizen or be a child of God is persona non grata.
[01:32:44.825 --> 01:32:50.447]  And in line for execution, extermination, cancellation, censorship, you name it.
[01:32:50.927 --> 01:32:53.708]  So special thank you to Alex Jones for allowing me to host this guest hour.
[01:32:53.748 --> 01:32:58.569]  We wish you luck in the tyrannical kangaroo courts there in Connecticut today.
[01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:13.014]  I was, uh, you know, I was roped into Alex's story more recently during the big three that culminated here at the end of the summer.
[01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:16.582]  I was interviewed by Der Spiegel, I think it is.
[01:33:16.642 --> 01:33:22.226]  Der Spiegel is the New World Order outpost publication there in Germany.
[01:33:23.047 --> 01:33:31.112]  And I was asked about Alex Jones as well as in a story for Mother Jones publication.
[01:33:31.753 --> 01:33:34.515]  And my relationship with Alex was discussed there.
[01:33:34.535 --> 01:33:57.337]   And it's interesting because in both cases, I guess it's odd for me as somebody who comes from the outside, who was kind of a loner, kind of a nomad, and just tried to find people, objectively, who I thought had a genuine and honest outlook on the world that we live in today.
[01:33:58.220 --> 01:34:15.408]  And Alex Jones has always come across as somebody who was genuine, who was authentic, who was insightful, who was brilliant, who at times was wild and entertaining, but was always somebody you wanted to keep your eyes on and listen to his take on things.
[01:34:16.249 --> 01:34:23.412]  And I didn't necessarily understand how the rest of the world perceived Alex Jones.
[01:34:24.272 --> 01:34:53.491]   And not to say that the mainstream establishment medias Narrative around Alex Jones or even around the way people perceive Alex Jones Zachary because we know we live in a time full of of technocratic echo chambers that that are You know built and shaped by algorithms Intended to make you believe that that a narrative or a sentiment is towards a person that maybe isn't but I have heard from a number of people personally who
[01:34:54.537 --> 01:35:26.206]   Really believe the establishment narrative around Alex and that that's troublesome and it's troublesome because Alex couldn't be more spot-on Around the overall narrative or archetype or or 30,000 foot view of what it is we deal with and And more more recently I was accused of something that I want to talk about here in this first segment But we're gonna get into a lot more Let's just go straight down the middle here, okay?
[01:35:27.287 --> 01:35:27.788]  For a moment.
[01:35:28.708 --> 01:35:29.309]  Globalism.
[01:35:29.969 --> 01:35:30.390]  What is it?
[01:35:31.691 --> 01:35:32.772]  What is globalism?
[01:35:33.652 --> 01:35:37.656]  I mean, it's a word that if you're in the knowing, sounds perfectly familiar.
[01:35:37.956 --> 01:35:42.360]  There's nothing, you know, there's nothing ambiguous about it.
[01:35:42.380 --> 01:35:43.401]  There's nothing vague about it.
[01:35:43.441 --> 01:35:46.463]  There's nothing manipulative about using the term.
[01:35:46.503 --> 01:36:04.476]   We all understand it to be an attempt to say, Economically attack citizenship by destroying borders in pursuit of a global governance and that seems to be obvious in terms of the intent of the establishment.
[01:36:04.536 --> 01:36:17.404]  They show us every day how eager they are to have a global governance and how willing they are to give up American citizenship for all of us or on behalf of all of us and throw away our Constitution to achieve that.
[01:36:18.325 --> 01:36:33.797]   But the most troubling troubling accusation that I see out there is one that suggests anybody who says the term globalism is using it as a dog whistle for anti-semitism.
[01:36:35.277 --> 01:36:37.658]  And this offends me.
[01:36:39.379 --> 01:36:52.678]   It offends me because it's almost like we'll use the race narrative as long as we can until black people start getting Wise or, or, or, uh, you know, catching on to the scam.
[01:36:53.179 --> 01:37:01.125]  And then because we can't call black people racist, we'll just divert or, or, um, you know, default to anti-Semitism.
[01:37:01.966 --> 01:37:37.595]   And, you know, and it's instead of Alex, instead of me, instead of Steve Bannon, it was instead of Breitbart, it said any, any conservatives or right-wingers, right-wingers, Are you know said to be anti-semitic and we say globalism and I just rejected in its premise but but I also want to try and properly frame what globalism is on the record here on InfoWars for those who may be coming to to take an accounting of what we believe anti-semitism I mean globalism is.
[01:37:39.378 --> 01:37:46.181]  And the globalism business model is, and always has been, three very distinct businesses.
[01:37:47.942 --> 01:37:52.264]  The slave trade, the drug trade, and piracy.
[01:37:52.384 --> 01:37:57.206]  That is, in effect, what globalism's business model is.
[01:37:57.846 --> 01:37:58.867]  It always has been.
[01:37:59.347 --> 01:38:22.369]   It started with empires, then it was the monarchy, then it was the Third Reich, and now today, It is international cooperation, governance, the United Nations, and I wanted to really try and delve into the history a little bit, so far as I see it, in my opinion, of how this all unfolded.
[01:38:26.251 --> 01:38:27.812]  World War II was the turning point.
[01:38:28.052 --> 01:38:37.911]   I mean, there's no doubt that World War II was a significant marker in the narrative Of international politics.
[01:38:39.453 --> 01:38:50.743]  And essentially, nationalism as a concept, juxtaposed to globalism, is by default considered on the road to fascist Nazi Germany.
[01:38:52.845 --> 01:39:18.027]   And you know, you just have, it's just It's a failure of history, an intentional, unintentionally manifested, manufactured lack of intellectual depth and an historical basis to believe that nationalism by default is fascistic or on its way to Nazism.
[01:39:18.848 --> 01:39:29.313]   And when you really think about Nazi Germany, and I said this the other day in my in my open letter to Well, everyone.
[01:39:30.173 --> 01:39:34.335]  But, you know, an open letter to the walking dead that you can read on my sub stack.
[01:39:35.115 --> 01:39:37.817]  I said that, you know, Hitler was the ultimate beta male.
[01:39:38.037 --> 01:39:38.897]  No, sorry.
[01:39:40.318 --> 01:39:45.920]  Hitler was a globalist and Satan is the ultimate beta male.
[01:39:46.700 --> 01:39:49.722]  But in effect, Hitler is a globalist.
[01:39:49.842 --> 01:39:51.703]  He was a globalist, right?
[01:39:52.223 --> 01:40:07.602]   I mean, he wanted to expand The Third Reich as far as he possibly could and create a global influence over the scope of politics at the world scale by any means necessary.
[01:40:07.722 --> 01:40:49.806]   And even more interesting is if you really understand the history like Alex speaks so eloquently about of Nazi Germany, the current crown, the throne, Is not of England even I mean the the the throne and the bloodline as it stands today can be traced back to Germans And so there were other empires before that the Roman Empire as well was it was an example of globalism Maybe you could say was the sine qua non of globalism, but it's so odd to see such a very simple detail overlooked sometimes intentionally
[01:40:50.495 --> 01:40:55.760]  Definitely when it comes to the mainstream's narrative around Nazi Germany, globalism versus nationalism.
[01:40:56.461 --> 01:41:10.856]  But your everyday person, and this is what we face today, and this is what we're going to talk about for this hour, is the onus being on us, the American citizens, to take ourselves seriously enough to understand these things.
[01:41:11.383 --> 01:41:21.553]  To understand the scope of history, to be able to refer to the factual details in conversation about these very great issues.
[01:41:23.962 --> 01:41:30.306]  The ministry right to take these truths to take these details and spread them spread them out and spread out.
[01:41:31.607 --> 01:41:33.449]  So we're going to be talking about that all hour again.
[01:41:33.489 --> 01:41:37.251]  I'm happy to be here hosting this legendary platform.
[01:41:37.311 --> 01:41:42.915]  We are wishing Alex Jones the best of luck today in the kangaroo courts in Connecticut understanding.
[01:41:42.955 --> 01:41:45.537]  We may all be next stay over after the break.
[01:41:46.037 --> 01:41:47.978]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen Royce White here.
[01:41:48.039 --> 01:41:49.459]  I'm your guest host for the hour.
[01:41:49.940 --> 01:41:54.880]   We're getting right into it, you know, Globalism versus nationalism.
[01:41:55.060 --> 01:41:55.901]  This is the question.
[01:41:56.802 --> 01:42:08.769]  And in the last segment, I said that I believe it's my opinion that the three pillars of the globalist business model are and always have been the same.
[01:42:09.329 --> 01:42:14.172]  You have slavery, the slave trade, the drug trade, and piracy.
[01:42:15.213 --> 01:42:25.573]   And, you know, something very, very manipulative Has taken place or took place post-World War II, when they used Hitler as the ultimate scapegoat.
[01:42:25.653 --> 01:42:28.716]  Not to say that Hitler wasn't an evil man and didn't do atrocious things.
[01:42:28.736 --> 01:42:42.148]  It's just to say that it's very clear, looking back, in retrospect, that the shift around international politics used Hitler in a very advantageous way.
[01:42:42.949 --> 01:42:44.911]  And let me, let's just go through some of them.
[01:42:46.403 --> 01:42:54.465]  The slave trade and people will say, oh, right wingers make this, this, you know, have this problem as well and go, oh, you're not enslaved today.
[01:42:55.065 --> 01:42:57.626]  You should be thankful you live in America.
[01:42:58.386 --> 01:43:03.347]  America is the greatest country on earth and you have privilege beyond belief.
[01:43:03.367 --> 01:43:09.009]  Imagine living in some third world country where you live in a hut and you, you know, drink water with mud.
[01:43:09.809 --> 01:43:11.489]  Sorry, that's a bad right winger voice.
[01:43:11.549 --> 01:43:20.791]   I'm not trying to be condescending, but It's frustrating because we can't let the opposition frame
[01:43:20.791 --> 01:43:26.911]   the way that we look and speak at issues because it hinders our ability to spread a
[01:43:26.911 --> 01:43:35.020]   genuine ministry and to open up our tent for genuine growth, not for salacious talking
[01:43:35.020 --> 01:43:39.001]  points and rhetoric, no, genuine growth.
[01:43:39.001 --> 01:43:43.041]   And that's what I've always respected about Ali Jones is although some of the things may
[01:43:43.041 --> 01:43:52.400]   sound crazy, you can tell from the process of thought that Alex is really trying to understand
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:54.842]  these things at a nuanced and detailed level.
[01:43:55.287 --> 01:44:01.596]  And if you don't want to understand these things at a nuanced and detailed level, then you have decided and conceded to be a fool.
[01:44:02.137 --> 01:44:03.298]  I'm not willing to be a fool.
[01:44:03.738 --> 01:44:05.079]  Alex isn't willing to be a fool.
[01:44:05.380 --> 01:44:09.823]  Many people who watch Infowars are not willing to be fools.
[01:44:10.283 --> 01:44:22.533]  But I think in general, at mass, many people want to have an emotional investment in political conversations, but aren't willing to look at the nuance.
[01:44:22.573 --> 01:44:23.693]  And that's a big issue.
[01:44:23.733 --> 01:44:26.636]  So you have people who say, you should feel privileged to live in America.
[01:44:26.716 --> 01:44:26.856]  No.
[01:44:27.951 --> 01:44:33.474]  America is not the greatest country on earth or in history because of its practice.
[01:44:34.154 --> 01:44:35.675]  It's because of its ideals.
[01:44:36.075 --> 01:44:38.937]  There's a difference between ideals and the application of.
[01:44:38.977 --> 01:44:56.706]  The problem with the liberal establishment and the Democrat platform or the Marxist platform or the globalist platform or the New World Order is that they presume that the very fundamental ideals of America are illegitimate.
[01:44:57.268 --> 01:45:01.831]  And that's where the distinct line in the sand should be drawn.
[01:45:02.531 --> 01:45:18.260]  Anybody like Abandoned, for example, or Alex Jones, all of us have strong critiques about how the application of power or institutions is used in this country to undermine American citizenship.
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:22.967]   And I say that because I mean, let's look at the slave trade.
[01:45:23.107 --> 01:45:24.650]  Many people go, oh, you're not slaves.
[01:45:25.210 --> 01:45:26.372]  Especially me as a black man.
[01:45:26.412 --> 01:45:28.115]  They'll go, don't say you're a slave.
[01:45:28.536 --> 01:45:36.895]   or all of the athletes who equate, let's say, the unequal distribution of ownership in pro sports,
[01:45:37.864 --> 01:45:39.065]  You make millions of dollars.
[01:45:39.125 --> 01:45:40.586]  I work at the post office.
[01:45:40.646 --> 01:45:41.967]  I can barely keep my lights on.
[01:45:41.987 --> 01:45:43.247]  That's not the athlete's fault.
[01:45:43.768 --> 01:45:44.088]  Okay?
[01:45:44.128 --> 01:45:45.008]  Grow some balls.
[01:45:45.489 --> 01:45:46.909]  Go down to your city hall.
[01:45:47.370 --> 01:45:48.430]  Knock on some doors.
[01:45:48.811 --> 01:45:50.552]  Organize some political campaigns.
[01:45:50.572 --> 01:45:53.333]  65% of you don't even vote out there.
[01:45:53.533 --> 01:45:57.215]  There's more people who have an opinion on the internet than vote in this country.
[01:45:57.255 --> 01:45:59.717]  So I hear these complaints.
[01:46:00.959 --> 01:46:13.542]  Online, you know through the airwaves and and I look at him with a side eye as I go More people complaining than actually doing something like running for office, you know, will the uniparty cheat me?
[01:46:13.602 --> 01:46:14.843]  Did they cheat me probably?
[01:46:15.803 --> 01:46:17.003]  Is the fix in from the globe?
[01:46:17.063 --> 01:46:22.385]  Yeah, okay, but we don't resign This this movement isn't a resignation is removed movement.
[01:46:23.205 --> 01:46:26.106]  We don't resign from the things that have become corrected corrupted.
[01:46:26.126 --> 01:46:34.814]   We fix them We go in, we roll our sleeves up, we put our hands in the mud, and we mine out what we need to mine out in order to move forward.
[01:46:35.734 --> 01:46:37.455]  So, slavery, for example.
[01:46:38.256 --> 01:46:39.337]  Well, you're not slaves.
[01:46:40.998 --> 01:46:49.323]  All that happened in this country was that we went from being slaves in chains to wage slaves.
[01:46:50.123 --> 01:46:54.266]  And the scope of slavery expanded.
[01:46:54.710 --> 01:46:59.814]  From being blacks, predominantly blacks, to all the working class.
[01:47:00.254 --> 01:47:00.855]  Very simple.
[01:47:01.735 --> 01:47:04.057]  Very simple maneuver.
[01:47:04.217 --> 01:47:05.758]  Oh, no more chains?
[01:47:06.579 --> 01:47:22.230]  Oh, there's a movement, there's a political movement coming that has convinced or manufactured a consent that the chain, the brutality of slavery is no longer acceptable?
[01:47:22.531 --> 01:47:22.991]  Fine!
[01:47:23.911 --> 01:47:25.293]  Fine, we'll take the chains away.
[01:47:25.353 --> 01:47:27.136]  That's not a problem.
[01:47:27.957 --> 01:47:30.040]  As long as the result is still the same.
[01:47:31.061 --> 01:47:32.544]  And the result is still the same.
[01:47:33.084 --> 01:47:34.584]  Right, and you are a wage slave.
[01:47:34.604 --> 01:47:36.925]  If you work at the post office, you're a wage slave.
[01:47:36.965 --> 01:47:44.627]  If you are, you know, if you're a teacher, in some respects, the teacher's unions are corrupt too, but you're a wage slave.
[01:47:44.667 --> 01:47:46.188]  A police officer, you're a wage slave.
[01:47:46.408 --> 01:47:52.729]  The working class have become wage slaves under a globalist initiative, which really was put in place post-World War II.
[01:47:53.069 --> 01:48:01.374]   You go back, you look at the Bretton Woods Conference, The Bretton Woods Conference gave birth to what would become the World Bank and the IMF.
[01:48:01.835 --> 01:48:04.216]  Many people don't even know about the Bretton Woods Conference.
[01:48:04.256 --> 01:48:05.776]  I'm just giving you things to go look at.
[01:48:06.256 --> 01:48:07.977]  So the slave trade has changed.
[01:48:08.217 --> 01:48:23.124]  That's one narrative that has been slightly, uh, slightly, uh, you know, amended to achieve the same result, but, but, but, uh, confused the average American citizen.
[01:48:23.884 --> 01:48:25.745]  How about the drug trade?
[01:48:26.570 --> 01:48:27.571]  That's the next example.
[01:48:28.392 --> 01:48:32.975]  And yeah, I mean, the drug trade is same as it's always been.
[01:48:33.135 --> 01:48:42.583]  Other than, you know, the new form of the drug trade is the manufactured digital online.
[01:48:44.065 --> 01:48:48.168]  Online user experience intended to mainline dopamine.
[01:48:48.755 --> 01:48:49.716]  Okay.
[01:48:49.776 --> 01:48:58.602]  Formerly known as the Internet, now referred to as the Internet of Things, the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the Great Reset, so on and so forth.
[01:48:59.103 --> 01:48:59.963]  But we can trace it.
[01:49:00.004 --> 01:49:01.204]  It's the same model.
[01:49:01.425 --> 01:49:04.267]  Let's go all the way back to the opium wars, right?
[01:49:04.367 --> 01:49:10.351]  The opium war that we fought against China, that we're still fighting against China, and actually they're paying us back for it right now.
[01:49:10.812 --> 01:49:12.613]  Have all the fentanyl you want, America.
[01:49:13.556 --> 01:49:18.978]  And your and your and your globalists sell out uniparty elites in D.C.
[01:49:19.078 --> 01:49:19.958]  and on Wall Street.
[01:49:20.279 --> 01:49:26.281]  They're more than willing to open your borders to as much fentanyl as you as you can possibly take.
[01:49:26.341 --> 01:49:29.822]  That's warfare by that's that's a warfare by asymmetrical means.
[01:49:30.242 --> 01:49:30.422]  Right.
[01:49:30.442 --> 01:49:35.684]  Because the death of a culture, the destruction of a culture is better than the destruction of armies.
[01:49:35.845 --> 01:49:37.505]  And one usually precludes the other.
[01:49:38.045 --> 01:49:39.966]  So we got the slave trade has been shifted.
[01:49:39.986 --> 01:49:42.127]  We got the drug trade that's been shifted.
[01:49:42.964 --> 01:49:44.245]  And the final one is piracy.
[01:49:45.485 --> 01:49:46.265]  This is the business.
[01:49:46.305 --> 01:49:47.966]  My piracy is the same as it's always been.
[01:49:47.986 --> 01:49:50.307]  Before, it was nautical conquest.
[01:49:50.327 --> 01:49:51.327]  We show up on your shores.
[01:49:51.347 --> 01:49:52.728]  We kill as many people as we need to.
[01:49:53.008 --> 01:49:54.208]  We take your natural resources.
[01:49:54.308 --> 01:50:03.652]  Now, we wage wars through an international collaborative in pursuit of democracy, social justice, and environmentalism.
[01:50:05.325 --> 01:50:05.905]  Globalism.
[01:50:06.145 --> 01:50:06.926]  That's globalism.
[01:50:07.226 --> 01:50:08.326]  Got nothing to do with Jews.
[01:50:08.607 --> 01:50:09.967]  Got nothing to do with anti-Semitism.
[01:50:10.367 --> 01:50:16.850]  It's a very structured business model that has people from all nationalities, colors, and creeds from here to Beijing.
[01:50:16.871 --> 01:50:20.872]  And we're going to talk more about that after this break.
[01:50:21.953 --> 01:50:26.935]  I want to stay on this theme of globalism versus nationalism because I think it's the most important thing we face as Americans.
[01:50:27.916 --> 01:50:28.376]  Stay tuned.
[01:50:29.184 --> 01:50:38.011]  Royce White here, continuing on as your guest host of InfoWars for the hour, and we've been talking nationalism versus globalism, and I want to continue down that thread.
[01:50:38.051 --> 01:50:57.687]  But first, I want to say again, to refer back to Alex Jones and his current situation, you know, when you look for the truth, when you look for the reality that is being intentionally hidden, you are going to be mistaken sometimes.
[01:50:58.220 --> 01:50:59.901]  Right, that's just normal.
[01:51:00.081 --> 01:51:01.963]  That's human.
[01:51:02.943 --> 01:51:19.594]  And the real bait-and-switch, the real double-cross and triple-cross that the mainstream media has done on people, you could say, is the onus is so high to be right 100% of the time that nobody takes a chance on trying to find the truth that is intentionally hidden.
[01:51:20.355 --> 01:51:38.716]   And you could say a lot of things to Alex Jones, but what you can't say is that he has shied away from The danger of traveling down the unknown road to find the truth that we all know is being hidden from us.
[01:51:39.436 --> 01:51:51.521]  And what's most scary is that the liberal establishment or the liberal platform used to, in some respects, at least admit tacitly that there was a man.
[01:51:52.310 --> 01:51:52.610]  Right?
[01:51:53.590 --> 01:51:58.031]  There were forces at work that meant to undermine, subvert, manipulate us.
[01:51:58.471 --> 01:51:58.631]  Right?
[01:51:58.671 --> 01:52:07.233]  Those were the Noam Chomsky's of the world, who is now, you know, in his older age, just conceded to the momentum of the globalist narrative.
[01:52:07.273 --> 01:52:17.695]  But your Noam Chomsky's used to, I mean, Manufacturing Consent was one of Noam Chomsky's seminal works, where he talked about the mainstream media and the manipulation of.
[01:52:18.215 --> 01:52:19.015]  And he was a Jew.
[01:52:19.095 --> 01:52:21.596]  And he was a Jew that criticized Israel and Zionism.
[01:52:22.337 --> 01:52:35.107]  He was a Jew who they kept from the mainstream spotlight for most of his life even though he was considered and revered as one of the most important intellectuals of our generation.
[01:52:36.088 --> 01:52:45.176]  But now the liberal establishment, and Alex Jones is a perfect case, where you have to be 100% right all of the time and trying to find the truth.
[01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:54.436]  I mean, I guess this just offends me as an athlete because when we were and I talked about this in my recent letter, and if you can, please go to my sub stack and read it.
[01:52:54.536 --> 01:52:56.718]  All of my work on sub stack is free.
[01:52:57.118 --> 01:52:59.760]  I'm not trying to make money or get rich off of you.
[01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:06.145]  In fact, I would much rather you send some money to Infowars and Alex and help support him in his time of need right now.
[01:53:07.006 --> 01:53:09.968]  But but please go read my open letter to the walking dead.
[01:53:10.468 --> 01:53:15.432]  And I talk about Alex Jones, Kyrie Irving and and and the choosing people.
[01:53:16.633 --> 01:53:36.392]   And the reason why is because recently Kyrie Irving had posted a video of Alex back from back in 2002 where he laid out the globalist, you know, The globalist agenda and in great detail and was spot on in retrospect, it could have been more accurate if you're an honest person.
[01:53:37.232 --> 01:53:39.093]  So Kyrie was thrown under the bus this week.
[01:53:39.153 --> 01:53:44.936]  And obviously, I mean, I just I just couldn't allow for people to to rewrite history in real time and not say anything.
[01:53:44.956 --> 01:53:45.756]  So I wrote this letter.
[01:53:45.796 --> 01:53:46.496]  It's a bit lengthy.
[01:53:46.516 --> 01:54:06.607]   But the point is in it, I say, as an athlete, I can appreciate the pursuit of the truth and the frequency of failure in it, because As an athlete, we were taught that in order to grow, in order to get better, in order to improve your skill, you have to be right on the edge of making a mistake.
[01:54:07.307 --> 01:54:08.968]  That there's nothing to be gained.
[01:54:09.349 --> 01:54:12.210]  There's no real growth.
[01:54:12.851 --> 01:54:24.048]   There's no exponential growth for you to do something Just in order to get through the day, just in order to get through the drill, right?
[01:54:24.088 --> 01:54:31.955]  In basketball, you do drills and it's, you know, through the legs, behind the bag, two dribbles and a pull-up jump shot, right?
[01:54:32.595 --> 01:54:39.074]   But a great coach taught me that You have to be right on the edge of losing that ball.
[01:54:39.495 --> 01:54:51.005]  You have to be right on the edge of losing your balance in order to understand what it means to go hard enough to find the success that you'll need in the toughest moments when the game is on the line.
[01:54:51.765 --> 01:54:54.087]  And that's the courage that Alex Jones has exhibited.
[01:54:55.068 --> 01:54:57.050]  And many of many of us don't have it.
[01:54:57.938 --> 01:54:58.999]  I mean, let's just be honest.
[01:54:59.379 --> 01:55:15.911]  In our everyday lives, many of us don't have that courage to be on the razor's edge of failure to find what it is we need to find in order to be transformative, in order to be transcended, in order to be courageous children of God.
[01:55:17.252 --> 01:55:19.413]  And we have to get back to that.
[01:55:21.034 --> 01:55:28.768]   I forgot an important piece of the globalism business model when we talked about You know, the three.
[01:55:29.108 --> 01:55:32.330]  And these are the three that they've been and they always have been.
[01:55:32.710 --> 01:55:34.852]  Slavery, the drug trade, and piracy.
[01:55:35.012 --> 01:55:40.555]  That's the business model of globalism and point blank.
[01:55:41.776 --> 01:55:49.261]  But just to, you know, consider how manipulative these narratives really are.
[01:55:50.162 --> 01:55:52.263]  What was the sine qua non of the drug trade?
[01:55:52.839 --> 01:55:53.059]  Right.
[01:55:53.099 --> 01:55:56.660]  When we think of drugs in this country, you know, you got cocaine and crack.
[01:55:56.680 --> 01:55:58.400]  And that was in my lifetime.
[01:55:58.460 --> 01:55:59.040]  Heroin.
[01:55:59.421 --> 01:56:01.241]  Now it's fentanyl and opioids.
[01:56:01.301 --> 01:56:11.763]  And I mean, like I said before, the fentanyl is just a reboot or a repeat of an opium war that we're still fighting with China, which is asymmetrical.
[01:56:13.284 --> 01:56:14.884]  But let's go before the opium.
[01:56:15.624 --> 01:56:15.924]  Sugar.
[01:56:17.145 --> 01:56:19.065]  Sugar is the sine qua non of the drug trade.
[01:56:19.085 --> 01:56:22.226]  I mean, how common has sugar become?
[01:56:23.055 --> 01:56:25.357]  How accepted is sugar?
[01:56:26.097 --> 01:56:37.105]  And today, you know, it's just I mean, when you really get down to that level of analysis, it becomes painfully obvious that the issue is not the New World Order.
[01:56:37.986 --> 01:56:39.607]  The issue are not the globalists.
[01:56:40.649 --> 01:56:43.570]  I mean, they've put together a great racket, no doubt.
[01:56:44.090 --> 01:56:46.310]  They've made us wage slaves.
[01:56:46.350 --> 01:56:58.332]  They've taken a drug model and they've turned it into the Internet of Things and made you addicted consumers of content and goods.
[01:56:58.372 --> 01:57:06.874]  They've taken your empathomania and wage piracy in the name of democracy, social justice, and environmentalism.
[01:57:09.963 --> 01:57:12.004]  I mean, that points to us being the problem.
[01:57:12.804 --> 01:57:13.664]  We are the problem.
[01:57:14.144 --> 01:57:22.747]  And I texted Alex about a month back, or two months back, and he had talked about the transgender drag queen shows.
[01:57:23.247 --> 01:57:28.349]  And I think it was the best bit I've ever seen Alex do, at least in recent memory.
[01:57:28.669 --> 01:57:34.291]  To me, it struck the deepest because he put the onus on us, the viewers, you and me.
[01:57:35.023 --> 01:57:40.707]  And he said, I mean, if you let these people get up close to your kids, there's nothing you won't put up with.
[01:57:41.347 --> 01:57:56.657]  And I absolutely love that, because really and truly, we can talk about the enemy all day, but there's nothing so covert or so complex or so sophisticated that the enemy has done, drawn up, that we couldn't resign from.
[01:57:57.258 --> 01:58:08.113]   And I guess a great example of that is, you know, in the last few days, the New York Times posted a Article about the precinct strategy.
[01:58:08.780 --> 01:58:13.463]  And just to be clear, when they post these op-eds, I mean, that's the New York Times posted.
[01:58:13.864 --> 01:58:19.187]  You don't get to post an opinion piece for the New York Times unless the editorial board clears it.
[01:58:19.267 --> 01:58:20.488]  So it's still the New York Times.
[01:58:20.568 --> 01:58:23.150]  I mean, talk about controlled opposition.
[01:58:23.170 --> 01:58:31.315]  They make it seem like they have this open, you know, platform or, you know, this open arena for people to come and write their opinions.
[01:58:31.856 --> 01:58:35.799]  But obviously, there's no conservatives or no real conservatives that get the right.
[01:58:35.859 --> 01:58:47.517]   But anyway, They have now deemed that the precinct strategy, which if you're not familiar with, you should visit precinctstrategy.com, because this is the way that we take back this country.
[01:58:48.077 --> 01:58:53.281]  We must first take control of the Republican Party and weed out all of the controlled opposition.
[01:58:54.182 --> 01:59:01.989]  And the way we do that is to flood the 200,000 open party officer seats that still exist.
[01:59:02.009 --> 01:59:04.871]  If you don't know, the Republican Party is only half full.
[01:59:05.655 --> 01:59:20.768]  And that means that many of us could easily go to our local basic political operating unit, or otherwise known as BPOU, and sign up to be a precinct officer, be a part of the party, and then we can kick these rhinos out.
[01:59:21.809 --> 01:59:31.217]  But the New York Times said that the precinct strategy is the single greatest threat to democracy in this country.
[01:59:32.236 --> 01:59:40.006]  Well, anytime they say something's the greatest threat to democracy, obviously it's the greatest safeguard for democracy, and that's why you should do it.
[01:59:40.066 --> 01:59:42.449]  And that's why you should participate in the precinct strategy.
[01:59:42.730 --> 01:59:44.091]  Because they're clearly afraid of it.
[01:59:46.360 --> 01:59:48.322]  More on that when we come back from the break.
[01:59:48.802 --> 02:00:06.438]  I really want to nail down the onus being on us, the American citizen, and what we can do and how we can look at these issues and prepare ourselves to fight not only the spiritual war, but the practical war, the practical war right here in the physical world, because that battle isn't lost.
[02:00:06.558 --> 02:00:07.859]  And I don't want people to think it is.
[02:00:08.760 --> 02:00:09.240]  Stay tuned.
[02:00:10.021 --> 02:00:11.903]  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, Royce White.
[02:00:11.963 --> 02:00:13.404]  I'm your guest host for this.
[02:00:14.079 --> 02:00:17.981]  Show this hour, we are at the top of the hour, or the bottom of the hour, I should say.
[02:00:18.842 --> 02:00:21.723]  And we've been just talking about globalism versus nationalism.
[02:00:22.484 --> 02:00:28.507]  And I want to say that the answer is not going to be political.
[02:00:29.107 --> 02:00:35.691]  Ultimately, us as faithful children of God understand that the spiritual war is ongoing.
[02:00:36.731 --> 02:00:40.173]  And I don't think that there's a final answer in the political.
[02:00:41.696 --> 02:00:45.277]  But I don't think that we can resign from the political.
[02:00:45.377 --> 02:00:50.439]  I have a big problem with the idea that we can ignore or avoid the political.
[02:00:51.339 --> 02:01:01.202]  And one of the first things that we could do, or should do, go to PrecinctStrategy.com, get involved in the Republican Party.
[02:01:02.542 --> 02:01:07.564]  Do I think that the Republican Party is genuine and honest?
[02:01:07.664 --> 02:01:07.864]  No!
[02:01:08.144 --> 02:01:37.641]   Because the leadership gets to Betray its own platform as a consequence of everyday American citizens working-class America first patriots not being in the party and the party's half-full Understand that they can't keep us out You know and Ron Paul tried this and he did a great job when he you know He had the Ron Paul movement and the Tea Party's done a great job, but the work is is only half done and
[02:01:38.421 --> 02:02:21.010]   And and you know we have to we have to really consider that if things are as bad as we say they are Things are as bad as as many of us believe they are we have to exhaust every possible option In order to save this country And one of those options clearly is to take back a hold of the Republican Party and have a real representation of America and American ideals and values and citizenship and not be bullied culturally by the mainstream media to believe that an America first approach and policy or worldview or spirit is fascist.
[02:02:22.211 --> 02:02:23.651]  You know, we're not fascist.
[02:02:26.810 --> 02:02:32.334]  To say that Republicans and conservatives are fascists is absolutely ridiculous.
[02:02:32.995 --> 02:02:34.516]  No, we want to have a country.
[02:02:35.497 --> 02:02:37.959]  And that is the fundamental question that we have to answer now.
[02:02:37.999 --> 02:02:40.081]  And it's one that we're going to have to answer going forward.
[02:02:40.141 --> 02:02:47.227]  And I hope I have an opportunity to come back and guest host over the next few months as we move towards the elections.
[02:02:49.469 --> 02:02:51.371]  Do we want to have a country or not?
[02:02:52.212 --> 02:02:59.246]   Here in my congressional race, The people of CD5, the Republicans in CD5, had a majority.
[02:03:00.046 --> 02:03:01.808]  So the ballot said.
[02:03:02.688 --> 02:03:03.909]  Chose not to have a country.
[02:03:05.530 --> 02:03:07.212]  Am I completely discouraged by that?
[02:03:07.292 --> 02:03:07.492]  No.
[02:03:07.812 --> 02:03:12.956]  You know, I lost in a tight primary race that was, you know, 4,400 votes to 3,500 votes.
[02:03:12.976 --> 02:03:13.817]  I lost by, you know, 900 votes.
[02:03:13.637 --> 02:03:21.137]  The 3500 votes are lost by 900 votes.
[02:03:21.137 --> 02:03:29.297]   But the Democrats came out in voter turnout almost 10 to 1 or 12 to 1 in the district.
[02:03:29.265 --> 02:03:34.113]  And that's not a product or result of there not being Republicans in the district.
[02:03:34.494 --> 02:03:36.117]  That's a lack of urgency.
[02:03:37.074 --> 02:03:37.414]  Right.
[02:03:37.514 --> 02:03:45.777]  And I think the lack of urgency, the complacency that we've all demonstrated in this country is really how the globalists have gotten such a head start on us.
[02:03:45.817 --> 02:03:50.059]  And it makes us feel as though we can't we can't do anything to change.
[02:03:50.119 --> 02:03:54.280]  It's almost like being in high school and you get behind on your work.
[02:03:54.760 --> 02:04:01.002]  And at a point, it gets so, so big that you think, where do you even start?
[02:04:01.323 --> 02:04:01.503]  Right.
[02:04:01.543 --> 02:04:05.264]  And then so you never start because the task seems insurmountable.
[02:04:06.114 --> 02:04:07.295]  But it's not insurmountable.
[02:04:07.895 --> 02:04:10.837]  I mean, there's nothing that's been done here that can't be undone.
[02:04:11.297 --> 02:04:15.260]  There's nothing that's been done that can't be changed.
[02:04:15.480 --> 02:04:16.401]  But we have to.
[02:04:16.861 --> 02:04:19.483]  We have to become more involved than we've ever been.
[02:04:19.963 --> 02:04:23.305]  And that's listening to people like Alex Jones and supporting Infowars.
[02:04:23.645 --> 02:04:47.107]   But that's also getting up off of the couch when Alex Jones goes off and getting your butt to, you know, your local political Operating unit and becoming a member of the party and standing up in those in those BPOU meetings and in those Senate district meetings and in those congressional district meetings and saying, no, we're going to vote for America.
[02:04:47.147 --> 02:04:56.890]  We're not going to let Joanne Reed or Rachel Maddow or Joe Walsh or or, you know, whoever pick one.
[02:04:57.130 --> 02:04:57.671]  It doesn't matter.
[02:04:57.791 --> 02:04:58.811]  You know, John Oliver.
[02:05:00.218 --> 02:05:06.461]  Or who's the kid that came from South Africa, another token black kid, Trevor Noah.
[02:05:06.781 --> 02:05:13.324]  We're not going to let Trevor Noah say that if you want to have a country that makes you a Nazi, because that's ridiculous.
[02:05:13.764 --> 02:05:15.645]  No, that's actually ridiculous.
[02:05:15.685 --> 02:05:17.626]  And it's also not globalism.
[02:05:17.806 --> 02:05:19.687]  I mean, it's also not anti-Semitic.
[02:05:20.187 --> 02:05:21.947]  It has nothing to do with the Jewish people.
[02:05:21.987 --> 02:05:41.621]   In fact, to try and cheapen The value of nationalism as a political idea down to a petty cultural attack on the Jewish people is kind of a passive-aggressive way for the people who are doing it to be anti-Semitic.
[02:05:42.382 --> 02:05:47.305]  I mean, when we say globalism, none of us mean Jewish people, really.
[02:05:48.666 --> 02:06:03.256]   It's, you know, are they powerful, influential, very wealthy, Anti-jews that are involved and have opted for the new world order That's obvious But those people are running a scam too.
[02:06:03.737 --> 02:06:05.178]  They're using the Jewish identity.
[02:06:05.198 --> 02:06:15.195]   They're using the suffering of the Jewish people they're using they're using Jewish as a as a nomenclature to to to advance their own goal and Right?
[02:06:15.735 --> 02:06:18.996]  The Black Hat, look at Yeshiva University, for example.
[02:06:19.216 --> 02:06:20.877]  Look at that situation.
[02:06:21.257 --> 02:06:28.079]  Oh, and all of the CNNs of the world, and the MSNBCs, and the New York Times.
[02:06:28.840 --> 02:06:35.062]  Oh, they have no Semitic care for the Black Hat.
[02:06:36.442 --> 02:06:38.343]  I mean, doesn't that make it kind of obvious?
[02:06:39.372 --> 02:07:03.211]  That if you're a black man and you say globalism, you mean anti-semitism, unless you're defending the university where you go to become a rabbi and saying that they should be able to preserve their cultural and religious values and beliefs, that they shouldn't have to have or allow LGBTQ club on the campus where you go to become a rabbi.
[02:07:03.231 --> 02:07:11.541]   I mean, why would you need an LGBTQ club On a campus where you go to become a rabbi.
[02:07:11.922 --> 02:07:16.444]  I don't go to the seminary, you know, to start an LGBTQ club.
[02:07:17.625 --> 02:07:18.545]  Or maybe now we do.
[02:07:19.986 --> 02:07:22.428]  And those people are anti-Christian.
[02:07:23.188 --> 02:07:29.152]  And the people who have pushed this, you know, this LGBTQ super narrative are anti-Jews.
[02:07:30.292 --> 02:07:31.433]  That's just the bottom line.
[02:07:31.493 --> 02:07:33.334]  There's nothing anti-Semitic about saying that.
[02:07:33.694 --> 02:07:49.948]   And there are many black cats and many religious Jews around the world who are Extremely, extremely loving, caring, insightful, brilliant, very connected to God, like my good late friend, you know, Dr. Zev Zelenko.
[02:07:51.289 --> 02:07:51.990]  Rest in peace.
[02:07:54.272 --> 02:08:02.298]  Who understand the things that have gone wrong with the Jewish community, the same way I understand the things that have gone wrong with the black community.
[02:08:03.300 --> 02:08:10.102]  And the two are not, you know, are not unconnected, you could say.
[02:08:10.122 --> 02:08:14.423]  And I love that Alex Jones says at bottom, it is Satan, it is evil.
[02:08:14.883 --> 02:08:22.345]  And where the line can't be connected for conspiracy, we must look to the supernatural.
[02:08:22.845 --> 02:08:24.245]  We must look to the metaphysical.
[02:08:25.402 --> 02:08:33.067]  And what Satan would have us believe is that if we can't draw a direct line to the corruption and the conspiracy, then it must not exist.
[02:08:33.808 --> 02:08:44.235]  And that may also be a good reason why people want us to resign our belief in God.
[02:08:45.276 --> 02:09:03.854]   Because if you don't believe in a metaphysical, you've closed off an entire arena or domain where you can find evidence Or you can find the information or the the spirit to understand Conspiracy.
[02:09:04.454 --> 02:09:15.139]  Yeah, there may not be direct conversations happening between certain individuals But that doesn't mean they're not influenced by an evil spirit that has a grander design God has a grand design.
[02:09:15.579 --> 02:09:28.660]   The devil has a grand design now God's design is better and he will win out all of the devil's efforts in the end are futile and But the devil is a being that is much more powerful and forward-thinking than any of us could imagine.
[02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:30.921]  So we have to accept that.
[02:09:31.601 --> 02:09:37.223]  But we cannot let these cultural narratives dissuade us and have us hide.
[02:09:37.263 --> 02:09:38.804]  It's time to come out into the streets.
[02:09:38.864 --> 02:09:42.065]  It's time to come out into the light and say these things with conviction.
[02:09:42.625 --> 02:09:49.107]  And the Republican Party, for example, will not say that globalism is not anti-Semitism.
[02:09:49.828 --> 02:09:50.468]  It's ridiculous.
[02:09:51.317 --> 02:09:55.719]  Just like nationalism isn't racist, okay?
[02:09:57.160 --> 02:09:58.601]  These are lies that have been told.
[02:09:58.721 --> 02:10:08.907]  The business model for globalism is the drug trade, the slave trade, and the piracy.
[02:10:09.767 --> 02:10:29.121]   It always has been, it always will be, and I for one am not willing to trade my American citizenship so that we can wage wars in the name of social justice, Environmentalism and equity.
[02:10:31.703 --> 02:10:32.383]  Neither should you.
[02:10:32.963 --> 02:10:35.165]  Thank you for allowing me to host this hour, Alex Jones.
[02:10:35.205 --> 02:10:37.806]  I appreciate you and the entire InfoWars team.
[02:10:38.567 --> 02:10:39.968]  That's it for me in Minneapolis.
[02:10:39.807 --> 02:10:46.807]  Godspeed.
[02:10:46.807 --> 02:11:01.287]   The best-selling book in America last week was The Great Reset and The War for the Worlds,
[02:11:01.287 --> 02:11:03.047]  written by Alex Jones.
[02:11:03.795 --> 02:11:07.557]  Jones sold more than 56,000 copies of his book last week.
[02:11:07.637 --> 02:11:10.539]  But the New York Times lied about that because the New York Times doesn't want you to know that.
[02:11:10.839 --> 02:11:15.182]  The New York Times wants you to believe that Alex Jones is more discredited than the New York Times.
[02:11:15.602 --> 02:11:20.285]  The paper that started the Iraq War by lying about weapons of mass destruction and got a million people killed.
[02:11:20.725 --> 02:11:21.526]  So they lied about his book.
[02:11:22.557 --> 02:11:24.598]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[02:11:25.078 --> 02:11:34.644]  The historic book that lays out the plans of the Great Reset Death Star and exposes the New World Order's plans for global enslavement.
[02:11:36.245 --> 02:11:45.110]  Get your copy now at Amazon.com to keep the book at number one and InfoWarsTore.com to help keep InfoWars on the air.
[02:11:45.991 --> 02:11:49.633]  The Great Reset and the War for the World by Alex Jones.
[02:11:49.972 --> 02:11:51.972]  Now number one in the world.
[02:11:51.972 --> 02:12:13.972]  [MUSIC]
[02:12:14.176 --> 02:12:16.938]  It is the Summit News Hour, 22nd of September, 2022.
[02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:23.484]  And well, the dystopian social credit score purge accelerates.
[02:12:24.145 --> 02:12:28.028]  Of course, this is something that we've been affected by for years and years and years.
[02:12:28.789 --> 02:12:33.593]  PayPal, of course, banning political dissidents as far back as 2017, 2018.
[02:12:36.363 --> 02:12:41.166]  Now it's finally getting attention because some more high-profile people are getting banned.
[02:12:41.226 --> 02:12:42.887]  I suppose we should be grateful for that.
[02:12:43.268 --> 02:12:45.409]  But again, it's not like this is a new thing.
[02:12:45.429 --> 02:12:47.790]  Specifically, who has been banned?
[02:12:47.830 --> 02:12:51.693]  And it's quite a growing list I'm going to get to in the next segment.
[02:12:52.714 --> 02:12:54.655]  But we've been talking about this for years, of course.
[02:12:55.478 --> 02:12:59.300]  This is the road to social credit score dystopia.
[02:12:59.341 --> 02:13:02.402]  This is the very end goal of all de-platforming.
[02:13:02.823 --> 02:13:05.444]  It's not to make people just lose their Twitter accounts.
[02:13:05.885 --> 02:13:09.367]  The end goal of cancel culture is not to just make people lose their jobs.
[02:13:09.867 --> 02:13:16.412]  It's to leave them destitute and unable to participate in basic economic functions.
[02:13:17.352 --> 02:13:22.035]  Now, the co-founder of PayPal came out, in fact, last year, last August.
[02:13:23.456 --> 02:13:24.737]  This is David Sachs.
[02:13:25.825 --> 02:13:32.366]  And he said that PayPal was creating a de facto no-buy list by banning people for their opinions.
[02:13:32.926 --> 02:13:36.407]  This is the founder of PayPal who came out and warned about this a year ago.
[02:13:36.427 --> 02:13:38.607]  And I've made the point over and over again.
[02:13:38.687 --> 02:13:41.248]  It's about financial strangulation.
[02:13:41.368 --> 02:13:46.669]  It's about the ultimate future where you go to the grocery store to buy some food.
[02:13:47.269 --> 02:13:50.390]  You go to pay with your credit card because of course everything's cashless.
[02:13:50.650 --> 02:13:52.010]  Nobody accepts cash anymore.
[02:13:52.685 --> 02:13:56.489]  That has vastly accelerated, of course, under the Great Reset lockdown.
[02:13:57.390 --> 02:14:00.413]  You have pubs across England now, across the UK.
[02:14:01.114 --> 02:14:03.397]  The very Bastion's the heart of the community.
[02:14:04.157 --> 02:14:06.059]  Even the pubs are going cashless.
[02:14:06.760 --> 02:14:09.143]  So when there's no cash, there's no alternative.
[02:14:09.523 --> 02:14:12.466]  You go to buy your groceries in the store.
[02:14:13.087 --> 02:14:17.166]   Says, sorry, Your credit card payment has been declined.
[02:14:17.686 --> 02:14:20.288]  You misgendered a drag queen on Twitter.
[02:14:20.849 --> 02:14:28.154]  Not only is your payment being declined, your account is now permanently closed because you're a dangerous right-wing extremist.
[02:14:28.174 --> 02:14:35.500]  You're a MAGA extremist, as Joe Biden keeps saying, as teenage Republicans get murdered by left-wing extremists on the streets.
[02:14:37.081 --> 02:14:39.763]  You're on the blacklist, and you're on the blacklist for good.
[02:14:40.814 --> 02:14:45.536]  So the very founder of PayPal warned that that was happening after it already happened for years.
[02:14:46.116 --> 02:15:14.073]   You have PayPal aligning now with governments to create these central banked digital currencies where it completely replaces cash, completely replaces even credit card payments to the point where in Japan, I read recently, and of course I read it on the World Economic Forum website because they were celebrating it, They're talking about companies directly paying employees and bypassing the banks completely.
[02:15:14.854 --> 02:15:16.635]  So we're getting more and more digitized.
[02:15:16.655 --> 02:15:18.156]  We're getting more and more centralized.
[02:15:18.176 --> 02:15:21.458]  We're getting less and less options in terms of financial platforms.
[02:15:22.498 --> 02:15:29.443]  We had a headline from back in January of this year, PayPal permanently bans another conservative journalist from having an account.
[02:15:30.023 --> 02:15:31.804]  In that case, it was Ian Miles Chong.
[02:15:31.844 --> 02:15:52.123]   And again, similarly to the recent examples, which I'm going to go through, sometimes they actually call you up And the people who work at PayPal, because of the type of people they hire, they really enjoy telling people that their accounts have been banned, and they really enjoy implying that, yes, it was purely because of their political opinions.
[02:15:53.604 --> 02:15:59.367]  Now, because we had a law here in the United Kingdom, and it still is a law, it's still set to pass, although it's being amended.
[02:16:00.488 --> 02:16:01.929]  The Online Harms Bill.
[02:16:02.709 --> 02:16:07.172]  Headline, New dystopian law would give all social media users a truth score.
[02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:31.698]   So again, if you misgender the drag queen on Twitter, your truth score, saying that a man in a dress is still a man, that will negatively affect your truth score, like your credit score if you don't pay your bills, your truth score on social media goes down, you get put into the Red zone, the danger zone, and maybe the next time you go to the grocery store your payment is declined.
[02:16:31.718 --> 02:16:37.465]  We're going to get into who exactly has been banned and if any consequences are going to arise from that in the next segment.
[02:16:37.505 --> 02:16:38.867]  Summit.News.GoAway.
[02:16:39.087 --> 02:16:39.567]  We'll be back.
[02:16:40.569 --> 02:17:01.333]   So the PayPal purge accelerates and now questions are being asked in the British Houses of Parliament Over this, now that more prominent individuals have been deplatformed, debanked by the financial transaction giant, Reclaim the Net has the headline, PayPal bans the Free Speech Union, The Daily Skeptic and Toby Young.
[02:17:02.633 --> 02:17:15.656]  US tech giant PayPal has shut down multiple accounts associated with the Free Speech Union, a UK group that protects free speech, of course, and they actually are very successful in doing so in many cases, many of these high-profile cases.
[02:17:16.437 --> 02:17:19.058]  That get into the media and end up going to the courts.
[02:17:19.118 --> 02:17:30.644]  For example, the case of Harry Miller, who was interrogated and lost his job because he basically retweeted a limerick on Twitter that made fun of transgender people.
[02:17:30.664 --> 02:17:32.805]  He eventually ended up going to court.
[02:17:32.845 --> 02:17:37.467]  He won his case and that was very much with the help of the Free Speech Union.
[02:17:37.527 --> 02:17:43.270]  So this is a group that's been very successful in defending free speech legally and getting media attention.
[02:17:44.369 --> 02:17:51.875]  So it is a good thing that this is now getting the attention it deserves, but it had to happen off the back of them being banned.
[02:17:52.636 --> 02:18:00.823]  Young said PayPal started initiating closure of his personal account for his news website Daily Skeptic and the Free Speech Union last Thursday.
[02:18:00.863 --> 02:18:10.400]   And again, what you don't realize in this, and we're going to go to the video in a second because it gets into it a little bit more, is These debankings are happening all the time.
[02:18:10.420 --> 02:18:14.741]  They're happening to numerous right-of-center conservative personalities all the time.
[02:18:15.461 --> 02:18:23.002]  Back in 2018-2019, when this deplatforming was more of a new thing, everyone would talk about it.
[02:18:23.062 --> 02:18:29.604]  Everyone would talk about getting deplatformed by PayPal, Venmo, getting kicked off of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, whatever.
[02:18:30.293 --> 02:18:42.639]  And of course, the effect that that seemed to have was that if, for example, you got kicked off by Twitter and you went public about it, you made a big fuss about it, then Facebook would say, oh, well, if Twitter banned them, then we've got to ban them as well.
[02:18:43.120 --> 02:18:44.901]  And it would be a domino effect.
[02:18:44.961 --> 02:18:52.024]  It would be a cascade effect where if you made it public, then you'd lose that access to all these other accounts as well.
[02:18:52.544 --> 02:19:03.189]   So what we see now over the past two or three years Is tons of people getting debanked, getting deplatformed by both Big Tech and banking services.
[02:19:03.670 --> 02:19:05.111]  But they don't go public about it.
[02:19:05.151 --> 02:19:08.213]  They keep it quiet because they fear that domino effect.
[02:19:08.253 --> 02:19:11.295]  So we don't even know the amount of people who have been debanked.
[02:19:11.355 --> 02:19:18.680]  But since Toby Young and the Free Speech Union got debanked, a bunch of other people have come out and said that it happened to them.
[02:19:19.721 --> 02:19:23.344]  I'm going to tell you who else it happened to, but let's go to the video first.
[02:19:24.375 --> 02:19:26.857]  This is called The Truth About PayPal.
[02:19:27.097 --> 02:19:28.198]  We'll watch this and we'll be back.
[02:19:28.538 --> 02:19:31.940]  PayPal has come a long way since the days of Elon Musk and Peter Thiel.
[02:19:31.960 --> 02:19:34.402]  Since the halcyon days of the late 90s.
[02:19:34.522 --> 02:19:38.545]  Once everyone's favorite friendly and convenient payment processor.
[02:19:38.585 --> 02:19:40.826]  Giving financial freedom to the little man.
[02:19:40.866 --> 02:19:44.809]  Well now PayPal is a weaponized vicious tool of the regime.
[02:19:44.889 --> 02:19:48.131]  In the last week alone PayPal banned the free speech union.
[02:19:48.251 --> 02:19:52.112]  A group that, clues in the name, exists to legally defend free speech.
[02:19:52.152 --> 02:19:56.553]  They banned law or fiction, a group of lawyers that fights against vaccine mandates.
[02:19:56.593 --> 02:20:00.714]  They banned GAG, a group that fights against the sexualisation of minors.
[02:20:00.774 --> 02:20:02.254]  This is nothing really new.
[02:20:02.434 --> 02:20:06.955]  PayPal have been debanking people with anti-regime views for years.
[02:20:06.975 --> 02:20:12.456]  They previously banned left-wing news outlets that weren't sufficiently amplifying regime rhetoric.
[02:20:12.536 --> 02:20:16.777]  The reasons PayPal gives for banning people are of course completely spurious.
[02:20:16.697 --> 02:20:21.335]   proving that they're just satiating the demands of left-wing cancel culture mobs.
[02:20:21.335 --> 02:20:27.336]   In the case of the free speech union, PayPal responded to questions as to why they banned the account by citing
[02:20:27.336 --> 02:20:31.977]   "tolerance, diversity and respect for people of all backgrounds."
[02:20:31.977 --> 02:20:33.576]  What? What does that mean?
[02:20:33.755 --> 02:20:37.277]  Tolerance, diversity, and respect for people of all backgrounds.
[02:20:37.457 --> 02:20:40.558]  Except those people who say words that we don't agree with.
[02:20:40.678 --> 02:20:41.359]  Fuck them!
[02:20:41.479 --> 02:20:44.761]  It's completely arbitrary, bogus, nonsense.
[02:20:44.841 --> 02:20:46.722]  It's an insult to our intelligence.
[02:20:46.902 --> 02:20:47.902]  What's the solution?
[02:20:47.962 --> 02:20:49.783]  Well, don't use PayPal, obviously.
[02:20:49.883 --> 02:20:50.844]  Cancel your account.
[02:20:51.024 --> 02:21:00.229]  And support alt-tech startups that are trying to create fair payment processor platforms that don't ruin people's livelihoods for daring to engage in wrong things.
[02:21:00.370 --> 02:21:06.253]  Rumble did it for video hosting and their growth is exponential, so why can't we do it for payment processing?
[02:21:06.293 --> 02:21:11.436]  Well, small problem, Visa and Mastercard enjoy a virtual monopoly on payment processing.
[02:21:11.496 --> 02:21:13.437]  Nearly everything goes through them.
[02:21:13.497 --> 02:21:22.602]  Back in 2019, a left-wing activist group tried to force Mastercard to hold a vote, which would decide who could use their services based on political opinions.
[02:21:22.702 --> 02:21:23.303]  Imagine that.
[02:21:23.483 --> 02:21:25.004]  You go to pay for your groceries.
[02:21:25.144 --> 02:21:27.625]  Sorry, your credit card has been declined.
[02:21:27.765 --> 02:21:30.207]  You misgendered a drag queen on Twitter.
[02:21:30.307 --> 02:21:31.547]  Your account has been closed.
[02:21:31.648 --> 02:21:34.009]  And this is what I've been warning about for years.
[02:21:34.149 --> 02:21:37.611]  Deplatforming isn't about you losing your Twitter account.
[02:21:37.711 --> 02:21:40.372]  Cancel culture isn't about you losing your job.
[02:21:40.472 --> 02:21:45.295]  It's about losing your ability to even function in a normal society.
[02:21:45.375 --> 02:21:48.637]  It's about being denied the ability to have a bank account at all.
[02:21:48.677 --> 02:21:54.440]  To pay bills, to pay for a mortgage, to pay for car insurance, to pay for flights, to pay for food.
[02:21:54.480 --> 02:21:57.882]  Debanking is being fused with the cashless society.
[02:21:58.302 --> 02:22:02.584]  France are creating central bank digital currencies, CBDCs.
[02:22:02.644 --> 02:22:07.267]  This is the communist Chinese style social credit score in the West.
[02:22:07.567 --> 02:22:09.668]  It's here and it's only gonna get worse.
[02:22:09.708 --> 02:22:15.011]  They literally want you debanked, destitute, homeless, starving on the street.
[02:22:15.111 --> 02:22:22.735]  That's the end goal of deplatforming, of cancel culture, the complete and total subjugation of human existence.
[02:22:22.915 --> 02:22:24.838]  There's an easy way to avoid it all, though.
[02:22:24.858 --> 02:22:27.803]  Just keep those dangerous opinions to yourselves.
[02:22:27.904 --> 02:22:30.869]  Just sign over your soul to the regime.
[02:22:33.123 --> 02:22:34.224]  No, I mentioned it there.
[02:22:34.264 --> 02:22:51.133]  It was back in 2019, a left-wing lobby group was almost successful in getting Mastercard to hold a vote amongst their shareholders that would have instituted a new policy where they could terminate services to anyone if they expressed, quote, far-right political opinions.
[02:22:51.673 --> 02:23:01.859]  Now, we know what the new definition of far-right domestic extremism is because the President of the United States enunciates it on a daily friggin' basis.
[02:23:02.643 --> 02:23:06.027]  It's 75 million plus Trump voters.
[02:23:06.768 --> 02:23:11.134]  That's not a far-right extremist, that's a huge chunk of the population.
[02:23:11.674 --> 02:23:19.384]  Anyone, basically, who doesn't amplify regime narratives, whether they do that in public or whether they do it on social media.
[02:23:19.744 --> 02:23:35.424]   Now up until this point, Visa and Mastercard have resisted that, because of course, if you're literally banning people for the way they vote, not only is it totalitarianism, but it's going to eliminate a huge foundation of your customer base.
[02:23:36.044 --> 02:23:40.407]  Doesn't seem to bother PayPal, of course, with a wave of people cancelling their accounts.
[02:23:40.467 --> 02:23:44.210]  Boycott PayPal is trending on Twitter right now, whether that does anything.
[02:23:44.590 --> 02:23:46.252]  They're such a global behemoth.
[02:23:46.812 --> 02:23:49.354]  It's barely going to make a dent, isn't it, really, if you think about it.
[02:23:50.174 --> 02:23:57.518]  But in 2019, the CEO of Visa had to come out and said that he would promise not to block purchases of firearms.
[02:23:57.558 --> 02:24:00.160]  And again, it's this idea of this no-buy list, of course.
[02:24:00.740 --> 02:24:11.686]  Now we've got Visa and MasterCard saying they'll report gun purchases directly to the federal government, so they're only one step away from banning gun sales altogether via Visa and MasterCard.
[02:24:12.515 --> 02:24:20.137]  People, dissidents, have already been punished by not just big tech, not financial processes, but governments for their political opinions.
[02:24:20.577 --> 02:24:30.240]  Back in September last year, Australian authorities came out and said they would, quote, lock out unvaccinated people from being able to participate in the economy.
[02:24:31.041 --> 02:24:39.143]  We also had this headline from March of this year, Apple and Google payment systems block Russians causing chaos in Moscow metro system.
[02:24:39.901 --> 02:24:49.069]  This entire system was dependent on Apple Pay and Google Pay, and suddenly the switch was flipped, and you had massive queues at Moscow metros.
[02:24:49.409 --> 02:25:00.319]  People couldn't pay for their tickets because it was 100% totally dependent on these Google and Apple Pay systems, which things now increasingly are, especially with the QR codes.
[02:25:01.260 --> 02:25:04.683]  Now, it's not just the free speech group, Toby Young, that's being hit with this.
[02:25:05.791 --> 02:25:11.805]  Telegraph reports PayPal shuts account of parents group that campaigned to keep schools open during pandemic.
[02:25:12.707 --> 02:25:13.488]  So it's not only...
[02:25:14.457 --> 02:25:19.298]  You know, gays against groomers, people trying to protect children from sexualisation.
[02:25:19.758 --> 02:25:23.939]  It's not the Free Speech Union trying to protect people from cancel culture.
[02:25:24.359 --> 02:25:30.380]  It's parents' organisations that have lobbied because of the massive damage that lockdown was doing to their children.
[02:25:31.080 --> 02:25:36.102]  Speech delays, speech impediments, symptoms of autism rising 350% in America and in the United Kingdom.
[02:25:38.643 --> 02:25:50.300]  Trying to lobby, trying to create awareness to keep schools open, to fight against barbaric draconian lockdown policies that have now been vehemently discredited as a tool for dealing with the virus.
[02:25:50.985 --> 02:25:59.449]  Now those groups are impacted, so you'll see across the board it's nothing to do with hate, it's nothing to do with racism, it's nothing to do with extremism.
[02:25:59.709 --> 02:26:08.053]  It's any organisation, including left-wing organisations that were anti-war, that dissents from regime narratives.
[02:26:08.113 --> 02:26:12.655]  They're debanked, they're deplatformed, they're strangled, they're cut off.
[02:26:12.715 --> 02:26:17.717]  It is a tool of the regime, it's vicious, and people are finally starting to stand up against it.
[02:26:17.737 --> 02:26:18.257]  We'll be back.
[02:26:18.096 --> 02:26:39.736]  BackSummit.News, don't go away.
[02:26:39.736 --> 02:26:45.217]   So not only was Toby Young was the Daily Skeptic, which generally has been an anti-lockdown
[02:26:45.217 --> 02:26:50.896]   website questioning man-made climate change hysteria as well.
[02:26:49.631 --> 02:26:53.757]  Targeted shut down by the vicious regime tool that is PayPal.
[02:26:54.118 --> 02:26:58.584]  They also targeted a parents interest group in the United Kingdom.
[02:26:59.105 --> 02:27:04.473]  Telegraph reports PayPal shuts account of parents group that campaigned to keep schools open during pandemic.
[02:27:05.908 --> 02:27:14.070]  Parents Group that fought to keep schools open during the pandemic has become the latest to have their account shut down by PayPal due to the nature of its activities.
[02:27:14.130 --> 02:27:18.171]  And again, who decides woke employees within PayPal?
[02:27:18.211 --> 02:27:34.575]  That's who, at the behest of feverish left-wing cancel culture mobs using social media to brigade outrage and pressure these companies, not that they even need much pressure, into debanking both individuals and political lobby groups.
[02:27:35.618 --> 02:27:37.759]  That aren't far left-wing, that aren't pro-regime.
[02:27:38.600 --> 02:27:41.401]  Us for them said it had been unable to access thousands of pounds.
[02:27:41.461 --> 02:27:42.642]  Oh, that's the other thing they do.
[02:27:43.502 --> 02:28:00.152]  All the money that you've earned from PayPal, and people who've been using PayPal for 10, 15 years, all the commission they've given PayPal, the money that you earn that's in those PayPal accounts, they say, oh, not only are we going to cancel, close your account, you can't even get your own money out.
[02:28:00.792 --> 02:28:11.301]  Imagine that, going to the bank and saying, no, sorry, we're keeping your money for six months, for a year, maybe forever, while we assess the damages that you've caused us.
[02:28:11.721 --> 02:28:13.623]  They literally shut down your account.
[02:28:13.903 --> 02:28:15.324]  They cut off your livelihood.
[02:28:15.684 --> 02:28:20.768]  And then they accuse you of causing them damages and say they're going to steal your money.
[02:28:21.549 --> 02:28:26.213]  PayPal is not a safe or secure platform for any business.
[02:28:27.032 --> 02:28:35.796]  Mint Press, all these other left-wing news organizations, again, offered mild criticism of some of these wars and they got shut down.
[02:28:35.856 --> 02:28:45.061]  It's not just right-wing extremists, as the Biden administration has demonized 75 million plus Americans, it's anyone who can be targeted.
[02:28:45.101 --> 02:28:48.102]  This is not a safe platform anymore for anyone.
[02:28:48.543 --> 02:29:01.253]   They will not only shut you down and make you look stupid in the media, they will steal your money That's not illegal, apparently, to just steal people's money that they've legitimately earned.
[02:29:02.514 --> 02:29:09.095]  Comes as PayPal faces a backlash over its decision to shut down the accounts of the Free Speech Union, as we've explained.
[02:29:10.236 --> 02:29:11.036]  Then we have this.
[02:29:12.016 --> 02:29:15.597]  Actual question being asked in Parliament today, which is good to see.
[02:29:15.637 --> 02:29:16.897]  It's better than nothing, I guess.
[02:29:17.577 --> 02:29:19.658]  And there's going to be some kind of debate over that.
[02:29:21.078 --> 02:29:26.126]  But when asked why they shut down the free speech account, Toby Young said this.
[02:29:26.407 --> 02:29:28.109]  He didn't say what I'd done wrong.
[02:29:28.210 --> 02:29:30.193]  This was the employee on the phone call with him.
[02:29:31.428 --> 02:29:32.168]  Or in the email.
[02:29:32.609 --> 02:29:42.813]  But included this sentence implying that the rule I broke, and quote, PayPal's policy is not to allow our services to be used for activities that promote hate, violence or racial intolerance.
[02:29:42.853 --> 02:29:45.794]  Again, this website has nothing whatsoever to do with that.
[02:29:45.874 --> 02:29:48.835]  It mainly talks about vaccine injuries.
[02:29:49.275 --> 02:29:51.296]  Nothing to do with hate or intolerance.
[02:29:51.996 --> 02:30:00.480]  The one thing it has done, the Free Speech Union, is of course defended people who have upset the maniacal, deranged transgender LGBT lobby.
[02:30:01.627 --> 02:30:09.517]  So it says, for instance, last year we went into bat for the women's rights activist Kelly J Keane after she had a petition removed from change.org.
[02:30:10.498 --> 02:30:19.308]  A petition which had several thousand signatures asked the Oxford English Dictionary not to change the definition of woman from adult human female to something else.
[02:30:19.368 --> 02:30:27.908]   So they've got Small organizations that try to lobby for language not to be maliciously butchered by these organizations.
[02:30:28.008 --> 02:30:29.329]  No, you can't do that.
[02:30:29.389 --> 02:30:30.850]  You can't defend those people.
[02:30:31.130 --> 02:30:34.633]  We're going to remove your right to process financial transactions.
[02:30:35.033 --> 02:30:37.115]  Apparently to them, that's hate speech.
[02:30:38.356 --> 02:30:41.017]  In an interview with UnHerd, Toby Young came out today.
[02:30:41.037 --> 02:30:45.921]  He said, is this, he was asked, is this an existential threat to what you're doing?
[02:30:46.778 --> 02:30:55.003]  Basically, one third of all their financial transactions for the membership of their group, the Free Speech Union, were via PayPal.
[02:30:55.363 --> 02:31:02.967]  So if you've got 10,000, I think they've got 10,000 members, you get about 3,000 of those members paying their monthly fee via PayPal.
[02:31:02.987 --> 02:31:05.988]  That immediately cuts off a third of your revenue stream.
[02:31:06.769 --> 02:31:09.991]  He was asked if this was an existential threat to what he was doing.
[02:31:10.891 --> 02:31:12.252]  He said, no, we'll survive.
[02:31:13.061 --> 02:31:24.803]  In fact, I think we'll come back stronger and the FSU is going to try to get the law changed so PayPal and other financial service companies can't de-platform other people for expressing political views they disapprove of.
[02:31:25.483 --> 02:31:28.184]  I feel like saying to PayPal, you messed with the wrong guy.
[02:31:28.224 --> 02:31:31.784]  Well, you know, he's getting questions asked in Parliament.
[02:31:32.344 --> 02:31:40.966]  I know he's got certain friends within the Conservative Party, not that the Conservative government has really done anything for us in the course of the last, what, six or seven years.
[02:31:41.932 --> 02:31:58.563]  But again, this might be the straw that breaks the camel's back, at least forcing PayPal possibly to amend its policies where it can't arbitrarily just delete your account because of some, you know, pink-haired woke mob on Twitter saying that you're engaging in hate speech.
[02:31:58.883 --> 02:32:04.546]  And of course, their definition of hate speech is any opinion that they disagree with.
[02:32:05.687 --> 02:32:06.928]  They also have this headline.
[02:32:07.975 --> 02:32:11.937]  PayPal, Google execs to help Bank of England understand digital currency.
[02:32:12.537 --> 02:32:14.118]  Again, it's not just PayPal.
[02:32:14.138 --> 02:32:23.403]  They're now taking over all these other financial sectors in terms of payment processing, creating financial monopolies where they control everything.
[02:32:23.463 --> 02:32:29.687]  They control Venmo, which is why whenever people get banned by PayPal, the very same day they get banned by Venmo.
[02:32:30.687 --> 02:32:35.790]  Reclaim the Net reports the Biden administration is serious about considering a digital dollar.
[02:32:36.801 --> 02:32:51.484]  Last week's US Treasury Department report suggests the Biden administration is increasingly embracing the idea of moving forward with the Federal Reserve issuing a central bank digital currency, CBDC, although the decision has not yet been made.
[02:32:51.544 --> 02:33:05.286]  Again, further centralisation of the banking system, further risk of freezing out so-called MAGA extremists if they've been demonised and preventing them from engaging in basic commerce.
[02:33:06.121 --> 02:33:09.885]  Of course, this is all part of the Great Reset as we move towards a cashless society.
[02:33:11.287 --> 02:33:15.711]  WEF piece lauds how billions across the world complied with lockdown restrictions.
[02:33:16.753 --> 02:33:28.005]  This was an opinion piece published by the World Economic Forum, which apparently has no power and is a complete joke according to the legacy media, but all their policies seem to be unfurling at a rate of knots.
[02:33:28.917 --> 02:33:37.824]  Lords, how billions of people complied with restrictions imposed as a result of lockdown, suggesting they would do the same under the guise of reducing carbon emissions.
[02:33:37.844 --> 02:33:52.795]  And it goes back to this thing about climate lockdowns, where India was literally introducing climate lockdowns into some of its major cities, telling people that they'd be fined if they tried to drive their cars into certain areas of the city.
[02:33:53.726 --> 02:34:11.781]  The same time that was happening, literally the same day, Reuters was publishing fact checks, which were promoted by Twitter and all the other big tech platforms, saying that climate lockdowns were a conspiracy theory and they didn't exist on the very same day that India announced a climate lockdown.
[02:34:12.782 --> 02:34:16.885]  This article, published on the WEF website, is entitled My Carbon.
[02:34:17.443 --> 02:34:19.864]  An approach for inclusive and sustainable cities.
[02:34:20.405 --> 02:34:25.087]  And it basically explains that Covid, the Covid lockdowns, was a test of social responsibility.
[02:34:25.408 --> 02:34:29.010]  Despite the fact that we know the Covid lockdowns were absolutely devastating.
[02:34:29.450 --> 02:34:33.992]  Tens of thousands of untreated illnesses, depression, alcoholism, suicide.
[02:34:34.593 --> 02:34:38.475]  Sweden never locked down, they didn't have as many deaths as neighbouring Nordic countries.
[02:34:39.545 --> 02:34:51.093]  The lockdowns have been discredited, but here's the WEF, the Great Reset, lauding the fact that even though it was an outrage, everyone complied anyway, and that's what they're going to do with climate lockdowns.
[02:34:51.133 --> 02:34:51.674]  We'll be back.
[02:34:51.914 --> 02:34:52.935]  Summit.News.
[02:34:53.095 --> 02:34:53.655]  Don't go away.
[02:34:54.516 --> 02:35:13.768]   I want to get to this video now because while people are being debanked, deplatformed for questioning the current thing for not amplifying regime narratives, On Big Tech or using PayPal or other financial services simply to get by, to have their supporters donate to them, being debanked, being kicked off those platforms.
[02:35:14.503 --> 02:35:32.631]  In the streets of the United Kingdom it is still the case where even though they've been told to stop doing this, the police are interrogating and in many cases arresting people on the basis of them offending somebody by something they said.
[02:35:32.991 --> 02:35:35.912]  They've been told to stop doing it, they're still doing it.
[02:35:36.153 --> 02:35:41.897]   We had another example of it emerge just recently I'm going to come back and talk about it, but here's the video.
[02:35:42.357 --> 02:35:45.220]  Arrested for questioning the current thing.
[02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:45.801]  Let's roll it.
[02:35:46.621 --> 02:35:56.164]  Well, yet again, UK cops have been caught on camera acting like a thought police, so leave it or not, some protesters dared to undermine the current thing.
[02:35:56.184 --> 02:36:01.525]  Obviously, I know you're... There's no issues you're being here with the protests and stuff, I know you're here quite a lot.
[02:36:01.885 --> 02:36:05.186]  The issue is, is the flags, I'll be perfectly honest.
[02:36:05.266 --> 02:36:07.267]  So it's the flags again?
[02:36:07.287 --> 02:36:08.807]  It's the flags, right.
[02:36:08.847 --> 02:36:11.388]  I mean, they were carrying multiple flags, but one of them...
[02:36:12.188 --> 02:36:15.069]  Oh my God, one of them had these colours?!
[02:36:15.309 --> 02:36:16.289]  You aren't causing a noose at all.
[02:36:16.309 --> 02:36:16.569]  No, we're not.
[02:36:16.589 --> 02:36:21.291]  I want you to leave, peacefully leave, and cut the protest shortly, because you've upset people.
[02:36:21.431 --> 02:36:25.792]  Yeah, I'm upset every time I see an Extinction Rebellion clown blocking the road.
[02:36:25.812 --> 02:36:27.912]  Can you go and interrogate and arrest them?
[02:36:27.972 --> 02:36:29.313]  Because I'm upset.
[02:36:29.433 --> 02:36:36.035]  You've all taken offence to the Russian flag that you are displaying, as there is currently a war going on in Ukraine with Russia.
[02:36:36.195 --> 02:36:39.275]  That's a public order offence, and we've got offences that we have to deal with.
[02:36:39.575 --> 02:36:40.916]  And to do that we need details.
[02:36:41.756 --> 02:36:44.417]  And we need all of your details to then carry on the other thing.
[02:36:44.477 --> 02:36:50.018]  No, sorry, you don't get to decide what opinions I can express about a war under threat of arrest.
[02:36:50.098 --> 02:36:51.998]  So, right now I'm going to ask for all the details.
[02:36:52.018 --> 02:36:53.839]  If you don't give them, I've got powers to arrest you.
[02:36:53.979 --> 02:36:55.459]  Uh, no you fucking don't.
[02:36:55.519 --> 02:36:59.940]  You don't have the power to arrest someone because someone else claims they were offended.
[02:37:00.020 --> 02:37:04.901]  And that's why all these charges were eventually dropped and Essex Police is being sued.
[02:37:04.981 --> 02:37:05.901]  Russia is bad.
[02:37:06.021 --> 02:37:07.782]  They arrest political dissidents.
[02:37:08.242 --> 02:37:10.042]  Proceeds to arrest political dissidents.
[02:37:10.262 --> 02:37:12.803]  It's okay when we do it.
[02:37:12.863 --> 02:37:15.285]  They were all imprisoned overnight.
[02:37:15.365 --> 02:37:22.508]  And unbelievably, the activists were not only charged with disturbing the peace, but with inciting racial hatred.
[02:37:22.628 --> 02:37:22.868]  What?
[02:37:23.348 --> 02:37:23.989]  Against who?
[02:37:24.089 --> 02:37:29.091]  They were protesting against a war, against a cost-of-living crisis caused by that war.
[02:37:29.211 --> 02:37:31.152]  What the hell has that got to do with race?
[02:37:31.272 --> 02:37:34.414]  And they weren't just displaying Russian flags to cause aggro.
[02:37:34.514 --> 02:37:40.698]  The demonstrators said they held up a seven meter long bunting which contained the flags of every nation in the world.
[02:37:40.918 --> 02:37:46.241]  Our government has sent over two and a half billion pounds of our money to prolong this war.
[02:37:46.321 --> 02:37:48.983]  Of course we have the right to question it in public.
[02:37:49.083 --> 02:37:51.764]  How many times do the police have to be told?
[02:37:51.924 --> 02:37:54.826]  A person claiming they were offended by something.
[02:37:54.725 --> 02:37:57.044]  doesn't give you the power to arrest someone.
[02:37:57.044 --> 02:37:58.725]  How many f***ing times?
[02:37:58.725 --> 02:38:00.644]  Harry Miller won his case.
[02:38:00.644 --> 02:38:04.244]   The College of Policing came out after and clarified that the police can't take
[02:38:04.244 --> 02:38:08.885]   a disproportionate response to reports of a non-crime hate incident.
[02:38:08.885 --> 02:38:13.205]   That means, despite the absurdity of the existence of speech, which isn't a crime,
[02:38:13.205 --> 02:38:17.125]   but in bizarro clown world still represents a non-crime hate incident,
[02:38:17.125 --> 02:38:20.564]   you can't go around threatening, intimidating and arresting someone
[02:38:20.564 --> 02:38:26.084]   for basic free speech, To holding a flag that might offend someone, when anything
[02:38:26.084 --> 02:38:27.045]  can offend anyone.
[02:38:27.088 --> 02:38:28.649]  It's completely arbitrary.
[02:38:28.669 --> 02:38:35.274]  There are thousands upon thousands of Ukrainian flags being flown in villages, towns and cities across the entire country.
[02:38:35.314 --> 02:38:42.079]  You don't get to decide which flags are officially regime approved and which flags are offensive and therefore illegal.
[02:38:42.159 --> 02:38:43.219]  I'm still not finished.
[02:38:43.360 --> 02:38:44.721]  I'm still not finished.
[02:38:45.061 --> 02:38:49.044]  So right now you've got public order offences and we need to take your details.
[02:38:49.144 --> 02:38:49.424]  I'm sorry.
[02:38:49.484 --> 02:38:50.024]  No, no, no, no.
[02:38:50.924 --> 02:38:53.924]  So we're gonna arrest you, or you can arrest me.
[02:38:53.924 --> 02:38:54.924]  You can arrest me, and we'll all go.
[02:38:54.924 --> 02:38:57.924]   You don't have to say anything, but in my humble defense, you're not meant to remain questioned,
[02:38:57.924 --> 02:38:58.924]  some of which are later on in court.
[02:38:58.924 --> 02:39:00.924]  Anything you do say may be given evidence.
[02:39:00.924 --> 02:39:03.924]   That applies to all three of you, so if I can remove your phone now.
[02:39:03.924 --> 02:39:08.924]   Maybe the cops have spent just a bit too much time doing the Macarena at gay pride parades.
[02:39:08.924 --> 02:39:16.924]   Too little time learning and remembering what the actual frigging law is.
[02:39:17.477 --> 02:39:21.300]  Thankfully, as I said, these charges were dropped four months later.
[02:39:21.360 --> 02:39:25.944]  And those arrested and imprisoned are now taking legal action against Essex Police.
[02:39:25.984 --> 02:39:32.249]  Don't forget, there was national hand-wringing over anti-royalist protesters holding up offensive signs and being arrested.
[02:39:32.289 --> 02:39:33.970]  Where was the outrage over this?
[02:39:34.070 --> 02:39:36.311]  There wasn't a single news report about it.
[02:39:36.351 --> 02:39:39.091]  No blue checkmark on Twitter was bothered about it.
[02:39:39.131 --> 02:39:42.752]  And yet similar things continue to happen across the country again and again.
[02:39:42.772 --> 02:39:46.573]  They tell us they don't have the resources to respond to car thefts, to burglaries.
[02:39:46.593 --> 02:39:52.674]  But they have plenty of time to intimidate, interrogate and arrest people for expressing anti-regime opinions.
[02:39:52.814 --> 02:39:57.335]  I mean, no wonder the real criminals have no respect towards or fear of you.
[02:39:57.495 --> 02:40:00.636]  It's beyond the pale and it has to stop now.
[02:40:03.619 --> 02:40:05.961]  Remember, this isn't just happening on the streets.
[02:40:06.021 --> 02:40:14.088]  We had a story a couple of months ago where an ex-police officer posted offensive George Floyd memes in a chat group.
[02:40:14.268 --> 02:40:18.973]  But not a public chat group, a private chat group with his friends and colleagues.
[02:40:19.373 --> 02:40:20.594]  One of them ratted him out.
[02:40:20.934 --> 02:40:26.199]  He got 20 weeks in prison for posting offensive memes in a private chat group.
[02:40:26.439 --> 02:40:28.381]  He didn't even broadcast them to the world.
[02:40:29.153 --> 02:40:33.398]  Meanwhile, as I mentioned, they say they're not even going to come out and respond to burglaries anymore.
[02:40:33.859 --> 02:40:36.382]  Violent crime going up again in the major cities.
[02:40:36.802 --> 02:40:38.464]  They're not going to respond to car thefts.
[02:40:38.904 --> 02:40:44.231]  They've effectively been legalized in London and other major cities because they're just not investigated.
[02:40:44.938 --> 02:40:49.439]  But if you carry a flag that someone got offended by, oh, they'll arrest you.
[02:40:49.940 --> 02:40:55.101]  They were put in prison overnight, thankfully, because there's no foundation for that whatsoever.
[02:40:55.261 --> 02:40:59.943]  These police are now being sued, and the charges were eventually dropped.
[02:41:00.723 --> 02:41:10.946]  But yet again, we saw yesterday a guy who goes by the name Active Patriot asked a question about grooming gangs of police officers in Bradford, I think it was.
[02:41:11.952 --> 02:41:14.614]  Two minutes later they sent out a team to snatch him.
[02:41:15.194 --> 02:41:16.655]  He's in prison overnight.
[02:41:16.695 --> 02:41:17.996]  God knows where he is today.
[02:41:18.496 --> 02:41:23.980]  This continues to happen for political free speech on the streets of Britain.
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.661]  I'm talking about the current thing.
[02:41:27.522 --> 02:41:29.683]  Trump warns of World War Three.
[02:41:30.404 --> 02:41:36.487]  Says the conflict in Ukraine could spiral into World War Three after Russia launched a new military offensive.
[02:41:36.507 --> 02:41:40.979]   Of course they're talking about A new mobilization of 300,000 reservists.
[02:41:41.019 --> 02:41:43.100]  Some people say that's up to a million.
[02:41:44.241 --> 02:41:50.943]  Medvedev says nukes can be used to defend new Russian territories, warns hypersonic missiles can hit the EU and the US.
[02:41:51.804 --> 02:41:55.986]  Serbian president warns of great world conflict within two months.
[02:41:57.086 --> 02:42:04.049]  This is the president of Serbia, Alexander Vukic, who made the alarming comment during the first day of the UN General Assembly session in New York.
[02:42:05.094 --> 02:42:10.523]  He said, quote, I assume we're leaving the phase of the Special Military Operation and approaching a major armed conflict.
[02:42:10.643 --> 02:42:12.947]  Now the question becomes, where is the line?
[02:42:13.408 --> 02:42:19.598]  And whether after a certain time, maybe a month or two even, we will enter a great world conflict not seen since the Second World War.
[02:42:20.481 --> 02:42:36.231]  We got into this conflict, of course, because of our, in European terms, total dependency on Russian gas and energy, because we wanted to be the great saviors of the planet in the name of pursuing net zero, in the name of preventing climate change.
[02:42:36.531 --> 02:42:44.416]  We shut down all our industries, all our energy infrastructure that was producing good energy that would keep us going for decades and decades.
[02:42:45.189 --> 02:42:54.012]  Shut it all down in pursuit of disastrous green energy policies, completely dependent on Russian gas across Europe, in order to save the planet.
[02:42:54.052 --> 02:43:03.195]  Well, how good are we at saving the planet now, given that the prospect of nuclear war has moved ever closer, especially over the last 48 hours?
[02:43:04.156 --> 02:43:07.797]  Study says nuclear war could cause apocalyptic new ice age.
[02:43:07.857 --> 02:43:08.837]  Not could, would.
[02:43:09.958 --> 02:43:13.759]  So again, we're saving the planet by becoming completely dependent on Russian gas.
[02:43:14.511 --> 02:43:16.953]  That's going to be shut off as a part of this war.
[02:43:17.594 --> 02:43:23.418]  Well, how good are we at saving the planet when it's obliterated in a nuclear annihilation?
[02:43:23.999 --> 02:43:29.543]  New study says that a nuclear war would cause global temperatures to plunge by about 13 degrees Fahrenheit.
[02:43:29.583 --> 02:43:30.584]  Maybe they'll welcome it.
[02:43:31.084 --> 02:43:33.086]  I mean, it'll solve global warming, right?
[02:43:33.746 --> 02:43:38.230]  Triggering a nuclear little ice age that would lead to mass starvation.
[02:43:38.991 --> 02:43:43.034]  This was a study conducted by researchers at Louisiana State University.
[02:43:43.792 --> 02:43:54.937]  And they basically said, what we know already, nuclear firestorms, they release all the soot, goes into the upper atmosphere, blocks out the sun, you get crop failures around the world.
[02:43:55.418 --> 02:44:00.100]  It would kill off fishing, basically fishing across the entire planet would cease to exist.
[02:44:00.660 --> 02:44:04.422]  Ports, major ports would be completely frozen up by the new ice age.
[02:44:04.802 --> 02:44:21.897]  They wouldn't be able to get the food into major cities, mass starvation would occur, but I'm sure it was all worth it because we got to wave our little Ukrainian flags and we got to pretend like we were doing the good thing and we were saving the planet while actually blowing up the planet in a nuclear holocaust.
[02:44:21.997 --> 02:44:22.458]  Well done.
[02:44:22.718 --> 02:44:23.198]  Well done.
[02:44:23.258 --> 02:44:23.719]  Great work.
[02:44:24.412 --> 02:44:25.353]  Summit.News.
[02:44:25.473 --> 02:44:25.973]  We'll be back.
[02:44:26.053 --> 02:44:26.753]  Final segment.
[02:44:26.773 --> 02:44:27.454]  Don't go away.
[02:44:28.014 --> 02:44:39.320]  Of course, we had one of the funniest, masterful political trolls in modern history last week with the Martha's Vineyard migrant flights on behalf of, of course, Governor Ron DeSantis.
[02:44:40.060 --> 02:44:46.583]  Liberals showing that diversity maybe isn't such a strength in their minds when it happens in their backyards.
[02:44:47.104 --> 02:44:53.227]  And we see the example of Europe proving diversity to not be such a strength on a regular basis.
[02:44:54.011 --> 02:44:58.472]  We've had more ethnic riots in the United Kingdom over the past week.
[02:44:59.072 --> 02:45:00.732]  Headline here out of The Telegraph.
[02:45:01.313 --> 02:45:05.634]  Ongoing clashes between Muslims and Hindus could spread all over Britain.
[02:45:06.174 --> 02:45:11.755]  These unintegrated communities are basically now at war with each other on a low-level basis on the streets.
[02:45:12.535 --> 02:45:13.555]  Here's a video about that.
[02:45:13.615 --> 02:45:14.815]  I'll come back and talk about it.
[02:45:14.916 --> 02:45:16.976]  Come back and talk about some actual good news.
[02:45:17.036 --> 02:45:24.669]   Yes, there's a scintilla of good news in Europe, but first we'll go to this video It's called Trouble in Paradise.
[02:45:24.729 --> 02:45:25.291]  Let's roll it.
[02:45:26.476 --> 02:45:35.599]  Well, three different incidents occurred in the UK over the last week, which seem to suggest that we're going the way of Sweden, and that diversity may not be all it's cracked up to be.
[02:45:35.659 --> 02:45:43.061]  A man exposed his genitals to women and children who were queuing up to see the Queen lying in state in central London.
[02:45:43.121 --> 02:45:45.622]  The culprit was called Adio Adeshini.
[02:45:45.662 --> 02:45:46.623]  Good old British name.
[02:45:46.703 --> 02:45:53.505]  Another man stabbed two police officers, one female, during a feverish attack in Leicester Square, London.
[02:45:55.740 --> 02:45:58.081]  The culprit was called Mohammed Rahman.
[02:45:58.121 --> 02:45:58.961]  Good old British name.
[02:45:58.820 --> 02:46:05.239]   And during another incident, a man tried to rush and presumably desecrate the Queen's coffin as it was lying in
[02:46:05.239 --> 02:46:06.820]  state in central London.
[02:46:06.820 --> 02:46:17.820]  The culprit was called Mohammed Khan.
[02:46:18.321 --> 02:46:19.522]  Mmm, good old British name.
[02:46:19.602 --> 02:46:26.906]  Note that these incidents didn't happen in Scotland, they didn't happen in the Cotswolds, they didn't happen in Dorset, they happened in London.
[02:46:26.986 --> 02:46:36.873]  The perpetrator of the attempted desecration of the Queen's Coffin was from Tower Hamlets in East London, an area where white Brits make up less than 30% of the population.
[02:46:36.933 --> 02:46:45.459]  Meanwhile, in the multicultural city of Leicester, mobs of Muslims and Hindus fought running battles through the streets, with one Hindu temple being vandalised.
[02:46:45.759 --> 02:46:46.159]  We good to go.
[02:46:45.979 --> 02:46:47.979]  [crowd shouting]
[02:46:47.979 --> 02:46:49.979]  [crowd shouting]
[02:46:49.979 --> 02:46:51.979]  [crowd shouting]
[02:46:51.979 --> 02:46:53.979]  [crowd shouting]
[02:46:53.979 --> 02:46:55.979]  [crowd shouting]
[02:46:55.979 --> 02:46:57.979]  [crowd shouting]
[02:46:57.979 --> 02:47:03.979]   After ignoring these violent clashes for days, the BBC finally reported these culprits to be just, quote,
[02:47:03.979 --> 02:47:07.979]   "groups of young men", while parroting the general media line
[02:47:07.979 --> 02:47:11.979]   that the chaos was caused by a disagreement over a cricket match.
[02:47:11.926 --> 02:47:26.594]   Indeed, the mainstream media also appears to be extremely reluctant to describe clearly the nature of the clashes, with both the BBC and Sky News producing reports on Saturday's unrest, That managed to get all the way to the end without once mentioning that the people involved were Muslims and Hindus.
[02:47:26.453 --> 02:47:30.533]   Commenting on the violence, former Labour MP Claudia Webb said, quote,
[02:47:30.533 --> 02:47:36.693]   "Leicester is a shining example of how people from different cultures can live together side by side.
[02:47:36.693 --> 02:47:39.333]  Our diversity is what makes Leicester special.
[02:47:39.333 --> 02:47:45.413]   We are the city where the minorities make up the majority, and we are richer for this vibrant exchange of cultures."
[02:47:45.413 --> 02:47:49.734]   Yes, they're really calmly living together side by side, aren't they?
[02:47:55.172 --> 02:47:59.013]   They're really just engaging in a vibrant exchange of cultures.
[02:47:59.013 --> 02:48:01.013]  [Shouting]
[02:48:01.013 --> 02:48:04.373]  We're on Melton Road right now. Stand up with your Hindu mums.
[02:48:04.373 --> 02:48:08.852]  As you can see, look, they're throwing grass at us.
[02:48:08.852 --> 02:48:11.193]  (explosion)
[02:48:11.179 --> 02:48:17.964]  So, diversity, as you saw there, continues to be a strength in the United Kingdom, as it is across the rest of Europe.
[02:48:17.984 --> 02:48:27.047]   Headline here out of Remix News, Macron pushes to send migrants to French countryside labels plan an opportunity during demographic transition.
[02:48:27.228 --> 02:48:34.053]  Again, you talk about a demographic transition of a country in a negative way, then you're a dangerous right-wing extremist.
[02:48:34.533 --> 02:48:40.198]  You talk about the same transition in a positive way, then you're an enlightened elitist liberal.
[02:48:40.839 --> 02:48:47.105]  French President Emmanuel Macron has promised that a new asylum and immigration bill will be tabled from the beginning of next year.
[02:48:47.585 --> 02:48:51.569]  The French leader highlighting the need to send more migrants into the French countryside.
[02:48:51.889 --> 02:48:52.910]  I'm sure they'll love that!
[02:48:53.470 --> 02:48:56.233]  During France's, quote, demographic transition.
[02:48:56.293 --> 02:48:57.854]  Again, openly admitted!
[02:48:58.855 --> 02:49:05.201]  Macron is pushing for a better distribution of foreign nationals across France, especially in rural areas.
[02:49:05.976 --> 02:49:10.279]  He says it's because of the economic and social problems in the cities.
[02:49:10.720 --> 02:49:17.204]  Apparently the solution is to move those same economic and social problems out to the rural areas too.
[02:49:17.324 --> 02:49:18.105]  Good luck with that.
[02:49:18.745 --> 02:49:21.267]  Meanwhile in Germany, migrants only.
[02:49:21.327 --> 02:49:28.853]  The Greens plan to ban organic Germans from a third of job vacancies in the name of diversity slammed as unconstitutional.
[02:49:29.887 --> 02:49:34.590]  A third of vacancies within the city of Hanover will be reserved exclusively for migrant applicants.
[02:49:34.690 --> 02:49:39.273]  New proposals praised by the local Green Party, who are in power, have revealed.
[02:49:39.874 --> 02:49:41.715]  That's of course completely illegal.
[02:49:42.035 --> 02:49:46.418]  You can't discriminate by hiring people based on race or ethnicity alone.
[02:49:46.438 --> 02:49:51.661]  But apparently that's clearly what they want to do, despite the fact that in Germany it's clearly unconstitutional.
[02:49:51.681 --> 02:49:54.163]  Let's go to this final clip now though.
[02:49:55.077 --> 02:50:02.683]  A left-wing vlogger visited a migrant suburb of Sweden to prove how safe and wonderful and cosy it was.
[02:50:02.703 --> 02:50:05.706]  He ended up getting his watch robbed on the street.
[02:50:05.986 --> 02:50:07.507]  Let's go to this video.
[02:50:07.747 --> 02:50:09.128]  He didn't expect this.
[02:50:09.188 --> 02:50:09.749]  Let's roll it.
[02:50:10.882 --> 02:50:25.869]  Things didn't quite go to plan when a YouTube fitness vlogger visited the Swedish crime hotspot of Husby, a Stockholm suburb where the population has a 90% foreign-born background, in order to show how safe it was and to quote, spread good vibes.
[02:50:25.889 --> 02:50:27.670]  He ended up getting robbed on the street.
[02:50:27.730 --> 02:50:28.030]  Oops.
[02:50:28.250 --> 02:50:33.733]  Influencer Fabian GL was interviewing a man about living in the area when this happened.
[02:50:36.034 --> 02:50:36.315]  Habibi?
[02:50:36.335 --> 02:50:37.377]  Yes, Habibi, Habibi.
[02:50:37.397 --> 02:50:38.438]  You can call me that.
[02:50:38.498 --> 02:50:39.620]  My name is Habibi.
[02:50:39.640 --> 02:50:40.021]  Nice, nice.
[02:50:40.041 --> 02:50:40.882]  My name is Fabian.
[02:50:40.902 --> 02:50:42.084]  I just wanted to ask you a quick question.
[02:50:42.164 --> 02:50:42.866]  Are you from Husby?
[02:50:43.145 --> 02:50:58.074]   *Speaking in Swedish* Off camera the criminal threatened to shoot the vlogger if
[02:50:58.074 --> 02:50:59.704]  he didn't hand over his watch.
[02:50:59.704 --> 02:51:05.929]  Fabian told Express and Quote, they didn't take out a gun, but under the jacket of one of them, it looked like it was bulging out.
[02:51:06.029 --> 02:51:10.213]  The vlogger handed over the watch and the criminals on the electric scooter fled the scene.
[02:51:10.273 --> 02:51:20.781]  According to another report, when Fabian reported the crime to the police, a process which you can see in his video, instead of trying to hunt down the perpetrators, the cops interrogated Fabian.
[02:51:20.860 --> 02:51:24.380]  told him to stop filming and demanded that he leave Husby.
[02:51:24.380 --> 02:51:25.659]  That's so Sweden.
[02:51:25.659 --> 02:51:32.299]   While I'm unaware as to the nature of his content, Swedes emailed me to point out that Fabian GL is a leftist
[02:51:32.299 --> 02:51:38.219]   and he's been visiting these crime-ridden migrant ghettos to prove that diversity is in fact a strength.
[02:51:38.399 --> 02:51:50.250]  We previously visited another notorious migrant suburb, Rinkeby, where if you remember back in 2017, Tim Pool had to be escorted out by police for his own safety after being aggressively confronted by migrants.
[02:51:50.330 --> 02:52:00.879]  The Sweden Democrats have just become the second biggest party in the country, with the leftists who won 19 out of the previous 24 elections finally being voted out of office.
[02:52:00.939 --> 02:52:03.661]   And this video Really kinda shows why, doesn't it?
[02:52:03.701 --> 02:52:10.144]  Police in Sweden now say there are at least 60 neighbourhoods over which they have no control whatsoever.
[02:52:10.224 --> 02:52:15.527]  Riots in these areas have become commonplace in response to police arresting violent criminals.
[02:52:15.567 --> 02:52:21.430]  There have been 500 bombings in Sweden, including grenade attacks, since 2018 alone.
[02:52:21.530 --> 02:52:23.951]  Gang violence is spiralling out of control.
[02:52:24.011 --> 02:52:30.735]  And unfortunately, no amount of feel-good propaganda can cover up for this total failure of multiculturalism.
[02:52:33.505 --> 02:52:48.228]  Well, we see the consequences of that across Europe now, and this is the sliver of good news that we learn, with right-wing anti-mass migration parties coming to power in European countries, in many cases in unprecedented circumstances.
[02:52:48.268 --> 02:52:51.229]  We have the Sweden Democrats, second biggest party now in Sweden.
[02:52:52.329 --> 02:52:58.831]  Now, Remix News reports Maloney on course to become Italy's PM, despite demonization by left and thinly veiled threats from the EU.
[02:53:00.259 --> 02:53:08.843]  The right-wing bloc looks set to have an absolute majority in Italy, in both Houses of Parliament, possibly even thanks to an electoral reform push through by the left.
[02:53:09.524 --> 02:53:11.465]  A constitutional majority.
[02:53:11.545 --> 02:53:16.187]  Their anti-mass migration and their anti-EU membership.
[02:53:16.267 --> 02:53:17.347]  That is Italy.
[02:53:17.367 --> 02:53:21.489]  This election, this coming Sunday is their election day.
[02:53:21.529 --> 02:53:22.230]  She's going to win.
[02:53:22.430 --> 02:53:24.791]  Very clearly the numbers aren't even close.
[02:53:25.411 --> 02:53:26.512]  And also in Austria.
[02:53:27.202 --> 02:53:31.968]  Austria's record influx of illegal immigrants could swing presidential election to the right.
[02:53:32.509 --> 02:53:38.316]  Austria's government is under pressure to tackle its border crisis after 3,000 illegal immigrants entered the country this week.
[02:53:38.356 --> 02:53:44.203]  That is a new record for Austria, surpassing a record reached in the first week of September.
[02:53:44.949 --> 02:53:50.850]  They've had 47,000 people so far crossing into Austria, which is up from just 19,000 in 2021.
[02:53:51.130 --> 02:53:55.991]  So they're seeing similar levels to the United Kingdom.
[02:53:56.711 --> 02:54:01.452]  Up to 100,000 will cross by the end of the year, they're predicting, in Austria.
[02:54:02.292 --> 02:54:08.453]  And the pro-refugee, pro-mass migration leader of Austria is in trouble in the polls.
[02:54:08.533 --> 02:54:11.114]  So again, more good news in Europe.
[02:54:12.108 --> 02:54:15.951]  German authorities have been operating hundreds of fake far-right social media accounts.
[02:54:16.512 --> 02:54:18.934]  Similar situation to Biden demonizing Americans.
[02:54:19.314 --> 02:54:30.943]  This supposed domestic extremist right-wing terror threat is so vast, is so serious, is so immediate that the authorities literally have to create it out of nothing.
[02:54:31.263 --> 02:54:37.668]  We've known for decades that the far-right in Germany was completely infiltrated and controlled by the authorities.
[02:54:38.109 --> 02:54:50.126]   Now it turns out all the big Right-wing social media accounts in Germany are also controlled by the German authorities because the threat of right-wing extremism is so massive that they have to generate it out of nothing.
[02:54:50.146 --> 02:54:51.187]  I'm going to wrap it up.
[02:54:51.287 --> 02:54:52.890]  Summit.News, War Room is next.
[02:54:52.849 --> 02:55:02.688]  Don't go away.
[02:55:02.793 --> 02:55:04.294]  It's really a philosophical question.
[02:55:04.334 --> 02:55:05.494]  It's hard to answer directly.
[02:55:05.935 --> 02:55:06.335]  Let's see.
[02:55:06.835 --> 02:55:10.478]  How drunk was the guy you saw passed out in the men's room at a Packers game?
[02:55:11.298 --> 02:55:13.840]  How angry is Hillary Clinton at her husband?
[02:55:14.200 --> 02:55:15.921]  Well, the answer in all cases is very.
[02:55:16.422 --> 02:55:16.962]  Extremely.
[02:55:17.382 --> 02:55:19.944]  So thoroughly and so totally that it's hard to put into words.
[02:55:20.304 --> 02:55:25.748]  So instead of describing the dishonesty of the New York Times with conventional adjectives, we'll give you a specific example.
[02:55:26.288 --> 02:55:27.388]  Because we think it tells you more.
[02:55:27.408 --> 02:55:35.990]  So last week, the paper told us that the best-selling book in the United States was a title called, I'm Glad My Mom Died, by a child actress called Jeanette McCurdy.
[02:55:36.630 --> 02:55:37.791]  But that was not true.
[02:55:37.891 --> 02:55:40.491]  That book was not the best-selling book in America.
[02:55:40.591 --> 02:55:47.993]  In fact, the best-selling book in America last week was The Great Reset and the War for the World, written by Alex Jones.
[02:55:48.493 --> 02:55:52.214]  Jones sold more than 56,000 copies of his book last week.
[02:55:52.754 --> 02:55:59.415]  Jennifer McCurdy, whatever her merits, we have no idea, sold 34,686 copies of her book.
[02:55:59.935 --> 02:56:02.716]  So Alex Jones sold a lot more books.
[02:56:02.796 --> 02:56:05.136]  Alex Jones has the biggest book in the country.
[02:56:05.156 --> 02:56:08.037]  But the New York Times lied about that because the New York Times doesn't want you to know that.
[02:56:08.057 --> 02:56:12.697]  The New York Times wants you to believe that Alex Jones is more discredited than the New York Times.
[02:56:13.137 --> 02:56:17.818]  The paper that started the Iraq War by lying about weapons of mass destruction and got a million people killed.
[02:56:18.138 --> 02:56:19.339]  But Alex Jones is worse!
[02:56:19.899 --> 02:56:20.799]  He's a mental patient.
[02:56:20.839 --> 02:56:21.739]  No one listens to him.
[02:56:23.186 --> 02:56:23.966]  So they lied about his book.
[02:56:24.686 --> 02:56:25.587]  What else are they lying about?
[02:56:26.187 --> 02:56:26.587]  You wonder.
[02:56:27.247 --> 02:56:34.289]  Since you mentioned the great recent The War of the World that you championed, and I really appreciate you reading it, it's mainly, it was easy to write, it's their quotes, it's their battle plan.
[02:56:34.669 --> 02:56:37.450]  What if people would have read Mein Kampf that Hitler wrote?
[02:56:37.890 --> 02:56:39.390]  Everything he said in the book, he did.
[02:56:39.650 --> 02:56:40.971]  Well, this is their Mein Kampf.
[02:56:41.171 --> 02:56:42.771]  This is their admissions right here.
[02:56:42.811 --> 02:56:43.771]  This is their confessions.
[02:56:44.051 --> 02:56:45.852]  That's why I call it the blueprint of the Death Star.
[02:56:46.392 --> 02:56:47.754]  No, listen, here's the beauty of the book.
[02:56:48.134 --> 02:56:49.396]  You actually quote them at length.
[02:56:49.416 --> 02:56:55.444]  You take a couple of the top books, you take a couple of the top thinkers, you tie it all together, and this is what people have to understand.
[02:56:55.764 --> 02:56:59.448]  Look, once you read this, you'll understand what we're up against, okay?
[02:56:59.649 --> 02:57:04.595]  You'll understand exactly what this apparatus, you know, what Alex calls it the Death Star.
[02:57:04.815 --> 02:57:06.175]  But you understand what we're up against.
[02:57:06.215 --> 02:57:07.355]  And we're not going to back off this.
[02:57:07.375 --> 02:57:08.216]  We can't back off it.
[02:57:08.236 --> 02:57:10.916]  The United States is actually the centerpiece of this battle.
[02:57:11.176 --> 02:57:17.817]  Because they understand, just like in the Revolutionary War, if they can take the liberty and freedom of American citizens, they can take it anywhere.
[02:57:18.157 --> 02:57:19.538]  And that's why you have to fight back.
[02:57:19.578 --> 02:57:22.458]  And by the way, Alex, I not just read it, I tell everybody, get a pen.
[02:57:22.478 --> 02:57:23.798]  I always get my great pens here.
[02:57:24.098 --> 02:57:26.279]  I had my pen and I'm underlining everything.
[02:57:26.459 --> 02:57:27.399]  And here's the beauty of it.
[02:57:27.619 --> 02:57:28.719]  You footnote everything.
[02:57:28.759 --> 02:57:30.399]  This is not Alex Jones's opinions.
[02:57:30.820 --> 02:57:37.696]   What Alex Jones's team has done is pulled it all together It's all referenced right there.
[02:57:37.736 --> 02:57:38.738]  You can go to a footnote.
[02:57:38.979 --> 02:57:40.902]  I know you've got an online site about it, too.
[02:57:40.962 --> 02:57:44.428]  That's why I think Tony Lyons and the guys at Skyhorse did such a great job.
[02:57:44.468 --> 02:57:44.849]  But listen.
[02:57:45.499 --> 02:57:50.640]  Once you read this book, you understand why the Alex Joneses and the Steve Bannons are not going to back off.
[02:57:50.660 --> 02:57:52.220]  There's all kind of other things we could do.
[02:57:52.240 --> 02:57:54.101]  There's all kind of other things Trump could do.
[02:57:54.121 --> 02:57:55.841]  There's all kind of other things Tucker Carlson could do.
[02:57:56.141 --> 02:57:57.181]  We're all in this fight.
