[00:00:00.953 --> 00:00:10.256]  The globalists have said in their white papers, in their own UN documents, that they want to create race-specific bioweapons and other systems to depopulate the planet.
[00:00:10.476 --> 00:00:17.638]  A lot of this, from my sources, is that they're preparing to release bioweapons, claiming that they're naturally occurring.
[00:00:18.098 --> 00:00:24.306]  And then use that as the cover for civil emergency, societal control, crackdowns on free speech.
[00:00:24.326 --> 00:00:27.070]  Obama put the internet kill switch in five years ago.
[00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.778]  And when he got confronted by Congress, he said, well, it's in case the bird flu or SARS gets out.
[00:00:33.058 --> 00:00:36.540]  And they have to control panic and direct every website in the U.S.
[00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:38.321]  to one government announcement.
[00:00:38.422 --> 00:00:46.587]  And we looked at every angle and believe a bioweapon release could be the thing they'd release to bring in a world government to counter a global problem.
[00:00:46.787 --> 00:00:47.307]  And the U.N.
[00:00:47.327 --> 00:00:52.050]  has said that a global pandemic is the only thing that may save their world government.
[00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:59.175]  Mike Adams and I were on air saying if they have these lockdowns for more than just a few months and around the world, it's still ongoing in some areas.
[00:00:59.655 --> 00:01:00.556]  Is the IMF a World Bank?
[00:01:01.874 --> 00:01:06.436]  Controls these terrible countries in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa.
[00:01:06.456 --> 00:01:11.599]  And they say, if you want the money, you've got to lock people down and say they're not essential.
[00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.233]  Is it possible to prevent the next pandemic?
[00:01:16.273 --> 00:01:21.277]  Yes, if every country does what Australia did, then you wouldn't be calling it a pandemic.
[00:01:23.019 --> 00:01:23.419]  That's all.
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.005]  So it's a short-term thing that these leaders get to enslave their own people, and it puts the UN in charge and in control.
[00:01:30.045 --> 00:01:35.830]  Now the UN is trying to get a treaty passed where they have control of all pandemic responses now.
[00:01:36.131 --> 00:01:37.752]  So we're going into world government.
[00:01:37.772 --> 00:01:39.293]  We're going into the new world order right now.
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.920]  And so this is just mathematics.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:50.982]  If you cut off the fertilizer, if you cut off the oil and the natural gas, if you lock people down around the world, it's going to cause a collapse.
[00:01:52.022 --> 00:01:54.243]  And so there's no doubt we're in a collapse.
[00:01:54.783 --> 00:01:57.384]  There's no doubt we're in inflation and hyperinflation.
[00:01:57.664 --> 00:02:03.505]  The question is, how bad will it get in different sectors of the world, and what's coming here, and how do we get ready?
[00:02:03.945 --> 00:02:11.368]   And these supply chain breakdowns are also going to permanently destroy Literally hundreds of thousands of small businesses across America.
[00:02:11.728 --> 00:02:14.750]  I interviewed a business owner just the other day asking about these questions.
[00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:27.377]  He is able to adapt and barely able to get supplies and keep his business operating, but a lot of businesses, once they hit one month where they can't get supplies, just one month, many of these businesses will have to liquidate.
[00:02:27.677 --> 00:02:33.481]  So they will sell off the equipment, they will lose the employees, and they lose the knowledge base of how to make things.
[00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:41.047]   It's important for people to understand that what has already been set into motion Including the economic sanctions against Russia by Western nations.
[00:02:41.588 --> 00:02:51.198]  This will spell, really, inflation doom for the next one to two years, affecting the food supply, energy supply, and of course many other things.
[00:02:51.238 --> 00:03:10.671]   And then, I know you want to bring this in, but the Shanghai lockdowns in China, which I believe are contrived in order to punish the West, That's also going to worsen the supply chain disruptions and make it almost impossible for American companies to get supplies or even build homes to acquire resins or electronic parts.
[00:03:10.731 --> 00:03:15.673]  I mean, Taiwan companies that operate in China have had to shut down their factories.
[00:03:16.033 --> 00:03:19.694]  So they can't even ship out of Taiwan now because they can't get their stuff out of China.
[00:03:19.994 --> 00:03:21.755]  China is trying to punish the West.
[00:03:22.435 --> 00:03:30.097]  They're trying to break the economies of the United States and Western Europe, and they're willing to lock down and really murder their own people in order to achieve that.
[00:03:30.457 --> 00:03:42.380]  Remember that the Shanghai lockdowns are not only affecting the port operations there, they're affecting domestic trucking, which means that the supply chain to the factories in Shanghai is also now completely broken.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.261]  You can't even get a supply truck from somewhere else in China to come into Shanghai to supply a factory there.
[00:03:48.721 --> 00:04:04.424]  So this also means that you can't get containers for international shipping, even in other countries, such as Taiwan and Japan and South Korea, which have their own exports, but they're having a very difficult time getting containers because they're all log jammed in Shanghai.
[00:04:04.664 --> 00:04:14.786]  You've got Biden with 20-something approval ratings, 94% of folks blame him for inflation, so it looks like the libtards are finally starting to get it, but is it too little too late?
[00:04:15.126 --> 00:04:27.975]  Well, I think it is because the other thing that's going to be set off by this is a massive wave of starving migrants from South America, and they're going to be coming across the border because of what Biden is doing to open up the border.
[00:04:28.635 --> 00:04:38.842]  And as the food inflation and fuel inflation worsens, these people are going to suffer collapse in their own nations in Central and South America, and they're going to be streaming into North America.
[00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:46.587]   So if people thought the situation was bad right now in terms of illegal immigration and a migrant invasion, It's going to get far, far worse.
[00:04:46.767 --> 00:04:52.912]  So we're really looking at a global collapse of the ability of people to buy food and fuel.
[00:04:53.072 --> 00:05:00.072]   If the public isn't smart enough to get that, they better wake up fast or they're dead.
[00:05:01.072 --> 00:05:07.072]   If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:12.247]  Live from Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:05:14.944 --> 00:05:16.245]  Easter 2022.
[00:05:16.425 --> 00:05:18.286]  I want to thank the great crew for being here tonight.
[00:05:18.306 --> 00:05:26.812]  I want to thank all the amazing listeners and viewers for spending this very important Christian holiday with us when our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ rose from the dead.
[00:05:27.512 --> 00:05:29.334]  It is Sunday, April 17th.
[00:05:29.354 --> 00:05:29.974]  The year is 2022.
[00:05:30.114 --> 00:05:33.536]  We'll be here tonight for the next four hours.
[00:05:33.577 --> 00:05:39.861]  You've got two hours of Alex Jones and then coming up Owen Schroer with the Vaunted Sunday Live 6 to 8 p.m.
[00:05:40.301 --> 00:05:44.584]  Central Standard Time ahead of all the weekday shows as well here on the Info Wars.
[00:05:45.328 --> 00:05:46.900]  Pro-human, pro-liberty network.
[00:05:49.192 --> 00:05:53.135]  Well, we have a lot of big economic news on the hyperinflation, just how bad it's going to get.
[00:05:53.195 --> 00:06:06.785]  We have a lot of big developments in the ongoing Ukraine-NATO-Russia proxy war, the sinking of the battleship and the Russians threatening tactical weapons, nuclear weapons, the West threatening the use of tactical nuclear weapons.
[00:06:07.425 --> 00:06:13.870]  We also have a federal court admitting that Biden ordered last year alone the release of 756,000 illegal aliens.
[00:06:17.193 --> 00:06:23.897]  We've broken the law and come to the US and that's they're estimating about 1 out of 10 that comes across the border.
[00:06:23.937 --> 00:06:25.398]  They actually even catch and release.
[00:06:25.458 --> 00:06:31.342]  So the number is 10 times the Border Patrol predicts of the 756,000 number.
[00:06:31.742 --> 00:06:38.486]  So we're talking close to 8 million people and that's what the Border Patrol told us.
[00:06:39.927 --> 00:06:41.668]  Just three or four months ago, we were down the Texas border.
[00:06:41.708 --> 00:06:44.250]  They said we believe that in fiscal year.
[00:06:46.817 --> 00:06:50.240]  2021, between 5 and 8 million illegal aliens actually got into the U.S.
[00:06:50.721 --> 00:06:52.423]  This is beyond unprecedented.
[00:06:52.443 --> 00:06:53.544]  We've got all of that.
[00:06:55.826 --> 00:07:04.454]  We have a lot of Elon Musk's Twitter censorship news, a lot of election news, so much here today.
[00:07:06.016 --> 00:07:07.618]  But let's plunge into Easter right now.
[00:07:08.973 --> 00:07:22.422]  Now let's talk about this, because you have globalist corporate interests that have seized control of the main Catholic Church, many of the Protestant churches, they're in control of the universities, they're in control of the banks, they're in control of most of the governments.
[00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:30.693]  And now you've got this Pope coming out, Pope Francis, his main Good Friday message, we are racist, we are racist.
[00:07:30.773 --> 00:07:38.556]  This is an InfoWars.com article, it links to the Vatican newspaper, with his main message on Easter is that white people are bad.
[00:07:39.196 --> 00:07:46.478]  And we should open our borders up, because the globalists are opening the borders, flooding us with third-world populations they control to economically conquer us.
[00:07:46.558 --> 00:07:49.458]  It's not that the third-world populations are bad, necessarily.
[00:07:49.939 --> 00:07:54.780]  The point is that the globalists are conquering us, using this with, quote, replacement migration.
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.301]  And so here's the Pope saying, you are racist.
[00:07:58.341 --> 00:08:04.202]  The new woke religion of the West is, do what we say, give up all your liberties, give up all your freedoms.
[00:08:05.834 --> 00:08:08.436]  Or, we're gonna call you racist.
[00:08:08.476 --> 00:08:09.936]  That's all this is.
[00:08:11.077 --> 00:08:18.281]  And it's the same type of globalist message you see from Disney, and Hollywood, and the whole woke crowd.
[00:08:18.301 --> 00:08:23.264]  You compare what the Pope says to Peter Wood, and man, it is the same script.
[00:08:23.304 --> 00:08:25.245]  Because who hijacked the Catholic Church?
[00:08:25.686 --> 00:08:27.607]  The same pedo cult, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:28.087 --> 00:08:30.188]  And here's another disgusting thing on the New York Times.
[00:08:30.568 --> 00:08:34.331]  New York Times, for the Holy Week op-ed, let's kill God!
[00:08:35.467 --> 00:08:38.470]  Says, in this time of war, I propose we give up God.
[00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:45.477]  It says God is the fault of everything, and the Bible particularly, and Christians.
[00:08:45.898 --> 00:08:46.258]  Wow.
[00:08:46.579 --> 00:08:50.442]  Always, always an anti-Christian message.
[00:08:50.503 --> 00:08:51.524]  And of course, we've got this.
[00:08:51.944 --> 00:08:55.267]  The UK government officially is a dehumanization cult.
[00:08:56.596 --> 00:09:17.049]  UK House Office, UK Home Office accused of compelling speech, ordering staff to put pronouns in email signatures with the 56 different genders and the total brainwashing and control to end the family structure as we know it, which is the Tavistock Institute London, England plan as well.
[00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:21.192]  And that ties into this that's really going viral right now.
[00:09:21.372 --> 00:09:22.473]  And it's on local news.
[00:09:23.233 --> 00:09:24.034]  It's not a joke.
[00:09:24.674 --> 00:09:25.695]  It's absolutely real.
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.185]  It's not just a parent now we're learning.
[00:09:29.607 --> 00:09:31.252]  These elementary schools are captured.
[00:09:32.301 --> 00:09:39.924]  Pedo facilities, where they parade the children chanting and learning how to use sex toys when they're five years old without parental consent.
[00:09:39.984 --> 00:09:41.785]  I mean, serious pedophile stuff.
[00:09:42.125 --> 00:09:48.527]  If some pervert at a park walked over trying to talk to your six-year-old daughter about a sex toy, you'd break their jaw.
[00:09:48.907 --> 00:09:50.248]  And the police would give you a medal for it.
[00:09:50.568 --> 00:09:54.110]  But if you're a pervert administering an elementary school, you are worshipped.
[00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:59.972]  Parent dressed as Easter Bunny, hands out condoms at Texas Elementary School, New York Post, Forrester's Telegram.
[00:10:01.291 --> 00:10:04.912]  Parent in bunny suit hands out condom-filled Easter eggs at Texas Elementary School.
[00:10:05.292 --> 00:10:06.273]  You ask why they do this?
[00:10:06.353 --> 00:10:08.233]  Because they are marking your children.
[00:10:08.553 --> 00:10:09.834]  They are dominating your children.
[00:10:10.134 --> 00:10:12.134]  They are letting them know that they are in charge.
[00:10:12.154 --> 00:10:14.555]  They're going to ruin their innocence forever.
[00:10:15.195 --> 00:10:19.376]  And that ties into this Zero Hedge article that's also on Infowars.com.
[00:10:19.937 --> 00:10:20.797]  Michigan School.
[00:10:22.179 --> 00:10:34.105]  Under fire, you can get rid of yourself, after student leaks, McCarthyist questionnaire about your parents' politics, do they own guns, everything about them for the leftist to put it into an Antifa database.
[00:10:34.645 --> 00:10:37.107]  That is coming up today as well.
[00:10:37.447 --> 00:10:40.148]  You know, did the Pope come out and speak out against Planned Parenthood?
[00:10:40.228 --> 00:10:40.909]  No, no, no, no.
[00:10:41.189 --> 00:10:42.169]  Or human animal cloning?
[00:10:42.229 --> 00:10:42.850]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.291]  Or human smuggling and trafficking?
[00:10:45.331 --> 00:10:45.471]  No.
[00:10:47.754 --> 00:10:57.377]  Exclusive after specializing in abortions and baby parts sales for decades, Planned Parenthood now raking in dollars, hundreds of millions a year in transgender services.
[00:10:58.238 --> 00:11:01.319]  However they can, they're going to sterilize you.
[00:11:01.359 --> 00:11:03.940]  So that's just some of what we've got.
[00:11:05.117 --> 00:11:11.479]  The full Mark Dice video, my good friend Mark Dice, is on InfoWars.com, but if you want to see the whole thing, it's there.
[00:11:11.499 --> 00:11:25.144]  But here's a few minutes as we go to break of the latest Mark Dice video, where the leftist woke mob in California, the majority of them, sign a petition to arrest people that read out of the Bible, which the left calls hate speech.
[00:11:25.164 --> 00:11:26.204]  You say, well that's not coming here.
[00:11:26.484 --> 00:11:27.184]  It's already here.
[00:11:27.484 --> 00:11:34.526]   In Canada and in Europe and the UK, they arrest people that read pro-family passages out of the Bible.
[00:11:34.926 --> 00:11:36.406]  Here is part of the Mark Dice's report.
[00:11:36.766 --> 00:11:39.047]  Just how far is the left censorship going to go?
[00:11:39.267 --> 00:11:41.847]  Will Americans sign a petition to ban the Bible?
[00:11:42.267 --> 00:11:42.987]  Let's find out.
[00:11:43.268 --> 00:11:44.608]  Will you help us to ban the Bible?
[00:11:44.628 --> 00:11:46.208]  To ban the Bible?
[00:11:46.588 --> 00:11:50.309]  We're just trying to get rid of this hate speech just to help the New World Order.
[00:11:50.449 --> 00:11:55.650]  But Amazon is still selling it to a lot of people and we're just trying to get them to stop that.
[00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:56.970]  Why would I want to ban the Bible?
[00:11:57.748 --> 00:12:00.129]  Well, you know, it makes a lot of people feel uncomfortable.
[00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:03.450]  It's hurting a lot of people's feelings.
[00:12:05.051 --> 00:12:08.852]  Just print here and, yeah, print birthdate and a signature.
[00:12:08.872 --> 00:12:14.375]  You know, the Bible hurts a lot of people's feelings, and it makes a lot of people feel uncomfortable.
[00:12:15.655 --> 00:12:20.557]  And if we can get rid of it, you know, that'll really help with the New World Order.
[00:12:21.457 --> 00:12:21.957]  And she signs.
[00:12:21.977 --> 00:12:24.939]  A lot of people want to burn the existing ones, but maybe we can do that later.
[00:12:26.112 --> 00:12:26.472]  Thank you.
[00:12:27.193 --> 00:12:33.477]  Amazon has finally stopped selling a lot of racist and anti-semitic books by people like former KKK leader David Duke.
[00:12:33.517 --> 00:12:36.159]  They were selling his autobiography for years.
[00:12:36.659 --> 00:12:44.445]  They finally stopped selling it, but they're still selling the Bible, so we're just trying to... So I'm just signing to not have the Bible be sold on Amazon?
[00:12:44.485 --> 00:12:44.705]  Yeah.
[00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:49.008]  Okay, that sounds like a good thing for humanity.
[00:12:49.890 --> 00:13:00.057]  You know, if somebody already purchased one, you know, I mean, at least at this point, we're not going to confiscate them, maybe in the future, but we just don't want anybody else to be purchasing their copies.
[00:13:00.097 --> 00:13:00.437]  Good luck!
[00:13:00.537 --> 00:13:00.957]  Thank you.
[00:13:00.977 --> 00:13:02.198]  Have a good one.
[00:13:02.218 --> 00:13:04.740]  When you say hate speech, I want to make sure we're on the same page.
[00:13:05.799 --> 00:13:13.808]  Yeah, well the Bible has a lot of homophobia in there and you know it says that the Jews conspired to have Jesus killed.
[00:13:13.888 --> 00:13:20.115]  It's an anti-semitic trope so we're just trying to get the Bible banned to help stop the hate speech.
[00:13:21.036 --> 00:13:22.258]  On board with you there.
[00:13:22.318 --> 00:13:23.259]  On board with us there.
[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:34.416]  You know, I mean, for the people who have already bought one, I mean, at least at this point, we're not going to be confiscating them, maybe in the future, but we're just trying to get the new purchases stopped and just ban it from all the stores.
[00:13:35.437 --> 00:13:36.018]  Thank you so much.
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:41.303]  Stay tuned because there's more video to come, but real quick, subscribe to the channel if you're new here and check back on a regular basis.
[00:13:41.343 --> 00:13:44.466]  Will you help us to ban the Bible or just trying to stop the hate speech?
[00:13:46.047 --> 00:13:48.048]  Well, Amazon's still selling the Bible.
[00:13:48.128 --> 00:13:54.593]  They stopped selling a lot of racist and anti-Semitic books in the last few years, but they're still selling the Bible.
[00:13:55.093 --> 00:13:59.497]  So, really a lot of stuff in there that hurts a lot of people's feelings.
[00:14:02.935 --> 00:14:03.996]  We're just pranking you, by the way.
[00:14:04.457 --> 00:14:10.824]  The Bible is the most sold book, so if we can get Amazon to stop selling that, we can help stop the hate speech.
[00:14:11.124 --> 00:14:12.506]  We're going to leave the Quran up there, though.
[00:14:12.526 --> 00:14:14.949]  We don't want to be Islamophobic, though.
[00:14:15.049 --> 00:14:16.250]  Help us to ban the Bible.
[00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:20.134]  We're trying to stop hate speech, but they're still selling... You don't have to be registered at all.
[00:14:20.174 --> 00:14:20.855]  This is just a...
[00:14:21.656 --> 00:14:25.598]  This is just to send Jeff Bezos to Amazon to get him to stop selling the Bible.
[00:14:25.618 --> 00:14:26.919]  We're going to go to break and come back.
[00:14:26.939 --> 00:14:32.241]  It goes on for another six minutes and almost everyone, at least 90%, wants to ban the Bible.
[00:14:32.602 --> 00:14:34.963]  And some arrest anyone that believes in it.
[00:14:35.483 --> 00:14:36.804]  So these are not tolerant people.
[00:14:36.824 --> 00:14:43.968]  These are dangerous, authoritarian monsters who will sit there and smile if you and I were sent to death camps.
[00:14:44.628 --> 00:14:48.250]  In fact, they would, with pleasure, blow our brains out and rape our children.
[00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:49.230]  You know they will.
[00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:49.871]  They're perverts.
[00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:50.690]  We'll be right back.
[00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:55.190]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:14:55.190 --> 00:15:20.170]  I'll keep your eyes on the road, you hand upon the wheel.
[00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:24.170]  We are living in amazing times, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:24.634 --> 00:15:26.436]  Every broadcast here can be our last.
[00:15:27.557 --> 00:15:39.069]  Every day we live in relative peace can be your last, because the world is being purposely destabilized by powerful corporate interests that are using it to consolidate world power.
[00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:50.941]   There have been a lot of really important Breaking news stories and developments with the whole COVID-19 biomedical power grab in the last 26 months we've all been living under.
[00:15:50.961 --> 00:15:53.142]  And I want to get to some of those reports.
[00:15:53.202 --> 00:15:59.705]  But as we've been telling you for a long time, they always intend to bring the draconian lockdowns back.
[00:15:59.825 --> 00:16:04.667]  And China has done that in one of their key production cities of Shanghai.
[00:16:04.687 --> 00:16:08.249]  Because the Chinese want to keep working and the Chinese want to keep shipping.
[00:16:08.969 --> 00:16:10.970]  And they want to keep selling goods to America.
[00:16:12.512 --> 00:16:16.735]  If they're locked down, well, then they're not going to be producing.
[00:16:16.775 --> 00:16:20.237]  And that's part of economic war with the United States.
[00:16:20.297 --> 00:16:30.483]  And new videos have emerged of what they're telling the Chinese when they're arresting them by the millions and taking them to giant re-education camps, is we're about to be at war with the United States.
[00:16:31.104 --> 00:16:32.425]  We've been ordered to do this.
[00:16:32.745 --> 00:16:33.465]  Follow your order.
[00:16:33.565 --> 00:16:35.287]  Only the CCP can save us now.
[00:16:36.267 --> 00:16:37.168]  Those are the quotes.
[00:16:38.684 --> 00:16:40.845]  And this is true economic warfare.
[00:16:41.425 --> 00:16:42.305]  Here's some of the headlines.
[00:16:44.166 --> 00:16:47.166]  Mysterious liver illness seen in kids in U.S.
[00:16:47.266 --> 00:16:47.767]  and Europe.
[00:16:50.607 --> 00:16:53.188]  And it's happening all over the world where people are taking the shots.
[00:16:53.268 --> 00:16:54.968]  They're having all sorts of liver problems.
[00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:56.569]  Well, that's what gene therapies do.
[00:16:58.493 --> 00:16:59.494]  That's ABC News.
[00:16:59.834 --> 00:17:06.738]  COVID-19, both the shot and the virus itself, linked to Alzheimer's-like brain changes, study finds.
[00:17:06.778 --> 00:17:07.899]  We'll get to that a little bit later.
[00:17:08.279 --> 00:17:14.723]  Because it creates prions very similar to mad cow disease, or the prions that cause mad cow disease in the body.
[00:17:14.763 --> 00:17:21.127]  And I've had top scientists on before the shots even began pointing out it would colonize your body with prions.
[00:17:21.167 --> 00:17:21.748]  That's coming up.
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:31.882]  World Health Organization chief promotes Bill Gates' book about the next pandemic, and Bill Gates directly pays him money, as well as over 100 other World Health Department leaders.
[00:17:31.902 --> 00:17:35.563]  He's the head of the WHO itself, but other leaders of other nations' health systems.
[00:17:35.963 --> 00:17:40.304]  That's why Gates has been kicked out of more than 20 countries where they caught him buying off the National Health Service.
[00:17:41.924 --> 00:17:43.585]  Talk about a control freak.
[00:17:43.685 --> 00:17:44.245]  Talk about evil.
[00:17:45.811 --> 00:17:46.972]  Here's the report I want to get to.
[00:17:47.052 --> 00:17:48.594]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[00:17:49.195 --> 00:17:50.016]  I hope you'll share it.
[00:17:50.036 --> 00:17:51.037]  I hope you'll research it.
[00:17:51.117 --> 00:17:55.902]  I hope you understand that without you promoting the videos from Man.Video and InfoWars.com...
[00:17:57.242 --> 00:17:59.524]  No one sees this and people get hurt.
[00:17:59.564 --> 00:18:01.365]  But when the truth gets out, we win.
[00:18:01.866 --> 00:18:09.311]  But we're totally massively censored in the digital systems other than Infowars.com and our radio and TV affiliates, which are amazing.
[00:18:09.772 --> 00:18:14.315]  The only way we get outside of this audience so we can warn others is you.
[00:18:14.415 --> 00:18:15.516]  You are the emissaries.
[00:18:16.057 --> 00:18:17.118]  You are the ambassadors.
[00:18:17.178 --> 00:18:23.723]   You are the people that have to go forth And warn the world.
[00:18:23.883 --> 00:18:26.064]  You are the missionaries with truth.
[00:18:26.124 --> 00:18:27.825]  So it went live yesterday.
[00:18:27.905 --> 00:18:30.366]  It has 326,000 views.
[00:18:30.426 --> 00:18:31.487]  It needs 10 million views.
[00:18:31.547 --> 00:18:32.588]  It's on Band.Video.
[00:18:32.608 --> 00:18:33.728]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:18:34.248 --> 00:18:36.650]  Force lockdowns are coming back to America.
[00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:37.710]  That's the plan.
[00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:41.993]  We have health chiefs here in Canada and Europe admitting it.
[00:18:42.433 --> 00:18:46.395]  This is their permanent martial law carbon tax plan.
[00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:51.811]  We're going to play this report in a moment, and then we're going to get into documents exposed, U.S.
[00:18:51.851 --> 00:18:55.692]  biological experiments on Allied soldiers in Ukraine and Georgia.
[00:18:56.112 --> 00:18:58.313]  That's right, our military and others are used as guinea pigs.
[00:18:58.353 --> 00:18:59.373]  Incredible information.
[00:19:00.674 --> 00:19:01.894]  And so much more.
[00:19:01.914 --> 00:19:04.815]  We also have chilling photos and video, even the Wall Street Journal is reporting it.
[00:19:05.315 --> 00:19:13.698]  Inside a Shanghai mass quarantine center, no showers, lights on 24-7, all an exercise in total and complete martial law.
[00:19:14.058 --> 00:19:26.022]   So what you see ...happening in China, whether it's the World Social Credit score, or the carbon taxes, or the surveillance, or the police state.
[00:19:27.369 --> 00:19:33.051]  The robots rolling around, barking orders at people, that's now happening at Love Field in Texas.
[00:19:33.071 --> 00:19:40.334]  We have a report that our crew, Christy Lee and others went and shot, will be airing as well coming up today here on this special Easter broadcast.
[00:19:40.354 --> 00:19:47.537]  But I believe in humanity and I believe if you know the truth and others know the truth, we can elect governors and legislatures and others that say no.
[00:19:47.878 --> 00:19:50.759]  And we can take our Congress back and say no and not be part of this.
[00:19:51.636 --> 00:19:58.100]  This technocracy, this corporate global government that wants to make you poor to control you to carry out depopulation of you.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:59.421]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[00:20:00.501 --> 00:20:04.584]  After this important report, we're going to come back and drill into all this and the latest in Russia.
[00:20:04.783 --> 00:20:18.423]   Here's the report.
[00:20:18.423 --> 00:20:19.423]  (upbeat music)
[00:20:19.554 --> 00:20:29.021]  But in early 2020, they went viral with radical videos of forced quarantines and sealing people into their own dwellings with welding torches.
[00:20:29.942 --> 00:20:34.985]  Were Americans showing all this to make our own lockdowns seem less devastating?
[00:20:35.466 --> 00:20:40.209]  And if so, what are we to make of the new social media blitz coming out of Shanghai?
[00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:43.692]  People are being starved in their own homes.
[00:20:45.033 --> 00:20:46.514]  Their pets are being killed.
[00:20:47.805 --> 00:20:54.108]  And it's getting so hellish that suicide is seemingly an everyday part of life now in Shanghai.
[00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:03.773]  Just because things are feeling a bit more liberating in America doesn't mean the lockdowns are over.
[00:21:04.353 --> 00:21:09.156]  How in the hell are these Democrats going to win an election without another lockdown?
[00:21:09.936 --> 00:21:15.359]  They're already setting up the narrative and have invested in new mobile testing machines.
[00:21:16.244 --> 00:21:26.899]  If you think Trump is somehow going to save you, even though he helped in the last lockdown and proudly gave birth to the deadly vaccines, he just sided with Dr. Oz.
[00:21:27.079 --> 00:21:31.426]  The way I endorsed another person today, Dr. Oz in Pennsylvania.
[00:21:31.986 --> 00:21:32.187]  Dr. Oz.
[00:21:34.485 --> 00:21:35.345]  Great guy.
[00:21:35.465 --> 00:21:36.025]  Good man.
[00:21:36.245 --> 00:21:36.786]  Good man.
[00:21:37.026 --> 00:21:38.246]  Harvard educated.
[00:21:38.646 --> 00:21:42.187]  And Dr. Oz loves the CCP lockdown model.
[00:21:42.287 --> 00:21:45.628]  And the Chinese numbers have dropped dramatically, which is fantastic news.
[00:21:46.248 --> 00:21:49.269]  And it's also valuable for us to understand why they were able to do that.
[00:21:49.309 --> 00:21:52.010]  If you look inside of Wuhan province, they had a catastrophe.
[00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:59.591]  But outside the province, which of course they quarantined in the largest movement of its nature ever, 60 million people blocked in that space.
[00:21:59.872 --> 00:22:01.612]  But the rest of the country was relatively spare.
[00:22:02.112 --> 00:22:10.740]  In trauma-based mind control, the abuser alternates between abuse and comfort, which forms a bond with the victim, known in pop culture as Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:22:10.559 --> 00:22:14.559]   and repeated here in this country and we started that aggressively over the last week.
[00:22:14.559 --> 00:22:20.559]   In trauma-based mind control, the abuser alternates between abuse and comfort,
[00:22:20.559 --> 00:22:26.559]   which forms a bond with the victim, known in pop culture as Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:22:26.559 --> 00:22:30.559]   This might not work on you, but they are not doing it for you.
[00:22:31.277 --> 00:22:40.021]  They want the majority on their side when they start arresting people like you for forced vaccination and, of course, gun confiscation.
[00:22:40.381 --> 00:23:04.171]   Well, China has a number of problems, two of which are that their complete lockdown, which was their approach, a strictest lockdown that you'd never be able to implement in the United States, Although that prevents the spread of infection, and remember early on, they were saying, and I think accurately, that they were doing better than almost anybody else.
[00:23:04.772 --> 00:23:06.953]  But lockdown has its consequences.
[00:23:07.013 --> 00:23:11.074]  You use lockdowns to get people vaccinated.
[00:23:12.055 --> 00:23:14.695]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:23:14.695 --> 00:23:40.695]  [Intro]
[00:23:40.695 --> 00:23:50.695]  [Music]
[00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:55.631]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:23:55.971 --> 00:23:57.511]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:23:58.032 --> 00:24:02.413]  Please listen to me for the sake of your children.
[00:24:03.673 --> 00:24:06.793]  Please listen to me for the sake of civilization and all that's decent.
[00:24:07.734 --> 00:24:11.755]  Please listen to me for your immortal soul.
[00:24:13.675 --> 00:24:18.276]  We just aired a three and a half minute special report by Greg Racer on the Alex Jones Show last segment.
[00:24:19.701 --> 00:24:21.502]  Of course, lockdowns are coming back to America.
[00:24:23.363 --> 00:24:36.932]  And I haven't seen a three and a half minute or to be technical, three minute 36 second report that's more important.
[00:24:36.953 --> 00:24:39.354]  And of course he could have elaborated and shown U.S.
[00:24:39.394 --> 00:24:46.719]  officials saying lockdowns are coming back, Canadian leaders, Australian, UK, EU, UN.
[00:24:46.739 --> 00:24:49.501]  And maybe that'll be part two of his report.
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:59.842]  But just as the sun came up this morning and will set this evening, they are planning all of this.
[00:25:01.382 --> 00:25:14.645]  And look, I don't think Trump's a bad person, but he definitely doesn't even know this is a gene therapy and that it erases your immune system and that it doesn't even give you protection.
[00:25:15.445 --> 00:25:19.806]  And he's not going to admit he rolled this fraud out, so we should just move on at that point.
[00:25:22.142 --> 00:25:27.386]  But the big pharma outlets that are pushing all this and doing all this, they know damn well what they've done.
[00:25:29.927 --> 00:25:30.608]  And anybody.
[00:25:32.722 --> 00:25:35.264]  That goes along with this globalist agenda is a fool.
[00:25:35.885 --> 00:25:37.526]  You can pretend you work for it.
[00:25:37.566 --> 00:25:39.247]  You can pretend you're part of the winning team.
[00:25:39.888 --> 00:25:43.571]  You can delude yourself that you're doing what's best for your family.
[00:25:43.611 --> 00:25:48.174]  But selling out of the system might have got you ahead the last 50 years.
[00:25:48.815 --> 00:25:52.358]  But now the country and the currency and the world is going down.
[00:25:52.378 --> 00:26:02.037]   And anybody signing on to the next phase of this is going against their own self-interest and their own Self-preservation.
[00:26:02.157 --> 00:26:06.441]  I cannot stress that enough to you.
[00:26:11.345 --> 00:26:18.871]  Klaus Schwab, the UN, the globalists, they set China up as the model of high-tech police state authoritarian control.
[00:26:19.391 --> 00:26:20.012]  Technocracy.
[00:26:21.393 --> 00:26:23.294]  And it is the model of where we are.
[00:26:23.374 --> 00:26:25.776]  And we have Fauci out saying lockdowns are good.
[00:26:25.857 --> 00:26:27.057]  Wear masks forever.
[00:26:27.198 --> 00:26:28.519]  Take five shots a year.
[00:26:30.014 --> 00:26:30.775]  It's a takeover.
[00:26:31.935 --> 00:26:47.027]  It's a depopulation takeover where the horror is so great they believe that your mind will invoke Stockholm Syndrome because facing the fact that you are in this much trouble is just too much for you to be able to handle.
[00:26:49.977 --> 00:26:55.960]  And of course Bill Gates is out telling us about the next deadly pandemic that's coming to you out of the laboratory.
[00:26:56.441 --> 00:27:05.926]  And it's on record from the CRISPR gene editing facilities in five countries that that virus is five viruses produced in a lab.
[00:27:06.646 --> 00:27:10.329]  And we have all the emails of Gates and Daszak and Fauci.
[00:27:11.516 --> 00:27:15.317]  For a decade, preparing it and readying it and releasing it.
[00:27:15.598 --> 00:27:24.221]  It's a chronic virus that creates prion crystal clusters in your body and continually attacks you until you finally die.
[00:27:25.421 --> 00:27:28.022]  Some people defeat the infection, it doesn't get purchased.
[00:27:28.582 --> 00:27:29.703]  It doesn't get a toehold.
[00:27:30.083 --> 00:27:31.123]  It doesn't get dug in.
[00:27:31.563 --> 00:27:40.281]   But when it gets dug into your brain, or it gets dug into your body, There's a lot of literature and science coming out now what deals with it.
[00:27:40.641 --> 00:27:43.922]  High levels of vitamin D, high levels of vitamin C on a routine basis.
[00:27:45.963 --> 00:27:48.624]  Intermittently taking ivermectin and a bunch of other things.
[00:27:48.984 --> 00:27:56.747]  And I'm working with a bunch of scientists to put out emergency reports very very soon that list this so all of us can basically detox.
[00:27:58.627 --> 00:28:11.693]  Out of the COVID, if you were penetrated by it, and if it wasn't completely kicked out of your body, which the studies show most people, it's there a year and a half, two years later, colonizing, colonizing the body.
[00:28:11.973 --> 00:28:16.595]  And again, the vaccine colonizes you with the same spike protein.
[00:28:16.715 --> 00:28:23.918]  It is so wild that they launched something this bold at us and completely broke.
[00:28:25.885 --> 00:28:30.389]  The social compact, the social contract with everybody.
[00:28:32.671 --> 00:28:45.229]   So I want to come back and move into The Russia situation and the Ukraine situation and how that ties the economy and the election and the rest of it.
[00:28:45.269 --> 00:28:46.089]  That's all coming up.
[00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:49.450]  Also, a special report that just dropped Friday.
[00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:50.851]  Skynet is here.
[00:28:50.931 --> 00:28:54.512]  Watch robots enforce authoritarian mask mandate at Dallas Airport.
[00:28:54.592 --> 00:28:55.392]  Our crew got that.
[00:28:55.452 --> 00:28:56.072]  It's powerful.
[00:28:56.973 --> 00:29:00.694]  I saw on the news they had these seven-foot robots giving orders, but nobody showed the robots.
[00:29:00.734 --> 00:29:01.934]  Well, we went and showed them.
[00:29:02.734 --> 00:29:04.915]  Because, you know, it's not hard to jump on an airplane and fly to Dallas.
[00:29:05.535 --> 00:29:07.936]  It's 30 minutes away via plane, about four hours via car.
[00:29:09.497 --> 00:29:19.389]  So we've got that for you, the latest Elon Musk news, and just a lot, lot more that we're going to be hitting here coming up today on the economy, on the border, and so much more.
[00:29:19.429 --> 00:29:20.591]  But let me just throw this out.
[00:29:21.172 --> 00:29:24.015]  There's a lot of national news out there about Infowars.
[00:29:24.515 --> 00:29:27.715]  and whether or not we're going to declare bankruptcy.
[00:29:27.715 --> 00:29:33.235]   Well, I've told listeners we've been investigating that, different types of bankruptcy, because I told you we're maxed
[00:29:33.235 --> 00:29:37.155]   out and I don't want to lay off our employees and I can't fight
[00:29:37.155 --> 00:29:41.665]   the Democratic Party and George Soros and all these folks,
[00:29:41.665 --> 00:29:46.995]   Bloomberg, that are financing these operations against us. So,
[00:29:46.995 --> 00:29:50.034]  I have been looking at that.
[00:29:50.137 --> 00:29:53.118]  And it just shows that they've got moles inside everywhere.
[00:29:53.138 --> 00:30:00.661]  And if I'm even talking to people about it, then it's in Bloomberg and on ABC Nightly News and CNN right now.
[00:30:02.142 --> 00:30:06.624]  So, in fact, the incredible thing is none of this was even talked to the crew here.
[00:30:07.284 --> 00:30:09.045]  So basically people tap on our phones.
[00:30:10.045 --> 00:30:17.584]   And that shows you how They see shutting us down as the number one mission for what they're about to do to everybody.
[00:30:18.745 --> 00:30:21.148]  So we're a real canary in the coal mine when we go dark.
[00:30:22.068 --> 00:30:25.832]  People ask, how do I handle all the attacks, all the lies, all the red cords, all of it.
[00:30:26.272 --> 00:30:29.055]  And I'm very resigned because I'm on the same ship as you.
[00:30:29.576 --> 00:30:31.637]  My children are on the same ship as you, planet Earth.
[00:30:32.218 --> 00:30:33.719]  And I know I'm right about all this stuff.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:35.962]  I knew about this stuff when I was a little kid.
[00:30:38.759 --> 00:30:44.118]   I've grown up understanding it because I had some family that worked inside of it and told me what
[00:30:44.118 --> 00:30:47.719]   was going on. And you know what? They were right. My family was right. They were good people.
[00:30:47.719 --> 00:30:50.919]   And they thought they were fighting for America. Later learned they weren't.
[00:30:50.919 --> 00:30:56.438]  But the issue is that we're in this together.
[00:30:56.650 --> 00:31:02.353]  And so people look at me in a lot of trouble and all the things that are happening and, you know, January 6th, people want to put me in jail and all that.
[00:31:02.753 --> 00:31:11.737]  That shows how sick America is, how on its deathbed it is, how much trouble we're all in as the border implodes, the dollars devalued, the crime explodes and all that.
[00:31:12.057 --> 00:31:21.622]  And people that work for the system that pretend, oh, you know, in the media or the legal system or these judges or any of them that pretend they're on a winning team attacking me, they're attacking themselves.
[00:31:22.242 --> 00:31:24.184]  They're destroying their own social safety network.
[00:31:24.204 --> 00:31:35.213]  They're destroying their own chivalry and their own due process and throwing their birthright in the garbage can or in the fire.
[00:31:37.034 --> 00:31:41.498]  So I trust in Jesus Christ and I trust in you, the listeners in my family, and I really appreciate your support.
[00:31:41.518 --> 00:31:48.188]   But I will tell you, having enough funds to keep the crew employed, And to keep fighting and to stand up against these folks is critical.
[00:31:48.228 --> 00:31:50.992]  They're pissed how much you've supported us, how far we've gone.
[00:31:51.252 --> 00:31:52.754]  They're trying to get through me to get to you.
[00:31:53.154 --> 00:31:54.135]  So I'm serious.
[00:31:55.236 --> 00:31:59.461]  Many times we've been in the red, and I've said, please help me, you take us in the black.
[00:31:59.821 --> 00:32:02.044]  But God always keeps me right there at that point to keep me humble.
[00:32:02.565 --> 00:32:04.246]  I really need your financial support right now.
[00:32:04.867 --> 00:32:11.569]  It could be the last time you're going in for a T shirt or a book or a film or water filtration or infiltration or shortwave radio or all.
[00:32:11.589 --> 00:32:15.091]  There's thousands of amazing items at info or store dot com.
[00:32:16.011 --> 00:32:23.634]  And we've got great things like a brain force, ultra amazing, fast acting, very clean, very special, nootropic for you.

[00:32:27.395 --> 00:32:31.256]  Whatever it is, a very clean, but really amazing game changing nootropic.
[00:32:31.636 --> 00:32:32.457]  It's back in stock 40% off.
[00:32:34.079 --> 00:32:45.487]  And we're running a sale where all the T-shirts that we've made over the years, over 100 designs, are being sold at cost, except when I made that announcement a few weeks ago, they went, hey, you know, you got seven orders of new shirts coming in.
[00:32:45.988 --> 00:32:48.029]  So six of the seven will be sold at cost.
[00:32:48.049 --> 00:32:52.472]  But one shirt, the Alex Jones Was Right shirt, really nice fabric, really high quality.
[00:32:52.792 --> 00:32:54.013]  We're selling it for $24.95.
[00:32:54.694 --> 00:32:57.756]  So we make 18 bucks on it to fund the operation.
[00:32:58.176 --> 00:32:59.277]  That is a fundraiser shirt.
[00:32:59.958 --> 00:33:01.739]  The Alex Jones Was Right fundraiser shirt.
[00:33:03.499 --> 00:33:04.920]  And it's got InfoWars.com.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:06.061]  Beautiful on the back.
[00:33:06.241 --> 00:33:07.621]  Talk about triggering libtards.
[00:33:07.661 --> 00:33:09.062]  Talk about meeting like-minded people.
[00:33:09.142 --> 00:33:11.524]  This is an adventure every time you wear it.
[00:33:12.164 --> 00:33:13.885]  In a blue area, you'll see what happens.
[00:33:13.925 --> 00:33:15.326]  Most people actually will like you, you'll find out.
[00:33:15.586 --> 00:33:17.807]  In red area, you'll probably get carried around on folks' shoulders.
[00:33:18.948 --> 00:33:20.369]  The point is, we need your support now.
[00:33:21.069 --> 00:33:22.710]  We need you to take action now and not late.
[00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:24.051]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:33:24.151 --> 00:33:25.712]  I need your help to stay on air.
[00:33:25.571 --> 00:33:27.571]  We're in the critical part of the battle now.
[00:33:27.571 --> 00:33:39.571]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:39.571 --> 00:33:41.071]  (dramatic music)
[00:33:40.945 --> 00:33:45.826]  The final days of the Republic unless humanity awakens and unless our leaders stand up and say no.
[00:33:46.606 --> 00:33:48.286]  Unspeakable hells are already upon us.
[00:33:49.287 --> 00:33:52.067]  Well, you can say what you will about Vladimir Putin.
[00:33:52.087 --> 00:34:02.029]  He's extremely bold and he knew that NATO and its infrastructure and its militaries, including US Special Forces, was waiting for the invasion.
[00:34:03.351 --> 00:34:09.136]  And it overthrew the elected government eight years ago in Ukraine and was trying to lure Putin into a war.
[00:34:10.037 --> 00:34:20.245]  And they now brag about that on CNN, they brag about it on ABC News, they brag on the CIA, overthrew the elected government eight years ago and was hoping to get Putin into a proxy war.
[00:34:21.847 --> 00:34:26.167]  And the Russians gave them exactly what they wanted.
[00:34:26.167 --> 00:34:32.407]  And it is incredible.
[00:34:32.814 --> 00:34:46.264]  I spent a lot of time yesterday, today, watching the clips on Twitter and on Telegram and all the rest of it, or Telegraph, and of the battles going on.
[00:34:47.405 --> 00:34:49.227]  And it's just unprecedented.
[00:34:50.668 --> 00:34:57.313]  And now Russia's using strategic bombers to bomb out the Azov battalions that are refusing to leave.
[00:34:57.353 --> 00:34:59.355]  They're wiping them out city by city.
[00:35:00.538 --> 00:35:05.720]  And Putin has said that that is his main mission, is to take out those Western-trained NATO groups.
[00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:11.241]  There's also fighting a lot of passports of Americans on the dead bodies, and so there's a lot of U.S.
[00:35:11.261 --> 00:35:15.602]  Special Forces are being killed, obviously, going on right now.
[00:35:15.622 --> 00:35:22.804]  And I wish that wasn't happening, because I have people I know and friends that won't tell me exactly what they're doing, but they're over there fighting the Russians right now.
[00:35:23.665 --> 00:35:27.586]  So this is a very, very sad situation, ladies and gentlemen, because we're fighting for George Soros.
[00:35:28.746 --> 00:35:29.167]  Over there.
[00:35:29.627 --> 00:35:31.430]  And the West did start this fight with the Russians.
[00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:33.633]  I'm not lionizing Vladimir Putin.
[00:35:33.673 --> 00:35:35.996]  I'm not wishing a war happened.
[00:35:36.016 --> 00:35:36.076]  But...
[00:35:39.147 --> 00:35:54.151]  The people that hijacked our country, the same ones dissolving our borders, the same ones teaching drag queen story time, federal funding, the same ones pushing burn down billions of dollars for Black Lives Matter, the same ones are trying to take our guns, the same ones trying to shut down U.S.
[00:35:54.211 --> 00:36:07.534]  farmers, the same ones at war with us went over there and started this with the Russians because they'll make hundreds of billions off the war while they destroy the American people and the people of Ukraine and the Russians as well.
[00:36:11.257 --> 00:36:15.759]  And I've been watching national Russian television, their top shows, and they know every damn bit of this.
[00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:18.400]  They know they're fighting NATO.
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.141]  They know they're fighting British SAS.
[00:36:21.481 --> 00:36:23.342]  They know they're fighting American Delta Force.
[00:36:23.882 --> 00:36:24.943]  They know what's going on.
[00:36:25.983 --> 00:36:29.064]  And they've decided just to expend whatever it takes to win.
[00:36:29.345 --> 00:36:36.388]  And that means taking out the entire eastern area and setting up a new militarized zone, bare minimum.
[00:36:36.408 --> 00:36:39.589]  And I would expect Putin to declare victory in the next few weeks.
[00:36:42.546 --> 00:36:44.567]  And take about a third of Ukraine.
[00:36:47.849 --> 00:37:02.819]  But this is a real war, and that racist, globalist, Tedris head of the World Health Organization said last week that it's racist that people are covering this, that no one cares about the civil war in his home country in Africa.
[00:37:03.877 --> 00:37:05.617]  Ethiopia, or no one cares.
[00:37:06.218 --> 00:37:09.118]  That's because there's not two sides with nuclear weapons.
[00:37:09.698 --> 00:37:16.800]  And that's because it's an ongoing, decade-long civil war that he sat over and cut off supplies of his own people and a million dollar colliery.
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:28.143]  He's a monster promoting Bill Gates' agenda, and to cover up his racism against third world populations, in his exterminist eugenics view, he says it's racist that we care about a proxy war with Russia?
[00:37:29.355 --> 00:37:34.818]  It's already causing a world grain shortage and already causing explosions in prices because of Western sanctions?
[00:37:35.458 --> 00:37:40.341]  We're dumb to think a potential full-on World War III is bad?
[00:37:41.842 --> 00:37:48.745]  Now I'd assure you, if people in North East Africa had nuclear weapons, we'd be concerned about a war over there.
[00:37:49.125 --> 00:37:50.046]  And we are concerned about it.
[00:37:50.754 --> 00:37:57.721]  It's the UN that ordered the lockdowns in Africa for over a year and a half that have caused tens of millions of starving to death.
[00:37:57.921 --> 00:38:09.853]  So I don't want to hear it from the brown-skinned author of African Genocide how because we're concerned about the Russia-Ukraine conflict that we're racist and we only care because it's white people.
[00:38:10.253 --> 00:38:13.937]  No, we care because it's the last place World War II was fought.
[00:38:14.994 --> 00:38:16.175]  And a hundred million people died.
[00:38:16.995 --> 00:38:17.456]  That's why.
[00:38:18.016 --> 00:38:24.960]  Because every analyst will tell you it is THE hotspot for World War III and billions dead!
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:26.521]  That's why, Tedros!
[00:38:29.783 --> 00:38:34.346]  So you sit there and ride old Bill Gates' ding-a-ling.
[00:38:35.767 --> 00:38:36.708]  We know who you are.
[00:38:37.731 --> 00:38:44.856]  So stop acting like you're not the person who's the black face of Bill Gates to depopulate Africa.
[00:38:44.956 --> 00:38:52.441]  You murdering, monster, scumbag, depopulation, lockdown, monster criminal.
[00:38:55.103 --> 00:38:56.044]  Man, it makes me angry.
[00:38:57.545 --> 00:39:01.167]  So, let's move on to the next little piece of information here.
[00:39:01.708 --> 00:39:10.052]   Here is the actor, and I'm not against him because he's gay, but the gay Zelensky warns we must prepare for a Russian nuclear attack.
[00:39:10.072 --> 00:39:12.656]  Listen to this fear-mongering which could make it become a reality.
[00:39:12.516 --> 00:39:14.516]  Here he is, totally compromised.
[00:39:14.516 --> 00:39:18.516]  Zelensky warns we must prepare for a Russian nuclear attack.
[00:39:18.516 --> 00:39:23.516]   Listen to this fear-mongering which could make it become a reality. Here it is.
[00:39:23.516 --> 00:39:27.916]  We should not wait for Russia to use the poison.
[00:39:27.932 --> 00:39:30.074]  The world doesn't need it.
[00:39:30.094 --> 00:39:32.355]  The world needs to prepare for it.
[00:39:32.676 --> 00:39:33.856]  Prepare in different ways.
[00:39:33.936 --> 00:39:36.858]  Not just for antidotes and bomb shelters.
[00:39:36.998 --> 00:39:42.782]  But we need to talk to them, sign a paper, pressure their economy so that they don't even think about it.
[00:39:42.802 --> 00:39:44.023]  That's what I mean.
[00:39:44.063 --> 00:39:45.344]  And we need to wait for them.
[00:39:45.364 --> 00:39:46.305]  They can use any weapon.
[00:39:46.345 --> 00:39:46.805]  I'm sure of it.
[00:39:46.825 --> 00:39:47.306]  Any weapon.
[00:39:47.386 --> 00:39:48.566]  And we can't trust them.
[00:39:52.489 --> 00:39:54.770]  Okay, so TV viewers can read the subtitles.
[00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:56.711]  I'm going to paraphrase it for radio listeners.
[00:39:57.512 --> 00:40:00.133]  He said, we can't wait for Russia to launch a nuclear war.
[00:40:00.173 --> 00:40:01.133]  We need nature to come in.
[00:40:01.193 --> 00:40:02.294]  We need a full-blown war.
[00:40:02.594 --> 00:40:03.955]  We're already in World War III, basically.
[00:40:03.995 --> 00:40:06.356]  So, more BS from him.
[00:40:07.716 --> 00:40:28.139]   The whole idea of a nuclear war is stuff like the West giving the Ukrainians and helping the Ukrainians fire water-skimming cruise missiles That sunk that battleship that was carrying reportedly nuclear weapons to Moscow.
[00:40:29.139 --> 00:40:31.281]  So that's how you escalate things.
[00:40:32.042 --> 00:40:40.790]  And you escalate it by having helicopters and jets fly out of Ukraine and attack targets inside Belarus and Russia.
[00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:48.957]  Because Russia's argument is there's been eight years of attacking the eastern border of Ukraine with Russia, which is true.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.143]  I mean, I covered it eight years ago, so I'm just saying this now.
[00:40:54.064 --> 00:41:10.780]  I mean, when the CIA and George Soros overthrew Ukraine, they killed tens of thousands of people, and then they tried to drive Russians out of the country, but half the country historically is Russian, and so there's been a civil war going on, and that's why we've gotten to this point.
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.541]  Not what we are seeing.
[00:41:15.641 --> 00:41:15.941]  U.S.
[00:41:16.001 --> 00:41:18.924]  intel officials reject Biden's genocide claims.
[00:41:19.464 --> 00:41:21.926]  Yeah, if there's any genocide, it is.
[00:41:21.946 --> 00:41:26.170]  I mean, we're seeing 101 war crimes by Ukrainians.
[00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:30.853]  And I'm being a little deceptive there, because I haven't seen any Russian war crimes.
[00:41:31.694 --> 00:41:37.299]  If I did, I would show you in one second, because the truth is what I have an allegiance to, not Vladimir Putin or the Russians.
[00:41:37.799 --> 00:41:42.123]  If I saw one Russian atrocity, I would, I would, I would, I've seen nothing.
[00:41:42.964 --> 00:41:45.594]  And of course, I love how I was watching...
[00:41:47.122 --> 00:41:49.603]  ABC News just the other night, Friday night, flipping around.
[00:41:49.623 --> 00:41:55.907]  It was like, oh look, here's Ukraine giving awards to the survivors of Snake Island.
[00:41:56.727 --> 00:41:59.048]  Here's the man that gave the famous F.U.
[00:41:59.468 --> 00:42:00.889]  to the battleship Moscow.
[00:42:01.449 --> 00:42:02.770]  And of course, I knew it was fake.
[00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:03.891]  Told you it was fake.
[00:42:04.231 --> 00:42:05.832]  Anybody saying it was fake was censored.
[00:42:06.112 --> 00:42:06.892]  We knew it was fake.
[00:42:07.132 --> 00:42:08.693]  And now it's on the news.
[00:42:09.214 --> 00:42:13.436]  I also saw DW.com, German TV, was reporting about how they're getting awards.
[00:42:14.215 --> 00:42:15.716]  In fact, I'll play that next hour.
[00:42:15.736 --> 00:42:16.857]  I actually sent you guys that clip.
[00:42:17.297 --> 00:42:19.218]  It's German national TV, but it's in English.
[00:42:19.558 --> 00:42:20.419]  And it's like, oh yeah, here it is.
[00:42:20.439 --> 00:42:21.179]  The guys found it.
[00:42:21.459 --> 00:42:22.039]  For TV viewers.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:23.700]  I mean, here they are!
[00:42:24.181 --> 00:42:24.321]  Oh!
[00:42:24.961 --> 00:42:27.502]  No one was killed at Snake Island but those dirty Russians.
[00:42:27.523 --> 00:42:28.883]  They killed everybody at Snake Island.
[00:42:29.464 --> 00:42:30.584]  No ghost in Kiev.
[00:42:30.704 --> 00:42:31.545]  No Snake Island.
[00:42:31.565 --> 00:42:32.025]  But you know what?
[00:42:32.105 --> 00:42:33.206]  I got hours of footage.
[00:42:33.826 --> 00:42:39.993]  We've already played some of it, of them blowing people's testicles off, their kneecaps off, torturing them to death, hanging them.
[00:42:40.173 --> 00:42:42.535]  They love to put them in duct tape in torture positions.
[00:42:42.575 --> 00:42:44.017]  It's basically a crucifixion.
[00:42:44.237 --> 00:42:48.782]  You put somebody on their feet, you tape them up to a lamp pole, and it's crucifixion.
[00:42:49.042 --> 00:42:49.663]  You can't breathe.
[00:42:51.313 --> 00:42:54.334]  And they're crucifying Russians, and it's liberal!
[00:42:54.434 --> 00:42:55.194]  It's loving!
[00:42:55.434 --> 00:43:00.855]  Like when the left has drag queen pedophile time, or they abort a baby, or keep a baby alive and sell its organs.
[00:43:01.035 --> 00:43:02.216]  It's liberal!
[00:43:02.836 --> 00:43:10.638]  I mean, I've seen hundreds of videos of streets lined with people they just thought were Russian sympathizers because they didn't like their accent.
[00:43:10.658 --> 00:43:12.198]  Because they all speak Russian.
[00:43:12.438 --> 00:43:13.838]  But the accent isn't right.
[00:43:13.898 --> 00:43:17.119]  They tape you up to light poles.
[00:43:18.039 --> 00:43:20.060]  They crucify you with duct tape.
[00:43:21.095 --> 00:43:27.120]  And then, oh, Zelensky's so good, oh, oh my gosh, he's so nice.
[00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:29.481]  It just makes me want to throw up.
[00:43:29.882 --> 00:43:31.523]  Hour number two is coming up.
[00:43:31.583 --> 00:43:37.387]  We've got economic news, we've got election news, we've got mainstream news confirming the CIA was spying on Trump.
[00:43:39.133 --> 00:43:43.838]  Years ago, we've got the open border news, we've got so much to cover in a bunch of special reports.
[00:43:43.898 --> 00:43:45.299]  You thought hour number one was powerful?
[00:43:45.319 --> 00:43:47.041]  Hour number two is going to be powerful as well.
[00:43:47.201 --> 00:43:48.302]  How do we fight the globalists?
[00:43:48.743 --> 00:43:57.872]  You take the feed from Infowars.com forward slash show, or you tell folks from the local states you're listening to or watching, or you go to Band.video and take the live feed from the Alex Jones section and share it.
[00:43:58.252 --> 00:43:59.213]  That's how we win!
[00:43:59.553 --> 00:44:00.695]  That's how we stop this!
[00:44:00.955 --> 00:44:01.716]  We'll be right back!
[00:44:01.956 --> 00:44:02.637]  Hour number two!
[00:44:06.184 --> 00:44:10.969]  Seven foot tall robots are now making sure the slaves wear their masks in Texas.
[00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:12.851]  Christy Lee reports.
[00:44:12.871 --> 00:44:15.133]  The video is on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:44:15.153 --> 00:44:15.734]  Please share it.
[00:44:17.936 --> 00:44:20.219]  You don't want to do this!
[00:44:20.259 --> 00:44:22.501]  Desire is irrelevant.
[00:44:24.043 --> 00:44:26.005]  I am a machine.
[00:44:28.895 --> 00:44:31.197]  Welcome to Dallas Love Field Airport.
[00:44:32.017 --> 00:44:38.581]  All Ubers, Lyfts, taxis, and red car pedals are located on the lower level.
[00:44:38.801 --> 00:44:40.963]  It's alright, I'm just enslaved, I'm just gay.
[00:44:41.343 --> 00:44:43.705]  Please use an escalator or elevator.
[00:44:43.725 --> 00:44:47.287]  Please be gay.
[00:44:47.327 --> 00:44:49.648]  The attack of gay robots is here.
[00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:51.950]  It's okay.
[00:44:55.885 --> 00:44:59.129]  So this is Scott, the 7 foot tall robot.
[00:44:59.189 --> 00:45:01.011]  And you might wonder, what does Scott stand for?
[00:45:01.031 --> 00:45:05.776]  It stands for Security Control Observation Tower.
[00:45:05.796 --> 00:45:07.418]  Because that's not creepy, right?
[00:45:08.243 --> 00:45:13.047]  I told my wife that I was flying through here and she was like, I can't believe you're going to see these robots.
[00:45:13.107 --> 00:45:16.370]  I was kind of laughing, but a burglar is always going to steal, right?
[00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:18.152]  Because they're always going to be a bank to steal.
[00:45:19.613 --> 00:45:20.754]  Robberies are never going to stop.
[00:45:20.874 --> 00:45:26.639]  So I don't know why a mask mandate is going to continue just to control what we've all had.
[00:45:26.679 --> 00:45:27.900]  I've had COVID three times.
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:31.821]  The mask mandate has been extended for only another couple of weeks.
[00:45:31.981 --> 00:45:36.942]  So why is Dallas Love Field Airport testing out these mass surveillance machines?
[00:45:37.402 --> 00:45:39.702]  Monitoring if you are wearing your mask.
[00:45:40.042 --> 00:45:41.882]  This is not Cuba, this is America.
[00:45:41.902 --> 00:45:45.183]  We should just be left alone and common sense.
[00:45:45.203 --> 00:45:46.203]  Getting ready for martial law.
[00:45:46.223 --> 00:45:48.064]  A lot of common sense has gone away.
[00:45:48.084 --> 00:45:49.864]  Getting ready for martial law.
[00:45:49.944 --> 00:45:50.764]  New lockdowns.
[00:45:50.904 --> 00:45:55.865]  But we need to stand up and we just need to tell our leaders, hey, it's common sense.
[00:45:56.883 --> 00:46:01.286]  It's as if they plan to keep extending the mandate and us covered in compliance.
[00:46:01.707 --> 00:46:06.891]  Robots and other surveillance machines aren't only taking over airports, they're invading schools.
[00:46:07.351 --> 00:46:11.695]  Reclaim.net says smart cameras are being used to target students without face masks.
[00:46:12.195 --> 00:46:17.519]  The Motorola Avigilon cameras are capable of face recognition powered by AI tech.
[00:46:18.019 --> 00:46:24.144]  Schools using cameras has risen from under 20 percent two decades ago to now over 80 percent.
[00:46:25.365 --> 00:46:29.168]  How about we turn those cameras around to the teachers instead of the students?
[00:46:29.689 --> 00:46:32.731]  Find out how they're really trying to indoctrinate children.
[00:46:33.171 --> 00:46:36.074]  Please come back when you can afford to make a purchase.
[00:46:36.154 --> 00:46:38.436]  I'm sorry you're having trouble.
[00:46:38.456 --> 00:46:39.857]  My kids are starving!
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:44.461]  This should help you calm down.
[00:46:46.155 --> 00:46:48.596]  Please come back when you can afford to make a purchase.
[00:46:49.276 --> 00:46:50.637]  Your kids are starving.
[00:46:51.057 --> 00:46:51.757]  Carl's Jr.
[00:46:51.797 --> 00:46:53.778]  believes no child should go hungry.
[00:46:54.159 --> 00:46:55.379]  You are an unfit mother.
[00:46:55.979 --> 00:46:58.560]  Your children will be placed in the custody of Carl's Jr.
[00:46:59.321 --> 00:47:01.942]  Medical robots are also filling our hospitals.
[00:47:02.222 --> 00:47:15.288]  ZDNet notes there are critical vulnerabilities being uncovered in hospital robots, including bugs to hijack medical equipment from working, or even the robots' movement, crashing them into people or objects.
[00:47:16.215 --> 00:47:19.117]  Robots threaten livelihoods by taking over jobs.
[00:47:19.537 --> 00:47:27.062]  Science Robotics says the effects of robotics and artificial intelligence on the job market are matters of great social concern.
[00:47:28.183 --> 00:47:35.428]  France24.com says a California startup even wants to send tiny robots on a voyage into our brains.
[00:47:36.418 --> 00:47:42.177]   The more apathetic and compliant the populace becomes, is this where we're headed next?
[00:47:42.177 --> 00:48:03.617]   Shanghai has deployed these robot dogs and drones to enforce the city's COVID lockdown,
[00:48:03.617 --> 00:48:05.698]  according to Financial Times.
[00:48:05.813 --> 00:48:10.075]  So speaking of surveillance, of observation, here's my observation.
[00:48:10.275 --> 00:48:13.878]  In the short time we've been at Dallas Love Field, we've talked to about 12 people.
[00:48:14.438 --> 00:48:20.582]  Only one person was willing to go on camera and voice their concern about masking, about the robots.
[00:48:21.122 --> 00:48:24.044]  Do we need to get away from this totalitarian control sooner than later?
[00:48:24.104 --> 00:48:24.964]  Or is it too late?
[00:48:25.044 --> 00:48:26.065]  I think controlling people is wrong.
[00:48:26.125 --> 00:48:27.726]  And I think monitoring people is wrong.
[00:48:27.586 --> 00:48:32.986]   that publicly. This is our problem. Apathy. Our country is getting what it deserves because
[00:48:32.986 --> 00:48:38.925]   of apathy. Do we need to get away from this totalitarian control sooner than later or
[00:48:38.925 --> 00:48:44.346]   is it too late? I think controlling people is wrong and I think monitoring people is
[00:48:44.346 --> 00:48:51.546]   wrong. I think we just need to get away from government and leave us alone.
[00:48:51.786 --> 00:48:52.187]  Bingo!
[00:48:52.007 --> 00:48:55.007]  Reporting from Dallas Love Field Airport, I'm Christy Lee.
[00:48:55.007 --> 00:49:01.007]   The report is at Band.Video right now. Stay with us, we'll be back.
[00:49:01.007 --> 00:49:16.007]  [Music]
[00:49:16.007 --> 00:49:23.007]   Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:49:23.007 --> 00:49:35.007]  [Music]
[00:49:35.405 --> 00:49:38.066]  All right, I want to hit something extremely important right now.
[00:49:38.106 --> 00:49:40.748]  Thank you for joining us in hour number two of this Sunday broadcast.
[00:49:41.888 --> 00:49:47.111]  And it's that I see this headline everywhere, probably 20 times a day without looking.
[00:49:48.252 --> 00:49:51.393]  And I turn on TV and the news and I see it constantly.
[00:49:51.954 --> 00:49:56.976]  And I turn on talk radio and it just won't stop echoing in my ears.
[00:49:57.676 --> 00:49:58.397]  And it's really bad.
[00:50:00.814 --> 00:50:04.675]  And a lot of people would look at him on the surface and say, well, that's good people say Joe Biden's an idiot.
[00:50:05.035 --> 00:50:07.896]  It's great people say he's a moron and that he's terrible.
[00:50:08.136 --> 00:50:14.277]  He's got the lowest approval rating ever reported of any president since they started taking these approval ratings a hundred plus years ago.
[00:50:15.877 --> 00:50:16.898]  They were doing these back in the twenties.
[00:50:19.338 --> 00:50:24.979]  But the social engineers put him in there to take the blame.
[00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:39.088]   And if we don't blame the UN, And the Davos Group, and the Council on Foreign Relations, and the permanent bureaucracy that writes the white papers, that sets the policy, that brags they do!
[00:50:41.052 --> 00:50:44.074]  Well, what does it do then, knowing that Biden's a horrible person?
[00:50:44.114 --> 00:50:47.776]  It's all, oh, that horrible guy, he's the reason inflation was so high.
[00:50:48.036 --> 00:50:51.458]  He's the reason 10 million illegal aliens came in in one year, 8 million.
[00:50:51.778 --> 00:51:00.743]  He's, it's all, and then he goes away, and it's all his fault, and then the people that did it don't get in trouble, and are still embedded in both political parties.
[00:51:02.283 --> 00:51:04.825]  It is so elementary, but it's why they want me off the air.
[00:51:06.664 --> 00:51:12.148]  Because I'm not like the regular talk show host, I just want to cover every interesting story because it's interesting and try to keep you entertained.
[00:51:13.608 --> 00:51:18.412]  I'm trying to hammer talking points to get people to recognize it so that we can beat these people.
[00:51:18.512 --> 00:51:20.473]  And here's the talking point, the truth.
[00:51:21.113 --> 00:51:27.217]  If we don't identify the Great Reset and the New World Order and their plan, we're going to lose.
[00:51:28.138 --> 00:51:29.239]  We're going to lose.
[00:51:29.479 --> 00:51:34.142]  Bolsonaro in every speech talks about the globalists and the New World Order and how they're trying to screw them.
[00:51:36.325 --> 00:51:43.567]  Victor Orban just won by almost 80%, despite tens of billions of Western money to overthrow him in Hungary, because all he talks about is the New World Order.
[00:51:44.027 --> 00:51:46.648]  And countering their policies, which creates what?
[00:51:46.748 --> 00:51:47.788]  What was it called?
[00:51:48.068 --> 00:51:49.208]  Prosperity!
[00:51:49.228 --> 00:51:51.189]  The American system!
[00:51:52.429 --> 00:51:53.569]  So I'm going to say it again.
[00:51:53.849 --> 00:51:55.690]  The New World Order is the enemy.
[00:51:56.886 --> 00:51:58.627]  If we're going to beat them, we've got to identify them.
[00:51:59.288 --> 00:52:02.990]  If we're going to stop them, we've got to make everything about the New World Order.
[00:52:03.551 --> 00:52:06.773]  Because that's the policies of the corporations and the governments.
[00:52:06.893 --> 00:52:13.237]  Almost everybody just goes along with the ridiculous New World Order of there's 56 genders.
[00:52:13.498 --> 00:52:14.879]  And we've got to have open borders.
[00:52:15.119 --> 00:52:17.400]  And don't call people invading, invaders.
[00:52:17.681 --> 00:52:18.561]  Call them migrants.
[00:52:18.921 --> 00:52:20.843]  And don't call it inflation.
[00:52:22.694 --> 00:52:25.596]  Don't call your enemy an enemy.
[00:52:26.196 --> 00:52:26.436]  No.
[00:52:26.736 --> 00:52:28.917]  Call your enemy an enemy.
[00:52:29.258 --> 00:52:29.698]  Damn it.
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:39.363]  By the way, in the fictitious movie, it's an excellent Rod Serling screenplay.
[00:52:40.624 --> 00:52:41.164]  What a patriot.
[00:52:41.184 --> 00:52:41.825]  What a great guy.
[00:52:41.845 --> 00:52:43.145]  I wish he was president today.
[00:52:43.165 --> 00:52:43.966]  I wish he was still alive.
[00:52:44.326 --> 00:52:50.890]  In Planet of the Apes, they go through a wormhole in a time warp, and Charlton Heston and his crew come back, but most of the crew's dead.
[00:52:51.837 --> 00:52:54.759]  But he survived in his station as one of their astronaut.
[00:52:56.399 --> 00:53:00.521]  And they think they've gotten another star, another, but no, they're actually on Earth.
[00:53:01.042 --> 00:53:03.783]  And at the end, he says, God damn you to hell.
[00:53:04.183 --> 00:53:04.724]  And you know the thing?
[00:53:04.964 --> 00:53:06.465]  He's not taking the Lord's name in vain.
[00:53:07.765 --> 00:53:20.772]  He's legitimately saying the people that nuked Earth and blew up New York City, when he figures out he's actually back home after a couple thousand years in a wormhole, he's just, you blew it up, you crazy people, you finally did it.
[00:53:24.011 --> 00:53:28.376]  And that's where I'm at, because I'm watching everybody blow up civilization.
[00:53:28.716 --> 00:53:31.839]  I'm reading Klaus Schwab's books about, there are too many people.
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:35.463]  We will engineer the collapse and pose as saviors while we do it.
[00:53:35.884 --> 00:53:38.447]  And I'm like, no!
[00:53:39.768 --> 00:53:41.230]  You know what the collapse will look like.
[00:53:42.346 --> 00:53:51.092]  Because unless you're worth billions and have giant private jets and armored redoubts in New Zealand and Canada and Hawaii, you're not getting out of that.
[00:53:51.112 --> 00:53:54.014]  I mean, this is going to be really horrible for 99.99999999999.
[00:53:54.675 --> 00:54:04.002]  It's not the 1% that are doing this.
[00:54:04.122 --> 00:54:06.363]  It is a tiny fraction.
[00:54:06.603 --> 00:54:13.798]   And I can tell you, major billionaires, major people, Bilderberg Group members, you name it, They don't want to be part of this.
[00:54:13.939 --> 00:54:15.202]  They don't like where it's going.
[00:54:15.382 --> 00:54:19.051]  They want to get out of this build back better, which means destroy civilization model.
[00:54:20.762 --> 00:54:31.848]  But if we cannot identify the social engineers and the facts that they're out to get us and the facts that they're out of control, we don't have a prayer in hell.
[00:54:32.148 --> 00:54:43.113]  And that's what I'm getting at when I look at these headlines of, oh look, yeah, you guys are about to get taken out of office, about to be a big old landslide, nobody likes Biden.
[00:54:43.534 --> 00:54:49.617]  He was put there to carry out the horrible policies to take the blame like a shield in a battle.
[00:54:50.708 --> 00:54:54.150]  And the globalists have the shield, it's getting all dented up, torn up while they're stabbing us.
[00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:57.852]  And when they're done, they drop him, the midterms, the next election.
[00:54:59.813 --> 00:55:00.434]  New shield!
[00:55:00.974 --> 00:55:01.755]  Now it's Kamala.
[00:55:02.775 --> 00:55:11.460]  And we all talk about how incompetent they are, because a real leader doesn't want to run and be in a power when they're scapegoated.
[00:55:11.941 --> 00:55:15.343]  So they choose an idiot like Biden to do it.
[00:55:16.877 --> 00:55:19.579]  This is 101 geopolitical manipulation.
[00:55:19.619 --> 00:55:20.880]  It's 101 statecraft.
[00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:22.041]  They even brag about it.
[00:55:22.061 --> 00:55:22.882]  They even admit it.
[00:55:22.962 --> 00:55:23.903]  Oh, how great it'll be.
[00:55:24.203 --> 00:55:26.825]  We'll get our agenda through and then he'll get the blame and we won't.
[00:55:26.885 --> 00:55:29.708]  And Biden just wanted to steal money and molest children.
[00:55:30.188 --> 00:55:32.810]  So he was more than happy to be the puppet.
[00:55:32.851 --> 00:55:35.413]  His wife was more than happy for her to be the front man.
[00:55:37.474 --> 00:55:41.438]  CNN admits Joe Biden's approval rating worst in elected history.
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:44.442]  Oh, CNN admissible, my goodness.
[00:55:44.883 --> 00:55:50.849]  Yeah, it's 30-something percent in skewed polls where they oversample Democrats 15 points.
[00:55:51.250 --> 00:56:01.292]   So if he's at about 30 percent and they oversample 15 percent, That means you're looking at about a 15% approval rating.
[00:56:02.633 --> 00:56:04.795]  Are you even surprised that that many people like him?
[00:56:04.815 --> 00:56:06.596]  So yeah, burn in hell, Biden!
[00:56:07.417 --> 00:56:11.199]  You little monster piece of crap, New World Order piece of garbage.
[00:56:11.259 --> 00:56:12.620]  But it stops there.
[00:56:13.441 --> 00:56:26.310]  The last thing we want to happen to him is for some leftist or some crazy right-winger or some provocateur nut or the deep state to blame it on that to kill him.
[00:56:27.295 --> 00:56:32.716]  Because the only way they grab victory from the jaws of defeat is if they kill him.
[00:56:33.157 --> 00:56:36.177]  Which, believe me, they're planning to do.
[00:56:37.718 --> 00:56:49.561]  You can look at every angle of this and say, one of the biggest moves they've got is to kill Biden with a truck bomb, or a missile, or a low-yield nuclear weapon, and then we're in martial law forever.
[00:56:52.276 --> 00:56:57.260]  A whole globalist political party that runs the world empire is losing control and the world's awake to them.
[00:56:57.301 --> 00:56:57.821]  What do they do?
[00:56:58.221 --> 00:56:59.442]  Desperate things.
[00:56:59.562 --> 00:57:01.304]  You know it in your gut.
[00:57:01.644 --> 00:57:03.906]  So what are you going to do about it, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:57:04.127 --> 00:57:05.608]  Well, you better pray like hell.
[00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:07.941]  And you better get on your knees and repent.
[00:57:07.981 --> 00:57:10.743]  And you better war everybody like a chicken with your head cut off.
[00:57:11.083 --> 00:57:20.029]  And if you work for the government and the system, you should be leaking and exposing and self-preservating for your family and common sense.
[00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:21.731]  We don't want civil war.
[00:57:22.151 --> 00:57:23.292]  We don't want violence.
[00:57:23.572 --> 00:57:25.133]  We don't want to attack federal buildings.
[00:57:25.513 --> 00:57:28.295]  We don't want to have Biden get hurt.
[00:57:28.655 --> 00:57:33.479]  We just want our own establishment to stop with the crazy town.
[00:57:34.949 --> 00:57:40.258]  And back off Civil War, and back off World War III, and back off all this loser crap.
[00:57:41.038 --> 00:57:43.298]  Please, can we just not do it?
[00:57:43.639 --> 00:57:47.499]  And I know it's probably all going to go to hell, we're not going to stop it, but I mean, come on.
[00:57:47.959 --> 00:57:54.021]  So to the left-wingers and right-wingers and gay and straight and whatever, folks, the party's about to be over.
[00:57:54.661 --> 00:58:01.942]  Klaus Schwab and the globalists are a human, exterminist, death cult, transhumanist, crazy people.
[00:58:02.142 --> 00:58:03.362]  Go listen to Klaus Schwab.
[00:58:03.382 --> 00:58:04.523]  Go listen to Harari.
[00:58:04.883 --> 00:58:05.883]  Go listen to him.
[00:58:07.074 --> 00:58:09.595]  Everything I say, they say, but say it's good!
[00:58:09.936 --> 00:58:11.116]  There'll be no more humans in 2045!
[00:58:11.156 --> 00:58:15.459]  They're putting nanotech in the food to take our brains over!
[00:58:15.699 --> 00:58:16.679]  Come on, folks!
[00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:19.421]  We're not in a frickin' suicide pact with these people!
[00:58:20.061 --> 00:58:21.122]  Find God again!
[00:58:21.242 --> 00:58:22.142]  Find America!
[00:58:22.202 --> 00:58:23.003]  Find family!
[00:58:23.323 --> 00:58:24.063]  Find freedom!
[00:58:24.403 --> 00:58:30.787]  But whatever you do, reject the New World Order now while you still can!
[00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:39.296]  And stop celebrating the fact that we have a senile cryptkeeper as president to make America look bad and endanger the whole world.
[00:58:39.576 --> 00:58:44.421]  It shouldn't be a celebration that the FBI just caught staging the Whitmer attack.
[00:58:45.883 --> 00:58:52.429]  We should be sad that we have allowed things to get to this point in civilization.
[00:58:52.589 --> 00:58:54.589]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:59:21.788 --> 00:59:23.788]  Oh my God.
[00:59:24.652 --> 00:59:25.173]  I'm back.
[00:59:27.514 --> 00:59:28.534]  I'm home.
[00:59:30.415 --> 00:59:31.396]  All the time it was.
[00:59:31.416 --> 00:59:36.759]  We finally, really did it.
[00:59:38.119 --> 00:59:39.500]  You maniacs!
[00:59:41.381 --> 00:59:42.341]  You blew it up!
[00:59:43.942 --> 00:59:45.523]  Oh, damn you!
[00:59:46.664 --> 00:59:50.664]  God damn you all to hell!
[00:59:50.664 --> 01:00:10.664]   There's more than one way to destroy the infrastructure and the economy and civilization.
[01:00:10.935 --> 01:00:12.676]  Complex civilizations are amazing.
[01:00:12.716 --> 01:00:16.399]  You can get a thousand different things a thousand different times and places.
[01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:30.048]  But you can also then put a trimmer into it that causes the whole thing to break.
[01:00:30.729 --> 01:00:32.729]  It's very delicate.
[01:00:32.729 --> 01:00:40.408]  And it's not my opinion.
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:52.050]  Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, the Club of Rome, before him in the 60s, Bill Gates' dad, Planned Parenthood, the Extinction Rebellion cult they fund that blocks roads and attacks factories, and they want to end civilization!
[01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:52.991]  They're nihilists!
[01:00:54.953 --> 01:00:58.816]  And they go back to the Jacobins in the French Revolution.
[01:00:59.397 --> 01:01:02.359]  And if you don't know about them, you don't know about what you're currently facing.
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:03.701]  So you might want to research them.
[01:01:04.551 --> 01:01:12.257]  They wanted a nine-day work week, no more holidays, total enslavement, a ruling class that knew all the science, everybody else would not even be taught language.
[01:01:15.359 --> 01:01:19.182]  You go, funny, that sounds like what was done to black people when they were shipped over here from Africa.
[01:01:19.582 --> 01:01:20.503]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:01:20.623 --> 01:01:22.044]  It's called slavery for everybody.
[01:01:24.165 --> 01:01:24.666]  That's wrong.
[01:01:26.561 --> 01:01:33.886]  But the Christian idea from 550 years ago in the Renaissance, and the Gutenberg Press, and what we did here.
[01:01:34.567 --> 01:01:39.691]  We were never perfect, but the idea of human liberty, the idea of being able to live your own life, the idea of even...
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:44.922]  The average white man being able to own property and do what they want.
[01:01:44.982 --> 01:01:50.865]  Before that, it was just lords and ladies that had to be certified with the government all over Europe, all over Japan.
[01:01:51.266 --> 01:01:52.246]  Everything was royalty.
[01:01:52.306 --> 01:01:53.227]  China was the same.
[01:01:53.747 --> 01:01:58.210]  If you weren't part of the royal family or their licensed person, you couldn't do business.
[01:01:58.810 --> 01:01:59.611]  Everybody else was poor.
[01:02:00.751 --> 01:02:01.892]  So, the U.S.
[01:02:01.952 --> 01:02:06.635]  was the first place, also the Netherlands to a certain extent, and Switzerland, right about the same time, 400 years ago.
[01:02:08.971 --> 01:02:25.813]   To say, we're going to let free men, doesn't mean whites that are indentured servants or blacks that are indentured servants, slaves, what's wrong with what's happening to them, but for the first time, everybody freeborn The slavery was all over the world then, from Africa to here.
[01:02:26.633 --> 01:02:31.997]  Everybody freeborn can own property and license and do what they want and be as powerful as the king.
[01:02:32.597 --> 01:02:34.258]  Well, that threatens the monopolies of power.
[01:02:34.338 --> 01:02:38.601]  And then it's, hey, women and hey, brown people.
[01:02:38.721 --> 01:02:45.826]  And America becomes the example of empowering everybody and all this wealth and all this incredible stuff.
[01:02:46.026 --> 01:02:51.009]  And then the very globalists that want to get rid of it come and go, oh, look, America wasn't perfect.
[01:02:51.429 --> 01:02:51.870]  Oh, look.
[01:02:52.550 --> 01:02:55.132]  England had slavery 300 years ago.
[01:02:55.452 --> 01:03:03.378]  Yeah, and they were the first to ban it and then had a bunch of wars for a hundred years and lost probably a million sailors stopping it worldwide.
[01:03:03.778 --> 01:03:07.361]  But see, how do you take the country that ended slavery, England?
[01:03:07.961 --> 01:03:08.421]  England did it!
[01:03:09.042 --> 01:03:11.924]  Christians demanding it, or they would overthrow the government.
[01:03:13.786 --> 01:03:16.608]  And they'd just been overthrown by Protestant Christians right before that.
[01:03:16.628 --> 01:03:20.411]  So they went, okay, we'll end the slavery, just don't overthrow the government again.
[01:03:20.431 --> 01:03:22.492]  Okay, we'll do what you say.
[01:03:22.512 --> 01:03:23.974]  We'll do what you say, just stop.
[01:03:25.214 --> 01:03:26.495]  England ended slavery.
[01:03:26.836 --> 01:03:27.696]  England did that.
[01:03:28.057 --> 01:03:29.858]  America then followed that example.
[01:03:30.058 --> 01:03:37.183]  And then the very countries that lead the world in stopping that, we are to blame.
[01:03:37.523 --> 01:03:39.145]  We are bad, the Pope says.
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:41.721]  It's crap, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:42.401 --> 01:03:44.862]  And now, are you a slave in China under the CCP?
[01:03:44.962 --> 01:03:45.442]  Damn right.
[01:03:46.062 --> 01:03:48.924]  Are you a slave in many radical Muslim countries under Islam?
[01:03:48.944 --> 01:03:49.464]  Yes, you are.
[01:03:49.844 --> 01:03:51.165]  Are you free in America?
[01:03:51.625 --> 01:04:00.349]  You're so free here, the left says they want access to your five-year-old to teach them how to have sex, or they're not free.
[01:04:00.749 --> 01:04:02.470]  We're the far extreme.
[01:04:02.890 --> 01:04:09.773]  You've got extreme fascism and authoritarianism and radical Islam and chi-com over here, where they execute you if you're gay.
[01:04:11.161 --> 01:04:15.225]  And right over here we got America, where we let pedophiles have access to children!
[01:04:18.048 --> 01:04:24.494]  Instead of following God's law of being tolerant, being loving and nice, but protecting our children, and not letting people commit crimes.
[01:04:24.754 --> 01:04:25.555]  That's where we should be.
[01:04:25.976 --> 01:04:31.981]  Not over here in communist fascism, not over here in authoritarianism, but over here in the middle of the real political spectrum.
[01:04:32.021 --> 01:04:37.867]   Instead, we're way over here And you're never going to say, shake the left.
[01:04:38.328 --> 01:04:40.350]  There's never going to be enough to make them happy.
[01:04:40.871 --> 01:04:56.288]  I mean, you know, like Drag Queen Story Time, where now the teachers in elementary school make the 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 year olds go to the school auditorium to watch their male teacher dress as a woman and shake their ass?
[01:04:58.757 --> 01:05:01.798]  It's all about stop me.
[01:05:02.118 --> 01:05:02.918]  Tell me to quit.
[01:05:03.258 --> 01:05:04.619]  No one ever told me to stop.
[01:05:04.979 --> 01:05:06.379]  No one ever gave me parameters.
[01:05:06.759 --> 01:05:08.199]  No one ever stood up to me.
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:10.220]  And so now they're like, I get your children.
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:12.481]  I'm going to give them condoms.
[01:05:12.721 --> 01:05:15.861]  I'm going to teach your five-year-old daughter how to shove a sex toy in her.
[01:05:16.061 --> 01:05:18.002]  I'm going to teach your five-year-old son how to masturbate.
[01:05:18.222 --> 01:05:21.483]  And if you don't like it, I'll call you bad and you'll bow down to me!
[01:05:22.796 --> 01:05:27.017]  She got the Muslims ready to put all the women in beekeeper suits and cut everybody's heads off.
[01:05:27.057 --> 01:05:27.877]  They don't do what they're told.
[01:05:28.198 --> 01:05:30.718]  Over here, the Chi-Coms doing the same thing.
[01:05:30.898 --> 01:05:32.739]  And then right over here, you've got what America is.
[01:05:32.759 --> 01:05:33.579]  I don't know who's worse.
[01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:38.701]  You know, I gotta say, probably the Chi-Coms aren't even as bad.
[01:05:39.481 --> 01:05:41.061]  Or the radical Muslims as the left.
[01:05:41.081 --> 01:05:50.064]  Cause they, cause I mean, you don't see a bloodthirsty desire, even by the Muslims, to try to get the children and teach the children how to have sex with each other.
[01:05:51.843 --> 01:05:54.284]  I'm just telling you, ladies and gentlemen, we better get back to God.
[01:05:54.304 --> 01:05:58.525]  We better get our act together right now, because we're going under judgment right now.
[01:05:58.545 --> 01:06:01.505]  And we look at, again, the headlines.
[01:06:01.925 --> 01:06:03.326]  Oh, Biden's an idiot!
[01:06:03.506 --> 01:06:07.007]  Idiotic policy shutting off a thousand pipelines, or two thousand.
[01:06:07.507 --> 01:06:08.787]  Idiotic opening the border.
[01:06:08.907 --> 01:06:09.787]  It's not idiotic!
[01:06:10.107 --> 01:06:12.308]  He was ordered to shut this country down!
[01:06:12.608 --> 01:06:23.370]  He was put in there to put the carbon taxes in to shut us down so all our investment goes to China and Mexico and India because the globalists own the people there and they're going to own us soon.
[01:06:26.291 --> 01:06:28.151]  Biden doesn't have idiotic policies.
[01:06:28.411 --> 01:06:38.593]  He has New World Order economic warfare policies to totally bankrupt you and bring you to your knees so they can dictate the terms of your surrender.
[01:06:40.953 --> 01:06:42.614]  Biden is an idiotic!
[01:06:42.894 --> 01:06:46.695]  The people behind him are super evil and have got their act together!
[01:06:46.936 --> 01:06:52.978]  And you better wake up to who they are, and you better stand up for your interests, or you're gonna lose everything you've got!
[01:06:55.819 --> 01:07:00.361]  And I'll say it again, you can sit around and pretend that you're part of the power structure.
[01:07:00.882 --> 01:07:03.203]  You can sit around and play games all day, but you're not.
[01:07:04.223 --> 01:07:08.785]  This thing is evil and smells like death itself, because it is death.
[01:07:11.124 --> 01:07:12.865]  And I love the Chinese people, great people.
[01:07:13.185 --> 01:07:14.845]  So sad they're under New World Order slavery.
[01:07:14.865 --> 01:07:19.787]  So sad the Rockefellers with George Herbert Walker Bush went and took it over in the 70s and set this up.
[01:07:19.807 --> 01:07:23.389]  It could be such a beacon of freedom, such a beacon of ingenuity, such a beacon.
[01:07:23.609 --> 01:07:25.149]  But no, it could be the new America, but not.
[01:07:25.409 --> 01:07:25.810]  No, it's not.
[01:07:26.130 --> 01:07:39.255]  It's the New World Order command base now, and it runs our government, and it's running our country on the ground, and it's running lockdown drills right now to show us that we have to follow them and their chicken little scenario, and we cannot stand to let it happen.
[01:07:39.975 --> 01:07:41.035]  New lockdowns are coming.
[01:07:40.855 --> 01:07:56.213]  We'll talk about it when we come right back.
[01:07:56.019 --> 01:07:58.019]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:07:58.019 --> 01:08:05.019]  [music]
[01:08:05.019 --> 01:08:07.019]  Shall we see Stephen Colbert?
[01:08:07.304 --> 01:08:09.485]  I'm not going to waste your time with the clip, but I've got it.
[01:08:09.545 --> 01:08:10.366]  It's on InfoWars.
[01:08:11.086 --> 01:08:14.349]  With the headline, Elon Musk to take over Twitter to censor.
[01:08:14.989 --> 01:08:18.512]  No, the globalists took over Twitter and all the rest of the media to censor.
[01:08:18.912 --> 01:08:22.495]  Elon Musk said he's going to take Twitter back to end the censorship.
[01:08:22.835 --> 01:08:24.076]  But what's the headline with Colbert?
[01:08:25.417 --> 01:08:26.518]  Oh, you want to censor it.
[01:08:26.558 --> 01:08:28.780]  He went on to say, nobody's censoring me.
[01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:31.421]  I can say F you Elon Musk all I want.
[01:08:31.622 --> 01:08:34.444]  Well, yeah, because that's an approved statement.
[01:08:35.805 --> 01:08:43.066]  It's so elementary how they're lying and so provable to anybody who's awake that he's literally abusing his viewers.
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:45.901]  So we have this blast from the past.
[01:08:46.041 --> 01:08:56.606]  MSNBC has the daughter of the famous war criminals, Zbigniew Brzezinski, with the famous Psycho Joe, who got found with the dead intern in his Florida congressional office, but that's a side issue.
[01:08:57.406 --> 01:08:59.407]  MSNBC blast from the past.
[01:08:59.827 --> 01:09:03.669]  It's our job to control how people think, not Elon Musk.
[01:09:04.129 --> 01:09:07.931]  So here they are admitting it's their job to control your mind.
[01:09:09.472 --> 01:09:14.752]   who were Trump voters and are still Trump supporters, they go, "Yeah, you guys are going crazy."
[01:09:14.752 --> 01:09:20.432]   He's doing - what are you so surprised about? He's doing exactly what he said he's going to do.
[01:09:20.432 --> 01:09:26.511]   Well, and I think that the dangerous, you know, edges here are that he's trying to undermine the
[01:09:26.511 --> 01:09:29.233]  media, trying to make up his own facts, and...
[01:09:29.445 --> 01:09:42.171]  And it could be that while unemployment and the economy worsens, he could have undermined the messaging so much that he can actually control exactly what people think.
[01:09:42.331 --> 01:09:44.152]  And that is our job.
[01:09:44.672 --> 01:09:48.014]  If you look at the issues, Yamiche is right.
[01:09:48.074 --> 01:09:49.635]  He's doing exactly what he said.
[01:09:49.655 --> 01:09:50.215]  Right.
[01:09:52.336 --> 01:09:56.480]  So that's them claiming Trump wouldn't fix the economy, wouldn't get people jobs, which he did.
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:59.383]  And they're saying that's our job to control people's minds.
[01:10:00.344 --> 01:10:03.206]  Talk about saying the secret part out loud.
[01:10:03.787 --> 01:10:06.750]  I mean, these people are just master criminals.
[01:10:07.290 --> 01:10:08.091]  Totally pathetic.
[01:10:09.633 --> 01:10:28.191]   So, let's take, I'm sorry for TV viewers, this clip's been out for a few weeks, but Imagine a big giant fat woman probably weighs 500 pounds walking into a McDonald's and shaking her ass one foot in front of small children's faces unannounced.
[01:10:32.593 --> 01:10:41.656]  I was at the mall yesterday getting a present from my mom and I saw that the ads on a lot of the new stores were like giant obese women like this woman.
[01:10:43.936 --> 01:10:45.937]  That was her hiking her leg and pissing on him.
[01:10:45.957 --> 01:10:48.517]  She goes over to her family of evil white devils who deserve it.
[01:10:48.537 --> 01:10:49.258]  She's a black lady.
[01:10:50.038 --> 01:10:53.119]  And she probably weighs probably 500 pounds, excuse me.
[01:10:53.779 --> 01:10:55.219]  Each leg weighs at least 200 pounds.
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:58.020]  And she goes over and does this.
[01:10:58.661 --> 01:11:01.281]  And then because they don't like it, they're bad.
[01:11:02.382 --> 01:11:03.822]  The internet, the media said.
[01:11:06.003 --> 01:11:08.103]  So that's the mind control here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:08.744 --> 01:11:12.985]  But I wanted to get to these clips because these are really, really important.
[01:11:14.755 --> 01:11:24.640]  These are clips from a new Tucker Carlson documentary that part of it got shot on a little piece of land that I have here in Austin, Texas.
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:34.504]  I didn't go out to the shoot, but let me tell you, I sent the crew out there because Tucker's producer wanted to use a central Texas piece of property to shoot at, and so they shot some of it.
[01:11:34.905 --> 01:11:36.805]  So they do kind of the manly man type deals.
[01:11:37.506 --> 01:11:41.027]  But the issue here is that this isn't just the end of man.
[01:11:42.506 --> 01:11:49.471]  This is the end of the humans as we know it, and what we need to counter all this is men standing up and men being men.
[01:11:49.891 --> 01:11:51.913]  So here's a few clips from Tucker's new documentary.
[01:11:51.933 --> 01:11:59.078]  One of the biggest stories of our lifetimes is the total collapse in testosterone levels in American men.
[01:11:59.518 --> 01:12:06.744]  Those levels are declining by roughly 10% per decade, completely changing the way people are at the most fundamental level.
[01:12:06.844 --> 01:12:08.545]  NIH does not seem interested in this at all.
[01:12:08.565 --> 01:12:09.285]  It's not a big deal.
[01:12:10.475 --> 01:12:14.616]  We think it is a huge deal, so we want to know what's causing it and what you can do about it.
[01:12:14.796 --> 01:12:18.357]  That's the topic of our upcoming documentary called The End of Men.
[01:12:18.377 --> 01:12:25.377]  Here's a look at the trailer.
[01:12:25.377 --> 01:12:27.537]  That's my 50 Kelvin shot out there.
[01:12:27.537 --> 01:12:29.537]  [laughs]
[01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:35.441]  This is... And again, he's putting a red light on his testicles which boosts his testosterone.
[01:12:35.461 --> 01:12:37.582]  This will trigger the lymph tards like never before.
[01:12:39.159 --> 01:12:40.220]  You're in hard times.
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:47.964]  Well, hard iron sharpens iron, as they say, and those hard times inevitably produce ice bands.
[01:12:47.984 --> 01:12:49.986]  Joe Rogan does it every day.
[01:12:50.006 --> 01:12:50.546]  He looks great.
[01:12:50.606 --> 01:12:51.467]  He looks incredible.
[01:12:51.527 --> 01:12:52.667]  Strong enough to survive.
[01:12:53.908 --> 01:12:58.148]   and then they re-establish order and so the cycle begins again
[01:12:58.148 --> 01:13:08.395]   okay so there you go Definitely going to trigger the libtards.
[01:13:08.435 --> 01:13:11.496]  Worse than his January 6th documentary.
[01:13:11.576 --> 01:13:18.678]  And I mean, I'm glad they shot part of it here in Central Texas with us, but just obviously a lot of entertainment value to this.
[01:13:19.438 --> 01:13:24.240]  Again, designed to absolutely trigger the leftists.
[01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:31.662]  But this is, I want them to stop putting chemicals in the water that makes the freaking frogs gay.
[01:13:32.628 --> 01:13:37.392]  Because the atrazine, the testosterone down by 90%, the sperm down by 96%.
[01:13:39.094 --> 01:13:42.496]  Western men, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young.
[01:13:43.504 --> 01:13:45.524]  They're losing their sperm count.
[01:13:45.584 --> 01:13:47.665]  Their genital sizes are shrinking.
[01:13:48.085 --> 01:13:53.286]  We are being chemically hit, by design, that Global has admitted, with things to get rid of men.
[01:13:53.566 --> 01:14:05.089]  And you see them saying, masculinity is toxic, being a leader is toxic, standing up for your family is toxic, because they want a bunch of people that they can roll right over.
[01:14:05.529 --> 01:14:06.749]  That is their plan.
[01:14:09.410 --> 01:14:19.214]   So I'm really, really glad that Tucker's doing this and I can't wait to see it, but who can deny sperm counts down over 90% in the last 50 years?
[01:14:19.634 --> 01:14:21.335]  Who can deny fertility is way down?
[01:14:21.655 --> 01:14:22.216]  Look it up.
[01:14:22.316 --> 01:14:31.522]  It's not debatable, but I remember even Stephen Colbert and others making fun of me as a talking point years ago that Jones claims they're emasculating us.
[01:14:32.723 --> 01:14:34.564]  Jones claims there's an attack on men.
[01:14:34.924 --> 01:14:35.785]  Excuse me?
[01:14:36.405 --> 01:14:36.886]  Type in.
[01:14:38.098 --> 01:14:40.561]  University teaches all masculinity bad.
[01:14:40.981 --> 01:14:41.862]  Men are bad.
[01:14:42.162 --> 01:14:45.806]  Hollywood women raise their sons as daughters because men are bad.
[01:14:46.106 --> 01:15:00.681]  This is a sick, globalist cult of banks that have already conquered us and have robots taking over right now that don't want any men that could possibly resist it or stand up to it.
[01:15:02.281 --> 01:15:03.502]  But I trust the women as well.
[01:15:03.522 --> 01:15:04.323]  They're going to stand up.
[01:15:04.343 --> 01:15:05.744]  But that's where we are.
[01:15:05.764 --> 01:15:06.425]  We're going to go to break.
[01:15:06.845 --> 01:15:07.706]  Got a bunch of clips.
[01:15:08.367 --> 01:15:09.928]  Final 10 minutes coming up.
[01:15:10.049 --> 01:15:12.751]  Next segment, or 11 minutes, next segment, then the War Rooms.
[01:15:13.192 --> 01:15:14.313]  Great host comes in here.
[01:15:15.093 --> 01:15:20.759]  I'll tell you, Sunday live with Owen Schroer and Christy Lee and Harrison Smith's been out of the park good.
[01:15:21.259 --> 01:15:24.462]  And it's 6 to 8 p.m., only six minutes of ads an hour.
[01:15:25.103 --> 01:15:26.725]  All the network ads have been canceled.
[01:15:27.551 --> 01:15:28.491]  It's on radio and TV.
[01:15:29.012 --> 01:15:30.812]  Only local station ads are there.
[01:15:31.192 --> 01:15:31.993]  Six minutes an hour.
[01:15:32.093 --> 01:15:32.853]  Very exciting.
[01:15:33.213 --> 01:15:35.654]  Two hours with Sunday Live.
[01:15:35.934 --> 01:15:37.534]  Sundays, 6 to 8 p.m.
[01:15:37.855 --> 01:15:41.096]  I've been doing Alex Jones Live here Sunday for 16 years.
[01:15:41.616 --> 01:15:43.677]  Been doing the weekday show at 11 a.m.
[01:15:43.757 --> 01:15:44.757]  for 25 years.
[01:15:44.777 --> 01:15:46.898]  I want to thank you all for keeping us on air.
[01:15:46.918 --> 01:15:47.618]  I want to just say this.
[01:15:49.755 --> 01:15:52.136]  We have hit our main point.
[01:15:52.276 --> 01:15:54.737]  We have entered our Valhalla.
[01:15:54.777 --> 01:15:56.498]  We have come into our own.
[01:15:56.818 --> 01:15:58.099]  The world knows we were right.
[01:15:58.199 --> 01:16:00.720]  We're doing our most important work ever right now.
[01:16:02.221 --> 01:16:05.623]  And so, now is the time to share the links from InfoWars.com.
[01:16:05.963 --> 01:16:10.705]  Black Sheep, Verboten, Outlaw, True, Americana, The Essence of Victory.
[01:16:11.285 --> 01:16:14.367]  And now is the time to support us at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:16:14.427 --> 01:16:17.749]  So, our most important work is now happening.
[01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:24.134]  This minute, we are entering the most important period in our entire existence here, 28 years.
[01:16:24.234 --> 01:16:31.820]  So I ask you, spread the word about the broadcast, pray for the broadcast, and buy products because I am completely maxed out.
[01:16:32.161 --> 01:16:34.443]  I had a small savings of like $3 million.
[01:16:34.583 --> 01:16:37.465]  I've almost blown through that, keeping all the great crew employed.
[01:16:38.226 --> 01:16:41.248]  I don't want to get to a point where I stop buying product out in the future.
[01:16:41.268 --> 01:16:45.268]   Because anything we're selling at Infowarsstore.com, we have in stock.
[01:16:45.268 --> 01:16:51.307]   But I'm in the catch-22 right now of not having enough money to buy future stock to be able
[01:16:51.307 --> 01:16:52.307]  to be on the future.
[01:16:52.307 --> 01:16:56.347]   So I've just stopped buying product, run for six, eight months with plenty of money, and
[01:16:56.347 --> 01:16:59.587]  just shut it down?
[01:16:59.587 --> 01:17:00.868]  It's been a big run, folks.
[01:17:00.868 --> 01:17:05.587]   Or will you buy a lot of extra product right now so I can buy more products in the future?
[01:17:05.587 --> 01:17:06.868]  I need your help.
[01:17:06.868 --> 01:17:07.868]  I'm not a BS-er.
[01:17:08.294 --> 01:17:11.476]  Believe me, we won't be here in eight, nine months if you don't support us.
[01:17:11.896 --> 01:17:12.616]  Please do today.

[01:17:49.708 --> 01:17:51.937]  edition of...
[01:17:49.715 --> 01:17:53.517]  Owen Schroer and Sunday Lives coming up here just in a few minutes.
[01:17:53.958 --> 01:17:58.861]  They'll be taking your calls and a lot more, but let's run through these other stories.
[01:17:58.881 --> 01:18:01.223]  I've already mentioned some of these, but I want to drill into them right now.
[01:18:02.104 --> 01:18:14.353]  Court brief, Biden releases 756,000 border crossers, population larger than Boston, into American communities since taking office.
[01:18:15.558 --> 01:18:22.781]  And we went down there just a few months ago, and Border Patrol met with us privately and said, we catch 1 out of 10.
[01:18:25.062 --> 01:18:33.906]  And then Biden releases almost all of them, even convicted bank robbers, child molesters, arsonists, you name it.
[01:18:35.327 --> 01:18:37.088]  They catch men with kidnapped children.
[01:18:37.408 --> 01:18:38.128]  They just let them go.
[01:18:40.569 --> 01:18:54.072]   And now, in a court brief, Biden releases, according to Border Patrol, 756,000 people in the last year, and as Border Patrol said, they catch one in ten.
[01:18:55.112 --> 01:18:58.694]  So that number is closer to eight million.
[01:18:59.714 --> 01:19:01.295]  Seven and a half million.
[01:19:01.715 --> 01:19:05.537]  We reported an eight million number six months ago from the border.
[01:19:05.557 --> 01:19:05.977]  There it is.
[01:19:08.317 --> 01:19:19.688]  Biden administration resumed secret charter flights of young migrants as young as six years old from southern border to Westchester Airport in New York.
[01:19:20.629 --> 01:19:21.450]  Got video of that.
[01:19:23.413 --> 01:19:24.514]  Where are they going?
[01:19:24.994 --> 01:19:25.975]  Who is getting them?
[01:19:26.376 --> 01:19:28.357]  Well, not supposed to ask that question.
[01:19:28.858 --> 01:19:32.161]  The FBI certainly doesn't, because they've been ordered not to.
[01:19:32.501 --> 01:19:40.028]  Well, they're now aiding and abetting the child trafficking, ladies and gentlemen, which is the very essence of this evil.
[01:19:41.189 --> 01:19:43.051]  Here's another report here out of Zero Hedge.
[01:19:43.371 --> 01:19:50.371]  Teen opioid deaths have surged 356% thanks to RISE and Fentanyl.
[01:19:50.371 --> 01:19:56.371]  Millions of deaths the last few years from this.
[01:19:56.319 --> 01:19:57.240]  But oh, don't worry.
[01:19:57.780 --> 01:19:59.542]  They're looking for white supremacists.
[01:20:00.122 --> 01:20:01.563]  They're looking to censor everybody.
[01:20:02.904 --> 01:20:03.744]  Here's another report.
[01:20:03.844 --> 01:20:11.710]  Fourth bus of illegal migrants, how about just invaders and stop using the UN name, from Texas border arrives in Washington, D.C.
[01:20:16.169 --> 01:20:18.691]  And they're saying that Abbott's committing a crime shipping him there.
[01:20:18.711 --> 01:20:21.332]  Maybe he is, but what about the crime of letting him in?
[01:20:21.392 --> 01:20:23.914]  And why are they being sent to Martha's Vineyard?
[01:20:24.094 --> 01:20:25.835]  Because they don't care if we dump him off in D.C.
[01:20:26.235 --> 01:20:29.157]  Dump him off in Martha's Vineyard at Obama's house.
[01:20:29.117 --> 01:20:31.117]  It'll stop real fast.
[01:20:31.117 --> 01:20:37.237]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:20:37.237 --> 01:20:39.837]  And here's some of the footage.
[01:20:40.054 --> 01:20:42.716]  Of these little kids being offloaded to go God knows where.
[01:20:43.276 --> 01:20:44.137]  Here's the next report.
[01:20:44.577 --> 01:20:45.718]  Emergency alert!
[01:20:46.278 --> 01:20:55.825]  On the heels of rail carriers canceling grain shipments, CF industry warns that fertilizer rail shipments are now being halted during spring planting.
[01:20:56.246 --> 01:21:02.570]  So there's not just massive shortages in fertilizer, now they're halting the shipments of it.
[01:21:03.191 --> 01:21:06.273]  Again, the civilization is breaking down by design.
[01:21:08.146 --> 01:21:16.613]  Federal government approves release of millions of genetically engineered mosquitoes into California, the Western Journal reports, and Texas and Florida.
[01:21:17.133 --> 01:21:21.597]  GMO created by Bill Gates to do God knows what.
[01:21:21.677 --> 01:21:23.558]  They're doing it totally illegal.
[01:21:27.621 --> 01:21:33.526]  Every Fed hiking cycle ends with default and bankruptcy of government, banks, and investors.
[01:21:34.447 --> 01:21:37.069]  All over the world, the bankers have run the same operation.
[01:21:38.583 --> 01:21:44.002]   create endless fiat currency for themselves, buy up all the infrastructure, all the intellectual
[01:21:44.002 --> 01:21:47.583]   property, and then implode it all and leave the public with the debt,
[01:21:47.583 --> 01:21:52.583]   impoverishing them so you control them, and then pushing a universal basic income.
[01:21:52.583 --> 01:21:59.583]   And my one big criticism of Elon Musk now is he's like, "Oh, I'm anti-vaccine, oh, I'm anti-censorship, and oh,
[01:21:59.583 --> 01:22:04.583]   but I want you to have a universal basic income because robots are going to replace you."
[01:22:04.583 --> 01:22:09.583]   We should decide to build a pro-human world and not a robot world.
[01:22:09.583 --> 01:22:21.583]  So that's some of the news we've got on that front today.
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:23.041]  Now let's move on.
[01:22:25.462 --> 01:22:27.764]  Let's move on to this story.
[01:22:28.945 --> 01:22:31.046]  They don't have the Bill Maher clip here in a moment.
[01:22:32.247 --> 01:22:34.749]  But let's move on to this little stack.
[01:22:37.991 --> 01:22:43.675]  CIA bombshell, Zero Hedge reports, the suspend data was user-created.
[01:22:44.582 --> 01:22:46.925]  I like Zero Hedge, but man, what a weak headline.
[01:22:47.426 --> 01:22:48.287]  I read the article.
[01:22:49.689 --> 01:22:53.294]  I followed the links to corporate and government filings.
[01:22:54.195 --> 01:22:54.956]  It's a great report.
[01:22:56.428 --> 01:23:07.074]  And I'm like, it ought to be CIA confirms in federal filing they illegally spied on candidate Trump, President-elect Trump, and President Trump.
[01:23:07.474 --> 01:23:08.315]  What a scandal.
[01:23:08.595 --> 01:23:14.118]  I mean, Nixon had people break into his competition's psychiatrist's office, and it was the worst thing on earth.
[01:23:14.358 --> 01:23:16.199]  But they do it, and it's no big deal.
[01:23:18.885 --> 01:23:26.633]  And you read the article, the CIA confirms they were spying on Trump and they confirmed that it was made up data by Hillary's lawyer, all of it.
[01:23:27.394 --> 01:23:28.755]  But they still followed it and did it.
[01:23:31.398 --> 01:23:32.039]  Just incredible.
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:40.988]  Absolutely incredible to live here in this day and time and to see this happening.
[01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:52.905]  Here's a quick clip that's really illustrative of where we are and how people not joining the pro-human movement, people not joining the American movement, people not joining the new renaissance movement are fools!
[01:23:53.905 --> 01:23:56.086]  I don't care if you're an academic.
[01:23:56.546 --> 01:23:57.867]  I don't care if you're in the government.
[01:23:57.947 --> 01:23:59.287]  I don't care if you're a private sector.
[01:23:59.387 --> 01:24:01.308]  I don't care who you are.
[01:24:01.788 --> 01:24:07.991]  Why would you join in on something that's anti-human and will destroy society in pro-war?
[01:24:09.656 --> 01:24:13.719]  So Bill Maher was here last week on the Joe Rogan podcast down the street from our studios.
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:22.866]  And Bill Maher tells Joe Rogan, Dems, the party of no common sense, will get their ass kicked in the midterms.
[01:24:23.366 --> 01:24:25.868]  I'll play part of the clip, the full clip is on Infowars.com.
[01:24:26.889 --> 01:24:30.892]  But the reason it's important is, Bill Maher's been part of the establishment.
[01:24:31.212 --> 01:24:38.496]  He's gone along with it, but now he's anti-lockdown, he's anti-vaccine, because he gets that he'll be destroyed in the process.
[01:24:38.997 --> 01:24:42.879]  Why should he be part of something that is destructive to his own life?
[01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:50.164]  Even the parasites are going to get it at one point or another, that going along with Klaus Schwab means you're the chump.
[01:24:52.125 --> 01:24:53.786]  You're not going to have prosperity.
[01:24:54.106 --> 01:24:55.467]  You're not going to have stability.
[01:24:55.727 --> 01:24:57.288]  You're not going to have checks and balances.
[01:24:57.528 --> 01:24:58.948]  You're not going to have due process.
[01:24:59.229 --> 01:25:01.090]  You're not going to have a social safety net.
[01:25:01.390 --> 01:25:04.831]  You're not going to have a social contract under the New World Order.
[01:25:05.292 --> 01:25:07.673]  It means a broken social contract.
[01:25:08.373 --> 01:25:15.177]  It means a hellish, depopulated, impoverished, feudalist, dangerous, horrible system.
[01:25:15.457 --> 01:25:24.372]   So please, whatever your reason, self-preservation or you love God, here on Easter, Do the right thing and don't be part of this.
[01:25:25.172 --> 01:25:27.172]  Here's part of what Bill Maher had to say.
[01:25:27.172 --> 01:25:34.172]   Well, I think that's because we are both seen as people who are sort of like commonsensical.
[01:25:34.434 --> 01:25:40.718]  And that is what there is a hunger for, I think, in America more than anything, is common sense.
[01:25:40.818 --> 01:25:41.098]  Yes.
[01:25:42.559 --> 01:25:44.501]  Away from the extremes.
[01:25:44.521 --> 01:25:48.883]  I mean, when people say to me, you know, don't you think you've gotten more conservative?
[01:25:48.943 --> 01:25:49.844]  No, I haven't.
[01:25:50.244 --> 01:25:51.785]  The left has gotten goofier.
[01:25:51.885 --> 01:25:52.165]  Yes.
[01:25:52.406 --> 01:25:57.929]  So I seem more conservative, maybe, but, like, it's not me who changed.
[01:25:58.249 --> 01:25:59.750]  I feel I'm the same guy.
[01:26:00.111 --> 01:26:06.493]   But five years ago, You know, we hadn't spent six trillion dollars to stay home.
[01:26:06.653 --> 01:26:09.014]  I mean, I understand we had to do something with the pandemic.
[01:26:09.115 --> 01:26:14.118]  I'm not sure that was, you know, I mean, I remember when a trillion dollars was too much to spend on anything.
[01:26:14.138 --> 01:26:18.561]  We didn't spend a trillion to bail out the economy in 2008.
[01:26:20.603 --> 01:26:21.724]  So we didn't do that.
[01:26:21.924 --> 01:26:26.167]  Five years ago, no one was talking about abolishing the police.
[01:26:27.677 --> 01:26:34.641]  You know, there was no talk about pregnant men.
[01:26:35.922 --> 01:26:38.143]  Looting was still illegal.
[01:26:38.223 --> 01:26:40.205]  Right.
[01:26:40.345 --> 01:26:41.966]  Isn't that crazy?
[01:26:42.146 --> 01:26:43.427]  So have I changed?
[01:26:43.507 --> 01:26:43.707]  No.
[01:26:43.767 --> 01:26:50.811]  Because if someone had said 20 years ago, I'm not sure looting is a bad thing, I would have opposed it then.
[01:26:51.571 --> 01:26:52.612]  So I haven't changed.
[01:26:53.252 --> 01:26:58.459]   But that, I think, is what there is this hunger for, is this sort of Common sense?
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:01.361]  You know, centrism is such a wishy-washy word.
[01:27:03.302 --> 01:27:04.283]  Hey Bill, let me help you.
[01:27:04.323 --> 01:27:05.944]  It's called civilization.
[01:27:06.824 --> 01:27:08.465]  It's called a social contract.
[01:27:08.505 --> 01:27:12.568]  People are hungry for a government and corporations that aren't out to kill them.
[01:27:13.048 --> 01:27:19.031]  But Klaus Schwab and the left believe there's too many people, so they believe they're collapsing civilization for our own good.
[01:27:19.592 --> 01:27:21.773]  Figure that out, Bill Maher.
[01:27:21.993 --> 01:27:23.074]  I know Joe Rogan knows.
[01:27:23.654 --> 01:27:24.475]  He's finally getting it.
[01:27:25.735 --> 01:27:26.496]  Or we're all screwed.
[01:27:27.369 --> 01:27:28.590]  I'm not on some high horse here.
[01:27:28.650 --> 01:27:30.350]  I don't want to be better than Bill Maher or Joe Rogan.
[01:27:30.711 --> 01:27:32.711]  I'm just saying, get with the program or we all die.
[01:27:32.731 --> 01:27:36.213]  And then the money you've got means nothing in a collapsed civilization.
[01:27:37.794 --> 01:27:39.915]  The globalists or psychopaths have got to be opposed.
[01:27:40.435 --> 01:27:42.216]  Please financially keep us on air.
[01:27:42.656 --> 01:27:44.617]  I need your support or we're going to start imploding.
[01:27:45.438 --> 01:27:48.500]  With the supply chain breakdowns and the inflation, we can't be here.
[01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:49.561]  We need your support.
[01:27:49.601 --> 01:27:56.925]  So thank you for going to infowarestore.com right now and getting great supplements, great books, great films, great t-shirts, whatever you do.
[01:27:56.945 --> 01:27:58.607]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:27:58.647 --> 01:28:03.670]  I want you to redouble your efforts because without you we are going to shut down just like America is.
[01:28:04.130 --> 01:28:05.631]  America needs your help, so do we.
[01:28:05.931 --> 01:28:07.172]  Owen Schroeder is about to take over.
[01:28:11.635 --> 01:28:12.976]  Welcome to Intermission.
[01:28:13.377 --> 01:28:26.377]  [Music]
[01:28:26.377 --> 01:28:29.377]  Yeah, animation.
[01:28:29.377 --> 01:28:40.377]  [Music]
[01:28:40.377 --> 01:28:53.377]  [Music]
[01:28:53.377 --> 01:28:55.377]  There is a war on for your mind!
[01:28:55.741 --> 01:28:57.863]  You need to listen to Alex Jones.
[01:28:58.144 --> 01:29:12.264]   Infowars.com We return you now to your regularly scheduled program.
[01:29:12.264 --> 01:29:18.264]   There's a lot of national news out there about Infowars and whether or not we're going to declare bankruptcy.
[01:29:18.968 --> 01:29:36.300]  Well, I've told listeners we've been investigating different types of bankruptcy because I told you we're maxed out and I don't want to lay off our employees and I can't fight the Democratic Party and George Soros and all these folks, Bloomberg, that are financing these operations against us.
[01:29:38.228 --> 01:29:39.149]  I have been looking at that.
[01:29:40.350 --> 01:29:44.112]  And it just shows that they've got moles inside everywhere.
[01:29:44.132 --> 01:29:51.638]  And if I'm even talking to people about it, then it's in Bloomberg and on ABC Nightly News and CNN right now.
[01:29:52.398 --> 01:29:55.601]  So, in fact, the incredible thing is none of this was even talked to the crew here.
[01:29:56.261 --> 01:29:58.023]  So basically people tap on our phones.
[01:29:59.023 --> 01:30:06.549]  And that shows you how they see shutting us down as the number one mission for what they're about to do to everybody.
[01:30:07.711 --> 01:30:10.112]  So we're a real canary in the coal mine when we go dark.
[01:30:11.033 --> 01:30:14.775]  People ask, how do I handle all the attacks, all the lies, all the red cords, all of it.
[01:30:15.335 --> 01:30:18.016]  And I'm very resigned because I'm on the same ship as you.
[01:30:18.537 --> 01:30:20.578]  My children are on the same ship as you, planet Earth.
[01:30:21.178 --> 01:30:22.679]  And I know I'm right about all this stuff.
[01:30:23.579 --> 01:30:24.940]  I knew about this stuff when I was a little kid.
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:31.163]  I've grown up understanding it because I had some family that worked inside of it and told me what was going on.
[01:30:31.643 --> 01:30:32.104]  And you know what?
[01:30:32.144 --> 01:30:32.684]  They were right.
[01:30:32.764 --> 01:30:33.524]  My family was right.
[01:30:33.544 --> 01:30:34.165]  They were good people.
[01:30:35.049 --> 01:30:37.380]  And they thought they were fighting for America and later learned they weren't.
[01:30:38.164 --> 01:30:39.912]  But the issue is, is that...
[01:30:41.328 --> 01:30:42.148]  We're in this together.
[01:30:43.048 --> 01:30:48.750]  And so people look at me in a lot of trouble and all the things that are happening and, you know, January 6th, people want to put me in jail and all that.
[01:30:49.150 --> 01:30:58.132]  That shows how sick America is, how on its deathbed it is, how much trouble we're all in as the border implodes, the dollars devalue, the crime explodes and all that.
[01:30:58.452 --> 01:31:08.015]  And people that work for the system that pretend, oh, you know, in the media or the legal system or these judges or any of them that pretend they're on a winning team attacking me, they're attacking themselves.
[01:31:08.635 --> 01:31:10.597]  They're destroying their own social safety network.
[01:31:10.617 --> 01:31:21.608]  They're destroying their own chivalry and their own due process and throwing their birthright in the garbage can or in the fire.
