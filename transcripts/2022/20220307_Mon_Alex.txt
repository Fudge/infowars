[00:00.000 --> 00:10.520]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[00:10.520 --> 00:17.440]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you've got one!
[00:17.440 --> 00:22.840]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:22.840 --> 00:29.200]  Hollywood, the establishment, the mainline churches, the major corporations, I mean,
[00:29.200 --> 00:31.960]  they are on another planet.
[00:31.960 --> 00:35.640]  So are you arguing for throwing out the constitution?
[00:35.640 --> 00:37.200]  Should the constitution be thrown out?
[00:37.200 --> 00:38.200]  What do we do?
[00:38.200 --> 00:41.000]  Is it a living document or is it a sacred document?
[00:41.000 --> 00:43.320]  It's certainly not sacred, all right, let's start there.
[00:43.320 --> 00:45.560]  The constitution is kind of trash.
[00:45.560 --> 00:50.240]  I think listeners and viewers know things aren't going to get very nice the next decade.
[00:50.240 --> 00:54.440]  The globalist plan to have 90% of everybody dead by 2030.
[00:54.440 --> 01:00.840]  What do you think is a viable figure that Gaia, that the planet can sustain?
[01:00.840 --> 01:06.880]  I would guess living the way we do, not more than one billion, probably less.
[01:06.880 --> 01:15.040]  Such is going to be the level of misery and panic across the world that there are bound
[01:15.040 --> 01:20.640]  to be the most cataclysmic conflicts, wars, struggles, simply for survival.
[01:20.640 --> 01:29.600]  Because again, whenever events like that come along, when there's huge floods, famines,
[01:29.600 --> 01:33.920]  there's a certain amount of struggling, but there's also an awful lot of good come from
[01:33.920 --> 01:34.920]  it.
[01:34.920 --> 01:41.040]  When confronted like that, ordinary people show extraordinary heroism and helpfulness
[01:41.040 --> 01:46.920]  towards others, as well as being looters and vandals and so on.
[01:46.920 --> 01:50.960]  It's just a thoroughly disturbing thing, and it will happen.
[01:50.960 --> 01:55.120]  That are going to end civilization as we know it, and when civilization breaks down, go
[01:55.120 --> 02:00.760]  watch a movie like The Road Warrior, and that's going to be like a vacation spot.
[02:00.760 --> 02:04.200]  That hellish dystopic nightmare of future.
[02:04.200 --> 02:16.440]  I remember a time of chaos, ruined dreams, this wasted land, but most of all, I remember
[02:16.440 --> 02:24.160]  The Road Warrior, the man we called Max, to understand who it was you have to go back
[02:24.160 --> 02:31.320]  to another time, when the world was powered by the black fuel, and the deserts sprouted
[02:31.320 --> 02:37.720]  in great cities of pipe and steel, for reasons long forgotten, two mighty warrior tribes
[02:37.720 --> 02:43.400]  went to war, and touched off a blaze which engulfed them all.
[02:43.400 --> 02:50.160]  Without fuel, they were nothing, they built a house of straw, a thundering machine sputtered
[02:50.160 --> 03:00.880]  and stopped their world crumbling, cities exploded, a whirlwind of looting, a firestorm
[03:00.880 --> 03:11.640]  of fear, men began to feed on men, on the roads it was a white line nightmare, only
[03:11.640 --> 03:19.080]  those mobile enough to scavenge, brutal enough to pillage would survive, the gangs took
[03:19.080 --> 03:25.040]  over the highways, ready to wage war for a tank of juice.
[03:25.040 --> 03:32.160]  This diagram right here says it all, and we are here, we are right here with our children,
[03:32.160 --> 03:38.280]  and at a certain level, if the public doesn't wake up and say no to this, it doesn't innovate,
[03:38.280 --> 03:43.560]  and doesn't create a clear vision for ourselves, we kind of deserve what we are having done
[03:43.560 --> 03:46.120]  to us, don't we?
[03:46.120 --> 03:50.920]  Except they're targeting children, and they are trying to get children to give up their
[03:50.920 --> 03:55.480]  humanity, and give up their free will, and basically become sterilized, which is the
[03:55.480 --> 04:02.600]  same thing as killing them under the transgender boat, and imprison them, and take all their
[04:02.600 --> 04:06.920]  hopes and dreams away, and lock them in these digital, metaverse prisons that Zuckerberg
[04:06.920 --> 04:13.240]  just said, he believes that within 15 years, the majority of people will live in the metaverse,
[04:13.240 --> 04:17.600]  well, because you're going to be locked in your house, and if you don't submit and only
[04:17.600 --> 04:25.120]  watch the television, or only watch the iPad, or put the new Google or Apple contacts in,
[04:25.120 --> 04:29.480]  if you don't spend 15 hours a day plugged into their system, you're not going to get
[04:29.480 --> 04:34.400]  the social credit score, you're not going to get the food delivery from the food delivery
[04:34.400 --> 04:40.040]  robot, because they don't want to just kill you, they want to enslave you, and brainwash
[04:40.040 --> 04:47.760]  you, and dumb you down, and make you unnatural, before they incinerate you, and spill your
[04:47.760 --> 04:51.000]  ashes into the atmosphere.
[04:51.000 --> 05:01.840]  You are here, we'll be right back.
[05:01.840 --> 05:08.200]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022, and in the month of February,
[05:08.200 --> 05:14.200]  we had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product, X3, that has all
[05:14.200 --> 05:20.440]  three types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical, cellular
[05:20.440 --> 05:25.960]  activity in your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much, and the
[05:25.960 --> 05:30.760]  majority of the population in the world is iodine deficient, this is the very best iodine
[05:30.760 --> 05:31.760]  out there.
[05:31.760 --> 05:36.280]  So, we had on sale 50% off, but we sold more than half of what we have, or isn't going
[05:36.280 --> 05:40.640]  to come in for a long time, so I took it back to full products, and I was just thinking,
[05:40.640 --> 05:44.760]  you know what, we need the funds in now to stay on air, plus this is the right product
[05:44.760 --> 05:49.560]  everybody needs, so to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get X3
[05:49.560 --> 05:53.920]  and experience it yourself, and support the broadcast, I'm going to keep it at 50% off
[05:53.920 --> 06:17.400]  until it sells out, get X3 right now exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50% off.
[06:17.400 --> 06:25.040]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance, live from the info wars.com
[06:25.040 --> 06:29.480]  studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:29.480 --> 06:37.320]  The forces of transhumanism, the forces of evil, the forces of corporate global fascism
[06:37.320 --> 06:44.680]  using communism as their clowered and pivot operating system have fought like the devil
[06:44.680 --> 06:53.000]  to try to crush and silence this broadcast, but because of us together, myself, this crew,
[06:53.000 --> 07:00.320]  our guests, our callers, you the listeners, and the viewers, because of the community,
[07:00.320 --> 07:08.880]  the system that we have built, we are now stronger than we've ever been.
[07:08.880 --> 07:16.000]  I knew if we could stay on air, at least in the initial phases of their operational attack,
[07:16.000 --> 07:18.360]  it would trigger a chain reaction.
[07:18.360 --> 07:23.160]  We've been in beta for decades, now in the last two years, they've transitioned into
[07:23.160 --> 07:29.920]  launch phase, and just like a ballistic missile or a Saturn rocket going to the moon, when
[07:29.920 --> 07:37.360]  it starts lift off, it's going very slow, and then it exponentially accelerates towards
[07:37.360 --> 07:39.720]  its target.
[07:39.720 --> 07:45.120]  The target is transhumanism, the globalists becoming what they believe is godlike immortality,
[07:45.120 --> 07:51.320]  and of course, exterminating the majority of us on the path to that destiny.
[07:51.320 --> 07:57.360]  The rocket has not even left the gantry, it's moving very slow, and now everybody sees it
[07:57.360 --> 08:03.000]  and understands what it's doing, and we have to collectively expose it and resist it with
[08:03.000 --> 08:08.280]  our will, and it will blow up on the launch pad.
[08:08.280 --> 08:19.320]  There's already cracks, it's already leaking fuel, it's going to blow, and yeah, we're
[08:19.320 --> 08:24.760]  going to get hit by pieces of it, and it's not going to be pretty, but it's going down.
[08:24.760 --> 08:30.880]  You can see the holes in it, you can see the smoke coming out of it, it's about to blow.
[08:30.880 --> 08:34.080]  The question is, will it take all of us with it?
[08:34.080 --> 08:39.960]  They already have primary ignition, lift off has commenced.
[08:39.960 --> 08:45.320]  You are two years into lift off, and in the time and space of politics, it's the winking
[08:45.320 --> 08:48.920]  of an eye.
[08:48.920 --> 08:52.840]  It's going to blow up.
[08:52.840 --> 08:57.680]  The question is, will it get a thousand feet, ten thousand feet in the air, or will it explode
[08:57.680 --> 09:00.160]  any minute now?
[09:00.160 --> 09:05.200]  Right, maximum firepower, the new world order, with the truth, we will bring them down with
[09:05.200 --> 09:10.160]  God's help.
[09:10.160 --> 09:20.080]  Speaking of war, we're now 12 days into the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and Putin always
[09:20.080 --> 09:24.960]  said once he stopped his deception, and maybe a new deception, but he's been following the
[09:24.960 --> 09:29.600]  current line of that deception, so we don't know if he's telling the truth or not, first
[09:29.600 --> 09:34.480]  he said he wasn't going to invade, then he said he was only taking a security zone, now
[09:34.480 --> 09:39.360]  he says he's only taking over parts of the country to force the puppet government, as
[09:39.360 --> 09:44.880]  he calls it, and the Nazi collaborators, which they are actually Nazis, the strongest state
[09:44.880 --> 09:49.040]  behind networks of Nazis anywhere in the world, shut up by the Nazis at the end of World War
[09:49.040 --> 09:54.080]  II, picked up by the CIA after World War II, and it's known as Operation Gladio from there
[09:54.080 --> 09:58.200]  on out in the 1950s.
[09:58.200 --> 10:05.200]  This is the flower of Operation Gladio, but Putin has his share of Nazis working for him
[10:05.200 --> 10:13.400]  as well, like the head of his mercenary task force that's really Spitznet GRU commandos,
[10:13.400 --> 10:22.080]  that's the Wagner group, let's just be honest, Nazism is real sexy in the East, I guess when
[10:22.080 --> 10:29.880]  the Nazis killed 20 million of you, a little bit of Stockholm syndrome going on, but that's
[10:29.880 --> 10:30.880]  what's happening.
[10:30.880 --> 10:36.000]  So when Putin says these are Nazis, the main three brigades that have been overthrowing
[10:36.000 --> 10:41.840]  elected presidents and keeping martial law in place basically are those brigades, and
[10:41.840 --> 10:46.560]  so as soon as those are destroyed, and as soon as they hold another election, Putin has
[10:46.560 --> 10:51.080]  said he's going to pull out, we don't know if that's true, but they had the former Russian
[10:51.080 --> 10:59.480]  backed president who was overthrown by NATO Soros forces, just Soros Bragg's the overthrowing,
[10:59.480 --> 11:06.960]  quote, set up the Soros Empire, close quote, he had just left Moscow and flew into Eastern
[11:06.960 --> 11:13.000]  Ukraine to begin talks to be the intermediate president while they hold new elections.
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.880]  That's all in the Russian and Ukrainian news, you're not seeing it in the US news, but it's
[11:16.880 --> 11:19.120]  in my stack.
[11:19.120 --> 11:27.200]  So let's hit the latest headlines on Ukraine and what's going on in the economy, then we're
[11:27.200 --> 11:37.760]  going to come back and really cover the most naked assault on the people of the world I
[11:37.760 --> 11:39.960]  have ever seen.
[11:39.960 --> 11:46.720]  If you think phase one of the launch phase, COVID-19 was bad, the artificial cutting off
[11:46.720 --> 11:52.560]  of the world energy supply is a death sentence to hundreds of millions, and it is a poverty
[11:52.560 --> 11:58.440]  sentence for another billion people or so, and that's in the numbers, we'll cover that
[11:58.440 --> 12:06.560]  next segment, but the spectacle of Biden publicly asking Saudi Arabia to increase output, publicly
[12:06.560 --> 12:14.920]  asking Venezuela to increase output, publicly asking Russia to increase output, and then
[12:14.920 --> 12:19.480]  blocking all new oil leases on public land and most of the other leases and shutting
[12:19.480 --> 12:27.200]  down several thousand pipeline spurs, including the Keystone pipeline, I mean, a foreign army
[12:27.200 --> 12:33.920]  couldn't shut our power off like this, this is just absolutely out of control, so that's
[12:33.920 --> 12:39.040]  coming up next segment, there's some of the big headlines right now, we're going to drill
[12:39.040 --> 12:42.200]  through these, these are just incredible.
[12:42.200 --> 12:45.120]  None of these articles, we can do the whole four hours on them, we don't have the time,
[12:45.120 --> 12:48.440]  so I'm going to condense all this, okay?
[12:48.440 --> 12:55.440]  Polish top diplomat, no fly zone in Ukraine, likely illegal would trigger major war, oh
[12:55.440 --> 13:00.280]  is that a Russian sympathizer, no the Poles really don't like Russians, in fact they hate
[13:00.280 --> 13:05.960]  each other because of thousands of years of fighting back and forth, and they're saying
[13:05.960 --> 13:09.320]  no we're not giving them planes, and no we don't want to go to war with Russia, and
[13:09.320 --> 13:15.120]  no, they have the State Department is lying when he says we are.
[13:15.120 --> 13:19.280]  Ukraine Ministry of Defense accuses Ukraine of planting nuclear false flag, I mean we
[13:19.280 --> 13:23.160]  know the media said that they blew up all those reactors, they're two different nuclear
[13:23.160 --> 13:29.760]  reactors, and it was all lies, just like the ghost of Kiev and Snake Island and Golinsky
[13:29.760 --> 13:33.640]  saying I don't want to ride out of here, I want weapons, that was all made up they now
[13:33.640 --> 13:39.640]  admit, even the Washington Post just all lies, but it gets you emotionally to pick a side,
[13:39.640 --> 13:45.680]  because the average American who's asleep still wants to go with their emotions, instead
[13:45.680 --> 13:52.640]  of getting mad that you got conned, you just still stay mad.
[13:52.640 --> 13:57.520]  Russia accuses Ukraine of prepping nuclear false flag, says they seized nuclear facilities
[13:57.520 --> 14:02.720]  where dirty bombs were being prepared, Russian Ministry of Defense accuses Ukraine of planting
[14:02.720 --> 14:09.160]  nuclear false flag, will be covering that bottom of the hour, also Trump jokes US should bomb
[14:09.160 --> 14:15.600]  the SH-T out of Russia and blame China, isn't it funny we've gone from false flags, never
[14:15.600 --> 14:20.600]  happened in history, Alex Jones is insane for popularizing the ancient term, terms at
[14:20.600 --> 14:26.280]  least a thousand years old, where it comes from, is back in the Norse Wars, where you
[14:26.280 --> 14:30.240]  first see that in English used, it's a thousand year old term, but others had it before it
[14:30.240 --> 14:34.080]  was called a false flag, just means flying a flag of your enemy to go commit an atrocity
[14:34.080 --> 14:40.200]  is the most common one, you know attacking people in disguise, and Sean Hannity called
[14:40.200 --> 14:46.360]  for a false flag, said have our planes, houses in other country and then bomb the convoy
[14:46.360 --> 14:50.040]  of Russians, and of course anybody with actual military training would tell you that they'd
[14:50.040 --> 14:54.400]  figure that out very quickly, but see they wanted Americans so in the dark the deep
[14:54.400 --> 14:58.480]  steaked it, oh there's no such thing as a false flag, don't question Jesse Smollett
[14:58.480 --> 15:02.600]  and you know don't question the Gulf of Tonkin and don't question mass shootings, no no no
[15:02.600 --> 15:08.880]  you never question, that's the ultimate crime, let us just do whatever we want, manipulate
[15:08.880 --> 15:15.480]  whatever we want, and now Trump is speaking to a group of donors, and he says hey, why
[15:15.480 --> 15:20.760]  don't we just stage a false flag as a joke, to bomb the Russians saying it was the Chinese,
[15:20.760 --> 15:25.160]  well obviously they'd figure that out plus it's immoral, but he's being tongue in cheek,
[15:25.160 --> 15:30.720]  US Congress to explore Russian oil ban, which Putin says is an act of war, and 10 billion
[15:30.720 --> 15:35.120]  in aid for Ukraine, that means 10 billion to all the members of Congress who have their
[15:35.120 --> 15:40.200]  own companies set up there, goes directly to them.
[15:40.200 --> 15:44.680]  Trends forecaster and major insurance companies and banks all agree a 10% chance of total
[15:44.680 --> 15:49.200]  civilization ending nuclear war within a year, we'll be covering that bottom of the hour,
[15:49.200 --> 15:54.120]  but first the war we know is going on, the shutdown of western energy, particularly targeting
[15:54.120 --> 15:56.120]  the United States of America.
[16:25.120 --> 16:30.520]  So again, both these products are back in stock, both X3 and Winter Sun, they are 50%
[16:30.520 --> 16:36.120]  off for a limited time because they're going to sell out at this price, I would estimate
[16:36.120 --> 16:41.000]  in less than a month, so this is your chance to get X3 and experience the good halogens
[16:41.000 --> 16:45.200]  versus the bad halogens, this is your chance to have the highest quality vitamin D3 with
[16:45.200 --> 16:50.040]  vitamin K for your muses as well, they're amazing and they're an infowarstore.com, and
[16:50.040 --> 16:55.760]  the reason this is a 360 win is it funds the operation, I need funds to run the operation,
[16:55.760 --> 16:59.480]  you need to be healthy, we need to stay on air, it's a match made in heaven.
[16:59.480 --> 17:06.080]  It has been noted by many a historian, the first casualty of war is the truth, and the
[17:06.080 --> 17:13.240]  next big casualty isn't even the people that die, no that invariably follows, but first
[17:13.240 --> 17:21.080]  there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty, and speech, and massive censorship,
[17:21.080 --> 17:26.720]  and now across the world, from the United States to Europe, legislation is being introduced
[17:26.720 --> 17:35.400]  that if you amplify any quote pro-Russian information, you can be censored, you can
[17:35.400 --> 17:40.760]  be arrested, you can be imprisoned, and of course now Canada's introduced legislation
[17:40.760 --> 17:46.880]  that if you have a thought crime, and they think you may have the intent to engage in
[17:46.880 --> 17:52.720]  hate speech online, that you will be censored and arrested, ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism
[17:52.720 --> 17:57.880]  is being carried out by the globalists around the world against humanity that makes infowars.com
[17:57.880 --> 17:59.840]  more important than ever.
[17:59.840 --> 18:05.360]  It's time to protect your privacy, it's time to come to grips with the fact that even though
[18:05.360 --> 18:10.760]  you don't have anything to hide, criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government
[18:10.760 --> 18:15.880]  are stealing all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go and what
[18:15.880 --> 18:21.600]  you do, so in the future under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[18:21.600 --> 18:25.800]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting
[18:25.800 --> 18:30.440]  your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount, that's why everybody
[18:30.440 --> 18:36.200]  should visit infowarsstore.com, we're carrying a huge new line of very compliant, made in

[18:42.680 --> 18:48.160]  your privacy and shop at infowars to support the overall info war against the globalists,
[18:48.160 --> 18:50.200]  a true 360 win.
[18:50.200 --> 18:59.880]  Get your Faraday cages at infowarsstore.com, check out the new line, it's amazing.
[18:59.880 --> 19:05.920]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons
[19:05.920 --> 19:10.400]  and chemicals added to the food, it's all come out and they're doing that not because
[19:10.400 --> 19:15.960]  we're weak but because we're made the image of God, the creator and we are powerful and
[19:15.960 --> 19:21.200]  the social engineers fear that so much, so that's why I repeat that famous internet saying
[19:21.200 --> 19:26.800]  that nobody knows who first came up with the boy, is it true?
[19:26.800 --> 19:33.160]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless, they need all their
[19:33.160 --> 19:38.840]  propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because
[19:38.840 --> 19:44.080]  they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on to God of this world who
[19:44.080 --> 19:48.160]  is a loser and that's why it's so important that everybody keep info wars in the air now
[19:48.160 --> 19:52.840]  more than ever because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting
[19:52.840 --> 19:57.760]  in setting up is Satanic and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the
[19:57.760 --> 20:01.280]  beast they just announced.
[20:01.280 --> 20:24.360]  Including a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:24.360 --> 20:28.600]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show, very honored that you have joined us today.
[20:28.600 --> 20:36.720]  We have some huge guests joining us in the third and fourth hour, I'll tell you about
[20:36.720 --> 20:43.240]  those guests coming up the next segment but I need to get into the energy situation.
[20:43.240 --> 20:48.360]  So as I told you two years ago, phase one is to release the virus, lock down society,
[20:48.360 --> 20:53.600]  destroy supply chains, introduce the idea of a global digital ID as a vaccine passport
[20:53.600 --> 20:58.400]  so they can then have a war and cyber attacks and then bring down the world currency and
[20:58.400 --> 21:04.520]  blame COVID and the war for it but offer everyone a universal basic income to survive on the
[21:04.520 --> 21:08.600]  new digital currency as the other currencies fail.
[21:08.600 --> 21:13.680]  And then with that new system, they'll track, trace and control everything you do and apply
[21:13.680 --> 21:15.560]  carbon taxes and the social credit score.
[21:15.560 --> 21:19.320]  This has all been announced by the Davos group and the UN and GGP.
[21:19.320 --> 21:22.240]  People are like freaking out everywhere going, there are no singing on the news what Jones
[21:22.240 --> 21:25.720]  said years ago, he's psychic or he's one of them.
[21:25.720 --> 21:27.120]  No, it's all planned.
[21:27.120 --> 21:28.960]  I have their documents here today.
[21:28.960 --> 21:29.960]  I repulled.
[21:29.960 --> 21:36.320]  It's like you get the enemy playbook in football or something and they tell you what plays
[21:36.320 --> 21:37.320]  they're going to play.
[21:37.320 --> 21:40.520]  I mean, we have the damn playbook.
[21:40.520 --> 21:44.840]  So all of this is rolling out, all of this is being done and they admit they're quote
[21:44.840 --> 21:51.120]  creating a transition of the people of the world into working from home, into having
[21:51.120 --> 21:56.040]  no money, into being obsolete, into being non-essential and you're told, oh, it's about to be a utopia
[21:56.040 --> 21:57.880]  but you notice it's not a utopia.
[21:57.880 --> 22:04.760]  The deeper we get into this, stars the third world to death, impoverishes us on our road
[22:04.760 --> 22:09.560]  to starvation and death finally, but it's all done incrementally.
[22:09.560 --> 22:14.080]  And so what's more obvious than cooking up a virus and releasing it and then using it
[22:14.080 --> 22:16.920]  as the pretext to shut down society?
[22:16.920 --> 22:20.480]  What is even more obvious?
[22:20.480 --> 22:25.000]  Shutting down over 2,000 mini pipelines and spurs, hundreds of large pipelines including
[22:25.000 --> 22:30.920]  the mega massive Keystone pipeline right as it was completed.
[22:30.920 --> 22:34.720]  And then of course it gets a lot worse from that point out.
[22:34.720 --> 22:39.800]  You then say no drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, you then put in regulations over who is drilling
[22:39.800 --> 22:41.920]  in the U.S.
[22:41.920 --> 22:47.760]  But then you let all these other countries like Venezuela and Saudi Arabia and Russia
[22:47.760 --> 22:52.560]  increase their output to the United States at much higher prices and then the globalist
[22:52.560 --> 22:59.040]  middlemen get that money and you pay already double what you were 13, 14 months ago.
[22:59.040 --> 23:02.400]  And it's set to double again at current rates in the next six months.
[23:02.400 --> 23:05.120]  Yeah, you're going to be paying six bucks a gallon.
[23:05.120 --> 23:09.920]  They already are in areas of California, over $4 nationally.
[23:09.920 --> 23:13.720]  And the environmental groups won't let any new refineries be built in the U.S.
[23:13.720 --> 23:19.960]  You have been strangled and that's how they get you on your knees, that's how they take
[23:19.960 --> 23:20.960]  full control.
[23:20.960 --> 23:29.920]  And the good news is Adam Karola gets it, great inventor of podcasting, fellow Austinite,
[23:29.920 --> 23:34.960]  Glenn Beck gets it, Senator Paul gets it, Senator Cruz gets it, we get it.
[23:34.960 --> 23:40.280]  And so imagine we're supposedly at war with Russia through the proxy of Ukraine, but Biden
[23:40.280 --> 23:46.120]  is not cutting off Russian oil, which I don't think he should do, it's an act of war.
[23:46.120 --> 23:51.120]  But they're talking about increasing the oil while we can't have the oil and socky and
[23:51.120 --> 23:55.840]  all of them say, oh, it's all because of Putin, your gas prices went up, when that only added
[23:55.840 --> 24:00.800]  the cherry on top of it going up 30, 40 cents the last month or last three weeks.
[24:00.800 --> 24:04.800]  So let's go to clip eight first, we'll take a little bit of the next segment to finish
[24:04.800 --> 24:05.800]  these clips.
[24:05.800 --> 24:12.720]  But here's Adam Curry, call him Adam Karola, Adam Curry.
[24:12.720 --> 24:16.880]  Here's Adam Curry, the great inventor of podcasting or the first kind of podcast here in Austin,
[24:16.880 --> 24:21.480]  Texas, on Glenn Beck, here it is.
[24:21.480 --> 24:23.560]  We're hitting back with what?
[24:23.560 --> 24:24.560]  Financial weapons.
[24:24.560 --> 24:25.560]  Why?
[24:25.560 --> 24:27.120]  Why are we using financial weapons?
[24:27.120 --> 24:31.720]  I believe this is it, Glenn, I believe this is never let a crisis go to waste.
[24:31.720 --> 24:37.560]  This is the tipping point, we need to price energy so high, because that's the effect.
[24:37.560 --> 24:38.560]  That's the effect.
[24:38.560 --> 24:44.560]  Energy is going to be so high, and we can talk about Swift in a minute, when you change
[24:44.560 --> 24:49.960]  something in a system, in a network like that, I know enough from technology that one small
[24:49.960 --> 24:54.840]  change, that can screw up a lot of things, already wheat prices are now as high as Arab
[24:54.840 --> 25:00.160]  spring days, so it's going to be really, really, really hard times, and I think that
[25:00.160 --> 25:06.600]  the idea is to shut down global production because of the cost of energy no one's going
[25:06.600 --> 25:11.640]  to want to produce, go back home, sit at home, don't worry, we'll take care of you just
[25:11.640 --> 25:13.680]  like COVID, we're going to send you money.
[25:13.680 --> 25:20.000]  This time, though, not a check, this time it's your Federal Reserve digital dollar,
[25:20.000 --> 25:25.240]  and then we're in deep trouble, and I don't think that's stoppable, I think that is unstoppable
[25:25.240 --> 25:26.240]  at this point.
[25:26.240 --> 25:31.040]  But I'm a doomer optimist, so I have ideas and solutions, I have ideas.
[25:31.040 --> 25:34.760]  I am an optimistic catastrophist.
[25:34.760 --> 25:40.480]  I'm also a conspiracy therapist, so yes, I have a number of phrases.
[25:40.480 --> 25:44.400]  That's Adam Curry, the war in Ukraine fast tracks the Great Reset.
[25:44.400 --> 25:52.520]  Now, let's go back, what, two, three years ago, to President Trump, and this is President
[25:52.520 --> 25:58.920]  Trump talking about how America's being set up, and so is Europe and others, to be vulnerable,
[25:58.920 --> 26:03.480]  and the fact that Germany's basically laughing at us, here it is.
[26:03.480 --> 26:10.600]  Reliance on a single foreign supplier can leave a nation vulnerable to extortion and
[26:10.600 --> 26:12.360]  intimidation.
[26:12.360 --> 26:19.680]  That is why we congratulate European states such as Poland for leading the construction
[26:19.680 --> 26:27.920]  of a Baltic pipeline so that nations are not dependent on Russia to meet their energy needs.
[26:27.920 --> 26:38.040]  Energy will become totally dependent on Russian energy if it does not immediately change course.
[26:38.040 --> 26:47.040]  Here in the Western Hemisphere, we are committed to maintaining our independence from the encroachment
[26:47.040 --> 26:51.400]  of expatriates, foreign powers.
[26:51.400 --> 26:56.680]  And the Germans laughed at him for that, if your radio listener can't see that video.
[26:56.680 --> 27:00.880]  Now what, oh, I forgot, what did Biden just do last month, too?
[27:00.880 --> 27:06.360]  He killed, I don't know how the U.S. has this power, but we're the globalist empire now.
[27:06.360 --> 27:16.160]  He killed the Israeli-Arab-backed gas pipeline out of the Mediterranean, out of the Middle
[27:16.160 --> 27:20.840]  East, into Europe as well by passing Russia.
[27:20.840 --> 27:32.560]  So they're cutting off everything, except Venezuela, except Saudi Arabia, except Russia.
[27:32.560 --> 27:38.520]  While telling us Russia is the big enemy, and we've all got to go to war with them.
[27:38.520 --> 27:39.520]  Think about that.
[27:39.520 --> 27:42.240]  I've got a couple more clips on the energy front.
[27:42.240 --> 27:48.040]  When we come back, this is a big, big deal.
[27:48.040 --> 27:52.560]  So the judge says buying oil from Iran is on the table.
[27:52.560 --> 27:57.960]  They're increasing production out of Venezuela, so the U.S. diplomats down there.
[27:57.960 --> 28:04.320]  But again, you can't have the keystone pipeline that's finished and ready to lower our prices,
[28:04.320 --> 28:06.800]  to even lower levels than when Trump was in.
[28:06.800 --> 28:12.520]  Trump gave that speech three years ago to the United Nations on globalism, and how globalism
[28:12.520 --> 28:14.560]  was bad, and how the New World Order was evil.
[28:14.560 --> 28:19.960]  He said that in that speech, credible speech, and he pointed out that the globalists want
[28:19.960 --> 28:25.520]  to make America energy dependent, when at that time we were the world's top exporter
[28:25.520 --> 28:27.560]  and producer of energy.
[28:27.560 --> 28:34.520]  Now we can't even produce 80% of what we need, and they want to make it worse, and we have
[28:34.520 --> 28:35.600]  rolling blackouts.
[28:35.600 --> 28:40.760]  We are being shut down so that we cannot be competitive with India and China and Mexico
[28:40.760 --> 28:45.640]  and 100-plus other third-world countries that have no environmental standards and no rules
[28:45.640 --> 28:48.280]  and are building unlimited coal power plants.
[28:48.280 --> 28:50.060]  This is how you destroy a nation.
[28:50.060 --> 28:51.680]  This is how you bankrupt people.
[28:51.680 --> 28:53.320]  This is how you bring us to heel.
[28:53.320 --> 28:55.040]  This is how you clout and pivot.
[28:55.040 --> 29:01.040]  This is the great reset.
[29:01.040 --> 29:05.440]  Alex Jones here with a very simple proposal for all our great and full-worth listeners
[29:05.440 --> 29:06.440]  and viewers.
[29:06.440 --> 29:12.640]  If you will simply get X3 with all three types of good iodine that boosts your immune system
[29:12.640 --> 29:17.240]  and help everything that goes on your body at the cellular level, it will change your
[29:17.240 --> 29:18.240]  life.
[29:18.240 --> 29:19.240]  It will invigorate you.
[29:19.240 --> 29:20.240]  It will empower you.
[29:20.240 --> 29:23.240]  Almost everyone has iodine deficiency.
[29:23.240 --> 29:24.760]  Look into it for yourself.
[29:24.760 --> 29:26.240]  It's the opposite of fluoride.
[29:26.240 --> 29:31.800]  It's the good, halogen, and then your purchase of X3 funds our operation.
[29:31.800 --> 29:36.000]  Now a lot of our products have been sold out and never came back in because of the lockdowns
[29:36.000 --> 29:37.000]  and supply chain breakouts.
[29:37.000 --> 29:41.800]  We were sold out of X3 for a long time and I had it on sale for 50% off and a lot of
[29:41.800 --> 29:42.800]  folks have been getting it.
[29:42.800 --> 29:46.520]  And I was thinking, you know what, I'm going to bring it back on sale again just until
[29:46.520 --> 29:50.280]  it sells out because even though we won't make as much money in the long run, a lot
[29:50.280 --> 29:54.280]  of folks need this product and we need to get the money from the sales end down to stay
[29:54.280 --> 29:55.280]  on air.
[29:55.280 --> 29:59.280]  See your X3 right now at 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[29:59.280 --> 30:01.800]  So I did it.
[30:01.800 --> 30:03.960]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[30:03.960 --> 30:08.640]  I've been training probably not as much as they should be, but thank goodness for prayer
[30:08.640 --> 30:11.640]  and thank goodness for infowarstore.com.
[30:11.640 --> 30:16.720]  Before I start out on a run, I throw down some Turbo Force to give me that energy I need
[30:16.720 --> 30:17.720]  to get going.
[30:17.720 --> 30:22.560]  You know, besides the energy, Turbo Force, it is giving me the vitamins I need like vitamin
[30:22.560 --> 30:28.200]  C to keep me healthy and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids for sustained energy
[30:28.200 --> 30:31.000]  giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[30:31.000 --> 30:34.640]  And then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones' Sorilis.
[30:34.640 --> 30:36.960]  I have bad joints, thanks mom.
[30:36.960 --> 30:41.640]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now plus inflammation
[30:41.640 --> 30:44.040]  support and extra flexibility.
[30:44.040 --> 30:48.600]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[30:48.600 --> 30:53.280]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news, Turbo Force, that can
[30:53.280 --> 30:57.360]  still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day and Sorilis can keep you
[30:57.360 --> 31:00.760]  moving and feeling great at any age.
[31:00.760 --> 31:06.160]  I stay on air selling high quality products that you need, that you want and that you're
[31:06.160 --> 31:07.560]  going to be happy with.
[31:07.560 --> 31:10.440]  That's why you come back and buy products from me again.
[31:10.440 --> 31:12.160]  It's a symbiotic relationship.
[31:12.160 --> 31:16.760]  I promote liberty, I promote freedom, I fight the globalist and I'm able to do that because
[31:16.760 --> 31:19.200]  you buy products at infowarstore.com.
[31:19.200 --> 31:23.440]  And listen, all the products are great but when it comes to high quality storeable food
[31:23.440 --> 31:29.880]  in an inflationary system with major supply chain breakdowns, this is an absolute 360
[31:29.880 --> 31:34.280]  and a no brainer and they've got high quality storeable food ready to ship to you right
[31:34.280 --> 31:35.280]  now.
[31:35.280 --> 31:39.800]  The great folks at my patron supply exclusively prepare with Alex.com discounted.
[31:39.800 --> 31:44.400]  So again, be in inflation, be prepared, fund the info war, the only way you lose is not
[31:44.400 --> 31:49.800]  taking action at infowarstore.com or prepare with Alex.com right now.
[31:49.800 --> 31:54.240]  This is high quality storeable food, this is how you beat inflation, get yours today,
[31:54.240 --> 31:58.280]  it's ready to ship but I wouldn't wait because prices are about to go up because inflation
[31:58.280 --> 32:00.000]  is exploding.
[32:00.000 --> 32:07.440]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[32:07.440 --> 32:10.640]  until the populations rebelled.
[32:10.640 --> 32:16.160]  They would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting
[32:16.160 --> 32:19.040]  anybody that speaks out against their laws.
[32:19.040 --> 32:24.600]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and
[32:24.600 --> 32:30.320]  whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware
[32:30.320 --> 32:36.760]  that it is a world government corporate takeover and so it's pulling back the curtain now more
[32:36.760 --> 32:37.760]  than ever.
[32:37.760 --> 32:42.280]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[32:42.280 --> 32:48.640]  Like Canada, they've now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario and other
[32:48.640 --> 32:51.000]  areas of the world are following suit like Australia.
[32:51.000 --> 32:55.800]  So pray for these folks big time, this is a very serious situation and stay tuned into
[32:55.800 --> 33:01.720]  infowars.com because truth is absolutely paramount.
[33:01.720 --> 33:15.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:15.000 --> 33:22.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:22.000 --> 33:31.000]  I'm just an average man with an average life, I work from 9 to 5, hell I pay the price,
[33:31.000 --> 33:34.000]  all I want is to be left alone in my average home.
[33:34.000 --> 33:43.000]  But why do I always feel like I'm in the twilight zone and I always feel like somebody's watching
[33:43.000 --> 33:46.000]  me.
[33:46.000 --> 33:49.480]  I'm your host Alex Jones, very thankful that you tune in, very thankful that you care about
[33:49.480 --> 33:55.120]  our world, very thankful you realize that we the people have the power to stop the global
[33:55.120 --> 33:56.120]  transhumanist cult.
[33:56.120 --> 34:00.000]  But we have to wake up to the full horror of it, admit we're in trouble and then organize
[34:00.000 --> 34:04.000]  against it and then our job will be very, very easy.
[34:04.000 --> 34:05.440]  And that's not hype.
[34:05.440 --> 34:12.520]  I am attacked conservatively hundreds of times a day in global corporate press, millions
[34:12.520 --> 34:19.760]  of times a day on different social media networks and they see me as the number two enemy of
[34:19.760 --> 34:21.120]  their globalist operations.
[34:21.120 --> 34:25.800]  They see Trump as the number one enemy because he openly publicly opposed him, doesn't mean
[34:25.800 --> 34:28.800]  a perfect job, neither have I.
[34:28.800 --> 34:35.640]  They see yours truly as enemy number two because I accurately analyze who they are and effectively
[34:35.640 --> 34:37.880]  reach millions of people because of your word of mouth.
[34:37.880 --> 34:43.520]  And then they see Tucker Carlson as number three, the biggest threat and Joe Rogan number
[34:43.520 --> 34:45.680]  four as the biggest threat.
[34:45.680 --> 34:49.320]  And believe me, I'm not up here wanting to be number one on the hit list.
[34:49.320 --> 34:57.240]  I'm very excited to see so many people like Adam Curry and Glenn Beck waking up because
[34:57.240 --> 35:01.320]  they're both smart men and that is a very good thing because the minute we wake up that
[35:01.320 --> 35:06.240]  we're under corporate global 21st century siege and deindustrialization and post-industrial
[35:06.240 --> 35:11.120]  world in a controlled global collapse called the Great Reset and on its ashes build the
[35:11.120 --> 35:14.960]  build back better technocracy.
[35:14.960 --> 35:19.840]  Once people realize that things only get worse complying, things only get better resisting,
[35:19.840 --> 35:24.720]  then we start winning.
[35:24.720 --> 35:29.760]  And we should be celebrating the devastating victories we've been having against the globalist
[35:29.760 --> 35:31.520]  when it comes to their whole COVID power grab.
[35:31.520 --> 35:36.000]  They have been incredible.
[35:36.000 --> 35:38.400]  That's why they're trying to get off the COVID narrative for now.
[35:38.400 --> 35:40.520]  They're going to bring it back with new viruses.
[35:40.520 --> 35:45.240]  They've said they are and move us into war in other areas, but we've got to continue
[35:45.240 --> 35:50.720]  to hammer that in next hour.
[35:50.720 --> 35:54.520]  I know Joe's going to do something on this because he sent it to me.
[35:54.520 --> 35:59.720]  And I said, I said, man, this is incredible after I spent two hours Saturday reading what
[35:59.720 --> 36:02.680]  he sent me.
[36:02.680 --> 36:04.160]  And I said, man, you got to do a show on this.
[36:04.160 --> 36:06.160]  He says, oh, I'm going to do one.
[36:06.160 --> 36:12.120]  So little heads up, you'll have his own version of this and this is a link he sent me.
[36:12.120 --> 36:15.120]  And I almost don't want to talk about the link on Twitter that's got millions of people
[36:15.120 --> 36:17.960]  reading it because the enemy will go delete it.
[36:17.960 --> 36:21.160]  But you see this stack right here?
[36:21.160 --> 36:28.760]  I've read this whole thing once and I've gone back over it partially this morning.
[36:28.760 --> 36:34.560]  I'm going to spend the entire second hour on this baby right here because they don't
[36:34.560 --> 36:35.560]  want us looking at this.
[36:35.560 --> 36:37.760]  You know what this is?
[36:37.760 --> 36:42.080]  You know what this is?
[36:42.080 --> 36:48.120]  This is just the surface of what they did to us in the most evil psychological warfare,
[36:48.120 --> 36:50.960]  biological attack in human history.
[36:50.960 --> 36:54.120]  MKUltra on steroids.
[36:54.120 --> 37:01.520]  This is the whole COVID power grab, the whole COVID hysteria, the whole COVID takeover.
[37:01.520 --> 37:06.400]  And I had forgotten so much of the stuff they pulled, so much of the stuff they did.
[37:06.400 --> 37:12.400]  And one individual on Twitter collated this.
[37:12.400 --> 37:16.160]  So I asked the great Kelly McBreen yesterday, I called him and I said, well, you write an
[37:16.160 --> 37:21.560]  article about this today on infowars.com.
[37:21.560 --> 37:25.840]  Well, you put some links to this so folks can find it and share it.
[37:25.840 --> 37:30.240]  And I would suggest everybody go there and look at all these and create your own Twitter
[37:30.240 --> 37:35.120]  or Instagram or Facebook feeds or getter feeds or gab feeds.
[37:35.120 --> 37:39.440]  It's always good to attack the enemy on their main platforms with the truth, but then build
[37:39.440 --> 37:44.920]  your backup system so they ban you over there.
[37:44.920 --> 37:49.480]  But the reason I don't get a lot of attention to activists online is when we do give attention,
[37:49.480 --> 37:55.000]  the enemy comes in and takes it down, but this is too important.
[37:55.000 --> 37:59.160]  The globalists want everyone to forget what was done in the name of COVID.
[37:59.160 --> 38:14.600]  The greatest illegal psychological experiment of lethal proportions in human history.
[38:14.600 --> 38:21.440]  So next hour, I'm spending a whole hour and we're going to go through this.
[38:21.440 --> 38:34.440]  And what's insane is when this individual, Sir Thadwick Holton, posted his long breakdown.
[38:34.440 --> 38:35.440]  Everybody else started adding to it.
[38:35.440 --> 38:39.960]  So now it's thousands of tweets long and that people dug up even worse stuff.
[38:39.960 --> 38:42.040]  But listen to this.
[38:42.040 --> 38:47.320]  Now that COVID's over, here is a thread of everything they want you to forget.
[38:47.320 --> 38:50.240]  We're going to be doing that next hour.
[38:50.240 --> 38:53.120]  Believe me, you don't want to miss this information.
[38:53.120 --> 38:57.920]  And you got to share it with everybody so people realize the trauma we've all been through
[38:57.920 --> 39:00.600]  because here's the deal.
[39:00.600 --> 39:09.560]  As successful people, as folks that don't see adversity as something to give up to but
[39:09.560 --> 39:13.880]  it's something to overcome, we get hurt, we get wounded, they kill members of our family,
[39:13.880 --> 39:19.920]  they demonize us, they attack us, they try to bankrupt us.
[39:19.920 --> 39:22.280]  And we don't give up, we fight back.
[39:22.280 --> 39:25.520]  And we tend to also compartmentalize and forget what was done to us.
[39:25.520 --> 39:29.120]  It's very important to point out what these criminals did and the criminal behavioral
[39:29.120 --> 39:33.480]  psychology operations they launched and to point it out to everybody so they can't get
[39:33.480 --> 39:39.520]  away with it again bare minimum and so we can also bring them to justice, which is going
[39:39.520 --> 39:43.680]  to be happening.
[39:43.680 --> 39:52.080]  And let me tell you what's coming up in the third hour today.
[39:52.080 --> 40:01.240]  Emerald Robinson, who's an amazing journalist and news anchor, is a whistleblower from Newsmax
[40:01.240 --> 40:05.360]  and of course Newsmax was on the list of four-year documents released that the blaze got last
[40:05.360 --> 40:11.720]  week of over a billion dollars paid to mainstream media, including Fox News and Newsmax, but
[40:11.720 --> 40:18.800]  ABC, NBC, all of them, CNN, over a billion dollars to not have any negative coverage
[40:18.800 --> 40:24.800]  of the deadly vaccines, literally paying them to help cover up the crimes.
[40:24.800 --> 40:32.000]  Smoking gun, of smoking gun, of smoking gun, of true criminal racketeering, but they own
[40:32.000 --> 40:35.440]  the FBI and the Justice Department so they'll probably give them presidential medals of
[40:35.440 --> 40:39.360]  freedom for killing our children and our old people.
[40:39.360 --> 40:46.840]  40% increase in deaths everywhere where the shots have been given, in 18 to 64 insurance
[40:46.840 --> 40:51.600]  companies report it is the shot, funeral directors report, record numbers of deaths, blood clots
[40:51.600 --> 40:56.960]  in people that have been injected, they've actually run a bio attack as a beta test to
[40:56.960 --> 40:57.960]  see how we would respond.
[40:57.960 --> 41:00.840]  Can you imagine when they dropped the real hammer on us?
[41:00.840 --> 41:06.360]  That is coming up with Emerald Robinson and then Roger Stone has been hanging out a lot
[41:06.360 --> 41:11.000]  with Trump a lot and he's got all the big inside baseball, he's not going to give out
[41:11.000 --> 41:16.320]  any Trump secrets, but you want to know 2022, 2024, a lot of big news, what the globalists
[41:16.320 --> 41:22.320]  are planning, what the inside baseball Rogers got, he'll be joining us in the fourth hour
[41:22.320 --> 41:23.320]  that I'm hosting today.
[41:23.320 --> 41:28.720]  Okay, I need to come back next segment and finish up on energy, get into the latest with
[41:28.720 --> 41:32.360]  the false flag the Russians say that they caught the Ukrainians trying to engage in
[41:32.360 --> 41:35.680]  with a giant dirty bomb and so much more.
[41:35.680 --> 41:40.840]  Let me just say now to listeners that I appreciate you all keeping us on air, but now more than
[41:40.840 --> 41:45.640]  ever I'm firing the bat signal and letting you know that we need money to stay on air
[41:45.640 --> 41:52.200]  and to defeat these Democratic Party lawsuits and to at least by time and to continue to
[41:52.200 --> 41:53.720]  fight on.
[41:53.720 --> 41:58.400]  Same folks, bankrupted Remington, you name it, same folks destroyed the NRA and crippled
[41:58.400 --> 41:59.400]  them.
[41:59.400 --> 42:03.120]  Well, they haven't crippled us because of you, but I need you to go to m4warstore.com right
[42:03.120 --> 42:09.200]  now and get products you already need amazing books, films, water filtration, air filtration,
[42:09.200 --> 42:14.440]  high quality, swarble food ready to ship and incredible products like X3, all three types
[42:14.440 --> 42:20.760]  of the good clean iodine, including deep crystal iodine that is the purest out there for 50%
[42:20.760 --> 42:21.760]  off.
[42:21.760 --> 42:24.640]  Even though we're going to sell out and I ended the sale a week ago, I decided with
[42:24.640 --> 42:28.640]  all the runs on iodine to not have it go to full price like I normally would do when
[42:28.640 --> 42:30.120]  it's close to selling out.
[42:30.120 --> 42:35.320]  No, 50% off until it sells out because you need it for your immune system, your body
[42:35.320 --> 42:37.040]  and for everything.
[42:37.040 --> 42:41.840]  But look into iodine, deficiency, it's a scourge on the planet, especially in children.
[42:41.840 --> 42:43.880]  Look into it and support the broadcast.
[42:43.880 --> 42:48.600]  Order your X3 now at m4warstore.com.
[42:48.600 --> 42:51.680]  Also winner son, high quality vitamin D3.
[42:51.680 --> 42:54.200]  It's 50% off as well.
[42:54.200 --> 42:55.200]  Stay well.
[42:55.200 --> 43:06.400]  Two of our best selling products are back in stock at m4warstore.com and they will sell
[43:06.400 --> 43:09.840]  out in the next three, four months before I get more of the product in if I sell it
[43:09.840 --> 43:10.840]  at full price.
[43:10.840 --> 43:15.520]  But I want those of you that have been on the fence about getting one or son or getting
[43:15.520 --> 43:21.560]  X3 to try the products and see how amazing they are and I believe you will then get
[43:21.560 --> 43:25.280]  hooked on them like myself and my family and the crew are.
[43:25.280 --> 43:30.880]  So again, both these products are back in stock, both X3 and winner son, they are 50%
[43:30.880 --> 43:36.440]  off for a limited time because they're going to sell out at this price I would estimate
[43:36.440 --> 43:38.160]  in less than a month.
[43:38.160 --> 43:42.280]  So this is your chance to get X3 and experience the good halogens versus the bad halogens.
[43:42.280 --> 43:46.800]  This is your chance to have the highest quality vitamin D3 with vitamin K for your immune
[43:46.800 --> 43:47.800]  system as well.
[43:47.800 --> 43:49.800]  They're amazing and they're at m4warstore.com.
[43:49.800 --> 43:54.200]  And the reason this is a 360 win is it funds the operation.
[43:54.200 --> 43:58.240]  I need funds to run the operation, you need to be healthy, we need to stay on air, it's
[43:58.240 --> 43:59.920]  a match made in heaven.
[43:59.920 --> 44:04.960]  We here at Infowars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that

[44:17.960 --> 44:18.960]  effects.
[44:18.960 --> 44:24.600]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa,
[44:24.600 --> 44:28.920]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[44:28.920 --> 44:33.600]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to
[44:33.600 --> 44:34.840]  loosen up a little.
[44:34.840 --> 44:39.720]  Nowadays Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.

[45:56.160 --> 45:58.160]  That's InfowarsLife.com.
[45:58.160 --> 46:01.840]  So I did it.
[46:01.840 --> 46:04.000]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[46:04.000 --> 46:08.680]  I've been training probably not as much as they should be but thank goodness for prayer
[46:08.680 --> 46:10.680]  and thank goodness for InfowarsStore.com.
[46:10.680 --> 46:16.880]  Before I start out on a run I throw down some TurboForce to give me that energy I need to
[46:16.880 --> 46:17.880]  get going.
[46:17.880 --> 46:22.640]  You know besides the energy TurboForce it is giving me the vitamins I need like vitamin
[46:22.640 --> 46:28.240]  C to keep me healthy and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids for sustained energy
[46:28.240 --> 46:31.040]  giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[46:31.040 --> 46:34.680]  And then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones Sorilis.
[46:34.680 --> 46:39.720]  I have bad joints thanks mom so this is great for giving my joints the extra support they
[46:39.720 --> 46:44.040]  need right now plus inflammation support and extra flexibility.
[46:44.040 --> 46:48.600]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[46:48.600 --> 46:53.320]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news TurboForce that can
[46:53.320 --> 46:57.400]  still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day and Sorilis can keep you
[46:57.400 --> 47:01.840]  moving and feeling great at any age.
[47:01.840 --> 47:10.840]  Taking a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:10.840 --> 47:24.000]  Alright welcome back ladies and gentlemen the Alex Jones show.
[47:24.000 --> 47:29.720]  So you are under economic attack, I am under economic attack, globalism, transhumanism
[47:29.720 --> 47:36.640]  is an anti-human movement that seeks to dominate the very human biological systems and make
[47:36.640 --> 47:42.000]  us a corporately owned creature, those of us that are even allowed to live in their
[47:42.000 --> 47:43.880]  synthetic universe.
[47:43.880 --> 47:48.600]  So this is the opposite of free will, this is bondage down to the cellular level, this
[47:48.600 --> 47:57.000]  is rape squared to infinity and that is their plan is to play God, is to make Microsoft
[47:57.000 --> 48:00.520]  and Google God and to kill everyone else.
[48:00.520 --> 48:08.960]  I played Davos Group head scientist on TED Talk and at the Davos Group saying that two
[48:08.960 --> 48:17.600]  weeks ago on the show and that we are about to be in a post human world by 2045 that the
[48:17.600 --> 48:19.840]  last humans will be alive.
[48:19.840 --> 48:27.120]  That's not some kook out there saying that by themselves, that's the plan.
[48:27.120 --> 48:30.600]  And I guess their argument is if you don't care and let them do it to you and let them
[48:30.600 --> 48:36.800]  seduce you into the matrix, you deserve to die, well guess what, I don't and my children
[48:36.800 --> 48:43.000]  don't and I choose to not let you take control of my evolution as you say it and you got
[48:43.000 --> 48:47.680]  a new type of war, you got a new type of cult, you got a new type of brainwashing but it
[48:47.680 --> 48:54.120]  just so happens we got a transmission thousands of years ago warning us that this thing, this
[48:54.120 --> 49:01.200]  fallen entity working through collaborator humans was going to try this and it's going
[49:01.200 --> 49:15.560]  to fail but it's going to be a rough situation so I already played Trump pointing out three
[49:15.560 --> 49:20.360]  years ago that we were becoming energy independent and we're energy dependent and that Europe
[49:20.360 --> 49:25.760]  was not and we should stand up to Russia by being energy independent and now here we
[49:25.760 --> 49:30.840]  are all these years later and we're now energy dependent and Biden won't let us turn any
[49:30.840 --> 49:35.880]  of our drilling on or our pipelines on but he's increasing oil purchases from Saudi
[49:35.880 --> 49:40.600]  Arabia and from Venezuela and Russia.
[49:40.600 --> 49:50.600]  Unbelievable so here is Buddha judge says buying oil from Iran is on the table.
[49:50.600 --> 49:56.240]  Could the president possibly consider authorizing the Keystone Pipeline, working something out
[49:56.240 --> 49:57.240]  with Iran?
[49:57.240 --> 50:04.640]  I mean look the president has said that all options are on the table but we also need
[50:04.640 --> 50:10.840]  to make sure that we're not galloping after permanent solutions to immediate short term
[50:10.840 --> 50:17.680]  problems where more strategic and tactical actions in the short term can make a difference.
[50:17.680 --> 50:22.440]  Tactical actions that's right windmills that don't work it's all designed to bankrupt you
[50:22.440 --> 50:28.160]  it's not designed to work they're suppressing all the real clean technology that's on record.
[50:28.160 --> 50:33.600]  Here's the energy secretary Graham Holm saying we're working through the energy transition
[50:33.600 --> 50:40.240]  and even AOC and Pelosi admitted recently oh we could cut energy prices but that wouldn't
[50:40.240 --> 50:46.040]  be good for the earth this is a great reset here is Graham Holm.
[50:46.040 --> 50:51.360]  But the bottom line is that this president and this administration are looking at every
[50:51.360 --> 50:57.640]  single tool to shield American families from the impact of rising energy prices and we're
[50:57.640 --> 51:03.280]  working through we're working through an energy transition and we've got to start by
[51:03.280 --> 51:10.400]  adding energy and the reality is we have to take some time to get off of oil and gas we
[51:10.400 --> 51:13.840]  recognize this this is a transition.
[51:13.840 --> 51:17.080]  Now let's have a little sharing on top here because I need to move on to the huge news
[51:17.080 --> 51:20.680]  and Ukraine and the economy and how it's all intertwined together.
[51:20.680 --> 51:28.240]  Here is Saki saying the reason gas prices are going up is because Putin invaded Iran
[51:28.240 --> 51:32.160]  that'd be like if I walked up with a giant axe and cut off one of your legs at the hip
[51:32.160 --> 51:38.000]  and blood was spring everywhere and then I sliced your arm open too but most of the
[51:38.000 --> 51:41.840]  blood is coming out your leg you're about to die in a few seconds and then I kind of
[51:41.840 --> 51:45.880]  stab you in the arm a little bit of blood comes out there and then I go oh you're dying
[51:45.880 --> 51:51.840]  from the stab in your arm yeah 30 40 cents of the increase has been what's happened in
[51:51.840 --> 51:58.720]  Ukraine and that's true and so does Obama's minion Biden open up the strategic reserve
[51:58.720 --> 52:02.520]  does he open up the keystone pipeline does he take all the restrictions off he put in
[52:02.520 --> 52:07.680]  executive orders on new drilling no no no no no no no no no no no no he doesn't do that
[52:07.680 --> 52:12.760]  and then they turn around and they blame Vladimir Putin ladies and gentlemen no it's the globalist
[52:12.760 --> 52:22.800]  turning off your power Russians pay about 60 cents a gallon in Russia that's right it's
[52:22.800 --> 52:26.840]  basically sold at cost to the public because they want the economy going like Henry Ford
[52:26.840 --> 52:30.560]  said I want to pay people five times when anybody else pays him because I want to have
[52:30.560 --> 52:34.920]  enough money to buy my car I want to have an economy the globalists don't want an economy
[52:34.920 --> 52:40.240]  like that they want one where you starve to death where they can lord that above you it's
[52:40.240 --> 52:44.120]  called feudalism it's called serfdom it used to be the system of government worldwide for
[52:44.120 --> 52:52.920]  thousands of years until the Renaissance 500 years ago in Europe in Germany and in England
[52:52.920 --> 52:58.720]  and the Gutenberg press look into it and they know we're on the verge of the next wave of
[52:58.720 --> 53:03.440]  the Renaissance true enlightenment true empowerment and they're trying to suppress it all with
[53:03.440 --> 53:08.400]  their great reset that is an attempt to keep us in their dark ages this is the final grasp
[53:08.400 --> 53:12.960]  of the royalty and the old money that's been trying for 500 years to suppress humanity
[53:12.960 --> 53:16.720]  and they look at all the technology that we designed and built and tell us that they built
[53:16.720 --> 53:20.600]  it in their gods and now they're trying to twist the technology to enslave us instead
[53:20.600 --> 53:30.120]  of empowering us we're on the verge of the infinity Renaissance Renaissance taken to
[53:30.120 --> 53:38.360]  no limits unlimited here is sake gas lighting you the reason why the price of gas is going
[53:38.360 --> 53:43.440]  up is not because of steps the president has taken they are because president Putin is
[53:43.440 --> 53:49.960]  invading Ukraine and that is creating a great deal of instability in the global marketplace
[53:49.960 --> 53:58.520]  I mean technically out some of the new increases is that but Biden policies are what has allowed
[53:58.520 --> 54:04.080]  that dependence to now cause this chain reaction because of America was not just keeping us
[54:04.080 --> 54:08.960]  where we were but increasing production for the world to not just be the leader in energy
[54:08.960 --> 54:12.440]  production as we were a few years ago we're now not we're an importer not an exporter
[54:12.440 --> 54:19.640]  now of net energy this could be a boom for America what Russia is doing but no no no
[54:19.640 --> 54:24.600]  you don't get booms we don't want oil field workers making seventy thousand dollars a
[54:24.600 --> 54:28.840]  year busting their ass they might put a kid through college they might save some money
[54:28.840 --> 54:33.280]  that actually gives American workers a job we don't want them we want them in there watching
[54:33.280 --> 54:38.640]  the metaverse we want their kids getting sterilized with the big tech funded transsexualism an
[54:38.640 --> 54:44.560]  article on that today we want America under our foot because we are the leftist rulers
[54:44.560 --> 54:50.960]  we are the masters we are the controllers all right here's what I'm going to do it'll
[54:50.960 --> 54:55.000]  take me a good forty five minutes to go through what really happened with COVID and where
[54:55.000 --> 55:00.280]  we are and the fact that their whole system collapsed their lies all collapsed and now
[55:00.280 --> 55:07.040]  they just want us to forget about it and move on to the next scam no because it's all intertwined
[55:07.040 --> 55:11.240]  to the great reset just like they're running the energy scam to collapse us by design we
[55:11.240 --> 55:15.760]  got to expose that and just like they ran the COVID scam to collapse us and to destroy
[55:15.760 --> 55:22.480]  confidence and to kill a bunch of people we got to expose that and every step of the way
[55:22.480 --> 55:28.240]  we fight fight fight fight fight because when we don't submit and when we're informed and
[55:28.240 --> 55:35.640]  when we support independent good guys evil gets its ass handed to it every single time
[55:35.640 --> 55:41.600]  but when Thomas Jefferson was asked during the Revolutionary War more than two hundred
[55:41.600 --> 55:50.360]  and fifty years ago the very start of the war they said what does it take to stop tyrants
[55:50.360 --> 55:57.720]  he wrote in a letter famously all that evil men in tyrants need to flourish is good men
[55:57.720 --> 56:04.480]  doing nothing all that evil men in tyrants need to flourish is that good men do nothing
[56:04.480 --> 56:13.560]  it's a very simple all that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men do nothing
[56:13.560 --> 56:22.320]  all that evil men in tyrants need to flourish is that good men do nothing and that counts
[56:22.320 --> 56:27.840]  for women as well in our day and age and there were women fighting back then as well so men
[56:27.840 --> 56:31.720]  and women better step up and decide what side they're on people better spend their time their
[56:31.720 --> 56:36.360]  energy and their money or they're going to lose it all we have the money we have the
[56:36.360 --> 56:41.240]  smarts we have the ingenuity to peacefully overthrow this thing but everybody's got
[56:41.240 --> 56:47.960]  to go all in now speaking of that everybody should get an info wars t-shirt everybody

[1:04:17.680 --> 1:04:22.240]  article kello Mcgreen wrote about it but i want to add the sub headline or a third headline
[1:04:22.240 --> 1:04:32.680]  that humanity has experienced the largest experiment in psychological and biological

[1:07:03.640 --> 1:07:10.600]  across this planet and it's forcing everybody to choose which side they're gonna be on are
[1:07:10.600 --> 1:07:14.440]  you gonna be free were you born to be wild given free will by god are you gonna be a
[1:07:14.440 --> 1:07:23.400]  slave of the new world order and big tech that is the question and i say we're born
[1:07:23.400 --> 1:07:33.800]  to be wild i know we're born to be wild but in that wildness then make the choice of free
[1:07:33.800 --> 1:07:43.360]  will to align ourselves with god we really should celebrate a little bit we haven't won
[1:07:43.360 --> 1:07:48.320]  the war but we've really won some big battles and we've really given the globalist a bloody
[1:07:48.320 --> 1:07:54.360]  nose and some broken ribs and a couple big stab wounds right in their guts the new world
[1:07:54.360 --> 1:07:59.320]  orders stuff in its guts back in the holes we punched in there they're in big trouble
[1:07:59.320 --> 1:08:05.560]  right now that's why the builder bird group and debos would say in the last decade you
[1:08:05.560 --> 1:08:09.960]  try to shut down the debos group you try to shut down the european union you try to end
[1:08:09.960 --> 1:08:18.440]  globalism there'll be a war you can look those headlines up in europe and people say well
[1:08:18.440 --> 1:08:24.520]  how's that gonna happen well you saw how it happened is puttin in on it i don't know but
[1:08:24.520 --> 1:08:28.960]  i'm telling you we could predict there'd be war with russia and now china coming up as
[1:08:28.960 --> 1:08:35.280]  soon as the covid operation was pushed as far as they could get it as soon as it was
[1:08:35.280 --> 1:08:39.000]  getting more negatives and positives for them as soon as it was waking people up and and
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:43.280]  galvanizing resistance and as soon as the public is waking up they back off hoping we
[1:08:43.280 --> 1:08:49.320]  don't have a memory hoping we don't remember so we've been through hell i've lost friends
[1:08:49.320 --> 1:08:54.080]  i've lost family i know most of you have as well from the bio weapon that they cooked
[1:08:54.080 --> 1:09:00.640]  up at wuhan and relief and it's all declassified now that faucian gates had the patent for
[1:09:00.640 --> 1:09:08.880]  it with moderna feiser was involved that all came out a few weeks ago but we already knew
[1:09:08.880 --> 1:09:14.160]  two years ago but now confirmed what the indian scientist and australian scientist first said
[1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:26.800]  25 months ago in february actually late january it's more than 25 months and so i was sent
[1:09:26.800 --> 1:09:32.160]  just telling you where i got it a thread saturday by my good friend he's might have heard of
[1:09:32.160 --> 1:09:36.040]  him he's a popular podcaster and he said he said he's gonna do something on it as well
[1:09:36.040 --> 1:09:43.040]  and i said well i am too thanks for sending it and it's this this link by sir fadwick
[1:09:43.040 --> 1:09:51.960]  of hotelton which obviously is a numb to plume joke name and it's now that cobert is over
[1:09:51.960 --> 1:10:01.280]  here is a threat of everything they want you to forget and boy this individual posted over
[1:10:01.280 --> 1:10:07.800]  a hundred documents and stories that i'd forgotten about many of them but they also had been
[1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:12.360]  thousands of people under it hosting even more insane things that are on record that
[1:10:12.360 --> 1:10:20.960]  the globalist actually did in the biggest psychological warfare test the world's ever
[1:10:20.960 --> 1:10:27.000]  seen that was backed up by a real bio weapon and then an injection that was many times
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:34.640]  stronger than the actual virus that was manmade that they owned the patents to with the hiv
[1:10:34.640 --> 1:10:46.040]  spike protein now causing vaccine autoimmune deficiency syndrome around the world bates
[1:10:46.040 --> 1:10:53.480]  and i have mainline scientists other saying in israel in the uk in canada in the us people
[1:10:53.480 --> 1:10:59.840]  have fast acting hiv now where you don't wait three four years for to eat your white blood
[1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:07.640]  cells this is this is people are getting AIDS like stuff cancers you get the cold and just
[1:11:07.640 --> 1:11:15.040]  die shriveling up and dying because the white blood cells are gone and people ask well how
[1:11:15.040 --> 1:11:22.240]  are they going to get away with this well it's the same way that i said they would with
[1:11:22.240 --> 1:11:26.480]  a new war and economic collapse distract you from what they already done so let's play
[1:11:26.480 --> 1:11:33.320]  a clip from doctors elenco who warned of this two years ago saying it will give you autoimmune
[1:11:33.320 --> 1:11:38.000]  deficiency disorder because he can read what scientists were warning about dr. yedon the
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:45.440]  former had a phizer biomedical division and so much more and doctors elenco said these
[1:11:45.440 --> 1:11:50.160]  shots have destroyed the immune system people that took two shots are worse than people
[1:11:50.160 --> 1:11:56.880]  that took three shots even worse they've acquired immune deficiency syndrome and he's now been
[1:11:56.880 --> 1:12:01.340]  vindicated in all of that so here's a clip of what he had to say that i'm gonna start
[1:12:01.340 --> 1:12:08.880]  drilling into what they want you to forget about so according to Israeli funeral directors
[1:12:08.880 --> 1:12:17.640]  and their own papers they're seeing a thousand percent increase in debt yeah 10x if one person
[1:12:17.640 --> 1:12:24.320]  would die a day kind of died a day and the ages are much much younger and the causes
[1:12:24.320 --> 1:12:31.240]  of death are ridiculous 20 year old just didn't wake up two days after taking a shot well
[1:12:31.240 --> 1:12:37.560]  stuff like that i mean that's the norm mm-hmm and so and Israel is the most immunized country
[1:12:37.560 --> 1:12:42.840]  in the world yes especially from the perspective of multiple boosters Israel is the number one
[1:12:42.840 --> 1:12:49.480]  country with three and four with with people that got to three or four shots and what is
[1:12:49.480 --> 1:12:56.760]  the official cause of death according to the government how well let's analyze that
[1:12:56.760 --> 1:13:04.800]  omicron is much more infectious than measles there is no way to stop the spread of omicron
[1:13:04.800 --> 1:13:10.000]  not even this is like a protocol can't help you there but the good part of omicron is
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:18.120]  that it limits its damage to the upper airway not the lower airway which killed most people
[1:13:18.120 --> 1:13:26.360]  and so it causes a bad flu okay okay we could deal with that we can mitigate those symptoms
[1:13:26.360 --> 1:13:33.240]  we can even prevent the strategies and by the way to contradict the Israeli data no one
[1:13:33.240 --> 1:13:37.600]  else died from omicron essentially i don't know that's still yes especially in South
[1:13:37.600 --> 1:13:43.480]  Africa where it came out America for sure and my practice directly no one's dying from
[1:13:43.480 --> 1:13:48.400]  omicron it's really easy to treat if you do it in the right time frame so why are Israelis
[1:13:48.400 --> 1:13:53.320]  dying from omicron and i'm not denying that they're dying from omicron but there's another
[1:13:53.320 --> 1:14:05.280]  reason there are dozens of peer reviewed papers that show that these shots have destroyed the
[1:14:05.280 --> 1:14:12.160]  innate immune system or damaged and it's dose relevant it's people that took two shots
[1:14:12.160 --> 1:14:18.400]  are worse than people that took one shot three even worse for so it gets worse as you continually
[1:14:18.400 --> 1:14:30.440]  take the booster yeah it's dose related apparently so so what the majority of Israelis have they've
[1:14:30.440 --> 1:14:40.560]  acquired something I'm using words very very carefully they've acquired an immune deficiency
[1:14:40.560 --> 1:14:55.040]  syndrome they have eights oh he didn't just say that this year last year he said the year
[1:14:55.040 --> 1:15:01.320]  before it so did dr. Yedon chief science from scientist from Pfizer he retired the year before
[1:15:01.320 --> 1:15:06.920]  and a bunch of other top scientists because they looked at the damn spike protein of HIV
[1:15:06.920 --> 1:15:15.760]  in COVID and said this is man-made and this is what this virus will do Bill Gates just
[1:15:15.760 --> 1:15:21.800]  injected billions of people with Fauci with the spike protein that causes the shutdown
[1:15:21.800 --> 1:15:30.240]  of the white blood cells and the normal virus they released as that as well it kills you
[1:15:30.240 --> 1:15:37.520]  slowly now when we come back we're gonna chronicle we're gonna go back in time and then there's
[1:15:37.520 --> 1:15:42.480]  no place to even start some's recent some happened two years ago but it's insane the
[1:15:42.480 --> 1:15:47.800]  abuse and the psychological warfare to try to pressure us into taking this injection
[1:15:47.800 --> 1:15:59.760]  that gives you fades vaccine-induced aids hold it right back it's hard to believe that we're
[1:15:59.760 --> 1:16:06.560]  already into March 2022 and in the month of February we had a very popular sale that was
[1:16:06.560 --> 1:16:13.440]  going of our flagship product X3 that has all three types of the amazing iodine your
[1:16:13.440 --> 1:16:19.920]  body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity in your body your immune system your
[1:16:19.920 --> 1:16:26.320]  stamina your libido so much and the majority of the population the world is iodine deficient
[1:16:26.320 --> 1:16:30.920]  this is the very best iodine out there so we have on cell 50% off but we sold more than
[1:16:30.920 --> 1:16:36.000]  half of what we have or isn't gonna come in for a long time so I took it back to full
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:40.480]  process I was just thinking you know what we need the funds in now to stay on air plus
[1:16:40.480 --> 1:16:44.840]  this is a great product everybody needs so to incentivize folks out there that have been
[1:16:44.840 --> 1:16:49.440]  on the fence to get X3 and experience it yourself and support the broadcast I'm gonna keep it
[1:16:49.440 --> 1:16:56.280]  at 50% off until it sells out get X3 right now exclusively at infowarstore.com or 50%
[1:16:56.280 --> 1:17:04.040]  off it has been noted by many a historian the first casualty of war is the truth then
[1:17:04.040 --> 1:17:11.320]  the next big casualty isn't even the people that die no that invariably follows but first
[1:17:11.320 --> 1:17:19.000]  there is the crackdown on populations basic liberty and speech and massive censorship
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:24.760]  and now across the world from the United States to Europe legislations being introduced
[1:17:24.760 --> 1:17:34.080]  that if you amplify any quote pro-russian information you can be censored you can be
[1:17:34.080 --> 1:17:39.080]  arrested you can be a prisoner and of course now Canada is under this legislation that
[1:17:39.080 --> 1:17:45.440]  if you have a fought crime and they think you may have the intent to engage in hate speech
[1:17:45.440 --> 1:17:50.800]  online that you will be censored and arrested ladies and gentlemen the authoritarianism
[1:17:50.800 --> 1:17:55.240]  is being carried out by the globalists around the world against humanity that makes info

[1:19:05.840 --> 1:19:13.280]  to attain and when it comes to information boy is that true today we see the entire global
[1:19:13.280 --> 1:19:20.120]  corrupt into a human depopulation great reset combine trying to collapse our society to build
[1:19:20.120 --> 1:19:27.160]  on its ashes their their transhumanist nightmare vision suppressing the voices of good people
[1:19:27.160 --> 1:19:33.280]  all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives
[1:19:33.280 --> 1:19:39.120]  their COVID hysteria their world's gonna end in 2030 carbon tax global warming bull all
[1:19:39.120 --> 1:19:45.280]  of it and none of it can succeed none of it can actually be carried out unless everybody
[1:19:45.280 --> 1:19:51.200]  is silenced and gas lit that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and diligence
[1:19:51.200 --> 1:19:55.600]  and that's why it's hard to share info wars links and band up video links that's why we've
[1:19:55.600 --> 1:20:02.640]  got to share them now more than ever leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world

[1:20:54.880 --> 1:21:04.320]  of truth is we're gonna bring down the new world order we're starting to fight for the
[1:21:04.320 --> 1:21:14.120]  system and our destruction will be a burning light lead humanity out of the dark if that's
[1:21:14.120 --> 1:21:20.120]  God's choice if I make it out of this it's a little long life after this that's all
[1:21:20.120 --> 1:21:28.560]  gravy I've made my decision and I'm free of the new world order now all right let's get
[1:21:28.560 --> 1:21:35.360]  into it here we go this is a feed and a lot of people joined in on it so I'm only covering
[1:21:35.360 --> 1:21:40.040]  the tip of the iceberg the tip of the iceberg is like Mount Everest the evidence is so incredible
[1:21:40.040 --> 1:21:46.800]  now that COVID is over here is a thread of everything they want you to forget I'm gonna
[1:21:46.800 --> 1:21:50.360]  move quickly through these because there's hundreds of them but just think back of what's
[1:21:50.360 --> 1:21:56.100]  gone on the last 26 months black lives matter protests may have slowed the overall spread
[1:21:56.100 --> 1:22:01.920]  of coronavirus in Denver and other cities new study finds but anybody else going out
[1:22:01.920 --> 1:22:08.280]  in public is bad only leftist can go out women actually wore cones of shame around their

[1:33:28.640 --> 1:33:57.360]  we have all been experiencing a giant criminal experiment a psychological warfare operation
[1:33:57.360 --> 1:34:03.680]  overlaid with a bio weapon synthetic release and then face to the deadly injection so you
[1:34:03.680 --> 1:34:08.200]  would take it then that stock home syndrome and cover up the fact that you were attacked
[1:34:08.200 --> 1:34:11.960]  because you can't face the full hour that you've been scammed that you've been lied
[1:34:11.960 --> 1:34:18.960]  to that you've been hurt and so many doctors and institutions and lawyers and hospitals
[1:34:18.960 --> 1:34:25.040]  and schools and media got on board with a lie of not letting people see their families
[1:34:25.040 --> 1:34:32.180]  in nursing homes and then killing 20,000 in New York on record you can't see your parents
[1:34:32.180 --> 1:34:36.520]  even though you're healthy but ship sick people in to kill them and then innovate them to
[1:34:36.520 --> 1:34:42.960]  make all the money and the same thing in Spain and Australia and New Zealand oh you can't
[1:34:42.960 --> 1:34:50.440]  see your children if you don't take the shot and all over the world they catch governments
[1:34:50.440 --> 1:34:56.960]  from California to New South Wales giving children the injections without parental authorization
[1:34:56.960 --> 1:35:03.320]  it's all a giant fascist biomedical test to see what they can get away with and Connecticut
[1:35:03.320 --> 1:35:09.600]  did it again last year and you know this list of things I went over I've got some more here
[1:35:09.600 --> 1:35:13.440]  it's just the tip of the iceberg because in this list and other people are adding to it
[1:35:13.440 --> 1:35:18.280]  there's thousands of things being put up what about the New Zealand leaders saying don't
[1:35:18.280 --> 1:35:22.680]  look at the sunset of the Australian leaders saying don't talk to your neighbors what about
[1:35:22.680 --> 1:35:27.360]  beating up the women and children and men and riding over people with horses all over
[1:35:27.360 --> 1:35:31.600]  Europe all over Canada all over or arresting people that peacefully protested in Canada
[1:35:31.600 --> 1:35:36.360]  and charging them with 10 years in prison shackling them in their bond hearings and not giving
[1:35:36.360 --> 1:35:43.400]  them bonds what about that you see you start trying to think about all the stuff they've
[1:35:43.400 --> 1:35:51.800]  done to us or how about all the dead people how about the 40% increase in death all over
[1:35:51.800 --> 1:35:55.440]  the world by insurance companies reporting that it's the healthy that took the shots
[1:35:55.440 --> 1:36:03.280]  that are dying you can't ignore this a tenfold increase in the background level of natural
[1:36:03.280 --> 1:36:08.440]  death no one's ever seen this in world war one world war two never there everybody knows
[1:36:08.440 --> 1:36:13.560]  what's going on they're killing us with the viral release and with the injection that
[1:36:13.560 --> 1:36:18.640]  then erases your immune system and gives you vades let's get back to this Omicron and Delta
[1:36:18.640 --> 1:36:23.360]  may strike people at the same time and combine to create even worse cupboard variant the

[1:45:12.440 --> 1:45:18.360]  its relaxation and euphoric effects according to ancient samoan legend kava was given as a
[1:45:18.360 --> 1:45:25.160]  gift by the sun god tagaloa who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe
[1:45:25.160 --> 1:45:30.600]  the samoan people would drink kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up

[1:45:57.240 --> 1:46:05.000]  social insiders always intended to push their coveted biomedical tyranny lockdowns until
[1:46:05.000 --> 1:46:11.080]  the populations rebelled they would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law
[1:46:11.080 --> 1:46:17.080]  and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives but because of so many
[1:46:17.080 --> 1:46:23.320]  scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers now their
[1:46:23.320 --> 1:46:29.960]  whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government corporate
[1:46:29.960 --> 1:46:35.800]  takeover and so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever the problem is some globalist
[1:46:35.800 --> 1:46:41.720]  controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover like canada where they've now declared a
[1:46:41.720 --> 1:46:47.160]  civil emergency and martial law in ontario and other areas of the world are following suit like
[1:46:47.160 --> 1:46:52.520]  australia so pray for these folks big time this is a very serious situation and stay tuned into
[1:46:52.520 --> 1:47:01.160]  info wars dot com because truth is absolutely paramount leading a frontal assault on the lies
[1:47:01.160 --> 1:47:08.280]  of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:47:31.160 --> 1:47:42.280]  so
[1:47:47.400 --> 1:47:52.280]  all right here's what i'm going to do
[1:47:52.440 --> 1:47:58.280]  i'm going to hit the latest covid news with our special guest a whistleblower emerald robinson
[1:47:58.280 --> 1:48:05.880]  coming up in the next hour and she worked at newsmax and oan she's not blowing the whistle on newsmax
[1:48:07.240 --> 1:48:14.760]  or oan in particular she's just exposing what happened with big pharma and big media and the
[1:48:14.760 --> 1:48:20.360]  and the payoffs but oan didn't do anything it was newsmax that reportedly took the money
[1:48:21.480 --> 1:48:25.560]  so you can call that whistleblowing you can call it what you want the truth is she's just
[1:48:25.560 --> 1:48:36.520]  telling the truth so emerald robinson is going to be joining us coming up in the next hour this is a
[1:48:37.080 --> 1:48:46.200]  big big deal it is so illegal to have the federal government take taxpayer money and
[1:48:46.200 --> 1:48:54.760]  secretly pay out over a billion dollars to corporate media from cnn to fox news from newsmax to the
[1:48:54.760 --> 1:49:02.440]  new york times to agree to not run any anti-vax news and to agree to cover up what's happening and
[1:49:02.440 --> 1:49:07.400]  to agree to put out talking points to the public and then not tell the public you're doing it
[1:49:07.400 --> 1:49:13.800]  while big tech it's also invested in big pharma censors all the opposition what a perfect storm
[1:49:13.800 --> 1:49:21.480]  of evil to have big tech big dinosaur legacy media with a corrupt out of control government
[1:49:21.480 --> 1:49:27.480]  and big pharma owned by the big central banks eugenicist and bill gates right at the center of
[1:49:27.480 --> 1:49:37.000]  it but as scary as all of this is the good news is melinda gates has come out against her husband
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:41.880]  and jeffrey epstein the whole world's coming out against these deadly shots the truth is getting
[1:49:41.880 --> 1:49:46.200]  out there and so we need to just keep hammering and hammering and hammering and hammering and hammering
[1:49:46.200 --> 1:49:53.000]  and point out that the federal government was giving money to school districts to to to push
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:57.800]  all these lies and to force these masks and so this is going to be their waterloo where we
[1:49:57.800 --> 1:50:03.080]  peacefully take back the city councils take back the legislatures take back the school boards take
[1:50:03.080 --> 1:50:09.960]  back everything and say no to these monsters so that's coming up next hour i want to talk about
[1:50:09.960 --> 1:50:18.440]  russia some and what's unfolding and some of the biggest threats that are faced there
[1:50:20.120 --> 1:50:23.880]  and i want to get into this first because it ties into so many so many things here's the
[1:50:23.880 --> 1:50:35.240]  headline out of roiders putin's nuclear comments lead to rush for iodine in central europe google
[1:50:35.240 --> 1:50:43.400]  searches for iodine pills skyrockets steel bunkers iodine pills and canned food fear of the nuclear
[1:50:43.400 --> 1:50:51.240]  apocalypse is back and there's a lot of breakdowns into all that information but i don't take iodine
[1:50:51.240 --> 1:50:57.320]  high quality deep breath crystal iodine because i'm worried about nuclear war though it does
[1:50:57.320 --> 1:51:03.320]  protect you from some isotopes in the thyroid so that your thyroid doesn't absorb the radioactive
[1:51:03.320 --> 1:51:09.400]  iodine that's produced in a hydrogen bomb detonation and then basically your thyroid dies
[1:51:09.960 --> 1:51:15.960]  and then you die so it's important to have your thyroid full of good iodine because your thyroid
[1:51:15.960 --> 1:51:21.240]  produces a lot of the hormones or produces the precursor so your glands can produce hormones
[1:51:21.800 --> 1:51:29.080]  but it's not just radioactive iodine in a nuclear war it's bromine bromide chlorine fluoride that they
[1:51:29.080 --> 1:51:37.400]  bomb us with that attacks our fertility that attacks our cells that attacks our dna that attacks
[1:51:37.400 --> 1:51:44.040]  our brain cells our development everything and every time i just type in iodine deficiency into
[1:51:44.040 --> 1:51:50.440]  duck duck go or even google still still has accurate searches though most of searches have been corrupted
[1:51:50.440 --> 1:51:59.560]  you go read the wikipedia iodine or you can go read club md or the national institutes of health
[1:51:59.560 --> 1:52:04.280]  and they all say the same thing is it's settled science not like settled science and global warming
[1:52:04.280 --> 1:52:08.280]  or settled science on these vaccines work when they were lying to you but that if you don't have
[1:52:08.280 --> 1:52:13.720]  iodine you get sick you die and what's incredible is when you read even the wikipedia page that
[1:52:13.720 --> 1:52:21.720]  links to the nih they admit well you don't need iodine anymore they're fortifying our food with
[1:52:21.720 --> 1:52:31.800]  bromide well your body will absorb bromide if it doesn't have iodine and it'll use fluoride too but
[1:52:31.800 --> 1:52:36.840]  it will totally whack out your endocrine system in all your hormones if you're getting bromide
[1:52:36.840 --> 1:52:46.360]  bromine fluoride fluorine fluoride that's a fact but they say here oh no don't worry you don't
[1:52:46.360 --> 1:52:51.480]  need iodine additives anymore in your food like they used to do that boosted iq 15 points they
[1:52:51.480 --> 1:52:57.880]  started introducing it in the 20s they stopped it by the 60s you need fluoride which on record
[1:52:58.600 --> 1:53:02.520]  fries your body and ends up killing you these people are sick ladies and gentlemen
[1:53:02.520 --> 1:53:08.680]  so let's go over this right here iodine is an essential dietary mineral for neuro
[1:53:09.240 --> 1:53:15.880]  development among children the thyroid hormones theroxine and it goes on contain iodine
[1:53:16.760 --> 1:53:22.280]  in areas that there is little iodine in the diet typically remote inland areas where no marine
[1:53:22.280 --> 1:53:27.800]  foods are eaten iodine deficiency is common it is also common in mountainous regions of the world
[1:53:27.800 --> 1:53:32.360]  that's why the famous thing about all the mentally retarded mountain people where the food is grown
[1:53:32.360 --> 1:53:42.280]  in iodine poor soil prevention includes adding small amounts of iodine to table salt that goes on
[1:53:42.280 --> 1:53:48.520]  from there in the u.s the use of iodine was decreased over concerns of overdose since the
[1:53:48.520 --> 1:53:56.760]  mid 20th century and the iodine antagonist bromide and fluoride had been more ubiquitous oh
[1:53:56.760 --> 1:54:04.520]  in particular in the 1980s the practice of using potassium iodate as dough conditioner in bread
[1:54:04.520 --> 1:54:09.880]  and baked goods was gradually replaced by the use of other conditioning agents such as bromide
[1:54:11.640 --> 1:54:15.560]  so they they take the good halogen out the one you need and they give you the bad ones
[1:54:15.560 --> 1:54:21.400]  unbelievable and it just goes on congenital iodine deficiency syndrome goes into over two
[1:54:21.400 --> 1:54:28.600]  billion people brain damage lower IQs worldwide from it two billion people individuals of insufficient
[1:54:28.600 --> 1:54:36.360]  iodine intake a third being school aged children it just goes on from there you need to go read this
[1:54:37.560 --> 1:54:41.000]  for yourself ladies and gentlemen 10 signs and symptoms of iodine deficiency
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:47.880]  obesity lethargy heart problems it just goes on and the average person has absolute deficiencies
[1:54:47.880 --> 1:54:52.120]  because even the level the FDA says is too low scientists say because they keep lowering what
[1:54:52.120 --> 1:54:55.720]  they want you to have they want to kill you they want to dump you down they want you to be morons

[1:55:21.240 --> 1:55:25.720]  those on and on go read it for yourself the point i'm making is the people perish
[1:55:26.280 --> 1:55:32.600]  for lack of knowledge so i don't sell iodine for radiological events though it's important for
[1:55:32.600 --> 1:55:37.400]  your whole body i sell it and promote it because we've got the best out there both the x2 and the

[1:55:41.960 --> 1:55:47.000]  better the other good types as well but because of the big rush on iodine going on right now
[1:55:47.800 --> 1:55:51.080]  and we're going to sell out soon as well i had already gone back to a regular price because

[1:59:04.520 --> 1:59:11.640]  and speech and massive censorship and now across the world from the united states to europe legislations

[2:00:03.000 --> 2:00:09.160]  coming up with a lot of stations join us emerald robinson is going to be coming on to talk about
[2:00:09.160 --> 2:00:14.280]  some incredible breaking news that she was a witness to we're not just singling out newsmax but
[2:00:14.280 --> 2:00:19.640]  it's it's it's really quite the scandal that's coming up we've also got some good news russia
[2:00:20.280 --> 2:00:25.000]  and ukraine agreed to meet in turkey about a real ceasefire and deal that's coming up
[2:00:25.000 --> 2:00:29.880]  we'll be breaking that down as well but i really wanted to play this greg rees report
[2:00:29.880 --> 2:00:34.600]  that needs to get more than a 400 000 video it needs to get 20 million views because it's
[2:00:34.600 --> 2:00:40.120]  confirmed that the us that was involved of course built a bunch of bio weapon labs in eastern europe
[2:00:40.120 --> 2:00:54.680]  ukraine that's not a fake story here it is for years now russia has made verifiable claims
[2:00:54.680 --> 2:01:01.480]  that the us is running secret biological weapons labs around their borders and while western media
[2:01:01.480 --> 2:01:09.640]  now claims this to be misinformation back in 2013 they reported on it while the united states and
[2:01:09.640 --> 2:01:16.440]  murder incorporated have been waging illegal wars all across the world in the name of democracy russia
[2:01:16.440 --> 2:01:22.440]  has been quietly selling energy and minding their own business the national geographic this was the
[2:01:22.440 --> 2:01:27.800]  reason why the pentagon was building these bio weapons labs in the first place because russia
[2:01:27.800 --> 2:01:34.920]  was entirely quiet on the subject and the us wanted to get ahead of them the initial biolab in
[2:01:34.920 --> 2:01:43.320]  kazakhstan was built by the us for 100 million dollars to store high-risk diseases such as plague
[2:01:43.320 --> 2:01:49.880]  and anthrax and was hoping to attract scientists who might otherwise create biological weapons
[2:01:49.880 --> 2:01:58.600]  of mass destruction for someone else in order to keep the world safe the us has since built
[2:01:58.600 --> 2:02:07.080]  several labs in kazakhstan most recently a biosafety level four lab to be completed in early 2022
[2:02:08.120 --> 2:02:16.760]  as early as 2004 the pentagon's defense threat reduction agency dta began creating a network
[2:02:16.760 --> 2:02:23.960]  of biolabs for infectious diseases in uzbekistan and within a few years after operations began
[2:02:23.960 --> 2:02:31.160]  outbreaks of unknown diseases were reported in the same areas as the labs in georgia leaked
[2:02:31.160 --> 2:02:37.080]  documents show that the us embassy has been transporting deadly pathogens and human blood
[2:02:37.080 --> 2:02:43.640]  as diplomatic cargo in a scheme where private us contractors working for three different us
[2:02:43.640 --> 2:02:51.400]  biolabs have been given diplomatic immunity to do so shortly after russia invaded ukraine
[2:02:51.400 --> 2:02:58.760]  at war clandestine released a video with maps of us biolabs matching up with maps of the recent
[2:02:58.760 --> 2:03:06.040]  attack suggesting that russia was securing these top secret biolabs western media claims this is
[2:03:06.040 --> 2:03:13.320]  false but fails to debunk it and once the video goes viral the us embassy in ukraine is caught
[2:03:13.320 --> 2:03:19.080]  deleting evidence of these labs from their website but not before an independent journalist was able
[2:03:19.080 --> 2:03:26.120]  to copy documents showing 11 ukrainian biolabs funded by the pentagon the russian embassy to
[2:03:26.120 --> 2:03:33.880]  bosnia has accused the us of filling ukraine with biolabs which were very possibly used to study
[2:03:33.880 --> 2:03:40.280]  methods for destroying the russian people at the genetic level and we now know that these so-called
[2:03:40.280 --> 2:03:47.400]  mRNA vaccines are destroying people at the genetic level we now officially know that covid-19 is a
[2:03:47.400 --> 2:03:53.640]  man-made bio weapon we know that it was funded by elements of the nih and peter dazik's eco
[2:03:53.640 --> 2:04:00.840]  health alliance we know that it was made in wuhan china and so what isn't threatening about the us
[2:04:00.840 --> 2:04:07.560]  encircling russia with top secret biolabs and who on earth thinks it's a coincidence that everyone
[2:04:07.560 --> 2:04:14.200]  involved in the united nation's great reset are now the ukraine's greatest allies of all time
[2:04:14.200 --> 2:04:20.920]  the mercenaries and war profiteers in america are getting excited about making short-term profits
[2:04:20.920 --> 2:04:26.920]  off the dead but the only ones who will benefit from this war are the crooks at the top who have
[2:04:26.920 --> 2:04:32.280]  been caught committing the most heinous crime against humanity in all of recorded history
[2:04:33.160 --> 2:04:40.280]  and the only righteous way out of this is to hold these crooks accountable reporting for info wars
[2:04:40.280 --> 2:04:47.960]  this is greg reese wow ladies and gentlemen all right emerald robinson is our guest she
[2:04:47.960 --> 2:04:53.480]  hosts a popular show now with frank speech dot com we'll talk to her on the other side in 60 seconds
[2:04:58.520 --> 2:05:03.800]  two of our best-selling products are back in stock then fullwarstore.com and they will sell out
[2:05:03.800 --> 2:05:08.600]  in the next three four months before i get more of the product in if i sell it at full price but i
[2:05:08.600 --> 2:05:14.520]  want those of you that have been on the fence about getting one or son or getting x3 to try the
[2:05:14.520 --> 2:05:19.800]  products and see how amazing they are and i believe you will then get hooked on them like
[2:05:19.800 --> 2:05:25.960]  myself my family and the crew are so again both these products are back in stock both x3 and one
[2:05:25.960 --> 2:05:32.760]  or son they are 50 off for a limited time because they're going to sell out at this price i would
[2:05:32.760 --> 2:05:38.680]  estimate in less than a month so this is your chance to get x3 and experience the good halogens
[2:05:38.680 --> 2:05:43.400]  versus the bad halogens this is your chance to have the highest quality vitamin d3 with vitamin k

[2:05:47.880 --> 2:05:54.360]  this is 360 win is it funds the operation i need funds to run the operation you need to be healthy
[2:05:54.360 --> 2:06:05.480]  we need to stay on air it's a match made in heaven you are either with the republic or against it
[2:06:06.600 --> 2:06:12.600]  resistance to titans is obedience to god it's alex jones
[2:06:17.480 --> 2:06:23.960]  well she's been an amazing white house correspondent for newsmax and oan i'm a big fan of both
[2:06:23.960 --> 2:06:30.600]  newsmax and oan oan's more hardcore than newsmax i've known you know chris ruddy for 25 years
[2:06:30.600 --> 2:06:35.720]  interviewed him 25 plus years ago back when he was exposing the clinton so we're not we're not taking
[2:06:36.360 --> 2:06:40.760]  newsmax i think of the woodshed here though i'm very concerned i'm not singling them out
[2:06:40.760 --> 2:06:45.080]  it's just that she worked there and she witnessed some of this and has uh written about it the
[2:06:45.080 --> 2:06:49.880]  blaze broke it last week it's gotten almost no attention it's huge some of the biggest news
[2:06:49.880 --> 2:06:56.760]  the last 26 months of this whole covid power grab exclusive the federal government paid hundreds of
[2:06:56.760 --> 2:07:02.360]  media companies to advertise the covid 19 vaccines all those same outlets provided positive coverage
[2:07:02.360 --> 2:07:07.640]  of the vaccines and wouldn't allow their hosts to even question it it turns out and cover up the
[2:07:07.640 --> 2:07:14.280]  danger of the shots and then emerald robinson who now of course is doing a great job over at franc
[2:07:14.280 --> 2:07:19.800]  speech dot com with her own show where she's not being censored she came out with a big article on
[2:07:19.800 --> 2:07:26.440]  her substack where she wrote about this everybody should go read it fox news and newsmax took biden
[2:07:26.440 --> 2:07:33.800]  money to push deadly covid vaccines to its viewers find her on substack at emerald robinson and of
[2:07:33.800 --> 2:07:39.720]  course on the very popular frank speech and all the great work that mr lindell is helping get on
[2:07:39.720 --> 2:07:46.920]  the air reaching millions a day so well congratulations on exposing this and staying true and wow it's
[2:07:46.920 --> 2:07:52.600]  great to have you here very very scary story you give us a really an inside view into how this was
[2:07:52.600 --> 2:07:57.400]  going on what happened and while we saw some of the hosts fired over at newsmax who would just
[2:07:57.400 --> 2:08:03.640]  mildly criticize both election fraud and the vaccines and so thank you so much for joining us
[2:08:03.640 --> 2:08:10.520]  where should we start emerald thanks so much alex for having me i really appreciate it as you said
[2:08:10.520 --> 2:08:17.080]  this is a very scary story because this is the definition of propaganda the government giving
[2:08:17.080 --> 2:08:23.480]  corporate media and small let's not even say the big corporate media entities but also small
[2:08:23.480 --> 2:08:32.040]  entities uh money to push the company line that these vaccines were safe and effective that is
[2:08:32.040 --> 2:08:37.560]  propaganda and one of the the the biggest propaganda campaigns i would say of all time outside of
[2:08:37.560 --> 2:08:44.280]  some of the war effort now to catch up your viewers if they didn't see the news last week the blaze
[2:08:45.000 --> 2:08:50.360]  was able to confirm really great reporting investigative reporting on the part of chris
[2:08:50.360 --> 2:08:57.400]  tendoffo for the blaze via a four-year request what i had been told by insiders at a couple
[2:08:57.400 --> 2:09:03.240]  network networks uh that these corporate media outlets these media outlets were getting money
[2:09:03.240 --> 2:09:08.840]  in order to provide positive coverage of the vaccines via uh covid relief funds that were
[2:09:08.840 --> 2:09:14.920]  provided through the health and human services department now in this four-year request it listed
[2:09:14.920 --> 2:09:18.440]  several different outlets the ones you would normally expect right and their audience would
[2:09:18.440 --> 2:09:23.720]  be okay with their probably by and large that'd be msnbc the washington post the la times the
[2:09:23.720 --> 2:09:29.160]  daily beast but there were two in particular that were most concerning i think for viewers of these
[2:09:29.160 --> 2:09:37.320]  audiences and that was fox and newsmax were on the list now wopo and the la times have suggested
[2:09:37.320 --> 2:09:44.360]  oh well this was just psd the government buying psd and well we know that's not true as is evidence
[2:09:44.360 --> 2:09:49.880]  in the coverage of every outlet including fox and newsmax which were very complimentary of the
[2:09:49.880 --> 2:09:54.760]  the vaccines they put out statements saying that their position was that they are safe and effective
[2:09:54.760 --> 2:10:00.520]  despite all this evidence that had been coming out for months that contradicted that in fact the
[2:10:00.520 --> 2:10:07.480]  networks unbooked medical professionals legitimate medical professionals uh doctors uh
[2:10:07.480 --> 2:10:13.720]  vaccinologists immune immunologists that expressed concerns about the vaccine and we're trying to
[2:10:13.720 --> 2:10:19.560]  promote more therapeutic public relations people were calling me from all over dc and i know you
[2:10:19.560 --> 2:10:23.000]  know those people because they reached out they try to get their guestbooks and they were just in
[2:10:23.000 --> 2:10:28.760]  shock that kermit conservative entities were treating them this way despite legitimate concerns
[2:10:28.760 --> 2:10:35.000]  and facts and data about the vaccines and as you noted we started to see anchors television
[2:10:35.000 --> 2:10:41.720]  anchors i can think of one in particular an evening news host who uh was pulled off his own show
[2:10:41.720 --> 2:10:46.360]  once he uh tweeted that he would not comply with the mandate and then of course there's the great
[2:10:46.360 --> 2:10:53.560]  laura logan who has not really i don't think she's been on fox again after voicing criticism
[2:10:53.560 --> 2:10:59.320]  for dr tony phalagy who if you will notice now that the Pfizer documents have done with nine pages
[2:10:59.320 --> 2:11:05.800]  of side effect isn't out there on the media all day like he has been for the last two years he's
[2:11:05.800 --> 2:11:12.440]  in hiding you know that's a great point about laura logan she gets up there and says what everybody
[2:11:12.440 --> 2:11:17.160]  knew to be the truth about these vaccines aren't working they're causing health problems uh they're
[2:11:17.160 --> 2:11:23.400]  bullying people to take them and this is violating the nuremberg code and boom she is off fox and the
[2:11:23.400 --> 2:11:31.720]  word is basically was let go there but that's a badge of honor uh to be uh uh uh basically can
[2:11:31.720 --> 2:11:37.480]  because you couldn't be bought yeah very much so and i think this is important to point out for
[2:11:37.480 --> 2:11:45.720]  the audience alex is that these these networks these these media outlets were taking this money
[2:11:45.720 --> 2:11:50.440]  providing this kind of coverage and if you go back with uh this lens now when you look at some of the
[2:11:50.440 --> 2:11:55.720]  previous coverage it makes more sense to you what you were seeing on tv or in print they took this
[2:11:55.720 --> 2:12:02.360]  money but they didn't disclose it to their to their audience they had no idea that they were getting
[2:12:02.360 --> 2:12:07.000]  money from the government to promote these vaccines a lot of people thought they were
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:14.760]  watching unbiased news so that is a huge that is that's one of that is breaking the biggest
[2:12:14.760 --> 2:12:20.840]  rule in journalism it is propaganda and i'll also say that it wasn't just you know the audience
[2:12:21.400 --> 2:12:28.440]  that was uh in the dark about this money uh most of the i think of the networks the different
[2:12:28.440 --> 2:12:35.720]  networks the majority of on-air talent or producers were unaware of this deal from hhs as well so
[2:12:35.720 --> 2:12:41.240]  that's like that's problematic and i know that you know reporters myself included were asked to
[2:12:41.240 --> 2:12:46.840]  be careful about what we said about the vaccines both on-air and in our social media posts suggesting
[2:12:46.840 --> 2:12:52.920]  it could be problematic and now we understand that we have the context of that uh a little better now
[2:12:52.920 --> 2:12:58.200]  well that's right that happened uh ivory hecker at fox in texas is she was talking to people that
[2:12:58.200 --> 2:13:02.040]  were getting sick people that didn't like the shot nurses and things and doctors were being
[2:13:02.040 --> 2:13:06.600]  pressured to be fired if they didn't take it and they said listen we got sponsors and she's like
[2:13:06.600 --> 2:13:10.520]  well who are these sponsors well we're not going to talk about it but now we know it wasn't just
[2:13:10.520 --> 2:13:16.360]  big pharma it was the government coming in and giving taxpayer money to that local popular station
[2:13:16.360 --> 2:13:23.800]  in houston so that they would again control the narrative exactly and not only did you have outlets
[2:13:23.800 --> 2:13:29.800]  doing that but in the case of fox and back in december they even uh i've seen the emails uh
[2:13:29.800 --> 2:13:36.040]  from former or in current fox employees that they uh that they would pay their employees
[2:13:36.040 --> 2:13:41.240]  five hundred dollars if they would give proof of vaccination status so not only were they taking
[2:13:41.240 --> 2:13:46.040]  the money uh doing some positive coverage they were also paying their paying their employees
[2:13:46.040 --> 2:13:50.280]  five hundred dollars if they would take the vaccine yet we saw what they would say in their
[2:13:50.280 --> 2:13:56.440]  opinion led shows particularly about uh being critical of mandates or not giving people the
[2:13:56.440 --> 2:14:01.800]  choice and this is what they were doing behind the scenes wow you know i've got so many questions
[2:14:01.800 --> 2:14:07.880]  for you but reading your article on substack you talk about some of the things that you witnessed
[2:14:07.880 --> 2:14:15.320]  inside newsmax how were they trying to control the narrative there well i would say it's the
[2:14:15.320 --> 2:14:22.520]  same as we saw at a lot of the other networks uh in that there was a control of which a guest came
[2:14:22.520 --> 2:14:27.960]  on if you'll look back at the coverage you didn't see a guest that were the medical experts that
[2:14:27.960 --> 2:14:32.200]  were more critical of the vaccine thought perhaps the vaccines were terrible shouldn't
[2:14:32.920 --> 2:14:37.720]  highlighted the the concerning data that we were seeing in israel particularly remember
[2:14:37.720 --> 2:14:43.160]  over uh the the late summer months and early fall it was becoming very clear in israel that
[2:14:43.160 --> 2:14:48.760]  these two shots then by then for israel free shot vaccines were not working and in fact it appeared
[2:14:48.760 --> 2:14:54.600]  to be uh increasing the spread of the virus and there was already reports of severe side effects
[2:14:54.600 --> 2:14:59.960]  there there were lots of uh vaccine injured people in america who just didn't get to go on
[2:14:59.960 --> 2:15:05.320]  television and tell their story they were told that you know the networks weren't interested in it
[2:15:05.320 --> 2:15:11.000]  so we saw that basically across the board at every network but like i said it's more concerning
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:14.840]  for i think conservative viewers of networks they feel that they can trust
[2:15:14.840 --> 2:15:21.640]  us than maybe the msnbc viewers who are probably fine with this to be honest emerald i've got a
[2:15:21.640 --> 2:15:24.600]  hundred different questions for you and we're about to go to break but when we come back
[2:15:25.720 --> 2:15:28.760]  what's front and center for you what are you going to hit when we come back
[2:15:31.880 --> 2:15:35.320]  we could talk more about what i think we're going to see i think we're going to learn
[2:15:35.320 --> 2:15:42.680]  more entities that probably got money for the vaccines influencers uh i will tell you that
[2:15:42.680 --> 2:15:48.840]  there is more information that we should know for instance that's exactly where i was going
[2:15:48.840 --> 2:15:53.160]  because we know this is just the tip of the iceberg stay right there folks we'll be right back
[2:15:57.480 --> 2:16:02.920]  so i did it i signed up for the austin marathon i've been training probably not as much as they
[2:16:02.920 --> 2:16:08.520]  should be but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for info wars store dot com before i set
[2:16:08.520 --> 2:16:14.200]  out on a run i throw down some turbo force to give me that energy i need to get going you know
[2:16:14.200 --> 2:16:20.440]  besides the energy turbo force it is giving me the vitamins i need like vitamin c to keep me healthy
[2:16:20.440 --> 2:16:25.320]  and the essential b vitamins plus the amino acids for sustained energy giving me the best
[2:16:25.320 --> 2:16:31.400]  chance at getting through the training and then every day now i'm taking dr jones sore less i have
[2:16:31.400 --> 2:16:36.760]  bad joints thanks mom so this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now
[2:16:36.760 --> 2:16:43.000]  plus inflammation support and extra flexibility the quick release capsules help me recover fast
[2:16:43.000 --> 2:16:48.440]  so i can get back to the training even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon good news
[2:16:48.440 --> 2:16:53.480]  turbo force that can still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day and sore less can
[2:16:53.480 --> 2:16:58.200]  keep you moving and feeling great at any age the average person on the face of this incredible
[2:16:58.200 --> 2:17:04.760]  planet is still unaware that there's a war between free individuals and nation states on one side
[2:17:04.760 --> 2:17:10.120]  and the globalist on the other who are literally trying to create a post human world for the
[2:17:10.120 --> 2:17:15.080]  united states of brazil and of course triggered by the brakes in the uk nations were pulling out of
[2:17:15.080 --> 2:17:20.280]  the private corporate fascist world government that's why they launched their great reset and
[2:17:20.280 --> 2:17:26.920]  their program after collapsing us of build back better this is nothing more than a top down
[2:17:27.560 --> 2:17:32.680]  vertical consolidation of the world economy because they couldn't take our guns because we
[2:17:32.680 --> 2:17:37.880]  wouldn't bow because the left which is the ideology of this world government system couldn't win
[2:17:38.760 --> 2:17:44.680]  they released a biological weapon on us now we know two years ago we learned about it about
[2:17:44.680 --> 2:17:49.160]  20 months ago it's that simple they can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns
[2:17:49.720 --> 2:17:53.960]  so the global corporate combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest is history
[2:17:53.960 --> 2:17:58.760]  expose this paradigm and we win micah california thanks for calling i think we're barking up the
[2:17:58.760 --> 2:18:04.920]  wrong tree calling this gain of function research now if you read the actual you know 2014 legislation
[2:18:04.920 --> 2:18:11.160]  the u.s government gain of function deliberative process and research funding pause on selected
[2:18:11.160 --> 2:18:15.560]  gain of function research involving influenza mers and stars viruses there's nothing about
[2:18:15.560 --> 2:18:21.080]  stars like viruses and it's a research funding pause it's not a stop it's not a prohibition
[2:18:21.080 --> 2:18:25.400]  it's when you come to a four-way intersection there's the stops on you stop you look both ways
[2:18:25.400 --> 2:18:30.600]  and then you proceed and so it's also it doesn't pause all gain of function just selected gain of
[2:18:30.600 --> 2:18:35.560]  function but they'll argue that this is actually characterization and qualification research
[2:18:35.560 --> 2:18:39.240]  so you know rand and the others you know maybe fouchy was right they don't quite know what
[2:18:39.240 --> 2:18:42.920]  they're talking about calling it gain of function you know that's why he didn't perjure himself
[2:18:42.920 --> 2:18:47.320]  that's why he hasn't been arrested because they're literally creating new synthetic live forms that
[2:18:47.320 --> 2:18:51.960]  mimic what the viruses do but in the main definition it's still a gain of function you're
[2:18:51.960 --> 2:18:56.200]  making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people thank you mike we love you it's
[2:18:56.200 --> 2:19:01.880]  time to protect your privacy it's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't
[2:19:01.880 --> 2:19:09.080]  have anything to hide criminals hackers corporations big tech government are stealing all of your data
[2:19:09.080 --> 2:19:14.120]  and creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do so in the future under their

[2:20:04.520 --> 2:20:19.400]  coming up at the last few minutes of this hour before rogestone joins us big developments in
[2:20:19.400 --> 2:20:24.200]  russia with the ukraine conflict they've agreed to meet in turkey we also have
[2:20:26.680 --> 2:20:31.480]  some really bizarre news with britney spears coming out about forced blood transfusions and
[2:20:31.480 --> 2:20:35.480]  things out in hollywood we're going to be talking about some of that there's a lot of news
[2:20:36.040 --> 2:20:42.360]  upon info wars.com and also a mtg interview that we did that we haven't aired yet that just went
[2:20:42.360 --> 2:20:49.240]  live where she gets into the mask and so much more that's now at info wars.com emerald robinson
[2:20:49.240 --> 2:20:54.120]  is again a journalist she's been a white house correspondent for newsmax and oen she now does
[2:20:54.120 --> 2:20:59.080]  a show over at frankspeech.com where she's not being censored and of course she writes for
[2:20:59.080 --> 2:21:04.920]  substack at emerald robinson you can find it right there and she has been giving us an inside
[2:21:04.920 --> 2:21:10.360]  scoop on how the censorship and control was going on at one of the outlets newsmax that was
[2:21:10.360 --> 2:21:14.600]  taking the money not just abc not just cbs and during the break i was saying what's the big
[2:21:14.600 --> 2:21:19.560]  angle here and she was going to get into it right now dealing with how deep the rabbit hole goes
[2:21:19.560 --> 2:21:25.000]  what the other shoes are that are about to drop so again thank you for joining us and lay that out
[2:21:25.000 --> 2:21:29.640]  for us because clearly they don't want us to know how much money each one of these outlets was getting
[2:21:31.000 --> 2:21:36.440]  no they don't and a source who was familiar with the foyer request conducted by the blaze
[2:21:36.440 --> 2:21:42.280]  as the documents that contain said that the information about exactly the exact amount that
[2:21:42.280 --> 2:21:51.000]  each media outlet got was not contained in the documents that was redacted now the hhs cited a
[2:21:51.000 --> 2:21:59.800]  trade secrets provision as the reason that they did that now i don't think that makes a lot of
[2:21:59.800 --> 2:22:04.040]  sense because that's not giving away any kind of trade secrets it's formulation or product
[2:22:04.040 --> 2:22:09.080]  ingredients or or sequencing or anything like that it literally is just the amount of money
[2:22:09.080 --> 2:22:15.800]  in a propaganda campaign a pr campaign for the vaccines that each network got i think it would
[2:22:15.800 --> 2:22:21.240]  it be who's these audience the public to get that information because yeah even if it's just one dollar
[2:22:21.240 --> 2:22:25.640]  dollar alex and they took it and they did a positive coverage that's still problematic but
[2:22:25.640 --> 2:22:31.880]  i think if we saw the mon the monetary amount it would probably be quite surprising to americans
[2:22:31.880 --> 2:22:38.200]  and to audience also what people didn't realize is how widespread this campaign went i was shocked
[2:22:38.200 --> 2:22:44.360]  when i learned certain small tiny tiny things tanks that you don't even see as having much influence
[2:22:44.360 --> 2:22:48.280]  got some of this money and it was very disappointed just disappointing to some of the people who
[2:22:48.280 --> 2:22:54.360]  worked with these tiny thing tanks but i'll also say lots of important people lots of public figures
[2:22:54.360 --> 2:23:01.720]  who have strong followings and huge audience and bait audience bases also got these uh got some
[2:23:01.720 --> 2:23:07.000]  of these funds certain people and that was not released as part of this uh boy you're done as
[2:23:07.000 --> 2:23:10.440]  well well that's what i got from the blaze article and then when yours expanded into the
[2:23:10.440 --> 2:23:16.200]  document says this is just a small amount of billion plus dollars this is government we
[2:23:16.200 --> 2:23:21.560]  know that big pharma put out billions and billions from basketball stars and movie stars right down
[2:23:21.560 --> 2:23:27.160]  to youtubers with just a few thousand followers getting thousands of dollars so there was massive
[2:23:27.160 --> 2:23:32.760]  amounts of money going out there to control the narrative exactly if you look at how to control
[2:23:32.760 --> 2:23:37.080]  the narrative was remember two years ago i was called i mean i was called it was very serious
[2:23:37.080 --> 2:23:44.360]  a lot but once in particular uh for talking about how the mRNA vaccines alter your dna well
[2:23:44.360 --> 2:23:48.760]  we're learning even more about that in the last couple weeks and that's just accepted now right
[2:23:48.760 --> 2:23:54.760]  but that's how the technology works it's going to uh permanently in a way change your dna something
[2:23:54.760 --> 2:23:58.920]  they said you were crazy if you talked about before remember when we talked about the origins of
[2:23:58.920 --> 2:24:04.360]  covid you were crazy you were pulled off facebook my my posts were were censored and pulled off
[2:24:04.360 --> 2:24:09.800]  facebook i still can't actually post on facebook and as you know i was banned on my twitter account
[2:24:09.800 --> 2:24:16.200]  for tweets and a sub stack that i did that to this day has not been really proven false no one is
[2:24:16.200 --> 2:24:20.840]  has proven me false and if well that was my next question for you how do you think i meant to ask
[2:24:20.840 --> 2:24:24.440]  that up front how does it feel to be totally vindicated because you were censored all over the
[2:24:24.440 --> 2:24:28.600]  place and attacked for doing really good research and interviewing a lot of experts you've been
[2:24:28.600 --> 2:24:33.640]  vindicated they now admit it's not a vaccine it doesn't really protect you uh after eight months
[2:24:33.640 --> 2:24:38.600]  you have less immune system you had before so that's a negative effect i mean they now want
[2:24:38.600 --> 2:24:44.200]  us to kind of forget about the last two years and move on to the ukrainian war uh but what
[2:24:44.200 --> 2:24:51.640]  happens to all the people that were blacklisted like you for simply questioning it nothing nothing
[2:24:51.640 --> 2:24:57.160]  changes for them just because i'm right in fact it's actually in some ways more problematic for them
[2:24:57.160 --> 2:25:02.840]  uh because they did be platform me because they have tried to do media smear campaigns
[2:25:03.480 --> 2:25:09.560]  about me and so they'd rather try to continue to do that and keep me as a conspiracy theorist
[2:25:09.560 --> 2:25:15.160]  even though on nearly any level i can think of i've been vindicated to this point and i don't
[2:25:15.160 --> 2:25:23.960]  say that being vindicated makes me feel better alex because so many people are still hurt by the
[2:25:23.960 --> 2:25:30.760]  misrepresentation of information by false information i just wish it i'd never been
[2:25:31.560 --> 2:25:36.280]  de-platformed or or that i'd never been censored so that people could have gotten the information
[2:25:36.280 --> 2:25:41.480]  in real time because a lot of times these medical experts that i've been talking to all along
[2:25:41.480 --> 2:25:45.640]  they really tried to help people they were trying to get that information out there they lost their
[2:25:45.640 --> 2:25:50.120]  job uh many of them were forced to resign they're not getting their jobs back just because they've
[2:25:50.120 --> 2:25:58.040]  been right now based on what i've heard well again i don't want to call you a hero but you
[2:25:58.040 --> 2:26:03.000]  are a hero and it was george arwell that said in a world of universal deceit telling the truth
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:09.320]  it's a revolutionary act and so many thousands of scientists and doctors and nurses and media people
[2:26:09.320 --> 2:26:15.640]  lost their jobs got persecuted got sued got de-platformed just because we wanted to tell the
[2:26:15.640 --> 2:26:23.880]  world the truth how does it feel to know that there are people working for the system now that are
[2:26:23.880 --> 2:26:29.640]  richer and who consciously now took part in this lie even though it's now confirmed it was all a
[2:26:29.640 --> 2:26:35.240]  big lie and so instead of you being vindicated they're now fully discredited i wonder how they
[2:26:35.240 --> 2:26:41.800]  feel or i wonder if they have any conscience well i've been around these people for a long time now
[2:26:41.800 --> 2:26:47.560]  now alex i i i've covered the white house i covered the white house and dc politics for
[2:26:47.560 --> 2:26:52.440]  about five years and then it was a busy five years as you know the trump years and then
[2:26:52.440 --> 2:26:58.760]  it extended into the biden administration and based on being in national media and sitting
[2:26:58.760 --> 2:27:05.160]  with those people day in and day out i can guarantee you a very small percentage if any will fill any
[2:27:05.160 --> 2:27:11.720]  level of remorse in what they did they just won't and they won't change it'll happen again
[2:27:11.720 --> 2:27:18.760]  in the future and that's why it's so important uh to have uncensored outlets uh like like yours
[2:27:18.760 --> 2:27:24.600]  like the one i'm now with uh lindell tv and frank speech dot com where we can give you the news
[2:27:24.600 --> 2:27:31.080]  uncensored we don't have to worry about where the money is coming from or or who who's this quote
[2:27:31.080 --> 2:27:37.240]  unquote sponsored that is so important and of course it's exploded we're really excited to see
[2:27:37.240 --> 2:27:43.560]  that lindell tv and frank speech is doing so well that's why he's a hero uh you know just because
[2:27:43.560 --> 2:27:47.720]  he was so optimistic and i warned him that they weren't going to overturn this criminal election
[2:27:47.720 --> 2:27:53.960]  quickly uh being optimistic is not a crime but the the funding and the things he's done boosting
[2:27:53.960 --> 2:27:58.840]  thousands of independent media voices and hundreds of prominent ones like you that have been censored
[2:27:58.840 --> 2:28:04.840]  that's why the work he does is so important and he's the hardest worker i've ever met i thought
[2:28:04.840 --> 2:28:11.720]  that i stayed busy and worked hard that man gets i'm not sure when he probably sleeps because he
[2:28:11.720 --> 2:28:18.520]  is going day in and day out around the country to try to highlight the truth to try to uh fight for
[2:28:18.520 --> 2:28:24.040]  american freedoms and like you said i am very thankful for him to give me uh this platform
[2:28:24.040 --> 2:28:29.640]  my show the absolute truth uh with emerald robinson will start next week on frank speech dot com
[2:28:29.640 --> 2:28:37.400]  uh and lindell tv at nine a.m and look we're going to try to just grow this even more where we
[2:28:37.400 --> 2:28:42.600]  bring you more news more facts more information that you just won't see on the out there on the
[2:28:42.600 --> 2:28:47.000]  media and i can tell you in the corporate media and i can tell you that this is just the beginning

[2:31:54.200 --> 2:32:00.280]  inflation is exploding so when i first started taking survival skill basically i was 275 pounds
[2:32:00.280 --> 2:32:05.640]  i was overweight i had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely holding on to a job and i
[2:32:05.640 --> 2:32:10.120]  heard dr. grip on your show and i listened to it so the first one i got was the original survival
[2:32:10.120 --> 2:32:14.920]  shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with x2 you had
[2:32:14.920 --> 2:32:18.520]  you know with a deep burden source you know and i got really excited about that so i took it and
[2:32:18.520 --> 2:32:25.000]  man in two weeks i went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you know
[2:32:25.000 --> 2:32:30.360]  i could think again i could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of
[2:32:30.360 --> 2:32:35.160]  years i got my health back and i religiously took basically all of your supplements they're all

[2:32:48.920 --> 2:32:53.800]  our own health into our own hands beautifully said brother i thank you so much for your call and god
[2:32:53.800 --> 2:33:07.800]  speed leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:33:07.800 --> 2:33:23.320]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[2:33:25.240 --> 2:33:30.360]  well investigative journalist reporter widehouse correspondent for newsmax and oen now works at
[2:33:30.360 --> 2:33:36.280]  frank speaks dot com emerald robinson sears she also has her own sub stack writes amazing articles
[2:33:36.280 --> 2:33:43.400]  we link to a lot of them info wars dot com she was just confirming what came out in this big blaze
[2:33:43.400 --> 2:33:49.240]  report with a foyer request that over a billion dollars and just one program was paid uh in the
[2:33:49.240 --> 2:33:54.520]  last year under the bite administration to the media to then put out favorable stories for the
[2:33:54.520 --> 2:34:03.240]  vaccine that ladies and gentlemen is so dangerous and i think it's illegal it's not just unethical
[2:34:03.240 --> 2:34:07.960]  but to take taxpayer money and then give it to the corporate media and have it be a secret and
[2:34:07.960 --> 2:34:13.000]  now these companies claim trade secrets to protect what they're doing this needs to be stopped but
[2:34:13.720 --> 2:34:19.960]  emerald where is congress where are the republicans because they had controlled for the first two years
[2:34:20.520 --> 2:34:24.920]  when trump was out of the house and senate they didn't stop the censorship they didn't stop
[2:34:24.920 --> 2:34:30.280]  the stay behind networks that obama put in to quote counter foreign disinformation
[2:34:30.280 --> 2:34:35.160]  which the democrats still control these billions of dollars to launch censorship operations inside
[2:34:35.160 --> 2:34:41.480]  america by labeling us all russian agents i mean this has been a systematic tyranny we've been
[2:34:41.480 --> 2:34:48.360]  witnessing and now we've got uh reports here uh that i'm gonna cover this next hour roger stone's on
[2:34:48.360 --> 2:34:55.320]  that people are being held for weeks and weeks and weeks for months for eight weeks without even
[2:34:55.320 --> 2:35:01.000]  being charged in january six now which is a federal crime violates habeas corpus i mean
[2:35:01.000 --> 2:35:06.040]  the democrats and these big corporations it seems like are just going for broke on every front
[2:35:06.040 --> 2:35:12.920]  and trampling every basic right we have because they know they can alice because you hit the
[2:35:12.920 --> 2:35:19.400]  nail on the head there where are the republicans we've been saying that trump was uh what trump
[2:35:19.400 --> 2:35:23.320]  with the flashlight and i say this often for institutions in every way whether it was the
[2:35:23.320 --> 2:35:31.080]  doj the fbi the do d the nsc he exposed the corruption in nearly every institution that
[2:35:31.080 --> 2:35:37.480]  we had academia but he also exposed who republicans really were and besides a handful
[2:35:38.200 --> 2:35:43.720]  alec they're largely the same as democrats and that's why democrats are able to do what they
[2:35:43.720 --> 2:35:48.360]  want to do particularly with the january sixth defendants because republicans are too afraid to
[2:35:48.360 --> 2:35:52.040]  go and say anything about it they don't want to be aligned with these people that they
[2:35:52.040 --> 2:35:57.160]  see as conspiracy theorists and in many ways remember when they did have the majority senate
[2:35:57.160 --> 2:36:02.840]  majority leader mitch mcconnell was was active in blocking so many trump initiatives himself
[2:36:02.840 --> 2:36:08.120]  the democrats didn't have to do anything he kept it under control for them also when you
[2:36:08.120 --> 2:36:13.320]  go back to republicans and why they haven't talked or really done anything about censorship
[2:36:13.320 --> 2:36:17.880]  it's another one of those instances where you need to follow the money because so many of them
[2:36:17.880 --> 2:36:24.200]  have big tag donating to their campaigns so many lawmakers have ties with you know
[2:36:24.200 --> 2:36:30.280]  kids getting jobs that's another issue where again you follow the money which it often is
[2:36:30.280 --> 2:36:35.160]  in dc and it's not really about doing the best and uh following the best interest for the american
[2:36:35.160 --> 2:36:41.400]  people and that's both sides there are some good ones there are some but there it's a very small
[2:36:41.400 --> 2:36:46.520]  percentage are you still having to be inside the belly of the bc or have you gone out to the
[2:36:46.520 --> 2:36:54.040]  frank speech headquarters now i have escaped to an undisclosed location i i am in the countryside
[2:36:54.680 --> 2:36:59.640]  somewhere in the united states i'll tell you i'm in virginia but i love virginia i love the
[2:36:59.640 --> 2:37:06.440]  countryside and i am thrilled to death to be outside of dc it is not a good filling place
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:12.920]  you hit belly of the beast is right oh wow i mean the the creepiness and now they want vaccine
[2:37:12.920 --> 2:37:18.120]  passports to go into restaurants and you've got to go to a side window if you don't it's it's like
[2:37:18.120 --> 2:37:22.920]  returning everybody to segregation here it's it's it's apartheid for people that don't take
[2:37:22.920 --> 2:37:28.360]  an experimental shot in their body that completely violates the nuremberg code uh you know just as
[2:37:28.360 --> 2:37:33.400]  many other journalists have pointed out and speaking of segregation particularly when you
[2:37:33.400 --> 2:37:39.640]  look at the district uh it's not the white liberals who live in the district who are
[2:37:39.640 --> 2:37:43.800]  concerned about the vaccine mandates you know they're getting the max vaccine and they're showing
[2:37:43.800 --> 2:37:50.360]  their passport it's by and large uh the the the black population there who are concerned in fact
[2:37:50.360 --> 2:37:55.960]  i would often frequent a couple restaurants who did not tow that line in dc over the last
[2:37:55.960 --> 2:38:02.280]  two years kept their doors open kept their staff on didn't care if you had a mask on or not uh would
[2:38:02.280 --> 2:38:06.040]  serve you and treat you like a human being anyway so we really try to support those restaurants
[2:38:06.040 --> 2:38:10.200]  and i would go in there then you know there were lots of members of the black community there and
[2:38:10.200 --> 2:38:16.840]  they expressed concerns about the vaccine they didn't want to take it and so they're by and large
[2:38:16.840 --> 2:38:21.480]  probably the group getting the most uh discriminated against in this vaccine policy in the district of
[2:38:21.480 --> 2:38:30.440]  columbia there really is segregation and they're setting the precedent to do things that we only
[2:38:30.440 --> 2:38:37.160]  read about at the soviet union or nazi germany or north korea but on a grand scale and i don't see
[2:38:37.160 --> 2:38:44.040]  emerald how big pharma and its incestuous relationship with big tech and dinosaur media
[2:38:44.040 --> 2:38:48.280]  and government gets away with what they've done they're hoping everybody just forgets what they
[2:38:48.280 --> 2:38:53.800]  did the last two years but i don't see that anger going away i think they've really awakened the
[2:38:53.800 --> 2:39:00.760]  sleeping giant and given it a terrible purpose to quote admiro yamamoto they did and particularly
[2:39:00.760 --> 2:39:06.760]  they awakened mama bear right even those who had uh historically the suburban moms a lot of them
[2:39:06.760 --> 2:39:11.560]  who historically supported the or more liberals supported the democrat party you always see the
[2:39:11.560 --> 2:39:16.120]  republicans trying to court them but this ignited them in a way i have had so many women in the
[2:39:16.120 --> 2:39:24.200]  suburban you know dmv region virginia maryland uh area this has completely flipped their politics
[2:39:24.200 --> 2:39:29.160]  they ended up uh campaigning in virginia for glenn yonkin when they'd always been a democrat voter
[2:39:29.160 --> 2:39:33.320]  but they were so appalled with how these policies affected their children their children became
[2:39:33.320 --> 2:39:38.360]  suicidal they were becoming depressed they couldn't learn they were falling behind in education
[2:39:38.360 --> 2:39:43.960]  and they really stoked that bear they're not putting that back in the box these moms have not
[2:39:43.960 --> 2:39:49.080]  forgotten although the media is currently in the mind administration is currently conducting the uh
[2:39:49.080 --> 2:39:54.520]  what i call this look a squirrel tactic right with use russia and ukraine it's all day every day on
[2:39:54.520 --> 2:39:58.920]  every single network it's uh look over there and don't pay attention to what's coming out about the
[2:39:58.920 --> 2:40:04.120]  vaccines and we're not going to pretend like this didn't happen but given the chance again if they
[2:40:04.120 --> 2:40:09.720]  can keep the majority in the midterms look they're not going to let go of this power grab and i think
[2:40:09.720 --> 2:40:16.840]  people truly understand that now back if if they're still the majority come you know after the
[2:40:16.840 --> 2:40:21.320]  november elections this year i think we would could expect to see mass mandates and all these
[2:40:21.320 --> 2:40:26.120]  mandates back again and lockdown well that's my concern is you're not supposed to the
[2:40:26.120 --> 2:40:31.560]  biden says it's an act of terror since last june the official u.s government policy to question
[2:40:31.560 --> 2:40:37.080]  elections to question lockdowns to question these vaccines they're saying that's terrorism
[2:40:37.080 --> 2:40:41.640]  and there's no doubt i i'm really worried they're going to steal the midterms i'm very concerned
[2:40:41.640 --> 2:40:49.000]  about that i i don't see anything and you know i travel a lot now particularly across the nation
[2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:54.760]  that i'm not on the white house beat anymore looking at uh the efforts being made to change it
[2:40:54.760 --> 2:41:00.280]  should not let what happened in 2020 happened in regards to you know breaking the laws on
[2:41:00.280 --> 2:41:07.800]  on voting these massive melon ballot harvesting ballot boxes and those some states have called
[2:41:07.800 --> 2:41:14.280]  it back a little bit it's still more than existed in those kind of measures voting measures ahead
[2:41:14.280 --> 2:41:21.560]  of 2020 and i don't see anything alex that makes me very confident uh that we'll see a better election
[2:41:21.560 --> 2:41:27.640]  process as of right now ahead of 2020 now there's still time what i do find though what i will say
[2:41:27.640 --> 2:41:33.160]  as i travel across the country i do think it's very encouraging is that just your you know just
[2:41:33.160 --> 2:41:39.000]  your average american citizen mom and dad going to work to feed their kids you know put them in
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:44.280]  school make sure they grow up get some sports things get to go to college and become productive
[2:41:44.280 --> 2:41:49.400]  citizens now understand that they can't just sit and let somebody else do it anymore because they
[2:41:49.400 --> 2:41:55.480]  saw who were doing it and what they were doing so more americans are familiar with the process
[2:41:55.480 --> 2:41:59.720]  they understand what happened they know what needs to be done and they're getting more active
[2:41:59.720 --> 2:42:06.440]  in their local communities at their home trying to uh fix things on the ground the level now they
[2:42:06.440 --> 2:42:10.840]  still have some problems even with republican legislatures in some states it's not just democrat
[2:42:10.840 --> 2:42:16.600]  legislatures the republicans as well and that's been an obstacle but i do think it's very encouraging
[2:42:16.600 --> 2:42:22.840]  at how real americans who really care about the country and our freedoms and our future
[2:42:22.840 --> 2:42:27.480]  are getting out there and getting involved in the process i totally agree that's what i'm seeing and
[2:42:27.480 --> 2:42:31.400]  that's why the deep state the democrats are so panicked they're going to pull a lot of tricks
[2:42:31.400 --> 2:42:36.600]  on us but we're aware of it now and so we're definitely living in the second great renaissance
[2:42:36.600 --> 2:42:42.600]  emerald robinson you're going to be launching next monday frankspeech.com at nine a.m is that
[2:42:42.600 --> 2:42:48.440]  central or eastern eastern time all right well i look forward to seeing it and i really appreciate
[2:42:48.440 --> 2:42:52.600]  you joining us hope you'll join us again soon thank you so much absolutely
[2:42:57.480 --> 2:43:02.760]  alex jones here with a very simple proposal for all our great info worth listeners and viewers
[2:43:03.640 --> 2:43:09.560]  if you will simply get x3 with all three types of good iodine that boosts your immune system and

[2:43:27.720 --> 2:43:32.600]  operation now a lot of our products have been sold out and never came back in because the lockdowns
[2:43:32.600 --> 2:43:37.640]  and supply chain breakdowns we were sold out of x3 for a long time and i had it on sale for 50
[2:43:37.640 --> 2:43:41.720]  percent off a lot of folks were getting it and i was thinking you know what i'm going to bring it back
[2:43:41.720 --> 2:43:46.520]  on sale again just until it sells out because even though we won't make as much money in the long
[2:43:46.520 --> 2:43:51.240]  run a lot of folks need this product and we need to get the money from the sales in now to stay on

[2:44:04.520 --> 2:44:10.680]  dinner i like the metropolitan life i like everything that comes with this but see i have
[2:44:10.680 --> 2:44:16.440]  the survival instinct that is to get the hell out of democrat run cities get the hell out of
[2:44:16.440 --> 2:44:22.280]  major metropolitan areas because unless we change course soon it's all crashing down is it time to
[2:44:22.280 --> 2:44:26.280]  just move out to the woods just time to go get a piece of property in the woods and just get off
[2:44:26.280 --> 2:44:30.680]  grid just get the emergency food supplies just live off the land that's the survival instinct but
[2:44:30.680 --> 2:44:35.800]  see the worldly part of me that's still probably the majority part of me says no no no no stay in
[2:44:35.800 --> 2:44:39.880]  the city the survival instinct says get the hell out of anywhere there's ever notion that you need
[2:44:39.880 --> 2:44:45.320]  to get a vaccine or a mask that's the that's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you
[2:44:45.320 --> 2:44:51.560]  in the audience are facing as well but you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency
[2:44:51.560 --> 2:44:58.280]  food supplies and so we have the best ones at infowarstore.com experience the next level and

[2:46:04.840 --> 2:46:11.800]  isn't even the people that die no that invariably follows but first there is the crackdown on
[2:46:12.360 --> 2:46:19.640]  populations basic liberty and speech and massive censorship and now across the world from the
[2:46:19.640 --> 2:46:28.280]  united states to europe legislation is being introduced that if you amplify any quote pro
[2:46:28.280 --> 2:46:35.800]  russian information you can be censored you can be arrested you can be imprisoned and of course now

[2:46:48.600 --> 2:46:53.560]  the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around the world against humanity

[2:47:46.680 --> 2:47:58.840]  over the country and we are back ladies and gentlemen we have huge breaking russia news
[2:47:59.480 --> 2:48:04.840]  latimer putin and their foreign minister labroth our warning of a global collapse in the world
[2:48:04.840 --> 2:48:11.000]  economy basically that described as the great reset if this war continues now we have russia
[2:48:11.000 --> 2:48:15.560]  ukraine agreed a turkey meeting will give you details of all this the pakistani prime minister
[2:48:15.560 --> 2:48:20.600]  comes out and says are we your slaves when europe and the u.s. orders them to basically declare
[2:48:20.600 --> 2:48:25.880]  their enemies with russia russia ceases control of another of the big nuclear power plants russia
[2:48:25.880 --> 2:48:32.840]  says that they've caught the globalist back ukrainian forces trying to stage terror attacks with
[2:48:32.840 --> 2:48:38.760]  dirty bombs to blame on the russians we'll break it all down here in just a moment and then something
[2:48:38.760 --> 2:48:45.560]  that really is a bird's eye view into the evil and and what we know goes on in hollywood and other
[2:48:45.560 --> 2:48:53.560]  places britney spears is saying she was forced to work like a slave and forced drug and forced to
[2:48:53.560 --> 2:49:00.360]  take blood transfusions weekly now everything she said so far has turned out to be true
[2:49:02.920 --> 2:49:06.680]  and we know that that's the type of thing that they that the elites do themselves
[2:49:06.680 --> 2:49:13.560]  so it's just it's just out of control that story is up on info wars dot com by jamie white you
[2:49:13.560 --> 2:49:16.920]  definitely want to go read that just get a bird's eye view of these people i have a marjorie taylor
[2:49:16.920 --> 2:49:25.560]  green clip that i want to play it's just a short little clip and when we're out at dinner when she
[2:49:25.560 --> 2:49:32.040]  was here a few weeks ago i convinced her that she really needs to do it and i'm excited and i put
[2:49:32.040 --> 2:49:37.320]  her in contact with folks that know how to do it for very easily uh and so i'm not bragging i'm just
[2:49:37.320 --> 2:49:42.760]  saying it's that spurring people for her to start doing her own daily podcast whether it's 10 minutes
[2:49:42.760 --> 2:49:48.200]  longer an hour long that will go super viral and exciting so so she's here to you're basically in
[2:49:48.200 --> 2:49:53.000]  this tape uh to uh you know announces she's gonna be launching a podcast very very soon and i think
[2:49:53.000 --> 2:49:58.600]  that's the answer is everybody creating their own operation that's why i'm promoting frank
[2:49:58.600 --> 2:50:05.000]  speech and lindelton tv uh i'd promote glenn beck now that he's woken up and isn't being a jerk
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:08.920]  and you know lying about me and stuff and people said what are you doing being nice to beck he
[2:50:08.920 --> 2:50:13.960]  stole your stick and lied about you attacked you well now he's not doing that and now he sounds
[2:50:13.960 --> 2:50:18.040]  just like me because the truth is here i want to stop nuclear war and the great reset the new
[2:50:18.040 --> 2:50:23.480]  world order i don't care if glenn beckon chopped my arm off and now he's fighting the new world order
[2:50:23.480 --> 2:50:29.080]  that i'm gonna forgive him because i we've got to come together and beat these people
[2:50:30.680 --> 2:50:34.200]  and i'll be honest with you if we turn the tide against the new world order and it looks like
[2:50:34.200 --> 2:50:38.520]  we're winning for a while i got a great crew i love them to death but i'm killing myself doing
[2:50:38.520 --> 2:50:44.120]  this i mean i eat drink sleep this i've been doing this 28 years i'll keep him full words going
[2:50:44.760 --> 2:50:48.600]  if we turn the tide but i'm not going to be working as hard as i am but instead i'm gonna
[2:50:48.600 --> 2:50:55.240]  double down because i know we are neck and neck with these people and so we need more people on
[2:50:55.240 --> 2:51:00.520]  air and more people speaking out and i can't fund myself without your support i'm just like michael
[2:51:00.520 --> 2:51:06.360]  indell where he goes and sells pillows and sheets and and beds and all these great products and he's
[2:51:06.360 --> 2:51:11.960]  financing i know thousands of little host hundreds of big host and more than 10 huge host and and
[2:51:11.960 --> 2:51:17.400]  bringing people on board like the last lady we had on who's been censored and she's gonna do a great
[2:51:17.400 --> 2:51:22.680]  job and be popular and that's the answer to globalist censorship is more people standing up and speaking
[2:51:22.680 --> 2:51:28.920]  out now i'm quietly over the years helped finance quite a few little things behind the scenes and
[2:51:29.800 --> 2:51:34.680]  done a lot of that and uh we've been so under attack the last few years we've had to cut that back
[2:51:34.680 --> 2:51:39.960]  to almost nothing we had to cut back our reporters traveling around the country uh as much because
[2:51:39.960 --> 2:51:46.040]  you know we've been under censorship and attack and the supply chain breakdowns and all of it uh
[2:51:46.040 --> 2:51:51.240]  but but more than ever info wars has been proven to be accurate and the and the saying alex jones was
[2:51:51.240 --> 2:51:57.400]  right has become a maxim of we know you're lying corporate media we know you're a fraud we know
[2:51:57.400 --> 2:52:02.840]  you're out to get us and we're going to take the person that has been demonized and lied about
[2:52:02.840 --> 2:52:08.360]  and attacked and punished and hold him up as a symbol of our victory over your lies i want to
[2:52:08.360 --> 2:52:12.600]  thank the listeners for that because there's nothing i want more than to beat the globalist
[2:52:12.600 --> 2:52:18.360]  and if they can shut us down so i can't speak so they can fully steal my identity and lie about me
[2:52:18.360 --> 2:52:24.840]  where i can't speak and stand up for myself they believe they can also silence you and then lie
[2:52:24.840 --> 2:52:29.800]  about who you are so we're all in this together and i thank you and i salute you for your prayers
[2:52:29.800 --> 2:52:35.160]  and your support and i want to encourage you to get our bodies ultimate turmeric formula
[2:52:35.160 --> 2:52:39.640]  with 95 percent curcumin oil to nobody else has it's the highest end i went to the top company i
[2:52:39.640 --> 2:52:44.920]  said what's your highest curcumin oil we got one with 75 percent that's the highest anybody
[2:52:44.920 --> 2:52:50.120]  remain i said what's the highest you could go they said 90 percent they came back and said
[2:52:50.120 --> 2:52:55.960]  we can hit 95 percent they all gets tested fda tested all that stuff and this is certified quality
[2:52:55.960 --> 2:53:01.480]  stuff that's why it's so much stronger than their tumor it gets it back in stock and i got a 50
[2:53:01.480 --> 2:53:08.040]  percent off it just to move it to get the money in it's a catch 22 50 off x3 50 percent off winter
[2:53:08.040 --> 2:53:12.680]  sun 40 off brain force ultra that's super fast acting and i love it because it goes away in two
[2:53:12.680 --> 2:53:16.840]  to four hours because you know turbo force and brain force lasts a lot longer than they're great
[2:53:16.840 --> 2:53:20.920]  they're totally different formulas they're all different from each other one is insane energy
[2:53:20.920 --> 2:53:26.280]  10 hours for sporting events pre-workout long-haul truck drivers military you name it most folks only
[2:53:26.280 --> 2:53:30.600]  take half a pack all these different types of natural stimulants that metabolize over a long
[2:53:30.600 --> 2:53:35.480]  period of time some hit quick some hit medium some hit long some hit super long that's the turbo
[2:53:35.480 --> 2:53:40.280]  force then there's brain force plus good strong clean four to five hour six hour depending on the
[2:53:40.280 --> 2:53:46.760]  person new tropic and then brain force ultra is super psychoactive really boosts my thought
[2:53:46.760 --> 2:53:52.280]  processes the next level the amazing what it does unlike any other natural stimulant out there
[2:53:52.280 --> 2:53:56.200]  what's got it in this formula but then it dissipates for me in about two and a half hours other folks
[2:53:56.760 --> 2:54:01.720]  two three four five hours but i can take it at seven at night and go to bed at 10 30 can't do that
[2:54:01.720 --> 2:54:05.880]  with turbo force or brain force that those are morning type deals or you got to work really
[2:54:05.880 --> 2:54:11.320]  late noontime deals so it's available 40 off of that funds the operation it's sold out on the first
[2:54:11.320 --> 2:54:17.080]  two runs you got a third run in and it's amazing you should really experience it here's some of what
[2:54:17.080 --> 2:54:31.560]  uh mtg had to say out at dinner a few weeks ago we're now breaking this information
[2:54:33.320 --> 2:54:36.760]  marjorie you were telling me about what it's like to be forced to wear a gag
[2:54:37.320 --> 2:54:42.920]  in congress the fines you paid me yeah so i don't wear a mask when i'm in congress and
[2:54:42.920 --> 2:54:50.440]  Nancy Pelosi finds me $2,500 every day that i don't wear a mask on the house floor and so i have
[2:54:50.440 --> 2:54:58.040]  over 100,000 in mass fines for refusing to wear the piece of cloth over my face that does nothing
[2:54:58.040 --> 2:55:02.520]  how do they do that when when she's out in public she gets caught not wearing it oh but it doesn't
[2:55:02.520 --> 2:55:07.480]  matter because she's Nancy Pelosi obviously she's a hypocrite and that's why i call her the queen
[2:55:08.120 --> 2:55:12.200]  in the house of hypocrites of course it was the famous video year and a half hold of her getting
[2:55:12.200 --> 2:55:16.440]  her hair done with no mask right has that been brought up to her the science that says you
[2:55:16.440 --> 2:55:23.000]  must test trade trace treat you must wear your mask you must have sanitation you must wear your
[2:55:23.000 --> 2:55:29.800]  mask you must wear your mask oh yeah but she ignores it so that's why i'm suing her in court
[2:55:29.800 --> 2:55:36.200]  because she also doesn't wear a mask at times on the house floor and she doesn't get fined she
[2:55:36.200 --> 2:55:41.000]  doesn't pay the fines but yet they take the money straight out of my check so i work for free in
[2:55:41.000 --> 2:55:46.120]  congress because they take all my money away wow but you're standing for us right so they make
[2:55:46.120 --> 2:55:50.600]  children wear them in school still but the teachers themselves are now exempt in many areas this is
[2:55:50.600 --> 2:55:55.800]  the second yeah that's right so the communist teachers in the teacher union that forced children
[2:55:55.800 --> 2:56:01.880]  to wear masks and affect their education their ability to have speech to learn from their teacher
[2:56:01.880 --> 2:56:07.080]  to be able to see others faces to share joy with one another on the playground in the classroom
[2:56:07.080 --> 2:56:13.320]  yeah those people want to mask your children but they don't want to wear them wow i hear
[2:56:13.320 --> 2:56:19.240]  you're launching a podcast sir i am launching a podcast so i can tell all what goes on in
[2:56:19.240 --> 2:56:24.200]  washington oh they won't like that free speech they hate free speech that's why they want to
[2:56:24.200 --> 2:56:28.600]  cancel us but i think we'll make sure that it gets out you're a very bad american we love you
[2:56:31.240 --> 2:56:36.040]  i like her boy i like her a lot all right we're going to go to break i'll be five
[2:56:36.040 --> 2:56:40.680]  minutes on russia and then roger stone joins us with a lot of the he's been spending a lot of
[2:56:40.680 --> 2:56:45.480]  time with trump and he's got some good news some bad news and then we're also going to respond
[2:56:45.480 --> 2:56:50.520]  to just some of the insanity i mean four page articles full page articles the washington post
[2:56:50.520 --> 2:56:56.280]  calling for his arrest new york times article says you know i need to be arrested too i mean they
[2:56:56.280 --> 2:57:02.200]  are just foaming at the mouth to put us in jail claiming we wanted to overthrow the government
[2:57:02.200 --> 2:57:07.320]  on january 6 and we wanted to protest the fraudulent election to get a 10-day legal investigation
[2:57:07.320 --> 2:57:11.880]  in the senate the democrats said they weren't going to accept the election we're going to
[2:57:11.880 --> 2:57:17.800]  frog march trump out with troops even to be won and that they were quote Pelosi and all them said
[2:57:17.800 --> 2:57:23.560]  this uh not going to accept even to be one to have their own inauguration of biden somewhere else
[2:57:24.760 --> 2:57:28.760]  and they told us there'd be a red mirage with the mail-in ballots would save the day i mean this
[2:57:28.760 --> 2:57:33.160]  is a group of criminals that want to outlaw us questioning the fact that they stole the election
[2:57:33.160 --> 2:57:38.680]  well guess what we're not gonna shut up you dirty globalist criminals that have shut down our energy
[2:57:38.680 --> 2:57:42.840]  and are buying russian oil while we go bankrupt you globalist trash
[2:57:47.000 --> 2:57:54.200]  it's hard to believe that we're already into march 2022 and in the month of february we had a very
[2:57:54.200 --> 2:58:01.960]  popular sale that was going of our flagship product x3 that has all three types of the amazing iodine
[2:58:01.960 --> 2:58:08.680]  your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity in your body your immune system your
[2:58:08.680 --> 2:58:14.920]  stamina your levito so much and the majority of the population of the world is iodine deficient
[2:58:14.920 --> 2:58:20.360]  this is the very best iodine output so we had on cell 50% off but we sold more than half of what we
[2:58:20.360 --> 2:58:25.800]  have or isn't going to come in for a long time so i took it back to full process i was just thinking
[2:58:25.800 --> 2:58:30.600]  you know what we need the funds in now to stay on air plus this is the right product everybody
[2:58:30.600 --> 2:58:35.400]  needs so incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get x3 and experience with
[2:58:35.400 --> 2:58:41.640]  yourself and support the broadcast i'm going to keep it at 50 off until it sells out get x3 right
[2:58:41.640 --> 2:58:50.600]  now exclusively at infowarstore.com or 50 off so i did it i signed up for the austin marathon i've
[2:58:50.600 --> 2:58:55.800]  been training probably not as much as they should be but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness
[2:58:55.800 --> 2:59:02.520]  for info wars store.com before i start out on a run i throw down some turbo force to give me that
[2:59:02.520 --> 2:59:08.280]  energy i need to get going you know besides the energy turbo force it is giving me the vitamins i

[2:59:13.560 --> 2:59:18.280]  sustained energy giving me the best chance at getting through the training and then every day

[2:59:24.760 --> 2:59:30.440]  my joints the extra support they need right now plus inflammation support and extra flexibility

[2:59:35.720 --> 2:59:40.840]  not crazy enough to take out a marathon good news turbo force that can still give you the energy

[3:00:44.520 --> 3:00:52.120]  and other areas are independent states before war can end he says it is a catastrophic development
[3:00:52.120 --> 3:00:58.840]  and world economic collapse could be triggered russia ukraine agree on turkey meeting russian foreign
[3:00:58.840 --> 3:01:05.000]  minister surgey labroth and his ukrainian counterpart have agreed to meet at a forum in
[3:01:05.000 --> 3:01:11.000]  southern turkey on thursday the first potential talks between the top diplomats since russia

[3:01:16.920 --> 3:01:23.720]  media on monday and of course the russians want them to have zelensky stepped down uh they've
[3:01:23.720 --> 3:01:28.920]  had the the the russian back president who was elected and overthrown by soros soros says he
[3:01:28.920 --> 3:01:35.960]  overthrew him uh in uh eight years ago and that's what the russians want and instead the west is
[3:01:35.960 --> 3:01:41.640]  pumping more weapons in and and more former u.s. troops are going in for the big fight it is just
[3:01:41.640 --> 3:01:47.720]  a mess we are not your slaves or you ask the question are we your slaves pakistan's prime
[3:01:47.720 --> 3:01:53.960]  minister rebukes pressure to condemn russia's saying when they asked u n member countries to
[3:01:53.960 --> 3:02:02.200]  rebuke india taking casimir that nothing was done against the same story with casimir it was indian
[3:02:02.200 --> 3:02:07.080]  for thousands of years and the pakistani started taking it over the last couple hundred and the
[3:02:07.080 --> 3:02:10.920]  muslim started pushing the hindus out and the hindus and buddha scott pissed it took it over
[3:02:10.920 --> 3:02:17.240]  i'm not getting between the muslims and the indians here the point is is that or the muslims
[3:02:17.240 --> 3:02:21.240]  and the hindus and the buddhist who have to be indian uh but that's that's what's going on it's
[3:02:21.240 --> 3:02:26.360]  a good point pakistan makes russia sees control of europe's largest nuclear power plant now that's
[3:02:26.360 --> 3:02:31.480]  admitted to have happened they did did not attack the plant uh they did not stage that event like
[3:02:31.480 --> 3:02:38.680]  everybody uh was uh told it was the ukrainians basically just making it up they did attack
[3:02:38.680 --> 3:02:42.680]  some of the tanks though and troops that were outside of the base and i'm not defending the
[3:02:42.680 --> 3:02:48.840]  russians in any of this i'm just reporting the truth there was no ghost of kyiv there wasn't
[3:02:48.840 --> 3:02:54.760]  a guy that blew himself up on a bridge there was no snake island uh there was no attack
[3:02:54.760 --> 3:03:01.880]  on the reactor core it was not releasing radiation and now we know that the ukrainians are very
[3:03:01.880 --> 3:03:06.680]  capable of making stuff up try to draw us into the conflict we know the secretary of state
[3:03:07.800 --> 3:03:15.240]  blinkin anthony blinkin uh came out yesterday and said i played the club he came out yesterday
[3:03:15.240 --> 3:03:21.880]  and he said to the world uh he said that oh we're sending planes via poland there and yeah
[3:03:21.880 --> 3:03:24.920]  we're going to you know have to give them jets and then poland said that's not true and that's
[3:03:24.920 --> 3:03:31.160]  an act of war uh and so we've got that situation polars stopped it will get mad no fly zone in
[3:03:31.160 --> 3:03:36.040]  ukraine likely illegal would trigger major war they went on to say we are not transferring
[3:03:36.040 --> 3:03:43.320]  fighter jets to ukraine so another lie from the western media are we surprised and that's
[3:03:43.320 --> 3:03:47.960]  what i hate about this the russians aren't perfect pootons got some problems china is
[3:03:47.960 --> 3:03:52.920]  completely evil this is giving them cover to invade taiwan i don't like what's going on but

[3:08:10.040 --> 3:08:14.280]  pipelines and we're gonna keep the borders wide open and we're gonna do all this and we're gonna
[3:08:14.280 --> 3:08:20.840]  teach you critical race theory but alex jones and roger stone are criminals who ran a plan with
[3:08:20.840 --> 3:08:25.720]  trump to attack the capital yeah and totally make ourselves look like idiots and go to jail
[3:08:25.720 --> 3:08:30.840]  and screw up the 10 day peaceful investigation we wanted i mean it's like jones and stone are so smart
[3:08:30.840 --> 3:08:35.640]  they blew their feet off with shotguns uh so roger this is a big big deal we're not just talking
[3:08:35.640 --> 3:08:41.800]  about ourselves here this is big because it's a window into where we're going so much to talk
[3:08:41.800 --> 3:08:47.720]  about here today and the so-called roger stone tapes which are gonna exclusively lay out you i
[3:08:47.720 --> 3:08:53.240]  mean i know you didn't support trump's impeachment i know uh i've seen the word video it's coming up
[3:08:53.240 --> 3:08:58.520]  next segment where you can't see your lips moving and you supposedly say these things and you're
[3:08:58.520 --> 3:09:03.080]  saying you believe this is a deep fake or some deceptive edit so roger stone thank you so much
[3:09:03.080 --> 3:09:08.520]  for joining us well alex it's unfortunate that i have to pull my roger stone still did nothing
[3:09:08.520 --> 3:09:16.600]  wrong t-shirt out of mothballs and put it back on but never underestimate the democrat fake news
[3:09:16.600 --> 3:09:24.200]  media cabal's ability to recycle the same crap over and over again and call it news and then have
[3:09:24.200 --> 3:09:31.320]  the maggots on twitter repeat it ad nauseam until it becomes a fact i lived through this before we
[3:09:31.320 --> 3:09:37.560]  all know roger stone was the conduit between wiki leaks russian intelligence and the trump
[3:09:37.560 --> 3:09:42.520]  campaign and he lied to congress about it to protect our trump except for none of that is true
[3:09:43.240 --> 3:09:49.800]  i know evidence of that ever emerged so this extraordinary assault on me by the washington
[3:09:49.800 --> 3:09:58.120]  post normally i would be complimented for entire pages of recycled goat by association
[3:09:58.120 --> 3:10:04.840]  innuendo half truce falsehoods and then the high tech piece which has to be determined
[3:10:04.840 --> 3:10:12.120]  as admirable a fake a deep fake video where you never see my mouth moving but where the soundtrack
[3:10:12.120 --> 3:10:18.360]  would lead you to believe that i am attacking the president who i was ready to go to prison for seven
[3:10:18.360 --> 3:10:26.120]  to nine years for rather than betray him through uh you know through false testimony uh it's a
[3:10:26.120 --> 3:10:34.360]  fraud it's a complete fraud um and i know how this works uh those on the left alex are extraordinarily
[3:10:34.360 --> 3:10:42.680]  but hurt by a reuters story several months ago which correctly reported that an fbi investigation
[3:10:42.680 --> 3:10:49.400]  never turned up any evidence whatsoever that either you or i were involved in any way in the
[3:10:49.400 --> 3:10:57.800]  illegal acts of january sixth it seems unfortunate that i have to say this but any claim or assertion
[3:10:57.800 --> 3:11:03.240]  or even implication to the contrary is categorically false and if anybody in the media wants to say
[3:11:03.240 --> 3:11:10.440]  it as a flat statement well i'll sue them for defamation even roger stone can be sued so what
[3:11:10.440 --> 3:11:18.440]  happens here is they write this in an effort to re interest uh investigators and calm them into
[3:11:18.440 --> 3:11:26.280]  believing they somehow missed the proof of this false assertion uh the other goal here i think
[3:11:26.920 --> 3:11:33.880]  is to take when they do this constantly perfectly legal constitutionally protected political
[3:11:33.880 --> 3:11:40.920]  activities such as protesting the results of the 2020 election and saying that you and i and many
[3:11:40.920 --> 3:11:47.480]  others practice millions of americans believe they're fraudulent that's not seditious it's not
[3:11:47.480 --> 3:11:54.040]  treasonous it's not illegal it's constitutionally protected free speech well plus roger what 80 plus
[3:11:54.040 --> 3:12:00.120]  percent now what 70 of american conservatives believe the election was stolen and over 40 of
[3:12:00.120 --> 3:12:06.600]  democrats in many national polls so i mean people really know this is going on even if we're wrong
[3:12:06.600 --> 3:12:11.480]  we have a right to challenge it polosi and others said they were going to challenge the election no
[3:12:11.480 --> 3:12:16.600]  matter what they said we're not going to accept the election of trump we're going to have delegates
[3:12:16.600 --> 3:12:21.560]  we're going to refuse it we're going to block it they said that and then when we try to have a peaceful
[3:12:21.560 --> 3:12:26.760]  10-day investigation we all need to go to jail yeah no the washington post tries to downplay
[3:12:26.760 --> 3:12:32.440]  this they say a few members of congress democratic members of congress wanted to contest the 2016
[3:12:32.440 --> 3:12:38.120]  election no john pedesta was uh hillary clinton's campaign manager was demanding that he be allowed
[3:12:38.120 --> 3:12:44.600]  to make a presentation to the electoral college to stop the certification of the of of the election
[3:12:44.600 --> 3:12:52.120]  of donald trump did anybody else addition treason uh arrest him no of course not so just another
[3:12:52.120 --> 3:12:58.840]  example of the washington post disingenuousness uh the other point here of course is perhaps it's
[3:12:58.840 --> 3:13:05.080]  because i've been in politics for so long but i foresaw the fact that after the fact the democrats
[3:13:05.080 --> 3:13:11.480]  would try to criminalize the fact that people like ted cruise and senator josh holly and matt gates
[3:13:11.480 --> 3:13:18.680]  and jim jordan and alex jones and bernie karak and roger stone exercised our first amendment right
[3:13:18.680 --> 3:13:24.600]  to question the elections but they would somehow deem that to be criminal so yes i did suggest
[3:13:24.600 --> 3:13:31.080]  that all those people and others be pardoned no i never took a dime from anyone to help them
[3:13:31.080 --> 3:13:39.160]  secure a pardon no i did not help joel greenberg the tax collector in uh in seminal county who
[3:13:39.160 --> 3:13:44.920]  is the major accuser of matt gates i did not assist him in getting a pardon never took a penny from
[3:13:44.920 --> 3:13:52.280]  anyone but what do they leave out yes i did go to bat for for big mech for demetrius floranoi
[3:13:52.280 --> 3:13:59.320]  who's an african-american uh accused and convicted for 30 years has served 15 years for financial
[3:13:59.320 --> 3:14:06.760]  crimes out in detroit all the other co-conspirators in his case uh have been released but he's in poor
[3:14:06.760 --> 3:14:11.880]  health and he continues to serve every time he comes up for parole the government falsely says
[3:14:11.880 --> 3:14:18.440]  he was convicted of a violent crime that is false so when his mother reached out to me uh and asked
[3:14:18.440 --> 3:14:27.320]  me to to read the file i did and i was moved by that so i did seek a pardon for him or clemency
[3:14:27.320 --> 3:14:34.760]  for him or just a commutation of sentence for him sadly uh i also by the way advocated a pardon
[3:14:34.760 --> 3:14:41.720]  for every single person currently incarcerated for the first time nonviolent a possession of
[3:14:41.720 --> 3:14:45.880]  a small amount of drugs for personal use and by the way roger it's our right to petition the
[3:14:45.880 --> 3:14:49.640]  government for redress of grievance they're trying to act like questioning elections is criminal
[3:14:49.640 --> 3:14:53.800]  they're trying to act like wanting pardons is criminal they want to outlaw the republican party
[3:14:53.800 --> 3:14:58.600]  and populist movement they've said we have to reprogram we have to attack we have to imprison
[3:14:58.600 --> 3:15:03.160]  trump supporters which means americans we're going to go to break and again there's several clips
[3:15:03.160 --> 3:15:08.120]  and you look at him you can't even see roger's lips moving where he's walking around saying things
[3:15:08.120 --> 3:15:13.720]  like well man trump's the worst you know possible president we could have ever uh had the worst
[3:15:13.720 --> 3:15:17.960]  election ever he should have been impeached that's not the type of stuff that roger stone says
[3:15:17.960 --> 3:15:22.440]  when you look at the videos it's weird you don't even see his mouth moving in the same sink so i
[3:15:22.440 --> 3:15:29.560]  don't know what's going on this is bizarre this is next level and then roger is going to be hosting

[3:20:33.080 --> 3:20:40.120]  post put out their four page article four large print pages unprecedented where again the article
[3:20:40.120 --> 3:20:45.000]  tells how he planned january 6 and how he's a bad guy with no proof then they have an exculpatory
[3:20:45.000 --> 3:20:50.040]  clip where he's talking about it's a bad thing that happened at the capital bad for trump bad for
[3:20:50.040 --> 3:20:56.120]  america yeah no kidding wish we got the 10 000 troops like trump asked for so out of a million
[3:20:56.120 --> 3:21:01.960]  people a few hundred went and caused the problem so in the article they have the video that's
[3:21:01.960 --> 3:21:06.680]  exculpatory but then they go look all over the news it's the proof that he was running the attack
[3:21:06.680 --> 3:21:11.320]  from the hotel here it is all right well we're gonna start pulling our stuff together
[3:21:12.760 --> 3:21:18.600]  thank god bless america all right very good we gotta check our troops let's pack right here
[3:21:18.600 --> 3:21:23.720]  all those folks come you take them as soon as possible they want to get out of town how we can
[3:21:23.720 --> 3:21:29.080]  get those here you come take this up you know i'm gonna play these off my phone because i don't
[3:21:29.080 --> 3:21:33.560]  know why this happens and it's no big deal there's so many clips we get a little confused let let me
[3:21:33.560 --> 3:21:40.760]  show everybody the clip i'm talking about um i'm gonna have to host the rest of the hour with with
[3:21:40.760 --> 3:21:46.200]  roger because we've got to get these clips out this is important the 17 second clip i want is when
[3:21:46.200 --> 3:21:52.440]  you go to the washington post article it's him walking around in the room in front of the tv
[3:21:52.440 --> 3:21:57.080]  and he says this is terrible that this happened it's bad for trump it's bad for america and if it's
[3:21:57.080 --> 3:22:03.400]  the last thing i do in my life we're gonna air that clip let's play the next clip of him in the car
[3:22:03.400 --> 3:22:07.640]  though where he's got the thing up over his face it looks chopped it looks edited to me
[3:22:07.640 --> 3:22:11.800]  and if you're going to do a deep fake you do it with a shot where the mouth is it completely clear
[3:22:11.800 --> 3:22:18.120]  here it is i'm going to go public supporting impeachment i have no choice he has to go he has
[3:22:18.120 --> 3:22:25.560]  to go run again you'll get your fucking brains beaten all right so roger you know the point is
[3:22:25.560 --> 3:22:30.200]  is that i've seen a lot of attacks on me it's a lot of flat out news saying i said things i never said
[3:22:30.200 --> 3:22:35.000]  uh but you've been one of the biggest supporters of the president out there you know i've heard you
[3:22:35.000 --> 3:22:40.360]  frustrated before that he wouldn't fire people earlier like mcmasters and stuff but you've never
[3:22:40.360 --> 3:22:45.320]  never said you want him impeached you fought against both illegal impeachments uh fraudulent
[3:22:45.320 --> 3:22:49.960]  impeachments against the president and i've said repeatedly that he's the only candidate who can
[3:22:49.960 --> 3:22:56.520]  win again in 2024 and i pledge my support to him this is what is known alex as a deep fake here's
[3:22:56.520 --> 3:23:03.400]  the background these danish filmmakers approached me with financing from the danish government
[3:23:04.280 --> 3:23:12.040]  seeking uh to do a documentary on my trial little did i know that they were spying on me
[3:23:12.040 --> 3:23:18.600]  that they were taking uh photo screenshots of my phone screenshots of my computer screenshots
[3:23:18.600 --> 3:23:25.160]  of the computers of folks who worked for me uh their goal is very simple i think the idea of my
[3:23:25.160 --> 3:23:31.400]  teaming up with trump again in 2024 after they kept me off the battlefield in 2020 scares the
[3:23:31.400 --> 3:23:38.280]  bejesus out of the left and the democrats that is what is known as a deep fake i never said those
[3:23:38.280 --> 3:23:44.760]  things why would i i love donald trump i try to get him to run since 1988 i was prepared to do
[3:23:44.760 --> 3:23:51.880]  seven to nine years in prison rather than bear false witness against him so the allegation against
[3:23:51.880 --> 3:23:59.400]  me is entirely uh illogical uh it is meant to drive a wedge between the president and me uh
[3:23:59.400 --> 3:24:04.520]  this is uh of course going to be met with legal action this documentary for which i have never
[3:24:04.520 --> 3:24:11.320]  signed a release will never be seen in the united states that's why these butt hurt danish socialists
[3:24:11.320 --> 3:24:16.600]  went running to the washington post who now wrapped this up one more time in an effort
[3:24:16.600 --> 3:24:23.720]  a to take perfectly legal political activities and try to portray them in a sinister way to try
[3:24:23.720 --> 3:24:29.640]  to get investigators into them and secondly to try to drive a wedge between me and the president i
[3:24:29.640 --> 3:24:35.960]  love it's a fraud anybody who will look at it can see that is a fraud uh the other clip that you
[3:24:35.960 --> 3:24:43.880]  refer to is absolutely true we went to washington to try to get a 10 day delay in the certification
[3:24:43.880 --> 3:24:50.680]  of the election of joe biden so that the anomalies and the irregularities in arizona
[3:24:50.680 --> 3:24:57.640]  michigan wisconsin nevada and pennsylvania and other states could be more carefully examined
[3:24:57.640 --> 3:25:04.840]  those poor souls those misguided souls who stormed the capital destroyed what was a perfectly
[3:25:04.840 --> 3:25:10.120]  legal political strategy and by the way we did find the clip there's 25 minutes of these and so
[3:25:10.120 --> 3:25:14.440]  it's it's not the cruise fault i forgot before you came on to give them the clips i wanted so i've
[3:25:14.440 --> 3:25:19.000]  been frantically running around since you were on getting these clips here's one of the clips that
[3:25:19.000 --> 3:25:24.600]  they put out but then say that you were secretly behind the attack with steve bannon who you hate
[3:25:24.600 --> 3:25:29.560]  so again none of this matches up with reality but they don't care here's the clip all right we're
[3:25:29.560 --> 3:25:47.800]  gonna start pulling our stuff together all right very good uh no i think it's really bad for the
[3:25:47.800 --> 3:25:53.880]  movement it's really this hurts it doesn't help i i don't i'm not sure what they thought they were
[3:25:53.880 --> 3:26:01.320]  going to achieve boy i just wanted to get your so there's the evil mastermind uh right there roger
[3:26:01.320 --> 3:26:06.120]  and i remember i talked to you and i said on record he was pissed off that you got your
[3:26:06.120 --> 3:26:10.440]  speaking slot taken away when they asked you to come same with me we didn't care about that
[3:26:10.440 --> 3:26:15.000]  and we came to try to fight election fraud and now they want to put us in jail and roger isn't
[3:26:15.000 --> 3:26:19.400]  that what this means here with the roger stone tapes all over the news one of the there's a
[3:26:19.400 --> 3:26:25.560]  major war going on and cnn's running promo pieces against me saying i'm the devil there's full page
[3:26:25.560 --> 3:26:30.200]  four page things against you why are they so obsessed with us because to understand the
[3:26:30.200 --> 3:26:35.000]  enemy's mind we need to understand this well they hate me because i've beaten them in so many
[3:26:35.000 --> 3:26:40.280]  elections and if i'm involved in 2024 we will beat them again take back the country they hate you
[3:26:40.280 --> 3:26:47.000]  because info wars is a beacon of truth uh in a sea of lies uh they would like nothing better than to
[3:26:47.000 --> 3:26:53.320]  shut info wars down look i'm not ready to give up fighting i'll never give up fighting and this
[3:26:53.320 --> 3:27:00.840]  latest assault uh it proves my whole point which is i was shocked by what happened at the capital
[3:27:00.840 --> 3:27:06.600]  i do don't think that excuses the abuse of the current january six detainees i don't think
[3:27:06.600 --> 3:27:13.800]  that you should be in security uh uh uh in uh solitary confinement 23 hours a day for trespassing
[3:27:13.800 --> 3:27:19.000]  i don't think your food should be cold and laced with feces i don't think you should be subjected
[3:27:19.000 --> 3:27:23.720]  to random beatings just because they feel like it i don't think you should be denied medical
[3:27:23.720 --> 3:27:29.640]  attention if you need it i don't think you should be allowed due process uh in your attempts to
[3:27:29.640 --> 3:27:35.320]  defend yourself those who've chosen to defend themselves are given access to a law library or
[3:27:35.320 --> 3:27:39.400]  a or a uh well that's right if you don't plead guilty you're kept in solitary confinement now
[3:27:39.400 --> 3:27:45.240]  for over a year a man was arrested uh in texas last year he's been held over 80 days with no
[3:27:45.240 --> 3:27:50.760]  indictment no judge no nothing so literally throwing people in dungeons like north korea that is a
[3:27:50.760 --> 3:27:56.360]  felony every day they do that past two weeks this is the criminal federal government right here
[3:27:57.720 --> 3:28:04.280]  that says it all in that poor sob who killed himself last week i my heart goes out to him
[3:28:04.280 --> 3:28:10.360]  and his family this is horrific but he was drove driven to take his own life because the actions of
[3:28:10.360 --> 3:28:17.080]  the u.s. government this is a violation of the janeva conventions we treat terrorists and illegals
[3:28:17.080 --> 3:28:22.680]  better than we are treating our own census our own citizens and where is mitch mcconnell hey
[3:28:22.680 --> 3:28:26.920]  roger we gotta go to break you're gonna come back and host the next two segments incredible job

[3:28:40.600 --> 3:28:46.280]  election by republicans is not going to solve the repop the problem if we don't replace the
[3:28:46.280 --> 3:28:50.520]  leadership i'm gonna lay out a plan to save this country it's coming right up all right
[3:28:50.520 --> 3:28:58.600]  thank you great job crew will be right back has been noted by many a historian the first
[3:28:58.600 --> 3:29:05.640]  casualty of war is the truth then the next big casualty isn't even the people that died
[3:29:06.360 --> 3:29:13.800]  no that is very very follows but first there is the crackdown on populations basic liberty
[3:29:13.800 --> 3:29:19.480]  and speech and massive censorship and now across the world from the united states to europe
[3:29:19.480 --> 3:29:28.520]  the legislation is being introduced that if you amplify any quote pro russian information
[3:29:29.080 --> 3:29:35.000]  you can be censored you can be arrested you can be imprisoned and of course now canada is
[3:29:35.000 --> 3:29:41.400]  under this legislation that if you have a thought crime and they think you may have the intent to
[3:29:41.400 --> 3:29:47.480]  engage in hate speech online that you will be censored and arrested ladies and gentlemen the
[3:29:47.480 --> 3:29:52.360]  authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around the world against humanity
[3:29:52.360 --> 3:29:58.440]  that makes them followers dot com more important than ever sleepless nights seem to be a lot more
[3:29:58.440 --> 3:30:04.440]  common these days with everything that's going on both at home and the world at large if you're
[3:30:04.440 --> 3:30:09.320]  having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of our new sleep support
[3:30:09.320 --> 3:30:15.720]  formula down and out it's just the thing it's our new faster absorbing liquid formula that is
[3:30:15.720 --> 3:30:21.560]  specifically designed to help you get the shutout you deserve formulated to improve upon our best
[3:30:21.560 --> 3:30:27.640]  selling product knockout with down and out now the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted
[3:30:27.640 --> 3:30:33.160]  directly into the glycerin solution so the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula
[3:30:33.160 --> 3:30:39.080]  before you even take it one of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower which
[3:30:39.080 --> 3:30:45.480]  was traditionally used by native americans like the cherries who used it for its relaxing qualities
[3:30:45.480 --> 3:30:50.280]  be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will be
[3:30:50.280 --> 3:30:58.280]  down and out selling out now at info or store dot com the globalist social engineers always
[3:30:58.280 --> 3:31:05.480]  intended to push their coveted biomedical tyranny lockdowns until the populations
[3:31:05.480 --> 3:31:12.040]  rebelled they would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting
[3:31:12.040 --> 3:31:17.720]  anybody that speaks out against their lives but because of so many sciences and engineers and
[3:31:17.720 --> 3:31:23.720]  researchers and others coming public and and whistleblowers now their whole project is falling
[3:31:23.720 --> 3:31:30.840]  apart because the people are aware that it is a world government corporate takeover and so it's
[3:31:30.840 --> 3:31:35.880]  pulling back the curtain now more than ever the problem is some globalist controlled areas are
[3:31:35.880 --> 3:31:41.960]  not going to give up on their takeover like canada but they've now declared a civil emergency and
[3:31:41.960 --> 3:31:47.480]  martial law in ontario and other areas of the world are following suit like australia so pray
[3:31:47.480 --> 3:31:52.920]  for these folks big time this is a very serious situation and stay tuned into info wars dot com
[3:31:52.920 --> 3:32:01.320]  because truth is absolutely paramount it's hard to believe that we're already into march 2022
[3:32:01.320 --> 3:32:07.960]  and in the month of february we had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product x3
[3:32:07.960 --> 3:32:14.920]  that has all three types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical cellular
[3:32:14.920 --> 3:32:21.000]  activity in your body your immune system your stamina your libido so much and the majority of
[3:32:21.000 --> 3:32:26.680]  the population of the world is iodine deficient this is the very best iodine out there so we have
[3:32:26.680 --> 3:32:32.040]  on sale 50 off but we sold more than half of what we have or is it going to come in for a long time
[3:32:32.040 --> 3:32:36.920]  so i took it back to full process i was just thinking you know what we need to funds in now
[3:32:36.920 --> 3:32:42.200]  to stay on air plus this is the right product everybody needs so to incentivize folks out
[3:32:42.200 --> 3:32:46.600]  there that have been on the fence get x3 and experience it yourself and support the broadcast
[3:32:46.600 --> 3:32:53.080]  i'm going to keep it at 50 off until it sells out get x3 right now exclusively at infowarstore.com
[3:32:53.080 --> 3:33:03.800]  for 50 off leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:33:13.560 --> 3:33:19.560]  this is roger stone and this is the alex jones show feels great to be back in the saddle if you
[3:33:19.560 --> 3:33:24.440]  want to know the truth and i'm grateful to alex jones for giving me the opportunity to clear the
[3:33:24.440 --> 3:33:31.800]  air because needless to say after this attack by the washington post using a deep fake video
[3:33:31.800 --> 3:33:38.760]  which incorrectly shows me criticizing the president i love rolling stone the business insider
[3:33:38.760 --> 3:33:46.200]  all of the same phony non-news outlets people who pose as journalists but who really are
[3:33:46.200 --> 3:33:52.120]  distortionists and propagandists jump on the story what is their goal well they kept me off the
[3:33:52.120 --> 3:33:58.120]  battlefield in 2020 i think it's one of the reasons i must say that the president lost
[3:33:58.120 --> 3:34:03.960]  and they'd like to keep me from helping him again in 2024 so they'd like to drive a wedge between
[3:34:03.960 --> 3:34:08.520]  the president and i now it's certainly true that i've been critical of some of the president's
[3:34:08.520 --> 3:34:14.280]  decisions i think he should have pardoned julien assange i think he should have pardoned
[3:34:14.280 --> 3:34:21.240]  edward snowden the only crimes of those men was exposing the corruption of the deep state
[3:34:21.240 --> 3:34:26.920]  i would not have appointed mike pompeo who despite the president's affection for him
[3:34:26.920 --> 3:34:31.720]  is the man who laid the underpinnings for the russian collusion hoax when he said
[3:34:31.720 --> 3:34:38.840]  julien assange was a foreign state actor no mr secretary he's not but you're responsible
[3:34:38.840 --> 3:34:45.160]  for the russian collusion hoax in any event what i want to focus on in the last time we have left
[3:34:45.160 --> 3:34:51.160]  is the epic struggle for america because unfortunately many americans believe that if
[3:34:51.160 --> 3:34:56.920]  the republicans are successful in winning control of the us house and the us senate
[3:34:56.920 --> 3:35:02.760]  that things will change unfortunately i don't believe that you see i don't think our problem
[3:35:02.760 --> 3:35:11.800]  today uh is are the wacky screwball radical socialists who would literally cancel the us
[3:35:11.800 --> 3:35:22.280]  constitution no i think the problem today are gutless feckless weak need uh self uh interested
[3:35:23.240 --> 3:35:31.720]  lily livered white wine swelling country club belonging establishment republicans people who
[3:35:31.720 --> 3:35:39.320]  are really only in politics to line their pockets and the pockets of their friends you see trumps
[3:35:39.320 --> 3:35:46.600]  nomination in 2016 was essentially the hostile takeover of the republican party taking it away
[3:35:46.600 --> 3:35:54.840]  from the country club republicans uh epitomized by the epically corrupt bush family uh and now
[3:35:54.840 --> 3:36:00.840]  the real fight is within the republican party the real fight uh is going to be not in the
[3:36:00.840 --> 3:36:07.960]  general election but in the primaries you see the the the stage is set for a great republican
[3:36:07.960 --> 3:36:15.000]  revival the stage is set to retake the house and the senate but it depends on what kind of men and
[3:36:15.000 --> 3:36:21.240]  women we elect in the primaries i should say select in the primaries for the general election
[3:36:21.960 --> 3:36:28.840]  i was approached some time ago by a man named jackson law mire a pastor from oklahoma told
[3:36:28.840 --> 3:36:33.400]  me he was running for the senate and he was running against james langford uh who's been
[3:36:33.400 --> 3:36:38.600]  out in washington for 10 years my general impression of langford was that he was a
[3:36:38.600 --> 3:36:43.960]  solid conservative i actually thought he was a good guy but that means i hadn't studied his
[3:36:43.960 --> 3:36:49.960]  record very carefully here's what i found out on the morning of january 6 james langford was
[3:36:49.960 --> 3:36:57.160]  prepared to object to the certification of the election of joe biden on the basis of fraud but
[3:36:57.160 --> 3:37:02.520]  by the afternoon it was james langford who moved for the certification of joe biden's election
[3:37:03.160 --> 3:37:09.800]  then senator langford apologized to black lives matter and the black community in tulsa saying
[3:37:09.800 --> 3:37:16.440]  that his initial questions about the election outcome were racist this by the way is the same
[3:37:16.440 --> 3:37:23.000]  james langford who said at the time that he was open to a third impeachment of donald trump
[3:37:23.000 --> 3:37:29.560]  now i then took a closer look and realized that as a member of the senate intelligence committee
[3:37:29.560 --> 3:37:37.000]  for four years james langford never once stood up in the defense of donald trump and called out
[3:37:37.000 --> 3:37:43.480]  the russian collusion hoax as a member of the committee he surely knew that the steele dossier
[3:37:43.480 --> 3:37:50.840]  was a fraud he surely knew that the so-called crowd strikes report had no proof whatsoever
[3:37:50.840 --> 3:37:57.800]  that the russians had hacked the dnc and given the information to wiki leaks which then published it
[3:37:57.800 --> 3:38:05.080]  those are two of the central pillars of the russian collusion hoax but where was james langford
[3:38:05.080 --> 3:38:11.320]  oh i'll tell you where he was he was busy trying to take andrew jackson off the 20 bill he was
[3:38:11.320 --> 3:38:17.240]  busy trying to cancel columbus day as a federal holiday which i as an italian-american find
[3:38:17.240 --> 3:38:24.440]  extraordinarily offensive but he wants to replace it with juneteenth yes this is the same james
[3:38:24.440 --> 3:38:31.480]  langford the junior senator from oklahoma who actually supports open borders who worked with
[3:38:31.480 --> 3:38:38.280]  marco rubio and lindsey graham and others to open and give amnesty to those who came here illegally
[3:38:38.280 --> 3:38:45.000]  and then give them citizenship so if you have the impression that james langford is some kind of
[3:38:45.000 --> 3:38:52.360]  reliable conservative you're wrong he's a man who said donald trump was a poor role model for our
[3:38:52.360 --> 3:38:57.960]  children no i think donald trump is the greatest president since abraham lincoln and the reason
[3:38:57.960 --> 3:39:05.000]  they have attacked me so viciously particularly in this new round of attacks is because they fear
[3:39:05.000 --> 3:39:12.040]  what we could do in 2024 together see i'm not going to give up despite the fact that i came this
[3:39:12.040 --> 3:39:19.480]  close to a death sentence in a completely fabricated trial i have no intention of packing it in it's
[3:39:19.480 --> 3:39:24.680]  so funny the washington post spent four whole pages attacking me on sunday but they've never
[3:39:24.680 --> 3:39:31.880]  reported the fact that moller's entire report that was only released at court order actually
[3:39:31.880 --> 3:39:38.840]  included the admission by moller that he'd found no evidence whatsoever of my involvement in russian
[3:39:38.840 --> 3:39:47.400]  collusion wiki leaks collaboration or the theft and publication of john pedestrian emails the reason
[3:39:47.400 --> 3:39:53.000]  that this comes to no public note in the washington post is because it proves that there was nothing
[3:39:53.000 --> 3:39:59.080]  for me to lie about to congress the judge in my case specifically said you lied to cover up for
[3:39:59.080 --> 3:40:05.160]  donald trump what was i covering up for there was nothing to cover up for she said you lied about a
[3:40:05.160 --> 3:40:11.080]  matter of international importance but moller admits in his report that he had quote no factual
[3:40:11.080 --> 3:40:17.960]  evidence that i had lied about anything pertaining to russian collusion or improper foreign interference
[3:40:17.960 --> 3:40:24.040]  in the election that didn't stop the prosecutors in my case when we came to the sentencing portion
[3:40:24.040 --> 3:40:29.880]  to say specifically that i had been involved in foreign interference in our election that's why
[3:40:29.880 --> 3:40:36.200]  they were trying to give me seven to nine years essentially giving me extra prison time for crimes
[3:40:36.200 --> 3:40:42.680]  that i had never even been charged with or convicted of i i think that it's time to have a house
[3:40:42.680 --> 3:40:48.360]  cleaning in the republican party now what's going on in oklahoma to set the table is particularly
[3:40:48.360 --> 3:40:55.080]  interesting not only is there a primary for the seat of senator james langford there is also a
[3:40:55.080 --> 3:41:02.920]  primary and an election for the senator the senate seat of senator james inhoff james inhoff the senior
[3:41:02.920 --> 3:41:11.080]  senator from oklahoma made his resignation clear weeks ago and his resignation will be effective
[3:41:11.080 --> 3:41:18.440]  upon the selection of a successor that means both senate seats in oklahoma will be on the ballot
[3:41:18.440 --> 3:41:26.920]  june 28th and in oklahoma if no candidate has 50 percent well then the top two vote getters
[3:41:26.920 --> 3:41:35.720]  go to a runoff the good news is jackson lawmire political outsider pastor businessman and america
[3:41:35.720 --> 3:41:43.640]  first republican now has a clear shot at james langford as the third candidate in that race senator
[3:41:43.640 --> 3:41:51.240]  nathan dom a solid conservative endorsed by senator rand paul has switched to the inhoff race
[3:41:51.240 --> 3:41:57.640]  this sets the stage for one of the greatest political upsets in american history so on the
[3:41:57.640 --> 3:42:04.200]  other side we're going to have an interview with jackson lawmire the man i believe is on the cusp
[3:42:04.200 --> 3:42:10.440]  of pulling off one of the greatest political upsets in american history in the meantime let me remind
[3:42:10.440 --> 3:42:16.840]  you that we need your support here at info wars so if you haven't gone to the info wars store today
[3:42:16.840 --> 3:42:23.160]  well now would be a great time to do so you see info wars is a beacon of freedom and i would have
[3:42:23.160 --> 3:42:30.280]  no place to go today to tell you that the washington post has used insinuations path truths lies and
[3:42:30.280 --> 3:42:36.200]  a deep fake video in an attempt to destroy me today we're there no info wars today there's no
[3:42:36.200 --> 3:42:41.160]  place else i can tell you the truth folks on the other side one of the most dynamic young
[3:42:41.160 --> 3:42:46.840]  conservatives in america a man i think who's going to pull off the greatest upset in american
[3:42:46.840 --> 3:42:53.640]  political history it is going to begin the downfall of the rhinos jackson lawmire will be right back
[3:42:56.200 --> 3:43:03.880]  it's hard to believe we're already into march 2022 and in the month of february we had a very popular
[3:43:03.880 --> 3:43:11.080]  sale that was going of our flagship product x3 that has all three types of the amazing iodine
[3:43:11.080 --> 3:43:17.800]  your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity in your body your immune system your
[3:43:17.800 --> 3:43:24.040]  stamina your libido so much and the majority of the population of the world is iodine deficient
[3:43:24.040 --> 3:43:29.320]  this is the very best iodine out there so we had on cell 50% off but we sold more than half of what

[3:47:26.760 --> 3:47:33.560]  america now i want to introduce to you one of the leading america first candidates in the country
[3:47:33.560 --> 3:47:39.880]  a man who i believe has an exceptional shot at the u.s senate who would uh who's endorsed by
[3:47:39.880 --> 3:47:47.080]  general michael flinn i've endorsed him myself in full disclosure but joining us from tulsa oklahoma
[3:47:47.080 --> 3:47:54.440]  is jackson law mire jackson welcome to the alex jones show hey hey mr stone thank you so much
[3:47:54.440 --> 3:47:59.880]  for having me on and we love the alex jones show it's a real honor to be on today great i'm glad
[3:47:59.880 --> 3:48:05.480]  to have you with us why don't you tell us the circumstances under which you decided to take
[3:48:05.480 --> 3:48:12.120]  this uphill race for the u.s senate on yeah you know i've never been into politics in the sense
[3:48:12.120 --> 3:48:18.120]  of never ran for office i passed her a church in tulsa i own a business in a waso but last year i
[3:48:18.120 --> 3:48:23.480]  was so frustrated with what was happening in our country especially on january the 6th when i saw
[3:48:23.480 --> 3:48:28.840]  james langford cave like an absolute coward on national television i was griping to my wife
[3:48:28.840 --> 3:48:33.400]  about the state of the country and she kept pushing you know she said you need to run you need to run
[3:48:33.400 --> 3:48:38.200]  against langford and i wasn't a big fan of it because i didn't really know what it would look
[3:48:38.200 --> 3:48:42.840]  like to run a statewide race but then all of a sudden everything changed when i was doing an
[3:48:42.840 --> 3:48:48.280]  interview kind of like this with anvander still uh general michael flinn saw that interview
[3:48:48.280 --> 3:48:53.400]  and he liked what he saw and he gave me a call and he said you're going to run and you're going
[3:48:53.400 --> 3:48:59.480]  to win and i said uh yes sir and so that got me into the race and we have just been doing
[3:48:59.480 --> 3:49:04.920]  exceedingly well ever since i mean you've seen some of our rallies we have huge rallies
[3:49:04.920 --> 3:49:08.600]  all throughout the state of oklahoma people just show up in droves we've had
[3:49:08.600 --> 3:49:15.560]  nearly 7 000 individuals donate to the campaign and the reason this movement is having such success
[3:49:15.560 --> 3:49:21.000]  is because it's a movement that's going to put america first that's the biggest problem we have
[3:49:21.000 --> 3:49:27.160]  is like you mentioned it's not the crazy democrats who are honest with us it's the weak corrupt
[3:49:27.160 --> 3:49:33.400]  spineless republicans who never put america first and i believe that if we will sweep the
[3:49:33.400 --> 3:49:39.560]  board in 2022 with america first patriots in the house and the senate we can change some things
[3:49:39.560 --> 3:49:43.400]  but if we just select same old same old republicans nothing's going to change
[3:49:45.000 --> 3:49:51.880]  so let's say that you were in the united states senate give us some idea of the agenda that you
[3:49:51.880 --> 3:49:56.440]  would pursue what do you think the most important issues are in the country and what would you do
[3:49:56.440 --> 3:50:03.880]  about them yeah so i have three short term goals that immediately upon being sworn in
[3:50:03.880 --> 3:50:10.600]  day one i'll be releasing legislation this will be bill one to cut off all federal funding
[3:50:10.600 --> 3:50:15.800]  to any school district in america that teaches critical race theory we cannot have this in
[3:50:15.800 --> 3:50:21.320]  our country this is the united states of america we do not want to teach racism and indoctrinate
[3:50:21.320 --> 3:50:28.120]  kids with racism we cannot have crt being taught that's day one bill one day one bill two i will
[3:50:28.120 --> 3:50:35.480]  also be releasing legislation that will ban chinese nationalists from being able to purchase
[3:50:35.480 --> 3:50:41.960]  american farmland mr. stone this is a major problem in the state of oklahoma alone not the
[3:50:41.960 --> 3:50:49.960]  united states just the state of oklahoma over 300 000 acres of oklahoma farmland has been purchased
[3:50:49.960 --> 3:50:59.240]  not by asian americans but by red communist chinese nationalists american farmland belongs to americans
[3:50:59.240 --> 3:51:06.280]  we cannot have that so that's day one bill two and then on day one i will join forces with rand paul
[3:51:06.280 --> 3:51:13.800]  in the senate to bring about justice to anthony fouchi anthony fouchi is a mass murderer and
[3:51:13.800 --> 3:51:21.400]  anthony fouchi needs to be fired arrested and convicted of crimes against humanity and it's
[3:51:21.400 --> 3:51:28.200]  very sad that senator rand paul is nearly the only one on the republican side in the senate
[3:51:28.200 --> 3:51:33.960]  that is going after anthony fouchi and so i have pledged to go after him and then obviously you know
[3:51:33.960 --> 3:51:39.960]  i've been open and honest about this in the united states senate i will support a bag of chips
[3:51:39.960 --> 3:51:44.360]  before i support mitch mcconnell to be the leader of the republicans in the senate we've
[3:51:44.360 --> 3:51:50.760]  got to have an america first leader and mitch mcconnell is not america first i think that's
[3:51:50.760 --> 3:51:57.880]  exactly right now you first came to my attention when i read about your efforts to keep your church
[3:51:57.880 --> 3:52:04.680]  open uh in the face of a of a massive mask mandate and shut down ordered by the city of
[3:52:04.680 --> 3:52:11.560]  tulsa tell us about that well you know as early on in march when things nobody knew what was going
[3:52:11.560 --> 3:52:17.000]  on we had the models that said 2.2 million americans were going to die and the pcr test that had
[3:52:17.000 --> 3:52:22.920]  highly inflated the rate of what people actually had covid and everyone was panicking so we decided
[3:52:22.920 --> 3:52:28.040]  to make an adjustment we were going to do drive-in church services i would preach from the roof of
[3:52:28.040 --> 3:52:33.720]  the church and we do drive-in church services well the mayor of tulsa he was not a big fan of that
[3:52:33.720 --> 3:52:40.040]  so he signed an executive order on friday before our first drive-in church service banning all
[3:52:40.040 --> 3:52:44.840]  public gatherings of more than five people and so the tulsa police called me they said hey you can't
[3:52:44.840 --> 3:52:49.640]  do drive-in church on sunday the mayor is not happy if you do it you could be arrested and i
[3:52:49.640 --> 3:52:54.520]  gathered my church staff and i just said hey uh we weren't doing this to be rebels we were doing
[3:52:54.520 --> 3:52:59.240]  this to make an adjustment for our church but if they want to arrest me they'll have to come to the
[3:52:59.240 --> 3:53:05.000]  roof of this church in order to do it so we had drive-in church nothing happened the mask mandate
[3:53:05.000 --> 3:53:10.120]  came they tried to force that upon us we had a policy at the church called common sense if you
[3:53:10.120 --> 3:53:14.120]  want to wear the mask you could have you didn't you didn't have to i threatened to sue the city
[3:53:14.760 --> 3:53:20.280]  and uh they backed off very quickly so we fought as a church we fought and then since then
[3:53:20.280 --> 3:53:27.400]  yet the vaccine mandates that have come through i have personally signed over 55 000 covid 19
[3:53:27.400 --> 3:53:32.520]  religious exemption forms for people all across the country and if somebody is watching right now
[3:53:33.160 --> 3:53:38.120]  and they're in a situation where their employer is requiring them to be vaccinated and for whatever
[3:53:38.120 --> 3:53:44.520]  reason they do not want to be they can go to my website jacksonlawmire.com and they can download
[3:53:44.520 --> 3:53:49.720]  the free covid 19 religious exemption form itself thousands of people across the country
[3:53:49.720 --> 3:53:57.640]  now because i'm a political junkie and i follow this i saw that one of the congressman
[3:53:57.640 --> 3:54:03.080]  mark wane mullen announced that he was going to be seeking the us senate seat that seems to me
[3:54:03.080 --> 3:54:10.280]  that it opens up the second district seat in eastern oklahoma and then i was very pleased
[3:54:10.280 --> 3:54:16.040]  to learn that the current republican state chairman john bennett who's endorsed your campaign
[3:54:16.040 --> 3:54:22.760]  most courageously for the us senate has announced his candidacy for the house tell us a little
[3:54:22.760 --> 3:54:29.560]  bit about john bennett if you can well you know john bennett is a total warrior he did something
[3:54:29.560 --> 3:54:35.000]  that has never happened in the state of oklahoma before john bennett was elected the chairman of
[3:54:35.000 --> 3:54:41.400]  the oklahoma republican party back in april of last year and john promised that he was going to
[3:54:41.400 --> 3:54:47.240]  cleanse the house of the biggest problem in the republican party which is rhinos and so john began
[3:54:47.240 --> 3:54:54.600]  fighting and john did something like i said it's never been done before he endorsed me in the primary
[3:54:54.600 --> 3:54:59.800]  it's never happened before that a party chairman in the state of oklahoma for the republican party
[3:54:59.800 --> 3:55:06.680]  endorses a candidate in a primary but john had the courage he had the integrity to do the right
[3:55:06.680 --> 3:55:11.720]  thing now he took tremendous hell for doing it i mean they putting through hell for doing that
[3:55:11.720 --> 3:55:17.960]  but he withstood it he came out stronger because of it and now he's running for the united state
[3:55:17.960 --> 3:55:23.080]  congress and i can tell you mr stone you know this probably better than anybody they do not want a
[3:55:23.080 --> 3:55:28.920]  lawn mire and bennett in washington dc one in the senate one in the house i'm telling you they don't
[3:55:28.920 --> 3:55:34.440]  want it all the reason more we got to get there well the thing that's impressed me most about
[3:55:34.440 --> 3:55:39.800]  john bennett was he was the first state legislature i think among a handful of state legislatures
[3:55:39.800 --> 3:55:46.360]  to endorse john trump for president as early as 2015 or uh this is a an enormous act of courage
[3:55:46.360 --> 3:55:52.360]  where the republican establishment was voting for bush republican ted cruise who by the way
[3:55:52.360 --> 3:55:59.240]  endorsed backstabbing rhino the most i would say anti-trump republican in the caucus james
[3:55:59.240 --> 3:56:06.120]  langford several days ago i must say i've seen firsthand the grassroots campaign that you are
[3:56:06.120 --> 3:56:12.360]  building i've never seen thousands of people show up for rallies i've never seen a campaign
[3:56:12.360 --> 3:56:20.200]  where six thousand people have contributed to your campaign 95 percent of them from the state
[3:56:20.200 --> 3:56:26.280]  of oklahoma so in the in the very little time we have left tell people how they can support
[3:56:26.280 --> 3:56:33.880]  your campaign where can they go yeah so then go to my website jacksonlawmire.com now mr stone you
