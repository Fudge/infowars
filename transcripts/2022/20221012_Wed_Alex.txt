[00:00.000 --> 00:20.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:31.000 --> 00:41.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:41.000 --> 00:49.000]  It's Wednesday, October 12, 2022, and our planet has never been in more danger of total annihilation.
[00:49.000 --> 00:56.000]  The forces of Satan are attempting to drive humanity into thermonuclear biological chemical war.
[00:56.000 --> 01:00.000]  400-plus nuclear reactors to melt down.
[01:00.000 --> 01:03.000]  I would estimate 5 billion dead in the first year.
[01:03.000 --> 01:06.000]  Maybe 100 million survive.
[01:06.000 --> 01:09.000]  That's the best case scenario.
[01:09.000 --> 01:17.000]  But the globalists actually say they want to reduce the world population down to just 500 million.
[01:17.000 --> 01:20.000]  And that's their external statements.
[01:20.000 --> 01:23.000]  Internal information tells us they believe in a post-human world,
[01:23.000 --> 01:27.000]  and they have made a deal with interdimensional off-world influence.
[01:27.000 --> 01:35.000]  We know as Satan to actually kill all humans on Earth for the opportunity to merge with this species.
[01:35.000 --> 01:41.000]  That's who they are. This is very serious. Elon Musk talks about it. This is not a joke.
[01:41.000 --> 01:45.000]  You notice the media doesn't even make jokes about me saying this because it's a cult.
[01:45.000 --> 01:49.000]  It's a satanic, anti-human, off-world cult.
[01:49.000 --> 01:53.000]  The aliens don't attack in flying saucers like Mars attacks.
[01:53.000 --> 01:57.000]  They're here. It's interdimensional. Every ancient religion told you.
[01:57.000 --> 02:00.000]  The Bible spells it out extremely clearly.
[02:00.000 --> 02:06.000]  We are dealing with a fallen off-world species that is parasitic and is seeking to use us
[02:06.000 --> 02:10.000]  because we're actually more advanced, we just don't know it, or an embryonic phase
[02:10.000 --> 02:14.000]  to build them their escape plan model.
[02:14.000 --> 02:18.000]  They intend to merge with humans and then jump off-world.
[02:18.000 --> 02:21.000]  We are their escape pod.
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.000]  Now, that's the big secret. That's what they don't want you to know.
[02:24.000 --> 02:26.000]  That's why all this is happening.
[02:26.000 --> 02:29.000]  And once you understand that, it all makes sense once you open the Bible up
[02:29.000 --> 02:34.000]  and read the Old Testament, read the New Testament, read the Last Book Revelation,
[02:34.000 --> 02:37.000]  read Daniel, read it all for yourself.
[02:37.000 --> 02:41.000]  And if you read it like you're going to the store to buy a science fiction book, it makes perfect sense.
[02:41.000 --> 02:47.000]  If you read it the way these idiot-controlled preachers read it,
[02:47.000 --> 02:50.000]  it won't make any sense. They're doing that by design.
[02:50.000 --> 02:55.000]  The ancient Christians knew all of this. The Jews know all of this.
[02:55.000 --> 03:01.000]  It's the big secret. The angels, the Ark of the Covenant, Ezekiel's fiery wheel.
[03:01.000 --> 03:04.000]  The Egyptians knew it.
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.000]  The ancient Babylonians knew it. The Sumerians knew it.
[03:08.000 --> 03:13.000]  It's a fact. They've decoded the Sumerian text.
[03:13.000 --> 03:17.000]  And it's basically what you get in Genesis, but more detailed.
[03:17.000 --> 03:26.000]  And they make movies about it, like Prometheus telling you exactly what they believe our real history is.
[03:26.000 --> 03:36.000]  So, if you ask yourself, why are they injecting us with something that grows nanotech structures in our body,
[03:36.000 --> 03:43.000]  graphene oxide? Why would they be trying to destroy the family? Why would they be poisoning us? Why would they be mutating us?
[03:43.000 --> 03:48.000]  Because they have a program to take us over.
[03:48.000 --> 04:00.000]  And in the process, use us as their advanced technology engine to then, again, escape their maroon status on this planet.
[04:00.000 --> 04:03.000]  Very simple.
[04:03.000 --> 04:07.000]  And again, you're like, well, if they're so advanced, why do they need us?
[04:07.000 --> 04:15.000]  Whatever humans imagine we can then build, that's what Genesis tells us we're made in the image of God, made by God in his image.
[04:15.000 --> 04:24.000]  We're not God, but we're made with free will that God has, that God has given us to do anything we want, basically.
[04:24.000 --> 04:30.000]  These creatures are just longer along in their development, but not anywhere as advanced as we are.
[04:30.000 --> 04:38.000]  And very robotic. They see us as basically food. They're falling.
[04:38.000 --> 04:42.000]  And they can't get up without us.
[04:42.000 --> 04:49.000]  And that's why they're giving us these horrible ideas and horrible programs that they can't build, but then we can.
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.000]  You've been given the ultimate secret.
[04:51.000 --> 05:01.000]  Well, they're right back with the huge news. Biggest coming news yet. It's devastating. Stay with us.
[05:01.000 --> 05:06.000]  It's our best seller. We first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller.
[05:06.000 --> 05:15.000]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller.
[05:15.000 --> 05:18.000]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[05:18.000 --> 05:25.000]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[05:25.000 --> 05:32.000]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[05:32.000 --> 05:38.000]  Essential means without these things you die. And so much of the food is debased. There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[05:38.000 --> 05:42.000]  It is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[05:42.000 --> 05:47.000]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the very best.
[05:47.000 --> 05:52.000]  And it's a low price, and it funds the InfoWare. So the only way you lose is not taking action today,
[05:52.000 --> 05:57.000]  getting vitamin mineral fusion finally back in stock at InfoWareStore.com for 50% off.
[05:57.000 --> 06:21.000]  Vitamin Refusion back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[06:21.000 --> 06:30.000]  It is Wednesday, October 12, 2022. We've been live since 8 a.m. this morning with the great Parrots and Smith.
[06:30.000 --> 06:37.000]  We'll go right through today through the War Room at 6 p.m. and then continue on until midnight tonight.
[06:37.000 --> 06:45.000]  That'll be 16 hours of live broadcast. We have a big group of amazing guests that we'll be telling you about later joining us
[06:45.000 --> 06:54.000]  throughout the entire day until midnight tonight. This is an emergency save InfoWare's 1776 broadcast.
[06:54.000 --> 07:00.000]  We have the Help Save InfoWare 1776 Super Sale is here. I've extended the big sale and expanded it,
[07:00.000 --> 07:11.000]  saved up to 50% off, plus double Patriot Points, store-wide, and, ladies and gentlemen, with the promo code 1776,

[07:23.000 --> 07:34.000]  vitamin mineral fusion, and a bunch of other items that are 50% off with promo code 1776 at checkout.
[07:34.000 --> 07:40.000]  An additional 10% is put on the top because we've got to move everything to fund our operations.
[07:40.000 --> 07:45.000]  As I said, we got into the black the last six months because of some big donations.
[07:45.000 --> 07:54.000]  Then because of supply chain breakdowns and some other issues, we got into the red again in the last month and legal bills and all of it.
[07:54.000 --> 08:02.000]  But thanks to listeners really supporting the last week, we're climbing towards barely being out of the red again.
[08:02.000 --> 08:10.000]  This is a sudden death over time football game or a video game and God's in control and making sure it's interesting because, let me tell you, it's always tread water.
[08:10.000 --> 08:15.000]  But thank you for your support. Thank you for everything you're doing. We were meant to be on air.
[08:15.000 --> 08:21.000]  My 28 years building up to this, our 28 years together, many of you have been listening more than 20, 25 years.
[08:21.000 --> 08:27.000]  It's now building towards this moment with the emergence of the New World Order and the world government.
[08:27.000 --> 08:35.000]  So please let everybody you know today via email via text messages. That's harder for them to censor via word of mouth via Instagram, Facebook, Twitter,
[08:35.000 --> 08:43.000]  that the forbidden man whose name you must not say is at info wars.com.
[08:43.000 --> 08:52.000]  And it's having a special emergency broadcast covering the most critical information ever.
[08:52.000 --> 09:00.000]  Do you want to support info wars store.com? Do you want to fund my personal legal bills that are 40% of all legal bills for free speech I've got to pay,
[09:00.000 --> 09:06.000]  which is I'm about almost out of money, then please go to save info wars.com as well.
[09:06.000 --> 09:10.000]  But regardless, keep info wars on the air and that is info wars store.com.
[09:10.000 --> 09:17.000]  I'm going to stop talking there and I'm going to just try to calmly get into this right now.
[09:17.000 --> 09:26.000]  This is actually this is actually going to take me most the first hour.
[09:26.000 --> 09:32.000]  And then I'll tell you about the special guests that are joining us.
[09:32.000 --> 09:36.000]  I say this every day because it's true.
[09:36.000 --> 09:38.000]  At least the last six months.
[09:38.000 --> 09:44.000]  Every day, the COVID news and what they did to us is bigger than all the previous news combined.
[09:44.000 --> 09:49.000]  It is, it is insane. It is all out the open. God is showing it to us.
[09:49.000 --> 09:53.000]  We have all these experts and all these patriots and all these good people that stood up and spoke out.
[09:53.000 --> 10:04.000]  And now they admit that the so called COVID vaccines, a racial immune system caused massive heart attacks, heart swelling, blood clots, cancer, infertility and literally hundreds of other horrible things.
[10:04.000 --> 10:14.000]  That's the highest death rate the Western world's ever seen worse in World War One, worse in World War Two, worse than Vietnam, all combined.
[10:14.000 --> 10:21.000]  They are murdering tens of millions of people in front of us and very prestigious scientists and statisticians have come out.
[10:21.000 --> 10:31.000]  We have the clips this hour and confirmed it's hundreds of millions dying from the shots right now worldwide.
[10:31.000 --> 10:38.000]  Now, before I hit all this breaking news, starting next segment for the rest of the hour,
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.000]  I want to talk about the philosophy of the Satanist and why they're doing this.
[10:42.000 --> 10:46.000]  It's very important to understand.
[10:46.000 --> 10:49.000]  It's beyond critical.
[10:49.000 --> 11:04.000]  They are hitting us at every level in a giant open air mad scientist laboratory.
[11:04.000 --> 11:12.000]  And they believe out of this massive attack on humanity, it is going to help them develop the secrets of the universe,
[11:12.000 --> 11:19.000]  whether it is the particles of the universe with the CERN, superconducting supercollider cyclotron,
[11:19.000 --> 11:24.000]  or whether it is weather control, which they admit they're doing, huge breaking news on that today,
[11:24.000 --> 11:31.000]  or whether it is the 5G and other systems taking over our bodies with these electromagnetic impulses,
[11:31.000 --> 11:40.000]  or whether it's physically taking over our bodies with these nanotech structures that are growing in us with the graphene oxide more that's totally confirmed,
[11:40.000 --> 11:46.000]  to the social attacks, the spiritual attacks, the economic attacks.
[11:46.000 --> 11:55.000]  Humanity is being put into a crisis phase, and the Luciferians believe that will then create the new Uber mention,
[11:55.000 --> 12:06.000]  and out of that, the few survivors will create the super genetic being that will then merge with the machines and become a new life form.
[12:06.000 --> 12:12.000]  And that's the religion of the new world order, I told you about it 25 years ago, Elon Musk's been talking about the last few years,
[12:12.000 --> 12:16.000]  people watch him on Joe Rogan and they put our interviews side by side, it's word for word what I'm saying,
[12:16.000 --> 12:21.000]  because Elon Musk knows whether he's one of them or not, I think the jury's out on that.
[12:21.000 --> 12:27.000]  When I'm telling you with this, this is not a game, and you don't need me to tell you this is going on,
[12:27.000 --> 12:32.000]  you can turn on the TV and hear the world will be better without humans, and the future is not human,
[12:32.000 --> 12:40.000]  and by 2047 will all be cyborgs are dead, and Google executives say you'll be obsolete if you don't merge the machines.
[12:40.000 --> 12:49.000]  This is a forced revolution against humanity, and if you don't resist it, and if you don't become aware of it,
[12:49.000 --> 12:56.000]  and if you don't change your life to be outside of it, and I'm telling myself that when I tell you,
[12:56.000 --> 13:04.000]  if you don't make those changes, you will be absorbed before you're destroyed,
[13:04.000 --> 13:10.000]  and in the process of having your psyche absorbed, you'll be put into a false reality where they believe they can trick you
[13:10.000 --> 13:15.000]  via free will to spiritually decide, that just means next dimensional level,
[13:15.000 --> 13:24.000]  decide to transfer your energy, your spirit, your interdimensional record into their realm.
[13:24.000 --> 13:30.000]  They are a lower dimension, a satanic destructive chaos dimension, sucking energy out of the higher dimensions,
[13:30.000 --> 13:42.000]  and the third dimension is the highest platform they can jack into, and our existence is only partially exhibited in the third dimension.
[13:42.000 --> 13:49.000]  This is only one small part of who we are, if you could see interdimensionally, you could see your spirit transcending,
[13:49.000 --> 13:58.000]  it looks like a waterfall of electromagnetic energy or fiber optics into the universe like a tree,
[13:58.000 --> 14:04.000]  fanning out into all consciousness. I've seen it, and I didn't even know, and I talked about it ten years ago,
[14:04.000 --> 14:10.000]  and everybody said, well that's the Gnostics, that's the visions of the psychic Christians in Rome,
[14:10.000 --> 14:16.000]  I hadn't read those writings, I saw what they saw, and beyond.
[14:16.000 --> 14:19.000]  I've gone beyond, I'm going to go ahead and just get all this out in the open.
[14:19.000 --> 14:22.000]  Why do you think the enemy hates me so much? Why do they want to destroy me so much?
[14:22.000 --> 14:28.000]  It's not for what I've done on air, that's nothing.
[14:28.000 --> 14:33.000]  I have gone to the third heaven, I have been in the third heaven that King David was transported to,
[14:33.000 --> 14:40.000]  I have seen it, I have seen heaven, I have seen the highest dimension, I have seen it,
[14:40.000 --> 14:47.000]  and God is there, and it's so powerful and so amazing, it's not interdimensionally like we think of as humans,
[14:47.000 --> 14:55.000]  you can't look at it so bright like Moses, it's that it's so powerful in the consciousness and so complete
[14:55.000 --> 14:59.000]  that you can't look at God and come back.
[14:59.000 --> 15:03.000]  That's why you can't look, because if you look, it's total completion,
[15:03.000 --> 15:07.000]  and you will be instantaneously impossible for you to come back.
[15:07.000 --> 15:10.000]  That's why you can't look at God. There's no coming back.
[15:10.000 --> 15:15.000]  It's all powerful, total consciousness, total goodness, total wisdom, absolute completion.
[15:15.000 --> 15:21.000]  Beyond any satisfaction you can ever imagine, infinity is like a trillionth of a second.
[15:21.000 --> 15:32.000]  It is unknowable, it is absolute, beyond any pleasure you could ever imagine.
[15:32.000 --> 15:38.000]  And they want to try to suck you down to their satanic dimension so you don't escape and get that,
[15:38.000 --> 15:41.000]  because they already know they're losers, they know they're never going to get that.
[15:41.000 --> 15:45.000]  I want you to be there with me and all our ancestors that went with God,
[15:45.000 --> 15:48.000]  we're going to be there together, vio condios, go with God.
[15:48.000 --> 15:53.000]  We'll be right back and I'll shift into temporal attacks and the new world order and the poison injections
[15:53.000 --> 16:00.000]  and the biggest news breaking ever on that front stage with us.
[16:00.000 --> 16:03.000]  I don't promote things unless they really work.
[16:03.000 --> 16:10.000]  When it comes to politics or culture, economics, we are always the cutting-edge tip of the spirit.
[16:10.000 --> 16:14.000]  And when we talk about the products at infomercial.com, they all blow you away.
[16:14.000 --> 16:18.000]  If you'll just take them, if you'll just try them, I know you'll be or be customers.
[16:18.000 --> 16:22.000]  And finally, one of our best selling products sold out for months back at Stockings X3.
[16:22.000 --> 16:29.000]  It's all the types of the very best atomic iodine out there that supercharges your energy,
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.000]  your stamina, your libido, and number one, your immune system.
[16:33.000 --> 16:42.000]  So X3, despite the fact it was a run on iodine, is still on sale at 50% off right now at infowarstore.com
[16:42.000 --> 16:45.000]  and it funds the info war, which is a 360 win.
[16:45.000 --> 16:49.000]  If you've not experienced the power of iodine, it takes two weeks to kick it on average.
[16:49.000 --> 16:53.000]  You've got to go to infowarstore.com and get X3 50% off.
[16:53.000 --> 17:00.000]  X3 50% off infowarstore.com
[17:23.000 --> 17:30.000]  as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[17:30.000 --> 17:34.000]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today
[17:34.000 --> 17:40.000]  is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[17:40.000 --> 17:44.000]  I don't take the credit. I give you the credit.
[17:44.000 --> 17:48.000]  And now info wars is facing its darkest hours. It isn't going to give up.
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.000]  Without your support, we can be shut down.
[17:50.000 --> 17:53.000]  Please go to saveinfowars.com today.
[17:53.000 --> 17:59.000]  Saveinfowars.com today and donate for our legal defense fund.
[17:59.000 --> 18:02.000]  Look, it's not hype that info wars has changed the world.
[18:02.000 --> 18:07.000]  It's not hype that your support of info wars is the reason we were able to do this.
[18:07.000 --> 18:09.000]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[18:09.000 --> 18:13.000]  Now you know about fluoride, the bad halogen on the periodic table.
[18:13.000 --> 18:17.000]  Well, high quality iodine is the good halogen and does the opposite of fluoride.
[18:17.000 --> 18:20.000]  And when you've got it in your body, it doesn't just supercharge your cells.
[18:20.000 --> 18:22.000]  It doesn't just give you more energy. It doesn't just boost your immune system.
[18:22.000 --> 18:28.000]  But it also blocks the bad halogens in the fluoride, chlorine, bromide, bromine family.
[18:28.000 --> 18:33.000]  So ladies and gentlemen, it takes about two weeks for X3 to kick in on average.

[19:01.000 --> 19:06.000]  I have been in the 28 year marathon battle with the globalist.
[19:06.000 --> 19:12.000]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[19:12.000 --> 19:17.000]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war.
[19:17.000 --> 19:20.000]  But I don't deserve the credit. Yes, I've persevered.
[19:20.000 --> 19:26.000]  But the listeners and viewers who support info wars are the real reason you have the success.
[19:26.000 --> 19:32.000]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new war you've ever had.
[19:32.000 --> 19:36.000]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[19:36.000 --> 19:41.000]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight
[19:41.000 --> 19:45.000]  and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify it.
[19:45.000 --> 19:52.000]  God bless you all. I salute you. I thank you. And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now
[19:52.000 --> 19:55.000]  because we are over the target and this dream is happening.
[19:55.000 --> 20:00.000]  The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight. God bless you all.
[20:00.000 --> 20:07.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:17.000 --> 20:21.000]  We now take you to the front lines of the fight for human consciousness.
[20:21.000 --> 20:25.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, broadcasting worldwide.
[20:25.000 --> 20:33.000]  All right, so the enemy knew when they launched their bio attack with the COVID-19, a very serious real attack,
[20:33.000 --> 20:38.000]  that once the first phase was ingested, they'd already done a mutation test,
[20:38.000 --> 20:44.000]  that by injecting these poison mRNA shots, it would force a mass mutation, that's mainline virology,
[20:44.000 --> 20:49.000]  that would actually create much deadlier strains instead of a natural progression.
[20:49.000 --> 20:56.000]  Normally viruses peak, become destructive and then the human population absorbs them,
[20:56.000 --> 21:01.000]  creates its own antibodies and defeats it and then the virus becomes weaker and weaker in the next few years.
[21:01.000 --> 21:08.000]  Instead, it became much more communicable and much more deadly in the last few years
[21:08.000 --> 21:13.000]  and then finally humanity overrode the deadly shots, the mutations that even defeated those.
[21:13.000 --> 21:23.000]  Also, somebody else in a laboratory that's all been confirmed a year ago released the next variant in Africa
[21:23.000 --> 21:32.000]  that had been genetically changed in more than 30 spots, that was basically a real open air vaccine
[21:32.000 --> 21:35.000]  that actually countered what the globalists had released.
[21:35.000 --> 21:38.000]  We don't know who those white hats are, but it was done.
[21:38.000 --> 21:42.000]  Or the globalists could have done it for some other reason, they thought their test was getting out of hand.
[21:42.000 --> 21:45.000]  We don't know, that's what the top scientists have confirmed.
[21:45.000 --> 21:49.000]  Just like they knew two and a half years ago the virus was made in a lab, they looked at that new variant
[21:49.000 --> 21:54.000]  and they said this is man-made too and it goes in and basically inoculates people.
[21:54.000 --> 21:57.000]  So that's what's been unfolding there.
[21:57.000 --> 22:00.000]  Here's the ultra-giant news.
[22:00.000 --> 22:05.000]  We already know this huge news, but now the news is being pushed, now it's breaking through
[22:05.000 --> 22:11.000]  in just a gigantic way, a colossal way, a gargantuan way.
[22:11.000 --> 22:18.000]  And that is that it wasn't a vaccine, it erases your immune system, they knew it would hurt you,
[22:18.000 --> 22:23.000]  they'd already tested it on animals, they lied and said they hadn't tested it.
[22:23.000 --> 22:27.000]  And so to get away with the fact that they had tested it and it hurt people, they said,
[22:27.000 --> 22:34.000]  no, we haven't tested it, but warp speed, and here's the big line, it will protect you.
[22:34.000 --> 22:39.000]  Now they can walk it back now and say, well, we told you we didn't know it would work in the fine print.
[22:39.000 --> 22:41.000]  That's how we knew two and a half years ago it wouldn't work.
[22:41.000 --> 22:42.000]  We read the fine print.
[22:42.000 --> 22:44.000]  Top scientists read the fine print.
[22:44.000 --> 22:46.000]  We said it's not going to work, it doesn't work, they know it doesn't work.
[22:46.000 --> 22:48.000]  Oh, shut up, you're censored, you're a liar.
[22:48.000 --> 22:52.000]  But again, they had to admit that early on in fine print so when it came out it didn't work,
[22:52.000 --> 22:55.000]  they would have plausible anonymity and say, well, we kind of told you.
[22:55.000 --> 22:56.000]  See how that works?
[22:56.000 --> 23:03.000]  But they had governments all signed on for total liability protection to the so-called vaccine big pharma makers
[23:03.000 --> 23:07.000]  so they could then fully corrupt the governments who've signed on to mass murder.
[23:07.000 --> 23:12.000]  Now instead of them getting in trouble, they get even more power because they've committed the entire human structure
[23:12.000 --> 23:16.000]  of the power structure to the mass murder, to the genocide.
[23:16.000 --> 23:19.000]  Now they can blackmail them and control them.
[23:19.000 --> 23:22.000]  That's how this satanic logic works.
[23:22.000 --> 23:27.000]  But if people understand that compendium and the entire manipulation, the globalists go down
[23:27.000 --> 23:30.000]  instead of being able to launch this and then get away with it.
[23:30.000 --> 23:39.000]  And so they desperately, desperately, desperately, desperately needed this to roll out in the early phases before it got exposed.
[23:39.000 --> 23:44.000]  But because it did get exposed early, the majority of people did not take the poison shots.
[23:44.000 --> 23:46.000]  Now almost no one's taking the poison shots.
[23:46.000 --> 23:49.000]  And so their plan did not get executed the way they want.
[23:49.000 --> 23:50.000]  It blew up in their face.
[23:50.000 --> 23:51.000]  It's still been devastating.
[23:51.000 --> 23:53.000]  It's still killed tens of millions.
[23:53.000 --> 23:57.000]  But now it's backfiring on them in ways they didn't expect.
[23:57.000 --> 24:01.000]  And humanity that was asleep at the switch is now waking up.
[24:01.000 --> 24:03.000]  So here's the big news.
[24:03.000 --> 24:10.000]  In the European Union, as I told you a few weeks ago, they've demanded that these Pfizer executives and Moderna executives
[24:10.000 --> 24:11.000]  and others testify.
[24:11.000 --> 24:18.000]  And Albert Borla, the head of Pfizer, truly evil man, he was going to testify last week.
[24:18.000 --> 24:20.000]  He then refused, didn't show up.
[24:20.000 --> 24:24.000]  So the hearings are happening last week and this week in the European Union Parliament.
[24:24.000 --> 24:31.000]  And they are being eviscerated in there by reminding them that they went on TV, the executives,
[24:31.000 --> 24:36.000]  the politicians, all of them, and read the script, put out by Pfizer and Moderna and Bill Gates
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  and Peter Dasek and the EcoHealth Alliance.
[24:38.000 --> 24:43.000]  And in Fauci, all the same ringleader criminals involved in making the virus, releasing it,
[24:43.000 --> 24:45.000]  running the global union response.
[24:45.000 --> 24:47.000]  Here's the key.
[24:47.000 --> 24:52.000]  They're now saying, well, we told you from the beginning it wasn't going to work.
[24:52.000 --> 24:53.000]  No, no, no, no.
[24:53.000 --> 24:56.000]  You said at the beginning you didn't know if it would work.
[24:56.000 --> 25:02.000]  But you lied and censored anybody that pointed that out and told everybody 96% effective,
[25:02.000 --> 25:09.000]  84% effective, 72% effective, 67% effective, 51% effective, 44% effective.
[25:09.000 --> 25:16.000]  And now they go, well, actually it makes you get COVID and makes you sick and gives you an eight times chance of dying.
[25:16.000 --> 25:19.000]  They knew that day one and they're trying to play games.
[25:19.000 --> 25:25.000]  If you're going to bio-attack people with a virus and then the vaccine that's even worse, it's not a vaccine.
[25:25.000 --> 25:28.000]  You've got to have a story of how you messed up.
[25:28.000 --> 25:29.000]  And here's the key.
[25:29.000 --> 25:31.000]  Keep key two.
[25:31.000 --> 25:38.000]  They intended, and it's in the Spars 2025-2028 document war game, they intended this to break the social contract
[25:38.000 --> 25:43.000]  and make everyone hate the government and cause civil war worldwide.
[25:43.000 --> 25:48.000]  But if people know it's a master plan to create the civil war, we don't blow up our government.
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  We don't burn things down.
[25:50.000 --> 25:57.000]  We politically take control and then prosecute and then execute the war criminals after they've had a trial,
[25:57.000 --> 26:00.000]  after they've been given appeals, everything.
[26:00.000 --> 26:06.000]  But yes, obviously the people that launched these bio-attacks need to be arrested, need to be tried and need to be executed.
[26:06.000 --> 26:10.000]  My God, if there's a death penalty out there, it's for these people.
[26:10.000 --> 26:14.000]  As an example to other criminals like them, you want to kill tens of millions of us?
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  You want to main billions of people?
[26:16.000 --> 26:19.000]  We're going to hang your ass on international television.
[26:19.000 --> 26:23.000]  There'll be seven billion viewers when you're swinging at the end of a rope.
[26:23.000 --> 26:27.000]  And yes, I'm saying it, they need to be executed.
[26:27.000 --> 26:30.000]  But nobody should bomb them, nobody should shoot them.
[26:30.000 --> 26:33.000]  In fact, they'll probably do it themselves, play victim.
[26:33.000 --> 26:39.000]  We take our governments back, we indict them, we arrest them, we try them, and then we hang their asses.
[26:39.000 --> 26:42.000]  Now, yeah, gloves are off, folks.
[26:42.000 --> 26:48.000]  So they all need to swing from an end of a rope if we've got any future.
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  They hit us with a damn bio-weapon.
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  They killed members of my family.
[26:52.000 --> 26:56.000]  They almost killed some of my best friends.
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  I've had all sorts of crap in my life.
[26:58.000 --> 26:59.000]  Let me tell you, this is a bio-weapon.
[26:59.000 --> 27:01.000]  I was gulping for air for two weeks, I couldn't breathe.
[27:01.000 --> 27:05.000]  I still did the show, I said, screw it.
[27:05.000 --> 27:09.000]  But the point is, is I just walked through all that, you understand?
[27:09.000 --> 27:12.000]  And I'm going to come back in the longer segment.
[27:12.000 --> 27:18.000]  I'm going to play you a compilation of these murdering New World Order criminals.
[27:18.000 --> 27:25.000]  These murdering New World Order criminals telling you two years ago and a year ago, this thing is 100% effective.
[27:25.000 --> 27:29.000]  If you take this, you will be protected when they knew damn well it wouldn't protect you.
[27:29.000 --> 27:32.000]  And the fine print, they said it.
[27:32.000 --> 27:36.000]  Now, they can try to go back and say, oh, but we told you we didn't know of work.
[27:36.000 --> 27:41.000]  But you did go on TV and you did put out press releases saying it would work.
[27:41.000 --> 27:45.000]  You didn't come out and say, we have no idea if this will work or not.
[27:45.000 --> 27:48.000]  When their own internal documents said it's going to cause heart attacks, heart swelling,
[27:48.000 --> 27:54.000]  blood clots, strokes and everything else you can imagine in the government's own documents October 2000, CDC.
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.000]  So they fine printed this to cover their asses, but people are smart.
[27:58.000 --> 28:00.000]  That doesn't cover your ass.
[28:00.000 --> 28:04.000]  Just because you leave a note with mommy that you're going to go rob a bank,
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  doesn't mean it's okay for you to rob a bank.
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.000]  You bureaucratic little monsters.
[28:08.000 --> 28:13.000]  You greedy bastards that think there's too many people and you're going to decide who dies.
[28:13.000 --> 28:18.000]  They're murderers. They're psychopaths. They're killers.
[28:18.000 --> 28:23.000]  So when I get up here and talk about how they need to be executed, I don't sit up there and say that to act tough.
[28:23.000 --> 28:30.000]  I say it because it's justice and it's what's right, but no extrajudicial violence.
[28:30.000 --> 28:39.000]  Indicted, arrested, tried, public execution, public execution.
[28:39.000 --> 28:45.000]  These people make Hitler blush and they must be brought to justice.
[28:45.000 --> 28:49.000]  Now they want to come clean.
[28:49.000 --> 28:55.000]  They can be given life in prison, but only those that blow the whistle will be given life in prison.
[28:55.000 --> 28:59.000]  Everyone else needs to be executed.
[28:59.000 --> 29:02.000]  I don't promote things unless they really work.
[29:02.000 --> 29:09.000]  When it comes to politics or culture, economics, we are always the cutting edge of the tip of the spear.
[29:09.000 --> 29:13.000]  And when we talk about the products in infomercial.com, they all blow you away.
[29:13.000 --> 29:17.000]  If you'll just take them, if you'll just try them, I know you'll be real big customers.
[29:17.000 --> 29:22.000]  And finally, one of our best selling products sold out for months back at Stockings X3.
[29:22.000 --> 29:26.000]  It's all three types of the very best atomic iodine out there.
[29:26.000 --> 29:32.000]  It supercharges your energy, your stamina, your libido, and number one, your immune system.

[29:42.000 --> 29:45.000]  And it funds the info war, which is a 360 win.
[29:45.000 --> 29:49.000]  If you've not experienced the power of iodine, it takes two weeks to kick it on average.

[29:52.000 --> 29:57.000]  X3 50% off infowarstore.com.
[30:23.000 --> 30:29.000]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[30:29.000 --> 30:32.000]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations,
[30:32.000 --> 30:36.000]  but I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees,
[30:36.000 --> 30:40.000]  and I can't fund those myself. It's unsustainable.
[30:40.000 --> 30:44.000]  So please visit saveinfowarstore.com.

[31:13.000 --> 31:15.000]  And over the years, you have come to the table.

[31:20.000 --> 31:21.000]  And I thank you.
[31:21.000 --> 31:25.000]  But now I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them,
[31:25.000 --> 31:26.000]  and I need your support.
[31:26.000 --> 31:29.000]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward,

[31:43.000 --> 31:45.000]  This whole phase of their attacks,
[31:45.000 --> 31:47.000]  four years in the making is almost over.
[31:47.000 --> 31:49.000]  And right at the end, we're not giving up.
[31:49.000 --> 31:51.000]  We're not giving in, but we could give out.
[31:51.000 --> 31:56.000]  So please, if you support what we're doing and want to fight for liberty and freedom in just in the future,

[32:02.000 --> 32:07.000]  It's not hype that your support of info wars is the reason we were able to do this.
[32:07.000 --> 32:08.000]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[32:08.000 --> 32:13.000]  Now, you know about fluoride, the bad halogen on the periodic table.
[32:13.000 --> 32:16.000]  Well, high quality iodine is the good halogen and does the opposite of fluoride.
[32:16.000 --> 32:19.000]  And when you've got it in your body, it doesn't just supercharge your cells,
[32:19.000 --> 32:22.000]  it doesn't just give you more energy, it doesn't just boost your immune system,
[32:22.000 --> 32:28.000]  but it also blocks the bad halogens in the fluoride, chlorine, bromide, bromine family.
[32:28.000 --> 32:32.000]  So ladies and gentlemen, it takes about two weeks for X3 to kick in on average,
[32:32.000 --> 32:36.000]  taking few drops every day, and almost everyone has dramatic results.
[32:36.000 --> 32:38.000]  Plus, it funds the info war.

[32:53.000 --> 33:11.000]  Learn how to counter the fluoride and fund the info war and empower your life at infowarstore.com.
[33:11.000 --> 33:24.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:24.000 --> 33:30.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:30.000 --> 33:42.000]  So I know I put my life and my family's life in God's hands when I call for the prosecution seeing the death penalty for releasing bio weapons on the public against the globalist,
[33:42.000 --> 33:48.000]  but you've seen Senator Paul's hearings where they bring out that they created a bio weapon on record.
[33:48.000 --> 33:54.000]  It's in all the documents, they lied to Congress and they released the damn thing on us and they gave us a shot even worse.
[33:54.000 --> 33:56.000]  I mean, are we going to sit there and take this?
[33:56.000 --> 34:00.000]  No more half measures, no more games with these people.
[34:00.000 --> 34:03.000]  Multiple members of our crew almost died.
[34:03.000 --> 34:07.000]  Rob Doe almost died.
[34:07.000 --> 34:09.000]  I had family members that died.
[34:09.000 --> 34:12.000]  The New World Order killed members of my family.
[34:12.000 --> 34:16.000]  They killed members of your family and with their shots they killed even more people.
[34:16.000 --> 34:17.000]  Let that sink in.
[34:17.000 --> 34:20.000]  So I won't go down as a coward.
[34:20.000 --> 34:23.000]  I won't sit here and do half measures.
[34:23.000 --> 34:32.000]  I want to trigger people instinctively to get in the mindset spiritually of understanding you're under attack.
[34:32.000 --> 34:34.000]  And the evil on this planet is not all powerful.
[34:34.000 --> 34:38.000]  We have God on our side and God's watching.
[34:38.000 --> 34:49.000]  So we've known before they rolled out the poison shots, the Franken shots, they would do this because the globalist, again, like admit what they're going to do before they do it metaphysically, it's a rule they have.
[34:49.000 --> 34:52.000]  And I already went into the reasons earlier.
[34:52.000 --> 35:04.000]  So now they want to destroy confidence in government and systems and create all sorts of hate and despair and soft killed half dead people to bring down civilization.
[35:04.000 --> 35:10.000]  They want to move on to the next thing, inflation and war and collapsing borders and crime and all the rest of it.
[35:10.000 --> 35:20.000]  When they're the ones that created the policies on record that created that on record, right down the line.
[35:20.000 --> 35:33.000]  But the good news is in Latin America, in Africa, in Asia, in the Middle East, in Europe, in Russia, in the United States, in Mexico, in Canada.
[35:33.000 --> 35:47.000]  We have leaders, not just Bolsonaro, not just DeSantis, but the Mexican president coming out and saying big farmers behind these shots and these shots are hurting people and young people shouldn't take them.
[35:47.000 --> 35:51.000]  They're saying if you're an adult, you want to hurt yourself, go ahead, but young people shouldn't be taking it.
[35:51.000 --> 35:55.000]  That's the Mexican president because he's got a soul.
[35:55.000 --> 36:00.000]  And when it comes to actually killing kids, these guys put their lives in their hands.
[36:00.000 --> 36:09.000]  They killed five African presidents, two of them were doctors that came out and pointed out this is all a scam and a fraud.
[36:09.000 --> 36:12.000]  And Ivermectin was the answer, the shots were killing people.
[36:12.000 --> 36:14.000]  They killed five of them.
[36:14.000 --> 36:17.000]  And then a Haiti came out and said it was a fraud, don't take the shot.
[36:17.000 --> 36:22.000]  And they came to his house and tortured him to death and blew his head off.
[36:22.000 --> 36:30.000]  So this is extremely dangerous to fight, but it's way more dangerous to go along with these people.
[36:30.000 --> 36:32.000]  I'm not going to wait till they release the next virus.
[36:32.000 --> 36:41.000]  I'm not going to wait till the next lockdown and just sit there and cower in my house, hoping my family doesn't die from the next weapon that the New World Order and Bill Gates released.
[36:41.000 --> 36:44.000]  No, sir, not going to happen.
[36:44.000 --> 36:53.000]  We're going to expose these monsters and we're going to beat them.
[36:53.000 --> 37:03.000]  So you can be with DeSantis in Bolsonaro and the Mexican president, or you can be with Bill Gates and Fauci in the New World Order.
[37:03.000 --> 37:05.000]  Who are you going to be with?
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  China won't take these mRNA shots.
[37:07.000 --> 37:11.000]  Russia won't take the mRNA shots because they knew.
[37:11.000 --> 37:13.000]  Our own governments hate us.
[37:13.000 --> 37:14.000]  They're not our governments.
[37:14.000 --> 37:16.000]  They've been hijacked by criminals.
[37:16.000 --> 37:20.000]  And if they can trick us that it's the government that's the enemy and get a civil war going, they win.
[37:20.000 --> 37:26.000]  If a hijacker jumps up with a bomb and a machine gun on the plane and takes over the pilot and co-pilot, you don't blame the airline.
[37:26.000 --> 37:27.000]  You don't blame the pilots.
[37:27.000 --> 37:30.000]  You blame the terrorist.
[37:30.000 --> 37:42.000]  And the New World Order that's hijacked our country has the same legitimacy as a hijacker that's taken over a jumbo jet, which is zero credibility.
[37:42.000 --> 37:44.000]  Everything they said was a lie on purpose.
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  Everything was a systematic fraud.
[37:46.000 --> 37:47.000]  They blocked therapeutics.
[37:47.000 --> 37:48.000]  They censored the truth.
[37:48.000 --> 37:51.000]  The big tech and the media aided and abetted and murdered.
[37:51.000 --> 37:58.000]  So all you trendy liberals that love your paycheck and love feeling like you're a part of the power structure, you're mass murderers now.
[37:58.000 --> 38:01.000]  How does it feel to be mass murderers?
[38:01.000 --> 38:05.000]  There'll be a cost spiritually for what you've done.
[38:05.000 --> 38:06.000]  But don't worry.
[38:06.000 --> 38:10.000]  You're not going to have to wait till you leave this body to be punished.
[38:10.000 --> 38:22.000]  You'll be punished by destroying your own nest, going along with evil, pretending like you were part of the power structure and destroying your own future in the process, you idiots.
[38:22.000 --> 38:25.000]  So let's start getting to the clips.
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.000]  Again, they're trying to do a bait and switcher.
[38:27.000 --> 38:28.000]  Well, we told you it.
[38:28.000 --> 38:29.000]  We didn't test it.
[38:29.000 --> 38:30.000]  It wouldn't might not work.
[38:30.000 --> 38:31.000]  We didn't know it would work.
[38:31.000 --> 38:39.000]  No, you said it would totally work and you lied on purpose and you suppressed those that said it would and had major risk.
[38:39.000 --> 38:40.000]  That's the truth.
[38:40.000 --> 38:47.000]  So here's a compilation of some of the new world order scumbags reading off their, their, their talking points about, oh, you take the shot.
[38:47.000 --> 38:48.000]  You're protected.
[38:48.000 --> 38:49.000]  Here it is.
[38:49.000 --> 39:04.000]  During 2021, we should be able to manufacture a lot of vaccines and, and that vaccine, a key goal is to stop the transmission to get the immunity levels up so that you get almost no, almost no infection going on whatsoever.
[39:04.000 --> 39:13.000]  Everyone who takes the vaccine is not just protecting themselves, but reducing their transmission to other people and allowing society to get back to normal.
[39:13.000 --> 39:25.000]  We kind of almost see the end where we're vaccinating so very fast, our data from the CDC today suggests, you know, that, that vaccinated people do not carry the virus, don't get sick.
[39:25.000 --> 39:31.000]  Now we know that the vaccines work well enough that the virus stops with every vaccinated person.
[39:31.000 --> 39:34.000]  A vaccinated person gets exposed to the virus.
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  The virus does not infect them.
[39:36.000 --> 39:39.000]  The virus cannot then use that person to go anywhere else.
[39:39.000 --> 39:42.000]  It cannot use a vaccinated person as a host to go get more people.
[39:42.000 --> 39:47.000]  That means the vaccines will get us to the end of this.
[39:47.000 --> 39:53.000]  Essentially, vaccines block you from getting and giving the virus.
[39:53.000 --> 40:01.000]  Fully vaccinated people are at a very, very low risk of getting COVID-19.
[40:01.000 --> 40:07.000]  Therefore, if you've been fully vaccinated, you no longer need to wear a mask.
[40:07.000 --> 40:11.000]  When people are vaccinated, they can feel safe that they are not going to get infected.
[40:11.000 --> 40:14.000]  We have all the vaccines we need.
[40:14.000 --> 40:17.000]  We just need our people to take it.
[40:17.000 --> 40:25.000]  A, for their own protection, for the protection of their family, but also to break the chain of transmission.
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  You want to be a dead end to the virus.
[40:27.000 --> 40:30.000]  So when the virus gets to you, you stop it.
[40:30.000 --> 40:36.000]  You don't allow it to use you as the stepping stone to the next person.
[40:36.000 --> 40:43.000]  I think given the country as a whole, the fact that we have now about 50% of adults fully vaccinated
[40:43.000 --> 40:49.000]  and about 62% of adults having received at least one dose as a nation,
[40:49.000 --> 40:55.000]  I feel fairly certain you're not going to see the kind of surges we've seen in the past.
[40:55.000 --> 40:59.000]  If you're vaccinated, you're not going to be hospitalized.
[40:59.000 --> 41:02.000]  You're not going to be an ICU unit, and you're not going to die.
[41:02.000 --> 41:09.000]  You're okay. You're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations.
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.000]  You're okay. You're not going to get COVID.
[41:11.000 --> 41:14.000]  Now you're more likely to get COVID, more likely to be hospitalized,
[41:14.000 --> 41:19.000]  and in the studies, eight times more likely to die.
[41:19.000 --> 41:23.000]  Because the shot gives you COVID, ladies and gentlemen.
[41:23.000 --> 41:28.000]  Now when we come back, clips from the parliamentary hearings in the European Union.
[41:28.000 --> 41:33.000]  Remember, the EU was set up during a steel deal in the 56th Treaty of Rome.
[41:33.000 --> 41:36.000]  So it's a dictatorship, but they said, oh, but you'll have a ceremonial parliament.
[41:36.000 --> 41:39.000]  Well, ceremonial is still powerful because it's a bully pulpit,
[41:39.000 --> 41:43.000]  and now they're destroying Pfizer and Moderna in these hearings,
[41:43.000 --> 41:46.000]  and having them admit we never tested it.
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.000]  We didn't know if it would work or not, but we told people it would.
[41:50.000 --> 41:53.000]  That's the key. They lied.
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  And they're doing this bait and switch.
[41:55.000 --> 41:59.000]  We're going to go to break, ladies and gentlemen. We're going to come back and play all these clips straight ahead.
[41:59.000 --> 42:03.000]  I'm going to open the phones up again. I've got a bunch of big guests I'll tell you about coming up.
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  We're going to figure out which times they're on today.
[42:05.000 --> 42:09.000]  We're going live until midnight tonight. It's the Save InfoWars extended emergency broadcast.

[42:59.000 --> 43:01.000]  It's our best seller.
[43:01.000 --> 43:05.000]  We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller.
[43:05.000 --> 43:11.000]  But as folks tried Vitamin Refusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made them,
[43:11.000 --> 43:14.000]  it has become our number one overall best seller.
[43:14.000 --> 43:17.000]  And it's been sold out for a while but it's finally back in stock.

[43:31.000 --> 43:33.000]  Essential means without these things you die.
[43:33.000 --> 43:35.000]  And so much of the food is debased.
[43:35.000 --> 43:37.000]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[43:37.000 --> 43:41.000]  It is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[43:41.000 --> 43:44.000]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there.

[44:26.000 --> 44:31.000]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order you've ever had.
[44:31.000 --> 44:36.000]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[44:36.000 --> 44:41.000]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight
[44:41.000 --> 44:45.000]  and to continue in the efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify them.
[44:45.000 --> 44:46.000]  God bless you all.
[44:46.000 --> 44:47.000]  I salute you.
[44:47.000 --> 44:48.000]  I thank you.
[44:48.000 --> 44:54.000]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[44:54.000 --> 44:56.000]  The fight is my fight.
[44:56.000 --> 44:57.000]  It's your fight.
[44:57.000 --> 44:58.000]  It's our fight.
[44:58.000 --> 44:59.000]  God bless you all.
[44:59.000 --> 45:05.000]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the Globalist.
[45:05.000 --> 45:12.000]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[45:12.000 --> 45:17.000]  We are engaging the Globalist at point-blank range in the information war.
[45:17.000 --> 45:19.000]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[45:19.000 --> 45:26.000]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support them for war are the real reason you've had the success.
[45:26.000 --> 45:32.000]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order you've ever had.
[45:32.000 --> 45:36.000]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[45:36.000 --> 45:41.000]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight
[45:41.000 --> 45:45.000]  and to continue in the efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify them.
[45:45.000 --> 45:51.000]  God bless you all, I salute you, I thank you, and I beg you to intensify what you're doing now
[45:51.000 --> 45:54.000]  because we are over the target and history is happening.
[45:54.000 --> 45:56.000]  The fight is my fight.
[45:56.000 --> 45:57.000]  It's your fight.
[45:57.000 --> 45:58.000]  It's our fight.
[45:58.000 --> 46:16.000]  Look around you, everything I predicted from the Globalist documents, from their own admissions is now happening.
[46:16.000 --> 46:28.000]  The boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits stay on air, but now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[46:28.000 --> 46:30.000]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[46:30.000 --> 46:37.000]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees,
[46:37.000 --> 46:39.000]  and I can't fund those myself.
[46:39.000 --> 46:40.000]  It's unsustainable.
[46:40.000 --> 46:51.000]  So please visit SaveMFullWars.com, SaveMFullWars.com, where you can make straight donations, 5, 10, $500, whatever you can,
[46:51.000 --> 46:53.000]  so that I can continue to persevere.
[46:53.000 --> 46:56.000]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[46:56.000 --> 46:57.000]  Thank you for your support.
[46:57.000 --> 46:58.000]  Wouldn't be without you.
[46:58.000 --> 47:26.000]  SaveMFullWars.com.
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.000]  God's waiting on you to take action.
[47:28.000 --> 47:29.000]  All you got to do is pray.
[47:29.000 --> 47:31.000]  All you got to do is spread the word.
[47:31.000 --> 47:39.000]  All you got to do is not submit and build the New World against the counterfeit New World that Satan's trying to construct on the ashes of humanity
[47:39.000 --> 47:41.000]  with the Build Back Better Great Reset agenda.
[47:41.000 --> 47:42.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[47:42.000 --> 47:48.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Wednesday, October 12th, Global Transmission.
[47:48.000 --> 47:51.000]  Okay, so really good news.
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  We've known the battle plan from the beginning.
[47:53.000 --> 47:54.000]  We've studied the enemy.
[47:54.000 --> 47:55.000]  We've been proven right.
[47:55.000 --> 47:56.000]  It's not hard.
[47:56.000 --> 47:57.000]  You can figure out the battle plan too.
[47:57.000 --> 47:59.000]  Don't need me to tell it to you.
[47:59.000 --> 48:04.000]  Once you understand that they think you're dumb, they think you're an animal, their arrogance will be their undoing.
[48:04.000 --> 48:08.000]  They also like to act powerful in front of their minions, so they admit it all in white papers,
[48:08.000 --> 48:12.000]  so their minions won't be scared to carry out mass murder and criminal activity.
[48:12.000 --> 48:19.000]  So there's other reasons they do it as well, not just Hootspa or arrogance or bravada,
[48:19.000 --> 48:23.000]  or all the other deadly sins of arrogance.
[48:23.000 --> 48:31.000]  So here we are in the space-time continuum, and you have the Pfizer executives,
[48:31.000 --> 48:35.000]  not the CEO, he wouldn't show up, but others has been like, yeah, we didn't test it.
[48:35.000 --> 48:40.000]  Oh, but you knew it would work and was first 100% effective, the 96% effective,
[48:40.000 --> 48:45.000]  and then, oh, it actually gives you the virus, it makes you sick, and it kills you in many cases.
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  So let's go to these clips here.
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  This is a key clip.
[48:49.000 --> 48:53.000]  This is a member of the European Union Parliament, Rob Roos.
[48:53.000 --> 48:59.000]  Pfizer admits the vaccine ability to prevent transmissions never tested, but they lie to the public.
[48:59.000 --> 49:00.000]  Here it is.
[49:00.000 --> 49:06.000]  For the first time, Pfizer admitted that the vaccine was not tested on stopping the transmission of the virus
[49:06.000 --> 49:10.000]  when it entered the market, and this has massive implications.
[49:10.000 --> 49:21.000]  Governments pushed millions of people worldwide to get vaccinated by telling them to do it for your grandmother,
[49:21.000 --> 49:27.000]  and they perfectly held the young people into taking this jab using false arguments,
[49:27.000 --> 49:34.000]  and they used big words such as anti-social to solve immense hatred against people
[49:34.000 --> 49:39.000]  who refused to comply with government's wishes, and even worse, many governments, including mine,
[49:39.000 --> 49:43.000]  actually introduced so-called COVID passports.
[49:43.000 --> 49:47.000]  These passports made access to parts of society conditional.
[49:47.000 --> 49:51.000]  Those who did not wish to get vaccinated lost that access,
[49:51.000 --> 49:56.000]  not being able to visit a restaurant or a gym, all in the name of public health.
[49:56.000 --> 50:05.000]  Our governments love to talk about institutional discrimination, but this was real institutional discrimination.
[50:05.000 --> 50:12.000]  In many countries, like the U.S. and Italy, vaccine mandates were introduced for certain professions.
[50:12.000 --> 50:19.000]  Many people lost their job, their livelihood, their business, because they stood by their principles.
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  Now, what he's saying here is key.
[50:21.000 --> 50:25.000]  We're trained to think of discrimination for what color you are, and that goes on, it's wrong,
[50:25.000 --> 50:29.000]  but this is discrimination against people that are smart and say no,
[50:29.000 --> 50:33.000]  but we're only trained to go, oh, it's discrimination, we don't chop an eight-year-old's balls off,
[50:33.000 --> 50:38.000]  or a ten-year-old girl's breast off, oh, let her chop her breast off because the government told her to,
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  and tricked her to, that's a right.
[50:40.000 --> 50:46.000]  Oh, let the NSA spy on you, let big tech spy on you, but we're also going to forcibly put an injection in you.
[50:46.000 --> 50:51.000]  And PayPal is going to surveil what you say on your website or what you say on Facebook,
[50:51.000 --> 50:54.000]  and if they don't like it, they're going to find you $2,500.
[50:54.000 --> 50:59.000]  That's discrimination for what you're thinking, mind discrimination, for your views, for your religion,
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  for your economic ideas.
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  Now, here's the clip that I wanted to get to.
[51:03.000 --> 51:06.000]  Here's the same member of parliament making a quick statement,
[51:06.000 --> 51:13.000]  and then showing the clip of where he confronted the spokesperson of Pfizer when Albert Borla wouldn't show up.
[51:13.000 --> 51:17.000]  If you don't get vaccinated, you're anti-social.
[51:17.000 --> 51:21.000]  This is what the Dutch Prime Minister and Health Minister told us.
[51:21.000 --> 51:25.000]  You don't get vaccinated just for yourself, but also for others.
[51:25.000 --> 51:28.000]  You do it for all of society.
[51:28.000 --> 51:33.000]  That's what I said. Today, this turned out to be complete nonsense.
[51:33.000 --> 51:39.000]  In a COVID hearing in the European Parliament, one of the Pfizer directors just admitted to me,
[51:39.000 --> 51:46.000]  at the time of introduction, the vaccine had never been tested on stopping the transmission of the virus.
[51:46.000 --> 51:50.000]  This removes the entire legal basis for the COVID passport,
[51:50.000 --> 51:58.000]  the COVID passport that led to massive institutional discrimination as people lost access to essential parts of society.
[51:58.000 --> 52:02.000]  I find this to be shocking, even criminal.
[52:02.000 --> 52:05.000]  Please watch the video until the end.
[52:05.000 --> 52:10.000]  For you, Mrs. Mol, I have the following question, which I want to answer clearly.
[52:10.000 --> 52:14.000]  And I will speak in English, so there are no misunderstandings.
[52:14.000 --> 52:26.000]  Was the Pfizer COVID vaccine tested on stopping the transmission of the virus before it entered the market?
[52:26.000 --> 52:29.000]  If not, please say it clearly.
[52:29.000 --> 52:33.000]  If yes, are you willing to share the data with this committee?
[52:33.000 --> 52:38.000]  And I really want a straight answer, yes or no, and I'm looking forward to it.
[52:38.000 --> 52:40.000]  Thank you very much.
[52:40.000 --> 52:46.000]  Regarding the question around, did we know about stopping humanisation before it entered the market?
[52:46.000 --> 52:55.000]  No. We had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market.
[52:55.000 --> 53:04.000]  This is scandalous. Millions of people worldwide felt forced to get vaccinated because of the myth that you do it for others.
[53:04.000 --> 53:07.000]  Now this turned out to be a cheap lie.
[53:07.000 --> 53:11.000]  This should be exposed. Please share this video.
[53:11.000 --> 53:18.000]  The speed of science. We own the science. We are the science. Science is all about questioning.
[53:18.000 --> 53:22.000]  And science is real, it's slow.
[53:22.000 --> 53:25.000]  But notice the arrogance of these monsters.
[53:25.000 --> 53:28.000]  Yes, Mrs. Small truly has a small soul.
[53:28.000 --> 53:35.000]  Now here is one of the top scientists and respected doctors in Australia.
[53:35.000 --> 53:37.000]  For decades he's been a big pundit on TV.
[53:37.000 --> 53:40.000]  He came out two years ago and gets what's happening. He's been proven right.
[53:40.000 --> 53:45.000]  Here's Dr. Roger Hawkinson saying 20 million dead worldwide from the jab.
[53:45.000 --> 53:50.000]  2.2 billion injured worldwide. This clip is beyond critical.
[53:50.000 --> 54:04.000]  One of the big pieces of news over the last couple of days is being a sub-stack by a gentleman called Peter Halligan.
[54:04.000 --> 54:13.000]  He's a most experienced analyst in the financial industry.
[54:13.000 --> 54:22.000]  Extremely used to looking at statistics and translating them into a summary statement.
[54:22.000 --> 54:29.000]  And this is the summary statement and I hope your leaders are sitting down holding themselves.
[54:29.000 --> 54:34.000]  Because what I'm going to tell you intuitively sounds ridiculous.
[54:34.000 --> 54:39.000]  That's why it's so incredibly important that I say this.
[54:39.000 --> 54:55.000]  These numbers are best estimates at this point in time using government data for the global consequences of the clout shot in terms of death and morbidity.
[54:55.000 --> 55:08.000]  We've been focusing for good reason on North American statistics during the last two and a half years.
[55:08.000 --> 55:18.000]  But this man has extrapolated that into the total negative effect of the clout shot.
[55:18.000 --> 55:30.000]  And these are the numbers. Deaths, global deaths directly attributable to the vaccine.
[55:30.000 --> 55:41.000]  20 million, two zero million deaths due to the clout shot.
[55:41.000 --> 55:51.000]  And two billion, big B, two billion serious adverse reactions of the type I described.
[55:51.000 --> 55:56.000]  Now these numbers are beyond staggering.
[55:56.000 --> 56:01.000]  They took to contrast that with history.
[56:01.000 --> 56:14.000]  Vaccines have typically been pulled from the market when the last one, the birth vaccine was pulled with only 35, 35 deaths.
[56:14.000 --> 56:19.000]  I hope people can appreciate the scale of what is going on here.
[56:19.000 --> 56:24.000]  An unimaginable carnage which isn't over.
[56:24.000 --> 56:29.000]  Because that number, first of all, is the current estimate.
[56:29.000 --> 56:37.000]  It does not include future deaths of a similar type, which will be cumulative on top of that.
[56:37.000 --> 56:40.000]  It does not include stillbirths.
[56:40.000 --> 56:53.000]  It does not include those avoidable deaths due to having had a one disease health care system for two and a half years with people not being treated or investigated for cancer or treated for cancer, for example.
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  Those numbers are not included.
[56:55.000 --> 57:01.000]  The numbers from the lockdowns, the suicides are not included.
[57:01.000 --> 57:17.000]  And also not included are the future deaths that we're anticipating from a rapid increase in the rate of cancer presentations and fatal infections because of immune suppression induced by the clout shot.
[57:17.000 --> 57:25.000]  Those factors are in addition to those jaw dropping numbers that I just mentioned.
[57:48.000 --> 57:51.000]  I don't promote things unless they really work.
[57:51.000 --> 57:58.000]  When it comes to politics or culture, economics, we are always the cutting edge, the tip of the spear.
[57:58.000 --> 58:02.000]  And when we talk about the products in infomercial.com, they all blow you away.
[58:02.000 --> 58:06.000]  If you'll just take them, if you'll just try them, I know you'll be, we'll be customers.

[59:14.000 --> 59:16.000]  I lead an incredibly stressful life.
[59:16.000 --> 59:25.000]  I don't play with Mr. Health, but if I wasn't taking products like X3 from infowarstore.com, I could not continue to do what I'm doing today.

[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  Yeah, there's evil in the universe.
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  There's also good.
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  And I do my best every day to be that good.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  To have the courage and the will to throw myself against the enemy.
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  But I can't do this without you.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  That's why.
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  I want to thank you for equipping me to get the arena with these people so that I can
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  die on my feet instead of be a slave on my knees because we will end up living on our
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  feet and dying on our knees.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  I'm going to air a few clips here because some stations don't care this segment.
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  I want to come back at the rest of the entire vaccine poison cover up coming unraveled.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:10.000]  It's just so incredible.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  We should be shooting our fireworks right now, but the criminals aren't died yet.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  We'll be right back when you take your calls.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  Got a bunch of big guests and huge news on weather control and more of the hurricane.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  Ian, it's all coming up.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  It's called the great reset.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  Tough guy.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  It's called the new world order.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  It's called the big banks wanting to squeeze the economy and make people poor so they can
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  loan us fiat money to take control of our lives with a social credit score and the universal basic income.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  That's everything.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  That's the whole future of our lives.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  The whole world is going to be about surveillance and control and then manipulating and tracking
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  everything you do.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  It's all being officially announced.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  We've got articles everywhere.
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  Their press releases saying.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  And the crew asked me during the break they go, are you all right?
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  Are you feeling okay?
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  They're going to starve a couple hundred million people to death.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  Yeah, I'm pretty freaked out.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  Yeah, this is real.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  This is not a freaking game to me, man.
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  You understand.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  I love you.
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:16.000]  I love you too.
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  I love you too.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  I love you too.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  I love you too.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  I love you too.
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  I love you too.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  I love you too.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  I love you too.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  I love you too.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  I love you too.
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  I love you too.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  I love you too.
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  I love you too.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  I love you too.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  I love you too.
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  I love you too.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  I love you too.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  Plug it.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  Yeah.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  pharmacy all fullling of your nausea.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  Yeah.
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  I love ya.
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  I like you.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  I like this.
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  You know, since we're here in California today, I've been having aived the dumping
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  and Development and this is all happening because that's all going on here.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:55.440]  Last night, I was like, what's wrong with you?
[1:02:55.440 --> 1:02:56.720]  You're really freaked out.
[1:02:56.720 --> 1:02:58.680]  I'm like, yeah, I'm really freaked out.
[1:02:58.680 --> 1:03:00.520]  I'm really freaked out.
[1:03:00.520 --> 1:03:03.640]  I'm really freaked out, you see, because this is real.
[1:03:03.640 --> 1:03:05.280]  The supply chain being cut off,
[1:03:05.280 --> 1:03:07.480]  the energy grid being cut off, is real.
[1:03:10.360 --> 1:03:12.000]  And we're going into a time now
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:13.800]  where we're not gonna be on the air.
[1:03:13.800 --> 1:03:15.360]  I mean, if we don't back this off,
[1:03:15.360 --> 1:03:18.200]  if we don't get sane people to stop the globalists,
[1:03:18.200 --> 1:03:20.840]  I mean, we won't be here in six months.
[1:03:20.840 --> 1:03:24.600]  You won't be here in six months.
[1:03:24.600 --> 1:03:25.600]  Boom, boom.
[1:03:31.600 --> 1:03:34.760]  Who is the most banned news network in the world?
[1:03:34.760 --> 1:03:36.040]  Infowars.com.
[1:03:36.040 --> 1:03:37.280]  Infowars comes to mind.
[1:03:37.280 --> 1:03:38.720]  Infowars.com.
[1:03:38.720 --> 1:03:39.600]  Infowars.
[1:03:39.600 --> 1:03:40.720]  You watch Infowars?
[1:03:40.720 --> 1:03:41.840]  Infowars.
[1:03:41.840 --> 1:03:44.040]  It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[1:03:44.040 --> 1:03:44.720]  Alex Jones.
[1:03:44.720 --> 1:03:45.320]  Nice guy.
[1:03:45.320 --> 1:03:47.960]  You must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[1:03:47.960 --> 1:03:48.760]  Alex Jones.
[1:03:48.760 --> 1:03:49.360]  Alex Jones.
[1:03:49.360 --> 1:03:50.240]  Alex Jones.
[1:03:50.240 --> 1:03:51.800]  Alex Jones is the greatest.
[1:03:51.800 --> 1:03:52.960]  He knows who Infowars is.
[1:03:52.960 --> 1:03:54.320]  Well, let's play on this joke over here.
[1:03:54.320 --> 1:03:55.800]  That's why the D-Plot program didn't work.
[1:03:55.800 --> 1:03:59.240]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[1:03:59.240 --> 1:04:01.240]  You need to listen to Alex Jones.
[1:04:01.240 --> 1:04:22.240]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:04:22.240 --> 1:04:35.240]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:04:35.240 --> 1:04:59.240]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:04:59.240 --> 1:05:01.240]  It's our best seller.
[1:05:01.240 --> 1:05:03.240]  We first came out with it five years ago,
[1:05:03.240 --> 1:05:05.240]  a moderate seller.
[1:05:05.240 --> 1:05:07.240]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion
[1:05:07.240 --> 1:05:09.240]  and experienced the way it made them feel
[1:05:09.240 --> 1:05:11.240]  and how healthy it made them,
[1:05:11.240 --> 1:05:13.240]  it has become our number one overall best seller.
[1:05:13.240 --> 1:05:15.240]  And it's been sold out for a while,
[1:05:15.240 --> 1:05:17.240]  but it's finally back in stock.
[1:05:17.240 --> 1:05:19.240]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge
[1:05:19.240 --> 1:05:21.240]  your immune system,
[1:05:21.240 --> 1:05:23.240]  but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[1:05:23.240 --> 1:05:25.240]  It has all the minerals,
[1:05:25.240 --> 1:05:27.240]  all the key amino acids,
[1:05:27.240 --> 1:05:29.240]  all of the essential vitamins that you need to live
[1:05:29.240 --> 1:05:31.240]  and be healthy.
[1:05:31.240 --> 1:05:33.240]  It's not about these things you die.
[1:05:33.240 --> 1:05:35.240]  And so much of the food is debased.
[1:05:35.240 --> 1:05:37.240]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[1:05:37.240 --> 1:05:39.240]  It is critical to bolster our body's defenses
[1:05:39.240 --> 1:05:41.240]  with a product like this.
[1:05:41.240 --> 1:05:43.240]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there.
[1:05:43.240 --> 1:05:45.240]  But this is amongst the very best
[1:05:45.240 --> 1:05:47.240]  and it's a low price and it funds the InfoWare.
[1:05:47.240 --> 1:05:49.240]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today,
[1:05:49.240 --> 1:05:51.240]  getting vitamin mineral fusion
[1:05:51.240 --> 1:05:53.240]  finally back in stock
[1:05:53.240 --> 1:05:55.240]  at InfoWareStore.com for 50% off.
[1:05:55.240 --> 1:05:57.240]  Vitamin mineral fusion back in stock
[1:05:57.240 --> 1:06:01.240]  at InfoWareStore.com
[1:06:19.240 --> 1:06:21.240]  I want listeners to know this
[1:06:21.240 --> 1:06:23.240]  as we enter the second hour today.
[1:06:23.240 --> 1:06:25.240]  We're going live until midnight tonight.
[1:06:25.240 --> 1:06:27.240]  We ask you to be part of the victory.
[1:06:27.240 --> 1:06:29.240]  Share the links at InfoWareStore.com
[1:06:29.240 --> 1:06:31.240]  that I do not come to you
[1:06:31.240 --> 1:06:33.240]  with positive news
[1:06:33.240 --> 1:06:35.240]  just to jack you up
[1:06:35.240 --> 1:06:37.240]  and tell you we're winning.
[1:06:37.240 --> 1:06:39.240]  I've been on there 28 years.
[1:06:39.240 --> 1:06:41.240]  People know when we're down
[1:06:41.240 --> 1:06:43.240]  and we're losing, I will tell you.
[1:06:43.240 --> 1:06:45.240]  You don't need me to tell you, you can see it too.
[1:06:45.240 --> 1:06:47.240]  But let me just tell you,
[1:06:47.240 --> 1:06:49.240]  and I'm getting chills right now,
[1:06:49.240 --> 1:06:51.240]  we are running the tables
[1:06:51.240 --> 1:06:53.240]  on the enemies of humanity.
[1:06:53.240 --> 1:06:55.240]  And it's totally right. Here's the problem.
[1:06:55.240 --> 1:06:57.240]  And you know what I'm about to say.
[1:06:57.240 --> 1:06:59.240]  It's got massive chills again.
[1:06:59.240 --> 1:07:01.240]  Before I tell you,
[1:07:01.240 --> 1:07:03.240]  Satan and his minions
[1:07:03.240 --> 1:07:05.240]  are going to throw everything they've got at us.
[1:07:05.240 --> 1:07:07.240]  Big time.
[1:07:07.240 --> 1:07:09.240]  But if you just joined us,
[1:07:09.240 --> 1:07:11.240]  the wheels are coming off.
[1:07:11.240 --> 1:07:13.240]  They lied and said the vaccine will protect you.
[1:07:13.240 --> 1:07:15.240]  It wouldn't. They're criminals.
[1:07:15.240 --> 1:07:17.240]  They knew what they were doing as part of a larger plan
[1:07:17.240 --> 1:07:19.240]  to wire us up for nanotech
[1:07:19.240 --> 1:07:21.240]  and to be manipulated by electromagnetic energy.
[1:07:21.240 --> 1:07:23.240]  All the patents are there. It's all coming out.
[1:07:23.240 --> 1:07:25.240]  But they just had huge hearings
[1:07:25.240 --> 1:07:27.240]  that are ongoing this week in the European Union Parliament.
[1:07:27.240 --> 1:07:29.240]  And they are annihilating them.
[1:07:29.240 --> 1:07:31.240]  So let's go
[1:07:31.240 --> 1:07:33.240]  to some of these clips.
[1:07:33.240 --> 1:07:35.240]  This is
[1:07:35.240 --> 1:07:37.240]  absolute fire
[1:07:37.240 --> 1:07:39.240]  from a member of the European Union Parliament.
[1:07:39.240 --> 1:07:41.240]  Christine
[1:07:41.240 --> 1:07:43.240]  Terrace.
[1:07:43.240 --> 1:07:45.240]  Several clips of her.
[1:07:45.240 --> 1:07:47.240]  Then we're going to also play
[1:07:47.240 --> 1:07:49.240]  some other clips.
[1:07:49.240 --> 1:07:51.240]  From
[1:07:51.240 --> 1:07:53.240]  Christine Anderson
[1:07:53.240 --> 1:07:55.240]  about what's happening as it comes out
[1:07:55.240 --> 1:07:57.240]  that they premeditatedly lied and committed mass murder.
[1:07:57.240 --> 1:07:59.240]  And the politicians that took the money
[1:07:59.240 --> 1:08:01.240]  and went along with it, they're guilty as well.
[1:08:01.240 --> 1:08:03.240]  I love this new meme going out
[1:08:03.240 --> 1:08:05.240]  on Twitter.
[1:08:05.240 --> 1:08:07.240]  For TV viewers, you can see it. It's from James Rooney.
[1:08:07.240 --> 1:08:09.240]  How quickly does the
[1:08:09.240 --> 1:08:11.240]  speed of science get you here?
[1:08:11.240 --> 1:08:13.240]  Because that's what they said. Yeah, the speed of science is
[1:08:13.240 --> 1:08:15.240]  we don't ask questions.
[1:08:15.240 --> 1:08:17.240]  We put in you what we want.
[1:08:17.240 --> 1:08:19.240]  We want to get you to Nuremberg 2.0.
[1:08:19.240 --> 1:08:21.240]  So here's the clips back to back.
[1:08:21.240 --> 1:08:23.240]  Yesterday
[1:08:23.240 --> 1:08:25.240]  when one of my colleagues asked if they
[1:08:25.240 --> 1:08:27.240]  tested, in this case, Pfizer,
[1:08:27.240 --> 1:08:29.240]  if Pfizer tested
[1:08:29.240 --> 1:08:31.240]  if their medical product
[1:08:31.240 --> 1:08:33.240]  it's stopping
[1:08:33.240 --> 1:08:35.240]  the spread of the virus,
[1:08:35.240 --> 1:08:37.240]  we were shocked
[1:08:37.240 --> 1:08:39.240]  to find out yesterday
[1:08:39.240 --> 1:08:41.240]  that I haven't tested
[1:08:41.240 --> 1:08:43.240]  their vaccine
[1:08:43.240 --> 1:08:45.240]  to see if it's
[1:08:45.240 --> 1:08:47.240]  stopping the spread of the virus.
[1:08:47.240 --> 1:08:49.240]  So,
[1:08:49.240 --> 1:08:51.240]  we are now more than a year after the Green
[1:08:51.240 --> 1:08:53.240]  Certificate, the Digital Green Certificate
[1:08:53.240 --> 1:08:55.240]  was imposed in the European Union
[1:08:55.240 --> 1:08:57.240]  and people were forced
[1:08:57.240 --> 1:08:59.240]  to be vaccinated with the medical
[1:08:59.240 --> 1:09:01.240]  product in order to exercise
[1:09:01.240 --> 1:09:03.240]  their basic fundamental rights
[1:09:03.240 --> 1:09:05.240]  and we were told
[1:09:05.240 --> 1:09:07.240]  we were voted against the Green Certificate
[1:09:07.240 --> 1:09:09.240]  but many of our colleagues
[1:09:09.240 --> 1:09:11.240]  voted in favor of it
[1:09:11.240 --> 1:09:13.240]  because they believed what these companies
[1:09:13.240 --> 1:09:15.240]  have said
[1:09:15.240 --> 1:09:17.240]  that if you get vaccinated
[1:09:17.240 --> 1:09:19.240]  you will not be infected
[1:09:19.240 --> 1:09:21.240]  and you will not spread the virus.
[1:09:21.240 --> 1:09:23.240]  They even ran campaign and said
[1:09:23.240 --> 1:09:25.240]  get vaccinated in order to keep
[1:09:25.240 --> 1:09:27.240]  your grandmother and your parents healthy
[1:09:27.240 --> 1:09:29.240]  and we find out now
[1:09:29.240 --> 1:09:31.240]  after more than a year
[1:09:31.240 --> 1:09:33.240]  that when they requested
[1:09:33.240 --> 1:09:35.240]  the special marketing
[1:09:35.240 --> 1:09:37.240]  authorization
[1:09:37.240 --> 1:09:39.240]  they haven't tested the vaccine
[1:09:39.240 --> 1:09:41.240]  to see if it's
[1:09:41.240 --> 1:09:43.240]  stopping the spread of the virus.
[1:09:43.240 --> 1:09:45.240]  So, I'm asking again
[1:09:45.240 --> 1:09:47.240]  and we are asking again
[1:09:47.240 --> 1:09:49.240]  what are they going to hide?
[1:09:49.240 --> 1:09:51.240]  What do they hide exactly?
[1:09:51.240 --> 1:09:53.240]  Why aren't they transparent?
[1:09:53.240 --> 1:09:55.240]  With their medical product
[1:09:55.240 --> 1:09:57.240]  we heard yesterday, I mean it was
[1:09:57.240 --> 1:09:59.240]  I was shocked
[1:09:59.240 --> 1:10:01.240]  because Pfizer used this opportunity
[1:10:01.240 --> 1:10:03.240]  just to do a PR campaign
[1:10:03.240 --> 1:10:05.240]  and even
[1:10:05.240 --> 1:10:07.240]  lecture us why are we asking this
[1:10:07.240 --> 1:10:09.240]  I'm not asking that, who are they to question us
[1:10:09.240 --> 1:10:11.240]  what kind of questions do we ask?
[1:10:11.240 --> 1:10:13.240]  We are elected
[1:10:13.240 --> 1:10:15.240]  by the people for the people, not they
[1:10:15.240 --> 1:10:17.240]  and they are supposed
[1:10:17.240 --> 1:10:19.240]  to answer all these questions
[1:10:19.240 --> 1:10:21.240]  which they have not.
[1:10:21.240 --> 1:10:23.240]  I cannot hide my shock
[1:10:23.240 --> 1:10:25.240]  and
[1:10:25.240 --> 1:10:27.240]  nobody answered
[1:10:27.240 --> 1:10:29.240]  concrete questions
[1:10:29.240 --> 1:10:31.240]  that all of my colleagues asked
[1:10:31.240 --> 1:10:33.240]  we heard allegations here
[1:10:33.240 --> 1:10:35.240]  and statements
[1:10:35.240 --> 1:10:37.240]  from the representative of Pfizer
[1:10:37.240 --> 1:10:39.240]  stating and I quote
[1:10:39.240 --> 1:10:41.240]  that they cannot release the contracts
[1:10:41.240 --> 1:10:43.240]  because they have certain interests
[1:10:43.240 --> 1:10:45.240]  what about the interests of the people
[1:10:45.240 --> 1:10:47.240]  what about their health
[1:10:47.240 --> 1:10:49.240]  because it's our authority
[1:10:49.240 --> 1:10:51.240]  and our job to make sure
[1:10:51.240 --> 1:10:53.240]  that we get to the bottom of this
[1:10:53.240 --> 1:10:55.240]  so the first question that I address to you
[1:10:55.240 --> 1:10:57.240]  is the following
[1:10:57.240 --> 1:10:59.240]  just yesterday
[1:10:59.240 --> 1:11:01.240]  when exactly are you going to
[1:11:01.240 --> 1:11:03.240]  fully publish
[1:11:03.240 --> 1:11:05.240]  the contracts that you signed
[1:11:05.240 --> 1:11:07.240]  with the representative of Pfizer
[1:11:07.240 --> 1:11:09.240]  and the European Commission
[1:11:09.240 --> 1:11:11.240]  I cannot hide my shock
[1:11:11.240 --> 1:11:13.240]  and
[1:11:13.240 --> 1:11:15.240]  nobody answered
[1:11:15.240 --> 1:11:17.240]  concrete questions
[1:11:17.240 --> 1:11:19.240]  that all of my colleagues asked
[1:11:19.240 --> 1:11:21.240]  we heard allegations here
[1:11:21.240 --> 1:11:23.240]  and statements
[1:11:23.240 --> 1:11:25.240]  from the representative of Pfizer
[1:11:25.240 --> 1:11:27.240]  stating and I quote
[1:11:27.240 --> 1:11:29.240]  that they cannot release the contracts
[1:11:29.240 --> 1:11:31.240]  because they have certain interests
[1:11:31.240 --> 1:11:33.240]  what about the interests of the people
[1:11:33.240 --> 1:11:35.240]  because it's our authority
[1:11:35.240 --> 1:11:37.240]  and our job to make sure
[1:11:37.240 --> 1:11:39.240]  that we get to the bottom of this
[1:11:39.240 --> 1:11:41.240]  so the first question that I address to you
[1:11:41.240 --> 1:11:43.240]  is the following
[1:11:43.240 --> 1:11:45.240]  just yesterday
[1:11:45.240 --> 1:11:47.240]  when exactly are you going to
[1:11:47.240 --> 1:11:49.240]  fully publish
[1:11:49.240 --> 1:11:51.240]  the contracts that you signed
[1:11:51.240 --> 1:11:53.240]  between Pfizer and the European Commission
[1:11:53.240 --> 1:11:55.240]  the fact that Mr. Borla, CEO of Pfizer
[1:11:55.240 --> 1:11:57.240]  had the audacity to refuse
[1:11:57.240 --> 1:11:59.240]  to appear in front of this committee
[1:11:59.240 --> 1:12:01.240]  to answer questions constitutes
[1:12:01.240 --> 1:12:03.240]  for the people whose tax
[1:12:03.240 --> 1:12:05.240]  money he took by the way
[1:12:05.240 --> 1:12:07.240]  if we cannot compel a crucial player
[1:12:07.240 --> 1:12:09.240]  to appear in front of this committee
[1:12:09.240 --> 1:12:11.240]  then this committee is
[1:12:11.240 --> 1:12:13.240]  useless so I propose
[1:12:13.240 --> 1:12:15.240]  that we declare ourselves incompetent
[1:12:15.240 --> 1:12:17.240]  and I furthermore propose
[1:12:17.240 --> 1:12:19.240]  that this committee concludes
[1:12:19.240 --> 1:12:21.240]  the need for a committee
[1:12:21.240 --> 1:12:23.240]  of inquiry
[1:12:23.240 --> 1:12:25.240]  alright so the criminal investigations are off
[1:12:25.240 --> 1:12:27.240]  ladies and gentlemen
[1:12:27.240 --> 1:12:29.240]  here is a short compilation
[1:12:29.240 --> 1:12:31.240]  of the dramatic evolution of Pfizer
[1:12:31.240 --> 1:12:33.240]  CEO's position on whether the vaccine
[1:12:33.240 --> 1:12:35.240]  stops transmission
[1:12:35.240 --> 1:12:37.240]  what are the indications right now
[1:12:37.240 --> 1:12:39.240]  that are telling us that there is
[1:12:39.240 --> 1:12:41.240]  a protection against
[1:12:41.240 --> 1:12:43.240]  transmission of the disease
[1:12:43.240 --> 1:12:45.240]  there is no variant that we have identified
[1:12:45.240 --> 1:12:47.240]  that escapes the protection of our vaccine
[1:12:47.240 --> 1:12:49.240]  against Covid to come now with a treatment
[1:12:49.240 --> 1:12:51.240]  of 90% effectiveness
[1:12:51.240 --> 1:12:53.240]  personally makes me very proud
[1:12:53.240 --> 1:12:55.240]  about it
[1:12:55.240 --> 1:12:57.240]  and we know that the two dose of the vaccine
[1:12:57.240 --> 1:12:59.240]  are very limited protection if any
[1:12:59.240 --> 1:13:01.240]  the three dose is with a booster
[1:13:01.240 --> 1:13:03.240]  they offer reasonable protection
[1:13:03.240 --> 1:13:05.240]  against it is
[1:13:05.240 --> 1:13:07.240]  necessary a fourth boost
[1:13:07.240 --> 1:13:09.240]  right now the protection
[1:13:09.240 --> 1:13:11.240]  what you are getting from the third
[1:13:11.240 --> 1:13:13.240]  it is good enough
[1:13:13.240 --> 1:13:15.240]  actually quite good for hospitalizations
[1:13:15.240 --> 1:13:17.240]  and deaths it's not that good against
[1:13:17.240 --> 1:13:19.240]  infections but doesn't last
[1:13:19.240 --> 1:13:21.240]  now we're gonna
[1:13:21.240 --> 1:13:23.240]  get more of these clips throughout the day
[1:13:23.240 --> 1:13:25.240]  we're going live until midnight tonight
[1:13:25.240 --> 1:13:27.240]  I forgot to tell you guys
[1:13:27.240 --> 1:13:29.240]  he was on CBS and NBC
[1:13:29.240 --> 1:13:31.240]  the clips I remember two years ago
[1:13:31.240 --> 1:13:33.240]  before they rolled out the poison shots
[1:13:33.240 --> 1:13:35.240]  master criminals like Bill Gates
[1:13:35.240 --> 1:13:37.240]  want to tell you up front how they're going to rape you and kill you
[1:13:37.240 --> 1:13:39.240]  so he went on TV
[1:13:39.240 --> 1:13:41.240]  and he said well we know
[1:13:41.240 --> 1:13:43.240]  the first shot is not going to work and the second
[1:13:43.240 --> 1:13:45.240]  really won't it will take
[1:13:45.240 --> 1:13:47.240]  three or four shots and you'll probably need
[1:13:47.240 --> 1:13:49.240]  a few shots a year that was the
[1:13:49.240 --> 1:13:51.240]  business model and we told you folks it's not
[1:13:51.240 --> 1:13:53.240]  going to work it's going to erase your immune system
[1:13:53.240 --> 1:13:55.240]  because in their own documents they were admitting it
[1:13:55.240 --> 1:13:57.240]  it was a business plan and they've erased
[1:13:57.240 --> 1:13:59.240]  the immune systems of these people that took it
[1:13:59.240 --> 1:14:01.240]  the numbers are out in big studies
[1:14:01.240 --> 1:14:03.240]  all over Europe all over the US
[1:14:03.240 --> 1:14:05.240]  young people that took the shots
[1:14:05.240 --> 1:14:07.240]  suddenly are super sick and the hospitals are saying
[1:14:07.240 --> 1:14:09.240]  they have no immune system
[1:14:09.240 --> 1:14:11.240]  it's like they have AIDS
[1:14:11.240 --> 1:14:13.240]  but they don't test positive
[1:14:13.240 --> 1:14:15.240]  they have vades
[1:14:15.240 --> 1:14:17.240]  vaccine induced auto
[1:14:17.240 --> 1:14:19.240]  immune deficiency syndrome
[1:14:19.240 --> 1:14:21.240]  and isn't it funny
[1:14:21.240 --> 1:14:23.240]  that in Australia they had to pull their main vaccine
[1:14:23.240 --> 1:14:25.240]  because it was giving false positives
[1:14:25.240 --> 1:14:27.240]  for HIV because
[1:14:27.240 --> 1:14:29.240]  the spike protein is from
[1:14:29.240 --> 1:14:31.240]  the HIV virus
[1:14:31.240 --> 1:14:33.240]  that Fauci cooked up in the
[1:14:33.240 --> 1:14:35.240]  19 late 70s
[1:14:35.240 --> 1:14:37.240]  and rolled out in the 80s
[1:14:37.240 --> 1:14:39.240]  oh they've done this before
[1:14:39.240 --> 1:14:41.240]  and HIV was their beta test
[1:14:41.240 --> 1:14:43.240]  now they've given you
[1:14:43.240 --> 1:14:45.240]  COVID and God knows what the next
[1:14:45.240 --> 1:14:47.240]  parts of it are because the side effects
[1:14:47.240 --> 1:14:49.240]  are 20 million dead
[1:14:49.240 --> 1:14:51.240]  they got a long term goal
[1:14:51.240 --> 1:14:53.240]  to kill you slow it was a little too strong though
[1:14:53.240 --> 1:14:55.240]  a little too obvious
[1:14:55.240 --> 1:14:57.240]  what they did so I've got all this other news
[1:14:57.240 --> 1:14:59.240]  and all this other stuff to cover
[1:14:59.240 --> 1:15:01.240]  massive nuclear war news

[1:15:43.240 --> 1:15:45.240]  they're counting on you not taking action
[1:15:45.240 --> 1:15:47.240]  you saw those members of parliament
[1:15:47.240 --> 1:15:49.240]  in the EU saying share this link
[1:15:49.240 --> 1:15:51.240]  we're in a war we're in an info war

[1:16:33.240 --> 1:16:35.240]  is debased there's so many chemicals
[1:16:35.240 --> 1:16:37.240]  in the environment it is critical

[1:18:13.240 --> 1:18:15.240]  is cited by Joe Rogan
[1:18:15.240 --> 1:18:17.240]  and Tucker Carlson
[1:18:17.240 --> 1:18:19.240]  Oro and other foreign leaders
[1:18:19.240 --> 1:18:21.240]  like Nigel Farage
[1:18:21.240 --> 1:18:23.240]  as being the main impetus
[1:18:23.240 --> 1:18:25.240]  towards firing up
[1:18:25.240 --> 1:18:27.240]  their main base to defeat the new world order
[1:18:27.240 --> 1:18:29.240]  the only reason

[1:21:02.240 --> 1:21:04.240]  an expert on Russia and more
[1:21:04.240 --> 1:21:06.240]  that will have as a surprise for you
[1:21:06.240 --> 1:21:08.240]  when they join us
[1:21:08.240 --> 1:21:10.240]  again, thank you
[1:21:10.240 --> 1:21:12.240]  for tuning in today
[1:21:12.240 --> 1:21:14.240]  I really appreciate you
[1:21:14.240 --> 1:21:16.240]  as you can see we've not been playing games the last 28 years
[1:21:16.240 --> 1:21:18.240]  we know what we're talking about
[1:21:18.240 --> 1:21:20.240]  and we can stop these people
[1:21:20.240 --> 1:21:22.240]  but we've got to get serious and we've got to have courage
[1:21:22.240 --> 1:21:24.240]  again I didn't want to call for the arrest
[1:21:24.240 --> 1:21:26.240]  and conviction
[1:21:26.240 --> 1:21:28.240]  and execution of the globalist last hour
[1:21:28.240 --> 1:21:33.120]  They flip a little switch and send folks to kill you or put you in prison, but I've just got to do it as a man
[1:21:33.480 --> 1:21:34.920]  It's what they deserve
[1:21:34.920 --> 1:21:40.760]  But nobody should shoot them nobody should bomb them nobody should we should take our governments back by exposing them in the info war
[1:21:40.760 --> 1:21:47.520]  But they need to know that in the end there'll be Nuremberg to and they will hang on international television
[1:21:47.760 --> 1:21:50.720]  All right, and I stand by that they want to kill us
[1:21:50.840 --> 1:21:57.180]  Well, the children don't deserve to be forcibly injected with stuff that erases your immune system and get some heart attacks and God's watching
[1:21:57.180 --> 1:22:02.040]  And if I don't call for that God doesn't like me. That's my boss
[1:22:02.440 --> 1:22:06.880]  God's pleased with me right now. I can feel it and I'm given more discernment
[1:22:06.880 --> 1:22:12.440]  I'm given more closest to God the more I do the right thing and you dumb-ass Satanist don't get that
[1:22:12.920 --> 1:22:19.840]  When you follow natural law and you get behind God's directives through free will the universe is yours. I
[1:22:19.840 --> 1:22:28.760]  Will not aid in a bat mass murderers when I know what they're doing and going 50% against them is cowardly going 90%
[1:22:28.760 --> 1:22:33.800]  Against them is cowardly. God wants 100 total percent
[1:22:34.520 --> 1:22:36.520]  resistance
[1:22:37.240 --> 1:22:39.240]  period
[1:22:44.680 --> 1:22:46.680]  100
[1:22:46.680 --> 1:22:53.960]  Total commitment percent that's what God wants and all you're missing out on is infinity by not doing
[1:22:55.480 --> 1:23:01.040]  It's like winning the lottery times a trillion you want to fight evil you want to stand up
[1:23:01.040 --> 1:23:08.480]  You want to step into who you are then all the secrets that are in your genetics that activate and connect to your soul and
[1:23:08.600 --> 1:23:12.200]  The real control panel of the universe will be given to you
[1:23:12.200 --> 1:23:17.200]  And then you'll throw down your crowns like revelation says when God gives us the crowns
[1:23:17.480 --> 1:23:21.880]  Which is the symbol of of enlightenment. We will throw them at God's feet saying
[1:23:23.280 --> 1:23:25.960]  We do not want credit. We just want to be in your presence
[1:23:26.840 --> 1:23:29.920]  because the presence being in the presence of the Almighty is
[1:23:34.840 --> 1:23:36.520]  Unspeakable
[1:23:36.520 --> 1:23:38.360]  infinity better
[1:23:38.360 --> 1:23:44.360]  Then watching a beautiful sunset or the best orgasm or when you're in a fight and the bully starts it
[1:23:44.360 --> 1:23:46.560]  And you knock them down and they hit the ground you feel that feeling of exhilaration
[1:23:47.400 --> 1:23:49.040]  imagine something
[1:23:49.040 --> 1:23:51.040]  trillions of times better
[1:23:51.200 --> 1:23:53.000]  unspeakably better
[1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:56.680]  Then your greatest victories then your greatest exhilarations
[1:23:56.680 --> 1:24:05.400]  It's it's so incredible that your mouth's hanging open because it's it's it's over. You're done. You're with God and
[1:24:08.160 --> 1:24:11.360]  You don't understand why doesn't everybody want this
[1:24:15.440 --> 1:24:17.440]  And that's the big mystery isn't it?
[1:24:17.440 --> 1:24:25.560]  Because God doesn't just give you that enlightenment and that connection to infinity easily
[1:24:27.960 --> 1:24:29.960]  It's like the cheesy Empire strikes back
[1:24:31.440 --> 1:24:34.440]  Where Luke Skywalker asked Yoda is the dark side stronger?
[1:24:36.440 --> 1:24:39.440]  Yoda says no quicker
[1:24:40.440 --> 1:24:41.440]  Easier
[1:24:42.440 --> 1:24:44.440]  More seductive
[1:24:44.440 --> 1:24:47.440]  But it's not powerful at all
[1:24:48.440 --> 1:24:50.440]  There'll be one Kenobi says Darth Vader
[1:24:54.440 --> 1:24:56.440]  Says the circle is now complete
[1:24:57.440 --> 1:25:01.440]  When I left you I was but the learner now I am the master
[1:25:04.440 --> 1:25:07.440]  And Obi-Wan Kenobi says only a master of evil Darth
[1:25:09.440 --> 1:25:11.440]  If you strike me down
[1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:13.440]  If you strike me down
[1:25:13.440 --> 1:25:16.440]  I shall become more powerful than you can
[1:25:17.440 --> 1:25:19.440]  Possibly imagine
[1:25:25.440 --> 1:25:27.440]  So I don't have a death wish ladies and gentlemen
[1:25:27.440 --> 1:25:29.440]  I don't want to go to prison. I don't want to be killed
[1:25:29.440 --> 1:25:35.440]  I want to be here for my wife and my family and my children and you but it's no choice at all
[1:25:35.440 --> 1:25:42.440]  That I will never sell out. It's not possible
[1:25:45.440 --> 1:25:48.440]  Because I have been shown infinity
[1:25:52.440 --> 1:25:56.440]  About a year ago and I've been praying
[1:25:56.440 --> 1:26:03.440]  And I was saying to God I'm weak and please just give me the strength to be strong
[1:26:04.440 --> 1:26:07.440]  I said I know you're a free will God but you just take me over
[1:26:08.440 --> 1:26:11.440]  You just turn me into a machine. I just I don't want to feel anything
[1:26:12.440 --> 1:26:14.440]  And I went to bed that night
[1:26:16.440 --> 1:26:18.440]  And it was like a hundred lifetimes
[1:26:19.440 --> 1:26:21.440]  I was taken away
[1:26:21.440 --> 1:26:30.440]  And up there is the best way to describe it up there the correction doesn't matter but there it was just like
[1:26:32.440 --> 1:26:34.440]  This is what we're doing. This is what's going to happen
[1:26:35.440 --> 1:26:37.440]  But you've got to make the choice
[1:26:38.440 --> 1:26:42.440]  And I said but I want to know the New World Order. I want to know why they do it and God said you don't want to know
[1:26:43.440 --> 1:26:45.440]  But here would you like to look
[1:26:45.440 --> 1:26:49.440]  And I spent lifetimes
[1:26:52.440 --> 1:26:59.440]  Digging through other civilizations and our own and just seeing the mind of the enemy and how pathetic it was
[1:27:00.440 --> 1:27:06.440]  And it was always old men in these tombs just playing with sand through their hands and
[1:27:06.440 --> 1:27:14.440]  Groping and trying to control populations and people when they never had a chance to do it. It was just it was so so powerful
[1:27:16.440 --> 1:27:24.440]  That I came back out of that those tombs of civilizations and free worlds and all the people that sold out to Satan and I said
[1:27:26.440 --> 1:27:29.440]  I feel total absolution. I want to stay here
[1:27:31.440 --> 1:27:33.440]  And it was no
[1:27:33.440 --> 1:27:35.440]  That's not what's gonna happen
[1:27:40.440 --> 1:27:44.440]  But just know this is waiting and just like that
[1:27:46.440 --> 1:27:52.440]  Going into that time continuum went in reverse through the portal out and back into my body
[1:27:52.440 --> 1:28:00.440]  And I woke up and just I was just like it was nothing is even as scrabble and I remember praying again and again
[1:28:01.440 --> 1:28:04.440]  Please let me see that again. Please take me back again
[1:28:09.440 --> 1:28:14.440]  And the message was no instead of that let's show you what's going on other places
[1:28:14.440 --> 1:28:20.440]  So that you're willing to fight for consciousness and free will in the multiverse
[1:28:21.440 --> 1:28:23.440]  And let's just show you the other side
[1:28:25.440 --> 1:28:27.440]  And then I've been shown
[1:28:29.440 --> 1:28:31.440]  The postgame film reels
[1:28:33.440 --> 1:28:39.440]  Of not just what's happened in other places, but what's gonna happen here and let me tell you it ain't pretty

[1:31:58.440 --> 1:32:02.440]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the Globals
[1:32:02.440 --> 1:32:09.440]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics not just in America but in the world
[1:32:10.440 --> 1:32:14.440]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war
[1:32:15.440 --> 1:32:17.440]  But I don't deserve the credit. Yes, I've persevered
[1:32:18.440 --> 1:32:23.440]  But the listeners and viewers who support info wars are the real reason we've had the success
[1:32:24.440 --> 1:32:28.440]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order we've ever had
[1:32:28.440 --> 1:32:35.440]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today
[1:32:36.440 --> 1:32:42.440]  It's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify them
[1:32:43.440 --> 1:32:49.440]  God bless you all I salute you. I thank you and I beg you to intensify what you're doing now
[1:32:50.440 --> 1:32:52.440]  Because we are over the target and history is happening
[1:32:52.440 --> 1:32:57.440]  The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight. God bless you all
[1:32:59.440 --> 1:33:05.440]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's Alex Jones
[1:33:05.440 --> 1:33:12.440]  It was in March of this year that I was sitting at a table in a gilded hall with a very famous millionaire
[1:33:13.440 --> 1:33:18.440]  We were sitting around with all these professors and scientists and military experts
[1:33:19.440 --> 1:33:25.440]  Debating what would happen with Putin's war in the Ukraine or Soros' war, it should be called
[1:33:25.440 --> 1:33:32.440]  And about a three-hour dinner and I said the danger will be when Putin is defeated by NATO forces
[1:33:33.440 --> 1:33:40.440]  He's walked into a trap and then it will be the threat of nuclear war and they'll start cutting off the pipelines
[1:33:41.440 --> 1:33:43.440]  He used that as the pretext for the cover for the economic collapse
[1:33:44.440 --> 1:33:46.440]  They've already initiated what's going on with Putin
[1:33:46.440 --> 1:33:54.440]  And then it will be the threat of nuclear war and they'll start cutting off the pipelines and use that as the pretext for the cover for the economic collapse
[1:33:55.440 --> 1:33:57.440]  They've already initiated what the cover would turn a row up
[1:33:59.440 --> 1:34:03.440]  And one of the other well-known people that was there who I respect and I like
[1:34:04.440 --> 1:34:06.440]  Won't say his name
[1:34:07.440 --> 1:34:10.440]  He said Alex Putin's gonna win
[1:34:10.440 --> 1:34:15.440]  And I said nobody wins in nuclear war
[1:34:19.440 --> 1:34:24.440]  Now I don't tell you that story to hype myself up or anything, it's not that, it's that
[1:34:25.440 --> 1:34:27.440]  These are the real discussions that are going on
[1:34:31.440 --> 1:34:34.440]  And these are the things that we should take very seriously
[1:34:34.440 --> 1:34:38.440]  And in that same meeting and in other meetings I had subsequently
[1:34:40.440 --> 1:34:42.440]  With other Bilderberg attendees
[1:34:43.440 --> 1:34:47.440]  The discussion was should we evacuate, and I'm not with these people, but should we
[1:34:48.440 --> 1:34:50.440]  Evacuate the southern hemisphere and where best to go
[1:34:51.440 --> 1:34:53.440]  And now a lot of those people have gone to the southern hemisphere
[1:34:55.440 --> 1:34:58.440]  So let me just put that out there as where we are right now
[1:34:58.440 --> 1:35:05.440]  We're taking your calls, first-time callers on World War III, on the massive vaccine poison news coming out
[1:35:06.440 --> 1:35:10.440]  On anything you want to discuss, any topic, just be a first-time caller and have a clear telephone line
[1:35:11.440 --> 1:35:13.440]  And ready to make your point, I'd love to hear from you, that way we get to everybody
[1:35:13.440 --> 1:35:27.440]  877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, there it is, 877-789-2539
[1:35:28.440 --> 1:35:32.440]  But that's how serious this is, the end of the global currency being the dollar
[1:35:33.440 --> 1:35:36.440]  A new global currency, we're at the crossroads right now
[1:35:36.440 --> 1:35:44.440]  And if you study history, any crossroads has war as the main ingredient
[1:35:45.440 --> 1:35:54.440]  Now, if I just cared about my skin, I would be in the middle of Montana or Wyoming right now
[1:35:55.440 --> 1:35:57.440]  In a shack with my wife and children
[1:35:58.440 --> 1:36:01.440]  Most of my children are grown up now, and now I'm old
[1:36:01.440 --> 1:36:07.440]  It's crazy, three-year children are grown up, but my younger daughter's five
[1:36:08.440 --> 1:36:10.440]  Sweet little Veronica
[1:36:11.440 --> 1:36:16.440]  And I have a fleshly anger at myself every day that I haven't evacuated
[1:36:19.440 --> 1:36:23.440]  But I'm not going to wait in the Southern Hemisphere and hope this doesn't happen
[1:36:23.440 --> 1:36:25.440]  I'm not going to run off to Wyoming or Montana
[1:36:26.440 --> 1:36:29.440]  I'm going to stay at the helm and bet my daughter
[1:36:29.440 --> 1:36:33.440]  My daughter and my name and my children on this
[1:36:33.440 --> 1:36:35.440]  Because I think we can stop this together
[1:36:35.440 --> 1:36:38.440]  But if you don't realize how much danger we're in
[1:36:39.440 --> 1:36:47.440]  And if you don't internalize that and then externalize your prayer to God to stop this
[1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:54.440]  And your political, corporate, financial, historical, human action against it
[1:36:54.440 --> 1:36:59.440]  You are insane
[1:37:01.440 --> 1:37:05.440]  We've all been in God's presence, whether we like it or not, whether we admit it or not
[1:37:05.440 --> 1:37:08.440]  But I've really been in God's presence
[1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:12.440]  And I can tell you, I have absolution, I know it's real
[1:37:13.440 --> 1:37:17.440]  It gives me a great strength, but I still love my family and I still want to save the planet
[1:37:17.440 --> 1:37:21.440]  And God wants that too, God wants to test us and see what we'll do under stress
[1:37:21.440 --> 1:37:22.440]  What we'll do
[1:37:22.440 --> 1:37:23.440]  What we'll do
[1:37:23.440 --> 1:37:25.440]  This isn't a fake simulation in some computer
[1:37:25.440 --> 1:37:34.440]  This is real planet, real rocks, real trees, real fish, real birds, real people, real weapons, real decisions
[1:37:36.440 --> 1:37:40.440]  Yeah, big tech's got their metaverse, God's got the universe
[1:37:41.440 --> 1:37:42.440]  Hear that quote?
[1:37:42.440 --> 1:37:47.440]  Big tech's got their metaverse, God's got the multiverse
[1:37:47.440 --> 1:37:54.440]  Yeah, it's a big club, we ain't in it, good, we don't want to be in your satanic club
[1:37:58.440 --> 1:38:02.440]  Tove and Drew and Rick and Believer, your calls are coming up
[1:38:04.440 --> 1:38:09.440]  But let's hit some of these headlines here, as we see revelation fulfilled
[1:38:11.440 --> 1:38:12.440]  Almost like it's scripted
[1:38:14.440 --> 1:38:15.440]  Almost like it's a play
[1:38:15.440 --> 1:38:22.440]  Be ready for nuclear war if Russian army collapses
[1:38:24.440 --> 1:38:28.440]  That's what the head of the British military said, and that's exactly what I said in March
[1:38:29.440 --> 1:38:32.440]  In that room with a bunch of billionaires
[1:38:34.440 --> 1:38:36.440]  I said a billionaires, a bunch of billionaires
[1:38:39.440 --> 1:38:42.440]  And I was there because they know I've predicted the future, it's no hard to do
[1:38:42.440 --> 1:38:44.440]  And they said, what do you see happening?
[1:38:44.440 --> 1:38:48.440]  And I said, Putin's going to get his ass kicked, he walks into a trap, total NATO operation
[1:38:48.440 --> 1:38:50.440]  I know a bunch of people personally who were there
[1:38:52.440 --> 1:38:56.440]  The army is toe to toe with the Russians, we're at war with Russia
[1:38:57.440 --> 1:39:01.440]  And I said, Putin needs to be given an exit strategy and a peace deal now
[1:39:01.440 --> 1:39:04.440]  Let him have 10% of the country, this has got to stop
[1:39:04.440 --> 1:39:11.440]  NATO aggression has got to end, this is out of control
[1:39:13.440 --> 1:39:19.440]  And half the table laughed at me, they said, Putin's going to win, Putin's going to take all Ukraine by the end of the month
[1:39:19.440 --> 1:39:22.440]  And I said, you just watch, Putin's going to get his ass kicked
[1:39:23.440 --> 1:39:28.440]  He's up against 6th generation warfare, he's up against robot drones, all satellite directed
[1:39:28.440 --> 1:39:33.440]  They send out one Ukrainian with three drones on their back, switchblade drones and others
[1:39:33.440 --> 1:39:35.440]  Believe me, they're not showing you their best stuff
[1:39:35.440 --> 1:39:39.440]  It goes up, US satellite controls it, they tell the person where to go
[1:39:39.440 --> 1:39:43.440]  Satellites watching the Russian tank, or the Russian troop movement, or the Russian base
[1:39:44.440 --> 1:39:49.440]  They send in 5, 6 humans, they didn't get robots yet to deliver it
[1:39:50.440 --> 1:39:54.440]  They launch robot drones, they strike the targets, Russians can't beat that
[1:39:54.440 --> 1:39:57.440]  The Russians will lose
[1:39:59.440 --> 1:40:01.440]  And then, what are they going to do?
[1:40:02.440 --> 1:40:07.440]  I gave him the same briefing I gave these globalists just 6 months ago
[1:40:08.440 --> 1:40:14.440]  What are they going to do when Russia gets his ass kicked?
[1:40:15.440 --> 1:40:19.440]  The Russian hardliners that run the country are going to put a gun to Putin's head
[1:40:19.440 --> 1:40:22.440]  And say, if you don't win this, you're gone, buddy boy
[1:40:22.440 --> 1:40:25.440]  And so he's going to conscript people and go to full war
[1:40:25.440 --> 1:40:30.440]  And he's going to start using bombardment tactics against civilian targets
[1:40:30.440 --> 1:40:34.440]  And now he's in the bigger trap, and now NATO publicly enters the war
[1:40:37.440 --> 1:40:39.440]  I've told you this probably 50 times on air
[1:40:40.440 --> 1:40:43.440]  It's not about being right, it's about the facts
[1:40:45.440 --> 1:40:49.440]  That Putin's at his most dangerous once he gets his ass kicked
[1:40:49.440 --> 1:40:55.440]  There's a Russophile thing out there, because we hate the New World Order
[1:40:55.440 --> 1:40:58.440]  That Russia must be perfect and super powerful
[1:40:58.440 --> 1:41:04.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, they've got a 1990s military up against the equivalent of Martian technology
[1:41:06.440 --> 1:41:08.440]  They're being slaughtered by robots
[1:41:11.440 --> 1:41:13.440]  $90 billion of them
[1:41:13.440 --> 1:41:19.440]  And now the Russians know with their general Armageddon
[1:41:19.440 --> 1:41:21.440]  That's what's nicknamed
[1:41:22.440 --> 1:41:25.440]  The only thing they can do is take over every city now
[1:41:25.440 --> 1:41:27.440]  And level Kiev
[1:41:27.440 --> 1:41:31.440]  Because as long as you leave industrial bases or any operations
[1:41:31.440 --> 1:41:37.440]  They will continue to be able to attack with unlimited force out of Poland and out of the European Union
[1:41:37.440 --> 1:41:39.440]  And that's the bad thing for the Russians
[1:41:39.440 --> 1:41:43.440]  Even if they take all of Ukraine in total war
[1:41:43.440 --> 1:41:47.440]  NATO will pump weapons in from every angle
[1:41:48.440 --> 1:41:51.440]  What do they say in the 1980s movie war games?
[1:41:51.440 --> 1:41:53.440]  The only way to win is not to play
[1:41:53.440 --> 1:41:55.440]  But we're already playing, aren't we?
[1:42:02.440 --> 1:42:04.440]  Putin has walked into a trap
[1:42:04.440 --> 1:42:08.440]  And the head of the British military is right
[1:42:10.440 --> 1:42:14.440]  He says the big danger is when Putin loses he'll use nuclear weapons
[1:42:14.440 --> 1:42:16.440]  And even if a Putin doesn't
[1:42:16.440 --> 1:42:17.440]  Now wait for it
[1:42:17.440 --> 1:42:19.440]  Even if Putin doesn't
[1:42:20.440 --> 1:42:23.440]  The globalists are going to stage a false flag with a nuclear weapon
[1:42:23.440 --> 1:42:25.440]  They'll probably blow up a nuclear reactor
[1:42:25.440 --> 1:42:27.440]  Have a huge meltdown and blame Russia
[1:42:27.440 --> 1:42:29.440]  And then everything stops
[1:42:29.440 --> 1:42:31.440]  You go, well why would they want that?
[1:42:31.440 --> 1:42:34.440]  They use Hollywood and the media to control you, they don't care about any of that
[1:42:34.440 --> 1:42:36.440]  The globalists want a reset
[1:42:36.440 --> 1:42:38.440]  They want to blow up half the planet
[1:42:38.440 --> 1:42:40.440]  They want to trick Russia to a nuclear war
[1:42:40.440 --> 1:42:42.440]  That's about to happen
[1:42:42.440 --> 1:42:46.440]  I give it a 50% chance in six months we're all dead
[1:42:46.440 --> 1:42:47.440]  So get right with God
[1:42:47.440 --> 1:42:49.440]  Because I'm telling everybody listening right now
[1:42:49.440 --> 1:42:51.440]  You're dead
[1:42:51.440 --> 1:42:54.440]  Nuclear war is about to happen unless we wake up
[1:42:54.440 --> 1:42:56.440]  Like Tulsi Gaviric did
[1:42:56.440 --> 1:43:01.440]  Think about a world without InfoWars
[1:43:01.440 --> 1:43:06.440]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests
[1:43:06.440 --> 1:43:09.440]  And callers and stories we've broken together
[1:43:09.440 --> 1:43:11.440]  This family that is InfoWars
[1:43:11.440 --> 1:43:16.440]  Think about how InfoWars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson
[1:43:16.440 --> 1:43:18.440]  And Bal Senaro and other foreign leaders
[1:43:18.440 --> 1:43:20.440]  Like Nigel Farage
[1:43:20.440 --> 1:43:26.440]  As being the main impetus towards firing up their main base
[1:43:26.440 --> 1:43:28.440]  To defeat the New World Order
[1:43:28.440 --> 1:43:32.440]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today
[1:43:32.440 --> 1:43:35.440]  Is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast
[1:43:35.440 --> 1:43:38.440]  Have taken action and supported this show
[1:43:38.440 --> 1:43:40.440]  I don't take the credit
[1:43:40.440 --> 1:43:42.440]  I give you the credit
[1:43:42.440 --> 1:43:44.440]  And now InfoWars is facing its darkest hours
[1:43:44.440 --> 1:43:46.440]  It isn't going to give up
[1:43:46.440 --> 1:43:48.440]  Without your support we can be shut down
[1:43:48.440 --> 1:43:51.440]  Please go to SaveInfoWars.com today
[1:43:51.440 --> 1:44:19.440]  And donate for our Legal Defense Fund
[1:44:21.440 --> 1:44:24.440]  For the real reason you've had the success
[1:44:24.440 --> 1:44:26.440]  We're having now the greatest victories
[1:44:26.440 --> 1:44:29.440]  In the fight against the New World Order you've ever had
[1:44:29.440 --> 1:44:34.440]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon
[1:44:34.440 --> 1:44:37.440]  And that's why today it's more important than ever
[1:44:37.440 --> 1:44:39.440]  To realize how important you've been in this fight
[1:44:39.440 --> 1:44:42.440]  And to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out
[1:44:42.440 --> 1:44:43.440]  And to intensify them
[1:44:43.440 --> 1:44:44.440]  God bless you all
[1:44:44.440 --> 1:44:45.440]  I salute you
[1:44:45.440 --> 1:44:46.440]  I thank you
[1:44:46.440 --> 1:44:49.440]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now
[1:44:49.440 --> 1:44:51.440]  Because we are over the target
[1:44:51.440 --> 1:44:52.440]  And this streak is happening
[1:44:52.440 --> 1:44:54.440]  The fight is my fight
[1:44:54.440 --> 1:44:55.440]  It's your fight
[1:44:55.440 --> 1:44:56.440]  It's our fight
[1:44:56.440 --> 1:44:58.440]  God bless you all
[1:44:58.440 --> 1:45:03.440]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the Globalist
[1:45:03.440 --> 1:45:06.440]  I have come from nowhere
[1:45:06.440 --> 1:45:08.440]  To the very heights of politics
[1:45:08.440 --> 1:45:10.440]  Not just in America but in the world
[1:45:10.440 --> 1:45:13.440]  We are engaging the Globalist at Point Blank Range
[1:45:13.440 --> 1:45:15.440]  In the Information War
[1:45:15.440 --> 1:45:17.440]  But I don't deserve the credit
[1:45:17.440 --> 1:45:18.440]  Yes, I've persevered
[1:45:18.440 --> 1:45:21.440]  But the listeners and viewers who support them for wars
[1:45:21.440 --> 1:45:24.440]  Are the real reason you've had the success
[1:45:24.440 --> 1:45:26.440]  We're having now the greatest victories
[1:45:26.440 --> 1:45:29.440]  In the fight against the New World Order you've ever had
[1:45:29.440 --> 1:45:34.440]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon
[1:45:34.440 --> 1:45:37.440]  And that's why today it's more important than ever
[1:45:37.440 --> 1:45:39.440]  To realize how important you've been in this fight
[1:45:39.440 --> 1:45:42.440]  And to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out
[1:45:42.440 --> 1:45:43.440]  And to intensify them
[1:45:43.440 --> 1:45:44.440]  God bless you all
[1:45:44.440 --> 1:45:45.440]  I salute you
[1:45:45.440 --> 1:45:46.440]  I thank you
[1:45:46.440 --> 1:45:49.440]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now
[1:45:49.440 --> 1:45:52.440]  Because we are over the target and history is happening
[1:45:52.440 --> 1:45:54.440]  The fight is my fight
[1:45:54.440 --> 1:45:55.440]  It's your fight
[1:45:55.440 --> 1:45:56.440]  It's our fight
[1:45:56.440 --> 1:46:25.440]  X3

[1:47:55.440 --> 1:47:58.440]  Letting it all hang out
[1:47:58.440 --> 1:48:01.440]  Putting it on the line
[1:48:01.440 --> 1:48:04.440]  Telling it like it is
[1:48:04.440 --> 1:48:06.440]  That's what I'm doing today
[1:48:06.440 --> 1:48:09.440]  I'll always try
[1:48:09.440 --> 1:48:11.440]  That God holds me back
[1:48:11.440 --> 1:48:14.440]  When the time's right, it's all released
[1:48:14.440 --> 1:48:16.440]  And the last hour and 48 minutes
[1:48:16.440 --> 1:48:18.440]  It's been released
[1:48:18.440 --> 1:48:21.440]  You got some heavy info today
[1:48:21.440 --> 1:48:24.440]  And believe me, world leaders are listening
[1:48:24.440 --> 1:48:26.440]  Fault leaders are listening
[1:48:26.440 --> 1:48:30.440]  Because what we're doing here is very special
[1:48:30.440 --> 1:48:33.440]  And I've not just been ordained in this mission
[1:48:33.440 --> 1:48:36.440]  You have been as well
[1:48:36.440 --> 1:48:39.440]  So make no mistake about that
[1:48:39.440 --> 1:48:41.440]  Alright, let's go to your phone calls
[1:48:41.440 --> 1:48:42.440]  I just got into this
[1:48:42.440 --> 1:48:43.440]  Be ready for nuclear war
[1:48:43.440 --> 1:48:44.440]  Putin's army collapses
[1:48:44.440 --> 1:48:46.440]  Warren's ex-nato chief
[1:48:46.440 --> 1:48:47.440]  Head of the British military
[1:48:47.440 --> 1:48:49.440]  NATO to hold nuclear deterrence
[1:48:49.440 --> 1:48:52.440]  Exercises Russia rages at Ukraine
[1:48:52.440 --> 1:48:54.440]  Biden clarifies nuclear Armageddon warning
[1:48:54.440 --> 1:48:55.440]  Says he didn't mean it
[1:48:55.440 --> 1:48:57.440]  That's where we're at
[1:48:57.440 --> 1:48:58.440]  Dark days ahead for Europe
[1:48:58.440 --> 1:48:59.440]  His lack of Russian oil
[1:48:59.440 --> 1:49:03.440]  Could spark worst energy crisis in decades
[1:49:03.440 --> 1:49:05.440]  NATO once lost underwater drone
[1:49:05.440 --> 1:49:08.440]  Under Nord Stream gas prom
[1:49:08.440 --> 1:49:10.440]  Now put on display
[1:49:10.440 --> 1:49:11.440]  Whose new Ukraine commander
[1:49:11.440 --> 1:49:13.440]  Dubbed General Armageddon
[1:49:13.440 --> 1:49:18.440]  For ruthless attack record
[1:49:18.440 --> 1:49:19.440]  Mainstream media came out
[1:49:19.440 --> 1:49:21.440]  And said Elon Musk
[1:49:21.440 --> 1:49:23.440]  Is having phone calls with Putin
[1:49:23.440 --> 1:49:24.440]  Under Putin's direction
[1:49:24.440 --> 1:49:26.440]  Musk came out and said that's totally a lie
[1:49:26.440 --> 1:49:28.440]  Of course it is
[1:49:28.440 --> 1:49:30.440]  Imagine five years ago
[1:49:30.440 --> 1:49:31.440]  When Trump was in office
[1:49:31.440 --> 1:49:33.440]  I'd watch congressional hearings
[1:49:33.440 --> 1:49:34.440]  And they'd say,
[1:49:34.440 --> 1:49:35.440]  Jones is a Russian agent
[1:49:35.440 --> 1:49:36.440]  And not show proof
[1:49:36.440 --> 1:49:37.440]  That's what they do
[1:49:37.440 --> 1:49:38.440]  They're liars
[1:49:38.440 --> 1:49:39.440]  Because I don't want nuclear war with Russia
[1:49:39.440 --> 1:49:40.440]  I'm a Russian agent
[1:49:40.440 --> 1:49:42.440]  Okay
[1:49:42.440 --> 1:49:43.440]  What are your phone calls now?
[1:49:43.440 --> 1:49:45.440]  Drew and Tov and Believer
[1:49:45.440 --> 1:49:47.440]  And Nicole and Andrew and Justin
[1:49:47.440 --> 1:49:49.440]  And Richard, Micah, Geno
[1:49:49.440 --> 1:49:50.440]  And so many others
[1:49:50.440 --> 1:49:51.440]  Drew in Texas
[1:49:51.440 --> 1:49:52.440]  You're our first caller
[1:49:52.440 --> 1:49:53.440]  Thanks for holding
[1:49:53.440 --> 1:49:56.440]  Hey, well, so now Tulsi Gabbard's a Russian agent
[1:49:56.440 --> 1:49:59.440]  I read that because she bounced from
[1:49:59.440 --> 1:50:01.440]  Sorry, Ask Democratic Party
[1:50:01.440 --> 1:50:02.440]  So she's a Russian agent
[1:50:02.440 --> 1:50:04.440]  Tulsi Gabbard doesn't want nuclear war
[1:50:04.440 --> 1:50:05.440]  So she's mad
[1:50:05.440 --> 1:50:06.440]  She's mad
[1:50:06.440 --> 1:50:08.440]  Hey, I'm going to tell you
[1:50:08.440 --> 1:50:10.440]  To all the powers that be that are listening
[1:50:10.440 --> 1:50:11.440]  I'm not a prophet
[1:50:11.440 --> 1:50:12.440]  I don't tend to be
[1:50:12.440 --> 1:50:13.440]  But I do operate
[1:50:13.440 --> 1:50:14.440]  In the gifts of the Holy Spirit
[1:50:14.440 --> 1:50:15.440]  The word of knowledge
[1:50:15.440 --> 1:50:16.440]  The word of wisdom
[1:50:16.440 --> 1:50:17.440]  Whenever he enables me
[1:50:17.440 --> 1:50:20.440]  But here's what's happening with
[1:50:20.440 --> 1:50:21.440]  With the people that push the vaccine
[1:50:21.440 --> 1:50:23.440]  Namely, chiefly, Fauci
[1:50:23.440 --> 1:50:25.440]  I hope you're listening, Fauci
[1:50:25.440 --> 1:50:27.440]  So they're going to start rolling
[1:50:27.440 --> 1:50:28.440]  And dropping dimes, right?
[1:50:28.440 --> 1:50:29.440]  People are going to start snitching
[1:50:29.440 --> 1:50:30.440]  Hey, well, they told me
[1:50:30.440 --> 1:50:32.440]  Oh, oh, oh, I'm innocent
[1:50:32.440 --> 1:50:33.440]  They told me
[1:50:33.440 --> 1:50:36.440]  Bob's just going to be the top one to go
[1:50:36.440 --> 1:50:38.440]  But he's not going to get time
[1:50:38.440 --> 1:50:39.440]  He's going to end up committing suicide
[1:50:39.440 --> 1:50:42.440]  And I hope he prays to God that he doesn't do that
[1:50:42.440 --> 1:50:43.440]  I hope and pray that he repents
[1:50:43.440 --> 1:50:44.440]  And for folks who just joined us
[1:50:44.440 --> 1:50:46.440]  A million, hundreds of thousands
[1:50:46.440 --> 1:50:47.440]  Two in every 10 minutes
[1:50:47.440 --> 1:50:50.440]  We've been talking about EU hearings
[1:50:50.440 --> 1:50:51.440]  Of admitting that the vaccine didn't work
[1:50:51.440 --> 1:50:52.440]  The total fraud
[1:50:52.440 --> 1:50:53.440]  You're saying they're going to start turning
[1:50:53.440 --> 1:50:54.440]  On each other
[1:50:54.440 --> 1:50:55.440]  It's already happening
[1:50:55.440 --> 1:50:56.440]  We've seen the last three months
[1:50:56.440 --> 1:50:58.440]  Admitting they were lied to
[1:50:58.440 --> 1:50:59.440]  Saying it's not their fault
[1:50:59.440 --> 1:51:01.440]  So the rats are leaving the sinking ship
[1:51:01.440 --> 1:51:02.440]  Yes, that's right
[1:51:02.440 --> 1:51:04.440]  And I feel bad for Fauci
[1:51:04.440 --> 1:51:06.440]  Because all he has to do is just crowd to Jesus Christ
[1:51:06.440 --> 1:51:07.440]  As God to forgive him
[1:51:07.440 --> 1:51:09.440]  Come clean and do your time
[1:51:09.440 --> 1:51:10.440]  Go do your time
[1:51:10.440 --> 1:51:11.440]  But don't take your life
[1:51:11.440 --> 1:51:12.440]  Hey, y'all have a good one
[1:51:12.440 --> 1:51:13.440]  God bless you, Alex
[1:51:13.440 --> 1:51:14.440]  God bless you, brother
[1:51:14.440 --> 1:51:15.440]  Appreciate you
[1:51:15.440 --> 1:51:16.440]  Believer in Canada
[1:51:16.440 --> 1:51:17.440]  You're on here
[1:51:17.440 --> 1:51:18.440]  Welcome
[1:51:18.440 --> 1:51:20.440]  Hi, Alex
[1:51:20.440 --> 1:51:22.440]  Just to know we love you
[1:51:22.440 --> 1:51:27.440]  And I want to talk about the general
[1:51:27.440 --> 1:51:30.440]  Overall feature of this
[1:51:30.440 --> 1:51:31.440]  Is that it is biblical
[1:51:31.440 --> 1:51:35.440]  It is Revelation 13 happening right now
[1:51:35.440 --> 1:51:40.440]  And with the globalists
[1:51:40.440 --> 1:51:44.440]  Being the beast of the sea
[1:51:44.440 --> 1:51:46.440]  I'm sorry, the beast of the sea
[1:51:46.440 --> 1:51:49.440]  And then the governments that they own
[1:51:49.440 --> 1:51:50.440]  Being the false prophet
[1:51:50.440 --> 1:51:52.440]  Or the beast of the earth
[1:51:52.440 --> 1:51:55.440]  Anyway, I just want to point out to people
[1:51:55.440 --> 1:51:57.440]  There is a wonderful website
[1:51:57.440 --> 1:52:01.440]  Called Revelation13.substack.com
[1:52:01.440 --> 1:52:03.440]  And it goes verse by verse
[1:52:03.440 --> 1:52:05.440]  For Revelation 13
[1:52:05.440 --> 1:52:08.440]  And it really does a good job
[1:52:08.440 --> 1:52:10.440]  At just letting people understand
[1:52:10.440 --> 1:52:12.440]  This is Bible prophecy happening
[1:52:12.440 --> 1:52:14.440]  Right in front of us right now
[1:52:14.440 --> 1:52:16.440]  It's happening 100%
[1:52:16.440 --> 1:52:18.440]  You can't deny it
[1:52:18.440 --> 1:52:21.440]  And none other than that
[1:52:21.440 --> 1:52:25.440]  With that, it really does mean
[1:52:25.440 --> 1:52:27.440]  We're heading toward the end of the earth
[1:52:27.440 --> 1:52:31.440]  It doesn't mean that Jesus is going to come back tomorrow
[1:52:31.440 --> 1:52:34.440]  Or the next decade
[1:52:34.440 --> 1:52:37.440]  But the fact is we are definitely now
[1:52:37.440 --> 1:52:38.440]  In the end time
[1:52:38.440 --> 1:52:40.440]  We're in the birthplace
[1:52:40.440 --> 1:52:43.440]  Yes, and that's very true
[1:52:43.440 --> 1:52:45.440]  And there's...
[1:52:45.440 --> 1:52:47.440]  I don't really truly believe Jesus is going to come back
[1:52:47.440 --> 1:52:52.440]  Until every last person who can be saved
[1:52:52.440 --> 1:52:54.440]  Is in their salvation mode
[1:52:54.440 --> 1:52:59.440]  I believe the days of Noah
[1:52:59.440 --> 1:53:00.440]  And the days of Lot point that out
[1:53:00.440 --> 1:53:02.440]  That God's not going to...
[1:53:02.440 --> 1:53:04.440]  Jesus isn't coming back
[1:53:04.440 --> 1:53:06.440]  Until every last person who can be saved
[1:53:06.440 --> 1:53:08.440]  Until there's no good men in the earth
[1:53:08.440 --> 1:53:10.440]  That's exactly right
[1:53:10.440 --> 1:53:14.440]  And I believe we're even hundreds of years away from that
[1:53:14.440 --> 1:53:16.440]  And if I may
[1:53:16.440 --> 1:53:18.440]  Now people might not believe this
[1:53:18.440 --> 1:53:21.440]  But it's like there's a great website about that
[1:53:21.440 --> 1:53:23.440]  Called worldwarnings.com
[1:53:23.440 --> 1:53:26.440]  It goes line by line
[1:53:26.440 --> 1:53:28.440]  Or step by step I should say
[1:53:28.440 --> 1:53:30.440]  Not line by line, but step by step as to
[1:53:30.440 --> 1:53:32.440]  There is Bible prophecy
[1:53:32.440 --> 1:53:34.440]  Daniel 12 predicted
[1:53:34.440 --> 1:53:36.440]  When Jesus was here the first time
[1:53:36.440 --> 1:53:38.440]  I'm sorry, Daniel 9 predicted
[1:53:38.440 --> 1:53:40.440]  When Jesus was here the first time
[1:53:40.440 --> 1:53:42.440]  Daniel 12 predicts
[1:53:42.440 --> 1:53:44.440]  In parallel to that prophecy
[1:53:44.440 --> 1:53:46.440]  When the time frame
[1:53:46.440 --> 1:53:48.440]  When he's coming back
[1:53:48.440 --> 1:53:50.440]  And I'm not going to spoil it all
[1:53:50.440 --> 1:53:52.440]  With that time frame
[1:53:52.440 --> 1:53:56.440]  But it's not too far away
[1:53:56.440 --> 1:53:58.440]  You're talking within a few lifetimes
[1:53:58.440 --> 1:54:00.440]  Let's say somebody lives
[1:54:00.440 --> 1:54:02.440]  To 80 years old and another person
[1:54:02.440 --> 1:54:04.440]  Satan is just getting warmed up right now
[1:54:04.440 --> 1:54:06.440]  This is a precursor of what they want
[1:54:06.440 --> 1:54:08.440]  Yes, and so
[1:54:08.440 --> 1:54:10.440]  You're talking...
[1:54:10.440 --> 1:54:12.440]  I'll give you the time frame
[1:54:12.440 --> 1:54:14.440]  Now there's three different years in that time frame
[1:54:14.440 --> 1:54:16.440]  That Daniel 12 points to
[1:54:16.440 --> 1:54:18.440]  I'm not going to give those away
[1:54:18.440 --> 1:54:20.440]  I know what they are from reading that prophecy
[1:54:20.440 --> 1:54:22.440]  And the dialogue on that
[1:54:22.440 --> 1:54:24.440]  Worldwarnings.com website
[1:54:24.440 --> 1:54:26.440]  Explain why this works this way
[1:54:26.440 --> 1:54:28.440]  Evil has waves, good has waves
[1:54:28.440 --> 1:54:30.440]  And so they'll attack
[1:54:30.440 --> 1:54:32.440]  We'll push back
[1:54:32.440 --> 1:54:34.440]  And there's finally a time where the evil wave
[1:54:34.440 --> 1:54:36.440]  Overcomes the saints
[1:54:36.440 --> 1:54:38.440]  And it's full satanic control
[1:54:38.440 --> 1:54:40.440]  And then that's when it all kicks off
[1:54:40.440 --> 1:54:42.440]  Yes, and we're pretty much right there now
[1:54:42.440 --> 1:54:44.440]  And so
[1:54:44.440 --> 1:54:46.440]  Again, we're at the Revelation 13
[1:54:46.440 --> 1:54:48.440]  But still there has to be enough time left
[1:54:48.440 --> 1:54:50.440]  For
[1:54:50.440 --> 1:54:52.440]  You know, there's the seals
[1:54:52.440 --> 1:54:54.440]  The trumpets and the plagues
[1:54:54.440 --> 1:54:56.440]  And the seals are first
[1:54:56.440 --> 1:54:58.440]  The trumpets and plagues are after that
[1:54:58.440 --> 1:55:00.440]  And we're not even done the seals yet, I don't think
[1:55:00.440 --> 1:55:02.440]  And if you look at the Satanists, they're trying to
[1:55:02.440 --> 1:55:04.440]  They admit with a great reset
[1:55:04.440 --> 1:55:06.440]  They're trying to initiate Revelation before
[1:55:06.440 --> 1:55:08.440]  That's what they're scared of
[1:55:08.440 --> 1:55:10.440]  They're trying to do what's going to happen early
[1:55:10.440 --> 1:55:12.440]  To control it
[1:55:12.440 --> 1:55:14.440]  Well, of course, you know and I know
[1:55:14.440 --> 1:55:16.440]  And God knows that
[1:55:16.440 --> 1:55:18.440]  They're devils
[1:55:18.440 --> 1:55:20.440]  Anybody can repent for sure
[1:55:20.440 --> 1:55:22.440]  Obviously, evil's going to
[1:55:22.440 --> 1:55:24.440]  Win until
[1:55:24.440 --> 1:55:26.440]  Nobody is left
[1:55:26.440 --> 1:55:28.440]  On the earth
[1:55:28.440 --> 1:55:30.440]  Except for a few believers at the end
[1:55:30.440 --> 1:55:32.440]  Well, if God hadn't intervened
[1:55:32.440 --> 1:55:34.440]  There'd be no flesh spared
[1:55:34.440 --> 1:55:36.440]  Well, that's correct
[1:55:36.440 --> 1:55:38.440]  That's just being humans
[1:55:38.440 --> 1:55:40.440]  We mean total death worldwide of all life
[1:55:40.440 --> 1:55:42.440]  Absolutely
[1:55:42.440 --> 1:55:44.440]  Sin's going to be the destruction
[1:55:44.440 --> 1:55:46.440]  Of the world for sure
[1:55:46.440 --> 1:55:48.440]  And there'll only be a very few
[1:55:48.440 --> 1:55:50.440]  Number of people left at the end
[1:55:50.440 --> 1:55:52.440]  When Jesus comes back
[1:55:52.440 --> 1:55:54.440]  He'll take the living
[1:55:54.440 --> 1:55:56.440]  You know, they'll go into the air first
[1:55:56.440 --> 1:55:58.440]  And then the dead will rise out of the graves
[1:55:58.440 --> 1:56:00.440]  In the resurrection and meet them in the air
[1:56:00.440 --> 1:56:02.440]  And then, so fine
[1:56:02.440 --> 1:56:04.440]  And then all the wicked will be destroyed
[1:56:04.440 --> 1:56:06.440]  And so most of the wicked
[1:56:06.440 --> 1:56:08.440]  Or most of the earth at the end
[1:56:08.440 --> 1:56:10.440]  Will be almost entirely wicked
[1:56:10.440 --> 1:56:12.440]  People who will be destroyed by Jesus Christ
[1:56:12.440 --> 1:56:14.440]  When he comes back
[1:56:14.440 --> 1:56:16.440]  And it's hard to tell that to unbelievers
[1:56:16.440 --> 1:56:18.440]  I think, no, no, he's God's all love
[1:56:18.440 --> 1:56:20.440]  Yes, but he's also all truth
[1:56:20.440 --> 1:56:22.440]  And it's not just love
[1:56:22.440 --> 1:56:24.440]  There's also truth
[1:56:24.440 --> 1:56:26.440]  And they both have to be imperfect people
[1:56:26.440 --> 1:56:28.440]  Well, if you've chosen Satan, you're going to be destroyed
[1:56:28.440 --> 1:56:30.440]  Well, that's true
[1:56:30.440 --> 1:56:32.440]  And so
[1:56:32.440 --> 1:56:34.440]  But anyway, I won't take more of your time
[1:56:34.440 --> 1:56:36.440]  Well, God bless you, great points, believer
[1:56:36.440 --> 1:56:38.440]  Alright, Nicole, when you come back
[1:56:38.440 --> 1:56:40.440]  We're going to write to you
[1:56:40.440 --> 1:56:42.440]  Some other caller should add
[1:56:42.440 --> 1:56:44.440]  This is all biblical, folks
[1:56:44.440 --> 1:56:46.440]  You see the different government heads
[1:56:46.440 --> 1:56:48.440]  Now are admitted Satanists
[1:56:48.440 --> 1:56:50.440]  They're coming out in the open
[1:56:50.440 --> 1:56:52.440]  And whether we're going to see
[1:56:52.440 --> 1:56:54.440]  Armageddon in a year or a hundred years
[1:56:54.440 --> 1:56:56.440]  I tend to agree with the caller, it's out of ways
[1:56:56.440 --> 1:56:58.440]  There are many antichrists
[1:56:58.440 --> 1:57:00.440]  The Bible says they tried over and over again
[1:57:00.440 --> 1:57:02.440]  Until they have their perfected antichrist
[1:57:02.440 --> 1:57:04.440]  They believe, puts a beta test
[1:57:04.440 --> 1:57:06.440]  Of what Satan's will is

[2:00:18.440 --> 2:00:20.440]  Live from the
[2:00:20.440 --> 2:00:22.440]  InfoWars.com studios
[2:00:22.440 --> 2:00:24.440]  It's Alex Jones
[2:00:24.440 --> 2:00:26.440]  Alright, Nicole in Florida, thanks for calling
[2:00:26.440 --> 2:00:28.440]  Thanks for holding your own Year of World Live
[2:00:28.440 --> 2:00:30.440]  Hi Mr. Jones, happy to talk to you
[2:00:30.440 --> 2:00:32.440]  I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed your book
[2:00:32.440 --> 2:00:34.440]  It is packed with infant
[2:00:34.440 --> 2:00:36.440]  But it's not a hard read
[2:00:36.440 --> 2:00:38.440]  I tore through it
[2:00:38.440 --> 2:00:40.440]  And I got the one on Amazon
[2:00:40.440 --> 2:00:42.440]  And shortly afterwards my dad said
[2:00:42.440 --> 2:00:44.440]  It's your birthday
[2:00:44.440 --> 2:00:46.440]  Because you kept saying you didn't know what you wanted
[2:00:46.440 --> 2:00:48.440]  And I said I would love to have the autograph
[2:00:48.440 --> 2:00:50.440]  Version of this book
[2:00:50.440 --> 2:00:52.440]  I just can't justify spending that much money
[2:00:52.440 --> 2:00:54.440]  So he got me the autographed one
[2:00:54.440 --> 2:00:56.440]  And now I passed on the Amazon one
[2:00:56.440 --> 2:00:58.440]  To my brother
[2:00:58.440 --> 2:01:00.440]  Let me thank your father
[2:01:00.440 --> 2:01:02.440]  And again we're doing that as an emergency fundraiser
[2:01:02.440 --> 2:01:04.440]  We would not be on air right now
[2:01:04.440 --> 2:01:06.440]  It wasn't folks that bought the signed copy
[2:01:06.440 --> 2:01:08.440]  So I want to thank your father, Nicole
[2:01:08.440 --> 2:01:10.440]  Yeah, and thank you for writing it
[2:01:10.440 --> 2:01:12.440]  My plan is we have this little free
[2:01:12.440 --> 2:01:14.440]  Take a book, leave a book
[2:01:14.440 --> 2:01:16.440]  Library in the neighborhood
[2:01:16.440 --> 2:01:18.440]  It's like a mailbox post
[2:01:18.440 --> 2:01:20.440]  It's a little box where people can put books in there
[2:01:20.440 --> 2:01:22.440]  That's where it's going when he's done with it
[2:01:22.440 --> 2:01:24.440]  And I just want to encourage other people to do that
[2:01:24.440 --> 2:01:26.440]  Like if you can afford to get an extra copy
[2:01:26.440 --> 2:01:28.440]  Put it in one of those little libraries
[2:01:28.440 --> 2:01:30.440]  Or leave it in a motel
[2:01:30.440 --> 2:01:32.440]  Nightstand like the Gideon Bible
[2:01:32.440 --> 2:01:34.440]  Put it out there so other people
[2:01:34.440 --> 2:01:36.440]  Who might not have heard of it
[2:01:36.440 --> 2:01:38.440]  Might say hey that looks interesting
[2:01:38.440 --> 2:01:40.440]  Maybe I'll read that while I'm here
[2:01:40.440 --> 2:01:42.440]  That's how we plant the seeds of victory
[2:01:42.440 --> 2:01:44.440]  Perfectly said, your view on the great reset
[2:01:44.440 --> 2:01:46.440]  Over the world
[2:01:46.440 --> 2:01:48.440]  They're definitely making progress
[2:01:48.440 --> 2:01:50.440]  But I think we still have a chance to stop them
[2:01:50.440 --> 2:01:52.440]  If we get enough people awake
[2:01:52.440 --> 2:01:54.440]  And the other thing I wanted to mention
[2:01:54.440 --> 2:01:56.440]  Was an idea for a t-shirt
[2:01:56.440 --> 2:01:58.440]  You saved the frog shirts that you did
[2:01:58.440 --> 2:02:00.440]  I didn't see them until
[2:02:00.440 --> 2:02:02.440]  They were almost sold out and I didn't get one
[2:02:02.440 --> 2:02:04.440]  But I think it would be great if you did those again
[2:02:04.440 --> 2:02:06.440]  Especially with like a big color graphic
[2:02:06.440 --> 2:02:08.440]  On the back because it would be a good conversation
[2:02:08.440 --> 2:02:10.440]  Starter, especially with people
[2:02:10.440 --> 2:02:12.440]  Who might be on the left and more environmentally minded
[2:02:12.440 --> 2:02:14.440]  Like well what is this about
[2:02:14.440 --> 2:02:16.440]  Save the frogs, I care about the environment
[2:02:16.440 --> 2:02:18.440]  And then you can start a conversation
[2:02:18.440 --> 2:02:20.440]  Almost like a concert t-shirt
[2:02:20.440 --> 2:02:22.440]  Like facts about Atrazine
[2:02:22.440 --> 2:02:24.440]  Facts about frog popular, I agree
[2:02:24.440 --> 2:02:26.440]  We told folks we were selling all the t-shirts
[2:02:26.440 --> 2:02:28.440]  And we did it, now we're going to have some limited editions
[2:02:28.440 --> 2:02:30.440]  We've been so busy we haven't done it
[2:02:30.440 --> 2:02:32.440]  But yeah we're going to bring back some t-shirts
[2:02:32.440 --> 2:02:34.440]  Some new limited editions and the save the frogs
[2:02:34.440 --> 2:02:36.440]  One is going to be first and foremost
[2:02:36.440 --> 2:02:38.440]  Thanks for reminding me, Nicole
[2:02:38.440 --> 2:02:40.440]  Great, I would love to get one when you come out with it
[2:02:40.440 --> 2:02:42.440]  Thank you so much, Mr. Jones, you're doing a great job
[2:02:42.440 --> 2:02:44.440]  I'm trying, thank you so much, Nicole
[2:02:44.440 --> 2:02:46.440]  Andrew in the great city of Texas
[2:02:46.440 --> 2:02:48.440]  You're on the air, welcome
[2:02:48.440 --> 2:02:50.440]  Hello Alex, I'm with the North Texas
[2:02:50.440 --> 2:02:52.440]  Chapter of the John Birch Society
[2:02:52.440 --> 2:02:54.440]  And I wanted to tell you first that I love your B12 product
[2:02:54.440 --> 2:02:56.440]  Because I cannot absorb
[2:02:56.440 --> 2:02:58.440]  B12 in any other way
[2:02:58.440 --> 2:03:00.440]  I have a genetic deficiency and your product's
[2:03:00.440 --> 2:03:02.440]  Very, very good
[2:03:02.440 --> 2:03:04.440]  The Europeans can't absorb it through the gut
[2:03:04.440 --> 2:03:06.440]  Only through the blood vessels
[2:03:06.440 --> 2:03:08.440]  Under the tongue or by injection
[2:03:08.440 --> 2:03:10.440]  I have the same genetic deficiency
[2:03:10.440 --> 2:03:12.440]  So that's why B12 is so important for Northern Europeans
[2:03:12.440 --> 2:03:14.440]  It's amazing
[2:03:14.440 --> 2:03:16.440]  What I wanted to tell you is we had a meeting
[2:03:16.440 --> 2:03:18.440]  At our North Texas chapter yesterday
[2:03:18.440 --> 2:03:20.440]  With a lady named Jackie Schlegel
[2:03:20.440 --> 2:03:22.440]  From Texans for medical
[2:03:22.440 --> 2:03:24.440]  Freedom
[2:03:24.440 --> 2:03:26.440]  And she has been instrumental in getting laws
[2:03:26.440 --> 2:03:28.440]  Passed here in the state of Texas
[2:03:28.440 --> 2:03:30.440]  Completely prohibiting the institution
[2:03:30.440 --> 2:03:32.440]  Of vaccine passport systems
[2:03:32.440 --> 2:03:34.440]  You need to have her on her show
[2:03:34.440 --> 2:03:36.440]  And maybe tell your friend on Spotify about her too
[2:03:36.440 --> 2:03:38.440]  She's doing the good Lord's work with it
[2:03:38.440 --> 2:03:40.440]  No, I totally agree because Bill Gates and others are dumping
[2:03:40.440 --> 2:03:42.440]  Hundreds of millions in to bring in the world at e-card
[2:03:42.440 --> 2:03:44.440]  That is a critical thing to defeat
[2:03:44.440 --> 2:03:46.440]  You're right
[2:03:46.440 --> 2:03:48.440]  What's her name? It's Jackie Schlegel
[2:03:48.440 --> 2:03:50.440]  Schlegel
[2:03:50.440 --> 2:03:52.440]  Yes, Schlegel
[2:03:52.440 --> 2:03:54.440]  And I can give her your contact information
[2:03:54.440 --> 2:03:56.440]  I told her on the live stream
[2:03:56.440 --> 2:03:58.440]  The live streamed our meeting
[2:03:58.440 --> 2:04:00.440]  I told her have you talked to Alex Jones
[2:04:00.440 --> 2:04:02.440]  He's down in Austin, he's a local celebrity
[2:04:02.440 --> 2:04:04.440]  Down there
[2:04:04.440 --> 2:04:06.440]  You're down there all the time for legislation
[2:04:06.440 --> 2:04:08.440]  It's amazing you guys haven't linked up
[2:04:08.440 --> 2:04:10.440]  She's doing really good work
[2:04:10.440 --> 2:04:12.440]  Sounds good brother because we got to get ahead
[2:04:12.440 --> 2:04:14.440]  Of this world ID
[2:04:14.440 --> 2:04:16.440]  That's the heart of their whole program
[2:04:16.440 --> 2:04:18.440]  Yes, and she feels the same way
[2:04:18.440 --> 2:04:20.440]  Social control, she wants to completely destroy that
[2:04:20.440 --> 2:04:22.440]  Starting at the local level
[2:04:22.440 --> 2:04:24.440]  But getting her on your platform
[2:04:24.440 --> 2:04:26.440]  I think is key to getting this
[2:04:26.440 --> 2:04:28.440]  Going out into the stratosphere
[2:04:28.440 --> 2:04:30.440]  I hear you Andrew, thank you so much
[2:04:30.440 --> 2:04:32.440]  Justin, Richard, Micah
[2:04:32.440 --> 2:04:34.440]  Tav, Bill
[2:04:34.440 --> 2:04:36.440]  Dr. John, James, Melissa
[2:04:36.440 --> 2:04:38.440]  Your calls are all coming up, bam bam bam
[2:04:38.440 --> 2:04:40.440]  In 60 seconds
[2:04:40.440 --> 2:04:42.440]  And then we have a special guest about to tell you about
[2:04:42.440 --> 2:04:44.440]  That is coming up
[2:04:44.440 --> 2:04:46.440]  Infowars.com tomorrow is this today
[2:04:46.440 --> 2:04:48.440]  We're going live until midnight tonight
[2:04:48.440 --> 2:04:50.440]  So please everybody you know special emergency broadcasts
[2:04:50.440 --> 2:04:52.440]  Infowars.com
[2:04:52.440 --> 2:04:56.440]  This is our show and band.video
[2:04:58.440 --> 2:05:00.440]  It's our best seller
[2:05:00.440 --> 2:05:02.440]  We first came out with it five years ago
[2:05:02.440 --> 2:05:04.440]  And it was a moderate seller
[2:05:04.440 --> 2:05:06.440]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion
[2:05:06.440 --> 2:05:08.440]  And experienced the way it made it feel
[2:05:08.440 --> 2:05:10.440]  And how healthy it made them
[2:05:10.440 --> 2:05:12.440]  It has become our number one overall best seller
[2:05:12.440 --> 2:05:14.440]  And it's been sold out for a while
[2:05:14.440 --> 2:05:16.440]  But it's finally back in stock
[2:05:16.440 --> 2:05:18.440]  Vitamin mineral fusion does it just supercharge
[2:05:18.440 --> 2:05:20.440]  Your immune system
[2:05:20.440 --> 2:05:22.440]  It has three cellular functions in the body
[2:05:22.440 --> 2:05:24.440]  It has all the minerals
[2:05:24.440 --> 2:05:26.440]  All the key amino acids
[2:05:26.440 --> 2:05:28.440]  All of the essential vitamins that you need to live
[2:05:28.440 --> 2:05:30.440]  And be healthy
[2:05:30.440 --> 2:05:32.440]  Essential means without these things you die
[2:05:32.440 --> 2:05:34.440]  And so much the food is debased
[2:05:34.440 --> 2:05:36.440]  There's so many chemicals in the environment
[2:05:36.440 --> 2:05:38.440]  It is critical to bolster our body's defenses
[2:05:38.440 --> 2:05:40.440]  With a product like this
[2:05:40.440 --> 2:05:42.440]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there
[2:05:42.440 --> 2:05:44.440]  But this is amongst the very best
[2:05:44.440 --> 2:05:46.440]  And it's a low price and it funds the info war
[2:05:46.440 --> 2:05:48.440]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today

[2:06:24.440 --> 2:06:26.440]  And then it starts to lose
[2:06:26.440 --> 2:06:28.440]  And it freaks out and doubles down
[2:06:28.440 --> 2:06:30.440]  And then humanity awakens
[2:06:30.440 --> 2:06:32.440]  And rises
[2:06:32.440 --> 2:06:34.440]  And defeats them

[2:07:20.440 --> 2:07:22.440]  You name it tonight
[2:07:22.440 --> 2:07:24.440]  Starting at 6pm Central

[2:07:28.440 --> 2:07:30.440]  Alright Justin in Kansas we're on the order the calls are received
[2:07:30.440 --> 2:07:32.440]  Go ahead Justin
[2:07:32.440 --> 2:07:34.440]  Hey Alex, love you brother
[2:07:34.440 --> 2:07:36.440]  Love you
[2:07:36.440 --> 2:07:38.440]  Hey first real quick
[2:07:38.440 --> 2:07:40.440]  I wanted to tell you that you're spot on about heaven
[2:07:40.440 --> 2:07:42.440]  When I was 26
[2:07:42.440 --> 2:07:44.440]  After years of drug abuse
[2:07:44.440 --> 2:07:46.440]  I was saved
[2:07:46.440 --> 2:07:48.440]  I asked God and the Holy Spirit to come into me
[2:07:48.440 --> 2:07:50.440]  Soon after I had a dream
[2:07:50.440 --> 2:07:52.440]  That Jesus came to me and
[2:07:52.440 --> 2:07:54.440]  Revealed to me a little bit
[2:07:54.440 --> 2:07:56.440]  Of what heaven would feel like
[2:07:56.440 --> 2:07:58.440]  I won't go into the details but it was
[2:07:58.440 --> 2:08:00.440]  Better than any needle
[2:08:00.440 --> 2:08:02.440]  Better than any pipe
[2:08:02.440 --> 2:08:04.440]  I mean a thousand times that
[2:08:04.440 --> 2:08:06.440]  And that was just a piece of what it would feel like
[2:08:06.440 --> 2:08:08.440]  Piece is the word I'm called completion
[2:08:08.440 --> 2:08:10.440]  It's just like I'm done
[2:08:10.440 --> 2:08:12.440]  This is everything I need forever
[2:08:12.440 --> 2:08:14.440]  It's just like wow
[2:08:14.440 --> 2:08:16.440]  Yeah and don't be fooled
[2:08:16.440 --> 2:08:18.440]  Because if it wasn't they would just
[2:08:18.440 --> 2:08:20.440]  Kill us right away
[2:08:20.440 --> 2:08:22.440]  They want to demoralize us
[2:08:22.440 --> 2:08:24.440]  And then have us curse
[2:08:24.440 --> 2:08:26.440]  God and come to them
[2:08:26.440 --> 2:08:28.440]  That's what this is
[2:08:28.440 --> 2:08:30.440]  So we need to get out and we need to
[2:08:30.440 --> 2:08:32.440]  Protest peacefully but not
[2:08:32.440 --> 2:08:34.440]  In anything political
[2:08:34.440 --> 2:08:36.440]  There's so many things that are going on
[2:08:36.440 --> 2:08:38.440]  I think we need to scandalize vigils
[2:08:38.440 --> 2:08:40.440]  With messages of peace and love for our enemies
[2:08:40.440 --> 2:08:42.440]  We also need to have
[2:08:42.440 --> 2:08:44.440]  Like immune system
[2:08:44.440 --> 2:08:46.440]  For protest
[2:08:46.440 --> 2:08:48.440]  We need people with signs that say
[2:08:48.440 --> 2:08:50.440]  They are not with us
[2:08:50.440 --> 2:08:52.440]  So if any infiltrators come in
[2:08:52.440 --> 2:08:54.440]  And try to have swastikas
[2:08:54.440 --> 2:08:56.440]  Or any crazy stuff like that
[2:08:56.440 --> 2:08:58.440]  No it's always the southern poverty loss
[2:08:58.440 --> 2:09:00.440]  And they all even catch them
[2:09:00.440 --> 2:09:02.440]  There aren't really real white supremacist folks
[2:09:02.440 --> 2:09:04.440]  It's like finding a
[2:09:04.440 --> 2:09:06.440]  Unicorn or something
[2:09:06.440 --> 2:09:08.440]  It's all made up, it's leftist dressed up
[2:09:08.440 --> 2:09:10.440]  It's just so disgusting
[2:09:10.440 --> 2:09:12.440]  Thanks for the call brother
[2:09:12.440 --> 2:09:14.440]  I didn't read the call comments
[2:09:14.440 --> 2:09:16.440]  Disagrees
[2:09:16.440 --> 2:09:18.440]  So I should have gone to you the head of the line
[2:09:18.440 --> 2:09:20.440]  I apologize Richard, my rule is
[2:09:20.440 --> 2:09:22.440]  Go to folks that scream the head of the line
[2:09:22.440 --> 2:09:24.440]  Alex Jones wrong about nuclear war
[2:09:24.440 --> 2:09:26.440]  Okay Richard, I hope you're right
[2:09:26.440 --> 2:09:28.440]  Tell me about it from Kentucky
[2:09:28.440 --> 2:09:30.440]  Okay Alex
[2:09:30.440 --> 2:09:32.440]  Revelation 18
[2:09:32.440 --> 2:09:34.440]  Talks about the fall of bail
[2:09:34.440 --> 2:09:36.440]  Two years ago God revealed something to me
[2:09:36.440 --> 2:09:38.440]  And I hope the audience understands
[2:09:38.440 --> 2:09:40.440]  And read that verse
[2:09:40.440 --> 2:09:42.440]  And said it was going to be a volcano
[2:09:42.440 --> 2:09:44.440]  Yellowstone National Park
[2:09:44.440 --> 2:09:46.440]  On the east coast of America
[2:09:46.440 --> 2:09:48.440]  I couldn't figure out where the one on the east coast was
[2:09:48.440 --> 2:09:50.440]  So it went on and on and found it
[2:09:50.440 --> 2:09:52.440]  He showed me, it was right in Washington DC
[2:09:52.440 --> 2:09:54.440]  18th house, the White House
[2:09:54.440 --> 2:09:56.440]  So it kept going on and on
[2:09:56.440 --> 2:09:58.440]  I kept seeing this vision and I asked him
[2:09:58.440 --> 2:10:00.440]  Rebuild some more to me
[2:10:00.440 --> 2:10:02.440]  And then he showed me a movie one day
[2:10:02.440 --> 2:10:04.440]  I was setting him in my wife
[2:10:04.440 --> 2:10:06.440]  2012
[2:10:06.440 --> 2:10:08.440]  It talks about a volcano at Yellowstone
[2:10:08.440 --> 2:10:10.440]  Also talked about the earthquake
[2:10:10.440 --> 2:10:12.440]  At Washington DC
[2:10:12.440 --> 2:10:14.440]  But it destroys the world
[2:10:14.440 --> 2:10:16.440]  It's not going to destroy the world
[2:10:16.440 --> 2:10:18.440]  It's going to destroy Canada, Mexico
[2:10:18.440 --> 2:10:20.440]  And America
[2:10:20.440 --> 2:10:22.440]  And if there's a nuclear war
[2:10:22.440 --> 2:10:24.440]  According to Revelation 18
[2:10:24.440 --> 2:10:26.440]  The rest of the world couldn't watch it on pay-per-view
[2:10:26.440 --> 2:10:28.440]  That's what it says in that verse
[2:10:28.440 --> 2:10:30.440]  But I go about it first
[2:10:30.440 --> 2:10:32.440]  The whole world will watch the fall of Babylon
[2:10:32.440 --> 2:10:34.440]  That's right
[2:10:34.440 --> 2:10:36.440]  How can somebody watch the fall of Babylon
[2:10:36.440 --> 2:10:38.440]  Yeah
[2:10:38.440 --> 2:10:40.440]  On pay-per-view
[2:10:40.440 --> 2:10:42.440]  Because that's what's happening right now
[2:10:42.440 --> 2:10:44.440]  You can watch pay-per-view around the world
[2:10:44.440 --> 2:10:46.440]  And you're going to destroy this country
[2:10:46.440 --> 2:10:48.440]  Just like you destroyed the rest of the countries
[2:10:48.440 --> 2:10:50.440]  Who turned against him
[2:10:50.440 --> 2:10:52.440]  Look at what we're doing, Alex
[2:10:52.440 --> 2:10:54.440]  The globalists know
[2:10:54.440 --> 2:10:56.440]  Pedophile, drag queen story time
[2:10:56.440 --> 2:10:58.440]  All of these abortions are curses
[2:10:58.440 --> 2:11:00.440]  And if you do it, you will be cursed
[2:11:00.440 --> 2:11:02.440]  You will be destroyed
[2:11:02.440 --> 2:11:04.440]  And they're doing it on purpose
[2:11:04.440 --> 2:11:06.440]  And I agree with you
[2:11:06.440 --> 2:11:08.440]  Once you destroy America
[2:11:08.440 --> 2:11:10.440]  That's when the Roman Empire
[2:11:10.440 --> 2:11:12.440]  Rides up overseas
[2:11:12.440 --> 2:11:14.440]  I'm not disagreeing with you
[2:11:14.440 --> 2:11:16.440]  We don't disagree
[2:11:16.440 --> 2:11:18.440]  I don't know what's going to happen
[2:11:18.440 --> 2:11:20.440]  I just know this is evil
[2:11:20.440 --> 2:11:22.440]  And I'm not up here like some preacher
[2:11:22.440 --> 2:11:24.440]  I'm not a perfect person
[2:11:24.440 --> 2:11:26.440]  I don't cheat people
[2:11:26.440 --> 2:11:28.440]  I don't steal from people
[2:11:28.440 --> 2:11:30.440]  I've been a womanizer
[2:11:30.440 --> 2:11:32.440]  And I've gotten better about it over the years
[2:11:32.440 --> 2:11:34.440]  I like to drink
[2:11:34.440 --> 2:11:36.440]  And God made me the way I am
[2:11:36.440 --> 2:11:38.440]  I've gotten a lot better about all of it
[2:11:38.440 --> 2:11:40.440]  I'm not going to sell anybody out
[2:11:40.440 --> 2:11:42.440]  I don't serve Satan
[2:11:42.440 --> 2:11:44.440]  I'll only tell you all that
[2:11:44.440 --> 2:11:46.440]  Because I'm not one of these fake preachers
[2:11:46.440 --> 2:11:48.440]  On Sunday telling you how good they are
[2:11:48.440 --> 2:11:50.440]  And telling you how bad you are
[2:11:50.440 --> 2:11:52.440]  I love God, I love children, I love freedom
[2:11:52.440 --> 2:11:54.440]  And I will not be part of their satanic operation
[2:11:54.440 --> 2:11:56.440]  But don't look to me like I'm Jesus
[2:11:56.440 --> 2:11:58.440]  Because I'm not
[2:11:58.440 --> 2:12:00.440]  I'm a fallen devil that loves God
[2:12:00.440 --> 2:12:02.440]  Jesus Christ
[2:12:02.440 --> 2:12:04.440]  And the only reason I can do what I do
[2:12:04.440 --> 2:12:06.440]  Is because of the power God gave me
[2:12:06.440 --> 2:12:08.440]  Through His Son Jesus Christ has saved me
[2:12:08.440 --> 2:12:10.440]  Let's go ahead and talk to Micah
[2:12:10.440 --> 2:12:12.440]  In North Carolina, you're on the air
[2:12:12.440 --> 2:12:14.440]  Hey Alex, amen actually
[2:12:14.440 --> 2:12:16.440]  For what you just said
[2:12:16.440 --> 2:12:18.440]  I actually just wanted to go on a little rant today
[2:12:18.440 --> 2:12:20.440]  About the nuclear war
[2:12:20.440 --> 2:12:22.440]  I mean it's definitely looming on the horizon
[2:12:22.440 --> 2:12:24.440]  But we have to stop this
[2:12:24.440 --> 2:12:26.440]  We have no other choice
[2:12:26.440 --> 2:12:28.440]  I mean I've heard it a few times on the show
[2:12:28.440 --> 2:12:30.440]  We're turning our flags upside down
[2:12:30.440 --> 2:12:32.440]  Maybe it's a way to show that we don't stand with these
[2:12:32.440 --> 2:12:34.440]  Now that's a great idea, it doesn't mean you're against America
[2:12:34.440 --> 2:12:36.440]  When your neighbor asked, it means we're in an emergency
[2:12:36.440 --> 2:12:40.440]  Yes, there's actually precedent for it
[2:12:40.440 --> 2:12:42.440]  But yeah, I mean we need to start
[2:12:42.440 --> 2:12:44.440]  Turning our flags upside down everywhere
[2:12:44.440 --> 2:12:46.440]  If you have a flag turned upside down
[2:12:46.440 --> 2:12:48.440]  Especially the largest one
[2:12:48.440 --> 2:12:50.440]  It'll draw up publicity
[2:12:50.440 --> 2:12:52.440]  I agree with restaurants and places winning
[2:12:52.440 --> 2:12:54.440]  The media would come and ask and say
[2:12:54.440 --> 2:12:56.440]  Hey, America's in SOS
[2:12:56.440 --> 2:12:58.440]  The stress signal
[2:12:58.440 --> 2:13:00.440]  He's destroyed the borders
[2:13:00.440 --> 2:13:02.440]  He's cutting off our energy
[2:13:02.440 --> 2:13:04.440]  He's starting nuclear war
[2:13:04.440 --> 2:13:06.440]  Damn right, we need the flag falling upside down
[2:13:06.440 --> 2:13:08.440]  That's a sign of respect
[2:13:08.440 --> 2:13:10.440]  That the country's in trouble
[2:13:10.440 --> 2:13:12.440]  Our country is diseased
[2:13:12.440 --> 2:13:14.440]  With corruption and evil
[2:13:14.440 --> 2:13:16.440]  Our fate is in our own hands
[2:13:16.440 --> 2:13:18.440]  Yes, God will win
[2:13:18.440 --> 2:13:20.440]  But without action, we won't see it
[2:13:20.440 --> 2:13:22.440]  Exactly, you only show the flag
[2:13:22.440 --> 2:13:24.440]  To show the condition
[2:13:24.440 --> 2:13:26.440]  We have a black flag with a black spot
[2:13:26.440 --> 2:13:28.440]  You're telling other ships, don't come over here
[2:13:28.440 --> 2:13:30.440]  We've got bubonic plague
[2:13:30.440 --> 2:13:32.440]  This is, we love America, but it's upside down
[2:13:32.440 --> 2:13:34.440]  Obama, this third administration
[2:13:34.440 --> 2:13:36.440]  Biden has turned the country upside down
[2:13:36.440 --> 2:13:38.440]  You're absolutely right
[2:13:38.440 --> 2:13:40.440]  Our flag should be upside down
[2:13:40.440 --> 2:13:42.440]  To tell everybody we're in distress
[2:13:42.440 --> 2:13:44.440]  Yeah, I mean, because like you said
[2:13:44.440 --> 2:13:46.440]  You know, they want to start revelation
[2:13:46.440 --> 2:13:48.440]  Before it even happens
[2:13:48.440 --> 2:13:50.440]  We can't allow it to happen
[2:13:50.440 --> 2:13:52.440]  Because we won't even see the revelation
[2:13:52.440 --> 2:13:54.440]  Because we won't be here
[2:13:54.440 --> 2:13:56.440]  I mean...
[2:13:56.440 --> 2:13:58.440]  Well, their attempt is going to fail
[2:13:58.440 --> 2:14:00.440]  But they know God's plan, I figured it out
[2:14:00.440 --> 2:14:02.440]  Some of you, they're trying to trigger it early
[2:14:02.440 --> 2:14:04.440]  And trying to play it out
[2:14:04.440 --> 2:14:06.440]  It's a joke, it's not going to work
[2:14:06.440 --> 2:14:08.440]  Thank you, Micah
[2:14:08.440 --> 2:14:10.440]  Let's take another call
[2:14:10.440 --> 2:14:12.440]  Todd and Canada, thanks for holding, go ahead
[2:14:12.440 --> 2:14:14.440]  Hello? Alex?
[2:14:14.440 --> 2:14:16.440]  Yes, sir, go ahead
[2:14:16.440 --> 2:14:18.440]  Hi, Alex, I want to thank you very much
[2:14:18.440 --> 2:14:20.440]  For everything you do for the world
[2:14:20.440 --> 2:14:22.440]  Anyway
[2:14:22.440 --> 2:14:24.440]  I had a premonition about four years ago
[2:14:24.440 --> 2:14:26.440]  I'm from Windsor, Ontario
[2:14:26.440 --> 2:14:28.440]  If you know where that is
[2:14:28.440 --> 2:14:30.440]  It's right across the border from Detroit, Michigan
[2:14:30.440 --> 2:14:32.440]  I saw a huge nuclear
[2:14:32.440 --> 2:14:34.440]  explosion over the river
[2:14:34.440 --> 2:14:36.440]  I never thought much about it
[2:14:36.440 --> 2:14:38.440]  Until January
[2:14:38.440 --> 2:14:40.440]  January of this year after
[2:14:40.440 --> 2:14:42.440]  Putin was mounting his troops
[2:14:44.440 --> 2:14:46.440]  It's almost like it's just playing out
[2:14:46.440 --> 2:14:48.440]  in real time
[2:14:48.440 --> 2:14:50.440]  I don't know if there's any way to prevent this
[2:14:52.440 --> 2:14:54.440]  Well, that's right
[2:14:54.440 --> 2:14:56.440]  In Michigan produces a bunch of our weapons
[2:14:56.440 --> 2:14:58.440]  You better believe it's a main target
[2:14:58.440 --> 2:15:00.440]  And I'm half a mile from the river
[2:15:00.440 --> 2:15:02.440]  So I'm vaporized right away
[2:15:04.440 --> 2:15:06.440]  So I was thinking of taking my parents
[2:15:06.440 --> 2:15:08.440]  or elderly and driving up to Northern Ontario
[2:15:08.440 --> 2:15:10.440]  But then I don't know, is it better
[2:15:10.440 --> 2:15:12.440]  just to go right away?
[2:15:12.440 --> 2:15:14.440]  I was about to say that, I'm kind of with you
[2:15:14.440 --> 2:15:16.440]  I'm not suicidal, but
[2:15:16.440 --> 2:15:18.440]  I'm thinking my kids die of radiation poison
[2:15:18.440 --> 2:15:20.440]  I'm kind of like, God, I'm going to stay right here
[2:15:20.440 --> 2:15:22.440]  and vaporize me, you know what I mean?
[2:15:22.440 --> 2:15:24.440]  Yeah, I think
[2:15:24.440 --> 2:15:26.440]  It's a tough call because
[2:15:26.440 --> 2:15:28.440]  You should ask your parents what they want to do
[2:15:28.440 --> 2:15:30.440]  I think your parents are going to vaporize
[2:15:30.440 --> 2:15:32.440]  What do you think?
[2:15:32.440 --> 2:15:34.440]  They already told me
[2:15:34.440 --> 2:15:36.440]  My dad says, just leave us there and take the car
[2:15:36.440 --> 2:15:38.440]  I can't see that
[2:15:38.440 --> 2:15:40.440]  I just can't
[2:15:40.440 --> 2:15:42.440]  Don't leave your folks, stay with them and get vaporized
[2:15:42.440 --> 2:15:44.440]  Stay there, I got a guest
[2:15:44.440 --> 2:15:46.440]  When the guest is gone, I'll come back to you
[2:15:46.440 --> 2:15:48.440]  if you can't understand it
[2:15:48.440 --> 2:15:50.440]  Wow, that's where I'm at, I'm going to stay here
[2:15:50.440 --> 2:15:52.440]  and get vaporized
[2:15:52.440 --> 2:15:54.440]  I'm just going to stay here folks
[2:15:54.440 --> 2:16:16.440]  Look around you, everything I predicted from the Globlestone Documents from their own admissions is now happening
[2:16:16.440 --> 2:16:22.440]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together
[2:16:22.440 --> 2:16:24.440]  I want to ask all of you today
[2:16:24.440 --> 2:16:26.440]  to help keep me on the air
[2:16:26.440 --> 2:16:29.440]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations
[2:16:29.440 --> 2:16:31.440]  but I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court
[2:16:31.440 --> 2:16:33.440]  to pay for 40% of the legal fees
[2:16:33.440 --> 2:16:35.440]  and I can't fund those myself
[2:16:35.440 --> 2:16:37.440]  It's unsustainable
[2:16:37.440 --> 2:16:39.440]  So please, visit
[2:16:39.440 --> 2:16:41.440]  SaveInfoWars.com
[2:16:41.440 --> 2:16:43.440]  SaveInfoWars.com
[2:16:43.440 --> 2:16:45.440]  where you can make straight donations
[2:16:45.440 --> 2:16:47.440]  $5, $10, $50, $100, whatever you can
[2:16:47.440 --> 2:16:49.440]  so that I can continue to persevere
[2:16:49.440 --> 2:16:51.440]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in
[2:16:51.440 --> 2:16:53.440]  but I could give out
[2:16:53.440 --> 2:16:55.440]  Thank you for your support
[2:16:55.440 --> 2:16:57.440]  Wouldn't be without you, SaveInfoWars.com
[2:16:57.440 --> 2:17:02.440]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the Globlestone
[2:17:02.440 --> 2:17:04.440]  I have come from nowhere
[2:17:04.440 --> 2:17:06.440]  to the very heights of politics
[2:17:06.440 --> 2:17:08.440]  not just in America, but in the world
[2:17:08.440 --> 2:17:12.440]  We are engaging the Globlestone at point-blank range
[2:17:12.440 --> 2:17:14.440]  in the information war
[2:17:14.440 --> 2:17:16.440]  but I don't deserve the credit
[2:17:16.440 --> 2:17:18.440]  Yes, I've persevered
[2:17:18.440 --> 2:17:20.440]  but the listeners and viewers
[2:17:20.440 --> 2:17:22.440]  for the real reason you've had the success
[2:17:22.440 --> 2:17:25.440]  We're having now the greatest victories
[2:17:25.440 --> 2:17:28.440]  in the fight against the new order you've ever had
[2:17:28.440 --> 2:17:30.440]  We are now entering the final mile
[2:17:30.440 --> 2:17:32.440]  of the marathon
[2:17:32.440 --> 2:17:34.440]  and that's why today
[2:17:34.440 --> 2:17:36.440]  it's more important than ever
[2:17:36.440 --> 2:17:38.440]  to realize how important you've been in this fight
[2:17:38.440 --> 2:17:40.440]  and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out
[2:17:40.440 --> 2:17:42.440]  and to intensify them
[2:17:42.440 --> 2:17:43.440]  I bless you all
[2:17:43.440 --> 2:17:44.440]  I salute you
[2:17:44.440 --> 2:17:45.440]  I thank you
[2:17:45.440 --> 2:17:46.440]  and I beg you
[2:17:46.440 --> 2:17:48.440]  to intensify what you're doing now
[2:17:48.440 --> 2:17:50.440]  because we are over the target
[2:17:50.440 --> 2:17:52.440]  and this street is happening
[2:17:52.440 --> 2:17:53.440]  The fight is my fight
[2:17:53.440 --> 2:17:54.440]  It's your fight
[2:17:54.440 --> 2:17:55.440]  It's our fight
[2:17:55.440 --> 2:18:16.440]  Flouride is the enemy. It's the bad halogen to the same family as chlorine, bromide, you name it. What's the good halogen?
[2:18:16.440 --> 2:18:26.440]  What's the good halogen to the same family as chlorine?
[2:18:46.440 --> 2:18:59.440]  Look, it's not hype that InfoWars has changed the world
[2:18:59.440 --> 2:19:02.440]  It's not hype that your support of InfoWars
[2:19:02.440 --> 2:19:04.440]  is the reason we were able to do this
[2:19:04.440 --> 2:19:06.440]  So I salute you and I thank you
[2:19:06.440 --> 2:19:09.440]  Now you know about fluoride, the bad halogen on the periodic table
[2:19:09.440 --> 2:19:12.440]  Well, high quality iodine is the good halogen
[2:19:12.440 --> 2:19:14.440]  and does the opposite of fluoride
[2:19:14.440 --> 2:19:16.440]  It doesn't just supercharge your cells
[2:19:16.440 --> 2:19:17.440]  It doesn't just give you more energy
[2:19:17.440 --> 2:19:18.440]  It doesn't just boost your immune system
[2:19:18.440 --> 2:19:24.440]  but it also blocks the bad halogens in the fluoride, chlorine, bromide, bromine family
[2:19:24.440 --> 2:19:29.440]  So ladies and gentlemen, it takes about two weeks for X3 to kick in on average
[2:19:29.440 --> 2:19:30.440]  Take a few drops every day
[2:19:30.440 --> 2:19:33.440]  and almost everyone has dramatic results
[2:19:33.440 --> 2:19:34.440]  Plus it funds the InfoWars
[2:19:34.440 --> 2:19:38.440]  So what do you have to lose but taking action?

[2:20:24.440 --> 2:20:49.440]  I've been reading his writings for many years
[2:20:49.440 --> 2:20:51.440]  and he's with us now, Jeff Nyquist
[2:20:51.440 --> 2:20:54.440]  He's the author of Oranges of the Fourth World War
[2:20:54.440 --> 2:20:57.440]  He writes for a lot of big publications like the APOC Times
[2:20:57.440 --> 2:21:04.440]  and more JR Nyquist blog, JRnyquist.com
[2:21:04.440 --> 2:21:06.440]  and he joins us for the next 45 minutes
[2:21:06.440 --> 2:21:10.440]  to lay out the waterfront of geopolitically what is currently happening
[2:21:10.440 --> 2:21:12.440]  Meanwhile, this is breaking
[2:21:12.440 --> 2:21:16.440]  As we told you days ago, massive Russian troops in Belarus
[2:21:16.440 --> 2:21:18.440]  massing on the border that's right up by Kiev
[2:21:18.440 --> 2:21:21.440]  So not just an invasion from the east into the west
[2:21:21.440 --> 2:21:25.440]  but now major invasion developments
[2:21:25.440 --> 2:21:27.440]  We're going to get his take on that
[2:21:27.440 --> 2:21:29.440]  Jeff Nyquist, thank you for joining us
[2:21:29.440 --> 2:21:31.440]  Thanks for having me, Alex
[2:21:31.440 --> 2:21:32.440]  You're really a leading expert
[2:21:32.440 --> 2:21:34.440]  I really respect your research
[2:21:34.440 --> 2:21:36.440]  Where would you like to start?
[2:21:36.440 --> 2:21:38.440]  Well, there's some disturbing points here
[2:21:38.440 --> 2:21:41.440]  that I, you know, when I heard the news yesterday
[2:21:41.440 --> 2:21:45.440]  that the Russian troops were moving into Belarus
[2:21:45.440 --> 2:21:48.440]  I realized that there were these other markers
[2:21:48.440 --> 2:21:51.440]  For example, on the 23rd of September
[2:21:51.440 --> 2:21:55.440]  the Polish Interior Ministry admitted that they were distributing
[2:21:55.440 --> 2:21:59.440]  potassium iodide tablets to their fire departments
[2:21:59.440 --> 2:22:01.440]  and emergency services
[2:22:01.440 --> 2:22:04.440]  Finland has done similar things
[2:22:04.440 --> 2:22:06.440]  Then you go to Biden's remarks
[2:22:06.440 --> 2:22:11.440]  Now, always watch people who have access to intelligence
[2:22:11.440 --> 2:22:13.440]  and how they regard it
[2:22:13.440 --> 2:22:17.440]  And Biden made a statement that was, I think, very significant
[2:22:17.440 --> 2:22:21.440]  He said that because the Russian forces
[2:22:21.440 --> 2:22:26.440]  had suffered failures on the conventional war level
[2:22:26.440 --> 2:22:28.440]  the danger that they would revert to using
[2:22:28.440 --> 2:22:31.440]  tactical nuclear weapons was serious
[2:22:31.440 --> 2:22:33.440]  And then we go last week to the remarks
[2:22:33.440 --> 2:22:36.440]  that President Zelensky of Ukraine made
[2:22:36.440 --> 2:22:38.440]  to a group in Australia
[2:22:38.440 --> 2:22:41.440]  You remember it created a little bit of stir last week
[2:22:41.440 --> 2:22:45.440]  He talked about if Russia is going to do nuclear strikes
[2:22:45.440 --> 2:22:49.440]  that there needs to be preventive or preemptive strikes
[2:22:49.440 --> 2:22:50.440]  on those nukes
[2:22:50.440 --> 2:22:53.440]  And then he said this is something that should be discussed
[2:22:53.440 --> 2:22:56.440]  and everybody was kind of taken aback
[2:22:56.440 --> 2:22:58.440]  What is he talking about?
[2:22:58.440 --> 2:23:00.440]  The BBC reached out to Zelensky
[2:23:00.440 --> 2:23:02.440]  and on Friday they did an interview
[2:23:02.440 --> 2:23:04.440]  that they published with him
[2:23:04.440 --> 2:23:06.440]  trying to get him to walk it back
[2:23:06.440 --> 2:23:08.440]  But what you really have to do
[2:23:08.440 --> 2:23:10.440]  when you watch this interview with Zelensky
[2:23:10.440 --> 2:23:12.440]  and his face is demeanor
[2:23:12.440 --> 2:23:17.440]  This is a guy who has received very, very frightening news
[2:23:17.440 --> 2:23:19.440]  and it's about nuclear weapons
[2:23:19.440 --> 2:23:21.440]  and he can't talk about it
[2:23:21.440 --> 2:23:24.440]  No, I agree. He looks like he's dying in the interview
[2:23:24.440 --> 2:23:27.440]  He doesn't look like the arrogant Zelensky of months ago
[2:23:27.440 --> 2:23:29.440]  Yeah, this is very...
[2:23:29.440 --> 2:23:31.440]  I've never seen a national leader with this demeanor
[2:23:31.440 --> 2:23:33.440]  and he's a man who, you know, as we watch him
[2:23:33.440 --> 2:23:35.440]  he's a famous comedian
[2:23:35.440 --> 2:23:38.440]  because he has this great ability to express emotions
[2:23:38.440 --> 2:23:40.440]  in his face
[2:23:40.440 --> 2:23:42.440]  and there is no poker face here
[2:23:42.440 --> 2:23:44.440]  and now you have...
[2:23:44.440 --> 2:23:46.440]  the other data point is Poland
[2:23:46.440 --> 2:23:48.440]  back when the war started in the first few days
[2:23:48.440 --> 2:23:50.440]  Poland had told its nationals
[2:23:50.440 --> 2:23:52.440]  to advise them to leave Belarus
[2:23:52.440 --> 2:23:55.440]  Well, in September they advised them again
[2:23:55.440 --> 2:23:57.440]  and again, you know, on the 10th
[2:23:57.440 --> 2:24:00.440]  the day before the Russian troops moved into Belarus
[2:24:00.440 --> 2:24:03.440]  this increase of the warning
[2:24:03.440 --> 2:24:05.440]  increase of the alarm and the urgency
[2:24:05.440 --> 2:24:09.440]  with the potassium, I died together with Zelensky's face
[2:24:09.440 --> 2:24:12.440]  looking like death warmed over
[2:24:12.440 --> 2:24:14.440]  and the president's remarks
[2:24:14.440 --> 2:24:17.440]  we have to realize that
[2:24:17.440 --> 2:24:20.440]  there must be intelligence showing the Russians
[2:24:20.440 --> 2:24:23.440]  are about to use tactical nuclear weapons
[2:24:23.440 --> 2:24:26.440]  the Russians, their artillery offensive was stopped
[2:24:26.440 --> 2:24:29.440]  by the Hamars, their tank offensive was stopped
[2:24:29.440 --> 2:24:32.440]  in the winter, late winter
[2:24:32.440 --> 2:24:35.440]  by the anti-tank rockets
[2:24:35.440 --> 2:24:38.440]  that hand-held rockets that were given to the Ukrainians
[2:24:38.440 --> 2:24:41.440]  and now it's their air force and missiles
[2:24:41.440 --> 2:24:45.440]  and tactical nukes or maybe thermobaric warheads
[2:24:45.440 --> 2:24:48.440]  that can only make the breakthrough for their ground forces
[2:24:48.440 --> 2:24:51.440]  because their ground forces aren't better trained now
[2:24:51.440 --> 2:24:55.440]  and better led than they were in February, March, April
[2:24:55.440 --> 2:24:57.440]  and that's why the former head of NATO
[2:24:57.440 --> 2:24:59.440]  is warned of Putin using nuclear weapons
[2:24:59.440 --> 2:25:02.440]  because under Russian doctrine when they're losing
[2:25:02.440 --> 2:25:04.440]  that's the next step
[2:25:04.440 --> 2:25:06.440]  Yeah, you know the first thing that Putin did
[2:25:06.440 --> 2:25:08.440]  when he came to power in 2000
[2:25:08.440 --> 2:25:10.440]  I think it was like the first or second week
[2:25:10.440 --> 2:25:13.440]  he changed Russia's nuclear doctrine
[2:25:13.440 --> 2:25:16.440]  and he changed it to say that when Russia itself is threatened
[2:25:16.440 --> 2:25:18.440]  when its territory is threatened
[2:25:18.440 --> 2:25:21.440]  first use of nukes is the doctrine
[2:25:21.440 --> 2:25:23.440]  now you remember what happened
[2:25:23.440 --> 2:25:25.440]  the Russians just annexed
[2:25:25.440 --> 2:25:29.440]  before southeastern oblasts of Ukraine
[2:25:29.440 --> 2:25:33.440]  and now they're considered by Moscow Russian territory
[2:25:33.440 --> 2:25:37.440]  so because of this he can then activate that doctrine
[2:25:37.440 --> 2:25:40.440]  legally under Russian law
[2:25:40.440 --> 2:25:44.440]  Explain that, any attack on that is an attack on the Russian homeland
[2:25:44.440 --> 2:25:46.440]  Well, that would be correct
[2:25:46.440 --> 2:25:50.440]  because now Zaporizhia, Kersen, Luhansk and Donetsk
[2:25:50.440 --> 2:25:56.440]  are now considered by Moscow Russian soil
[2:25:56.440 --> 2:25:59.440]  How do you see this unfolding?
[2:25:59.440 --> 2:26:04.440]  Well, the fact that the Russians are moving troops into Belarus
[2:26:04.440 --> 2:26:06.440]  and we know they've been preparing
[2:26:06.440 --> 2:26:08.440]  you know this is some analysts have been telling me
[2:26:08.440 --> 2:26:11.440]  that they've been expecting this move
[2:26:11.440 --> 2:26:14.440]  for two, three months now
[2:26:14.440 --> 2:26:18.440]  because there's been evidence, intelligence that civilians can see
[2:26:18.440 --> 2:26:22.440]  that Russia is preparing to renew its double-envelopment attack
[2:26:22.440 --> 2:26:24.440]  which remember the initial attack
[2:26:24.440 --> 2:26:27.440]  they attacked towards the south, towards Odessa
[2:26:27.440 --> 2:26:29.440]  at the same time they were attacking down on Kiev
[2:26:29.440 --> 2:26:33.440]  that is they were trying an encirclement of Ukraine
[2:26:33.440 --> 2:26:35.440]  to cut it off from the west
[2:26:35.440 --> 2:26:38.440]  to take its capital to decapitate its leadership
[2:26:38.440 --> 2:26:42.440]  that attack failed back in late winter
[2:26:42.440 --> 2:26:45.440]  and really a lot of experts didn't expect it to fail
[2:26:45.440 --> 2:26:48.440]  Ukrainian resistance was much stronger than people expected
[2:26:48.440 --> 2:26:51.440]  now it looks like they're going to renew the attack
[2:26:51.440 --> 2:26:53.440]  but there has to be a difference
[2:26:53.440 --> 2:26:56.440]  they can't possibly expect to succeed
[2:26:56.440 --> 2:27:01.440]  unless they're going to use either large numbers of tactical nuclear weapons
[2:27:01.440 --> 2:27:03.440]  or a thermobaric weapon
[2:27:03.440 --> 2:27:05.440]  some new kind of ordinance
[2:27:05.440 --> 2:27:07.440]  and massing in Belarus means
[2:27:07.440 --> 2:27:09.440]  they're not going to do encirclement now
[2:27:09.440 --> 2:27:11.440]  they're going to try for the capital
[2:27:11.440 --> 2:27:15.440]  of Stalin taking over Berlin in 1945
[2:27:15.440 --> 2:27:17.440]  there are massing troops there
[2:27:17.440 --> 2:27:21.440]  and of course for those who don't know Kiev is like 60 miles or so
[2:27:21.440 --> 2:27:23.440]  from the Belarus border
[2:27:23.440 --> 2:27:25.440]  this is going to be a main city invasion
[2:27:25.440 --> 2:27:27.440]  is that where you see this going?
[2:27:27.440 --> 2:27:29.440]  well no
[2:27:29.440 --> 2:27:34.440]  in military terms flanking is the whole idea
[2:27:34.440 --> 2:27:37.440]  you get behind somebody see like
[2:27:37.440 --> 2:27:41.440]  you know in hand-to-hand combat if someone's behind you
[2:27:41.440 --> 2:27:44.440]  you're in danger because our eyes are on the front
[2:27:44.440 --> 2:27:46.440]  and we can't see the danger
[2:27:46.440 --> 2:27:49.440]  we might hear it but we are not defensible from behind
[2:27:49.440 --> 2:27:54.440]  now armies and countries have the same problem for different reasons
[2:27:54.440 --> 2:27:58.440]  because their supply lines, their logistics are behind them
[2:27:58.440 --> 2:28:01.440]  you get an army behind your front
[2:28:01.440 --> 2:28:03.440]  they're disrupting your case
[2:28:03.440 --> 2:28:05.440]  well is that what you're talking about? it's a pincer attack
[2:28:05.440 --> 2:28:07.440]  the Russians are in the east, they're in the south
[2:28:07.440 --> 2:28:09.440]  now they're coming from the north
[2:28:09.440 --> 2:28:11.440]  right they're going to be
[2:28:11.440 --> 2:28:13.440]  and there's a lot of evidence they've got something planned
[2:28:13.440 --> 2:28:15.440]  in the Black Sea
[2:28:15.440 --> 2:28:17.440]  and the Ukrainians a lot of the Ukrainian moves in the south
[2:28:17.440 --> 2:28:19.440]  were I think to forestall this
[2:28:19.440 --> 2:28:22.440]  and they really the Ukrainians really concentrated on this
[2:28:22.440 --> 2:28:24.440]  in late summer
[2:28:24.440 --> 2:28:26.440]  but the Ukrainians have pushed their attack
[2:28:26.440 --> 2:28:29.440]  in what may strategically be the wrong direction
[2:28:29.440 --> 2:28:31.440]  in the east and the Russians may be fine with that
[2:28:31.440 --> 2:28:34.440]  because the Russians are still thinking of a flanking attack
[2:28:34.440 --> 2:28:36.440]  the most famous flanking battle
[2:28:36.440 --> 2:28:38.440]  double envelopment they call it
[2:28:38.440 --> 2:28:41.440]  was the Battle of Cana in the Second Punic War
[2:28:41.440 --> 2:28:42.440]  where Hannibal
[2:28:42.440 --> 2:28:44.440]  stay right there and we also know
[2:28:44.440 --> 2:28:46.440]  that's where Napoleon lost the Battle of Waterloo
[2:28:46.440 --> 2:28:48.440]  we're going to lay this out folks
[2:28:48.440 --> 2:28:50.440]  is what he's saying is dead on
[2:28:50.440 --> 2:28:52.440]  Jeff Nyquist is our guest
[2:28:52.440 --> 2:28:54.440]  the Russians have been massing troops in the north
[2:28:54.440 --> 2:28:56.440]  while they've got Ukraine distracted in the south
[2:28:56.440 --> 2:28:59.440]  I don't promote things unless they really work
[2:28:59.440 --> 2:29:02.440]  when it comes to politics or culture
[2:29:02.440 --> 2:29:05.440]  or economics we're always the cutting edge to the spirit
[2:29:05.440 --> 2:29:08.440]  and when we talk about the products at infomerstore.com

[2:32:27.440 --> 2:32:30.440]  we are now entering the final mile

[2:32:40.440 --> 2:32:41.440]  and to intensify them
[2:32:41.440 --> 2:32:42.440]  God bless you all
[2:32:42.440 --> 2:32:43.440]  I salute you
[2:32:43.440 --> 2:32:44.440]  I thank you
[2:32:44.440 --> 2:32:45.440]  and I beg you
[2:32:45.440 --> 2:32:47.440]  to intensify what you're doing now
[2:32:47.440 --> 2:32:49.440]  because we are over the target

[2:32:54.440 --> 2:33:20.440]  God bless you all
[2:33:25.440 --> 2:33:28.440]  to me it doesn't matter who started it
[2:33:28.440 --> 2:33:30.440]  who's right or wrong
[2:33:30.440 --> 2:33:32.440]  what matters is if you look at the doctrine of nature
[2:33:32.440 --> 2:33:33.440]  of the United States and Russia
[2:33:33.440 --> 2:33:35.440]  this is going to nuclear war
[2:33:35.440 --> 2:33:37.440]  that's why Biden said Armageddon's here
[2:33:37.440 --> 2:33:40.440]  that's why the Russians said this isn't a joke
[2:33:40.440 --> 2:33:41.440]  and the more Putin loses
[2:33:41.440 --> 2:33:43.440]  the more he's going to double down
[2:33:43.440 --> 2:33:45.440]  Europe's having its energy cut off
[2:33:45.440 --> 2:33:47.440]  the Globals are cutting off our energy
[2:33:47.440 --> 2:33:49.440]  we're being put into a global crisis
[2:33:49.440 --> 2:33:52.440]  the likes of which this planet has never seen
[2:33:52.440 --> 2:33:54.440]  highly respected geopolitical analysts
[2:33:54.440 --> 2:33:56.440]  and author and journalist Jeff Nyquist
[2:33:56.440 --> 2:33:58.440]  is our guest rights for epic times
[2:33:58.440 --> 2:33:59.440]  and so many other great publications
[2:33:59.440 --> 2:34:00.440]  like WorldNet Daily
[2:34:00.440 --> 2:34:02.440]  he's with us here and he's explaining
[2:34:02.440 --> 2:34:04.440]  that the Russians have mobilized
[2:34:04.440 --> 2:34:06.440]  in fact the Ukrainians thought the way
[2:34:06.440 --> 2:34:08.440]  an attack would come from the north at first
[2:34:08.440 --> 2:34:09.440]  but it hasn't
[2:34:09.440 --> 2:34:10.440]  but now it looks like the main Russian force
[2:34:10.440 --> 2:34:12.440]  not just the reserves
[2:34:12.440 --> 2:34:14.440]  and less trained units
[2:34:14.440 --> 2:34:16.440]  that were put into the east
[2:34:16.440 --> 2:34:18.440]  that that was almost a distraction
[2:34:18.440 --> 2:34:19.440]  for what's about to happen
[2:34:19.440 --> 2:34:20.440]  so Jeff I'm going to try to shut up here
[2:34:20.440 --> 2:34:21.440]  and give you the Florida
[2:34:21.440 --> 2:34:23.440]  break down how historical this is
[2:34:23.440 --> 2:34:25.440]  and how dangerous this is
[2:34:25.440 --> 2:34:26.440]  yeah I just
[2:34:26.440 --> 2:34:28.440]  I'm going to do this illustration for us
[2:34:28.440 --> 2:34:31.440]  imagine a front line that runs straight like this
[2:34:31.440 --> 2:34:33.440]  on one side is the Ukrainians
[2:34:33.440 --> 2:34:34.440]  one side is the Russians
[2:34:34.440 --> 2:34:37.440]  you start to Ukrainians advance
[2:34:37.440 --> 2:34:39.440]  to the east in the middle
[2:34:39.440 --> 2:34:41.440]  and notice what happens to the flanks
[2:34:41.440 --> 2:34:42.440]  of the Ukrainians
[2:34:42.440 --> 2:34:44.440]  then if the Russians attack
[2:34:44.440 --> 2:34:46.440]  they can make a circle
[2:34:46.440 --> 2:34:48.440]  now in the battle of Cana
[2:34:48.440 --> 2:34:49.440]  as I was saying before the break
[2:34:49.440 --> 2:34:52.440]  this was one of the most famous battles in history
[2:34:52.440 --> 2:34:55.440]  and military strategists have been trying
[2:34:55.440 --> 2:34:57.440]  and generals and heads of general staff
[2:34:57.440 --> 2:35:00.440]  have been trying to imitate Hannibal
[2:35:00.440 --> 2:35:01.440]  in this battle of Cana
[2:35:01.440 --> 2:35:04.440]  what happened is you had two Roman consular armies
[2:35:04.440 --> 2:35:06.440]  60,000 men
[2:35:06.440 --> 2:35:11.440]  they attacked 50,000 troops under Hannibal
[2:35:11.440 --> 2:35:12.440]  at Cana
[2:35:12.440 --> 2:35:15.440]  and they just plowed right into them
[2:35:15.440 --> 2:35:18.440]  and they let them come right in the center
[2:35:18.440 --> 2:35:19.440]  they just fell back in the center
[2:35:19.440 --> 2:35:21.440]  and then they just started doing circle
[2:35:21.440 --> 2:35:24.440]  until they had the Romans completely surrounded
[2:35:24.440 --> 2:35:25.440]  and then they pressed them
[2:35:25.440 --> 2:35:27.440]  and the Romans were pressed so tight
[2:35:27.440 --> 2:35:29.440]  they couldn't even raise their sword arms
[2:35:29.440 --> 2:35:30.440]  they were pressed against each other
[2:35:30.440 --> 2:35:35.440]  60,000 Romans were cut down in one afternoon, one day
[2:35:35.440 --> 2:35:37.440]  you imagine that kind of loss
[2:35:37.440 --> 2:35:40.440]  when the population of the world was so much less
[2:35:40.440 --> 2:35:41.440]  and Rome was a city
[2:35:41.440 --> 2:35:43.440]  not a giant continent-sized country
[2:35:43.440 --> 2:35:45.440]  it was a massive disaster
[2:35:45.440 --> 2:35:47.440]  comparable in the slaughter too
[2:35:47.440 --> 2:35:48.440]  with the British suffered
[2:35:48.440 --> 2:35:50.440]  at the first day of the Battle of the Somme
[2:35:50.440 --> 2:35:52.440]  and this is the kind of strategy
[2:35:52.440 --> 2:35:55.440]  the Russians are applying to Ukraine
[2:35:55.440 --> 2:35:57.440]  they tried it in the end of winter
[2:35:57.440 --> 2:35:59.440]  and now they're recasting it
[2:35:59.440 --> 2:36:01.440]  and it's impossible to imagine
[2:36:01.440 --> 2:36:03.440]  how they would expect to do it
[2:36:03.440 --> 2:36:05.440]  without the use of some special weaponry
[2:36:05.440 --> 2:36:07.440]  nuclear weaponry especially
[2:36:07.440 --> 2:36:08.440]  and we're getting these hints
[2:36:08.440 --> 2:36:11.440]  as I said from President Biden
[2:36:11.440 --> 2:36:13.440]  and explained they heard them all together
[2:36:13.440 --> 2:36:14.440]  like a fish in a barrel
[2:36:14.440 --> 2:36:15.440]  then they've got to use
[2:36:15.440 --> 2:36:17.440]  because they don't have the same targeting the West does
[2:36:17.440 --> 2:36:18.440]  but they do have nuclear weapons
[2:36:18.440 --> 2:36:20.440]  they've got to use really devastating weapons
[2:36:20.440 --> 2:36:23.440]  to make those forces capitulate
[2:36:23.440 --> 2:36:25.440]  well it's the devastating weapons to make the breakthrough
[2:36:25.440 --> 2:36:26.440]  because Ukraine
[2:36:26.440 --> 2:36:28.440]  as this they tried to encircle Ukraine
[2:36:28.440 --> 2:36:30.440]  they're going to try to cut south from Belorussia
[2:36:30.440 --> 2:36:33.440]  to cut the supply lines from the West
[2:36:33.440 --> 2:36:35.440]  to cut off the tracks and the roads
[2:36:35.440 --> 2:36:38.440]  and to cut off Kiev from the rest of the world
[2:36:38.440 --> 2:36:40.440]  storming a city is not a good idea
[2:36:40.440 --> 2:36:42.440]  I mean it's a horrible thought
[2:36:42.440 --> 2:36:45.440]  but you could use a thermobaric bombardment on Kiev
[2:36:45.440 --> 2:36:47.440]  nuclear bombardment of Kiev in Lviv
[2:36:47.440 --> 2:36:49.440]  which are the main transit hubs
[2:36:49.440 --> 2:36:52.440]  and the main cities in the western
[2:36:52.440 --> 2:36:54.440]  and west-central Ukraine
[2:36:54.440 --> 2:36:57.440]  that would be that are basically supporting the war
[2:36:57.440 --> 2:36:59.440]  and then if you can come up from the south
[2:36:59.440 --> 2:37:01.440]  the Russians do have amphibious forces
[2:37:01.440 --> 2:37:03.440]  and they have a fleet in the Black Sea
[2:37:03.440 --> 2:37:06.440]  and they could try to then re-establish a position
[2:37:06.440 --> 2:37:08.440]  amphibious landing around Odessa
[2:37:08.440 --> 2:37:11.440]  and try to then reactivate that southern push
[2:37:11.440 --> 2:37:14.440]  so they have the southern pits are coming from the south
[2:37:14.440 --> 2:37:16.440]  the northern one from Belorussia
[2:37:16.440 --> 2:37:19.440]  if they can connect behind Kiev
[2:37:19.440 --> 2:37:21.440]  in western Ukraine if they can connect
[2:37:21.440 --> 2:37:23.440]  that will doom the Ukrainian forces
[2:37:23.440 --> 2:37:27.440]  because it's almost like cutting off a person's airway
[2:37:27.440 --> 2:37:30.440]  unless Ukraine receives a constant supply
[2:37:30.440 --> 2:37:32.440]  from the western part of the country
[2:37:32.440 --> 2:37:34.440]  and from NATO
[2:37:34.440 --> 2:37:36.440]  unless they have those supplies
[2:37:36.440 --> 2:37:38.440]  coming to their front-line units
[2:37:38.440 --> 2:37:41.440]  they will begin to run out of fuel, run out of ammunition
[2:37:41.440 --> 2:37:44.440]  and their morale will take a hit
[2:37:44.440 --> 2:37:46.440]  Well how does it feed in here though
[2:37:46.440 --> 2:37:48.440]  that I mean from most analysis I've seen
[2:37:48.440 --> 2:37:50.440]  and I tend to agree with that
[2:37:50.440 --> 2:37:53.440]  the Russians, things aren't going as well as the Russians thought
[2:37:53.440 --> 2:37:55.440]  fighting western high-tech weapons
[2:37:55.440 --> 2:37:57.440]  are you saying this is always part of the plan
[2:37:57.440 --> 2:37:59.440]  or when do you think Russia is going to invade
[2:37:59.440 --> 2:38:01.440]  from the north or
[2:38:01.440 --> 2:38:04.440]  Well, you know, most of the Ukrainian weapons
[2:38:04.440 --> 2:38:06.440]  are Soviet-era weapons
[2:38:06.440 --> 2:38:09.440]  the Ukrainian army is largely, its brigades are armed
[2:38:09.440 --> 2:38:11.440]  like the Russian units are armed
[2:38:11.440 --> 2:38:13.440]  the difference is the training
[2:38:13.440 --> 2:38:18.440]  the Ukrainians after the war started in Donetsk
[2:38:18.440 --> 2:38:21.440]  back in 2014
[2:38:21.440 --> 2:38:24.440]  the Ukrainians said look, the first couple of battles
[2:38:24.440 --> 2:38:26.440]  the Ukrainians really suffered heavy casualties
[2:38:26.440 --> 2:38:28.440]  they actually suffered the first battle
[2:38:28.440 --> 2:38:31.440]  larger battle in Donbas
[2:38:31.440 --> 2:38:34.440]  the Ukrainians suffered a double-envelopment
[2:38:34.440 --> 2:38:36.440]  their forces were annihilated
[2:38:36.440 --> 2:38:38.440]  and the Russians tried to repeat that
[2:38:38.440 --> 2:38:40.440]  in another battle
[2:38:40.440 --> 2:38:42.440]  and the Ukrainian forces slipped away
[2:38:42.440 --> 2:38:44.440]  the Ukrainians are used to seeing the Russians
[2:38:44.440 --> 2:38:46.440]  make this maneuver
[2:38:46.440 --> 2:38:48.440]  and so the Ukrainians have positioned reserves
[2:38:48.440 --> 2:38:50.440]  and they are watching for this
[2:38:50.440 --> 2:38:52.440]  and what happened in February when this happened
[2:38:52.440 --> 2:38:55.440]  the Ukrainians were quickly able to bring up brigades
[2:38:55.440 --> 2:38:57.440]  and protect Kiev's flank
[2:38:57.440 --> 2:38:59.440]  and the Russians were out paratroopers
[2:38:59.440 --> 2:39:01.440]  if you recall right behind Kiev
[2:39:01.440 --> 2:39:03.440]  to make the encirclement
[2:39:03.440 --> 2:39:06.440]  after Kiev and to decapitate the government
[2:39:06.440 --> 2:39:07.440]  that failed
[2:39:07.440 --> 2:39:10.440]  that assault attempted to encircle Kiev
[2:39:10.440 --> 2:39:11.440]  failed
[2:39:11.440 --> 2:39:14.440]  now a much broader encirclement is probably what they will do
[2:39:14.440 --> 2:39:17.440]  not going after a city if they need to take a city out
[2:39:17.440 --> 2:39:20.440]  again, the terrible thought that a nuclear weapon would be used
[2:39:20.440 --> 2:39:22.440]  and of course the Russians now
[2:39:22.440 --> 2:39:25.440]  you will notice that they are justifying these things
[2:39:25.440 --> 2:39:28.440]  by the attack on their infrastructure
[2:39:28.440 --> 2:39:30.440]  the Nord Stream Pipeline
[2:39:30.440 --> 2:39:32.440]  and the attack on the Kyrgyz Strait Bridge
[2:39:32.440 --> 2:39:34.440]  and they can say look
[2:39:34.440 --> 2:39:36.440]  we are under attack
[2:39:36.440 --> 2:39:38.440]  we need to do this, we need to respond
[2:39:38.440 --> 2:39:40.440]  and they have threatened
[2:39:40.440 --> 2:39:43.440]  attack on the Kyrgyz Strait Bridge was a red line for the Russians
[2:39:43.440 --> 2:39:45.440]  so what does a nuclear weapon do
[2:39:45.440 --> 2:39:48.440]  because it turns the whole world against Russia at that point
[2:39:48.440 --> 2:39:50.440]  well
[2:39:50.440 --> 2:39:53.440]  the world may be turned against Russia now
[2:39:53.440 --> 2:39:54.440]  already
[2:39:54.440 --> 2:39:56.440]  so what have they got to lose
[2:39:56.440 --> 2:39:58.440]  it seems that Mr. Putin
[2:39:58.440 --> 2:40:00.440]  and the Kremlin
[2:40:00.440 --> 2:40:02.440]  do not have a reverse gear here
[2:40:02.440 --> 2:40:04.440]  it's only to go into higher gear
[2:40:04.440 --> 2:40:06.440]  I mean people have made this observation
[2:40:06.440 --> 2:40:08.440]  I mean you would think that
[2:40:08.440 --> 2:40:11.440]  Mr. Putin would want to concede something
[2:40:11.440 --> 2:40:13.440]  but instead he just ups the ante
[2:40:13.440 --> 2:40:15.440]  by annexing the four territories
[2:40:15.440 --> 2:40:18.440]  in fact the Ukrainian reaction to the annexation
[2:40:18.440 --> 2:40:20.440]  was to pass a law
[2:40:20.440 --> 2:40:23.440]  making it illegal for any Ukrainian politician
[2:40:23.440 --> 2:40:25.440]  to negotiate away that territory
[2:40:25.440 --> 2:40:28.440]  the Ukrainians are fighting to get it all back
[2:40:28.440 --> 2:40:30.440]  the Ukrainians are fighting to keep it all
[2:40:30.440 --> 2:40:32.440]  and to go further I think
[2:40:32.440 --> 2:40:34.440]  this is something that foreign minister
[2:40:34.440 --> 2:40:36.440]  Sergei Lavrov has said
[2:40:36.440 --> 2:40:38.440]  is that well you know if they resist us
[2:40:38.440 --> 2:40:40.440]  we'll take the whole country
[2:40:40.440 --> 2:40:41.440]  basically
[2:40:41.440 --> 2:40:43.440]  and this was by the way when
[2:40:43.440 --> 2:40:45.440]  Putin made his initial speech
[2:40:45.440 --> 2:40:47.440]  before the invasion began in February
[2:40:47.440 --> 2:40:49.440]  he said Ukraine is not a real country
[2:40:49.440 --> 2:40:51.440]  and basically saying
[2:40:51.440 --> 2:40:53.440]  it is part of Russia
[2:40:53.440 --> 2:40:55.440]  so what's the time tables you have Nykos?
[2:40:55.440 --> 2:40:58.440]  well it's if Russian troops
[2:40:58.440 --> 2:41:01.440]  are just crossing into Belarus now
[2:41:01.440 --> 2:41:03.440]  it's going to take them a while
[2:41:03.440 --> 2:41:05.440]  to fully deploy into the country
[2:41:05.440 --> 2:41:06.440]  and to get ready
[2:41:06.440 --> 2:41:08.440]  and of course if they want to wait
[2:41:08.440 --> 2:41:10.440]  till the ground freezes they may have to wait
[2:41:10.440 --> 2:41:11.440]  till November
[2:41:11.440 --> 2:41:13.440]  but of course if a nuclear bombardment
[2:41:13.440 --> 2:41:15.440]  is in the cards that could take place
[2:41:15.440 --> 2:41:17.440]  at any time
[2:41:17.440 --> 2:41:19.440]  my guess is
[2:41:19.440 --> 2:41:21.440]  knowing Soviet military doctrine
[2:41:21.440 --> 2:41:23.440]  which is inherited from the Russian Federation
[2:41:23.440 --> 2:41:25.440]  the nuclear strikes
[2:41:25.440 --> 2:41:27.440]  and the actual invasion of the forces
[2:41:27.440 --> 2:41:29.440]  have to come close together
[2:41:29.440 --> 2:41:31.440]  so my guess is
[2:41:31.440 --> 2:41:33.440]  three, four, five weeks
[2:41:33.440 --> 2:41:35.440]  away perhaps
[2:41:35.440 --> 2:41:37.440]  I would be surprised if nuclear strikes
[2:41:37.440 --> 2:41:39.440]  occurred immediately
[2:41:39.440 --> 2:41:41.440]  within a week or two
[2:41:41.440 --> 2:41:43.440]  but anything is possible it's hard to predict
[2:41:43.440 --> 2:41:45.440]  I agree and Henry Kissinger is not a good guy
[2:41:45.440 --> 2:41:47.440]  but even Henry Kissinger and the Pope
[2:41:47.440 --> 2:41:49.440]  are saying we should have a peace deal
[2:41:49.440 --> 2:41:51.440]  that shows you even old line globalists
[2:41:51.440 --> 2:41:53.440]  are concerned
[2:41:53.440 --> 2:41:55.440]  well Kissinger made it
[2:41:55.440 --> 2:41:57.440]  Kissinger is a political scientist
[2:41:57.440 --> 2:41:59.440]  he has a lot of education
[2:41:59.440 --> 2:42:01.440]  Kissinger made a statement which I agree with
[2:42:01.440 --> 2:42:03.440]  which is very important to keep in mind
[2:42:03.440 --> 2:42:05.440]  he made this statement back in March
[2:42:05.440 --> 2:42:07.440]  he said look
[2:42:07.440 --> 2:42:09.440]  the whole western military systems
[2:42:09.440 --> 2:42:11.440]  and political systems based on the idea
[2:42:11.440 --> 2:42:13.440]  of deterrence
[2:42:13.440 --> 2:42:15.440]  we talk all kinds of ways
[2:42:15.440 --> 2:42:17.440]  to deterrence
[2:42:17.440 --> 2:42:19.440]  well mad is an older form
[2:42:19.440 --> 2:42:21.440]  of deterrence from the 1960s
[2:42:21.440 --> 2:42:23.440]  but to deter an attack
[2:42:23.440 --> 2:42:25.440]  you make your counterattack terrible enough
[2:42:25.440 --> 2:42:27.440]  so that the enemy can't get any advantage from it
[2:42:27.440 --> 2:42:29.440]  so
[2:42:29.440 --> 2:42:31.440]  but what Kissinger said is he said
[2:42:31.440 --> 2:42:33.440]  we have had no discussion
[2:42:33.440 --> 2:42:35.440]  our strategists, our leaders have never had
[2:42:35.440 --> 2:42:37.440]  the discussion what if deterrence
[2:42:37.440 --> 2:42:39.440]  fails
[2:42:39.440 --> 2:42:41.440]  and the danger here is that
[2:42:41.440 --> 2:42:43.440]  we haven't thought it through, we haven't discussed it
[2:42:43.440 --> 2:42:45.440]  and we will not know what to do
[2:42:45.440 --> 2:42:47.440]  and we have a president that literally
[2:42:47.440 --> 2:42:49.440]  doesn't know what planet he's on
[2:42:49.440 --> 2:42:51.440]  Jeff Nyquist, our guest straight ahead
[2:42:51.440 --> 2:42:53.440]  on the verge of nuclear war, stay with us
[2:42:55.440 --> 2:42:57.440]  it's our best seller
[2:42:57.440 --> 2:42:59.440]  we first came out with it five years ago
[2:42:59.440 --> 2:43:01.440]  and it was a moderate seller
[2:43:01.440 --> 2:43:03.440]  but as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion
[2:43:03.440 --> 2:43:05.440]  and experienced
[2:43:05.440 --> 2:43:07.440]  the way it made him feel
[2:43:07.440 --> 2:43:09.440]  and how healthy it made him
[2:43:09.440 --> 2:43:11.440]  it has become our number one overall best seller
[2:43:11.440 --> 2:43:13.440]  and it's been sold out for a while but it's finally back in stock
[2:43:13.440 --> 2:43:15.440]  vitamin mineral fusion
[2:43:15.440 --> 2:43:17.440]  it doesn't just supercharge your immune system
[2:43:17.440 --> 2:43:19.440]  but it helps every
[2:43:19.440 --> 2:43:21.440]  cellular function of the body
[2:43:21.440 --> 2:43:23.440]  it has all the minerals, all the key amino acids
[2:43:23.440 --> 2:43:25.440]  all of the essential vitamins
[2:43:25.440 --> 2:43:27.440]  that you need to live and be healthy
[2:43:27.440 --> 2:43:29.440]  essential means without these things
[2:43:29.440 --> 2:43:31.440]  you die
[2:43:31.440 --> 2:43:33.440]  and so much of the food is debased
[2:43:33.440 --> 2:43:35.440]  there's so many chemicals in the environment
[2:43:35.440 --> 2:43:37.440]  it is critical to bolster our body's defenses
[2:43:37.440 --> 2:43:39.440]  with a product like this
[2:43:39.440 --> 2:43:41.440]  now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there
[2:43:41.440 --> 2:43:43.440]  but this is amongst the very best
[2:43:43.440 --> 2:43:45.440]  it's at a low price and it funds the impover
[2:43:45.440 --> 2:43:47.440]  so the only way you lose is not taking action today
[2:43:47.440 --> 2:43:49.440]  getting vitamin mineral fusion
[2:43:49.440 --> 2:43:51.440]  finally back in stock at infoworkstore.com

[2:43:57.440 --> 2:43:59.440]  I have been in a 28-year
[2:43:59.440 --> 2:44:01.440]  marathon battle with a globalist
[2:44:01.440 --> 2:44:03.440]  I have come from
[2:44:03.440 --> 2:44:05.440]  nowhere
[2:44:05.440 --> 2:44:07.440]  to the very heights of politics not just in America
[2:44:07.440 --> 2:44:09.440]  but the world
[2:44:09.440 --> 2:44:11.440]  we are engaging the globalist
[2:44:11.440 --> 2:44:13.440]  point-blank range in the information war
[2:44:13.440 --> 2:44:15.440]  but I don't deserve the credit
[2:44:15.440 --> 2:44:17.440]  yes I've persevered
[2:44:17.440 --> 2:44:19.440]  but the listeners and viewers who support
[2:44:19.440 --> 2:44:21.440]  them for wars are the real reason
[2:44:21.440 --> 2:44:23.440]  you have the success
[2:44:23.440 --> 2:44:25.440]  we're having now the greatest victories
[2:44:25.440 --> 2:44:27.440]  in the fight against the new order
[2:44:27.440 --> 2:44:29.440]  you've ever had
[2:44:29.440 --> 2:44:31.440]  we are now entering the final mile
[2:44:31.440 --> 2:44:33.440]  of the marathon
[2:44:33.440 --> 2:44:35.440]  and that's why today it's more important
[2:44:35.440 --> 2:44:37.440]  than ever to realize how important you've been
[2:44:37.440 --> 2:44:39.440]  in this fight and to continue
[2:44:39.440 --> 2:44:41.440]  the efforts you've been carrying out
[2:44:41.440 --> 2:44:43.440]  and to intensify it
[2:44:43.440 --> 2:44:45.440]  God bless you all
[2:44:45.440 --> 2:44:47.440]  I salute you, I thank you
[2:44:47.440 --> 2:44:49.440]  and I beg you to intensify what you're doing now
[2:44:49.440 --> 2:44:51.440]  because we are over the target
[2:44:51.440 --> 2:44:53.440]  and this is happening
[2:44:53.440 --> 2:44:55.440]  the fight is my fight, it's your fight
[2:44:55.440 --> 2:44:57.440]  it's our fight, God bless you all
[2:44:57.440 --> 2:44:59.440]  look it's not hype that info wars
[2:44:59.440 --> 2:45:01.440]  has changed the world
[2:45:01.440 --> 2:45:03.440]  it's not hype that your support of info wars
[2:45:03.440 --> 2:45:05.440]  is the reason we were able to do this
[2:45:05.440 --> 2:45:07.440]  so I salute you and I thank you
[2:45:07.440 --> 2:45:09.440]  for taking part in this video
[2:45:09.440 --> 2:45:11.440]  this is a video about the bad halogen
[2:45:11.440 --> 2:45:13.440]  on the periodic table
[2:45:13.440 --> 2:45:15.440]  well, high quality iodine is the good halogen
[2:45:15.440 --> 2:45:17.440]  and does the opposite of fluoride
[2:45:17.440 --> 2:45:19.440]  and when you've got it in your body
[2:45:19.440 --> 2:45:21.440]  it doesn't just super charge your cells
[2:45:21.440 --> 2:45:23.440]  it doesn't just give you more energy
[2:45:23.440 --> 2:45:25.440]  it doesn't just boost your immune system
[2:45:25.440 --> 2:45:27.440]  but it also blocks the bad halogens
[2:45:27.440 --> 2:45:29.440]  in the fluoride, chlorine, bromide, bromine family
[2:45:29.440 --> 2:45:31.440]  so ladies and gentlemen
[2:45:31.440 --> 2:45:33.440]  it takes about two weeks, four x3
[2:45:33.440 --> 2:45:35.440]  to kick in on average
[2:45:35.440 --> 2:45:39.560]  What do you have to lose but taking action?
[2:45:39.560 --> 2:45:47.000]  Experience X3, finally back in stock at infowarstore.com right now for 50% off.

[2:45:56.760 --> 2:45:58.600]  Look around you.
[2:45:58.600 --> 2:46:02.120]  Everything I predicted from the Globalistone documents from their own admissions is now
[2:46:02.120 --> 2:46:03.120]  happening.
[2:46:03.120 --> 2:46:05.000]  Infowars credibility.
[2:46:05.000 --> 2:46:09.440]  My credibility has never been higher and it's because of your backing of this operation
[2:46:09.440 --> 2:46:15.280]  that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits
[2:46:15.280 --> 2:46:16.280]  stay on air.
[2:46:16.280 --> 2:46:21.320]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[2:46:21.320 --> 2:46:26.600]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[2:46:26.600 --> 2:46:30.480]  In my decades on air I've never asked for personal donations but I'm being forced by
[2:46:30.480 --> 2:46:36.040]  the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself.
[2:46:36.040 --> 2:46:37.040]  It's unsustainable.
[2:46:37.040 --> 2:46:45.520]  So please, visit saveinfowarstore.com, saveinfowarstore.com where you can make straight donations, $5,
[2:46:45.520 --> 2:46:49.560]  $10, $500, whatever you can so that I can continue to persevere.
[2:46:49.560 --> 2:46:50.560]  I'll never give up.
[2:46:50.560 --> 2:46:51.560]  I'll never give in.
[2:46:51.560 --> 2:46:52.560]  But I could give out.
[2:46:52.560 --> 2:46:54.080]  Thank you for your support.
[2:46:54.080 --> 2:46:55.080]  Wouldn't be without you.
[2:46:55.080 --> 2:47:02.880]  Saveinfowarstore.com, leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[2:47:02.880 --> 2:47:26.120]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:47:26.120 --> 2:47:29.120]  Well I'm really impressed over the years reading Jeff Nyquist's work.
[2:47:29.120 --> 2:47:32.920]  I hope he'll come back again soon to join us for a full hour, hell, maybe a commercial
[2:47:32.920 --> 2:47:33.920]  free tonight.
[2:47:33.920 --> 2:47:34.920]  We're going to midnight.
[2:47:34.920 --> 2:47:40.600]  But his analysis is dead on and we are in grave danger right now.
[2:47:40.600 --> 2:47:45.640]  You know, I noticed starting last week our great iodine product X3 was selling out.
[2:47:45.640 --> 2:47:46.640]  I didn't raise the price of it.
[2:47:46.640 --> 2:47:47.640]  I kept it 50% off.
[2:47:47.640 --> 2:47:54.480]  In fact, during this crisis of promo code 17761776 at checkout, it's 60% off.
[2:47:54.480 --> 2:47:56.680]  We'll sell out probably in a week at current sales rates.
[2:47:56.680 --> 2:47:59.920]  It's not going to protect you from nuclear war, waking up and praying to God and repenting
[2:47:59.920 --> 2:48:02.480]  and a peace deal will do that.
[2:48:02.480 --> 2:48:06.040]  A few isotopes that protects your thyroid during a nuclear war, but not for the main
[2:48:06.040 --> 2:48:07.040]  war.
[2:48:07.040 --> 2:48:09.680]  You're going to die from the starvation, the power outages, all the rest of it.
[2:48:09.680 --> 2:48:11.000]  We don't sell it because of that.
[2:48:11.000 --> 2:48:14.680]  We sell it because of what it does for energy in your immune system, your stamina, your
[2:48:14.680 --> 2:48:15.680]  veto.
[2:48:15.680 --> 2:48:20.880]  This is the best all three good types of iodine in one, 50% off at infowarstore.com.

[2:48:34.920 --> 2:48:37.640]  being going to discount on the signed book or unsigned book.
[2:48:37.640 --> 2:48:42.680]  Also a promo code 1776 and we're going to go until midnight tonight, got a bunch of big
[2:48:42.680 --> 2:48:49.000]  special guests joining us, but going back to Jeff Nyquist, here's the 7.5 billion person
[2:48:49.000 --> 2:48:50.000]  question.
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:54.840]  They always say the billion dollar question or the 67 trillion dollar question with inflation.
[2:48:54.840 --> 2:49:01.520]  But no, this is the 7.5 billion person question, is how do we avert this when it's clearly
[2:49:01.520 --> 2:49:04.360]  escalating towards Armageddon?
[2:49:04.360 --> 2:49:11.400]  Well, it's up to Moscow what they do next.
[2:49:11.400 --> 2:49:15.040]  They can escalate and continue the war or not.
[2:49:15.040 --> 2:49:19.960]  I don't think the Ukrainians, it's emotional with them, they're not going to change their
[2:49:19.960 --> 2:49:20.960]  position.
[2:49:20.960 --> 2:49:23.840]  The West can't tell Ukraine what to do in this circumstance.
[2:49:23.840 --> 2:49:25.920]  They could withdraw support.
[2:49:25.920 --> 2:49:32.560]  I don't think there's a political wherewithal on the West to do it because, again, the sympathy
[2:49:32.560 --> 2:49:41.840]  in Europe for Ukraine and the fear of Russia is partly driving this from the European end.
[2:49:41.840 --> 2:49:47.560]  Of course, the other aspect, the elephant in the room that we haven't discussed is China
[2:49:47.560 --> 2:49:52.120]  and North Korea, both nuclear powers.
[2:49:52.120 --> 2:49:59.280]  They just didn't exercise, North Korea practicing loading nuclear weapons onto their missiles.
[2:49:59.280 --> 2:50:01.640]  China has been in this mobilization.
[2:50:01.640 --> 2:50:07.400]  We had the 57 minute meeting, smuggled out military civil meeting in Guangdong, smuggled
[2:50:07.400 --> 2:50:14.960]  out by people, many of who have been murdered since, about transforming China from normal
[2:50:14.960 --> 2:50:15.960]  to war.
[2:50:15.960 --> 2:50:20.680]  China is undergoing a mobilization, transforming ships, getting ships ready.
[2:50:20.680 --> 2:50:23.280]  There's tanks in the Chinese ports.
[2:50:23.280 --> 2:50:28.960]  It looks like China is ready to join a widened war.
[2:50:28.960 --> 2:50:34.120]  This is really frightening because I don't think Russia would be pushing this if they
[2:50:34.120 --> 2:50:36.880]  didn't have China behind them.
[2:50:36.880 --> 2:50:44.800]  In fact, Putin and Xi Jinping met on February 4th in Beijing just before the Beijing Olympics,
[2:50:44.800 --> 2:50:48.480]  on the day the Beijing Olympics started, before this invasion.
[2:50:48.480 --> 2:50:54.480]  I think President Xi of China gave the go ahead, gave Russia permission to do this,
[2:50:54.480 --> 2:50:59.200]  and then they met again in Samarkand a couple of weeks back, and again, we see these mobilizations.
[2:50:59.200 --> 2:51:00.200]  That's right.
[2:51:00.200 --> 2:51:01.840]  First time Xi Jinping's left in two years.
[2:51:01.840 --> 2:51:03.280]  He goes to meet with Putin.
[2:51:03.280 --> 2:51:04.280]  Yeah.
[2:51:04.280 --> 2:51:10.200]  And of course, right after this meeting, Putin announces this mobilization, this large mobilization,
[2:51:10.200 --> 2:51:15.200]  which by the way, is larger than the state of 300,000 reports out of Russia, and many
[2:51:15.200 --> 2:51:20.560]  experts are saying, look, this could be 1.3, 1.2 million men they've tried to mobilize.
[2:51:20.560 --> 2:51:26.080]  And however many Russians have fled the border or whatever, I think the Russian defense minister
[2:51:26.080 --> 2:51:30.640]  is correct when he says, well, we have 25 million men of military age in Russia.
[2:51:30.640 --> 2:51:36.360]  So they have a vast number of men they could call upon.
[2:51:36.360 --> 2:51:41.480]  The problem that Russia has, though, is that people don't really want to fight.
[2:51:41.480 --> 2:51:48.280]  And so they're trying to motivate them, and the propaganda's turned up, and they, okay,
[2:51:48.280 --> 2:51:51.480]  they call up 1.2 million men.
[2:51:51.480 --> 2:51:52.480]  They only get 600,000.
[2:51:52.480 --> 2:51:57.920]  Still, it's a lot of men, and it allows them to equip new armies, and we just don't have
[2:51:57.920 --> 2:52:02.760]  any idea how much equipment the Russians have built, what they're sitting on, whether they've
[2:52:02.760 --> 2:52:06.520]  even committed their best weapons yet.
[2:52:06.520 --> 2:52:08.040]  So there's a lot of unknowns.
[2:52:08.040 --> 2:52:13.760]  And of course, their best weapons really are their hypersonic missiles, their nuclear warheads.
[2:52:13.760 --> 2:52:17.560]  That's where they've really put all their eggs in that basket.
[2:52:17.560 --> 2:52:22.280]  Nuclear war is the kind of war where suddenly the playing field becomes level.
[2:52:22.280 --> 2:52:27.680]  And the West, imagine if they used nuclear weapons here in Ukraine to finish the war.
[2:52:27.680 --> 2:52:30.400]  What would happen to the markets in the West?
[2:52:30.400 --> 2:52:31.400]  Would they cave in?
[2:52:31.400 --> 2:52:32.400]  Would we have massive panic here?
[2:52:32.400 --> 2:52:36.160]  I think that, I think if one new goes off, we have a global depression.
[2:52:36.160 --> 2:52:39.280]  I mean, let's talk about that, Jeff Nyquist.
[2:52:39.280 --> 2:52:41.040]  What does a limited nuclear war look like?
[2:52:41.040 --> 2:52:44.520]  In most analysis shows, it would quickly get out of hand.
[2:52:44.520 --> 2:52:48.040]  Yeah, a lot of people, well, that's like war.
[2:52:48.040 --> 2:52:53.240]  Once you do a war, you're stepping across a barrier psychologically and also in terms
[2:52:53.240 --> 2:52:57.120]  of action, in which one thing leads to another, and you're not in control.
[2:52:57.120 --> 2:53:01.840]  The idea that people control events, it's easy to control events when you wake up every
[2:53:01.840 --> 2:53:04.520]  morning and you have your coffee and you go to the same job.
[2:53:04.520 --> 2:53:09.680]  But when suddenly everything is changing and very violent, you lose control very easily.
[2:53:09.680 --> 2:53:10.680]  I agree.
[2:53:10.680 --> 2:53:11.680]  Let's talk about the politics inside Russia.
[2:53:11.680 --> 2:53:13.680]  Do you think it's accurate?
[2:53:13.680 --> 2:53:17.200]  There's a lot of heat on Putin to be more hardline?
[2:53:17.200 --> 2:53:20.040]  There's heat from the hardliners.
[2:53:20.040 --> 2:53:21.040]  Definitely there is.
[2:53:21.040 --> 2:53:27.880]  There is also trepidation by many people in Russia because they're afraid that this is
[2:53:27.880 --> 2:53:32.720]  going to become nuclear and they're afraid that their sons are going to go forward and
[2:53:32.720 --> 2:53:34.360]  become part of the casualties.
[2:53:34.360 --> 2:53:36.880]  I think it's true.
[2:53:36.880 --> 2:53:43.480]  Russia probably has suffered 60,000 battlefield deaths and 50,000 to 60,000 missing and wounded
[2:53:43.480 --> 2:53:45.080]  and prisoners.
[2:53:45.080 --> 2:53:46.320]  This is tremendous casualty.
[2:53:46.320 --> 2:53:51.880]  If the initial invasion force was between 180,000 and 200,000, that's almost a third
[2:53:51.880 --> 2:53:52.880]  of 2,000.
[2:53:52.880 --> 2:53:56.760]  You're creating and stupidly make fun of the dead bodies and have pigs eating Russian
[2:53:56.760 --> 2:53:57.920]  dead soldiers.
[2:53:57.920 --> 2:54:00.600]  That's not getting them points in Russia.
[2:54:00.600 --> 2:54:03.480]  Well, Russia likes to put this propaganda on.
[2:54:03.480 --> 2:54:10.080]  Both sides, Ukraine and Russia, are going to depict the other side.
[2:54:10.080 --> 2:54:14.320]  You could call this a Soviet civil war because both these countries were Soviet republics.
[2:54:14.320 --> 2:54:18.680]  It's like a swabic civil war.
[2:54:18.680 --> 2:54:22.640]  Putin is really trying to put the Soviet Union back together again.
[2:54:22.640 --> 2:54:23.800]  Let's be realistic.
[2:54:23.800 --> 2:54:29.800]  When Sergei Shoigu several weeks ago was caught on video saying, first we put the Soviet Union
[2:54:29.800 --> 2:54:37.800]  back and then we have peace, and then you had this social media message by Dmitry Medvedev,
[2:54:37.800 --> 2:54:43.120]  the former president, talking about restoring the borders of the Soviet Union and how Kazakhstan
[2:54:43.120 --> 2:54:48.080]  is massacring Russians and we need to move into Kazakhstan.
[2:54:48.080 --> 2:54:53.080]  Look, Russia's neighbors are getting more and more alarmed at this attempt to re-establish
[2:54:53.080 --> 2:54:56.160]  the empire, so to speak.
[2:54:56.160 --> 2:54:57.880]  Look, everybody in the surrounding country.
[2:54:57.880 --> 2:55:04.960]  You look at how Finland is mobilizing, how Sweden and Finland have joined NATO, how Poland
[2:55:04.960 --> 2:55:10.200]  is reacting to be increasing, to try to make one of the biggest armies in Europe, how they're
[2:55:10.200 --> 2:55:11.400]  reacting in Romania.
[2:55:11.400 --> 2:55:18.560]  The countries that have experienced Russian heel on their neck are the most alarmed.
[2:55:18.560 --> 2:55:24.320]  They do not want to be under the Russian boot and they are mobilizing more than anyone.
[2:55:24.320 --> 2:55:26.560]  I think it's a reflection.
[2:55:26.560 --> 2:55:32.560]  Many in this Germany and France, I've been lukewarm in this whole thing, the big countries
[2:55:32.560 --> 2:55:33.560]  in Europe.
[2:55:33.560 --> 2:55:39.680]  But you look at those countries that have the real neck at stake, they're really worried
[2:55:39.680 --> 2:55:44.480]  and they're really taking steps.
[2:55:44.480 --> 2:55:50.560]  Can we do anything in the West, because when I look at the emblematic weakness of Obama's
[2:55:50.560 --> 2:55:57.240]  Third Administration, Biden, and I just see the average American going about their business
[2:55:57.240 --> 2:56:03.680]  like nothing's happening, it just really adds a little layer to this, kind of the icing
[2:56:03.680 --> 2:56:06.560]  on the cake that spells doom to me.
[2:56:06.560 --> 2:56:09.200]  Well, we have our normalcy bias.
[2:56:09.200 --> 2:56:13.760]  Look, I've said for years, we live in a shopping mall regime and it's all based on economic
[2:56:13.760 --> 2:56:19.080]  optimism because the system depends on a continuous investment in the future.
[2:56:19.080 --> 2:56:25.160]  And if people don't believe those investments are going to pay off, that there is no future
[2:56:25.160 --> 2:56:30.000]  in the economic sense, that we're going to be having a war and a war of tremendous destruction,
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:34.360]  the system is going to economically fail or it's going to change.
[2:56:34.360 --> 2:56:37.720]  And that may be what we're going to confront if this becomes a larger war.
[2:56:37.720 --> 2:56:42.280]  Remember, when World War I started, many of the markets around the world closed until
[2:56:42.280 --> 2:56:43.280]  that war was over.
[2:56:43.280 --> 2:56:44.960]  And the same for World War II.
[2:56:44.960 --> 2:56:50.920]  World War III is going to even be harder on the markets and on investments and anything
[2:56:50.920 --> 2:56:52.880]  that people have money in.
[2:56:52.880 --> 2:56:56.800]  And that's exactly what Klaus Schwab wants is the Great Reset.
[2:56:56.800 --> 2:57:03.560]  Well, it's very interesting because war is one of those things that allows people who
[2:57:03.560 --> 2:57:07.560]  want to create socialism and a new global totalitarian system.
[2:57:07.560 --> 2:57:09.880]  Now, war is the health of the state.
[2:57:09.880 --> 2:57:15.440]  Right, well, the state is, the function of the state is to protect society.
[2:57:15.440 --> 2:57:19.560]  And in that protective function and an extreme emergency, suddenly the people in charge can
[2:57:19.560 --> 2:57:27.000]  use those emergency powers in a way not intended that is just for security, but to build something
[2:57:27.000 --> 2:57:28.000]  new.
[2:57:28.000 --> 2:57:30.600]  And this is always a danger, you know, like George Washington said.
[2:57:30.600 --> 2:57:31.600]  That's right, war is good for tyranny.
[2:57:31.600 --> 2:57:37.280]  Jeff Nyquist, jrnyquist.blog, jrnyquist.com, join us again soon, sir.
[2:57:37.280 --> 2:57:39.600]  Thank you so much and God bless.
[2:57:39.600 --> 2:57:40.600]  Thank you.
[2:57:40.600 --> 2:58:09.600]  Number four straight ahead, I've got your calls and then Jay Dyer.
[2:58:09.600 --> 2:58:25.720]  The name is Jay.
[2:58:25.720 --> 2:58:33.420]  And you know what?
[2:58:33.420 --> 2:58:35.660]  It takes two weeks to kick it on average.
[2:58:35.660 --> 2:58:46.540]  You've got to go to infowarstore.com and get x3, 50% off, x3, 50% off infowarstore.com.
[2:58:46.540 --> 2:58:51.340]  Think about a world without InfoWars.
[2:58:51.340 --> 2:58:55.660]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers
[2:58:55.660 --> 2:59:00.940]  and stories we've broken together, this family that is InfoWars.
[2:59:00.940 --> 2:59:06.260]  Think about how InfoWars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Ball Sonaro and other
[2:59:06.260 --> 2:59:13.820]  foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main
[2:59:13.820 --> 2:59:17.060]  base to defeat the New World Order.
[2:59:17.060 --> 2:59:22.820]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners
[2:59:22.820 --> 2:59:27.300]  of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[2:59:27.300 --> 2:59:29.060]  I don't take the credit.
[2:59:29.060 --> 2:59:30.900]  I give you the credit.
[2:59:30.900 --> 2:59:35.300]  And now InfoWars is facing its darkest hours, it isn't going to give up.
[2:59:35.300 --> 2:59:37.060]  Without your support we can be shut down.
[2:59:37.060 --> 2:59:48.300]  Please go to saveinfowars.com today, saveinfowars.com today and donate for our legal defense fund.
[2:59:48.300 --> 3:00:01.260]  Meeting of Frontal Assault on the Lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:00:01.260 --> 3:00:03.460]  Powerful interview with Jeff Nyquist.
[3:00:03.460 --> 3:00:08.540]  Now I'm going to try to put 10 phone calls in in the next 15 minutes.
[3:00:08.540 --> 3:00:13.420]  So, Todd, we were talking about living across the river from Detroit in Canada in nuclear
[3:00:13.420 --> 3:00:16.820]  war and, you know, want to take care of your parents and everything.
[3:00:16.820 --> 3:00:20.940]  I would just say get right with God and the best thing you can do is just follow the Holy
[3:00:20.940 --> 3:00:21.940]  Spirit.
[3:00:21.940 --> 3:00:22.940]  Closing comments, Todd.
[3:00:22.940 --> 3:00:23.940]  Appreciate you're holding.
[3:00:23.940 --> 3:00:24.940]  Okay.
[3:00:24.940 --> 3:00:25.940]  Thanks, Alex.
[3:00:25.940 --> 3:00:26.940]  Yeah.
[3:00:26.940 --> 3:00:33.220]  I mean, it seems more realistic than maybe to hide out for a little while and suffer
[3:00:33.220 --> 3:00:38.420]  and radiation and starvation or marauding Mad Max games.
[3:00:38.420 --> 3:00:43.220]  I saw in 1983, I was in grade 12, so I'm a little older than you.
[3:00:43.220 --> 3:00:49.860]  I remember seeing the day after and I just watched a clip of it yesterday with my mom
[3:00:49.860 --> 3:00:56.100]  and I can't believe how realistic for 1983, almost 40 years ago and how devastatingly
[3:00:56.100 --> 3:00:58.300]  real it seemed.
[3:00:58.300 --> 3:01:02.180]  I guess that's what's coming upon us.
[3:01:02.180 --> 3:01:04.140]  I agree and I meant to talk about this.
[3:01:04.140 --> 3:01:11.460]  When I come on at 6 p.m. tonight, we're going to be joined by Steve Quayle to talk about
[3:01:11.460 --> 3:01:15.700]  nuclear war and then Robert Barnes is going to join us, but I'm going to cover FEMA camps,
[3:01:15.700 --> 3:01:19.220]  not just here but around the world, under the guise of COVID, we've got a whole report
[3:01:19.220 --> 3:01:20.220]  on it.
[3:01:20.220 --> 3:01:25.140]  We haven't aired yet and I'm also going to get into all the other different facets of
[3:01:25.140 --> 3:01:26.140]  the day after tomorrow.
[3:01:26.140 --> 3:01:31.660]  So, funny you mentioned that, that's coming up tonight when I come back and host at 6 p.m.
[3:01:31.660 --> 3:01:32.660]  Okay.
[3:01:32.660 --> 3:01:33.660]  Thanks, Alex.
[3:01:33.660 --> 3:01:34.660]  Thanks for everything you do.
[3:01:34.660 --> 3:01:40.460]  Pray to God that this goes away some more de-escalates in some manner.
[3:01:40.460 --> 3:01:41.460]  Yes, sir.
[3:01:41.460 --> 3:01:43.660]  I love you, Todd, and we're in this together, brother.
[3:01:43.660 --> 3:01:44.660]  Give your parents my love.
[3:01:44.660 --> 3:01:45.660]  All right.
[3:01:45.660 --> 3:01:46.660]  Let's go to Melissa in Arizona.
[3:01:46.660 --> 3:01:47.660]  Melissa, you're on the air.
[3:01:47.660 --> 3:01:48.660]  Go ahead.
[3:01:48.660 --> 3:01:50.660]  Thank you, Alex, for taking my call.
[3:01:50.660 --> 3:01:54.740]  I just want to let you know that I'm blessed to be able to call in and support you and
[3:01:54.740 --> 3:01:55.740]  your show.
[3:01:55.740 --> 3:01:56.740]  Thank you.
[3:01:56.740 --> 3:01:58.300]  And that you are beautiful inside and out, sir.
[3:01:58.300 --> 3:01:59.300]  Thank you.
[3:01:59.300 --> 3:02:04.460]  I also want to let you know that your show has led to miraculous multiplication.
[3:02:04.460 --> 3:02:08.860]  We have a whole group off of the Getter Chat, Troll Management, Inc.
[3:02:08.860 --> 3:02:12.180]  We have an Odyssey channel under New Free Press.
[3:02:12.180 --> 3:02:16.780]  We have VMS Talk Show who's been on with Owen, and we have a punk group, American Thought
[3:02:16.780 --> 3:02:24.260]  Criminals, that are all fighting in the resistance, and it's all come from your show.
[3:02:24.260 --> 3:02:26.380]  Well, that's all because of you supporting us.
[3:02:26.380 --> 3:02:27.380]  It's all of us together.
[3:02:27.380 --> 3:02:33.980]  So I was calling in today because I wanted to just echo the fact that evil is launching
[3:02:33.980 --> 3:02:40.020]  an attack, and it's not just, you know, at your level anymore, it's coming to us just
[3:02:40.020 --> 3:02:42.700]  as, you know, I'd say just regular people.
[3:02:42.700 --> 3:02:48.020]  I'm looking at an ad that was paid for by the Democrat Party and is addressed to me
[3:02:48.020 --> 3:02:50.660]  as a registered Republican on the front.
[3:02:50.660 --> 3:02:56.500]  Oh, my gosh, my whole family that are Republicans, and we're all getting Democrat text messages
[3:02:56.500 --> 3:02:59.220]  and emails we didn't sign up for.
[3:02:59.220 --> 3:03:00.220]  Absolutely.
[3:03:00.220 --> 3:03:06.540]  It says demonic across the front, I kid you not, Alex, it says in huge letters, demonic,
[3:03:06.540 --> 3:03:09.980]  and there's a picture of a Ouija board under it.
[3:03:09.980 --> 3:03:17.820]  And the whole premise of this ad is it's an anti-Blakemasters who is pro-abortion, and
[3:03:17.820 --> 3:03:24.100]  he recently said abortion is demonic, and instead of, like, countering this argument,
[3:03:24.100 --> 3:03:26.700]  they've doubled down and embraced the people.
[3:03:26.700 --> 3:03:32.620]  Correct, the Satanic groups are in federal court saying, yes, killing babies is our religion.
[3:03:32.620 --> 3:03:38.100]  Absolutely, and they are shoving it in our face, and it's just an affront to Christianity,
[3:03:38.100 --> 3:03:44.420]  to faith, and it's an abomination to God and the lives of the children that have been sacrificed.
[3:03:44.420 --> 3:03:47.980]  Well, here's the good news, here's the good news, Melissa.
[3:03:47.980 --> 3:03:50.380]  Together with God, we force them out in the open.
[3:03:50.380 --> 3:03:54.500]  I mean, they're pro-pedophile, pro-nuclear war, pro-Satanism now.
[3:03:54.500 --> 3:03:56.860]  We have forced them out in the open.
[3:03:56.860 --> 3:04:01.740]  Absolutely, and I think all that we can do is just rebuke this evil, and I just felt
[3:04:01.740 --> 3:04:06.180]  it, that it was on myself that I had to bring this to the light just to let people know
[3:04:06.180 --> 3:04:09.900]  that they're bringing the fight directly to us, to our male box.
[3:04:09.900 --> 3:04:14.500]  Well, so they're sending Republican voters Ouija board Satanism emails.
[3:04:14.500 --> 3:04:20.460]  Yes, I have, no, not an email, I have a flyer, I'm holding this in my hand, and I'm going
[3:04:20.460 --> 3:04:21.460]  to burn it.
[3:04:21.460 --> 3:04:26.740]  I'm going to scan it and message it, excuse me, to ShowTipsandInfoWars.com.
[3:04:26.740 --> 3:04:32.220]  I want to see, I believe you, these people are, they know they're losing, so they're
[3:04:32.220 --> 3:04:37.340]  just decloaking, they're out in the open, God bless you, wow, okay.
[3:04:37.340 --> 3:04:44.420]  Jimmy, Lisa, Brian, Jamie, Nathaniel, we're going to you in 60 seconds, and then Jay Dyer
[3:04:44.420 --> 3:04:49.580]  is always amazing, and then Owen Troyer for three hours, does an incredible job, and then
[3:04:49.580 --> 3:04:53.500]  I'll be back six p.m. tonight with a bunch of big guests, Steve Quayle, Robert Barnes,
[3:04:53.500 --> 3:04:54.980]  a bunch of others tonight.
[3:04:54.980 --> 3:05:02.740]  We've all heard of interventions with a family member or a friend or a co-worker that's
[3:05:02.740 --> 3:05:07.260]  on drugs or alcohol and is in a bad place and they need family and friends to come to
[3:05:07.260 --> 3:05:09.980]  their aid and talk to them and get them into rehab.
[3:05:09.980 --> 3:05:13.580]  Well, it's the same thing for America and the rest of the world.
[3:05:13.580 --> 3:05:18.300]  When it comes to critical vitamins and minerals that your body must have to live and people
[3:05:18.300 --> 3:05:22.260]  don't listen and they don't supplement, it's literally an intervention.
[3:05:22.260 --> 3:05:24.340]  I lead an incredibly stressful life.
[3:05:24.340 --> 3:05:30.740]  I don't play with Mr. Health, but if I wasn't taking products like X3 from InfoWareStore.com,
[3:05:30.740 --> 3:05:34.060]  I could not continue to do what I'm doing today.
[3:05:34.060 --> 3:05:39.220]  The energy, the stamina, the libido, the immune system boost is incredible, and despite the
[3:05:39.220 --> 3:05:45.540]  fact that it's selling out, X3 is 50% off right now exclusively at InfoWareStore.com.
[3:05:45.540 --> 3:05:48.420]  There's a run on iodine happening right now because of the war.
[3:05:48.420 --> 3:05:49.420]  We're not selling it for that.
[3:05:49.420 --> 3:05:52.900]  We're selling it for what it does for your immune system and your focus and clarity.
[3:05:52.900 --> 3:06:18.860]  Get X3 today, 50% off at InfoWareStore.com all supplies left.
[3:06:40.940 --> 3:06:44.780]  You know, I'm really sorry to listeners that we have to be living this time, but we told
[3:06:44.780 --> 3:06:46.620]  you it was coming.
[3:06:46.620 --> 3:06:52.460]  And this is the time that's going to really separate the boys from the men.
[3:06:52.460 --> 3:06:53.980]  The women from the girls.
[3:06:53.980 --> 3:06:59.540]  Going to jam in some final phone calls ahead of Jay Dyer, and as I said, we're going live
[3:06:59.540 --> 3:07:01.540]  until midnight tonight.
[3:07:01.540 --> 3:07:02.540]  This is an emergency broadcast.
[3:07:02.540 --> 3:07:04.540]  We're doing a fundraiser.
[3:07:04.540 --> 3:07:06.140]  God always keeps us honest here.
[3:07:06.140 --> 3:07:08.780]  We're always in the red, the black, back and forth.
[3:07:08.780 --> 3:07:10.900]  We got great products you already need.
[3:07:10.900 --> 3:07:12.340]  Big sales going on right now.
[3:07:12.340 --> 3:07:16.020]  Promo code 1776 is additional 10% off.
[3:07:16.020 --> 3:07:18.020]  The lowest sales, 40% off.
[3:07:18.020 --> 3:07:19.020]  The biggest sell 50.
[3:07:19.020 --> 3:07:24.060]  We've got 60% off with promo code 1776.com on many of the items.
[3:07:24.060 --> 3:07:26.180]  Double patriot points, biggest sell of the year.
[3:07:26.180 --> 3:07:29.660]  We've expanded it all to blow it all out with nuclear war and all this going on.
[3:07:29.660 --> 3:07:34.020]  We've got to have the funds to continue operating until the lights go off or until we avert
[3:07:34.020 --> 3:07:35.020]  this crisis.
[3:07:35.020 --> 3:07:39.140]  But you can feel it in your gut, you can feel it in your bones.
[3:07:39.140 --> 3:07:42.700]  I'd say 30% chance there's a limited nuclear war.
[3:07:42.700 --> 3:07:46.500]  And the problem with that number is, most analysts agree with that number, once you
[3:07:46.500 --> 3:07:52.060]  do that, it escalates full nuclear war to like a 50, 60, 70% chance.
[3:07:52.060 --> 3:07:58.140]  There's only one country dropped nuclear bombs on people, atomic bombs, that's the US.
[3:07:58.140 --> 3:08:03.740]  So I'd be lying to you if I told you that you might want to get ready to kiss your ass
[3:08:03.740 --> 3:08:04.740]  goodbye.
[3:08:04.740 --> 3:08:05.740]  That's okay.
[3:08:05.740 --> 3:08:06.740]  We live forever.
[3:08:06.740 --> 3:08:09.140]  We got souls that are eternal, but I'd be getting right with God right now.
[3:08:09.140 --> 3:08:11.140]  I mean, it's really that simple.
[3:08:11.140 --> 3:08:14.580]  All right, let's go to phone calls, order there received, Jimmy in Ohio.
[3:08:14.580 --> 3:08:16.900]  Jimmy, thanks for holding brother, you're on the air.
[3:08:16.900 --> 3:08:19.180]  How you doing, sir?
[3:08:19.180 --> 3:08:22.580]  I'm completely, I'm completely just freaked out right now.
[3:08:22.580 --> 3:08:24.980]  I mean, well, I get it.
[3:08:24.980 --> 3:08:26.740]  I, uh, I'm first time caller.
[3:08:26.740 --> 3:08:28.740]  I've been listening to you since 2009.
[3:08:28.740 --> 3:08:30.580]  I'm kind of excited to bear with me.
[3:08:30.580 --> 3:08:31.580]  I love you brother.
[3:08:31.580 --> 3:08:32.580]  Good to have you.
[3:08:32.580 --> 3:08:33.580]  Thank you.
[3:08:33.580 --> 3:08:38.380]  You are one of God's warriors, that's for sure.
[3:08:38.380 --> 3:08:43.700]  And I keep, you keep going back to the Star Wars thing and let me tell you, all I keep
[3:08:43.700 --> 3:08:49.700]  seeing is when we win, um, you receive in the metal, like in Star Wars, when they got
[3:08:49.700 --> 3:08:53.780]  the parade and the big parade and everybody's up there, you'll be one of them, uh, General
[3:08:53.780 --> 3:08:55.460]  Flynn, probably another.
[3:08:55.460 --> 3:09:00.780]  Um, but anyway, so to your Star Wars thing, you know, you keep saying, well, you keep
[3:09:00.780 --> 3:09:03.620]  going back to the Star Wars, but think about it.
[3:09:03.620 --> 3:09:07.540]  How did they defeat the Death Star?
[3:09:07.540 --> 3:09:10.580]  They got inside and took down the force field, right?
[3:09:10.580 --> 3:09:11.580]  Yes.
[3:09:11.580 --> 3:09:12.580]  So they could get the planes in.
[3:09:12.580 --> 3:09:15.300]  That's what they're doing here with America, right?
[3:09:15.300 --> 3:09:19.500]  They're, they're taking down our force fields, which is our military, right?
[3:09:19.500 --> 3:09:22.980]  They're depleting the oil, depleting the fuel on the reserves.
[3:09:22.980 --> 3:09:24.300]  They're lowering our defenses.
[3:09:24.300 --> 3:09:25.300]  You're absolutely right.
[3:09:25.300 --> 3:09:26.300]  Yes.
[3:09:26.300 --> 3:09:30.660]  They're, they're flooding the immigrants in with the terrorists and whoever else in
[3:09:30.660 --> 3:09:34.420]  there that they can control or whoever they got control of, right?
[3:09:34.420 --> 3:09:36.900]  I mean, you know, you think it weakened in the money system.
[3:09:36.900 --> 3:09:41.660]  If you think about it, um, you know, the money comes in the, the immigrants come in, they
[3:09:41.660 --> 3:09:45.020]  give them the money, the free money, they turn around and spend it.
[3:09:45.020 --> 3:09:46.180]  Where do they spend it?
[3:09:46.180 --> 3:09:48.180]  Big companies, Amazon, whatever, right?
[3:09:48.180 --> 3:09:54.700]  So, so the money gets laundered right back into the big corporations, right?
[3:09:54.700 --> 3:09:55.700]  And they're so greedy.
[3:09:55.700 --> 3:09:57.460]  They're going to start a nuclear war.
[3:09:57.460 --> 3:09:59.660]  Their money won't be worth anything once that happens.
[3:09:59.660 --> 3:10:00.660]  Yes.
[3:10:00.660 --> 3:10:04.780]  Well, and that's the other thing I wanted to touch, touch on about is, is to reaffirm
[3:10:04.780 --> 3:10:06.780]  your thing about God.
[3:10:06.780 --> 3:10:07.780]  God is amazing.
[3:10:07.780 --> 3:10:14.260]  So you just do for him and give yourself to him, you can get superpowers literally like
[3:10:14.260 --> 3:10:16.980]  I've slowed down time to save a dog.
[3:10:16.980 --> 3:10:23.660]  I mean, I've found dead bodies like my mama, tiny little woman stopped a car with two kids
[3:10:23.660 --> 3:10:29.780]  and me and my cousin when we were little rolling down a hill with super strength.
[3:10:29.780 --> 3:10:32.020]  And that's the story of like the gin, right?
[3:10:32.020 --> 3:10:33.020]  The genie.
[3:10:33.020 --> 3:10:36.780]  You get the three wishes, but there's always a side effect, right?
[3:10:36.780 --> 3:10:39.380]  There's always a negative because that's how the devil works, right?
[3:10:39.380 --> 3:10:40.580]  He wants something in return.
[3:10:40.580 --> 3:10:45.380]  When you just give yourself over to God, God gives you that power, but he's only going
[3:10:45.380 --> 3:10:51.260]  to give it the power to the people that are true and he knows who's true by their heart.
[3:10:51.260 --> 3:10:52.260]  Powerful story.
[3:10:52.260 --> 3:10:53.260]  God bless you, Jimmy.
[3:10:53.260 --> 3:10:54.260]  Nathaniel in Alabama.
[3:10:54.260 --> 3:10:55.260]  Go ahead.
[3:10:55.260 --> 3:10:56.260]  Thanks for calling.
[3:10:56.260 --> 3:10:57.260]  Hey, Alex.
[3:10:57.260 --> 3:11:00.020]  The wild dream come true.
[3:11:00.020 --> 3:11:05.900]  So I'm a prior Marine recently got out because of the vaccine issue.
[3:11:05.900 --> 3:11:10.780]  And I am I rate right now because I just found out that one of my buddies, he submitted
[3:11:10.780 --> 3:11:14.740]  a religious exemption just like I did.
[3:11:14.740 --> 3:11:19.940]  And they told him basically it was taken so long that they told him, well, you have to
[3:11:19.940 --> 3:11:23.500]  get it or we're going to take you out of the unit and you're going to even though a month
[3:11:23.500 --> 3:11:25.620]  ago they said no more shots free of the military.
[3:11:25.620 --> 3:11:27.860]  They're still doing exactly.
[3:11:27.860 --> 3:11:33.380]  So he just so he capitulated sometime last year and got it because they were going to
[3:11:33.380 --> 3:11:35.060]  take him out of his unit.
[3:11:35.060 --> 3:11:39.580]  And he just got his religious exemption back last week, excepted.
[3:11:39.580 --> 3:11:40.580]  That's right.
[3:11:40.580 --> 3:11:43.660]  They know it's outside law what they're doing.
[3:11:43.660 --> 3:11:47.780]  So they buffalo people into being conned into this.
[3:11:47.780 --> 3:11:54.020]  I know so many people who were threatened with things that were illegal to do and they were
[3:11:54.020 --> 3:11:59.180]  forced to get this this injection and I'm I'm on fire about it.
[3:11:59.180 --> 3:12:03.340]  Hey, one control of our bodies, brother, and I'm sorry that happened to your friend.
[3:12:03.340 --> 3:12:05.740]  So I have a separate issue.
[3:12:05.740 --> 3:12:11.700]  I grew up as a Catholic and as a conspiracy theorist, listen to my mom.
[3:12:11.700 --> 3:12:16.180]  She watched your show with me growing up out, telling some of my middle school parents
[3:12:16.180 --> 3:12:21.700]  about harp and all that sort of stuff when I was in middle school.
[3:12:21.700 --> 3:12:26.820]  And it took me a while to get to trust your show because I was like, well, why would they
[3:12:26.820 --> 3:12:28.700]  allow him to stay on air?
[3:12:28.700 --> 3:12:32.980]  But because of all the attacks that you went through, I realized I mean, you got to be the
[3:12:32.980 --> 3:12:33.980]  real deal.
[3:12:33.980 --> 3:12:35.940]  Well, brother, I don't I wonder why I'm still on there.
[3:12:35.940 --> 3:12:36.940]  It's God.
[3:12:36.940 --> 3:12:37.940]  Evil's not all powerful.
[3:12:37.940 --> 3:12:40.340]  And they've really tried to destroy us.
[3:12:40.340 --> 3:12:41.340]  They know they kill us.
[3:12:41.340 --> 3:12:42.340]  It makes us smarter.
[3:12:42.340 --> 3:12:43.340]  I appreciate your call.
[3:12:43.340 --> 3:12:47.260]  In fact, I meant to get to one of the most important Gregory's reports ever.
[3:12:47.260 --> 3:12:49.500]  He filed a day at Bandai video.
[3:12:49.500 --> 3:12:55.420]  When I come back tonight, we're going to play weather weaponization and hurricane in it is
[3:12:55.420 --> 3:12:58.100]  extremely important and all admitted.
[3:12:58.100 --> 3:12:59.460]  So look for that tonight.
[3:12:59.460 --> 3:13:02.020]  Thank you so much, sir, Lisa in Rhode Island.
[3:13:02.020 --> 3:13:03.020]  You're on the air.
[3:13:03.020 --> 3:13:04.020]  Go ahead.
[3:13:04.020 --> 3:13:05.020]  Hi, Lisa.
[3:13:05.020 --> 3:13:06.020]  Welcome.
[3:13:06.020 --> 3:13:07.020]  How are you?
[3:13:07.020 --> 3:13:08.020]  I'm good.
[3:13:08.020 --> 3:13:09.020]  Go ahead.
[3:13:09.020 --> 3:13:21.020]  I like to not talk about the war or, you know, the nuclear bombs that are going to take
[3:13:21.020 --> 3:13:22.020]  off.
[3:13:22.020 --> 3:13:23.020]  Yes, ma'am.
[3:13:23.020 --> 3:13:24.020]  You're on the air.
[3:13:24.020 --> 3:13:25.020]  Give us your take on it.
[3:13:25.020 --> 3:13:33.700]  As far as I'm concerned, at this point, we're in a lot of trouble with what, you know, the
[3:13:33.700 --> 3:13:38.020]  people in control are doing, but I don't even want to discuss that.
[3:13:38.020 --> 3:13:46.660]  I wanted to call and say thank you for saving my life and the rest of my family, my children,
[3:13:46.660 --> 3:13:54.980]  my grandchildren, which is the information that you put out for a lot of products.
[3:13:54.980 --> 3:13:55.980]  Got your book.
[3:13:55.980 --> 3:13:56.980]  Thank you.
[3:13:56.980 --> 3:13:57.980]  Thank you.
[3:13:57.980 --> 3:13:58.980]  It was fantastic.
[3:13:58.980 --> 3:14:10.180]  And just all the Rhode Island and Massachusetts depots, get on Alex Jones and start, you know,
[3:14:10.180 --> 3:14:12.660]  buying the products because they're well worth it.
[3:14:12.660 --> 3:14:16.940]  Well, I just appreciate you putting up with my begging all day because we don't have all
[3:14:16.940 --> 3:14:18.980]  the sexual money they say we got when maxed out.
[3:14:18.980 --> 3:14:21.940]  And I love the criminal of the war where most important works about to happen.
[3:14:21.940 --> 3:14:24.660]  So I thank you for your family support.
[3:14:24.660 --> 3:14:32.900]  Alex, I'm watching the whole showcase in Connecticut and it's insanity.
[3:14:32.900 --> 3:14:36.500]  And let me tell you something.
[3:14:36.500 --> 3:14:40.660]  You're a true hero and you really saved the lives of me and my family.
[3:14:40.660 --> 3:14:41.660]  Well, I appreciate you.
[3:14:41.660 --> 3:14:46.180]  You know, we've not talked about the Texas Secretary of State attacking me and all this
[3:14:46.180 --> 3:14:48.060]  stuff saying I should be arrested.
[3:14:48.060 --> 3:14:49.060]  It's because I'm not worried about that.
[3:14:49.060 --> 3:14:50.380]  I'm worried about nuclear war.
[3:14:50.380 --> 3:14:52.660]  But yeah, we were the real deal, folks.
[3:14:52.660 --> 3:14:53.660]  There's real people.
[3:14:53.660 --> 3:14:54.660]  There's not just evil.
[3:14:54.660 --> 3:14:55.660]  You're real.
[3:14:55.660 --> 3:14:56.660]  You're listeners.
[3:14:56.660 --> 3:14:57.660]  You're real.
[3:14:57.660 --> 3:14:58.660]  You know you're real.
[3:14:58.660 --> 3:14:59.660]  I'm real, too.
[3:14:59.660 --> 3:15:00.660]  I'm 100% real, folks.
[3:15:00.660 --> 3:15:01.660]  And I love you and I appreciate you.
[3:15:01.660 --> 3:15:02.660]  And thank you so much, Lisa.

[3:15:06.180 --> 3:15:07.180]  I'll call you back tonight.
[3:15:07.180 --> 3:15:12.460]  I'm going to be hosting like six to midnight with Owen Schreuer, a bunch of big guests.
[3:15:12.460 --> 3:15:14.500]  Jay Dyer is about to take over.
[3:15:14.500 --> 3:15:15.660]  Thank you all for your support.
[3:15:15.660 --> 3:15:18.740]  I hate to come to you and ask for support, but we won't be here if you don't support.

[3:15:46.420 --> 3:15:48.140]  Please magnify the broadcast.
[3:15:48.140 --> 3:15:49.140]  You are the power.
[3:15:49.140 --> 3:15:50.940]  You're the reason we're successful.
[3:15:50.940 --> 3:15:51.940]  Share the links tonight.
[3:15:51.940 --> 3:15:53.860]  Tell folks to get into this emergency broadcast.
[3:15:53.860 --> 3:16:02.540]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the Globals.
[3:16:02.540 --> 3:16:08.860]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the
[3:16:08.860 --> 3:16:09.860]  world.
[3:16:09.860 --> 3:16:14.580]  We are engaging the Globals at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't
[3:16:14.580 --> 3:16:15.580]  deserve the credit.
[3:16:15.580 --> 3:16:20.540]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support NM4 Wars are the real
[3:16:20.540 --> 3:16:23.100]  reason you've had the success.
[3:16:23.100 --> 3:16:27.500]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order you've ever
[3:16:27.500 --> 3:16:28.500]  had.
[3:16:28.500 --> 3:16:35.220]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon, and that's why today it's more important
[3:16:35.220 --> 3:16:39.180]  than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the
[3:16:39.180 --> 3:16:42.020]  efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify them.
[3:16:42.020 --> 3:16:43.020]  God bless you all.
[3:16:43.020 --> 3:16:44.020]  I salute you.
[3:16:44.020 --> 3:16:45.020]  I thank you.
[3:16:45.020 --> 3:16:50.020]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and this
[3:16:50.020 --> 3:16:51.020]  streak is happening.
[3:16:51.020 --> 3:16:52.020]  The fight is my fight.
[3:16:52.020 --> 3:16:53.020]  It's your fight.
[3:16:53.020 --> 3:16:54.020]  It's our fight.
[3:16:54.020 --> 3:16:56.580]  God bless you all.
[3:16:56.580 --> 3:17:01.380]  Think about a world without NM4 Wars.
[3:17:01.380 --> 3:17:05.700]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers
[3:17:05.700 --> 3:17:11.020]  and stories we've broken together, this family that is NM4 Wars.
[3:17:11.020 --> 3:17:16.340]  Think about how NM4 Wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other
[3:17:16.340 --> 3:17:23.900]  foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main
[3:17:23.900 --> 3:17:27.100]  base to defeat the New World Order.
[3:17:27.100 --> 3:17:32.860]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners
[3:17:32.860 --> 3:17:37.340]  of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[3:17:37.340 --> 3:17:39.100]  I don't take the credit.
[3:17:39.100 --> 3:17:40.940]  I give you the credit.
[3:17:40.940 --> 3:17:43.300]  And now NM4 Wars is facing its darkest hours.
[3:17:43.300 --> 3:17:45.300]  It isn't going to give up.
[3:17:45.300 --> 3:17:47.060]  Without your support, we can be shut down.

[3:17:57.220 --> 3:17:58.980]  Fluoride is the enemy.
[3:17:58.980 --> 3:18:04.460]  It's the bad halogen to the same family as chlorine, bromide, you name it.
[3:18:04.460 --> 3:18:06.180]  What's the good halogen?
[3:18:06.180 --> 3:18:08.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is iodine.

[3:19:50.420 --> 3:19:51.580]  Don't wait.
[3:19:51.580 --> 3:19:52.580]  You'll be impressed.
[3:19:52.580 --> 3:20:22.420]  All right, Jay Dyer was set to host, but they just handed me a note during the break and
[3:20:22.420 --> 3:20:27.660]  it is verdict will be read in about two minutes.
[3:20:27.660 --> 3:20:30.140]  So that's from my lawyer, Norm Pattis.
[3:20:30.140 --> 3:20:31.140]  It's being announced.
[3:20:31.140 --> 3:20:33.740]  They had a total show trial.
[3:20:33.740 --> 3:20:39.860]  They are now having the Secretary of State in Texas say they want to sue me for questioning
[3:20:39.860 --> 3:20:45.420]  the election, saying I unleashed hell on them, didn't even question the Texas election.
[3:20:45.420 --> 3:20:46.420]  Republicans won.
[3:20:46.420 --> 3:20:48.660]  But just total made up crap.
[3:20:48.660 --> 3:20:52.940]  They're a public official, including an FBI agent never said his name, didn't even know
[3:20:52.940 --> 3:20:57.500]  who he was, so he sued me, suing me for $550 million as part of this.
[3:20:57.500 --> 3:21:00.060]  They won $8.25 billion just from the first count.
[3:21:00.060 --> 3:21:01.060]  There's four counts.
[3:21:01.060 --> 3:21:06.060]  That's what the lawyers asked for last week for questioning Sandy Hook, never said the
[3:21:06.060 --> 3:21:07.060]  name of the FBI agent.
[3:21:07.060 --> 3:21:11.540]  So now bureaucrats can sue you under this precedent for asking questions.
[3:21:11.540 --> 3:21:14.300]  So they're about to announce the verdict.
[3:21:14.300 --> 3:21:19.020]  The jury took like four days of deliberation time, not kind of the weekend to come back.
[3:21:19.020 --> 3:21:20.260]  Here is the judge.
[3:21:20.260 --> 3:21:24.900]  Let's go to the audio of the biggest show trial in U.S. history with the jury.
[3:21:24.900 --> 3:21:25.900]  We'll see what happens.
[3:21:25.900 --> 3:21:26.900]  We'll see if they saw through it.
[3:21:26.900 --> 3:21:27.900]  I don't think they will.
[3:21:27.900 --> 3:21:28.900]  They're already told I'm guilty.
[3:21:28.900 --> 3:21:29.900]  Here it is.
[3:21:29.900 --> 3:21:33.060]  We have reached our unanimous verdict.
[3:21:33.060 --> 3:21:34.060]  Thank you.
[3:21:34.060 --> 3:21:35.060]  Exclamation point.
[3:21:35.060 --> 3:21:36.060]  Great.
[3:21:36.060 --> 3:21:37.060]  Well said.
[3:21:37.060 --> 3:21:38.060]  Thank you for this.
[3:21:38.060 --> 3:21:39.060]  Did you get this to counsel?
[3:21:39.060 --> 3:21:40.060]  Yes.
[3:21:40.060 --> 3:21:50.620]  The judge looks pleased, probably $200 million, I don't have any money so it's all a big joke.
[3:21:50.620 --> 3:21:51.620]  This is their trial.
[3:21:51.620 --> 3:21:54.220]  This is them on trial.
[3:21:54.220 --> 3:21:59.740]  There's Blumenthal's son, the anti-gun Democrat running all this.
[3:21:59.740 --> 3:22:05.100]  Stolen Valor claimed it was a combatant in Vietnam, never went there.
[3:22:05.100 --> 3:22:14.060]  Ambulance chaser, coughs cough up there.
[3:22:14.060 --> 3:22:17.460]  This is Ambulance chasing on steroids.
[3:22:17.460 --> 3:22:21.220]  Proud of our work exposing the deadly shot, proud of our work exposing the ruler, the
[3:22:21.220 --> 3:22:22.220]  wars, all of it.
[3:22:22.220 --> 3:22:23.220]  So proud of our work.
[3:22:23.220 --> 3:22:25.220]  This is the devil coming after us.
[3:22:25.220 --> 3:22:38.980]  Looks so pleased with the jury and she gets to decide their cup of claim on false advertising
[3:22:38.980 --> 3:22:46.580]  too so she can get me later anyways.
[3:22:46.580 --> 3:22:51.220]  This is their political jihad against freedom of speech.
[3:22:51.220 --> 3:22:57.980]  Good afternoon, take your seats please.
[3:22:57.980 --> 3:23:00.100]  I hope it's $50 billion.
[3:23:00.100 --> 3:23:05.260]  Make yourselves comfortable, please be seated, counsel will stipulate that our entire panel
[3:23:05.260 --> 3:23:06.260]  has returned.
[3:23:06.260 --> 3:23:07.260]  Yes.
[3:23:07.260 --> 3:23:11.660]  All right, thank you for your note, I understand that you have reached a verdict, Mr. Farah,
[3:23:11.660 --> 3:23:16.380]  whenever you're ready please.
[3:23:16.380 --> 3:23:21.380]  Ladies and gentlemen, the jury as your number is called, please answer here, rise and remain
[3:23:21.380 --> 3:23:22.380]  standing.
[3:23:22.380 --> 3:23:23.380]  Juror number one.
[3:23:23.380 --> 3:23:24.380]  Here.
[3:23:24.380 --> 3:23:25.380]  Juror number two.
[3:23:25.380 --> 3:23:26.380]  Here.
[3:23:26.380 --> 3:23:27.380]  Juror number three.
[3:23:27.380 --> 3:23:28.380]  Here.
[3:23:28.380 --> 3:23:29.380]  Juror number four.
[3:23:29.380 --> 3:23:30.380]  Here.
[3:23:30.380 --> 3:23:31.380]  Juror number five.
[3:23:31.380 --> 3:23:32.380]  Here.
[3:23:32.380 --> 3:23:33.380]  Juror number six.
[3:23:33.380 --> 3:23:34.380]  Here.
[3:23:34.380 --> 3:23:40.700]  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, in the case of Latvia at all versus Jones, Sherlock at
[3:23:40.700 --> 3:23:46.220]  all versus Jones and Sherlock at all versus Jones, Sherlock, I'm sorry, have you heard
[3:23:46.220 --> 3:23:49.220]  or agreed upon a verdict?
[3:23:49.220 --> 3:23:50.220]  Yes.
[3:23:50.220 --> 3:23:51.220]  Yes.
[3:23:51.220 --> 3:23:54.220]  Would you please pass the verdict to me?
[3:23:54.220 --> 3:24:03.220]  Then you can be seated.
[3:24:03.220 --> 3:24:07.220]  This is them, I'm absolving themselves of all the war crimes, everything.
[3:24:07.220 --> 3:24:15.220]  The media's good, I'm bad.
[3:24:15.220 --> 3:24:33.060]  Well, the virgin nuclear war, this is happening, I questioned the mass shooting, I questioned
[3:24:33.060 --> 3:24:42.220]  Jesse Smollett, WMD's in Iraq, I'm a thought criminal, judge found me guilty, put the jury
[3:24:42.220 --> 3:24:47.220]  how guilty I was.
[3:24:47.220 --> 3:24:53.900]  She's pausing to give the media time to all dial in, with their full effect, try to give
[3:24:53.900 --> 3:24:56.700]  credibility to the corporate system again, which they'll never bring back.
[3:24:56.700 --> 3:25:00.220]  This is a dinosaur trying to be resurrected.
[3:25:00.220 --> 3:25:08.220]  Come on, crucify me, let's get it going.
[3:25:08.220 --> 3:25:24.220]  After rigging this whole thing, not letting me put on evidence, have to put on fake evidence,
[3:25:24.220 --> 3:25:30.220]  after claiming I didn't give evidence, all the fraud, here we are down the line.
[3:25:30.220 --> 3:25:39.220]  Look at the little Blementhal's kid right there, look at him, people are pathetic, their rule
[3:25:39.220 --> 3:25:46.220]  over this country is over, so proud of our work, so proud of your support.
[3:25:46.220 --> 3:25:50.220]  Get two years of appeals now, they won't shut us down, you support us.
[3:25:50.220 --> 3:26:01.220]  The judge just read through the four counts.
[3:26:01.220 --> 3:26:08.220]  How about suspense, we're skipping the network break coming up in three minutes.
[3:26:08.220 --> 3:26:14.220]  I'm just double checking the math, so I am going to send you back with just very minor
[3:26:14.220 --> 3:26:18.220]  instruction, and I'm sorry for this, but I just want to make sure that we cross all the
[3:26:18.220 --> 3:26:24.220]  T's and dot all the I's, and as Attorney Patas said, pointed out, I had asked you,
[3:26:24.220 --> 3:26:28.220]  you probably don't remember now because it was days ago, just to have the four person
[3:26:28.220 --> 3:26:34.220]  initial each page as well as sign, also I don't see any decimal points, and that's fine,
[3:26:34.220 --> 3:26:39.220]  it's consistent throughout, so we can leave it at that, so by that I mean there's no
[3:26:39.220 --> 3:26:43.220]  decimal point zero zero, but that is fine, I just wanted to point that out.
[3:26:43.220 --> 3:26:53.220]  We will send the jury back in with that, and then when you're ready, we'll come back out.
[3:26:53.220 --> 3:26:59.220]  I don't see any decimal points, so that just told you, millions and millions, including
[3:26:59.220 --> 3:27:03.220]  an FBI agent, never said his name, don't know who he is, and that's why we have these
[3:27:03.220 --> 3:27:11.220]  headlines here in my stack where the Texas Attorney General says I unleashed hell by
[3:27:11.220 --> 3:27:15.220]  this election, didn't even question the Texas elections, Project Veritas did a good job
[3:27:15.220 --> 3:27:23.220]  of it, so they're going to come back, but now, oh, you talked bad about general topics,
[3:27:23.220 --> 3:27:29.220]  and if any random government official can now sue you for it, well I was going to skip
[3:27:29.220 --> 3:27:35.220]  this network break, but we don't need to now, so put it back in to function there,
[3:27:35.220 --> 3:27:39.220]  if we can for our stations, and we'll come back after the break on this, people are
[3:27:39.220 --> 3:27:43.220]  asking why I'm laughing, folks, we're on the verge of nuclear war, they just killed 20
[3:27:43.220 --> 3:27:47.220]  million people with poison shots, billions are sick, mainline news is reporting in,
[3:27:47.220 --> 3:27:51.220]  and people literally are mad at me, I questioned a mass shooting that was political from the
[3:27:51.220 --> 3:27:57.220]  beginning, and I will continue to question Jesse Smollett, or WMDs in Iraq, or Nord Stream
[3:27:57.220 --> 3:28:01.220]  Pipelines, or any of it, so I feel good about the work I've done and the listeners of your
[3:28:01.220 --> 3:28:05.220]  support, this corrupt dying political system wants to try to make me the devil, I'm not

[3:33:04.220 --> 3:33:22.220]  Well, we're awaiting the verdict where the jury was already told that I was guilty in
[3:33:22.220 --> 3:33:26.220]  Connecticut in the show trial, and I told people despite the fact that they were out
[3:33:26.220 --> 3:33:32.220]  four or five days, look for a giant billion dollar verdict to ask for 8.25 billion just
[3:33:32.220 --> 3:33:37.220]  for the establishment is, I am so honored to have this happening, so we're waiting while
[3:33:37.220 --> 3:33:41.220]  the judge sent the jury back out because they put decimals on how many million I'm supposed
[3:33:41.220 --> 3:33:46.220]  to give, and that's why it's such a joke, I don't have 2 million dollars in cash, it's
[3:33:46.220 --> 3:33:52.220]  brilliant to run the operation, and so it's a joke, you are standing against them, you
[3:33:52.220 --> 3:33:58.220]  are standing against this fraud, save infowarstore.com, that's how you resist getting great products
[3:33:58.220 --> 3:34:03.220]  at the same time, we're going to appeal this, we're in such a journey they'll probably say
[3:34:03.220 --> 3:34:07.220]  no on the appeal, but two years left, whatever, or the edge nuclear war doesn't even matter,
[3:34:07.220 --> 3:34:12.220]  it shows how tone deaf these people are, but I want an error report, I said I would get
[3:34:12.220 --> 3:34:17.220]  to it, I didn't, weather weaponization, hurricane Ian, they want a 5G control your body, they
[3:34:17.220 --> 3:34:21.220]  want a poison injection control your body, they want to be able to control the weather,
[3:34:21.220 --> 3:34:24.220]  and they admit they're doing it all, they say it's a conspiracy theory and we talk about
[3:34:24.220 --> 3:34:25.220]  it.
[3:34:25.220 --> 3:34:30.220]  Oh wait, they're coming back, and then we'll air the most important thing, weather weapons
[3:34:30.220 --> 3:34:37.220]  news, here we go, as she said, got to add decibels, and boy those amulet chasers got
[3:34:37.220 --> 3:34:44.220]  happy when they heard that, including Senator Stolen, Ballard, Blumenthal got really excited,
[3:34:44.220 --> 3:34:49.220]  this is how they suppress America in the Midwest and Christians, they're so proud of themselves,
[3:34:49.220 --> 3:34:55.220]  this is how the collapsed globalist run east coast tries to rule America and you, they
[3:34:55.220 --> 3:35:12.220]  think they can break your will, they can't break your will, she was promoted to head
[3:35:12.220 --> 3:35:18.220]  judge in the state just two months ago before the trial, her sellout of due process and her
[3:35:18.220 --> 3:35:20.220]  weaponization is just here.
[3:35:20.220 --> 3:35:28.220]  Thank you, please take your seat, the record will reflect that the entire panel has returned,
[3:35:28.220 --> 3:35:33.220]  and thank you for indulging me with that.

[3:35:44.220 --> 3:35:45.220]  the election.
[3:35:45.220 --> 3:35:50.220]  Council wants to be recalled one more time by their number, I don't think it's necessary,
[3:35:50.220 --> 3:35:55.220]  but just bear with me, alright?
[3:35:55.220 --> 3:36:03.220]  A corrupt guilty system wanted to scapegoat me as the bad guy, when they're the bad guys,
[3:36:03.220 --> 3:36:07.220]  no one believes them, everybody hates them and has half a brain, their system's over,
[3:36:07.220 --> 3:36:19.220]  they're in full panic mode, this is exactly what I expected.
[3:36:19.220 --> 3:36:21.220]  And you put the decimal points in.
[3:36:21.220 --> 3:36:23.220]  Oh, the decimal points in?
[3:36:23.220 --> 3:36:32.220]  Oh my god, 50 billion, 100 billion trillion.
[3:36:32.220 --> 3:36:37.220]  They make these lies and all this money we've got, it's all just delusional, let this crap,
[3:36:37.220 --> 3:36:40.220]  like two men can have a baby.
[3:36:40.220 --> 3:36:42.220]  Alright, Mr. Farrell.

[3:43:00.220 --> 3:43:02.220]  Four charges, 15 plaintiffs.
[3:43:02.220 --> 3:43:04.220]  So this is going to go on for a while, okay?
[3:43:04.220 --> 3:43:05.220]  So just put them on full screen.
[3:43:05.220 --> 3:43:08.220]  Let them have their big victory on the edge of nuclear war.
[3:43:08.220 --> 3:43:09.220]  Let's just see these people.
[3:43:09.220 --> 3:43:11.220]  $68,800,000.
[3:43:11.220 --> 3:43:14.220]  Again, Remington's at fault because the woman bought her son a gun.
[3:43:14.220 --> 3:43:16.220]  He killed her with.
[3:43:16.220 --> 3:43:18.220]  I'm at fault because I questioned how this is political.
[3:43:18.220 --> 3:43:23.220]  Slander damages past and future $45 million.
[3:43:23.220 --> 3:43:28.220]  The emotional distress damages past and future $45 million.
[3:43:28.220 --> 3:43:31.220]  Total fair-adjusted reasonable damages.

[3:44:18.220 --> 3:44:23.220]  The emotional distress damages past and future $27 million.

[3:44:33.220 --> 3:44:36.220]  Adline A and line B, $36 million.
[3:44:36.220 --> 3:44:39.220]  Initial slide, journal number one.
[3:44:39.220 --> 3:44:42.220]  Number two, award of attorney's fees and costs.
[3:44:42.220 --> 3:44:44.220]  Instructions, check, yes or no.
[3:44:44.220 --> 3:44:46.220]  By the way, we're almost at a billion.
[3:44:46.220 --> 3:44:48.220]  Now, due to the plaintiff...
[3:44:48.220 --> 3:44:49.220]  $963 million.
[3:44:49.220 --> 3:44:51.220]  And the FBI agent never said his name.
[3:44:51.220 --> 3:44:52.220]  Don't know who he is.
[3:44:52.220 --> 3:44:53.220]  $90 million.
[3:44:53.220 --> 3:44:55.220]  Ha, ha, ha.
[3:44:55.220 --> 3:44:58.220]  Does these people actually believe that money's there?
[3:44:58.220 --> 3:45:05.220]  We, the jury, find that the standard charge for the assessment of attorney's fees and costs have been met.
[3:45:05.220 --> 3:45:07.220]  Yes, it's checked.
[3:45:07.220 --> 3:45:11.220]  Reasonable attorney's fees and costs to be awarded by the judge at a later date.
[3:45:11.220 --> 3:45:14.220]  Initial by journal number one.
[3:45:14.220 --> 3:45:18.220]  The last page is the four-person journal number one signature.
[3:45:18.220 --> 3:45:21.220]  And a hand like that killed their children.
[3:45:21.220 --> 3:45:23.220]  Initial by journal number one.
[3:45:23.220 --> 3:45:29.220]  The verdict may be accepted and recorded.
[3:45:29.220 --> 3:45:31.220]  Ladies and gentlemen, the jury, please listen.
[3:45:31.220 --> 3:45:34.220]  Hey, folks, don't start getting new big houses or anything.
[3:45:34.220 --> 3:45:35.220]  Don't start buying new cars.
[3:45:35.220 --> 3:45:38.220]  Even though you got the $73 million from Remington.
[3:45:38.220 --> 3:45:39.220]  Ain't gonna be happening.
[3:45:39.220 --> 3:45:40.220]  Ain't no money.
[3:45:40.220 --> 3:45:47.220]  If our verdict has two damages in this case, we award damages to each plaintiff and against Alex Jones and three...
[3:45:47.220 --> 3:45:48.220]  I killed the kids, folks.
[3:45:48.220 --> 3:45:49.220]  I think...
[3:45:49.220 --> 3:45:52.220] ...number one, compensatory damages.
[3:45:52.220 --> 3:45:53.220]  Instructions.
[3:45:53.220 --> 3:45:55.220]  Filled in both numbers for each plaintiff.
[3:45:55.220 --> 3:45:57.220]  Now, remember, I'm in bankruptcy.
[3:45:57.220 --> 3:45:58.220]  We got two years of appeals.
[3:45:58.220 --> 3:46:01.220]  The money you donate does not go to these people.
[3:46:01.220 --> 3:46:04.220]  It goes to fight this fraud and it goes to stabilize the company.
[3:46:04.220 --> 3:46:06.220]  They want to shut down.
[3:46:06.220 --> 3:46:09.220]  That's why the ambulance chasers did this.
[3:46:09.220 --> 3:46:11.220]  That's why they use these families.

[3:46:26.220 --> 3:46:27.220]  So you want to fight?
[3:46:27.220 --> 3:46:28.220]  That's fine.
[3:46:28.220 --> 3:46:30.220]  It's your decision.
[3:46:30.220 --> 3:46:32.220]  But that's where we are.
[3:46:32.220 --> 3:46:34.220]  That's the whacked-out system on the left.
[3:46:34.220 --> 3:46:36.220]  Did we hit a billion, guys?
[3:46:36.220 --> 3:46:38.220]  Yeah, with the turning fees, it seems like 30 million.
[3:46:38.220 --> 3:46:41.220]  I think we hit a billion dollars here.
[3:46:41.220 --> 3:46:44.220]  A billion dollars for me questioning the mass shooting scene.
[3:46:44.220 --> 3:46:45.220]  It looked political.
[3:46:45.220 --> 3:46:48.220]  It looked staged.
[3:46:48.220 --> 3:46:52.220]  $9.63.
[3:46:52.220 --> 3:46:56.220]  But if you add the attorney's fees, we're talking a billion.
[3:46:56.220 --> 3:47:00.220]  I'm now the billion-dollar man, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:47:00.220 --> 3:47:09.220]  B, emotional stress damages past and future $30 million.
[3:47:09.220 --> 3:47:10.220]  I'm sorry.
[3:47:10.220 --> 3:47:11.220]  See, there's more charges.
[3:47:11.220 --> 3:47:13.220]  Oh, we're going to get to way past a billion.
[3:47:13.220 --> 3:47:14.220]  Oh, sorry.
[3:47:14.220 --> 3:47:15.220]  $54 million.
[3:47:15.220 --> 3:47:18.220]  Initial writer number one.
[3:47:18.220 --> 3:47:20.220]  Two plaintiffs, Jekyll and Barton.

[3:47:25.220 --> 3:47:31.220]  B, emotional stress damages past and future $18,800,000.
[3:47:31.220 --> 3:47:33.220]  So they had no security at the school.
[3:47:33.220 --> 3:47:36.220]  They covered up what really happened, and now I'm the devil.
[3:47:36.220 --> 3:47:38.220]  I'm actually proud to be under this level of attack.
[3:47:38.220 --> 3:47:42.220]  Aniline A, Aniline B, $28,800,000.
[3:47:42.220 --> 3:47:44.220]  Initial writer number one.
[3:47:44.220 --> 3:47:45.220]  I told you there's four charges.
[3:47:45.220 --> 3:47:46.220]  Two plaintiffs, Mark Barton.
[3:47:46.220 --> 3:47:49.220]  A, defamation slash slander damages past and future $18,800,000.
[3:47:49.220 --> 3:47:51.220]  But remember, all of its cap, but cuppa, which they claimed
[3:47:51.220 --> 3:47:53.220]  I had some unfair business trade.
[3:47:53.220 --> 3:47:55.220]  The judge decides that.
[3:47:55.220 --> 3:47:56.220]  That's where, there's a pattern.
[3:47:56.220 --> 3:47:58.220]  $32,600,000.
[3:47:58.220 --> 3:48:02.220]  Total fair, just and reasonable damages to plaintiffs, Mark Barton.
[3:48:02.220 --> 3:48:05.220]  And against Alex Jones and three speech systems,
[3:48:05.220 --> 3:48:06.220]  Adline A, Adline B.
[3:48:06.220 --> 3:48:08.220]  Why are these numbers only in the millions?
[3:48:08.220 --> 3:48:11.220]  It should be trillions per person.
[3:48:11.220 --> 3:48:12.220]  I'm offended.
[3:48:12.220 --> 3:48:14.220]  Two plaintiffs, Nicole Hockley.
[3:48:14.220 --> 3:48:18.220]  A, defamation slash slander damages past and future $30 million.
[3:48:18.220 --> 3:48:20.220]  It's not something that a hell's like.
[3:48:20.220 --> 3:48:22.220]  They just rate out your damages.
[3:48:22.220 --> 3:48:23.220]  Even though you don't have the money,
[3:48:23.220 --> 3:48:25.220]  you're still going to sit there while they do this.
[3:48:25.220 --> 3:48:26.220]  $100,000.
[3:48:26.220 --> 3:48:30.220]  Total fair, just and reasonable damages to plaintiffs, Nicole Hockley.
[3:48:30.220 --> 3:48:33.220]  And against Alex Jones and three speech systems, Adline A.
[3:48:33.220 --> 3:48:35.220]  It's the gun control lobby made money off of it.
[3:48:35.220 --> 3:48:38.220]  $73,600,000.
[3:48:38.220 --> 3:48:40.220]  Initial writer number one.

[3:49:07.220 --> 3:49:08.220]  Good.
[3:49:08.220 --> 3:49:09.220]  Any one million.
[3:49:09.220 --> 3:49:10.220]  That's good.
[3:49:10.220 --> 3:49:12.220]  We're well past a billion now, right?

[3:49:21.220 --> 3:49:22.220]  It's in the billions, okay?

[3:52:17.220 --> 3:52:20.220]  Let's put up Drudge Report right now for people.
[3:52:20.220 --> 3:52:22.220]  Billion dollars owed by Alex Jones.
[3:52:22.220 --> 3:52:25.220]  I personally don't have $2 million.
[3:52:25.220 --> 3:52:27.220]  The company's almost completely out of money.
[3:52:27.220 --> 3:52:28.220]  We're in bankruptcy.
[3:52:28.220 --> 3:52:29.220]  There's two appeals.
[3:52:29.220 --> 3:52:30.220]  It'll take years.
[3:52:30.220 --> 3:52:31.220]  There's caps on almost all of this.
[3:52:31.220 --> 3:52:35.220]  This is just completely, absolutely made up.
[3:52:35.220 --> 3:52:38.220]  And now the Democratic Party run, CNN bought it years ago.
[3:52:38.220 --> 3:52:40.220]  Literally, I was told that.
[3:52:40.220 --> 3:52:42.220]  Drudge Report is just up there celebrating this.
[3:52:42.220 --> 3:52:48.220]  They want to scare everybody away from freedom and scare us away from
[3:52:48.220 --> 3:52:52.220]  questioning Uvaldi and what really happened there or Parkland or any other event.
[3:52:52.220 --> 3:52:53.220]  And guess what?
[3:52:53.220 --> 3:52:57.220]  We're not scared and we're not going away and we're not going to stop.
[3:52:57.220 --> 3:53:02.220]  And literally for hundreds of thousands of dollars, I can keep them in court for years.
[3:53:02.220 --> 3:53:03.220]  I can appeal this stuff.
[3:53:03.220 --> 3:53:07.220]  We can stand up against this travesty against the billions of dollars they want.
[3:53:07.220 --> 3:53:08.220]  It's a joke.
[3:53:08.220 --> 3:53:17.220]  So please go to infowarstore.com and get vitamin refusion, get X3, get all the great
[3:53:17.220 --> 3:53:29.220]  products that are there that keep us on air at infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[3:53:29.220 --> 3:53:31.220]  You want somebody to fight?
[3:53:31.220 --> 3:53:33.220]  We're going to get attacked for doing it.
[3:53:33.220 --> 3:53:35.220]  You want somebody to stand up?
[3:53:35.220 --> 3:53:36.220]  It's going to happen.
[3:53:36.220 --> 3:53:38.220]  They're going to come after us.
[3:53:38.220 --> 3:53:42.220]  But it's okay because we're here.
[3:53:42.220 --> 3:53:45.220]  It's okay that Tim Cook runs death camps because he's gay.
[3:53:45.220 --> 3:53:51.220]  So these are monsters, a dead system, things that can demonize me, the head populist, and
[3:53:51.220 --> 3:53:53.220]  that will make you all go away and be scared.
[3:53:53.220 --> 3:53:54.220]  But you're not scared.
[3:53:54.220 --> 3:53:55.220]  You're going to stand up.
[3:53:55.220 --> 3:53:58.220]  Flood us with donations at saveinfowars.com.
[3:53:58.220 --> 3:54:02.220]  Hundreds of thousands of dollars can beat their millions of Democratic Party money and
[3:54:02.220 --> 3:54:03.220]  all their frauds.
[3:54:03.220 --> 3:54:09.220]  And get products at infowarstore.com like vitamin mineral fusion and X3, 50% off promo
[3:54:09.220 --> 3:54:14.220]  code 1776 and that will save you another 10%.
[3:54:14.220 --> 3:54:17.220]  But whatever you do, share the articles, share the videos.
[3:54:17.220 --> 3:54:19.220]  Owen Schroyer is going to take over with the war room.
[3:54:19.220 --> 3:54:24.220]  I'll be back with Steve Quayle, Robert Barnes, and so many other big guests, 6 p.m. tonight
[3:54:24.220 --> 3:54:27.220]  for this emergency save info wars broadcast.
[3:54:27.220 --> 3:54:28.220]  And it's simple.
[3:54:28.220 --> 3:54:31.220]  Your pennies counter their millions.
[3:54:31.220 --> 3:54:32.220]  It's that simple.
[3:54:32.220 --> 3:54:33.220]  They're going to lose.
[3:54:33.220 --> 3:54:34.220]  They're going to lose the midterms.
[3:54:34.220 --> 3:54:36.220]  They're trying to launch a nuclear war.
[3:54:36.220 --> 3:54:38.220]  They are going to fail.
[3:54:38.220 --> 3:54:40.220]  These people are out of control.
[3:54:40.220 --> 3:54:41.220]  They had no chivalry.
[3:54:41.220 --> 3:54:42.220]  They had no bottom.
[3:54:42.220 --> 3:54:45.220]  They didn't have a case and they're sued against us.
[3:54:45.220 --> 3:54:49.220]  So the judge found me guilty and then told the jury how guilty I was and wouldn't let
[3:54:49.220 --> 3:54:50.220]  us put on evidence.
[3:54:50.220 --> 3:54:52.220]  And my own lawyer is like, I think you might win.
[3:54:52.220 --> 3:54:53.220]  I think they were listening.
[3:54:53.220 --> 3:54:54.220]  I said no.
[3:54:54.220 --> 3:54:58.220]  They're spending days deciding how many billions are going to give them that doesn't exist.
[3:54:58.220 --> 3:54:59.220]  It's like inflation.
[3:54:59.220 --> 3:55:04.220]  As bad as inflation is in a year or two, a billion dollars will be like $100.
[3:55:04.220 --> 3:55:06.220]  All of this is vestigial.
[3:55:06.220 --> 3:55:08.220]  All this is ceremonial.
[3:55:08.220 --> 3:55:09.220]  All this is going away.
[3:55:09.220 --> 3:55:10.220]  All this is over.
[3:55:10.220 --> 3:55:18.220]  Like the fake college degrees and the 401ks and the systems, none of it means anything.
[3:55:18.220 --> 3:55:24.220]  So I'm so honored to be here on air and laughing at this because they have used these families.
[3:55:24.220 --> 3:55:27.220]  They have squeezed them to Sue Remington and do all this other crap.
[3:55:27.220 --> 3:55:29.220]  And now they're coming after your free speech.
[3:55:29.220 --> 3:55:34.220]  Now they're coming after your right to listen to what you want and hear what you want.
[3:55:34.220 --> 3:55:37.220]  So these ambulance chasers love being all over TV.
[3:55:37.220 --> 3:55:38.220]  They don't have any money.
[3:55:38.220 --> 3:55:40.220]  They don't care about that.
[3:55:40.220 --> 3:55:43.220]  They're using those families who are 73 million.
[3:55:43.220 --> 3:55:44.220]  Not enough.
[3:55:44.220 --> 3:55:45.220]  They need more.
[3:55:45.220 --> 3:55:47.220]  They need more money.
[3:55:47.220 --> 3:55:49.220]  America is at fault.
[3:55:49.220 --> 3:55:52.220]  Adam Lanza was on Prozac and went and killed people.
[3:55:52.220 --> 3:55:54.220]  And Alex Jones is at fault.
[3:55:54.220 --> 3:55:55.220]  It's weakness.
[3:55:55.220 --> 3:55:58.220]  It's not strength that's causing them to do this.
[3:55:58.220 --> 3:56:00.220]  So you want to counterbalance them?
[3:56:00.220 --> 3:56:01.220]  Flood.

[3:56:37.220 --> 3:56:39.220]  I knew this was coming.
[3:56:39.220 --> 3:56:41.220]  I told you to be a billion dollar verdict.
[3:56:41.220 --> 3:56:42.220]  It is.
[3:56:42.220 --> 3:56:47.220]  It's a joke to psychologically manipulate you to break your will and make you give up.
[3:56:47.220 --> 3:56:53.220]  The fact that this attack is so huge, the attack at this is so massive and so disproportionate
[3:56:53.220 --> 3:56:58.220]  and so ridiculous shows how weak these ambulance chasers are.
[3:56:58.220 --> 3:57:04.220]  Because that's what the Democratic Party is, is a bunch of lawyers that hate America who want to destroy our country.
[3:57:04.220 --> 3:57:05.220]  They're good lawyers or bad lawyers.
[3:57:05.220 --> 3:57:06.220]  These are the bad lawyers.
[3:57:06.220 --> 3:57:08.220]  So, want to commend the crew?
[3:57:08.220 --> 3:57:10.220]  Want to commend the listeners and viewers?
[3:57:10.220 --> 3:57:12.220]  Owen Schreuer is loaded for mayor.
[3:57:12.220 --> 3:57:15.220]  He'll have more of this coming up in just two minutes after a break with the war room.

[3:57:21.220 --> 3:57:30.220]  The war room with Owen Schreuer and our emergency 16 hour plus broadcast that goes on to midnight tonight is live now.
[3:57:30.220 --> 3:57:31.220]  Override their tyranny.
[3:57:31.220 --> 3:57:32.220]  Override their censorship.
[3:57:32.220 --> 3:57:34.220]  Everybody you know and text with his email.
[3:57:34.220 --> 3:57:35.220]  You name it.
[3:57:35.220 --> 3:57:38.220]  Tune in now to infowars.com forward slash show.
[3:57:38.220 --> 3:57:39.220]  Great job.

[3:57:40.220 --> 3:57:41.220]  We'll be right back.
[3:57:41.220 --> 3:57:47.220]  Look around you.
[3:57:47.220 --> 3:57:52.220]  Everything I predicted from the global stone documents from their own admissions is now happening.
[3:57:52.220 --> 3:57:54.220]  Info wars credibility.
[3:57:54.220 --> 3:57:56.220]  My credibility has never been higher.
[3:57:56.220 --> 3:58:05.220]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuit stay on air.
[3:58:05.220 --> 3:58:11.220]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[3:58:11.220 --> 3:58:17.220]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air in my decades on air.
[3:58:17.220 --> 3:58:25.220]  I've never asked for personal donations, but I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself.
[3:58:25.220 --> 3:58:26.220]  It's unsustainable.
[3:58:26.220 --> 3:58:34.220]  So please visit save info wars.com save info wars.com where you can make straight donations.
[3:58:34.220 --> 3:58:39.220]  Five, 10, $50, $100, whatever you can so that I can continue to persevere.
[3:58:39.220 --> 3:58:40.220]  I'll never give up.
[3:58:40.220 --> 3:58:42.220]  I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[3:58:42.220 --> 3:58:43.220]  Thank you for your support.
[3:58:43.220 --> 3:58:44.220]  Wouldn't be without you.

[3:58:47.220 --> 3:58:52.220]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist.
[3:58:52.220 --> 3:58:58.220]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but the world.
[3:58:58.220 --> 3:59:03.220]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war.
[3:59:03.220 --> 3:59:05.220]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[3:59:05.220 --> 3:59:12.220]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support them for the real reason we've had this success.
[3:59:12.220 --> 3:59:17.220]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order we've ever had.
[3:59:17.220 --> 3:59:22.220]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[3:59:22.220 --> 3:59:31.220]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[3:59:31.220 --> 3:59:33.220]  God bless you all.
[3:59:33.220 --> 3:59:34.220]  I salute you.
[3:59:34.220 --> 3:59:35.220]  I thank you.
[3:59:35.220 --> 3:59:41.220]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and this is happening.
[3:59:41.220 --> 3:59:42.220]  The fight is my fight.
[3:59:42.220 --> 3:59:43.220]  It's your fight.
[3:59:43.220 --> 3:59:44.220]  It's our fight.
[3:59:44.220 --> 4:00:02.220]  God bless you all.
