[00:00:00.353 --> 00:00:17.957]  So I know I put my life and my family's life in God's hands when I call for the prosecution seeking the death penalty for releasing bioweapons on the public against the globalists, but you've seen Senator Paul's hearings where they bring out that they created a bioweapon on record.
[00:00:17.977 --> 00:00:18.678]  It's in all the documents.
[00:00:18.698 --> 00:00:22.719]  They lied to Congress and they released the damn thing on us and they gave us a shot even worse.
[00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:25.459]  I mean, are we going to sit here and take this?
[00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:27.500]  No more half measures.
[00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.600]  No more games with these people.
[00:00:31.147 --> 00:00:33.190]  Multiple members of our crew almost died.
[00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.172]  Rob Doo almost died.
[00:00:37.315 --> 00:00:38.577]  I had family members that died.
[00:00:39.838 --> 00:00:42.081]  The New World Order killed members of my family.
[00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:43.723]  They killed members of your family.
[00:00:44.204 --> 00:00:46.026]  And with their shots, they killed even more people.
[00:00:46.286 --> 00:00:47.147]  Let that sink in.
[00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:49.550]  So I won't go down as a coward.
[00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:52.806]  I won't sit here and do half measures.
[00:00:53.286 --> 00:01:00.872]  I want to trigger people instinctively to get in the mindset, spiritually, of understanding you're under attack.
[00:01:05.697 --> 00:01:10.301]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.200]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.200]  [MUSIC]
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:31.200]  [MUSIC]
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.200]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:01:36.968 --> 00:01:44.351]  It's Wednesday, October 12th, 2022, and our planet has never been in more danger of total annihilation.
[00:01:45.552 --> 00:01:51.194]  The forces of Satan are attempting to drive humanity into thermonuclear biological chemical war.
[00:01:51.214 --> 00:01:54.796]  400 plus nuclear reactors to melt down.
[00:01:55.636 --> 00:01:58.037]  I would estimate 5 billion dead in the first year.
[00:01:58.917 --> 00:02:00.638]  Maybe 100 million survive.
[00:02:02.128 --> 00:02:03.588]  That's a best-case scenario.
[00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.250]  But the globalists actually say they want to reduce the world population down to just 500 million.
[00:02:13.011 --> 00:02:15.172]  And that's their external statements.
[00:02:15.412 --> 00:02:29.736]  Internal information tells us they believe in a post-human world, and they have made a deal with interdimensional off-world influence, we know as Satan, to actually kill all humans on Earth for the opportunity to merge with this species.
[00:02:31.311 --> 00:02:31.911]  That's who they are.
[00:02:32.072 --> 00:02:32.992]  This is very serious.
[00:02:33.092 --> 00:02:34.093]  Elon Musk talks about it.
[00:02:34.113 --> 00:02:34.913]  This is not a joke.
[00:02:36.935 --> 00:02:40.037]  You notice the media doesn't even make jokes about me saying this because it's a cult.
[00:02:41.237 --> 00:02:44.520]  It's a satanic, anti-human, off-world cult.
[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.902]  The aliens don't attack in flying saucers like Mars attacks.
[00:02:49.397 --> 00:02:49.757]  They're here.
[00:02:50.457 --> 00:02:51.197]  It's interdimensional.
[00:02:51.577 --> 00:02:52.858]  Every ancient religion told you.
[00:02:53.138 --> 00:02:55.158]  The Bible spells it out extremely clearly.
[00:02:55.538 --> 00:03:08.321]  We are dealing with a fallen, off-world species that is parasitic and is seeking to use us, because we're actually more advanced, we just don't know it, we're in embryonic phase, to build them their escape plan model.
[00:03:10.582 --> 00:03:13.502]  They intend to merge with humans and then jump off-world.
[00:03:14.303 --> 00:03:15.723]  We are their escape pod.
[00:03:16.852 --> 00:03:18.093]  Now that's the big secret.
[00:03:18.653 --> 00:03:19.854]  That's what they don't want you to know.
[00:03:20.274 --> 00:03:21.515]  That's why all this is happening.
[00:03:21.775 --> 00:03:32.161]  And once you understand that, it all makes sense once you open the Bible up and read the Old Testament, read the New Testament, read the last book, Revelation, read Daniel, read it all for yourself.
[00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:37.024]  And if you read it like you're going to the store to buy a science fiction book, it makes perfect sense.
[00:03:37.504 --> 00:03:43.762]   If you read it the way these idiot controlled preachers read it, It won't make any sense.
[00:03:43.802 --> 00:03:44.883]  They're doing that by design.
[00:03:45.163 --> 00:03:47.424]  The ancient Christians knew all of this.
[00:03:47.924 --> 00:03:49.625]  The Jews know all of this.
[00:03:50.786 --> 00:03:51.706]  It's the big secret.
[00:03:51.746 --> 00:03:55.288]  The angels, the Ark of the Covenant, Ezekiel's fiery wheel.
[00:03:57.108 --> 00:03:58.089]  The Egyptians knew it.
[00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.751]  The ancient Babylonians knew it.
[00:04:01.791 --> 00:04:03.131]  The Sumerians knew it.
[00:04:04.072 --> 00:04:04.712]  It's a fact.
[00:04:04.792 --> 00:04:06.753]  They've decoded the Sumerian text.
[00:04:08.752 --> 00:04:12.495]  And it's basically what you get in Genesis, but more detailed.
[00:04:13.096 --> 00:04:20.963]  And they make movies about it, like Prometheus, telling you exactly what they believe our real history is.
[00:04:23.265 --> 00:04:36.118]   So, if you ask yourself, why are they injecting us with something that grows nanotech structures in our body, graphene oxide, Why would they be trying to destroy the family?
[00:04:36.138 --> 00:04:37.198]  Why would they be poisoning us?
[00:04:37.578 --> 00:04:38.619]  Why would they be mutating us?
[00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:54.604]  Because they have a program to take us over and in the process use us as their advanced technology engine to then again escape their maroon status on this planet.
[00:04:56.685 --> 00:04:57.265]  Very simple.
[00:04:59.066 --> 00:05:01.147]  Again, you're like, well, if they're so advanced, why do they need us?
[00:05:02.503 --> 00:05:10.650]  Whatever humans imagine we can then build, that's what Genesis tells us, we're made in the image of God, made by God, in his image.
[00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:19.056]  We're not God, but we're made with free will that God has, that God has given us, to do anything we want, basically.
[00:05:19.737 --> 00:05:27.023]  These creatures are just longer along in their development, but not anywhere as advanced as we are, and very robotic.
[00:05:28.184 --> 00:05:30.125]  They see us as, basically, food.
[00:05:31.546 --> 00:05:32.087]  They're falling.
[00:05:34.817 --> 00:05:38.216]  and they can't get up without us.
[00:05:38.216 --> 00:05:42.177]   And that's why they're giving us these horrible ideas and horrible
[00:05:42.177 --> 00:05:47.217]   programs that they can't build but that we can. You've been given the ultimate secret.
[00:05:47.217 --> 00:05:50.617]   We'll be right back with the huge news, biggest cover news yet. It's devastating.
[00:05:50.617 --> 00:05:58.697]   Stay with us. It is Wednesday, October 12th, 2022. We've been live since 8 a.m.
[00:05:58.736 --> 00:06:00.517]  this morning with the great Harrison Smith.
[00:06:00.998 --> 00:06:03.300]  We'll go right through today through the War Room at 6 p.m.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.583]  and then continue on until midnight tonight.
[00:06:08.284 --> 00:06:10.466]  That'll be 16 hours of live broadcast.
[00:06:10.986 --> 00:06:14.910]  We have a big group of amazing guests I'll be telling you about later joining us.
[00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:19.174]  Throughout the entire day until midnight tonight.
[00:06:19.794 --> 00:06:24.455]  This is an Emergency Save Info Wars 1776 broadcast.
[00:06:25.015 --> 00:06:28.375]  We have the Help Save Info Wars 1776 Super Sale is here.
[00:06:28.775 --> 00:06:30.396]  I've extended the big sale and expanded it.

[00:07:03.614 --> 00:07:04.894]  at checkout.
[00:07:05.096 --> 00:07:10.799]  An additional 10% is put on the top because we've got to move everything to fund our operations.
[00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:15.482]  As I said, we got into the black the last six months because of some big donations.
[00:07:16.543 --> 00:07:24.427]  Then because of supply chain breakdowns and some other issues, we got into the red again in the last month and legal bills and all of it.
[00:07:25.067 --> 00:07:32.092]   But thanks to listeners really supporting the last week, we're climbing towards Barely being out of the red again.
[00:07:32.112 --> 00:07:42.234]  This is a sudden death overtime football game or a video game and you know God's in control and making sure it's interesting because let me tell you it's always tread water but thank you for your support.
[00:07:43.515 --> 00:07:44.515]  Thank you for everything you're doing.
[00:07:44.555 --> 00:07:45.915]  We were meant to be on air.
[00:07:45.975 --> 00:07:51.976]  My 28 years building up to this, our 28 years together, many of you have been listening more than 20-25 years.
[00:07:52.396 --> 00:07:57.538]  It's now building towards this moment with the emergence of the new world order and the world government.
[00:07:57.958 --> 00:08:02.616]   So please tell everybody you know today Via email, via text message, that's harder for him to censor.
[00:08:02.856 --> 00:08:05.598]  Via word of mouth, via Instagram, Facebook, Twitter.
[00:08:05.999 --> 00:08:13.324]  That the forbidden man, whose name you must not say, is at InfoWars.com.
[00:08:14.245 --> 00:08:21.911]  And is having a special emergency broadcast covering the most critical information ever.
[00:08:23.232 --> 00:08:25.634]  You want to support InfoWarsStore.com?
[00:08:26.636 --> 00:08:36.463]  If you want to fund my personal legal bills that are 40% of all legal bills for free speech I've got to pay, which is, I'm about almost out of money, then please go to SaveInfoWars.com as well.
[00:08:36.523 --> 00:08:41.006]  But regardless, keep InfoWars on the air, and that is InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:08:41.026 --> 00:08:46.049]  I'm going to stop talking there, and I'm going to just try to calmly get into this right now.
[00:08:47.891 --> 00:08:53.975]  This is actually, this is actually going to take me most of the first hour.
[00:08:56.886 --> 00:08:58.588]  And then I'll tell you about the special guests that are joining us.
[00:09:03.152 --> 00:09:04.814]  I say this every day because it's true.
[00:09:06.576 --> 00:09:07.637]  At least the last six months.
[00:09:08.903 --> 00:09:14.667]  Every day, the COVID news and what they did to us is bigger than all the previous news combined.
[00:09:14.787 --> 00:09:16.708]  It is insane.
[00:09:16.768 --> 00:09:17.849]  It is all out in the open.
[00:09:17.889 --> 00:09:19.470]  God is showing it to us.
[00:09:20.111 --> 00:09:34.261]  We have all these experts and all these patriots and all these good people that stood up and spoke out, and now they admit that the so-called COVID vaccines erase your immune system, cause massive heart attacks, heart swelling, blood clots, cancer, infertility, and literally hundreds of other horrible things.
[00:09:34.641 --> 00:09:43.516]   That's the highest death rate The Western world's ever seen worse than World War I, worse than World War II, worse than Vietnam all combined.
[00:09:44.537 --> 00:09:51.860]  They are murdering tens of millions of people in front of us and very prestigious scientists and statisticians have come out.
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:58.404]  We have the eclipsis hour and confirmed it's hundreds of millions dying from the shots right now worldwide.
[00:10:01.785 --> 00:10:12.802]   Now before I hit all this breaking news, starting next segment for the rest of the hour, I want to talk about the philosophy of the Satanists and why they're doing this.
[00:10:13.102 --> 00:10:14.523]  It's very important to understand.
[00:10:16.904 --> 00:10:17.725]  It's beyond critical.
[00:10:20.506 --> 00:10:28.591]  They are hitting us at every level in a giant open-air mad scientist laboratory.
[00:10:30.792 --> 00:10:31.373]  Laboratory.
[00:10:35.415 --> 00:11:08.494]   And they believe out of this massive attack on humanity It is going to help them develop the secrets of the universe, whether it is the particles of the universe with the CERN superconducting supercollider cyclotron, or whether it is weather control, which they admit they're doing, huge breaking news on that today, or whether it is the 5G and other systems taking over our bodies with these electromagnetic impulses, or whether it's physically taking over our bodies with these nanotech structures that are growing in us with the graphene oxide more that's totally confirmed.
[00:11:11.164 --> 00:11:15.367]  To the social attacks, the spiritual attacks, the economic attacks.
[00:11:17.388 --> 00:11:35.941]  Humanity is being put into a crisis phase and the Luciferians believe that will then create the new Ubermensch and out of that the few survivors will create the super genetic being that will then merge with the machines and become a new life form.
[00:11:37.199 --> 00:11:38.620]  And that's the religion of the New World Order.
[00:11:39.081 --> 00:11:40.622]  I told you about it 25 years ago.
[00:11:41.003 --> 00:11:42.845]  Elon Musk has been talking about it the last few years.
[00:11:43.365 --> 00:11:45.988]  People watch him on Joe Rogan and they put our interviews side by side.
[00:11:46.068 --> 00:11:47.109]  It's word for word what I'm saying.
[00:11:47.529 --> 00:11:51.874]  Because Elon Musk knows, whether he's one of them or not, I think the jury's out on that.
[00:11:52.975 --> 00:11:54.577]  What I'm telling you with this, this is not a game.
[00:11:56.338 --> 00:11:58.279]  And you don't need me to tell you this is going on.
[00:11:58.299 --> 00:12:10.645]  You can turn on the TV and hear, the world would be better without humans, and the future's not human, and by 2047 we'll all be cyborgs or dead, and Google executives say you'll be obsolete if you don't merge the machines.
[00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:15.067]  This is a forced revolution against humanity.
[00:12:16.108 --> 00:12:26.307]   And if you don't resist it, and if you don't become aware of it, and if you don't change your life to Be outside of it, and I'm telling myself that when I tell you.
[00:12:28.208 --> 00:12:32.870]  If you don't make those changes, you will be absorbed before you're destroyed.
[00:12:35.111 --> 00:12:53.360]  And in the process of having your psyche absorbed, you'll be put into a false reality where they believe they can trick you via free will to spiritually decide, that just means next dimensional level, decide to transfer your energy, your spirit, your interdimensional record, into their realm.
[00:12:54.738 --> 00:13:08.854]  They are a lower dimension, a satanic destructive chaos dimension, sucking energy out of the higher dimensions, and the third dimension is the highest platform they can jack into, and our existence is only...
[00:13:09.895 --> 00:13:12.617]  Partially exhibited in the third dimension.
[00:13:13.217 --> 00:13:15.118]  This is only one small part of who we are.
[00:13:15.539 --> 00:13:19.962]  If you could see interdimensionally, you could see your spirit transcending.
[00:13:20.682 --> 00:13:31.269]  It looks like a waterfall of electromagnetic energy or fiber optics into the universe like a tree, fanning out into all consciousness.
[00:13:32.089 --> 00:13:32.550]  I've seen it.
[00:13:33.769 --> 00:13:41.093]  And I didn't even know, and I talked about it 10 years ago on air, people said, well that's the Gnostics, that's the visions of the psychic Christians in Rome.
[00:13:41.954 --> 00:13:42.814]  I hadn't read those writings.
[00:13:43.235 --> 00:13:45.756]  I saw what they saw and beyond.
[00:13:47.437 --> 00:13:48.458]  I've gone beyond.
[00:13:48.538 --> 00:13:50.099]  I'm going to go ahead and just get all this out in the open.
[00:13:50.559 --> 00:13:52.140]  Why do you think the enemy hates me so much?
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.341]  Why do they want to destroy me so much?
[00:13:53.561 --> 00:13:54.701]  It's not for what I've done on air.
[00:13:54.921 --> 00:13:55.582]  That's nothing!
[00:13:59.136 --> 00:14:00.938]  I have gone to the third heaven.
[00:14:01.178 --> 00:14:03.880]  I have been in the third heaven that King David was transported to.
[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:04.921]  I have seen it.
[00:14:05.702 --> 00:14:06.562]  I have seen heaven.
[00:14:07.043 --> 00:14:08.724]  I have seen the highest dimension.
[00:14:08.864 --> 00:14:09.585]  I have seen it.
[00:14:11.146 --> 00:14:14.729]  And God is there and it's so powerful and so amazing.
[00:14:15.149 --> 00:14:17.451]  It's not inter-dimensionally like we think of as humans.
[00:14:17.712 --> 00:14:19.873]  You can't look at it so bright like Moses.
[00:14:21.214 --> 00:14:25.038]  It's that it's so powerful in the consciousness and so complete.
[00:14:26.121 --> 00:14:29.185]  That you can't look at God and come back.
[00:14:30.266 --> 00:14:31.307]  That's why you can't look.
[00:14:31.527 --> 00:14:37.054]  Because if you look, it's total completion, and you will be instantaneously impossible for you to come back.
[00:14:37.515 --> 00:14:38.556]  That's why you can't look at God.
[00:14:39.277 --> 00:14:39.977]  There's no coming back.
[00:14:40.937 --> 00:14:48.747]  It's all-powerful, total consciousness, total goodness, total wisdom, absolute completion, beyond any satisfaction you could ever imagine.
[00:14:49.548 --> 00:14:51.931]  Infinity is like a trillionth of a second.
[00:14:52.071 --> 00:14:58.719]  It is unknowable, it is absolute, beyond any pleasure you could ever imagine.
[00:15:03.248 --> 00:15:09.312]  And they want to try to suck you down to their satanic dimensions so you don't escape and get that.
[00:15:09.432 --> 00:15:10.533]  Because they already know they're losers.
[00:15:10.733 --> 00:15:11.693]  They know they're never going to get that.
[00:15:12.314 --> 00:15:16.436]  I want you to be there with me and all our ancestors that went with God.
[00:15:16.456 --> 00:15:17.457]  We're going to be there together.
[00:15:17.517 --> 00:15:18.298]  Vaya con Dios.
[00:15:18.358 --> 00:15:18.878]  Go with God.
[00:15:19.318 --> 00:15:25.922]  We'll be right back and I'll shift into temporal attacks and the New World Order and the poison injections and the biggest news breaking ever on that front.
[00:15:25.942 --> 00:15:26.283]  Stay with us.
[00:15:28.064 --> 00:15:31.226]  We now take you to the front lines of the fight for human consciousness.
[00:15:31.914 --> 00:15:34.420]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:15:36.183 --> 00:15:41.094]  Alright, so the enemy knew when they launched their bio attack with the COVID-19.
[00:15:41.395 --> 00:15:42.537]  Very serious, real attack.
[00:15:44.426 --> 00:15:57.235]  That once the first phase was ingested, they'd already done mutation tests, that by injecting these poison mRNA shots, it would force a mass mutation, that's mainline virology, that would actually create much deadlier strains.
[00:15:57.335 --> 00:16:11.284]  Instead of a natural progression, normally viruses peak, become destructive, and then the human population absorbs them, creates its own antibodies, and defeats it, and the virus becomes weaker and weaker in the next few years.
[00:16:12.185 --> 00:16:18.249]  Instead, it became much more communicable and much more deadly in the last few years.
[00:16:18.369 --> 00:16:23.192]  And then, finally, humanity overrode the deadly shots, the mutations, and even defeated those.
[00:16:24.131 --> 00:16:30.731]   Also somebody else in a laboratory, it's all been confirmed, a year ago released the next
[00:16:30.731 --> 00:16:38.471]   variant in Africa that had been genetically changed in more than 30 spots that was basically
[00:16:38.471 --> 00:16:45.211]   a real open-air vaccine that actually countered what the globalists had released.
[00:16:45.211 --> 00:16:48.531]  We don't know who those white hats are, but it was done.
[00:16:48.531 --> 00:16:51.330]   Or the globalists could have done it for some other reason, they thought their test was
[00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:52.871]  getting out of hand.
[00:16:52.871 --> 00:16:55.490]   We don't know, that's what the top scientists have confirmed.
[00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:59.210]   Just like they knew two and a half years ago the virus was made in a lab, they looked at
[00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:03.931]   that new variant and they said this is man-made too and it goes in and basically inoculates
[00:17:03.931 --> 00:17:05.171]  people.
[00:17:05.171 --> 00:17:07.371]  So that's what's been unfolding there.
[00:17:07.992 --> 00:17:09.534]  Here's the ultra giant news.
[00:17:10.375 --> 00:17:13.938]  We already know this huge news, but now the news is being pushed.
[00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:19.805]  Now it's breaking through in a just a gigantic way, a colossal way, a gargantuan way.
[00:17:21.687 --> 00:17:24.510]  And that is that it wasn't a vaccine.
[00:17:25.377 --> 00:17:28.547]  It erases your immune system. They knew it would hurt you.
[00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:30.176]  They'd already tested it on animals.
[00:17:30.176 --> 00:17:35.857]   They lied and said they hadn't tested it. And so to get away with the fact that they had tested
[00:17:35.857 --> 00:17:40.896]   it and it hurt people, they said, "No, we haven't tested it, but warp speed," and here's the big lie,
[00:17:40.896 --> 00:17:44.096]  "it will protect you."
[00:17:44.392 --> 00:17:49.156]  Now they can walk it back now and say, well, we told you we didn't know it would work in the fine print.
[00:17:49.816 --> 00:17:51.357]  That's how we knew two and a half years ago it wouldn't work.
[00:17:51.497 --> 00:17:52.238]  We read the fine print.
[00:17:53.079 --> 00:17:54.220]  Top scientists read the fine print.
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:55.541]  We said it's not going to work.
[00:17:55.581 --> 00:17:56.081]  It doesn't work.
[00:17:56.101 --> 00:17:56.722]  They know it doesn't work.
[00:17:57.082 --> 00:17:57.542]  Oh, shut up.
[00:17:57.562 --> 00:17:58.043]  You're censored.
[00:17:58.063 --> 00:17:58.523]  You're a liar.
[00:17:59.043 --> 00:18:01.585]  But again, they had to admit that early on in fine print.
[00:18:01.625 --> 00:18:02.786]  So when it came out, it didn't work.
[00:18:03.027 --> 00:18:05.449]  They would have plausible liability and say, well, we kind of told you.
[00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:06.709]  See how that works?
[00:18:07.009 --> 00:18:17.072]  But they had governments all sign on for total liability protection to the so-called vaccine big pharma makers, so they could then fully corrupt the governments who've signed on to mass murder.
[00:18:17.592 --> 00:18:25.814]  Now instead of them getting in trouble, they get even more power because they've committed the entire human structure of the power structure to the mass murder, to the genocide.
[00:18:26.915 --> 00:18:28.515]  Now they can blackmail them and control them.
[00:18:30.035 --> 00:18:31.656]  That's how this satanic logic works.
[00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:40.156]  But if people understand that compendium and the entire manipulation, the globalists go down instead of being able to launch this and then get away with it.
[00:18:41.397 --> 00:18:49.324]  And so they desperately, desperately, desperately, desperately needed this to roll out in the early phases before it got exposed.
[00:18:49.984 --> 00:18:54.541]   But because it did get exposed early, The majority of people did not take the poison shots.
[00:18:54.561 --> 00:18:56.761]  Now almost no one's taking the poison shots.
[00:18:57.201 --> 00:18:59.702]  And so their plan did not get executed the way they want.
[00:18:59.902 --> 00:19:00.762]  It blew up in their face.
[00:19:01.122 --> 00:19:02.103]  It's still been devastating.
[00:19:02.143 --> 00:19:03.363]  It still killed tens of millions.
[00:19:03.983 --> 00:19:07.384]  But now it's backfiring on them in ways they didn't expect.
[00:19:08.204 --> 00:19:10.665]  And humanity that was asleep at the switch is now waking up.
[00:19:11.725 --> 00:19:12.586]  So here's the big news.
[00:19:13.346 --> 00:19:25.775]   In the European Union, as I told you a few weeks ago, they've demanded that these Pfizer executives and Moderna executives and others testifying, and Albert Bourla, the head of Pfizer, truly evil man.
[00:19:26.556 --> 00:19:28.079]  He was going to testify last week.
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.421]  He then refused.
[00:19:29.762 --> 00:19:30.363]  Didn't show up.
[00:19:31.317 --> 00:19:54.610]  So the hearings are happening last week and this week in the European Union Parliament, and they are being eviscerated in there by reminding them that they went on TV, the executives, the politicians, all of them, and read the script put out by Pfizer, Moderna, and Bill Gates, and Peter Daszak, and the EcoHealth Alliance, and Fauci, all the same Ringling League of Criminals involved in making the virus, releasing it, running the global UN response.
[00:19:55.571 --> 00:19:56.011]  Here's the key.
[00:19:58.243 --> 00:20:01.404]  They're now saying, well, we told you from the beginning it wasn't going to work.
[00:20:02.665 --> 00:20:03.245]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:20:03.945 --> 00:20:06.046]  You said at the beginning you didn't know if it would work.
[00:20:06.987 --> 00:20:19.812]  But you lied and censored anybody that pointed that out and told everybody 96% effective, 84% effective, 72% effective, 67% effective, 51% effective, 44% effective.
[00:20:19.832 --> 00:20:25.514]  And now they go, well, actually, it makes you get COVID and makes you sick and gives you an eight times chance of dying.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.781]  They knew that day one, and they're trying to play games.
[00:20:29.801 --> 00:20:38.123]  If you're going to bio-attack people with a virus and then the vaccine that's even worse, it's not a vaccine, you've got to have a story of how you messed up.
[00:20:38.483 --> 00:20:38.963]  Here's the key.
[00:20:40.004 --> 00:20:40.744]  Keep Key Two.
[00:20:41.664 --> 00:20:52.467]  They intended, and it's in the SPARS 2025-2028 document, War Game, they intended this to break the social contract and make everyone hate the government and cause civil war worldwide.
[00:20:53.891 --> 00:21:10.683]  But if people know it's a master plan to create the Civil War, we don't blow up our government, we don't burn things down, we politically take control and then prosecute and then execute the war criminals after they've had a trial, after they've been given appeals, everything.
[00:21:10.703 --> 00:21:16.968]  But yes, obviously, the people that launched these bio-attacks need to be arrested, need to be tried, and need to be executed.
[00:21:17.028 --> 00:21:17.508]  My God.
[00:21:17.628 --> 00:21:19.990]  If there's a death penalty out there, it's for these people.
[00:21:20.856 --> 00:21:24.278]  As an example to other criminals like them, you want to kill tens of millions of us?
[00:21:24.518 --> 00:21:26.018]  You want to maim billions of people?
[00:21:26.719 --> 00:21:29.160]  We're going to hang your ass on international television.
[00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:32.261]  There'll be 7 billion viewers when you're swinging at the end of a rope.
[00:21:33.842 --> 00:21:37.344]  And yes, I'm saying it, they need to be executed.
[00:21:37.944 --> 00:21:42.806]  But nobody should bomb them, nobody should shoot them, in fact they'll probably do it themselves, play victim.
[00:21:43.606 --> 00:21:48.949]  We take our governments back, we indict them, we arrest them, we try them, and then we hang their asses.
[00:21:50.305 --> 00:21:51.846]  Now, yeah, gloves are off, folks.
[00:21:52.226 --> 00:21:58.129]  So, they all need to swing from an end of a rope if we've got any future.
[00:21:58.189 --> 00:21:59.970]  They hit us with a damn bioweapon.
[00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:01.731]  They killed members of my family.
[00:22:02.251 --> 00:22:03.992]  They almost killed some of my best friends.
[00:22:06.454 --> 00:22:08.014]  I've had all sorts of crap in my life.
[00:22:08.034 --> 00:22:09.295]  Let me tell you, this is a bioweapon.
[00:22:09.495 --> 00:22:11.376]  I was gulping for air for two weeks and couldn't breathe.
[00:22:11.416 --> 00:22:12.056]  I still did the show.
[00:22:12.096 --> 00:22:12.717]  I said, screw it.
[00:22:15.298 --> 00:22:18.140]  But the point is, is I just walked through all that.
[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:18.580]  You understand?
[00:22:19.284 --> 00:22:21.446]  And I'm going to come back in the longer segment.
[00:22:21.466 --> 00:22:26.290]  I'm going to play you a compilation of these murdering New World Order criminals.
[00:22:28.271 --> 00:22:35.076]  These murdering New World Order criminals telling you two years ago and a year ago, this thing is 100% effective.
[00:22:35.357 --> 00:22:37.138]  If you take this, you will be protected.
[00:22:37.338 --> 00:22:40.741]  When they knew damn well it wouldn't protect you and the fine print, they said it.
[00:22:42.543 --> 00:22:51.072]  Now, they can try to go back and say, oh, but we told you we didn't know it would work, but you did go on TV, and you did put out press releases saying it would work.
[00:22:51.472 --> 00:22:54.575]  You didn't come out and say, we have no idea if this will work or not.
[00:22:55.036 --> 00:23:02.343]  When their own internal documents said it's going to cause heart attacks, heart swelling, blood clots, strokes, and everything else you can imagine, in the government's own documents, October 2000, CDC.
[00:23:04.707 --> 00:23:08.491]  So they fine-printed this to cover their asses, but people are smart.
[00:23:08.691 --> 00:23:10.313]  That doesn't cover your ass!
[00:23:10.934 --> 00:23:17.701]  Just because you leave a note with mommy that you're gonna go rob a bank, doesn't mean it's okay for you to rob a bank, you bureaucratic little monsters!
[00:23:18.001 --> 00:23:22.125]  You greedy bastards that think there's too many people, and you're gonna decide who dies!
[00:23:23.086 --> 00:23:23.907]  They're murderers!
[00:23:24.148 --> 00:23:25.149]  They're psychopaths!
[00:23:25.349 --> 00:23:26.050]  They're killers!
[00:23:28.752 --> 00:23:33.035]  So when I get up here and talk about how they need to be executed, I don't sit up there and say that to act tough.
[00:23:33.536 --> 00:23:36.037]  I say it because it's justice and it's what's right.
[00:23:36.318 --> 00:23:39.060]  But no extrajudicial violence.
[00:23:40.441 --> 00:23:40.981]  Indicted.
[00:23:41.541 --> 00:23:42.082]  Arrested.
[00:23:42.442 --> 00:23:42.942]  Tried.
[00:23:43.383 --> 00:23:44.724]  Public execution!
[00:23:46.725 --> 00:23:47.886]  Public execution!
[00:23:50.008 --> 00:23:51.469]  These people make Hitler blush.
[00:23:52.249 --> 00:23:54.111]  And they must be brought to justice.
[00:23:55.852 --> 00:23:56.873]  Now, they want to come clean?
[00:24:00.014 --> 00:24:04.816]  They can be given life in prison, but only those that blow the whistle will be given life in prison.
[00:24:05.377 --> 00:24:07.298]  Everyone else needs to be executed.
[00:24:08.058 --> 00:24:21.765]  So I know I put my life and my family's life in God's hands when I call for the prosecution seeking the death penalty for releasing bioweapons on the public against the globalists, but you've seen Senator Paul's hearings.
[00:24:23.086 --> 00:24:30.451]  Where they bring out that they created a bioweapon, on record, it's in all the documents, they lied to Congress, and they released the damn thing on us, and they gave us a shot even worse.
[00:24:31.872 --> 00:24:33.173]  I mean, are we gonna sit here and take this?
[00:24:34.114 --> 00:24:36.355]  No more half-measures, no more games with these people.
[00:24:38.877 --> 00:24:40.918]  Multiple members of our crew almost died.
[00:24:41.419 --> 00:24:42.900]  Rob Due almost died.
[00:24:45.041 --> 00:24:46.262]  I had family members that died.
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.782]  The New World Order killed members of my family.
[00:24:50.002 --> 00:24:51.423]  They killed members of your family.
[00:24:51.883 --> 00:24:53.724]  And with their shots, they killed even more people.
[00:24:53.984 --> 00:24:54.845]  Let that sink in.
[00:24:55.545 --> 00:24:57.286]  So I won't go down as a coward.
[00:24:58.807 --> 00:25:00.529]  I won't sit here and do half measures.
[00:25:01.009 --> 00:25:08.574]  I want to trigger people instinctively to get in the mindset, spiritually, of understanding you're under attack.
[00:25:10.215 --> 00:25:12.296]  And the evil on this planet is not all powerful.
[00:25:12.336 --> 00:25:13.397]  We have God on our side.
[00:25:13.717 --> 00:25:14.438]  And God's watching.
[00:25:18.464 --> 00:25:22.186]  We've known before they rolled out the poison shots, the frankenshots, they would do this.
[00:25:22.326 --> 00:25:25.748]  Because the globalists, again, like to admit what they're going to do before they do it metaphysically.
[00:25:25.788 --> 00:25:26.428]  It's a rule they have.
[00:25:27.008 --> 00:25:28.089]  And I already went into the reasons earlier.
[00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:41.795]  So, now, they want to destroy confidence in government and systems and create all sorts of hate and despair and soft-killed, half-dead people to bring down civilization.
[00:25:41.815 --> 00:25:46.978]  They want to move on to the next thing, inflation and war and collapsing borders and crime and all the rest of it.
[00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:52.224]  When they're the ones that created the policies on record that created that!
[00:25:52.604 --> 00:25:53.065]  On record!
[00:25:54.646 --> 00:25:55.427]  Right down the line!
[00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:23.394]   But the good news is, in Latin America, in Africa, in Asia, in the Middle East, in Europe, in Russia, in the United States, in Mexico, in Canada, We have leaders, not just Bolsonaro, not just DeSantis, but the Mexican president coming out and saying big pharma's behind these shots and these shots are hurting people and young people shouldn't take them.
[00:26:24.834 --> 00:26:27.835]  Saying if you're an adult and want to hurt yourself, go ahead, but young people shouldn't be taking it.
[00:26:28.055 --> 00:26:30.876]  That's the Mexican president because he's got a soul.
[00:26:32.156 --> 00:26:37.037]  And when it comes to actually killing kids, these guys put their lives in their hands.
[00:26:37.558 --> 00:26:41.224]   They killed five African Presidents.
[00:26:42.564 --> 00:26:45.806]  Two of them were doctors that came out and pointed out this is all a scam and a fraud.
[00:26:46.626 --> 00:26:48.787]  And Ivermectin was the answer and the shots were killing people.
[00:26:49.107 --> 00:26:49.888]  They killed five of them.
[00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:54.450]  President of Haiti came out and said it was a fraud, don't take the shot.
[00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:57.331]  And they came to his house and tortured him to death and blew his head off.
[00:27:00.173 --> 00:27:00.373]  So...
[00:27:02.213 --> 00:27:07.995]  This is extremely dangerous to fight, but it's way more dangerous to go along with these people.
[00:27:08.035 --> 00:27:09.655]  I'm not going to wait until they release the next virus.
[00:27:09.875 --> 00:27:18.677]  I'm not going to wait until the next lockdown and just sit there and cower in my house hoping my family doesn't die from the next weapon that the New World Order and Bill Gates release.
[00:27:19.118 --> 00:27:20.358]  No, sir.
[00:27:20.998 --> 00:27:21.858]  Not going to happen.
[00:27:22.438 --> 00:27:25.718]   We're going to expose these monsters and we're going to beat them.
[00:27:25.718 --> 00:27:31.258]  So.
[00:27:31.258 --> 00:27:41.258]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:27:32.642 --> 00:27:35.744]  You can be with DeSantis and Bolsonaro and the Mexican President.
[00:27:38.626 --> 00:27:40.687]  Or you can be with Bill Gates and Fauci and the New World Order.
[00:27:40.707 --> 00:27:41.448]  Who are you going to be with?
[00:27:43.209 --> 00:27:45.010]  China won't take these mRNA shots.
[00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:47.072]  Russia won't take these mRNA shots.
[00:27:47.712 --> 00:27:48.352]  Because they knew.
[00:27:49.333 --> 00:27:50.614]  Our own governments hate us.
[00:27:51.114 --> 00:27:51.975]  They're not our governments.
[00:27:51.995 --> 00:27:53.216]  They've been hijacked by criminals.
[00:27:54.164 --> 00:27:57.567]  And if they can trick us that it's the government that's the enemy and get a civil war going, they win.
[00:27:57.847 --> 00:28:06.834]  If a hijacker jumps up with a bomb and a machine gun on the plane and takes over the pilot and co-pilot, you don't blame the airline, you don't blame the pilots, you blame the terrorist.
[00:28:08.856 --> 00:28:16.862]  And the New World Order that's hijacked our country has the same legitimacy as a hijacker that's taken over a jumbo jet.
[00:28:18.288 --> 00:28:19.689]  Which is zero credibility.
[00:28:20.329 --> 00:28:22.031]  Everything they said was a lie on purpose.
[00:28:22.391 --> 00:28:23.792]  Everything was a systematic fraud.
[00:28:24.092 --> 00:28:25.133]  They blocked therapeutics.
[00:28:25.313 --> 00:28:26.234]  They censored the truth.
[00:28:26.634 --> 00:28:29.436]  The big tech and the media aided and abetted in murder.
[00:28:29.716 --> 00:28:36.261]  So all you trendy liberals that love your paycheck and love feeling like you're a part of the power structure, you're mass murderers now.
[00:28:36.521 --> 00:28:38.663]  How's it feel to be mass murderers?
[00:28:39.163 --> 00:28:43.086]  There'll be a cost, spiritually, for what you've done.
[00:28:43.306 --> 00:28:44.067]  But don't worry.
[00:28:44.895 --> 00:28:47.738]  You're not going to have to wait until you leave this body to be punished.
[00:28:48.058 --> 00:28:57.589]  You'll be punished by destroying your own nest, going along with evil, pretending like you were part of the power structure, and destroying your own future in the process, you idiots!
[00:28:57.609 --> 00:29:01.193]  So let's start getting to the clips.
[00:29:03.098 --> 00:29:04.699]  Again, they're trying to do a bait-and-switcher.
[00:29:04.899 --> 00:29:07.019]  Well, we told you we didn't test it.
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.120]  It might not work.
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:09.040]  We didn't know if it would work.
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:15.182]  No, you said it would totally work, and you lied on purpose, and you suppressed those that said it wouldn't.
[00:29:15.503 --> 00:29:16.323]  It had major risk.
[00:29:17.711 --> 00:29:18.512]  That's the truth.
[00:29:18.852 --> 00:29:26.139]  So here's a compilation of some of the New World Order scumbags reading off their talking points about, oh, you take the shot, you're protected.
[00:29:26.179 --> 00:29:26.519]  Here it is.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:31.163]  During 2021, we should be able to manufacture a lot of vaccines.
[00:29:31.283 --> 00:29:42.112]   And that vaccine, our key goal is to stop the transmission, to get the immunity levels up so that you get almost no We can kind of almost see the end.
[00:29:42.192 --> 00:29:43.433]  We're vaccinating so very fast.
[00:29:43.553 --> 00:29:49.977]  Our data from the CDC today suggests, you know, that vaccinated people do not carry the virus, don't get sick.
[00:29:49.797 --> 00:29:50.636]  back to normal.
[00:29:50.636 --> 00:29:52.596]  We can kind of almost see the end.
[00:29:52.596 --> 00:29:55.076]  We're vaccinating so very fast.
[00:29:55.076 --> 00:30:02.155]   Our data from the CDC today suggests, you know, that vaccinated people do not carry the virus,
[00:30:02.155 --> 00:30:03.336]  don't get sick.
[00:30:03.336 --> 00:30:09.155]   Now we know that the vaccines work well enough that the virus stops with every vaccinated person.
[00:30:09.155 --> 00:30:11.457]  A vaccinated person gets exposed to the virus.
[00:30:12.428 --> 00:30:13.969]  The virus does not infect them.
[00:30:14.029 --> 00:30:16.530]  The virus cannot then use that person to go anywhere else.
[00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:20.731]  It cannot use a vaccinated person as a host to go get more people.
[00:30:20.851 --> 00:30:25.092]  That means the vaccines will get us to the end of this.
[00:30:25.633 --> 00:30:31.114]  Essentially, vaccines block you from getting and giving the virus.
[00:30:31.294 --> 00:30:37.937]  Fully vaccinated people are at a very, very low risk of getting COVID-19.
[00:30:39.625 --> 00:30:44.887]  Therefore, if you've been fully vaccinated, you no longer need to wear a mask.
[00:30:45.147 --> 00:30:49.129]  When people are vaccinated, they can feel safe that they are not going to get infected.
[00:30:49.329 --> 00:30:51.549]  We have all the vaccines we need.
[00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:54.451]  We just need our people to take it.
[00:30:55.211 --> 00:31:02.130]   for their own protection, for the protection of their family, but also to break the chain
[00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:07.730]   of transmission. You want to be a dead end to the virus. So when the virus gets to you,
[00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:14.290]   you stop it. You don't allow it to use you as the stepping stone to the next person.
[00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:19.890]   I think given the country as a whole, the fact that we have now about 50% of adults
[00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:28.250]   fully vaccinated and about 62% of adults having received at least one dose as a nation, I
[00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:33.010]   feel fairly certain you're not going to see the kind of surges we've seen in the past.
[00:31:33.595 --> 00:31:40.279]  If you're vaccinated, you're not going to be hospitalized, you're not going to be in an ICU unit, and you're not going to die.
[00:31:40.479 --> 00:31:41.200]  You're okay.
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:45.282]  You're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations.
[00:31:47.243 --> 00:31:47.963]  You're okay.
[00:31:47.983 --> 00:31:48.824]  You're not going to get COVID.
[00:31:48.864 --> 00:31:54.347]  Now you're more likely to get COVID, more likely to be hospitalized, and in the studies, eight times more likely to die.
[00:31:57.386 --> 00:31:59.690]  Because the shot gives you COVID, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:01.372 --> 00:32:06.060]  And we come back, clips from the parliamentary hearings in the European Union.
[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:10.643]  Remember, the EU was set up during a steel deal in 56, the Treaty of Rome.
[00:32:11.063 --> 00:32:14.045]  So it's a dictatorship, but they said, oh, but you'll have a ceremonial parliament.
[00:32:14.646 --> 00:32:27.836]  Well, ceremonial's still powerful because it's a bully pulpit, and now they're destroying Pfizer and Moderna in these hearings and having them admit, we never tested it, we didn't know if it would work or not, but we told people it would.
[00:32:28.156 --> 00:32:29.257]  That's the key.
[00:32:29.577 --> 00:32:30.298]  They lied.
[00:32:31.647 --> 00:32:32.768]  And they're doing this bait-and-switch.
[00:32:32.788 --> 00:32:34.369]  All right, we're gonna go to break, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:36.751]  We're gonna come back and play all these clips straight ahead.
[00:32:36.891 --> 00:32:37.872]  I'm gonna open the phones up again.
[00:32:37.912 --> 00:32:40.293]  Got a bunch of big guests I'll tell you about coming up.
[00:32:41.094 --> 00:32:42.415]  Trying to figure out which times they're on today.
[00:32:42.455 --> 00:32:44.176]  We're going live until midnight tonight.

[00:33:41.529 --> 00:33:52.035]  All you've got to do is not submit and build the new world against the counterfeit new world that Satan's trying to construct on the ashes of humanity with the Build Back Better Great Reset Agenda.
[00:33:52.475 --> 00:33:53.336]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:33:53.376 --> 00:33:58.699]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live, Wednesday, October 12th, Global Transmission.
[00:34:01.724 --> 00:34:02.444]  Really good news.
[00:34:02.524 --> 00:34:03.885]  We've known the battle plan from the beginning.
[00:34:03.925 --> 00:34:04.685]  We've studied the enemy.
[00:34:04.845 --> 00:34:05.646]  We've been proven right.
[00:34:05.786 --> 00:34:06.406]  It's not hard.
[00:34:06.466 --> 00:34:07.726]  You can figure out the battle plan too.
[00:34:08.047 --> 00:34:09.167]  Don't need me to tell it to you.
[00:34:09.687 --> 00:34:14.509]  Once you understand that they think you're dumb, they think you're an animal, their arrogance will be their undoing.
[00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:22.272]  They also like to act powerful in front of their minions so they admit it all in white papers so their minions won't be scared to carry out mass murder and criminal activity.
[00:34:22.752 --> 00:34:24.193]  So there's other reasons they do it as well.
[00:34:24.593 --> 00:34:27.274]  Not just chutzpah or arrogance or bravado.
[00:34:30.191 --> 00:34:32.993]  Or all the other deadly sins of arrogance.
[00:34:34.054 --> 00:34:44.762]  So, here we are, in the space-time continuum, and you have the Pfizer executives, not the CEO, he wouldn't show up, but others admitting, yeah, we didn't test it.
[00:34:45.542 --> 00:34:54.569]  Oh, but you knew it would work, and was first 100% effective, then 96% effective, and then, oh, it actually gives you the virus, it makes you sick, and it kills you, in many cases.
[00:34:55.677 --> 00:34:56.758]  So let's go to these clips here.
[00:34:57.458 --> 00:34:59.800]  This is a key clip.
[00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:03.463]  This is a member of the European Union Parliament, Rob Roos.
[00:35:04.463 --> 00:35:09.547]  Pfizer admits the vaccine ability to prevent transmissions never tested, but they lied to the public.
[00:35:09.767 --> 00:35:10.107]  Here it is.
[00:35:11.168 --> 00:35:18.110]  For the first time Pfizer admitted that the vaccine was not tested on stopping the transmission of the virus when it entered the market.
[00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:20.971]  And this has massive implications.
[00:35:21.571 --> 00:35:27.854]   Governments pushed millions of people worldwide to get vaccinated by telling them Yes.
[00:35:27.914 --> 00:35:32.354]  by telling you to do it for your grandmother.
[00:35:32.354 --> 00:35:38.474]   And they tricked perfectly healthy young people into taking this jab using false arguments.
[00:35:38.474 --> 00:35:44.874]   And they used big words such as anti-social to sow an immense hatred against people who
[00:35:44.874 --> 00:35:47.314]  refuse to comply with the government's wishes.
[00:35:47.756 --> 00:35:53.822]  And even worse, many governments, including mine, actually introduced so-called COVID passports.
[00:35:54.282 --> 00:35:57.505]  These passports made access to parts of society conditional.
[00:35:58.226 --> 00:36:06.694]  Those who did not wish to get vaccinated lost that access, not being able to visit a restaurant or a gym, all in the name of public health.
[00:36:07.791 --> 00:36:15.736]  Our governments love to talk about institutional discrimination, but this was real institutional discrimination.
[00:36:16.196 --> 00:36:22.200]  In many countries, like the US and Italy, vaccine mandates were introduced for certain professions.
[00:36:22.661 --> 00:36:28.805]  Many people lost their job, their livelihood, their business, because they stood by their principles.
[00:36:29.659 --> 00:36:31.400]  Now what he's saying here is key.
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:35.042]  We're trained to think of discrimination for what color you are, and that goes on.
[00:36:35.082 --> 00:36:35.543]  It's wrong.
[00:36:36.043 --> 00:36:42.167]  But this is discrimination against people that are smart and say no, but we're only trained to go, oh, it's discrimination.
[00:36:42.207 --> 00:36:45.669]  We don't chop an eight-year-old's balls off or a ten-year-old girl's breast off.
[00:36:45.969 --> 00:36:49.531]  Oh, let her chop her breast off because the government told her to and tricked her to.
[00:36:49.571 --> 00:36:50.191]  That's a right.
[00:36:50.532 --> 00:36:51.972]  Oh, let the NSA spy on you.
[00:36:51.993 --> 00:36:53.013]  Let big tech spy on you.
[00:36:53.033 --> 00:36:55.995]  But we're also going to forcibly put an injection in you.
[00:36:56.937 --> 00:37:01.818]  And PayPal is going to surveil what you say on your website or what you say on Facebook.
[00:37:01.978 --> 00:37:04.318]  And if they don't like it, they're going to fine you $2,500.
[00:37:04.658 --> 00:37:06.899]  That's discrimination for what you're thinking.
[00:37:07.279 --> 00:37:11.540]  Mind discrimination for your views, for your religion, for your economic ideas.
[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:13.820]  Now, here's the clip that I wanted to get to.
[00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:23.262]  Here's the same member of Parliament making a quick statement and then showing the clip where he confronted the spokesperson of Pfizer when Albert Bourla wouldn't show up.
[00:37:24.497 --> 00:37:27.438]  If you don't get vaccinated, you're anti-social.
[00:37:28.018 --> 00:37:31.259]  This is what the Dutch Prime Minister and Health Minister told us.
[00:37:32.099 --> 00:37:35.741]  You don't get vaccinated just for yourself, but also for others.
[00:37:36.461 --> 00:37:38.281]  You do it for all of society.
[00:37:38.882 --> 00:37:39.582]  That's what I said.
[00:37:40.402 --> 00:37:43.043]  Today, this turned out to be complete nonsense.
[00:37:44.062 --> 00:37:56.100]  In a COVID hearing in the European Parliament, one of the Pfizer directors just admitted to me, at the time of introduction, the vaccine had never been tested on stopping the transmission of the virus.
[00:37:57.190 --> 00:38:00.932]  This removes the entire legal basis for the COVID passport.
[00:38:01.372 --> 00:38:08.835]  The COVID passport that led to massive institutional discrimination as people lost access to essential parts of society.
[00:38:09.696 --> 00:38:12.077]  I find this to be shocking, even criminal.
[00:38:12.777 --> 00:38:14.738]  Please watch the video until the end.
[00:38:16.258 --> 00:38:20.560]  For you, Mrs. Small, I have the following question, which I want a clear answer to.
[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:24.122]  And I will speak in English, so there are no misunderstandings.
[00:38:25.652 --> 00:38:35.358]  Was the Pfizer COVID vaccine tested on stopping the transmission of the virus before it entered the market?
[00:38:37.099 --> 00:38:39.441]  If not, please say it clearly.
[00:38:39.761 --> 00:38:43.523]  If yes, are you willing to share the data with this committee?
[00:38:44.344 --> 00:38:48.506]  And I really want a straight answer, yes or no, and I'm looking forward to it.
[00:38:48.646 --> 00:38:49.247]  Thank you very much.
[00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:57.215]  Regarding the question around, did we know about stopping humanisation before it's entered the market?
[00:38:59.457 --> 00:38:59.597]  No!
[00:38:59.757 --> 00:39:04.861]  We had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market.
[00:39:05.782 --> 00:39:06.903]  This is scandalous.
[00:39:07.463 --> 00:39:14.467]   Millions of people worldwide felt forced to get vaccinated because of the myth That you do it for others.
[00:39:15.208 --> 00:39:17.708]  Now this turned out to be a cheap lie.
[00:39:18.308 --> 00:39:19.288]  This should be exposed.
[00:39:19.669 --> 00:39:21.249]  Please share this video.
[00:39:22.189 --> 00:39:23.869]  The speed of science.
[00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:26.210]  We own the science.
[00:39:26.250 --> 00:39:27.090]  We are the science.
[00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:28.530]  Science is all about questioning.
[00:39:29.091 --> 00:39:30.611]  And science that's real is slow.
[00:39:33.352 --> 00:39:35.252]  But notice the arrogance of these monsters.
[00:39:36.499 --> 00:39:38.840]  Yes, Miss Small truly has a small soul.
[00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:45.342]  Now here is one of the top scientists and respected doctors in Australia.
[00:39:46.022 --> 00:39:47.763]  For decades he's been a big pundit on TV.
[00:39:48.183 --> 00:39:49.803]  He came out two years ago and guess what's happening?
[00:39:49.823 --> 00:39:50.483]  He's been proven right.
[00:39:51.264 --> 00:39:56.886]  Saying 20 million dead worldwide from the jab, 2.2 billion injured worldwide.
[00:39:57.246 --> 00:39:58.666]  This clip is beyond critical.
[00:39:58.686 --> 00:40:11.989]   One of the big pieces of news over the last couple of days has been A substack by a gentleman called Peter Halligan.
[00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:30.005]  Peter Halligan has been looking, he's a most experienced analyst in the financial industry, extremely used to looking at statistics and translating them into a summary statement.
[00:40:30.982 --> 00:40:41.467]  And this is the summary statement, and I hope your leaders are sitting down, holding themselves, because what I'm going to tell you intuitively sounds ridiculous.
[00:40:42.308 --> 00:40:45.989]  That's why it's so incredibly important that I say this.
[00:40:47.710 --> 00:41:09.627]   These numbers are best estimates at this point in time, using government data for the global consequences of the clout shot, In terms of death and morbidity, otherwise known as serious adverse events such as heart attack, strokes, pulmonary emboli, etc.
[00:41:11.008 --> 00:41:16.209]  We've been focusing for good reason on North American statistics during the last two and a half years.
[00:41:17.269 --> 00:41:26.431]  But this man has extrapolated that into the total effect, negative effect, of the clock shot.
[00:41:26.531 --> 00:41:28.512]  And these are the numbers.
[00:41:31.374 --> 00:41:39.017]  Deaths, global deaths, directly attributable to the vaccine.
[00:41:39.037 --> 00:41:48.321]  20 million, two zero million deaths due to the clot shot.
[00:41:50.282 --> 00:41:58.666]  And two billion, big B, two billion serious adverse reactions of the type I described.
[00:42:00.359 --> 00:42:02.740]  Now, these numbers are beyond staggering.
[00:42:05.201 --> 00:42:20.488]  To contrast that with history, vaccines have typically been pulled from the market when the last one, the bird flu vaccine, was pulled with only 35 deaths.
[00:42:22.929 --> 00:42:27.351]  I hope people can appreciate the scale of what is going on here.
[00:42:28.152 --> 00:43:01.409]   an unimaginable carnage which isn't over because that number first of all is the current estimate it does not include future deaths of a similar type which will be cumulative on top of that it does not include stillbirths It does not include those avoidable deaths due to having had a one-disease healthcare system for two and a half years, with people not being treated or investigated for cancer or treated for cancer, for example.
[00:43:01.749 --> 00:43:02.990]  Those numbers are not included.
[00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:07.971]  The numbers from the lockdowns, the suicides, are not included.
[00:43:10.092 --> 00:43:16.652]   and also not included are the future deaths that we're anticipating from a rapid increase in the rate of cancer
[00:43:16.652 --> 00:43:23.492]   Presentations and fatal infections because of immune suppression induced by
[00:43:23.492 --> 00:43:28.471]   the clock chart those factors are in addition to
[00:43:28.471 --> 00:43:35.461]   Those jaw-dropping numbers that I just mentioned Devastating video we're gonna have it posted on the live
[00:43:35.461 --> 00:43:39.492]   show feed at Infowars.com. Just be clear. I've seen him on Australian TV
[00:43:39.532 --> 00:43:44.412]   He's a pundit in Canada UK and Australia, but he lives in Canada, Alberta. That's dr. Roger
[00:43:44.412 --> 00:43:51.612]   Hodgkinson laying out that majors report based on the studies. That's the facts. This is the biggest bio attack
[00:43:51.612 --> 00:43:54.612]   in human history This is bigger than World War two. We'll be right back

[00:45:21.278 --> 00:45:22.639]  But I can't do this without you.
[00:45:23.999 --> 00:45:37.244]  That's why I want to thank you for equipping me to be able to get in the arena with these people so that I can die on my feet instead of be a slave on my knees.
[00:45:39.385 --> 00:45:44.670]   Because We will end up living on our feet and dying on our knees.
[00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:48.953]  All right, I'm going to air a few clips here, because some stations don't care this segment.
[00:45:48.973 --> 00:45:53.697]  I'm going to come back and get the rest of the entire vaccine poison cover-up coming unraveled.
[00:45:53.737 --> 00:45:54.717]  It's just so incredible.
[00:45:55.358 --> 00:45:58.320]  We should be shooting off fireworks right now, but the criminals aren't indicted yet.
[00:45:59.041 --> 00:45:59.701]  We'll be right back.
[00:45:59.741 --> 00:46:05.005]  When you take your calls, we've got a bunch of big guests and huge news on weather control and more, the Hurricane Ian.
[00:46:05.345 --> 00:46:05.986]  It's all coming up.
[00:46:08.588 --> 00:46:09.889]  It's called the Great Reset.
[00:46:10.706 --> 00:46:11.166]  Tough guy.
[00:46:12.387 --> 00:46:13.467]  It's called the New World Order.
[00:46:13.527 --> 00:46:23.530]  It's called the big banks wanting to squeeze the economy and make people poor so they can loan us fiat money to take control of our lives with a social credit score and a universal basic income.
[00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:24.631]  That's everything.
[00:46:24.911 --> 00:46:26.731]  That's the whole future of our lives.
[00:46:27.011 --> 00:46:32.273]  The whole world's gonna be about surveillance and control and them manipulating and tracking everything you do.
[00:46:32.293 --> 00:46:33.814]  It's all being officially announced.
[00:46:33.834 --> 00:46:35.234]  I've got articles everywhere.
[00:46:35.294 --> 00:46:37.355]  There are press releases saying it!
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:44.786]  And then the crew asked me during the break, they go, Are you alright?
[00:46:44.806 --> 00:46:46.047]  You really seem upset.
[00:46:46.168 --> 00:46:47.650]  Are you feeling okay?
[00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:50.353]  They're gonna starve a couple hundred million people to death.
[00:46:50.373 --> 00:46:51.675]  Yeah, I'm pretty freaked out.
[00:46:51.715 --> 00:46:52.717]  Yeah, this is real.
[00:46:53.798 --> 00:46:56.902]  This is not a freaking game to me, man.
[00:47:00.715 --> 00:47:36.732]   I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I- Once again, not for the first time, what had seemed like a nutty conspiracy theory turned out to be the truth.
[00:47:36.752 --> 00:47:37.552]  Yeah, I'm upset.
[00:47:37.572 --> 00:47:39.873]  I'm really... I told you last night.
[00:47:39.894 --> 00:47:41.034]  I said, what's wrong with you?
[00:47:41.274 --> 00:47:42.095]  You really freaked out.
[00:47:42.155 --> 00:47:43.536]  I'm like, yeah, I'm really freaked out.
[00:47:43.716 --> 00:47:45.217]  I'm really freaked out.
[00:47:45.457 --> 00:47:46.898]  I'm really freaked out.
[00:47:46.958 --> 00:47:48.359]  You see, because this is real.
[00:47:49.139 --> 00:47:52.802]  The supply chain being cut off, the energy grid being cut off is real.
[00:47:55.859 --> 00:47:58.922]  And we're going into a time now where we're not going to be on the air.
[00:47:59.022 --> 00:48:08.810]  I mean, if we don't back this off, if we don't get sane people to stop the globalists... I mean... We won't be here in six months.
[00:48:09.171 --> 00:48:16.197]  You won't be here in six months.
[00:48:17.137 --> 00:48:20.320]  Who is the most banned news network in the world?
[00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:22.782]  InfoWars.com InfoWars comes to mind.
[00:48:22.922 --> 00:48:25.149]   InfoWars.com InfoWars.
[00:48:25.169 --> 00:48:26.130]  You watch InfoWars?
[00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:27.190]  InfoWars.
[00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:29.470]  It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[00:48:29.651 --> 00:48:30.251]  Alex Jones.
[00:48:30.311 --> 00:48:30.831]  Nice guy.
[00:48:30.871 --> 00:48:33.412]  You must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[00:48:33.572 --> 00:48:34.192]  Alex Jones.
[00:48:35.892 --> 00:48:36.593]  Alex Jones.
[00:48:36.693 --> 00:48:37.333]  Alex Jones.
[00:48:37.433 --> 00:48:38.613]  Alex Jones is the greatest.
[00:48:38.693 --> 00:48:39.693]  He knows who InfoWars is.
[00:48:39.713 --> 00:48:40.934]  Quit playing this joke over here.
[00:48:41.094 --> 00:48:42.474]  That's why the deplatforming didn't work.
[00:48:42.594 --> 00:48:45.935]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:48:45.815 --> 00:48:48.815]  You need to listen to Alex Jones.
[00:48:48.815 --> 00:48:51.815]  [Music]
[00:48:52.815 --> 00:48:55.815]  [Music]
[00:49:20.815 --> 00:49:23.815]  [Music]
[00:49:23.815 --> 00:49:44.815]   I want listeners to know this as we enter the second hour today.
[00:49:44.599 --> 00:49:46.121]  We're going live until midnight tonight.
[00:49:46.661 --> 00:49:47.882]  Special emergency broadcast.
[00:49:47.902 --> 00:49:48.702]  Be part of the victory.
[00:49:49.083 --> 00:49:49.523]  Share the links.
[00:49:49.603 --> 00:49:51.224]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:49:53.386 --> 00:49:59.150]  That I do not come to you with positive news just to jack you up and tell you we're winning.
[00:50:01.172 --> 00:50:02.192]  I've been on there 28 years.
[00:50:02.252 --> 00:50:05.395]  People know when we're down and we're losing, I will tell you.
[00:50:05.435 --> 00:50:06.315]  And you don't need me to tell you.
[00:50:06.335 --> 00:50:06.896]  You can see it too.
[00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:10.391]  But let me just tell you, and I'm getting chills right now.
[00:50:10.792 --> 00:50:12.012]  We are winning.
[00:50:12.373 --> 00:50:15.275]  We are running the tables on the enemies of humanity.
[00:50:15.415 --> 00:50:16.496]  Steve Bannon is totally right.
[00:50:16.816 --> 00:50:17.636]  Here's the problem.
[00:50:18.317 --> 00:50:19.518]  And you know what I'm about to say.
[00:50:19.538 --> 00:50:20.919]  It's got massive chills again.
[00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:23.640]  Before I tell you.
[00:50:25.722 --> 00:50:28.424]  Satan and his minions are going to throw everything they've got at us.
[00:50:29.445 --> 00:50:29.865]  Big time.
[00:50:31.493 --> 00:50:34.315]  But if you just joined us, the wheels are coming off.
[00:50:34.975 --> 00:50:36.756]  They lied and said the vaccine would protect you.
[00:50:37.117 --> 00:50:37.557]  It wouldn't.
[00:50:37.757 --> 00:50:38.437]  They're criminals.
[00:50:38.497 --> 00:50:44.341]  They knew what they were doing as part of a larger plan to wire us up for nanotech and to be manipulated by electromagnetic energy.
[00:50:44.381 --> 00:50:45.202]  All the patents are there.
[00:50:45.242 --> 00:50:45.942]  It's all coming out.
[00:50:46.583 --> 00:50:51.986]  But they just had huge hearings that are ongoing this week in the European Union Parliament, and they are annihilating them.
[00:50:52.987 --> 00:50:55.468]  So let's go to some of these clips.
[00:50:57.049 --> 00:51:04.111]   This is Absolute fire from a member of the European Union Parliament, Christine Terras.
[00:51:05.231 --> 00:51:06.312]  Several clips of her.
[00:51:07.692 --> 00:51:19.998]  Then we're going to also play some other clips from Christine Anderson about what's happening as it comes out that they premeditatedly lied and committed mass murder.
[00:51:20.499 --> 00:51:23.440]  And the politicians that took the money and went along with it, they're guilty as well.
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:26.642]  I love this new meme going out on Twitter.
[00:51:27.833 --> 00:51:30.114]  For TV viewers, you can see it, it's from James Rooney.
[00:51:30.715 --> 00:51:33.376]  How quickly does the speed of science get you here?
[00:51:33.396 --> 00:51:34.797]  Because that's what they said.
[00:51:34.857 --> 00:51:38.459]  Yeah, the speed of science is, we don't ask questions, we put in you what we want.
[00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:40.460]  How quick does it get you to Nuremberg 2.0?
[00:51:42.101 --> 00:51:43.262]  So here's the clubs back to back.
[00:51:43.962 --> 00:52:09.190]   Yesterday, when one of my colleagues asked if they tested, in this case Pfizer, if Pfizer tested If their medical product is stopping the spread of the virus, we were shocked to find out yesterday that they haven't tested their vaccine to see if it's stopping the spread of the virus.
[00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:26.940]   So we are now more than a year after the green certificate, the digital green certificate was imposed in the European Union and people were forced To be vaccinated with a medical product in order to exercise their basic fundamental rights, and they were told and we were told.
[00:52:27.641 --> 00:52:32.786]  We were voted against the green certificate, but many of our colleagues voted in favor of it.
[00:52:33.887 --> 00:52:36.169]  Because they believe what these companies have said.
[00:52:37.570 --> 00:52:41.133]  That if you get vaccinated, you will not be infected.
[00:52:42.219 --> 00:52:43.420]  And you will not spread the virus.
[00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:49.763]  They even ran a campaign and said, get vaccinated in order to keep your grandmother and your parents healthy.
[00:52:50.884 --> 00:53:05.832]  And we find out now, after more than a year, that when they requested the special marketing authorization, they haven't tested the vaccine to see if it's stopping the spread of the virus.
[00:53:07.132 --> 00:53:11.609]   So I'm asking again, and we are asking again, What are they going to hide?
[00:53:11.929 --> 00:53:12.970]  What do they hide exactly?
[00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:17.511]  Why aren't they transparent with their medical product?
[00:53:17.531 --> 00:53:20.412]  We heard yesterday, I mean it was, I was shocked.
[00:53:22.012 --> 00:53:28.254]  Because Pfizer used this opportunity just to do a PR campaign and even lecture us.
[00:53:28.314 --> 00:53:30.275]  Why are we asking this and not asking that?
[00:53:30.395 --> 00:53:31.735]  Who are they to question us?
[00:53:31.795 --> 00:53:33.276]  What kind of questions do we ask?
[00:53:35.376 --> 00:53:37.677]  We are elected by the people for the people, not they.
[00:53:39.418 --> 00:53:42.620]  They are supposed to answer all these questions, which they have not.
[00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:44.801]  I cannot hide my shock.
[00:53:46.041 --> 00:53:53.705]  And, you know, nobody answered concrete questions that all of my colleagues asked.
[00:53:55.265 --> 00:54:05.610]  We heard allegations here and statements from the representative of Pfizer stating, and I quote, that they cannot release the contracts because they have certain interests.
[00:54:06.150 --> 00:54:07.511]  What about the interests of the people?
[00:54:08.297 --> 00:54:09.158]  What about their health?
[00:54:10.058 --> 00:54:14.821]  Because it's our authority and our job to make sure that we get to the bottom of this.
[00:54:15.461 --> 00:54:19.724]  So the first question that I address to you is the following.
[00:54:20.685 --> 00:54:21.365]  Just yes or no.
[00:54:22.026 --> 00:54:29.110]  When exactly are you going to fully publish the contract that you signed between Pfizer and the European Commission?
[00:54:29.810 --> 00:54:30.531]  Hi, my shock.
[00:54:31.772 --> 00:54:35.634]  And, you know, nobody answered.
[00:54:36.286 --> 00:54:39.408]  Concrete questions that all of my colleagues asked.
[00:54:40.989 --> 00:54:51.295]  We heard allegations here and statements from the representative of Pfizer stating, and I quote, that they cannot release the contracts because they have certain interests.
[00:54:51.875 --> 00:54:53.256]  What about the interests of the people?
[00:54:54.016 --> 00:54:54.897]  What about their health?
[00:54:55.777 --> 00:55:00.560]  Because it's our authority and our job to make sure that we get to the bottom of this.
[00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:05.383]  So the first question that I address to you is the following.
[00:55:06.391 --> 00:55:07.052]  Just yes or no.
[00:55:07.732 --> 00:55:14.737]  When exactly are you going to fully publish the contracts that you signed between Pfizer and the European Commission?
[00:55:14.877 --> 00:55:27.525]  The fact that Mr. Bourla, CEO of Pfizer, had the audacity to refuse to appear in front of this committee to answer questions constitutes a gross disregard for the people whose tax money he took, by the way.
[00:55:27.965 --> 00:55:34.390]  If we cannot compel a crucial player to appear in front of this committee, then this committee is useless.
[00:55:34.930 --> 00:55:45.174]  So I propose that we declare ourselves incompetent, and I furthermore propose that this committee concludes the need for a committee of inquiry.
[00:55:45.194 --> 00:55:48.955]  Alright, so the criminal investigations are off, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:49.631 --> 00:55:56.537]  Here is a short compilation of the dramatic evolution of Pfizer CEO's position on whether the vaccine stops transmission.
[00:55:57.097 --> 00:56:04.943]  Indications right now that are telling us that there is a protection against transmission of the disease.
[00:56:05.304 --> 00:56:09.627]  There is no variant that we have identified that escapes the protection of our vaccine.
[00:56:09.887 --> 00:56:12.390]  And we know that the two doses of the vaccine offer very limited protection, if any.
[00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:16.210]   effectiveness, you know, personally makes me a lot very proud about it.
[00:56:16.210 --> 00:56:21.210]   And we know that the three, the two doses of the vaccine offer very limited protection,
[00:56:21.210 --> 00:56:27.010]   if any. The three doses with a booster, they offer reasonable protection against.
[00:56:27.127 --> 00:56:30.450]  It is necessary a fourth boost right now.
[00:56:30.790 --> 00:56:38.418]  The protection that you are getting from the third, it is good enough, actually quite good for hospitalizations and deaths.
[00:56:38.598 --> 00:56:41.121]  It's not that good against infections, but doesn't last.
[00:56:42.847 --> 00:56:45.511]  Now, we're going to get more of these clips throughout the day.
[00:56:45.531 --> 00:56:47.073]  We're going live until midnight tonight.
[00:56:47.153 --> 00:56:48.555]  But I'm going to tell the crew now, I forgot to tell you.
[00:56:49.096 --> 00:56:51.279]  Guys, he was on CBS and NBC.
[00:56:51.599 --> 00:56:52.500]  There's a clip I remember.
[00:56:52.981 --> 00:56:59.751]  Two years ago, before they rolled out the poison shots, master criminals like Bill Gates want to tell you up front how they're going to rape you and kill you.
[00:57:00.871 --> 00:57:06.493]  So he went on TV and he said, well, we know the first shot's not going to work and the second really won't.
[00:57:06.933 --> 00:57:10.575]  It'll take three or four shots and you'll probably need a few shots a year.
[00:57:11.275 --> 00:57:12.275]  That was the business model.
[00:57:12.455 --> 00:57:14.116]  And we told you folks, it's not going to work.
[00:57:14.516 --> 00:57:17.757]  It's going to erase your immune system because in their own documents they were admitting it.
[00:57:17.797 --> 00:57:22.059]  It was a business plan and they've erased the immune systems of these people that took it.
[00:57:22.339 --> 00:57:25.080]  The numbers are out in big studies all over Europe, all over the US.
[00:57:26.638 --> 00:57:31.380]  Young people that took the shot suddenly are super sick and the hospitals are saying they have no immune system.
[00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:35.002]  It's like they have AIDS, but they don't test positive.
[00:57:35.642 --> 00:57:36.683]  They have VAIDS.
[00:57:37.523 --> 00:57:41.045]  Vaccine Induced Autoimmune Deficiency Syndrome.
[00:57:43.550 --> 00:57:58.796]  And isn't it funny that in Australia they had to pull their main vaccine because it was giving false positives for HIV because the spike protein is from the HIV virus that Fauci cooked up in the late 70s and rolled out in the 80s.
[00:58:00.656 --> 00:58:01.677]  Oh, they've done this before.
[00:58:02.317 --> 00:58:03.977]  And HIV was their beta test.
[00:58:05.258 --> 00:58:08.559]  Now they've given you COVID and God knows what the next parts of it are.
[00:58:08.579 --> 00:58:10.820]  Because the side effects are 20 million dead.
[00:58:12.022 --> 00:58:13.884]  They got a long-term goal to kill you slow.
[00:58:13.904 --> 00:58:15.646]  It was a little too strong though.
[00:58:15.986 --> 00:58:18.469]  A little too obvious what they did.
[00:58:18.489 --> 00:58:21.672]  So I've got all this other news and all this other stuff to cover.
[00:58:22.573 --> 00:58:23.974]  Massive nuclear war news.
[00:58:24.174 --> 00:58:26.317]  Massive transgender pedophile news.
[00:58:26.877 --> 00:58:30.921]  Massive news on so many fronts today.
[00:58:31.962 --> 00:58:33.204]  And yes, we're going to open the phones up.
[00:58:33.224 --> 00:58:35.206]  I'm going to give the number out when we come back as well.
[00:58:36.533 --> 00:58:40.835]  Please remember, we're in the middle of a special 16-hour broadcast, 8 a.m.
[00:58:41.235 --> 00:58:42.335]  to midnight tonight.
[00:58:42.916 --> 00:58:45.617]  I'm gonna be up here tonight, 6 to midnight, with Owen Schroer.
[00:58:46.217 --> 00:58:58.009]   We've got everybody joining us, a bunch of big guests, Steve Quayle, Robert Barnes, I'm getting back on, we've got Passio coming on.
[00:58:58.489 --> 00:59:00.131]  So many others tonight.
[00:59:00.251 --> 00:59:02.633]  Big guest on The War Room today, 3 p.m.
[00:59:02.653 --> 00:59:03.034]  Central.
[00:59:03.574 --> 00:59:05.856]  And again, this is a war of information.
[00:59:06.177 --> 00:59:07.778]  They're counting on you not taking action.
[00:59:07.798 --> 00:59:11.281]  You saw those members of Parliament in the EU saying, share this link.
[00:59:11.322 --> 00:59:11.842]  We're in a war.
[00:59:11.862 --> 00:59:12.623]  We're in an info war.
[00:59:12.943 --> 00:59:13.464]  Share the links.
[00:59:13.524 --> 00:59:15.065]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:59:15.485 --> 00:59:17.487]  The big link's the front page of Infowars.com.
[00:59:17.748 --> 00:59:18.228]  We'll be right back.
[00:59:18.248 --> 00:59:18.588]  Stay with us.
[00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:22.072]  Okay, I want to give the number out.
[00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:28.312]  And we will take calls until about 15 minutes to the next hour with a very special guest.
[00:59:28.732 --> 00:59:35.034]  It's an expert on Russia and more that will have as a surprise for you when they join us.
[00:59:36.834 --> 00:59:38.595]  Again, thank you for tuning in today.
[00:59:38.615 --> 00:59:39.575]  I really appreciate you.
[00:59:40.635 --> 00:59:42.936]  As you can see, we've not been playing games the last 28 years.
[00:59:42.956 --> 00:59:43.956]  We know what we're talking about.
[00:59:44.917 --> 00:59:48.678]  And we can stop these people, but we've got to get serious and we've got to have courage.
[00:59:49.679 --> 00:59:54.603]  Again, I didn't want to call for the arrest and conviction and execution of the globalists last hour.
[00:59:54.803 --> 00:59:58.846]  When you do that, they flip a little switch and send folks to kill you or put you in prison.
[00:59:58.886 --> 01:00:00.267]  But I've just got to do it as a man.
[01:00:00.947 --> 01:00:01.788]  It's what they deserve.
[01:00:02.308 --> 01:00:03.469]  But nobody should shoot them.
[01:00:03.509 --> 01:00:04.930]  Nobody should bomb them.
[01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:07.832]  We should take our governments back by exposing them in the Infowar.
[01:00:08.192 --> 01:00:14.497]  But they need to know that in the end, they'll be Nuremberg 2 and they will hang on international television.
[01:00:15.217 --> 01:00:15.437]  Alright?
[01:00:15.838 --> 01:00:16.678]  Can I stand by that?
[01:00:17.059 --> 01:00:17.800]  They want to kill us?
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:23.345]  Well, the children don't deserve to be forcibly injected with stuff that erases their immune system and get some heart attacks.
[01:00:23.385 --> 01:00:27.789]  And God's watching, and if I don't call for that, God doesn't like me.
[01:00:28.469 --> 01:00:29.210]  That's my boss.
[01:00:29.791 --> 01:00:31.872]  God's pleased with me right now, I can feel it.
[01:00:32.673 --> 01:00:37.297]  And I'm given more discernment, I'm given more closeness to God, the more I do the right thing.
[01:00:37.738 --> 01:00:39.499]  And you dumbass Satanists don't get that.
[01:00:40.247 --> 01:00:46.532]  But when you follow natural law and you get behind God's directives, through free will, the universe is yours.
[01:00:48.754 --> 01:00:52.136]  I will not aid and abet mass murderers when I know what they're doing.
[01:00:52.917 --> 01:00:55.879]  And going 50% against them is cowardly.
[01:00:56.199 --> 01:00:58.081]  Going 90% against them is cowardly.
[01:00:58.721 --> 01:01:01.383]  God wants 100% total resistance!
[01:01:01.443 --> 01:01:08.443]  percent resistance. Period.
[01:01:08.443 --> 01:01:15.443]  100 total commitment percent.
[01:01:16.119 --> 01:01:17.060]  That's what God wants.
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:21.062]  And all you're missing out on is infinity by not doing it.
[01:01:22.983 --> 01:01:25.065]  It's like winning the lottery times a trillion.
[01:01:25.345 --> 01:01:26.726]  You want to fight evil.
[01:01:26.986 --> 01:01:28.127]  You want to stand up.
[01:01:28.387 --> 01:01:30.108]  You want to step into who you are.
[01:01:30.348 --> 01:01:39.254]  Then all the secrets that are in your genetics that activate and connect to your soul and the real control panel of the universe will be given to you.
[01:01:40.023 --> 01:01:52.931]  And then you'll throw down your crowns, like Revelation says, when God gives us the crowns, which is the symbol of enlightenment, we'll throw them at God's feet saying, we do not want credit, we just want to be in your presence.
[01:01:54.092 --> 01:02:02.337]  Because the presence, being in the presence of the Almighty, is unspeakable.
[01:02:03.277 --> 01:02:04.378]  Infinity better.
[01:02:05.814 --> 01:02:14.017]  Then watching a beautiful sunset, or the best orgasm, or when you're in a fight and the bully starts it and you knock him down and they hit the ground and you feel that feeling of exhilaration.
[01:02:14.457 --> 01:02:23.700]  Imagine something trillions of times better, unspeakably better, than your greatest victories, than your greatest exhilarations.
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:30.342]  It's so incredible that your mouth's hanging open because it's over.
[01:02:30.822 --> 01:02:31.443]  You're done.
[01:02:31.543 --> 01:02:32.123]  You're with God.
[01:02:35.464 --> 01:02:38.427]  And you don't understand, why doesn't everybody want this?
[01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:44.111]  And that's the big mystery, isn't it?
[01:02:48.935 --> 01:02:53.899]  Because God doesn't just give you that enlightenment, and that connection to infinity, easily.
[01:02:56.321 --> 01:03:02.607]  It's like the cheesy Empire Strikes Back, where Luke Skywalker asks Yoda, is the dark side stronger?
[01:03:04.978 --> 01:03:05.659]  Yoda says no.
[01:03:05.679 --> 01:03:07.120]  It's quicker.
[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:08.801]  It's easier.
[01:03:08.821 --> 01:03:11.423]  It's more seductive.
[01:03:13.465 --> 01:03:15.266]  But it's not powerful at all.
[01:03:17.348 --> 01:03:18.629]  Obi-Wan Kenobi says to Darth Vader.
[01:03:23.112 --> 01:03:24.834]  He says the circle is now complete.
[01:03:26.235 --> 01:03:28.036]  When I left you I was but the learner.
[01:03:28.517 --> 01:03:29.958]  Now I am the master.
[01:03:32.751 --> 01:03:35.952]  And Obi-Wan Kenobi says, only a master of evil, Darth.
[01:03:38.293 --> 01:03:46.132]   If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
[01:03:46.132 --> 01:03:55.012]  So I don't have a death wish, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:55.150 --> 01:03:56.290]  I don't want to go to prison.
[01:03:56.330 --> 01:03:57.070]  I don't want to be killed.
[01:03:57.310 --> 01:03:59.891]  I want to be here for my wife and my family and my children and you.
[01:04:00.331 --> 01:04:07.073]  But it's no choice at all that I will never sell out.
[01:04:07.553 --> 01:04:09.433]  It's not possible!
[01:04:12.554 --> 01:04:15.715]  Because I have been shown infinity!
[01:04:19.796 --> 01:04:23.904]   About a year ago, And I've been praying.
[01:04:26.866 --> 01:04:28.027]  And I was saying to God, I'm weak.
[01:04:29.308 --> 01:04:31.009]  And please just give me the strength to be strong.
[01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:34.852]  I said, I know you're a free will God, but you just take me over.
[01:04:35.632 --> 01:04:36.693]  You just turn me into a machine.
[01:04:37.053 --> 01:04:38.334]  I just, I don't want to feel anything.
[01:04:38.354 --> 01:04:40.676]  And I went to bed that night.
[01:04:43.799 --> 01:04:45.800]  And it was like a hundred lifetimes.
[01:04:47.361 --> 01:04:48.102]  I was taken away.
[01:04:51.144 --> 01:05:01.108]  And up there, it's the best way to describe it, up there, the direction doesn't matter, but there, it was just like, this is what we're doing.
[01:05:01.128 --> 01:05:02.208]  This is what's going to happen.
[01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:04.429]  But you've got to make the choice.
[01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:07.430]  And I said, but I want to know the New World Order.
[01:05:07.450 --> 01:05:08.251]  I want to know why they do it.
[01:05:08.291 --> 01:05:12.052]  And God said, you don't want to know, but here, would you like to look?
[01:05:14.533 --> 01:05:26.939]   And I spent lifetimes Digging through other civilizations and our own and just seeing the mind of the enemy and how pathetic it was.
[01:05:27.199 --> 01:05:38.467]  And it was always old men in these tombs just playing with sand through their hands and groping and trying to control populations and people when they never had a chance to do it.
[01:05:38.507 --> 01:05:50.185]   It was just, it was so, so powerful that I came back out of that Those tombs of civilizations and free worlds and all the people that sold out to Satan.
[01:05:50.785 --> 01:05:55.189]  And I said, I feel total absolution.
[01:05:55.209 --> 01:05:56.370]  I want to stay here.
[01:05:58.412 --> 01:05:59.132]  And it was, no.
[01:05:58.952 --> 01:06:08.231]  No, that's not what's going to happen.
[01:06:08.231 --> 01:06:10.871]  But just know this is waiting.
[01:06:10.822 --> 01:06:19.813]   And just like that, Going into that time continuum, went in reverse, through the portal, out, and back into my body.
[01:06:21.734 --> 01:06:28.500]  And I woke up, and just, I was just like, it was, nothing is even as scrabble.
[01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:31.663]  And I remember praying again and again, please let me see that again.
[01:06:32.504 --> 01:06:34.504]  Please take me back again.
[01:06:34.504 --> 01:06:44.504]   And the message was, no, instead of that, let's show you what's going on other places.
[01:06:44.504 --> 01:06:54.504]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:06:45.765 --> 01:06:50.987]  So that you're willing to fight for consciousness and free will in the multiverse.
[01:06:52.387 --> 01:06:54.588]  And let's just show you the other side.
[01:06:56.468 --> 01:07:07.552]  And then I've been shown the postgame film reels of not just what's happened in other places, but what's going to happen here.
[01:07:08.487 --> 01:07:10.428]  And let me tell you, it ain't pretty.
[01:07:12.709 --> 01:07:19.872]  It was in March of this year that I was sitting at a table in a gilded hall with a very famous billionaire.
[01:07:21.193 --> 01:07:32.297]  We were sitting around with all these professors and scientists and military experts, debating what would happen with Putin's war in the Ukraine, or Soros's war, it should be called.
[01:07:33.798 --> 01:07:35.579]  And we had a three-hour dinner.
[01:07:36.812 --> 01:07:40.155]  And I said the danger will be when Putin is defeated by NATO forces.
[01:07:40.815 --> 01:07:41.756]  He's walked into a trap.
[01:07:43.918 --> 01:07:48.241]  And then it will be the threat of nuclear war and they'll start cutting off the pipelines.
[01:07:48.681 --> 01:07:51.143]  They use that as the pretext for the cover for the economic collapse.
[01:07:51.564 --> 01:07:53.625]  They've already initiated with the COVID tyranny rollout.
[01:07:56.848 --> 01:08:00.231]  And one of the other well known people that was there, who I respect and I like.
[01:08:02.472 --> 01:08:03.133]  Won't say his name.
[01:08:05.285 --> 01:08:06.926]  He said, Alex, Putin's gonna win.
[01:08:06.946 --> 01:08:12.147]  I said, nobody wins in nuclear war.
[01:08:17.109 --> 01:08:19.909]  Now, I don't tell you that story to hype myself up or anything.
[01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.890]  It's not that.
[01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:24.171]  It's that these are the real discussions that are going on.
[01:08:28.912 --> 01:08:31.333]  And these are the things that we should take very seriously.
[01:08:33.530 --> 01:08:42.579]  And in that same meeting and in other meetings I had subsequently with other Bilderberg attendees, the discussion was, should we evacuate?
[01:08:42.599 --> 01:08:48.486]  And I'm not with these people, but should we evacuate the Southern Hemisphere and where best to go?
[01:08:48.826 --> 01:08:51.469]  And now a lot of those people have gone to the Southern Hemisphere.
[01:08:52.955 --> 01:08:56.618]  So let me just put that out there as where we are right now.
[01:08:57.238 --> 01:09:08.967]  We're taking your calls, first-time callers, on World War III, on the massive vaccine poison news coming out, on anything you want to discuss, any topic, just be a first-time caller and have a clear telephone line and ready to make your point.
[01:09:09.287 --> 01:09:10.028]  I'd love to hear from you.
[01:09:10.248 --> 01:09:11.069]  That way we get to everybody.
[01:09:11.089 --> 01:09:11.909]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:11.929 --> 01:09:12.129]  877-789-Alex.
[01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:12.450]  There it is.
[01:09:12.270 --> 01:09:27.270]   877-789-2539. 877-789-Alex. There it is. 877-789-2539. But that's how serious this is.
[01:09:27.353 --> 01:09:29.354]  The end of the global currency being the dollar.
[01:09:30.394 --> 01:09:31.315]  A new global currency.
[01:09:31.755 --> 01:09:33.456]  We're at the crossroads right now.
[01:09:36.337 --> 01:09:41.339]  And if you study history, any crossroads has war as the main ingredient.
[01:09:44.300 --> 01:09:54.965]  Now, if I just cared about my skin, I would be in the middle of Montana or Wyoming right now, in a shack with my wife and children.
[01:09:56.542 --> 01:09:58.643]  Most of my children are grown up now and I'm old.
[01:09:59.983 --> 01:10:00.684]  It's crazy.
[01:10:00.944 --> 01:10:04.505]  Three-year-old children are grown up, but my younger daughter's five.
[01:10:06.186 --> 01:10:07.146]  Sweet little Veronica.
[01:10:09.267 --> 01:10:13.889]  And I have a fleshly anger at myself every day that I haven't evacuated.
[01:10:17.250 --> 01:10:20.751]  But I'm not going to wait in the Southern Hemisphere and hope this doesn't happen.
[01:10:21.011 --> 01:10:22.852]  I'm not going to run off to Wyoming or Montana.
[01:10:23.712 --> 01:10:32.433]   I'm going to stay at the helm and bet My daughter, and my name, and my children on this, because I think we can stop this together.
[01:10:32.493 --> 01:10:39.372]   But if you don't realize how much danger we're in, and if you don't internalize that,
[01:10:39.372 --> 01:10:48.653]   and then externalize your prayer to God to stop this, and your political, corporate, financial, historical,
[01:10:48.653 --> 01:10:53.372]  human action against it, you are insane.
[01:10:53.372 --> 01:11:03.053]   We've all been in God's presence, whether we like it or not, whether we admit it or not,
[01:11:03.053 --> 01:11:05.612]  but I've really been in God's presence.
[01:11:05.612 --> 01:11:15.612]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:11:07.037 --> 01:11:09.079]  And I can tell you, I have absolution.
[01:11:09.399 --> 01:11:10.000]  I know it's real.
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:11.461]  It gives me great strength.
[01:11:12.001 --> 01:11:15.024]  But I still love my family, and I still want to save the planet.
[01:11:15.304 --> 01:11:16.325]  And God wants that too.
[01:11:16.585 --> 01:11:18.927]  God wants to test us and see what we'll do under stress.
[01:11:19.448 --> 01:11:20.068]  What we'll do.
[01:11:20.949 --> 01:11:22.991]  This isn't a fake simulation in some computer.
[01:11:23.191 --> 01:11:31.278]  This is real planet, real rocks, real trees, real fish, real birds, real people, real weapons, real decisions.
[01:11:34.249 --> 01:11:35.830]  Yeah, Big Tech's got their metaverse.
[01:11:35.890 --> 01:11:36.990]  God's got the universe.
[01:11:38.711 --> 01:11:39.291]  Hear that quote?
[01:11:40.052 --> 01:11:41.672]  Big Tech's got their metaverse.
[01:11:42.413 --> 01:11:44.154]  God's got the multiverse.
[01:11:48.335 --> 01:11:49.156]  Yeah, it's a big club.
[01:11:49.196 --> 01:11:49.716]  We ain't in it.
[01:11:49.836 --> 01:11:50.036]  Good.
[01:11:50.056 --> 01:11:51.577]  We don't want to be in your satanic club.
[01:11:55.619 --> 01:11:59.801]  Tove and Drew and Rick and Believer, your calls are coming up.
[01:12:01.561 --> 01:12:02.422]  But let's hit some of these.
[01:12:04.076 --> 01:12:06.817]  Headlines here as we see revelation fulfilled.
[01:12:09.199 --> 01:12:10.139]  Almost like it's scripted.
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:12.960]  Almost like it's a play.
[01:12:14.181 --> 01:12:19.724]  Be ready for nuclear war if Russian army collapses.
[01:12:22.325 --> 01:12:30.189]  That's what the head of the British military said and that's exactly what I said in March in that room with a bunch of billionaires.
[01:12:32.677 --> 01:12:33.617]  I said a billionaire.
[01:12:33.657 --> 01:12:34.497]  It was a bunch of billionaires.
[01:12:38.038 --> 01:12:40.139]  And I was there because they know I've predicted the future.
[01:12:40.159 --> 01:12:40.939]  It's not hard to do.
[01:12:41.439 --> 01:12:42.579]  And they said, what do you see happening?
[01:12:42.799 --> 01:12:44.279]  And I said, Putin's going to get his ass kicked.
[01:12:44.499 --> 01:12:45.320]  He walks into a trap.
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:46.600]  Total NATO operation.
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:48.860]  I know a bunch of people personally who were there.
[01:12:50.701 --> 01:12:53.901]  The army is toe to toe with the Russians.
[01:12:54.181 --> 01:12:55.001]  We're at war with Russia.
[01:12:56.062 --> 01:12:59.602]  And I said, Putin needs to be given an exit strategy and a peace deal now.
[01:12:59.922 --> 01:13:01.223]  Let him have 10% of the country.
[01:13:01.443 --> 01:13:02.243]  This has got to stop.
[01:13:03.607 --> 01:13:04.968]  NATO aggression's got to end.
[01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:08.110]  This is out of control.
[01:13:11.213 --> 01:13:12.574]  And half the table laughed at me.
[01:13:12.614 --> 01:13:14.055]  They said, Putin's going to win.
[01:13:14.455 --> 01:13:16.477]  Putin's going to take all Ukraine by the end of the month.
[01:13:16.777 --> 01:13:18.038]  And I said, you just watch.
[01:13:18.698 --> 01:13:20.059]  Putin's going to get his ass kicked.
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:22.721]  He's up against sixth-generational warfare.
[01:13:23.002 --> 01:13:25.764]  He's up against robot drones, all satellite-directed.
[01:13:26.785 --> 01:13:33.250]   They send out one Ukrainian with three drones on their back, switchblade drones and others, Believe me, they're not showing you their best stuff.
[01:13:33.670 --> 01:13:34.551]  It goes up, U.S.
[01:13:34.591 --> 01:13:35.431]  satellite controls it.
[01:13:35.972 --> 01:13:37.132]  They tell the person where to go.
[01:13:37.593 --> 01:13:41.415]  Satellites watching the Russian tank, or the Russian troop movement, or the Russian base.
[01:13:42.296 --> 01:13:43.737]  They send in five, six humans.
[01:13:45.258 --> 01:13:47.059]  Then got robots yet to deliver it.
[01:13:48.419 --> 01:13:49.640]  They launch robot drones.
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:50.841]  They strike the targets.
[01:13:51.241 --> 01:13:52.442]  Russians can't beat that.
[01:13:53.623 --> 01:13:54.563]  The Russians will lose.
[01:13:56.405 --> 01:13:58.226]  And then, what are they gonna do?
[01:13:59.813 --> 01:14:04.398]  I gave them the same briefing I gave these globalists just six months ago.
[01:14:05.699 --> 01:14:11.586]  What are they going to do when Russia gets its ass kicked?
[01:14:12.611 --> 01:14:20.157]  The Russian hardliners that run the country are going to put a gun to Putin's head and say, if you don't win this, you're gone, buddy boy.
[01:14:20.617 --> 01:14:23.459]  And so he's going to conscript people and go to full war.
[01:14:23.819 --> 01:14:27.902]  And he's going to start using bombardment tactics against civilian targets.
[01:14:28.183 --> 01:14:29.283]  And now he's in the bigger trap.
[01:14:29.584 --> 01:14:31.705]  And now NATO publicly enters the war.
[01:14:35.408 --> 01:14:37.309]  I've told you this probably 50 times on air.
[01:14:38.150 --> 01:14:39.271]  It's not about being right.
[01:14:39.311 --> 01:14:40.792]  It's about the facts.
[01:14:43.871 --> 01:14:47.352]  That Putin's at his most dangerous once he gets his ass kicked.
[01:14:50.233 --> 01:14:55.615]  There's a Russophile thing out there, because we hate the New World Order, that Russia must be perfect and super powerful.
[01:14:56.175 --> 01:15:01.777]  Ladies and gentlemen, they've got a 1990s military up against the equivalent of Martian technology.
[01:15:03.978 --> 01:15:05.638]  They're being slaughtered by robots.
[01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:10.400]  90 billion dollars of them.
[01:15:13.416 --> 01:15:16.177]  And now the Russians know, with their General Armageddon.
[01:15:17.098 --> 01:15:17.798]  That's what his nickname.
[01:15:19.759 --> 01:15:21.940]  The only thing they can do is take over every city now.
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:24.160]  And level Kiev.
[01:15:24.661 --> 01:15:34.425]  Because as long as you leave industrial bases, or any operations, they will continue to be able to attack with unlimited force out of Poland, and out of the European Union.
[01:15:35.065 --> 01:15:44.089]   And that's the bad thing for the Russians, even if they take all of Ukraine, in total war, NATO will pump weapons in from every angle.
[01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:48.251]  What do they say in the 1980s movie war games?
[01:15:48.791 --> 01:15:50.872]  The only way to win is not to play.
[01:15:51.212 --> 01:15:53.212]  But we're already playing, aren't we?
[01:15:53.212 --> 01:16:01.612]  Putin has walked into a trap.
[01:16:01.612 --> 01:16:04.592]  [ Silence ]
[01:16:04.359 --> 01:16:05.980]  And the head of the British military is right.
[01:16:07.819 --> 01:16:11.521]  He says the big danger is when Putin loses, he'll use nuclear weapons.
[01:16:11.881 --> 01:16:20.924]  And even if Putin doesn't, now wait for it, even if Putin doesn't, the globalists are going to stage a false flag with a nuclear weapon.
[01:16:21.204 --> 01:16:24.986]  They'll probably blow up a nuclear reactor, have a huge meltdown and blame Russia.
[01:16:25.486 --> 01:16:26.486]  And then everything stops.
[01:16:26.546 --> 01:16:27.587]  You go, well, why would they want that?
[01:16:28.567 --> 01:16:30.608]  They use Hollywood and the media to control you.
[01:16:30.628 --> 01:16:31.589]  They don't care about any of that.
[01:16:32.309 --> 01:16:33.489]  The globalists want to reset.
[01:16:33.809 --> 01:16:35.190]  They want to blow up half the planet.
[01:16:36.024 --> 01:16:38.766]  They want to trick Russia into nuclear war, and it's about to happen.
[01:16:40.227 --> 01:16:43.288]  I'd give it a 50% chance in six months we're all dead.
[01:16:43.909 --> 01:16:48.291]  So get right with God, because I'm telling everybody listening right now, you're dead.
[01:16:48.832 --> 01:16:53.114]  Nuclear war is about to happen unless we wake up like Tulsi Gabbard did.
[01:16:54.555 --> 01:16:57.497]  Well, they got us saying, letting it all hang out.
[01:16:59.678 --> 01:17:00.599]  Putting it all on the line.
[01:17:02.039 --> 01:17:02.740]  Telling it like it is.
[01:17:05.796 --> 01:17:06.596]  That's what I'm doing today.
[01:17:06.616 --> 01:17:08.436]  I always try.
[01:17:09.837 --> 01:17:10.777]  But God holds me back.
[01:17:12.257 --> 01:17:13.997]  When the time's right, it's all release.
[01:17:15.118 --> 01:17:17.898]  And the last hour and 48 minutes, it's been released.
[01:17:19.118 --> 01:17:20.358]  You got some heavy info today.
[01:17:22.279 --> 01:17:24.339]  And believe me, world leaders are listening.
[01:17:25.399 --> 01:17:26.239]  Thought leaders are listening.
[01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:29.960]  Because what we're doing here is very special.
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.581]  And I've not just been ordained in this mission.
[01:17:34.101 --> 01:17:35.061]  You have been as well.
[01:17:36.798 --> 01:17:38.159]  So make no mistake about that.
[01:17:38.179 --> 01:17:41.100]  All right, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:42.700]  I just got into this.
[01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:43.741]  Be ready for nuclear war.
[01:17:43.861 --> 01:17:47.642]  Putin's army collapses, warns ex-NATO chief, head of the British military.
[01:17:48.182 --> 01:17:52.084]  NATO to hold nuclear deterrence, exercises Russia, rages at Ukraine.
[01:17:53.704 --> 01:17:57.286]  Biden clarifies nuclear Armageddon warning, says he didn't mean it, but that's where we're at.
[01:17:58.066 --> 01:18:02.868]  Dark days ahead for Europe as lack of Russian oil could spark worst energy crisis in decades.
[01:18:04.434 --> 01:18:10.280]  NATO once lost underwater drone under Nord Stream gas prom, now put on display.
[01:18:11.121 --> 01:18:15.665]  Who's their Ukraine commander dubbed General Armageddon for ruthless attack record?
[01:18:19.229 --> 01:18:24.975]  Mainstream media came out and said Elon Musk is having phone calls with Putin under Putin's direction.
[01:18:25.616 --> 01:18:27.057]  Musk came out and said that's totally a lie.
[01:18:27.097 --> 01:18:27.618]  Of course it is.
[01:18:29.358 --> 01:18:36.642]  Imagine five years ago when Trump was in office, I'd watch congressional hearings and they'd say, Jones is a Russian agent, and not show proof.
[01:18:37.223 --> 01:18:38.383]  That's what they do, they're liars.
[01:18:38.403 --> 01:18:40.745]  Because I don't want nuclear war with Russia, I'm a Russian agent?
[01:18:40.905 --> 01:18:41.165]  Okay.
[01:18:42.766 --> 01:18:50.930]  Let's go to your phone calls now, Drew and Tov and Believer and Nicole and Andrew and Justin and Richard and Micah, Geno and so many others.
[01:18:51.331 --> 01:18:53.512]  Drew in Texas, you're our first caller, thanks for holding.
[01:18:54.511 --> 01:18:57.413]  Hey, well, so now Tulsi Gabbard's the Russian agent.
[01:18:57.533 --> 01:19:02.355]  I read, I read that, because she bounced from sorry-ass Democratic Party.
[01:19:02.435 --> 01:19:03.355]  So she's a Russian agent.
[01:19:03.456 --> 01:19:03.776]  That's right.
[01:19:03.796 --> 01:19:05.957]  Tulsi Gabbard doesn't want nuclear war, so she's bad.
[01:19:06.897 --> 01:19:07.558]  She's bad.
[01:19:07.798 --> 01:19:11.359]  Hey, I'm gonna tell you to all the powers that be that are listening.
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:17.563]  I'm not a prophet, don't claim to be, but I do operate in the gifts of the Holy Spirit, Word of Knowledge, Word of Wisdom, whenever He enables me.
[01:19:18.143 --> 01:19:23.103]   But here's what I see happening with the people that push the vaccine, namely
[01:19:23.103 --> 01:19:24.182]  chiefly Fauci.
[01:19:24.182 --> 01:19:25.222]  I hope you're listening Fauci.
[01:19:25.222 --> 01:19:28.902]  So they're going to start rolling and dropping dimes, right?
[01:19:28.902 --> 01:19:29.943]  People are going to start snitching.
[01:19:29.943 --> 01:19:32.863]  Hey, well, they told me, oh, oh, oh, I'm innocent.
[01:19:32.863 --> 01:19:33.582]  They told me.
[01:19:33.582 --> 01:19:38.862]   I'm just going to get be the top one to go, but then time is not going to get
[01:19:38.862 --> 01:19:40.262]  time is going to end up committing suicide.
[01:19:40.262 --> 01:19:42.743]  And I hope you pray to God that he doesn't do that.
[01:19:42.500 --> 01:20:03.859]  I hope and pray that he repents.
[01:20:03.937 --> 01:20:10.741]  And I feel bad for Fauci because all he has to do is just cry out to Jesus Christ, ask God to forgive him, come clean, do your time.
[01:20:11.001 --> 01:20:12.743]  Go do your time, but don't take your life.
[01:20:12.943 --> 01:20:13.723]  Hey, y'all have a good one.
[01:20:13.763 --> 01:20:14.464]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:20:14.684 --> 01:20:15.525]  God bless you, brother.
[01:20:15.565 --> 01:20:16.285]  Appreciate you.
[01:20:16.905 --> 01:20:18.647]  Believer in Canada, you're on the air.
[01:20:18.687 --> 01:20:19.027]  Welcome.
[01:20:20.548 --> 01:20:21.028]  Hi, Alex.
[01:20:21.949 --> 01:20:23.470]  Just to know we love you.
[01:20:24.150 --> 01:20:32.536]  And I want to talk about the general overall feature of this is that it is biblical.
[01:20:33.323 --> 01:20:36.184]  It is Revelation 13 happening right now.
[01:20:37.424 --> 01:20:52.687]  And with the globalists being the beast of the sea, I'm sorry, the beast of, yes, the sea, and then the governments that they own being the false prophet or the beast of the earth.
[01:20:53.387 --> 01:20:55.628]  Anyway, I just want to point out the people.
[01:20:56.348 --> 01:20:59.689]  There is a wonderful website called revelation13.substack.com.
[01:21:02.837 --> 01:21:06.260]  And it goes verse by verse through Revelation 13.
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:15.587]  And it really does a good job at just letting people understand this is Bible prophecy happening right in front of us right now.
[01:21:15.827 --> 01:21:17.188]  And it's happening a hundred percent.
[01:21:17.229 --> 01:21:17.909]  You can't deny it.
[01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:24.734]  And not only that, it's just it's with that.
[01:21:25.255 --> 01:21:28.617]  It really does mean we're heading toward the end of the earth.
[01:21:29.018 --> 01:21:31.620]  It doesn't mean that Jesus is going to come back tomorrow.
[01:21:32.683 --> 01:21:39.066]  And we're the next decade, but the fact is we are definitely now in the end time.
[01:21:39.106 --> 01:21:39.967]  We're in the birth pains.
[01:21:41.688 --> 01:21:54.874]  Yes, and that's very true, and there's... I don't really truly believe Jesus is going to come back until every last person who can be saved is in their salvation mode.
[01:21:54.934 --> 01:21:59.577]   I believe the That's exactly right.
[01:21:59.617 --> 01:22:03.698]  And I believe we're even hundreds of years away from that.
[01:22:03.538 --> 01:22:08.738]   isn't coming back until every man is hurting. Until there's no good men in the earth, basically.
[01:22:08.738 --> 01:22:15.018]   That's exactly right. And I believe we're even hundreds of years away from that.
[01:22:15.018 --> 01:22:20.938]   And if I may, now people might not believe this, but it's like there's a
[01:22:20.938 --> 01:22:33.147]   great website about that called worldwarnings.com It goes line by line, or step by step I should say, not line by line, but step by step, as to there is Bible prophecy.
[01:22:33.467 --> 01:22:37.009]  Daniel 12 predicted when Jesus was here the first time.
[01:22:37.290 --> 01:22:40.411]  I'm sorry, Daniel 9 predicted when Jesus was here the first time.
[01:22:40.872 --> 01:22:56.718]   Daniel 12 predicts in parallel to that prophecy when the time frame when he's coming back And I'm not going to spoil it all with those that time frame, but it's not too far away.
[01:22:56.838 --> 01:22:59.599]  You know, you're talking within a few lifetimes.
[01:23:00.239 --> 01:23:04.761]  Let's say somebody lives to 80 years old and another person is just getting warmed up right now.
[01:23:05.121 --> 01:23:06.741]  This is a precursor of what they want.
[01:23:07.962 --> 01:23:08.202]  Yes.
[01:23:08.322 --> 01:23:12.396]   And so They're talking, well I'll give you the time frame.
[01:23:12.696 --> 01:23:16.879]  Now there's three different years in that time frame that Daniel 12 points to.
[01:23:17.239 --> 01:23:18.280]  I'm not going to give those away.
[01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:24.544]  I know what they are from reading that prophecy and the dialogue on that WorldWarnings.com website.
[01:23:24.704 --> 01:23:26.125]  And I want to explain why this works this way.
[01:23:26.626 --> 01:23:39.575]  Evil has waves, good has waves, and so they'll attack, we'll push back, they'll attack, we'll push back, and there's finally a time where the evil wave overcomes the saints and it's full satanic control and then that's when it all kicks off.
[01:23:40.501 --> 01:23:43.166]  Yes, and we're pretty much right there now.
[01:23:43.707 --> 01:23:51.722]  And so, again, we're at the Revelation 13 phase, but still, there has to be enough time left for the play.
[01:23:52.708 --> 01:23:55.370]  There's the seals, the trumpets, and the plagues.
[01:23:55.731 --> 01:23:58.373]  And the seals are first, the trumpets and plagues are after that.
[01:23:58.673 --> 01:24:00.514]  And we're not even done with the seals yet, I don't think.
[01:24:00.775 --> 01:24:06.279]  And if you look at the Satanists, they're trying to, they admit with the Great Reset, they're trying to initiate Revelation before.
[01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:07.980]  That's what they're scared of.
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.682]  They're trying to do what's going to happen early to control it.
[01:24:12.144 --> 01:24:17.088]  Well, of course, you know, and I know, and God knows that they're devils.
[01:24:17.108 --> 01:24:20.070]  It's like, they can, you know, anybody can repent, for sure.
[01:24:20.618 --> 01:24:30.223]  But, obviously, evil's going to win until nobody is left on the earth, except for the few believers at the end.
[01:24:30.243 --> 01:24:34.125]  Well, if God hadn't intervened, there'd be no flesh spared.
[01:24:35.445 --> 01:24:36.266]  Well, that's correct.
[01:24:36.686 --> 01:24:38.707]  That doesn't just mean humans.
[01:24:38.747 --> 01:24:40.788]  We mean total death worldwide of all life.
[01:24:41.589 --> 01:24:42.709]  Well, absolutely.
[01:24:43.850 --> 01:24:49.090]   Sin's going to be the destruction of the world, for sure, and there'll only be a very few
[01:24:49.090 --> 01:24:51.729]  number of people left at the end.
[01:24:51.729 --> 01:24:56.730]   When Jesus comes back, he'll take the living - you know, they'll go into the air first,
[01:24:56.730 --> 01:25:00.850]   and then the dead will rise out of the graves in the resurrection and meet them in the air,
[01:25:00.850 --> 01:25:04.450]   and then - so, fine - and then all the wicked will be destroyed.
[01:25:04.450 --> 01:25:09.369]   And so most of the wicked - or most of the earth at the end - will be almost entirely
[01:25:09.369 --> 01:25:12.970]   wicked people who will be destroyed by Jesus Christ when he comes back.
[01:25:12.970 --> 01:25:18.249]   And it's hard to tell that to unbelievers, because they'll think, "No, no, God's all
[01:25:18.532 --> 01:25:20.014]  Yes, but He's also all truth.
[01:25:20.575 --> 01:25:22.276]  And it's not just love.
[01:25:22.477 --> 01:25:23.338]  There's also truth.
[01:25:23.638 --> 01:25:25.620]  And they both have to be in perfect harmony.
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:28.123]  Well, if you've chosen Satan, you're going to be destroyed.
[01:25:29.064 --> 01:25:30.185]  Well, that's true.
[01:25:30.625 --> 01:25:30.926]  And so...
[01:25:32.663 --> 01:25:34.885]  But anyway, I won't take more of your time.
[01:25:34.965 --> 01:25:35.685]  Well, God bless you.
[01:25:35.705 --> 01:25:36.526]  Great points, believer.
[01:25:36.966 --> 01:25:37.267]  All right.
[01:25:37.687 --> 01:25:39.909]  Nicole, when you come back, we're going to write to you.
[01:25:40.429 --> 01:25:41.710]  So many other callers straight ahead.
[01:25:42.190 --> 01:25:43.371]  This is all biblical, folks.
[01:25:43.451 --> 01:25:46.433]  And look, you see the Satanists, the pedophiles, they're Satanic.
[01:25:46.774 --> 01:25:49.516]  You see the different government heads now are admitted Satanists.
[01:25:49.836 --> 01:25:51.017]  They're coming out in the open.
[01:25:52.563 --> 01:25:57.805]  And whether we're going to see Armageddon in a year or a hundred years, I tend to agree with the caller, it's out of ways.
[01:25:58.786 --> 01:26:00.666]  There are many antichrists, as the Bible says.
[01:26:00.706 --> 01:26:04.328]  They try it over and over again until they have their perfected antichrist, they believe.
[01:26:04.628 --> 01:26:07.889]  So it's a beta test of what Satan's will is over and over again.
[01:26:08.189 --> 01:26:09.130]  Please keep us on air.
[01:26:10.530 --> 01:26:15.352]  Please spread the word about the special broadcast we're doing tonight with a bunch of big guests until midnight tonight.
[01:26:15.712 --> 01:26:16.633]  The Save Info Wars.
[01:26:17.561 --> 01:26:19.561]  extended emergency broadcast.
[01:26:19.561 --> 01:26:23.721]   X3 is back in stock, it's selling out, but we're still keeping it at 50% off,
[01:26:23.721 --> 01:26:26.461]   Vitamineral Fusion so much, and the biggest sale of the year,
[01:26:26.461 --> 01:26:30.521]   even bigger than the last sale just ended, double paid three points and 10% off
[01:26:30.521 --> 01:26:35.581]   on top of all the other discounts with promo code 1776, 1776.
[01:26:35.581 --> 01:26:42.881]   So the product's 30% off, promo code 1776 to check out, additional 10% off at infowarshaw.com.
[01:26:42.881 --> 01:26:44.801]  No excuse not to support the InfoWar.
[01:26:44.801 --> 01:26:45.801]  We'll be right back.
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:49.162]  (dramatic music)
[01:26:49.162 --> 01:27:01.721]  Look around you.
[01:27:02.210 --> 01:27:06.572]  Everything I predicted from the Globalist's own documents, from their own admissions, is now happening.
[01:27:07.212 --> 01:27:08.473]  Infowars credibility.
[01:27:08.973 --> 01:27:10.414]  My credibility has never been higher.
[01:27:11.114 --> 01:27:19.899]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I can steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits, stay on air.
[01:27:20.459 --> 01:27:25.442]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[01:27:26.102 --> 01:27:29.724]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[01:27:30.563 --> 01:27:33.228]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations.
[01:27:33.669 --> 01:27:39.620]  But I'm being forced by the Bankruptcy Court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:40.802]  It's unsustainable.
[01:27:41.243 --> 01:27:42.465]  So please, visit.
[01:27:43.544 --> 01:27:45.105]  SaveInfoWars.com.
[01:27:45.525 --> 01:27:53.389]  SaveInfoWars.com, where you can make straight donations, $5, $10, $50, $100, whatever you can, so that I can continue to persevere.
[01:27:53.649 --> 01:27:56.290]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[01:27:56.630 --> 01:27:57.611]  Thank you for your support.
[01:27:57.951 --> 01:27:58.791]  Wouldn't be here without you.
[01:27:59.051 --> 01:28:00.212]  SaveInfoWars.com.
[01:28:00.552 --> 01:28:08.616]  From the front lines of the information war, if you're receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:28:09.989 --> 01:28:11.210]  Alright, Nicole in Florida.
[01:28:11.230 --> 01:28:11.831]  Thanks for calling.
[01:28:11.851 --> 01:28:13.252]  Thanks for holding your own here worldwide.
[01:28:13.272 --> 01:28:15.173]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[01:28:15.233 --> 01:28:16.034]  Nice to talk to you.
[01:28:16.334 --> 01:28:18.856]  I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed your book.
[01:28:19.036 --> 01:28:22.059]  It is packed with information, but it's not a hard read.
[01:28:22.159 --> 01:28:23.280]  I tore through it.
[01:28:24.121 --> 01:28:31.927]  And I got the one off Amazon, and shortly afterwards, my dad said, you know, I never got you anything for your birthday, because you kept saying you didn't know what you wanted.
[01:28:32.407 --> 01:28:35.410]  And I said, I would love to have the autographed version of this book.
[01:28:35.490 --> 01:28:47.355]   I just can't justify Well let me thank your father, and again we're doing that as an emergency fundraiser.
[01:28:47.695 --> 01:28:50.298]  We would not be on air right now if it wasn't for folks who bought the signed copy.
[01:28:50.579 --> 01:28:52.220]  So I want to thank your father, Nicole.
[01:28:53.413 --> 01:28:55.074]  Yeah, and thank you for writing it.
[01:28:55.154 --> 01:28:55.894]  It's a great book.
[01:28:55.994 --> 01:29:02.358]  And when my brother's done with it, my plan is we have this little free take a book, leave a book library in the neighborhood.
[01:29:02.398 --> 01:29:04.559]  It's like on a like a mailbox post.
[01:29:04.639 --> 01:29:06.680]  It's a little box where people can put books in there.
[01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:09.121]  That's where it's going when he's done with it.
[01:29:09.557 --> 01:29:11.639]  And I just want to encourage other people to do that.
[01:29:11.699 --> 01:29:20.028]  Like, if you can afford to get an extra copy, put it in one of those little libraries, or leave it in a motel nightstand like the Gideon Bible.
[01:29:20.068 --> 01:29:25.194]  You know, put it out there so other people who might not have heard of it might say, hey, that looks interesting.
[01:29:25.234 --> 01:29:26.555]  Maybe I'll read that while I'm here.
[01:29:26.916 --> 01:29:28.498]  That's how we plant the seeds of victory.
[01:29:29.078 --> 01:29:29.719]  Perfectly said.
[01:29:29.759 --> 01:29:31.441]  Your view on the Great Reset and the War of the World.
[01:29:33.761 --> 01:29:39.064]  They're definitely making progress, but I think we still have a chance to stop them if we get enough people awake.
[01:29:39.565 --> 01:29:42.987]  And the other thing I wanted to mention was an idea for a t-shirt.
[01:29:43.507 --> 01:29:45.488]  Your Save the Frog shirts that you did.
[01:29:46.204 --> 01:29:49.305]  I didn't see them until they were almost sold out and I didn't get one.
[01:29:49.585 --> 01:29:54.127]  But I think it would be great if you did those again, especially with like a big color graphic on the back.
[01:29:54.347 --> 01:29:59.950]  It would be a good conversation starter, especially with people who might be on the left and more environmentally minded.
[01:30:00.010 --> 01:30:01.390]  Like, well, what is this about?
[01:30:01.450 --> 01:30:02.251]  Save the frogs.
[01:30:02.331 --> 01:30:03.511]  I care about the environment.
[01:30:03.571 --> 01:30:10.235]   And then you can start a conversation and Almost like a concert t-shirt, like, facts about Atrazine, facts about Frog Popular.
[01:30:10.455 --> 01:30:10.875]  I agree.
[01:30:11.195 --> 01:30:13.477]  We told folks we were selling all the t-shirts and we did it.
[01:30:13.497 --> 01:30:15.178]  Now we're going to have some limited editions.
[01:30:15.198 --> 01:30:16.438]  We've been so busy we haven't done it.
[01:30:16.879 --> 01:30:22.762]  But yeah, we're going to bring back some t-shirts, some new limited editions, and the Save the Frogs one is going to be first and foremost.
[01:30:23.122 --> 01:30:24.083]  Thanks for reminding me, Nicole.
[01:30:24.984 --> 01:30:25.284]  Great.
[01:30:25.324 --> 01:30:27.105]  I would love to get one when you come out with it.
[01:30:27.145 --> 01:30:28.325]  Thank you so much, Mr. Jones.
[01:30:28.345 --> 01:30:29.186]  You're doing a great job.
[01:30:29.426 --> 01:30:29.906]  I'm trying.
[01:30:29.926 --> 01:30:31.387]  Thank you so much, Nicole.
[01:30:31.908 --> 01:30:33.789]  Andrew, in the great state of Texas, you're on the air.
[01:30:33.829 --> 01:30:34.089]  Welcome.
[01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:44.884]  Hello Alex, I'm with the North Texas chapter of the John Birch Society, and I wanted to tell you first that I love your B12 product because I cannot absorb B12 in any other way.
[01:30:44.924 --> 01:30:47.706]  I have a genetic deficiency and your product is very, very good.
[01:30:47.946 --> 01:30:54.749]  Well that's right, a lot of Northern Europeans can't absorb it through the gut, only through the blood vessels, under the tongue, or by injection.
[01:30:54.769 --> 01:30:59.291]  I have the same genetic deficiency, so that's why B12 is so important for Northern Europeans.
[01:31:00.109 --> 01:31:00.710]  It's amazing.
[01:31:01.211 --> 01:31:19.364]   What I wanted to tell you is we had a meeting at our North Texas chapter yesterday with a lady named Jackie Schlegel from Texans for Medical Freedom and she has been instrumental in getting laws passed here in the state of Texas Uh, completely prohibiting the institution of vaccine passport systems.
[01:31:19.824 --> 01:31:21.085]  You need to have her on our show, man.
[01:31:21.125 --> 01:31:23.047]  And maybe tell your friend on Spotify about her, too.
[01:31:23.407 --> 01:31:24.808]  She's doing the good Lord's work with it.
[01:31:24.848 --> 01:31:29.611]  No, I totally agree, because Bill Gates and others are dumping hundreds of millions in to bring in the World ID card.
[01:31:29.951 --> 01:31:31.252]  That is a critical thing to defeat.
[01:31:31.292 --> 01:31:31.672]  You're right.
[01:31:32.433 --> 01:31:33.053]  What's her name?
[01:31:33.173 --> 01:31:35.015]  It's, uh, Jackie Shangle?
[01:31:35.715 --> 01:31:36.235]  Schlegel.
[01:31:36.875 --> 01:31:37.216]  Schlegel?
[01:31:38.116 --> 01:31:38.776]  Yes, Schlegel.
[01:31:38.916 --> 01:31:40.717]  And I can give her your contact information.
[01:31:41.177 --> 01:31:43.138]  I told her on the livestream.
[01:31:43.158 --> 01:31:45.398]  They livestreamed our meeting.
[01:31:45.898 --> 01:31:47.839]  I told her, you know, have you talked to Alex Jones?
[01:31:47.879 --> 01:31:48.759]  He's down in Austin.
[01:31:48.779 --> 01:31:50.140]  He's a local celebrity down there.
[01:31:50.540 --> 01:31:52.561]  You know, you're down there all the time for legislation.
[01:31:53.121 --> 01:31:54.821]  It's amazing you guys haven't linked up.
[01:31:54.901 --> 01:31:56.182]  She's doing really good work.
[01:31:57.461 --> 01:32:00.523]  Sounds good, brother, because we've got to get ahead of this World ID.
[01:32:00.583 --> 01:32:02.045]  That's the heart of their whole program.
[01:32:02.385 --> 01:32:04.426]  Yes, and she feels the same way.
[01:32:04.647 --> 01:32:05.307]  Social control.
[01:32:05.327 --> 01:32:09.090]  She wants to completely destroy that, starting at the local level.
[01:32:09.150 --> 01:32:14.414]  But getting her on your platform, I think, is key to getting this just going out into the stratosphere.
[01:32:15.114 --> 01:32:15.775]  I hear you, Andrew.
[01:32:15.795 --> 01:32:16.536]  Thank you so much.
[01:32:16.676 --> 01:32:17.036]  All right.
[01:32:17.576 --> 01:32:19.158]  Justin, Richard, Micah.
[01:32:20.037 --> 01:32:26.383]  Tom, Bill, Dr. John, James, Melissa, your calls are all coming up, bam, bam, bam, in 60 seconds.
[01:32:26.403 --> 01:32:29.226]  And then we have a special guest about to tell you about that is coming up.
[01:32:30.227 --> 01:32:32.129]  InfoWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[01:32:32.149 --> 01:32:33.791]  We're going live until midnight tonight.
[01:32:34.131 --> 01:32:40.718]  So please, everybody you know, special emergency broadcast at InfoWars.com forward slash show and band dot video.
[01:32:41.451 --> 01:32:47.434]  Well, they thought they'd launch their poison shots and cover it all up, but it's blowing up in their dirty, new-old-older faces.
[01:32:47.474 --> 01:33:00.980]  Evil always launches its attack when it thinks we're asleep, and we are asleep, and then it starts to lose and it freaks out and doubles down, and then humanity awakens and rises and defeats them.
[01:33:01.700 --> 01:33:02.601]  And that's where we are.
[01:33:03.061 --> 01:33:03.361]  All right.
[01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:16.176]  Coming up next segment after a few more of your phone calls, Jeff Nyquist of JR Nyquist blog is a really smart political analyst and talk show host and author.
[01:33:17.117 --> 01:33:23.301]  And he is the author of The Origin of the Fourth World War, The Fool and His Enemy, and The New Tactics of Global War.
[01:33:23.881 --> 01:33:27.743]  He's been a columnist for WorldNet Daily, Sierra Times, and Financial Sense Online.
[01:33:27.783 --> 01:33:29.784]  His writing is also published at Epoch Times.
[01:33:30.205 --> 01:33:31.585]  He joins us coming up.
[01:33:32.686 --> 01:33:39.228]  For 45 minutes ahead of the guest host, Jay Dyer in the fourth hour today.
[01:33:39.788 --> 01:33:43.069]  And then Owen Schroeder takes over 3 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:43.109 --> 01:33:45.670]  And I'm coming back tonight with a string of amazing guests.
[01:33:46.150 --> 01:33:48.411]  Steve Quayle, Robert Barnes, you name it.
[01:33:48.491 --> 01:33:51.332]  Tonight, starting at 6 p.m.
[01:33:51.372 --> 01:33:52.512]  Central, right till midnight.
[01:33:52.872 --> 01:33:53.953]  So be sure and share that.
[01:33:54.353 --> 01:33:55.953]  All right, Justin in Kansas.
[01:33:55.973 --> 01:33:57.354]  We're on the order of the calls received.
[01:33:57.694 --> 01:33:58.354]  Go ahead, Justin.
[01:33:59.914 --> 01:34:01.075]  Hey Alex, love you brother.
[01:34:01.395 --> 01:34:01.635]  Love you.
[01:34:02.972 --> 01:34:07.674]  Hey, first, real quick, I wanted to tell you that you're spot-on about Heaven.
[01:34:08.134 --> 01:34:12.536]  When I was 26, after years of drug abuse, I was saved.
[01:34:12.836 --> 01:34:15.137]  I asked God and the Holy Spirit to come into me.
[01:34:15.477 --> 01:34:22.560]  Soon after, I had a dream that Jesus came to me and revealed to me a little bit of what Heaven would feel like.
[01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:28.262]  I won't go into the details, but it was better than any needle, better than any pipe.
[01:34:28.775 --> 01:34:33.239]  I mean, a thousand times that and that was just a piece of what it would feel like.
[01:34:33.299 --> 01:34:34.020]  Piece is the word.
[01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:35.101]  I don't call it completion.
[01:34:35.521 --> 01:34:36.762]  It's just like, I'm done.
[01:34:36.782 --> 01:34:37.723]  This is everything I need.
[01:34:37.963 --> 01:34:38.323]  Forever.
[01:34:39.044 --> 01:34:39.885]  It's just like, wow.
[01:34:41.058 --> 01:34:42.459]  Yeah, and don't be fooled.
[01:34:42.479 --> 01:34:46.761]  This is a war for souls, because if it wasn't, they would just kill us right away.
[01:34:47.322 --> 01:34:52.965]  They want to demoralize us and then have us curse God and come to them.
[01:34:52.985 --> 01:34:54.446]  That's what this is.
[01:34:54.766 --> 01:35:00.910]  So we need to get out and we need to protest peacefully, but not in anything political.
[01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:02.431]  There's so many things that are going on.
[01:35:02.451 --> 01:35:07.514]  I think we need candlelight vigils with messages of peace and love for our enemies.
[01:35:08.257 --> 01:35:13.170]  Um, we also need to have, like, immune system for protest.
[01:35:13.230 --> 01:35:16.760]  We need people with signs that say, they are not with us.
[01:35:17.304 --> 01:35:25.266]  So if any infiltrators come in and try to have swastikas or any crazy stuff like that... No, it's always the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL.
[01:35:25.286 --> 01:35:26.207]  They even catch them.
[01:35:26.787 --> 01:35:28.748]  There aren't really real white supremacist folks.
[01:35:29.488 --> 01:35:32.489]  It's like finding a unicorn or something.
[01:35:32.529 --> 01:35:33.749]  It's all made up.
[01:35:33.789 --> 01:35:34.829]  It's leftist dressed up.
[01:35:35.770 --> 01:35:37.030]  It's just so disgusting.
[01:35:37.070 --> 01:35:37.830]  Thanks for the call, brother.
[01:35:38.331 --> 01:35:42.492]  Richard in Kentucky, I didn't read the call comments, disagrees.
[01:35:43.703 --> 01:35:45.064]  So I should have gone to you, the head of the line.
[01:35:45.084 --> 01:35:45.965]  I apologize, Richard.
[01:35:46.385 --> 01:35:48.567]  My rule is go to folks that screw you, the head of the line.
[01:35:48.587 --> 01:35:50.028]  Alex Jones, wrong about nuclear war.
[01:35:50.068 --> 01:35:51.629]  Okay, Richard, I hope you're right.
[01:35:51.829 --> 01:35:52.930]  Tell me about it from Kentucky.
[01:35:54.111 --> 01:35:55.472]  Okay, Alex.
[01:35:55.893 --> 01:35:59.195]  Revelation 18 talks about the fall of Baal.
[01:36:00.076 --> 01:36:07.962]  Two years ago, God revealed something to me, and I hope you all listen and read that verse, because he revealed he was going to destroy America soon.
[01:36:07.982 --> 01:36:12.846]  He said there was going to be a volcano at Yellowstone National Park going off the east coast of America.
[01:36:13.647 --> 01:36:21.051]  I couldn't figure out where the one off the East Coast was, so it went on and on, and finally he showed me, right in Washington, D.C., 18 miles from the White House.
[01:36:22.131 --> 01:36:23.592]  So it kept going on and on.
[01:36:23.632 --> 01:36:27.134]  I kept seeing this vision, and I asked him, reveal some more to me.
[01:36:27.374 --> 01:36:29.054]  And then he showed me a movie one day.
[01:36:29.074 --> 01:36:32.436]  I was sitting here with me and my wife.
[01:36:32.456 --> 01:36:32.436]  2012.
[01:36:33.737 --> 01:36:35.518]  It talks about a volcano at Yellowstone.
[01:36:36.018 --> 01:36:40.460]  Also talks about the earthquake at Washington, D.C., but it destroys the world.
[01:36:41.391 --> 01:36:42.592]  It's not going to destroy the world.
[01:36:42.652 --> 01:36:45.973]  It's going to destroy Canada, Mexico, and America.
[01:36:46.513 --> 01:36:52.236]  And if there's a nuclear war, according to Revelation 18, the rest of the world couldn't watch it on pay-per-view.
[01:36:53.137 --> 01:36:54.477]  That's what it says in that verse.
[01:36:55.498 --> 01:36:56.598]  But I go by verse 4.
[01:36:56.758 --> 01:36:59.260]  Sure, it says the whole world will watch the fall of Babylon.
[01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:00.580]  That's right.
[01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:03.722]  And how can somebody watch the fall of Babylon?
[01:37:06.223 --> 01:37:06.963]  On pay-per-view.
[01:37:07.224 --> 01:37:08.524]  Because that's what's happening right now.
[01:37:08.544 --> 01:37:10.145]  You can watch pay-per-view around the world.
[01:37:10.506 --> 01:37:15.970]  And you're going to destroy this country, just like you destroyed the rest of the countries who turned against him.
[01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:19.052]  And what we're doing, Alex, we're just killing people.
[01:37:19.132 --> 01:37:27.318]  The globalists know, pedophile drag queen story time, all of these abortion are curses, and if you do it, you will be cursed, you will be destroyed.
[01:37:27.338 --> 01:37:30.200]  And they're doing it on purpose, the Satanist are to destroy us.
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:31.581]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[01:37:31.621 --> 01:37:32.081]  I agree with you.
[01:37:33.069 --> 01:37:34.530]  Yeah, once he destroys America.
[01:37:35.031 --> 01:37:38.193]  Once he destroys America, that's when the Roman Empire rise up overseas.
[01:37:38.253 --> 01:37:39.915]  Well, I think we're seeing the destruction of America.
[01:37:39.935 --> 01:37:40.735]  I'm not disagreeing with you.
[01:37:40.755 --> 01:37:42.217]  I appreciate your call.
[01:37:42.257 --> 01:37:42.897]  We don't disagree.
[01:37:42.957 --> 01:37:43.938]  I don't know what's going to happen.
[01:37:44.298 --> 01:37:45.279]  I just know this is evil.
[01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:48.022]  And I'm not up here like some preacher, man.
[01:37:48.182 --> 01:37:49.343]  I mean, I'm not a perfect person.
[01:37:49.803 --> 01:37:50.664]  I don't cheat people.
[01:37:50.744 --> 01:37:51.625]  I don't lie to people.
[01:37:52.225 --> 01:37:53.126]  I don't steal from people.
[01:37:54.367 --> 01:37:58.150]  I've been a womanizer and I've gotten better about it over the years and a happy man and everything.
[01:37:58.170 --> 01:37:59.071]  I'm not going to lie to listeners.
[01:38:00.064 --> 01:38:02.887]  I like to drink, you know, and God made me the way I am.
[01:38:03.367 --> 01:38:07.070]  I've gotten a lot better about all of it, but I sure as hell am not going to sell anybody out.
[01:38:07.130 --> 01:38:09.452]  I don't serve Satan.
[01:38:10.052 --> 01:38:16.057]  I only tell you all that because I'm not one of these fake preachers up there on Sunday telling you how good they are and telling you how bad you are.
[01:38:16.458 --> 01:38:20.701]  I love God, I love children, I love freedom, and I will not be part of their satanic operation.
[01:38:21.082 --> 01:38:23.644]  But don't look to me like I'm Jesus because I'm not.
[01:38:24.324 --> 01:38:28.325]  I'm a fallen devil that loves God and has been redeemed by Jesus Christ.
[01:38:28.885 --> 01:38:33.546]  And the only reason I can do what I do is because of the power God gave me through His Son, Jesus Christ, to save me.
[01:38:34.147 --> 01:38:36.467]  Let's go ahead and talk to Micah in North Carolina.
[01:38:36.487 --> 01:38:37.007]  You're on the air.
[01:38:38.268 --> 01:38:38.808]  Hey Alex.
[01:38:39.268 --> 01:38:41.148]  Amen, actually, for what you just said.
[01:38:41.588 --> 01:38:45.349]  I actually just wanted to go on a little rant today about the nuclear war.
[01:38:45.429 --> 01:38:47.150]  I mean, it's definitely looming on the horizon.
[01:38:48.621 --> 01:38:49.602]  We have to stop this.
[01:38:49.742 --> 01:38:50.743]  We have no other choice.
[01:38:51.203 --> 01:38:56.888]  I mean, I've heard it a few times on the show, but I feel like maybe we could all start turning our flags upside down.
[01:38:57.469 --> 01:39:01.512]  Maybe it's a way to show that we don't stand with these old- That's a great idea, and it doesn't mean you're against America.
[01:39:01.532 --> 01:39:03.834]  When your neighbor asks, it means we're in an emergency.
[01:39:04.975 --> 01:39:06.797]  Yes, there's actually precedent for it.
[01:39:08.098 --> 01:39:11.241]  But yeah, I mean, we need to start turning our flags upside down everywhere.
[01:39:11.681 --> 01:39:14.584]  If you have a flag turned upside down, especially the largest ones.
[01:39:15.833 --> 01:39:17.854]  It'll draw publicity, and it'll be a signal to the world.
[01:39:17.874 --> 01:39:19.875]  I agree with restaurants and places we're in.
[01:39:20.175 --> 01:39:22.816]  The media would come and ask and say, hey, America's in S.O.S.
[01:39:23.157 --> 01:39:24.277]  This is a distress signal.
[01:39:24.957 --> 01:39:29.800]  Biden's running, he's destroyed the borders, he's abolished, he's cutting off our energy, he's starting nuclear war.
[01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:32.221]  Damn right, we need the flag flown upside down.
[01:39:32.481 --> 01:39:34.822]  That's a sign of respect that the country's in trouble.
[01:39:35.842 --> 01:39:36.362]  Yep.
[01:39:36.442 --> 01:39:39.684]  I mean, our country is diseased, I mean, with corruption and evil.
[01:39:40.325 --> 01:39:42.446]  You know, I mean, our fate is in our own hands.
[01:39:42.646 --> 01:39:43.667]  Yes, God will win.
[01:39:44.027 --> 01:39:45.648]  But without action, we won't see it.
[01:39:46.429 --> 01:39:47.509]  Exactly.
[01:39:47.529 --> 01:39:49.531]  You only show the flag to show the condition.
[01:39:49.831 --> 01:39:51.191]  We got black plague on your ship.
[01:39:51.252 --> 01:39:53.333]  It's a white flag with a red with a black spot.
[01:39:53.993 --> 01:39:55.374]  You're telling other ships don't come over here.
[01:39:55.394 --> 01:39:56.435]  We got bubonic plague.
[01:39:56.795 --> 01:39:59.116]  This is we love America, but it's upside down.
[01:39:59.797 --> 01:40:03.679]  Obama, this third administration, Biden has turned the country upside down.
[01:40:03.999 --> 01:40:04.820]  You're absolutely right.
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:08.542]  Our flag should be upside down to tell everybody we're in distress.
[01:40:10.051 --> 01:40:14.593]  Yeah, because like you said, they want to start revelation before it even happens.
[01:40:15.973 --> 01:40:20.495]  We can't allow it to happen because we won't even see the revelation when it happens because we won't be here.
[01:40:20.515 --> 01:40:25.577]  Their attempt is going to fail, but they know God's plan.
[01:40:25.597 --> 01:40:26.297]  I figured it out.
[01:40:26.377 --> 01:40:29.859]  Some of you, they're trying to trigger it early and trying to play it out.
[01:40:30.359 --> 01:40:30.859]  It's a joke.
[01:40:30.919 --> 01:40:31.559]  It's not going to work.
[01:40:31.599 --> 01:40:32.160]  Thank you, Micah.
[01:40:32.180 --> 01:40:33.680]  Let's take another call.
[01:40:37.176 --> 01:40:37.476]  Hello?
[01:40:37.796 --> 01:40:38.116]  Alex?
[01:40:38.456 --> 01:40:39.177]  Yes sir, go ahead.
[01:40:39.477 --> 01:40:40.557]  Can you hear me?
[01:40:40.577 --> 01:40:40.777]  I can.
[01:40:40.797 --> 01:40:44.819]  Hi Alex, I want to thank you very much for everything you do for the world.
[01:40:45.299 --> 01:40:46.819]  We really need somebody like you.
[01:40:47.900 --> 01:40:51.961]  Anyway, I had a premonition about four years ago.
[01:40:52.281 --> 01:40:53.881]  I'm from Windsor, Ontario.
[01:40:53.901 --> 01:40:57.323]  If you know where that is, it's right across the border from Detroit, Michigan.
[01:40:58.063 --> 01:41:01.344]  I saw a huge nuclear explosion over the river.
[01:41:01.364 --> 01:41:04.105]  I never thought much about it until January.
[01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:14.629]  January of this year, after Putin was mounting his troops, it's almost like it's just playing out in real time.
[01:41:15.450 --> 01:41:17.792]  I don't know if there's any way to prevent this.
[01:41:20.274 --> 01:41:22.917]  Well that's right, and Michigan produces a bunch of our weapons.
[01:41:23.337 --> 01:41:24.859]  You better believe it's a main target.
[01:41:26.060 --> 01:41:30.164]  And I'm half a mile from the river, so I'm vaporized right away.
[01:41:31.414 --> 01:41:38.437]  So I was thinking of taking my parents who are elderly and driving up to Northern Ontario, but then I don't know, is it better just to go right away?
[01:41:38.457 --> 01:41:40.338]  I was about to say that.
[01:41:40.378 --> 01:41:41.258]  I'm kind of with you.
[01:41:41.318 --> 01:41:51.163]  I'm not suicidal, but watching my kids die of radiation poisoning, I'm kind of like, God, I'm going to stay right here and if I just vaporize me, you know what I mean?
[01:41:51.203 --> 01:41:55.685]  Yeah, I think it's a tough call because... You should ask your parents what they want to do.
[01:41:55.705 --> 01:41:58.106]  I think your parents are going to want you vaporized.
[01:41:58.126 --> 01:41:58.546]  What do you think?
[01:41:59.608 --> 01:42:00.589]  They already told me.
[01:42:00.629 --> 01:42:03.391]  My guy says, just leave us there, take the car and go.
[01:42:03.451 --> 01:42:04.772]  And it's like, I can't do that.
[01:42:05.312 --> 01:42:06.033]  I just can't.
[01:42:06.993 --> 01:42:07.814]  No, don't leave your folks.
[01:42:07.834 --> 01:42:08.955]  Stay with them and get vaporized.
[01:42:09.796 --> 01:42:10.196]  Stay there.
[01:42:10.216 --> 01:42:12.998]  I got a guest for, if you can hold, when the guest is gone, I'll come back to you.
[01:42:13.018 --> 01:42:13.859]  If you can't, I understand that.
[01:42:14.539 --> 01:42:14.779]  Wow.
[01:42:15.199 --> 01:42:16.000]  Yeah, that's where I'm at.
[01:42:16.020 --> 01:42:17.341]  I'm going to stay here and get vaporized.
[01:42:18.922 --> 01:42:19.623]  I just, I can't.
[01:42:19.763 --> 01:42:20.864]  I'm just going to stay here, folks.
[01:42:21.444 --> 01:42:22.045]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:22.065 --> 01:42:22.325]  Stay with us.
[01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:26.862]  I've been reading his writings for many years, and he's with us now.
[01:42:26.942 --> 01:42:30.383]  Jeff Nyquist is author of Oranges of the Fourth World War.
[01:42:31.124 --> 01:42:34.085]  He writes for a lot of big publications like the Epoch Times and more.
[01:42:34.205 --> 01:42:40.188]  JR Nyquist blog, jrnyquist.com.
[01:42:40.649 --> 01:42:46.552]  And he joins us for the next 45 minutes to lay out the waterfront of geopolitically what is currently happening.
[01:42:46.612 --> 01:42:48.273]  Meanwhile, this is breaking.
[01:42:49.229 --> 01:42:53.551]  As we told you days ago, massive Russian troops in Belarus massing on the border.
[01:42:53.571 --> 01:42:54.811]  That's right up by Kiev.
[01:42:55.171 --> 01:43:01.433]  So not just an invasion from the east into the west, but now major invasion developments.
[01:43:01.894 --> 01:43:03.234]  We're going to get his take on that.
[01:43:03.294 --> 01:43:04.515]  Jeff Nyquist, thank you for joining us.
[01:43:05.735 --> 01:43:06.775]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[01:43:07.816 --> 01:43:08.996]  You're really a leading expert.
[01:43:09.016 --> 01:43:10.277]  I really respect your research.
[01:43:10.297 --> 01:43:11.097]  Where would you like to start?
[01:43:13.157 --> 01:43:24.805]  Well, there's some disturbing points here that I, you know, when I heard the news yesterday that the Russian troops were moving into Belarus, I realized that there were these other markers.
[01:43:24.865 --> 01:43:37.214]  For example, on the 23rd of September, the Polish Interior Ministry admitted that they were distributing potassium iodide tablets to their fire departments and emergency services.
[01:43:38.154 --> 01:43:40.076]  Finland has done similar things.
[01:43:40.856 --> 01:43:42.497]  Then you go to Biden's remarks.
[01:43:42.757 --> 01:43:49.439]  Now, always watch people who have access to intelligence and how they regard it.
[01:43:49.559 --> 01:43:53.300]  And Biden made a statement that was, I think, very significant.
[01:43:53.981 --> 01:44:06.905]  He said that because the Russian forces had suffered failures on the conventional war level, the danger that they would revert to using tactical nuclear weapons was serious.
[01:44:07.924 --> 01:44:14.327]  And then we go last week to the remarks that President Zelensky of Ukraine made to a group in Australia.
[01:44:14.567 --> 01:44:17.369]  You remember it created a little bit of stir last week.
[01:44:17.969 --> 01:44:26.673]  He talked about if Russia's going to do nuclear strikes that there needs to be preventive or preemptive strikes on those nukes.
[01:44:27.233 --> 01:44:29.495]  And then he said this is something that should be discussed.
[01:44:30.075 --> 01:44:32.256]  And everybody was kind of taken aback.
[01:44:33.236 --> 01:44:34.297]  What is he talking about?
[01:44:35.077 --> 01:44:37.379]  The BBC reached out to Zelensky on Friday.
[01:44:37.419 --> 01:44:47.627]  They did an interview that they published with him, trying to get him to walk it back, and of course, but what you really have to do when you watch this interview with Zelensky is look at his face, his demeanor.
[01:44:48.167 --> 01:44:56.873]  This is a guy who has received very, very frightening news, and it's about nuclear weapons, and he can't talk about it.
[01:44:57.094 --> 01:44:57.534]  No, I agree.
[01:44:57.774 --> 01:44:59.736]  He looks like he's dying in the interview.
[01:45:00.076 --> 01:45:02.598]  He doesn't look like the arrogant Zelensky of months ago.
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:05.542]  Yeah, this is very disturbing.
[01:45:05.562 --> 01:45:07.564]  I've never seen a national leader with this demeanor.
[01:45:07.604 --> 01:45:14.791]  And he's a man who, you know, as we watch him, he's a famous comedian because he has this great ability to express emotions through his face.
[01:45:15.592 --> 01:45:17.094]  And there is no poker face here.
[01:45:17.474 --> 01:45:20.918]  And now you have the other data point is Poland.
[01:45:21.644 --> 01:45:27.986]  Back when the war started, in the first few days, Poland had told its nationals to advise them to leave Belarus.
[01:45:28.487 --> 01:45:30.547]  Well, in September they advised them again.
[01:45:30.567 --> 01:45:55.746]   And again, you know, on the 10th, the day before the Russian troops moved into Belarus, this increase of the warning, increase of the alarm and the urgency, together with the potassium iodide, together with Zelensky's face looking like death warmed over and the President's remarks, We have to realize that there must be intelligence showing
[01:45:55.746 --> 01:45:59.947]  the Russians are about to use tactical nuclear weapons.
[01:45:59.947 --> 01:46:03.947]   The Russians, their artillery offensive was stopped by the Haramars.
[01:46:04.519 --> 01:46:14.841]  Their tank offensive was stopped in the winter, late winter, by the anti-tank rockets that, handheld rockets that were given to the Ukrainians.
[01:46:15.401 --> 01:46:30.864]  And now it's their air force and missiles and tactical nukes or maybe thermobaric warheads that can only make the breakthrough for their ground forces because their ground forces aren't better trained now and better led than they were in February, March, April.
[01:46:32.136 --> 01:46:38.580]  And that's why the former head of NATO is warned of Putin using nuclear weapons, because under Russian doctrine, when they're losing, that's the next step.
[01:46:39.801 --> 01:46:48.146]  Yeah, you know, the first thing that Putin did when he came to power in 2000, I think it was like the first or second week, he changed Russia's nuclear doctrine.
[01:46:48.947 --> 01:46:56.531]  And he changed it to say that when Russia itself is threatened, when its territory is threatened, first use of nukes is the doctrine.
[01:46:57.252 --> 01:47:05.689]   Now, you remember what happened, the Russians just annexed The four southeastern oblasts of Ukraine.
[01:47:06.209 --> 01:47:09.030]  And now they are considered by Moscow Russian territory.
[01:47:09.570 --> 01:47:15.291]  So because of this, he can then activate that doctrine legally under Russian law.
[01:47:16.471 --> 01:47:17.071]  Explain that.
[01:47:17.111 --> 01:47:19.352]  Any attack on that is an attack on the Russian homeland.
[01:47:20.972 --> 01:47:29.294]  Well, that would be correct, because now Zaporozhye, Kherson, Luhansk, and Donetsk are now considered by Moscow Russian soil.
[01:47:33.254 --> 01:47:34.375]  How do you see this unfolding?
[01:47:36.256 --> 01:48:05.701]   Well, the fact that the Russians are moving troops into Belarus, and we know they've been preparing, you know, this is, some analysts have been telling me that they've been expecting this move, and for two, three months now, because there's been evidence, intelligence that civilians can see, that Russia is preparing to renew its double envelopment attack, which remember, the initial attack, they attacked Towards the South, towards Odessa, at the same time they were attacking down on Kiev.
[01:48:05.721 --> 01:48:09.583]  That is, they were trying an encirclement of Ukraine.
[01:48:09.643 --> 01:48:13.904]  To cut it off from the West, to take its capital, to decapitate its leadership.
[01:48:14.585 --> 01:48:17.666]  That attack failed back in late winter.
[01:48:17.686 --> 01:48:21.328]  And really, a lot of experts didn't expect it to fail.
[01:48:21.368 --> 01:48:24.149]  The Ukrainian resistance was much stronger than people expected.
[01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:29.223]  Now it looks like they're going to renew the attack, but there has to be a difference.
[01:48:29.744 --> 01:48:50.491]   They can't possibly expect to succeed unless they're going to use either large numbers of tactical nuclear weapons or A thermobaric weapon, something, some new kind of ordinance, because... And massing in Belarus means they're not going to do encirclement now, they're going to try for the capital, or the attempt of Stalin taking over Berlin in 1945.
[01:48:50.591 --> 01:48:58.772]  I mean, they're massing troops there, and of course for folks who don't know, Kiev is like 60 miles or so from the Belarus border.
[01:48:59.012 --> 01:49:01.493]  This is going to be a main city invasion.
[01:49:01.533 --> 01:49:02.393]  Is that where you see this going?
[01:49:03.379 --> 01:49:04.079]  Well, no.
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:10.762]  In military terms, flanking is the whole idea.
[01:49:10.782 --> 01:49:20.185]  You get behind somebody, see, like, you know, in hand-to-hand combat, if someone's behind you, you're in danger because our eyes are on the front.
[01:49:20.826 --> 01:49:25.507]  And we can't see the danger, we might hear it, but we are not defensible from behind.
[01:49:25.527 --> 01:49:29.849]  Now, armies and countries have the same problem for a different reason.
[01:49:30.450 --> 01:49:33.793]  Because their supply lines, their logistics are behind them.
[01:49:34.433 --> 01:49:39.517]  You get an army behind your front, they're disrupting your communications.
[01:49:39.537 --> 01:49:41.499]  Well, exactly, so it's a pincer attack.
[01:49:41.559 --> 01:49:44.461]  The Russians are in the east, they're in the south, now they're coming from the north.
[01:49:45.522 --> 01:49:53.148]  Right, they're going to be, and there's a lot of evidence they've got something planned in the Black Sea and the Ukrainians, a lot of the Ukrainian moves in the south.
[01:49:53.908 --> 01:50:06.159]   Were I think to forestall this and they really the Ukrainians really concentrated on this in late summer, but the Ukrainians have pushed their attack In what may strategically be the wrong direction, in the East.
[01:50:06.319 --> 01:50:10.481]  And the Russians may be fine with that because the Russians are still thinking of a flanking attack.
[01:50:10.881 --> 01:50:19.066]  The most famous flanking battle, double envelopment they call it, was the Battle of Cannae in the Second Punic War, where Hannibal... Stay right there!
[01:50:19.086 --> 01:50:22.087]  And we also know that's where Napoleon lost the Battle of Waterloo.
[01:50:22.608 --> 01:50:26.229]  We're going to lay this out, folks, because what he's saying is dead on.
[01:50:26.269 --> 01:50:27.630]  Jeff Nyquist is our guest.
[01:50:27.970 --> 01:50:32.273]  The Russians have been massing troops in the North while they've got Ukraine distracted in the South.
[01:50:33.294 --> 01:50:37.455]  To me, it doesn't matter who started it, who's right or wrong.
[01:50:38.415 --> 01:50:43.076]  What matters is if you look at the doctrine of NATO, the United States and Russia, this is going to nuclear war.
[01:50:43.997 --> 01:50:45.717]  That's why Biden said Armageddon's here.
[01:50:45.777 --> 01:50:47.377]  It's why the Russians said this isn't a joke.
[01:50:48.458 --> 01:50:50.598]  And the more Putin loses, the more he's going to double down.
[01:50:51.779 --> 01:50:53.099]  Europe's having its energy cut off.
[01:50:54.099 --> 01:50:55.299]  The globals are cutting off our energy.
[01:50:55.319 --> 01:50:56.940]  We're being put into a global crisis.
[01:50:58.052 --> 01:51:00.074]  The likes of which this planet has never seen.
[01:51:00.655 --> 01:51:08.242]  Highly respected geopolitical analyst and author and journalist Jeff Nyquist is our guest, writes for Epoch Times and so many other great publications like WorldNetDaily.
[01:51:08.863 --> 01:51:25.396]   He's with us here and he's explaining that the Russians have mobilized, in fact the Ukrainians thought the main attack would come from the north at first, but it hasn't, but now it looks like the main Russian force, not just the reserves and Yeah, I just, I'm going to do this illustration for us.
[01:51:25.416 --> 01:51:26.877]  Imagine a front line that runs straight like this.
[01:51:26.917 --> 01:51:28.937]  On one side is the Ukrainians, one side is the Russians.
[01:51:28.757 --> 01:51:32.757]   give you the floor to break down how historical this is and how dangerous this is.
[01:51:32.757 --> 01:51:36.516]  Yeah, I just, I'm going to do this illustration for us.
[01:51:36.516 --> 01:51:39.717]  Imagine a front line that runs straight like this.
[01:51:39.717 --> 01:51:42.676]  On one side is the Ukrainians, one side is the Russians.
[01:51:42.676 --> 01:51:48.837]   You start to, Ukrainians advance to the east in the middle and notice what happens to the
[01:51:48.837 --> 01:51:51.237]  flanks of the Ukrainians.
[01:51:51.237 --> 01:51:53.796]  Then if the Russians attack, they can make a circle.
[01:51:54.803 --> 01:52:00.064]  Now in the Battle of Cannae, as I was saying before the break, this was one of the most famous battles in history.
[01:52:00.784 --> 01:52:09.406]  And military strategists have been trying, and generals and heads of general staffs have been trying to imitate Hannibal in this Battle of Cannae.
[01:52:09.446 --> 01:52:13.407]  What happened is you had two Roman consular armies, 60,000 men.
[01:52:14.207 --> 01:52:20.128]  They attacked 50,000 troops under Hannibal at Cannae.
[01:52:21.519 --> 01:52:26.283]  They just plowed right into them and they let them come right in the center.
[01:52:26.303 --> 01:52:33.169]  They just fell back in the center and then they just started doing circle until they had the Romans completely surrounded and then they pressed them.
[01:52:33.829 --> 01:52:37.232]  And the Romans were pressed so tight they couldn't even raise their sword arms.
[01:52:37.252 --> 01:52:38.393]  They were pressed against each other.
[01:52:39.994 --> 01:52:42.857]  60,000 Romans were cut down in one afternoon, one day.
[01:52:43.795 --> 01:52:51.367]  You imagine that kind of loss when the population of the world was so much less, and Rome was a city, not a giant continent-sized country.
[01:52:51.407 --> 01:52:58.057]  It was a massive disaster, comparable in the slaughter to what the British suffered at the first day of the Battle of the Somme.
[01:52:59.031 --> 01:53:03.075]  And this is the kind of strategy the Russians are applying to Ukraine.
[01:53:03.115 --> 01:53:06.878]  They tried it in the end of winter, and now they're recasting it.
[01:53:07.338 --> 01:53:15.265]  And it's impossible to imagine how they would expect to do it without the use of some special weaponry, nuclear weaponry especially.
[01:53:15.305 --> 01:53:21.018]   And we're getting these hints, as I said, from President Biden and explain they heard them all together
[01:53:21.018 --> 01:53:24.978]   like a fish in a barrel then they've got to use Because they don't have the same targeting the West does
[01:53:24.978 --> 01:53:26.257]  they do have nuclear weapons?
[01:53:26.257 --> 01:53:29.878]   They've got to use really devastating weapons to make those forces capitulate
[01:53:29.878 --> 01:53:36.838]   Well, it's the devastating weapons to make the breakthrough because Ukraine as this they tried to encircle Ukraine
[01:53:36.838 --> 01:53:41.078]   They're gonna try to cut south from Belarussia to cut the supply lines from the west
[01:53:41.078 --> 01:53:46.257]   To cut off the tracks and the roads and to cut off Kiev from the rest of the world
[01:53:47.338 --> 01:53:49.338]  Storming a city is not a good idea.
[01:53:49.159 --> 01:54:04.902]  I mean, it's a horrible thought, but you could use a thermobaric bombardment on Kiev, nuclear bombardment of Kiev and Lviv, which are the main transit hubs and the main cities in the western and west-central Ukraine that would be, that are basically supporting the war.
[01:54:05.778 --> 01:54:26.384]  Um, and then if you can come up from the south, the Russians do have amphibious forces and they have a fleet in the Black Sea and they could try to then re-establish a position, amphibious landing around Odessa and try to then reactivate that southern push so they have the southern pits are coming from the south, the northern one from Belorussia, if they can connect behind Kiev.
[01:54:27.714 --> 01:54:35.097]  In Western Ukraine, if they can connect, that will doom the Ukrainian forces because it's almost like cutting off a person's airway.
[01:54:35.597 --> 01:54:51.563]  Unless Ukraine receives constant supplies from the western part of the country and from NATO, unless they have those supplies coming to their frontline units, their frontline units will begin to run out of fuel, run out of ammunition, and their morale will take a hit.
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:55:02.383]  Well, how does it feed in here, though, that, I mean, from most analysis I've seen, I tend to agree with, I've talked to folks who are over there, the Russians, things aren't going as well as the Russians thought, fighting Western high-tech weapons.
[01:55:03.584 --> 01:55:08.005]  Are you saying this is always part of the plan, or when do you think Russia's going to invade from the north?
[01:55:10.447 --> 01:55:13.148]  You know, most of the Ukrainian weapons are Soviet-era weapons.
[01:55:13.469 --> 01:55:19.471]  The Ukrainian army is largely, its brigades are armed, like the Russian units are armed.
[01:55:19.872 --> 01:55:21.112]  The difference is the training.
[01:55:21.412 --> 01:55:34.039]  The Ukrainians, after the war started in Donetsk back in 2014, the Ukrainians said, look, the first couple of battles, the Ukrainians really suffered heavy casualties.
[01:55:34.059 --> 01:55:39.659]   They actually suffered the first battle, a larger battle in Donbass.
[01:55:39.659 --> 01:55:44.658]   The Ukrainians suffered a double envelopment in which their forces were annihilated.
[01:55:44.658 --> 01:55:49.978]   And the Russians tried to repeat that in another battle and the Ukrainian forces slipped away.
[01:55:49.978 --> 01:55:54.059]   The Ukrainians are used to seeing the Russians make this maneuver.
[01:55:54.059 --> 01:55:58.097]   And so the Ukrainians have positioned reserves and they are watching for this.
[01:55:58.150 --> 01:56:05.337]  And what happened in February when this happened, the Ukrainians were quickly able to bring up brigades and protect Kiev's flank.
[01:56:05.797 --> 01:56:13.825]  And the Russians brought paratroopers, if you recall, right behind Kiev to make the encirclement and to go after Kiev and to decapitate the government.
[01:56:14.375 --> 01:56:15.196]  That failed.
[01:56:15.256 --> 01:56:18.638]  That assault attempted to encircle Kiev failed.
[01:56:19.198 --> 01:56:24.922]  Now a much broader encirclement is probably what they will do, not going after a city if they need to take a city out.
[01:56:25.202 --> 01:56:28.164]  Again, the terrible thought that a nuclear weapon would be used.
[01:56:28.804 --> 01:56:40.312]  And of course, the Russians now, you will notice that they are justifying these things by the attack on their infrastructure, the Nord Stream Pipeline, and the attack on the Dekkerk Strait Bridge.
[01:56:40.942 --> 01:56:43.124]  And they can say, look, we're under attack.
[01:56:43.945 --> 01:56:44.905]  We need to do this.
[01:56:44.986 --> 01:56:46.167]  We need to respond.
[01:56:46.767 --> 01:56:50.710]  And they have threatened, you know, attack on the Kirk Strait Bridge was a red line for the Russians.
[01:56:50.830 --> 01:56:51.011]  Sure.
[01:56:51.051 --> 01:56:52.952]  So what is what is a nuclear weapon do?
[01:56:53.032 --> 01:56:55.895]  Because it turns the whole world against Russia at that point.
[01:56:57.696 --> 01:57:00.759]  Well, the world may be turned against Russia now.
[01:57:01.566 --> 01:57:03.487]  Already, so what have they got to lose?
[01:57:04.888 --> 01:57:10.031]  It seems that Mr. Putin and the Kremlin do not have a reverse gear here.
[01:57:10.291 --> 01:57:11.892]  It's only to go into higher gear.
[01:57:12.273 --> 01:57:14.614]  I mean, people have made this observation.
[01:57:14.754 --> 01:57:22.479]  I mean, you would think that Mr. Putin would want to concede something, but instead he just ups the ante by annexing the four territories.
[01:57:22.979 --> 01:57:32.304]  In fact, the Ukrainian reaction to the annexation was to pass a law making it illegal for any Ukrainian politician to negotiate away that territory.
[01:57:33.104 --> 01:57:35.045]  Ukrainians are fighting to get it all back.
[01:57:35.826 --> 01:57:39.507]  The Russians are fighting to keep it all and to go further, I think.
[01:57:40.508 --> 01:57:48.552]  This is something that Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said, is that, well, you know, if they resist us, we'll take the whole country, you know, basically.
[01:57:49.056 --> 01:57:56.923]  And this was, by the way, when Putin made his initial speech before the invasion began in February, he said Ukraine is not a real country.
[01:57:58.104 --> 01:58:00.827]  And basically saying it is part of Russia.
[01:58:01.087 --> 01:58:02.929]  So what's the timetable, Jeff Nyquist?
[01:58:04.230 --> 01:58:13.839]  Well, it's if Russian troops are just crossing into Belarus now, it's going to take them a while to fully deploy into the country and to get ready.
[01:58:14.685 --> 01:58:18.427]  And of course, if they want to wait till the ground freezes, they may have to wait till November.
[01:58:18.947 --> 01:58:24.269]  But of course, if a nuclear bombardment is in the cards, that could take place at any time.
[01:58:26.010 --> 01:58:36.374]  My guess is, knowing Soviet military doctrine, which is inherited from the Russian Federation, the nuclear strikes and the actual invasion of the forces have to come close together.
[01:58:37.315 --> 01:58:39.976]  So my guess is, you know, three, four, five weeks.
[01:58:40.802 --> 01:58:41.342]  I agree.
[01:58:41.823 --> 01:58:43.464]  And Henry Kissinger's not a good guy.
[01:58:43.504 --> 01:58:47.067]  But even Henry Kissinger and the Pope are saying we should have a peace deal.
[01:58:46.907 --> 01:58:49.907]  within a week or two, but anything is possible.
[01:58:49.907 --> 01:58:50.907]  It's hard to predict.
[01:58:50.907 --> 01:58:51.907]  I agree.
[01:58:51.907 --> 01:58:55.826]   And Henry Kissinger is not a good guy, but even Henry Kissinger and the Pope are saying
[01:58:55.826 --> 01:58:56.907]  we should have a peace deal.
[01:58:56.907 --> 01:59:01.346]   That shows you even old-line globalists are really concerned.
[01:59:01.346 --> 01:59:05.105]   Well Kissinger made it, you know Kissinger is a political scientist, he has a lot of
[01:59:05.105 --> 01:59:05.786]  education.
[01:59:06.125 --> 01:59:10.827]  Kissinger made a statement which I agree with, which is very important to keep in mind.
[01:59:11.607 --> 01:59:12.988]  He made this statement back in March.
[01:59:13.028 --> 01:59:19.711]  He said, look, the whole Western military systems and political systems based on the idea of deterrence.
[01:59:20.638 --> 01:59:24.640]  We talk all kinds of ways to deter.
[01:59:25.140 --> 01:59:28.682]  Well, mad is an older form of deterrence from the 1960s.
[01:59:28.762 --> 01:59:35.524]  But to deter an attack, you make your counterattack terrible enough so that the enemy can't get any advantage from it.
[01:59:36.185 --> 01:59:40.467]  So but what Kissinger said is he said, we have had no discussion.
[01:59:41.107 --> 01:59:43.928]  Our strategists, our leaders have never had the discussion.
[01:59:44.388 --> 01:59:45.789]  What if deterrence fails?
[01:59:47.313 --> 01:59:53.277]  And the danger here is that we haven't thought it through, we haven't discussed it, and we will not know what to do.
[01:59:53.317 --> 01:59:56.399]  And we have a president that literally doesn't know what planet he's on.
[01:59:57.300 --> 02:00:00.702]  Jeff Nyquist, our guest, straight ahead, on the verge of nuclear war.
[02:00:00.762 --> 02:00:01.182]  Stay with us.
[02:00:03.224 --> 02:00:06.366]  Well, I'm really impressed over the years reading Jeff Nyquist's work.
[02:00:06.406 --> 02:00:08.367]  I hope he'll come back again soon, join us for a full hour.
[02:00:09.008 --> 02:00:10.269]  Hell, maybe a commercial free tonight.
[02:00:10.289 --> 02:00:11.069]  We're going to midnight.
[02:00:11.770 --> 02:00:13.591]  But his analysis is dead on.
[02:00:14.901 --> 02:00:17.283]  And we are in grave danger right now.
[02:00:17.784 --> 02:00:22.389]  You know, I noticed starting last week, our great iodine product, X3, was selling out.
[02:00:22.929 --> 02:00:23.870]  I didn't raise the price of it.
[02:00:23.910 --> 02:00:24.851]  I kept it at 50% off.
[02:00:25.432 --> 02:00:31.297]  In fact, during this crisis, the promo code 1776, 1776 at checkout, it's 60% off.
[02:00:31.658 --> 02:00:33.480]  We'll sell out probably in a week at current sales rates.
[02:00:33.880 --> 02:00:35.241]  It's not going to protect you from nuclear war.
[02:00:35.582 --> 02:00:38.685]  Waking up and praying to God and repenting and a peace deal will do that.
[02:00:39.835 --> 02:00:43.616]  A few isotopes that protects your thyroid during an nuclear war, but not for the main war.
[02:00:43.876 --> 02:00:46.877]  You're going to die from the starvation, the power outages, all the rest of it.
[02:00:46.897 --> 02:00:47.877]  We don't sell it because of that.
[02:00:48.197 --> 02:00:52.078]  We sell it because of what it does for energy, and your immune system, your stamina, and your libido.
[02:00:52.358 --> 02:00:55.058]  This is the best, all three good types of iodine in one.
[02:00:55.078 --> 02:00:57.539]  50% off at InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:00:57.879 --> 02:00:58.959]  Promo code 1776.

[02:01:06.801 --> 02:01:07.502]  So much more.
[02:01:08.082 --> 02:01:12.245]  We've got several other specials I haven't hit because I've been so, so incredibly busy.
[02:01:12.265 --> 02:01:14.307]  We get a discount on the signed book or unsigned book.
[02:01:14.707 --> 02:01:15.628]  Also a promo code 1776.
[02:01:16.208 --> 02:01:19.251]  And we're gonna go until midnight tonight.
[02:01:19.311 --> 02:01:21.652]  Got a bunch of big special guests joining us.
[02:01:21.712 --> 02:01:26.796]  But going back to Jeff Nyquist, here's this 7.5 billion person question.
[02:01:27.156 --> 02:01:31.219]  They always say the billion dollar question or the 67 trillion dollar question with inflation.
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:40.204]  But no, this is the 7.5 million person question, is how do we avert this when it's clearly escalating towards Armageddon?
[02:01:43.585 --> 02:01:47.627]  Well, it's up to Moscow what they do next.
[02:01:48.608 --> 02:01:51.069]  They can escalate and continue the war or not.
[02:01:52.370 --> 02:01:57.192]  I don't think the Ukrainians, it's emotional with them, they're not going to change their position.
[02:01:57.907 --> 02:02:00.989]  The West can't tell Ukraine what to do in this circumstance.
[02:02:01.009 --> 02:02:02.510]  They could withdraw support.
[02:02:03.190 --> 02:02:18.300]  I don't think there's a political wherewithal in the West to do it because, again, the sympathy in Europe for Ukraine and the fear of Russia is partly driving this from the European end.
[02:02:18.920 --> 02:02:26.765]  And, of course, the other aspect, the elephant in the room that we haven't discussed is China and North Korea, both nuclear powers.
[02:02:29.012 --> 02:02:33.714]  You know, they just did an exercise, North Korea practicing loading nuclear weapons onto their missiles.
[02:02:36.015 --> 02:02:52.722]  You know, China's been in this mobilization, and we had the 57-minute meeting smuggled out, military-civil meeting in Guangdong smuggled out by people, many of whom have been murdered since, about transforming China from normal to war.
[02:02:52.922 --> 02:02:54.863]  So China's undergoing a mobilization.
[02:02:55.689 --> 02:02:57.690]  Transforming ships, getting ships ready.
[02:02:57.730 --> 02:02:59.670]  There's tanks in the Chinese ports.
[02:03:00.490 --> 02:03:04.652]  It looks like China is ready to join a widened war.
[02:03:05.672 --> 02:03:12.714]  And this is really frightening because I don't think Russia would be pushing this if they didn't have China behind them.
[02:03:14.114 --> 02:03:23.597]  In fact, Putin and Xi Jinping met on February 4th in Beijing, just before the Beijing Olympics, on the day the Beijing Olympics started.
[02:03:24.582 --> 02:03:25.583]  Before this invasion.
[02:03:25.623 --> 02:03:28.824]  So I think President Xi of China gave the go-ahead.
[02:03:29.304 --> 02:03:31.445]  Gave Russia permission to do this.
[02:03:31.605 --> 02:03:34.106]  And then they met again in Samarkand a couple weeks back.
[02:03:34.667 --> 02:03:36.647]  And again, we see these... That's right.
[02:03:36.728 --> 02:03:38.989]  First time Xi Jinping's left in two years.
[02:03:39.029 --> 02:03:39.849]  He goes to meet with Putin.
[02:03:40.925 --> 02:03:57.339]  Yeah, and of course, right after this meeting, Putin announces this mobilization, this large mobilization, which, by the way, is larger than the stated 300,000 reports out of Russia, and many experts are saying, look, this could be 1.3, 1.2 million men they've tried to mobilize.
[02:03:57.719 --> 02:04:07.628]  And however many Russians have fled the border or whatever, you know, I think the Russian defense minister is correct when he says, well, we have 25 million men of military age in Russia.
[02:04:07.828 --> 02:04:13.523]   So they have a vast, Uh, a number of men they could call upon.
[02:04:13.563 --> 02:04:17.768]  The problem that Russia has, though, is that people don't really want to fight.
[02:04:18.589 --> 02:04:27.159]  And so they're trying to motivate them, and the propaganda's turned up, and you know, they, okay, they call up 1.2 million men, they only get 600,000.
[02:04:27.739 --> 02:04:28.600]  Still, that's a lot of men.
[02:04:31.866 --> 02:04:42.574]  And it allows them to equip new armies, and we just don't have any idea how much equipment the Russians have built, what they're sitting on, whether they've even committed their best weapons yet.
[02:04:43.695 --> 02:04:50.460]  So, there's a lot of unknowns, and of course, their best weapons really are their hypersonic missiles, their nuclear warheads.
[02:04:50.820 --> 02:04:54.043]  That's where they've really put all their eggs in that basket.
[02:04:54.483 --> 02:04:58.566]  Nuclear war is the kind of war where suddenly the playing field becomes level.
[02:04:59.418 --> 02:05:06.865]  And the West, you know, imagine if they used nuclear weapons here in Ukraine to finish the war, what would happen to the markets in the West?
[02:05:07.505 --> 02:05:08.326]  Would they cave in?
[02:05:08.446 --> 02:05:09.867]  Would we have massive panic here?
[02:05:09.947 --> 02:05:13.290]  I think if one nuke goes off, we have a global depression.
[02:05:13.630 --> 02:05:15.912]  I mean, let's talk about that, Jeff Nyquist.
[02:05:16.393 --> 02:05:18.214]  What does a limited nuclear war look like?
[02:05:18.254 --> 02:05:21.037]  And most analysis shows it would quickly get out of hand.
[02:05:22.975 --> 02:05:24.837]  Yeah, a lot of people, well that's like war.
[02:05:24.877 --> 02:05:34.045]  You know, once you do a war, you're stepping across a barrier psychologically and also in terms of action in which one thing leads to another and you're not in control.
[02:05:34.105 --> 02:05:36.027]  You know, the idea that people control events.
[02:05:36.748 --> 02:05:46.983]   It's easy to control events when you wake up every morning and you have your coffee and you go to the same job, but when suddenly everything is changing and very violent, You lose control very easily.
[02:05:47.003 --> 02:05:47.323]  I agree.
[02:05:47.343 --> 02:05:48.987]  Let's talk about the politics inside Russia.
[02:05:50.209 --> 02:05:52.734]  You think it's accurate there's a lot of heat on Putin to be more hardline?
[02:05:54.281 --> 02:05:56.502]  There's heat from the hardliners.
[02:05:56.823 --> 02:05:57.703]  Definitely there is.
[02:05:58.183 --> 02:06:11.191]  There is also trepidation by many people in Russia because they're afraid that this is going to become nuclear and they're afraid that their sons are going to go forward and become part of the casualties.
[02:06:11.691 --> 02:06:13.693]  I think it's true.
[02:06:13.893 --> 02:06:21.418]   Russia probably has suffered 60,000 battlefield deaths and 50 to 60,000 missing and wounded and prisoners.
[02:06:21.978 --> 02:06:23.459]  So this is tremendous casualty.
[02:06:23.519 --> 02:06:29.063]  If the initial invasion force was, you know, between 180 and 200,000, that's almost a third.
[02:06:29.083 --> 02:06:34.647]  I mean, Ukraine can stupidly make fun of the dead bodies and have pigs eating Russian dead soldiers.
[02:06:34.988 --> 02:06:36.729]  That's not getting them points in Russia.
[02:06:38.410 --> 02:06:40.572]  Well, Russia likes to put this propaganda on.
[02:06:40.612 --> 02:06:46.531]   Look, both sides, Ukraine and Russia, are going to, you know, Depict the other side.
[02:06:46.571 --> 02:06:49.033]  I mean, this is, you could call this a Soviet Civil War.
[02:06:49.493 --> 02:06:51.555]  Because both these countries were Soviet Republics.
[02:06:51.575 --> 02:06:53.196]  Congress, it's like a Slavic Civil War!
[02:06:54.297 --> 02:06:59.741]  Yeah, well, you know, Putin is really trying to put the Soviet Union back together again.
[02:06:59.781 --> 02:07:00.642]  Let's be realistic.
[02:07:00.722 --> 02:07:08.568]  I mean, when Sergei Shoigu, several weeks ago, was caught on video saying, first we put the Soviet Union back and then we have peace.
[02:07:09.452 --> 02:07:23.808]  And then you had this social media message by Dmitry Medvedev, the former president, talking about restoring the borders of the Soviet Union and how Kazakhstan is massacring Russians and we need to move into Kazakhstan.
[02:07:25.182 --> 02:07:32.166]  Look, Russia's neighbors are getting more and more alarmed at this attempt to re-establish the empire, so to speak.
[02:07:32.866 --> 02:07:53.136]  And look, everybody in the surrounding countries, you look at how Finland is mobilizing, how Sweden and Finland have joined NATO, how Poland has reacted to be increasing to try to make one of the biggest armies in Europe, how they're reacting in Romania, the countries that have experienced a Russian heel on their neck.
[02:07:54.166 --> 02:08:03.152]  Are the most alarmed they do not want to be under the Russian boot and they are mobilizing more than anyone and I think it's a it's a reflection.
[02:08:03.192 --> 02:08:15.059]  I mean Germany in this Germany and France I've been lukewarm in this whole thing that the big countries in Europe But you look at those countries that have their real neck in at stake.
[02:08:15.579 --> 02:08:22.974]   They're really worried and they're really taking steps and Can we do anything in the West?
[02:08:22.994 --> 02:08:35.259]  Because when I look at the emblematic weakness of Obama's third administration, Joe Biden, and I just see the average American going about their business like nothing's happening.
[02:08:35.940 --> 02:08:42.863]  It just, it really adds a layer to this, kind of the icing on the cake that spells doom to me.
[02:08:44.366 --> 02:08:46.307]  Well, we have our normalcy bias.
[02:08:46.347 --> 02:08:55.573]  Look, I've said for years, we live in a shopping mall regime, and it's all based on economic optimism, because people, the system depends on a continuous investment in the future.
[02:08:55.593 --> 02:09:10.943]  And if people don't believe those investments are going to pay off, that there is no future in the economic sense, that we're going to be having a war, and a war of tremendous destruction, the system is going to economically fail, or it's going to change.
[02:09:11.661 --> 02:09:14.984]  And that may be what we're going to confront if this becomes a larger war.
[02:09:15.024 --> 02:09:20.568]  Remember, when World War I started, many of the markets around the world closed until that war was over.
[02:09:21.108 --> 02:09:22.249]  And the same for World War II.
[02:09:22.289 --> 02:09:29.594]  World War III is going to even be harder on the markets and on investments and anything that people have money in.
[02:09:30.235 --> 02:09:32.837]  And that's exactly what Klaus Schwab wants is the Great Reset.
[02:09:35.396 --> 02:09:45.002]  Well, it's very interesting because war is one of those things that allows people who want to create socialism and a new global totalitarian system.
[02:09:45.022 --> 02:09:46.443]  Yeah, war is the health of the state.
[02:09:48.104 --> 02:09:48.324]  Right.
[02:09:48.384 --> 02:09:52.266]  Well, the state is, the function of the state is to protect society.
[02:09:52.767 --> 02:10:04.594]  And in that protective function, in an extreme emergency, suddenly the people in charge can use those emergency powers in a way not intended, that is just for security, but to build something new.
[02:10:05.262 --> 02:10:07.924]  And this is always a danger, you know, like George Washington said.
[02:10:07.944 --> 02:10:08.204]  That's right.
[02:10:08.244 --> 02:10:08.884]  War is good for tyranny.
[02:10:08.924 --> 02:10:13.107]  Jeff Nyquist, jrnyquist.blog, jrnyquist.com.
[02:10:13.427 --> 02:10:14.487]  Join us again soon, sir.
[02:10:14.548 --> 02:10:15.848]  Thank you so much and God bless.
[02:10:16.849 --> 02:10:17.249]  Thank you.
[02:10:17.769 --> 02:10:19.130]  Hour number four, straight ahead.
[02:10:18.949 --> 02:10:21.149]  I've got your calls and then Jay Dyer.
[02:10:21.149 --> 02:10:30.149]  Why don't we talk about cryptocurrency?
[02:10:30.149 --> 02:10:32.149]  Okay.
[02:10:32.571 --> 02:10:40.758]  Because one of the ways that you encourage your audience to give you money is in cryptocurrency donations, right?
[02:10:40.898 --> 02:10:41.158]  Yes.
[02:10:41.779 --> 02:10:45.222]  And you have a page on your website that's just for cryptocurrency donations, right?
[02:10:45.582 --> 02:10:47.564]  InfoWars.com forward slash crypto.
[02:10:47.584 --> 02:10:50.146]  Is that a little advertisement just there?
[02:10:50.286 --> 02:10:51.327]  Well, we're fighting the deep state.
[02:10:51.367 --> 02:10:51.868]  We need money.
[02:10:52.068 --> 02:10:52.288]  All right.
[02:10:53.229 --> 02:10:53.849]  This is it.
[02:10:54.530 --> 02:10:55.431]  Give crypto.
[02:10:55.531 --> 02:10:56.652]  Fund InfoWars.
[02:10:57.461 --> 02:11:00.642]  Sponsor us with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, right?
[02:11:01.162 --> 02:11:03.722]  That will end up as a clip on your show tonight.
[02:11:03.742 --> 02:11:05.763]  Your advertisement for a cryptocurrency page.
[02:11:07.083 --> 02:11:14.844]  You know, I mean, I mean, people want to keep us in the fight, so I mean, I hope whoever the big whales are, they'll give us money before we keep going.
[02:11:15.264 --> 02:11:16.345]  We'll just keep, we'll just keep.
[02:11:17.385 --> 02:11:19.605]  We need some money as you're in this boardroom, won't we?
[02:11:19.745 --> 02:11:22.686]  Alright, let's move on.
[02:11:22.586 --> 02:11:31.306]  People care about the First Amendment.
[02:11:31.266 --> 02:11:36.327]  Now, I'm going to try to put 10 phone calls in in the next 15 minutes.
[02:11:36.347 --> 02:11:44.549]  So, Todd, you were talking about living across the river from Detroit in Canada in nuclear war and, you know, want to take care of your parents and everything.
[02:11:44.849 --> 02:11:49.270]  I would just say get right with God and, you know, the best thing you can do is just follow the Holy Spirit.
[02:11:49.810 --> 02:11:51.510]  Closing comments, Todd, appreciate you holding.
[02:11:53.071 --> 02:11:54.511]  Okay, thanks, Alex.
[02:11:54.951 --> 02:12:06.971]   Yeah, I mean, it seems more realistic than Maybe to hide out for a little while and suffer and die from radiation and starvation or marauding Mad Max type games.
[02:12:07.091 --> 02:12:11.495]  I saw in 1983, I was in grade 12, so I'm a little older than you.
[02:12:12.235 --> 02:12:18.361]  I remember seeing the day after and I just watched a clip of it yesterday with my mom.
[02:12:18.881 --> 02:12:25.927]  And I can't believe how realistic for 1983, almost 40 years ago, and how devastatingly real it seemed.
[02:12:27.096 --> 02:12:29.495]  I guess that's what's coming upon us.
[02:12:30.495 --> 02:12:34.736]   I agree and I meant to talk about this when I come on at 6 p.m. tonight we're
[02:12:34.736 --> 02:12:41.816]   gonna be joined by Steve Quayle to talk about nuclear war and then Robert Barnes
[02:12:42.421 --> 02:12:47.305]  But I'm going to cover FEMA camps, not just here but around the world, under the guise of COVID.
[02:12:47.325 --> 02:12:49.007]  We've got a whole report on it we haven't aired yet.
[02:12:49.528 --> 02:12:54.932]  And I'm also going to get into all the other different facets of the day after tomorrow.
[02:12:54.973 --> 02:12:56.534]  So, funny you mentioned that.
[02:12:56.734 --> 02:12:59.717]  That's coming up tonight when I come back and host at 6 p.m.
[02:13:01.378 --> 02:13:02.339]  Okay, thanks Alex.
[02:13:02.379 --> 02:13:03.360]  Thanks for everything you do.
[02:13:04.605 --> 02:13:09.047]  Pray to God that this goes away somewhere, de-escalates in some manner.
[02:13:09.508 --> 02:13:09.948]  Yes, sir.
[02:13:10.548 --> 02:13:12.309]  I love you, Tom, and we're in this together, brother.
[02:13:12.489 --> 02:13:13.410]  Give your parents my love.
[02:13:13.430 --> 02:13:15.771]  Alright, let's go to Melissa in Arizona.
[02:13:15.791 --> 02:13:16.711]  Melissa, you're on the air.
[02:13:16.751 --> 02:13:17.092]  Go ahead.
[02:13:18.252 --> 02:13:19.753]  Thank you, Alex, for taking my call.
[02:13:19.853 --> 02:13:24.355]  I just want to let you know that I'm blessed to be able to call in and support you and your show.
[02:13:24.415 --> 02:13:24.635]  Thank you.
[02:13:24.695 --> 02:13:26.757]  And that you are a beautiful and fine announcer.
[02:13:27.097 --> 02:13:27.397]  Thank you.
[02:13:27.987 --> 02:13:33.292]  I also want to let you know that your show has led to miraculous multiplication.
[02:13:33.352 --> 02:13:52.908]  We have a whole group off of the Getter Chat, Troll Management Inc., we have an Odyssey Channel under New Free Press, we have VMS Talk Show, who's been on with Owen, and we have a punk group, American Thought Criminals, that are all fighting in the resistance, and it's all come from your show.
[02:13:53.749 --> 02:13:55.250]  Well, that's all because of you supporting us.
[02:13:55.310 --> 02:13:56.011]  It's all of us together.
[02:13:57.645 --> 02:14:07.108]  So I was calling in today because I wanted to just echo the fact that Evil is launching an attack and it's not just, you know, at your level anymore.
[02:14:07.128 --> 02:14:11.610]  It's coming to us just as, you know, I'd say just regular people.
[02:14:11.690 --> 02:14:15.351]  I'm looking at an ad that was paid for by the Democrat Party.
[02:14:15.931 --> 02:14:19.552]  And it's addressed to me as a registered Republican on the front.
[02:14:20.032 --> 02:14:27.274]  Oh my gosh, my whole family that are Republicans, we're all getting Democrat text messages and emails we didn't sign up for.
[02:14:27.294 --> 02:14:37.997]  Absolutely, it says demonic across the front, I kid you not Alex, it says in huge letters demonic and there's a picture of a Ouija board under it.
[02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:55.245]  And the whole premise of this ad is that it's anti-Blake Masters, who is pro-abortion, and he recently said abortion is demonic, and instead of countering this argument, they've doubled down and embraced the people.
[02:14:55.305 --> 02:15:00.667]  Oh yeah, Democrats, the satanic groups, are in federal court saying, yes, killing babies is our religion.
[02:15:01.835 --> 02:15:13.686]  Absolutely, and they're shoving it in our face, and it's just an affront to Christianity, to faith, and it's an abomination to God and the lives of the children that have been sacrificed.
[02:15:13.826 --> 02:15:15.748]  Well, here's the good news, Melissa.
[02:15:16.489 --> 02:15:18.991]  Together, with God's help, we forced them out in the open.
[02:15:19.392 --> 02:15:23.075]  I mean, they're pro-pedophile, pro-nuclear war, pro-Satanism now.
[02:15:23.416 --> 02:15:24.677]  We have forced them out in the open.
[02:15:26.087 --> 02:15:38.955]  Absolutely and I think all that we can do is just rebuke this evil and I just felt it that it was on myself that I had to bring this to the light just to let people know that they're bringing the fight directly to us, to our mailbox.
[02:15:38.975 --> 02:15:42.917]  So they're sending Republican voters Ouija board Satanism emails.
[02:15:43.888 --> 02:15:44.088]  Yes.
[02:15:44.789 --> 02:15:45.770]  Not an email.
[02:15:45.911 --> 02:15:46.752]  I have a flyer.
[02:15:46.852 --> 02:15:48.414]  I'm holding this in my hand, Alex.
[02:15:48.754 --> 02:15:49.475]  Do me a favor.
[02:15:49.676 --> 02:15:55.844]  Scan it and message it to ShowTipsAndInfoWars.com.
[02:15:57.726 --> 02:15:58.207]  I believe you.
[02:15:58.247 --> 02:16:02.092]  These people know they're losing so they're just decloaking.
[02:16:02.984 --> 02:16:03.665]  They're out in the open.
[02:16:03.685 --> 02:16:04.265]  God bless you.
[02:16:04.345 --> 02:16:04.666]  Wow.
[02:16:04.806 --> 02:16:05.126]  Okay.
[02:16:06.307 --> 02:16:12.132]  Jimmy, Lisa, Brian, Jamie, Nathaniel, we're going to you in 60 seconds.
[02:16:12.673 --> 02:16:14.495]  And then Jay Dyer is always amazing.
[02:16:15.035 --> 02:16:16.576]  And then Owen Schroer for three hours.
[02:16:17.297 --> 02:16:18.298]  Does an incredible job.
[02:16:18.358 --> 02:16:19.459]  And then I'll be back 6 p.m.
[02:16:19.479 --> 02:16:20.480]  tonight with a bunch of big guests.
[02:16:20.940 --> 02:16:23.363]  Steve Quayle, Robert Barnes, a bunch of others tonight.
[02:16:25.250 --> 02:16:29.733]  You know, I'm really sorry to listeners that we have to be living in this time, but we told you it was coming.
[02:16:30.834 --> 02:16:35.497]  And this is the time that's gonna really separate the boys from the men.
[02:16:36.818 --> 02:16:37.639]  The women from the girls.
[02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:41.642]  Gonna jam in some final phone calls ahead of Jay Dyer.
[02:16:43.004 --> 02:16:44.886]  And as I said, we're going live until midnight tonight.
[02:16:45.867 --> 02:16:47.188]  This is an emergency broadcast.
[02:16:47.208 --> 02:16:48.109]  We're doing a fundraiser.
[02:16:48.970 --> 02:16:50.371]  God always keeps us honest here.
[02:16:50.411 --> 02:16:52.393]  We're always in the red, the black, back and forth.
[02:16:53.114 --> 02:16:54.395]  We got great products you already need.
[02:16:55.196 --> 02:16:56.397]  Big sales going on right now.
[02:16:56.477 --> 02:16:56.938]  Promo code 1776.
[02:16:56.978 --> 02:16:58.579]  There's an additional 10% off.
[02:17:00.370 --> 02:17:01.851]  The lowest sell is 40% off.
[02:17:02.331 --> 02:17:03.512]  The biggest sell is 50%.
[02:17:03.612 --> 02:17:07.814]  So that's 60% off with promo code 1776.com with many of the items.
[02:17:08.234 --> 02:17:09.174]  Double Patriot points.
[02:17:09.614 --> 02:17:10.435]  Biggest sell of the year.
[02:17:10.455 --> 02:17:14.016]  We've expanded it all to blow it all out with nuclear war and all this going on.
[02:17:14.036 --> 02:17:18.998]  We've got to have the funds to continue operating until the lights go off or until we avert this crisis.
[02:17:19.018 --> 02:17:20.419]  But you can feel it in your gut.
[02:17:21.279 --> 02:17:22.120]  You can feel it in your bones.
[02:17:23.621 --> 02:17:26.142]  I'd say 30% chance there's a limited nuclear war.
[02:17:26.962 --> 02:17:29.884]  And the problem with that number is most analysts agree with that number.
[02:17:30.604 --> 02:17:36.146]  Once you do that, it escalates full nuclear war like a 50, 60, 70% chance.
[02:17:37.027 --> 02:17:41.188]  There's only one country dropped nuclear bombs on people, atomic bombs, that's the US.
[02:17:44.238 --> 02:17:48.522]  I'd be lying to you if I told you that you might want to get ready to kiss your ass goodbye.
[02:17:48.962 --> 02:17:49.403]  That's okay.
[02:17:49.423 --> 02:17:49.923]  We live forever.
[02:17:49.963 --> 02:17:53.226]  We got souls that are eternal, but I'd be getting right with God right now.
[02:17:54.387 --> 02:17:55.348]  I mean, it's really that simple.
[02:17:55.808 --> 02:17:56.989]  All right, let's go to phone calls.
[02:17:57.049 --> 02:17:57.810]  Order there received.
[02:17:57.890 --> 02:17:58.811]  Jimmy in Ohio.
[02:17:59.251 --> 02:18:00.012]  Jimmy, thanks for holding.
[02:18:00.052 --> 02:18:00.712]  Brother, you're on the air.
[02:18:01.813 --> 02:18:04.155]  How you doing, sir?
[02:18:04.335 --> 02:18:06.657]  I'm completely just freaked out right now.
[02:18:07.867 --> 02:18:09.090]  Well, I get it.
[02:18:10.092 --> 02:18:11.074]  I'm a first-time caller.
[02:18:11.094 --> 02:18:13.059]  I've been listening to you since 2009.
[02:18:13.099 --> 02:18:14.903]  I'm kind of excited to bear with me.
[02:18:15.003 --> 02:18:15.585]  I love you, brother.
[02:18:15.625 --> 02:18:16.006]  Good to have you.
[02:18:17.068 --> 02:18:17.628]  Thank you.
[02:18:17.889 --> 02:18:21.151]  You are one of God's warriors, that's for sure.
[02:18:22.512 --> 02:18:37.343]  And I keep going back to the Star Wars thing and let me tell you, all I keep seeing is when we win, you receiving the medal like in Star Wars when they got the parade and the big parade and everybody's up there, you'll be one of them.
[02:18:37.803 --> 02:18:39.225]  General Flynn, probably another.
[02:18:40.505 --> 02:18:47.618]   But anyway, So, to your Star Wars thing, you know, you keep saying, well, you keep going back to Star Wars, but think about it.
[02:18:47.898 --> 02:18:50.020]  How did they defeat the Death Star?
[02:18:51.842 --> 02:18:54.724]  They got inside and took down the force field, right?
[02:18:55.225 --> 02:18:55.465]  Yes.
[02:18:55.545 --> 02:18:56.746]  So they could get the planes in.
[02:18:56.806 --> 02:18:59.428]  That's what they're doing here with America, right?
[02:18:59.468 --> 02:19:03.452]  They're taking down our force fields, which is our military, right?
[02:19:03.752 --> 02:19:06.795]  They're depleting the oil, depleting the fuel on the reserves.
[02:19:07.195 --> 02:19:08.436]  They're lowering our defenses.
[02:19:08.456 --> 02:19:09.257]  You're absolutely right.
[02:19:10.091 --> 02:19:18.275]  Yes, they're flooding the immigrants in with the terrorists and whoever else in there that they can control or whoever they got control of, right?
[02:19:18.835 --> 02:19:22.037]  I mean, you know, you think it weakened in the money system, if you think about it.
[02:19:22.997 --> 02:19:27.480]  You know, the money comes in, the immigrants come in, they give them the money, the free money.
[02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:29.241]  They turn around and spend it.
[02:19:29.281 --> 02:19:30.181]  Where do they spend it?
[02:19:30.321 --> 02:19:32.382]  Big companies, Amazon, whatever, right?
[02:19:32.442 --> 02:19:38.085]  So the money gets laundered right back into the big corporations, right?
[02:19:38.956 --> 02:19:40.898]  And they're so greedy they're going to start a nuclear war.
[02:19:41.699 --> 02:19:43.620]  Their money won't be worth anything once that happens.
[02:19:44.381 --> 02:19:50.927]  Yes, well, and that's the other thing I wanted to touch on about is to reaffirm your thing about God.
[02:19:50.987 --> 02:19:51.928]  God is amazing.
[02:19:52.008 --> 02:19:58.434]  If you just do for Him and give yourself to Him, you can get superpowers, literally.
[02:19:58.474 --> 02:20:01.297]  Like, I've slowed down time to save a dog.
[02:20:01.377 --> 02:20:02.919]  I mean, I've found dead bodies.
[02:20:02.959 --> 02:20:12.909]   Like, my mama, Tiny little woman stopped a car with two kids in it, me and my cousin, when we were little, rolling down a hill with super strength.
[02:20:13.880 --> 02:20:16.301]  And that's the story of, like, the djinn, right?
[02:20:16.361 --> 02:20:16.881]  The genie.
[02:20:17.261 --> 02:20:20.943]  You get the three wishes, but there's always a side effect, right?
[02:20:20.963 --> 02:20:23.644]  There's always a negative, because that's how the devil works, right?
[02:20:23.684 --> 02:20:24.804]  He wants something in return.
[02:20:25.404 --> 02:20:34.968]  When you just give yourself over to God, God gives you that power, but he's only going to give it the power to the people that are true, and he knows who's true by their heart.
[02:20:35.288 --> 02:20:36.108]  Powerful story.
[02:20:36.148 --> 02:20:37.069]  God bless you, Jimmy.
[02:20:37.689 --> 02:20:39.030]  Nathaniel in Alabama.
[02:20:39.070 --> 02:20:39.430]  Go ahead.
[02:20:39.450 --> 02:20:40.010]  Thanks for calling.
[02:20:41.573 --> 02:20:42.373]  Hey, Alex Wilde.
[02:20:42.393 --> 02:20:43.013]  Dream come true.
[02:20:44.314 --> 02:21:07.001]  So, I'm a prior Marine, recently got out because of the vaccine issue, and I'm irate right now because I just found out that one of my buddies, he submitted a religious exemption, just like I did, and they told him basically it was taking so long that they told him, well, you have to get it or we're gonna take you out of the unit.
[02:21:07.081 --> 02:21:09.882]  Even though a month ago they said no more shots free in the military.
[02:21:09.902 --> 02:21:10.502]  They're still doing it.
[02:21:11.360 --> 02:21:11.800]  Exactly.
[02:21:12.141 --> 02:21:18.644]  So he just, so he capitulated sometime last year and got it because they were going to take him out of the unit.
[02:21:19.264 --> 02:21:23.727]  And he just got his religious exemption back last week, accepted.
[02:21:25.768 --> 02:21:31.011]  That's right, they know it's outside law what they're doing, so they buffalo people into being conned into this.
[02:21:32.212 --> 02:21:43.133]   I know so many people who were threatened With things that were illegal to do, and they were forced to get this injection, and I'm on fire about it.
[02:21:44.313 --> 02:21:48.695]  They want control of our bodies, brother, and I'm sorry that happened to your friend.
[02:21:48.775 --> 02:21:49.855]  So I have a separate issue.
[02:21:50.175 --> 02:21:55.137]  I grew up as a Catholic, and as a conspiracy theorist, looking at my mom.
[02:21:55.997 --> 02:22:04.760]  She watched your show, me growing up, I was telling some of my middle school parents about heart and all that sort of stuff when I was in middle school.
[02:22:05.905 --> 02:22:12.449]  And it took me a while to get to trust your show because I was like, well, why would they allow him to stay on air?
[02:22:12.929 --> 02:22:17.912]  But because of all the attacks that you went through, I realized, I mean, you got to be the real deal.
[02:22:18.192 --> 02:22:20.173]  Well, brother, I wonder why I'm still on air.
[02:22:20.213 --> 02:22:20.833]  It's God.
[02:22:21.033 --> 02:22:22.054]  Evil's not all powerful.
[02:22:22.674 --> 02:22:24.095]  And they've really tried to destroy us.
[02:22:24.655 --> 02:22:25.436]  They know they kill us.
[02:22:25.496 --> 02:22:26.196]  It makes us smarter.
[02:22:26.216 --> 02:22:27.036]  I appreciate your call.
[02:22:27.537 --> 02:22:31.539]  In fact, I meant to get to one of the most important Gregory's reports ever.
[02:22:31.579 --> 02:22:32.980]  He filed today at Bandai Video.
[02:22:33.740 --> 02:22:38.824]  When I come back tonight, we're going to play weather weaponization and Hurricane Ian.
[02:22:39.304 --> 02:22:41.726]  It is extremely important and all admitted.
[02:22:42.386 --> 02:22:43.627]  So look for that tonight.
[02:22:43.687 --> 02:22:44.528]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:22:45.128 --> 02:22:46.269]  Lisa in Rhode Island.
[02:22:46.289 --> 02:22:46.789]  You're on the air.
[02:22:46.829 --> 02:22:47.190]  Go ahead.
[02:22:51.052 --> 02:22:51.533]  Hi, Lisa.
[02:22:52.233 --> 02:22:52.554]  Welcome.
[02:22:52.634 --> 02:22:52.914]  Hi.
[02:22:53.354 --> 02:22:54.015]  How are you?
[02:22:54.235 --> 02:22:54.535]  I'm good.
[02:22:54.555 --> 02:22:54.915]  Go ahead.
[02:22:57.557 --> 02:23:02.501]  I'd like to not talk about the war or, you know, the nuclear.
[02:23:03.942 --> 02:23:05.802]  Bombs that are going to take off.
[02:23:05.842 --> 02:23:06.223]  Yes, ma'am.
[02:23:06.263 --> 02:23:06.743]  You're on the air.
[02:23:06.783 --> 02:23:07.563]  Give us your take on it.
[02:23:10.244 --> 02:23:19.486]  As far as I'm concerned, at this point, we're in a lot of trouble with what, you know, the people in control are doing.
[02:23:19.546 --> 02:23:22.226]  But I don't even want to discuss that.
[02:23:22.547 --> 02:23:32.189]  I wanted to call and say thank you for saving my life and the rest of my family, my children, my grandchildren.
[02:23:33.024 --> 02:23:34.985]  With the information that you put out.
[02:23:35.766 --> 02:23:38.468]  Bought a lot of products.
[02:23:39.188 --> 02:23:39.949]  Got your book.
[02:23:40.049 --> 02:23:41.990]  Thank you for signing it.
[02:23:42.651 --> 02:23:44.292]  It was fantastic.
[02:23:45.273 --> 02:23:56.601]  And just to all the Rhode Island and Massachusetts people, get on Alex Jones and start buying the products because they're well worth it.
[02:23:57.631 --> 02:24:04.679]  Well I just appreciate you putting up with my begging all day because we don't have all this extra money they say we got and we're maxed out and I love the kernel of the word.
[02:24:04.699 --> 02:24:08.382]  Our most important work is about to happen so I thank you for doing your family's support.
[02:24:09.984 --> 02:24:19.214]  Alex I'm watching the whole showcase in Connecticut and it's insanity and let me tell you something.
[02:24:20.262 --> 02:24:24.703]  You're a true hero, and you really saved the lives of me and my grandkids.
[02:24:25.083 --> 02:24:25.964]  Well, I appreciate you.
[02:24:25.984 --> 02:24:31.725]  You notice we've not talked about the Texas Secretary of State attacking me and all this stuff saying I should be arrested.
[02:24:32.245 --> 02:24:33.206]  It's because I'm not worried about that.
[02:24:33.226 --> 02:24:34.126]  I'm worried about nuclear war.
[02:24:34.606 --> 02:24:36.907]  But yeah, we're the real deal, folks.
[02:24:36.927 --> 02:24:37.527]  There's real people.
[02:24:37.547 --> 02:24:38.167]  There's not just evil.
[02:24:38.587 --> 02:24:39.067]  You're real.
[02:24:39.107 --> 02:24:39.648]  You're listeners.
[02:24:40.128 --> 02:24:40.588]  You're real.
[02:24:40.628 --> 02:24:41.208]  You know you're real.
[02:24:41.308 --> 02:24:41.768]  I'm real, too.
[02:24:41.828 --> 02:24:42.928]  I'm 100% real, folks.
[02:24:43.489 --> 02:24:45.709]  And I love you, and I appreciate you, and thank you so much, Lisa.
[02:24:46.169 --> 02:24:50.139]   Jamie and Brian, if you give us your name and number, We got your name, but your number.
[02:24:50.539 --> 02:24:51.640]  I'll call you back tonight.
[02:24:52.020 --> 02:24:54.420]  I'm gonna be hosting like 6 to midnight with Owen Schroyer.
[02:24:54.800 --> 02:24:55.620]  Bunch of big guests.
[02:24:56.801 --> 02:24:58.081]  Jay Dyer's about to take over.
[02:24:58.641 --> 02:24:59.881]  Thank you all for your support.
[02:25:00.061 --> 02:25:02.502]  I hate to come to you and ask for support, but we won't be here if you don't support.
[02:25:03.022 --> 02:25:09.103]  We got promo code 1776 for 10% off on top of 40 to 50% off storewide.
[02:25:09.543 --> 02:25:10.384]  Inforestore.com.
[02:25:10.444 --> 02:25:13.464]  Some of the stuff that's being sold at cost at 60% off.
[02:25:14.524 --> 02:25:15.405]  Get your X3.

[02:25:22.238 --> 02:25:27.642]  All right, Jay Dyer takes over for the next 45 minutes.
[02:25:27.662 --> 02:25:29.523]  Then Owen Schroer, and like I said, I'll be back at 6 p.m.
[02:25:29.543 --> 02:25:29.864]  Central.
[02:25:30.364 --> 02:25:32.305]  Please magnify the broadcast.
[02:25:32.406 --> 02:25:33.166]  You are the power.
[02:25:33.486 --> 02:25:34.727]  You're the reason we're successful.
[02:25:35.108 --> 02:25:35.928]  Share the links tonight.
[02:25:35.968 --> 02:25:37.770]  Tell folks to tune in to this emergency broadcast.
[02:25:38.790 --> 02:25:44.715]  All right, Jay Dyer was set to host, but they just handed me a note during the break.
[02:25:46.599 --> 02:25:47.099]  And it is.
[02:25:47.219 --> 02:25:50.321]  Verdict will be read in about two minutes.
[02:25:51.882 --> 02:25:54.284]  So that's from my lawyer, Norm Pattis.
[02:25:54.344 --> 02:25:55.024]  It's being announced.
[02:25:55.585 --> 02:25:56.905]  They had a total show trial.
[02:25:58.006 --> 02:26:07.051]  They are now having the Secretary of State in Texas say they want to sue me for questioning the election, saying I unleashed hell on them.
[02:26:07.992 --> 02:26:09.253]  Didn't even question the Texas election.
[02:26:09.273 --> 02:26:10.074]  The Republicans won.
[02:26:10.894 --> 02:26:18.159]  But just total made-up crap where a public official, including an FBI agent, never said his name, don't know who his name, didn't even know who he was, so he sued me.
[02:26:18.640 --> 02:26:21.702]  Suing me for $550 million as part of this.
[02:26:21.722 --> 02:26:24.224]  They want $8.25 billion just in the first count.
[02:26:24.244 --> 02:26:24.944]  There's four counts.
[02:26:25.645 --> 02:26:27.026]  That's what the lawyers asked for last week.
[02:26:28.155 --> 02:26:34.555]   for questioning Sandy Hook. Never said the name of the FBI agent. So now bureaucrats can sue you under this precedent
[02:26:34.555 --> 02:26:41.754]   for asking questions. So they're about to announce the verdict. The jury took like four days of deliberation time,
[02:26:41.754 --> 02:26:44.365]  not counting the weekend, to come back. Here is the judge.
[02:26:44.365 --> 02:26:46.955]  Let's go to the audio of the biggest show trial in U.S.
[02:26:46.955 --> 02:26:49.895]   history with the jury. We'll see what happens. We'll see if they
[02:26:49.895 --> 02:26:51.755]  saw through it. I don't think they will.
[02:26:51.755 --> 02:26:53.755]  They're already told I'm guilty. Here it is.
[02:26:53.755 --> 02:27:00.155]   We have reached our unanimous verdict. Thank you. Exclamation point.
[02:27:00.094 --> 02:27:00.434]  Right?
[02:27:00.674 --> 02:27:01.094]  All set?
[02:27:04.435 --> 02:27:05.095]  Thank you for this.
[02:27:05.115 --> 02:27:06.175]  Did you give this to counsel?
[02:27:06.195 --> 02:27:06.395]  Yes.
[02:27:06.815 --> 02:27:07.776]  The judge looks pleased.
[02:27:08.776 --> 02:27:10.836]  Probably... $200 million?
[02:27:10.936 --> 02:27:13.597]  I don't have any money, so it's all a big joke.
[02:27:14.837 --> 02:27:15.617]  This is their trial.
[02:27:15.677 --> 02:27:16.338]  This is them on trial.
[02:27:18.398 --> 02:27:22.279]  There's Blumenthal's son, the anti-gun Democrat, running all this.
[02:27:23.959 --> 02:27:26.140]  Stolen valor, claimed it was in combat in Vietnam, never went there.
[02:27:29.153 --> 02:27:29.893]  Ambulance chaser.
[02:27:29.933 --> 02:27:30.754]  Cough scoff up there.
[02:27:30.774 --> 02:27:39.776]  This is ambulance chasing on steroids.
[02:27:41.557 --> 02:27:43.177]  Proud of our work exposing the deadly shot.
[02:27:43.578 --> 02:27:44.758]  Proud of our work exposing the world order.
[02:27:45.278 --> 02:27:46.138]  The war is all of it.
[02:27:46.178 --> 02:27:46.919]  So proud of our work.
[02:27:46.939 --> 02:27:53.281]  This is the devil coming after us.
[02:27:53.321 --> 02:27:54.081]  So pleased with the jury.
[02:27:58.281 --> 02:28:05.281]   And she gets to decide their cup of claim on false advertising too, so she can get me later anyways.
[02:28:05.281 --> 02:28:15.281]  This is their political jihad against freedom of speech.
[02:28:15.435 --> 02:28:17.056]  Good afternoon.
[02:28:19.778 --> 02:28:22.260]  Take your seats, please.
[02:28:22.800 --> 02:28:23.841]  I hope it's $50 billion.
[02:28:25.066 --> 02:28:26.167]  Make yourselves comfortable.
[02:28:26.207 --> 02:28:26.887]  Please be seated.
[02:28:27.247 --> 02:28:30.429]  Counsel will stipulate that our entire panel has returned.
[02:28:30.689 --> 02:28:30.910]  Yes.
[02:28:31.750 --> 02:28:32.030]  All right.
[02:28:32.110 --> 02:28:33.031]  Thank you for your note.
[02:28:33.071 --> 02:28:35.112]  I understand that you have reached a verdict.
[02:28:35.152 --> 02:28:36.873]  Mr. Ferraro, whenever you're ready, please.
[02:28:38.434 --> 02:28:42.457]  For exposing a crime.
[02:28:42.497 --> 02:28:43.537]  Your number is called.
[02:28:43.777 --> 02:28:44.718]  Please answer here.
[02:28:44.838 --> 02:28:46.079]  Rise and remain standing.
[02:28:46.419 --> 02:28:47.119]  Juror number one.
[02:28:47.139 --> 02:28:47.940]  Here.
[02:28:48.420 --> 02:28:49.201]  Juror number two.
[02:28:49.681 --> 02:28:49.961]  Here.
[02:28:50.361 --> 02:28:51.142]  Juror number three.
[02:28:51.642 --> 02:28:51.862]  Here.
[02:28:52.262 --> 02:28:52.943]  Juror number four.
[02:28:55.816 --> 02:28:57.077]  Here.
[02:28:58.937 --> 02:29:02.858]  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, in the case of Laffrey et al.
[02:29:02.998 --> 02:29:05.279]  v. Jones, Sherlach et al.
[02:29:05.479 --> 02:29:07.459]  v. Jones, and Sherlach et al.
[02:29:07.519 --> 02:29:12.541]  v. Jones, Sherlach, I'm sorry, have you agreed upon a verdict?
[02:29:14.161 --> 02:29:14.802]  Yes.
[02:29:15.202 --> 02:29:15.422]  Yes.
[02:29:16.422 --> 02:29:18.102]  Would you please pass the verdict to me?
[02:29:18.563 --> 02:29:20.563]  Then you can be seated.
[02:29:20.563 --> 02:29:31.563]   This is them absolving themselves of all the war crimes, everything.
[02:29:32.299 --> 02:29:33.399]  The media's good, I'm bad.
[02:29:33.740 --> 02:29:53.708]  For the verge of nuclear war, this is happening.
[02:29:54.788 --> 02:29:55.709]  I question the mass shooting.
[02:29:57.011 --> 02:29:57.971]  I question Jussie Smollett.
[02:29:58.391 --> 02:29:59.111]  WMD's in Iraq.
[02:30:02.512 --> 02:30:03.472]  I'm a thought criminal.
[02:30:04.792 --> 02:30:07.393]  Judge found me guilty, told the jury how guilty I was.
[02:30:07.393 --> 02:30:17.192]   She's pausing to give the media time to all dial in, to their full effect,
[02:30:17.192 --> 02:30:20.631]   try to give credibility to the corporate system again, which they'll never bring back.
[02:30:21.296 --> 02:30:23.136]  It's a dinosaur trying to be resurrected.
[02:30:26.143 --> 02:30:28.143]  Come on, crucify me, let's get it going.
[02:30:28.143 --> 02:30:38.143]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:30:38.143 --> 02:30:46.782]   After rigging this whole thing, not letting me put on evidence,
[02:30:46.782 --> 02:30:48.302]  have them put on fake evidence.
[02:30:48.302 --> 02:30:51.662]   After claiming I didn't give evidence, all the fraud, here we are down the line.
[02:30:51.662 --> 02:31:01.663]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:30:57.995 --> 02:30:59.516]  Look at little Blumenthal's kid right there.
[02:30:59.876 --> 02:31:02.457]  Look at him, look at him.
[02:31:02.477 --> 02:31:03.217]  People are pathetic.
[02:31:03.337 --> 02:31:04.657]  Their rule over this country is over.
[02:31:06.698 --> 02:31:07.538]  So proud of our work.
[02:31:09.139 --> 02:31:09.939]  So proud of your support.
[02:31:09.959 --> 02:31:12.240]  You get two years of appeals now.
[02:31:12.280 --> 02:31:12.940]  They won't shut us down.
[02:31:13.321 --> 02:31:13.821]  You support us.

[02:31:17.861 --> 02:31:19.861]  Fight these monsters.
[02:31:19.861 --> 02:31:25.861]  The judge just read through the four counts.
[02:31:25.861 --> 02:31:35.861]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:31:30.106 --> 02:31:30.886]  How about suspense?
[02:31:31.287 --> 02:31:32.968]  We're skipping the network break, coming up in three minutes.
[02:31:32.988 --> 02:31:34.628]  I'm just double-checking the map.
[02:31:34.708 --> 02:31:44.814]  So I am going to send you back with just very minor instruction, and I'm sorry for this, but I just want to make sure that we cross all the T's and dot all the I's.
[02:31:44.994 --> 02:31:54.999]  And as Attorney Patterson pointed out, I had asked you, you probably don't remember now because it was days ago, just to have the foreperson initial each page as well as sign.
[02:31:55.599 --> 02:31:58.580]  Also, I don't see any decimal points, and that's fine.
[02:31:58.600 --> 02:32:01.982]  It's consistent throughout, so we can leave it at that.
[02:32:02.082 --> 02:32:06.203]  So by that I mean there's no decimal point zero zero, but that is fine.
[02:32:06.243 --> 02:32:07.264]  I just wanted to point that out.
[02:32:07.304 --> 02:32:08.284]  Hundreds of millions per person.
[02:32:08.324 --> 02:32:14.867]  So we will send the jury back in with that, and then when you're ready we'll come back out.
[02:32:17.408 --> 02:32:19.609]  I don't see any decimal points.
[02:32:20.455 --> 02:32:35.963]  So that just told you, millions and millions, including an FBI agent, never said his name, don't know who he is, and that's why we have these headlines here in my stack, where the Texas Attorney General says, I unleashed hell by questioning the election.
[02:32:36.143 --> 02:32:37.384]  Didn't even question the Texas elections.
[02:32:37.844 --> 02:32:39.304]  Project Veritas did a good job of it.
[02:32:41.406 --> 02:32:42.506]  So, they're gonna come back.
[02:32:43.106 --> 02:32:52.076]   But now, oh, you talked bad about General topics, and if any random government official can now sue you for it.
[02:32:53.297 --> 02:32:58.581]  Well, I was going to skip this network break, but we don't need to now, so put it back in to function there.
[02:32:58.601 --> 02:33:03.065]  Yeah, we can for our stations, and we'll come back after the break on this.
[02:33:03.826 --> 02:33:05.007]  People are asking why I'm laughing.
[02:33:05.167 --> 02:33:06.468]  Folks, we're on the verge of nuclear war.
[02:33:06.869 --> 02:33:08.750]  They just killed 20 million people with poison shots.
[02:33:08.830 --> 02:33:09.611]  Billions are sick.
[02:33:09.991 --> 02:33:12.874]  Mainline News is reporting in, and they literally are mad at me.
[02:33:12.914 --> 02:33:13.975]  I questioned a mass shooting.
[02:33:14.657 --> 02:33:22.603]  That was political from the beginning, and I will continue to question Jesse Schmollett, or WMDs in Iraq, or Nord Stream Pipelines, or any of it.
[02:33:23.343 --> 02:33:26.126]  So I feel good about the work I've done, and the listeners need your support.
[02:33:27.086 --> 02:33:29.608]  This corrupt, dying political system wants to try to make me the devil.
[02:33:29.908 --> 02:33:33.911]  I'm not the devil, and God is my judge, not you globalist scumbags.
[02:33:35.432 --> 02:33:35.993]  It's that simple.
[02:33:36.453 --> 02:33:37.374]  InfoWars.com.

[02:33:43.446 --> 02:33:45.426]  For my own legal defense, I've got to pay for 40% of it.
[02:33:46.227 --> 02:33:49.387]  The bankruptcy court said we need about a half million the next year.
[02:33:49.707 --> 02:33:52.748]  We can, for two years, appeal this.
[02:33:52.768 --> 02:33:53.568]  We're not going anywhere.
[02:33:53.908 --> 02:33:55.989]  Nuclear World probably on the show before that, unfortunately.
[02:33:57.089 --> 02:33:58.809]  But keep us in attack formation.

[02:34:02.450 --> 02:34:02.570]  Woo!
[02:34:06.738 --> 02:34:08.279]  She said, you didn't add decimals here.
[02:34:08.299 --> 02:34:10.860]  I can't wait to actually love this.
[02:34:11.460 --> 02:34:12.861]  This is such a joke.
[02:34:13.261 --> 02:34:13.941]  We'll be right back.
[02:34:13.961 --> 02:34:14.401]  Stay with us.
[02:34:15.302 --> 02:34:20.724]  Well, we're awaiting the verdict where the jury was already told that I was guilty in Connecticut in the show trial.
[02:34:21.522 --> 02:34:26.826]  And I told people, despite the fact they were out four or five days, look for a giant billion dollar verdict.
[02:34:26.846 --> 02:34:30.469]  They asked for $8.25 billion just on one of their fake counts.
[02:34:31.510 --> 02:34:32.851]  No one even said Adam Lanza's name.
[02:34:32.871 --> 02:34:33.451]  It was all me.
[02:34:33.531 --> 02:34:34.892]  I killed the kids, all the rest of it.
[02:34:35.593 --> 02:34:37.554]  This is how desperate the establishment is.
[02:34:37.735 --> 02:34:38.875]  I am so honored.
[02:34:39.716 --> 02:34:40.596]  To have this happening.
[02:34:40.616 --> 02:34:45.979]  So we're waiting while the judge sent the jury back out because they didn't put decibels on how many billion I'm supposed to give.
[02:34:45.999 --> 02:34:48.080]  And that's why it's such a joke.
[02:34:48.120 --> 02:34:50.321]  I don't have two million dollars in cash.
[02:34:50.341 --> 02:34:51.642]  That's barely enough to run the operation.
[02:34:52.802 --> 02:34:53.622]  And so it's a joke.
[02:34:54.883 --> 02:34:56.084]  You are standing against them.
[02:34:56.464 --> 02:34:57.824]  You are standing against this fraud.

[02:35:01.466 --> 02:35:03.667]  That's how you resist getting great products at the same time.
[02:35:04.027 --> 02:35:05.168]  We will gonna appeal this.
[02:35:06.226 --> 02:35:11.348]  We're in such tyranny, they'll probably say no on the appeal, but two years left, whatever, we're on the edge of nuclear war, it doesn't even matter.
[02:35:11.668 --> 02:35:15.229]  It shows how tone deaf these people are.
[02:35:15.269 --> 02:35:17.430]  But I wanted to air a report, I said I would get to it, I didn't.
[02:35:17.830 --> 02:35:19.770]  Weather weaponization, Hurricane Ian.
[02:35:20.110 --> 02:35:21.771]  They want to 5G control your body.
[02:35:21.991 --> 02:35:23.652]  They want to poison injection control your body.
[02:35:23.912 --> 02:35:25.152]  They want to be able to control the weather.
[02:35:25.532 --> 02:35:28.853]  And they admit they're doing it all, but they say it's a conspiracy theory and we talk about it.
[02:35:29.013 --> 02:35:30.354]  Alright, so we can bring them back.
[02:35:30.374 --> 02:35:31.074]  Oh wait, they're coming back.
[02:35:32.294 --> 02:35:34.335]  Then we'll air the most important thing, weather weapon news.
[02:35:36.111 --> 02:35:36.491]  There we go.
[02:35:38.232 --> 02:35:39.673]  As she said, gotta add decibels.
[02:35:40.153 --> 02:35:46.376]  And boy, those ambulance chasers got happy when they heard that, including Senator Stolen Ballard Blumenthal got really excited.
[02:35:48.496 --> 02:35:50.958]  This is how they suppress America and the Midwest and Christians.
[02:35:50.978 --> 02:35:51.918]  They're so proud of themselves.
[02:35:53.959 --> 02:35:58.241]  This is how the collapsed globalist on the East Coast tries to rule America and you.
[02:35:59.161 --> 02:36:00.282]  They think they can break your will.
[02:36:00.121 --> 02:36:03.121]  they can't break your will.
[02:36:03.121 --> 02:36:21.320]   She was promoted to the head judge in the state just two months ago before this trial.
[02:36:20.507 --> 02:36:24.049]  Her sellout of this process and her weaponization of the judiciary.
[02:36:24.209 --> 02:36:25.129]  Thank you.

[02:36:43.493 --> 02:36:48.493]   They've already got the new Texas Silk ready for the question of the election.
[02:36:49.053 --> 02:36:52.838]  Unless council wants, do you want them recalled one more time by their number?
[02:36:52.858 --> 02:36:52.898]  No.
[02:36:53.459 --> 02:36:55.301]  I don't think it's necessary, but okay.
[02:36:55.361 --> 02:36:55.542]  No.
[02:36:55.781 --> 02:36:57.781]  And just bear with me, alright?
[02:36:57.781 --> 02:37:04.281]  Corrupt, guilty system.
[02:37:04.281 --> 02:37:07.281]   Wanted to scapegoat me as the bad guy when they're the bad guys.
[02:37:07.217 --> 02:37:07.918]  No one believes them.
[02:37:08.298 --> 02:37:09.678]  Everybody hates them and has half a brain.
[02:37:10.019 --> 02:37:10.919]  Their system's over.
[02:37:11.259 --> 02:37:11.759]  They know it.
[02:37:11.779 --> 02:37:12.780]  They're in full panic mode.
[02:37:12.599 --> 02:37:14.599]  This is exactly what I expected.
[02:37:14.599 --> 02:37:25.599]  And you put the decimal points in there.
[02:37:26.146 --> 02:37:27.226]  Oh, the decimal points in?
[02:37:28.246 --> 02:37:35.246]  Oh my god, 50 billion, 100 billion, trillion.
[02:37:35.246 --> 02:37:38.605]  They make these lies with all this money we've got.
[02:37:38.650 --> 02:37:41.614]  It's all just delusional, leftist crap.
[02:37:41.694 --> 02:37:42.775]  Like, two men can have a baby.
[02:37:45.278 --> 02:37:46.099]  Alright, Mr. Furrow?
[02:37:46.540 --> 02:37:48.663]  Same colt that wants to cut your son's balls off.
[02:37:50.145 --> 02:37:50.545]  Go Phil.

[02:42:26.378 --> 02:42:28.119]  Says all they want is some billion dollar number.
[02:42:28.139 --> 02:42:29.020]  This is ridiculous.
[02:42:29.080 --> 02:42:30.261]  I don't have two million dollars.

[02:43:30.693 --> 02:43:36.817]  I mean, this is the left completely out of control, doing whatever they want, like drag queen story time, two men can have a baby.
[02:43:36.837 --> 02:43:38.518]  I mean, this is what they do.

[02:43:57.970 --> 02:43:58.971]  Couldn't defend ourselves.
[02:43:59.131 --> 02:43:59.491]  I'm sorry!

[02:44:31.085 --> 02:44:34.605]   happened and now I'm the devil. I'm actually proud to be under this level
[02:44:34.605 --> 02:44:40.805]   of attack. 28 million eight hundred thousand dollars, initialed by juror number one.
[02:44:40.805 --> 02:44:43.925]  Suppose there's four charges.
[02:44:42.501 --> 02:44:50.010]  But remember, all of it's Kappa Kappa, which they claimed I had some unfair business trade.
[02:44:50.270 --> 02:44:51.412]  The judge decides that.
[02:44:51.291 --> 02:44:53.291]  that's where it doesn't matter.

[02:45:05.589 --> 02:45:07.710]  It should be trillions per person.
[02:45:08.210 --> 02:45:08.850]  I'm offended.
[02:45:09.691 --> 02:45:11.271]  This is what the hell's like.

[02:45:13.652 --> 02:45:18.672]  That's what hell's like. They just read out your damages.

[02:46:07.861 --> 02:46:09.361]  A, defamation...
[02:46:09.361 --> 02:46:10.861]  What do we got now, guys?
[02:46:10.861 --> 02:46:13.861]  ...damages past and future, $21 million.
[02:46:13.861 --> 02:46:15.861]  B, emotional distress...

[02:46:17.212 --> 02:46:17.913]  It's in the millions.
[02:46:18.053 --> 02:46:20.214]  By the way, they're fair and just.

[02:46:25.713 --> 02:46:27.634]  By the way, they're fair and just. He said that.

[02:49:04.231 --> 02:49:12.873]  Okay, so this is going to take hours and hours to hear about the billions and billions and billions I owe.
[02:49:13.293 --> 02:49:15.153]  Let's put up Drudge Report right now for people.
[02:49:16.634 --> 02:49:18.294]  Billion dollars owed by Alex Jones.
[02:49:19.034 --> 02:49:21.295]  I personally don't have two million dollars.
[02:49:21.675 --> 02:49:23.255]  The company's almost completely out of money.
[02:49:23.555 --> 02:49:24.335]  We're in bankruptcy.
[02:49:24.435 --> 02:49:25.196]  There's two appeals.
[02:49:25.216 --> 02:49:25.956]  It'll take years.
[02:49:26.316 --> 02:49:27.816]  There's caps on almost all of this.
[02:49:28.396 --> 02:49:31.477]  This is just completely, absolutely made up.
[02:49:32.097 --> 02:49:35.040]  And now the Democratic Party run, CNN bought it years ago.
[02:49:35.220 --> 02:49:36.060]  Literally, I was told that.
[02:49:37.001 --> 02:49:39.023]  Drudge Report is just up there celebrating this.
[02:49:39.463 --> 02:49:48.951]  They want to scare everybody away from freedom and scare us away from questioning Yuvaldi and what really happened there or Parkland or any other event.
[02:49:49.171 --> 02:49:49.632]  And guess what?
[02:49:49.672 --> 02:49:52.994]  We're not scared and we're not going away and we're not going to stop.
[02:49:53.915 --> 02:50:03.983]  And literally, for hundreds of thousands of dollars, I can keep them in court for years, I can appeal this stuff, we can stand up against this travesty, against the billions of dollars they want.
[02:50:04.083 --> 02:50:04.724]  It's a joke.
[02:50:05.344 --> 02:50:20.516]  So please, go to InfoWarsTore.com and get Vitamineral Fusion, get X3, get all the great products that are there that keep us on air at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:50:22.068 --> 02:50:22.868]  Or 888-253-3139.
[02:50:23.269 --> 02:50:26.790]  You want somebody to fight?
[02:50:28.371 --> 02:50:29.692]  We're going to get attacked for doing it.
[02:50:30.532 --> 02:50:31.573]  You want somebody to stand up?
[02:50:31.673 --> 02:50:32.353]  It's going to happen.
[02:50:32.813 --> 02:50:33.614]  They're going to come after us.
[02:50:36.462 --> 02:50:38.503]  But it's okay, because we're here.
[02:50:39.144 --> 02:50:41.225]  It's okay that Tim Cook runs death camps because he's gay.
[02:50:41.285 --> 02:50:42.606]  Remember that.
[02:50:42.726 --> 02:50:49.590]  So these are monsters, a dead system, the things that can demonize me, the head populace, and that'll make you all go away and be scared.
[02:50:49.610 --> 02:50:50.410]  But you're not scared.
[02:50:50.650 --> 02:50:51.411]  You're going to stand up.
[02:50:51.771 --> 02:50:54.873]  Flood us with donations at SaveInfoWars.com.
[02:50:55.173 --> 02:50:59.675]  Hundreds of thousands of dollars can beat their millions of Democratic Party money and all their frauds.
[02:51:00.076 --> 02:51:02.057]  And get products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:51:02.657 --> 02:51:09.860]  Like Vitamin Mineral Fusion and X3, 50% off promo code 1776, and that will save you another 10%.
[02:51:10.040 --> 02:51:13.162]  But whatever you do, share the articles, share the videos.
[02:51:13.662 --> 02:51:15.523]  Owen Schroer is going to take over with The War Room.
[02:51:15.863 --> 02:51:19.965]  I'll be back with Steve Quayle, Robert Barnes, and so many other big guests, 6 p.m.
[02:51:20.305 --> 02:51:24.006]  tonight for this Emergency Save Info Wars broadcast.
[02:51:24.126 --> 02:51:24.767]  And it's simple.
[02:51:25.347 --> 02:51:27.068]  Your pennies counter their millions.
[02:51:28.163 --> 02:51:28.926]  It's that simple.
[02:51:29.027 --> 02:51:29.649]  They're going to lose.
[02:51:29.669 --> 02:51:30.773]  They're going to lose the midterms.
[02:51:30.793 --> 02:51:32.339]  They're trying to launch a nuclear war.
[02:51:32.680 --> 02:51:33.965]  They are going to fail.
[02:51:35.137 --> 02:51:46.624]  These people are out of control, they have no chivalry, they have no bottom, they didn't have a case in their suit against us, so the judge found me guilty and then told the jury how guilty I was and wouldn't let us put on evidence.
[02:51:47.064 --> 02:51:49.445]  And my own lawyer's like, I think you might win, I think they were listening.
[02:51:49.486 --> 02:51:54.388]  I said, no, they're spending days deciding how many billions they're going to give them that doesn't exist.
[02:51:54.769 --> 02:51:55.629]  It's like inflation.
[02:51:56.049 --> 02:52:00.152]  As bad as inflation is, in a year or two, a billion dollars will be like a hundred dollars.
[02:52:01.696 --> 02:52:02.917]  All of this is vestigial.
[02:52:03.237 --> 02:52:04.438]  All this is ceremonial.
[02:52:04.979 --> 02:52:06.119]  All this is going away.
[02:52:06.139 --> 02:52:07.080]  All this is over.
[02:52:07.300 --> 02:52:11.924]  Like the fake college degrees and the 401Ks and the systems.
[02:52:12.084 --> 02:52:14.265]  None of it means anything.
[02:52:16.087 --> 02:52:20.810]  So I'm so honored to be here on air and laughing at this because they have used these families.
[02:52:20.850 --> 02:52:23.832]  They have squeezed them to sue Remington and do all this other crap.
[02:52:24.252 --> 02:52:25.934]  And now they're coming after your free speech.
[02:52:26.254 --> 02:52:30.157]  Now they're coming after your right to listen to what you want and hear what you want.
[02:52:31.095 --> 02:52:33.957]  So, these ambulance chasers love being all over TV.
[02:52:33.997 --> 02:52:34.817]  They don't have any money.
[02:52:35.338 --> 02:52:36.438]  They don't care about that.
[02:52:36.478 --> 02:52:37.799]  They're using those families.
[02:52:38.400 --> 02:52:40.021]  Who, a 73 million?
[02:52:40.101 --> 02:52:40.561]  Not enough.
[02:52:40.981 --> 02:52:42.102]  They need more.
[02:52:42.622 --> 02:52:43.983]  They need more money.
[02:52:44.703 --> 02:52:49.066]  America is at fault that Adam Lanza was on Prozac and went and killed people.
[02:52:49.266 --> 02:52:50.647]  And Alex Jones is at fault.
[02:52:51.448 --> 02:52:52.208]  It's weakness.
[02:52:52.268 --> 02:52:54.950]  It's not strength that's causing them to do this.
[02:52:54.970 --> 02:52:56.471]  So, you want to counterbalance them?
[02:52:57.768 --> 02:53:00.210]  Flood SaveInfoWars.com with donations.
[02:53:00.270 --> 02:53:01.351]  I want to thank those who did it.
[02:53:01.651 --> 02:53:02.632]  SaveInfoWars.com.
[02:53:02.932 --> 02:53:07.516]  Go to InfoWars.com and get the X3 and see what it does for your body.
[02:53:07.876 --> 02:53:09.057]  Get the Vitamineral Fusion.
[02:53:09.397 --> 02:53:10.698]  Get the DNA Force Plus.
[02:53:11.139 --> 02:53:12.360]  Whatever you do, tell everybody you know.
[02:53:12.660 --> 02:53:19.745]  Tune in to the man that's the most demonized, the most attacked, because we're telling the truth at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:53:20.646 --> 02:53:24.490]  And get the signed copy you have on your bookshelf, a piece of history or a non-signed copy.
[02:53:25.091 --> 02:53:29.336]  But get the fundraiser copy at InfoWarsTore.com with the Great Reset and the War for the World.
[02:53:29.896 --> 02:53:31.018]  InfoWars.com.
[02:53:31.518 --> 02:53:32.539]  NewsWars.com.
[02:53:33.060 --> 02:53:33.961]  Band.Video.
[02:53:34.321 --> 02:53:35.483]  I knew this was coming.
[02:53:35.983 --> 02:53:37.525]  I told you it'd be a billion dollar verdict.
[02:53:38.305 --> 02:53:43.249]  It's a joke to psychologically manipulate you to break your will and make you give up.
[02:53:43.609 --> 02:53:54.796]  The fact that this attack is so huge, the attack of this is so massive and so disproportionate and so ridiculous shows how weak these ambulance chasers are.
[02:53:54.816 --> 02:54:00.380]  Because that's what the Democratic Party is, is a bunch of lawyers that hate America, who want to destroy our country.
[02:54:00.900 --> 02:54:02.081]  They're good lawyers or bad lawyers.
[02:54:02.101 --> 02:54:02.801]  These are the bad lawyers.
[02:54:04.355 --> 02:54:05.156]  Want to commend the crew?
[02:54:05.517 --> 02:54:06.598]  Want to commend the listeners and viewers?
[02:54:06.998 --> 02:54:08.560]  Owen Schroer is loaded for bear.
[02:54:08.881 --> 02:54:12.065]  He'll have more of this coming up in just two minutes after break with The War Room.
[02:54:12.085 --> 02:54:17.792]  If your local station doesn't carry it, InfoWars.com forward slash show and band out video.
[02:54:17.812 --> 02:54:26.298]   The War Room with Owen Schroer and our emergency 16 hour plus broadcast that goes on to midnight tonight is live now.
[02:54:26.818 --> 02:54:27.898]  Override their tyranny.
[02:54:28.319 --> 02:54:29.319]  Override their censorship.
[02:54:29.359 --> 02:54:31.060]  Everybody you know on text messages, email, you name it.
[02:54:31.360 --> 02:54:34.561]  Tune in now to mfowars.com forward slash show.
[02:54:34.701 --> 02:54:35.341]  Great job.
[02:54:35.701 --> 02:54:36.582]  I love you all.
[02:54:36.601 --> 02:54:46.561]  We'll be right back.
[02:54:47.270 --> 02:54:50.352]  In fact, I've gone through a lot of attacks, a lot of degradation, to tell the truth.
[02:54:51.192 --> 02:54:53.333]  But I am somebody that doesn't like to beg.
[02:54:54.234 --> 02:54:56.135]  And I'm somebody that doesn't like to bother people.
[02:54:57.275 --> 02:55:11.722]  But you know, if I don't bother you now, if I don't push you now to fight for freedom even harder, we're gonna have the globalists, these control freaks, satanists, and pedophiles ruling our lives and ruling the lives of our children and innocent people.
[02:55:12.847 --> 02:55:22.829]  So I can override my instinct not to beg, and my instinct not to plead, and my instinct not to be annoying, and just tell you, who's delivered like Infowars?
[02:55:23.549 --> 02:55:26.549]  Who's had an effect against the New World Order as big as we have?
[02:55:26.569 --> 02:55:27.870]  And the answer is nobody.
[02:55:27.890 --> 02:55:32.050]  And it's because we have you, an incredible audience of activists that have done an amazing job.
[02:55:32.590 --> 02:55:34.271]  So, so much of our mission is completed.
[02:55:34.331 --> 02:55:42.632]   I'd say 90% of the work we set out to do, exposing the New World Order, preparing folks for their attack, getting people ready to fight back, is now bearing fruit.
[02:55:42.852 --> 02:55:44.453]  We're having incredible successes everywhere.
[02:55:44.713 --> 02:55:50.976]  Nationalists, populists, anti-New World Order folks getting elected, the globalists in full panic mode, their poison shot agenda falling apart.
[02:55:51.196 --> 02:55:51.896]  The list goes on and on.
[02:55:52.756 --> 02:56:02.740]  But now we reach the critical part of the fight, where the deep state is targeting all the leadership of the resistance, and they see InfoWars as the very tip of the spear they want to blunt.
[02:56:03.441 --> 02:56:06.622]  So I want to ask you all to support InfoWars now more than ever.
[02:56:07.082 --> 02:56:11.024]  Now I've run some fundraisers in the past for legal defense funds for free speech and InfoWars.
[02:56:11.704 --> 02:56:13.445]  We've got that basically paid for now.
[02:56:14.126 --> 02:56:16.247]  But courts have ruled I've got to pay my legal fees.
[02:56:16.387 --> 02:56:16.948]  I don't have the money.
[02:56:17.568 --> 02:56:18.589]  So I need your support.
[02:56:19.169 --> 02:56:24.813]  Please go to SaveInfoWars.com today and make a donation on GiveSendGo, whether it's $5, $10, or $100.
[02:56:27.054 --> 02:56:29.515]  So that I personally continue to battle.
[02:56:29.775 --> 02:56:32.756]  We're so close to victory, but I know this, we're not giving up.
[02:56:33.136 --> 02:56:34.496]  So please help me not give up.
[02:56:34.836 --> 02:56:37.997]  Please take action now at SaveInfoWars.com.
[02:56:38.338 --> 02:56:43.339]  SaveInfoWars.com for the first time ever and donate directly to me so I can stay in the fight.
[02:56:43.459 --> 02:56:43.799]  Thank you.
[02:56:44.039 --> 02:56:46.720]  You've been encouraging your audience to give you money, right?
[02:56:48.121 --> 02:56:48.921]  Yes, like media.
[02:56:49.001 --> 02:56:50.081]  I raise money to stay on air.
[02:56:50.401 --> 02:56:59.537]   And the most recent website you've been encouraging your audience to donate at is 1776coin.com, right?
[02:57:01.178 --> 02:57:03.019]  Well, it's where you can buy silver coins.
[02:57:04.480 --> 02:57:07.422]  1776coin.com is the website, right?
[02:57:07.862 --> 02:57:08.143]  Yes.
[02:57:08.443 --> 02:57:12.185]  It's the fourth coin that we've released in the last year.
[02:57:12.926 --> 02:57:14.107]  And I believe the most powerful.
[02:57:14.547 --> 02:57:17.589]  The man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt.
[02:57:19.150 --> 02:57:20.551]  Citizen of a republic.
[02:57:21.696 --> 02:57:22.576]  Man in the arena.
[02:57:23.137 --> 02:57:25.158]  There's only 10,000 of this coin.
[02:57:25.498 --> 02:57:26.538]  It exists in the world.
[02:57:26.979 --> 02:57:28.539]  It will never be made again.
[02:57:28.559 --> 02:57:31.181]  It's not just an amazing historic coin.
[02:57:31.601 --> 02:57:34.842]  It funds the information war against the globalists.
[02:57:35.182 --> 02:57:37.363]  This is something you want to hand down to your grandchildren.
[02:57:37.724 --> 02:57:38.924]  This is something you want to own.
[02:57:39.444 --> 02:57:44.667]  And as a fundraiser, it is funding the information war against the globalists.
[02:57:45.227 --> 02:57:47.568]  Ladies and gentlemen, 10,000 coins are available.
[02:57:47.588 --> 02:57:48.629]  They'll sell out very quickly.
[02:57:49.309 --> 02:57:52.010]  Please be part of history, and thank you all for your support.

[02:58:04.532 --> 02:58:06.253]  Man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt.
[02:58:06.753 --> 02:58:07.073]  1776coin.com.
[02:58:07.133 --> 02:58:08.273]  Anyway, back to this coin.
[02:58:08.333 --> 02:58:11.974]  This is what you've been asking your audience to give you money for.
[02:58:11.994 --> 02:58:12.634]  This is it, right?
[02:58:13.714 --> 02:58:16.375]  We actually started making these coins six months ago.
[02:58:17.435 --> 02:58:20.397]  But what you're running right now, this week, is you've been talking about this trial.
[02:58:21.037 --> 02:58:26.220]  After you said it, you're sending them to 1776coin.com, right?
[02:58:26.440 --> 02:58:33.804]  Yes, that's where we sell the collectible coins for people that want to keep the show on the air.
[02:58:34.225 --> 02:58:34.885]  Okay.
[02:58:35.025 --> 02:58:38.747]  And did you tell Brittany Paz about that revenue platform?
[02:58:40.168 --> 02:58:41.349]  We advertise it on air, yeah.
