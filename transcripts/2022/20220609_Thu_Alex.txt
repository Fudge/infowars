[00:00:00.302 --> 00:00:12.653]  And isn't it amazing how with the Uvalde shooting, it's the gun's fault, but in the Kenosha situation where Kyle Rittenhouse defended his life against violent criminals, it was his fault.
[00:00:13.573 --> 00:00:14.874]  Isn't that amazing?
[00:00:14.954 --> 00:00:15.735]  Liberal logic.
[00:00:15.935 --> 00:00:17.476]  It's not logic, it's propaganda.
[00:00:18.216 --> 00:00:18.717]  How do you know?
[00:00:18.777 --> 00:00:20.418]  Because it can't be applied universally.
[00:00:21.018 --> 00:00:23.980]  It's the easiest test to find out whether it's logic or propaganda.
[00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.701]  Can it be applied universally?
[00:00:25.862 --> 00:00:27.283]  If not, it's propaganda.
[00:00:27.623 --> 00:00:28.603]  It's liberalism.
[00:00:29.764 --> 00:00:35.628]  Here are some of the laws that passed in the House last night.
[00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:40.652]  They've got an uphill battle in the Senate, but if they get even one of these passed, it'll be bad for America.
[00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:42.899]  U.S.
[00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:51.847]  House of Representatives votes to criminalize disassembling, cleaning, and reassembling your gun without a firearm manufacturer's license.
[00:00:53.088 --> 00:00:53.328]  What?
[00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.290]  What?
[00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.111]  That is insanity.
[00:00:57.652 --> 00:00:58.873]  You can't clean your gun?
[00:00:58.913 --> 00:01:02.055]  You can't take apart and reassemble your gun unless you have a license?
[00:01:02.676 --> 00:01:02.956]  What?
[00:01:05.478 --> 00:01:09.922]  That doesn't even make any sense, not to mention it's dangerous not to clean your firearm.
[00:01:11.411 --> 00:01:12.571]  Passed in the house.
[00:01:13.392 --> 00:01:14.212]  Makes no sense at all.
[00:01:14.872 --> 00:01:23.254]  They also passed bills that said you have to have some sort of a storage for your firearm.
[00:01:23.954 --> 00:01:26.695]  Your magazine cannot be in your firearm.
[00:01:27.135 --> 00:01:38.838]  So remember, they passed laws, like for example, how if you're in your vehicle, some states you cannot have a loaded gun and you cannot even have the gun next to the ammo.
[00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:40.479]  It has to be completely separately stored.
[00:01:41.272 --> 00:01:45.316]  Oh okay, so criminal comes to rob your car, rob you at gunpoint.
[00:01:46.317 --> 00:01:56.827]  You're gonna say, excuse me sir, I have a gun legally stashed in my glove compartment, locked away as the law says, and my magazine with my ammo is in the back of my trunk.
[00:01:57.167 --> 00:02:05.935]  Would you mind just holding right there while I unlock my glove compartment and then go into my trunk and load my weapon so that I can defend myself against you right now?
[00:02:05.975 --> 00:02:06.495]  Would you mind that?
[00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.391]  That's insanity, but that's the law.
[00:02:09.591 --> 00:02:11.192]  That's what we're doing right now.
[00:02:11.493 --> 00:02:13.194]  Now they're doing the same thing in your house.
[00:02:15.236 --> 00:02:19.580]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.320]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.140]  The Defense of Human Liberty.
[00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.140]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:34.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, Ron DeSantis gets it.
[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:45.140]   Here he is yesterday, during a press conference, talking about how to deal with the corrupt liberal mainstream media.
[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.600]  media.
[00:02:47.527 --> 00:02:54.032]  I am not deterred by any smear piece from these legacy media outlets.
[00:02:54.632 --> 00:03:02.717]  The only reason they're attacking her is because she does a great job, and she's very effective at calling out their lies and their phony narratives.
[00:03:02.917 --> 00:03:09.502]  And so, whenever they're smearing somebody, you know that person is over the target, and so they're scared of that.
[00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:16.322]   I would be much more concerned with my press secretary if the Washington Post was writing puff pieces about her.
[00:03:16.322 --> 00:03:18.322]  Then I would think something's wrong.
[00:03:18.322 --> 00:03:21.322]  [Applause]
[00:03:21.322 --> 00:03:28.322]   The thing you need to understand with these legacy DC/New York outlets is we don't care what you think anymore.
[00:03:29.173 --> 00:03:31.514]  We know you peddle narratives.
[00:03:31.734 --> 00:03:32.914]  We know you lie.
[00:03:33.155 --> 00:03:34.875]  We know you don't care about the facts.
[00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:39.798]  And so you can try to smear me or anyone in my administration all you want to.
[00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:45.280]  All that's going to do is embolden us to continue moving forward for the people of Florida.
[00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:48.934]  And so he said the important part already.
[00:03:50.255 --> 00:03:52.776]  We don't care what you think anymore.
[00:03:53.816 --> 00:04:15.487]  Now, he's addressing the mainstream media there, the leftist media there, because they've been attacking his press secretary, Christina Pushaw, who's a wonderful lady, and DeSantis, Pushaw, and the rest just are unfazed, and that's why he comes out and he says, look, we don't care what you say anymore.
[00:04:17.327 --> 00:04:23.075]  That is the correct leap to take right now and he's landed safely on the stone.
[00:04:23.256 --> 00:04:32.829]  But there's still one more stone and one more leap to take to complete this process because it's understanding that the leftist liberal mainstream media is the Democrat Party.
[00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.232]  They are Democrat Party activists.
[00:04:35.292 --> 00:04:36.252]  It's all one and the same.
[00:04:36.553 --> 00:04:42.497]  It's all one corrupt body of criminal behavior set to destroy America.
[00:04:42.537 --> 00:04:43.218]  That's their goal.
[00:04:43.778 --> 00:04:45.120]  That's why Obama's their leader.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.943]  That's why he was influenced by the Weather Underground and Bill Ayers and Kathy Boudin.
[00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.862]  No, people are starting to learn about it now because of Chess and Boudin's recall.
[00:04:52.882 --> 00:05:03.249]  But see, once you realize that the mainstream media and the Democrat Party is all the same, and once you take that same approach of, we don't care what you say anymore, we don't care what you think anymore, that's victory.
[00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.111]  That's the path to victory.
[00:05:05.911 --> 00:05:21.497]  Stop letting these liars, stop letting these crooks, stop letting these criminals, stop letting these scumbags dictate how we think, how we feel based off the threats that they may have or based off their big media, mainstream media hit pieces that they may put out.
[00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.352]  That's the correct approach to take mentally.
[00:05:24.692 --> 00:05:25.873]  We don't care what you say.
[00:05:26.033 --> 00:05:27.134]  We don't care what you print.
[00:05:27.214 --> 00:05:28.535]  We don't care what you think.
[00:05:29.076 --> 00:05:30.156]  You're the scumbags.
[00:05:30.417 --> 00:05:31.317]  We're the good guys.
[00:05:31.798 --> 00:05:35.801]  We're going to go on doing what we're doing here to save this country and help Americans out.
[00:05:36.181 --> 00:05:42.787]  You keep doing what you're doing, which is the criminal deception and lying to the American people.
[00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:57.405]  So we're almost there, folks, and I think DeSantis is now really, to me, starting to make leaps and bounds over even Donald Trump as we move towards the midterms and into the next presidential election.
[00:05:57.445 --> 00:06:00.609]  But there's a candidate, Trump-endorsed Blake Masters, who understands this.
[00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:03.212]  Now, they're lying about what happened at this event.
[00:06:04.103 --> 00:06:08.264]   a deranged leftist showed up to protest at a Blake Masters event
[00:06:08.264 --> 00:06:14.334]   and here's the video of that and I'll tell you what really happened and how he was lied about in the media but here's
[00:06:14.334 --> 00:06:32.103]   the video [crowd noise]
[00:06:32.103 --> 00:06:39.384]   and so a deranged leftist went to a Blake Masters event and started causing trouble
[00:06:39.683 --> 00:06:41.024]  And he shoved a woman.
[00:06:41.664 --> 00:06:47.309]  And so, of course, the media said they attacked Blake Masters and they said, oh look, Blake Masters attacked a 73-year-old man.
[00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:48.770]  Wow, Blake Masters is such a bad guy.
[00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:50.651]  Well, turns out they got it wrong again.
[00:06:50.792 --> 00:06:53.854]  Actually, that 73-year-old man was a sex offender.
[00:06:54.034 --> 00:06:56.156]  He's a sex offender.
[00:06:56.696 --> 00:07:00.559]  And he actually shoved an elderly woman before anything happened.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.462]  So yeah, the media lied about Blake Masters.
[00:07:03.482 --> 00:07:04.382]  They got it wrong again.
[00:07:04.502 --> 00:07:07.785]  Blake Master doesn't care what lying, corrupt, criminal Democrats say.
[00:07:08.045 --> 00:07:09.366]  He doesn't care about the mainstream media.
[00:07:09.426 --> 00:07:17.652]  Good for Blake Masters for protecting an innocent old lady from a deranged sexual abuser leftist that tried to crash his event.
[00:07:18.012 --> 00:07:18.373]  Wow!
[00:07:19.593 --> 00:07:22.436]  Here we are on this Thursday, June 9, 2022.
[00:07:24.895 --> 00:07:35.523]  And the Democrats are about to have their sham hearings tonight about January 6th, a made-for-TV event, an event, a movie if you will, almost two years in the making.
[00:07:36.397 --> 00:07:45.901]  Democrats have done everything they possibly could in the last year and a half to drum up and create as much evidence that they possibly can.
[00:07:45.941 --> 00:07:59.506]  They have none, so they have to go through millions of texts and emails and everything from thousands of different individuals, of which I'm sure they'll cherry-pick three or four out of and say, see, look at this, take it totally out of context to prove their point.
[00:08:00.586 --> 00:08:05.527]  They'll probably find someone in the Proud Boys using a racial slur or something like that.
[00:08:05.547 --> 00:08:06.768]  They'll say, look, they're racists.
[00:08:07.988 --> 00:08:25.793]  And of course, they scrubbed the thousands of hours of video footage from the Capitol that day that shows it was Antifa breaking into the Capitol, smashing the windows, getting into confrontations with police, breaking down the barriers before any Trump supporters.
[00:08:26.792 --> 00:08:27.712]  When over barriers.
[00:08:27.813 --> 00:08:32.295]  It was Antifa that first had that push.
[00:08:34.056 --> 00:08:35.756]  But OK, we all know that story.
[00:08:35.857 --> 00:08:37.057]  We all know the big lies.
[00:08:37.137 --> 00:08:41.099]  We all know everybody that died on January 6th was Trump supporters killed by police.
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.001]  So we can rehash that as much as possible.
[00:08:45.061 --> 00:08:48.063]  But imagine that now.
[00:08:48.503 --> 00:08:49.443]  You don't have to imagine.
[00:08:50.844 --> 00:08:54.126]  That juxtaposed with what we just had yesterday.
[00:08:55.051 --> 00:09:04.619]  Where a Democrat went to Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's house to assassinate him.
[00:09:07.721 --> 00:09:15.107]  So Democrats are having their sham January 6th hearing tonight as Democrats are out in front of Supreme Court Justice's house trying to murder them.
[00:09:17.009 --> 00:09:26.170]   And they're telling you that Republicans and Trump And white people are the problem, as they're literally the most violent terrorists in the country.
[00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:33.812]  And, you know, I don't want to belabor this point, because I really need to cover this news sufficiently today.
[00:09:34.132 --> 00:09:39.533]  But there's something that needs to be understood about the modern-day Democrat Party.
[00:09:39.853 --> 00:09:45.114]  And I'm really not sure where Biden falls into this, other than just being a total puppet.
[00:09:45.994 --> 00:09:50.835]  I'm really not sure where Pelosi falls into this, other than just being a total criminal.
[00:09:52.950 --> 00:10:09.604]  But what is actually happening now in the Democrat Party is that violent radical revolutionaries have taken control of the party and Barack Hussein Obama is the leader.
[00:10:10.705 --> 00:10:20.375]   Barack Hussein Obama was influenced by radical communists and terrorists Like Kathy Boudin and Bill Ayers.
[00:10:21.216 --> 00:10:32.358]  Barack Obama launched his political campaign from the wings of the Weather Underground, a known terrorist group that robbed banks, killed police officers and burned buildings to the ground.
[00:10:33.778 --> 00:10:38.539]  That is the cloth, that is the thread that Barack Obama comes from.
[00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:44.120]  And that is now where all the ideology of the Democrat Party is trickling down from.
[00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:54.354]  And so that's why you're seeing the Democrats and the liberal left become more anti-American, more communist, more criminal, more terroristic than ever before.
[00:10:54.954 --> 00:10:56.535]  That's the Obama effect.
[00:10:56.875 --> 00:10:58.155]  That's the Boudin effect.
[00:10:58.575 --> 00:11:00.516]  That's the Weather Underground effect.
[00:11:02.077 --> 00:11:05.558]  Now everything I've just said to you is fact, folks.
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.281]  So, that needs to be understood.
[00:11:13.991 --> 00:11:20.517]  And Obama's really running Biden, I think, or in some way, shape, or form, he is running a lot of the White House policy right now.
[00:11:22.399 --> 00:11:24.941]  But so let's come back to where we're at today.
[00:11:26.723 --> 00:11:47.827]   Just hours after a Democrat terrorist was arrested outside of Brett Kavanaugh's house, attempting to assassinate a Supreme Court Justice, Democrats sent another hundred protesters out in front of Kavanaugh's house and in front of Justice Roberts' house.
[00:11:48.988 --> 00:11:51.290]  And that footage is right there on the screen for you.
[00:11:52.512 --> 00:12:02.770]   So even after the terrorist gets caught The Democrat terrorist gets caught after trying to assassinate a Supreme Court Justice.
[00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:14.214]  The Democrats still go outside of his house and go outside of other Supreme Court Justices' house, raising their ruckus, making their threats, and doing their normal activity.
[00:12:16.074 --> 00:12:24.037]  Now, can you imagine if on January 7th, 2021, Trump supporters decided to go back to the Capitol?
[00:12:25.168 --> 00:12:28.391]  Could you imagine the uproar and the outrage?
[00:12:28.671 --> 00:12:33.755]  Of course, Trump supporters left the Capitol that day when they were asked to and told to.
[00:12:35.536 --> 00:12:39.199]  But oh, Democrat terrorist gets caught trying to assassinate a Supreme Court justice.
[00:12:39.239 --> 00:12:40.240]  What's the Democrat response?
[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.361]  Send more!
[00:12:42.062 --> 00:12:43.223]  Send reinforcements!
[00:12:43.303 --> 00:12:44.103]  Send backup!
[00:12:44.183 --> 00:12:44.844]  Don't stop!
[00:12:45.064 --> 00:12:46.005]  Keep up the pressure!
[00:12:48.254 --> 00:12:49.735]  And we've got all kinds of examples.
[00:12:49.936 --> 00:12:51.797]  Nancy Pelosi calling for violence.
[00:12:51.857 --> 00:12:53.619]  Maxine Waters calling for violence.
[00:12:53.779 --> 00:12:55.461]  Lori Lightfoot calling for violence.
[00:12:56.201 --> 00:12:57.723]  Joe Biden calling for violence.
[00:12:58.083 --> 00:13:01.026]  And this is just their own logic.
[00:13:02.707 --> 00:13:04.169]  This is just their own words.
[00:13:04.189 --> 00:13:05.290]  This is just their own rhetoric.
[00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:06.491]  This is just their own activity.
[00:13:08.212 --> 00:13:19.946]   But you now live in the America Where Democrats are allowed to be openly domestic terrorists, and conservatives aren't even allowed to open their mouth.
[00:13:21.907 --> 00:13:36.156]  Where you have hundreds of political prisoners being held by the Democrat Party right now, just for a political stunt, ruining people's lives, as they send their own people out to terrorize and murder their political opposition.
[00:13:38.564 --> 00:13:39.664]  Who killed Ashley Babbitt?
[00:13:40.425 --> 00:13:41.985]  Who killed the Trump supporter in Portland?
[00:13:42.025 --> 00:13:43.486]  Who killed the Trump supporter in Denver?
[00:13:44.286 --> 00:13:45.947]  Who is James Hodgkinson?
[00:13:48.027 --> 00:13:52.109]  See, the Democrat media doesn't make a big thing of these stories, do they?
[00:13:53.309 --> 00:13:55.750]  The Democrat media doesn't want you to know about their terrorists.
[00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:57.991]  Remember the Waukesha massacre?
[00:13:58.111 --> 00:13:58.811]  They buried that.
[00:13:58.831 --> 00:14:00.552]  Remember the Tulsa mass shooting?
[00:14:00.672 --> 00:14:01.392]  They buried that.
[00:14:04.193 --> 00:14:04.493]  Why?
[00:14:04.673 --> 00:14:06.054]  Because that's their people.
[00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:11.613]  They don't want you to know that their people are violent and radical and terroristic.
[00:14:15.456 --> 00:14:22.542]  And unfortunately, we have been warning that this is coming for a long time.
[00:14:24.043 --> 00:14:25.044]  I studied psychology.
[00:14:25.484 --> 00:14:29.227]  It was actually something that was very interesting to me in college.
[00:14:29.827 --> 00:14:30.528]  I really enjoyed it.
[00:14:30.608 --> 00:14:33.690]  And I can tell you, I know the psychology of the left.
[00:14:34.571 --> 00:14:35.472]  It's dangerous, folks.
[00:14:36.482 --> 00:14:58.112]  And I've been warning, I've been warning for months, if not years, the radical leftists that share the roads with us and share restaurants and banks and everything else, share this country with us, they are just one little shove away from going off the deep end and going completely mental and completely psychotic.
[00:14:59.175 --> 00:15:07.080]  And what we saw yesterday with the attempted assassination of Brett Kavanaugh is just one example of many and many to come.
[00:15:10.962 --> 00:15:15.745]  And then here's some of the rhetoric from the Democrats, like Biden last night with Jimmy Kimmel.
[00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:21.489]  Biden predicts mini-revolution in November if SCOTUS overturns Roe vs. Wade.
[00:15:21.729 --> 00:15:22.770]  Oh, is that insurrection?
[00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:25.871]  Oh no, Democrats are allowed to say whatever they want.
[00:15:26.412 --> 00:15:27.973]  Only Trump supporters need to shut their mouths.
[00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:33.876]  Paul, nearly half of younger Democrat men think assassinating a politician is okay.
[00:15:33.936 --> 00:15:35.158]  Boy, where would they get that idea?
[00:15:36.784 --> 00:15:38.105]  Where would they get that idea?
[00:15:38.805 --> 00:15:51.935]  Oh, I don't know, Johnny Depp insinuating they assassinate Trump, and the New York theater depicting the assassination of Trump night after night after night, and Kathy Griffin holding up the decapitated Trump head.
[00:15:52.655 --> 00:15:59.400]  Where would they, where would the radical terroristic left get this idea that it's okay to assassinate their political opposition?
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.721]  Hmm, I just, I can't figure it out, I guess.
[00:16:02.902 --> 00:16:12.276]  And then, as the Democrats are sending their terrorists to the Supreme Court Justice's house, they're also blocking bills providing additional security for Supreme Court Justices.
[00:16:12.336 --> 00:16:12.576]  Yes.
[00:16:13.337 --> 00:16:14.059]  Not even kidding you.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.866]  Democrats send a terrorist to Brett Kavanaugh's house to kill him.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:36.293]  Republicans proposed legislation that we send extra security to Supreme Court Justices' House because an assassin just went to one of them and Democrats say, uh-uh, and they block that bill and then they send a hundred more radical leftists out to Supreme Court Justices' House.
[00:16:38.234 --> 00:16:39.675]  What more do you need to know about these people?
[00:16:40.076 --> 00:16:41.697]  How much further must they go?
[00:16:41.937 --> 00:16:43.118]  How many more must die?
[00:16:44.599 --> 00:16:49.043]  Biden predicts many revolution in November if SCOTUS overturns Roe vs. Wade.
[00:16:50.859 --> 00:16:52.781]  And what would that mini-revolution look like?
[00:16:52.821 --> 00:16:56.443]  Democrat terrorists assassinating Supreme Court justices like they tried yesterday?
[00:16:57.984 --> 00:16:58.325]  Poll!
[00:16:58.365 --> 00:17:02.748]  Nearly half of young Democrat men think assassination is okay.
[00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:08.432]  This is not your father's Democrat Party.
[00:17:09.533 --> 00:17:11.174]  This is Obama's Democrat Party.
[00:17:11.755 --> 00:17:18.320]  Radical, raging, communist, anti-American revolutionaries that want to burn this country to the ground.
[00:17:21.345 --> 00:17:24.767]  Democrats block bill providing additional security for Supreme Court justices.
[00:17:25.007 --> 00:17:26.508]  Imagine how evil the Democrats are.
[00:17:27.568 --> 00:17:29.229]  They lie about the Supreme Court justices.
[00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:32.811]  They then publish and promote their private addresses.
[00:17:33.232 --> 00:17:38.294]  They then send their protesters, violent protesters, to their private addresses.
[00:17:38.755 --> 00:17:48.160]  One attempts to kill a Supreme Court justice, and then they block the bill to have extra security there, and they also want to disarm civilians.
[00:17:49.079 --> 00:17:52.401]  Yeah, they want to be able to come kill whoever they want at their house whenever they want to.
[00:17:52.781 --> 00:17:53.722]  That's what it's all about.
[00:17:55.703 --> 00:17:59.566]  Why do you think they want to disarm civilians and disarm police?
[00:18:00.406 --> 00:18:06.090]  So that when they want to kill their political opposition they can do it with no resistance whatsoever.
[00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:09.492]  Which, yes, your assumption is correct there.
[00:18:11.473 --> 00:18:13.314]  They do want to kill their political opposition.
[00:18:15.836 --> 00:18:19.431]   And so, We've got all kinds of clips here.
[00:18:20.951 --> 00:18:23.412]  In fact, we have the Chuck Schumer clip.
[00:18:23.432 --> 00:18:26.113]  I don't know if it's on my list today, but we should probably play that one again, too.
[00:18:27.094 --> 00:18:28.934]  But here's Nancy Pelosi.
[00:18:28.954 --> 00:18:29.835]  This is only a month ago.
[00:18:30.015 --> 00:18:31.515]  This was only a month ago.
[00:18:32.156 --> 00:18:40.059]  Here is Nancy Pelosi on MSNBC encouraging people to influence the Supreme Court.
[00:18:40.719 --> 00:18:41.219]  Clip two.
[00:18:41.819 --> 00:18:44.740]  I think a right now crisis for a lot of women in this country.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.841]  What do we do for them right now?
[00:18:46.966 --> 00:18:49.428]  Yes, I think you're absolutely right.
[00:18:50.249 --> 00:19:00.157]  We have to have clarity in what this draft decision means so that the final decision doesn't go that far.
[00:19:00.637 --> 00:19:03.980]  The Chief Justice has said this is authentic.
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:05.801]  But it is not final.
[00:19:05.981 --> 00:19:07.221]  I don't want to use the word authentic.
[00:19:07.321 --> 00:19:08.722]  It's real, but not final.
[00:19:09.162 --> 00:19:13.485]  So, again, Lincoln said public sentiment is everything.
[00:19:13.525 --> 00:19:15.346]  With it, you can accomplish almost anything.
[00:19:15.386 --> 00:19:16.186]  Without it, nothing.
[00:19:16.566 --> 00:19:18.407]  And women just have to weigh in.
[00:19:18.927 --> 00:19:26.972]  I don't think there's a good outcome here, but I think there's a better outcome than what we have seen in the first draft, which is radical.
[00:19:31.024 --> 00:19:33.766]  And then, I don't know where it is in my stack here.
[00:19:34.046 --> 00:19:35.447]  You've got Lori Lightfoot.
[00:19:37.768 --> 00:19:38.769]  Guys, I sent you the tweet.
[00:19:38.809 --> 00:19:45.773]  I can't find it in my stack, but Lori Lightfoot literally said, it's time for a call to arms.
[00:19:46.834 --> 00:19:50.236]  A call to arms over Roe vs Wade.
[00:19:53.678 --> 00:19:54.959]  A call to arms.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:56.640]  Now look.
[00:19:59.008 --> 00:20:14.219]  Do I believe that Nancy Pelosi or Joe Biden or Lori Lightfoot can be held criminally responsible for a deranged lunatic who obviously took their advice and went to try to kill Brett Kavanaugh?
[00:20:14.919 --> 00:20:15.119]  No!
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:24.056]   No, I believe that they have a right to free speech, but you see, if If they're gonna say that Donald Trump Sr.
[00:20:24.156 --> 00:20:25.216]  and Donald Trump Jr.
[00:20:25.296 --> 00:20:35.298]  and Alex Jones calling for peace on January 6th is violence, then Democrats calling for violence and then violence happening is certainly terroristic.
[00:20:38.999 --> 00:20:41.159]  But let's not forget Chuck Schumer.
[00:20:41.399 --> 00:20:44.600]  Let's not forget old Chuckie Schumer and his threats to Kavanaugh as well.
[00:20:48.123 --> 00:20:57.871]  I want to tell you, Gorsuch, I want to tell you, Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price!
[00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:06.538]  You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.
[00:21:07.178 --> 00:21:08.359]  Yeah, you won't know what hit you.
[00:21:08.379 --> 00:21:10.501]  It'll be a Democrat pulling the trigger and a bullet.
[00:21:11.202 --> 00:21:11.942]  That's what'll hit you.
[00:21:13.964 --> 00:21:14.764]  Man, oh man.
[00:21:15.505 --> 00:21:16.085]  Man, oh man.
[00:21:17.981 --> 00:21:23.445]  We had the clip of Ron DeSantis earlier starting to understand is, hey, we don't care what you say about us anymore.
[00:21:23.485 --> 00:21:25.186]  You can print hit pieces on me all day long.
[00:21:25.206 --> 00:21:25.646]  I don't care.
[00:21:26.087 --> 00:21:26.887]  Here's Lori Lightfoot.
[00:21:27.408 --> 00:21:32.151]  To my friends in the LGBTQ plus community, the Supreme Court is coming for us next.
[00:21:32.271 --> 00:21:34.693]  This moment has to be a call to arms.
[00:21:35.474 --> 00:21:36.134]  Call to arms?
[00:21:36.214 --> 00:21:36.414]  What?
[00:21:36.434 --> 00:21:38.135]  I thought you wanted to disarm us.
[00:21:38.936 --> 00:21:45.681]  Do you think the guy that tried to assassinate Brett Kavanaugh, do you think he read that Lori Lightfoot tweet?
[00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:51.193]  Do you think he took that to heart and went out and tried to commit a political assassination because of Lori Lightfoot's tweet?
[00:21:52.474 --> 00:21:52.815]  Hmm.
[00:21:53.895 --> 00:21:54.155]  Hmm.
[00:21:54.676 --> 00:21:55.997]  Will there be an investigation?
[00:21:56.037 --> 00:21:56.938]  Will there be hearings?
[00:21:57.538 --> 00:22:00.940]  Will there be end-to-end, wire-to-wire news coverage?
[00:22:01.201 --> 00:22:01.921]  Of course not.
[00:22:02.361 --> 00:22:03.182]  It's a Democrat!
[00:22:05.524 --> 00:22:07.605]  But see, it's not just understanding.
[00:22:08.646 --> 00:22:13.730]  It's time to quit caring what these crooks, criminals, liars, deceivers think about us.
[00:22:15.666 --> 00:22:33.999]  It's also time to have the understanding, and this is not a new phenomenon, folks, this has been the case for a long, long time, to have the understanding that the biggest domestic terror group in this country, and the biggest hate group in this country, and probably our country's history, is the Democrat Party.
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.261]  Is the Democrat Party.
[00:22:38.274 --> 00:22:45.777]  From the weather underground to 60 million aborted babies, there is no more violent, deadly group than the Democrat Party.
[00:22:46.217 --> 00:23:07.465]  And now, because of a tragedy that happened, where kids died, very sad, which looks more than anything to be a police stand-down, I don't know how else you would describe it at this point, investigations are ongoing, not that I trust the investigations, but a police stand-down, good guy with a gun has to go in, if... I mean, think about the irony of that.
[00:23:08.755 --> 00:23:17.762]  Democrats are calling to take your firearms after the tragedy in Uvalde, but if it wasn't for citizens having a gun, there could have been 30 dead, 40 dead.
[00:23:18.502 --> 00:23:24.867]  If it wasn't for a citizen having a gun, there would have been more bloodshed in Uvalde.
[00:23:26.788 --> 00:23:35.735]  Now that's because of the police stand down, the police didn't go in the building, the police didn't stop the shooting, so a good guy, a citizen, with a gun, had to go in and do it himself, that he got from a barber shop.
[00:23:36.255 --> 00:23:36.896]  Happened to have one.
[00:23:39.298 --> 00:23:44.722]  So they use this tragedy for their political agenda to disarm the American people.
[00:23:45.002 --> 00:23:46.523]  They don't care about the Second Amendment.
[00:23:46.543 --> 00:23:48.425]  They'll get rid of the Second Amendment if they can.
[00:23:50.186 --> 00:23:55.710]  The Democrats will get rid of all the systems, the checks and balances, the rights.
[00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:58.852]  They will get rid of all those systems in this country if they have their way.
[00:23:59.833 --> 00:24:00.854]  They'll stack the court.
[00:24:01.174 --> 00:24:02.555]  They'll cancel elections.
[00:24:04.275 --> 00:24:07.856]  They've already told you, Biden has already said, the Bill of Rights is not absolute.
[00:24:07.977 --> 00:24:10.037]  Joe Biden told you the Bill of Rights is not absolute.
[00:24:10.137 --> 00:24:10.778]  That's treason.
[00:24:12.058 --> 00:24:16.080]  But yet, where is the Republican Party?
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.761]  Have you heard anything from Mitch McConnell?
[00:24:18.861 --> 00:24:19.081]  No.
[00:24:20.242 --> 00:24:25.064]  Have articles of impeachment been filed against Joe Biden for, you could have a hundred different reasons?
[00:24:25.524 --> 00:24:25.684]  No.
[00:24:26.946 --> 00:24:34.031]  Are Republicans doing big made-for-TV events or big hearings or big shows or anything in front of the Capitol or the Supreme Court or anything?
[00:24:34.291 --> 00:24:34.491]  No.
[00:24:35.692 --> 00:24:35.872]  No.
[00:24:37.113 --> 00:24:38.994]  You've got the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis.
[00:24:39.014 --> 00:24:40.415]  You've got Marjorie Taylor Greene.
[00:24:41.195 --> 00:24:42.156]  You've got Lauren Boeber.
[00:24:42.176 --> 00:24:42.977]  You've got Matt Gaetz.
[00:24:42.997 --> 00:24:44.077]  You've got Paul Gosar.
[00:24:44.097 --> 00:24:46.419]  You've got Rand Paul.
[00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:48.680]  That's pretty much it.
[00:24:51.222 --> 00:24:52.003]  That's pretty much it.
[00:24:52.863 --> 00:24:53.864]  It's pretty pathetic, isn't it?
[00:24:56.365 --> 00:25:12.956]  And yet here we are again, another turn of the calendar, and the fact will remain, the biggest domestic terror group in this country, and the biggest hate group in this country, and the biggest threat to this country, is the Democrat Party.
[00:25:14.677 --> 00:25:21.016]   So Joe Biden, Can't figure out how to help America, but he spent some time with Jimmy Kimmel last night.
[00:25:21.596 --> 00:25:25.557]  By the way, when he was boarding his plane, they shot it in the afternoon.
[00:25:26.278 --> 00:25:28.539]  So yeah, people saying, how was Biden able to stay up?
[00:25:28.619 --> 00:25:29.759]  Folks, they shot it in the afternoon.
[00:25:29.779 --> 00:25:30.459]  It was pre-taped.
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:36.322]  And when Biden was boarding his plane to go on the Jimmy Kimmel Show, he tripped and fell again.
[00:25:36.342 --> 00:25:36.862]  Remember that?
[00:25:37.799 --> 00:25:42.463]  Now, I wasn't going to make a big deal out of that, because it wasn't as bad as the time he fell four or five times or whatever.
[00:25:43.163 --> 00:25:45.806]  He took a little spill, but it wasn't that big of a deal.
[00:25:45.826 --> 00:25:46.766]  But he can barely walk.
[00:25:46.826 --> 00:25:50.309]  He's got Parkinson's, probably, and dementia, and all kinds of other things.
[00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:55.574]  But no, he went on Kimmel, and it's really just sick stuff, isn't it?
[00:25:55.774 --> 00:25:56.935]  It's really just sick stuff.
[00:25:56.955 --> 00:25:58.756]  But hey, Jimmy Kimmel is a voice mouth.
[00:25:58.816 --> 00:26:00.097]  He's a voice box.
[00:26:00.598 --> 00:26:02.139]  He's the mouthpiece for the Democrat Party.
[00:26:02.179 --> 00:26:02.960]  That's his job.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.081]  That's how he got the job.
[00:26:04.501 --> 00:26:21.646]   He agreed to be the Spokesperson unofficially for the Democrat Party hosting a late-night show so yeah They're gonna give him the president of the United States as a big guest and a little scratch scratch our backs together And so here's some of those clips Joe Biden thinks it's funny, or maybe he don't even know what's going on.
[00:26:22.266 --> 00:26:30.928]  He makes a joke about throwing his political opponents in jail Yeah, that's real funny isn't it as you actually do have political prisoners Joe here.
[00:26:30.948 --> 00:26:34.997]   It is clip 17 Look, the Republicans don't play it square.
[00:26:35.057 --> 00:26:36.058]  Why do you play it square?
[00:26:36.118 --> 00:26:36.898]  Oh my God.
[00:26:37.098 --> 00:26:37.799]  Well, guess what?
[00:26:38.239 --> 00:26:41.461]  If we do the same thing they do, our democracy will literally be in jeopardy.
[00:26:42.241 --> 00:26:45.163]  Not a joke.
[00:26:45.403 --> 00:26:57.491]  I understand that argument, but also it's like you're playing Monopoly with somebody who, you know, won't pass go and won't follow any of the rules, and how do you ever make any progress if they're not following the rules?
[00:26:57.511 --> 00:27:00.472]  We've got to send them to jail, you know.
[00:27:00.512 --> 00:27:02.153]  Directly to jail?
[00:27:05.492 --> 00:27:07.153]  Oh, Republicans don't play by the rules.
[00:27:07.193 --> 00:27:07.473]  Really?
[00:27:07.913 --> 00:27:13.754]  We just caught another Democrat stuffing the ballot box in Pennsylvania.
[00:27:14.874 --> 00:27:23.836]  So Democrats have been caught in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Michigan, stuffing ballot boxes, cheating in elections.
[00:27:24.956 --> 00:27:26.436]  Oh, Republicans don't play it fair.
[00:27:26.736 --> 00:27:26.956]  Really?
[00:27:26.976 --> 00:27:28.916]  Who's censoring the opposition on social media?
[00:27:30.057 --> 00:27:31.517]  Oh, Republicans don't play it fair.
[00:27:32.642 --> 00:27:35.204]  Did Hunter Biden go to jail when he broke gun laws?
[00:27:36.505 --> 00:27:36.726]  No.
[00:27:37.827 --> 00:27:40.629]  I mean, just unbelievable lies coming from Joe Biden.
[00:27:40.649 --> 00:27:44.993]  And they just sit there, they just clap, and they laugh it off as they're trying to conquer and destroy this country.
[00:27:46.815 --> 00:27:47.916]  How does that make you feel?
[00:27:47.956 --> 00:27:48.676]  Here's Biden.
[00:27:49.077 --> 00:27:51.018]  This is another hilarious one, folks.
[00:27:51.479 --> 00:27:52.339]  It's only white people.
[00:27:52.379 --> 00:27:54.381]  You only see white people on TV ads.
[00:27:54.441 --> 00:27:54.962]  You know that.
[00:27:58.927 --> 00:28:00.107]  No, I'm serious.
[00:28:00.167 --> 00:28:01.488]  There's something to that, yeah.
[00:28:01.528 --> 00:28:02.068]  No, I'm serious.
[00:28:02.108 --> 00:28:03.969]  You turn on the TV, look at the ads.
[00:28:03.989 --> 00:28:07.129]  When's the last time you saw biracial couples on TV?
[00:28:07.149 --> 00:28:12.811]  When's the last time you saw the way, I mean, people are selling products, they do ads to sell products.
[00:28:13.211 --> 00:28:15.532]  And they sell products when people, they appeal to people.
[00:28:15.872 --> 00:28:18.212]  This generation is gonna change everything.
[00:28:18.252 --> 00:28:21.013]  We just got to make sure we don't give up.
[00:28:21.453 --> 00:28:28.056]   There's an ability for us to do everything from Increase the access to education, healthcare.
[00:28:28.096 --> 00:28:29.156]  Look what we did in healthcare!
[00:28:29.796 --> 00:28:31.837]  Yeah, what did you do in healthcare?
[00:28:31.857 --> 00:28:32.778]  It was a complete disaster.
[00:28:32.818 --> 00:28:36.739]  But see, he accidentally just told you the agenda.
[00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.480]  They're targeting children with all their propaganda.
[00:28:40.281 --> 00:28:42.302]  They're targeting children with their gun propaganda.
[00:28:42.322 --> 00:28:44.363]  They're targeting children with their sex propaganda.
[00:28:44.683 --> 00:28:46.964]  Because that's what Hitler did.
[00:28:48.595 --> 00:28:51.698]  Hitler said, give me the youth of the nation, I'll rule that nation in seven years.
[00:28:51.738 --> 00:28:54.742]  That's the Democrats, that's Joe Biden taking Hitler's advice.
[00:28:55.823 --> 00:29:01.689]  So that's why they target the children with gun control, that's why they target the children to make them gay and everything else, make them sexual deviants.
[00:29:03.231 --> 00:29:05.013]  Because they want them to inherit the world.
[00:29:06.713 --> 00:29:20.495]  So that America will be no more and they can have the one world totalitarian authoritarian government that is the pipe dream of authoritarians and sycophants throughout world history.
[00:29:22.676 --> 00:29:27.617]  But oh yeah, that's the joke is how you only see white people on TV now.
[00:29:28.097 --> 00:29:31.377]  Actually, the joke is how you only see black people on TV now.
[00:29:33.238 --> 00:29:45.904]   And the truth is, It's really not even something that is really a big deal, I don't think, other than it's just a cultural phenomenon we're witnessing.
[00:29:46.584 --> 00:29:49.807]  But no, all the corporations want corporate blackface now.
[00:29:49.987 --> 00:29:55.391]  That's what they do, is they hire a black person to represent their brand because it's all about corporate blackface now.
[00:29:57.093 --> 00:29:59.134]  But Biden tells you all you see on TV is white people.
[00:30:00.516 --> 00:30:02.697]  Says the white president who's been in office for, what, 700 years now?
[00:30:04.875 --> 00:30:09.877]  I mean, Biden might have witnessed the first transaction of slaves, you know, coming from Africa here.
[00:30:11.258 --> 00:30:12.298]  Biden probably was a part of that.
[00:30:12.318 --> 00:30:13.219]  He may have purchased a couple.
[00:30:14.099 --> 00:30:15.080]  And now listen to this.
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.481]  Biden claims that we have the best economy in the world.
[00:30:18.541 --> 00:30:19.061]  Listen to this.
[00:30:20.242 --> 00:30:20.762]  Here's where we are.
[00:30:21.583 --> 00:30:24.244]  We have the fastest growing economy in the world.
[00:30:24.744 --> 00:30:25.424]  The world.
[00:30:25.944 --> 00:30:26.605]  The world.
[00:30:28.246 --> 00:30:29.086]  Sorry, one more time, Joe?
[00:30:33.338 --> 00:30:35.701]  Here's where we are.
[00:30:36.502 --> 00:30:39.164]  We have the fastest-growing economy in the world.
[00:30:39.685 --> 00:30:40.325]  The world.
[00:30:40.866 --> 00:30:41.527]  The world.
[00:30:41.867 --> 00:30:42.407]  Here's where we are.
[00:30:43.228 --> 00:30:45.811]  We have the fastest-growing economy in the world.
[00:30:45.931 --> 00:30:46.211]  Really?
[00:30:46.231 --> 00:30:46.492]  The world.
[00:30:46.512 --> 00:30:47.052]  The world.
[00:30:47.473 --> 00:30:51.256]  We have the fastest-growing economy in the world, according to Joe Biden.
[00:30:52.277 --> 00:30:52.638]  Wow.
[00:30:52.798 --> 00:30:58.517]  I said, "Hmm, fastest growing economy in the world, where?
[00:30:58.517 --> 00:31:00.557]  What planet does he live on?
[00:31:00.557 --> 00:31:04.798]   What metrics, what data, what proof, what evidence does he have of that?
[00:31:04.798 --> 00:31:05.798]  Americans are suffering actually."
[00:31:05.798 --> 00:31:10.997]   I've got a whole stack of news on how Americans are suffering and the economy is suffering,
[00:31:10.997 --> 00:31:15.557]   but then Joe Biden just says, "Best economy in the world, best economic recovery in history,
[00:31:15.557 --> 00:31:16.557]  Jack."
[00:31:16.557 --> 00:31:22.117]  What an unmitigated, unfazed liar Joe Biden is.
[00:31:22.117 --> 00:31:24.438]  And Jimmy Kimmel just sits right up there and takes it.
[00:31:24.438 --> 00:31:30.798]   And then here's one more from Joe Biden on Jimmy Kimmel last night on clip 28.
[00:31:30.791 --> 00:31:49.220]  If this makes sense is why it doesn't make sense and why it seems so crazy and that we have so many problems and that maybe it's just that Americans aren't as knowledgeable as they should be or maybe there's a death star pumping false information into our brains.
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:49.740]  Fox, that's CNN.
[00:31:51.901 --> 00:31:53.583]  Or maybe it's always been this way.
[00:31:53.603 --> 00:31:59.407]  I mean, here in LA, what, like, like, you know, a small fraction of people voted in the primary yesterday.
[00:31:59.587 --> 00:32:01.629]  And then everybody wants to complain about everything.
[00:32:01.709 --> 00:32:03.851]  And it's just, it's enough already.
[00:32:04.231 --> 00:32:07.534]  And I think you need to start yelling at people, is really what I think.
[00:32:07.554 --> 00:32:08.535]  Well, here's what I think.
[00:32:08.595 --> 00:32:08.855]  Look.
[00:32:09.015 --> 00:32:09.876]  Or maybe shooting them.
[00:32:09.956 --> 00:32:10.897]  After all, we're Democrats.
[00:32:10.917 --> 00:32:13.619]  The impact the pandemic has had on people.
[00:32:14.429 --> 00:32:16.570]  It has had enormous impact.
[00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:17.550]  Negative impact.
[00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:18.170]  Fake pandemic.
[00:32:18.251 --> 00:32:20.111]  Think of just your kids.
[00:32:20.611 --> 00:32:21.712]  How many of them got to go to a prom?
[00:32:21.812 --> 00:32:23.553]  How many of them had a graduation?
[00:32:23.573 --> 00:32:24.073]  Because of you.
[00:32:24.413 --> 00:32:25.613]  Because of Democrats.
[00:32:26.354 --> 00:32:31.316]  How much has changed in terms of the relationships between people and how they interact with one another?
[00:32:32.156 --> 00:32:34.697]  So much has changed.
[00:32:34.717 --> 00:32:40.579]  Vivek Murthy, the Surgeon General, talks about the need for significant mental health proposals.
[00:32:41.099 --> 00:32:42.580]  Yeah, liberalism is a mental disorder.
[00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:42.940]  I agree.
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:57.906]  Feeling not knowing where they're going not knowing how how to respond not knowing how to act Just stunning stuff in it just incredible stuff there I Just I don't even know how to respond it.
[00:32:57.926 --> 00:33:06.169]  You know it's just everything they say is a lie I Mean Jimmy Did it feel good to sell your soul to the Democrats?
[00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:08.210]  How much are they paying you man?
[00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:09.631]  Is it worth it was your soul worth it?
[00:33:09.671 --> 00:33:09.691]  I?
[00:33:10.902 --> 00:33:13.224]  To become the mouthpiece for these scumbag liars.
[00:33:13.284 --> 00:33:17.288]  But see, Joe Biden says, oh, look at how much we suffered in COVID, the fake pandemic.
[00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:22.072]  Folks, forget about that.
[00:33:22.513 --> 00:33:23.734]  They want to end America.
[00:33:25.575 --> 00:33:27.017]  Forget about everything that was lost during COVID.
[00:33:27.037 --> 00:33:28.038]  They're going to end America.
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:31.641]  The Biden boom.
[00:33:33.763 --> 00:33:35.985]  Oh, oh my gosh.
[00:33:37.318 --> 00:33:41.901]  But you know, Joe Biden and Jimmy Kimmel going on national TV telling you it's the greatest economy ever.
[00:33:42.222 --> 00:33:47.926]  How do you think Americans are going to feel about that, who can't even afford to fill their tank, can't even afford to put food on the table?
[00:33:47.946 --> 00:33:49.847]  How do you think they're going to feel about that?
[00:33:51.308 --> 00:34:01.816]  So, it's not a good thing, but keep lying Democrats, keep doing what you do, and you're just going to become more and more unpopular, and you'll have to steal the midterms more than you even stole the presidential election.
[00:34:03.191 --> 00:34:11.659]  So, but look, folks, we know that there are serious food shortages coming or serious price increases coming with the inflation.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.182]  That's why we launched our new site.
[00:34:17.725 --> 00:34:18.505]  Where did it go here?
[00:34:19.904 --> 00:34:21.725]  Preparetoday.com.

[00:34:43.759 --> 00:34:44.680]  Preparetoday.com.
[00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:47.791]  The Democrats are collapsing America.

[00:34:58.671 --> 00:35:07.011]   And isn't it amazing how with the Uvalde shooting, it's the gun's fault, but in the Kenosha situation
[00:35:07.011 --> 00:35:10.991]   where Kyle Rittenhouse defended his life against violent criminals, it was his fault.
[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:13.201]  Isn't that amazing?
[00:35:13.281 --> 00:35:14.062]  Liberal logic.
[00:35:14.262 --> 00:35:14.943]  It's not logic.
[00:35:15.003 --> 00:35:15.803]  It's propaganda.
[00:35:16.544 --> 00:35:17.044]  How do you know?
[00:35:17.104 --> 00:35:18.746]  Because it can't be applied universally.
[00:35:19.346 --> 00:35:22.309]  It's the easiest test to find out whether it's logic or propaganda.
[00:35:22.389 --> 00:35:24.030]  Can it be applied universally?
[00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:25.612]  If not, it's propaganda.
[00:35:25.952 --> 00:35:26.933]  It's liberalism.
[00:35:28.094 --> 00:35:33.959]  Here are some of the laws that passed in the House last night.
[00:35:33.999 --> 00:35:38.983]  They've got an uphill battle in the Senate, but if they get even one of these passed, it'll be bad for America.
[00:35:41.007 --> 00:35:41.227]  U.S.
[00:35:41.247 --> 00:35:50.174]  House of Representatives votes to criminalize disassembling, cleaning, and reassembling your gun without a firearm manufacturer's license.
[00:35:51.415 --> 00:35:51.655]  What?
[00:35:53.396 --> 00:35:53.616]  What?
[00:35:54.397 --> 00:35:55.438]  That is insanity.
[00:35:55.978 --> 00:35:57.219]  You can't clean your gun?
[00:35:57.259 --> 00:36:00.381]  You can't take apart and reassemble your gun unless you have a license?
[00:36:01.002 --> 00:36:01.282]  What?
[00:36:03.804 --> 00:36:08.247]  That doesn't even make any sense, not to mention it's dangerous not to clean your firearm.
[00:36:09.735 --> 00:36:10.895]  Passed in the house.
[00:36:11.716 --> 00:36:12.536]  Makes no sense at all.
[00:36:13.216 --> 00:36:21.599]  They also passed bills that said you have to have some sort of a storage for your firearm.
[00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.041]  Your magazine cannot be in your firearm.
[00:36:25.461 --> 00:36:37.165]  So remember, they passed laws, like for example, how if you're in your vehicle, some states you cannot have a loaded gun and you cannot even have the gun next to the ammo.
[00:36:37.225 --> 00:36:38.806]  It has to be completely separately stored.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:43.643]  Oh okay, so criminal comes to rob your car, rob you at gunpoint.
[00:36:44.624 --> 00:36:55.151]  You're gonna say, excuse me sir, I have a gun legally stashed in my glove compartment, locked away as the law says, and my magazine with my ammo is in the back of my trunk.
[00:36:55.491 --> 00:37:04.257]  Would you mind just holding right there while I unlock my glove compartment and then go into my trunk and load my weapon so that I can defend myself against you right now?
[00:37:04.297 --> 00:37:04.838]  Would you mind that?
[00:37:05.697 --> 00:37:07.719]  That's insanity, but that's the law.
[00:37:07.919 --> 00:37:09.520]  That's what we're doing right now.
[00:37:09.821 --> 00:37:11.522]  Now they're doing the same thing in your house.
[00:37:12.903 --> 00:37:13.964]  Or at least that's what they want to do.
[00:37:14.685 --> 00:37:19.890]  Oh, a criminal comes into your house with a gun to murder you or rape your wife or steal your stuff, torture your kids.
[00:37:21.308 --> 00:37:26.930]  He's got a gun and you say, oh sir, sir, I noticed you have a gun and you're about to rape my wife and kill my kids.
[00:37:27.811 --> 00:37:32.013]  I have my legally stashed gun in a safe over there.
[00:37:32.073 --> 00:37:35.134]  Do you mind if I go get my gun out of its safe?
[00:37:35.214 --> 00:37:40.596]  And I'm not allowed to keep my magazine in the gun anymore either or keep the gun loaded.
[00:37:40.616 --> 00:37:43.858]  So I'm going to have to go to my other storage case to load it.
[00:37:44.298 --> 00:37:51.560]  Do you mind waiting here for five to ten minutes while I get my firearm ready to defend you, uh, defend me against you, and defend my family against you?
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.700]  That's how it'll work, right?
[00:37:55.941 --> 00:37:57.261]  Oh yes, this is what you're seeing on screen.
[00:37:57.281 --> 00:37:57.981]  That's illegal now.
[00:37:58.221 --> 00:37:59.341]  Don't, oh no no no!
[00:37:59.701 --> 00:38:01.262]  Don't think about cleaning your weapon.
[00:38:01.302 --> 00:38:02.182]  That's illegal now.
[00:38:03.122 --> 00:38:03.802]  It's insanity.
[00:38:03.822 --> 00:38:04.843]  It doesn't stop anything.
[00:38:04.883 --> 00:38:06.283]  It's not gonna stop a school shooting.
[00:38:06.323 --> 00:38:07.563]  It's not gonna stop a mass shooting.
[00:38:07.603 --> 00:38:08.643]  It's not gonna stop a crime.
[00:38:09.624 --> 00:38:10.444]  It's all pandering.
[00:38:10.484 --> 00:38:11.344]  It's all lunacy.
[00:38:12.932 --> 00:38:19.678]  It's all Democrats taking advantage of a tragedy nitpicking away at our Second Amendment rights.
[00:38:20.418 --> 00:38:21.759]  You want to stop school shootings?
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:22.980]  The answer is simple.
[00:38:23.521 --> 00:38:25.703]  Put well-trained armed guards at schools.
[00:38:26.083 --> 00:38:28.745]  We may not like that solution, but it's the only one that's going to work.
[00:38:29.426 --> 00:38:38.533]  Stopping people from having access to a firearm readily available in their house to defend themselves and their family has no impact on school shootings whatsoever.
[00:38:40.715 --> 00:38:41.236]  Oh, but see?
[00:38:43.015 --> 00:38:44.156]  We're doing something!
[00:38:45.377 --> 00:38:46.518]  We're doing something!
[00:38:47.299 --> 00:38:54.905]  They're also trying to ban any magazines that hold more than 15 rounds of ammunition, so that's like half of the firearms are now going to be illegal.
[00:38:59.529 --> 00:39:05.154]  All in response to a mass shooting that they say they just want to prevent another one, but yet they're not doing anything to prevent another one.
[00:39:06.235 --> 00:39:06.916]  Incredible, isn't it?
[00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:10.591]  Thomas Massey, one of the good ones.
[00:39:11.251 --> 00:39:12.912]  They said the quiet part out loud.
[00:39:13.113 --> 00:39:15.234]  They don't just want to ban assault weapons.
[00:39:15.374 --> 00:39:17.996]  They want to ban all semi-automatic rifles.
[00:39:18.396 --> 00:39:20.237]  This is the official House Democrats Twitter.
[00:39:21.458 --> 00:39:23.719]  It says, semi-automatic rifles are weapons of war.
[00:39:23.819 --> 00:39:28.242]  Refusing to act and save lives in this moment is an immoral abandonment of our constitutional duty.
[00:39:28.262 --> 00:39:29.343]  Oh my gosh.
[00:39:30.854 --> 00:39:31.595]  Oh my gosh.
[00:39:31.875 --> 00:39:33.557]  Democrats talking about morals?
[00:39:33.797 --> 00:39:35.318]  You kill millions of babies.
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:38.742]  Democrats talking about morals.
[00:39:39.803 --> 00:39:40.263]  Spare me.
[00:39:41.244 --> 00:39:41.965]  Spare me, please.
[00:39:42.445 --> 00:39:43.726]  And I got news for you.
[00:39:44.807 --> 00:39:49.492]  Yes, weapons of war actually is what the Second Amendment is about.
[00:39:50.192 --> 00:39:53.355]  Sorry, I know you don't like to hear that and you lie about it, but no, it is.
[00:39:53.916 --> 00:39:55.678]  So yes, Democrats, they just want to take it all.
[00:39:56.698 --> 00:40:00.939]  And they are trying to raise the age to purchase a firearm to 21.
[00:40:01.079 --> 00:40:01.660]  To 21.
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:09.002]  So you can vote when you're 18, you can go serve and die for your country when you're 18, but you can't have a Second Amendment right?
[00:40:09.702 --> 00:40:13.503]  And Democrats say it's their constitutional duty to remove the Second Amendment?
[00:40:14.023 --> 00:40:14.503]  Amazing.
[00:40:15.544 --> 00:40:15.984]  Amazing.
[00:40:16.424 --> 00:40:18.505]  The Democrat lunacy doesn't stop.
[00:40:18.845 --> 00:40:20.485]  This is from the Chicago Sun-Times.
[00:40:20.505 --> 00:40:21.986]  You've never seen something more ridiculous.
[00:40:22.526 --> 00:40:25.607]  Restrict guns for the same reason as child porn.
[00:40:27.009 --> 00:40:27.229]  What?
[00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:29.230]  What?
[00:40:30.151 --> 00:40:31.011]  Folks, that's a real story.
[00:40:31.571 --> 00:40:33.692]  Neil Steinberg, Chicago Sun-Times.
[00:40:34.392 --> 00:40:37.894]  Restrict guns for the same reason as child porn.
[00:40:39.875 --> 00:40:43.177]  You're comparing the Second Amendment and guns to child porn?
[00:40:43.757 --> 00:40:44.997]  You might be a pedophile.
[00:40:45.077 --> 00:40:46.078]  You might be a pervert.
[00:40:46.398 --> 00:40:50.460]  If you went and looked at his internet history, if you went and looked at his hard drive, you think you'd find anything?
[00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:51.921]  Hmm.
[00:40:53.024 --> 00:40:54.966]  Restrict guns for the same reason as child porn?
[00:40:55.046 --> 00:40:55.426]  Are you?
[00:40:55.766 --> 00:40:56.186]  Are you?
[00:40:56.527 --> 00:40:57.508]  You've lost your mind!
[00:40:58.548 --> 00:40:59.709]  Only a liberal.
[00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:01.391]  Only a liberal.
[00:41:01.711 --> 00:41:03.072]  But what about porn?
[00:41:03.492 --> 00:41:04.333]  What about child porn?
[00:41:04.733 --> 00:41:10.137]  Twitter refused to remove child porn because they say it didn't violate their policies, according to a lawsuit.
[00:41:10.738 --> 00:41:11.598]  Wow!
[00:41:12.899 --> 00:41:22.447]  Twitter refused to take down widely shared pornographic images and videos of teenage sex trafficking victims because an investigation didn't find a violation of Twitter's policies.
[00:41:23.854 --> 00:41:24.475]  That's nice.
[00:41:24.755 --> 00:41:25.455]  Isn't that sweet?
[00:41:26.396 --> 00:41:27.437]  Trump's not allowed on Twitter.
[00:41:27.477 --> 00:41:28.358]  I'm not allowed on Twitter.
[00:41:28.398 --> 00:41:29.439]  The truth isn't allowed on Twitter.
[00:41:29.679 --> 00:41:30.620]  But child porn?
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:31.861]  Good.
[00:41:32.281 --> 00:41:32.982]  Good for Twitter.
[00:41:34.943 --> 00:41:36.785]  Must be a Democrat Party platform.
[00:41:36.805 --> 00:41:40.408]  Who do you think lobbied Twitter to keep child porn up there?
[00:41:41.974 --> 00:41:43.796]  I don't know, maybe somebody should ask Joe Biden that.
[00:41:43.877 --> 00:41:46.200]  How does gun control work exactly in Nigeria, though?
[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:48.382]  Very strict gun control laws.
[00:41:49.164 --> 00:41:58.916]  Over 50 parishioners, including children, killed in vile and satanic mass shooting inside Catholic Church in Nigeria.
[00:41:59.901 --> 00:42:01.763]  At least 50 dead, including many children.
[00:42:02.524 --> 00:42:02.724]  St.
[00:42:02.764 --> 00:42:05.406]  Francis Catholic Church in Nigeria.
[00:42:05.707 --> 00:42:06.828]  Very strict gun laws.
[00:42:07.648 --> 00:42:10.071]  Some of the strictest you can have.
[00:42:10.831 --> 00:42:12.593]  And it did not stop this mass murder.
[00:42:12.673 --> 00:42:15.196]  Oh, but Democrats say it doesn't happen anywhere else.
[00:42:15.556 --> 00:42:16.717]  Oh, it never happens anywhere else.
[00:42:16.797 --> 00:42:17.117]  Oh, really?
[00:42:18.979 --> 00:42:24.625]  I believe there's like seven or eight countries that have more gun crimes than America, so they just lie about that.
[00:42:25.677 --> 00:42:30.560]  House Democrats propose 1,000% tax increase on quote-unquote assault weapons.
[00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:32.942]  Again, there is no... What is an assault weapon?
[00:42:33.102 --> 00:42:35.263]  I mean, brass knuckles could be an assault weapon.
[00:42:35.804 --> 00:42:36.584]  No, it's just guns.
[00:42:36.624 --> 00:42:38.025]  They want a 1,000% increase on guns.
[00:42:38.045 --> 00:42:38.886]  Well, that works for them.
[00:42:39.746 --> 00:42:45.030]  That way, all of them, and with all their money, can still have access to firearms, but you can't.
[00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:46.391]  You see, that's what it's all about.
[00:42:47.372 --> 00:42:50.833]  Matthew McConaughey wants to take your guns, but he has armed security.
[00:42:51.873 --> 00:42:55.114]  Nancy Pelosi wants to take your guns, but she has armed security.
[00:42:55.154 --> 00:42:58.035]  Joe Biden wants to take your guns, but he has armed security.
[00:42:58.515 --> 00:43:00.675]  How is it they never have to answer these questions?
[00:43:01.676 --> 00:43:08.718]  How is it they never have to, or are never challenged on this hypocrisy, never challenged on this double standard?
[00:43:09.638 --> 00:43:10.098]  Like, hey!
[00:43:12.287 --> 00:43:17.630]  You keep talking about how guns are the problem, but I notice you're followed around by armed security.
[00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:18.471]  Why is that?
[00:43:20.372 --> 00:43:21.713]  Well, of course, you know what they would say.
[00:43:21.733 --> 00:43:22.834]  Remember Lori Lightfoot?
[00:43:22.854 --> 00:43:23.954]  Well, I'm more important than you.
[00:43:25.115 --> 00:43:31.539]  I get to go out and get my hair done during a pandemic when I shut everyone else's business down because I'm more important than you.
[00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:35.161]  I can't wait till this actually comes up, because it's going to.
[00:43:35.481 --> 00:43:36.062]  It's inevitable.
[00:43:37.196 --> 00:43:39.357]  All these Democrats calling for gun control.
[00:43:39.958 --> 00:43:41.419]  Someone's going to finally ask them.
[00:43:41.459 --> 00:43:42.139]  It's going to happen.
[00:43:42.599 --> 00:43:47.702]  Hey, you keep calling for gun control followed around by armed security.
[00:43:48.463 --> 00:43:51.405]  Are you going to have your armed security turn its guns into?
[00:43:51.465 --> 00:43:52.225]  Well, of course not.
[00:43:52.265 --> 00:43:53.186]  I'm more important than you.
[00:43:53.726 --> 00:43:57.368]  Cannot wait for that to come out of a Democrat's mouth and you know it's going to happen.
[00:43:58.609 --> 00:44:00.830]  You know it's inevitable and you know that that's their response.
[00:44:01.731 --> 00:44:10.809]   And I can't wait till that day comes because Then, you can look at the Democrat voter and the Liberal and say, okay, do you believe that politicians are above you?
[00:44:12.591 --> 00:44:14.053]  And then they'll probably say yes.
[00:44:14.713 --> 00:44:19.338]  And then they will probably go ahead and just say yes and admit that they're slaves at that point.
[00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:25.826]  Pregnant woman used AR-15 to drop armed robber attacking her 11-year-old daughter.
[00:44:27.247 --> 00:44:29.449]  Boba, you don't need an AR-15, you don't need a gun.
[00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:47.383]  And it's too bad that Democrats didn't have their laws in place because if Mrs. King had her rifle stored in a safe and separated from her magazine, it probably would have taken about five minutes for her to assemble all that to defend her daughter.
[00:44:47.903 --> 00:44:53.488]  But luckily, those insane laws were not in place in Florida and she was able to save her daughter's life and her own life.
[00:44:55.401 --> 00:45:00.686]  But probably would have had an 11-year-old dead or raped if Democrat laws went into place.
[00:45:01.087 --> 00:45:04.971]  Naperville cop fatally shoots hatchet-wielding man during traffic stop.
[00:45:06.112 --> 00:45:11.818]  Guy comes at him with a hatchet, tries to kill him, pulls his gun, and stops that wild man from killing him.
[00:45:13.139 --> 00:45:13.900]  But hey, you know what?
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:30.438]  We should probably just get rid of all the guns.
[00:45:30.709 --> 00:45:32.310]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[00:45:32.791 --> 00:45:36.213]  Well, it's actually a very sick feeling because I knew this was coming.
[00:45:36.694 --> 00:45:37.655]  I tried to stop it.
[00:45:38.195 --> 00:45:48.183]  And now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever because the globalists aren't hiding anymore in policy reports and documents.
[00:45:48.383 --> 00:45:50.044]  It's now out in the open.
[00:45:50.084 --> 00:45:53.386]  Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth.
[00:45:54.147 --> 00:45:55.968]  The Bilderberg Group founded DevoScript.
[00:45:56.608 --> 00:45:59.149]  So now, the fight's out in the open.
[00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:02.631]  They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[00:46:02.771 --> 00:46:03.672]  We're going to win this thing.
[00:46:03.732 --> 00:46:04.472]  God's watching.
[00:46:04.492 --> 00:46:05.633]  The children are counting on us.
[00:46:05.653 --> 00:46:12.916]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support because without you, InfoWars would not be here.
[00:46:13.136 --> 00:46:16.258]  So I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the InfoWar.
[00:46:16.858 --> 00:46:19.261]  And you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[00:46:19.581 --> 00:46:24.707]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[00:46:25.007 --> 00:46:33.036]  You know, we need to make sure we really fully support the good members of Congress that we have, which is sadly very few.
[00:46:33.737 --> 00:46:56.352]   But we really need to get behind them and pray for them and Reassure them that we love them and we're praying for them and we support their work never give up Marjorie Taylor Greene is one of them and here she is calling out Lindsey Graham on his Democrats his Democrat leanings on gun control in clip 7
[00:46:57.279 --> 00:46:59.120]  So here's what I've been asking everyone to do.
[00:46:59.461 --> 00:47:06.726]  I'm asking everyone to call Senator Lindsey Graham's office, 202-224-5972.
[00:47:07.667 --> 00:47:15.573]  Call Senator Graham and tell him to stop helping Joe Biden, destroy your freedoms, take away your gun rights, and burn this country down.
[00:47:15.893 --> 00:47:25.821]  Tell Senator Lindsey Graham to be a Republican and to do his job in the Senate, that is hold the line, and vote no to Joe Biden's red flag gun confiscation bills.
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:28.663]  Guys, you heard it from the Congresswoman right there.
[00:47:28.883 --> 00:47:29.845]  She is fired up.
[00:47:30.005 --> 00:47:34.972]  I can tell you that she treats every single day when it comes to the Second Amendment like our last.
[00:47:35.493 --> 00:47:36.153]  She's fighting.
[00:47:36.474 --> 00:47:37.495]  She's pushing in the House.
[00:47:37.615 --> 00:47:39.818]  She has some great colleagues as well who are pushing as well.
[00:47:40.139 --> 00:47:41.501]  But that fight is over in the Senate.
[00:47:41.801 --> 00:47:43.522]  Make the call to Lindsey Graham's office.
[00:47:43.642 --> 00:47:45.243]  Make the call to your senator's offices.
[00:47:45.323 --> 00:47:46.984]  Go to StopRedFlags.com.
[00:47:47.344 --> 00:47:48.164]  Keep the heat on.
[00:47:48.424 --> 00:47:54.267]  Yes, there's big fights in the House this week, but also the big showdown battle is over in the Senate.
[00:47:54.587 --> 00:47:55.928]  Congresswoman, I know you've got a busy day.
[00:47:55.948 --> 00:48:01.971]  You're running all over town, fighting for our rights, really, and we appreciate you coming on, and just keep up the fight.
[00:48:01.851 --> 00:48:11.289]  Marjorie Taylor Green.
[00:48:11.102 --> 00:48:17.021]   out there and really talk to their representatives, their senators, and do the lobbying work themselves.
[00:48:17.021 --> 00:48:18.262]  I think they would enjoy it.
[00:48:18.262 --> 00:48:19.961]  Alright guys, you heard her.
[00:48:19.961 --> 00:48:22.982]  Take action, keep the pressure on, and let's win this fight.
[00:48:22.982 --> 00:48:23.982]  Thanks.
[00:48:23.982 --> 00:48:24.982]  Thank you.
[00:48:24.982 --> 00:48:28.182]   Marjorie Taylor Greene, what a just an absolute champion for freedom.
[00:48:28.182 --> 00:48:31.941]  God bless Marjorie Taylor Greene.
[00:48:32.666 --> 00:48:34.667]  Thank you, God, for Marjorie Taylor Greene.
[00:48:35.787 --> 00:48:38.008]  And thank you, God, for Chip Roy as well.
[00:48:38.068 --> 00:48:40.229]  Here's Chip Roy calling out Joe Biden in Clip 5.
[00:48:41.509 --> 00:48:42.209]  I thank the Speaker.
[00:48:42.689 --> 00:48:47.371]  I noticed my colleague from Texas was down here a little bit earlier talking about the tragedy in Uvalde.
[00:48:47.411 --> 00:48:54.813]  And I can tell you, as someone who represents Central Texas and a district and a county that shares a border with Uvalde County, it hits close to home.
[00:48:55.233 --> 00:49:00.595]  But I would note that the President of the United States and my colleagues have suddenly found Uvalde and South Texas on a map.
[00:49:01.235 --> 00:49:03.957]  We've got 15,000 people in a caravan coming to Texas.
[00:49:03.977 --> 00:49:07.080]  We have 700 and something people, migrants, who have died along the border.
[00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:12.485]  We have body morgues, mobile morgues, being used in South Texas along the Rio Grande.
[00:49:12.785 --> 00:49:19.030]  And now suddenly, to go exploit a tragedy for political purposes, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle can find Uvalde on a map.
[00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:24.235]  Because they sure as hell haven't been able to find Uvalde on a map over the last year and a half of this administration.
[00:49:24.835 --> 00:49:35.681]  We'll have more to talk this week about the politicization of this tragedy in Uvalde and targeting the pretext and the false use by my colleague from Texas of, quote, automatic weapons as opposed to semi-automatic weapons.
[00:49:35.982 --> 00:49:39.864]  But let's be clear, our borders remain wide open and Americans are dying in droves.
[00:49:40.204 --> 00:49:44.347]  Hundreds and thousands of people across this country who are dying because of open borders.
[00:49:44.607 --> 00:49:45.507]  We'll talk about it this week.
[00:49:45.627 --> 00:49:46.068]  I yield back.
[00:49:47.528 --> 00:49:56.517]   You know, I've had the opportunity, I don't know if I'd quite call it a privilege to meet our politicians, but I've had the opportunity to meet a lot of our politicians.
[00:49:57.757 --> 00:50:00.579]  And I can tell you, Lauren Boebert is a real person.
[00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:03.061]  Chip Roy is a real person.
[00:50:03.121 --> 00:50:04.922]  Marjorie Taylor Greene is a real person.
[00:50:04.942 --> 00:50:06.123]  These are real people.
[00:50:07.764 --> 00:50:13.668]  And when I meet Democrats like Al Greene, I mean, they're just the fakest people on earth, folks.
[00:50:13.708 --> 00:50:14.568]  They're total frauds.
[00:50:16.169 --> 00:50:17.170]  They're just total frauds.
[00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:18.631]  And they know they're frauds.
[00:50:18.651 --> 00:50:20.792]  You can't be a Democrat without being a fraud and a liar.
[00:50:22.008 --> 00:50:23.508]  You can't hold these double standards.
[00:50:23.528 --> 00:50:26.949]  You can't have these policies unless you're just a total fraud and a liar.
[00:50:27.869 --> 00:50:31.350]  You cannot be a Democrat unless you are a lying fraud.
[00:50:35.431 --> 00:50:42.732]  We need to encourage more to be like Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massey and Chip Roy and Lauren Boebert and Matt Gaetz.
[00:50:44.273 --> 00:50:46.153]  We've probably got maybe 25.
[00:50:45.993 --> 00:50:55.080]   maybe 25. Maybe 25 real patriots Real good, honest people.
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:57.901]  They're actually upholding their oath to the Constitution.
[00:50:57.921 --> 00:51:13.686]  We might have about 25 of them in Congress, and we need to be praying for them every night, and we need to be praying that reinforcements come for them every night, and we need to make sure that we prop up the right people heading into this midterm, that we do get reinforcement for those great patriots.
[00:51:14.606 --> 00:51:17.447]  And don't forget now, but how could you forget?
[00:51:17.467 --> 00:51:26.346]   I forgot to tell you that Clay Clark is coming up in 30 minutes, and then he's going to be hosting the third hour of the Alex Jones Show today.
[00:51:26.406 --> 00:51:27.586]  He's got great guests coming up.
[00:51:27.626 --> 00:51:34.769]  Paul Joseph Watson hosting the fourth hour, and then I'll be back hosting the War Room later this afternoon as well.
[00:51:34.629 --> 00:51:41.629]   But ladies and gentlemen, let me just explain something here.
[00:51:41.629 --> 00:51:49.629]   You know, Alex Jones being out is kind of like the Bulls without Michael Jordan.
[00:51:50.518 --> 00:51:55.697]  Interest is down, ticket sales are down, victories are down, and so, uh...
[00:51:57.403 --> 00:52:10.089]  When Alex takes a vacation and I fill in, a lot of people tune out when they see me hosting, hear me hosting, and a lot of people don't go to the website, a lot of people don't go and shop at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:52:10.929 --> 00:52:13.270]  So call it the Michael Jordan bulls phenomenon.
[00:52:13.310 --> 00:52:17.472]  When Jordan isn't on the bulls, people lose interest drastically.
[00:52:17.592 --> 00:52:19.633]  Sales and everything goes down.
[00:52:20.074 --> 00:52:24.797]   So folks, I'm asking you to pick up The loss is here for me.
[00:52:25.698 --> 00:52:27.499]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today.

[00:53:04.317 --> 00:53:06.439]  He's really, I think, enjoyed his time off.
[00:53:07.544 --> 00:53:11.845]  And we're not hearing as much from him as we normally are, so hey, that's good.
[00:53:11.865 --> 00:53:13.426]  I hope Alex is enjoying his time off.

[00:55:14.065 --> 00:55:15.006]  Tulsi Gabbard.
[00:55:15.627 --> 00:55:27.582]  It's really too bad she's not in Congress anymore, but she was on with Jesse Watters last night and she was talking about the double standard in the Democrat Party and how much it ticks her off in clip 16.
[00:55:27.722 --> 00:55:29.825]  Congresswoman.
[00:55:30.999 --> 00:55:34.062]  How does it make you feel when you see people just get away with things?
[00:55:34.122 --> 00:55:38.746]  If your mugshot was out from a DUI mine, come on, it would be out there.
[00:55:39.026 --> 00:55:46.453]  Or you smoke crack, waved around a loaded hot gun in front of a prostitute, do you think you'd be able to get away with that, Tulsi?
[00:55:46.473 --> 00:55:49.896]  The answer is no, but also I would never do any of those things, first of all.
[00:55:50.296 --> 00:55:52.299]  Let's just put that out there straight.
[00:55:52.319 --> 00:55:53.640]  Thanks for clearing that up.
[00:55:54.361 --> 00:55:55.242]  It pisses me off.
[00:55:55.302 --> 00:56:01.990]  You know, it is this double standard that you're talking about between those in power and then there's the rest of us.
[00:56:02.831 --> 00:56:04.914]  We see it all the examples that you showed here.
[00:56:05.334 --> 00:56:08.759]  We see it with this insider trading that Pelosi does.
[00:56:08.979 --> 00:56:13.479]   and has been doing for quite some time, but is also very blatantly advocating for.
[00:56:13.479 --> 00:56:18.838]   I introduced legislation in Congress to prohibit members of Congress and their spouses from
[00:56:18.838 --> 00:56:23.939]   trading in stocks, period, for even any perception of insider trading, because your job is to
[00:56:23.939 --> 00:56:28.498]   serve the people and not, you know, cushion your own bank account.
[00:56:28.498 --> 00:56:31.538]   But one of the hypocritical things I see, you pointed out a number of them.
[00:56:31.639 --> 00:56:47.903]  One of the hypocritical things I see here is that President Biden and his administration take a lot of time touting how great our democracy is around the world and how we follow the rule of law and so on and so forth, and that autocracies with oligarchs should look to us to copy what we do.
[00:56:48.043 --> 00:57:00.411]   And yet we have this living example of the oligarchs Of America, in people like Pelosi and Joe Biden and Hunter Biden, showing exactly what our democracy should not be.
[00:57:01.172 --> 00:57:16.904]  If you're some king or some psychoautocrat and you see some of the crooked stuff that's going on in this country with Hunter, the money, with Pauli P, all this stuff, you got political opponents being shackled with leg irons, hauled off a plane.
[00:57:17.264 --> 00:57:19.186]  Come on, you can't make hay out of hay.
[00:57:19.026 --> 00:57:23.466]   of that in a little propaganda piece. Exactly. And if you describe that without talking about
[00:57:23.466 --> 00:57:27.385]   names or where it was taking place, that's what a normal person would think. Like, what
[00:57:27.385 --> 00:57:31.385]   foreign country is this happening in? Because that's not the America our founders envisioned
[00:57:31.385 --> 00:57:35.946]   for us. That's not what we are supposed to be about in this country. And that's where
[00:57:35.946 --> 00:57:41.225]   it's just so disheartening to see that the very people we have in charge are the ones
[00:57:41.225 --> 00:57:44.146]   dishonoring that vision our founders had and abusing that power.
[00:57:44.218 --> 00:57:48.563]  Yeah, I mean, we couldn't get the mugshot, so we had to do a sketch.
[00:57:48.683 --> 00:57:53.208]  Some of the producers put together a sketch of what we think maybe the mugshot would look like.
[00:57:54.269 --> 00:57:55.290]  And we'll show that for you.
[00:57:55.330 --> 00:57:56.571]  We put it up earlier in the week.
[00:57:56.972 --> 00:58:02.758]  And this Amanda woman, who runs the California Highway Patrol... Oh, I've got news on her coming up.
[00:58:02.858 --> 00:58:06.001]  You can't have someone, there she is, you can't have someone arrested.
[00:58:06.462 --> 00:58:13.850]  And if you, you know, they're numbers up, if you're interested in we are and getting the mugshot and the body cam footage, you know, that's how you contact her.
[00:58:14.511 --> 00:58:15.712]  It's a political position.
[00:58:16.133 --> 00:58:20.938]  Obviously knows she's got a little hot potato sitting in the department's office.
[00:58:21.338 --> 00:58:25.361]  And she can't not know that they're not releasing it.
[00:58:25.661 --> 00:58:28.543]  I mean, we've been banging the door down, so what is she hiding?
[00:58:28.723 --> 00:58:30.385]  Yeah, I mean, that is the real question.
[00:58:30.405 --> 00:58:57.863]   When you're showing that picture and you're looking at this person who's in a leadership position of those who wear the uniform who are charged with enforcing the law, And you see this intentional cover-up, you see this very direct and blatant abuse of power, is exactly why people start to lose faith and trust in these institutions that are supposed to represent the rule of law, and that are supposed to represent the best public interest, not the interest of Nancy Pelosi and her husband.
[00:58:57.963 --> 00:58:58.224]  Alright.
[00:58:58.424 --> 00:58:59.625]  Tulsi Gabbard, thank you so much.
[00:58:59.685 --> 00:59:00.185]  Thank you, Jesse.
[00:59:00.205 --> 00:59:02.466]  Alright, coming up... So there you go.
[00:59:02.587 --> 00:59:07.070]  Man, now you see why they kept Tulsi Gabbard off the Democrat debate stage.
[00:59:07.090 --> 00:59:07.490]  Remember that?
[00:59:08.424 --> 00:59:10.324]  Remember Tulsi running for President as a Democrat?
[00:59:10.344 --> 00:59:11.725]  They kept her off the debate stage?
[00:59:13.145 --> 00:59:13.365]  Yeah.
[00:59:14.645 --> 00:59:15.525]  I think it's pretty obvious.
[00:59:15.745 --> 00:59:16.365]  We know why.
[00:59:16.385 --> 00:59:18.286]  Is Tulsi Gabbard perfect?
[00:59:18.366 --> 00:59:18.866]  Absolutely not.
[00:59:18.886 --> 00:59:20.046]  Do I agree with all of her stances?
[00:59:20.146 --> 00:59:20.786]  Absolutely not.
[00:59:21.486 --> 00:59:26.527]  But, uh, is she a complete, dishonest, lying criminal like most Democrats?
[00:59:26.947 --> 00:59:27.667]  Absolutely not.
[00:59:28.608 --> 00:59:30.768]  And that's why they kept her off the debate stage.
[00:59:31.568 --> 00:59:34.189]  That's why they couldn't let Tulsi Gabbard have her time.
[00:59:35.449 --> 00:59:36.529]  Maybe she'll try to come back.
[00:59:37.725 --> 00:59:45.148]  But see, they let Bernie Sanders get his time because they know at the end of the day Bernie Sanders is going to lay down to whatever the Democrats want him to do.
[00:59:45.228 --> 00:59:53.771]  But I've got other news updates coming in the next segment in regards to what she was just talking about with the double standards.
[00:59:53.791 --> 00:59:57.893]  But quickly here, we do have multiple caravans heading to the southern border.
[00:59:57.933 --> 00:59:58.993]  Here's an image of one of them.
[00:59:59.914 --> 01:00:00.514]  It's on the way.
[01:00:00.634 --> 01:00:04.415]  There's multiple caravans like this, 10,000 plus strong.
[01:00:04.756 --> 01:00:05.576]  They're all on their way.
[01:00:07.883 --> 01:00:10.365]  10,000 people a day illegally cross the U.S.
[01:00:10.405 --> 01:00:10.705]  border.
[01:00:11.186 --> 01:00:15.830]  The Border Patrol under Biden is actually just a trafficking organization now.
[01:00:16.050 --> 01:00:19.132]  It's actually just a human trafficking element now.
[01:00:19.233 --> 01:00:20.754]  And I'm not blaming Border Patrol.
[01:00:20.794 --> 01:00:21.775]  They were put in this position.
[01:00:21.795 --> 01:00:23.456]  But here's Beto O'Rourke.
[01:00:23.476 --> 01:00:25.798]  He's on the campaign trail in Clip 3.
[01:00:26.619 --> 01:00:30.642]  Beto, I'm going to... Bob, I'm going to start calling him Bob O'Rourke.
[01:00:30.662 --> 01:00:31.183]  That's his real name.
[01:00:31.763 --> 01:00:34.666]  Bob O'Rourke, how are we looking there at the southern border?
[01:00:35.691 --> 01:00:38.092]  We all agree that we want the border to be better.
[01:00:38.112 --> 01:00:40.674]  In fact, I think the border's pretty great right now.
[01:00:41.414 --> 01:00:41.494]  Oh!
[01:00:42.275 --> 01:00:42.595]  Oh, okay.
[01:00:42.995 --> 01:00:46.037]  So, two million illegal immigrant entries a year.
[01:00:46.657 --> 01:00:53.301]  Two million criminal illegal immigrant entries a year is a good thing, according to Bob O'Rourke.
[01:00:53.661 --> 01:00:56.403]  Bob O'Rourke, running for governor.
[01:00:56.523 --> 01:00:58.184]  You know why they get so mad when you don't call him Beto?
[01:00:58.204 --> 01:00:59.224]  Because they know that's a fake name.
[01:00:59.244 --> 01:00:59.825]  His name's Bob.
[01:01:01.036 --> 01:01:07.778]  Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro casts doubt on Joe Biden's 2020 election win.
[01:01:09.618 --> 01:01:10.859]  He's about to meet with him too.
[01:01:11.779 --> 01:01:12.139]  Oh really?
[01:01:12.159 --> 01:01:14.160]  You mean the guy that couldn't fill a broom closet?
[01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:16.620]  The guy that had to cancel presidential debates?
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:22.642]  The guy who got called out for being racist and too old on the Democrat debate stage?
[01:01:23.102 --> 01:01:24.622]  The guy who didn't ever win a debate?
[01:01:25.562 --> 01:01:26.963]  Got more votes than Obama?
[01:01:28.001 --> 01:01:28.762]  You believe that, huh?
[01:01:29.002 --> 01:01:31.324]  You must be a liberal Democrat if you believe that.
[01:01:32.105 --> 01:01:33.206]  Bolsonaro knows better.
[01:01:34.187 --> 01:01:37.690]  So, interesting commentary coming from him before he meets with Joe Biden.
[01:01:39.492 --> 01:01:40.333]  But, yeah.
[01:01:40.493 --> 01:01:44.737]  I mean, if you don't question Joe Biden's election victory, you're a brainwashed fool.
[01:01:45.938 --> 01:01:48.161]  But, you know, here's the answer.
[01:01:50.726 --> 01:01:55.969]  Otero County, New Mexico, and this may still be live, guys.
[01:01:56.209 --> 01:01:59.371]  I actually checked it out this morning, just briefly.
[01:02:00.872 --> 01:02:08.976]  But, Otero County, New Mexico, meeting livestream now, hearing to remove voting machines from elections.
[01:02:10.857 --> 01:02:13.199]  To remove voting machines from elections.
[01:02:14.259 --> 01:02:19.142]  That's, again, you know, it's, look, there's things that happen in life.
[01:02:20.558 --> 01:02:26.100]  Where the solution to problems are not good, but it's the solution after all.
[01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:31.501]  And if you don't enact the solution, well, then the problem is worse, right?
[01:02:32.022 --> 01:02:35.843]  So, I mean, here's a personal example.
[01:02:37.023 --> 01:02:43.965]  You've got gout or gangrene or something on your leg, and the doctor tells you you're going to have to amputate that leg or it's going to kill you.
[01:02:44.565 --> 01:02:45.966]  But do you want to not have a leg?
[01:02:46.146 --> 01:02:46.766]  Absolutely not.
[01:02:46.826 --> 01:02:47.586]  But do you want to die?
[01:02:47.886 --> 01:02:48.107]  No.
[01:02:48.307 --> 01:02:49.427]  So you're amputating that leg.
[01:02:50.771 --> 01:02:51.452]  School shootings.
[01:02:53.194 --> 01:02:54.555]  Okay, we want to stop school shootings.
[01:02:54.595 --> 01:02:58.520]  Let's put an armed guard or multiple armed guards at the schools.
[01:02:59.681 --> 01:03:00.382]  Do we want that?
[01:03:00.422 --> 01:03:02.684]  Do we like that we have to have armed guards at schools?
[01:03:02.724 --> 01:03:05.227]  Do we want a military zone in a school?
[01:03:05.387 --> 01:03:06.128]  No, absolutely not.
[01:03:06.208 --> 01:03:08.190]  But is it going to stop the next school shooting?
[01:03:08.531 --> 01:03:08.911]  It will.
[01:03:09.011 --> 01:03:09.732]  So we go with it.
[01:03:10.873 --> 01:03:12.175]  Same thing with the voting machines.
[01:03:13.919 --> 01:03:16.219]  Do we want to hand count ballots?
[01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:20.860]  Do we want to do hand counting of millions of paper ballots for our elections?
[01:03:21.121 --> 01:03:21.401]  No!
[01:03:21.701 --> 01:03:25.842]  We have technology and that's very, really painstaking and it takes a long time.
[01:03:25.882 --> 01:03:26.722]  We'd rather not do that.
[01:03:26.882 --> 01:03:33.103]  But, if that's the only way to make sure we have real elections that aren't rigged, then yeah, let's do that.
[01:03:34.143 --> 01:03:37.724]  So that's the hearing that's going on right now in New Mexico.
[01:03:38.484 --> 01:03:41.645]  Two Utah moms file open records requests on election records.
[01:03:42.912 --> 01:03:44.053]  Democrats didn't like that.
[01:03:44.474 --> 01:03:50.500]  State Lieutenant Governor tips off reporter and blocks them from accessing them and then calls in the Feds.
[01:03:51.701 --> 01:03:53.803]  Oh, you want to look into Democrats cheating in elections?
[01:03:53.883 --> 01:03:56.426]  Don't worry, the Feds are going to be breathing down your neck threatening you the next day.
[01:03:58.581 --> 01:03:59.742]  Hunter Biden's hookers.
[01:04:00.582 --> 01:04:01.363]  There's plenty of those.
[01:04:01.723 --> 01:04:13.212]  Hunter Biden's favorite Las Vegas hooker got $20,000 federal PPP loan for female-owned sole proprietorship after Joe Biden took office.
[01:04:13.932 --> 01:04:15.013]  That's an expensive hooker.
[01:04:17.254 --> 01:04:18.435]  $20,000 for Hunter's favorite hooker.
[01:04:19.076 --> 01:04:21.077]  You think Joe got a little side job there, too?
[01:04:22.138 --> 01:04:24.720]  Do you think Hunter and Joe are Eskimo brothers?
[01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:30.042]  I better stop, because I could go real dark with that.
[01:04:30.602 --> 01:04:41.907]  But I know Hunter is Eskimo brothers with his deceased brother, because he was sleeping with his sister-in-law, and Joe Biden said that was a good thing.
[01:04:42.748 --> 01:04:45.929]  And of course we know about Joe Biden showering with his daughter inappropriately.
[01:04:45.969 --> 01:04:47.070]  She wrote about that in her diary.
[01:04:49.191 --> 01:04:52.693]  So $20,000 from the government to Hunter Biden's hooker.
[01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:54.740]  Must be great.
[01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:56.981]  You know the old movie?
[01:04:57.641 --> 01:04:59.301]  It's good to be king, or what's it called?
[01:04:59.321 --> 01:04:59.881]  The King and Me?
[01:05:00.202 --> 01:05:02.002]  And they have that song, it's good to be king.
[01:05:02.482 --> 01:05:03.682]  It's good to be a Democrat.
[01:05:04.323 --> 01:05:05.423]  It's good to be a Biden.
[01:05:05.483 --> 01:05:09.104]  You can rape, pillage, plunder, and nothing happens to you.
[01:05:09.224 --> 01:05:10.224]  Like Paul Pelosi.
[01:05:10.704 --> 01:05:11.444]  Donald Trump Jr.
[01:05:11.484 --> 01:05:16.827]   asked the question, did anyone really believe Here's some of the numbers.
[01:05:16.907 --> 01:05:17.867]  Here's some of the numbers here.
[01:05:17.707 --> 01:05:23.187]   DUI crash, anyone who's been paying attention knows that the rules don't apply to Democrats.
[01:05:23.187 --> 01:05:27.907]   They just want you to abide by what they say, not what they do.
[01:05:27.907 --> 01:05:29.907]  Recurring theme.
[01:05:29.907 --> 01:05:35.867]  And here's some of the numbers.
[01:05:35.867 --> 01:05:46.226]   Here's some of the numbers here on perhaps why Paul Pelosi's mugshot and DUI were never
[01:05:46.226 --> 01:05:47.226]  a thing.
[01:05:47.226 --> 01:05:48.827]  just completely memory hold.
[01:05:49.335 --> 01:05:53.819]  Gavin Newsom appointed California Highway Patrol Commissioner Amanda Ray.
[01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:56.522]  She receives more than $250,000 in her yearly salary.
[01:05:56.362 --> 01:06:00.442]  $150,000 in her yearly salary.
[01:06:00.442 --> 01:06:05.121]  She gets bonuses of $76,000 plus a year.
[01:06:05.121 --> 01:06:10.162]   And she also receives more than $145,000 in benefits per year.
[01:06:10.672 --> 01:06:15.974]  So a yearly salary for the Highway Patrol Commissioner Amanda Ray is almost $500,000.
[01:06:17.995 --> 01:06:21.937]  She knows where her bread is buttered.
[01:06:22.357 --> 01:06:23.898]  She knows who signs her paychecks.
[01:06:24.138 --> 01:06:24.998]  It's the Democrats.
[01:06:26.559 --> 01:06:29.220]  Still wonder why Paul Pelosi's DUI case was dropped?
[01:06:31.713 --> 01:06:32.633]  Still wonder?
[01:06:33.414 --> 01:06:35.254]  Oh, but she's the first black woman!
[01:06:35.695 --> 01:06:36.095]  Ooh!
[01:06:36.575 --> 01:06:37.555]  First black woman!
[01:06:38.156 --> 01:06:40.036]  Has nothing to do with skin color, has nothing to do with woman.
[01:06:40.056 --> 01:06:42.417]  It has to do with, are you a good Democrat?
[01:06:42.977 --> 01:06:44.338]  Will you protect our own?
[01:06:44.418 --> 01:06:46.359]  Will you let Democrats get away with crimes?
[01:06:46.699 --> 01:06:48.299]  The answer is yes.
[01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:51.060]  The proof is Paul Pelosi.
[01:06:52.481 --> 01:07:02.256]   Now, remember, an innocent man, once again, And innocent Democrats going after innocent people left and right.
[01:07:02.676 --> 01:07:03.836]  Believe me, I know all about that.
[01:07:03.856 --> 01:07:04.336]  I'm one of them.
[01:07:05.336 --> 01:07:06.137]  Peter Navarro.
[01:07:07.237 --> 01:07:10.558]  Now, folks, this is such a weird thing.
[01:07:11.838 --> 01:07:19.940]  So first of all, they go after Peter Navarro for contempt of court because he won't turn over executive records.
[01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:21.520]  But here's the problem.
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:27.365]  Peter Navarro can't turn over executive records.
[01:07:28.106 --> 01:07:30.570]  Only Donald Trump can turn over those records.
[01:07:30.890 --> 01:07:33.213]  So they demand all these records from Navarro.
[01:07:34.195 --> 01:07:39.702]   Peter Navarro with his lawyers say, Hey look, maybe they want to cooperate, maybe they don't.
[01:07:39.742 --> 01:07:44.885]  But they say, hey look, all the records you requested, we can't give them to you.
[01:07:44.905 --> 01:07:46.406]  We don't have the executive privilege.
[01:07:47.306 --> 01:07:49.627]  If you want these records, you have to get them from Donald Trump.
[01:07:49.667 --> 01:07:50.768]  You can't get them from us.
[01:07:51.428 --> 01:07:53.469]  If we release them to you, that would be illegal.
[01:07:53.489 --> 01:07:54.310]  That would be treason.
[01:07:54.410 --> 01:07:56.411]  So no, we're not releasing the executive records.
[01:07:56.811 --> 01:07:57.811]  That would be breaking the law.
[01:07:57.831 --> 01:07:58.692]  You have to go for Donald Trump.
[01:07:59.012 --> 01:08:02.334]  So the Democrats say, okay, you're not going to release the executive records?
[01:08:02.354 --> 01:08:04.655]  We're just going to arrest you then and hold you in contempt of court.
[01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:09.801]  You won't break the law for Democrats, so they arrest you and hold you in contempt of court.
[01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:15.212]  But see, Peter Navarro wasn't intimidated and wasn't silenced.
[01:08:15.892 --> 01:08:17.232]  So he was talking to the media.
[01:08:17.272 --> 01:08:18.413]  He was doing TV interviews.
[01:08:19.153 --> 01:08:20.594]  So now they're gagging him!
[01:08:21.314 --> 01:08:34.459]  Biden's DOJ applies for gag order on indicted Trump advisor Peter Navarro over claims he is creating a carnival atmosphere with his media appearances and accusing the FBI of a terrorist strategy.
[01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:37.820]  You mean the FBI that tried to kidnap Governor Whitmer?
[01:08:38.421 --> 01:08:38.781]  That FBI?
[01:08:40.776 --> 01:08:57.481]  Remember they had the Justice for January 6th event earlier this year and there are some Trump supporters out there and the Capitol Police were so desperate to find an armed Trump supporter they arrested a couple armed individuals at the Justice for J6 rally.
[01:08:57.841 --> 01:08:59.942]  The problem was they were feds.
[01:09:00.942 --> 01:09:01.342]  Feds!
[01:09:03.443 --> 01:09:09.085]  So now they're so afraid of Peter Navarro talking that they're trying to have a gag order placed on him.
[01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:10.365]  What?
[01:09:11.872 --> 01:09:13.675]  Folks, we're not in America anymore.
[01:09:14.196 --> 01:09:23.790]  We're in an authoritarian dictatorship with an evil, corrupt entity, a terroristic hate group called the Democrat Party.
[01:09:24.011 --> 01:09:26.354]  And they're purging anyone that's not a Democrat from the FBI.
[01:09:27.722 --> 01:09:32.208]  Welcome back to this live Thursday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:09:32.248 --> 01:09:37.516]  Owen Schroyer is about to take over with more breaking news and guests and your calls here in a moment.
[01:09:38.217 --> 01:09:42.022]  But I wanted to just make a very, very important and a very exciting announcement.
[01:09:42.719 --> 01:09:44.000]  We're living in critical times.
[01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:45.841]  We're living in historic times.
[01:09:45.861 --> 01:09:51.123]  But I can tell you that while I'm on the road, the public is even more awake than they've ever been.
[01:09:51.263 --> 01:09:54.725]  Black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young, you name it.
[01:09:54.805 --> 01:10:00.908]  I have been mobbed while I've been on the road on this business trip here on the West Coast.
[01:10:01.748 --> 01:10:06.651]  And it has been just very, very heartening to see this happen.
[01:10:07.111 --> 01:10:20.609]   Almost everybody I talk to says, Hey, because the mainstream media attacked you and demonized you, I went to check out who you were in the last few years, and researched what you were saying and found out it was true, and now I'm telling everybody else about the broadcast.
[01:10:22.331 --> 01:10:28.315]  They said, when the system is so corrupt and so evil, and they're attacking somebody, we know you must be good.
[01:10:28.756 --> 01:10:30.637]  And then we went and checked you out and found out you were.
[01:10:31.458 --> 01:10:34.380]  So the good news is, people are really waking up.
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:37.803]  The bad news is the globalists know that, and they're making their move right now.
[01:10:38.783 --> 01:10:50.005]  Now that said, they have a plan to slowly cut off the food and the energy, we're already deep into that operation, to bring people to their knees so they can bring in their Great Reset and their Build Back Better program.
[01:10:50.385 --> 01:11:00.947]  That's why we've got to continue to expose their agenda and that it's the Davos group and the globalists that are behind this or they'll be able to pose as the saviors and sell the next leg of their operation.
[01:11:01.167 --> 01:11:09.099]   Now, everybody knows that, you don't need me to tell you that, but the point is, The general public has not completely figured that out yet.
[01:11:09.179 --> 01:11:11.981]  When they do, it's game over for the New World Order.
[01:11:12.461 --> 01:11:14.523]  Now, here's a really important announcement I want to make.
[01:11:15.464 --> 01:11:18.466]  We've been selling high-quality, storable food for over a decade.
[01:11:18.646 --> 01:11:25.351]  We've been partnered with MyPatriotSupply, the biggest and best fit out there with quality food, the lowest price you're going to find to get quality food.
[01:11:25.391 --> 01:11:33.316]  You can find stuff that's cheaper, but it's not nearly as good, and they almost always make you wait months to get it, and in many cases, you don't even get it.
[01:11:34.017 --> 01:11:35.298]  With MyPatriot, you get it.
[01:11:35.982 --> 01:11:38.085]  That's because they've got warehouses all over the U.S.
[01:11:38.265 --> 01:11:40.848]  They buy food a year out with their contracts.
[01:11:41.309 --> 01:11:47.496]  They have been pre-positioned to not have to raise prices while everybody else has been having to raise prices.
[01:11:47.516 --> 01:11:50.400]  The last time they raised prices was just a little bit a year ago.
[01:11:51.118 --> 01:11:56.240]  They are going to have to raise prices soon because the inflation, as you know, and the food shortages are accelerating.
[01:11:56.540 --> 01:12:02.622]  But they have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of quality food items in stock, stockpiled.
[01:12:03.043 --> 01:12:06.584]  And for the next few months, they are going to be able to ship within days.
[01:12:07.084 --> 01:12:16.428]  Current orders coming in to preparetoday.com are shipping within 24 hours, unless you order like on a Saturday, then it will be 48 hours.
[01:12:17.008 --> 01:12:19.489]  Ladies and gentlemen, you need to take action.
[01:12:20.429 --> 01:12:38.700]  Right now this funds the operation, but that's secondary the system wants you dependent on them and the only way to beat inflation is to buy high-quality storable food and other items that you can use in the future that you buy at a lower price today, so It's streamlined.
[01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:40.120]  It's all on one site.
[01:12:40.741 --> 01:12:41.741]  They run the whole thing.
[01:12:42.021 --> 01:12:48.957]   It's their entire back end It's their entire spectrum of products hundreds and hundreds of of not just high quality, affordable foods,
[01:12:48.957 --> 01:12:52.957]   but other preparedness and survival items at the lowest prices you're gonna find
[01:12:52.957 --> 01:12:59.597]   because they are able to buy it in bulk and then pass those savings on to you.
[01:12:59.597 --> 01:13:02.278]  So this is a total 360 win.
[01:13:02.278 --> 01:13:07.378]   Go to preparetoday.com or follow the link preparewithalex.com.
[01:13:07.378 --> 01:13:12.838]   That also takes you there and you will find all these great items that are ready to ship
[01:13:13.636 --> 01:13:23.945]  So you'll save money on inflation, you'll be prepared and not dependent on the system, and you'll help keep him for wars on the year at this critical time at preparetoday.com.
[01:13:24.366 --> 01:13:36.625]   Now in a few months there may be a couple week wait to get your food and that's why the last three months I stopped promoting food because a weight was developing for the first time in many years.
[01:13:37.145 --> 01:13:39.947]  Most places are completely sold out and can't even really take your order.
[01:13:40.427 --> 01:13:51.873]  Now the food is in stock, it's stockpiled, it's been processed, and it's ready to ship to you very, very quickly at, again, preparetoday.com.
[01:13:52.894 --> 01:13:58.317]  Hyperinflation is expanding, food shortages are increasing, the baby formula is just the beginning.
[01:14:01.138 --> 01:14:01.605]  Exploded.
[01:14:02.759 --> 01:14:04.200]  Not just here, but also in Europe.
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:11.024]  This is a strategic globalist plan to bring down civilization, and they think we're going to be caught flat-footed, but our listeners are not.
[01:14:11.444 --> 01:14:15.767]  So get a 360 win at preparetoday.com.
[01:14:16.647 --> 01:14:18.388]  Also, you can visit infowarsstore.com.
[01:14:18.408 --> 01:14:23.251]  There's a link to the site there, but we are not selling the food now at infowarsstore.com.
[01:14:23.871 --> 01:14:26.453]  That way we don't have to take the order and then have them drop ship it.
[01:14:26.293 --> 01:14:31.733]   but that way it goes right through preparetoday.com, but then InfoWars gets the credit
[01:14:31.733 --> 01:14:33.493]  and some of the funding to keep us on air.
[01:14:33.493 --> 01:14:36.693]  So please go to preparetoday.com.
[01:14:36.693 --> 01:14:40.253]   And I'm gonna hand the baton back to Owen Schroer, live from Austin, Texas.
[01:14:40.253 --> 01:14:41.253]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:14:41.253 --> 01:14:44.332]   And we're back here live in the InfoWars World Headquarters.
[01:14:44.332 --> 01:14:46.812]  And...
[01:14:46.763 --> 01:14:56.968]  And I've got Clay Clark with me for this and the next segment, and then he's going to be taking over hosting the third hour with a great guest, Dr. Jim Meehan.
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:00.301]  Wow, Clay.
[01:15:00.702 --> 01:15:02.283]  So much developing right now.
[01:15:03.203 --> 01:15:08.887]  I do have some questions, some vaccine topics, some monkeypox topics for you.
[01:15:09.467 --> 01:15:10.848]  But what's on your radar?
[01:15:10.888 --> 01:15:13.070]  What's your big story at Thrive Time Show?
[01:15:14.488 --> 01:15:19.371]  Well, you know, I made a... I want to get prepared for your audience, so I had 17 talking points ready to go.
[01:15:19.411 --> 01:15:20.332]  I'll just hit a couple of them.
[01:15:20.692 --> 01:15:29.938]  The first one is there's this document called the Nuclear Threat Initiative, an organization called the Nuclear Threat Initiative that put out a document, which all your listeners, go there right now.
[01:15:29.998 --> 01:15:33.100]  Go to timetofreeamerica.com and click on the monkey face button.
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:34.001]  There's a face of a monkey.
[01:15:34.341 --> 01:15:35.362]  You click the monkey face.
[01:15:35.442 --> 01:15:36.523]  It's the monkey pox button.
[01:15:36.783 --> 01:15:41.586]  And you click there, you can read the document that was created by the Nuclear Threat Initiative 15 months ago.
[01:15:41.986 --> 01:15:56.657]   And this particular document, when you click it, If you go to page 12, it says that there will be a monkeypox outbreak beginning in America, beginning in the world, you'll start to see it in the world, beginning May 15th, May 15th of 2022.
[01:15:56.858 --> 01:16:04.443]  And then starting June 5th of 2022, it will reach an all out outbreak status.
[01:16:05.044 --> 01:16:10.468]  And so in seemingly in disbelief, oh, and this was sent to me 12 months ago, and I didn't want to believe it.
[01:16:10.488 --> 01:16:11.449]  I received it from a listener.
[01:16:12.049 --> 01:16:15.631]  And I read the document and I thought, well, I'm going to look into this organization.
[01:16:15.651 --> 01:16:17.072]  It was founded 21 years ago.
[01:16:17.893 --> 01:16:19.314]  It's funded by Bill and Melinda Gates.
[01:16:19.834 --> 01:16:23.676]  It was allegedly started by Ted Turner, you know, Ted Turner.
[01:16:24.157 --> 01:16:28.139]  And this organization is located in Washington, D.C.
[01:16:28.179 --> 01:16:29.220]  And so I read the document.
[01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:29.860]  I thought, you know what?
[01:16:30.421 --> 01:16:31.801]  I'm not even going to go down there.
[01:16:31.821 --> 01:16:32.382]  I don't want to be taught.
[01:16:32.402 --> 01:16:33.342]  I don't want to scare people.
[01:16:33.362 --> 01:16:37.705]  I don't want to talk about monkey pox and the next outbreak until we get through the COVID outbreak.
[01:16:37.745 --> 01:16:39.146]  And let's just see if this actually happens.
[01:16:39.781 --> 01:16:41.962]  And then Carter, to my right, you work in our office.
[01:16:41.982 --> 01:16:43.583]  Carter helps process ticket requests.
[01:16:43.883 --> 01:16:48.445]  And Carter, lo and behold, what started happening about two weeks ago as it relates to monkey pox?
[01:16:48.585 --> 01:16:53.287]  Oh, a lot of stories started popping up about, you know, monkey pox outbreak here, monkey pox outbreak there.
[01:16:53.307 --> 01:16:55.048]  And it's happening everywhere.
[01:16:55.268 --> 01:17:02.011]  And so all of a sudden, if you go to Google right now or DuckDuckGo and you type monkey pox and you click on news, you're going to see that's the story.
[01:17:02.051 --> 01:17:05.192]  And Owen, I'm going to tell your listeners out there, this is the argument that's being made right now.
[01:17:05.652 --> 01:17:21.539]  The World Health Organization is saying that they have teamed up with all these countries, these strategic partners, and they've all agreed that in the event of an outbreak of any kind, they all need to team up together to stop an outbreak, no matter where in the world the outbreak begins.
[01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:24.601]  Because an outbreak in any country is a threat to all countries.
[01:17:25.021 --> 01:17:36.747]  And so therefore, the World Health Organization is setting up the narrative to deploy foreign assets into sovereign nations to stop the spread of a monkeypox outbreak.
[01:17:36.807 --> 01:17:43.070]  And so right now, people are going to TimeToFreeAmerica.com and they're asking me, they're saying, are you still going to do the Reawaken America tour in Virginia?
[01:17:43.331 --> 01:17:48.113]  I mean, I know you guys have a packed lineup and Zelenko's coming and Eric Trump's coming, but what about monkeypox?
[01:17:48.453 --> 01:17:51.875]  But Carter, we're going to do the event regardless of monkeypox.
[01:17:52.095 --> 01:17:52.315]  Right.
[01:17:52.395 --> 01:17:53.736]  Well, and let's be clear here, Clay.
[01:17:54.136 --> 01:17:54.916]  They're lying.
[01:17:54.936 --> 01:18:00.099]  The World Health Organization is lying because monkeypox is a regular thing in Africa.
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:03.641]  You go look at Africa right now, there's all kinds of cases of monkeypox.
[01:18:03.661 --> 01:18:04.582]  There has been for years.
[01:18:04.862 --> 01:18:08.884]  But you know, I'm going to add another little element to your thought process here.
[01:18:10.045 --> 01:18:11.205]  It comes off of this headline.
[01:18:11.786 --> 01:18:17.029]  Monkeypox patient says he caught virus after having gay sex with around 10 new partners.
[01:18:17.689 --> 01:18:22.372]  Monkeypox outbreak linked to gay sex during gay pride month?
[01:18:23.192 --> 01:18:23.732]  I don't know.
[01:18:24.073 --> 01:18:25.253]  Maybe just another coincidence.
[01:18:26.514 --> 01:18:30.376]  Well, Owen, I always tell my office staff, I say, guys, there's two rules, OK?
[01:18:30.477 --> 01:18:31.417]  One, be on time to work.
[01:18:31.477 --> 01:18:35.099]  And two, don't engage in illicit gay sex because it may cause monkey pox.
[01:18:35.119 --> 01:18:36.080]  So that's a rule.
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:38.982]  We feel safe about that here at the Thrive Time Show.
[01:18:39.022 --> 01:18:39.802]  We feel good about it.
[01:18:39.822 --> 01:18:46.046]  But I encourage everybody out there, don't engage in homosexual, bisexual orgies, especially with somebody who has monkey pox.
[01:18:46.086 --> 01:18:47.327]  That's just a kind of a pro tip there.
[01:18:47.567 --> 01:18:48.788]  And be on time to work.
[01:18:49.108 --> 01:18:50.869]  Owen, I can't wait to harass your listeners after the break.
[01:18:51.607 --> 01:18:52.668]  We'll be right back with Clay Clark.
[01:18:52.688 --> 01:18:53.128]  Don't go anywhere.
[01:18:53.529 --> 01:18:55.110]  We're here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:57.032]  Owen Schroer filling in.
[01:18:57.432 --> 01:18:58.433]  Clay Clark is with us.
[01:18:58.473 --> 01:18:59.755]  Dr. Jim Meehan is with us.
[01:18:59.795 --> 01:19:02.297]  Thrivetimeshow.com is where you can find them.
[01:19:02.777 --> 01:19:04.679]  So many other great sources Clay has.
[01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:06.841]  The host of the Reawaken America Tour.
[01:19:07.842 --> 01:19:09.663]  To inform Americans.
[01:19:10.583 --> 01:19:16.286]  And you know, another, we're talking about monkeypox, is this going to be the new thing they use to control people?
[01:19:17.166 --> 01:19:22.309]  And it seems that they're covering their tracks better this time.
[01:19:23.029 --> 01:19:30.553]  Here's an example, NIH erased webpage details, monkeypox vaccine bioterror research, praised by Anthony Fauci.
[01:19:30.593 --> 01:19:40.419]   So, when they launched their Fake COVID pandemic, we had all the paper trails leading back to Fauci and the Wuhan lab and everything else.
[01:19:40.879 --> 01:19:48.284]  Well, now it seems they're erasing, they're quickly erasing the paper trails of all their monkeypox research and their monkeypox vaccine research and everything.
[01:19:49.324 --> 01:19:59.751]  If and when the case is there's a monkeypox outbreak, we won't be able to go back and find all the evidence that, like we found with COVID, it goes right to the lab, it goes right to Fauci.
[01:20:00.691 --> 01:20:19.438]  Well, I think what's happening here is, Dr. Jim Meehan, to my right, how he and I really got connected is that I have listeners who listen to our Thrive Time show, and we were one of the top talk business radio shows in Tulsa, Oklahoma, for three consecutive years, running opposite of Rush Limbaugh.
[01:20:19.838 --> 01:20:20.638]  On a different station.
[01:20:20.998 --> 01:20:27.960]  And our listeners would start to call me and they would say, hey, I recognize that you're saying the models that said the 2.2 million Americans would die from COVID, those are false.
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:31.701]  The PCR tests, the polymerase chain reaction tests are falsely calibrated.
[01:20:31.981 --> 01:20:36.722]  And that COVID-19 is 100% treatable with budesonide, ivermectin, and hydroxychloroquine.
[01:20:36.742 --> 01:20:39.603]  People said, you're the only show that I know on the radio that's talking about this.
[01:20:39.863 --> 01:20:44.324]  However, I can't find a freaking doctor that's willing to treat my wife or myself if I have COVID-19.
[01:20:44.944 --> 01:20:55.131]  So Dr. Meehan here from MeehanMD.com, he has been treating over 10,000 COVID patients with zero deaths, and now the phone started to ring about monkeypox.
[01:20:55.312 --> 01:21:05.679]   And so Dr. Meehan has the research he's been doing for over 20 years that a lot of it he's downloaded and he's archived, he has the PDF, so in the event That they try to remove the evidence.
[01:21:05.719 --> 01:21:10.122]  He has this, but this is clearly part of a plandemic that everybody can read.
[01:21:10.422 --> 01:21:11.683]  You can read the documentation.
[01:21:11.703 --> 01:21:16.706]  You can see the plan by going to time2freeamerica.com and clicking on the monkeypox button.
[01:21:16.726 --> 01:21:19.288]  Dr. Meehan, what do you think about this monkeypox outbreak?
[01:21:19.588 --> 01:21:21.890]  Well, personally, I think it's a distraction.
[01:21:21.950 --> 01:21:23.151]  It's an intermediary.
[01:21:23.172 --> 01:21:26.054]  They were losing the narrative with coronaviruses.
[01:21:26.074 --> 01:21:35.563]  We were all tiring of the nonsense, the lockdowns, the masking, and everything that was, the science was eventually, the truth was outing the fact that everything that they were doing was wrong.
[01:21:36.064 --> 01:21:37.625]  That they lost that narrative.
[01:21:37.665 --> 01:21:39.227]  So here comes monkeypox.
[01:21:39.267 --> 01:21:47.448]   It's a very good, you know, fear-mongering virus to use because it's got those ugly pictures of those
[01:21:47.448 --> 01:21:48.449]  horrible pustules.
[01:21:48.449 --> 01:21:49.769]  But it's not highly transmissible.
[01:21:49.769 --> 01:21:51.529]  It's a large DNA virus.
[01:21:51.529 --> 01:21:55.769]   It's not going to, it really is only going to transmit during the infectious phase.
[01:21:55.769 --> 01:21:57.369]  There is no asymptomatic spread.
[01:21:57.369 --> 01:22:00.809]   By the way, there is no asymptomatic spread for coronavirus either.
[01:22:00.809 --> 01:22:04.609]   That's another part of the narrative that was debunked by real science.
[01:22:04.609 --> 01:22:09.248]   So it's, but it's ugly and it, it, it plays well in the mainstream media.
[01:22:09.312 --> 01:22:16.654]  I think they've got something else coming because the people that paid and perpetrated the crime are still running the show.
[01:22:16.854 --> 01:22:24.977]  Anthony Fauci, the CDC, and all of those operatives are still in place running the show, running the gain-of-function research.
[01:22:25.257 --> 01:22:30.999]   They've got biolabs, perhaps 30 of them, that they're trying to Protecting Ukraine?
[01:22:31.219 --> 01:22:31.639]  I don't know.
[01:22:31.939 --> 01:22:33.080]  Hypothesis, opinion.
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:38.062]  But they've got biolabs that are still working on these problems.
[01:22:38.082 --> 01:22:39.383]  Now, Owen, I have something funny for you.
[01:22:39.403 --> 01:22:47.207]  I know you've mentioned that they're doing a better job of covering their tracks, but I have sort of a funny example of maybe how they're not doing as good of a job as maybe they should be doing.
[01:22:47.847 --> 01:22:53.250]  On June 1st, Tedros hosted a monkeypox outbreak press conference.
[01:22:53.470 --> 01:22:55.652]  And by the way, folks, we also have new characters we're gonna have to get to know.
[01:22:55.672 --> 01:23:05.459]  We got to know Burks before, and we got to know Fauci, but now we all need to get good at our impersonating Tedros, because Tedros is now the hype man for The Great Reset.
[01:23:05.659 --> 01:23:05.839]  Yeah.
[01:23:05.979 --> 01:23:15.205]   So he says, we're here to talk about the monkey books, and then I turn to my esteemed colleague, Dr. Ryan, Dr. Michael Ryan, and Dr. Michael Ryan, there's a 53-minute press conference.
[01:23:15.225 --> 01:23:16.686]  You can go watch it right now on YouTube.
[01:23:16.726 --> 01:23:19.708]  Type in World Health Organization, World Health Organization.
[01:23:19.728 --> 01:23:20.608]  You can watch the press conference.
[01:23:20.989 --> 01:23:24.891]  He only gets to speak for four minutes, and this dude is fired up, okay?
[01:23:24.911 --> 01:23:26.092]  So listen to what he says.
[01:23:26.392 --> 01:23:28.473]  Dr. Michael Ryan of the World Health Organization.
[01:23:28.493 --> 01:23:30.775]  Listen to what he said out loud during less than a minute.
[01:23:30.815 --> 01:23:31.235]  Watch this.
[01:23:31.355 --> 01:23:32.976]  Watch this healthy individual.
[01:23:33.055 --> 01:23:36.855]  This is not about stealing sovereignty from countries.
[01:23:36.855 --> 01:23:40.854]   This is about countries coming together to solve problems together.
[01:23:40.854 --> 01:23:42.535]  We've seen the climate change.
[01:23:42.535 --> 01:23:43.974]  We see with pandemics.
[01:23:43.974 --> 01:23:46.055]  There is no national solution to these.
[01:23:46.055 --> 01:23:50.455]   We need strong national systems and we need strong national commitments on climate change.
[01:23:50.455 --> 01:23:54.594]   We just need strong national commitments and preparedness, but that's not enough.
[01:23:54.594 --> 01:24:00.375]   We need to be able to come together at a global level and make the necessary commitments to do the preparedness,
[01:24:00.375 --> 01:24:05.414]   to do the prevention, to get ourselves ready and to respond effectively in the next pandemic.
[01:24:05.414 --> 01:24:07.535]   That requires a degree of- - You know what they're saying?
[01:24:07.535 --> 01:24:11.535]   We're here to talk, listen, this is Tedros tease up the press conference by saying this.
[01:24:11.535 --> 01:24:15.295]  Now for an update on monkey books.
[01:24:15.295 --> 01:24:16.695]  Now for an update on monkey books.
[01:24:16.695 --> 01:24:19.576]   And then they go over to Dr. Michael Ryan and you know, they said, listen,
[01:24:19.576 --> 01:24:23.015]  please don't, please avoid the keywords world takeover.
[01:24:23.015 --> 01:24:24.615]  You know, this is being transcribed.
[01:24:24.615 --> 01:24:26.134]  Please don't say world takeover.
[01:24:26.134 --> 01:24:27.975]  This is what he says, listen to this.
[01:24:28.271 --> 01:24:34.635]  And there is no question of any loss of sovereignty or any play by global powers to take over the world.
[01:24:34.655 --> 01:24:35.996]  This is not what this is about.
[01:24:36.056 --> 01:24:37.737]  He just said it!
[01:24:38.737 --> 01:24:41.339]  It's so ridiculous because that's literally what they're doing.
[01:24:41.379 --> 01:24:43.560]  They're up here proposing that exact same thing.
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:43.820]  It's like...
[01:24:45.021 --> 01:24:49.285]  I mean, if I, uh... I mean, I can't even think of a more ridiculous example.
[01:24:49.585 --> 01:24:50.966]  It's just, it's on its face.
[01:24:51.026 --> 01:25:01.435]  It's like, here we're having meetings talking about how we can have a global government and global health response, and by the way, look at how we locked them down in Australia, look at how we locked them down in China, look at how we locked them down in Canada, look at how we shut down the businesses.
[01:25:01.675 --> 01:25:04.237]  But we're not taking away your sovereignty!
[01:25:04.257 --> 01:25:05.358]  Come on, man!
[01:25:06.144 --> 01:25:08.585]  We're here to talk about the monkey box, Dr. Ryan, back to you.
[01:25:08.665 --> 01:25:12.146]  And Dr. Ryan's like, we're not here to talk about taking over the world.
[01:25:12.166 --> 01:25:14.267]  Yeah, this isn't about stealing your sovereignty.
[01:25:14.287 --> 01:25:16.528]  Well, we're here, and you know they're saying, stop it!
[01:25:16.788 --> 01:25:17.888]  We just talked about this!
[01:25:17.928 --> 01:25:24.350]  Let me just stop both of you right there, because you guys are about to take over and host the next hour, and so I know you've got a bunch of content.
[01:25:24.370 --> 01:25:31.793]  Let me just try to massage your thought here and get a response from you, because what do you think is really going on?
[01:25:33.013 --> 01:25:34.294]  They know what they're doing.
[01:25:35.534 --> 01:25:40.377]  They know we know what they're doing, and so that's why they're trying to cover up and lie about it.
[01:25:40.417 --> 01:25:43.399]  I mean, how bad do you think it really is?
[01:25:43.439 --> 01:25:55.826]  Do you think that they've already determined, look, the world economic system is collapsing, so let's just speed it up, let's collapse it ourselves, and then we'll sit on top of the rubble, we'll call it the Great Reset, Build Back Better, whatever.
[01:25:57.333 --> 01:26:00.656]  Or, I mean, what do you think is really driving all of this?
[01:26:00.796 --> 01:26:03.579]  Let's assume they're lying because that's all they've done.
[01:26:03.639 --> 01:26:05.300]  So, what do you think is really driving this?
[01:26:06.041 --> 01:26:09.304]  I got a 30 second little pithy response and I'll let Dr. Meehan break it down, but this is big.
[01:26:09.884 --> 01:26:21.595]  Michael Jordan got to a point of his game, at the peak of his game, where he was so confident that he would actually tell people, and it's all documented, he'll tell someone, I'm going to shoot the next free throw with my eyes closed.
[01:26:22.299 --> 01:26:23.960]  I am going to drive left on you.
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:25.481]  I will now drive right on you.
[01:26:25.961 --> 01:26:33.686]  And he was so confident in his game that he felt like he could just tell you what he was going to do and could impose his will upon you.
[01:26:34.146 --> 01:26:36.207]  Ray Lewis was like that as a linebacker.
[01:26:36.867 --> 01:26:38.688]  Tom Brady, to a certain extent, was like that.
[01:26:38.728 --> 01:26:41.990]  There's a certain level of confidence people have, okay?
[01:26:42.331 --> 01:26:43.951]  So that would be on the emotional level.
[01:26:44.012 --> 01:26:46.413]  The second is, there's a guy by the name of Robin Bullock.
[01:26:46.793 --> 01:26:50.155]  He's one of the few prophets that I know willing to call out Yuval Noah Harari.
[01:26:50.395 --> 01:26:54.498]  He's a pastor who openly speaks about Yuval Noah Harari, Klaus Schwab, CERN.
[01:26:54.518 --> 01:26:56.119]  He might be a great guest for your show at some point.
[01:26:56.419 --> 01:27:02.604]  But he actually talks about how in the satanic realm, the year 2022 is like their Super Bowl.
[01:27:02.784 --> 01:27:05.065]  This is the year they've been planning on, pushing on.
[01:27:05.345 --> 01:27:09.248]  They want to implement the implementation of the Great Reset now.
[01:27:09.548 --> 01:27:11.930]  They want to implement the dark side.
[01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:15.272]  They call it dark side or dark seed if you read the Jack Kirby comic series.
[01:27:15.552 --> 01:27:17.013]  But this was a plan launched in 1971.
[01:27:17.254 --> 01:27:19.876]  The World Economic Forum was founded in 1971.
[01:27:20.677 --> 01:27:22.598]  We got off the gold standard in 1971.
[01:27:22.938 --> 01:27:25.160]  Both things happened per the recommendation of Henry Kissinger.
[01:27:25.401 --> 01:27:28.844]  They launched a 50-year plan, and their Super Bowl is right now.
[01:27:28.884 --> 01:27:30.265]  But Dr. Meehan, I'd love to get your thoughts.
[01:27:30.325 --> 01:27:32.046]  Yeah, well, my thoughts are they're not confident.
[01:27:32.066 --> 01:27:33.948]  They're just Machiavellian sociopaths.
[01:27:34.848 --> 01:27:39.469]  No, they are determined to get this mass surveillance system in place.
[01:27:39.509 --> 01:27:41.390]  This is another reason to fearmonger.
[01:27:41.670 --> 01:27:51.232]  This is another example of just waves of fearmongering to control the population, to terrorize them into a place of isolation again.
[01:27:51.532 --> 01:27:54.853]  They're re-implementing the mask mandates, all the things that didn't work before.
[01:27:55.133 --> 01:27:59.614]  They're going to try to foist upon us again, and they're consolidating power.
[01:28:00.194 --> 01:28:01.014]  Waves of fear.
[01:28:01.394 --> 01:28:02.375]  This is a distraction.
[01:28:02.435 --> 01:28:06.956]  I'm worried about what comes next, and I think what comes next will hit us in September or October.
[01:28:07.276 --> 01:28:11.777]  It'll be another weaponized virus, and here it comes again.
[01:28:12.118 --> 01:28:13.758]  But it's all about this mass surveillance.
[01:28:13.798 --> 01:28:23.381]  What they need is the tech to connect us to the hive mind, to know where we are, what we're doing, and be able to control the population from that standpoint.
[01:28:23.641 --> 01:28:27.062]  This is just another way to drive into that endgame for them.
[01:28:27.222 --> 01:28:29.183]  And back to that hive mind thing briefly here.
[01:28:29.623 --> 01:28:30.683]  You've all know Hararhi.
[01:28:30.723 --> 01:28:32.583]  He said this out loud during an interview.
[01:28:32.623 --> 01:28:34.244]  They said, what's COVID-19 really all about?
[01:28:34.264 --> 01:28:35.224]  And he said this out loud.
[01:28:36.084 --> 01:28:54.929]  The COVID-19 crisis could be a really watershed moment, a moment of significant change in the history of surveillance, because surveillance is being revolutionized, transformed from over the skin surveillance to under the skin surveillance.
[01:28:55.429 --> 01:28:58.471]  And let's just go to break like this and you guys take over.
[01:28:58.571 --> 01:29:02.754]  First, they have to convince you you have a virus and must be controlled.
[01:29:03.295 --> 01:29:07.838]  Then they'll convince you you are the virus and must be controlled and eradicated.
[01:29:07.878 --> 01:29:08.818]  That's the process we're in.
[01:29:08.677 --> 01:29:10.917]  Clay Clark, Dr. Jim Meehan, you guys take over.
[01:29:10.917 --> 01:29:23.478]   I want to take a minute out to address the viewers and listeners of InfoWars and to remind
[01:29:23.478 --> 01:29:29.318]   you that we've been vindicated and that world government and its tyrannical aim of depopulation
[01:29:29.318 --> 01:29:31.077]  is now out in the open.
[01:29:31.009 --> 01:29:37.071]  Everything you and I have done together has been historic and we cannot continue in this fight without your support.
[01:29:37.931 --> 01:29:47.512]   I want to encourage you all to be part of history right now while you still can to get the third and final coin in the Founding Member Coin Series Come and take it.
[01:29:47.633 --> 01:29:52.035]  Free men bear arms coins at 1776coin.com.
[01:29:52.496 --> 01:29:55.237]  In just a few days, this coin will be gone forever.
[01:29:56.258 --> 01:30:04.323]  And you will have the coin in your possession and know you helped InfoWars stay on air at the most critical time in our 28 year history.
[01:30:04.855 --> 01:30:06.156]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:30:06.176 --> 01:30:14.661]  I want to encourage you all to be part of history and to get this historic memento that keeps us on air at infoworkstore.com or 1776coin.com while you still can.
[01:30:18.251 --> 01:30:21.372]  All right, Alex Jones fans, I am not Alex Jones.
[01:30:21.512 --> 01:30:24.053]  I've been working on a pretty good Alex Jones impersonation, though.
[01:30:24.493 --> 01:30:27.374]  So, Dr. Jim Meehan, are you ready to be on the Alex Jones Show?
[01:30:27.414 --> 01:30:28.314]  Yes, I am, Alex.
[01:30:28.494 --> 01:30:30.695]  Okay, so I'm excited to be filling in for Alex Jones.
[01:30:30.715 --> 01:30:35.656]  What I'm going to try to do today, I can't fill the shoes of the great Alex Jones, but what I can do is drop some knowledge bombs.
[01:30:35.676 --> 01:30:38.877]  So I'm going to drop 17 knowledge bombs in 60 minutes.
[01:30:38.897 --> 01:30:40.318]  So knowledge bomb number one, Dr. Meehan.
[01:30:40.698 --> 01:31:01.468]  When people go to time2freeamerica.com, time2freeamerica.com, and they click on the monkeypox button, the monkey face button, they can read a document produced by the Nuclear Threat Initiative that prophesied that there would be a, or guessed, or predicted, there would be a monkeypox outbreak beginning in May of 2022, and then on June 5th of 2022, there would become an all-out outbreak.
[01:31:01.728 --> 01:31:02.708]  What are your thoughts on that, Doctor?
[01:31:02.728 --> 01:31:09.013]   Well, I mean, again, we've got the They're game plan is right there in print and they're right on script.
[01:31:09.294 --> 01:31:16.740]  This is the same kind of thing we've seen from Blockstep from 2010 and the Johns Hopkins collaborative that was going on there.
[01:31:17.021 --> 01:31:19.142]  They've been planning this all out ahead of time.
[01:31:19.443 --> 01:31:22.766]  Read it, see that they're working from a script once again.
[01:31:22.926 --> 01:31:23.926]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[01:31:23.926 --> 01:31:26.325]  Now, knowledge bond number two here.
[01:31:26.325 --> 01:31:27.326]  I want to play this clip here.
[01:31:27.326 --> 01:31:29.326]  This comes from Dr. Michael Ryan.
[01:31:29.326 --> 01:31:33.926]   Dr. Michael Ryan is a top advisor at the World Health Organization, and Tedros asked him
[01:31:33.926 --> 01:31:36.566]  to get behind the mic to discuss monkeypox.
[01:31:36.566 --> 01:31:40.046]   So Tedros says, "Dr. Michael Ryan would not discuss the monkeypox."
[01:31:40.046 --> 01:31:41.046]  And this is what he said out loud.
[01:31:41.046 --> 01:31:44.166]  Dr. Michael Ryan, here, listen to this.
[01:31:44.166 --> 01:31:50.006]   And there is no question of any loss of sovereignty or any play by global powers to take over
[01:31:50.510 --> 01:31:51.871]  This is not what this is about.
[01:31:52.291 --> 01:31:57.394]  This is about finding the necessary level of agreement to protect all of our communities in the future.
[01:31:57.855 --> 01:31:59.896]  How do you even process what he just said?
[01:32:00.256 --> 01:32:03.799]  I'm looking at the micro facial expressions and this guy is uncomfortable.
[01:32:04.039 --> 01:32:05.700]  He knows what he's saying is not the truth.
[01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:07.101]  He's leading with the truth.
[01:32:07.541 --> 01:32:12.420]   He's just trying to position in an oppositional way, this is not about stealing your sovereignty.
[01:32:12.420 --> 01:32:16.661]   No, this is about stealing the sovereignty of other countries.
[01:32:16.661 --> 01:32:22.820]   And thank God that even though our government capitulated, that Africa and so many other
[01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:25.260]  countries stood their ground.
[01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:29.420]   Freedom is still out there in the world and it's the third world that's defending it now.
[01:32:29.420 --> 01:32:33.220]   Now, many people reach out to your website, MeehanMD all the time.
[01:32:33.276 --> 01:32:36.437]  MeehanMD, M-E-E-H-A-N-M-D dot com.
[01:32:36.717 --> 01:32:42.898]  And how you and I really got connected is, you know, I told all our listeners, listen, the models that said the 2.2 million Americans would die from COVID, those were false.
[01:32:43.238 --> 01:32:45.059]  The PCR tests are falsely calibrated.
[01:32:45.379 --> 01:32:48.919]  COVID-19 is 100% treatable using butesonide, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine.
[01:32:49.199 --> 01:32:51.420]  And our listeners would say, that's great!
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.222]  But I can't find a doctor willing to actually treat me!
[01:32:54.502 --> 01:33:03.070]  So I would refer them to MeehanMD, and I encourage everyone to put that website into your phone right now, because with the monkeypox outbreak, they're gonna hype it up, I get it.
[01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:14.079]  But if you're looking for a doctor, you don't want to go to a doctor that's gonna force you to take a monkeypox vaccine, God knows what's in it, or to take an RNA-modifying nanotechnology COVID-19 vaccine just to see a doctor.
[01:33:14.099 --> 01:33:15.540]  So you want to put that in your phone.
[01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:16.741]  It's MeehanMD.com.
[01:33:16.961 --> 01:33:18.723]  How many COVID patients did you actually treat?
[01:33:18.843 --> 01:33:19.784]  Yeah, over 10,000.
[01:33:20.264 --> 01:33:22.165]  Many of those in the hospital too, by the way.
[01:33:22.465 --> 01:33:23.186]  How many were dying?
[01:33:23.226 --> 01:33:24.687]  Like 80% of them?
[01:33:24.867 --> 01:33:30.811]  None of our patients died, especially when you treat early or you treat with the right integrated approach.
[01:33:31.051 --> 01:33:35.073]  You know, ivermectin was a game changer in this pandemic.
[01:33:35.373 --> 01:33:39.856]  They've tried to dismiss it, discredit it, but it's very effective and about 300 studies say so.
[01:33:41.795 --> 01:33:44.417]  Now, I encourage everybody here to go look at the following thing.
[01:33:44.537 --> 01:33:47.700]  Go to your Google or DuckDuckGo and type in CDC Green Zone.
[01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:50.522]  The CDC is recommending now Green Zones.
[01:33:50.582 --> 01:33:53.345]  The Centers for Disease Control is recommending Green Zones.
[01:33:53.405 --> 01:33:55.266]  It's the implementation of a Nazi-style quarantine.
[01:33:55.286 --> 01:33:56.127]  What are your thoughts on that?
[01:33:56.347 --> 01:33:57.128]  Well, yeah.
[01:33:57.548 --> 01:33:59.490]  You've been talking about this for a long time, Clay.
[01:33:59.510 --> 01:34:00.591]  That's what brought us together.
[01:34:00.631 --> 01:34:01.732]  We're both truth-tellers.
[01:34:02.092 --> 01:34:05.274]  We go out and we find the evidence and we present it to the rest of the world.
[01:34:05.635 --> 01:34:07.056]  They want to quarantine us.
[01:34:07.376 --> 01:34:10.697]  They want to lock us down into these little, you know, Australia did it.
[01:34:10.778 --> 01:34:15.139]  If you think that this is, you know, this is unbelievable, you got to believe it.
[01:34:15.279 --> 01:34:16.360]  That's what they want to do.
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:17.860]  Australia did it.
[01:34:18.161 --> 01:34:20.542]  The CDC has had these plans for a long time.
[01:34:20.782 --> 01:34:24.603]  Now as we head into the break, I want to give people a bunch of free things, a bunch of free tools here, okay?
[01:34:24.983 --> 01:34:26.524]  So call to action number one during the break.
[01:34:26.564 --> 01:34:33.387]  I encourage you to go to time2freeamerica.com and you can download my e-book for free called The Great Reset vs. The Great Reawakening.
[01:34:33.567 --> 01:34:34.748]  If you want to buy it, you can.
[01:34:34.768 --> 01:34:36.991]  You can buy it in our shopping cart at TimeToFreeAmerica.com.
[01:34:37.231 --> 01:34:41.675]  But if not, you can download it for free, and it will walk you through the timeline of what's happening.
[01:34:42.156 --> 01:34:47.101]  Tool number two, I encourage you, we have a documentary called The Great Reawakening Documentary, and you can watch this.
[01:34:47.141 --> 01:34:49.343]  It features General Flynn, Mike Lindell, etc.
[01:34:49.623 --> 01:34:53.287]  You can get this 100% free by just going to TimeToFreeAmerica.com.
[01:34:53.307 --> 01:34:56.310]  You click on the shopping button and you can watch the documentary for free.
[01:34:56.670 --> 01:34:59.655]  And three, I encourage you to sign up for Dr. Jim Meehan's newsletter.
[01:34:59.695 --> 01:35:03.942]  It's a powerful newsletter, and you need to get the truth from a doctor you can trust.
[01:35:04.002 --> 01:35:09.270]  You do not need to be listening to the mainstream media, because they are going to try to scare you into believing that monkeypox is the most dangerous thing ever.
[01:35:09.531 --> 01:35:09.891]  Stay tuned.
[01:35:09.911 --> 01:35:10.733]  We'll be back after the break.
[01:35:11.671 --> 01:35:13.493]  All right, we're back here with Dr. Jim Meehan.
[01:35:13.513 --> 01:35:14.393]  My name is Clay Clark.
[01:35:14.453 --> 01:35:31.085]  I'm the host of the Reawaken America Tour featuring General Flynn, Donald J. Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Dr. Tenpenny, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Jim Brewer, Mike Lindell, Dr. Stella Emanuel, Peter McCullough, Dr. Judy Mikovits, I believe Charlie Kirk is going to be joining us on Future Stops.
[01:35:31.125 --> 01:35:31.846]  He's already been to one.
[01:35:32.146 --> 01:35:33.267]  Dr. Dave Martin and Alex!
[01:35:33.387 --> 01:35:39.909]  Alex Jones has been on the Reawaken America Tour, and we are here today to drop 17 knowledge bombs you won't hear anywhere else.
[01:35:40.249 --> 01:35:42.810]  Knowledge bomb number one, it's called the Nuclear Threat Initiative.
[01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:44.211]  Go to Timetofreeamerica.com.
[01:35:44.631 --> 01:35:50.653]  Everybody go to Timetofreeamerica.com, and you will find a document there called the Nuclear Threat Initiative.
[01:35:51.213 --> 01:36:02.239]   If you just go to Timetofreeamerica.com, click on the monkey face button, there you're going to see A document created by the Nuclear Threat Initiative that predicted a monkeypox outbreak beginning on May 15th of 2022.
[01:36:03.971 --> 01:36:14.134]  Dr. Meehan, that seems like a pretty specific guess to say that there would be an outbreak, one, two, that would happen on May 15th, and then three, that it would be called Monkeypox.
[01:36:14.174 --> 01:36:29.478]  This was written 15 months before the outbreak began, and the media right now, if we go to Google, or if we go to Google and we type in Monkeypox, and we click on News, right now the media is trying to convince you that Monkeypox is the most scary pandemic of all time.
[01:36:29.858 --> 01:36:30.378]  What are your thoughts?
[01:36:30.698 --> 01:36:34.221]  Well, number one, it's monkeypox is not a scary virus.
[01:36:34.661 --> 01:36:36.843]  There's 550 cases worldwide.
[01:36:37.163 --> 01:36:39.065]  Some of those in places that are not endemic.
[01:36:39.105 --> 01:36:44.809]  We know that the origin of that was from an international homosexual sex party thing that went on.
[01:36:44.849 --> 01:36:45.830]  So I would avoid those.
[01:36:45.870 --> 01:36:47.071]  That's the most important thing.
[01:36:47.351 --> 01:36:47.952]  Avoid those.
[01:36:48.232 --> 01:36:52.996]  Do not, you know, rub up against or have sex with somebody that has pustule filled lesions.
[01:36:53.056 --> 01:36:55.958]  I think that should be taught to all of our children in our homes.
[01:36:56.358 --> 01:37:01.983]   But that's, this is a large It's a DNA virus that does not spread easily.
[01:37:02.003 --> 01:37:03.525]  It is not aerosolizable.
[01:37:03.805 --> 01:37:06.448]  This is a, uh, but now, I have a concern.
[01:37:06.508 --> 01:37:17.218]  I have a concern that the people that are going to be most susceptible to a virus like monkeypox, which will, most people over the age of 50 have been vaccinated for smallpox, and they will not be susceptible to monkeypox.
[01:37:17.238 --> 01:37:21.222]  You still have lifelong immunity from that smallpox vaccine.
[01:37:21.682 --> 01:37:26.024]  But the people that are susceptible are people that receive the COVID-19 vaccines, Clay.
[01:37:26.424 --> 01:37:30.806]  The COVID-19 vaccines are causing mass immune suppression in the population.
[01:37:31.226 --> 01:37:35.788]  Those people are susceptible to every virus on the planet right now.
[01:37:36.128 --> 01:37:42.511]  They're in a very difficult phase of vaccine injury that is not being talked enough about.
[01:37:42.831 --> 01:37:45.413]  Certainly it's killing tens of thousands of people.
[01:37:45.593 --> 01:37:50.176]  VAERS, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, is full of vaccine deaths.
[01:37:50.196 --> 01:37:51.897]  They're trying to deny every one of those.
[01:37:52.257 --> 01:37:55.059]  That is a federally mandated, legislated felonious.
[01:37:55.379 --> 01:37:57.680]  You get a felony if you misreport into that thing.
[01:37:57.700 --> 01:38:04.419]   84% of the reports and VAERS are from Physicians and healthcare workers.
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:06.702]  So it's the most reliable database we have.
[01:38:06.742 --> 01:38:09.364]  There's over 28,000 deaths in that database right now.
[01:38:09.544 --> 01:38:16.731]  So right now, if you're listening right now, again, knowledge bomb number one, just ask yourself the question, why was this document created by the Nuclear Threat Initiative?
[01:38:17.131 --> 01:38:18.032]  Please don't believe me.
[01:38:18.092 --> 01:38:20.555]  Download it yourself by going to time2freeamerica.com.
[01:38:20.575 --> 01:38:21.355]  Click on the monkey pox button.
[01:38:23.297 --> 01:38:32.987]  Why did Dr. Michael Ryan of the World Health Organization say during the press conference that the monkeypox recommended protocol is not about taking over the world?
[01:38:33.207 --> 01:38:34.248]  That's the World Health Organization.
[01:38:34.528 --> 01:38:36.931]  Why did he say out loud that this is not about taking over the world?
[01:38:36.971 --> 01:38:39.353]  If you missed that clip, folks, let me play it for you real quick.
[01:38:39.373 --> 01:38:42.656]  Again, this is Dr. Michael Ryan of the World Health Organization.
[01:38:42.696 --> 01:38:53.637]   He's saying out loud At a press conference that occurred there at the World Health Organization on June 1st, that the attempt to stop the monkeypox outbreak is not about taking over the world.
[01:38:53.657 --> 01:38:54.058]  Listen to this.
[01:38:55.868 --> 01:39:02.191]  And there is no question of any loss of sovereignty or any play by global powers to take over the world.
[01:39:02.211 --> 01:39:03.472]  This is not what this is about.
[01:39:03.512 --> 01:39:05.053]  Okay, well, it's interesting he would say that.
[01:39:05.093 --> 01:39:06.333]  Okay, knowledge bomb number three.
[01:39:06.674 --> 01:39:09.695]  Why does the CDC recommend Nazi-style green zones?
[01:39:09.735 --> 01:39:17.419]  If you haven't seen it, folks, go to Google or DuckDuckGo, type in CDC green zones and read it yourself that there's Nazi-style quarantine camps.
[01:39:17.779 --> 01:39:19.180]  Knowledge bomb number four.
[01:39:19.944 --> 01:39:25.585]  Klaus Schwab and Yuval Noah Harari are obsessed with putting surveillance under your skin.
[01:39:25.605 --> 01:39:27.266]  They're actually now saying it out loud.
[01:39:27.686 --> 01:39:33.067]  Listen to the audio of Yuval Noah Harari, the lead advisor for Klaus Schwab.
[01:39:33.287 --> 01:39:38.468]  This is a man praised by Obama, Zuckerberg, Gates, MIT, Stanford, Harvard.
[01:39:38.548 --> 01:39:39.449]  They love this guy.
[01:39:39.509 --> 01:39:42.609]  He is their guru.
[01:39:42.629 --> 01:39:43.710]  They even call him the prophet.
[01:39:43.750 --> 01:39:45.030]  Listen to Yuval Noah Harari.
[01:39:46.628 --> 01:40:05.518]  The COVID-19 crisis could be a really watershed moment, a moment of significant change in the history of surveillance, because surveillance is being revolutionized, transformed from over-the-skin surveillance to under-the-skin surveillance.
[01:40:06.078 --> 01:40:14.923]  Previously, governments were collecting data about what we do, who we meet, where we go, what we watch on television.
[01:40:15.975 --> 01:40:21.936]  Now, with this epidemic, they increasingly focus on what's happening inside our body.
[01:40:22.884 --> 01:40:27.045]  What's our blood pressure, our body temperature, our heart rate?
[01:40:27.605 --> 01:40:31.987]  Now, this can be used, of course, to identify... Okay, so let's just be real about this, okay, folks?
[01:40:32.007 --> 01:40:33.127]  I'm gonna hold the book cover up.
[01:40:33.167 --> 01:40:36.928]  COVID-19 stands for Certificate of Vaccination, I.D.A.I.
[01:40:37.008 --> 01:40:39.949]  Klaus Schwab wrote this book, it's called COVID-19, The Great Reset.
[01:40:40.429 --> 01:40:49.372]  COVID-19, The Great Reset, is all about putting RNA-modifying nanotechnology inside the human body, but more importantly, it's about a Certificate of Vaccination, I.D.A.I.
[01:40:49.652 --> 01:40:52.033]  So I encourage everybody right now, we have to pick a side.
[01:40:52.759 --> 01:41:02.290]  You need, I encourage everybody right now, this is why this is so vitally important that you show up at one of these Reawaken America Tour events, regardless of where in the country you are, okay?
[01:41:02.310 --> 01:41:03.311]  The next one's in Virginia.
[01:41:03.812 --> 01:41:06.495]  And people always ask me, you know, why are you doing these events?
[01:41:06.555 --> 01:41:09.618]  Or they'll say, how much does Dr. Jim Behan get paid to speak?
[01:41:09.899 --> 01:41:11.420]  He doesn't take a speaking fee!
[01:41:11.701 --> 01:41:12.802]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny...
[01:41:16.678 --> 01:41:19.939]  Speaking of which, why are these people coming to these events to share the truth?
[01:41:19.959 --> 01:41:20.540]  I'll tell you why.
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:24.281]  It's because it's the Great Reawakening versus the Great Reset.
[01:41:24.521 --> 01:41:29.223]  And if you go to time2freeamerica.com, we have 997 tickets remaining right now for Virginia Beach.
[01:41:29.243 --> 01:41:34.486]  And people keep asking me, are you still going to do the Reawaken America Tour despite the monkeypox outbreak?
[01:41:34.986 --> 01:41:36.026]  Absolutely we're going to do it!
[01:41:36.206 --> 01:41:42.610]   In fact, that's why we're doing The Reawaken America Tour is to wake people up to the deception and the Great Reset Agenda.
[01:41:43.010 --> 01:41:44.972]  Next question I have for you, Knowledge Bomb No.
[01:41:44.992 --> 01:41:44.972]  5.
[01:41:45.312 --> 01:41:47.773]  Why is Congress working on legislation called H.R.
[01:41:49.054 --> 01:41:50.575]  666 and H.R.
[01:41:51.416 --> 01:41:50.575]  6666?
[01:41:51.536 --> 01:41:53.697]  If we can pull up on the screen, it's H.R.
[01:41:53.717 --> 01:41:53.697]  6666.
[01:41:54.197 --> 01:41:56.599]  This is four sixes.
[01:41:57.479 --> 01:41:58.540]  Four sixes right now.
[01:41:59.140 --> 01:42:01.262]  And meanwhile, read this legislation, folks.
[01:42:01.282 --> 01:42:03.283]  Just go to Google or DuckDuckGo, type in H.R.
[01:42:03.303 --> 01:42:03.283]  6666.
[01:42:03.723 --> 01:42:05.785]  I'm going to read it to you.
[01:42:07.082 --> 01:42:22.671]  To authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID-19 and activities such as contact tracing through mobile health units as necessary at individuals' residences and for other purposes.
[01:42:23.111 --> 01:42:28.274]  Meanwhile, Dr. Meehan, the German panel, a German panel right now, just met, this just came out at 9.27 a.m.
[01:42:28.294 --> 01:42:28.434]  today.
[01:42:30.299 --> 01:42:38.506]  Germany's independent vaccine advisory panel is recommending that shots against monkeypox be prioritized for people recently exposed?
[01:42:39.156 --> 01:42:44.139]  Well, number one, I'm very concerned about vaccinating in the midst of a widespread virus, especially with a live virus vaccine.
[01:42:43.958 --> 01:42:47.259]   might not be able to go around others unless you've been vaccinated.
[01:42:47.259 --> 01:42:48.797]  Dr. Mehan, what are your thoughts?
[01:42:48.797 --> 01:42:56.099]   Well, number one, I'm very concerned about vaccinating in the midst of a widespread virus,
[01:42:56.099 --> 01:42:57.918]  especially with a live virus vaccine.
[01:42:57.918 --> 01:43:02.759]   So everybody needs to understand that the smallpox and the vaccines are live viruses.
[01:43:02.849 --> 01:43:19.544]  There is a thing called recombination rescue in which a wild type virus and interfacing with an attenuated virus can rescue and eliminate the attenuation can cause a recombination that can create a new infectious version of that virus.
[01:43:19.884 --> 01:43:24.123]   We could create in the midst of vaccinating, in the midst of a pandemic,
[01:43:24.123 --> 01:43:28.844]   if such a thing with monkeypox were to occur, we could create greater problems.
[01:43:28.844 --> 01:43:33.844]   I will, you know, this is opinion, but I will, my opinion is that we have been creating
[01:43:33.844 --> 01:43:41.524]   the childhood hepatitis problem has been created because the Oxford and the Johnson & Johnson vaccines,
[01:43:41.524 --> 01:43:48.003]   using that adenovirus vector, and adenoviruses are broad in the population.
[01:43:48.012 --> 01:43:49.534]  Wild-type adenovirus.
[01:43:50.074 --> 01:43:56.641]  You vaccinate somebody with J&J or the Oxford adenovirus vaccine, they encounter the wild-type virus.
[01:43:56.961 --> 01:44:03.728]  Those two viruses can exchange pieces, parts, and create functionality that was not there before.
[01:44:04.228 --> 01:44:09.471]  So that's not being talked enough about, but it's being talked about.
[01:44:09.491 --> 01:44:11.072]  You're just not hearing enough about this.
[01:44:11.453 --> 01:44:13.074]  So we have a real concern here.
[01:44:13.774 --> 01:44:18.777]  I think that everything that they've been doing throughout the pandemic has no basis in science.
[01:44:19.137 --> 01:44:20.798]  It's creating more harm than good.
[01:44:21.178 --> 01:44:30.784]  That's my central concern about vaccinating more smallpox vaccinations in the midst of an active viral spread in some populations.
[01:44:31.144 --> 01:44:38.055]   We may create another nightmarish you know, chimera virus that kind of brings smallpox back
[01:44:38.055 --> 01:44:39.125]  into the population.
[01:44:39.125 --> 01:44:44.166]   I encourage everybody here during the break, I encourage you to go up right now to Band.Video,
[01:44:44.166 --> 01:44:46.166]  Band.Video and buy anything.
[01:44:46.166 --> 01:44:49.765]   Alex Jones has been in the fight, in the trenches for a long, long time.
[01:44:49.765 --> 01:44:51.765]  I'm late to the party.
[01:44:50.987 --> 01:44:53.988]  I'm honored to be guest hosting, but go in there and just buy anything.
[01:44:54.288 --> 01:44:59.810]  I always tell people, what better time of the year to start your Christmas shopping than on June 9th at 1.15 p.m.?
[01:45:00.170 --> 01:45:02.531]  Buy anything from Alex Jones right now during the break.
[01:45:02.551 --> 01:45:03.851]  We'll come back after the break.
[01:45:04.011 --> 01:45:04.451]  Very proud.
[01:45:04.772 --> 01:45:06.852]  And we're filling in for the great Alex Jones!
[01:45:06.892 --> 01:45:07.732]  My name's Clay Clark.
[01:45:07.772 --> 01:45:09.413]  I'm joined here by Dr. Jim Meehan.
[01:45:09.973 --> 01:45:12.175]  Sarah Horvath and Carter Bledsoe.
[01:45:12.215 --> 01:45:20.621]  And what's happening is, during the break, so many people from the InfoWars Nation are reaching out to TimeToFreeAmerica.com to buy those final tickets for the Virginia Beach Reawaken America Tour.
[01:45:20.641 --> 01:45:27.426]  And so I wanted to address that and just kind of tell you who we have confirmed to speak at the Reawaken America Tour in Virginia Beach.
[01:45:27.446 --> 01:45:29.608]  So I'm going to pull up the final agenda.
[01:45:30.028 --> 01:45:32.950]  I have not shared this with anybody else yet on a show before.
[01:45:33.270 --> 01:45:34.971]  We have 84 confirmed speakers.
[01:45:35.052 --> 01:45:36.953]  Let me read you lineup for day one.
[01:45:37.597 --> 01:46:14.229]   Praise and worship by Sean Voigt, Aya Kelly sings the National Anthem, Pastor Greg Locke, Kash Patel, Ann VanderSteel, the great Dr. Zolinko, John Guandolo, Michael Proper, Prophet Manuel Johnson, Leon Benjamin, Rashid Buttar, Eric Trump, Thomas Rins, Steve Schultz, Kimberly Fletcher, Christy Hutcherson, Bianca Gracia, Cindy Chafian, Dr. Dave Martin, yep, that's Dave Martin from the Plandemic series, Steve Strang, Kim Clement, the late great prophet, his daughter, Donna Clement, Jimmy Levy and Hi-Rez, the hip-hop duo, Jim Brewer, the comedian, Donald J. Trump Jr.
[01:46:14.289 --> 01:46:37.744]   is in the house, Dr. Judy Mykovitz, Pastor Dave Scarlett, Kash Patel, Part 2, Pastor Phil Hotsentore, Sean Stone, you know Sean Stone, Oliver Stone, Oliver Stone's son, Mike Lindell, the Commander's Artist, Dr. Richard Bartlett, Mel K, Lance Wallnau, Aaron Olszewski, the whistleblowing nurse, Ian Smith, Pastor Mark Burns, Steve Maxwell, and General Michael Flynn, and that's just in day one, so if you want to get those tickets,
[01:46:38.064 --> 01:46:39.665]  You gotta go to TimeToFreeAmerica.com.
[01:46:39.685 --> 01:46:41.506]  We have 997 tickets remaining.
[01:46:41.806 --> 01:46:43.987]  And you just go to TimeToFreeAmerica.com and request those tickets.
[01:46:44.248 --> 01:46:48.370]  And if you use the promo code, INFOWARS, we get you free access to the meet and greet.
[01:46:48.870 --> 01:46:50.371]  Sarah, what kind of people are reaching out?
[01:46:50.411 --> 01:46:51.492]  Do we have psychopaths?
[01:46:51.512 --> 01:46:52.432]  Do we have sick freaks?
[01:46:52.733 --> 01:46:54.073]  What kind of people are reaching out for tickets?
[01:46:54.373 --> 01:46:57.115]  We have awesome American patriots ready to learn the truth.
[01:46:57.255 --> 01:46:58.556]  And how does the pricing structure work?
[01:46:58.576 --> 01:46:59.376]  Because people want to know.
[01:46:59.416 --> 01:47:01.678]  We get attacked by the mainstream media.
[01:47:01.998 --> 01:47:03.739]  We let people name their price, but how does it work?
[01:47:04.449 --> 01:47:06.273]  Well, we've got lots of different options for them.
[01:47:06.353 --> 01:47:08.717]  So we've got our VIP, where you sit down front, that's $500.
[01:47:08.797 --> 01:47:13.546]  We've got general admission for $250, and then our scholarships are truly name your price.
[01:47:13.767 --> 01:47:16.933]  So if I want to sit in the general admission section, what's the least amount of money I can pay?
[01:47:17.675 --> 01:47:19.776]  Well, the least amount that you want to pay.
[01:47:20.336 --> 01:47:22.156]  What's the least amount you've ever sold a ticket for?
[01:47:22.456 --> 01:47:23.076]  Six dollars.
[01:47:23.156 --> 01:47:23.857]  That's a good deal.
[01:47:23.897 --> 01:47:26.137]  Now, Carter Bledsoe, you're talking to people around the clock.
[01:47:26.177 --> 01:47:27.157]  People are reaching out all the time.
[01:47:27.437 --> 01:47:30.918]  By the way, folks, if you want to get those tickets, again, go to TimeToFreeAmerica.com.
[01:47:31.278 --> 01:47:32.559]  TimeToFreeAmerica.com.
[01:47:32.619 --> 01:47:33.639]  Or you can text the number 918-851-0102.
[01:47:33.659 --> 01:47:33.939]  918-851-0102.
[01:47:33.759 --> 01:47:40.759]  918-851-0102. 918-851-0102. Again the number 918-851-0102.
[01:47:40.759 --> 01:47:42.358]  number 91885.
[01:47:42.281 --> 01:47:46.743]  You understand, President Trump has seven people close to him.
[01:47:46.763 --> 01:47:57.569]  He has his wife, Eric Trump, Donald J. Trump Jr., Kash Patel, he has a General Michael Flynn, he's got Peter Navarro, and these people have all basically been on the tour.
[01:47:57.749 --> 01:48:06.493]  So if you want to meet the people who are actually at the tip of the spear fighting with President Donald J. Trump for the very preservation of our freedoms throughout the world, you've got to go to TimeToFreeAmerica.com.
[01:48:06.853 --> 01:48:08.594]  Carter, how does the ticket pricing work?
[01:48:08.634 --> 01:48:09.795]  Somebody out there says, I don't get it.
[01:48:09.835 --> 01:48:10.255]  How does it work?
[01:48:10.922 --> 01:48:12.683]  Alright, so we have a couple different options.
[01:48:12.963 --> 01:48:19.427]  We have the VIP, which is going to get you the exclusive seating down front, along with a VIP shirt and a copy of Clay's latest book, Fair and Mass 2.0.
[01:48:20.448 --> 01:48:21.268]  Those are $500.
[01:48:22.129 --> 01:48:23.870]  We do have some promo codes, as you said before.
[01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:28.412]  We have general admission at $250, and then we have our scholarship tickets as well, so people can pay what they want.
[01:48:28.452 --> 01:48:30.414]  We want this information in the ears of everyone.
[01:48:30.534 --> 01:48:32.195]  What's the lowest you've sold a ticket for?
[01:48:32.255 --> 01:48:32.755]  Lowest price?
[01:48:34.176 --> 01:48:37.340]  I'll go with $6.50, so slightly higher than Sarah's price.
[01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:39.342]  Okay, so I want to make sure we get this to anybody.
[01:48:39.382 --> 01:48:40.343]  You can attend these events.
[01:48:40.383 --> 01:48:43.066]  My wife and I, we don't take any income or salary from these events.
[01:48:43.387 --> 01:48:44.969]  We just want to get the truth out there.
[01:48:45.229 --> 01:48:47.632]  So I encourage you folks, go to TimeToFreeAmerica.com.
[01:48:48.232 --> 01:48:51.413]  Virginia Beach, July 8th and 9th, 997 tickets remaining.
[01:48:51.773 --> 01:48:52.813]  New York, New York!
[01:48:52.853 --> 01:48:55.194]  We're going to Rochester, New York, folks, in August.
[01:48:55.514 --> 01:48:57.415]  We have just under 2,500 tickets remaining for that.
[01:48:57.755 --> 01:48:59.095]  And now back to the Knowledge Bombs.
[01:48:59.135 --> 01:49:00.996]  Thank you, Carter and Sarah, for joining us there.
[01:49:01.016 --> 01:49:02.956]  People had some questions, so back to the show.
[01:49:03.176 --> 01:49:03.556]  Here we go.
[01:49:03.816 --> 01:49:07.618]  Now, people want to know what's going on with the satanic agenda.
[01:49:07.858 --> 01:49:09.358]  What is going on with the satanic agenda?
[01:49:09.377 --> 01:49:13.676]   So I encourage everybody, go to Google right now and type in, into Google right now,
[01:49:13.676 --> 01:49:16.478]  type in Google Chrome logo 666.
[01:49:16.478 --> 01:49:20.077]  Again folks, type in Google Chrome logo 666.
[01:49:20.077 --> 01:49:21.917]  Now Dr. Meehan, I'm gonna pull it up for you.
[01:49:21.917 --> 01:49:23.877]  I'm gonna ask you the same question.
[01:49:23.877 --> 01:49:27.596]  Why does the Google Chrome logo have a 666?
[01:49:27.549 --> 01:49:28.129]  What's that all about?
[01:49:28.149 --> 01:49:28.710]  You're in your mind.
[01:49:28.770 --> 01:49:31.872]  Yeah, it's all about the symbolism of those that serve Satan.
[01:49:32.132 --> 01:49:34.714]  Why did they name their operating system Adreno?
[01:49:35.355 --> 01:49:35.895]  Adreno.
[01:49:36.015 --> 01:49:42.200]  So the Google Chrome browser has an operating system called Adreno Chrome.
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:44.462]  So you're saying there might be some symbolism there?
[01:49:45.122 --> 01:49:45.803]  There's got to be.
[01:49:45.863 --> 01:49:46.704]  You're seeing it all over.
[01:49:46.764 --> 01:49:49.646]  That's a compulsion of, you know, satanic cult members.
[01:49:50.566 --> 01:49:55.289]  Whatever tenants, I don't have any idea because I serve absolutely 100% the other side.
[01:49:55.369 --> 01:49:56.510]  I serve Christ.
[01:49:57.430 --> 01:49:59.891]  I serve the Lord and I will bow before no other.
[01:50:00.272 --> 01:50:07.696]  But this cult, this Luciferian cabal, they've got to compulsively demonstrate their allegiance to Satan.
[01:50:07.976 --> 01:50:10.477]  I think that's what that, you know, this is what this is all about.
[01:50:10.517 --> 01:50:12.198]  You see their symbolism everywhere.
[01:50:12.698 --> 01:50:13.519]  Okay.
[01:50:13.539 --> 01:50:14.540]  You cannot ignore it.
[01:50:14.820 --> 01:50:28.772]  Now the Nuclear Threat Initiative, the document that prophesied, this organization that prophesied the outbreak of monkeypox, they said the outbreak would really reach fever pitch starting June 5th and then moving into June 6th, which happens to be the day we memorialize D-Day.
[01:50:29.233 --> 01:50:30.013]  It also happens to be 666.
[01:50:31.535 --> 01:50:32.976]  Let's pull this up on the screen real quick.
[01:50:33.056 --> 01:50:36.079]  Congress again is working on legislation called HR 666.
[01:50:36.179 --> 01:50:36.259]  Yeah.
[01:50:38.147 --> 01:50:39.028]  It's called HR 666.
[01:50:40.109 --> 01:50:41.350]  The Google Chrome logo is 666.
[01:50:42.831 --> 01:50:43.371]  Next question.
[01:50:43.451 --> 01:50:46.234]  Why does the World Economic Forum's logo feature a 666?
[01:50:47.014 --> 01:50:47.695]  Let's look it up, folks.
[01:50:47.995 --> 01:50:48.776]  World Economic Forum.
[01:50:48.796 --> 01:50:50.377]  Everybody type it into Google or DuckDuckGo.
[01:50:50.697 --> 01:50:52.238]  World Economic Forum logo 666.
[01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:54.280]  Look at the logo.
[01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:55.101]  Stare at it.
[01:50:55.361 --> 01:50:55.881]  Let it happen.
[01:50:55.921 --> 01:50:58.904]  It's like one of those things back in the mall back in the day.
[01:50:58.924 --> 01:51:02.727]  You'd look at the painting, you'd look at the picture, and you look at it long enough you could eventually see something.
[01:51:03.007 --> 01:51:05.328]  I'm going to pull this up for you so you can see it.
[01:51:05.388 --> 01:51:09.750]  Why does the World Economic Forum have a logo with the three sixes right here?
[01:51:09.891 --> 01:51:10.771]  What's that all about?
[01:51:10.791 --> 01:51:12.692]  Yeah, it's all about that symbolism, Clay.
[01:51:13.272 --> 01:51:17.254]  And why is the guru, the prophet of this whole cabal?
[01:51:19.375 --> 01:51:24.917]  Talking about transhumanism, destroying God, men becoming like gods.
[01:51:26.157 --> 01:51:35.080]  If you can't see it, if you don't realize we're in the midst of a spiritual warfare, that it's time to choose a side, it is the battle between good and evil.
[01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:39.041]  Your head is in the sand and there's too many people that are like that.
[01:51:39.201 --> 01:51:46.745]  What I'm trying to do is give our listeners here on the Great Alex Jones Show the opportunity to give themselves, give tools to wake up their friends and family.
[01:51:46.765 --> 01:51:49.607]  My entire goal of today's show is how to wake up your friends and family, okay?
[01:51:49.947 --> 01:51:52.068]  We call it the Great Reawakening versus the Great Reset.
[01:51:52.108 --> 01:51:55.871]  We know they're a Luciferian plan, but I'm trying to give you tools to wake up your family and friends.
[01:51:56.211 --> 01:51:59.473]  Next thing you can show your family and friends, why does the CERN logo equal 666?
[01:52:00.655 --> 01:52:02.256]  The CERN logo is 666.
[01:52:02.897 --> 01:52:03.997]  Think about it for a second, folks.
[01:52:04.017 --> 01:52:05.398]  The world's largest supercomputer.
[01:52:05.418 --> 01:52:09.901]  You know, Elon Musk is teaming up to build the Hadron Colliders for the world's largest supercomputer.
[01:52:10.322 --> 01:52:12.443]  Elon Musk's company called the Boring Company.
[01:52:12.483 --> 01:52:14.784]  They're making these Hadron Colliders.
[01:52:14.804 --> 01:52:22.770]  You know, the Hadron Collider located on the CERN supercomputer is located on top of the former location of where the Apollo Temple was.
[01:52:23.110 --> 01:52:28.133]  You know, CERN, they had a grand opening celebrating one of the opening of one of their tunnels with a satanic ritual.
[01:52:28.414 --> 01:52:29.935]  Why is CERN's logo 666, Dr. Meehan?
[01:52:30.675 --> 01:52:34.337]  Yeah, once again, it's the alignment of all the Luciferian Cabal.
[01:52:34.357 --> 01:52:36.118]  They're all coming active at this time.
[01:52:36.178 --> 01:52:37.879]  This is an important time in history.
[01:52:38.759 --> 01:52:39.860]  Get on the side of God.
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:41.801]  Pray God into this world.
[01:52:41.841 --> 01:52:46.123]  Let's bring an end to this Luciferian Cabal and their rise to power.
[01:52:46.543 --> 01:52:56.054]  Now, Bill Gates has a patent he's been working on, or Microsoft has a patent, for a cryptocurrency system using body activity with a patent number WO202060606.
[01:52:56.094 --> 01:53:04.403]  Do you see any parallel between that, that cryptocurrency, and Revelation chapter 13, verses 16 through 18?
[01:53:04.603 --> 01:53:06.025]  I mean, you know, these people know this.
[01:53:06.505 --> 01:53:10.487]  I mean, I get uncomfortable if the, you know, the check charge is $6.66.
[01:53:10.747 --> 01:53:13.168]  I'll buy something else, you know.
[01:53:13.188 --> 01:53:14.268]  I'll get something else.
[01:53:14.628 --> 01:53:16.109]  I get so uncomfortable seeing that number.
[01:53:16.429 --> 01:53:24.493]  Why are, you know, our politicians, why are these corporations, you know, putting it out there up front right in your face to be seen?
[01:53:26.373 --> 01:53:30.456]   It's a dark signal that To whom they are allied.
[01:53:30.756 --> 01:53:31.857]  Let me just say this, folks.
[01:53:31.917 --> 01:53:41.385]  If you want to know what you can do to help save this nation, one, go to TimeToFreeAmerica.com, click on that monkey face button, the monkey box button, and download the document produced by the Nuclear Threat Initiative and share it with your family and friends.
[01:53:41.725 --> 01:53:43.246]  Two, go to MeehanMD.
[01:53:43.306 --> 01:53:44.027]  Put that in your phone.
[01:53:44.047 --> 01:53:48.070]  You want to find a doctor that you can trust, go to MeehanMD.com.
[01:53:48.090 --> 01:53:49.191]  We'll be back after the break.
[01:53:49.751 --> 01:53:50.492]  And we're back!
[01:53:50.512 --> 01:53:52.633]  Filling in for the incredible Alex Jones.
[01:53:52.653 --> 01:53:53.694]  My name is Clay Clark.
[01:53:53.734 --> 01:54:05.442]  I'm the host of the Reawaken America Tour with General Flynn, featuring Donald J. Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Dr. Tenpenny, Alex Jones, Owen Troyer, Dr. Jim Meehan, Dr. Zelenko.
[01:54:05.582 --> 01:54:07.043]  It is an incredible cast of people.
[01:54:07.063 --> 01:54:11.986]  I encourage everybody, Dr. Judy Mikevitz, just go to TimeToFreeAmerica.com.
[01:54:12.266 --> 01:54:19.251]  And you know how it is, when you get down to the final 900 tickets or so, because we're right now, the Reawaken America Tour that we're taking to Virginia Beach.
[01:54:19.771 --> 01:54:21.692]  People keep calling saying, are you still having it?
[01:54:21.732 --> 01:54:23.293]  You know with the monkeypox outbreak?
[01:54:23.633 --> 01:54:32.298]  We're now 30 days away from the Reawaken America Tour going to Virginia Beach and we're now down to our final 997 tickets and now somebody's requesting a ticket like every minute.
[01:54:32.599 --> 01:54:39.461]   The energy is unbelievable because what's happening is People know that this monkeypox pandemic is totally manufactured.
[01:54:39.741 --> 01:54:46.663]  They saw the COVID-19 epidemic, some people were tricked, some were deceived, but now people refuse to believe the deception.
[01:54:46.683 --> 01:54:52.024]  But I encourage everybody right now, wake up your family and friends, go to time2freeamerica.com right now.
[01:54:52.364 --> 01:55:12.592]   Go there, click on the monkeypox button, and you can download the document created by the Nuclear Threat Initiative, this organization heavily funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that actually prophesied the monkeypox outbreak beginning On May 15th of 2022, reaching full-scale outbreak on June 5th of 2022, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[01:55:12.612 --> 01:55:14.353]  They prophesied it 15 months ago.
[01:55:14.713 --> 01:55:15.874]  They're not holding anything back.
[01:55:16.014 --> 01:55:21.917]  Also, folks, let's go to TimeToFreeAmerica.com forward slash revelation for Knowledge Bomb number 11.
[01:55:22.437 --> 01:55:24.859]  TimeToFreeAmerica.com forward slash revelation.
[01:55:24.899 --> 01:55:25.119]  Here we go.
[01:55:26.013 --> 01:55:29.936]  You know, Revelation 13, 2, it's a controversial book called the Bible.
[01:55:30.017 --> 01:55:31.578]  Revelation's a book in the Bible there.
[01:55:31.918 --> 01:55:44.810]   Okay, and it says here, Revelation chapter 13, verse 2, it reads, And his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion, and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and his great authority.
[01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:46.011]  Revelation 13, 2.
[01:55:46.392 --> 01:55:48.193]  This was written by the Apostle John.
[01:55:48.253 --> 01:55:50.255]  He was exiled on the island of Patmos.
[01:55:50.335 --> 01:55:53.058]  Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ gave him an open vision.
[01:55:53.098 --> 01:55:53.999]  He wrote this down.
[01:55:54.459 --> 01:55:56.321]  Dr. Meehan, that is the exact...
[01:55:57.145 --> 01:56:06.915]  Physical description of the Guardian of Nations statue presented to the United Nations and put right in front of the United Nations building at 405 East 42nd Street, New York, New York.
[01:56:07.375 --> 01:56:07.916]  What are your thoughts?
[01:56:07.996 --> 01:56:11.419]  It can't get more overt than that.
[01:56:11.659 --> 01:56:15.823]  That they are right in your face, in the face of everybody that can see this thing.
[01:56:15.863 --> 01:56:17.445]  They are demonstrating their allegiance.
[01:56:17.925 --> 01:56:21.168]  You know, it's directly out of the Bible.
[01:56:21.208 --> 01:56:22.489]  They are manifesting the beast.
[01:56:22.529 --> 01:56:25.431]  They're using it as their symbolism, as more of their symbolism.
[01:56:25.711 --> 01:56:27.313]  You got so much of this everywhere.
[01:56:27.653 --> 01:56:36.540]  It's the mark of Machiavellian sociopaths, is the way I describe this, their ilk, is they are unafraid to be in your face with their Luciferian leanings.
[01:56:37.220 --> 01:56:39.559]  Yeah, look at it, see it, it's everywhere.
[01:56:39.559 --> 01:56:43.220]   For anybody out there right now, if you're, I keep a score, we're on knowledge bomb number
[01:56:43.220 --> 01:56:43.659]  12.
[01:56:43.659 --> 01:56:46.260]   Okay, I'm gonna try to get through 25 in one hour, see if we can do it here.
[01:56:46.260 --> 01:56:50.220]   Okay, the CEO of Nokia was speaking at the World Economic Forum and they asked him,
[01:56:50.220 --> 01:56:53.500]   "Sir, you're the head of Nokia, "what's the future of smartphones?"
[01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:59.539]   And he said this, this is Pekka Lundmark, the CEO of Nokia, listen to this, it's crazy.
[01:56:59.539 --> 01:57:04.418]   I wanted to ask when you all think we're gonna move from this form factor to something that's on your face,
[01:57:04.418 --> 01:57:07.380]  glasses and when computing's all on the edge.
[01:57:07.380 --> 01:57:09.939]  All right, 50 seconds, who wants to answer quickly?
[01:57:09.939 --> 01:57:13.699]  I think it will go, it will.
[01:57:13.645 --> 01:57:13.885]  It will.
[01:57:13.925 --> 01:57:15.306]  First of all, it will definitely happen.
[01:57:16.327 --> 01:57:20.390]  I was talking about 6G earlier, which is around 2030.
[01:57:20.851 --> 01:57:25.851]   I would say that by then, definitely the smartphone as we know it.
[01:57:25.851 --> 01:57:48.451]   There are many preconceived notions about what defines Satanism.
[01:57:48.487 --> 01:57:52.309]  Some people will say that Satanists are just playing dress-up.
[01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:54.931]  Some say they sacrifice children.
[01:57:55.311 --> 01:57:57.812]  And others believe they have magical powers.
[01:57:58.513 --> 01:58:00.374]  But the truth is much more simple.
[01:58:01.194 --> 01:58:05.575]  Most people will agree that Satanism is the antithesis of Christianity.
[01:58:06.116 --> 01:58:09.197]  So first we must define what Christianity is.
[01:58:09.697 --> 01:58:16.179]  In a sentence, Christianity is the impulse to express brotherly love towards our fellow man.
[01:58:17.499 --> 01:58:20.380]  Satanism does not have that impulse at all.
[01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:27.523]  In the most simple terms, Satanism can be described with the pop culture phrase, pimps and hoes.
[01:58:28.583 --> 01:58:30.784]  If these words upset you, good.
[01:58:31.484 --> 01:58:33.525]  We are talking about the nature of evil.
[01:58:34.305 --> 01:58:36.588]  And if it makes light of it, even better.
[01:58:37.088 --> 01:58:39.071]  These animals are nothing to fear.
[01:58:39.791 --> 01:58:47.320]  While the rich and powerful Satanists want you to believe they are witches and warlocks, they are nothing more than pimps and hoes.
[01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:51.845]  Cannibals, feeding off other people like predatory animals.
[01:58:52.265 --> 01:58:59.147]  Completely devoid of the impulse for brotherly love, Satanism is base-level animal tribalism.
[01:58:59.567 --> 01:59:07.809]  An animal hierarchy comprised of the pimps at the top, the hoes they control, and the tricks they both exploit.
[01:59:08.869 --> 01:59:12.270]  This is the law of the jungle which has existed for millennia.
[01:59:13.190 --> 01:59:19.612]  A survival of the fittest, dog-eat-dog world, where the nice guys always finish last.
[01:59:20.392 --> 01:59:32.516]  It is the patriarchy that the anti-Christians claim to oppose, which makes no sense, because we are only able to transcend this ruthlessness with the Christian impulse of brotherly love.
[01:59:33.403 --> 01:59:34.884]  We're back here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:34.904 --> 01:59:37.547]  My name is Clay Clark filling in for Alex Jones.
[01:59:37.567 --> 01:59:41.010]  Whether we're under a deep state attack or whether the Internet's just failing, I don't know, but let's go back.
[01:59:41.270 --> 01:59:46.034]  So why did the CEO of Nokia say that smartphones will be in your body, Dr. Meehan?
[01:59:46.134 --> 02:00:02.284]   Well, because that's, you know, if they can put it in your body, you know, and they can sell it on the basis that it's going to be such a convenience to you and you can communicate and access the Internet and all the things that you love to do much more efficiently, The slippery slope here, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:00:02.284 --> 02:00:04.884]  is it's a two-way communication.
[02:00:04.884 --> 02:00:07.484]  What you can send out, they can send in.
[02:00:07.484 --> 02:00:10.605]  And in so doing, they can control the electrom--
[02:00:10.605 --> 02:00:12.085]  you know, we're electrical beings.
[02:00:12.085 --> 02:00:13.804]  We can be managed.
[02:00:13.804 --> 02:00:14.724]  We can be controlled.
[02:00:14.724 --> 02:00:16.324]  We can be inflamed.
[02:00:16.324 --> 02:00:19.083]  We can be damaged by that two-way communication.
[02:00:19.083 --> 02:00:24.505]   And this is why you've been telling your patients for years, look at what's in these vaccines.
[02:00:24.505 --> 02:00:26.284]  Be very careful about these vaccines.
[02:00:26.284 --> 02:00:28.564]  Don't put them in your body.
[02:00:27.482 --> 02:00:35.504]  You're one of the first doctors in America to cry out to the world and let them know, don't put RNA modifying nanotechnology inside your body.
[02:00:35.524 --> 02:00:40.225]  And I'm telling you folks, if you get injured, you get sick, that's not when you want to be looking for a doctor.
[02:00:40.245 --> 02:00:45.246]  Because a lot of doctors right now are trying to get you to take a COVID-19 vaccine before they will see you.
[02:00:45.686 --> 02:00:47.967]  So what I sincerely mean is put this into your phone right now.
[02:00:48.288 --> 02:00:50.969]  Put Dr. Meehan, put his website into your phone right now.
[02:00:50.989 --> 02:00:55.171]  It's Meehan, M-E-E-H-A-N-M-D dot com, MeehanMD dot com.
[02:00:55.411 --> 02:00:58.093]  This next audio clip, this comes to us from Alibaba.
[02:00:58.553 --> 02:01:00.874]  There, the head of Alibaba, J. Michael Evans.
[02:01:00.955 --> 02:01:03.336]  He says this is J. Michael Evans of Alibaba.
[02:01:03.616 --> 02:01:06.758]  Listen to what he said the future will be like at the World Economic Forum.
[02:01:06.778 --> 02:01:07.558]  He said this out loud.
[02:01:07.998 --> 02:01:14.422]  We're developing new technology and ability for consumers to measure their own carbon footprint.
[02:01:15.839 --> 02:01:16.439]  What does that mean?
[02:01:16.900 --> 02:01:18.881]  That's... Where are they traveling?
[02:01:19.261 --> 02:01:20.322]  How are they traveling?
[02:01:20.662 --> 02:01:21.522]  What are they eating?
[02:01:22.123 --> 02:01:23.664]  What are they consuming on the platform?
[02:01:24.284 --> 02:01:27.526]  So, individual carbon footprint tracker.
[02:01:27.846 --> 02:01:28.506]  Unbelievable!
[02:01:28.526 --> 02:01:29.727]  They're saying this out loud!
[02:01:29.767 --> 02:01:34.110]  Now, this is why you have to support the program, the InfoWars program here on Alex Jones.
[02:01:34.690 --> 02:01:38.332]  I mean this, during the break, Alex has been putting out great content for years.
[02:01:38.372 --> 02:01:45.136]  You've got to go to the shopping cart during the break and buy something, anything at all, to support Alex and the entire team here, because this is what's happening.
[02:01:45.536 --> 02:01:46.577]  Fox News, okay?
[02:01:46.777 --> 02:01:51.841]  They were just covering the World Economic Forum and a lot of people said, oh wow, finally Fox is covering it!
[02:01:52.221 --> 02:01:54.543]  Listen to what Jesse Watters said.
[02:01:54.583 --> 02:01:56.884]  May God have mercy on his soul.
[02:01:57.245 --> 02:02:01.888]  Listen to what Jesse Watters said out loud when addressing the discussion of Bill Gates.
[02:02:01.928 --> 02:02:02.348]  Listen to this.
[02:02:03.249 --> 02:02:05.651]  And I don't want to put down Bill Gates and these guys.
[02:02:05.671 --> 02:02:07.112]  You know they do a lot for charity.
[02:02:08.503 --> 02:02:10.924]  And I don't want to put down Bill Gates and these guys.
[02:02:10.944 --> 02:02:12.345]  You know they do a lot for charity.
[02:02:12.405 --> 02:02:16.686]  If I had to describe Bill Gates, this is Bill Gates who has Dr. Anthony Fauci on his board.
[02:02:16.726 --> 02:02:20.828]  This is Bill Gates, the one with the patent W02020060606.
[02:02:20.908 --> 02:02:26.510]  If I had to describe Bill Gates, you know the one that made the models that said the 2.2 million Americans might die from COVID.
[02:02:26.730 --> 02:02:30.172]  If I had to describe Bill Gates, you know the guy pushing the RNA modifying nanotechnology.
[02:02:30.452 --> 02:02:37.855]  If I had to describe Bill Gates, the guy putting vaccines into children and maiming and killing them and making them sterile and infertile.
[02:02:38.215 --> 02:02:46.442]  I would describe him as a pathological liar, a psychopath, a depopulationist, a eugenics neo-nazi.
[02:02:46.722 --> 02:02:47.623]  He's the worst!
[02:02:47.943 --> 02:02:51.886]  And Jesse Waters, may God have mercy on your soul, listen to this again.
[02:02:51.906 --> 02:02:53.608]  That's why you have to listen to InfoWars.
[02:02:53.628 --> 02:02:55.929]  I'm telling you, you can't let this program get off the air.
[02:02:55.969 --> 02:02:56.410]  Listen to this.
[02:02:57.010 --> 02:02:59.172]  And I don't want to put down Bill Gates and these guys.
[02:02:59.192 --> 02:03:00.573]  You don't want to put down Bill Gates?
[02:03:00.753 --> 02:03:04.656]  That would be like me saying, and I don't want to put down Adolf Hitler.
[02:03:04.756 --> 02:03:06.337]  You know, he was a good speaker.
[02:03:06.397 --> 02:03:07.598]  Listen to this psychopath.
[02:03:07.698 --> 02:03:10.000]  And I don't want to put down Bill Gates and these guys.
[02:03:10.020 --> 02:03:12.562]  This would be like introducing Marx.
[02:03:12.622 --> 02:03:16.645]  So this would be introducing Stalin and say, I don't want to put down Joseph Stalin.
[02:03:16.685 --> 02:03:17.906]  Listen to this psychopath.
[02:03:18.910 --> 02:03:21.392]  And I don't want to put down Bill Gates and these guys.
[02:03:21.432 --> 02:03:23.213]  What are you talking about, Jesse Waters?
[02:03:23.253 --> 02:03:27.596]  How much money do you get paid to put RNA-modifying nanotechnology inside people?
[02:03:28.036 --> 02:03:28.757]  Holy crap!
[02:03:28.797 --> 02:03:30.318]  Buy something from Alex Jones during the break.
[02:03:30.358 --> 02:03:30.878]  We'll be back.
[02:03:31.278 --> 02:03:32.519]  And we are back right now.
[02:03:32.599 --> 02:03:35.081]  America is facing a war, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:03:35.101 --> 02:03:36.161]  It's a war on your freedoms.
[02:03:36.221 --> 02:03:38.403]  It's the Great Reawakening versus the Great Reset.
[02:03:38.823 --> 02:03:40.924]  But it's not a random series of events.
[02:03:40.984 --> 02:03:41.584]  No, it's not.
[02:03:41.624 --> 02:03:48.966]  If you go to time2freeamerica.com and you click on the monkey face button, you can look right now at the monkeypox outbreak for what it is, okay?
[02:03:48.986 --> 02:03:54.267]  The Nuclear Threat Initiative is an organization heavily funded by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.
[02:03:54.287 --> 02:03:55.367]  It was founded by Ted Turner.
[02:03:55.747 --> 02:04:04.309]  And this organization said 15 months ago that they guessed or prophesied or planned that there would be a monkeypox outbreak beginning on May 15th of 2022.
[02:04:07.188 --> 02:04:16.472]  Crescendoing into a full outbreak starting June 5th into June 6th, the celebration of or the memorialization of D-Day, which it happens also to be 666, okay?
[02:04:16.772 --> 02:04:20.634]  Now also, they bake out, they bake their plan into movies and films.
[02:04:21.508 --> 02:04:26.030]  So the X-Files, they put out a broadcast and I want everyone to look this up right now.
[02:04:26.050 --> 02:04:27.670]  So let's go to Rumble.com if we can.
[02:04:27.710 --> 02:04:30.411]  Rumble.com and search for the Thrive Time Show.
[02:04:30.431 --> 02:04:31.592]  That's where you can find our shows.
[02:04:31.912 --> 02:04:33.973]  You go to Rumble.com and search for the Thrive Time Show.
[02:04:33.993 --> 02:04:38.074]  I just put this out and it's called The Great Reset X-Files Season 10.
[02:04:38.554 --> 02:04:40.115]  Listen to the audio excerpt here.
[02:04:40.135 --> 02:04:41.476]  It is absolutely mind-boggling.
[02:04:41.496 --> 02:04:44.857]  This is the excerpt from the X-Files Season 10, 2016.
[02:04:46.237 --> 02:04:47.098]  Listen to what they said.
[02:04:47.138 --> 02:04:47.458]  Listen to this.
[02:04:47.478 --> 02:04:47.678]  Here we go.
[02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:50.541]  Tad O'Malley has been making claims.
[02:04:51.262 --> 02:04:51.922]  Claims about what?
[02:04:53.343 --> 02:04:57.705]  You and everyone you know has a piece of DNA in your genome put there without your knowing it.
[02:04:57.805 --> 02:04:58.545]  Put there by whom?
[02:04:59.066 --> 02:05:00.306]  Well, that's the question of the day.
[02:05:01.267 --> 02:05:02.407]  This is an internet lunatic.
[02:05:02.427 --> 02:05:03.788]  You're not saying you believe him.
[02:05:03.888 --> 02:05:05.189]  Hold on, Agent Einstein.
[02:05:05.209 --> 02:05:06.289]  You're talking to a scientist.
[02:05:06.810 --> 02:05:08.050]  Forgive me, Assistant Director.
[02:05:08.110 --> 02:05:11.552]  It may sound insensitive, but the suggestion is pure science fiction.
[02:05:11.692 --> 02:05:16.975]  What I'm saying, Agent Einstein, is that the facts, as I understand them, cannot be discounted out of hand.
[02:05:18.744 --> 02:05:21.847]  No one has the right or the ability to tamper with your DNA.
[02:05:23.688 --> 02:05:24.949]  Unless we gave them that ability.
[02:05:27.070 --> 02:05:28.231]  Here's Robert Malone.
[02:05:28.251 --> 02:05:29.632]  This is Robert Malone on Glenn Beck.
[02:05:29.672 --> 02:05:30.493]  Listen to what he says.
[02:05:30.533 --> 02:05:30.813]  Listen.
[02:05:31.434 --> 02:05:35.757]  A joint report from the government of the UK and Germany about transhumanism.
[02:05:36.878 --> 02:05:40.060]  And as you know, this is one of the agendas of the World Economic Forum.
[02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:40.801]  That's not hidden.
[02:05:40.821 --> 02:05:41.982]  That's not a conspiracy.
[02:05:42.342 --> 02:05:43.123]  Transhumanism.
[02:05:43.163 --> 02:05:46.285]  And they talk about the RNA vaccines as an entry point.
[02:05:47.074 --> 02:05:52.896]  You say they're tampering with our DNA, that they're able to shut down our immune systems by the addition of something to our DNA.
[02:05:52.716 --> 02:05:59.716]   Part of the push for these particular products is it relates to that transhumanism agenda.
[02:06:00.716 --> 02:06:00.376]   You say they're tampering with our DNA, that they're able to shut down our immune systems by the addition of
[02:06:00.376 --> 02:06:07.716]  something to our DNA.
[02:06:07.716 --> 02:06:09.716]  Yes, but I don't know how exactly.
[02:06:09.716 --> 02:06:10.716]  How it's being triggered.
[02:06:10.716 --> 02:06:12.716]  I don't know that either.
[02:06:12.716 --> 02:06:14.716]  For why it's happening now.
[02:06:15.285 --> 02:06:17.927]  What can we possibly do?
[02:06:17.987 --> 02:06:19.148]  We need to act quickly.
[02:06:19.609 --> 02:06:20.709]  You were right about that.
[02:06:20.769 --> 02:06:22.271]  Well, I was wrong about the science.
[02:06:22.971 --> 02:06:24.352]  I was wrong about what's causing it.
[02:06:24.392 --> 02:06:25.253]  Dead wrong, in fact.
[02:06:25.553 --> 02:06:29.496]  But it's clearly a widespread failure of our immune systems.
[02:06:29.736 --> 02:06:30.757]  Through gene tampering.
[02:06:30.917 --> 02:06:34.259]  A virus within a virus that was put there through the smallpox vaccine.
[02:06:34.319 --> 02:06:36.281]  It's what these men are calling the Spartan virus.
[02:06:39.039 --> 02:06:39.640]  Interesting!
[02:06:39.700 --> 02:06:43.004]  Now if we go to TimeToFreeAmerica.com forward slash revelation.
[02:06:43.064 --> 02:06:45.687]  TimeToFreeAmerica.com forward slash revelation.
[02:06:45.727 --> 02:06:46.728]  Did you know this, folks?
[02:06:46.748 --> 02:06:47.229]  Did you know this?
[02:06:47.549 --> 02:06:49.651]  There's a technology out there called CRISPR.
[02:06:49.972 --> 02:06:50.973]  And someone says, what is that?
[02:06:51.373 --> 02:06:51.814]  CRISPR.
[02:06:51.894 --> 02:06:52.635]  C-R-I-S-P-R.
[02:06:54.786 --> 02:06:55.086]  CRISPR.
[02:06:55.367 --> 02:07:13.657]  And on December 9th of 2019, the technology was created to use the mRNA technology created by Dr. Malone to put CRISPR gene editing technology inside your body, thus making it possible to deliver a lipid nanoparticle, lipid meaning fat cell, nanoparticle, computer, inside your body that could deliver a pathogen.
[02:07:14.275 --> 02:07:20.103]  So if you have a shot inside your body, you could then have your immune system be turned off or turned on.
[02:07:20.143 --> 02:07:21.425]  Your body could release a pathogen.
[02:07:21.705 --> 02:07:27.753]  This was all prophesied, and I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, we are living through the implementation of what's called the Great Reset.
[02:07:29.155 --> 02:07:30.176]  Go to YouTube real quick, folks.
[02:07:30.216 --> 02:07:33.438]  Go to YouTube and search for Dark Seed Grimes.
[02:07:33.798 --> 02:07:35.700]  Dark Seed Grimes, okay?
[02:07:35.720 --> 02:07:40.903]  It's D-A-R-K-S-E-I-D and then Grimes on YouTube right now, okay?
[02:07:41.203 --> 02:07:47.728]  So right before the pandemic began, right before the pandemic began, Grimes released a song called Dark Seed.
[02:07:48.548 --> 02:07:57.174]  Now in 1971, Jack Kirby created a character called Dark Seed that runs around the world putting RNA-modifying nanotechnology inside people to eliminate free will.
[02:07:57.575 --> 02:07:57.815]  What?
[02:07:58.573 --> 02:08:05.975]  Jack Kirby created a character in 1971 called Dark Seed that runs around putting RNA-modifying nanotechnology inside humans to control their free will.
[02:08:06.435 --> 02:08:10.316]  And the character's called Dark Seed, and he introduces a thing called the Fourth Kingdom.
[02:08:10.796 --> 02:08:14.357]  And in the book of Daniel, Chapter 7, there's this thing called the Fourth Kingdom.
[02:08:14.577 --> 02:08:17.177]  And then Klaus Schwab talks about the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
[02:08:17.437 --> 02:08:18.918]  So think about it again.
[02:08:19.178 --> 02:08:20.898]  In 1971, Rules for Radicals was written.
[02:08:22.091 --> 02:08:22.271]  What?
[02:08:22.711 --> 02:08:25.392]  In 1971, Disney's Epcot Center was created.
[02:08:26.032 --> 02:08:26.252]  What?
[02:08:26.892 --> 02:08:30.433]  In 1971, the world got off the World Economic... What?
[02:08:30.833 --> 02:08:34.414]  In 1971, America got off the gold standard, per the recommendation of who?
[02:08:35.055 --> 02:08:35.795]  Henry Kissinger.
[02:08:35.895 --> 02:08:39.536]  So in 1971, America got off the gold standard, per the recommendation of Henry Kissinger.
[02:08:39.916 --> 02:08:42.797]  In 1971, the World Economic Forum was founded.
[02:08:43.097 --> 02:08:45.177]  In 1971, Rules for Radicals was written.
[02:08:45.578 --> 02:08:47.878]  In 1971, the Disney Epcot Center was created.
[02:08:48.278 --> 02:08:50.659]  In 1971, the Dark Seed comic character was created.
[02:08:50.899 --> 02:08:54.283]  And in 1971, America began sacrificing babies to Baal.
[02:08:54.663 --> 02:08:55.985]  It's a 50-year plan.
[02:08:56.245 --> 02:08:59.468]  They started it in 1971 into 72.
[02:08:59.869 --> 02:09:02.311]  And it's all designed to be implemented right now.
[02:09:02.572 --> 02:09:06.216]  We are living through the spiritual battle that was prophesied in the Bible.
[02:09:06.256 --> 02:09:07.417]  We are living through it right now.
[02:09:07.737 --> 02:09:10.901]  And if you don't believe me, there's a great prophet by the name of Robin Bullock.
[02:09:11.321 --> 02:09:15.805]  One of the few pastors I know willing to call out Yuval Noah Harari.
[02:09:15.845 --> 02:09:18.968]  So listen to the song by Grimes called Dark Seed.
[02:09:19.328 --> 02:09:20.509]  It's written in Chinese.
[02:09:21.029 --> 02:09:22.931]  It features an artist by the name of Pan.
[02:09:23.531 --> 02:09:24.472]  It's called Dark Seed.
[02:09:24.492 --> 02:09:26.474]  It was released right before the pandemic.
[02:09:26.934 --> 02:09:27.194]  What?
[02:09:27.555 --> 02:09:28.115]  Next question.
[02:09:28.355 --> 02:09:31.498]  Why does Yuval Noah Harari insist on calling humans hackable animals?
[02:09:33.159 --> 02:09:35.421]  Dr. Meehan, he refers... Let me play this audio clip here.
[02:09:35.682 --> 02:09:39.928]   Yuval Noah Harari insists I'm calling humans hackable animals.
[02:09:39.948 --> 02:09:40.449]  Here we go.
[02:09:40.469 --> 02:09:42.931]  Humans are now hackable animals.
[02:09:44.452 --> 02:09:53.678]  You know, the whole idea that humans have, you know, this, they have this soul or spirit and they have free will and nobody knows what's happening inside me.
[02:09:54.138 --> 02:09:59.722]  So whatever I choose, whether in the election or whether in the supermarket, this is my free will.
[02:09:59.903 --> 02:10:00.463]  That's over.
[02:10:00.643 --> 02:10:02.103]  So I want to just tee this up, okay?
[02:10:02.123 --> 02:10:03.224]  So think about this for a second, okay?
[02:10:03.244 --> 02:10:30.653]   The monkeypox outbreak is being pushed right now, and they're saying that the only way to stop it, the World Health Organization, Dr. Michael J. Ryan says the only way to stop it is for all countries to comply, and any country that won't comply, no matter where in the world you are, the World Health Organization has the authority to deploy assets onto foreign soil, into sovereign nations to stop the outbreak, and they want to put a monkeypox vaccine inside your body, That has the mRNA technology in it.
[02:10:31.153 --> 02:10:32.653]  That integrates into your genome.
[02:10:32.773 --> 02:10:43.597]  I mean, it's been published in multiple medical journals now, confirmed that the mRNA vaccines are transcribing and inserting DNA sequences into the liver cells.
[02:10:43.997 --> 02:10:48.378]  So, what you saw in the X-Files, that predictive programming, that's occurring right now.
[02:10:48.758 --> 02:10:52.641]  So what I wanted people to do right now is I'm going to give you guys three free tools right now.
[02:10:52.681 --> 02:11:00.366]  If you're listening and you want to be able to explain this to your friends and family, go to TimeToFreeAmerica.com forward slash revelation.
[02:11:00.406 --> 02:11:02.387]  That's the entire timeline of what we talked about.

[02:11:05.689 --> 02:11:07.170]  All the patents that prove the plan.
[02:11:07.210 --> 02:11:11.173]  You can see that the system and method for testing for COVID-19 was patented in 2015.
[02:11:13.112 --> 02:11:15.914]  The system and method for testing for COVID-19 was patented in 2015.
[02:11:16.174 --> 02:11:19.335]  You can see the patents for the RNA-modifying nanotechnology that goes inside the human body.
[02:11:19.636 --> 02:11:21.837]  You can see the patents for the CRISPR gene-editing technology.
[02:11:22.137 --> 02:11:24.958]  It's all there at timetofreeamerica.com forward slash revelation.
[02:11:25.359 --> 02:11:29.921]  Two, if you go to timetofreeamerica.com, you can download my newest book absolutely for free.
[02:11:30.381 --> 02:11:32.603]  It's called The Great Reawakening vs. The Great Reset.

[02:11:35.384 --> 02:11:38.446]  If you want to buy the book, you can go to the bookstore and do it, but you can download the book for free.
[02:11:38.946 --> 02:11:46.487]  Three, you can watch the Reawaken America Tour documentary absolutely for free by going to the shopping cart at TimeToFreeAmerica.com.
[02:11:46.787 --> 02:11:47.788]  But here's what's happening, okay?
[02:11:47.828 --> 02:11:49.968]  We have just under 1,000 tickets remaining.
[02:11:49.988 --> 02:11:57.229]  We have 997 tickets remaining before I hopped on the show today for the Reawaken America Tour July 8th and 9th in Virginia Beach.
[02:11:57.269 --> 02:12:00.170]  I'm telling you this not because I'm prophetic, but because I've read their plan.
[02:12:00.910 --> 02:12:05.931]  They are going to try to impose a lockdown of some sort between now and July 4th.
[02:12:06.929 --> 02:12:13.277]  And what I need you to do is I need you to show that the American Spirit is not dead, and that you believe that Jesus is King and that we're gonna win this thing.
[02:12:13.297 --> 02:12:15.701]  We're not gonna submit to the World Health Organization.
[02:12:15.741 --> 02:12:20.567]  God has given us authority and dominion over these devils, so we gotta show up en masse.
[02:12:20.587 --> 02:12:25.452]   We're 997 tickets away from Uh, selling out, but I need you to actually show up.
[02:12:25.492 --> 02:12:41.283]  We've got Dr. Zelenko, we have General Flynn will be there, Donald J. Trump Jr., Eric Trump will be there, Jim Brewer, Mike Lindell, Dr. Jim Meehan will be there, Lance Wallnau, The Prophet, Roger Stone, Simone Gold, Sean Foyd, Dr. Dave Martin, Mel Kay, Dr. Judy Mikovits.
[02:12:41.383 --> 02:12:47.848]   I mean, they're all going to be there, but I need you to show up because if you comply to the lockdowns, America will die.
[02:12:47.868 --> 02:12:51.310]  So if you're going to request those tickets, go to Timetofreeamerica.com.
[02:12:51.671 --> 02:12:52.811]  Timetofreeamerica.com.
[02:12:52.831 --> 02:12:55.853]  And when our team calls you, we have to verify that you're not Antifa.
[02:12:56.094 --> 02:12:57.034]  You can name your price.
[02:12:57.414 --> 02:13:01.457]  It's going to cost me several hundred thousand dollars to put on this event and every event we've ever done.
[02:13:01.497 --> 02:13:02.698]  I don't take an income from this.
[02:13:02.958 --> 02:13:03.979]  I don't take a salary.
[02:13:04.199 --> 02:13:05.600]  But I need you to name your price.
[02:13:05.620 --> 02:13:06.841]  You can pay whatever you want there.
[02:13:07.201 --> 02:13:14.006]  If you use promo code InfoWars, we'll give you free access to the meet and greet where you can meet thousands of listeners to the InfoWars program.
[02:13:14.466 --> 02:13:18.487]  And if you can, folks, go to Infowars.com and buy something.
[02:13:18.827 --> 02:13:20.887]  Buy anything from Alex Jones.
[02:13:20.947 --> 02:13:21.487]  Buy something.
[02:13:21.527 --> 02:13:22.668]  Support this great program.
[02:13:22.688 --> 02:13:24.328]  He's been doing a great work for a long time.
[02:13:24.708 --> 02:13:30.529]  And I also encourage you to go to MeehanMD because, Dr. Meehan, most doctors are forcing the COVID-19 shots on their patients.
[02:13:30.849 --> 02:13:33.330]  Are you forcing the COVID-19 shots on your patients?
[02:13:33.390 --> 02:13:42.032]   I'm forcing my patients to read for themselves, do their own research, and understand that the COVID vaccines have We have no long-term studies on.
[02:13:42.112 --> 02:13:46.394]  We have short-term studies that are showing horrific damage to vaccine recipients.
[02:13:46.494 --> 02:13:48.415]  So I encourage you to go to mehandmd.com.
[02:13:48.495 --> 02:13:49.856]  Save that website in your phone.
[02:13:50.256 --> 02:13:51.537]  Mehandmd.com.
[02:13:51.557 --> 02:13:52.998]  Get your tickets to the Reawaken America Tour.
[02:13:53.018 --> 02:13:59.041]  We're also going to New York, Rochester, New York in August to get your tickets at time2freeamerica.com.
[02:13:59.061 --> 02:14:01.182]  My name is Clay Clark filling in for the great Alex Jones.
[02:14:01.382 --> 02:14:17.382]  Thank you for listening and buy something at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:14:17.600 --> 02:14:20.864]  Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[02:14:20.904 --> 02:14:21.605]  You see it every year.
[02:14:21.625 --> 02:14:23.967]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers.
[02:14:24.748 --> 02:14:26.450]  50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[02:14:27.071 --> 02:14:37.159]  And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups, because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this.
[02:14:37.179 --> 02:14:48.427]  So, it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody, to be able to do things tax-wise that's legal and lawful, that allows you to keep more of your money.
[02:14:48.467 --> 02:14:52.691]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[02:14:53.925 --> 02:14:58.910]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL jonestaxrelief.com.
[02:14:59.130 --> 02:15:01.552]  One word, jonestaxrelief.com or call 833-900-4285.
[02:15:01.372 --> 02:15:08.372]  Call 833-900-4285.
[02:15:08.372 --> 02:15:29.372]  [Music]
[02:15:29.372 --> 02:15:31.372]  We all live in a world where we're not allowed to be afraid.
[02:15:30.685 --> 02:15:32.286]  It is the Summit News Hour.
[02:15:32.326 --> 02:15:45.432]  We've got a ton of news to cover over the course of the next hour, including a massive scandal out of a European country, which basically, as I always say, should be one of the top news stories in the world.
[02:15:45.972 --> 02:16:07.960]   We have the rich and famous of Spain being caught in a massive scam, full-on police investigation, wealthy elitists, sports people, TV personalities, Right across the board, buying, paying illegally for fake COVID vaccine certificates so they don't have to take the vaccine.
[02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:16.386]  This included top medical personnel and the head of a major pharmaceutical company involved in researching COVID drugs.
[02:16:16.967 --> 02:16:21.711]  So the very same people behind pushing the COVID vaccine don't want to take it themselves.
[02:16:22.418 --> 02:16:23.519]  Gee, I wonder why.
[02:16:23.579 --> 02:16:31.544]  Could it have anything to do with the fact that Australians under 40 have been urged to get heart checks due to sudden adult death syndrome?
[02:16:31.604 --> 02:16:37.808]  A new sudden death syndrome that involves young people that has just miraculously sprung up over the past six months.
[02:16:38.929 --> 02:16:43.872]  We have 5,000 non-COVID excess deaths in the last five weeks in the UK.
[02:16:43.912 --> 02:16:45.513]  What could possibly be causing that?
[02:16:45.553 --> 02:16:46.274]  Gee, I wonder.
[02:16:46.294 --> 02:16:55.245]   We have Joe Biden On Jimmy Kimmel engaging in some bizarre rant about there not being enough biracial couples on TV.
[02:16:55.545 --> 02:16:56.366]  They're everywhere.
[02:16:57.106 --> 02:17:13.292]  Which ties into a poll out of the UK, which I'm also going to get into, which shows that the general public thinks that transgenders, gays, Muslims, black people are vastly over-represented compared to their actual demographic figure in the country.
[02:17:13.372 --> 02:17:14.013]  Why is that?
[02:17:14.033 --> 02:17:17.274]  Well, we're going to tell you over the course of the next hour.
[02:17:18.052 --> 02:17:39.564]  We've also got the continuing monkeypox outbreak which a couple of weeks ago the World Health Organization came out and said we should really reconsider having summer festivals and mass gatherings apart from LGBT Pride Month gatherings though they're perfectly acceptable because just like the BLM rallies back in June 2020 apparently the virus just passes them right on by.
[02:17:39.584 --> 02:17:47.409]   Meanwhile the first monkeypox patient to go public Says that he caught the virus after having gay sex with ten men.
[02:17:47.529 --> 02:17:51.312]  What a fantastic lifestyle that we should definitely promote to young kids.
[02:17:51.932 --> 02:17:56.716]  Norwegian feminist faces three years in prison for saying biological men can't be lesbians.
[02:17:57.457 --> 02:17:58.617]  Again, Gay Pride Month.
[02:17:58.938 --> 02:18:00.199]  Marginalized community.
[02:18:00.299 --> 02:18:01.259]  Oppressed community.
[02:18:01.380 --> 02:18:01.740]  Really?
[02:18:02.406 --> 02:18:08.691]  When your critics are literally being arrested and thrown in prison for questioning you, not that marginalised.
[02:18:08.711 --> 02:18:16.658]  We have a UK police force being mocked over a gay pride tweet, where they literally said in the same tweet they're gonna monitor the responses for hate crimes.
[02:18:17.579 --> 02:18:25.885]  We have a Pride in the Park event in Idaho targeted at children, which includes drag queens and satanists who promise to unbaptise your children.
[02:18:25.905 --> 02:18:27.667]  Hands are we the baddies.
[02:18:28.894 --> 02:18:30.896]  Berlin car attack happened yesterday.
[02:18:30.956 --> 02:18:32.778]  They're blaming it on mental illness.
[02:18:32.798 --> 02:18:35.961]  That's been swept under the rug very quickly indeed.
[02:18:37.042 --> 02:18:37.783]  Then we have the, uh...
[02:18:38.456 --> 02:18:45.701]  Continuing fallout from the massive riots that took place before the Champions League final in Paris a couple of weeks ago.
[02:18:46.481 --> 02:18:47.722]  New polls on that.
[02:18:48.002 --> 02:19:01.411]  A new warning by Spain's Conservative Box Party that similar scenes of bedlam could spread to other areas of Europe thanks to mass migration and a complete lack of adequate integration of those migrants.
[02:19:02.292 --> 02:19:11.461]   We also have a poll out of the US where Trump voters believe They're being replaced by huge voting blocks of illegal migrants.
[02:19:11.901 --> 02:19:12.242]  73% of them.
[02:19:12.322 --> 02:19:15.162]  Not quite a minority fringe belief now, is it?
[02:19:16.263 --> 02:19:29.066]  Meanwhile, with the war between Ukraine and Russia, Ukraine has decided that it's definitely going to vanquish Putin's war machine by banning the classic historical novel, War and Peace, from being taught in schools.
[02:19:30.014 --> 02:19:42.137]  There's also a top Ukrainian official who was actually fired as a result of the Ukrainian Parliament voting against her for lying about Russians committing mass rape.
[02:19:42.397 --> 02:19:48.499]  And in this new development, she admits that it was to convince countries to send more weapons to Ukraine.
[02:19:48.519 --> 02:19:52.099]  We're going to get into all of that and more on the other side.
[02:19:52.419 --> 02:19:53.360]  Summit.News.
[02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:53.880]  We'll be back.
[02:19:53.900 --> 02:19:54.300]  Don't go away.
[02:19:55.310 --> 02:20:13.413]  We're live, it is the Summit.NewsHour, and as I mentioned in the previous segment, absolutely huge mammoth, monumental story out of Spain, which has actually been circulating for the past week or so, has got absolutely zero attention in the legacy media in the West, and for good reason.
[02:20:14.073 --> 02:20:26.303]   We have the headline, rich people in Spain, including pharmaceutical company president, caught buying fake Covid vaccine certificates, Of course, this is an issue that we've been covering for the past two years.
[02:20:26.323 --> 02:20:41.956]   I know people personally, not mentioning any names, quite wealthy people, quite prominent people who Told me outright how easy it was to buy fake Covid vaccine passports so they could travel the world without having to get the vaccine.
[02:20:42.376 --> 02:20:44.357]  And to be frank, who could blame them?
[02:20:44.897 --> 02:21:01.184]  But when it's the head of a pharmaceutical company literally involved in the vaccine and developing drugs to treat Covid, when it's literally top medical personnel pushing the vaccine on other people, pushing the vaccine on children, well that's quite the story, isn't it?
[02:21:01.744 --> 02:21:03.886]  And yet how much attention has it received in the West?
[02:21:04.346 --> 02:21:05.487]  Next to zero!
[02:21:06.408 --> 02:21:20.579]  Police in Spain have uncovered a scam involving more than 2,000 famous people, including top medical personnel and the head of a major pharmaceutical company, who illegally bought fake Covid-19 vaccination certificates from a nurse without taking the shot.
[02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:22.901]  And again, this has been going on for two years.
[02:21:22.941 --> 02:21:46.922]   The guy who sold these fake vaccine passports, which they used again to travel around the world, Made more than €200,000 personally for adding these rich and famous elites to a vaccine registry, a national database, allowing them to enjoy all the perks that the fully vaccinated have enjoyed for the past two years, of course, in Spain.
[02:21:47.853 --> 02:21:51.456]  Which had one of the most draconian lockdowns in Europe.
[02:21:51.857 --> 02:21:53.939]  They had drones patrolling the beaches.
[02:21:54.239 --> 02:21:59.924]  We featured numerous videos of cops beating up people for not wearing face masks in the street.
[02:22:00.524 --> 02:22:02.046]  I was there at the height of it.
[02:22:02.907 --> 02:22:10.834]  They literally had a rule where if you were hiking up a mountain, if you were swimming in the sea, you still had to wear a face mask.
[02:22:11.534 --> 02:22:27.439]   Well, certain people bypassed some of those restrictions, And this article out of Euro Weekly News says amongst those that have been investigated by the police are leading singers, musicians, football stars, business people, politicians and top medical personnel.
[02:22:27.939 --> 02:22:39.047]  The very same kind of people who will ingratiate themselves to public relations campaigns in encouraging others, demanding others to get the shot, demanding children to get the shot.
[02:22:39.947 --> 02:22:44.612]   And again, people say, well, This is over, and I really do hope it's over.
[02:22:44.952 --> 02:22:52.276]  But again, we saw yesterday, for example, on The View, they're again dragging these pro-regime, pro-regime narrative doctors on.
[02:22:52.696 --> 02:22:58.079]  They're saying when autumn winter comes, when everyone's back indoors, they're basically going to keep you indoors.
[02:22:58.099 --> 02:23:00.360]  They're going to try and bring this all back.
[02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.381]  Will they do it under the guise of monkeypox?
[02:23:03.461 --> 02:23:04.142]  Probably not.
[02:23:04.202 --> 02:23:05.903]  It's not lethal, not viral enough.
[02:23:06.363 --> 02:23:14.554]   Will they do it under COVID rebooted, now that everyone's been trained To follow orders, maybe that will be the case.
[02:23:14.634 --> 02:23:22.637]  But again, the very same people pushing the vaccine involved in all the public relations campaigns, heads of pharmaceutical companies.
[02:23:22.697 --> 02:23:33.901]  This is the president of Pharma Mar, Jose Maria Fernandez, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in Spain, a firm that has researched COVID-19 drug treatments.
[02:23:34.787 --> 02:23:37.928]  He did not get his third booster shot.
[02:23:37.968 --> 02:23:50.751]  He probably saw the footballers, who were also involved in this illegal scam, who then saw their colleagues collapsing and dying on football pitches mysteriously with this sudden adult death syndrome.
[02:23:51.472 --> 02:24:00.474]  So the 76-year-old businessman decided to just pay someone to add his name to a database, and he did not receive the third dose.
[02:24:01.761 --> 02:24:05.863]  And again, this individual who was carrying out this fraud made more than €200,000.
[02:24:06.063 --> 02:24:12.727]  He actually charged people more money based on how famous, how rich they were.
[02:24:12.827 --> 02:24:14.428]  So there was like a tier system.
[02:24:15.589 --> 02:24:31.017]  And again, as I point out in the article, it's interesting that there are numerous sports personalities and athletes on the list, including footballers, boxers and wrestlers, given the reports of a significant spike in adverse reactions and deaths suffered by sports stars over the last year.
[02:24:31.750 --> 02:24:34.392]  Of course, we reported on that on numerous occasions.
[02:24:34.492 --> 02:24:49.424]  Berliner Zeitung, one of the biggest newspapers in Germany, came out with a massive article that included a giant list of footballers who had had adverse reactions, not just footballers, other athletes, and some who had unfortunately also died.
[02:24:50.425 --> 02:25:08.745]   And as Will Jones of the Daily Skeptic points out, Let's not forget the biggest scandal here, that the president of a pharmaceutical company would be so wary of taking a drug which all the trials and medical authorities insist is safe and effective, what does he know that he's not letting on?
[02:25:10.129 --> 02:25:18.995]  Again, I briefly mentioned in the previous segment, we had this article, Paris clinics offering fake Covid passes for £250 of black market surges.
[02:25:19.035 --> 02:25:21.717]  That was happening summer 2021.
[02:25:22.417 --> 02:25:28.081]  Of course, the French had to have vaccine passports to get into cafes, bars and basically any public venue.
[02:25:29.262 --> 02:25:34.566]  We also had a headline, French elite caught violating lockdown rules by attending secret restaurants.
[02:25:34.606 --> 02:25:38.088]  This was during the second lockdown in April 2021.
[02:25:40.333 --> 02:25:42.376]  Again, many restaurants, of course, closed.
[02:25:42.396 --> 02:25:45.440]  They had the vaccine passports, but many of them were closed before that.
[02:25:46.261 --> 02:25:57.335]  While ordinary French people, Parisians, weren't able to go out, meet their friends, relatives, the French elite were busy having secret underground posh dinners.
[02:25:58.015 --> 02:26:01.596]  Where the rules were completely waived, they had their own staff flown in.
[02:26:01.756 --> 02:26:10.198]  Again, the same French elite pushing the vaccine, pushing the lockdown measures on everyone else, getting to avoid the consequences of that.
[02:26:11.418 --> 02:26:18.439]  And why would top medical personnel, why would top pharmaceutical presidents want to avoid getting the vaccine?
[02:26:18.479 --> 02:26:20.820]  Could it have anything to do with this?
[02:26:22.310 --> 02:26:29.716]  Valiant News reports Australians under 40 urged to get hearts checked due to sudden adult death syndrome.
[02:26:29.736 --> 02:26:46.608]  Yes, it is the meme returned once again, where you have the green lizards quaffing champagne, laughing about the fact, saying, and then we told them that there's this new thing that's just emerged out of nowhere called sudden adult death syndrome.
[02:26:47.409 --> 02:26:48.850]  How could that possibly be?
[02:26:48.930 --> 02:26:57.839]   What major event, what major Health treatment has been administered to the global population over the past two years, which could possibly cause this!
[02:26:58.900 --> 02:27:12.669]  Well, left to wonder, healthy people under the age of 40 in Australia are being urged to visit a cardiologist to get their hearts checked, as doctors work to understand a new and mysterious illness that has been causing unexpected deaths in young people.
[02:27:14.250 --> 02:27:17.932]   And again, This isn't something they've dragged out of the past.
[02:27:18.052 --> 02:27:22.337]  They've invented new clinics and new treatment for this and they're now rolling it out.
[02:27:23.239 --> 02:27:33.432]  Sudden Adult Death Syndrome, or SADS, S-A-D-S, has been found to be deadly for individuals regardless of whether they maintain a fit and healthy lifestyle or not.
[02:27:34.341 --> 02:27:44.704]  The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners said that SADS is an umbrella term to describe the sudden deaths in young people, which most commonly occur in people under 40 years of age.
[02:27:45.104 --> 02:27:48.085]  Just dropping dead like flies, what could that possibly be?
[02:27:48.685 --> 02:27:49.285]  Who knows?
[02:27:49.445 --> 02:27:50.205]  It's a mystery!
[02:27:50.926 --> 02:27:59.168]  Just like the hepatitis outbreaks in kids across the world, and some of them dying, some of them needing urgent organ transplants.
[02:27:59.944 --> 02:28:12.146]  is also a mystery and nothing whatsoever to do with the fact that their immune systems are completely shot either from taking the vaccine or either from lockdown as a result of not developing natural immunity.
[02:28:12.206 --> 02:28:17.267]  But again we're told it's a mystery and fact checkers have assured us that that's the proper explanation.
[02:28:18.588 --> 02:28:44.712]   Daily Skeptic reports what's behind the 5,000 non-covid excess deaths in the last five weeks This is in the UK, where new official data from the ONS released today added a further 730 non-COVID excess deaths in England and Wales to the total of the last five weeks, which means nearly 5,000 more people than usual have died in England and Wales in the last five weeks of causes other than COVID-19.
[02:28:45.072 --> 02:28:50.777]  Now that makes it a total death average of 10.1% above the five-year average.
[02:28:54.036 --> 02:29:06.320]  And the writer of this article points out that the new boosters for the elderly, for people in care homes, are now slowly being rolled out as we suddenly get, again, this mysterious excess deaths.
[02:29:07.180 --> 02:29:13.883]  Non-Covid deaths, 10.1% above the five-year average in the United Kingdom over the past few weeks.
[02:29:13.923 --> 02:29:24.158]   You'd think that would be a major story given how transfixed the news is with Deaths above the national average, but no, once again it's being brushed under the carpet.
[02:29:24.178 --> 02:29:27.542]  We're going to come back and we're going to talk about monkeypox.
[02:29:27.562 --> 02:29:33.670]  We're also going to talk about a shocking poll out of the UK which shows the potency of television brainwashing.
[02:29:33.710 --> 02:29:34.732]  Summit.News, we'll be back.
[02:29:35.546 --> 02:29:46.635]  We're gonna go to this first video now because it kind of ties in with Joe Biden's rambling incoherence last night on Jimmy Kimmel where he said, quote, he was talking about gun control.
[02:29:46.655 --> 02:29:47.996]  I don't know what he was on about.
[02:29:48.116 --> 02:29:49.497]  Nobody even does at this point.
[02:29:50.017 --> 02:29:52.539]  He's basically geriatric dementia ridden.
[02:29:53.040 --> 02:29:55.502]  Quote, you turn on the TV, look at the ads.
[02:29:56.062 --> 02:29:59.026]  When's the last time you saw biracial couples on TV?
[02:29:59.507 --> 02:30:01.049]  Well, every time!
[02:30:01.549 --> 02:30:07.417]  Especially in the UK, which has led to this poll, which is actually quite shocking given the, uh...
[02:30:08.414 --> 02:30:13.819]  Significant difference in the demographic reality of the make-up of the United Kingdom.
[02:30:14.280 --> 02:30:21.306]  And what the British general public thinks is the demographic make-up of the United Kingdom.
[02:30:21.727 --> 02:30:27.412]  And it really goes to the point of how easily the general public is misled.
[02:30:27.452 --> 02:30:28.513]  Let's go to this video.
[02:30:28.633 --> 02:30:29.094]  Here it is.
[02:30:29.667 --> 02:30:34.875]  The alarming results of a new poll underscore how the general public is so easily led.
[02:30:34.895 --> 02:30:43.589]  A YouGov survey found that the British population thinks minority groups make up a far larger percentage of the population than is actually the case.
[02:30:43.629 --> 02:30:47.152]   They think 5% They think only 65% of the population is white.
[02:30:47.232 --> 02:30:48.112]  It's actually around 87%.
[02:30:48.152 --> 02:30:49.792]  They think 20% of the population is black.
[02:30:49.812 --> 02:30:50.412]  It's actually 3%.
[02:30:50.853 --> 02:30:53.333]  They think 15% of the population is Muslim.
[02:30:53.292 --> 02:30:55.493]  it's actually around 87%.
[02:30:55.493 --> 02:30:59.292]   They think 20% of the population is black, it's actually 3%.
[02:30:59.292 --> 02:31:03.292]   They think 15% of the population is Muslim, it's actually 4%.
[02:31:03.292 --> 02:31:07.493]  And they think 15% of men in the UK are gay.
[02:31:07.639 --> 02:31:08.160]  It's actually 1.3%.
[02:31:08.820 --> 02:31:14.685]  The Daily Skeptic asks, is it because minorities are so over-represented in the mainstream media?
[02:31:14.785 --> 02:31:15.986]  Is the Pope Catholic?
[02:31:16.146 --> 02:31:20.710]  What is the population seeing that's causing them to be so massively misled?
[02:31:20.910 --> 02:31:29.735]   All of these groups being substantially Over-represented on television, particularly in TV commercials, and in advertising generally.
[02:31:29.775 --> 02:31:36.598]  While many of the lobby groups claiming to represent those minorities continually whining about a lack of representation.
[02:31:36.718 --> 02:31:46.183]  It's incredible that when it comes to deciphering the corporeal reality of the world around them, people place more stock in what they're told to believe is reality.
[02:31:46.283 --> 02:31:53.206]   Via television, social media, and institutionalized culture, Then they do their own eyes and real world experiences.
[02:31:53.346 --> 02:31:56.968]  People delude themselves into thinking that everyone is waking up.
[02:31:57.028 --> 02:32:03.151]  But you just have to accept the fact that much of the general public lacks basic critical thinking skills.
[02:32:03.311 --> 02:32:09.434]  And a huge chunk of them always have and always will be susceptible to regime narratives.
[02:32:09.574 --> 02:32:10.355]  Case in point.
[02:32:10.395 --> 02:32:14.437]  And I've drawn on about this relentlessly because it never received the attention it deserved.
[02:32:14.577 --> 02:32:20.020]  In the summer of 2020, a poll was conducted asking Brits about the impact of COVID.
[02:32:20.140 --> 02:32:23.742]  At the time, the official figure of Brits who had died from COVID was 155,000.
[02:32:25.303 --> 02:32:31.787]  But the average Brit, when asked, thought that it had killed 6-7% of the population.
[02:32:31.887 --> 02:32:34.669]  That's 4.5 million people!
[02:32:34.749 --> 02:32:35.869]  Why would they think that?
[02:32:36.029 --> 02:32:38.871]  Regime narratives, television brainwashing.
[02:32:38.971 --> 02:32:44.852]  They bang on about misinformation, coercing people to believe in dangerous non-existent things.
[02:32:44.932 --> 02:32:58.016]  Yet the constant firehose of social engineering brought about by regime narratives has created an entire population of people who can't even accurately grasp the true nature of the immediate world around them.
[02:33:00.816 --> 02:33:06.978]  Now talking about regime narratives, we've got one emerging on the monkey pox virus.
[02:33:07.887 --> 02:33:11.350]  Breitbart reports monkeypox outbreak tops 1,000 cases.
[02:33:11.610 --> 02:33:13.091]  WHO warns of real risk.
[02:33:13.832 --> 02:33:20.337]  The risk of monkeypox becoming established in non-endemic nations is real, the WHO warned Wednesday.
[02:33:20.417 --> 02:33:21.558]  And again, I've made the point.
[02:33:22.359 --> 02:33:28.944]  Part of the reason for that is they sell what they call bush meat, which is basically rats and things like that.
[02:33:29.264 --> 02:33:35.169]  Nice delicacies in certain migrant heavy areas of London and other major cities.
[02:33:35.189 --> 02:33:36.450]  That's contributed to it.
[02:33:37.054 --> 02:33:50.152]  They came out two weeks ago, of course, the WHO and said it would probably be best to curtail summer festivals and mass gatherings because that would stop the acceleration of the spread of monkeypox.
[02:33:50.822 --> 02:33:55.666]  But then of course days later they came out and said, oh but not gay pride marches!
[02:33:56.246 --> 02:34:03.912]  Even though it literally emerged, most of the cases in Europe emerged out of a fetish festival in Belgium.
[02:34:04.052 --> 02:34:06.614]  Again, you want to expose your kids to this lifestyle.
[02:34:07.194 --> 02:34:08.855]  And a gay sauna in Spain.
[02:34:09.756 --> 02:34:13.679]  So they admitted that it was circulating in the gay men population.
[02:34:14.437 --> 02:34:20.202]  But then they said gay pride marches should go ahead as normal, despite the fact that it spreads via close contact.
[02:34:20.262 --> 02:34:40.699]  Again, just as we literally had top public health officials and doctors coming out of their surgeries, their practices out of hospitals, to applaud Black Lives Matter protesters back in June 2020, who were out on the streets congregating in huge numbers, even as they told us that Covid was spreading.
[02:34:41.638 --> 02:34:42.539]  We have another headline.
[02:34:42.599 --> 02:34:44.860]  Monkeypox patient says he caught virus.
[02:34:46.021 --> 02:34:51.985]  The first one to go public, he was very proud about this, after having gay sex with around 10 new partners.
[02:34:52.345 --> 02:34:52.745]  Nice!
[02:34:53.045 --> 02:34:53.646]  Lovely stuff.
[02:34:53.686 --> 02:34:55.687]  Again, this is what we should expose kids to.
[02:34:56.888 --> 02:35:07.835]  The first Monkeypox patient to go public revealed that he caught the virus from having gay sex with around 10 new partners after being deported from Dubai for testing positive for HIV.
[02:35:08.335 --> 02:35:14.679]   Yes, he had sex with 10 men Presumably within the space of about two weeks.
[02:35:14.899 --> 02:35:21.404]  Again, very healthy, very, very contentful lifestyle that we should be pushing on kids.
[02:35:21.444 --> 02:35:33.493]  This is 35-year-old James M, who spoke to the media after complaining of illness and said the health officials in the UK still haven't contacted him despite him being diagnosed with monkeypox over two weeks ago.
[02:35:33.513 --> 02:35:40.584]   But again, WHO says no, gay pride marches should go ahead as normal.
[02:35:40.624 --> 02:35:41.805]  That's more important!
[02:35:42.706 --> 02:35:48.133]  Norwegian feminist faces three years in prison for saying biological men can't be lesbians again.
[02:35:49.082 --> 02:35:57.125]  This is a marginalised, oppressed community, a marginalised, oppressed movement, which if you criticise it in any way, they'll try and get you locked up.
[02:35:57.425 --> 02:36:06.067]  And they're endorsed by every cultural institution, corporation, bank, and government in the West, but they're marginalised people, okay?
[02:36:06.607 --> 02:36:14.610]  Christina Ellingson of the global feminist organisation Women's Declaration International is under police investigation for making the claim in a tweet.
[02:36:15.296 --> 02:36:18.860]  In which she criticised, how dare she, a trans-activism group, she said.
[02:36:19.260 --> 02:36:22.444]  Why does FRI teach young people that males can be lesbians?
[02:36:23.645 --> 02:36:38.993]   Of course, we had a story a few months ago about the Finnish minister, Pavi Rassanen, ...who faced hate speech charges for citing Bible verses which describe homosexuality as shameful and unnatural, although she was later acquitted.
[02:36:39.033 --> 02:36:49.641]  We had Christian pastors on the streets of the UK being arrested by police because some passerby whined about it because he was reading out a Bible passage.
[02:36:50.399 --> 02:37:01.803]  Last year, officers in Merseyside, also in England, took part in an electronic ad campaign outside a supermarket which claimed, with a giant banner behind them, that being offensive is an offence.
[02:37:01.863 --> 02:37:05.204]  That's actually not the case, at least at the moment, legally.
[02:37:05.224 --> 02:37:14.274]   We also had, of course, the case up in Hull, again in England, where a man Didn't even tweet anything.
[02:37:14.334 --> 02:37:18.221]  He liked a limerick which poked fun at transgender people.
[02:37:18.541 --> 02:37:20.504]  He was investigated by the police.
[02:37:21.166 --> 02:37:22.528]  He was fired from his job.
[02:37:23.385 --> 02:37:26.466]  Meanwhile, UK police force mocked over gay pride tweet.
[02:37:26.506 --> 02:37:33.988]  This was Essex police who, by the way, literally have people on their turf being stabbed in the street in broad daylight.
[02:37:34.028 --> 02:37:42.531]  Apparently they can't deal with that because they're too busy celebrating diversity by flying the pride flag to honor those who championed equality.
[02:37:43.051 --> 02:37:48.119]   And in this same tweet, they also Politely mentioned, we're monitoring our posts.
[02:37:48.219 --> 02:37:51.262]  All hate crime will be reported and investigated.
[02:37:51.702 --> 02:38:03.653]  Meanwhile, back in 2015, the head of the National Police Chief Union in the UK said that burglaries would no longer be investigated by the police because they didn't have the resources, but they have the resources for this.
[02:38:03.713 --> 02:38:04.234]  We'll be back.

[02:38:24.634 --> 02:38:25.634]  [Music]
[02:38:25.634 --> 02:38:29.914]   Now I want to come back and talk about the continuing fallout from this bedlam that
[02:38:29.914 --> 02:38:35.513]   occurred before the Champions League soccer final in Paris a couple of weeks ago because
[02:38:35.513 --> 02:38:37.914]  we have new developments on that.
[02:38:38.440 --> 02:38:54.062]   First though I want to get into this video that went up just a couple of hours ago rounding off on the Gay Pride Month content Of course I talked about the patrolling of tweets, the Norwegian feminist arrested for basically saying men are men.
[02:38:55.043 --> 02:39:06.631]  We have of course a Pride in the Park event in Idaho being targeted at children featuring drag queens and satanists and this is a wrap-up of all that's happened in terms of Gay Pride Month over the past week.
[02:39:06.631 --> 02:39:15.672]  here is the video.
[02:39:15.742 --> 02:39:18.924]  I keep hearing bigots say it always seems like Gay Pride Month.
[02:39:19.064 --> 02:39:19.625]  Nonsense.
[02:39:19.705 --> 02:39:23.448]  This movement never tries to constantly make itself the centre of attention.
[02:39:24.428 --> 02:39:38.379]  Look, just because it's endorsed by every major Western government, cultural institution, corporation, bank, entertainment industry, organ and legacy media outlet, just because in many Western countries you can get arrested and imprisoned for critiquing them, doesn't mean they're still not marginalised.
[02:39:38.539 --> 02:39:42.642]  The original Gay Pride flag only represents gays, lesbians and bisexuals.
[02:39:42.722 --> 02:39:44.123]  That's not very inclusive.
[02:39:44.183 --> 02:39:48.567]  By today's standards, it's basically a bigoted throwback on a par with the Confederate flag.
[02:39:48.607 --> 02:39:52.490]  The updated one to that includes pink, white and baby blue for trans representation.
[02:39:52.530 --> 02:39:56.253]  The updated one to that includes black and brown for people of colour representation.
[02:39:56.293 --> 02:39:59.535]  The updated one to that includes hot pink to represent...
[02:40:00.569 --> 02:40:01.630]  Women, don't ask me.
[02:40:01.670 --> 02:40:06.575]  And the update at once of that includes a purple ring on a yellow background to represent intersex people.
[02:40:06.655 --> 02:40:08.256]  But not even that was enough.
[02:40:08.537 --> 02:40:15.903]  One of the main organisers of Dublin's Gay Pride Parade added the colours of Ukraine to the LGBTQ rainbow flag.
[02:40:18.400 --> 02:40:23.282]  Yeah, they took a flag already more crowded than a tin of sardines and made it more crowded.
[02:40:23.402 --> 02:40:34.907]  Once again, woke transnational corporations went full rainbow washing to secure that pink pound, while mysteriously forgetting to update their logos and branding in a certain part of the world.
[02:40:34.987 --> 02:40:36.508]  It's that time of the year again.
[02:40:36.628 --> 02:40:38.209]  Gay Pride Vaseline.
[02:40:38.409 --> 02:40:41.330]  The exact same product, just double the price.
[02:40:41.530 --> 02:40:42.851]  Gay Pride Vaseline.
[02:40:45.037 --> 02:40:47.759]  I prefer really not to... not to speak.
[02:40:48.439 --> 02:40:50.200]  If I speak, I am in big trouble.
[02:40:51.220 --> 02:40:51.821]  In big trouble.
[02:40:52.061 --> 02:40:53.281]  And I don't want to be in big trouble.
[02:40:53.321 --> 02:40:58.264]  Burger King is celebrating Pride Month by allowing you to choose top or bottom bread baps!
[02:40:58.324 --> 02:41:00.605]  That'll stop Saudi Arabia beheading the gays!
[02:41:01.026 --> 02:41:05.448]  Q8's government summoned a top US diplomat in a minor international spat.
[02:41:05.588 --> 02:41:05.968]  Why?
[02:41:06.068 --> 02:41:09.430]  Because the US Embassy in Q8 tweeted its endorsement of Gay Pride Month.
[02:41:09.570 --> 02:41:10.611]  Well, this is awkward.
[02:41:10.691 --> 02:41:13.412]  Gay Pride March on the Q80 Embassy in DC.
[02:41:13.632 --> 02:41:14.633]  Yeah, don't hold your breath.
[02:41:14.833 --> 02:41:26.256]  A Pride in the Park event in Idaho to mark Gay Pride Month, geared towards children, will include the participation of drag queens as well as Satanists who have vowed to perform un-baptisms.
[02:41:26.376 --> 02:41:27.957]  Hans, are we the baddies?
[02:41:28.117 --> 02:41:33.118]  Bigots say kids shouldn't be exposed to LGBT themes or Gay Pride marches.
[02:41:33.178 --> 02:41:33.658]  Nonsense.
[02:41:33.818 --> 02:41:38.640]  Why wouldn't we want to enroll kids into such a healthy lifestyle of lifelong joy and contentment?
[02:41:38.660 --> 02:41:43.801]  They claim it's an inherently sexualized environment that children should be kept away from.
[02:41:44.121 --> 02:41:48.627]  World Health Organization's Andy Seale said gay pride parades were family friendly.
[02:41:48.767 --> 02:41:50.068]  And who could argue with him?
[02:41:50.108 --> 02:41:53.953]  Who wants to be a diva for the day?
[02:41:54.093 --> 02:41:54.213]  Yeah?
[02:41:54.254 --> 02:41:56.536]  Everybody come back here with me.
[02:41:56.616 --> 02:42:19.756]   *music* So family-friendly!
[02:42:19.459 --> 02:42:22.821]  Pride parades and the pride festivals that follow are noisy and crowded.
[02:42:23.061 --> 02:42:27.842]  They're filled with sights that may be new to kids, like public nudity and kink.
[02:42:28.363 --> 02:42:30.983]  So is it appropriate to take your young kids to Pride?
[02:42:31.083 --> 02:42:32.964]  The answer is absolutely!
[02:42:33.104 --> 02:42:35.285]  Family-friendly, child-appropriate.
[02:42:36.525 --> 02:42:37.746]  Public nudity and kink.
[02:42:40.049 --> 02:42:41.971]  That's your puppy?
[02:42:41.991 --> 02:42:42.652]  That's not weird.
[02:42:42.732 --> 02:42:44.194]  Who would have a problem with that?
[02:42:44.294 --> 02:42:46.617]  I'm getting the word nuts.
[02:42:46.897 --> 02:42:48.519]  This slope feels awful slippery.
[02:42:48.378 --> 02:42:53.898]   Now Senator Scott Wiener wants to add Drag Queen 101 to the K-12 curriculum.
[02:42:53.898 --> 02:43:00.217]  I mean let's be honest.
[02:43:00.422 --> 02:43:01.802]  Childhood innocence?
[02:43:01.863 --> 02:43:05.144]  That's just a concept invented out of thin air by prejudice homophobes.
[02:43:05.725 --> 02:43:17.111]  The WHO, the global health authority tasked with stopping the spread of viruses, warned that summer festivals and mass gatherings could accelerate the spread of monkey pox, but then asserted that gay pride marches should go ahead as normal.
[02:43:17.171 --> 02:43:19.993]   Meanwhile, the first monkey pox Lovely stuff!
[02:43:19.813 --> 02:43:25.833]   ago, public revealed that he caught the virus from having gay sex with around 10 new partners
[02:43:25.833 --> 02:43:29.272]   after being deported from Dubai for testing positive for HIV.
[02:43:29.272 --> 02:43:30.272]  Lovely stuff.
[02:43:30.272 --> 02:43:35.593]   They say life imitates art, but increasingly it feels like life imitates memes.
[02:43:35.593 --> 02:43:40.913]   Remember all those memes about the military industrial complex legitimising its neo-imperialist
[02:43:40.913 --> 02:43:46.913]   wars of conquest and occupation by painting the bombs in LGBT rainbow colours?
[02:43:46.892 --> 02:43:50.174]  Yeah, well the US Marines literally just fulfilled that meme.
[02:43:50.254 --> 02:43:51.514]  Proud to serve.
[02:43:51.995 --> 02:43:52.455]  And look!
[02:43:53.135 --> 02:43:54.016]  Gay bullets!
[02:43:54.236 --> 02:43:56.617]  Another Babylon Bee headline becomes reality.
[02:43:56.697 --> 02:44:04.440]   Next time people start whining about another Middle Eastern country being destroyed and obliterated for generations, Just call them homophobes!
[02:44:04.540 --> 02:44:11.422]  Lest we forget transgender Ukrainian troops who now go to war under the insignia of a gay unicorn.
[02:44:11.462 --> 02:44:20.083]  The image of a unicorn, sewn into its standard issue epaulettes, Romanova identifies as non-binary and uses she-her pronouns.
[02:44:20.284 --> 02:44:22.204]  Azov Battalion, eat your heart out!
[02:44:22.244 --> 02:44:34.527]   Maybe if Wenzelensky's democratic stormtroopers had gone door-to-door kidnapping dissidents for criticising him, they'd have just done so under the banner of a multi-coloured mythical beast It would have seemed more tolerant.
[02:44:34.667 --> 02:44:44.973]  Several Tampa Bay baseball players opted out of displaying support for gay pride by refusing to wear Pride Night uniforms, citing their belief in Jesus Christ as the reason.
[02:44:45.013 --> 02:44:55.199]  They're trying to use religious exemptions to affect the opportunities, services, available resources for people who are LGBTQ+.
[02:44:55.779 --> 02:44:56.299]  Bravo.
[02:44:56.640 --> 02:45:00.242]  Wear the gay rights clothing or you're denying gay people their rights.
[02:45:00.503 --> 02:45:03.085]  It's no longer enough just to tolerate it.
[02:45:03.125 --> 02:45:05.546]  The regime demands you perform your loyalty oath.
[02:45:05.667 --> 02:45:07.928]  Remember, they're a marginalised community.
[02:45:08.108 --> 02:45:08.669]  On train.
[02:45:08.809 --> 02:45:10.770]  Pride event or something happening in Glasgow.
[02:45:10.810 --> 02:45:12.272]  Train full of pride attendees.
[02:45:12.472 --> 02:45:14.233]  Random girl handing out pride flags.
[02:45:14.593 --> 02:45:15.274]  Offers me one.
[02:45:15.554 --> 02:45:17.155]  Can't refuse because might be a hate crime.
[02:45:17.375 --> 02:45:19.237]  Can't throw it away because it might be a hate crime.
[02:45:19.477 --> 02:45:20.178]  Had to hold it.
[02:45:20.258 --> 02:45:21.098]  Literally 1984.
[02:45:21.839 --> 02:45:29.925]  We celebrate diversity by raising the Pride Progress flag for Pride Month at our HQ and to honour those who've championed for equality before us.
[02:45:29.945 --> 02:45:33.947]  We're monitoring our posts so all hate crime will be reported and investigated.
[02:45:34.028 --> 02:45:37.870]  But monitoring criminals who are stabbing people in the street in broad daylight?
[02:45:38.171 --> 02:45:39.051]  Not so much.
[02:45:42.702 --> 02:45:48.246]  BBC changed rape victims quotes to avoid misgendering her trans attacker.
[02:45:48.346 --> 02:45:49.267]  What if he rapes me?
[02:45:49.287 --> 02:45:51.448]  What if she rapes you?
[02:45:51.548 --> 02:45:55.911]  There you have it.
[02:45:56.291 --> 02:46:05.818]  Let's switch now to Europe news where we have continued fallout from the bedlam that occurred before the Champions League final in Paris a couple of weekends ago.
[02:46:06.610 --> 02:46:12.012]  Spain's Vox party warns of danger of multicultural hotspots after Champions League chaos.
[02:46:12.512 --> 02:46:16.173]  Of course, what happened before the game between Liverpool and Real Madrid in Paris?
[02:46:16.793 --> 02:46:38.102]   At the Stade de France, this heavily migrant area, Saint-Denis, Paris, where 400,000 illegal immigrants live, they saw the visiting supporters, football fans as easy prey, robbed them in some cases, stripped them of clothing, attacked them, The local French riot police in Paris responded by tear-gassing the innocent Liverpool supporters.
[02:46:38.402 --> 02:46:39.382]  There was a big cover-up.
[02:46:39.622 --> 02:46:46.546]  There was a poll of French people which found 76% of respondents did not believe the official story.
[02:46:46.967 --> 02:46:58.353]  Well, now we have the leader of the Spain's Vox party responding to that warning, quote, We still have time to prevent the Spanish cities of Acero, El Pulche or Sol from becoming Saint Denis.
[02:46:59.025 --> 02:47:09.810]  He went on to say, we need to protect the borders, end the pull effect for migrants, increase the police presence and the free social benefits buffet, and stop bowing our heads to political correctness.
[02:47:10.331 --> 02:47:26.819]  They're going to bring it in front of the European Parliament next year, next week, to try and get answers on what they're going to do about these migrant no-go zones, which you'll recall four years ago, five years ago, the media claimed did not even exist.
[02:47:27.560 --> 02:47:37.303]  Gonna come back on the other side, talk about the Jubilee, talk about what happened yesterday in Berlin with that strange vehicle attack on people in Germany.
[02:47:37.363 --> 02:47:37.924]  We'll be back.
[02:47:38.204 --> 02:47:39.184]  Summit.News.
[02:47:39.304 --> 02:47:39.864]  Don't go away.
[02:47:40.124 --> 02:47:53.289]  So we have a continuing cover-up over what happened before the Champions League final two weekends ago, where groups of migrant youths from the local area attacked supporters, visiting tourists, saw them as easy prey.
[02:47:53.889 --> 02:47:57.974]  The media covered it up, the police covered it up, they blamed Liverpool supporters.
[02:47:57.994 --> 02:48:03.119]  30,000 to 40,000 of them without tickets, completely made up out of thin air.
[02:48:03.980 --> 02:48:10.307]  Now we have this headline, Paris police chief says tear-gassing of football fans at Champions League final was a mistake.
[02:48:10.787 --> 02:48:16.233]  After it all came to light that they weren't responsible, they still won't admit who the true culprits were.
[02:48:16.929 --> 02:48:19.870]  Because that would prove that maybe diversity isn't a strength, of course.
[02:48:20.290 --> 02:48:31.053]  The Stade de France, in this heavily migrant area where 400,000 illegal immigrants live, is going to be host to the 2024 Olympics, so they've got major problems in the pipeline.
[02:48:31.673 --> 02:48:37.175]  Remix reports France three Algerian migrants arrested for slitting 70-year-old woman's throat.
[02:48:37.235 --> 02:48:40.056]  We continue to see stories like that on a daily basis.
[02:48:41.078 --> 02:48:59.497]  Then we had the strange incident in Germany yesterday, where what they called a German citizen who had Armenian migrant background, plowed a car into a group of people outside a cafe, went back onto the road, came back onto the pavement, smashed into a bunch of other people, smashed into a shop window.
[02:49:00.178 --> 02:49:10.913]   It subsequently emerged that they found political material in his vehicle, And yet now, 24 hours later, the official explanation is once again mental illness.
[02:49:10.953 --> 02:49:14.260]  This is the clip, the Berlin car attack.
[02:49:14.480 --> 02:49:15.062]  Let's roll it.
[02:49:15.612 --> 02:49:21.994]  A man in Berlin deliberately drove into crowds of people before smashing into a shop window in an apparent terrorist attack.
[02:49:22.114 --> 02:49:27.336]  One teacher was tragically killed, while at least 30 suffered injuries, some of them life-threatening.
[02:49:27.696 --> 02:49:30.177]  12 of the victims were on a student class trip.
[02:49:30.437 --> 02:49:36.679]  Actor John Barrowman, who was an eyewitness to the events, made clear that the killer deliberately targeted his victims.
[02:49:36.799 --> 02:49:39.861]  Quote, we are no experts, but this looks intentional, he said.
[02:49:39.961 --> 02:49:42.081]  By the way, the car went on the pavement.
[02:49:42.401 --> 02:49:43.082]  Up there...
[02:49:44.122 --> 02:49:46.603]  The car came down onto the pavement.
[02:49:46.683 --> 02:49:48.724]  We had dinner in that restaurant last night.
[02:49:49.464 --> 02:50:01.189]  The car came down onto the pavement, then has come onto the road over there, has hit somebody, then has gone down the road and come back onto the pavement down that way.
[02:50:03.790 --> 02:50:14.138]  And come back onto the pavement and gone through a bunch of people, gone through the photograph that I posted of a cafe and then right into a storefront window.
[02:50:14.258 --> 02:50:20.123]  British architect Scott Gill told Sky News, quote, You could see the car had zigzagged on and off the pavement on the way down.
[02:50:20.203 --> 02:50:30.811]  An apparent confession letter was subsequently found in the vehicle, although Berlin State Interior Minister Iris Sprenger disagreed with this description and said that placards had been found.
[02:50:30.871 --> 02:50:31.532]  What did they say?
[02:50:32.032 --> 02:50:34.094]  Authorities aren't revealing that at this time.
[02:50:34.154 --> 02:50:38.557]  German news outlet Bild reports that the documents found in the car related to Turkey.
[02:50:38.597 --> 02:50:45.582]  The suspect has been identified as Gore H, a man who obtained German citizenship but had an Armenian migrant background.
[02:50:45.642 --> 02:50:47.663]  Here's a clip of him being detained by police.
[02:50:48.384 --> 02:50:49.845]  What do you want from me?
[02:50:49.885 --> 02:50:52.707]  You almost killed me!
[02:50:52.747 --> 02:50:59.431]  I don't know if it's a Gypsy, a Bulgarian or a Romanian.
[02:50:59.491 --> 02:51:00.512]  It's an asshole.
[02:51:01.773 --> 02:51:10.935]  Although this incident doesn't look like it's Islamist related, the attack occurred at virtually the same site as the 2016 jihadist truck attack on a Christmas market.
[02:51:10.995 --> 02:51:19.056]  While the man's motivation remains unknown, Germany has been hit by similar violent attacks since it threw open its borders to mass migration in 2015.
[02:51:19.596 --> 02:51:39.836]   Despite this, the country's spy agency seems more interested in keeping tabs on right-wing Pegida demonstrators and anti-lockdown protesters After a Somali migrant went on a stabbing rampage that left three women dead in June last year, the mayor of Würzburg reacted by writing an open letter expressing concern about the stigmatization of refugees and migrants.
[02:51:39.915 --> 02:51:45.695]   The former director of Germany's foreign intelligence service accused former Chancellor Angela Merkel
[02:51:45.695 --> 02:51:51.094]   of creating a security crisis in Germany as a result of her open border refugee policy,
[02:51:51.094 --> 02:51:56.295]   with authorities clueless as to the identity of up to 300,000 people in the country.
[02:51:56.295 --> 02:52:00.254]   Despite previously admitting that multiculturalism had failed...
[02:52:00.256 --> 02:52:05.360]  Merkel claimed integrating the more than one million migrants who arrived in the past seven years had been a success.
[02:52:05.460 --> 02:52:18.969]  Although the victims of violent crimes in Germany, which have been soaring in recent years, and the over a thousand women who were molested in Cologne on New Year's Eve 2015 by gangs of North African migrants, will probably beg to differ.
[02:52:21.997 --> 02:52:22.537]  There you have it.
[02:52:22.577 --> 02:52:29.920]  Now, I want to get to this final video because, of course, we had the Queen's Platinum Jubilee here last weekend in the United Kingdom.
[02:52:30.380 --> 02:52:40.184]  The last vestigial gristle of acceptable patriotism that you're allowed to display is basically reverence for the royal family, for the Queen.
[02:52:40.204 --> 02:52:48.748]  I don't really care either way about them, but, you know, it was nice to see the British flags, the bunting flying high over the course of the past two weeks.
[02:52:49.386 --> 02:53:11.856]  It was also interesting to see the odious irony and hypocrisy from the left, the same people who for the past four, five, six years plus have celebratory flown EU flags, effusively flown Ukrainian flags, they're now of course flying gay pride flags while simultaneously calling you a quote, flag shagger.
[02:53:12.276 --> 02:53:15.701]  For flying the flag of our own country.
[02:53:16.002 --> 02:53:24.894]  But again, this video gets to the true narrative about why the Jubilee felt more like a wake than an actual celebration.
[02:53:24.954 --> 02:53:27.558]  Here is the clip, the strange Jubilee.
[02:53:27.618 --> 02:53:28.139]  Let's roll it.
[02:53:29.025 --> 02:53:40.588]  While I couldn't really give a toss about the Royal Family one way or the other, national respect for the institution itself and for the Queen is one of the last acceptable vestiges of British patriotism.
[02:53:40.668 --> 02:53:49.530]  I had no problem with the country basically taking half a week off to stage one huge civic-minded party, because God knows the last two years have been miserable enough.
[02:53:49.549 --> 02:53:55.709]   For usual suspects however, the same crowd who will deny until they're blue in the face that they hate the country
[02:53:55.709 --> 02:53:59.750]   in which they live, got noticeably more tetchy as the Platinum Jubilee
[02:53:59.750 --> 02:54:00.549]  approached.
[02:54:00.549 --> 02:54:08.039]   The same people in the UK who have been straining at the leash to fly EU flags for years and Ukraine flags for
[02:54:08.039 --> 02:54:12.049]   months, were suddenly deeply disturbed by the sight of the Union
[02:54:12.049 --> 02:54:14.049]  Jack, the flag of their own country.
[02:54:14.228 --> 02:54:20.214]  Some even compared it to a North Korean military parade or a Nazi rally in 1930s Berlin.
[02:54:20.294 --> 02:54:28.863]  Civic nationalists on the centre-right heralded the Jubilee as proof that Britain is a country where race is no longer a central feature of British national identity.
[02:54:28.883 --> 02:54:32.487]  Yet if you looked at pictures of crowds out celebrating the Jubilee...
[02:54:33.601 --> 02:54:35.562]  They weren't exactly very diverse.
[02:54:35.642 --> 02:54:42.385]  There was a shocking lack of diversity on display in London, where white Brits are now a minority in the capital of England.
[02:54:42.505 --> 02:54:47.226]  I haven't seen that many white people gathered in one place in London since Live Aid in 1985.
[02:54:48.167 --> 02:54:54.729]  Outside of London, the Jubilee was more warmly embraced in less diverse villages than it was in bigger towns.
[02:54:54.810 --> 02:54:59.812]  During a visit to a town on Saturday, I saw almost as many Ukraine flags as I did British.
[02:54:59.912 --> 02:55:06.762]   At the start of Jubilee week, residents of Nelson, Lancashire, We're expecting to see the Union flag flying over the town
[02:55:06.762 --> 02:55:10.951]   hall, only instead to see the Palestinian flag hoisted high.
[02:55:10.951 --> 02:55:16.881]   The town has a Muslim population of 37% and the person responsible for the decision to fly the
[02:55:16.881 --> 02:55:20.552]   Palestinian flag is Labour group leader Mohamed Iqbal.
[02:55:20.552 --> 02:55:25.451]   What was strange about the Jubilee, however, was that it didn't really feel like a celebration of
[02:55:25.451 --> 02:55:25.991]  Britain.
[02:55:25.991 --> 02:55:30.552]   More like a wake for a Britain that used to exist but is no longer with us.
[02:55:30.696 --> 02:55:40.663]  The plethora of Beatles tribute acts that played in shires and villages up and down the country only seemed to add to an atmosphere that felt more melancholy than carnival-like.
[02:55:40.763 --> 02:55:56.954]   The fact that we basically no longer have proper functioning borders and that Englishness and Britishness has been watered down to such an extent That most feel the need to constantly apologize for being English or British made the whole event come off more as a damp squib than a bawdy knees up.
[02:55:57.034 --> 02:56:09.282]  The rain that soaked the country on the final day of the commemoration was probably one of the only truly British things that will wholeheartedly survive if the Queen makes it to her next Jubilee in 10 years time.
[02:56:12.737 --> 02:56:22.920]  Now of course we have the media continuing to tell us that basically Russia is losing, they're about to collapse, Ukraine is winning, even as Russia apparently take over all these towns and different areas.
[02:56:23.640 --> 02:56:34.743]  But rest assured the Ukrainian government has found a way to completely and totally vanquish Putin's war machine once and for all.
[02:56:35.304 --> 02:56:42.927]   And it is to ban the 1869 historical novel classic By Tolstoy, War and Peace!
[02:56:43.787 --> 02:56:54.592]  Yes, Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace and other classical historical novels that portray the Russian military in anything other than a negative light will be banned from being taught in Ukrainian schools.
[02:56:54.612 --> 02:56:57.113]  They're going to make a list of books that need to be banned.
[02:56:57.594 --> 02:57:02.596]  They've already banned Siberian cats from performing in international cat competitions.
[02:57:02.656 --> 02:57:07.058]  They've banned Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing at Wimbledon.
[02:57:08.015 --> 02:57:13.600]  So this will definitely stop the onslaught of the Russian tanks.
[02:57:14.321 --> 02:57:20.346]  Meanwhile, Ukrainian official admits she lied about Russians committing mass rape to convince countries to send more weapons.
[02:57:20.907 --> 02:57:29.395]  When she made these claims at the time, CNN, Washington Post, a bunch of other legacy media outlets amplified it, reported on it as if it was gospel.
[02:57:29.995 --> 02:57:51.461]  Turned out that she was actually fired as a result of a vote in the Ukrainian Parliament by a vast margin of 234 to 9 because she pushed misinformation that the Ukrainian Parliament said quote only harmed Ukraine by falsely blaming Russian troops for the mass sexual assault of women and for child sexual abuses.
[02:57:51.801 --> 02:57:54.062]  She completely made it up out of thin air.
[02:57:54.402 --> 02:57:57.803]  Now she's out, but she said it to get the foreign countries to send the weapons.
[02:57:58.163 --> 02:58:00.683]  And that, at least in the short term, has worked.
[02:58:00.963 --> 02:58:02.484]  That's going to wrap it up for Summit.News.
[02:58:02.524 --> 02:58:03.604]  War Room is next.

[03:00:10.952 --> 03:00:17.555]  InfoWars has been selling a variety of Faraday cages to protect your privacy for more than 20 years.
[03:00:18.255 --> 03:00:30.161]  We were one of the first national talk shows to expose satellite tracking and how government corporations and hackers and other criminal groups are using it to steal your identity and sell your information.
[03:00:31.337 --> 03:00:44.545]  Everybody out there watching right now has had the apps and the phone companies and the big tech companies track your data, create a dossier, and sell it to hundreds, if not thousands, of different organizations.
[03:00:44.985 --> 03:00:50.689]  And they use this data to collectively screw over not just the people of America, but the people of the world.
[03:00:51.169 --> 03:00:54.751]  Now we've sold more than 10 different brands of Faraday cages.
[03:00:55.432 --> 03:00:58.254]  But a couple years ago I said, listen, I want high quality.
[03:00:58.974 --> 03:01:04.259]  Made in America systems that the military uses that are also very, very affordable.
[03:01:04.679 --> 03:01:10.885]  So we set out to find out who has the main contracts to supply the Pentagon, the FBI, and others.
[03:01:12.042 --> 03:01:13.883]  We finally made contact over a year ago.
[03:01:14.404 --> 03:01:18.206]  We put it in order more than six months ago, and they came in, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:01:19.067 --> 03:01:29.594]  We have 12 different sizes of high-quality Faraday cages for iPads, laptops, cell phones, big cell phones, little cell phones.
