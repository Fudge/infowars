[00:00.000 --> 00:16.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, Ron DeSantis gets it.
[00:16.240 --> 00:24.240]  Here he is yesterday during a press conference talking about how to deal with the corrupt
[00:24.240 --> 00:27.880]  liberal mainstream media.
[00:27.880 --> 00:35.240]  I am not deterred by any smear piece from these legacy media outlets.
[00:35.240 --> 00:39.000]  The only reason they're attacking her is because she does a great job and she's very
[00:39.000 --> 00:43.600]  effective at calling out their lies and their phony narratives.
[00:43.600 --> 00:48.880]  So whenever they're smearing somebody, you know that person is over the target.
[00:48.880 --> 00:50.320]  So they're scared of that.
[00:50.320 --> 00:55.720]  I would be much more concerned with my press secretary if the Washington Post was writing
[00:55.720 --> 00:56.720]  tough pieces about her.
[00:56.720 --> 01:02.720]  But then I would think something's going to go wrong.
[01:02.720 --> 01:07.560]  The thing that we don't even understand with these legacy DC New York outlets is we don't
[01:07.560 --> 01:14.120]  care what you think anymore, we know you pet on narratives, we know you lie, we know you
[01:14.120 --> 01:19.120]  don't care about the facts, and so you can try to smear me or anyone in my administration
[01:19.120 --> 01:20.520]  all you want to.
[01:20.520 --> 01:24.920]  All that's going to do is embolden us to continue moving forward for the people of
[01:24.920 --> 01:25.920]  Florida.
[01:25.920 --> 01:34.440]  So he said the important part already, we don't care what you think anymore.
[01:34.440 --> 01:42.880]  Now he's addressing the mainstream media there, the leftist media there, because they've
[01:42.880 --> 01:51.640]  been attacking his press secretary, Christina Pushaw, who's a wonderful lady, and DeSantis,
[01:51.640 --> 01:54.960]  Pushaw and the rest just are unfazed, and that's why he comes out and he says, look,
[01:54.960 --> 01:56.160]  we don't care what you say anymore.
[01:56.160 --> 02:03.920]  Now that is the correct leap to take right now, and he's landed safely on the stone.
[02:03.920 --> 02:08.480]  But there's still one more stone and one more leap to take to complete this process because
[02:08.480 --> 02:14.120]  it's understanding that the leftist liberal mainstream media is the Democrat Party.
[02:14.120 --> 02:17.200]  They are Democrat Party activists, it's all one and the same.
[02:17.200 --> 02:23.280]  It's all one corrupt body of criminal behavior set to destroy America.
[02:23.280 --> 02:24.520]  That's their goal.
[02:24.520 --> 02:26.040]  That's why Obama is their leader.
[02:26.040 --> 02:29.840]  That's why he was influenced by the Weather Underground and Bill Ayers and Kathy Boudin.
[02:29.840 --> 02:33.520]  No, people are starting to learn about now because of Chesa Boudin's recall.
[02:33.520 --> 02:38.280]  But see, once you realize that the mainstream media and the Democrat Party is all the same,
[02:38.280 --> 02:41.280]  and once you take that same approach of we don't care what you say anymore, we don't
[02:41.280 --> 02:44.760]  care what you think anymore, that's victory.
[02:44.760 --> 02:46.760]  That's the path to victory.
[02:46.760 --> 02:50.400]  Stop letting these liars, stop letting these crooks, stop letting these criminals, stop
[02:50.400 --> 02:55.760]  letting these scumbags dictate how we think, how we feel based off the threats that they
[02:55.760 --> 03:03.040]  may have or based off their big mainstream media hit pieces that they may put out.
[03:03.040 --> 03:05.320]  That's the correct approach to take mentally.
[03:05.320 --> 03:09.800]  We don't care what you say, we don't care what you print, we don't care what you think.
[03:09.800 --> 03:14.000]  You're the scumbags, we're the good guys, we're going to go on doing what we're doing
[03:14.000 --> 03:16.840]  here to save this country and help Americans out.
[03:16.840 --> 03:23.080]  You keep doing what you're doing, which is the criminal deception and lying to the American
[03:23.080 --> 03:25.080]  people.
[03:25.080 --> 03:29.520]  So we're almost there, folks, and I think the Santis is now really, to me, starting
[03:29.520 --> 03:35.480]  to make leaps and bounds over even Donald Trump as we move towards the midterms and
[03:35.480 --> 03:38.080]  into the next presidential election.
[03:38.080 --> 03:41.520]  But there's a candidate, Trump endorsed Blake Masters, who understands this.
[03:41.520 --> 03:44.800]  Now, they're lying about what happened at this event.
[03:44.800 --> 03:49.160]  A deranged leftist showed up to protest at a Blake Masters event.
[03:49.160 --> 03:53.360]  And here's the video of that, and I'll tell you what really happened and how he was
[03:53.360 --> 03:54.360]  lied about in the media.
[03:54.360 --> 04:20.400]  And so a deranged leftist went to a Blake Masters event and started causing trouble,
[04:20.400 --> 04:22.320]  and he shoved a woman.
[04:22.320 --> 04:25.960]  And so, of course, the media said they attacked Blake Masters and they said, oh, look, Blake
[04:25.960 --> 04:29.520]  Masters attacked 73-year-old man while Blake Masters is such a bad guy.
[04:29.520 --> 04:31.280]  Well, turns out they got it wrong again.
[04:31.280 --> 04:38.640]  Actually, that 73-year-old man was a sex offender, he's a sex offender, and he actually shoved
[04:38.640 --> 04:42.080]  a elderly woman before anything happened.
[04:42.080 --> 04:45.240]  So yeah, the media lied about Blake Masters, they got it wrong again.
[04:45.240 --> 04:49.160]  Blake Masters doesn't care what lying corrupt criminal Democrats say, he doesn't care about
[04:49.160 --> 04:50.160]  the mainstream media.
[04:50.160 --> 04:55.880]  He's here for Blake Masters for protecting an innocent old lady from a deranged sexual
[04:55.880 --> 04:58.960]  abuser leftist that tried to crash his event.
[04:58.960 --> 05:06.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, high quality, storeable food is back in stock, ready to ship right
[05:06.160 --> 05:07.160]  now.
[05:07.160 --> 05:10.880]  We've not been selling food for three months because it was taking several weeks for the
[05:10.880 --> 05:13.040]  food to get packaged and delivered to you.
[05:13.040 --> 05:17.280]  Most of their companies are completely out, but now they have a large spectrum of high
[05:17.280 --> 05:19.600]  quality food ready to ship.
[05:19.600 --> 05:25.080]  All you find at PrepareWithAlex.com or PrepareToDay.com is in stock, ready to ship.

[05:30.040 --> 05:32.040]  right now, ready to ship to you and your family.
[05:32.040 --> 05:36.040]  With the inflation happening, with the food shortages, with the wars, with the collapse
[05:36.040 --> 05:37.200]  and wars, everything's happening.
[05:37.200 --> 05:40.720]  It's one of the most important things you can make is to have high quality, storeable
[05:40.720 --> 05:44.480]  food, water filtration, air filtration, and more, and it's not just those items, it's
[05:44.480 --> 05:49.080]  hundreds of other high quality, preparedness items and survival items right now at Prepare
[05:49.080 --> 05:54.080]  WithAlex.com that again redirects to PrepareToday.com.
[05:54.080 --> 05:57.040]  I would not procrastinate, ladies and gentlemen, one of the most important things you can do
[05:57.040 --> 06:26.520]  is get ahead of inflation now because inflation is just beginning.
[06:27.040 --> 06:41.680]  Wow, here we are on this Thursday, June 9th, 2022, and the Democrats are about to have
[06:41.680 --> 06:48.520]  their sham hearings tonight, about January 6th, a made for TV event, an event, a movie
[06:48.520 --> 06:54.000]  if you will, almost two years in the making, Democrats have done everything they possibly
[06:54.000 --> 07:00.840]  could in the last year and a half to drum up and create as much evidence that they possibly
[07:00.840 --> 07:05.920]  can, they have none, so they have to go through millions of texts and emails and everything
[07:05.920 --> 07:10.560]  from thousands of different individuals, of which I'm sure they'll cherry pick three or
[07:10.560 --> 07:15.960]  four out of and say, see, look at this, take it totally out of context to prove their point.
[07:15.960 --> 07:20.440]  They'll probably find someone in the Proud Boys, you know, using a racial slur or something
[07:20.440 --> 07:27.480]  like that, they'll say, look, they're racist, and of course, they scrubbed the thousands
[07:27.480 --> 07:33.320]  of hours of video footage from the Capitol that day that shows it was Antifa breaking
[07:33.320 --> 07:38.240]  into the Capitol, smashing the windows, getting into confrontations with police, breaking down
[07:38.240 --> 07:43.160]  the barriers before any Trump supporters went over barriers.
[07:43.160 --> 07:51.520]  It was Antifa that first had that push, but okay, we all know that story, we all know
[07:51.520 --> 07:55.800]  the big lies, we all know everybody that died on January 6th was Trump supporters killed
[07:55.800 --> 08:04.080]  by police, so we can rehash that as much as possible, but imagine that now, you don't
[08:04.080 --> 08:13.120]  have to imagine, that juxtaposed with what we just had yesterday where a Democrat went
[08:13.120 --> 08:23.080]  to Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's house to assassinate him.
[08:23.080 --> 08:28.000]  So Democrats are having their sham January 6th hearing tonight as Democrats are out in
[08:28.000 --> 08:33.920]  front of Supreme Court Justice's house trying to murder them, and they're telling you that
[08:33.920 --> 08:39.560]  Republicans and Trump and white people are the problem as they're literally the most
[08:39.560 --> 08:45.400]  violent terrorists in the country, and you know, I don't want to belabor this point because
[08:45.400 --> 08:51.080]  I really need to cover this news sufficiently today, but there's something that needs to
[08:51.080 --> 08:57.720]  be understood about the modern day Democrat Party, and I'm really not sure where Biden
[08:57.720 --> 09:03.100]  falls into this other than just being a total puppet, I'm really not sure where Pelosi falls
[09:03.100 --> 09:13.360]  into this other than just being a total criminal, but what is actually happening now in the
[09:13.360 --> 09:22.080]  Democrat Party is that violent radical revolutionaries have taken control of the party, and Barack
[09:22.080 --> 09:26.000]  Hussein Obama is the leader.
[09:26.000 --> 09:34.920]  Barack Hussein Obama was influenced by radical communists and terrorists like Kathy Boudin
[09:34.920 --> 09:36.600]  and Bill Ayers.
[09:36.600 --> 09:42.040]  Barack Obama launched his political campaign from the wings of the Weather Underground,
[09:42.040 --> 09:47.120]  a known terrorist group that robbed banks, killed police officers, and burned buildings
[09:47.120 --> 09:49.360]  to the ground.
[09:49.360 --> 09:55.760]  That is the cloth, that is the thread that Barack Obama comes from, and that is now where
[09:55.760 --> 10:01.360]  all the ideology of the Democrat Party is trickling down from.
[10:01.360 --> 10:06.720]  And so that's why you're seeing the Democrats and the liberal left become more anti-American,
[10:06.720 --> 10:10.560]  more communist, more criminal, more terroristic than ever before.
[10:10.560 --> 10:17.440]  That's the Obama effect, that's the Boudin effect, that's the Weather Underground effect.
[10:17.440 --> 10:24.400]  Now everything I've just said to you is fact, folks.
[10:24.400 --> 10:32.080]  So that needs to be understood, and Obama's really running by, and I think, or in some
[10:32.080 --> 10:37.800]  way shape or form, he is running a lot of the White House policy right now.
[10:37.800 --> 10:42.360]  But so let's come back to where we're at today.
[10:42.360 --> 10:50.120]  Just hours after a Democrat terrorist was arrested outside of Brett Kavanaugh's house
[10:50.120 --> 10:57.160]  attempting to assassinate a Supreme Court justice, Democrats sent another hundred protesters
[10:57.160 --> 11:04.400]  out in front of Kavanaugh's house and in front of Justice Roberts' house.
[11:04.400 --> 11:07.880]  And that footage is right there on the screen for you.
[11:07.880 --> 11:15.440]  So even after the terrorist gets caught, the Democrat terrorist gets caught after trying
[11:15.440 --> 11:21.640]  to assassinate a Supreme Court justice, the Democrats still go outside of his house and
[11:21.640 --> 11:26.360]  go outside of other Supreme Court justices' house, raising their ruckus, making their
[11:26.360 --> 11:31.440]  threats and doing their normal activity.
[11:31.440 --> 11:38.960]  Now can you imagine if on January 7th, 2021, Trump supporters decided to go back to the
[11:38.960 --> 11:44.040]  Capitol, could you imagine the uproar and the outrage?
[11:44.040 --> 11:48.880]  Of course, Trump supporters left the Capitol that day when they were asked to and told
[11:48.880 --> 11:51.000]  to.
[11:51.000 --> 11:54.680]  But oh, Democrat terrorist gets caught trying to assassinate the Supreme Court justice.
[11:54.680 --> 11:56.000]  What's the Democrat response?
[11:56.000 --> 11:57.600]  Send more.
[11:57.600 --> 11:58.840]  Send reinforcements.
[11:58.840 --> 11:59.840]  Send backup.
[11:59.840 --> 12:00.840]  Don't stop.
[12:00.840 --> 12:03.680]  Keep up the pressure.
[12:03.680 --> 12:07.960]  And we've got all kinds of examples, Nancy Pelosi calling for violence, Maxine Waters
[12:07.960 --> 12:13.680]  calling for violence, Laurie Lightfoot calling for violence, Joe Biden calling for violence.
[12:13.680 --> 12:18.120]  And this is just their own logic.
[12:18.120 --> 12:19.600]  This is just their own words.
[12:19.600 --> 12:20.720]  This is just their own rhetoric.
[12:20.720 --> 12:23.640]  This is just their own activity.
[12:23.640 --> 12:33.200]  But you now live in the America where Democrats are allowed to be openly domestic terrorists
[12:33.200 --> 12:38.960]  and conservatives aren't even allowed to open their mouth, where you have hundreds of political
[12:38.960 --> 12:43.640]  prisoners being held by the Democrat Party right now just for a political stunt ruining
[12:43.640 --> 12:50.920]  people's lives as they send their own people out to terrorize and murder their political
[12:50.920 --> 12:53.920]  opposition.
[12:53.920 --> 12:55.800]  Who killed Ashley Babbitt?
[12:55.800 --> 12:57.400]  Who killed the Trump supporter in Portland?
[12:57.400 --> 12:59.680]  Who killed the Trump supporter in Denver?
[12:59.680 --> 13:02.200]  Who is James Hodgkinson?
[13:02.200 --> 13:08.680]  See, the Democrat media doesn't make a big thing of these stories, do they?
[13:08.680 --> 13:11.680]  The Democrat media doesn't want you to know about their terrorists.
[13:11.680 --> 13:13.480]  Remember the Waukesha massacre?
[13:13.480 --> 13:14.600]  They buried that.
[13:14.600 --> 13:16.040]  Remember the Tulsa mass shooting?
[13:16.040 --> 13:18.240]  They buried that.
[13:18.240 --> 13:20.240]  Why?
[13:20.240 --> 13:22.640]  Because that's their people.
[13:22.640 --> 13:30.960]  They don't want you to know that their people are violent and radical and terroristic.
[13:30.960 --> 13:39.280]  And unfortunately, we have been warning that this is coming for a long time.
[13:39.280 --> 13:40.800]  I studied psychology.
[13:40.800 --> 13:45.080]  It was actually something that was very interesting to me in college.
[13:45.080 --> 13:49.960]  I really enjoyed it and I can tell you, I know the psychology of the left.
[13:49.960 --> 13:51.880]  It's dangerous, folks.
[13:51.880 --> 14:00.200]  And I've been warning, I've been warning for months, if not years, the radical leftists
[14:00.200 --> 14:05.800]  that share the roads with us and share restaurants and banks and everything else, share this
[14:05.800 --> 14:11.280]  country with us, they are just one little shove away from going off the deep end and
[14:11.280 --> 14:14.600]  going completely mental and completely psychotic.
[14:14.600 --> 14:19.640]  And what we saw yesterday with the attempted assassination of Brett Kavanaugh is just one
[14:19.640 --> 14:26.400]  example of many and many to come.
[14:26.400 --> 14:30.880]  And here's some of the rhetoric from the Democrats like Biden last night with Jimmy
[14:30.880 --> 14:31.880]  Kimmel.
[14:31.880 --> 14:36.880]  Biden predicts mini-revolution in November if SCOTUS overturns Roe v. Wade.
[14:36.880 --> 14:38.360]  Oh, is that insurrection?
[14:38.360 --> 14:41.840]  Oh, no, Democrats are allowed to say whatever they want.
[14:41.840 --> 14:44.400]  Only Trump supporters need to shut their mouths.
[14:44.400 --> 14:45.400]  Pull.
[14:45.400 --> 14:49.160]  Nearly half of younger Democrat men think assassinating a politician is okay.
[14:49.160 --> 14:52.320]  Boy, where would they get that idea?
[14:52.320 --> 14:53.600]  Where would they get that idea?
[14:53.600 --> 14:54.600]  Oh, I don't know.
[14:54.600 --> 15:00.560]  Johnnie Depp insinuating they assassinate Trump and the New York theater depicting the
[15:00.560 --> 15:06.520]  assassination of Trump night after night after night and Kathy Griffin holding up the decapitated
[15:06.520 --> 15:08.120]  Trump head.
[15:08.120 --> 15:13.600]  Where would the radical, terroristic left get this idea that it's okay to assassinate
[15:13.600 --> 15:14.920]  their political opposition?
[15:14.920 --> 15:18.320]  I can't figure it out, I guess.
[15:18.320 --> 15:23.120]  And then as the Democrats are sending their terrorists to the Supreme Court Justice's
[15:23.120 --> 15:27.800]  House, they're also blocking bills providing additional security for Supreme Court Justices.
[15:27.800 --> 15:28.800]  Yes.
[15:28.800 --> 15:31.000]  Not even kidding you.
[15:31.000 --> 15:35.920]  Democrats send a terrorist to Brett Kavanaugh's house to kill him.
[15:35.920 --> 15:41.680]  Republicans propose legislation that we send extra security to Supreme Court Justice's
[15:41.680 --> 15:46.160]  House because an assassin just went to one of them and Democrats say, uh-uh, and they
[15:46.160 --> 15:50.800]  block that bill and then they send a hundred more radical leftists out to Supreme Court
[15:50.800 --> 15:53.640]  Justice's House.
[15:53.640 --> 15:55.240]  What more do you need to know about these people?
[15:55.240 --> 15:57.360]  What, how much further must they go?
[15:57.360 --> 16:00.600]  How many more must die?
[16:00.600 --> 16:03.880]  PrepareToday.com.

[17:13.400 --> 17:18.480]  each other, so we can spread the word, and so we can push people to websites like InfoWars.com
[17:18.480 --> 17:21.480]  so they can understand the globalist plan and how to stop it.
[17:21.480 --> 17:24.680]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, two months ago we announced we're blowing out of all of our
[17:24.680 --> 17:28.440]  designs of t-shirts, some of which go back more than 25 years.

[17:32.160 --> 17:34.560]  in your closet, your drawer, or your wardrobe.
[17:34.560 --> 17:39.360]  So, there's only 15,000 shirts of 60 plus thousand left, and a couple weeks they'll
[17:39.360 --> 17:45.880]  all be gone, and they'll be history, we're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.

[18:08.840 --> 18:13.400]  caught flat footed during their major takeover, is because of you.

[20:28.400 --> 20:35.400]  Biden predicts a mini-revolution in November if SCOTUS overturns Roe v. Wade.
[20:35.400 --> 20:37.720]  And what would that mini-revolution look like?
[20:37.720 --> 20:42.640]  Democrat terrorists assassinating Supreme Court justices like they tried yesterday?
[20:42.640 --> 20:49.840]  Poll nearly half of young Democrat men think assassination is okay.
[20:49.840 --> 20:54.080]  This is not your father's Democrat party.
[20:54.080 --> 20:56.680]  This is Obama's Democrat party.
[20:56.680 --> 21:03.680]  People raging communist anti-American revolutionaries that want to burn this country to the ground.
[21:06.280 --> 21:09.800]  Democrats block Bill providing additional security for Supreme Court justices.
[21:09.800 --> 21:12.120]  Imagine how evil the Democrats are.
[21:12.120 --> 21:14.400]  They lie about the Supreme Court justices.
[21:14.400 --> 21:17.800]  They then publish and promote their private addresses.
[21:17.800 --> 21:23.360]  They then send their protestors, violent protestors to their private addresses.
[21:23.360 --> 21:29.280]  Everyone attempts to kill a Supreme Court justice and then they block the bill to have
[21:29.280 --> 21:32.920]  extra security there and they also want to disarm civilians.
[21:32.920 --> 21:36.760]  Yeah, they want to be able to come kill whoever they want at their house whenever they want
[21:36.760 --> 21:37.760]  to.
[21:37.760 --> 21:40.280]  That's what it's all about.
[21:40.280 --> 21:45.760]  Why do you think they want to disarm civilians and disarm police so that when they want to
[21:45.760 --> 21:51.800]  kill their political opposition they can do it with no resistance whatsoever?
[21:51.800 --> 21:58.800]  Which yes, your assumption is correct there, they do want to kill their political opposition.
[22:00.400 --> 22:05.520]  And so we've got all kinds of clips here.
[22:05.520 --> 22:07.960]  In fact, we have the Chuck Schumer clip.
[22:07.960 --> 22:11.760]  I don't know if it's on my list today, but we should probably play that one again too.
[22:11.760 --> 22:13.560]  But here's Nancy Pelosi.
[22:13.560 --> 22:14.640]  This is only a month ago.
[22:14.640 --> 22:16.840]  This was only a month ago.
[22:16.840 --> 22:23.840]  Here is Nancy Pelosi on MSNBC encouraging people to influence the Supreme Court.
[22:25.440 --> 22:26.280]  Clip two.
[22:26.280 --> 22:30.200]  I think a right now crisis for a lot of women in this country, what do we do for them right
[22:30.200 --> 22:31.200]  now?
[22:31.200 --> 22:34.840]  Yes, I think we have, I think you're absolutely right.
[22:34.840 --> 22:41.840]  We have to be, have a clarity in what this draft decision means so that the final decision
[22:43.520 --> 22:45.240]  doesn't go that far.
[22:45.240 --> 22:50.480]  The Chief Justice has said this is authentic, but it is not final.
[22:50.480 --> 22:53.800]  I don't think it's authentic, it's real, but not final.
[22:53.800 --> 22:59.440]  So again, Lincoln said public sentiment is everything, with it you can accomplish almost
[22:59.440 --> 23:03.240]  anything without it, nothing, and women just have to weigh in.
[23:03.240 --> 23:08.320]  I don't think there's a good outcome here, but I think there's a better outcome than
[23:08.320 --> 23:11.920]  what we have seen in the first draft, which is radical.
[23:11.920 --> 23:15.680]  And this is, I think, a right now.
[23:15.680 --> 23:18.720]  And then, I don't know where it is in my stack here.
[23:18.720 --> 23:25.560]  You've got Lori Lightfoot, guys, I sent you the tweet, I can't find it in my stack, but
[23:25.560 --> 23:32.560]  Lori Lightfoot literally said, it's time for a call to arms, a call to arms over rover's
[23:34.480 --> 23:40.480]  weight, a call to arms.
[23:40.480 --> 23:47.480]  Now, look, do I believe that Nancy Pelosi or Joe Biden or Lori Lightfoot can be held
[23:49.440 --> 23:56.440]  criminally responsible for a deranged lunatic who obviously took their advice and went to
[23:57.560 --> 23:59.320]  try to kill Brett Kavanaugh?
[23:59.320 --> 24:06.000]  No, no, I believe that they have a right to free speech, but you see, if they're going
[24:06.000 --> 24:12.440]  to say that Donald Trump senior and Donald Trump junior and Alex Jones calling for peace
[24:12.440 --> 24:17.720]  on January 6th is violence, then Democrats calling for violence and then violence happening
[24:17.720 --> 24:23.680]  is certainly terroristic.
[24:23.680 --> 24:28.040]  But let's not forget Chuck Schumer, let's not forget old Chucky Schumer and his threats
[24:28.040 --> 24:32.600]  to Kavanaugh as well.
[24:32.600 --> 24:39.600]  I want to tell you Gorsuch, I want to tell you Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind
[24:39.680 --> 24:46.200]  and you will pay the price.
[24:46.200 --> 24:51.240]  You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.
[24:51.240 --> 24:55.840]  Yeah, you won't know what hit you, it'll be a Democrat pulling the trigger and a bullet,
[24:55.840 --> 24:57.520]  that's what'll hit you.
[24:57.520 --> 25:04.520]  Man, oh man, man, oh man, so we had the clip of Ron DeSantis earlier starting to understand
[25:05.720 --> 25:09.120]  is, hey, we don't care what you say about us anymore, you can print hit pieces on me
[25:09.120 --> 25:12.000]  all day long, I don't care, here's Lori Lightfoot.
[25:12.000 --> 25:16.960]  To my friends in the LGBTQ plus community, the Supreme Court is coming for us next, this
[25:16.960 --> 25:20.160]  moment has to be a call to arms.
[25:20.160 --> 25:26.120]  Call to arms, what, thought you wanted to disarm us, do you think the guy that tried
[25:26.120 --> 25:30.600]  to assassinate Brett Kavanaugh, do you think he read that Lori Lightfoot tweet?
[25:30.600 --> 25:34.680]  Do you think he took that to heart and went out and tried to commit a political assassination
[25:34.680 --> 25:39.360]  because Lori Lightfoot's tweet?
[25:39.360 --> 25:44.440]  Will there be an investigation, will there be hearings, will there be end to end wire
[25:44.440 --> 25:46.040]  to wire news coverage?
[25:46.040 --> 25:50.160]  Of course not, it's a Democrat.
[25:50.160 --> 25:56.600]  You see, it's not just understanding, it's time to quit caring what these crooks, criminals,
[25:56.600 --> 26:00.320]  liars, deceivers think about us.
[26:00.320 --> 26:05.480]  It's also time to have the understanding, and this is not a new phenomenon, folks, this
[26:05.480 --> 26:11.240]  has been the case for a long, long time, to have the understanding that the biggest domestic
[26:11.240 --> 26:15.840]  terror group in this country and the biggest hate group in this country and probably it's,
[26:15.840 --> 26:22.920]  our country's history is the Democrat Party, is the Democrat Party.
[26:22.920 --> 26:28.600]  From the weather underground to 60 million aborted babies, there is no more violent,
[26:28.600 --> 26:30.880]  deadly group than the Democrat Party.
[26:30.880 --> 26:36.800]  And now, because of a tragedy that happened, where kids died, very sad, which looks more
[26:36.800 --> 26:41.640]  than anything to be a police stand down, I don't know how else you would describe it
[26:41.640 --> 26:42.640]  at this point.
[26:42.640 --> 26:46.680]  The investigations are ongoing, not that I trust the investigations, but police stand
[26:46.680 --> 26:50.160]  down, good guy with a gun has to go in.
[26:50.160 --> 26:53.800]  If, I mean, think about the irony of that.
[26:53.800 --> 26:58.840]  Democrats are calling to take your firearms after the tragedy in Uvalde, but if it wasn't
[26:58.840 --> 27:03.080]  for citizens having a gun, there could have been 30 dead, 40 dead.
[27:03.080 --> 27:10.240]  If it wasn't for a citizen having a gun, there would have been more bloodshed in Uvalde.
[27:10.240 --> 27:13.120]  Now, that's because of the police stand down.
[27:13.120 --> 27:14.120]  The police didn't go in the building.
[27:14.120 --> 27:15.280]  The police didn't stop the shooting.
[27:15.280 --> 27:19.520]  So a good guy, a citizen with a gun had to go in and do it himself that he got from a
[27:19.520 --> 27:20.520]  barber shop.
[27:20.520 --> 27:23.920]  It happened to have one.
[27:23.920 --> 27:29.600]  So they use this tragedy for their political agenda to disarm the American people.
[27:29.600 --> 27:31.160]  They don't care about the second amendment.
[27:31.160 --> 27:34.760]  They'll get rid of the second amendment if they can.
[27:34.760 --> 27:40.520]  The Democrats will get rid of all the systems, the checks and balances, the rights.
[27:40.520 --> 27:44.480]  They will get rid of all those systems in this country if they have their way.
[27:44.480 --> 27:46.080]  They'll stack the court.
[27:46.080 --> 27:48.920]  They'll cancel elections.
[27:48.920 --> 27:52.600]  They've already told you, Biden has already said, the Bill of Rights is not absolute.
[27:52.600 --> 27:54.880]  Joe Biden told you the Bill of Rights is not absolute.
[27:54.880 --> 27:56.720]  That's treason.
[27:56.720 --> 28:00.720]  But yet, where is the Republican Party?
[28:00.720 --> 28:03.400]  Have you heard anything from Mitch McConnell?
[28:03.400 --> 28:04.840]  No.
[28:04.840 --> 28:09.360]  Have articles of impeachment been filed against Joe Biden for, you could have a hundred different
[28:09.360 --> 28:10.360]  reasons?
[28:10.360 --> 28:11.520]  No.
[28:11.520 --> 28:16.640]  Are Republicans doing big made for TV events or big hearings or big shows or anything in
[28:16.640 --> 28:19.680]  front of the Capitol or the Supreme Court or anything?
[28:19.680 --> 28:20.680]  No.
[28:20.680 --> 28:21.680]  No.
[28:21.680 --> 28:23.640]  You've got the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis.
[28:23.640 --> 28:25.800]  You've got Marjorie Taylor Greene.
[28:25.800 --> 28:26.800]  You've got Lauren Boeber.
[28:26.800 --> 28:27.800]  You've got Matt Gaetz.
[28:27.800 --> 28:29.360]  You've got Paul Gosar.
[28:29.360 --> 28:32.520]  You've got Rand Paul.
[28:32.520 --> 28:35.880]  That's pretty much it.
[28:35.880 --> 28:36.880]  That's pretty much it.
[28:36.880 --> 28:41.000]  It's pretty pathetic, isn't it?
[28:41.000 --> 28:46.360]  And yet, here we are again, another turn of the calendar.
[28:46.360 --> 28:51.360]  And the fact will remain, the biggest domestic terror group in this country and the biggest
[28:51.360 --> 28:59.960]  hate group in this country and the biggest threat to this country is the Democrat Party.
[28:59.960 --> 29:05.600]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones was right.
[29:05.600 --> 29:07.040]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[29:07.040 --> 29:11.320]  Well, it's actually a very sick feeling because I knew this was coming.
[29:11.320 --> 29:13.000]  I tried to stop it.
[29:13.000 --> 29:17.920]  And now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever because
[29:17.920 --> 29:23.080]  the globalists aren't hiding anymore in policy reports and documents.
[29:23.080 --> 29:24.680]  It's now out in the open.
[29:24.680 --> 29:30.280]  Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg group founded Davos
[29:30.280 --> 29:31.280]  Group.
[29:31.280 --> 29:34.280]  So now the fight's out in the open.
[29:34.280 --> 29:37.480]  They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[29:37.480 --> 29:38.480]  We're going to win this thing.
[29:38.480 --> 29:39.480]  God's watching.
[29:39.480 --> 29:40.480]  The children are counting on us.
[29:40.480 --> 29:44.120]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and
[29:44.120 --> 29:47.640]  your financial support because without you, info wars would not be here.
[29:47.640 --> 29:51.960]  I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are the
[29:51.960 --> 29:54.240]  reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[29:54.240 --> 29:58.760]  I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble
[29:58.760 --> 30:28.280]  your efforts.
[30:28.280 --> 30:56.280]  Thank you.
[30:59.280 --> 31:04.200]  I want to take a minute out to address the viewers and listeners of info wars and to
[31:04.200 --> 31:08.880]  remind you that we've been vindicated and that world government and its tyrannical
[31:08.880 --> 31:12.720]  aim of depopulation is now out of the open.
[31:12.720 --> 31:17.400]  Everything you and I have done together has been historic and we cannot continue in this
[31:17.400 --> 31:19.200]  fight without your support.
[31:19.200 --> 31:23.320]  I want to encourage you all to be part of history right now while you still can to get

[33:29.840 --> 33:35.040]  When biden uh can't figure out how to help america but he spent some time with jimmy
[33:35.040 --> 33:41.040]  kimmel last night by the way when he was boarding his plane they shot it in the afternoon

[33:53.640 --> 33:56.960]  deal out of that because it wasn't as bad as the time he fell four or five times or
[33:56.960 --> 34:01.160]  whatever and he took a little spill but it wasn't that big of a deal but he can barely
[34:01.160 --> 34:06.520]  walk he's got parkinsons probably and and dementia and all kinds of other things but
[34:06.520 --> 34:11.200]  no he went on kimmel and uh it's uh it's really just sick stuff isn't it it's really just
[34:11.200 --> 34:16.080]  sick stuff but hey jimmy kimmel is a voice mouth he's a a voice box he's the mouthpiece
[34:16.080 --> 34:20.680]  for the democrat party that's his job that's how he got the job he agreed to do the to
[34:20.680 --> 34:25.480]  be the the spokesperson unofficially for the democrat party hosting a late night show so
[34:25.480 --> 34:28.520]  yeah they're gonna give him the president of the united states as a big guest and a
[34:28.520 --> 34:34.120]  little scratch scratch our backs together and so here's some of those clips joe biden
[34:34.120 --> 34:38.320]  thinks it's funny or maybe he doesn't even know what's going on he makes a joke about
[34:38.320 --> 34:43.520]  throwing his political opponents in jail yeah that's real funny isn't it as uh you actually
[34:43.520 --> 34:49.400]  do have political prisoners joe here it is clip 17 look the republicans don't play in
[34:49.400 --> 34:54.000]  square why do you play in square oh my god well guess what if we do the same thing they
[34:54.000 --> 35:01.480]  do our democracy would literally be in jeopardy well yeah i understand their argument but
[35:01.480 --> 35:06.800]  also it's like you're playing monopoly with somebody who you know won't pass go won't
[35:06.800 --> 35:11.680]  follow any of the rules and how do you ever make any progress if they're not following
[35:11.680 --> 35:21.040]  the rules i gotta send the jail uh you know directly to jail directly to jail oh republicans
[35:21.040 --> 35:26.520]  don't play by the rules really uh we just caught another democrat uh stuffing the ballot
[35:26.520 --> 35:34.480]  box in pennsylvania so democrats have been caught in texas arizona new mexico pennsylvania
[35:34.480 --> 35:41.520]  michigan stuffing ballot boxes cheating in elections oh republicans don't play it fair
[35:41.520 --> 35:47.560]  really who's censoring the opposition on social media oh republicans don't play it fair did
[35:47.560 --> 35:54.480]  hunter biden go to jail when he broke gun laws no i mean just just unbelievable lies
[35:54.480 --> 35:58.120]  coming from joe biden and they just sit there they just clap and they laugh it off as they're
[35:58.120 --> 36:04.000]  trying to conquer and destroy this country how does that make you feel here's biden this
[36:04.000 --> 36:08.520]  is another hilarious one folks they it's only white people you only see white people on
[36:08.520 --> 36:20.960]  tv ads you know that turn on the tv look at the ads when's the last time you saw biracial
[36:20.960 --> 36:25.840]  couples on tv when's the last time you saw the way i mean people are selling products
[36:25.840 --> 36:30.680]  they do ads to sell products and they sell products when people they appeal to people
[36:30.680 --> 36:36.240]  this generation is gonna change everything we just got to make sure we don't give up
[36:36.240 --> 36:42.520]  there's an ability for us to do everything from increase the access to education health
[36:42.520 --> 36:47.080]  care look what we did in health care all all the yeah what you do in health care is a complete
[36:47.080 --> 36:52.720]  disaster but see he he he's he accidentally just told you the agenda they're targeting
[36:52.720 --> 36:57.080]  children with all their propaganda they're targeting children with their gun propaganda
[36:57.080 --> 37:01.840]  they're targeting children with their sex propaganda because that's that's what that's
[37:01.840 --> 37:06.080]  what hitler did hitler said give me the youth of the nation i'll rule that nation in seven
[37:06.080 --> 37:11.040]  years that's that's the democrats that's joe biden taking hitler's advice so that's why
[37:11.040 --> 37:14.000]  they target the children with gun control that's why they target the children to make
[37:14.000 --> 37:19.400]  them gay and everything else make them sexual deviants because they want them to inherit
[37:19.400 --> 37:26.520]  the world so that america will be no more and they can have the one world totalitarian
[37:26.520 --> 37:34.680]  authoritarian government that is the pipe dream of authoritarians and sycophants throughout
[37:34.680 --> 37:42.800]  world history but oh yeah that's the joke is how you only see white people on tv now
[37:42.800 --> 37:52.880]  actually the joke is how you only see black people on tv now and the truth is it's really
[37:52.880 --> 37:58.920]  not even something that is is really a big deal i don't think other than it's just what
[37:58.920 --> 38:04.080]  a cultural phenomenon we're witnessing but now all the corporations want corporate black
[38:04.080 --> 38:08.560]  face now that's what they do is they hire a black person to represent their brand because
[38:08.560 --> 38:13.680]  it's all about corporate blackface now but biden tells you all you see on tv is white
[38:13.680 --> 38:20.120]  people says the white president who's been in office for what 700 years now i mean biden
[38:20.120 --> 38:26.240]  might have witnessed the first transaction of slaves you know coming from africa here
[38:26.240 --> 38:30.280]  biden probably was a part of that he may have purchased a couple and and now listen to this
[38:30.280 --> 38:36.480]  biden claims that we have the best economy in the world listen to this here we are we
[38:36.480 --> 38:47.840]  have the fastest growing economy in the world the world the world sorry one more time joe
[38:47.840 --> 38:54.560]  this makes sense is why here we are we have the fastest growing economy in the world the
[38:54.560 --> 39:02.280]  world the world here we are we have the fastest growing economy in the world really the world
[39:02.280 --> 39:09.960]  we have the fastest growing economy in the world according to joe biden wow i'd fastest
[39:09.960 --> 39:15.920]  growing economy in the world where where what is he what planet does he live on what metrics
[39:15.920 --> 39:22.320]  what data what proof what evidence does he have of that americans are suffering actually
[39:22.320 --> 39:25.680]  i've got a whole stack of news on how americans are suffering in the economy is suffering
[39:25.680 --> 39:29.640]  but then joe biden just says best economy in the world best economic recovery in history
[39:29.640 --> 39:38.280]  jack what an unmitigated unfazed liar joe biden is and jimmy kimmel just sits right up there
[39:38.280 --> 39:43.880]  and takes it and then here's one more from joe biden on jimmy kimmel last night on clip
[39:43.880 --> 39:51.840]  28 this makes sense is why it doesn't make sense and why it seems so crazy and that we
[39:51.840 --> 39:57.160]  have so many problems and that maybe it's just that americans aren't as knowledgeable as they
[39:57.160 --> 40:03.360]  should be or maybe that's just democrats a death star pumping false information into
[40:03.360 --> 40:09.800]  our fox that's cnn or maybe or maybe it's always been this way i mean here in la what
[40:09.800 --> 40:14.960]  like like you know a small fraction of people voted in the primary yesterday and then everybody
[40:14.960 --> 40:19.760]  wants to complain about everything and it's just it's enough already and i think you
[40:19.760 --> 40:24.080]  see needs to start yelling at people is really what i think here's what i think look or maybe
[40:24.080 --> 40:29.920]  shooting them after all we're democrats impact the pandemic has had on people it has had
[40:29.920 --> 40:35.480]  enormous impact negative and fake pandemic think of just think of just your kids how
[40:35.480 --> 40:40.240]  how do we got to go to a prom i'm had a graduation because of you because of democrats how many
[40:40.240 --> 40:45.760]  of how much has changed in terms of the relationships between people and how they interact with one
[40:45.760 --> 40:52.360]  another so much has changed and we need vek murthy the surgeon general talks about the
[40:52.360 --> 40:58.960]  need for significant mental health proposals liberalism is a mental disorder i agree feeling
[40:58.960 --> 41:05.680]  not knowing where they're going not knowing how how to respond not knowing how to act
[41:05.680 --> 41:11.960]  just stunning stuff in it just incredible stuff there i just i don't even know how
[41:11.960 --> 41:19.360]  to respond you know it's just everything they say is a lie i mean jimmy did it feel good
[41:19.360 --> 41:23.680]  to sell your soul to the democrats how much are they paying you man is it worth it was
[41:23.680 --> 41:29.120]  your soul worth it to become the mouthpiece for these scumbag liars but see joe joe biden
[41:29.120 --> 41:37.360]  says oh look at how much we suffered in coveted the fake pandemic folks forget about that they
[41:37.360 --> 41:42.080]  want to end america forget about everything that was lost during coveted they're gonna
[41:42.080 --> 41:54.520]  end america the biden boom oh oh my gosh but you know joe biden and jimmy kimmel going
[41:54.520 --> 41:57.880]  on national tv telling you it's the greatest economy ever how do you think americans are
[41:57.880 --> 42:02.000]  gonna feel about that who can't even afford to fill their tank can't even afford to put
[42:02.000 --> 42:07.200]  food on the table how do you think they're gonna feel about that so it's it's not a good
[42:07.200 --> 42:11.680]  thing but keep lying democrats keep doing what you do and you're just gonna become more and
[42:11.680 --> 42:16.240]  more unpopular and you'll have to steal the midterms more than you even stole the presidential
[42:16.240 --> 42:24.520]  election so but look folks we know that there are serious food shortages coming or serious
[42:24.520 --> 42:32.920]  price increases coming with the inflation that's why we launched our new site where did it

[43:57.320 --> 44:00.000]  and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[44:00.000 --> 44:02.200]  Our world is so full of hype.
[44:03.080 --> 44:05.640]  We are force-fed dehumanizing propaganda
[44:05.640 --> 44:07.200]  by the corporate media,
[44:07.200 --> 44:09.920]  by the controlled churches and the universities.
[44:09.920 --> 44:11.480]  And why is this the case?
[44:11.480 --> 44:14.240]  Because we innately, by God,
[44:14.240 --> 44:16.040]  have been given the keys to our own minds,
[44:16.040 --> 44:18.120]  our own psyches, our own souls.
[44:18.120 --> 44:21.040]  And by connecting to God, we can empower ourselves
[44:21.040 --> 44:25.640]  and trend, sin, the quote, fallen or sinful state.
[44:25.640 --> 44:27.320]  So the chemicals that we ingest,
[44:27.320 --> 44:30.040]  and all the things that we try to bring into our bodies
[44:30.040 --> 44:32.640]  to change who we are,
[44:32.640 --> 44:33.600]  are only lowering us.
[44:33.600 --> 44:35.280]  They're only making us more depressed.
[44:35.280 --> 44:37.680]  In the end, they're only making us less filled.
[44:37.680 --> 44:39.800]  It is only by going within
[44:39.800 --> 44:41.040]  and really making that connection to God
[44:41.040 --> 44:43.320]  that we can truly empower ourselves.
[44:43.320 --> 44:46.520]  That's why the globe was bombarded with toxins and chemicals
[44:46.520 --> 44:49.320]  to block us getting the normal vitamins and minerals
[44:49.320 --> 44:52.000]  and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy
[44:52.000 --> 44:54.600]  and to be able to basically reach out
[44:54.600 --> 44:55.960]  beyond the third dimension.
[44:55.960 --> 44:57.680]  And that's where the incredible products come in
[44:57.680 --> 44:59.000]  at MFullerStore.com.
[45:00.000 --> 45:02.680]  The eugenicists over 100 years ago
[45:02.680 --> 45:04.160]  were very public about their plans.
[45:04.160 --> 45:05.600]  They financed major universities.
[45:05.600 --> 45:09.480]  They ran full-page stories and advertisements
[45:09.480 --> 45:11.480]  pushing their propaganda of New York Times,
[45:11.480 --> 45:13.080]  other major newspapers.
[45:13.080 --> 45:16.080]  That the family, as we know it, is a bad thing
[45:16.080 --> 45:17.400]  and must be ended.
[45:17.400 --> 45:19.520]  The first step in that is getting women
[45:19.520 --> 45:21.480]  out of the household and teaching.
[45:21.480 --> 45:24.640]  Women that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons
[45:24.640 --> 45:26.960]  and daughters and husbands is a bad thing.
[45:26.960 --> 45:29.480]  And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner
[45:29.480 --> 45:31.360]  for my daughter, my four-natural daughter.
[45:31.360 --> 45:33.080]  My wife makes dinner a lot of times,
[45:33.080 --> 45:34.040]  but I like to make it as well.
[45:34.040 --> 45:35.480]  I love to make breakfast.
[45:35.480 --> 45:37.720]  And literally, it's the funnest thing on earth
[45:37.720 --> 45:40.960]  to make food for your family and be nurturative
[45:40.960 --> 45:44.440]  and then all sit down together and have the communal event.
[45:44.440 --> 45:47.880]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding
[45:47.880 --> 45:50.800]  is our normal biological actions are coming together.
[45:50.800 --> 45:54.680]  They really are sick, evil, scientific cult of filth
[45:54.680 --> 45:57.440]  that want to domesticate us and turn us into lab rats.
[45:57.440 --> 45:59.600]  We cannot let this continue.
[45:59.600 --> 46:03.240]  I designed over 200 t-shirts the last 25 years.
[46:03.240 --> 46:05.120]  And we have some of those original designs
[46:05.120 --> 46:07.320]  still for sale at fullerstore.com.
[46:07.320 --> 46:08.840]  These are real classics.

[46:11.080 --> 46:14.240]  limited edition because we're selling out of them.
[46:14.240 --> 46:15.640]  They're about to be history.
[46:15.640 --> 46:18.400]  And we're selling out of the hoodies, the ball caps,
[46:18.400 --> 46:20.680]  the t-shirts, all these amazing designs
[46:20.680 --> 46:22.360]  at costinfullerstore.com.
[46:22.360 --> 46:24.360]  Except for this fundraiser shirt
[46:24.360 --> 46:25.800]  that is a real hit and people love it.
[46:25.800 --> 46:27.040]  It's $24.95.
[46:27.040 --> 46:28.480]  Alex Jones is right on the front.
[46:28.480 --> 46:29.640]  The Red Thunderbolt.

[46:36.840 --> 46:40.520]  silence you and fund the info war at the same time.
[46:40.520 --> 46:43.040]  There is not a more politically incorrect shirt
[46:43.040 --> 46:45.440]  that sends a stronger message of freedom, resistance
[46:45.440 --> 46:48.120]  to the new world order than the Alex Jones was right shirt,
[46:48.120 --> 46:50.920]  exclusively available at infowarsstore.com.
[46:50.920 --> 46:53.680]  And again, this shirt is limited edition as well.

[47:00.560 --> 47:05.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,

[47:17.600 --> 47:19.880]  The Democrats are collapsing America.

[47:30.240 --> 47:35.080]  And isn't it amazing how, with the Uvaldi shooting,
[47:35.080 --> 47:38.560]  it's the gun's fault, but in the Kenosha situation
[47:38.560 --> 47:40.040]  where Carl Rittenhouse defended his life
[47:40.040 --> 47:43.280]  against violent criminals, it was his fault.
[47:43.280 --> 47:44.720]  Isn't that amazing?
[47:44.720 --> 47:48.000]  Liberal logic, it's not logic, it's propaganda.
[47:48.000 --> 47:50.880]  How do you know because it can't be applied universally?
[47:50.880 --> 47:53.120]  It's the easiest test to find out whether it's logic
[47:53.120 --> 47:53.800]  or propaganda.
[47:53.800 --> 47:55.600]  Can it be applied universally?
[47:55.600 --> 47:57.360]  If not, it's propaganda.
[47:57.360 --> 47:59.560]  It's liberalism.
[47:59.560 --> 48:05.520]  Here are some of the laws that passed in the House last night.
[48:05.520 --> 48:07.160]  They've got an uphill battle in the Senate,
[48:07.160 --> 48:09.240]  but if they get even one of these passed,
[48:09.240 --> 48:12.480]  it'll be bad for America.
[48:12.480 --> 48:17.480]  US House of Representatives votes to criminalize disassembling,
[48:17.480 --> 48:19.640]  cleaning, and reassembling your gun
[48:19.640 --> 48:22.880]  without a firearm manufacturer's license.
[48:22.880 --> 48:24.840]  What?
[48:24.840 --> 48:25.880]  What?
[48:25.880 --> 48:27.480]  That is insanity.
[48:27.480 --> 48:28.760]  You can't clean your gun.
[48:28.760 --> 48:30.880]  You can't take apart and reassemble your gun
[48:30.880 --> 48:32.320]  unless you have a license.
[48:32.320 --> 48:35.320]  What?
[48:35.320 --> 48:36.480]  That doesn't even make any sense.
[48:36.480 --> 48:41.280]  Not to mention it's dangerous not to clean your firearm.
[48:41.280 --> 48:43.240]  Passed in the House.
[48:43.240 --> 48:44.760]  Makes no sense at all.
[48:44.760 --> 48:48.600]  They also passed bills that said you
[48:48.600 --> 48:53.800]  have to have some sort of a storage for your firearm.
[48:53.800 --> 48:56.960]  Your magazine cannot be in your firearm.
[48:56.960 --> 49:01.840]  So remember, they passed laws like, for example, how
[49:01.840 --> 49:04.240]  if you're in your vehicle, some states
[49:04.240 --> 49:07.400]  you cannot have a loaded gun and you cannot even
[49:07.400 --> 49:08.800]  have the gun next to the ammo.
[49:08.800 --> 49:11.040]  It has to be completely separately stored.
[49:11.040 --> 49:11.600]  Oh, OK.
[49:11.600 --> 49:16.160]  So criminal comes to rob your car, rob you at gunpoint.
[49:16.160 --> 49:18.600]  You're going to say, excuse me, sir,
[49:18.600 --> 49:21.600]  I have a gun legally stashed in my glove compartment
[49:21.600 --> 49:23.680]  locked away, as the law says.
[49:23.680 --> 49:27.040]  And my magazine with my ammo is in the back of my trunk.
[49:27.040 --> 49:28.680]  Would you mind just holding right there
[49:28.680 --> 49:31.320]  while I unlock my glove compartment
[49:31.320 --> 49:33.920]  and then go into my trunk and load my weapon
[49:33.920 --> 49:35.920]  so that I can defend myself against you right now?
[49:35.920 --> 49:37.240]  Would you mind that?
[49:37.240 --> 49:38.160]  That's insanity.
[49:38.160 --> 49:39.400]  But that's the law.
[49:39.400 --> 49:41.320]  That's what we're doing right now.
[49:41.320 --> 49:44.440]  Now they're doing the same thing in your house.
[49:44.440 --> 49:46.120]  Or at least that's what they want to do.
[49:46.120 --> 49:48.080]  Oh, criminal comes into your house with a gun
[49:48.080 --> 49:50.720]  to murder you or rape your wife or steal your stuff,
[49:50.720 --> 49:52.840]  torture your kids.
[49:52.840 --> 49:55.120]  He's got a gun and you say, oh, sir, sir,
[49:55.120 --> 49:56.480]  I noticed you have a gun and you're
[49:56.480 --> 49:59.320]  about to rape my wife and kill my kids.
[49:59.320 --> 50:03.680]  I have my legally stashed gun in a safe over there.
[50:03.680 --> 50:06.840]  Do you mind if I go get my gun out of it safe?
[50:06.840 --> 50:11.120]  And I'm not allowed to keep my magazine in the gun anymore,
[50:11.120 --> 50:12.320]  either, or keep the gun loaded.
[50:12.320 --> 50:15.880]  So I'm going to have to go to my other storage case to load it.
[50:15.880 --> 50:17.920]  Do you mind waiting here for five to 10 minutes
[50:17.920 --> 50:21.920]  while I get my firearm ready to defend me against you
[50:21.920 --> 50:24.600]  and defend my family against you?
[50:24.600 --> 50:27.240]  That's how it'll work, right?
[50:27.240 --> 50:28.920]  Oh, yes, this is what you're seeing on screen.
[50:28.920 --> 50:29.960]  That's illegal now.
[50:29.960 --> 50:31.280]  Oh, no, no, no.
[50:31.280 --> 50:32.920]  Don't think about cleaning your weapon.
[50:32.920 --> 50:34.720]  That's illegal now.
[50:34.720 --> 50:35.480]  It's insanity.
[50:35.480 --> 50:36.520]  It doesn't stop anything.
[50:36.520 --> 50:37.960]  It's not going to stop a school shooting.
[50:37.960 --> 50:39.360]  It's not going to stop a mass shooting.
[50:39.360 --> 50:41.240]  It's not going to stop a crime.
[50:41.240 --> 50:42.120]  It's all pandering.
[50:42.120 --> 50:44.560]  It's all lunacy.
[50:44.560 --> 50:48.840]  It's all Democrats taking advantage of a tragedy,
[50:48.840 --> 50:52.080]  nitpicking away at our Second Amendment rights.
[50:52.080 --> 50:53.840]  You want to stop school shootings?
[50:53.840 --> 50:55.160]  The answer is simple.
[50:55.160 --> 50:57.720]  Put well-trained armed guards at schools.
[50:57.720 --> 50:59.400]  We may not like that solution, but it's
[50:59.400 --> 51:00.920]  the only one that's going to work.
[51:00.920 --> 51:03.960]  Stopping people from having access to a firearm readily
[51:03.960 --> 51:06.760]  available in their house to defend themselves and their family
[51:06.760 --> 51:12.200]  has no impact on school shootings whatsoever.
[51:12.200 --> 51:17.040]  Oh, but see, we're doing something.
[51:17.040 --> 51:19.000]  We're doing something.
[51:19.000 --> 51:21.920]  They're also trying to ban any magazines that
[51:21.920 --> 51:24.200]  hold more than 15 rounds of ammunition.
[51:24.200 --> 51:25.800]  So that's like half of the firearms
[51:25.800 --> 51:32.200]  are now going to be illegal, all in response to a mass shooting
[51:32.200 --> 51:34.200]  that they say they just want to prevent another one,
[51:34.200 --> 51:37.880]  but yet they're not doing anything to prevent another one.
[51:37.880 --> 51:40.760]  Incredible, isn't it?
[51:40.760 --> 51:42.920]  Thomas Massey, one of the good ones,
[51:42.920 --> 51:44.760]  they said the quiet part out loud.
[51:44.760 --> 51:47.040]  They don't just want to ban assault weapons.
[51:47.040 --> 51:50.080]  They want to ban all semi-automatic rifles.
[51:50.080 --> 51:53.120]  This is the official House Democrats Twitter.
[51:53.120 --> 51:55.440]  It says semi-automatic rifles are weapons of war.
[51:55.440 --> 51:57.520]  Refusing to act and save lives in this moment
[51:57.520 --> 52:00.000]  is an immoral abandonment of our constitutional duty.
[52:00.000 --> 52:02.400]  Oh, my gosh.
[52:02.400 --> 52:03.440]  Oh, my gosh.
[52:03.440 --> 52:05.440]  Democrats talking about morals.
[52:05.440 --> 52:08.920]  You kill millions of babies.
[52:08.920 --> 52:11.360]  Democrats talking about morals.
[52:11.360 --> 52:12.840]  Spare me.
[52:12.840 --> 52:14.080]  Spare me, please.
[52:14.080 --> 52:16.400]  And I got news for you.
[52:16.400 --> 52:20.160]  Yes, weapons of war actually is what
[52:20.160 --> 52:21.800]  the Second Amendment is about.
[52:21.800 --> 52:23.600]  Sorry, I know you don't like to hear that,
[52:23.600 --> 52:25.560]  and you lie about it, but no, it is.
[52:25.560 --> 52:28.280]  So yes, Democrats, they just want to take it all.
[52:28.280 --> 52:30.240]  And they are trying to raise the age
[52:30.240 --> 52:34.600]  to purchase a firearm to 21, to 21.
[52:34.600 --> 52:35.720]  So you can vote when you're 18.
[52:35.720 --> 52:38.720]  You can go serve and die for your country when you're 18,
[52:38.720 --> 52:41.360]  but you can't have a Second Amendment, right?
[52:41.360 --> 52:43.520]  And Democrats say it's their constitutional duty
[52:43.520 --> 52:45.640]  to remove the Second Amendment.
[52:45.640 --> 52:47.160]  Amazing.
[52:47.160 --> 52:48.080]  Amazing.
[52:48.080 --> 52:50.520]  The Democrat lunacy doesn't stop.
[52:50.520 --> 52:52.200]  This is from the Chicago Sun Times.
[52:52.200 --> 52:54.120]  You've never seen something more ridiculous.
[52:54.120 --> 52:58.560]  Restrict guns for the same reason as child porn.
[52:58.560 --> 53:00.560]  What?
[53:00.560 --> 53:01.800]  What?
[53:01.800 --> 53:03.200]  Folks, that's a real story.
[53:03.200 --> 53:06.040]  Neil Steinberg, Chicago Sun Times.
[53:06.040 --> 53:11.560]  Restrict guns for the same reason as child porn.
[53:11.560 --> 53:14.040]  If you're comparing the Second Amendment and guns
[53:14.040 --> 53:16.720]  to child porn, you might be a pedophile.
[53:16.720 --> 53:18.040]  You might be a pervert.
[53:18.040 --> 53:20.080]  If you went and looked at his internet history,
[53:20.080 --> 53:21.320]  if you went and looked at his hard drive,
[53:21.320 --> 53:23.320]  you think you'd find anything?
[53:23.320 --> 53:24.640]  Hmm.
[53:24.640 --> 53:26.680]  Restrict guns for the same reason as child porn.
[53:26.680 --> 53:28.160]  Are you?
[53:28.160 --> 53:30.080]  You've lost your mind.
[53:30.080 --> 53:32.080]  Only a liberal.
[53:32.080 --> 53:33.360]  Only a liberal.
[53:33.360 --> 53:35.160]  But what about porn?
[53:35.160 --> 53:36.360]  What about child porn?
[53:36.360 --> 53:38.320]  Twitter refused to remove child porn,
[53:38.320 --> 53:40.880]  because they say it didn't violate their policies.
[53:40.880 --> 53:42.280]  According to a lawsuit.
[53:42.280 --> 53:44.520]  Wow.
[53:44.520 --> 53:47.480]  Twitter refused to take down widely-shared pornographic
[53:47.480 --> 53:49.960]  images and videos of teenage sex trafficking victims
[53:49.960 --> 53:53.520]  because an investigation didn't find a violation of Twitter's
[53:53.520 --> 53:55.520]  policies.
[53:55.520 --> 53:56.400]  That's nice.
[53:56.400 --> 53:57.800]  Isn't that sweet?
[53:57.800 --> 53:59.160]  Trump's not allowed on Twitter.
[53:59.160 --> 54:00.080]  I'm not allowed on Twitter.
[54:00.080 --> 54:01.360]  The truth isn't allowed on Twitter.
[54:01.360 --> 54:03.280]  But child porn?
[54:03.280 --> 54:03.960]  Good.
[54:03.960 --> 54:06.600]  Good for Twitter.
[54:06.600 --> 54:09.560]  Must be a Democrat party platform.
[54:09.560 --> 54:13.280]  Who do you think lobbied Twitter to keep child porn up there?
[54:13.280 --> 54:14.040]  I don't know.
[54:14.040 --> 54:15.480]  Maybe somebody should ask Joe Biden that.
[54:15.480 --> 54:18.120]  How does gun control work exactly in Nigeria, though?
[54:18.120 --> 54:20.720]  Very strict gun control laws.
[54:20.720 --> 54:23.840]  Over 50 parishioners, including children,
[54:23.840 --> 54:28.920]  killed in violent satanic mass shooting
[54:28.920 --> 54:31.520]  inside Catholic Church in Nigeria.
[54:31.520 --> 54:34.120]  At least 50 dead, including many children.
[54:34.120 --> 54:37.320]  St. Francis Catholic Church in Nigeria.
[54:37.320 --> 54:39.280]  Very strict gun laws.
[54:39.280 --> 54:42.400]  Some of the strictest you can have.
[54:42.400 --> 54:44.280]  And it did not stop this mass murder.
[54:44.280 --> 54:47.000]  Oh, but Democrats say it doesn't happen anywhere else.
[54:47.000 --> 54:48.400]  Oh, it never happens anywhere else.
[54:48.400 --> 54:50.600]  Oh, really?
[54:50.600 --> 54:54.160]  I believe there's seven or eight countries that have more gun
[54:54.160 --> 54:55.160]  crimes than America.
[54:55.160 --> 54:57.280]  So they just lie about that.
[54:57.280 --> 55:01.160]  House Democrats propose 1,000% tax increase on, quote,
[55:01.160 --> 55:02.240]  unquote, assault weapons.
[55:02.240 --> 55:04.720]  Again, there is no what is an assault weapon.
[55:04.720 --> 55:07.400]  I mean, brass knuckles could be an assault weapon.
[55:07.400 --> 55:08.280]  No, it's just guns.
[55:08.280 --> 55:09.720]  They want 1,000% increase on guns.
[55:09.720 --> 55:11.360]  Well, that works for them.
[55:11.360 --> 55:14.320]  That way, all of them and with all of their money
[55:14.320 --> 55:16.880]  can still have access to firearms, but you can't.
[55:16.880 --> 55:19.000]  You see, that's what it's all about.
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.400]  Matthew McConaughey wants to take your guns,
[55:21.400 --> 55:23.480]  but he has armed security.
[55:23.480 --> 55:25.280]  Nancy Pelosi wants to take your guns,
[55:25.280 --> 55:26.800]  but she has armed security.
[55:26.800 --> 55:28.280]  Joe Biden wants to take your guns,
[55:28.280 --> 55:30.120]  but he has armed security.
[55:30.120 --> 55:33.280]  How is it they never have to answer these questions?
[55:33.280 --> 55:36.960]  How is it they never have to or are never
[55:36.960 --> 55:39.480]  challenged on this hypocrisy, never challenged
[55:39.480 --> 55:41.280]  on this double standard?
[55:41.280 --> 55:45.840]  Like, hey, you keep talking about how guns are the problem,
[55:45.840 --> 55:49.360]  but I notice you're followed around by armed security.
[55:49.360 --> 55:51.800]  Why is that?
[55:51.800 --> 55:53.600]  Well, of course, you know what they would say.
[55:53.600 --> 55:56.440]  Remember, Lori Lightfoot, well, I'm more important than you.
[55:56.440 --> 55:59.400]  I get to go out and get my hair done
[55:59.400 --> 56:01.840]  during a pandemic when I shut everyone else's business down
[56:01.840 --> 56:04.240]  because I'm more important than you.
[56:04.240 --> 56:07.200]  I can't wait till this actually comes up because it's going to.
[56:07.200 --> 56:08.800]  It's inevitable.
[56:08.800 --> 56:11.560]  All these Democrats calling for gun control,
[56:11.560 --> 56:14.280]  someone's going to finally ask them, it's going to happen.
[56:14.280 --> 56:17.480]  Hey, you keep calling for gun control followed
[56:17.480 --> 56:20.080]  around by armed security.
[56:20.080 --> 56:22.760]  Are you going to have your armed security turn its guns
[56:22.760 --> 56:23.960]  into, well, of course not.
[56:23.960 --> 56:25.360]  I'm more important than you.
[56:25.360 --> 56:27.880]  Cannot wait for that to come out of a Democrat's mouth,
[56:27.880 --> 56:30.240]  and you know it's going to happen.
[56:30.240 --> 56:31.480]  You know it's inevitable, and you know
[56:31.480 --> 56:33.400]  that that's their response.
[56:33.400 --> 56:37.160]  And I can't wait till that day comes because then you
[56:37.160 --> 56:38.920]  can look at the Democrat voter in the liberal
[56:38.920 --> 56:44.240]  and say, OK, do you believe that politicians are above you?
[56:44.240 --> 56:46.360]  And then they'll probably say yes.
[56:46.360 --> 56:49.160]  And then they will probably go ahead and just say yes
[56:49.160 --> 56:52.120]  and admit that they're slaves at that point.
[56:52.120 --> 56:55.640]  Pregnant woman used AR-15 to drop armed robber
[56:55.640 --> 56:58.920]  attacking her 11-year-old daughter.
[56:58.920 --> 57:00.440]  Well, but you don't need an AR-15.
[57:00.440 --> 57:02.040]  You don't need a gun.
[57:02.040 --> 57:05.960]  And it's too bad that Democrats didn't have their laws in place
[57:05.960 --> 57:12.040]  because if Mrs. King had her rifle stored in a safe
[57:12.040 --> 57:15.080]  and separated from her magazine, it probably
[57:15.080 --> 57:17.760]  would have taken about five minutes for her to assemble
[57:17.760 --> 57:19.520]  all that to defend her daughter.
[57:19.520 --> 57:22.640]  But luckily, those insane laws were not in place in Florida,
[57:22.640 --> 57:27.040]  and she was able to save her daughter's life and her own life.
[57:27.040 --> 57:29.240]  But probably would have had an 11-year-old
[57:29.240 --> 57:32.680]  dead or raped if Democrat laws went into place.
[57:32.680 --> 57:35.520]  Naperville Cop fatally shoots hatchet-wielding man
[57:35.520 --> 57:37.720]  during traffic stop.
[57:37.720 --> 57:40.440]  Guy comes at him with a hatchet, tries to kill him,
[57:40.440 --> 57:44.760]  pulls his gun, and stops that wild man from killing him.
[57:44.760 --> 57:45.720]  But hey, you know what?
[57:45.720 --> 57:47.760]  We should probably just get rid of all the guns.
[57:50.400 --> 57:52.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, high-quality,
[57:52.120 --> 57:56.480]  storeable food is back in stock, ready to ship right now.
[57:56.480 --> 57:58.440]  We've not been selling food for three months
[57:58.440 --> 58:00.680]  because it was taking several weeks for the food
[58:00.680 --> 58:02.360]  to get packaged and delivered to you.
[58:02.360 --> 58:04.520]  Most of their companies are completely out,
[58:04.520 --> 58:07.920]  but now they have a large spectrum of high-quality food
[58:07.920 --> 58:08.680]  ready to ship.
[58:08.680 --> 58:11.360]  Everything you find at PrepareWithAlex.com
[58:11.360 --> 58:14.560]  or PrepareToDay.com is in stock, ready to ship.
[58:14.560 --> 58:17.960]  So go to PrepareWithAlex.com or PrepareToDay.com

[58:20.160 --> 58:21.880]  ready to ship to you and your family.
[58:21.880 --> 58:24.280]  With the inflation happening, with the food shortages,
[58:24.280 --> 58:26.040]  with the wars, with the collapsing wars,
[58:26.040 --> 58:28.120]  everything's happening is one of the most important
[58:28.120 --> 58:30.040]  things you can make is to have high-quality,
[58:30.040 --> 58:32.840]  storeable food, water filtration, air filtration, and more.
[58:32.840 --> 58:35.040]  And it's not just those items, it's hundreds of other
[58:35.040 --> 58:37.440]  high-quality, preparedness items and survival items
[58:37.440 --> 58:39.880]  right now at PrepareWithAlex.com,
[58:39.880 --> 58:43.680]  that again redirects to PrepareToday.com.
[58:43.680 --> 58:45.440]  I would not procrastinate, ladies and gentlemen,
[58:45.440 --> 58:46.720]  one of the most important things you can do
[58:46.720 --> 58:48.280]  is get ahead of inflation now
[58:48.280 --> 58:50.080]  because the inflation is just beginning.
[58:50.080 --> 58:51.840]  I want to thank all of you over the years
[58:51.840 --> 58:53.680]  who have supported InfoWars financially
[58:53.680 --> 58:55.640]  with word of mouth and prayer.
[58:55.640 --> 58:57.400]  All the success that we've had together
[58:57.400 --> 58:59.160]  against the globalists and the fact that we're not
[58:59.160 --> 59:02.040]  caught flat-footed during their major takeover
[59:02.040 --> 59:03.200]  is because of you.
[59:03.200 --> 59:06.240]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[59:06.240 --> 59:08.200]  I just want to thank you all for buying products
[59:08.200 --> 59:10.760]  at InfoWars.com, like books and films and supplements
[59:10.760 --> 59:13.320]  and water filtration, air filtration, so much more.
[59:13.320 --> 59:14.800]  But for those of you that want to actually give us
[59:14.800 --> 59:17.760]  a straight donation so we get almost 100% of the money

[59:24.200 --> 59:26.520]  you'll see a link to make a straight donation.
[59:26.520 --> 59:29.880]  A one-time donation of $5, $10, $50,
[59:29.880 --> 59:32.560]  or a recurring donation you can cancel anytime.
[59:32.560 --> 59:34.120]  I want to thank all of you that have donated.
[59:34.120 --> 59:35.880]  I want to encourage those of you out there
[59:35.880 --> 59:38.120]  that want to support Freedom to take action now
[59:38.120 --> 59:40.320]  and be part of the global awakening,
[59:40.320 --> 59:42.960]  the new renaissance that's counter the great reset
[59:42.960 --> 59:45.000]  by going to InfoWarsStore.com
[59:45.000 --> 59:47.320]  and clicking on the donate button and giving today.
[59:47.320 --> 59:48.720]  Thank you so much for your support.
[59:48.720 --> 59:49.560]  Please take action.
[59:51.080 --> 59:53.880]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[59:53.880 --> 59:55.600]  of the New World Order,
[59:55.600 --> 59:57.440]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:00.440 --> 1:00:05.440]  ["To the Town of Our Breeders Strange One Fine Day"]
[1:00:07.520 --> 1:00:09.920]  Now we need to make sure
[1:00:09.920 --> 1:00:12.960]  we really fully support the good members of Congress
[1:00:12.960 --> 1:00:16.160]  that we have, which is sadly very few,
[1:00:16.160 --> 1:00:18.320]  but we really need to get behind them and pray for them
[1:00:18.320 --> 1:00:21.960]  and reassure them that we love them
[1:00:21.960 --> 1:00:24.120]  and we're praying for them and we support their work,
[1:00:24.120 --> 1:00:25.640]  never give up.
[1:00:25.640 --> 1:00:27.720]  Marjorie Taylor Greene is one of them
[1:00:27.720 --> 1:00:31.080]  and here she is calling out Lindsey Graham
[1:00:31.080 --> 1:00:36.080]  on his Democrats, Democrat leanings
[1:00:36.560 --> 1:00:39.000]  on gun control in clip seven.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:41.120]  So here's what I've been asking everyone to do.
[1:00:41.120 --> 1:00:45.000]  I'm asking everyone to call Senator Lindsey Graham's office,
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  202-224-5972, call Senator Graham
[1:00:50.560 --> 1:00:53.360]  and tell him to stop helping Joe Biden
[1:00:53.360 --> 1:00:56.160]  destroy your freedoms, take away your gun rights
[1:00:56.160 --> 1:00:57.560]  and burn this country down.
[1:00:57.560 --> 1:00:59.960]  Tell Senator Lindsey Graham to be a Republican
[1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:01.680]  and to do his job in the Senate.
[1:01:01.680 --> 1:01:04.040]  That is hold the line and vote no
[1:01:04.040 --> 1:01:08.120]  to Joe Biden's red flag gun confiscation bills.
[1:01:08.120 --> 1:01:10.520]  Guys, you heard it from the Congresswoman right there.
[1:01:10.520 --> 1:01:11.640]  She is fired up.
[1:01:11.640 --> 1:01:14.480]  I can tell you that she treats every single day
[1:01:14.480 --> 1:01:17.160]  when it comes to the Second Amendment like our last.
[1:01:17.160 --> 1:01:19.280]  She's fighting, she's pushing in the house.
[1:01:19.280 --> 1:01:20.600]  She has some great colleagues as well
[1:01:20.600 --> 1:01:21.840]  who are pushing as well,
[1:01:21.840 --> 1:01:23.440]  but that fight is over in the Senate.
[1:01:23.440 --> 1:01:25.320]  Make the call to Lindsey Graham's office,
[1:01:25.320 --> 1:01:27.060]  make the call to your Senator's offices,
[1:01:27.060 --> 1:01:30.120]  go to stopredflags.com, keep the heat on.
[1:01:30.120 --> 1:01:32.000]  Yes, there's big fights in the house this week,
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:36.280]  but also the big showdown battle is over in the Senate.
[1:01:36.280 --> 1:01:37.680]  Congresswoman, I know you got a busy day,
[1:01:37.680 --> 1:01:41.000]  you're running all over town, fighting for our rights really
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:43.760]  and we appreciate you coming on and just keep up the fight.
[1:01:43.760 --> 1:01:44.600]  Marjorie.
[1:01:44.600 --> 1:01:45.560]  Thank you for being here, Patrick.
[1:01:45.560 --> 1:01:46.960]  Marjorie Taylor Greene.
[1:01:46.960 --> 1:01:48.960]  Thank you for doing the work that you're doing.
[1:01:50.960 --> 1:01:53.320]  To be activists and show them how to get out there
[1:01:53.320 --> 1:01:56.760]  and really talk to their representatives, their Senators
[1:01:56.760 --> 1:01:58.840]  and do the lobbying work themselves,
[1:01:58.840 --> 1:02:00.200]  I think they would enjoy it.
[1:02:00.200 --> 1:02:02.360]  All right, guys, you heard her, take action,
[1:02:02.360 --> 1:02:04.640]  keep the pressure on and let's win this fight.
[1:02:04.640 --> 1:02:05.480]  Thanks.
[1:02:05.480 --> 1:02:06.320]  Thank you.
[1:02:06.320 --> 1:02:07.880]  Marjorie Taylor Greene, what a just,
[1:02:07.880 --> 1:02:09.720]  an absolute champion for freedom.
[1:02:09.720 --> 1:02:12.200]  God bless Marjorie Taylor Greene.
[1:02:12.200 --> 1:02:17.200]  Oh, thank you God, thank you God for Marjorie Taylor Greene
[1:02:17.400 --> 1:02:19.800]  and thank you God for Chip Roy as well.
[1:02:19.800 --> 1:02:23.240]  Here's Chip Roy calling out Joe Biden in clip five.
[1:02:23.240 --> 1:02:24.520]  I thank the speaker.
[1:02:24.520 --> 1:02:27.320]  Notice my colleague from Texas down here a little bit earlier
[1:02:27.320 --> 1:02:29.120]  talking about the tragedy in Uvalde
[1:02:29.120 --> 1:02:31.880]  and I can tell you, someone who represents Central Texas
[1:02:31.880 --> 1:02:34.400]  in a district in a county that shares a border
[1:02:34.400 --> 1:02:36.960]  with Uvalde County, it hits close to home.
[1:02:36.960 --> 1:02:39.080]  But I would note that the President of the United States
[1:02:39.080 --> 1:02:41.320]  and my colleagues have suddenly found Uvalde
[1:02:41.320 --> 1:02:42.920]  in South Texas on a map.
[1:02:42.920 --> 1:02:45.720]  When we've got 15,000 people in a caravan coming to Texas,
[1:02:45.720 --> 1:02:47.400]  we have seven hundred and some people,
[1:02:47.400 --> 1:02:48.840]  migrants who have died along the border,
[1:02:48.840 --> 1:02:52.520]  we have body morgues, mobile morgues being used
[1:02:52.520 --> 1:02:54.480]  in South Texas along the Rio Grande.
[1:02:54.480 --> 1:02:57.080]  And now suddenly to go exploit a tragedy
[1:02:57.080 --> 1:02:59.160]  for political purposes, my colleagues on the other side
[1:02:59.160 --> 1:03:01.400]  of the aisle can find Uvalde on a map.
[1:03:01.400 --> 1:03:02.480]  Because they sure as hell haven't been able
[1:03:02.480 --> 1:03:05.120]  to find Uvalde on a map over the last year and a half
[1:03:05.120 --> 1:03:06.600]  of this administration.
[1:03:06.600 --> 1:03:09.320]  We'll have more to talk this week about the politicization
[1:03:09.320 --> 1:03:12.520]  of this tragedy in Uvalde and targeting the pretext
[1:03:12.520 --> 1:03:14.440]  and the false use by my colleague from Texas
[1:03:14.440 --> 1:03:15.960]  of quote, automatic weapons,
[1:03:15.960 --> 1:03:17.760]  as opposed to semi-automatic weapons.
[1:03:17.760 --> 1:03:19.800]  But let's be clear, our borders remain wide open
[1:03:19.800 --> 1:03:21.840]  and Americans are dying in droves,
[1:03:21.840 --> 1:03:24.720]  hundreds and thousands of people across this country
[1:03:24.720 --> 1:03:26.360]  who are dying because of open borders.
[1:03:26.360 --> 1:03:29.280]  We'll talk about it this week, I yield back.
[1:03:29.280 --> 1:03:31.680]  You know, I've had the opportunity,
[1:03:31.680 --> 1:03:33.800]  I don't know if I'd quite call it a privilege
[1:03:33.800 --> 1:03:36.920]  to meet our politicians, but I've had the opportunity
[1:03:36.920 --> 1:03:39.280]  to meet a lot of our politicians.
[1:03:39.280 --> 1:03:43.280]  And I can tell you, Lauren Boebert is a real person.
[1:03:43.280 --> 1:03:44.840]  Chip Roy is a real person.
[1:03:44.840 --> 1:03:46.720]  Marjorie Taylor Greene is a real person.
[1:03:46.720 --> 1:03:48.160]  These are real people.
[1:03:49.400 --> 1:03:52.160]  And when I meet Democrats like Al Green,
[1:03:53.280 --> 1:03:55.480]  I mean, they're just the fakest people on earth folks.
[1:03:55.480 --> 1:03:56.680]  They're total frauds.
[1:03:57.960 --> 1:03:59.520]  They're just total frauds.
[1:03:59.520 --> 1:04:00.440]  And they know they're frauds.
[1:04:00.440 --> 1:04:03.760]  You can't be a Democrat without being a fraud and a liar.
[1:04:03.760 --> 1:04:05.320]  You can't hold these double standards.
[1:04:05.320 --> 1:04:07.000]  You can't have these policies
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:09.640]  unless you're just a total fraud and a liar.
[1:04:09.640 --> 1:04:13.400]  You cannot be a Democrat unless you are a lying fraud.
[1:04:17.120 --> 1:04:20.480]  We need to encourage more to be like Marjorie Taylor Greene
[1:04:20.480 --> 1:04:22.440]  and Thomas Massey and Chip Roy
[1:04:22.440 --> 1:04:24.880]  and Lauren Boebert and Matt Gates.
[1:04:26.040 --> 1:04:29.440]  We've probably got maybe 25,
[1:04:29.440 --> 1:04:34.440]  maybe 25 real patriots, real good, honest people.
[1:04:37.680 --> 1:04:39.680]  They're actually upholding their oath to the Constitution.
[1:04:39.680 --> 1:04:42.040]  We might have about 25 of them in Congress.
[1:04:42.040 --> 1:04:44.640]  And we need to be praying for them every night.
[1:04:44.640 --> 1:04:46.760]  And we need to be praying
[1:04:46.760 --> 1:04:49.040]  that reinforcements come for them every night.
[1:04:49.040 --> 1:04:50.480]  And we need to make sure
[1:04:50.480 --> 1:04:53.200]  that we prop up the right people heading into this midterm
[1:04:53.200 --> 1:04:59.840]  that we do get reinforcement for those great patriots.
[1:04:59.840 --> 1:05:03.080]  A lot of listeners have told us it's hard to find
[1:05:03.080 --> 1:05:04.760]  out of the thousands of great items
[1:05:04.760 --> 1:05:07.200]  at m4store.com, all the storeable food.
[1:05:07.200 --> 1:05:09.360]  So we've made it easy with our great partners
[1:05:09.360 --> 1:05:11.600]  that supply us with the highest quality storeable food
[1:05:11.600 --> 1:05:14.400]  out there at the lowest price you're gonna find for good food.
[1:05:14.400 --> 1:05:17.200]  Prepare to day.com.
[1:05:17.200 --> 1:05:20.800]  Go to preparetoday.com and protect yourself and your family
[1:05:20.800 --> 1:05:23.120]  with what's coming and what is already unfolding
[1:05:23.120 --> 1:05:24.400]  at the level of food shortages.
[1:05:24.400 --> 1:05:26.240]  I told you over two years ago,
[1:05:26.240 --> 1:05:28.320]  the global spread to have massive inflation
[1:05:28.320 --> 1:05:31.680]  and food shortages and it's happened just like clockwork.
[1:05:31.680 --> 1:05:34.160]  And I'm telling you, it's gonna get a lot worse.
[1:05:34.160 --> 1:05:35.480]  They have designed this.
[1:05:35.480 --> 1:05:37.880]  The way to beat them is to buy food now
[1:05:37.880 --> 1:05:40.960]  before your dollar is even more devalued.
[1:05:40.960 --> 1:05:43.080]  We're ready to ship to you right now
[1:05:43.080 --> 1:05:46.360]  at preparetoday.com and not just storeable food.
[1:05:46.360 --> 1:05:47.880]  Hundreds of the highest quality,
[1:05:47.880 --> 1:05:50.640]  survival and preparedness items in stock
[1:05:50.640 --> 1:05:52.880]  at low prices ready to ship to you right now
[1:05:52.880 --> 1:05:54.920]  at preparetoday.com.
[1:05:54.920 --> 1:05:57.720]  You can also use the URL preparewithalex.com
[1:05:57.720 --> 1:05:59.640]  that takes you there, take action.
[1:05:59.640 --> 1:06:04.640]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center
[1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:07.240]  and the heart of the resistance.
[1:06:07.240 --> 1:06:10.760]  And now your host, Owen Troyer.
[1:06:10.760 --> 1:06:13.640]  And don't forget now, but how could you forget?
[1:06:13.640 --> 1:06:16.240]  I forgot to tell you that Clay Clark
[1:06:16.240 --> 1:06:18.640]  is coming up in 30 minutes
[1:06:18.640 --> 1:06:21.200]  and then he's gonna be hosting the third hour
[1:06:21.200 --> 1:06:22.560]  of the Alex Jones show today.
[1:06:22.560 --> 1:06:23.840]  He's got great guests coming up.
[1:06:23.840 --> 1:06:26.280]  Paul Joseph Watson hosting the fourth hour.
[1:06:26.280 --> 1:06:28.920]  And then I'll be back hosting the War Room
[1:06:28.920 --> 1:06:31.040]  later this afternoon as well.
[1:06:31.040 --> 1:06:33.960]  But ladies and gentlemen, let me just explain something here.
[1:06:38.880 --> 1:06:41.320]  You know, Alex Jones being out
[1:06:41.320 --> 1:06:45.420]  is kind of like the Bulls without Michael Jordan.
[1:06:46.640 --> 1:06:51.120]  Interest is down, ticket sales are down, victories are down.
[1:06:51.120 --> 1:06:56.120]  And so when Alex takes a vacation and I fill in,
[1:06:56.400 --> 1:06:59.460]  a lot of people tune out when they see me hosting,
[1:06:59.460 --> 1:07:02.920]  hear me hosting, and a lot of people don't go to the website,
[1:07:02.920 --> 1:07:07.120]  a lot of people don't go and shop at infowarstore.com.
[1:07:07.120 --> 1:07:09.520]  So call it the Michael Jordan Bulls phenomenon.
[1:07:09.520 --> 1:07:11.320]  When Jordan isn't on the Bulls,
[1:07:11.320 --> 1:07:13.760]  people lose interest drastically.
[1:07:13.760 --> 1:07:16.280]  Sales and everything goes down.
[1:07:16.280 --> 1:07:21.280]  So folks, I'm asking you to pick up the losses here for me.

[1:07:48.200 --> 1:07:50.240]  Info Wars gold bar card.
[1:07:51.160 --> 1:07:53.680]  That's all at infowarstore.com.
[1:07:53.680 --> 1:07:57.960]  But folks, give Alex a little bit of,
[1:07:59.200 --> 1:08:00.480]  he's done pretty well so far.
[1:08:00.480 --> 1:08:03.480]  He's really, I think, enjoyed his time off.
[1:08:03.480 --> 1:08:07.160]  And we're not hearing as much from him as we normally are.
[1:08:07.160 --> 1:08:08.080]  So hey, that's good.
[1:08:08.080 --> 1:08:09.680]  I hope Alex is enjoying his time off.
[1:08:09.680 --> 1:08:11.520]  But folks, do me a favor.
[1:08:11.520 --> 1:08:13.520]  Go to infowarstore.com.
[1:08:13.520 --> 1:08:16.000]  If you don't like supplements, I know you use toothpaste.

[1:08:20.920 --> 1:08:23.200]  I love the coral toothpaste that we have.
[1:08:23.200 --> 1:08:25.160]  It is my favorite toothpaste.
[1:08:25.160 --> 1:08:27.080]  It's not even close.
[1:08:27.920 --> 1:08:29.520]  It's also on sale right now,
[1:08:29.520 --> 1:08:32.240]  discounted at infowarstore.com.

[1:08:35.600 --> 1:08:36.520]  So do me a favor.
[1:08:36.520 --> 1:08:37.760]  Go to infowarstore.com.

[1:08:46.480 --> 1:08:50.600]  And I'm telling you, it would make Alex rest a lot easier
[1:08:50.600 --> 1:08:52.800]  if he sees that the sales numbers
[1:08:52.800 --> 1:08:57.800]  have not totally plummeted since he took some time off.
[1:08:59.120 --> 1:09:03.280]  So infowarstore.com or we all know
[1:09:04.200 --> 1:09:07.760]  about the food shortages and the hyperinflation
[1:09:07.760 --> 1:09:10.080]  and the depression that we're entering now
[1:09:10.080 --> 1:09:13.160]  because of the Great Reset and because of Joe Biden
[1:09:13.160 --> 1:09:14.520]  and Democrat Party policy.
[1:09:14.520 --> 1:09:18.600]  So you may want to go to preparetoday.com.

[1:09:26.600 --> 1:09:28.040]  to be prepared for the worst.
[1:09:28.040 --> 1:09:31.000]  Because let me tell you, Joe Biden is pretty much the worst.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:33.440]  The Democrat Party is pretty much the worst.
[1:09:33.440 --> 1:09:36.920]  The Build Back Better Great Reset pretty much the worst.
[1:09:36.920 --> 1:09:39.560]  So are you prepared for the worst?
[1:09:39.560 --> 1:09:44.560]  You better be, preparetoday.com is the solution.

[1:09:47.960 --> 1:09:50.520]  I'm asking you to do me a favor, do Alex a favor.
[1:09:50.520 --> 1:09:54.240]  Go to infowarstore.com today.
[1:09:54.240 --> 1:09:58.200]  Make some purchases, keep info wars going strong
[1:09:58.200 --> 1:10:01.080]  so that even though Michael Jordan is out,
[1:10:01.080 --> 1:10:03.000]  we're still generating good revenue
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:06.760]  to keep this franchise winning.
[1:10:06.760 --> 1:10:08.280]  Keep this franchise winning.
[1:10:08.280 --> 1:10:12.840]  All right, Tulsi Gabbard, it's really too bad.
[1:10:12.840 --> 1:10:15.920]  She's not in Congress anymore,
[1:10:15.920 --> 1:10:18.280]  but she was on with Jesse Waters last night
[1:10:18.280 --> 1:10:20.560]  and she was talking about the double standard
[1:10:20.560 --> 1:10:23.320]  in the Democrat Party and how much it ticks her off
[1:10:23.320 --> 1:10:24.600]  in clip 16.
[1:10:25.440 --> 1:10:28.600]  Congresswoman, how does it make you feel
[1:10:28.600 --> 1:10:30.360]  when you see people just get away with things?
[1:10:30.360 --> 1:10:34.160]  If your mug shot was out from a DUI mine, come on.
[1:10:34.160 --> 1:10:36.280]  It would be out there or you smoke crack,
[1:10:36.280 --> 1:10:39.600]  waved around the loaded hot gun in front of a prostitute.
[1:10:39.600 --> 1:10:42.800]  You think you'd be able to get away with that, Tulsi?
[1:10:42.800 --> 1:10:43.640]  The answer is no,
[1:10:43.640 --> 1:10:45.600]  but also I would never do any of those things.
[1:10:45.600 --> 1:10:48.520]  First of all, let's just put that out there straight.
[1:10:48.520 --> 1:10:50.520]  Thanks for clearing that up.
[1:10:50.520 --> 1:10:52.360]  It pisses me off, you know?
[1:10:52.360 --> 1:10:55.040]  It is this double standard that you're talking about
[1:10:55.040 --> 1:10:59.040]  between those in power and then there's the rest of us.
[1:10:59.040 --> 1:11:01.520]  We see it in all the examples that you showed here.
[1:11:01.520 --> 1:11:05.400]  We see it with this insider trading that Pelosi does
[1:11:05.400 --> 1:11:07.040]  and has been doing for quite some time,
[1:11:07.040 --> 1:11:09.880]  but is also very blatantly advocating for.
[1:11:09.880 --> 1:11:11.520]  I introduced legislation in Congress
[1:11:11.520 --> 1:11:14.960]  to prohibit members of Congress and their spouses
[1:11:14.960 --> 1:11:17.320]  from trading in stocks, period,
[1:11:17.320 --> 1:11:19.360]  for even any perception of insider trading
[1:11:19.360 --> 1:11:21.000]  because your job is to serve the people
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:24.160]  and not cushion your own bank account.
[1:11:24.160 --> 1:11:26.760]  But one of the hypocritical things I see,
[1:11:26.760 --> 1:11:27.840]  you pointed out a number of them,
[1:11:27.840 --> 1:11:29.640]  one of the hypocritical things I see here
[1:11:29.640 --> 1:11:32.040]  is that President Biden's administration
[1:11:32.040 --> 1:11:35.320]  take a lot of time touting how great our democracy
[1:11:35.320 --> 1:11:37.680]  is around the world and how we follow the rule of law
[1:11:37.680 --> 1:11:40.080]  and so on and so forth and that autocracies
[1:11:40.080 --> 1:11:44.200]  with oligarchs should look to us to copy what we do.
[1:11:44.200 --> 1:11:47.840]  And yet we have this living example of the oligarchs
[1:11:47.840 --> 1:11:51.320]  of America in people like Pelosi and Joe Biden
[1:11:51.320 --> 1:11:54.840]  and Hunter Biden showing exactly
[1:11:54.840 --> 1:11:57.320]  what our democracy should not be.
[1:11:57.320 --> 1:12:00.480]  If you're some king or some psycho autocrat
[1:12:00.480 --> 1:12:02.280]  and you see some of the crooked stuff
[1:12:02.280 --> 1:12:04.760]  that's going on in this country with Hunter,
[1:12:04.760 --> 1:12:07.760]  the money, with Pauly Pay, all this stuff,
[1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:11.120]  you got political opponents being shackled
[1:12:11.120 --> 1:12:14.200]  with leg irons hauled off a plane, come on,
[1:12:14.200 --> 1:12:17.280]  you can't make hand of that in a little propaganda piece.
[1:12:17.280 --> 1:12:18.720]  Exactly, and if you describe that
[1:12:18.720 --> 1:12:21.560]  without talking about names or where it was taking place,
[1:12:21.560 --> 1:12:23.440]  that's what a normal person would think,
[1:12:23.440 --> 1:12:25.040]  like what foreign country is this happening?
[1:12:25.040 --> 1:12:26.800]  And because that's not the America
[1:12:26.800 --> 1:12:28.040]  our founders envisioned for us,
[1:12:28.040 --> 1:12:31.480]  that's not what we are supposed to be about in this country
[1:12:31.480 --> 1:12:33.640]  and that's where it's so disheartening to see
[1:12:33.640 --> 1:12:36.400]  that the very people we have in charge
[1:12:36.400 --> 1:12:39.320]  are the ones dishonoring that vision our founders had
[1:12:39.320 --> 1:12:40.440]  and abusing that power.
[1:12:40.440 --> 1:12:42.200]  Yeah, I mean, we couldn't get the mugshot
[1:12:42.200 --> 1:12:44.880]  so we had to do a sketch.
[1:12:44.880 --> 1:12:46.800]  Some of the producers put together a sketch
[1:12:46.800 --> 1:12:50.480]  of what we think maybe the mugshot would look like.
[1:12:50.480 --> 1:12:51.560]  And we'll show that for you,
[1:12:51.560 --> 1:12:53.080]  we put it up earlier in the week.
[1:12:53.080 --> 1:12:55.200]  And this Amanda woman who runs
[1:12:55.200 --> 1:12:57.440]  the California Highway Patrol.
[1:12:57.440 --> 1:12:59.080]  Oh, I've got news on her coming up.
[1:12:59.080 --> 1:13:00.720]  You can't have someone, there she is,
[1:13:00.720 --> 1:13:02.640]  you can't have someone arrested.
[1:13:02.640 --> 1:13:04.520]  And if you, you know, there are numbers up
[1:13:04.520 --> 1:13:06.200]  if you're interested in who we are
[1:13:06.200 --> 1:13:08.480]  and getting the mugshot and the body cam footage,
[1:13:08.480 --> 1:13:10.600]  you know, that's how you contact her.
[1:13:10.600 --> 1:13:12.240]  It's a political position.
[1:13:12.240 --> 1:13:15.160]  Obviously knows she's got a little hot potato
[1:13:15.160 --> 1:13:17.400]  sitting in the department's office
[1:13:17.400 --> 1:13:21.880]  and she can't not know that they're not releasing it.
[1:13:21.880 --> 1:13:23.760]  I mean, we've been banging the door down
[1:13:23.760 --> 1:13:24.960]  so what is she hiding?
[1:13:24.960 --> 1:13:26.640]  Yeah, I mean, that is the real question.
[1:13:26.640 --> 1:13:27.800]  When you're showing that picture
[1:13:27.800 --> 1:13:29.720]  and you're looking at this person
[1:13:29.720 --> 1:13:31.200]  who's in a leadership position
[1:13:31.200 --> 1:13:32.960]  of those who wear the uniform
[1:13:32.960 --> 1:13:35.720]  who are charged with enforcing the law
[1:13:35.720 --> 1:13:37.720]  and you see this intentional cover up,
[1:13:37.720 --> 1:13:41.680]  you see this very direct and blatant abuse of power
[1:13:41.680 --> 1:13:44.560]  is exactly why people start to lose faith
[1:13:44.560 --> 1:13:46.400]  and trust in these institutions
[1:13:46.400 --> 1:13:48.720]  that are supposed to represent the rule of law
[1:13:48.720 --> 1:13:51.600]  and that are supposed to represent the best public interests,
[1:13:51.600 --> 1:13:54.160]  not the interests of Nancy Pelosi and her husband.
[1:13:54.160 --> 1:13:55.840]  All right, Tulsi Gabbard, thank you so much.
[1:13:55.840 --> 1:13:56.680]  Thanks, Jesse.
[1:13:56.680 --> 1:13:57.880]  All right, coming up.
[1:13:57.880 --> 1:13:58.760]  So there you go.
[1:13:58.760 --> 1:14:01.680]  Man, now you see why they kept Tulsi Gabbard
[1:14:01.680 --> 1:14:03.280]  off the Democrat debate stage.
[1:14:03.280 --> 1:14:04.640]  Remember that?
[1:14:04.640 --> 1:14:06.560]  Remember Tulsi running for president as a Democrat?
[1:14:06.560 --> 1:14:08.360]  They kept her off the debate stage?
[1:14:09.320 --> 1:14:11.880]  Yeah, I think it's pretty obvious.
[1:14:11.880 --> 1:14:13.480]  We know why.
[1:14:13.480 --> 1:14:14.520]  Is Tulsi Gabbard perfect?
[1:14:14.520 --> 1:14:15.360]  Absolutely not.
[1:14:15.360 --> 1:14:16.280]  Do I agree with all of her stances?
[1:14:16.280 --> 1:14:17.680]  Absolutely not.
[1:14:17.680 --> 1:14:21.560]  But is she a complete dishonest, lying criminal?
[1:14:21.560 --> 1:14:23.040]  Like most Democrats?
[1:14:23.040 --> 1:14:24.760]  Absolutely not.
[1:14:24.760 --> 1:14:27.760]  And that's why they kept her off the debate stage.
[1:14:27.760 --> 1:14:30.680]  That's why they couldn't let Tulsi Gabbard have her time.
[1:14:31.600 --> 1:14:33.920]  Maybe she'll try to come back.
[1:14:33.920 --> 1:14:36.200]  But see, they let Bernie Sanders get his time
[1:14:36.200 --> 1:14:37.400]  because they know at the end of the day,
[1:14:37.400 --> 1:14:39.360]  Bernie Sanders is gonna lay down
[1:14:39.360 --> 1:14:41.440]  to whatever the Democrats want him to do.
[1:14:41.440 --> 1:14:45.280]  But I've got other news updates coming
[1:14:46.720 --> 1:14:49.240]  in the next segment in regards to what she was just talking
[1:14:49.240 --> 1:14:50.080]  about with the double standards.
[1:14:50.080 --> 1:14:53.160]  But quickly here, we do have multiple caravans
[1:14:53.160 --> 1:14:54.160]  heading to the Southern border.
[1:14:54.160 --> 1:14:56.880]  Here's an image of one of them that's on the way.
[1:14:56.880 --> 1:15:01.000]  There's multiple caravans like this, 10,000 plus strong.
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:02.160]  They're all on their way.
[1:15:03.600 --> 1:15:07.360]  10,000 people a day illegally cross the US border.
[1:15:07.360 --> 1:15:09.320]  The Border Patrol under Biden is actually
[1:15:09.320 --> 1:15:12.240]  just a trafficking organization now.
[1:15:12.240 --> 1:15:15.440]  It's actually just a human trafficking element now.
[1:15:15.440 --> 1:15:17.000]  And I'm not blaming Border Patrol.
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:18.040]  They were put in this position.
[1:15:18.040 --> 1:15:19.720]  But here's Beto O'Rourke.
[1:15:19.720 --> 1:15:22.840]  He's on the campaign trail in clip three.
[1:15:22.840 --> 1:15:26.860]  Beto, Bob, I'm just gonna call him Bob O'Rourke.
[1:15:26.860 --> 1:15:27.880]  That's his real name.
[1:15:27.880 --> 1:15:28.800]  Bob O'Rourke.
[1:15:28.800 --> 1:15:31.880]  How are we looking there at the Southern border?
[1:15:31.880 --> 1:15:34.320]  We all agree that we want the border to be better.
[1:15:34.320 --> 1:15:37.480]  In fact, I think the border is pretty great right now.
[1:15:37.480 --> 1:15:39.120]  Oh, okay.
[1:15:39.120 --> 1:15:42.800]  So two million illegal immigrant entries a year.
[1:15:42.800 --> 1:15:45.960]  Two million criminal illegal immigrant entries a year
[1:15:45.960 --> 1:15:49.840]  is a good thing according to Bob O'Rourke.
[1:15:49.840 --> 1:15:52.720]  Bob O'Rourke running for governor.
[1:15:52.720 --> 1:15:54.440]  You know why they get so mad when you don't call him Beto?
[1:15:54.440 --> 1:15:55.440]  Because they know that's a fake name.
[1:15:55.440 --> 1:15:58.520]  And his name's Bob.

[1:17:07.720 --> 1:17:11.000]  and override the sensors has been Patriot apparel

[1:17:13.520 --> 1:17:16.760]  and so we can push people to websites like InfoWars.com
[1:17:16.760 --> 1:17:18.800]  so they can understand the globalist plan
[1:17:18.800 --> 1:17:19.880]  and how to stop it.

[1:19:59.240 --> 1:20:02.080]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[1:20:02.080 --> 1:20:05.680]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:05.680 --> 1:20:16.320]  number five
[1:20:30.880 --> 1:20:34.440]  Brazil's presidentricting Bolsonaro Cast doubt
[1:20:34.440 --> 1:20:42.200]  doubt on Joe Biden's 2020 election win. He's about to meet with him too. Oh really? You
[1:20:42.200 --> 1:20:47.640]  mean the guy that couldn't fill a broom closet? The guy that had to cancel presidential debates?
[1:20:47.640 --> 1:20:53.040]  The guy who got called out for being racist and too old on the Democrat debate stage?
[1:20:53.040 --> 1:20:59.000]  The guy who didn't ever win a debate? Got more votes than Obama? You believe that, huh?
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:04.840]  You must be a liberal Democrat if you believe that. Bolsonaro knows better. So interesting
[1:21:04.840 --> 1:21:11.120]  commentary coming from him before he meets with Joe Biden. But yeah, I mean if you don't
[1:21:11.120 --> 1:21:17.720]  question Joe Biden's election victory, you're a brainwashed fool. But you know, here's the
[1:21:17.720 --> 1:21:27.000]  answer. Otero County, New Mexico, and this may still be live guys. I actually checked
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:34.920]  it out this morning, just briefly. But Otero County, New Mexico, meeting live stream now,
[1:21:34.920 --> 1:21:44.360]  hearing to remove voting machines from elections. To remove voting machines from elections.
[1:21:44.360 --> 1:21:51.960]  That's again, you know, it's look, there's things that happen in life where the solution
[1:21:51.960 --> 1:22:00.160]  to problems are not good. But it's the solution after all. And if you don't enact the solution,
[1:22:00.160 --> 1:22:07.080]  well then the problem is worse, right? So, I mean, here's a personal example. You've
[1:22:07.080 --> 1:22:11.240]  got gout or gangrene or something on your leg and the doctor tells you you're going
[1:22:11.240 --> 1:22:15.560]  to have to amputate that leg or it's going to kill you. But do you want to not have a
[1:22:15.560 --> 1:22:21.320]  leg? Absolutely not. But do you want to die? No. So you're amputating that leg. School
[1:22:21.320 --> 1:22:27.280]  shootings. Okay, we want to stop school shootings. Let's put an armed guard or multiple armed
[1:22:27.280 --> 1:22:32.320]  guards at the schools. Do we want that? Do we like that we have to have armed guards at
[1:22:32.320 --> 1:22:37.240]  schools? Do we want a military zone in a school? No, absolutely not. But is it going to stop
[1:22:37.240 --> 1:22:43.920]  the next school shooting? It will. So we go with it. Same thing with the voting machines.
[1:22:43.920 --> 1:22:50.000]  Do we want to hand count ballots? Do we want to do hand counting of millions of paper ballots
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:55.080]  for our elections? No. We have technology and that's very, really painstaking and it
[1:22:55.080 --> 1:22:59.280]  takes a long time. We'd rather not do that. But if that's the only way to make sure we
[1:22:59.280 --> 1:23:05.280]  have real elections that aren't rigged, then yeah, let's do that. So that's the, that's
[1:23:05.280 --> 1:23:10.720]  the hearing that's going on right now in New Mexico. Two Utah moms file open records request
[1:23:10.720 --> 1:23:15.840]  on election records. Democrats didn't like that. State Lieutenant Governor tips off
[1:23:15.840 --> 1:23:22.160]  reporter and blocks them from accessing them and then calls in the feds. Oh, you want to
[1:23:22.160 --> 1:23:24.960]  look into Democrats cheating in elections? Don't worry, the feds are going to be breathing
[1:23:24.960 --> 1:23:31.200]  down your neck threatening you the next day. Hunter Biden's hookers. There's plenty of
[1:23:31.200 --> 1:23:39.520]  those. Hunter Biden's favorite Las Vegas hooker got $20,000 federal PPP loan for female-owned
[1:23:39.520 --> 1:23:47.600]  sole proprietorship after Joe Biden took office. That's an expensive hooker. $20,000 for Hunter's
[1:23:47.600 --> 1:23:53.120]  favorite hooker. You think Joe got a little side job there too? Do you think Hunter and
[1:23:53.120 --> 1:24:04.560]  Joe are Eskimo brothers? I better stop because I could go real dark with that. But I know
[1:24:04.560 --> 1:24:09.080]  Hunter is Eskimo brothers with his deceased brother because he was sleeping with his sister
[1:24:09.080 --> 1:24:13.800]  in law and Joe Biden said that was a good thing. And of course, we know about Joe Biden
[1:24:13.800 --> 1:24:20.160]  showering with his daughter. And appropriately, she wrote about that in her diary. So $20,000
[1:24:20.160 --> 1:24:27.720]  from the government to Hunter Biden's hooker must be great. You know the old movie? It's
[1:24:27.720 --> 1:24:31.360]  Good to Be King or what's called the King and Me and they have that song. It's Good
[1:24:31.360 --> 1:24:36.680]  to Be King. It's good to be a Democrat. It's good to be a Biden. You can rape, pillage,
[1:24:36.680 --> 1:24:42.640]  plunder, and nothing happens to you like Paul Pelosi. Donald Trump Jr. asked the question.
[1:24:42.640 --> 1:24:47.760]  Did anyone really believe that Paul Pelosi would face any consequence at all for his
[1:24:47.760 --> 1:24:53.120]  DUI crash? Anyone who's been paying attention knows that the rules don't apply to Democrats.
[1:24:53.120 --> 1:25:02.880]  They just want you to abide by what they say, not what they do, recurring theme. And here's
[1:25:02.880 --> 1:25:13.720]  some of the numbers. Here's some of the numbers here on perhaps why Paul Pelosi's mugshot
[1:25:13.720 --> 1:25:20.520]  and DUI were never, never a thing never happened. Just completely memory hold Gavin Newsom appointed
[1:25:20.520 --> 1:25:28.480]  California Highway Patrol Commissioner Amanda Ray. She receives more than $250,000 in her
[1:25:28.480 --> 1:25:36.720]  yearly salary. She gets bonuses of $76,000 plus a year. And she also receives more than
[1:25:36.720 --> 1:25:43.960]  $145,000 in benefits per year. So a yearly salary for the Highway Patrol Commissioner
[1:25:43.960 --> 1:25:53.120]  Amanda Ray is almost $500,000. She knows where her bread is buttered. She knows who signs
[1:25:53.120 --> 1:26:02.000]  her paychecks. It's the Democrats. Still wonder why Paul Pelosi's DUI case was dropped. Still
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:08.520]  wonder. Oh, but she's the first black woman. Ooh, first black woman has nothing to do
[1:26:08.520 --> 1:26:13.040]  with skin color has nothing to do with woman. It has to do with, are you a good Democrat?
[1:26:13.040 --> 1:26:18.800]  Will you protect our own? Will you let Democrats get away with crimes? The answer is yes. The
[1:26:18.800 --> 1:26:30.560]  proof is Paul Pelosi. Now, remember, an innocent man once again, an innocent Democrats going
[1:26:30.560 --> 1:26:35.480]  after innocent people left and right. Believe me, I know all about that. I'm one of them.
[1:26:35.480 --> 1:26:43.520]  Peter Navarro. Now, folks, this is such a weird thing. So first of all, they go after
[1:26:43.520 --> 1:26:50.520]  Peter Navarro for contempt of court because he won't turn over executive records. But
[1:26:50.520 --> 1:26:59.360]  here's the problem. It Peter Navarro can't turn over executive records. Only Donald Trump
[1:26:59.360 --> 1:27:04.760]  can turn over those records. So they demand all these records from Navarro. Peter Navarro
[1:27:04.760 --> 1:27:09.880]  with his lawyers say, Hey, look, maybe they want to cooperate. Maybe they don't. But they
[1:27:09.880 --> 1:27:15.360]  say, Hey, look, all the records you requested, we can't give them to you. We don't have the
[1:27:15.360 --> 1:27:19.680]  executive privilege. If you want these records, you have to get them from Donald Trump. You
[1:27:19.680 --> 1:27:23.680]  can't get them from us. If we release them to you, that would be illegal. That would
[1:27:23.680 --> 1:27:27.400]  be treason. So no, we're not releasing the executive records. That would be breaking
[1:27:27.400 --> 1:27:30.880]  the law. You have to go for Donald Trump. So the Democrats say, Okay, you're not going
[1:27:30.880 --> 1:27:34.280]  to release the executive records. We're just going to arrest you then and hold you in contempt
[1:27:34.280 --> 1:27:39.440]  of court. You won't break the law for Democrats. So they arrest you and hold you in contempt
[1:27:39.440 --> 1:27:46.760]  of court. But see, Peter Navarro wasn't intimidated and wasn't silenced. So he was talking to
[1:27:46.760 --> 1:27:52.720]  the media. He was doing TV interviews. So now they're gagging him. Biden's DOJ applies
[1:27:52.720 --> 1:27:58.600]  for gag order on indicted Trump advisor Peter Navarro over claims he is creating a carnival
[1:27:58.600 --> 1:28:04.800]  atmosphere with his media appearances and accusing the FBI of a terrorist strategy.
[1:28:04.800 --> 1:28:13.160]  You mean the FBI that tried to kidnap Governor Whitmer? That FBI? Remember they had the
[1:28:13.160 --> 1:28:18.720]  Justice for January 6th event earlier this year. And there are some Trump supporters
[1:28:18.720 --> 1:28:24.120]  out there. And the Capitol police were so desperate to find an armed Trump supporter.
[1:28:24.120 --> 1:28:28.800]  They arrested a couple armed individuals at the Justice for J6 rally. The problem was
[1:28:28.800 --> 1:28:36.800]  they were feds. Feds. So now they're so afraid of Peter Navarro talking that they're trying
[1:28:36.800 --> 1:28:45.120]  to have a gag order placed on him. What? Folks, we're not in America anymore. We're in, we're
[1:28:45.120 --> 1:28:52.240]  in an authoritarian dictatorship with an evil corrupt entity, a terroristic hate group called
[1:28:52.240 --> 1:28:59.240]  the Democrat Party. And they're purging anyone that's not a Democrat from the FBI.
[1:29:22.240 --> 1:29:35.120]  So now, the fight's out in the open. They're making their move because they know they're
[1:29:35.120 --> 1:29:39.360]  behind schedule. We're going to win this thing. God's watching the children counting on us.
[1:29:39.360 --> 1:29:42.840]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and
[1:29:42.840 --> 1:29:46.760]  your financial support because without you, info wars would not be here. I just want you
[1:29:46.760 --> 1:29:51.720]  to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are the reason humanity
[1:29:51.720 --> 1:29:55.960]  has a fighting chance. So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done
[1:29:55.960 --> 1:30:25.920]  and asked you now to redouble your efforts.
[1:30:26.760 --> 1:30:29.840]  and order your high quality, swirable food right now and ready to ship to you and your
[1:30:29.840 --> 1:30:33.900]  family with the inflation happening with the food shortages, with the wars, with the collapse
[1:30:33.900 --> 1:30:38.960]  and wars, everything is happening is the most important as you can make is to have that
[1:30:38.960 --> 1:30:41.680]  quality, swirable food, water filtration, air filtration and more. And it's not just
[1:30:41.680 --> 1:30:46.020]  those items. It's hundreds of other high quality preparedness items and survival items right
[1:30:46.020 --> 1:30:52.600]  now and prepare with Alex comm that again redirects to prepare today.com. I would not
[1:30:52.600 --> 1:30:55.100]  procrastinate, ladies and gentlemen, one of the most important things you can do is get
[1:30:55.100 --> 1:30:58.180]  to get ahead of inflation now because inflation is just beginning.
[1:30:58.180 --> 1:31:01.980]  You know, it's going back to what we all thought was going to happen in the 90s when the internet
[1:31:01.980 --> 1:31:05.700]  and mobile technology first came out, which is we thought, you know, this is going to
[1:31:05.700 --> 1:31:07.100]  level the playing field.
[1:31:07.100 --> 1:31:09.460]  Everybody's going to have access to the same information and everybody's going to be able
[1:31:09.460 --> 1:31:12.260]  to freely communicate that information.
[1:31:12.260 --> 1:31:18.220]  That's our goal, to get back to that place where we all have access to all of the information.
[1:31:18.220 --> 1:31:23.260]  We all have the ability to freely communicate that information with whomever we want, whenever
[1:31:23.260 --> 1:31:28.140]  we want, and we don't have to worry about anybody tracking what we're doing and trying
[1:31:28.140 --> 1:31:35.380]  to judge us or categorize us or figure out some way to go after us because of the conversations
[1:31:35.380 --> 1:31:40.380]  we're having, because of the internet searches that we're doing, because of the discussions,
[1:31:40.380 --> 1:31:42.860]  the people we want to talk to about these things.
[1:31:42.860 --> 1:31:47.060]  So that's our goal, is to help people take back their freedom by helping them to take
[1:31:47.060 --> 1:31:48.060]  back their privacy.
[1:31:48.060 --> 1:31:53.420]  And so that's really what we're trying to do, and so I hope that everybody listening will
[1:31:53.420 --> 1:31:58.460]  check us out at boltowireless.com, that's B-O-L-T-A, wireless.com.
[1:31:58.460 --> 1:32:03.780]  The first ten amendments to our country's constitution were adopted in 1791.
[1:32:03.780 --> 1:32:08.700]  The first of these broadly protects the rights of free speech and free press.
[1:32:08.700 --> 1:32:14.940]  Free speech means the free and public expression of opinions without censorship, interference
[1:32:14.940 --> 1:32:18.140]  and restraint by the government.
[1:32:18.140 --> 1:32:23.940]  231 years later, free speech across America is under chronic and insidious attack.
[1:32:23.940 --> 1:32:26.640]  GCN is under attack.
[1:32:26.640 --> 1:32:31.260]  Your freedom is currently under siege from those who do not want you to know the truth.
[1:32:31.260 --> 1:32:37.420]  I'm asking our fellow broadcasters and you to rise up and help us defend our right to
[1:32:37.420 --> 1:32:39.660]  continue telling you the truth.
[1:32:39.660 --> 1:32:41.100]  Would you like to join us?

[1:32:55.860 --> 1:32:59.340]  I'm Vincent Finnelli.
[1:32:59.340 --> 1:33:22.460]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:22.460 --> 1:33:31.260]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:31.260 --> 1:33:35.620]  Welcome back to this live Thursday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:35.620 --> 1:33:40.140]  Owen Schroder is about to take over with more breaking news and guests and your calls here
[1:33:40.140 --> 1:33:41.140]  in a moment.
[1:33:41.140 --> 1:33:46.180]  But I wanted to just make a very, very important and a very exciting announcement.
[1:33:46.180 --> 1:33:49.980]  We're living in critical times, we're living in historic times but I can tell you that
[1:33:49.980 --> 1:33:54.900]  while I'm on the road, the public is even more elected than they've ever been.
[1:33:54.900 --> 1:34:00.740]  Black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young, you name it, I have been mobbed while I've
[1:34:00.740 --> 1:34:07.420]  been on the road on this business trip here on the West Coast and it has been just very,
[1:34:07.420 --> 1:34:10.660]  very heartening to see this happen.
[1:34:10.660 --> 1:34:16.180]  Almost everybody I talk to says, hey, because the mainstream media attacked you and demonized
[1:34:16.180 --> 1:34:19.940]  you, I went to check out who you were in the last few years.
[1:34:19.940 --> 1:34:22.780]  In research what you were saying and found out it was true and now I'm telling everybody
[1:34:22.780 --> 1:34:28.780]  else about the broadcast, they said when the system is so corrupted, so evil and they're
[1:34:28.780 --> 1:34:33.460]  attacking somebody, we know you must be good and then we went and checked you out and found
[1:34:33.460 --> 1:34:34.860]  out you were.
[1:34:34.860 --> 1:34:39.460]  So the good news is, people are really waking up, the bad news is the globalists know that
[1:34:39.460 --> 1:34:42.180]  and they're making their move right now.
[1:34:42.180 --> 1:34:46.220]  Now that said, they have a plan to slowly cut off the food and the energy, we're already
[1:34:46.220 --> 1:34:51.300]  deep into that operation to bring people to their knees so they can bring in their great
[1:34:51.300 --> 1:34:53.900]  reset and their build back better program.
[1:34:53.900 --> 1:34:58.020]  That's why we've got to continue to expose their agenda and that it's the deboss group
[1:34:58.020 --> 1:35:02.580]  and the globalists that are behind this or they'll be able to pose as the saviors and
[1:35:02.580 --> 1:35:04.580]  sell the next leg of their operation.
[1:35:04.580 --> 1:35:10.100]  Now everybody knows that, you don't need me to tell you that, but the point is the general
[1:35:10.100 --> 1:35:12.620]  public has not completely figured that out yet.
[1:35:12.620 --> 1:35:15.860]  When they do, it's game over for the new world order.
[1:35:15.860 --> 1:35:19.900]  Now here's a really important announcement I want to make, we've been selling high quality
[1:35:19.900 --> 1:35:22.100]  storeable food for over a decade.
[1:35:22.100 --> 1:35:25.860]  We've been partnering with my Patriots supply, the biggest and best outfit out there with
[1:35:25.860 --> 1:35:28.780]  quality food, the lowest price you're going to find to get quality food.
[1:35:28.780 --> 1:35:33.300]  You can find stuff that's cheaper, but it's not nearly as good and they almost always
[1:35:33.300 --> 1:35:37.460]  make you wait months to get it and in many cases you don't even get it.
[1:35:37.460 --> 1:35:39.500]  With my Patriot, you get it.
[1:35:39.500 --> 1:35:43.420]  That's because they've got warehouses all over the US, they buy food a year out with
[1:35:43.420 --> 1:35:48.460]  their contracts, they have been pre-positioned to not have to raise prices while everybody
[1:35:48.460 --> 1:35:50.900]  else has been having to raise prices.
[1:35:50.900 --> 1:35:54.540]  The last time they raised prices was just a little bit a year ago.
[1:35:54.540 --> 1:35:58.100]  They are going to have to raise prices soon because the inflation as you know and the
[1:35:58.100 --> 1:36:02.760]  food shortages are accelerating, but they have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
[1:36:02.760 --> 1:36:08.260]  quality food items in stock, stockpiled and for the next few months they are going to
[1:36:08.260 --> 1:36:10.740]  be able to ship within days.
[1:36:10.740 --> 1:36:17.500]  Their orders coming in to preparetoday.com are shipping within 24 hours unless you order
[1:36:17.500 --> 1:36:20.540]  like on a Saturday then it will be 48 hours.
[1:36:20.540 --> 1:36:24.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, you need to take action right now.
[1:36:24.540 --> 1:36:27.460]  This funds the operation, but that's secondary.
[1:36:27.460 --> 1:36:32.220]  The system wants you dependent on them and the only way to beat inflation is to buy high
[1:36:32.220 --> 1:36:38.220]  quality storeable food and other items that you can use in the future that you buy at
[1:36:38.220 --> 1:36:39.900]  a lower price today.
[1:36:39.900 --> 1:36:45.980]  So it's streamlined, it's all on one site, they run the whole thing, it's their entire
[1:36:45.980 --> 1:36:51.620]  back end, it's their entire spectrum of products, hundreds and hundreds of not just high quality
[1:36:51.620 --> 1:36:55.620]  storeable foods but other preparedness and survival items at the lowest prices you're
[1:36:55.620 --> 1:37:02.620]  going to find because they are able to buy it in bulk and then pass those savings on
[1:37:02.620 --> 1:37:03.620]  to you.
[1:37:03.620 --> 1:37:10.860]  If you have a total 360 win, go to preparetoday.com or follow the link, preparewithalex.com that
[1:37:10.860 --> 1:37:16.260]  also takes you there and you will find all these great items that are ready to ship to
[1:37:16.260 --> 1:37:17.260]  you right now.
[1:37:17.260 --> 1:37:21.220]  So you'll save money on inflation, you'll be prepared and not dependent on the system
[1:37:21.220 --> 1:37:27.780]  and you'll help keep them for wars on the year at this critical time at preparetoday.com.
[1:37:27.780 --> 1:37:33.180]  Now in a few months there may be a couple week wait to get your food and that's why
[1:37:33.180 --> 1:37:39.020]  the last three months I stopped promoting food because a wait was developing for the
[1:37:39.020 --> 1:37:40.660]  first time in many years.
[1:37:40.660 --> 1:37:43.860]  Most places are completely sold out and can't even really take your order.
[1:37:43.860 --> 1:37:49.420]  Now the food is in stock, it's stockpiled, it's been processed and it's ready to ship
[1:37:49.420 --> 1:37:56.300]  to you very, very quickly at again preparetoday.com.
[1:37:56.300 --> 1:38:01.300]  Hyperinflation is expanding, food shortages are increasing, the baby formula is just the
[1:38:01.300 --> 1:38:06.660]  beginning, dozens and dozens of plants have been burned up or exploded, not just here
[1:38:06.660 --> 1:38:07.980]  but also in Europe.
[1:38:07.980 --> 1:38:12.100]  This is a strategic globalist plan to bring down civilization and they think we're going
[1:38:12.100 --> 1:38:14.900]  to be caught flat footed but our listeners are not.
[1:38:14.900 --> 1:38:20.220]  So again a 360 win at preparetoday.com.
[1:38:20.220 --> 1:38:24.220]  Also you can visit infowarstore.com, there's a link to the site there but we are not selling
[1:38:24.220 --> 1:38:29.100]  the food now at infowarstore.com that way we don't have to take the order and then have
[1:38:29.100 --> 1:38:34.180]  them drop ship it, that way it goes right through preparetoday.com but then info wars
[1:38:34.180 --> 1:38:36.980]  hits the credit and some of the funding to keep us on air.
[1:38:36.980 --> 1:38:41.660]  So please go to preparetoday.com and I'm going to hand them a time back to Owen Schroyer
[1:38:41.660 --> 1:38:43.860]  live from Austin, Texas.
[1:38:43.860 --> 1:38:50.460]  Thank you Alex and we're back here live in the info wars world headquarters and I've
[1:38:50.460 --> 1:38:55.300]  got Clay Clark with me for this and the next segment and then he's going to be taking over
[1:38:55.300 --> 1:39:01.740]  hosting the third hour with a great guest Dr. Jim Meehan.
[1:39:01.740 --> 1:39:06.540]  Wow Clay, so much, so much developing right now.
[1:39:06.540 --> 1:39:13.620]  I do have some questions and vaccine topics and monkeypox topics for you but what's on
[1:39:13.620 --> 1:39:14.620]  your radar?
[1:39:14.620 --> 1:39:18.060]  What's your big story at Thrive Time Show?
[1:39:18.060 --> 1:39:21.940]  Well you know I made a, when I want to get prepared for your audience so I had 17 talking
[1:39:21.940 --> 1:39:22.940]  points ready to go.
[1:39:22.940 --> 1:39:24.100]  I'll just hit a couple of them.
[1:39:24.100 --> 1:39:28.500]  The first one is there's this document called the nuclear threat initiative, an organization
[1:39:28.500 --> 1:39:32.340]  called the nuclear threat initiative that put out a document which all your listeners
[1:39:32.340 --> 1:39:36.580]  go there right now, go to time2freeamerica.com and click on the monkey face button.
[1:39:36.580 --> 1:39:40.220]  There's a face of a monkey, you click the monkey face, it's the monkeypox button and
[1:39:40.220 --> 1:39:43.460]  you click there and you can read the document that was created by the nuclear threat initiative
[1:39:43.460 --> 1:39:45.420]  15 months ago.
[1:39:45.420 --> 1:39:50.300]  And this particular document when you click it, if you go to page 12, it says that there
[1:39:50.300 --> 1:39:56.180]  will be a monkeypox outbreak beginning in America, beginning in the world, you'll start
[1:39:56.180 --> 1:40:03.780]  to see it in the world beginning May 15th, May 15th of 2022 and it's starting June 5th
[1:40:03.780 --> 1:40:08.500]  of 2022 it will reach an all out outbreak status.
[1:40:08.500 --> 1:40:13.260]  And so seemingly in disbelief, oh and this was sent to me 12 months ago and I didn't
[1:40:13.260 --> 1:40:16.940]  want to believe it, I received it from a listener and I read the document and I thought well
[1:40:16.940 --> 1:40:19.100]  I'm going to look into this organization.
[1:40:19.100 --> 1:40:23.860]  It was founded 21 years ago, it's funded by Bill and Melinda Gates, it was allegedly
[1:40:23.860 --> 1:40:31.020]  started by Ted Turner, you know Ted Turner and this organization is located in Washington
[1:40:31.020 --> 1:40:35.100]  DC and so I read the document and I thought you know what, I'm not even going to go down,
[1:40:35.100 --> 1:40:37.340]  I don't want to be taught, I don't want to scare people, I don't want to talk about
[1:40:37.340 --> 1:40:41.500]  monkeypox and the next outbreak until we get through the COVID outbreak and let's just
[1:40:41.500 --> 1:40:43.260]  see if this actually happens.
[1:40:43.260 --> 1:40:47.260]  And then Carter to my right, you work in our office, Carter helps process ticket requests
[1:40:47.260 --> 1:40:51.900]  and Carter lo and behold, what started happening about two weeks ago as it relates to monkeypox.
[1:40:51.900 --> 1:40:56.100]  Oh a lot of stories started popping up about you know monkeypox outbreak here, monkeypox
[1:40:56.100 --> 1:40:57.100]  outbreak there.
[1:40:57.100 --> 1:41:00.700]  And it's happening everywhere and so all of a sudden if you go to Google right now
[1:41:00.700 --> 1:41:04.940]  or duck duck go and you type monkeypox and you click on news, you're going to see that's
[1:41:04.940 --> 1:41:07.620]  the story and oh and I'm going to tell your listeners out there, this is the argument
[1:41:07.620 --> 1:41:09.140]  that's being made right now.
[1:41:09.140 --> 1:41:13.460]  The World Health Organization is saying that they have teamed up with all these countries,
[1:41:13.460 --> 1:41:18.940]  these strategic partners and they've all agreed that in the event of outbreak of any kind,
[1:41:18.940 --> 1:41:23.980]  they all need to team up together to stop an outbreak no matter where in the world the
[1:41:23.980 --> 1:41:28.580]  outbreak begins because an outbreak in any country is a threat to all countries and so
[1:41:28.580 --> 1:41:33.300]  therefore the World Health Organization is setting up the narrative to deploy foreign
[1:41:33.300 --> 1:41:40.580]  assets into sovereign nations to stop the spread of a monkeypox outbreak and so right
[1:41:40.580 --> 1:41:43.940]  now people are going to time-to-freeamerica.com and they're asking me, they're saying are
[1:41:43.940 --> 1:41:46.660]  you still going to do the reawaken America tour in Virginia?
[1:41:46.660 --> 1:41:50.060]  I mean I know you guys have a packed lineup and Zalinko's coming and Eric Trump's coming
[1:41:50.060 --> 1:41:51.900]  but what about monkeypox?
[1:41:51.900 --> 1:41:55.300]  But Carter, we're going to do the event regardless of monkeypox.
[1:41:55.300 --> 1:41:56.300]  Right.
[1:41:56.300 --> 1:42:00.060]  Well and let's be clear here Clay, they're lying, the World Health Organization is lying
[1:42:00.060 --> 1:42:04.220]  because monkeypox is a regular thing in Africa.
[1:42:04.220 --> 1:42:07.460]  You go look at Africa right now, there's all kinds of cases of monkeypox there has been
[1:42:07.460 --> 1:42:13.460]  for years but you know I'm going to add another little element to your thought process here.
[1:42:13.460 --> 1:42:18.580]  It comes off of this headline, monkeypox patient says he caught virus after having gay sex
[1:42:18.580 --> 1:42:21.660]  with around 10 new partners.
[1:42:21.660 --> 1:42:27.860]  Monkeypox outbreak linked to gay sex during gay pride month, I don't know, maybe just
[1:42:27.860 --> 1:42:28.860]  another coincidence.
[1:42:28.860 --> 1:42:34.500]  Oh and I always tell my office staff, I say guys there's two rules, one be on time to
[1:42:34.500 --> 1:42:38.580]  work and two, don't engage in illicit gay sex because it may cause monkeypox.
[1:42:38.580 --> 1:42:42.860]  So that's a rule, we feel safe about that here at the Thrive Time Show, we feel good
[1:42:42.860 --> 1:42:47.700]  about it but I encourage everybody out there, don't engage in homosexual, bisexual, orgies
[1:42:47.700 --> 1:42:51.060]  especially with somebody who has monkeypox, that's just a kind of a pro tip there and
[1:42:51.060 --> 1:42:54.580]  be on time to work, oh and I can't wait to harass your listeners after the break.
[1:42:54.580 --> 1:42:58.940]  We'll be right back with Clay Clark, don't go anywhere.
[1:42:58.940 --> 1:43:04.940]  I don't care if you work at a cafeteria or a pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a rancher,
[1:43:04.940 --> 1:43:08.660]  a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire, Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles,
[1:43:08.660 --> 1:43:09.660]  you see it every year.
[1:43:09.660 --> 1:43:14.740]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers
[1:43:14.740 --> 1:43:20.460]  and almost all of them just screw you over especially the big firms and the big tax groups
[1:43:20.460 --> 1:43:24.060]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding
[1:43:24.060 --> 1:43:25.060]  this and knowing this.
[1:43:25.060 --> 1:43:30.660]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[1:43:30.660 --> 1:43:35.900]  to be able to do things tax wise, it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of
[1:43:35.900 --> 1:43:36.900]  your money.
[1:43:36.900 --> 1:43:41.660]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[1:43:41.660 --> 1:43:48.780]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com, one word, jonestaxrelief.com
[1:43:48.780 --> 1:44:03.060]  or call 833-904-285 833-904-285.
[1:44:03.060 --> 1:44:06.460]  Granny Do Right, Granny Do Right, thanks for holding her on the air, go ahead.
[1:44:06.460 --> 1:44:12.340]  Challenge, first of all let me say I love your products, I am a granny and for all the senior
[1:44:12.340 --> 1:44:17.780]  citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots
[1:44:17.780 --> 1:44:23.300]  or H-spots as they're lovingly called but since taking your X2 for the last couple of years
[1:44:23.300 --> 1:44:26.460]  my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[1:44:26.460 --> 1:44:32.420]  People think I'm 55 years old and I was already taking your other supplements but I thought
[1:44:32.420 --> 1:44:36.300]  you know well maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless
[1:44:36.300 --> 1:44:40.660]  situation but when I started taking it, I mean it doesn't happen immediately but you
[1:44:40.660 --> 1:44:46.900]  know over a period of time I started noticing okay you know this is a ticket, this is working,
[1:44:46.900 --> 1:44:53.380]  this is wonderful you know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore you know so anyway
[1:44:53.380 --> 1:44:57.900]  it works wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[1:45:07.900 --> 1:45:12.260]  William of California, people are asleep and programmed controlled, I agree, how do you
[1:45:12.260 --> 1:45:13.820]  make the sleeper awaken William?
[1:45:13.820 --> 1:45:17.820]  Oh hi Alex, thanks for taking my call, can I plug Alex real quick?
[1:45:17.820 --> 1:45:18.820]  Yeah go ahead.
[1:45:18.820 --> 1:45:24.780]  Hey I'm in my 60s and I did the work of 25, 30 year olds and I worked them into the ground
[1:45:24.780 --> 1:45:29.100]  and you wanted to know why and I've tested this and I've taken your B12 and let me tell
[1:45:29.100 --> 1:45:35.260]  you when I don't take it, I pay a price, I really do, I take that B12 and I am electric
[1:45:35.260 --> 1:45:40.700]  man, I can run 10 miles, I did some pretty heavy work with the highway department and
[1:45:40.700 --> 1:45:46.820]  my friends will attest to the fact that yeah for a guy in his 60s you know pushing 70 and
[1:45:46.820 --> 1:45:50.700]  I know I'm not just blowing smoke here, the B12 saves my life.
[1:45:58.700 --> 1:46:02.460]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported InfoWars financially with
[1:46:02.460 --> 1:46:04.420]  word of mouth and prayer.
[1:46:04.420 --> 1:46:07.820]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists and the fact that we're not
[1:46:07.820 --> 1:46:12.380]  caught flat footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[1:46:12.380 --> 1:46:14.380]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.

[1:46:59.420 --> 1:47:28.580]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:28.580 --> 1:47:33.860]  We're here on the Alex Jones show, Owen Schreuer filling in, Clay Clark is with us, Dr. Jim
[1:47:33.860 --> 1:47:38.860]  Meehan is with us, ThriveTimeShow.com is where you can find them, so many other great sources
[1:47:38.860 --> 1:47:46.700]  Clay has, the host of the Reawaken America Tour to inform Americans and you know another,
[1:47:46.700 --> 1:47:51.860]  we're talking about monkey pox, is this going to be the new thing they use to control people
[1:47:51.860 --> 1:47:58.100]  and it seems that they're covering their tracks better this time.
[1:47:58.100 --> 1:48:04.420]  Here's an example, NIH erased web page details, monkey pox vaccine biotera research praised
[1:48:04.420 --> 1:48:10.800]  by Anthony Fauci, so when they launched their fake COVID pandemic, we had all the paper
[1:48:10.800 --> 1:48:16.660]  trails leading back to Fauci and the Wuhan lab and everything else, well now it seems
[1:48:16.660 --> 1:48:21.060]  they're erasing, they're quickly erasing the paper trails of all their monkey pox research
[1:48:21.060 --> 1:48:26.020]  and their monkey pox vaccine research and everything, if and when the case is there's
[1:48:26.020 --> 1:48:30.740]  a monkey pox outbreak, we won't be able to go back and find all the evidence that like
[1:48:30.740 --> 1:48:35.420]  we found with COVID, it goes right to the lab, it goes right to Fauci.
[1:48:35.420 --> 1:48:38.940]  Your thoughts on this, Clay Clark and Dr. Jim Meehan with us now.
[1:48:38.940 --> 1:48:44.260]  Well, I think what's happening here is Dr. Jim Meehan to my right, how he and I really
[1:48:44.260 --> 1:48:48.460]  got connected is that I had listeners to listen to our ThriveTimeShow and we were one of the
[1:48:48.460 --> 1:48:53.580]  top talk business radio shows in Tulsa, Oklahoma for three consecutive years running opposite
[1:48:53.580 --> 1:48:57.540]  of Rush Limbaugh on a different station and our listeners would start to call me and they
[1:48:57.540 --> 1:49:01.540]  would say, hey, I recognize that you're saying the models that said the 2.2 million Americans
[1:49:01.540 --> 1:49:05.580]  would die from COVID, those are false, the PCR tests, the polymerase chain reaction tests
[1:49:05.580 --> 1:49:10.740]  are falsely calibrated and that COVID-19 is 100% treatable with butycinide, ivermectin
[1:49:10.740 --> 1:49:13.820]  and hydroxychloroquine, people said that you're the only show that I know on the radio that's
[1:49:13.820 --> 1:49:17.300]  talking about this, however I can't find a freaking doctor that's willing to treat my
[1:49:17.300 --> 1:49:19.940]  wife or myself if I have COVID-19.
[1:49:19.940 --> 1:49:25.340]  So Dr. Meehan here from mehanmd.com, he has been treated, he treated over 10,000 COVID
[1:49:25.340 --> 1:49:30.980]  patients with zero deaths and now the phone started to ring about monkeypox and so Dr.
[1:49:30.980 --> 1:49:36.340]  Meehan has the research he's been doing for over 20 years that a lot of it, he's downloaded
[1:49:36.340 --> 1:49:40.700]  and he's archived, he has the PDF so in the event that they try to remove the evidence,
[1:49:40.700 --> 1:49:45.540]  he has this but this is clearly part of a pandemic that everybody can read, you can
[1:49:45.540 --> 1:49:50.500]  read the documentation, you can see the plan by going to time2freeamerica.com and clicking
[1:49:50.500 --> 1:49:51.500]  on the monkeypox button.
[1:49:51.500 --> 1:49:54.700]  Dr. Meehan, what do you think about this monkeypox outbreak?
[1:49:54.700 --> 1:49:59.220]  Well, personally I think it's a distraction, it's an intermediary, if they were losing
[1:49:59.220 --> 1:50:04.580]  the narrative with coronaviruses, we were all tiring of the nonsense, the lockdowns,
[1:50:04.580 --> 1:50:08.700]  the masking and everything that was, the science was eventually, the truth was outing the fact
[1:50:08.700 --> 1:50:12.660]  that everything that they were doing was wrong, that they lost that narrative.
[1:50:12.660 --> 1:50:20.140]  So here comes monkeypox, it's a very good fearmongering virus to use because it's got
[1:50:20.140 --> 1:50:25.060]  those ugly pictures of those horrible pustules but it's not highly transmissible, it's a
[1:50:25.060 --> 1:50:30.300]  large DNA virus, it's not gonna, it really is only gonna transmit during the infectious
[1:50:30.300 --> 1:50:34.220]  phase, there is no asymptomatic spread, by the way there is no asymptomatic spread for
[1:50:34.220 --> 1:50:39.540]  coronavirus either, that's another part of the narrative that was debunked by real science.
[1:50:39.540 --> 1:50:44.140]  So it's, but it's ugly and it plays well in the mainstream media.
[1:50:44.140 --> 1:50:48.980]  I think they've got something else coming because the people that, the people that paid
[1:50:48.980 --> 1:50:54.340]  and perpetrated the crime are still running the show, Anthony Fauci, the CDC and all of
[1:50:54.340 --> 1:51:00.300]  those operatives are still in place, running the show, running the gain of function research,
[1:51:00.300 --> 1:51:06.380]  they've got bio labs, perhaps 30 of them that they're trying to protect in Ukraine, I don't
[1:51:06.380 --> 1:51:12.100]  know, hypothesis opinion, but they've got bio labs that are still working on these problems.
[1:51:12.100 --> 1:51:15.540]  Oh and I have something funny for you, I know you've mentioned that they're doing a better
[1:51:15.540 --> 1:51:19.860]  job of covering their tracks but I have sort of a funny example of maybe how they're not
[1:51:19.860 --> 1:51:22.780]  doing as good of a job as maybe they should be doing.
[1:51:22.780 --> 1:51:29.220]  On June 1st, Tedros hosted a monkeypox outbreak press conference and by the way, we have some
[1:51:29.220 --> 1:51:32.860]  new characters we're gonna have to get to know, we got to know Berks before and we got to
[1:51:32.860 --> 1:51:37.820]  know Fauci but now we all need to get good at our impersonating Tedros because Tedros
[1:51:37.820 --> 1:51:40.940]  is now the hype man for the great reset.
[1:51:40.940 --> 1:51:45.700]  So he says, we're here to talk about the monkeypox and now I turn to my esteemed colleague, Dr.
[1:51:45.700 --> 1:51:50.220]  Ryan, Dr. Michael Ryan and Dr. Michael Ryan, there's a 53 minute press conference, you
[1:51:50.220 --> 1:51:54.140]  can go watch it right now on YouTube, type in World Health Organization, World Health
[1:51:54.140 --> 1:51:58.140]  Organization, you can watch the press conference, he only gets to speak for four minutes and
[1:51:58.140 --> 1:52:02.740]  this dude is fired up, okay, so oh and listen to what he says, Dr. Michael Ryan of the world
[1:52:02.740 --> 1:52:05.900]  Health Organization, listen to what he said out loud during less than a minute, watch
[1:52:05.900 --> 1:52:08.340]  this, watch this healthy.
[1:52:08.340 --> 1:52:13.300]  This is not about stealing sovereignty from countries, this is about countries coming
[1:52:13.300 --> 1:52:19.020]  together to solve problems together, we've seen the climate change, we see what pandemics,
[1:52:19.020 --> 1:52:23.180]  there is no national solution to these, we need strong national systems and we need strong
[1:52:23.180 --> 1:52:27.300]  national commitments on climate change, we just need strong national commitments and
[1:52:27.300 --> 1:52:32.580]  preparedness but that's not enough, we need to be able to come together at a global level
[1:52:32.580 --> 1:52:36.900]  and make the necessary commitments to do the preparedness, to do the prevention, to get
[1:52:36.900 --> 1:52:40.500]  ourselves ready and to respond effectively in the next pandemic.
[1:52:40.500 --> 1:52:41.500]  That requires a degree.
[1:52:41.500 --> 1:52:44.700]  You know what they're saying, we're here to talk, listen, this is Tedros tees up the
[1:52:44.700 --> 1:52:48.060]  press conference by saying this.
[1:52:48.060 --> 1:52:52.220]  Now for an update on monkeypox, now for an update on monkeypox and then they go over
[1:52:52.220 --> 1:52:57.380]  to Dr. Michael Ryan and you know they said, listen, please don't, please avoid the keywords,
[1:52:57.380 --> 1:53:01.460]  world takeover, you know this is being transcribed, please don't say world takeover, this is what
[1:53:01.460 --> 1:53:03.300]  he says, listen to this.
[1:53:03.300 --> 1:53:09.180]  And there is no question of any loss of sovereignty or any play by global powers to take over
[1:53:09.180 --> 1:53:10.980]  the world, this is not what this is about.
[1:53:10.980 --> 1:53:16.420]  He just said, he said, it's so ridiculous because that's literally what they're doing,
[1:53:16.420 --> 1:53:22.380]  they're up here proposing that exact same thing, it's like, I mean if I, I mean I can't
[1:53:22.380 --> 1:53:26.820]  even think of a more ridiculous example, it's just on its face, it's like here we're having
[1:53:26.820 --> 1:53:30.380]  meetings talking about how we can have a global government and global health response and
[1:53:30.380 --> 1:53:33.580]  by the way, look at how we locked them down in Australia, look at how we locked them down
[1:53:33.580 --> 1:53:36.700]  in China, look at how we locked them down in Canada, look at how we shut down the businesses,
[1:53:36.700 --> 1:53:40.380]  but we're not taking away your sovereignty, come on man.
[1:53:40.380 --> 1:53:43.660]  We're here to talk about the monkeypox, Dr. Ryan, back to you.
[1:53:43.660 --> 1:53:47.140]  And Dr. Ryan's like, we're not here to talk about taking over the world.
[1:53:47.140 --> 1:53:48.140]  Yeah, this isn't about stealing your sovereignty.
[1:53:48.140 --> 1:53:49.140]  We're not here to steal your sovereignty.
[1:53:49.140 --> 1:53:52.740]  We're here and they're going, you know they're saying, stop it, we just talked about that.
[1:53:52.740 --> 1:53:55.780]  But let me just stop both of you right there because you guys are about to take over and
[1:53:55.780 --> 1:53:59.460]  host the next hour and so I know you've got a bunch of content.
[1:53:59.460 --> 1:54:05.060]  Let me just, let me just try to massage your thought here and get a response for you because
[1:54:05.060 --> 1:54:07.980]  what do you think is really going on?
[1:54:07.980 --> 1:54:10.500]  They know what they're doing.
[1:54:10.500 --> 1:54:14.660]  They know we know what they're doing and so that's why they're trying to cover up and
[1:54:14.660 --> 1:54:15.660]  lie about it.
[1:54:15.660 --> 1:54:18.380]  I mean, how bad do you think it really is?
[1:54:18.380 --> 1:54:23.500]  Do you think that they've already determined, look, the world economic system is collapsing
[1:54:23.500 --> 1:54:27.900]  so let's just speed it up, let's collapse it ourselves and then we'll sit on top of
[1:54:27.900 --> 1:54:32.340]  the rubble, we'll call it the great reset, build back better, whatever.
[1:54:32.340 --> 1:54:35.540]  Or I mean, what do you think is really driving all of this?
[1:54:35.540 --> 1:54:38.640]  Because let's not, let's assume they're lying because that's all they've done.
[1:54:38.640 --> 1:54:40.940]  So what do you think is really driving this?
[1:54:40.940 --> 1:54:43.860]  I got a 30 second little pithy response and I'll let Dr. Mehan break it down, but this
[1:54:43.860 --> 1:54:44.860]  is big.
[1:54:44.860 --> 1:54:49.820]  Michael Jordan got to a point of his game at the peak of his game, okay, where he was
[1:54:49.820 --> 1:54:53.780]  so confident that he would actually tell people, I am interested, it's all documented.
[1:54:53.780 --> 1:54:57.180]  He'll tell someone, I'm going to shoot the next free throw with my eyes closed.
[1:54:57.180 --> 1:54:59.260]  I am going to drive left on you.
[1:54:59.260 --> 1:55:01.020]  I will now drive right on you.
[1:55:01.020 --> 1:55:05.820]  And he was so confident in his game that he felt like he could just tell you what he
[1:55:05.820 --> 1:55:09.020]  was going to do and could impose his will upon you.
[1:55:09.020 --> 1:55:11.860]  Ray Lewis was like that as a linebacker.
[1:55:11.860 --> 1:55:13.780]  Tom Brady to a certain extent was like that.
[1:55:13.780 --> 1:55:17.340]  There's just certain, there's a certain level of confidence people have, okay?
[1:55:17.340 --> 1:55:18.980]  So that would be on the emotional level.
[1:55:18.980 --> 1:55:21.820]  The second is, there's a guy by the name of Robin Bullock.
[1:55:21.820 --> 1:55:25.420]  He's one of the few prophets that I know willing to call out Yuval Noah Harari.
[1:55:25.420 --> 1:55:29.620]  He's a pastor who openly speaks about Yuval Noah Harari, Klaus Schwab, Sir, and he might
[1:55:29.620 --> 1:55:31.460]  be a great guest for your show at some point.
[1:55:31.460 --> 1:55:37.820]  But he actually talks about how in the satanic realm the year 2022 is like their Super Bowl.
[1:55:37.820 --> 1:55:40.340]  This is the year they've been planning on, pushing on.
[1:55:40.340 --> 1:55:44.540]  They want to implement the implementation of the Great Reset now.
[1:55:44.540 --> 1:55:48.860]  They want to implement the dark side, they call it dark side or dark seat if you read
[1:55:48.860 --> 1:55:50.580]  the Jack Kirby comic series.
[1:55:50.580 --> 1:55:55.660]  But this was a plan launched in 1971, the World Economic Forum was founded in 1971.
[1:55:55.660 --> 1:55:59.460]  We got off the gold standard in 1971, both things happened per the recommendation of
[1:55:59.460 --> 1:56:00.460]  Henry Kissinger.
[1:56:00.460 --> 1:56:03.900]  They launched a 50 year plan and their Super Bowl is right now.
[1:56:03.900 --> 1:56:05.300]  But Dr. Meehan, I'd love to get your thoughts.
[1:56:05.300 --> 1:56:09.340]  Yeah, well my thoughts are they're not confident, they're just Machiavellian sociopaths.
[1:56:09.340 --> 1:56:14.540]  They are determined to get this mass surveillance system in place.
[1:56:14.540 --> 1:56:16.700]  This is another reason to fear monger.
[1:56:16.700 --> 1:56:22.260]  This is another example of just waves of fear mongering, to control the, you know, to control
[1:56:22.260 --> 1:56:26.540]  the population, to terrorize them into a place of isolation again.
[1:56:26.540 --> 1:56:30.140]  They're re-implementing the mask mandates, all the things that didn't work before.
[1:56:30.140 --> 1:56:35.180]  They're going to try to foist upon us again and they're consolidating power.
[1:56:35.180 --> 1:56:38.860]  Waves of fear, this is a distraction, I'm worried about what comes next.
[1:56:38.860 --> 1:56:42.060]  And I think what comes next will hit us in September or October.
[1:56:42.060 --> 1:56:46.940]  It'll be another weaponized virus and here it comes again.
[1:56:46.940 --> 1:56:48.620]  But it's all about this mass surveillance.
[1:56:48.620 --> 1:56:54.500]  What they need is the tech to connect us to the hive mind, to know where we are, what
[1:56:54.500 --> 1:56:58.460]  we're doing and be able to control the population from that standpoint.
[1:56:58.460 --> 1:57:02.020]  This is just another way to drive into that end game for them.
[1:57:02.020 --> 1:57:04.420]  And back to that, that hive mind thing briefly here.
[1:57:04.420 --> 1:57:07.340]  You've all know Hararhee, he said this out loud during an interview.
[1:57:07.340 --> 1:57:09.020]  They said, what's COVID-19 really all about?
[1:57:09.020 --> 1:57:10.420]  And he said this out loud.
[1:57:10.420 --> 1:57:18.700]  The COVID-19 crisis could be a really watershed moment, a moment of significant change in
[1:57:18.700 --> 1:57:25.940]  the history of surveillance because surveillance is being revolutionized, transformed from
[1:57:25.940 --> 1:57:30.220]  over the skin surveillance to under the skin surveillance.
[1:57:30.220 --> 1:57:33.660]  And let's just go to break like this and you guys take over.
[1:57:33.660 --> 1:57:38.420]  First they have to convince you you have a virus and must be controlled, then they'll
[1:57:38.420 --> 1:57:42.780]  convince you you are the virus and must be controlled and eradicated.
[1:57:42.780 --> 1:57:43.780]  That's the process we're in.
[1:57:43.780 --> 1:57:46.220]  Clay Clark, Dr. Jim Mehan, you guys take over.
[1:57:46.220 --> 1:57:52.500]  A lot of listeners have told us it's hard to find out of the thousands of great items
[1:57:52.500 --> 1:57:55.140]  at m4store.com all the storeable food.
[1:57:55.140 --> 1:57:59.100]  So we've made it easy with our great partners that supply us with the highest quality storeable
[1:57:59.100 --> 1:58:02.620]  food out there at the lowest price you're going to find for good food.

[1:58:09.660 --> 1:58:12.180]  is already unfolding with global food shortages.
[1:58:12.180 --> 1:58:17.140]  I told you over two years ago the global is going to have massive inflation and food shortages
[1:58:17.140 --> 1:58:19.620]  and it's happened just like clockwork.
[1:58:19.620 --> 1:58:22.020]  And I'm telling you it's going to get a lot worse.
[1:58:22.020 --> 1:58:23.340]  They have designed this.
[1:58:23.340 --> 1:58:28.900]  The way to beat them is to buy food now before your dollar is even more devalued.
[1:58:28.900 --> 1:58:34.580]  We're ready to ship to you right now at preparetoday.com and not just storeable food, hundreds
[1:58:34.580 --> 1:58:39.820]  of the highest quality, survival and preparedness items in stock at low prices ready to ship

[1:58:46.420 --> 1:58:47.420]  Take action.
[1:58:47.420 --> 1:58:52.820]  I designed over 200 t-shirts the last 25 years and we have some of those original designs
[1:58:52.820 --> 1:58:55.180]  still for sale at m4store.com.
[1:58:55.180 --> 1:58:56.180]  These are real classics.
[1:58:56.180 --> 1:59:00.980]  But ladies and gentlemen, they're all about to be limited edition because we're selling
[1:59:00.980 --> 1:59:02.140]  out of them.
[1:59:02.140 --> 1:59:06.900]  They're about to be history and we're selling out of the hoodies, the ball caps, the t-shirts,
[1:59:06.900 --> 1:59:12.420]  all these amazing designs at cost at m4store.com except for this fundraiser shirt that is a
[1:59:12.420 --> 1:59:13.420]  real hit.
[1:59:13.420 --> 1:59:14.420]  People love it.
[1:59:14.420 --> 1:59:15.420]  It's $24.95.
[1:59:15.420 --> 1:59:21.380]  Alex Jones is right on the front, the Red Thunderbolt and then again on the back, a big bold m4store.com.
[1:59:21.380 --> 1:59:22.380]  Exercise your First Amendment.
[1:59:22.380 --> 1:59:27.700]  Don't let the leftist and the globalist bully silence you and fund the m4war at the same
[1:59:27.700 --> 1:59:28.700]  time.
[1:59:28.700 --> 1:59:32.580]  This shirt is not a more politically incorrect shirt that sends a stronger message of freedom
[1:59:32.580 --> 1:59:37.140]  resistance to the new world order than the Alex Jones was right shirt exclusively available
[1:59:37.140 --> 1:59:38.140]  at m4store.com.
[1:59:38.140 --> 1:59:41.380]  And again, this shirt is limited edition as well.
[1:59:41.380 --> 1:59:45.740]  We're doing one more run and then no more m4store.com.
[1:59:45.740 --> 2:00:03.180]  That's it for this year's today.
[2:00:03.180 --> 2:00:04.180]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[2:00:04.180 --> 2:00:05.180]  All right, Alex Jones fans.
[2:00:05.180 --> 2:00:06.180]  I am not Alex Jones.
[2:00:06.180 --> 2:00:09.340]  I've been working on a pretty good Alex Jones impersonation though.
[2:00:09.340 --> 2:00:12.260]  So Dr. Jimmy, are you ready to be on the Alex Jones show?
[2:00:12.260 --> 2:00:13.260]  Yes, I am Alex.
[2:00:13.260 --> 2:00:16.860]  Okay, so I'm excited to be filling in for Alex Jones when I'm going to try to do today.
[2:00:16.860 --> 2:00:20.500]  I can't fill the shoes of the great Alex Jones, but what I can do is drop some knowledge bombs.
[2:00:20.500 --> 2:00:23.740]  So I'm going to drop 17 knowledge bombs in 60 minutes.
[2:00:23.740 --> 2:00:29.620]  So knowledge bomb number one, Dr. Mehan, when people go to time2freeamerica.com, time2freeamerica.com
[2:00:29.620 --> 2:00:33.660]  and they click on the monkey pox button, the monkey face button, they can read a document
[2:00:33.660 --> 2:00:38.220]  by the nuclear threat initiative that prophesied that there would be a or guest or predict
[2:00:38.220 --> 2:00:43.860]  there'd be a monkey pox outbreak beginning in May of 2022 and then on June 5th, 2022,
[2:00:43.860 --> 2:00:45.500]  they would be coming all out outbreak.
[2:00:45.500 --> 2:00:46.500]  What are your thoughts on that, Dr?
[2:00:46.500 --> 2:00:51.060]  Well, I mean, again, we've got the their game plan is right there in print and they're
[2:00:51.060 --> 2:00:52.980]  right on script.
[2:00:52.980 --> 2:00:57.620]  That's this is the same kind of thing we've seen from Blockstep from 2010 and the Johns
[2:00:57.620 --> 2:01:00.780]  Hopkins collaborative that was going on there.
[2:01:00.780 --> 2:01:03.260]  They've been planning this all out ahead of time.
[2:01:03.260 --> 2:01:04.260]  Read it.
[2:01:04.260 --> 2:01:07.820]  See that this is they're working from a script once again, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:01:07.820 --> 2:01:10.980]  Now, knowledge bomb number two here, I want to play this clip here.
[2:01:10.980 --> 2:01:15.580]  This comes from Dr. Michael Ryan, Dr. Michael Ryan is a top advisor at the World Health
[2:01:15.580 --> 2:01:20.300]  Organization and Tedros asked him to get behind the mic to discuss monkey pox.
[2:01:20.300 --> 2:01:24.580]  So Tedros says Dr. Michael Ryan with no disgust to monkey pox and this is what he said out
[2:01:24.580 --> 2:01:25.580]  loud.
[2:01:25.580 --> 2:01:30.500]  Dr. Michael Ryan, here listen to this and there is no question of any loss of sovereignty
[2:01:30.500 --> 2:01:34.260]  or any play by global powers to take over the world.
[2:01:34.260 --> 2:01:36.060]  This is not what this is about.
[2:01:36.060 --> 2:01:40.300]  This is about finding the necessary level of agreement to protect all of our communities
[2:01:40.300 --> 2:01:41.300]  in the future.
[2:01:41.300 --> 2:01:43.700]  How do you even process what he just said?
[2:01:43.700 --> 2:01:47.740]  I'm looking at the microfacial expressions and this guy is uncomfortable.
[2:01:47.740 --> 2:01:49.540]  He knows what he's saying is not the truth.
[2:01:49.540 --> 2:01:51.300]  He's leading with the truth.
[2:01:51.300 --> 2:01:54.380]  He's just trying to position it in an oppositional way.
[2:01:54.380 --> 2:01:56.180]  This is not about stealing your sovereignty.
[2:01:56.180 --> 2:02:01.980]  No, this is about stealing the sovereignty of other countries and thank God that it you
[2:02:01.980 --> 2:02:07.540]  know, even though our government capitulated that Africa and so many other countries stood
[2:02:07.540 --> 2:02:12.100]  their ground, freedom is still out there in the world and it's the third world that's
[2:02:12.100 --> 2:02:13.100]  defending it now.
[2:02:13.100 --> 2:02:19.740]  Now, many people reach out to your website, mihanmd all the time, mihanmd, m-e-e-h-a-n-n-d
[2:02:19.740 --> 2:02:20.740]  dot com.
[2:02:20.740 --> 2:02:23.660]  And how you and I really got connected is, you know, I told our listeners, listen, the
[2:02:23.660 --> 2:02:26.940]  models that said the 2.2 million Americans would die from COVID, those were false.
[2:02:26.940 --> 2:02:28.940]  The PCR tests are falsely calibrated.
[2:02:28.940 --> 2:02:33.340]  COVID-19 is 100% treatable using butasinide, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine and our listeners
[2:02:33.340 --> 2:02:38.220]  would say, that's great, but I can't find a doctor willing to actually treat me.
[2:02:38.220 --> 2:02:42.300]  So I would refer them to mihanmd and I encourage everyone to put that website into your phone
[2:02:42.300 --> 2:02:46.380]  right now because with the monkeypox outbreak, they're going to hype it up.
[2:02:46.380 --> 2:02:47.380]  I get it.
[2:02:47.380 --> 2:02:50.260]  But if you're looking for a doctor, you don't want to go to a doctor that's going to force
[2:02:50.260 --> 2:02:55.140]  you to take a monkeypox vaccine, God knows what's in it, or to take an RNA modifying
[2:02:55.140 --> 2:02:57.780]  nanotechnology COVID-19 vaccine just to see a doctor.
[2:02:57.780 --> 2:03:01.700]  So you want to put that in your phone, that's mihanmd.com, how many COVID patients did you
[2:03:01.700 --> 2:03:02.700]  actually treat?
[2:03:02.700 --> 2:03:06.180]  Yeah, over 10,000, many of those in the hospital too, by the way.
[2:03:06.180 --> 2:03:07.180]  How many were dying?
[2:03:07.180 --> 2:03:08.180]  Like 80% of them?
[2:03:08.180 --> 2:03:13.220]  None of our patients died, especially when you treat early or you treat with the right
[2:03:13.220 --> 2:03:14.780]  integrated approach.
[2:03:14.780 --> 2:03:19.140]  You know, ivermectin was a game changer in this pandemic.
[2:03:19.140 --> 2:03:24.100]  They've tried to dismiss it, discredit it, but it's very effective and about 300 studies
[2:03:24.100 --> 2:03:25.100]  say so.
[2:03:25.100 --> 2:03:28.980]  Now, I encourage everybody here to go look up the following thing, go to your Google
[2:03:28.980 --> 2:03:31.780]  or DuckDuckGo and type in CDC green zone.
[2:03:31.780 --> 2:03:34.220]  The CDC is recommending now green zones.
[2:03:34.220 --> 2:03:37.100]  The Centers for Disease Control is recommending green zones.
[2:03:37.100 --> 2:03:39.020]  It's the implementation of a Nazi style quarantine.
[2:03:39.020 --> 2:03:40.020]  What are your thoughts on that?
[2:03:40.020 --> 2:03:43.260]  Well, yeah, this is, you've been talking about this for a long time, Clay.
[2:03:43.260 --> 2:03:44.260]  That's what brought us together.
[2:03:44.260 --> 2:03:45.780]  We're both truth tellers.
[2:03:45.780 --> 2:03:49.300]  We go out and we find the evidence and we present it to the rest of the world.
[2:03:49.300 --> 2:03:51.060]  They want to quarantine us.
[2:03:51.060 --> 2:03:54.460]  They want to lock us down into these little, you know, Australia did it.
[2:03:54.460 --> 2:03:59.100]  If you think that this is, you know, this is unbelievable, you got to believe it.
[2:03:59.100 --> 2:04:01.100]  That's what they want to do.
[2:04:01.100 --> 2:04:02.100]  Australia did it.
[2:04:02.100 --> 2:04:04.180]  The CDC has had these plans for a long time.
[2:04:04.180 --> 2:04:07.180]  Now, as we head into the break, I want to give people a bunch of free things, a bunch
[2:04:07.180 --> 2:04:08.180]  of free tools here.
[2:04:08.180 --> 2:04:09.180]  Okay.
[2:04:09.180 --> 2:04:10.180]  So call to action number one during the break.
[2:04:10.180 --> 2:04:15.020]  I encourage you to go to timetoffreeamerica.com and you can download my ebook for free called
[2:04:15.020 --> 2:04:17.460]  The Great Reset versus The Great Reawakening.
[2:04:17.460 --> 2:04:18.460]  If you want to buy it, you can.
[2:04:18.460 --> 2:04:22.540]  You can buy it in our shopping cart at timetoffreeamerica.com, but if not, you can download it for free
[2:04:22.540 --> 2:04:25.940]  and it will walk you through the timeline of what's happening.
[2:04:25.940 --> 2:04:27.100]  Tool number two, I encourage you.
[2:04:27.100 --> 2:04:31.140]  We have a documentary called The Great Reawakening Documentary and you can watch as it features
[2:04:31.140 --> 2:04:33.340]  General Flynn, Mike Lindell, et cetera.
[2:04:33.340 --> 2:04:37.020]  You can get this 100% free by just going to timetoffreeamerica.com.
[2:04:37.020 --> 2:04:40.460]  You click on the shopping button and you can watch the documentary for free.
[2:04:40.460 --> 2:04:43.420]  And three, I encourage you to sign up for Dr. Jim Meehan's newsletter.
[2:04:43.420 --> 2:04:47.740]  It's a powerful newsletter and you need to get the truth from a doctor you can trust.
[2:04:47.740 --> 2:04:50.740]  You do not need to be listening to the mainstream media because they're going to try to scare
[2:04:50.740 --> 2:04:53.300]  you into believing that monkeypox is the most dangerous thing ever.
[2:04:53.300 --> 2:04:54.300]  Stay tuned.
[2:04:54.300 --> 2:04:57.780]  We'll be back after the break.
[2:04:57.780 --> 2:05:01.020]  PrepareToday.com.
[2:05:01.020 --> 2:05:02.780]  PrepareToday.com.
[2:05:02.780 --> 2:05:07.500]  We have created a one-stop shop to get the highest quality storeable foods ready to ship
[2:05:07.500 --> 2:05:14.260]  that are in stock with hundreds of award-winning certified preparedness survival items.

[2:05:22.900 --> 2:05:25.300]  our huge sponsor, funding or operation.
[2:05:25.300 --> 2:05:30.060]  So Americans and others can get ready, be self-sufficient, and fund the InfoAware while

[2:05:45.820 --> 2:05:46.820]  You need it.
[2:05:46.820 --> 2:05:48.740]  It was just a backup plan and insurance.
[2:05:48.740 --> 2:05:49.740]  This is an insurance.
[2:05:49.740 --> 2:05:51.140]  This is survival.

[2:06:02.940 --> 2:06:03.940]  All right.
[2:06:03.940 --> 2:06:04.940]  We're back here with Dr. Jim Meehan.
[2:06:04.940 --> 2:06:05.940]  My name is Clay Clark.
[2:06:05.940 --> 2:06:10.900]  I'm the host of the Reawake in America Tour featuring General Flynn, Donald J. Trump Jr.,
[2:06:10.900 --> 2:06:16.740]  Eric Trump, Dr. Tenpenny, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Jim Brewer, Mike Lindell, Dr. Stella
[2:06:16.740 --> 2:06:21.420]  Emanuel, Peter McCola, Dr. Judy Mikevitz, I believe Charlie Kirk is going to be joining
[2:06:21.420 --> 2:06:22.420]  us on future stops.
[2:06:22.420 --> 2:06:23.420]  He's already been to one.
[2:06:23.420 --> 2:06:28.380]  Dr. Dave Martin and Alex Jones has been on the Reawake in America Tour, and we are here
[2:06:28.380 --> 2:06:31.740]  today to drop 17 knowledge bombs you won't hear anywhere else.
[2:06:31.740 --> 2:06:32.740]  Knowledge bomb number one.
[2:06:32.740 --> 2:06:34.140]  It's called the Nuclear Threat Initiative.
[2:06:34.140 --> 2:06:36.060]  Go to Time2FreeAmerica.com.
[2:06:36.060 --> 2:06:40.420]  Everybody go to Time2FreeAmerica.com, and you will find a document there called the Nuclear
[2:06:40.420 --> 2:06:41.420]  Threat Initiative.
[2:06:41.420 --> 2:06:42.420]  Okay?
[2:06:42.420 --> 2:06:45.600]  If you just go to Time2FreeAmerica.com, click on the monkey face button.
[2:06:45.600 --> 2:06:49.820]  There you're going to see a document created by the Nuclear Threat Initiative that predicted
[2:06:49.820 --> 2:06:54.740]  a monkeypox outbreak beginning on May 15th of 2022.
[2:06:54.740 --> 2:07:00.380]  Dr. Mehan, that seems like a pretty specific guess to say that there would be an outbreak
[2:07:00.380 --> 2:07:05.500]  one, two that would happen on May 15th, and then three that it would be called monkeypox.
[2:07:05.500 --> 2:07:10.620]  This was written 15 months before the outbreak began, and the media right now, if we go to
[2:07:10.620 --> 2:07:15.380]  Google or if we go to Google and we type in monkeypox and we click on News, right now
[2:07:15.380 --> 2:07:20.180]  the media is trying to convince you that monkeypox is the most scary pandemic of all
[2:07:20.180 --> 2:07:21.180]  time.
[2:07:21.180 --> 2:07:22.180]  What are your thoughts?
[2:07:22.180 --> 2:07:25.980]  Well, number one, it's monkeypox is not a scary virus.
[2:07:25.980 --> 2:07:28.500]  There's 550 cases worldwide.
[2:07:28.500 --> 2:07:30.340]  Some of those in places that are not endemic.
[2:07:30.340 --> 2:07:35.700]  We know that the origin of that was from an international homosexual sex party thing that
[2:07:35.700 --> 2:07:36.700]  went on.
[2:07:36.700 --> 2:07:37.700]  So I would avoid those.
[2:07:37.700 --> 2:07:38.860]  That's the most important thing.
[2:07:38.860 --> 2:07:39.860]  Avoid those.
[2:07:39.860 --> 2:07:44.220]  Do not rub up against or have sex with somebody that has postural filled lesions.
[2:07:44.220 --> 2:07:47.700]  I think that should be taught to all of our children in our homes.
[2:07:47.700 --> 2:07:55.140]  But this is a large DNA virus that does not spread easily, is not aerosolizable.
[2:07:55.140 --> 2:07:57.700]  This is a, but now I have a concern.
[2:07:57.700 --> 2:08:01.260]  I have a concern that the people that are going to be most susceptible to a virus like
[2:08:01.260 --> 2:08:05.780]  monkeypox, which most people over the age of 50 have been vaccinated for smallpox and
[2:08:05.780 --> 2:08:08.500]  they will not be susceptible to monkeypox.
[2:08:08.500 --> 2:08:13.060]  You still have lifelong immunity from that smallpox vaccine.
[2:08:13.060 --> 2:08:17.700]  But the people that are susceptible are people that receive the COVID-19 vaccines, Clay.
[2:08:17.700 --> 2:08:22.660]  The COVID-19 vaccines are causing mass immune suppression in the population.
[2:08:22.660 --> 2:08:27.500]  Those people are susceptible to every virus on the planet right now.
[2:08:27.500 --> 2:08:34.380]  They're in a very difficult phase of vaccine injury that is not being talked enough about.
[2:08:34.380 --> 2:08:36.980]  Certainly it's killing tens of thousands of people.
[2:08:36.980 --> 2:08:41.500]  Vairs, the vaccine adverse event reporting system is full of vaccine deaths.
[2:08:41.500 --> 2:08:43.620]  They're trying to deny every one of those.
[2:08:43.620 --> 2:08:46.700]  That is a federally mandated legislative felonious.
[2:08:46.700 --> 2:08:49.420]  You get a felony if you miss report into that thing.
[2:08:49.420 --> 2:08:55.780]  84% of the reports and bears are from physicians and healthcare workers.
[2:08:55.780 --> 2:08:58.060]  So it's the most reliable database we have.
[2:08:58.060 --> 2:09:00.860]  There's over 28,000 deaths in that database right now.
[2:09:00.860 --> 2:09:03.980]  So right now, if you're listening right now, again, I know it's bottom number one, just
[2:09:03.980 --> 2:09:08.580]  ask yourself the question, why was this document created by the Nuclear Threat Initiative?
[2:09:08.580 --> 2:09:11.980]  Please don't believe me, download it yourself by going to time-to-freeamerica.com, clicking
[2:09:11.980 --> 2:09:13.740]  the monkey pox button.
[2:09:13.740 --> 2:09:18.780]  Two, why did Dr. Michael Ryan of the World Health Organization say during the press conference
[2:09:18.780 --> 2:09:24.220]  that the monkey pox recommended protocol is not about taking over the world?
[2:09:24.220 --> 2:09:25.220]  Yeah.
[2:09:25.220 --> 2:09:26.220]  That's the World Health Organization.
[2:09:26.220 --> 2:09:28.180]  Why did he say out loud that this is not about taking over the world?
[2:09:28.180 --> 2:09:30.740]  If you missed that clip, folks, let me play it for you real quick.
[2:09:30.740 --> 2:09:33.940]  Again, this is Dr. Michael Ryan of the World Health Organization.
[2:09:33.940 --> 2:09:39.740]  He's saying out loud at a press conference that occurred there at the World Health Organization
[2:09:39.740 --> 2:09:44.620]  on June 1 that the attempt to stop the monkey pox outbreak is not about taking over the
[2:09:44.620 --> 2:09:45.620]  world.
[2:09:45.620 --> 2:09:46.620]  Listen to this.
[2:09:46.620 --> 2:09:53.020]  And there is no question of any loss or sovereignty or any play by global powers to take over
[2:09:53.020 --> 2:09:54.020]  the world.
[2:09:54.020 --> 2:09:55.020]  This is not what this is about.
[2:09:55.020 --> 2:09:56.020]  Okay.
[2:09:56.020 --> 2:09:57.020]  Well, it's interesting he would say that.
[2:09:57.020 --> 2:09:58.020]  Okay.
[2:09:58.020 --> 2:09:59.020]  Knowledge bomb number three.
[2:09:59.020 --> 2:10:00.820]  Why does the CDC recommend Nazi-style green zones?
[2:10:00.820 --> 2:10:05.900]  If you haven't seen it, folks, go to Google or DuckDuckGo, type in CDC green zones and
[2:10:05.900 --> 2:10:06.900]  read it yourself.
[2:10:06.900 --> 2:10:09.380]  There's a Nazi-style quarantine camps.
[2:10:09.380 --> 2:10:15.180]  Knowledge bomb number four, Klaus Schwab and Yuval Noah Harari are obsessed with putting
[2:10:15.180 --> 2:10:16.900]  surveillance under your skin.
[2:10:16.900 --> 2:10:19.220]  They're actually now saying it out loud.
[2:10:19.220 --> 2:10:24.460]  Listen to the audio of Yuval Noah Harari, the lead advisor for Klaus Schwab.
[2:10:24.460 --> 2:10:29.700]  This is a man praised by Obama, Zuckerberg, Gates, MIT, Stanford, Harvard.
[2:10:29.700 --> 2:10:30.700]  They love this guy.
[2:10:30.700 --> 2:10:31.700]  He is their guru.
[2:10:31.700 --> 2:10:32.700]  They even call him the prophet.
[2:10:32.700 --> 2:10:33.700]  Listen to Yuval Noah Harari.
[2:10:33.700 --> 2:10:45.660]  The COVID-19 crisis could be a really watershed moment, a moment of significant change in
[2:10:45.660 --> 2:10:52.900]  the history of surveillance because surveillance is being revolutionized, transformed from
[2:10:52.900 --> 2:10:57.380]  over-the-skin surveillance to under-the-skin surveillance.
[2:10:57.380 --> 2:11:04.980]  Previously, governments were collecting data about what we do, who we meet, where we go,
[2:11:04.980 --> 2:11:06.660]  what we watch on television.
[2:11:06.660 --> 2:11:14.220]  Now, with this epidemic, they increasingly focus on what's happening inside our body.
[2:11:14.220 --> 2:11:18.340]  What's our blood pressure, our body temperature, our heart rate?
[2:11:18.340 --> 2:11:21.140]  Now, this can be used, of course, to identify-
[2:11:21.140 --> 2:11:22.740]  Okay, so let's just be real about this.
[2:11:22.740 --> 2:11:24.620]  Okay, folks, I'm going to hold the book cover up.
[2:11:24.620 --> 2:11:28.060]  COVID-19 stands for Certificate of Vaccination I.D.A.I.
[2:11:28.060 --> 2:11:29.420]  Klaus Schwab wrote this book.
[2:11:29.420 --> 2:11:31.180]  It's called COVID-19, The Great Reset.
[2:11:31.180 --> 2:11:36.380]  COVID-19, The Great Reset is all about putting RNA-modifying nanotechnology inside the human
[2:11:36.380 --> 2:11:40.860]  body, but more importantly, it's about a certificate of vaccination I.D.A.I.
[2:11:40.860 --> 2:11:44.460]  So I encourage everybody right now, we have to pick a side.
[2:11:44.460 --> 2:11:45.820]  I encourage everybody right now.
[2:11:45.820 --> 2:11:50.380]  This is why this is so vitally important that you show up at one of these reawaken America
[2:11:50.380 --> 2:11:53.180]  tour events, regardless of where in the country you are.
[2:11:53.180 --> 2:11:57.020]  Okay, the next one's in Virginia, and people always ask me, you know, why are you doing
[2:11:57.020 --> 2:11:58.020]  these events?
[2:11:58.020 --> 2:12:01.060]  Or they'll say, how much does Dr. Jim Meehan get paid to speak?
[2:12:01.060 --> 2:12:02.700]  He doesn't take a speaking fee.
[2:12:02.700 --> 2:12:10.780]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, speaking, why are these people coming to these events to share the
[2:12:10.780 --> 2:12:11.780]  truth?
[2:12:11.780 --> 2:12:12.780]  I'll tell you why.
[2:12:12.780 --> 2:12:15.700]  It's because it's the Great Reawakening versus The Great Reset.
[2:12:15.700 --> 2:12:19.660]  And if you go to time-to-freeamerica.com, we have 997 tickets remaining right now for
[2:12:19.660 --> 2:12:20.660]  Virginia Beach.
[2:12:20.660 --> 2:12:24.700]  And if you ask me, are you still going to do the reawaken America tour despite the Monkey
[2:12:24.700 --> 2:12:25.700]  Pox outbreak?
[2:12:25.700 --> 2:12:26.700]  Absolutely.
[2:12:26.700 --> 2:12:27.700]  We're going to do it.
[2:12:27.700 --> 2:12:32.540]  In fact, that's why we're doing the reawaken America tour, is to wake people up to the deception
[2:12:32.540 --> 2:12:34.340]  and the Great Reset agenda.
[2:12:34.340 --> 2:12:36.500]  Next question I have for you, Knowledge Bomb Number 5.
[2:12:36.500 --> 2:12:42.820]  Why is Congress working on legislation called HR666 and HR6666?
[2:12:42.820 --> 2:12:46.820]  If we can pull it up on the screen, it's HR6666.
[2:12:46.820 --> 2:12:52.500]  This is 4-6s, 4-6s right now, and meanwhile, read this legislation, folks.
[2:12:52.500 --> 2:12:57.660]  Just go to Google or DuckDuckGo, type in HR6666, and I'm going to read it to you.
[2:12:57.660 --> 2:13:01.820]  It says, to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants to eligible
[2:13:01.820 --> 2:13:07.580]  entities to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID-19 and activities such as contact tracing
[2:13:07.580 --> 2:13:14.620]  through mobile health units as necessary at individuals, residences, and for other purposes.
[2:13:14.620 --> 2:13:18.700]  Now, Dr. Meehan, the German panel, a German panel right now, just met, this just came
[2:13:18.700 --> 2:13:24.540]  out at 9.27 a.m. today, Germany's independent vaccine advisory panel is recommending that
[2:13:24.540 --> 2:13:30.660]  shots against Monkey Pox be prioritized for people recently exposed to the virus.
[2:13:30.660 --> 2:13:34.580]  They're already pushing the Monkey Pox shots on the virus, they're already suggesting
[2:13:34.580 --> 2:13:37.860]  it might, you might not be able to go around others unless you've been vaccinated.
[2:13:37.860 --> 2:13:40.020]  Dr. Meehan, what are your thoughts?
[2:13:40.020 --> 2:13:45.060]  Well, number one, I'm very concerned about vaccinating in the midst, in the midst of
[2:13:45.060 --> 2:13:49.100]  a widespreading virus, especially with a live virus vaccine.
[2:13:49.100 --> 2:13:54.100]  So everybody needs to understand that the smallpox and the vaccines are live viruses.
[2:13:54.100 --> 2:14:00.220]  There is a thing called recombination rescue in which a wild type virus and interfacing
[2:14:00.220 --> 2:14:06.580]  with an attenuated virus can rescue and eliminate the attenuation, can cause a recombination
[2:14:06.580 --> 2:14:11.020]  that can create a new infectious version of that virus.
[2:14:11.020 --> 2:14:16.100]  We could create in the midst of a, vaccinating in the midst of a pandemic, if such a thing
[2:14:16.100 --> 2:14:19.860]  with Monkey Pox were to occur, we could create greater problems.
[2:14:19.860 --> 2:14:25.380]  I will, you know, this is opinion, but I will, my opinion is that we have been creating the
[2:14:25.380 --> 2:14:30.980]  childhood hepatitis problem has been created because the Oxford and the Johnson and Johnson
[2:14:30.980 --> 2:14:39.380]  vaccines, using that adenovirus vector, and adenoviruses are broad in the population, wild
[2:14:39.380 --> 2:14:46.140]  type adenovirus, you get, you vaccinate somebody with J&J or the Oxford adenovirus vaccine,
[2:14:46.140 --> 2:14:48.180]  they encounter the wild type virus.
[2:14:48.180 --> 2:14:54.420]  Those two viruses can exchange pieces, parts, and create functionality that was not there
[2:14:54.420 --> 2:14:55.420]  before.
[2:14:55.420 --> 2:14:59.060]  So that's not being talked enough about, but it's being talked enough.
[2:14:59.060 --> 2:15:00.660]  You're just not being talked about.
[2:15:00.660 --> 2:15:02.640]  You're just not hearing enough about this.
[2:15:02.640 --> 2:15:04.580]  So we have a real concern here.
[2:15:04.580 --> 2:15:08.700]  I think that they are, everything that they've been doing throughout the pandemic has no
[2:15:08.700 --> 2:15:10.340]  basis in science.
[2:15:10.340 --> 2:15:12.500]  It's creating more harm than good.
[2:15:12.500 --> 2:15:19.060]  That's my central concern about vaccinating more smallpox vaccinations in the midst of
[2:15:19.060 --> 2:15:22.340]  an active viral spread in some populations.
[2:15:22.340 --> 2:15:29.060]  We may create another nightmarish, you know, chimera virus that kind of brings smallpox
[2:15:29.060 --> 2:15:30.340]  back into the population.
[2:15:30.340 --> 2:15:32.260]  I encourage everybody here during the break.
[2:15:32.260 --> 2:15:37.460]  I encourage you to go up right now to band.video, band.video, and buy anything.
[2:15:37.460 --> 2:15:41.060]  Alex Jones has been in the fight, in the trenches for a long, long time.
[2:15:41.060 --> 2:15:42.180]  I'm late to the party.
[2:15:42.180 --> 2:15:45.380]  I'm honored to be guest hosting, but go in there and just buy anything.
[2:15:45.380 --> 2:15:48.300]  I always tell people what better way to, but what better time of the year to start your
[2:15:48.300 --> 2:15:51.340]  Christmas shopping than on June 9th at 1.15 PM.
[2:15:51.340 --> 2:15:53.700]  Buy anything from Alex Jones right now during the break.
[2:15:53.700 --> 2:15:55.180]  We'll come back after the break.
[2:15:55.180 --> 2:15:56.180]  Very proud.
[2:15:56.180 --> 2:16:00.700]  InfoWars has made history.
[2:16:00.700 --> 2:16:06.260]  You have made history in your support of InfoWars, and one of the biggest tools we've had to circumvent
[2:16:06.260 --> 2:16:10.860]  and override the sensors has been patriot, apparel, so we can identify each other, so
[2:16:10.860 --> 2:16:15.580]  we can spread the word, and so we can push people to websites like infowars.com so they
[2:16:15.580 --> 2:16:18.220]  can understand the globalist plan and how to stop it.
[2:16:18.220 --> 2:16:21.500]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, two months ago we announced we're blowing out of all of our

[2:17:59.780 --> 2:18:03.780]  the internet and mobile technology first came out, which is, we thought, you know, this
[2:18:03.780 --> 2:18:05.460]  is going to level the playing field.
[2:18:05.460 --> 2:18:07.740]  Everybody's going to have access to the same information, and everybody's going to be
[2:18:07.740 --> 2:18:10.620]  able to freely communicate that information.
[2:18:10.620 --> 2:18:16.580]  That's our goal, to get back to that place where we all have access to all of the information.
[2:18:16.580 --> 2:18:21.620]  We all have the ability to freely communicate that information with whomever we want, whenever
[2:18:21.620 --> 2:18:26.500]  we want, and we don't have to worry about anybody tracking what we're doing and trying
[2:18:26.500 --> 2:18:33.740]  to judge us or categorize us or figure out some way to go after us because of the conversations
[2:18:33.740 --> 2:18:38.740]  we're having, because of the internet searches that we're doing, because of the discussions,
[2:18:38.740 --> 2:18:41.220]  the people we want to talk to about these things.
[2:18:41.220 --> 2:18:45.420]  So that's our goal, is to help people take back their freedom by helping them to take
[2:18:45.420 --> 2:18:46.740]  back their privacy.
[2:18:46.740 --> 2:18:51.380]  And so that's really what we're trying to do, and so I hope that everybody listening

[2:19:17.300 --> 2:19:23.020]  sold out of 300,000 of a similar offering that was 40% more than what we're selling

[2:20:27.740 --> 2:20:32.160]  to address that and just kind of tell you who we have confirmed to speak at the Reawakened
[2:20:32.160 --> 2:20:36.620]  America Tour in Virginia Beach, so I'm going to pull up the final agenda.

[2:21:57.060 --> 2:21:58.060]  Do we have psychopaths?

[2:21:59.460 --> 2:22:01.060]  What kind of people are reaching out for tickets?
[2:22:01.060 --> 2:22:03.700]  We have awesome American patriots ready to learn the truth.
[2:22:03.700 --> 2:22:07.340]  And how does the pricing structure work, because people want to know, again, we get attacked
[2:22:07.340 --> 2:22:10.860]  by the mainstream media, we let people name their price, but how does it work?
[2:22:10.860 --> 2:22:14.380]  Well, we've got lots of different options for them, so we've got our VIP, where you
[2:22:14.380 --> 2:22:18.980]  sit down in front, that's $500, we've got general admission for $250, and then our scholarships
[2:22:18.980 --> 2:22:20.460]  are truly name your price.
[2:22:20.460 --> 2:22:23.140]  So if I want to sit in the general admission section, what's the least amount of money
[2:22:23.140 --> 2:22:24.140]  I can pay?
[2:22:24.140 --> 2:22:26.980]  Well, the least amount that you want to pay, I mean, we've done-
[2:22:26.980 --> 2:22:29.140]  What's the least amount you've ever sold a ticket for?
[2:22:29.140 --> 2:22:30.140]  $6.
[2:22:30.140 --> 2:22:31.140]  That's a good deal.
[2:22:31.140 --> 2:22:33.380]  Now, Carter Bled, so you're talking to people around the clock, people are reaching out
[2:22:33.380 --> 2:22:34.380]  all the time.
[2:22:34.380 --> 2:22:38.100]  By the way, folks, if you want to get those tickets again, go to Time2FreeAmerica.com,
[2:22:38.100 --> 2:22:50.620]  or you can text the number, 918-851-0102, 918-851-0102, again, the number, 918-851-0102.
[2:22:50.620 --> 2:22:53.420]  You understand, President Trump has seven people close to him.
[2:22:53.420 --> 2:22:58.900]  He has his wife, Eric Trump, Donald J. Trump Jr., Cash Patel, he has a general Michael
[2:22:58.900 --> 2:23:03.780]  Flynn, he's got these, these, Peter Navarro, and these people have all basically been on
[2:23:03.780 --> 2:23:04.780]  the tour.
[2:23:04.780 --> 2:23:07.580]  So if you want to meet the people who are actually at the tip of the spear fighting with
[2:23:07.580 --> 2:23:11.700]  President Donald J. Trump for the very preservation of our freedoms throughout the world, you
[2:23:11.700 --> 2:23:13.340]  got to go to Time2FreeAmerica.com.
[2:23:13.340 --> 2:23:15.460]  Carter, how does the ticket pricing work?
[2:23:15.460 --> 2:23:16.460]  Somebody out there says, I don't get it.
[2:23:16.460 --> 2:23:17.460]  How does it work?
[2:23:17.460 --> 2:23:18.460]  All right.
[2:23:18.460 --> 2:23:19.620]  So we have a couple of different options.
[2:23:19.620 --> 2:23:23.260]  We have the VIP, which is going to get you the exclusive seating down front, along with
[2:23:23.260 --> 2:23:27.140]  a VIP shirt and a copy of Clay's latest book, Fair and Mass 2.0.
[2:23:27.140 --> 2:23:28.780]  Those are $500.
[2:23:28.780 --> 2:23:30.580]  We do have some promo codes, as you said before.
[2:23:30.580 --> 2:23:33.900]  We have general admission at $250, and then we have our scholarship tickets as well so
[2:23:33.900 --> 2:23:35.100]  people can pay what they want.
[2:23:35.100 --> 2:23:37.260]  We want this information in the years of everyone.
[2:23:37.260 --> 2:23:40.780]  What's the lowest you've sold a ticket for, lowest price?
[2:23:40.780 --> 2:23:43.980]  I'll go with $6.50, so slightly higher than Sarah's price.
[2:23:43.980 --> 2:23:44.980]  OK.
[2:23:44.980 --> 2:23:45.980]  So I want to make sure we get this.
[2:23:45.980 --> 2:23:49.020]  Anybody who can attend these events, my wife and I, we don't take any income or salary
[2:23:49.020 --> 2:23:50.100]  from these events.
[2:23:50.100 --> 2:23:51.940]  We just want to get the truth out there.
[2:23:51.940 --> 2:23:57.740]  So I encourage you folks to go to Time2FreeAmerica.com, Virginia Beach, July 8th and 9th, 997 tickets
[2:23:57.740 --> 2:23:58.740]  remaining.
[2:23:58.740 --> 2:23:59.740]  New York, New York.
[2:23:59.740 --> 2:24:01.340]  We're going to Rochester, New York, folks.
[2:24:01.340 --> 2:24:04.500]  In August, we have just under 2,500 tickets remaining for that.
[2:24:04.500 --> 2:24:05.860]  And now back to the Knowledge Bombs.
[2:24:05.860 --> 2:24:07.780]  Thank you, Carter and Sarah, for joining us there.
[2:24:07.780 --> 2:24:09.900]  People have some questions, so back to the show.
[2:24:09.900 --> 2:24:10.900]  Here we go.
[2:24:10.900 --> 2:24:14.620]  Now, people want to know what's going on with the satanic agenda.
[2:24:14.620 --> 2:24:16.020]  What is going on with the satanic agenda?
[2:24:16.020 --> 2:24:20.500]  So I encourage everybody, go to Google right now and type in, into Google right now, type
[2:24:20.500 --> 2:24:22.620]  in Google Chrome logo 666.
[2:24:22.620 --> 2:24:25.540]  Again, folks, type in Google Chrome logo 666.
[2:24:25.540 --> 2:24:30.660]  Now, Dr. Mian, I'm going to pull it up for you, and I'm going to ask you the same question.
[2:24:30.660 --> 2:24:34.300]  Why does the Google Chrome logo have a 666?
[2:24:34.300 --> 2:24:35.300]  What's that all about?
[2:24:35.300 --> 2:24:38.820]  Yeah, it's all about the symbolism of those that serve Satan.
[2:24:38.820 --> 2:24:41.460]  Why did they name their operating system Adreno?
[2:24:41.460 --> 2:24:42.460]  Adreno.
[2:24:42.460 --> 2:24:49.780]  So the Google Chrome browser has an operating system called Adreno Chrome, so you're saying
[2:24:49.780 --> 2:24:51.860]  there might be some symbolism there?
[2:24:51.860 --> 2:24:52.860]  There's got to be.
[2:24:52.860 --> 2:24:53.860]  You're seeing it all over.
[2:24:53.860 --> 2:24:57.460]  That's a compulsion of satanic cult members.
[2:24:57.460 --> 2:25:01.940]  Whatever tenants, I don't have any idea because I serve absolutely 100% the other side.
[2:25:01.940 --> 2:25:03.940]  I serve Christ.
[2:25:03.940 --> 2:25:07.020]  I serve the Lord, and I will bow before no other.
[2:25:07.020 --> 2:25:13.700]  But this cult, this Luciferian cabal, they've got to compulsively demonstrate their allegiance
[2:25:13.700 --> 2:25:14.700]  to Satan.
[2:25:14.700 --> 2:25:17.220]  I think that's what that, you know, this is what this is all about.
[2:25:17.220 --> 2:25:19.420]  You see their symbolism everywhere.
[2:25:19.420 --> 2:25:20.420]  Okay.
[2:25:20.420 --> 2:25:21.420]  You cannot ignore it.
[2:25:21.420 --> 2:25:26.620]  Now, the Nuclear Threat Initiative, the document that prophesied, this organization that prophesied
[2:25:26.620 --> 2:25:30.420]  the outbreak of monkeypox, they said the outbreak would really reach fever pitch starting
[2:25:30.420 --> 2:25:35.860]  June 5th and then moving into June 6th, which happens to be the day we memorialized D-Day.
[2:25:35.860 --> 2:25:38.260]  It also happens to be 6666.
[2:25:38.260 --> 2:25:39.980]  Let's pull this up on the screen real quick.
[2:25:39.980 --> 2:25:44.900]  Congress, again, is working on legislation called HR666.
[2:25:44.900 --> 2:25:46.780]  It's called HR666.
[2:25:46.780 --> 2:25:49.620]  The Google Chrome logo is 6666.
[2:25:49.620 --> 2:25:50.620]  Next question.
[2:25:50.620 --> 2:25:53.740]  Why does the World Economic Forum's logo feature a 6666?
[2:25:53.740 --> 2:25:54.740]  Let's look it up, folks.
[2:25:54.740 --> 2:25:55.740]  World Economic Forum.
[2:25:55.740 --> 2:25:57.500]  Everybody type it into Google or DuckDuckGo.
[2:25:57.500 --> 2:26:00.300]  World Economic Forum logo, 6666.
[2:26:00.300 --> 2:26:01.300]  Look at the logo.
[2:26:01.300 --> 2:26:02.300]  Stare at it.
[2:26:02.300 --> 2:26:03.300]  Let it happen.
[2:26:03.300 --> 2:26:05.620]  It's like one of those, you know, those things back in the mall back in the day.
[2:26:05.620 --> 2:26:06.620]  You'd look at the painting.
[2:26:06.620 --> 2:26:07.620]  You'd look at the picture.
[2:26:07.620 --> 2:26:08.620]  You look at it long enough.
[2:26:08.620 --> 2:26:09.620]  You could eventually see something.
[2:26:09.620 --> 2:26:10.620]  Right.
[2:26:10.620 --> 2:26:11.620]  I'm going to pull this up for you so you could see it.
[2:26:11.620 --> 2:26:12.620]  Yeah, let me see.
[2:26:12.620 --> 2:26:16.100]  Why does the World Economic Forum have a logo with the 3666 right here?
[2:26:16.100 --> 2:26:17.100]  Oh, yeah.
[2:26:17.100 --> 2:26:18.100]  What's that all about?
[2:26:18.100 --> 2:26:19.580]  Yeah, it's all about that symbolism, Clay.
[2:26:19.580 --> 2:26:20.580]  Yeah.
[2:26:20.580 --> 2:26:26.260]  So, and why is the guru, the prophet of this whole, you know, this whole cabal talking
[2:26:26.260 --> 2:26:31.540]  about transhumanism, destroying God, you know, becoming, men becoming like gods.
[2:26:31.540 --> 2:26:35.940]  That's, that's a, if you can't see it, if you, if you don't realize we're in the midst
[2:26:35.940 --> 2:26:39.380]  of a spiritual warfare, that it's time to choose a side.
[2:26:39.380 --> 2:26:42.180]  It's a, it is the battle between good and evil.
[2:26:42.180 --> 2:26:45.540]  You're just, your, your head is in the sand and there's too many people that are like
[2:26:45.540 --> 2:26:50.260]  what I'm trying to do is give our listeners here on the Great Alex Jones show the opportunity
[2:26:50.260 --> 2:26:53.420]  to give themselves, you give tools to wake up their friends and family.
[2:26:53.420 --> 2:26:56.640]  My entire goal of today's show is how to wake up your friends and family, okay?
[2:26:56.640 --> 2:26:58.780]  We called the Great Reawakening versus the Great Reset.
[2:26:58.780 --> 2:27:02.140]  We know they're a Luciferian plan, but I'm trying to give you tools to wake up your family
[2:27:02.140 --> 2:27:03.140]  and friends.
[2:27:03.140 --> 2:27:04.660]  Next thing you can show your family and friends.
[2:27:04.660 --> 2:27:07.340]  Why does the CERN logo equal 666?
[2:27:07.340 --> 2:27:09.700]  The CERN logo is 666.
[2:27:09.700 --> 2:27:10.700]  Think about it for a second, folks.
[2:27:10.700 --> 2:27:14.540]  The world's largest supercomputer, you know, Elon Musk is teaming up to build the Hadron
[2:27:14.540 --> 2:27:16.940]  colliders for the world's largest supercomputer.
[2:27:16.940 --> 2:27:19.180]  Elon Musk's company called the Boring Company.
[2:27:19.180 --> 2:27:23.860]  They're making these, these Hadron colliders, you know, the Hadron collider located on the
[2:27:23.860 --> 2:27:29.300]  CERN supercomputer is located on top of the former location of where the Apollo temple
[2:27:29.300 --> 2:27:30.300]  was.
[2:27:30.300 --> 2:27:33.580]  You know, CERN, they had a grand opening celebrating one of the opening of one of their tunnels
[2:27:33.580 --> 2:27:35.100]  with a satanic ritual.
[2:27:35.100 --> 2:27:37.300]  Why is CERN's logo 666, Dr. Mehan?
[2:27:37.300 --> 2:27:38.300]  Yeah.
[2:27:38.300 --> 2:27:41.100]  Once again, it's the, it's the alignment of all the Luciferian cabal.
[2:27:41.100 --> 2:27:42.900]  They're all coming active at this time.
[2:27:42.900 --> 2:27:45.500]  This is an important time in history.
[2:27:45.500 --> 2:27:48.620]  Get on the side of God, pray God into this world.
[2:27:48.620 --> 2:27:53.020]  Let's bring an end to this Luciferian cabal and their rise to power.
[2:27:53.020 --> 2:27:54.620]  Now, Bill Gates has a patent.
[2:27:54.620 --> 2:27:59.460]  He's been working on or Microsoft has a patent for a cryptocurrency system using body activity
[2:27:59.460 --> 2:28:02.460]  with a patent number WO2020, 0606060.
[2:28:02.460 --> 2:28:11.060]  Do you see any parallel between that cryptocurrency and Revelation chapter 13, verses 16 through
[2:28:11.060 --> 2:28:12.060]  18?
[2:28:12.060 --> 2:28:13.060]  I mean, you know, these people know this.
[2:28:13.060 --> 2:28:18.140]  I mean, I get uncomfortable if the, if the, you know, the check charge is $6.66.
[2:28:18.140 --> 2:28:21.180]  I'll buy something else, you know, I'll get something else.
[2:28:21.180 --> 2:28:23.140]  I get so uncomfortable seeing that number.
[2:28:23.140 --> 2:28:27.980]  Why are, you know, our politicians, why are these corporations, you know, putting it
[2:28:27.980 --> 2:28:31.660]  out there upfront, right in your face to be seen?
[2:28:31.660 --> 2:28:37.500]  It's, it's, it's a, it's a dark signal that to whom they are allied.
[2:28:37.500 --> 2:28:38.500]  Let me just say this, folks.
[2:28:38.500 --> 2:28:42.180]  And if you want to know what you can do to help save this nation, one, go to time2freeamerica.com.

[2:30:56.180 --> 2:31:00.820]  I want to take a minute out to address the viewers and listeners of Info Wars and to
[2:31:00.820 --> 2:31:05.500]  remind you that we've been vindicated and that world government and its tyrannical
[2:31:05.500 --> 2:31:09.340]  aim of depopulation is now out of the open.
[2:31:09.340 --> 2:31:14.020]  Everything you and I have done together has been historic and we cannot continue in this
[2:31:14.020 --> 2:31:15.860]  fight without your support.
[2:31:15.860 --> 2:31:19.820]  I want to encourage you all to be part of this dream right now while you still can to

[2:31:41.860 --> 2:31:42.860]  year history.
[2:31:42.860 --> 2:31:46.020]  So I want to thank you all for your support and I want to encourage you all to be part
[2:31:46.020 --> 2:31:52.380]  of history and to get this historic memento that keeps us on air at infowarstore.com or

[2:31:56.540 --> 2:32:02.540]  Our world is so full of hype we are force fed dehumanizing propaganda by the corporate
[2:32:02.540 --> 2:32:05.540]  media, by the controlled churches and the universities.
[2:32:05.540 --> 2:32:08.140]  Why is this the case?
[2:32:08.140 --> 2:32:13.060]  Because we innately by God have been given the keys for our own minds, our own psyches,
[2:32:13.060 --> 2:32:19.820]  our own souls and by connecting to God we can empower ourselves and transcend the quote
[2:32:19.820 --> 2:32:25.260]  fallen or sinful state so the chemicals that we ingest and all the things we try to bring
[2:32:25.260 --> 2:32:31.300]  into our bodies to change who we are are only lowering us, they are only making us more
[2:32:31.300 --> 2:32:33.580]  depressed and in the end they are only making us less fulfilled.
[2:32:33.580 --> 2:32:38.740]  It is only by going within and really making that connection to God that we can truly empower
[2:32:38.740 --> 2:32:39.740]  ourselves.
[2:32:39.740 --> 2:32:44.420]  That's why the globalist, bombardist, toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal
[2:32:44.420 --> 2:32:49.740]  vitamins and minerals and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be able to
[2:32:49.740 --> 2:32:53.740]  basically reach out beyond the third dimension and that's where the incredible products come
[2:32:53.740 --> 2:32:57.740]  in at mforestore.com.
[2:32:57.740 --> 2:33:03.740]  Leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:03.740 --> 2:33:16.340]  And we're back filling in for the incredible Alex Jones.
[2:33:16.340 --> 2:33:17.340]  My name is Clay Clark.
[2:33:17.340 --> 2:33:21.940]  I'm the host of the reawakened America tour with General Flynn featuring Donald J. Trump
[2:33:21.940 --> 2:33:29.220]  Jr., Eric Trump, Dr. Tenpenny, Alex Jones, Owen Schreuer, Dr. Jim Meehan, Dr. Zelinko.
[2:33:29.220 --> 2:33:30.660]  It is an incredible cast of people.
[2:33:30.660 --> 2:33:36.060]  I encourage everybody, Dr. Judy Mikevitz, just go to time-to-freeamerica.com and you
[2:33:36.060 --> 2:33:40.180]  know how it is when you get down to the final 900 tickets or so because we're right now
[2:33:40.180 --> 2:33:43.580]  the reawakened America tour that we're taking to Virginia Beach.
[2:33:43.580 --> 2:33:45.300]  People keep calling saying are you still have it?
[2:33:45.300 --> 2:33:47.220]  You know what the monkeypox outbreak?
[2:33:47.220 --> 2:33:51.540]  We're now 30 days away from the reawakened America tour going to Virginia Beach and we're
[2:33:51.540 --> 2:33:55.500]  now down to our final 997 tickets and now somebody's requesting a ticket like every
[2:33:55.500 --> 2:33:56.500]  minute.
[2:33:56.500 --> 2:34:01.020]  The energy is unbelievable because what's happening is people know that this monkeypox
[2:34:01.020 --> 2:34:03.300]  pandemic is totally manufactured.
[2:34:03.300 --> 2:34:05.460]  They saw the COVID-19 epidemic.
[2:34:05.460 --> 2:34:06.660]  Some people were tricked.
[2:34:06.660 --> 2:34:07.660]  Some were deceived.
[2:34:07.660 --> 2:34:11.740]  But now people refuse to believe the deception but I encourage everybody right now, wake
[2:34:11.740 --> 2:34:15.940]  up your family and friends, go to time-to-freeamerica.com right now.
[2:34:15.940 --> 2:34:19.940]  Go there, click on the monkeypox button and you can download the document created by
[2:34:19.940 --> 2:34:21.340]  the Nuclear Threat Initiative.
[2:34:21.340 --> 2:34:24.940]  This organization heavily funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that actually
[2:34:24.940 --> 2:34:32.020]  prophesied the monkeypox outbreak beginning on May 15th of 2022 reaching full-scale outbreak
[2:34:32.020 --> 2:34:36.140]  on June 5th of 2022 funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[2:34:36.140 --> 2:34:38.300]  They prophesied it 15 months ago.
[2:34:38.300 --> 2:34:39.700]  They're not holding anything back.
[2:34:39.700 --> 2:34:44.980]  Also folks, let's go to time-to-freeamerica.com forward slash revelation for Knowledge Bomb
[2:34:44.980 --> 2:34:46.060]  number 11.
[2:34:46.060 --> 2:34:48.460]  Time-to-freeamerica.com forward slash revelation.
[2:34:48.460 --> 2:34:49.580]  Here we go.
[2:34:49.580 --> 2:34:54.460]  You know, Revelation 13-2, it's a controversial book called the Bible, Revelation's a book
[2:34:54.460 --> 2:34:55.460]  in the Bible there.
[2:34:55.460 --> 2:34:59.460]  Okay, and it says here, Revelation chapter 13 verse 2, it reads, And the beast which
[2:34:59.460 --> 2:35:03.980]  I saw was likened to a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth
[2:35:03.980 --> 2:35:07.900]  is the mouth of a lion, and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and his great
[2:35:07.900 --> 2:35:08.900]  authority.
[2:35:08.900 --> 2:35:11.780]  Revelation 13-2, this was written by the Apostle John.
[2:35:11.780 --> 2:35:13.900]  He was exiled on the island of Patmos.
[2:35:13.900 --> 2:35:16.660]  Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ gave him an open vision.
[2:35:16.660 --> 2:35:17.660]  He wrote this down.
[2:35:17.660 --> 2:35:24.660]  Dr. Meehan, that is the exact physical description of the Guardian of Nations statue presented
[2:35:24.660 --> 2:35:28.860]  to the United Nations and put right in front of the United Nations building in 405 East
[2:35:28.860 --> 2:35:30.980]  42nd Street, New York, New York.
[2:35:30.980 --> 2:35:31.980]  What are your thoughts?
[2:35:31.980 --> 2:35:38.220]  It can't get more overt than that, that they are right in your face, in the face of everybody
[2:35:38.220 --> 2:35:41.500]  that can see this thing, they are demonstrating their allegiance.
[2:35:41.500 --> 2:35:44.780]  You know, it's directly out of the Bible.
[2:35:44.780 --> 2:35:49.300]  They are manifesting the beast, they're using it as their symbolism, as more of their symbolism.
[2:35:49.300 --> 2:35:51.260]  You've got so much of this everywhere.
[2:35:51.260 --> 2:35:55.500]  It's the mark of Machiavellian sociopass, is the way I describe this, their ilk, is
[2:35:55.500 --> 2:36:00.420]  they are unafraid to be in your face with their Luciferian leanings.
[2:36:00.420 --> 2:36:02.820]  Yeah, look at it, see it, it's everywhere.
[2:36:02.820 --> 2:36:05.900]  Now, for anybody out there right now that if you're, if you're keeping score, we're
[2:36:05.900 --> 2:36:09.100]  on Knowledge Bomb number 12, okay, I'm gonna try to get through 25 in one hour, see if
[2:36:09.100 --> 2:36:10.100]  we can do it here.
[2:36:10.100 --> 2:36:13.860]  Okay, the CEO of Nokia was speaking at the World Economic Forum, and they asked him,
[2:36:13.860 --> 2:36:16.820]  sir, you're the head of Nokia, what's the future of smartphones?
[2:36:16.820 --> 2:36:22.740]  And he said this, this is Pekka Lundmark, the CEO of Nokia, listen to this, it's crazy.
[2:36:22.740 --> 2:36:27.220]  I want to ask when you all think we're gonna move from this form factor to something that's
[2:36:27.220 --> 2:36:30.620]  on your face glasses and when computing's all on the edge.
[2:36:30.620 --> 2:36:35.180]  All right, 50 seconds, who wants to answer it quickly?
[2:36:35.180 --> 2:36:39.100]  I think it will go, it will, first of all, it will definitely happen.
[2:36:39.100 --> 2:36:47.460]  I was talking about 6G earlier, which is around 2030, I would say that by then, definitely
[2:36:47.460 --> 2:37:06.540]  the smartphone as we know it.
[2:37:06.540 --> 2:37:12.100]  There are many preconceived notions about what defines Satanism.
[2:37:12.100 --> 2:37:16.460]  Some people will say that Satanists are just playing dress-up.
[2:37:16.460 --> 2:37:22.100]  Some say they sacrifice children, and others believe they have magical powers.
[2:37:22.100 --> 2:37:24.900]  But the truth is much more simple.
[2:37:24.900 --> 2:37:29.700]  Most people will agree that Satanism is the antithesis of Christianity.
[2:37:29.700 --> 2:37:33.260]  So first we must define what Christianity is.
[2:37:33.260 --> 2:37:39.380]  In a sentence, Christianity is the impulse to express brotherly love towards our fellow
[2:37:39.380 --> 2:37:41.540]  man.
[2:37:41.540 --> 2:37:44.420]  Satanism does not have that impulse at all.
[2:37:44.420 --> 2:37:50.380]  In the most simple terms, Satanism can be described with the pop culture phrase pimps
[2:37:50.380 --> 2:37:52.140]  and hoes.
[2:37:52.140 --> 2:37:55.060]  If these words upset you, good.
[2:37:55.060 --> 2:37:57.900]  We are talking about the nature of evil.
[2:37:57.900 --> 2:38:03.420]  And if it makes light of it, even better, these animals are nothing to fear.
[2:38:03.420 --> 2:38:08.460]  While the rich and powerful Satanists want you to believe they are witches and warlocks,
[2:38:08.460 --> 2:38:14.860]  they are nothing more than pimps and hoes, cannibals, feeding off other people like predatory
[2:38:14.860 --> 2:38:15.860]  animals.
[2:38:15.860 --> 2:38:23.100]  Completely devoid of the impulse for brotherly love, Satanism is base-level animal tribalism,
[2:38:23.100 --> 2:38:29.260]  an animal hierarchy comprised of the pimps at the top, the hoes they control, and the
[2:38:29.260 --> 2:38:32.540]  tricks they both exploit.
[2:38:32.540 --> 2:38:38.940]  This is the law of the jungle which has existed for millennia, a survival of the fittest
[2:38:38.940 --> 2:38:43.940]  dog-eat-dog world where the nice guys always finish last.
[2:38:43.940 --> 2:38:50.500]  It is the patriarchy that the anti-Christians claim to oppose, which makes no sense, because
[2:38:50.500 --> 2:38:57.060]  we are only able to transcend this ruthlessness with the Christian impulse of brotherly love.
[2:38:57.060 --> 2:38:58.460]  We're back here on the Alex Jones Show.
[2:38:58.460 --> 2:39:02.220]  My name is Clay Clark filling in for Alex Jones, whether we're under a deep state attack
[2:39:02.220 --> 2:39:04.140]  or whether the Internet is just failing, I don't know.
[2:39:04.140 --> 2:39:05.140]  Let's go back.
[2:39:05.140 --> 2:39:09.740]  So why did the CEO of Nokia say that smartphones will be in your body, Dr. Mehan?
[2:39:09.740 --> 2:39:15.780]  Well, because if they can put it in your body and they can sell it on the basis that it's
[2:39:15.780 --> 2:39:20.100]  going to be such a convenience to you and you can communicate and access the Internet
[2:39:20.100 --> 2:39:23.660]  and all the things that you love to do much more efficiently.
[2:39:23.660 --> 2:39:28.500]  The slippery slope here, ladies and gentlemen, is it's a two-way communication.
[2:39:28.500 --> 2:39:34.180]  What you can send out, they can send in, and in so doing, they can control the electrical,
[2:39:34.180 --> 2:39:35.620]  you know, we're electrical beings.
[2:39:35.620 --> 2:39:41.580]  We can be managed, we can be controlled, we can be inflamed, we can be damaged by that
[2:39:41.580 --> 2:39:42.580]  two-way communication.
[2:39:42.580 --> 2:39:48.060]  And this is why you've been telling your patients for years, look at what's in these vaccines,
[2:39:48.060 --> 2:39:50.020]  be very careful about these vaccines.
[2:39:50.020 --> 2:39:51.100]  Don't put them in your body.
[2:39:51.100 --> 2:39:55.660]  You're one of the first doctors in America to cry out to the world and let them know.
[2:39:55.660 --> 2:39:58.900]  Don't put RNA modifying nanotechnology inside your body.
[2:39:58.900 --> 2:40:02.180]  And I'm telling you, folks, if you get injured, you get sick.
[2:40:02.180 --> 2:40:05.220]  That's not when you want to be looking for a doctor because a lot of doctors right now
[2:40:05.220 --> 2:40:09.260]  are trying to get you to take a COVID-19 vaccine before they will see you.
[2:40:09.260 --> 2:40:10.420]  So I sincerely mean this.
[2:40:10.420 --> 2:40:11.940]  Put this into your phone right now.
[2:40:11.940 --> 2:40:14.500]  Put Dr. Mehan, put his website into your phone right now.
[2:40:14.500 --> 2:40:19.020]  It's mehan, M-E-E-H-A-N-M-D dot com, mehan, M-D dot com.
[2:40:19.020 --> 2:40:24.500]  His next audio clip, this comes to us from Alibaba, the head of Alibaba, J. Michael Evans.
[2:40:24.500 --> 2:40:27.340]  He says this is J. Michael Evans of Alibaba.
[2:40:27.340 --> 2:40:30.340]  Listen to what he said the future will be like at the world economic forum.
[2:40:30.340 --> 2:40:31.340]  He said this out loud.
[2:40:31.340 --> 2:40:37.580]  We're developing through technology an ability for consumers to measure their own carbon
[2:40:37.580 --> 2:40:38.580]  footprint.
[2:40:38.580 --> 2:40:40.620]  What does that mean?
[2:40:40.620 --> 2:40:42.900]  That's where are they traveling?
[2:40:42.900 --> 2:40:44.300]  How are they traveling?
[2:40:44.300 --> 2:40:45.300]  What are they eating?
[2:40:45.300 --> 2:40:47.860]  What are they consuming on the platform?
[2:40:47.860 --> 2:40:51.300]  So individual carbon footprint tracker.
[2:40:51.300 --> 2:40:52.300]  Unbelievable.
[2:40:52.300 --> 2:40:53.300]  They're saying this out loud.
[2:40:53.300 --> 2:40:57.300]  Now, this is why you have to support the program, the Info Wars program here in Alex
[2:40:57.300 --> 2:40:58.300]  Jones.
[2:40:58.300 --> 2:40:59.300]  I mean this.
[2:40:59.300 --> 2:41:01.940]  During the break, Alex has been putting out great content for years.
[2:41:01.940 --> 2:41:05.980]  You got to go to the shopping cart during the break and buy something, anything at all
[2:41:05.980 --> 2:41:09.380]  to support Alex and the entire team here because this is what's happening.
[2:41:09.380 --> 2:41:10.380]  Fox News, okay?
[2:41:10.380 --> 2:41:14.380]  They were just covering the world economic forum and a lot of people said, oh, wow, finally
[2:41:14.380 --> 2:41:21.060]  Fox is covering it, listen to what Jesse Waters said, may God have mercy on his soul.
[2:41:21.060 --> 2:41:25.620]  Listen to what Jesse Waters said out loud when addressing the discussion of Bill Gates.
[2:41:25.620 --> 2:41:26.620]  Listen to this.
[2:41:26.620 --> 2:41:30.900]  And I don't want to put down Bill Gates and these guys, you know, they do a lot for charities.
[2:41:30.900 --> 2:41:35.780]  And I don't want to put down Bill Gates and these guys, you know, they do a lot for charity.
[2:41:35.780 --> 2:41:40.300]  If I had to describe Bill Gates, this is Bill Gates who has Dr. Anthony Fauci on his board.
[2:41:40.300 --> 2:41:45.540]  This is Bill Gates, the one with the patent W02020 060606.
[2:41:45.540 --> 2:41:48.100]  If I had to describe Bill Gates, you know, the one that made the models that said that
[2:41:48.100 --> 2:41:50.260]  2.2 million Americans might die from COVID.
[2:41:50.260 --> 2:41:53.980]  If I had to describe Bill Gates, you know, the guy pushing the RNA modifying nanotechnology.
[2:41:53.980 --> 2:41:59.100]  If I had to describe Bill Gates, the guy putting vaccines into children and maiming and killing
[2:41:59.100 --> 2:42:05.220]  them and making them sterile and infertile, I would describe him as a pathological liar,
[2:42:05.220 --> 2:42:10.380]  a psychopath, a depopulationist, a eugenics, a neo-Nazi.
[2:42:10.380 --> 2:42:11.540]  He's the worst.
[2:42:11.540 --> 2:42:14.820]  And Jesse Waters, may God have mercy on your soul.
[2:42:14.820 --> 2:42:15.820]  Listen to this again.
[2:42:15.820 --> 2:42:17.140]  That's why you have to listen to InfoWars.
[2:42:17.140 --> 2:42:19.660]  I'm telling you, you can't let this program get off the air.
[2:42:19.660 --> 2:42:20.660]  Listen to this.
[2:42:20.660 --> 2:42:22.780]  And I don't want to put down Bill Gates and these guys.
[2:42:22.780 --> 2:42:24.340]  You don't want to put down Bill Gates?
[2:42:24.340 --> 2:42:25.340]  That would be like me.
[2:42:25.340 --> 2:42:28.340]  That would be like me saying, and I don't want to put down Adolf Hitler.
[2:42:28.340 --> 2:42:30.140]  You know, he was a good speaker.
[2:42:30.140 --> 2:42:31.140]  Listen to this psychopath.
[2:42:31.140 --> 2:42:33.620]  And I don't want to put down Bill Gates and these guys.
[2:42:33.620 --> 2:42:36.180]  This would be like introducing Mark.
[2:42:36.180 --> 2:42:40.420]  So this would be introducing Stalin and saying, I don't want to put down Joseph Stalin.
[2:42:40.420 --> 2:42:41.420]  Listen to this psychopath.
[2:42:41.420 --> 2:42:44.940]  And I don't want to put down Bill Gates and these guys.
[2:42:44.940 --> 2:42:46.820]  What are you talking about, Jesse Waters?
[2:42:46.820 --> 2:42:51.500]  How much money do you get paid to put RNA modifying nanotechnology inside people?
[2:42:51.500 --> 2:42:53.940]  Holy crap, buy something from Alex Jones during the break.
[2:42:53.940 --> 2:42:54.940]  We'll be back.
[2:42:54.940 --> 2:42:55.940]  Alex.
[2:42:55.940 --> 2:43:01.660]  A lot of listeners have told us it's hard to find out of the thousands of great items
[2:43:01.660 --> 2:43:04.300]  at m4store.com, all the storeable food.
[2:43:04.300 --> 2:43:08.260]  So we've made it easy with our great partners that supply us with the highest quality storeable

[2:43:18.780 --> 2:43:21.340]  is already unfolding with level food shortages.
[2:43:21.340 --> 2:43:25.620]  I told you over two years ago, the global is going to have massive inflation and food
[2:43:25.620 --> 2:43:28.780]  shortages and it's happened just like clockwork.
[2:43:28.780 --> 2:43:31.180]  And I'm telling you, it's going to get a lot worse.
[2:43:31.180 --> 2:43:32.180]  They have designed this.
[2:43:32.180 --> 2:43:38.060]  The way to beat them is to buy food now before your dollar is even more devalued.

[2:44:06.420 --> 2:44:09.020]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[2:44:09.020 --> 2:44:10.540]  They know you're angry.
[2:44:10.540 --> 2:44:14.860]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[2:44:14.860 --> 2:44:15.860]  we've got.

[2:44:57.860 --> 2:45:01.780]  What we all thought was going to happen in the 90s when the internet and mobile technology
[2:45:01.780 --> 2:45:05.380]  first came out, which is we thought, you know, this is going to level the playing field.
[2:45:05.380 --> 2:45:07.740]  Everybody's going to have access to the same information and everybody's going to be able
[2:45:07.740 --> 2:45:10.540]  to freely communicate that information.
[2:45:10.540 --> 2:45:16.500]  That's our goal, to get back to that place where we all have access to all of the information.
[2:45:16.500 --> 2:45:21.540]  We all have the ability to freely communicate that information with whomever we want, whenever
[2:45:21.540 --> 2:45:26.420]  we want and we don't have to worry about anybody tracking what we're doing and trying
[2:45:26.420 --> 2:45:33.660]  to judge us or categorize us or figure out some way to go after us because of the conversations
[2:45:33.660 --> 2:45:38.660]  we're having, because of the internet searches that we're doing, because of the discussions,
[2:45:38.660 --> 2:45:41.140]  the people we want to talk to about these things.
[2:45:41.140 --> 2:45:45.340]  So that's our goal, is to help people take back their freedom by helping them to take
[2:45:45.340 --> 2:45:46.660]  back their privacy.
[2:45:46.660 --> 2:45:51.300]  And so that's really what we're trying to do and so I hope that everybody listening
[2:45:51.300 --> 2:45:56.860]  will check us out at boltowireless.com, that's v-o-l-t-a-wireless.com.
[2:45:56.860 --> 2:46:01.140]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or a pump gas or whether you're a farmer or
[2:46:01.140 --> 2:46:05.980]  rancher, a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire, Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these
[2:46:05.980 --> 2:46:06.980]  profiles.
[2:46:06.980 --> 2:46:07.980]  You see it every year.
[2:46:07.980 --> 2:46:12.780]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers
[2:46:12.780 --> 2:46:18.500]  and almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups
[2:46:18.500 --> 2:46:22.100]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding
[2:46:22.100 --> 2:46:23.100]  this and knowing this.
[2:46:23.100 --> 2:46:28.740]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[2:46:28.740 --> 2:46:34.020]  to be able to do things tax wise that's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of
[2:46:34.020 --> 2:46:35.020]  your money.
[2:46:35.020 --> 2:46:39.740]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[2:46:39.740 --> 2:46:46.860]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com, one word, jonestaxrelief.com
[2:46:46.860 --> 2:46:57.420]  or call 833-904-285-833-904-285.
[2:46:57.420 --> 2:47:13.900]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:13.900 --> 2:47:31.460]  Thanks to
[2:47:31.460 --> 2:47:35.340]  It is an organization heavily funded by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.
[2:47:35.340 --> 2:47:40.260]  It was founded by Ted Turner and this organization said 15 months ago that they, that they guessed
[2:47:40.260 --> 2:47:45.300]  or prophesied or planned that there would be a monkeypox outbreak beginning in May,
[2:47:45.300 --> 2:47:52.340]  on May 15th of 2022, crescendoing into a full outbreak starting June 5th into June 6th,
[2:47:52.340 --> 2:47:57.300]  the celebration of the memorialization of D-Day, which happens also to be 666.
[2:47:57.300 --> 2:47:58.300]  Okay.
[2:47:58.300 --> 2:48:02.620]  So they bake out, they bake their plan into movies and films.
[2:48:02.620 --> 2:48:06.940]  So the X-Files, they put out a broadcast and I want everyone to look this up right
[2:48:06.940 --> 2:48:07.940]  now.
[2:48:07.940 --> 2:48:11.620]  So let's go to rumble.com if we can, rumble.com and search for the Thrive Time Show.
[2:48:11.620 --> 2:48:13.020]  That's where you can find our shows.
[2:48:13.020 --> 2:48:14.940]  You go to rumble.com and search for the Thrive Time Show.
[2:48:14.940 --> 2:48:19.900]  I just put this out and it's called The Great Reset X-Files Season 10.
[2:48:19.900 --> 2:48:21.220]  Listen to the audio excerpt here.
[2:48:21.220 --> 2:48:22.620]  It is absolutely mind boggling.
[2:48:22.620 --> 2:48:27.500]  This is the excerpt from the X-Files Season 10, 2016.
[2:48:27.500 --> 2:48:28.500]  Listen to what they said.
[2:48:28.500 --> 2:48:29.500]  Listen to this.
[2:48:29.500 --> 2:48:30.500]  Here we go.
[2:48:30.500 --> 2:48:31.500]  Tatl Malley has been making claims.
[2:48:31.500 --> 2:48:32.500]  Claims about what?
[2:48:32.500 --> 2:48:38.700]  You and everyone you know has a piece of DNA in your genome put there without your knowing
[2:48:38.700 --> 2:48:39.700]  it.
[2:48:39.700 --> 2:48:40.700]  By whom?
[2:48:40.700 --> 2:48:41.700]  That's the question of the day.
[2:48:41.700 --> 2:48:43.500]  This is an internet lunatic.
[2:48:43.500 --> 2:48:45.100]  You're not saying you believe him.
[2:48:45.100 --> 2:48:46.100]  Hold on, Agent Einstein.
[2:48:46.100 --> 2:48:48.100]  You're talking to a scientist.
[2:48:48.100 --> 2:48:49.100]  Forgive me, Assistant Director.
[2:48:49.100 --> 2:48:52.820]  It may sound insensitive, but the suggestion is pure science fiction.
[2:48:52.820 --> 2:48:56.900]  What I'm saying, Agent Einstein, is that the facts, as I understand them, cannot be
[2:48:56.900 --> 2:48:59.820]  discounted out of hand.
[2:48:59.820 --> 2:49:08.500]  No one has the right or the ability to tamper with your DNA unless we gave them that ability.
[2:49:08.500 --> 2:49:09.500]  Here's Robert Malone.
[2:49:09.500 --> 2:49:10.900]  This is Robert Malone on Glenn Beck.
[2:49:10.900 --> 2:49:11.900]  Listen to what he says.
[2:49:11.900 --> 2:49:12.900]  Listen.
[2:49:12.900 --> 2:49:18.100]  A joint report from the government of the UK and Germany about transhumanism.
[2:49:18.100 --> 2:49:21.980]  And as you know, this is one of the agendas of the World Economic Forum that's not hidden.
[2:49:21.980 --> 2:49:26.700]  It's not a conspiracy transhumanism, and they talk about the RNA vaccines as an
[2:49:26.700 --> 2:49:33.140]  entry point, which is kind of opening that space ethically and otherwise.
[2:49:33.140 --> 2:49:39.980]  So that's part of the push for these particular products is it relates to that transhumanism
[2:49:39.980 --> 2:49:40.980]  agenda.
[2:49:40.980 --> 2:49:41.980]  That's right.
[2:49:41.980 --> 2:49:45.940]  When you say they're tampering with our DNA that they're able to shut down our immune
[2:49:45.940 --> 2:49:49.060]  systems by the addition of something to our DNA.
[2:49:49.060 --> 2:49:51.060]  Yes, but I don't know how exactly.
[2:49:51.060 --> 2:49:52.780]  How it's being triggered.
[2:49:52.780 --> 2:49:54.260]  I don't know that either.
[2:49:54.260 --> 2:49:56.820]  But why it's happening now?
[2:49:56.820 --> 2:49:58.980]  What can we possibly do?
[2:49:58.980 --> 2:50:00.700]  We need to act quickly.
[2:50:00.700 --> 2:50:01.700]  You were right about that.
[2:50:01.700 --> 2:50:03.700]  Well, I was wrong about the science.
[2:50:03.700 --> 2:50:06.700]  I was wrong about what's causing it, dead wrong in fact.
[2:50:06.700 --> 2:50:10.620]  But it's clearly a widespread failure of our immune systems.
[2:50:10.620 --> 2:50:11.860]  Through gene tampering.
[2:50:11.860 --> 2:50:15.420]  A virus within a virus that was put there through the smallpox vaccine.
[2:50:15.420 --> 2:50:17.500]  It's what these men are calling the Spartan virus.
[2:50:17.500 --> 2:50:20.100]  We have to figure this out.
[2:50:20.100 --> 2:50:21.100]  Interesting.
[2:50:21.100 --> 2:50:26.820]  Time to freeamerica.com forward slash revelation time to freeamerica.com forward slash revelation.
[2:50:26.820 --> 2:50:27.820]  Did you know this, folks?
[2:50:27.820 --> 2:50:28.820]  Did you know this?
[2:50:28.820 --> 2:50:34.820]  There's a technology out there called CRISPR and someone says, what is that CRISPR C-R-I-S-P-R
[2:50:34.820 --> 2:50:35.820]  CRISPR.
[2:50:35.820 --> 2:50:42.580]  And on December 9th of 2019, the technology was created to use the mRNA technology created
[2:50:42.580 --> 2:50:47.740]  by Dr. Malone to put CRISPR gene editing technology inside your body, thus making it
[2:50:47.740 --> 2:50:52.380]  possible to deliver a lipid nanoparticle, lipid meaning fat cell nanoparticle computer
[2:50:52.380 --> 2:50:55.340]  inside your body that could deliver a pathogen.
[2:50:55.340 --> 2:50:59.900]  So if you have a shot inside your body, you could then have your body, your immune system
[2:50:59.900 --> 2:51:01.220]  be turned off or turned on.
[2:51:01.220 --> 2:51:02.780]  Your body can release a pathogen.
[2:51:02.780 --> 2:51:03.780]  This was all prophesied.
[2:51:03.780 --> 2:51:07.220]  And I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, we are living through the implementation
[2:51:07.220 --> 2:51:09.100]  of what's called the Great Reset.
[2:51:09.100 --> 2:51:11.220]  For further proof, go to YouTube real quick, folks.
[2:51:11.220 --> 2:51:15.020]  Go to YouTube and search for dark seed grimes.
[2:51:15.020 --> 2:51:16.020]  Dark seed grimes.
[2:51:16.020 --> 2:51:17.020]  Okay.
[2:51:17.020 --> 2:51:21.860]  D-A-R-K-S-E-I-D and then grimes on YouTube right now.
[2:51:21.860 --> 2:51:22.860]  Okay.
[2:51:22.860 --> 2:51:27.660]  So right before the pandemic began, right before the pandemic began, grimes released a song
[2:51:27.660 --> 2:51:29.660]  called Dark Seed.
[2:51:29.660 --> 2:51:34.980]  Now in 1971, Jack Kirby created a character called Dark Seed that runs around the world
[2:51:34.980 --> 2:51:38.860]  putting RNA modifying nanotechnology inside people to eliminate free will.
[2:51:38.860 --> 2:51:39.860]  What?
[2:51:39.860 --> 2:51:43.980]  Jack Kirby created a character in 1971 called Dark Seed that runs around putting RNA modifying
[2:51:43.980 --> 2:51:47.580]  nanotechnology inside humans to control their free will.
[2:51:47.580 --> 2:51:51.940]  And the character's called Dark Seed, and he introduces a thing called the Fourth Kingdom.
[2:51:51.940 --> 2:51:55.700]  And in the book of Daniel, Chapter 7, there's this thing called the Fourth Kingdom.
[2:51:55.700 --> 2:51:58.580]  And then Klaus Schwab talks about the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
[2:51:58.580 --> 2:51:59.580]  So think about it again.
[2:51:59.580 --> 2:52:02.580]  In 1971, Rules for Radicals was written.
[2:52:02.580 --> 2:52:03.580]  What?
[2:52:03.580 --> 2:52:06.940]  In 1971, Disney's Epcot Center was created.
[2:52:06.940 --> 2:52:07.940]  What?
[2:52:07.940 --> 2:52:10.940]  In 1971, the world got off the World Economic, what?
[2:52:10.940 --> 2:52:16.220]  In 1971, America got off the gold standard per the recommendation of who?
[2:52:16.220 --> 2:52:17.220]  Henry Kissinger.
[2:52:17.220 --> 2:52:20.860]  So in 1971, America got off the gold standard per the recommendation of Henry Kissinger.
[2:52:20.860 --> 2:52:23.980]  In 1971, the World Economic Forum was founded.
[2:52:23.980 --> 2:52:26.500]  In 1971, Rules for Radicals was written.
[2:52:26.500 --> 2:52:29.220]  In 1971, the Disney Epcot Center was created.
[2:52:29.220 --> 2:52:32.020]  In 1971, the Dark Seed comic character was created.
[2:52:32.020 --> 2:52:35.780]  And in 1971, America began sacrificing babies to bail.
[2:52:35.780 --> 2:52:37.340]  It's a 50-year plan.
[2:52:37.340 --> 2:52:43.660]  They started it in 1971 into 72, and it's all designed to be implemented right now.
[2:52:43.660 --> 2:52:47.300]  We are living through the spiritual battle that was prophesied in the Bible.
[2:52:47.300 --> 2:52:48.460]  We are living through it right now.
[2:52:48.460 --> 2:52:52.460]  And if you don't believe me, there's a great prophet by the name of Robin Bullock, one
[2:52:52.460 --> 2:52:56.940]  of the few pastors I know willing to call out Yuval Noah Harahi.
[2:52:56.940 --> 2:53:00.460]  So listen to the song by Grimes called Dark Seed.
[2:53:00.460 --> 2:53:02.100]  It's written in Chinese.
[2:53:02.100 --> 2:53:04.660]  It features an artist by the name of Pan.
[2:53:04.660 --> 2:53:08.180]  It's called Dark Seed and it was released right before the pandemic.
[2:53:08.180 --> 2:53:09.180]  What?
[2:53:09.180 --> 2:53:10.180]  Next question.
[2:53:10.180 --> 2:53:13.260]  Why does Yuval Noah Harahi insist on calling humans hackable animals?
[2:53:13.260 --> 2:53:16.780]  Dr. Mehan, he refers, let me play this audio clip here.
[2:53:16.780 --> 2:53:21.300]  Yuval Noah Harahi insists on calling humans hackable animals.
[2:53:21.300 --> 2:53:22.300]  Here we go.
[2:53:22.300 --> 2:53:25.540]  Humans are now hackable animals.
[2:53:25.540 --> 2:53:31.340]  You know, the whole idea that humans have, you know, they have this soul or spirit and
[2:53:31.340 --> 2:53:35.260]  they have free will and nobody knows what's happening inside me.
[2:53:35.260 --> 2:53:40.100]  So whatever I choose, whether in the election or whether in the supermarket, this is my
[2:53:40.100 --> 2:53:41.100]  free will.
[2:53:41.100 --> 2:53:42.100]  That's over.
[2:53:42.100 --> 2:53:43.100]  So I want to just tee this up.
[2:53:43.100 --> 2:53:44.100]  Okay.
[2:53:44.100 --> 2:53:45.100]  So think about this for a second.
[2:53:45.100 --> 2:53:46.100]  Okay.
[2:53:46.100 --> 2:53:47.100]  The monkeypox outbreak is being pushed right now.
[2:53:47.100 --> 2:53:50.700]  And they're saying that the only way to stop it, the World Health Organization, Dr. Michael
[2:53:50.700 --> 2:53:54.460]  J. Ryan says the only way to stop it is for all countries to comply and any country that
[2:53:54.460 --> 2:53:58.180]  won't comply, no matter where in the world you are, the World Health Organization has
[2:53:58.180 --> 2:54:03.740]  the authority to deploy assets onto foreign soil into sovereign, into sovereign nations
[2:54:03.740 --> 2:54:05.100]  to stop the outbreak.
[2:54:05.100 --> 2:54:11.380]  And they want to put a monkeypox vaccine inside your body that has the mRNA technology
[2:54:11.380 --> 2:54:12.380]  in it.
[2:54:12.380 --> 2:54:13.580]  That integrates into your genome.
[2:54:13.580 --> 2:54:19.060]  I mean, it's been published in multiple medical journal now, confirmed that that the mRNA
[2:54:19.060 --> 2:54:25.060]  vaccines are transcribing and inserting DNA sequences into the liver cells.
[2:54:25.060 --> 2:54:29.860]  So what you saw in the X-Files, that predictive programming, it's occurring right now.
[2:54:29.860 --> 2:54:33.300]  So what I want people to do right now is I'm going to give you guys three free tools
[2:54:33.300 --> 2:54:34.300]  right now.
[2:54:34.300 --> 2:54:37.340]  If you're listening and you want to be able to explain this to your friends and family,
[2:54:37.340 --> 2:54:41.540]  go to time2freeamerica.com forward slash revelation.
[2:54:41.540 --> 2:54:43.980]  That's the entire timeline of what we talked about.
[2:54:43.980 --> 2:54:46.780]  Time2freeamerica.com forward slash revelation.
[2:54:46.780 --> 2:54:50.460]  All the patents that prove the plan, you can see that the system and method for testing
[2:54:50.460 --> 2:54:56.260]  for COVID-19 was patented in 2015, the system and method for testing for COVID-19 was patented
[2:54:56.260 --> 2:54:57.260]  in 2015.
[2:54:57.260 --> 2:55:00.740]  You can see the patents for the RNA modifying nanotechnology that goes inside the human body.
[2:55:00.740 --> 2:55:03.220]  You can see the patents for the CRISPR gene editing technology.
[2:55:03.220 --> 2:55:06.100]  It's all there at time2freeamerica.com forward slash revelation.
[2:55:06.100 --> 2:55:10.580]  Two, if you go to time2freeamerica.com, you can download my newest book, absolutely for
[2:55:10.580 --> 2:55:11.580]  free.
[2:55:11.580 --> 2:55:13.700]  It's called The Great Reawakening versus The Great Reset.
[2:55:13.700 --> 2:55:16.460]  It's right on the homepage at time2freeamerica.com.
[2:55:16.460 --> 2:55:18.980]  If you want to buy the book, you can go to the bookstore and do it, but you can download
[2:55:18.980 --> 2:55:19.980]  the book for free.
[2:55:19.980 --> 2:55:25.100]  You can watch the Reawakened America Tour documentary, absolutely for free, by going
[2:55:25.100 --> 2:55:27.980]  to the shopping cart at time2freeamerica.com.
[2:55:27.980 --> 2:55:28.980]  Here's what's happening.
[2:55:28.980 --> 2:55:31.100]  We have just under 1,000 tickets remaining.
[2:55:31.100 --> 2:55:35.540]  We have 997 tickets remaining before I hopped on the show today for the Reawakened America
[2:55:35.540 --> 2:55:38.300]  Tour in July 8th and 9th in Virginia Beach.
[2:55:38.300 --> 2:55:42.060]  I'm telling you this not because I'm prophetic, but because I've read their plan.
[2:55:42.060 --> 2:55:47.420]  They are going to try to impose a lockdown of some sorts between now and July 4th.
[2:55:47.420 --> 2:55:51.860]  What I need you to do is I need you to show that the American spirit is not dead and that
[2:55:51.860 --> 2:55:54.420]  you believe that Jesus is king and that we're going to win this thing.
[2:55:54.420 --> 2:55:56.940]  We're not going to submit to the World Health Organization.
[2:55:56.940 --> 2:56:01.780]  God has given us authority and dominion over these devils, so we've got to show up in mass.
[2:56:01.780 --> 2:56:06.660]  We're 997 tickets away from selling out, but I need you to actually show up.
[2:56:06.660 --> 2:56:11.740]  We've got Dr. Zalinko, we have General Flynn will be there, Donald J. Trump Jr., Eric Trump
[2:56:11.740 --> 2:56:16.180]  will be there, Jim Brewer, Mike Lindell, Dr. Jim Mehan will be there, Lance Wallenow,
[2:56:16.180 --> 2:56:21.820]  the prophet Roger Stone, Simone Gold, Sean Foyd, Dr. Dave Martin, Mel Kay, Dr. Judy
[2:56:21.820 --> 2:56:22.820]  Mykovitz.
[2:56:22.820 --> 2:56:26.380]  I mean, they're all going to be there, but I need you to show up because if you comply
[2:56:26.380 --> 2:56:29.300]  to the lockdowns, America will die.
[2:56:29.300 --> 2:56:34.020]  So if you're going to request those tickets, go to time2freeamerica.com, time2freeamerica.com,
[2:56:34.020 --> 2:56:37.260]  and when our team calls you, we have to verify that you're not Antifa.
[2:56:37.260 --> 2:56:38.580]  You can name your price.
[2:56:38.580 --> 2:56:42.020]  It's going to cost me several hundred thousand dollars to put on this event, and every event
[2:56:42.020 --> 2:56:45.860]  we've ever done, I don't take an income from this, I don't take a salary, but I need you
[2:56:45.860 --> 2:56:46.860]  to name your price.
[2:56:46.860 --> 2:56:48.300]  You can pay whatever you want there.
[2:56:48.300 --> 2:56:52.180]  If you use promo code INFOWARDS, we'll give you free access to the Meet and Greet where
[2:56:52.180 --> 2:56:56.540]  you can meet thousands of listeners to the INFOWARDS program, and then if you can, folks,
[2:56:56.540 --> 2:57:02.860]  go to infowars.com and buy something, buy anything from Alex Jones, buy something, support
[2:57:02.860 --> 2:57:03.860]  this great program.
[2:57:03.860 --> 2:57:07.860]  He's been doing a great work for a long time, and I also encourage you go to MehanMD because
[2:57:07.860 --> 2:57:11.940]  Dr. Mehan, most doctors are forcing the COVID-19 shots on their patients.
[2:57:11.940 --> 2:57:14.380]  Are you forcing the COVID-19 shots on your patients?
[2:57:14.380 --> 2:57:19.900]  I'm forcing my patients to read for themselves, to do their own research, and understand that
[2:57:19.900 --> 2:57:23.260]  the COVID vaccines, we have no long-term studies on.
[2:57:23.260 --> 2:57:27.620]  We have short-term studies that are showing horrific damage to vaccine recipients.
[2:57:27.620 --> 2:57:32.740]  So I encourage you go to mehanmd.com, save that website in your phone, mehanmd.com, get
[2:57:32.740 --> 2:57:34.220]  your tickets to the Reawake in America tour.
[2:57:34.220 --> 2:57:40.180]  We're also going to New York, Rochester, New York in August to get your tickets at time2freeamerica.com.
[2:57:40.180 --> 2:57:43.540]  My name is Clay Clark, filling in for the great Alex Jones, thank you for listening,
[2:57:43.540 --> 2:57:47.260]  and buy something at infowarstore.com.
[2:57:47.260 --> 2:57:52.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, high-quality, storeable food is back in stock, ready to ship right
[2:57:52.420 --> 2:57:53.420]  now.
[2:57:53.420 --> 2:57:57.100]  We've not been selling food for three months because it was taking several weeks for the
[2:57:57.100 --> 2:57:59.300]  food to get packaged and delivered to you.
[2:57:59.300 --> 2:58:03.940]  Most of their companies are completely out, but now they have a large spectrum of high-quality
[2:58:03.940 --> 2:58:05.860]  food ready to ship.
[2:58:05.860 --> 2:58:10.900]  Everything you find at preparewithalex.com or preparetoday.com is in stock, ready to
[2:58:10.900 --> 2:58:11.900]  ship.
[2:58:11.900 --> 2:58:16.580]  Preparewithalex.com or preparetoday.com and order your high-quality, storeable food right
[2:58:16.580 --> 2:58:18.380]  now, ready to ship to you and your family.
[2:58:18.380 --> 2:58:22.300]  With the inflation happening, with the food shortages, with the wars, with the collapse
[2:58:22.300 --> 2:58:25.900]  in wars, everything's happening, is one of the most important things you can make is
[2:58:25.900 --> 2:58:29.740]  to have high-quality, storeable food, water filtration, air filtration, and more, and it's
[2:58:29.740 --> 2:58:33.740]  not just those items, it's hundreds of other high-quality, preparedness items and survival
[2:58:33.740 --> 2:58:40.380]  items right now at preparewithalex.com that again redirects to preparetoday.com.
[2:58:40.380 --> 2:58:42.100]  I would not procrastinate, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:58:42.100 --> 2:58:45.660]  One of the most important things you can do is get ahead of inflation now because the inflation
[2:58:45.660 --> 2:58:46.660]  is just beginning.
[2:58:46.660 --> 2:58:51.220]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or a pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a
[2:58:51.220 --> 2:58:53.540]  rancher, a doctor, a lawyer, or a millionaire.
[2:58:53.540 --> 2:58:56.780]  Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[2:58:56.780 --> 2:58:57.780]  You see it every year.
[2:58:57.780 --> 2:59:00.140]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers.
[2:59:00.140 --> 2:59:02.980]  50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[2:59:02.980 --> 2:59:07.820]  And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax
[2:59:07.820 --> 2:59:12.180]  groups, because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding
[2:59:12.180 --> 2:59:13.180]  this and knowing this.
[2:59:13.180 --> 2:59:18.860]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody.
[2:59:18.860 --> 2:59:24.060]  To be able to do things tax-wise, it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of
[2:59:24.060 --> 2:59:25.060]  your money.
[2:59:25.060 --> 2:59:29.780]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[2:59:29.780 --> 2:59:36.940]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com, one word, jonestaxrelief.com,
[2:59:36.940 --> 2:59:43.940]  or call 833-904-285-833-904-285.
[3:00:06.940 --> 3:00:36.240]  We've got a ton of news to cover over the course of the next hour, including the massive
[3:00:36.240 --> 3:00:41.660]  scandal out of the Europe tree, which basically, as I always say, should be one of the top
[3:00:41.660 --> 3:00:43.680]  news stories in the world.
[3:00:43.680 --> 3:00:52.060]  We have the rich and famous of Spain being caught in a massive scam, full-on police investigation,
[3:00:52.060 --> 3:01:00.140]  wealthy elitist sports people, TV personalities, right across the board, buying, paying illegally
[3:01:00.140 --> 3:01:06.400]  for fake COVID vaccine certificates so they don't have to take the vaccine.
[3:01:06.400 --> 3:01:12.180]  This included top medical personnel and the head of a major pharmaceutical company involved
[3:01:12.180 --> 3:01:14.700]  in researching COVID drugs.
[3:01:14.700 --> 3:01:19.860]  So the very same people behind pushing the COVID vaccine don't want to take it themselves.
[3:01:19.860 --> 3:01:21.380]  Gee, I wonder why?
[3:01:21.380 --> 3:01:25.300]  Could it have anything to do with the fact that Australians under 40 have been urged
[3:01:25.300 --> 3:01:30.820]  to get heart checks due to sudden adult death syndrome, a new sudden death syndrome that
[3:01:30.820 --> 3:01:35.820]  involves young people that has just miraculously sprung up over the past six months?
[3:01:35.820 --> 3:01:41.700]  We have 5,000 non-COVID excess deaths in the last five weeks in the UK.
[3:01:41.700 --> 3:01:43.340]  What could possibly be causing that?
[3:01:43.340 --> 3:01:44.340]  Gee, I wonder.
[3:01:44.340 --> 3:01:50.500]  We have Joe Biden on Jimmy Kimmel engaging in some bizarre rant about there not being
[3:01:50.500 --> 3:01:56.780]  enough biracial couples on TV, they're everywhere, which ties into a poll out of the UK, which
[3:01:56.780 --> 3:02:02.060]  I'm also going to get into, which shows that the general public thinks that transgenders,
[3:02:02.060 --> 3:02:10.140]  gays, Muslims, black people are vastly overrepresented compared to their actual demographic figure
[3:02:10.140 --> 3:02:11.140]  in the country.
[3:02:11.140 --> 3:02:12.140]  Why is that?
[3:02:12.140 --> 3:02:15.180]  Well, we're going to tell you over the course of the next hour.
[3:02:15.180 --> 3:02:20.260]  We also got the continuing monkeypox outbreak, which a couple of weeks ago, the World Health
[3:02:20.260 --> 3:02:25.300]  Organization came out and said we should really reconsider having summer festivals and mass
[3:02:25.300 --> 3:02:30.900]  gatherings apart from LGBT Pride Month gatherings, though they're perfectly acceptable because
[3:02:30.900 --> 3:02:36.580]  just like the BLM rallies back in June 2020, apparently the virus just passes them right
[3:02:36.580 --> 3:02:37.580]  on by.
[3:02:37.580 --> 3:02:42.860]  Meanwhile, the first monkeypox patient to go public says that he caught the virus after
[3:02:42.860 --> 3:02:45.300]  having gay sex with 10 men.
[3:02:45.300 --> 3:02:49.860]  What a fantastic lifestyle that we should definitely promote to young kids.
[3:02:49.860 --> 3:02:54.740]  Asian feminists face as three years in prison for saying biological men can't be lesbians.
[3:02:54.740 --> 3:03:00.180]  Again, Gay Pride Month, marginalized community, oppressed community, really?
[3:03:00.180 --> 3:03:05.220]  When your critics are literally being arrested and thrown in prison, the questioning you,
[3:03:05.220 --> 3:03:06.460]  not that marginalized.
[3:03:06.460 --> 3:03:11.100]  We have a UK police force being mocked over a gay pride tweet, where they literally said
[3:03:11.100 --> 3:03:14.660]  in the same tweet, they're going to monitor the responses for hate crimes.
[3:03:14.660 --> 3:03:20.380]  We have a Pride in the Park event in Idaho, targeted at children, which includes drag queens
[3:03:20.380 --> 3:03:24.460]  and Satanists who promise to unbaptize your children.
[3:03:24.460 --> 3:03:25.900]  Hands are with the baddies.
[3:03:25.900 --> 3:03:30.860]  Girl in car attack happened yesterday, they're blaming it on mental illness, that's been
[3:03:30.860 --> 3:03:34.820]  swept under the rug very quickly indeed.
[3:03:34.820 --> 3:03:40.380]  Then we have the continuing fallout from the massive riots that took place before the Champions
[3:03:40.380 --> 3:03:44.180]  League final in Paris a couple of weeks ago.
[3:03:44.180 --> 3:03:49.940]  New polls on that, a new warning by Spain's conservative box party that similar scenes
[3:03:49.940 --> 3:03:56.340]  of bedlam could spread to other areas of Europe thanks to mass migration and a complete lack
[3:03:56.340 --> 3:03:59.980]  of adequate integration of those migrants.
[3:03:59.980 --> 3:04:05.500]  We also have a poll out of the US where Trump voters believe they're being replaced by huge
[3:04:05.500 --> 3:04:12.420]  voting blocks of illegal migrants, 73% of them not quite a minority fringe belief now,
[3:04:12.420 --> 3:04:13.420]  is it?
[3:04:13.420 --> 3:04:19.260]  Meanwhile, with the war between Ukraine and Russia, Ukraine has decided that it's definitely
[3:04:19.260 --> 3:04:24.420]  going to vanquish Putin's war machine by banning the classic historical novel War
[3:04:24.420 --> 3:04:27.140]  and Peace from being taught in schools.
[3:04:27.140 --> 3:04:33.940]  There's also a top Ukrainian official who was actually fired as a result of the Ukrainian
[3:04:33.940 --> 3:04:40.420]  parliament voting against her, relying about Russians committing mass rape and in this
[3:04:40.420 --> 3:04:45.700]  new development she admits that it was to convince countries to send more weapons to
[3:04:45.700 --> 3:04:46.700]  Ukraine.
[3:04:46.700 --> 3:05:13.700]  It's going to get into all of that and more on the other side, Summit.News will be back
[3:05:13.700 --> 3:05:20.700]  with more of this.

[3:06:07.900 --> 3:06:20.740]  Live it is for Summit.News, our as I mentioned in the previous segment, absolutely huge mammoth
[3:06:20.740 --> 3:06:25.980]  monumental story out of Spain, which has actually been circulating for the past week or so
[3:06:25.980 --> 3:06:32.660]  has got absolutely zero attention in the legacy media in the West and for good reason.
[3:06:32.660 --> 3:06:38.020]  We have the headline rich people in Spain, including pharmaceutical company president,
[3:06:38.020 --> 3:06:41.580]  caught buying fake COVID vaccine certificates.
[3:06:41.580 --> 3:06:44.900]  Of course, this is an issue that we've been covering for the past two years.
[3:06:44.900 --> 3:06:51.060]  I know people personally, not mentioning any names, quite wealthy people, quite prominent
[3:06:51.060 --> 3:06:57.820]  people who told me outright how easy it was to buy fake COVID vaccine passports so they
[3:06:57.820 --> 3:07:02.860]  could travel the world without having to get the vaccine and to be frank, who could blame
[3:07:02.860 --> 3:07:03.860]  them.
[3:07:03.860 --> 3:07:08.780]  But when it's the head of a pharmaceutical company literally involved in the vaccine
[3:07:08.780 --> 3:07:13.980]  and developing drugs to treat COVID when it's literally top medical personnel, pushing the
[3:07:13.980 --> 3:07:19.340]  vaccine on other people, pushing the vaccine on children, well, that's quite the story,
[3:07:19.340 --> 3:07:20.340]  isn't it?
[3:07:20.340 --> 3:07:25.140]  And yet how much attention has it received in the West next to zero?
[3:07:25.140 --> 3:07:30.380]  These in Spain have uncovered a scam involving more than 2,000 famous people, including top
[3:07:30.380 --> 3:07:34.580]  medical personnel and the head of a major pharmaceutical company who illegally bought
[3:07:34.580 --> 3:07:39.380]  fake COVID-19 vaccination certificates from a nurse without taking the shot.
[3:07:39.380 --> 3:07:41.500]  Again, this has been going on for two years.
[3:07:41.500 --> 3:07:46.780]  The guy who sold these fake vaccine passports, which they used again to travel around the
[3:07:46.780 --> 3:07:54.780]  world, made more than 200,000 euros personally for adding these rich and famous elites to
[3:07:54.780 --> 3:08:02.260]  a vaccine registry, a national database allowing them to enjoy all the perks that the fully
[3:08:02.260 --> 3:08:07.660]  vaccinated have enjoyed for the past two years, of course, in Spain, which had one of the most
[3:08:07.660 --> 3:08:10.420]  draconian lockdowns in Europe.
[3:08:10.420 --> 3:08:12.820]  They had drones patrolling the beaches.
[3:08:12.820 --> 3:08:18.300]  We featured numerous videos of cops beating up people for not wearing face masks in the
[3:08:18.300 --> 3:08:19.300]  street.
[3:08:19.300 --> 3:08:21.980]  I was there at the height of it.
[3:08:21.980 --> 3:08:26.500]  They literally had a rule where if you were hiking up a mountain, if you were swimming
[3:08:26.500 --> 3:08:29.660]  in the sea, you still had to wear a face mask.
[3:08:29.660 --> 3:08:33.700]  Well, certain people bypass some of those restrictions.
[3:08:33.700 --> 3:08:37.900]  And this article out of Euro Weekly News says, amongst those that have been investigated
[3:08:37.900 --> 3:08:44.260]  by the police are leading singers, musicians, football stars, business people, politicians
[3:08:44.260 --> 3:08:51.060]  and top medical personnel, the very same kind of people who will ingratiate themselves to
[3:08:51.060 --> 3:08:56.260]  public relations campaigns in encouraging others, demanding others to get the shot,
[3:08:56.260 --> 3:08:58.540]  demanding children to get the shot.
[3:08:58.540 --> 3:09:03.580]  And again, people say, well, this is over, and I really do hope it's over.
[3:09:03.580 --> 3:09:09.100]  But again, we saw yesterday, for example, on the view, they're again dragging these pro-regime,
[3:09:09.100 --> 3:09:13.740]  pro-regime narrative doctors on, they're saying when autumn, winter comes, when everyone's
[3:09:13.740 --> 3:09:17.780]  back indoors, they're basically going to keep you indoors, they're going to try and bring
[3:09:17.780 --> 3:09:19.620]  this all back.
[3:09:19.620 --> 3:09:21.860]  Will they do it under the guise of monkeypox?
[3:09:21.860 --> 3:09:22.860]  Probably not.
[3:09:22.860 --> 3:09:24.980]  It's not lethal, not viral enough.
[3:09:24.980 --> 3:09:31.820]  Will they do it under COVID-rebooted now that everyone's been trained to follow orders?
[3:09:31.820 --> 3:09:33.260]  Maybe that will be the case.
[3:09:33.260 --> 3:09:37.700]  But again, the very same people pushing the vaccine involved in all the public relations
[3:09:37.700 --> 3:09:41.300]  campaigns, heads of pharmaceutical companies.
[3:09:41.300 --> 3:09:47.980]  This is the president of Farmer Mar Jose Maria Fernandez, one of the largest pharmaceutical
[3:09:47.980 --> 3:09:53.340]  companies in Spain, a firm that has researched COVID-19 drug treatments.
[3:09:53.340 --> 3:09:56.500]  He did not get his third booster shot.
[3:09:56.500 --> 3:10:02.820]  He probably saw the footballers who were also involved in this illegal scam, who then saw
[3:10:02.820 --> 3:10:08.260]  their colleagues collapsing and dying on football pitches mysteriously with this sudden adult
[3:10:08.260 --> 3:10:10.020]  death syndrome.
[3:10:10.020 --> 3:10:16.300]  So the 76-year-old businessman decided to just pay someone to add his name to a database
[3:10:16.300 --> 3:10:20.340]  and he did not receive the third dose.
[3:10:20.340 --> 3:10:25.740]  And again, this individual who was carrying out this fraud made more than 200,000 euros.
[3:10:25.740 --> 3:10:31.380]  He actually charged people more money based on how famous, how rich they were.
[3:10:31.380 --> 3:10:34.140]  So there was like a tier system.
[3:10:34.140 --> 3:10:38.580]  And again, as I point out in the article, it's interesting that there are numerous sports
[3:10:38.580 --> 3:10:43.460]  personalities and athletes on the list, including footballers, boxers and wrestlers.
[3:10:43.460 --> 3:10:47.980]  Even the reports of a significant spike in adverse reactions and deaths suffered by sports
[3:10:47.980 --> 3:10:50.300]  stars over the last year.
[3:10:50.300 --> 3:10:52.980]  Of course, we reported on that on numerous occasions.
[3:10:52.980 --> 3:10:57.460]  Berlin, a Zeitung, one of the biggest newspapers in Germany, came out with a massive article
[3:10:57.460 --> 3:11:02.900]  that included a giant list of footballers who had had adverse reactions, not just footballers,
[3:11:02.900 --> 3:11:09.020]  other athletes and some who had unfortunately also died.
[3:11:09.020 --> 3:11:14.300]  And as Will Jones of the DailySkeptic points out, let's not forget the biggest scandal
[3:11:14.300 --> 3:11:19.260]  here that the president of a pharmaceutical company would be so wary of taking a drug,
[3:11:19.260 --> 3:11:24.340]  which all the trials and medical authorities insist is safe and effective.
[3:11:24.340 --> 3:11:27.660]  What does he know that he's not letting on?
[3:11:27.660 --> 3:11:32.660]  Again, I briefly mentioned in the previous segment, we had this article, Paris Clinics
[3:11:32.660 --> 3:11:37.700]  offering fake COVID passes for £250 as black market surges.
[3:11:37.700 --> 3:11:40.980]  That was happening summer 2021.
[3:11:40.980 --> 3:11:45.100]  Of course, the French had to have vaccine passports to get into cafes, bars and basically
[3:11:45.100 --> 3:11:47.860]  any public venue.
[3:11:47.860 --> 3:11:52.420]  We also had a headline, French elite caught violating lockdown rules by attending secret
[3:11:52.420 --> 3:11:53.420]  restaurants.
[3:11:53.420 --> 3:11:58.180]  This was during the second lockdown in April 2021.
[3:11:58.180 --> 3:12:02.820]  Again, many restaurants, of course, closed and had the vaccine passports, but many of
[3:12:02.820 --> 3:12:04.980]  them were closed before that.
[3:12:04.980 --> 3:12:11.020]  The ordinary French people, Parisians weren't able to go out, meet their friends, relatives.
[3:12:11.020 --> 3:12:18.140]  The French elite were busy having secret underground posh dinners where the rules were completely
[3:12:18.140 --> 3:12:19.140]  waived.
[3:12:19.140 --> 3:12:23.700]  They had their own staff flown in again, the same French elite pushing the vaccine, pushing
[3:12:23.700 --> 3:12:30.020]  the lockdown measures on everyone else, getting to avoid the consequences of that.
[3:12:30.020 --> 3:12:35.940]  And why would top medical personnel, why would top pharmaceutical presidents want to avoid
[3:12:35.940 --> 3:12:37.140]  getting the vaccine?
[3:12:37.140 --> 3:12:41.260]  Could it have anything to do with this?
[3:12:41.260 --> 3:12:46.620]  Valiant News reports Australians under 40 urged to get hearts checked due to sudden
[3:12:46.620 --> 3:12:48.260]  adult death syndrome.
[3:12:48.260 --> 3:12:55.460]  Yes, it is the mean returned once again, where you have the green lizards quaffing champagne,
[3:12:55.460 --> 3:13:00.220]  quaffing about the vaccine, and then we told them that there's this new thing that's just
[3:13:00.220 --> 3:13:06.020]  emerged out of nowhere called sudden adult death syndrome.
[3:13:06.020 --> 3:13:07.580]  How could that possibly be?
[3:13:07.580 --> 3:13:13.620]  What major event, what major health treatment has been administered to the global population
[3:13:13.620 --> 3:13:17.540]  over the past two years, which could possibly cause this?
[3:13:17.540 --> 3:13:22.420]  Well left to wonder, healthy people under the age of 40 in Australia are being urged to
[3:13:22.420 --> 3:13:27.980]  visit a cardiologist to get their hearts checked, as doctors work to understand a new and mysterious
[3:13:27.980 --> 3:13:31.820]  illness that has been causing unexpected deaths in young people.
[3:13:31.820 --> 3:13:36.220]  And again, this isn't something they've dragged out of the past.
[3:13:36.220 --> 3:13:40.380]  This is they've invented new clinics and new treatment for this and they're now rolling
[3:13:40.380 --> 3:13:42.020]  it out.
[3:13:42.020 --> 3:13:47.940]  Sudden adult death syndrome or SADS, SADS has been found to be deadly for individuals
[3:13:47.940 --> 3:13:52.900]  regardless of whether they maintain a fit and healthy lifestyle or not.
[3:13:52.900 --> 3:13:57.740]  The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners said that SADS is an umbrella term to describe
[3:13:57.740 --> 3:14:03.260]  the sudden deaths in young people, which most commonly occur in people under 40 years of
[3:14:03.260 --> 3:14:04.260]  age.
[3:14:04.260 --> 3:14:06.780]  Just dropping dead like flies, what could that possibly be?
[3:14:06.780 --> 3:14:07.780]  Who knows?
[3:14:07.780 --> 3:14:09.620]  It's a mystery.
[3:14:09.620 --> 3:14:15.100]  Just like the hepatitis outbreaks in kids across the world and some of them dying, some
[3:14:15.100 --> 3:14:20.940]  of them needing urgent organ transplants is also a mystery and nothing whatsoever to do
[3:14:20.940 --> 3:14:26.140]  with the fact that their immune systems are completely shot either from taking the vaccine
[3:14:26.140 --> 3:14:30.820]  or either from lockdown as a result of not developing natural immunity.
[3:14:30.820 --> 3:14:37.180]  But again, we're told it's a mystery and fact-checkers have assured us that that's the proper explanation.
[3:14:37.180 --> 3:14:45.420]  Daily Skeptic reports what's behind the 5,000 non-COVID excess deaths in the last five weeks.
[3:14:45.420 --> 3:14:49.740]  This is in the UK where new official data from the ONS released today added a further
[3:14:49.740 --> 3:14:56.100]  730 non-COVID excess deaths in England and Wales to the total of the last five weeks,
[3:14:56.100 --> 3:15:00.620]  which means nearly 5,000 more people than usual have died in England and Wales in the
[3:15:00.620 --> 3:15:05.060]  last five weeks of causes other than COVID-19.
[3:15:05.060 --> 3:15:12.820]  Now that makes it a total death average of 10.1% above the five-year average and the
[3:15:12.820 --> 3:15:18.220]  writer of this article points out that the new boosters for the elderly for people in
[3:15:18.220 --> 3:15:23.860]  care homes are now slowly being rolled out as we suddenly get, again, this mysterious
[3:15:23.860 --> 3:15:26.380]  excess deaths.
[3:15:26.380 --> 3:15:31.580]  Non-COVID deaths, 10.1% above the five-year average in the United Kingdom over the past
[3:15:31.580 --> 3:15:32.580]  few weeks.
[3:15:32.580 --> 3:15:38.060]  We think that would be a major story given how transfixed the news is with deaths above
[3:15:38.060 --> 3:15:42.780]  the national average, but no, once again, it's being brushed under the carpet.
[3:15:42.780 --> 3:15:45.900]  We're going to come back and we're going to talk about monkey pox.
[3:15:45.900 --> 3:15:50.820]  We're also going to talk about a shocking poll out of the UK which shows the potency
[3:15:50.820 --> 3:15:52.300]  of television brainwashing.
[3:15:52.300 --> 3:15:55.740]  Summit.News will be back.
[3:15:55.740 --> 3:16:00.780]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first-ever Kavakava root supplement that
[3:16:00.780 --> 3:16:04.420]  is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:16:04.420 --> 3:16:08.540]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though
[3:16:08.540 --> 3:16:13.140]  it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and
[3:16:13.140 --> 3:16:15.020]  euphoric effects.
[3:16:15.020 --> 3:16:20.460]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who
[3:16:20.460 --> 3:16:24.740]  they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[3:16:24.740 --> 3:16:29.420]  The Samoan people would drink Kavatee during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to
[3:16:29.420 --> 3:16:30.700]  loosen up a little.
[3:16:30.700 --> 3:16:35.180]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[3:16:35.180 --> 3:16:41.540]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava, but other
[3:16:41.540 --> 3:16:48.260]  herbs including, but not limited to, German Kamamil, organic Skolkapp and Balerian root.
[3:16:48.260 --> 3:16:57.260]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfoWarsStore.com.

[3:17:16.460 --> 3:17:17.460]  to stop it.

[3:17:30.340 --> 3:17:35.060]  So, there's only 15,000 shirts of 60 plus thousand left, and a couple weeks they'll
[3:17:35.060 --> 3:17:41.620]  all be gone and they'll be history, we're selling them all at cost at InfoWarsStore.com.

[3:19:57.620 --> 3:20:15.300]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:15.300 --> 3:20:18.700]  Broadcasting internationally from the summit.news headquarters in the United Kingdom, it's Paul
[3:20:18.700 --> 3:20:27.220]  Joseph Watson, I'm going to go to this first video now because it kind of ties in with
[3:20:27.220 --> 3:20:33.060]  Joe Biden's rambling incoherence last night on Jimmy Kimmel where he said quote, he was
[3:20:33.060 --> 3:20:36.700]  talking about gun control, I don't know what he was on about, nobody even does at this
[3:20:36.700 --> 3:20:37.700]  point.
[3:20:37.700 --> 3:20:43.820]  He's basically geriatric dementia ridden quote, you turn on the TV, look at the ads.
[3:20:43.820 --> 3:20:47.260]  When's the last time you saw biracial couples on TV?
[3:20:47.260 --> 3:20:53.660]  Well every time, especially in the UK, which has led to this poll which is actually quite
[3:20:53.660 --> 3:21:00.460]  shocking given the significant difference in the demographic reality of the makeup of
[3:21:00.460 --> 3:21:07.780]  the United Kingdom and what the British general public thinks is the demographic makeup of
[3:21:07.780 --> 3:21:14.340]  the United Kingdom and it really goes to the point of how easily the general public is
[3:21:14.340 --> 3:21:15.340]  misled.
[3:21:15.340 --> 3:21:17.340]  Let's go to this video, here it is.
[3:21:17.340 --> 3:21:22.420]  The alarming results of a new poll underscore how the general public is so easily led.
[3:21:22.420 --> 3:21:28.420]  A YouGov survey found that the British population thinks minority group to make up a far larger
[3:21:28.420 --> 3:21:31.260]  percentage of the population than is actually the case.
[3:21:31.260 --> 3:21:37.340]  They think 5% of the population is transgender, it's actually around 0.3%.
[3:21:37.340 --> 3:21:43.220]  They think only 65% of the population is white, it's actually around 87%.
[3:21:43.220 --> 3:21:47.020]  They think 20% of the population is black, it's actually 3%.
[3:21:47.020 --> 3:21:51.140]  They think 15% of the population is Muslim, it's actually 4%.
[3:21:51.140 --> 3:21:57.300]  And they think 15% of men in the UK are gay, it's actually 1.3%.
[3:21:57.300 --> 3:22:02.420]  The DailySkeptic asks, is it because minorities are so overrepresented in the mainstream media?
[3:22:02.420 --> 3:22:03.900]  Is the Pope Catholic?
[3:22:03.900 --> 3:22:08.540]  What is the population seeing that's causing them to be so massively misled?
[3:22:08.540 --> 3:22:15.540]  All of these groups being substantially overrepresented on television, particularly in TV commercials
[3:22:15.540 --> 3:22:17.500]  and in advertising generally.
[3:22:17.500 --> 3:22:22.220]  While many of the lobby groups claiming to represent those minorities continually whining
[3:22:22.220 --> 3:22:27.620]  about a lack of representation, it's incredible that when it comes to deciphering the corporeal
[3:22:27.620 --> 3:22:32.780]  reality of the world around them, people place more stock in what they're told to believe
[3:22:32.780 --> 3:22:33.780]  is reality.
[3:22:33.780 --> 3:22:39.300]  By a television, social media and institutionalized culture, then they do their own eyes and real
[3:22:39.300 --> 3:22:41.180]  world experiences.
[3:22:41.180 --> 3:22:45.340]  People delude themselves into thinking that everyone is waking up, but you just have to
[3:22:45.340 --> 3:22:50.940]  accept the fact that much of the general public lacks basic critical thinking skills.
[3:22:50.940 --> 3:22:57.220]  Then a huge chunk of them always have and always will be susceptible to regime narratives.
[3:22:57.220 --> 3:23:00.820]  Case in point, and I drone on about this relentlessly because it never received the
[3:23:00.820 --> 3:23:02.180]  attention it deserved.
[3:23:02.180 --> 3:23:07.740]  In the summer of 2020, a poll was conducted asking Brits about the impact of Covid.
[3:23:07.740 --> 3:23:13.100]  At the time, the official figure of Brits who had died from Covid was 155,000, but the
[3:23:13.100 --> 3:23:19.620]  average Brit when asked, thought that it had killed 6 to 7% of the population.
[3:23:19.620 --> 3:23:22.380]  That's four and a half million people.
[3:23:22.380 --> 3:23:24.060]  Why would they think that?
[3:23:24.060 --> 3:23:29.420]  Regime narratives, television brainwashing, they bang on about misinformation, coercing
[3:23:29.420 --> 3:23:34.780]  people to believe in dangerous non-existent things, yet the constant firehose of social
[3:23:34.780 --> 3:23:40.140]  engineering brought about by regime narratives has created an entire population of people
[3:23:40.140 --> 3:23:48.460]  who can't even accurately grasp the true nature of the immediate world around them.
[3:23:48.460 --> 3:23:55.700]  Now talking about regime narratives, we've got one emerging on the monkeypox virus.
[3:23:55.700 --> 3:24:01.420]  Nightbar reports monkeypox outbreak tops 1,000 cases, WHO warns a real risk.
[3:24:01.420 --> 3:24:06.260]  The risk of monkeypox becoming established in non-endemic nations is real.
[3:24:06.260 --> 3:24:11.180]  The WHO warned Wednesday, and again, I've made the point, part of the reason for that
[3:24:11.180 --> 3:24:17.020]  is they sell what they call bushmeat, which is basically rats and things like that.
[3:24:17.020 --> 3:24:23.700]  Nice delicacies in certain migrant heavy areas of London and other major cities that's contributed
[3:24:23.700 --> 3:24:24.700]  to it.
[3:24:24.700 --> 3:24:30.420]  They came out two weeks ago, of course, the WHO and said it would probably be best to
[3:24:30.420 --> 3:24:36.380]  curtail summer festivals and mass gatherings because that would stop the acceleration
[3:24:36.380 --> 3:24:38.540]  of the spread of monkeypox.
[3:24:38.540 --> 3:24:44.060]  But then, of course, days later, they came out and said, oh, but not gay pride marchers.
[3:24:44.060 --> 3:24:50.780]  Even though it literally emerged, most of the cases in Europe emerged out of a fetish festival
[3:24:50.780 --> 3:24:55.900]  in Belgium, again, you want to expose your kids to this lifestyle, and a gay sauna in
[3:24:55.900 --> 3:25:02.140]  Spain, so they admitted that it was circulating in the gay men population.
[3:25:02.140 --> 3:25:06.060]  But then they said gay pride marchers should go ahead as normal despite the fact that it
[3:25:06.060 --> 3:25:12.260]  spreads via close contact again, just as we literally had top public health officials
[3:25:12.260 --> 3:25:16.820]  and doctors coming out of their surgeries, their practices out of hospitals to applaud
[3:25:16.820 --> 3:25:22.860]  Black Lives Matter protesters back in June 2020, who were out on the streets congregating
[3:25:22.860 --> 3:25:27.940]  in huge numbers, even as they told us that COVID was spreading.
[3:25:27.940 --> 3:25:33.660]  We have another headline, monkeypox patients as he caught virus.
[3:25:33.660 --> 3:25:38.540]  The first one to go public, he was very proud about this, after having gay sex with around
[3:25:38.540 --> 3:25:44.540]  10 new partners, nice, lovely stuff, again, this is what we should expose kids to.
[3:25:44.540 --> 3:25:48.900]  The first monkeypox patients to go public revealed that he caught the virus from having
[3:25:48.900 --> 3:25:54.460]  gay sex with around 10 new partners after being deported from Dubai for testing positive
[3:25:54.460 --> 3:25:55.460]  for HIV.
[3:25:55.460 --> 3:26:03.060]  Yes, he had sex with 10 men, presumably within the space of about two weeks, again, very
[3:26:03.060 --> 3:26:08.860]  healthy, very, very contentful lifestyle that we should be pushing on kids.
[3:26:08.860 --> 3:26:14.820]  This is 35 year old James M, who spoke to the media after complaining of illness and
[3:26:14.820 --> 3:26:18.860]  said the health officials in the UK still haven't contacted him despite him being diagnosed
[3:26:18.860 --> 3:26:22.740]  with monkeypox over two weeks ago.
[3:26:22.740 --> 3:26:30.380]  But again, WHO says no, gay pride marches should go ahead as normal, that's more important.
[3:26:30.380 --> 3:26:35.500]  Norwegian feminists faces three years in prison for saying biological men can't be lesbians
[3:26:35.500 --> 3:26:41.300]  again, this is a marginalized oppressed community, a marginalized oppressed movement, which if
[3:26:41.300 --> 3:26:45.900]  you criticize it in any way, they'll try and get you locked up, and they're endorsed by
[3:26:45.900 --> 3:26:52.700]  every cultural institution, corporation, bank, and government in the West, but they're marginalized
[3:26:52.700 --> 3:26:53.700]  people.
[3:26:53.700 --> 3:26:54.700]  Okay.
[3:26:54.700 --> 3:26:59.340]  Christina Ellingson of the Global Feminist Organization Women's Declaration International
[3:26:59.340 --> 3:27:03.900]  is under police investigation for making the claim in a tweet in which she criticized
[3:27:03.900 --> 3:27:08.700]  how dare she, a trans-activism group, she said, why does FRI teach young people that
[3:27:08.700 --> 3:27:11.260]  males can be lesbians?
[3:27:11.260 --> 3:27:17.500]  Of course, we had a story a few months ago about the Finnish minister, Pavi Rassenen,
[3:27:17.500 --> 3:27:23.420]  who faced hate speech charges for citing Bible verses which describe homosexuality as shameful
[3:27:23.420 --> 3:27:26.660]  and unnatural, although she was later acquitted.
[3:27:26.660 --> 3:27:32.780]  We had Christian pastors on the streets of the UK being arrested by police because some
[3:27:32.780 --> 3:27:38.220]  passerby whined about it because he was reading out a Bible passage.
[3:27:38.220 --> 3:27:42.540]  Last year, officers in Merseyside, also in England, took part in an electronic ad campaign
[3:27:42.540 --> 3:27:48.220]  outside a supermarket, which claimed with a giant banner behind them that being offensive
[3:27:48.220 --> 3:27:49.660]  is an offence.
[3:27:49.660 --> 3:27:53.300]  That's actually not the case, at least at the moment, legally.
[3:27:53.300 --> 3:28:01.420]  We also had, of course, the case up in Hull again in England where a man didn't even tweet
[3:28:01.420 --> 3:28:07.260]  anything, he liked to limerick which poked fun at transgender people, he was investigated
[3:28:07.260 --> 3:28:10.700]  by the police, he was fired from his job.
[3:28:10.700 --> 3:28:15.540]  Meanwhile, UK police force mocked over gay pride tweet, this was Essex police, who, by
[3:28:15.540 --> 3:28:21.740]  the way, literally have people on their turf being stabbed in the street in broad daylight,
[3:28:21.740 --> 3:28:26.580]  apparently they can't deal with that, because they're too busy celebrating diversity by
[3:28:26.580 --> 3:28:31.780]  flying the pride flag to honour those who championed equality, and in this same tweet,
[3:28:31.780 --> 3:28:37.460]  they also politely mentioned, when monitoring our posts, all hate crime will be reported
[3:28:37.460 --> 3:28:43.340]  and investigated, meanwhile, back in 2015, the head of the National Police Chief Union
[3:28:43.340 --> 3:28:48.420]  in the UK said that burglaries would no longer be investigated by the police because they
[3:28:48.420 --> 3:28:52.660]  didn't have the resources, they have the resources for this, we'll be back, summit.news.go
[3:28:52.660 --> 3:28:59.460]  way.
[3:29:22.660 --> 3:29:27.300]  Alex Jones is right on the front, the Red Thunderbolt, and again, on the back, a Big
[3:29:27.300 --> 3:29:29.100]  Bolt InfoWars.com.

[3:29:36.580 --> 3:29:40.780]  There is not a more politically incorrect shirt that sends a stronger message of freedom
[3:29:40.780 --> 3:29:45.340]  resistance to the new world order than the Alex Jones was right shirt, exclusively available
[3:29:45.340 --> 3:29:46.340]  at InfoWars.com.

[3:30:12.420 --> 3:30:16.580]  The bank that owns the mint that has started putting these out the last few years just sold
[3:30:16.580 --> 3:30:22.340]  out of 300,000 of a similar offering that was 40% more than what we're selling these
[3:30:22.340 --> 3:30:23.340]  for.

[3:30:47.300 --> 3:30:48.920]  together would not have happened.
[3:30:48.920 --> 3:30:51.900]  We are the tip of the spear, you are the tip of the spear and I salute you and thank
[3:30:51.900 --> 3:30:52.900]  you.
[3:30:52.900 --> 3:30:53.900]  Visit InfoWarsStore.com today.
[3:30:53.900 --> 3:30:58.660]  You know, it's going back to what we all thought was going to happen in the 90s when
[3:30:58.660 --> 3:31:02.740]  the internet and mobile technology first came out which is we thought, you know, this is
[3:31:02.740 --> 3:31:04.340]  going to level the playing field.
[3:31:04.340 --> 3:31:06.700]  Everybody's going to have access to the same information and everybody's going to be able
[3:31:06.700 --> 3:31:09.500]  to freely communicate that information.
[3:31:09.500 --> 3:31:15.420]  It's our goal to get back to that place where we all have access to all of the information.
[3:31:15.420 --> 3:31:20.460]  We all have the ability to freely communicate that information with whomever we want, whenever
[3:31:20.460 --> 3:31:25.340]  we want and we don't have to worry about anybody tracking what we're doing and trying
[3:31:25.340 --> 3:31:32.580]  to judge us or categorize us or figure out some way to go after us because of the conversations
[3:31:32.580 --> 3:31:37.580]  we're having, because of the internet searches that we're doing, because of the discussions,
[3:31:37.580 --> 3:31:40.060]  the people we want to talk to about these things.
[3:31:40.060 --> 3:31:44.260]  So that's our goal, is to help people take back their freedom by helping them to take
[3:31:44.260 --> 3:31:45.260]  back their privacy.
[3:31:45.260 --> 3:31:50.620]  And so that's really what we're trying to do and so I hope that everybody listening will
[3:31:50.620 --> 3:31:55.620]  check us out at boltowireless.com, that's v-o-l-t-a-wireless.com.
[3:31:55.620 --> 3:32:01.260]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones was right.
[3:32:01.260 --> 3:32:02.700]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[3:32:02.700 --> 3:32:08.460]  Well, it's actually a very sick feeling because I knew this was coming, I tried to stop it
[3:32:08.460 --> 3:32:13.700]  and now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever because
[3:32:13.700 --> 3:32:19.860]  the globalists aren't hiding it anymore in policy reports and documents, it's now out
[3:32:19.860 --> 3:32:20.860]  in the open.
[3:32:20.860 --> 3:32:26.020]  Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg group founded Davos
[3:32:26.020 --> 3:32:27.020]  Group.
[3:32:27.020 --> 3:32:32.140]  So now the fight's out in the open, they're making their move because they know they're
[3:32:32.140 --> 3:32:33.140]  behind schedule.
[3:32:33.140 --> 3:32:36.700]  We're going to win this thing, God's watching, the children are counting on us, I just want
[3:32:36.700 --> 3:32:40.380]  to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial
[3:32:40.380 --> 3:32:43.340]  support because without you, info wars would not be here.
[3:32:43.340 --> 3:32:47.660]  I just want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are
[3:32:47.660 --> 3:32:50.020]  the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[3:32:50.020 --> 3:32:54.540]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble
[3:32:54.540 --> 3:32:56.900]  your efforts.
[3:32:56.900 --> 3:33:25.300]  Being a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:25.300 --> 3:33:39.780]  Now I want to come back and talk about the continuing fallout from this bedlam that occurred
[3:33:39.780 --> 3:33:45.260]  before the Champions League soccer final in Paris a couple of weeks ago because we have
[3:33:45.260 --> 3:33:47.300]  new developments on that.
[3:33:47.300 --> 3:33:52.220]  First though, I want to get into this video that went up just a couple of hours ago rounding
[3:33:52.220 --> 3:33:56.020]  off on the Gay Pride Month content.
[3:33:56.020 --> 3:34:02.060]  Of course I talked about the patrolling of tweets, the Norwegian feminist arrested for
[3:34:02.060 --> 3:34:04.540]  basically say men and men.
[3:34:04.540 --> 3:34:09.500]  We have of course a pride in the park event in Idaho being targeted at children featuring
[3:34:09.500 --> 3:34:14.260]  drag queens and Satanists and this is a wrap up of all that's happened in terms of Gay
[3:34:14.260 --> 3:34:23.620]  Pride Month over the past week, here is the video.
[3:34:23.620 --> 3:34:25.220]  It's Gay Pride Month again.
[3:34:25.220 --> 3:34:28.660]  I keep hearing bigots say it always seems like Gay Pride Month.
[3:34:28.660 --> 3:34:29.660]  Nonsense.
[3:34:29.660 --> 3:34:33.380]  This movement never tries to constantly make itself the center of attention.
[3:34:33.380 --> 3:34:38.100]  Look, just because it's endorsed by every major western government, cultural institution,
[3:34:38.100 --> 3:34:41.860]  corporation, bank, entertainment, industry, organ and legacy media outlet, just because
[3:34:41.860 --> 3:34:45.820]  in many western countries you can get arrested and imprisoned for critiquing them doesn't
[3:34:45.820 --> 3:34:48.060]  mean they're still not marginalised.
[3:34:48.060 --> 3:34:52.340]  The original Gay Pride flag only represents gays, lesbians and bisexuals.
[3:34:52.340 --> 3:34:56.820]  That's not very inclusive by today's standards, it's basically a bigoted throwback on a par
[3:34:56.820 --> 3:34:58.180]  with the confederate flag.
[3:34:58.180 --> 3:35:02.100]  The updated one to that includes pink, white and baby blue for trans representation.
[3:35:02.100 --> 3:35:05.820]  The updated one to that includes black and brown for people of colour representation.
[3:35:05.820 --> 3:35:11.260]  The updated one to that includes hot pink to represent women, don't ask me.
[3:35:11.260 --> 3:35:15.620]  And the updated one to that includes a purple ring on a yellow background to represent intersex
[3:35:15.620 --> 3:35:16.620]  people.
[3:35:16.620 --> 3:35:18.100]  But not even that was enough.
[3:35:18.100 --> 3:35:23.180]  One of the main organisers of Dublin's Gay Pride Parade added the colours of Ukraine
[3:35:23.180 --> 3:35:25.540]  to the LGBTQ rainbow flag.
[3:35:25.540 --> 3:35:28.540]  Too many current things for the poor cannot continue.
[3:35:28.540 --> 3:35:33.060]  They took a flag already more crowded than a tin of sardines and made it more crowded.
[3:35:33.060 --> 3:35:38.340]  Once again, woke transnational corporations went full rainbow washing to secure that pink
[3:35:38.340 --> 3:35:43.900]  and while mysteriously forgetting to update their logos and branding in a certain part
[3:35:43.900 --> 3:35:47.980]  of the world, it's that time of the year again, Gay Pride Vaseline.
[3:35:47.980 --> 3:35:54.500]  The exact same product, just double the price, Gay Pride Vaseline.
[3:35:54.500 --> 3:35:57.980]  I prefer really not to speak.
[3:35:57.980 --> 3:36:03.020]  If I speak I am in big trouble, in big trouble and I don't want to be in big trouble.
[3:36:03.020 --> 3:36:07.140]  Burger King is celebrating Pride Month by allowing you to choose top or bottom bread
[3:36:07.140 --> 3:36:08.140]  bap.
[3:36:08.140 --> 3:36:10.140]  That'll stop Saudi Arabia beheading the gays.
[3:36:10.140 --> 3:36:15.140]  Q8's government summoned a top U.S. diplomat in a minor international spat.
[3:36:15.140 --> 3:36:16.140]  Why?
[3:36:16.140 --> 3:36:19.140]  Because the U.S. Embassy in Q8 tweeted its endorsement of Gay Pride Month.
[3:36:19.140 --> 3:36:20.140]  Well this is awkward.
[3:36:20.140 --> 3:36:22.940]  Gay Pride March on the Q80 Embassy in D.C.
[3:36:22.940 --> 3:36:24.260]  Yeah, don't hold your breath.
[3:36:24.260 --> 3:36:29.620]  A Pride in the Park event in Idaho to mark Gay Pride Month geared towards children will
[3:36:29.620 --> 3:36:34.340]  include the participation of drag queens as well as Satanists who have vowed to perform
[3:36:34.340 --> 3:36:35.340]  un-Baptisms.
[3:36:35.340 --> 3:36:37.580]  Hands, are we the baddies?
[3:36:37.580 --> 3:36:43.420]  Bigots say kids shouldn't be exposed to LGBT themes or Gay Pride marches, nonsense.
[3:36:43.420 --> 3:36:48.220]  Why wouldn't we want to enroll kids into such a healthy lifestyle of lifelong joy and contentment?
[3:36:48.220 --> 3:36:53.380]  They claim it's an inherently sexualized environment that children should be kept away from.
[3:36:53.380 --> 3:36:57.580]  But the World Health Organization's Andy Seal said Gay Pride parades were family-friendly.
[3:36:57.580 --> 3:36:59.580]  And who could argue with him?
[3:36:59.580 --> 3:37:06.580]  Who wants to be a diva for the day?
[3:37:06.580 --> 3:37:27.580]  Yeah, if you want to come back here with me, walk with me.
[3:37:27.580 --> 3:37:32.580]  They're family-friendly.
[3:37:32.580 --> 3:37:37.820]  They're filled with sites that may be new to kids, like public nudity and kink.
[3:37:37.820 --> 3:37:40.540]  So is it appropriate to take your young kids to Pride?
[3:37:40.540 --> 3:37:48.420]  The answer is absolutely family-friendly, child-appropriate, public nudity and kink.
[3:37:48.420 --> 3:37:53.740]  Who would have a problem with that?
[3:37:53.740 --> 3:37:56.420]  I'm getting the word, nonsense.
[3:37:56.420 --> 3:37:58.020]  This slope feels awful slippery.
[3:37:58.020 --> 3:38:03.420]  Now Senator Scott Wiener wants to add Drag Queen 101 to the K-12 curriculum.
[3:38:03.420 --> 3:38:13.060]  I mean, let's be honest, childhood innocence, that's just a concept invented out of thin
[3:38:13.060 --> 3:38:14.620]  air by prejudice homophobes.
[3:38:14.620 --> 3:38:19.180]  The WHO, the Global Health Authority tasked with stopping the spread of viruses, warned
[3:38:19.180 --> 3:38:23.700]  that summer festivals and mass gatherings could accelerate the spread of monkeypox.
[3:38:23.700 --> 3:38:26.620]  But then asserted that gay pride marchers should go ahead as normal.
[3:38:26.620 --> 3:38:31.620]  Meanwhile, the first monkeypox patient to go public revealed that he caught the virus
[3:38:31.620 --> 3:38:37.300]  from having gay sex with around 10 new partners after being deported from Dubai for testing
[3:38:37.300 --> 3:38:38.780]  positive for HIV.
[3:38:38.780 --> 3:38:39.780]  Lovely stuff.
[3:38:39.780 --> 3:38:45.020]  They say life imitates art, but increasingly, it feels like life imitates memes.
[3:38:45.020 --> 3:38:50.620]  Remember all those memes about the military-industrial complex, legitimizing its neo-imperialist wars
[3:38:50.620 --> 3:38:56.220]  of conquest and occupation by painting the bombs in LGBT rainbow colors?
[3:38:56.220 --> 3:38:59.780]  Yeah, well the US Marines literally just fulfilled that meme.
[3:38:59.780 --> 3:39:03.820]  Proud to serve and look, gay bullets.
[3:39:03.820 --> 3:39:06.260]  Another Babylon B headline becomes reality.
[3:39:06.260 --> 3:39:10.500]  Next time people start whining about another Middle Eastern country being destroyed and
[3:39:10.500 --> 3:39:16.460]  obliterated for generations, just call them homophobes, lest we forget transgender Ukrainian
[3:39:16.460 --> 3:39:20.900]  troops who now go to war under the insignia of a gay unicorn.
[3:39:20.900 --> 3:39:25.060]  The image of a unicorn sewn into its standard issue epaulettes.
[3:39:25.060 --> 3:39:29.740]  Romanova identifies as non-binary and uses she-her pronouns.
[3:39:29.740 --> 3:39:34.820]  As off battalion eat your heart out, maybe if Wenzelensky's democratic stormtroopers
[3:39:34.820 --> 3:39:38.780]  had gone daunted or kidnapping dissidents for criticizing him, they'd have just done
[3:39:38.780 --> 3:39:42.020]  so under the banner of a multicolored mythical beast.
[3:39:42.020 --> 3:39:44.300]  It would have seemed more tolerant.
[3:39:44.300 --> 3:39:48.860]  Central Tampa Bay baseball players opted out of displaying support for gay pride by refusing
[3:39:48.860 --> 3:39:54.540]  to wear Pride Night uniforms, citing their belief in Jesus Christ as the reason.
[3:39:54.540 --> 3:40:02.220]  They're trying to use religious exemptions to affect the opportunities, services, available
[3:40:02.220 --> 3:40:05.220]  resources for people who are LGBTQ plus.
[3:40:05.220 --> 3:40:06.220]  Bravo.
[3:40:06.220 --> 3:40:09.980]  Wear the gay rights clothing or you're denying gay people their rights.
[3:40:09.980 --> 3:40:12.540]  It's no longer enough just to tolerate it.
[3:40:12.540 --> 3:40:15.140]  Your regime demands you perform your loyalty oath.
[3:40:15.140 --> 3:40:18.420]  Remember, they're a marginalised community on train.
[3:40:18.420 --> 3:40:22.140]  Pride event or something happening in Glasgow trained full of Pride attendees.
[3:40:22.140 --> 3:40:26.020]  Random girl handing out Pride flags offers me one, can't refuse because it might be
[3:40:26.020 --> 3:40:30.020]  a hate crime, can't throw it away because it might be a hate crime, had to hold it.
[3:40:30.020 --> 3:40:31.300]  Literally 1984.
[3:40:31.300 --> 3:40:36.820]  We celebrate diversity by raising the Pride Progress flag for Pride Month at our HQ and
[3:40:36.820 --> 3:40:39.460]  to honour those who've championed for equality before us.
[3:40:39.460 --> 3:40:43.500]  Monitoring our posts or hate crime will be reported and investigated.
[3:40:43.500 --> 3:40:47.700]  But monitoring criminals who are stabbing people in the street in broad daylight?
[3:40:47.700 --> 3:40:50.700]  Not so much.
[3:40:50.700 --> 3:40:57.860]  BBC changed rape victims' quotes to avoid misgendering her trans attacker.
[3:40:57.860 --> 3:40:59.660]  What if he rapes me?
[3:40:59.660 --> 3:41:02.660]  What if she rapes you?
[3:41:02.660 --> 3:41:11.220]  There you have it, let's switch now to Europe news where we have continued fallout from the
[3:41:11.220 --> 3:41:14.820]  bedlam that occurred before the Champions League final in Paris a couple of weekends
[3:41:14.820 --> 3:41:15.820]  ago.
[3:41:15.820 --> 3:41:21.940]  Spain's Vox party warns of danger of multicultural hotspots after Champions League chaos.
[3:41:21.940 --> 3:41:26.340]  Of course what happened before the game between Liverpool and Real Madrid in Paris at the
[3:41:26.340 --> 3:41:32.660]  Stade de France, this heavily migrant area, Saint-Denis, Paris, where 400,000 illegal
[3:41:32.660 --> 3:41:38.220]  immigrants live, they saw the visiting supporters football fans as easy prey, robbed them in
[3:41:38.220 --> 3:41:41.380]  some cases, stripped them of clothing, attacked them.
[3:41:41.380 --> 3:41:47.900]  The local French riot police in Paris responded by teargassing the innocent Liverpool supporters.
[3:41:47.900 --> 3:41:53.500]  There was a big cover-up, there was a poll of French people which found 76% of respondents
[3:41:53.500 --> 3:41:56.460]  did not believe the official story.
[3:41:56.460 --> 3:42:01.780]  Well now we have the leader of the Spain's Vox party responding to that warning quote.
[3:42:01.780 --> 3:42:07.060]  We still have time to prevent the Spanish cities of Acera, El Pulche or Salt from becoming
[3:42:07.060 --> 3:42:08.060]  Saint-Denis.
[3:42:08.060 --> 3:42:12.860]  He went on to say we need to protect the borders and the poll effect for migrants, increase
[3:42:12.860 --> 3:42:18.380]  the police presence and the free social benefits buffet and stop bowing our heads to political
[3:42:18.380 --> 3:42:19.380]  correctness.
[3:42:19.380 --> 3:42:24.580]  They're going to bring it in front of the European Parliament next year next week to
[3:42:24.580 --> 3:42:29.980]  try and get answers on what they're going to do about these migrant no-go zones, which
[3:42:29.980 --> 3:42:35.860]  you'll recall four years ago, five years ago, the media claimed did not even exist.
[3:42:35.860 --> 3:42:40.460]  Going to come back on the other side, talk about the Jubilee, talk about what happened
[3:42:40.460 --> 3:42:46.820]  yesterday in Berlin with that strange vehicle attack on people in Germany.
[3:42:46.820 --> 3:42:53.820]  We'll be back, summit.news, don't go away.

[3:44:38.420 --> 3:44:40.740]  the spear, the InfoWars operation.
[3:44:40.740 --> 3:44:42.100]  It is a 360 win.
[3:44:42.100 --> 3:44:46.580]  The only way you fail is by not taking action and getting this product to boost your body's
[3:44:46.580 --> 3:44:49.220]  natural defenses and keep InfoWars on the air.
[3:44:49.220 --> 3:44:51.660]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action.
[3:44:51.660 --> 3:44:55.820]  Take action now, InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:44:55.820 --> 3:45:01.460]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones was right.
[3:45:01.460 --> 3:45:02.980]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[3:45:02.980 --> 3:45:08.660]  Well, it's actually very sick feeling because I knew this was coming, I tried to stop it
[3:45:08.660 --> 3:45:13.900]  and now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever because
[3:45:13.900 --> 3:45:19.060]  the globalists aren't hiding anymore in policy reports and documents.
[3:45:19.060 --> 3:45:20.660]  It's now out in the open.
[3:45:20.660 --> 3:45:26.260]  Clausewab said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg group founded Davos
[3:45:26.260 --> 3:45:27.260]  Group.
[3:45:27.260 --> 3:45:32.340]  So now the fight's out in the open, they're making their move because they know they're
[3:45:32.340 --> 3:45:33.460]  behind schedule.
[3:45:33.460 --> 3:45:34.460]  We're going to win this thing.
[3:45:34.460 --> 3:45:36.300]  God's watching the children counting on us.
[3:45:36.300 --> 3:45:40.100]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and
[3:45:40.100 --> 3:45:43.540]  your financial support because without you, InfoWars would not be here.
[3:45:43.540 --> 3:45:47.860]  I just want you to really internalize the fact that you are the InfoWars and you are
[3:45:47.860 --> 3:45:50.220]  the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[3:45:50.220 --> 3:45:54.740]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble
[3:45:54.740 --> 3:45:55.740]  your efforts.
[3:45:55.740 --> 3:45:59.340]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported InfoWars financially with
[3:45:59.340 --> 3:46:01.300]  word of mouth and prayer.
[3:46:01.300 --> 3:46:04.700]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists and the fact that we're not
[3:46:04.700 --> 3:46:09.300]  caught flat footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[3:46:09.300 --> 3:46:11.900]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[3:46:11.900 --> 3:46:15.660]  That's what I want to thank you all for buying products and InfoWars.com like books and films
[3:46:15.660 --> 3:46:19.020]  and supplements and water filtration, air filtration, so much more.

[3:46:56.540 --> 3:47:08.340]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:08.340 --> 3:47:13.900]  You're listening to the Summit.News Radio Hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:47:13.900 --> 3:47:23.540]  So we have a continuing cover-up of what happened before the Champions League final two weekends
[3:47:23.540 --> 3:47:29.460]  ago where groups of migrant youths from the local area attacked supporters visiting tourists
[3:47:29.460 --> 3:47:31.220]  or them as easy prey.
[3:47:31.220 --> 3:47:36.180]  The media covered it up, the police covered it up, they blamed Liverpool supporters, 30
[3:47:36.180 --> 3:47:41.340]  to 40,000 of them without tickets, completely made up out of thin air.
[3:47:41.340 --> 3:47:45.620]  Now we have this headline, Paris Police Chief says teargassing of football fans at Champions
[3:47:45.620 --> 3:47:50.740]  League final was a mistake after it all came to light that they weren't responsible, they
[3:47:50.740 --> 3:47:56.020]  still won't admit who the true culprits were because that would prove that maybe diversity
[3:47:56.020 --> 3:47:57.020]  is in the strength.
[3:47:57.020 --> 3:48:01.700]  Of course, the stad to France in this heavily migrant area where 400,000 illegal immigrants
[3:48:01.700 --> 3:48:04.980]  live is going to be host to the 2024 Olympics.
[3:48:04.980 --> 3:48:11.500]  So they've got major problems in the pipeline, remix reports France, three Algerian migrants
[3:48:11.500 --> 3:48:14.580]  arrested for slitting 70-year-old woman's throat.
[3:48:14.580 --> 3:48:18.500]  We continue to see stories like that on a daily basis.
[3:48:18.500 --> 3:48:23.780]  Then we have the strange incident in Germany yesterday where what they called a German
[3:48:23.780 --> 3:48:29.260]  citizen who had Armenian migrant background plowed a car into a group of people outside
[3:48:29.260 --> 3:48:34.220]  a cafe, went back onto the road, came back onto the pavement, smashed into a bunch of
[3:48:34.220 --> 3:48:37.500]  other people, smashed into a shop window.
[3:48:37.500 --> 3:48:43.820]  It subsequently emerged that they found political material in his vehicle and yet now 24 hours
[3:48:43.820 --> 3:48:48.380]  later the official explanation is once again mental illness.
[3:48:48.380 --> 3:48:51.900]  This is the clip, the Berlin car attack.
[3:48:51.900 --> 3:48:52.900]  Let's roll it.
[3:48:52.900 --> 3:48:57.780]  A man in Berlin deliberately drove into crowds of people before smashing into a shop window
[3:48:57.780 --> 3:48:59.460]  in an apparent terrorist attack.
[3:48:59.460 --> 3:49:04.620]  One teacher was tragically killed while at least 30 suffered injuries, some of them life-threatening.
[3:49:04.620 --> 3:49:07.900]  12 of the victims were on a student class trip.
[3:49:07.900 --> 3:49:11.820]  Actor John Barrowman, who was an eyewitness to the events, made clear that the killer
[3:49:11.820 --> 3:49:13.940]  deliberately targeted his victims.
[3:49:13.940 --> 3:49:19.740]  Quote, we are no experts but this looks intentional, he said, by the way the car went on the pavement.
[3:49:19.740 --> 3:49:24.020]  Up there the car came down onto the pavement.
[3:49:24.020 --> 3:49:26.740]  We had dinner in that restaurant last night.
[3:49:26.740 --> 3:49:32.500]  The car came down onto the pavement, then has come onto the road over there, has hit
[3:49:32.500 --> 3:49:40.820]  somebody, then has gone down the road and come back onto the pavement down that way
[3:49:40.820 --> 3:49:45.820]  and come back onto the pavement and gone through a bunch of people, gone through the photograph
[3:49:45.820 --> 3:49:51.580]  that I posted of a cafe and then right into a storefront window.
[3:49:51.580 --> 3:49:55.580]  British architect Scott Gill told Sky News Quote, you could see the car had zig-zagged
[3:49:55.580 --> 3:49:57.460]  on and off the pavement on the way down.
[3:49:57.460 --> 3:50:02.260]  An apparent confession letter was subsequently found in the vehicle, although Berlin State
[3:50:02.260 --> 3:50:07.420]  Interior Minister Iris Springer disagreed with this description and said that placards had
[3:50:07.420 --> 3:50:08.420]  been found.
[3:50:08.420 --> 3:50:11.460]  Did they say? Authorities aren't revealing that at this time.
[3:50:11.460 --> 3:50:15.940]  German news outlet Build reports that the documents found in the car related to Turkey.
[3:50:15.940 --> 3:50:20.860]  The suspect has been identified as Gore H, a man who obtained German citizenship but had
[3:50:20.860 --> 3:50:22.980]  an Armenian migrant background.
[3:50:22.980 --> 3:50:24.980]  Here's a clip of him being detained by police.
[3:50:24.980 --> 3:50:43.820]  Although this incident doesn't look like it's Islamist related, the attack occurred at virtually
[3:50:43.820 --> 3:50:48.420]  the same site as the 2016 Jihadist truck attack on a Christmas market.
[3:50:48.420 --> 3:50:53.260]  While the man's motivation remains unknown, Germany has been hit by similar violent attacks
[3:50:53.260 --> 3:50:57.300]  since it threw open its borders to mass migration in 2015.
[3:50:57.300 --> 3:51:02.140]  Despite this, the country's spy agency seems more interested in keeping tabs on right-wing
[3:51:02.140 --> 3:51:05.460]  Pegida demonstrators and anti-lockdown protesters.
[3:51:05.460 --> 3:51:09.940]  After a Somali migrant went on a stabbing rampage that left three women dead in June
[3:51:09.940 --> 3:51:14.300]  last year, the mayor of Würzburg reacted by writing an open letter expressing concern
[3:51:14.300 --> 3:51:17.260]  about the stigmatization of refugees and migrants.
[3:51:17.260 --> 3:51:22.140]  The former director of Germany's Foreign Intelligence Service accused former Chancellor
[3:51:22.140 --> 3:51:26.820]  Angela Merkel of creating a security crisis in Germany as a result of her open border
[3:51:26.820 --> 3:51:32.780]  refugee policy, with authorities clueless as to the identity of up to 300,000 people
[3:51:32.780 --> 3:51:33.780]  in the country.
[3:51:33.780 --> 3:51:38.780]  Despite previously admitting that multiculturalism had failed, Merkel claimed integrating the
[3:51:38.780 --> 3:51:42.780]  more than one million migrants who arrived in the past seven years had been a success.
[3:51:42.780 --> 3:51:46.900]  Although the victims of violent crimes in Germany, which have been soaring in recent
[3:51:46.900 --> 3:51:52.220]  years, and the over a thousand women who were molested in cologne on New Year's Eve 2015
[3:51:52.220 --> 3:51:56.420]  by gangs of North African migrants, will probably beg to differ.
[3:51:56.420 --> 3:51:59.420]  There you have it.
[3:51:59.420 --> 3:52:04.540]  Now I want to get to this final video because of course we had the Queen's Platinum Jubilee
[3:52:04.540 --> 3:52:07.540]  here last weekend in the United Kingdom.
[3:52:07.540 --> 3:52:13.780]  The last vestigial gristle of acceptable patriotism that you're allowed to display is basically
[3:52:13.780 --> 3:52:17.980]  reverence for the royal family, for the Queen.
[3:52:17.980 --> 3:52:22.860]  I don't really care either way about them, but it was nice to see the British flags,
[3:52:22.860 --> 3:52:26.180]  the bunting, flying high over the course of the past two weeks.
[3:52:26.180 --> 3:52:31.860]  It was also interesting to see the odious irony and hypocrisy from the left, the same
[3:52:31.860 --> 3:52:39.660]  people who for the past four, five, six years plus have celebratory flown EU flags, effusively
[3:52:39.660 --> 3:52:46.380]  flown Ukrainian flags, they're now of course flying gay pride flags, while simultaneously
[3:52:46.380 --> 3:52:53.220]  calling you a quote flag shagger for flying the flag of our own country.
[3:52:53.220 --> 3:52:59.620]  But again, this video gets to the true narrative about why the Jubilee felt more like awake
[3:52:59.620 --> 3:53:02.220]  than an actual celebration.
[3:53:02.220 --> 3:53:04.900]  Here is the clip, the strange Jubilee.
[3:53:04.900 --> 3:53:05.900]  Let's roll it.
[3:53:05.900 --> 3:53:09.820]  While I couldn't really give a toss about the royal family one way or the other, national
[3:53:09.820 --> 3:53:15.940]  respect for the institution itself and for the Queen is one of the last acceptable vestiges
[3:53:15.940 --> 3:53:17.780]  of British patriotism.
[3:53:17.780 --> 3:53:22.740]  I had no problem with the country basically taking half a week off to stage one huge civic-minded
[3:53:22.740 --> 3:53:26.780]  party because God knows the last two years have been miserable enough.
[3:53:26.780 --> 3:53:31.540]  The usual suspects, however, the same crowd who will deny until they're blue in the face
[3:53:31.540 --> 3:53:35.820]  that they hate the country in which they live, got noticeably more techie as the
[3:53:35.820 --> 3:53:37.780]  platinum Jubilee approached.
[3:53:37.780 --> 3:53:43.780]  The same people in the UK who have been straining at the leash to fly EU flags for years and
[3:53:43.780 --> 3:53:49.700]  Ukraine flags for months were suddenly deeply disturbed by the sight of the Union Jack,
[3:53:49.700 --> 3:53:51.460]  the flag of their own country.
[3:53:51.460 --> 3:53:57.660]  Some even compared it to a North Korean military parade or a Nazi rally in 1930s Berlin.
[3:53:57.660 --> 3:54:02.100]  Civic nationalists on the centre right heralded the Jubilee as proof that Britain is a country
[3:54:02.100 --> 3:54:06.100]  where race is no longer a central feature of British national identity.
[3:54:06.100 --> 3:54:11.620]  Yet if you looked at pictures of crowds out celebrating the Jubilee, they weren't exactly
[3:54:11.620 --> 3:54:12.620]  very diverse.
[3:54:12.620 --> 3:54:18.140]  There was a shocking lack of diversity on display in London where white Brits are now a minority
[3:54:18.140 --> 3:54:19.580]  in the capital of England.
[3:54:19.580 --> 3:54:25.700]  I haven't seen that many white people gathered in one place in London since Live Aid in 1985.
[3:54:25.700 --> 3:54:30.460]  Outside of London, the Jubilee was more warmly embraced in less diverse villages than it
[3:54:30.460 --> 3:54:32.060]  was in bigger towns.
[3:54:32.060 --> 3:54:36.820]  During a visit to a town on Saturday, I saw almost as many Ukraine flags as I did British.
[3:54:36.820 --> 3:54:41.700]  At the start of Jubilee week, residents of Nelson Lancashire were expecting to see the
[3:54:41.700 --> 3:54:47.860]  Union flag flying over the town hall, only instead to see the Palestinian flag hoisted
[3:54:47.860 --> 3:54:48.860]  high.
[3:54:48.860 --> 3:54:53.500]  The town has a Muslim population of 37% and the person responsible for the decision to
[3:54:53.500 --> 3:54:57.900]  fly the Palestinian flag is Labour group leader Mohammed Iqbal.
[3:54:57.900 --> 3:55:02.580]  What was strange about the Jubilee however was that it didn't really feel like a celebration
[3:55:02.580 --> 3:55:03.580]  of Britain.
[3:55:03.580 --> 3:55:07.860]  More like a wake for a Britain that used to exist but is no longer with us.
[3:55:07.860 --> 3:55:12.340]  The plethora of Beatles tribute acts that played in shayas and villages up and down
[3:55:12.340 --> 3:55:17.900]  the country only seemed to add to an atmosphere that felt more melancholy than carnival-like.
[3:55:17.900 --> 3:55:22.420]  The fact that we basically no longer have proper functioning borders and that Englishness
[3:55:22.420 --> 3:55:27.300]  and Britishness has been watered down to such an extent that most feel the need to constantly
[3:55:27.300 --> 3:55:32.620]  apologise for being English or British made the whole event come off more as a damp squib
[3:55:32.620 --> 3:55:34.180]  than a bawdy knees up.
[3:55:34.180 --> 3:55:38.620]  The rain that soaked the country on the final day of the commemoration was probably one
[3:55:38.620 --> 3:55:43.420]  of the only truly British things that will wholeheartedly survive if the Queen makes
[3:55:43.420 --> 3:55:49.900]  it to her next Jubilee in ten years time.
[3:55:49.900 --> 3:55:54.420]  Now of course we have the media continuing to tell us that basically Russia is losing,
[3:55:54.420 --> 3:55:58.860]  they're about to collapse, Ukraine is winning even as Russia apparently take over all these
[3:55:58.860 --> 3:56:05.620]  towns and different areas but rest assured the Ukrainian government has found a way
[3:56:05.620 --> 3:56:12.980]  to completely and totally vanquish Putin's war machine once and for all and it is to
[3:56:12.980 --> 3:56:23.820]  ban the 1869 historical novel classic by Tolstoy's War and Peace and other classical
[3:56:23.820 --> 3:56:28.220]  historical novels that portray the Russian military in anything other than a negative
[3:56:28.220 --> 3:56:30.540]  light will be banned from being taught.
[3:56:30.540 --> 3:56:34.820]  In Ukrainian schools they're going to make a list of books that need to be banned, they've
[3:56:34.820 --> 3:56:40.660]  already banned Siberian cats from performing in international cat competitions, they banned
[3:56:40.660 --> 3:56:48.060]  Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing at Wimbledon so this will definitely stop
[3:56:48.060 --> 3:56:51.020]  the onslaught of the Russian tanks.
[3:56:51.020 --> 3:56:55.860]  Meanwhile Ukrainian official admits she lied about Russians committing mass rape to convince
[3:56:55.860 --> 3:57:01.380]  countries to send more weapons, when she made these claims at the time CNN, Washington
[3:57:01.380 --> 3:57:05.900]  Post, a bunch of other legacy media outlets amplified it, reported on it as if it was
[3:57:05.900 --> 3:57:12.780]  gospel turned out that she was actually fired as a result of a vote in the Ukrainian parliament
[3:57:12.780 --> 3:57:19.740]  by a vast margin of 234 to 9 because she pushed misinformation that the Ukrainian parliament
[3:57:19.740 --> 3:57:25.460]  said quote only harmed Ukraine by falsely blaming Russian troops for the mass sexual
[3:57:25.460 --> 3:57:31.580]  assault of women and for child sexual abuses, she completely made it up out of thin air.
[3:57:31.580 --> 3:57:35.820]  Now she's out but she said it to get the foreign countries to send the weapons and that at
[3:57:35.820 --> 3:57:38.180]  least in the short term has worked.
[3:57:38.180 --> 3:57:50.500]  That's going to wrap it up for Summit.News,
