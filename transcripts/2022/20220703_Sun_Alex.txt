[00:00.000 --> 00:15.800]  It's Sunday, July 3rd, 2022, I'm your host Alex Jones, I'm extremely honored and blessed
[00:15.800 --> 00:20.080]  to be here with you, I'm very thankful you care to spend time with us in the battle for
[00:20.080 --> 00:24.480]  a human future against the new world war.
[00:24.480 --> 00:31.240]  An anti-human synthetic system is being set up and I've said this a thousand times
[00:31.240 --> 00:34.920]  and I'm sure if I'm able to stay on air the next few years I'll say it a thousand times
[00:34.920 --> 00:36.420]  more.
[00:36.420 --> 00:41.760]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[00:41.760 --> 00:47.120]  The globalist fight around the clock to surveil and censor and attack our speech because
[00:47.120 --> 00:53.360]  everything they're doing is dystopia by design and no one in their right mind would go along
[00:53.360 --> 00:58.640]  with it and accept it if they weren't bullied and gas-lit into submission.
[00:58.640 --> 01:06.920]  If the situation was hopeless their propaganda would not be necessary.
[01:06.920 --> 01:15.800]  Again, if it was hopeless they would not need to be trying to censor and bombard us continually.
[01:15.800 --> 01:23.760]  We can, we must and we will prevail against this evil.
[01:23.760 --> 01:30.280]  July 4th is approaching, our nation's birthday and our nation's far from perfect but it's
[01:30.280 --> 01:37.720]  been very special because it enshrined the idea of God-given rights and the individual
[01:37.720 --> 01:44.120]  has the power to lead their own life as long as they don't hurt other individuals.
[01:44.120 --> 01:51.680]  And it's that idea that is in direct counter-valence to the corporate, authoritarian, transhumanist
[01:51.680 --> 01:59.800]  world government and that's why this nation and its ideas, though never fully realized,
[01:59.800 --> 02:00.800]  are under attack.
[02:00.800 --> 02:05.440]  That's why people from around the world wanted to come here, wanted to be part of America
[02:05.440 --> 02:12.200]  because compared to where they came from this place was the promised land and you can't
[02:12.200 --> 02:19.600]  have a world-wide tyranny, you can't have total darkness and absolute control and the
[02:19.600 --> 02:22.440]  authoritarianism of the transhumanist system.
[02:22.440 --> 02:31.640]  If there's greener pastures somewhere else you just can't get away with your post-human
[02:31.640 --> 02:36.480]  new world order if the people have any options.
[02:36.480 --> 02:39.240]  And that's the simple fact.
[02:39.240 --> 02:45.120]  And everything you see is a war against independence, a war against the individual, a war against
[02:45.120 --> 02:53.760]  upper mobility, a war against freedom, an economic and religious and cultural choice
[02:53.760 --> 03:05.120]  even over your own body with their poison injections masquerading as vaccines.
[03:05.120 --> 03:11.600]  So today, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to be laying out some of the current big developments
[03:11.600 --> 03:19.160]  that are massive, that are unspeakably wicked, we'll also be looking at some of the positive
[03:19.160 --> 03:25.080]  things that are happening as the global awakening and the counter to this tyranny accelerates.
[03:25.080 --> 03:28.760]  They're preparing new lockdowns, preparing new viral scares, we told you that was coming
[03:28.760 --> 03:33.960]  six, seven months ago, we told you it would be monkeypox because we see them pre-programming
[03:33.960 --> 03:35.120]  and preparing it.
[03:35.120 --> 03:37.840]  The truth is when you're awake, you're awake and you see it all.
[03:37.840 --> 03:42.280]  And those of us that are awake say, why can't the public figure this out and it's because
[03:42.280 --> 03:43.880]  they are asleep.
[03:43.880 --> 03:50.360]  So it's our jobs to wake people up however we can so they will not fall prey to this
[03:50.360 --> 03:56.080]  high-tech tyranny that we are all facing here in the year 2022, but I have to tell you
[03:56.080 --> 04:00.160]  the mere fact that we're still on air, the mere fact that we are here reaching millions
[04:00.160 --> 04:03.960]  of people thanks to your support and your word of mouth and your prayer is incredible
[04:03.960 --> 04:11.240]  and it enrages the authoritarians and their minions that have signed on to this evil because
[04:11.240 --> 04:14.680]  they know in the end they are destined to lose.
[04:14.680 --> 04:17.240]  That's why they wage war against common sense.
[04:17.240 --> 04:20.080]  That's why they wage war against God's order.
[04:20.080 --> 04:23.960]  That's why they wage war against everything that is to be human because what we have
[04:23.960 --> 04:29.320]  is good and what we have is strong, what we have is beautiful and they can't contend
[04:29.320 --> 04:30.320]  with that.
[04:30.320 --> 04:35.600]  So that's why they sell poverty and ugliness and strife and conflict and division in the
[04:35.600 --> 04:39.040]  name of their great New World Order unity.
[04:39.040 --> 04:43.600]  All right, big Sunday broadcast lined up for you today.

[06:03.120 --> 06:19.600]  You are listening to an infoawards.com frontline report, it's Alex Jones and it's Sunday, July
[06:19.600 --> 06:20.600]  3rd, 2022.
[06:20.600 --> 06:22.600]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[06:22.600 --> 06:25.960]  I'm just going to tell it like it is.
[06:25.960 --> 06:34.840]  I declare this July 4th, 2022 to be a declaration of independence against the alien force on
[06:34.840 --> 06:40.000]  this planet today, waging war against humans and our biology and our very future that is
[06:40.000 --> 06:46.440]  attempting to exterminate the majority of us and force the minority that's left to merge
[06:46.440 --> 06:52.840]  with AI computers and become cyborg slaves of Satan.
[06:52.840 --> 06:59.960]  Now you've heard Elon Musk last year say beware billionaires that worship AI gods and he tells
[06:59.960 --> 07:03.280]  you the global elite believe they're going to transcend humans and are going to create
[07:03.280 --> 07:09.080]  alien life forms, new life forms, the merger of humans and machines here on earth and human
[07:09.080 --> 07:11.560]  animal hybrids merging with machines.
[07:11.560 --> 07:14.120]  That is alien.
[07:14.120 --> 07:20.920]  We received a DNA gene sequence in a radio transmission from deep space hypothetically
[07:20.920 --> 07:29.360]  and with now CRISPR gene editing systems, if scientists put together that new creature
[07:29.360 --> 07:36.000]  and then planted the embryo inside say a cow's uterus to grow it as they do humanoids now,
[07:36.000 --> 07:41.400]  that's already going on for decades, that would be an alien on this planet.
[07:41.400 --> 07:44.680]  So if it's aliens running this, I don't know.
[07:44.680 --> 07:50.000]  But the globalists setting this plan up are anti-human and say humans are obsolete whether
[07:50.000 --> 07:56.680]  it's Uri or Klaus Schwab or Bill Gates and they're involved in a revolution or an update
[07:56.680 --> 08:00.440]  where you don't just get rid of your last phone, your last computer or your last garage
[08:00.440 --> 08:06.080]  door opener, you get rid of humans themselves and that's the anti-human revolution that's
[08:06.080 --> 08:11.320]  happening with their carbon taxes, with their global surveillance, with their quote great
[08:11.320 --> 08:17.720]  reset to build back better, there'll be no humans as we have known ourselves at the end
[08:17.720 --> 08:18.720]  of this revolution.
[08:18.720 --> 08:22.240]  That's all been announced in the Wall Street Journal in the New York Times looking forward
[08:22.240 --> 08:25.240]  to the end of humanity.
[08:25.240 --> 08:31.520]  Now the Bible tells us it's a fallen entity manipulating us here on this planet to set
[08:31.520 --> 08:36.160]  up a world government, make us have a digital mark of the beast to buy and sell and then
[08:36.160 --> 08:39.120]  we'll have to give up our humanity in the process and give up our free will and our
[08:39.120 --> 08:40.120]  soul.
[08:40.120 --> 08:44.320]  That was said 2,000 years ago by John the Rebelator on the Isle of Patmos and it was
[08:44.320 --> 08:48.520]  also stated in Ezekiel in the Old Testament and Daniel.
[08:48.520 --> 08:57.440]  And so you can look at it any way you want but the global social engineers, futurists,
[08:57.440 --> 09:06.320]  are following revelation to a T. Absolutely following it to a T. And so whether it's saying
[09:06.320 --> 09:13.000]  a man can have a baby or two women can have a baby when it's a man and a woman in a prison
[09:13.000 --> 09:19.120]  or the left saying, hey, love is love, let three-year-olds date 20-year-olds.
[09:19.120 --> 09:23.240]  All of this is about getting you to go against your own common sense and the programming
[09:23.240 --> 09:27.720]  God gave you and follow destructive practices known as sin.
[09:27.720 --> 09:32.460]  And you think of sin as cheating on your wife or drinking too much alcohol or cheating
[09:32.460 --> 09:35.840]  on your taxes but that's low level stuff.
[09:35.840 --> 09:42.760]  Real sin is going against your human code that God gave you and that's where we are.
[09:42.760 --> 09:48.200]  For the 20 states have passed laws to use dead bodies for fuel and dead bodies for fertilizer
[09:48.200 --> 09:52.400]  all sponsored by the U.N. and Bill Gates.
[09:52.400 --> 09:53.960]  They're coming out with these gene therapies.
[09:53.960 --> 09:54.960]  They're forcing on us.
[09:54.960 --> 10:00.560]  Now the FDA says, hey, we're just going to go ahead and authorize all these new shots
[10:00.560 --> 10:02.680]  with no trials.
[10:02.680 --> 10:07.360]  That's a revolution against you because they're not just offering unproven dangerous things.
[10:07.360 --> 10:12.280]  They're saying you got to take it.
[10:12.280 --> 10:17.160]  So that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen, and the list of tyrannies and attacks on humanities
[10:17.160 --> 10:18.160]  goes on and on.
[10:18.160 --> 10:21.240]  I'm going to talk about it more in the next segment, but first I want to air a new report
[10:21.240 --> 10:22.840]  that just came out on Saturday.
[10:22.840 --> 10:24.640]  The report's live at Band-Aid video.
[10:24.640 --> 10:27.760]  We'll post it today under the live show feed.
[10:27.760 --> 10:35.400]  And that's Greg Rees' latest report, AI Factory, to process 5,000 tons of meat per day delivered
[10:35.400 --> 10:36.600]  via trains.
[10:36.600 --> 10:39.960]  There's something a lot bigger than this.
[10:39.960 --> 10:44.200]  And Greg Rees foreshadows that and hints at a very important report.
[10:44.200 --> 10:45.840]  It's at Band-Aid video.
[10:45.840 --> 10:55.040]  Here is that report.
[10:55.040 --> 11:01.480]  While 80% of the world's population continues on with oil and gas, the United States and
[11:01.480 --> 11:07.680]  a small handful of Western nations have decided to go green, even if it kills everyone.
[11:07.680 --> 11:13.640]  They have already admitted that the disruptive economic burden this will cause is exactly
[11:13.640 --> 11:21.100]  the sort of pressure required to inspire the innovation needed to make it all work someday.
[11:21.100 --> 11:22.400]  Because that's the plan.
[11:22.400 --> 11:26.120]  There are no viable solutions to replace oil and gas.
[11:26.120 --> 11:31.400]  So the sooner we can figure it out, the sooner we can stop the endless rise of inflation,
[11:31.400 --> 11:37.880]  starvation and death that will obviously result from shutting off our energy taps.
[11:37.880 --> 11:44.520]  And a new company has already appeared, albeit with a bizarre solution to our problems.
[11:44.520 --> 11:51.200]  A massive meat rendering facility is set to break ground next year in Rapid City, South
[11:51.200 --> 11:55.800]  Dakota and be completed by 2026.
[11:55.800 --> 12:01.480]  With the ordinary name the Western Legacy Development Corporation, one might never guess
[12:01.480 --> 12:05.280]  how innovative this company actually is.
[12:05.280 --> 12:09.960]  The Western Legacy Development Corporation will process cattle and bison completely with
[12:09.960 --> 12:16.680]  robotics and artificial intelligence, including new laser technology air knives that use a
[12:16.680 --> 12:21.240]  high velocity airstream to de-hide the animals.
[12:21.240 --> 12:26.400]  The Western Legacy Development Corporation is building a massive one million square
[12:26.400 --> 12:33.000]  foot meat factory that will be operating at levels as high as 8,000 cattle per day.
[12:33.000 --> 12:39.160]  Now one might ask, what about all this social engineering to stop eating real beef and get
[12:39.160 --> 12:42.320]  used to eating lab grown meat and bugs?
[12:42.320 --> 12:46.480]  Aren't we being told that cow farts are bad for the environment?
[12:46.480 --> 12:51.760]  Well, as it turns out, the Western Legacy Development Corporation isn't necessarily
[12:51.760 --> 12:56.280]  going to be processing three million cattle per year for food.
[12:56.280 --> 13:01.400]  The Western Legacy Development Corporation will be collecting animal fat to be used as
[13:01.400 --> 13:07.800]  feed and fuel, a biofuel that they will use to power their very own one million square
[13:07.800 --> 13:09.640]  foot facility.
[13:09.640 --> 13:11.720]  Now how green is that?
[13:11.720 --> 13:18.880]  Well, maybe not small farm grass fed level green, but still, it's pretty green.
[13:18.880 --> 13:24.320]  Rapid City is a small town and many residents are asking, where will they get 8,000 cattle
[13:24.320 --> 13:31.200]  a day and where will they keep them and where will they get 2,500 employees, which is 3%
[13:31.200 --> 13:34.600]  of their population and where will they house them?
[13:34.600 --> 13:39.400]  These questions weren't really answered, but we do know that they plan to have a thriving
[13:39.400 --> 13:45.040]  rail system that will be offloading thousands of cattle each and every day, directly into
[13:45.040 --> 13:49.920]  the AI robot laser slaughterhouse for immediate processing.
[13:49.920 --> 13:52.440]  So they won't need to store the cattle anywhere.
[13:52.440 --> 13:57.480]  Now, while this may sound like some sort of crazy economist's solution to cleaning up
[13:57.480 --> 14:03.520]  a mass murder, or even some kind of soylent green scenario where the government is chopping
[14:03.520 --> 14:07.920]  up people in a factory for food, and in this case, energy.
[14:07.920 --> 14:11.600]  Silent green is people!
[14:11.600 --> 14:16.920]  We are told that it's all for the environment, so I'm sure it's all good.
[14:16.920 --> 14:21.520]  And hey, at least we won't be burning any more oil, like the rest of the world.
[14:21.520 --> 14:24.320]  And don't worry, trust the science.
[14:24.320 --> 14:25.320]  Russia.
[14:25.320 --> 14:27.240]  Russia, Russia, Russia.
[14:27.240 --> 14:28.920]  And remember the plan.
[14:28.920 --> 14:33.840]  Once we really start suffering, someone will eventually think of a solution.
[14:33.840 --> 14:40.960]  And if not, at least we were willing to die for a criminal government run by pedophiles.
[14:40.960 --> 14:44.200]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[14:44.200 --> 14:51.600]  So you see, it's very, very, very, very simple.
[14:51.600 --> 14:55.520]  They turn off society, they turn off the gas, the fuel, they declare there's going to be
[14:55.520 --> 15:00.000]  no more beef, no more eating meat, or going to eat bugs, and then as things collapse,
[15:00.000 --> 15:05.000]  they say, oh, do what we say, it'll get better, but really, it's a collapsed economy designed
[15:05.000 --> 15:09.160]  to feed all of us into it, and obviously, you can put two and two together.
[15:09.160 --> 15:13.000]  That facility is not for cows, ladies and gentlemen.
[15:13.000 --> 15:16.720]  All their actuaries, all their members talk about fueling the new economy on dead humans.
[15:16.720 --> 15:19.520]  Why are they going to have so many dead humans?
[15:19.520 --> 15:23.920]  Because they're going to release even more deadly bio weapons in the very near future.
[15:23.920 --> 15:26.760]  Now, I told you that 10 years ago, and I did, you'd roll your eyes.
[15:26.760 --> 15:31.480]  The day you don't roll your eyes, because you know, these are psychotic predators who
[15:31.480 --> 15:34.000]  are making their move on all of us.
[15:34.000 --> 15:39.080]  We're going to be laying more information out on this front, and the design control
[15:39.080 --> 15:46.320]  collapsed the economy and how to stop it straight ahead on this special Sunday, July 4th, Eve,
[15:46.320 --> 15:47.800]  Worldwide Emergency Broadcast.
[15:47.800 --> 15:54.360]  I hope you share that video by Greg Rees from band.video, or you can just submit and roll
[15:54.360 --> 15:55.360]  over and die.
[15:55.360 --> 16:00.320]  I know you want to fight back like I do.

[19:10.480 --> 19:12.680]  food to get packaged and delivered to you.

[19:16.920 --> 19:19.240]  quality food ready to ship.

[19:31.640 --> 19:35.720]  With the inflation happening, with the food shortages, with the wars, with the collapse
[19:35.720 --> 19:39.280]  in wars, everything's happening, is one of the most important things you can make is
[19:39.280 --> 19:43.160]  to have high quality, storeable food, water filtration, air filtration and more, and it's
[19:43.160 --> 19:47.160]  not just those items, it's hundreds of other high quality, preparedness items and survival
[19:47.160 --> 19:53.760]  items right now at PrepareWithAlex.com that again redirects to PrepareToday.com.
[19:53.760 --> 19:56.720]  I would not procrastinate, ladies and gentlemen, one of the most important things you can do
[19:56.720 --> 20:00.960]  is get ahead of inflation now because the inflation is just beginning.
[20:00.960 --> 20:20.160]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:20.160 --> 20:32.160]  Teaching war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[20:32.160 --> 20:37.200]  The New World Order submission going up against God and humanity is the impossible mission.
[20:37.200 --> 20:40.800]  They may have stolen control of the banks and the currency, they may have quadrillions
[20:40.800 --> 20:45.800]  and fake money to try to destroy the economy and transfer us over the transhumans agenda
[20:45.800 --> 20:58.640]  but they will fail in the end because we have been given Providence divine discernment at
[20:58.640 --> 21:00.720]  a divine mission.
[21:00.720 --> 21:05.560]  Our mission is guaranteed, the only question is who will join the mission and come in for
[21:05.560 --> 21:06.560]  the big win.
[21:06.560 --> 21:12.760]  All right, let's go over this stack that just ties into the last horrific report about a
[21:12.760 --> 21:21.040]  facility to cut up mammals that turned them into biofuel.
[21:21.040 --> 21:27.000]  Now what fuel cost, you will never be able in the actuary to actually fund a facility
[21:27.000 --> 21:28.280]  like that.
[21:28.280 --> 21:31.480]  So it's only done when you've cut off all the other energy and that's the only energy
[21:31.480 --> 21:38.040]  you're allowing and all the laws are being passed were to be humans in that facility.
[21:38.040 --> 21:43.160]  Your salon with the power plants of the future burn dead bodies, see when I tell you I see
[21:43.160 --> 21:46.680]  something I know what's going to happen with it, I've got thousands of data points and
[21:46.680 --> 21:53.080]  decades of research behind it but you don't need me to tell you.
[21:53.080 --> 21:55.080]  You see right there what that is, don't you?
[21:55.080 --> 22:03.480]  It's not going to be cows, ladies and gentlemen, it's going to be dead people and I'm sure
[22:03.480 --> 22:06.480]  some will arrive alive.
[22:06.480 --> 22:13.480]  One mother convicted after 18 month old son died from a zero meat diet, yeah folks we're
[22:13.480 --> 22:23.240]  supposed to eat meat, we're omnivores, AI run factory to process 5,000 tons of meat
[22:23.240 --> 22:31.000]  per day delivered via trains, Biden blocks offshore drilling limiting oil production
[22:31.000 --> 22:37.080]  for begging old companies to produce more and attacking gas stations.
[22:37.080 --> 22:42.280]  And Biden in the clip we played last segment copied Trump but Trump said as a joke, Russia,
[22:42.280 --> 22:46.800]  Russia, Russia, that's why they cut off the pipelines, Putin did that, that's who cut
[22:46.800 --> 22:50.560]  off the drilling permits, Putin did that, that's who shut down drilling in the Gulf
[22:50.560 --> 22:54.680]  of Mexico and Anwar, Alaska, Putin did that.
[22:54.680 --> 23:03.600]  Of course 30 seconds of research will show you that's a complete fraud but he says it's
[23:03.600 --> 23:08.000]  all Putin and he said while we're busy on this transition to green energy so he tells
[23:08.000 --> 23:13.400]  you we're doing this to you for green energy, really for power and control but it's also
[23:13.400 --> 23:22.480]  Putin's fault, oxymoronic lies, gaslighting, never before seen levels but the good news
[23:22.480 --> 23:29.320]  is the Supreme Court cut back the deep state bureaucracy at the EPA with a ruling on Thursday
[23:29.320 --> 23:33.000]  saying you just can't make your own laws and shut off all our coal power plants and
[23:33.000 --> 23:38.520]  bankrupt the nation especially when India and China and Mexico and 160 other countries
[23:38.520 --> 23:43.400]  plus are making zero cuts in their emissions.
[23:43.400 --> 23:47.920]  Carbon's good in our atmosphere, it's a trace gas carbon dioxide, it's what the planet
[23:47.920 --> 23:52.760]  lives off of, you can get plants 3-4 times the carbon dioxide and they grow 3-4 times
[23:52.760 --> 23:58.200]  faster and more healthy and put out more oxygen, why are they attacking the atmosphere, cow's
[23:58.200 --> 24:03.440]  methane is part of the atmosphere, our methane is part of the atmosphere, if you can tax
[24:03.440 --> 24:08.840]  a cow or ban a cow because it farts what is it saying about a human, this is an attack
[24:08.840 --> 24:14.920]  on life and the life system on this planet, it's like the joke of space balls where they
[24:14.920 --> 24:19.600]  have a tax on air.
[24:19.600 --> 24:25.440]  The worst stock market sell off is half a century might not be done yet, Yahoo Finance,
[24:25.440 --> 24:33.200]  China on track for contagious crash within weeks, throw deflation for whole world, Texas
[24:33.200 --> 24:36.800]  power used to break records next week during heat wave, they say there may be power out
[24:36.800 --> 24:44.360]  of this because they can't use coal and it goes on and on and on, nearly 8,000 flights
[24:44.360 --> 24:58.600]  delayed on Friday as July 4th weekend to be held, the collapse of civilization by design,
[24:58.600 --> 25:06.760]  that is what we are witnessing in real time.
[25:06.760 --> 25:12.040]  And then I've got all this news, you know we have an archivist and there's no use to
[25:12.040 --> 25:16.560]  it in our horn or by no if we covered this in Osium, I said last year and early this
[25:16.560 --> 25:22.480]  year the pre-programming I saw in the media, the truck that overturned in Pennsylvania with
[25:22.480 --> 25:29.360]  the monkeypox and the smallpox found in the Merck lab and all the pre-programming, I said
[25:29.360 --> 25:33.160]  the next thing they're going to launch is monkeypox because I saw that Bill Gates is
[25:33.160 --> 25:39.760]  profiting from it and had hundreds of millions of smallpox, monkeypox vaccines being made
[25:39.760 --> 25:43.640]  two years ago, I mean it's not hard to go, well he's the guy that ran all this stuff
[25:43.640 --> 25:48.160]  before, he's about to do it and I didn't just say it once it happened, I called it
[25:48.160 --> 25:55.680]  before it happened and just like clockwork, it happened and now all over the US and New
[25:55.680 --> 26:04.840]  York and California and everywhere they're saying we need new lockdowns because monkeypox
[26:04.840 --> 26:10.240]  hasn't killed anybody, a few thousand cases worldwide, vaccine injury in the studies
[26:10.240 --> 26:15.520]  is exactly like from this COVID shot, the sign of the vaccine is exactly like monkeypox
[26:15.520 --> 26:21.480]  but never mind that, we've got 500 some cases worldwide, we've got to start locking down
[26:21.480 --> 26:27.320]  again and teaching you to live under martial law, World Health Organization issues fresh
[26:27.320 --> 26:35.920]  warning over monkeypox, that's a story on Infowars.com by RT, that's right and you've
[26:35.920 --> 26:43.840]  got this Tapos San Diego tweet, I have lived to see man-made horrors beyond my imagination,
[26:43.840 --> 26:50.600]  a baby, if you're a radio listener don't describe it, with a blue surgical mask over
[26:50.600 --> 26:56.480]  its face and eyes with two holes cut out so they can see, hey why not just put a pillow
[26:56.480 --> 27:03.120]  over your baby's face, but that's the cult of these idiots, the Fauci funded Peter Dazik
[27:03.120 --> 27:07.720]  is now working with Kremlin back researchers isolating new coronavirus strains, yeah they're
[27:07.720 --> 27:13.080]  all just mercenaries, now he's working for the Russians and Biden says there's going
[27:13.080 --> 27:18.920]  to be another pandemic, boy wasn't Dr. Vladimir Zelinko right, passed away on Thursday, we
[27:18.920 --> 27:24.840]  love you Dr. Zelinko, who says, that's the UN monkeypox cases triple in Europe in two
[27:24.840 --> 27:32.000]  weeks, urgent action needed to contain the spread, a warning to anyone attending mass
[27:32.000 --> 27:36.440]  gatherings over the weekend, monkeypox threatened the UK, don't kill it, oh don't go out, they're
[27:36.440 --> 27:43.520]  getting you ready just like in 2020 for the next lockdown, for now wear a US, Treadswater
[27:43.520 --> 27:49.200]  with Transform COVID-19, new strains AP reports, it's going to kill you any minute, the ultra
[27:49.200 --> 27:55.080]  contagious Omnicron variants, BA4, BA5 fueling California coronavirus wave and they need
[27:55.080 --> 28:05.200]  new lockdowns, says Governor Newsom right on time, unbelievable, and they're talking about
[28:05.200 --> 28:10.120]  civil war, they're talking about dictatorship, Biden's saving us mainstream news, using executive
[28:10.120 --> 28:14.680]  orders, yahoo news, that's coming up next, save us Biden, be a dictator, well he's already
[28:14.680 --> 28:19.480]  a dictator, he stole the election, but if I was you, I'd spread the word about the broadcast
[28:19.480 --> 28:23.720]  more than ever, people are ready to learn, ready to wake up, and I'd get prepared, we

[29:41.000 --> 29:44.560]  America, and I would encourage you to join the fight even harder now, because we're so
[29:44.560 --> 29:52.760]  close to winning, infowarstore.com, and celebrate July 4th, 1776, part two, against the new
[29:52.760 --> 29:57.760]  world order, because the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[29:57.760 --> 30:06.480]  So I did it, I signed up for the Austin Marathon, I've been training, probably not as much
[30:06.480 --> 30:12.080]  as I should be, but thank goodness for prayer, and thank goodness for infowarstore.com, before
[30:12.080 --> 30:17.240]  I set out on a run, I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need to get
[30:17.240 --> 30:22.880]  going, besides the energy turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins I need, like vitamin
[30:22.880 --> 30:27.680]  C, to keep me healthy, and the essential B vitamins, plus the amino acids for sustained
[30:27.680 --> 30:31.280]  energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[30:31.280 --> 30:37.480]  And then every day now, I'm taking Dr. Jones' Sorilis, I have bad joints, thanks mom, so
[30:37.480 --> 30:41.880]  this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now, plus inflammation
[30:41.880 --> 30:44.280]  support and extra flexibility.
[30:44.280 --> 30:48.840]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast, so I can get back to the training.
[30:48.840 --> 30:53.520]  And if you're not crazy enough to take out a marathon, good news, turbo force, that can
[30:53.520 --> 30:57.640]  still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day, and Sorilis can keep you
[30:57.640 --> 30:59.920]  moving and feeling great at any age.
[30:59.920 --> 31:04.840]  A lot of listeners have told us it's hard to find out of the thousands of great items
[31:04.840 --> 31:07.480]  at m4store.com, all the storeable food.
[31:07.480 --> 31:11.440]  So we've made it easy with our great partners that supply us with the highest quality storeable
[31:11.440 --> 31:14.960]  food out there at the lowest price you're going to find for good food.
[31:14.960 --> 31:17.440]  Prepare to day.com.
[31:17.440 --> 31:21.960]  Go to preparetoday.com and protect yourself and your family with what's coming and what
[31:21.960 --> 31:24.480]  is already unfolding with global food shortages.
[31:24.480 --> 31:28.800]  I told you over two years ago, the global is going to have massive inflation and food
[31:28.800 --> 31:31.920]  shortages and it's happened just like clockwork.
[31:31.920 --> 31:35.640]  And I'm telling you, it's going to get a lot worse, they have designed this.
[31:35.640 --> 31:41.200]  The way to beat them is to buy food now before your dollar is even more devalued.
[31:41.200 --> 31:46.880]  We're ready to ship to you right now at preparetoday.com and not just storeable food, hundreds
[31:46.880 --> 31:52.120]  of the highest quality, survival and preparedness items in stock at low prices ready to ship

[31:58.760 --> 31:59.760]  Take action.
[31:59.760 --> 32:04.440]  The National Dissues is a new film, 2000 Mules is the most important documentary in modern
[32:04.440 --> 32:09.240]  times because it proves how the deep state stole the 2020 election and how they're planning

[33:01.200 --> 33:14.680]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:14.680 --> 33:22.000]  Sunday, July 30th, and we are broadcasting worldwide.
[33:22.000 --> 33:28.200]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[33:28.200 --> 33:34.720]  Remember, powerful forces of evil are working around their clock to ensure this broadcast
[33:34.720 --> 33:42.240]  is not heard, but we, the people, are rising and the power of you, the activist audience
[33:42.240 --> 33:47.440]  is unstoppable with God's aid when you decide to take action.
[33:47.440 --> 33:52.360]  So pray for God to lead God and direct you and to give you the foresight of the discernment
[33:52.360 --> 33:58.800]  to take this information to the four corners of the earth.
[33:58.800 --> 34:00.000]  All right, here it is.
[34:00.000 --> 34:07.040]  So we have national polls put out by mainline pollsters that always oversample at least 15%
[34:07.040 --> 34:12.200]  more Democrat as they claim to country democratic, democratic party crime syndicate.
[34:12.200 --> 34:17.520]  And then national polls, depending on the poll, between 70 and 80% of people don't want
[34:17.520 --> 34:21.760]  Biden to run again and don't like Biden.
[34:21.760 --> 34:26.680]  Here's another one out of the hill, 71% don't want Biden to run for reelection.
[34:26.680 --> 34:31.200]  I thought he just won with even 9 million more votes than Obama.
[34:31.200 --> 34:34.120]  I mean, I never said Obama stole the elections.
[34:34.120 --> 34:35.720]  Obama won those elections.
[34:35.720 --> 34:39.920]  He ran against the ringers of John McCain and Mitt Romney, and he was popular at least
[34:39.920 --> 34:40.920]  the first time.
[34:40.920 --> 34:41.920]  He won.
[34:41.920 --> 34:43.520]  The evidence is there.
[34:43.520 --> 34:47.880]  But he's in his third administration now fraudulently through this puppet.
[34:47.880 --> 34:49.880]  This is the third Obama administration.
[34:49.880 --> 34:54.400]  I know you all know that, but we need to get that information out to everybody.
[34:54.400 --> 34:59.160]  And so I see articles in the Washington Post, Yahoo, New York Times, everywhere, Biden needs
[34:59.160 --> 35:00.760]  to act with executive power.
[35:00.760 --> 35:04.920]  Well, he's already doing it, shutting down the pipelines and the oil drilling and ordering
[35:04.920 --> 35:08.240]  the border wide open and continuing the devaluation of the dollar.
[35:08.240 --> 35:10.720]  I mean, he's already doing that executive.
[35:10.720 --> 35:17.320]  And so they're saying be dictatorial, override the courts, override the Congress, override
[35:17.320 --> 35:20.400]  the governors, do it all.
[35:20.400 --> 35:26.640]  Here's Yahoo News, pressure builds on Biden to turn to executive action, despite its limits
[35:26.640 --> 35:27.640]  and risk.
[35:27.640 --> 35:30.840]  The article goes on to say he's got inflation.
[35:30.840 --> 35:32.720]  He's got recession, domestic agenda.
[35:32.720 --> 35:33.720]  He's got abortion.
[35:33.720 --> 35:35.840]  He's got to do it right now.
[35:35.840 --> 35:40.640]  Meanwhile, Biden administration signs five year contract to house migrant children.
[35:40.640 --> 35:47.560]  Many of them smuggled and kidnapped at North Carolina School, 14,000 of them, that God
[35:47.560 --> 35:57.160]  knows what the global esteem state is going to be doing with all of those people.
[35:57.160 --> 36:03.360]  So that's where we are with them cutting off the infrastructure, them cutting our nation
[36:03.360 --> 36:04.360]  off.
[36:04.360 --> 36:10.120]  This is nothing less than economic war.
[36:10.120 --> 36:15.800]  Let me address this right now because I don't like to get predictions wrong.
[36:15.800 --> 36:20.760]  And I rarely do get predictions wrong, but Alex Jones is not always right.
[36:20.760 --> 36:26.800]  Alex Jones was right is a more accurate statement.
[36:26.800 --> 36:28.680]  Roger Stone is very close friends with Trump.
[36:28.680 --> 36:30.480]  That's not a secret.
[36:30.480 --> 36:41.120]  And on the show a few days ago, weekday show, Roger said that he expects Trump to declare
[36:41.120 --> 36:43.640]  in July.
[36:43.640 --> 36:45.480]  Then I talked to Roger off air and leave it at that.
[36:45.480 --> 36:51.000]  I made some other phone calls and Trump as of last week was saying, I think I'll announce
[36:51.000 --> 36:52.000]  July 4th.
[36:52.000 --> 36:58.240]  Now, they call it tactical flexibility doesn't mean he will, but it's a political attack
[36:58.240 --> 36:59.680]  to shut him down.
[36:59.680 --> 37:03.520]  Once he declares, that'll make him harder with fake indictments and things of that nature.
[37:03.520 --> 37:11.520]  So it ended up being ABC News, NBC News, Blunt and Guardian, I mean everywhere, Alex Jones
[37:11.520 --> 37:13.200]  says Trump will declare July 4th.
[37:13.200 --> 37:19.040]  I did not say that, but they'll say if he doesn't declare on Monday, Jones is wrong
[37:19.040 --> 37:20.040]  again.
[37:20.040 --> 37:23.360]  Jones said Trump would declare, but they won't show you a video.
[37:23.360 --> 37:28.480]  They'll show you some edited text of what I said.
[37:28.480 --> 37:35.600]  But everybody saw the show, everybody heard it, and they saw what I said on Friday.
[37:35.600 --> 37:37.400]  They saw what Roger said on Friday.
[37:37.400 --> 37:44.880]  The video of it is on Band-Aid video where I said Trump is currently saying he looks
[37:44.880 --> 37:46.680]  to declare on July 4th.
[37:46.680 --> 37:51.480]  We don't know that's going to happen, but here it is breaking conspiracy theorist Alex
[37:51.480 --> 37:56.360]  Jones claims that Donald Trump plans to announce a run for 24 White House on July 4th.
[37:56.360 --> 38:01.440]  RT, if you've never voted for Trump, there's a bunch of headlines.
[38:01.440 --> 38:09.160]  Trump eyes early 2024 announcement, the January 6th scrutiny intensifies.
[38:09.160 --> 38:14.800]  So that's the type of stuff that we're dealing with here.
[38:14.800 --> 38:18.360]  And that's how they're going to try to spin this and control this.
[38:18.360 --> 38:22.760]  But obviously they're going after Trump because they're worried he's going to run, and they're
[38:22.760 --> 38:29.200]  messing with him and attacking him and doing all this is what will probably trigger or
[38:29.200 --> 38:35.360]  launch or precipitate him actually doing that.
[38:35.360 --> 38:37.080]  And I got mixed feelings about that.
[38:37.080 --> 38:40.000]  I'm mad at him about the poison vaccine and a lot of other stuff, but I'm glad about
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.840]  Roe v. Wade and the border and standing up at China.
[38:42.840 --> 38:44.480]  And so it's a mixed bag.
[38:44.480 --> 38:45.880]  But hey, we're not a cult here.
[38:45.880 --> 38:48.520]  We're not mad at listeners if you're angry at Trump.
[38:48.520 --> 38:51.440]  We're not mad at listeners if you love Trump.
[38:51.440 --> 38:55.680]  He certainly means well, I don't think he's a bad person.
[38:55.680 --> 38:58.320]  People say, don't trust Ron DeSantis, will I go off a tree's fruits?
[38:58.320 --> 39:00.200]  I really like DeSantis.
[39:00.200 --> 39:04.480]  But we can't just count on a Ron DeSantis or a Donald Trump to save us.
[39:04.480 --> 39:06.720]  We have to be engaged.
[39:06.720 --> 39:08.280]  We have to be involved.
[39:08.280 --> 39:09.760]  And we have to know the issues.
[39:09.760 --> 39:14.280]  And we have to say no to the people really running things, the global corporate system,
[39:14.280 --> 39:21.840]  a la Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, the New World Order, Black Rock, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs.
[39:21.840 --> 39:27.760]  So that's that's where we are right now in this country and in this world.
[39:27.760 --> 39:34.200]  Now, Bolsonaro, I have said clearly is better than Victor Orban.
[39:34.200 --> 39:37.960]  He's better than Donald Trump and he's better than Ron DeSantis.
[39:37.960 --> 39:44.240]  If you want somebody who takes on the New World Order and that tells it like it is to
[39:44.240 --> 39:48.080]  his people and calls out the whole damn thing, it's Bolsonaro.
[39:48.080 --> 39:49.080]  And I am so honored.
[39:49.080 --> 39:50.080]  He's a listener.
[39:50.080 --> 39:52.080]  So honored to meet his son that's a member of their Congress.
[39:52.080 --> 39:54.800]  They invited me down there two years ago to interview him.
[39:54.800 --> 39:57.760]  And I'm so tied down here with fights and everything and also money.
[39:57.760 --> 40:01.640]  I don't have money to have three, four security I got to have and to get down to Brazil and
[40:01.640 --> 40:02.640]  do that.
[40:02.640 --> 40:03.640]  I mean, I probably should have done it.
[40:03.640 --> 40:06.080]  I'm an adventurer, but I'm so tied down.
[40:06.080 --> 40:09.880]  I can do so much here at the Info Wars Command Base that if we weren't trying to write the
[40:09.880 --> 40:12.520]  ship and keep the ship from going down, I would have been down there.
[40:12.520 --> 40:17.920]  But I'm glad that Tucker Carlson accepted the invitation this whole week and knocked
[40:17.920 --> 40:19.120]  it out of the parks.
[40:19.120 --> 40:21.360]  We have one of those big interviews.
[40:21.360 --> 40:23.440]  He's done down there coming up next segment.
[40:23.440 --> 40:26.960]  And we've got so much more into the second hour tonight.
[40:26.960 --> 40:29.000]  But let me just throw this out at you.
[40:29.000 --> 40:30.440]  I need your help to stay on there.
[40:30.440 --> 40:34.360]  And I try to bring you things that I know you need and that I personally have bought
[40:34.360 --> 40:35.360]  and things I've used.
[40:35.360 --> 40:39.760]  I only give you advice that I believe is the very best there is my perfect.
[40:39.760 --> 40:42.360]  No, but let me say something.
[40:42.360 --> 40:44.520]  You are insane.
[40:44.520 --> 40:48.960]  If you don't buy high quality, horrible food that's ready to ship to you and your family,
[40:48.960 --> 40:54.720]  as I told people 30 months ago to do and now food prices have doubled on average, our suppliers
[40:54.720 --> 40:56.760]  only gone up 20%.
[40:56.760 --> 40:58.120]  But they will go up in prices soon.
[40:58.120 --> 41:02.440]  If you go to prepare today.com, it's the entire my Patrick catalog and live time.
[41:02.440 --> 41:03.440]  They're back in that way.
[41:03.440 --> 41:04.840]  It gets even quicker.
[41:04.840 --> 41:09.920]  You make your order and we get 20 to 40% because there's not much markup in this.
[41:09.920 --> 41:11.240]  The average is about 30%.
[41:11.240 --> 41:14.360]  We split the profit that's there and be able to run our operations.
[41:14.360 --> 41:18.920]  Not even profit, it's just the gross to be able to run the operation.
[41:18.920 --> 41:20.840]  So go to prepare today.com.
[41:20.840 --> 41:25.560]  They have the full spectrum with the lowest prices, hundreds of survival goods, air filters,
[41:25.560 --> 41:29.120]  water filters, highest quality, horrible food, ready to ship.

[41:38.800 --> 41:39.800]  right now.
[41:39.800 --> 41:42.720]  Again, for almost four months, did I promote swarble food?
[41:42.720 --> 41:44.440]  Didn't have a swarble food sponsor.
[41:44.440 --> 41:46.520]  Our main sponsor was behind.
[41:46.520 --> 41:47.520]  They bought a ton of food.
[41:47.520 --> 41:48.520]  It's ready at shipping.
[41:48.520 --> 41:51.720]  So they said, hey, we're a few weeks behind, might want to back off.
[41:51.720 --> 41:53.200]  We want people to get it right away.
[41:53.200 --> 41:57.720]  But the food's there and they're ready to ship right now to you and your family.
[41:57.720 --> 42:00.840]  And then with inflation, it's only going to go up, ladies and gentlemen, you know you've
[42:00.840 --> 42:04.360]  got that food lock down that lasts more than a decade, it's high quality, nutritious, and

[47:01.280 --> 47:16.080]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:16.080 --> 47:24.200]  And we are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[47:24.200 --> 47:28.480]  So I've seen a meme going around everywhere, my text messages, my email box, Twitter, Facebook,
[47:28.480 --> 47:35.040]  everywhere without even looking, people say Gizlain Maxwell is convicted of trafficking
[47:35.040 --> 47:41.320]  thousands of children, little girls and women, but nobody's been charged for actually having
[47:41.320 --> 47:43.880]  sex with these children.
[47:43.880 --> 47:49.040]  So the good news is no matter what they try, this globalist black male operation is being
[47:49.040 --> 47:50.040]  exposed.
[47:50.040 --> 47:58.680]  I have a clip here of UFC middleweight champion Israel Adesaniah, I'm pronouncing that right,
[47:58.680 --> 47:59.680]  making this point.
[47:59.680 --> 48:00.680]  Here it is.
[48:00.680 --> 48:04.920]  Gailin Maxwell just got put away for 20 years.
[48:04.920 --> 48:09.400]  So she was supplying kids for these pedos, right?
[48:09.400 --> 48:10.400]  Where's the list?
[48:10.400 --> 48:15.680]  Is it, is that just gets like, I don't know, weird that that got no coverage, but Johnny
[48:15.680 --> 48:20.560]  Depp and I know it's everywhere, yeah, and I'm like, so the list of, you know, politicians
[48:20.560 --> 48:24.680]  and actresses and actors or whatever that they talked about, does that get swept under
[48:24.680 --> 48:25.680]  the rug?
[48:25.680 --> 48:28.680]  Do they not get any time for actually those kids?
[48:28.680 --> 48:29.680]  You know what I mean?
[48:29.680 --> 48:30.680]  Like, I don't know.
[48:30.680 --> 48:33.600]  Like, that's weird that how that just doesn't compute with me.
[48:33.600 --> 48:40.320]  You have Steve Jobs, wife, his heir that runs the Atlantic magazine, literally basically
[48:40.320 --> 48:45.000]  living at the compound with Gizlain Maxwell, photographed all of it.
[48:45.000 --> 48:50.480]  And see, that's how they blackmail the ruling global elite is they were all part of this.
[48:50.480 --> 48:52.440]  That's why this continues to roll on.
[48:52.440 --> 48:53.880]  But let's have some fun here.
[48:53.880 --> 48:58.920]  Folks made the joke that, Stephen Crowder made the joke that Jen Psaki is on the loose.
[48:58.920 --> 49:04.960]  This was probably a stage video on the New York subway, but a midget dressed up as Chucky
[49:04.960 --> 49:07.840]  running around attacking people.
[49:07.840 --> 49:10.000]  So there you go.
[49:10.000 --> 49:18.040]  Again, radio listeners are not being treated to this, but this Chucky attacking people
[49:18.040 --> 49:21.160]  on the New York subway.
[49:21.160 --> 49:27.000]  But let me show you here in a moment what is really scary that's going on.
[49:27.000 --> 49:34.080]  Here is Pope New World Order Francis with Pelosi in the joke says by Zade Smith, someone
[49:34.080 --> 49:40.200]  said this is a picture of the devil and the mafia.
[49:40.200 --> 49:43.600]  Meanwhile, this is Ross Ulbricht.
[49:43.600 --> 49:45.840]  He founded the website Silk Road.
[49:45.840 --> 49:47.960]  He was given two life sentences plus 40 years.
[49:47.960 --> 49:52.280]  Gizlain Maxwell was given 20 years for his text, traffic and kidnap children to politicians
[49:52.280 --> 49:53.280]  and celebrities.
[49:53.280 --> 49:57.760]  They should tell you everything you need to know about the government.
[49:57.760 --> 50:02.800]  And meanwhile, I followed her account before Isabella Maria DeLuca tweeted out, I will
[50:02.800 --> 50:06.720]  get married, I will own a farm and I will homeschool my future children.
[50:06.720 --> 50:11.640]  She was fired from her job for making that pro human statement.
[50:11.640 --> 50:16.080]  All right, let's go ahead and go to this powerful interview with the president of Brazil and
[50:16.080 --> 50:17.080]  Tucker Carlson.
[50:17.080 --> 50:19.240]  We'll be back in hour number two.
[50:19.240 --> 50:25.600]  Why didn't you take the vaccine?
[50:25.600 --> 50:30.880]  When the virus actually hit strongly in March 2020, people began to seek out the vaccine,
[50:30.880 --> 50:32.880]  of course, against the virus.
[50:32.880 --> 50:39.040]  And I too, of course, sought a medication because we began to see cases surfacing, started
[50:39.040 --> 50:42.560]  seeing the number of cases begin to go up.
[50:42.560 --> 50:47.560]  Now someone who contracts the virus like I did, I mean, the vaccine doesn't really help.
[50:47.560 --> 50:52.720]  I mean, you don't take a vaccine if you have already been contaminated.
[50:52.720 --> 50:55.720]  The vaccine would be innocuous.
[50:55.720 --> 50:58.520]  You should rather take the medication.
[50:58.520 --> 51:01.280]  And in Brazil, of course, I studied the issue.
[51:01.280 --> 51:08.160]  I called other countries, including in sub-Saharan Africa and Brazilian doctors and physicians,
[51:08.160 --> 51:13.120]  because there were people out there who either did not catch the virus or when they did catch
[51:13.120 --> 51:18.560]  the virus, the virus was not strong enough to send them to the hospital or to kill them.
[51:18.560 --> 51:25.800]  And in Brazil, we saw the emergence of two medications that began to be used more widely.
[51:25.800 --> 51:30.640]  I myself took them when contaminated, but the global pressure all over the world from
[51:30.640 --> 51:35.400]  the media outlets and from the pharmaceutical companies, I mean, they were all against the
[51:35.400 --> 51:36.920]  early treatment.
[51:36.920 --> 51:39.560]  They actually focused on the vaccine.
[51:39.560 --> 51:45.880]  I read Pfizer's contract, and one of the clauses said, we shall take no responsibility whatsoever
[51:45.880 --> 51:49.240]  for any side effect arising from the vaccine.
[51:49.240 --> 51:53.960]  I became concerned about that, and Congress in Brazil decided to vote and pass a piece
[51:53.960 --> 51:59.760]  of legislation saying that Pfizer or any other pharmaceutical company would not take responsibility
[51:59.760 --> 52:03.480]  for any side effect arising from the vaccine.
[52:03.480 --> 52:08.520]  We also had information, including from the US FDA, that several side effects are likely
[52:08.520 --> 52:14.960]  to emerge this year or next year in the foreseeable future.
[52:14.960 --> 52:21.000]  So the concern, as mentioned by many doctors, was that people who were infected by the virus
[52:21.000 --> 52:24.600]  were already immune and did not have to take the vaccine.
[52:24.600 --> 52:28.720]  That was my case, and that's why I did not take the vaccine.
[52:28.720 --> 52:31.720]  But I did purchase vaccines for all Brazilians.
[52:31.720 --> 52:34.160]  I did not demand that people be vaccinated.
[52:34.160 --> 52:37.320]  I respected individual freedom.
[52:37.320 --> 52:42.800]  Each one was free to vaccinate or not, and I believe that about 20% of the Brazilian
[52:42.800 --> 52:47.160]  population decided not to take the vaccine.
[52:47.160 --> 52:51.600]  As I said before, maybe I was the only head of state in the world who did not accept restrictive
[52:51.600 --> 52:56.520]  measures or was against restrictive measures, and perhaps one of the few heads of state
[52:56.520 --> 53:01.240]  in the world who did not take the vaccine because I had already contracted the virus.
[53:01.240 --> 53:05.000]  The left was so worried about taking me out of office that they wanted me to take the
[53:05.000 --> 53:08.120]  vaccine, and I said, well, let me die.
[53:08.120 --> 53:12.600]  Just let me die, then, and choose my policy.
[53:12.600 --> 53:16.800]  In South America, we are the one country that best addressed the issue involving the need
[53:16.800 --> 53:19.040]  for vaccines.
[53:19.040 --> 53:25.040]  And we very properly and adequately equipped our hospitals with equipment and medications.
[53:25.040 --> 53:28.360]  And I believe we have pretty much turned the page there.
[53:28.360 --> 53:32.720]  And based on the studies that we have available outside of Brazil, many deaths could have
[53:32.720 --> 53:37.440]  been avoided had there not been so much pressure on the part of the mainstream media against
[53:37.440 --> 53:40.760]  early treatment.
[53:40.760 --> 53:45.760]  Early last year, I sent a team to Israel, a team of Brazilian experts to Israel to look
[53:45.760 --> 53:51.360]  into the nasal spray solution they had developed on an experimental basis.
[53:51.360 --> 53:57.200]  I was highly criticized, and we weren't able to make progress in that negotiation.
[53:57.200 --> 54:01.720]  Last month, a large Brazilian company published a news article indicating that nasal sprays
[54:01.720 --> 54:06.520]  are currently a very successful solution against COVID today.
[54:06.520 --> 54:11.160]  So you are technically allowed, of course, to take an experimental vaccine, which was
[54:11.160 --> 54:13.840]  the case in the past, but not the nasal spray?
[54:13.840 --> 54:18.240]  I think you're the only world leader to admit not taking the vaccine, that's for sure.
[54:18.240 --> 54:25.920]  Why would Pfizer or any pharma company have liability protection against the side effects
[54:25.920 --> 54:26.960]  of their own drugs?
[54:26.960 --> 54:32.120]  Why would your Congress allow them to have that?
[54:32.120 --> 54:34.360]  The population was appalled.
[54:34.360 --> 54:38.760]  They were desperate and afraid of the virus, especially the elderly population that also
[54:38.760 --> 54:44.080]  had some kind of disease or comorbidity, as a result of which Congress decided to pass
[54:44.080 --> 54:47.480]  a law to that effect.
[54:47.480 --> 54:54.160]  We regret it, really, because today in hindsight, you know, we see in studies, you know, conducted
[54:54.160 --> 54:58.440]  outside of Brazil that perhaps two-thirds of deaths could have been avoided in Brazil
[54:58.440 --> 54:59.440]  and in the world.
[54:59.440 --> 55:01.640]  I mean, take Sub-Saharan Africa.
[55:01.640 --> 55:06.920]  In Sub-Saharan Africa, they take Ivermectin to fight river blindness, as well as hydroxychloroquine
[55:06.920 --> 55:12.640]  to fight malaria, and because the number of deaths was very low and the HDI was pretty
[55:12.640 --> 55:19.080]  low, one of the lowest in the world, the natural conclusion was that those medications could
[55:19.080 --> 55:24.200]  somehow also help fight the virus and the effects thereof.
[55:24.200 --> 55:29.400]  We regret the pressure that took place, and perhaps due to the economic power of pharmaceutical
[55:29.400 --> 55:35.720]  companies, I mean, they went on and invested in vaccines, and today you see, you know,
[55:35.720 --> 55:40.920]  people who have taken the third, the fourth dose of the vaccine, and they still contract
[55:40.920 --> 55:45.000]  the virus and die.
[55:45.000 --> 55:50.280]  We have a lot of, say, stranded vaccines in Brazil, and Brazil, a considerable portion
[55:50.280 --> 55:53.840]  of the population, did not want to take the booster dose.
[55:53.840 --> 55:58.480]  I understand that to be their right, I support individual freedom.
[55:58.480 --> 56:04.000]  As I said before, we are sorry, we regret all the deaths, but I believe many deaths
[56:04.000 --> 56:07.680]  could have been avoided through early treatment.
[56:07.680 --> 56:12.520]  Much is said about lack of scientific evidence about those two medications for COVID.
[56:12.520 --> 56:13.520]  True.
[56:13.520 --> 56:18.440]  But they were useful for other things, I mean, very often drugs or medications are
[56:18.440 --> 56:20.000]  discovered by chance.
[56:20.000 --> 56:25.480]  During World War II, for example, due to a lack of medication, soldiers were given coconut
[56:25.480 --> 56:29.160]  water in their vein, and they survived.
[56:29.160 --> 56:34.440]  As I said before, very often medications are discovered out of accident, or, you know,
[56:34.440 --> 56:40.520]  sheer chance, including medications against or to treat sexual impotence, for example.
[56:40.520 --> 56:46.920]  Viagra, viagra, so we...
[56:46.920 --> 56:50.720]  Where do you think the COVID virus came from?
[56:50.720 --> 56:56.360]  Well, allegedly from a laboratory on the other side of the world, but no deep investigation
[56:56.360 --> 57:00.000]  or no in-depth investigation has been conducted.
[57:00.000 --> 57:04.160]  It would seem that COVID has proved to be of interest for many people in the world.
[57:04.160 --> 57:09.720]  Many heads of state ended up imposing their will, and they felt the taste of dictatorship.
[57:09.720 --> 57:14.400]  In Brazil, state governments felt the taste of acting as dictators by mandating that people
[57:14.400 --> 57:19.320]  should stay at home and shutting down shops and not allowing people to go to school if
[57:19.320 --> 57:21.320]  they had not been vaccinated.
[57:21.320 --> 57:23.560]  So they felt that power in their hands.
[57:23.560 --> 57:25.480]  They could do everything during COVID.
[57:25.480 --> 57:30.280]  And more importantly, when it came to the public wheel itself, I mean, many things could
[57:30.280 --> 57:35.600]  be purchased by governors and mayors, although many of them, or the vast majority are honest,
[57:35.600 --> 57:41.560]  they were nevertheless able to buy just about anything without much of a sense of responsibility.
[57:41.560 --> 57:46.080]  So that taste of not being accountable for your actions during COVID is something that
[57:46.080 --> 57:49.200]  flourished among many top officials in Brazil.
[57:49.200 --> 57:54.680]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or pump gas, or whether you're a farmer, a rancher,
[57:54.680 --> 57:59.840]  a doctor, a lawyer, or a millionaire, Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[57:59.840 --> 58:00.840]  You see it every year.
[58:00.840 --> 58:06.040]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[58:06.040 --> 58:11.840]  And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups,
[58:11.840 --> 58:15.240]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding
[58:15.240 --> 58:16.240]  this and knowing this.
[58:16.240 --> 58:21.840]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[58:21.840 --> 58:24.880]  to be able to do things tax wise.
[58:24.880 --> 58:27.400]  It's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of your money.
[58:27.400 --> 58:32.840]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.

[59:51.280 --> 1:00:05.360]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:05.360 --> 1:00:23.680]  All right, we're going deep down the rabbit hole on this rovie-laid decision, some of
[1:00:23.680 --> 1:00:27.880]  the other big decisions that just happened that are very good for the Second Amendment
[1:00:27.880 --> 1:00:32.080]  and the right of free speech, not just the right of children to not be butchered in their
[1:00:32.080 --> 1:00:38.160]  mother's wombs, and the pushback with one of the top experts, the founder and head of
[1:00:38.160 --> 1:00:43.720]  Live Sight News, to be joining us, but I wanted to go to another one of these compilations
[1:00:43.720 --> 1:00:45.760]  we've done, we've got probably two of them.
[1:00:45.760 --> 1:00:49.960]  We just played one from about four years ago, here's one from about a year ago or less that
[1:00:49.960 --> 1:00:53.880]  Rob Doe put together, and then we've got a new compilation by the hour of the stuff
[1:00:53.880 --> 1:00:57.600]  happening at the pedophile parades, that's what they are, they're not gay parades, they're
[1:00:57.600 --> 1:01:01.160]  pedophile parades, and so we're going to show that.
[1:01:01.160 --> 1:01:05.960]  These are celebrations of their war against innocent and this cult saying they're taking
[1:01:05.960 --> 1:01:10.240]  over our children and our lives, so that compilation is being put together from what happened over
[1:01:10.240 --> 1:01:13.320]  the weekend, it's coming up at the bottom of the hour, but first here's this report.
[1:01:13.320 --> 1:01:18.680]  We're going to have a great night tonight and for you people in Florida we're going
[1:01:18.680 --> 1:01:20.960]  to have a gay night.
[1:01:20.960 --> 1:01:21.960]  Gay!
[1:01:21.960 --> 1:01:22.960]  Gay!
[1:01:22.960 --> 1:01:23.960]  Gay!
[1:01:23.960 --> 1:01:24.960]  Gay!
[1:01:24.960 --> 1:01:25.960]  Gay!
[1:01:25.960 --> 1:01:26.960]  Gay!
[1:01:26.960 --> 1:01:27.960]  Gay!
[1:01:27.960 --> 1:01:28.960]  Gay!
[1:01:28.960 --> 1:01:29.960]  Gay!
[1:01:29.960 --> 1:01:30.960]  Gay!
[1:01:30.960 --> 1:01:37.960]  of our LGBTQIA community members, we want to make sure that Oregon is a safe, inclusive,
[1:01:37.960 --> 1:01:39.960]  and welcoming place for all.
[1:01:39.960 --> 1:01:49.960]  This is the most cringe thing I've ever seen.
[1:01:49.960 --> 1:01:51.960]  Holy psycho members.
[1:01:51.960 --> 1:01:54.960]  Literally obsessed with sex.
[1:01:54.960 --> 1:01:56.960]  That's what a part of our town is about.
[1:01:56.960 --> 1:01:58.960]  I mean, these people are just crazy.
[1:01:58.960 --> 1:02:00.960]  And they want access to your children.
[1:02:00.960 --> 1:02:02.960]  They got access to them.
[1:02:02.960 --> 1:02:04.960]  We sent them.
[1:02:04.960 --> 1:02:06.960]  We sent them.
[1:02:06.960 --> 1:02:08.960]  We sent them.
[1:02:08.960 --> 1:02:10.960]  We sent them.
[1:02:10.960 --> 1:02:12.960]  We sent them.
[1:02:12.960 --> 1:02:14.960]  We sent them.
[1:02:14.960 --> 1:02:16.960]  We sent them.
[1:02:16.960 --> 1:02:18.960]  We sent them.
[1:02:18.960 --> 1:02:20.960]  You think we're sinful?
[1:02:20.960 --> 1:02:22.960]  You fight against our rights.
[1:02:22.960 --> 1:02:24.960]  You say we all lead lives.
[1:02:24.960 --> 1:02:26.960]  You can't respect.
[1:02:26.960 --> 1:02:28.960]  We'll convert your children.
[1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:32.960]  Someone's got to teach them not to hate.
[1:02:32.960 --> 1:02:34.960]  We're coming.
[1:02:34.960 --> 1:02:36.960]  We are dreaming.
[1:02:36.960 --> 1:02:38.960]  Turns out a bunch of these people were convicted.
[1:02:38.960 --> 1:02:40.960]  Child rapists, of course.
[1:02:40.960 --> 1:02:42.960]  In the San Francisco Gay Choir.
[1:02:42.960 --> 1:02:44.960]  It's not a gay choir.
[1:02:44.960 --> 1:02:46.960]  It's a child rape organization.
[1:02:46.960 --> 1:02:48.960]  In my view.
[1:02:48.960 --> 1:02:52.960]  Child rape of their minds and their innocence.
[1:02:52.960 --> 1:02:54.960]  That's Austin right there.
[1:02:54.960 --> 1:02:56.960]  In naked, posing with children.
[1:02:56.960 --> 1:03:02.960]  Your children will work to convert all their sisters and brothers.
[1:03:02.960 --> 1:03:04.960]  And at the degeneration rate of this,
[1:03:04.960 --> 1:03:08.960]  they'll be raping children in the town square within one year.
[1:03:08.960 --> 1:03:10.960]  I'm happy about it.
[1:03:10.960 --> 1:03:12.960]  I'm excited.
[1:03:12.960 --> 1:03:14.960]  I'm getting me hugs and everything.
[1:03:14.960 --> 1:03:16.960]  I started young, right?
[1:03:16.960 --> 1:03:18.960]  Anyone can do that.
[1:03:18.960 --> 1:03:20.960]  Everyone can do that.
[1:03:20.960 --> 1:03:22.960]  Peace to children.
[1:03:22.960 --> 1:03:24.960]  Peace to children.
[1:03:24.960 --> 1:03:26.960]  But you don't have to worry.
[1:03:26.960 --> 1:03:28.960]  Because there's nothing wrong with standing by our side.
[1:03:28.960 --> 1:03:30.960]  Get on board and get on board.
[1:03:30.960 --> 1:03:32.960]  Drake, you should be at all ages.
[1:03:32.960 --> 1:03:34.960]  They can tell some people that they're left provocative.
[1:03:34.960 --> 1:03:36.960]  Get on board and get on board.
[1:03:36.960 --> 1:03:38.960]  Because there's nothing wrong with standing by our side.
[1:03:38.960 --> 1:03:40.960]  Get on board and get on board.
[1:03:40.960 --> 1:03:42.960]  Get on board and get on board.
[1:03:42.960 --> 1:03:44.960]  Because the world always needs help.
[1:03:44.960 --> 1:03:46.960]  Get on board and cry.
[1:03:46.960 --> 1:03:48.960]  Come on, try a little cry.
[1:03:48.960 --> 1:03:50.960]  We'll convert your children.
[1:03:50.960 --> 1:03:52.960]  We'll convert your children.
[1:03:52.960 --> 1:03:54.960]  Then we'll turn to you.
[1:03:54.960 --> 1:03:56.960]  Giving all the fear inside.
[1:03:56.960 --> 1:03:58.960]  It is freeing like you never knew.
[1:03:58.960 --> 1:04:00.960]  Go into San Francisco.
[1:04:00.960 --> 1:04:02.960]  Go and turn up that disco.
[1:04:02.960 --> 1:04:04.960]  You'll forget you were ever upset.
[1:04:04.960 --> 1:04:06.960]  We'll convert your children.
[1:04:06.960 --> 1:04:08.960]  And make an ally of you again.
[1:04:08.960 --> 1:04:10.960]  These are people that fell to Satan.
[1:04:10.960 --> 1:04:12.960]  These are people that fell to Satan.
[1:04:12.960 --> 1:04:14.960]  These are people that fell to Satan.
[1:04:14.960 --> 1:04:16.960]  These are people that fell to Satan.
[1:04:16.960 --> 1:04:18.960]  These are people that fell to Satan.
[1:04:18.960 --> 1:04:20.960]  These are soulless zombies now.
[1:04:20.960 --> 1:04:22.960]  They only feel like they're alive
[1:04:22.960 --> 1:04:24.960]  when they're destroying innocents.
[1:04:24.960 --> 1:04:26.960]  We should be very sad we lost these people.
[1:04:26.960 --> 1:04:28.960]  And we should not make fun of them.
[1:04:28.960 --> 1:04:30.960]  We should stand against them and protect our children
[1:04:30.960 --> 1:04:32.960]  from them.
[1:04:32.960 --> 1:04:34.960]  I'm pushing an overly sexualized agenda.
[1:04:34.960 --> 1:04:36.960]  Are you nervous? Yes.
[1:04:36.960 --> 1:04:38.960]  You want to touch my hair? No.
[1:04:38.960 --> 1:04:40.960]  And for the children and the people that support it
[1:04:40.960 --> 1:04:42.960]  are going to realize that this is going to be
[1:04:42.960 --> 1:04:44.960]  the grooming of the next generation.
[1:04:44.960 --> 1:04:46.960]  Yep.
[1:04:46.960 --> 1:04:48.960]  They go to city councils and they say
[1:04:48.960 --> 1:04:50.960]  we're grooming your children.
[1:04:50.960 --> 1:04:52.960]  They're ours.
[1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:54.960]  We're going to convince them to have their genitals cut off.
[1:04:54.960 --> 1:05:18.960]  We're going to convince them to have their genitals cut off.
[1:05:18.960 --> 1:05:25.960]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[1:05:25.960 --> 1:05:28.960]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be
[1:05:28.960 --> 1:05:30.960]  helpful for a variety of health conditions
[1:05:30.960 --> 1:05:32.960]  including those with osteoarthritis
[1:05:32.960 --> 1:05:34.960]  and for those with pain after surgery
[1:05:34.960 --> 1:05:36.960]  studies have shown.
[1:05:36.960 --> 1:05:38.960]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves
[1:05:38.960 --> 1:05:40.960]  you probably already know that they play an important role
[1:05:40.960 --> 1:05:42.960]  in nutrition, immune defense
[1:05:42.960 --> 1:05:44.960]  and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[1:05:44.960 --> 1:05:48.960]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate
[1:05:48.960 --> 1:05:50.960]  even in affluent populations
[1:05:50.960 --> 1:05:52.960]  like here in America.
[1:05:52.960 --> 1:05:54.960]  So next time you visit be sure to check it out
[1:05:54.960 --> 1:05:56.960]  at infoorstore.com where we promise
[1:05:56.960 --> 1:06:20.960]  our rose hips don't lie.
[1:06:20.960 --> 1:06:24.960]  Ladies and gentlemen we are now into hour number two on this live Monday
[1:06:24.960 --> 1:06:26.960]  June 27th broadcast.
[1:06:26.960 --> 1:06:28.960]  We have a true warrior
[1:06:28.960 --> 1:06:30.960]  and a champion
[1:06:30.960 --> 1:06:32.960]  of the fight for the unborn
[1:06:32.960 --> 1:06:34.960]  and now the born. They're wanting to kill babies.
[1:06:34.960 --> 1:06:36.960]  After they're born
[1:06:36.960 --> 1:06:38.960]  a champion for life against euthanasia
[1:06:38.960 --> 1:06:40.960]  against all of it
[1:06:40.960 --> 1:06:42.960]  is John Henry Weston
[1:06:42.960 --> 1:06:44.960]  and he of course
[1:06:44.960 --> 1:06:46.960]  heads up the great organization
[1:06:46.960 --> 1:06:48.960]  Lifesight News. He's been on with us many times
[1:06:48.960 --> 1:06:50.960]  and I've been reading his website for
[1:06:50.960 --> 1:06:52.960]  more than a decade and covering
[1:06:52.960 --> 1:06:54.960]  incredible information that they lay out
[1:06:54.960 --> 1:06:56.960]  at lifesightnews.com
[1:06:56.960 --> 1:06:58.960]  and we couldn't get a better person
[1:06:58.960 --> 1:07:00.960]  on today
[1:07:00.960 --> 1:07:02.960]  to talk about this historic ruling
[1:07:02.960 --> 1:07:04.960]  last week
[1:07:04.960 --> 1:07:06.960]  and the responses to it
[1:07:06.960 --> 1:07:08.960]  and what the next phase of the battle
[1:07:08.960 --> 1:07:10.960]  is going to be both by
[1:07:10.960 --> 1:07:12.960]  those drunk on the blood of the innocents
[1:07:12.960 --> 1:07:14.960]  and those of us whose hearts are convicted
[1:07:14.960 --> 1:07:16.960]  trying to stop it.
[1:07:16.960 --> 1:07:18.960]  The Democrats are now threatening civil war
[1:07:18.960 --> 1:07:20.960]  they're now saying they're going to hand out
[1:07:20.960 --> 1:07:22.960]  morning after pills everywhere out of vending machines
[1:07:22.960 --> 1:07:24.960]  that's going to be the new fight
[1:07:24.960 --> 1:07:26.960]  very toxic, very dangerous
[1:07:26.960 --> 1:07:28.960]  pills that they can kill women
[1:07:28.960 --> 1:07:30.960]  we've got all of this and more
[1:07:30.960 --> 1:07:32.960]  to discuss with him
[1:07:32.960 --> 1:07:34.960]  and then it's all interconnected
[1:07:34.960 --> 1:07:36.960]  the pedophile parades nationwide
[1:07:36.960 --> 1:07:38.960]  parading children through the streets with naked men
[1:07:38.960 --> 1:07:40.960]  eating feces, urinating on each other
[1:07:40.960 --> 1:07:42.960]  folks we can't show you this on TV
[1:07:42.960 --> 1:07:44.960]  we're on a lot of TV stations
[1:07:44.960 --> 1:07:46.960]  and cable stations, we can't show you this
[1:07:46.960 --> 1:07:48.960]  but children are being subjected
[1:07:48.960 --> 1:07:50.960]  to it so the stuff we showed you
[1:07:50.960 --> 1:07:52.960]  if you think it was bad earlier
[1:07:52.960 --> 1:07:54.960]  in the last hour is nothing
[1:07:54.960 --> 1:07:56.960]  I literally have had nightmares
[1:07:56.960 --> 1:07:58.960]  in the last three days over having to review this stuff
[1:07:58.960 --> 1:08:00.960]  because it's one thing
[1:08:00.960 --> 1:08:02.960]  to see these sick
[1:08:02.960 --> 1:08:04.960]  pedophile
[1:08:04.960 --> 1:08:06.960]  pervert freaks dancing around
[1:08:06.960 --> 1:08:08.960]  but little kids looking very upset
[1:08:08.960 --> 1:08:10.960]  very threatened with their parents
[1:08:10.960 --> 1:08:12.960]  shoving them into the arms of
[1:08:12.960 --> 1:08:14.960]  MOLOC to have their innocence destroyed
[1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:16.960]  it's just unbelievable
[1:08:16.960 --> 1:08:18.960]  that he is true mass demonic possession
[1:08:18.960 --> 1:08:20.960]  in my view but I'm ranting
[1:08:20.960 --> 1:08:22.960]  I appreciate John Henry
[1:08:22.960 --> 1:08:24.960]  Weston the head of LifeSiteNews
[1:08:24.960 --> 1:08:26.960]  LifeSiteNews.com joining us
[1:08:26.960 --> 1:08:28.960]  a real world expert on this
[1:08:28.960 --> 1:08:30.960]  it's got to be satisfying
[1:08:30.960 --> 1:08:32.960]  after your decades and decades of this long fight
[1:08:32.960 --> 1:08:34.960]  beating one of the leading
[1:08:34.960 --> 1:08:36.960]  if not the leading pro life site in the world
[1:08:36.960 --> 1:08:38.960]  to see so much success happening
[1:08:38.960 --> 1:08:40.960]  and so thank you for joining us, congratulations
[1:08:40.960 --> 1:08:42.960]  thank you so much Alice, good to be with you
[1:08:42.960 --> 1:08:44.960]  where do you want to start
[1:08:44.960 --> 1:08:46.960]  well first of all praise the god
[1:08:46.960 --> 1:08:48.960]  what an incredible thing
[1:08:48.960 --> 1:08:50.960]  and who would have thought
[1:08:50.960 --> 1:08:52.960]  I think realists
[1:08:52.960 --> 1:08:54.960]  like you are
[1:08:54.960 --> 1:08:56.960]  would have said
[1:08:56.960 --> 1:08:58.960]  I don't know even though
[1:08:58.960 --> 1:09:00.960]  yes we made some good appointments
[1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:02.960]  but then there have been betrayals
[1:09:02.960 --> 1:09:04.960]  among the Supreme Court justices
[1:09:04.960 --> 1:09:06.960]  but
[1:09:06.960 --> 1:09:08.960]  Trump gave us what we needed to get over the
[1:09:08.960 --> 1:09:10.960]  over the hump in terms of the Supreme Court
[1:09:10.960 --> 1:09:12.960]  but it was still incredible
[1:09:12.960 --> 1:09:14.960]  when the leak came
[1:09:14.960 --> 1:09:16.960]  in May and the left
[1:09:16.960 --> 1:09:18.960]  went insane
[1:09:18.960 --> 1:09:20.960]  there was a lot still on the table
[1:09:20.960 --> 1:09:22.960]  we knew that should one of the justices
[1:09:22.960 --> 1:09:24.960]  be killed
[1:09:24.960 --> 1:09:26.960]  which was a very real possibility
[1:09:26.960 --> 1:09:28.960]  that the leaked
[1:09:28.960 --> 1:09:30.960]  ruling or the draft ruling wouldn't stand
[1:09:30.960 --> 1:09:32.960]  and that's why we had
[1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:34.960]  an attempt on the life
[1:09:34.960 --> 1:09:36.960]  of Justice Kavanaugh
[1:09:36.960 --> 1:09:38.960]  and it's incredible
[1:09:38.960 --> 1:09:40.960]  because truly what I think happened was
[1:09:40.960 --> 1:09:42.960]  the prayer that went into
[1:09:42.960 --> 1:09:44.960]  defending the lives of the justices
[1:09:44.960 --> 1:09:46.960]  and the prayer that has gone
[1:09:46.960 --> 1:09:48.960]  into ending
[1:09:48.960 --> 1:09:50.960]  Roe v. Wade for
[1:09:50.960 --> 1:09:52.960]  50 years
[1:09:52.960 --> 1:09:54.960]  has come true so that our lord is able to
[1:09:54.960 --> 1:09:56.960]  now
[1:09:56.960 --> 1:09:58.960]  you're going to see a very divided United States
[1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:02.960]  you're going to have some states
[1:10:02.960 --> 1:10:04.960]  where the
[1:10:04.960 --> 1:10:06.960]  blood will continue to be shed
[1:10:06.960 --> 1:10:08.960]  where the blood of the innocent
[1:10:08.960 --> 1:10:10.960]  which cries to heaven
[1:10:10.960 --> 1:10:12.960]  for vengeance
[1:10:12.960 --> 1:10:14.960]  as the scriptures say
[1:10:14.960 --> 1:10:16.960]  will continue to flow
[1:10:16.960 --> 1:10:18.960]  but in certain states
[1:10:18.960 --> 1:10:20.960]  10 right off the bat but another 10
[1:10:20.960 --> 1:10:22.960]  that are going to come online very soon
[1:10:22.960 --> 1:10:24.960]  the protection
[1:10:24.960 --> 1:10:26.960]  of life of the innocent in their mother's womb
[1:10:26.960 --> 1:10:28.960]  is now protected by law
[1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:30.960]  the way it should be
[1:10:30.960 --> 1:10:32.960]  all of a sudden
[1:10:32.960 --> 1:10:34.960]  at least this basic element of civilization
[1:10:34.960 --> 1:10:36.960]  has been restored
[1:10:36.960 --> 1:10:38.960]  a good part of the United States
[1:10:38.960 --> 1:10:40.960]  of America
[1:10:40.960 --> 1:10:42.960]  so that God's blessing can once again
[1:10:42.960 --> 1:10:44.960]  flow
[1:10:44.960 --> 1:10:46.960]  but it's a divided America
[1:10:46.960 --> 1:10:48.960]  you have all these other states
[1:10:48.960 --> 1:10:50.960]  which want to call themselves a sanctuary
[1:10:50.960 --> 1:10:52.960]  for abortion
[1:10:52.960 --> 1:10:54.960]  where they're saying
[1:10:54.960 --> 1:10:56.960]  please come let us kill your children
[1:10:56.960 --> 1:10:58.960]  they put it of course in their own
[1:10:58.960 --> 1:11:00.960]  terminology but that's exactly what it is
[1:11:00.960 --> 1:11:02.960]  so it's a divided America
[1:11:02.960 --> 1:11:04.960]  and what the ruling does
[1:11:04.960 --> 1:11:06.960]  is it brings the battle
[1:11:06.960 --> 1:11:08.960]  to the states
[1:11:08.960 --> 1:11:10.960]  no longer
[1:11:10.960 --> 1:11:12.960]  can the federal government
[1:11:12.960 --> 1:11:14.960]  force abortion on unwilling states
[1:11:14.960 --> 1:11:16.960]  so that in Alabama
[1:11:16.960 --> 1:11:18.960]  and other places where they want
[1:11:18.960 --> 1:11:20.960]  the legislature
[1:11:20.960 --> 1:11:22.960]  was voted in to protect life
[1:11:22.960 --> 1:11:24.960]  no longer can the federal
[1:11:24.960 --> 1:11:26.960]  just say hey you got to do it anyway
[1:11:26.960 --> 1:11:28.960]  most of your people
[1:11:28.960 --> 1:11:30.960]  the vast majority of your people want to protect life
[1:11:30.960 --> 1:11:32.960]  tough luck we're going to kill your babies
[1:11:32.960 --> 1:11:34.960]  anyhow we're going to legalize it
[1:11:34.960 --> 1:11:36.960]  no no more
[1:11:36.960 --> 1:11:38.960]  now the states get to decide for themselves
[1:11:38.960 --> 1:11:40.960]  so the battle is there
[1:11:40.960 --> 1:11:42.960]  now at the state level
[1:11:42.960 --> 1:11:44.960]  there's a lot of work to be done
[1:11:44.960 --> 1:11:46.960]  and the work to be done is not only
[1:11:46.960 --> 1:11:48.960]  at the legislative level
[1:11:48.960 --> 1:11:50.960]  but it's also obviously
[1:11:50.960 --> 1:11:52.960]  working to change minds and hearts
[1:11:52.960 --> 1:11:54.960]  to support women who find themselves
[1:11:54.960 --> 1:11:56.960]  in troubled pregnancies
[1:11:56.960 --> 1:11:58.960]  in unexpected pregnancies
[1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:00.960]  to educate people on abstinence
[1:12:00.960 --> 1:12:02.960]  and the reality of marriage
[1:12:02.960 --> 1:12:04.960]  and everything else that leads to life
[1:12:04.960 --> 1:12:06.960]  and this great gift of sexuality
[1:12:06.960 --> 1:12:08.960]  which is meant for procreation
[1:12:08.960 --> 1:12:10.960]  and to bring it all back to normalcy
[1:12:10.960 --> 1:12:12.960]  so we need to get there
[1:12:12.960 --> 1:12:14.960]  there's a lot of work to be done
[1:12:14.960 --> 1:12:16.960]  but an amazing first step
[1:12:16.960 --> 1:12:18.960]  because while some people say oh it does nothing
[1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:20.960]  it does nothing
[1:12:20.960 --> 1:12:22.960]  actually it does something
[1:12:22.960 --> 1:12:24.960]  because the law in addition
[1:12:24.960 --> 1:12:26.960]  to what it is on its face
[1:12:26.960 --> 1:12:28.960]  in terms of protection and police powers
[1:12:28.960 --> 1:12:30.960]  so the very fact
[1:12:30.960 --> 1:12:32.960]  that laws are now on the books
[1:12:32.960 --> 1:12:34.960]  in many states
[1:12:34.960 --> 1:12:36.960]  that protect life from conception
[1:12:36.960 --> 1:12:38.960]  will teach people
[1:12:38.960 --> 1:12:40.960]  that once again the value of life
[1:12:40.960 --> 1:12:42.960]  is real
[1:12:42.960 --> 1:12:44.960]  and it should be protected
[1:12:44.960 --> 1:12:46.960]  should be protected in law
[1:12:46.960 --> 1:12:48.960]  I'm not a theologian like
[1:12:48.960 --> 1:12:50.960]  you and many of your crew are
[1:12:50.960 --> 1:12:52.960]  I know you're just immersed in it
[1:12:52.960 --> 1:12:54.960]  but I remember Sunday school and reading the bible
[1:12:54.960 --> 1:12:56.960]  and it seems like common sense to me
[1:12:56.960 --> 1:12:58.960]  that it would lead governments
[1:12:58.960 --> 1:13:00.960]  to have righteous rules
[1:13:00.960 --> 1:13:02.960]  and God would hold it against the population
[1:13:02.960 --> 1:13:04.960]  even if a lot of the population was good
[1:13:04.960 --> 1:13:06.960]  if the government was carrying out evil
[1:13:06.960 --> 1:13:08.960]  and then if the people didn't oppose it
[1:13:08.960 --> 1:13:10.960]  they would then basically
[1:13:10.960 --> 1:13:12.960]  not receive the blessings of God anymore
[1:13:12.960 --> 1:13:14.960]  and that's how I see this
[1:13:14.960 --> 1:13:16.960]  it divides the wheat from the shaft
[1:13:16.960 --> 1:13:18.960]  the goats from the sheep
[1:13:18.960 --> 1:13:20.960]  it'll bring the evil of these people out in the open
[1:13:20.960 --> 1:13:22.960]  and how horrible they act
[1:13:22.960 --> 1:13:24.960]  and the simulation of killing children
[1:13:24.960 --> 1:13:26.960]  it's about killing babies
[1:13:26.960 --> 1:13:28.960]  and really the operating system of the democrats
[1:13:28.960 --> 1:13:30.960]  is now overtly Satanistic
[1:13:30.960 --> 1:13:32.960]  and getting more intense
[1:13:32.960 --> 1:13:34.960]  and so that bringing out this evil
[1:13:34.960 --> 1:13:36.960]  will then further convict other people's hearts
[1:13:36.960 --> 1:13:38.960]  to really wake up and understand
[1:13:38.960 --> 1:13:40.960]  this is a battle between good and evil
[1:13:40.960 --> 1:13:42.960]  and so I do see this as a gigantic victory
[1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:44.960]  as you were saying
[1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:46.960]  moving us really fast in the right direction
[1:13:46.960 --> 1:13:48.960]  and Trump was far from perfect
[1:13:48.960 --> 1:13:50.960]  but his grand amazing
[1:13:50.960 --> 1:13:52.960]  victory
[1:13:52.960 --> 1:13:54.960]  regardless of what happens to Trump in the future
[1:13:54.960 --> 1:13:56.960]  is that he said he would do this in that debate
[1:13:56.960 --> 1:13:58.960]  six years ago with Hillary
[1:13:58.960 --> 1:14:00.960]  and he delivered on it and it happened
[1:14:00.960 --> 1:14:02.960]  and that makes Trump amazing
[1:14:02.960 --> 1:14:04.960]  and a blessing and an incredible man
[1:14:04.960 --> 1:14:06.960]  you judge a tree by its fruits
[1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:08.960]  no way Trump's bad doing something like that
[1:14:08.960 --> 1:14:10.960]  well absolutely
[1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:12.960]  so what an incredible gift
[1:14:12.960 --> 1:14:14.960]  if he did absolutely nothing else
[1:14:14.960 --> 1:14:16.960]  that would have been worth it in spades
[1:14:16.960 --> 1:14:18.960]  because the number of American children's lives
[1:14:18.960 --> 1:14:20.960]  he's saved by those appointments
[1:14:20.960 --> 1:14:22.960]  will only be seen in the future
[1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:24.960]  and it will redound to his own blessing
[1:14:24.960 --> 1:14:26.960]  you know there's a lot that Trump has to answer for
[1:14:26.960 --> 1:14:28.960]  but you know what
[1:14:28.960 --> 1:14:30.960]  this is going to work in his favor
[1:14:30.960 --> 1:14:32.960]  when he has to meet his maker
[1:14:32.960 --> 1:14:34.960]  in terms of what you were talking about
[1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:36.960]  it's very interesting
[1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:38.960]  yes
[1:14:38.960 --> 1:14:40.960]  the bombing and fire bombing of churches
[1:14:40.960 --> 1:14:42.960]  and vandalism and threats
[1:14:42.960 --> 1:14:44.960]  and all of the hell
[1:14:44.960 --> 1:14:46.960]  that we're seeing break out
[1:14:46.960 --> 1:14:48.960]  because the demon has had a defeat
[1:14:48.960 --> 1:14:50.960]  and now he's flailing
[1:14:50.960 --> 1:14:52.960]  and as you put it in
[1:14:52.960 --> 1:14:54.960]  his minions
[1:14:54.960 --> 1:14:56.960]  these aren't so much
[1:14:56.960 --> 1:14:58.960]  these are people who are lost
[1:14:58.960 --> 1:15:00.960]  that are given to satan the anger
[1:15:00.960 --> 1:15:02.960]  the violence that is coming out of them right now
[1:15:02.960 --> 1:15:04.960]  hopefully it will
[1:15:04.960 --> 1:15:06.960]  they'll look in the mirror and be able to see it
[1:15:06.960 --> 1:15:08.960]  for what it is and turn around
[1:15:08.960 --> 1:15:10.960]  but the one effect
[1:15:10.960 --> 1:15:12.960]  that you mentioned that is so powerful
[1:15:12.960 --> 1:15:14.960]  is that others
[1:15:14.960 --> 1:15:16.960]  will get to see
[1:15:16.960 --> 1:15:18.960]  eyes will be opened
[1:15:18.960 --> 1:15:20.960]  in a way I think that
[1:15:20.960 --> 1:15:22.960]  right now it's not
[1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:24.960]  people can see in the destruction of churches
[1:15:24.960 --> 1:15:26.960]  in the vandalism the fire bombing
[1:15:26.960 --> 1:15:28.960]  the threats to people's lives
[1:15:28.960 --> 1:15:30.960]  the willingness to even commit
[1:15:30.960 --> 1:15:32.960]  murder
[1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:34.960]  people will say wait a minute
[1:15:34.960 --> 1:15:36.960]  I thought this was a movement
[1:15:36.960 --> 1:15:38.960]  about choice and honoring
[1:15:38.960 --> 1:15:40.960]  women and these
[1:15:40.960 --> 1:15:42.960]  these fetuses weren't children really
[1:15:42.960 --> 1:15:44.960]  but all of a sudden
[1:15:44.960 --> 1:15:46.960]  it's becoming clear
[1:15:48.960 --> 1:15:50.960]  satan is letting his guard down
[1:15:50.960 --> 1:15:52.960]  in order to whip up a frenzy
[1:15:52.960 --> 1:15:54.960]  that's right stay right there John Henry

[1:20:16.960 --> 1:20:18.960]  hours and hours of democrats
[1:20:18.960 --> 1:20:20.960]  right here in Austin this weekend
[1:20:20.960 --> 1:20:22.960]  saying I love Satan
[1:20:22.960 --> 1:20:24.960]  I kill children
[1:20:24.960 --> 1:20:26.960]  and you think
[1:20:26.960 --> 1:20:28.960]  they're just trying to freak you out
[1:20:28.960 --> 1:20:30.960]  but we've infiltrated their meetings
[1:20:30.960 --> 1:20:32.960]  we've played the undercover videos
[1:20:32.960 --> 1:20:34.960]  Project Veritas has as well
[1:20:34.960 --> 1:20:36.960]  they have really adopted Satanism
[1:20:36.960 --> 1:20:38.960]  a few years ago
[1:20:38.960 --> 1:20:40.960]  that satanic temple put up that movie
[1:20:40.960 --> 1:20:42.960]  things called Hail Satan
[1:20:42.960 --> 1:20:44.960]  I went to salt with my wife
[1:20:44.960 --> 1:20:46.960]  and the audience at Alamo Draft House
[1:20:46.960 --> 1:20:48.960]  was full of people laughing at the Christians
[1:20:48.960 --> 1:20:50.960]  cheering the Satanists and saying Hail Satan
[1:20:50.960 --> 1:20:52.960]  is cute and funny but it's not a joke
[1:20:52.960 --> 1:20:54.960]  they're actually taking it up
[1:20:54.960 --> 1:20:56.960]  it's like a child pretending to be a police officer
[1:20:56.960 --> 1:20:58.960]  or a fireman and they become one later
[1:20:58.960 --> 1:21:00.960]  okay I mean they're
[1:21:00.960 --> 1:21:02.960]  and there's national articles about
[1:21:02.960 --> 1:21:04.960]  the fastest growing religion
[1:21:04.960 --> 1:21:06.960]  among democrats and leftist is Satanism
[1:21:06.960 --> 1:21:08.960]  look it up
[1:21:08.960 --> 1:21:10.960]  and these satanic churches admit
[1:21:10.960 --> 1:21:12.960]  it's a sacrament of sacrifice
[1:21:12.960 --> 1:21:14.960]  we always told you that
[1:21:14.960 --> 1:21:16.960]  this is a deadly serious
[1:21:16.960 --> 1:21:18.960]  and it's backed by the big corporations
[1:21:18.960 --> 1:21:20.960]  like Disney and others
[1:21:20.960 --> 1:21:22.960]  and this whole agenda of dehumanizing
[1:21:22.960 --> 1:21:24.960]  is run by the god of this world
[1:21:24.960 --> 1:21:26.960]  the following we're going to talk to one of the leading figures
[1:21:26.960 --> 1:21:28.960]  battling this evil how historic this is in a moment
[1:21:28.960 --> 1:21:30.960]  but here's just two clips
[1:21:30.960 --> 1:21:32.960]  one from Saturday
[1:21:32.960 --> 1:21:34.960]  with our reporter Savannah Hernandez
[1:21:34.960 --> 1:21:36.960]  out front the supreme court
[1:21:36.960 --> 1:21:38.960]  just one clip of hundreds we got
[1:21:38.960 --> 1:21:40.960]  this was part of the course
[1:21:40.960 --> 1:21:42.960]  and then a clip from a few years ago
[1:21:42.960 --> 1:21:44.960]  of an abortion doctor
[1:21:44.960 --> 1:21:46.960]  sounding exactly the same with the
[1:21:46.960 --> 1:21:48.960]  conversation calm down
[1:21:48.960 --> 1:21:50.960]  no, I'm not having a conversation
[1:21:50.960 --> 1:21:52.960]  or it was a little
[1:21:52.960 --> 1:21:54.960]  of shit
[1:21:54.960 --> 1:21:56.960]  guess the pandemic's over
[1:21:56.960 --> 1:21:58.960]  okay
[1:21:58.960 --> 1:22:00.960]  what's wrong sir

[1:22:02.960 --> 1:22:04.960]  love killing babies

[1:22:06.960 --> 1:22:08.960]  you love that don't you
[1:22:08.960 --> 1:22:10.960]  you got to repent sir
[1:22:10.960 --> 1:22:12.960]  you got to repent sir for murdering babies
[1:22:12.960 --> 1:22:14.960]  why
[1:22:14.960 --> 1:22:16.960]  why? because it's a sin before God
[1:22:16.960 --> 1:22:18.960]  why?
[1:22:18.960 --> 1:22:20.960]  stinky breath
[1:22:20.960 --> 1:22:22.960]  it's pretty evil of you sir
[1:22:22.960 --> 1:22:24.960]  and I hope and pray that you
[1:22:24.960 --> 1:22:26.960]  huh
[1:22:26.960 --> 1:22:28.960]  well that's what you do to babies huh
[1:22:28.960 --> 1:22:30.960]  I love it
[1:22:30.960 --> 1:22:32.960]  okay I hope that you come to Christ sir
[1:22:32.960 --> 1:22:34.960]  oh I'd ever go to Christ
[1:22:34.960 --> 1:22:36.960]  I hope that you come to Christ sir
[1:22:36.960 --> 1:22:38.960]  I don't listen to Christ
[1:22:38.960 --> 1:22:40.960]  you will have a darkened heart sir
[1:22:40.960 --> 1:22:42.960]  I do have a darkened heart
[1:22:42.960 --> 1:22:44.960]  and you will stand before God
[1:22:44.960 --> 1:22:46.960]  in judgment day
[1:22:46.960 --> 1:22:48.960]  you will stand before God in judgment
[1:22:48.960 --> 1:22:50.960]  yes I will every day
[1:22:50.960 --> 1:22:52.960]  I love it
[1:22:52.960 --> 1:22:54.960]  keep tearing the baby's heart
[1:22:54.960 --> 1:22:56.960]  keep tearing the baby's heart
[1:22:56.960 --> 1:22:58.960]  keep tearing the baby's heart
[1:22:58.960 --> 1:23:00.960]  oh yes sir the babies
[1:23:00.960 --> 1:23:02.960]  they're bloodstreams from the ground
[1:23:02.960 --> 1:23:04.960]  they're bloodstreams from the ground
[1:23:04.960 --> 1:23:06.960]  you are a murderer sir
[1:23:06.960 --> 1:23:08.960]  for radio lizards that don't know
[1:23:08.960 --> 1:23:10.960]  he's in his face hissing like a demon
[1:23:10.960 --> 1:23:12.960]  he's in his hand
[1:23:12.960 --> 1:23:14.960]  and ladies and gentlemen
[1:23:14.960 --> 1:23:16.960]  if you don't believe me I'm begging you
[1:23:16.960 --> 1:23:18.960]  go to a pro-death rally
[1:23:18.960 --> 1:23:20.960]  and these people are the
[1:23:20.960 --> 1:23:22.960]  majority not the minority now
[1:23:22.960 --> 1:23:24.960]  women, men, old people, young people
[1:23:24.960 --> 1:23:26.960]  black people, brown people
[1:23:26.960 --> 1:23:28.960]  but majority white people
[1:23:28.960 --> 1:23:30.960]  literally hissing and acting like demons
[1:23:30.960 --> 1:23:32.960]  you can't make this up
[1:23:32.960 --> 1:23:34.960]  and we can't show you the footage of these
[1:23:34.960 --> 1:23:36.960]  pedophile pride parades
[1:23:36.960 --> 1:23:38.960]  you gotta go to one for yourself
[1:23:38.960 --> 1:23:40.960]  and the feces off the ground
[1:23:40.960 --> 1:23:42.960]  I can't even say it on air
[1:23:42.960 --> 1:23:44.960]  and I even feel evil repeating this stuff folks
[1:23:44.960 --> 1:23:46.960]  but you gotta know
[1:23:46.960 --> 1:23:48.960]  so the poison's coming out
[1:23:48.960 --> 1:23:50.960]  the world's seeing it very eloquent words
[1:23:50.960 --> 1:23:52.960]  by John Henry West
[1:23:52.960 --> 1:23:54.960]  and everybody should visit LifeSiteNews.com
[1:23:54.960 --> 1:23:56.960]  next segment we'll have the floor
[1:23:56.960 --> 1:23:58.960]  but I wanted to spend some time there
[1:23:58.960 --> 1:24:00.960]  but in the five minutes we have left in the shorter segment
[1:24:00.960 --> 1:24:02.960]  what do you make of what we just saw
[1:24:02.960 --> 1:24:04.960]  doesn't that illustrate what you're saying about
[1:24:04.960 --> 1:24:06.960]  the mask is coming off the demons
[1:24:06.960 --> 1:24:08.960]  he drops the mask
[1:24:08.960 --> 1:24:10.960]  it does indeed
[1:24:10.960 --> 1:24:12.960]  it's an incredible thing
[1:24:12.960 --> 1:24:14.960]  it's happening everywhere
[1:24:14.960 --> 1:24:16.960]  I second you in encouraging people
[1:24:16.960 --> 1:24:18.960]  to go to
[1:24:18.960 --> 1:24:20.960]  pro-abortion demonstrations in fact
[1:24:20.960 --> 1:24:22.960]  just go to the March for Life
[1:24:22.960 --> 1:24:24.960]  you'll find the protesters at the March for Life
[1:24:24.960 --> 1:24:26.960]  in fact when we were at the March for Life
[1:24:26.960 --> 1:24:28.960]  just recently in Canada
[1:24:28.960 --> 1:24:30.960]  there was a guy at the back with a satanic flag
[1:24:30.960 --> 1:24:32.960]  he was screaming Hail Satan
[1:24:32.960 --> 1:24:34.960]  we asked him why are you here
[1:24:34.960 --> 1:24:36.960]  you're a satanist so you're at the pro-abortion march
[1:24:36.960 --> 1:24:38.960]  because you're a satanist yes
[1:24:38.960 --> 1:24:40.960]  we also talked to one of these
[1:24:40.960 --> 1:24:42.960]  handmaids women
[1:24:42.960 --> 1:24:44.960]  it was 30, 32, 33 degrees
[1:24:44.960 --> 1:24:46.960]  Celsius
[1:24:46.960 --> 1:24:48.960]  so in Fahrenheit it's over 90
[1:24:48.960 --> 1:24:50.960]  and we asked her what are you doing here
[1:24:50.960 --> 1:24:52.960]  what, what
[1:24:52.960 --> 1:24:54.960]  why are you doing this when it's so hot
[1:24:54.960 --> 1:24:56.960]  and yet you're doing this
[1:24:56.960 --> 1:24:58.960]  she said it's spiritual
[1:24:58.960 --> 1:25:00.960]  so it's very real
[1:25:00.960 --> 1:25:02.960]  it's very out there
[1:25:02.960 --> 1:25:04.960]  this is a satanic movement
[1:25:04.960 --> 1:25:06.960]  the mask is coming down
[1:25:06.960 --> 1:25:08.960]  and you're able to see it for yourself
[1:25:08.960 --> 1:25:10.960]  and hopefully a lot of that middle America
[1:25:10.960 --> 1:25:12.960]  that isn't really
[1:25:12.960 --> 1:25:14.960]  on either side but they're generally
[1:25:14.960 --> 1:25:16.960]  what they call pro-choice
[1:25:16.960 --> 1:25:18.960]  we want women to do what they do
[1:25:18.960 --> 1:25:20.960]  finally can see
[1:25:20.960 --> 1:25:22.960]  wait a minute
[1:25:22.960 --> 1:25:24.960]  this is really the side of evil
[1:25:24.960 --> 1:25:26.960]  and it's time to wake up
[1:25:26.960 --> 1:25:28.960]  it's time to turn around
[1:25:28.960 --> 1:25:30.960]  and really on the part of
[1:25:30.960 --> 1:25:32.960]  value life
[1:25:32.960 --> 1:25:34.960]  those who value God we have to understand
[1:25:34.960 --> 1:25:36.960]  this is on us
[1:25:36.960 --> 1:25:38.960]  remember what the scriptures say
[1:25:38.960 --> 1:25:40.960]  if my people
[1:25:40.960 --> 1:25:42.960]  will turn from their wicked ways
[1:25:42.960 --> 1:25:44.960]  if they will turn to me and heed my voice
[1:25:44.960 --> 1:25:46.960]  I will bless
[1:25:46.960 --> 1:25:48.960]  their land
[1:25:48.960 --> 1:25:50.960]  the whole land
[1:25:50.960 --> 1:25:52.960]  the whole of the United States of America
[1:25:52.960 --> 1:25:54.960]  the whole of the West will be
[1:25:54.960 --> 1:25:56.960]  blessed if Christians
[1:25:56.960 --> 1:25:58.960]  turn to Christ
[1:25:58.960 --> 1:26:00.960]  and Christians get on their knees
[1:26:00.960 --> 1:26:02.960]  the only way we got
[1:26:02.960 --> 1:26:04.960]  to the overturning of Roe v. Wade
[1:26:04.960 --> 1:26:06.960]  in the Dove's decision just now
[1:26:06.960 --> 1:26:08.960]  was because of prayer
[1:26:08.960 --> 1:26:10.960]  get your prayer pants on
[1:26:10.960 --> 1:26:12.960]  wear out those praying knees
[1:26:12.960 --> 1:26:14.960]  as the song says
[1:26:14.960 --> 1:26:16.960]  this is what we need in America
[1:26:16.960 --> 1:26:18.960]  this is what we need in the whole of the world
[1:26:18.960 --> 1:26:20.960]  and this is the path
[1:26:20.960 --> 1:26:22.960]  to victory
[1:26:22.960 --> 1:26:24.960]  and Christ has already won that victory
[1:26:24.960 --> 1:26:26.960]  it's just ours now
[1:26:26.960 --> 1:26:28.960]  we need sacrifices with His on the cross
[1:26:28.960 --> 1:26:30.960]  and for that we will be blessed
[1:26:30.960 --> 1:26:32.960]  in amazing ways
[1:26:32.960 --> 1:26:34.960]  what do you expect them to do next
[1:26:34.960 --> 1:26:36.960]  they're threatening violence, they're carrying out violence
[1:26:36.960 --> 1:26:38.960]  they're just beside themselves
[1:26:38.960 --> 1:26:40.960]  they're talking about packing the court
[1:26:40.960 --> 1:26:42.960]  they're talking about impeaching the court
[1:26:42.960 --> 1:26:44.960]  they're in a red rage
[1:26:44.960 --> 1:26:46.960]  how do you see this affecting the election
[1:26:46.960 --> 1:26:48.960]  I think it backfires
[1:26:48.960 --> 1:26:50.960]  I think it energizes Christians and conservatives
[1:26:50.960 --> 1:26:52.960]  and as you said short story
[1:26:52.960 --> 1:26:54.960]  not name-dropping it's where I was
[1:26:54.960 --> 1:26:56.960]  but Jesse James famous outlaw guy
[1:26:56.960 --> 1:26:58.960]  and his wife he's been marrying
[1:26:58.960 --> 1:27:00.960]  a really nice lady
[1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:02.960]  with her own story passed
[1:27:02.960 --> 1:27:04.960]  and a bunch of these friends were there
[1:27:04.960 --> 1:27:06.960]  some of which I've known for years
[1:27:06.960 --> 1:27:08.960]  because I've known Jesse for a long time
[1:27:08.960 --> 1:27:10.960]  and they're all right-wing conservatives
[1:27:10.960 --> 1:27:12.960]  now he's been a right-winger forever
[1:27:12.960 --> 1:27:14.960]  but they're all right-wing conservatives now
[1:27:14.960 --> 1:27:16.960]  they used to be super liberal women
[1:27:16.960 --> 1:27:18.960]  and we're sitting around the table they're like
[1:27:18.960 --> 1:27:20.960]  I used to be pro-abortion like it was just a choice
[1:27:20.960 --> 1:27:22.960]  and you know it doesn't feel anything
[1:27:22.960 --> 1:27:24.960]  and it's evil and all these liberal women
[1:27:24.960 --> 1:27:26.960]  who've been liberal are now
[1:27:26.960 --> 1:27:28.960]  super right-wing Christians
[1:27:28.960 --> 1:27:30.960]  without even having to go to church
[1:27:30.960 --> 1:27:32.960]  of course I went to church with Jesse as well
[1:27:32.960 --> 1:27:34.960]  and his wife yesterday but the point is
[1:27:34.960 --> 1:27:36.960]  is that they're being converted
[1:27:36.960 --> 1:27:38.960]  by seeing the evil of these minions
[1:27:38.960 --> 1:27:40.960]  they're like I don't want to be like that person
[1:27:40.960 --> 1:27:42.960]  because they see how soulless and ugly
[1:27:42.960 --> 1:27:44.960]  and horrible they are
[1:27:44.960 --> 1:27:46.960]  and it makes them scared
[1:27:46.960 --> 1:27:48.960]  gosh I don't want to be one of those
[1:27:48.960 --> 1:27:50.960]  you know it's truly amazing Alex
[1:27:50.960 --> 1:27:52.960]  but McCorvey
[1:27:52.960 --> 1:27:54.960]  the Roe of Roe v Wade
[1:27:54.960 --> 1:27:56.960]  was herself
[1:27:56.960 --> 1:27:58.960]  taken in
[1:27:58.960 --> 1:28:00.960]  by abortion supporters
[1:28:00.960 --> 1:28:02.960]  who basically
[1:28:02.960 --> 1:28:04.960]  sort of cajoled her into doing what she did
[1:28:04.960 --> 1:28:06.960]  and
[1:28:06.960 --> 1:28:08.960]  she saw the light after
[1:28:08.960 --> 1:28:10.960]  she had a conversion
[1:28:10.960 --> 1:28:12.960]  she became a Christian she fought for life
[1:28:12.960 --> 1:28:14.960]  for the rest of her life
[1:28:14.960 --> 1:28:16.960]  and she was of course scarred
[1:28:16.960 --> 1:28:18.960]  by what happened to her but
[1:28:18.960 --> 1:28:20.960]  she worked with an organization called
[1:28:20.960 --> 1:28:22.960]  Silent No More which is connected to priests for life
[1:28:22.960 --> 1:28:24.960]  the great father Frank Pavone
[1:28:24.960 --> 1:28:26.960]  and his
[1:28:26.960 --> 1:28:28.960]  great friend and co-worker Janet Morana
[1:28:28.960 --> 1:28:30.960]  and
[1:28:30.960 --> 1:28:32.960]  they were with Norma
[1:28:32.960 --> 1:28:34.960]  as Norma was dying
[1:28:34.960 --> 1:28:36.960]  and she begged them
[1:28:36.960 --> 1:28:38.960]  to continue the fight
[1:28:38.960 --> 1:28:40.960]  until Roe v Wade was overturned
[1:28:40.960 --> 1:28:42.960]  and I texted them
[1:28:42.960 --> 1:28:44.960]  on Friday
[1:28:44.960 --> 1:28:46.960]  the both of them father Pavone
[1:28:46.960 --> 1:28:48.960]  and Janet Morana
[1:28:48.960 --> 1:28:50.960]  and I said to them
[1:28:50.960 --> 1:28:52.960]  you can tell Norma now
[1:28:52.960 --> 1:28:54.960]  promised fulfilled
[1:28:54.960 --> 1:28:56.960]  they promised that they would work
[1:28:56.960 --> 1:28:58.960]  let's repeat that when we come back
[1:28:58.960 --> 1:29:00.960]  the powerful combination
[1:29:00.960 --> 1:29:02.960]  of both vitamin C
[1:29:02.960 --> 1:29:04.960]  and zinc are great stepping stones
[1:29:04.960 --> 1:29:06.960]  to leading a healthier life
[1:29:06.960 --> 1:29:08.960]  Info Wars has made it easier to make sure
[1:29:08.960 --> 1:29:10.960]  you are getting enough in your system
[1:29:10.960 --> 1:29:12.960]  with a supplement that contains both
[1:29:12.960 --> 1:29:14.960]  this Info Wars life offering
[1:29:14.960 --> 1:29:16.960]  zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase
[1:29:16.960 --> 1:29:18.960]  from the Info Wars store
[1:29:18.960 --> 1:29:20.960]  the rose hips contained within are a part
[1:29:20.960 --> 1:29:22.960]  of the rose flower just below the petals
[1:29:22.960 --> 1:29:24.960]  that contain the rose plant seeds
[1:29:24.960 --> 1:29:26.960]  natural chemicals found
[1:29:26.960 --> 1:29:28.960]  in the hips may even be
[1:29:28.960 --> 1:29:30.960]  helpful for a variety of health conditions
[1:29:30.960 --> 1:29:32.960]  including those with osteoarthritis
[1:29:32.960 --> 1:29:34.960]  and for those with pain after surgery
[1:29:34.960 --> 1:29:36.960]  studies have shown
[1:29:36.960 --> 1:29:38.960]  as for vitamin C and zinc themselves
[1:29:38.960 --> 1:29:40.960]  you probably already know that they play
[1:29:40.960 --> 1:29:42.960]  an important role in nutrition
[1:29:42.960 --> 1:29:44.960]  and defense and the maintenance of your everyday health
[1:29:44.960 --> 1:29:46.960]  it has been reported that
[1:29:46.960 --> 1:29:48.960]  intake of both is often inadequate
[1:29:48.960 --> 1:29:50.960]  even in affluent populations
[1:29:50.960 --> 1:29:52.960]  like here in America
[1:29:52.960 --> 1:29:54.960]  so next time you visit be sure to check it out
[1:29:54.960 --> 1:29:56.960]  at InfoWarsStore.com where we promise
[1:29:56.960 --> 1:29:58.960]  our rose hips don't lie
[1:29:58.960 --> 1:30:00.960]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria
[1:30:00.960 --> 1:30:02.960]  or pump gas or whether you're a farmer
[1:30:02.960 --> 1:30:04.960]  a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire
[1:30:04.960 --> 1:30:06.960]  Fortune and Money Magazine
[1:30:06.960 --> 1:30:08.960]  have all done these profiles
[1:30:08.960 --> 1:30:10.960]  you see it every year 30 different tax returns
[1:30:10.960 --> 1:30:12.960]  30 different answers
[1:30:12.960 --> 1:30:14.960]  50 different tax returns, 50 different answers
[1:30:14.960 --> 1:30:16.960]  and almost all of them just
[1:30:16.960 --> 1:30:18.960]  screw you over especially the big firms
[1:30:18.960 --> 1:30:20.960]  and the big tax groups
[1:30:20.960 --> 1:30:22.960]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public
[1:30:22.960 --> 1:30:24.960]  understanding this and knowing this
[1:30:24.960 --> 1:30:26.960]  so it's a very important situation
[1:30:26.960 --> 1:30:28.960]  with inflation and all the things out there
[1:30:28.960 --> 1:30:30.960]  hurting everybody
[1:30:30.960 --> 1:30:32.960]  to be able to do things
[1:30:32.960 --> 1:30:34.960]  tax wise it's legal and lawful
[1:30:34.960 --> 1:30:36.960]  that allows you to keep more of your money
[1:30:36.960 --> 1:30:38.960]  we wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice
[1:30:38.960 --> 1:30:40.960]  in the last few years
[1:30:40.960 --> 1:30:42.960]  the only way you fail
[1:30:42.960 --> 1:30:44.960]  is not writing down the URL
[1:30:44.960 --> 1:30:46.960]  jonestaxrelief.com
[1:30:46.960 --> 1:30:48.960]  one word jonestaxrelief.com
[1:30:48.960 --> 1:30:50.960]  or call 833-900-4285
[1:30:50.960 --> 1:31:16.960]  833-900-4285
[1:31:16.960 --> 1:31:26.960]  833-900-4285
[1:31:26.960 --> 1:31:44.960]  833-900-4285
[1:31:44.960 --> 1:31:58.960]  833-900-4285
[1:31:58.960 --> 1:32:00.960]  there is nothing there is no more
[1:32:00.960 --> 1:32:02.960]  epitome of free speech
[1:32:02.960 --> 1:32:04.960]  than right here
[1:32:04.960 --> 1:32:06.960]  and that's what people
[1:32:06.960 --> 1:32:08.960]  recognize and resonate with
[1:32:08.960 --> 1:32:10.960]  and as word said you're not going to find a better place
[1:32:10.960 --> 1:32:12.960]  for information
[1:32:12.960 --> 1:32:14.960]  you might not agree with everything
[1:32:14.960 --> 1:32:16.960]  you might not agree with all our perspectives
[1:32:16.960 --> 1:32:18.960]  but we cover all the information
[1:32:18.960 --> 1:32:20.960]  and there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here
[1:32:20.960 --> 1:32:22.960]  thank you for that word
[1:32:22.960 --> 1:32:24.960]  infowarstore.com by the way
[1:32:24.960 --> 1:32:26.960]  the products he mentions infowarstore.com
[1:32:26.960 --> 1:32:28.960]  is where to get them folks and we do have
[1:32:28.960 --> 1:32:30.960]  the best supplements I mean
[1:32:30.960 --> 1:32:32.960]  just like we try our best
[1:32:32.960 --> 1:32:34.960]  with our news coverage and our information
[1:32:34.960 --> 1:32:36.960]  we do the best with our
[1:32:36.960 --> 1:32:38.960]  supplements as well
[1:32:38.960 --> 1:32:40.960]  I mean look at the hair and beard support formula
[1:32:40.960 --> 1:32:42.960]  I mean we're giving this thing away
[1:32:42.960 --> 1:32:44.960]  it's 75% off by the way
[1:32:44.960 --> 1:32:46.960]  it works for me in case you haven't noticed
[1:32:46.960 --> 1:32:48.960]  the hair and beard formula is working
[1:32:48.960 --> 1:32:50.960]  for me
[1:32:50.960 --> 1:32:52.960]  quite well I might add
[1:32:52.960 --> 1:32:54.960]  quite well my barber appreciates
[1:32:54.960 --> 1:32:56.960]  hair and beard support for men
[1:32:56.960 --> 1:32:58.960]  I go and see him quite often now
[1:32:58.960 --> 1:33:00.960]  leading a frontal assault
[1:33:00.960 --> 1:33:02.960]  on the lies of the New World Order
[1:33:02.960 --> 1:33:04.960]  it's Alex Jones
[1:33:04.960 --> 1:33:06.960]  from the front lines
[1:33:06.960 --> 1:33:08.960]  of the information war
[1:33:08.960 --> 1:33:10.960]  it's Alex Jones
[1:33:14.960 --> 1:33:16.960]  as you can see in here
[1:33:16.960 --> 1:33:18.960]  he's a very eloquent smart
[1:33:18.960 --> 1:33:20.960]  individual and we should try to get him on more often
[1:33:20.960 --> 1:33:22.960]  he's a busy guy hard to get on
[1:33:22.960 --> 1:33:24.960]  John Henry Weston life site
[1:33:24.960 --> 1:33:26.960]  news.com I want to just say this
[1:33:26.960 --> 1:33:28.960]  he got caught off by the break
[1:33:28.960 --> 1:33:30.960]  wanted to tell that story over again because
[1:33:30.960 --> 1:33:32.960]  it was bringing tears to my eyes and his as well
[1:33:32.960 --> 1:33:34.960]  and I think it leads into my next question
[1:33:34.960 --> 1:33:36.960]  I don't want to really try to not be so excited
[1:33:36.960 --> 1:33:38.960]  and give him the floor to cover other key aspects
[1:33:38.960 --> 1:33:40.960]  he's one of the leading experts in the world
[1:33:40.960 --> 1:33:42.960]  on the pro-life movement now it ties into everything
[1:33:42.960 --> 1:33:44.960]  and this battle
[1:33:44.960 --> 1:33:46.960]  between good versus evil
[1:33:46.960 --> 1:33:48.960]  but I think you were expanding into the fact that
[1:33:48.960 --> 1:33:50.960]  people who invested time, energy
[1:33:50.960 --> 1:33:52.960]  their will, people who have been sent to prison
[1:33:52.960 --> 1:33:54.960]  for peacefully protesting
[1:33:54.960 --> 1:33:56.960]  this is a big win but the
[1:33:56.960 --> 1:33:58.960]  real battle to win the war
[1:33:58.960 --> 1:34:00.960]  is now just starting
[1:34:00.960 --> 1:34:02.960]  if we just hold the line and install their venom
[1:34:02.960 --> 1:34:04.960]  and hate and violence
[1:34:04.960 --> 1:34:06.960]  we're going to see a huge revival
[1:34:06.960 --> 1:34:08.960]  coming out of this and you can already see it
[1:34:08.960 --> 1:34:10.960]  so we've just got to hold the line but please
[1:34:10.960 --> 1:34:12.960]  finish your story, elaborate on that and then other facts
[1:34:12.960 --> 1:34:14.960]  that you'd like to get into
[1:34:14.960 --> 1:34:16.960]  so the story really
[1:34:16.960 --> 1:34:18.960]  is of
[1:34:18.960 --> 1:34:20.960]  Norma McCorvey the role of Roe V. Wade
[1:34:20.960 --> 1:34:22.960]  who after she was used
[1:34:22.960 --> 1:34:24.960]  by abortion supporters
[1:34:24.960 --> 1:34:26.960]  to do this law
[1:34:26.960 --> 1:34:28.960]  in 1973 and just
[1:34:28.960 --> 1:34:30.960]  the horror of it that affected her
[1:34:30.960 --> 1:34:32.960]  for the rest of her life and she eventually
[1:34:32.960 --> 1:34:34.960]  was converted
[1:34:34.960 --> 1:34:36.960]  to be pro-life then to be a Christian
[1:34:36.960 --> 1:34:38.960]  and finally she worked
[1:34:38.960 --> 1:34:40.960]  as a Catholic with priests for life
[1:34:40.960 --> 1:34:42.960]  and also Silent No More
[1:34:42.960 --> 1:34:44.960]  Silent No More an organization of women
[1:34:44.960 --> 1:34:46.960]  who had themselves had abortions
[1:34:46.960 --> 1:34:48.960]  and speak out now for life
[1:34:48.960 --> 1:34:50.960]  trying to get other women to avoid
[1:34:50.960 --> 1:34:52.960]  the damage that was caused them by abortion
[1:34:52.960 --> 1:34:54.960]  and so Norma
[1:34:54.960 --> 1:34:56.960]  as she was dying
[1:34:56.960 --> 1:34:58.960]  she held the hand of Janet Marana
[1:34:58.960 --> 1:35:00.960]  now the head of
[1:35:00.960 --> 1:35:02.960]  Silent No More
[1:35:02.960 --> 1:35:04.960]  and
[1:35:04.960 --> 1:35:06.960]  basically begged Father Frank Pavone
[1:35:06.960 --> 1:35:08.960]  and Janet Marana
[1:35:08.960 --> 1:35:10.960]  to see to it
[1:35:10.960 --> 1:35:12.960]  that the end of Roe V. Wade
[1:35:12.960 --> 1:35:14.960]  would happen and
[1:35:14.960 --> 1:35:16.960]  I texted them on Friday
[1:35:16.960 --> 1:35:18.960]  to tell them that
[1:35:18.960 --> 1:35:20.960]  indeed promised fulfilled is what you can tell
[1:35:20.960 --> 1:35:22.960]  Norma now as she's in the afterlife
[1:35:22.960 --> 1:35:24.960]  That is powerful
[1:35:24.960 --> 1:35:26.960]  Again
[1:35:26.960 --> 1:35:28.960]  I've got a lot of questions here John Henry
[1:35:28.960 --> 1:35:30.960]  but what other areas
[1:35:30.960 --> 1:35:32.960]  should we be aware of what should we be looking for
[1:35:32.960 --> 1:35:34.960]  what's the next leg of the battle
[1:35:34.960 --> 1:35:36.960]  looks to me like they're going to push
[1:35:36.960 --> 1:35:38.960]  mourning after pills and vending machines
[1:35:38.960 --> 1:35:40.960]  they're saying that's their plan is that something big to be watching
[1:35:40.960 --> 1:35:42.960]  Well it is indeed
[1:35:42.960 --> 1:35:44.960]  the fact
[1:35:44.960 --> 1:35:46.960]  of abortion being killing
[1:35:46.960 --> 1:35:48.960]  and child sacrifice
[1:35:48.960 --> 1:35:50.960]  is very real so that
[1:35:50.960 --> 1:35:52.960]  when they do it no matter how small
[1:35:52.960 --> 1:35:54.960]  the children are
[1:35:54.960 --> 1:35:56.960]  it's still abortion it's still killing babies
[1:35:56.960 --> 1:35:58.960]  and the effect on the people's souls
[1:35:58.960 --> 1:36:00.960]  is also still there
[1:36:00.960 --> 1:36:02.960]  so whether they're doing it by a morning
[1:36:02.960 --> 1:36:04.960]  after pill or the
[1:36:04.960 --> 1:36:06.960]  abortion pill the early abortion pill
[1:36:06.960 --> 1:36:08.960]  whatever they're using
[1:36:08.960 --> 1:36:10.960]  they're damaging now in addition to the
[1:36:10.960 --> 1:36:12.960]  spiritual harm that it causes the fact that you
[1:36:12.960 --> 1:36:14.960]  are engaging in murder and associating
[1:36:14.960 --> 1:36:16.960]  yourself with murder
[1:36:16.960 --> 1:36:18.960]  there is also the physical health consequences
[1:36:18.960 --> 1:36:20.960]  to the mother they take these drugs
[1:36:20.960 --> 1:36:22.960]  which are deadly
[1:36:22.960 --> 1:36:24.960]  and then they don't get the proper medical
[1:36:24.960 --> 1:36:26.960]  care afterward
[1:36:26.960 --> 1:36:28.960]  because very often
[1:36:28.960 --> 1:36:30.960]  abortionists are concerned basically
[1:36:30.960 --> 1:36:32.960]  about getting the job done in terms of killing
[1:36:32.960 --> 1:36:34.960]  the baby and as we've seen so many
[1:36:34.960 --> 1:36:36.960]  countless times
[1:36:36.960 --> 1:36:38.960]  they don't really give a care about the
[1:36:38.960 --> 1:36:40.960]  woman after the fact if she bleeds to death
[1:36:40.960 --> 1:36:42.960]  oh well that's on her
[1:36:42.960 --> 1:36:44.960]  it's unbelievable
[1:36:44.960 --> 1:36:46.960]  and who's there to pick up the pieces on
[1:36:46.960 --> 1:36:48.960]  the other side of abortion the pro-life
[1:36:48.960 --> 1:36:50.960]  movement as well
[1:36:50.960 --> 1:36:52.960]  so that's an incredible thing you can look at
[1:36:52.960 --> 1:36:54.960]  but what is coming up is yes that
[1:36:54.960 --> 1:36:56.960]  pushing but there's also
[1:36:56.960 --> 1:36:58.960]  the want to do it
[1:36:58.960 --> 1:37:00.960]  anyway
[1:37:00.960 --> 1:37:02.960]  I believe it was Senator Warren is talking about
[1:37:02.960 --> 1:37:04.960]  getting Biden to make for
[1:37:04.960 --> 1:37:06.960]  some kind of
[1:37:06.960 --> 1:37:08.960]  area inside the states
[1:37:08.960 --> 1:37:10.960]  where abortion is now illegal
[1:37:10.960 --> 1:37:12.960]  to do it anyway
[1:37:12.960 --> 1:37:14.960]  they're going to try anything
[1:37:14.960 --> 1:37:16.960]  by hook or by crook because again
[1:37:16.960 --> 1:37:18.960]  after them this is like a sacrament as you said
[1:37:18.960 --> 1:37:20.960]  and
[1:37:20.960 --> 1:37:22.960]  they might be deluded with this is a women's
[1:37:22.960 --> 1:37:24.960]  right and so on but what's coming out now
[1:37:24.960 --> 1:37:26.960]  with all of the violence
[1:37:26.960 --> 1:37:28.960]  and the extremity
[1:37:28.960 --> 1:37:30.960]  is many people will see it for what it really
[1:37:30.960 --> 1:37:32.960]  is and God willing
[1:37:32.960 --> 1:37:34.960]  we'll have more pushback
[1:37:34.960 --> 1:37:36.960]  so we'll see this this war fight
[1:37:36.960 --> 1:37:38.960]  out and it will be a war
[1:37:38.960 --> 1:37:40.960]  they've already shown
[1:37:40.960 --> 1:37:42.960]  that they will commit violence
[1:37:42.960 --> 1:37:44.960]  not only violence against children
[1:37:44.960 --> 1:37:46.960]  but also the fire bombing churches
[1:37:46.960 --> 1:37:48.960]  and pregnancy centers
[1:37:48.960 --> 1:37:50.960]  Jane's revenge that organization
[1:37:50.960 --> 1:37:52.960]  to somehow publicly threatening people
[1:37:52.960 --> 1:37:54.960]  talked about even how
[1:37:54.960 --> 1:37:56.960]  the next actions they take
[1:37:56.960 --> 1:37:58.960]  won't be as simple
[1:37:58.960 --> 1:38:00.960]  as cleaning up from a fire
[1:38:00.960 --> 1:38:02.960]  or some vandalism
[1:38:02.960 --> 1:38:04.960]  so they're talking about
[1:38:04.960 --> 1:38:06.960]  real actual harmful
[1:38:06.960 --> 1:38:08.960]  violence that might
[1:38:08.960 --> 1:38:10.960]  kill people who knows what
[1:38:10.960 --> 1:38:12.960]  they're talking about but this is very real
[1:38:12.960 --> 1:38:14.960]  and so we have
[1:38:14.960 --> 1:38:16.960]  to be ready for that
[1:38:16.960 --> 1:38:18.960]  on faith and reason which is one of the shows
[1:38:18.960 --> 1:38:20.960]  that life site puts out
[1:38:20.960 --> 1:38:22.960]  we spoke of how churches and
[1:38:22.960 --> 1:38:24.960]  pregnancy centers need to protect themselves
[1:38:24.960 --> 1:38:26.960]  churches for instance
[1:38:26.960 --> 1:38:28.960]  need to develop security teams
[1:38:28.960 --> 1:38:30.960]  we talked about how outside your church
[1:38:30.960 --> 1:38:32.960]  you might park a van with a security van
[1:38:32.960 --> 1:38:34.960]  outside a lot of churches
[1:38:34.960 --> 1:38:36.960]  are already doing this they're shutting down
[1:38:36.960 --> 1:38:38.960]  most entrances having people only enter
[1:38:38.960 --> 1:38:40.960]  through the one entrance so that ushers
[1:38:40.960 --> 1:38:42.960]  and your security team
[1:38:42.960 --> 1:38:44.960]  can be there and you know it's really neat
[1:38:44.960 --> 1:38:46.960]  you can involve
[1:38:46.960 --> 1:38:48.960]  all those young men
[1:38:48.960 --> 1:38:50.960]  those young men between the ages of 19
[1:38:50.960 --> 1:38:52.960]  and 25 who you very
[1:38:52.960 --> 1:38:54.960]  rarely see at church you know what they've got a job now
[1:38:54.960 --> 1:38:56.960]  they can put all of those
[1:38:56.960 --> 1:38:58.960]  muscles and their bigness to the test
[1:38:58.960 --> 1:39:00.960]  by the church needs protection
[1:39:00.960 --> 1:39:02.960]  your parents your grandparents need
[1:39:02.960 --> 1:39:04.960]  protection your little
[1:39:04.960 --> 1:39:06.960]  brothers and sisters or your nephews and nieces
[1:39:06.960 --> 1:39:08.960]  need protection
[1:39:08.960 --> 1:39:10.960]  come and stand there
[1:39:10.960 --> 1:39:12.960]  and protect the house of God
[1:39:12.960 --> 1:39:14.960]  at the same time they can hear
[1:39:14.960 --> 1:39:16.960]  the message of the Lord and they can come on
[1:39:16.960 --> 1:39:18.960]  side with the faith in Jesus Christ
[1:39:18.960 --> 1:39:20.960]  which will lead them to embrace life
[1:39:20.960 --> 1:39:22.960]  there's opportunity in all
[1:39:22.960 --> 1:39:24.960]  of this for us so even though
[1:39:24.960 --> 1:39:26.960]  yes there's hard times coming
[1:39:26.960 --> 1:39:28.960]  we need to pull up our bootstraps
[1:39:28.960 --> 1:39:30.960]  we need to work really hard
[1:39:30.960 --> 1:39:32.960]  we have an opportunity now to
[1:39:32.960 --> 1:39:34.960]  save lives and to work now in
[1:39:34.960 --> 1:39:36.960]  the state legislatures
[1:39:36.960 --> 1:39:38.960]  to get to the point where we can elect
[1:39:38.960 --> 1:39:40.960]  pro-life representatives
[1:39:40.960 --> 1:39:42.960]  and that's why as you keep
[1:39:42.960 --> 1:39:44.960]  saying to make sure
[1:39:44.960 --> 1:39:46.960]  elections are fair
[1:39:46.960 --> 1:39:48.960]  and properly run is so key
[1:39:48.960 --> 1:39:50.960]  to what we're going to see in November
[1:39:50.960 --> 1:39:52.960]  expanding on that
[1:39:52.960 --> 1:39:54.960]  I mean you track all this at
[1:39:54.960 --> 1:39:56.960]  Lifesite News but it doesn't
[1:39:56.960 --> 1:39:58.960]  make national news but every day antipose
[1:39:58.960 --> 1:40:00.960]  attacking a pregnancy center
[1:40:00.960 --> 1:40:02.960]  every day they're attacking another church
[1:40:02.960 --> 1:40:04.960]  and I see countless videos
[1:40:04.960 --> 1:40:06.960]  in even in DC of the left
[1:40:06.960 --> 1:40:08.960]  just randomly go pick a Catholic church
[1:40:08.960 --> 1:40:10.960]  and go inside for breaking stuff
[1:40:10.960 --> 1:40:12.960]  or screaming at people and just doing
[1:40:12.960 --> 1:40:14.960]  all this psychotic stuff I mean
[1:40:14.960 --> 1:40:16.960]  they literally hate God they hate churches
[1:40:16.960 --> 1:40:18.960]  they see it as the enemy
[1:40:18.960 --> 1:40:20.960]  and even in jurisdictions where abortion
[1:40:20.960 --> 1:40:22.960]  is still legal they go attack the police
[1:40:22.960 --> 1:40:24.960]  I mean they're just frothing
[1:40:24.960 --> 1:40:26.960]  with hatred and the things they say
[1:40:26.960 --> 1:40:28.960]  the things they do we can't even put on air
[1:40:28.960 --> 1:40:30.960]  I mean just it's unspeakable
[1:40:30.960 --> 1:40:32.960]  that they think this is going to sell
[1:40:32.960 --> 1:40:34.960]  everyone on the practice
[1:40:34.960 --> 1:40:36.960]  of killing children when they are our best
[1:40:36.960 --> 1:40:38.960]  advertising against them I know I keep going back
[1:40:38.960 --> 1:40:40.960]  to that but that's what you predicted
[1:40:40.960 --> 1:40:42.960]  would happen that's what the Bible tells
[1:40:42.960 --> 1:40:44.960]  us would happen that's why we know
[1:40:44.960 --> 1:40:46.960]  as these end times come it will
[1:40:46.960 --> 1:40:48.960]  we'll see the biggest revival ever
[1:40:48.960 --> 1:40:50.960]  on earth so yeah the antichrist
[1:40:50.960 --> 1:40:52.960]  wins for a season but then that's actually
[1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:54.960]  the war that the devil loses
[1:40:54.960 --> 1:40:56.960]  it's an amazing
[1:40:56.960 --> 1:40:58.960]  thing you know how
[1:40:58.960 --> 1:41:00.960]  is it that even when so many
[1:41:00.960 --> 1:41:02.960]  church leaders
[1:41:02.960 --> 1:41:04.960]  have really lost their way
[1:41:04.960 --> 1:41:06.960]  they've basically gone into democratic camp
[1:41:06.960 --> 1:41:08.960]  they hardly ever talk about
[1:41:08.960 --> 1:41:10.960]  abortion at all they're
[1:41:10.960 --> 1:41:12.960]  you know they're trying to be on the
[1:41:12.960 --> 1:41:14.960]  up and up with everything not
[1:41:14.960 --> 1:41:16.960]  condemning LGBT anything
[1:41:16.960 --> 1:41:18.960]  sometimes even participating in private
[1:41:18.960 --> 1:41:20.960]  it's total insanity
[1:41:20.960 --> 1:41:22.960]  and yet
[1:41:22.960 --> 1:41:24.960]  the devil still sees the church
[1:41:24.960 --> 1:41:26.960]  as the enemy
[1:41:26.960 --> 1:41:28.960]  and therefore gets the people
[1:41:28.960 --> 1:41:30.960]  he has in his clutches
[1:41:30.960 --> 1:41:32.960]  to go and protest in
[1:41:32.960 --> 1:41:34.960]  why are they protesting in Catholic churches
[1:41:34.960 --> 1:41:36.960]  why are women basically
[1:41:36.960 --> 1:41:38.960]  going nudes with slogans of
[1:41:38.960 --> 1:41:40.960]  the need for abortion
[1:41:40.960 --> 1:41:42.960]  in Catholic churches
[1:41:42.960 --> 1:41:44.960]  what are they doing
[1:41:44.960 --> 1:41:46.960]  it's disturbing as heck for sure
[1:41:46.960 --> 1:41:48.960]  but it's also demonstrating
[1:41:48.960 --> 1:41:50.960]  a couple things one for all
[1:41:50.960 --> 1:41:52.960]  the mushy middle
[1:41:52.960 --> 1:41:54.960]  sheesh those
[1:41:54.960 --> 1:41:56.960]  this is what we're fighting for this is
[1:41:56.960 --> 1:41:58.960]  the right to
[1:41:58.960 --> 1:42:00.960]  women's choice this is
[1:42:00.960 --> 1:42:02.960]  really evil
[1:42:02.960 --> 1:42:04.960]  and then also
[1:42:04.960 --> 1:42:06.960]  it convinces
[1:42:06.960 --> 1:42:08.960]  the people
[1:42:08.960 --> 1:42:10.960]  that wait a minute this is satanic
[1:42:10.960 --> 1:42:12.960]  and we need to wake up
[1:42:12.960 --> 1:42:14.960]  and I think that's
[1:42:14.960 --> 1:42:16.960]  part of the effort here the need
[1:42:16.960 --> 1:42:18.960]  to wake up the whole
[1:42:18.960 --> 1:42:20.960]  middle ground so they can see this for
[1:42:20.960 --> 1:42:22.960]  what it is and that's happening now
[1:42:22.960 --> 1:42:24.960]  and the media of course
[1:42:24.960 --> 1:42:26.960]  is playing its game it's unwilling
[1:42:26.960 --> 1:42:28.960]  to cover as of already
[1:42:28.960 --> 1:42:30.960]  last week we had over
[1:42:30.960 --> 1:42:32.960]  23 crisis pregnancy centers
[1:42:32.960 --> 1:42:34.960]  fire bombed and vandalized
[1:42:34.960 --> 1:42:36.960]  and destroyed
[1:42:36.960 --> 1:42:38.960]  and there's more of that happening
[1:42:38.960 --> 1:42:40.960]  every single day check out
[1:42:40.960 --> 1:42:42.960]  you'll see it report by report by report
[1:42:42.960 --> 1:42:44.960]  you're seeing the same thing
[1:42:44.960 --> 1:42:46.960]  at Catholic churches at Christian churches

[1:43:50.960 --> 1:43:52.960]  against the new world order because the answer to
[1:43:52.960 --> 1:43:54.960]  1984 is 17
[1:43:54.960 --> 1:43:56.960]  76
[1:44:00.960 --> 1:44:02.960]  our great
[1:44:02.960 --> 1:44:04.960]  I mean this is from people say
[1:44:04.960 --> 1:44:06.960]  why is it from Chiapas, Mexico
[1:44:06.960 --> 1:44:08.960]  the communist well that's where some of the best
[1:44:08.960 --> 1:44:10.960]  coffee in the world that's wild harvested
[1:44:10.960 --> 1:44:12.960]  above organic in the volcanic
[1:44:12.960 --> 1:44:14.960]  soil better than watermelon coffee and yeah
[1:44:14.960 --> 1:44:16.960]  we buy it from the little farmers
[1:44:16.960 --> 1:44:18.960]  the media calls communist but really they're just a commune
[1:44:18.960 --> 1:44:20.960]  and whatever the point is is that it's good coffee
[1:44:20.960 --> 1:44:22.960]  and we've got it and the farmers
[1:44:22.960 --> 1:44:24.960]  don't let the Mexican government take over
[1:44:24.960 --> 1:44:26.960]  so I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels
[1:44:26.960 --> 1:44:28.960]  and I've been buying it for what 14 years and the price has never gone up
[1:44:28.960 --> 1:44:30.960]  the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name
[1:44:30.960 --> 1:44:32.960]  for about 50% more per pound
[1:44:32.960 --> 1:44:34.960]  and I just think it's some of the best coffee
[1:44:34.960 --> 1:44:36.960]  you're going to find anywhere it's wake up America
[1:44:36.960 --> 1:44:38.960]  patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels
[1:44:38.960 --> 1:44:40.960]  literally
[1:44:40.960 --> 1:44:42.960]  I'm going to tell you a little story
[1:44:42.960 --> 1:44:44.960]  from

[1:44:58.960 --> 1:45:00.960]  a lot of listeners have told us it's hard

[1:45:22.960 --> 1:45:24.960]  with global food shortages
[1:45:24.960 --> 1:45:26.960]  I told you over two years ago
[1:45:26.960 --> 1:45:28.960]  the global is going to have massive inflation
[1:45:28.960 --> 1:45:30.960]  and food shortages and it's happened
[1:45:30.960 --> 1:45:32.960]  just like clockwork and I'm telling you
[1:45:32.960 --> 1:45:34.960]  it's going to get a lot worse

[1:46:32.960 --> 1:46:34.960]  with the collapse and wars
[1:46:34.960 --> 1:46:36.960]  is one of the most important things you can make
[1:46:36.960 --> 1:46:38.960]  is to have high quality storeable food

[1:46:50.960 --> 1:46:52.960]  I would not procrastinate
[1:46:52.960 --> 1:46:54.960]  ladies and gentlemen one of the most important things you can do
[1:46:54.960 --> 1:46:56.960]  is get ahead of inflation now
[1:46:56.960 --> 1:46:58.960]  because inflation is just beginning
[1:46:58.960 --> 1:47:00.960]  Leading a frontal assault
[1:47:00.960 --> 1:47:02.960]  on the lies of the New World Order
[1:47:02.960 --> 1:47:04.960]  it's Alex Jones
[1:47:18.960 --> 1:47:20.960]  last time John Henry
[1:47:20.960 --> 1:47:22.960]  was here with us
[1:47:22.960 --> 1:47:24.960]  and I don't tell it because I'm
[1:47:24.960 --> 1:47:26.960]  proud of what I was involved in
[1:47:26.960 --> 1:47:28.960]  I tell it because
[1:47:28.960 --> 1:47:30.960]  it's really a redemption story
[1:47:30.960 --> 1:47:32.960]  I was brought up a Christian and I had a relationship with God
[1:47:32.960 --> 1:47:34.960]  but I was promiscuous
[1:47:34.960 --> 1:47:36.960]  as a teenager
[1:47:36.960 --> 1:47:38.960]  and it felt very empty
[1:47:38.960 --> 1:47:40.960]  and I was depressed over it
[1:47:40.960 --> 1:47:42.960]  but I was still doing it
[1:47:42.960 --> 1:47:44.960]  and my dad confronted me and he said
[1:47:44.960 --> 1:47:46.960]  I know you're out there getting girls pregnant
[1:47:46.960 --> 1:47:48.960]  and paying for abortions
[1:47:48.960 --> 1:47:50.960]  because I got one of the girls over the house
[1:47:50.960 --> 1:47:52.960]  and my mom did
[1:47:52.960 --> 1:47:54.960]  and
[1:47:54.960 --> 1:47:56.960]  she was like 17 or 18 like I was
[1:47:56.960 --> 1:47:58.960]  and my dad said quick kill on my grandkids
[1:47:58.960 --> 1:48:00.960]  and he said
[1:48:00.960 --> 1:48:02.960]  you're going to wreck your life
[1:48:02.960 --> 1:48:04.960]  and wreck all these futures
[1:48:04.960 --> 1:48:06.960]  stop it
[1:48:06.960 --> 1:48:08.960]  and I remember over the next year
[1:48:08.960 --> 1:48:10.960]  being convicted by that and then praying to God
[1:48:10.960 --> 1:48:12.960]  to forgive me
[1:48:12.960 --> 1:48:14.960]  and it was like
[1:48:14.960 --> 1:48:16.960]  it was lifted off of me not even some subconscious guilt
[1:48:16.960 --> 1:48:18.960]  that I wasn't a happy person
[1:48:18.960 --> 1:48:20.960]  because of what I was involved in
[1:48:20.960 --> 1:48:22.960]  and this means I'm perfect today
[1:48:22.960 --> 1:48:24.960]  the point is I'm sure it's
[1:48:24.960 --> 1:48:26.960]  going to have abortions
[1:48:26.960 --> 1:48:28.960]  but people once they've had abortions
[1:48:28.960 --> 1:48:30.960]  they harden their heart
[1:48:30.960 --> 1:48:32.960]  and they get more and more evil until they turn into these devils
[1:48:32.960 --> 1:48:34.960]  and if I had told my dad
[1:48:34.960 --> 1:48:36.960]  no I'm not going to listen to you and keep doing that
[1:48:36.960 --> 1:48:38.960]  I'd probably be a devil worshiper today
[1:48:38.960 --> 1:48:40.960]  I mean that's the path you're on
[1:48:40.960 --> 1:48:42.960]  you've got to be on the path and I'm telling people
[1:48:42.960 --> 1:48:44.960]  you can break away from that path
[1:48:44.960 --> 1:48:46.960]  and you'll be so fulfilled and so empowered
[1:48:46.960 --> 1:48:48.960]  you'll be on your knees and say I repent God
[1:48:48.960 --> 1:48:50.960]  come into me help me be good
[1:48:50.960 --> 1:48:52.960]  put me on the right path and it's a process
[1:48:52.960 --> 1:48:54.960]  and then life is so much more fulfilling
[1:48:54.960 --> 1:48:56.960]  so much more powerful
[1:48:56.960 --> 1:48:58.960]  and these people are looking for power from Satan
[1:48:58.960 --> 1:49:00.960]  getting on your knees to Christ
[1:49:00.960 --> 1:49:02.960]  that's what the real power is and I wanted to get your view on that
[1:49:02.960 --> 1:49:04.960]  No
[1:49:04.960 --> 1:49:06.960]  well it's absolutely
[1:49:06.960 --> 1:49:08.960]  nothing truer than that
[1:49:08.960 --> 1:49:10.960]  I too come from a very simple past
[1:49:10.960 --> 1:49:12.960]  involved in all sorts of
[1:49:12.960 --> 1:49:14.960]  very similar things
[1:49:14.960 --> 1:49:16.960]  and what
[1:49:16.960 --> 1:49:18.960]  led me to
[1:49:18.960 --> 1:49:20.960]  this was first of all the recognition
[1:49:20.960 --> 1:49:22.960]  that this stuff is real
[1:49:22.960 --> 1:49:24.960]  that the faith is real
[1:49:24.960 --> 1:49:26.960]  in fact it came out of the example
[1:49:26.960 --> 1:49:28.960]  of my dad a daily mass
[1:49:28.960 --> 1:49:30.960]  daily rosary catholic
[1:49:30.960 --> 1:49:32.960]  but it wasn't just his example
[1:49:32.960 --> 1:49:34.960]  of doing that of spending all this
[1:49:34.960 --> 1:49:36.960]  life praying and gosh
[1:49:36.960 --> 1:49:38.960]  I would come home from going to dance clubs
[1:49:38.960 --> 1:49:40.960]  two in the morning still be there praying at his bedside
[1:49:40.960 --> 1:49:42.960]  sometimes falling asleep and kneeling
[1:49:42.960 --> 1:49:44.960]  but sleeping on the bed
[1:49:44.960 --> 1:49:46.960]  really what affected me even more
[1:49:46.960 --> 1:49:48.960]  than that was the persecution
[1:49:48.960 --> 1:49:50.960]  he received for being that way
[1:49:50.960 --> 1:49:52.960]  his family
[1:49:52.960 --> 1:49:54.960]  members myself and my siblings
[1:49:54.960 --> 1:49:56.960]  included his own spouse
[1:49:56.960 --> 1:49:58.960]  his family his mom and his siblings
[1:49:58.960 --> 1:50:00.960]  his colleagues at work
[1:50:00.960 --> 1:50:02.960]  all calling him extreme
[1:50:02.960 --> 1:50:04.960]  or a freak whatever
[1:50:04.960 --> 1:50:06.960]  for being so religious
[1:50:06.960 --> 1:50:08.960]  and you know what he did anyway
[1:50:08.960 --> 1:50:10.960]  he loved Christ it was all
[1:50:10.960 --> 1:50:12.960]  about love
[1:50:12.960 --> 1:50:14.960]  and you know
[1:50:14.960 --> 1:50:16.960]  that persecution he received for being faithful
[1:50:16.960 --> 1:50:18.960]  that persecution he received for loving Christ
[1:50:18.960 --> 1:50:20.960]  above all else
[1:50:20.960 --> 1:50:22.960]  was what told me it was real more than any words
[1:50:22.960 --> 1:50:24.960]  he could have said
[1:50:24.960 --> 1:50:26.960]  and so I was able to embrace Christ
[1:50:26.960 --> 1:50:28.960]  myself thanks to his example
[1:50:28.960 --> 1:50:30.960]  and it
[1:50:30.960 --> 1:50:32.960]  gives you the greatest joy
[1:50:32.960 --> 1:50:34.960]  it's an incredible thing
[1:50:34.960 --> 1:50:36.960]  and it leads us to
[1:50:36.960 --> 1:50:38.960]  also recognize
[1:50:38.960 --> 1:50:40.960]  where the world is at
[1:50:40.960 --> 1:50:42.960]  and work for the world's redemption because
[1:50:42.960 --> 1:50:44.960]  all of these people
[1:50:44.960 --> 1:50:46.960]  all of these people even those
[1:50:46.960 --> 1:50:48.960]  on the other side even the ones
[1:50:48.960 --> 1:50:50.960]  performing
[1:50:50.960 --> 1:50:52.960]  the abortions are still
[1:50:52.960 --> 1:50:54.960]  children of God and there's still a chance
[1:50:54.960 --> 1:50:56.960]  till they die to reach them
[1:50:56.960 --> 1:50:58.960]  perhaps we can't
[1:50:58.960 --> 1:51:00.960]  but it doesn't stop us from trying
[1:51:00.960 --> 1:51:02.960]  and so
[1:51:02.960 --> 1:51:04.960]  we don't hate
[1:51:04.960 --> 1:51:06.960]  the people who are on the other side
[1:51:06.960 --> 1:51:08.960]  we actually love them that's right
[1:51:08.960 --> 1:51:10.960]  we try and reach out to them
[1:51:10.960 --> 1:51:12.960]  and that's why such a big movement
[1:51:12.960 --> 1:51:14.960]  is in the pro-life movement
[1:51:14.960 --> 1:51:16.960]  to reach out to those on the other side
[1:51:16.960 --> 1:51:18.960]  those committing abortions assisting it
[1:51:18.960 --> 1:51:20.960]  who is Abby Johnson one of the greatest
[1:51:20.960 --> 1:51:22.960]  pro-life leaders that exists in the world today
[1:51:22.960 --> 1:51:24.960]  who was she she headed up
[1:51:24.960 --> 1:51:26.960]  planned parenthood clinics
[1:51:26.960 --> 1:51:28.960]  and she knows the inside story
[1:51:28.960 --> 1:51:30.960]  and now she runs an organization
[1:51:30.960 --> 1:51:32.960]  which seeks to convert and has converted
[1:51:32.960 --> 1:51:34.960]  many many abortion workers
[1:51:34.960 --> 1:51:36.960]  and it's so beautiful
[1:51:36.960 --> 1:51:38.960]  speaking to that
[1:51:38.960 --> 1:51:40.960]  this supreme court is doing
[1:51:40.960 --> 1:51:42.960]  so many other great things but the reason
[1:51:42.960 --> 1:51:44.960]  they're accelerating the censorship
[1:51:44.960 --> 1:51:46.960]  it's come out from some of the big tech leaks
[1:51:46.960 --> 1:51:48.960]  as you know is the gathering
[1:51:48.960 --> 1:51:50.960]  steam of the pro-life movement
[1:51:50.960 --> 1:51:52.960]  through free speech and so
[1:51:52.960 --> 1:51:54.960]  sure they wanted to target Alex Jones and Donald Trump
[1:51:54.960 --> 1:51:56.960]  but they're really going after
[1:51:56.960 --> 1:51:58.960]  the movement that is
[1:51:58.960 --> 1:52:00.960]  showing people hey these are really babies
[1:52:00.960 --> 1:52:02.960]  this is really a satanic movement
[1:52:02.960 --> 1:52:04.960]  and that's why this newest supreme court ruling
[1:52:04.960 --> 1:52:06.960]  is really good
[1:52:06.960 --> 1:52:08.960]  a bunch more they say are going to come out in the next few days
[1:52:08.960 --> 1:52:10.960]  supreme court says high school football coach
[1:52:10.960 --> 1:52:12.960]  can pray at the 50 yard line
[1:52:12.960 --> 1:52:14.960]  yes we don't have a state run religion
[1:52:14.960 --> 1:52:16.960]  we have religious freedom in America
[1:52:16.960 --> 1:52:18.960]  but I can hand out Christmas cards
[1:52:18.960 --> 1:52:20.960]  or I can pray with people if they want to
[1:52:20.960 --> 1:52:22.960]  or I as a valedictorian
[1:52:22.960 --> 1:52:24.960]  I wasn't a valedictorian but I could say a prayer
[1:52:24.960 --> 1:52:26.960]  but even when I was a senior
[1:52:26.960 --> 1:52:28.960]  in high school 30 something years ago they told us don't
[1:52:28.960 --> 1:52:30.960]  don't say any prayers
[1:52:30.960 --> 1:52:32.960]  if you say anything
[1:52:32.960 --> 1:52:34.960]  at your graduation
[1:52:34.960 --> 1:52:36.960]  and
[1:52:36.960 --> 1:52:38.960]  the football team you can't pray in public
[1:52:38.960 --> 1:52:40.960]  the coach can't pray at the huddle
[1:52:40.960 --> 1:52:42.960]  that is tyranny we individually can do whatever we want
[1:52:42.960 --> 1:52:44.960]  that's the first amendment
[1:52:44.960 --> 1:52:46.960]  the first amendment defends that and finally the supreme court
[1:52:46.960 --> 1:52:48.960]  said stop it that's another big victory
[1:52:48.960 --> 1:52:50.960]  it is
[1:52:50.960 --> 1:52:52.960]  absolutely because
[1:52:52.960 --> 1:52:54.960]  this is the thing if we remove
[1:52:54.960 --> 1:52:56.960]  Christ from the public square
[1:52:56.960 --> 1:52:58.960]  obviously people who should be able
[1:52:58.960 --> 1:53:00.960]  to see the good example
[1:53:00.960 --> 1:53:02.960]  Christians are giving
[1:53:02.960 --> 1:53:04.960]  that's withdrawn from them
[1:53:04.960 --> 1:53:06.960]  that's crazy
[1:53:06.960 --> 1:53:08.960]  we see all of the mother Teresa
[1:53:08.960 --> 1:53:10.960]  of this world if she's never allowed
[1:53:10.960 --> 1:53:12.960]  to express her faith people just think
[1:53:12.960 --> 1:53:14.960]  oh what a great wonderful woman
[1:53:14.960 --> 1:53:16.960]  that's not what she wanted
[1:53:16.960 --> 1:53:18.960]  she didn't want to be known as a great wonderful woman
[1:53:18.960 --> 1:53:20.960]  she wanted to be known as the
[1:53:20.960 --> 1:53:22.960]  hands and feet of Jesus
[1:53:22.960 --> 1:53:24.960]  we're here to serve you and to love you
[1:53:24.960 --> 1:53:26.960]  and to reach out to you and invite you
[1:53:26.960 --> 1:53:28.960]  to an eternal relationship
[1:53:28.960 --> 1:53:30.960]  with Jesus that's what it's all about
[1:53:30.960 --> 1:53:32.960]  and if we're forbidden from doing that
[1:53:32.960 --> 1:53:34.960]  it so
[1:53:34.960 --> 1:53:36.960]  deprives the world so this is an amazing
[1:53:36.960 --> 1:53:38.960]  supreme court victory
[1:53:38.960 --> 1:53:40.960]  and all of this is coming
[1:53:40.960 --> 1:53:42.960]  too ahead
[1:53:42.960 --> 1:53:44.960]  because the whole battle in life is all
[1:53:44.960 --> 1:53:46.960]  about this it's actually
[1:53:46.960 --> 1:53:48.960]  all about eternal life
[1:53:48.960 --> 1:53:50.960]  you know we're here for even if we're here for 100 years
[1:53:50.960 --> 1:53:52.960]  that is a blip
[1:53:52.960 --> 1:53:54.960]  on the screen compared to eternity
[1:53:54.960 --> 1:53:56.960]  but in that blip
[1:53:56.960 --> 1:53:58.960]  you're going to decide
[1:53:58.960 --> 1:54:00.960]  where you spend all of eternity
[1:54:00.960 --> 1:54:02.960]  for millions and billions of years
[1:54:02.960 --> 1:54:04.960]  in the shortest period of time
[1:54:04.960 --> 1:54:06.960]  you've got to make that decision
[1:54:06.960 --> 1:54:08.960]  and that's why the elites
[1:54:08.960 --> 1:54:10.960]  are all gathering to fight
[1:54:10.960 --> 1:54:12.960]  all the same agendas you mentioned before the break
[1:54:12.960 --> 1:54:14.960]  how does all this work together
[1:54:14.960 --> 1:54:16.960]  it does look
[1:54:16.960 --> 1:54:18.960]  the same temptation that
[1:54:18.960 --> 1:54:20.960]  Satan always had
[1:54:20.960 --> 1:54:22.960]  that he gave to Adam and Eve
[1:54:22.960 --> 1:54:24.960]  to take power to take the place of God
[1:54:24.960 --> 1:54:26.960]  to be God's yourself
[1:54:26.960 --> 1:54:28.960]  is given especially to the elites of this world
[1:54:28.960 --> 1:54:30.960]  take the power
[1:54:30.960 --> 1:54:32.960]  and lord it over everyone
[1:54:32.960 --> 1:54:34.960]  and what do they do well
[1:54:34.960 --> 1:54:36.960]  they say as you know
[1:54:36.960 --> 1:54:38.960]  and you've said from
[1:54:38.960 --> 1:54:40.960]  for over 20 years
[1:54:40.960 --> 1:54:42.960]  the elites want to control the population of the world
[1:54:42.960 --> 1:54:44.960]  they want to bring it down to what 500,000 or so
[1:54:44.960 --> 1:54:46.960]  excuse me
[1:54:46.960 --> 1:54:48.960]  500 million or so why
[1:54:48.960 --> 1:54:50.960]  why 500 million because it's controllable
[1:54:50.960 --> 1:54:52.960]  and how do they get there
[1:54:52.960 --> 1:54:54.960]  well population control
[1:54:54.960 --> 1:54:56.960]  well how do we do population control
[1:54:56.960 --> 1:54:58.960]  well contraception and the first thing that did
[1:54:58.960 --> 1:55:00.960]  was it decoupled the link
[1:55:00.960 --> 1:55:02.960]  between sexuality and procreation
[1:55:02.960 --> 1:55:04.960]  which is absolutely essential
[1:55:04.960 --> 1:55:06.960]  why sexuality was created
[1:55:06.960 --> 1:55:08.960]  for procreation then what did they do
[1:55:08.960 --> 1:55:10.960]  they destabilize marriage because they know
[1:55:10.960 --> 1:55:12.960]  that's the building block of society
[1:55:12.960 --> 1:55:14.960]  and that is what keeps families
[1:55:14.960 --> 1:55:16.960]  grounded and they don't want children grounded
[1:55:16.960 --> 1:55:18.960]  they want them subsidiaries of the state
[1:55:18.960 --> 1:55:20.960]  so they attack marriage
[1:55:20.960 --> 1:55:22.960]  and then they attack
[1:55:22.960 --> 1:55:24.960]  life itself both
[1:55:24.960 --> 1:55:26.960]  in early term and late term
[1:55:26.960 --> 1:55:28.960]  abortion and so all of this
[1:55:28.960 --> 1:55:30.960]  works together and of course
[1:55:30.960 --> 1:55:32.960]  homosexuality is sexuality
[1:55:32.960 --> 1:55:34.960]  apart from procreation as well
[1:55:34.960 --> 1:55:36.960]  and so now they got the transgenderism
[1:55:36.960 --> 1:55:38.960]  to sterilize the children
[1:55:38.960 --> 1:55:40.960]  it's all about decoupling us from God's order
[1:55:40.960 --> 1:55:42.960]  making us basically
[1:55:42.960 --> 1:55:44.960]  domesticated corporate commodities
[1:55:44.960 --> 1:55:46.960]  you can see the cold bloodedness of this
[1:55:46.960 --> 1:55:48.960]  absolutely and with
[1:55:48.960 --> 1:55:50.960]  COVID came
[1:55:50.960 --> 1:55:52.960]  a forwarding of this agenda
[1:55:52.960 --> 1:55:54.960]  was very hard to see in the past
[1:55:54.960 --> 1:55:56.960]  how could we fast forward this
[1:55:56.960 --> 1:55:58.960]  so fast to get us to a point
[1:55:58.960 --> 1:56:00.960]  where we'll all be subjected
[1:56:00.960 --> 1:56:02.960]  to a tyranny almost immediately
[1:56:02.960 --> 1:56:04.960]  and it worked
[1:56:04.960 --> 1:56:06.960]  they shut down churches
[1:56:06.960 --> 1:56:08.960]  they made you stay in your home
[1:56:08.960 --> 1:56:10.960]  they forced you to get an abortion tamed to jab
[1:56:10.960 --> 1:56:12.960]  under pain of losing your job
[1:56:12.960 --> 1:56:14.960]  your livelihood or being unable to see
[1:56:14.960 --> 1:56:16.960]  your parents dying in the hospital
[1:56:16.960 --> 1:56:18.960]  and being unable to get treatment
[1:56:18.960 --> 1:56:20.960]  in a hospital for
[1:56:20.960 --> 1:56:22.960]  whatever disorder you may have
[1:56:22.960 --> 1:56:24.960]  life threatening doesn't matter
[1:56:24.960 --> 1:56:26.960]  you need to get this abortion tamed to jab
[1:56:26.960 --> 1:56:28.960]  otherwise we're not going to treat you
[1:56:28.960 --> 1:56:30.960]  and it was done, it all happened
[1:56:30.960 --> 1:56:32.960]  that's right, we're out of time
[1:56:32.960 --> 1:56:34.960]  I want to close this John Henry West
[1:56:34.960 --> 1:56:36.960]  with this
[1:56:36.960 --> 1:56:38.960]  even the Daily Mail
[1:56:38.960 --> 1:56:40.960]  even the London Telegraph
[1:56:40.960 --> 1:56:42.960]  even the Associated Press run this video
[1:56:42.960 --> 1:56:44.960]  it makes it into the egg
[1:56:44.960 --> 1:56:46.960]  there's an electrochemical explosion
[1:56:46.960 --> 1:56:48.960]  they can't even describe
[1:56:48.960 --> 1:56:50.960]  because that's literally the new life
[1:56:50.960 --> 1:56:52.960]  the new entity with a spiritual connection
[1:56:52.960 --> 1:56:54.960]  to the higher dimensions of God
[1:56:54.960 --> 1:56:56.960]  being activated and scientists
[1:56:56.960 --> 1:56:58.960]  don't know why this happens
[1:56:58.960 --> 1:57:00.960]  there it is, right there
[1:57:00.960 --> 1:57:02.960]  an explosion of energy
[1:57:02.960 --> 1:57:04.960]  when those things come together
[1:57:04.960 --> 1:57:06.960]  we are magic, God made us
[1:57:06.960 --> 1:57:08.960]  we have a special
[1:57:08.960 --> 1:57:10.960]  a destiny and to deny that
[1:57:10.960 --> 1:57:12.960]  Lord's over us and pretend to be God
[1:57:12.960 --> 1:57:14.960]  when it's all a fraud, thank you so much
[1:57:14.960 --> 1:57:16.960]  congratulations on your hard work
[1:57:16.960 --> 1:57:18.960]  please congratulate your whole team
[1:57:18.960 --> 1:57:20.960]  thank you so much sir
[1:57:20.960 --> 1:57:22.960]  thank you Alex, God bless you
[1:57:22.960 --> 1:57:24.960]  that was a powerful interview
[1:57:24.960 --> 1:57:26.960]  look, I got a ton of news across the board
[1:57:26.960 --> 1:57:28.960]  that all ties back together here
[1:57:28.960 --> 1:57:30.960]  we're going to come back and cover it
[1:57:30.960 --> 1:57:32.960]  I didn't plug any of this hour
[1:57:32.960 --> 1:57:34.960]  and we're again barely in the black right now
[1:57:34.960 --> 1:57:36.960]  we continue down this road another few months
[1:57:36.960 --> 1:57:38.960]  we'll be back in the red, so please go to
[1:57:38.960 --> 1:57:40.960]  great films, great books

[1:58:14.960 --> 1:58:16.960]  so please take action to declare independence
[1:58:16.960 --> 1:58:18.960]  from the new world order
[1:58:18.960 --> 1:58:20.960]  by keeping the tip of the spear on air
[1:58:20.960 --> 1:58:22.960]  and getting great products
[1:58:22.960 --> 1:58:24.960]  at infowarstore.com
[1:58:24.960 --> 1:58:26.960]  I want to thank you all
[1:58:26.960 --> 1:58:28.960]  this July 4th for your continued fight for America
[1:58:28.960 --> 1:58:30.960]  and I would encourage you to join the fight even harder now
[1:58:30.960 --> 1:58:32.960]  because we're so close to winning
[1:58:32.960 --> 1:58:34.960]  infowarstore.com
[1:58:34.960 --> 1:58:36.960]  and celebrate July 4th, 1776
[1:58:36.960 --> 1:58:38.960]  part 2
[1:58:38.960 --> 1:58:40.960]  against the new world order
[1:58:40.960 --> 1:58:42.960]  because the answer to 1984
[1:58:42.960 --> 1:58:44.960]  is
[1:58:44.960 --> 1:58:46.960]  1776
[1:58:46.960 --> 1:58:48.960]  let's go ahead
[1:58:48.960 --> 1:58:50.960]  and take another call
[1:58:50.960 --> 1:58:52.960]  let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee
[1:58:52.960 --> 1:58:53.960]  welcome
[1:58:53.960 --> 1:58:54.960]  hello Alex
[1:58:54.960 --> 1:58:55.960]  yes Malcolm
[1:58:55.960 --> 1:58:57.960]  alright I will make this quick and real short
[1:58:57.960 --> 1:58:59.960]  where the other patrons can get on the line
[1:58:59.960 --> 1:59:01.960]  Alex I have to promote one thing
[1:59:01.960 --> 1:59:03.960]  from one of your co-host Owen Schreuer
[1:59:03.960 --> 1:59:05.960]  SuperMailVialpility
[1:59:05.960 --> 1:59:06.960]  and Brainforce Plus
[1:59:06.960 --> 1:59:07.960]  mix those two together
[1:59:07.960 --> 1:59:09.960]  you're an unstoppable tank
[1:59:09.960 --> 1:59:11.960]  SuperMailVialpility really really works
[1:59:11.960 --> 1:59:13.960]  with herbs and natural compounds
[1:59:13.960 --> 1:59:15.960]  that have never been heated up
[1:59:15.960 --> 1:59:17.960]  and so it has a dramatic effect
[1:59:17.960 --> 1:59:19.960]  compared to powdered versions
[1:59:19.960 --> 1:59:21.960]  that also work quite well
[1:59:21.960 --> 1:59:22.960]  that just aren't as strong
[1:59:22.960 --> 1:59:24.960]  this is like a very fine wine
[1:59:24.960 --> 1:59:26.960]  in fact each batch is different
[1:59:26.960 --> 1:59:27.960]  sometimes it's super strong
[1:59:27.960 --> 1:59:28.960]  sometimes it's just okay
[1:59:28.960 --> 1:59:30.960]  people are like why are you selling something
[1:59:30.960 --> 1:59:32.960]  and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong
[1:59:32.960 --> 1:59:33.960]  that's just how it is
[1:59:33.960 --> 1:59:34.960]  it's how it works
[1:59:34.960 --> 1:59:36.960]  so it's always good
[1:59:36.960 --> 1:59:38.960]  it's just sometimes it's like super strong
[1:59:38.960 --> 1:59:40.960]  but yeah if you want the Rolls Royce
[1:59:40.960 --> 1:59:42.960]  then this is it
