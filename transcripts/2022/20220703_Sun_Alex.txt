[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]  [Music]
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000]  It's Sunday, July 3rd.
[00:00:12.832 --> 00:00:15.253]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:15.273 --> 00:00:17.973]  I'm extremely honored and blessed to be here with you.
[00:00:17.993 --> 00:00:23.955]  We're very thankful you care to spend time with us in the battle for a human future against the new world order.
[00:00:25.895 --> 00:00:29.958]   An anti-human, synthetic, System is being set up.
[00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:36.660]  And I've said this a thousand times, and I'm sure if I'm able to stay on air the next few years, I'll say it a thousand times more.
[00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:42.083]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[00:00:43.220 --> 00:01:00.268]  The globalists fight around the clock to surveil and censor and attack our speech because everything they're doing is dystopia by design and no one in their right mind would go along with it and accept it if they weren't bullied and gaslit into submission.
[00:01:01.368 --> 00:01:02.589]  The situation was hopeless.
[00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:06.808]  Their propaganda would not be necessary.
[00:01:06.808 --> 00:01:17.048]   Again, if it was helpless, they would not need to be trying to censor and bombard us continually.
[00:01:17.245 --> 00:01:24.652]  We can, we must, and we will prevail against this evil.
[00:01:25.893 --> 00:01:43.874]   July 4th is approaching, our nation's birthday, and our nation's far from perfect, but it's been very special because it enshrined The idea of God-given rights and the individual has the power to lead their own life as long as they don't hurt other individuals.
[00:01:45.535 --> 00:01:53.858]  And it's that idea that is in direct countervailance to the corporate, authoritarian, transhumanist world government.
[00:01:55.138 --> 00:02:01.920]  And that's why this nation and its ideas, though never fully realized, are under attack.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.481]  That's why people from around the world wanted to come here.
[00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.701]  Wanted to be part of America.
[00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:11.566]  Because compared to where they came from, this place was the promised land.
[00:02:13.208 --> 00:02:14.829]  And you can't have a worldwide tyranny.
[00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:27.843]  You can't have total darkness and absolute control and the authoritarianism of the transhumanist system if there's greener pastures somewhere else.
[00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:36.391]  You just can't get away with your post-human New World Order if the people have any options.
[00:02:37.851 --> 00:02:39.012]  And that's the simple fact.
[00:02:40.612 --> 00:02:49.555]  And everything you see is a war against independence, a war against the individual, a war against upward mobility, a war against freedom.
[00:02:51.353 --> 00:02:56.873]   an economic and religious and cultural choice, even over your own body,
[00:02:56.873 --> 00:03:00.951]  with their poison injections masquerading as vaccines.
[00:03:00.951 --> 00:03:12.953]   So today, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to be laying out some of the current big developments
[00:03:12.953 --> 00:03:22.072]   that are massive, that are unspeakably "
[00:03:17.935 --> 00:03:26.439]  Wicked will also be looking at some of the positive things that are happening as the global awakening and the counter to this tyranny accelerates.
[00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.380]  They're preparing new lockdowns, preparing new viral scares.
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.240]  We told you that was coming.
[00:03:30.941 --> 00:03:36.023]  Six, seven months ago, we told you it would be monkeypox because we see them pre-programming and preparing it.
[00:03:36.543 --> 00:03:38.944]  The truth is, when you're awake, you're awake and you see it all.
[00:03:39.704 --> 00:03:42.486]  And those of us that are awake say, why can't the public figure this out?
[00:03:43.288 --> 00:03:44.550]  And it's because they are asleep.
[00:03:45.271 --> 00:03:55.609]  So it's our jobs to wake people up however we can so they will not fall prey to this high-tech tyranny that we are all facing here in the year 2022.
[00:03:55.649 --> 00:04:05.374]   But I have to tell you, The mere fact that we're still on air, the mere fact that we are here reaching millions of people thanks to your support and your word of mouth and your prayer is incredible.
[00:04:05.534 --> 00:04:15.798]  And it enrages the authoritarians and their minions that have signed on to this evil because they know in the end they are destined to lose.
[00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:17.979]  That's why they wage war against common sense.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.580]  That's why they wage war against God's order.
[00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:23.762]  That's why they wage war against everything it is to be human.
[00:04:24.602 --> 00:04:27.143]  Because what we have is good, and what we have is strong.
[00:04:27.683 --> 00:04:28.703]  What we have is beautiful.
[00:04:29.204 --> 00:04:39.967]  And they can't contend with that, so that's why they sell poverty and ugliness and strife and conflict and division in the name of their great New World Order unity.
[00:04:41.283 --> 00:04:44.425]  All right, big Sunday broadcast lined up for you today.

[00:04:53.952 --> 00:04:56.354]  And I know you're doing a great job, and that's why the globalists are so pissed.
[00:04:56.794 --> 00:04:57.815]  I salute you all for your efforts.
[00:04:57.835 --> 00:04:58.376]  We'll be right back.

[00:05:55.604 --> 00:05:59.724]  because the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:05:59.724 --> 00:06:15.805]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:06:16.275 --> 00:06:17.836]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:19.557 --> 00:06:21.518]  And it's Sunday, July 3rd, 2022.
[00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:23.540]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.301]  I'm just gonna tell it like it is.
[00:06:27.582 --> 00:06:51.987]   I declare This July 4th, 2022, there'll be a Declaration of Independence against the alien force on this planet today, waging war against humans and our biology and our very future that is attempting to exterminate the majority of us and force the minority that's left to merge with AI computers and become cyborg slaves of Satan.
[00:06:54.244 --> 00:07:00.006]  Now you've heard Elon Musk last year say, beware billionaires that worship AI gods.
[00:07:00.946 --> 00:07:12.751]  And he tells you the global elite believe they're going to transcend humans and are going to create alien life forms, new life forms, the merger of humans and machines here on Earth, and human-animal hybrids merging with machines.
[00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:13.771]  That is alien.
[00:07:15.531 --> 00:07:25.596]   We received a DNA gene sequence in a radio transmission from deep space, hypothetically, And with now CRISPR gene editing systems,
[00:07:25.596 --> 00:07:33.817]   if scientists put together that new creature and then planted the embryo inside,
[00:07:33.817 --> 00:07:39.216]   say, a cow's uterus to grow it, as they do humanoids now, that's already going on for decades,
[00:07:39.216 --> 00:07:42.716]  that would be an alien on this planet.
[00:07:42.716 --> 00:07:46.016]  So if it's aliens running this, I don't know.
[00:07:46.016 --> 00:07:51.257]   But the globalists setting this plan up are anti-human and say humans are obsolete,
[00:07:51.257 --> 00:07:53.956]  whether it's Harari or Klaus Schwab or Bill Gates.
[00:07:53.956 --> 00:08:00.016]   And they're involved in a revolution or an update where you don't just get rid of your last phone
[00:08:00.016 --> 00:08:04.617]   or your last computer or your last garage door opener, you get rid of humans themselves.
[00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:08.001]  And that's the anti-human revolution that's happening.
[00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:19.883]  With their carbon taxes, with their global surveillance, with their quote, great reset to build back better, there'll be no humans as we have known ourselves at the end of this revolution.
[00:08:19.903 --> 00:08:20.923]  And that's all been announced.
[00:08:21.383 --> 00:08:24.584]  And the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times looking forward to the end of humanity.
[00:08:28.024 --> 00:08:40.754]  The Bible tells us it's a fallen entity manipulating us here on this planet to set up a world government, make us have a digital mark of the beast to buy and sell, and that we'll have to give up our humanity in the process and give up our free will and our soul.
[00:08:41.115 --> 00:08:44.458]  That was said 2,000 years ago by John the Revelator on the Isle of Patmos.
[00:08:45.578 --> 00:08:48.521]  And it was also stated in Ezekiel in the Old Testament and Daniel.
[00:08:49.922 --> 00:09:18.860]   And so you can look at it any way you want, but the global social engineers, futurists, Are following Revelation to a T. Absolutely following it to a T. And so whether it's saying a man can have a baby, or two women can have a baby when it's a man and a woman in a prison, or the left saying, hey, love is love, let three-year-olds date 20-year-olds.
[00:09:20.461 --> 00:09:27.942]  All of this is about getting you to go against your own common sense and the programming God gave you and follow destructive practices known as sin.
[00:09:30.305 --> 00:09:36.688]  And you think of sin as cheating on your wife or drinking too much alcohol or cheating on your taxes, but that's low-level stuff.
[00:09:37.068 --> 00:09:41.270]  Real sin is going against your human code that God gave you.
[00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:42.990]  And that's where we are.
[00:09:44.091 --> 00:09:49.333]  More than 20 states have passed laws to use dead bodies for fuel and dead bodies for fertilizer.
[00:09:49.713 --> 00:09:51.374]  All sponsored by the UN and Bill Gates.
[00:09:53.675 --> 00:09:55.296]  They're coming out with these gene therapies.
[00:09:55.316 --> 00:09:56.076]  They're forcing on us.
[00:09:56.116 --> 00:10:03.209]   Now the FDA says, We're just gonna go ahead and authorize all these new shots with no trials.
[00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.812]  That's a revolution against you.
[00:10:05.832 --> 00:10:10.278]  Because they're not just offering unproven dangerous things, they're saying you gotta take it!
[00:10:13.649 --> 00:10:19.436]  So that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen, and the list of tyrannies and attacks on humanity goes on and on.
[00:10:19.456 --> 00:10:20.838]  I'm going to talk about it more in the next segment.
[00:10:21.238 --> 00:10:23.741]  But first, I want to air a new report that just came out on Saturday.
[00:10:23.761 --> 00:10:26.044]  The report's live at Band.Video.
[00:10:26.064 --> 00:10:28.227]  We'll post it today on the live show feed.
[00:10:29.148 --> 00:10:37.839]   And that's Greg Reese's Latest report, AI factory to process 5,000 tons of meat per day delivered via trains.
[00:10:38.559 --> 00:10:40.462]  There's something a lot bigger than this.
[00:10:41.263 --> 00:10:43.946]  And Gregory's foreshadows that and hints at it.
[00:10:44.066 --> 00:10:45.088]  Very important report.
[00:10:45.568 --> 00:10:46.629]  It's at man.video.
[00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:48.990]  Here is that report.
[00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:55.990]  [Music]
[00:10:55.990 --> 00:11:00.990]   While 80% of the world's population continues on with oil and gas,
[00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:06.990]   the United States and a small handful of Western nations have decided to go green,
[00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:08.990]  even if it kills everyone.
[00:11:09.713 --> 00:11:21.540]  They have already admitted that the disruptive economic burden this will cause is exactly the sort of pressure required to inspire the innovation needed to make it all work someday.
[00:11:22.321 --> 00:11:23.462]  Because that's the plan.
[00:11:23.762 --> 00:11:27.064]  There are no viable solutions to replace oil and gas.
[00:11:27.484 --> 00:11:38.211]  So the sooner we can figure it out, the sooner we can stop the endless rise of inflation, starvation, and death that will obviously result from shutting off our energy taps.
[00:11:39.171 --> 00:11:45.174]  And a new company has already appeared, albeit with a bizarre solution to our problems.
[00:11:46.054 --> 00:11:54.759]  A massive meat rendering facility is set to break ground next year in Rapid City, South Dakota, and be completed by 2026.
[00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:05.384]  With the ordinary name, the Western Legacy Development Corporation, one might never guess how innovative this company actually is.
[00:12:06.678 --> 00:12:21.666]  The Western Legacy Development Corporation will process cattle and bison completely with robotics and artificial intelligence, including new laser technology air knives that use a high-velocity airstream to de-hide the animals.
[00:12:22.647 --> 00:12:32.312]  The Western Legacy Development Corporation is building a massive one-million-square-foot meat factory that will be operating at levels as high as 8,000 cattle per day.
[00:12:34.355 --> 00:12:43.541]  Now, one might ask, what about all this social engineering to stop eating real beef and get used to eating lab-grown meat and bugs?
[00:12:44.041 --> 00:12:47.363]  Aren't we being told that cow farts are bad for the environment?
[00:12:47.963 --> 00:12:57.009]  Well, as it turns out, the Western Legacy Development Corporation isn't necessarily going to be processing 3 million cattle per year for food.
[00:12:57.689 --> 00:13:10.272]  The Western Legacy Development Corporation will be collecting animal fat to be used as feed and fuel, a biofuel that they will use to power their very own one million square foot facility.
[00:13:11.072 --> 00:13:12.372]  Now, how green is that?
[00:13:13.393 --> 00:13:19.194]  Well, maybe not small farm, grass-fed level green, but still, it's pretty green.
[00:13:20.234 --> 00:13:26.178]  Rapid City is a small town, and many residents are asking, where will they get 8,000 cattle a day?
[00:13:26.759 --> 00:13:27.739]  And where will they keep them?
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:33.644]  And where will they get 2,500 employees, which is 3% of their population?
[00:13:34.064 --> 00:13:35.125]  And where will they house them?
[00:13:35.945 --> 00:13:50.395]  These questions weren't really answered, but we do know that they plan to have a thriving rail system that will be offloading thousands of cattle each and every day directly into the AI robot laser slaughterhouse for immediate processing.
[00:13:51.295 --> 00:13:53.437]  So they won't need to store the cattle anywhere.
[00:13:54.037 --> 00:14:06.805]  Now, while this may sound like some sort of crazy economist's solution to cleaning up a mass murder, or even some kind of Soylent Green scenario where the government is chopping up people in a factory for food.
[00:14:07.426 --> 00:14:09.187]  And in this case, energy.
[00:14:09.427 --> 00:14:11.288]  Soylent Green is people!
[00:14:12.995 --> 00:14:17.719]  We are told that it's all for the environment, so I'm sure it's all good.
[00:14:18.319 --> 00:14:22.622]  And hey, at least we won't be burning any more oil, like the rest of the world.
[00:14:23.203 --> 00:14:25.604]  And don't worry, trust the science.
[00:14:25.685 --> 00:14:25.985]  Russia.
[00:14:27.153 --> 00:14:28.494]  Russia, Russia, Russia.
[00:14:28.614 --> 00:14:29.714]  And remember the plan.
[00:14:30.294 --> 00:14:34.596]  Once we really start suffering, someone will eventually think of a solution.
[00:14:35.217 --> 00:14:40.479]  And if not, at least we were willing to die for a criminal government run by pedophiles.
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.621]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:14:45.601 --> 00:14:51.324]  So you see, it's very, very, very, very simple.
[00:14:53.035 --> 00:14:59.400]  They turn off society, they turn off the gas, the fuel, they declare there's gonna be no more beef, no more eating meat, you're gonna eat bugs.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.603]  And as things collapse, they say, oh, do what we say, it'll get better.
[00:15:04.103 --> 00:15:08.046]  But really, it's a collapsed economy designed to feed all of us into it.
[00:15:08.626 --> 00:15:10.228]  And obviously, you can put two and two together.
[00:15:10.528 --> 00:15:13.550]  That facility is not for cows, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:14.371 --> 00:15:18.133]  All their actuaries, all their numbers talk about fueling the new economy on dead humans.
[00:15:18.914 --> 00:15:20.255]  Why are they gonna have so many dead humans?
[00:15:22.398 --> 00:15:25.159]  Because they're going to release even more deadly bioweapons in the very near future.
[00:15:25.779 --> 00:15:28.099]  Now, if I told you that ten years ago, and I did, you'd roll your eyes.
[00:15:28.139 --> 00:15:29.520]  Today, you don't roll your eyes, because you know.
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.441]  These are psychotic predators who are making their move on all of us.
[00:15:35.361 --> 00:15:38.081]  Remy Ling, more information out on this front.
[00:15:39.742 --> 00:15:49.044]  The design, control, collapse of the economy and how to stop it, straight ahead on this special Sunday, July 4th eve, worldwide emergency broadcast.
[00:15:50.117 --> 00:15:53.839]  I hope you share that video by Gregg Reese from Band.Video.
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.441]  Or you can just submit and roll over and die.
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.640]  I know you want to fight back like I do.
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:11.640]  They don't want this brain trust, this spirit trust on air.
[00:16:12.025 --> 00:16:14.887]  They want to get to you, and they got to get through us to get to you.
[00:16:15.228 --> 00:16:17.509]  They want to get to my children, they got to get through me first.
[00:16:17.889 --> 00:16:20.231]  They want to get to your family, they got to get through you first.
[00:16:20.491 --> 00:16:25.775]  And I'm telling you, I'm on record, the one thing I want to do is beat these Satanists, and I don't back off 1%.
[00:16:26.515 --> 00:16:28.937]  I am full-on war with these people.
[00:16:29.177 --> 00:16:32.880]  But I need your backing if you want me to go in there and stomp the living hell out of these people.
[00:16:33.584 --> 00:16:43.068]  So I want you to go now to infowarrestore.com, as you've done before, and gotten great products that enrich you, that enrich us, that we 360 win together, and build our community of victory now!
[00:16:44.488 --> 00:16:49.290]  We have the July 4th Super Sale that starts today and will run through next Wednesday, and I gotta tell you the good news.
[00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:50.850]  This is the best prices ever.
[00:16:51.311 --> 00:16:53.671]  The bad news is a bunch of this stuff is sold out.
[00:16:53.952 --> 00:16:57.313]  We're not even sure we're gonna get it again, but we gotta have the money now.
[00:16:58.993 --> 00:17:06.839]  So we have Super Female Vitality Cold Press Compounded Herbs that are known to supercharge vitality in women, including libido.
[00:17:07.179 --> 00:17:08.940]  It's an incredible product.
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:13.863]  That and the super powerful Ionine Surface Spray, the strongest thing out there known.
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.343]  Knocks out anything in seconds on services.
[00:17:17.823 --> 00:17:23.690]  Both of those, ladies and gentlemen, are 60% off of double Patriot points.
[00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:28.355]  And then hair and beard formula, which I'll just be honest, has been a terrible seller.
[00:17:28.395 --> 00:17:30.718]  We got 20,000 bottles of it and nobody wants to buy it.
[00:17:30.778 --> 00:17:31.538]  Nobody likes it.
[00:17:31.599 --> 00:17:34.802]  And guys that have beards think they don't need that kind of crap with our audience.
[00:17:35.863 --> 00:17:43.092]  It's a super vitamin mineral, high-end multivitamin mineral that kids could take, old people, young people, you name it.
[00:17:43.132 --> 00:17:45.695]  I'm tempted to pull the labels off of it and just say multivitamin on it.
[00:17:46.095 --> 00:17:49.740]  We can't keep the multivitamin stock, and quite frankly, that's what I said when we got this in.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.783]  I said, this is a better formula than our multivitamin, which is incredible!
[00:17:53.064 --> 00:17:54.545]  This one's a little bit better.
[00:17:55.396 --> 00:18:01.540]  So, the Heron Beer Formula is an amazing multivitamin mineral for your immune system, your body, and we can't sell the damn thing.
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.802]  It costs us more per bottle.
[00:18:03.822 --> 00:18:05.563]  It's high-end, but we're selling it for.
[00:18:05.783 --> 00:18:07.464]  We're clearing that sucker out right now.
[00:18:07.484 --> 00:18:09.806]  75% off with double-paid three points.

[00:18:35.906 --> 00:18:37.167]  I've got like a thousand left.
[00:18:37.487 --> 00:18:38.087]  Prostagard.
[00:18:38.107 --> 00:18:38.848]  Open Fish Oil.
[00:18:38.888 --> 00:18:39.448]  Vazobeat.
[00:18:39.688 --> 00:18:41.609]  We're blowing everything out right now.
[00:18:41.629 --> 00:18:47.673]  It's more like a locomotive firing up that engine to go full power and I don't care what happens is up to God now.
[00:18:47.732 --> 00:18:53.173]   I'm throwing it all in against them and going head to head with these people and you're backing me and I love you.
[00:18:53.173 --> 00:19:01.052]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:19:01.052 --> 00:19:07.611]   At this point, best case scenario is a few years of hard times for us all.
[00:19:07.738 --> 00:19:11.099]  And if we don't turn it around soon, then it will only get worse.
[00:19:11.979 --> 00:19:15.700]  But as bad as things are, we still have time to prepare.
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.681]  And that alone is something to be grateful for.
[00:19:19.381 --> 00:19:26.548]  A gravity water filter will provide you with clean, healthy water, even in the event of your taps getting shut off.
[00:19:27.249 --> 00:19:31.973]  And having your own food will save you from getting ensnared in government FEMA camps.
[00:19:32.734 --> 00:19:38.860]  And if you've already stocked up enough for your own family, you might want to consider stocking up for your neighbors.
[00:19:39.921 --> 00:19:49.627]  Some of your neighbors might not be prepared for what's coming, but you can help them by having an abundance of storable foods and water filtration.
[00:19:50.208 --> 00:19:53.890]  Whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.
[00:19:55.091 --> 00:19:58.693]  Stock up now at preparetoday.com.
[00:20:02.336 --> 00:20:06.895]   leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:20:06.895 --> 00:20:08.895]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:08.895 --> 00:20:23.296]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:20:23.296 --> 00:20:24.816]  (upbeat music)
[00:20:24.744 --> 00:20:28.103]  crashing the lies and disinformation.
[00:20:28.103 --> 00:20:33.384]  [MUSIC]
[00:20:33.384 --> 00:20:38.423]   The New World Order's mission going up against God and humanity is the impossible mission.
[00:20:38.563 --> 00:20:49.210]  They may have stolen control of the banks and the currency, they may have put trillions in fake money to try to destroy the economy and transfer us over to the transhumanist agenda, but they will fail in the end.
[00:20:50.511 --> 00:21:00.898]  Because we have been given divine providence, divine discernment, and a divine mission.
[00:21:02.077 --> 00:21:03.497]  Our mission is guaranteed.
[00:21:03.517 --> 00:21:07.559]  The only question is who will join the mission and come in for the big win.
[00:21:07.579 --> 00:21:19.242]  All right, let's go over this stack that just ties into the last horrific report about a facility to cut up mammals that turned them into biofuel.
[00:21:22.423 --> 00:21:28.831]   Now, what fuel cost, you will never be able in the actuary to actually Fund a facility like that.
[00:21:29.652 --> 00:21:33.472]  So it's only done when you've cut off all the other energy, and that's the only energy you're allowing.
[00:21:34.072 --> 00:21:37.693]  And all the laws are being passed for it to be humans in that facility.
[00:21:39.354 --> 00:21:40.134]  There's Salon.
[00:21:40.194 --> 00:21:42.694]  Will the power plants of the future burn dead bodies?
[00:21:43.094 --> 00:21:50.136]  See, when I tell you I see something, I know what's going to happen with it, it's because I've got thousands of data points and decades of research behind it.
[00:21:51.776 --> 00:21:52.996]  But you don't need me to tell you.
[00:21:54.437 --> 00:21:56.137]  You see right there what that is, don't you?
[00:21:57.554 --> 00:21:59.795]  It's not going to be cows, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:00.856 --> 00:22:02.297]  It's going to be dead people.
[00:22:04.538 --> 00:22:05.999]  And I'm sure some will arrive alive.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:12.903]  Vegan mother convicted after 18-month-old son died from a zero-meat diet.
[00:22:14.364 --> 00:22:16.205]  Yeah, folks, we're supposed to eat meat.
[00:22:18.106 --> 00:22:18.826]  We're omnivores.
[00:22:21.248 --> 00:22:25.110]  AI-run factory to process 5,000 tons of meat per day.
[00:22:26.667 --> 00:22:27.587]  Delivered via trains.
[00:22:30.128 --> 00:22:36.369]  Biden blocks offshore drilling, limiting oil production after begging oil companies to produce more and attacking gas stations.
[00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:44.351]  And Biden, in the clip we played last segment, copied Trump, but Trump said as a joke, Russia, Russia, Russia.
[00:22:44.411 --> 00:22:46.532]  That's why they cut off the pipelines.
[00:22:46.612 --> 00:22:47.272]  Putin did that.
[00:22:47.712 --> 00:22:49.273]  That's who cut off the drilling permits.
[00:22:49.373 --> 00:22:50.073]  Putin did that.
[00:22:50.433 --> 00:22:53.694]  That's who shut down drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and Anwar, Alaska.
[00:22:53.994 --> 00:22:54.714]  Putin did that.
[00:22:56.089 --> 00:22:56.489]  Of course.
[00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:01.131]  30 seconds of research will show you that's a complete fraud.
[00:23:04.432 --> 00:23:16.676]  But he says it's all Putin, and he said, while we're busy on this transition to green energy, so he tells you we're doing this to you for green energy, really for power and control, but it's also Putin's fault.
[00:23:16.696 --> 00:23:22.158]  Oxymoronic lies, gaslighting, never-before-seen levels.
[00:23:23.373 --> 00:23:42.886]  But the good news is the Supreme Court cut back the deep state bureaucracy at the EPA with a ruling on Thursday saying you just can't make your own laws and shut off all our coal power plants and bankrupt the nation, especially when India and China and Mexico and 160 other countries plus are making zero cuts in their emissions.
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.121]  Carbon's good in our atmosphere.
[00:23:46.521 --> 00:23:48.442]  It's a trace gas, carbon dioxide.
[00:23:48.702 --> 00:23:49.923]  It's what the planet lives off of.
[00:23:50.303 --> 00:23:56.386]  You can give plants three, four times the carbon dioxide, and they grow three, four times faster and more healthy, and put out more oxygen.
[00:23:57.086 --> 00:23:58.767]  Why are they attacking the atmosphere?
[00:23:59.147 --> 00:24:01.708]  Cows' methane is part of the atmosphere.
[00:24:02.529 --> 00:24:03.950]  Our methane is part of the atmosphere.
[00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:09.052]  If you can tax a cow or ban a cow because it farts, what is it saying about a human?
[00:24:09.432 --> 00:24:12.834]  This is an attack on life and the life system on this planet.
[00:24:14.827 --> 00:24:17.388]  It's like the joke at space balls where they have attacks on air.
[00:24:21.009 --> 00:24:25.031]  The worst stock market sell-off is half a century might not be done yet.
[00:24:25.051 --> 00:24:26.151]  Yahoo Finance.
[00:24:26.751 --> 00:24:30.913]  China on track for contagious crash within weeks.
[00:24:30.933 --> 00:24:32.453]  Threat of deflation for whole world.
[00:24:34.374 --> 00:24:36.955]  Texas power used to break records next week during heat wave.
[00:24:37.195 --> 00:24:39.556]  They say there may be power outages because they can't use coal.
[00:24:40.556 --> 00:24:42.717]  And it goes on and on and on.
[00:24:44.025 --> 00:24:50.288]  Nearly 8,000 flights delayed on Friday as July 4th weekend.
[00:24:52.569 --> 00:24:53.069]  To be hell.
[00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:59.332]  The collapse of civilization by design.
[00:24:59.672 --> 00:25:03.672]  That is what we are witnessing in real time.
[00:25:03.672 --> 00:25:09.672]  And then I've got all this news.
[00:25:09.672 --> 00:25:19.672]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:25:11.001 --> 00:25:14.044]  You know, we have an archivist, and there's no use tooting our horn.
[00:25:14.064 --> 00:25:15.625]  Everybody knows we covered this at nauseam.
[00:25:16.426 --> 00:25:29.157]  I said last year and early this year, the pre-programming I saw in the media, the truck that overturned in Pennsylvania with the monkeypox and the smallpox found in the Merck lab and all the pre-programming.
[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:41.870]  I said, the next thing they're going to launch is monkeypox, because I saw that Bill Gates is profiting from it and had hundreds of millions of smallpox monkeypox vaccines being made two years ago.
[00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:45.533]  I mean, it's not hard to go, well, he's the guy that ran all this stuff before.
[00:25:45.933 --> 00:25:46.694]  He's about to do it.
[00:25:47.355 --> 00:25:49.056]  And I didn't just say it once it happened.
[00:25:49.096 --> 00:25:50.457]  I called it before it happened.
[00:25:51.278 --> 00:25:54.351]   And just like Lockhart, It happened.
[00:25:55.152 --> 00:25:56.894]  And now, all over the U.S.
[00:25:56.954 --> 00:26:01.398]  and New York and California and everywhere, they're saying we need new lockdowns.
[00:26:02.479 --> 00:26:07.584]  Because... Monkeypox hasn't killed anybody.
[00:26:07.604 --> 00:26:09.526]  A few thousand cases worldwide.
[00:26:10.066 --> 00:26:14.430]  Vaccine injury in the studies is exactly like from this COVID shot.
[00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:15.291]  It's not even a vaccine.
[00:26:15.331 --> 00:26:16.572]  It's exactly like monkeypox.
[00:26:16.973 --> 00:26:17.754]  But never mind that.
[00:26:18.715 --> 00:26:20.936]  We got 500-something cases worldwide.
[00:26:21.016 --> 00:26:25.598]  We've got to start locking down again and teaching you to live under martial law.
[00:26:27.199 --> 00:26:30.501]  World Health Organization issues fresh warning over monkeypox.
[00:26:31.581 --> 00:26:34.103]  That's a story on Infowars.com by RT.
[00:26:35.203 --> 00:26:35.843]  That's right.
[00:26:37.124 --> 00:26:41.646]  And you've got this TapoSanDiego tweet.
[00:26:41.966 --> 00:26:44.908]  I have lived to see man-made horrors beyond my imagination.
[00:26:45.408 --> 00:26:47.229]  A baby, if you're a radio listener, and I'll describe it.
[00:26:49.076 --> 00:26:55.617]  With a blue surgical mask over its face and eyes with two holes cut out so they can see.
[00:26:55.958 --> 00:26:59.038]  Hey, why not just put a pillow over your baby's face?
[00:27:00.238 --> 00:27:01.759]  But that's the cult of these idiots.
[00:27:02.659 --> 00:27:08.360]  The Fauci-funded Peter Daszak is now working with Kremlin-backed researchers isolating new coronavirus strains.
[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:10.121]  Yeah, they're all just mercenaries.
[00:27:10.161 --> 00:27:11.101]  Now he's working with the Russians.
[00:27:13.598 --> 00:27:15.359]  And Biden says there's going to be another pandemic.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.741]  Boy, wasn't Dr. Vladimir Zelenko right?
[00:27:18.761 --> 00:27:20.262]  He passed away on Thursday.
[00:27:20.302 --> 00:27:22.163]  We love you, Dr. Zelenko.
[00:27:22.664 --> 00:27:26.526]  Who says, that's the UN, monkeypox cases triple in Europe in two weeks.
[00:27:26.666 --> 00:27:28.628]  Urgent action needed to contain the spread.
[00:27:28.648 --> 00:27:34.551]  A warning to anyone attending mass gatherings over the weekend.
[00:27:34.611 --> 00:27:35.732]  Monkeypox threat in the UK.
[00:27:35.992 --> 00:27:36.472]  Don't do it.
[00:27:36.873 --> 00:27:37.513]  Oh, don't go out.
[00:27:37.773 --> 00:27:41.716]  They're getting you ready just like in 2020 for the next lockdown.
[00:27:42.722 --> 00:27:43.902]  For now, weary U.S.
[00:27:44.463 --> 00:27:46.503]  treads water with transformed COVID-19.
[00:27:46.864 --> 00:27:48.244]  New strains, AP reports.

[00:27:50.165 --> 00:27:55.987]  The ultra-contagious Omicron variants, BA4, BA5, fueling California coronavirus wave.
[00:27:56.227 --> 00:27:59.869]  And they need new lockdowns, says Governor Newsom, right on time.
[00:28:01.809 --> 00:28:03.230]  Unbelievable.
[00:28:06.038 --> 00:28:07.339]  And they're talking about civil war.
[00:28:07.359 --> 00:28:08.640]  They're talking about dictatorship.
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:09.640]  Biden's saving us.

[00:28:14.603 --> 00:28:15.344]  Be a dictator!
[00:28:15.704 --> 00:28:16.564]  Well, he's already a dictator.
[00:28:16.604 --> 00:28:17.285]  He stole the election.
[00:28:18.902 --> 00:28:21.443]  But if I was you, I'd spread the word about the broadcast more than ever.

[00:29:46.526 --> 00:29:54.285]   info war store.com and celebrate July 4th, 1776 part two against the new world order
[00:29:54.285 --> 00:30:03.404]   because the answer to 1984 is 1776. When the president got in the beast, he was under the
[00:30:03.404 --> 00:30:09.245]   impression from Mr. Meadows that the off the record movement to the Capitol was still possible
[00:30:09.245 --> 00:30:11.884]  and likely to happen, but that Bobby had more information.
[00:30:12.029 --> 00:30:26.860]  So once the President had gotten into the vehicle with Bobby, he thought that they were going up to the Capitol, and when Bobby had relayed to him, we're not, you don't have the assets to do it, it's not secure, we're going back to the West Wing.
[00:30:28.428 --> 00:30:34.729]  The President had a very strong, very angry response to that.
[00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:37.690]  Tony described him as being irate.
[00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.751]  Gotcha.
[00:30:41.251 --> 00:30:41.691]  Good news.
[00:30:41.771 --> 00:30:43.591]  We're not going to go to the Capitol.
[00:30:43.611 --> 00:30:44.671]  We're going back to the White House.
[00:30:47.092 --> 00:30:50.933]  The President said something to the effect of, I'm fucking President.
[00:30:51.253 --> 00:30:52.493]  Take me up to the Capitol now.
[00:30:54.042 --> 00:30:58.523]  To which Bobby responded, Sir, we have to go back to the West Wing.
[00:30:59.823 --> 00:31:04.624]  The President reached up towards the front of the vehicle to grab at the steering wheel.
[00:31:05.244 --> 00:31:08.505]  Oh my God!
[00:31:08.685 --> 00:31:11.006]  Oh my dear Jesus Christ!
[00:31:12.386 --> 00:31:13.866]  Turn off the lights!
[00:31:14.527 --> 00:31:15.907]  Turn off the lights!
[00:31:16.007 --> 00:31:16.547]  Turn them off!
[00:31:19.912 --> 00:31:25.137]  Mr. Engle grabbed his arm, said, sir, you need to take your hand off the steering wheel.
[00:31:26.138 --> 00:31:28.020]  We're going back to the West Wing.
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:29.702]  We're not going to the Capitol.
[00:31:31.624 --> 00:31:35.167]  Mr. Trump then used his free hand to lunge towards Bobby Engle.
[00:31:35.367 --> 00:31:40.567]   And when Mr. Ornato had recounted this story to me, he had motioned towards his clavicles.
[00:31:40.567 --> 00:31:55.047]   And was Mr. Engel in the room as Mr. Ornato told you this story?
[00:31:55.249 --> 00:31:55.630]  He was.
[00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:03.172]  Did Mr. Engle correct or disagree with any part of the story from Mr. Ornato?
[00:32:03.732 --> 00:32:07.393]  Mr. Engle did not correct or disagree with any part of the story.
[00:32:08.353 --> 00:32:14.575]  Did Mr. Engle or Mr. Ornato ever after that tell you that what Mr. Ornato had just said was untrue?
[00:32:16.088 --> 00:32:19.871]  Neither Mr. Renato nor Mr. Engle told me ever that it was untrue.
[00:32:19.891 --> 00:32:36.504]  Oh, no, no, I don't even know what this is!
[00:32:36.524 --> 00:32:37.865]  How'd you get here?
[00:32:39.304 --> 00:32:41.385]  I just caught you, American!
[00:32:41.705 --> 00:32:43.805]  You visited Bandar Video!
[00:32:44.685 --> 00:32:48.046]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you!
[00:32:48.286 --> 00:32:55.286]   Do what CNN says and do not visit MandarVideo or I have to hurt you.
[00:32:55.286 --> 00:33:02.286]  [Music]
[00:33:02.286 --> 00:33:09.286]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:09.286 --> 00:33:14.286]  [Music]
[00:33:14.938 --> 00:33:22.746]  It's Sunday, July 3rd, and we are broadcasting worldwide.
[00:33:23.327 --> 00:33:28.432]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:30.436 --> 00:33:36.962]  Remember, powerful forces of evil are working around the clock to ensure this broadcast is not heard.
[00:33:37.122 --> 00:33:40.445]  But we, the people, are rising.
[00:33:40.905 --> 00:33:47.751]  And the power of you, the activist audience, is unstoppable with God's aid when you decide to take action.
[00:33:48.792 --> 00:33:57.379]  So pray for God to lead God and direct you, and to give you the foresight and the discernment to take this information to the four corners of the earth.
[00:34:00.163 --> 00:34:01.144]  All right, here it is.
[00:34:01.364 --> 00:34:10.170]  So, we have national polls put out by mainline pollsters that always oversample at least 15% more Democrat because they claim the country's Democratic.
[00:34:11.571 --> 00:34:12.972]  Democratic Party, crime syndicate.
[00:34:13.553 --> 00:34:21.739]  And in the national polls, depending on the poll, between 70 and 80% of people don't want Biden to run again and don't like Biden.
[00:34:23.117 --> 00:34:24.939]  Here's another one out of the hill.
[00:34:24.959 --> 00:34:28.121]  71% don't want Biden to run for re-election.
[00:34:28.181 --> 00:34:32.645]  I thought he just won with even 9 million more votes than Obama.
[00:34:32.725 --> 00:34:35.228]  I mean, I never said Obama stole the elections.
[00:34:35.288 --> 00:34:36.389]  Obama won those elections.
[00:34:37.149 --> 00:34:41.914]  He ran against the ringers of John McCain and Mitt Romney and he was popular, at least the first time.
[00:34:42.154 --> 00:34:42.614]  He won.
[00:34:42.654 --> 00:34:43.275]  The evidence is there.
[00:34:44.858 --> 00:34:49.181]  But he's in his third administration now, fraudulently, through this puppet.
[00:34:49.241 --> 00:34:51.082]  This is the third Obama administration.
[00:34:51.382 --> 00:34:54.124]  I know you all know that, but we need to get that information out to everybody.
[00:34:55.785 --> 00:34:59.267]  And so I see articles in the Washington Post, Yahoo, New York Times, everywhere.
[00:34:59.847 --> 00:35:02.229]  Biden needs to act with executive power.
[00:35:02.249 --> 00:35:09.073]  Well, he's already doing it, shutting down the pipelines, and the oil drilling, and ordering the border wide open, and continuing the devaluation of the dollar.
[00:35:09.733 --> 00:35:11.114]  I mean, he's already doing that executively.
[00:35:12.094 --> 00:35:14.256]  And so they're saying, be dictatorial.
[00:35:15.527 --> 00:35:16.628]  Override the courts.
[00:35:16.888 --> 00:35:17.888]  Override the Congress.
[00:35:18.368 --> 00:35:19.369]  Override the governors.
[00:35:19.769 --> 00:35:20.289]  Do it all.
[00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:22.591]  Here's Yahoo News.
[00:35:23.231 --> 00:35:28.674]  Pressure builds on Biden to turn to executive action despite its limits and risk.
[00:35:29.334 --> 00:35:36.598]  The article goes on to say he's got inflation, he's got recession, domestic agenda, he's got abortion, he's gotta do it right now.
[00:35:37.798 --> 00:35:55.832]   Meanwhile, Biden administration signs five-year contract to house migrant children, many of them smuggled and kidnapped, At North Carolina school, 14,000 of them, that God knows what the global esteem state is going to be doing with all of those people.
[00:35:58.534 --> 00:36:04.877]  So that's where we are with them cutting off the infrastructure, them cutting our nation off.
[00:36:05.357 --> 00:36:09.700]  This is nothing less than economic war.
[00:36:11.445 --> 00:36:21.692]  Let me address this right now, because I don't like to get predictions wrong, and I rarely do get predictions wrong, but Alex Jones is not always right.
[00:36:22.172 --> 00:36:26.415]  Alex Jones was right, is a more accurate statement.
[00:36:28.016 --> 00:36:30.718]  Roger Stone is very close friends with Trump, that's not a secret.
[00:36:31.759 --> 00:36:43.275]   And on the show a few days ago, the weekday show, Roger said That he expects Trump to declare in July.
[00:36:44.957 --> 00:36:46.880]  Then I talked to Roger Offair, and I'll leave it at that.
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:47.981]  I made some other phone calls.
[00:36:48.662 --> 00:36:53.167]  And Trump, as of last week, was saying, I think I'll announce July 4th.
[00:36:53.207 --> 00:36:55.590]  Now, they call it tactical flexibility.
[00:36:56.071 --> 00:36:56.952]  Doesn't mean he will.
[00:36:58.609 --> 00:37:00.570]  But it's a political attack to shut him down.
[00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:04.812]  Once he declares, that'll make him harder with fake indictments and things of that nature.
[00:37:04.872 --> 00:37:14.576]  So it ended up being ABC News, NBC News, The London Guardian, I mean everywhere, Alex Jones says Trump will declare July 4th.
[00:37:14.716 --> 00:37:15.556]  I did not say that.
[00:37:16.717 --> 00:37:19.018]  But they'll say if he doesn't declare on Monday.
[00:37:19.378 --> 00:37:21.079]  Jones is wrong again!
[00:37:21.159 --> 00:37:22.980]  Jones said Trump would declare.
[00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:24.840]  But they won't show you a video.
[00:37:25.081 --> 00:37:27.902]  They'll show you some edited text.
[00:37:29.232 --> 00:37:29.793]  Of what I said.
[00:37:29.833 --> 00:37:30.954]  But everybody saw the show.
[00:37:32.655 --> 00:37:33.276]  Everybody heard it.
[00:37:34.477 --> 00:37:36.058]  And they saw what I said on Friday.
[00:37:37.019 --> 00:37:38.461]  They saw what Roger said on Friday.
[00:37:38.801 --> 00:37:40.923]  The video of it is on Bandot Video.
[00:37:41.323 --> 00:37:48.030]  Where I said, Trump is currently saying he looks to declare on July 4th.
[00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:49.151]  We don't know if that's going to happen.
[00:37:50.316 --> 00:37:50.796]  But here it is.
[00:37:50.876 --> 00:37:57.781]  Breaking conspiracy theorist Alex Jones claims that Donald Trump plans to announce a run for 2024 White House on July 4th.
[00:37:58.321 --> 00:37:59.962]  RT if you've never voted for Trump.
[00:38:01.764 --> 00:38:02.724]  There's a bunch of headlines.
[00:38:02.824 --> 00:38:07.648]  Trump eyes early 2024 announcement that January 6th scrutiny intensifies.
[00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:14.993]  So that's the type of stuff that we're dealing with here.
[00:38:16.293 --> 00:38:18.395]  And that's how they're going to try to spin this and control this.
[00:38:19.827 --> 00:38:23.170]  But obviously they're going after Trump because they're worried he's going to run.
[00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:35.479]  And they're messing with him and attacking him and doing all this is what will probably trigger or launch or precipitate him actually doing that.
[00:38:36.857 --> 00:38:38.298]  And I got mixed feelings about that.
[00:38:38.738 --> 00:38:45.423]  I'm mad at him about the poison vaccine and a lot of other stuff, but I'm glad about Roe v. Wade and the border and standing up for China, and so it's a mixed bag.
[00:38:45.963 --> 00:38:47.044]  But hey, we're not a cult here.
[00:38:47.364 --> 00:38:49.485]  We're not mad at listeners if you're angry at Trump.
[00:38:50.006 --> 00:38:52.107]  We're not mad at listeners if you love Trump.
[00:38:53.008 --> 00:38:56.170]  He certainly means well, and I don't think he's a bad person.
[00:38:57.079 --> 00:38:58.580]  People say, don't trust Ron DeSantis.
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:38:59.821]  Well, I go off of Tree's Fruits.
[00:39:00.281 --> 00:39:01.162]  I really like DeSantis.
[00:39:01.702 --> 00:39:05.745]  But we can't just count on a Ron DeSantis or a Donald Trump to save us.
[00:39:05.985 --> 00:39:07.766]  We have to be engaged.
[00:39:08.246 --> 00:39:09.427]  We have to be involved.
[00:39:09.807 --> 00:39:11.128]  And we have to know the issues.
[00:39:11.248 --> 00:39:22.195]  And we have to say no to the people really running things, the global corporate system, a la Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, the New World Order, BlackRock, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs.
[00:39:23.376 --> 00:39:26.418]  So that's where we are right now.
[00:39:27.273 --> 00:39:28.594]  In this country and in this world.
[00:39:29.275 --> 00:39:38.144]  Now, Bolsonaro, I've said clearly, is better than Viktor Orban, he's better than Donald Trump, and he's better than Ron DeSantis.
[00:39:39.511 --> 00:39:49.515]  If you want somebody who takes on the New World Order, and that tells it like it is to his people, and calls out the whole damn thing, it's Bolsonaro.
[00:39:49.575 --> 00:39:58.099]  And I am so honored he's a listener, so honored to meet his son that's a member of their Congress, that invited me down there two years ago to interview him, and I'm so tied down here with fights and everything.
[00:39:58.619 --> 00:39:59.259]  Also, money.
[00:39:59.319 --> 00:40:03.601]  I don't have money to have three or four security I gotta have and to get down to Brazil and do that.
[00:40:03.641 --> 00:40:04.762]  I mean, I probably should have done it.
[00:40:05.182 --> 00:40:07.603]  I'm an adventurer, but I'm so tied down.
[00:40:07.643 --> 00:40:13.765]  I can do so much here at the InfoWars command base that if we weren't trying to right the ship and keep the ship from going down, I would have been down there.
[00:40:14.005 --> 00:40:20.768]  But I'm glad that Tucker Carlson accepted the invitation this whole week and knocked it out of the parks.
[00:40:20.788 --> 00:40:21.829]  We had one of those big interviews.
[00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:27.775]  He's done down there coming up next segment, and we've got so much more into the second hour tonight.
[00:40:28.436 --> 00:40:29.818]  But let me just throw this out at you.
[00:40:30.619 --> 00:40:31.820]  I need your help to stay on air.
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:36.865]  And I try to bring you things that I know you need and that I personally have bought and things I've used.
[00:40:36.885 --> 00:40:40.249]  I only give you advice that I believe is the very best there is.
[00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:41.250]  My perfect no.
[00:40:42.051 --> 00:40:43.231]  But I'm going to say something.
[00:40:43.852 --> 00:40:49.834]  You are insane if you don't buy high-quality, storable food that's ready to ship to you and your family.
[00:40:50.454 --> 00:40:57.356]  As I told people 30 months ago to do, and now food prices have doubled on average, our supplier's only gone up 20%.
[00:40:58.217 --> 00:40:59.717]  But they will go up in prices soon.
[00:40:59.737 --> 00:41:04.539]  If you go to preparetoday.com, it's the entire MyPatriot catalog in live time, their back end.
[00:41:04.919 --> 00:41:05.919]  That way it gets to you even quicker.
[00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:10.141]  You make your order, and we get 20% to 40% because there's not much markup in this.
[00:41:11.408 --> 00:41:11.968]  The average is about 30%.
[00:41:12.329 --> 00:41:15.552]  We split the profit that's there to be able to run our operations.
[00:41:16.532 --> 00:41:19.795]  Not even profit, it's just the gross to be able to run the operation.
[00:41:20.396 --> 00:41:21.897]  So go to preparetoday.com.
[00:41:22.337 --> 00:41:29.844]  They have the full spectrum with the lowest prices, hundreds of survival goods, air filters, water filters, highest quality durable food, ready to ship.

[00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:38.031]  Just a link to it.
[00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:40.851]  Is ready to ship right now.
[00:41:40.911 --> 00:41:43.433]  Again, for almost four months, did I promote Swirlable Food?
[00:41:44.154 --> 00:41:45.535]  Didn't have a Swirlable Food sponsor.
[00:41:45.955 --> 00:41:47.737]  Our main sponsor was behind.
[00:41:48.017 --> 00:41:48.917]  They bought a ton of food.
[00:41:48.997 --> 00:41:49.398]  It's ready.
[00:41:49.438 --> 00:41:49.878]  It's shipping.
[00:41:50.178 --> 00:41:52.040]  So they said, hey, we're a few weeks behind.
[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:53.201]  Might want to back off.
[00:41:53.441 --> 00:41:54.382]  We want people to get it right away.
[00:41:54.662 --> 00:41:55.743]  But the food's there.
[00:41:56.403 --> 00:41:58.765]  And they're ready to ship right now to you and your family.
[00:41:59.165 --> 00:42:00.887]  And then with inflation, it's only going to go up.
[00:42:00.907 --> 00:42:04.370]  Ladies and gentlemen, you know, you've got that food lockdown that lasts more than a decade.
[00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:06.311]  It's high quality, nutritious and delicious.
[00:42:06.472 --> 00:42:07.913]  And, you know, in front of the show.
[00:42:07.953 --> 00:42:09.914]  So go to prepare today dot com.

[00:42:34.802 --> 00:42:36.443]  Just because why have the middleman?
[00:42:36.503 --> 00:42:37.203]  They just run it.
[00:42:37.523 --> 00:42:38.043]  They have it.
[00:42:38.284 --> 00:42:38.984]  We get the credit.

[00:42:48.809 --> 00:42:49.289]  Don't wait.
[00:42:49.329 --> 00:42:50.089]  Don't screw around.
[00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:54.912]  See it as a donation where you get food and have that insurance policy taken care of.
[00:42:55.012 --> 00:42:55.732]  Insurance you can eat.
[00:42:56.112 --> 00:42:57.153]  PrepareToday.com.

[00:42:59.173 --> 00:43:10.054]  Stay with us.
[00:43:10.327 --> 00:43:14.349]  The globalists are destroying our freedoms today, but humanity's waking up.

[00:44:55.190 --> 00:45:07.588]  Josh in FEMA Region 3, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:45:07.588 --> 00:45:10.469]  Alex, it's an honor to talk to you.
[00:45:10.885 --> 00:45:11.265]  Yes, sir.
[00:45:11.465 --> 00:45:13.226]  Real quick, I just want to plug X2.
[00:45:13.386 --> 00:45:15.568]  Man, I've been taking it for the last month and a half.
[00:45:15.828 --> 00:45:17.349]  It's made amazing changes.
[00:45:17.429 --> 00:45:18.549]  I started dreaming again.
[00:45:18.789 --> 00:45:20.510]  It's just, it's amazing.
[00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:22.011]  I just feel better.
[00:45:22.131 --> 00:45:23.512]  Like, it's hard to explain.
[00:45:23.532 --> 00:45:25.593]  I feel like I'm more hydrated.
[00:45:25.613 --> 00:45:26.373]  I'm a roofer.
[00:45:26.494 --> 00:45:29.875]  It normally takes a lot of water to stay hydrated for me.
[00:45:29.995 --> 00:45:31.756]  It feels like I'm retaining water better.
[00:45:31.816 --> 00:45:33.597]  Like I said, I started dreaming again.
[00:45:33.617 --> 00:45:34.838]  I haven't had a dream in two years.
[00:45:35.498 --> 00:45:35.758]  15 years.
[00:45:36.619 --> 00:45:40.180]  And two weeks after taking it, I was starting to dream every single night.
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:42.341]  Well, this isn't some New Age thing.
[00:45:42.401 --> 00:45:43.462]  They just piggyback on it.
[00:45:43.922 --> 00:45:48.604]  The pineal gland gets filled with fluoride, and that's the third eye, literally.
[00:45:48.764 --> 00:45:54.146]  It's connected to higher dreaming, higher consciousness medically, and then obviously the ancients said spiritual connection.
[00:45:54.286 --> 00:45:59.088]  And when it gets filled with fluoride and bromide and bromine, all the bad allergens, then people don't dream.
[00:45:59.228 --> 00:46:01.449]  And they don't have higher consciousness, statistically.
[00:46:02.049 --> 00:46:04.731]  Real iodine goes through and just burns all that out.
[00:46:04.831 --> 00:46:06.232]  It doesn't just get in there.
[00:46:06.332 --> 00:46:08.754]  It removes the bad stuff in the major studies.
[00:46:08.814 --> 00:46:10.275]  That's why everybody should get X2.
[00:46:10.355 --> 00:46:13.237]  We have a limited supply of it at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:46:13.417 --> 00:46:17.279]  It is, ladies and gentlemen, 40% off right now, though it's about to sell out.
[00:46:17.299 --> 00:46:18.921]  Get your X2 at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:46:18.941 --> 00:46:20.442]  Takes about 15 days to kick in.
[00:46:20.402 --> 00:46:37.402]   information. Info work store .com. Etched too. For the longest man, I try to tell you, well, it's all just right.
[00:46:37.599 --> 00:46:39.880]  If we're going down, we ain't going down without a fight.
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:40.880]  But we ain't going down.
[00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:42.561]  The globalists are going down, that's right.
[00:46:42.681 --> 00:46:45.362]  You can see into the future watching Alex Jones play.
[00:46:45.462 --> 00:46:46.342]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:46:46.402 --> 00:46:47.762]  Yeah, Alex Jones was right.
[00:46:47.782 --> 00:46:48.863]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:46:48.923 --> 00:46:50.323]  Yeah, Alex Jones was right.
[00:46:50.343 --> 00:46:51.404]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:46:51.464 --> 00:46:52.984]  Yeah, Alex Jones was right.
[00:46:53.004 --> 00:46:53.925]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:46:54.105 --> 00:46:55.345]  Yeah, Alex Jones was right.
[00:46:55.365 --> 00:46:56.966]  There's a war on for you, man.
[00:46:56.806 --> 00:46:58.806]  It's time to win it.
[00:46:58.806 --> 00:47:00.806]  No!
[00:47:01.806 --> 00:47:06.806]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order is...
[00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:08.988]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:08.988 --> 00:47:19.748]  And we are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:19.748 --> 00:47:23.949]  I've stopped looking for questions.
[00:47:23.949 --> 00:47:25.589]  I've got.
[00:47:25.717 --> 00:47:30.919]  So, I've seen a meme going around everywhere, in my text messages, my email box, Twitter, Facebook, everywhere, without even looking.
[00:47:32.213 --> 00:47:44.296]  People say Ghislaine Maxwell is convicted of trafficking thousands of children, little girls and women, but nobody's been charged for actually having sex with these children.
[00:47:45.357 --> 00:47:51.318]  So the good news is, no matter what they try, this globalist blackmail operation is being exposed.
[00:47:51.338 --> 00:48:00.941]  I have a clip here of UFC middleweight champion Israel Adesanya, if I'm pronouncing that right, making this point.
[00:48:00.981 --> 00:48:01.361]  Here it is.
[00:48:03.476 --> 00:48:05.539]  Galen Maxwell just got put away for 20 years.
[00:48:06.441 --> 00:48:10.027]  So she was supplying kids for these fucking pedos, right?
[00:48:10.768 --> 00:48:11.509]  Where's the list?
[00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:14.093]  Is it as that just gets, like...
[00:48:15.239 --> 00:48:15.519]  I don't know.
[00:48:15.539 --> 00:48:18.201]  It's kind of weird that that got no coverage, but Johnny Depp and Amber was everywhere.
[00:48:18.241 --> 00:48:18.981]  Everywhere, yeah.
[00:48:19.022 --> 00:48:26.686]  And I'm like, so the list of, you know, politicians and actresses and actors or whatever that they talked about, does that get swept under the rug?
[00:48:26.867 --> 00:48:29.228]  Do they not get any time before actually fucking those kids?
[00:48:30.189 --> 00:48:30.649]  You know what I mean?
[00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:31.269]  Like, I don't know.
[00:48:31.310 --> 00:48:33.691]  Like, that's weird how that just doesn't compute with me.
[00:48:35.092 --> 00:48:39.555]  You have Steve Jobs' wife, his heir, that runs The Atlantic Magazine.
[00:48:41.206 --> 00:48:44.068]  Literally, basically living at the compound with Ghislaine Maxwell.
[00:48:44.108 --> 00:48:45.008]  Photographed all of it.
[00:48:46.529 --> 00:48:50.431]  And see, that's how they blackmail the ruling global elite, is they were all part of this.
[00:48:51.912 --> 00:48:53.593]  That's why this continues to roll on.
[00:48:53.873 --> 00:48:55.154]  But let's have some fun here.
[00:48:55.234 --> 00:49:00.617]  Folks made the joke that... Steven Crowder made the joke that Jen Psaki is on the loose.
[00:49:00.637 --> 00:49:07.742]  This was probably a staged video on the New York subway, but a midget dressed up as Chucky, running around attacking people.
[00:49:09.323 --> 00:49:09.823]  So there you go.
[00:49:13.134 --> 00:49:21.996]  Again, radio listeners are not being treated to this, but this is Chucky attacking people on the New York subway.
[00:49:24.017 --> 00:49:28.438]  But let me show you here in a moment what is really scary that's going on.
[00:49:28.478 --> 00:49:38.400]  Here is Pope New World Order Francis with Pelosi, and the joke says, by Zaid Smith, someone said, this is a picture of the devil and the mafia.
[00:49:41.704 --> 00:49:44.686]  Meanwhile, this is Ross Ulbricht.
[00:49:45.167 --> 00:49:47.348]  He founded the website Silk Road.
[00:49:47.388 --> 00:49:49.410]  He was given two life sentences plus 40 years.
[00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:54.313]  Ghislaine Maxwell was given 20 years for his text, Trafficking and Kidnapping Children to Politicians and Celebrities.
[00:49:54.734 --> 00:49:58.777]  This should tell you everything you need to know about the government.
[00:49:59.277 --> 00:50:02.720]  And meanwhile, I followed her account before Isabella Maria DeLuca.
[00:50:03.414 --> 00:50:08.054]   tweeted out, "I will get married, I will own a farm, and I will homeschool my future children."
[00:50:08.054 --> 00:50:13.333]   She was fired from her job for making that pro-human statement.
[00:50:13.333 --> 00:50:17.333]   All right, let's go ahead and go to this powerful interview with the president of Brazil,
[00:50:17.333 --> 00:50:19.735]  and Tucker Carlson will be back in hour number two.
[00:50:19.735 --> 00:50:22.054]  Why didn't you take the vaccine?
[00:50:22.054 --> 00:50:33.614]   When the virus actually hit strongly in March 2020, People began to seek out the vaccine, of course, against
[00:50:33.614 --> 00:50:34.215]  the virus.
[00:50:34.376 --> 00:50:43.219]  And I, too, of course, sought a medication, because we began to see cases surfacing, started seeing the number of cases begin to go up.
[00:50:44.099 --> 00:50:48.200]  Now, someone who contracts the virus, like I did, I mean, the vaccine doesn't really help.
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:53.282]  I mean, you don't take a vaccine if you have already been contaminated.
[00:50:54.286 --> 00:50:55.867]  The vaccine would be innocuous.
[00:50:57.227 --> 00:50:59.048]  You should rather take the medication.
[00:51:00.028 --> 00:51:02.068]  And in Brazil, of course, I studied the issue.
[00:51:02.929 --> 00:51:18.454]  I called other countries, including in sub-Saharan Africa, and Brazilian doctors and physicians, because there were people out there who either did not catch the virus, or when they did catch the virus, the virus was not strong enough to send them to the hospital or to kill them.
[00:51:20.075 --> 00:51:24.497]  And in Brazil, we saw the emergence of two medications that began to be used more widely.
[00:51:27.518 --> 00:51:29.159]  I myself took them when contaminated.
[00:51:30.079 --> 00:51:37.842]  But the global pressure all over the world from the media outlets, from the pharmaceutical companies, I mean, they were all against the early treatment.
[00:51:38.462 --> 00:51:40.843]  They actually focused on the vaccine.
[00:51:41.264 --> 00:51:49.567]  I read Pfizer's contract, and one of the clauses said, we shall take no responsibility whatsoever for any side effect arising from the vaccine.
[00:51:50.901 --> 00:51:52.082]  I became concerned about that.
[00:51:53.122 --> 00:52:05.011]  And Congress in Brazil decided to vote and pass a piece of legislation saying that Pfizer or any other pharmaceutical company would not take responsibility for any side effect arising from the vaccine.
[00:52:05.051 --> 00:52:12.837]  We also had information, including from the US FDA, that several side effects are likely to emerge this year or next year in the foreseeable future.
[00:52:16.501 --> 00:52:25.486]  So, the concern, as mentioned by many doctors, was that people who were infected by the virus were already immune and did not have to take the vaccine.
[00:52:26.066 --> 00:52:26.807]  That was my case.
[00:52:27.367 --> 00:52:29.408]  That's why I did not take the vaccine.
[00:52:30.189 --> 00:52:32.470]  But I did purchase vaccines for all Brazilians.
[00:52:33.370 --> 00:52:35.932]  I did not demand that people be vaccinated.
[00:52:35.952 --> 00:52:37.513]  I respected individual freedom.
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:41.046]  Each one was free to vaccinate or not.
[00:52:41.768 --> 00:52:46.501]  And I believe that about 20% of the Brazilian population decided not to take the vaccine.
[00:52:48.647 --> 00:53:02.132]  As I said before, maybe I was the only head of state in the world who did not accept restrictive measures, or was against restrictive measures, and perhaps one of the few heads of state in the world who did not take the vaccine because I had already contracted the virus.
[00:53:02.752 --> 00:53:07.134]  The left was so worried about taking me out of office that they wanted me to take the vaccine.
[00:53:07.294 --> 00:53:09.055]  And I said, well, let me die.
[00:53:09.475 --> 00:53:12.256]  Just let me die, then, and choose my policy.
[00:53:14.110 --> 00:53:19.713]  In South America, we are the one country that best addressed the issue involving the need for vaccines.
[00:53:20.514 --> 00:53:25.657]  And we very properly and adequately equipped our hospitals with equipment and medications.
[00:53:26.497 --> 00:53:29.479]  And I believe we have pretty much turned the page there.
[00:53:29.799 --> 00:53:39.664]  And based on the studies that we have available outside of Brazil, many deaths could have been avoided had there not been so much pressure on the part of the mainstream media against early treatment.
[00:53:42.138 --> 00:53:52.265]  Early last year, I sent a team to Israel, a team of Brazilian experts to Israel to look into the nasal spray solution they had developed on an experimental basis.
[00:53:52.985 --> 00:53:57.468]  I was highly criticized and we weren't able to make progress in that negotiation.
[00:53:58.569 --> 00:54:07.115]  Last month, a large Brazilian company published a news article indicating that nasal sprays are currently a very successful solution against COVID today.
[00:54:07.995 --> 00:54:14.980]  So you are technically allowed, of course, to take an experimental vaccine, which was the case in the past, but not the nasal spray?
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:18.822]  I think you're the only world leader to admit not taking the vaccine, that's for sure.
[00:54:19.703 --> 00:54:28.248]  Why would Pfizer or any pharma company have liability protection against the side effects of their own drugs?
[00:54:28.429 --> 00:54:31.791]  Why would your Congress allow them to have that?
[00:54:31.811 --> 00:54:33.452]  The population was appalled.
[00:54:35.836 --> 00:54:42.813]  They were desperate and afraid of the virus, especially the elderly population that also had some kind of disease or comorbidity.
[00:54:43.633 --> 00:54:46.876]  As a result of which, Congress decided to pass a law to that effect.
[00:54:48.377 --> 00:54:49.918]  We regret it, really.
[00:54:50.579 --> 00:55:01.548]  Because today, in hindsight, you know, we see in studies, you know, conducted outside of Brazil, that perhaps two-thirds of deaths could have been avoided in Brazil and in the world.
[00:55:01.628 --> 00:55:03.149]  I mean, take Sub-Saharan Africa.
[00:55:03.169 --> 00:55:09.234]  In Sub-Saharan Africa, they take ivermectin to fight river blindness, as well as hydroxychloroquine to fight malaria.
[00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:25.658]  Because the number of deaths was very low and the HDI was pretty low, one of the lowest in the world, the natural conclusion was that those medications could somehow also help fight the virus and the effects thereof.
[00:55:25.718 --> 00:55:34.182]  We regret the pressure that took place and perhaps due to the economic power of pharmaceutical companies, I mean, they went on and invested in vaccines.
[00:55:34.962 --> 00:55:43.571]   And today you see, you know, People who have taken the third, the fourth dose of the vaccine and they still contract the virus and die.
[00:55:46.523 --> 00:55:49.105]  We have a lot of, say, stranded vaccines in Brazil.
[00:55:49.125 --> 00:55:55.268]  In Brazil, a considerable portion of the population did not want to take the booster dose.
[00:55:55.468 --> 00:55:56.629]  I understand that to be their right.
[00:55:57.329 --> 00:55:59.891]  I support individual freedom.
[00:55:59.991 --> 00:56:01.952]  As I said before, we are sorry.
[00:56:02.312 --> 00:56:03.312]  We regret all the deaths.
[00:56:04.533 --> 00:56:07.735]  But I believe many deaths could have been avoided through early treatment.
[00:56:09.139 --> 00:56:13.927]  Much is said about lack of scientific evidence about those two medications for COVID.
[00:56:14.007 --> 00:56:14.208]  True.
[00:56:14.228 --> 00:56:17.033]  But they were useful for other things.
[00:56:17.694 --> 00:56:20.980]  I mean, very often drugs or medications are discovered by chance.
[00:56:21.954 --> 00:56:30.600]  During World War II, for example, due to a lack of medication, soldiers were given coconut water in their vein and they survived.
[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:41.068]  As I said before, very often medications are discovered out of accident or, you know, sheer chance, including medications against or to treat sexual impotence, for example.
[00:56:41.088 --> 00:56:45.551]  Viagra.
[00:56:46.131 --> 00:56:47.012]  Viagra.
[00:56:47.052 --> 00:56:49.974]  So we... Where do you think the COVID virus came from?
[00:56:52.389 --> 00:56:55.832]  Well, allegedly from a laboratory on the other side of the world.
[00:56:56.373 --> 00:57:00.557]  But no deep investigation or no in-depth investigation has been conducted.
[00:57:01.557 --> 00:57:05.081]  It would seem that COVID has proved to be of interest for many people in the world.
[00:57:05.601 --> 00:57:10.165]  Many heads of state ended up imposing their will and they felt the taste of dictatorship.
[00:57:11.306 --> 00:57:16.771]  In Brazil, state governance felt the taste of acting as dictators by mandating that people should stay at home.
[00:57:17.586 --> 00:57:22.129]  And shutting down shops and not allowing people to go to school if they had not been vaccinated.
[00:57:22.849 --> 00:57:24.410]  So they felt that power in their hands.
[00:57:25.131 --> 00:57:26.432]  They could do everything during COVID.
[00:57:27.012 --> 00:57:42.242]  And more importantly, when it came to the public wheel itself, I mean, many things could be purchased by governors and mayors, although many of them, or the vast majority are honest, they were nevertheless able to buy just about anything without much of a sense of responsibility.
[00:57:43.075 --> 00:57:50.384]  So that taste of not being accountable for your actions during COVID is something that flourished among many top officials in Brazil.
[00:57:51.045 --> 00:57:56.392]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here.
[00:57:57.533 --> 00:58:00.477]  And that's what people recognize and resonate with.
[00:58:01.354 --> 00:58:04.595]  And as Ward said, you're not going to find a better place for information.
[00:58:04.895 --> 00:58:06.075]  You might not agree with everything.
[00:58:06.556 --> 00:58:09.636]  You might not agree with all our perspectives, but we cover all the information.
[00:58:10.377 --> 00:58:12.737]  And there's nowhere else, really, that does it like we do here.
[00:58:12.817 --> 00:58:13.598]  Thank you for that, Ward.
[00:58:13.998 --> 00:58:15.678]  Infowarsstore.com, by the way.
[00:58:16.198 --> 00:58:17.079]  Products he mentions.
[00:58:17.239 --> 00:58:19.139]  Infowarsstore.com is where to get them, folks.
[00:58:19.219 --> 00:58:20.820]  And we do have the best supplements.
[00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:29.305]   I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information, We do the best with our supplements as well.
[00:58:29.325 --> 00:58:31.865]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula.
[00:58:32.045 --> 00:58:33.306]  Folks, this is a joke.
[00:58:33.626 --> 00:58:34.906]  I mean, we're giving this thing away.
[00:58:34.946 --> 00:58:36.126]  It's 75% off.
[00:58:36.426 --> 00:58:38.787]  By the way, it works for me, in case you haven't noticed.
[00:58:39.007 --> 00:58:42.408]  The hair and beard formula is working for me.
[00:58:42.888 --> 00:58:44.708]  Quite well, I might add.
[00:58:45.129 --> 00:58:45.929]  Quite well.
[00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:49.110]  My barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:50.470]  I go and see him quite often now.
[00:58:51.130 --> 00:58:57.035]  At this point, best case scenario is a few years of hard times for us all.
[00:58:57.595 --> 00:59:00.958]  And if we don't turn it around soon, then it will only get worse.
[00:59:01.838 --> 00:59:05.541]  But as bad as things are, we still have time to prepare.
[00:59:06.262 --> 00:59:08.524]  And that alone is something to be grateful for.
[00:59:09.224 --> 00:59:16.393]  A gravity water filter will provide you with clean, healthy water, even in the event of your taps getting shut off.
[00:59:17.093 --> 00:59:21.819]  And having your own food will save you from getting ensnared in government FEMA camps.
[00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:28.707]  And if you've already stocked up enough for your own family, you might want to consider stocking up for your neighbors.
[00:59:29.768 --> 00:59:39.471]  Some of your neighbors might not be prepared for what's coming, but you can help them by having an abundance of storable foods and water filtration.
[00:59:40.051 --> 00:59:43.752]  Whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.

[00:59:51.874 --> 00:59:56.374]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:56.374 --> 00:59:58.374]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:59:58.374 --> 01:00:22.374]  [music]
[01:00:22.374 --> 01:00:25.374]   Alright, we're going deep down the rabbit hole on this Roe v. Wade decision.
[01:00:25.374 --> 01:00:31.063]   Some of the other big decisions that just happened that are very good for the Second Amendment and the right of free
[01:00:31.063 --> 01:00:31.374]  speech.
[01:00:31.374 --> 01:00:35.374]   Not just the right of children to not be butchered in their mother's wombs.
[01:00:35.374 --> 01:00:41.374]   And the pushback of the left with one of the top experts, the founder and head of LifeSite News,
[01:00:41.374 --> 01:00:43.374]  going to be joining us.
[01:00:42.730 --> 01:00:46.537]   But I wanted to go Another one of these compilations we've done.
[01:00:46.577 --> 01:00:47.739]  We've got probably 20 of them.
[01:00:48.299 --> 01:00:49.881]  We just played one from about four years ago.
[01:00:49.901 --> 01:00:53.526]  Here's one from about a year ago or less that Rob New put together.
[01:00:53.546 --> 01:00:58.091]  And we've got a new compilation bottom of the hour of the stuff happening at the pedophile parades.
[01:00:58.392 --> 01:00:58.852]  That's what they are.
[01:00:58.872 --> 01:00:59.693]  They're not gay parades.
[01:01:00.154 --> 01:01:01.155]  They're pedophile parades.
[01:01:01.876 --> 01:01:03.298]  And so we're going to show that.
[01:01:03.638 --> 01:01:10.400]  These are celebrations of their war against innocence, and this cult saying they're taking over our children and our lives.
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.261]  So that compilation's being put together from what happened over the weekend.
[01:01:13.501 --> 01:01:15.741]  It's coming up at the bottom of the hour, but first, here's this report.
[01:01:16.402 --> 01:01:22.503]  We're gonna have a great night tonight, and for you people in Florida, we're gonna have a gay night.
[01:01:22.863 --> 01:01:22.963]  Gay!
[01:01:23.584 --> 01:01:23.704]  Gay!
[01:01:26.444 --> 01:01:26.985]  Gay!
[01:01:27.325 --> 01:01:27.425]  Gay!
[01:01:27.465 --> 01:01:29.085]  Hi there, Governor Kate Brown here.
[01:01:29.465 --> 01:01:31.626]  In Oregon, we say gay.
[01:01:32.389 --> 01:01:36.690]  Oregonians are welcoming of our LGBTQIA community members.
[01:01:37.090 --> 01:01:42.671]  We want to make sure that Oregon is a safe, inclusive, and welcoming place for all.
[01:01:43.231 --> 01:01:51.472]  This is the most cringe thing I've ever seen.
[01:01:51.552 --> 01:01:53.873]  All these psycho bombers.
[01:01:54.133 --> 01:01:57.653]  They're literally obsessed with sex.
[01:01:58.073 --> 01:01:59.134]  That's what a pervert does.
[01:01:59.154 --> 01:02:01.574]  I mean, these people are just crazy.
[01:02:02.892 --> 01:02:04.133]  And they want access to your children.
[01:02:03.972 --> 01:02:05.972]  They got access to them.
[01:02:05.972 --> 01:02:07.972]  We want no more debt!
[01:02:07.972 --> 01:02:09.972]  We want no more debt!
[01:02:09.972 --> 01:02:11.972]  We want no more debt!
[01:02:11.972 --> 01:02:13.972]  We want no more debt!
[01:02:13.972 --> 01:02:15.972]  We want no more debt!
[01:02:15.972 --> 01:02:17.972]  We want no more debt!
[01:02:17.972 --> 01:02:19.972]  We want no more debt!
[01:02:19.972 --> 01:02:21.972]  We want no more debt!
[01:02:21.972 --> 01:02:23.972]  We think we're sinful.
[01:02:23.541 --> 01:02:25.383]  You fight against our rights.
[01:02:25.563 --> 01:02:29.086]  You say we all lead lives you can't respect.
[01:02:29.306 --> 01:02:31.828]  We'll convert your children.
[01:02:32.508 --> 01:02:34.970]  Someone's gotta teach them not to hate.
[01:02:36.869 --> 01:02:43.855]  Turns out a bunch of these people were convicted child rapists, of course, in the San Francisco gay choir.
[01:02:44.675 --> 01:02:51.141]  Not a gay choir, it's a child rape organization, in my view.
[01:02:51.181 --> 01:02:53.443]  Child rape of their minds and their innocence.
[01:02:56.686 --> 01:02:59.287]  That's Austin right there.
[01:02:59.347 --> 01:03:05.870]  Men naked posing with children.
[01:03:05.810 --> 01:03:11.489]   And at the degeneration rate of this, they'll be raping children in the town square within
[01:03:11.489 --> 01:03:12.489]  one year.
[01:03:12.489 --> 01:03:13.489]  I'm excited and giving me hugs and everything.
[01:03:13.489 --> 01:03:14.489]  I started them young, right?
[01:03:14.489 --> 01:03:15.489]  Anyone can do drag.
[01:03:15.489 --> 01:03:15.489]  Everyone can do drag.
[01:03:15.489 --> 01:03:16.489]  I'm excited and giving me hugs and everything.
[01:03:16.489 --> 01:03:17.489]  I started them young, right?
[01:03:17.489 --> 01:03:18.489]  Anyone can do drag.
[01:03:18.489 --> 01:03:18.489]  Everyone can do drag.
[01:03:18.489 --> 01:03:23.489]  I'm excited and giving me hugs and everything.
[01:03:23.795 --> 01:03:26.795]  It keeps the children, it keeps the couple.
[01:03:26.795 --> 01:03:31.795]   But you don't have to worry, Because there's nothing wrong with standing by your side.
[01:03:31.795 --> 01:03:33.795]  Get on board and get a hurry.
[01:03:33.795 --> 01:03:37.795]   Strike should be an all-ages thing, and some people consider it provocative.
[01:03:37.795 --> 01:03:42.795]   But you don't have to worry, Because there's nothing wrong with standing by your side.
[01:03:42.795 --> 01:03:44.795]  Get on board and get a hurry.
[01:03:44.795 --> 01:03:47.795]  Because the world always seems out there for a ride.
[01:03:47.795 --> 01:03:49.795]  Come on, try a little.
[01:03:49.795 --> 01:03:54.795]  Try, we'll convert your children.
[01:03:54.795 --> 01:03:59.795]   Then we'll turn to you, Giving up the fear inside you,
[01:03:59.795 --> 01:04:02.795]  Screaming like you never knew.
[01:04:02.795 --> 01:04:05.795]  Go and see San Francisco.
[01:04:05.795 --> 01:04:07.795]  Go and turn up that disco.
[01:04:07.795 --> 01:04:12.795]  You'll forget you were ever upset.
[01:04:12.795 --> 01:04:15.795]  We'll convert your children.
[01:04:15.795 --> 01:04:19.795]  And make an ally of you.
[01:04:19.795 --> 01:04:21.795]  These are people that fell to Satan.
[01:04:22.381 --> 01:04:27.425]  These are soulless zombies now that only thought they're alive when they're destroying innocents.
[01:04:27.826 --> 01:04:29.006]  It should be very sad.
[01:04:29.067 --> 01:04:31.809]  We lost these people and we should not make fun of them.
[01:04:31.849 --> 01:04:34.371]  We should stand against them and protect our children from them.
[01:04:34.911 --> 01:04:37.253]  I'm pushing an overly sexualized agenda.
[01:04:37.514 --> 01:04:38.114]  Are you nervous?
[01:04:38.194 --> 01:04:38.294]  Yes.
[01:04:38.334 --> 01:04:39.996]  Do you want to touch my hair?
[01:04:40.336 --> 01:04:40.516]  No.
[01:04:40.856 --> 01:04:46.201]  And for the children and the people that support it are going to realize that this is going to be the grooming of the next generation.
[01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:52.310]  Yep, they go to city councils and they say we're grooming your children.
[01:04:53.232 --> 01:04:53.873]  They're ours.
[01:04:54.434 --> 01:04:56.177]  We're going to convince them to have their genitals cut off.
[01:04:56.578 --> 01:04:57.299]  We can't abort them.
[01:04:57.359 --> 01:04:58.601]  We'll cut their genitals off later.

[01:05:47.722 --> 01:05:55.481]   info war store dot com and celebrate July 4th 1776 part two against the new world order
[01:05:55.481 --> 01:06:16.922]   because the answer to 1984 is 1776 defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic
[01:06:17.063 --> 01:06:18.744]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:18.964 --> 01:06:30.047]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into hour number two on this live Monday, June 27th broadcast.
[01:06:30.627 --> 01:06:38.349]  We have a true warrior and a champion of the fight for the unborn and now the born, they're wanting to kill babies after they're born.
[01:06:40.003 --> 01:06:45.046]  A champion for life against euthanasia, against all of it, is John Henry Weston.
[01:06:45.706 --> 01:06:50.329]  And he, of course, heads up the great organization LifeSiteNews.
[01:06:50.349 --> 01:06:59.373]  He's been on with us many times, and I've been reading his website for more than a decade and covering the incredible information that they lay out at LifeSiteNews.com.
[01:07:00.993 --> 01:07:20.060]  And we couldn't get a better person on today to talk about this historic ruling last week and the responses to it and what the next phase of the battle is going to be, both by those drunk on the blood of the innocents and those of us whose hearts are convicted trying to stop it.
[01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:22.161]  The Democrats are now threatening civil war.
[01:07:23.217 --> 01:07:26.938]  They're now saying they're going to hand out morning after pills everywhere out of vending machines.
[01:07:27.298 --> 01:07:28.358]  That's going to be the new fight.
[01:07:28.399 --> 01:07:31.739]  Very toxic, very dangerous pills that can kill women.
[01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:34.720]  We've got all of this and more to discuss with him.
[01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:36.601]  And then it's all interconnected.
[01:07:36.781 --> 01:07:43.863]  The pedophile parades nationwide, parading children through the streets with naked men, eating feces, urinating on each other.
[01:07:44.083 --> 01:07:45.824]  Folks, we can't show you this on TV.
[01:07:45.864 --> 01:07:48.224]  We're on a lot of TV stations and cable stations.
[01:07:48.664 --> 01:07:53.644]   We can't show you this, but children are being subjected to it. So the stuff we showed you, if
[01:07:53.644 --> 01:07:59.214]   you think it was bad, earlier in the last hour is nothing. I literally have had
[01:07:59.214 --> 01:08:03.714]   nightmares in the last three days over having to review this stuff because it's one thing to see
[01:08:03.714 --> 01:08:11.644]   these sick, pedophile, pervert freaks dancing around, but little kids looking very upset, very
[01:08:11.644 --> 01:08:15.914]   threatened, with their parents shoving them into the arms of Moloch to have their
[01:08:15.914 --> 01:08:17.265]  innocence destroyed.
[01:08:17.445 --> 01:08:18.646]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:08:19.266 --> 01:08:21.769]  This is true mass demonic possession in my view.
[01:08:21.989 --> 01:08:22.689]  But I'm ranting.
[01:08:23.519 --> 01:08:30.542]  I appreciate John Henry Weston, the head of LiveSiteNews, LiveSiteNews.com, joining us, a real-world expert on this.
[01:08:30.863 --> 01:08:40.047]  It's got to be satisfying, after your decades and decades of this long fight, beating one of the leading, if not the leading, pro-LiveSite in the world, to see so much success happening.
[01:08:40.087 --> 01:08:41.248]  And so, thank you for joining us.
[01:08:41.268 --> 01:08:41.968]  Congratulations.
[01:08:43.549 --> 01:08:44.389]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:08:44.429 --> 01:08:45.049]  Good to be with you.
[01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:47.010]  Where do you want to start?
[01:08:48.431 --> 01:08:49.732]  Well, first of all, praise God.
[01:08:51.047 --> 01:08:53.047]  What an incredible thing.
[01:08:53.548 --> 01:08:54.768]  And who would have thought?
[01:08:55.728 --> 01:09:07.110]  I think realists, like you are, would have said, I don't know, even though, yes, we made some good appointments, but then there have been betrayals among the Supreme Court justices.
[01:09:08.331 --> 01:09:13.712]  But Trump gave us what we needed to get over the hump in terms of Supreme Court.
[01:09:14.852 --> 01:09:15.912]  But it was still incredible.
[01:09:16.452 --> 01:09:23.348]   When the leak came in May and the left went insane, There was a lot still on the table.
[01:09:23.808 --> 01:09:33.771]  We knew that should one of the justices be killed, which was a very real possibility, that the leaked ruling or the draft ruling wouldn't stand.
[01:09:34.571 --> 01:09:38.412]  And that's why we had an attempt on the life of Justice Kavanaugh.
[01:09:39.593 --> 01:09:57.861]   And it's incredible because truly what I think happened was the prayer that went into defending the lives of the justices and the prayer that has gone into Ending Roe v. Wade for 50 years has come true so that our Lord is able to now.
[01:09:57.881 --> 01:10:01.884]  You're going to see a very divided United States.
[01:10:03.826 --> 01:10:17.658]  You're going to have some states where the blood will continue to be shed, where the blood of the innocent, which cries to heaven for vengeance, as the scriptures say, will continue to flow.
[01:10:18.777 --> 01:10:32.244]  But in certain states, ten right off the bat, but another ten that are going to come online very soon, the protection of life of the innocent in their mother's womb is now protected by law the way it should be.
[01:10:33.344 --> 01:10:41.929]  All of a sudden, at least this basic element of civilization has been restored to a good part of the United States of America.
[01:10:43.109 --> 01:10:48.557]   So that God's blessing can once again flow But it's a divided America.
[01:10:49.518 --> 01:10:59.004]  You have all these other states which want to call themselves a sanctuary for abortion, where they're saying, please come, let us kill your children.
[01:10:59.944 --> 01:11:03.327]  They put it, of course, in their own terminology, but that's exactly what it is.
[01:11:04.207 --> 01:11:05.848]  So it's a divided America.
[01:11:06.649 --> 01:11:11.512]  And what the ruling does is it brings the battle to the states.
[01:11:12.586 --> 01:11:28.989]  No longer can the federal government force abortion on unwilling states so that in Alabama and other places where they want that the legislature was voted in to protect life, no longer can the federals just say, hey, you got to do it anyway.
[01:11:29.949 --> 01:11:33.310]  Most of your people, the vast majority of your people want to protect life.
[01:11:33.610 --> 01:11:34.090]  Tough luck.
[01:11:34.510 --> 01:11:36.130]  We're going to kill your babies anyhow.
[01:11:36.170 --> 01:11:37.110]  We're going to legalize it.
[01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:38.070]  No, no more.
[01:11:38.991 --> 01:11:41.171]  Now the states get to decide for themselves.
[01:11:42.228 --> 01:11:44.389]  So the battle is there now at the state level.
[01:11:45.069 --> 01:11:52.012]  There's a lot of work to be done and the work to be done is not only at the legislative level.
[01:11:52.172 --> 01:12:09.900]  It's also obviously working to change minds and hearts to support women who find themselves in troubled pregnancies and unexpected pregnancies to educate people on abstinence and on the reality of marriage and everything else that leads to life and this great gift of sexuality, which is meant for procreation.
[01:12:10.999 --> 01:12:12.440]  And to bring it all back to normalcy.
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.261]  So we need to get there.
[01:12:14.381 --> 01:12:20.864]  There's a lot of work to be done, but an amazing first step, because while some people say, oh, it does nothing, it does nothing.
[01:12:21.385 --> 01:12:31.050]  Actually, it does something because the law, in addition to what it is on its face in terms of protection and police powers, is also a teacher.
[01:12:31.810 --> 01:12:46.443]   So the very fact that laws are now on the books in many states that protect life from conception, We'll teach people that, once again, the value of life is real, and it should be protected.
[01:12:46.463 --> 01:12:48.124]  It should be protected in law.
[01:12:48.925 --> 01:12:52.928]  I'm not a theologian like you and many of your crew are.
[01:12:52.988 --> 01:12:56.588]   I know you're just immersed in it, but I remember Sunday school and reading the Bible, and it
[01:12:56.588 --> 01:13:01.907]   just seems like common sense to me that God wanted governments to have righteous rules
[01:13:01.907 --> 01:13:06.708]   and God would hold it against the population, even if a lot of the population was good,
[01:13:06.708 --> 01:13:09.667]  if the government was carrying out evil.
[01:13:09.667 --> 01:13:13.427]   And then if the people didn't oppose it, they would then basically not receive the blessings
[01:13:13.427 --> 01:13:14.427]  of God anymore.
[01:13:14.427 --> 01:13:16.248]  And that's how I see this.
[01:13:16.248 --> 01:13:19.427]   It divides the wheat from the chaff, the goats from the sheep.
[01:13:19.427 --> 01:13:25.067]   It'll bring the evil of these people out in the open and how horrible they act and the
[01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:29.027]   simulation of killing children and them admitting it's about killing babies.
[01:13:29.027 --> 01:13:33.467]   And really the operating system of the Democrats is now overtly Satanistic and getting more
[01:13:33.467 --> 01:13:35.148]  intense.
[01:13:35.148 --> 01:13:39.467]   And so that bringing out this evil will then further convict other people's hearts to really
[01:13:39.467 --> 01:13:42.667]   wake up and understand this is a battle between good and evil.
[01:13:42.667 --> 01:13:47.667]   And so I do see this as a gigantic victory, as you were saying, moving us really fast
[01:13:47.667 --> 01:13:48.667]  in the right direction.
[01:13:48.667 --> 01:13:52.667]  Trump was far from perfect, but his grand, amazing...
[01:13:53.506 --> 01:13:54.107]  Uh, victory.
[01:13:54.447 --> 01:14:07.160]  His supreme legacy, regardless of what happens to Trump in the future, is that he said he would do this in that debate six years ago with Hillary, and he delivered on it, and it happened, and that makes Trump amazing and a blessing and an incredible man.
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:08.642]  You judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:14:09.062 --> 01:14:10.864]  No way Trump's bad doing something like that.
[01:14:12.569 --> 01:14:13.590]  Well, absolutely so.
[01:14:14.010 --> 01:14:15.290]  What an incredible gift.
[01:14:15.551 --> 01:14:28.617]  If he did absolutely nothing else, that would have been worth it in spades, because the number of American children's lives he saved by those appointments will only be seen in the future, and it will redound to his own blessing.
[01:14:28.637 --> 01:14:31.959]  You know, there's a lot that Trump has to answer for, but you know what?
[01:14:31.999 --> 01:14:34.641]  This is going to work in his favor when he has to meet his maker.
[01:14:35.661 --> 01:14:39.143]  In terms of what you were talking about, it's very interesting.
[01:14:40.536 --> 01:14:45.940]  Yes, the bombing and firebombing of churches and vandalism and threats.
[01:14:47.141 --> 01:14:52.726]  And all of the hell that we're seeing break out because the demon has had a defeat and now he's flailing.
[01:14:52.746 --> 01:15:10.479]   And as you put it in his minions, these aren't so much, these are people who are lost, that are given to Satan, the anger, the violence that is coming out of them right now, Hopefully, they'll look in the mirror and be able to see it for what it is and turn around.
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:18.804]  But the one effect that you mentioned that is so powerful is that others will get to see.
[01:15:19.885 --> 01:15:20.866]  Eyes will be opened.
[01:15:21.866 --> 01:15:24.508]  In a way, I think that right now it's not.
[01:15:25.368 --> 01:15:34.174]  People can see in the destruction of churches, in the vandalism, the firebombing, the threats to people's lives, the willingness to even commit murder.
[01:15:36.593 --> 01:15:46.176]  People will say, wait a minute, I thought this was a movement about choice and honoring women and these fetuses weren't children really.
[01:15:47.196 --> 01:15:55.219]  But all of a sudden, it's becoming clear, Satan is letting his guard down in order to whip up a frenzy.
[01:15:55.239 --> 01:15:57.659]  That's right, stay right there John Henry, you gotta come right back.
[01:15:57.759 --> 01:15:59.320]  This is incredibly important information.
[01:16:00.874 --> 01:16:02.937]  Infowars is fighting for you.
[01:16:03.818 --> 01:16:07.342]  Infowars is fighting for every basic freedom we've got.
[01:16:08.203 --> 01:16:08.904]  We're Americans.
[01:16:09.644 --> 01:16:15.271]  And we are not going to see our birthright destroyed by the globalists and their quote, liberal world order.
[01:16:15.792 --> 01:16:17.914]  That means devalued currencies, open borders.
[01:16:18.715 --> 01:16:21.617]  The disarmament of the average person while the elites have private bodyguards.
[01:16:21.957 --> 01:16:31.003]  The incredible pedophilic sexualization of our children with the entire drag queen pedophile time being pushed by Disney, Hollywood, and the Democratic Party.
[01:16:31.624 --> 01:16:34.245]  We stand against the future lockdowns they're openly planning.
[01:16:34.285 --> 01:16:38.528]  We stand against their World ID cards from the DeVos Group and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates.
[01:16:38.889 --> 01:16:43.332]  We stand against the forced injections with their deadly gene therapies.
[01:16:43.852 --> 01:16:45.993]  And more importantly, we don't just stand for those freedoms.
[01:16:46.454 --> 01:16:48.135]  We are the tip of the spear and we're winning.
[01:16:48.775 --> 01:16:55.441]  That means when you support InfoWars by spreading the word or buying great products at InfoWarsStore.com, you are the tip of the spear.
[01:16:55.881 --> 01:16:59.464]  So this July 4th, I want to salute you all and thank you for your ongoing support.
[01:16:59.885 --> 01:17:00.725]  You are this fight.
[01:17:00.745 --> 01:17:01.986]  Without you, we would have already lost.
[01:17:02.447 --> 01:17:12.354]   And I want to ask you again, To just think, this July 4th, about what America and the world would be like without you and your actions to fight tyranny and your support of InfoWars.
[01:17:12.814 --> 01:17:23.922]  So please, this July 4th, help us continue to re-declare our Declaration of Independence against the globalists and tyranny by visiting InfoWarsStore.com for the July Mega Blowout Sale.
[01:17:24.182 --> 01:17:26.164]  So far, the biggest of this year.

[01:17:33.029 --> 01:17:34.129]  Let me explain something.
[01:17:34.489 --> 01:17:41.093]  This hair and beard formula that I designed, that I think is great, that I think is amazing, this is something hardly anybody buys.
[01:17:41.833 --> 01:17:47.416]  Even though it's basically the same formula, maybe even better, than our whole food multivitamin that is incredible.
[01:17:47.716 --> 01:17:49.597]  This is a whole food multivitamin mineral.
[01:17:50.138 --> 01:17:51.058]  That's really what it is.
[01:17:51.438 --> 01:17:56.401]  And it's 75% off at InfoWarsTore.com right now.

[01:18:03.464 --> 01:18:06.605]  And again, I want to thank you all for your incredible support.
[01:18:07.525 --> 01:18:16.789]  And I want to encourage you to redouble your efforts to not just support InfoWars, to not just share the articles and videos as you've been doing, and then tell others to share them.
[01:18:17.529 --> 01:18:25.435]  But to also go to InfoWarsStore.com and get high quality products that will change your life and help keep us on the air.
[01:18:25.715 --> 01:18:30.354]   InfoWarsStore.com keeps InfoWars on the air and InfoWars is tomorrow's news today.
[01:18:30.354 --> 01:18:37.074]  Let's talk to Greg in Pennsylvania.
[01:18:37.203 --> 01:18:38.304]  Greg, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:18:38.504 --> 01:18:40.506]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:18:40.606 --> 01:18:44.690]  If I could real quick, I wanted to plug X2 and bodies.
[01:18:44.830 --> 01:18:47.072]  I'm 61, going to be 62 this year.
[01:18:47.212 --> 01:18:51.396]  I was feeling pretty old, 53, 54 years old, getting up slow.
[01:18:51.596 --> 01:18:58.142]  I had that brain fog going on and I started taking your supplements and wow, I can't live without them now.
[01:18:58.162 --> 01:18:59.704]  It's really great products.
[01:18:59.904 --> 01:19:01.665]  Well, elaborate on that.
[01:19:01.705 --> 01:19:03.126]  What InfoWars products did you take?
[01:19:03.146 --> 01:19:03.566]  What happened?
[01:19:03.746 --> 01:19:05.607]  Oh, I take the X2 every day.
[01:19:05.747 --> 01:19:07.808]  I have for probably six years.
[01:19:07.828 --> 01:19:10.090]  The bodies, I take every day.
[01:19:10.290 --> 01:19:21.916]  I use your Alpha Power, and I take the B12, the Ultra 12, and the Vitamin D. I take them all in the morning and in the evening, and I sleep great.
[01:19:21.996 --> 01:19:23.117]  My pain is gone.
[01:19:23.217 --> 01:19:24.798]  My back doesn't hurt anymore.
[01:19:24.858 --> 01:19:27.099]  I don't get up and have to, like, stretch.
[01:19:27.539 --> 01:19:28.780]  I just don't have that anymore.
[01:19:31.463 --> 01:19:39.251]  Well, exactly.
[01:19:39.291 --> 01:19:44.977]  The UN estimates 2 plus million people have cognitive disabilities or lower IQ because of lack of iodine.
[01:19:45.017 --> 01:19:49.582]  They took iodine out of salt, they put the poison fluoride and chloride in the water that's the opposite.
[01:19:49.782 --> 01:19:51.203]  And that's why this is pure iodine.
[01:19:51.243 --> 01:19:51.924]  Nobody else has.
[01:19:51.944 --> 01:19:54.126]  That's why X2 is so incredibly important.
[01:19:54.186 --> 01:19:56.448]  Everybody experience X2 for themselves.
[01:19:56.488 --> 01:19:57.949]  Takes about two weeks to kick in.
[01:19:58.149 --> 01:19:58.570]  X2.
[01:19:58.690 --> 01:19:59.771]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:20:02.313 --> 01:20:06.396]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:20:06.717 --> 01:20:13.717]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:13.717 --> 01:20:23.717]   We have literally hours and hours of Democrats right here in Austin this weekend saying,
[01:20:23.717 --> 01:20:24.717]  "I love Satan.
[01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:26.091]  I want to kill children.
[01:20:27.452 --> 01:20:30.633]  And you think, OK, they're just trying to freak you out.
[01:20:30.653 --> 01:20:31.994]  But we've infiltrated their meetings.
[01:20:32.494 --> 01:20:33.735]  We've played the undercover videos.
[01:20:34.235 --> 01:20:35.736]  Project Veritas has as well.
[01:20:36.697 --> 01:20:38.518]  They have really adopted Satanism.
[01:20:39.372 --> 01:20:44.395]  And a few years ago, uh, that, uh, Satanic Temple put out that movie, I think it's called Hail Satan.
[01:20:44.775 --> 01:20:55.000]  I went and saw it with my wife, and the audience at Alamo Draft House was full of people laughing at the Christians, cheering the Satanists, and saying Hail Satan, like they think it's cute and funny, but it's not a joke.
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:57.603]  They're actually taking it up.
[01:20:57.683 --> 01:21:01.428]  It's like a child pretending to be a police officer or a fireman, and then they become one later.
[01:21:01.989 --> 01:21:03.992]  Okay, I mean, it's all ha ha ha!
[01:21:04.232 --> 01:21:09.819]  And there's national articles about the fastest growing religion among Democrats and leftists is Satanism.
[01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:10.440]  Look it up!
[01:21:11.161 --> 01:21:16.023]  So, and these satanic churches admit it's a sacrament of sacrifice.
[01:21:16.043 --> 01:21:16.923]  We always told you that.
[01:21:17.203 --> 01:21:22.485]  This is deadly serious, and it's backed by the big corporations and by Disney and others.
[01:21:22.766 --> 01:21:27.447]  And this whole agenda of dehumanizing is run by the god of this world, the fallen.
[01:21:27.467 --> 01:21:31.169]  We're going to talk to one of the leading figures battling this evil, how historic this is in a moment.
[01:21:31.369 --> 01:21:33.430]  But here's just two clips, one from Saturday.
[01:21:33.970 --> 01:21:37.650]   with our reporters, Savannah Hernandez and Drew Hernandez, out front the Supreme Court.
[01:21:37.650 --> 01:21:40.530]   Just one clip of hundreds we got. This was part of the course.
[01:21:40.530 --> 01:21:47.130]   And then a clip from a few years ago of an abortion doctor sounding exactly the same with the "I hate the children, I
[01:21:47.130 --> 01:21:48.690]  want to kill the children." Here it is.
[01:21:48.690 --> 01:21:50.130]  Let's have a conversation. Calm down.
[01:21:50.130 --> 01:21:53.329]  Let's decide. No, let's not have a conversation.
[01:21:53.329 --> 01:21:53.970]  Calm down. Calm down, sir.
[01:21:53.970 --> 01:21:56.289]  You're this little son of shit.
[01:21:56.289 --> 01:21:58.849]  I guess the pandemic's over.
[01:22:03.406 --> 01:22:04.226]  You like killing babies?
[01:22:04.546 --> 01:22:05.366]  You love killing babies?
[01:22:05.386 --> 01:22:06.767]  I love killing babies.
[01:22:06.787 --> 01:22:08.127]  You love killing babies, huh?
[01:22:08.467 --> 01:22:09.428]  You love that, don't you?
[01:22:09.548 --> 01:22:10.188]  You love that.
[01:22:11.668 --> 01:22:12.809]  Sir, you gotta repent, sir.
[01:22:13.809 --> 01:22:16.210]  You gotta repent, sir, for murdering babies.
[01:22:18.190 --> 01:22:18.490]  Why?
[01:22:18.890 --> 01:22:20.791]  Because it's a sin before God.
[01:22:20.871 --> 01:22:21.331]  Why?
[01:22:22.051 --> 01:22:22.632]  Stinky breath.
[01:22:22.792 --> 01:22:24.772]  Yeah, that's pretty evil of you, sir.
[01:22:24.892 --> 01:22:25.452]  Yeah, I am.
[01:22:25.492 --> 01:22:26.653]  And I hope and pray that you...
[01:22:29.344 --> 01:22:30.505]  Well, that's what you do to babies, huh?
[01:22:30.545 --> 01:22:30.765]  Yeah.
[01:22:31.145 --> 01:22:31.525]  I love it.
[01:22:32.025 --> 01:22:32.525]  You love it, huh?
[01:22:32.545 --> 01:22:33.166]  Yeah, I do.
[01:22:33.186 --> 01:22:33.806]  Okay.
[01:22:34.066 --> 01:22:35.407]  I hope that you come to Christ, sir.
[01:22:35.607 --> 01:22:36.627]  Oh, I'd never go to Christ.
[01:22:36.647 --> 01:22:38.128]  I hope that you come to Christ, sir.
[01:22:38.148 --> 01:22:39.228]  No, I don't go to Christ.
[01:22:39.388 --> 01:22:40.889]  Yeah, you... I don't listen to Christ.
[01:22:40.929 --> 01:22:42.250]  You will have a darkened heart, sir.
[01:22:42.270 --> 01:22:43.490]  I do have a darkened heart.
[01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:43.910]  Yeah.
[01:22:43.930 --> 01:22:44.811]  You have a darkened heart.
[01:22:44.831 --> 01:22:44.991]  I do.
[01:22:45.071 --> 01:22:46.171]  I do very, very much so.
[01:22:46.231 --> 01:22:48.032]  And you will stand before God in judgment day?
[01:22:48.052 --> 01:22:48.633]  Yes, I will.
[01:22:49.033 --> 01:22:49.393]  Every day.
[01:22:49.773 --> 01:22:51.194]  You will stand before God and judge him.
[01:22:51.234 --> 01:22:51.834]  Yes, I will.
[01:22:51.934 --> 01:22:52.334]  Every day.
[01:22:52.354 --> 01:22:53.914]  All of the babies that you have to kill.
[01:22:53.934 --> 01:22:54.194]  I love it.
[01:22:54.214 --> 01:22:54.575]  I love it.
[01:22:54.715 --> 01:22:55.835]  Yeah, keep tearing the babies apart.
[01:22:55.855 --> 01:22:56.395]  Yeah, I will.
[01:22:56.575 --> 01:22:58.556]  Keep tearing the babies apart.
[01:22:58.636 --> 01:22:59.356]  I will.
[01:22:59.376 --> 01:23:00.677]  Keep tearing the babies apart.
[01:23:02.137 --> 01:23:02.517]  Yes, sir.
[01:23:02.557 --> 01:23:04.498]  The babies, their blood streams from the ground.
[01:23:04.518 --> 01:23:06.398]  Their blood streams from the ground.
[01:23:06.418 --> 01:23:07.319]  You are a murderer, sir.
[01:23:07.339 --> 01:23:08.239]  You gotta repent, sir.
[01:23:08.259 --> 01:23:13.921]  For any listeners that don't know, he's in his face hissing like a demon with a pair of scissors in his hand.
[01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:23.407]  And, ladies and gentlemen, if you don't believe me, I'm begging you, go to a pro-death rally, and these people are the majority.
[01:23:23.747 --> 01:23:24.668]  Not the minority now.
[01:23:24.788 --> 01:23:31.634]  Women, men, old people, young people, black people, brown people, but majority white people, literally hissing and acting like demons.
[01:23:31.974 --> 01:23:32.995]  You can't make this up.
[01:23:33.555 --> 01:23:36.638]  And we can't show you the footage of these pedophile pride parades.
[01:23:37.018 --> 01:23:38.540]  You gotta go to one for yourself.
[01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:39.521]  You gotta see it for yourself.
[01:23:39.961 --> 01:23:41.082]  It's so unbelievable.
[01:23:41.122 --> 01:23:42.563]  They're eating feces off the ground.
[01:23:43.524 --> 01:23:44.364]  I can't even say it on air.
[01:23:44.404 --> 01:23:46.785]  And I even feel evil repeating this stuff, folks.
[01:23:46.805 --> 01:23:47.625]  But you gotta know.
[01:23:48.025 --> 01:23:49.305]  So the poison's coming out.
[01:23:49.345 --> 01:23:50.245]  The world's seeing it.
[01:23:50.345 --> 01:23:52.786]  Very eloquent words by John Henry Weston.
[01:23:52.806 --> 01:23:54.446]  Everybody should visit lifesitenews.com.
[01:23:54.826 --> 01:23:57.347]  Next segment we'll have the floor, but I wanted to spend some time there.
[01:23:57.387 --> 01:24:01.527]  But in the five minutes we have left in the shorter segment, what do you make of what we just saw?
[01:24:01.567 --> 01:24:05.068]  Doesn't that illustrate what you're saying about the mask is coming off the demons?
[01:24:05.388 --> 01:24:10.709]  We see that in the Bible, historically, that when the devil starts losing, he drops the mask.
[01:24:12.426 --> 01:24:13.087]  It does indeed.
[01:24:13.247 --> 01:24:15.089]  It's an incredible thing.
[01:24:15.149 --> 01:24:16.170]  It's happening everywhere.
[01:24:16.751 --> 01:24:22.137]  I second you in encouraging people to go to pro-abortion demonstrations.
[01:24:22.178 --> 01:24:24.380]  In fact, just go to the March for Life.
[01:24:25.061 --> 01:24:26.823]  You'll find the protesters at the March for Life.
[01:24:27.103 --> 01:24:33.300]   In fact, when we were at the March for Life just recently in Canada, There was a guy at the back with a satanic flag.
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:34.961]  He was screaming, hail Satan.
[01:24:35.001 --> 01:24:36.182]  We asked him, why are you here?
[01:24:36.883 --> 01:24:37.663]  Because I'm a Satanist.
[01:24:37.703 --> 01:24:39.825]  So you're at the Proverbs March because you're a Satanist?
[01:24:39.905 --> 01:24:40.205]  Yes.
[01:24:41.006 --> 01:24:43.488]  We also talked to one of these handmaids women.
[01:24:44.488 --> 01:24:48.571]  It was 30, 32, 33 degrees Celsius.
[01:24:48.771 --> 01:24:50.613]  So in Fahrenheit, it's over 90.
[01:24:51.393 --> 01:24:53.455]  And we asked her, what are you doing here?
[01:24:53.855 --> 01:24:54.055]  What?
[01:24:54.456 --> 01:24:54.676]  What?
[01:24:55.216 --> 01:24:58.358]  You know, why are you doing this when it's so hot and yet you're doing this?
[01:24:59.039 --> 01:25:00.340]  She said, it's spiritual.
[01:25:01.537 --> 01:25:03.318]  So, it's very real.
[01:25:03.598 --> 01:25:04.879]  It's very out there.
[01:25:05.359 --> 01:25:06.959]  This is a satanic movement.
[01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:10.461]  The mask is coming down, and you're able to see it for yourself.
[01:25:10.921 --> 01:25:26.708]  And hopefully, a lot of that middle America that isn't really on either side, but they're generally what they call pro-choice, we want women to do what they do, finally can see, wait a minute, gee whiz, this is really the side of evil.
[01:25:27.448 --> 01:25:28.289]  And it's time to wake up.
[01:25:28.349 --> 01:25:29.049]  It's time to turn around.
[01:25:30.558 --> 01:25:38.021]  And really on the part of those who value life, those who value God, we have to understand this is on us.
[01:25:39.002 --> 01:25:40.022]  Remember what the scriptures say?
[01:25:41.263 --> 01:25:50.526]  If my people will turn from their wicked ways, if they will turn to me and heed my voice, I will bless their land.
[01:25:51.467 --> 01:26:00.751]   The whole land, the whole of the United States of America, the whole of the West will be blessed if Christians Turn to Christ.
[01:26:00.891 --> 01:26:10.196]  If Christians get on their knees, the only way we got to the overturning of Roe v. Wade in the Dobbs decision just now was because of prayer.
[01:26:11.256 --> 01:26:12.937]  Get your prayer pants on.
[01:26:13.518 --> 01:26:15.899]  Wear out those praying knees, as the song says.
[01:26:16.539 --> 01:26:18.100]  This is what we need in America.
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:19.921]  This is what we need in the whole of the world.
[01:26:20.442 --> 01:26:22.943]  And this is the path to victory.
[01:26:23.735 --> 01:26:25.476]  And Christ has already won that victory.
[01:26:25.916 --> 01:26:30.858]  It's just ours now to join Him in our own little sacrifices with His on the cross.
[01:26:31.919 --> 01:26:34.260]  And for that, we will be blessed in amazing ways.
[01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:36.481]  What do you expect them to do next?
[01:26:36.501 --> 01:26:37.461]  They're threatening violence.
[01:26:37.481 --> 01:26:38.542]  They're carrying out violence.
[01:26:38.562 --> 01:26:39.962]  They are just beside themselves.
[01:26:40.423 --> 01:26:41.963]  They're talking about packing the court.
[01:26:42.324 --> 01:26:43.584]  They're talking about impeaching the court.
[01:26:43.644 --> 01:26:44.985]  I mean, they are in a red rage.
[01:26:45.465 --> 01:26:46.786]  How do you see this affecting the election?
[01:26:47.126 --> 01:26:47.986]  I think it backfires.
[01:26:48.026 --> 01:26:49.887]  I think it energizes Christians and conservatives.
[01:26:50.167 --> 01:26:53.528]   And as you said, short story, Not name-dropping, it's where I was.
[01:26:53.989 --> 01:26:57.370]  He's a big Christian now, I've been a Christian a long time.
[01:26:57.610 --> 01:27:03.872]  But Jesse James, famous outlaw guy, and his wife, he's marrying a really nice lady, but with her own story passed.
[01:27:04.392 --> 01:27:09.974]  And a bunch of these friends were there, some of which I've known for years, because I've known Jesse for a long time.
[01:27:10.846 --> 01:27:15.086]   And they're all right-wing conservatives now. He's been a right-winger forever, but they're all right-wing
[01:27:15.086 --> 01:27:15.786]  conservatives now.
[01:27:15.786 --> 01:27:18.407]   They used to be super liberal women, and we're sitting around the table,
[01:27:18.407 --> 01:27:22.206]   they're like, "I used to be pro-abortion, like it was just a choice, and you know, it doesn't feel anything."
[01:27:22.206 --> 01:27:26.386]   They go, "Now I know it's about power and control, and it's a ritual, and it's evil."
[01:27:26.386 --> 01:27:32.016]   And all these liberal women who've been liberal are now super right-wing Christians without even having to go to
[01:27:32.016 --> 01:27:32.385]  church.
[01:27:32.488 --> 01:27:40.490]  Now of course, I went to church with Jesse as well and his wife yesterday, but the point is, is that they're being converted by seeing the evil of these minions.
[01:27:40.850 --> 01:27:47.252]  They're like, I don't want to be like that person, because they see how soulless and ugly and horrible they are, and it makes them scared.
[01:27:47.312 --> 01:27:48.552]  Gosh, I don't want to be one of those!
[01:27:50.513 --> 01:27:51.893]  You know what's truly amazing, Alex?
[01:27:53.014 --> 01:27:54.174]  Norma McCorvey.
[01:27:55.143 --> 01:28:07.165]  The Roe of Roe v. Wade was herself taken in by abortion supporters who basically sort of cajoled her into doing what she did.
[01:28:09.026 --> 01:28:10.646]  And she saw the light after.
[01:28:11.066 --> 01:28:12.326]  She had a conversion.
[01:28:12.826 --> 01:28:13.847]  She became a Christian.
[01:28:13.907 --> 01:28:16.667]  She fought for life for the rest of her life.
[01:28:17.827 --> 01:28:20.168]  And she was, of course, scarred by what happened to her.
[01:28:21.776 --> 01:28:31.718]  She worked with an organization called Silent No More, which is connected to Priests for Life, the great Father Frank Pavone and his great friend and co-worker Janet Morena.
[01:28:33.138 --> 01:28:36.238]  And they were with Norma as Norma was dying.
[01:28:37.899 --> 01:28:43.180]  And she begged them to continue the fight until Roe v. Wade was overturned.
[01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:55.517]   And I texted them on Friday, the both of them, Father Pavone and Janet Morena, and I said to them, You can tell Norma now, promise fulfilled.
[01:28:55.997 --> 01:28:56.357]  Beautiful.
[01:28:56.377 --> 01:28:56.737]  Stay there.
[01:28:56.757 --> 01:28:57.138]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:57.158 --> 01:28:58.098]  They promised that they would work.
[01:28:58.258 --> 01:28:59.738]  Let's repeat that when we come back.
[01:28:59.758 --> 01:29:05.400]  You know, respecting the will of the people is at the heart of our democracy.
[01:29:06.161 --> 01:29:08.461]  Even when we find those results hard to accept.
[01:29:08.661 --> 01:29:10.182]  You can run the best campaign.
[01:29:11.322 --> 01:29:12.763]  You can even become the nominee.
[01:29:14.164 --> 01:29:16.166]  And you could have the election stolen from you.
[01:29:16.246 --> 01:29:18.888]  Trump didn't actually win the election in 2016.
[01:29:19.349 --> 01:29:23.592]  He lost the election, and he was put in the office because of the Russians' interference.
[01:29:23.753 --> 01:29:25.794]  Trump knows he's an illegitimate president.
[01:29:25.814 --> 01:29:28.857]  The president, although legally elected, is not legitimate.
[01:29:28.917 --> 01:29:29.478]  I don't see this.
[01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:33.663]  President elect as a legitimate president.
[01:29:33.683 --> 01:29:38.186]  You said you believe that Russia's interference altered the outcome of the election.
[01:29:38.567 --> 01:29:38.887]  I do.
[01:29:39.027 --> 01:29:39.928]  I have an objection.
[01:29:40.168 --> 01:29:42.730]  I object to the 15 votes from the state of North Carolina.
[01:29:42.790 --> 01:29:44.772]  I object because people are horrified.
[01:29:44.892 --> 01:29:46.073]  He's an illegitimate president.
[01:29:46.093 --> 01:29:51.477]  What I believe is that there's no question that the outcome of this election was affected by the Russian interference.
[01:29:51.637 --> 01:29:54.219]  There absolutely is a cloud of illegitimacy.
[01:29:54.259 --> 01:29:55.800]  So that legitimacy is in question?
[01:29:55.820 --> 01:29:56.041]  Yes.
[01:29:56.201 --> 01:29:57.522]  So that was a very tainted election.
[01:29:58.142 --> 01:30:00.004]  And in that sense, it's illegitimate.
[01:30:00.064 --> 01:30:02.085]  He knows he's an illegitimate president.
[01:30:02.246 --> 01:30:03.827]  Actually, I think I carried Florida.
[01:30:04.027 --> 01:30:05.628]  Bush versus Gore.
[01:30:06.329 --> 01:30:09.912]  A court took away a presidency.
[01:30:09.972 --> 01:30:12.534]  We actually won the last presidential election, folks.
[01:30:12.554 --> 01:30:14.255]  They stole the last presidential election.
[01:30:15.191 --> 01:30:22.356]  I'm from Florida, where you and others participated in what I call the United States coup d'etat.
[01:30:22.436 --> 01:30:25.358]  There's no doubt in my mind that Al Gore was elected president.
[01:30:25.378 --> 01:30:29.600]  I rise to object to the fraudulent 25 Florida electoral votes.
[01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:33.483]  I must object because of the overwhelming evidence of official misconduct.
[01:30:34.901 --> 01:30:46.533]  It is signed by myself on behalf of my diverse constituents and the millions of Americans who have been disenfranchised by Florida's inaccurate vote count.
[01:30:46.553 --> 01:30:55.122]  By the time it was over, our candidate had won the popular vote and the only way they could win the election was to stop the voting in Florida.
[01:30:56.811 --> 01:31:03.811]   Bush, Jim Baker, and the Supreme Court hadn't tampered with the results, Al Gore would be
[01:31:03.811 --> 01:31:11.811]   president. The Supreme Court selected George W. Bush as the president. He was not elected.
[01:31:11.811 --> 01:31:17.811]   There is overwhelming evidence that George W. Bush did not win this election. What I
[01:31:17.811 --> 01:31:24.811]   observed as a voter, as a citizen of Illinois four years ago, were troubling evidence of
[01:31:24.811 --> 01:31:31.811]   the fact that not every vote was being counted. Constantly shifting vote tallies in Ohio.
[01:31:31.863 --> 01:31:41.267]  A malfunctioning electronic machines, which may not have paper receipts, have led to additional loss of confidence by the public.
[01:31:41.347 --> 01:31:44.269]  The right to vote has been stolen from qualified voters.
[01:31:44.429 --> 01:31:49.651]  The 2004 presidential election in Ohio was riddled with unnecessary problems.
[01:31:49.791 --> 01:31:52.953]  Some machines malfunctioned, causing votes to be counted more than once.
[01:31:53.633 --> 01:31:54.214]  Or not at all.
[01:31:54.394 --> 01:32:06.910]  Based upon an inordinate number of allegations suggesting gross voting rights violations and misconduct, I join with my colleagues in objecting to counting the state of Ohio's electoral votes.
[01:32:07.110 --> 01:32:11.136]  I agree with tens of millions of Americans who are very worried.
[01:32:11.596 --> 01:32:16.502]  There must be independent testing of the voting machines used in Ohio.
[01:32:16.322 --> 01:32:20.761]  There is no paper trail to record that vote.
[01:32:20.761 --> 01:32:24.201]   -There must be independent testing of the voting machines used in Ohio.
[01:32:24.201 --> 01:32:31.042]   -Without voter suppression, Stacey Abrams would be the governor of Georgia.
[01:32:31.029 --> 01:32:31.469]  We are!
[01:32:31.909 --> 01:32:35.231]  Andrew Gillum is the governor of Florida.
[01:32:35.391 --> 01:32:37.832]  If Stacey Abrams doesn't win in Georgia, they stole it.
[01:32:37.992 --> 01:32:38.472]  It's clear.
[01:32:38.792 --> 01:32:39.232]  It's clear.
[01:32:39.332 --> 01:32:42.074]  I think that Stacey Abrams' election is being stolen from her.
[01:32:42.574 --> 01:32:46.716]  I'll need an effective strategy to mobilize true international pressure.
[01:32:46.856 --> 01:32:48.156]  What kind of country are we going to be?
[01:32:48.737 --> 01:32:50.397]  Four more years of Georgia.
[01:32:50.898 --> 01:32:51.278]  Thank you!
[01:32:54.554 --> 01:32:58.376]  Watch the full video right now at BAM.video.
[01:33:02.498 --> 01:33:08.421]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:12.763 --> 01:33:17.806]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:19.344 --> 01:33:24.467]  As you can see and hear, he's a very eloquent, smart individual, and we should try to get him on more often.
[01:33:24.507 --> 01:33:26.068]  He's a busy guy, hard to get on.
[01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:28.910]  John Henry Weston, LifeSiteNews.com.
[01:33:29.090 --> 01:33:30.031]  And I want to just say this.
[01:33:30.511 --> 01:33:31.592]  He got caught off by the break.
[01:33:31.612 --> 01:33:35.814]  I want him to tell that story over again, because it was bringing tears to my eyes, and his as well.
[01:33:35.874 --> 01:33:41.518]  And I think it leads into my next question, and I want to really try to not be so excited and give him the floor to cover other key aspects.
[01:33:41.538 --> 01:33:45.020]  He's one of the leading experts in the world on the pro-life movement, and how it ties into everything.
[01:33:46.089 --> 01:33:48.684]  And this battle between good versus evil...
[01:33:49.707 --> 01:33:54.410]  But I think you were expanding on the fact that people have invested time, energy, their will.
[01:33:54.490 --> 01:33:56.891]  People have been sent to prison for peacefully protesting.
[01:33:57.372 --> 01:34:02.635]  This is a big win, but the real battle to win the war is now just starting.
[01:34:03.155 --> 01:34:09.639]  And if we just hold the line against all their venom and hate and violence, we're going to see a huge revival coming out of this.
[01:34:09.699 --> 01:34:12.201]  And you can already see it, so we've just got to hold the line.
[01:34:12.241 --> 01:34:15.883]  But please, finish your story, elaborate on that, and then other facets you'd like to get into.
[01:34:17.717 --> 01:34:45.252]   So the story really is of Norma McCorvey, the Roe of Roe v. Wade, who after she was used by abortion supporters to do this law in 1973, and just the horror of it, That affected her for the rest of her life, and she eventually was converted to be pro-life, then to be a Christian, and finally she worked as a Catholic with Priests for Life and also Silent No More.
[01:34:45.632 --> 01:34:56.000]  Silent No More, an organization of women who have themselves had abortions and speak out now for life, trying to get other women to avoid the damage that was caused them by abortion.
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:35:11.924]   And so Norma, as she was dying, She held the hand of Janet Morana, now the head of Silent No More, and she basically begged Father Frank Pavone and Janet Morana to
[01:35:12.626 --> 01:35:16.690]  See to it that the end of Roe v. Wade would happen.
[01:35:17.170 --> 01:35:25.338]  And I texted them on Friday to tell them that indeed, promised fulfilled is what you can tell Norma now as she's in the afterlife.
[01:35:25.719 --> 01:35:27.040]  That is powerful.
[01:35:28.181 --> 01:35:34.279]   Again, I've got a lot of questions here, John Henry, but What other areas should we be aware of?
[01:35:34.339 --> 01:35:35.399]  What should we be looking for?
[01:35:35.439 --> 01:35:36.699]  What's the next leg of the battle?
[01:35:37.159 --> 01:35:40.280]  Looks to me like they're going to push morning after pills and vending machines.
[01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:41.680]  I mean, they're saying that's their plan.
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:43.181]  Is that something big to be watching?
[01:35:44.661 --> 01:35:45.541]  Well, it is indeed.
[01:35:46.822 --> 01:35:52.063]  The fact of abortion being killing and child sacrifice is very real.
[01:35:52.523 --> 01:35:58.065]  So that when they do it, no matter how small the children are, it's still abortion.
[01:35:58.085 --> 01:35:59.145]  It's still killing babies.
[01:35:59.807 --> 01:36:02.709]  And the effect on the people's souls is also still there.
[01:36:03.670 --> 01:36:11.636]  So, whether they're doing it by a morning after pill or the abortion pill, the early abortion pill, whatever they're using, they're damaging.
[01:36:11.676 --> 01:36:22.704]  Now, in addition to the spiritual harm that it causes, the fact that you are engaging in murder and associating yourself with murder, there is also the physical health consequences to the mother.
[01:36:22.744 --> 01:36:24.365]  They take these drugs which are deadly.
[01:36:25.561 --> 01:36:35.829]  And then they don't get the proper medical care afterward, because very often, abortionists are concerned basically about getting the job done in terms of killing the baby.
[01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:42.415]  And as we've seen so many countless times, they don't really give a care about the woman after the fact.
[01:36:42.695 --> 01:36:44.977]  If she bleeds to death, oh well, that's on her.
[01:36:46.458 --> 01:36:47.379]  It's unbelievable.
[01:36:47.419 --> 01:36:50.601]  And who's there to pick up the pieces on the other side of abortion?
[01:36:51.122 --> 01:36:52.303]  The pro-life movement as well.
[01:36:52.947 --> 01:36:54.928]  So that's an incredible thing you can look at.
[01:36:54.968 --> 01:37:01.870]  But what is coming up is, yes, that pushing, but there's also the want to do it anyway.
[01:37:02.831 --> 01:37:14.835]  I believe it was Senator Warren is talking about getting Biden to make for some kind of area inside the states where abortion is now illegal to do it anyway.
[01:37:15.936 --> 01:37:21.418]  They're going to try anything by hook or by crook because, again, for them, this is like a sacrament, as you said.
[01:37:22.583 --> 01:37:33.551]  And they might be deluded with this is a women's right and so on, but what's coming out now with all of the violence and the extremity is many people will see it for what it really is.
[01:37:34.511 --> 01:37:36.793]  And God willing, we'll have more pushback.
[01:37:37.313 --> 01:37:40.816]  So we'll see this, this war fight out, and it will be a war.
[01:37:41.456 --> 01:37:49.934]   They've already shown That they will commit violence, not only violence against the children in the womb, they're firebombing churches and pregnancy centers.
[01:37:50.455 --> 01:38:04.943]  Jane's Revenge, that organization that's somehow publicly threatening people, talked about even how the next actions they take won't be as simple as cleaning up from a fire or some vandalism.
[01:38:05.464 --> 01:38:15.612]   So they're talking about real, actual, harmful violence that might Kill people, who knows what they're talking about, but this is very real.
[01:38:16.493 --> 01:38:18.334]  And so we have to be ready for that.
[01:38:19.255 --> 01:38:27.421]  On Faith and Reason, which was one of the shows that LifeSite puts out, we spoke of how churches and pregnancy centers need to protect themselves.
[01:38:28.382 --> 01:38:31.204]  Churches, for instance, need to develop security teams.
[01:38:31.965 --> 01:38:36.128]  We talked about how outside your church you might park a van, a security van outside.
[01:38:36.849 --> 01:38:38.290]  A lot of churches are already doing this.
[01:38:38.330 --> 01:38:45.933]  They're shutting down most entrances, having people only enter through the one entrance, so that ushers and your security team can be there.
[01:38:45.953 --> 01:38:47.053]  And you know what's really neat?
[01:38:48.173 --> 01:38:56.717]  You can involve all those young men, those young men between the ages of 19 and 25, who you very rarely see at church.
[01:38:56.737 --> 01:38:56.997]  You know what?
[01:38:57.017 --> 01:38:57.837]  They've got a job now.
[01:38:58.597 --> 01:39:04.287]   They can put all of those muscles and their bigness to the test by The church needs protection.
[01:39:04.787 --> 01:39:06.708]  Your parents, your grandparents need protection.
[01:39:07.168 --> 01:39:11.251]  Your little brothers and sisters or your nephews and nieces need protection.
[01:39:11.711 --> 01:39:14.793]  Come and stand there and protect the house of God.
[01:39:15.533 --> 01:39:22.877]  At the same time, they can hear the message of the Lord and they can come on side with the faith in Jesus Christ, which will lead them to embrace life.
[01:39:23.738 --> 01:39:26.219]  There's opportunity in all of this for us.
[01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:31.825]   So even though, yes, there's hard times coming, We need to pull up our bootstraps.
[01:39:31.865 --> 01:39:32.866]  We need to work really hard.
[01:39:33.346 --> 01:39:42.488]  We have an opportunity now to save lives and to work now in the state legislatures to get to the point where we can elect pro-life representatives.
[01:39:43.288 --> 01:39:53.071]  And that's why, as you keep saying, to make sure elections are fair and properly run is so key to what we're going to see in November.
[01:39:53.771 --> 01:39:54.691]  Expanding on that.
[01:39:55.717 --> 01:40:00.040]  I mean, you track all this at LifeSite News, but it doesn't make national news.
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:03.382]  But every day, Antifa is attacking a pregnancy center.
[01:40:03.863 --> 01:40:05.484]  Every day, they're attacking another church.
[01:40:05.944 --> 01:40:16.252]  And I see countless videos, even in D.C., of the left just randomly going to pick a Catholic church and go inside, start breaking stuff, screaming at people, and just doing all this psychotic stuff.
[01:40:16.812 --> 01:40:18.213]  I mean, they literally hate God.
[01:40:18.253 --> 01:40:19.094]  They hate churches.
[01:40:19.334 --> 01:40:20.515]  They see it as the enemy.
[01:40:21.315 --> 01:40:25.116]  And even in jurisdictions where abortion is still legal, they go attack the police!
[01:40:25.616 --> 01:40:30.957]  I mean, they're just frothing with hatred, and the things they say, the things they do, we can't even put on air.
[01:40:31.417 --> 01:40:40.479]  I mean, just, it's unspeakable that they think this is going to sell everyone on the practice of killing children when they are our best advertising against them.
[01:40:40.679 --> 01:40:48.342]   I know I keep going back to that, but that's what you predicted would happen, that's what the Bible tells us would happen, that's why we know It's an amazing thing, you know.
[01:40:48.162 --> 01:40:53.722]   come, we'll see the biggest revival ever on earth. So yeah, the Antichrist wins for a
[01:40:53.722 --> 01:40:58.001]   season but then that's actually the war that the devil loses.
[01:40:58.001 --> 01:41:05.001]   It's an amazing thing, you know. How is it that even when so many church leaders have
[01:41:05.001 --> 01:41:09.349]   really lost their way, They've basically gone into democratic camp.
[01:41:09.409 --> 01:41:12.772]  They hardly ever talk about abortion at all.
[01:41:12.812 --> 01:41:21.500]  They're, you know, they're trying to be on the uppity up with everything, not condemning LGBT anything, sometimes even participating in pride parades.
[01:41:21.761 --> 01:41:22.722]  Total insanity.
[01:41:23.663 --> 01:41:34.229]   And yet, the devil still sees the church as The enemy and therefore gets the people whom he has in his clutches to go and protest in.
[01:41:34.950 --> 01:41:36.531]  Why are they protesting in Catholic churches?
[01:41:37.092 --> 01:41:44.218]  Why are women basically going nudes with slogans of the need for abortion in Catholic churches?
[01:41:45.199 --> 01:41:45.799]  What are they doing?
[01:41:45.819 --> 01:41:52.064]  It's disturbing as heck for sure, but it's also demonstrating a couple things.
[01:41:52.325 --> 01:41:54.066]  One for all the mushy middle.
[01:41:55.367 --> 01:41:56.128]  Sheesh, those.
[01:41:57.409 --> 01:41:58.790]  This is what we're fighting for.
[01:41:58.810 --> 01:42:01.851]  This is the right to, you know, women's choice.
[01:42:02.432 --> 01:42:03.792]  This is really evil.
[01:42:05.113 --> 01:42:15.339]  And then also, it convinces the people that, wait a minute, this is satanic and we need to wake up.
[01:42:16.239 --> 01:42:18.220]  And I think that's part of the effort here.
[01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:23.683]  The need to wake up the whole middle ground so they can see this for what it is.
[01:42:24.283 --> 01:42:25.224]  And that's happening now.
[01:42:26.298 --> 01:42:28.582]  And the media, of course, is playing its game.
[01:42:28.642 --> 01:42:29.724]  It's unwilling to cover.
[01:42:30.565 --> 01:42:38.137]  As of already last week, we had over 23 crisis pregnancy centers firebombed and vandalized and destroyed.
[01:42:39.594 --> 01:42:42.076]  And there's more of that happening every single day.

[01:47:02.685 --> 01:47:06.769]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:47:07.088 --> 01:47:08.768]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:08.768 --> 01:47:26.768]   Last time John Henry was here with us, I told the story and I don't tell it because I'm
[01:47:26.768 --> 01:47:28.768]  proud of what I was involved in.
[01:47:28.942 --> 01:47:32.807]  I tell it because it's really a redemption story.
[01:47:33.408 --> 01:47:37.994]  I was brought up a Christian, and I had a relationship with God, but I was promiscuous as a teenager.
[01:47:38.995 --> 01:47:44.279]  And it felt very empty, and I was depressed over it, but I was still doing it.
[01:47:44.879 --> 01:47:53.285]  And my dad confronted me, and he said, I know you're out there getting girls pregnant and paying for abortions, because I got one of the girls over the house, and he talked to her.
[01:47:53.305 --> 01:47:53.805]  My mom did.
[01:47:55.046 --> 01:47:58.568]  And she was like 17 or 18, like I was.
[01:47:59.489 --> 01:48:01.210]  And my dad said, quit killing my grandkids.
[01:48:02.271 --> 01:48:07.584]   And he said, you're going to wreck your life and wreck You know, all these futures stopping.
[01:48:08.465 --> 01:48:14.066]  And I remember over the next year being convicted by that and then praying to God to forgive me.
[01:48:15.007 --> 01:48:18.288]  And it was like, it was lifted off of me.
[01:48:18.348 --> 01:48:23.669]  Not even some subconscious guilt that I wasn't a happy person because of what I was involved in.
[01:48:23.969 --> 01:48:25.090]  It doesn't mean I'm perfect today.
[01:48:25.410 --> 01:48:28.351]  The point is, I'm sure as hell not going out having abortions.
[01:48:30.621 --> 01:48:35.744]  But people, once they've had abortions, they harden their heart and they get more and more evil until they turn into these devils.
[01:48:35.804 --> 01:48:41.787]  And if I'd have told my dad, no, I'm not going to listen to you and kept doing that, I'd probably be a devil worshiper today.
[01:48:41.807 --> 01:48:43.467]  I mean, that's the path you're on.
[01:48:43.508 --> 01:48:44.388]  You've got to be on a path.
[01:48:44.408 --> 01:48:53.793]  And I'm telling people, you can break away from that path and you'll be so fulfilled and so empowered when you get on your knees and say, I repent, God, come into me, help me be good, put me on the right path.
[01:48:53.853 --> 01:48:54.673]  And it's a process.
[01:48:54.993 --> 01:48:58.015]  And then life is so much more fulfilling, so much more powerful.
[01:48:58.635 --> 01:49:03.597]  And these people are looking for power from Satan, but getting on your knees to Christ, that's what the real power is.
[01:49:03.617 --> 01:49:05.158]  And I wanted to get your view on that.
[01:49:05.178 --> 01:49:05.218]  No.
[01:49:06.598 --> 01:49:10.900]  Well, there's absolutely nothing truer than that.
[01:49:12.701 --> 01:49:18.103]  I, too, come from a very sinful past, involved in all sorts of very similar things.
[01:49:19.484 --> 01:49:27.747]  And what led me to this was, first of all, the recognition that this stuff is real, that the faith is real.
[01:49:28.419 --> 01:49:33.303]  In fact, it came out of the example of my dad, a daily mask, daily rosary, Catholic.
[01:49:34.203 --> 01:49:38.586]  But it wasn't just his example of doing that, of spending all his life praying.
[01:49:38.646 --> 01:49:46.832]  And gosh, I would come home from going to dance clubs at two in the morning, still be there praying at his bedside, sometimes falling asleep and kneeling, but sleeping on the bed.
[01:49:48.173 --> 01:49:53.517]  Really, what affected me even more than that was the persecution he received for being that way.
[01:49:54.429 --> 01:50:09.380]  His family members, myself and my siblings included, his own spouse, his family, his mom and his siblings, his colleagues at work, all calling him extreme or a freak or whatever for being so religious.
[01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:10.221]  And you know what?
[01:50:10.781 --> 01:50:12.743]  He did it anyway because he loved Christ.
[01:50:12.763 --> 01:50:14.424]  It was all about love.
[01:50:15.965 --> 01:50:22.030]  And you know that persecution he received for being faithful, that persecution he received for loving Christ above all else?
[01:50:23.041 --> 01:50:26.142]  was what told me it was real more than any words he could have said.
[01:50:27.062 --> 01:50:31.204]  And so I was able to embrace Christ myself, thanks to his example.
[01:50:32.444 --> 01:50:34.925]  And it gives you the greatest joy.
[01:50:35.685 --> 01:50:37.346]  It's an incredible thing.
[01:50:37.986 --> 01:50:44.508]  And it leads us to also recognize where the world is at and work for the world's redemption.
[01:50:44.548 --> 01:50:59.021]   Because all of these people, all of these people, even those on the other side, even the ones Performing the abortions are still children of God, and there's still a chance, until they die, to reach them.
[01:50:59.701 --> 01:51:03.163]  Perhaps we can't, but it doesn't stop us from trying.
[01:51:03.943 --> 01:51:09.106]  And so we don't hate the people who are on the other side.
[01:51:09.506 --> 01:51:10.307]  We actually love them.
[01:51:10.487 --> 01:51:10.787]  That's right.
[01:51:10.827 --> 01:51:12.448]  We try and reach out to them.
[01:51:12.828 --> 01:51:21.303]   And that's why such a big movement is in the pro-life movement to reach out to those on the other side, those committing the abortions, assisting it.
[01:51:21.824 --> 01:51:25.087]  Who is Abby Johnson, one of the greatest pro-life leaders that exists in the world today?
[01:51:25.607 --> 01:51:26.088]  Who was she?
[01:51:26.488 --> 01:51:38.719]  She headed up Planned Parenthood clinics and she knows the inside story and now she runs an organization which seeks to convert and has converted many, many abortion workers and it's so beautiful.
[01:51:39.745 --> 01:51:54.238]  Speaking to that, this Supreme Court is doing so many other great things, but the reason they're accelerating the censorship that's come out from some of the big tech leaks, as you know, is the gathering steam of the pro-life movement through free speech.
[01:51:54.358 --> 01:52:03.403]   And so, sure, they wanted to target Alex Jones and Donald Trump, but they're really going after The movement that is showing people, hey, these are really babies.
[01:52:04.304 --> 01:52:05.804]  This is really a satanic movement.
[01:52:06.345 --> 01:52:08.726]  And that's why this newest Supreme Court ruling is really good.
[01:52:09.087 --> 01:52:10.808]  A bunch more, they say, are going to come out in the next few days.
[01:52:11.328 --> 01:52:15.291]  Supreme Court says high school football coach can pray at the 50-yard line.
[01:52:15.691 --> 01:52:17.692]  Yes, we don't have a state-run religion.
[01:52:17.992 --> 01:52:19.553]  We have religious freedom in America.
[01:52:19.974 --> 01:52:23.776]  But I can hand out Christmas cards, or I can pray with people if they want to.
[01:52:24.116 --> 01:52:27.779]  Or I, as a valedictorian, I wasn't a valedictorian, but I could say a prayer.
[01:52:28.619 --> 01:52:33.061]  But even when I was a senior in high school, 30-something years ago, they told us, don't say any prayers.
[01:52:33.701 --> 01:52:41.365]  If you say anything at your graduation, and the football team, you can't pray in public.
[01:52:41.385 --> 01:52:42.925]  The coach can't pray at the huddle.
[01:52:43.425 --> 01:52:44.266]  That is tyranny.
[01:52:44.306 --> 01:52:45.786]  We individually can do whatever we want.
[01:52:45.846 --> 01:52:46.787]  That's the First Amendment.
[01:52:47.027 --> 01:52:48.648]  The First Amendment defends that.
[01:52:48.688 --> 01:52:50.669]  And finally, the Supreme Court said, stop it.
[01:52:50.729 --> 01:52:51.549]  That's another big victory.
[01:52:53.032 --> 01:53:06.796]  It is absolutely, because this is the thing, if we remove Christ from the public square, obviously people who should be able to see the good example Christians are giving, that's withdrawn from them.
[01:53:07.436 --> 01:53:08.256]  That's crazy!
[01:53:09.097 --> 01:53:17.439]  We see all of the Mother Teresas of this world, if she's never allowed to express her faith, people just think, oh, what a great, wonderful woman.
[01:53:18.519 --> 01:53:19.360]  That's not what she wanted.
[01:53:19.620 --> 01:53:21.502]  She didn't want to be known as a great, wonderful woman.
[01:53:22.142 --> 01:53:25.145]  She wanted to be known as the hands and feet of Jesus.
[01:53:25.405 --> 01:53:31.930]  We're here to serve you and to love you and to reach out to you and invite you into an eternal relationship with Jesus.
[01:53:32.391 --> 01:53:33.391]  That's what it's all about.
[01:53:33.772 --> 01:53:38.596]  And if we're forbidden from doing that, it so deprives the world.
[01:53:38.636 --> 01:53:41.038]  So this is an amazing Supreme Court victory.
[01:53:42.199 --> 01:53:43.600]  And all of this is coming.
[01:53:44.921 --> 01:53:48.564]  Two ahead, because the whole battle in life is all about this.
[01:53:48.744 --> 01:53:50.826]  It's actually all about eternal life.
[01:53:51.366 --> 01:53:57.391]  You know, we're here for, even if we're here for a hundred years, that is a blip on the screen compared to eternity.
[01:53:57.991 --> 01:54:02.695]  But in that blip, you're going to decide where you spend all of eternity.
[01:54:03.567 --> 01:54:08.891]  For millions and billions of years, in this shortest period of time, you've got to make that decision.
[01:54:09.271 --> 01:54:15.256]  And that's why the elites are all gathering to fight all the same agendas you mentioned before the break.
[01:54:15.756 --> 01:54:16.917]  How does all this work together?
[01:54:17.698 --> 01:54:18.058]  It does!
[01:54:18.658 --> 01:54:31.368]  Look, the same temptation that Satan always had, that he gave to Adam and Eve, to pride, to take power, to take the place of God, to be gods yourself, is given especially to the elites of this world.
[01:54:31.808 --> 01:54:32.789]  Take the power!
[01:54:33.735 --> 01:54:35.277]  And lord it over everyone.
[01:54:36.058 --> 01:54:36.879]  And what do they do?
[01:54:36.919 --> 01:54:44.888]  Well, they say, as you know, and you've said for over 20 years, the elites want to control the population of the world.
[01:54:44.908 --> 01:54:46.690]  They want to bring it down to, what, 500,000 or so.
[01:54:46.710 --> 01:54:47.731]  Excuse me, 500 million or so.
[01:54:47.751 --> 01:54:47.811]  Why?
[01:54:48.692 --> 01:54:49.073]  Why 500 million?
[01:54:49.093 --> 01:54:49.633]  Because it's controllable.
[01:54:54.051 --> 01:54:54.932]  And how do they get there?
[01:54:55.312 --> 01:54:56.973]  Well, population control.
[01:54:57.273 --> 01:54:58.874]  Well, how do we do population control?
[01:54:59.354 --> 01:55:00.415]  Well, contraception.
[01:55:00.855 --> 01:55:06.559]  And the first thing that did was it decoupled the link between sexuality and procreation, which is absolutely essential.
[01:55:06.779 --> 01:55:07.239]  Why?
[01:55:07.339 --> 01:55:09.681]  Sexuality was created for procreation.
[01:55:09.961 --> 01:55:10.581]  Then what did they do?
[01:55:10.641 --> 01:55:14.384]  They destabilized marriage because they know that's the building block of society.
[01:55:14.784 --> 01:55:17.486]  And that is what keeps families grounded.
[01:55:17.506 --> 01:55:18.946]  And they don't want children grounded.
[01:55:18.966 --> 01:55:21.568]  They want them subsidiaries of the state, not of parents.
[01:55:21.868 --> 01:55:22.769]  So they attack marriage.
[01:55:23.752 --> 01:55:29.694]  And then they attack life itself, both in early term and late term abortion.
[01:55:30.434 --> 01:55:32.215]  And so all of this works together.
[01:55:32.395 --> 01:55:36.977]  And of course, homosexuality is sexuality apart from procreation as well.
[01:55:37.677 --> 01:55:40.958]  And so... And now they've got the transgenderism to sterilize the children.
[01:55:41.278 --> 01:55:46.900]  It's all about decoupling us from God's order, making us basically domesticated corporate commodities.
[01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:49.181]  I mean, you can see the cold-bloodedness of this.
[01:55:50.521 --> 01:55:51.041]  Absolutely.
[01:55:51.181 --> 01:55:57.765]   And with COVID came A forwarding of this agenda, like, was very hard to see in the past.
[01:55:57.825 --> 01:56:05.272]  How could we fast forward this so fast to get us to a point where we'll all be subjected to a tyranny almost immediately?
[01:56:05.292 --> 01:56:06.393]  And it worked!
[01:56:07.205 --> 01:56:08.666]  They shut down churches.
[01:56:09.047 --> 01:56:10.488]  They made you stay in your home.
[01:56:10.809 --> 01:56:26.223]  They forced you to get an abortion tamed to jab under pain of losing your job, your livelihood, or being unable to see your parents dying in the hospital, and being unable to get treatment in a hospital for, you know, whatever disorder you may have, life-threatening, doesn't matter.
[01:56:26.964 --> 01:56:29.927]  You need to get this abortion tamed to jab, otherwise we're not going to treat you.
[01:56:30.868 --> 01:56:31.308]  And it was done.
[01:56:31.728 --> 01:56:32.209]  It all happened.
[01:56:33.137 --> 01:56:33.497]  That's right.
[01:56:33.517 --> 01:56:34.238]  We're out of time.
[01:56:34.298 --> 01:56:38.001]  I want to close this, John Henry West in LifeSiteNews.com, with this.
[01:56:38.882 --> 01:56:56.315]  Even the Daily Mail, even the London Telegraph, even the Associated Press, where I've run this video, scientists don't know why when the sperm makes it into the egg, there's an electrochemical explosion they can't even describe, because that's literally the new life, the new entity, with a spiritual connection to the higher dimensions of God, being activated.
[01:56:56.635 --> 01:56:58.237]  And scientists don't know why this happens.
[01:56:59.127 --> 01:57:03.910]  There it is, right there, an explosion of energy when those things come together.
[01:57:03.950 --> 01:57:04.950]  We are magic.
[01:57:05.030 --> 01:57:05.671]  God made us.
[01:57:05.991 --> 01:57:08.892]  We have a special destiny.
[01:57:08.993 --> 01:57:16.217]  And to deny that is to let these evil men that serve Satan become lords over us and pretend to be God when it's all a fraud.
[01:57:16.517 --> 01:57:17.137]  Thank you so much.
[01:57:17.157 --> 01:57:18.458]  Congratulations on your hard work.
