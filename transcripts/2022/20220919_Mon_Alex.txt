[00:00.000 --> 00:29.820]  Oh, oh, folks down in Louisiana, Mississippi like to eat their
[00:29.820 --> 00:34.480]  crawdads and their bullfrogs and the rest of it. And well,
[00:34.480 --> 00:38.160]  sometimes they just throw the whole frog in the boiling pot,
[00:38.160 --> 00:41.360]  but they learned that if we throw one into boiling water,
[00:41.360 --> 00:45.600]  he'll just jump right out. But if you set him in a cool pot
[00:45.600 --> 00:49.080]  of water, he just turned the heat up slow. He thinks it's a
[00:49.080 --> 00:52.440]  hot tub at first and then passes out and dies a painless
[00:52.440 --> 00:56.320]  death. And that's where America and the world is right now.
[00:56.320 --> 00:59.600]  We're in the middle of the New World Order. Great reset.
[00:59.600 --> 01:04.760]  Take down of civilization. Well, it's not driven forward by
[01:04.760 --> 01:14.520]  big kind decisions. The world is driven forward by small action
[01:14.520 --> 01:20.000]  but actions which are integrated into an overall system.
[01:20.000 --> 01:25.360]  This is a scientific technocracy takeover to force us onto
[01:25.360 --> 01:30.040]  the AI global social credit score cashless society system.
[01:30.240 --> 01:34.560]  If you're left behind, you're facing something far worse,
[01:34.800 --> 01:37.600]  which is to be completely irrelevant. They won't even need
[01:37.600 --> 01:42.160]  you as a surf or as a slave, adding to the body, a second
[01:42.160 --> 01:45.600]  immune system, which is not organic, but an inorganic
[01:45.600 --> 01:49.680]  immune system are made up of millions of tiny robot tiny
[01:49.680 --> 01:51.600]  nanorobots inside your body.
[01:51.600 --> 01:55.520]  What I learned from a source who is a very unique source having
[01:55.560 --> 02:00.720]  infiltrated the globalist cult at the UN level is that he was
[02:00.720 --> 02:03.240]  in high level meetings that required number of security
[02:03.240 --> 02:07.080]  clearances, where they actually discussed the plan to bring
[02:07.080 --> 02:10.800]  100 million people into the United States in order to pave the
[02:10.800 --> 02:15.280]  way for a regional government of US, Canada and Mexico. And that
[02:15.280 --> 02:18.520]  was to bring in 100 million people from Latin American
[02:18.520 --> 02:22.280]  countries together with a strategy of creating these
[02:22.280 --> 02:26.320]  cartels, making life unbearable. It's called a push pull strategy
[02:26.320 --> 02:29.480]  where they push all these people out of these countries where
[02:29.480 --> 02:33.120]  it's unbearable living like this, and they pull them into the
[02:33.120 --> 02:36.760]  United States. And then once you reach that critical number of
[02:36.760 --> 02:41.000]  over 100 million in this invasion, they will then propose
[02:41.000 --> 02:44.200]  that well for your family and friends back home who need you
[02:44.200 --> 02:46.880]  know, you need ease of travel, they need a better life and so
[02:46.880 --> 02:49.320]  on and so on. And we can do all this better with the regional
[02:49.320 --> 02:52.920]  government than we can with the US government. And they will
[02:52.920 --> 02:55.280]  have enough critical mass inside the country in order to
[02:55.280 --> 02:58.600]  effect that policy. That's that's the globalist plan that
[02:58.600 --> 02:59.520]  we're working towards.
[02:59.560 --> 03:03.240]  Now being aware of this is the key to winning and whether you're
[03:03.240 --> 03:06.240]  in Sweden, or whether you're in Italy, or whether you're in
[03:06.240 --> 03:09.360]  Canada, it's spreading all over the planet. So the globalists
[03:09.360 --> 03:13.240]  are in trouble. And this fight is literally in a tie position
[03:13.240 --> 03:16.640]  right now. If you think collapsing borders is bad, if you
[03:16.640 --> 03:20.040]  think all the terrible things in wars and police state political
[03:20.040 --> 03:23.720]  purges and censorship and cashless societies and gun
[03:23.720 --> 03:26.320]  purchases being tracked by the credit card companies illegally
[03:26.320 --> 03:31.240]  and putting you in a database. If you think that's bad, you
[03:31.240 --> 03:35.280]  ain't seen nothing yet. Last night, I talked about my
[03:35.280 --> 03:39.360]  involvement in the development of a little microchip implant.
[03:40.680 --> 03:45.640]  And many people have already taken that microchip implant.
[03:45.640 --> 03:50.040]  The news media has talked about it being a good thing. And they
[03:50.040 --> 03:53.800]  will tell you that it's a good thing to have this. Your
[03:53.800 --> 03:57.440]  children will ever get lost again. They won't be able to give
[03:57.440 --> 04:01.480]  you the wrong medication. You won't be able to lose this
[04:01.480 --> 04:06.680]  thing. And so the plan is underway that you will receive
[04:06.680 --> 04:11.480]  it. I would be remiss if I came to you and didn't tell you that
[04:11.480 --> 04:16.120]  God's word says, don't you take it? What matters for our
[04:16.120 --> 04:19.480]  children is we win this fight. What happens to us doesn't
[04:19.480 --> 04:24.280]  matter. And in that challenge, in that conflict, we will find
[04:24.280 --> 04:26.520]  the road to God.
[04:31.160 --> 04:35.560]  You've got to have the will to accept the truth and buck the
[04:35.560 --> 04:40.720]  system and the group collective through that. And you'll
[04:40.720 --> 04:44.880]  learn your way to the next level. This is the Info War.
[05:01.560 --> 05:04.280]  The best selling book in America last week was the Great
[05:04.280 --> 05:08.720]  Reset and the War for the Worlds written by Alex Jones.
[05:08.720 --> 05:12.880]  Jones sold more than 56,000 copies of his book last week,
[05:12.880 --> 05:14.720]  but the New York Times lied about that because the New
[05:14.720 --> 05:16.720]  York Times doesn't want you to know that. The New York Times
[05:16.720 --> 05:19.680]  wants you to believe that Alex Jones is more discredited than
[05:19.680 --> 05:22.960]  the New York Times. The paper that started the Iraq war by
[05:22.960 --> 05:25.120]  lying about weapons mass destruction and got a million
[05:25.120 --> 05:28.720]  people killed. So they lied about his book. The Great Reset
[05:28.720 --> 05:32.480]  and the War for the World. The historic book that lays out
[05:32.480 --> 05:37.200]  the plans of the Great Reset Death Star and exposes the New
[05:37.200 --> 05:42.880]  World Order's plans for global enslavement. Get your copy now
[05:42.880 --> 05:48.240]  at amazon.com to keep the book at number one and infowarstore.com

[05:52.800 --> 06:08.720]  for the World by Alex Jones. Now, number one in the world.
[06:08.720 --> 06:13.920]  Live from the Info Wars.com studios, you're listening to the
[06:13.920 --> 06:22.960]  Alex Jones show and now your host, Owen Troyer. And as always, an
[06:22.960 --> 06:27.520]  honor and pleasure to be here with you hosting the Alex Jones
[06:27.520 --> 06:32.320]  show on this Monday, September 19th, 2022. Now, we've got a
[06:32.320 --> 06:36.880]  loaded news day coming up as I'll be with you here through
[06:36.880 --> 06:42.400]  6 p.m. central fulfilling my normal war room host duties, but
[06:42.400 --> 06:45.920]  tons of news to get to here on the Jones show. Plus, we've got
[06:45.920 --> 06:51.680]  stuff from Alex lined up, including something that for
[06:51.680 --> 07:00.800]  me was, I don't really know what the analogy would be, but it
[07:00.800 --> 07:05.360]  was a relief. I think it was a sign of where the populist
[07:05.360 --> 07:12.720]  movement was going. And I think it shows that unity in the
[07:12.720 --> 07:16.240]  populism movement, in the pro-america movement, in the
[07:16.240 --> 07:19.440]  free speech movement, in the conservative movement, it
[07:19.440 --> 07:23.120]  encompasses all of that, this populist movement, that unity
[07:23.120 --> 07:27.440]  moving forward is going to be the key. And that doesn't mean we
[07:27.440 --> 07:30.800]  all have to sing and dance the exact same. That doesn't mean we
[07:30.800 --> 07:34.320]  all have to have the exact same vision for the future or how
[07:34.320 --> 07:39.680]  we're going to get there. But putting aside our differences,
[07:39.680 --> 07:45.680]  putting aside the division that the media wants us to remain
[07:45.680 --> 07:50.640]  in is going to be key. And I don't want to make a big issue
[07:50.640 --> 07:54.880]  of the past, but it's pretty well known that Alex Jones is
[07:54.880 --> 07:59.040]  considered a controversial figure. And people don't want to
[07:59.040 --> 08:01.840]  invite him onto their shows or they're afraid they're going
[08:01.840 --> 08:04.560]  to get censored, they're afraid the mainstream media is going
[08:04.560 --> 08:07.520]  to attack them if they share Alex Jones' videos. But what's
[08:07.520 --> 08:10.480]  happening? Kyrie Irving shares an Alex Jones video that goes
[08:10.480 --> 08:13.120]  totally viral. What does the media do? They attack him. They
[08:13.120 --> 08:16.720]  say how bad he is for doing it. That shouldn't be a sign for
[08:16.720 --> 08:19.200]  Kyrie Irving not to share an Alex Jones video. That should be
[08:19.200 --> 08:22.960]  a sign to share another Alex Jones video when the corrupt
[08:22.960 --> 08:25.840]  establishment is coming after you. So when I walked in the
[08:25.840 --> 08:29.360]  studio last night, because I knew we were going to play this
[08:29.360 --> 08:34.800]  video today, of Alex Jones getting a round of applause, a
[08:34.800 --> 08:40.480]  standing ovation at a Turning Point USA event. It was such a
[08:40.480 --> 08:47.440]  relief. It brought such a relief of a wave of relief because
[08:47.440 --> 08:52.240]  you can sit here and point out Alex Jones' flaws or you can
[08:52.240 --> 08:58.000]  sit here and point out Alex Jones' prophecy. But that man
[08:58.000 --> 09:02.240]  deserves to be speaking at an event called Defeating the
[09:02.240 --> 09:05.360]  Great Reset. He's been fighting the Great Reset for three
[09:05.360 --> 09:10.400]  decades. And finally, it's nice to see what we would normally
[09:10.400 --> 09:13.120]  consider the conservative establishment or conservative
[09:13.120 --> 09:18.160]  Inc. recognizing Alex Jones for calling out the Great Reset
[09:18.160 --> 09:22.320]  ahead of its arrival and talking about how to battle it
[09:22.320 --> 09:26.160]  and now it's gone into the hearts and minds of all Americans.
[09:26.160 --> 09:32.080]  So, here is Alex Jones at the Turning Point USA event. Just
[09:32.080 --> 09:35.520]  happened on Saturday. He's introduced to the crowd and we
[09:35.520 --> 09:38.640]  will play the full speech for you now here on the Alex Jones
[09:38.640 --> 09:42.960]  show. Since we're doing the remote guest, while I'm, while
[09:42.960 --> 09:46.000]  we're talking, I just want to make sure our guests can hear
[09:46.000 --> 09:48.720]  everything we're saying and all that. So, I was told by
[09:48.720 --> 09:52.480]  everybody, it's not the President Trump, but it is
[09:52.480 --> 09:56.960]  going to make you guys wait till you see this, all right?
[09:56.960 --> 10:00.240]  In fact, this man is more hated by the media than Donald
[10:00.240 --> 10:04.720]  Trump and that says something, okay? Which is, so if you're
[10:04.720 --> 10:07.840]  going to talk about the Great Reset, then you have to have
[10:07.840 --> 10:12.720]  someone who's the most banned man in America. Alex Jones
[10:12.720 --> 10:24.000]  joins us.
[10:24.000 --> 10:45.840]  So, Alex, whoa. Alex, welcome remotely. I was told by all
[10:45.840 --> 10:48.240]  the people like, oh, you can't have Alex at your event, which
[10:48.240 --> 10:53.600]  makes me just want to have Alex even more. Alex, you wrote a
[10:53.600 --> 10:56.320]  book on the Great Reset. What is the Great Reset? Why did
[10:56.320 --> 11:00.400]  you write the book? Well, I saw Steve Bannon yesterday and
[11:00.400 --> 11:02.640]  he's absolutely right and I, and I love the, you know, the
[11:02.640 --> 11:05.760]  title and the hashtag, Defeat the Great Reset. The Great
[11:05.760 --> 11:09.120]  Reset is what Ronald Reagan, when he was first running for
[11:09.120 --> 11:12.320]  office in 1979, spoke about. Nobody really talks about
[11:12.320 --> 11:14.560]  these, these speeches, but I mean, I've seen at least 10 of
[11:14.560 --> 11:17.440]  them, where he's talking about the New World Order and the,
[11:17.440 --> 11:20.080]  and the globalist and how multinational corporations,
[11:20.080 --> 11:24.160]  when he's a form of corporate communism, to control
[11:24.160 --> 11:28.560]  everybody. And so, I didn't discover all this. I grew up
[11:28.560 --> 11:32.640]  with my father in, in Dallas, where I grew up,
[11:32.640 --> 11:37.600]  taking me to see speeches by candidate and then President
[11:37.600 --> 11:41.280]  Ronald Reagan. And so, Ronald Reagan, the first few years of
[11:41.280 --> 11:43.920]  his administration, really got into this big central
[11:43.920 --> 11:46.080]  topic. There's not just communism worried about, not just
[11:46.080 --> 11:49.840]  China and Russia, not just radical Islam, but, but really
[11:49.840 --> 11:52.880]  powerful corporations that are authoritarian and want to
[11:52.880 --> 11:56.480]  take over our nation that are really anti free market. So,
[11:56.480 --> 12:02.160]  the Great Reset is the Bilderberg group, UN corporate
[12:02.160 --> 12:05.680]  arm. And a month ago, they were given official UN
[12:05.680 --> 12:10.160]  advisory, advisory status or on par with the Secretary
[12:10.160 --> 12:13.280]  General that the UN signed a treaty with the World Economic
[12:13.280 --> 12:16.800]  Forum in Klaus Schwab, who is announcing world
[12:16.800 --> 12:20.480]  government, announcing global IDs, announcing carbon taxes,
[12:20.480 --> 12:23.600]  announcing social credit scores, announcing carbon
[12:23.600 --> 12:26.240]  lockdowns, announcing everything. So, folks who really
[12:26.240 --> 12:29.120]  love the book, and it's been off and on, number one best
[12:29.120 --> 12:31.840]  seller for the last two weeks, and people ask, how'd you
[12:31.840 --> 12:34.480]  write this book? It's so powerful. This thing was about
[12:34.480 --> 12:37.760]  800 pages long, and then Tony Lyons, it's Sky Horse,
[12:37.760 --> 12:40.000]  his crew did a great job cutting it down to 300 pages.
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.000]  This thing could have been again a thousand pages long.
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.960]  It's mainly their quotes, bibliography, showing where
[12:44.960 --> 12:48.240]  they said it. People read this, and they say, is this
[12:48.240 --> 12:50.800]  believable? Then you go to the back, it shows the YouTube
[12:50.800 --> 12:53.920]  links, or the World Economic Forum links, where they are
[12:53.920 --> 12:59.840]  admitting it. So, Hitler, in the late 1920s, wrote Mein Kampf,
[12:59.840 --> 13:02.400]  or my struggle, which people will listen to, and we could
[13:02.400 --> 13:05.440]  have stopped him early. Well, Klaus Schwab has written a
[13:05.440 --> 13:07.680]  bunch of books that are basically his Mein Kampf,
[13:07.680 --> 13:11.600]  and this is a condensed breakdown of their own words
[13:11.600 --> 13:14.320]  and the blueprint of their global takeover plan, and how
[13:14.320 --> 13:16.960]  they plan to turn the world energy off, implode the
[13:16.960 --> 13:18.800]  third world, flood the first world, replace the
[13:18.800 --> 13:22.640]  migration. This is the Death Star plans, and so what's
[13:22.640 --> 13:26.880]  great is, I was talking about the great reset many, many
[13:26.880 --> 13:29.520]  years ago, and how they were going to trigger this big
[13:29.520 --> 13:32.880]  event to force us into a worldwide economic collapse,
[13:32.880 --> 13:35.680]  and a social credit score, and a universal basic income
[13:35.680 --> 13:38.240]  that controls every facet of our lives, which is not
[13:38.240 --> 13:40.240]  being rolled out. And people really didn't listen back
[13:40.240 --> 13:43.520]  then, but now they're listening because we're living in
[13:43.520 --> 13:46.080]  this operation, and so that's why the great reset in the
[13:46.080 --> 13:49.360]  world of the world is so important. We will beat them
[13:49.360 --> 13:52.240]  if mainline populist politics, which is the Republican
[13:52.240 --> 13:54.880]  Party now, we're taking over, thanks to you, Charlie, and
[13:54.880 --> 13:57.520]  that great crowd and so many others. Thanks to loyal
[13:57.520 --> 14:00.000]  Americans, we are winning this fight right now for the
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.160]  hearts and minds of the world. That's why the deep state,
[14:02.160 --> 14:04.480]  not just here, but around the world, is trying to silence
[14:04.480 --> 14:06.560]  people, trying to surveil people that just came out, as
[14:06.560 --> 14:10.480]  you know, yesterday, in federally released documents
[14:10.480 --> 14:13.840]  that not only is Facebook and other big tech companies
[14:13.840 --> 14:19.040]  taking direct orders from previously Obama, and then
[14:19.040 --> 14:22.080]  now under the Third Administration of Obama, Biden,
[14:22.080 --> 14:25.440]  but they are specifically spying on prominent
[14:25.440 --> 14:29.280]  conservatives' private texts and delivering without
[14:29.280 --> 14:33.280]  warrants, files on a minute-to-minute basis of
[14:33.280 --> 14:36.320]  everything we're saying and doing. And so it's far beyond
[14:36.320 --> 14:39.600]  censorship. It is total illegal criminal surveillance.
[14:39.600 --> 14:42.800]  They're going for a broke. And just last Thursday, in
[14:42.800 --> 14:45.280]  Senate hearings, the spokesperson, the corporate rep
[14:45.280 --> 14:48.960]  of Facebook admitted to all of this and just threw down
[14:48.960 --> 14:51.440]  the gauntlet. So the battle's joined, but I am
[14:51.440 --> 14:53.920]  extremely honored to literally be here with the
[14:53.920 --> 14:56.240]  leader of the PAC, Charlie Kirk, and the great
[14:56.240 --> 14:59.520]  Turning Point USA. I mean, your buzz has been giant
[14:59.520 --> 15:01.760]  for six years, and I'm telling you, everywhere there's
[15:01.760 --> 15:04.160]  victory, everywhere people are awakening, everywhere
[15:04.160 --> 15:06.400]  young people are being energized, and others. It's
[15:06.400 --> 15:08.160]  Charlie Kirk at Turning Point USA and what you're
[15:08.160 --> 15:10.480]  doing. So I am very honored to be here, and I salute
[15:10.480 --> 15:13.040]  you in the fight for Western civilization and the
[15:13.040 --> 15:15.440]  future of our world, and in the battle to defeat the
[15:15.440 --> 15:16.160]  great reset.
[15:22.160 --> 15:24.720]  So, Alex, in your book, you talk about the green
[15:24.720 --> 15:27.520]  agenda. We see rolling blackouts across Europe.
[15:27.520 --> 15:30.480]  Can you talk about the role that energy plays in the
[15:30.480 --> 15:32.480]  great reset? This is a topic we haven't touched on
[15:32.480 --> 15:35.680]  very much in our conference here. What does the green
[15:35.680 --> 15:38.480]  new deal, all this environmentalism, environmental
[15:38.480 --> 15:41.360]  fascism, have to do with the great reset? Can you help
[15:41.360 --> 15:43.040]  connect the dots for our audience here?
[15:44.480 --> 15:50.800]  If energy was a chess piece, if energy was a chess
[15:50.800 --> 15:54.960]  piece in the globalist game plan on the board, it's
[15:54.960 --> 15:57.440]  the queen. And for those that don't know about chess,
[15:57.440 --> 15:58.640]  the queen is the most powerful.
[15:59.440 --> 16:01.920]  People ask me all the time, what is your best
[16:01.920 --> 16:05.360]  new tropic? You've got turbo force, you've got brain force
[16:05.360 --> 16:08.880]  plus, and you've got brain force altering. Which one
[16:08.880 --> 16:12.960]  is better? And that's like asking, what's better,
[16:12.960 --> 16:19.280]  a Ford F-150, or a Cadillac, or a Ferrari. It's
[16:19.280 --> 16:22.480]  different strokes for different folks. It varies.
[16:22.480 --> 16:25.120]  All three are different formulas. All three do
[16:25.120 --> 16:28.400]  different things. Turbo force is 10 hours of clean,
[16:28.400 --> 16:31.760]  out of control energy. I can't even take a whole pack
[16:31.760 --> 16:35.760]  myself. Brain force plus is a long term acting
[16:35.760 --> 16:39.120]  clean, new tropic. This brain force ultra is a
[16:39.120 --> 16:43.840]  super fast acting, new tropic that creates incredible
[16:43.840 --> 16:46.480]  clarity, but doesn't last very long. They're all
[16:46.480 --> 16:49.040]  three different formulas. And finally, back in
[16:49.040 --> 16:51.920]  stock, massively discounted, brain force ultra is
[16:51.920 --> 16:56.000]  available at infowarstore.com. Brain force ultra
[16:56.000 --> 17:00.720]  back in stock, infowarstore.com. Everybody knows

[17:10.080 --> 17:13.920]  being promoted is the fact that it has natural
[17:14.960 --> 17:18.240]  psychotropic effects. It certainly does for me.
[17:18.240 --> 17:20.480]  When I take a couple of these capsules an hour before
[17:20.480 --> 17:24.800]  bed, my sleep, my dreams are amazing. Now there are
[17:24.800 --> 17:27.840]  actually some studies out there linking it to

[17:56.320 --> 17:57.760]  You're really going to miss out if you don't get it.
[17:59.360 --> 18:01.200]  Donald Trump and the mighty Republicans
[18:01.920 --> 18:04.880]  represented extremism that threatens the very
[18:04.880 --> 18:08.320]  foundations of our Republic. I wouldn't be surprised
[18:08.320 --> 18:11.120]  if this doesn't have an operational name. In fact,
[18:11.120 --> 18:15.840]  I bet it does. I bet it's called Operation Matador.
[18:15.840 --> 18:20.480]  They see us as the bull and they are shaky, a red flag
[18:20.480 --> 18:23.280]  in our face and the Matador is the deep state with
[18:23.280 --> 18:27.840]  a long skinny razor sharp sword so that when the bull
[18:27.840 --> 18:30.640]  lunges forward, the Matador uses the force of its
[18:30.640 --> 18:33.840]  weight to drive it into the heart and step aside
[18:33.840 --> 18:36.720]  with his cape as the bull varies himself into the
[18:36.720 --> 18:39.440]  dust. They've got the ace of spades in their hand,
[18:39.440 --> 18:42.240]  which is false flags. Before you launch a war,
[18:42.240 --> 18:44.480]  you stage false flags. That's the first thing you
[18:44.480 --> 18:47.200]  do because nobody wants to say they started a war.
[18:47.200 --> 18:50.560]  Bad guys start wars, so every time a war gets launched by
[18:50.560 --> 18:55.120]  bad guys, they stage an event. This is Operation Matador.
[19:01.680 --> 19:05.600]  Your voice counts. When you share information, be it
[19:05.600 --> 19:08.720]  over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[19:08.720 --> 19:11.360]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[19:11.360 --> 19:14.400]  They know you're angry and now to get around big tech,
[19:14.400 --> 19:18.240]  it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[20:17.280 --> 20:20.800]  We now go back to Alex Jones speaking at a Turning Point USA
[20:20.800 --> 20:25.680]  event this Saturday defeating the Great Reset. Here's Alex Jones on the issue of energy.
[20:27.680 --> 20:37.120]  If energy was a chess piece in the globalist game plan
[20:37.120 --> 20:40.640]  on the board, it's the queen. And for those that don't know about chess,
[20:40.640 --> 20:44.640]  the queen is the most powerful, powerful piece. She can go any direction she wants,
[20:44.640 --> 20:48.640]  do whatever she wants. So control of energy in their takeover plan
[20:48.640 --> 20:52.000]  isn't a pawn, it's not a rook, it's not a bishop,
[20:52.000 --> 20:55.280]  it's not a knight, it's not a king, it is the queen.
[20:55.280 --> 20:58.640]  And it is absolutely the most powerful piece and they admit that.
[20:58.640 --> 21:02.160]  If you control energy, you control populations, you can bring them to their
[21:02.160 --> 21:05.600]  knees and make them capitulate with a social credit score, universal
[21:05.600 --> 21:09.040]  basic income, everything they're doing. And so
[21:09.040 --> 21:12.080]  yesterday dissolving the borders and bringing in third-world populations is
[21:12.080 --> 21:14.560]  permanent underclass. Yes, they're attacking family
[21:14.560 --> 21:16.560]  values. Yes, they're funding our enemies.
[21:16.560 --> 21:20.400]  Yes, they're devaluing our currency. Yes, they are undermining our culture.
[21:20.400 --> 21:23.600]  And all those things are important, but the central piece
[21:23.600 --> 21:30.800]  is energy. And energy has two heads. Energy for electricity and cars and
[21:30.800 --> 21:35.360]  factories and society. So energy for machines.
[21:35.360 --> 21:40.960]  And then energy for humans. So we think as they cut off the pipelines
[21:40.960 --> 21:44.640]  and the keystone and won't let us have new drilling
[21:44.640 --> 21:48.080]  permits in the U.S., the Gulf of Mexico, or Alaska,
[21:48.080 --> 21:50.960]  all the great things Trump did within just four short years took us from the
[21:50.960 --> 21:55.040]  number three energy producer, the number one energy producer in a boom economy.
[21:55.040 --> 21:59.200]  By simple executive orders that Biden signed his second day in office,
[21:59.200 --> 22:04.320]  he turned off thousands of sub-pipelines, tens of thousands of pipeline spurs,
[22:04.320 --> 22:07.840]  killed more than 20,000 new pipeline spur
[22:07.840 --> 22:11.520]  permits. So even when they get the natural gas or oil, they can't get it
[22:11.520 --> 22:15.760]  to the central refining areas or to the trucks. Now that sounds important and
[22:15.760 --> 22:18.720]  we'll go more into actual energy for the internal combustion engine
[22:18.720 --> 22:22.400]  for power plants and things like that, but it's still not the most important
[22:22.400 --> 22:26.560]  head. It's the little head. The most important energy is for us,
[22:26.560 --> 22:30.720]  seven and a half billion of us, and it's called food. And their war on food is
[22:30.720 --> 22:34.800]  specific and direct in more than a hundred countries like Sri Lanka and the
[22:34.800 --> 22:37.200]  Netherlands. They're announcing the shutdown, Sri Lanka
[22:37.200 --> 22:40.080]  started three years ago, of almost all farming,
[22:40.080 --> 22:43.440]  any nitrogen-based fertilizer that's totally healthy and good.
[22:43.440 --> 22:46.000]  They've already announced within six years they're going to ban
[22:46.000 --> 22:49.680]  80% of cows this year, 30% in the Netherlands.
[22:49.680 --> 22:53.040]  That's why Klaus Schwab says you will have no beef, you'll own nothing, you'll
[22:53.040 --> 22:57.440]  like it, you're going to eat the bugs, is because they are literally
[22:57.440 --> 23:00.240]  listing not just carbon dioxide, a life-giving gas,
[23:00.240 --> 23:04.640]  the key fourth part of the carbon cycle, sunlight, water,
[23:04.640 --> 23:08.480]  oxygen, carbon dioxide, have to have it for life, but they're now targeting
[23:08.480 --> 23:12.800]  methane that bovine, burp, and also pass through the rear end.
[23:12.800 --> 23:17.520]  And so this is happening, this isn't coming, their revolution is now. A
[23:17.520 --> 23:21.360]  revolution against prosperity, a revolution against humans, a trans-humans
[23:21.360 --> 23:23.760]  agenda. And so we've got to point out that the
[23:23.760 --> 23:27.360]  mass starvation of the Third World, not from COVID-19, but from two
[23:27.360 --> 23:31.200]  plus years of IMF World Bank imposed lockdowns, whereas we had six months of
[23:31.200 --> 23:33.920]  lockdowns and whereas Australia had a year and a half,
[23:33.920 --> 23:37.200]  some parts of Africa and Latin America just went out of lockdown
[23:37.200 --> 23:40.720]  in the last six months. So they're collapsing, they've had national surveys,
[23:40.720 --> 23:45.120]  international surveys, 90% of the illegal alien migrants
[23:45.120 --> 23:48.400]  coming here, who I don't blame, some of them are criminals, we don't need to stop
[23:48.400 --> 23:52.080]  them, but 90% say, or 93%, depending on the
[23:52.080 --> 23:56.000]  poll, I'm starving. The farm I worked on is closed, or the
[23:56.000 --> 23:59.760]  factory I work at is closed, I have no food. And so they deliberately
[23:59.760 --> 24:03.200]  turn off the food, turn off the energy, the Third World collapses,
[24:03.200 --> 24:08.640]  then it floods us, the Western lifeboats, the First World Nations, we then sink,
[24:08.640 --> 24:12.720]  and the globalists organize after the great reset
[24:12.720 --> 24:16.320]  with their build back better, which is the authoritarian technocracy trans-
[24:16.320 --> 24:19.200]  humanist system they want to build on the rubble
[24:19.200 --> 24:22.480]  of our great Renaissance truly classical liberal
[24:22.480 --> 24:27.680]  civilization. And so everything is energy, energy for the combustion engine,
[24:27.680 --> 24:32.000]  energy for machines, and energy for humans, and they're coming directly
[24:32.000 --> 24:36.880]  at those two key sectors. So let's zero in on the food thing, Alex. In
[24:36.880 --> 24:40.560]  particular, they're fascinated with getting rid of meat.
[24:40.560 --> 24:44.080]  Talk more about that, but also talk about the other implications of getting rid
[24:44.080 --> 24:47.680]  of meat, testosterone levels, maybe replacing it with this synthetic
[24:47.680 --> 24:51.920]  nonsense that Bill Gates just happens to also be an investor in, by the way,
[24:51.920 --> 24:57.440]  super crony capitalist. Talk about why they're so incredibly focused
[24:57.440 --> 25:01.920]  on eradicating meat from our planet. What's going on with this?
[25:01.920 --> 25:04.480]  Well, if you go back to Genesis, anybody should go read it,
[25:04.480 --> 25:08.720]  written 3,000 plus years ago by amazing Jewish scribes,
[25:08.720 --> 25:12.560]  inspired by God. I mean, in the first chapter, they just keep talking about
[25:12.560 --> 25:16.000]  cows and meat all day long and saying that's the real symbol of freedom.
[25:16.000 --> 25:19.520]  Now Moses said later, we're not going to worship the golden calf, that's a
[25:19.520 --> 25:22.880]  doletree, but they were worshiping golden calf, they're worshiping a cow.
[25:22.880 --> 25:26.960]  And the cow is the perfect meat, the Native Americans knew it,
[25:26.960 --> 25:30.480]  everybody knew it. You can, you can make a bison with a water buffalo from Africa,
[25:30.480 --> 25:34.880]  India, or with a Holstein, you know, cow in France.
[25:34.880 --> 25:39.520]  So meat, red meat they've put out for 50 years is deadly and poisonous and
[25:39.520 --> 25:42.000]  horrible. There are now thousands of studies
[25:42.000 --> 25:45.520]  that it annihilates heart disease, it annihilates strokes.
[25:45.520 --> 25:49.200]  It's what our bodies are made of. We love red meat
[25:49.200 --> 25:52.320]  more than anything. What we don't need is highly cooked
[25:52.320 --> 25:56.160]  burned meat like bacon and things and things that turn into trans fats
[25:56.160 --> 25:58.960]  and artificial fats, gum up our arteries and our veins.
[25:58.960 --> 26:02.000]  When people just eat a plant diet, they have lower IQs
[26:02.000 --> 26:05.840]  for not as healthy when they don't eat meat as children, brain sizes and
[26:05.840 --> 26:09.680]  growth are up to a third smaller. So I don't really buy their official
[26:09.680 --> 26:13.920]  evolution line, but even the evolutionary scientists will tell you,
[26:13.920 --> 26:18.400]  humans they believe evolved, became powerful and smart, got big heads
[26:18.400 --> 26:21.520]  from eating lots of meat. It's as soon as humans heard of eating meat, even
[26:21.520 --> 26:24.560]  according to their theories, that we got advanced intelligences.
[26:24.560 --> 26:28.160]  So I mean, I mean, it's simple. You didn't have the ancient Vikings taking over
[26:28.160 --> 26:31.680]  the world, sitting there, you know, just eating their
[26:31.680 --> 26:36.560]  wheaties. Red meat is key. Fish is incredible,
[26:36.560 --> 26:40.080]  shrimp are incredible. Grilled is probably the best superfood on earth,
[26:40.080 --> 26:43.280]  but not everybody lives by the ocean. But there's a reason the longest-lived
[26:43.280 --> 26:45.760]  cultures, like the Japanese, mainly eat seafood.
[26:45.760 --> 26:49.600]  So in lieu of seafood, and most people can't afford it or get it,
[26:49.600 --> 26:52.560]  now I probably can't afford high-quality seafood every day, my god,
[26:52.560 --> 26:55.200]  the bills are incredible. But my wife thought each seafood last week was like
[26:55.200 --> 26:59.360]  $150. The point is, but beef is still cheap. And
[26:59.360 --> 27:02.320]  whether you're in India or whether you're in the Netherlands, where they worship
[27:02.320 --> 27:05.200]  cows again in India, sacred cow, because the milk or the cheese, everything it
[27:05.200 --> 27:08.800]  gives them, everywhere they have the cow, we have a
[27:08.800 --> 27:13.440]  ranch we've had, the Mexican land grants in 1826,
[27:13.440 --> 27:15.760]  and we still have the land, we still have cows on it.
[27:15.760 --> 27:20.080]  Well, without the property tax exemption or ad exemption,
[27:20.080 --> 27:22.960]  we couldn't pay for the couple thousand acres we still have left.
[27:22.960 --> 27:26.880]  And so most of these family farms also have cows.
[27:26.880 --> 27:30.160]  And so if you're not running a dairy or you're not running beef cattle,
[27:30.160 --> 27:34.480]  you have no money to even pay the limited reduced taxes you've got to pay.
[27:34.480 --> 27:37.360]  So if you undermine beef, anybody's put in an airplane
[27:37.360 --> 27:40.720]  or flown across country in a helicopter, I don't care if you're in New Mexico or
[27:40.720 --> 27:43.920]  New York or Texas, cows are everywhere. And it's
[27:43.920 --> 27:49.440]  cows that are sustainable, renewable, delicious, and nutritious.
[27:49.440 --> 27:53.520]  And so it's basically, if you want to starve people, the first thing you do is
[27:53.520 --> 27:58.320]  target beef, and then you undermine all the rest of the agricultural system.
[27:58.320 --> 28:02.720]  So Alex, that segues to a question that some people have,
[28:02.720 --> 28:08.160]  which is I want to just be as precise and factual with this as possible.
[28:08.160 --> 28:10.880]  Is there an agenda by the World Economic Forum,
[28:10.880 --> 28:15.280]  Klaus Schwab or Bill Gates, to depopulate the earth?
[28:15.280 --> 28:19.280]  What evidence do you have to show that and talk about the research you've done
[28:19.280 --> 28:24.400]  on that? I have so much evidence it gives me a headache.
[28:24.400 --> 28:28.880]  Anybody can see my seminal film that before Google took it off,
[28:28.880 --> 28:33.760]  had over 80 million views. I put it out in 2017,
[28:33.760 --> 28:39.040]  and it's called in-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[28:39.040 --> 28:42.320]  And people are always re-uploading it, it's free to air, there's no trademark,
[28:42.320 --> 28:45.520]  copyright on it, it belongs to you folks, that means use it.
[28:45.520 --> 28:49.920]  And it's a two and a half hour movie, and probably 30 minutes of it
[28:49.920 --> 28:53.440]  is just global leaders saying, we're going to take over the world, cut off the
[28:53.440 --> 28:55.440]  energy, shut down the easy parts. All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll have more
[28:55.440 --> 28:59.600]  from Alex Jones' speech on the other side of this break.
[29:00.480 --> 29:04.240]  Info wars work has never been having a bigger effect than it's having right
[29:04.240 --> 29:09.840]  now, and today is do or die time. If info wars gets the funding into
[29:09.840 --> 29:12.560]  the midterms in the next year, we're going to stay on air and be more
[29:12.560 --> 29:16.320]  effective than ever. But if we don't, I respect your decision
[29:16.320 --> 29:20.480]  and I'm ready to basically implode and shut down our main operations.
[29:20.480 --> 29:25.280]  I've done my work, I've put everything into it, I'm leaving it all on the field.
[29:25.280 --> 29:28.800]  But I believe at a gut level, you're going to come through,
[29:28.800 --> 29:31.920]  plus you're going to get great products that your family already need.
[29:31.920 --> 29:35.840]  So don't procrastinate, show info wars, you want to stay on the air.
[29:35.840 --> 29:39.680]  Go to infowarstore.com where we got three great products back in stock.
[29:39.680 --> 29:43.680]  Vitamin C and zinc, highest quality, super strong back in stock.
[29:43.680 --> 29:47.840]  Vitamin D3 and calcium, and of course, DNA force plus.
[29:47.840 --> 29:51.760]  All these products are 50% off together in a combo pack
[29:51.760 --> 29:54.960]  or 40% off individually. So the great products you already need for your
[29:54.960 --> 29:58.960]  immune system and we need the money to stay on air. So please take action now.
[29:58.960 --> 30:02.560]  Thank you. Ultimate fish oil is back in stock
[30:02.560 --> 30:06.000]  at infowarstore.com. What does ultimate mean?
[30:06.000 --> 30:10.480]  That's just our name for the best, the highest grade.
[30:10.480 --> 30:14.160]  What this concentrated and showy oil,
[30:14.160 --> 30:20.400]  pure arctic krill oil, and high quality wild caught salmon oil does for your brain,
[30:20.400 --> 30:25.280]  your heart, your cardiovascular system, and for your entire body's functions
[30:25.280 --> 30:29.840]  is insane. Regular low grade fish oil in all the studies
[30:29.840 --> 30:34.560]  does outstanding things. This is the highest grade and it's not been
[30:34.560 --> 30:39.520]  pasteurized, it's not been boiled, so it has its original effects intact.
[30:39.520 --> 30:44.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, everybody should visit infowarstore.com today and get
[30:44.320 --> 30:48.400]  ultimate fish oil finally back in stock for 50% off.
[30:48.400 --> 30:50.800]  For our regular fans, they're big supporters, you're gonna love it,
[30:50.800 --> 30:53.600]  you already know how great it is. But for folks who've been on the fence,
[30:53.600 --> 30:58.000]  experience ultimate fish oil for yourself. Try taking some before bedtime
[30:58.000 --> 31:02.800]  and see what happens with your dreams. It's the fourth coin that we've released
[31:02.800 --> 31:07.920]  the last year and I believe the most powerful, the man in the arena coin,
[31:07.920 --> 31:14.320]  Teddy Roosevelt. Medicine of a Republic, the man in the arena.
[31:14.320 --> 31:18.160]  There's only 10,000 of this coin and it exists in the world,
[31:18.160 --> 31:22.720]  it will never be made again. It's not just an amazing historic coin,
[31:22.720 --> 31:26.320]  it funds the information war against the globalist.
[31:26.320 --> 31:29.520]  This is something you want to hand down to your grandchildren, this is something
[31:29.520 --> 31:33.200]  you want to own. And as a fundraiser, it is
[31:33.200 --> 31:36.400]  funding the information war against the globalist.
[31:36.400 --> 31:40.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, 10,000 coins are available, they'll sell out very quickly.
[31:40.480 --> 31:44.000]  Please be part of history and thank you all for your support.
[31:44.000 --> 31:48.000]  You can go to 1776coin.com or you can go to
[31:48.000 --> 31:53.200]  patreoncollectibles.com and secure this coin. There's only 10,000 of this coin in
[31:53.200 --> 31:57.920]  existence and it funds the info war. Man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt,
[31:57.920 --> 32:04.000]  1776coin.com. Just look at these headlines from Reuters.
[32:04.000 --> 32:06.960]  World Faces on Precedented Global Hunger Crisis,
[32:06.960 --> 32:12.560]  UN Chiefs says going into 2023. World Food Program warns of global
[32:12.560 --> 32:16.160]  food catastrophe, looming global catastrophe. The world could run out of
[32:16.160 --> 32:21.040]  food by 2023. Major studies say and the reports go on and on.
[32:21.040 --> 32:24.560]  We told you this was a designed program by the globalist two and a half years ago.
[32:24.560 --> 32:27.600]  We told you energy and food prices would explode and now they're up more than
[32:27.600 --> 32:31.520]  40% of the U.S. alone. Some areas of the world are up over 100%.
[32:31.520 --> 32:34.560]  The only way you beat inflation and protect yourself and your family is with
[32:34.560 --> 32:38.720]  high quality, trouble food ready to ship right now at preparetoday.com

[32:57.760 --> 33:00.560]  yourself and your family while you still can.
[33:00.560 --> 33:05.040]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[33:05.040 --> 33:08.560]  it's Alex Jones.
[33:08.560 --> 33:27.920]  We're about to go back to Alex Jones speaking at the TP USA
[33:27.920 --> 33:35.120]  event defeating the Great Reset and it really is great to know that in this
[33:35.120 --> 33:39.280]  fight to defeat the Great Reset, to defeat global tyranny
[33:39.280 --> 33:44.400]  and the enslavement of mankind, that should Alex Jones and Info Wars be
[33:44.400 --> 33:48.080]  struck down like Obi-Wan Kenobi for everyone to
[33:48.080 --> 33:51.760]  see in this great battle, that there will be others left
[33:51.760 --> 33:56.240]  on the battlefield still fighting for freedom and truth and justice
[33:56.240 --> 33:58.960]  on this planet.
[33:59.520 --> 34:04.480]  We'd like to be in the arena forever. That's why we released the new coin,
[34:04.480 --> 34:09.520]  the man in the arena coin. You can go to 1776coin.com or infowarstore.com
[34:09.520 --> 34:14.240]  to get the latest installment. But it's just nice to know there's others
[34:14.240 --> 34:20.400]  on the battlefield and hopefully they will be ready for the trials
[34:20.400 --> 34:23.920]  that are ahead for this country. Hopefully they realize,
[34:23.920 --> 34:28.080]  as Alex Jones is talking about, the seriousness of the depopulation agenda,
[34:28.080 --> 34:31.200]  hopefully people realize just how serious it is
[34:31.200 --> 34:36.080]  and they girt themselves for this spiritual intellectual philosophical and
[34:36.080 --> 34:43.120]  in some ways physical battle that is ahead. So we go back now to Alex Jones
[34:43.120 --> 34:48.880]  defeating the Great Reset. I have so much evidence it gives me a headache.
[34:48.880 --> 34:53.360]  Anybody can see my seminal film that before Google took it off
[34:53.360 --> 34:58.240]  had over 80 million views. I put it out in 2017
[34:58.240 --> 35:03.520]  and it's called in-game blueprint for global enslavement
[35:03.520 --> 35:06.720]  and people are always re-uploading it. It's free to air. There's no trademark
[35:06.720 --> 35:10.000]  copyright on it. It belongs to you folks. That means use it.
[35:10.000 --> 35:14.400]  And it's a two and a half hour movie and probably 30 minutes of it
[35:14.400 --> 35:17.840]  is just global leaders saying we're going to take over the world, cut off the
[35:17.840 --> 35:22.000]  energy, shut down the family farms and starve people down to 500 million.
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.960]  The same thing was on the Georgia Guidestones. Incredibly ambitious,
[35:24.960 --> 35:30.080]  genocidal gold. And it is just replete and so is this book.
[35:30.080 --> 35:37.920]  Anybody can pull up Yuval Harari who is the high priest of this
[35:37.920 --> 35:41.600]  globalist group, the WEF, that is just the mouthpiece of the globalist.
[35:41.600 --> 35:45.440]  Anybody can pull up Klaus Schwab or anybody can type in World Economic
[35:45.440 --> 35:50.160]  Forum calls for depopulation. They are specific. King Charles III,
[35:50.160 --> 35:53.760]  he was Prince Charles, said he wants to depopulate the earth.
[35:53.760 --> 35:56.800]  His father said he wants to come back, Prince Philip,
[35:56.800 --> 36:04.640]  in Reuters and in AFP or the French news and also in the Autobahn Society said
[36:04.640 --> 36:10.560]  I want to come back as a virus to kill 80% of the world population.
[36:10.560 --> 36:16.480]  So Bill Gates' foundation, you can find these clips online until the late 90s,
[36:16.480 --> 36:19.040]  wasn't called Bill and Bill Gates Foundation. It was called the
[36:19.040 --> 36:24.240]  Depopulation Foundation. And so his father was the head of Planned Parenthood.
[36:24.240 --> 36:28.720]  So this has always been their agenda. This has always been their goal.
[36:28.720 --> 36:31.440]  They're not really bringing sustainable things to communities. I think we
[36:31.440 --> 36:34.320]  should industrialize the third world. I think we should have clean technologies.
[36:34.320 --> 36:37.040]  I think people should try to shoot for no more than three children.
[36:37.040 --> 36:41.280]  You want to have more, that's great. But we need, as all the scientists and
[36:41.280 --> 36:44.240]  demographers and historians and mathematicians and
[36:44.240 --> 36:51.280]  Elon Musk have said, if you don't have 2.2 children on average,
[36:51.280 --> 36:55.040]  every two adults don't have 2.2 children in the aggregate,
[36:55.040 --> 37:01.600]  you will have societal collapse. And so England has a 1.4, the US a 1.7,
[37:01.600 --> 37:06.800]  Italy a 1.2, Japan a 1.2. That is total collapse level.
[37:06.800 --> 37:10.400]  And then I'm sorry, nothing against third world populations, it doesn't work.
[37:10.400 --> 37:13.600]  You bring them in as the quote replacement group, all you've done is
[37:13.600 --> 37:17.600]  created a permanent third world population. You don't collapse the first world
[37:17.600 --> 37:21.600]  to save the first world. So the centerpiece of the globalist agenda,
[37:21.600 --> 37:25.520]  cutting off energy to machines and energy to homosapiens,
[37:25.520 --> 37:29.200]  is societal collapse. And then Claude Schwab talks about
[37:29.200 --> 37:32.960]  the angrier world. And as things fall apart, as things disintegrate and as
[37:32.960 --> 37:36.240]  crime explodes, they will then pose as the saviors
[37:36.240 --> 37:39.920]  with a global socialist communist government directed by
[37:39.920 --> 37:44.400]  crony capitalist fascists who are exempt from their own rules, just like
[37:44.400 --> 37:47.360]  Martha's Vineyard, you know, throughout the illegal aliens in
[37:47.360 --> 37:50.800]  24 hours, but tells Texas towns that have millions coming in,
[37:50.800 --> 37:53.200]  you just need to pay for them, you know, poor Texas towns.
[37:53.200 --> 37:57.120]  And so everything they say for us, it's different from them,
[37:57.120 --> 38:02.800]  and it really is just a very evil, corrupt, selfish worldview.
[38:02.800 --> 38:05.520]  And folks don't have to be rocket scientists to understand.
[38:05.520 --> 38:08.640]  If somebody's trying to cut off all the major farms in the world that aren't
[38:08.640 --> 38:12.160]  corporate-owned, if somebody's trying to make you eat and set it,
[38:12.160 --> 38:16.080]  synthetic gruel, if somebody's trying to make you drink sewage water
[38:16.080 --> 38:19.040]  and saying you'll own nothing, you'll have nothing, you'll be happy,
[38:19.040 --> 38:23.360]  if somebody's saying the age of humans being here is over,
[38:23.360 --> 38:26.640]  the post-human age is here, that's in the Wall Street Journal,
[38:26.640 --> 38:30.960]  that's in the New York Times. This is a sick, disconnected elite
[38:30.960 --> 38:35.600]  that disdain us and project their own hatred of themselves onto us
[38:35.600 --> 38:40.000]  who have appointed themselves as God, and they literally
[38:40.000 --> 38:43.680]  would make Hitler blush in how widespread
[38:43.680 --> 38:47.120]  and how wide-reaching their actual battle plan is.
[38:47.120 --> 38:50.240]  And what's insane, Charlie, is they're actually implementing it
[38:50.240 --> 38:54.000]  right now. We've left Beta in the New World Order, that's into 21,
[38:54.000 --> 38:57.280]  George Herbert Walker Bush, 1992, Rio de Janeiro,
[38:57.280 --> 39:00.800]  everything they called for by the year 2020, they did.
[39:00.800 --> 39:02.960]  They were a little bit behind, but almost got there.
[39:02.960 --> 39:06.080]  Now they're accelerating into 2030. So don't believe me,
[39:06.080 --> 39:08.960]  they get up and say, great reset, build back better,
[39:08.960 --> 39:13.920]  Agenda 2030, and go read the Agenda 2030 plan. It is biomedical tyranny,
[39:13.920 --> 39:18.720]  horse inoculations, carbon rations, food rations,
[39:18.720 --> 39:23.040]  carbon lockdowns, and they said last year, we don't care if you don't like carbon
[39:23.040 --> 39:26.080]  lockdowns, we're not going to have to actually tell you, you can't drive your
[39:26.080 --> 39:29.600]  car or you can't go to the store, you won't have the money
[39:29.600 --> 39:34.400]  for the energy. But who does have the energy is the third world in authoritarian
[39:34.400 --> 39:37.200]  countries, the globalist, these big corporations control,
[39:37.200 --> 39:40.080]  these crony capitalists, these middlemen that Trump talked about that are
[39:40.080 --> 39:43.200]  destroying the middle class worldwide, consolidate power.
[39:43.200 --> 39:46.960]  China builds new coal power plants every week, India builds them every few weeks,
[39:46.960 --> 39:51.200]  Mexico builds them every few weeks, but we've had over a thousand shut down here.
[39:51.200 --> 39:55.360]  They could build, again, hundreds and hundreds of new coal power plants,
[39:55.360 --> 39:58.880]  and it wouldn't pay for 30% of the electric cars.
[39:58.880 --> 40:01.680]  They claim they're going to pull the road. Scientists have broken down.
[40:01.680 --> 40:06.000]  There's not enough rare earth minerals in the world
[40:06.000 --> 40:10.560]  to actually make half the cars in the world by 2030
[40:10.560 --> 40:13.920]  go to battery driven, even though they're toxic and don't work, and
[40:13.920 --> 40:17.760]  most the energy that gets delivered to the batteries comes from a type of carbon.
[40:17.760 --> 40:20.960]  It's all a lie, they're telling us they're replacing
[40:20.960 --> 40:25.200]  the old quote dirty system with something new, but they are not replacing it,
[40:25.200 --> 40:28.640]  it isn't going to work, it's not designed to work, Spain a decade ago,
[40:28.640 --> 40:32.080]  was the first country to implement the windmills and all this crap,
[40:32.080 --> 40:36.640]  and they're in a sustained depression now.
[40:37.120 --> 40:40.160]  So I want to plug Alex's book here. We have it, The Great Reset. If you guys
[40:40.160 --> 40:44.240]  don't have a copy yet, you guys can get it. So Alex, I want you to dive a little
[40:44.240 --> 40:48.320]  bit deeper into part of what you mentioned, which is immigration.
[40:48.320 --> 40:52.320]  So what role does foreign policy also play in this?
[40:52.320 --> 40:56.640]  For example, it seems as if the Davos crowd was very much behind
[40:56.640 --> 41:00.560]  intervening in the Ukraine war, getting behind Zelensky.
[41:00.560 --> 41:03.840]  This can be confusing for some people. Can you talk about how
[41:03.840 --> 41:06.880]  what happened in Ukraine was almost a proxy conflict
[41:06.880 --> 41:09.840]  in some sense, and not saying that in any way shape or form
[41:09.840 --> 41:13.440]  we're not denouncing what Vladimir Putin did when he invaded Ukraine,
[41:13.440 --> 41:16.640]  but why is it that all of a sudden there was tens of billions of dollars being
[41:16.640 --> 41:20.000]  spent from the West, nearly 70 or 80 billion dollars to Ukraine?
[41:20.000 --> 41:23.120]  How does that fit in The Great Reset?
[41:23.120 --> 41:27.120]  Well, absolutely, Charlie. I've never been to Russia. I'm on a Russophile.
[41:27.120 --> 41:31.680]  I know that Vladimir Putin is not a sweetie pie.
[41:31.680 --> 41:36.720]  Neither is Xi Jinping. That said, China has announced control of the whole
[41:36.720 --> 41:41.760]  South China Sea and is actually spying on us and infiltrating us
[41:41.760 --> 41:45.760]  and shipping fentanyl in. If Russia was doing any of that, I would be
[41:45.760 --> 41:50.240]  absolutely in Russia's face. The truth is Russia is surrounded by the
[41:50.240 --> 41:54.240]  globalists in NATO. They overthrew the elected government eight years ago.
[41:54.240 --> 41:58.160]  I know guys that are my friends that have been over there the last eight years
[41:58.160 --> 42:02.400]  fighting and killing Russians in a proxy war with the U.S. in NATO,
[42:02.400 --> 42:06.480]  and now that's official. And so they kept pushing the Russian border.
[42:06.480 --> 42:10.400]  They kept killing Russians in Russian areas that have been Russian since
[42:10.400 --> 42:14.240]  Russia was founded. Russia was founded in Ukraine a thousand years ago.
[42:14.240 --> 42:18.000]  They basically translated Slav the Great. He was named Slav, so
[42:18.000 --> 42:21.920]  call himself Slavs. He was like an Orthodox Christian
[42:21.920 --> 42:27.120]  bishop. And so that's their birthplace. And so
[42:27.120 --> 42:33.040]  if Russia had troops in northern Mexico, I would be saying let's blow them up.
[42:33.040 --> 42:36.960]  I don't want war, but that would be provocation. This is a provocation. So you
[42:36.960 --> 42:40.720]  talk about foreign policy. Foreign policy and immigration is
[42:40.720 --> 42:44.160]  everything. You have the IMF and World Bank saying if
[42:44.160 --> 42:49.440]  you want these loans, you've got a knot in your lockdown.
[42:49.440 --> 42:52.960]  And then when the lockdowns go on and on, people start starving to death and then
[42:52.960 --> 42:59.840]  the UN builds giant migrant processing. We'll be right back with more folks.
[42:59.840 --> 43:03.280]  People ask me all the time, what is your best at troping?
[43:03.280 --> 43:06.720]  You've got turbo force. You've got brain force plus
[43:06.720 --> 43:10.480]  and you've got brain force ultra. Which one is better?
[43:10.480 --> 43:15.440]  And that's like asking what's better, a Ford F-150
[43:15.440 --> 43:21.040]  or a Cadillac or a Ferrari. It's different strokes for different
[43:21.040 --> 43:24.800]  folks. It varies. All three are different formulas.
[43:24.800 --> 43:29.440]  All three do different things. Turbo force is 10 hours of clean
[43:29.440 --> 43:33.200]  out of control energy. I can't even take a whole pack myself.
[43:33.200 --> 43:37.520]  Brain force plus is a long-term acting clean new trope.
[43:37.520 --> 43:41.440]  This brain force ultra is a super fast-acting
[43:41.440 --> 43:44.720]  new tropic that creates incredible clarity
[43:44.720 --> 43:48.160]  but doesn't last very long. They're all three different formulas.
[43:48.160 --> 43:52.880]  And finally, back at stock, massively discounted, brain force ultra is available
[43:52.880 --> 43:57.280]  at infowarstore.com. Brain force ultra back at stock

[44:00.160 --> 44:07.600]  Granny Do Right. Granny Do Right. Thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[44:07.600 --> 44:11.600]  Challenge. First of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny
[44:11.600 --> 44:15.200]  and for all the senior citizens out there that may have
[44:15.200 --> 44:18.960]  spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots
[44:18.960 --> 44:23.680]  or age spots as they're lovingly called. But since taking your X2 for the last
[44:23.680 --> 44:28.800]  couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually. People think I'm 55
[44:28.800 --> 44:32.400]  years old. And I was already taking your other
[44:32.400 --> 44:36.000]  supplements but I thought, you know, well maybe that's what I need to do
[44:36.000 --> 44:39.360]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation but when I started
[44:39.360 --> 44:43.200]  taking it, I mean it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period
[44:43.200 --> 44:47.520]  of time I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is
[44:47.520 --> 44:51.760]  working, this is wonderful, you know. I don't have to put on
[44:51.760 --> 44:56.080]  derma blend anymore, you know. So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it
[44:56.080 --> 45:01.280]  really has totally cleared up my skin. If you're like myself and so many other
[45:01.280 --> 45:04.800]  people on this planet, especially as you get older, you gain weight even if you
[45:04.800 --> 45:08.480]  eat a lot less. But I got to tell you, Info Wars is only
[45:08.480 --> 45:11.360]  about bringing you amazing products that really work.
[45:11.360 --> 45:14.640]  So we looked at the supplement market that we fund a lot of our operations with
[45:14.640 --> 45:18.560]  and we said, what are the best-selling natural,
[45:18.560 --> 45:22.080]  healthy, anti-fat weight loss products that are out there?
[45:22.080 --> 45:26.800]  We went and looked at the top 10 and they all had the same ingredients in common
[45:26.800 --> 45:30.400]  that is in this product. But with our new product from X7
[45:30.400 --> 45:34.640]  Diet Force, we got the very best concentrates
[45:34.640 --> 45:40.720]  of these known natural essences that's two amazing things for your body.
[45:40.720 --> 45:44.080]  And so I've lost almost 40 pounds, I'm so a little bit overweight,
[45:44.080 --> 45:47.520]  in the last three months and I've been doing it using Diet Force
[45:47.520 --> 45:52.160]  and also Exercise. Well now Diet Force is exclusively available right now
[45:52.160 --> 45:56.960]  at infowarstore.com, 40% off. Infowarstore.com,
[45:56.960 --> 46:00.080]  Diet Force, you need to take this product, it really works.
[46:00.080 --> 46:03.200]  Everybody knows that high quality fish oil
[46:03.200 --> 46:06.400]  does fantastic things for your cardiovascular system,
[46:06.400 --> 46:10.720]  for your brain, for every part of your body. But what I don't see being
[46:10.720 --> 46:17.840]  promoted is the fact that it has natural psychotropic effects. It certainly
[46:17.840 --> 46:20.560]  does for me. When I take a couple of these capsules an hour
[46:20.560 --> 46:25.760]  before bed, my sleep, my dreams are amazing. Now there are actually some
[46:25.760 --> 46:30.560]  studies out there linking it to amazing events in the brain,
[46:30.560 --> 46:34.960]  but I want you to experience it yourself. We know it's good for your heart,
[46:34.960 --> 46:37.920]  we know it's good for your brain, we know it's good for your arteries and veins
[46:37.920 --> 46:41.200]  and your lungs and every other function in your body, but

[46:57.520 --> 47:00.080]  out if you don't get it.
[47:00.080 --> 47:08.640]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:19.200 --> 47:24.960]  We now go back to Alex Jones speaking at defeat in the great recent event
[47:24.960 --> 47:31.360]  brought on by TPUSA. It was founded in Ukraine a thousand years ago,
[47:31.360 --> 47:35.040]  they basically translated the Slav, the great, he was named Slav, so
[47:35.040 --> 47:38.960]  call himself Slavs, he was like an Orthodox Christian
[47:38.960 --> 47:44.160]  bishop and so that's their birthplace and so
[47:44.160 --> 47:50.080]  if Russia had troops in northern Mexico, I would be saying let's blow them up.
[47:50.080 --> 47:54.000]  I don't want war, but that would be provocation. This is a provocation, so you
[47:54.000 --> 47:57.760]  talk about foreign policy, foreign policy and immigration is
[47:57.760 --> 48:01.120]  everything. You have the IMF and World Bank saying
[48:01.120 --> 48:04.960]  if you want these loans you've got to not
[48:04.960 --> 48:08.720]  in your lockdown and then when the lockdowns go on and on
[48:08.720 --> 48:12.080]  people start starving to death and then the UN builds giant
[48:12.080 --> 48:15.680]  migrant processing centers where they put them on boats, airplanes,
[48:15.680 --> 48:19.600]  and buses, in some cases they just walk
[48:19.600 --> 48:24.080]  across Central America, into Northern America, into
[48:24.080 --> 48:27.760]  Southern North America, Mexico, and into the U.S. and we see the numbers.
[48:27.760 --> 48:30.640]  I've talked to the bore patrol but down there many times just this year and last
[48:30.640 --> 48:34.160]  year, they estimate in Texas alone a month over a
[48:34.160 --> 48:37.360]  million people they're not catching. They'll get that straight and the bore
[48:37.360 --> 48:42.160]  patrol tell me 12 million a year since Biden's got in, so that's
[48:42.160 --> 48:46.480]  that's 18, 19 million people, so far through the Texas sector and when they
[48:46.480 --> 48:49.840]  do catch them they just send them on buses and dump
[48:49.840 --> 48:52.720]  them out wherever Democrats want and wherever they
[48:52.720 --> 48:57.440]  direct them around the country. So that is a direct effect of the globalist
[48:57.440 --> 49:01.840]  lockdown policy of the UN organizing those folks just like they brought in
[49:01.840 --> 49:06.080]  15 million Muslims in the last decade. The same guy
[49:06.080 --> 49:09.760]  that ran the refugee resettlement program into
[49:09.760 --> 49:13.600]  Macedonia, into Greece, into Italy, into France, into Germany,
[49:13.600 --> 49:19.680]  into Spain, the same guy came and got the contract last year in Texas
[49:19.680 --> 49:24.080]  with these giant, there's more than 15, giant migrant centers on the border
[49:24.080 --> 49:29.280]  that hold more than 20,000 people a piece, football field after football field
[49:29.280 --> 49:32.080]  after football field, of course they don't want that in Martha's Vineyard,
[49:32.080 --> 49:35.040]  they want it here, then they deploy those people,
[49:35.040 --> 49:38.160]  they get them a job, they make them pay part of the money back to Democratic
[49:38.160 --> 49:42.560]  Party front groups and foundations, and then they also
[49:42.560 --> 49:46.160]  put them on welfare and then make them give them, and these investigations have
[49:46.160 --> 49:49.280]  come out, about half their paycheck. So these are
[49:49.280 --> 49:52.880]  slaves, refugees of globalism, refugees of the great reset,
[49:52.880 --> 49:56.400]  refugees of the COVID lockdowns being brought into the US, brought into
[49:56.400 --> 49:58.800]  Europe, it's the same system in Europe, same system here,
[49:58.800 --> 50:01.840]  they're giving a cell phone and they're giving an ID system
[50:01.840 --> 50:07.200]  that is then skimmed just like NGOs skim off the homeless groups.
[50:07.200 --> 50:10.080]  That's why they promote the homelessness, ship the fentanyl in,
[50:10.080 --> 50:13.440]  give them all the drugs, tell the police don't stop them, is that so it's a
[50:13.440 --> 50:17.360]  lifestyle choice to go take fentanyl or sit around drinking all day
[50:17.360 --> 50:19.840]  or taking heroin or whatever the drug is they're on,
[50:19.840 --> 50:23.200]  because the left is siphoning off and skimming off
[50:23.200 --> 50:26.800]  the money off the top of that and farming illegal aliens,
[50:26.800 --> 50:31.040]  farming the child traffic slaves, farming the human traffic,
[50:31.040 --> 50:36.720]  farming the fentanyl hobos and drug addicts, this is the plan, now moving
[50:36.720 --> 50:40.160]  back to Ukraine, because that was your central question.
[50:40.160 --> 50:44.560]  We know now it's almost 70 million dollars since February,
[50:44.560 --> 50:47.920]  that's just six months folks that's been pumped
[50:47.920 --> 50:51.600]  into Ukraine and almost all of it gets siphoned back
[50:51.600 --> 50:55.920]  into Democrat party coffers and so we always hear about
[50:55.920 --> 50:59.040]  how money gets siphoned off to Israel and a lot of the aid money that goes to
[50:59.040 --> 51:02.720]  Israel does end up going back to US politicians, that's true, I'm pro-Israel
[51:02.720 --> 51:06.000]  but that's a bad thing, I don't like RNA because it's corrupt, it's like
[51:06.000 --> 51:09.200]  Rand Paul said and we also see that happening in other countries but
[51:09.200 --> 51:12.960]  if you compare the theft going on Ukraine
[51:12.960 --> 51:18.160]  never in US history has there been this level of almost 70 billion dollars
[51:18.160 --> 51:22.080]  as of a week ago, it was like 69 billion, I guess it was another billion, this was
[51:22.080 --> 51:26.160]  70 billion now, 70 billion dollars we know of
[51:26.160 --> 51:29.920]  black hole into Ukraine and then it comes right back out and then all these
[51:29.920 --> 51:33.520]  videos come out of US troops with Texas and
[51:33.520 --> 51:40.320]  Georgia and Floridian accents literally removing minds
[51:40.320 --> 51:44.240]  bringing troops in and slaughtering Russians, that is extremely
[51:44.240 --> 51:47.360]  dangerous and if we're going to go to war with Russia
[51:47.360 --> 51:52.480]  Biden should say we're in a proxy war, US troops are dying,
[51:52.480 --> 51:56.000]  this is going on, no no no, it was a big scandal
[51:56.000 --> 52:00.080]  when the general Russian public didn't know during the
[52:00.080 --> 52:04.080]  Afghan war, the 80s that tens of thousands of Russians died, they tried to
[52:04.080 --> 52:06.960]  suppress that, well this is going on here today,
[52:06.960 --> 52:11.600]  there are a lot of US troops being buried in
[52:11.600 --> 52:15.440]  very private ceremonies and their widows and widowers are being told don't talk
[52:15.440 --> 52:19.040]  about it, so we're in a war, a physical war
[52:19.040 --> 52:23.680]  with the Russians and again the Russians have got their problems,
[52:23.680 --> 52:26.880]  it's the culture of the Ukrainian opposition
[52:26.880 --> 52:30.320]  from World War II when Ukraine was occupied by the Nazis
[52:30.320 --> 52:34.000]  if you weren't a collaborator they killed you, so they adopted Nazism
[52:34.000 --> 52:38.560]  and then persecuted the Slavic majority. Now
[52:38.560 --> 52:43.200]  the Azog groups are the main people and they hail Hitler,
[52:43.200 --> 52:47.200]  they do the fascist salute and so all I'm saying is
[52:47.200 --> 52:51.840]  we are really in a lot of trouble here. So Alex, shifting gears here, you know
[52:51.840 --> 52:55.440]  the way that our own government talks about everybody in this room, they call
[52:55.440 --> 52:58.000]  them semi-fascists or domestic terrorists,
[52:58.000 --> 53:01.840]  it reminds me that back, you know, you were one of the few voices
[53:01.840 --> 53:06.160]  back in early 2000 that stood against the Patriot Act
[53:06.160 --> 53:09.520]  and I'll be the first one to admit I used to be in favor of all these silly
[53:09.520 --> 53:12.400]  programs and I think some people in this room probably were as well,
[53:12.400 --> 53:14.640]  you know Bush and everyone said everything's going to be fine, it's going
[53:14.640 --> 53:16.880]  to go after al-Qaeda, go after the terrorists,
[53:16.880 --> 53:20.560]  but you said hey this is going to be used against Americans and against actual
[53:20.560 --> 53:24.160]  patriots, going into 2008, 2009, 2010, Barack Obama
[53:24.160 --> 53:27.520]  played his hand a little bit, but Alex it's very clear that our national
[53:27.520 --> 53:31.040]  security apparatus spends more time infiltrating
[53:31.040 --> 53:34.800]  political dissident groups that they disagree with on the American right.
[53:34.800 --> 53:39.040]  Alex, talk about what you saw with the Patriot Act back in 2001-2002,
[53:39.040 --> 53:41.920]  talk about how people then take you seriously at the time but now it's a
[53:41.920 --> 53:44.800]  consensus view, then finally talk about how they're using
[53:44.800 --> 53:48.080]  Department of Justice FBI, all these national security apparatus
[53:48.080 --> 53:51.520]  as an arm of the Democrat Party. Absolutely, you know this is a great
[53:51.520 --> 53:54.960]  reset discussion but everything is a subset of that, so
[53:54.960 --> 54:00.560]  restrict the energy food and energy for machines, cut the energy up to humans and
[54:00.560 --> 54:04.240]  machines, but then let the authoritarian countries
[54:04.240 --> 54:07.120]  actually double and triple their profits like Russia is really doing,
[54:07.120 --> 54:11.600]  there's a larger global agenda above all this and it's the same thing
[54:11.600 --> 54:16.160]  for the national security state, nobody hates radical Islam and what I really
[54:16.160 --> 54:20.960]  call orthodox Islam more than me, nobody hates al-Qaeda and those dirtbags
[54:20.960 --> 54:23.200]  more than me, nobody's saying there isn't radical
[54:23.200 --> 54:27.840]  Islam in terror attacks and a terror threat, but you could look at how that
[54:27.840 --> 54:33.520]  legislation was written, what was put through in 2001-2002-2003
[54:33.520 --> 54:39.280]  and from day one it was being used against the American people
[54:39.280 --> 54:42.960]  because it was written saying this could happen to U.S. citizens,
[54:42.960 --> 54:46.080]  under military law and the laws of war, if somebody's a citizen
[54:46.080 --> 54:48.720]  and they're overseas or they're part of a terror group or they're here with a
[54:48.720 --> 54:52.640]  terror group domestically, nobody's held back from
[54:52.640 --> 54:57.680]  taking them out or going out, from that's just not true and so now
[54:57.680 --> 55:00.960]  the great reset is incredibly important and when I said the energy being cut off
[55:00.960 --> 55:04.800]  is central, that's central to their long-term goal, but in countries
[55:04.800 --> 55:07.920]  the globalists don't fully control like America,
[55:07.920 --> 55:10.880]  you can't have tyranny worldwide under the UN
[55:10.880 --> 55:15.440]  if you still have some free countries left and so
[55:15.440 --> 55:20.640]  folks the UN really is taking over, last Thursday Facebook again testified
[55:20.640 --> 55:24.960]  in the Senate that they take orders not only from the Biden White House
[55:24.960 --> 55:29.120]  on what the censor, they send them list of accounts every day
[55:29.120 --> 55:33.520]  and who to ban, but the UN also gives them orders, so we have this
[55:33.520 --> 55:37.920]  multinational international corporate front group the UN
[55:37.920 --> 55:44.640]  that has openly come out last June through the Biden administration, they
[55:44.640 --> 55:48.320]  put out their new counter-terrorism U.S. government policy report,
[55:48.320 --> 55:51.760]  nowhere was mentioned radical Islam, nowhere was mentioned MS-13,
[55:51.760 --> 55:54.960]  nowhere was mentioned human smuggling, nowhere was mentioned the Russians or
[55:54.960 --> 55:58.240]  the Chinese, and that's really exemplary to this as a communist Chinese,
[55:58.240 --> 56:01.680]  it was all people that not, that question elections,
[56:01.680 --> 56:05.280]  people that question lockdowns, open borders
[56:05.280 --> 56:10.080]  are forced inoculations and you can read the report for yourself
[56:10.080 --> 56:14.720]  and since then they've had all their talking heads and Obama and
[56:14.720 --> 56:18.240]  Hillary and Biden and Kamala Harris and all these senators and
[56:18.240 --> 56:21.280]  congressmen particularly the last month in a fever pitch
[56:21.280 --> 56:25.360]  ahead of the midterms 52 days out saying
[56:25.360 --> 56:29.280]  our opposition are terrorist, we have to kill the MAGA movement,
[56:29.280 --> 56:32.560]  we have to kill the Trump populist movement, these are quotes,
[56:32.560 --> 56:36.400]  we have to crush them, they're illegal and then now
[56:36.400 --> 56:39.840]  again we learn Facebook is spying on all prominent conservatives
[56:39.840 --> 56:42.800]  and sending your private messages that are nonviolent
[56:42.800 --> 56:49.120]  to the FBI that has special political units set up,
[56:49.120 --> 56:53.040]  a trillion times worse than anything Richard Nixon even imagined to do
[56:53.040 --> 56:59.280]  and so this is a political one-party system that is hated, that is corrupt,
[56:59.280 --> 57:02.720]  that is inside our trading, that is sold out to the chai comms,
[57:02.720 --> 57:06.240]  knowing the world's waking up, knowing America's waking up,
[57:06.240 --> 57:11.200]  trying to start wars as distractions imploding in borders as distractions
[57:11.200 --> 57:15.600]  and trying to then openly outlaw their political opposition
[57:15.600 --> 57:18.800]  and to create a uniparty one-party state so
[57:18.800 --> 57:22.080]  I am predicting and by exposing this they may not do it
[57:22.080 --> 57:26.000]  but I am predicting they're going to false flag or provocateur
[57:26.000 --> 57:30.640]  absolutely incredibly violent acts if not by the midterms
[57:30.640 --> 57:34.480]  as an October surprise, I mean the next few weeks
[57:34.480 --> 57:40.720]  but sometime before the 2024 election because they're telegrams
[57:40.720 --> 57:44.320]  all right ladies and gentlemen he keeps going
[57:44.320 --> 57:49.200]  the madman won't stop there's more on the other side of this break

[57:53.760 --> 57:58.320]  now and today is do or die time if info wars
[57:58.320 --> 58:00.720]  gets the funding into the midterms in the next year
[58:00.720 --> 58:04.400]  we're going to stay on air and be more effective than ever but if we don't

[58:11.440 --> 58:14.800]  work I've put everything into it I'm leaving it all in the field

[1:01:00.720 --> 1:01:05.440]  news and updates there and then as well on band.video where we actually have a
[1:01:05.440 --> 1:01:07.760]  team of legal experts that have a channel there
[1:01:07.760 --> 1:01:13.520]  covering that trial exclusively at band.video but
[1:01:13.520 --> 1:01:20.080]  you know people are starting to realize now as the censorship
[1:01:20.080 --> 1:01:23.840]  expands and ramps up and now the biden white house
[1:01:23.840 --> 1:01:28.640]  actually just demanding and running the big tech censorship demanding big tech
[1:01:28.640 --> 1:01:32.400]  platform censor their opposition and really running it at this point that's
[1:01:32.400 --> 1:01:35.600]  how aggressive it's gotten and of course info wars was target
[1:01:35.600 --> 1:01:41.600]  number one to be shut down and now they've moved on to their next
[1:01:41.600 --> 1:01:46.720]  plan of action which is if the censorship off the internet doesn't work
[1:01:46.720 --> 1:01:51.040]  then we'll go after you and destroy you in

[1:01:59.760 --> 1:02:03.680]  and so that's the process we're at now
[1:02:03.680 --> 1:02:09.360]  we don't have big billionaire donors big corporate donors we have you in the
[1:02:09.360 --> 1:02:11.920]  audience shopping at info wars store.com

[1:02:22.880 --> 1:02:26.640]  get taken out of orbit and grounded and not in

[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:48.400]  the new york times best sellers list is trying to snub us from being on it but
[1:02:48.400 --> 1:02:50.960]  we were the best seller the great reset in the war for
[1:02:50.960 --> 1:02:54.000]  world by alex jones you can get it at info wars store.com

[1:03:08.800 --> 1:03:12.240]  now if you're like me and a lot of people are like me
[1:03:12.240 --> 1:03:15.840]  when there's a changing of the season you start to get a little under the
[1:03:15.840 --> 1:03:18.560]  weather in fact if you listen to me often you probably notice
[1:03:18.560 --> 1:03:22.720]  my voice sounds a little uh a horse or raspy today
[1:03:22.720 --> 1:03:27.200]  got a little seasonal distress so i've been upping my supplement intake i feel
[1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:30.720]  great by the way it's just a little seasonal distress
[1:03:30.720 --> 1:03:34.480]  but that's because i take the supplements at info wars store.com if i
[1:03:34.480 --> 1:03:37.520]  wasn't taking all the supplements i probably would be in a lot worse place
[1:03:37.520 --> 1:03:41.200]  today uh with headaches and congestion and a sore
[1:03:41.200 --> 1:03:44.000]  throat and raspiness but really i just got a little
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:47.280]  just just like a one percent problem and i'll be fine
[1:03:47.280 --> 1:03:50.000]  and i truly believe that's because of the supplements i take an info wars

[1:03:54.400 --> 1:03:58.640]  combo which is a three supplement pack and we've been out of

[1:05:14.880 --> 1:05:18.560]  believe that Alex Jones is more discredited than the New York Times.

[1:05:53.120 --> 1:05:56.720]  Now number one in the world.
[1:06:02.480 --> 1:06:08.240]  Older talking heads and Obama and Hillary and Biden and Kamala Harris and
[1:06:08.240 --> 1:06:11.840]  all these senators and congressmen particularly the last month in a fever
[1:06:11.840 --> 1:06:17.120]  pitch out of the midterms 52 days out saying our opposition are
[1:06:17.120 --> 1:06:21.440]  terrorist. We have to kill the MAGA movement. We have to kill the Trump
[1:06:21.440 --> 1:06:24.880]  populist movement. These are quotes. We have to crush them.
[1:06:24.880 --> 1:06:29.360]  They're illegal and then now again we learn Facebook is spying on all
[1:06:29.360 --> 1:06:33.600]  prominent conservatives and sending your private messages that are nonviolent
[1:06:33.600 --> 1:06:39.920]  to the FBI that has special political units set up
[1:06:39.920 --> 1:06:43.840]  a trillion times worse than anything Richard Nixon even imagined to do
[1:06:43.840 --> 1:06:50.080]  and so this is a political one-party system that is hated that is corrupt
[1:06:50.080 --> 1:06:53.440]  that is inside our trading that is sold out to the chai comms
[1:06:53.440 --> 1:06:57.040]  knowing the world's waking up knowing America's waking up
[1:06:57.040 --> 1:07:02.000]  trying to start wars as distractions imploding in borders as distractions
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:06.400]  and trying to then openly outlaw their political opposition
[1:07:06.400 --> 1:07:09.600]  and to create a uniparty one-party state so
[1:07:09.600 --> 1:07:12.880]  I am predicting and by exposing this they may not do it
[1:07:12.880 --> 1:07:16.800]  but I am predicting they're going to false flag or provocateur
[1:07:16.800 --> 1:07:21.440]  absolutely incredibly violent acts if not by the midterms
[1:07:21.440 --> 1:07:25.360]  as an october surprise I mean the next few weeks
[1:07:25.360 --> 1:07:32.240]  but sometime before the 2024 election because they're telegraphing it
[1:07:32.240 --> 1:07:35.680]  they're saying republicans are terrorists no we didn't burn down
[1:07:35.680 --> 1:07:39.760]  2.3 billion dollars of car dealerships and
[1:07:39.760 --> 1:07:43.600]  and and and people's apartment homes and we didn't shoot a bunch of cops and
[1:07:43.600 --> 1:07:46.800]  shoot a bunch of innocent people mostly peaceful demonstrators
[1:07:46.800 --> 1:07:50.640]  so we're being branded as loyal hard-working good americans
[1:07:50.640 --> 1:07:55.280]  as terrorists the leftist media saying white people inherently are bad and
[1:07:55.280 --> 1:07:59.680]  evil they plan on trying to trigger a race war
[1:07:59.680 --> 1:08:03.200]  and a political war and I know conservatives and populists and
[1:08:03.200 --> 1:08:06.400]  nationalist and america firsters don't want that aren't stupid
[1:08:06.400 --> 1:08:09.440]  we don't think it cops our enemy or an average FBI agent
[1:08:09.440 --> 1:08:12.400]  we don't think car bombing a federal bill that's good it's bad
[1:08:12.400 --> 1:08:16.960]  so we have no motive we wouldn't do it but who has a motive and who is
[1:08:16.960 --> 1:08:20.960]  swinging from the chandeliers running around like chickens with their heads
[1:08:20.960 --> 1:08:23.920]  cut off saying we're about to blow stuff up or shoot
[1:08:23.920 --> 1:08:27.680]  people that is them telling you what their desperate
[1:08:27.680 --> 1:08:32.000]  next move their primal scream that steve bannon talked about
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:35.440]  that's what their backs against the wall their cornered rats
[1:08:35.440 --> 1:08:38.720]  we're winning ideologically culturally economically spiritually
[1:08:38.720 --> 1:08:42.000]  the whole world's turning against globalism they're electing to leadership
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:45.520]  positions all over eastern europe and in canada and australia
[1:08:45.520 --> 1:08:48.720]  and latin america populist anti-globalist
[1:08:48.720 --> 1:08:52.000]  nationalist christian patriots so they see the trend
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:56.480]  and their answer is outlaw their political opposition by staging terror
[1:08:56.480 --> 1:08:59.680]  attacks and blaming it on us and that's what takes us back
[1:08:59.680 --> 1:09:04.320]  to 2002 2003 of this whole process so i want to i want to re-emphasize that
[1:09:04.320 --> 1:09:06.400]  alex just said i wrote a whole piece for the great
[1:09:06.400 --> 1:09:09.840]  website revolver.news i know a lot of you guys read revolver.news
[1:09:09.840 --> 1:09:14.400]  they do a fabulous job which is you cannot allow them to provoke you into
[1:09:14.400 --> 1:09:17.760]  doing something that you do not want to do that you would regret we have to
[1:09:17.760 --> 1:09:21.920]  stay peaceful they would love nothing more than to try to provoke the entire
[1:09:21.920 --> 1:09:24.480]  maga movement like what remember james lindsay said
[1:09:24.480 --> 1:09:27.440]  go right up to the inch before your face and you slap it away
[1:09:27.440 --> 1:09:31.120]  it's very very important and alex articulated how they might try to
[1:09:31.120 --> 1:09:34.160]  infiltrate groups they might try to infiltrate chat rooms
[1:09:34.160 --> 1:09:38.960]  they and this is we know this thanks to declassified fbi documents and doj
[1:09:38.960 --> 1:09:41.760]  documents and they're they're almost warning in advance
[1:09:41.760 --> 1:09:44.160]  and alex i said the same thing on our podcast
[1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:47.360]  which is why they all of a sudden out of anywhere say well these people support
[1:09:47.360 --> 1:09:51.280]  political violence domestic violent extremism it's very strange how it's
[1:09:51.280 --> 1:09:54.720]  almost this drumbeat has come out of nowhere they have to get that narrative
[1:09:54.720 --> 1:09:58.960]  in the zeitgeist so i just want to re-emphasize everyone watching at home
[1:09:58.960 --> 1:10:05.440]  we remain peaceful they lose in fact it's very important okay
[1:10:06.800 --> 1:10:09.520]  two weeks ago i did three hours on this
[1:10:09.520 --> 1:10:13.280]  literally screaming it took to my millions of listeners and viewers
[1:10:13.280 --> 1:10:18.000]  and it was a telltale sign cnn msnbc the young turks
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:20.880]  and there was more than that i couldn't watch it all
[1:10:20.880 --> 1:10:25.120]  dozens of programs said alex jones calls for political violence
[1:10:25.120 --> 1:10:27.920]  and then they would show video of me without audio
[1:10:27.920 --> 1:10:32.800]  but never say what i said so they were so upset by me saying don't be violent
[1:10:32.800 --> 1:10:35.680]  that they put out national reports saying i called for violence
[1:10:35.680 --> 1:10:41.440]  these people are bottomless they are willing to go to any length and i'm
[1:10:41.440 --> 1:10:44.160]  telling you folks i used to think that i knew how bad they were
[1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:48.320]  now that i've experienced this at the level trumps experienced it
[1:10:48.320 --> 1:10:54.080]  they will create whole systems of lies where the story is so elaborate so big
[1:10:54.080 --> 1:10:57.040]  so crazy you think well some of that's gotta be true
[1:10:57.040 --> 1:10:59.360]  no they've created stories about me i'm not being a victim
[1:10:59.360 --> 1:11:02.080]  the viewers need to know and the audience needs to know
[1:11:02.080 --> 1:11:05.760]  folks i'm telling you they create stories about me where none of it's true
[1:11:05.760 --> 1:11:09.520]  and they're whole complex narratives whole complex things
[1:11:09.520 --> 1:11:13.920]  and i'm like reading this or watching this and i mean you know hour-long cnn
[1:11:13.920 --> 1:11:18.160]  specials hbo specials pbs specials and i'm watching it and
[1:11:18.160 --> 1:11:22.720]  none of it is true none of it normally you think you know they mix a lie in
[1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:26.160]  you know slip the poison in with a piece of candy no no no
[1:11:26.160 --> 1:11:29.840]  they have gone to the next level we all wonder well everybody hates the mainstream
[1:11:29.840 --> 1:11:32.160]  media people are waking up they're turning against them
[1:11:32.160 --> 1:11:34.720]  what will they do will they will they stop lying
[1:11:34.720 --> 1:11:38.640]  and the answer is no this new cnn ownership they're not backing off
[1:11:38.640 --> 1:11:42.960]  they're just getting less obvious about it
[1:11:42.960 --> 1:11:46.400]  it's um it's very clear it's a whole system of lies that's well said for
[1:11:46.400 --> 1:11:48.960]  those of you watching at home i'll just mention again we have a turning point
[1:11:48.960 --> 1:11:52.960]  usa booklet for any and gift of any amount of turning point usa tpusa.com
[1:11:52.960 --> 1:11:56.480]  you guys can get this and i want to secondly also plug alex jones book the
[1:11:56.480 --> 1:12:01.040]  great reset it's fabulous for everyone watching at home
[1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:05.120]  so alex we have a couple minutes remaining here i want to go through two
[1:12:05.120 --> 1:12:09.760]  remaining topics number one transhumanism merging of man and machine
[1:12:09.760 --> 1:12:12.880]  the media hates when you talk about it and then finally i want to finish with
[1:12:12.880 --> 1:12:16.160]  the last question of what can we do because i'm looking at the audience
[1:12:16.160 --> 1:12:18.480]  here and you're talking about this alex i could just feel
[1:12:18.480 --> 1:12:23.920]  the kind of vibe of it's overwhelming and so alex start with transhumanism
[1:12:23.920 --> 1:12:27.120]  just do that really quick and then tell the people tell the audience tell the
[1:12:27.120 --> 1:12:29.520]  millions at home tell the grassroots tell the citizens
[1:12:29.520 --> 1:12:33.120]  what can be done to defeat the great reset
[1:12:33.120 --> 1:12:36.960]  beautifully said charlie thank you so much sir look they're cutting off our
[1:12:36.960 --> 1:12:39.440]  energy they're they're coming after our freedoms are
[1:12:39.440 --> 1:12:42.960]  imploding our future but once we wake up they're the
[1:12:42.960 --> 1:12:45.840]  ones doing it on purpose and they can't pose as a savior
[1:12:45.840 --> 1:12:50.240]  and once their great reset is known it's game over so their plan for us
[1:12:50.240 --> 1:12:53.920]  is poverty and implosion you'll own nothing you'll have nothing
[1:12:53.920 --> 1:12:57.360]  basically euthanasia abortion poison shots
[1:12:57.360 --> 1:13:02.320]  and and and depopulation that vision for themselves
[1:13:02.320 --> 1:13:05.680]  that we've seen from a lot of not just democrats but republicans as well as
[1:13:05.680 --> 1:13:09.680]  i'm going to live forever and the age of humans is over
[1:13:09.680 --> 1:13:13.200]  and we're going to merge with machines and you know it's going to be so
[1:13:13.200 --> 1:13:17.040]  beautiful there'll be no humans by 2050 that's you've all harari you'll
[1:13:17.040 --> 1:13:20.640]  either evolve and accept this or you'll die
[1:13:20.640 --> 1:13:24.160]  that's their delusion so their plan for us is death
[1:13:24.160 --> 1:13:28.240]  and tyranny tyranny and death their plan for themselves is immortality and
[1:13:28.240 --> 1:13:32.400]  they're going to be gods that's the serpent in the garden
[1:13:32.400 --> 1:13:35.680]  it's the same lie over and over again so let me give the viewers and listeners
[1:13:35.680 --> 1:13:38.800]  the good news i go out on the street despite the fact
[1:13:38.800 --> 1:13:41.680]  and i'm attacked everywhere and as an average citizen which is a blessing
[1:13:41.680 --> 1:13:45.440]  believe me you don't want to be famous because you don't have to be
[1:13:45.440 --> 1:13:48.560]  the average person goes out and doesn't know if people are awake doesn't know
[1:13:48.560 --> 1:13:51.040]  people are patriots doesn't know if they're aware of the
[1:13:51.040 --> 1:13:54.000]  believe me all the attacks all the demonization
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:57.120]  whether i am in austin texas or whether i'm in florida
[1:13:57.120 --> 1:14:00.400]  or whether i'm in new york or whether i'm in canada or the uk
[1:14:00.400 --> 1:14:03.840]  or or whether i'm in los vegas or la i am

[1:14:09.920 --> 1:14:13.760]  and throw coffee on me stuff like that but the good news is
[1:14:13.760 --> 1:14:18.320]  they are screwed they have weird little leftist enclave areas
[1:14:18.320 --> 1:14:22.480]  in every city and they have their own you know the the universities they've
[1:14:22.480 --> 1:14:25.920]  taken over that charlie's trying to liberate but other than that the
[1:14:25.920 --> 1:14:29.760]  corporate media martha's vineyard these elite areas they all hide in
[1:14:29.760 --> 1:14:33.360]  the average person black white ispanic asian old young gay straight
[1:14:33.360 --> 1:14:37.360]  they just want freedom they just want a future they just want justice and so
[1:14:37.360 --> 1:14:40.080]  my book's number one in the world thanks to all you patriots getting out to
[1:14:40.080 --> 1:14:43.280]  people the great recent war of the world people are waking up and so don't get

[1:14:47.200 --> 1:14:50.320]  liberty in life and so it's like any fight when i was
[1:14:50.320 --> 1:14:52.720]  growing up in school and some bully was going to beat me up at her school because
[1:14:52.720 --> 1:14:55.760]  i dated his girlfriend i went ahead and just he didn't like it but i went
[1:14:55.760 --> 1:14:58.960]  ahead and went out and met him and as soon as this started flying i wasn't
[1:14:58.960 --> 1:15:02.800]  scared anymore and most of the time they got they went down and that's what i'm
[1:15:02.800 --> 1:15:06.080]  saying is is that this is where we are we were

[1:20:39.840 --> 1:20:45.360]  and fulfilling the host duties now and i think there's only one thing
[1:20:45.360 --> 1:20:50.000]  obviously there's only one thing that i should be talking about and obsessing
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:53.360]  over right now and that's the queen and royalty
[1:20:53.360 --> 1:20:58.640]  because it's the 21st century and we still believe in royalty yeah
[1:20:58.640 --> 1:21:04.080]  of course i'm being facetious julian odd one that every morning now for almost
[1:21:04.080 --> 1:21:08.320]  three weeks i wake up i turn my tv news on and it's
[1:21:08.320 --> 1:21:13.200]  following the next queen funeral the next queen funeral 30 funerals for the queen
[1:21:13.200 --> 1:21:19.120]  only george floyd could rival such a magnanimous departure
[1:21:19.120 --> 1:21:23.280]  from this planet ah it's royalty we still do royalty
[1:21:23.280 --> 1:21:30.000]  in this world apparently no i think um i think the royals should uh
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:35.360]  should decry royalty in this idea of a king and queen of course they won't
[1:21:35.360 --> 1:21:39.440]  but uh the obsession is weird i gotta tell you not my culture
[1:21:39.440 --> 1:21:47.040]  and i'm proud of that however we've got our own corrupt leadership we've got
[1:21:47.040 --> 1:21:51.360]  a president acting like he wishes he was king
[1:21:51.360 --> 1:21:55.680]  a democrat party that acts like they are royalty
[1:21:55.680 --> 1:22:02.320]  in their new lust for power and domination of your life now
[1:22:02.320 --> 1:22:06.880]  the regime face the face of the regime the puppet
[1:22:06.880 --> 1:22:13.040]  joe biden gave a 60 minutes interview that aired last night which
[1:22:13.040 --> 1:22:20.560]  surprisingly enough to me it was candid and even the
[1:22:20.560 --> 1:22:26.320]  60 minutes host scott pelley asked some pretty good questions now you know he
[1:22:26.320 --> 1:22:29.440]  fluffed it up he made sure that even though he
[1:22:29.440 --> 1:22:32.080]  was going to ask him a couple tough questions he gave him a nice fluffy
[1:22:32.080 --> 1:22:34.880]  pillow and bed to rest in while he was answering it
[1:22:34.880 --> 1:22:39.280]  he didn't he didn't press him too hard uh but he did ask some serious questions
[1:22:39.280 --> 1:22:45.200]  we're going to play some of those clips biden was more coherent than he
[1:22:45.200 --> 1:22:49.840]  typically is but yet still the signs of dementia
[1:22:49.840 --> 1:22:53.840]  and whatever else he is going through with his uh broken brain
[1:22:53.840 --> 1:22:57.040]  were apparent so let me get to some of the news headlines and then we'll play
[1:22:57.040 --> 1:23:03.520]  some of those clips from the 60 minutes interview
[1:23:03.520 --> 1:23:08.800]  joe biden says people disapprove of me because they are psychologically
[1:23:08.800 --> 1:23:16.480]  unable to be happy this is projection
[1:23:16.480 --> 1:23:20.640]  now what motivates joe biden to say something like that
[1:23:20.640 --> 1:23:26.640]  is odd because you wouldn't think that he's projecting this is a guy who's
[1:23:26.640 --> 1:23:32.240]  spent 50 percent of his presidency on vacation
[1:23:32.240 --> 1:23:37.920]  this is a guy who as soon as his wife was deceased had a much younger woman
[1:23:37.920 --> 1:23:44.160]  in bed ready to marry him again this is a man who goes to his
[1:23:44.160 --> 1:23:52.240]  beachfront mansion every weekend on your taxpayer dollar
[1:23:52.240 --> 1:23:59.200]  so is it biden that is projecting that he is unable to be happy
[1:23:59.200 --> 1:24:06.160]  or is he just understanding the modern-day democrat liberal mindset
[1:24:06.160 --> 1:24:11.360]  of misery loves company and that's who he's really addressing here
[1:24:11.360 --> 1:24:18.560]  because to me while conservatives and republicans or
[1:24:18.560 --> 1:24:22.480]  like-minded people are frustrated with the way things are going i don't see us
[1:24:22.480 --> 1:24:26.000]  unable to be happy i don't think we're psychologically unable to be happy i
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:28.480]  don't witness that at conservative events
[1:24:28.480 --> 1:24:32.400]  trump events or when i have events or hell
[1:24:32.400 --> 1:24:36.720]  even here on air on the alex joneshow or the war room or the american journal
[1:24:36.720 --> 1:24:39.920]  with harrison smith when we're covering some of the most serious news
[1:24:39.920 --> 1:24:43.840]  we've got plenty of time to be happy and jovial and crack jokes and laugh and
[1:24:43.840 --> 1:24:47.280]  have a smile so who is joe biden really talking
[1:24:47.280 --> 1:24:51.440]  about when he says people are psychologically unable to be happy
[1:24:51.440 --> 1:24:54.560]  i think it's pretty obvious i think that's the year your modern-day average
[1:24:54.560 --> 1:24:58.160]  liberal progressive democrat who finds misery and everything
[1:24:58.160 --> 1:25:02.000]  and the only time they find any enjoyment in life is when they're
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:06.640]  telling you what to do or censoring you or shutting down your business
[1:25:06.640 --> 1:25:13.360]  or abusing your children and then when they're denied access to those
[1:25:13.360 --> 1:25:18.720]  sorted activities that's when they start to lash out
[1:25:18.720 --> 1:25:25.920]  and get angry they need to control you and that's the biggest
[1:25:25.920 --> 1:25:29.360]  grab here that people need to understand whether
[1:25:29.360 --> 1:25:33.840]  you're whether you see yourself on the
[1:25:33.840 --> 1:25:37.520]  left side of the political spectrum or the right side of the political spectrum
[1:25:37.520 --> 1:25:42.720]  it's very very important we understand what each side really represents
[1:25:42.720 --> 1:25:47.920]  and i like to start off with this as kind of the launching pad
[1:25:47.920 --> 1:25:52.320]  just hypothetically speaking let's say that the country decided to
[1:25:52.320 --> 1:25:56.080]  divide into two countries and have a republican country and a democrat party
[1:25:56.080 --> 1:26:01.520]  country now let's just let's just pretend that this is a situation
[1:26:01.520 --> 1:26:08.880]  well why wouldn't that work out in the current political climate
[1:26:08.880 --> 1:26:13.280]  my guess is you could ask let's say let's say you ask 100 people that
[1:26:13.280 --> 1:26:17.840]  identifies democrat or republican my guess is 90 percent of republicans
[1:26:17.840 --> 1:26:21.440]  would say yes they'd be down for a country split at this point because they
[1:26:21.440 --> 1:26:25.440]  want nothing to do with democrat party leadership
[1:26:25.440 --> 1:26:31.360]  but despite all of the crying and moaning and whining and and attacks and
[1:26:31.360 --> 1:26:33.840]  lies against republicans that democrats say
[1:26:33.840 --> 1:26:37.200]  i bet if you ask democrats about splitting the country only
[1:26:37.200 --> 1:26:43.280]  10 of them would say it's a good thing now why would you have that difference
[1:26:43.280 --> 1:26:47.360]  why would you have a situation i mean let's or you could assume that democrats
[1:26:47.360 --> 1:26:50.160]  would like to see the country separated and they would say okay we'll have
[1:26:50.160 --> 1:26:53.600]  democrat run america and republican run america
[1:26:53.600 --> 1:26:59.280]  but democrats don't want that why why wouldn't the american left be in
[1:26:59.280 --> 1:27:02.400]  agreement with something like that
[1:27:02.960 --> 1:27:06.880]  there's two reasons one they already know that their policies are failures
[1:27:06.880 --> 1:27:10.880]  they're not stupid they know california and and and then new york and
[1:27:10.880 --> 1:27:14.480]  illinois are disasters of states run by democrats they
[1:27:14.480 --> 1:27:17.920]  know every major inner city that's run by democrats goes to hell
[1:27:17.920 --> 1:27:21.440]  within a decade st louis baltimore new orleans you name it
[1:27:21.440 --> 1:27:25.200]  it's all of them so so they know that their leadership destroys worlds
[1:27:25.200 --> 1:27:31.280]  but that's not really the problem here democrats
[1:27:31.280 --> 1:27:34.960]  the modern day american left is all about control
[1:27:34.960 --> 1:27:40.880]  it's all about subjugation so the modern day democrat party would not want a
[1:27:40.880 --> 1:27:45.120]  two party system in america where republicans have
[1:27:45.120 --> 1:27:49.040]  red states democrats have blue states they would never want that because
[1:27:49.040 --> 1:27:54.400]  their entire ideology is based off of controlling your
[1:27:54.400 --> 1:27:59.760]  life so sure republicans would say all right let's let's
[1:27:59.760 --> 1:28:03.120]  separate we just want to be independent of you guys trying to control our lives
[1:28:03.120 --> 1:28:06.240]  anyway democrats despite all the attacks they
[1:28:06.240 --> 1:28:08.880]  say about conservatives oh they're racist oh they're bigots oh they're
[1:28:08.880 --> 1:28:12.560]  xenophobic oh they're they're extremists oh they're hate groups
[1:28:12.560 --> 1:28:15.840]  okay well let's just separate then we'll we'll we'll have our lives you'll have
[1:28:15.840 --> 1:28:20.800]  yours no they can't have that because their entire
[1:28:20.800 --> 1:28:26.720]  their entire operational motivation is to control your life
[1:28:26.720 --> 1:28:30.720]  tell you how to protect your family and yourself tell you how to educate your
[1:28:30.720 --> 1:28:33.360]  children tell you how to spend your money
[1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:39.040]  tell you how to travel tell you what to eat tell you where and how to live
[1:28:39.040 --> 1:28:43.360]  so sure you asked a republican today they sure i'd love to have a separation
[1:28:43.360 --> 1:28:45.840]  between the republicans and the democrats split america
[1:28:45.840 --> 1:28:50.400]  into two different countries now but democrats would never have that because
[1:28:50.400 --> 1:28:55.200]  it's all about controlling you democrats want to tell you how to live your
[1:28:55.200 --> 1:28:57.520]  life
[1:28:59.040 --> 1:29:02.800]  info wars work has never been having a bigger effect than it's having right

[1:31:00.400 --> 1:31:04.080]  get our great bag of it here i mean this is from people say
[1:31:04.080 --> 1:31:08.160]  why is it from Chiapas Mexico the communist well that's where some of the
[1:31:08.160 --> 1:31:12.000]  best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic
[1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:15.040]  in the volcanic soil better than Guatemalan coffee and yeah
[1:31:15.040 --> 1:31:18.160]  we buy it from the little farmers that you know the media calls communists but
[1:31:18.160 --> 1:31:20.880]  really they're just a commune and whatever the point is is that it's
[1:31:20.880 --> 1:31:24.000]  good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican government
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:25.840]  take over so i actually buy this from the Mexican
[1:31:25.840 --> 1:31:28.880]  rebels and i've been buying it for what 14 years and the price has never gone up
[1:31:28.880 --> 1:31:32.480]  the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50 percent more
[1:31:32.480 --> 1:31:35.280]  per pound and i just think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna find
[1:31:35.280 --> 1:31:38.800]  anywhere it's wake up america patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels
[1:31:38.800 --> 1:31:42.880]  literally um in fact i'm gonna tell you a little story
[1:31:42.880 --> 1:31:49.440]  um we had like that okay you wouldn't believe it anyway so it's infowarstore.com
[1:31:49.440 --> 1:31:53.040]  and that's how we fund this operation and if you don't fund us you don't want to
[1:31:53.040 --> 1:31:55.760]  share that's fine
[1:31:55.760 --> 1:32:02.800]  the eugenicists over 100 years ago were very public about their plans they
[1:32:02.800 --> 1:32:07.280]  financed major universities they ran full page stories and
[1:32:07.280 --> 1:32:10.480]  advertisements pushing their propaganda of the new york times other major
[1:32:10.480 --> 1:32:14.560]  newspapers that the family as we know it is a bad thing
[1:32:14.560 --> 1:32:18.400]  it must be ended and the first step in that is getting women out of the
[1:32:18.400 --> 1:32:22.800]  household and teaching women that cooking dinner and taking care of their
[1:32:22.800 --> 1:32:26.480]  sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing and i was just sitting here
[1:32:26.480 --> 1:32:29.200]  tonight making dinner for my daughter my four
[1:32:29.200 --> 1:32:32.400]  national daughter my wife makes dinner a lot of dollars but i like to make it as
[1:32:32.400 --> 1:32:36.000]  well i love to make breakfast and literally it's the funnest thing on
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:38.320]  earth to make food for your family and be
[1:32:38.320 --> 1:32:42.960]  nurtured and then all sit down together and have the communal event
[1:32:42.960 --> 1:32:46.400]  and that's what the system is attacking and bombarding
[1:32:46.400 --> 1:32:50.400]  is our normal biological actions and coming together they really are
[1:32:50.400 --> 1:32:53.520]  sick evil scientific cult of filth that want to
[1:32:53.520 --> 1:32:59.360]  domesticate us and turn us into lab rats we cannot let this continue
[1:32:59.360 --> 1:33:03.840]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order
[1:33:03.840 --> 1:33:09.200]  it's alex jones
[1:33:15.280 --> 1:33:19.040]  so last night joe biden declared that the
[1:33:19.040 --> 1:33:25.280]  covid pandemic is over here is that clip from last night 60 minutes
[1:33:25.280 --> 1:33:28.160]  interview clip 14
[1:33:28.240 --> 1:33:33.040]  mr president first detroit auto show in three years yeah
[1:33:33.040 --> 1:33:39.120]  is the pandemic over the pandemic is over we still have a problem with covid
[1:33:39.120 --> 1:33:43.920]  we're still doing a lot of work on it uh it's but the pandemic is over if you
[1:33:43.920 --> 1:33:47.600]  notice no one's wearing masks everybody seems to be in pretty good shape
[1:33:47.600 --> 1:33:52.480]  and so i think it's changing and i think this is a perfect example of it
[1:33:52.480 --> 1:33:56.720]  total clown world stuff you could have had the deed you could have had the
[1:33:56.720 --> 1:34:00.880]  detroit auto show in 2020 and 2021 with no masks or vaccines and there wouldn't
[1:34:00.880 --> 1:34:05.360]  have been a pandemic then either that's what's so weird man that's the
[1:34:05.360 --> 1:34:09.280]  that's the crazy clown world that we're in today
[1:34:09.280 --> 1:34:13.360]  it's it's we're just playing games like little kids
[1:34:13.360 --> 1:34:16.400]  i mean doesn't it feel like that sometimes do you ever play make believe
[1:34:16.400 --> 1:34:19.600]  with your cousins or your your friends growing up when you're little kids you
[1:34:19.600 --> 1:34:23.440]  play make believe that's what this is is it's grown
[1:34:23.440 --> 1:34:27.680]  adults and our government playing make believe but forcing us
[1:34:27.680 --> 1:34:34.560]  into their clown world make believe world that doesn't exist
[1:34:34.560 --> 1:34:37.920]  now okay biden declares the pandemic is over
[1:34:37.920 --> 1:34:42.320]  we'll see if the white house uh tries to retract that statement like they've
[1:34:42.320 --> 1:34:48.240]  had to retract others that he made last night on the 60 minutes interview
[1:34:48.240 --> 1:34:54.400]  but that hasn't stopped the vaccine pushers from pushing their vaccines
[1:34:54.400 --> 1:34:58.400]  now there's been a realization
[1:34:58.400 --> 1:35:02.800]  some sectors of the government now nobody's being outright honest about
[1:35:02.800 --> 1:35:06.960]  this vaccine uh that that promoted it because they know how
[1:35:06.960 --> 1:35:10.080]  bad it is that's like
[1:35:10.080 --> 1:35:16.000]  i mean it'd be like if you were the snack provider for uh
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:20.480]  let's say a youth peewee football team and you were the snack provider at
[1:35:20.480 --> 1:35:23.200]  halftime and you brought oranges orange slices or
[1:35:23.200 --> 1:35:27.520]  something for the whole team at halftime and then the entire team got sick
[1:35:27.520 --> 1:35:31.040]  in the second half and it's like uh-oh you knew it was from what you well
[1:35:31.040 --> 1:35:35.120]  oh i don't know anything about that maybe we should stop having snack time
[1:35:35.120 --> 1:35:38.240]  i think snack time was the problem it's like no you gave them
[1:35:38.240 --> 1:35:42.320]  bad snacks you gave them poison snacks like no no i think maybe just snack
[1:35:42.320 --> 1:35:45.520]  time in general is the problem and we should just end snack time
[1:35:45.520 --> 1:35:48.960]  like well okay maybe we should end snack time but
[1:35:48.960 --> 1:35:54.080]  we know what you did so now certain areas are backing off the vaccine mandates
[1:35:54.080 --> 1:35:58.080]  like in the military because they know that this
[1:35:58.080 --> 1:36:02.720]  covid-19 vaccine is probably the biggest humanitarian
[1:36:02.720 --> 1:36:09.760]  pharmaceutical disaster maybe world history but certainly modern history
[1:36:09.760 --> 1:36:12.320]  and that's saying something because there have been vaccines that have already
[1:36:12.320 --> 1:36:16.320]  caused disasters like they vaccine caused a polio outbreak in africa
[1:36:16.320 --> 1:36:20.400]  looks like it's about to cause a polio outbreak in new york city
[1:36:20.400 --> 1:36:23.600]  you've had of course the experimentation on individuals
[1:36:23.600 --> 1:36:27.600]  with vaccines like the tuskegee experiment
[1:36:27.600 --> 1:36:31.520]  you've had deadly drugs pushed by the system that get pulled off the market so
[1:36:31.520 --> 1:36:34.160]  i mean there have been a lot of pharmaceutical
[1:36:34.160 --> 1:36:38.000]  disasters that have killed millions of people i mean hell just opioids in
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:43.120]  general kill millions of people pharmaceutical drugs
[1:36:43.120 --> 1:36:47.040]  but so all the vaccine pushers now know it's bad and there's
[1:36:47.040 --> 1:36:51.040]  two responses one you either back off of it knowing the vaccine has been
[1:36:51.040 --> 1:36:58.240]  a complete disaster or two you double down and in your confidence
[1:36:58.240 --> 1:37:02.720]  that's the big act is this is the con game of oh the vaccine is great look at
[1:37:02.720 --> 1:37:05.840]  how confident i am in it
[1:37:05.840 --> 1:37:09.360]  but the numbers are in and it's not going so well so we'll see if the white
[1:37:09.360 --> 1:37:14.960]  house sticks by biden statement that covid pandemic is over
[1:37:14.960 --> 1:37:17.920]  as they continue to push those deadly vaccines
[1:37:17.920 --> 1:37:23.360]  that that don't just not do a damn thing to stop covid
[1:37:23.360 --> 1:37:26.480]  they're they're going to do more harm than good and almost
[1:37:26.480 --> 1:37:29.920]  every study the further we get into this and more
[1:37:29.920 --> 1:37:34.000]  and newer studies come out every study is now indicating what we all knew from
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:37.520]  the beginning the covid vaccine destroys your immune system
[1:37:37.520 --> 1:37:41.200]  the covid vaccine gives you all kinds of other negative side effects that have
[1:37:41.200 --> 1:37:44.480]  nothing to do with even covid heart problems stroke
[1:37:44.480 --> 1:37:50.320]  guion beret you name it so it's either double down and pretend like you're
[1:37:50.320 --> 1:37:54.320]  still confident in the vaccines like trump has done like a jackass
[1:37:54.320 --> 1:37:59.120]  or you back off the mandates and the promotion of the vaccines and just say
[1:37:59.120 --> 1:38:02.080]  well we're just we're just not doing mandates and promotions anymore
[1:38:02.080 --> 1:38:05.600]  but you don't tell people why
[1:38:06.320 --> 1:38:11.040]  and so that's where it's going following us navy's change to vaccine mandate
[1:38:11.040 --> 1:38:16.400]  policy us marine corps follows yeah they see how much of a disaster this has
[1:38:16.400 --> 1:38:20.240]  been and uh what a humanitarian crisis the
[1:38:20.240 --> 1:38:24.880]  vaccine is with the deadly side effects but
[1:38:24.880 --> 1:38:28.480]  not everybody is going that direction new york city
[1:38:28.480 --> 1:38:33.440]  there it is run by the tyrannical democrats new york city fires another
[1:38:33.440 --> 1:38:37.440]  850 teachers and teaching aides after they failed to get the covid
[1:38:37.440 --> 1:38:41.920]  vaccine by september 5th deadline bringing the total number
[1:38:41.920 --> 1:38:47.040]  to 1950 terminated by department of education since vaccine mandate took
[1:38:47.040 --> 1:38:50.560]  effect so there is no pandemic the vaccine doesn't stop you from getting
[1:38:50.560 --> 1:38:53.600]  covid or spreading covid it's actually negative on you it's
[1:38:53.600 --> 1:38:56.720]  basically just straight up a poison i mean that's really what is at this
[1:38:56.720 --> 1:39:00.720]  point the vaccine is just a straight up poison
[1:39:00.720 --> 1:39:05.600]  but they're still making you get it in new york city because
[1:39:05.600 --> 1:39:13.200]  democrats tyrants authoritarians fascists totalitarians conformists
[1:39:13.200 --> 1:39:19.600]  what other words can we use here so the the military says okay
[1:39:19.600 --> 1:39:24.560]  this vaccine has been a disaster let's back off the mandates
[1:39:24.560 --> 1:39:27.600]  but the tyrannical democrats that run the new york city educational system
[1:39:27.600 --> 1:39:31.840]  they say let's double down on our con game with the vaccine
[1:39:31.840 --> 1:39:35.840]  but see there's another element to this that the left understands
[1:39:35.840 --> 1:39:42.000]  in their totalitarian nature keeping the vaccine mandate is more important to
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:46.800]  them because it weeds out free thinkers it weeds out non-conformists
[1:39:46.800 --> 1:39:51.280]  it weeds out in their eyes conservatives
[1:39:51.280 --> 1:39:54.720]  and so the new york city education system is not keeping the vaccine around
[1:39:54.720 --> 1:39:57.920]  because they think it works or protects from covid or the safety of their
[1:39:57.920 --> 1:40:02.160]  teachers and students the new york city education department
[1:40:02.160 --> 1:40:06.320]  is keeping the vaccine as a mandate as a filter
[1:40:06.320 --> 1:40:09.280]  to keep non-conformists out of the classroom
[1:40:09.280 --> 1:40:12.560]  conservatives christians and all these people out of the classroom
[1:40:12.560 --> 1:40:16.320]  they want totality in the education department they
[1:40:16.320 --> 1:40:20.400]  only want radical leftist teaching children they only want radical leftist
[1:40:20.400 --> 1:40:23.760]  indoctrinating children that's why the new york city education
[1:40:23.760 --> 1:40:26.960]  department is keeping the vaccine around has nothing to do with health and
[1:40:26.960 --> 1:40:32.080]  safety has everything to do with control over the teachers
[1:40:32.080 --> 1:40:36.240]  that are indoctrinating the children in new york city
[1:40:36.240 --> 1:40:40.720]  but uh you know what's going to be amazing to witness
[1:40:40.720 --> 1:40:43.920]  and we're already really witnessing it we just
[1:40:43.920 --> 1:40:47.280]  haven't realized that this is what's happening
[1:40:47.280 --> 1:40:53.040]  new york city at some points in modern history could have been considered the
[1:40:53.040 --> 1:40:57.200]  greatest city on earth a bastion of a hive of activity and
[1:40:57.200 --> 1:41:02.000]  civilization and and and human experience
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:05.760]  has now been completely turned into a dystopian
[1:41:05.760 --> 1:41:10.640]  hellhole by democrats and you know it's really a story that doesn't get talked
[1:41:10.640 --> 1:41:16.320]  about enough the greatness the once great bastion
[1:41:16.320 --> 1:41:21.360]  of human civilization new york city is now a bastion of democrat party and
[1:41:21.360 --> 1:41:26.320]  globalist tyranny and a third world hellhole
[1:41:26.960 --> 1:41:31.280]  less than half of manhattan workers have returned to the office
[1:41:31.280 --> 1:41:34.560]  well yeah uh once you go kami and you're a lazy bum
[1:41:34.560 --> 1:41:39.040]  you never want to go back yeah people that like taking other people's money
[1:41:39.040 --> 1:41:42.480]  and hard earned money and and energy of course they never want to go back to
[1:41:42.480 --> 1:41:45.840]  work they're lazy bums
[1:41:47.200 --> 1:41:51.440]  and they got to keep the fear dreaded side effect rears its ugly head in latest
[1:41:51.440 --> 1:41:55.120]  covid variant you know i got to tell you i think uh i think what's going on
[1:41:55.120 --> 1:41:58.000]  here and uh we had doctors already warned us that this
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:02.960]  would be the case i really think this truly was an aliyup
[1:42:02.960 --> 1:42:06.560]  attack on humanity to to kill a large number of people and it's
[1:42:06.560 --> 1:42:09.600]  works very well and i don't think the numbers are final yet folks
[1:42:09.600 --> 1:42:12.720]  especially with people continuing to put this poison into their veins
[1:42:12.720 --> 1:42:16.880]  they created the virus in a lab they made it highly contagious
[1:42:16.880 --> 1:42:21.360]  deadly if you're if you're morbidly obese or have co-morbidities
[1:42:21.360 --> 1:42:26.400]  but that was half of the biological warfare against humans on this planet
[1:42:26.400 --> 1:42:30.560]  the second half and the key was the vaccine
[1:42:30.560 --> 1:42:33.360]  because most people are going to survive their man-made virus but what
[1:42:33.360 --> 1:42:36.560]  happens is you're not going to you're not going to survive five of these
[1:42:36.560 --> 1:42:41.120]  vaccines and the vaccinated are now creating variants
[1:42:41.120 --> 1:42:43.840]  of covid that are just going to kill the vaccinated people
[1:42:43.840 --> 1:42:47.680]  so if you never got a vaccine and you've got natural immunity you're fine
[1:42:47.680 --> 1:42:51.200]  you might get covid here and there because the vaccinated keep spreading
[1:42:51.200 --> 1:42:54.400]  their variants but the numbers are going to be
[1:42:54.400 --> 1:42:57.760]  overwhelming pretty soon of how many vaccinated people are dying
[1:42:57.760 --> 1:43:02.240]  it's the fourth coin that we've released the last year
[1:43:02.240 --> 1:43:06.080]  and i believe the most powerful the man in the arena coin
[1:43:06.080 --> 1:43:12.400]  teddy rose the vote citizen of a republic the man in the arena
[1:43:12.400 --> 1:43:16.240]  there's only 10 000 of this coin and it exists in the world
[1:43:16.240 --> 1:43:20.880]  it will never be made again that's not just an amazing historic coin
[1:43:20.880 --> 1:43:24.480]  it funds the information war against the globalist
[1:43:24.480 --> 1:43:27.040]  this is something you want to hand down to your grandchildren

[1:43:31.360 --> 1:43:34.480]  funding the information war against the globalist

[1:43:56.000 --> 1:44:01.520]  1776coin.com the globalists are bombarding us with propaganda
[1:44:01.520 --> 1:44:05.600]  and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the
[1:44:05.600 --> 1:44:08.480]  food it's all come out and they're doing that not
[1:44:08.480 --> 1:44:12.800]  because we're weak but because we're made the image of god the creator and we
[1:44:12.800 --> 1:44:17.360]  are powerful and the social engineers fear that so much
[1:44:17.360 --> 1:44:20.800]  so that's why i repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who
[1:44:20.800 --> 1:44:25.040]  first came up with the boy is it true
[1:44:25.040 --> 1:44:29.360]  the propaganda would not be necessary if the situation
[1:44:29.360 --> 1:44:33.440]  was hopeless they need all their propaganda and all their lies and all
[1:44:33.440 --> 1:44:37.280]  their evil and all their cultural death because
[1:44:37.280 --> 1:44:41.760]  they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the god of this
[1:44:41.760 --> 1:44:45.040]  world who is a loser and that's why it's so important that
[1:44:45.040 --> 1:44:48.240]  everybody keep them full wars in the air now more than ever because even you
[1:44:48.240 --> 1:44:50.640]  don't believe in god what the globalists are
[1:44:50.640 --> 1:44:54.960]  manifesting and setting up is satanic and we are opposing the one world
[1:44:54.960 --> 1:44:58.000]  government and the mark of the beast they just announced
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:03.760]  our world is so full of hype we're force-fed dehumanizing propaganda by
[1:45:03.760 --> 1:45:06.480]  the corporate media by the controlled churches and the
[1:45:06.480 --> 1:45:10.720]  universities why is this the case because we innately
[1:45:10.720 --> 1:45:16.080]  by god have been given the keys for our own minds our own sides our own souls
[1:45:16.080 --> 1:45:19.040]  and by connecting to god we can empower ourselves
[1:45:19.040 --> 1:45:23.520]  and transcend the quote fallen or sinful stick
[1:45:23.520 --> 1:45:27.200]  so the chemicals that we ingest and all the things we try to bring into our
[1:45:27.200 --> 1:45:31.680]  bodies to change who we are are only lowering us they're
[1:45:31.680 --> 1:45:34.720]  only making us more depressed from the end they're only making us less
[1:45:34.720 --> 1:45:38.000]  fulfilled it is only by going within and really
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:41.280]  making the connection to god that we can truly empower ourselves
[1:45:41.280 --> 1:45:44.480]  that's why the globalist bombardists and toxins and chemicals
[1:45:44.480 --> 1:45:48.240]  to block us getting the normal vitamins and minerals and trace elements our
[1:45:48.240 --> 1:45:52.560]  bodies need to be healthy and to be able to basically reach out

[1:47:03.040 --> 1:47:06.480]  it's alex jones
[1:47:17.440 --> 1:47:21.280]  so joe biden says the pandemic is over so why are we still
[1:47:21.280 --> 1:47:26.320]  promoting these vaccines that only have emergency use authorization
[1:47:26.320 --> 1:47:30.880]  and haven't even been tested on humans well that doesn't make sense it doesn't
[1:47:30.880 --> 1:47:35.120]  have to you're in the clown world run by biden and
[1:47:35.120 --> 1:47:39.200]  gene pierre and kamala harris and democrats you know where men can get
[1:47:39.200 --> 1:47:43.040]  pregnant and men or women it's the clown world
[1:47:43.040 --> 1:47:48.080]  we're just living in it but that's not the only
[1:47:48.080 --> 1:47:52.640]  lies joe biden was telling on his 60 minutes interview
[1:47:52.640 --> 1:47:56.320]  oh the pandemic is over now it's been over jack
[1:47:56.320 --> 1:48:00.720]  just up an inch joe biden downplays his record eight in that
[1:48:00.720 --> 1:48:03.760]  8.2 inflation number that was just in august
[1:48:03.760 --> 1:48:07.200]  that number it's i think it's about 13 or 14 percent
[1:48:07.200 --> 1:48:12.800]  overall since he got into office uh so he he he tries to downplays
[1:48:12.800 --> 1:48:17.840]  downplay that as he destroys the middle class in this country
[1:48:17.840 --> 1:48:21.440]  and so credit to scott pelley for asking the question
[1:48:21.440 --> 1:48:27.680]  and uh here he asks what is biden doing about inflation in clip 11
[1:48:27.680 --> 1:48:31.200]  mr president as you know last tuesday the annual
[1:48:31.200 --> 1:48:37.280]  inflation rate came in at 8.3 percent the stock market nose dived
[1:48:37.280 --> 1:48:41.040]  people are shocked by their grocery bills
[1:48:41.040 --> 1:48:45.200]  what can you do better pause it real quick
[1:48:45.680 --> 1:48:51.360]  so all of that was happening last week while joe biden and the democrats
[1:48:51.360 --> 1:48:55.440]  were partying with james taylor clinking glasses on the success of their economy
[1:48:55.440 --> 1:48:58.480]  i mean
[1:48:58.480 --> 1:49:02.640]  these are this is this is a historic time in america
[1:49:02.640 --> 1:49:06.880]  this is the fall of a great nation now we can still revive ourselves we can
[1:49:06.880 --> 1:49:09.840]  still crawl out of this hole that we've been put in
[1:49:09.840 --> 1:49:15.760]  this this darkness but the historical
[1:49:15.760 --> 1:49:19.200]  application of this is truly underappreciated right now because we're
[1:49:19.200 --> 1:49:23.040]  living this history joe biden and the democrats partying with
[1:49:23.040 --> 1:49:27.200]  james taylor on the white house lawn about the successes of the economy
[1:49:27.200 --> 1:49:33.680]  as the economy is being crushed is truly historical
[1:49:34.320 --> 1:49:39.440]  it's it's their fall of roam moment it's it's their caligula moment i mean it
[1:49:39.440 --> 1:49:45.760]  it's their clown world moment it's the full transparency
[1:49:45.760 --> 1:49:49.120]  of democrat party leadership that doesn't give a damn
[1:49:49.120 --> 1:49:54.240]  about you and as long as they feel good and as long as they're up there telling
[1:49:54.240 --> 1:49:57.200]  their lies all as well in their world
[1:49:57.200 --> 1:50:00.560]  however you're going your life being crushed doesn't matter
[1:50:00.560 --> 1:50:04.960]  the reality of the situation doesn't matter
[1:50:04.960 --> 1:50:08.880]  they're democrats they're in charge and that's all that matters so they're
[1:50:08.880 --> 1:50:11.760]  clinking glasses and celebrating how great of a job they're doing
[1:50:11.760 --> 1:50:18.800]  as they're destroying your country truly that is a historical moment that
[1:50:18.800 --> 1:50:23.760]  white house lawn party of the democrats celebrating the economy
[1:50:23.760 --> 1:50:27.600]  that they've destroyed will go down in us history
[1:50:27.600 --> 1:50:30.880]  as as one of the biggest clown moments of
[1:50:30.880 --> 1:50:34.480]  our country's history and and the white house's history in fact that
[1:50:34.480 --> 1:50:38.640]  that might be the biggest clown moment in
[1:50:38.640 --> 1:50:44.320]  the white house's history democrats partying with james taylor
[1:50:44.320 --> 1:50:48.960]  celebrating the success of the economy that they've destroyed
[1:50:48.960 --> 1:50:52.640]  i don't even think we can really fathom just
[1:50:52.640 --> 1:50:57.520]  how ludicrous and historical that was that will be written about and looked
[1:50:57.520 --> 1:51:02.240]  back in time as a moment in history of this is how
[1:51:02.240 --> 1:51:07.280]  low america fell this is how big of a joke america became
[1:51:07.280 --> 1:51:11.520]  and hopefully we rise from there but let's go back let's go back i apologize
[1:51:11.520 --> 1:51:14.800]  interrupting the clip here's joe biden downplaying
[1:51:14.800 --> 1:51:18.240]  the destruction of the u.s economy that he has ushered in
[1:51:18.240 --> 1:51:22.720]  eight point three percent the stock market nose dived
[1:51:22.720 --> 1:51:29.120]  people are shocked by their grocery bills what can you do better and faster
[1:51:29.120 --> 1:51:32.880]  well first of all let's put this in perspective inflation rate month to
[1:51:32.880 --> 1:51:36.640]  month was this just an inch hardly at all
[1:51:36.640 --> 1:51:40.080]  you're not arguing that eight point three is good news no i'm not saying it's
[1:51:40.080 --> 1:51:43.600]  good news but it was eight point two or eight point two before i mean it's not
[1:51:43.600 --> 1:51:46.880]  you're right maybe i can make it sound like all of a sudden my god it went to
[1:51:46.880 --> 1:51:50.320]  eight point two percent that's what is the highest inflation rate mr
[1:51:50.320 --> 1:51:54.640]  president in 40 years i got that but guess what we are
[1:51:54.640 --> 1:51:58.240]  we're in a position where for the last several months it hasn't played
[1:51:58.240 --> 1:52:03.120]  but again folks the dementia here i mean he did a pretty good job i think
[1:52:03.120 --> 1:52:05.760]  covering it up overall in the interview but it's still
[1:52:05.760 --> 1:52:09.280]  the slurring of the words the mush mouth the unable to think
[1:52:09.280 --> 1:52:13.600]  critically in the i mean obviously he's not all there
[1:52:13.600 --> 1:52:20.320]  but i mean again i i don't even know see the issue is
[1:52:21.600 --> 1:52:26.240]  people still believe this clown people still believe the lies of the mainstream
[1:52:26.240 --> 1:52:31.520]  meeting the democrat party so joe biden has enough confidence
[1:52:31.520 --> 1:52:35.680]  see it's just like anthony fouchy saying oh i never said to lock anything down
[1:52:35.680 --> 1:52:40.320]  that little that little garden gnome rat was the first one saying to lock
[1:52:40.320 --> 1:52:43.920]  things down i never promoted the vaccines what are you talking
[1:52:43.920 --> 1:52:47.280]  about you did 10 interviews a day promoting the vaccines
[1:52:47.280 --> 1:52:52.880]  anthony fouchy is so confident in the corrupt media
[1:52:52.880 --> 1:52:56.160]  that they will cover up his lies and cover up his activities
[1:52:56.160 --> 1:53:00.960]  that he just boldly lies right to your face same with joe biden
[1:53:00.960 --> 1:53:07.520]  because they're fascists folks they're in a cult and they control all of the
[1:53:07.520 --> 1:53:10.960]  establishment media and so they're so confident that they
[1:53:10.960 --> 1:53:14.240]  have total control of the narrative with their corrupt media
[1:53:14.240 --> 1:53:17.920]  that they can lie directly to your face and get away with it that joe biden
[1:53:17.920 --> 1:53:21.520]  can act like inflation hasn't been a problem in this country so what it's
[1:53:21.520 --> 1:53:24.240]  just like an inch
[1:53:24.640 --> 1:53:29.920]  well boy oh boy how many things do we refer to as a game of inches
[1:53:29.920 --> 1:53:33.440]  sometimes an inch is a pretty big deal isn't it sometimes an inch can make the
[1:53:33.440 --> 1:53:36.400]  difference between a win and a loss can it but
[1:53:36.400 --> 1:53:43.280]  okay forget about the analogies just an outright lie to act like
[1:53:43.280 --> 1:53:49.280]  8.3 inflation is just an inch or to act like 8.3 inflation is not a
[1:53:49.280 --> 1:53:53.680]  serious number because it's all historic
[1:53:53.680 --> 1:53:57.520]  it's a historic rise in inflation everybody knows it and joe biden
[1:53:57.520 --> 1:54:01.360]  is so confident that he can lie to you and the mainstream media will cover
[1:54:01.360 --> 1:54:04.320]  for him and so that's what he does right here so
[1:54:04.320 --> 1:54:07.040]  guys just run that like 10 or so seconds and let's go back to it so
[1:54:07.040 --> 1:54:10.560]  joe biden mushmouth here dementia ridden biden
[1:54:10.560 --> 1:54:14.880]  with his mushmouth acting like inflation has not been a problem
[1:54:14.880 --> 1:54:19.040]  while he's in office only able to do so because he knows that the corrupt media
[1:54:19.040 --> 1:54:22.960]  is in his back pocket we're 8.2 before i mean it's not you're
[1:54:22.960 --> 1:54:27.520]  i may actually make it sound like all of a sudden my god it went to 8.2 percent
[1:54:27.520 --> 1:54:32.400]  it's the highest inflation rate mr president in 40 years i got that but
[1:54:32.400 --> 1:54:36.480]  guess what we are we're in a position where for the last several months it
[1:54:36.480 --> 1:54:39.280]  hasn't spiked it has just barely it's been
[1:54:39.280 --> 1:54:43.920]  positive even and the number that scott pelie brought up
[1:54:43.920 --> 1:54:48.800]  was the month of august folks literally last month
[1:54:48.800 --> 1:54:52.960]  he goes it's not like that number is from the last month
[1:54:52.960 --> 1:54:57.200]  it's literally from the last month continue
[1:54:57.200 --> 1:55:02.320]  meantime we created all these jobs and prices have
[1:55:02.320 --> 1:55:06.480]  have gone up but they've come down for energy the fact is that
[1:55:06.480 --> 1:55:10.480]  we've created 10 million new jobs pause this right here sense
[1:55:10.480 --> 1:55:14.560]  now this is a little confusing to me i'm not going to pretend to have all the
[1:55:14.560 --> 1:55:17.120]  answers sometimes i i i just have questions
[1:55:17.120 --> 1:55:20.720]  maybe the question is the answer i this one is a little confusing to me because
[1:55:20.720 --> 1:55:23.360]  look trump claimed he had the most jobs created
[1:55:23.360 --> 1:55:26.640]  biden claims he has the most jobs created i mean how how are you really to
[1:55:26.640 --> 1:55:29.680]  know and my answer would be well what does it
[1:55:29.680 --> 1:55:33.360]  look like what does the world look like when i go out into it
[1:55:33.360 --> 1:55:37.760]  i gotta say i mean i've never seen in my life
[1:55:37.760 --> 1:55:42.320]  more help wanted signs than i see now and maybe that's because austin is booming
[1:55:42.320 --> 1:55:46.560]  i don't know but i mean you drive around austin you drive around the town just
[1:55:46.560 --> 1:55:51.360]  for 10 20 minutes whatever and folks it's help wanted signs everywhere
[1:55:51.360 --> 1:55:57.040]  $20 an hour starting wage i mean i've never seen that before i
[1:55:57.040 --> 1:56:00.240]  remember when i was in college and before that like
[1:56:00.240 --> 1:56:04.080]  you could find a job but it took a bit of an effort you might have to apply a
[1:56:04.080 --> 1:56:06.960]  couple places do a couple interviews and you'd be lucky
[1:56:06.960 --> 1:56:10.800]  if you could get $10 an hour i'm not that old i'm 33 we're talking just 10 plus
[1:56:10.800 --> 1:56:15.760]  years ago here but now i mean my goodness
[1:56:15.760 --> 1:56:19.040]  with inflation i guess $20 an hour ain't what it used to be
[1:56:19.040 --> 1:56:23.200]  but still i mean i can i can drive for five miles
[1:56:23.200 --> 1:56:28.160]  in austin and i'll find 10 jobs where i could start immediately making $20 an
[1:56:28.160 --> 1:56:33.360]  hour so what's out about that is why is nobody
[1:56:33.360 --> 1:56:36.560]  taking these jobs that's the real question here
[1:56:36.560 --> 1:56:39.840]  so maybe the jobs have been created why is nobody taking them but let's
[1:56:39.840 --> 1:56:42.560]  continue here and finish up this section of the interview
[1:56:42.560 --> 1:56:46.480]  the fact is that we've created 10 million new jobs
[1:56:46.480 --> 1:56:50.080]  we're in a sense we came to office we're in a situation where
[1:56:50.080 --> 1:56:54.400]  we the unemployment rate is about 3.7 percent one the lowest in history
[1:56:54.400 --> 1:56:57.600]  we're in a situation where manufacturing is coming back to the united
[1:56:57.600 --> 1:57:02.160]  states in a big way yeah i just can't believe any of what he's
[1:57:02.160 --> 1:57:05.360]  saying i don't know why people aren't working
[1:57:05.360 --> 1:57:10.560]  but it's not for a lack of jobs uh but people are definitely struggling more
[1:57:10.560 --> 1:57:14.160]  so than they have under trump i would say 10 year treasury yield
[1:57:14.160 --> 1:57:18.960]  jumps to 3.5 percent the highest level since 2011
[1:57:18.960 --> 1:57:25.360]  since 2011 since 2011 last time democrats were in the white house see
[1:57:25.360 --> 1:57:28.320]  there's a theme here when did russia invade ukraine last when
[1:57:28.320 --> 1:57:31.920]  democrats were in the white house when was the last time inflation was this
[1:57:31.920 --> 1:57:35.040]  bad when democrats were in the white house
[1:57:35.040 --> 1:57:38.320]  there's a common theme here to all of our problems
[1:57:38.320 --> 1:57:41.760]  and what is that theme class say it with me
[1:57:41.760 --> 1:57:46.160]  democrats there we go we're learning
[1:57:48.800 --> 1:57:52.160]  the best-selling book in america last week was the great reset

[1:58:00.720 --> 1:58:03.040]  lied about that because the new york times doesn't want you to know that
[1:58:03.040 --> 1:58:06.640]  the new york times wants you to believe that alex jones is more discredited than
[1:58:06.640 --> 1:58:09.760]  the new york times the paper that started the iraq war
[1:58:09.760 --> 1:58:12.880]  by lying about weapons mass destruction and got a million people killed

[2:00:35.920 --> 2:00:40.320]  it just flows off of his tongue like he doesn't even think twice about
[2:00:40.320 --> 2:00:43.840]  whether it's making up stories about riding on the amtrak making up store
[2:00:43.840 --> 2:00:47.840]  about a guy who worked there telling him about how many miles he's traveled
[2:00:47.840 --> 2:00:52.960]  when the guy had long been deceased uh to joe biden's
[2:00:52.960 --> 2:00:57.200]  history in pennsylvania that never existed or
[2:00:57.200 --> 2:01:02.160]  his scholarly achievements in college that also didn't exist
[2:01:02.160 --> 2:01:07.840]  i mean the guy just makes stuff up all the time he's a known plagiarist as well
[2:01:07.840 --> 2:01:13.360]  and the latest uh big big lie from joe biden that goes unchecked
[2:01:13.360 --> 2:01:16.560]  because he just lies it's just it's it's it's common for joe biden to just talk
[2:01:16.560 --> 2:01:20.480]  he just lies it just flows joe biden tells britt's queen elizabeth
[2:01:20.480 --> 2:01:24.960]  reminded him of his mother just he's just making that up he's just lying
[2:01:24.960 --> 2:01:28.400]  problem is joe's mother was a vicious woman who hated the queen
[2:01:28.400 --> 2:01:32.960]  and wrote nasty poems about her that's funny isn't it
[2:01:32.960 --> 2:01:37.360]  but see joe biden sees who the queen's dead i can i can build myself off this
[2:01:37.360 --> 2:01:40.320]  i can get some momentum off the queen's death i'll say that the queen
[2:01:40.320 --> 2:01:43.840]  reminded me of my mother that'll be good for my ratings that'll be a good tv
[2:01:43.840 --> 2:01:47.680]  clip totally untrue it's complete lie
[2:01:47.680 --> 2:01:54.160]  but uh it's joe biden and so if he's not lying he's not talking
[2:01:54.160 --> 2:01:58.160]  and man oh man i gotta tell you the obsession
[2:01:58.160 --> 2:02:04.160]  over the royal family is just honestly it's kind of disgusting really
[2:02:04.160 --> 2:02:09.280]  look it's not my culture i'm not from england
[2:02:09.280 --> 2:02:13.760]  you know i've kind of in my confusion over the obsession i've read some
[2:02:13.760 --> 2:02:17.920]  stories trying to explain it and i just i'm sorry i just don't get it
[2:02:17.920 --> 2:02:23.920]  i just don't get this obsession with royalty it's kind of pathetic actually
[2:02:23.920 --> 2:02:27.120]  but uh the queen elizabeth funeral for the 30th time there
[2:02:27.120 --> 2:02:30.320]  uh every morning i wake up turn on the news look i'm gonna get some news here
[2:02:30.320 --> 2:02:34.160]  to start my day queen elizabeth funeral
[2:02:34.160 --> 2:02:38.400]  i'm sick of it but the obsession is real
[2:02:38.400 --> 2:02:44.560]  and real pathetic uh just like joe biden's dementia now so he claims oh he
[2:02:44.560 --> 2:02:49.360]  has no problems he's he's as fit as a fiddle he's as sharp as a tack
[2:02:49.360 --> 2:02:52.480]  he's the smartest guy in the room and less hunters in the room with him
[2:02:52.480 --> 2:02:56.000]  doing crack cocaine or parmesan cheese he's not sure the difference at this
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:58.720]  point and he says he's broke while he's cutting million
[2:02:58.720 --> 2:03:02.640]  dollar deals with chinese nationals but he won't pay child support
[2:03:02.640 --> 2:03:06.240]  and i'm sure joe couldn't afford to fork a few bucks over to his illegitimate
[2:03:06.240 --> 2:03:11.280]  grandson uh that uh hunter knocked up a stripper
[2:03:11.280 --> 2:03:16.320]  to get but so here is a little reminder biden denies he has dementia but here's
[2:03:16.320 --> 2:03:20.880]  the clips proving he doesn't 15 watch me if you think i don't have the energy
[2:03:20.880 --> 2:03:24.400]  level of mental acuity the best way to get something

[2:03:47.200 --> 2:03:53.760]  yeah america is a nation that can be defined in a single word
[2:03:53.760 --> 2:04:02.320]  i was gonna put him in the foot the idea that um

[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:13.600]  one to

[2:04:21.200 --> 2:04:25.120]  make my say another way with the nature
[2:04:25.120 --> 2:04:35.440]  not a solid meeting with um with uh the uh they make a very good point here's
[2:04:35.440 --> 2:04:37.920]  the deal

[2:06:23.040 --> 2:06:26.800]  liberal progressive democrat globalist conformist tyrants authoritarian
[2:06:26.800 --> 2:06:30.320]  fascists maybe we maybe they got it right you know
[2:06:30.320 --> 2:06:33.760]  maybe life sucks maybe we should just be slaves and die
[2:06:33.760 --> 2:06:36.720]  you know what are we doing here enjoying life and consciousness and
[2:06:36.720 --> 2:06:41.840]  this divine creation we're so stupid
[2:06:41.840 --> 2:06:46.640]  we should just we should just let the democrats destroy america destroy
[2:06:46.640 --> 2:06:50.400]  freedom at the hands of the behest of the globalists
[2:06:50.400 --> 2:06:54.160]  and uh we should stop driving cars and stop flying on airplanes and
[2:06:54.160 --> 2:07:00.160]  stop heating our house in the winter and having a sea in the summer and we
[2:07:00.160 --> 2:07:03.520]  should stop eating steak dinners and having barbecues with our neighbors
[2:07:03.520 --> 2:07:07.840]  this is all bad stuff folks this is stuff that's not good
[2:07:07.840 --> 2:07:11.840]  and um you know i think we should just listen to joe biden and the democrat
[2:07:11.840 --> 2:07:14.400]  liberals you guys really got it right don't you
[2:07:14.400 --> 2:07:17.440]  and we should probably when a young when a young boy is born we should probably
[2:07:17.440 --> 2:07:20.320]  just chop his genitals right off right then and there
[2:07:20.320 --> 2:07:23.200]  and when a young girl is born we should probably just give her a mastectomy
[2:07:23.200 --> 2:07:27.600]  right then and there i mean why why why waste time why why why put that off
[2:07:27.600 --> 2:07:32.240]  for five years till the teachers can do it in the classrooms with the kids
[2:07:32.240 --> 2:07:35.920]  and uh i mean really we should probably just take any medical
[2:07:35.920 --> 2:07:39.360]  procedure that the government tells us to without question
[2:07:39.360 --> 2:07:44.480]  our entire lives really i mean that's that's that's what we should probably
[2:07:44.480 --> 2:07:48.320]  be doing right liberals right democrats we've got it all wrong here
[2:07:48.320 --> 2:07:51.280]  guys we've had it all wrong the whole time
[2:07:51.280 --> 2:07:59.200]  freedom is bad truth is bad justice is bad prosperity is bad having fun is bad
[2:07:59.200 --> 2:08:03.760]  eating healthy meals is bad freedom to travel and commerce it's all bad folks
[2:08:03.760 --> 2:08:07.200]  this is all bad the experiment with freedom is obviously failed
[2:08:07.200 --> 2:08:11.040]  liberals are right democrats are right folks freedom has failed us
[2:08:11.040 --> 2:08:17.360]  of course i'm being facetious it's the exact opposite oh
[2:08:17.360 --> 2:08:22.080]  why does america take in more refugees asylum seekers and illegal immigrants
[2:08:22.080 --> 2:08:26.320]  than every other country on earth combined
[2:08:26.320 --> 2:08:32.720]  why would that be not only that america also gives out more welfare and
[2:08:32.720 --> 2:08:36.720]  humanitarian aid to other countries than every
[2:08:36.720 --> 2:08:42.560]  other country on earth combined how could that be possible
[2:08:42.560 --> 2:08:46.880]  how could america give away more than every other country on earth combined
[2:08:46.880 --> 2:08:50.880]  and take in more than every country on earth combined
[2:08:50.880 --> 2:08:58.560]  because freedom worked freedom worked self-government worked
[2:08:58.560 --> 2:09:04.560]  capitalism worked it worked so well that we've been able to take in more people
[2:09:04.560 --> 2:09:07.440]  into our system than everywhere and anywhere else on earth
[2:09:07.440 --> 2:09:11.520]  and we've still been able to give away more than every other country on earth
[2:09:11.520 --> 2:09:17.680]  because freedom worked and now the democrats and liberals
[2:09:17.680 --> 2:09:22.880]  and globalists are trying to destroy it
[2:09:22.880 --> 2:09:31.360]  really amazing stuff we go back now to joe biden who's now hedging on himself
[2:09:31.360 --> 2:09:34.480]  now he this is obviously joe biden's controllers telling him
[2:09:34.480 --> 2:09:38.400]  stop telling people you're running we're not gonna let you run
[2:09:38.400 --> 2:09:41.600]  and so biden just you know naturally thinking of course i'm gonna say i'm
[2:09:41.600 --> 2:09:43.600]  gonna run this is all about showing confidence
[2:09:43.600 --> 2:09:47.280]  yes i'm running because we're doing so great with the economy and we're doing
[2:09:47.280 --> 2:09:50.800]  so great with this and that so of course i'm gonna run i'm a success story
[2:09:50.800 --> 2:09:54.720]  says joe biden but but but that's not what the democrats actually want they
[2:09:54.720 --> 2:10:00.000]  don't want joe biden to run and so he's been told
[2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:03.520]  do not promote that you're running anymore even though he has been
[2:10:03.520 --> 2:10:08.560]  for a year and they filed with the fec
[2:10:08.560 --> 2:10:12.640]  that he's gonna run or with the whatever government entity when you filed to run
[2:10:12.640 --> 2:10:16.000]  for president i forget the name of it but then last night on 60 minutes all
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:20.000]  of a sudden he changes his tune in clip 10
[2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:24.080]  sir are you committed to running again or are there certain
[2:10:24.080 --> 2:10:28.720]  conditions that have to be right look if i were to say to you i'm running again
[2:10:28.720 --> 2:10:31.600]  all of a sudden the whole range of things come into play that i have
[2:10:31.600 --> 2:10:35.120]  requirements i have to change and move and do in terms of election
[2:10:35.120 --> 2:10:38.960]  in terms of election loss then it's much too early to make that kind of
[2:10:38.960 --> 2:10:42.080]  decision now i'm a great pause at your fate
[2:10:42.080 --> 2:10:48.880]  pause it and rewind it briefly this guy is so weird man he's like an animatron
[2:10:48.880 --> 2:10:52.560]  it's just so strange did you see his face that when we just paused there did you
[2:10:52.560 --> 2:10:56.560]  guys notice that he's had so much surgery on his head
[2:10:56.560 --> 2:11:00.240]  and face he's like a robot folks and i get like people think it's fake people
[2:11:00.240 --> 2:11:02.560]  think joe biden's a clone people think he's wearing a prosthetic
[2:11:02.560 --> 2:11:07.280]  mask i get it the guy is so weird and because of
[2:11:07.280 --> 2:11:10.400]  all the surgeries he's had on his face and everything he looks like a damn
[2:11:10.400 --> 2:11:14.000]  robot he looks like jack nicholson is the
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:16.880]  joker
[2:11:16.960 --> 2:11:23.600]  geez anyway he acts like oh it's so unprecedented for a sitting president
[2:11:23.600 --> 2:11:26.880]  to say he's running again it's just impossible you just can't do it i mean
[2:11:26.880 --> 2:11:30.800]  again it's just such blatant lies like like
[2:11:30.800 --> 2:11:34.160]  like that's not been done before like sitting presidents don't announce that
[2:11:34.160 --> 2:11:37.520]  they're running again like trump didn't just do that
[2:11:37.520 --> 2:11:42.000]  like joe biden didn't just do that the entire last year he's been saying he's
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:45.440]  running again now all of a sudden he tells scott pelley oh well i can't say
[2:11:45.440 --> 2:11:48.160]  i'm running again it's just too complicated there's too many legal
[2:11:48.160 --> 2:11:53.040]  issues just just i mean just total lies and he
[2:11:53.040 --> 2:11:55.920]  thinks you're so stupid that you'll believe it
[2:11:55.920 --> 2:11:59.600]  all right go back to the prosthetic faced
[2:11:59.600 --> 2:12:04.480]  uh president boss then it's much too early to make that kind of
[2:12:04.480 --> 2:12:09.040]  decision i'm a great respecter of fate it's already done so what i'm doing is
[2:12:09.040 --> 2:12:12.640]  i'm doing my job i'm going to do that job and within the time frame that makes
[2:12:12.640 --> 2:12:15.840]  sense after this next election cycle here
[2:12:15.840 --> 2:12:19.920]  pause it again pause it again you know it's just
[2:12:19.920 --> 2:12:23.840]  i get frustrated with myself but i have to address
[2:12:23.840 --> 2:12:27.520]  every little lie he tells and that's the problem i could have a five minute clip
[2:12:27.520 --> 2:12:31.760]  of a democrat speaking but i need five hours to break down all the lies
[2:12:31.760 --> 2:12:35.280]  so first he says well you know it's too early to say i'm running again
[2:12:35.280 --> 2:12:39.040]  he's been saying he's running again for a year
[2:12:41.440 --> 2:12:45.120]  it's just it's just unbelievable
[2:12:45.520 --> 2:12:50.800]  guys remind it one more time for me i just get overwhelmed with so many lies
[2:12:50.800 --> 2:12:55.120]  he's told i i've lost track of him on now so okay play it play it again
[2:12:55.120 --> 2:12:59.120]  he should move and do in terms of election in terms of election loss
[2:12:59.120 --> 2:13:02.720]  then it's much too early to make that kind of decision he already did i'm a
[2:13:02.720 --> 2:13:06.480]  great respecter of fate and so what i'm doing is i'm doing my
[2:13:06.480 --> 2:13:09.840]  job i'm doing a job okay pause right time
[2:13:09.840 --> 2:13:16.240]  he's doing his job how many different times now has joe biden said
[2:13:16.240 --> 2:13:20.800]  that he's not in charge four times five times
[2:13:20.800 --> 2:13:23.760]  where he'll be at a press conference he says oh i'm not allowed to take questions
[2:13:23.760 --> 2:13:25.760]  or he'll look around and say what am i supposed to do
[2:13:25.760 --> 2:13:29.280]  he'll say oh they don't want me to do that seven four or five times now
[2:13:29.280 --> 2:13:33.360]  so he's not in charge he's not running the show
[2:13:33.360 --> 2:13:39.120]  everybody knows that and then he goes up there and acts to tell scott
[2:13:39.120 --> 2:13:42.240]  pelle acting like he's in control he's the president he's running things
[2:13:42.240 --> 2:13:47.600]  when he's not he's on vacation 50 of the time finish the clip
[2:13:47.600 --> 2:13:52.480]  makes sense after this next election cycle here going into next year making
[2:13:52.480 --> 2:13:56.560]  judgment on what to do you say that it's much too
[2:13:56.560 --> 2:14:00.560]  early to make that decision i take it the decision has not been made in your
[2:14:00.560 --> 2:14:05.040]  own head look my intentions i said to begin with
[2:14:05.040 --> 2:14:08.000]  is that i would run again but it's just an intention
[2:14:08.000 --> 2:14:13.440]  but is it a firm decision that i've run again that manages to be seen
[2:14:13.440 --> 2:14:18.640]  ah i see so you've already announced you're running again you've already
[2:14:18.640 --> 2:14:22.240]  filed the paperwork to run again standard procedure for a president that
[2:14:22.240 --> 2:14:26.080]  wants to run again totally normal but the democrats don't
[2:14:26.080 --> 2:14:28.800]  want you to run again and you've been such a disaster
[2:14:28.800 --> 2:14:32.080]  that it's bad to say that you're running again ahead of the midterms
[2:14:32.080 --> 2:14:34.960]  so you act like you're not running again even though you admit that you already
[2:14:34.960 --> 2:14:38.960]  made the decision to run again and announced it
[2:14:38.960 --> 2:14:44.560]  i see do you liberal democrat i mean do you enjoy being lied to you so much
[2:14:44.560 --> 2:14:49.360]  it's got to be tough this balancing act this juggling act you do
[2:14:49.360 --> 2:14:52.400]  with all of your lies i mean it's got to be tough
[2:14:52.400 --> 2:14:55.680]  and i understand why no democrats want to debate anymore
[2:14:55.680 --> 2:14:59.120]  it's got to be tough to keep up with all the lies you've told because that's the
[2:14:59.120 --> 2:15:03.200]  thing folks you have to understand anything that comes out of a democrat's
[2:15:03.200 --> 2:15:06.880]  mouth they know that they probably have
[2:15:06.880 --> 2:15:09.840]  said the exact opposite and people can just go back into the internet
[2:15:09.840 --> 2:15:12.800]  archives and find them saying the exact opposite thing
[2:15:12.800 --> 2:15:15.920]  whether it's i mean it was bill clinton that first said make america great
[2:15:15.920 --> 2:15:19.040]  again it was democrats that used to talk about closing the borders
[2:15:19.040 --> 2:15:24.240]  i mean you can just go on and on so
[2:15:24.320 --> 2:15:28.000]  it's hard for democrats to actually speak publicly because they know that
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:30.960]  they've probably said the exact opposite at some point in their career in the
[2:15:30.960 --> 2:15:35.600]  in the past so i just it's got to be hard to be a liberal democrat i mean
[2:15:35.600 --> 2:15:40.240]  to just balance all the lies and juggle all the lies knowing that anything you
[2:15:40.240 --> 2:15:42.800]  might say you've probably said or believed the
[2:15:42.800 --> 2:15:47.920]  exact opposite in the past it's it's it's it's got to be a chore
[2:15:47.920 --> 2:15:52.480]  and it's a chore that uh the chore i'll never have to experience because i'm
[2:15:52.480 --> 2:15:55.040]  certainly not a conformist communist liberal democrat
[2:15:55.040 --> 2:15:58.880]  i don't know why anybody would be everybody knows that high quality
[2:15:58.880 --> 2:16:03.360]  fish oil does fantastic things for your cardiovascular system
[2:16:03.360 --> 2:16:07.680]  for your brain for every part of your body but what i don't see being
[2:16:07.680 --> 2:16:12.400]  promoted is the fact that it has natural
[2:16:12.400 --> 2:16:15.680]  psychotropic effects it certainly does for me
[2:16:15.680 --> 2:16:18.640]  when i take a couple of these capsules an hour before bed
[2:16:18.640 --> 2:16:24.000]  my sleep my dreams are amazing now there are actually some studies out there
[2:16:24.000 --> 2:16:27.520]  linking it to amazing events in the brain

[2:20:48.080 --> 2:20:50.960]  which uh i know there's one around here somewhere i could show it off for the
[2:20:50.960 --> 2:20:55.200]  camera but i am a user of the supplements at
[2:20:55.200 --> 2:20:58.720]  infowarsstore.com and for somebody that lives a
[2:20:58.720 --> 2:21:02.400]  let's call it a high intensity high impact life where i'm just constantly on
[2:21:02.400 --> 2:21:06.400]  the go sometimes it's hard to have a
[2:21:06.400 --> 2:21:09.600]  good diet where you know you're getting all the vitamins minerals nutrients
[2:21:09.600 --> 2:21:13.440]  you need and that's why i supplement so often and so
[2:21:13.440 --> 2:21:16.480]  i was talking to the crew because i'm sure this is the way with a lot of people
[2:21:16.480 --> 2:21:20.000]  whenever there's a change of the seasons i tend to have i don't know if i would
[2:21:20.000 --> 2:21:23.920]  call it allergies uh but it's referred to as seasonal
[2:21:23.920 --> 2:21:27.120]  distress and i use honestly i used to it would
[2:21:27.120 --> 2:21:30.960]  very rarely if ever happened when i lived in missouri but uh with texas down
[2:21:30.960 --> 2:21:35.200]  here there's a lot more pollen mold cedar and other stuff in the air
[2:21:35.200 --> 2:21:39.680]  so i have uh what what is called seasonal distress
[2:21:39.680 --> 2:21:43.600]  and it's about to change seasons and so i noticed it really started to hit me
[2:21:43.600 --> 2:21:46.240]  at the end of last week and last week and you might be able to kind of hear my
[2:21:46.240 --> 2:21:50.000]  voice is a little different than normally and it sounds normally folks i have to
[2:21:50.000 --> 2:21:54.400]  tell you i i have truly discovered the answer to
[2:21:54.400 --> 2:21:58.240]  dealing with this and and i'm telling you folks give it a
[2:21:58.240 --> 2:22:01.760]  try for yourself if you're somebody that suffers from seasonal
[2:22:01.760 --> 2:22:06.640]  distress at the changing of the seasons and uh there's just some discomfort for
[2:22:06.640 --> 2:22:10.240]  a couple weeks there as you go into the new season
[2:22:10.240 --> 2:22:14.720]  pollen block is an incredible relief factor
[2:22:14.720 --> 2:22:19.120]  and i'm just going to tell you this is not a this is not a be a be all end all
[2:22:19.120 --> 2:22:25.280]  solution but it acts immediately as soon as you take it
[2:22:25.280 --> 2:22:28.800]  whatever seasonal distress it acts immediately you're feeling better and
[2:22:28.800 --> 2:22:33.200]  that there's immediate distress relief it's incredible pollen block
[2:22:33.200 --> 2:22:38.160]  and this has been one that we really struggle to keep on the shelves because
[2:22:38.160 --> 2:22:41.440]  when people that have seasonal distress learn about how effective pollen block
[2:22:41.440 --> 2:22:45.600]  is they go there and buy it in bulk immediately
[2:22:45.600 --> 2:22:49.120]  knowing that the changing of the seasons is ahead and they're going to be stocked up on
[2:22:49.120 --> 2:22:53.520]  pollen block but let me just give you another little hint here now i was i
[2:22:53.520 --> 2:22:56.960]  went to check to see if we have this in stock before doing this plug
[2:22:56.960 --> 2:23:00.880]  because we don't really talk about these things there's so much on infowarstore.com
[2:23:00.880 --> 2:23:03.920]  i mean we don't even mention like 70 percent of the products that we have
[2:23:03.920 --> 2:23:08.080]  at infowarstore.com but one of the one of the things you might
[2:23:08.080 --> 2:23:13.440]  experience when you're having seasonal distress like me is congestion
[2:23:13.440 --> 2:23:17.040]  and the worst time to have congestion if it's not when you're on air and you
[2:23:17.040 --> 2:23:21.600]  need to breathe or exercising it's when you're trying to sleep
[2:23:21.600 --> 2:23:26.320]  for two reasons it's well known that breathing through your nose when
[2:23:26.320 --> 2:23:30.000]  you're sleeping is it's it's it's much better for
[2:23:30.000 --> 2:23:33.440]  your sleep pattern it helps you get the REM sleep and helps you stay asleep and
[2:23:33.440 --> 2:23:35.600]  it's just you want to breathe through your mouth you don't want to breathe
[2:23:35.600 --> 2:23:38.000]  through your uh you don't want to breathe through your mouth you want to
[2:23:38.000 --> 2:23:40.160]  breathe through your nose while you're sleeping in fact some people take their
[2:23:40.160 --> 2:23:44.080]  mouth shut to make sure that they can do this why am i telling you that well
[2:23:44.080 --> 2:23:48.000]  when you have the seasonal distress and you have the congestion
[2:23:48.000 --> 2:23:51.120]  it's impossible to sleep without breathing through your mouth
[2:23:51.120 --> 2:23:54.720]  and it's i mean isn't it obnoxious and annoying
[2:23:54.720 --> 2:24:02.400]  i have the secret to relief here folks eucalyptus oil from infowarstore.com
[2:24:02.400 --> 2:24:06.320]  now you're thinking what it's well known that eucalyptus
[2:24:06.320 --> 2:24:10.080]  eucalyptus helps open up your nasal passageways folks i'm telling you
[2:24:10.080 --> 2:24:14.160]  i went to bed last night and i was so congested i mean
[2:24:14.160 --> 2:24:17.680]  i couldn't breathe through my nose at all like it was it was impossible i
[2:24:17.680 --> 2:24:21.040]  couldn't breathe through my nose and i laid down in bed and i was kind of
[2:24:21.040 --> 2:24:24.320]  tossing and turning and i was like i can't i'm not going to be able to
[2:24:24.320 --> 2:24:28.800]  sleep i can't breathe here and i remembered a
[2:24:28.800 --> 2:24:33.040]  trick that i learned and i just forgot about it but i have the
[2:24:33.040 --> 2:24:36.400]  organic eucalyptus essential oils from infowarstore.com
[2:24:36.400 --> 2:24:40.240]  in my bedroom bathroom because i remember i'd learned this
[2:24:40.240 --> 2:24:45.440]  folks if you're suffering from congestion before you want to go to bed
[2:24:45.440 --> 2:24:49.040]  take the organic eucalyptus oil from infowarstore.com
[2:24:49.040 --> 2:24:52.640]  i i just put a a a a handful of it in my hand
[2:24:52.640 --> 2:24:55.920]  you know just little little little hand puddle we'll call it
[2:24:55.920 --> 2:24:59.760]  and i just rub it i just rub it like this all over my chest
[2:24:59.760 --> 2:25:03.760]  and i mean within minutes i'm breathing again
[2:25:03.760 --> 2:25:09.200]  through my nose and fell right asleep incredible relief
[2:25:09.200 --> 2:25:14.080]  and that is is it not one of the most obnoxious things to try to sleep
[2:25:14.080 --> 2:25:17.600]  when your nose is congested and your nasal passageways are congested is it
[2:25:17.600 --> 2:25:20.720]  is it's one of the hardest things restless sleep you can't get to sleep
[2:25:20.720 --> 2:25:24.160]  it just it sucks so i'm telling you folks
[2:25:24.160 --> 2:25:27.600]  pollen block for instant relief for seasonal distress is the best you're
[2:25:27.600 --> 2:25:30.560]  going to find and if you're and if you're having
[2:25:30.560 --> 2:25:34.560]  trouble with congestion when you go to sleep try the eucalyptus

[2:25:42.640 --> 2:25:49.600]  USDA organic eucalyptus and you just rub it on your chest right before you go
[2:25:49.600 --> 2:25:52.080]  to bed and you will be breathing through your
[2:25:52.080 --> 2:25:59.120]  nose within minutes within minutes i'm telling you guys
[2:25:59.120 --> 2:26:05.440]  this is like we should probably even sell a combo pack
[2:26:05.440 --> 2:26:11.360]  of one of our sleep support formulas with eucalyptus essential oils
[2:26:11.360 --> 2:26:14.640]  because i'm telling you man it just it puts you right to sleep
[2:26:14.640 --> 2:26:19.920]  and i think do we sell lavender too we might sell lavender oil too
[2:26:19.920 --> 2:26:22.960]  while i'm on this plug we're going to do a deep plug here we're going to this is a
[2:26:22.960 --> 2:26:25.280]  deep cut you're going into infowars store
[2:26:25.280 --> 2:26:30.800]  deep cut plugs now lavender also well known to help with sleep folks
[2:26:30.800 --> 2:26:34.400]  if you're somebody like me that has trouble kind of calming down
[2:26:34.400 --> 2:26:39.040]  your mind do we sell lavender guys is it i can't see
[2:26:39.040 --> 2:26:42.400]  the screen's too far away i don't have my other screen on so we might not have it
[2:26:42.400 --> 2:26:45.440]  but we should probably get some of that but we should sell eucalyptus with a
[2:26:45.440 --> 2:26:50.080]  sleep aid because i'm telling you man it it it just helps you so much
[2:26:50.080 --> 2:26:53.920]  open those nasal passageways and just get good breathing as you fall asleep i'd
[2:26:53.920 --> 2:26:58.160]  give it a shot infowarsstore.com and of course it's your support there
[2:26:58.160 --> 2:27:01.840]  that keeps us on the air all right let's quickly
[2:27:01.840 --> 2:27:06.000]  do this before we go to this break joe biden has asked about the situation in
[2:27:06.000 --> 2:27:08.720]  taiwan last night this has been a disaster for the white house
[2:27:08.720 --> 2:27:12.560]  flip-flopping back and forth on their strategy and they had to do it again
[2:27:12.560 --> 2:27:17.040]  after joe biden said this on 60 minutes
[2:27:17.040 --> 2:27:25.520]  13 what should chinese president she know about your commitment to taiwan
[2:27:25.520 --> 2:27:29.360]  we agree with what we signed on to a long time ago
[2:27:29.360 --> 2:27:33.360]  and that there's a one china policy and taiwan makes their own judgments about
[2:27:33.360 --> 2:27:36.480]  their independence we are not moving we're not
[2:27:36.480 --> 2:27:40.560]  encouraging or being independent we're not let that's their decision
[2:27:40.560 --> 2:27:44.560]  but would us forces defend the island yes if in fact there was an
[2:27:44.560 --> 2:27:48.080]  unprecedented attack after our interview of white house
[2:27:48.080 --> 2:27:52.320]  official told us us policy has not changed
[2:27:52.320 --> 2:27:58.640]  officially the us will not say whether american forces would defend taiwan
[2:27:58.640 --> 2:28:02.080]  but the commander-in-chief had a view of his own
[2:28:02.080 --> 2:28:06.480]  so unlike ukraine to be clear sir us forces
[2:28:06.480 --> 2:28:11.440]  us men and women would defend taiwan in the event of a chinese invasion
[2:28:11.440 --> 2:28:16.560]  yes you know it's frustrating that info wars is
[2:28:16.560 --> 2:28:19.920]  the only place that's going to tell you what's going on here
[2:28:19.920 --> 2:28:23.280]  but think about it like this joe biden is not the president folks
[2:28:23.280 --> 2:28:26.480]  when he says something on 60 minutes and then the white house has to correct him
[2:28:26.480 --> 2:28:31.200]  that tells you he's not in charge and so
[2:28:31.200 --> 2:28:35.760]  whatever you might think about the us need to get involved with taiwan
[2:28:35.760 --> 2:28:39.200]  you also need to understand that the us is currently at war with russia folks
[2:28:39.200 --> 2:28:43.520]  in ukraine that's what's going on so what are we about to be
[2:28:43.520 --> 2:28:47.040]  strung out in a war with you a war with russia
[2:28:47.040 --> 2:28:50.080]  and with china and how do you think that's going to go
[2:28:50.080 --> 2:28:56.800]  with the current leadership in our military it's not good news folks
[2:28:56.800 --> 2:29:02.880]  the rage for more than a decade have been concentrated green powders
[2:29:02.880 --> 2:29:06.640]  with wheatgrass and so many other ingredients that are known
[2:29:06.640 --> 2:29:12.560]  to make us healthy to make us vibrant and to defend our immune systems
[2:29:12.560 --> 2:29:16.480]  now over a year and a half ago we came out with a product that was top sourced
[2:29:16.480 --> 2:29:20.960]  top the line as good as going to get but then the supply chain broke down
[2:29:20.960 --> 2:29:23.760]  and it was sold out for more than a year finally
[2:29:23.760 --> 2:29:27.360]  green fiber capsules this big old bottle jam packed

[2:36:01.760 --> 2:36:07.280]  the biden news front big tech ramps up censorship in
[2:36:07.280 --> 2:36:11.280]  wake of biden's white supremacy summit and so uh you know they're gonna do a
[2:36:11.280 --> 2:36:14.720]  whole summit on white people because you know they're
[2:36:14.720 --> 2:36:20.240]  racists and this is already after the fbi whistleblowers
[2:36:20.240 --> 2:36:22.880]  have come forward saying that the fbi's number one
[2:36:22.880 --> 2:36:31.360]  agenda is to get white people so uh yeah trump supporters white people christians
[2:36:31.360 --> 2:36:36.800]  that's objective number one two and three on our corrupt government's list on
[2:36:36.800 --> 2:36:41.760]  our tyrannical fascistic totalitarian government's list
[2:36:41.760 --> 2:36:45.920]  that is controlled by the democrat party right now
[2:36:45.920 --> 2:36:48.800]  and even though there is no white supremacy that's out there
[2:36:48.800 --> 2:36:53.520]  that's a threat to anybody that's their number one concern and so if they can't
[2:36:53.520 --> 2:36:56.480]  find any white supremacists then they'll manufacture
[2:36:56.480 --> 2:37:01.840]  the the cause like jesse smallette or some of these other hate crime
[2:37:01.840 --> 2:37:06.720]  hoaxers that we have out there and they're going to be looking at
[2:37:06.720 --> 2:37:10.640]  your video games dhs to spend almost 700
[2:37:10.640 --> 2:37:16.400]  thousand of taxpayers money on studying extremism in video gaming yes that's
[2:37:16.400 --> 2:37:19.920]  the problem here is people playing video games that's what americans are
[2:37:19.920 --> 2:37:25.280]  threatened by extremism in video gaming because you know
[2:37:25.280 --> 2:37:29.680]  those teenagers playing online might have used a racial slur
[2:37:29.680 --> 2:37:36.320]  ooh look out a teenager playing madden online or
[2:37:36.320 --> 2:37:41.760]  call of duty might have said fag oh my gosh
[2:37:41.760 --> 2:37:46.480]  you know this whole thing is so hilarious to me
[2:37:46.480 --> 2:37:50.800]  because it's it's it's it's treated like a criminal act now
[2:37:50.800 --> 2:37:56.240]  if a white person says the n-word and while
[2:37:56.240 --> 2:38:00.240]  i mean i i think the the the common conclusion to land on here is
[2:38:00.240 --> 2:38:04.320]  we believe in free speech there's all kinds of offensive words out there that
[2:38:04.320 --> 2:38:07.600]  if you run around saying people aren't gonna like you and might be fighting
[2:38:07.600 --> 2:38:12.640]  words and so you you you can choose whether you want to say that or not
[2:38:12.640 --> 2:38:15.520]  you can choose whether you want to be portrayed as a jerk or not
[2:38:15.520 --> 2:38:20.720]  whatever the context may be but i find it hilarious
[2:38:20.720 --> 2:38:24.080]  for example perhaps the greatest example even
[2:38:24.080 --> 2:38:29.200]  is you had the duke volleyball player a black girl who played volleyball for
[2:38:29.200 --> 2:38:32.800]  duke make up a story claiming that she was called the n-word
[2:38:32.800 --> 2:38:36.560]  never happened they reviewed all the private footage from that day with
[2:38:36.560 --> 2:38:39.680]  people recording on their phones and cam cameras
[2:38:39.680 --> 2:38:43.920]  they reviewed their own security footage they reviewed the television
[2:38:43.920 --> 2:38:46.640]  footage they they asked eyewitnesses i mean they
[2:38:46.640 --> 2:38:51.040]  did a full examination into this duke volleyball players
[2:38:51.040 --> 2:38:54.560]  claims that somebody called her an n-word i mean they did a full examination
[2:38:54.560 --> 2:38:58.960]  never happened never happened the girl made it up
[2:38:58.960 --> 2:39:04.880]  but okay let's let's say someone did call her the n-word let's say
[2:39:04.880 --> 2:39:08.880]  someone said the n-word and uh and and this girl heard it
[2:39:08.880 --> 2:39:13.680]  stop acting like that offended you
[2:39:13.680 --> 2:39:18.400]  stop it if you're gonna complain about people using the n-word let's talk
[2:39:18.400 --> 2:39:24.160]  about the rap music industry shall we or or you know what forget about
[2:39:24.160 --> 2:39:26.880]  rap forget about people that use the n-word in
[2:39:26.880 --> 2:39:32.400]  movies and music forget about that let's just talk about sports
[2:39:32.400 --> 2:39:39.680]  you ever been on a basketball court you ever been on a football field
[2:39:39.680 --> 2:39:43.440]  i would argue that the n-word might be used
[2:39:43.440 --> 2:39:50.240]  more than any other word now do you hear any complaining about that
[2:39:50.240 --> 2:39:55.520]  is anybody raising ire about this racist word and it being used on sporting
[2:39:55.520 --> 2:40:01.120]  fields is anybody complained about that i'm not aware of it
[2:40:01.120 --> 2:40:04.960]  folks i've been on football fields from high school
[2:40:04.960 --> 2:40:11.360]  to the pro level on the field during games you know they're dropping in bombs
[2:40:11.360 --> 2:40:15.440]  kevin garnett used to run up and down the nba floor
[2:40:15.440 --> 2:40:20.800]  shouting the n-word it's well known
[2:40:22.000 --> 2:40:24.560]  in fact
[2:40:24.880 --> 2:40:30.080]  kevin garnett was openly anti-white it racist against white people in the
[2:40:30.080 --> 2:40:33.680]  basketball court now do i think kevin garnett is a racist because he says this
[2:40:33.680 --> 2:40:36.480]  crap on the basketball court i don't know he's an athlete maybe it's an
[2:40:36.480 --> 2:40:39.200]  intimidation thing he's in the zone i don't really care i'm not i don't have
[2:40:39.200 --> 2:40:41.760]  any problem with whatever kevin garnett has to say
[2:40:41.760 --> 2:40:47.760]  doesn't bother me i think it's hilarious
[2:40:47.760 --> 2:40:52.880]  to have a huge story about the n-word potentially being used at a sporting
[2:40:52.880 --> 2:40:57.280]  event when it wasn't used when you can tune in to any other sporting event
[2:40:57.280 --> 2:41:01.440]  and it's the number one used word i mean they have these they have these pair
[2:41:01.440 --> 2:41:06.000]  ab mics at sporting events to pick up long range
[2:41:06.000 --> 2:41:09.440]  sound and if you're listening to the game sometimes they have a dump on it
[2:41:09.440 --> 2:41:12.400]  and you may they've picked up on it now when they really started
[2:41:12.400 --> 2:41:15.440]  introducing this a couple years ago on television
[2:41:15.440 --> 2:41:19.920]  and sometimes you'll hear like you know the crowd chatter or the vocal chatter
[2:41:19.920 --> 2:41:22.080]  on the field and then all the sudden it'll go silent
[2:41:22.080 --> 2:41:26.560]  you know why that is it's because they're cursing and saying the n-word
[2:41:26.560 --> 2:41:30.160]  and they used to not have that sound on a different line it used to be on the same
[2:41:30.160 --> 2:41:32.880]  line and they couldn't black it out without cutting off their own
[2:41:32.880 --> 2:41:36.720]  their own commentary so they put it on a different line now so they can cut that
[2:41:36.720 --> 2:41:38.960]  out so when they first introduced that about
[2:41:38.960 --> 2:41:41.280]  five years ago folks you watch a basketball game you watch a football
[2:41:41.280 --> 2:41:45.600]  game you're hearing n-bombs left and right nobody complained nobody said racism
[2:41:45.600 --> 2:41:49.760]  nobody had an investigation nobody wanted to know who said it
[2:41:49.760 --> 2:41:53.360]  but then one girl makes up that she's the victim somebody said it
[2:41:53.360 --> 2:41:57.920]  whole investigation into it never got said and it's like a huge story
[2:41:57.920 --> 2:42:02.800]  it's just more clown world stuff but hey
[2:42:02.800 --> 2:42:09.440]  yeah look at this it's not that hard to find Kevin Garnett using the n-word
[2:42:09.440 --> 2:42:14.000]  it's who cares man get offended don't get offended say it don't say it
[2:42:14.000 --> 2:42:17.680]  what i mean let's just stop it's just it's an
[2:42:17.680 --> 2:42:22.000]  unequal application of outrage is what it is and that's again if it can't be
[2:42:22.000 --> 2:42:25.040]  applied universally it's not logic it's it's propaganda
[2:42:25.040 --> 2:42:28.480]  so so all this complaining of the n-word is just more anti-white propaganda
[2:42:28.480 --> 2:42:32.480]  but oh the fbi is looking for white supremacists everywhere they can't
[2:42:32.480 --> 2:42:35.840]  find them but meanwhile new orleans becomes the
[2:42:35.840 --> 2:42:40.400]  murder capital of america mostly mostly black people getting
[2:42:40.400 --> 2:42:44.480]  killed by their black people no investigation there
[2:42:44.480 --> 2:42:48.320]  new orleans mayor says 30 000 and taxpayer funded
[2:42:48.320 --> 2:42:51.840]  flights to europe was for her safety as a black woman because you know her city

[2:47:33.280 --> 2:47:37.680]  going to air about half of it right here on the alex
[2:47:37.680 --> 2:47:42.320]  jones show ahead of jerald solente taking over the fourth hour
[2:47:42.320 --> 2:47:45.760]  and then i will be back hosting the war room three to six p.m
[2:47:45.760 --> 2:47:49.200]  central time at bandot video covering the rest of the news i didn't get to
[2:47:49.200 --> 2:47:52.080]  today going to be a very news heavy broadcast perhaps we'll take some calls
[2:47:52.080 --> 2:47:55.680]  but in the meantime before jerald solente takes over
[2:47:55.680 --> 2:48:00.800]  here is david eich this weekend in london
[2:48:02.640 --> 2:48:09.840]  well well bloody well how appropriate how out
[2:48:09.840 --> 2:48:18.080]  that we should stand here today next to the bank of england
[2:48:18.080 --> 2:48:25.760]  in one of the global bellies of the beast the city of london financial
[2:48:25.760 --> 2:48:32.400]  district the square mile yes and how how apt
[2:48:32.400 --> 2:48:41.440]  to that we gather here today in this belly of the beast
[2:48:41.440 --> 2:48:48.800]  while in other parts of this city millions come together to pay
[2:48:48.800 --> 2:48:55.840]  homage and a result of very simple of their oppression
[2:48:55.840 --> 2:49:01.280]  and enslavement
[2:49:02.000 --> 2:49:08.480]  and that's what i want to emphasize today where all this is actually coming
[2:49:08.480 --> 2:49:14.640]  from where covid came from the jab came from human
[2:49:14.640 --> 2:49:21.440]  cause global warming nonsense has come from the ukraine narrative
[2:49:21.440 --> 2:49:30.880]  and now the eulogization by so many millions of a royal family that
[2:49:30.880 --> 2:49:37.840]  is the head of state only because of who had sex with who within one family
[2:49:37.840 --> 2:49:45.040]  it is nonsensical it is a expression of the very hierarchy
[2:49:45.040 --> 2:49:50.960]  so run from places like this that has helped humanity in
[2:49:50.960 --> 2:49:59.520]  servitude for known human history of course
[2:49:59.520 --> 2:50:06.400]  of course the demonic faces on these banners
[2:50:06.400 --> 2:50:16.880]  must face justice for their mega crimes against humanity
[2:50:16.880 --> 2:50:22.640]  and we must not rest until they do so
[2:50:22.640 --> 2:50:29.120]  hancock witty are all of them yes
[2:50:29.120 --> 2:50:43.120]  midasalam mat hancock still at large a man who oversaw the mass murder
[2:50:43.120 --> 2:50:50.080]  of the elderly in the spring of 2020 with an end-of-life drug called
[2:50:50.080 --> 2:50:56.880]  midasalam who then called it the first wave of covid
[2:50:56.880 --> 2:51:08.320]  when it was the first wave of democide murder mass murder by the state
[2:51:08.320 --> 2:51:15.760]  hancock witty valance javid johnson phantom
[2:51:15.760 --> 2:51:23.120]  yes they must face the consequences for their actions but it goes much bigger
[2:51:23.120 --> 2:51:29.760]  than them they are not the architects of mass murder and mass control they are
[2:51:29.760 --> 2:51:36.480]  the gophers the agents the accomplices of something much greater
[2:51:36.480 --> 2:51:41.920]  that hides in the shadows in places like this the square mile
[2:51:41.920 --> 2:51:54.800]  run by secret societies of pure bloody evil
[2:51:54.800 --> 2:52:02.560]  and i say this to the police forces of these lands
[2:52:02.560 --> 2:52:09.680]  it is to your to your shame in extremis
[2:52:09.680 --> 2:52:15.200]  that you have stood by and continue to stand by
[2:52:15.200 --> 2:52:22.000]  while your fellow humans are murdered and not only that
[2:52:22.000 --> 2:52:31.120]  not only that you then protect and
[2:52:31.120 --> 2:52:38.080]  keep from justice the very people who are doing
[2:52:38.080 --> 2:52:42.960]  the murdering while at the same time you abuse
[2:52:42.960 --> 2:52:49.680]  seek to silence and marginalize those with the moral courage
[2:52:49.680 --> 2:52:57.200]  and the awareness to challenge the murder and expose the murder
[2:52:57.200 --> 2:53:05.280]  you you in uniform are not there primarily
[2:53:05.280 --> 2:53:09.600]  to protect the people that is a myth
[2:53:09.600 --> 2:53:17.760]  you are there to protect those from whom the people need protecting
[2:53:17.760 --> 2:53:22.640]  your own courage where is your self respect
[2:53:22.640 --> 2:53:28.640]  where is your awareness of what you do
[2:53:28.640 --> 2:53:41.360]  but but we can talk about the oil rags of this tyranny
[2:53:41.360 --> 2:53:49.520]  we must never forget the engineers because like i say
[2:53:49.520 --> 2:53:56.800]  these people even swab and gates higher up the hierarchy as they may be
[2:53:56.800 --> 2:54:04.400]  are still gophers for a force a network that spans the world
[2:54:04.400 --> 2:54:09.680]  and works through apparently individual governments
[2:54:09.680 --> 2:54:16.160]  to the same sinister satanic end and places like this
[2:54:16.160 --> 2:54:23.280]  is where they operate from the plan is this which is why
[2:54:23.280 --> 2:54:27.520]  we must yes focus on the gophers and the oil rags
[2:54:27.520 --> 2:54:32.320]  for their part in this but we must not lose sight
[2:54:32.320 --> 2:54:40.240]  of where it's coming from because the plan is to create the unfolding
[2:54:40.240 --> 2:54:45.680]  catastrophe for humanity that's happening all over the world and
[2:54:45.680 --> 2:54:50.320]  this winter we see nothing yet with the energy prices
[2:54:50.320 --> 2:54:53.920]  where people on fixed incomes and no incomes
[2:54:53.920 --> 2:54:58.080]  will have to choose between food and warmth
[2:54:58.080 --> 2:55:04.400]  i wonder if charlie boy will be doing that
[2:55:04.400 --> 2:55:11.200]  so the idea as it started with lockdown and continues now with the
[2:55:11.200 --> 2:55:17.040]  destruction of the economy through the massive increases in
[2:55:17.040 --> 2:55:22.640]  energy and fuel the idea is for people in individual
[2:55:22.640 --> 2:55:27.120]  countries quote to blame their governments
[2:55:27.120 --> 2:55:32.080]  and their cult gophers in government for everything
[2:55:32.080 --> 2:55:38.720]  because the idea then is having dismantled our lives and our ability
[2:55:38.720 --> 2:55:43.280]  to put food on the table and warmth in our homes
[2:55:43.280 --> 2:55:49.120]  that the other level of the cult via its corporations
[2:55:49.120 --> 2:55:56.800]  its banks yes and its politicians
[2:55:56.800 --> 2:56:00.560]  political people who are controlled by them
[2:56:00.560 --> 2:56:07.600]  to come forward and say look at the mess that governments
[2:56:07.600 --> 2:56:15.680]  have made of your lives but we are now going to step forward
[2:56:15.680 --> 2:56:20.160]  with the corporations the banks the billionaires of the cult
[2:56:20.160 --> 2:56:26.000]  to save you from what your governments have imposed upon you
[2:56:26.000 --> 2:56:30.400]  when those same people from the background
[2:56:30.400 --> 2:56:35.120]  have been orchestrating the catastrophe
[2:56:35.120 --> 2:56:41.760]  via those governments and gophers in government it is a
[2:56:41.760 --> 2:56:47.280]  mind trick that they are seeking to play it's in their bloody documents
[2:56:47.280 --> 2:56:53.120]  and we mustn't buy it we must see the gopher's responsibility
[2:56:53.120 --> 2:56:58.880]  but we must also see where it is coming from
[2:56:58.880 --> 2:57:04.320]  and so yes they must face the consequences
[2:57:04.320 --> 2:57:09.600]  but we must understand the game that is playing us
[2:57:09.600 --> 2:57:14.080]  and cease to take part and there's another
[2:57:14.080 --> 2:57:21.760]  mind trick that we must always be aware of and that is
[2:57:21.760 --> 2:57:30.080]  that we are manipulated in our anger in our fury of what is being done
[2:57:30.080 --> 2:57:39.360]  to become what we oppose what we fight we become
[2:57:39.360 --> 2:57:47.200]  the world over the history over you see the evidence
[2:57:47.200 --> 2:57:50.960]  info wars work has never been having a bigger effect than it's having right

[3:02:35.840 --> 3:02:39.520]  hours the reduced benefits the end of overtime and the vanishing pension that
[3:02:39.520 --> 3:02:41.840]  disappears the minute you go to collect it and now

[3:05:06.640 --> 3:05:09.440]  best coffee in the world that's wild harvested
[3:05:09.440 --> 3:05:13.520]  above organic in the volcanic soil better than watermelon coffee and yeah
[3:05:13.520 --> 3:05:16.640]  we buy it from the little farmers that you know the media calls communists but
[3:05:16.640 --> 3:05:19.520]  really they're just a commune and whatever the point is is that it's good
[3:05:19.520 --> 3:05:22.640]  coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican government take
[3:05:22.640 --> 3:05:25.280]  over so i actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and i've been buying it
[3:05:25.280 --> 3:05:28.320]  for what 14 years and the price has never gone up the same stuff sold at
