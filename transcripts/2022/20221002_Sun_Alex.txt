[00:00.000 --> 00:10.400]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[00:10.400 --> 00:17.440]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:17.440 --> 00:47.360]  Tonight a heartbroken mother telling us her teenage son died after a knowingly
[00:47.360 --> 00:49.560]  taking a lethal dose of fentanyl.
[00:49.560 --> 00:55.680]  The Georgia Department of Health now warning that 66 people in Georgia have overdosed on
[00:55.680 --> 00:59.280]  the drug in the last month alone, the youngest only 10 years of age.
[00:59.280 --> 01:06.320]  The 72,000 Americans last year who died from fentanyl poisoning, that's more than the entirety
[01:06.320 --> 01:09.840]  of Vietnam, the entire Vietnam War.
[01:09.840 --> 01:13.920]  Migrant children pouring into our area on flights chartered by the feds.
[01:13.920 --> 01:17.560]  Former West Chester County executive Rob Astorino says that's what you're seeing on
[01:17.560 --> 01:22.880]  this video from a distance at West Chester County airport and he says the number of flights
[01:22.880 --> 01:23.880]  is increasing.
[01:23.880 --> 01:30.520]  We have no answers about basic questions like who's coming here, where are they being settled
[01:30.520 --> 01:32.600]  or taken to.
[01:32.600 --> 01:37.080]  The News4Jaxi team is digging into claims that the federal government is flying illegal
[01:37.080 --> 01:41.880]  immigrants into Jacksonville in the dark of night as the Biden administration tries to
[01:41.880 --> 01:47.120]  handle the flood of people crossing into the U.S. along the southern border.
[01:47.120 --> 01:49.680]  But I see the arrogance.
[01:49.680 --> 01:57.640]  As we understand it, 48 migrants were lured, I will use the word lured, under false pretenses.
[01:57.640 --> 02:03.960]  They were taken to Martha's Vineyard from what we can gather for nothing, for little
[02:03.960 --> 02:11.040]  more than a photo op, video op, and then they were unceremoniously stranded in Martha's
[02:11.040 --> 02:12.040]  Vineyard.
[02:12.040 --> 02:16.240]  As far as the border, we're taking unprecedented action.
[02:16.240 --> 02:21.520]  We had to fix something that was broken, especially by the last administration.
[02:21.520 --> 02:23.080]  We've secured record levels.
[02:23.080 --> 02:29.560]  This is what we have been able to do, a funding for the Department of Homeland Security.
[02:29.560 --> 02:35.880]  Doing it for the sake of a headline, what we're seeing with these governors is irresponsible
[02:35.880 --> 02:36.880]  and it's inhumane.
[02:36.880 --> 02:37.880]  It's inhumane.
[02:37.880 --> 02:45.640]  And the evil, Biden and the Democrats, you tell me, look at their faces.
[02:45.640 --> 02:52.320]  You tell me which one of these 20%, 20 to 40% of these children are going to go missing.
[02:52.320 --> 02:53.320]  And the corruption.
[02:53.320 --> 02:55.120]  Well, think about this, okay?
[02:55.120 --> 02:58.600]  People came into this country illegally violating our laws, okay?
[02:58.600 --> 03:03.480]  And the first thing they do is get lawyers and use our laws to sue an elected governor,
[03:03.480 --> 03:04.920]  to sue a state.
[03:04.920 --> 03:11.720]  And we have a shortage of workers in our country and you see even in Florida, some of the farmers
[03:11.720 --> 03:18.320]  and the growers saying, why are you shipping these immigrants up north?
[03:18.320 --> 03:21.920]  We need them to pick the crops down here.
[03:21.920 --> 03:24.400]  And there's really not even words to describe it.
[03:24.400 --> 03:29.960]  The Democratic Party working for the UN and the globalist does a worldwide lockdown, opens
[03:29.960 --> 03:34.960]  the borders, floods us with tens of millions of people and then the Republicans ship 50
[03:34.960 --> 03:39.960]  people to the Naval Observatory in D.C. where the Vice President Puppet lives, Kamala Harris.
[03:39.960 --> 03:45.560]  And they ship 48 people to Martha's Vineyard and they ship a few thousand to Chicago and
[03:45.560 --> 03:49.480]  they literally call it human trafficking and they call it illegal when they're the ones
[03:49.480 --> 03:50.480]  running and all.
[03:50.480 --> 03:57.560]  It's just so insane to watch them say, we are so enriched by the 48 illegal aliens that
[03:57.560 --> 03:59.240]  came here in Martha's Vineyard.
[03:59.240 --> 04:04.480]  But we shipped them all away and to see gushing articles how good the left is and how wonderful
[04:04.480 --> 04:09.280]  they are and to see Twitter leftists celebrating how they love migrants when they're the first
[04:09.280 --> 04:13.400]  people that don't want any of these folks around them.
[04:13.400 --> 04:15.400]  It is just incredible.
[04:15.400 --> 04:20.320]  When we're there over the last few years showing children being handed to random men to be
[04:20.320 --> 04:26.880]  put in vans and driven to God knows where, true human smuggling, the left loves it.
[04:26.880 --> 04:27.880]  They cover it up.
[04:27.880 --> 04:30.600]  You know, Jones staged that footage of kids being loaded in the van.
[04:30.600 --> 04:31.600]  No, it was real.
[04:31.600 --> 04:35.280]  But then when they do it, it's a good thing.
[04:35.280 --> 04:39.760]  And then when Republicans just take a few people that were already vetted and released
[04:39.760 --> 04:45.680]  about to be flown to Florida and when the states fly that up, when the states do that,
[04:45.680 --> 04:47.360]  they totally freak out.
[04:47.360 --> 04:56.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Sunday, October 2nd, 2022.
[04:56.280 --> 05:01.360]  Get ready for a very important broadcast.
[05:01.360 --> 05:06.160]  Think about a world without Infowars.
[05:06.160 --> 05:10.480]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers
[05:10.480 --> 05:15.800]  and stories we've broken together, this family that is Infowars.
[05:15.800 --> 05:21.120]  Think about how Infowars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other
[05:21.120 --> 05:28.680]  foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main
[05:28.680 --> 05:31.880]  base to defeat the New World Order.
[05:31.880 --> 05:37.640]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners
[05:37.640 --> 05:42.120]  of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[05:42.120 --> 05:43.880]  I don't take the credit.
[05:43.880 --> 05:45.720]  I give you the credit.
[05:45.720 --> 05:48.120]  And now Infowars is facing its darkest hours.
[05:48.120 --> 05:50.120]  It isn't going to give up.
[05:50.120 --> 05:51.840]  Without your support, we can be shut down.
[05:51.840 --> 05:55.280]  Please go to SaveInfoWars.com today.
[05:55.280 --> 06:19.120]  SaveInfoWars.com today and donate for our legal defense fund.
[06:19.120 --> 06:26.280]  Sunday, October 2nd, 2022, I'm your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from the embattled
[06:26.280 --> 06:31.560]  Infowars Studios, even the heart of Texas, Austin, broadcasting worldwide.
[06:31.560 --> 06:36.240]  We have another incredibly important broadcast lined up for you tonight.
[06:36.240 --> 06:41.480]  Larry Pinkney, it was a founding member of the original Black Panther Party and was a
[06:41.480 --> 06:42.480]  political president.
[06:42.480 --> 06:46.120]  He's one of the smartest people I know, not just on race relations, but on the New World
[06:46.120 --> 06:47.120]  Order itself.
[06:47.120 --> 06:53.760]  He's one of the first US citizens to successfully even petition the United Nations decades ago.
[06:53.760 --> 06:59.760]  He will be joining us coming up in the second hour to talk about the attempts to create
[06:59.760 --> 07:05.040]  race war in this country and the fact we're already in a staged, soft form of it that's
[07:05.040 --> 07:07.440]  becoming more intense by the day.
[07:07.440 --> 07:13.120]  In the meantime, as negative as all this news is, whether you're in Canada or whether you're
[07:13.120 --> 07:17.960]  in Sweden or whether you're in Brazil or whether you're in Italy or dozens of other
[07:17.960 --> 07:26.000]  countries, in every case, nationalist, populist, anti-New World Order, anti-Claus Schwab, Bill
[07:26.000 --> 07:33.400]  Gates, patriots are being elected to the legislatures, the state houses, the Congresses, the parliaments,
[07:33.400 --> 07:36.040]  and as presidents and as prime ministers.
[07:36.040 --> 07:41.040]  And despite all the threats and all the violence and all the attacks, Bolsonaro, as voting
[07:41.040 --> 07:46.520]  started this morning, is tracking to win big re-election in Brazil.
[07:46.520 --> 07:51.240]  And let me tell you, there's arguments on whether DeSantis is better than Trump.
[07:51.240 --> 07:53.840]  But DeSantis never had a chance to be president yet, so we don't know.
[07:53.840 --> 07:56.200]  I think Trump's good overall, so is DeSantis.
[07:56.200 --> 08:01.320]  But Bolsonaro is the SH-T.
[08:01.320 --> 08:09.960]  He is the real deal, the badass, the patriot, the model, the platinum standard.
[08:09.960 --> 08:12.880]  And so we hope and pray that they're unable to steal the election.
[08:12.880 --> 08:13.880]  Massive threats.
[08:13.880 --> 08:19.120]  He's been stabbed with a 10-inch butcher knife into his liver, spleen and kidneys, and survived.
[08:19.120 --> 08:21.880]  They've been trying to kill him ever since.
[08:21.880 --> 08:27.240]  But he's been riding around at the front of 5 million people all over Brazil on a motorcycle.
[08:27.240 --> 08:30.280]  So definitely not afraid, leading from the front.
[08:30.280 --> 08:32.680]  They've been shooting, bombing, killing.
[08:32.680 --> 08:36.120]  In an escalation, the last few months, ahead of the election, the Communist tab, he's running
[08:36.120 --> 08:38.000]  against an open communist.
[08:38.000 --> 08:42.040]  He even goes on stage in red jumpsuits.
[08:42.040 --> 08:45.480]  So that's what Brazil is facing.
[08:45.480 --> 08:51.360]  So we're all with Bolsonaro and the Brazilian people tonight, just like we're with Georgia
[08:51.360 --> 08:54.800]  Maloney and what's happening in Italy as well.
[08:54.800 --> 08:57.520]  But humanity is on the march.
[08:57.520 --> 09:04.800]  The globalist New World Order is on the run, ladies and gentlemen.
[09:04.800 --> 09:08.120]  And here's the good news for our head, all the bad news, because you know the bad news,
[09:08.120 --> 09:11.840]  we can get ahead of it and understand what's happening.
[09:11.840 --> 09:16.240]  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the UN, the IMF, the World Bank, the CIA, the FBI,
[09:16.240 --> 09:21.280]  the New World Order, every one of their organizations are running around like chicken little sand,
[09:21.280 --> 09:26.280]  the sky's falling on them because it is falling on them everywhere.
[09:26.280 --> 09:29.800]  The public's figuring it out at a rapid rate and turning against them.
[09:29.800 --> 09:36.680]  So I would estimate in most Western countries 30% know about the New World Order now.
[09:36.680 --> 09:39.560]  10 years ago it was 2%.
[09:39.560 --> 09:43.080]  And the wake-up rate so fast in six months it'll be 50%.
[09:43.080 --> 09:48.080]  And then, ladies and gentlemen, game over, unless they have a giant nuclear war to reset
[09:48.080 --> 09:52.320]  everything, that's why they're calling it the Great Reset, the economic collapse, the
[09:52.320 --> 09:57.040]  collapsing borders, the devalued currencies, the inflation, all of it is to create a crisis
[09:57.040 --> 09:59.400]  so bad.
[09:59.400 --> 10:04.040]  You forget about politics and submit to going to universal basic income, global welfare,
[10:04.040 --> 10:08.720]  but they can only carry this out if you don't know it's them that's doing it.
[10:08.720 --> 10:10.880]  That's why we're in a total race to expose them.
[10:10.880 --> 10:14.240]  And I'm going to give the viewers the good news.
[10:14.240 --> 10:17.200]  I don't just come up here and try to make this show entertaining or interesting.
[10:17.200 --> 10:21.640]  I can make it a lot more entertaining, a lot more interesting, and just show you crazy
[10:21.640 --> 10:24.640]  videos all day.
[10:24.640 --> 10:30.920]  That's escapism or kind of fake red meat, mainline conservative TV and radio.
[10:30.920 --> 10:31.920]  We don't do that.
[10:31.920 --> 10:36.320]  We have a pro-human, unifying, populist message.
[10:36.320 --> 10:41.600]  And I can tell you our message, the message you've backed, is now the operating system
[10:41.600 --> 10:46.920]  of the main resistance in Europe, the UK, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, Asia,
[10:46.920 --> 10:48.200]  Russia, you name it.
[10:48.200 --> 10:56.800]  We are number one and we have absolutely dominated and slaughtered the enemy politically, intellectually,
[10:56.800 --> 10:57.800]  culturally.
[10:57.800 --> 11:03.400]  We have blown them to bits in a nonviolent fashion.
[11:03.400 --> 11:11.160]  That's why there's thousands of articles a week and thousands, become a local TV station,
[11:11.160 --> 11:15.720]  thousands a week of TV stations attacking your Australian line about me.
[11:15.720 --> 11:20.480]  And so I am very honored to be lied about, I am very honored to be demonized, I am extremely
[11:20.480 --> 11:22.480]  honored to be over the target.
[11:22.480 --> 11:24.920]  I just want to stand the fight and I salute you for that.
[11:24.920 --> 11:29.320]  Now let's talk more about the enemy running around very afraid.
[11:29.320 --> 11:32.440]  I have more than five clips and I'm not going to play them all the day because the time
[11:32.440 --> 11:36.000]  is strange, but I'm going to get to a few of them.
[11:36.000 --> 11:39.480]  We have the UN officially saying they need to censor everybody.
[11:39.480 --> 11:42.320]  We have the WEF saying they officially need to censor everybody.
[11:42.320 --> 11:47.720]  We have Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation saying they got to censor everybody, just on Friday.
[11:47.720 --> 11:53.400]  We have major governments saying it and they're hitting the panic button saying we're losing.
[11:53.400 --> 11:56.320]  We've got to shut these populists down.
[11:56.320 --> 12:03.280]  We got to silence A-L-E-X-J-O-N-E-S and look, I'm going to take these folks on to be demonized
[12:03.280 --> 12:07.080]  and attacked and they end probably destroyed.
[12:07.080 --> 12:11.520]  I'm happy to do it, ladies and gentlemen, as long as we win and so it's a very bitter
[12:11.520 --> 12:15.640]  sweet for me, but I just want to tell everybody it's not like we're fighting because it's
[12:15.640 --> 12:16.640]  the right thing to do.
[12:16.640 --> 12:17.640]  We're doing that.
[12:17.640 --> 12:22.640]  It's not like we're fighting when we have no chance of winning.
[12:22.640 --> 12:25.720]  As Churchill said, there are many times in history when you can fight and be assured
[12:25.720 --> 12:26.920]  to win.
[12:26.920 --> 12:30.040]  There are other times when you're not sure you can win, but it's the right thing to do.
[12:30.040 --> 12:33.400]  And there are times when you're going to lose, but it's better to live on your feet than
[12:33.400 --> 12:40.080]  die on your knees as a slave or die on your feet and then I guess live on your knees.
[12:40.080 --> 12:41.800]  I don't think that's how the universe works.
[12:41.800 --> 12:45.800]  I don't disagree with Zapata's statement of, I'd rather die on my feet than be a slave
[12:45.800 --> 12:50.880]  on my knees, but you actually live on your feet, you die a thousand deaths living on
[12:50.880 --> 12:51.880]  your knees.
[12:51.880 --> 12:57.320]  And so I have all these global organizations in full panic mode.
[12:57.320 --> 13:06.520]  You have them in full panic mode, but still they're full of hutzpah and bravada and arrogance
[13:06.520 --> 13:11.520]  and just intense, tuberous.
[13:11.520 --> 13:16.760]  They're so imperious, making statements like this the first clip we're going to play.
[13:16.760 --> 13:18.160]  We own the science.
[13:18.160 --> 13:19.800]  That's a quote.
[13:19.800 --> 13:25.120]  Really science is about challenging and questioning and new research and new ideas and what we
[13:25.120 --> 13:28.640]  thought was settled science a decade later always has changed.
[13:28.640 --> 13:32.680]  But no, no, no, we own the science.
[13:32.680 --> 13:37.320]  That's the U.N. information head that's merged with the W.E.F. hiring was a hundred thousand
[13:37.320 --> 13:39.960]  now it's a million fact checkers and sensors.
[13:39.960 --> 13:43.680]  That's the U.N. interfacing with big tech sensors you.
[13:43.680 --> 13:46.840]  She says we own the science.
[13:46.840 --> 13:50.560]  Well what a preposterous cult like statement in and of itself.
[13:50.560 --> 14:00.040]  Then she thanks Google for helping censor the last two and a half years that hydroxychloroquine
[14:00.040 --> 14:11.960]  or that Regeneron or that ivermectin in all the major studies had massive effects on COVID-19
[14:11.960 --> 14:16.200]  or that they censored it came out of a lab now they admit it did or they censored that
[14:16.200 --> 14:19.880]  Fauci and Bill Gates funded it which they now admit they did or that the vaccine was
[14:19.880 --> 14:26.680]  a vaccine which it wasn't or that it protected you now they admit it doesn't mainline science.
[14:26.680 --> 14:31.880]  They lied every step of the way and called the truth by prestigious scientists and doctors
[14:31.880 --> 14:37.640]  and researchers across the board and people who got sick or died from the shots they censored
[14:37.640 --> 14:47.680]  the victims over and over and over and over and over again.
[14:47.680 --> 14:53.000]  So here is the U.N. Spokeswoman the full videos on infoworks.com saying they own the science
[14:53.000 --> 14:57.680]  meaning they control and censor everything but guess what witch you're getting your ass
[14:57.680 --> 15:02.920]  handed to you you're lying fraud but here she is on international TV thanking Google
[15:02.920 --> 15:07.880]  for coordinating with the united nations to silence the people of the world.
[15:07.880 --> 15:10.560]  Here is the villainous witch.
[15:10.560 --> 15:15.760]  You know we partnered with Google for example if you Google climate change you will at the
[15:15.760 --> 15:21.120]  top of your search you will get all kinds of U.N. resources.
[15:21.120 --> 15:25.800]  We started this partnership when we were shocked to see that when we Googled climate
[15:25.800 --> 15:31.480]  change we were getting incredibly distorted information right at the top.
[15:31.480 --> 15:36.600]  So we're becoming much more proactive you know we own the science and we think that
[15:36.600 --> 15:46.560]  the world should know it and the platforms themselves also do but again it's a huge
[15:46.560 --> 15:52.960]  huge challenge that I think all sectors of society need to be very active in.
[15:52.960 --> 16:00.160]  That's the U.N. Secretary General for global communications Melissa Fleming.

[20:03.240 --> 20:28.640]  of the new world order it's alex jones take the journey to the bright midnight
[20:28.640 --> 20:44.280]  it is the end of the line for the new world order or it's the end for us they are waging
[20:44.280 --> 20:50.400]  direct war against humanity against infrastructure against family against sovereignty against
[20:50.400 --> 20:57.960]  every system that is self sufficient they want to take over and they see the vast majority
[20:57.960 --> 21:03.400]  of humans as useless eaters that are using up their new world order resources these people
[21:03.400 --> 21:11.400]  are beyond selfish so we just played the head of the united nations communications global
[21:11.400 --> 21:16.320]  communication system saying we own the science you can't question us you know everything we
[21:16.320 --> 21:22.080]  told you is a lie on record we should all go to prison and we want to thank google for
[21:22.080 --> 21:32.640]  making sure only our disinformation lies is fed to the public now everybody's seen these
[21:32.640 --> 21:37.520]  type of compilations before I don't usually play them we should play them more but it's
[21:37.520 --> 21:47.000]  where viewers researchers citizens out there that are watching a corporate propaganda will
[21:47.000 --> 21:55.400]  take clips of ABC NBC CBS CNN MSNBC all of them in PR PBS and show them reading the same
[21:55.400 --> 22:02.200]  script the same lie the same propaganda and they also do this with local news and it can
[22:02.200 --> 22:09.320]  be different network feeds that are local local affiliates to be ABC to be CBS to be
[22:09.320 --> 22:16.200]  fox they will put out the exact same propaganda in the exact same order in the exact same
[22:16.200 --> 22:23.000]  script so you can take 10 15 20 30 broadcast to 100 if you wanted to 1000 and line them
[22:23.000 --> 22:28.880]  up reading off the same script who writes that script comes down from the deep state
[22:28.880 --> 22:33.840]  the globalist the big corporate boards on record the congressional hearings about this
[22:33.840 --> 22:40.880]  in 1977 the church committees frank church senator frank church on the operation mockingbird
[22:40.880 --> 22:47.080]  and the CIA so this particular clip is about disinformation meaning independent media questioning
[22:47.080 --> 22:52.080]  and saying hey hydroxychloroquine ivermectin helps you all these big studies proving it
[22:52.080 --> 22:56.000]  now admitted or hey this shot won't protect you it's not a vaccine it will erase your
[22:56.000 --> 23:00.360]  muses or hey it's causing heart attacks their own documents show it that's all admitted
[23:00.360 --> 23:08.080]  now they knew they were lying in October 2000 we had the CDC document FDA documents admitting
[23:08.080 --> 23:14.240]  they knew it would cause heart attacks blood clots infertility cancer and they suppressed
[23:14.240 --> 23:20.280]  it because they'd already secretly tested it this was done by design to see if they
[23:20.280 --> 23:24.840]  can get away with it and this is just their first salvo if they get away with this they're
[23:24.840 --> 23:31.520]  going to do it over and over and over again so here's a short compilation of MSN local
[23:31.520 --> 23:37.200]  stations around the country calling for anybody questioning them to be shut down and how having
[23:37.200 --> 23:43.600]  free speech threatens democracy here it is and fox and antonios jessica headley and i'm
[23:43.600 --> 23:48.280]  ryan wolf our greatest responsibility is to serve our treasure valley communities deal
[23:48.280 --> 23:53.400]  pass a lust cruise started over again go to the front front and you already made this
[23:53.400 --> 23:59.720]  point but i want to sink in real good everybody in fact i'm going to have this video posted
[23:59.720 --> 24:03.640]  the live show feed under the live show today by the great jammy white out there working
[24:03.640 --> 24:08.120]  on sunday night i'm going to post the tweet i think you guys under that that has this
[24:08.120 --> 24:15.320]  this this video that just came out two days ago notice it's fox then it's abc then it's
[24:15.320 --> 24:21.360]  cbs then it's it's all the channel see why are they all being given the same script you
[24:21.360 --> 24:28.400]  think they're different other than tucker carlson and maybe laura ingram no no folks they're
[24:28.400 --> 24:33.800]  reading a script they're told to say this because they know you still trust local news
[24:33.800 --> 24:38.480]  and this is local news saying we need to censor i just showed you the un bragging they have
[24:38.480 --> 24:42.640]  global control i'm going to show you bill gates calling for some censorship and his
[24:42.640 --> 24:51.080]  foundation friday in a moment but i mean this is global government trying to silence you
[24:51.080 --> 24:56.520]  and if you're a radio listener you can't see that it's fox abc nbc it's again they're
[24:56.520 --> 25:01.640]  all supposed to different companies it'd be one thing if you had all the locals fox affiliates
[25:01.640 --> 25:06.760]  or all the local cnn affiliates you know they have those two they don't tell you it's cnn
[25:06.760 --> 25:15.320]  but it has different name on your cable channel but this is the smoking gun they're the disinfo
[25:15.320 --> 25:19.760]  and they don't want you know the truth about their poison shots or global warming or or
[25:19.760 --> 25:26.000]  any of it here started over and fox and antonios jessica headley and i'm ryan wolf our greatest
[25:26.000 --> 25:31.080]  responsibility is to serve our treasure valley communities the old pasalus cruises communities
[25:31.080 --> 25:36.480]  eastern iowa communities mid michigan communities we're extremely proud of the quality balanced
[25:36.480 --> 25:45.880]  journalism that cds4 news produces but we are concerned about the country plaguing our
[25:45.880 --> 25:51.560]  country the sharing of biased and false news has become all too common on social media
[25:51.560 --> 25:57.040]  more alarming some media outlets publish these same fake stories without checking facts first
[25:57.040 --> 26:03.000]  the sharing of biased and false news has become all too common on social media more alarming
[26:03.000 --> 26:09.360]  some media has been published in the history of our country without checking facts first
[26:09.360 --> 26:14.760]  unfortunately some members of the museum hate their platforms to push their own personal
[26:14.760 --> 26:19.760]  lives and agenda to control them exactly what people think and this is extremely dangerous
[26:19.760 --> 26:24.840]  to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous
[26:24.840 --> 26:29.520]  to our democracy this is extremely dangerous our democracy this is extremely dangerous
[26:29.520 --> 26:34.880]  to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous
[26:34.880 --> 26:39.980]  to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous
[26:39.980 --> 26:45.940]  to our democracy this is extremely dangerous to our democracy this is extremely dangerous
[26:45.940 --> 26:52.920]  dangerous to our democracy. This is extremely dangerous to our democracy!
[26:52.920 --> 27:01.260]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy!
[27:01.260 --> 27:08.440]  The only way they can gaslight you and cover up the millions of debt from heart attacks
[27:08.440 --> 27:13.460]  in the U.S. alone, and the cancer and exploding death of insurance companies admit, is if
[27:13.460 --> 27:20.860]  These lying criminals can't get their talking points and put them out without being challenged.
[27:20.860 --> 27:25.940]  If we're still on air, and if you go start a podcast, no matter if it's in your basement
[27:25.940 --> 27:31.060]  or in your kitchen or in your office, just get up there and give your own analysis, your
[27:31.060 --> 27:34.340]  own view of the world, and counter what they're saying.
[27:34.340 --> 27:36.140]  They can't shut us all down.
[27:36.140 --> 27:40.740]  The answer to beating this is not just supporting info wars, it's you going to city council,
[27:40.740 --> 27:44.420]  you going to county commensures, you going to the school board, you going to the state
[27:44.420 --> 27:49.420]  house, you calling in on talk radio, you calling in to C-SPAN, you running for office, that's
[27:49.420 --> 27:50.420]  how we're going to beat them.
[27:50.420 --> 27:52.300]  There's more of us than them.
[27:52.300 --> 27:56.740]  They want to divide us on race and all this other crap, we need to come together against
[27:56.740 --> 27:59.140]  these liars.
[27:59.140 --> 28:03.180]  But obviously they can't have me up here going, oh look, here they were saying 100% effective
[28:03.180 --> 28:09.220]  two years ago with a shot, and a month later 90%, and a month later 80%, and a month later
[28:09.220 --> 28:17.500]  70%, and two months later 60%, down to ineffective 44% more likely to get COVID, twice as likely
[28:17.500 --> 28:24.100]  to be hospitalized, seven times more likely British medical journal to die, seven times
[28:24.100 --> 28:26.140]  more likely to die.
[28:26.140 --> 28:34.540]  German study says nine times, not oh it works 40% of the time, no, it kills you.
[28:34.540 --> 28:39.020]  And they can't have us up here showing what they said two years ago versus now, so those
[28:39.020 --> 28:44.820]  little demonic parrots can sit there and read off a teleprompter, well guess what, we ain't
[28:44.820 --> 28:50.340]  reading off no teleprompter here, and we're not rolling over to dying while they come
[28:50.340 --> 28:56.020]  after newborn babies with their damn shots, so take the feeds of this show and share them
[28:56.020 --> 29:00.100]  like your life depends on it.
[29:00.100 --> 29:06.980]  Think about a world without info wars, just take a moment and sit back and think about
[29:06.980 --> 29:11.860]  all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together, this family
[29:11.860 --> 29:14.580]  that is info wars.
[29:14.580 --> 29:19.700]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bal Senaro and
[29:19.700 --> 29:27.180]  other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their
[29:27.180 --> 29:30.680]  main base to defeat the new world order.
[29:30.680 --> 29:36.420]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners
[29:36.420 --> 29:40.900]  of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[29:40.900 --> 29:46.940]  I don't take the credit, I give you the credit, and now info wars is facing it's darkest hours

[34:01.540 --> 34:05.340]  The truth is the power of our source.
[34:05.340 --> 34:10.940]  All right, so I just played you a few clubs, the UN head of information globally.
[34:10.940 --> 34:15.860]  We control science, we control info, we censor everyone.
[34:15.860 --> 34:18.740]  We lot everybody about the deadly shots, everything else.
[34:18.740 --> 34:26.700]  And then I played you a newscast compilation of CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox, all local affiliates
[34:26.700 --> 34:27.780]  saying the same thing.
[34:27.780 --> 34:29.660]  We got a sense of the American people.
[34:29.660 --> 34:30.740]  We got to shut it down.
[34:30.740 --> 34:33.140]  It's dangerous to democracy.
[34:33.140 --> 34:37.660]  Know what they're doing is dangerous to a free and open society.
[34:37.660 --> 34:45.660]  And then we have Cal Penn, another one of these Hollywood actors, comics with Bill Gates.
[34:45.660 --> 34:50.100]  They've always got a bono or some music person or actor up there to make it all cool and
[34:50.100 --> 34:56.340]  who's so Hollywood talking about dealing with disinformation, meaning challenging Bill
[34:56.340 --> 35:00.660]  Gates' lies, challenging the UN lies.
[35:00.660 --> 35:02.540]  Here's the club.
[35:02.540 --> 35:09.260]  What a nice space, nice, bright, beautiful day.
[35:09.260 --> 35:11.820]  Maybe enough for you all have a little too much sun in your eyes.
[35:11.820 --> 35:12.820]  Sorry.
[35:12.820 --> 35:13.820]  All right.
[35:13.820 --> 35:14.820]  It looks nice from where I'm standing.
[35:14.820 --> 35:15.820]  Thank you for having me.
[35:15.820 --> 35:21.900]  Now look, this panel is about misinformation, and that is something very selfishly, I think
[35:21.900 --> 35:28.620]  almost every actor or politician or athlete or musician knows something about.
[35:28.620 --> 35:34.020]  There are gossip blogs masquerading as journalists, there are conspiracy theorists with YouTube
[35:34.020 --> 35:35.020]  followings.
[35:35.020 --> 35:37.900]  There's like, there's a lot to choose from if you're in the market for something that's
[35:37.900 --> 35:40.020]  a little bit nuts.
[35:40.020 --> 35:45.540]  I remember when I worked as an aide to President Obama, I remember some folks were completely
[35:45.540 --> 35:50.060]  convinced that I had taken a leave of absence from acting and was placed into the White
[35:50.060 --> 35:57.060]  House to orchestrate a massive propaganda machine through which artists would sell people
[35:57.060 --> 35:59.420]  on the Affordable Care Act or the ACA.
[35:59.420 --> 36:00.420]  By the way, pause.
[36:00.420 --> 36:01.420]  Obviously, we all know that.
[36:01.420 --> 36:02.920]  Back in 10 seconds.
[36:02.920 --> 36:08.500]  It was on record that they hired hundreds of thousands of prominent, what they now
[36:08.500 --> 36:13.140]  call today influencers.
[36:13.140 --> 36:17.780]  It's on record the federal government with the injections hired millions of people.
[36:17.780 --> 36:24.100]  Most folks got $500, $1,000, some got hundreds of thousands of dollars, big NBA and NFL players.
[36:24.100 --> 36:31.460]  So he's up there flat out lying to you, Bill Gates spent $300 million in the last two years
[36:31.460 --> 36:35.860]  alone on paying off media for scripts he once put out.
[36:35.860 --> 36:42.900]  This guy up there on screen, what's this moron's name?
[36:42.900 --> 36:43.900]  What's this idiot's name?
[36:43.900 --> 36:45.380]  What clip is it?
[36:45.380 --> 36:47.260]  Cal Penn.
[36:47.260 --> 36:53.860]  This guy's up there publicly paid to do this on the payroll at this event, guaranteed
[36:53.860 --> 36:59.860]  telling the viewers and telling the attendees that start the whole clip over that it was
[36:59.860 --> 37:09.580]  crazy people thought an entertainer was hired to be brought in to sell the Obama scam, which
[37:09.580 --> 37:10.580]  triple prices.
[37:10.580 --> 37:14.940]  So it would be the cost of your phone bill or cable bill when you saw it triple, not
[37:14.940 --> 37:17.700]  cut your bill by two thirds.
[37:17.700 --> 37:22.980]  So just again, everything he says is a lie and now he's going to tell you about dealing
[37:22.980 --> 37:23.980]  with disinformation.
[37:23.980 --> 37:24.980]  Here it is.
[37:24.980 --> 37:31.620]  What a nice space, nice, bright, beautiful day, maybe enough for you all have a little
[37:31.620 --> 37:32.620]  too much sun in your eyes.
[37:32.620 --> 37:33.620]  Sorry.
[37:33.620 --> 37:34.620]  All right.
[37:34.620 --> 37:35.620]  It looks nice from where I'm standing.
[37:35.620 --> 37:36.620]  Thank you for having me.
[37:36.620 --> 37:42.820]  Now look, this panel is about misinformation and that is something very selfishly, I think
[37:42.820 --> 37:49.540]  almost every actor or politician or athlete or musician knows something about.
[37:49.540 --> 37:54.980]  There are gossip blogs masquerading as journalists, there are conspiracy theorists with YouTube
[37:54.980 --> 37:55.980]  followings.
[37:55.980 --> 37:58.860]  There's like, there's a lot to choose from if you're in the market for something that's
[37:58.860 --> 38:00.980]  a little bit nuts.
[38:00.980 --> 38:06.480]  I remember when I worked as an aide to President Obama, I remember some folks were completely
[38:06.480 --> 38:11.020]  convinced that I had taken the leave of absence from acting and was placed into the White
[38:11.020 --> 38:18.020]  House to orchestrate a massive propaganda machine through which artists would sell people
[38:18.020 --> 38:21.020]  on the Affordable Care Act or the ACA.
[38:21.020 --> 38:25.900]  Obviously, we all know that if that was true, the rollout of the ACA would have gone smoothly,
[38:25.900 --> 38:27.540]  which it did not.
[38:27.540 --> 38:29.620]  So it's not my fault.
[38:29.620 --> 38:34.900]  When you add misinformation into a mix, back in five seconds, notice he didn't say it's
[38:34.900 --> 38:38.060]  not true.
[38:38.060 --> 38:39.060]  Very slick writing.
[38:39.060 --> 38:42.580]  He's been given to say, this is next level.
[38:42.580 --> 38:45.420]  He doesn't say it's not true that he was paid to do that, he was paid in the White House
[38:45.420 --> 38:46.420]  to roll that out.
[38:46.420 --> 38:47.420]  That's what he did.
[38:47.420 --> 38:53.620]  He says, if it was true, they would have had a good rollout of it, was designed to wreck
[38:53.620 --> 38:54.620]  American healthcare.
[38:54.620 --> 38:58.900]  The Zika Lemanual would help write it, set us to sign to destroy American healthcare
[38:58.900 --> 39:03.380]  and bring in a new system.
[39:03.380 --> 39:05.980]  But you all know they pay influencers.
[39:05.980 --> 39:08.940]  It's on record, but he's lying to you.
[39:08.940 --> 39:09.940]  Continue.
[39:09.940 --> 39:15.220]  Go ahead and roll the clip if you can please.
[39:15.220 --> 39:20.660]  Through which artists would sell people on the Affordable Care Act or the ACA.
[39:20.660 --> 39:25.740]  Obviously, we all know that if that was true, the rollout of the ACA would have gone smoothly,
[39:25.740 --> 39:27.380]  which it did not.
[39:27.380 --> 39:29.460]  So it's not my fault.
[39:29.460 --> 39:36.140]  When you add misinformation into a mix of passion and emotion and history and mistrust,
[39:36.140 --> 39:41.340]  our world's most audacious accomplishments can easily be extinguished.
[39:41.340 --> 39:46.780]  According to recent polling, 70% of people believe the spread of false information to
[39:46.780 --> 39:49.060]  be a major threat.
[39:49.060 --> 39:51.260]  That's higher than cyber attacks.
[39:51.260 --> 39:53.940]  That's higher than infectious diseases.
[39:53.940 --> 39:55.580]  That's higher than threats to the economy.
[39:55.580 --> 40:01.420]  So this perception is the biggest threat behind climate change.
[40:01.420 --> 40:05.820]  It's clear that over the past two years, we've seen more confusing and conflicting information
[40:05.820 --> 40:11.660]  than ever, despite the new innovative solutions that the world has benefited from.
[40:11.660 --> 40:17.380]  So Jacinda Arden, the globalist WEF minion that runs New Zealand, she said it's worse
[40:17.380 --> 40:19.340]  than weapons of mass destruction.
[40:19.340 --> 40:20.340]  It's the new weapons.
[40:20.340 --> 40:25.140]  Of course, let's put on screen for TV viewers, radio listeners, I'll read the headline.
[40:25.140 --> 40:31.580]  There were big articles at the time how he, the very comedian on screen, along with others,
[40:31.580 --> 40:36.940]  was hired to produce TV ads promoting Obamacare.
[40:36.940 --> 40:44.220]  He just told you that it was a conspiracy and wasn't real, thinking you can't remember
[40:44.220 --> 40:50.020]  10 years ago.
[40:50.020 --> 40:52.860]  There's the Charlotte Observer calling healthcare a right.
[40:52.860 --> 41:00.220]  Most North Carolina influencers say expanded Medicare, keep Obamacare.
[41:00.220 --> 41:06.780]  So there they are in the news being paid to do it, and he comes out and says, these crazy
[41:06.780 --> 41:08.620]  people say I was paid to do it.
[41:08.620 --> 41:16.900]  Well, that was true, it would have gone better.
[41:16.900 --> 41:19.180]  But they're targeting morons.
[41:19.180 --> 41:21.060]  They're targeting unconscious people.
[41:21.060 --> 41:24.540]  It's extremely criminal, it's extremely dangerous.
[41:24.540 --> 41:26.260]  All right, I'm done talking about that.
[41:26.260 --> 41:29.500]  I'm going to come back and hit the Russian news, the economy news.
[41:29.500 --> 41:33.780]  2023 will be the year from hell, top financial analysts mourns, and I agree we're going to
[41:33.780 --> 41:37.260]  be getting ready for this and laying it out next segment ahead of a very special guest
[41:37.260 --> 41:38.260]  in the second hour.
[41:38.260 --> 41:42.660]  But I'm going to say this again, I'm not sponsored by Bill Gates or George Soros of
[41:42.660 --> 41:43.660]  the New World Order.
[41:43.660 --> 41:47.140]  I'm sponsored by you, plus I've got great products you need.
[41:47.140 --> 41:51.740]  We're running for only like eight, nine days more until next Sunday, not this Sunday today,
[41:51.740 --> 41:54.940]  but next week, about seven, eight days out.

[43:00.180 --> 43:04.820]  Look around you, everything I predicted from the Globalistone documents, from their own
[43:04.820 --> 43:10.700]  admissions is now happening, InfoWars credibility, my credibility has never been higher and it's
[43:10.700 --> 43:16.020]  because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship
[43:16.020 --> 43:21.580]  and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits stay on air, but now we're reaching the most
[43:21.580 --> 43:24.820]  critical juncture in the fight together.
[43:24.820 --> 43:31.140]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air, in my decades on air I've
[43:31.140 --> 43:35.220]  never asked for personal donations, but I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay
[43:35.220 --> 43:40.700]  for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself, it's unsustainable.
[43:40.700 --> 43:48.700]  So please, visit SaveInfoWars.com, SaveInfoWars.com where you can make straight donations, five,
[43:48.700 --> 43:52.980]  ten, fifty hundred dollars, whatever you can, so that I can continue to persevere.
[43:52.980 --> 43:56.220]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[43:56.220 --> 44:01.140]  Thank you for your support, wouldn't be without you, SaveInfoWars.com.
[44:01.140 --> 44:06.060]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the Globalistone.
[44:06.060 --> 44:12.580]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America but the world.
[44:12.580 --> 44:18.100]  We are engaging the Globalist at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't
[44:18.100 --> 44:19.100]  deserve the credit.
[44:19.100 --> 44:24.060]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support InfoWars for the real
[44:24.060 --> 44:29.660]  reason you've had the success, we're having now the greatest victories in the fight against
[44:29.660 --> 44:32.020]  the new order you've ever had.
[44:32.020 --> 44:38.740]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon, and that's why today it's more important
[44:38.740 --> 44:42.700]  than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the
[44:42.700 --> 44:45.540]  efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify them.
[44:45.540 --> 44:51.220]  God bless you all, I salute you, I thank you, and I beg you to intensify what you're doing
[44:51.220 --> 44:55.100]  now because we are over the target and this dream is happening.
[44:55.100 --> 44:59.980]  The fight is my fight, it's your fight, it's our fight, God bless you all.
[44:59.980 --> 45:06.060]  By the will of God and by God working through you and your support, InfoWars continues to
[45:06.060 --> 45:10.900]  persevere against the attacks never before seen in the western world against independent
[45:10.900 --> 45:11.900]  media.
[45:11.900 --> 45:12.900]  Thanks for keeping me in the fight.
[45:12.900 --> 45:17.620]  And over the years you have come to the table, you have stepped to the plate so many times
[45:17.620 --> 45:21.020]  and kept InfoWars and Free Speech on the air, and I thank you.
[45:21.020 --> 45:25.460]  But now I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them and
[45:25.460 --> 45:26.460]  I need your support.
[45:26.460 --> 45:31.180]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward, if you want to back me in this fight

[47:00.540 --> 47:28.460]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:28.460 --> 47:33.620]  Sunday night, we're live, we're battling the globalists at Point Blank Range, and the Democratic
[47:33.620 --> 47:39.540]  Party lawyers are all over the news saying their mission is to silence InfoWars and then
[47:39.540 --> 47:40.540]  you.
[47:40.540 --> 47:45.700]  These are tyrants.
[47:45.700 --> 47:53.580]  I ask that with your verdict, you not only take Alex Jones' platform that he talks about
[47:53.580 --> 47:54.580]  away.
[47:54.580 --> 48:00.340]  I ask that you make certain he can't rebuild the platform.
[48:00.340 --> 48:03.540]  That's what matters.
[48:03.540 --> 48:11.580]  Take him out of this discourse, of this misinformation, of this peddling of lies, and make sure he
[48:11.580 --> 48:15.260]  can't do it again.
[48:15.260 --> 48:17.260]  That is punishment.
[48:17.260 --> 48:18.260]  That is deterrence.
[48:18.260 --> 48:28.260]  But somewhere out there right now is another thing, getting their picture ready for school.
[48:28.260 --> 48:33.260]  Fixing their lunches, going to work, they could not take care of it.
[48:33.260 --> 48:38.660]  And there can be a day when that child doesn't come home from school, and we know it and
[48:38.660 --> 48:39.660]  it's sad and it's reality.
[48:39.660 --> 48:44.660]  And the question is going to be where is Alex Jones when that happens?
[48:44.660 --> 48:53.660]  Is he in the studio, get ready to bounce, or will you stop him?
[48:53.660 --> 48:58.660]  That's going to be your answer.
[48:58.660 --> 49:04.660]  And if we get all done with all the evidence, we're going to come back and ask him.
[49:04.660 --> 49:07.660]  Because that's what justice is in this case.
[49:07.660 --> 49:11.660]  They've got to silence you before they can carry out their operations against you.
[49:11.660 --> 49:13.660]  They think they can break your will.
[49:13.660 --> 49:18.660]  To moralize you, but they won't.
[49:18.660 --> 49:27.660]  I told my wife when I got remarried six years ago in Hawaii, I told her within five years
[49:27.660 --> 49:31.660]  I want to hand the baton of M4s over to Owen Schreuer and others.
[49:31.660 --> 49:35.660]  I'll do a podcast once a week, maybe write books, but I can't do this for decade after
[49:35.660 --> 49:36.660]  decade.
[49:36.660 --> 49:37.660]  It's killing me.
[49:37.660 --> 49:39.660]  But now the new order is out in the open.
[49:39.660 --> 49:40.660]  We didn't stop it.
[49:40.660 --> 49:42.660]  We just got ready for it.
[49:42.660 --> 49:44.660]  And now we've got a fighting chance.
[49:44.660 --> 49:47.660]  No, because they're lust to shut us down.
[49:47.660 --> 49:49.660]  I tell you all, I'll never give up.
[49:49.660 --> 49:52.660]  And we're already expanding the amount of shows we do.
[49:52.660 --> 49:53.660]  And so much more is coming.
[49:53.660 --> 49:57.660]  Not just the number one book, not just the number one film, but so much more to quote
[49:57.660 --> 50:00.660]  John Paul Jones, the founder of the U.S. Navy.
[50:00.660 --> 50:03.660]  When the British told him to surrender, he said, I've only begun to fight.
[50:03.660 --> 50:08.660]  And he took that enemy ship as his ship sunk and won that famous battle.
[50:08.660 --> 50:15.660]  We will win because we have you as an audience of activists and we have God on our side.
[50:15.660 --> 50:18.660]  So let's talk about monstrous disinformation.
[50:18.660 --> 50:20.660]  They use dead kids to try to take your guns.
[50:20.660 --> 50:23.660]  They use dead kids to try to take your speech.
[50:23.660 --> 50:25.660]  These ghouls.
[50:25.660 --> 50:29.660]  You have the head of the U.N. Information Bureau saying we own the science.
[50:29.660 --> 50:33.660]  We're going to shut down the dirty Americans, the dirty Brits, the dirty Scots, the dirty
[50:33.660 --> 50:36.660]  Irish, the dirty Germans.
[50:36.660 --> 50:39.660]  You see all their fake newscasts we just exposed.
[50:39.660 --> 50:41.660]  We showed you Bill Gates' minion.
[50:41.660 --> 50:43.660]  We'll talk about this info.
[50:43.660 --> 50:45.660]  Look at this video.
[50:45.660 --> 50:50.660]  Canada, one of the last countries in the world, drops COVID-19 restrictions, ends mass mandate
[50:50.660 --> 50:52.660]  because everybody's turning against them.
[50:52.660 --> 50:55.660]  Same things happening here in the U.S. with medical workers.
[50:55.660 --> 51:01.660]  Tragedy, 20-year-old med student dies from heart attack one day after COVID vaccine.
[51:01.660 --> 51:06.660]  Hey, an actress revealed she had Bell's palsy two weeks after Vax said she'd taken it in.
[51:06.660 --> 51:08.660]  Stockholm syndrome.
[51:08.660 --> 51:13.660]  Pfizer's CEO bales on EU testimony because now there's criminal investigations after
[51:13.660 --> 51:18.660]  a report highlights secretive vaccine deal that's totally illegal.
[51:18.660 --> 51:23.660]  The growing global reliance on antidepressants, 20% of the Western world's on these drugs
[51:23.660 --> 51:27.660]  and on record are linked directly to cancer, infertility, and more.
[51:27.660 --> 51:29.660]  Oh, but they're the good guys.
[51:29.660 --> 51:32.660]  Meanwhile, a giant screwed you to taxpayers.
[51:32.660 --> 51:38.660]  Fauci's pal, Peter Dazik, is awarded new government NIH grant to study back coronavirus in Asia
[51:38.660 --> 51:41.660]  like he was already doing.
[51:41.660 --> 51:44.660]  CDC ends mass requirements in healthcare.
[51:44.660 --> 51:46.660]  And almost nobody noticed.
[51:46.660 --> 51:48.660]  Everything they said was a lie.
[51:48.660 --> 51:50.660]  They are the kings of disinformation.
[51:50.660 --> 51:52.660]  They are the fraud.
[51:52.660 --> 51:56.660]  Engage in economic warfare with the price of antidepressants.
[51:56.660 --> 52:00.660]  They're the fraud. Engage in economic warfare with the private central banks and get that
[52:00.660 --> 52:03.660]  Greta Thunberg clip ready.
[52:03.660 --> 52:08.660]  With the private central banks of the world that issue all the currency themselves and
[52:08.660 --> 52:12.660]  leave us with the debt, leave us with an evaluation.
[52:12.660 --> 52:16.660]  They have issued quadrillions of money themselves.
[52:16.660 --> 52:21.660]  Done all this and now, oh, Biden said Obama's third administration that he would forgive the
[52:21.660 --> 52:22.660]  student debt.
[52:22.660 --> 52:24.660]  Turns out now he isn't going to.
[52:24.660 --> 52:26.660]  It's all bait and switches.
[52:26.660 --> 52:29.660]  2023 will be the year from hell.
[52:29.660 --> 52:35.660]  Top financial analysts warns Europe could be sucked the rest of the world into the tubes.
[52:35.660 --> 52:40.660]  Legendary financial geopolitical analyst Martin Armstrong went back on this week.
[52:40.660 --> 52:42.660]  He predicted a year ago on the show and six months ago on the show.
[52:42.660 --> 52:50.660]  Says nothing is going to get better by the end 2022 and it's still forecasting chaos coming in 2023.
[52:50.660 --> 52:55.660]  Laverne Spencer asked the question on Twitter, well, the federal government's just going to print
[52:55.660 --> 52:56.660]  whatever money it wants.
[52:56.660 --> 52:58.660]  Why do we still pay taxes?
[52:58.660 --> 53:01.660]  Because you pay them because you selectively pay them.
[53:01.660 --> 53:03.660]  They don't to shut your business down.
[53:03.660 --> 53:04.660]  Not them.
[53:04.660 --> 53:05.660]  It's economic warfare.
[53:05.660 --> 53:07.660]  And here's the clip I was mentioning.
[53:07.660 --> 53:12.660]  Greta Thunberg, the Antifa daughter, the front person saying, how dare you?
[53:12.660 --> 53:17.660]  You will pay for not cutting off the resources, starving the third world to death.
[53:17.660 --> 53:23.660]  She gets up at a UN event and says we've got to give the banks whatever they want.
[53:23.660 --> 53:25.660]  We got to give the central banks unlimited currency.
[53:25.660 --> 53:27.660]  Prince Charles called for it.
[53:27.660 --> 53:30.660]  Now King Charles called for it as the king.
[53:30.660 --> 53:35.660]  They want unlimited currency more than exist in the world to fight a war against carbon
[53:35.660 --> 53:39.660]  when we're carbon based life forms and plants live off of carbon.
[53:39.660 --> 53:44.660]  They're banning, farming and ranching all the world mass starvation and then turning around
[53:44.660 --> 53:47.660]  and posing as the saviors as it unfolds.
[53:47.660 --> 53:49.660]  And here's Greta Thunberg, clearly autistic.
[53:49.660 --> 53:51.660]  They admit she is.
[53:51.660 --> 53:55.660]  Giving scripts to read like a robot, like a biological android.
[53:55.660 --> 53:59.660]  Like you pull the string and she says what you want.
[53:59.660 --> 54:02.660]  Save the bank, save the world.
[54:02.660 --> 54:03.660]  That's right.
[54:03.660 --> 54:06.660]  And the Leonardo DiCaprio's and the Prince Charles's of the world fly around in their
[54:06.660 --> 54:11.660]  private jets and party and live on giant mansions, but you can't have air conditioning.
[54:11.660 --> 54:12.660]  You can't have a car.
[54:12.660 --> 54:13.660]  You can't have food.
[54:13.660 --> 54:16.660]  You're going to eat bugs.
[54:16.660 --> 54:22.660]  The most selfish, arrogant, hypocritical, fraudulent people the world's ever seen.
[54:22.660 --> 54:29.660]  She flies in on private jets to lecture you that you want gas heating in the winter.
[54:29.660 --> 54:31.660]  Greta Thunberg, we can save the banks.
[54:31.660 --> 54:36.660]  We can save the world.
[54:36.660 --> 54:44.660]  There is this debate going on within the Democratic Party as it tries to decide who to run against
[54:44.660 --> 54:51.660]  Donald Trump about whether or not to have a response to climate change that is very bold,
[54:51.660 --> 54:54.660]  that spends a lot of money to do these transformations.
[54:54.660 --> 54:58.660]  And this counter response, which is it's too much.
[54:58.660 --> 55:00.660]  It's too big.
[55:00.660 --> 55:02.660]  It's too expensive.
[55:02.660 --> 55:07.660]  Do you have anything to add to these debates about about just in particular the idea that
[55:07.660 --> 55:10.660]  it's kind of too expensive to deal with climate change?
[55:10.660 --> 55:14.660]  I mean, it is the money is there.
[55:14.660 --> 55:19.660]  If we can save the banks, if then we can save the world.
[55:19.660 --> 55:24.660]  I mean, all the banks as 2019.
[55:24.660 --> 55:26.660]  Now you see him saying it everywhere.
[55:26.660 --> 55:28.660]  Oh, she's so incredible.
[55:28.660 --> 55:29.660]  Save the banks.
[55:29.660 --> 55:30.660]  Save the world.
[55:30.660 --> 55:37.660]  India to shut down banks for 20 days to bring out their new digital currency.
[55:37.660 --> 55:40.660]  Stock suffered their worst September of 2002.
[55:40.660 --> 55:42.660]  What does that mean for October?
[55:42.660 --> 55:47.660]  I think you know what that means, ladies and gentlemen.
[55:47.660 --> 55:51.660]  Meanwhile, here's a photo of downtown Los Angeles today.
[55:51.660 --> 55:55.660]  Regular fuel 835.
[55:55.660 --> 56:01.660]  Plus 837 supreme at Chevron.
[56:01.660 --> 56:05.660]  $8 and 39 cents diesel 855.
[56:05.660 --> 56:08.660]  But there's no inflation.
[56:08.660 --> 56:11.660]  We have the Goya food CEO.
[56:11.660 --> 56:12.660]  They're a great company.
[56:12.660 --> 56:16.660]  Some of the best beans and things out there says food shortages are very real.
[56:16.660 --> 56:21.660]  There's mass starvation happening worldwide because of the lockdowns, the UN and the new order ran.
[56:21.660 --> 56:24.660]  We're going to play that clip coming up ahead of Larry Pinkney joining us.
[56:24.660 --> 56:26.660]  We've got the Russia news.
[56:26.660 --> 56:28.660]  We've got patriots being elected everywhere news.
[56:28.660 --> 56:30.660]  We've got Hillary calling for censorship news.
[56:30.660 --> 56:35.660]  If anybody that questions elections, though she famously questions them, it's all coming up.
[56:35.660 --> 56:40.660]  But remember, the globalists are obsessed with shutting down info wars.
[56:40.660 --> 56:43.660]  If you spread the word about the broadcast, if you share the videos and articles,
[56:43.660 --> 56:46.660]  if you continue to fight and realize how important you are,
[56:46.660 --> 56:52.660]  and if you continue to get great products you already need at infowarstore.com, we can persevere.
[56:52.660 --> 56:55.660]  There will be a major victory for the enemy, but they can shut us down.

[56:58.660 --> 57:01.660]  We don't have two million dollars extra to run this operation.
[57:01.660 --> 57:03.660]  We've got like two million dollars.
[57:03.660 --> 57:05.660]  That's nothing with payroll and the crew and all the rest of it.

[1:00:16.660 --> 1:00:42.660]  With our government guilty of pushing a deadly experimental vaccine,
[1:00:42.660 --> 1:01:01.660]  Denver is now handing out free bug out bags to help you just in case you run into emergency.
[1:01:01.660 --> 1:01:06.660]  Lisa, all right, I asked you last time, I need to know the checklist of everything I gotta put in my bug out bag.
[1:01:06.660 --> 1:01:14.660]  Toilet paper, paper towels, toilet paper, paper towels, we've got cotton balls, two opportunities to get these free emergency preparedness bags.
[1:01:14.660 --> 1:01:18.660]  So really an important effort, especially when we're talking about severe weather.
[1:01:18.660 --> 1:01:23.660]  Yeah, and I know a lot of people are going to go and get those bags, but for people who maybe can't make it out there,
[1:01:23.660 --> 1:01:27.660]  is there anything in there that's, you know, too tough that you couldn't just put one of those together yourself?
[1:01:27.660 --> 1:01:30.660]  Yeah, there's a lot of stuff you could easily put together yourself.
[1:01:30.660 --> 1:01:34.660]  I mean, if you got any extra cotton balls, you know, paper towels, toilet paper.
[1:01:34.660 --> 1:01:41.660]  Denver is letting the locals know they should be prepared for an unexpected order to get out of town in a hurry.
[1:01:41.660 --> 1:01:46.660]  And many people are connecting dots between this and the Denver International Airport.
[1:01:46.660 --> 1:01:55.660]  The Denver International Airport has long been rumored to be sitting atop an underground military base built deep beneath the surface
[1:01:55.660 --> 1:01:58.660]  and connected to several other underground bases.
[1:01:58.660 --> 1:02:06.660]  These rumors are the result of several interesting facts. From 1995 until he was found dead a year later,
[1:02:06.660 --> 1:02:14.660]  Phil Schneider gave dozens of lectures claiming to be a geological engineer hired to build deep underground military bases
[1:02:14.660 --> 1:02:17.660]  known as DUMMS for the U.S. government.
[1:02:17.660 --> 1:02:27.660]  His father was Captain Oscar Schneider, a former Nazi stationed in Florida working black operations for naval intelligence.
[1:02:27.660 --> 1:02:32.660]  Phil Schneider was showing samples of what he claimed were unknown exotic metals.
[1:02:32.660 --> 1:02:40.660]  He provided maps of the underground DUMMS and showed off dramatic scars that he claimed were from a violent skirmish
[1:02:40.660 --> 1:02:43.660]  with a non-human species deep underground.
[1:02:43.660 --> 1:02:51.660]  In January of 1996, Schneider was found dead in his home days after he mysteriously died of strangulation.
[1:02:51.660 --> 1:02:55.660]  Investigations were never completed and it was ruled a suicide.
[1:02:55.660 --> 1:03:03.660]  His evidence went missing. Before he died, Phil Schneider used his clearance to take investigative author Alex Christopher
[1:03:03.660 --> 1:03:11.660]  into the top underground levels of the Denver Airport where they took pictures of a long road heading off to multiple destinations.
[1:03:11.660 --> 1:03:21.660]  Built upon 53 square miles of land, 25 miles from downtown, the Denver Airport was billions of dollars over budget.
[1:03:21.660 --> 1:03:29.660]  Different contractors were hired for each section, some of whom have come forward and claimed it would take days to show you what's down there.
[1:03:29.660 --> 1:03:37.660]  Inside the otherwise unimpressive airport, there is a capstone with cryptic Illuminati and Masonic imagery
[1:03:37.660 --> 1:03:42.660]  marking a time capsule buried beneath to be opened in 2094.
[1:03:42.660 --> 1:03:52.660]  The airport opened with a famous four-piece mural depicting biological warfare, death and destruction, the surrender of all national sovereignty,
[1:03:52.660 --> 1:04:01.660]  and the emergence of a new religion. On the floor, for no apparent reason, is what appears to be the symbol for gold and silver in a mining cart,
[1:04:01.660 --> 1:04:09.660]  AU AG, which is also the abbreviation for a deadly strain of hepatitis discovered in 1965.
[1:04:09.660 --> 1:04:17.660]  Outside on the surface, the runways form the shape of a swastika, and passengers are greeted by what has become known as Blucifer,
[1:04:17.660 --> 1:04:27.660]  a 32-foot horse with glowing red eyes that reportedly killed its creator when a piece of the sculpture came loose and severed an artery in his leg.
[1:04:27.660 --> 1:04:37.660]  This is why many people are talking about Denver's bug out bag program, which is good because now that we know who the people committing these historic crimes against humanity are,
[1:04:37.660 --> 1:04:44.660]  we can't just let them slip away into some hole somewhere. Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.

[1:06:08.660 --> 1:06:13.660]  Live from the Infowars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:13.660 --> 1:06:20.660]  I used to be such a sweet sweet thing, so hey, that was over me.
[1:06:20.660 --> 1:06:27.660]  I opened doors for little old ladies. I helped the blind to see.
[1:06:27.660 --> 1:06:32.660]  I got no friends. I got no friends because they read the papers.
[1:06:32.660 --> 1:06:46.660]  You know, I take it as an extreme honor that thousands of TV stations and thousands of newspapers globally attack us every day.
[1:06:46.660 --> 1:06:50.660]  And it's because they're scared of the unity we're creating.
[1:06:50.660 --> 1:07:00.660]  They're scared of how America and the world's coming together around populism and freedom and justice, and we understand the false flags and the fraudulent wars and the lies.
[1:07:00.660 --> 1:07:05.660]  And so I don't like being attacked, but at the end of the day, I know it's a symbol of our success.
[1:07:05.660 --> 1:07:19.660]  And I wanted to get Larry Pinckney on tonight to talk about their attempts to create racial division and attacks in this country and how we transcend that and stop it together because they win if we don't realize what's happening.
[1:07:19.660 --> 1:07:26.660]  And I want to get into the wars and so much more with this icon, this author, this researcher, blackactivistwg.org.
[1:07:26.660 --> 1:07:32.660]  He's a veteran founding member of the real Black Panther Party, not the racist black KKK, new Black Panther Party.
[1:07:32.660 --> 1:07:38.660]  The former minister of Interior, Republic of New Africa, a former political president, the only American that was successfully self-authored.
[1:07:38.660 --> 1:07:48.660]  His civil political rights case, the United Nations under the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights in connection with the political organizing activities in opposition to voter suppression.
[1:07:48.660 --> 1:07:57.660]  Pinckney was interviewed in 1998, National Titleized PBS NewsHour, formerly known as the McNeil NewsHour. He is the editorial board member of blackcommentator.com.
[1:07:57.660 --> 1:08:05.660]  And Larry, I didn't talk to you, but the crew did. I said, what does Larry want to hit first? He said, he wants to talk about the persecution of the press and give us words of encouragement.
[1:08:05.660 --> 1:08:14.660]  So let's go there first and we'll cover the waterfront, my brother, in the human struggle for a pro-human future. God bless you, my friend. Thanks for spending time with us.
[1:08:14.660 --> 1:08:31.660]  God bless you, Alex. All power to the people. First of all, I want to say, as always, it's a pleasure and honor and a delight to be spending time with you and the magnificent, magnificent crew of info wars.
[1:08:31.660 --> 1:08:40.660]  I mean that. I mean it. And that's why I say it all the time. There's something, a message that I have for you, though, Alex, you personally.
[1:08:40.660 --> 1:08:53.660]  And that message is this, whether you like it or not, you are the Paul Revere and the Christmas addicts of the 21st century. That's what you are. That's who you are.
[1:08:53.660 --> 1:09:04.660]  Whether you want to be there or not, you're doing what you know you have to do and you're doing it for our republic, for everyday ordinary black, white, brown, red and yellow people.
[1:09:04.660 --> 1:09:17.660]  And so, my brother, I know the burden is heavy. Believe me. But let me remind you, as you carry on in this struggle, let me remind you that you are not alone.
[1:09:17.660 --> 1:09:24.660]  There are millions with you and it is rapidly growing. I appreciate you so much, brother.
[1:09:24.660 --> 1:09:25.660]  Paul, I love you too.
[1:09:25.660 --> 1:09:33.660]  And so, so do many, many, many, many other people. So I'll keep quiet and go where we shall go.
[1:09:33.660 --> 1:09:37.660]  No, no, you kick it off. What do you want to hit first with all the craziness?
[1:09:37.660 --> 1:09:54.660]  Well, I think numero uno, number one, I want to make it crystal clear that our quote unquote government, and I put the word hour in quotation mark, is not our government.
[1:09:54.660 --> 1:10:10.660]  That Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, Kamala Harris, and the rest of the insane ilk, don't give a rat's petunia about the everyday ordinary people, be they black, white, brown, red, yellow, all right?
[1:10:10.660 --> 1:10:26.660]  And that we are the ones who hold the key, everyday ordinary people. We are the ones who hold the key to not only our republic, first and foremost, but to planetary survival.
[1:10:26.660 --> 1:10:41.660]  We are on the brink of extinction if we allow these mad, mad, insane, psychotic, so-called leaders, and I say so-called because they're not leaders, they're misleaders.
[1:10:41.660 --> 1:10:48.660]  You know, Kamala Harris obviously doesn't know the difference between North Korea and South Korea to put it mildly.
[1:10:48.660 --> 1:10:55.660]  Joe Biden is a fascist. Why do I say that? That seems like it's a very strong statement.
[1:10:55.660 --> 1:11:04.660]  He said to Joe Brown's face that he didn't like black people and love the KKK. He is arrogant.
[1:11:04.660 --> 1:11:20.660]  He is beyond arrogant, my good brother. Joe Biden said, quote, if you remember, if our audience remembers, okay, quote, you ain't black if you don't vote for me, you don't support me.
[1:11:20.660 --> 1:11:32.660]  Now, that's a fascistic statement. That's a statement that easily could have come out of the mouth of Adolf Hitler, of Vanito Mussolini, of Francisco Franco.
[1:11:32.660 --> 1:11:43.660]  He is a fascist. And let me be clear about that. He and his ilk are neo-liberal fascists. Make no mistake about that.
[1:11:43.660 --> 1:11:53.660]  So the more they talk about democracy, the less democracy we have, the more they talk about freedom, the less freedom we have.
[1:11:53.660 --> 1:11:59.660]  By the way, I hear you basically, for those that don't know, you experienced that you were there with Malcolm, but you're quoting Malcolm X right now.
[1:11:59.660 --> 1:12:10.660]  That's correct. I did have the opportunity to actually meet Malcolm. And of course, the reason they killed Malcolm X was Malcolm came to, shall I say, his realization.
[1:12:10.660 --> 1:12:19.660]  He evolved and said, you know what? It's not about a black-white thing. It's not about that. Malcolm had to kill. He had to die.
[1:12:19.660 --> 1:12:28.660]  You see, it was okay as long as he was mouthing and espousing, okay, hatred or yeah, disunity.
[1:12:28.660 --> 1:12:31.660]  But it's when you call for real unity, they come after you.
[1:12:31.660 --> 1:12:45.660]  That's when they come after you. And my brother, I want you personally to remember that because you're over the target. You are over the target, which is why you are receiving so much black.
[1:12:45.660 --> 1:12:56.660]  I remember a former, well, a former pilot with the Tuskegee Airmen, okay, who used the same example, okay, Dr. Harold Brown.
[1:12:56.660 --> 1:13:09.660]  All right. And you know, this is something we need to remember. Here we have a government today that is actually supporting the eyes of Neo-Nazi battalions of Ukraine.
[1:13:09.660 --> 1:13:18.660]  We got people over here who go to bed hungry, who are homeless, who have no hope, who are in despair.
[1:13:18.660 --> 1:13:21.660]  And $85 billion has been given to Ukraine.
[1:13:21.660 --> 1:13:33.660]  At least that's what we know of. That's only what we know of because the CIA has their own very private budget, which of course comes from taxpayer money.
[1:13:33.660 --> 1:13:44.660]  So I again, I just want you to know how very important you are. And I'm not blowing smoke. I don't have time for that nonsense.
[1:13:44.660 --> 1:13:47.660]  I'm trying to tell you, brother, you keep on keeping on.
[1:13:47.660 --> 1:13:52.660]  I appreciate the encouragement, brother. So continuing on, you were laying it out where we are right now.
[1:13:52.660 --> 1:14:05.660]  Where we are is at the crossroads. The crossroads of either regaining our republic, making it stronger and better, or losing everything.
[1:14:05.660 --> 1:14:17.660]  I suggest strongly that we will win, but at great cost, but we will win. So this is the crossroads. We are at a precipice.
[1:14:17.660 --> 1:14:23.660]  We are at a precipice. And we must back off from that precipice.
[1:14:23.660 --> 1:14:30.660]  Take control of our government. We the people have the Democrats forgotten that.
[1:14:30.660 --> 1:14:40.660]  Then again, have they ever remembered that? After all, it was John Wilk Booth, a Democrat who murdered, who assassinated Abraham Lincoln.
[1:14:40.660 --> 1:14:49.660]  But of course, Americans too many, not all, but too many Americans tend to be a historical, meaning simply they know nothing of history.
[1:14:49.660 --> 1:14:52.660]  They've been brainwashed. We've been brainwashed.
[1:14:52.660 --> 1:15:02.660]  But your job, our job is to make sure that we reawaken our strength and our power. And of this, brother, we are doing.
[1:15:02.660 --> 1:15:11.660]  I totally agree. Elaborate on why you think there's an awakening. I see it as well, not distributed worldwide, but it's happening.
[1:15:11.660 --> 1:15:28.660]  It's happening because the reality is that people are finally seriously beginning to say, wait a damn minute here. How can we send, as an example, 50-some billion dollars to some country thousands of miles away?
[1:15:28.660 --> 1:15:36.660]  How can we support neo-Nazis or supporting that government? How can we do that when we don't even have freedom here?
[1:15:36.660 --> 1:15:48.660]  Justice here, democracy here. I'm seeing it across the board. And I don't care about right, left, the Democrat, Republican, or Rhino-Republican, independent.
[1:15:48.660 --> 1:15:51.660]  People are awakening and it's happening.
[1:15:51.660 --> 1:16:07.660]  You're right. Larry Pinkney, stay there. We'll be back.

[1:20:08.660 --> 1:20:18.660]  One of the original founding members of the real Black Panther Party, Larry Pinkney joins us here tonight.
[1:20:18.660 --> 1:20:22.660]  You're hearing the real censored voices. They don't want you to hear.
[1:20:22.660 --> 1:20:34.660]  Larry, as we look at the world and what's happening in the establishment, collapsing in all the polls and nationalists and populists getting elected everywhere, they are really panicking right now.
[1:20:34.660 --> 1:20:45.660]  And I've got a hundred questions for you, but I want to give you the floor for points you want to make tonight about where this planet is and what you think the people should be doing right now.
[1:20:45.660 --> 1:21:05.660]  Well, first of all, let me, and thank you, my good brother. First of all, let me clarify something so that you or myself aren't attacked by some neoliberal fascist. I am a former editorial board member and columnist with the National Black Commentator, blackcommentator.com.
[1:21:05.660 --> 1:21:09.660]  Former, okay? Because I can just imagine somebody thinking.
[1:21:09.660 --> 1:21:18.660]  Send me a new bio. I got your old bio here. Yeah. Yeah. That's the old bio. Now, that's true. We've known each other for many years, haven't we, Alex?
[1:21:18.660 --> 1:21:29.660]  But anyway, let me talk a bit about what we could, should be doing and are doing, frankly.
[1:21:29.660 --> 1:21:42.660]  For one thing, I think that nationally and globally, but let's begin with America first. Nationally, we are pushing the globalist and they are globalists.
[1:21:42.660 --> 1:21:52.660]  People say, what do you mean by globalist? Well, basically what Dwight Eisenhower talked about, the industrial military, military industrial complex.
[1:21:52.660 --> 1:21:57.660]  What are you talking about by deep state? We're talking about what he was talking about then.
[1:21:57.660 --> 1:22:10.660]  That's a great point. Define globalist. I'll give you my definition, but they are multinational, fascistic, anti-freedom corporations, waging war against the grassroots, consolidating power.
[1:22:10.660 --> 1:22:26.660]  Exactly. I couldn't put it better myself. I mean, you summed it up. And it's simple. It doesn't take a rocket scientist, which I'm certainly not, to understand that that's who these globalists actually are.
[1:22:26.660 --> 1:22:38.660]  And it crosses all boundaries, including national boundaries. That's why they're trying to get rid of sovereignty, national sovereignty.
[1:22:38.660 --> 1:22:45.660]  You see? And you know that. And I'm sure that the vast majority of the audience of info wars knows that as well.
[1:22:45.660 --> 1:23:07.660]  But these globalists are serious. But we are too. We are also serious, very serious. But the thing that I keep in the back of my mind as we move towards November, towards the so-called election, please beware of any false flag event.
[1:23:07.660 --> 1:23:19.660]  This country, unfortunately, especially under this you ain't black if you don't vote for me, Joe Biden, is full of subterfuge. Subterfuge, all right?
[1:23:19.660 --> 1:23:32.660]  And so be aware. Be cognizant of what could lie ahead. Do not be fooled. Like their song used to go back in the day. Don't be fooled again.
[1:23:32.660 --> 1:23:48.660]  So this is one of the great concerns that I have. Also, I find it incredibly ironic that it is the United States, all right, just under the Biden regime, that is now breaking the back.
[1:23:48.660 --> 1:23:56.660]  Check this out. Breaking the back of Europe, particularly Western Europe, and especially Germany.
[1:23:56.660 --> 1:24:14.660]  Now, these are supposed to be allies? No, no. The name of the game is ultimate control, all right? And that's what the globalists are all about, control. It's not just here, but it begins here in this republic.
[1:24:14.660 --> 1:24:28.660]  And notice I keep saying republic, because this is a republic. And understand the implications of that. They don't talk about democracy. Well, first of all, they wouldn't know democracy if it slapped them in the face.
[1:24:28.660 --> 1:24:50.660]  And if they saw it, it would be abhorrent. They couldn't stand it. It would be abhorrent to them. So this is some of the things that are on my mind. We the people, black, white, brown, red, yellow, we are the ones who will bring about these changes.
[1:24:50.660 --> 1:25:06.660]  Not the psychotic, maniacal, lying, hypocritical pieces of whatever that, you know, too many people call leaders. There's a big difference between a leader and a misleading.
[1:25:06.660 --> 1:25:25.660]  And that's what these globalists are all about. Misleading, misinforming. Imagine, we are in the United States of America, and yet we are censored as if what? We are in Stalinist Russia, or Nazi Germany, of Bonito Mussolini's Italy.
[1:25:25.660 --> 1:25:38.660]  We are censored. All right, we are no longer allowed to put our perspectives out there. Why? Because it might actually get people to do what?
[1:25:38.660 --> 1:25:45.660]  And you're totally right, Larry. And as a benchmark, anybody surveilling you to censor you is the bad guy. That's just 101.
[1:25:45.660 --> 1:26:08.660]  Right, right. And it's funny that you mentioned not funny hilarious. It's interesting that you say 101, because we've gone from COINTELPRO, the counterintelligent COINTELPRO, C-O-I-N-T-E-L-P-R-O, okay, a program that was set up to frame, to imprison, to murder, et cetera, et cetera, by our own government.
[1:26:08.660 --> 1:26:18.660]  And now we got a big FBI whistleblower last week say they're using COINTELPRO against populists and patriots right now. They're literally targeting millions of Americans. It's like Venezuela.
[1:26:18.660 --> 1:26:40.660]  This is serious. And people, I think, are seeing that. It is serious. These people, people, creatures, whatever you want to call them, they will do anything, anything to try and maintain power, control, discredit you.
[1:26:40.660 --> 1:26:49.660]  Rather, that's what you're going through. They want to discredit you. But it's not going to work. It's not going to work.
[1:26:49.660 --> 1:26:58.660]  I totally agree with you, because they admit we're in a global food crisis and a global energy crisis. But on every record, they're the ones behind it.
[1:26:58.660 --> 1:27:15.660]  Exactly. Exactly. Who started the crisis? Why do we have this crisis? Because it's what they are doing. This is a part of their plan. See, keep you hungry enough, keep you cold enough, and then, whoa, you turn to them.
[1:27:15.660 --> 1:27:21.660]  What do you make of hundreds of food plants in Europe and the U.S. blown up? I mean, this is getting crazy.
[1:27:21.660 --> 1:27:31.660]  Common sense. Unfortunately, the media, as you well know, the so-called media, the propaganda machine, clamps down on that information. They do not connect the dots.
[1:27:31.660 --> 1:27:44.660]  That's where we come in. We connect the dots. And when one uses common sense to connect the dots, one knows that this is no coincidence. It's no coincidence.
[1:27:44.660 --> 1:27:56.660]  This is being deliberately, alright, and then insidiously carried out. So that's what I make of it. And I think that that's what all conscious people will make of it.
[1:27:56.660 --> 1:28:02.660]  No, I totally agree with that. And Larry, let me just throw this out there. We're going to break and come back and cover some world news, the food collapse, and what's happening in the third world.
[1:28:02.660 --> 1:28:09.660]  But I've been interviewing you for at least 20 years. And you were like me 20 years ago. You were not that positive. You were like, we're in trouble.
[1:28:09.660 --> 1:28:18.660]  So when you get up here, because you're a respected, really smart, wise guy, when you say you think we're starting to win, you're not just saying that to make other people up.
[1:28:18.660 --> 1:28:22.660]  So as bad as this is, you're seeing a big awakening.
[1:28:22.660 --> 1:28:35.660]  I'm seeing a big awakening because it's real. And guess what? The globalists know it's real. That's why they're clamping down so very hard. Well, keep on keeping on, because we are not about to quit.
[1:28:35.660 --> 1:28:43.660]  Larry, Larry, Larry, I got your old bio. Where is the best place for people to find you online if other folks want to interview you? How do people find Larry Pinkney?
[1:28:43.660 --> 1:28:56.660]  It is still there. The one part of the bio that's still quite active is the blackactivistwd.org. That's that's the blackactivistwg.org.

[1:31:57.660 --> 1:32:09.660]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalist. I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[1:32:09.660 --> 1:32:16.660]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war. But I don't deserve the credit.
[1:32:16.660 --> 1:32:28.660]  Yes, I've persevered. But the listeners and viewers who support Infowars are the real reason you've had the success. We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the global order you've ever had.
[1:32:28.660 --> 1:32:42.660]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon. And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify them.
[1:32:42.660 --> 1:32:51.660]  God bless you all. I salute you. I thank you. And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now, because we are over the target and this great is happening.
[1:32:51.660 --> 1:32:56.660]  The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight. God bless you all.
[1:32:56.660 --> 1:33:08.660]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:08.660 --> 1:33:22.660]  There's an old saying in Tennessee. I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee that says fool me once. Shame on you. It fooled me. We can't get fooled again.
[1:33:22.660 --> 1:33:31.660]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:33:31.660 --> 1:33:38.660]  The great Larry Pickney brought this up at blackactlesswg.org. Let's play a little bit of it.
[1:33:38.660 --> 1:33:44.660]  Roger Daltrey. What a musician. What a writer.
[1:33:44.660 --> 1:33:53.660]  Eat the new boss, sing as the old boss. Won't get fooled again.
[1:33:53.660 --> 1:33:59.660]  All right. We are so close to victory against the globalists right now.
[1:33:59.660 --> 1:34:05.660]  But they're cutting off the food. They're injecting us with poison. They're coming after us because they know we're waking up.
[1:34:05.660 --> 1:34:14.660]  We're getting popular selected everywhere. Here is Goya CEO, one of the biggest food companies in the U.S., explaining what's really going on.
[1:34:14.660 --> 1:34:19.660]  This is so powerful. It's what Larry Pickney was just talking about.
[1:34:19.660 --> 1:34:22.660]  Food prices, if you've been to the grocery store, you know, are continuing to climb.
[1:34:22.660 --> 1:34:29.660]  Political leaders like Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren say it's got nothing to do with the war in Europe or ESG or anything they did.
[1:34:29.660 --> 1:34:33.660]  It has to do with greedy grocers who are getting rich.
[1:34:33.660 --> 1:34:37.660]  I almost never speak to the heads of big companies on the show because they won't. Come on.
[1:34:37.660 --> 1:34:41.660]  But Bob Udanaway is the CEO of Goya Foods, one of the biggest food brands in the country.
[1:34:41.660 --> 1:34:46.660]  And we are grateful that he has been willing to join us tonight. Bob, thanks so much for coming on tonight.
[1:34:46.660 --> 1:34:53.660]  So you have heard, you run this huge company and you have heard that you're the reason that food prices are up. Is that true?
[1:34:53.660 --> 1:34:57.660]  Not true, Tucker. And thank you for your courage in speaking the truth.
[1:34:57.660 --> 1:35:04.660]  And I'd like to say our hearts, our prayers and our help because we are in Puerto Rico and Florida.
[1:35:04.660 --> 1:35:09.660]  Go out to the victims of Fiona and Ian.
[1:35:09.660 --> 1:35:16.660]  At the core of inflation and it's out of control, especially in food, is evil.
[1:35:16.660 --> 1:35:23.660]  Our desire to control us. When I was a child, my parents said, never take candy from a stranger.
[1:35:23.660 --> 1:35:27.660]  And they're giving out candy, incentivizing people not to work.
[1:35:27.660 --> 1:35:32.660]  They're taking away our purpose, our spirit, our reason to get up every day.
[1:35:32.660 --> 1:35:39.660]  And they're doing it without their own candy. They're taking our candy and using it to incentivize us not to work.
[1:35:39.660 --> 1:35:43.660]  That's very inflationary.
[1:35:43.660 --> 1:35:52.660]  I think you're the only person I've heard say that, that this is an intentional effort to take people's purpose for living away,
[1:35:52.660 --> 1:35:58.660]  which is work, the act of creation. That's why we're alive. Why does nobody say that?
[1:35:58.660 --> 1:36:04.660]  Well, you know, we were an essential business, Tucker. We never stopped working.
[1:36:04.660 --> 1:36:12.660]  But work is essential. It gives us our reason. You know, God, I love this gal from Maloney from Italy.
[1:36:12.660 --> 1:36:23.660]  She has this fascist speak, God, family, country. And, you know, you need to have a purpose. She says we all have our genetic code.
[1:36:23.660 --> 1:36:30.660]  Each one of us is made in likeness of God with our own identity. So we all have a purpose.
[1:36:30.660 --> 1:36:38.660]  Now you take that purpose away by the very few who want to own us, enslave us, control us for their own greed and power.
[1:36:38.660 --> 1:36:47.660]  We don't get through the game.
[1:36:47.660 --> 1:36:52.660]  They've been censoring Maloney's video everywhere where she said they want to end our families. They want to enslave us.
[1:36:52.660 --> 1:36:56.660]  They want to domesticate us. They want to make us dependent on them. That's totally true.
[1:36:56.660 --> 1:37:03.660]  What's been done to black Americans is the perfect example that the CIA ran and now they're going to do it to everybody.
[1:37:03.660 --> 1:37:08.660]  So Larry Pinkney, wow, here we are.
[1:37:08.660 --> 1:37:14.660]  Now they are doing it to everyone, my brother. And this is the thing. I'm sorry that it had to go full circle.
[1:37:14.660 --> 1:37:21.660]  But perhaps that's what it took. But that's where they made their mistake. They have made a serious mistake.
[1:37:21.660 --> 1:37:26.660]  It has gone full circle. It doesn't matter anymore whether you're black, white, brown, red, yellow.
[1:37:26.660 --> 1:37:34.660]  They want to destroy you, to control you. You either follow the narrative or they attack.
[1:37:34.660 --> 1:37:38.660]  Well, we got something real proper for them and it's very different.
[1:37:38.660 --> 1:37:42.660]  Our narrative is the narrative of everyday ordinary people.
[1:37:42.660 --> 1:37:48.660]  We understand. We don't need to use highfalutin, eloquent language. We speak the truth.
[1:37:48.660 --> 1:37:51.660]  That's one of the reasons they hate you, Alex, because you're very direct.
[1:37:51.660 --> 1:37:57.660]  That's one of the reasons they hate Trump. That's one of the reasons they hate DeSantis, because you all speak what?
[1:37:57.660 --> 1:38:02.660]  Very directly, very clearly, very down to earth. They hate that.
[1:38:02.660 --> 1:38:06.660]  They like to be like Barack Obama, Mr. Doublespeak, you dig?
[1:38:06.660 --> 1:38:13.660]  So it's like, enough of this. You are so correct. It's happening to us all right now.
[1:38:13.660 --> 1:38:19.660]  People must really become aware, cognizant, and they are.
[1:38:19.660 --> 1:38:22.660]  But we need to keep pushing, and pushing, and pushing.
[1:38:22.660 --> 1:38:27.660]  Like the song goes about a who we don't get fooled again.
[1:38:27.660 --> 1:38:33.660]  Larry, I can ask you to get a hundred questions, but just looking at the world, everything you see.
[1:38:33.660 --> 1:38:36.660]  I agree with you with 37 days left. They're going to do a false flag.
[1:38:36.660 --> 1:38:39.660]  FBI says, oh, right wing is about to blow stuff up.
[1:38:39.660 --> 1:38:46.660]  As a nationalist, as a populist, as a Christian, I'm not right wing or left wing. I'm pro-human.
[1:38:46.660 --> 1:38:49.660]  But they are demonizing everybody that's pro-America as a Nazi.
[1:38:49.660 --> 1:38:53.660]  When, as you pointed out, they're the real Nazis, and they make the Nazis blush.
[1:38:53.660 --> 1:38:56.660]  What do you expect to happen the next 37 days?
[1:38:56.660 --> 1:39:01.660]  Well, I wish I could say to be more specific.
[1:39:01.660 --> 1:39:07.660]  But I have a very strong suspicion, and I hope it just stays a suspicion,
[1:39:07.660 --> 1:39:14.660]  but a very strong suspicion that we're going to see some kind of major false flag event,
[1:39:14.660 --> 1:39:21.660]  which they will try to use to cripple any kind of real democratic process.
[1:39:21.660 --> 1:39:26.660]  Okay? I don't know what it's going to be, but I'll recognize it when I see it,
[1:39:26.660 --> 1:39:30.660]  and I think most of us will recognize it when we see it.
[1:39:30.660 --> 1:39:34.660]  If it happens, I hope it doesn't, but I expect them to try it.
[1:39:34.660 --> 1:39:40.660]  Well, people ask how I knew five, six months ago, and I went on air and I said,
[1:39:40.660 --> 1:39:44.660]  they're going to wind up crazy mentally ill white supremacists, and they're out there,
[1:39:44.660 --> 1:39:49.660]  on drugs, mentally ill, and they're going to attack, I would say, black grocery stores,
[1:39:49.660 --> 1:39:53.660]  black colleges, black churches, because we know they've provocative it before,
[1:39:53.660 --> 1:39:56.660]  because they're crazies, but they don't usually do it without help,
[1:39:56.660 --> 1:40:00.660]  just like we saw with Michigan and that whole fake plot, the same folks ran January 6th,
[1:40:00.660 --> 1:40:03.660]  and then that white supremacist went in and killed a bunch of innocent black people
[1:40:03.660 --> 1:40:07.660]  buying food for their family, and people are like, how did Jones know this?
[1:40:07.660 --> 1:40:10.660]  I mean, when you study this, you just learn the patterns,
[1:40:10.660 --> 1:40:12.660]  and that's what I'm really concerned about.
[1:40:12.660 --> 1:40:17.660]  I think they're going to, I'll bet you every ounce of blood in my body, every drop, Larry,
[1:40:17.660 --> 1:40:23.660]  they've got probably 20 white supremacist groups wind up, wound up, right now, ready to attack.
[1:40:23.660 --> 1:40:25.660]  I don't know how we stopped that.
[1:40:25.660 --> 1:40:29.660]  Isn't it very interesting that they constantly use the term white supremacist
[1:40:29.660 --> 1:40:37.660]  when they're supporting the other neo-Nazi white supremacist battalions of the Ukrainian government?
[1:40:37.660 --> 1:40:40.660]  Isn't that very interesting? Well, who are the Nazis?
[1:40:40.660 --> 1:40:44.660]  Who are the white supremacists? I'll tell you who. They are.
[1:40:44.660 --> 1:40:48.660]  By the way, we have the B-roll where they won't even, this is confirmed,
[1:40:48.660 --> 1:40:55.660]  they won't let Jews or anyone with brown skin into grocery stores in Nazi-controlled Ukraine,
[1:40:55.660 --> 1:41:01.660]  because they literally are Nazis. And remember, the puppet president Zelensky didn't deny that three months ago.
[1:41:01.660 --> 1:41:04.660]  He said they are what they are.
[1:41:04.660 --> 1:41:11.660]  What does that tell you? But who are we, when I say we, I mean the collective way, we are not,
[1:41:11.660 --> 1:41:16.660]  but who is our government supporting them to the tune of billion?
[1:41:16.660 --> 1:41:22.660]  They shouldn't get one cent. And you know, let's take care of America.
[1:41:22.660 --> 1:41:26.660]  Let's take care of the challenges and issues that we have right here.
[1:41:26.660 --> 1:41:32.660]  But see, that's the divide and conquer game. And you know it, brother, and our audience knows it.
[1:41:32.660 --> 1:41:39.660]  And we got to make damn sure that people all over this nation, all over this republic know it,
[1:41:39.660 --> 1:41:44.660]  so that when they try it, it will backfire big time.
[1:41:44.660 --> 1:41:46.660]  Well, you're right. And Larry, a month ago was 50 billion.
[1:41:46.660 --> 1:41:54.660]  It's currently 80 plus billion, as you said they admit to, pumped into Ukraine.
[1:41:54.660 --> 1:42:02.660]  Yes, yes. I mean, that's, it's not only insane.
[1:42:02.660 --> 1:42:11.660]  It's hard. I can finally, I can hardly find an adjective to describe how sick that is, how disgusting that is.
[1:42:11.660 --> 1:42:18.660]  Troop, veterans committing suicide, people starving, mass fentanyl death and 80 plus billion to Ukraine.
[1:42:18.660 --> 1:42:24.660]  And veteran families having to get food stamps, the families of veterans.
[1:42:24.660 --> 1:42:32.660]  Oh my God, this has got to be changed for all of us, black, white, brown, red, yellow, citizen of this republic.
[1:42:32.660 --> 1:42:34.660]  All right, Larry, everybody should visit your website.
[1:42:34.660 --> 1:42:44.660]  One more segment with you, blackactivistwg.org, blackactivistwg.org to see the censored information of Larry Pinckney.
[1:42:44.660 --> 1:42:50.660]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen. This is, this is just disgusting, but we got to remember we are starting to win.
[1:42:50.660 --> 1:42:56.660]  So as negative as it is, humanity's waking up. We'll be right back.
[1:42:56.660 --> 1:43:01.660]  Think about a world without info wars.
[1:43:01.660 --> 1:43:11.660]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together, this family that is info wars.
[1:43:11.660 --> 1:43:27.660]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[1:43:27.660 --> 1:43:37.660]  The only reason humanity's still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[1:43:37.660 --> 1:43:45.660]  I don't take the credit. I give you the credit. And now info wars is facing its darkest hours. It isn't going to give up.

[1:47:20.660 --> 1:47:34.660]  All right, but let's just be honest here. The left will attack and a lot of what they say is true, but their solutions are wrong.
[1:47:34.660 --> 1:47:38.660]  So I'm going to call some people out here right now. I'm going to call white people out.
[1:47:38.660 --> 1:47:45.660]  But not just white people, I'm going to call it anybody that's been successful, whether it's black, it doesn't matter, who now thinks they're part of the establishment.
[1:47:45.660 --> 1:47:50.660]  And I know all these white people and other people that know what's going on.
[1:47:50.660 --> 1:47:57.660]  And they think, well, you know, I'm making half million dollars a year, I'm doing whatever, I'm okay, I'm not going to worry about this.
[1:47:57.660 --> 1:48:05.660]  I'm separate from this fray. But what Larry Pinkney said 20 minutes ago is key. You're going to find out you're under attack.
[1:48:05.660 --> 1:48:10.660]  And so rejecting freedom and liberty is rejecting your birthright.
[1:48:10.660 --> 1:48:26.660]  And it's our defense shield, it's who we are. And so I want everybody, no matter what damn color your skin is, you got red blood to start getting into the fact that these basic truths of freedom are being destroyed.
[1:48:26.660 --> 1:48:37.660]  And if we don't have that safety and a freedom, we have nothing. But I know so many white people who aren't racist, they don't hate black people, they hate people that have less money than them.
[1:48:37.660 --> 1:48:42.660]  You know, I got to live in a neighborhood that's got a gate on it for security. And most of my neighbors are white.
[1:48:42.660 --> 1:48:50.660]  And they just don't like you if you're not rich. And it's an elitism where these people aren't part of the establishment.
[1:48:50.660 --> 1:48:59.660]  They need to promote liberty and freedom and not just think it's like some joke like, oh, there's this freedom thing over here and, you know, I'm rich, so I don't care about that.
[1:48:59.660 --> 1:49:12.660]  No, that is the ether, the sea in which we swim. That's what made us so great. So to know yourself and to know victory, you've got to embrace empowering everybody.
[1:49:12.660 --> 1:49:17.660]  That's what it's all about. And so I don't want to go off on some jag here, you know, about what's going on.
[1:49:17.660 --> 1:49:25.660]  But I don't think the average middle class person or wealthy person who's new or rich, whether they be black, brown, yellow, red, like you said, understands this.
[1:49:25.660 --> 1:49:32.660]  But if the globalists get their way, they're creating, Larry, a false class warfare against the middle class because they don't want that ecosystem.
[1:49:32.660 --> 1:49:34.660]  Can you speak to that?
[1:49:34.660 --> 1:49:44.660]  Absolutely. And I have to quite frankly say the same thing about so-called people of color. I say so-called because the white folks that I know, you can't see through them.
[1:49:44.660 --> 1:49:51.660]  They have some color, right? I think you have color. You have pigmentation, don't you? Anyway, all jokes aside, the reality is...
[1:49:51.660 --> 1:49:53.660]  I think I'm almost darker than you, Larry.
[1:49:53.660 --> 1:50:01.660]  I wouldn't doubt it. But you know, the fact of the matter is that I can say precisely what you said.
[1:50:01.660 --> 1:50:11.660]  Look at the, what I call, Negrotians in the Biden administration. Look at them. Look how they sold out every principle.
[1:50:11.660 --> 1:50:18.660]  Speak to that. They use blackness as a shield to push war and corrupt. And it's not black people doing it.
[1:50:18.660 --> 1:50:25.660]  We're black people. They've been bought out. It's disgusting. They're stealing black people's identity. Am I wrong?
[1:50:25.660 --> 1:50:32.660]  Well, of course you're correct. I mean, didn't Joe Biden say you ain't black if you don't vote for me?
[1:50:32.660 --> 1:50:39.660]  What's that if not trying to steal not only our very soul, our identity, everything?
[1:50:39.660 --> 1:50:46.660]  And the fact that he was allowed to get away with that, not just by black people, but by our republic.
[1:50:46.660 --> 1:50:50.660]  He literally said he owns black people.
[1:50:50.660 --> 1:50:55.660]  And he literally feels he does. And guess what, folks? That's what they want to do to others.
[1:50:55.660 --> 1:50:59.660]  And then Jill says to Hispanics or tacos.
[1:50:59.660 --> 1:51:07.660]  Yep. Yep. Yep. That's what they say, right? I mean, the bottom line, divide, conquer, control. Divide, conquer, control.
[1:51:07.660 --> 1:51:13.660]  And so I'm going to call out the Negrotians. That's what I call them. Yeah, you Negrotians, you traitors.
[1:51:13.660 --> 1:51:17.660]  Not only to black people, but you are traitors to the human race.
[1:51:17.660 --> 1:51:22.660]  And for that, you must pay. You must politically pay.
[1:51:22.660 --> 1:51:28.660]  So how do we counter the global corporate Klaus Schwab Nazis using black people as their corporate front?
[1:51:28.660 --> 1:51:31.660]  How do you call these folks out there doing it?
[1:51:31.660 --> 1:51:38.660]  Well, the only thing I can tell you, my good brother, is that I say it directly and I'm not afraid to say it.
[1:51:38.660 --> 1:51:49.660]  I tell them that they are dive, half-stepping, no good pieces of scum who will, they'd sell their mamas if they thought it would get them some cloth.
[1:51:49.660 --> 1:51:56.660]  They don't care. They're just like anybody else in terms of pigmentation. It doesn't matter.
[1:51:56.660 --> 1:52:03.660]  And being black is not just a color, as we used to say back in the 60s and 70s. It's a state of mind.
[1:52:03.660 --> 1:52:09.660]  Okay, so that's how I do it. I think all of us have our own unique ways of calling folks out.
[1:52:09.660 --> 1:52:16.660]  But for God's sake, call them out. Don't sit back and allow these people to get away with that.
[1:52:16.660 --> 1:52:23.660]  People like Kamala Harris, people like the press secretary, people like the so-called U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.
[1:52:23.660 --> 1:52:28.660]  These people are just pickable and they know it, but they don't care. Why?
[1:52:28.660 --> 1:52:35.660]  Because they get the money. They don't care about you, whether you're black, white, brown, red or yellow.
[1:52:35.660 --> 1:52:39.660]  They don't care. And we need to be real clear about that.
[1:52:39.660 --> 1:52:45.660]  Full-node punches. Malcolm didn't pull any punches and we're not going to pull any punches.
[1:52:45.660 --> 1:52:53.660]  And you know, that's why I call you a combination, Alex, of Paul Revere and Crispus Attic.
[1:52:53.660 --> 1:53:00.660]  Remember the top basketball player today. I'm not going to say his name. We all know his name.
[1:53:00.660 --> 1:53:08.660]  An amazing guy. You can admire him for his skill. Not as good as Michael Jordan, but almost.
[1:53:08.660 --> 1:53:12.660]  And he just said, remember two years ago, I don't care about Muslims. I don't care about Uyghurs.
[1:53:12.660 --> 1:53:19.660]  I don't care about China. And it's just like, it's so disgusting to watch that.
[1:53:19.660 --> 1:53:25.660]  And then have the owner of the warriors say, I don't care about slaves in China. We lose our humanity being like that.
[1:53:25.660 --> 1:53:30.660]  Yes, of course. Isn't that what, that's the game plan. That's the game plan.
[1:53:30.660 --> 1:53:39.660]  And that's why so-called people of color are so, they use them so effectively. Democrats in particular.
[1:53:39.660 --> 1:53:45.660]  All right. In particular. They're the only ones, but Democrats in particular. And let's be real.
[1:53:45.660 --> 1:53:51.660]  The Republicans are bad as well, but the Democrats are the best at evil. I mean, they are the thoroughbred.
[1:53:51.660 --> 1:53:54.660]  They are the deal.
[1:53:54.660 --> 1:54:01.660]  They are demonic. And they've been doing it for a very long time. As Lyndon Baines Johnson said.
[1:54:01.660 --> 1:54:06.660]  All right. And you can look it up. He would have these ends. And you know what I mean by ends.
[1:54:06.660 --> 1:54:11.660]  Voting Democrat for the next 200 years. All right. Democrat.
[1:54:11.660 --> 1:54:19.660]  We need to understand what we are real. In order to defeat an enemy, you must understand that enemy.
[1:54:19.660 --> 1:54:22.660]  You must understand how that enemy thinks, how that enemy-
[1:54:22.660 --> 1:54:28.660]  I agree. Does LeBron James not know how big he'd be if he'd empower humanity and come out against it?
[1:54:28.660 --> 1:54:30.660]  He just, why doesn't he do it?
[1:54:30.660 --> 1:54:40.660]  He doesn't care. Alex, he doesn't care. You have to, in order to do something for humanity, you have to first be human yourself.
[1:54:40.660 --> 1:54:45.660]  That's what you have to do. And he doesn't care. And it's not just him.
[1:54:45.660 --> 1:54:50.660]  Sadly, it's a whole bunch of Negrorians out there and so-called people of color.
[1:54:50.660 --> 1:55:00.660]  Be they, you know, black, brown, red, yellow, who are willing to sell out for 30 pieces of silver, blood money, because they don't care.
[1:55:00.660 --> 1:55:07.660]  So this is, let's face it. Let's be real. Stop shucking and jiving. Let's be real.
[1:55:07.660 --> 1:55:15.660]  And Lord knows, you know, like the book of James chapter 2, verse 26, faith without work is dead.
[1:55:15.660 --> 1:55:20.660]  So you better put your faith into action. That's what we all had better do.
[1:55:20.660 --> 1:55:25.660]  And these fools running around here, you know, making a mockery of us.
[1:55:25.660 --> 1:55:32.660]  I mean, you got the slave master sitting in the White House. The slave master, you ain't black if you don't vote for me. What?
[1:55:32.660 --> 1:55:38.660]  He told Judge Joe Brown to his face that he loves the KKK.
[1:55:38.660 --> 1:55:44.660]  Well, of course, look at who his friends are. Look into it. I mean, it doesn't matter.
[1:55:44.660 --> 1:55:47.660]  It's all a game of divide and conquer and control.
[1:55:47.660 --> 1:55:54.660]  But imagine that arrogance to sit there in a meeting with federal lawyers and Biden literally says, I love the KKK.
[1:55:54.660 --> 1:55:58.660]  I mean, it's a joke. It's sick.
[1:55:58.660 --> 1:56:02.660]  Yeah, it is sick. That's about the only thing I can say, but we're not sick.
[1:56:02.660 --> 1:56:09.660]  We're strong spiritually, mentally, and we are determined. They're the ones who are sick.
[1:56:09.660 --> 1:56:14.660]  They're losing. We're winning. We've just got to be focused and strong and expose the whole system.
[1:56:14.660 --> 1:56:21.660]  Larry Pinkney, amazing black activist, WG.org. We got one minute left. What else would you like to add, my friend?
[1:56:21.660 --> 1:56:26.660]  I want to give you my love. I want to give Owen Schroer my love. Owen, I love you, bro.
[1:56:26.660 --> 1:56:32.660]  I've seen you grow. I'm so proud of you. I want to give Darren McBrain and good brother, friend of mine, my love.
[1:56:32.660 --> 1:56:40.660]  I want to thank Daria, who made this interview possible and the whole crew of Infowars, all power to the people.
[1:56:40.660 --> 1:56:43.660]  You're going to make it real. You are making it real.
[1:56:43.660 --> 1:56:45.660]  I love you, Larry. Thank you so much, sir.
[1:56:45.660 --> 1:56:47.660]  Love you, brother.
[1:56:47.660 --> 1:56:51.660]  You know, when I die, I want to go to heaven. I want Larry to be there. I think he will be.
[1:56:51.660 --> 1:56:59.660]  If I'm good, I'll be there with him. Listen to this song. We're the survivors. We're the survivors.
[1:56:59.660 --> 1:57:04.660]  We've got to be the survivors. All we got to do is survive. We will.
[1:57:04.660 --> 1:57:07.660]  We're not running the planet. We're going to survive.
[1:57:07.660 --> 1:57:13.660]  Owen Schroer takes over in one minute.
[1:57:13.660 --> 1:57:18.660]  We're the survivors.
[1:57:18.660 --> 1:57:22.660]  We're the survivors.
[1:57:22.660 --> 1:57:26.660]  Yes, the black survivors.
[1:57:26.660 --> 1:57:30.660]  We're the survivors. A good man is never underneath.
[1:57:30.660 --> 1:57:34.660]  We're the survivors.
[1:57:34.660 --> 1:57:36.660]  Nothing changed. Nothing strange.
[1:57:36.660 --> 1:57:38.660]  We're the survivors.
[1:57:38.660 --> 1:57:40.660]  Nothing changed. Nothing changed.
[1:57:40.660 --> 1:57:43.660]  We're the survivors. We've got to survive.
[1:57:43.660 --> 1:57:46.660]  We've got to survive.
