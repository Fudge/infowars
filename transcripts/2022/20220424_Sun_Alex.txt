[00:00:03.664 --> 00:00:11.954]  It's Sunday, April 24th, 2022, and we are live in Defense of Liberty.
[00:00:12.054 --> 00:00:12.655]  InfoWars.
[00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:36.694]  InfoWars. Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:36.694 --> 00:00:39.975]   Thank you so much for joining us on this live Sunday broadcast.
[00:00:40.025 --> 00:00:44.027]  We have got an amazing transmission lined up for you today.
[00:00:44.707 --> 00:00:56.632]  Drew Hernandez is a great reporter, and he's got so many big topics and things he's personally eyewitnessed that he's going to be joining us about in the last segment of this hour and a little bit into the next hour.
[00:00:56.732 --> 00:01:02.435]  And then during the 40-hour Moneybomb Emergency Broadcast, which I thank everybody for tuning into and supporting.
[00:01:02.455 --> 00:01:02.995]  You're amazing.
[00:01:03.555 --> 00:01:05.216]  Your fighting spirit is incredible.
[00:01:06.036 --> 00:01:06.817]  I had Robert Barnes on.
[00:01:06.837 --> 00:01:10.060]  He hadn't been on in about three months because he's been so busy with cases and things he's doing.
[00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.042]  He was on fire.
[00:01:12.242 --> 00:01:14.384]  Everybody in the studio said it after he was gone.
[00:01:15.413 --> 00:01:16.854]  I got calls from all over.
[00:01:16.874 --> 00:01:20.197]  I mean, he just was dead on an hour-long interview.
[00:01:20.657 --> 00:01:25.340]  So I'm going to air 30 minutes of it in the second hour just to get people hooked.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.561]  You'll go to Bandot Video.
[00:01:26.801 --> 00:01:27.442]  It's free there.
[00:01:27.882 --> 00:01:30.063]  And share the daylights out of the interview.
[00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:31.424]  It is very important.
[00:01:31.464 --> 00:01:35.547]  Robert Barnes, the left, is running scared, attempting to trigger civil war.
[00:01:35.868 --> 00:01:36.768]  And that's a fact.
[00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:40.051]  That is absolutely going on.
[00:01:40.956 --> 00:01:46.300]  But you can see that when we probably put out 50 videos Friday and Saturday, that's a glut of videos.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.824]  Usually you don't have a bunch of videos get more than 50,000 views when we put out that many videos because there's hundreds of them.
[00:01:53.505 --> 00:01:58.949]  The Barnes video, no promotion, 300 plus thousand views just since it went up yesterday.
[00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.412]  I called up on the weekend crew and I said, that's a pretty hot interview.
[00:02:03.452 --> 00:02:05.534]  You should cut it out and post it.
[00:02:05.554 --> 00:02:06.735]  They went, phew!
[00:02:07.915 --> 00:02:08.456]  Powerful.
[00:02:08.576 --> 00:02:09.277]  I'm not hyping it.
[00:02:09.358 --> 00:02:09.999]  It's powerful.
[00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:10.840]  It's just dead on.
[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:11.682]  Machine gun on.
[00:02:11.842 --> 00:02:13.385]  Everything he says is just nailed.
[00:02:13.565 --> 00:02:13.926]  Nailed.
[00:02:15.228 --> 00:02:15.589]  Nailed.
[00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:18.133]  So... Amazing.
[00:02:18.233 --> 00:02:19.415]  Definitely bringing his A-game.
[00:02:19.455 --> 00:02:20.317]  He's always smart, but he...
[00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.291]  Blue me away.
[00:02:22.631 --> 00:02:22.971]  Friday.
[00:02:23.591 --> 00:02:26.894]  Amazing job of the crew working 40 hours straight in the money bomb.
[00:02:26.934 --> 00:02:34.338]  We did bring in a million dollars between Thursday, Friday into Saturday and reached our goal Saturday evening.
[00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:35.979]  And I want to thank you all.
[00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:38.481]  Now, again, most of that's product sales, so it's really about $500,000.
[00:02:39.082 --> 00:02:47.627]  But that will take us over the edge we need to be able to buy supplements and other products in the future to then sell and have money to operate.
[00:02:47.647 --> 00:02:53.144]   So our underage is now about a million and a half dollars and hopefully if I work
[00:02:53.144 --> 00:02:57.263]   hard and get some sponsors and stuff the next month I'm just gonna I'm gonna go forward like we're
[00:02:57.263 --> 00:03:02.084]   not gonna lay people off and and implode because again I could stop ordering product and
[00:03:02.084 --> 00:03:07.653]   operate great for six, seven, eight, nine months but then once the product's all sold out
[00:03:07.653 --> 00:03:09.153]  we are we are insolvent.
[00:03:09.386 --> 00:03:11.508]  So we're up against the globalists.
[00:03:11.528 --> 00:03:12.409]  We're toe-to-toe with them.
[00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:13.850]  I appreciate you keeping us in the fight.
[00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.091]  We're in this together.
[00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:16.712]  They are trying to get through me to get to you.
[00:03:17.053 --> 00:03:18.734]  When Trump says that, he's absolutely right.
[00:03:19.114 --> 00:03:31.744]  And when he said this last night at a packed rally, he was also dead on that Biden is being given orders and led around by the Easter Bunny at multiple events, doesn't know who he is, and is shaking hands with the air.
[00:03:31.884 --> 00:03:32.225]  Here it is.
[00:03:33.021 --> 00:03:39.544]  And we have a president right now, sadly, who has absolutely no idea what the hell is happening.
[00:03:42.546 --> 00:03:44.266]  He's shaking hands with the air.
[00:03:45.627 --> 00:03:49.689]  He's walking around somewhat bewildered.
[00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.630]  I'd say it's no good.
[00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.271]  And taking orders from the Easter Bunny.
[00:03:54.311 --> 00:03:54.971]  You saw that one?
[00:03:55.031 --> 00:03:55.672]  No, no, no.
[00:03:57.281 --> 00:04:02.263]  You know, I always joke around and say, oh, and the Easter Bunny's gonna drop by and make jokes about the Easter Bunny.
[00:04:02.283 --> 00:04:04.244]  Like, global warming's real and so is the Easter Bunny.
[00:04:04.284 --> 00:04:10.246]  But literally, he takes orders from everybody because he is in deep dementia.
[00:04:10.287 --> 00:04:15.549]  And this was done by design so the globalists can blame him for their agenda and so they never get in trouble for it.
[00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.351]  All right, I have gotten really prepared for this broadcast.
[00:04:20.892 --> 00:04:25.374]  We've also got some really positive fun stuff happening in the fight for liberty.
[00:04:26.014 --> 00:04:28.716]  Mike Tyson has been being very supportive of the broadcast.
[00:04:29.696 --> 00:04:31.657]  So has Tucker Carlson with Savannah Hernandez.
[00:04:31.717 --> 00:04:32.598]  And why is that important?
[00:04:33.878 --> 00:04:41.671]   If the left can demonize me and make everybody turn on me, They can get everybody to turn on America, because I am a symbol to the globalists of America, of you.
[00:04:42.071 --> 00:04:42.851]  It's just, it's true.
[00:04:43.452 --> 00:04:49.453]  They see me as the populist they hate, and the loud, Texan, Second Amendment Christian, who never backs down.
[00:04:49.933 --> 00:04:58.035]  And they are just dedicated to destroying me, but it's actually causing the reverse, and has turned the broadcast into a folk hero operation, and it's really exploding right now.
[00:04:59.035 --> 00:05:05.137]  We have a president that has to be led around by the nose, like he is a near-terminal Alzheimer patient.
[00:05:06.001 --> 00:05:11.025]  And who shakes hands with the air, and who takes orders from the Easter Bunny.
[00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:19.210]  America's enemies worked very, very hard to put this puppet in power, and now they're planning a civil war to end the Republic as we know it.
[00:05:19.271 --> 00:05:23.433]  But, humanity is awakening, and we still have time to stop it.
[00:05:23.914 --> 00:05:25.195]  Here is our real president.
[00:05:26.144 --> 00:05:28.084]  He's done some things I don't like, but boy do I love him.
[00:05:28.125 --> 00:05:28.825]  Boy is he funny.
[00:05:29.345 --> 00:05:30.805]  Just telling it like it is.
[00:05:30.825 --> 00:05:37.707]  And of course, this information is being censored off of every major platform because we're not allowed to hear from our former president.
[00:05:38.047 --> 00:05:41.148]  He's supposed to be banned and taken off the air like InfoWars is.
[00:05:41.468 --> 00:05:42.088]  Here is Trump.
[00:05:43.088 --> 00:05:49.590]  And we have a president right now, sadly, who has absolutely no idea what the hell is happening.
[00:05:52.591 --> 00:05:54.251]  He's shaking hands with the air.
[00:05:55.672 --> 00:05:59.696]  He's walking around somewhat bewildered.
[00:06:00.236 --> 00:06:04.340]  I'd say it's no good and taking orders from the Easter Bunny.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.001]  You saw that one?
[00:06:05.041 --> 00:06:05.842]  No, no, no.
[00:06:07.744 --> 00:06:11.868]  And here's the point I've been making really hard lately because other people don't seem to be making it.
[00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:14.450]  It's fun to make fun of Biden.
[00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:15.911]  It's fun to make fun of the left.
[00:06:16.412 --> 00:06:19.114]  Except they're run by the big corporations and are kicking our ass.
[00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:21.327]  They're running circles around us.
[00:06:21.367 --> 00:06:22.368]  They're stealing elections.
[00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:29.215]  They're trying to disqualify anybody from running for office that questions elections, when that is the duty and right of every American.
[00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:35.321]  And we send the State Department around all over the world to monitor other people's elections that are much more open and fair than ours.
[00:06:36.474 --> 00:06:37.515]  It's stunning.
[00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:41.980]  Speaking of that, Frances Macron wins reelection, dodges political earthquake.
[00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.061]  I don't believe that for a minute.
[00:06:43.442 --> 00:06:46.786]  Famous election fraud over there in France.
[00:06:47.226 --> 00:06:51.531]  Yeah, they've gone to paper ballots, but they're still tabulated at a central center.
[00:06:51.551 --> 00:06:52.832]  She was way ahead in all the polls.
[00:06:53.925 --> 00:06:55.827]  But of course, lost.
[00:06:56.127 --> 00:07:03.295]  But in areas where conservatives have been able to maintain control, where the left's never gotten control, magically she won in a landslide.
[00:07:03.796 --> 00:07:12.826]  Once the left gets control, whether it's in France, or whether it's in Germany, or whether it's in the UK or Canada or the US, they never relinquish control.
[00:07:12.846 --> 00:07:15.389]  And you wonder why things get so bad.
[00:07:16.721 --> 00:07:21.025]  Well, it's because they're engaged in total fraud and know that no one can ever remove them.
[00:07:21.526 --> 00:07:29.873]  Macron won by 58.8%, we're told, and Le Pen by 41.2%, despite even the scientific polls showing her winning.
[00:07:30.334 --> 00:07:31.355]  So, there you go.
[00:07:31.515 --> 00:07:33.437]  I don't buy it for a single second.
[00:07:33.757 --> 00:07:34.898]  Oh, but I'm evil.
[00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:37.120]  That's a sign of terrorism.
[00:07:37.681 --> 00:07:41.364]  But, oh, Democrat lawyers have been going around the country.
[00:07:42.285 --> 00:07:47.732]  Trying to ban anyone from office, as I said earlier, if they questioned the elections.
[00:07:47.852 --> 00:07:53.859]  Even though the Democrats promised that if they thought Trump had won, they would never accept it and have their quote, own inauguration.
[00:07:54.642 --> 00:08:00.665]  Judge dismisses lawsuits trying to bar Representative Paul Goeser and Andy Biggs from running for re-election.
[00:08:00.745 --> 00:08:14.051]  But it's going forward because they picked the right Democrat-controlled judge in Georgia, and they're very close to barring Marjorie Taylor Greene from running for office, who won by over 70% landslide.
[00:08:16.394 --> 00:08:17.835]  Because she's so popular, they fear her.
[00:08:18.575 --> 00:08:23.979]  So, oh, she thinks that we're trying to stop the will of the voter, so you can't vote for who you want.
[00:08:24.219 --> 00:08:28.201]  Doing exactly what she says they're doing.
[00:08:28.301 --> 00:08:31.904]  I mean, it's just preposterous that that is going on.
[00:08:31.924 --> 00:08:37.967]  And we've got a great reporter, Drew Hernandez, joining us coming up a little bit later in the hour to talk about that.
[00:08:38.468 --> 00:08:40.289]  And then a bunch of videos he's put together.
[00:08:40.869 --> 00:08:43.411]  Now, there's more than 20 of these, and I'm not going to play them all.
[00:08:43.951 --> 00:08:45.372]  We're going to play two or three of them.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:51.343]  School teachers saying, we're grooming your children and we're going to teach them how to be lesbians.
[00:08:52.003 --> 00:08:53.945]  And we're going to teach them how to have sex with each other.
[00:08:54.385 --> 00:08:55.286]  This is pedophilia.
[00:08:55.406 --> 00:08:56.607]  This is pedo talk.
[00:08:56.647 --> 00:08:58.808]  And they say, we know your kids are online.
[00:08:59.548 --> 00:09:02.831]  We don't care that it's your fault.
[00:09:02.851 --> 00:09:04.552]  You didn't keep them from us, so we're going to get them.
[00:09:05.372 --> 00:09:08.995]  And when you turn your children over to these public schools and things, this is what happens.
[00:09:09.555 --> 00:09:15.039]  This has happened to people in Austin, very close to me, that have children.
[00:09:16.257 --> 00:09:28.407]  Who put them in a mainline, nice, upper-end public school, the Eames School District, the richest school district in Texas, and their 10-year-olds came back and said, I'm a lesbian.
[00:09:28.887 --> 00:09:32.370]  And they target little girls and teach them this, and now that they like girls.
[00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:35.232]  I mean, you are talking about un...
[00:09:35.928 --> 00:09:40.727]   believable stuff. And they're not just inducting them to be attracted to girls.
[00:09:40.727 --> 00:09:46.408]   Because that in anthropology, sociology, psychology, most women that have at one
[00:09:46.408 --> 00:09:49.728]   or point are attracted to girls and that there's some physiology to that. But then
[00:09:49.728 --> 00:09:53.447]   of course they are more attracted to males. And that goes back to you know the
[00:09:53.447 --> 00:09:56.288]   men are off for a long time away when the women are back at home. I mean let's
[00:09:56.288 --> 00:10:00.127]   just get honest about women's psychology. But they're indoctrinating them into a
[00:10:00.127 --> 00:10:03.288]   whole leftist system and they're doing it not when they're adult women but when
[00:10:04.024 --> 00:10:04.664]  That's grooming.
[00:10:05.365 --> 00:10:10.588]  And it's specifically into the whole LGBT cult, and they're saying, parents, you can't stop us.
[00:10:10.928 --> 00:10:13.530]  Your kids belong to us, just like the San Francisco Choir did.
[00:10:13.911 --> 00:10:18.654]  So, that is coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:20.899 --> 00:10:29.085]  In the second hour, a lot of big developments with January 6th and the rollout of that and how the left wants to start a martial law.
[00:10:29.525 --> 00:10:33.588]  We're going to be laying that out and their plan and how we can peacefully stop it.
[00:10:34.429 --> 00:10:35.990]  We have Senator Orrin Hatch dying.
[00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:37.131]  I'll get some into that.
[00:10:37.171 --> 00:10:42.675]  We've got Elon Musk really endearing himself to me more and more, going after Bill Gates in a hilarious way.
[00:10:43.396 --> 00:10:45.517]  We have just got so much to hit on the COVID-19 front.
[00:10:47.138 --> 00:10:49.099]  And on the collapse of the border.
[00:10:49.139 --> 00:10:53.080]  In fact, that's really the most important thing front and center right now.
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:58.942]  And we're going to hit that in the next segment.
[00:10:58.982 --> 00:10:59.902]  But just think about that.
[00:11:01.843 --> 00:11:05.004]  You have the third world starving to death because of two years of lockdowns.
[00:11:05.024 --> 00:11:07.885]  The IMF and World Bank ordered two years of lockdowns in most other countries.
[00:11:08.525 --> 00:11:09.745]  You have major food shortages.
[00:11:10.266 --> 00:11:11.546]  Hundreds of millions set to starve to death.
[00:11:11.586 --> 00:11:12.626]  Tens of millions have already died.
[00:11:14.007 --> 00:11:19.400]   And then now With the world food chain delivery system.
[00:11:21.246 --> 00:11:28.129]  Breaking down, they now say hundreds of millions are headed towards Europe and North America, currently, in the next five years.
[00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:31.691]  Tens of millions a year, you already see that, and here it is.
[00:11:31.951 --> 00:11:36.413]  ICE prepares for a surge of migrants as Title 42 draws to a close.
[00:11:36.753 --> 00:11:40.615]  They will not check if a man is with little kids to see if the dad or a woman is with little kids.
[00:11:40.875 --> 00:11:43.316]  They will not check for medical to see if you have any diseases.
[00:11:43.836 --> 00:11:45.037]  They are just going to release you 100%.
[00:11:45.357 --> 00:11:49.759]  This has already been going on, but now, no TB test, no nothing.
[00:11:50.299 --> 00:11:54.763]  But, oh, you need to take all these deadly COVID shots or you can't go to your work or your job.
[00:11:55.063 --> 00:11:56.164]  This is unbelievable.
[00:11:56.564 --> 00:11:57.885]  Collapse of the country.
[00:11:59.326 --> 00:12:00.607]  Can't do a medical check on people.
[00:12:00.628 --> 00:12:01.628]  They're just going to turn loose.
[00:12:01.768 --> 00:12:08.434]  But, federal court orders first gender affirming surgery for transgender prisoner.
[00:12:08.454 --> 00:12:18.222]  If women just have men saying they're women getting women pregnant in prison from New Jersey to California, they now are going to get taxpayers to pay to have their penises and testicles cut off.
[00:12:19.508 --> 00:12:24.370]  So, this is unbelievable time to be alive.
[00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:27.751]  And really what that is, is making things sterilized, fashionable.
[00:12:28.291 --> 00:12:37.515]  And so a lot of folks will say, hey, like the sheriff out in Florida said, hey, we love it when you shoot burglars because we don't have to spend time and money putting them in jail and the president paying for them.
[00:12:38.515 --> 00:12:40.016]  And I get what he's saying, okay?
[00:12:40.756 --> 00:12:42.277]  And hey, you got these prisoners in there?
[00:12:44.386 --> 00:12:45.067]  Go ahead.
[00:12:45.848 --> 00:12:49.131]  Opt him in to have their genitals cut off so they don't produce anymore.
[00:12:49.912 --> 00:12:53.295]  But it's going to end up being everybody, ladies and gentlemen, and it sets a dangerous precedent.
[00:12:53.716 --> 00:12:59.442]  And sure, if you can get some whack job to have his testicles cut off, who's like a rapist, that's great in prison.
[00:12:59.622 --> 00:13:00.683]  And if he opts in, good.
[00:13:00.743 --> 00:13:01.264]  Cut him off.
[00:13:01.845 --> 00:13:02.886]  I mean, it's a free world.
[00:13:04.587 --> 00:13:04.768]  But...
[00:13:05.964 --> 00:13:21.069]  They're targeting four-year-olds in this country and in England to tell them that they need to sign up, and then the state takes over, controls the child, takes control of the decision-making process, and removes the parental relationship completely, and then wrecks that child psychologically.
[00:13:21.149 --> 00:13:24.450]  So that is satanic, massive criminal abuse.
[00:13:25.071 --> 00:13:25.991]  And it's completely wrong.
[00:13:26.811 --> 00:13:31.069]   And so, what you let be done to the prisoners, Even though you're kind of like me, I bet.
[00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:32.150]  Well, yeah, screw them.
[00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:32.551]  Let them do it.
[00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:34.733]  It's going to end up being all of us.
[00:13:34.753 --> 00:13:35.773]  And that's how evil works.
[00:13:35.854 --> 00:13:38.716]  It tricks you to cut corners because, oh, well, they deserve it.
[00:13:39.096 --> 00:13:43.460]  And then once that new process is gone and once this sick stuff is in place, it's everybody.
[00:13:43.761 --> 00:13:44.541]  And we're in big trouble.
[00:13:44.902 --> 00:13:47.124]  Speaking of that, I mean, imagine just reading this headline.
[00:13:47.724 --> 00:13:47.924]  L.A.
[00:13:47.984 --> 00:13:50.747]  Times, New York Times are all promoting it like it's no big deal.
[00:13:52.193 --> 00:13:52.953]  Here's Town Hall.
[00:13:53.293 --> 00:13:57.635]  With California looking to legalize infanticide, pro-lifers are resisting.
[00:13:57.955 --> 00:14:07.158]  I mean, can you even believe that we're in a world with headlines like that and that states like New York passed laws where you can keep a baby alive and kill it?
[00:14:10.973 --> 00:14:12.274]  That's what this is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:12.294 --> 00:14:15.515]  I mean, these people are out of control, but they have a plan.
[00:14:15.915 --> 00:14:18.617]  We have to be aware of their plan and stand up and say no.
[00:14:18.637 --> 00:14:21.538]  We've got some big, great reset news as well today.
[00:14:21.918 --> 00:14:24.760]  Davos Group news, Bill Gates news, it's all coming up.
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.041]  InfoWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[00:14:27.061 --> 00:14:28.621]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:14:28.661 --> 00:14:30.462]  Without you, we would be shut down.
[00:14:30.863 --> 00:14:34.124]  Your support of InfoWars is true defiance of tyranny.
[00:14:34.884 --> 00:14:37.526]  Thank you so much for standing with us, and we stand with you.
[00:14:38.527 --> 00:14:39.548]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:14:39.928 --> 00:14:41.128]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:14:42.309 --> 00:15:04.240]  I'm going to talk in the next segment about the keys to victory and the fact that more and more people like Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Marjorie Taylor Greene and Savannah Hernandez and so many other people get, and that if we get this as Christians and conservatives and as populists and as nationalists or just people that are common sense and don't want to be slaves, it's game over.
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.581]  The system has collapsed.
[00:15:07.483 --> 00:15:08.783]  It knows everybody's done with it.
[00:15:09.624 --> 00:15:24.368]  It knows it's in deep trouble and they know they're all going to go to prison for what they've done unless they can trigger worldwide collapse and make us all kill each other so they can pose as the savior over crises so horrible we forget about all the crimes they've committed.
[00:15:24.628 --> 00:15:32.991]  The good news is we're here on air during all of this and you're out there spreading the word despite all their censorship so people know worldwide it's the new world order.
[00:15:34.482 --> 00:15:56.632]  But it's life and death to expose them so that what they're carrying out will be lessened and will be mitigated and will be dealt with and will be stopped in many cases and then they all are destroyed by their actions instead of them executing this collapse and these many civil wars and all the rest of it and having us be too stupid to figure out what they've done.
[00:15:56.652 --> 00:15:58.413]  You see, they're arrogant.
[00:15:58.853 --> 00:16:01.835]  They think because the public's asleep, they're stupid.
[00:16:02.722 --> 00:16:07.367]  And I found people are really smart, but they're selfish, and in a trance-like state.
[00:16:07.928 --> 00:16:09.850]  The sleeper must awaken.
[00:16:10.851 --> 00:16:13.494]  You must be reborn, Christ says.
[00:16:14.094 --> 00:16:24.365]  And I'm telling you, once you shift, and once you have the Holy Spirit, it leads, guides, and directs you, and then your understanding of how the world works will become exponential.
[00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:27.071]  And it's the most incredible voyage ever.
[00:16:27.091 --> 00:16:28.812]  And I know most of you are already on that voyage.
[00:16:29.172 --> 00:16:29.832]  It's why you're here.
[00:16:29.932 --> 00:16:32.734]  Some of you more advanced than I am, but it is incredible.
[00:16:34.015 --> 00:16:50.743]  By the way, I'm gonna hit this big news on the border first, and I'm not ready to talk about this because I've been asked to by some very, very smart people, but they agree it needs to go public and it will in the next week and a half, probably the next week.
[00:16:53.665 --> 00:16:59.514]   But The Justice Department is not even hiding it.
[00:16:59.974 --> 00:17:01.675]  They're meddling in my court cases.
[00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:03.495]  Federal and state.
[00:17:04.296 --> 00:17:12.319]  We have sworn witnesses and their own emails and the thing is, they're so mad dog now, they're not even hiding it.
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:24.925]  So you wonder how I'm defaulted and how I don't get to face my accusers and how I don't get to speak at these kangaroo trials or you see the Justice Department involved in Jones's bankruptcy.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:34.547]  I'm not going to talk about it yet, but I will, and it is something that retired judges, federal judges, people have never seen.
[00:17:34.567 --> 00:17:37.850]  I mean, their mouths are hanging open.
[00:17:40.432 --> 00:17:41.353]  Hanging open.
[00:17:43.534 --> 00:17:44.475]  Oh, and they're not intimidated.
[00:17:45.977 --> 00:17:50.921]  See, there comes a point with the pushing of the authoritarians where people go, oh my God, you're right about everything.
[00:17:50.941 --> 00:17:51.842]  What the hell's going on here?
[00:17:54.278 --> 00:17:54.598]  Hello!
[00:17:54.618 --> 00:17:56.240]  Oh, hi, I'm from the Justice Department.
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.622]  We will overcome Alex Jones.
[00:17:58.662 --> 00:18:00.844]  This is a quote, and you will not help him.
[00:18:00.864 --> 00:18:01.485]  What do you mean?
[00:18:01.665 --> 00:18:02.485]  We will not help him?
[00:18:02.505 --> 00:18:03.967]  He doesn't have access to federal courts?
[00:18:04.027 --> 00:18:04.828]  I'm gonna stop.
[00:18:04.988 --> 00:18:05.368]  I'm gonna stop.
[00:18:05.408 --> 00:18:05.969]  I'm already going there.
[00:18:08.411 --> 00:18:09.812]  I mean, I'm not even scared by this.
[00:18:09.892 --> 00:18:10.953]  I'm scared for everybody.
[00:18:11.213 --> 00:18:12.595]  This is crazy!
[00:18:15.973 --> 00:18:21.516]  But they're all in their own bubble up there, getting away with Hunter Biden and the Chinese spies and the cocaine.
[00:18:21.556 --> 00:18:25.137]  And they're all just, just think they can do anything.
[00:18:25.718 --> 00:18:26.258]  And you know what?
[00:18:26.097 --> 00:18:38.177]   what if we let him we will be the new big Ponderosa version of Venezuela. But
[00:18:38.177 --> 00:18:41.978]  God help this country.
[00:18:41.085 --> 00:18:47.489]   I mean, I mean, I can't even believe the stuff they do.
[00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:50.291]  Because obviously you know the rest of the equation.
[00:18:50.311 --> 00:18:51.412]  I haven't told you one-tenth of it.
[00:18:51.772 --> 00:19:01.898]  But on its face, folks, the executive branch contacting the legislative or the judicial branch and telling them to do things is not legal.
[00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:08.482]  But everything these people are doing, I mean, I have L.A.
[00:19:08.522 --> 00:19:11.804]  Times saying, well, what's wrong with killing babies up to seven weeks?
[00:19:12.145 --> 00:19:13.866]  Hell, some people are saying up to three months.
[00:19:16.513 --> 00:19:19.015]  We show you a man on the street interviews with Mark Dice.
[00:19:19.055 --> 00:19:19.795]  He didn't edit those.
[00:19:19.835 --> 00:19:21.096]  I mean, he just cut the spaces out.
[00:19:21.576 --> 00:19:26.079]  He talked to like 40 people and almost all of them said, yeah, let's kill babies up to a year old or 10 months.
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:48.110]   These people, just because they have authority like Nero or Caligula or Stalin or Hitler or Fidel Castro or Mao Zedong or Genghis Khan, They just think that they are allowed to do whatever they want, however they want, whenever they want.
[00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:54.715]  And it is, it's, it's when you come face to face with that, you're like, wow, we really are two minutes to midnight.
[00:19:56.816 --> 00:19:57.957]  I mean, we really are screwed.
[00:19:59.056 --> 00:19:59.556]  But you know what?
[00:19:59.636 --> 00:20:04.458]  We brought it on ourselves, being asleep, putting up with being pushed around, the rest of it.
[00:20:04.698 --> 00:20:08.139]  And I want to just explain this slowly, because I know our general audience gets it.
[00:20:08.379 --> 00:20:11.741]  We're on over 300 radio stations and over 100 cable and TV stations.
[00:20:12.401 --> 00:20:13.882]  And new people are tuning through all the time.
[00:20:13.902 --> 00:20:15.142]  They're saying, what are you talking about?
[00:20:15.162 --> 00:20:21.224]  You understand the IMF and World Bank control almost all of Africa, almost all of Latin America, almost all of Asia and the Middle East.
[00:20:23.225 --> 00:20:24.445]  You can count on two hands.
[00:20:24.506 --> 00:20:25.546]  Countries aren't controlled by them.
[00:20:26.046 --> 00:20:28.247]  And the Great Reset is about Western countries going under it.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:46.792]  Bankrupting use you got to go into debt when you cut the food off and cut people's jobs off in third world countries where if on average they go above 50% of their other income for food they die and Then war breaks out riots.
[00:20:46.893 --> 00:20:54.074]   It's a known fact that Well, already more than half the world's at about 60% of their paycheck is for food.
[00:20:54.894 --> 00:20:55.995]  Artificially cutting it off.
[00:20:56.536 --> 00:21:04.423]  What do you think happens when they collapse Latin America and the Middle East and areas of Asia and Africa?
[00:21:04.723 --> 00:21:07.586]  Those people flood and it's the able-bodied men that can do it.
[00:21:08.086 --> 00:21:09.206]  They get organized at U.N.
[00:21:09.226 --> 00:21:17.410]  camps for three to six months, brainwashed, giving blank credit cards, giving contacts, and then they're sent into Europe, they're sent to the U.S., and they never get jobs.
[00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:23.272]  They're on welfare, but they become these private political armies and underclasses of the globalists.
[00:21:23.612 --> 00:21:30.074]  And then you see this, where there's a law that, okay, well, we at least, even if we're going to release somebody, we've got to make sure they have a kidnapped kids.
[00:21:30.775 --> 00:21:36.477]  We've got to make sure they don't have tuberculosis or scabies or, you know, any of these other horrible things, hemorrhagic fever.
[00:21:37.415 --> 00:21:39.957]  Because, I mean, there's really a lot of deaths in the third world if you didn't know.
[00:21:40.157 --> 00:21:46.281]  Go hang out in a third world slum in India or Latin America and see how sick you get.
[00:21:46.321 --> 00:21:47.061]  I mean, it's bad.
[00:21:47.862 --> 00:21:48.122]  Okay?
[00:21:48.422 --> 00:21:51.724]  Civilization and hygiene and running water is not everywhere.
[00:21:52.545 --> 00:21:54.986]  We used to be just as bad a hundred and something years ago until we got running water.
[00:21:55.226 --> 00:21:57.388]  That's what really cleaned things up, not the vaccines, all the studies show.
[00:21:59.252 --> 00:22:04.318]  So you do that and you don't even, okay, you're a man, you're a woman with five kids.
[00:22:04.338 --> 00:22:07.701]  We're not going to even look at your IDs and we're not going to stick a thermometer in your mouth.
[00:22:08.022 --> 00:22:09.283]  We're not going to even give you medicine.
[00:22:09.303 --> 00:22:11.705]  Just get on buses and planes, you're into the U.S.
[00:22:12.546 --> 00:22:16.751]  Well, we're all micromanaged and told we've got to test you to get on a plane.
[00:22:16.771 --> 00:22:18.012]  We've got to test you to have a job.
[00:22:18.253 --> 00:22:20.375]  We've got to make you take all these experimental shots to do anything.
[00:22:20.615 --> 00:22:21.735]  We've got to have all your records.
[00:22:21.875 --> 00:22:31.657]  Oh, we got all the... Wow, they just flood us with these third-world populations who are exempt from the shots and the mask, because under liability internationally, that's cruel and unusual to make somebody take a shot or a mask.
[00:22:31.877 --> 00:22:37.379]  The UN won't even do its own dirty work and says we're worried about the shot, while they're the ones ordering it worldwide.
[00:22:39.739 --> 00:22:44.620]  So, imagine, no medical testing, no checking of IDs, no nothing.
[00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:46.401]  You can just come in.
[00:22:46.581 --> 00:22:48.201]  And it's already been like that since Biden got in.
[00:22:50.704 --> 00:22:55.064]   ICE prepares for a surge of migrants as Title 42 draws to close.
[00:22:55.064 --> 00:22:58.064]  That is just unbelievable.
[00:22:58.064 --> 00:23:02.865]   So they're not going to do that, but don't worry, you're going to pay for sex changes,
[00:23:02.865 --> 00:23:07.223]   which is really just mutilation and sterilization of the presence.
[00:23:07.853 --> 00:23:09.473]  I mean, this is serious business.
[00:23:09.493 --> 00:23:11.354]  All right, we got some really good news.
[00:23:11.374 --> 00:23:13.274]  When we come back, we have the keys to victory.
[00:23:13.314 --> 00:23:13.735]  Stay with us.
[00:23:14.455 --> 00:23:23.757]  So, I get attacked conservatively over 100 times a day in major newspapers and TV stations, both local and national, not just counting farm ones.
[00:23:23.797 --> 00:23:24.778]  I can't even keep track of it.
[00:23:25.338 --> 00:23:32.540]  Some days it's 5,000 TV stations or more, because you can do Google Alerts and get the numbers sent to you.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.783]  Oh, I have 5,000 today.
[00:23:34.863 --> 00:23:35.644]  Oh, I have 1,000 today.
[00:23:35.724 --> 00:23:37.147]  Oh, I only have 100 today.
[00:23:37.648 --> 00:23:40.512]  Sometimes I get the Google Alerts, only have 75.
[00:23:41.193 --> 00:23:42.275]  It never drops below that.
[00:23:43.496 --> 00:23:48.541]  All lies, all garbage, just criminal, savage gaslighting of the American people.
[00:23:48.861 --> 00:23:54.267]  And again, why under Trump, because he's attacked more than I am, why am I so attacked?
[00:23:54.307 --> 00:23:58.110]  Because I'm seen as a populist, as a real person that cares about people.
[00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:07.900]  I'm not perfect, but I tell the truth, and I love everybody, and I want justice, and I want prosperity, and I don't want infanticide of seven-day-old babies as California's trying to pass a law.
[00:24:09.116 --> 00:24:13.897]  And so they can't have anybody challenging their uncommon sense with our common sense.
[00:24:13.937 --> 00:24:16.038]  So, I've talked about this a lot.
[00:24:17.438 --> 00:24:18.959]  Dinosaur Media is collapsing.
[00:24:19.019 --> 00:24:21.920]  Not just Netflix, not just CNN+, not just CNN.
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.320]  All of it is collapsing.
[00:24:24.701 --> 00:24:29.182]  And we're led by a guy that gets orders from the Easter Bunny.
[00:24:30.666 --> 00:24:31.787]  As Trump said last night.
[00:24:32.188 --> 00:24:50.406]  And so what people need to understand is, when you see Tucker Carlson almost every week say Alex Jones was right, Alex Jones is good, or you see Mike Tyson say it, or Joe Rogan say it, or other people say it, they're saying it because they know the system's created me as a symbol of the populace being bad.
[00:24:51.354 --> 00:24:55.758]  And if they simply go along with that, they too will be destroyed.
[00:24:56.159 --> 00:25:00.743]  So Infowars is like a Roman standard that the foreign armies are trying to capture and get.
[00:25:00.783 --> 00:25:01.564]  That's what I'm trying to tell you.
[00:25:01.944 --> 00:25:09.050]  I don't, quite frankly, like being this important and have been chosen by the enemy for destruction, but it's because you chose me for leadership.
[00:25:09.671 --> 00:25:12.033]  So I don't care about being famous, powerful, any of that.
[00:25:12.173 --> 00:25:16.617]  I care about winning and persevering and not backing down.
[00:25:17.594 --> 00:25:18.595]  That's why I can't do it without you.
[00:25:19.056 --> 00:25:22.981]  So it's so nice to have Mike Tyson come out and say nice things and talk about human sacrifice.
[00:25:23.001 --> 00:25:26.005]  Now I'm right about that on Joe Rogan, and he's really a smart guy now.
[00:25:26.045 --> 00:25:28.868]  He's transcended and really, as you say, born again.
[00:25:28.888 --> 00:25:31.191]  I don't mean as Christian, but just a new person.
[00:25:32.113 --> 00:25:34.956]  And then you've also got, you know, he is somewhat Christian, I would say.
[00:25:35.777 --> 00:25:45.386]  Then you've got all these other people like Tucker Carlson talking about Infowars, promoting it, because they understand that that's a symbol of populism and something the enemy's trying to destroy.
[00:25:45.726 --> 00:25:55.976]  And by countervailing that, it shows the world it's an intimidation, it's a hoax, it's a fraud, that we should all stop being intimidated by the mouse that roared mainstream media.
[00:25:55.996 --> 00:26:01.861]   But the on average 75-year-old member of Congress or the Senate Still believes it's all-powerful, and is still scared of it.
[00:26:02.121 --> 00:26:05.504]  So as long as we're scared of the man behind the curtain, they have power over us.
[00:26:05.844 --> 00:26:12.408]  So here's Savannah, first giving us a shout-out after the show, but also they're visiting Tucker in his studios in Florida.
[00:26:12.969 --> 00:26:15.010]  And then we'll go to the actual piece they had.
[00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:16.772]  Then we've got Mike Tyson on Joe Rogan.
[00:26:16.792 --> 00:26:17.092]  Here it is.
[00:26:18.703 --> 00:26:20.945]  Hi Alex, just wanted to send you a quick hello.
[00:26:21.045 --> 00:26:21.746]  Oh, Alex!
[00:26:21.786 --> 00:26:25.449]  We were literally just slobbering all over you on camera.
[00:26:25.849 --> 00:26:27.050]  Alex Jones, he's so wonderful.
[00:26:27.091 --> 00:26:27.871]  How wonderful is he?
[00:26:28.031 --> 00:26:28.752]  We love Alex.
[00:26:29.813 --> 00:26:30.874]  And it was heartfelt, too.
[00:26:32.435 --> 00:26:32.916]  Interesting.
[00:26:33.076 --> 00:26:34.117]  What'd you think of Alex Jones?
[00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:35.390]  Loved him to death.
[00:26:35.771 --> 00:26:36.952]  I still talk to him to this day.
[00:26:36.972 --> 00:26:43.956]  I think that he's great and I think that many more people should have been vocal when he was initially banned.
[00:26:43.976 --> 00:26:44.476]  I agree.
[00:26:44.657 --> 00:26:45.917]  Because I was actually there.
[00:26:45.998 --> 00:26:47.559]  I was on a fishing trip that day.
[00:26:47.579 --> 00:26:48.239]  Yeah.
[00:26:48.399 --> 00:26:52.442]  I was in Labrador and I've regretted it ever since that I didn't come out of the box.
[00:26:52.562 --> 00:26:53.162]  I wasn't there.
[00:26:53.182 --> 00:26:54.303]  I was off the air.
[00:26:54.423 --> 00:26:55.964]  But I completely agree.
[00:26:56.044 --> 00:26:57.545]  It was not even about Alex Jones.
[00:26:57.585 --> 00:27:00.207]  It's about you can't censor people, period.
[00:27:00.507 --> 00:27:01.067]  Exactly.
[00:27:01.087 --> 00:27:03.449]  And Tucker, I remember the exact day when he got censored.
[00:27:03.529 --> 00:27:09.311]  I woke up and I looked on my phone and it said, Alex Jones banned from YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter.
[00:27:09.352 --> 00:27:10.392]  He was banned everywhere.
[00:27:10.452 --> 00:27:13.754]  It was a mass banning, mass censorship effort to silence him.
[00:27:13.774 --> 00:27:21.858]  And again, I really didn't have an introduction into politics, but I had learned a lot of, you know, things from Alex Jones up front.
[00:27:22.438 --> 00:27:24.641]  Everything that he was telling me was not false.
[00:27:24.681 --> 00:27:29.466]  The people who condemn him and say that he's a crazy conspiracy theorist do not listen to his show every single day.
[00:27:29.766 --> 00:27:31.288]  Because I worked for him for two and a half years.
[00:27:31.368 --> 00:27:34.111]  I didn't know the three branches of government when I started.
[00:27:34.451 --> 00:27:40.278]  Now I can tell you international policy and what's going on all over the world right now because I have listened to Alex.
[00:27:40.718 --> 00:27:49.925]  And he's talked about, you know, the government corruption historically that we've been through, all of the different operations such as Operation Mockingbird, Operation Paperclip, a lot of these things.
[00:27:49.945 --> 00:27:55.870]  The Tuskegee Experiment, which is why, you know, the black community is so apprehensive for vaccinations in the modern day.
[00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:59.293]  He talks about a lot of these things and our government doesn't like that.
[00:27:59.353 --> 00:28:01.054]  Our government doesn't like being exposed.
[00:28:01.074 --> 00:28:05.458]  They don't like people who are willing to tell the truth and people who are willing to push back against the narrative.
[00:28:05.718 --> 00:28:13.727]   Look at the The fact that the DHS just updated their bulletin to say, hey, if you're spreading distrust in the government, that could be considered terrorism.
[00:28:13.747 --> 00:28:15.369]  I don't think so.
[00:28:15.389 --> 00:28:20.615]  I couldn't, of course, agree with you more, but I'm fascinated by the hate for Alex Jones.
[00:28:20.675 --> 00:28:22.598]  I'm not a daily Alex Jones viewer.
[00:28:22.798 --> 00:28:24.420]  I don't view anything regularly, actually.
[00:28:25.762 --> 00:28:27.303]  I think Alex Jones seems really talented.
[00:28:27.543 --> 00:28:28.384]  He's smart.
[00:28:28.644 --> 00:28:30.045]  He's funny as hell.
[00:28:30.065 --> 00:28:31.065]  He's truly funny.
[00:28:31.085 --> 00:28:33.467]  He's a lot more talented than I am in a lot of ways.
[00:28:33.707 --> 00:28:35.388]  That's my takeaway from Alex Jones.
[00:28:36.109 --> 00:28:37.570]  But why is he such a threat?
[00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:39.111]  Like, why would you hate Alex Jones?
[00:28:39.151 --> 00:28:40.131]  I've never understood that.
[00:28:40.371 --> 00:28:41.772]  Because he's telling the truth, Tucker.
[00:28:41.832 --> 00:28:45.735]  And again, I know Alex personally, and I've met a lot of people in this industry.
[00:28:46.175 --> 00:28:51.999]  And one of my biggest takeaways is that there are a lot of people, especially in conservative media, that are in this for money and fame.
[00:28:52.019 --> 00:28:53.580]  They don't actually care about this country.
[00:28:53.619 --> 00:28:55.459]  and they don't actually care about America.
[00:28:55.459 --> 00:28:56.978]  They're scared about being censored.
[00:28:56.978 --> 00:29:00.418]   They're scared about, you know, hurting the wrong people's feelings, not getting the proper
[00:29:00.418 --> 00:29:01.418]  endorsement.
[00:29:01.418 --> 00:29:02.419]  Alex doesn't care about any of that.
[00:29:02.419 --> 00:29:03.538]  Alex cares about the truth.
[00:29:03.538 --> 00:29:04.659]  He has since day one.
[00:29:04.659 --> 00:29:08.298]   He has made mistakes for sure, but he comes out, he apologizes for it, and he corrects
[00:29:08.298 --> 00:29:12.539]   the record, which is something that many people in our media refuse to do.
[00:29:12.924 --> 00:29:17.331]  The people who hate Alex Jones hate him because he is everything that they wish that they could be.
[00:29:17.371 --> 00:29:23.259]  Somebody who is willing to tell the truth, willing to fight for this country, and actually cares about humanity.
[00:29:23.299 --> 00:29:25.102]  Not just America, but humanity as a whole.
[00:29:25.362 --> 00:29:41.049]  Yeah, he owns his own company and he has no advertisers, so he's kind of immune, really, and the only way to stop him is by destroying him with lawsuits for giving his opinion, which I guess is now a crime or something in the United States, so they're trying to do it that way.
[00:29:41.429 --> 00:29:50.033]  I couldn't agree with you more, and why do you think, I've already said why I didn't defend Alex Jones the day he was deplatformed, but I wasn't in the country.
[00:29:50.988 --> 00:29:56.711]  But why do you think that more in conservative media didn't take a principle stand against censorship when that happened?
[00:29:57.131 --> 00:29:58.732]  Because Alex was off-limits.
[00:29:58.772 --> 00:30:05.735]  Look at the fact that right now, Tucker, so many in conservative media who wouldn't even mention Alex Jones's name now say his name on a regular basis.
[00:30:05.815 --> 00:30:06.836]  Oh, Alex Jones is right.
[00:30:06.916 --> 00:30:07.676]  Alex Jones is right.
[00:30:07.977 --> 00:30:09.437]  We see this constantly, okay?
[00:30:09.597 --> 00:30:18.622]  The people in the conservative media, or in the right-wing even, will not latch onto a specific narrative or tell the truth until it goes mainstream and they're allowed to do it.
[00:30:19.222 --> 00:30:31.085]  Even in the conservative and the right-wing faction, the reason why we lose is because we continue to wait for the left, the liberal media, the mainstream media, to allow us, to tell us when we are allowed to tell the truth.
[00:30:31.665 --> 00:30:34.126]  Alex did that initially from day one.
[00:30:34.326 --> 00:30:41.288]  So, I mean, I think that's why conservatives didn't stand up for him when they should have because they weren't allowed to at the time.
[00:30:41.824 --> 00:30:44.925]  I couldn't agree more, but she's got to take a stand against censorship, I think.
[00:30:45.165 --> 00:30:46.306]  Especially if you're in the media.
[00:30:47.046 --> 00:30:48.367]  I find Joy Reid loathsome.
[00:30:48.407 --> 00:30:50.387]  I think she's a race hater, and she spreads race hate.
[00:30:50.527 --> 00:30:57.950]  However, if the government pushed for her to be censored, I would defend Joy Reid without even thinking about it, because I'm against that.
[00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:58.550]  Period.
[00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:59.351]  I don't care who it is.
[00:30:59.951 --> 00:31:00.431]  Period.
[00:31:01.071 --> 00:31:03.752]  And I don't know why National Review can't take that stand.
[00:31:03.933 --> 00:31:04.953]  I think it's very, very odd.
[00:31:05.362 --> 00:31:09.764]  Listen, I know we don't like Alex Jones and stuff, but... Listen, check this out, right?
[00:31:10.125 --> 00:31:10.785]  Well, I like him.
[00:31:10.805 --> 00:31:11.926]  I know people don't know, but listen.
[00:31:12.506 --> 00:31:17.409]  Whatever you think... Whatever you think a human did to another human being, it happened.
[00:31:17.889 --> 00:31:18.569]  Yes.
[00:31:18.629 --> 00:31:21.611]  Anything, I don't know, whatever it is, it happened.
[00:31:21.651 --> 00:31:23.192]  Somewhere in history it definitely happened?
[00:31:23.232 --> 00:31:24.733]  It probably happened somewhere this year.
[00:31:24.753 --> 00:31:24.813]  Yes.
[00:31:25.293 --> 00:31:27.975]  And sometimes in these special camps and stuff it happens.
[00:31:28.255 --> 00:31:34.680]  These people own these thousands of acres and nothing grows on them and just... Right.
[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:37.542]  Weird ranches where people meet and do rituals.
[00:31:37.562 --> 00:31:39.544]  Might want to hunt a motherfucker and let him go.
[00:31:39.564 --> 00:31:41.766]  That's not outside the realm of possibility.
[00:31:41.806 --> 00:31:43.327]  I know that's why I'm throwing it at you.
[00:31:43.347 --> 00:31:48.551]  I guarantee you there's been someone somewhere in the world who paid someone to hunt a person.
[00:31:49.766 --> 00:31:51.028]  I guarantee you that's happening.
[00:31:51.088 --> 00:31:51.468]  Listen, no.
[00:31:51.608 --> 00:31:52.309]  This is what happened.
[00:31:52.329 --> 00:32:02.877]  They take these homeless people off the streets, put them in there, take them to one of these special hospitals, they take them from that hospital, they may have them drugged up, take them to one of these large estates of property.
[00:32:03.618 --> 00:32:04.098]  That's hot.
[00:32:04.599 --> 00:32:05.800]  Jesus Christ.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:06.280]  Run.
[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:06.740]  Run.
[00:32:08.442 --> 00:32:08.822]  No, really.
[00:32:08.862 --> 00:32:10.504]  I really believe that.
[00:32:10.704 --> 00:32:14.727]  I think, well, that book, The Most Dangerous Game, didn't that come out in like the 30s?
[00:32:16.305 --> 00:32:19.286]  It's an old, old book about that very, very thing.
[00:32:19.406 --> 00:32:20.666]  Rich people hunting poor people.
[00:32:20.706 --> 00:32:23.767]  The only reason we hunt the... Why is the only reason we hunt fox?
[00:32:25.147 --> 00:32:26.347]  I think there's their fur.
[00:32:27.688 --> 00:32:29.788]  The fox is the only one that backtracks.
[00:32:30.268 --> 00:32:31.169]  Oh, because it's sneaky.
[00:32:31.189 --> 00:32:32.909]  He's the only one that backtracks.
[00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:37.370]  If he chases, if he chases, he'll go forward and then come backwards and go this way.
[00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:37.970]  To trick you.
[00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:38.430]  Yeah.
[00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:43.471]  That's why that's the only really challenging... That's the only challenging chase.
[00:32:43.792 --> 00:32:44.972]  Everything else is too easy.
[00:32:45.692 --> 00:32:46.613]  It's too simple-minded.
[00:32:46.633 --> 00:32:48.274]  The fox is the only one that's challenging.
[00:32:48.674 --> 00:32:49.975]  Oh, that's interesting.
[00:32:50.235 --> 00:32:51.436]  I never thought about it that way.
[00:32:51.456 --> 00:32:54.639]  And so now they say, well, the fox is the most reasonable animal.
[00:32:54.979 --> 00:32:57.681]  Let's try a human animal, see how reasonable he is.
[00:32:59.315 --> 00:32:59.835]  Guaranteed.
[00:33:00.615 --> 00:33:03.056]  Guaranteed someone's done that.
[00:33:03.076 --> 00:33:05.437]  They want to challenge reason, reasonability.
[00:33:06.077 --> 00:33:07.098]  Let's see how he thinks.
[00:33:07.238 --> 00:33:09.619]  How does he think, how is he superior than us?
[00:33:10.259 --> 00:33:10.839]  Why are we superior?
[00:33:10.859 --> 00:33:14.240]  They're not going to do anything they think that's inferior than them.
[00:33:15.121 --> 00:33:19.402]  They're going to study what they're going to attack, or what they're going to make their victim.
[00:33:22.303 --> 00:33:24.104]  For sure, people have done that, right?
[00:33:25.765 --> 00:33:26.806]  That's insane.
[00:33:26.846 --> 00:33:27.466]  Cyclopia.
[00:33:28.067 --> 00:33:29.688]  Wow, I always thought that was a myth.
[00:33:30.229 --> 00:33:32.010]  I never knew that there was an actual disease.
[00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:33.892]  You're talking to me when you're talking about this.
[00:33:33.912 --> 00:33:34.452]  I know!
[00:33:34.472 --> 00:33:37.054]  I'm like Alex Jones in ancient times.
[00:33:37.374 --> 00:33:38.956]  Can you make that a little bit bigger, Jamie?
[00:33:39.336 --> 00:33:39.696]  Right there?
[00:33:39.836 --> 00:33:40.037]  Yeah.
[00:33:40.117 --> 00:33:44.160]  Cyclopia is derived from the Greek word Cyclops, meaning ring-eyed.
[00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:52.105]   It's a rare condition that causes a child to be born with one eye, no nose, And a proboscis, a nose-like growth above the eye.
[00:33:52.145 --> 00:33:53.485]  Brother, I need to hit listen.
[00:33:53.505 --> 00:33:53.885]  There you go.
[00:33:54.105 --> 00:33:54.966]  I'm telling you, nigga.
[00:33:55.146 --> 00:33:58.967]  However, it isn't that a baby has one eye.
[00:33:59.147 --> 00:34:03.028]  It's a severe malformation of the baby's brain early in the pregnancy.
[00:34:03.848 --> 00:34:04.528]  Oh, wow.
[00:34:04.628 --> 00:34:08.349]  So both of the... Cyclopia often results in a miscarriage or stillbirth.
[00:34:08.709 --> 00:34:11.350]  Survival after birth is mostly a matter of a few hours.
[00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:16.872]  Doctors also call it holoprosynthophilia.
[00:34:18.692 --> 00:34:27.200]  So imagine, say 10,000 years, 100,000 years ago, maybe they did something where they were able to be accepted into the world.
[00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:28.161]  I don't know.
[00:34:28.261 --> 00:34:31.204]  It says there's no way to prevent it and there's no cure.
[00:34:32.099 --> 00:34:36.483]  When we hired Savannah four years ago, and she was here for three years, she was smart right out of college.
[00:34:36.883 --> 00:34:38.925]  But man, she is going to be a force to be reckoned with.
[00:34:38.945 --> 00:34:42.848]  She is already as articulate as myself or Tucker Carlson is.
[00:34:42.888 --> 00:34:48.352]  And Tucker, I would say, for the genuineness and the charming and the great brain, he's better than me in many ways.
[00:34:48.372 --> 00:34:53.476]  That was a nice compliment, you know, he gave me there saying that he's, you know, that I'm, quote, better on air than him.
[00:34:53.496 --> 00:34:54.017]  That's not true.
[00:34:55.191 --> 00:35:01.013]  The issue is we're all different and that's how God made us, but together we make the world really an amazing place when good people stand up.
[00:35:01.033 --> 00:35:04.814]  But people should take that four-minute clip that's on InfoWars.com.
[00:35:04.834 --> 00:35:07.195]  I don't think it's even on InfoWars.com.
[00:35:07.215 --> 00:35:19.480]  We never promote ourselves, but I'll get an article out tomorrow or I'll have that clip posted under the live show feed with today's show title that's on InfoWars so you can see it and share it because she totally gets it.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:20.940]  We're all intimidated.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.181]  We let the left make the rules.
[00:35:22.641 --> 00:35:27.888]   We get In line, hoping they don't censor us and it's all Pavlovian dog training.
[00:35:28.969 --> 00:35:32.012]  The more you give in, the worse it gets.
[00:35:32.612 --> 00:35:35.755]  And if we all just start saying what we want and doing what we want...
[00:35:37.082 --> 00:35:40.466]  And not being intimidated by these people, we're going to win.
[00:35:40.486 --> 00:35:41.367]  We've got to be smart about it.
[00:35:41.387 --> 00:35:42.107]  We've got to tell the truth.
[00:35:42.548 --> 00:35:45.231]  But we've got to stop bowing and groveling to these people.
[00:35:45.611 --> 00:35:47.573]  I didn't get to the Mike Tyson, Joe Rogan club.
[00:35:47.953 --> 00:35:49.135]  And I've got Drew Hernandez coming up.
[00:35:49.155 --> 00:35:51.077]  But I'll get that posted on the side as well.
[00:35:51.137 --> 00:35:54.100]  And once we post this to the archive, I'll have it added in post.
[00:35:54.701 --> 00:35:56.002]  And who knows, I might get to it next hour.
[00:35:56.022 --> 00:35:59.325]  But Mike Tyson said, you're not supposed to like Alex Jones, but I love him.
[00:36:00.006 --> 00:36:03.429]  That's what they're scared of, and people get that to the revolutionaries.
[00:36:03.749 --> 00:36:06.311]  They want to shut Alex Jones down because they want to shut you down.
[00:36:06.671 --> 00:36:08.012]  It's key to supporting full force.
[00:36:08.813 --> 00:36:09.974]  It's Sunday, April 24, 2022.
[00:36:10.894 --> 00:36:13.176]  We're not supposed to be on air right now.
[00:36:14.077 --> 00:36:24.165]  Everybody's supposed to be silenced by big globalist corporations led by BlackRock and Vanguard gaslight us all and say that they're going to have a sexual relationship with your children.
[00:36:25.282 --> 00:36:27.242]  They're going to have pregnant men emojis.
[00:36:27.262 --> 00:36:30.343]  They're going to open our borders up and not do any medical checks.
[00:36:30.363 --> 00:36:32.463]  But you're going to do a medical check to get on a bus or a plane.
[00:36:33.103 --> 00:36:38.844]  Yeah, it's a criminal takeover to see what you'll put up with, to see what these monsters can get away with.
[00:36:39.345 --> 00:36:41.525]  And they are attacking our free speech everywhere.
[00:36:41.545 --> 00:36:43.005]  They're not just trying to shut InfoWars down.
[00:36:43.405 --> 00:36:43.725]  Look at this.
[00:36:43.785 --> 00:36:47.666]  Twitter bans ads that contradict science on climate change.
[00:36:48.106 --> 00:36:52.367]  The definition of science is that anybody can challenge it and that anybody can question it.
[00:36:53.362 --> 00:37:02.389]  If it's so strong that carbon dioxide is a deadly gas that kills everything, and that's not true, it's a life-giving gas, then why don't they just let you challenge?
[00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:07.593]  They don't let you challenge that two men can have a baby on Twitter or Instagram.
[00:37:07.913 --> 00:37:09.014]  Because it's a lie.
[00:37:09.435 --> 00:37:10.576]  Because it's a fraud.
[00:37:11.296 --> 00:37:17.281]  And now Judge dismisses lawsuit trying to bar Representative Paul Goeser and Andy Biggs from running for re-election.
[00:37:17.641 --> 00:37:22.365]  But it's going forward in Georgia against MTG, and I saw the clip.
[00:37:23.544 --> 00:37:29.889]  Where they say to her, why did you call Pelosi a traitor?
[00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:34.312]  Oh, and I was like, ooooh.
[00:37:34.332 --> 00:37:37.654]  They're like, you should be barred from running because you're a traitor.
[00:37:37.975 --> 00:37:43.579]  Pelosi and the Democrats called for physically attacking Republicans and said burning down cities is mostly peaceful.
[00:37:44.159 --> 00:37:46.120]  I mean, yes, the Democrats are traitors.
[00:37:46.201 --> 00:37:50.584]  Yes, Biden having secret meetings with Communist Chinese leaders.
[00:37:52.366 --> 00:37:56.132]  With his father in the White House, now mainstream news is big news.
[00:37:56.392 --> 00:37:57.654]  Yeah, that's what traitors are.
[00:37:57.955 --> 00:38:02.161]  Dianne Feinstein having her offices run by a known Chinese agent.
[00:38:02.462 --> 00:38:05.066]  Swallow's Well being penetrated by a Chinese agent.
[00:38:05.306 --> 00:38:06.047]  We know that!
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:20.766]  But oh, we're the traitors for calling them traitors, and now we have to be banned from running from office because Marjorie Taylor Greene said they want to stop voters' will.
[00:38:20.786 --> 00:38:22.567]  And they're like, we'll show you.
[00:38:22.967 --> 00:38:24.648]  You can't say we want to steal elections.
[00:38:24.708 --> 00:38:25.748]  You're not allowed to run.
[00:38:26.069 --> 00:38:26.969]  You're too popular.
[00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:30.091]  Wow, what an attempt at power, but why not?
[00:38:30.111 --> 00:38:34.473]  They're passing bills everywhere to kill babies for weeks or months after they're born.
[00:38:35.737 --> 00:38:37.718]  I mean, there's no bottom to these people.
[00:38:38.078 --> 00:38:45.503]  Drew Hernandez is on a whole bunch of platforms, reporter for a lot of big outfits, Drew H Live on Twitter, DrewHLive.com.
[00:38:45.843 --> 00:38:50.846]  He's an investigative reporter, commentator, and host of Frontline, Andrew Hernandez Live, a good friend of mine.
[00:38:50.886 --> 00:38:57.810]  He's got a lot to talk about today on the pedo grooming gangs next hour and more ahead of Robert Barnes and a powerful interview coming up.
[00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:06.819]   But front and center, this attempt The oxymoronic move that if you say we're trying to not let you elect people, you can't run for office.
[00:39:06.859 --> 00:39:10.743]  I mean, it's just, it's like saying, are you saying I'm a murderer?
[00:39:10.944 --> 00:39:12.025]  Of course I murder people.
[00:39:12.045 --> 00:39:13.206]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[00:39:13.226 --> 00:39:13.827]  What do you say to that?
[00:39:15.788 --> 00:39:16.968]  I think it's pretty clear, Alex.
[00:39:17.108 --> 00:39:30.753]  I think we're seeing what we've been talking about, what you've been talking about for decades, is the fall of the republic, this infiltration of globalism where they want to destroy any shape or form of nationalism for the American people, not just politicians.
[00:39:30.793 --> 00:39:32.234]  And this is what people need to understand.
[00:39:32.794 --> 00:39:34.615]  A few years ago, Alex, it was you.
[00:39:34.856 --> 00:39:35.876]  You were in the hot seat.
[00:39:35.896 --> 00:39:37.737]  You've been the trailblazer from the beginning.
[00:39:37.777 --> 00:39:41.220]  They decided to target you in Infowars because that's what you represented.
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:44.042]  Nobody thought that they would go after Trump just as harshly.
[00:39:44.302 --> 00:39:44.782]  They did.
[00:39:45.002 --> 00:39:47.144]  They deplatformed a sitting United States president.
[00:39:47.164 --> 00:39:52.127]  They silenced and censored him immediately because he represented the whole populist movement.
[00:39:52.327 --> 00:39:55.029]  And what people need to understand, they're going to continue to do this.
[00:39:55.069 --> 00:40:01.034]  This is why they're going after Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, because she's a continuation of the populist movement.
[00:40:01.254 --> 00:40:09.480]  And you take a look at that kangaroo court, if we can even call it a hearing, Alex, they're sitting there saying, oh, you said we are not going to go quietly into the night.
[00:40:10.781 --> 00:40:13.483]  Did you steal lines from that movie Independence Day?
[00:40:13.823 --> 00:40:14.903]  It's literally a joke.
[00:40:14.943 --> 00:40:24.289]  They want to literally paint anybody that wears a shirt that says 1776 or July 4th or the 4th of July or anything that's pro-Americana or freedom.
[00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:29.111]  They are literally going to label you as a domestic terrorist in the United States of America.
[00:40:29.431 --> 00:40:30.312]  It's backwards.
[00:40:30.372 --> 00:40:31.973]  And this is where people need to understand.
[00:40:32.273 --> 00:40:35.835]  Because I know a lot of people sit back and they watch what happens to you, Alex.
[00:40:36.175 --> 00:40:38.416]  They watch what happens to Joe Rogan, these big guys.
[00:40:38.456 --> 00:40:39.237]  And it's like, you know what?
[00:40:39.757 --> 00:40:40.737]  They're probably going to make it.
[00:40:40.757 --> 00:40:41.598]  They're going to be fine.
[00:40:41.618 --> 00:40:44.259]  But what's happening is we are all Alex Jones.
[00:40:44.779 --> 00:40:46.259]  We are all Joe Rogan.
[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:48.040]  We are all MTG.
[00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:54.262]  We are all everyone that's getting silenced and censored in the United States of America, whether you're on the left or the right.
[00:40:54.462 --> 00:40:57.944]  This is about totalitarian control and all the leftists out there.
[00:40:57.964 --> 00:40:59.024]  This will prove my point.
[00:40:59.464 --> 00:41:02.585]  Alex, you were you were never this hardcore right winger.
[00:41:02.765 --> 00:41:07.948]   You got arrested for protesting and Going after George W. Bush in the 2000s?
[00:41:08.949 --> 00:41:11.070]  Joe Rogan was never this hard right winger.
[00:41:11.251 --> 00:41:12.411]  I mean, even Tim Pool.
[00:41:12.451 --> 00:41:14.993]  They come out and say Tim Pool is an alt-right YouTuber.
[00:41:15.254 --> 00:41:17.295]  The guy's a hardcore classical liberal.
[00:41:17.335 --> 00:41:17.996]  What's my point?
[00:41:18.036 --> 00:41:18.936]  My point is this.
[00:41:19.216 --> 00:41:21.778]  It doesn't matter what side you find yourself on.
[00:41:22.038 --> 00:41:24.160]  These people just want one thing.
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:25.161]  It's power.
[00:41:25.461 --> 00:41:28.223]  It's power and control of your mind and your life.
[00:41:28.443 --> 00:41:35.789]   And people need to just Set aside the political differences and see that they're literally intentionally pinning us against each other.
[00:41:35.989 --> 00:41:42.654]  They want to spark a civil war so they have an excuse for complete total government overreach to control every single one of us.
[00:41:42.895 --> 00:41:46.077]  And at this point, Alex, that is not a conspiracy theory.
[00:41:46.357 --> 00:41:49.200]  That is quickly becoming reality and we're watching it unfold.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.821]  It is in the process right now.
[00:41:50.861 --> 00:41:51.662]  It's being installed.
[00:41:52.082 --> 00:41:52.582]  Well, that's right.
[00:41:52.602 --> 00:41:54.303]  With tyrants, a couple things can happen.
[00:41:54.343 --> 00:41:55.763]  People wake up to it and stop it.
[00:41:56.523 --> 00:42:01.024]  Or the tyrants take over and get so crazy they collapse everything and destroy their own system.
[00:42:01.524 --> 00:42:14.968]  But then sometimes, like Cuba or Venezuela or North Korea or China, it can go on 50, 60, 70 years and the people are just in perpetual slavery because the nation has so many resources and the people just keep working through it.
[00:42:14.988 --> 00:42:18.268]  Can you imagine America fully captured by that?
[00:42:18.308 --> 00:42:19.009]  What it's going to be like?
[00:42:19.109 --> 00:42:20.749]  It just does not sound like a fun place.
[00:42:22.185 --> 00:42:23.345]  We are being destabilized.
[00:42:23.405 --> 00:42:25.246]  I mean, the Great Reset is in full motion.
[00:42:25.266 --> 00:42:30.387]  And I think a lot of people, when they hear the term Great Reset, it's not just an economic agenda.
[00:42:30.427 --> 00:42:31.387]  That's on the surface.
[00:42:31.447 --> 00:42:33.627]  Of course, they want to just take away the middle class.
[00:42:33.687 --> 00:42:34.468]  They want peasants.
[00:42:34.508 --> 00:42:35.788]  They want the elites at the top.
[00:42:36.008 --> 00:42:40.369]  And that's what they're systemically doing, not only in the United States, but across the entire globe.
[00:42:40.668 --> 00:42:47.028]   but it's also a great reset, build back better, this globalist agenda that hits the heart as well.
[00:42:47.028 --> 00:42:49.368]  And we're starting to see this with Disney as well.
[00:42:49.368 --> 00:42:53.668]   We've been seeing this with the LGBTQ, this woke agenda that's been targeting children.
[00:42:53.668 --> 00:42:56.268]   Now out in the open, these people are literally opposing
[00:42:56.268 --> 00:42:58.187]  an anti-child grooming law.
[00:42:58.187 --> 00:43:01.748]  This same agenda is also a moral agenda as well.
[00:43:01.748 --> 00:43:05.908]  They want people totally depraved of God, of morality.
[00:43:05.908 --> 00:43:07.469]  They don't want anybody with morals.
[00:43:07.469 --> 00:43:11.588]   They don't want anybody to tell the difference between left or right, right or wrong anymore,
[00:43:11.588 --> 00:43:16.908]   up and down, they want everything backwards so that you will just accept anything they put in front of
[00:43:16.908 --> 00:43:17.027]  you.
[00:43:17.027 --> 00:43:18.788]  And Drew Hernandez, you're always on fire.
[00:43:18.788 --> 00:43:22.208]   I want you to expand on that, but it's very simple at its core.
[00:43:22.208 --> 00:43:27.668]   If we're isolated, if we're depraved, we won't stand up for others, they won't stand up for us,
[00:43:27.668 --> 00:43:29.868]  and now we are isolated prey.
[00:43:29.868 --> 00:43:34.868]  Being depraved, immoral, lazy, dumb, satanic idiots is...
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:36.901]  The devil's setting you up for destruction.
[00:43:37.581 --> 00:43:38.942]  And it's very simple.
[00:43:39.462 --> 00:43:42.204]  And there's just... Where do you see all this going?
[00:43:42.224 --> 00:43:43.544]  It's just getting crazy.
[00:43:43.864 --> 00:43:45.725]  Like, everything they do is collapsing.
[00:43:45.805 --> 00:43:46.866]  No one's buying into them.
[00:43:47.246 --> 00:43:48.427]  CNN's gone.
[00:43:49.127 --> 00:43:50.388]  No one's watching any of it.
[00:43:50.448 --> 00:43:52.149]  But then they just keep doubling down.
[00:43:52.469 --> 00:43:54.230]  Biden's led around by the Easter Bunny.
[00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:56.711]  I mean, I feel like I took ten hits of acid here, brother.
[00:43:57.876 --> 00:43:58.416]  Absolutely.
[00:43:58.476 --> 00:44:14.465]  I think everybody's starting to feel like that, Alex, because people are beginning to wake up and realize that everything that people were saying a few years ago about these totalitarian globalist agendas taking over the United States are coming to fruition and they're coming true because it is real.
[00:44:14.825 --> 00:44:16.506]  So I think people are going to wake up.
[00:44:16.546 --> 00:44:18.467]  We've been seeing the populist movement grow.
[00:44:18.567 --> 00:44:31.091]   A lot of people are They're exiting the Democrat Party, they'll say, or they're exiting the woke mob, or exiting these woke agendas, and getting away from these things, and just coming back to sanity, but they want to paint that as like right-wing neo-Nazi organizations.
[00:44:31.111 --> 00:44:31.851]  That's what they do!
[00:44:32.211 --> 00:44:46.334]  But I think more people are going to wake up, Alex, and my hope is, my hope is that it doesn't get worse before it gets better, because sometimes in history you can see God working this way, where people are either going to listen, and they're going to learn one of two ways, Alex.
[00:44:46.774 --> 00:44:53.199]   They're either going to learn by wisdom and experience, Or they're just gonna learn by knowledge and listening of what not to do.
[00:44:53.259 --> 00:45:01.407]  So I hope we don't have to continue to go down this dark path where... I don't know, Alex, is Disney just gonna start pushing out open child pornography?
[00:45:01.467 --> 00:45:03.088]  Is that when we're gonna draw the line, Alex?
[00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:04.670]  That's not when we draw the line!
[00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:11.194]  We don't draw the line when they're openly creating child porn and pushing it out and shoving it down your mouth and saying, you must accept this.
[00:45:11.254 --> 00:45:12.194]  If you don't, you're a bigot.
[00:45:12.374 --> 00:45:13.955]  That's not when we draw the line, Alex.
[00:45:13.995 --> 00:45:18.037]  We draw the line now because they're opposing child grooming laws.
[00:45:18.357 --> 00:45:19.618]  People need to understand.
[00:45:19.658 --> 00:45:24.821]  They need to support people that get this stuff, especially InfoWars and Band.Video.
[00:45:25.001 --> 00:45:30.604]  We don't wait until InfoWars is gone to finally wake up and say, hey, they're at the tip of the spear.
[00:45:30.804 --> 00:45:31.945]  Maybe we should have supported them.
[00:45:32.145 --> 00:45:33.147]  Where can I donate now?
[00:45:33.307 --> 00:45:33.888]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:45:33.928 --> 00:45:34.729]  InfoWars is gone.
[00:45:34.749 --> 00:45:36.512]  You cannot go to a donate button anymore.
[00:45:36.732 --> 00:45:40.838]  We need to support patriots that get this and that are pushing back right now.
[00:45:40.958 --> 00:45:42.000]  And now is the time, Alex.
[00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:42.901]  We cannot wait.
[00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:51.258]  Drew, man, I tell you, I've known you for four or five years, but you are really fired up and just on point with all of this.
[00:45:51.278 --> 00:45:52.018]  We're going to go to break.
[00:45:52.039 --> 00:45:52.719]  We're going to come back.
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:54.221]  You sent me some clips.
[00:45:54.741 --> 00:45:56.443]  I've seen a lot of these, but these are some of the worst.
[00:45:56.463 --> 00:45:57.244]  I hadn't seen these.
[00:45:58.706 --> 00:46:02.490]  Educators and others saying, look, we're going to form a sexual relationship with your child.
[00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:06.410]  And we're going to come after your little girls, particularly.
[00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:10.050]  And you're just watching this, and it's surreal.
[00:46:10.070 --> 00:46:10.871]  You can't believe what's happening.
[00:46:11.291 --> 00:46:12.391]  We're going to play it, folks.
[00:46:12.791 --> 00:46:14.151]  Next hour with Drew Hernandez.
[00:46:14.631 --> 00:46:20.253]  You want to see these demons bragging that we're your teachers, you can't stop us, we have your kids.
[00:46:20.313 --> 00:46:24.333]  Bragging, while you're at work, your kid's online, we're going to get your kid.
[00:46:24.353 --> 00:46:25.114]  They actually say it.
[00:46:25.374 --> 00:46:27.634]  We're going to get your child.
[00:46:28.114 --> 00:46:31.015]  I mean, these people are out in the open and emboldened.
[00:46:31.035 --> 00:46:31.435]  Stay with us.
[00:46:32.825 --> 00:46:44.336]  Alright Drew, this is a short segment, long segment coming up, you know, the pedo groomers and how they're just, they're not out of the closet, they're in our living rooms, they're in our classrooms, they're saying, we're grooming your children, we're coming for them everywhere.
[00:46:44.757 --> 00:46:55.007]  We'll talk about that next segment, but what do you make of Biden being led around by the Easter Bunny, and just by the collapse of confidence in him, and what are they going to do in the midterms in 198 days?
[00:46:57.475 --> 00:47:08.519]  I think it's pretty clear, Alex, that what they needed, this is exactly what they needed, and this is what the far left, the Democrats, and the globalist agenda and leaders needed in the United States of America.
[00:47:08.859 --> 00:47:12.381]  They needed the polar opposite of what President Donald Trump was.
[00:47:12.521 --> 00:47:14.462]  President Donald Trump was not controllable.
[00:47:14.502 --> 00:47:15.422]  You couldn't pay him off.
[00:47:15.802 --> 00:47:16.783]  You couldn't buy him off.
[00:47:16.823 --> 00:47:19.884]  I mean, he was deceived with Operation Warp Speed and all that other stuff.
[00:47:20.911 --> 00:47:32.777]  What President Biden is, if we can even call him that, he's a puppet president, what he is is a total, controllable, hollow shell of a human being that is completely controllable.
[00:47:33.157 --> 00:47:35.619]  I mean, that is what we've been seeing since day one.
[00:47:35.679 --> 00:47:36.839]  He's losing his mind.
[00:47:37.099 --> 00:47:38.400]  He's totally senile.
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:40.741]  He's obviously suffering from dementia.
[00:47:40.981 --> 00:47:42.862]  And I think that's exactly what they needed.
[00:47:42.902 --> 00:47:48.445]  They needed someone that has no morality, that doesn't even have a brain, that is totally controllable.
[00:47:48.485 --> 00:47:49.686]  So there's no pushback.
[00:47:50.106 --> 00:47:52.987]  There's literally nothing that's going to say no to what they want.
[00:47:53.047 --> 00:48:10.050]  No one's going to stop what they're demanding, what they want at the southern border with the Great Reset destroying the economy, with everything taking place culturally and morally in the United States of America with these grooming agendas all unfolding, the lawlessness that continues to abound with the Defund the Police agenda and innocence being destroyed and decimated.
[00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:17.832]  They needed a leader that was not going to question or push back on any of that, but was just going to do as he is told.
[00:48:18.112 --> 00:48:27.960]  And that is exactly what you're seeing with this puppet president in the United States of America, because that is the perfect candidate, the perfect person, in order to unfold an agenda like this.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.782]  But at the same time, Biden knows what he's doing.
[00:48:30.902 --> 00:48:32.583]  I mean, he's been around for a long time.
[00:48:32.723 --> 00:48:35.666]  He's still a little old satanic demon, exactly.
[00:48:35.686 --> 00:48:37.987]  It's just you can see him deteriorating.
[00:48:38.027 --> 00:48:38.788]  So let me ask you this.
[00:48:39.068 --> 00:48:41.090]  He's happy to get blamed for the whole agenda later.
[00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:42.111]  He's so soulless.
[00:48:42.691 --> 00:48:43.411]  I really respect you.
[00:48:43.451 --> 00:48:44.632]  You're one of the smartest people I know.
[00:48:44.672 --> 00:48:45.332]  Let me ask you this.
[00:48:46.132 --> 00:48:48.393]  They're openly promoting infanticide of already born babies.
[00:48:48.893 --> 00:48:50.374]  They're openly promoting pedophilia now.
[00:48:50.514 --> 00:48:51.714]  What comes next?
[00:48:52.154 --> 00:48:53.935]  I mean, there seems to be no bottom to this.
[00:48:53.995 --> 00:48:58.356]  I guess the Democrats are now endorsing nuclear war, saying kill all humans.
[00:48:58.416 --> 00:49:00.337]  I mean, where do they go next?
[00:49:01.727 --> 00:49:03.107]  I think that's what you see, Alex.
[00:49:03.307 --> 00:49:05.628]  I mean, we are literally living in Romans Chapter 1.
[00:49:05.908 --> 00:49:12.029]  If you take a look at the Bible, it has clearly laid out where we are right now with total depravity.
[00:49:12.329 --> 00:49:21.371]  You're seeing the LGBTQ agenda just completely overtake our entire society and culture, and now it's going after children and sexualizing children.
[00:49:21.431 --> 00:49:26.333]  So, along with that, when you read Romans Chapter 1, Alex, you see just total lawlessness.
[00:49:26.373 --> 00:49:27.693]  You see murder abounding.
[00:49:27.993 --> 00:49:38.480]   You see Well that's right, it describes it as children are in charge of their parents, everything's collapsing, nothing works, everyone's poisoned, and it says the evil, just get more and more evil, and finally run off the edge of cliffs.
[00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:40.881]  But here's the crazy part, Alex.
[00:49:41.201 --> 00:49:49.564]  The reason why we call it theologically total depravity is because that means it becomes normal in the minds of the individuals that are depraved.
[00:49:49.804 --> 00:49:55.346]  We are moving into a society where open pedophilia is going to be accepted and normalized.
[00:49:55.365 --> 00:50:01.065]   We are moving towards a society where murder is going to be openly celebrated and normalized.
[00:50:01.065 --> 00:50:05.965]   Where all of these things that are obvious crimes and horrors against humanity,
[00:50:05.965 --> 00:50:11.166]   whether it's children, women or men, all of these things that we obviously would take a look at as normal,
[00:50:11.166 --> 00:50:13.465]  sane people and say, hey, that's wrong. That's evil.
[00:50:13.465 --> 00:50:16.965]   They should be prosecuted and thrown in jail for all of eternity, right?
[00:50:16.965 --> 00:50:20.365]   We are moving towards a society where those things become normalized.
[00:50:20.365 --> 00:50:25.766]   And Alex, Jesus made this very clear that in the last days lawlessness will abound.
[00:50:25.812 --> 00:50:28.614]  He didn't say it might abound, that it will abound.
[00:50:28.674 --> 00:50:30.355]  And here we are in 2022.
[00:50:30.636 --> 00:50:33.938]  It doesn't mean we stick our heads in the sand and say, oh, well, Jesus is going to come back.
[00:50:34.158 --> 00:50:36.300]  Let's just chill and wait for him and enjoy the show.
[00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:37.841]  No, because we don't know.
[00:50:38.001 --> 00:50:41.684]  He may not come back for another 20, 25 years, 30, 100 years.
[00:50:42.024 --> 00:50:44.886]  Right now, we have to stand for righteousness as the Bible and God.
[00:50:44.906 --> 00:50:45.607]  You're totally right.
[00:50:45.667 --> 00:50:49.950]  And when we stand for the white throne judgment, if we didn't fight evil, God's going to say, I don't know you.
[00:50:51.454 --> 00:50:51.915]  Absolutely.
[00:50:51.935 --> 00:50:54.078]  All right, we'll be right back with Drew Hernandez.
[00:50:54.098 --> 00:51:00.809]  We're going to get into the pedo grooming operations that have just gone stratospheric.
[00:51:01.369 --> 00:51:03.152]  Disney, DeSantis and more.
[00:51:03.593 --> 00:51:04.835]  Infowars.com.
[00:51:04.915 --> 00:51:05.937]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:51:08.883 --> 00:51:18.187]  So, an amazing investigative reporter, a guy that gets on the ground in Antifa and on the border and just does really dangerous stuff is Drew Hernandez, a really good friend of mine.
[00:51:18.427 --> 00:51:22.609]  And, you know, I've known him for years and I just see him getting more on fire than ever.
[00:51:23.109 --> 00:51:24.709]  Tucker Carlson getting more on fire.
[00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:28.971]  Savannah Hernandez we were talking about last hour, she just is like getting smarter than I am.
[00:51:29.511 --> 00:51:35.214]  It's exponential as free humanity and everybody else I know is either getting dumber or smarter.
[00:51:35.514 --> 00:51:38.155]  They're either getting more awake or more in delusion.
[00:51:39.142 --> 00:51:40.123]  That really is biblical.
[00:51:40.783 --> 00:51:42.465]  So, Drew Hernandez, I've got a few of these clips.
[00:51:42.485 --> 00:51:43.345]  You sent me a bunch.
[00:51:44.226 --> 00:51:47.208]  And I've seen hundreds of these, but I haven't seen these new ones.
[00:51:47.248 --> 00:51:52.953]  And it's just so disgusting to look at the weird, satanic things in their eyes.
[00:51:53.033 --> 00:52:03.080]  But LGBTQ YouTubers, TikTok creators, claim, all your children belong to us, and we will raise your children just right.
[00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:05.182]  And they say, thank God you let them online.
[00:52:05.222 --> 00:52:06.023]  We've got them now.
[00:52:06.483 --> 00:52:11.467]   Florida teacher says she will still hold Uh, student coming out parties.
[00:52:12.548 --> 00:52:15.671]  And again, it's not about hating an adult with what they do in their life.
[00:52:16.071 --> 00:52:20.355]  These people are doing things adults don't tell their children, wrecking their innocence.
[00:52:20.755 --> 00:52:26.420]  This is mind rape, which is then putting them on the on-ramp to pedophilia.
[00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:28.521]  This is Grooming 101!
[00:52:28.601 --> 00:52:39.690]  These are what people use to drive around in white vans and try to lure kids into cars with puppies and candy, and now they're up there saying we're luring them, and I see new videos every day without looking at City Council.
[00:52:40.011 --> 00:52:41.292]  Yes, I'm grooming your children!
[00:52:41.372 --> 00:52:42.492]  I want to have sex with them!
[00:52:42.733 --> 00:52:45.655]  I mean, and you're like, what?
[00:52:46.316 --> 00:52:47.617]  Where do you see this going?
[00:52:47.697 --> 00:52:52.881]  And with Disney and DeSantis and just all of it, how bad is this going to get before it gets better?
[00:52:52.921 --> 00:52:54.162]  And then we'll go to these clips.
[00:52:55.333 --> 00:53:05.057]  Well, if we don't say anything, Alex, if we don't put a stop to it, if we don't draw a line in the sand, thank God for Governor Rand DeSantis going on offense and saying, OK, enough is enough here.
[00:53:05.497 --> 00:53:05.978]  Stop it.
[00:53:06.018 --> 00:53:07.718]  These people are not going to continue with this.
[00:53:08.079 --> 00:53:09.719]  We all have to have that same heart.
[00:53:09.959 --> 00:53:14.101]  And whatever you can do, depending on you, peacefully, you push back and say enough is enough.
[00:53:14.121 --> 00:53:15.402]  You don't go after our kids.
[00:53:15.442 --> 00:53:20.124]  And like you said, Alex, these are open, open groomers that take to TikTok.
[00:53:20.324 --> 00:53:21.184]  They're open about it.
[00:53:21.224 --> 00:53:22.185]  They're proud about it.
[00:53:22.225 --> 00:53:23.645]  They're just celebrating it.
[00:53:23.685 --> 00:53:24.646]  They're not ashamed of it.
[00:53:24.906 --> 00:53:27.131]  We're not just selectively picking a few freaks.
[00:53:27.632 --> 00:53:29.256]  We're not just selectively picking a few freaks.
[00:53:29.697 --> 00:53:31.100]  There's thousands of these videos.
[00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:32.303]  I can't even keep track of them.
[00:53:33.596 --> 00:53:46.700]  Absolutely, and you're seeing this happen more and more because the more that, oh, we just say that we're going to be tolerant and we're just going to, you know, let this slide and it's just people that want to identify something sexually different.
[00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:49.461]  No, because now that same community is going after kids.
[00:53:49.481 --> 00:53:51.462]  And listen, I'll say the same thing here as well.
[00:53:51.822 --> 00:54:03.166]  If these were straight people, okay, if this was like an organization of Republicans that was doing the same thing, just to use an example, you and I, Alex, would be saying the same crap right now, saying, don't groom the damn kids!
[00:54:03.386 --> 00:54:04.307]  You know, that's a key point.
[00:54:04.367 --> 00:54:09.693]  Heterosexual, homosexual grooming is wrong, but because they see gay as okay.
[00:54:09.753 --> 00:54:15.099]  So it is like, we're lesbians and we're going to talk to your 10-year-old daughter about sex with us and you're not going to stop us.
[00:54:15.139 --> 00:54:16.440]  And it's so sick!
[00:54:16.961 --> 00:54:17.601]  It's sick!
[00:54:17.862 --> 00:54:18.923]  Like you're grown women!
[00:54:19.303 --> 00:54:20.344]  Okay, you want to be lesbians?
[00:54:20.384 --> 00:54:20.965]  Go get women!
[00:54:21.185 --> 00:54:23.047]  Leave our daughters alone, you freaks!
[00:54:23.467 --> 00:54:24.108]  You demons!
[00:54:25.109 --> 00:54:42.117]  Nobody in their right mind, Alex, should want to have the right to have some kind of isolated, secret conversation with a kindergartner about anal sex, penises, vaginas, or anything like that, whether it's heterosexual, homosexual, transsexual.
[00:54:42.378 --> 00:54:45.079]  No adult has the right- No, you're right.
[00:54:45.099 --> 00:54:50.221]  So how do the pedophiles and perverts under the floorboards like cockroaches breed like this?
[00:54:50.281 --> 00:54:52.162]  Like, what the hell's going on here?
[00:54:52.182 --> 00:54:53.163]  Because they're all over the place.
[00:54:54.136 --> 00:54:58.599]  Alex, you and I know that Disney has had a pedo problem for a very long time.
[00:54:58.679 --> 00:55:03.022]  Hollywood is infected, is tainted with pedophilia.
[00:55:03.042 --> 00:55:05.023]  You've been talking about this for decades.
[00:55:05.243 --> 00:55:07.685]  People are just now starting to see it come out into the open.
[00:55:07.885 --> 00:55:17.691]   And it's like I said on the last segment, Alex, The only difference now between the past is that they would do this stuff in darkness and we would see trials come out and people get exposed every now and then.
[00:55:17.931 --> 00:55:20.132]  You would come out and talk about Epstein 10 years ago.
[00:55:20.192 --> 00:55:21.373]  Oh, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:55:21.393 --> 00:55:21.993]  You're crazy.
[00:55:22.254 --> 00:55:28.878]  But now people are starting to see them come out in the open and literally oppose child grooming laws.
[00:55:29.018 --> 00:55:30.519]  It's out in the open, Alex.
[00:55:30.719 --> 00:55:38.824]  And that's what I said on the last segment is the only difference between then is now is that they are openly doing it and they're proud and they're unashamed.
[00:55:39.244 --> 00:55:39.904]  Disgusting!
[00:55:39.944 --> 00:55:40.644]  Well, that's right.
[00:55:40.664 --> 00:55:43.725]  And we've got California and other states trying to kill babies after they're born.
[00:55:44.106 --> 00:55:45.966]  This is about killing and stealing and destroying.
[00:55:46.606 --> 00:55:48.027]  Again, you sent me a whole bunch of clips.
[00:55:48.047 --> 00:55:50.728]  Here's just two of them because this is hard to watch, folks.
[00:55:50.748 --> 00:55:51.368]  We're going to watch it.
[00:55:51.628 --> 00:55:52.428]  Here's clip nine.
[00:55:52.688 --> 00:55:57.670]  LGBTQ YouTubers say, all your children belong to us.
[00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:58.050]  Here it is.
[00:55:59.356 --> 00:56:03.478]  Oh, you don't watch your children taught in school about what gay is?
[00:56:03.498 --> 00:56:09.060]  Oh, that's so nice, because, you know, maybe they would like to watch our channel and find out.
[00:56:09.601 --> 00:56:13.042]  And do you want to know what an asexual lesbian is?
[00:56:13.602 --> 00:56:15.223]  Oh, stick around, honey.
[00:56:15.243 --> 00:56:17.104]  I got you covered.
[00:56:17.304 --> 00:56:19.265]  I will raise you just right.
[00:56:19.605 --> 00:56:22.366]  Your mommy and daddy let you loose on the internet alone.
[00:56:23.146 --> 00:56:24.227]  And that was their problem.
[00:56:25.106 --> 00:56:28.668]  And now, you belong, all your children are belong to us.
[00:56:29.308 --> 00:56:33.410]  Are you sure that you want your don't say gay bill now?
[00:56:35.071 --> 00:56:36.752]  All your children are belong to us.
[00:56:38.572 --> 00:56:40.954]  These are real perverts, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:41.394 --> 00:56:53.740]  And again, you would want your neighbor, if you've known your neighbor five years, you've had barbecues and everything, and you catch the neighbor talking to your daughter about, when she's six years old, about her sex, you would beat their ass.
[00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:59.566]  You would call the police, but now it's creepy women saying, your children belong to us.
[00:56:59.586 --> 00:57:02.710]  I mean, it's the trespassing of this.
[00:57:02.770 --> 00:57:05.093]  The destruction of innocence.
[00:57:05.153 --> 00:57:06.395]  It's just mind-boggling.
[00:57:06.575 --> 00:57:07.196]  Here's another clip.
[00:57:07.456 --> 00:57:10.160]  Here is a Florida teacher talking about your children.
[00:57:11.829 --> 00:57:18.935]  I just want to go ahead and state that I would rather lose my job than out one of my students to their families.
[00:57:20.096 --> 00:57:25.821]  Being a safe person in a safe place for kids that don't have that at home is one of the best parts of being a teacher.
[00:57:25.841 --> 00:57:27.922]  So yeah, I'm not doing it.
[00:57:27.942 --> 00:57:28.783]  I don't know.
[00:57:29.183 --> 00:57:29.624]  Fire me.
[00:57:29.904 --> 00:57:30.264]  Sue me.
[00:57:30.544 --> 00:57:31.165]  Take me to jail.
[00:57:31.185 --> 00:57:31.966]  I'm not doing it.
[00:57:32.846 --> 00:57:40.891]  So she's an elementary school student, a teacher, and she's saying, outing them.
[00:57:40.931 --> 00:57:48.856]  No, you're not outing them, you're brainwashing them and saying you can't stop because you're a freak, you're a scumbag.
[00:57:49.176 --> 00:57:51.917]  You are connected to the sexualization of children.
[00:57:52.237 --> 00:58:02.562]  You're a bad person because you're a disgusting blob that no woman or no man wants and you can only mess with little kids because they're not even supposed to be sexually active and destroy their future.
[00:58:02.782 --> 00:58:03.722]  You monster!
[00:58:03.742 --> 00:58:04.383]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:58:05.236 --> 00:58:06.696]  Well, they're disgusting, they're pedophiles.
[00:58:06.716 --> 00:58:08.277]  She says, oh, I don't care, put me in jail.
[00:58:08.297 --> 00:58:09.577]  Yeah, throw her in jail!
[00:58:10.057 --> 00:58:10.937]  Throw the key away!
[00:58:11.058 --> 00:58:11.858]  Put her in prison!
[00:58:12.098 --> 00:58:13.898]  That's the attitude we need right now.
[00:58:13.918 --> 00:58:16.159]  Put her in a rocket and shoot her ass out in space!
[00:58:16.979 --> 00:58:23.401]  Yes, if these people want to break the law, then we need to uphold the law and throw them in prison for targeting children.
[00:58:23.621 --> 00:58:26.862]  That's the attitude we need right now, peacefully and lawfully.
[00:58:27.002 --> 00:58:28.202]  And I'll say this too, Alex.
[00:58:28.682 --> 00:58:30.703]  Shame on the LGBTQ community.
[00:58:30.743 --> 00:58:32.223]  Now, hear me out here, okay?
[00:58:32.783 --> 00:58:40.569]  What if you do have some kindergarten, third grader, I don't know, fifth grade kid that comes out and says, you know what?
[00:58:41.310 --> 00:58:42.110]  I think I'm gay.
[00:58:42.190 --> 00:58:42.571]  Whatever.
[00:58:42.651 --> 00:58:43.491]  I think I'm gay.
[00:58:43.511 --> 00:58:46.273]  Well, they say that because all they're being told is say that.
[00:58:46.313 --> 00:58:47.274]  It's like they're given a choice.
[00:58:47.454 --> 00:58:48.955]  You want to be Superman or Batman?
[00:58:49.276 --> 00:58:49.856]  Gay straight.
[00:58:50.016 --> 00:58:50.837]  I want to be Batman.
[00:58:50.937 --> 00:58:51.617]  Oh, you're gay.
[00:58:51.637 --> 00:58:52.638]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:58:53.258 --> 00:58:54.339]  But check this out, Alex.
[00:58:54.820 --> 00:59:05.471]   Why would the LGBTQ community not want the parents to have such a sacred conversation with their child When it comes to something as personal like that.
[00:59:05.852 --> 00:59:06.712]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:59:06.772 --> 00:59:15.719]  The LGBT community comes and says, no, if there's some little kid that comes out as gay or whatever, let them have a conversation with some kind of pedophile in the public education system.
[00:59:15.979 --> 00:59:17.481]  Don't let them tell the parents about it.
[00:59:17.761 --> 00:59:22.324]  Who do you think is going to take advantage of a little kid that might be coming out as gay?
[00:59:22.644 --> 00:59:23.865]  Who is going to take advantage?
[00:59:23.885 --> 00:59:24.786]  No, you're totally right.
[00:59:24.806 --> 00:59:25.847]  This is grooming.
[00:59:26.267 --> 00:59:27.568]  This is a pedophile army.
[00:59:27.608 --> 00:59:28.549]  Drew Hernandez in a minute.
[00:59:28.929 --> 00:59:30.971]  Closing comments and I hope people find your great reports.
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:32.380]  Absolutely.
[00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:35.041]  Everybody can follow me on Twitter, Drew H. Live.
[00:59:35.081 --> 00:59:36.462]  You can watch my show every day.
[00:59:36.502 --> 00:59:39.443]  Just go on YouTube, find it, Frontlines, with Drew Hernandez.
[00:59:39.463 --> 00:59:40.963]  And I need to say this before I leave.
[00:59:41.544 --> 00:59:48.046]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones, needs to support InfoWars and Band.Video.
[00:59:48.346 --> 00:59:53.308]  I know Alex doesn't like to talk about this a lot on air, but you know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you.
[00:59:53.328 --> 00:59:54.328]  I'm going to do that right now.
[00:59:54.909 --> 00:59:59.032]   Alex Jones Has helped so many people in this industry.
[00:59:59.052 --> 01:00:04.197]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[01:00:04.457 --> 01:00:10.323]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself.
[01:00:10.603 --> 01:00:14.828]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform.
[01:00:15.248 --> 01:00:19.512]  And I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[01:00:19.812 --> 01:00:27.895]   Even Being my friend or talking to me, I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and TimCast, the super TimCast IRL.
[01:00:28.155 --> 01:00:35.597]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and Band.Video for granted, because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[01:00:35.817 --> 01:00:47.660]  We need to support free speech systems right now, so go check out the store, go support their store, go support InfoWars, leave a donation right now, don't wait until they're gone and there's nothing to support anymore.
[01:00:48.021 --> 01:00:49.621]  Alex Jones- Drew, we love you, thank you.
[01:00:50.774 --> 01:00:55.556]  A good friend of mine, and a guy that's been so busy, I haven't been able to get him on in months, is Robert Barnes.
[01:00:55.616 --> 01:00:56.656]  People are like, where's Robert Barnes?
[01:00:56.936 --> 01:00:57.916]  Robert Barnes is busy!
[01:00:58.617 --> 01:00:59.857]  But he joins us now.
[01:01:00.377 --> 01:01:06.959]  Man, he's been kicking ass on exposing Ukraine, and the economy, and the inflation, and what's going to happen with Biden.
[01:01:06.999 --> 01:01:13.301]  So, I usually ask the questions, but I'm just going to tell Barnes, you've got a laundry list, brother, and we've got a lot of folks tuned in tonight.
[01:01:13.661 --> 01:01:19.474]   I want you to just have the floor, but first off, You've been involved for years as a consultant and watching this and seeing this.
[01:01:19.835 --> 01:01:20.896]  Am I exaggerating?
[01:01:20.916 --> 01:01:22.197]  Because you've seen our financials.
[01:01:22.737 --> 01:01:23.958]  You helped us, you know, produce them.
[01:01:25.141 --> 01:01:29.522]  What is your view on them claiming I'm going to the feds to rat everybody out that's not true?
[01:01:29.902 --> 01:01:31.822]  That I've got 60, 80 million dollars?
[01:01:33.823 --> 01:01:40.604]  What do you make of all this and these double defaults that they've not even announced where they're saying I can't talk?
[01:01:40.984 --> 01:01:45.305]  My lawyers are literally going to wear duct tape over their faces.
[01:01:45.765 --> 01:01:49.606]  What do you make of just this unprecedented move and what does it signify to you, my friend?
[01:01:51.024 --> 01:02:03.379]  Sure, I mean it's a lawfare at a different scale, it's a lawfare at a different level, because what you have are people that, some of whom suffered a tragedy, who are placing blame for that tragedy on someone and something that had nothing to do with the tragedy.
[01:02:04.505 --> 01:02:48.457]   And instead of blaming the school system that failed to provide adequate safety measurements, instead of blaming the psychological industry that has basically, Big Pharma has just, you know, flooded young disturbed kids with medications that can and often does make them worse off, rather than deal with any of those broader cultural phenomena or a Hollywood that celebrates and glorifies certain kinds of violence targeting young vulnerable minds, Instead, they are blaming the independent news broadcast that has produced and published more independent information to challenge and contest institutional narratives and help predict and preview what happened with the lockdowns, what happened with the stolen election, what happened with bogus wars.
[01:02:49.658 --> 01:03:12.215]  InfoWars has been the tip of the spear at warning about the World Health Organization, at warning about Bill Gates, at warning about George Soros, at warning about the globalist agenda to strip ordinary people of their sovereignty over their economy, over their own personal health, over their own well-being, over their own education, to the degree they want to send in groomers to our kindergartens and at Disney World.
[01:03:12.715 --> 01:03:17.337]  So, this is the way they have targeted someone that has nothing to do with what they are describing.
[01:03:18.178 --> 01:03:22.380]  And the legal process could not afford, ever, a trial on the merits.
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:23.540]  A trial on the merits.
[01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:33.725]  Even a liberal Austin jury, even a liberal Connecticut jury, would conclude, based on the evidence, that you are not guilty and Infowars is not guilty of what they've been accused of.
[01:03:34.405 --> 01:03:35.486]  And they couldn't afford that.
[01:03:35.687 --> 01:03:39.810]  And so they came up with a fictional, fabricated, mythical version of the facts.
[01:03:40.191 --> 01:03:43.754]  The media propagated this fake news story all the way through.
[01:03:44.094 --> 01:03:45.075]  That was never true.
[01:03:46.016 --> 01:03:51.341]  That could not be consistent with or be corroborated by actual evidence.
[01:03:51.921 --> 01:03:56.703]  And so for those purposes, they had to pretend that you hid the evidence that never existed.
[01:03:57.203 --> 01:04:03.405]  So rather than admit the evidence disproved their claims, they pretended there was some secret evidence out there that had magically disappeared.
[01:04:03.785 --> 01:04:21.151]  And even though InfoWars produced more documents, more invasive information, more private information, more emails, more messages, even including everything that went into the spam box, than anybody has ever had to produce in the history of anti-slap cases.
[01:04:21.631 --> 01:04:36.627]  In the history of anti-slap motions, they denied InfoWars and every defendant, not just Alex Jones, but InfoWars, every InfoWars entity that they sued, Owen Schroyer, they denied everybody the means to even file a motion to dismiss.
[01:04:37.027 --> 01:04:38.409]  But they weren't satisfied with that.
[01:04:38.849 --> 01:04:54.251]  Then, after all of this invasive, unprecedented, unparalleled discovery, getting information that most courts would never have allowed them to turn over, never would have required to be turned over, the New York Times sure hasn't had to turn it over in its lawsuits involving Project Veritas.
[01:04:54.851 --> 01:05:13.190]  I mean, the courts rushed in to protect the New York Times, whereas they've rushed in to punish Alex Jones at Infowars, after producing over a million pieces of information, most of which never should have had to be disclosed and disgorged after hours and hours and days and days of deposition.
[01:05:13.470 --> 01:05:16.313]  The average case, you only get one seven-hour deposition.
[01:05:16.693 --> 01:05:31.210]  You don't get days and days and days of depositions of the same party, after then denying the right to bring a motion to dismiss, denying the right to bring a First Amendment anti-slap motion, then said, you know what, you can't even present any evidence at trial as to your innocence.
[01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:35.491]  You are effectively gagged like Bobby Seale in the Chicago 7 trial.
[01:05:35.851 --> 01:05:51.054]  You are basically prohibited and limited from being able to present any of the exculpatory evidence that proves and documents and demonstrates not only your factually innocence, but your legal innocence under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
[01:05:51.094 --> 01:05:52.615]  The right of the freedom of press.
[01:05:52.675 --> 01:05:54.395]  The right of the freedom of speech.
[01:05:54.795 --> 01:06:01.670]   And Barnes, you know, it says in here, And the judge signed off, we cannot mention the First Amendment.
[01:06:03.652 --> 01:06:04.092]  Precisely!
[01:06:04.312 --> 01:06:07.054]  Because the First Amendment is a complete defense in this case.
[01:06:07.515 --> 01:06:09.316]  And that's why they don't want the jury to know about it.
[01:06:09.737 --> 01:06:15.421]  And even a liberal jury pool in Austin, even a liberal jury pool in Connecticut, would recognize these facts.
[01:06:15.761 --> 01:06:19.504]  Would recognize this is a classic... Let me ask you this, why are they so desperate?
[01:06:19.564 --> 01:06:20.725]  Why are they so crazy?
[01:06:23.587 --> 01:07:04.851]   Well, if you were about to launch one of the biggest stolen elections in American history, if you were about to launch one of the most destabilizing wars since World War II, if you were about to launch one of the most bogus pandemics to induce massive lockdowns and control over people's populations in history, Then you cannot have an unimpeached, independent media network that is the biggest and most powerful independent media network in the world being able to reach everyone they wanted to reach, being able to have people hear them and get the accurate information, and being able to present that information without a cloud of scandal surrounding it.
[01:07:05.251 --> 01:07:08.232]  So the goal is to tell people, you better not listen to Alex Jones.
[01:07:08.252 --> 01:07:09.773]  You better not listen to InfoWars.
[01:07:10.033 --> 01:07:12.433]  Don't worry, that pandemic's a real pandemic.
[01:07:12.453 --> 01:07:13.874]  We really need that lockdown.
[01:07:14.114 --> 01:07:15.895]  Don't worry, the Russians are really bad.
[01:07:15.955 --> 01:07:18.856]  We really need to think about nuclear war against Russia.
[01:07:18.916 --> 01:07:20.756]  Don't worry, there was no election stolen.
[01:07:21.036 --> 01:07:24.197]  It was just fortified, as Newsweek and Time put it.
[01:07:26.358 --> 01:07:35.423]  And don't listen to whatever you're doing to Alex Jones and Infowars because they have something to do with some crazy guy doing something terrible 10 years ago in Connecticut.
[01:07:35.923 --> 01:07:37.184]  That's why they had to do it.
[01:07:37.204 --> 01:07:39.185]  It was a mass smear campaign.
[01:07:39.225 --> 01:07:46.649]  It was lawfare to try to force you into bankruptcy, but also lawfare for the purposes of smearing your association and affiliation.
[01:07:47.009 --> 01:07:50.631]  So that ordinary people who might hear your voice don't listen to the message.
[01:07:50.951 --> 01:07:53.253]  So they don't know what's really happening with the pandemic.
[01:07:53.273 --> 01:07:55.114]  Don't know what's really happening with the election.
[01:07:55.374 --> 01:07:57.575]  Don't know what's really happening with the global war.
[01:07:58.436 --> 01:07:58.776]  Wow!
[01:07:58.916 --> 01:08:00.497]  You're always on fire, but you are 100% dead on.
[01:08:00.517 --> 01:08:00.577]  So...
[01:08:02.865 --> 01:08:07.928]  Looking at this, and then moving away from how they're attacking Infowars, they're attacking the American people.
[01:08:07.968 --> 01:08:17.433]  Biden shutting off the pipelines, opening the borders, getting rid of medical checks at the border, saying if a man shows up with two kids, don't even check their ID, just let them in.
[01:08:17.993 --> 01:08:25.618]  I mean, the criminal level of action, and then CNN spends $300 million on CNN+, totally fails.
[01:08:25.958 --> 01:08:28.259]  Netflix, Disney in trouble.
[01:08:28.619 --> 01:08:30.901]  The whole globalist system is collapsing.
[01:08:31.994 --> 01:08:34.155]  Clearly they're trying to take us with them.
[01:08:36.135 --> 01:08:38.916]  Where do you see this going, Robert Barnes?
[01:08:38.956 --> 01:08:41.057]  Because it's just madness.
[01:08:41.137 --> 01:08:47.239]  It's just like, why did Hitler attack England and North Africa and Poland and the Russians?
[01:08:47.299 --> 01:08:48.760]  I mean, it's just like, why?
[01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:53.541]  Why did you just build highways and cars and turn your, I mean, it's the same thing.
[01:08:53.581 --> 01:08:57.983]  Like, why are they attacking everybody and our speech and censoring?
[01:08:58.323 --> 01:09:03.260]   Clearly they're not going to win in the end, but the question is, What's going to be left if they've done this?
[01:09:04.761 --> 01:09:06.502]  Well, I think it's two different factors going on.
[01:09:06.862 --> 01:09:11.044]  Globalists love control more than anything else, so everything's about control, control, control.
[01:09:11.364 --> 01:09:17.948]  It's this sort of managerial class's obsession with engineering the world, socially engineering, culturally engineering.
[01:09:20.750 --> 01:09:24.892]  Why are they attacking everybody and our speech and censoring?
[01:09:25.232 --> 01:09:30.135]  Clearly, they're not going to win in the end, but the question is, what's going to be left if they've done this?
[01:09:31.653 --> 01:09:33.415]  Well, I think it's two different factors going on.
[01:09:33.755 --> 01:09:37.939]  Globalists love control more than anything else, so everything's about control, control, control.
[01:09:38.279 --> 01:09:46.647]  It's this sort of managerial class's obsession with engineering the world, socially engineering, culturally engineering, economically engineering the world.
[01:09:47.227 --> 01:09:50.711]  And they're so driven by that psychopathology, they can't help themselves.
[01:09:51.051 --> 01:09:53.153]  The second part of it is they're increasingly removed.
[01:09:53.533 --> 01:10:06.098]   I describe it as they're very much like The communists of the late 1970s, early 1980s, who don't realize their system is collapsing all around them, don't realize the Russian knight is dying inside of its own armor, to quote Russia House.
[01:10:06.518 --> 01:10:12.140]  So, because that obliviousness is an inherent flaw in the managerial class.
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:16.962]  They always seek to control and monopolize so much of the means of narrative distribution.
[01:10:17.222 --> 01:10:18.963]  Because that's what the war on InfoWars is about.
[01:10:19.043 --> 01:10:19.944]  Control the narrative.
[01:10:19.984 --> 01:10:20.845]  Control the story.
[01:10:21.125 --> 01:10:24.168]  Don't allow honest storytellers to reach the ordinary person.
[01:10:24.468 --> 01:10:28.031]  Don't allow that person to understand and appreciate the information they're being given.
[01:10:28.391 --> 01:10:30.853]  That is the reason why InfoWars exists, is its audience.
[01:10:30.913 --> 01:10:32.734]  It's not Alex Jones, the individual.
[01:10:33.095 --> 01:10:34.536]  It's the audience that fuels it.
[01:10:34.636 --> 01:10:37.478]  The audience that not only makes it able to... Exactly!
[01:10:37.538 --> 01:10:39.660]  It's that populist meeting place they fear.
[01:10:40.985 --> 01:10:41.445]  Absolutely.
[01:10:41.525 --> 01:10:44.908]  And they've got to prevent that populist meeting place at all costs.
[01:10:45.008 --> 01:10:46.269]  And they don't realize they're losing.
[01:10:46.549 --> 01:10:47.149]  They don't realize.
[01:10:47.169 --> 01:10:49.511]  I mean, they really thought they were going to take out Putin in Russia.
[01:10:50.191 --> 01:10:52.593]  They didn't realize, you know, Putin believes resources are power.
[01:10:52.633 --> 01:10:54.214]  He's culturally conservative.
[01:10:54.234 --> 01:10:55.515]  He's religiously conservative.
[01:10:55.555 --> 01:10:56.716]  He's the Trump of Russia.
[01:10:57.396 --> 01:11:01.619]  You can disagree with Putin, but the person who hates Putin the most is George Soros.
[01:11:01.639 --> 01:11:07.123]  No, Putin says culture, you know, energy and food, which is exactly.
[01:11:08.274 --> 01:11:19.559]  Correct, and what he's done is he's, the globalists thought if we control the international monetary system at the top, we control the financial system, we can use economic sanction to discipline anybody so that they always obey us.
[01:11:20.079 --> 01:11:23.100]  And they're shocked that it hasn't worked against Russia or the Russian people.
[01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:25.461]  They're people shocked that... Yeah, what are they going to do?
[01:11:25.521 --> 01:11:28.082]  The ruble's above the dollar for the first time in history.
[01:11:30.283 --> 01:11:33.544]  Everybody's leaving, I mean, and people think, well, the globalists are doing it on purpose.
[01:11:33.584 --> 01:11:34.324]  I don't think they are.
[01:11:34.384 --> 01:11:35.465]  They just can't stop them.
[01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:36.830]  Correct.
[01:11:37.031 --> 01:11:37.992]  And they never imagined this.
[01:11:38.192 --> 01:11:41.275]  What happens when you create safe space cultures where you don't listen?
[01:11:41.495 --> 01:11:46.180]  Where you're so obsessed with suppressing people from hearing Alex Jones that you yourself don't hear Alex Jones.
[01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:50.344]  The consequence is you live in such a small bubbled world that you don't know the real world.
[01:11:50.605 --> 01:11:52.747]  These are like the people that were shocked the night Trump won.
[01:11:53.127 --> 01:11:55.649]  I mean, they can't believe that Putin is being successful.
[01:11:55.669 --> 01:12:06.315]  That's why they tell themselves fancy lies like Snake Island and the Ghost of Kiev and, you know, we have a coked-up, you know, Wag the Dog president there in Ukraine and we're pretending he's some George Washington.
[01:12:06.375 --> 01:12:08.456]  He's the next Winston Churchill.
[01:12:08.956 --> 01:12:09.797]  This is delusional!
[01:12:10.457 --> 01:12:11.318]  It's so delusional.
[01:12:11.598 --> 01:12:16.843]  Ukrainian soldiers, when they get caught or shot, because they didn't realize they've been losing in that part of the Donbass.
[01:12:17.143 --> 01:12:19.205]  So, and this is happening across the globe.
[01:12:19.245 --> 01:12:26.631]  They don't realize they're... You have Barack Obama making a speech about, hey, look, we experimented on a billion plus people with this vaccine and it turned out great.
[01:12:27.151 --> 01:12:30.314]  Well, ask all the athletes that are dropping dead right on the field.
[01:12:30.834 --> 01:12:32.976]  The ordinary person knows more and more people.
[01:12:32.996 --> 01:12:40.783]  The ordinary person knows somebody within six degrees of separation of them that has experienced an adverse event in response to this vaccine.
[01:12:41.343 --> 01:12:51.092]  And yet, Obama is so clueless about it, he thinks it's something to campaign on, is this vaccine, whose unpopularity just intensifies and deepens and broadens around the globe.
[01:12:51.432 --> 01:12:54.595]  These are people that the scariest thing about them is their incompetence.
[01:12:54.855 --> 01:12:58.577]  Because they could stumble us and bumble us like Peter Sellers.
[01:12:59.257 --> 01:12:59.618]  You're right.
[01:12:59.718 --> 01:13:08.363]  I'm horrified by these geriatrics and these crazy globalists that have all these behavioral psychologists, but like a hundred different groups.
[01:13:08.783 --> 01:13:12.925]  They're not even coordinating and they're just blasting everything with disinfo and lies.
[01:13:13.245 --> 01:13:15.787]  And then they're burning down, but we're burning down with it.
[01:13:15.867 --> 01:13:18.368]  I'm like, stop, stop.
[01:13:18.748 --> 01:13:19.809]  What do you predict is going to happen?
[01:13:21.181 --> 01:13:27.206]  The good news is, because of audiences like InfoWars' audience keeping InfoWars afloat and alive, which wasn't supposed to happen.
[01:13:27.587 --> 01:13:28.988]  InfoWars was supposed to be gone.
[01:13:29.468 --> 01:13:30.990]  Alex Jones was supposed to be gone.
[01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:32.711]  All of this was supposed to be gone.
[01:13:33.172 --> 01:13:38.777]  Because it failed, because they weren't able to break up the power of the people that are the true fuel of it.
[01:13:38.857 --> 01:13:57.854]   In the same way that oil and commodities and rare earth minerals and wheat are the real fuel of Russia's economy that could not be broken by the globalists, The minds and the spirit and the soul of ordinary everyday people that fuel the engine of Infowars could not be shut down and silenced and consequently more people know today about these fake wars.
[01:13:57.934 --> 01:14:00.376]  More people know today about these bad lockdowns.
[01:14:00.437 --> 01:14:05.982]  More people know today that 2020 was stolen than ever would have or could have otherwise.
[01:14:06.222 --> 01:14:07.864]  They cannot keep it contained.
[01:14:08.124 --> 01:14:11.827]  They cannot destroy the backbone of the American Republic which is the ordinary person.
[01:14:12.728 --> 01:14:14.832]  Flicks imploding and CNN imploding.
[01:14:15.173 --> 01:14:17.437]  How did CNN think no one wants to watch them?
[01:14:17.737 --> 01:14:19.401]  Their average show is 80,000 viewers.
[01:14:19.421 --> 01:14:20.863]  We've probably got millions watching right now.
[01:14:21.384 --> 01:14:22.166]  How did they...
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:32.507]  Think that people would then pay for it and arrogantly CNN make fun of Netflix's problems this week while they're imploding a hundred times worse.
[01:14:32.547 --> 01:14:34.869]  I mean, Netflix still has hundreds of millions of viewers.
[01:14:35.249 --> 01:14:36.851]  Netflix still has all these productions.
[01:14:37.171 --> 01:14:41.574]  I mean, they're a total 20 levels above CNN and it's a total joke.
[01:14:41.674 --> 01:14:42.795]  Yes, they're falling apart.
[01:14:42.815 --> 01:14:47.019]  Yeah, people are tired of the wokeism, but Netflix is still in the game.
[01:14:47.639 --> 01:14:50.481]  CNN makes fun of them while they're imploding.
[01:14:51.522 --> 01:14:56.908]  The destruction of CNN at their own hand is emblematic of the delusion of these people.
[01:14:57.188 --> 01:14:57.949]  And I agree with you.
[01:14:58.089 --> 01:15:00.812]  It's horrifying that they aren't self-aware.
[01:15:02.423 --> 01:15:02.823]  Completely!
[01:15:02.883 --> 01:15:06.064]  Because, I mean, the risk is that they stumble us into a nuclear conflict.
[01:15:06.104 --> 01:15:09.786]  The risk is that they stumble us into some true economic disaster.
[01:15:09.966 --> 01:15:15.408]  The risk is that they get enough people to take a vaccine that it leads to massive health problems around the globe.
[01:15:15.748 --> 01:15:17.949]  That's the risk of these people's incompetence.
[01:15:17.989 --> 01:15:22.750]  They're like the communists who, you know, Mao got his great leap forward.
[01:15:22.770 --> 01:15:24.331]  It's kept leading to mass starvation.
[01:15:24.671 --> 01:15:28.654]  The same thing happened in Russia, not once but twice after the 1920s and again in the 1930s.
[01:15:28.714 --> 01:15:30.615]  Mass famines across the Soviet Union.
[01:15:31.015 --> 01:15:32.316]  So that's the risk.
[01:15:32.376 --> 01:15:39.000]  These people are so incompetent and inept that they will stumble us into some public health disaster or some world war.
[01:15:39.461 --> 01:15:46.105]  But the good news is they're losing the info war, they're losing the economic war, they're losing the political war.
[01:15:46.445 --> 01:15:48.387]  And ultimately, they're going to lose completely.
[01:15:48.647 --> 01:15:49.888]  It's just a matter of time.
[01:15:50.129 --> 01:15:59.398]  And the more desperate they are, the more desperate they sound, that is the siren song of ultimate victory for people who love freedom and liberty in the world.
[01:15:59.938 --> 01:16:00.659]  I totally agree.
[01:16:00.679 --> 01:16:02.481]  Man, it's always, you gotta come back.
[01:16:02.541 --> 01:16:03.522]  You gotta come on more, Robert.
[01:16:03.542 --> 01:16:04.062]  You're amazing.
[01:16:04.563 --> 01:16:05.564]  Let's expand on this.
[01:16:07.076 --> 01:16:09.557]  This is a selfish question, but I really want to pick your brain.
[01:16:10.357 --> 01:16:17.219]  New York Times articles, others say, Jones is reaching out to the feds and wants to tell what happened.
[01:16:17.239 --> 01:16:18.640]  He's going to turn state's evidence.
[01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:20.340]  Well, A, nothing happened.
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:21.400]  I wasn't involved in anything.
[01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:22.521]  I have nothing to tell them.
[01:16:22.541 --> 01:16:23.361]  Plus, I didn't do that.
[01:16:23.701 --> 01:16:25.122]  They keep wanting to meet with us.
[01:16:25.202 --> 01:16:35.385]  And I said, OK, give me immunity and a list of questions and drop your fake charges on Owen Schroer, who they say attacked the Capitol and doesn't work at Infowars in his indictment.
[01:16:36.351 --> 01:16:38.535]  And then it's in the New York Times front page.
[01:16:38.936 --> 01:16:41.221]  Jones is going to rat out what they really did.
[01:16:41.241 --> 01:16:43.285]  I mean, that is so sophomoric.
[01:16:43.726 --> 01:16:45.449]  And you add that on the back of Whitmer.
[01:16:46.744 --> 01:16:51.326]  And all that coming out, that it was provocateured, and the not guilty, and the mistrial.
[01:16:52.046 --> 01:16:55.328]  I mean, it's just bizarre that they're going forward.
[01:16:55.388 --> 01:17:06.113]  So why do you think, literally folks, if you do Alex Jones Google News, over a thousand articles saying, I am going to come out and expose Trump for January 6th.
[01:17:06.153 --> 01:17:07.253]  Just preposterous.
[01:17:07.273 --> 01:17:08.114]  I didn't talk to Trump.
[01:17:08.294 --> 01:17:09.114]  There's nothing to say.
[01:17:09.614 --> 01:17:10.235]  They know that.
[01:17:10.335 --> 01:17:12.996]  So what do you see that as?
[01:17:14.791 --> 01:17:25.862]  I think it's their belief that they can continue to spin this fake narrative about January 6th because they have a fixed judiciary that's mostly corrupt, that's not able to be impartial in D.C.
[01:17:26.222 --> 01:17:31.767]  That the only cases worse than January 6th in terms of judicial bias and prejudice have been the Infowars cases.
[01:17:32.628 --> 01:17:34.790]  I would cite them if I was teaching a law school class.
[01:17:34.830 --> 01:17:36.652]  This is what judicial bias looks like.
[01:17:37.012 --> 01:17:39.655]  This is what the incapacity to be independent looks like.
[01:17:40.816 --> 01:17:46.439]  These cases are not really embarrassing to Infowars as much as they are embarrassing to the lack of independence in our judiciary.
[01:17:46.779 --> 01:17:47.860]  And they speak volumes to it.
[01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:49.441]  And that's true of the January 6th cases.
[01:17:49.841 --> 01:17:56.646]  I mean, you have judges who have admitted the legal charges against many of the January 6th cases do not even meet legal self-sufficiency.
[01:17:56.886 --> 01:17:58.287]  The very basic elements.
[01:17:58.327 --> 01:18:00.528]  They have to be dismissed at the motion to dismiss stage.
[01:18:00.829 --> 01:18:04.271]  And yet other judges are letting people get convicted of this fake crime.
[01:18:04.791 --> 01:18:10.776]  And as we discussed in the lead up to this, the great concern was the government being up to some sort of shenanigan.
[01:18:11.056 --> 01:18:16.120]  The reality is your presence there led to fewer people going in, not more people going in.
[01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:20.463]  And if we had known what QAnon was up to, if we had known that Pelosi and the D.C.
[01:18:20.523 --> 01:18:34.334]  mayor were standing down the National Guard, were taking Capitol Police off of security control, were going to have Capitol Police, as people have testified to already in criminal trials, wave people in to what happened.
[01:18:34.895 --> 01:18:36.397]  Then none of that would have happened.
[01:18:36.517 --> 01:18:38.360]  It happened because of Nancy Pelosi.
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:40.383]  It happened because of the mayor of DC.
[01:18:40.644 --> 01:18:42.206]  It happened because of Mitch McConnell.
[01:18:42.447 --> 01:18:44.830]  It happened because of the seventh floor at the FBI.
[01:18:45.091 --> 01:18:48.336]  It happened because of QAnon being a government-based movement.
[01:18:50.134 --> 01:18:58.736]  I mean, why is it that this January 6th committee that's so interested in the truth has failed to issue a single subpoena to anything related to QAnon?
[01:18:59.076 --> 01:19:01.716]  Why aren't they curious what the federal government has on QAnon?
[01:19:01.937 --> 01:19:04.217]  Why aren't they curious about what the FBI has on QAnon?
[01:19:04.337 --> 01:19:09.798]  Well, exactly, if I got in a proffer with them, I'm going to ask them about Ray Epps and all that.
[01:19:10.018 --> 01:19:15.039]  They had a thousand armed secret FBI there, and they want to ask me what happened?
[01:19:15.359 --> 01:19:16.440]  I mean, it's ridiculous!
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:22.840]   It's like asking A kid at Christmas morning, who Santa Claus is.
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:25.939]  It's like Santa Claus going, "Who is Christmas, young boy?"
[01:19:25.939 --> 01:19:30.340]   And it's like they literally ran the show, and then they're asking me what happened.
[01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:34.838]   It's asking someone who was the victim of their attempted entrapment,
[01:19:34.838 --> 01:19:38.039]  what actually about the entrapment.
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:40.503]  The entrapment is what the federal agents were doing.
[01:19:40.763 --> 01:19:42.846]  The entrapment is what the Capitol Police were doing.
[01:19:43.246 --> 01:19:45.969]  And the reality is they thought because they misunderstood.
[01:19:46.230 --> 01:19:48.833]  They had been busy watching Showtime's version of you.
[01:19:49.293 --> 01:19:50.855]  They thought you would rush in there.
[01:19:51.275 --> 01:19:54.077]  Instead of rushing up to tell people to get out of there.
[01:19:54.377 --> 01:19:58.840]  To asking the Capitol Police to broadcast you telling people to get out of there.
[01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:03.603]  You saved a lot of people's lives that day by your actions and you weren't supposed to.
[01:20:03.623 --> 01:20:10.148]  Because their script had you being this fictional caricature rather than being the populist icon that you are.
[01:20:10.548 --> 01:20:11.589]  And they couldn't deal with that.
[01:20:11.689 --> 01:20:13.050]  They still can't deal with that.
[01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:20.995]  So they're still in fake script land rather than real world land when the real author of the January 6th script is some folks at the 7th floor at the FBI.
[01:20:21.355 --> 01:20:22.836]  I agree.
[01:20:22.876 --> 01:20:25.258]  So, Barnes, come back with me this week.
[01:20:25.278 --> 01:20:26.118]  You've been hard to get on.
[01:20:26.538 --> 01:20:27.419]  You used to come on a lot.
[01:20:27.459 --> 01:20:28.019]  Where have you been?
[01:20:28.059 --> 01:20:29.580]  I've been trying to get you on for months.
[01:20:31.141 --> 01:20:34.163]  Oh yeah, well, I finally have some more free time.
[01:20:34.203 --> 01:20:46.271]  We've been in the middle of representing the whistleblower and the big pharma cases against the vaccine, representing Children's Health Defense trying to end the vaccine mandate or vaccine authorization for children and the vaccine authorization for soldiers.
[01:20:46.291 --> 01:20:46.771]  Yeah, that's important.
[01:20:46.791 --> 01:20:47.752]  That's important work, yeah.
[01:20:49.130 --> 01:20:54.491]  So yeah, sorry, but yeah, yesterday I just got- You're a leading expert on the COVID power grab.
[01:20:55.111 --> 01:20:57.032]  Just give us a gestalt of what it is.
[01:20:57.052 --> 01:20:57.872]  I'm going to give you the floor.
[01:20:57.912 --> 01:21:00.973]  I'm going to be listening, hearing my audio piece.
[01:21:01.413 --> 01:21:03.373]  I'm going to hit the boys room while I'm listening to you.
[01:21:03.393 --> 01:21:05.194]  I got my earpiece here, it's wireless.
[01:21:05.814 --> 01:21:13.976]  I want to hear what you think about the COVID power grab, what happened post-mortem, why they backed off, what's coming next.
[01:21:14.056 --> 01:21:21.136]   New lockdowns, we know they're getting planned, because you are one of the most articulate people Probably the most, other than Robert Kennedy Jr.
[01:21:21.156 --> 01:21:24.360]  I think you're probably the most articulate on that.
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:30.729]  I love Reimer Fulmick, he's amazing as well, but what happened with COVID and what's coming next, Robert Barnes?
[01:21:32.327 --> 01:21:36.931]  So, I mean, ultimately they use the pandemic as a pretext to engage in mass control.
[01:21:37.031 --> 01:21:39.113]  And this is about mass control at a core level.
[01:21:39.133 --> 01:21:42.016]  This is why Bill Gates has been involved in this for almost 20 years.
[01:21:42.076 --> 01:21:44.118]  His father was a big Planned Parenthood guy.
[01:21:44.438 --> 01:21:46.480]  Grandfather was a eugenics connected guy.
[01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:50.284]  There's a reason why he says, why does he like vaccines?
[01:21:50.484 --> 01:21:53.907]  Because he believes it will reduce the public population, reduce the world population.
[01:21:54.267 --> 01:21:56.348]  These are people that are fundamentally about control.
[01:21:56.368 --> 01:22:13.316]  You know, why does he invest in technology that involves global digital currency with a chip that can go into your body, that also invests in a chip that can monitor your health, a chip that will have all your private medical records and financial information on it, and a chip that might have vaccine information on it, because that chip can be used to control you.
[01:22:13.676 --> 01:22:17.499]  It's global control and he's sort of one of the leading spokespersons for it.
[01:22:17.539 --> 01:22:23.282]  You can go back to his 2009 meeting where he's called a superhero because the meeting leaked thanks to a good maid.
[01:22:23.683 --> 01:22:30.747]  An honest maid said, what is George Soros, David Rockefeller, Bill Gates, Oprah and all these other Bill and Bloomberg sitting around talking about?
[01:22:31.048 --> 01:22:33.629]  They were talking about how to control the world.
[01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:34.590]  Global control.
[01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:37.672]  Control at the micro level and at the macro level.
[01:22:38.252 --> 01:22:42.475]  And that's what this was all about, but they need emergencies and excuses to do it.
[01:22:42.815 --> 01:22:47.478]  Just like, well, why do we create a criminal justice system that perpetrates a permanent criminal class?
[01:22:47.818 --> 01:22:49.619]  Because that justifies the police.
[01:22:49.859 --> 01:22:51.100]  No crime, no police.
[01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:55.162]  Why do we keep creating enemies around the world, sometimes real, sometimes fake?
[01:22:55.162 --> 01:22:59.987]  Sometimes fake, but often because of our instigation, our infiltration, our involvement, our support.
[01:23:00.308 --> 01:23:02.230]  Because again, no enemy, no war.
[01:23:02.430 --> 01:23:11.720]  The war machine needs enemies in order to justify war, just as the state needs crime in order to justify police control of its own populations.
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:19.747]  In the same context, emergencies like public health emergencies justify and rationalize this managerial class's monopoly on power.
[01:23:21.169 --> 01:23:23.411]  What does Cuba say makes their government so great?
[01:23:23.491 --> 01:23:25.433]  They stopped COVID from coming to Cuba.
[01:23:25.733 --> 01:23:30.858]  Why is there another lockdown in Shanghai where people are spending their nights screaming from the balcony?
[01:23:31.338 --> 01:23:39.040]  Begging for food, sacrificing their animals rather than being able to survive another day or just to survive another day?
[01:23:39.481 --> 01:23:46.063]  Because China's managerial class says, we stopped COVID and we stopped him with these extreme control policies.
[01:23:46.103 --> 01:23:49.724]  We need to control you in order to stop this terrible disease.
[01:23:50.424 --> 01:23:53.625]  We need to have this massive power in order to keep you safe.
[01:23:54.253 --> 01:23:56.375]  And that's the mindset of these groups.
[01:23:56.415 --> 01:23:57.196]  And that's what they did.
[01:23:57.256 --> 01:23:58.597]  And the vaccines were just part of it.
[01:23:58.617 --> 01:24:01.440]  It was a natural, logical extension of it.
[01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:06.665]  That's why Alex and I and others and Robert Bobby Kennedy were talking about it from day one.
[01:24:06.945 --> 01:24:08.387]  We're saying this is their objective.
[01:24:08.447 --> 01:24:09.268]  This is their goal.
[01:24:09.308 --> 01:24:10.329]  They want total control.
[01:24:10.749 --> 01:24:17.815]  And what bigger, better control is there than putting something in your body that ultimately can be used to control you, and things like chips.
[01:24:18.195 --> 01:24:23.079]  But here we had an mRNA vaccine, not just any vaccine, an mRNA vaccine.
[01:24:23.119 --> 01:24:27.302]  So it gets you conditioned to accept the state sticking in your body, whatever they want.
[01:24:27.683 --> 01:24:30.105]  And if you don't own your own body, what do you own?
[01:24:30.445 --> 01:24:38.071]  We're back to the era of eugenics, and it's not a coincidence they cited eugenics-era court decisions as their legal basis for this massive power grab.
[01:24:38.631 --> 01:24:39.953]  But they had to do it in hiding.
[01:24:40.373 --> 01:24:43.256]  Because all the big drug companies knew their product likely didn't work.
[01:24:43.697 --> 01:24:46.520]  Because there's never been a successful coronavirus vaccine in history.
[01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:49.783]  Because there's never been a successful mRNA vaccine in history.
[01:24:50.263 --> 01:24:51.505]  So here they were doing both!
[01:24:52.085 --> 01:24:54.288]  And so how are they going to sell it to the ordinary person?
[01:24:54.348 --> 01:24:56.530]  How are they going to sucker the ordinary person into doing it?
[01:24:57.290 --> 01:24:59.631]  Well, the drug companies weren't going to do it if they were on the hook.
[01:25:00.111 --> 01:25:04.433]  So they demanded that everything be done under emergency use authorization.
[01:25:04.854 --> 01:25:09.896]  So this emergency, which started out as two weeks to flatten the curve, became two years to control your life.
[01:25:10.476 --> 01:25:11.317]  And that's what they did.
[01:25:11.717 --> 01:25:20.881]  In fact, to this day, here, the FDA has approved a biologic licensed drug for both vaccines, for Moderna and Pfizer.
[01:25:21.342 --> 01:25:31.604]   And yet, That Pfizer FDA approved drug, the Moderna FDA biologic licensed approved drug, is still not available in the United States of America.
[01:25:32.144 --> 01:25:36.328]  Instead, the only thing that's available is the emergency use authorized drug.
[01:25:36.729 --> 01:25:37.349]  Why is that?
[01:25:37.729 --> 01:25:42.414]  Because the emergency use authorized drug has complete immunity from suits.
[01:25:42.887 --> 01:25:46.211]  There's some folks out there that think you can sue them for willful misconduct.
[01:25:46.431 --> 01:25:48.053]  Unfortunately, the answer is no.
[01:25:48.473 --> 01:25:52.177]  You can only sue them for willful misconduct if the government agrees with you.
[01:25:52.658 --> 01:25:53.739]  That's the little loophole.
[01:25:53.779 --> 01:25:54.820]  That's the little footnote.
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:56.362]  That's the little exception.
[01:25:56.802 --> 01:26:00.206]  So consequently, you as an ordinary person have no remedy.
[01:26:00.666 --> 01:26:04.791]  Insurance companies are denying insurance coverage because they're saying, hey, this was an experimental drug.
[01:26:05.511 --> 01:26:09.392]  Employers are denying workers compensation coverage saying, hey, you chose to get it.
[01:26:09.893 --> 01:26:12.133]  So that's the even when there was a mandate in place.
[01:26:12.573 --> 01:26:15.975]  So you have all the risk and they have all the reward.
[01:26:16.475 --> 01:26:19.676]  And what we're seeing is the real risk health wise.
[01:26:19.716 --> 01:26:22.717]  Initially, the fear concern was long tail risk.
[01:26:23.277 --> 01:26:26.819]  Because we don't know what would happen with an mRNA vaccine.
[01:26:26.899 --> 01:26:29.140]  We've never had a successful coronavirus vaccine.
[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:31.121]  This was a novel technology.
[01:26:31.461 --> 01:26:45.829]  The concern was that 5 years, 10 years, 20 years down the road for this untested vaccine, for that kind of length of time, for this kind of virus, for this kind of drug, would have all kinds of unanticipated horrible health effects.
[01:26:46.209 --> 01:26:51.652]  But now, we've had horrible health effects within 3 months, within 6 months, within a year of people getting this.
[01:26:52.072 --> 01:26:53.735]  We're seeing extraordinary rates.
[01:26:54.536 --> 01:27:02.348]  We have blown through every limit that ever existed for public health consequences, adverse consequences to any vaccine.
[01:27:02.729 --> 01:27:06.154]  We've broken all the records and it's the wrong records that we've been breaking.
[01:27:06.893 --> 01:27:09.595]  And the consequence is we see the athletes dropping dead.
[01:27:09.835 --> 01:27:17.341]  We see the excess mortality rate went up 40% in certain categories of people right after they took the vaccine.
[01:27:17.361 --> 01:27:18.762]  And that's from major insurance companies.
[01:27:18.782 --> 01:27:19.682]  So let me ask you this.
[01:27:19.722 --> 01:27:22.344]  This is the most powerful interview ever, Barnes.
[01:27:22.364 --> 01:27:24.185]  The whole crew is just blown away by everything you're saying.
[01:27:24.205 --> 01:27:24.906]  It's totally true.
[01:27:25.566 --> 01:27:26.927]  I'm going to re-air this Sunday.
[01:27:27.168 --> 01:27:33.552]  I'll have plenty to say, but we're going to air this interview Sunday in the second hour of the Sunday Live Show.
[01:27:33.572 --> 01:27:35.994]  I'll be there in the first hour, but people have got to hear this.
[01:27:37.657 --> 01:27:44.844]  Obviously they were scared of Trump and populism, Bolsonaro and others, and Orban, and they admitted they get all this.
[01:27:44.924 --> 01:27:51.850]  Trump, I believe you know him well, means well, he got suckered into it, doesn't want to admit he's wrong, at least he's not promoting this gene therapy shot now.
[01:27:52.751 --> 01:27:55.233]  But regardless, it blew up in their face.
[01:27:55.273 --> 01:28:02.056]  They've had to back off at least for a time when they intended to have the lockdown go forever, obviously.
[01:28:02.177 --> 01:28:08.640]  So how would you describe the world right now, geopolitically, with what's happening?
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:10.701]  Because the globalists are failing on every front.
[01:28:12.062 --> 01:28:18.006]  They've got incompetent minions they want to run in charge because they don't want to have a real president or somebody that wants to be their own person.
[01:28:19.122 --> 01:28:26.505]  So their own attempts to have no one in charge, because they're in charge but they're not in charge, is the real danger.
[01:28:26.545 --> 01:28:30.166]  And I mean, I just see major problems here.
[01:28:30.206 --> 01:28:33.487]  You know, they think we want to be the new aristocrats.
[01:28:34.027 --> 01:28:35.848]  They think we're battling for freedom.
[01:28:37.472 --> 01:28:38.553]  Because we want to be king.
[01:28:38.693 --> 01:28:42.654]  Like, when they offered George Washington to be king, he said, no, I don't want to be king.
[01:28:43.235 --> 01:28:52.959]  And King George III finally woke up and put the American flag up, and then said, okay, you know, George Washington is the greatest man in the world.
[01:28:53.379 --> 01:28:57.221]  Because he beat them, and then he didn't take the power.
[01:28:57.261 --> 01:29:00.663]  People don't know that when George Washington died, they ran American flags up in the UK.
[01:29:01.523 --> 01:29:07.726]  I mean, in England, because they thought they would double-cross with the British, use that to parlance to take over the Caribbean.
[01:29:07.986 --> 01:29:09.087]  And no, George Washington did that.
[01:29:09.107 --> 01:29:11.148]  He said, no, we wanted freedom.
