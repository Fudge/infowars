[00:00.000 --> 00:09.160]  It's Sunday, April 24th, 2022, and we are live.
[00:09.160 --> 00:11.000]  Defense of Liberty.
[00:11.000 --> 00:19.160]  Info wars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:19.160 --> 00:24.880]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:24.880 --> 00:26.600]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:26.600 --> 00:29.080]  Well, so does he.
[00:29.080 --> 00:34.080]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:34.080 --> 00:39.640]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Sunday broadcast.
[00:39.640 --> 00:44.360]  We have got an amazing transmission lined up for you today.
[00:44.360 --> 00:49.560]  Drew Hernandez is a great reporter, and he's got so many big topics, and thinks he's personally
[00:49.560 --> 00:53.480]  eyewitness, so he's going to be joining us about in the last segment of this hour and
[00:53.480 --> 00:56.360]  a little bit into the next hour.
[00:56.360 --> 01:01.200]  And then, during the 40-hour money bomb emergency broadcast, which I thank everybody for tuning
[01:01.200 --> 01:05.520]  into and supporting, you're amazing, your fighting spirit is incredible.
[01:05.520 --> 01:06.520]  I had Robert Barnes on.
[01:06.520 --> 01:07.520]  He hadn't been on about three months.
[01:07.520 --> 01:10.120]  He's been so busy with cases and things he's doing.
[01:10.120 --> 01:12.160]  He was on fire.
[01:12.160 --> 01:14.800]  Everybody in the studio said it after he was gone.
[01:14.800 --> 01:16.480]  I got calls from all over.
[01:16.480 --> 01:22.120]  I mean, he just was dead on an hour-long interview, which I'm going to air 30 minutes of it in
[01:22.120 --> 01:23.720]  the second hour.
[01:23.720 --> 01:26.440]  Just to get people hooked, you'll go to Band-Aught Video.
[01:26.440 --> 01:30.120]  It's free there, and share the daylights out of the interview.
[01:30.120 --> 01:31.120]  It is very important.
[01:31.120 --> 01:35.680]  Robert Barnes, the left is running scared, attempting to trigger civil war.
[01:35.680 --> 01:37.360]  And that's a fact.
[01:37.360 --> 01:40.600]  That is absolutely going on.
[01:40.600 --> 01:44.920]  But you can see that we probably put out 50 videos Friday and Saturday.
[01:44.920 --> 01:45.920]  That's a glut of videos.
[01:45.920 --> 01:49.760]  Usually, you don't have a bunch of videos getting more than 50,000 views when we put out that
[01:49.760 --> 01:53.120]  many videos, because there's hundreds of them.
[01:53.120 --> 01:59.360]  The Barnes video, no promotion, 300 plus thousand views, just as it went up yesterday.
[01:59.360 --> 02:03.040]  I called up on the weekend crew, and I said, that's a pretty hot interview.
[02:03.040 --> 02:06.160]  You should cut it out and post it, and they went, phew.
[02:06.160 --> 02:08.960]  So powerful, I'm not hyping it.
[02:08.960 --> 02:09.960]  It's powerful.
[02:09.960 --> 02:14.680]  It's just dead on, machine gun on, everything he says is just nailed, nailed, nailed, nailed,
[02:14.680 --> 02:15.680]  nailed.
[02:15.680 --> 02:16.840]  So amazing.
[02:16.840 --> 02:19.040]  Definitely bringing his A-game.
[02:19.040 --> 02:23.440]  He's always smart, but he blew me away Friday.
[02:23.440 --> 02:26.520]  Amazing job of the crew, working 40 hours straight in the money bomb.
[02:26.520 --> 02:32.720]  We did bring in a million dollars between Thursday, Friday into Saturday, and reached
[02:32.720 --> 02:34.760]  our goal Saturday evening.
[02:34.760 --> 02:35.760]  I want to thank you all.
[02:35.760 --> 02:38.720]  Now, again, most of that's product sales, so it's really about $500,000.
[02:38.720 --> 02:44.400]  But that will take us over the edge we need to be able to buy supplements and other products
[02:44.400 --> 02:50.520]  to the future, to then sell and have money to operate, so our underage is now about a
[02:50.520 --> 02:54.120]  million and a half dollars, and hopefully if I work hard and get some sponsors and stuff
[02:54.120 --> 02:57.560]  the next month, I'm just going to, I'm going to go forward like we're not going to lay
[02:57.560 --> 03:02.200]  people off and implode, because, again, I could stop ordering product and operate great
[03:02.200 --> 03:08.960]  for six, seven, eight, nine months, but then once the product's all sold out, we are insolvent.
[03:08.960 --> 03:12.840]  So we're up against the globalists, we're toe-to-toe with them, I appreciate you keeping
[03:12.840 --> 03:13.840]  us in the fight.
[03:13.840 --> 03:14.840]  We're in this together.
[03:14.840 --> 03:16.680]  They are trying to get through me to get to you.
[03:16.680 --> 03:18.720]  When Trump says that, he's absolutely right.
[03:18.720 --> 03:25.040]  And when he said this last night at a packed rally, he was also dead on that Biden is being
[03:25.040 --> 03:29.080]  given orders and led around by the Easter Bunny at multiple events, doesn't know who
[03:29.080 --> 03:31.480]  he is, and is shaking hands with the air.
[03:31.480 --> 03:32.480]  Here it is.
[03:32.480 --> 03:42.120]  And we have a president right now, sadly, who has absolutely no idea what the hell is happening.
[03:42.120 --> 03:50.600]  He's shaking hands with the air, he's walking around, somewhat bewildered, I'd say it's
[03:50.600 --> 03:56.880]  no good and taking orders from the Easter Bunny, you saw that one, no, no, no.
[03:56.880 --> 04:00.480]  You know, I always joke around and say, oh, and the Easter Bunny's going to drop by and
[04:00.480 --> 04:03.920]  make jokes about the Easter Bunny, like global warming's real and so is the Easter Bunny,
[04:03.920 --> 04:10.120]  but literally, he takes orders from everybody because he is in deep dementia and this was
[04:10.120 --> 04:14.400]  done by design, so the globalists can blame him for their agenda, and so they never get
[04:14.400 --> 04:15.400]  in trouble for it.
[04:15.400 --> 04:20.520]  All right, I have gotten really prepared for this broadcast.
[04:20.520 --> 04:25.520]  We've also got some really positive, fun stuff happening in the fight for liberty.
[04:25.520 --> 04:30.280]  Mike Tyson has been being very supportive of the broadcast, so has Tucker Carlson with
[04:30.280 --> 04:32.640]  Savannah Hernandez, and why is that important?
[04:32.640 --> 04:37.280]  If the left can demonize me and make everybody turn on me, they can get everybody to turn
[04:37.280 --> 04:38.280]  on America.
[04:38.280 --> 04:42.720]  Because I am a symbol to the globalists of America of you, and it's just, it's true.
[04:42.720 --> 04:48.200]  They see me as the populace they hate, and the loud Texan Second Amendment Christian
[04:48.200 --> 04:52.120]  who never backs down, and they are just dedicated to destroying me, but it's actually causing
[04:52.120 --> 04:56.680]  the reverse, and it's turned the broadcast into a folk hero operation, and it's really
[04:56.680 --> 05:01.120]  exploding right now.
[05:01.120 --> 05:04.520]  We have over 100 designs of t-shirts that just sit there in our warehouse.
[05:04.520 --> 05:09.360]  We need to sell those shirts to fund the operation, but we've already made some orders on future
[05:09.360 --> 05:10.520]  shirts coming in.
[05:10.520 --> 05:13.680]  These are all limited editions, so once these new shirts come in, we're going to sell those,
[05:13.680 --> 05:14.680]  and that's it.
[05:14.680 --> 05:18.640]  We'll have limited editions one at a time in the future, and when they're gone, they're
[05:18.640 --> 05:19.640]  gone.
[05:19.640 --> 05:21.200]  Well, here's the new limited edition shirt.
[05:21.200 --> 05:23.880]  This one is $24.95, a really nice fabric.
[05:23.880 --> 05:28.480]  Alex Jones was right on the front with a big red lightning bolt on the back, infowars.com.
[05:28.480 --> 05:32.480]  You talk about triggering, you talk about spreading the word, you talk about waking people up.
[05:32.480 --> 05:38.080]  Alex Jones was right, fundraiser shirt, we need the funds to operate, infowarsstore.com.
[05:38.080 --> 05:41.280]  Alex Jones was right, it's a gorgeous shirt, we're really proud of it.

[05:52.600 --> 05:57.520]  in a better way than wearing an Alex Jones was right shirt with infowars.com, big on
[05:57.520 --> 06:04.920]  the back, available now for limited time, infowarsstore.com.
[06:04.920 --> 06:16.040]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex
[06:16.040 --> 06:17.040]  Jones.
[06:17.040 --> 06:24.000]  You have a president that has to be let around by the nose like he is a your terminal Alzheimer
[06:24.000 --> 06:31.880]  patient who shakes hands with the air and who takes orders from the Easter Bunny.
[06:31.880 --> 06:35.840]  America's enemies work very, very hard to put this puppet in power, now they're planning
[06:35.840 --> 06:41.920]  a civil war in the Republic as we know it, but humanity is awakening, we still have
[06:41.920 --> 06:43.440]  time to stop it.
[06:43.440 --> 06:47.600]  Here is our real president, he's done some things I don't like, but boy do I love him,
[06:47.600 --> 06:52.960]  boy is he funny, just telling it like it is, and of course this information is being censored
[06:52.960 --> 06:57.520]  off of every major platform because we're not allowed to hear from our former president,
[06:57.520 --> 07:01.000]  he's supposed to be banned and taken off the air like infowars is.
[07:01.000 --> 07:02.000]  Here is Trump.
[07:02.000 --> 07:12.040]  And we have a president right now sadly who has absolutely no idea what the hell is happening.
[07:12.040 --> 07:21.000]  He's shaking hands with the air, he's walking around, somewhat bewildered, it's no good
[07:21.000 --> 07:27.240]  in taking orders from the Easter Bunny, you saw that one, no, no, no.
[07:27.240 --> 07:30.680]  And here's the point I've been making really hard lately because other people don't seem
[07:30.680 --> 07:32.400]  to be making it.
[07:32.400 --> 07:36.560]  It's fun to make fun of Biden, it's fun to make fun of the left, except they're run
[07:36.560 --> 07:40.880]  by the big corporations and are kicking our ass, they're running circles around us, they're
[07:40.880 --> 07:45.520]  stealing elections, they're trying to disqualify anybody from running for office that questions
[07:45.520 --> 07:50.280]  elections when that is the duty and right of every American and we send the State Department
[07:50.280 --> 07:54.240]  around all of the world to monitor other people's elections that are much more open and fair
[07:54.240 --> 07:56.040]  than ours.
[07:56.040 --> 07:58.080]  It's stunning.
[07:58.080 --> 08:01.840]  Speaking of that, Francis McCron wins reelection, dodges political earthquake, I don't believe
[08:01.840 --> 08:07.400]  that for a minute, famous election fraud over there in France, yeah they've gone to paper
[08:07.400 --> 08:13.280]  ballots but they're still tabulated at a central center, she was way ahead in all the polls
[08:13.280 --> 08:15.680]  but of course lost.
[08:15.680 --> 08:20.560]  In areas where conservatives have been able to maintain control, where the left never
[08:20.560 --> 08:23.280]  got control, magically she wanted a landslide.
[08:23.280 --> 08:27.320]  Once the left gets control, whether it's in France or whether it's in Germany or whether
[08:27.320 --> 08:33.760]  it's in the U.K. or Canada or the U.S., they never relinquish control and you wonder why
[08:33.760 --> 08:39.640]  things get so bad, well it's because they're engaged in total fraud and know that no one
[08:39.640 --> 08:47.760]  can ever remove them, McCron won by 58.8% we're told and Lepin by 41.2% despite even the scientific
[08:47.760 --> 08:49.800]  polls showing her winning.
[08:49.800 --> 08:55.600]  So there you go, I don't buy it for a single second, oh but I'm evil, that's a sign of
[08:55.600 --> 09:03.240]  terrorism but oh, Democrat lawyers have been going around the country trying to ban anyone
[09:03.240 --> 09:08.680]  from offices, I said earlier, if they questioned the elections, even though the Democrats promised
[09:08.680 --> 09:14.280]  that if they thought Trump had won, they would never accept it and have their quote own inauguration.
[09:14.280 --> 09:20.000]  Judge dismisses lawsuits trying to bar Representative Paul Gozer, Andy Biggs from running for reelection
[09:20.000 --> 09:26.000]  but it's going forward because they picked the right Democrat-controlled judge in Georgia
[09:26.000 --> 09:32.640]  and they're very close to barring Marjorie Taylor Greene from running for office who
[09:32.640 --> 09:38.000]  won by over 70% landslide because she's so popular they fear her.
[09:38.000 --> 09:42.720]  So oh, she thinks that we're trying to stop the will of the voter so you can't vote for
[09:42.720 --> 09:50.480]  who you want, doing exactly what she says they're doing, I mean it's just preposterous
[09:50.480 --> 09:55.560]  that that is going on and we've got great reporter, Drew Hernandez joining us, coming
[09:55.560 --> 09:59.160]  up a little bit later in the hour to talk about that and then a bunch of videos he's
[09:59.160 --> 10:00.160]  put together.
[10:00.160 --> 10:03.600]  Now there's more than 20 of these and I'm not going to play them all, we're going to
[10:03.600 --> 10:08.760]  play two or three of them, school teachers saying we're grooming your children and we're
[10:08.760 --> 10:12.800]  going to teach them how to be lesbians and we're going to teach them how to have sex
[10:12.800 --> 10:13.880]  with each other.
[10:13.880 --> 10:19.040]  This is pedophilia, this is pedo talk and they say we know your kids are online, we
[10:19.040 --> 10:24.840]  don't care that it's your fault you to keep them from us so we're going to get them and
[10:24.840 --> 10:29.120]  when you turn your children over to these public schools and things this is what happens.
[10:29.120 --> 10:36.120]  This has happened to people in Austin very close to me that have children who put them
[10:36.120 --> 10:42.760]  in a main line, nice upper end public school, the Eames school district, the richest school
[10:42.760 --> 10:48.440]  district in Texas and their 10 year olds came back and said I'm a lesbian and they
[10:48.440 --> 10:53.580]  target little girls and teach them this and now that they like girls, I mean you are talking
[10:53.580 --> 11:00.840]  about unbelievable stuff and they're not just inducting them to be attracted to girls because
[11:00.840 --> 11:06.640]  that in anthropology, sociology, psychology, most women that have at one or point are attracted
[11:06.640 --> 11:10.320]  to girls and there's some physiology to that but then of course they are more attracted
[11:10.320 --> 11:14.320]  to males and that goes back to you know the men are off for a long time away when the
[11:14.320 --> 11:18.480]  women are back at home, I mean let's just get honest about women's psychology but they're
[11:18.480 --> 11:21.680]  indoctrinating them into a whole leftist system and they're doing it not when they're
[11:21.680 --> 11:25.800]  adult women but when they're little children, that's grooming and it's specifically into
[11:25.800 --> 11:31.280]  the whole LGBT cult and they're saying parents you can't stop us, your kids belong to us
[11:31.280 --> 11:40.360]  just like the San Francisco choir did so that is coming up ladies and gentlemen.
[11:40.360 --> 11:46.400]  In the second hour, a lot of big developments with January 6th and the roll out of that
[11:46.400 --> 11:50.800]  and how the left wants to start a martial law, we're going to be laying that out and
[11:50.800 --> 11:53.880]  their plan and how we can peacefully stop it.
[11:53.880 --> 11:58.560]  We have Senator Orrin Hatchdyne, I'll get some of that, we've got Eon Musk really endearing
[11:58.560 --> 12:02.840]  himself to be more and more going after Bill Gates in a hilarious way.
[12:02.840 --> 12:08.560]  We have just got so much to hit on the COVID-19 front and on the collapse of the border in
[12:08.560 --> 12:14.080]  fact that's really the most important thing front and center right now and we're going
[12:14.080 --> 12:22.280]  to hit that in the next segment but just think about that, you have the third world starving
[12:22.280 --> 12:25.920]  to death because of two years of lockdowns, the IMF and World Bank ordered two years of
[12:25.920 --> 12:30.200]  lockdowns in most other countries, you have major food shortages, hundreds of millions
[12:30.200 --> 12:36.760]  set to starve to death, tens of millions have already died and then now with the world food
[12:36.760 --> 12:43.600]  chain delivery system breaking down, they now say hundreds of millions are headed towards
[12:43.600 --> 12:49.280]  Europe and North America currently in the next five years, tens of millions a year you
[12:49.280 --> 12:55.400]  already see that and here it is, eyes prepared for surge of migrants as Title 42 draws to
[12:55.400 --> 12:59.520]  a close, they will not check of a man's with little kids to see the dad or a woman is with
[12:59.520 --> 13:03.360]  little kids, they will not check for medical to see if they have any diseases, they're
[13:03.360 --> 13:09.640]  just going to release you 100%, this has already been going on but now no TB test, no nothing
[13:09.640 --> 13:13.760]  but oh you need to take all these deadly COVID shots or you can't go to your work or your
[13:13.760 --> 13:20.040]  job, this is unbelievable collapse of the country, can't do a medical check on people
[13:20.040 --> 13:26.440]  they're just going to turn loose but federal court orders first gender affirming surgery
[13:26.440 --> 13:30.800]  for transgender prisoner, don't just have men saying they're women getting women pregnant
[13:30.800 --> 13:35.840]  in prison from New Jersey to California, they now are going to get taxpayers to pay to have
[13:35.840 --> 13:44.040]  their penises and testicles cut off, so this is unbelievable time to be alive and really
[13:44.040 --> 13:49.800]  what that is is making sterilized fashionable and so a lot of folks will say hey like the
[13:49.800 --> 13:54.240]  sheriff out in Florida said hey we love it when you shoot burglars, we don't have to
[13:54.240 --> 13:58.440]  spend time and money putting them in jail and president paying for them and I get what
[13:58.440 --> 14:05.920]  he's saying okay and hey you got these prisoners in there, go ahead and opt them in to have
[14:05.920 --> 14:10.720]  their genitals cut off so they don't produce anymore but it's going to end up being everybody
[14:10.720 --> 14:14.560]  ladies and gentlemen and it sets a dangerous precedent and sure if you can get some whack
[14:14.560 --> 14:19.160]  job to have his testicles cut off who's like a rapist that's great in prison and if he
[14:19.160 --> 14:26.560]  opts in good cut them off, I mean it's a free world but they're targeting four year olds
[14:26.560 --> 14:30.920]  in this country and in England to tell them that they need to sign up and then the state
[14:30.920 --> 14:36.000]  takes over control of the child, takes control of the decision making process and removes
[14:36.000 --> 14:41.120]  the parental relationship completely and then wrecks that child psychologically so that
[14:41.120 --> 14:47.640]  is satanic massive criminal abuse and it's completely wrong and so what you let me done
[14:47.640 --> 14:51.520]  to the prisoners even though you're kind of like me I bet like well yeah screw them
[14:51.520 --> 14:55.600]  let them do it, it's going to end up being all of us and that's how evil works, it tricks
[14:55.600 --> 15:00.320]  you to cut corners because oh well they deserve it and then once that new process is gone
[15:00.320 --> 15:04.520]  and once this sick stuff is in place it's everybody and we're in big trouble.
[15:04.520 --> 15:08.680]  Speaking of that I mean imagine just reading this headline LA Times, New York Times are
[15:08.680 --> 15:14.240]  all promoting it like it's no big deal, here's Town Hall, with California looking to legalize
[15:14.240 --> 15:20.440]  and fantasize pro-lifers are resisting, I mean can you even believe that we're in a world
[15:20.440 --> 15:25.880]  with headlines like that and that states like New York pass laws where you can keep a baby
[15:25.880 --> 15:33.480]  alive and kill it, yeah that's what this is ladies and gentlemen, these people are out
[15:33.480 --> 15:37.680]  of control but they have a plan, we have to be aware of their plan and stand up and say
[15:37.680 --> 15:43.280]  no, we've got some big great reset news as well today, Debo's Group news, Bill Gates

[17:00.400 --> 17:05.080]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war
[17:05.080 --> 17:10.720]  between free individuals and nation states on one side and the globalist on the other
[17:10.720 --> 17:14.320]  who are literally trying to create a post-human world.
[17:14.320 --> 17:18.520]  From the United States to Brazil, and of course triggered by the Brexit in the UK, nations
[17:18.520 --> 17:22.440]  were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government, that's why they
[17:22.440 --> 17:29.400]  launched their great recess and their program after collapsing us of Build Back Better.
[17:29.400 --> 17:35.400]  This is nothing more than a top-down, vertical consolidation of the world economy, and because
[17:35.400 --> 17:39.680]  they couldn't take our guns, and because we wouldn't bow, because the left, which is
[17:39.680 --> 17:45.040]  the ideology of this world government system, couldn't win, they released a biological weapon
[17:45.040 --> 17:46.040]  on us.
[17:46.040 --> 17:51.080]  Now we know, two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago, it's that simple,
[17:51.080 --> 17:55.440]  they can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns, so the global corporate combine
[17:55.440 --> 18:00.400]  released COVID-19 and you know the rest of history, expose this paradigm and we win.

[19:56.080 --> 19:57.080]  Take action now.
[19:57.080 --> 20:01.600]  InfoWarsTour.com.
[20:01.600 --> 20:18.560]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:18.560 --> 20:21.360]  Alex Jones show, thank you so much for joining us.
[20:21.360 --> 20:26.440]  I'm going to talk in the next segment about the keys to victory and the fact that more
[20:26.440 --> 20:33.000]  and more people like Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Marjorie Taylor Greene and Savannah Hernandez
[20:33.000 --> 20:36.680]  and so many other people get, and that if we get this as Christians and conservatives
[20:36.680 --> 20:41.160]  and as populists and as nationalists or just people that are common sense and don't want
[20:41.160 --> 20:45.200]  to be slaves, it's game over.
[20:45.200 --> 20:47.280]  The system has collapsed.
[20:47.280 --> 20:49.400]  It knows everybody's done with it.
[20:49.400 --> 20:53.280]  It knows it's in deep trouble and they know they're all going to go to prison for what
[20:53.280 --> 20:58.600]  they've done unless they can trigger worldwide collapse and make us all kill each other so
[20:58.600 --> 21:00.720]  they can pose as the savior.
[21:00.720 --> 21:04.440]  Over crises so horrible, we forget about all the crimes they've committed.
[21:04.440 --> 21:08.280]  The good news is we're here on air during all of this and you're out there spreading
[21:08.280 --> 21:14.360]  the word despite all their censorship so people know worldwide it's the New World Order.
[21:14.360 --> 21:19.160]  But it's life and death to expose them so that what they're carrying out will be lessened
[21:19.160 --> 21:25.400]  and will be mitigated and will be dealt with and will be stopped in many cases and then
[21:25.400 --> 21:31.640]  they all are destroyed by their actions instead of them executing this collapse and these
[21:31.640 --> 21:35.880]  many civil wars and all the rest of it and having us be too stupid to figure out what
[21:35.880 --> 21:36.880]  they've done.
[21:36.880 --> 21:38.680]  You see, they're arrogant.
[21:38.680 --> 21:43.920]  They think because the public's asleep, they're stupid and I found people are really smart
[21:43.920 --> 21:50.680]  but they're selfish and in a trance-like state, the sleeper must awaken.
[21:50.680 --> 21:57.400]  You must be reborn, Christ says and I'm telling you, once you shift and once you have the
[21:57.400 --> 22:01.320]  Holy Spirit, it leads God's and directs you and then your understanding of how the world
[22:01.320 --> 22:07.400]  works will become exponential and it's the most incredible voyage ever and I know most
[22:07.400 --> 22:09.000]  of you are already on that voyage.
[22:09.000 --> 22:10.000]  It's why you're here.
[22:10.000 --> 22:13.840]  You're more advanced than I am but it is incredible.
[22:13.840 --> 22:18.400]  By the way, I'm going to hit this big news on the border first and I'm not ready to talk
[22:18.400 --> 22:26.040]  about this because I've been asked to by some very, very smart people but they agree it
[22:26.040 --> 22:33.600]  needs to go public and it will in the next week and a half, probably the next week.
[22:33.600 --> 22:39.840]  But the Justice Department is not even hiding it.
[22:39.840 --> 22:44.120]  They're meddling in my court cases, federal and state.
[22:44.120 --> 22:50.600]  We have sworn witnesses and their own emails and the thing is, they're so mad dog now,
[22:50.600 --> 22:53.120]  they're not even hiding it.
[22:53.120 --> 22:59.480]  So you wonder how I'm defaulted and how I don't get to face my accusers and how I don't
[22:59.480 --> 23:03.760]  get to speak at these kangaroo trials or you see the Justice Department involved in
[23:03.760 --> 23:06.640]  Jones's bankruptcy.
[23:06.640 --> 23:12.720]  I'm not going to talk about it yet but I will and it is something that retired judges,
[23:12.720 --> 23:14.320]  federal judges, people have never seen.
[23:14.320 --> 23:24.560]  I mean their mouths are hanging open, hanging open, oh and they're not intimidated.
[23:24.560 --> 23:30.040]  There comes a point with the pushing of the authoritarians where people go, oh my God,
[23:30.040 --> 23:31.040]  you're right about everything.
[23:31.040 --> 23:32.920]  What the hell is going on here?
[23:32.920 --> 23:36.720]  Hello, Ohio from the Justice Department.
[23:36.720 --> 23:38.480]  We will overcome Alex Jones.
[23:38.480 --> 23:40.680]  This is a quote and you will not help him.
[23:40.680 --> 23:42.280]  What do you mean we will not help him?
[23:42.280 --> 23:44.040]  He doesn't have access to federal courts.
[23:44.040 --> 23:45.040]  I'm going to stop.
[23:45.040 --> 23:48.040]  I'm going to stop him already going there.
[23:48.040 --> 23:49.560]  I mean I'm not even scared by this.
[23:49.560 --> 23:51.120]  I'm scared for everybody.
[23:51.120 --> 23:59.080]  This is crazy but they're all in their own bubble up there getting away with Hunter Biden
[23:59.080 --> 24:05.400]  and the Chinese spies and the cocaine and they're all just, just think they can do anything
[24:05.400 --> 24:17.120]  and you know what, if we let them we will be the new big ponderosa version of Venezuela
[24:17.120 --> 24:20.760]  but God help this country.
[24:20.760 --> 24:29.600]  I mean, I mean I can't even believe the stuff they do because obviously you know the rest
[24:29.600 --> 24:30.600]  equation.
[24:30.600 --> 24:35.720]  I haven't told you one-tenth of it but on its face folks, the executive branch contacting
[24:35.720 --> 24:44.080]  the legislative or the judicial branch and telling them to do things is not legal.
[24:44.080 --> 24:49.680]  But everything these people are doing, I mean I have LA Times saying well what's wrong
[24:49.680 --> 24:56.320]  with killing babies up to seven weeks or hell some people are staying up to three months.
[24:56.320 --> 24:59.760]  We show you a man on the street interviews with Mark Dice, he didn't edit those, I mean
[24:59.760 --> 25:03.720]  he just cut the spaces out, he talked to like 40 people and almost all of them said yeah
[25:03.720 --> 25:07.200]  let's kill babies up to a year old or 10 months.
[25:07.200 --> 25:15.040]  These people just because they have authority like Nero or Caligula or Stalin or Hitler
[25:15.040 --> 25:24.880]  or Fidel Castro or Mao Zedong or Genghis Khan, they just think that they are allowed to do
[25:24.880 --> 25:30.520]  whatever they want, however they want, whenever they want and it is, it's when you come face
[25:30.520 --> 25:36.560]  to face with that you're like wow we really are two minutes to midnight.
[25:36.560 --> 25:38.920]  I mean we really are screwed.
[25:38.920 --> 25:42.440]  But you know what, we brought on ourselves being asleep, putting up with being pushed
[25:42.440 --> 25:47.520]  around the rest of it and I want to just explain this slowly because I know our general audience
[25:47.520 --> 25:52.480]  gets it, we're on over 300 radio stations and over 100 cable and TV stations and new
[25:52.480 --> 25:54.960]  people are tuned through all the time, they're saying what are you talking about?
[25:54.960 --> 25:58.280]  You understand the IMF and World Bank control, almost all of Africa, almost all of Latin
[25:58.280 --> 26:04.480]  America, almost all of Asia and the Middle East, you can count on two hands countries
[26:04.480 --> 26:09.960]  aren't controlled by them and the great reset is about Western countries going under it,
[26:09.960 --> 26:14.840]  corrupting you so you've got to go into debt, when you cut the food off and cut people's
[26:14.840 --> 26:21.640]  jobs off in third world countries where if on average they go above 50% of their income
[26:21.640 --> 26:30.280]  for food, they die and then war breaks out, riots, it's a known fact, well already more
[26:30.280 --> 26:35.440]  than half the world's at about 60% of their paycheck is for food, artificially cutting
[26:35.440 --> 26:36.440]  it off.
[26:36.440 --> 26:43.120]  What do you think happens when they collapse, Latin America and the Middle East and areas
[26:43.120 --> 26:47.920]  of Asia and Africa, those people flood and it's the able-bodied men that can do it, they
[26:47.920 --> 26:52.520]  get organized at UN camps for three to six months, brainwashed, given blank credit cards,
[26:52.520 --> 26:56.520]  given contacts and then they're sent into Europe, they're sent to the US and they never
[26:56.520 --> 27:02.400]  get jobs, they're on welfare but they become these private political armies and underclasses
[27:02.400 --> 27:06.920]  of the globalist and then you see this where there's a law that okay well we at least even
[27:06.920 --> 27:10.760]  were to release somebody, we've got to make sure they have a kidnapped kids, we've got
[27:10.760 --> 27:14.640]  to make sure they don't have tuberculosis or scabies or you know any of these other
[27:14.640 --> 27:18.680]  horrible things, hemorrhagic fever, because I mean there's really a lot of deaths in
[27:18.680 --> 27:22.680]  the third world if you didn't know, go hang out in the third world slum in India or Latin
[27:22.680 --> 27:30.480]  America and see how sick you get, I mean it's bad, civilization and hygiene and running
[27:30.480 --> 27:33.880]  water, it's not everywhere, we used to be just as bad a hundred and something years
[27:33.880 --> 27:36.600]  ago that we got running water, that's what really cleaned things up, not the vaccines
[27:36.600 --> 27:43.480]  all the studies show, so you do that and you don't even, okay you're a man, you're a woman
[27:43.480 --> 27:46.560]  with five kids, we're not going to even look at your IDs and we're not going to stick a
[27:46.560 --> 27:50.160]  thermometer in your mouth, we're not going to even give you medicine, just get on buses
[27:50.160 --> 27:55.240]  and planes, you're into the US, well we're all micromanaged and told we've got to test
[27:55.240 --> 27:58.600]  you to get on a plane, we've got to test you to have a job, we've got to make you take
[27:58.600 --> 28:01.800]  all these experimental shots to do anything, we've got to have all your records, oh we
[28:01.800 --> 28:06.040]  got to, while they just flood us with these third world populations who are exempt from
[28:06.040 --> 28:10.240]  the shots and the mask, because under liability internationally that's cruel and unusual to
[28:10.240 --> 28:14.320]  make somebody take a shot or a mask, the UN won't even do its own dirty work and says
[28:14.320 --> 28:20.680]  we're worried about the shot, well they're the ones ordering it worldwide, so imagine
[28:20.680 --> 28:26.720]  no medical testing, no checking of IDs, no nothing, you can just come in and it's already
[28:26.720 --> 28:33.440]  been like that since Biden got in, ICE prepares for surge of migrants as Title 42 draws to
[28:33.440 --> 28:39.720]  close, that is just unbelievable, so they're not going to do that, but don't worry, you're
[28:39.720 --> 28:47.560]  going to pay for sex changes, which is really just mutilation and sterilization of the presence,
[28:47.560 --> 28:51.480]  I mean this is serious business, alright we've got some really good news, they'll only come
[28:51.480 --> 29:01.000]  back, we have the keys to victory, stay with us.

[32:05.120 --> 32:10.240]  and strong, I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[32:10.240 --> 32:14.880]  I was born for this, you were born for this, and people are really waking up right now,
[32:14.880 --> 32:19.840]  but we had to build our own infrastructure because of the censorship and de-platforming
[32:19.840 --> 32:24.200]  that cost tens of millions of dollars, and now, with Bandot video getting close to 10
[32:24.200 --> 32:28.880]  million views a day, we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists and
[32:28.880 --> 32:35.720]  groups to be able to post their content free of charge, and because it's become so successful,
[32:35.720 --> 32:38.000]  it's a catch-22.
[32:38.000 --> 32:43.480]  Info wars and Bandot video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide,
[32:43.480 --> 32:49.160]  but the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds
[32:49.160 --> 32:53.680]  of thousands of dollars a month, so the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now,
[32:53.680 --> 32:59.040]  the mega-emergency blowout sale up to 75% off, getting credible products, and keeping
[32:59.040 --> 33:01.480]  info wars as strong as ever.
[33:01.480 --> 33:21.680]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:21.680 --> 33:37.200]  So, I get attacked, conservatively, over 100 times a day in major newspapers and TV stations
[33:37.200 --> 33:41.120]  of local and national, not just counting farm ones, I can't even keep track of it.
[33:41.120 --> 33:47.480]  Some days it's 5,000 TV stations or more, because you can do Google alerts and get the
[33:47.480 --> 33:51.640]  numbers sent to you, imagine, oh, I have 5,000 today, oh, I have a thousand today, oh, I
[33:51.640 --> 33:57.320]  only have 100 today, sometimes I get the Google alerts, oh, I only have 75, it never drops
[33:57.320 --> 34:04.560]  below that, all lies, all garbage, just criminal, savage, gaslighting of the American people,
[34:04.560 --> 34:10.120]  and again, why under Trump, because he's attacked more than I am, why am I so attacked?
[34:10.120 --> 34:14.600]  Because I'm seen as a populist, as a real person that cares about people, I'm not perfect,
[34:14.600 --> 34:19.000]  but I tell the truth, and I love everybody, and I want justice, and I want prosperity,
[34:19.000 --> 34:24.840]  and I don't want infanticide of seven-day-old babies as California is trying to pass a law,
[34:24.840 --> 34:29.640]  and so they can't have anybody challenging their uncommon sense with our common sense,
[34:29.640 --> 34:35.840]  so I've talked about this a lot, dinosaur media is collapsing, not just Netflix, not
[34:35.840 --> 34:44.120]  just CNN+, not just CNN, all of it is collapsing, and we're led by a guy that gets orders from
[34:44.120 --> 34:47.880]  the Easter Bunny, as Trump said last night.
[34:47.880 --> 34:53.240]  And so what people need to understand is, when you see Tucker Carlson almost every week
[34:53.240 --> 34:58.600]  say Alex Jones is right, Alex Jones is good, or you see Mike Tyson say it, or Joe Rogan
[34:58.600 --> 35:03.560]  say it, or other people say it, they're saying it because they know the systems created me
[35:03.560 --> 35:10.560]  as a symbol of the populist being bad, and if they simply go along with that, they too
[35:10.560 --> 35:11.880]  will be destroyed.
[35:11.880 --> 35:16.200]  So Info Wars is like a Roman standard that the foreign armies are trying to capture and
[35:16.200 --> 35:17.360]  get, that's what I'm trying to tell you.
[35:17.360 --> 35:22.720]  I don't quite frankly like being this important, and I've been chosen by the enemy for destruction,
[35:22.720 --> 35:25.360]  but it's because you chose me for leadership.
[35:25.360 --> 35:30.400]  So I don't care about being famous, powerful, any of that, I care about winning and persevering
[35:30.400 --> 35:34.760]  and not backing down, and that's what I can't do without you.
[35:34.760 --> 35:38.720]  So it's so nice to have Mike Tyson come out and say nice things and talk about human sacrifice,
[35:38.720 --> 35:42.360]  now I'm right about that on Joe Rogan, and he's really a smart guy now, he's transcended
[35:42.360 --> 35:48.100]  really, as you say, born again, I mean as Christian, just a new person, and then you've
[35:48.100 --> 35:52.200]  also got, you know, he is somewhat Christian I would say, then you've got all these other
[35:52.200 --> 35:57.560]  people like Tucker Carlson talking about Info Wars, promoting it, because they understand
[35:57.560 --> 36:02.280]  that that's a symbol of populism and something the enemy's trying to destroy, and by counter
[36:02.280 --> 36:07.800]  veiling that, it shows the world it's an intimidation, it's a hoax, it's a fraud, that we should
[36:07.800 --> 36:12.560]  all stop being intimidated by the mouse that roared mainstream media, but the on average
[36:12.560 --> 36:16.840]  75-year-old member of Congress of the Senate still believes it's all powerful and is still
[36:16.840 --> 36:20.880]  scared of it, so as long as we're scared of the man behind the curtain, they have power
[36:20.880 --> 36:21.880]  over us.
[36:21.880 --> 36:26.200]  So here's Savannah, first giving us a shout out after the show, but also they're visiting
[36:26.200 --> 36:30.800]  Tucker in his studios in Florida, and then we'll go to the actual piece they had, and
[36:30.800 --> 36:33.280]  we've got Mike Tyson on Joe Rogan, here it is.
[36:33.280 --> 36:36.520]  Hi Alex, just wanted to send you a quick call.
[36:36.520 --> 36:42.760]  Alex, we were literally just slobbering all over you on camera, Alex Jones, he's so wonderful,
[36:42.760 --> 36:43.760]  how wonderful is he?
[36:43.760 --> 36:44.760]  We love Alex.
[36:44.760 --> 36:47.200]  And it was heartfelt too.
[36:47.200 --> 36:48.200]  Interesting.
[36:48.200 --> 36:49.880]  What did you think of Alex Jones?
[36:49.880 --> 36:54.280]  Loved him to death, and I still talk to him to this day, I think that he's great, and
[36:54.280 --> 37:00.640]  I think that many more people should have been vocal when he was initially banned, because
[37:00.640 --> 37:01.640]  I was actually there.
[37:01.640 --> 37:06.360]  I remember- I was on a fishing trip that day, and I was in Labrador, and I regretted it
[37:06.360 --> 37:10.200]  ever since that I didn't come out of the box, I wasn't there, I was off the air.
[37:10.200 --> 37:15.640]  But I completely agree, it was not even about Alex Jones, it's about you can't censor people,
[37:15.640 --> 37:16.640]  period.
[37:16.640 --> 37:17.640]  Exactly.
[37:17.640 --> 37:20.200]  And Tucker, I remember the exact day when he got censored, I woke up and I looked on
[37:20.200 --> 37:25.080]  my phone and it said, Alex Jones banned from YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, he
[37:25.080 --> 37:29.800]  was banned everywhere, it was a mass banning, mass censorship effort to silence him.
[37:29.800 --> 37:36.040]  And again, I really didn't have an introduction into politics, but I had learned a lot of things
[37:36.040 --> 37:40.320]  from Alex Jones up front, and everything that he was telling me was not false.
[37:40.320 --> 37:43.840]  The people who condemn him and say that he's a crazy conspiracy theorist do not listen
[37:43.840 --> 37:46.960]  to his show every single day, because I worked for him for two and a half years.
[37:46.960 --> 37:52.080]  I didn't know the three branches of government when I started, now I can tell you international
[37:52.080 --> 37:56.440]  policy and what's going on all over the world right now, because I have listened to Alex
[37:56.440 --> 38:00.600]  and he's talked about the government corruption, historically that we've been through all of
[38:00.600 --> 38:05.160]  the different operations, such as Operation Mockingbird, Operation Paperclip, a lot of
[38:05.160 --> 38:09.640]  these things, the Tuskegee experiment, which is why the black community is so apprehensive
[38:09.640 --> 38:11.560]  for vaccinations in the modern day.
[38:11.560 --> 38:15.440]  He talks about a lot of these things, and our government doesn't like that, our government
[38:15.440 --> 38:18.920]  doesn't like being exposed, they don't like people who are willing to tell the truth,
[38:18.920 --> 38:21.440]  and people who are willing to push back against the narrative.
[38:21.440 --> 38:26.120]  Look at the fact that the DHS just updated their bulletin to say, hey, if you're spreading
[38:26.120 --> 38:30.040]  distrust in the government, that could be considered terrorism.
[38:30.040 --> 38:31.040]  I don't think so.
[38:31.040 --> 38:35.560]  But I couldn't, of course, agree with you more, but I'm fascinated by the hate for
[38:35.560 --> 38:40.240]  Alex Jones, I'm not a daily Alex Jones viewer, I don't view anything regularly actually,
[38:40.240 --> 38:46.360]  but I think Alex Jones seems really talented, he's smart, he's funny as hell, he's truly
[38:46.360 --> 38:50.540]  funny, he's a lot more talented than I am in a lot of ways, that's my takeaway from
[38:50.540 --> 38:55.040]  Alex Jones, but why is he such a threat, like why would you hate Alex Jones, I've never
[38:55.040 --> 38:56.040]  understood that.
[38:56.040 --> 38:59.600]  Because he's telling the truth Tucker, and again, I know Alex personally and I've met
[38:59.600 --> 39:03.720]  a lot of people in this industry, and one of my biggest takeaways is that there are
[39:03.720 --> 39:07.680]  a lot of people, especially in conservative media, that are in this for money and fame,
[39:07.680 --> 39:11.160]  they don't actually care about this country, and they don't actually care about America,
[39:11.160 --> 39:14.440]  they're scared about being censored, they're scared about, you know, hurting the wrong
[39:14.440 --> 39:17.720]  people's feelings, not getting the proper endorsement, Alex doesn't care about any of
[39:17.720 --> 39:22.000]  that, Alex cares about the truth, he has since day one, he has made mistakes for sure, but
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.320]  he comes out, he apologizes for it, he corrects the record, which is something that many people
[39:26.320 --> 39:28.200]  in our media refuse to do.
[39:28.200 --> 39:32.520]  So the people who hate Alex Jones hate him, because he is everything that they wish that
[39:32.520 --> 39:36.480]  they could be, somebody who is willing to tell the truth, willing to fight for this
[39:36.480 --> 39:41.000]  country, and actually cares about humanity, not just America, but humanity as a whole.
[39:41.000 --> 39:46.440]  Yeah, he owns his own company and he has no advertisers, so he's kind of immune really,
[39:46.440 --> 39:52.400]  and the only way to stop him is by destroying him with lawsuits, forgiving his opinion, which
[39:52.400 --> 39:56.280]  I guess is now a crime or something in the United States, so they're trying to do it
[39:56.280 --> 39:57.280]  that way.
[39:57.280 --> 40:02.080]  I couldn't agree, I couldn't agree with you more, and why do you think, I've already
[40:02.080 --> 40:06.720]  said why I didn't defend Alex Jones the day he was de-platformed, I wasn't in the country,
[40:06.720 --> 40:11.160]  but why do you think that more in conservative media didn't take a principle stand against
[40:11.160 --> 40:13.040]  censorship when that happened?
[40:13.040 --> 40:17.200]  Because Alex was off limits, look at the fact that right now, Tucker, so many in conservative
[40:17.200 --> 40:21.360]  media who wouldn't even mention Alex Jones' name, now say his name on a regular basis,
[40:21.360 --> 40:26.120]  oh, Alex Jones is right, Alex Jones is right, we see this constantly, okay, the people in
[40:26.120 --> 40:30.840]  the conservative media, or in the right wing even, will not latch on to a specific narrative
[40:30.840 --> 40:34.600]  or tell the truth until it goes mainstream and they're allowed to do it.
[40:34.600 --> 40:40.240]  So even in the conservative and the right wing faction, the reason why we lose is because
[40:40.240 --> 40:44.800]  we continue to wait for the left, the liberal media, the mainstream media to allow us to
[40:44.800 --> 40:47.640]  tell us when we are allowed to tell the truth.
[40:47.640 --> 40:54.080]  Alex did that initially from day one, so I think that's why conservatives didn't stand
[40:54.080 --> 40:57.200]  up for him when they should have because they weren't allowed to at the time.
[40:57.200 --> 41:01.240]  I couldn't agree more, but you got to take a standing in censorship, I think, especially
[41:01.240 --> 41:05.560]  if you're in the media, I find Joy Reid loathsome, I think she's a race hater and she spreads
[41:05.560 --> 41:06.560]  race hate.
[41:06.560 --> 41:11.720]  However, if the government pushed for her to be censored, I would defend Joy Reid without
[41:11.720 --> 41:16.760]  even thinking about it, because I'm against that, period, I don't care who it is, period.
[41:16.760 --> 41:21.520]  And I don't know why national review can't take that stand, I think it's very, very odd.
[41:21.520 --> 41:25.080]  When we hired Savannah four years ago and she was here for three years, she was smart
[41:25.080 --> 41:26.080]  right out of college.
[41:26.080 --> 41:30.480]  But man, she is going to be a force to be reckoned with, she is already as articulate
[41:30.480 --> 41:35.240]  as myself or Tucker Carlson is, and Tucker, I would say, for the genuineness and the charming
[41:35.240 --> 41:37.720]  and the great brain, he's better than me in many ways.
[41:37.720 --> 41:38.720]  I was a nice compliment.
[41:38.720 --> 41:42.600]  You know, he gave me there saying that he's, you know, that I'm, quote, better on there
[41:42.600 --> 41:44.600]  than that's not true.
[41:44.600 --> 41:46.840]  The issue is we're all different and that's how God made us.
[41:46.840 --> 41:50.440]  But together we make the world really an amazing place when good people stand up.
[41:50.440 --> 41:55.240]  But if people should take that four minute clip that's on infowars.com, I don't think
[41:55.240 --> 41:56.240]  it's even on infowars.com.
[41:56.240 --> 42:00.880]  We never promote ourselves, but I'll get an article out tomorrow or I'll have that clip
[42:00.880 --> 42:05.680]  posted under the live show feed with today's show title that's on info wars.
[42:05.680 --> 42:09.400]  You can see it and share it because she totally gets it.
[42:09.400 --> 42:10.400]  We're all intimidated.
[42:10.400 --> 42:12.080]  We let the left make the rules.
[42:12.080 --> 42:18.360]  We get in line hoping they don't censor us and it's all Pavlovian dog training.
[42:18.360 --> 42:22.060]  The more you give in, the worst it gets.
[42:22.060 --> 42:27.400]  And if we all just start saying what we want and doing what we want and not being intimidated
[42:27.400 --> 42:29.880]  by these people, we're going to win.
[42:29.880 --> 42:30.880]  We got to be smart about it.
[42:30.880 --> 42:34.880]  We got to tell the truth, but we got to stop bowing and groveling to these people.
[42:34.880 --> 42:38.680]  I didn't get to the Mike Tyson, Joe Rogan club and I got drew Hernandez coming up, but I'll
[42:38.680 --> 42:40.560]  get that posted on the side as well.
[42:40.560 --> 42:44.760]  And once we post this to the archival, have it added in post and who knows, I might get
[42:44.760 --> 42:45.760]  to it next hour.
[42:45.760 --> 42:49.560]  You know, Mike Tyson said, you're not supposed to like Alex Jones, but I love him.
[42:49.560 --> 42:50.560]  That's what they're scared of.
[42:50.560 --> 42:54.520]  And people get that to the revolutionaries is they want to shut Alex Jones down because
[42:54.520 --> 42:56.080]  they want to shut you down.
[42:56.080 --> 42:58.760]  It's key to support info wars.
[42:58.760 --> 43:03.240]  It's about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand info wars.
[43:03.240 --> 43:07.520]  I've been on the air a couple of years, but I only had money to finance my own simple little
[43:07.520 --> 43:08.520]  local radio show.
[43:08.520 --> 43:12.160]  And I wanted to hire camera people, I wanted to make films, I wanted to really challenge
[43:12.160 --> 43:13.160]  the globalist.
[43:13.160 --> 43:18.440]  And it was a t-shirt I designed the first one mass murderers agreed gun control works
[43:18.440 --> 43:22.160]  that helped us finance hiring the first two members of my crew.
[43:22.160 --> 43:24.520]  That's our oldest design and we still sell it.
[43:24.520 --> 43:29.080]  We have that design over a hundred others that will now all be limited editions because
[43:29.080 --> 43:34.120]  whatever stock we've got in, that's that we're selling everything out to find the operation
[43:34.120 --> 43:35.120]  to get rid of inventory.
[43:35.120 --> 43:38.800]  We'll still have some teachers in the future, they'll just be limited editions and short
[43:38.800 --> 43:39.800]  runs.
[43:39.800 --> 43:44.440]  If you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last chance, I almost forgot.
[43:44.440 --> 43:48.280]  We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.
[43:48.280 --> 43:53.960]  Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie, every long sleeve, every t-shirt, regular shirts,
[43:53.960 --> 43:59.640]  designer shirts, they're all selling at cost infowarstore.com.
[43:59.640 --> 44:01.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[44:01.520 --> 44:04.960]  I need your help keeping info wars on the air and strong.
[44:04.960 --> 44:08.960]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[44:08.960 --> 44:13.480]  I was born for this, you were born for this and people are really waking up right now
[44:13.480 --> 44:18.600]  but we had to build our own infrastructure because of the censorship and de-platforming
[44:18.600 --> 44:20.320]  that cost tens of millions of dollars.
[44:20.320 --> 44:25.000]  And now, with Band-Aught Video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform
[44:25.000 --> 44:30.840]  for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free
[44:30.840 --> 44:31.840]  of charge.
[44:31.840 --> 44:36.720]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch-22.
[44:36.720 --> 44:41.200]  Info wars and Band-Aught Video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty
[44:41.200 --> 44:42.200]  movement worldwide.
[44:42.200 --> 44:47.880]  But the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds
[44:47.880 --> 44:49.880]  of thousands of dollars a month.
[44:49.880 --> 44:53.600]  So, the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now, the mega emergency blowout
[44:53.600 --> 44:59.040]  sale up to 75% off, getting incredible products and keeping info wars as strong as ever.
[44:59.040 --> 45:03.600]  You know, it's a fact and I'm not bragging when I say it, it's just true that info wars
[45:03.600 --> 45:11.640]  is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty, as the logo of human populist
[45:11.640 --> 45:16.320]  resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program.
[45:16.320 --> 45:23.160]  And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever
[45:23.160 --> 45:24.160]  done.
[45:24.160 --> 45:30.160]  So, I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them at infowarstore.com
[45:30.160 --> 45:35.280]  and we are funded by listeners and viewers like you and so now we need to support more
[45:35.280 --> 45:41.560]  than ever because this fight has intensified, don't need me to tell you that at infowarstore.com.
[45:41.560 --> 45:46.720]  We've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now, things have been sold out for a long
[45:46.720 --> 45:51.960]  time like info wars life, fizzy magnesium mix that's so amazing, and our new immune
[45:51.960 --> 45:58.560]  support formula that's so critical, they're all available 25 to 75% off at infowarstore.com
[45:58.560 --> 45:59.560]  right now.
[45:59.560 --> 46:04.080]  The eugenicists over a hundred years ago were very public about their plans, they financed
[46:04.080 --> 46:09.920]  major universities, they ran full page stories and advertisements pushing their propaganda
[46:09.920 --> 46:14.840]  of the New York Times, other major newspapers, that the family as we know it is a bad thing
[46:14.840 --> 46:16.320]  and must be ended.
[46:16.320 --> 46:21.920]  And the first step in that is getting women out of the household and teaching women that
[46:21.920 --> 46:25.960]  cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing.
[46:25.960 --> 46:30.840]  And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four natural daughter,
[46:30.840 --> 46:34.840]  my wife makes dinner a lot of times, but I like to make it as well, I love to make breakfast.
[46:34.840 --> 46:39.840]  And literally it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be nurturative
[46:39.840 --> 46:43.400]  and then all sit down together and have that communal event.
[46:43.400 --> 46:49.480]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding, is our normal biological actions
[46:49.480 --> 46:50.480]  and coming together.
[46:50.480 --> 46:55.960]  We really are sick, evil scientific cult of filth and want to domesticate us and turn
[46:55.960 --> 47:01.840]  us into lab rats, we cannot let this continue.
[47:01.840 --> 47:23.760]  Beginning of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:23.760 --> 47:29.280]  It's Sunday, April 24th, 2022, we're not supposed to be on air right now.
[47:29.280 --> 47:35.080]  We're supposed to be silenced by big globalist corporations led by BlackRock and Vanguard.
[47:35.080 --> 47:39.280]  Gaslight us all and say that they're going to have a sexual relationship with your children.
[47:39.280 --> 47:44.320]  They're going to have pregnant men emojis, they're going to open our borders up, not
[47:44.320 --> 47:47.640]  do any medical checks, but you're going to do a medical check to get on a bus or plane.
[47:47.640 --> 47:52.680]  Yeah, it's a criminal takeover to see what you'll put up with, to see what these monsters
[47:52.680 --> 47:54.320]  can get away with.
[47:54.320 --> 47:57.640]  And they are attacking our free speech everywhere, they're not just trying to shut inforwars
[47:57.640 --> 47:58.640]  down.
[47:58.640 --> 48:03.040]  And Twitter bans ads that contradict science on climate change.
[48:03.040 --> 48:07.200]  The definition of science is that anybody can challenge it and that anybody can question
[48:07.200 --> 48:08.200]  it.
[48:08.200 --> 48:12.720]  If it's so strong that carbon dioxide is a deadly gas that kills everything, and that's
[48:12.720 --> 48:19.080]  not true, it's a life-giving gas, then why don't they just let you challenge?
[48:19.080 --> 48:23.040]  They don't let you challenge that two men can have a baby on Twitter or Instagram because
[48:23.040 --> 48:26.280]  it's a lie, because it's a fraud.
[48:26.280 --> 48:31.240]  And now Judge Dismiss's lawsuit trying to bar Representative Paul Gosar, Andy Biggs
[48:31.240 --> 48:36.880]  from running for reelection, but it's going forward in Georgia against MTG and I saw the
[48:36.880 --> 48:45.200]  clip where they say to her, why did you call Pelosi a traitor?
[48:45.200 --> 48:52.880]  Oh, and I was like, ooh, you should be barred from running because you're a traitor.
[48:52.880 --> 48:57.080]  Pelosi and the Democrats called for physically attacking Republicans and said burning down
[48:57.080 --> 48:58.960]  cities is mostly peaceful.
[48:58.960 --> 49:04.640]  I mean, yes, the Democrats are traitors, yes, Biden having secret meetings with Communist
[49:04.640 --> 49:11.160]  Chinese leaders with his father in the White House, now mainstream news is big news.
[49:11.160 --> 49:16.640]  Yeah, that's what traitors are, Diane Feinstein having her offices run by a known Chinese
[49:16.640 --> 49:20.240]  agent, Swallows well being penetrated by a Chinese agent.
[49:20.240 --> 49:27.720]  We know that, but oh, we're the traitors for calling them traitors.
[49:27.720 --> 49:33.280]  And now we have to be banned from running from office because Marjorie Taylor Greene
[49:33.280 --> 49:38.840]  said they want to stop voters will, and they're like, we'll show you, you can't say we want
[49:38.840 --> 49:42.320]  to steal elections, you're not allowed to run, you're too popular.
[49:42.320 --> 49:45.360]  Wow, what an attempt at power, but why not?
[49:45.360 --> 49:50.120]  They're passing bills everywhere to kill babies for weeks or months after they're born.
[49:50.120 --> 49:55.040]  I mean, there's no bottom to these people drew Hernandez is on a whole bunch of platforms
[49:55.040 --> 50:00.800]  reporter for a lot of big outfits drew h live on Twitter drew h live.com.
[50:00.800 --> 50:05.000]  He's the best kid reporter commentator and host of front line and drew Hernandez live
[50:05.000 --> 50:06.000]  a good friend of mine.
[50:06.000 --> 50:10.760]  He's got a lot to talk about today on the Pito grooming gangs next hour and more ahead
[50:10.760 --> 50:14.240]  of Robert Barnes and a powerful interview coming up, but front and center.
[50:14.240 --> 50:20.640]  This attempt, the oxymoronic move that if you say we're trying to not let you elect people,
[50:20.640 --> 50:21.640]  you can't run for office.
[50:21.640 --> 50:25.880]  I mean, it's just, it looks like saying, are you saying I'm a murderer?
[50:25.880 --> 50:26.880]  Of course I murder people.
[50:26.880 --> 50:27.880]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[50:27.880 --> 50:30.640]  What do you say to that?
[50:30.640 --> 50:31.960]  I think it's pretty clear, Alex.
[50:31.960 --> 50:36.120]  I think we're seeing what we've been talking about what you've been talking about for decades
[50:36.120 --> 50:41.000]  is the fall of the Republic, this infiltration of globalism where they want to destroy any
[50:41.000 --> 50:45.760]  shape or form of nationalism for the American people, not just politicians.
[50:45.760 --> 50:47.560]  And this is what people need to understand.
[50:47.560 --> 50:51.800]  A few years ago, Alex, it was you, you were in the hot seat, you've been the trailblazer
[50:51.800 --> 50:52.800]  from the beginning.
[50:52.800 --> 50:56.680]  They decided to target you in info wars because that's what you represented.
[50:56.680 --> 50:59.240]  Nobody thought that they would go after Trump just as harshly.
[50:59.240 --> 51:00.240]  They did.
[51:00.240 --> 51:02.080]  They de-platformed a sitting United States president.
[51:02.080 --> 51:06.560]  They silenced and censored him immediately because he represented the whole populist
[51:06.560 --> 51:07.560]  movement.
[51:07.560 --> 51:10.040]  And what people need to understand, they're going to continue to do this.
[51:10.040 --> 51:14.800]  This is why they're going after Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene because she's a continuation
[51:14.800 --> 51:16.200]  of the populist movement.
[51:16.200 --> 51:18.280]  And you take a look at that kangaroo court.
[51:18.280 --> 51:22.520]  If we can even call it a hearing, Alex, they're sitting there saying, oh, you, you, you said
[51:22.520 --> 51:24.680]  we are not going to go quietly into the night.
[51:24.680 --> 51:28.800]  Did you, uh, did you steal lines from that movie Independence Day?
[51:28.800 --> 51:29.880]  It's literally a joke.
[51:29.880 --> 51:36.560]  They want to literally paint anybody that wears a shirt that says 1776 or July 4th or
[51:36.560 --> 51:41.000]  the 4th of July or anything that's pro-americana or freedom, they are literally going to label
[51:41.000 --> 51:44.400]  you as a domestic terrorist in the United States of America.
[51:44.400 --> 51:45.400]  It's backwards.
[51:45.400 --> 51:48.800]  And this is where people need to understand because I know a lot of people sit back and
[51:48.800 --> 51:51.080]  they, they watch what happens to you, Alex.
[51:51.080 --> 51:53.400]  They watch what happens to Joe Rogan, these big guys.
[51:53.400 --> 51:55.760]  And it's like, you know what, they're probably going to make it.
[51:55.760 --> 51:56.760]  They're going to be fine.
[51:56.760 --> 51:59.720]  But what's happening is we are all Alex Jones.
[51:59.720 --> 52:01.520]  We are all Joe Rogan.
[52:01.520 --> 52:03.360]  We are all MTG.
[52:03.360 --> 52:07.400]  We are all everyone that's getting silenced and censored in the United States of America,
[52:07.400 --> 52:09.440]  whether you're on the left or the right.
[52:09.440 --> 52:12.920]  This is about totalitarian control and all the leftists out there.
[52:12.920 --> 52:17.720]  This will prove my point, Alex, you were, you were never this hardcore right winger.
[52:17.720 --> 52:22.920]  You got arrested for protesting and going after George W. Bush in the 2000s.
[52:22.920 --> 52:26.080]  You, you, you, Joe Rogan was never this hard right winger.
[52:26.080 --> 52:30.160]  I mean, even Tim Pool, they come out and say Tim Pool is an alt right YouTuber.
[52:30.160 --> 52:32.360]  The guy's a hardcore classical liberal.
[52:32.360 --> 52:33.360]  What's my point?
[52:33.360 --> 52:37.040]  My point is this, it doesn't matter what side you find yourself on.
[52:37.040 --> 52:39.480]  These people just want one thing.
[52:39.480 --> 52:40.480]  It's power.
[52:40.480 --> 52:45.400]  It's power and control of your mind and your life and people need to just set aside their
[52:45.400 --> 52:50.200]  political differences and see that they're literally intentionally pinning us against
[52:50.200 --> 52:51.200]  each other.
[52:51.200 --> 52:52.640]  They want to spark a civil war.
[52:52.640 --> 52:57.120]  So they have an excuse for complete total government overreach to control every single
[52:57.120 --> 52:58.120]  one of us.
[52:58.120 --> 53:03.000]  At this point, Alex, that is not a conspiracy theory that is quickly becoming reality and
[53:03.000 --> 53:04.200]  we're watching it unfold.
[53:04.200 --> 53:05.800]  It is in the process right now.
[53:05.800 --> 53:06.800]  It's being installed.
[53:06.800 --> 53:07.800]  Well, that's right.
[53:07.800 --> 53:09.440]  With tyrants, a couple of things can happen.
[53:09.440 --> 53:14.440]  People wake up to it and stop it or the tyrants take over and get so crazy, they collapse
[53:14.440 --> 53:16.520]  everything and destroy their own system.
[53:16.520 --> 53:22.280]  But then sometimes like Cuba or Venezuela or North Korea or China can go on 50, 60,
[53:22.280 --> 53:27.520]  70 years and the people are just in perpetual slavery because the nation has so many resources
[53:27.520 --> 53:32.800]  and the people just keep working through it and if you imagine America fully captured
[53:32.800 --> 53:37.160]  by that what it's going to be like, it just does not sound like a fun place.
[53:37.160 --> 53:38.160]  We are being destabilized.
[53:38.160 --> 53:41.680]  I mean, the great reset is in full motion and I think a lot of people when they hear the
[53:41.680 --> 53:46.360]  term great reset, it's not just an economic agenda that's on the surface.
[53:46.360 --> 53:48.640]  Of course, they want to just take away the middle class.
[53:48.640 --> 53:49.640]  They want peasants.
[53:49.640 --> 53:52.680]  They want the elites at the top and that's what they're systemically doing.
[53:52.680 --> 53:57.880]  Not only in the United States, but across the entire globe, but it's also a great reset,
[53:57.880 --> 54:02.000]  build back better, this globalist agenda that hits the heart as well.
[54:02.000 --> 54:04.360]  And we're starting to see this with Disney as well.
[54:04.360 --> 54:08.600]  We've been seeing this with the LGBTQ, this woke agenda that's been targeting children.
[54:08.600 --> 54:13.280]  Now, out in the open, these people are literally opposing an anti-child grooming law.
[54:13.280 --> 54:16.720]  This same agenda is also a moral agenda as well.
[54:16.720 --> 54:20.840]  They want people totally depraved of God, of morality.
[54:20.840 --> 54:22.400]  They don't want anybody with morals.
[54:22.400 --> 54:26.600]  They don't want anybody to tell the difference between left or right, right or wrong anymore,
[54:26.600 --> 54:27.600]  up and down.
[54:27.600 --> 54:31.680]  They want everything backwards so that you will just accept anything they put in front
[54:31.680 --> 54:32.680]  of you.
[54:32.680 --> 54:33.680]  Andrew Hernandez, you're always on fire.
[54:33.680 --> 54:37.200]  I want you to expand on that, but it's very simple at its core.
[54:37.200 --> 54:41.120]  If we're isolated, if we're depraved, we won't stand up for others.
[54:41.120 --> 54:42.680]  They won't stand up for us.
[54:42.680 --> 54:44.960]  And now we are isolated prey.
[54:44.960 --> 54:52.760]  Being depraved, immoral, lazy, dumb, satanic idiots is the devil setting you up for destruction.
[54:52.760 --> 54:57.160]  And it's very simple, and there's just, where do you see all this going?
[54:57.160 --> 54:58.880]  It's just getting crazy.
[54:58.880 --> 55:00.760]  Like everything they do is collapsing.
[55:00.760 --> 55:02.280]  No one's buying into them.
[55:02.280 --> 55:04.080]  CNN's gone.
[55:04.080 --> 55:07.320]  No one's watching any of it, but then they just keep doubling down.
[55:07.320 --> 55:09.120]  Biden's led around by the Easter Bunny.
[55:09.120 --> 55:12.600]  I mean, I feel like I took 10 hits of acid here, brother.
[55:12.600 --> 55:16.160]  Absolutely, I think everybody's starting to feel like that, Alex, because people are
[55:16.160 --> 55:22.000]  beginning to wake up and realize that everything that people were saying a few years ago about
[55:22.000 --> 55:26.960]  these totalitarian globalist agendas taking over the United States are coming to fruition
[55:26.960 --> 55:29.760]  and they're coming true because it is real.
[55:29.760 --> 55:31.520]  So I think people are going to wake up.
[55:31.520 --> 55:33.440]  We've been seeing the populist movement grow.
[55:33.440 --> 55:37.800]  A lot of people are exiting the Democrat party, they'll say, or they're exiting the woke mob
[55:37.800 --> 55:41.880]  or exiting these woke agendas and getting away from these things and just coming back
[55:41.880 --> 55:43.000]  to sanity.
[55:43.000 --> 55:46.120]  But they want to paint that as like right wing, neo-Nazi organizations.
[55:46.120 --> 55:47.240]  That's what they do.
[55:47.240 --> 55:49.440]  But I think more people are going to wake up, Alex.
[55:49.440 --> 55:54.800]  And my hope is, my hope is that it doesn't get worse before it gets better because sometimes
[55:54.800 --> 55:59.160]  in history you can see God working this way where people are either going to listen and
[55:59.160 --> 56:01.760]  they're going to learn one of two ways, Alex.
[56:01.760 --> 56:05.680]  They're either going to learn by wisdom and experience or they're just going to learn
[56:05.680 --> 56:08.200]  by knowledge and listening of what not to do.
[56:08.200 --> 56:12.480]  So I hope we don't have to continue to go down this dark path where I don't know, Alex,
[56:12.480 --> 56:16.400]  is Disney just going to start pushing out open child pornography?
[56:16.400 --> 56:18.400]  Is that when we're going to draw the line, Alex?
[56:18.400 --> 56:19.840]  That's not when we draw the line.
[56:19.840 --> 56:23.760]  We don't draw the line when they're openly creating child porn and pushing it out and
[56:23.760 --> 56:26.160]  shoving it down your mouth and saying, you must accept this.
[56:26.160 --> 56:27.480]  If you don't, you're a bigot.
[56:27.480 --> 56:28.960]  That's not when we draw the line, Alex.
[56:28.960 --> 56:33.520]  We draw the line now because they're opposing child grooming laws.
[56:33.520 --> 56:34.600]  People need to understand.
[56:34.600 --> 56:39.960]  They need to support people that get this stuff, especially infowars in banned out video.
[56:39.960 --> 56:45.040]  We don't wait until infowars is gone to finally wake up and say, hey, they're at the tip of
[56:45.040 --> 56:46.040]  the spear.
[56:46.040 --> 56:47.160]  Maybe we should have supported them.
[56:47.160 --> 56:48.160]  Where can I donate now?
[56:48.160 --> 56:49.160]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[56:49.160 --> 56:50.160]  Infowars is gone.
[56:50.160 --> 56:51.680]  You cannot go to a donate button anymore.
[56:51.680 --> 56:55.960]  We need to support patriots that get this and that are pushing back right now.
[56:55.960 --> 56:56.960]  And now is the time, Alex.
[56:56.960 --> 56:57.960]  We cannot wait.
[56:57.960 --> 57:02.640]  Drew, man, I tell you, I've known you for four or five years, but you are really fired
[57:02.640 --> 57:06.200]  up and just on point with all of this.
[57:06.200 --> 57:07.200]  We're going to go to break.
[57:07.200 --> 57:08.200]  We're going to come back.
[57:08.200 --> 57:11.280]  You sent me some clips, and I've seen a lot of these, but these are some of the works
[57:11.280 --> 57:16.440]  I hadn't seen these, of educators and others saying, look, we're going to form a sexual
[57:16.440 --> 57:22.280]  relationship with your child, and we're going to come after your little girls, particularly.
[57:22.280 --> 57:25.000]  And you're just watching this, and it's surreal.
[57:25.000 --> 57:26.000]  You can't believe what's happening.
[57:26.000 --> 57:27.920]  We're going to play it, folks.
[57:27.920 --> 57:33.200]  You want to see these demons bragging that we're your teachers.
[57:33.200 --> 57:34.360]  You can't stop us.
[57:34.360 --> 57:37.200]  We have your kids bragging while you're at work.
[57:37.200 --> 57:38.200]  Your kids online.
[57:38.200 --> 57:39.200]  We're going to get your kid.
[57:39.200 --> 57:40.400]  They actually say it.
[57:40.400 --> 57:42.880]  We're going to get your child.
[57:42.880 --> 57:46.040]  I mean, these people are out in the open and emboldened.

[59:45.560 --> 59:46.560]  Take action now.
[59:46.560 --> 59:47.560]  InfowarsTour.com.
[59:47.560 --> 1:00:10.560]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:00:10.560 --> 1:00:24.080]  All right, dude, this is a short segment, long segment coming up, you know, the pedo
[1:00:24.080 --> 1:00:27.360]  groomers and how they're just, they're not out of the closet.
[1:00:27.360 --> 1:00:28.360]  They're in our living rooms.
[1:00:28.360 --> 1:00:29.360]  They're in our classrooms.
[1:00:29.360 --> 1:00:31.160]  They're saying, we're grooming your children.
[1:00:31.160 --> 1:00:32.560]  We're coming for them everywhere.
[1:00:32.560 --> 1:00:36.960]  We'll talk about the segment, but what do you make of Biden being led around by the Easter
[1:00:36.960 --> 1:00:41.360]  Bunny and just by the collapse of confidence in him?
[1:00:41.360 --> 1:00:45.520]  And what are they going to do in the midterms in 198 days?
[1:00:45.520 --> 1:00:50.000]  I think it's pretty clear, Alex, that what they needed, this is exactly what they needed.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:54.960]  And this is what the far left, the Democrats and the globalist agenda and leaders needed
[1:00:54.960 --> 1:00:56.960]  in the United States of America.
[1:00:56.960 --> 1:01:00.960]  They needed the polar opposite of what President Donald Trump was.
[1:01:00.960 --> 1:01:02.600]  President Donald Trump was not controllable.
[1:01:02.600 --> 1:01:03.920]  You couldn't pay him off.
[1:01:03.920 --> 1:01:04.920]  You couldn't buy him off.
[1:01:04.920 --> 1:01:08.240]  I mean, he was deceived with Operation Warp Speed and all that other stuff.
[1:01:08.240 --> 1:01:12.880]  But what President Biden is, if we can even call him that, he's a puppet president.
[1:01:12.880 --> 1:01:20.520]  What he is, is a total controllable hollow shell of a human being that is completely
[1:01:20.520 --> 1:01:21.520]  controllable.
[1:01:21.520 --> 1:01:23.840]  I mean, that is what we've been seeing since day one.
[1:01:23.840 --> 1:01:25.240]  He's losing his mind.
[1:01:25.240 --> 1:01:26.880]  He's totally senile.
[1:01:26.880 --> 1:01:29.120]  He's obviously suffering from dementia.
[1:01:29.120 --> 1:01:31.000]  And I think that's exactly what they needed.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:35.840]  They needed someone that has no morality, that doesn't even have a brain that is totally
[1:01:35.840 --> 1:01:36.840]  controllable.
[1:01:36.840 --> 1:01:38.360]  So there's no pushback.
[1:01:38.360 --> 1:01:41.160]  There's literally nothing that's going to say no to what they want.
[1:01:41.160 --> 1:01:44.600]  No one's going to stop what they're demanding, what they want at the southern border with
[1:01:44.600 --> 1:01:49.040]  the great reset, destroying the economy with everything taking place culturally and morally
[1:01:49.040 --> 1:01:53.200]  in the United States of America with these grooming agendas, all unfolding the lawlessness
[1:01:53.200 --> 1:01:57.360]  that continues to abound with the defund the police agenda and innocence being destroyed
[1:01:57.360 --> 1:01:58.500]  and decimated.
[1:01:58.500 --> 1:02:03.560]  They needed a leader that was not going to question or push back on any of that, but
[1:02:03.560 --> 1:02:06.280]  was just going to do as he is told.
[1:02:06.280 --> 1:02:09.760]  And that is exactly what you're seeing with this puppet president in the United States
[1:02:09.760 --> 1:02:15.520]  of America, because that is the perfect candidate, the perfect person in order to unfold an agenda
[1:02:15.520 --> 1:02:16.520]  like this.
[1:02:16.520 --> 1:02:18.920]  But at the same time, Biden knows what he's doing.
[1:02:18.920 --> 1:02:20.840]  I mean, he's been around for a long time.
[1:02:20.840 --> 1:02:26.160]  He's still a little old satanic daemon, exactly, as you can see deteriorating.
[1:02:26.160 --> 1:02:27.280]  So let me ask you this.
[1:02:27.280 --> 1:02:29.520]  He's happy to get blamed for the whole agenda later.
[1:02:29.520 --> 1:02:30.520]  He's so soulless.
[1:02:30.520 --> 1:02:31.520]  I really respect you.
[1:02:31.520 --> 1:02:32.840]  You're one of the smartest people I know.
[1:02:32.840 --> 1:02:34.320]  Let me ask you this.
[1:02:34.320 --> 1:02:37.080]  They're openly promoting and fantasizing of already born babies.
[1:02:37.080 --> 1:02:38.760]  They're openly promoting pedophilia now.
[1:02:38.760 --> 1:02:39.760]  What comes next?
[1:02:39.760 --> 1:02:42.040]  I mean, this seems to be no bottom to this.
[1:02:42.040 --> 1:02:46.480]  I guess the Democrats are now endorsing nuclear war, saying kill all humans.
[1:02:46.480 --> 1:02:49.760]  I mean, where do they go next?
[1:02:49.760 --> 1:02:51.320]  I think that's what you see, Alex.
[1:02:51.320 --> 1:02:54.000]  I mean, we are literally living in Romans chapter one.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:59.040]  If you take a look at the Bible, it has clearly laid out where we are right now.
[1:02:59.040 --> 1:03:04.960]  With total depravity, you're seeing the LGBTQ agenda just completely overtake our entire
[1:03:04.960 --> 1:03:06.600]  society and culture.
[1:03:06.600 --> 1:03:09.520]  And now it's going after children and sexualizing children.
[1:03:09.520 --> 1:03:14.480]  So along with that, when you read Romans chapter one, Alex, you see just total lawlessness.
[1:03:14.480 --> 1:03:16.080]  You see murder abounding.
[1:03:16.080 --> 1:03:17.080]  You see all these.
[1:03:17.080 --> 1:03:18.080]  That's right.
[1:03:18.080 --> 1:03:20.200]  It describes it as children are in charge of their parents.
[1:03:20.200 --> 1:03:21.200]  Everything's collapsing.
[1:03:21.200 --> 1:03:22.200]  Nothing works.
[1:03:22.200 --> 1:03:23.200]  Everyone's poisoned.
[1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:27.560]  As the evil just get more and more evil and finally run off the edge of cliffs.
[1:03:27.560 --> 1:03:29.320]  But here's the crazy part, Alex.
[1:03:29.320 --> 1:03:34.520]  The reason why we call it theologically total depravity is because that means it becomes
[1:03:34.520 --> 1:03:37.960]  normal in the minds of the individuals that are depraved.
[1:03:37.960 --> 1:03:43.520]  We are moving into a society where open pedophilia is going to be accepted and normalized.
[1:03:43.520 --> 1:03:49.200]  We are moving towards a society where murder is going to be openly celebrated and normalized,
[1:03:49.200 --> 1:03:54.280]  where all of these things that are obvious crimes and horrors against humanity, whether
[1:03:54.280 --> 1:03:58.600]  it's children, women or men, all of these things that we obviously would take a look
[1:03:58.600 --> 1:04:00.960]  at as normal, sane people and say, Hey, that's wrong.
[1:04:00.960 --> 1:04:01.960]  That's evil.
[1:04:01.960 --> 1:04:05.200]  They should be prosecuted and thrown in jail for all of eternity, right?
[1:04:05.200 --> 1:04:09.560]  We're moving towards a society where those things become normalized and Alex Jesus made
[1:04:09.560 --> 1:04:13.960]  this very clear that in the last days, lawlessness will abound.
[1:04:13.960 --> 1:04:16.800]  He didn't say it might abound that it will abound.
[1:04:16.800 --> 1:04:18.760]  And here we are in 2022.
[1:04:18.760 --> 1:04:21.520]  It doesn't mean we stick our heads in the sand and say, Oh, well, Jesus is going to
[1:04:21.520 --> 1:04:22.520]  come back.
[1:04:22.520 --> 1:04:24.680]  Let's just chill and wait for him and enjoy the show.
[1:04:24.680 --> 1:04:26.120]  No, because we don't know.
[1:04:26.120 --> 1:04:30.240]  He may not come back for another 20, 25 years, 30, 100 years.
[1:04:30.240 --> 1:04:33.040]  Right now we have to stand for righteousness as the Bible and God.
[1:04:33.040 --> 1:04:34.040]  You're totally right.
[1:04:34.040 --> 1:04:37.480]  And when we stand for the white throne judgment, if we didn't fight evil, God's going to say,
[1:04:37.480 --> 1:04:38.960]  I don't know you.
[1:04:38.960 --> 1:04:39.960]  Absolutely.
[1:04:39.960 --> 1:04:40.960]  All right.
[1:04:40.960 --> 1:04:41.960]  We'll be right back.
[1:04:41.960 --> 1:04:46.760]  Drew Hernandez, we're going to get into the pedo grooming operations that have just
[1:04:46.760 --> 1:04:54.120]  gone stratospheric, Disney, DeSantis and more info wars.com tomorrow's news today.

[1:05:27.760 --> 1:05:32.280]  half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps.
[1:05:32.280 --> 1:05:37.240]  The traders know they can shut us down by force, but that would accelerate the awakening
[1:05:37.240 --> 1:05:38.240]  exponentially.
[1:05:38.240 --> 1:05:40.360]  So be it.
[1:05:40.360 --> 1:05:42.720]  Make them silence us by force.
[1:05:42.720 --> 1:05:45.760]  This is the final battle of the information war.

[1:06:28.400 --> 1:06:32.920]  And you know, I've known him for years and I just see him getting more on fire than ever.
[1:06:32.920 --> 1:06:37.040]  Tucker Carlson getting more on fire, Savannah Hernandez, we're talking about last hour.
[1:06:37.040 --> 1:06:39.440]  She just is like getting smarter than I am.
[1:06:39.440 --> 1:06:45.480]  She's exponential as free humanity and everybody else I know is either getting dumber or smarter.
[1:06:45.480 --> 1:06:49.120]  They're either getting more awake or more in delusion.
[1:06:49.120 --> 1:06:50.680]  That really is biblical.
[1:06:50.680 --> 1:06:52.400]  So Dr. Hernandez, I've got a few of these clips.
[1:06:52.400 --> 1:06:57.040]  You sent me a bunch and I've seen hundreds of these, but I hadn't seen these new ones
[1:06:57.040 --> 1:07:03.000]  and that's just so disgusting to look at the weird satanic things in their eyes.
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:11.080]  And LGBTQP YouTubers, TikTok creators claim, all your children belong to us and we will
[1:07:11.080 --> 1:07:13.080]  raise your children just right.
[1:07:13.080 --> 1:07:16.320]  And they say, thank God you let them online, we've got them now.
[1:07:16.320 --> 1:07:22.480]  Florida teacher says she will still hold student coming out parties.
[1:07:22.480 --> 1:07:26.080]  And again, it's not about hating an adult with what they do in their life.
[1:07:26.080 --> 1:07:30.720]  These people are doing things adults don't tell their children, wrecking their innocence.
[1:07:30.720 --> 1:07:36.840]  This is mind rape, which is then putting them on the on ramp to pedophilia.
[1:07:36.840 --> 1:07:38.600]  This is grooming 101.
[1:07:38.600 --> 1:07:42.520]  These are what people use to drive around in white vans and try to lure kids into cars
[1:07:42.520 --> 1:07:44.280]  with puppies and candy.
[1:07:44.280 --> 1:07:46.720]  And now they're up there saying we're luring them.
[1:07:46.720 --> 1:07:49.560]  And I see new videos every day without looking at city council.
[1:07:49.560 --> 1:07:51.160]  Yes, I'm grooming your children.
[1:07:51.160 --> 1:07:52.560]  I want to have sex with them.
[1:07:52.560 --> 1:07:59.720]  I mean, and you're like, what, where do you see this going and with Disney and DeSantis
[1:07:59.720 --> 1:08:01.080]  and just all of it?
[1:08:01.080 --> 1:08:04.440]  How bad is this going to get before it's better and then we'll go to these clips?
[1:08:04.440 --> 1:08:09.560]  Well, if we don't say anything, Alex, if we don't put a stop to it, if we don't draw a
[1:08:09.560 --> 1:08:14.160]  line in the sand, thank God for Governor Randa Santis going on offense and saying, OK, enough
[1:08:14.160 --> 1:08:15.600]  is enough here.
[1:08:15.600 --> 1:08:16.600]  Stop it.
[1:08:16.600 --> 1:08:18.000]  These people are not going to continue with this.
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:22.280]  We all have to have that same heart and whatever you can do, depending on you peacefully,
[1:08:22.280 --> 1:08:24.040]  you push back and say enough is enough.
[1:08:24.040 --> 1:08:25.320]  You don't go after our kids.
[1:08:25.320 --> 1:08:30.280]  And like you said, Alex, these are open, open groomers that take to TikTok.
[1:08:30.280 --> 1:08:31.280]  They're open about it.
[1:08:31.280 --> 1:08:32.280]  They're proud about it.
[1:08:32.280 --> 1:08:33.600]  They're just celebrating it.
[1:08:33.600 --> 1:08:34.600]  They're not ashamed of it.
[1:08:34.600 --> 1:08:37.560]  And we're not just selectively picking a few freaks.
[1:08:37.560 --> 1:08:39.680]  We're not just selectively picking a few freaks.
[1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:40.960]  There's thousands of these videos.
[1:08:40.960 --> 1:08:44.000]  I can't even keep track of them.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  Absolutely.
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  And you're seeing this happen more and more because the more that, oh, we just say that
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:52.560]  we're going to be tolerant and we're just going to, you know, let this slide.
[1:08:52.560 --> 1:08:56.600]  And it's just people that want to identify something sexually different.
[1:08:56.600 --> 1:08:59.400]  No, because now that same community is going after kids.
[1:08:59.400 --> 1:09:01.680]  And listen, I'll say the same thing here as well.
[1:09:01.680 --> 1:09:06.200]  If these were straight people, OK, if this was like an organization of Republicans that
[1:09:06.200 --> 1:09:10.280]  was doing the same thing, just to use an example, you and I, Alex, would be saying the same
[1:09:10.280 --> 1:09:13.120]  crap right now, saying, don't groom the damn kids.
[1:09:13.120 --> 1:09:16.440]  You know, that's a key point, heterosexual, homosexual grooming is wrong.
[1:09:16.440 --> 1:09:21.920]  But because they see gay as OK, so it is like we're lesbians and we're going to talk to
[1:09:21.920 --> 1:09:25.080]  your 10 year old daughter about sex with us and you're not going to stop us.
[1:09:25.080 --> 1:09:26.880]  And it's so sick.
[1:09:26.880 --> 1:09:27.880]  It's sick.
[1:09:27.880 --> 1:09:28.880]  Like you're grown women.
[1:09:28.880 --> 1:09:30.240]  You want to be lesbians?
[1:09:30.240 --> 1:09:31.240]  Go get women.
[1:09:31.240 --> 1:09:32.240]  Leave our daughters alone.
[1:09:32.240 --> 1:09:33.240]  You freaks.
[1:09:33.240 --> 1:09:34.240]  You demons.
[1:09:34.240 --> 1:09:35.240]  Absolutely.
[1:09:35.240 --> 1:09:40.760]  Nobody in their right mind, Alex, should want to have the right to have some kind of isolated
[1:09:40.760 --> 1:09:48.400]  secret conversation with a kindergartner about anal sex, penises, vaginas or anything like
[1:09:48.400 --> 1:09:53.920]  that, whether it's heterosexual, homosexual, transsexual, no, no, you're right.
[1:09:53.920 --> 1:09:58.240]  So how did the how did the how did the pedophiles and perverts under the under the floorboards
[1:09:58.240 --> 1:10:00.240]  like cockroaches breed like this?
[1:10:00.240 --> 1:10:02.160]  Like what the hell's going on here?
[1:10:02.160 --> 1:10:04.000]  Is there all over the place?
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:08.600]  Alex, you and I know that Disney has had a petto problem for a very long time.
[1:10:08.600 --> 1:10:13.000]  Hollywood is infected, is tainted with pedophilia.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:15.280]  You've been talking about this for decades.
[1:10:15.280 --> 1:10:17.840]  People are just now starting to see it come out into the open.
[1:10:17.840 --> 1:10:21.760]  And it's like I said on the last segment, Alex, the only difference now between the
[1:10:21.760 --> 1:10:26.160]  past is that they would do this stuff in darkness and we would see trials come out and people
[1:10:26.160 --> 1:10:30.040]  get exposed every now and then you would come out and talk about Epstein 10 years ago.
[1:10:30.040 --> 1:10:31.320]  Oh, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[1:10:31.320 --> 1:10:32.320]  You're crazy.
[1:10:32.320 --> 1:10:37.920]  But now people are starting to see them come out in the open and literally oppose child
[1:10:37.920 --> 1:10:38.920]  grooming laws.
[1:10:38.920 --> 1:10:40.640]  It's out in the open, Alex.
[1:10:40.640 --> 1:10:45.040]  And that's what I said on the last segment is the only difference between then is now
[1:10:45.040 --> 1:10:48.560]  is that they are openly doing it and they're proud and they're unashamed.
[1:10:48.560 --> 1:10:49.560]  It's disgusting.
[1:10:49.560 --> 1:10:50.560]  Well, that's right.
[1:10:50.560 --> 1:10:54.040]  And then we've got California other states trying to kill babies after they're born.
[1:10:54.040 --> 1:10:56.040]  This is about killing and stealing and destroying.
[1:10:56.040 --> 1:10:58.040]  Again, you sent me a whole bunch of clips.
[1:10:58.040 --> 1:11:00.640]  Here's just two of them because this is hard to watch, folks.
[1:11:00.640 --> 1:11:01.640]  We're going to watch it.
[1:11:01.640 --> 1:11:07.640]  Here's clip nine LGBTQ YouTubers say all your children belong to us.
[1:11:07.640 --> 1:11:08.640]  Here it is.
[1:11:08.640 --> 1:11:13.440]  Oh, you don't want your children taught in school about what gay is?
[1:11:13.440 --> 1:11:19.560]  Oh, that's nice because, you know, maybe they would like to watch our channel and find out.
[1:11:19.560 --> 1:11:23.120]  And do you want to know what an asexual lesbian is?
[1:11:23.120 --> 1:11:25.160]  Oh, stick around, honey.
[1:11:25.160 --> 1:11:27.000]  I got you covered.
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:29.520]  I will raise you just right.
[1:11:29.520 --> 1:11:33.040]  Your mommy and daddy let you lose on the internet alone.
[1:11:33.040 --> 1:11:35.040]  And that was their problem.
[1:11:35.040 --> 1:11:36.960]  And now you belong.
[1:11:36.960 --> 1:11:39.160]  All your children are belong to us.
[1:11:39.160 --> 1:11:44.960]  Are you sure that you want your don't say gay bill now?
[1:11:44.960 --> 1:11:48.560]  All your children belong to us.
[1:11:48.560 --> 1:11:51.280]  These are real perverts, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:11:51.280 --> 1:11:55.800]  And again, you would want your neighbor, if you don't, your neighbor five years, you've
[1:11:55.800 --> 1:12:00.040]  had barbecues and everything, and you catch the neighbor talking to your daughter about
[1:12:00.040 --> 1:12:04.560]  when she's six years old about her sex, you would beat their ass.
[1:12:04.560 --> 1:12:05.560]  You would call the police.
[1:12:05.560 --> 1:12:09.480]  And now it's creepy women saying your children belong to us.
[1:12:09.480 --> 1:12:15.080]  I mean, it's just the trespassing of this, the destruction of innocence.
[1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:16.560]  It's just mind boggling.
[1:12:16.560 --> 1:12:17.560]  Here's another clip.
[1:12:17.560 --> 1:12:20.400]  Here is a Florida teacher talking about your children.
[1:12:20.400 --> 1:12:27.560]  I just want to go ahead and state that I would rather lose my job than out one of my students
[1:12:27.560 --> 1:12:28.800]  to their families.
[1:12:28.800 --> 1:12:34.400]  Being a safe person and a safe place for kids that don't have that at home is one of the
[1:12:34.400 --> 1:12:36.840]  best parts of being a teacher.
[1:12:36.840 --> 1:12:37.840]  So yeah, I'm not doing it.
[1:12:37.840 --> 1:12:38.840]  I don't know.
[1:12:38.840 --> 1:12:39.840]  Fire me.
[1:12:39.840 --> 1:12:40.840]  Sue me.
[1:12:40.840 --> 1:12:41.840]  Take me to jail.
[1:12:41.840 --> 1:12:42.840]  I'm not doing it.
[1:12:42.840 --> 1:12:46.240]  So she's an elementary school teacher, Drew, I'm going to get to you, but I mean, she's
[1:12:46.240 --> 1:12:50.840]  an elementary school student, a teacher, and she's saying outing them.
[1:12:50.840 --> 1:12:52.400]  No, you're not outing them.
[1:12:52.400 --> 1:12:58.000]  You're brainwashing them and saying you can't stop because you're a freak.
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:12:59.160]  You're a scumbag.
[1:12:59.160 --> 1:13:02.280]  You are connected to the sexualization of children.
[1:13:02.280 --> 1:13:07.200]  You're a bad person because you're a disgusting blob that no woman or no man wants and you
[1:13:07.200 --> 1:13:11.160]  can only mess with little kids because they're not even supposed to be sexually active and
[1:13:11.160 --> 1:13:12.720]  destroy their future.
[1:13:12.720 --> 1:13:13.720]  You monster.
[1:13:13.720 --> 1:13:14.720]  Sorry.
[1:13:14.720 --> 1:13:15.720]  Go ahead.
[1:13:15.720 --> 1:13:16.720]  Well, they're disgusting their pedophiles.
[1:13:16.720 --> 1:13:17.720]  She says, oh, I don't care.
[1:13:17.720 --> 1:13:18.720]  Put me in jail.
[1:13:18.720 --> 1:13:19.720]  Yeah, throw her in jail.
[1:13:19.720 --> 1:13:20.720]  Throw the key away.
[1:13:20.720 --> 1:13:22.120]  Put her in prison.
[1:13:22.120 --> 1:13:23.800]  That's the attitude we need right now.
[1:13:23.800 --> 1:13:26.400]  Put her in a rocket and shoot her ass out in space.
[1:13:26.400 --> 1:13:27.400]  Yes.
[1:13:27.400 --> 1:13:30.960]  If these people want to break the law, then we need to uphold the law and throw them
[1:13:30.960 --> 1:13:33.680]  in prison for targeting children.
[1:13:33.680 --> 1:13:36.920]  That's the attitude we need right now peacefully and lawfully.
[1:13:36.920 --> 1:13:40.360]  And I'll say this to Alex, shame on the LGBTQ community.
[1:13:40.360 --> 1:13:42.760]  Now, hear me out here, okay?
[1:13:42.760 --> 1:13:48.800]  What if you do have some kindergarten, third grader, I don't know, fifth grade kid that
[1:13:48.800 --> 1:13:52.480]  comes out and says, you know what, I think I'm gay, whatever.
[1:13:52.480 --> 1:13:53.480]  I think I'm gay.
[1:13:53.480 --> 1:13:56.720]  Well, they say that because all they're being told is say that it's like they're given a
[1:13:56.720 --> 1:13:57.720]  choice.
[1:13:57.720 --> 1:13:59.160]  You want to be Superman or Batman?
[1:13:59.160 --> 1:14:00.160]  Gay straight.
[1:14:00.160 --> 1:14:01.160]  You want to be Batman.
[1:14:01.160 --> 1:14:02.160]  Oh, you're gay.
[1:14:02.160 --> 1:14:03.160]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[1:14:03.160 --> 1:14:04.760]  But check this out, Alex.
[1:14:04.760 --> 1:14:10.600]  Why would the LGBTQ community not want the parents to have such a sacred conversation
[1:14:10.600 --> 1:14:15.640]  with their child when it comes to something as personal like that?
[1:14:15.640 --> 1:14:16.640]  No, no, no, no, no.
[1:14:16.640 --> 1:14:21.600]  The LGBT community comes as, no, if there's some little kid that comes out as gay or whatever,
[1:14:21.600 --> 1:14:26.000]  let them have a conversation with some kind of pedophile in the public education system.
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:27.640]  Don't let them tell the parents about it.
[1:14:27.640 --> 1:14:31.680]  Who do you think is going to take advantage of a little kid that might be coming out as
[1:14:31.680 --> 1:14:32.680]  gay?
[1:14:32.680 --> 1:14:33.680]  Who is going to take advantage?
[1:14:33.680 --> 1:14:34.680]  No, you're totally right.
[1:14:34.680 --> 1:14:36.200]  This is grooming.
[1:14:36.200 --> 1:14:37.480]  This is a pedophile army.
[1:14:37.480 --> 1:14:41.440]  Drew Hernandez in a minute, closing comments and how people find your great reports.
[1:14:41.440 --> 1:14:42.440]  Absolutely.
[1:14:42.440 --> 1:14:44.960]  Everybody can follow me on Twitter, DrewHLive.
[1:14:44.960 --> 1:14:46.480]  You can watch my show every day.
[1:14:46.480 --> 1:14:49.360]  Just go on YouTube, find it, Frontlines with Drew Hernandez.
[1:14:49.360 --> 1:14:51.760]  And I need to say this before I leave.
[1:14:51.760 --> 1:14:56.600]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones, needs to support Infowars and
[1:14:56.600 --> 1:14:58.120]  Band.Video.
[1:14:58.120 --> 1:15:01.880]  I know Alex doesn't like to talk about this a lot on air, but you know, the Bible says,
[1:15:01.880 --> 1:15:03.200]  let another mouth praise you.
[1:15:03.200 --> 1:15:04.960]  I'm going to do that right now.
[1:15:04.960 --> 1:15:09.000]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:14.360]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez,
[1:15:14.360 --> 1:15:19.600]  how many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones,
[1:15:19.600 --> 1:15:20.600]  including myself.
[1:15:20.600 --> 1:15:25.160]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform.
[1:15:25.160 --> 1:15:28.160]  And I would probably not even be half of where I am right now.
[1:15:28.160 --> 1:15:32.400]  If it weren't for Alex Jones, even being my friend or talking to me, I mean, I've been
[1:15:32.400 --> 1:15:37.680]  able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim cast the super Tim cast IRL.
[1:15:37.680 --> 1:15:43.560]  Listen, what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones and Band.Video for granted because you

[1:20:27.100 --> 1:20:30.500]  InfoWars.
[1:20:30.500 --> 1:20:34.220]  A guy that's been so busy, I haven't been able to get him on in months, it's Robert
[1:20:34.220 --> 1:20:35.220]  Barns.
[1:20:35.220 --> 1:20:36.220]  He's like, where's Robert Barns?
[1:20:36.220 --> 1:20:42.060]  Robert Barns is busy, but he joins us now, man, he's been kicking ass on exposing Ukraine
[1:20:42.060 --> 1:20:47.140]  and the economy and the inflation, and what's going to happen with Biden, so I usually ask
[1:20:47.140 --> 1:20:50.380]  the questions, but I'm just going to tell Barns, you got a laundry list, brother, and
[1:20:50.380 --> 1:20:52.300]  we've got a lot of folks tuned in tonight.
[1:20:52.300 --> 1:20:57.060]  I want you to just have the floor, but first off, you've been involved for years as a consultant,
[1:20:57.060 --> 1:20:58.620]  and watching this and seeing this.
[1:20:58.620 --> 1:20:59.620]  Am I exaggerating?
[1:20:59.620 --> 1:21:04.020]  Because you've seen our financials, you helped us produce them.
[1:21:04.020 --> 1:21:07.700]  What is your view on them claiming, I'm going to the feds, to rat everybody out, that's
[1:21:07.700 --> 1:21:14.620]  not true, that I've got $60 million, $80 million, that, what do you make of all this, and these
[1:21:14.620 --> 1:21:20.340]  double defaults that they've not even announced where they're saying, I can't talk, my lawyers
[1:21:20.340 --> 1:21:25.740]  are literally going to wear duct tape over their faces, what do you make of just this
[1:21:25.740 --> 1:21:29.020]  unprecedented move, and what does this signify to you, my friend?
[1:21:29.020 --> 1:21:30.020]  Sure.
[1:21:30.020 --> 1:21:33.820]  I mean, it's a law fair at a different scale, it's a law fair at a different level, because
[1:21:33.820 --> 1:21:38.660]  what you have are people that, some of whom suffered a tragedy, who are placing blame
[1:21:38.660 --> 1:21:43.780]  for that tragedy on someone in something that had nothing to do with the tragedy, and instead
[1:21:43.780 --> 1:21:48.380]  of blaming the school system that failed to provide adequate safety measurements, instead
[1:21:48.380 --> 1:21:55.060]  of blaming the psychological industry that has basically, Big Pharma has just flooded
[1:21:55.060 --> 1:22:01.020]  young disturbed kids with medications that can and often does make them worse off, rather
[1:22:01.020 --> 1:22:05.860]  than deal with any of those broader cultural phenomena, or a Hollywood that celebrates
[1:22:05.860 --> 1:22:11.380]  and glorifies certain kinds of violence targeting young vulnerable minds, instead, they are
[1:22:11.380 --> 1:22:17.340]  blaming the independent news broadcast that has produced and published more independent
[1:22:17.340 --> 1:22:22.900]  information to challenge and contest institutional narratives, and help predict and preview what
[1:22:22.900 --> 1:22:26.300]  happened with the lockdowns, what happened with the stolen election, what happened with
[1:22:26.300 --> 1:22:32.780]  bogus wars, Info Wars has been the tip of the spear at warning about the World Health
[1:22:32.780 --> 1:22:37.500]  Organization, at warning about Bill Gates, at warning about George Soros, at warning
[1:22:37.500 --> 1:22:42.500]  about the globalist agenda, to strip ordinary people of their sovereignty over their economy,
[1:22:42.500 --> 1:22:47.340]  over their own personal health, over their own well-being, over their own education,
[1:22:47.340 --> 1:22:51.460]  to the degree they want to send in groomers to our kindergarten and at Disney World.
[1:22:51.460 --> 1:22:55.420]  So this is the way they have targeted someone that has nothing to do with what they are
[1:22:55.420 --> 1:23:01.260]  describing, and the legal process could not afford ever a trial on the merits.
[1:23:01.260 --> 1:23:06.540]  A trial on the merits, even a liberal Austin jury, even a liberal Connecticut jury would
[1:23:06.540 --> 1:23:11.460]  conclude based on the evidence that you are not guilty and Info Wars is not guilty of
[1:23:11.460 --> 1:23:14.460]  what they've been accused of, and they couldn't afford that.
[1:23:14.460 --> 1:23:20.100]  And so they came up with a fictional fabricated mythical version of the facts, the media propagated
[1:23:20.100 --> 1:23:27.340]  this fake news story all the way through that was never true, that could not be consistent
[1:23:27.340 --> 1:23:30.740]  with or be corroborated by actual evidence.
[1:23:30.740 --> 1:23:35.980]  And so for those purposes, they had to pretend that you hid the evidence that never existed.
[1:23:35.980 --> 1:23:39.580]  So rather than admit the evidence disproved their claims, they pretended there was some
[1:23:39.580 --> 1:23:42.580]  secret evidence out there that had magically disappeared.
[1:23:42.580 --> 1:23:48.900]  And even though Info Wars produced more documents, more invasive information, more private information,
[1:23:48.900 --> 1:23:55.900]  more emails, more messages, even including everything that went into the spam box, then
[1:23:55.900 --> 1:24:01.700]  anybody has ever had to produce in the history of any slap cases, in the history of any slap
[1:24:01.700 --> 1:24:07.540]  motions, they denied Info Wars and every defendant, not just Alex Jones, but Info Wars, every
[1:24:07.540 --> 1:24:14.180]  Info Wars entity that they sued, Owen Schreuer, they denied everybody the means to even file
[1:24:14.180 --> 1:24:17.740]  a motion to dismiss, but they weren't satisfied with that.
[1:24:17.740 --> 1:24:23.260]  Even after all of this invasive, unprecedented, unparalleled discovery, getting information
[1:24:23.260 --> 1:24:27.540]  that most courts would never have allowed them to turn over, never would have required
[1:24:27.540 --> 1:24:31.620]  to be turned over, the New York Times sure hasn't had to turn it over in its lawsuits
[1:24:31.620 --> 1:24:37.820]  involving Project Veritas, the courts rushed in to protect the New York Times, whereas
[1:24:37.820 --> 1:24:41.340]  they've rushed in to punish Alex Jones at Info Wars.
[1:24:41.340 --> 1:24:46.260]  After producing over a million pieces of information, most of which never should have had to be
[1:24:46.260 --> 1:24:52.620]  disclosed and disclosed, after hours and hours and days and days of deposition, the average
[1:24:52.620 --> 1:24:58.180]  case you only get one seven-hour deposition, you don't get days and days and days of depositions
[1:24:58.180 --> 1:25:02.460]  of the same party, after then denying the right to bring a motion to dismiss, denying
[1:25:02.460 --> 1:25:06.780]  the right to bring a First Amendment anti-slap motion, then said, you know what, you can't
[1:25:06.780 --> 1:25:11.860]  even present any evidence at trial as to your innocence, you are effectively gagged
[1:25:11.860 --> 1:25:16.660]  like Bobby Seale in the Chicago 7 trial, you are basically prohibited and limited from
[1:25:16.660 --> 1:25:23.100]  being able to present any of the exculpatory evidence that proves and documents and demonstrates
[1:25:23.100 --> 1:25:28.300]  not only your factual innocence but your legal innocence under the First Amendment to the
[1:25:28.300 --> 1:25:32.300]  United States Constitution, the right of the freedom of press, the right of the freedom
[1:25:32.300 --> 1:25:33.300]  of speech.
[1:25:33.300 --> 1:25:39.660]  And Barnes, you know, it says in here, and the judge signed off, we cannot mention the
[1:25:39.660 --> 1:25:42.140]  First Amendment.
[1:25:42.140 --> 1:25:46.500]  Precisely, because the First Amendment is a complete defense in this case, and that's
[1:25:46.500 --> 1:25:50.820]  why they don't want the jury to know about, and even a liberal jury pool in Austin, even
[1:25:50.820 --> 1:25:56.060]  a liberal jury pool in Connecticut would recognize these facts, would recognize this is a classic
[1:25:56.060 --> 1:25:57.060]  First Amendment.
[1:25:57.060 --> 1:25:58.340]  Let me ask you this, why are they so desperate?
[1:25:58.340 --> 1:25:59.780]  Why are they so crazy?
[1:25:59.780 --> 1:26:06.540]  I mean, well, if you were about to launch one of the biggest stolen elections in American
[1:26:06.540 --> 1:26:11.940]  history, if you were about to launch one of the most destabilizing wars since World War
[1:26:11.940 --> 1:26:17.580]  II, if you were about to launch one of the most bogus pandemics to induce massive lockdowns
[1:26:17.580 --> 1:26:24.740]  and control over people's populations in history, then you cannot have a unimpeached independent
[1:26:24.740 --> 1:26:29.020]  media network that is the biggest and most powerful independent media network in the
[1:26:29.020 --> 1:26:35.260]  world being able to reach everyone they wanted to reach, being able to have people hear them
[1:26:35.260 --> 1:26:41.820]  and get the accurate information, and being able to present that information without a
[1:26:41.820 --> 1:26:44.020]  cloud of scandal surrounding it.
[1:26:44.020 --> 1:26:47.700]  So the goal is to tell people, you better not listen to Alex Jones, you better not listen
[1:26:47.700 --> 1:26:48.700]  to Info Wars.
[1:26:48.700 --> 1:26:52.700]  Don't worry, that pandemic is a real pandemic, we really need that lockdown.
[1:26:52.700 --> 1:26:56.300]  Don't worry, the Russians are really bad, we really need to think about nuclear war
[1:26:56.300 --> 1:26:57.800]  against Russia.
[1:26:57.800 --> 1:27:02.540]  Don't worry, there was no election stolen, it was just fortified as Newsweek and Time
[1:27:02.540 --> 1:27:03.860]  put it.
[1:27:03.860 --> 1:27:07.620]  They need it, and don't listen to whatever you're doing to Alex Jones and Info Wars
[1:27:07.620 --> 1:27:13.260]  because they have something to do with some crazy guy doing something terrible 10 years
[1:27:13.260 --> 1:27:14.860]  ago in Connecticut.
[1:27:14.860 --> 1:27:19.780]  That's why they had to do, it was a mass smear campaign, it was law fair to try to force you
[1:27:19.780 --> 1:27:24.740]  into bankruptcy, but also law fair for the purposes of smearing your association and
[1:27:24.740 --> 1:27:29.740]  affiliation so that ordinary people who might hear your voice don't listen to the message,
[1:27:29.740 --> 1:27:32.860]  so they don't know what's really happening with the pandemic, don't know what's really
[1:27:32.860 --> 1:27:36.740]  happening with the election, don't know what's really happening with global war.
[1:27:36.740 --> 1:27:43.060]  Wow, you're always on fire, but you are 100% dead on, so looking at this and then moving
[1:27:43.060 --> 1:27:47.300]  away from how they're attacking Info Wars, they're attacking the American people, Biden
[1:27:47.300 --> 1:27:52.540]  shutting off the pipelines, opening the borders, getting rid of medical checks at the border,
[1:27:52.540 --> 1:27:56.620]  saying if a man shows up with two kids, don't even check their ID, just let them in.
[1:27:56.620 --> 1:28:03.900]  I mean, the criminal level of action and then CNN spends 300 million on CNN Plus totally
[1:28:03.900 --> 1:28:11.300]  fails, Netflix, Disney in trouble, the whole global system is collapsing, clearly they're
[1:28:11.300 --> 1:28:14.980]  trying to take us with them.
[1:28:14.980 --> 1:28:20.900]  Where do you see this going, Robert Barnes, because it's just madness, it's just like
[1:28:20.900 --> 1:28:26.580]  why did Hitler attack England and North Africa and Poland and the Russians, I mean, it just
[1:28:26.580 --> 1:28:27.580]  like, why?
[1:28:27.580 --> 1:28:32.380]  Why did you just build highways and cars and turn your, I mean, it takes the same thing,
[1:28:32.380 --> 1:28:37.460]  like why are they attacking everybody and our speech and censoring, clearly they're
[1:28:37.460 --> 1:28:41.420]  not going to win in the end, but the question is, what's going to be left after they've
[1:28:41.420 --> 1:28:42.420]  done this?
[1:28:42.420 --> 1:28:45.940]  Well, I think it's two different factors going on.
[1:28:45.940 --> 1:28:49.500]  Globalists love control more than anything else, so everything's about control, control,
[1:28:49.500 --> 1:28:50.500]  control.
[1:28:50.500 --> 1:28:56.020]  It's this sort of managerial class's obsession with engineering the world, socially engineering,
[1:28:56.020 --> 1:28:58.020]  economics.
[1:28:58.020 --> 1:29:00.580]  Let's go.
[1:29:00.580 --> 1:29:08.800]  What are champions made of?
[1:29:08.800 --> 1:29:18.780]  Here's a man who can show you.
[1:29:48.780 --> 1:29:58.780]  Thirty-one, three, nine, is the InfoWarsLive.com.
[1:29:58.780 --> 1:30:03.300]  Introducing the newest product from InfoWarsLive.com.
[1:30:03.300 --> 1:30:06.820]  We are so proud of InfoWarsLive immune support.

[1:30:13.020 --> 1:30:14.020]  defenses.

[1:30:31.460 --> 1:30:34.020]  loatium root, and more.
[1:30:34.020 --> 1:30:35.940]  This product is incredible.
[1:30:35.940 --> 1:30:41.300]  InfoWars immune support, exclusively available at InfoWarsLive.com, is funding the tip of
[1:30:41.300 --> 1:30:43.620]  the spear, the InfoWars operation.
[1:30:43.620 --> 1:30:45.020]  It is a 360 win.
[1:30:45.020 --> 1:30:49.460]  The only way you fail is by not taking action and getting this product to boost your body's
[1:30:49.460 --> 1:30:52.100]  natural defenses and keep InfoWars on the air.
[1:30:52.100 --> 1:30:54.540]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action.
[1:30:54.540 --> 1:30:55.540]  Take action now.
[1:30:55.540 --> 1:30:56.540]  InfoWarsLive.com.
[1:30:56.540 --> 1:31:01.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[1:31:01.020 --> 1:31:04.460]  I need your help keeping InfoWars on the air and strong.
[1:31:04.460 --> 1:31:08.460]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[1:31:08.460 --> 1:31:09.620]  I was born for this.
[1:31:09.620 --> 1:31:10.620]  You were born for this.
[1:31:10.620 --> 1:31:15.460]  And people are really waking up right now, but we had to build our own infrastructure
[1:31:15.460 --> 1:31:19.820]  because of the censorship and de-platforming that cost tens of millions of dollars.
[1:31:19.820 --> 1:31:24.500]  And now, with Band-Aught Video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform
[1:31:24.500 --> 1:31:30.340]  for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free
[1:31:30.340 --> 1:31:31.340]  of charge.
[1:31:31.340 --> 1:31:36.180]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch-22.
[1:31:36.180 --> 1:31:40.660]  InfoWars and Band-Aught Video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty
[1:31:40.660 --> 1:31:41.660]  movement worldwide.
[1:31:41.660 --> 1:31:47.340]  But the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds
[1:31:47.340 --> 1:31:48.780]  of thousands of dollars a month.
[1:31:48.780 --> 1:31:53.060]  So the biggest sale in InfoWars history is going right now, the mega-emergency blowout
[1:31:53.060 --> 1:31:59.180]  sale up to 75% off, getting incredible products and keeping InfoWars as strong as ever.
[1:31:59.180 --> 1:32:06.380]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWarsStore.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20-year
[1:32:06.380 --> 1:32:07.380]  history.
[1:32:07.380 --> 1:32:12.980]  And that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding, the supply chains
[1:32:12.980 --> 1:32:18.900]  have broken down, and InfoWars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying for
[1:32:18.900 --> 1:32:19.900]  operations.
[1:32:19.900 --> 1:32:24.100]  And I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalists making their main
[1:32:24.100 --> 1:32:25.100]  move.
[1:32:25.100 --> 1:32:27.940]  InfoWars, its paradoxical, is more popular than ever.
[1:32:27.940 --> 1:32:31.140]  It is reaching more people than ever despite the censorship.
[1:32:31.140 --> 1:32:34.620]  But because of cost-increasing and having to run our own infrastructure and pay for
[1:32:34.620 --> 1:32:38.500]  our own bandwidth and everything else, we are running out of money.
[1:32:38.500 --> 1:32:45.140]  So listen, up to 75% off at InfoWarsStore.com on things like amazing Patriot t-shirts that
[1:32:45.140 --> 1:32:47.820]  help spread the word and fund the operation.
[1:32:47.820 --> 1:32:53.580]  On supplements, on books, on films, everything is 25-75% off right now.
[1:32:53.580 --> 1:32:56.940]  The biggest sale in our history at InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:32:56.940 --> 1:33:00.540]  Thank you for your support.
[1:33:00.540 --> 1:33:10.420]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:10.420 --> 1:33:32.820]  Why are they attacking everybody and our speech and censoring?
[1:33:32.820 --> 1:33:37.420]  Clearly they're not going to win in the end, but the question is, what's going to be left
[1:33:37.420 --> 1:33:38.420]  if they've done this?
[1:33:38.420 --> 1:33:42.300]  Well, I think it's two different factors going on.
[1:33:42.300 --> 1:33:45.620]  Globalists love control more than anything else, so everything's about control, control,
[1:33:45.620 --> 1:33:46.620]  control.
[1:33:46.620 --> 1:33:52.220]  It's this sort of managerial class's obsession with engineering the world, socially engineering,
[1:33:52.220 --> 1:33:55.540]  culturally engineering, economically engineering the world.
[1:33:55.540 --> 1:33:59.260]  And they're so driven by that psychopathology they can't help themselves.
[1:33:59.260 --> 1:34:01.540]  The second part of it is they're increasingly removed.
[1:34:01.540 --> 1:34:07.100]  I describe it as they're very much like the communists of the late 1970s, early 1980s,
[1:34:07.100 --> 1:34:11.380]  who don't realize their system is collapsing all around them, don't realize the Russian
[1:34:11.380 --> 1:34:14.740]  knight is dying inside of its own armor to quote Russia House.
[1:34:14.740 --> 1:34:21.180]  So because that obliviousness is an inherent flaw in the managerial class, they always
[1:34:21.180 --> 1:34:24.940]  seek to control and monopolize so much of the means of narrative distribution.
[1:34:24.940 --> 1:34:27.580]  Because that's what the war on InfoWars is about.
[1:34:27.580 --> 1:34:31.420]  Control the narrative, control the story, don't allow honest storytellers to reach the
[1:34:31.420 --> 1:34:35.460]  ordinary person, don't allow that person to understand and appreciate the information
[1:34:35.460 --> 1:34:39.180]  they're being given, that is the reason why InfoWars exist as its audience.
[1:34:39.180 --> 1:34:41.340]  It's not Alex Jones, the individual.
[1:34:41.340 --> 1:34:45.820]  It's the audience that fuels it, the audience that not only makes it able to function to
[1:34:45.820 --> 1:34:46.820]  be able to-
[1:34:46.820 --> 1:34:48.580]  Exactly, it's that populist meeting place, they fear.
[1:34:48.580 --> 1:34:49.580]  Absolutely.
[1:34:49.580 --> 1:34:53.260]  And they've got to prevent that populist meeting place at all costs.
[1:34:53.260 --> 1:34:54.780]  And they don't realize they're losing.
[1:34:54.780 --> 1:34:58.380]  They don't realize, I mean, they really thought they were going to take out Putin and Russia.
[1:34:58.380 --> 1:35:00.900]  They didn't realize, you know, Putin believes resources are power.
[1:35:00.900 --> 1:35:02.420]  He's culturally conservative.
[1:35:02.420 --> 1:35:03.780]  He's religiously conservative.
[1:35:03.780 --> 1:35:05.620]  He's the Trump of Russia.
[1:35:05.620 --> 1:35:09.780]  You can disagree with Putin, but the person who hates Putin the most is George Soros.
[1:35:09.780 --> 1:35:15.860]  Well, Putin says culture, you know, energy and food, which is exactly.
[1:35:15.860 --> 1:35:16.860]  Correct.
[1:35:16.860 --> 1:35:20.460]  And what he's done is he's- the globalist thought, if we control the international monetary
[1:35:20.460 --> 1:35:25.380]  system at the top, we control the financial system, we can use economic sanction to discipline
[1:35:25.380 --> 1:35:28.340]  anybody so that they always obey us.
[1:35:28.340 --> 1:35:31.580]  And they're shocked that it hasn't worked against Russia, the Russian people.
[1:35:31.580 --> 1:35:34.620]  They're people shocked that way- Yeah, what are they going to do, the rubles above the
[1:35:34.620 --> 1:35:40.660]  dollar for the first time in history, everybody's leaving, I mean, and people think, well, the
[1:35:40.660 --> 1:35:41.660]  globalist is doing it on purpose.
[1:35:41.660 --> 1:35:42.660]  I don't think they are.
[1:35:42.660 --> 1:35:44.340]  They just can't stop him.
[1:35:44.340 --> 1:35:45.340]  Correct.
[1:35:45.340 --> 1:35:46.500]  And they never imagine this.
[1:35:46.500 --> 1:35:50.540]  What happens when you create safe space cultures where you don't listen, where you're so obsessed
[1:35:50.540 --> 1:35:54.740]  with suppressing people from hearing Alex Jones that you yourself don't hear Alex Jones.
[1:35:54.740 --> 1:35:58.460]  The consequence is you live in such a small, bubbled world that you don't know the real
[1:35:58.460 --> 1:35:59.460]  world.
[1:35:59.460 --> 1:36:01.180]  These are like the people that were shocked the night Trump won.
[1:36:01.180 --> 1:36:03.980]  I mean, they can't believe that Putin is being successful.
[1:36:03.980 --> 1:36:07.900]  That's why they tell themselves fancy lies like Snake Island and the ghost of Kiev.
[1:36:07.900 --> 1:36:12.020]  And, you know, we have a coked up, you know, wag the dog president there in Ukraine, and
[1:36:12.020 --> 1:36:14.620]  we're pretending he's some George Washington.
[1:36:14.620 --> 1:36:17.220]  He's the next, we went to Churchill.
[1:36:17.220 --> 1:36:18.220]  This is delusional.
[1:36:18.220 --> 1:36:22.180]  And it's so delusional, Ukrainian soldiers, when they get caught or shocked because they
[1:36:22.180 --> 1:36:25.380]  didn't realize they've been losing in that part of the Donbass.
[1:36:25.380 --> 1:36:27.500]  So this is happening across the globe.
[1:36:27.500 --> 1:36:28.580]  They don't realize they're...
[1:36:28.580 --> 1:36:32.820]  We have Barack Obama making a speech about, hey, look, we experimented on a billion plus
[1:36:32.820 --> 1:36:35.100]  people with this vaccine and it turned out great.
[1:36:35.100 --> 1:36:38.980]  Well, ask all the athletes that are dropping dead right on the field.
[1:36:38.980 --> 1:36:41.220]  The ordinary person knows more and more people.
[1:36:41.220 --> 1:36:45.640]  The ordinary person knows somebody within six degrees of separation of them that has
[1:36:45.640 --> 1:36:49.660]  experienced an adverse event in response to this vaccine.
[1:36:49.660 --> 1:36:54.220]  And yet Obama is so clueless about it, he thinks it's something to campaign on is this
[1:36:54.220 --> 1:36:59.740]  vaccine whose unpopularity just intensifies and deepens and broadens around the globe.
[1:36:59.740 --> 1:37:00.740]  These are people that...
[1:37:00.740 --> 1:37:04.980]  The scariest thing about them is their incompetence because they could stumble us and bumble us
[1:37:04.980 --> 1:37:07.540]  like Peter Sellers is almost being...
[1:37:07.540 --> 1:37:08.540]  You're right.
[1:37:08.540 --> 1:37:14.220]  I'm horrified by these geriatrics and these crazy globalists that have all these behavioral
[1:37:14.220 --> 1:37:18.020]  psychologists but like a hundred different groups and they're not even coordinating
[1:37:18.020 --> 1:37:22.220]  and they're just blasting everything with this info and lies and then they're burning
[1:37:22.220 --> 1:37:27.100]  down but we're burning down with it and I'm like, stop, stop.
[1:37:27.100 --> 1:37:29.420]  What do you predict is going to happen?
[1:37:29.420 --> 1:37:34.140]  The good news is because of audiences like Info Wars audience keeping Info Wars afloat
[1:37:34.140 --> 1:37:35.860]  and alive, which wasn't supposed to happen.
[1:37:35.860 --> 1:37:40.300]  Info Wars was supposed to be gone, Alex Jones was supposed to be gone, all of this was supposed
[1:37:40.300 --> 1:37:45.140]  to be gone because it failed because they weren't able to break up the power of the
[1:37:45.140 --> 1:37:49.660]  people that are the true fuel of it in the same way that oil and commodities and rare
[1:37:49.660 --> 1:37:54.340]  earth minerals and wheat are the real fuel of Russia's economy that could not be broken
[1:37:54.340 --> 1:37:58.660]  by the globalists, the minds and the spirit and the soul of ordinary everyday people that
[1:37:58.660 --> 1:38:03.340]  fuel the engine of Info Wars could not be shut down in silence and consequently, more
[1:38:03.340 --> 1:38:08.740]  people know today about these fake wars, more people know today about these bad lockdowns,
[1:38:08.740 --> 1:38:14.460]  more people know today that 2020 was stolen that ever would have or could have otherwise.
[1:38:14.460 --> 1:38:19.380]  They cannot keep it contained, they cannot destroy the backbone of the American Republic
[1:38:19.380 --> 1:38:20.380]  which is before any person.
[1:38:20.380 --> 1:38:24.980]  I totally agree and Netflix imploding and CNN imploding, how did CNN think no one wants
[1:38:24.980 --> 1:38:25.980]  to watch them?
[1:38:25.980 --> 1:38:29.620]  Their average show is 80,000 viewers, we probably got millions watching right now.
[1:38:29.620 --> 1:38:36.500]  How did they think that people would then pay for it and arrogantly CNN make fun of Netflix's
[1:38:36.500 --> 1:38:40.780]  problems this week while they're imploding 100 times worse?
[1:38:40.780 --> 1:38:45.300]  I mean, Netflix still has hundreds of millions of viewers, Netflix still has all these productions.
[1:38:45.300 --> 1:38:50.660]  I mean, there are a total 20 levels above CNN and it's a total joke, yes, they're falling
[1:38:50.660 --> 1:38:56.260]  apart, yeah, people are tired of the wokeism but Netflix is still in the game.
[1:38:56.260 --> 1:38:59.740]  CNN makes fun of them while they're imploding.
[1:38:59.740 --> 1:39:05.300]  The destruction of CNN at their own hand is emblematic of the delusion of these people
[1:39:05.300 --> 1:39:09.780]  and I agree with you, it's horrifying that they aren't self aware.
[1:39:09.780 --> 1:39:14.340]  Completely, because I mean, the risk is that they stumble us into a nuclear conflict, the
[1:39:14.340 --> 1:39:19.380]  risk is that they stumble us into some true economic disaster, that the risk is that they
[1:39:19.380 --> 1:39:23.260]  get enough people to take a vaccine and it leads to massive health problems around the
[1:39:23.260 --> 1:39:24.260]  globe.
[1:39:24.260 --> 1:39:26.260]  That's the risk of these people's incompetence.
[1:39:26.260 --> 1:39:31.500]  They're like the communists who, you know, Mao, his great leap forwards kept leading
[1:39:31.500 --> 1:39:32.900]  to mass starvation.
[1:39:32.900 --> 1:39:37.100]  The same thing happened in Russia, not once but twice after the 1920s, again in the 1930s,
[1:39:37.100 --> 1:39:39.260]  mass famines across the Soviet Union.
[1:39:39.260 --> 1:39:40.700]  So that's the risk.
[1:39:40.700 --> 1:39:45.260]  These people are so incompetent and inept that they will stumble us into some public
[1:39:45.260 --> 1:39:47.780]  health disaster or some world war.
[1:39:47.780 --> 1:39:52.140]  But the good news is they're losing on the, they're losing the info war, they're losing
[1:39:52.140 --> 1:39:56.940]  the economic war, they're losing the political war and ultimately they're going to lose completely.
[1:39:56.940 --> 1:40:01.980]  It's just a matter of time and the more desperate they are, the more desperate they sound, that
[1:40:01.980 --> 1:40:07.260]  is the siren song of ultimate victory for people who love freedom and liberty in the
[1:40:07.260 --> 1:40:08.260]  world.
[1:40:08.260 --> 1:40:11.740]  I totally agree, man, it's always, you got to come back on, you got to come on more,
[1:40:11.740 --> 1:40:12.900]  Robert, you're amazing.
[1:40:12.900 --> 1:40:14.420]  Let's expand on this.
[1:40:14.420 --> 1:40:18.620]  This is a selfish question, but I really want to pick your brain.
[1:40:18.620 --> 1:40:24.740]  New York Times articles, others say, Jones is reaching out to the feds and wants to tell
[1:40:24.740 --> 1:40:25.740]  what happened.
[1:40:25.740 --> 1:40:27.100]  He's going to turn states evidence.
[1:40:27.100 --> 1:40:28.580]  Well, ain't nothing happened.
[1:40:28.580 --> 1:40:29.980]  I wasn't involved in anything.
[1:40:29.980 --> 1:40:30.980]  I don't think I can tell them.
[1:40:30.980 --> 1:40:31.980]  Plus I didn't do that.
[1:40:31.980 --> 1:40:36.300]  They keep wanting to meet with us and I said, okay, give me immunity and a list of questions
[1:40:36.300 --> 1:40:41.900]  and drop your fake charges on Owen shroyer, who they say attacked the capital and doesn't
[1:40:41.900 --> 1:40:44.660]  work at info wars in his indictment.
[1:40:44.660 --> 1:40:48.780]  And then it's in the New York Times front page, Jones is going to rat out what they
[1:40:48.780 --> 1:40:49.780]  really did.
[1:40:49.780 --> 1:40:55.660]  I mean, that is so sophomoric and you add that on the back of Whitmer and all that coming
[1:40:55.660 --> 1:41:00.060]  out that it was provocateur and they're not guilty and the and the and the mist trial.
[1:41:00.060 --> 1:41:03.660]  I mean, it's just bizarre that they're going forward.
[1:41:03.660 --> 1:41:09.660]  So why do you think literally folks, if you do Alex Jones, Google news over a thousand
[1:41:09.660 --> 1:41:15.460]  articles saying, I am going to come out and expose Trump for January 6th, just preposterous.
[1:41:15.460 --> 1:41:16.460]  I didn't talk to Trump.
[1:41:16.460 --> 1:41:17.860]  There's nothing to say.
[1:41:17.860 --> 1:41:18.860]  They know that.
[1:41:18.860 --> 1:41:26.100]  So what, what do you see that as I think it's their belief that they can continue to spin
[1:41:26.100 --> 1:41:30.340]  this fake narrative about January 6th because they have a fixed judiciary that's mostly
[1:41:30.340 --> 1:41:36.220]  corrupt, that's not able to be impartial in DC, that the only case is worse than January
[1:41:36.220 --> 1:41:40.740]  6 in terms of judicial bias and prejudice have been the info wars cases.
[1:41:40.740 --> 1:41:44.580]  I would cite them if I was teaching a law school class, this is what judicial bias looks
[1:41:44.580 --> 1:41:45.580]  like.
[1:41:45.580 --> 1:41:48.540]  This is what the incapacity to be independent looks like.
[1:41:48.540 --> 1:41:52.660]  This is these cases are not really embarrassing the info wars as much as they are embarrassing
[1:41:52.660 --> 1:41:55.060]  to the lack of independence in our judiciary.
[1:41:55.060 --> 1:41:56.140]  And they speak volumes to it.
[1:41:56.140 --> 1:41:57.940]  And that's true of the January 6 cases.
[1:41:57.940 --> 1:42:01.580]  I mean, you have judges who have admitted the legal charges against many of the January
[1:42:01.580 --> 1:42:05.140]  6 cases do not even meet legal self sufficiency.
[1:42:05.140 --> 1:42:09.100]  The very basic elements, they have to be dismissed at the motion to dismiss stage.
[1:42:09.100 --> 1:42:13.100]  And yet other judges are letting people get convicted of this fake crime.
[1:42:13.100 --> 1:42:17.300]  And as, as we discussed in the lead up to this, the great concern was the government
[1:42:17.300 --> 1:42:19.340]  being up to some sort of shenanigan.
[1:42:19.340 --> 1:42:24.100]  The reality is your presence there led to fewer people going in, not more people going
[1:42:24.100 --> 1:42:25.100]  in.
[1:42:25.100 --> 1:42:29.980]  We had known what QAnon was up to, if we had known that Pelosi and the DC mayor were standing
[1:42:29.980 --> 1:42:35.340]  down the National Guard, we're taking Capitol Police off of security control, we're going
[1:42:35.340 --> 1:42:40.580]  to have Capitol Police as people have testified to already in criminal trials, wave people
[1:42:40.580 --> 1:42:44.740]  in to the, what happened, then none of that would have happened.
[1:42:44.740 --> 1:42:46.820]  It happened because of Nancy Pelosi.
[1:42:46.820 --> 1:42:48.860]  It happened because of the mayor of DC.
[1:42:48.860 --> 1:42:50.660]  It happened because of Mitch McConnell.
[1:42:50.660 --> 1:42:53.300]  It happened because of the seventh floor at the FBI.
[1:42:53.300 --> 1:42:58.340]  It happened because of QAnon being a government based movement.
[1:42:58.340 --> 1:43:01.740]  We have over a hundred designs of t-shirts that just sit there in our warehouse.
[1:43:01.740 --> 1:43:06.580]  We need to sell those shirts to fund the operation, but we'd already made some orders on future
[1:43:06.580 --> 1:43:07.580]  shirts coming in.
[1:43:07.580 --> 1:43:08.580]  But these are all limited editions.
[1:43:08.580 --> 1:43:11.620]  So once these new shirts come in, we're going to sell those, and that's it.
[1:43:11.620 --> 1:43:15.860]  We'll have limited editions one at a time in the future, and when they're gone, they're
[1:43:15.860 --> 1:43:16.860]  gone.
[1:43:16.860 --> 1:43:18.380]  Well, here's the new limited edition shirt.
[1:43:18.380 --> 1:43:21.060]  This one is $24.95, a really nice fabric.
[1:43:21.060 --> 1:43:25.660]  Alex Jones was right on the front with a big red lightning bolt on the back, infowars.com.
[1:43:25.660 --> 1:43:29.740]  You talk about triggering, you talk about spreading the word, you talk about waking people up.
[1:43:29.740 --> 1:43:30.740]  Alex Jones was right.
[1:43:30.740 --> 1:43:34.220]  Fundraiser shirt, we need the funds to operate.
[1:43:34.220 --> 1:43:35.220]  Infowarsstore.com.
[1:43:35.220 --> 1:43:36.220]  Alex Jones was right.
[1:43:36.220 --> 1:43:37.620]  It's a gorgeous shirt.
[1:43:37.620 --> 1:43:38.620]  We're really proud of it.

[1:43:54.540 --> 1:43:59.020]  big on the back, available now for limited time, infowarsstore.com.
[1:43:59.020 --> 1:44:04.980]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons
[1:44:04.980 --> 1:44:06.820]  and chemicals added to the food.
[1:44:06.820 --> 1:44:07.820]  It's all come out.
[1:44:07.820 --> 1:44:12.060]  And they're doing that not because we're weak, but because we're made the image of God,
[1:44:12.060 --> 1:44:15.060]  the Creator, and we are powerful.
[1:44:15.060 --> 1:44:18.300]  And the social engineers fear that so much.
[1:44:18.300 --> 1:44:22.140]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up
[1:44:22.140 --> 1:44:25.940]  with the boy is it true.
[1:44:25.940 --> 1:44:31.780]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[1:44:31.780 --> 1:44:35.580]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural
[1:44:35.580 --> 1:44:42.260]  death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the God
[1:44:42.260 --> 1:44:44.020]  of this world who is a loser.
[1:44:44.020 --> 1:44:48.580]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep infowars on the air now more than ever.
[1:44:48.580 --> 1:44:52.420]  Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting
[1:44:52.420 --> 1:44:57.140]  up is a channel and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast
[1:44:57.140 --> 1:44:58.500]  they just announced.

[1:46:40.940 --> 1:46:43.260]  the spear, the info wars operation.
[1:46:43.260 --> 1:46:44.660]  It is a 360 win.
[1:46:44.660 --> 1:46:49.140]  The only way you fail is by not taking action and getting this product to boost your body's
[1:46:49.140 --> 1:46:51.740]  natural defenses and keep info wars on the air.
[1:46:51.740 --> 1:46:54.180]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action.
[1:46:54.180 --> 1:47:01.020]  Take action now, infowarsstore.com.
[1:47:01.020 --> 1:47:07.620]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:07.620 --> 1:47:15.700]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:15.700 --> 1:47:22.820]  Why is it that this January 6th committee that's so interested in the truth has failed
[1:47:22.820 --> 1:47:26.820]  to issue a single subpoena to anything related to QAnon?
[1:47:26.820 --> 1:47:29.700]  Why aren't they curious what the federal government has on QAnon?
[1:47:29.700 --> 1:47:31.900]  What are they curious about the FBI has on QAnon?
[1:47:31.900 --> 1:47:32.900]  Well, exactly.
[1:47:32.900 --> 1:47:36.740]  If I've gotten a proffer with them, I'm going to ask them about reabsion.
[1:47:36.740 --> 1:47:42.700]  They had a thousand armed secret FBI there, and they want to ask me what happened?
[1:47:42.700 --> 1:47:44.500]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[1:47:44.500 --> 1:47:50.540]  It's like asking a kid at Christmas morning who Santa Claus is.
[1:47:50.540 --> 1:47:53.500]  It's like Santa Claus going, who is Christmas, young boy?
[1:47:53.500 --> 1:47:59.180]  It's like they literally ran the show, and then they're asking me what happened.
[1:47:59.180 --> 1:48:05.780]  It's asking someone who was the victim of their attempted entrapment about the entrapment.
[1:48:05.780 --> 1:48:08.460]  The entrapment is what the federal agents were doing.
[1:48:08.460 --> 1:48:12.460]  The entrapment is what the Capitol Police were doing, and the reality is they thought
[1:48:12.460 --> 1:48:18.060]  because they had been busy watching Showtime's version of you, they thought you would rush
[1:48:18.060 --> 1:48:22.980]  in there instead of rushing up to tell people to get out of there, to asking the Capitol
[1:48:22.980 --> 1:48:26.860]  Police to broadcast you telling people to get out of there.
[1:48:26.860 --> 1:48:31.100]  You saved a lot of people's lives that day by your actions, and you weren't supposed
[1:48:31.100 --> 1:48:36.060]  to because their script had you being this fictional caricature rather than being the
[1:48:36.060 --> 1:48:39.380]  populist icon that you are, and they couldn't deal with that.
[1:48:39.380 --> 1:48:40.980]  They still can't deal with that.
[1:48:40.980 --> 1:48:45.420]  So they're still in fake script land rather than real world land when the real author
[1:48:45.420 --> 1:48:49.980]  of the January 6th script is some folks at the 7th floor at the FBI.
[1:48:49.980 --> 1:48:50.980]  I agree.
[1:48:50.980 --> 1:48:53.020]  So, Barnes, come back with me this week.
[1:48:53.020 --> 1:48:54.020]  You've been hard to get on.
[1:48:54.020 --> 1:48:55.020]  You used to come on a lot.
[1:48:55.020 --> 1:48:56.020]  Where have you been?
[1:48:56.020 --> 1:48:58.020]  I've been trying to get you on for a month.
[1:48:58.020 --> 1:48:59.020]  Oh, yeah.
[1:48:59.020 --> 1:49:01.940]  Well, I finally have some more free time.
[1:49:01.940 --> 1:49:05.780]  We've been in the middle of representing the whistleblower and the big pharma cases against
[1:49:05.780 --> 1:49:10.020]  the vaccine, representing Showtime's health defense, trying to end the vaccine mandate
[1:49:10.020 --> 1:49:14.580]  or vaccine authorization for children, and the vaccine authorization for the soldiers.
[1:49:14.580 --> 1:49:15.580]  That's important work.
[1:49:15.580 --> 1:49:16.580]  Yeah.
[1:49:16.580 --> 1:49:17.580]  So, yeah.
[1:49:17.580 --> 1:49:18.580]  Sorry.
[1:49:18.580 --> 1:49:19.580]  But yeah, yeah.
[1:49:19.580 --> 1:49:20.580]  The money raised that day.
[1:49:20.580 --> 1:49:23.020]  You're a leading expert on the COVID power grab.
[1:49:23.020 --> 1:49:24.780]  Just give us a stalt of what it is.
[1:49:24.780 --> 1:49:26.180]  I'm going to give you the floor.
[1:49:26.180 --> 1:49:28.980]  I'm going to be listening here in my audio piece.
[1:49:28.980 --> 1:49:31.220]  I'm going to hit the boys room while I'm listening to you.
[1:49:31.220 --> 1:49:32.380]  I got my earpiece here.
[1:49:32.380 --> 1:49:33.380]  It's wireless.
[1:49:33.380 --> 1:49:37.900]  I want to hear what you think about the COVID power grab.
[1:49:37.900 --> 1:49:38.900]  What happened?
[1:49:38.900 --> 1:49:39.900]  Postmortem?
[1:49:39.900 --> 1:49:40.900]  Why they backed off?
[1:49:40.900 --> 1:49:41.900]  What's coming next?
[1:49:41.900 --> 1:49:42.900]  New lockdowns.
[1:49:42.900 --> 1:49:46.940]  We know they're getting planned because you are one of the most articulate people.
[1:49:46.940 --> 1:49:47.940]  Probably the most.
[1:49:47.940 --> 1:49:48.940]  They're like Robert Kennedy Jr.
[1:49:48.940 --> 1:49:52.060]  I think you're probably the most articulate on that.
[1:49:52.060 --> 1:49:53.420]  I love Reimer Fulmick.
[1:49:53.420 --> 1:50:00.060]  He's amazing as well, but what happened with COVID and what's coming next, Robert Barnes?
[1:50:00.060 --> 1:50:04.780]  So I mean, ultimately, they use the pandemic as a pretext to engage in mass control.
[1:50:04.780 --> 1:50:06.900]  And this is about mass control at a core level.
[1:50:06.900 --> 1:50:09.780]  So, why Bill Gates has been involved in this for almost 20 years.
[1:50:09.780 --> 1:50:12.180]  His father was a big Planned Parenthood guy.
[1:50:12.180 --> 1:50:15.500]  Grandfather was a eugenics-connected guy.
[1:50:15.500 --> 1:50:18.340]  There's a reason why he says, why does he like vaccines?
[1:50:18.340 --> 1:50:22.060]  Because he believes it will reduce the public population, reduce the world population.
[1:50:22.060 --> 1:50:24.500]  These are people that are fundamentally about control.
[1:50:24.500 --> 1:50:29.020]  Why does he invest in technology that involves global digital currency with a chip that can
[1:50:29.020 --> 1:50:33.700]  go into your body, that also invest in a chip that can monitor your health, a chip that
[1:50:33.700 --> 1:50:37.340]  will have all your private medical records and financial information on it, and a chip
[1:50:37.340 --> 1:50:41.380]  that might have vaccine information on it, because that chip can be used to control you.
[1:50:41.380 --> 1:50:45.220]  It's global control, and he's sort of one of the leading spokespersons for it.
[1:50:45.220 --> 1:50:49.500]  You can go back to his 2009 meeting where he was called a superhero because the meeting
[1:50:49.500 --> 1:50:54.460]  leaked thanks to a good maid, and Honest Maid said, what is George Soros, David Rockefeller,
[1:50:54.460 --> 1:50:58.740]  Bill Gates, Oprah, and all these other Bill and Bloomberg sitting around talking about.
[1:50:58.740 --> 1:51:04.060]  They were talking about how to control the world, global control, control at the micro-level
[1:51:04.060 --> 1:51:06.020]  and at the macro level.
[1:51:06.020 --> 1:51:10.620]  And that's what this was all about used, but they need emergencies and excuses to do it.
[1:51:10.620 --> 1:51:14.340]  Just like, well, why do we create a criminal justice system that perpetrates a permanent
[1:51:14.340 --> 1:51:15.820]  criminal class?
[1:51:15.820 --> 1:51:17.540]  Because that justifies the police.
[1:51:17.540 --> 1:51:19.180]  No crime, no police.
[1:51:19.180 --> 1:51:23.580]  Why do we keep creating enemies around the world, sometimes real, sometimes fake, but
[1:51:23.580 --> 1:51:28.180]  often because of our instigation, our infiltration, our involvement, our support?
[1:51:28.180 --> 1:51:30.060]  Because again, no enemy, no war.
[1:51:30.060 --> 1:51:36.260]  The war machine needs enemies in order to justify war just as the state needs crime in
[1:51:36.260 --> 1:51:39.820]  order to justify police control of its own populations.
[1:51:39.820 --> 1:51:44.820]  In the same context, emergencies like public health emergencies justify and rationalize
[1:51:44.820 --> 1:51:50.500]  this managerial class's monopoly on power, and what does Cuba say makes their government
[1:51:50.500 --> 1:51:51.500]  so great?
[1:51:51.500 --> 1:51:53.420]  They stopped COVID from coming to Cuba.
[1:51:53.420 --> 1:51:57.580]  Why is there another lockdown in Shanghai where people are spending their nights screaming
[1:51:57.580 --> 1:52:04.380]  from the balcony, begging for food, sacrificing their animals rather than being able to survive
[1:52:04.380 --> 1:52:07.380]  another day or just to survive another day?
[1:52:07.380 --> 1:52:12.060]  Because China's managerial class says, we stopped COVID and we stopped them with these
[1:52:12.060 --> 1:52:13.740]  extreme control policies.
[1:52:13.740 --> 1:52:18.100]  We need to control you in order to stop this terrible disease.
[1:52:18.100 --> 1:52:22.020]  We need to have this massive power in order to keep you safe.
[1:52:22.020 --> 1:52:25.620]  And that's the mindset of these groups, and that's what they did, and the vaccines were
[1:52:25.620 --> 1:52:26.620]  just part of it.
[1:52:26.620 --> 1:52:29.260]  It was a natural, logical extension of it.
[1:52:29.260 --> 1:52:33.700]  That's why Alex and I and others, and Robert Bobby Kennedy, were talking about it from
[1:52:33.700 --> 1:52:34.700]  day one.
[1:52:34.700 --> 1:52:38.460]  We're saying this is their objective, this is their goal, they want total control.
[1:52:38.460 --> 1:52:43.380]  And what bigger, better control is there than putting something in your body that ultimately
[1:52:43.380 --> 1:52:45.980]  can be used to control you and things like chips.
[1:52:45.980 --> 1:52:51.100]  But here we had an mRNA vaccine, not just any vaccine, an mRNA vaccine, so as to get
[1:52:51.100 --> 1:52:55.380]  you conditioned to accept the state sticking in your body, whatever they want.
[1:52:55.380 --> 1:52:58.140]  And if you don't own your own body, what do you own?
[1:52:58.140 --> 1:53:01.980]  We're back to the era of eugenics, and it's not a coincidence they cited eugenics era
[1:53:01.980 --> 1:53:06.380]  court decisions as their legal basis for this massive power grab.
[1:53:06.380 --> 1:53:10.060]  But they had to do it in hiding, because all the big drug companies knew their product
[1:53:10.060 --> 1:53:13.740]  likely didn't work, because there's never been a successful coronavirus vaccine in
[1:53:13.740 --> 1:53:17.940]  history, because there's never been a successful mRNA vaccine in history.
[1:53:17.940 --> 1:53:19.780]  So here they were doing both.
[1:53:19.780 --> 1:53:22.020]  And so how are they going to sell it to the ordinary person?
[1:53:22.020 --> 1:53:24.620]  How are they going to sucker the ordinary person into doing it?
[1:53:24.620 --> 1:53:27.820]  Well, the drug companies weren't going to do it if they were on the hook.
[1:53:27.820 --> 1:53:32.540]  So they demanded that everything be done under emergency use authorization.
[1:53:32.540 --> 1:53:36.540]  So this emergency, which started out as two weeks to flatten the curve, became two years
[1:53:36.540 --> 1:53:38.220]  to control your life.
[1:53:38.220 --> 1:53:39.220]  And that's what they did.
[1:53:39.220 --> 1:53:47.140]  In fact, to this day, here, the FDA has approved a biologic licensed drug for both vaccines
[1:53:47.140 --> 1:53:49.100]  for Moderna and Pfizer.
[1:53:49.100 --> 1:53:55.660]  And yet that Pfizer FDA approved drug, the Moderna FDA biologic licensed approved drug,
[1:53:55.660 --> 1:53:59.540]  is still not available in the United States of America.
[1:53:59.540 --> 1:54:04.460]  Instead, the only thing that's available is the emergency use authorized drug.
[1:54:04.460 --> 1:54:05.620]  Why is that?
[1:54:05.620 --> 1:54:10.260]  Because the emergency use authorized drug has complete immunity from suit.
[1:54:10.260 --> 1:54:14.020]  There's some folks out there that think you can sue them for willful misconduct.
[1:54:14.020 --> 1:54:16.180]  Unfortunately, the answer is no.
[1:54:16.180 --> 1:54:20.540]  You can only sue them for willful misconduct if the government agrees with you.
[1:54:20.540 --> 1:54:21.620]  That's the little loophole.
[1:54:21.620 --> 1:54:22.980]  That's the little footnote.
[1:54:22.980 --> 1:54:24.520]  That's the little exception.
[1:54:24.520 --> 1:54:28.700]  So consequently, you as an ordinary person have no remedy.
[1:54:28.700 --> 1:54:31.380]  Insurance companies are denying insurance coverage because they're saying, hey, this was
[1:54:31.380 --> 1:54:33.620]  an experimental drug.
[1:54:33.620 --> 1:54:37.620]  Insurance companies are denying workers compensation coverage saying, hey, you chose to get it.
[1:54:37.620 --> 1:54:40.300]  So that's that even when there was a mandate in place.
[1:54:40.300 --> 1:54:44.220]  So you have all the risk and they have all the reward.
[1:54:44.220 --> 1:54:49.620]  And what we're seeing is the real risk health wise, initially, the fear concern was long
[1:54:49.620 --> 1:54:54.140]  tail risk because we don't know what would happen with an mRNA vaccine.
[1:54:54.140 --> 1:54:57.180]  We've never had a successful coronavirus vaccine.
[1:54:57.180 --> 1:54:59.140]  This was a novel technology.
[1:54:59.140 --> 1:55:04.700]  The concern was that five years, 10 years, 20 years down the road for this untested vaccine
[1:55:04.700 --> 1:55:09.220]  for that kind of length of time, for this kind of virus, for this kind of drug would
[1:55:09.220 --> 1:55:13.940]  have all kinds of unanticipated horrible health effects.
[1:55:13.940 --> 1:55:18.060]  But now we've had horrible health effects within three months, within six months, within
[1:55:18.060 --> 1:55:19.820]  a year of people getting this.
[1:55:19.820 --> 1:55:22.260]  We're seeing extraordinary rates.
[1:55:22.260 --> 1:55:28.260]  We have blown through every limit that ever existed for public health consequences, adverse
[1:55:28.260 --> 1:55:30.460]  consequences to any vaccine.
[1:55:30.460 --> 1:55:34.700]  We've broken all the records and it's the wrong records that we've been breaking.
[1:55:34.700 --> 1:55:37.580]  And the consequences, we see the athletes dropping dead.
[1:55:37.580 --> 1:55:44.340]  We see the excess mortality rate went up 40% in certain categories of people right after
[1:55:44.340 --> 1:55:45.340]  they took the vaccine.
[1:55:45.340 --> 1:55:46.500]  And that's from major insurance companies.
[1:55:46.500 --> 1:55:47.500]  So let me ask you this.
[1:55:47.500 --> 1:55:50.060]  This is the most powerful interview ever, Barnes.
[1:55:50.060 --> 1:55:51.900]  The whole crew is just blown away by everything you're saying.
[1:55:51.900 --> 1:55:52.900]  It's totally true.
[1:55:52.900 --> 1:55:57.700]  I'm going to re-air this Sunday, I have plenty to say, but we're going to air this interview
[1:55:57.700 --> 1:56:01.220]  Sunday in the second hour of the Sunday live show.
[1:56:01.220 --> 1:56:04.340]  I'll be there in the first hour, but people have got to hear this.
[1:56:04.340 --> 1:56:11.020]  Obviously, they were scared of Trump and populism and Bolsonaro and others and Orban.
[1:56:11.020 --> 1:56:12.780]  And they admitted they did all this.
[1:56:12.780 --> 1:56:14.980]  Trump, I believe you know him well, means well.
[1:56:14.980 --> 1:56:15.980]  He got suckered into it.
[1:56:15.980 --> 1:56:16.980]  It doesn't mean he's wrong.
[1:56:16.980 --> 1:56:20.540]  At least he's not promoting this gene therapy shot now.
[1:56:20.540 --> 1:56:23.020]  But regardless, it blew up in their face.
[1:56:23.020 --> 1:56:27.900]  They've had to back off at least for a time when they intended to have the lockdown go
[1:56:27.900 --> 1:56:29.900]  forever, obviously.
[1:56:29.900 --> 1:56:36.580]  So how would you describe the world right now geopolitically with what's happening?
[1:56:36.580 --> 1:56:39.820]  Because the globalists are failing on every front.
[1:56:39.820 --> 1:56:41.100]  They've got incompetent minions.
[1:56:41.100 --> 1:56:44.380]  They want to run in charge because they don't want to have a real president or somebody that
[1:56:44.380 --> 1:56:46.860]  wants to be their own person.
[1:56:46.860 --> 1:56:52.100]  So their own attempts to have no one in charge because they're in charge, but they're not
[1:56:52.100 --> 1:56:54.260]  in charge is the real danger.
[1:56:54.260 --> 1:56:58.100]  And I mean, I just see major problems here.
[1:56:58.100 --> 1:57:01.740]  They think we want to be the new aristocrats.
[1:57:01.740 --> 1:57:06.460]  They think we're battling for freedom because we want to be king.
[1:57:06.460 --> 1:57:11.060]  Like when they offered George Washington to be king, he said, no, I don't want to be king.
[1:57:11.060 --> 1:57:18.620]  And King George III finally woke up and put the American flag up and then said, OK, George
[1:57:18.620 --> 1:57:24.380]  Washington is the greatest man in the world because he beat them and then he didn't take
[1:57:24.380 --> 1:57:25.380]  the power.
[1:57:25.380 --> 1:57:29.860]  People don't know that when George Washington died, they ran American flags up in the UK
[1:57:29.860 --> 1:57:33.700]  in England because they thought they would double cross with the British, use that to
[1:57:33.700 --> 1:57:35.700]  parlance to take over the Caribbean.
[1:57:35.700 --> 1:57:36.700]  And no, George Washington did that.
[1:57:36.700 --> 1:57:39.260]  He said, no, we wanted freedom.
[1:57:39.260 --> 1:57:41.140]  We don't want to be in power.
[1:57:41.140 --> 1:57:42.580]  We don't want to run people.
[1:57:42.580 --> 1:57:43.900]  We want to empower people.
[1:57:43.900 --> 1:57:51.660]  And that idea, not that America is perfect, but that idea of it is about 25 years ago
[1:57:51.660 --> 1:57:53.060]  that I wanted to expand in for worse.
[1:57:53.060 --> 1:57:57.180]  I've been on the air a couple of years, but I only had money to finance my own simple
[1:57:57.180 --> 1:57:58.180]  little local radio show.
[1:57:58.180 --> 1:58:00.780]  And I wanted to hire camera people to make films.
[1:58:00.780 --> 1:58:02.780]  I wanted to really challenge the globalist.
[1:58:02.780 --> 1:58:04.580]  And it was a t-shirt I designed.
[1:58:04.580 --> 1:58:10.540]  The first one mass murderers agreed gun control works that helped us finance hiring the first
[1:58:10.540 --> 1:58:13.980]  members of my crew, that's our oldest design, and he's still selling.
[1:58:13.980 --> 1:58:19.220]  We have that design over 100 others that will now all be limited editions because whatever
[1:58:19.220 --> 1:58:24.140]  stock we've got in, that's it, we're selling everything out to find the courage to get
[1:58:24.140 --> 1:58:25.140]  rid of inventory.
[1:58:25.140 --> 1:58:28.780]  We'll still have some teachers in the future, they'll just be limited editions and short
[1:58:28.780 --> 1:58:29.780]  runs.
[1:58:29.780 --> 1:58:33.220]  So if you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last chance on almost
[1:58:33.220 --> 1:58:34.220]  forgotten.
[1:58:34.220 --> 1:58:38.020]  We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.
[1:58:38.020 --> 1:58:43.700]  Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie, every long sleeve, every t-shirt, regular shirts,

[1:58:56.940 --> 1:59:00.780]  Infowars has made it easier to make sure you're getting enough in your system with a supplement
[1:59:00.780 --> 1:59:02.380]  that contains both.

[1:59:07.380 --> 1:59:08.980]  from the info wars store.
[1:59:08.980 --> 1:59:13.780]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that
[1:59:13.780 --> 1:59:16.500]  contain the rose plant seeds.
[1:59:16.500 --> 1:59:21.340]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[1:59:21.340 --> 1:59:26.020]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[1:59:26.020 --> 1:59:27.020]  shown.
[1:59:27.020 --> 1:59:31.300]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important
[1:59:31.300 --> 1:59:35.900]  role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[1:59:35.900 --> 1:59:40.980]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations
[1:59:40.980 --> 1:59:41.980]  like here in America.
[1:59:41.980 --> 1:59:46.820]  So next time you visit be sure to check it out at infowarsstore.com where we promise
