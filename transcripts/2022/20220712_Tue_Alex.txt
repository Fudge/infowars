[00:00.000 --> 00:18.240]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:30.000 --> 00:51.280]  It's Tuesday, July 12th, and it host Alex Jones, coming to you from the embattled Infowars
[00:51.280 --> 00:53.280]  headquarters in ATX.
[00:53.280 --> 01:02.320]  Wow, the worldwide awakening against the New World Order has exploded.
[01:02.320 --> 01:09.560]  They're flying the Gadsden flag in Argentina, in Venezuela, in Sri Lanka, in Eastern Europe,
[01:09.560 --> 01:13.400]  in the UK, right here in the United States and Canada.
[01:13.400 --> 01:18.040]  The Chinese are raiding and taking over the Communist Party's central banks, the same
[01:18.040 --> 01:20.280]  things happening in many other countries.
[01:20.280 --> 01:26.360]  Dutch farmers are torching the properties of Bill Gates and more.
[01:26.360 --> 01:32.480]  They intended to cut off the energy and food and have us all kill each other, but instead,
[01:32.480 --> 01:39.760]  we have identified the enemy, and now the real war starts.
[01:39.760 --> 01:45.120]  But the Empire will strike back with controlled power outages that they are now saying are
[01:45.120 --> 01:48.680]  imminent to be launched by Russia.
[01:48.680 --> 01:51.920]  And they are accelerating the destruction of the Third World to flood the First World
[01:51.920 --> 01:54.080]  and collapse us all.
[01:54.080 --> 01:56.440]  But at least we're in the fight and not backing down.
[01:56.440 --> 01:58.360]  At least we know who we're up against.
[01:58.360 --> 02:01.200]  At least we're not going blind into this struggle.
[02:01.200 --> 02:10.800]  We have God and our ancestors on our side, and we will prevail.
[02:10.800 --> 02:16.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, the news is incredible.
[02:16.080 --> 02:19.040]  Let me give you just one example of this, and I'm sure they'll take it down and block
[02:19.040 --> 02:20.040]  it.
[02:20.040 --> 02:24.040]  And I'm going to be covering this more next segment.
[02:24.040 --> 02:28.960]  But Alex's War is a documentary that's very fair, shows the good, the bad, and the ugly
[02:28.960 --> 02:33.480]  of things I've done, and I haven't even really promoted it yet.
[02:33.480 --> 02:38.520]  And it has gone, once it went on pre-order two days ago, out of thousands of films that
[02:38.520 --> 02:46.360]  you can pre-order, to number four, number four, ladies and gentlemen, just behind Top
[02:46.360 --> 02:52.000]  Gun, Jurassic World, and the Justice League.
[02:52.000 --> 03:01.520]  We've pulled past Elvis, Man of God, Facing Nolan, Freedom, and so many other major Hollywood
[03:01.520 --> 03:02.520]  films.
[03:02.520 --> 03:05.920]  There is no independent films in the top 50.
[03:05.920 --> 03:12.680]  We are at number four, headed to number one, as usual.
[03:12.680 --> 03:17.000]  And that absolutely pisses the establishment off to no end.
[03:17.000 --> 03:22.200]  Again, I won't get any money from this film, but I want to encourage independent filmmaking.
[03:22.200 --> 03:25.120]  And the filmmaker that made it, it's won a lot of awards.
[03:25.120 --> 03:30.560]  And when I saw the film a few months ago at a private screening here in Austin at the
[03:30.560 --> 03:35.760]  Violet Crown, it did bring tears to my eyes what we've gone through in the last 28 years.
[03:35.760 --> 03:39.960]  And the amazing crew members we have here, and it is a hell of a movie.
[03:39.960 --> 03:42.120]  They asked me what I thought of it.
[03:42.120 --> 03:45.760]  And I said, you know, I think you're too nice to me.
[03:45.760 --> 03:48.920]  And it shows negative things about me.
[03:48.920 --> 03:57.240]  It's just that the film is going to really send shockwaves throughout the system.
[03:57.240 --> 04:03.720]  And it's going to be seen by tens of millions of people, and it's going to scare the hell
[04:03.720 --> 04:07.160]  out of the New World Order even further.
[04:07.160 --> 04:11.680]  So to Alex Morrier and the rest of her team, congratulations on the big success.
[04:11.680 --> 04:17.040]  I'm sure they'll pull it off of Apple Movies, and that'll only piss people off more and
[04:17.040 --> 04:18.640]  make them want it more.
[04:18.640 --> 04:19.960]  So get ready for that.
[04:19.960 --> 04:21.920]  It's about to hit all the other charts.
[04:21.920 --> 04:27.200]  It's going to be in theaters, in select cities coming up at the end of the month.
[04:27.200 --> 04:30.360]  And word is that those are going to all sell out.
[04:30.360 --> 04:37.920]  So you can see this film in thousands of movie theaters across the United States.
[04:37.920 --> 04:41.360]  So they are definitely very upset about that.
[04:41.360 --> 04:48.040]  Turns out freedom and being a rebel is extremely positive.
[04:48.040 --> 04:52.840]  And there's a lot of other tricks up God's sleeve because all glory goes to God.
[04:52.840 --> 05:00.880]  WorldWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[05:00.880 --> 05:06.280]  Seven months ago in December of 2021, we launched the first in the three-coin founding member
[05:06.280 --> 05:09.280]  series, George Washington slaying the dragon.
[05:09.280 --> 05:13.480]  Then we launched the Tree of Liberty coin and finally the second amendment, come and
[05:13.480 --> 05:15.480]  take it, Molan Labe coin.
[05:15.480 --> 05:25.480]  There are only 75 coins left in the three-point series exclusively right now at 1776point.com.
[05:25.480 --> 05:31.040]  And for the final 75 people to become founding members for this big project we're launching
[05:31.040 --> 05:36.520]  in the near future, you'll also get a personal signed piece of art I made of the sheepdog
[05:36.520 --> 05:38.480]  chasing the wolf in a personal message.
[05:38.480 --> 05:45.240]  It's your last chance to get all three coins at 1776point.com.
[05:45.240 --> 05:50.680]  This is history happening now, Info War Station support is changing the world, and this is
[05:50.680 --> 06:03.640]  the final 75 three-coin set exclusively available at 1776point.com.
[06:03.640 --> 06:13.800]  The answer to tyranny, the answer to 1984 is 1776, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting
[06:13.800 --> 06:18.080]  worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[06:18.080 --> 06:23.520]  Our archivist as we speak was just given the mission 30 minutes ago, is going into the
[06:23.520 --> 06:29.320]  prisonplanet.tv archives that are now free to the world, and is grabbing clips going
[06:29.320 --> 06:34.800]  back 15 years ago, and again 10 years ago, and again five years ago, and again a year
[06:34.800 --> 06:43.400]  ago when I called for operation 1776 worldwide.
[06:43.400 --> 06:46.400]  And the enemies of freedom really fear that.
[06:46.400 --> 06:49.920]  We've had the Justice Department, the FBI call us, they've had congressional hearings,
[06:49.920 --> 06:57.960]  they've had thousands of news articles, dreading the name 1776, the number 1776, and saying
[06:57.960 --> 07:03.680]  Jones calls for violence when he invoked 1776.
[07:03.680 --> 07:10.360]  Well on July 4th when I was grilling hamburgers in the backyard with my wife and youngest
[07:10.360 --> 07:19.920]  daughter, empty nest, the other kids are moved on and old now, wild time flies, that we rejoiced
[07:19.920 --> 07:24.440]  and said a little prayer, thanking God for America in 1776.
[07:24.440 --> 07:39.440]  July 4th is 1776, America is 1776, the Declaration of Independence is 1776, you're either 1776
[07:39.440 --> 07:51.880]  or you're 1984, baby I'm betting on 1776 all day long, and I've never gotten a tattoo,
[07:51.880 --> 07:55.360]  but I think I'm going to get one.
[07:55.360 --> 08:02.280]  I'm tempted to get a big ass gang tattoo right across my chest that says 1776, because it's
[08:02.280 --> 08:13.640]  like crosses to vampires or high noon to Nosferatu and Count Dracula and Count Chocula to invoke
[08:13.640 --> 08:20.560]  that logo, that symbol, that sigil.
[08:20.560 --> 08:29.960]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, every time I think about this guy, I forget his name because
[08:29.960 --> 08:37.200]  I just do it off the cuff, but I was at Bilderberg in 2006 in Canada, I'd just been arrested
[08:37.200 --> 08:41.000]  trying to fly in, trying to cover it, it was a big media frenzy, backed in the media, still
[08:41.000 --> 08:43.800]  stuck up for journalists even though they didn't like me, and they released me after
[08:43.800 --> 08:48.080]  a day of being interrogated and screamed at and threatened with prison, and I was going
[08:48.080 --> 08:51.440]  to be raped in the Toronto jail because I was in Ottawa but they said we're going to
[08:51.440 --> 08:57.680]  take you there, you're going to be raped in the jail, and they finally released me, and
[08:57.680 --> 09:00.760]  when I got to the hotel I met with Jim Tucker, the hotel miles away from where Bilderberg
[09:00.760 --> 09:06.120]  was about to meet the next day, there was an old man at the bar drinking a beer, he said
[09:06.120 --> 09:09.680]  now it's like drinking beer with you, and I said sure, he's a British man, I said you
[09:09.680 --> 09:13.960]  live in County, he said yeah, I've lived here since the 90s, and I didn't know he was dying
[09:13.960 --> 09:20.360]  at the time, he died a few months later, forget his exact name, he's in in-game with his name,
[09:20.360 --> 09:26.560]  and he said you know I used to be a well-known economist in the UK, I've been at the highest
[09:26.560 --> 09:30.400]  levels of the whole socialist global system, I've met with many of these people, and early
[09:30.400 --> 09:33.800]  on I kind of believed the lie they were selling about how it was utopia and freedom and the
[09:33.800 --> 09:36.720]  power of the average person, but really they want to make everybody poor and control them,
[09:36.720 --> 09:42.000]  he said I think you need to use this slogan I just developed, because I'm a mathematician,
[09:42.000 --> 09:46.960]  not just an economist, he said but it's not an equation, it's an archetypal symbol and
[09:46.960 --> 09:55.040]  numbers, it's very eloquent, he said the answer to 1984 is 1776, and I interviewed him and
[09:55.040 --> 10:00.600]  talked to him, and it wasn't until we started looking into him for the film, that it turned
[10:00.600 --> 10:06.920]  out he was the main economist to two prime ministers, he was the guy, he was a guy who
[10:06.920 --> 10:11.440]  was super famous, I just you know didn't know that in the 80s he'd been working for
[10:11.440 --> 10:16.440]  Margaret Thatcher and all the rest of it, but the point is that's where that came from
[10:16.440 --> 10:21.520]  was from a Brit, which is perfect, because you know our revolution came out of England,
[10:21.520 --> 10:25.920]  it was an extension of George Washington's grandparents and Thomas Jefferson's grandparents
[10:25.920 --> 10:29.320]  and parents, and people that came to the New World to get away from tyranny, and England
[10:29.320 --> 10:36.000]  had revolutions like ours trying to get freedom, so America is not an anti-British thing,
[10:36.000 --> 10:42.680]  America is not an anti-Anglo-Saxon thing, America it comes out of Magna Carta in 1215,
[10:42.680 --> 10:48.680]  it comes out of all those wars and rebellions and fights for freedom in Ireland, in Scotland,
[10:48.680 --> 10:56.040]  in Wales, in Brittany, that is an extension of who we are, and it's so fitting that a
[10:56.040 --> 11:05.960]  Brit and an economist came up with that powerful maxim that they fear so much, the answer to
[11:05.960 --> 11:24.240]  1984 is 1776, because 1776 came from England, 1776 is England, and I gave that speech at
[11:24.240 --> 11:31.840]  Bilderberg in 2010 outside London, this beautiful rolling of states, they had a lock down helicopter
[11:31.840 --> 11:37.280]  landing, British Prime Minister there, world leaders, royalty, and there was 5,000 people
[11:37.280 --> 11:48.520]  from Britain, and I had them chanting, the answer to 1984 is 1776, but 1776 doesn't just
[11:48.520 --> 11:56.760]  belong to the United Kingdom, it doesn't just belong to America, it doesn't just belong
[11:56.760 --> 12:06.520]  to Canada or Australia, it belongs to Mexico and Brazil and Sri Lanka and Japan and Russia,
[12:06.520 --> 12:18.280]  it belongs to France, it belongs anywhere, anybody, in Africa or Libya or Kenya or Nigeria,
[12:18.280 --> 12:23.320]  anywhere people have freedom beating in their breast and want due process and want to be
[12:23.320 --> 12:27.040]  treated like free humans and own property and be able to worship the gods they choose
[12:27.040 --> 12:36.760]  or not worship those gods, that is 1776, they try to make us ashamed of it and say it's
[12:36.760 --> 12:40.280]  a hate word and a violence word and something we shouldn't use and that's why we should
[12:40.280 --> 12:49.320]  use it more and more and more and more and more and more and more, because more powerful
[12:49.320 --> 12:56.880]  than even the American flag is the genesis point of the 1776 movement and what I launched
[12:56.880 --> 13:01.200]  15 years ago when we first moved into these studios, that little studio over there in
[13:01.200 --> 13:12.280]  the corner when we announced 1776 worldwide and I can tell you the answer to their great
[13:12.280 --> 13:20.320]  reset is the great awakening and the slogan, the heart, the blood, the truth, the progenitor,
[13:20.320 --> 13:26.040]  the bona fides of this rebellion against tyranny worldwide for our future collectively together
[13:26.040 --> 13:39.400]  of every race, color and creed is 1776 worldwide, 1776 worldwide, 1776 planetary scale, the
[13:39.400 --> 13:48.480]  answer to their great reset and Klaus Schwab is 1776 and I'm just so proud to be involved
[13:48.480 --> 13:55.360]  in this and interfacing with all of you and I am really proud and thankful that God chose
[13:55.360 --> 14:00.520]  me and this important mission and chose you to be part of it as well and that Texas in
[14:00.520 --> 14:05.120]  the fight against the new world order with the progeneration and the triggering and the
[14:05.120 --> 14:12.080]  detonation of this massive cascade we're building towards as we battle for freedom in our future
[14:12.080 --> 14:18.480]  and our children that the epicenter of the worldwide contagion against the new world

[14:32.200 --> 14:37.480]  and my mother's family and the blessing of being the founders of Texas continues on to
[14:37.480 --> 14:43.880]  be the founders of the worldwide resistance with Gadsden flags flying worldwide against
[14:43.880 --> 14:57.240]  the new world order and the people coming together chanting the answer to 1984 is 1776
[14:57.240 --> 15:04.960]  belongs to everyone it is not British it is not American it is not South African it is
[15:04.960 --> 15:17.160]  not Chilean it is not Rwandan it is human and the answer to their 1984 hell of impoverishment
[15:17.160 --> 15:25.320]  and war and slavery and betrayal is honor and will and strength and glory and freedom
[15:25.320 --> 15:43.400]  and commitment and truth and it is 1776 1776 1776 1776 worldwide we will never be broken

[20:25.000 --> 20:38.760]  on the way to go to the ditch the pit the trap that our enemies prepare for us will
[20:38.760 --> 20:44.200]  be what they are delivered into just because they're evil and have a will to kill and
[20:44.200 --> 20:48.260]  hurt people doesn't mean they're always going to win in fact in the end they always fail
[20:48.260 --> 20:54.200]  they can't help it it's not confidence that the pedophiles are driven by it is their desire
[20:54.200 --> 20:59.400]  to destroy innocence and their whole pedophile network with this hunter biden phone coming
[20:59.400 --> 21:06.680]  out this hack of his iCloud is destroying them it is annihilating them it is decimating
[21:06.680 --> 21:14.040]  them and it's not just discrediting our corrupt government it's discrediting the controllers
[21:14.040 --> 21:19.600]  almost everybody now that's even halfway awake isn't going for the puppet they're going
[21:19.600 --> 21:24.880]  for the controller he that controls the marionette all right let me hit this right now we've
[21:24.880 --> 21:29.840]  got so much huge news today i'm super fired up a lot of incredible stuff i can't reveal
[21:29.840 --> 21:34.720]  to you yet behind the scenes but let me tell you the new world order is in a lot of trouble
[21:34.720 --> 21:40.200]  but i wanted to hit this first i was totally hands off i knew who alex moyer was because
[21:40.200 --> 21:46.520]  some of her award-winning films and she and her husband live here in austin texas and
[21:46.520 --> 21:50.160]  he's also a well-known filmmaker and so they approached me a couple years ago and said can
[21:50.160 --> 21:55.560]  we be a fly on the wall and have access to info wars and i said yes because i think you're
[21:55.560 --> 22:02.800]  real filmmakers that are avant-garde and you actually want to do cinema verite cinema truth
[22:02.800 --> 22:07.840]  and so their film shows a lot of negative stuff about me but it's quite frankly i mean
[22:07.840 --> 22:16.080]  i'll be honest more endearing to see how real we are and it's a very powerful two hour eleven
[22:16.080 --> 22:24.080]  minute film and it has gone to number four on one of the most critical important charts
[22:24.080 --> 22:30.240]  there is and that's apple apple is the second largest chart that there is it's not even offered
[22:30.240 --> 22:34.600]  on amazon yet and it comes out at the end of the month it's called alex's war documentary
[22:34.600 --> 22:39.400]  tops apple iTunes charts despite unprecedented censorship being blocked everywhere on every
[22:39.400 --> 22:48.640]  platform you can imagine and what's incredible about this is it's number four out of thousands
[22:48.640 --> 22:56.760]  of films that are on pre-order it was number six yesterday and if you look at what it's
[22:56.760 --> 23:03.240]  behind top gun which i did see and i thought would be cheesy it was way better than the
[23:03.240 --> 23:09.680]  first one is actually pro-america and pro-human and no wonder it's biggest movie they're saying
[23:09.680 --> 23:12.960]  ever made now because people are hungry for something that doesn't attack freedom and
[23:12.960 --> 23:18.880]  attack them so congratulations to tom cruise and that movie it's number one Jurassic worlds
[23:18.880 --> 23:23.040]  number two these are movies with hundred two hundred three hundred million dollar budgets
[23:23.040 --> 23:31.240]  and then there is a justice league and that's CGI nightmare and then we're right behind
[23:31.240 --> 23:36.600]  it then Elvis is behind us and a bunch of other big films so think about that these
[23:36.600 --> 23:40.880]  are all hundred two hundred three hundred four hundred million dollar films and then
[23:40.880 --> 23:47.760]  a film of the budget of i'm told a couple million bucks is about to be the number one
[23:47.760 --> 23:53.800]  film in pre-order and that means that massive numbers of people imagine how many pre-order
[23:53.800 --> 24:02.560]  top gun we're talking millions so a lot of people have gone there and pre-ordered it
[24:02.560 --> 24:06.440]  i have no financial stake in this i wish we did is get funder operation i don't care the
[24:06.440 --> 24:11.720]  point is you should go there you should pre-order it now and you see the left of the reviews
[24:11.720 --> 24:16.120]  haven't even seen it yet attacking it because they don't want you to see who alex jones
[24:16.120 --> 24:20.120]  really is they want to be able to demonize populism and demonize the american people
[24:20.120 --> 24:25.440]  and so we're all under attack flyover countries under attack and this is a film against all
[24:25.440 --> 24:33.720]  of that two hours eleven minutes long alex's war and it drops what the twenty ninth of
[24:33.720 --> 24:41.360]  july so in a couple weeks but here is a little two minute trailer and believe me it's way
[24:41.360 --> 24:46.360]  more powerful in this trailer here's a two minute trailer i'm alex jones the story you're
[24:46.360 --> 24:54.480]  about to see is truth this is reality truth is stranger than fiction i'm the most banned
[24:54.480 --> 24:59.160]  most evenized media person in the world alex jones is a fake and he's a performance artist
[24:59.160 --> 25:08.120]  i'm perceived as a clown to nut maniac on his website info wars he tells erin noia born
[25:08.120 --> 25:14.720]  the sickest most offensive theories alex jones claims that nine eleven and the oklahoma city
[25:14.720 --> 25:20.360]  bombings were inside jobs don't you stand for america sir he said me and hillary are
[25:20.360 --> 25:27.600]  demons hate that something you'll burn in hell i met him back in nineteen nineties i knew
[25:27.600 --> 25:32.520]  right away he was gonna be a star has my outlook i saw all these conspiracy theorists that were
[25:32.520 --> 25:39.720]  talking about the new world order i thought that's what i'll do was that attack on humanity
[25:39.720 --> 25:44.280]  i saw early on that i really wanted to waste war on you're lying to the public it's disgusting
[25:44.280 --> 25:51.680]  when she takes that there's no one back everything's a war that's the way the universe works and
[25:51.680 --> 25:56.320]  everything is propaganda i don't trust donald trump but i agree with probably ninety five
[25:56.320 --> 26:03.280]  percent of what donald trump says your reputation's amazing i will not let you down that's when
[26:03.280 --> 26:09.080]  the media loves off alex jones said the sandy hook shooting which claimed the lives of twenty
[26:09.080 --> 26:13.600]  children was fake i try to tell the truth and sometimes i'm wrong did the new york times
[26:13.600 --> 26:18.280]  get in trouble for consciously lying about wmd's that then led to a war killed tens of
[26:18.280 --> 26:24.800]  thousands of consulate no the attempts to platform us to fail they had the cia the fbi
[26:24.800 --> 26:29.080]  following me around now we gotta destroy alex jones we're not playing games here this is
[26:29.080 --> 26:38.320]  such a historic moment together it's all just insane okay let's put me in prison for questioning
[26:38.320 --> 26:41.960]  okay even though that's my right in fact let's execute alex jones let's let's put in front
[26:41.960 --> 26:47.880]  of a firing squad pull the trigger i have a sick feeling actually because i know it comes
[26:47.880 --> 26:57.800]  next all right alex's war you can go to info wars dot com to the live show feed today and
[26:57.800 --> 27:02.520]  right under the live show feed we have a link if you want to go pre-order the film and send
[27:02.520 --> 27:06.720]  a political message that means you will get it first when it drops on the twenty ninth
[27:06.720 --> 27:13.120]  and they'll probably cancel it when it hits number one they can't stand that um in game
[27:13.120 --> 27:18.880]  was number one on amazon they removed it out of the number one slot that was two thousand
[27:18.880 --> 27:25.200]  seven and they still let us sell it there and we sold now seven hundred thousand copies
[27:25.200 --> 27:30.160]  that's kept us on air and hundreds of thousands of digital copies but they just stopped promoting
[27:30.160 --> 27:35.640]  it and blocked it basically at that point because freedom isn't allowed to be popular
[27:35.640 --> 27:43.080]  ladies and gentlemen freedom is not something that they want to be promoted but again if
[27:43.080 --> 27:51.280]  you go to the apple store the second largest platform out there and you click on top preorders
[27:51.280 --> 28:01.880]  alex's war is number four behind top gun and Jurassic Park ahead of Elvis by the way
[28:01.880 --> 28:08.200]  I saw the Elvis movie that actor is amazing and by and I hate Tom Hanks but he did a good
[28:08.200 --> 28:13.360]  job as a slime bag that's who he is so I'm blown away that this is ahead of Elvis and
[28:13.360 --> 28:20.000]  right behind top gun which are both excellent films I haven't seen the Jurassic Park movies
[28:20.000 --> 28:24.680]  because I've already seen a Jurassic Park movie and they're so boring and stupid I can't put
[28:24.680 --> 28:32.040]  myself through that but that's just some of what some of what we're here covering today
[28:32.040 --> 28:36.720]  I'm done talking about that but it's a big deal for 1776 World Mind I hope you'll all

[33:44.680 --> 33:55.200]  Jr, oh my, oh my, they'd be everywhere this CNN would be running it around the clock this
[33:55.200 --> 34:01.240]  stuff would be everywhere and you wouldn't begin to spend it for the algo would be pushing
[34:01.240 --> 34:08.600]  you it'd be saying keep going you're doing well more more more more so you have to start
[34:08.600 --> 34:18.120]  to question yourself and say okay if CNN NBC are completely ignoring this story what does
[34:18.120 --> 34:29.440]  that say about the alignment of politics and so-called free press so whose side are you
[34:29.440 --> 34:38.600]  one remember at one point y'all said the media wouldn't be trusted now the media in the side
[34:38.600 --> 34:49.520]  that you side with are clearly in cahoots if there's a system of white supremacy it's
[34:49.520 --> 34:56.560]  got to be off it's got to be blue because the red don't get this favor if that was DeSantis
[34:56.560 --> 35:09.600]  Ted Cruz or one of these guys I'll be plastered all over the news are you complicit are you
[35:09.600 --> 35:17.680]  an ally are you a tool of this so-called system of white supremacy that the left reports not
[35:17.680 --> 35:28.920]  only are you a tool you have been assimilated I just said you you're not a tool you have
[35:28.920 --> 35:36.320]  been assimilated you in this system of dominance I'm not gonna call it white supremacy because
[35:36.320 --> 35:46.160]  it ain't white supremacy the system of dominance you are a battery in it you fuel it and then
[35:46.160 --> 35:58.240]  you blame others oh man the brainwashing has been executed at its finest mm-hmm just just
[35:58.240 --> 36:27.160]  great execution what hotel said is a hundred percent of the target total truth you better
[36:27.160 --> 36:32.160]  choose a side 1776 or 1984 you want to be a battery you want to be a slave you want to
[36:32.160 --> 36:37.000]  be a menu you want to be assimilated and pretend like this power structure to want to destroy
[36:37.000 --> 36:41.440]  you is on your side we got some videos next segment I'm gonna show you that illustrate
[36:41.440 --> 36:48.120]  this incredibly you will eat the bugs powerful great reset dystopian animation part two of
[36:48.120 --> 36:51.960]  what these great folks are putting out that's coming up next segment start of the segment
[36:51.960 --> 36:57.840]  but let's look at the facts here because this there's a twist to all of this look at this
[36:57.840 --> 37:05.640]  it's up on info wars.com video even CNN can't believe how low Biden's ratings are we're
[37:05.640 --> 37:13.640]  gonna play that clip in a moment but whose ratings are lower than his at 25 or 29 points
[37:13.640 --> 37:22.400]  betting on the poll and 94% of people 30 or younger don't like him but he won this election
[37:22.400 --> 37:28.380]  in a landslide with 89 million votes and the rise crispy elves are real and so is the Easter
[37:28.380 --> 37:37.400]  Bunny. New York Times dashes Joe Biden's 2024 hopes in six devastating articles that's Breitbart
[37:37.400 --> 37:42.720]  which is pathetic I'm not against Breitbart but man oh the New York Times says Biden isn't
[37:42.720 --> 37:47.560]  loved that's the reason he's gonna be removed is because the dying corporate media that
[37:47.560 --> 37:54.200]  lied about WMD's and Iraq said so no they stole the election they put a puppet in but
[37:54.200 --> 38:00.280]  he's too big a puppet it's too obvious it's backfired but instead oh my god the New York
[38:00.280 --> 38:07.640]  Times gets credit Biden's that isn't like because the New York Times said so New York
[38:07.640 --> 38:13.880]  Times is your enemy who doesn't want you to blame them they want you to blame this addled
[38:13.880 --> 38:19.920]  dementia-ridden puppet that reads off a cue card and this is what I bring up before I
[38:19.920 --> 38:30.600]  play the CNN clip Gallup trust in media hits record low it's less than 20% the only thing
[38:30.600 --> 38:37.480]  more unpopular in America than Democrat politicians and rhino cowards that go along with them
[38:37.480 --> 38:43.360]  is the media the corporate whore media that thought they'd censor everybody and thought
[38:43.360 --> 38:47.880]  they would do all their fact-checking and somehow we believe your crap all you did was
[38:47.880 --> 38:53.760]  make it backfire every liberal I know because I'm not a discriminator I don't turn my back
[38:53.760 --> 38:57.440]  on a liberal but I have a lot of friends family neighbors are liberals and they're all like
[38:57.440 --> 39:04.800]  you're right we're wrong we're I mean it's over for you it's over for you the Associated
[39:04.800 --> 39:10.200]  Press just fact-checked another meme all they did was boost it and then you know you got
[39:10.200 --> 39:14.480]  stuff like this and I'm not bashing northerners because I love all Americans whether you live
[39:14.480 --> 39:21.160]  in California or New York or wherever you live great people everywhere but I never heard
[39:21.160 --> 39:28.240]  the n-word in my life till I was traveling to the north around people and I never heard
[39:28.240 --> 39:32.560]  stuff like oh then black people down there they eat that they eat that fried chicken
[39:32.560 --> 39:37.200]  and that watermelon I'm like well if they can get away from me they can that's what southerners
[39:37.200 --> 39:43.680]  eat is watermelon and fried chicken and chitlins but northerners saw black people move up there
[39:43.680 --> 39:48.880]  and thought these weird ass black people they're eating chicken fried steaks and watermelon
[39:48.880 --> 39:56.120]  these are some weird people no they know what tastes good but these northerners and I love
[39:56.120 --> 40:01.440]  them to death the average mother but the weird white racist northerners obsess over food
[40:01.440 --> 40:05.080]  like what are you eating blackout peas for what are you eating collard greens for because
[40:05.080 --> 40:10.480]  that's what grandma makes you don't want them get out of my way you don't want cream gravy
[40:10.480 --> 40:17.280]  get out of my way you don't want chitlins get out of my way you go to east Texas run
[40:17.280 --> 40:22.520]  families from boy they think that's soul food that's not soul food that's southern food
[40:22.520 --> 40:27.440]  but the point is reason I raise this is it shows how disconnected these elites are more
[40:27.440 --> 40:33.200]  like when George W. Bush's dad Herbert Walker Bush famously in 89 was at a grocery store
[40:33.200 --> 40:40.240]  they'd had scanners for 20 years he goes what's this he never bought his own food so Jill
[40:40.240 --> 40:49.520]  Biden Dr. Jill Biden gets up and she goes you Mexicans are like tacos I mean a southerner
[40:49.520 --> 40:53.760]  never says oh we hate Mexicans they eat beans we eat beans too get out of the way I'ma steal
[40:53.760 --> 41:00.040]  your beans I'ma steal your refied brains your charro beans your black beans I mean all the
[41:00.040 --> 41:04.520]  Texans are filling up the Mexican food restaurants no matter what color they are gobbling up all
[41:04.520 --> 41:08.720]  that delicious Mexican food we don't look at a Mexican and go you look like a taco to
[41:08.720 --> 41:14.880]  me she said you Mexicans are awesome you're like tacos they're like what the hell does
[41:14.880 --> 41:20.960]  that mean like saying to a person in the UK I really like to UK you look like fish and
[41:20.960 --> 41:27.560]  chips to me let's just be honest UK it does not have very good food Mexicans and the Italians
[41:27.560 --> 41:34.560]  I think they they they got it they got it so the point is is that this is how weird the
[41:34.560 --> 41:41.200]  left is how disconnected they are we'll play the close one come back that she gets up she
[41:41.200 --> 41:47.680]  goes you Mexicans are like tacos you're so diverse what the hell but that's that weird
[41:47.680 --> 41:54.400]  elitist white blue blood thing where they just think everything that's not them is weird
[41:54.400 --> 41:58.680]  and and so they thought like like Hillary I like Mexicans I like hot sauce what the hell
[41:58.680 --> 42:06.640]  does that mean I'm saying I like white people I like T-bone steaks well everybody eats T-bone
[42:06.640 --> 42:12.280]  steaks not just white people but it's how weird their minds are and how elitist they
[42:12.280 --> 42:16.280]  are and how they're in their own world so we'll play Joe Biden we come back and we'll
[42:16.280 --> 42:22.880]  play CNN like laughing hey look how popular Joe Biden is except you're even lower it's
[42:22.880 --> 42:27.480]  like help the skelter coming down fast miles above you you think Papa Joe Biden's not popular
[42:27.480 --> 42:38.520]  CNN you're in the single digits unbelievable I mean what world do you get up in front of
[42:38.520 --> 42:43.440]  Hispanics get up from Hispanics talk about freedom and self-defense and family in front
[42:43.440 --> 42:50.160]  of white people but the same story freedom that's what people want no you eat taco you
[42:50.160 --> 43:00.400]  have taco just the arrogance the disdain the talking down to people God Almighty seven

[47:06.480 --> 47:31.800]  you know there's the theory that jill biden hillary clinter space aliens i don't know
[47:31.800 --> 47:37.400]  that's true david hikes right but i know this you get up in front of a group of Hispanics
[47:37.400 --> 47:45.560]  you say you're like tacos these are crazy people these people are out of control all
[47:45.560 --> 47:49.800]  they think is about race i don't even think about somebody about what kind of food they
[47:49.800 --> 47:55.520]  cook i think about what kind of citizens they are but let's let's get to this here's here's
[47:55.520 --> 47:59.800]  jill biden doctor jill biden she was given a degree you're not supposed to question
[47:59.800 --> 48:06.240]  that saying you're like tacos you're so diverse there's so many types of tacos you're not
[48:06.240 --> 48:11.640]  scientists you're not farmers you're not teachers you're not parents you're not americans you're
[48:11.640 --> 48:18.640]  tacos because she thinks of what could she get from you oh Hispanics give me tacos you
[48:18.640 --> 48:24.040]  don't walk into some diner and eat american food and go well i like these americans they
[48:24.040 --> 48:31.320]  just gave me fried eggs and ham again it gets into their mindset these people are disconnected
[48:31.320 --> 48:40.640]  from everything here she is but we can't get those things on our own raul helped build
[48:40.640 --> 48:49.080]  this organization with the understanding that the diversity of this community as distinct
[48:49.080 --> 48:57.080]  as the bogadas of the broncs as beautiful as the blossoms of miami and as unique as the
[48:57.080 --> 49:10.920]  breakfast tacos here in san antonio is your strength your breakfast tacos guess the germans
[49:10.920 --> 49:18.760]  are known for space travel and she tells Hispanics are known for tacos that's her mindset
[49:18.760 --> 49:32.000]  so here's cnn can't believe how low biden's ratings are 94% of under 30 30 and below hating
[49:32.000 --> 49:35.640]  and they're making a joke but they're making a joke about themselves because they they put
[49:35.640 --> 49:45.840]  him in they run him they're part of the same absorbed controlled system that hotel was
[49:45.840 --> 49:52.720]  talking about earlier and so the only lower poll ratings are mainstream medium so they're
[49:52.720 --> 49:58.360]  laughing at themselves here it is nearly two-thirds of democratic primary voters want a different
[49:58.360 --> 50:04.240]  nominee two-thirds if you break it down by age 94% of democratic primary voters under
[50:04.240 --> 50:14.960]  the age of 30 94% say they don't want biden that is a stunning number yes he swept his
[50:14.960 --> 50:21.200]  grandchildren but other than that i mean like who uh i mean 94% don't want him who are damn
[50:21.200 --> 50:29.760]  it again 94% democrats under the age of 30 yeah but he won the election by nine million
[50:29.760 --> 50:41.160]  votes and when i take a crap gold bars come out no they stole the election and they suppressed
[50:41.160 --> 50:49.080]  all the resistance to it that spoke up against it and then they go to hispanic crowds and
[50:49.080 --> 50:55.360]  talk about tacos not about their children not about their right to a future not about
[50:55.360 --> 51:01.120]  their second amendment not about their borders not about their currency not about anything
[51:01.120 --> 51:12.480]  but tacos you're like who who could come up with that these people but you know what's
[51:12.480 --> 51:18.520]  pathetic we've let them do this to us and so i look down on myself for allowing something
[51:18.520 --> 51:23.760]  like this imagine if i walked up to one of our hispanic crew like half the folks work
[51:23.760 --> 51:30.720]  here at hispanic and i said hey are you really you really make good tacos it's patronizing
[51:30.720 --> 51:37.160]  it's ridiculous it's stupid it's like telling somebody that lives in the midwest that's
[51:37.160 --> 51:46.200]  a white person boy you guys you know you're really good at growing corn remember remember
[51:46.200 --> 51:49.440]  what bloomberg said two years ago he said no these idiot farmers anybody can put a seed
[51:49.440 --> 51:53.000]  in the ground make it grow really you think it's just that easy huh you know how hard
[51:53.000 --> 51:58.720]  it is anybody's ever bought me plants at your house how hard it is to keep my life how about
[51:58.720 --> 52:02.560]  keeping the pest off of it how about working your ass off how about doing all the work
[52:02.560 --> 52:09.000]  but they just say you farmers it's easy you know you Mexicans you just make tacos that's
[52:09.000 --> 52:19.480]  what Mexicans do they don't have hopes and dreams they just make tacos for us these
[52:19.480 --> 52:28.280]  are sick people and they're pedophiles and we've got the numbers cnn data analyst has
[52:28.280 --> 52:34.040]  some bad news for democrats about january 6 hearings a few hundred thousand people total
[52:34.040 --> 52:38.800]  watch these things on every network and people look at they go well why didn't they burn
[52:38.800 --> 52:42.640]  the whole thing down and i'm not calling for that i'm just saying people like well string

[52:48.680 --> 52:53.520]  average person no matter black white hispanic old younger like well why do we give medals
[52:53.520 --> 53:00.000]  to those people that crapped on Pelosi's desk and they just keep doing it and calling it
[53:00.000 --> 53:05.200]  the most violent thing on earth worse than pearl harbor worse than 911 these are crazy
[53:05.200 --> 53:10.360]  people who've been lying so long they think they can tell any lie they want and we're
[53:10.360 --> 53:17.520]  just gonna buy it and we have these documents leak docs fbi infiltrated proud boys on january
[53:17.520 --> 53:22.120]  6 group did not plan insurrection they had recordings of it all i love the shows like
[53:22.120 --> 53:28.960]  we know there was a secret meeting with mark meadows and alex jones and roger stone and
[53:28.960 --> 53:36.080]  steve bannon and general flinn at the wellard never happened never saw those people wish
[53:36.080 --> 53:41.480]  they'd had me on their shows other than flinn roger stone wants to physically attack steve
[53:41.480 --> 53:47.440]  bannon but they've got steve bannon and roger stone in a meeting planning an attack they had
[53:47.440 --> 53:52.840]  feds all over the place they all know we walked into that trap with the left provocaturing
[53:52.840 --> 54:01.840]  those events but they run these headlines like the secret meeting at the wellard hotel
[54:01.840 --> 54:09.920]  and they're all about to go down right now but nobody's watching nobody's listening and
[54:09.920 --> 54:14.960]  of course they had feds crawling all over it and army special operations because our
[54:14.960 --> 54:20.080]  guys are forming former army special operations and they're like hey bro what's going on what
[54:20.080 --> 54:29.840]  are you doing here they had their spies everywhere and they can't indict us because we were not
[54:29.840 --> 54:38.200]  planning anything but it doesn't matter the left continues to pretend that this is all

[1:00:17.520 --> 1:00:27.040]  this live tuesday july 12 20 22 transmission so that's all coming up today we've got so
[1:00:27.040 --> 1:00:32.320]  much news and information to be covering i'm tired about this broadcast today i'm very
[1:00:32.320 --> 1:00:37.760]  thankful the crew all of us is going to be covered today and again as i told you start
[1:00:37.760 --> 1:00:41.360]  on the next segment i'm going to give them up and we're going to take your phone calls
[1:00:41.360 --> 1:00:46.280]  on the great reset on the global awakening and on hunter bightons iphone and how they
[1:00:46.280 --> 1:00:51.120]  are desperately spinning out of control trying to suppress that we've also got the world
[1:00:51.120 --> 1:00:55.760]  lot economic collapse latest numbers on that and we have this will you will eat the bugs
[1:00:55.760 --> 1:01:02.520]  you will love it clip coming up but first here's this report birth rates are declining
[1:01:02.520 --> 1:01:08.160]  that's true in this country as well it's true in europe the populations are literally disappearing
[1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:13.040]  most governments ignore this trend or instead import new citizens from the rest of the world
[1:01:13.040 --> 1:01:18.240]  but we don't like that approach because we would not like to after our personal life
[1:01:18.240 --> 1:01:21.360]  we would not like to leave this country to the migrants we would like to leave it to
[1:01:21.360 --> 1:01:26.480]  grandchildren virtually alone among western countries hungary has addressed the problem
[1:01:26.480 --> 1:01:31.840]  directly with a family policy how to convince hungarians to get married and have children
[1:01:32.720 --> 1:01:37.760]  that's a major concern of the orban government they want to conserve hungarian sovereignty
[1:01:37.760 --> 1:01:43.040]  and family policy is a big part of that they know that there will be no hungary in the future if
[1:01:43.040 --> 1:01:48.400]  we're not creating hungarians right now the plan to increase the hungarian birth rate is simple
[1:01:48.400 --> 1:01:53.840]  reward people who'd like to have children so if we have a young couple and they want to raise
[1:01:53.840 --> 1:01:59.760]  children together they can get a credit without an interest rate it's quite a large amount of money
[1:01:59.760 --> 1:02:05.280]  it's 10 million forints which means like 30 000 us dollars you don't have to pay it back if you
[1:02:05.280 --> 1:02:10.880]  will have three children and they are willing to violate free market dogmas for the sake of
[1:02:10.880 --> 1:02:19.280]  defending the country so we totally write up your student loan if you have three children we have a
[1:02:19.280 --> 1:02:25.360]  full exemption lifelong from personal income tax paying for mothers with at least four children
[1:02:25.360 --> 1:02:32.800]  you also get a housing subsidy if you want to buy a car a seven seater if you have three children
[1:02:32.800 --> 1:02:41.360]  or the third child is on the way then you're eligible for this support
[1:02:45.360 --> 1:02:51.360]  and countries to shut down their most productive sectors in the name of climate change and equity
[1:02:52.160 --> 1:02:59.200]  so because of esg germany is now rationing electricity because of esg farmers are in revolt
[1:02:59.200 --> 1:03:05.760]  in the netherlands but the saddest victim of esg is Sri Lanka once a prosperous country right off
[1:03:05.760 --> 1:03:10.480]  the southern coast of india shrunk has collapsed inflation is over 50 percent food prices are up
[1:03:10.480 --> 1:03:16.160]  more than 80 percent this week shrunk as president and prime minister to flee the country citizens
[1:03:16.160 --> 1:03:21.360]  stormed their residences went through their sock drawers and swim in their swimming pools now it was
[1:03:21.360 --> 1:03:25.360]  just a few years ago that the world economic forum published an article entitled and we're quoting
[1:03:25.360 --> 1:03:31.520]  this is how we will make Sri Lanka rich by 2025 weirdly if you search that article online tonight
[1:03:32.160 --> 1:03:37.040]  it's been deleted oh weird covering their tracks but not very well so how this happened well in
[1:03:37.040 --> 1:03:43.760]  april of 2021 Sri Lanka's leaders banned chemical fertilizers now 90 percent of the country's farms
[1:03:43.760 --> 1:03:51.040]  used chemical fertilizers so what happened next a third of Sri Lanka's farms shut down completely
[1:03:51.040 --> 1:03:56.240]  now what happens when farms shut down hmm quiz well people starve this is what the
[1:03:56.240 --> 1:04:22.240]  largest city in Sri Lanka colombo looked like this week
[1:04:26.400 --> 1:04:44.800]  that's what the green new deal looks like in Sri Lanka now we know what you're thinking oh so
[1:04:45.440 --> 1:04:50.080]  pampered lifestyle liberals in the united states just destroyed something else they did this Sri
[1:04:50.080 --> 1:04:54.400]  Lanka what busing did to american education just absolutely wrecked it and then walked away like
[1:04:54.400 --> 1:05:00.960]  it never happened so that's the downside people's lives were destroyed several years ago i approached

[1:06:27.760 --> 1:06:33.360]  time callers on the great reset on hunter biden's iphone which they now admit it's real instead
[1:06:33.360 --> 1:06:38.560]  of denying it last time they failed to suppress the laptop they failed now instantly it shows how
[1:06:38.560 --> 1:06:43.360]  we keep resisting we get stronger they get weaker but i want to hear a little promo clip
[1:06:43.360 --> 1:06:52.880]  but a good fellow friend podcaster sent me this morning bill gates super villain origin story
[1:06:53.440 --> 1:07:01.120]  here it is state three as a video tape demonstration of bill gates if he didn't like what you said he
[1:07:01.120 --> 1:07:06.080]  would you know he was known for responding with the words well that's the stupidest thing i've ever
[1:07:06.080 --> 1:07:13.520]  heard that's ridiculous i'm not using this thing no no no somebody's confused somebody's just not
[1:07:13.520 --> 1:07:19.680]  thinking there's no way you guys never understood you never understood the first thing about this
[1:07:21.040 --> 1:07:28.720]  he's a multi-dimensional individual he has great depth in so many different areas hi kids
[1:07:28.720 --> 1:07:36.480]  you had a number of meetings with jeffrey epstein well he's dead so uh you know in general you
[1:07:36.480 --> 1:07:43.600]  always have to be careful uh and you know the today we're announcing a commitment
[1:07:43.600 --> 1:07:51.680]  over this next decade which we think of as a decade of vaccines the vaccine is is critical
[1:07:51.680 --> 1:07:57.440]  because until you have that things aren't really going to be normal and it won't be normal until we
[1:07:57.440 --> 1:08:07.040]  get a an amazing vaccine to the entire world and for all 193 member states you must make vaccines
[1:08:07.040 --> 1:08:12.480]  a high priority in your health systems to ensure that all your children have access
[1:08:12.480 --> 1:08:19.520]  to existing vaccines now and to the new vaccines that have recently become available and keeping
[1:08:19.520 --> 1:08:26.000]  children alive would that create more of a population problem that we're pledging an
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:37.840]  additional billion dollars
[1:08:40.960 --> 1:08:47.840]  thank you
[1:08:47.840 --> 1:08:56.800]  all right thank you
[1:08:56.800 --> 1:09:02.480]  it's not every day we give away a billion dollars my dad was uh he had a plant parent
[1:09:02.480 --> 1:09:09.200]  out alive with statistics by daryl huff it's a quick read it's got a lot of good examples in it
[1:09:09.200 --> 1:09:19.760]  eye and the face all right so i'm gonna open the phones up the first time college to talk
[1:09:19.760 --> 1:09:25.920]  about the global rebellion against the great reset and hunter biden's iphone which they now admit
[1:09:25.920 --> 1:09:32.640]  it's real they tried to deny it two years ago with the laptop much of it's the same stuff and now it's
[1:09:32.640 --> 1:09:38.800]  all there and they failed see it isn't working this time to say it's not real they're losing
[1:09:38.800 --> 1:09:42.640]  we're winning
[1:09:44.400 --> 1:09:47.280]  i want to play this clip right now and i'll give the number out here in a moment
[1:09:49.120 --> 1:09:50.400]  brim the phones up right now
[1:09:52.720 --> 1:09:57.280]  eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine eight seven seven seven eight nine
[1:09:57.280 --> 1:10:02.960]  two five three nine eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine eight seven seven seven
[1:10:02.960 --> 1:10:14.260]  it ain't nine hours. These people need you to bow down to them. They need you to not
[1:10:14.260 --> 1:10:19.820]  recognize they're evil. They need you to go along with them. And I've done this thousands
[1:10:19.820 --> 1:10:24.620]  of times. I played the corporate medium and I do it every day. And I said on the Sunday
[1:10:24.620 --> 1:10:34.800]  show I was doing it. But they can't help themselves. I said on air. This is archetypal. This is
[1:10:34.800 --> 1:10:44.040]  satire. This is illustrative. But if we could defeat the New World Order by me simply cutting
[1:10:44.040 --> 1:10:51.760]  a finger off live on air, how dramatic with blood spewing, I would do it to show the listeners
[1:10:51.760 --> 1:10:55.920]  and viewers how much I appreciate them in this fight. Because if I'm willing to give up my
[1:10:55.920 --> 1:11:02.800]  body in the fight against these people, why would I not, like a Japanese man joining the
[1:11:02.800 --> 1:11:12.880]  mafia, cut my pinky off? And so ABC News, NBC News, CNN, Mediaite, all of them ran the story
[1:11:12.880 --> 1:11:19.580]  last night today. It's in thousands of publications. Alex Jones is mentally ill and he threatened
[1:11:19.580 --> 1:11:28.040]  to cut his finger off on his show. Though I said, this is an example. It's archetypal.
[1:11:28.040 --> 1:11:33.960]  It shows how committed I am. And I went on to say, we cut the balls off in the UK and
[1:11:33.960 --> 1:11:39.280]  Europe and the US and Canada, New Zealand, Australia of eight year olds because the government
[1:11:39.280 --> 1:11:44.680]  convinces them they're a girl. So a little boy has their penis cut off. So if I said
[1:11:44.680 --> 1:11:51.280]  on air, I'm going to cut my penis off. I'm going to get up right now. I'm going to cut
[1:11:51.280 --> 1:12:02.440]  my penis off. That would be stunning and brave. But I say I'll cut my finger off to show you
[1:12:02.440 --> 1:12:10.000]  how much I appreciate you. And they flip out. See how that works? Oh, cutting a child's
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:16.160]  penis and their testicles off, destroying their fertility, destroying their genetic future.
[1:12:16.160 --> 1:12:22.200]  That's liberal. That's trendy. But Jones says, as an example, if I could cut my finger off
[1:12:22.200 --> 1:12:27.200]  to beat this, I'd do it. Of course I would in a second. God, I'm tempted to do it right
[1:12:27.200 --> 1:12:32.880]  now just to make a point. I mean, you know, I'll do it, right? But not because I want
[1:12:32.880 --> 1:12:37.880]  to lose a finger because I want to gain my body and my children and the future. I'm ready
[1:12:37.880 --> 1:12:44.400]  to die physically to beat these people. Of course I'll cut a finger off. And if the transaction
[1:12:44.400 --> 1:12:51.680]  was clear, I'd do it. But that's how sick these people are. They take a clip out of
[1:12:51.680 --> 1:12:56.800]  context and go, Jones is insane. He's on air. He's going to sell farm. He's trying to cut
[1:12:56.800 --> 1:13:01.800]  his finger off and they cut all I set out explaining it. And they'll do it again right
[1:13:01.800 --> 1:13:06.880]  now. But it doesn't matter because they're not the only people on air you're tuning in.
[1:13:06.880 --> 1:13:13.560]  You're spreading the word. You're exposing them. And that's what I'm saying. I don't
[1:13:13.560 --> 1:13:21.480]  want to sell farm. But if I could sell farm to stop these people, I'd do it. The truth
[1:13:21.480 --> 1:13:25.200]  is they're obsessed with this because they're so farming to hurt themselves and all of us
[1:13:25.200 --> 1:13:31.440]  at the same time. But what are we willing to do to stop them? We need to sell farm. We
[1:13:31.440 --> 1:13:39.360]  just got to start caring and being involved and being informed. So here's the edited clip
[1:13:39.360 --> 1:13:44.320]  they played that will go to your phone calls. But that's what this is all about. What are
[1:13:44.320 --> 1:13:47.720]  you going to give up? What are you going to put in the line? Are you going to submit or
[1:13:47.720 --> 1:13:53.400]  are you going to roll over? It's that simple. And remember, we explained all this before
[1:13:53.400 --> 1:13:59.040]  they showed this clip out of context to demonize people saying I'll cut my finger off for freedom.
[1:13:59.040 --> 1:14:04.120]  Well, my God, they teach our little boys to cut their penises off. It's liberal and loving.
[1:14:04.120 --> 1:14:11.160]  Here it is. The lead got indirect me so that I can continue this operation because we have
[1:14:11.160 --> 1:14:19.040]  been given nothing but success, nothing but victory. It has been spectacular. And you,
[1:14:19.040 --> 1:14:27.680]  the viewers and listeners, you did this. And that's why when I salute you, I'm not into
[1:14:27.680 --> 1:14:35.840]  self-harming, but I just are typally want to take this dagger and just cut a finger off
[1:14:35.840 --> 1:14:40.280]  right on there to show you how much I appreciate you and what you've done. Let's give it up
[1:14:40.280 --> 1:14:51.320]  a finger to make these people's nothing. You have changed the world. You have stood up
[1:14:51.320 --> 1:14:59.280]  against evil. You have turned the tide and I salute you and I thank you and you've got
[1:14:59.280 --> 1:15:06.520]  that from the very bottom of my heart. You've got my full commitment because you need to
[1:15:06.520 --> 1:15:09.320]  know in the universe they're real people. You need to know in the universe there's people
[1:15:09.320 --> 1:15:14.440]  like you who aren't evil, who don't serve Satan. That's why they all day say I'm an actor,
[1:15:14.440 --> 1:15:20.120]  all day say I'm a fake, all day say I'm a fraud with no evidence because they know I didn't
[1:15:20.120 --> 1:15:27.440]  sell out to them. They know you didn't sell out. You didn't sell out. So it's all over
[1:15:27.440 --> 1:15:32.400]  the news. Daily Mail, Associated Press, it's everywhere. Jones Threads it. Well, if I'd
[1:15:32.400 --> 1:15:37.900]  have said, how about I cut my penis off? Then it'd be like, oh my God, this is totally reasonable.
[1:15:37.900 --> 1:15:44.040]  But it's finger. Oh, oh, that's the, oh my God, this man's insane. But it was his penis
[1:15:44.040 --> 1:15:49.320]  or his child's testicles. Well, then we're for it. So you can't have it both ways. Little
[1:15:49.320 --> 1:15:54.200]  children's balls and penis is being cut off is good. Me cutting the finger off is bad.
[1:15:54.200 --> 1:16:02.000]  Which way is it? Seven months ago in December of 2021, we launched the first and the three
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:07.880]  coin founding member series, George Washington slaying the dragon. Then we launched the Tree
[1:16:07.880 --> 1:16:12.720]  of Liberty coin and finally the second amendment, come and take it, Molan Lobby coin. There
[1:16:12.720 --> 1:16:22.160]  are only 75 coins left in the three-point series exclusively right now at 1776point.com.
[1:16:22.160 --> 1:16:28.280]  And for the final 75 people to become founding members for this big project we're launching
[1:16:28.280 --> 1:16:33.760]  in the near future, you'll also get a personal signed piece of art I made of the sheepdog
[1:16:33.760 --> 1:16:38.520]  chasing the wolf and a personal message. It's your last chance to get all three coins
[1:16:38.520 --> 1:16:46.560]  at 1776point.com. This is history happening now. Info workstation support is changing
[1:16:46.560 --> 1:16:57.720]  the world and this is the final 75 three-point set exclusively available at 1776point.com.
[1:16:57.720 --> 1:17:04.720]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here. And that's
[1:17:04.720 --> 1:17:09.280]  what people recognize and resonate with and as Ward said, you're not going to find a
[1:17:09.280 --> 1:17:13.600]  better place for information. You might not agree with everything. You might not agree
[1:17:13.600 --> 1:17:18.040]  with all our perspectives but we cover all the information. And there's nowhere else
[1:17:18.040 --> 1:17:22.040]  really that does it like we do here. Thank you for that Ward. Infowarstore.com by the
[1:17:22.040 --> 1:17:26.680]  way, the products he mentions, infowarstore.com is where to get them folks and we do have
[1:17:26.680 --> 1:17:31.000]  the best supplements. I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage and our
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:37.600]  information, we do the best with our supplements as well. I mean, look at the hair and beard
[1:17:37.600 --> 1:17:43.080]  support formula. Folks, this is a joke. I mean, we're giving this thing away at 75% off.
[1:17:43.080 --> 1:17:47.040]  By the way, it works for me and in case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula
[1:17:47.040 --> 1:17:54.760]  is working for me. Quite well, I might add. Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and
[1:17:54.760 --> 1:17:59.920]  beard support for men. I go and see him quite often now. We brought the game changing product
[1:17:59.920 --> 1:18:04.320]  previously only available to major oil companies around the world to the civilian market two
[1:18:04.320 --> 1:18:10.640]  years ago, the bio pros for septic tanks for porta potties for RVs for your drains, your
[1:18:10.640 --> 1:18:15.760]  boats, it goes on and on. It'll eat the oil off of your driveway if you just add water.
[1:18:15.760 --> 1:18:21.600]  But it's been so successful now. We're selling it to major RV parks, pig farms, you name
[1:18:21.600 --> 1:18:28.160]  it, because this stuff will eat anything that is organic. And it's exclusively available
[1:18:28.160 --> 1:18:35.880]  at the bio pros.com. And now info or store.com. We sold out of this for almost a year. We've
[1:18:35.880 --> 1:18:41.800]  made a major purchase and it is now in stock for whatever your need is at info or store.com.
[1:18:41.800 --> 1:18:47.160]  You'll also find instructional videos and more information at info or store.com or the
[1:18:47.160 --> 1:18:53.800]  bio pros.com made America powered by God's great creation. It is amazing and it funds
[1:18:53.800 --> 1:19:01.080]  the info war. Look at that. Everybody else is just like yellow or clear. That's because
[1:19:01.080 --> 1:19:07.680]  it's been denatured. It's been worked out. We didn't do that. You think I would metaphysically
[1:19:07.680 --> 1:19:12.280]  tell you something. This is the very best I can get. I'd rather go to hell and do that.
[1:19:12.280 --> 1:19:18.160]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product because
[1:19:18.160 --> 1:19:24.640]  I want that good will. What I do to you, I do to myself. Don't you get the big secret?
[1:19:24.640 --> 1:19:30.000]  You ever seen fish oil look like that? No, you never seen that, have you? And this little
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:45.160]  jewel right here is solid liquid consciousness. Look it up. Find out how even the FDA and
[1:19:45.160 --> 1:19:49.960]  the government admits fish oil is incredible. The number one thing anybody can do for themselves
[1:19:49.960 --> 1:19:54.920]  is take good fish oil or krill oil. Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products
[1:19:54.920 --> 1:20:21.280]  and four store.com. Here we are in the year 2022, battling the globalist and we're taking
[1:20:21.280 --> 1:20:32.800]  your phone calls. Let's go to Chicago and talk to Dino. Dino, you're on the air first
[1:20:32.800 --> 1:20:38.760]  caller of the day. Awesome. Thank you very much for taking my call. You guys are soldiers
[1:20:38.760 --> 1:20:43.720]  of God, so God bless you. I just want to make some quick points. The BRICS, I saw a video
[1:20:43.720 --> 1:20:49.080]  recently that Russia, China, and possibly Iran might introduce a new currency to combat
[1:20:49.080 --> 1:20:54.160]  the US dollar, so that'll deflate the value of the dollar or hyperinflate it tremendously.
[1:20:54.160 --> 1:20:59.200]  And then out in California, me being a trucker, there's a law called AB5 where it basically
[1:20:59.200 --> 1:21:05.640]  eliminated 1099 contractors. So you're going to see supply chain issues and disruptions
[1:21:05.640 --> 1:21:11.720]  on the West Coast tremendously. I mean, the farmers need diesel fuel. The ports need to
[1:21:11.720 --> 1:21:17.080]  be picked up and delivered over there. Things need to be put on the train. A lot of the
[1:21:17.080 --> 1:21:24.400]  food's produced in California. So you're going to see, along with the fact that 80 plus factories
[1:21:24.400 --> 1:21:28.600]  have been destroyed, I mean, things are going to start looking kind of bad pretty soon.
[1:21:28.600 --> 1:21:34.040]  So now you have issues with that and then UPS and I guess maybe another carrier, SIA,
[1:21:34.040 --> 1:21:39.200]  might stop shipping uppers or firearm parts. So people that want to get certain things
[1:21:39.200 --> 1:21:43.600]  that might see supply chain disruptions and then the dollar, when people thought because
[1:21:43.600 --> 1:21:47.280]  of the housing crisis, might go soft and might go through the roof.
[1:21:47.280 --> 1:21:53.560]  No, you're right. The democracy is doing a stress test to see what the AI can get away
[1:21:53.560 --> 1:21:58.560]  with. But as long as we expose the technocrats are doing it, they'll get the blame. They
[1:21:58.560 --> 1:22:03.240]  won't feel safe. They won't be sheltered. They'll back down. That's the key. Thank you
[1:22:03.240 --> 1:22:07.640]  so much, Dino. Rob in Mississippi, you're on the air. Welcome.
[1:22:07.640 --> 1:22:14.600]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call. That caller, he just nailed it. So I'm just going
[1:22:14.600 --> 1:22:20.600]  to plug. I'm 54 years old. I had a life of working around animals and logging. Scars
[1:22:20.600 --> 1:22:26.840]  all over my arms, sunspots all over my arms. You plug a caller named Granny Durei to talk
[1:22:26.840 --> 1:22:33.920]  about her sunspots disappearing 100% true. I've been taking X2 since the lockdown. I've
[1:22:33.920 --> 1:22:41.320]  recently ordered about a month or two ago, the four pack. Alex, give us a seven pack.
[1:22:41.320 --> 1:22:48.800]  Advertise it to people mostly over 50. Do the four, but also add bodies, krill oil and
[1:22:48.800 --> 1:22:54.760]  brain force ultra. Give us a seven pack. And people, if you do not have X2, if you do not
[1:22:54.760 --> 1:23:00.520]  have ultra 12 and vitamin mineral fusion, when you can get it, you get something wrong.
[1:23:00.520 --> 1:23:05.240]  You have got to get this stuff. It's incredible. Dr. Root told me 10 years ago, when you take
[1:23:05.240 --> 1:23:09.760]  this pure deep earth eye nine, I had sunspots, he goes, they'll go away. They went away in
[1:23:09.760 --> 1:23:17.520]  like a month. It is incredible what pure eye nine does. My shoulders were covered. They're
[1:23:17.520 --> 1:23:23.640]  almost gone. And one other thing, I worked from 4am to noon now. And that's not when
[1:23:23.640 --> 1:23:32.120]  our brain is at its most active is at 4am, 3am, 30 minutes after taking this four pack.
[1:23:32.120 --> 1:23:36.480]  You are a lot of weight with no jitters. You are a lot of weight. You're thinking you're
[1:23:36.480 --> 1:23:43.520]  going through your daily routine. You feel good. Your body doesn't hurt. I'm just give
[1:23:43.520 --> 1:23:50.420]  us a seven pack, Alex, please. Brother, all I know is the UN is obsessed with bombarding
[1:23:50.420 --> 1:23:55.400]  us with bad halogens, chlorine, fluoride bromine, clean iodine is the key, but so much iodine
[1:23:55.400 --> 1:24:01.040]  is bound to other elements to absorb it. This iodine does it. It's X2. Everybody should
[1:24:01.040 --> 1:24:04.160]  get it. It should be the one product we have because everybody should have it. We fund
[1:24:04.160 --> 1:24:08.440]  the whole operation in fullwarstore.com. Thank you so much, sir.
[1:24:08.440 --> 1:24:13.920]  All right. Hernando. Let's talk to Hernando in South Carolina. You're on the here. Go
[1:24:13.920 --> 1:24:18.920]  ahead, Hernando. Hey, it's actually Fernando, but that's okay. Sorry, they put Hernando.
[1:24:18.920 --> 1:24:23.320]  You're on the here. Go ahead. Hey, that's all right. So really quickly, I know the globalists
[1:24:23.320 --> 1:24:27.400]  there in a corner, but aren't they just going to double down? And then, you know, in fact,
[1:24:27.400 --> 1:24:33.400]  they're still pushing the kill shot and stuff like that. You know, I'm worried that they're
[1:24:33.400 --> 1:24:39.080]  just going to, like you said, probably just assassinate Biden and blame us. Put them in
[1:24:39.080 --> 1:24:44.200]  camps and stuff. No, I hear you. They're destabilizing things. They're collapsing things and Biden's
[1:24:44.200 --> 1:24:49.040]  a puppet. We're the best job we can, but you're absolutely right. Yeah. And then the other
[1:24:49.040 --> 1:24:53.360]  thing is, I know a lot of the younger people, uh, I'll put a young guy, I'm 25, but a lot
[1:24:53.360 --> 1:24:57.720]  of people, you know, early college, especially they just don't care. They don't care what
[1:24:57.720 --> 1:25:01.720]  goes on. They just want to live their lives. And it's like, I'm wearing the shirt, the
[1:25:01.720 --> 1:25:06.760]  Alex Jones shirt. No, I'm sorry. And, uh, you know, it's usually the older people that
[1:25:06.760 --> 1:25:11.560]  respond. So I was thinking maybe we should like invest in some kind of like megaphone
[1:25:11.560 --> 1:25:17.520]  live video or Patriots, you know, just blast highlights of infowars clips out in public.
[1:25:17.520 --> 1:25:22.200]  We're right. In some areas, the young people are awake. In some areas it's the older folks,
[1:25:22.200 --> 1:25:27.720]  but the younger people have been taught to be jellyfish, to not care, to only care about
[1:25:27.720 --> 1:25:31.120]  themselves. They don't connect to others and they're in for a rude awakening. Thank you
[1:25:31.120 --> 1:25:35.920]  so much, Fernando. Sorry about your name wrong. Josh in Indiana, you're on the air. Go ahead,
[1:25:35.920 --> 1:25:43.320]  Josh. Um, first of all, thank you for taking my call. It's a real honor to be on the show,
[1:25:43.320 --> 1:25:50.520]  but what I really wanted to talk about was close Schwab and how he is making us his
[1:25:50.520 --> 1:25:59.160]  puppet and his little get mind game of him. And I'm just not going to stand for that.
[1:25:59.160 --> 1:26:08.120]  I agree, Josh. How old are you? I'm an 11 year old info warrior. Well, that's beautiful,
[1:26:08.120 --> 1:26:11.440]  Josh. How did you find the show? And what do you want to say to millions of people right
[1:26:11.440 --> 1:26:19.280]  now? Um, I found it because my dad watches it and I just find it really interesting.
[1:26:19.280 --> 1:26:27.920]  And I just find and I find cause Schwab very, I don't even know, but I just really wanted
[1:26:27.920 --> 1:26:35.000]  to get that out there that close Schwab is making up, making us his puppets and his tiny
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:40.920]  little mind game. He is. And the minute we wake up to his criminal activity, it's game
[1:26:40.920 --> 1:26:45.360]  over for close Schwab and the new world order. Josh, you got a great dad. You got a great
[1:26:45.360 --> 1:26:50.200]  family and we love you being on board, brother. Just spread the word. Human intelligence will
[1:26:50.200 --> 1:26:55.920]  overpower the AI. We're going to win together. Anything else, Josh? Uh, that's about it.
[1:26:55.920 --> 1:26:59.400]  Thank you for letting me be on the show. Josh, thank you for calling. Let's talk to a caller
[1:26:59.400 --> 1:27:04.880]  in California. Let's talk to Sean. Sean, you're on the air. More now. Let's hope you're doing
[1:27:04.880 --> 1:27:11.080]  well. I'm fighting our brother. I'm doing damn well. Awesome. Uh, real quick, I'm going
[1:27:11.080 --> 1:27:16.120]  to relate something here. This stuff with a bite and, uh, put it released reminds me
[1:27:16.120 --> 1:27:20.600]  back when we had the Lindsay scandal. Republicans had enough to get rid of Clinton with white
[1:27:20.600 --> 1:27:25.900]  water, but it was sex that sells and got the public behind getting rid of Clinton and impeaching
[1:27:25.900 --> 1:27:31.000]  him. So I'm seeing history repeating itself here where now we got a big sex scandal and
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:35.280]  it's, you know, worse than a sex scandal, obviously, but that might be the impetus for
[1:27:35.280 --> 1:27:40.040]  the Republicans to finally follow your advice and impeach Joe Biden. And I wanted to let
[1:27:40.040 --> 1:27:45.480]  you know, uh, in smoke and mirrors and circuses, we got stuff going on with those Georgia
[1:27:45.480 --> 1:27:50.280]  guide stones. Still, uh, the Elberton granite association vice president, Chris Kuboff is
[1:27:50.280 --> 1:27:54.400]  saying they're going to rebuild them. Elberton's mayor, Daniel Graves can't make up a fun
[1:27:54.400 --> 1:27:58.920]  your name. He's talking about how good it was for the community and their local district
[1:27:58.920 --> 1:28:03.120]  attorney part white once the prosecutor's point of years claiming it's an assault on
[1:28:03.120 --> 1:28:04.120]  our community.
[1:28:04.120 --> 1:28:08.680]  Well, it's going to be terrible when it's blown up again. Yeah. The governing authority
[1:28:08.680 --> 1:28:13.520]  of Elberton counties who owns that land, that county to get together and tell them, do not
[1:28:13.520 --> 1:28:18.280]  rebuild that. That's on those people, but the less all about pulling down monuments.
[1:28:18.280 --> 1:28:22.080]  What happens when we start doing it? I hear you and I appreciate your call. All right.
[1:28:22.080 --> 1:28:25.480]  He just took like six, seven calls in one segment. We're going to come back and we're
[1:28:25.480 --> 1:28:36.280]  going to go to Samuel, Greg, Jay, Julian, Brian, Jason, Mary, Sally and Chris straight
[1:28:36.280 --> 1:28:41.600]  ahead. They can't stand us communicating. They can't stand us coming together. They
[1:28:41.600 --> 1:28:47.400]  can't stand us being on air, but we are in defiance of them. And I salute all listeners
[1:28:47.400 --> 1:28:52.680]  and viewers. We'll be back as the rebellion rolls into high gear.
[1:28:57.560 --> 1:29:03.120]  Several years ago, I approached one of the top companies in the US that supplies the

[1:31:55.200 --> 1:32:01.600]  2000 mules. So when I first started taking survival skill, basically I was 275 pounds
[1:32:01.600 --> 1:32:06.760]  overweight. I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe I was barely holding on to a job.
[1:32:06.760 --> 1:32:10.840]  And I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it. So the first one I got was the original
[1:32:10.840 --> 1:32:15.200]  survival shield the X one and it worked pretty good. And then shortly thereafter you came
[1:32:15.200 --> 1:32:18.680]  out with that. You had, you know, with a deeper source, you know, and I got really excited
[1:32:18.680 --> 1:32:23.720]  about that. So I took it. And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally
[1:32:23.720 --> 1:32:28.880]  like my brain was enlightened, you know, I could think again, I could connect with people
[1:32:28.880 --> 1:32:33.880]  again. And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously
[1:32:33.880 --> 1:32:38.280]  take basically all of your supplements. They're all absolutely amazing supplements. The one
[1:32:38.280 --> 1:32:42.960]  I like recently is knock out literally like if you want to sleep, just take it. It's amazing.
[1:32:42.960 --> 1:32:47.320]  It works. But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean. We have to break free
[1:32:47.320 --> 1:32:51.200]  of the globalist system. And the only way to do that is to take our own health into
[1:32:51.200 --> 1:32:52.200]  our own hands.
[1:32:52.200 --> 1:32:59.640]  I've beautifully said, brother, I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed leading
[1:32:59.640 --> 1:33:13.600]  a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones defending the Republic
[1:33:13.600 --> 1:33:24.560]  from enemies, foreign and domestic. We are taking your calls bam, bam, bam today. And
[1:33:24.560 --> 1:33:28.840]  bless to be on air and defiance of the sensors and the control freaks that have tried to
[1:33:28.840 --> 1:33:36.040]  censor and silence America and the world. We are strong. And their corruption is being
[1:33:36.040 --> 1:33:40.120]  exposed. And they know they're in deep trouble. But the danger is they're going to strike
[1:33:40.120 --> 1:33:46.200]  back hard. We've got to be ready for that. All right, we're taking the calls in order
[1:33:46.200 --> 1:33:51.480]  they are received here. We're going to go to a lot of calls here today. Let's talk to
[1:33:51.480 --> 1:33:54.040]  Samuel in California. Samuel, you're on the air.
[1:33:54.040 --> 1:34:02.720]  I was on Alex. Good brother. Good man. Hey, I just wanted to talk about the IMF, the World
[1:34:02.720 --> 1:34:08.120]  Bank and the central banking system in the world. One of the one of the Rothschild's
[1:34:08.120 --> 1:34:13.960]  mother said, I mean, it was a bunch of them. She said, there would be no wars if my sons
[1:34:13.960 --> 1:34:18.840]  didn't want it. And I think people really need to start realizing that the World Bank,
[1:34:18.840 --> 1:34:24.720]  the IMF, like we wouldn't have wars if they weren't in control and they weren't starting
[1:34:24.720 --> 1:34:29.000]  these wars on purpose. I mean, Russia has a centralized bank. Only three countries left
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:34.000]  in the world don't have centralized banks. And I think people really need to realize
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:40.560]  that this thing is so complex and people don't start realizing that we got to take the power
[1:34:40.560 --> 1:34:46.120]  back for ourselves and not rely on money. And that's what's powerful. And in China,
[1:34:46.120 --> 1:34:50.840]  with bank runs and Sri Lanka, they are attacking the central banks, they know who the enemy
[1:34:50.840 --> 1:34:57.680]  is. Yeah. And I mean, it's so quintessential to our existence that people start realizing
[1:34:57.680 --> 1:35:02.480]  that we don't need their money. And you know, every president that's gone against these
[1:35:02.480 --> 1:35:07.720]  people has ended up dead. So it's time to, you know, it's time for people to realize
[1:35:07.720 --> 1:35:15.480]  that this is such a big thing, major, serious agenda that all they had to do is changes
[1:35:15.480 --> 1:35:19.440]  a one into a zero. And we would have, we would have no money just like they've done in so
[1:35:19.440 --> 1:35:20.440]  many other countries.
[1:35:20.440 --> 1:35:23.440]  Exactly. And with the social credit score, they've got the excuse. It's like they got
[1:35:23.440 --> 1:35:27.480]  away with censorship. Now it's taking your bank account. Beautifully said, Samuel. Thank
[1:35:27.480 --> 1:35:34.480]  you so much. Let's talk to Greg in Virginia. Greg, go ahead. Hey, this is Greg, man. I
[1:35:34.480 --> 1:35:39.200]  listened. It's a pleasure to be up here with you. Love you to death. Love you. Look, I
[1:35:39.200 --> 1:35:42.960]  just want to, you know, I want to plug, you know, the word of God, man. I want to make
[1:35:42.960 --> 1:35:48.520]  sure that, you know, the body of Christ and, you know, the info wars of this world and
[1:35:48.520 --> 1:35:52.840]  the pages of this world are not afraid to fight for what they believe in. Because I'm
[1:35:52.840 --> 1:35:58.280]  the one that's God ordained. I want to read three scriptures from the book of Habakkuk,
[1:35:58.280 --> 1:36:03.800]  chapter two, starting at verse four to verse seven. And I just want to say, you know, I'm
[1:36:03.800 --> 1:36:08.000]  the founder of the real Greg Kelly show and I'm banned everywhere, but this is the word
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:13.760]  that needs to go for the people of God in this hour. Look at the proud verse four. They
[1:36:13.760 --> 1:36:18.680]  trust in themselves and their lives are crooked, but their righteous excuse me, but the righteous
[1:36:18.680 --> 1:36:24.600]  will live by their faithfulness to God. Wealth is treacherous and the arrogant are never
[1:36:24.600 --> 1:36:29.200]  going to rest. They open their mouths as wide as the grave and like death, they are never
[1:36:29.200 --> 1:36:34.520]  satisfied in their greed. They have gathered upon many nations and swallowed many people.
[1:36:34.520 --> 1:36:39.360]  Here we go. But soon their captives will taunt them. We're seeing it happen right now, but
[1:36:39.360 --> 1:36:45.640]  they will mock them saying, what sorrow awaits you these? Now will we get, now will you get
[1:36:45.640 --> 1:36:51.280]  what you deserve? You become rich by extortion and how much longer can this go on? Suddenly
[1:36:51.280 --> 1:36:57.040]  your debtors will take action. They will turn on you and take everything that you have and
[1:36:57.040 --> 1:37:02.000]  they will stand there trembling and helpless because you plunder many nations. And I just
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:06.560]  want to let everybody know we've got to get ready. We're watching this happen all over
[1:37:06.560 --> 1:37:11.880]  the globe and they will not miss America. And if we are afraid and if we are divided,
[1:37:11.880 --> 1:37:16.880]  we will be defeated. Thank you for info wars. Thank you for what you do. And sadly, along
[1:37:16.880 --> 1:37:23.000]  we have got to get ready. I bless you. Yeah, it's here. Thank you, Greg. Jay and Pennsylvania.
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:28.840]  Go ahead. Wow. Thanks for taking my call. Alex, you're a living legend. No, you're a legend.
[1:37:28.840 --> 1:37:34.800]  Go ahead. So I have three new core new terms. I want according to the info war realm for
[1:37:34.800 --> 1:37:40.600]  you. I think you're going to love every one of them. So the first is you genocide, you
[1:37:40.600 --> 1:37:46.600]  genocide. It's a combination of the words eugenics and genocide. It's the best term
[1:37:46.600 --> 1:37:51.440]  in one word to basically explain what we've been living through since 2020. All right.
[1:37:51.440 --> 1:37:57.400]  The next term is global techno fascist state. It's basically what the world new order is.
[1:37:57.400 --> 1:38:02.040]  I found that most of our family members are to kind of program against that word. So the
[1:38:02.040 --> 1:38:06.560]  global techno fascist state simply put is a world government. That's the global, the
[1:38:06.560 --> 1:38:11.160]  techno stands for technocracy, which isn't just a fancy term, be conspiracy theorists
[1:38:11.160 --> 1:38:14.880]  use, but it's an actual form of government that the world elite has an advocating for
[1:38:14.880 --> 1:38:20.560]  for over a hundred years with political parties in Canada and the US. And it basically means
[1:38:20.560 --> 1:38:24.280]  scientific rule by new elite. We're warned of it by Eisenhower. We've been warned of
[1:38:24.280 --> 1:38:27.920]  it by many other people. That's if you want to know what it looks like, you simply have
[1:38:27.920 --> 1:38:32.760]  to watch any of the dystopian nightmare horror movies made in the past generation, hunger
[1:38:32.760 --> 1:38:37.680]  games. It's all coming true. It's all part of their plan on record. Yep. Absolutely.
[1:38:37.680 --> 1:38:43.240]  And the last term is the great reset versus the great Renaissance. And basically the Renaissance,
[1:38:43.240 --> 1:38:47.720]  as we all know, those are huge advancement in human civilization. And it basically came
[1:38:47.720 --> 1:38:53.280]  from advancement in technology, advancement in spiritual exploration and also freedom
[1:38:53.280 --> 1:38:58.800]  from the centralized authorities, mainly church and state. So the combination of that, I think
[1:38:58.800 --> 1:39:02.280]  we actually do have a real chance of, you know, making it through this, but the harvest
[1:39:02.280 --> 1:39:06.400]  is going to be real. Exactly. This is a big time we're in right now. Thank you, Jay. Julian
[1:39:06.400 --> 1:39:14.280]  in Canada, you're on the air. Go ahead. Hi, it's actually Jillian. I'm sorry, I can't
[1:39:14.280 --> 1:39:19.280]  get any names right. Jillian, go ahead. You're on the air. I just want to thank you for taking
[1:39:19.280 --> 1:39:27.280]  my call and I just had two questions. I want to your opinion and your view on which is
[1:39:27.280 --> 1:39:34.280]  Tamera Lynch getting denied bail. And she was one of the leaders of the Freedom Convoy
[1:39:34.280 --> 1:39:38.240]  in Canada. Yeah, they've still got people locked up in soldier confinement for people,
[1:39:38.240 --> 1:39:44.440]  peaceful protest. Canada has turned into North Korea. Yes, it has been. It's more like
[1:39:44.440 --> 1:39:54.280]  China to now instead of Canada. And my other question, and I want your opinion on is that
[1:39:54.280 --> 1:40:02.280]  NYC doing a PSA on what to do during a nuclear attack? You know, I'm glad you raised that.
[1:40:02.280 --> 1:40:07.280]  I'll play that video when we come back. They're just creating total fear. Any way they can
[1:40:07.280 --> 1:40:15.280]  to get you to submit to them. And that was all I would like to ask today. Jillian, I
[1:40:15.280 --> 1:40:20.280]  will answer that question. We come back. Thank you so much. Amazing question. We will get
[1:40:20.280 --> 1:40:26.280]  to that next segment right now. Let's go to another caller, Larry. Is that Larry Pinckney?
[1:40:26.280 --> 1:40:30.280]  I didn't know Larry Pinckney was holding. We'll go to Larry Pinckney. Larry Pinckney,
[1:40:30.280 --> 1:40:33.280]  one of the founding members of the New Black Panther Party, the real folks of the original
[1:40:33.280 --> 1:40:37.280]  Black Panther Party. He's here with us right now. Larry, how are you doing, man?
[1:40:37.280 --> 1:40:43.280]  My brother, I miss you. I love you and I adore and respect you. I'm just calling very briefly
[1:40:43.280 --> 1:40:47.280]  because I know there are millions of... No, no, no. We're not going to be briefly. The
[1:40:47.280 --> 1:40:52.280]  next guest host can wait 15 minutes. If you want to tell us what's coming up, the guest
[1:40:52.280 --> 1:40:56.280]  host, no, I'll push them back sometime. How about we do segment two together for 10 minutes?
[1:40:56.280 --> 1:41:00.280]  Sounds great. Anything you say, my good brother. You know I love you and respect you.
[1:41:00.280 --> 1:41:03.280]  I love you, too. I've been asking. I'm not mad at the producers, but I've been asking
[1:41:03.280 --> 1:41:07.280]  to get you on for a few months. I know you've got a lot going on, but what are you going
[1:41:07.280 --> 1:41:09.280]  to tell us coming up in about 15 minutes?
[1:41:09.280 --> 1:41:16.280]  Well, basically, I want to stress, one, the importance of info wars, Alec. I want to
[1:41:16.280 --> 1:41:21.280]  stress that info wars is not new. It's been around for well over a decade and not just
[1:41:21.280 --> 1:41:27.280]  around, but telling the truth. Tomorrow's news today. All right? The second thing I want
[1:41:27.280 --> 1:41:33.280]  to stress is that we are not powerless. We are very strong and we are getting stronger
[1:41:33.280 --> 1:41:36.280]  every day. Those are the two things I'd like to stress, my brother.
[1:41:36.280 --> 1:41:41.280]  All right. Don't hang up, police sir. We won't cut these callers off. I'll go to break. I'm
[1:41:41.280 --> 1:41:46.280]  going to come back and get to Jeremiah and Brian and Jason and everybody and Mary and
[1:41:46.280 --> 1:41:50.280]  everybody. And then we'll do two segments together. We'll do segment one and segment
[1:41:50.280 --> 1:41:55.280]  two of the next hour. And then I forget who's doing the, there's a whole other hour
[1:41:55.280 --> 1:41:59.280]  coming up. Actually, I actually have, you know, we'll do this. We'll do this. I'm out
[1:41:59.280 --> 1:42:06.280]  of my mind, folks. We have Dr. Sherry Timpinney coming up. So I'm completely all over the
[1:42:06.280 --> 1:42:11.280]  map here. We're going to come back and go to Larry Pinckney, the original, original Black
[1:42:11.280 --> 1:42:15.280]  Panther Party, not the new Black Panther Party that the FBI controls, like they control
[1:42:15.280 --> 1:42:20.280]  the Klan. We'll talk to him for a segment and then we will have Sherry Timpinney on
[1:42:20.280 --> 1:42:24.280]  and then I will continue with everybody else that is patiently holding here on this Tuesday,
[1:42:24.280 --> 1:42:29.280]  July 12th, worldwide broadcast. But I have been trying to get Larry Pinckney on. So I'm
[1:42:29.280 --> 1:42:33.280]  really glad he's here because he was a founding member of the Black Panther Party and got put
[1:42:33.280 --> 1:42:37.280]  in prison for it and has exposed the whole thing and his knowledge is incredible. So
[1:42:37.280 --> 1:42:42.280]  Larry Pinckney is straight ahead, massively censored, not supposed to air from him, but
[1:42:42.280 --> 1:42:45.280]  millions are tuning in right now. You're about to hear from Larry Pinckney. So Larry, we're
[1:42:45.280 --> 1:42:49.280]  back in four minutes. Please stay there. We're going to write to Larry Pinckney, then
[1:42:49.280 --> 1:42:54.280]  Dr. Sherry Timpinney, then all your calls, infoawards.com, tomorrow at noon today. Love Larry
[1:42:54.280 --> 1:43:03.280]  Pinckney calling him. There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right
[1:43:03.280 --> 1:43:09.280]  here. And that's what people recognize and resonate with. And as Ward said, you're not
[1:43:09.280 --> 1:43:13.280]  going to find a better place for information. You might not agree with everything. You might
[1:43:13.280 --> 1:43:18.280]  not agree with all our perspectives, but we cover all the information. And there's no
[1:43:18.280 --> 1:43:24.280]  word else really that does it like we do here. Thank you for that, Ward. Infowarsstore.com,
[1:43:24.280 --> 1:43:27.280]  by the way, the products he mentions, infoawardsstore.com is where to get them, folks. And we do have
[1:43:27.280 --> 1:43:31.280]  the best supplements. I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage and our
[1:43:31.280 --> 1:43:38.280]  information, we do the best with our supplements as well. I mean, look at the hair and beard
[1:43:38.280 --> 1:43:43.280]  support formula, folks, this is a joke. I mean, we're giving this thing away. It's 75%
[1:43:43.280 --> 1:43:47.280]  off. By the way, it works for me. In case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula
[1:43:47.280 --> 1:43:55.280]  is working for me. Quite well, I might add. Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and
[1:43:55.280 --> 1:44:01.280]  beard support for men. I go and see him quite often now. If I had to describe with just
[1:44:01.280 --> 1:44:10.280]  one word, the brainwashing, the mind control, the asleep prince that the general public
[1:44:10.280 --> 1:44:16.280]  is in, the best word would actually be the people are lost. Just like you're lost to
[1:44:16.280 --> 1:44:22.280]  sleep or lost in a bad nightmare. You're in a horror. You get knocked out and you've
[1:44:22.280 --> 1:44:29.280]  lost your bearings because you are totally dizzy and confused. You have a concussion.
[1:44:29.280 --> 1:44:34.280]  And that's what the globalists have done. They have stunned us. They have put us into
[1:44:34.280 --> 1:44:38.280]  a position of not knowing our bearings. And then Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave
[1:44:38.280 --> 1:44:43.280]  speech. He called the great new narrative where he brags how the public is lost, how
[1:44:43.280 --> 1:44:48.280]  the culture in the media has been driven to make sure that people are all alone so they
[1:44:48.280 --> 1:44:52.280]  can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff. That's what the great reset is. They
[1:44:52.280 --> 1:45:17.280]  need darkness to thrive. The light lives.
[1:45:17.280 --> 1:45:23.280]  All these amazing designs at KlausInfoWars.com, except for this fundraiser shirt that is a

[1:47:23.280 --> 1:47:39.280]  Thank God he called in today. So I want his take on where the world is, where he sees this
[1:47:39.280 --> 1:47:46.280]  all going and his message to the people. He's got his own channel on band.video. Larry Pinkney, amazing to have you, my brother.
[1:47:46.280 --> 1:47:50.280]  Thank you so much. What do you want in part to our audience of millions right now?
[1:47:50.280 --> 1:47:59.280]  Well, the first thing I want to say, my good brother, is I love you. I respect you. I adore you. Not only you, but all the crew,
[1:47:59.280 --> 1:48:07.280]  whether it's Owen Schroer or whether it's Darren McBreen, all of the crew at InfoWars, black, white, brown, red, yellow, all of them.
[1:48:07.280 --> 1:48:15.280]  We love you. You are doing a magnificent and most important job. Now, that's the first thing I want to say.
[1:48:15.280 --> 1:48:24.280]  The second thing I want to say is that we are, you've repeatedly said this, Alex, and I want to reiterate it.
[1:48:24.280 --> 1:48:35.280]  We are winning. The, you know, the lane stream, vomit stream media, as I call it, will never admit that we are winning despite the
[1:48:35.280 --> 1:48:47.280]  dismal ratings of CNN and the rest of those despicable clowns. But we are winning, but we must intensify because they will react.
[1:48:47.280 --> 1:48:57.280]  I didn't say respond. They will react. And this is where you, Alex, and all of my brothers and sisters at InfoWars are so important.
[1:48:57.280 --> 1:49:07.280]  We must prepare for that because as every day, every hour, every second passes these elitists and not just the elitists.
[1:49:07.280 --> 1:49:11.280]  I know what you're about to say. They're about to blow up some black churches, aren't they? They're about to false flag.
[1:49:11.280 --> 1:49:22.280]  They're about to do whatever they can, my brother, to divert attention from their wickedness, to divert attention from the despicable, deplorable actions.
[1:49:22.280 --> 1:49:30.280]  It's all about divide and conquer. And we will not allow that. We will simply not allow that.
[1:49:30.280 --> 1:49:35.280]  I totally agree. So Larry, you're a smarter guy than I am with history, but around longer than I am, you're my elder.
[1:49:35.280 --> 1:49:40.280]  What would you call this period in history? I call it the Great Awakening. I mean, it's on everywhere.
[1:49:40.280 --> 1:49:46.280]  It is the Great Awakening. I love that expression. It is the Great Awakening. Forget the Great Reset.
[1:49:46.280 --> 1:49:54.280]  Well, don't forget it. But it really is the Great Awakening. And this is what scares them to death because they know it.
[1:49:54.280 --> 1:50:05.280]  They know our brothers and sisters, be they in Alabama, Mississippi, New York, California, Tennessee, wherever, wherever in this great republic.
[1:50:05.280 --> 1:50:12.280]  And it is a great republic. With all our fallacies, it is a great republic. And we will bring it back.
[1:50:12.280 --> 1:50:19.280]  And we will set our little minor differences aside, and we will succeed.
[1:50:19.280 --> 1:50:24.280]  La Simatushin de Mbilashaka, which means we shall succeed without a doubt.
[1:50:24.280 --> 1:50:31.280]  So where we are today, my brother, where we are today is where they thought we'd never be.
[1:50:31.280 --> 1:50:39.280]  They thought they would wipe you and infowars out. Well, guess what? They were wrong, wrong.
[1:50:39.280 --> 1:50:44.280]  Okay? And we've only, as I keep saying, we've only just begun to fight.
[1:50:44.280 --> 1:50:50.280]  I keep quoting that song that came out back in the day. I'm an old dude back in the 60s by the carpenters.
[1:50:50.280 --> 1:50:57.280]  We've only just begun. Well, we've only just begun to fight. We've only just begun to bring our republic back.
[1:50:57.280 --> 1:51:04.280]  And we're going to do that. And you know what? Alex, you are one of my heroes.
[1:51:04.280 --> 1:51:09.280]  You really are. You really are. Well, I don't give a damn about I'm older than you.
[1:51:09.280 --> 1:51:14.280]  Of course I'm older than you. They're people older than me. But you are one of my heroes.
[1:51:14.280 --> 1:51:21.280]  Well, you're my hero too, brother. But I agree with you. We were winning, but we should be ready for whatever nastyness these people are about to pull.
[1:51:21.280 --> 1:51:27.280]  That's right. That's right. And you know, I've talked to so many people. I want to say this.
[1:51:27.280 --> 1:51:40.280]  I've even talked to or talked with, if you will, people who voted, quote, Democrat all their lives, all their lives, who the last election, quote, unquote, election, that that's it.
[1:51:40.280 --> 1:51:48.280]  I can no longer, I can no longer meaning they could no longer go with the Democrats because it's not the Republicans are perfect.
[1:51:48.280 --> 1:51:51.280]  But we know the Democrats appear evil. So what do you think is going to happen next?
[1:51:51.280 --> 1:52:01.280]  I think what's going to happen next is they're going to try on steroids. What they tried two years ago, I think they're going to try it on steroids.
[1:52:01.280 --> 1:52:10.280]  But at the same time, I think they're very fearful. And by they, I mean the deep state, I mean the globalists, I mean the elite and the super elite behind the elite.
[1:52:10.280 --> 1:52:22.280]  They are going to try to hoodwink us bamboozle us, as Malcolm said, once again. But this time they know that millions and millions of people are watching.
[1:52:22.280 --> 1:52:30.280]  I agree. Because here's the deal. I'm not for violence, but for civil disobedience. They're burning down Bill Gates businesses all over Europe right now, all over Sri Lanka, China.
[1:52:30.280 --> 1:52:41.280]  They're raising the central banks. They're playing they're flying gas and flags in Brazil and Argentina and in South Africa. They're this is 1776 worldwide.
[1:52:41.280 --> 1:52:43.280]  They are scared right now.
[1:52:43.280 --> 1:52:52.280]  It is 1776 worldwide. It's not just it's not just a thing. You know, some people might think, oh, that's a nice thing.
[1:52:52.280 --> 1:53:02.280]  What's more than a nice thing? It is reality. It is 1776 worldwide. And we'd better damn well understand it. And we have to be a part of that.
[1:53:02.280 --> 1:53:11.280]  Let's remember the American Revolution. People say, oh, yeah, all the Americans are calling us stood up. No, they didn't. Less than one 10.
[1:53:11.280 --> 1:53:19.280]  Less than one 10 stood up and laid their lives on the line for our Republic to build our Republic.
[1:53:19.280 --> 1:53:27.280]  And they weren't perfect. But the idea was amazing. And we're building towards that. But Martin Luther King talked about our children on that hill together in peace.
[1:53:27.280 --> 1:53:34.280]  That's right. That's right. That's right. And of course, they now like to tear down the statues of Dr. King. Wouldn't they?
[1:53:34.280 --> 1:53:42.280]  They'd like to tear down the statues of Frederick Douglass. Oh, my God, he was a Republican, a Republican. Oh, my God, you know, a slave abolitionist.
[1:53:42.280 --> 1:53:50.280]  For those that don't know, Pinkney knows this. They're tearing down Martin Luther King statues at major universities, saying he wasn't liberal enough.
[1:53:50.280 --> 1:54:01.280]  Right, right. And what we're dealing with, and I'm glad you use the word, my good brother, liberal, because what we're dealing with today on, what is it, July the 12th, 2022,
[1:54:01.280 --> 1:54:13.280]  what we're dealing with today is what I term as a former university instructor, quote unquote, of political science and history. I call it neoliberal fascism.
[1:54:13.280 --> 1:54:14.280]  Exactly.
[1:54:14.280 --> 1:54:17.280]  It's described neoliberals. The people who know who the enemy is.
[1:54:17.280 --> 1:54:32.280]  All right. We understand that neoliberals are trying to push their depraved, their degenerate, their disgusting ideology. You see, these people are ideology or ideology driven.
[1:54:32.280 --> 1:54:42.280]  They are not driven by pragmatism or common sense. Forget common sense. It's no longer common. But we will bring it back just as we will bring our republic back.
[1:54:42.280 --> 1:54:49.280]  So this is what those people are driven by. That's why they're so arrogant. That's why they look down on us.
[1:54:49.280 --> 1:55:03.280]  I listened to how you described, you know, this, this, this idiot who said, you know, tacos, right, Jill Stein, so-called doctor, Jill, not Jill Stein, Jill, Jill Biden.
[1:55:03.280 --> 1:55:17.280]  Oh my God, the president's wife. What can I say what there is of a president? But anyway, Jill Biden, the bottom line is that, you know, how do you insult people and get away with it?
[1:55:17.280 --> 1:55:24.280]  They have dumbed us down, but we are reversing this. We are reversing it every single hour.
[1:55:24.280 --> 1:55:31.280]  We are winning. No one can deny we're winning. How do you expect in these two powerful forces coming together?
[1:55:31.280 --> 1:55:34.280]  What do you, what does Larry Pinckney thinks about to happen?
[1:55:34.280 --> 1:55:43.280]  Well, I think we're about to see, well, you said it. I'm just going to repeat what you said. I see right now a reawakening.
[1:55:43.280 --> 1:55:54.280]  Even if people do not fully understand what is happening, they know that what we're dealing with now is a sick, corrupt system, top to bottom.
[1:55:54.280 --> 1:56:03.280]  Okay, they know that and they may not have the answers. And I noticed I said answers, not answer. There are many answers, plural.
[1:56:03.280 --> 1:56:13.280]  But they do know it has to be changed. That's what I see. And we, you, I'm so proud of you, Alex. I am so proud of you, brother.
[1:56:13.280 --> 1:56:21.280]  I am so proud. I cannot emphasize that. I'm proud of you and Owen and all of you.
[1:56:21.280 --> 1:56:27.280]  I'm so proud of you, brothers and sisters, because the more they throw at you, the stronger you become.
[1:56:27.280 --> 1:56:36.280]  And as we said in the original Black Panther Party, not the so-called fake frauds, not the so-called new blacks, we said all power to the people.
[1:56:36.280 --> 1:56:43.280]  And who are the people? The people are my brothers and sisters, be they black, white, brown, red, yellow, American citizens.
[1:56:43.280 --> 1:56:52.280]  All right? And that's why I'm proud of you. You keep getting stronger. You, your listeners, all of us. So, I mean, whatever.
[1:56:52.280 --> 1:56:57.280]  Larry, you're one of the most sincere people out there. How do people find Larry Pinckney? You have a Band-Aid video channel.
[1:56:57.280 --> 1:57:02.280]  I'd love it if you did more. We love you. We need to work with you more. How do people find Larry Pinckney?
[1:57:02.280 --> 1:57:22.280]  Well, you can find me at Black Activist, that's blackactivistwg.org, blackactivist.org. You know how I am, Alex?
[1:57:22.280 --> 1:57:32.280]  I don't push myself. I want to see our people, my brothers and sisters, black, white, brown, red, and yellow citizens of this republic. I want to see us succeed.
[1:57:32.280 --> 1:57:33.280]  I want to see us succeed.
[1:57:33.280 --> 1:57:42.280]  A proud human future. Larry Pinckney, we love you. And listen, we got you right now. I want to do a Saturday special with you for like an hour live this Saturday or whenever you want.
[1:57:42.280 --> 1:57:47.280]  Those are big shows. We love you. Get him on the show, guys.
[1:57:47.280 --> 1:57:56.280]  Seven months ago, in December of 2021, we launched the first in the three-coin founding member series, George Washington, Slaying the Dragon.
[1:57:56.280 --> 1:58:02.280]  Then, we launched the Tree of Liberty coin, and finally, the Second Amendment common-ticket Molan Labe coin.
[1:58:02.280 --> 1:58:18.280]  There are only 75 coins left in the three-coin series, exclusively right now at 1776coin.com. And for the final 75 people to become founding members for this big project we're launching in the near future,
[1:58:18.280 --> 1:58:31.280]  you'll also get a personal signed piece of art I made of the sheepdog chasing the wolf in a personal message. It's your last chance to get all three coins at 1776coin.com.
[1:58:31.280 --> 1:58:46.280]  This is history happening now. Info War Station's support is changing the world, and this is the final 75 three-coin set exclusively available at 1776coin.com.
[1:59:01.280 --> 1:59:16.280]  It'll eat the oil off of your driveway if you just add water. But it's been so successful now, we're selling it to major RV parks, pig farms, you name it, because this stuff will eat anything that is organic.
[1:59:16.280 --> 1:59:22.280]  And it's exclusively available at thebiopros.com and now infowarstore.com.
[1:59:22.280 --> 1:59:31.280]  We sold out of this for almost a year, but we made a major purchase and it is now in stock for whatever your need is at infowarstore.com.
[1:59:31.280 --> 1:59:37.280]  You'll also find instructional videos and more information at infowarstore.com or thebiopros.com.
[1:59:37.280 --> 1:59:55.280]  Made in America, powered by God's great creation, it is amazing and it funds the infowar.
[2:00:08.280 --> 2:00:36.280]  Powerful calls. What Larry Pickney had to say about there is a great awakening going on.
[2:00:36.280 --> 2:00:43.280]  And it is, make no mistake, you are the catalyst behind this, Alex. And I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[2:00:43.280 --> 2:00:45.280]  No doubt people are waiting up for this.
[2:00:45.280 --> 2:00:54.280]  Let me interrupt you. I'm not being rude, Brian. If we give me credit, it's a lie. The listeners and you, Brian, are the catalyst. All of us together did this.
[2:00:54.280 --> 2:01:00.280]  Because if we think Alex Jones did it, that's a joke. We need to give the credit to you. Go ahead.
[2:01:00.280 --> 2:01:10.280]  You're the motivator. I agree with you, but I really appreciate and everybody, it does appreciate what you put yourself through.
[2:01:10.280 --> 2:01:18.280]  I appreciate you, Brian. Just keep me the fight. All I have nightmares about these people.
[2:01:18.280 --> 2:01:25.280]  I want to beat them. So thank you for helping me beat them. That's all I'm saying, brother. All I'm going to do is beat them. We're going to do it together. Go ahead and make a point.
[2:01:25.280 --> 2:01:32.280]  We have been blessed by the Bible and it lets us know the whole outcome of all this.
[2:01:32.280 --> 2:01:39.280]  But the one thing that we do not know and we have to keep remembering is we don't know the timeframe. No man knows it.
[2:01:39.280 --> 2:01:46.280]  So the fight that we're putting up needs to continue, needs to stay strong. And that's the purpose of my call.
[2:01:46.280 --> 2:01:58.280]  We need to grow the Info Wars infrastructure. And just in a raw idea, we need the churches. We need to do this through the way God wants us to do it.
[2:01:58.280 --> 2:02:05.280]  But we don't need every church. We know that we have been let down by the churches.
[2:02:05.280 --> 2:02:16.280]  We need committed churches to get on board to grow this Info Wars outreach, if you will, a place that people can still gather.
[2:02:16.280 --> 2:02:23.280]  We know we're going to be attacked. It's coming. It's going to be more difficult, possibly in the future.
[2:02:23.280 --> 2:02:35.280]  People may have no power, but it means if we had infrastructure of churches on board where people could go to and connect.
[2:02:35.280 --> 2:02:39.280]  I totally agree. If churches would get off the bench, we'd fix this right away.
[2:02:39.280 --> 2:02:48.280]  And that's the thing. If they get on board, that's the ones that we want. If they don't want to be, if they want to be a prophet church, a mega church, if you will.
[2:02:48.280 --> 2:02:55.280]  They'll pretend in like they'll just hide and they'll be passed over. No, we're going to lose everything if they don't get off their ass.
[2:02:55.280 --> 2:03:05.280]  You know, it's a shame. I've met more people my age whose parents have had them in church predominantly their whole life, which is a great thing.
[2:03:05.280 --> 2:03:11.280]  However, when I talk to a majority of these people, they know nothing about revelation.
[2:03:11.280 --> 2:03:16.280]  They have no idea that it's all being fulfilled. They have no idea it's all here.
[2:03:16.280 --> 2:03:21.280]  They know the feel good message. And there's nothing wrong with that. There should be a balance, though.
[2:03:21.280 --> 2:03:24.280]  And in the times that we're living in, people...
[2:03:24.280 --> 2:03:29.280]  They're babies. They stay babies. It's time to grow up.
[2:03:29.280 --> 2:03:36.280]  They need to know about the mark of the beast. They need to know. They need to stay stern.
[2:03:36.280 --> 2:03:43.280]  But anyway, I just hope you consider this. I'm sure it's something that you thought about, but we need the churches.
[2:03:43.280 --> 2:03:48.280]  Brother, I want the churches to get on board. I go to mega churches in Austin and the pastors are listeners.
[2:03:48.280 --> 2:03:52.280]  And then they're doing an okay job, but they need to go all the way. God bless you.
[2:03:52.280 --> 2:03:59.280]  All right, look, I'll get to Jason, Marie, Sally, Chris, Jeremiah, Deborah, Jeremiah.
[2:03:59.280 --> 2:04:04.280]  Never had two Jeremiah's. We had two Jeremiah's. That's wild.
[2:04:04.280 --> 2:04:08.280]  Jeremiah, Virginia, and in California. And Heath, I'll get to all of you.
[2:04:08.280 --> 2:04:14.280]  We got Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, one of the leading doctors exposed in his tyranny, medical doctor coming up straight ahead.
[2:04:14.280 --> 2:04:20.280]  And we've got so many clips. Major European studies confirming that the mRNA shot takes over your DNA.
[2:04:20.280 --> 2:04:24.280]  Major studies that it is causing cancer or mass death.
[2:04:24.280 --> 2:04:28.280]  Record death that she predicted here two and a half years ago.
[2:04:28.280 --> 2:04:33.280]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny is coming up in just 60 seconds on the other side of this.
[2:04:33.280 --> 2:04:39.280]  And I hope every amazing listener of a race, color and creed that's got red blood that God made
[2:04:39.280 --> 2:04:44.280]  will share the live feeds of info wars.com and news wars.com and banned out video right now
[2:04:44.280 --> 2:04:49.280]  because they wouldn't be trying to censor if this didn't hurt him. It hurts them bad.
[2:04:49.280 --> 2:04:53.280]  We're going to protect the people straight ahead. Dr. Sherry Tenpenny straight ahead. Stay with us.
[2:04:57.280 --> 2:05:02.280]  Several years ago, I approached one of the top companies in the U.S.
[2:05:02.280 --> 2:05:07.280]  that supplies the highest quality signature reducing Faraday cages, the Pentagon
[2:05:07.280 --> 2:05:12.280]  and other U.S. government agencies. And now they have produced specifically for us
[2:05:12.280 --> 2:05:17.280]  this made in America, high end line at a very affordable price.
[2:05:17.280 --> 2:05:22.280]  Whether it's small pouches that protect your cell phone or big pouches that protect laptops
[2:05:22.280 --> 2:05:28.280]  and iPads or big bags that promote whatever electronics you want to put in like desktop computers.
[2:05:28.280 --> 2:05:34.280]  It's all exclusively available at infowarstore.com under the Redux name.
[2:05:34.280 --> 2:05:40.280]  Redux is info wars taking the highest quality products and bringing them directly to you at infowarstore.com.
[2:05:40.280 --> 2:05:46.280]  In this insane world, you are crazy if you don't protect your signature, your identity
[2:05:46.280 --> 2:05:50.280]  from identity theft, hackers, criminals, corporations, governments.
[2:05:50.280 --> 2:05:59.280]  This is one of the hottest items out there today that's exclusively available at infowarstore.com.
[2:06:20.280 --> 2:06:32.280]  It's not about credit. It's about results.
[2:06:32.280 --> 2:06:40.280]  And of the Dr. Merkullis and Muckullis and countless other great men and women that have stood up
[2:06:40.280 --> 2:06:46.280]  to the evil of the genetic biological chemical attack through these shots.
[2:06:46.280 --> 2:06:54.280]  Dr. Sherry Tinpinny, I've been interviewing more than 20 years and she's here with us now
[2:06:54.280 --> 2:06:59.280]  to talk about the latest developments of medical doctor who saw the problems in her own patients
[2:06:59.280 --> 2:07:06.280]  who successfully and accurately predicted two and a half years ago on this show what is now confirmed.
[2:07:06.280 --> 2:07:10.280]  All the insurance actuaries, the Wall Street Journal, all of them.
[2:07:10.280 --> 2:07:16.280]  Oh my God, record deaths in young people, record deaths 18 to 63.
[2:07:16.280 --> 2:07:21.280]  The vaccines aren't vaccines. They're a racial immune system and it's all hanging out there,
[2:07:21.280 --> 2:07:27.280]  but nothing is being done about it. And now they're coming back with more lockdowns and more four shots
[2:07:27.280 --> 2:07:31.280]  and their next attack. So she joins us now.
[2:07:31.280 --> 2:07:35.280]  Dr. Sherry Tinpinny, one of the country's most knowledgeable and outspoken physicians
[2:07:35.280 --> 2:07:42.280]  regarding the impact of vaccines on health, tinpinnyimc.com, website vaxxerwith2xs.com,
[2:07:42.280 --> 2:07:48.280]  Twitter, busy Dr. T. And she joins us to talk about brain damage.
[2:07:48.280 --> 2:07:53.280]  We are now seeing from the shots, blood clots, the agenda, the history of money, gold, silver,
[2:07:53.280 --> 2:07:58.280]  and I'll prepare for the next steps. Dr. Tinpinny.com, doctor, we salute you and we thank you
[2:07:58.280 --> 2:08:02.280]  and we wish you weren't vindicated but you certainly are in spades.
[2:08:02.280 --> 2:08:06.280]  You're here with us now. You've got the floor.
[2:08:06.280 --> 2:08:11.280]  Thank you so much, Alex. And yes, it's been almost 23 years that we've been having these conversations
[2:08:11.280 --> 2:08:16.280]  about vaccines that then rolled over into the pandemic and then of course the COVID injections
[2:08:16.280 --> 2:08:22.280]  and jabs, which are not vaccines. And you're right, it's not a good feeling to know that
[2:08:22.280 --> 2:08:28.280]  everything that I said back in March of 2020 in terms of the pandemic, in terms of the masks,
[2:08:28.280 --> 2:08:33.280]  the myth of the masks, the nonsense of the social distancing, the fraud of the PCR tests,
[2:08:33.280 --> 2:08:38.280]  and all of the stuff in the 40 mechanisms of injury of how these shots can make you sick or kill you.
[2:08:38.280 --> 2:08:44.280]  And I said that somewhere between March of 2020 and March of 2021 that the tsunami of deaths
[2:08:44.280 --> 2:08:49.280]  that would be coming, the tsunami of injuries, and I just heard your segment about the churches
[2:08:49.280 --> 2:08:54.280]  and hopefully the churches will not fail us as miserably the second time around when we see the
[2:08:54.280 --> 2:09:01.280]  tsunami of regrets and remorse and of sadness when all these people are dying and that the church
[2:09:01.280 --> 2:09:06.280]  will be there and we'll see the greatest revival ever. Because what we're now seeing in terms of brain
[2:09:06.280 --> 2:09:13.280]  injury from these shots is just irrefutable. I mean, what is actually causing something called tau
[2:09:13.280 --> 2:09:20.280]  apathies? There's two sub-stacks that I wrote about it. My sub-stacks are I on the evidence at
[2:09:20.280 --> 2:09:26.280]  substack.com and are your friends and family members brain damaged by something that is destroying
[2:09:26.280 --> 2:09:32.280]  what's called alpha-sensiton, which turns into Lewy body dementia and Parkinson's disease anywhere
[2:09:32.280 --> 2:09:36.280]  three to ten years out from when this is happening. So any of the people that say,
[2:09:36.280 --> 2:09:41.280]  I got the shot and I'm just fine, they've got to be looking over their shoulder for years in terms of
[2:09:41.280 --> 2:09:47.280]  neuropathic problems, dementias, and other types of things that will be going on with their brain
[2:09:47.280 --> 2:09:55.280]  and their immune system. When I wrote the article, I wrote a second article on sub-stacks that said,
[2:09:55.280 --> 2:10:01.280]  that was called, I got the shot and I'm just fine because I'm sure that that could resonate to you
[2:10:01.280 --> 2:10:05.280]  with thousands if not millions of your listeners that they hear that from their friends and family
[2:10:05.280 --> 2:10:11.280]  members. But the problem is that the blood-brain barrier is being broken by these spike proteins
[2:10:11.280 --> 2:10:16.280]  that are manufactured by these shots and also by the chemicals that are inside of the shots,
[2:10:16.280 --> 2:10:22.280]  thankfully glycol, the graphene oxide, and the heaven only knows what else is in there of those shots
[2:10:22.280 --> 2:10:27.280]  and I say that in air quotes, that is damaging the blood-brain barrier. And the blood-brain barrier
[2:10:27.280 --> 2:10:33.280]  is now called, they call it the neurovascular unit, and it's the blood that surrounds the brain
[2:10:33.280 --> 2:10:39.280]  and incorporates the spinal cord. And what they're actually saying is that this is actually going to be
[2:10:39.280 --> 2:10:44.280]  causing, and let me read this to you, it's the dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier is rapidly
[2:10:44.280 --> 2:10:50.280]  expanding and can cause numerous pathological conditions such as ischemic strokes, infections,
[2:10:50.280 --> 2:10:58.280]  epilepsy, tumors, drug-resistant epilepsy, neuro-inflammatory diseases called tauopathy.
[2:10:58.280 --> 2:11:06.280]  The breakdown of the blood-brain barrier is an early independent biomarker of human cognitive decline.
[2:11:06.280 --> 2:11:10.280]  So let me interrupt you. I'm not a medical doctor like you are that predicted all this.
[2:11:10.280 --> 2:11:16.280]  One sentence, Alex. How proteins have been found in 40 to 50% of people with the blood-brain barrier
[2:11:16.280 --> 2:11:20.280]  that's been destroyed. So we can document this by blood tests.
[2:11:20.280 --> 2:11:26.280]  No, start over. I'm going to interrupt you. My point is, I read the headlines, blood plots at record level,
[2:11:26.280 --> 2:11:31.280]  oh, the soft drinks you're making happen, this is happening, they admit all this death is happening
[2:11:31.280 --> 2:11:36.280]  and they're trying to act like it's not the shot. So recap what you were saying, I just want to inject that.
[2:11:36.280 --> 2:11:40.280]  Yeah, and now I read one yesterday that they're trying to blame coffee.
[2:11:40.280 --> 2:11:46.280]  Coffee as being the reason for blood clots that we know that that's simply not true.
[2:11:46.280 --> 2:11:50.280]  And I think that a lot of these things with monkeypox and with these hemorrhagic fevers,
[2:11:50.280 --> 2:11:55.280]  they want to start the fear machine mongering again so that everybody will lock down and wear a mask
[2:11:55.280 --> 2:11:58.280]  and all the stupid stuff with putting Q-tips up their nose.
[2:11:58.280 --> 2:12:02.280]  And all that's doing is covering up the side effects.
[2:12:02.280 --> 2:12:11.280]  The Pfizer had documented more than 1,100 diseases, disorders, and types of problems
[2:12:11.280 --> 2:12:15.280]  that were going to be caused by these Pfizer shots, and they knew about it before they even released them.
[2:12:15.280 --> 2:12:18.280]  Exactly. So I interrupted you and messed up what you were saying earlier.
[2:12:18.280 --> 2:12:22.280]  Recapped that because that's important and then continue on.
[2:12:22.280 --> 2:12:28.280]  Just the fact that the disruption of the blood-brain barrier, the blood-brain barrier is the endothelial cells
[2:12:28.280 --> 2:12:34.280]  that are really super tightly joined together, that they really regulate what is allowed into the brain.
[2:12:34.280 --> 2:12:39.280]  The spike proteins and the chemicals in these shots are breaking down the blood-brain barrier.
[2:12:39.280 --> 2:12:44.280]  And as that gets broken, we could actually measure something called tau proteins,
[2:12:44.280 --> 2:12:52.280]  spelled T-A-U, tau proteins in the blood as an acute independent marker of cognitive dysfunction.
[2:12:52.280 --> 2:12:56.280]  So these people that you're seeing that can't talk, can't finish sentences,
[2:12:56.280 --> 2:13:00.280]  are really grasping for different types of things that they didn't do before.
[2:13:00.280 --> 2:13:04.280]  And when I wrote the article, I got the shot and I'm just fine, and I wrote the other article.
[2:13:04.280 --> 2:13:08.280]  Are your friends and family members brain damaged by the shots?
[2:13:08.280 --> 2:13:11.280]  I meant it. I really meant it, that this is actually happening.
[2:13:11.280 --> 2:13:15.280]  And this is just one element of the neurocognitive decline.
[2:13:15.280 --> 2:13:19.280]  The other is the cardiovascular markers and what we're seeing with myocarditis.
[2:13:19.280 --> 2:13:22.280]  I wrote another article on my substack about myocarditis.
[2:13:22.280 --> 2:13:28.280]  And all of these things are happening. And Alex, these are just two of 1,100 different things.
[2:13:28.280 --> 2:13:33.280]  And we go back to October of 2020, the CDC's own document said this would happen.
[2:13:33.280 --> 2:13:35.280]  So they knew Dr. Timpinning.
[2:13:35.280 --> 2:13:38.280]  They did. They've known it from the beginning.
[2:13:38.280 --> 2:13:42.280]  And the judge that has told them to release 55,000 documents per month,
[2:13:42.280 --> 2:13:45.280]  and so far I believe it's only been about 1,200,
[2:13:45.280 --> 2:13:48.280]  they are really, what are they trying to hide?
[2:13:48.280 --> 2:13:53.280]  That they wanted to bury for 75 years, which is all the people that are alive
[2:13:53.280 --> 2:13:57.280]  and doing the CEOs and doing the bench researchers and all these things now would be dead
[2:13:57.280 --> 2:13:59.280]  and it would be into the next generation.
[2:13:59.280 --> 2:14:03.280]  So they wanted to literally bury the data so that we would not know
[2:14:03.280 --> 2:14:06.280]  of all these horrifying things that were going to be happening.
[2:14:06.280 --> 2:14:11.280]  The infertility, the cardiac problems, the autoimmune diseases, the long list of autoimmune diseases,
[2:14:11.280 --> 2:14:15.280]  the long list of cancers in every organ system of the body.
[2:14:15.280 --> 2:14:19.280]  This is full out war on the human race, on the human race.
[2:14:19.280 --> 2:14:22.280]  And yes, the churches, like you said in your last segment,
[2:14:22.280 --> 2:14:26.280]  which is one of the things I talk about a lot when I'm out doing my public talks,
[2:14:26.280 --> 2:14:30.280]  is how involved we need to be fighting the spiritual batter here
[2:14:30.280 --> 2:14:35.280]  and the churches really do need to step it up and get involved.
[2:14:35.280 --> 2:14:38.280]  Wow. You got so much to cover in the next hour.
[2:14:38.280 --> 2:14:41.280]  What do you want to get into next when you come back?
[2:14:41.280 --> 2:14:47.280]  I think that we'll just talk about this a little bit more about the different types of symptoms that people may be having
[2:14:47.280 --> 2:14:50.280]  and that we need to talk about the cognitive dissonance.
[2:14:50.280 --> 2:14:55.280]  And then I'd like to talk a little bit about our summer camp, the summer boot camp that we're doing starting right now.
[2:14:55.280 --> 2:14:58.280]  All right, Dr. Sherry Tenpenny is our guest.
[2:14:58.280 --> 2:15:01.280]  You've done a lot of great websites. What's the best one for folks to visit?
[2:15:01.280 --> 2:15:07.280]  DrTenpenny.com is where you can find most everything that's linked through DrTenpenny.com.
[2:15:07.280 --> 2:15:08.280]  All right, DrTenpenny.com.
[2:15:08.280 --> 2:15:11.280]  Excellent site, incredible information.

[2:15:13.280 --> 2:15:15.280]  Mass death, record death.
[2:15:15.280 --> 2:15:18.280]  They are literally killing us and trying to normalize it.
[2:15:18.280 --> 2:15:19.280]  But we're not going to let them do it.
[2:15:19.280 --> 2:15:21.280]  Well, they enter the lockdowns.
[2:15:21.280 --> 2:15:23.280]  They've got those coming back as well.
[2:15:23.280 --> 2:15:25.280]  We'll talk about this right ahead. Please don't forget.

[2:16:50.280 --> 2:16:51.280]  Quite well.
[2:16:51.280 --> 2:16:54.280]  My barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[2:16:54.280 --> 2:16:56.280]  I go and see him quite often now.
[2:16:56.280 --> 2:17:00.280]  Introducing the newest product from infowarslife.com.

[2:19:01.280 --> 2:19:03.280]  I want to say Brain Force is great.
[2:19:03.280 --> 2:19:05.280]  I want to say Turbo Force is amazing. It is.
[2:19:05.280 --> 2:19:10.280]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[2:19:10.280 --> 2:19:11.280]  The fish oil is better than it.
[2:19:11.280 --> 2:19:13.280]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[2:19:13.280 --> 2:19:19.280]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[2:19:19.280 --> 2:19:22.280]  Fish oil is the best and it'll give you the damn burps.
[2:19:22.280 --> 2:19:25.280]  And I'm sorry, you want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[2:19:25.280 --> 2:19:27.280]  The krill is hallucinogenic. It's so good.
[2:19:27.280 --> 2:19:30.280]  In my view, I'm not a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[2:19:30.280 --> 2:19:33.280]  I eat five caplets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[2:19:33.280 --> 2:19:36.280]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[2:19:36.280 --> 2:19:43.280]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[2:19:43.280 --> 2:19:46.280]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you know what?
[2:19:46.280 --> 2:19:48.280]  I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got,
[2:19:48.280 --> 2:19:49.280]  I just can't lie to you.
[2:19:49.280 --> 2:19:50.280]  I just can't do it.
[2:19:50.280 --> 2:19:52.280]  You put your sword down.
[2:19:52.280 --> 2:20:17.280]  The New World Order
[2:20:17.280 --> 2:20:22.280]  Won't you fly free?
[2:20:22.280 --> 2:20:28.280]  Tell us a little bit about the study that just came out of Sweden that is just so alarming.
[2:20:28.280 --> 2:20:33.280]  The news is buzzing out of Lund University, Malmo, Sweden.
[2:20:33.280 --> 2:20:35.280]  Marcus Alden is the first author.
[2:20:35.280 --> 2:20:40.280]  The first demonstration in a human, a hepatic or liver cell line
[2:20:40.280 --> 2:20:48.280]  that the Pfizer vaccine in fact reverse transcribes and installs DNA into the human genome.
[2:20:48.280 --> 2:20:49.280]  Wow.
[2:20:49.280 --> 2:20:52.280]  And so in simple terms, what does that mean, Dr. Bartlett?
[2:20:52.280 --> 2:20:54.280]  Thank you for making it simple.
[2:20:54.280 --> 2:21:02.280]  So basically there's an enzyme that can take that messenger RNA vaccine information
[2:21:02.280 --> 2:21:06.280]  and put it into the DNA of the person, into their DNA.
[2:21:06.280 --> 2:21:08.280]  And we were told that could not happen.
[2:21:08.280 --> 2:21:11.280]  So this is in a lab but it's showing that the,
[2:21:11.280 --> 2:21:14.280]  you remember the vaccine is messenger RNA.
[2:21:14.280 --> 2:21:17.280]  And we were told that that messenger RNA could not go into your DNA
[2:21:17.280 --> 2:21:20.280]  but this is showing that in a lab it can.
[2:21:20.280 --> 2:21:22.280]  And so what happens when it does, Dr. Gold?
[2:21:22.280 --> 2:21:24.280]  Well, can I answer slightly different than your question?
[2:21:24.280 --> 2:21:27.280]  So one of the fun things about the last couple years being a doctor and lawyer
[2:21:27.280 --> 2:21:29.280]  is this is a very interesting opportunity
[2:21:29.280 --> 2:21:31.280]  and I think we're going to be bringing another lawsuit
[2:21:31.280 --> 2:21:34.280]  because there's actually federal law that you cannot discriminate against people
[2:21:34.280 --> 2:21:36.280]  for genetic discrimination.
[2:21:36.280 --> 2:21:38.280]  I forgot the acronym, I think it's gene and G-I-N-A.
[2:21:38.280 --> 2:21:39.280]  Gene.
[2:21:39.280 --> 2:21:40.280]  Gene, right?
[2:21:40.280 --> 2:21:43.280]  So this now opens the door to saying that if you're not allowing somebody in
[2:21:43.280 --> 2:21:47.280]  who chose not to get the shot, that you're actually engaging in genetic discrimination.
[2:21:47.280 --> 2:21:52.280]  So I think there's, this Sweden study, I think opens the door to a new type of lawsuit.
[2:21:52.280 --> 2:21:56.280]  If you're pregnant and you have this done, can that then affect your baby?
[2:21:56.280 --> 2:21:57.280]  Yes.
[2:21:57.280 --> 2:22:02.280]  See, this is the alarming finding that CDC says on its website, very explicitly,
[2:22:02.280 --> 2:22:04.280]  this will not change your DNA.
[2:22:04.280 --> 2:22:06.280]  The paper that came out of Sweden.
[2:22:06.280 --> 2:22:08.280]  Now there will be many more to confirm it.
[2:22:08.280 --> 2:22:12.280]  And the steps are to A, confirm it, to confirm that the entire code is installed,
[2:22:12.280 --> 2:22:15.280]  and then to actually confirm that it's expressed,
[2:22:15.280 --> 2:22:20.280]  meaning that the spike protein now is continuously expressed from human cells.
[2:22:20.280 --> 2:22:23.280]  But because the lipid nanoparticle are taken up everywhere,
[2:22:23.280 --> 2:22:25.280]  that means somatic cells in your organs,
[2:22:25.280 --> 2:22:30.280]  but also your gametocytes, actually the cells that actually are the sperm and the egg,
[2:22:30.280 --> 2:22:34.280]  if they are carrying it, that indeed means that, in fact,
[2:22:34.280 --> 2:22:36.280]  it could be passed to the daughter cells.
[2:22:36.280 --> 2:22:40.280]  So that could be an open up for birth defects.
[2:22:40.280 --> 2:22:41.280]  Yes.
[2:22:41.280 --> 2:22:43.280]  This is all part of a depopulation plan.
[2:22:43.280 --> 2:22:45.280]  And it's all coming out now.
[2:22:45.280 --> 2:22:47.280]  How to share a 10 pennies, our guests.
[2:22:47.280 --> 2:22:49.280]  What do you make of that incredible new study that came out?
[2:22:49.280 --> 2:22:53.280]  I know two years ago you warned on this show it could get into your DNA.
[2:22:53.280 --> 2:22:54.280]  Now it's being confirmed.
[2:22:54.280 --> 2:22:56.280]  Where is this going?
[2:22:56.280 --> 2:23:03.280]  Well, it's interesting, Alex, because when I wrote the 20 mechanisms of injury e-book
[2:23:03.280 --> 2:23:06.280]  and then did the webinar on that, it was in May of 2021.
[2:23:06.280 --> 2:23:10.280]  And poor planning on my part, we did that on a Mother's Day weekend
[2:23:10.280 --> 2:23:12.280]  and we had a lot of requests to redo it.
[2:23:12.280 --> 2:23:14.280]  So we rescheduled it for July.
[2:23:14.280 --> 2:23:18.280]  And between May of 21 and July of 21,
[2:23:18.280 --> 2:23:23.280]  I found 20 more mechanisms of injury of how the COVID shots can make you sick or kill you.
[2:23:23.280 --> 2:23:26.280]  40 altogether, two completely different e-books.
[2:23:26.280 --> 2:23:29.280]  They're both available at drtenpenny.com.
[2:23:29.280 --> 2:23:31.280]  And they're all hyperlinked.
[2:23:31.280 --> 2:23:34.280]  That shows exactly what these things are doing.
[2:23:34.280 --> 2:23:39.280]  And it's so interesting because every week now there seems to be more articles that are coming out
[2:23:39.280 --> 2:23:44.280]  confirming everything that I had put out from the mainstream peer reviewed literature
[2:23:44.280 --> 2:23:46.280]  way back in May of 21.
[2:23:46.280 --> 2:23:48.280]  But nobody was reading it.
[2:23:48.280 --> 2:23:49.280]  Nobody was paying attention to it.
[2:23:49.280 --> 2:23:51.280]  Nobody wanted to hear it.
[2:23:51.280 --> 2:23:54.280]  Because it causes such great cognitive dissonance.
[2:23:54.280 --> 2:23:58.280]  Sort of like this fabricated thing they've come up with now called SADS.
[2:23:58.280 --> 2:24:03.280]  SADS, sudden adult distress syndrome.
[2:24:03.280 --> 2:24:06.280]  That people are just suddenly dropping over dead.
[2:24:06.280 --> 2:24:10.280]  That they're just suddenly dropping over dead completely healthy people.
[2:24:10.280 --> 2:24:13.280]  And they don't want to admit that it was the shot.
[2:24:13.280 --> 2:24:17.280]  In fact, one of the articles I read said doctors are completely perplexed
[2:24:17.280 --> 2:24:22.280]  at why these sudden adult death syndromes, why these people are just dropping over dead.
[2:24:22.280 --> 2:24:26.280]  And it's like they're perplexed because they don't want to connect the dots.
[2:24:26.280 --> 2:24:30.280]  And they don't want to connect the dots, in my opinion, for two very important reasons.
[2:24:30.280 --> 2:24:35.280]  One is the fact that most doctors are double jabbed and boosted.
[2:24:35.280 --> 2:24:39.280]  So they're wondering if they are going to be the next one with the sudden adult death syndrome
[2:24:39.280 --> 2:24:41.280]  where they're going to drop over dead.
[2:24:41.280 --> 2:24:46.280]  The other one is knowing how many patients and their practices that they have seen on Monday
[2:24:46.280 --> 2:24:51.280]  they seem to be just fine, they got a shot, and then on Thursday they are suddenly dead.
[2:24:51.280 --> 2:24:55.280]  And some doctors that I believe are still good people that are still thinking
[2:24:55.280 --> 2:24:58.280]  and still have some level of consciousness about this
[2:24:58.280 --> 2:25:02.280]  are wondering if they are complicit in the murder of their patients.
[2:25:02.280 --> 2:25:07.280]  I have a new employee that I hired that left her job because she said,
[2:25:07.280 --> 2:25:11.280]  I saw my doctor that I was working for murder, 81 of my patients,
[2:25:11.280 --> 2:25:14.280]  and I couldn't stand it another minute.
[2:25:14.280 --> 2:25:16.280]  I could no longer participate and be part of it.
[2:25:16.280 --> 2:25:21.280]  And she's one of, I'm sure, thousands of nurses and nurse practitioners
[2:25:21.280 --> 2:25:31.280]  and physicians' assistants across the country that are becoming cognizant about the fact that this is happening.
[2:25:31.280 --> 2:25:32.280]  Yes, exactly.
[2:25:32.280 --> 2:25:37.280]  So big 35,000-foot view, their program, their operation, what was their plan?
[2:25:37.280 --> 2:25:38.280]  How was it going for them?
[2:25:38.280 --> 2:25:41.280]  It seems like as bad as it is, people are waking up.
[2:25:41.280 --> 2:25:46.280]  It seems to me like their plan is blowing up in their face, even though it's caused a lot of carnage.
[2:25:46.280 --> 2:25:48.280]  I believe that that's true.
[2:25:48.280 --> 2:25:50.280]  I believe that they overplayed their hand.
[2:25:50.280 --> 2:25:54.280]  You know, they tried to do the depopulation, and if you didn't die,
[2:25:54.280 --> 2:25:58.280]  then you were going to become sick and chronically ill and be a customer for life.
[2:25:58.280 --> 2:26:04.280]  And then you were going to also be able to, and then if you didn't die from one of their diseases,
[2:26:04.280 --> 2:26:07.280]  you were going to be wired up into the transhumanism movement
[2:26:07.280 --> 2:26:12.280]  and be part of the Internet of Things and the Internet of Bodies and get your microchip and your QR code
[2:26:12.280 --> 2:26:15.280]  for doing business and participating in life.
[2:26:15.280 --> 2:26:20.280]  I think they didn't understand or had any concept of the human resiliency
[2:26:20.280 --> 2:26:25.280]  and of people that were not willing to become slaves and to become robots.
[2:26:25.280 --> 2:26:31.280]  And I do think that they really underplayed their hand on knowing that the Christian people
[2:26:31.280 --> 2:26:37.280]  and the people who would put on the full armor of God and resist the evils and this present darkness
[2:26:37.280 --> 2:26:40.280]  that we are fighting against these powers and principalities.
[2:26:40.280 --> 2:26:45.280]  I think that they underestimated God's hand in this, people's power of prayer in this,
[2:26:45.280 --> 2:26:49.280]  and the willingness of them to fight back.
[2:26:49.280 --> 2:26:53.280]  I agree with that. It's blowing up in their face, so what do you expect them to do next?
[2:26:53.280 --> 2:26:55.280]  I think that they're going to hammer down.
[2:26:55.280 --> 2:26:57.280]  These people are relentless.
[2:26:57.280 --> 2:27:03.280]  They worship Satan. Their depopulation agenda has not been working as well for them
[2:27:03.280 --> 2:27:05.280]  as what they had hoped, at least not as fast.
[2:27:05.280 --> 2:27:07.280]  And they're relentless.
[2:27:07.280 --> 2:27:11.280]  People on our side are nice and they don't want to get involved
[2:27:11.280 --> 2:27:16.280]  and they just don't want to say anything bad about anybody and everybody's entitled to what they want to do.
[2:27:16.280 --> 2:27:20.280]  But the people on the other side are relentless and they do not give up.
[2:27:20.280 --> 2:27:25.280]  They go 24-7 around the clock because they've got every time zone covered.
[2:27:25.280 --> 2:27:30.280]  And I believe that they'll release some other bioterrorism, some other bioterrorism method.
[2:27:30.280 --> 2:27:33.280]  They know that they've learned how to capitalize on fear.
[2:27:33.280 --> 2:27:37.280]  And I'm just hoping and praying that people will say things like,
[2:27:37.280 --> 2:27:42.280]  Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, ain't going to happen.
[2:27:42.280 --> 2:27:47.280]  Exactly. We're in a race to expose their next lockdown, their next bioweapon release.
[2:27:47.280 --> 2:27:49.280]  Their monkeypox, that fear didn't work.
[2:27:49.280 --> 2:27:53.280]  Their new ninja variant didn't create fear. What do you think is coming next?
[2:27:53.280 --> 2:27:58.280]  It might be Ebola. I kind of thought that it would be hemorrhagic fevers and maybe Ebola
[2:27:58.280 --> 2:28:02.280]  even before they went with a monkeypox angle because they already have, in the U.S.,
[2:28:02.280 --> 2:28:07.280]  they already have an approved Ebola vaccine.
[2:28:07.280 --> 2:28:11.280]  It was approved actually in February of 2020.
[2:28:11.280 --> 2:28:14.280]  I had gone to the CDC to thinking I was going to hear about corona
[2:28:14.280 --> 2:28:19.280]  and what we heard instead was their approval of the Ebola vaccine even for pregnant women.
[2:28:19.280 --> 2:28:22.280]  And this was the end of February of 2020.
[2:28:22.280 --> 2:28:26.280]  And it's incredible what they pre-program always comes true.
[2:28:26.280 --> 2:28:30.280]  I want to talk about the future with Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, drtenpenny.com.
[2:28:30.280 --> 2:28:35.280]  I want to talk about blood clots at record levels, the insurance actuaries showing record death,
[2:28:35.280 --> 2:28:39.280]  and more with her. Dr. Sherry Tenpenny is our guest, infowars.com.

[2:32:57.960 --> 2:33:24.960]  Seeing a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:24.960 --> 2:33:33.960]  Arping on wars, we fight, we're griping about the great things are to be. And I don't mind
[2:33:33.960 --> 2:33:40.960]  you switching sides and standing up for things they believe in, when they're running down
[2:33:40.960 --> 2:33:41.960]  my mind.
[2:33:41.960 --> 2:33:46.960]  Well, Dr. Sherry Timpin is our guest on this live Tuesday broadcast. He's a medical doctor
[2:33:46.960 --> 2:33:52.960]  exposing and predicting everything we're in right now. So, Doc, I got to ask a thousand
[2:33:52.960 --> 2:33:59.400]  questions, and I've got a lot of points I want to go over. But front and center for you,
[2:33:59.400 --> 2:34:02.960]  new lockdowns are coming. We talked about that last segment there. They're getting ready
[2:34:02.960 --> 2:34:06.720]  with the new attacks. Where do you see this going? What else do you want to impart to
[2:34:06.720 --> 2:34:09.880]  this audience and millions?
[2:34:09.880 --> 2:34:15.920]  I think that it's really important to protect yourself as best as you can from being around
[2:34:15.920 --> 2:34:20.440]  people who have already received these bioweapon injections. I mean, they've shown that the
[2:34:20.440 --> 2:34:26.520]  spike protein can be spread from person to person by physical contact as an exosome.
[2:34:26.520 --> 2:34:31.080]  And I think it's important to use colloidal silver. I know you've got a great product
[2:34:31.080 --> 2:34:35.440]  that you have for that, hydrogen peroxide, iodine. I know you have a great product for
[2:34:35.440 --> 2:34:39.600]  that. I think those are all really important things. I'm a big fan of ivermectin and will
[2:34:39.600 --> 2:34:44.960]  always be. I think that it's one of the important things that globs onto the spike proteins
[2:34:44.960 --> 2:34:49.480]  and blocks the ACE2 receptors. And we now know that there's a lot of other important
[2:34:49.480 --> 2:34:54.120]  reasons that ivermectin is a good thing. It fights cancer. It's got all kinds of things
[2:34:54.120 --> 2:34:55.120]  in it.
[2:34:55.120 --> 2:34:59.600]  So I think that the food preparation, like what you said on your commercial break there,
[2:34:59.600 --> 2:35:04.040]  is super important to be prepared. We did a prepper, a boot camp that was in the spring,
[2:35:04.040 --> 2:35:10.640]  our boot camp this summer that is open for enrollment right now. It's called Summer Camp.
[2:35:10.640 --> 2:35:15.320]  It's a four-week course compressed into two weeks. So it's four nights. It's Tuesday and
[2:35:15.320 --> 2:35:19.360]  Thursday night for four weeks that we're going to be talking about how to plan a little bit
[2:35:19.360 --> 2:35:24.080]  better in terms of your way forward and thinking about the understanding the history is the
[2:35:24.080 --> 2:35:29.000]  way forward. We're bringing in registered investment advisors. Matt and I are not investment
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:31.840]  advisors. We're not going to tell you what to do with your money or how to spend it or
[2:35:31.840 --> 2:35:32.840]  where to put it.
[2:35:32.840 --> 2:35:37.080]  But we're bringing in people that can. Like Dr. Kirk Elliott is going to be a guest. He's
[2:35:37.080 --> 2:35:40.840]  going to talk about the history of gold and silver. We have another important guest that's
[2:35:40.840 --> 2:35:45.760]  going to talk about the history of constitutional money and why our fiat money is not worth anything
[2:35:45.760 --> 2:35:50.240]  and why we are facing hyperinflation because of that. We're going to be talking about the
[2:35:50.240 --> 2:35:55.640]  history of cryptocurrency. My business partner Matt was one of the original miners of the
[2:35:55.640 --> 2:36:00.440]  original cryptocurrency when it first started. So he's always had a front row seat to try
[2:36:00.440 --> 2:36:06.300]  to explain to people the pros and cons about the history of cryptocurrency and the volatility
[2:36:06.300 --> 2:36:11.720]  and give some people some understanding of the history of it because if you understand
[2:36:11.720 --> 2:36:15.800]  the history, you'll understand things going forward. And then the last night of our boot
[2:36:15.800 --> 2:36:19.360]  camp, which is on July the 28th, it will be the history of the great reset. We're going
[2:36:19.360 --> 2:36:23.240]  to start with the Fabians and come forward all the way through the Rockefellers. We're
[2:36:23.240 --> 2:36:26.840]  going to put it all into a bite side piece so that you can get it all and explain it
[2:36:26.840 --> 2:36:28.760]  to your friends and family members.
[2:36:28.760 --> 2:36:35.440]  So this four week course that is going to be loaded and absolutely loaded with information
[2:36:35.440 --> 2:36:44.760]  is on Tuesday and Thursday nights, you can go to learning for you, learning, L-E-R-N-I-N-G,
[2:36:44.760 --> 2:36:50.640]  the number four, Y-O-U, learningforyou.org, forward slash summer camp and register for
[2:36:50.640 --> 2:36:57.320]  the course. It's $299 for a four week course and for the special bonus, we have a two hour
[2:36:57.320 --> 2:37:02.920]  interview with Catherine Austin Fitz and she wanted to kick off the boot camp because
[2:37:02.920 --> 2:37:07.760]  she felt like it, she had the most to say about it and she did a two hour interview
[2:37:07.760 --> 2:37:14.520]  called the top 10 mistakes people do with their money and honestly the $299 value is
[2:37:14.520 --> 2:37:15.520]  worth it.
[2:37:15.520 --> 2:37:19.760]  Our information has been valuable. So let me throw this out, big picture for you, 35,000
[2:37:19.760 --> 2:37:25.200]  for you. What did the globalist want to do 30 months ago with the COVID release versus
[2:37:25.200 --> 2:37:30.320]  what it did and where you think we are right now? I mean, how did it go for them?
[2:37:30.320 --> 2:37:35.040]  I don't think it's gone so well for them. I mean, yes, we've had carnage, we've had
[2:37:35.040 --> 2:37:40.880]  carnage with our food, with our money, with millions of people being injured and that
[2:37:40.880 --> 2:37:45.720]  we know of at least 1.6 million people that have been injured. We know at least 57,000
[2:37:45.720 --> 2:37:50.560]  people in this country have died. Now, we've seen Steve Kirch has come out and said that
[2:37:50.560 --> 2:37:56.240]  he really believes that it's more like 500,000 people that have died and Dr. David Martin
[2:37:56.240 --> 2:38:01.360]  came out a couple of weeks ago and said he felt there would be 750 million dead people
[2:38:01.360 --> 2:38:08.600]  within by 2028 and I said to David, I said, first of all, I think that your number of
[2:38:08.600 --> 2:38:15.080]  people that are going to die is going to be larger than 750 million by a magnitude and
[2:38:15.080 --> 2:38:19.640]  I think saying it's going to happen by 2028, the timeline is too long. It's going to be
[2:38:19.640 --> 2:38:25.240]  much sooner and much more gravity than that. So on the carnage side, I think that they've
[2:38:25.240 --> 2:38:30.320]  done a pretty good job. They've been met with so much resistance though and I think that
[2:38:30.320 --> 2:38:35.000]  they thought it was going to be a walk in the park. You know, Alex, back in 2020, it
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:40.760]  just was so perplexing to me when this first started on how did they get 190 countries
[2:38:40.760 --> 2:38:47.400]  in the entire world or 194 countries to lock down, put on masks, go into their basement,
[2:38:47.400 --> 2:38:53.520]  mask up their children, get Q-tips crammed up their nose and be subjected to this unbelievable
[2:38:53.520 --> 2:38:58.200]  experimental shot. How did that happen on every country around the world at the same
[2:38:58.200 --> 2:39:02.400]  time? Well, it's by knowing the history of the World Economic Forum and where they started,
[2:39:02.400 --> 2:39:06.880]  it actually started before that in the 20s and then in the 70s when they uncoupled the
[2:39:06.880 --> 2:39:11.320]  dollar from the gold standard and now we've got hyperinflation because we pump so much
[2:39:11.320 --> 2:39:15.800]  money into circulation and if we understood those histories a little bit better, we would
[2:39:15.800 --> 2:39:20.240]  understand better where we are and what they're trying to do to us going forward.
[2:39:20.240 --> 2:39:25.160]  Absolutely. Doesn't it come down to this, they don't want a bunch of baby boomers collecting
[2:39:25.160 --> 2:39:30.240]  social security. At the end of the day, they're trying to depopulate people. It's so obvious.
[2:39:30.240 --> 2:39:34.040]  It's not only the top end. You know, think about this. They don't want their baby boomers
[2:39:34.040 --> 2:39:38.120]  collecting social security. They don't want their elderly collecting and living off of
[2:39:38.120 --> 2:39:42.760]  Medicare and so if they're going to go to all this trouble to kill all these millions
[2:39:42.760 --> 2:39:48.400]  of people on the top end, particularly in the United States and the UK and the five
[2:39:48.400 --> 2:39:54.520]  eye countries, in the more wealthy countries, if they're trying to get rid of the top end,
[2:39:54.520 --> 2:39:58.400]  they certainly don't want those young baby boomers to start having or the young baby,
[2:39:58.400 --> 2:40:03.680]  not baby boomers, but those young people to start having babies to fill up the pipeline
[2:40:03.680 --> 2:40:08.400]  again. So all of these shots that are going to like that little segment you showed of
[2:40:08.400 --> 2:40:12.960]  that Peter McCullough was talking about, yes, those, now we know the spike protein. I already
[2:40:12.960 --> 2:40:18.160]  talked about it in the 40 mechanisms of injury, the spike proteins destroy the sperm, destroy
[2:40:18.160 --> 2:40:24.200]  the eggs and make it make people infertile. So now that we've depopulated from the top,
[2:40:24.200 --> 2:40:28.160]  we certainly don't want those young people having babies and filling up from the bottom.
[2:40:28.160 --> 2:40:33.240]  We have got to destroy humanity at both ends. And that's what's happening. But as you said,
[2:40:33.240 --> 2:40:36.480]  it's not going well for them. So I'll go back to the same question. What do you expect
[2:40:36.480 --> 2:40:41.160]  they're going to pull next? You know, like I said, I think it's going to be one other
[2:40:41.160 --> 2:40:47.400]  biologic. It may be the whole thing with a weaponized form of muckypox. Because people
[2:40:47.400 --> 2:40:51.900]  are saying that, you know, they're getting the muckypox. It's very painful. It seems
[2:40:51.900 --> 2:40:56.960]  to be more in the homosexual population that they weaponized it to try to have these horrible
[2:40:56.960 --> 2:41:01.400]  rashes to cover up the side effects that we're seeing from the Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca
[2:41:01.400 --> 2:41:07.160]  shots. Maybe that they're going to do that. Are they going to be an Ebola, a Marburg related?
[2:41:07.160 --> 2:41:10.560]  Because now we're saying, oh, we're starting to see, you know, hemorrhagic viruses show
[2:41:10.560 --> 2:41:16.240]  up in places we haven't before. Or is it going to be some other completely weaponized virus
[2:41:16.240 --> 2:41:23.280]  or bacteria or something nuclear? I mean, why did they start now suddenly having commercials,
[2:41:23.280 --> 2:41:28.680]  TV commercials telling people what to do in the event of a nuclear attack? Why would
[2:41:28.680 --> 2:41:34.040]  they be doing that? Except more predictive programming. So they want the world population
[2:41:34.040 --> 2:41:39.040]  to go down. They don't want to have it rebuilt back up by a bunch of young people. They want
[2:41:39.040 --> 2:41:44.120]  it. The people that are left will be customers for life of the pharmaceutical industry.
[2:41:44.120 --> 2:41:47.360]  That's right. And for those that don't know, even Elon Musk points out, you've got to have
[2:41:47.360 --> 2:41:51.800]  2.2 children for every two adults or society collapses. So when they're doing all this,
[2:41:51.800 --> 2:41:56.280]  they know it's going to collapse society. Absolutely. It's the plan that's been the
[2:41:56.280 --> 2:42:02.200]  plan since the 70s, probably even before that, because they have to have a smaller set of
[2:42:02.200 --> 2:42:07.200]  serfs that are easily controllable. Now, if we can microchip all those serfs and we know
[2:42:07.200 --> 2:42:11.320]  where they are, we can control their movement and everything that they do by their handheld,
[2:42:11.320 --> 2:42:17.120]  cell phones. And we can actually get the chip into their hand or their forehead like it
[2:42:17.120 --> 2:42:21.560]  talks about in the Bible. So people won't be able to buy, sell, or trade without having
[2:42:21.560 --> 2:42:25.920]  the absolute mark of the beast or a QR code or some other way that you can function in
[2:42:25.920 --> 2:42:32.000]  society to buy food, to buy gasoline, to travel. They want people to be controlled. They want
[2:42:32.000 --> 2:42:37.520]  them to be either microchips. And this has all been announced, Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, final
[2:42:37.520 --> 2:42:42.000]  segment coming up. We're going to hit on this. Another key points you've got to cover and
[2:42:42.000 --> 2:42:45.440]  the blood clots and the rest of it. And then after she leaves us, we'll get to all these
[2:42:45.440 --> 2:42:50.840]  callers ahead of the next guest host taking over. Wow. What a time to be allowed. Dr.
[2:42:50.840 --> 2:42:54.360]  Sherry Tenpenny, two and a half years later, totally vindicated. It all came true. It's
[2:42:54.360 --> 2:42:56.960]  all happening. We're talking about what comes next.
[2:42:56.960 --> 2:43:02.320]  Seven months ago in December of 2021, we launched the first in the three coin founding member
[2:43:02.320 --> 2:43:07.600]  series, George Washington slaying the dragon. Then we launched the Tree of Liberty coin.
[2:43:07.600 --> 2:43:13.760]  And finally, the second amendment, come and take it, Molan Labe coin. There are only 75
[2:43:13.760 --> 2:43:22.960]  points left in the three point series exclusively right now at 1776point.com. And for the final
[2:43:22.960 --> 2:43:28.080]  75 people become founding members for this big project we're launching in the near future.
[2:43:28.080 --> 2:43:33.440]  You'll also get a personal signed piece of art I made of the sheepdog chasing the wolf
[2:43:33.440 --> 2:43:41.280]  and a personal message. It's your last chance to get all three coins at 1776point.com. This
[2:43:41.280 --> 2:43:46.600]  is history happening now. Info workstakes, your support is changing the world. And this
[2:43:46.600 --> 2:43:56.920]  is the final 75 three coin set exclusively available at 1776point.com.
[2:43:56.920 --> 2:44:02.880]  The globalist are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons
[2:44:02.880 --> 2:44:07.400]  and chemicals added to the food. It's all come out. And they're doing that not because
[2:44:07.400 --> 2:44:12.960]  we're weak, but because we're made the image of God, the creator and we are powerful. And
[2:44:12.960 --> 2:44:18.240]  the social engineers fear that so much. So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying
[2:44:18.240 --> 2:44:23.840]  that nobody knows who first came up with the boy. Is it true?
[2:44:23.840 --> 2:44:30.200]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless. They need all their
[2:44:30.200 --> 2:44:35.880]  propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because
[2:44:35.880 --> 2:44:41.040]  they know we are strong. And they know in the end they signed on the God of this world
[2:44:41.040 --> 2:44:45.040]  who is a loser. And that's why it's so important that everybody keep in full wars in the air
[2:44:45.040 --> 2:44:49.880]  now more than ever. Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalist are manifesting
[2:44:49.880 --> 2:44:55.000]  setting up is safe and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast
[2:44:55.000 --> 2:45:00.240]  they just announced. A lot of listeners have told us it's hard to find out of the thousands

[2:45:28.400 --> 2:45:33.080]  I'm telling you it's going to get a lot worse. They have designed this. The way to beat them

[2:47:19.440 --> 2:47:26.120]  hour. I had a way on route taken over because January 6 committee is attacked this big time
[2:47:26.120 --> 2:47:32.560]  just about 30 minutes ago we have the club that's coming up it's pretty crazy. And for
[2:47:32.560 --> 2:47:35.840]  callers I got to most of you but we'll get your number we'll call you back tomorrow get
[2:47:35.840 --> 2:47:40.920]  you on appreciate you holding we can't get to you I appreciate you. Dr. Sharon Timpenny
[2:47:40.920 --> 2:47:46.760]  since you mentioned and here's the New York City official ad promoting nuclear warfare
[2:47:46.760 --> 2:48:00.600]  that you were talking about. So there's been a nuclear attack. Don't ask me how or why
[2:48:00.600 --> 2:48:06.640]  just know that the big one has hit. Okay. So what do we do. There are three important
[2:48:06.640 --> 2:48:14.800]  steps that I want you to remember. Step one get inside fast. You your friends your family
[2:48:14.800 --> 2:48:21.040]  get inside and no staying in the car is not an option. You need to get into a building
[2:48:21.040 --> 2:48:32.400]  and move away from the windows. Step two stay inside shut all doors and windows have a basement
[2:48:32.400 --> 2:48:39.320]  head there. If you don't have one get as far into the middle of the building as possible.
[2:48:39.320 --> 2:48:49.400]  If you were outside after the blast get clean immediately. Remove and get away from your
[2:48:49.400 --> 2:48:56.920]  body. Step three stay tuned. Follow media for more information. Don't forget to sign
[2:48:56.920 --> 2:49:03.000]  up for notify NYC for official alerts. Yeah your internet's gonna work. Don't go outside
[2:49:03.000 --> 2:49:09.360]  until officials say it's safe. All right you've got this. They're getting ready for an economic
[2:49:09.360 --> 2:49:13.600]  collapse. They launched a bio attack. They did a forced injection. They're getting us
[2:49:13.600 --> 2:49:20.800]  ready for the great reset. Dr. Sharon Timpenny. Yeah I mean when you listen to that Alex how
[2:49:20.800 --> 2:49:27.120]  many of those things that she said do you think will work. You know if you're in a nuclear
[2:49:27.120 --> 2:49:32.240]  attack I mean unless the nuclear attack was on the other side of the country and you happen
[2:49:32.240 --> 2:49:37.160]  to be in New York. Yeah if you're in New York the building's falling down on your debt. Exactly
[2:49:37.160 --> 2:49:42.360]  and the radiation goes through and the heat and the explosion the blast everything that
[2:49:42.360 --> 2:49:46.560]  happened and go take a shower by the way and for sure turn on your television and listen
[2:49:46.560 --> 2:49:53.080]  to her broadcast. I mean seriously I mean this is like a joke. It has to be a joke.
[2:49:53.080 --> 2:49:59.400]  But they're clearly doing it just like with COVID for fear. Apparently so. I mean yes
[2:49:59.400 --> 2:50:03.680]  the big one has happened somewhere but it certainly wouldn't that really wouldn't do
[2:50:03.680 --> 2:50:09.560]  anything for you if it happened it was just right outside. I'm telling you that has to
[2:50:09.560 --> 2:50:13.240]  be a joke and if people really believe that and think that that is something that they
[2:50:13.240 --> 2:50:17.240]  could do in the event of nuclear attack you know what it reminds me of Alex. It reminds
[2:50:17.240 --> 2:50:21.840]  me of when we were kids and they had these nuclear drills and you had to get underneath
[2:50:21.840 --> 2:50:27.680]  your chair. Duck and cover. Duck and cover in the first grade like that was going to
[2:50:27.680 --> 2:50:32.600]  do so. So let me ask you this beyond being a medical doctor beyond predicting all this
[2:50:32.600 --> 2:50:37.880]  politically with Joe Biden the Hunter Biden iPhone all of it all this coming out I mean
[2:50:37.880 --> 2:50:43.440]  what would you how would you describe this political moment we're at right now. I just
[2:50:43.440 --> 2:50:49.080]  can't believe that the well let me rephrase that what has not happened is more disturbing
[2:50:49.080 --> 2:50:53.520]  I think than what has happened now that we just in the last couple of days heard about
[2:50:53.520 --> 2:50:58.360]  you know Hunter Biden should be charged with sex trafficking of taking young women young
[2:50:58.360 --> 2:51:03.360]  women prostitutes across state line that was possibly funded by his father. I mean if this
[2:51:03.360 --> 2:51:09.120]  was happening to a Republican could you only imagine what they would be doing in terms
[2:51:09.120 --> 2:51:14.080]  of of uprising and if this was happening to Trump or if this was happened to some other
[2:51:14.080 --> 2:51:18.480]  Republican that would be in public office but because they're protecting Biden and wanting
[2:51:18.480 --> 2:51:23.240]  to keep the puppet in there for whatever reason for as long as possible you know it's going
[2:51:23.240 --> 2:51:27.080]  to be one more thing that probably not much is going to be done about which is really sad
[2:51:27.080 --> 2:51:31.480]  I feel like our entire government is missing in action both sides of the aisle or just
[2:51:31.480 --> 2:51:37.800]  a bunch of rhinos and just really it's very disturbing the fact that what is not happening
[2:51:37.800 --> 2:51:42.400]  in our country is is equally as bad as what has been happening. I totally agree they are
[2:51:42.400 --> 2:51:47.560]  hyping new lockdowns they are hyping masks at national parks they say they're getting
[2:51:47.560 --> 2:51:50.840]  ready for new ones when do you think we'll try the next lockdown after the election or
[2:51:50.840 --> 2:51:56.000]  what are you seeing that? Oh it'll be before the election in my opinion it'll definitely
[2:51:56.000 --> 2:52:02.200]  be any way to try to stop the election whether they'll go to all paper types of they'll go
[2:52:02.200 --> 2:52:05.880]  to like paper ballots and then there won't be enough paper because we have a paper shortage
[2:52:05.880 --> 2:52:10.440]  and then they'll lock it down so people can't go and vote because it's a paper vote you
[2:52:10.440 --> 2:52:13.680]  know they'll shut down the internet they'll say you have to have your QR code to prove
[2:52:13.680 --> 2:52:18.360]  that you were had had been vaccinated not just vaccinated once but double-vaxxed and
[2:52:18.360 --> 2:52:24.040]  boosted at least once if not twice. And that was my last question what do you make of all
[2:52:24.040 --> 2:52:30.720]  the reports of Fauci and of Biden all of them three, four, five shots they're still sick
[2:52:30.720 --> 2:52:33.840]  I know a bunch of people that took the shot they get sick over and over again people that
[2:52:33.840 --> 2:52:38.120]  didn't take the shot keep getting sick since when does a pathogen you catch it three, four
[2:52:38.120 --> 2:52:42.680]  times since when does your body not learn to defeat it that sounds like synthetic to
[2:52:42.680 --> 2:52:47.400]  me. Well you're absolutely right and we know that the more and more data that's coming
[2:52:47.400 --> 2:52:51.520]  out you're much more likely to die if you've been if you've been vaccinated even you're
[2:52:51.520 --> 2:52:54.760]  more likely to die if you've had to even just one shot. What did you make of the Wall Street
[2:52:54.760 --> 2:52:58.920]  Journal two weeks ago that people are double likely to die they've had the shot why they're
[2:52:58.920 --> 2:53:03.840]  even reporting it I mean that's insane. Well and doesn't that just tell you what the status
[2:53:03.840 --> 2:53:08.680]  of things are that now they're trying to cover their tracks because we've known for two years
[2:53:08.680 --> 2:53:15.160]  now that these shots destroy your immune system irreversibly destroy your toll like receptors
[2:53:15.160 --> 2:53:20.560]  which is your primary innate immune system we know that it permanently damages your heart
[2:53:20.560 --> 2:53:25.760]  that the spike protein could go inside of your nucleus and release and stop your body
[2:53:25.760 --> 2:53:30.160]  from protecting you from cancer I mean the list is at least 40 different ways that I've
[2:53:30.160 --> 2:53:34.800]  been able to identify there's probably more that have come out since then but I think
[2:53:34.800 --> 2:53:40.160]  that in terms of what you were asking about the elections they know that they would lose
[2:53:40.160 --> 2:53:47.480]  by a landslide I guess but you know they've never done away with the they've never corrected
[2:53:47.480 --> 2:53:52.960]  the last election fraud problem and what means what makes us think there would be any less
[2:53:52.960 --> 2:53:58.000]  election fraud going forward and will they shut everybody down and not allow people to
[2:53:58.000 --> 2:54:02.820]  leave their house right before they have to go and vote I mean it's just one sinister
[2:54:02.820 --> 2:54:08.080]  plan and one sinister. It's a desperate globalist elite trying to stay in control Dr. Sherry

[2:59:32.800 --> 2:59:39.640]  me in case you haven't noticed the hair and beard formula is working for me quite well
[2:59:39.640 --> 2:59:45.160]  i might add quite well my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men i go and see
[2:59:45.160 --> 3:00:04.920]  him quite often now leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex
[3:00:04.920 --> 3:00:18.560]  you're right back fear is the path to the dark side the fear of change of progress to
[3:00:18.560 --> 3:00:48.520]  defeat the system not this time meet leaders the global food shortages the collapsing supply
[3:00:48.520 --> 3:00:57.520]  chains we warned you about the climate crisis and now you reap what you have sown but there
[3:00:57.520 --> 3:01:06.480]  is still hope thanks again to science we have a solution insects a sustainable equitable
[3:01:06.480 --> 3:01:12.600]  and nutritious source of protein for a fraction of the carbon footprint of livestock we can
[3:01:12.600 --> 3:01:18.480]  finally put an end to the wasteful and cruel practice of meat eating for good so let's
[3:01:18.480 --> 3:01:25.680]  turn this crisis into an opportunity to bring equality to our food systems to mandate social
[3:01:25.680 --> 3:01:31.560]  and cultural change be a net zero hero eat the bugs
[3:01:31.560 --> 3:02:01.080]  and cut
[3:02:31.080 --> 3:02:47.160]  No gig contracts unlocked.
[3:02:47.160 --> 3:02:51.080]  Would you like to try a level 6 gig?
[3:02:51.080 --> 3:02:52.080]  Yes.

[3:02:53.080 --> 3:03:02.080]  Deliver a package from your local Amazon node to pod 512 at 165 Spider-Man Road.
[3:03:02.080 --> 3:03:04.080]  I accept.

[3:03:26.080 --> 3:03:48.080]  Warning.
[3:03:48.080 --> 3:04:12.080]  Warning.
[3:04:12.080 --> 3:04:22.080]  And there is a real change.

[3:04:30.080 --> 3:04:58.080]  Your staked collateral tokens have been slashed. Reputation lost. Trust lost. Your consumption privileges have been restricted from synthetic meat to insect-based foods only.
[3:04:58.080 --> 3:05:12.080]  This is a new film, 2000 mules is the most important documentary in modern times because it proves how the deep state stole the 2020 election and how they're planning to steal future elections and complete our journey to basically being like Venezuela.
[3:05:12.080 --> 3:05:25.080]  It's great that it's online, it's great that millions watch it online, but you need to have the high quality HD DVD in your library with the expanded extras so it can't be censored in the future and so you can show it to everyone you know.
[3:05:25.080 --> 3:05:43.080]  Go to infowarstore.com and get 2000 mules today and get it discounted up to 30% off when you get it with other documentary films like in-game blueprint for global enslavement, the seminal classic that predicted the great reset, and of course Part 1, Part 2, and now the new Part 3 of COVIDland.
[3:05:43.080 --> 3:05:54.080]  Get them separate, get them together, massively discounted at infowarstore.com, but everyone needs to have 2000 mules in their library so the globalists can't censor it.
[3:05:54.080 --> 3:05:58.080]  Go to infowarstore.com to get 2000 mules today.
[3:06:25.080 --> 3:06:34.080]  Well, attacking the capital made people trying to protest the election, which is legal and lawful, look like idiots, and I was there and tried to stop it, but it's true.
[3:06:34.080 --> 3:06:42.080]  Matt Bracken had been a guest here many times, and he co-hosted the show many times, just like Wayne Allen Roots about to take over here in a few minutes.
[3:06:42.080 --> 3:06:54.080]  And one time when I was in town, he got up there days before January 6th and said, storm the capital. The funny thing was, he would never come on the show or talk to us after January 6th.
[3:06:54.080 --> 3:07:07.080]  I don't know what's going on with old Matt Bracken and enemies firing at domestic. I just know that he said those things on air on my show when I wasn't here, and then they attacked me for it.
[3:07:07.080 --> 3:07:19.080]  Very, very interesting. If he'd come on and explain it, it'd be great, but I didn't see that information until six months ago when the January 6th McCarthy 2.0 hearing subpoenaed me.
[3:07:19.080 --> 3:07:24.080]  They tried to call Matt. He won't talk to us. Maybe Matt will come on sometime and discuss it with us.
[3:07:24.080 --> 3:07:31.080]  But regardless, you see them storming Sri Lanka and storming the Netherlands and storming everywhere, and the media's like, oh, that's protest.
[3:07:31.080 --> 3:07:41.080]  Well, they burned buildings down. I'm not calling for that. But when we're there, peaceful with the president at the ellipse, and then a million people there and a few hundred going to the capital, it's all to blame on us.
[3:07:41.080 --> 3:07:50.080]  This is the Democratic Party trying to outlaw their political opposition. So the committee asked me about Matt Bracken. I can't tell you about Matt Bracken. He won't talk to me.
[3:07:50.080 --> 3:07:56.080]  But it is interesting. He said that days before it happened right here on these airwaves. Here's the clip.
[3:07:56.080 --> 3:08:07.080]  Trump's purpose was to mobilize a crowd. And how do you mobilize a crowd in 2020? With millions of followers on Twitter, President Trump knew exactly how to do it.
[3:08:07.080 --> 3:08:20.080]  At 1.42 a.m. on December 19, 2020, shortly after the last participants left the unhinged meeting, Trump sent out the tweet with his explosive invitation.
[3:08:20.080 --> 3:08:28.080]  Trump repeated his big lie and claimed it was, quote, statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 election.
[3:08:28.080 --> 3:08:37.080]  Before calling for a big protest in D.C. on January 6th, be there will be wild.
[3:08:37.080 --> 3:08:51.080]  And pause. Back it up two seconds. Biden has a 6% approval rating with Democrats under 30 and a 40% approval rating with Democrats at 90% this Republicans. You really believe he won the election?
[3:08:51.080 --> 3:09:02.080]  I mean, what a joke. Let's continue. Be there will be wild. Trump supporters responded immediately.
[3:09:02.080 --> 3:09:15.080]  Women for America First, a pro-Trump organizing group, had previously applied for rally permit for January 22nd and 23rd in Washington, D.C. several days after Joe Biden was to be inaugurated.
[3:09:15.080 --> 3:09:27.080]  But in the hours after the tweet, they moved their permit to January 6th, two weeks before. This rescheduling created the rally where Trump would eventually speak.
[3:09:27.080 --> 3:09:41.080]  The next day, Ali Alexander, leader of the Stop the Steel organization and a key mobilizer of Trump supporters, registered wildprotest.com named after Trump's tweet.
[3:09:41.080 --> 3:09:54.080]  Wildprotest.com provided comprehensive information about numerous newly organized protest events in Washington. It included event times, places, speakers, and details on transportation in Washington, D.C.
[3:09:54.080 --> 3:10:04.080]  Meanwhile, other key Trump supporters, including far-right media personalities, began promoting the wild protest on January 6th.
[3:10:04.080 --> 3:10:15.080]  It's Saturday, December 19th, the year of 2020, and one of the most historic events in American history has just taken place.
[3:10:15.080 --> 3:10:28.080]  President Trump, in the early morning hours today, tweeted that he wants the American people to march on Washington, D.C. on January 6th, 2021.
[3:10:28.080 --> 3:10:35.080]  And now Donald Trump is calling on his supporters to descend on Washington, D.C., January 6th.
[3:10:35.080 --> 3:10:41.080]  He is now calling on we, the people, to take action and to show our numbers.
[3:10:41.080 --> 3:10:55.080]  We're going to only be saved by millions of Americans moving to Washington, occupying the entire area, if necessary, storming right into the Capitol.
[3:10:55.080 --> 3:11:04.080]  You know, we know the rules of engagement. If you have enough people, you can push down any kind of a fence or a wall.
[3:11:04.080 --> 3:11:12.080]  This could be Trump's last stand, and it's a time when he has specifically called on his supporters to arrive in D.C.
[3:11:12.080 --> 3:11:19.080]  That's something that may actually be the big push Trump supporters need to say this is it. It's now or never.
[3:11:19.080 --> 3:11:23.080]  You better understand something, son. You better understand something.
[3:11:23.080 --> 3:11:28.080]  Red wave, bitch. This is going to be a red wedding going down January 6th.
[3:11:28.080 --> 3:11:34.080]  On that day, Trump says, show up for a protest. It's going to be wild.
[3:11:34.080 --> 3:11:39.080]  And based on what we've already seen from the previous events, I think Trump is absolutely correct.
[3:11:39.080 --> 3:11:43.080]  Motherfucker, you better look outside. You better look out on January 6th.
[3:11:43.080 --> 3:11:50.080]  Kick that fucking door open. Look down the street. It's going to be a million plus geeked up armed Americans.
[3:11:50.080 --> 3:12:04.080]  The time for games is over. The time for action is now. Where were you when history called? Where were you when you and your children's destiny and future was on the line?
[3:12:04.080 --> 3:12:10.080]  In that clip, you heard one of Trump supporters predict a red wedding, which is a pop culture reference to mass slaughter.
[3:12:10.080 --> 3:12:18.080]  But the point is that Trump's call to Washington reverberated powerfully and pervasively online.
[3:12:18.080 --> 3:12:26.080]  The committee has interviewed a former Twitter employee who explained the effects that Trump had on the Twitter platform.
[3:12:26.080 --> 3:12:32.080]  This employee was on the team responsible for platform and content moderation policies on Twitter.
[3:12:32.080 --> 3:12:41.080]  So here's the pedophile government with all of their evil coming out and all of it being exposed and they don't know what to do.
[3:12:41.080 --> 3:12:49.080]  And they cobbled together clips of Tim Poole and Alex Jones and a guest host on my show and try to say, see, they're evil.
[3:12:49.080 --> 3:12:54.080]  We've got to ban them. We've got to censor them. We've got to control them because they're going to protest elections.
[3:12:54.080 --> 3:13:02.080]  But I can show you clip after clip and you've all seen them of Democrats questioning the last few elections and pushing the very same procedures.
[3:13:02.080 --> 3:13:13.080]  But the good news is the poll numbers are in lowest ratings ever. Only a few hundred thousand people on all networks combined are watching this crap.
[3:13:13.080 --> 3:13:18.080]  In fact, polls show the average American's like, why did we do more?
[3:13:18.080 --> 3:13:23.080]  Well, I don't believe it overthrowing governments violently. I want to fix it peacefully.
[3:13:23.080 --> 3:13:30.080]  And in that lays the real danger. People are so angry at the power structure.
[3:13:30.080 --> 3:13:35.080]  That when it demonizes us, it only makes us better. And I'm somebody wanting peace.
[3:13:35.080 --> 3:13:43.080]  I'm somebody wanting to fix things politically and culturally. But these globalists don't get they've been rejected.
[3:13:43.080 --> 3:13:50.080]  The people are against them. And that's what Raskin and all the rest of them don't get is their time is over.
[3:13:50.080 --> 3:13:53.080]  Their blue cities are over. Their George Soros crap is over.
[3:13:53.080 --> 3:14:00.080]  Their New World Order pedophilia and Hunter Biden is over. And humanity is awake and angry.
[3:14:00.080 --> 3:14:07.080]  So that's my response to the January 6th Committee and the things they're doing trying to outlaw political dissent and so much more.
[3:14:07.080 --> 3:14:13.080]  All right, Wayne Allen Root is always powerful. He's about to take over the other side of this break.

[3:16:35.080 --> 3:16:46.080]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees who used it for its relaxing qualities.

[3:20:11.080 --> 3:20:23.080]  All right, Wayne Allen Roots, welcome to the Alex Jones show, hour number four. As you know, I always host on Tuesdays from 12 noon to one o'clock West Coast time.
[3:20:23.080 --> 3:20:29.080]  And it's great to be here. I'm here in Las Vegas, Nevada. You'll see a little different background just slightly.
[3:20:29.080 --> 3:20:37.080]  My home television and radio studio literally blew up. The computer that powers it all literally blew up.
[3:20:37.080 --> 3:20:43.080]  I'm talking about caught on fire. And we have to work fast. This just happened in the last couple hours.
[3:20:43.080 --> 3:20:55.080]  And we configured everything and instead of a $20,000 Fox News quality camera on me for all my TV work, we've now got an Apple laptop on me for all my TV work.
[3:20:55.080 --> 3:21:02.080]  I hope it looks okay. It's certainly not a $20,000 camera, but it's an Apple laptop that I travel with all over the United States.
[3:21:02.080 --> 3:21:09.080]  And I have speeches all over the country. And this is the camera. But we set it up. I've got earpiece. I've got microphone. I've got camera going.
[3:21:09.080 --> 3:21:14.080]  And instead of canceling my periods today on the show at the last second, I'm here with you. It's great.
[3:21:14.080 --> 3:21:20.080]  And I raised here, raised here because we had a big event in Las Vegas, Nevada.
[3:21:20.080 --> 3:21:32.080]  And it was put on by Sheriff Richard Mack. And it was put on by the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association of the United States.
[3:21:32.080 --> 3:21:38.080]  And he has brought with him sheriffs from all over the United States who believe the 2020 election was stolen.
[3:21:38.080 --> 3:21:44.080]  And Democrats are going to try and do it again. I know they're going to try and do it again. I can see it.
[3:21:44.080 --> 3:21:51.080]  You know, I've made thousands and thousands of predictions for the last seven years on national radio, Wayne Allyn Root,
[3:21:51.080 --> 3:21:58.080]  we're all not filtered on USA Radio Network. You can find it at root4america.com.
[3:21:58.080 --> 3:22:05.080]  My predictions have got to be the best record of hitting success-wise in the history of TV or radio.
[3:22:05.080 --> 3:22:12.080]  And by the way, I made a lot of these predictions on TV because for three years, I had the number one show in the number one time slot on Newsmax TV.
[3:22:12.080 --> 3:22:20.080]  Over 700 episodes. And every prediction I've made has come true except maybe five out of thousands of predictions.
[3:22:20.080 --> 3:22:28.080]  I must be batting 999. Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron have nothing on me. 999.99.
[3:22:28.080 --> 3:22:36.080]  And I'm telling you that anyone who thinks the Republican Party is going to win in November by massive landslide.
[3:22:36.080 --> 3:22:42.080]  And I think they would. If everything was fair, everybody hates Biden. Everyone despises Joe Biden.
[3:22:42.080 --> 3:22:49.080]  Matter of fact, if there were any Hispanic men left who don't hate Biden and support Trump, if there were any left who weren't like that,
[3:22:49.080 --> 3:22:53.080]  they're all on Trump's side. And I believe Trump will be the GOP nominee, by the way.
[3:22:53.080 --> 3:22:58.080]  He was just in Las Vegas. My good buddy, Donald Trump. I'm very proud. I was at his event on Friday.
[3:22:58.080 --> 3:23:03.080]  I was standing in the audience. I didn't expect anything other than to see him after the event and say hi to him.
[3:23:03.080 --> 3:23:10.080]  And Donald Trump announces the crowd. Here's our next U.S. Senator, Adam Laxalt. Here's our next Governor of Nevada, Joe Lombardo.
[3:23:10.080 --> 3:23:17.080]  And then he says, and in the audience with us, Wayne Allen Root, the radio star who has the most incredible show.
[3:23:17.080 --> 3:23:24.080]  And every single time I'm on it, I get in trouble. Wayne gets me in trouble. I love him. You're fantastic.
[3:23:24.080 --> 3:23:31.080]  We've been dear friends for so many years. That's an exact quote for the 45th President of the United States about yours truly.
[3:23:31.080 --> 3:23:38.080]  Thank you, President Trump. I love you too. And I love being remembered by him as the guy who always gets in trouble.
[3:23:38.080 --> 3:23:45.080]  But, you know, the latest polls show Hispanic men are 70, 30 in favor of Trump. They love as much as Moe,
[3:23:45.080 --> 3:23:51.080]  and they hate what Biden has done to the economy, the inflation, and the GDP is horrible, and they're going to lose their jobs.
[3:23:51.080 --> 3:23:56.080]  And even if they keep their jobs, you know, whatever they eat, their groceries, they're going out to eat,
[3:23:56.080 --> 3:24:03.080]  is cost more than they make. The average Hispanic male who's working in the United States of America can't take this inflation.
[3:24:03.080 --> 3:24:10.080]  So they're all on the Republican side now. And then, of course, Jill Biden went out and compared Hispanics to tacos.
[3:24:10.080 --> 3:24:21.080]  I kid you not. If you didn't see the scandal, she was at some Hispanic organization and made some sort of a comparison between Latinos and tacos.
[3:24:21.080 --> 3:24:30.080]  Oh, my God. This is what you're dealing with. These people are so inept and so old and so crotchety and feeble and grumpy.
[3:24:30.080 --> 3:24:38.080]  And, you know, how did they ever elect the President of the United States? They stole it. That's how they elected them. They stole it.
[3:24:38.080 --> 3:24:44.080]  So I opened my speech, they just, you know, in front of the peace officers, sheriffs at Peace Officers Association of the United States.
[3:24:44.080 --> 3:24:53.080]  And I said, you know, I've got a couple of quick personal stories because you're going to, you know, this entire event is devoted to the stolen election.
[3:24:53.080 --> 3:25:03.080]  And at the event here in Vegas that I just came from, Mike Lindell and also Catherine Engelbrecht and Greg Phillips of True the Vote.
[3:25:03.080 --> 3:25:11.080]  And quite a few other people whose lives are dedicated to voter fraud and exposing voter fraud and proving voter fraud.
[3:25:11.080 --> 3:25:20.080]  But I said, I have such a different angle. I'm not going to prove anything except that the election was stolen and I don't need any proof to know the election was stolen.
[3:25:20.080 --> 3:25:25.080]  I opened up by saying, you know, many of you in this audience, you're all fans of mine.
[3:25:25.080 --> 3:25:35.080]  I mean, there were 350 people in the room, big crowd, nice turnout, last minute event, 350 people, all patriots and all fans of Wayne Root we advertised and promoted it on my show.
[3:25:35.080 --> 3:25:41.080]  And they all came up to me when I, when I walked in the door, it was like the Red Sea parted for Moses.
[3:25:41.080 --> 3:25:48.080]  And I'm so proud and so honored that there's so many people that know me and appreciate what I do every day.
[3:25:48.080 --> 3:25:53.080]  Then I risk my life and my career every day on the Alex Jones show and on the Wayne Alleroo show.
[3:25:53.080 --> 3:25:56.080]  And I'm about to announce two of my own television shows.
[3:25:56.080 --> 3:26:01.080]  I'll make that announcement the next week and I'm getting back on TV again full time.
[3:26:01.080 --> 3:26:06.080]  And I risk my life every day with, with the homicidal maniacs who run the Biden administration,
[3:26:06.080 --> 3:26:16.080]  who I believe, you know, are looking to get rid of anybody who disagrees with them, destroy your life, destroy your career and who knows what else they're willing to do as time goes on.
[3:26:16.080 --> 3:26:24.080]  And so I'm so tickle-pink that people appreciate what I do that President Trump, the 45th President of the United States, appreciates what I do.
[3:26:24.080 --> 3:26:28.080]  It calls me a dear friend of many years and the guy who always gets in trouble.
[3:26:28.080 --> 3:26:34.080]  I'm honored to be the guy who always gets in trouble because that's how much my national radio show gets out there.
[3:26:34.080 --> 3:26:36.080]  Everybody sees it.
[3:26:36.080 --> 3:26:44.080]  And then I come on the Alex Jones show every Tuesday and I tell you what happened when I interviewed President Trump on a regular base on my national radio show.
[3:26:44.080 --> 3:26:52.080]  And the word gets out and President Trump realizes coming on my show is no different than being on Sean Hannity or Mark Levin.
[3:26:52.080 --> 3:26:58.080]  You know, because so many people on the left follow my show to hear what I'm saying.
[3:26:58.080 --> 3:27:03.080]  You wouldn't even believe the emails I get from people on the left who follow my show.
[3:27:03.080 --> 3:27:07.080]  In addition to millions on the right, they're watching every word I say.
[3:27:07.080 --> 3:27:18.080]  So I told the crowd today that before I ever became, you know, the famous political talk show host, I was a sports talk guy.
[3:27:18.080 --> 3:27:23.080]  And then the king of Vegas sports gambling, literally the king of Vegas sports gambling.
[3:27:23.080 --> 3:27:28.080]  I've got my own star, 180 pound grand star in the sidewalk in Las Vegas as the king of Vegas sports gambling.
[3:27:28.080 --> 3:27:32.080]  And I know everything about sports gambling and making a bet.
[3:27:32.080 --> 3:27:38.080]  And I bet a huge amount of money on Trump to win the 2020 election.
[3:27:38.080 --> 3:27:45.080]  And I told him about the only fixed football game that we know for sure in the history of the NFL.
[3:27:45.080 --> 3:27:49.080]  And we know it. We know it. It was called the Miracle in the Meadowlands.
[3:27:49.080 --> 3:27:54.080]  The date was November 19, 1978.
[3:27:54.080 --> 3:27:58.080]  And the Philadelphia Eagles were losing to the New York Giants.
[3:27:58.080 --> 3:28:04.080]  And the New York Giants, all they had to do was knee the ball with seconds to go in the games over and they win.
[3:28:04.080 --> 3:28:11.080]  And instead of knee it, they make this incredible, insane decision to hand off the football.
[3:28:11.080 --> 3:28:16.080]  No reason to. And the running back doesn't want it. He literally, you could see, doesn't want the ball.
[3:28:16.080 --> 3:28:19.080]  And it drops to the ground, to the astroturf.
[3:28:19.080 --> 3:28:22.080]  And then he doesn't jump on the fumble and the game would have been over.
[3:28:22.080 --> 3:28:25.080]  He lets it go. He lets it go.
[3:28:25.080 --> 3:28:31.080]  And the Philadelphia Eagles, Herm Edwards picks it up and runs for touchdown 27 yards and the Eagles win the game.
[3:28:31.080 --> 3:28:35.080]  It never should have happened. It was a fixed game. Everyone knows the game was rigged.
[3:28:35.080 --> 3:28:39.080]  The game was fixed. I want to compare that when we get back to the 2020 election.
[3:28:39.080 --> 3:28:45.080]  When you hear the comparison, you'll understand. It was rigged. It was fixed. It was stolen.
[3:28:45.080 --> 3:28:46.080]  I'll be right back.
[3:28:46.080 --> 3:29:10.080]  WayneAllerootFromAmerica.com, WayneRootedGmail.com.
[3:29:16.080 --> 3:29:19.080]  There's nowhere else really that does it like we do here. Thank you for that word.
[3:29:19.080 --> 3:29:24.080]  InfowarsStore.com, by the way, the products he mentions. InfowarsStore.com is where to get them, folks.
[3:29:24.080 --> 3:29:31.080]  And we do have the best supplements. I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information,
[3:29:31.080 --> 3:29:35.080]  we do the best with our supplements as well.
[3:29:35.080 --> 3:29:39.080]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula. Folks, this is a joke.
[3:29:39.080 --> 3:29:43.080]  I mean, we're giving this thing away. It's 75% off. By the way, it works for me.
[3:29:43.080 --> 3:29:48.080]  In case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula is working for me.
[3:29:48.080 --> 3:29:54.080]  Quite well, I might add. Quite well. My barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.

[3:33:20.080 --> 3:33:26.080]  The first book, which came out a few months ago, is my Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book
[3:33:26.080 --> 3:33:32.080]  about all the companies you need to boycott who are against patriots, against conservatives,
[3:33:32.080 --> 3:33:36.080]  treat us like crap, spit in our face, you know, what's that famous saying?
[3:33:36.080 --> 3:33:39.080]  Pee on our leg and tell us it's raining.
[3:33:39.080 --> 3:33:47.080]  And offend us on a daily basis by supporting horrible liberal socialist Marxist communist transgender causes
[3:33:47.080 --> 3:33:48.080]  and how we should boycott them.
[3:33:48.080 --> 3:33:52.080]  And I give you all the information, all the contact information you need to boycott them,
[3:33:52.080 --> 3:33:57.080]  their name of the CEO, names of the board of directors, and their phone number and their email address.
[3:33:57.080 --> 3:33:59.080]  All of that is in the book.
[3:33:59.080 --> 3:34:02.080]  So you can go after the top 116 companies in America that we got to boycott.
[3:34:02.080 --> 3:34:07.080]  And soon you can find it at Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and of course you can look for more about it at my website,

[3:34:43.080 --> 3:34:44.080]  Love you, Alex.
[3:34:44.080 --> 3:34:45.080]  Thank you for having me on.
[3:34:45.080 --> 3:34:54.080]  So I want to get back to my story that I told to start this big event with the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association in Las Vegas.
[3:34:54.080 --> 3:35:00.080]  It's going on right now and some great guests, including Michael and Del, will be there live in a little while.
[3:35:00.080 --> 3:35:07.080]  And through the vote, Ingolstadt and Phillips will be there and a lot of sheriffs from around the country.
[3:35:07.080 --> 3:35:11.080]  And I was lucky enough and honored to be the opening speaker of the entire event.
[3:35:11.080 --> 3:35:13.080]  And welcome everybody to the event.
[3:35:13.080 --> 3:35:16.080]  And I wrote my notes on my little iPhone here.
[3:35:16.080 --> 3:35:18.080]  It's how life goes now, right?
[3:35:18.080 --> 3:35:19.080]  You don't need speeches.
[3:35:19.080 --> 3:35:20.080]  You don't need pads.
[3:35:20.080 --> 3:35:23.080]  All you need is an iPad in front of you or an iPhone in front of you.
[3:35:23.080 --> 3:35:24.080]  And that's it.
[3:35:24.080 --> 3:35:25.080]  You're done.
[3:35:25.080 --> 3:35:32.080]  So I told the story of the great mistake at the Meadowlands, the fixed game, the great fumble.
[3:35:32.080 --> 3:35:35.080]  Sometimes it's called the miracle at the Meadowlands.
[3:35:35.080 --> 3:35:38.080]  And the New York Giants just had to knee the ball to win the game.
[3:35:38.080 --> 3:35:41.080]  This was on September 19, 1978.
[3:35:41.080 --> 3:35:49.080]  It is absolutely regarded by sports experts and sports betters as the only absolutely fixed game in the history of the NFL.
[3:35:49.080 --> 3:35:53.080]  And there may have been a lot of other fixed games, but this is the only one we know about.
[3:35:53.080 --> 3:35:54.080]  But can we prove it?
[3:35:54.080 --> 3:35:55.080]  No.
[3:35:55.080 --> 3:35:57.080]  Nobody's proved it, but we all know.
[3:35:57.080 --> 3:36:00.080]  Everyone in Vegas knows the game was fixed.
[3:36:00.080 --> 3:36:04.080]  The quarterback handed the ball off with seconds to go, knowing the game was over.
[3:36:04.080 --> 3:36:05.080]  We'd won.
[3:36:05.080 --> 3:36:06.080]  The New York Giants had won.
[3:36:06.080 --> 3:36:08.080]  I was a New Yorker in those days.
[3:36:08.080 --> 3:36:09.080]  Had won.
[3:36:09.080 --> 3:36:10.080]  All they had to do was knee the ball.
[3:36:10.080 --> 3:36:11.080]  The game was over.
[3:36:11.080 --> 3:36:13.080]  And instead they decided to hand off.
[3:36:13.080 --> 3:36:15.080]  And the running back says, no boss.
[3:36:15.080 --> 3:36:16.080]  I don't want the ball.
[3:36:16.080 --> 3:36:17.080]  It falls on the ground.
[3:36:17.080 --> 3:36:19.080]  And he doesn't even jump on it.
[3:36:19.080 --> 3:36:21.080]  And the Eagles jump on the ball.
[3:36:21.080 --> 3:36:23.080]  Her Edwards picks it up, defends it back.
[3:36:23.080 --> 3:36:25.080]  Now known as a college football coach.
[3:36:25.080 --> 3:36:27.080]  And he runs it for a touchdown.
[3:36:27.080 --> 3:36:28.080]  And the Eagles win.
[3:36:28.080 --> 3:36:29.080]  The game was fixed.
[3:36:29.080 --> 3:36:32.080]  The bookmakers needed the Eagles to win.
[3:36:32.080 --> 3:36:37.080]  Someone told the New York Giants players, you fumble that ball, let them pick it up.
[3:36:37.080 --> 3:36:39.080]  Running for a touchdown, you're going to lose this game.
[3:36:39.080 --> 3:36:41.080]  Everybody knows that.
[3:36:41.080 --> 3:36:44.080]  But I can't prove it, but everybody knows it.
[3:36:44.080 --> 3:36:46.080]  There's no one who doesn't know it.
[3:36:46.080 --> 3:36:48.080]  The miracle in the Meadowlands.
[3:36:48.080 --> 3:36:50.080]  And I want to tell you what happened afterwards.
[3:36:50.080 --> 3:36:52.080]  That's just like the 2020 election.
[3:36:52.080 --> 3:36:57.080]  So a couple of years later, let's see, 1978, this happened.
[3:36:57.080 --> 3:36:59.080]  1989.
[3:36:59.080 --> 3:37:03.080]  So 11 years later, or maybe it was 1990, 12 years later.
[3:37:03.080 --> 3:37:07.080]  A famous sports journalist named Dan Moldia.
[3:37:07.080 --> 3:37:09.080]  I believe it was his name.
[3:37:09.080 --> 3:37:11.080]  Dan Moldia.
[3:37:11.080 --> 3:37:12.080]  I got it right.
[3:37:12.080 --> 3:37:19.080]  Dan Moldia had written many bestselling books and was super credible and well-regarded in the sports world.
[3:37:19.080 --> 3:37:25.080]  And was constantly on every single sports network in America, on TV and on radio,
[3:37:25.080 --> 3:37:30.080]  on every topic you could name, talking about sports and in particular, the NFL.
[3:37:30.080 --> 3:37:37.080]  And then he decided to write a book about the NFL and the mafia and fixed football games.
[3:37:37.080 --> 3:37:42.080]  And I booked them at the time, 1989, 1990, 1991.
[3:37:42.080 --> 3:37:50.080]  I was the lead anchorman and host of five shows for CNBC, which was called Financial News Network.
[3:37:50.080 --> 3:37:52.080]  And I was a kid.
[3:37:52.080 --> 3:37:56.080]  I was 26, 27, 28 years old and hosting five shows on national TV.
[3:37:56.080 --> 3:38:00.080]  And all of them were sports gambling related.
[3:38:00.080 --> 3:38:05.080]  And on one of them, my partner was the famous Jimmy the Greek Snyder.
[3:38:05.080 --> 3:38:10.080]  Me and Jimmy the Greek, Wayne the Jew and Jimmy the Greek, starring on national TV together,
[3:38:10.080 --> 3:38:13.080]  talking gambling and predicting football games, right?
[3:38:13.080 --> 3:38:18.080]  And I had this huge audience of fans, probably as strong as I've got now in conservative politics.
[3:38:18.080 --> 3:38:21.080]  But then they loved me because of sports gambling.
[3:38:21.080 --> 3:38:29.080]  And so I'm hosting five shows and I booked Dan Moldia as my guest to talk about his book,
[3:38:29.080 --> 3:38:34.080]  which literally lays out why some games were fixed by the mafia in the NFL.
[3:38:34.080 --> 3:38:36.080]  Over the last century.
[3:38:36.080 --> 3:38:43.080]  And the one story that the centerpiece of his book is this 1978 game, The Miracle of the Meadowlands,
[3:38:43.080 --> 3:38:49.080]  that absolutely every single mafia figure he interviewed said was a fixed game by the mafia.
[3:38:49.080 --> 3:38:51.080]  Fixed NFL game.
[3:38:51.080 --> 3:38:53.080]  And I booked it for my show.
[3:38:53.080 --> 3:38:57.080]  And at the last minute, the CEO of my network calls me up.
[3:38:57.080 --> 3:38:58.080]  He never called me.
[3:38:58.080 --> 3:39:00.080]  Why does the CEO call me before a show?
[3:39:00.080 --> 3:39:05.080]  And the CEO says, Wayne, can't have him on the show.
[3:39:05.080 --> 3:39:08.080]  We're canceling his appearance at F&N.
[3:39:08.080 --> 3:39:09.080]  And I was like, what?
[3:39:09.080 --> 3:39:10.080]  Can't have him on the show.
[3:39:10.080 --> 3:39:11.080]  Why?
[3:39:11.080 --> 3:39:17.080]  Because the NFL is called and he's not allowed to be booked or we won't get any cooperation from the NFL ever again.
[3:39:17.080 --> 3:39:24.080]  And we won't have the right to show NFL highlights ever again after the games on your show.
[3:39:24.080 --> 3:39:26.080]  So you got canceled Dan Moldias.
[3:39:26.080 --> 3:39:27.080]  I called him and I said, you can't come on.
[3:39:27.080 --> 3:39:28.080]  I'm sorry.
[3:39:28.080 --> 3:39:29.080]  You've been canceled.
[3:39:29.080 --> 3:39:30.080]  You've been banned.
[3:39:30.080 --> 3:39:43.080]  And then he told me a story that his book, he'd written like 10 bestselling sports books and he was on every show in America to promote them until he wrote the book about the mafia and fixed rigged NFL games.
[3:39:43.080 --> 3:39:48.080]  And in particular, that New York Giants Philadelphia game in 1978 of the Meadowlands.
[3:39:48.080 --> 3:39:51.080]  That's absolutely fixed by the mafia.
[3:39:51.080 --> 3:39:53.080]  NFL game fixed by the mafia.
[3:39:53.080 --> 3:39:54.080]  We all know it.
[3:39:54.080 --> 3:39:56.080]  Dan Moldia know it.
[3:39:56.080 --> 3:39:57.080]  Knew it.
[3:39:57.080 --> 3:40:02.080]  And from the moment he wrote that book, he was canceled everywhere.
[3:40:02.080 --> 3:40:06.080]  Canceled culture existed in 1989, 1990.
[3:40:06.080 --> 3:40:11.080]  And he was banned from being on TV to promote the book and the book died.
[3:40:11.080 --> 3:40:15.080]  That's what happens when you go against the NFL.
[3:40:15.080 --> 3:40:17.080]  So now let's forward.
[3:40:17.080 --> 3:40:19.080]  Fast forward to 2020.
[3:40:19.080 --> 3:40:27.080]  And I told everybody in that room today that I made a gigantic bet on President Trump to win the 2020 election.
[3:40:27.080 --> 3:40:37.080]  And that I know from past history over the last 50 years that on the night of an election, a presidential election, the betters never are wrong.
[3:40:37.080 --> 3:40:50.080]  When they're making live bets as the election results come in, they're so smart because they're betting their own money, hundreds of thousands of dollars each, the biggest betters in the world are betting a million dollars that Trump's going to win or Biden's going to win.
[3:40:50.080 --> 3:40:52.080]  But not before the election.
[3:40:52.080 --> 3:40:56.080]  I'm talking about the night of the election with live results come in.
[3:40:56.080 --> 3:41:03.080]  Texas is in, Florida is in, Ohio is in, and people are betting 100,000, 200,000, a million dollars.
[3:41:03.080 --> 3:41:15.080]  I've got a big bet on the election and I'm watching my computer screens and Trump goes from an underdog when the night began to Biden slide underdog to a slight to even money to a slight favorite to a large favorite.
[3:41:15.080 --> 3:41:23.080]  Then to a two to one favorite, three to one favorite, four to one favorite, five to one favorite, six to one favorite, seven to one favorite, eight to one favorite.
[3:41:23.080 --> 3:41:24.080]  You know what that means?
[3:41:24.080 --> 3:41:29.080]  The odds are astronomical that Trump has just won a landslide and electoral landslide.
[3:41:29.080 --> 3:41:38.080]  People are watching the results in lifetime and they know that Trump has won a landslide at midnight East Coast time, nine o'clock where I am in Las Vegas.
[3:41:38.080 --> 3:41:54.080]  And at that exact moment that I'm counting my money, that we've won the election, that every better in the world watching a lifetime election results, knows, recognizes, and is willing to risk their money, that Trump has won by a landslide and it's not even close and it's over.
[3:41:54.080 --> 3:41:58.080]  Five states announced they're stopping the count.
[3:41:58.080 --> 3:42:05.080]  And those five states were the difference between Trump winning by a landslide or losing by a large margin if you flip on the other way.
[3:42:05.080 --> 3:42:17.080]  And suddenly when you wake up in the morning, Trump has lost leads of 100,000 in Georgia, 100,000 in Wisconsin, 300,000 in Michigan, 800,000 in Pennsylvania, and they didn't stop counting.
[3:42:17.080 --> 3:42:34.080]  They kept counting through the night and they found drops of 100,000 votes and more in favor of Biden to zero for Trump, wiped out Trump's lead, and suddenly Trump's a two to one underdog when I wake up in the morning and that's a guarantee almost that he's going to lose.
[3:42:34.080 --> 3:42:37.080]  He was an eight to one favorite while they were watching the returns come in.
[3:42:37.080 --> 3:42:40.080]  Now he's a two to one underdog and he goes on to lose.

[3:46:19.080 --> 3:46:31.080]  there krill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn burps and I'm sorry you want something like this you don't get stuff for free the krill is hallucinogenic it's so good in my view I'm not a medical statement here but let me tell you something I eat five
[3:46:31.080 --> 3:46:51.080]  capitalets of krill oil before I go to bed I'm seeing Santa Claus that night so your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is so we don't make a big profit off of it but you know as I just obsessed with whatever the best is we've got I just can't lie to you I just can't do it
[3:46:51.080 --> 3:47:04.080]  infowarstore.com
[3:47:04.080 --> 3:47:24.080]  All right wait I'll root back live forget this the last segment how did that happen well Alex ate up the first 15 minutes or so of the hours I only got about 40 minutes or so this hour has gone so fast it's
[3:47:24.080 --> 3:47:35.080]  insane people say to me Wayne how do you do you know what people came up to me at the peace officers sheriffs and peace officers association event that I opened up this morning in Las Vegas they said here's what almost every person in the room said
[3:47:35.080 --> 3:47:53.080]  and when the people were talking everyone around them was nodding their head Wayne you three hours a day you tell us how America's imploding and America's going to hell and America's being destroyed and it's a communist attack but you do it in such a positive way we all feel hope
[3:47:53.080 --> 3:48:08.080]  and I was so proud I swear I almost started crying I was so proud because somehow I'm able to explain to people how bad things are how precarious things are but they're taking it in a positive way because they love my positivity and I was worried that
[3:48:08.080 --> 3:48:24.080]  I'm making people depressed by telling the truth about the COVID attack and the COVID vaccines and China in charge of the White House and the open borders and the green energy disaster and the list goes on and on and on and the COVID vaccine deaths and the stolen
[3:48:24.080 --> 3:48:40.080]  election I mean you could literally want to kill yourself and every person in the room came up to me to hug me and thank me that I uplift them and make them feel good while I'm telling the raw truth that's so depressing and you know what I said to all of my
[3:48:40.080 --> 3:48:54.080]  open my speech by telling the story that so many people said this to me and I felt like I had to open the speech by saying this and the reason I'm able to stay and they said I don't know how you stay so positive I said the reason I'm able to stay so
[3:48:54.080 --> 3:49:12.080]  positive is because of my incredibly strong roots excuse the pun my belief in God I love God I believe in God I believe in Jesus Christ as my savior I'm a Jew to Christ as my savior 32 years ago going on 33 years
[3:49:12.080 --> 3:49:30.080]  now and I love God I love Jesus and I believe in the end God always wins it doesn't matter how bad things are God will win right is might in the end God will smite the evil bad guys the devil is in the
[3:49:30.080 --> 3:49:44.080]  Democrat Party I have no doubt about that the Democrat Party is now run by Satan and in the end we will win but that doesn't mean the battle won't be brutal that doesn't mean people won't die along the way that doesn't
[3:49:44.080 --> 3:50:00.080]  mean people would start to death and become homeless along the way but sometime in the future a year for now two years for now five years for now 10 years for now I have no doubt we will win America will win American exceptionalism will win
[3:50:00.080 --> 3:50:16.080]  capitalism will win God will win the devil never wins we will beat the devil so that's why I'm able to maintain positivity in the face of the horrible things Democrats are doing to our country destroying our country
[3:50:16.080 --> 3:50:34.080]  destroying everything I believe in next week I can't wait for next Tuesday on the Alex Jones show because next week I jotted down the 10 greatest crimes and scams ever perpetrated by government the Democrats in the mainstream media in history
[3:50:34.080 --> 3:50:49.080]  and all ten are in the last two years and I can't wait to give you the list that'll be my story next week but I want to end this hour by telling you my story of what I believe is going to happen in November
[3:50:49.080 --> 3:51:05.080]  because I started to say that the beginning of this hour or at least the beginning of my part of this hour Alex took the first 15 I started about quarter after 20 after and so what I started to say I don't believe that everything is fair and equal and
[3:51:05.080 --> 3:51:25.080]  honesty and integrity in the election system it's not there they're going to try and cheat us again in November just like they did in 2020 I think I laid out the case pretty strongly on this show why it was a stolen election again without real proof just like I have no proof that that game in 1978 was rigged and fixed
[3:51:25.080 --> 3:51:41.080]  and stolen at the metal lands but we all know it every gambler in Vegas knows it I feel like I should be I should be going make my let's go let's go six rounds and every liberal in America but listen we know the game was fixed and I know 2020 was fixed
[3:51:41.080 --> 3:51:57.080]  in every muscle in my body in every vein in my body in every capillary my body in every cell in my brain I know the 2020 election was fixed and I watched it happen in real time and then just like the metal lands game
[3:51:57.080 --> 3:52:15.080]  right Dan Maldia wrote about fixed games with the mafia and the NFL and they banned him banished him from television that was the end of Dan Maldia and when I wrote about the fixed election on Twitter they banned me for life gone
[3:52:15.080 --> 3:52:33.080]  I was adding 30,000 fans a month on my account at Twitter I was doing no promotion I don't know I don't know where they came from they found me they knew during the election of 2020 wait it was on fire what do I say on my show the root the root the root is on fire
[3:52:33.080 --> 3:52:51.080]  and when I get going man I'm like a Christian preacher and I was on fire I'm an evangelical evangelical speaker and evangelical minister and spokesman for conservatism and capitalism you know there are those who call me the capitalist evangelist
[3:52:51.080 --> 3:53:10.080]  I'm an evangelist for hope that things are going to be okay that God is on our side and so when I get going I really ago I was getting 30,000 fans a month and they banned me for life they had to stop me and by the way I'm not going to name the name on TV
[3:53:10.080 --> 3:53:28.080]  but right now I'm being banned and censored by a company that sends out all of my email blasts to my tens of thousands of fans I send out my columns I send out my videos I send out a notice of when Wayne root will be giving a speech somewhere in the United States
[3:53:28.080 --> 3:53:51.080]  and up until maybe nine months ago everything I sent out had the highest rate of clicks anybody had ever seen I would send something out and like 47% who got it would click on it and open it and then you have the second click rate like 45% would click on that and go to my story
[3:53:51.080 --> 3:54:09.080]  no one's ever seen numbers that high now all of a sudden something happened nine months ago now everything I send out 2% open it and 0.1% click on it and I hired a top investigator and he just came back with the results
[3:54:09.080 --> 3:54:27.080]  he said Wayne there are email systems in America that are automatically set to reject everything with Wayne Roots name on it so that's why no one's getting it it's automatically put into spam or even sent into cyberspace without ever even going into their spam account
[3:54:27.080 --> 3:54:43.080]  nobody who joins your list can even get your stuff on certain systems that's why so few are clicking folks this is an attack on censorship on free speech the founding fathers made the very first plank of America
[3:54:43.080 --> 3:55:02.080]  number one in the Constitution free speech number two own a gun to protect yourself from government and both are under massive attack by liberals who want to destroy us don't forget what happened to my Jewish people
[3:55:02.080 --> 3:55:19.080]  the first thing Hitler did before he killed the Jews is he banned Jews from gun ownership in 1938 before he ever got to the Holocaust he said no Jew could own a gun we couldn't even fight back in self defense
[3:55:19.080 --> 3:55:37.080]  this is what's going on Michael Moore that horrible liberal piece of human fat garbage Michael Moore he came out with some sort of a new constitutional plank yesterday that bans gun ownership instead of saying everyone has a right to own a gun
[3:55:37.080 --> 3:55:55.080]  it says it changes the Constitution to say everybody has a right to be protected from being killed by a gun so nobody can own a gun can you imagine the mental madness of liberals the evil of liberals Satan is in charge of liberals
[3:55:55.080 --> 3:56:17.080]  a Jew turned born again Christian evangelical Christian is telling you that Satan is in charge of the Democrat Party so all I could tell you is I believe they will not go quietly in the midterms if things were fair we win 80 to 100 seats in the greatest landslide ever seen in history
[3:56:17.080 --> 3:56:35.080]  but I'm a tea leaf reader and everything I predict on radio and TV turns true by September October our nation will be flooded with COVID they're bringing COVID back right now and they're starting to make you hysterical right now about COVID and monkeypox
[3:56:35.080 --> 3:56:53.080]  they'll probably combine it's going to be called monkey COVID and it's going to take over the world and the United States will have elections with nothing but mail in ballots and mail in ballots by the millions and millions with no voter ID and they're going to steal another election
[3:56:53.080 --> 3:57:09.080]  what's the Republican Party doing about it nothing zero and by the way Joe Biden will be replaced before the midterms there's another prediction by me because if you replace them after the midterms and you move Kamala up to president who's your vice president
[3:57:09.080 --> 3:57:23.080]  if it's a Republican Congress they won't ratify the vice president confirm the vice president but so you've got to do it while you have a Democrat majority so they're going to get rid of Biden before the election move Kamala to president then force her out before 2024
[3:57:23.080 --> 3:57:43.080]  and the whoever the vice president is will be the incumbent president running against Trump in 2024 either Hillary, Michelle Obama or maybe Mayor Pete my predictions you watch Wayne all route route for America Wayne root at gmail dot com root for America dot com see you next week
[3:57:43.080 --> 3:58:01.080]  there is nothing there is no more epitome of free speech than right here and that's what people recognize and resonate with and as word said you're not going to find a better place for information you might not agree with everything
