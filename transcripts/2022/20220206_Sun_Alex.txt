[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[00:10.000 --> 00:17.000]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:17.000 --> 00:42.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:42.000 --> 00:47.000]  China's cyber threat is greater than any other nation.
[00:47.000 --> 00:54.000]  China's hackers, their hacking program is greater than every other major country combined.
[00:54.000 --> 01:02.000]  The FBI director has come out and discovered a giant new threat that's blown him away.
[01:02.000 --> 01:05.000]  You came back to the government, you've been in the Justice Department before,
[01:05.000 --> 01:11.000]  and when you came back as FBI director, were you surprised at the scale of Chinese spy?
[01:11.000 --> 01:13.000]  You know, it's a good question.
[01:13.000 --> 01:18.000]  I obviously had worked on a lot of this before when I was assistant attorney general.
[01:18.000 --> 01:28.000]  The counter espionage section reported up to me, so I thought I knew a lot about the Chinese espionage campaign and theft campaign.
[01:28.000 --> 01:34.000]  But maybe more than any other threat I've seen since I've come back into government, back into law enforcement in this role,
[01:34.000 --> 01:36.000]  this one blew me away.
[01:36.000 --> 01:40.000]  And I'm not the kind of guy that uses words like blown away easily.
[01:40.000 --> 01:45.000]  Kind of like the FBI until the mid-1950s told Congress that Makosa Nostra,
[01:45.000 --> 01:51.000]  an organized crime by the Italians, did not exist.
[01:51.000 --> 01:57.000]  Certain people may find out certain things which you might not want to mention.
[01:57.000 --> 01:59.000]  Sorry you said that.
[01:59.000 --> 02:01.000]  I'm sorry it had to be said.
[02:01.000 --> 02:05.000]  Well, now they tell us Chinese spies don't exist.
[02:05.000 --> 02:13.000]  Even though they basically took over Hollywood, took over the Democratic Party, put their operatives in as the managers of senators and members of the House.
[02:13.000 --> 02:20.000]  But now because George Soros said that China and the Communist are bad because he's God.
[02:20.000 --> 02:30.000]  And Xi Jinping's guilty secret is bound to be revealed either during the Winter Olympics or soon thereafter.
[02:30.000 --> 02:39.000]  Now the FBI is allowed to admit it exists because Xi Jinping for all of his evil and all of his corruption has decided to not have forced abortion
[02:39.000 --> 02:45.000]  and has decided to tell people to have three children and has decided to be proud of being Chinese and not wanting to destroy his country.
[02:45.000 --> 02:51.000]  And so because he did that and it's not giving George Soros his sacrament of dead babies,
[02:51.000 --> 02:57.000]  well now George Soros's minion has come out and discovered the Chinese Communist threat.
[02:57.000 --> 03:02.000]  It's like discovering the moon when you're 50 years old or something.
[03:02.000 --> 03:08.000]  You've said recently that the Chinese probably have the data of every American adult that's stolen.
[03:08.000 --> 03:13.000]  Why should that matter? Why should I care if the Chinese have my personal data?
[03:13.000 --> 03:27.000]  Well, China's government is engaged in an effort to both at home and abroad to engage in monitoring, surveillance, espionage and other kinds of targeting.
[03:27.000 --> 03:32.000]  And the information, the data that they steal helps them advance those efforts.
[03:32.000 --> 03:41.000]  And so back in China you might see that reflected in things like social credit scores and eavesdropping and other forms of oppression.
[03:41.000 --> 03:48.000]  But part of the problem is that they're exporting parts of that police state here in the United States.
[03:48.000 --> 03:54.000]  FBI Director reveals the one threat of the U.S. that has blown him away.
[03:54.000 --> 04:03.000]  But wait a minute, he just said two years ago and a year ago that white supremacy is the most lethal threat in America, says the FBI Director, Ann Biden.
[04:03.000 --> 04:11.000]  And we won't ignore what our intelligence agencies have determined to be the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today.
[04:11.000 --> 04:14.000]  White supremacy is terrorism.
[04:14.000 --> 04:31.000]  And I will say that a majority of the domestic terrorism cases that we've investigated are motivated by some version of what you might call white supremacist violence.
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.000]  But it includes other things as well.
[04:33.000 --> 04:35.000]  We hear all about the white supremacist, they're the number one threat.
[04:35.000 --> 04:41.000]  Not the Mexican drug cartels, not MS-13, not the communist Chinese, not radical Islam.
[04:41.000 --> 04:47.000]  No, white people are inherently evil and white people are inherently bad.
[04:47.000 --> 04:49.000]  And being white is inherently a bad thing.
[04:49.000 --> 04:55.000]  You see that taught the schools, taught everywhere by the Marxist-Leninist leftists.
[04:55.000 --> 05:00.000]  That are using that as their divide and conquer strategy.
[05:00.000 --> 05:10.000]  For only 72 hours, our groundbreaking course that helps you break free of the globalist mind control matrix, Reset Wars.

[06:23.000 --> 06:28.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Sunday, February 6th.
[06:28.000 --> 06:34.000]  The year is 2022 and all hell is literally breaking loose around the world.
[06:34.000 --> 06:35.000]  So strap yourselves in.
[06:35.000 --> 06:40.000]  I want to thank you all so much for joining us this evening.
[06:40.000 --> 06:43.000]  Let me just go through the news we're going to be covering here.
[06:43.000 --> 06:47.000]  I'm going to be hosting four hours tonight, not just the regular Sunday edition.
[06:47.000 --> 06:51.000]  Alex Jones, 4 to 6 PM that we've been doing for 16 years on this flight.
[06:51.000 --> 06:54.000]  Unless you're syndicated during the weekdays, 11 AM to 3 PM central.
[06:54.000 --> 06:58.000]  But of course we have Sunday Live that Owen Schreuer usually hosts.
[06:58.000 --> 07:01.000]  But I wanted to host tonight because I've got so much news to cover.
[07:01.000 --> 07:05.000]  So I'll be here 4 to 8 PM central standard time.
[07:05.000 --> 07:09.000]  And I'll be back 11 AM central tomorrow in this chair, Lord willing,
[07:09.000 --> 07:11.000]  because the times are so important.
[07:11.000 --> 07:16.000]  Okay, first off, you all know what happened Friday afternoon or you should probably.
[07:16.000 --> 07:22.000]  And that is Bloomberg put out the headline that Russia had attacked Ukraine.
[07:22.000 --> 07:27.000]  And they had all their reporting ready for what then supposedly unfolded.
[07:27.000 --> 07:30.000]  They did this before the last two Iraq wars as well.
[07:30.000 --> 07:32.000]  This is all part of a scythe.
[07:32.000 --> 07:35.000]  I'll be getting more into it today.
[07:35.000 --> 07:43.000]  But the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said the new name for fake news should be Bloomberg.
[07:43.000 --> 07:48.000]  I absolutely agree. And here's a shot of it with the headline top story.
[07:48.000 --> 07:52.000]  Russia invades Ukraine.
[07:52.000 --> 07:56.000]  The truth is the West is run by total globalist criminals.
[07:56.000 --> 07:58.000]  They have destabilized Eastern Europe.
[07:58.000 --> 08:03.000]  They are moving massive amounts of high tech, class A weapons,
[08:03.000 --> 08:09.000]  anti aircraft, anti personnel, anti tank weapons in.
[08:09.000 --> 08:15.000]  And they have started a proxy war with Russia as the midterm election.
[08:15.000 --> 08:20.000]  October surprise come early for the puppet president, Joe Biden.
[08:20.000 --> 08:28.000]  And so now they're not just going to blow up some third world Muslim country that can't fight back as a political distraction.
[08:28.000 --> 08:31.000]  While they open the borders up to those very Muslims, once they're pissed off at us,
[08:31.000 --> 08:36.000]  all part of the Gaelian dialectic and problem reaction solution and the great reset replacement migration.
[08:36.000 --> 08:42.000]  No, they're going to attack the second most powerful nuclear power in the world on their own turf.
[08:42.000 --> 08:45.000]  What a wonderful, wonderful idea.
[08:45.000 --> 08:51.000]  Bloomberg had fake headline Russia invades Ukraine on homepage for 30 minutes.
[08:51.000 --> 08:54.000]  They'll be drilling more into this.
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.000]  And Bloomberg said they're getting ready for war.
[08:56.000 --> 08:59.000]  And that it was just an accident because they were preparing for war.
[08:59.000 --> 09:01.000]  We prepare headlines for many scenarios.
[09:01.000 --> 09:06.000]  And the headline Russia invades Ukraine was inadvertently published around 4 p.m. today on our website.
[09:06.000 --> 09:07.000]  We deeply regret the error.
[09:07.000 --> 09:13.000]  That headline has been removed and we are investigating the cause.
[09:13.000 --> 09:20.000]  You know, back when I was a little more naive in 2008, I got up one morning at about 6.30 in the morning,
[09:20.000 --> 09:25.000]  went in, got some coffee, turned on my desktop big screen computer.
[09:25.000 --> 09:34.000]  And there was the headline on Drudge and everywhere else that was coming from CNN that Russia had invaded Georgia.
[09:34.000 --> 09:37.000]  And I jumped the shower real quick, jumped the car, drove in.
[09:37.000 --> 09:43.000]  By the time I got to work at about 9 o'clock, I was checking foreign news channels, including German and others.
[09:43.000 --> 09:50.000]  They were reporting, actually, well, the Russians got attacked on their border in Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and then they came in.
[09:50.000 --> 09:56.000]  And that was all true, but it didn't matter. Our media said that Russia had attacked Georgia.
[09:56.000 --> 10:03.000]  So if you follow the past actions of the globalist, it looks to me like they're just getting ready to launch a larger war against the Russians
[10:03.000 --> 10:09.000]  and try to take back some of the areas that the Russians took in 2014 on their border.
[10:09.000 --> 10:16.000]  And, of course, their main pipeline and main Black Sea base there strategically in southern Ukraine.
[10:16.000 --> 10:24.000]  And so if the Russians then dare defend themselves, the West is going to say, oh, it's a false flag.
[10:24.000 --> 10:30.000]  The Russians attacked themselves, and we never really attacked them and started a war.
[10:30.000 --> 10:36.000]  And then they get the provocation they want with the Russians that the West has been pushing so hard but can blame them.
[10:36.000 --> 10:46.000]  Just like Gulf of Tonkin, 1964 to officially launch a larger conflict, a police action, as they called it, in Vietnam,
[10:46.000 --> 10:51.000]  declassified 2004 that it was a staged operation by the Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara.
[10:51.000 --> 11:01.000]  And they released that same year because it was many, many decades after that on the anniversary, 2004, back to 1964,
[11:01.000 --> 11:10.000]  I do the math, that's 40 years, and they said right there on record and released the tapes on C-SPAN of,
[11:10.000 --> 11:16.000]  and I say tapes because you can hear it loop whenever he's talking, and then he'll have good audio and then bad audio
[11:16.000 --> 11:26.000]  because the tape's so old and warped, they were recording, and LBJ is down in this Texas ranch outside Austin in Johnson City.
[11:26.000 --> 11:31.000]  And there he is telling McNamara, okay, what's going on? And McNamara gives him the orders and says,
[11:31.000 --> 11:37.000]  you'll hear the news in about five hours, we're going to say we were attacked, and then he tells him how to officially put the story out.
[11:37.000 --> 11:43.000]  So that's what they're getting ready for, that's what they're doing, it's incredibly dangerous, it's incredibly bad.
[11:43.000 --> 11:52.000]  And Tucker Carlson on Friday did a really great job of laying this all out, so I don't normally air his whole monologue,
[11:52.000 --> 12:04.000]  but we're going to do it today because he did such a great job laying out what happened in that huge fiasco on Thursday at the State Department
[12:04.000 --> 12:10.000]  where the CIA operative, well known for lying about everything you can imagine, including there's no way Kabul will fall
[12:10.000 --> 12:18.000]  and there's no way the Taliban will take it over days before it happened, deer in the headlights or weasel in the spotlight,
[12:18.000 --> 12:29.000]  the little globalist anti-American new world order operative said, just take my word for it, it's true, they are going to stage a false flag,
[12:29.000 --> 12:36.000]  complete with fake movie productions, meaning anything Russians show they're going to say is a fake production.
[12:36.000 --> 12:43.000]  When it was the white helmets and the blue helmets and the UN got caught along with a bunch of the Islamics in serious staging chemical attacks
[12:43.000 --> 12:50.000]  on Assad, which later came out were staged and were fake, and the little boy that was supposedly dying from the nerve gas,
[12:50.000 --> 12:56.000]  he went on TV and said it was all fake and they paid his dad to have him do it.
[12:56.000 --> 13:00.000]  Remember the kids are doing this and they may stop and look and say, do I keep going?
[13:00.000 --> 13:01.000]  They go, yeah.
[13:01.000 --> 13:05.000]  I mean, all of that, ladies and gentlemen, is what the globalists do.
[13:05.000 --> 13:07.000]  Could the Russian stage a false flag?
[13:07.000 --> 13:14.000]  Certainly, not saying they're perfect, but the new world order is the big, aggressive, dominant thing that's on the Russian border.
[13:14.000 --> 13:18.000]  Here's some of what Tucker had to say Friday night.
[13:18.000 --> 13:27.000]  We'll play just one more portion of this exchange in which Matt Lee flips the usual script and accuses Ned Price of Senator Lincoln crazed conspiracy nut.
[13:27.000 --> 13:28.000]  It's beautiful.
[13:28.000 --> 13:29.000]  Watch.
[13:29.000 --> 13:37.000]  What is the evidence that they, I mean, this is like crisis actors, really, this is like Alex Jones territory you're getting into them.
[13:37.000 --> 13:44.000]  What evidence do you have to support the idea that there is some propaganda film in the making?
[13:44.000 --> 13:50.000]  Matt, this is derived from information known to the US government, intelligence information that we have declassified.
[13:50.000 --> 13:51.000]  I think you know.
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  Okay, well, where is it?
[13:53.000 --> 13:54.000]  Where is this information?
[13:54.000 --> 13:57.000]  It is intelligence information that we have declassified.
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.000]  Where is it? Where's the declassified information?
[13:59.000 --> 14:01.000]  I just delivered it.
[14:01.000 --> 14:05.000]  No, you made a series of allegations.
[14:05.000 --> 14:08.000]  One correction.
[14:08.000 --> 14:13.000]  Alex Jones lies far less and is far more credible than Ned Price is.
[14:13.000 --> 14:16.000]  But you see the point, Ned Price lost that exchange.
[14:16.000 --> 14:21.000]  He claimed to have information that he did not have and Matt Lee persistently called him out on it.
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  So Ned Price just ran out of BS.
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.000]  The BS barrel was empty.
[14:25.000 --> 14:27.000]  So what did he do then?
[14:27.000 --> 14:28.000]  What did Ned Price do then?
[14:28.000 --> 14:29.000]  You know the answer.
[14:29.000 --> 14:32.000]  Ned Price did what they all do when they're cornered.
[14:32.000 --> 14:35.000]  He went right to the lowest personal attack.
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.000]  He didn't call Matt Lee racist.
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.000]  He's probably saving that for next week.
[14:39.000 --> 14:45.000]  But he did suggest that Matt Lee is more sympathetic to Russia than he is to his own country, the United States.
[14:45.000 --> 14:48.000]  He implied that Matt Lee is a shill for Vladimir Putin.
[14:48.000 --> 14:49.000]  Watch.
[14:49.000 --> 14:55.000]  If you doubt the credibility of the US government, of the British government, of other governments,
[14:55.000 --> 15:03.000]  and want to find solace and information that the Russians are putting out, that is for you to do.
[15:03.000 --> 15:08.000]  I'm asking what the Russian government is putting out and what is it supposed to mean?
[15:08.000 --> 15:15.000]  So if you're on Russia's side, now in an earlier age, this is the point where Matt Lee would have vaulted the podium
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.000]  and punched Ned Price right in the face.
[15:17.000 --> 15:22.000]  There was a time in this country when calling a man disloyal was a grave and serious charge.
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  You could not let that stand.
[15:24.000 --> 15:25.000]  That's not true anymore.
[15:25.000 --> 15:26.000]  We're so used to it now.
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  We hear it constantly.
[15:28.000 --> 15:48.000]  And Tucker Carlson in the full report will air coming up later in this hour, or if not, if you don't have time, when I host the 3rd and 4th Power, you got to go watch it. It's on infowars.com.
[15:48.000 --> 16:00.000]  So that's the country we live in, ladies and gentlemen, where the deep state thinks it owns all of us, like we're in North Korea. Stay with us.
[16:00.000 --> 16:06.000]  I really regret it when I forget to take high quality iodine supplements.
[16:06.000 --> 16:08.000]  It is the good halogen.
[16:08.000 --> 16:17.000]  The UN admits 2 billion plus people have cognitive disabilities on the face of the earth today.
[16:17.000 --> 16:23.000]  That's over 20% because they have had iodine deficiencies.
[16:23.000 --> 16:25.000]  Now, we've got two different great iodine products.
[16:25.000 --> 16:27.000]  We've got X2. It's amazing.
[16:27.000 --> 16:30.000]  Pure deep earth crystal atomic iodine.
[16:30.000 --> 16:32.000]  And it's been sold out for a while.
[16:32.000 --> 16:42.000]  We finally got X3 back in that is the deep earth crystal iodine and then two other types because some studies show it helps with the absorption of the pure iodine.
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  So it's apples and oranges.
[16:44.000 --> 16:50.000]  Both formulas are excellent. People constantly ask me, including on the street, what's better, X2 or X3?
[16:50.000 --> 16:56.000]  Apples and oranges. It's like, do you like iceberg lettuce or do you like spinach?
[16:56.000 --> 17:02.000]  I mean, it's two different things or it's like a tomato versus a potato.
[17:02.000 --> 17:05.000]  Bottom line, your body needs iodine.
[17:05.000 --> 17:13.000]  And the globalists are bombarding all of us with bad halogens, fluoride, bromine, chloride.
[17:13.000 --> 17:19.000]  All of those systems that block fertility, block our electrochemical cells, block our immune system.
[17:19.000 --> 17:24.000]  So just on the immune system front, so many people have deficiencies in iodine.

[18:00.000 --> 18:04.000]  Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee. Welcome.
[18:04.000 --> 18:05.000]  Hello, Alex.
[18:05.000 --> 18:06.000]  Yes, Malcolm.
[18:06.000 --> 18:10.000]  All right, I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the line.
[18:10.000 --> 18:14.000]  I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer.
[18:14.000 --> 18:17.000]  Supermell Vitality and Brainforce Plus.
[18:17.000 --> 18:20.000]  Mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank.
[18:20.000 --> 18:22.000]  Supermell Vitality really, really works.
[18:22.000 --> 18:27.000]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[18:27.000 --> 18:34.000]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well but just aren't as strong.
[18:34.000 --> 18:36.000]  This is like a very fine wine.
[18:36.000 --> 18:38.000]  In fact, each batch is different.
[18:38.000 --> 18:40.000]  It's super strong. Sometimes it's just okay.
[18:40.000 --> 18:43.000]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[18:43.000 --> 18:45.000]  That's just how it is. It's how it works.
[18:45.000 --> 18:47.000]  So it's always good.
[18:47.000 --> 18:49.000]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[18:49.000 --> 19:12.000]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[19:20.000 --> 19:23.000]  They are now deep banking us behind the scenes.
[19:23.000 --> 19:27.000]  They want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly.
[19:27.000 --> 19:32.000]  With practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps,
[19:32.000 --> 19:35.000]  the traders know they can shut us down by force.
[19:35.000 --> 19:38.000]  But that would accelerate the awakening exponentially.
[19:38.000 --> 19:40.000]  So be it.
[19:40.000 --> 19:42.000]  Make them silence us by force.
[19:42.000 --> 19:45.000]  This is the final battle of the information war.
[19:45.000 --> 19:49.000]  Give now. Buy products. Donate.
[19:49.000 --> 19:54.000]  Before everything changes, we need you to carry us through to the end.
[19:54.000 --> 20:23.000]  Victory or death, go now to infowarstore.com.
[20:23.000 --> 20:26.000]  People are really waking up fast.
[20:26.000 --> 20:29.000]  The mass is coming off.
[20:29.000 --> 20:34.000]  Just a few days ago on Thursday, Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the house,
[20:34.000 --> 20:41.000]  got up on TV and said, do not protest, do not speak out, do not criticize anything when you're in China,
[20:41.000 --> 20:44.000]  or you'll get disappeared like this Dutch reporter.
[20:44.000 --> 20:46.000]  TV viewers can see this.
[20:46.000 --> 20:49.000]  The video is posted up on infowars.com.
[20:49.000 --> 20:57.000]  The reporter hauled off by CCP officials during Olympic's live report,
[20:57.000 --> 21:00.000]  because they didn't like what he had to say.
[21:00.000 --> 21:09.000]  You see the red armband of the thought police that he was taken away to a police facility
[21:09.000 --> 21:16.000]  reportedly will be deported if he's locking as they disappear him.
[21:16.000 --> 21:23.000]  There you go. And so Pelosi told folks, he said, I would say to our athletes,
[21:23.000 --> 21:28.000]  you're there to compete, do not risk incurring the anger of the Chinese government,
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.000]  because they are ruthless, Pelosi said.
[21:30.000 --> 21:35.000]  I know there is a temptation on the part of some to speak out while they're there.
[21:35.000 --> 21:37.000]  I respect that.
[21:37.000 --> 21:41.000]  Then she goes, but, and then she goes on to say, they don't care what you say.
[21:41.000 --> 21:44.000]  Here's the issue.
[21:44.000 --> 21:49.000]  Communist China is a competing tyranny to the globalist of hijacked America.
[21:49.000 --> 21:54.000]  And they're a competing power structure to the European Union and the Russians.
[21:54.000 --> 21:57.000]  Those are the major power structures that are governmental.
[21:57.000 --> 22:01.000]  There's the United States and the Anglo-American corporate combine.
[22:01.000 --> 22:03.000]  That's what they call themselves.
[22:03.000 --> 22:07.000]  There is the EU that's partially outlive with that.
[22:07.000 --> 22:10.000]  There is the Communist Chinese and there is the Russians.
[22:10.000 --> 22:14.000]  Now, above that is the Davos group and the UN and the multinational corporations
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.000]  that formed the New World Order.
[22:16.000 --> 22:21.000]  And they are in full control of the Anglo-American establishment, a military arm.
[22:21.000 --> 22:26.000]  That is the UK and the US and the Commonwealth nations.
[22:26.000 --> 22:30.000]  And so that's why you see the US as a quasi-Commonwealth nation now.
[22:30.000 --> 22:34.000]  On every channel, they celebrated the Queen's 70th year of reign today
[22:34.000 --> 22:39.000]  and how magnificent it is and how wondrous.
[22:39.000 --> 22:42.000]  That didn't start until the 20s when British intelligence began infiltrating
[22:42.000 --> 22:44.000]  and taking over the US government.
[22:44.000 --> 22:46.000]  By the way, they've all written books on it.
[22:46.000 --> 22:50.000]  It's not denied at PhD level classes at Georgetown.
[22:50.000 --> 22:53.000]  They teach you at Harvard and Georgetown and the Foreign Service
[22:53.000 --> 22:57.000]  that you are in the Queen's service and a global government that they know best
[22:57.000 --> 23:01.000]  and you're a Kingsman and all of this and has nothing to do with the Brits.
[23:01.000 --> 23:06.000]  It's that combine of the British East India Company and the rest of it.
[23:06.000 --> 23:11.000]  So that's the global government system of corporate rule
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  is the British and Dutch East India Companies.
[23:13.000 --> 23:17.000]  That's what this all comes out of.
[23:17.000 --> 23:20.000]  And so that's why you're told George Washington is bad
[23:20.000 --> 23:24.000]  and Thomas Jefferson is evil and Teddy Roosevelt is bad
[23:24.000 --> 23:29.000]  but God save the Queen.
[23:29.000 --> 23:33.000]  And Pelosi says you need to shut your mouth.
[23:33.000 --> 23:36.000]  If you're an American over there, meanwhile, there's censoring people here.
[23:36.000 --> 23:42.000]  We have the spectacle of the press secretary saying she basically wants Joe Rogan shut down
[23:42.000 --> 23:45.000]  and they have legislation now they're trying to pass.
[23:45.000 --> 23:51.000]  That's heavily sponsored may pass in the house to start funding mainstream corporate media
[23:51.000 --> 23:54.000]  and certify that only it is allowed to be on social media
[23:54.000 --> 24:00.000]  where everyone else who isn't certified can't even have a chance to have someone share your article.
[24:00.000 --> 24:08.000]  And if you violate the certification by creating a future news dot news or a reset wars dot com.
[24:08.000 --> 24:11.000]  Well, that's criminal.
[24:11.000 --> 24:17.000]  Including first, I mean, folks, this is North Korea level stuff.
[24:17.000 --> 24:21.000]  So while they criticize China, which they should, they don't say a word about us,
[24:21.000 --> 24:24.000]  but you see China was set up by the globalist.
[24:24.000 --> 24:27.000]  China was set up by the New World Order.
[24:27.000 --> 24:30.000]  China was set up by this entire system.
[24:30.000 --> 24:33.000]  And now what did Xi Jinping start doing in the last five years?
[24:33.000 --> 24:39.000]  He said, no, I'm going to have a big military to not just control the world's raw materials and resources.
[24:39.000 --> 24:40.000]  That's the deal they made.
[24:40.000 --> 24:43.000]  China will do all the manufacturing control the world that way.
[24:43.000 --> 24:45.000]  But the West will have the military.
[24:45.000 --> 24:50.000]  China, of course, double cross didn't follow that and is now trying to take over the United States with their spies and operatives.
[24:50.000 --> 24:54.000]  And now the FBI that said there weren't any Chinese spies is like panicking saying,
[24:54.000 --> 24:58.000]  oh, my God, they're everywhere. They're taking over. Good Lord, help us.
[24:58.000 --> 25:02.000]  Because they were so busy trying to crush America and take our guns and dumb us down
[25:02.000 --> 25:06.000]  and cut our son's penises off literally as their sacrament of Satanism
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.000]  that now the chai comms have double crossed them and own Hollywood and everything else
[25:10.000 --> 25:14.000]  and are rolling up the Democrats' spies.
[25:14.000 --> 25:18.000]  So suddenly all these chai comm agents are suddenly saying China is a threat,
[25:18.000 --> 25:22.000]  but only because they're in trouble.
[25:22.000 --> 25:26.000]  So that's where all this is going.
[25:26.000 --> 25:33.000]  And just like Hitler made deals with Stalin and Hitler then double crossed Stalin,
[25:33.000 --> 25:37.000]  it's the same thing going on here.
[25:37.000 --> 25:39.000]  One criminal group's made a deal with another criminal group,
[25:39.000 --> 25:43.000]  and now that it's time to cut up the loot, they're trying to kill each other.
[25:43.000 --> 25:48.000]  There's no honor among thieves, as it has been said for thousands of years,
[25:48.000 --> 25:53.000]  because it's a law of the universe, a law of the world, and it's what's going on.
[25:53.000 --> 25:59.000]  So all of the China file, China worship by the Democratic Party and by the Washington Post
[25:59.000 --> 26:03.000]  and by all the rest of them, how Xi Jinping's going to save us
[26:03.000 --> 26:06.000]  and Xi Jinping's going to crush Trump.
[26:06.000 --> 26:09.000]  Remember that big headline in the Washington Post?
[26:09.000 --> 26:13.000]  Suddenly, like you flip a switch, just like he was Uncle Joe Stalin.
[26:13.000 --> 26:16.000]  He was the best guy for America. He was a reformer.
[26:16.000 --> 26:20.000]  He was a humanitarian. New York Times, Washington Post, Time Magazine.
[26:20.000 --> 26:23.000]  Joe Stalin is the man. If he can't do it, nobody can.
[26:23.000 --> 26:30.000]  And as soon as World War II ended and as soon as Churchill gave his Iron Curtain speech
[26:30.000 --> 26:37.000]  and as soon as that began, suddenly he was the biggest devil the world had ever seen.
[26:37.000 --> 26:40.000]  And by the way, he was pretty bad by every yardstick.
[26:40.000 --> 26:45.000]  But the point is, is that you have these power structures fighting with each other
[26:45.000 --> 26:50.000]  and these big multinational corporations that want to dissolve the nation states
[26:50.000 --> 26:56.000]  and want to only have a world UN army trying to balance all of that and get full control
[26:56.000 --> 27:00.000]  and engineering the virus release and the lockdowns and the tyranny
[27:00.000 --> 27:04.000]  as a tip to give their corporations and systems more control.
[27:04.000 --> 27:11.000]  But now it's already starting to unravel incredibly quickly.
[27:11.000 --> 27:16.000]  So when we come back, we're going to lay out more of what's really going on geopolitically
[27:16.000 --> 27:25.000]  and why Biden is trying to start a war or a proxy war that's already going on with Russia
[27:25.000 --> 27:28.000]  and what we can expect with 275 days from the election.
[27:28.000 --> 27:33.000]  But what have I been saying year after year, month after month, day after day?
[27:33.000 --> 27:37.000]  Cyber attacks the globalist launch, they'll blame on foreign powers
[27:37.000 --> 27:41.000]  because they stand to gain from staying in power as posing as our protectors
[27:41.000 --> 27:44.000]  when they have all the motives and history of actually running the attacks.
[27:44.000 --> 27:50.000]  Economic implosions, wars, imploding borders, inflation.
[27:50.000 --> 27:54.000]  The globalists are waging war against the populations they want to suck dry and make poor
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.000]  so they can control us and depopulate us under a medical tyranny takeover.
[27:58.000 --> 28:02.000]  Just like Hitler was busy trying to kill all these indigenous populations he didn't like
[28:02.000 --> 28:07.000]  while he was fighting the Russians and the Allies and all the rest of it.
[28:07.000 --> 28:11.000]  And it's the same globalist strain that created Hitler,
[28:11.000 --> 28:14.000]  has now created Klaus Schwab and the Bilderberg group and the New World Order.
[28:14.000 --> 28:19.000]  So they want a medical tyranny, they want to slowly suck a stride, make Reptiston kill us
[28:19.000 --> 28:23.000]  because their main religion is killing people through medical tyranny.
[28:23.000 --> 28:28.000]  It's the sick thing they're into, it's how they get their kicks, it's their fetish.
[28:28.000 --> 28:33.000]  While they try to dominate the big commie power structure, they put it in China to feed off them
[28:33.000 --> 28:37.000]  and the same Anglo-American establishment put the Bolsheviks in under Lenin
[28:37.000 --> 28:41.000]  but Stalin double-crossed Lenin and kicked him out along with Trotsky,
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  who killed Lenin, kicked out Trotsky.
[28:43.000 --> 28:46.000]  And so the globalists are like, we control you, we control you, we control you,
[28:46.000 --> 28:48.000]  we hate our own people too.
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  They're trying to kill the Russians, kill the Chinese, kill the Americans,
[28:50.000 --> 28:54.000]  kill the patriots, kill the babies, kill the children, cut the boys' penises off in America.
[28:54.000 --> 28:58.000]  That's their whole mission is kill, kill, kill, murder everybody.
[29:24.000 --> 29:27.000]  I want to keep you in a psychological, spiritual prison.
[29:27.000 --> 29:30.000]  This gives you the tools to break out of that system.
[29:30.000 --> 29:34.000]  This points out the tools that God created and has already given you
[29:34.000 --> 29:37.000]  but that most people forgot or never discovered.
[29:37.000 --> 29:42.000]  ResetWars.com right now has this course seven hours long,
[29:42.000 --> 29:48.000]  four, fifty percent off, and your purchase funds the M4 war, so it's a 360 win.
[29:48.000 --> 29:50.000]  The only way you fail is not taking action.
[29:50.000 --> 29:53.000]  This is the most important information I've ever put out
[29:53.000 --> 29:58.000]  available exclusively at resetwars.com for fifty percent off for seventy-two hours.
[29:58.000 --> 30:27.000]  ResetWars.com
[30:28.000 --> 30:54.000]  ResetWars.com
[30:54.000 --> 30:59.000]  ResetWars.com
[31:24.000 --> 31:27.000]  It took him millions of dollars to defend himself.
[31:27.000 --> 31:32.000]  How can the average person rest assured that while they're protecting their family,
[31:32.000 --> 31:35.000]  their business, and their own lives that they're safe?
[31:35.000 --> 31:40.000]  You do that with high quality insurance that protects you when you use the firearm
[31:40.000 --> 31:43.000]  to defend yourself, your property, or your family.
[31:43.000 --> 31:46.000]  This is something that is so incredibly important.
[31:46.000 --> 31:50.000]  Now there's a lot of companies out there offering insurance, a lot of great companies,
[31:50.000 --> 31:55.000]  but the Palmetto State Armory is moving very, very strongly into this market
[31:55.000 --> 31:58.000]  with the best package out there that we found.
[31:58.000 --> 32:02.000]  This is real certified insurance at an incredibly low price.
[32:02.000 --> 32:06.000]  The plans start at just ten ninety-five a month,
[32:06.000 --> 32:11.000]  up to two million dollars of coverage with multiple levels of protection to choose from.
[32:11.000 --> 32:15.000]  Depending on which tier you sign up for, you get between twenty and a hundred dollars
[32:15.000 --> 32:18.000]  on your gift card for simply signing up for the first month,
[32:18.000 --> 32:22.000]  and you are promoting an organization that is pro-gun, pro-second amendment,
[32:22.000 --> 32:24.000]  pro-free speech, and pro-American.
[32:24.000 --> 32:27.000]  Here's an example of insurance in your life.
[32:27.000 --> 32:29.000]  We've been covering anticoviolence for many years,
[32:29.000 --> 32:33.000]  and they've gotten so vicious we had to buy an armored vehicle three years ago
[32:33.000 --> 32:36.000]  to just go out and cover the events.
[32:36.000 --> 32:41.000]  This is a form of insurance, and it costs a lot more than the very low prices
[32:41.000 --> 32:43.000]  at ProtectWithAlex.com.
[32:43.000 --> 32:48.000]  You need the insurance of ProtectWithAlex.com to sleep securely at night knowing
[32:48.000 --> 32:52.000]  you're prepared and have up to two million dollars of coverage
[32:52.000 --> 32:54.000]  ready to protect your life and your liberty.
[32:54.000 --> 32:57.000]  Go to ProtectWithAlex.com today and become a member,
[32:57.000 --> 33:26.000]  and I want to thank you for your support.
[33:27.000 --> 33:43.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live on this February 6 Sunday.
[33:43.000 --> 33:45.000]  Worldwide transmission.
[33:45.000 --> 33:48.000]  Remember, the signal gets boosted and we reach more people
[33:48.000 --> 33:53.000]  and are able to take on the globalist when you take the live feeds from
[33:53.000 --> 33:58.000]  futurenews.news from infowars.com forward slash show
[33:58.000 --> 34:02.000]  or from local radio stations that you're listening to on the AM or FM dial
[34:02.000 --> 34:08.000]  and share their station feed that has my show transmitted on as well,
[34:08.000 --> 34:12.000]  and that's how we reach new people in this information war.
[34:12.000 --> 34:17.000]  Again, the entire New World Order program is about suppression of information
[34:17.000 --> 34:21.000]  when they make their big biomedical tyranny takeover move
[34:21.000 --> 34:25.000]  that is in operation dark winter, that is in operation lockstep,
[34:25.000 --> 34:30.000]  that is in operation event 201 and many others down to the finest details
[34:30.000 --> 34:34.000]  of how they would create the virus, release the virus,
[34:34.000 --> 34:38.000]  and then train us to live in fear and then forcibly inject us with a gene therapy
[34:38.000 --> 34:42.000]  that erases our immune system and then give us a world ID
[34:42.000 --> 34:47.000]  through the vaccine passport via the phones to track and trace everywhere we go
[34:47.000 --> 34:50.000]  and control what we do.
[34:50.000 --> 34:54.000]  And coming up today, I'm going to host right through to 8 o'clock tonight
[34:54.000 --> 35:01.000]  and I'm going to air some incredible excerpts from a very important event
[35:01.000 --> 35:06.000]  taking place in Germany right now where they are having an international
[35:06.000 --> 35:11.000]  criminal court hearing with top judges, lawyers, scientists, and others
[35:11.000 --> 35:17.000]  and they have handed down the findings of recommended indictments.
[35:17.000 --> 35:22.000]  Now, one of the things that the Pentagon, going back to the 1940s
[35:22.000 --> 35:27.000]  when it said it was in the business of freedom, said it's important to do
[35:27.000 --> 35:35.000]  is to first have people's courts but with prestigious people.
[35:35.000 --> 35:41.000]  That's what the Declaration of Independence was, the Continental Congress.
[35:41.000 --> 35:45.000]  And then you put the evidence on so the public sees it
[35:45.000 --> 35:48.000]  and that day the newspapers should come and write about it.
[35:48.000 --> 35:51.000]  The public would then debate about it, decide what they wanted to do.
[35:51.000 --> 35:57.000]  Committees of correspondence grew in to the Continental Congress
[35:57.000 --> 36:00.000]  in July 4th and the rest is history.
[36:00.000 --> 36:07.000]  And if you go into the Pentagon's 198 ways for civil disobedience
[36:07.000 --> 36:13.000]  and nonviolent resistance, one of the main one is mock trials and mock juries.
[36:13.000 --> 36:17.000]  Now, this is a very prestigious one that just took place in Germany
[36:17.000 --> 36:19.000]  and there's hours and hours of it.
[36:19.000 --> 36:26.000]  I've got a few excerpts, 30 minutes or so, that will air in the 4th hour tonight.
[36:26.000 --> 36:30.000]  We also have a big article on infowars.com with some of the key quotes
[36:30.000 --> 36:36.000]  and links and videos there that I suggest you go and you get.
[36:36.000 --> 36:41.000]  Now, it's not just mock grand jury investigations going on
[36:41.000 --> 36:45.000]  or international criminal courts going on in Nuremberg, too.
[36:45.000 --> 36:47.000]  Here's some of the big articles.
[36:47.000 --> 36:49.000]  Business Insider and others.
[36:49.000 --> 36:53.000]  Rand Paul, Senator, says Republicans will investigate Fauci if they retake the Senate,
[36:53.000 --> 36:56.000]  escalating a long-running personal feud, says Business Insider.
[36:56.000 --> 36:58.000]  No, he lied about gain of function.
[36:58.000 --> 36:59.000]  He ran the program.
[36:59.000 --> 37:00.000]  He said weaponize it.
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  He created COVID-19 on record.
[37:02.000 --> 37:05.000]  He deserves to go to prison for the rest of his life, bare minimum.
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  Paul promises investigation of Fauci.
[37:07.000 --> 37:13.000]  Republicans take Senate. You're like, well, promises, promises. Oh, but guess what?
[37:13.000 --> 37:22.000]  Congress has now started an investigation into Fauci and gain of function.
[37:22.000 --> 37:24.000]  So that's very, very important.
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.000]  And this happens because you can see all these articles.
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.000]  I go through them. I mix them up.
[37:28.000 --> 37:32.000]  Guys, I had the article in my stack where Congress announces in the committee,
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.000]  announces, even though Democrats are in control,
[37:34.000 --> 37:38.000]  an investigation of the Wuhan virus, origin and Fauci gain of function.
[37:38.000 --> 37:40.000]  That was the biggest story today.
[37:40.000 --> 37:46.000]  And for some reason, I just got it mixed into my stack and cannot find it.
[37:46.000 --> 37:49.000]  But it was here.
[37:49.000 --> 37:54.000]  And so I'm asking you guys to find that for me ASAP.
[37:54.000 --> 37:56.000]  Working on it, thank you very much.
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.000]  But that's a big deal right there.
[37:58.000 --> 38:01.000]  So you've got Paul doing this.
[38:01.000 --> 38:05.000]  And then we've also got a new criminal investigation started by Parliament in the UK.
[38:05.000 --> 38:09.000]  And so some good things are happening, some amazing things are happening,
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  and we're closing in on these criminals.
[38:11.000 --> 38:15.000]  So Rand Paul comes out and says they're going to launch a criminal investigation.
[38:15.000 --> 38:20.000]  British scientist Sir Jeremy Farr faces U.S. Congress probe.
[38:20.000 --> 38:23.000]  Oh, here's another one, too, over COVID cover up concerns.
[38:23.000 --> 38:28.000]  Daily Mail, one of Britain's top scientists is to be interviewed under oath by the U.S. Congress
[38:28.000 --> 38:32.000]  about the concerns that he was at the center of a cover up about the origins of COVID-19.
[38:32.000 --> 38:39.000]  Because he's in the emails with Fauci and Dasik saying they're going to cover it up through the medical journals.
[38:39.000 --> 38:45.000]  Sir Jeremy Farr was among a group of scientists who initially claimed the coronavirus could have been
[38:45.000 --> 38:49.000]  manmade in a lab in the Chinese city of Wuhan where the pandemic began.
[38:49.000 --> 38:52.000]  But after discussion with the U.S. officials and other leading scientists,
[38:52.000 --> 38:54.000]  in February of 2020, he changed his position.
[38:54.000 --> 38:58.000]  So they're going after the lowest level and moving up towards the top of the pyramid of criminals.
[38:58.000 --> 39:01.000]  That would be Bill Gates in the New World Order.
[39:01.000 --> 39:05.000]  So there is one of those congressional investigations going on right there.
[39:05.000 --> 39:07.000]  And then here's what I was mentioning.
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  I want to play a clip of this, clip one.
[39:09.000 --> 39:15.000]  International criminal grand jury investigation.
[39:15.000 --> 39:19.000]  Psychopathic global issues, COVID to commit crimes against humanity.
[39:19.000 --> 39:25.000]  And these are current judges, former judges, top lawyers, top scientists, a who's who
[39:25.000 --> 39:29.000]  at this international coalition of lawyers and judges convened a hearing
[39:29.000 --> 39:36.000]  to prosecute the crimes against humanity perpetrated by governments who used COVID-19 as the pretext.
[39:36.000 --> 39:41.000]  Great reset, New World Order, all the documents, how they did it, it is incredible.
[39:41.000 --> 39:46.000]  And they say this is a blueprint for grand juries to indict in Europe and the U.K. and the U.S.
[39:46.000 --> 39:49.000]  and Canada and their areas and a blueprint for governments
[39:49.000 --> 39:53.000]  and other magistrates to begin criminal prosecutions.
[39:53.000 --> 40:00.000]  Here is a short clip of U.S. German attorney, Dr. Reiner Fulmick,
[40:00.000 --> 40:04.000]  gives statements at the International Criminal Grand Jury.
[40:04.000 --> 40:08.000]  Here's clip one, our governments are not our governments anymore.
[40:08.000 --> 40:11.000]  Rather, they have been taken over by the World Economic Forum.
[40:11.000 --> 40:18.000]  Three, the same people who made the swine flu, which ultimately turned out to be a mild flu
[40:18.000 --> 40:24.000]  into a pandemic 12 years ago by first changing the definition of what a pandemic is
[40:24.000 --> 40:29.000]  and then creating panic created this corona pandemic.
[40:29.000 --> 40:34.000]  The swine flu was their first real attempt at creating a pandemic.
[40:34.000 --> 40:40.000]  And just as one of its purposes then was to divert our attention from the blatantly fraudulent activities
[40:40.000 --> 40:45.000]  of their financial industry, more aptly to be called a financial mafia,
[40:45.000 --> 40:48.000]  which had become visible through the Lehman crisis,
[40:48.000 --> 40:53.000]  this is also one of their major purposes of this corona pandemic now.
[40:53.000 --> 40:58.000]  Had we taken a closer look then during the Lehman crisis,
[40:58.000 --> 41:01.000]  instead of blindly believing our governments,
[41:01.000 --> 41:07.000]  government's promises that the perpetrators of those financial crimes will be held liable,
[41:07.000 --> 41:13.000]  we would have seen then that they had been looting and plundering our public coffers for decades.
[41:13.000 --> 41:17.000]  And we would have seen that our governments are not our governments anymore.
[41:17.000 --> 41:22.000]  Rather, they have been taken over by the other side through their main platform,
[41:22.000 --> 41:27.000]  the World Economic Forum, which had started to create their own global leaders
[41:27.000 --> 41:31.000]  through their young global leaders program as early as 1992.
[41:31.000 --> 41:35.000]  Two of the first graduates being Angela Merkel and Bill Gates.
[41:35.000 --> 41:41.000]  And we would have understood already then what we will show you now through this proceeding.
[41:41.000 --> 41:45.000]  These financial crimes went unchallenged by our politicians
[41:45.000 --> 41:52.000]  because they're aiding and abetting those who commit them and profiting from these crimes.
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is so powerful.
[41:54.000 --> 41:56.000]  We're going to have big excerpts of this for you in the fourth hour,
[41:56.000 --> 42:01.000]  but links to the whole thing are at infowars.com right now.
[42:01.000 --> 42:05.000]  International criminal grand jury investigation, psychopathic global issues,
[42:05.000 --> 42:07.000]  COVID to commit crimes against humanity.
[42:07.000 --> 42:10.000]  This will bring them down. This has all the proof.
[42:10.000 --> 42:13.000]  You've got to share it like your life depends on it because it does.
[42:13.000 --> 42:16.000]  The children are counting on us, ladies and gentlemen.
[42:16.000 --> 42:20.000]  In places like Austria, the deadly COVID jab is now mandatory,
[42:20.000 --> 42:24.000]  six months in prison, and forced injections.
[42:24.000 --> 42:30.000]  The end of the Nuremberg Code, the greatest tyranny ever seen at this scale.
[42:30.000 --> 42:33.000]  Former BlackRock executive's gone public as a whistleblower says
[42:33.000 --> 42:36.000]  Big Pharma's liability shields could be at risk if fraud is discovered.
[42:36.000 --> 42:41.000]  He now says it is, and depopulation, and it gets worse.
[42:41.000 --> 42:44.000]  Now the Pentagon has confirmed major whistleblowers that went public,
[42:44.000 --> 42:49.000]  confirming massive death and illnesses inside of the military with the deadly shot.
[42:49.000 --> 42:53.000]  This is genocide. This is a globalist attack on our military.
[42:53.000 --> 42:54.000]  We'll drive back.
[42:54.000 --> 42:59.000]  The Nuremberg Code
[42:59.000 --> 43:03.000]  Sold out for months, X3 is now back in stock.
[43:03.000 --> 43:06.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game-changing,
[43:06.000 --> 43:11.000]  our products are game-changing, and so many people are deficient in iodine.
[43:11.000 --> 43:15.000]  It's not the soil anymore. Most of the ocean is contaminated,
[43:15.000 --> 43:20.000]  but when you get high-quality iodine, all three of the healthy types together,
[43:20.000 --> 43:24.000]  it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido,
[43:24.000 --> 43:26.000]  but most importantly, your immune system.
[43:26.000 --> 43:31.000]  So, X3, the only tri-iodine on the market, highest grade,
[43:31.000 --> 43:36.000]  is now exclusively available again at 50% off at mforeshore.com.

[43:39.000 --> 43:41.000]  and what it does for your body, it takes about two weeks to get on average,
[43:41.000 --> 43:44.000]  you really need to experience X3.
[43:44.000 --> 43:47.000]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it,
[43:47.000 --> 43:50.000]  but particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it
[43:50.000 --> 43:53.000]  because it's amazing what does for your body, it's the good halogen,
[43:53.000 --> 43:57.000]  it's not the bad halogen, and it funds the M4 war, a true 360 win.
[43:57.000 --> 44:18.000]  X3, back at stock, 50% off at limited time.
[44:27.000 --> 44:31.000]  Garamaseep, which is loaded with energy compounds and antioxidants
[44:31.000 --> 44:34.000]  that have been used by Amazonian tribes for centuries.
[44:34.000 --> 44:37.000]  AlphaGPC, a natural compound found in the brain
[44:37.000 --> 44:41.000]  that delivers an essential nutrient, Koli, and Ginkoli,
[44:41.000 --> 44:44.000]  which is also known for its exceptional antioxidant content.
[44:44.000 --> 44:48.000]  This product is more than twice the servings of our Brain Force Plus as well,
[44:48.000 --> 44:50.000]  so you know it's packed full of the good stuff.
[44:50.000 --> 44:55.000]  Destroy that brain fog today and secure your bottle of Brain Force Ultra
[44:55.000 --> 45:00.000]  before it is completely sold out at M4store.com.
[45:25.000 --> 45:28.000]  We've formulated to improve upon our best-selling product, Knockout,
[45:28.000 --> 45:32.000]  with down and out, now the herbs and melatonin packed inside
[45:32.000 --> 45:35.000]  are extracted directly into the glycerin solution,
[45:35.000 --> 45:40.000]  so the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[45:40.000 --> 45:44.000]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the Passion Flower,
[45:44.000 --> 45:48.000]  which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees,
[45:48.000 --> 45:51.000]  who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[45:51.000 --> 45:54.000]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep

[45:56.000 --> 46:25.000]  Selling it out now at M4store.com.
[46:26.000 --> 46:29.000]  And you know, I'm telling you, the Vitamin D gummies,

[46:31.000 --> 46:32.000]  They're going to love it.
[46:32.000 --> 46:34.000]  They're going to love the taste of the gummies.
[46:34.000 --> 46:35.000]  It's healthy.
[46:35.000 --> 46:37.000]  So that's just a great thing for kids.
[46:37.000 --> 46:38.000]  I mean, we could just do marketing campaigns.
[46:38.000 --> 46:40.000]  I think for kids, that'd be great.
[46:40.000 --> 46:43.000]  The calcium good for them, the Vitamin D.
[46:43.000 --> 46:46.000]  So that's at infowarstore.com.
[46:46.000 --> 46:49.000]  And again, it's your support there that keeps us on the air.
[46:49.000 --> 46:53.000]  So the supplements, the shirts, the air filters, the water filters,
[46:53.000 --> 46:57.000]  the emergency food supplies, the emergency supplies at infowarstore.com.
[46:57.000 --> 46:59.000]  Your support there keeps us on the air.
[46:59.000 --> 47:28.000]  Thank you.
[47:29.000 --> 47:43.000]  This is a special edition of the Sunday edition of the Alice Jones Show.
[47:43.000 --> 47:48.000]  Carmely I come in here from 4 to 6 p.m. and love every minute of it.
[47:48.000 --> 47:50.000]  The great honor of being able to talk to so many of you.
[47:50.000 --> 47:56.000]  But tonight, I'm going to host Sunday Live that Owen Schreuer and Harrison Smith
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.000]  and Christy Lee rotate through.
[47:58.000 --> 48:04.000]  This is important every Sunday to have live information as the week begins.
[48:04.000 --> 48:06.000]  But tonight, I'm going to be hosting.
[48:06.000 --> 48:10.000]  And the first 45 minutes or so, we're going to get into Joe Rogan.
[48:10.000 --> 48:12.000]  And now they're trying to take him off the air and how they're going through
[48:12.000 --> 48:17.000]  his whole catalog of things he's said and done and are really fighting to remove him
[48:17.000 --> 48:21.000]  because they have to remove the idea of you being able to listen to what you want
[48:21.000 --> 48:25.000]  and for you being able to question their narrative and their fraud.
[48:25.000 --> 48:31.000]  And, you know, I know basically quite a bit of the inside baseball, the whole thing.
[48:31.000 --> 48:35.000]  I'm not at liberty to get into all of it or why more of the episodes have been taken down
[48:35.000 --> 48:37.000]  by Spotify and the rest of it.
[48:37.000 --> 48:41.000]  But this will be critical information for all of our free speech and our first
[48:41.000 --> 48:46.000]  amendment here in the United States, what I cover at the start of Sunday Live,
[48:46.000 --> 48:51.000]  6 p.m. tonight that will just roll over from the Alice Jones Show.
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  A lot of stations are picking up Sunday Live.
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  We only carry six minutes of ads an hour.
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  Those are the local spots.
[48:57.000 --> 48:58.000]  No network breaks.
[48:58.000 --> 49:02.000]  And that's as we phase in over the next few years into the podcast format.
[49:02.000 --> 49:07.000]  We'll still have a set up though for all of our great affiliates out there.
[49:07.000 --> 49:12.000]  And as I said, March 1st, I'm going to start two nights a week and then on Saturdays
[49:12.000 --> 49:19.000]  doing at least a two hour live commercial free show every single day for calls
[49:19.000 --> 49:23.000]  and guests and more because these are such intense incredible times.
[49:23.000 --> 49:27.000]  And the globalists have been trying to take us off the air and are desperately fighting
[49:27.000 --> 49:31.000]  to try to get me arrested or indicted and arrested and just trying to...
[49:31.000 --> 49:36.000]  It's their admitted goal because our work is so important to do that.
[49:36.000 --> 49:39.000]  And so, yes, the candle burns only half as long.
[49:39.000 --> 49:41.000]  It burns twice as bright.
[49:41.000 --> 49:44.000]  We're burning the candle at more than both ends.
[49:44.000 --> 49:48.000]  They were throwing a candle into a fire and it just explodes like gasoline.
[49:48.000 --> 49:49.000]  That's info wars.
[49:49.000 --> 49:54.000]  We're pedal to the metal, Mad Max all the way, not playing games, totally committed.
[49:54.000 --> 49:57.000]  So you know how real this is and how over the target we are.
[49:57.000 --> 50:01.000]  Now, Roger Stone's joining us in the next hour.
[50:01.000 --> 50:02.000]  And I should have hyped this better.
[50:02.000 --> 50:07.000]  I just get so much in my mind going on because he's been on fire lately.
[50:07.000 --> 50:13.000]  He's always informative and he has been heavily involved with the massive canvassing
[50:13.000 --> 50:17.000]  in Florida and other states that I saw being covered on OAN Friday.
[50:17.000 --> 50:23.000]  He's been involved in it and they have found 30, 40% of the voters are fake.
[50:23.000 --> 50:27.000]  And they found that, of course, it's for the Democrats side.
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  Almost none of it is skewed towards Republicans.
[50:29.000 --> 50:35.000]  There is some of that, but 90 plus percent is skewed towards Democrats.
[50:35.000 --> 50:39.000]  So they show up at people's houses that voted in the last election and they go,
[50:39.000 --> 50:43.000]  no, we've lived here five years and that person never lived here.
[50:43.000 --> 50:45.000]  I bought this house from A or Z.
[50:45.000 --> 50:49.000]  In some of the cases, they go, yeah, that guy moved out six months ago.
[50:49.000 --> 50:53.000]  But in large portions of the cases, it's totally fake.
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  But the people are voting.
[50:55.000 --> 50:58.000]  They have a name, they live there, but they don't really live there.
[50:58.000 --> 51:01.000]  And they live in California, but they're voting in Florida.
[51:01.000 --> 51:04.000]  Or they're voting in Texas, but they live in New York.
[51:04.000 --> 51:07.000]  I mean, and a lot of these are Democrats that know what's going on
[51:07.000 --> 51:12.000]  and they move all around the country and vote three or four times every election.
[51:12.000 --> 51:16.000]  So that's huge news, but we're not supposed to question it, right?
[51:16.000 --> 51:20.000]  Like, don't be racist towards Chinese people seeing and told us for years in ABC.
[51:20.000 --> 51:22.000]  There's no Chinese spies.
[51:22.000 --> 51:25.000]  And now the FBI director is like, they're taking over.
[51:25.000 --> 51:27.000]  It's an emergency. I'm blown away.
[51:27.000 --> 51:30.000]  This is the biggest threat ever. I can't believe it.
[51:30.000 --> 51:35.000]  All because the Chinese a bit slapped them and said, no, you work for us now,
[51:35.000 --> 51:36.000]  not the other way around.
[51:36.000 --> 51:42.000]  And we're going to have three kids as China openly owns four of the six production houses
[51:42.000 --> 51:47.000]  that literally teach that young boys should all be castrated and be little girls
[51:47.000 --> 51:49.000]  while it's illegal in China.
[51:49.000 --> 51:54.000]  But China pays and broadcast, cut your boys' penises off, cut your boys' penises off,
[51:54.000 --> 51:56.000]  cut your, I mean, that's what they do.
[51:56.000 --> 51:59.000]  And we're like, yes, sir, we're liberal. Get in there.
[51:59.000 --> 52:02.000]  And if they convince a five-year-old that they're really a girl,
[52:02.000 --> 52:05.000]  then at age seven, it's time for the surgery.
[52:05.000 --> 52:09.000]  And I don't hate people that grow up who are adults who feel like that's who they are.
[52:09.000 --> 52:10.000]  And they do that.
[52:10.000 --> 52:13.000]  The point is, is that the chemicals are in the water. Everything's in the food.
[52:13.000 --> 52:17.000]  Genital sizes are shrinking down. Men are becoming more effeminate.
[52:17.000 --> 52:21.000]  Because in utero, in the first trimester, there's a whole spectrum of chemicals
[52:21.000 --> 52:25.000]  that cause the male fetus to not fully develop into a male.
[52:25.000 --> 52:30.000]  And the basic stamp of a fetus in the zygote stage is female.
[52:30.000 --> 52:35.000]  And that's people ask, why do men have nipples? I mean, because the stamp
[52:35.000 --> 52:40.000]  and the original code of the embryo, and of course it gets into the sperm
[52:40.000 --> 52:44.000]  and deciding the sex, I mean, from the time the zygote's formed, it's a male or female.
[52:44.000 --> 52:51.000]  But the main imprint of the skeleton structure and the entire structure of the body
[52:51.000 --> 52:55.000]  is female and then the male traits develop.
[52:55.000 --> 52:57.000]  That is cut off by the chemicals.
[52:57.000 --> 53:00.000]  So this is a giant, admitted, globalist plan.
[53:00.000 --> 53:03.000]  And by the way, I forgot to air it on Friday.
[53:03.000 --> 53:10.000]  The head of Turning Point USA, Charlie Kirk, just gets more and more hardcore.
[53:10.000 --> 53:16.000]  I didn't like him. I mean, I met him at RNC 2016. He seemed like a likeable fellow.
[53:16.000 --> 53:21.000]  And I thought they did some good, but you know, kind of pop Republicans and fun, fun, fun.
[53:21.000 --> 53:24.000]  And kind of, oh, we're nice to liberals. Come join our Big Tent.
[53:24.000 --> 53:28.000]  That just didn't seem hardcore to me, but now he's out there saying
[53:28.000 --> 53:33.000]  transgenderism is about transhumanism and about giving up on our humanity
[53:33.000 --> 53:36.000]  and becoming machines because that's really what it is.
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.000]  And now Steve Bannon gets it and everybody.
[53:38.000 --> 53:44.000]  And so we either get this or we get destroyed by it because it's real
[53:44.000 --> 53:47.000]  and it's going on and it's meant to destroy us.
[53:47.000 --> 53:51.000]  If you reach 18 years of age and you want to be a woman or you want to be a man
[53:51.000 --> 53:55.000]  or you want to, you know, whatever it is you want to be,
[53:55.000 --> 53:58.000]  for you being able to do that, that's your choice.
[53:58.000 --> 54:03.000]  But do not target children and brainwash them and then say they've made that decision
[54:03.000 --> 54:09.000]  before they're of age and then have the state come in and guide them into destruction and annihilation.
[54:09.000 --> 54:12.000]  So we'll get that Charlie Kirk clip as well.
[54:12.000 --> 54:15.000]  But I went on a rabbit trail.
[54:15.000 --> 54:19.000]  That's one reason Roger Stone's coming on the huge election fraud news.
[54:19.000 --> 54:24.000]  The big one is he is really upset about Russia and really upset about Biden trying to launch a war
[54:24.000 --> 54:31.000]  as his midterm election diversion and just where all this is going
[54:31.000 --> 54:35.000]  and the failure of Republicans to stand up against this.
[54:35.000 --> 54:39.000]  And we got polls out of 76 to 82 percent of Americans.
[54:39.000 --> 54:46.000]  Democrats, Republicans, you name it, do not want war and do not want to be on the doorstep of Russia
[54:46.000 --> 54:49.000]  starting a fight with them and moving heavy weapons in.
[54:49.000 --> 54:53.000]  I mean, imagine if Russia had moved five million dollars of weapons,
[54:53.000 --> 54:57.000]  any aircraft, any tank weapons, cluster bombs, you name it,
[54:57.000 --> 55:03.000]  right up to the Toronto-U.S. border with Niagara Falls.
[55:03.000 --> 55:09.000]  Or imagine if they'd moved it up to, say, South Texas.
[55:09.000 --> 55:12.000]  It's crazy, ladies and gentlemen, and now they're out there saying,
[55:12.000 --> 55:16.000]  oh, the invasion is coming any day, the war is about to start any day.
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.000]  Oh, they're going to stage an attack on their own troops.
[55:18.000 --> 55:20.000]  And Russia's like, no, we're not, no, we're not, no, we're not.
[55:20.000 --> 55:21.000]  You're massing weapons.
[55:21.000 --> 55:24.000]  We've put troops on our borders in case you launch an attack.
[55:24.000 --> 55:27.000]  It's clear you're about to launch an attack and you're saying we're going to launch an attack
[55:27.000 --> 55:31.000]  against ourselves as a pretext, which is a real thing that happens.
[55:31.000 --> 55:35.000]  But do you trust that the globalists are the ones starting the fight
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  or do you trust that it's the Russians doing it?
[55:37.000 --> 55:40.000]  I mean, who do you think is behind it?
[55:40.000 --> 55:43.000]  Who do you trust? Who do you not trust?
[55:43.000 --> 55:47.000]  And so it's very obvious to me with the history and the background
[55:47.000 --> 55:50.000]  and what they're doing and the proxy war already happening in Ukraine
[55:50.000 --> 55:53.000]  that the globalist forces are going to try to stage a provocation
[55:53.000 --> 55:57.000]  to get the Russians to fight back when the Russians get attacked.
[55:57.000 --> 56:03.000]  And then when the Russians fight back, they're going to say that the Russians attack themselves.
[56:03.000 --> 56:06.000]  Any footage the Russians show of any buildings that get blown up
[56:06.000 --> 56:09.000]  or any tanks that get blown up or any military bases that get attacked
[56:09.000 --> 56:14.000]  they're going to say that the Russians attack themselves.
[56:14.000 --> 56:16.000]  And that's how World War II started.
[56:16.000 --> 56:20.000]  Hitler attacked his own military base on the Polish border at Gliwitz in Operation Hemler.
[56:20.000 --> 56:23.000]  We'll cover it all with Roger Stone next hour.
[56:23.000 --> 56:26.000]  Don't forget, now is the time to get prepared.
[56:26.000 --> 56:30.000]  Now is the time to have your bug out plan and you need storable food.
[56:30.000 --> 56:34.000]  We have the highest quality storable food you're going to find at a really great price.
[56:34.000 --> 56:37.000]  You can find stuff that's better, that costs five times more.
[56:37.000 --> 56:39.000]  This is great food I've chosen for my family.
[56:39.000 --> 56:42.000]  The biggest company in the U.S. because they've got such quality.
[56:42.000 --> 56:45.000]  They're only 15 years old, but they're the biggest in the U.S. now
[56:45.000 --> 56:48.000]  because it's a great customer service, a great quality and great prices.
[56:48.000 --> 56:53.000]  And there for the first time in four years offering 25% off exclusively
[56:53.000 --> 56:59.000]  on the entire line of ready hour, my patriots supply at infowarstore.com
[56:59.000 --> 57:06.000]  or per paralogs.com takes you right to the sub page at infowarstore.com.
[57:06.000 --> 57:10.000]  Or prepare with alex.com and get 25% off.
[57:10.000 --> 57:13.000]  And they're not like me where I'll extend the sale a few days.
[57:13.000 --> 57:16.000]  They contractually with their other dealers and suppliers
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  because nobody else gets the steal but us.
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  So we're their biggest distributor out of thousands.
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  Nobody else gets it.
[57:22.000 --> 57:25.000]  So only until the 13th, it will run through midnight on the 13th,
[57:25.000 --> 57:29.000]  into the 14th, I'll probably twist the arm another day or so.
[57:29.000 --> 57:32.000]  But there's only five or six days left on this.
[57:32.000 --> 57:39.000]  In four wars, I guess seven, eight days left on this at infowarstore.com.
[57:39.000 --> 57:42.000]  And there's a lot of the great products at infowarstore.com as well.
[57:42.000 --> 57:43.000]  Stay with us.
[57:43.000 --> 58:11.000]  We'll be right back.
[58:11.000 --> 58:18.000]  Thanks for watching.
[58:42.000 --> 58:45.000]  To just be aware of the globals now they operate their tricks
[58:45.000 --> 58:48.000]  and to be aware of the fact that the universe is much larger
[58:48.000 --> 58:53.000]  and that God's there literally reaching out to you through free will.
[58:53.000 --> 58:58.000]  They are doing everything they can to block this information.
[58:58.000 --> 59:00.000]  So because of all their attempts to censor it and block it,
[59:00.000 --> 59:06.000]  we're offering it at 50% off for the first time and probably the only time ever.
[59:06.000 --> 59:13.000]  50% off on this seven-hour course, Mind Wars Spirit Wars at resetwars.com.
[59:13.000 --> 59:15.000]  The system wants you desperate.
[59:15.000 --> 59:16.000]  They want you alone.
[59:16.000 --> 59:17.000]  They want you depressed.
[59:17.000 --> 59:19.000]  They want you to feel like you're trapped in your five senses.
[59:19.000 --> 59:22.000]  They don't want you to know about the sixth sense or what.
[59:22.000 --> 59:24.000]  A lot of the ancients call the third eye.
[59:24.000 --> 59:25.000]  It's there.
[59:25.000 --> 59:26.000]  It's real.
[59:26.000 --> 59:31.000]  And this only gets you to focus with exercises and research and history
[59:31.000 --> 59:37.000]  and prayer to reconnect with the sixth sense, which is the conduit to the divine and God.
[59:37.000 --> 59:40.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, they do not want you to have Reset Wars.
[59:40.000 --> 59:46.000]  It is now exclusively available at 50% off for a limited time at resetwars.com.
[59:46.000 --> 59:47.000]  Resetwars.com.
[59:47.000 --> 1:00:13.000]  We'll start your journey of awakening today.
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  All right, Roger Stone's coming up next segment with a lot of huge breaking news and amazing insights.
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  But I want to play a clip of Charlie Kirk, who I have just seen as a nice guy, somewhat
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  effective with young people, but not very hardcore.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  But more and more every day I see him talking about the New World Order and transgenderism
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  really being a system for transhumanism and just the great reset in the New World Order.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  This is great news.
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  And so I guess turning point is having a turning point.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  I believe, and this is to go a level deeper, but you guys are smart and you'll get it,
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  the transgender movement actually matters even more than biomedical fascism and they actually are together
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  because the transgender movement is an introductory phase to get you to strip yourself of your humanity to mesh with machines.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  It's called transhumanism.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  They want you to say, OK, well, I can choose any gender.
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  Why can't I just have like an exoskeleton of some sort of machine around me?
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  This is what meta is about, the metaverse, kids staring at screens all day long.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  This is documented.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  This is proven.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  This is where Silicon Valley is going.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  This is why they're so insistent on this transgender thing, because if you stop being a man,
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  then maybe you can stop being a human being.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  Maybe you can kind of just plug into some sort of machine.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  This is where their control, their profit motive is coming down the stream.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  There's a ton of literature about this.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  I'm far from the first person to comment on it, but I'm just kind of connecting the dots for all of you.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  They might be like, what is the agenda here?
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  Well, the agenda is kind of like Ready Player One meets Inception,
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  where you kind of just hook up to a machine all day long,
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  and you're controlled by five companies that control your thoughts and your feelings,
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  and the real world actually ends up being the not real world,
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  where everyone just kind of wears goggles all day long.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  That's the deeper significance of the transgender movement that no one wants to talk about.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  David.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  Wow.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  That is better said than I can put it together.
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  Bravo.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  All right.
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  Now, Roger Stone is loaded for bear.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  I've known Roger for eight, nine years.
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  Six and a half years ago or so, but, man, he's really been on fire.
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  I've not just had him on my show and seen that.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  He's been on other shows.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  I've seen the clips, and he's going to get into a whole host of subjects,
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  Russia Gate 3.0, the war with Russia, the election fraud they're finding,
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  the canvassing finding out how many people voted but don't live at the house they're claiming they did.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  Big news there, but I wanted to play this clip of Peter Baker on MSNBC saying,
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  the Russians are the Alex Joneses of the world.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  So I tell you, at the State Department claiming that Russia is going to launch a false flag as the Alex Jones of the world,
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  but also the Russians are Alex Jones.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  Everybody's Alex Jones.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  We're all in Alex Jones territory now.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  Here it is.
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  Peter, the U.S. has released a lot of information about this alleged Russian threat,
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  including intelligence about an alleged fake video plot.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  It all seems so incredible.
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  You've covered Putin and Russia for a long time.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  Will releasing this information make a difference?
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  Well, I think you heard John Finers say that the idea is,
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  if we put out there that we know the United States knows that this is what they're going to do,
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  it won't damage any credibility.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  Such a false flag operation would have if they tried it,
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  and in fact deterrence through information.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  You know, look, the Russians are sort of the Alex Jones of world powers.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  They're a traffic and conspiracy theories.
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  They believe conspiracies by the West that are sort of far-fetched,
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  and they promote them through these sort of provocative actions at home.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  And remember, when they first went in and seized Crimea from Ukraine back in 2014,
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  they pretended that those men in green suits were not Russian troops,
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  when in fact, of course, they were.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  So this is all of normal practice out of Moscow.
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  And I think what you're seeing here by the United States is a way of trying to call them on it
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  in advance rather than after the fact trying to say, oh, well, that wasn't real.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  That was just fake.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  So there's been no, I mean, I don't know if they can,
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  I mean, release any kind of evidence of this thing happening, right?
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  Because it's so far what the U.S. is saying is,
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  they're planning the possibility of maybe doing a movie.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  Yeah, I think that's, you know, you heard a lot of discussion
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  by the State Department briefing yesterday, reporters pressing, of course,
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  Ned Price, the State Department spokesman for proof of this.
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  The United States government says, of course,
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  they don't want to do anything to compromise intelligence sources and methods.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  And, you know, look, it's...
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  So in the old days, Colin Powell would stand up there with fake anthrax,
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  or they'd show you some fake WMD images on the satellite.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  They don't even do that now.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  They just say, trust us, they're going to attack themselves
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  as U.S. forces mass on the Russian border.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  Okay, I mean, there's no end to this, folks.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  The Russians aren't attacking us.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  Joe Biden and the Globalist are.
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone.
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  The CEO of Pfizer just came out and said that
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  people talking bad about the vaccines are working for, quote, dark forces.
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  The FBI and CIA have been advising him on who these evil groups are.
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  They know that all over the world,
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:20.000]  their poison shot is being banned by major governments.
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  And Moderna's in trouble as well.
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  They know that the people are starting to get wise
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  this depopulation agenda.
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  In fact, evidence is starting to mount
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  that the shots were supposed to be soft-kill weapons,
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  but they're so deadly they're killing a higher percentage up front,
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  so people are waking up.
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  The weapons work a little too good.
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  They're supposed to be silent weapons for quiet wars,
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  but instead, they're making too big of a noise.
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  But it's too late for them to turn back now.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  They're coming after our children.
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  So it's up to us to protect our little children,
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  or God will not look favorably on us.
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:06:07.000]  However, God is watching.
[1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:12.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:16.000]  Well, he has not re-risen like the mythical phoenix,
[1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:19.000]  because he's never been killed.
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  But Roger Stone is definitely what we call punished.
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  On the Internet that shows myself,
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  Roger, Trump, and others as punished.
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  You know, eye patches, cuts on us, the rest of it.
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  But we are punished.
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  And by being punished, we have learned a lot,
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  and we've been through a lot.
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  We've got stronger, as Nietzsche said, along the way.
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  That which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  But because Roger is a stalwart and tough guy,
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  and I would think of myself as pretty tough as well,
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  we need to remind listeners that we are embattled.
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  We are under massive attack, and we need one thing first.
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  Your prayer, please.
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  It's real. I can feel it. I see it in my life.
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  Thank you, listeners. Please pray for us,
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  because they are coming after us again,
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  and coming down on us like 8,000-pound guerrillas.
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  Which is okay. We're big boys. We're not going to stop.
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  At many levels, we like it.
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  It makes us get up earlier in the morning and have more energy.
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  But for our children, for our wives, and for our country,
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  please pray for us, because we are the tip of the spear,
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  and we're just so damn effective thanks to the good gifts God gave us,
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  and you keeping us in the fight.
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  You are just as important as Roger, and I, and others at the Globalist,
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  and the Satanic Left hate, because you are keeping us in the fight,
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  and we salute you, and we thank you.
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  And you can see the all-out war to take OAN down,
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  and the all-out war to take down Mike Lindell,
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  the all-out war to silence Trump,
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  and the all-out war to silence Tucker Carlson, and now Joe Rogan.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  And if they can get us completely, they're going to get you.
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  De-platforming four years ago, then debanking, now they want us arrested.
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  Roger's been swat-teamed, okay?
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  They have gone to grand jury after grand jury,
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  and I don't say this like thumb in my nose,
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  like, ha-ha, you've gone to a bunch of grand juries to indict me, and they haven't.
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  I don't know, I'm not somebody that dances by graveyards.
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  No, I'm not feeling slick and feeling like, oh no, I'm like,
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  my God, we got a criminal government here.
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  And my lawyers are like, don't tell people what's been going on.
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  Let's just say this, I tell folks you better pray for us.
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  You might just, you know, see me in jail or dead with these people coming after us this bad.
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  Same with Roger. This isn't a game.
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  They're trying to start war with Russia right now.
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  So listen, I don't want to sit there and prove to you how serious this is
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  by us going off the air in six months because of finances.
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  I don't want to have to prove to you how serious this is by us losing the country
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  or having World War III with Russia.
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  I want to be peaceful, Democrat, Republican, all of us.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  This is the time to come together and say no to the multinational corporations
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  that have launched this new world order.
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  And they're playing us all against each other because I don't care if you're Republican,
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  a Democrat, gay, straight, live in Canada, live in Mexico, it doesn't matter.
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  The new world order, the great reset is not good for you.
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  You can wear the mask, go along with the shots, pretend you're part of the power structure,
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  but you're only engaged in the Stockholm syndrome.
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  So usually I ask for support at the end of an interview with Roger and myself,
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  but I'm just going to upfront say this.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  The way our finances work and with supply chains broken down,
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  now 25 weeks to get products,
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  I'm having to put the money in not six weeks before I get the product to have a manufacturer,
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  half the money.
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  I'm having to put it out 20 plus weeks.
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  So we got stuff coming in a few weeks that I've paid for 20 weeks ago.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  And then now I'm having to say, well, let's put it out 10 weeks and put it out 20 weeks.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  Because of that, we don't have the cash flow to do that to even be able to sell funds.
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  So I need everybody now to do things like get a reset wars membership and watch the course.
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  Because that doesn't have inventory.
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  It's digital and it's great material and it funds the operation 50% off.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  It's going to have to end Monday.
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  We've extended it since Friday, reset wars.com.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  I need you to go get t-shirts.
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  It's not as hard to get those.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  I get those in five weeks now when you start to get them in a week.
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  Get a book, get a film, get a DVD, get a water filtration, whatever we've got in stock.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  It's all great products.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  I'm telling you, I'm telling you that we're in the most grave situation ever.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  The whole country is the whole world.
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  You don't need me to tell you this.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  So they've got lying headlines about how I've got hundreds of millions of dollars,
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  all of its total fraud, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  None of it's true.
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  Infowarsstore.com, go there, support us and support our local M&F and affiliates as well.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  Because I need your support now.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  You need to get great products at the same time.
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  We have X3, but it's sold out for months and months.
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  It's back in stock.
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  All three good types of iodine.
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  Most people are deficient in it.
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  This is an amazing product.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  It's back in stock 50% off so much more.
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  Please keep us on the air because we're entering our most critical time.
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  Look at what they're doing with Rogan, with Carlson, all of this.
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  But we're staying at our stations and fighting.
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  But Roger and I have gone further in the persecution arc than basically everybody else.
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  And that's for a reason.
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  So I wanted to up front before we hit Russia, before we hit all this news, talk about that.
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  How serious is this information?
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  I know where you're at, Roger, as well.
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  And how do people support you with the congressional subpoenas and the IRS attacks?
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  And everything they do because they see you as a prize.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  If they can take you out, the left is going to run around like they've captured a Roman standard celebrating their winning.
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  Taking us down is very important to the Satanic New World Order.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  Alex, you're absolutely right.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  They don't want me or you on the ramparts leading this fight.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  I have to comment on that clip you just showed.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  The idea of anyone from the New York Times accusing us of being conspiracy theorists is laughable.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  I mean, first of all, Peter Baker works for the New York Times, so New York Times.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  Therefore, by definition, literally nothing he says is true or accurate.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  But just to remind you, he was one of the major progenitors of the Russian collusion hoax,
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  which we now know, based on declassified documents, never took place.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  Peter, waiting for your apology, waiting for your retraction.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  It's an absurd for them to call us conspiracy theorists.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  It's right out of the Alinsky book. They are the ones who are conspiracy theorists.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  That's right. I just want to upfront, Roger, because I know you hadn't been a big lobbyist for 25 years.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  You were a book author. You lost your house. You lost everything.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  You're not a victim. You're a champion that we've got to keep in the game and keep in the fight.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  As you know, like the equivalent of a top quarterback has played 30 seasons. It's like impossible.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  40 seasons. I've been in this 28 seasons. So you've been in it on what, 45, 50 seasons?
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  How do people support you? How do people keep you in the game?
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  Well, not only do I have the January 6th hoax to contend with,
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  but I still have six remaining, totally baseless, harassment, but sensationalized, phony civil lawsuits,
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  including one by the Biden Justice Department. You can go to StoneDefenseFun.com, StoneDefenseFun.com.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  Unfortunately, I do still need the help of patriots in the Infra-Warrior community.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  Well, that's right, Roger. I mean, I know you're down to one half broken car, and I don't want to embarrass you.
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  That's what's going on. Let's expand on this, because we're not bitching, folks.
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  You've got to keep the Warriors in the fight. You forgot. You have the Capitol Police suing you for running January 6th.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  I mean, you had nothing to do with it. I mean, that's just people. You're like, well, just don't, folks,
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  they come at you with George Town University and the CIA are suing me.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  They admittedly run law clinic, the Virginia lawsuit against us. This is not a frickin' game.
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  And we understand it's all rigged. We've just got to fight through the whole process,
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  or they'd shut us down right now. They would send in the local constables and literally take the equipment and turn our lights off.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  Okay, I had to fight right through the crooked thing, right through the rigged courts, right through battling them for years in the courts,
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  and all of this just to stay on the air. We know it's all rigged, but while they're biting us and attacking us and clawing at us,
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  like gremlins, we just stay in the fight with our guns, blasting at the New World Order.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  Sorry, Roger, I'm ranting.
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  That's perfectly right. Alex, at the very top, this morning I spoke at the River Church in Tampa with Pastor Rodney Howard Brown,
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  who asked me to tell you of his high regard for you and the fact that he is praying for you specifically,
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  because he knows exactly what kind of attack you're under.
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  So I want to pass on his best regard.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  Well, God bless you, and I apologize for getting you on on Sunday night and making you sit there 10 minutes while I ran it.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  You'll have the floor, I promise, on Russia, on the canvassing about election fraud that you've discovered.
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  That's big news. You'll have it when we all come back.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  I just wanted to upfront let listeners know that they don't normally hear me at the start of the interview call for support,
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  but it's that damn serious.
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  We aren't going to back down. We aren't going to give up, but we could give out, Roger.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  So how do people support you again? How do they get a Roger Stone, did nothing wrong shirt?
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  How do they get your books? How do they find Roger Stone paraphernalia, as the left calls it?
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  Again, you can go to StoneColdTruth.com, go to the shop.
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  StoneColdTruth.com, go to the shop.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  You can get your iconic Roger Stone, did nothing wrong t-shirt.
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  Or you can get a signed presidential pardon, or you can get one of my famous Roger Stones paper weights.
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  Or if you just want to help me in the legal battle and I need the help, you can go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  But also, you've heard me say this before, Infowars is indeed the tip of the spear.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  Infowars drives the left crazy because we adhere to the truth.
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  So get over there to the Infowars store, by the way, that iodine product,
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  I believe helped bring me back from the Chinese virus.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  It's the best iodine product out there. It's back in stock. That's the good news.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  Go online right now and buy it.
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  Absolutely folks, we're doing our most important work yet and you are keeping us on air.
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:56.000]  We'll be right back with the Hardcore News. Stay with us.
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  God created each and every one of us with free will.
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:12.000]  When we look at the world system now, openly announcing the Mark of the Beast, everything that it's attempting to do is built around getting rid of our free will
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  and making us bow down and submit and turn our very bodies, our very productivity, our very genetics, our very future over to them.
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  They want control of procreation. They want control of the relationships between men and women.
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  They want to bring a form of living death to our society and our civilization.
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  All of us were formed and made in God's mind, in God's image and given free will.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:45.000]  And make no mistake, all of you alive today were created by God to be alive in this special time
[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:50.000]  so that you could make the right decision in free will and stand against evil.
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  And then, for eternity, win the great birthright prize of being aligned with God.
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  This is a great sponsor. We have one of the best deals you're going to find out there on a high-quality, high-rated satellite phone.

[1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:37.000]  Again, thank you so much for joining us on this live Sunday, February 6 broadcast.
[1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:51.000]  Long time Republican political operative, former top political advisor to President Trump, famously pardoned for a crime he didn't commit by President Trump, joins us now.
[1:20:51.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  And he's got a lot to say from his research and his contacts, and he is working for multiple administrations about what he really thinks is happening with this Russia crisis.
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:06.000]  We saw Bloomberg on Friday announced that Russia had attacked, then later say, sorry, fake headline.
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  We've seen the State Department and the CIA say, just trust us, we know they're going to attack themselves.
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  And we say, give us proof.
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  And they said, that is the proof.
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  So they've gone from Colin Powell who'd hold up anthrax, at least he'd show some fake anthrax.
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  That was all a lie, but at least he showed some type of prop.
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  Here, they're not even bothering to try to plant something or make something up.
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:35.000]  Roger Stone, what's your view on the situation and how imminent do you think war is or can it be averted?
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:38.000]  Well, Alex, I'm going to tell you the stone cold truth.
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:39.000]  I know how this works.
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:43.000]  As soon as I tell you what's really going on, the fake news media is going to say, oh, right.
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  They say, oh, Roger Stone and Alex Jones, they're puppets for Putin.
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:49.000]  They're Russian spokesmen.
[1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  They're Russian traders.
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  No, my family members were mowed down by Russian tanks in Budapest in 1956.
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  I abhor the Russian system.
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  It's a brutal totalitarian system.
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  However, this rush to war in which the Biden administration is going to endanger hundreds of thousands of lives.
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:17.000]  Americans, Russians, Ukrainians is completely avertable.
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  They would like us to believe that Putin wants to take over all of Ukraine and install a puppet government so that he can restore the faded glory of the great Soviet Union.
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  First of all, he can't even economically afford that.
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  Secondarily, let us listen to what he is saying over and over and over again.
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  When he says he doesn't want Ukraine to join NATO, what he is saying is he doesn't want Western missiles on his border.
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  This is identical to what President John F. Kennedy said in 1962 when he said he did not want Russian missiles 90 miles off the shore of the United States.
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  This is all about that and he said it over and over again, but that gets extrapolated to he wants to take over Ukraine.
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  I don't believe so.
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:21.000]  If Ukraine would merely agree, essentially, not to put missiles on the border of Russia, this entire thing could be averted.
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  By the way, that's what happened in 1962.
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  John Kennedy basically got the Russians, he made a pledge not to invade Cuba.
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  In return, they agreed to remove their missiles and then we learned later that the United States removed some missiles from Turkey and Italy.
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  And war, world war and massive deaths were averted.
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:53.000]  And back then they showed us the photos of the missiles and the weapons and the Russians got embarrassed and had to admit it.
[1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:55.000]  And here we're given no proof.
[1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  And again, this is our weapons in the Russian theater, not the other way around.
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  Well, but let's also be clear about what's going on here.
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:05.000]  This is one of the all-time classics.
[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:07.000]  It's diversion.
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  Don't look over here at what the Chinese are doing.
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  Don't look at the way they've corrupted the first family and the way they have paid Hunter Biden.
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  Don't look at the way they are systematically buying up farmland and real estate all over America.
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that they had several hundred thousand acres.
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  Alex, they have 300,000 of ranch and farmland in Oklahoma alone.
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  So don't look at the way they're manipulating our currency.
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  Don't look at the way they are threatening our American flag vessels in the South China Sea.
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  No, no, look over here at Russia and Ukraine.
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  This is a diversion.
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  They are on the precipice of a horrific war that would be avertable through diplomacy if anybody would just listen to what Putin is saying.
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  But instead, you have the drums of war.
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  It's bipartisan, by the way.
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  It's Republicans and Democrats.
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  It's the same neocons who would lead us to a totally unnecessary war.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  No, I'm not an apologist for Putin.
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  No, I don't like the Russian system, but I do think that war is avertable here if through diplomacy.
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:25.000]  On the other hand, here's the backdrop.
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  Only yesterday they announced that all of the sanctions Donald Trump put in place against Iran have been lifted.
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  So every time we show the world weakness in our foreign policy, well, Iraq is raining missiles on Israel.
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  The North Koreans have restarted their nuclear weapons development program.
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  The Russians are obviously on the border here prepared to make a move because they don't think that we will take their insistence of not putting missiles on their border seriously.
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  You have, as I said earlier, the Chinese harassing American flag ships in the South China Sea.
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  That would never happen under President Donald Trump.
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  And of course, you have the fiasco in Afghanistan where we were correct to remove our troops.
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  That's a continuation of a Trump administration policy, removing our troops from the endless foreign wars where we have no inherent interests.
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  But we left behind $86 billion worth of sophisticated military equipment, making Iran the fourth best equipped military on the face of the planet.
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  And let me just go back to what you just said. The State Department is showing $5 billion in a bunch of different shipments in the last month,
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  being delivered every week with javelin missiles, anti-tank missiles, anti-aircraft missiles, really class A weapons are being delivered and masked.
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  And we know U.S. Special Forces are there because I know some of the guys that are there.
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  Already in proxy wars, a little green man, 14,000 people already killed in the east of Ukraine in this proxy war. And so clearly the West is accelerating the conflict,
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  I think as a political distraction, as you said, from China, from Iran, from Afghanistan, and also the election coming up, the midterms.
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  I think that's exactly on the money. At this point, my sources in the Pentagon, and I still have some, tell me that they doubt war can be averted.
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  They are hell bent on war, but it is based on a false premise. This could be a diverted via diplomatic relations and diplomatic negotiations.
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  I think Putin could not be more clear that he just doesn't want Western missiles on his border.
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  So it is the same big government, Democrat, media cabal now beating the drum for war. They are war happy.
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  And maybe people will forget about the energy prices. Maybe people will forget about what they're paying at the gas pump.
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  Since we had absolute energy independence under President Trump, and now we're back to buying oil from who?
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  Americans and the Saudis. Gee, how about that?
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  This is just insane. And of course, who benefits the globalist from destabilization?
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  So they go from the great reset with the two years of COVID lockdown into a new war with supply chains breaking down even faster.
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  A whole bunch of Ford plants are now closing, maybe forever they're saying, through the persistent supply chain disruptions.
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  That's not from the virus. It's from the hysteria and the lockdowns from the virus.
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  I'm Roger Stone and talk more about the upcoming election and massive election fraud and all sorts of other chicanery,
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  which is being very well documented and that is now unfolding.
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  Stay with us at ImpleWars.com. Tomorrow's news today.
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:04.000]  I really regret it when I forget to take high quality iodine supplements.
[1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:15.000]  It is the good halogen. The UN admits two billion plus people have cognitive disabilities on the face of the earth today.
[1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:21.000]  That's over 20% because they have had iodine deficiencies.
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  Now we've got two different great iodine products. We've got X2. It's amazing.
[1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:30.000]  Pure deep earth crystal atomic iodine. And it's been sold out for a while.
[1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  We finally got X3 back in that is the deep earth crystal iodine and then two other types because some studies show it helps with the absorption of the pure iodine.
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:47.000]  So it's apples and oranges. Both formulas are excellent. People constantly ask me, including on the street, what's better, X2 or X3?
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:54.000]  Apples and oranges. It's like, do you like iceberg lettuce or do you like spinach?
[1:29:54.000 --> 1:30:03.000]  It's two different things. It's like a tomato versus a potato. Bottom line, your body needs iodine.
[1:30:03.000 --> 1:30:10.000]  And the globalists are bombarding all of us with bad halogens, fluoride, bromine, chloride.
[1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:17.000]  All of those systems that block fertility, block our electrochemical cells, block our immune system.
[1:30:17.000 --> 1:30:26.000]  Just on the immune system front, so many people have deficiencies in iodine. So X3 is back in stock.
[1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:34.000]  It's been sold out for four months at 50% off. So for your libido, your stamina, your energy, everything, try X3 today.
[1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:39.000]  And for all the fans of it, well, it's back in stock. Please get yours and keep M4s on the air.

[1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:56.000]  They work. Infowarstore.com, or 941-955-1029-4195-1020 and ask the Alex Jones Special.
[1:31:56.000 --> 1:32:06.000]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on both at home and the world at large.
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:14.000]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep support formula, down and out, is just the thing.
[1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:21.000]  It's our new faster-absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:32.000]  Formulated to improve upon our best-selling product, Knockout, with down and out, now the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:37.000]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:47.000]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower, which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees, who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:53.000]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will be down and out.
[1:32:53.000 --> 1:33:19.000]  Selling it out now at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:24.000]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  The world is exciting, and exciting things are going on, and they're trying to start nuclear war with Russia, and we could all die.
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  And it take a few months after the fallout, as our gums bleed out and our guts bleed out, and I don't want to be there with my dying children.
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  I'd like to not blow up this planet we're on.
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:10.000]  See, I'm excited about things that matter.
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  People say, why aren't you excited about football or basketball or baseball?
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:15.000]  Because those things don't matter.
[1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:19.000]  And yeah, I used to 30 years ago get excited about it, but now I know that's a diversion.
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  I'm not judging you if you like that, but people paint their faces up and they yell and scream at football games.
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:29.000]  I get up here on air and yell and scream trying to stop a new giant war.
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  I mean, we have collapsing cities.
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:33.000]  We have massive inflation.
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  We have things degenerating everywhere.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:37.000]  We have incredible fentanyl deaths.
[1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:42.000]  I mean, I know a whole bunch of people whose teenagers have died in Austin.
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:51.000]  I don't just read it in the newspaper where they find some 11-year-old with 100 bags of fentanyl in New Haven, Connecticut, who was dead from fentanyl and two of his other friends almost died.
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:53.000]  And they're in middle school.
[1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  That's what pisses me off.
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  And Roger Stone is angry about it as well, and he's fired up.
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  And we want to get you fired up in that fight.
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  And we know you're tuned in because you are fired up.
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  We've got to get other people fired up.
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  And that's starting to happen.
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  Roger, finishing up on the Russian situation, what can listeners do?
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:13.000]  What can citizens do?
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  Be like Josh Hawley, be like Tucker Carlson, call out the neocon Republicans.
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  I mean, because they're there saying, it's imminent, get ready.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  Clearly they want to go to war at any time.
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  They want to use an attack on the Russians to then say they false flagged themselves.
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  I mean, this is just a disaster we're facing.
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  And then people ask me, why are you so upset?
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:33.000]  It's just crazy.
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:36.000]  You know, Alex, you just put up an extraordinary story.
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi says we're not ruling out a first nuclear strike over Ukraine.
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:47.000]  This is just beyond belief.
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  No, I think that people need to let their senators and their congressmen know
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  that they are not foregoing to war when war can be averted.
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  This is a dangerous game that the Biden administration is playing.
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  This could result in hundreds of thousands of deaths.
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:07.000]  And it is entirely unnecessary.
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  Now, I understand that we are going to be attacked relentlessly after this broadcast as Russian stooges, Russian spies.
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  No, we love America and we don't want to go to war unless our inherent national interests are present.
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  They are not present here.
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  Can you imagine the Biden administration saying this is about borders, protecting the Ukrainian border?
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  What about America's border?
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  We saw last week in Florida two luxury buses in Maitland, Florida pull up to a hotel.
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  We saw a number of illegal immigrants, all by the way, males, somewhere between 18 and 25 by and large,
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  each one of them being given preloaded credit cards,
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  each one of them being given a passcode for a room in a hotel.
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  Now, by law, you can't get a room in a hotel unless you can show a driver's license or some other legal ID.
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  How is this happening?
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  Our great governor, Ron DeSantis, specifically said that if the Biden administration sent illegals to this state,
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  he would send them packing to Delaware and California, where Biden and Kamala Harris are from.
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  And I'd like to see him keep that pledge.
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  We've already seen evidence that they aren't flying illegals from Afghanistan,
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  Afghani refugees into Jacksonville, Florida,
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  because unfortunately one of them went out and murdered an American citizen.
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:41.000]  So again, I call on our governor to walk the walk.
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  Don't just talk the talk.
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  We cannot have this flow of illegals.
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  I agree.
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:49.000]  He's got to deport them all to Martha's Vineyard now.
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  That's a great idea. He must deport them to Martha's Vineyard.
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  I'm all for it.
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  But in the meantime, spoke to a great conference yesterday in Tampa put on by Defend Florida.
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  And Alex, there's just no question.
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  There are 1.6 million phantom voters on the Florida voter rolls.
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:15.000]  Now, if you don't live in Florida, why should you care?
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  I'll tell you why you should care.
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  Because no Republican will be elected president of the United States
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  without carrying the sunshine state.
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  This is the most important swing state,
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  and it's the state that Donald Trump did best of of all the swing states.
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  So it's not that there wasn't voter fraud in the last election in Florida.
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  There was.
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  They just didn't steal enough.
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  They did not foresee Donald Trump coming out of Miami-Dade County,
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:45.000]  the southernmost county in the state, the largest county in the state, even.
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  No Republican comes out of there even.
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:51.000]  Generally speaking, you want to lose that county 60-40,
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  and if you do, you're going to win statewide by getting the normal Republican vote.
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  And Roger explained, because we saw this in Texas and Florida,
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  where they had a pool of dead people voting.
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:04.000]  They had a pool of people that were out of state still voting.
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  And as soon as they ran out of that pool,
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  suddenly you didn't see in the last election the number tracking the same in 2020,
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  and then suddenly Trump surges ahead.
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:17.000]  So we're seeing this over and over again,
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:21.000]  and we saw in California large portions of Republicans going and trying to vote,
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  and somebody had already voted in their name.
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  Yeah, there's no question.
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  This is pretty easy to prove.
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  Put aside those who voted on Election Day in Florida.
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:34.000]  Put aside those who voted by absentee ballot.
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  Put aside those who voted in early voting.
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  Just focus on those who voted by mail.
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:45.000]  Now, if you go visit 20,000 of those households,
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  and you find that 20% of them do not exist,
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  meaning they moved, they died, it's a vacant lot,
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  there's no residence there, there's no evidence that they ever exist to begin with,
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:03.000]  and then you use the law of mathematical probability
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:07.000]  to project it on the millions who voted by mail in ballot.
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  You come up with the undeniable conclusion that there are over one million
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  phantom voters on our rolls.
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  Politifact says I'm wrong.
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  No, I say they're wrong.
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  They're denying math.
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  Bad enough when they deny science.
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  Now they're denying math.
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  This is simple math.
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  So we need an audit of our election rolls,
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  not because Donald Trump lost the state,
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  but because we are drowning in voters that don't exist.
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  This isn't just happening in Florida.
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  It's happened in Arizona.
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  It's happened in Georgia.
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  We saw a story last week, undeniable.
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  There's over 100,000 voters in Wisconsin who voted in the last election
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:51.000]  who are all over 100 years old.
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  Not possible, not possible.
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  You know, this is a huge dichotomy between the grassroots
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  and the leaders of the Republican Party.
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  The leaders of the party, the rhinos,
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  they want this issue to go away.
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  But at the grassroots, I can tell you,
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:11.000]  it is first and foremost on the minds of Republican voters,
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  and they get reminded of it every time they go to the gas pump,
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  or every time they read about our leaving $86 billion worth of equipment
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  in Afghanistan.
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  I totally agree, Roger.
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  Let me share the numbers from Texas and Florida.
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  I know you're a political expert,
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  and I mean, I'm not.
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  I've just seen the numbers.
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  I want your take as we go to break on this.
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  You have the voter rolls, and it's the same graph.
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  Trump wins and just keeps going through in the night.
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  But with Biden in Florida and in Texas,
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  it just keeps tracking right next to Trump,
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  because they want to be able to right at the end,
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  put an extra and go above him, and then suddenly it just ends.
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  And suddenly there's like no more voters, and it drops off,
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  which again, you don't see graphs like that.
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  Then in Pennsylvania, Georgia and other areas,
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  it's the other way where Trump's here, Biden's here, they wait,
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:00.000]  they have plenty of votes, and they steal it in the middle of the night
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  and then go straight up where they need to be.
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  So I mean, these graphs, you don't see unless there's fraud, correct?
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  That's exactly right.
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:09.000]  You're looking in Pennsylvania, it's very simple.
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:13.000]  It was the Republicans who legalized mail-in ballots,
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  which are specifically unconstitutional
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  under their state constitution.
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  So the rhinos did it to themselves.
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  See, they were so sure that Donald Trump was going to lose Pennsylvania,
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  they were trying to save themselves.
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  But Donald Trump ended up running way ahead of them.
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  I believe he carried this day.
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  Absolutely.
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  Alright, final segment with Roger Stone.
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  I want to get into the midterms more.
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  I want to talk about January 6th, because even all the big Republicans admit
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  they go to events with thousands of people, hundreds of people.
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  No one wants to hear about Jan 6th.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  They care about inflation, imploding borders, and the incompetence of Biden,
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:47.000]  and war.
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  They don't want war.
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  They want jobs.
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  They want security.
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:51.000]  They want a future.
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  Same thing with Democrat voters.
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:58.000]  So what are the Democrats going to do when they're running on Jan 6th?
[1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:00.000]  Sold out for months.
[1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:02.000]  X3 is now back in stock.
[1:43:02.000 --> 1:43:05.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game-changing,
[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  our products are game-changing,
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:10.000]  and so many people are deficient in iodine.
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:12.000]  It's not the soil anymore.
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:14.000]  Most of the ocean is contaminated.
[1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:17.000]  But when you get high-quality iodine,
[1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:19.000]  all three of the healthy types together,
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido,
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:25.000]  but most importantly, your immune system.
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:29.000]  So, X3, the only tri-iodine on the market,
[1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:33.000]  highest grade, is now exclusively available again at 50% off
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:35.000]  at mforeshore.com.
[1:43:35.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine,
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:40.000]  and what it does for your body, it takes about two weeks to get on average,
[1:43:40.000 --> 1:43:43.000]  you really need to experience X3.
[1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:46.000]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:49.000]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:51.000]  because it's amazing what does for your body.
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:53.000]  It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen,
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  and it funds the info or a true 360 win.
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:43:59.000]  So again, X3 back in stock, 50% off at limited time.
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:04.000]  Most people will tell you you need three things to safely own a firearm
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:07.000]  so you can protect yourself, your business, and your family.
[1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:11.000]  They'll tell you you need training, you need a firearm, and you need ammunition.
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:14.000]  But you also need insurance,
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:16.000]  just like with a car or with a house,
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:20.000]  you need to have what Kyle Rittenhouse didn't have
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:24.000]  when he defended himself and others and was found not guilty.
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:27.000]  It took him millions of dollars to defend himself.
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:32.000]  How can the average person rest assured that while they're protecting their family,
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:35.000]  their business, and their own lives, that they're safe?
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:39.000]  You do that with high quality insurance that protects you
[1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  when you use the firearm to defend yourself, your property, or your family.
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  This is something that is so incredibly important.
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:50.000]  Now, there's a lot of companies out there offering insurance, a lot of great companies.
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:55.000]  But the Palmetto State Armoury is moving very, very strongly into this market
[1:44:55.000 --> 1:44:58.000]  with the best package out there that we found.
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:02.000]  This is real certified insurance at an incredibly low price.
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  The plans start at just $10.95 a month,
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:10.000]  up to $2 million of coverage with multiple levels of protection to choose from.
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:15.000]  Depending on which tier you sign up for, you get between $20 and $100 on your gift card
[1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  for simply signing up for the first month.
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:21.000]  And you are promoting an organization that is pro-gun, pro-second amendment,
[1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:23.000]  pro-free speech, and pro-America.
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:26.000]  Here's an example of insurance in your life.
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:29.000]  We've been covering anticoviolence for many years,
[1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:33.000]  and they've gotten so vicious we had to buy an armored vehicle three years ago
[1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:36.000]  to just go out and cover the events.
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  This is a form of insurance, and it costs a lot more than the very low prices
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:43.000]  at ProtectWithAlex.com.
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  You need the insurance of ProtectWithAlex.com to sleep securely at night knowing
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:54.000]  you're prepared and have up to $2 million of coverage ready to protect your life and your liberty.
[1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:57.000]  Go to ProtectWithAlex.com today and become a member.
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:46:07.000]  And I want to thank you for your support.
[1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:56.000]  Thank you.
[1:46:57.000 --> 1:47:07.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:31.000]  No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip.
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:40.000]  The stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip, big iron on his hip.
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:45.000]  It was early in the morning when he rode into the town.
[1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:51.000]  I cannot stress enough the blisters of yours how brave the situation is worldwide.
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  And I don't do that to scare you.
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  I don't do that to really get everybody to understand that if we don't politically hold the neocons
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:05.000]  and the psychotic Democrats feet to the damn fire, they're going to start a major war with Russia.
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  They already say it's imminent.
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  And then the Sidney Rack folks, okay?
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:11.000]  This is crazy town.
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  And they're censoring everybody.
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:16.000]  They're demanking everybody.
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:22.000]  They're making major moves because the globalist great reset New World Order system
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  is in trouble all over the world with major governments.
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:27.000]  People are learning about it very quickly.
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  They've stolen quadrillions of money through fiat banking.
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:33.000]  They're crashing the system.
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:40.000]  And they need viruses and wars and cyber attacks that they control as the diversion of the distraction
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  to be our saviors while they actually conquer the world through financial fraud and warfare.
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  That's why the learning curve on this is so important.
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  But thank God, I'm seeing it everywhere now.
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  Being discussed by top scientists and lawyers and major leaders and Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  and all these other people now talking about the great reset.
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:03.000]  It's the corporate cabals.
[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:05.000]  It's the other power structure.
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  There's China.
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  There's Russia.
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:09.000]  There's the United States.
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:10.000]  There's the European Union.
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  There's the Islamist.
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  But what's bigger than all that together?
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  The big corporations manipulating it all above the law.
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  We never think about being conquered by them.
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  That's what the great reset is.
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:24.000]  So please go to resetwars.com today.
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  It is a seven hour course on Mind Wars Spirit Wars.
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  How to mentally get ready for this.
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:33.000]  This is real technology that God gave us.
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  A lot of this is well known.
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:35.000]  A lot of it's not well known.
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  And the course is 50% off.
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:38.000]  We're only running it until tomorrow.
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  And then I'm going to end the 50% off.
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:42.000]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  Please go to resetwars.com and watch the course.
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  And I want to thank everybody that has gotten it.
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  And everybody, please support Roger Stone.
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  It's stonedefencefund.com.
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  Just like myself, the committee is coming after you.
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  He's got all these other groups after him.
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  And if you want us to fight, we will.
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  But we don't have George Soros paying our bills.
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  So again, the best websites,
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:05.000]  Roger Stone for folks to be able to support you
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  if they want to keep us in the fight.
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  Stonedefencefund.com.
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  There it is.
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:12.000]  Stonedefencefund.com.
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:15.000]  I still got to fight six completely baseless
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:19.000]  harassment lawsuits being financed by George Soros
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  or in one case by the Biden Justice Department.
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  These are civil suits.
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  Business Insider said last week it was a criminal suit.
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  No, these are civil suits.
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  They're baseless.
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  But if you don't go fight them,
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  they get a judgment against you.
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  Already lost enough.
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  Alex, I've got to be honest with you.
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:39.000]  I'm just happy to be back on my feet
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  because I got bowled over by the Chinese virus.
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  And it was 10 times worse than I thought it would be.
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  And yes, I did ultimately make a comeback
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:53.000]  thanks to ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:50:56.000]  But in the meantime, I started doing my own research
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  and your iodine product, X2 and X3,
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  absolutely crucial in terms of rebuilding your immunity.
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  Now, just in case anybody's wondering,
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:11.000]  no, I'm not paid a penny to say this, not a penny.
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:14.000]  I talk about these products on the infowars store
[1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  because they work.
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  You see, you could go to Amazon,
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:21.000]  you go to the vitamin shop, you go to a lot of places,
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  and you can buy similar products or similar sounding products.
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  Here's what I know firsthand.
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:31.000]  And that is Alex Jones and the folks he works with
[1:51:31.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  use only the best ingredients in the purest form
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:38.000]  and at dosages that will actually help you.
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:41.000]  It's all natural. Everything's all natural.
[1:51:41.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  But I really believe the iodine played a crucial role
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:47.000]  in getting me back on my feet.
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:49.000]  Well, I'm just glad that,
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:52.000]  I knew you already had it and had ordered it and gotten some before,
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  but I'm glad that you went and did research and looked at it
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:57.000]  because there's so much that iodine does with the immune system,
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:51:59.000]  both internally but also topically.
[1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:02.000]  And like Dr. McCullough was on about all the big studies,
[1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  about a tiny bit of it in water
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:06.000]  and then inhaled into the nasal cavity
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  is just amazing.
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  So I hope folks find out about it
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:13.000]  and support the broadcast with X3 at infowarstore.com.
[1:52:13.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  Roger, in the five, six months we have left here,
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  thank you so much for spending Sunday evening with us.
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  Jan 6, you heard my question before the break.
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:23.000]  The Democrats are just all in betting everything on this,
[1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:25.000]  but the polls, the research, the numbers show
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:27.000]  their constituents are sick of it.
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:29.000]  Republicans don't want to hear about it.
[1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:31.000]  This is just crazy.
[1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  No, there's no there, there.
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:35.000]  First of all, we learned last week definitively
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:38.000]  that the massive doors to the Capitol
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:41.000]  that can only be opened from the inside
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:43.000]  were in fact opened from the inside.
[1:52:43.000 --> 1:52:45.000]  And now there's a new smear
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:47.000]  against that great American patriot,
[1:52:47.000 --> 1:52:49.000]  General Michael Flynn.
[1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  It is alleged that there was a draft of a memo
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:55.000]  that talked about seizing the machines.
[1:52:55.000 --> 1:52:57.000]  A draft, a draft that was never acted on.
[1:52:57.000 --> 1:52:59.000]  In fact, as I understand it,
[1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:01.000]  General Flynn's reaction to the memo was,
[1:53:01.000 --> 1:53:03.000]  somebody needs to run this by the lawyers
[1:53:03.000 --> 1:53:05.000]  and see if it's even legal.
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  I mean, if I thought about murdering someone,
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:09.000]  but then I don't murder them,
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:11.000]  can I be prosecuted for murder?
[1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  Of course not.
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:15.000]  Now you're being prosecuted for bought crimes.
[1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  Let's be clear.
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:19.000]  General Flynn did not recommend martial law.
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  General Flynn did not recommend the Insurrection Act.
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:27.000]  General Flynn did not recommend the seizing of the machines.
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  General Flynn had the same position I did,
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:32.000]  that you did a 10-day delay
[1:53:32.000 --> 1:53:35.000]  so that the individual states could examine
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  the anomalies and the irregularities in the election.
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:42.000]  This hatchet job in the New York Times
[1:53:42.000 --> 1:53:46.000]  by this fellow draper is an outrage.
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:47.000]  I'm sorry.
[1:53:47.000 --> 1:53:49.000]  I've seen the attacks on him online.
[1:53:49.000 --> 1:53:50.000]  I'm not buying it.
[1:53:50.000 --> 1:53:53.000]  General Michael Flynn is one of the finest Christian gentlemen
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:53:54.000]  I've ever met.
[1:53:54.000 --> 1:53:56.000]  He is an actual war hero.
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  If you look at his record,
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:03.000]  and I believe his greatest days of public service lie ahead.
[1:54:03.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  I'm sick and tired of people dumping on this guy.
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:08.000]  He is a true patriot.
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  And these smears are very clear.
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:12.000]  Why did they smear General Flynn?
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  I'll tell you why.
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  Because they fear him.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:19.000]  Because as the former director of intelligence,
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  he knows where the bodies are buried.
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  He knows what the Chinese are up to.
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  He knows what the North Koreans are up to.
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  He knows what's really going on in Ukraine.
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  He's been among the most articulate voices of saying,
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  stop this rush to war and let's work this out
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  by not agreeing to put Western missiles
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  on the border of Russia.
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  The identical position of President John Kennedy in 1962.
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  So I'm praying every day that we do not go to war
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  because I'm a libertarian Republican.
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  I'm a Rand Paul Republican when you get right down to it.
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:55:01.000]  But you can see the drumbeat of the Democrat media cabal.
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  Don't look over here at what the Chinese are doing.
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  Look over here.
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  Putin wants to take over the country and insert a puppet government.
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:11.000]  That's not what he's saying.
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  I don't think that is his aim.
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  And if you want to go call me a Russian spy
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  or a Russian loyalist or a Russian trader,
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  that's nonsense too.
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:24.000]  I'm in America. I love America.
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:26.000]  This is not good for America.
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  Well, I've really had a chance to be there at January 6th
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  and to see it from all the different angles.
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  And I know what happened now.
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  And I'm going to make a short documentary sometime next week
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:37.000]  or the week after that's just like 10 minutes long
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:39.000]  that here's definitive what happened.
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  It was surrounded by commandos.
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  They ordered the police to stand down.
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  They had some anti-provocateurs.
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  Some other leftists they're directing people in.
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:49.000]  The riot cops attacked some people.
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:52.000]  The provocateurs and some folks got caught up emotionally
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:55.000]  and involved and also helped the anti-folk.
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  And they went in and all this went on.
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  But we have to remember, Pelosi was saying,
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:03.000]  Trump will be removed by maybe even the insurrection act.
[1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  She said, we'll have martial law.
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  Even if he wins the election, we're not going to accept it.
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:09.000]  We're going to hold our own inauguration.
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  They said that we'd have a civil war in the New York Times.
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  So they raised the temperature,
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:17.000]  burned down billions of dollars in buildings,
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:19.000]  attacked police.
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  The vice president who later became vice president
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:25.000]  was bailing murderers and criminals out of jail.
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  And then out of a million people,
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:29.000]  a couple hundred fight the police,
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  a few thousand get waved into the building
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  and they arrest those that peacefully went in.
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  This is outrageous. This is a fraud.
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  And bare minimum, the federal government
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  stood down and refused Trump's request
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  for National Guard a month before.
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  And so it's on them because they created the conditions
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  that allow this to happen. Roger Stone.
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:50.000]  Absolutely true. And Alex, those who have been arrested
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  and some of them are guilty of more serious crimes than others,
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  many, they're merely guilty of trespassing.
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  They are allowed due process.
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  They shouldn't be given food laced with feces.
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:05.000]  They shouldn't be allowed to have no access to a law library
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  or a computer if they choose to represent themselves pro se.
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  We are violating the Geneva Conventions.
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:16.000]  We treat terrorists better than we treat these American citizens.
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  We all need to be praying for those who are incarcerated.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:22.000]  I'm for justice for those who did violent things.
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  They should be prosecuted.
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  But so many of these people did nothing violent.
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  They are misguided.
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  The idea of three years,
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  three years in jail for trespassing,
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:35.000]  they keep talking about the deadly attack on the Capitol.
[1:57:35.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  That's right. The only two people killed were unarmed women
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  killed by the Capitol.
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  Thank you so much. God bless. We'll talk to you soon.
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:44.000]  I'm about to host two more hours.
[1:57:44.000 --> 1:57:48.000]  If your stations don't carry it, find it at infowars.com forward slash show.
[1:57:48.000 --> 1:57:50.000]  In my 28 years on air,
[1:57:50.000 --> 1:57:55.000]  reset wars is the most important information I have ever put out.
[1:57:55.000 --> 1:57:58.000]  And since we released it in the middle of December, 2021,
[1:57:58.000 --> 1:58:01.000]  about a month and a half ago, there has been deep banking.
[1:58:01.000 --> 1:58:04.000]  There has been blocking of the video streams.
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:06.000]  There has been attacks on the email servers.
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:10.000]  There has been unprecedented attempts to shut this down.
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:13.000]  And as much of a pain in the neck that is,
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:16.000]  and as much as I don't like it, it lets me know I'm over the target.
[1:58:16.000 --> 1:58:20.000]  The old World War II saying when the bombers knew they were over the German troops
[1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:23.000]  to the German factories, or the Allied factories,
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:25.000]  was because that's where they were getting the flak.
[1:58:25.000 --> 1:58:28.000]  That's where the anti-aircraft guns were shooting at them.
[1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:32.000]  And so my mission is to steer into the flak and take on the globalist,
[1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:34.000]  and they are so afraid of reset wars.
[1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:36.000]  And because of their censorship,
[1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:39.000]  and because of the fact they're scared of this getting the general public,
[1:58:39.000 --> 1:58:41.000]  this mind-spirit technology,
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:58:44.000]  to just be aware of the globalists, now they operate their tricks,
[1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:47.000]  and to be aware of the fact that the universe is much larger
[1:58:47.000 --> 1:58:52.000]  and that God's there literally reaching out to you through free will.
[1:58:52.000 --> 1:58:56.000]  They are doing everything they can to block this information.
[1:58:56.000 --> 1:58:59.000]  So because of all their attempts to censor it and block it,

[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:18.000]  They want you to feel like you're trapped in your five senses.
[1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:20.000]  They don't want you to know about the sixth sense,
[1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:23.000]  or what a lot of the ancients call the third eye.
[1:59:23.000 --> 1:59:25.000]  It's there. It's real.
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:29.000]  And this only gets you to focus with exercises and research
[1:59:29.000 --> 1:59:33.000]  and history and prayer to reconnect with the sixth sense,
[1:59:33.000 --> 1:59:35.000]  which is the conduit to the divine and God.
[1:59:35.000 --> 1:59:38.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, they do not want you to have Reset Wars.
