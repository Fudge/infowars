[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.912]  We're going to tell you what's coming next and what else is going on now.
[00:00:03.232 --> 00:00:08.697]  Not just sit up here and crow like a rooster up on a rooftop about how we've been right about things.
[00:00:08.717 --> 00:00:12.861]  I only mention we've been right about things because this is deadly, deadly serious.
[00:00:13.481 --> 00:00:18.145]  Investigation launched into possible State Department funding of third parties to censor online speech.
[00:00:18.205 --> 00:00:21.789]  That's the Countering Foreign Disinformation Propaganda Act.
[00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:23.710]  $3 billion that I briefed Trump on.
[00:00:24.531 --> 00:00:24.931]  There it is.
[00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:26.652]  It's not speculation.
[00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.413]  It's not a question.
[00:00:28.754 --> 00:00:29.854]  Twitter files two.
[00:00:30.214 --> 00:00:31.735]  Twitter's secret blacklist.
[00:00:32.256 --> 00:00:34.797]  Elon Musk calls out Sussman, Perkins, Coey.
[00:00:35.037 --> 00:00:36.298]  Those are the big Democrat law firms.
[00:00:36.438 --> 00:00:39.520]  Attempt to corrupt a presidential election.
[00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:42.228]  The ADL is one of their main groups.
[00:00:42.248 --> 00:00:43.408]  They use it as an attack dog.
[00:00:43.448 --> 00:00:44.688]  That's in all the documents.
[00:00:44.788 --> 00:00:47.209]  It's all coming up today.
[00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:51.270]  Massive, massive information on that front.
[00:00:51.290 --> 00:01:01.553]  There's also a new major Saudi-Communist-Chinese power axis forming as the globalists destroy American power worldwide while using us to build their world government.
[00:01:01.893 --> 00:01:07.595]  There is just so much we're going to be covering here today on this Live Friday edition.
[00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:19.230]   Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:35.030]   The judge has ruled for guardianship of this four month old baby to be placed into the
[00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.350]   court so that it's heart surgery can proceed as soon as possible.
[00:01:39.395 --> 00:01:42.417]  Four-month-old Will has a rare heart disease.
[00:01:43.178 --> 00:01:53.505]  His parents, Samantha and Cole, lost custody of him because they were not willing to accept blood from vaccinated donors with the spike protein.
[00:01:53.885 --> 00:01:57.948]  They found their own donors, which is allowed, but they were denied.
[00:01:58.408 --> 00:02:06.310]  And they provided evidence that the experimental spike protein stays in the blood of the vaccinated for at least 14 days.
[00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:14.451]  An experimental spike protein which is killing people and causing heart problems primarily with young males.
[00:02:15.111 --> 00:02:16.211]  Just like Will.
[00:02:16.752 --> 00:02:17.772]  But it was ignored.
[00:02:18.492 --> 00:02:23.813]  The New Zealand government locked the three of them under police guard in a hospital room.
[00:02:24.153 --> 00:02:27.775]  They're coming against God and God's will and they're coming against Will.
[00:02:28.275 --> 00:02:29.056]  That's our baby's name.
[00:02:29.116 --> 00:02:32.798]  Our baby's name is Will and he's really important.
[00:02:33.058 --> 00:02:33.718]  It's not over.
[00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:39.662]  Everyone needs to continue to stand and stand with us and fight because this is just the beginning.
[00:02:40.822 --> 00:02:41.363]  It's not over.
[00:02:42.113 --> 00:02:43.615]  And at around 11 p.m.
[00:02:43.655 --> 00:02:48.581]  last night, masked police came into the room and took Will away.
[00:02:48.601 --> 00:03:00.195]  The New Zealand government has now kidnapped this young child and plan to immediately operate on him, specifically using the tainted blood of the vaccinated.
[00:03:00.956 --> 00:03:06.659]  Blood that we know will most likely have the spike protein that has been killing people.
[00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:13.102]  People much older and healthier than four-month-old Will, who needs our help.
[00:03:13.697 --> 00:03:14.658]  You guys are criminals.
[00:03:14.678 --> 00:03:20.023]  You've got to realize that you were never born in a criminal connection.
[00:03:20.063 --> 00:03:22.206]  Did you not see his eyes?
[00:03:24.548 --> 00:03:26.610]  No, you do not need to do the operation.
[00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.213]  No, you do not.
[00:03:29.693 --> 00:03:31.775]  Please, can I just go down with him?
[00:03:33.477 --> 00:03:35.900]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[00:03:36.991 --> 00:03:41.133]  We'll have his pre-op checks before a surgery that's scheduled and can't be changed.
[00:03:41.153 --> 00:03:42.153]  Well, it can be changed.
[00:03:43.134 --> 00:03:50.998]  I think what the baby needs is as much rest as possible, so that he can... Excuse me, what are you doing?
[00:03:51.118 --> 00:03:51.978]  Don't do that, boys.
[00:03:52.078 --> 00:03:53.259]  Hey, don't do it.
[00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:55.620]  Please don't do it!
[00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.680]  Hey!
[00:03:57.001 --> 00:03:58.801]  We're talking about the surgery.
[00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:00.402]  You guys are criminals!
[00:04:00.682 --> 00:04:01.603]  You are criminals!
[00:04:01.643 --> 00:04:03.584]  You are conducting a criminal act here!
[00:04:04.404 --> 00:04:05.445]  So what's the pre-op check?
[00:04:06.286 --> 00:04:08.008]  It needs to happen before the surgery.
[00:04:08.228 --> 00:04:08.509]  Hey!
[00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.633]  We've been talking to you like rational people and now you just remove... You've done it.
[00:04:13.891 --> 00:04:15.052]  You are criminals.
[00:04:15.112 --> 00:04:16.112]  Oh my God!
[00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:19.835]  How can you do this?
[00:04:19.855 --> 00:04:21.095]  Get out of my way!
[00:04:21.155 --> 00:04:23.617]  Get out of my way!
[00:04:23.697 --> 00:04:24.998]  Guys, move out!
[00:04:25.538 --> 00:04:26.438]  Move out the way!
[00:04:26.458 --> 00:04:29.660]  You guys are acting like criminals!
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.022]  You are acting like criminals!
[00:04:32.342 --> 00:04:36.444]  All of you are criminals!
[00:04:37.125 --> 00:04:38.385]  You are criminals!
[00:04:38.586 --> 00:04:39.486]  You are a criminal!
[00:04:41.187 --> 00:04:41.787]  And so are you!
[00:04:41.908 --> 00:04:42.448]  And so are you!
[00:04:42.728 --> 00:04:45.650]  Can you guys just give them some space please?
[00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:46.850]  You are a criminal!
[00:04:47.611 --> 00:04:50.132]  You will not be part of the surgery tomorrow.
[00:04:50.152 --> 00:04:52.653]  We do not authorise any of that.
[00:04:52.673 --> 00:04:55.015]  I just want to tell you what's happening.
[00:04:55.055 --> 00:04:57.336]  No, we're not listening to what you've got to say.
[00:04:57.936 --> 00:04:59.157]  Why did you do that?
[00:05:00.058 --> 00:05:01.099]  He's going to be okay.
[00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.141]  No, he is not going to be okay.
[00:05:03.342 --> 00:05:07.826]  We need to take him home.
[00:05:07.906 --> 00:05:11.290]  We need to take him and we need to do... You are criminals!
[00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:14.513]  You will be able to see him after the surgery.
[00:05:14.533 --> 00:05:16.215]  You guys are criminals.
[00:05:16.415 --> 00:05:17.516]  You are going to be recorded.
[00:05:18.777 --> 00:05:23.281]  The animals of time as criminals who come in here and take babies from their mothers.
[00:05:23.401 --> 00:05:25.342]  Do you understand that?
[00:05:25.743 --> 00:05:27.884]  Do you guys are even listening to me?
[00:05:27.924 --> 00:05:33.789]  Do you understand that you have just kidnapped a baby from its mother without the consent of their parents?
[00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:36.111]  You guys have got to understand that you're criminals.
[00:05:36.891 --> 00:05:41.891]  I understand, but you can't just take my baby like that!
[00:05:41.891 --> 00:05:43.891]  You guys are criminals.
[00:05:43.891 --> 00:05:44.891]  Please!
[00:05:44.891 --> 00:05:46.891]  I need to be with him!
[00:05:46.891 --> 00:05:48.891]  Did you not see his eyes?
[00:05:48.891 --> 00:05:50.891]  Did you not see his eyes?
[00:05:50.891 --> 00:05:52.891]  Did you not see his eyes?
[00:05:52.891 --> 00:05:55.891]  No, you do not need to do the operation.
[00:05:55.891 --> 00:05:56.891]  Please!
[00:05:56.891 --> 00:05:58.891]  Alright folks, it's Friday, December 9th, 2020.
[00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:01.052]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:06:01.072 --> 00:06:05.016]  We're gonna be here for the next four hours ahead of the great Owen Schroer at 3 p.m.
[00:06:05.036 --> 00:06:09.840]  Central with The War Room right here on the vaunted InfoWars radio slash TV network.
[00:06:10.934 --> 00:06:12.939]  Okay, let me just hit what's coming up.
[00:06:15.205 --> 00:06:18.072]  Putin says Russia may add nuclear first strike to strategy.
[00:06:19.707 --> 00:06:23.210]  Putin says any country that attacks Russia with nukes will be wiped off the face of the earth.
[00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.432]  He says nuclear war is much closer than ever.
[00:06:25.452 --> 00:06:29.996]  New Zealand government kidnaps baby with bad heart to prove mRNA blood won't hurt him.
[00:06:30.357 --> 00:06:31.698]  We have the video of that actually happening.
[00:06:31.718 --> 00:06:34.280]  We had the family on with updates in the last two days.
[00:06:35.201 --> 00:06:37.723]  Looks like they forced surgery on him sometime today.
[00:06:37.743 --> 00:06:42.487]  But remember, they're a day ahead of us, so the family may be popping in here on the broadcast.
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.082]  We have a ton of other giant COVID news and it's just off the top.
[00:06:47.222 --> 00:06:48.703]  I mean, just over the top.
[00:06:48.743 --> 00:06:50.224]  It is just totally insane.
[00:06:50.364 --> 00:06:54.747]  By the day, it gets more bizarre, more incredible, a giant stack there.
[00:06:55.648 --> 00:07:10.358]  We also have a huge stack of news dealing with the investigation at Twitter and how the government was literally with private corporations and think tanks running Twitter to steal the election and censor the American people.
[00:07:10.658 --> 00:07:13.460]  Now, I know as listeners, you've all known that for a long time.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.241]  We were the first to break it.
[00:07:15.261 --> 00:07:20.203]  And even Tucker Carlson, thanks to him, gave us credit for breaking it first Wednesday night.
[00:07:20.763 --> 00:07:22.064]  But that's a side issue.
[00:07:22.584 --> 00:07:25.485]  We're going to tell you what's coming next and what else is going on now.
[00:07:25.805 --> 00:07:31.288]  Not just sit up here and crow like a rooster up on a rooftop about how we've been right about things.
[00:07:31.308 --> 00:07:35.390]  I only mention we've been right about things because this is deadly, deadly serious.
[00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:40.694]  Investigation launched into possible State Department funding of third parties to censor online speech.
[00:07:40.754 --> 00:07:44.337]  That's the Countering Foreign Disinformation Propaganda Act.
[00:07:44.357 --> 00:07:46.319]  $3 billion that I briefed Trump on.
[00:07:47.119 --> 00:07:47.660]  There it is.
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.221]  It's not speculation.
[00:07:49.721 --> 00:07:50.982]  It's not a question.
[00:07:51.343 --> 00:07:51.983]  Twitter Files 2.
[00:07:52.143 --> 00:07:54.325]  Twitter's secret blacklist.
[00:07:54.846 --> 00:07:57.388]  Elon Musk calls out Sussman, Perkins, Coey.
[00:07:57.648 --> 00:07:58.889]  Those are the big Democrat law firms.
[00:07:59.029 --> 00:08:02.112]  Attempt to corrupt a presidential election.
[00:08:03.084 --> 00:08:04.805]  The ADL is one of their main groups.
[00:08:04.845 --> 00:08:05.986]  They use us as an attack dog.
[00:08:06.026 --> 00:08:07.267]  That's in all the documents.
[00:08:07.347 --> 00:08:09.788]  It's all coming up today.
[00:08:10.108 --> 00:08:13.851]  Massive, massive information on that front.
[00:08:13.871 --> 00:08:24.137]  There's also a new major Saudi-Communist-Chinese power axis forming as the globalists destroy American power worldwide while using us to build their world government.
[00:08:24.477 --> 00:08:30.197]   There is just so much We're going to be covering here today on this Live Friday edition.
[00:08:31.038 --> 00:08:41.242]  Then Gavin McGinnis is going to join us to cover the waterfront of American culture, the fallout of the Ye interview, censorship, the Twitter files, and more in the second hour.
[00:08:41.282 --> 00:08:48.325]  And we'll take calls right through the third into the fourth hour with some Jadar as well in the fourth hour.
[00:08:48.425 --> 00:08:50.065]  Always incredibly informative.
[00:08:50.105 --> 00:08:51.326]  That is just some.
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.680]  of the news and information.
[00:08:53.861 --> 00:08:57.222]  Also, the whole trans agenda is about sterilizing children.
[00:08:57.262 --> 00:09:00.043]  If you can't kill them in the womb, you want to sterilize them after.
[00:09:00.063 --> 00:09:01.104]  That's on record.
[00:09:01.164 --> 00:09:02.704]  Tavistock Institute, British Intelligence.
[00:09:03.144 --> 00:09:04.545]  The plan was hatched in the 1960s.
[00:09:04.925 --> 00:09:08.006]  I put it in my film Terror Storm that came out 18 years ago.
[00:09:08.186 --> 00:09:09.087]  That's how long we've been on this.
[00:09:09.787 --> 00:09:12.649]  But now they're pushing the trans-abled movement.
[00:09:13.049 --> 00:09:17.352]  They're going to teach children to gouge their eyeballs off and cut their arms and legs off.
[00:09:17.832 --> 00:09:22.996]  And mainline psychological associations are coming out saying, well, this is probably a good thing.
[00:09:23.736 --> 00:09:25.538]  Let's cut people's arms and legs off.
[00:09:25.818 --> 00:09:31.862]  If they want to have their arms and legs cut off and their eyeballs gouged out or Drano poured in their eyes, then we should do it to them.
[00:09:32.262 --> 00:09:40.594]  And there are actual psychologists and psychiatrists now dumping Drano in women's eyes, chopping arms and legs off all over the world, including here in the United States.
[00:09:40.614 --> 00:09:41.495]  This is not a joke.
[00:09:41.876 --> 00:09:42.857]  We're not making this up.
[00:09:43.238 --> 00:09:45.080]  We're going to show you examples of that coming up.
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.122]  It's been going on for a long time.
[00:09:47.321 --> 00:09:50.723]  But now it is a big, big, big thing.
[00:09:51.544 --> 00:09:55.327]  I remember like 16, 17, 18 years ago, there was a documentary I saw at South by Southwest.
[00:09:56.287 --> 00:09:57.628]  South by Southwest was still cool.
[00:09:57.668 --> 00:10:06.755]  It actually had a lot of original grassroots content in it about these transabled people, particularly homosexual men who like to have their arms and legs chopped off.
[00:10:06.775 --> 00:10:09.417]  And then they live in a box and they're called a nugget.
[00:10:10.037 --> 00:10:12.639]  Now, that was illegal in the United States to do that.
[00:10:13.019 --> 00:10:15.361]  So Mexico was the nugget capital of the world.
[00:10:15.421 --> 00:10:16.462]  And this is not a joke, folks.
[00:10:16.982 --> 00:10:18.423]  There's actual things called nugget porn.
[00:10:18.443 --> 00:10:20.305]  I've never seen it, but it's been in news reports.
[00:10:20.705 --> 00:10:21.986]  I've talked to people that have seen it.
[00:10:22.567 --> 00:10:24.668]  And this is people that have their arms and legs cut off.
[00:10:24.988 --> 00:10:26.610]  First you have a hand cut off, then an arm.
[00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:27.430]  That's not cool enough.
[00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:29.332]  Then both arms, both legs.
[00:10:29.732 --> 00:10:30.553]  Up to the stumps.
[00:10:30.973 --> 00:10:32.754]  Up to your buttocks.
[00:10:33.195 --> 00:10:35.917]  And then you live in a box as a sex slave.
[00:10:36.437 --> 00:10:39.960]  So it's beyond the movie Pulp Fiction where he goes, bring out the gimp.
[00:10:40.581 --> 00:10:41.862]  He goes, the gimp's sleeping.
[00:10:42.242 --> 00:10:44.344]  He goes, well, you need to wake him up now, don't you?
[00:10:44.984 --> 00:10:52.951]  This is the world of these sickos where people have Stockholm Syndrome and are totally mentally ill and opt in to slavery.
[00:10:53.250 --> 00:11:00.290]   opt into tyranny, opt into this total mind control, and it all goes back to the government-forced,
[00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:05.331]   pushed euthanasia that's just flat-out genocide and murder being prepared everywhere. Remember,
[00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:09.169]   communist China, the mass death, the camps being built in the name of COVID,
[00:11:09.169 --> 00:11:13.890]   whole cities locked down, doors welded shut. All of this is the model of the world,
[00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:18.050]   and Australia has gone almost as far as so has New Zealand as China,
[00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:21.010]   till people rebelled, then they backed off for now, but they're coming back.
[00:11:21.186 --> 00:11:33.797]  We're going to play this special report Darren McBreen put together that just went live in the Darren McBreen section of Bandot Video, documenting how our world tomorrow will be China unless we say no and hopefully free China.
[00:11:34.017 --> 00:11:34.598]  Here's the report.
[00:11:34.618 --> 00:11:35.178]  We'll be right back.
[00:11:35.198 --> 00:11:35.559]  Stay with us.
[00:11:37.455 --> 00:11:39.017]  This is the end of a free society.
[00:11:39.317 --> 00:11:40.779]  It's the total New World Order plan.
[00:11:40.839 --> 00:11:42.000]  It's Operation Lockstep.
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:42.981]  This is everything.
[00:11:43.001 --> 00:11:48.326]  That's why I keep hammering the shots, hammering the lockdowns, hammering the persecution, because they just think we're going to go to sleep for a while.
[00:11:48.627 --> 00:11:53.232]  We'll give them some type of political, cultural amnesty, and then we all just quietly go away.
[00:11:53.252 --> 00:11:54.072]  I mean, look at this footage.
[00:11:54.793 --> 00:11:57.377]  If you've ever seen a Pied Piper in the real world, that's it.
[00:11:57.658 --> 00:12:09.757]  One white-clad Judas goat in a paramilitary medical tyranny outfit leading thousands and thousands and thousands of Chinese who all got told they were red-coated with no evidence and had to go to the camps.
[00:12:10.237 --> 00:12:12.938]  It's perhaps the biggest quarantine in human history.
[00:12:12.998 --> 00:12:16.219]  Millions of people worldwide have been quarantined.
[00:12:16.399 --> 00:12:19.941]  Millions of people in China are once again under collective quarantine.
[00:12:20.341 --> 00:12:25.423]  In the industrial city of Chanshou, 6.6 million residents have been ordered to stay indoors.
[00:12:25.663 --> 00:12:29.645]  Workers in protective suits have installed metal barriers in some neighborhoods.
[00:12:29.985 --> 00:12:34.687]  China is reportedly putting suspected COVID-19 patients in metal boxes.
[00:12:34.867 --> 00:12:37.688]  Well, they're erecting sometimes shipping containers.
[00:12:37.888 --> 00:12:39.489]  We've seen a couple of tents as well.
[00:12:39.729 --> 00:12:46.032]  More than 200 million people in China are in lockdown and are banned from leaving their home, even to buy food.
[00:12:47.132 --> 00:12:54.715]  Long winding lines of buses can be seen in a street which are taking people to COVID-19 quarantine camps.
[00:12:54.735 --> 00:12:57.797]  25 million residents ordered confined to their homes.
[00:12:58.177 --> 00:13:00.878]  They're using bicycle locks and padlocks just to keep people in.
[00:13:01.258 --> 00:13:08.241]  This video on your screen shows officials dragging a man into a quarantine center where the conditions are appalling to say the least.
[00:13:08.581 --> 00:13:12.643]  These people locked up in quarantine camps being treated worse than prisoners.
[00:13:13.326 --> 00:13:19.211]  Now we need to go and look in families to find those people who may be sick and remove them.
[00:13:19.691 --> 00:13:25.075]  The judge has ruled for guardianship of this four-month-old baby to be placed into the court.
[00:13:25.195 --> 00:13:31.000]  He needs life-saving surgery, but his parents don't want him to receive blood from those who have been vaccinated.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.982]  So, this is all about the state.
[00:13:33.002 --> 00:13:34.523]  It's the same worldwide you indirected.
[00:13:34.563 --> 00:13:42.709]   Taking control of your bodies, And now saying we're gonna put blood product to people that have a growing prion or spike protein in your body.
[00:13:42.729 --> 00:13:49.914]  We have all the medical reports, the governor of Florida has criminal investigations going, a big pharma lying about this, but they're still doubling down.
[00:13:50.154 --> 00:13:55.138]  We don't want blood that potentially could have spike protein.
[00:13:55.178 --> 00:13:55.818]  We don't want that.
[00:13:55.878 --> 00:13:58.780]  We know that that is, you know, he's got a compromised heart.
[00:13:59.261 --> 00:14:06.180]   What's happening here is just the beginning of An authoritarian takeover, and it's coming for all of us.
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.820]  This type of tyranny is coming to New Zealand.
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.140]  It is coming to Australia.
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.401]  It is coming to America.
[00:14:11.541 --> 00:14:13.181]  It is coming to the entire world.
[00:14:13.241 --> 00:14:17.942]  Chinese-style COVID lockdown tyranny is on its way.
[00:14:17.962 --> 00:14:23.183]  For people who are not vaccinated, lockdown rules will apply to everyone 16 and above.
[00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:30.864]  It's absolutely mind-boggling that you could hold healthy, law-abiding, fully vaccinated citizens in these kind of conditions.
[00:14:31.124 --> 00:14:36.806]  We have now a window of opportunity to create this global reset which we all need.
[00:14:37.086 --> 00:14:44.508]  They will continue to try to restrict and limit and vaccinate and do all of the other things that we're seeing done in China.
[00:14:44.628 --> 00:14:45.789]  It's just a matter of time.
[00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:55.532]  And as their algorithms get more sophisticated, the World Economic Forum and Klaus Schwab are not just going to sit back and allow humanity the freedom that we so clearly desire.
[00:14:56.092 --> 00:15:02.816]   I respect China's Achievements which are tremendous.
[00:15:03.517 --> 00:15:07.281]  I think it's a role model for many countries.
[00:15:07.822 --> 00:15:09.223]  This is the social credit score.
[00:15:09.464 --> 00:15:12.087]  This is breaking you down, locking you up, training you to be a slave.
[00:15:12.107 --> 00:15:15.591]  They'll only let you out again later as long as you follow all the orders they say.
[00:15:15.951 --> 00:15:17.853]  They get progressively more tyrannical.
[00:15:18.073 --> 00:15:18.834]  Where'd Bob go?
[00:15:18.894 --> 00:15:19.335]  I don't know.
[00:15:19.695 --> 00:15:21.037]  Went to a coven camp, never came back.
[00:15:21.437 --> 00:15:25.159]  They're just training you to get used to seeing people grabbed and rounded up all around you.
[00:15:25.539 --> 00:15:32.061]  Super hardcore tyranny, the model of the Great Reset and the New World Order, and we're gonna be here fighting it big time.
[00:15:36.203 --> 00:15:39.804]  And we are back on this Friday, December 9th, 2022 broadcast.
[00:15:40.685 --> 00:15:41.465]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:15:43.686 --> 00:15:52.130]   Hundreds of publications a day scream and yell and howl Why is Alex Jones still on air?
[00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:53.011]  Take him off.
[00:15:53.131 --> 00:15:53.972]  Shut him up.
[00:15:54.653 --> 00:15:58.456]  He's exposing our global, corporate, anti-human, transhumanist revolution.
[00:15:59.097 --> 00:16:03.901]  And if the common people figure it out, it's game over for us that we're waging war against them.
[00:16:04.482 --> 00:16:08.906]  Economic, cultural, biological, chemical, radiological, electromagnetic.
[00:16:10.407 --> 00:16:13.991]  If they figure that out, it's game over for us.
[00:16:16.181 --> 00:16:20.863]  Out of all this incredibly important information, let's drill in the latest COVID poison news.
[00:16:21.263 --> 00:16:26.346]  New Zealand government kidnaps baby with bad heart to prove mRNA blood won't hurt him.
[00:16:26.366 --> 00:16:40.653]  The videos on InfoWars.com of them coming in armed police and grabbing the baby away to take it away and give it the forced blood from people contaminated with the spike protein.
[00:16:43.737 --> 00:16:44.597]  That's in New Zealand.
[00:16:45.137 --> 00:16:51.439]  Duke University surgeons are refusing a 14-year-old girl a kidney transplant because she's not received the COVID shot.
[00:16:53.599 --> 00:16:54.399]  Total abuse.
[00:16:54.459 --> 00:16:57.760]  You don't want an experimental shot that everybody thinks is deadly and the evidence shows?
[00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:02.761]  Well, we're just going to deny you medical treatment, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:05.041 --> 00:17:07.322]  And there's the poor young little girl.
[00:17:10.461 --> 00:17:12.542]  What true monsters violate the Hippocratic Oath?
[00:17:13.142 --> 00:17:13.742]  Oh, but U.S.
[00:17:13.782 --> 00:17:18.004]  hospitals overwhelmed by COVID, RSV and the flu, and it's the vaccinated that are sick.
[00:17:18.024 --> 00:17:20.465]  We've got studies already showing it.
[00:17:22.586 --> 00:17:29.089]  Strep A kills more children than COVID did in its first year, as deaths are blamed on lockdown immunity debt.
[00:17:32.651 --> 00:17:33.112]  Absolutely.
[00:17:33.312 --> 00:17:39.503]  All the experts said it would cause regular viruses to wreak havoc, but also destroy the immune system of those that have taken the shot.
[00:17:39.883 --> 00:17:44.131]  And now there's more studies out that the so-called vaccinated are sloughing.
[00:17:45.270 --> 00:18:06.514]  The spike proteins, just like they told you, you could just touch a cow that had really bad spongiform encephalopathy, or the prion crystals growing in their blood and tissues and organs and brain, and then if you touch it to your mouth or to your eye, you could get it just from that and it could start replicating, and it might take six months or a year for it to double, double, double, but finally it would kill you!
[00:18:06.534 --> 00:18:12.515]  And it's the exact same type compound.
[00:18:13.812 --> 00:18:14.553]  Unbelievable.
[00:18:14.753 --> 00:18:20.396]  Dr. Peter McCullough, messenger RNA is transferring from vaccinated to unvaccinated.
[00:18:23.078 --> 00:18:24.199]  And he's done a great job.
[00:18:24.279 --> 00:18:27.141]  Coming up next segment, I'll play several clips of McCullough when we come out of break.
[00:18:28.226 --> 00:18:29.066]  We now know the U.S.
[00:18:29.086 --> 00:18:33.269]  government created COVID-19 by funding gain-of-function research in Wuhan lab in China, but the U.S.
[00:18:33.289 --> 00:18:38.492]  government also created gene-encoded vaccines to mirror the deadly weapons they were making.
[00:18:38.692 --> 00:18:46.176]  And that's been in the emails for two years because of the doctor whistleblower we had on Tuesday.
[00:18:48.735 --> 00:18:53.877]  Who is going to be back with us tomorrow in a commercial-free Saturday emergency broadcast little post.
[00:18:53.897 --> 00:18:56.178]  We're going to tape it at 4 p.m.
[00:18:56.518 --> 00:18:56.958]  Central.
[00:18:57.659 --> 00:19:12.025]  He was the head scientist at Wuhan, the head scientist at Dr. Peter Daszak's company that was working at Wuhan, and he witnessed all this and saw it all unfold.
[00:19:13.123 --> 00:19:16.006]  No wonder they've harassed him so badly.
[00:19:16.046 --> 00:19:30.178]  No wonder there's been so much incredible levels of censorship going on of thousands and thousands of prominent doctors and scientists and prestigious individuals and hundreds of thousands of doctors and nurses that have told what they witnessed.
[00:19:30.658 --> 00:19:36.803]  Stanford's Dr. Bhattacharya, I want to know if the government officials told Twitter to blacklist me.
[00:19:37.144 --> 00:19:38.865]  They have directed censorship before.
[00:19:39.265 --> 00:19:39.826]  Of course they did.
[00:19:41.405 --> 00:19:49.848]  In Alberta, 56% of the deaths were wrongly counted as unvaxxed because they occurred in the first 14 days of vaccination.
[00:19:50.308 --> 00:19:51.389]  This makes no sense.
[00:19:51.449 --> 00:19:54.050]  Here's the real data below, unless they were covering it up.
[00:19:54.350 --> 00:20:16.266]   And whether it was New Zealand, or whether it was Canada, or whether it was Germany, or whether it was the US, or whether it was the UK, or whether it was the Netherlands, everywhere it was directed the same to hide that most of the deaths Is in the first 14 days, so they don't call it death of vaccinated, because they don't count you as vaccinated for 14 days, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:18.246 --> 00:20:19.186]  That's how this works.
[00:20:20.407 --> 00:20:21.547]  That's how this operates.
[00:20:23.128 --> 00:20:31.431]  We have a lot of other ultra massive COVID news we're going to be going over today, but this one is really big.
[00:20:31.811 --> 00:20:32.851]  This one's really important.
[00:20:32.891 --> 00:20:34.872]  CNN spends it like it's a crisis.
[00:20:36.101 --> 00:20:37.202]  It's a crisis for the globalists.
[00:20:37.502 --> 00:20:37.782]  U.S.
[00:20:37.822 --> 00:20:46.927]  military braces for impact of COVID vaccine mandate repeal because the Republicans have control of the House and they say they're going to repeal it in the Defense Authorization Act.
[00:20:47.507 --> 00:20:49.668]  You're not allowed to even give the military experimental shots.
[00:20:49.948 --> 00:20:53.290]  That's been found by the Supreme Court and other federal courts.
[00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:54.450]  Remember the anthrax shot?
[00:20:54.871 --> 00:20:58.312]  Two separate times they found it unconstitutional, but they still did it illegally.
[00:20:58.773 --> 00:21:01.254]  All of it, Joseph Mingalesque.
[00:21:01.814 --> 00:21:03.215]  All of it, like grabbing that baby.
[00:21:06.226 --> 00:21:12.832]  And saying we're going to give it a blood transfusion, obtained COVID spike protein filled blood.
[00:21:14.854 --> 00:21:16.115]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:21:16.675 --> 00:21:20.759]  But the good news is humanity's fighting back, but they want control.
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:27.225]  They want ownership over our bodies and they want control and they want ownership now.
[00:21:30.359 --> 00:21:32.861]  And this is the final frontier of their control.
[00:21:33.182 --> 00:21:41.789]  They're already bathing us in the 5G, bathing us in all the GMO food, bathing us in all the GMO vaccines, and now the frankenshots.
[00:21:43.051 --> 00:21:49.356]  It would make Joseph Mingala blush in a big, big way.
[00:21:51.318 --> 00:21:59.288]   Absolutely insane, ladies and gentlemen, that we have reached this point In our civilization that they actually cooked up the virus.
[00:21:59.308 --> 00:22:01.670]  They actually released it to create total fear.
[00:22:03.257 --> 00:22:31.326]   They actually then push a shot that is much more dangerous than the actual pathogen to produce the prions in the body and they're actually currently getting away with it when it's in every insurance actuary and government actuarial society from the US to Europe to Australia that there is an 11 to 18 percent increase in death, unprecedented in modern Statistical history since they've been getting statistics the last 150 years.
[00:22:31.406 --> 00:22:33.767]  It is a giant die-off.
[00:22:34.207 --> 00:22:37.509]  I could, I could say here, let's forget all the guests today.
[00:22:37.529 --> 00:22:39.950]  I'm not doing that, but you know, let's not have Gavin McGinnis on.
[00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:43.191]  Let's just sweep all the guests off today, and let's just open the phones up.
[00:22:44.132 --> 00:22:46.493]  Did you have a good experience with these shots or a bad experience?
[00:22:47.526 --> 00:22:56.911]  And we can take 100 phone calls and nobody, I've done this 10-15 times, nobody, you've heard it, nobody will call in and say this was great.
[00:22:57.291 --> 00:22:58.992]  Nobody will call in and say it was wonderful.
[00:22:59.532 --> 00:23:04.575]  They'll tell you about how they got sick, or their family member died, or how they work at a nursing home, they see all of a sudden they got 100 patients.
[00:23:06.896 --> 00:23:10.560]  100 wards and 15 of them die within a month of taking the damn shot?
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.662]  And usually only two or three of the people in the home die a year?
[00:23:14.023 --> 00:23:14.964]  You know, stuff like that.
[00:23:15.424 --> 00:23:24.272]  And the coroners and the pathologists and the funeral homes and the undertakers all say it's the biggest increase in death and the cemeteries will tell you that.
[00:23:24.452 --> 00:23:29.276]  Hell, we've all seen the articles, you've all seen the statistics, there's no doubt about any of this!
[00:23:30.357 --> 00:23:41.178]   And we sit here and watch all this go on While the ADL runs around and tells us the biggest threat is white supremacists and Nazis, when this is stuff that would make Hitler blush.
[00:23:43.378 --> 00:23:44.818]  Absolutely insane.
[00:23:45.419 --> 00:23:47.139]  Totally and completely out of control.
[00:23:47.159 --> 00:23:51.780]  I'm going to play some Dr. Peter McCullough clips that are extremely powerful back-to-back.
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:55.201]  And some of Senator Ron Johnson's ongoing hearings as well.
[00:23:55.421 --> 00:23:56.801]  When we come back, stay with us.
[00:23:57.642 --> 00:23:58.582]  We've got a big guest coming up.
[00:23:59.562 --> 00:24:07.750]  In 2012, DARPA, which is the research division of the military, started a program.
[00:24:08.271 --> 00:24:11.054]  It's called the AdeptProtect P3 program.
[00:24:11.534 --> 00:24:13.796]  Pandemic Prevention Platform.
[00:24:14.917 --> 00:24:15.999]  Look what they proposed!
[00:24:17.264 --> 00:24:26.950]  They said, listen, we are going to use gene encoded vaccines as a new category of preventive measures based on RNA or DNA.
[00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:31.393]  And in this approach, we will stop a pandemic within 60 days.
[00:24:32.333 --> 00:24:35.895]  Within 60 days, in 2012, this was started.
[00:24:38.497 --> 00:24:43.480]  When President Trump came out and said it's Operation Warp Speed and they're going to develop vaccines.
[00:24:45.498 --> 00:24:53.362]  It would have been nice if he was prepped or Anthony Fauci was prepped to say, listen, we're working on this.
[00:24:53.543 --> 00:24:55.163]  We've been working on this since 2012.
[00:24:56.764 --> 00:24:57.725]  This is not new.
[00:24:57.945 --> 00:24:59.106]  This isn't warp speed.
[00:24:59.466 --> 00:25:01.187]  This is 10 years in coming.
[00:25:03.134 --> 00:25:09.620]  The deception out in the open that this was rapidly developed, that there was all this stunning innovation.
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:14.684]  The contractors, Moderna got its first multi-million dollar contract in 2013.
[00:25:14.744 --> 00:25:25.193]  The military works on programs, both the threat, SARS-CoV-2, and work on the answer, monoclonal antibodies and vaccines.
[00:25:26.385 --> 00:25:28.686]  But the military has biological threat programs.
[00:25:28.706 --> 00:25:34.947]  There's one for smallpox, monkeypox, there's one for anthrax, and who knows how many more programs.
[00:25:35.007 --> 00:25:36.668]  This was part of a program.
[00:25:37.088 --> 00:25:41.209]  But the military came up with the idea of messenger RNA vaccines.
[00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:42.550]  Not Pfizer or Moderna.
[00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:44.450]  Not Operation Warp Speed.
[00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:49.251]  It wasn't in response to what was, you know, came out of Wuhan, China.
[00:25:49.271 --> 00:25:50.672]  This is a military.
[00:25:51.412 --> 00:26:00.922]  When it was announced by Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, and the Department of Defense, that's who ushered us into the vaccine era.
[00:26:01.863 --> 00:26:02.784]  The military.
[00:26:03.745 --> 00:26:09.731]  Emergency use authorization is a mechanism to get rapid new technology into the military.
[00:26:10.211 --> 00:26:12.734]  It's not a mechanism for the public.
[00:26:14.102 --> 00:26:17.503]  It's first application broadly to the public was with the COVID-19 pandemic.
[00:26:17.523 --> 00:26:25.866]  That's the reason why it has to be said to the pathway to prevent any more harm is all the vaccines need to be pulled off the market and withdrawn.
[00:26:26.466 --> 00:26:27.927]  That needs to happen immediately.
[00:26:28.407 --> 00:26:31.468]  All the vaccine mandates should be dropped immediately.
[00:26:31.488 --> 00:26:36.350]  We need requests for applications and immediate funding for vaccine injury.
[00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:43.434]  We need a massive shift in our healthcare system towards managing now this large number of vaccine injured people.
[00:26:43.313 --> 00:26:51.112]   and management, we need a massive shift in our healthcare system towards managing now
[00:26:51.112 --> 00:26:55.273]  this large number of vaccine injured people.
[00:26:55.273 --> 00:27:02.113]   What's at stake here is death and the deaths that were reported by Mr. Dowd and others,
[00:27:02.113 --> 00:27:06.992]   the deaths on a more probable than not basis that are occurring in someone who has taken
[00:27:06.992 --> 00:27:09.192]  a vaccine are due to the vaccine.
[00:27:09.271 --> 00:27:11.032]  And the autopsy studies show it.
[00:27:11.052 --> 00:27:12.173]  It's alarming.
[00:27:12.233 --> 00:27:16.216]  To save American lives now, these vaccines need to be pulled off the market.
[00:27:16.276 --> 00:27:17.237]  That's what should be done.
[00:27:18.294 --> 00:27:20.877]  So a few months ago I looked at the package insert.
[00:27:20.937 --> 00:27:23.259]  I pulled it from the box of mRNA product.
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:27.183]  And you know it was sealed just like I'm showing you here.
[00:27:27.203 --> 00:27:30.446]  I unsealed the box that the entire thing came in.
[00:27:30.506 --> 00:27:31.627]  And then I pulled this out.
[00:27:31.987 --> 00:27:33.048]  And this is what it looks like.
[00:27:33.629 --> 00:27:37.272]  So I'd like to show this to you.
[00:27:37.313 --> 00:27:37.893]  Sorry about that.
[00:27:40.382 --> 00:27:40.942]  It's blank.
[00:27:41.522 --> 00:27:42.303]  Boom.
[00:27:43.023 --> 00:27:43.603]  There it is.
[00:27:43.623 --> 00:27:46.124]  It says intentionally blank on it.
[00:27:46.705 --> 00:27:55.228]  That's the data that pharmacists and physicians are basing on giving the injections outside of mainstream media recommendations.
[00:27:55.448 --> 00:27:56.468]  There it is right there.
[00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:57.969]  Here's a good question.
[00:27:58.669 --> 00:28:01.930]  Why didn't they just print that on a piece of paper the size of a postage stamp?
[00:28:02.991 --> 00:28:07.573]  Why all the theater of folding it up into a great big piece of paper like that?
[00:28:07.693 --> 00:28:07.853]  Why?
[00:28:10.186 --> 00:28:13.711]  That's what's passing for informed consent.
[00:28:14.051 --> 00:28:19.198]  Right, so how am I to get informed consent to parents when I have, this is what I have.
[00:28:19.759 --> 00:28:26.247]  I have a government that's telling me that I have to stay safe and effective, and if I don't, my license is a threat.
[00:28:27.588 --> 00:28:29.790]  How am I to give informed consent to patients?
[00:28:30.451 --> 00:28:32.432]  We're seeing an uptick in myocarditis.
[00:28:32.513 --> 00:28:34.714]  We're seeing an uptick in adverse reactions.
[00:28:35.135 --> 00:28:39.678]  We have trusted these regulatory agencies, I have, for my entire career.
[00:28:40.509 --> 00:28:43.510]  Up until now, something is extremely wrong.
[00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:50.671]  In my hospital, I was banned or discouraged from using off-label drugs which we use every day.
[00:28:50.771 --> 00:29:00.454]  Methylprednisolone, vitamin C. My hospital would not allow me to use vitamin C. We're talking about basic safe drugs.
[00:29:01.234 --> 00:29:02.614]  And it's an outrage.
[00:29:02.794 --> 00:29:05.675]  What they wanted me to use was remdesivir.
[00:29:06.995 --> 00:29:16.504]  Where Remdesivir, we know, and this is not controversial, we know according to the WHO, Remdesivir increases your risk of kidney failure 20-fold.
[00:29:18.368 --> 00:29:22.571]  Remdesivir will increase your risk of developing renal failure 20-fold.
[00:29:23.031 --> 00:29:26.974]  It increases your risk of dying by about 4%.
[00:29:27.594 --> 00:29:40.683]  It has no place in medicine, yet the federal government will give hospitals a 20% bonus on the entire hospital bill if you prescribe this toxic medication.
[00:29:41.283 --> 00:29:47.948]   So you can see how the hospitals and the healthcare systems are now subservient My story is pretty simple.
[00:29:48.008 --> 00:29:48.668]  Our story is pretty simple.
[00:29:48.728 --> 00:29:49.989]  Josh has done some work as well.
[00:29:50.029 --> 00:29:53.231]  The bottom line is we saw 2020 pre-vaccine and 2021 and 2022 post-vaccine.
[00:29:53.271 --> 00:29:57.294]  There was a mixed shift from 2020 to 2021 of excess mortality from old to young.
[00:29:57.114 --> 00:29:59.114]  Can I get the next slide, please?
[00:29:59.114 --> 00:30:07.114]   The bottom line is we saw 2020 pre-vaccine and 2021 and 2022 post-vaccine.
[00:30:07.114 --> 00:30:14.114]   There was a mixed shift from 2020 to 2021 of excess mortality from old to young.
[00:30:14.114 --> 00:30:16.114]  So in 2020, it was mostly old people.
[00:30:16.114 --> 00:30:24.114]   We also saw a mixed shift in disabilities starting to rise in May of '21.
[00:30:24.228 --> 00:30:31.690]  The excess mortality has shifted so much so that it's pretty phenomenal what you see here in the charts before you.
[00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:35.890]  This is not my data, this is the Society of Actuaries.
[00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:45.592]  In 2021, in ages 25 through 64, the employed people of our nation covered under group life, they experienced a 40% excess mortality.
[00:30:46.232 --> 00:30:55.784]  As quoted by a CEO of an insurance company, just a 10% increase in excess mortality is a three standard deviation event or a once in a 200 year flood.
[00:30:55.844 --> 00:30:57.326]  So 40 is off the charts.
[00:30:59.208 --> 00:31:05.934]   What's interesting about this is that the general overall population Experienced 32% excess mortality.
[00:31:06.494 --> 00:31:14.117]  This group life policy holder subset is much healthier in general than the overall population as done by previous studies.
[00:31:14.538 --> 00:31:18.819]  They experienced mortality, 30 to 40% fat of the general population.
[00:31:18.839 --> 00:31:20.480]  So something flipped in 2021 by eight points.
[00:31:25.097 --> 00:31:31.602]  Early December and hospitals nationwide are once again at full capacity with a trifecta of illness.
[00:31:32.002 --> 00:31:36.365]  COVID, the RSV virus, and a flu season that started six weeks early.
[00:31:36.806 --> 00:31:43.511]  Flu hospitalizations now running at a decade high with 79% of hospital beds occupied.
[00:31:43.771 --> 00:31:47.974]  We need people to be sure to stay home when you're sick.
[00:31:48.174 --> 00:31:52.578]  Nationwide, at least 4,500 flu deaths just since October 1st.
[00:31:52.758 --> 00:31:53.539]  Why the surge?
[00:31:53.979 --> 00:32:03.768]  Infectious disease experts say after several years of pandemic isolation, most Americans are back at school, work, gathering indoors with others, and traveling.
[00:32:03.948 --> 00:32:07.351]  Some exposed to viruses for the first time in two-plus years.
[00:32:07.871 --> 00:32:09.792]  Our immune systems are just fine.
[00:32:09.992 --> 00:32:11.253]  They were ready and waiting.
[00:32:11.653 --> 00:32:14.454]  They just hadn't been exposed to the virus.
[00:32:14.855 --> 00:32:17.676]  This has been an exposure deficit.
[00:32:18.016 --> 00:32:21.758]  So much flu, some pharmacies are running low on flu medication.
[00:32:22.158 --> 00:32:23.179]  This is Jeremiah.
[00:32:23.879 --> 00:32:25.020]  This is my rainbow baby.
[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:32.261]  In Kansas City, Bailey Keel is still mourning the 7-week-old daughter she lost last year to RSV.
[00:32:32.762 --> 00:32:37.703]  Last week, her newborn Jeremiah was admitted to the hospital after he too got sick.
[00:32:37.983 --> 00:32:39.243]  I had nothing but anxiety.
[00:32:39.283 --> 00:32:45.584]  I didn't know if I was going to lose another child or if I was going to be able to keep him with me.
[00:32:45.604 --> 00:32:48.005]  So, it was absolutely scary.
[00:32:48.405 --> 00:32:56.948]  Tonight, the CDC and frontline doctors are urging both adults and children to quickly get a flu vaccine and a COVID booster.
[00:32:57.569 --> 00:33:03.451]  And Tom, the CDC said flu vaccination rates among adults are running at half the levels of pre-pandemic.
[00:33:03.491 --> 00:33:04.231]  Any idea why?
[00:33:04.812 --> 00:33:08.433]  Yeah, health experts believe that there's vaccine fatigue at play here.
[00:33:08.493 --> 00:33:14.355]  People are tired after getting so many COVID shots, now the flu season, and yet the flu also kills.
[00:33:14.656 --> 00:33:15.776]  And the CDC is against...
[00:33:16.192 --> 00:33:22.815]  The Twitter files, the first tranche of which Musk released over the weekend, or on Friday, are just devastating.
[00:33:22.895 --> 00:33:24.016]  It's exactly what I told you.
[00:33:24.736 --> 00:33:28.458]  Government interfacing with think tanks and big tech and dinosaur media.
[00:33:29.698 --> 00:33:38.563]  Surveilling people online and censoring people at the direction of the FBI and the Justice Department and the ADL.
[00:33:39.483 --> 00:33:43.545]  This is a trillion times bigger than anything Richard Nixon did.
[00:33:44.798 --> 00:33:45.178]  Literally.
[00:33:45.198 --> 00:33:50.460]  I mean, it's just, Nixon had a safe with a hundred and something names in it he was thinking about using the IRS on.
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:57.222]  So we've seen Loris Lerner under Obama persecute hundreds of thousands of conservatives and we've seen no one get in trouble.
[00:33:57.362 --> 00:34:03.524]  And so now it's just escalated, escalated, escalated by the deep state when Trump was in office, going after him, going after the American people.
[00:34:03.544 --> 00:34:10.366]  And now we begin to learn what I told you years ago, the full extent of it, because it was all in the government spending documents.
[00:34:10.426 --> 00:34:17.616]   It was in Obama's Challenging Foreign Disinformation and Propaganda Act when he left office in 2017.
[00:34:19.578 --> 00:34:28.105]  He signed those executive orders and Trump never reversed them because he'd never been in government.
[00:34:28.886 --> 00:34:33.529]  I told Trump about it on the phone and that's when my life became a living hell.
[00:34:34.109 --> 00:34:42.955]  So, what I've told you over the decades is that large multinational corporations allied with the dictatorships of the UN run the leadership of the CIA.
[00:34:43.015 --> 00:34:44.236]  That's not my opinion.
[00:34:44.896 --> 00:35:11.105]   And now the Carney Endowment former head publicly runs it and it's come out in the news in the last few months that the CIA specifically, illegally, with the Justice Department is meeting with big tech Corporate dinosaur legacy media and major corporations to set up a social credit score that's already being implemented by stealth to basically debank you, harass you, and later imprison you if you don't go along with them.
[00:35:11.165 --> 00:35:13.986]  So this is a real totalitarian takeover.
[00:35:14.446 --> 00:35:18.327]  And if you watch corporate media, you'll see it on MSNBC, CNN, ABC News.
[00:35:19.028 --> 00:35:19.888]  New clip this weekend.
[00:35:21.249 --> 00:35:24.373]  CIA analysts saying screw your free speech.
[00:35:24.413 --> 00:35:25.134]  It doesn't exist.
[00:35:25.234 --> 00:35:28.499]  Elon Musk is allowing some freedom on Twitter as a Russian agent.
[00:35:30.181 --> 00:35:35.528]  And these guys are just up there saying all of this.
[00:35:36.787 --> 00:35:44.490]  And it's absolutely disgusting and incredibly un-American, but that's what they're doing.
[00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:47.431]  And we're going to get to that in a moment, but first, it's all over the world.
[00:35:47.711 --> 00:35:51.972]  Ireland government plans to imprison people for possession of hate speech.
[00:35:51.992 --> 00:35:52.952]  And what do they define that as?
[00:35:52.992 --> 00:35:54.053]  Not Nazi flags.
[00:35:54.473 --> 00:35:56.233]  They always said you ban those, next it's everything.
[00:35:56.754 --> 00:35:57.514]  Not the N-word.
[00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.810]  No.
[00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:08.454]  Denying transgenderism, denying two men can have a baby, denying open borders are a good thing, questioning election fraud, questioning lockdowns, questioning forced injections.
[00:36:08.774 --> 00:36:09.935]  It's all UN-run.
[00:36:09.955 --> 00:36:16.558]  The UN said a month ago, their head of global speech policy said, oh yeah, we run big tech.
[00:36:16.998 --> 00:36:19.519]  We create the orders, give it to their governments, they implement it.
[00:36:19.539 --> 00:36:20.059]  It continues.
[00:36:20.119 --> 00:36:22.020]  CNN calls freedom of speech nonsense.
[00:36:23.644 --> 00:36:36.530]   In rant accusing Elon Musk of being a Russian asset, CNN peddled more fake news than usual Friday when a former CIA agent Accused Elon Musk of working on Russia's behalf by freeing up Twitter, calling free speech nonsense.
[00:36:36.891 --> 00:36:57.307]  Former CIA case officer Bob Behrs, been on the show before, condemned Musk's recent decision to grant General Amnesty for formerly banned accounts, claiming that exactly what Russian President Vladimir Putin wants, all the debunked Russiagate crap, but now we've got to censor the American people because free speech is nonsense, because the CIA says so.
[00:36:58.848 --> 00:37:00.410]  We'll play that clip and then get to this.
[00:37:01.591 --> 00:37:03.273]  England's now outlawing the Bible.
[00:37:04.273 --> 00:37:05.194]  We'll get to that in a moment.
[00:37:05.374 --> 00:37:08.877]  Here is the CIA on TV saying your First Amendment's nonsense.
[00:37:08.917 --> 00:37:09.298]  Here it is.
[00:37:10.788 --> 00:37:24.098]  And it gets more and more challenging to discern what's real and what is, you know, misinformation or disinformation with deep fakes and with the sophistication by which some of these influence campaigns are developed.
[00:37:24.538 --> 00:37:31.263]  How do you discern what's real versus what's fake even, you know, in light of that sophistication?
[00:37:33.482 --> 00:37:38.205]  Well, that's why the pre-Musk Twitter had 7,000 people going through these accounts.
[00:37:38.285 --> 00:37:39.886]  You can pick them out with algorithms.
[00:37:39.926 --> 00:37:41.667]  You can pick them out by looking at them.
[00:37:42.827 --> 00:37:44.908]  You can check IPs and the rest of it.
[00:37:45.729 --> 00:37:46.709]  And you simply block them.
[00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:49.291]  And it's not right.
[00:37:49.391 --> 00:37:54.994]   And you know, this freedom of speech is just That's nonsense, because you can't go into a movie theater and yell, fire, it's against the law.
[00:37:55.634 --> 00:38:03.258]  What Putin's going to do, and the Russians, is they're going to use this as a vehicle to save himself and Ukraine.
[00:38:03.458 --> 00:38:05.599]  And you know, whether it's going to work or not, I don't know.
[00:38:05.639 --> 00:38:11.102]  But we're going to see, as soon as these restrictions come off, we're going to see the Russians all over it, as I just said.
[00:38:12.383 --> 00:38:19.767]  So if you had an opportunity to offer a piece of advice to Elon Musk, or to counsel him, or simply to send him a message, what would you say?
[00:38:22.293 --> 00:38:27.217]  I'd say this libertarian nonsense is destructive to American national security.
[00:38:27.397 --> 00:38:33.502]  And he has got to reinstitute the same restrictions that were on Twitter before he bought it.
[00:38:33.822 --> 00:38:35.123]  There is no other choice.
[00:38:35.143 --> 00:38:35.983]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:38:36.023 --> 00:38:38.986]  So there is the CIA operative.
[00:38:40.111 --> 00:38:42.392]  Saying we need to be like North Korea or Communist China.
[00:38:42.492 --> 00:38:44.634]  Why don't you move there, Bob?
[00:38:44.814 --> 00:38:46.735]  If it's so much safer and so much better.
[00:38:47.015 --> 00:38:48.076]  It's all made up.
[00:38:48.316 --> 00:38:50.397]  They're the ones that lied about the COVID virus.
[00:38:50.597 --> 00:38:52.979]  They're the ones that lied about its kill rate and yelled fire in a theater.
[00:38:53.219 --> 00:38:57.562]  They're the ones that pushed a deadly experimental shot that he knows killing people and now they're targeting newborn babies.
[00:38:57.942 --> 00:38:59.703]  Shame on you and Fauci!
[00:39:00.939 --> 00:39:07.861]  You're engaged in illegal domestic operations of the CIA using lies and deception against the American people, and it's all admitted.
[00:39:08.122 --> 00:39:08.762]  And now this.
[00:39:09.242 --> 00:39:16.144]  Crown Prosecution Services says it's no longer appropriate to quote some passages from the Bible in public, including in your church.
[00:39:16.244 --> 00:39:17.585]  You will be arrested.
[00:39:18.225 --> 00:39:18.605]  Breaking!
[00:39:18.685 --> 00:39:23.087]  Elon Musk says there are more smoking gums to come, and he's not suicidal.
[00:39:24.628 --> 00:39:25.529]  I am not suicidal.
[00:39:25.589 --> 00:39:26.629]  I'm totally alive.
[00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:30.292]  If they ever kill me and say I killed myself, they murdered me 100%.
[00:39:31.793 --> 00:39:32.553]  I love life.
[00:39:34.975 --> 00:39:36.116]  None of this pressure gets to me.
[00:39:36.176 --> 00:39:40.579]  It empowers me because of the strength and will and determination God gave me.
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:44.101]  Very smart comment by Elon Musk.
[00:39:44.121 --> 00:39:45.802]  Whether he's good or bad, he's taking them on.
[00:39:46.123 --> 00:39:49.905]  And the first tranche he released, he says dozens more, over 20 more things coming.
[00:39:50.205 --> 00:39:52.507]  Matt Tehimi says he has thousands of pages at Rolling Stone.
[00:39:53.351 --> 00:39:56.052]  Proving the government's manipulated the 2020 election.
[00:39:56.412 --> 00:40:00.754]  Proving they suppress information about toxins and poisons in the vaccines.
[00:40:02.834 --> 00:40:04.235]  It's all coming out.
[00:40:05.716 --> 00:40:06.856]  Here's Matt Taibbi's thread.
[00:40:08.517 --> 00:40:14.939]  He goes on to say, it's an incredible story from the inside, thousands of pages, dozens of reports, coming.
[00:40:16.914 --> 00:40:24.856]  And then we've got the full videos on Infowars.com, an article that James Woods videos posted in by Jamie White.
[00:40:26.328 --> 00:40:40.498]  It's a 10-minute interview with Tucker Friday, when James Woods learns what he already knew, that he was specifically targeted in the messages recorded by Twitter executives, that he would be taken off the air because he was too popular getting Republicans elected.
[00:40:40.558 --> 00:40:48.844]  Direct criminal election meddling, everything they told you the Russians were doing, when quite frankly, as you've seen in Ukraine, the Russians have a primitive military.
[00:40:49.084 --> 00:40:51.566]  When it comes to propaganda, they're like a two-year-old.
[00:40:53.024 --> 00:40:53.965]  Compared to the New World Order.
[00:40:54.005 --> 00:41:05.374]  Nothing against the Russians, but as I've been telling you, I've studied it, the Russians are a joke when it comes to comparing themselves to Hollywood and the DNC and the Deep State.
[00:41:06.475 --> 00:41:07.295]  It's ridiculous.
[00:41:08.216 --> 00:41:11.238]  They've got 40-year-old military equipment compared to ours.
[00:41:11.258 --> 00:41:14.641]  You hear our media say they've got all these advanced weapons.
[00:41:14.921 --> 00:41:17.003]  None of it's true, other than they're nuclear weapons.
[00:41:19.005 --> 00:41:25.035]   So, That's the reality that James Woods has now discovered he was targeted.
[00:41:25.055 --> 00:41:29.839]  And Tucker brings up the fact that I was targeted for destruction as well.
[00:41:29.899 --> 00:41:47.971]  The World Economic Forum came out last Friday and said there are lying people claiming we want global government and that we control governments and that we want to cut off resources and they need to be censored and shut up.
[00:41:49.471 --> 00:41:55.017]  Oh, and they also said, they're lying people claiming we're controlling governments and big tech and we're censoring.
[00:41:56.139 --> 00:41:58.161]  So, we want them censored.
[00:41:58.201 --> 00:42:01.124]  In fact, I meant to get to that Friday, and I never got to it.
[00:42:01.144 --> 00:42:02.486]  Can you guys pull up some of the articles?
[00:42:02.726 --> 00:42:04.288]  It was a press release by the WEF.
[00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:10.115]  WEF, WEF chairwoman.
[00:42:11.699 --> 00:42:26.104]  And then she gave an interview, but they also put a press release out, and they were, again, talking about, they claim we censor, they claim we're in control, they claim we want world government, they claim we want to turn off the resources, and the answer to that is, censor them and turn their resources off!
[00:42:28.025 --> 00:42:44.205]   I mean, you talk about gaslighting, I could sit here for 10 hours, and just play you clips of them, we're gonna put chips in you, we're gonna break up your family, we're gonna take over your body, the post-human world's here, You'll own nothing, you'll have nothing, you will eat the bugs.
[00:42:46.106 --> 00:42:53.932]  And now everywhere, in public schools around the West, they're telling children, hey, your hamburger buns are made out of crickets.
[00:42:56.694 --> 00:42:58.475]  Yeah, there's one of the WEF's own releases.
[00:42:59.256 --> 00:43:00.216]  That was a few weeks ago.
[00:43:00.737 --> 00:43:03.679]  Solution to online abuse, AI plus human intelligence.
[00:43:05.626 --> 00:43:08.727]  The press release on Friday was, there is disinformation.
[00:43:09.287 --> 00:43:17.730]  If we don't back this down or slow this down, very soon, you're gonna look back on these broadcasts and just say, oh my God, it's happening exactly like you said.
[00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:22.052]  And so, they said your local business was not essential to destroy you!
[00:43:23.149 --> 00:43:28.692]  And to force adoption on to robotics and centralization to make us even more obsolete.
[00:43:28.872 --> 00:43:36.036]  And I see all the Bloomberg articles and all of them showing, well, the pandemic caused record move to lay off humans and bring in robots.
[00:43:36.896 --> 00:43:38.577]  It really helped the robot revolution.
[00:43:39.557 --> 00:43:43.757]   Robots really were failing and weren't being adopted but the but this brought him over the edge
[00:43:43.757 --> 00:44:04.625]   Because you want it here's another one just for you Because without you, it would truly be a blue Christmas.
[00:44:05.165 --> 00:44:13.309]  But thank God that we have you, all of us, awakening and vibrant souls all over the Earth.
[00:44:14.129 --> 00:44:18.811]  It's your love, our love, that makes all of this possible.

[00:44:46.182 --> 00:45:09.061]   InfoWarsStore.com InfoWars
[00:45:09.218 --> 00:45:10.118]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:45:10.419 --> 00:45:10.819]  Today.
[00:45:13.401 --> 00:45:24.432]   What also is concerning in the Scandinavian data, which I was sharing with you, is that when you start mixing them, In 2020, when we had the massive assault with COVID-19, we didn't have an increase in stillbirth.
[00:45:24.252 --> 00:45:28.812]   going to get Pfizer and then a Moderna or something like that, that data was more concerning.
[00:45:28.812 --> 00:45:30.732]  The odds ratios were higher in those.
[00:45:30.732 --> 00:45:36.691]   In 2020 when we had the massive assault with COVID-19, we didn't have an increase in stillbirth.
[00:45:36.691 --> 00:45:44.852]   That stillbirth rate actually dropped, dropped down to 5.73 from about 5.83 per thousand
[00:45:44.852 --> 00:45:48.572]  births, which was the aggregate of the three prior years.
[00:45:48.587 --> 00:45:54.474]  So again, in your field, you didn't see that impact in terms of health outcomes from the disease.
[00:45:55.075 --> 00:45:57.018]  Only tell the vaccine was rolled out.
[00:45:57.338 --> 00:45:58.519]  That's correct.
[00:45:58.739 --> 00:46:04.461]  In 2020, the massive assault of COVID-19 on everybody, including my pregnant mother, I did not see this rise.
[00:46:04.682 --> 00:46:07.363]  The rise was not seen until after the vaccine.
[00:46:07.823 --> 00:46:13.486]  And I have vital statistics of our national, vital statistics to prove that.
[00:46:16.542 --> 00:46:17.102]  It's blank.
[00:46:17.683 --> 00:46:18.503]  Boom.
[00:46:18.523 --> 00:46:19.804]  There it is.
[00:46:20.504 --> 00:46:22.366]  It says intentionally blank on it.
[00:46:22.866 --> 00:46:31.371]  That's the data that pharmacists and physicians are basing on giving the injections outside of mainstream media recommendations.
[00:46:31.611 --> 00:46:37.655]  I would like to make this point for anyone who is considering getting their children vaccinated.
[00:46:39.099 --> 00:46:40.900]  And we've had a hard lesson learned.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.122]  We've had soldiers who have gotten vaccinated, who've been destroyed.
[00:46:45.142 --> 00:46:49.344]  You've heard victims up here who've been destroyed by this vaccine.
[00:46:50.204 --> 00:46:55.467]  An EUA product means you have no legal recourse.
[00:46:56.471 --> 00:46:58.713]  You could give that vaccine to your child.
[00:46:58.773 --> 00:47:02.977]  They could drop dead the next day or end up in a wheelchair like Mattie Gray.
[00:47:03.938 --> 00:47:09.504]  And you have no ability to sue the pharmaceutical companies, just like my soldiers.
[00:47:11.152 --> 00:47:20.718]  They said it was FDA approved, yet they have not produced any FDA approved vaccines with corresponding lot numbers.
[00:47:21.578 --> 00:47:24.760]  And it is the lot number off of that vial.
[00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:32.865]  It doesn't matter if the EUA product and the FDA approved product have exactly the same ingredients in that vial.
[00:47:34.286 --> 00:47:35.507]  It is the lot number.
[00:47:36.696 --> 00:47:46.379]  That corresponds to either an EUA product or an FDA approved product that gives you the ability to legal recourse.
[00:47:46.599 --> 00:48:03.403]  And once this vaccine was put on the childhood vaccine schedule, the pharmaceutical companies have complete and permanent indemnity from legal recourse should anything happen to you or your children.
[00:48:04.679 --> 00:48:16.686]  And our soldiers have been forced to take an EUA product even though it is illegal to mandate service members be injected with an EUA product.
[00:48:17.006 --> 00:48:24.450]   The excess mortality has shifted so much so that it's It's pretty phenomenal what you see here in the charts before you.
[00:48:24.911 --> 00:48:26.052]  This is not my data.
[00:48:26.072 --> 00:48:28.994]  This is the Society of Actuaries.
[00:48:29.194 --> 00:48:38.381]  In 2021, in ages 25 through 64, the employed people of our nation covered under group life, they experienced a 40% excess mortality.
[00:48:39.022 --> 00:48:48.549]  As quoted by a CEO of an insurance company, just a 10% increase in excess mortality is a three standard deviation event or once in a 200 year flood.
[00:48:48.609 --> 00:48:50.050]  So 40 is off the charts.
[00:48:51.051 --> 00:48:58.694]  Um, what's interesting about this is that the general overall population experienced 32% excess mortality.
[00:48:59.255 --> 00:49:06.878]  This group life, uh, policy holder subset is much healthier in general than the overall population as done by previous studies.
[00:49:07.298 --> 00:49:11.580]  They experienced mortality, 30 to 40% fat of the general population.
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:12.600]  So something flipped in 2021.
[00:49:14.341 --> 00:49:15.202]  By eight points.
[00:49:16.023 --> 00:49:17.404]  Go on to the next slide, please.
[00:49:18.806 --> 00:49:22.570]  For disability, this is the next data set is the U.S.
[00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:25.373]  Bureau, the U.S.
[00:49:25.393 --> 00:49:26.974]  Department of Bureau of Labor Statistics.
[00:49:27.615 --> 00:49:28.776]  It's pretty simple here.
[00:49:29.597 --> 00:49:32.900]   We saw disability What's up, guys?
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.441]  Welcome back to InfoWars.
[00:49:35.141 --> 00:49:38.784]  Alex got the call, so he can't be here ever again.
[00:49:38.644 --> 00:49:43.903]   there was this three sigma event, three standard deviation, rate of change year over year.
[00:49:43.903 --> 00:49:51.063]   And what we found particularly interesting was that the employed of our country.
[00:49:51.063 --> 00:49:54.304]  What's up guys, welcome back to Info Wars.
[00:49:54.304 --> 00:49:58.104]  Alex got the call, so he can't be here ever again.
[00:49:58.104 --> 00:50:01.424]  He's gotta go pay off his 2.7 trillion dollar debt.
[00:50:01.424 --> 00:50:04.384]   So I'm gonna be taking over the show and the network forever now.
[00:50:04.345 --> 00:50:06.407]  I got my friends here, Nett and YooHoo.
[00:50:06.427 --> 00:50:07.528]  Nett and YooHoo!
[00:50:07.548 --> 00:50:09.109]  Nett and YooHoo!
[00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:12.031]  It's really hard to find a Nett, by the way.
[00:50:12.192 --> 00:50:15.234]  We had to get this pool thing that gets the leaves out of your pool.
[00:50:16.815 --> 00:50:19.137]  But it's easy to find YooHoo here in the South Bronx.
[00:50:20.138 --> 00:50:21.139]  What is YooHoo?
[00:50:22.219 --> 00:50:24.361]  Like, why not just have chocolate milk?
[00:50:25.082 --> 00:50:26.943]  It's water with chocolate flavoring?
[00:50:28.564 --> 00:50:30.226]  We have Yay in the studio.
[00:50:31.024 --> 00:50:32.145]  Can we talk to you yet, Ye?
[00:50:35.266 --> 00:50:39.828]  I can't really see right now exactly where I am.
[00:50:41.129 --> 00:50:49.873]  Now, you say that you hate Jews and you're a Nazi and you love Hitler, but you're being metaphorical when you say that, right?
[00:50:50.553 --> 00:50:50.713]  Nope.
[00:50:53.215 --> 00:50:57.757]  We've got some footage of Ye and Alex on the show.
[00:50:59.159 --> 00:51:03.601]  When Ye was on with Netanyahu, it wasn't the first time they've had this discussion.
[00:51:03.802 --> 00:51:05.702]  They had this discussion in the movie Anchorman.
[00:51:06.123 --> 00:51:06.563]  You got that?
[00:51:07.543 --> 00:51:11.365]  Every human being has something of value that they brought to the table.
[00:51:12.065 --> 00:51:13.046]  Especially Hitler.
[00:51:16.768 --> 00:51:21.490]  There's a lot of things that I love about Hitler.
[00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:23.631]  A lot of things.
[00:51:25.071 --> 00:51:25.832]  Take it easy, champ.
[00:51:26.732 --> 00:51:28.093]  Why don't you stop talking for a while?
[00:51:29.168 --> 00:51:30.770]  I, uh, did he say it like that?
[00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:32.271]  Or did they change it in the editing?
[00:51:32.291 --> 00:51:35.473]  I don't remember him going a lot of things I like about Hitler.
[00:51:35.553 --> 00:51:39.336]  That seems to be the meme now that that's, no, that that's how that went.
[00:51:39.437 --> 00:51:40.157]  Is that how it went?
[00:51:40.337 --> 00:51:40.577]  It did.
[00:51:40.597 --> 00:51:41.778]  I don't know.
[00:51:41.798 --> 00:51:44.200]  I thought when I did my interview with Ye, it went really well.
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:46.142]  I don't think anyone else did.
[00:51:47.923 --> 00:51:49.284]  And I love the Alex one, too.
[00:51:49.945 --> 00:51:54.769]  It was the most entertaining television since the Sex Pistols were kicked off Bill Grundy.
[00:51:56.036 --> 00:51:59.479]  And that was holding the top spot since 1977.
[00:52:00.099 --> 00:52:00.400]  Boom!
[00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:01.941]  Bye, Johnny Rotten.
[00:52:02.662 --> 00:52:04.643]  Bye, Glenn Matlock.
[00:52:04.723 --> 00:52:09.847]  Bye, Paul Cook and Steve Jones and Susie Asu of Susie and the Banshees and Catwoman.
[00:52:10.228 --> 00:52:10.788]  Bye-bye!
[00:52:11.449 --> 00:52:12.329]  Home to Mommy!
[00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:14.871]  She probably likes me.
[00:52:17.113 --> 00:52:19.735]  We have a lot of Alex Jones, Nick and Milo stuff here.
[00:52:19.755 --> 00:52:20.896]  We have...
[00:52:23.935 --> 00:52:24.896]  I don't know what the gossip is.
[00:52:24.916 --> 00:52:26.216]  I'm looking forward to talking to Alex.
[00:52:26.276 --> 00:52:27.296]  I was just kidding, by the way.
[00:52:27.316 --> 00:52:31.478]  He is not fired from his own network.
[00:52:31.618 --> 00:52:32.878]  Nick put out this tweet.
[00:52:33.218 --> 00:52:34.279]  Alex got the call.
[00:52:34.839 --> 00:52:39.000]  I think Nick feels like Alex is no longer backing him or something.
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:40.801]  So I want to get that gossip.
[00:52:41.081 --> 00:52:41.681]  Have you got that?
[00:52:43.822 --> 00:52:46.123]  Fuentes responds to Alex Jones' baby Hitler attack.
[00:52:46.783 --> 00:52:49.624]  But wasn't Alex saying what other people were calling him?
[00:52:49.944 --> 00:52:52.485]  Like Jimmy Kimmel called him baby Hitler?
[00:52:54.503 --> 00:52:54.883]  Oh yeah.
[00:52:55.183 --> 00:53:06.029]  It feels like everyone on this side is so paranoid about treachery and disloyalty that the second we see anyone on our team act a little weird, we're like, fuck you, you're dead to me.
[00:53:06.049 --> 00:53:07.950]  I don't know if we can curse.
[00:53:07.991 --> 00:53:09.051]  Oh, we can't curse on the show.
[00:53:11.052 --> 00:53:12.313]  What happened to you there, Ye?
[00:53:13.033 --> 00:53:13.994]  Why are you adjusting your hair?
[00:53:17.637 --> 00:53:19.578]  I don't really want to talk about that right now.
[00:53:20.379 --> 00:53:22.380]  Um, so I'm gonna go ahead and let you finish.
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:24.501]  Are you sure your audio is coming through here?
[00:53:24.582 --> 00:53:25.582]  We've never done this before.
[00:53:25.602 --> 00:53:25.902]  Uh, yes.
[00:53:26.743 --> 00:53:27.023]  Okay.
[00:53:28.124 --> 00:53:29.865]  Um, and then this clip is going viral.
[00:53:30.245 --> 00:53:32.066]  I think what happened was... Oh, hey, yay.
[00:53:34.248 --> 00:53:35.308]  Your hands look really white.
[00:53:35.328 --> 00:53:37.470]  Do you have food poisoning or something?
[00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:39.471]  Uh, they're gloves.
[00:53:40.011 --> 00:53:40.592]  Oh, they're gloves.
[00:53:40.692 --> 00:53:40.892]  Okay.
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:50.403]  Uh, I think Alex was saying, you know, Nick has closeted about, I don't know, some his views in some way, and then he realized, oh wait, that's a gay metaphor.
[00:53:50.683 --> 00:53:52.623]  So then he says, I wasn't making a gay metaphor, by the way.
[00:53:52.683 --> 00:53:54.684]  And then Crowder's people seem to have run with it.
[00:53:57.225 --> 00:53:58.425]  Nick Fuentes is a homosexual.
[00:53:58.545 --> 00:53:59.806]  I don't want to say this.
[00:53:59.886 --> 00:54:01.706]  I'm not saying Nick Fuentes is a homosexual.
[00:54:02.246 --> 00:54:04.967]  What I am saying is... Mom, seriously.
[00:54:06.108 --> 00:54:06.948]  It wasn't a joke.
[00:54:07.448 --> 00:54:08.928]  What do you lead with that?
[00:54:08.948 --> 00:54:10.209]  Where do you go from there, Alex?
[00:54:11.102 --> 00:54:23.604]  I don't want to say this, I'm not... One of the good things about being a hipster conservative, which I guess I am, is we don't have this sort of Achilles heel where if someone's gay, all bets are off and they lose all their support.
[00:54:24.265 --> 00:54:27.205]  I don't think Nick's gay, but I could not care less.
[00:54:28.065 --> 00:54:29.866]  I think that bothers a lot of gays too.
[00:54:30.286 --> 00:54:34.807]  That's why they call it homophobia, because like, you're scared of what I do in the bedroom.
[00:54:35.567 --> 00:54:36.307]  Why would I care?
[00:54:37.239 --> 00:54:41.560]  The analogy I always use is, say you knew a straight couple and they only did anal.
[00:54:42.401 --> 00:54:45.842]  Would you want to know about that when you hung out with them and had a double date?
[00:54:46.682 --> 00:54:47.922]  No, I don't think you would.
[00:54:48.202 --> 00:54:50.203]  I think you'd rather they kept that to themselves.
[00:54:50.823 --> 00:54:53.664]  So these guys, we're not homophobic, we're homo-bored.
[00:54:53.944 --> 00:55:06.208]  And if someone that I follow or, you know, I'm inspired by or listen to is a staunch conservative and also turns out to be gay, I'm yawning.
[00:55:08.292 --> 00:55:17.760]  Uh, also in the news, I realized that, uh, Ye and Nick and I have been connected in many ways for many years.
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:24.485]  Like six years ago, I was saying this on my show, Nick called into my show.
[00:55:24.545 --> 00:55:25.826]  He was in high school at the time.
[00:55:25.966 --> 00:55:27.768]  And he said, yeah, you like entrepreneurs?
[00:55:27.968 --> 00:55:30.249]  Um, what do you think of this guy, Kanye West?
[00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:31.611]  I'm not dead naming him.
[00:55:31.651 --> 00:55:32.771]  That was his name at the time.
[00:55:33.532 --> 00:55:34.553]  And I said, I think he's great.
[00:55:36.815 --> 00:55:40.196]  Back then he was seen just as a musician, six years ago.
[00:55:40.236 --> 00:55:42.697]  And I said, I hope this new album, it was Life of Pablo at the time.
[00:55:42.997 --> 00:55:44.018]  I hope that lives up to the hype.
[00:55:44.638 --> 00:55:44.998]  And it did.
[00:55:45.018 --> 00:55:45.678]  It was good.
[00:55:46.899 --> 00:55:56.503]  And then he was also on Milo Yiannopoulos' show six, no, this was four years ago.
[00:55:57.188 --> 00:55:59.450]  How can you be against interracial marriages?
[00:55:59.470 --> 00:56:00.071]  Isn't that insane?
[00:56:00.211 --> 00:56:01.432]  Is mine okay because we're not breeding?
[00:56:01.252 --> 00:56:05.252]  But Milo says, "So why are you against interracial marriage?
[00:56:05.252 --> 00:56:10.252]   Am I safe because my interracial marriage is because I'm gay?"
[00:56:10.252 --> 00:56:12.252]  And then you have Nick's reaction.
[00:56:12.252 --> 00:56:14.252]   How can you be against interracial marriages? Isn't that insane?
[00:56:14.252 --> 00:56:15.252]  Why is that insane?
[00:56:15.252 --> 00:56:17.252]  Is mine okay because we're not breeding?
[00:56:17.252 --> 00:56:18.252]  Uh, no.
[00:56:18.252 --> 00:56:19.252]  It's actually worse!
[00:56:19.252 --> 00:56:21.252]  [laughter]
[00:56:21.252 --> 00:56:23.252]  Okay, because you are homosexual.
[00:56:23.759 --> 00:56:29.000]  In case you didn't get it, Nick is so charming.
[00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:32.701]  I honestly think he's going to be President of the United States in 25 years.
[00:56:33.181 --> 00:56:35.141]  This PC pendulum is going to swing back.
[00:56:35.361 --> 00:56:36.902]  It's going to swing real slow.
[00:56:37.682 --> 00:56:43.583]  As Alexis de Tocqueville noted in Democracy in America, was that the name of his book?
[00:56:44.395 --> 00:56:53.686]  He goes, democracy is like a big stone ball, and it moves very, very slowly with the will of the people.
[00:56:53.987 --> 00:56:57.551]  But once it starts getting momentum, nothing can stop it.
[00:56:58.352 --> 00:57:04.840]   So I'm optimistic about the future, but Don't get excited about the next four years, maybe even the next 10 years.
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:06.941]  We're going to get another term with Biden.
[00:57:07.342 --> 00:57:10.064]  He's going, his mental acuity is going to fall off a cliff.
[00:57:10.084 --> 00:57:10.945]  You think he's bad now?
[00:57:11.365 --> 00:57:14.688]  He's just going to see an eight-year-old girl and go, titties.
[00:57:15.388 --> 00:57:16.069]  Come on, man.
[00:57:16.469 --> 00:57:18.110]  Let me touch the titties.
[00:57:18.391 --> 00:57:19.732]  He's saying titties like songs.
[00:57:19.792 --> 00:57:21.333]  Anyway, let's, and they'll shuffle him out of the room.
[00:57:21.373 --> 00:57:22.974]  Like he's going to, he's going to be gone.
[00:57:23.355 --> 00:57:26.998]  So it'll be four years of Weekend at Bernie's, but it's going to happen.
[00:57:27.038 --> 00:57:29.720]  And eventually people will go, all right, I've had enough of this.
[00:57:31.498 --> 00:57:33.599]  Did you see this picture going around of him, by the way?
[00:57:33.879 --> 00:57:35.960]  Look at your email under Creepy Joe.
[00:57:37.261 --> 00:57:38.962]  We've gone past sniffing now.
[00:57:40.002 --> 00:57:43.604]  Now it's, I put a hand here and then I just want to touch your smooth, smooth skin.
[00:57:44.124 --> 00:57:46.245]  So, Joe Biden yesterday at the beach in Delaware.
[00:57:46.265 --> 00:57:47.265]  Zoom in on that now.
[00:57:48.926 --> 00:57:52.488]  So, it looks relatively innocuous at first glance, right?
[00:57:53.208 --> 00:57:57.550]  But then, what is going on there on her lower back?
[00:57:58.291 --> 00:58:04.114]  Is that his right hand, like, kind of scooping into... I mean, should we even be showing this on InfoWars?
[00:58:04.154 --> 00:58:04.995]  Is this porn?
[00:58:05.775 --> 00:58:08.716]  Are we accidentally showing kiddie porn while we discuss the President?
[00:58:08.736 --> 00:58:15.580]  It's not a good situation to be in, where you're wary to discuss the leader of the free world in case you show kiddie porn.
[00:58:17.541 --> 00:58:18.541]  Not a good situation.
[00:58:20.683 --> 00:58:23.164]  Also in yay news, um...
[00:58:24.614 --> 00:58:26.096]  I thought this was an interesting article.
[00:58:26.557 --> 00:58:29.782]  So it's a hit piece on me and my yay interview.
[00:58:29.802 --> 00:58:31.845]  Uh, 2-1.
[00:58:35.191 --> 00:58:38.256]  And, uh, Kanye West.
[00:58:38.276 --> 00:58:39.678]  He deadnames them right out of the gate.
[00:58:40.254 --> 00:58:51.723]  And anyway, this guy is ridiculing my theory that white people blame Jews for ethnomazakism and anti-Americanism and anti-Westernism.
[00:58:52.283 --> 00:58:56.106]  And my contention is, no, it's a trait that's in white people.
[00:58:56.526 --> 00:58:58.268]  For some reason, white people are like lemmings.
[00:58:58.368 --> 00:59:02.010]  And when they get to a certain amount of success, they want to walk off a cliff.
[00:59:02.371 --> 00:59:09.584]   That's why when you see commercials and it's like, it's about euthanasia, Or, uh, medically assisted death.
[00:59:09.684 --> 00:59:11.124]  It's always white people in the commercial.
[00:59:11.604 --> 00:59:14.085]  And when it's about having babies and stuff, it's always mixed race.
[00:59:14.485 --> 00:59:16.486]  Because white women see that and they like it.
[00:59:17.086 --> 00:59:19.367]  They like the idea of white people being extinct.
[00:59:19.487 --> 00:59:19.987]  I don't know why.
[00:59:20.687 --> 00:59:21.368]  Liberals love it.
[00:59:22.088 --> 00:59:29.150]  And the fact that you see Jews overrepresented in media and stuff also saying this, it is, is, they're just white people.
[00:59:30.031 --> 00:59:31.871]  I always say Jews are just white people that don't drink.
[00:59:32.231 --> 00:59:33.392]  That's why they're so successful.
[00:59:33.772 --> 00:59:35.292]  I'm hungover right now, for example.
[00:59:35.933 --> 00:59:37.053]  Couldn't go to the gym this morning.
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:38.841]  And we're back!
[00:59:39.301 --> 00:59:48.408]  I would just like to say, I can't make this clear enough, that doing an Alex Jones impersonation is the most hack impression you can do next to Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:59:49.108 --> 00:59:49.569]  It's lame.
[00:59:50.029 --> 00:59:50.489]  Don't do it.
[00:59:51.550 --> 00:59:52.711]  Everybody's got one, folks.
[00:59:52.771 --> 00:59:53.852]  That's why I don't even try it.
[00:59:54.052 --> 00:59:57.315]  It's just a Texas accent with a hoarse throat.
[00:59:57.375 --> 00:59:58.175]  That's not hard.
[00:59:58.516 --> 01:00:00.077]  Yay is hard.
[01:00:01.138 --> 01:00:06.802]  It's like a gentle, nice, small, black guy.
[01:00:07.634 --> 01:00:09.315]  He's from the south side of Chicago.
[01:00:09.636 --> 01:00:12.718]  He does not sound remotely like someone from the south side of Chicago.
[01:00:13.398 --> 01:00:17.301]  He looks like someone who was trapped in a box and just got out.
[01:00:17.881 --> 01:00:28.969]  Like he was a survivalist and he was in sort of a bunker and then he just learned that there was a nuclear war and he didn't need to be in there and he opens a hatch and he's like, hi, so this is it?
[01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:31.831]  There was no nuclear war this entire time?
[01:00:31.851 --> 01:00:33.833]  No, yay, get out, come on.
[01:00:35.283 --> 01:00:47.471]  I don't know, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna let you finish in a second, but I don't know if you saw my interview with Sway, but I was very angry, right?
[01:00:47.531 --> 01:00:48.552]  I was yelling a lot.
[01:00:48.592 --> 01:00:54.556]  Yeah, he got in a fight with Sway like a hundred years ago, and when we're at the interview, Ryan's like, hey, I can do a Sway!
[01:00:54.576 --> 01:00:55.576]  I can do Sway!
[01:00:55.596 --> 01:00:57.738]  And then he's like, yo, do the Sway!
[01:00:58.610 --> 01:00:59.371]  Hey, what's up, guys?
[01:00:59.451 --> 01:01:00.112]  It's me, Sway.
[01:01:00.132 --> 01:01:02.053]  We're in the morning with MTV News.
[01:01:02.073 --> 01:01:05.116]  Yeah, and you like that as a fan, a rap fan.
[01:01:05.457 --> 01:01:09.460]  But for him, that was just like some days, eight years ago that he doesn't remember.
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:11.582]  And he's like, why did you learn that impression?
[01:01:11.662 --> 01:01:12.383]  Why did you learn that?
[01:01:12.784 --> 01:01:15.906]  He was smiling at it, and he was also very confused.
[01:01:15.926 --> 01:01:18.569]  No, he was smiling in a way where he's like, who is this clown?
[01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:20.571]  Well, he liked my Trump.
[01:01:21.477 --> 01:01:28.639]  It's like when I was doing a British accent talking about Tommy Robinson, because I said, someone said, you seem so fearless, like you're not worried about anything.
[01:01:29.319 --> 01:01:30.679]  And I go, I know what's going on.
[01:01:30.699 --> 01:01:33.940]  I saw the same thing with Tommy Robinson and with Alex Jones, by the way.
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:37.621]  You get to this point of fear where, like, there's a noise outside and you get your gun.
[01:01:37.941 --> 01:01:41.362]  That's that's like year one of being cancelled and attacked and harassed.
[01:01:41.442 --> 01:01:47.244]  And then after a while, you stop carrying around pepper spray and a knife and you're just like, what are you going to do, bitch?
[01:01:47.924 --> 01:01:48.324]  Go ahead.
[01:01:49.119 --> 01:01:50.060]  And that's the vibe I got from him.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:53.182]  And I said to Kanye, I go, and Tommy said the same thing.
[01:01:53.202 --> 01:01:58.945]  He's like, look, what's going on is you get to a certain level where your adrenaline gland just dies and you're no longer scared.
[01:01:58.985 --> 01:02:02.307]  You walk anywhere, you're, I mean, you're not stupid, but you're fearless.
[01:02:03.188 --> 01:02:10.912]  And then, and Ye was looking at me like, and he goes, you got so many good accents, but you can't do gay and you can't do a woman.
[01:02:11.713 --> 01:02:12.753]  In fact, they're the same thing.
[01:02:12.773 --> 01:02:15.295]  He's so amused by everyone.
[01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:17.850]  Hey, Yay, I wanted to ask you.
[01:02:18.251 --> 01:02:19.031]  Do you remember this?
[01:02:19.051 --> 01:02:20.051]  2-2?
[01:02:20.552 --> 01:02:24.493]  When Macklemore dressed as a Jew and Zeke Hylde on stage?
[01:02:25.594 --> 01:02:27.695]  Um... No.
[01:02:30.276 --> 01:02:30.976]  Well, pull it up.
[01:02:31.196 --> 01:02:31.796]  It happened.
[01:02:32.516 --> 01:02:34.217]  And there was this much blowback.
[01:02:35.038 --> 01:02:36.798]  Now, it's not because Macklemore's Jewish.
[01:02:36.838 --> 01:02:37.138]  He's not.
[01:02:37.178 --> 01:02:37.619]  He's me.
[01:02:37.639 --> 01:02:38.419]  He's Scotch-Irish.
[01:02:39.199 --> 01:02:42.300]  But, uh... Why did he get away with that?
[01:02:42.841 --> 01:02:43.301]  What the...
[01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:44.931]  You didn't know about this?
[01:02:45.551 --> 01:02:46.332]  I don't remember this.
[01:02:46.352 --> 01:02:48.834]  Scroll down, and you'll see him zeigheiling.
[01:02:51.055 --> 01:02:51.796]  Oh my god.
[01:02:54.378 --> 01:02:56.159]  Look, everyone's laughing and enjoying it.
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:57.440]  Even the legs look Jewish.
[01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:59.562]  Like, that's a Jewish way to have your legs, I feel.
[01:03:00.663 --> 01:03:01.644]  Jewish leg stance.
[01:03:01.824 --> 01:03:01.924]  Oh!
[01:03:02.384 --> 01:03:04.726]  Jewish leg stance are playing at Mercury Lounge if you want to go.
[01:03:04.786 --> 01:03:05.306]  I gotta stick it.
[01:03:05.467 --> 01:03:06.107]  I know the bassist.
[01:03:07.588 --> 01:03:08.529]  They have a lot of good songs.
[01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:15.353]   Also, in the news, This Scottish guy... Oh, wait, wait, whoa.
[01:03:15.733 --> 01:03:15.953]  Uh-oh.
[01:03:15.973 --> 01:03:19.237]  He responded in 2014, back when this happened.
[01:03:20.278 --> 01:03:22.300]  A fake witch's nose, wig, and a beard.
[01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:23.261]  Random costume.
[01:03:23.301 --> 01:03:24.502]  Not my idea of a stereotype.
[01:03:24.522 --> 01:03:25.623]  Yeah, sure, buddy.
[01:03:26.564 --> 01:03:30.128]  Well, it coincidentally looked a lot like... Oh, jeez.
[01:03:31.089 --> 01:03:31.249]  Yeah.
[01:03:31.569 --> 01:03:32.150]  Nice one, Ryan.
[01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:32.891]  I'm sorry.
[01:03:34.402 --> 01:03:44.470]  Um, so during my interview with Ye, I said I wanted to give examples of ethno-masochistic Western nations that have zero to do with Judaism and Jews and Jews in the media.
[01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:45.931]  And a great example of that is Scotland.
[01:03:46.711 --> 01:03:48.513]  And it blew up in Scotland.
[01:03:48.753 --> 01:03:51.295]  I think Scotland is, they're sort of like Canada.
[01:03:51.875 --> 01:03:54.097]  They're near a big country that everyone talks about.
[01:03:54.117 --> 01:03:56.038]  And when someone talks about them, they go, hear you!
[01:03:56.699 --> 01:03:57.960]  Someone's talking about me!
[01:03:58.669 --> 01:03:59.590]  What have you got to say?
[01:03:59.610 --> 01:04:01.231]  I gotta say you're woke.
[01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:02.152]  Say you?
[01:04:02.352 --> 01:04:03.193]  I'll bar you!
[01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:05.234]  I'll give you the Glasgow kiss!
[01:04:05.654 --> 01:04:07.015]  I'll give you the Glasgow smile!
[01:04:07.035 --> 01:04:14.061]  Of course Glasgow kiss is headbutting someone and the Glasgow smile is when you take a razor and you cut the sides of their mouth.
[01:04:14.935 --> 01:04:27.084]  Which is why, as a kid who went to Glasgow every year, my parents are Glaswegian, we'd go every summer, uh, I saw the movie The Joker and he's like, heh heh heh, uh, my dad wanted me to smile, so he cut my mouth on either side!
[01:04:27.564 --> 01:04:29.625]  And then everyone in the audience is like, whoa!
[01:04:30.326 --> 01:04:32.988]  And I'm just going, yeah, that's a bad Friday night in Glasgow.
[01:04:33.628 --> 01:04:41.353]  It's not, it's not the grounds for a supervillain, heh heh heh, it's the grounds for a trip to the, the Hosspelt to get stu- stop!
[01:04:41.874 --> 01:04:43.415]  You know what they also do in Glasgow, by the way?
[01:04:44.318 --> 01:04:45.859]  They'll take a carpet cutter, right?
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:47.441]  They'll put two blades in it.
[01:04:47.861 --> 01:04:52.285]  Then they put a matchstick or like a, not a wood one, a little paper matches.
[01:04:52.585 --> 01:04:54.507]  They'll put that in between the two blades.
[01:04:55.107 --> 01:04:55.347]  What?
[01:04:56.068 --> 01:04:57.169]  Then they cut your face.
[01:04:57.809 --> 01:04:58.890]  There's a name for that, too.
[01:04:58.970 --> 01:05:01.332]  It's like an 84 or something because it needs 84 stitches.
[01:05:02.053 --> 01:05:05.456]  They'll cut your face, but it's two lines.
[01:05:05.876 --> 01:05:08.398]  So the middle part hangs out down like a piece of spaghetti.
[01:05:08.839 --> 01:05:12.462]  And it gives you like a really, really bad scar, like a cesarean scar.
[01:05:14.395 --> 01:05:16.177]  How sadistic can you get?
[01:05:16.637 --> 01:05:25.784]  Like, you hear these stories about the Rhodesian white farmers and the farmers in Zimbabwe getting attacked and you're horrified by the sadism, but go to Glasgow!
[01:05:26.305 --> 01:05:26.945]  We got it there too.
[01:05:27.185 --> 01:05:33.411]  But anyway, here's a little piece on some guy talking about what I said about Scotland and conceding that I'm right.
[01:05:34.932 --> 01:05:36.233]  They're proud to be woke, by the way.
[01:05:36.713 --> 01:05:38.274]  Good, we're angering the right people!
[01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:41.857]  I'm glad that we scouse us mad!
[01:05:42.458 --> 01:05:43.699]  What's he know about Glasgow?
[01:05:44.386 --> 01:05:46.187]  Dude, I could not know more about Glasgow.
[01:05:47.128 --> 01:05:48.809]  I know it more than Glaswegians do.
[01:05:49.509 --> 01:05:53.311]  And as my dad said, best thing about Glasgow, you never get homesick.
[01:05:55.913 --> 01:06:06.919]  One time we were on vacation in Jamaica and my dad was at the bar, as he's wont to do, and he goes, Scottish people are ugly, stupid and violent.
[01:06:07.762 --> 01:06:09.983]  And some Scottish woman overheard him.
[01:06:10.444 --> 01:06:11.825]  And she goes, see you, you prick!
[01:06:12.145 --> 01:06:12.945]  I'll batter you!
[01:06:13.165 --> 01:06:13.846]  I'll batter you.
[01:06:14.186 --> 01:06:15.447]  I'll batter you so I will.
[01:06:16.547 --> 01:06:17.768]  And my dad goes, see?
[01:06:17.788 --> 01:06:20.790]  Because she was ugly, stupid and violent.
[01:06:21.250 --> 01:06:27.874]  And then, of course, what happened, as with all Scots, they started doing shots together and they became best friends.
[01:06:30.075 --> 01:06:32.417]  And they were arm in arm singing.
[01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:35.262]  All flow out of Scotland!
[01:06:35.723 --> 01:06:37.024]  Why aren't you going to the clip?
[01:06:37.044 --> 01:06:37.244]  2-3.
[01:06:37.284 --> 01:06:39.386]  Come on, yay?
[01:06:40.448 --> 01:06:42.590]  This might be too long to play on InfoWars, but we'll see.
[01:06:44.102 --> 01:06:46.284]  I better not have gone to a commercial break and not known about it.
[01:06:46.304 --> 01:06:46.564]  Scotland.
[01:06:46.443 --> 01:06:51.523]   last night. They had Ye on and Nick Fuentes. Never mind what's going on with Ye, never
[01:06:51.523 --> 01:06:56.123]   mind what's going on with Nick Fuentes, the clip I'm about to show is regarding Scotland.
[01:06:56.123 --> 01:06:59.683]   And it's nice to finally hear someone with a bit of status saying exactly how Scotland
[01:06:59.683 --> 01:07:04.364]   is. An outsider. Because what these independence people don't realise is, Scotland's a laughing
[01:07:04.364 --> 01:07:07.643]   stock around the world. So I'll play the clip right now and then I'm going to talk about
[01:07:07.643 --> 01:07:08.643]  it.
[01:07:08.643 --> 01:07:14.244]  Scotland. Scotland is the most woke country in the world.
[01:07:14.244 --> 01:07:18.043]   It hates itself, they bring in. They have open border policies.
[01:07:18.044 --> 01:07:19.465]  The thing is, there's a lot of people who do know this.
[01:07:19.825 --> 01:07:21.606]  They're just not speaking out about it.
[01:07:21.446 --> 01:07:28.086]   the most woke DAs. They don't have DAs, but you get like Berkeley and Portland times a
[01:07:28.086 --> 01:07:32.486]   thousand. So as you can hear at least one American is well aware of what's going on
[01:07:32.486 --> 01:07:36.446]   in the situation in our country. The thing is there's a lot of people do know this. They're
[01:07:36.446 --> 01:07:39.285]  just not speaking out about it. So let's dissect the clip.
[01:07:39.285 --> 01:07:40.285]  Scotland.
[01:07:40.378 --> 01:07:43.679]  Scotland is the most woke country in the world.
[01:07:44.059 --> 01:07:44.619]  Absolutely.
[01:07:44.819 --> 01:07:47.620]  Wokeness has utterly ravaged the country.
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.780]  Where you're now afraid to speak.
[01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:53.281]  You don't know what you can and can't say now because everything can be taken as a hate crime.
[01:07:53.321 --> 01:07:54.321]  Doesn't matter what it is.
[01:07:54.821 --> 01:07:55.862]  Somebody classes it as hate speech.
[01:07:55.882 --> 01:07:56.602]  Someone says it's a commercial?
[01:07:56.622 --> 01:07:57.802]  They must investigate it.
[01:07:57.862 --> 01:08:01.683]  There's a lot of money being wasted investigating these, quote, hate crimes.
[01:08:01.943 --> 01:08:09.465]   A nation known for the greatest freedom fighting force the world has ever seen succumbed to being attacked by Let's sell some pharmaceuticals.
[01:08:12.907 --> 01:08:13.907]  Go away.
[01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:22.012]  Well, I don't know what will happen now.
[01:08:23.442 --> 01:08:29.648]  We've got some difficult days ahead, but I'm not concerned about that now.
[01:08:29.748 --> 01:08:31.570]  I just want to do God's will.
[01:08:32.391 --> 01:08:36.135]  And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain.
[01:08:37.176 --> 01:08:44.176]  I've looked over and I've seen the promised land.
[01:08:44.176 --> 01:08:55.176]   I may not get there with you, but I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised land.
[01:08:55.176 --> 01:08:57.176]  We've got to come together.
[01:08:57.176 --> 01:09:02.176]   Whether you believe it or not, you've got to decide whether you have dominion over yourself.
[01:09:02.601 --> 01:09:15.755]  I believe that the majority of the plain people of the United States will, day in and day out, make fewer mistakes in governing themselves than any smaller class or body of men, no matter what their training, will make in trying to govern.
[01:09:16.431 --> 01:09:25.699]  And you gotta decide whether it's God that's gonna have dominion over you, that you get orders from, or whether some other human that's jacked into the evil force is gonna have dominion over you.
[01:09:26.179 --> 01:09:36.909]  What we're talking about now is like a second industrial revolution, but the product this time will not be textiles or machines or vehicles or even weapons.
[01:09:37.229 --> 01:09:40.492]  The product this time will be humans themselves.
[01:09:40.532 --> 01:09:42.714]  Do we want to have a human plan or a post-human plan?
[01:09:43.314 --> 01:09:49.896]  Noval Harari and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates say humans are obsolete, we're scum, because they know we are their competition.
[01:09:50.217 --> 01:09:56.119]  They know that if we go for what we want and what God wants to have, they can't compete with that transmission.
[01:09:56.479 --> 01:09:57.899]  They can't compete with that blueprint.
[01:09:58.139 --> 01:09:59.660]  They can't compete with that architecture.
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:02.341]  They can't compete with that master plan.
[01:10:02.921 --> 01:10:03.902]  But I just see it now.
[01:10:04.402 --> 01:10:05.542]  It'll be so clear soon.
[01:10:06.003 --> 01:10:07.783]  Are you pro-human or are you anti-human?
[01:10:08.184 --> 01:10:11.285]  You are the human resistance to this alien takeover.
[01:10:11.685 --> 01:10:18.969]  And again, when I say alien takeover, I don't mean some little tinfoil flying saucer crashing in Roswell from Alpha Centauri.
[01:10:19.509 --> 01:10:25.252]  I'm talking about the transmission in the universe of God's order and God's will.
[01:10:25.352 --> 01:10:29.314]  Or do you choose to serve the agents of death?
[01:10:30.194 --> 01:10:33.016]  And like Martin Luther King said, we're not going to judge them off what color they are.
[01:10:33.036 --> 01:10:38.178]  We're going to judge them off of the character of their actions and deeds.
[01:10:38.879 --> 01:10:40.820]  So I'm going to say it right now, real clear.
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:44.682]  I love everybody, no matter what color your beautiful skin is.
[01:10:45.242 --> 01:10:47.743]  But I care about your heart and your guts and your mind.
[01:10:48.244 --> 01:10:50.065]  And you're under attack by these Satanists.
[01:10:50.245 --> 01:10:51.405]  And they want to kill you!
[01:10:51.425 --> 01:10:53.126]  And they want to kill your children!
[01:10:53.526 --> 01:10:55.788]  And I say we set our differences aside.
[01:10:56.508 --> 01:11:05.975]  And I say we come together and we beat these people and we smash their technocracy and we build the future together and we can do anything with our real diversity.
[01:11:06.635 --> 01:11:08.617]  These enemies tell us all day about diversity.
[01:11:08.897 --> 01:11:12.259]  They mean divided and conquered groups of people separate from each other.
[01:11:12.279 --> 01:11:13.840]  This bill is supported.
[01:11:15.089 --> 01:11:17.951]  By all of the Democrats, House and Senate.
[01:11:18.732 --> 01:11:20.753]  It's just a filibuster, in a way.
[01:11:21.634 --> 01:11:35.844]  So, in a way, if you really truly want to honor Dr. King, don't dishonor him by using a congressional custom as an excuse for protecting our democracy.
[01:11:36.184 --> 01:11:40.427]  If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.
[01:11:42.092 --> 01:11:42.413]  Unity.
[01:11:43.459 --> 01:11:45.028]  Under a code of freedom.
[01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:50.905]  And liberty, and justice, and coming together, and working together, and being strong.
[01:11:51.125 --> 01:12:00.213]  Alright folks, Gavin McGinnis has been hosting the show, and because I've got so much fires I'm putting out, so much behind-the-scenes things, and so many things going on, I had to go off over an hour ago.
[01:12:00.714 --> 01:12:07.019]  That's why I tell the listeners, free speech is in deep trouble, and InfoWars needs your support and your prayers, and so does all free speech out there.
[01:12:07.038 --> 01:12:11.358]   But you notice, right as the battle is getting the very most intense for all of us, the Twitter
[01:12:11.358 --> 01:12:15.318]   files are coming out and all the documentation is coming out and all the Hunter Biden stuff
[01:12:15.318 --> 01:12:18.679]   is coming out and the whole New World Order is being exposed.
[01:12:18.679 --> 01:12:23.318]   Gannon has really been kicking ass and I really appreciate my old friend coming on the broadcast
[01:12:23.318 --> 01:12:24.318]  here with us today.
[01:12:24.318 --> 01:12:29.318]   In between some of the fires I was put down, I was watching you.
[01:12:29.318 --> 01:12:30.318]  Truly hilarious.
[01:12:30.318 --> 01:12:35.778]   But all I know is they can't put down Ye for his comments he made.
[01:12:35.778 --> 01:12:41.238]   Even the ADL has come out and endorsed the Azov battalion that is the purest form of
[01:12:41.238 --> 01:12:44.438]  Nazism on the earth today.
[01:12:44.438 --> 01:12:49.198]   And so now we have the president of Ukraine endorsing the Azov battalion and now we have
[01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:55.998]   the head of the ADL endorsing the Azov battalion who actually hail Hitler and do blood rituals,
[01:12:55.998 --> 01:12:58.878]  blood and soil Hitler rituals.
[01:12:58.878 --> 01:13:00.559]  It's absolutely insane.
[01:13:00.559 --> 01:13:02.278]  What do you make of this bizarreness, Gavin?
[01:13:02.278 --> 01:13:12.277]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:13:03.757 --> 01:13:04.697]  Well, they're Bolsheviks.
[01:13:05.238 --> 01:13:07.318]  All Bolsheviks care about is winning.
[01:13:07.778 --> 01:13:13.360]  And that's why you'll see these sort of secular, non-religious Jews crapping on Israel.
[01:13:13.681 --> 01:13:17.242]  Because they don't really care about their fellow Jewish person.
[01:13:17.262 --> 01:13:19.763]  They don't really care about their fellow man.
[01:13:19.983 --> 01:13:21.183]  All they care about is winning.
[01:13:21.583 --> 01:13:33.367]   So when these liberals, these Bolshevik psychotic liberals, realized that they were funding Nazis who were Zieg Heiling, wearing Nazi regalia, they said, It's not a big deal.
[01:13:33.908 --> 01:13:34.628]  It's complicated.
[01:13:34.648 --> 01:13:37.109]  We had Jon Stewart giving a guy an award.
[01:13:37.349 --> 01:13:39.570]  He has a Nazi tattoo.
[01:13:40.010 --> 01:13:41.831]  And everyone's just like, well, put a bandage on it.
[01:13:41.891 --> 01:13:42.491]  We'll be fine.
[01:13:42.792 --> 01:13:44.692]  They don't have the courage of their convictions.
[01:13:44.953 --> 01:13:49.695]  And it makes them a tough adversary because it's like fighting a ghost.
[01:13:49.755 --> 01:13:51.655]  Like we are solid in what we believe.
[01:13:51.696 --> 01:13:52.736]  We believe in the family.
[01:13:52.976 --> 01:13:54.397]  We believe in Western culture.
[01:13:54.657 --> 01:13:56.258]  We believe in Jesus Christ.
[01:13:57.678 --> 01:13:59.440]  That's stalwart, that's set in stone.
[01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:02.582]  They're just moving all over the place, whatever it takes to win.
[01:14:02.963 --> 01:14:06.846]  Cheating on elections, supporting Nazis, whatever works, they do it.
[01:14:08.528 --> 01:14:09.148]  How do you fight them?
[01:14:10.649 --> 01:14:12.971]  You recognize who they are and everything they say is a lie.
[01:14:14.353 --> 01:14:14.533]  Yeah.
[01:14:15.226 --> 01:14:19.090]  And every time they're confronted with that lie, they just shrug and move on.
[01:14:19.770 --> 01:14:27.458]  I'm at the point now, and I was saying this to Ye, I think we need to, if not cheat on the next election, definitely ballot harvest.
[01:14:27.498 --> 01:14:32.022]  Like, I want their Dinesh D'Souza to be doing a 2000 Mules about us.
[01:14:32.622 --> 01:14:33.503]  We need to cheat!
[01:14:35.069 --> 01:14:36.409]  Or Joe Biden's gonna win!
[01:14:36.669 --> 01:14:39.470]  Well, that's what war is, is that the chivalry goes away.
[01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:45.491]  At a certain point, they're gonna force us, who are way more productive than them at cheating, and boy, then they're really in trouble.
[01:14:45.791 --> 01:14:47.812]  Then how do we not become them once we win?
[01:14:50.232 --> 01:14:50.832]  We are them.
[01:14:50.912 --> 01:14:51.653]  We become them.
[01:14:51.793 --> 01:14:58.674]  If you're fighting someone in the ring, and they kick you in the balls, and the ref doesn't do anything, it's time to start kicking in the balls.
[01:14:59.154 --> 01:14:59.894]  Sorry, that's the deal.
[01:14:59.914 --> 01:15:02.175]  I have to say, we are crossing that Rubicon right now.
[01:15:03.365 --> 01:15:03.925]  We really are!
[01:15:03.985 --> 01:15:09.226]  Like, Hasan Piker was showing my yay interview on Twitch and we had him taken down.
[01:15:09.547 --> 01:15:11.667]  And he goes, but you're a free speech absolutist.
[01:15:11.707 --> 01:15:13.407]  And I'm like, yeah, I'm a hypocrite too.
[01:15:13.627 --> 01:15:14.368]  I don't like you.
[01:15:14.508 --> 01:15:15.228]  You're banned.
[01:15:18.649 --> 01:15:20.649]  Yeah, what are they going to do when we finally take the gloves off?
[01:15:20.669 --> 01:15:24.710]  Because they've been using lead pipes and daggers and machine guns on us.
[01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:26.571]  We've been fighting them with big old gloves.
[01:15:26.591 --> 01:15:28.011]  What are they going to do when we take the gloves off?
[01:15:29.651 --> 01:15:32.455]  I mean, Proud Boys get four years for fighting Antifa.
[01:15:32.855 --> 01:15:39.023]  Antifa gets probation for throwing a flaming Molotov cocktail into a police car.
[01:15:39.623 --> 01:15:41.726]  No jail time whatsoever for that.
[01:15:42.589 --> 01:15:45.731]  So it's not just, like, liberals and radical lefties.
[01:15:46.171 --> 01:15:53.254]  The judges, the prosecutors, the media, like, they own everything, and then they pretend that they're anti-establishment.
[01:15:53.634 --> 01:15:56.296]  So I don't know, how do we go against these judges?
[01:15:56.356 --> 01:16:03.679]  Like, they're getting judged today on Jan 6th, my buddy Nick Ox, Proud Boy, he's looking at 20 years for meandering.
[01:16:04.259 --> 01:16:05.160]  That's happening right now.
[01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:06.461]  That's right.
[01:16:06.621 --> 01:16:08.702]  Walking around the Capitol in the police line in 20 years.
[01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:12.141]  Some people broke the windows.
[01:16:12.241 --> 01:16:15.942]  That should be, I don't know, some probation and a thousand dollar fine.
[01:16:15.982 --> 01:16:16.943]  They didn't hurt anyone.
[01:16:16.963 --> 01:16:22.105]  But if he was the vice president bailing out people that firebomb federal buildings, he'd be fine.
[01:16:23.526 --> 01:16:23.766]  Yes.
[01:16:24.286 --> 01:16:26.627]  And the Capitol has been invaded a million times.
[01:16:26.707 --> 01:16:27.848]  Look up the Black Panthers.
[01:16:28.128 --> 01:16:32.290]  They brought guns and stood on the steps and everyone liked it because they had cool outfits on.
[01:16:32.310 --> 01:16:33.470]  Democrats have bombed the U.S.
[01:16:33.490 --> 01:16:34.651]  Capitol three times I know of.
[01:16:36.141 --> 01:16:36.381]  Yeah.
[01:16:36.981 --> 01:16:43.723]  Of course, the British that we worship, and I don't think it's the British, I've got a British background like you do and other people, but I mean, the British blew the U.S.
[01:16:43.763 --> 01:16:45.183]  Capitol up with cannons, remember that?
[01:16:46.223 --> 01:16:46.443]  Yep.
[01:16:47.223 --> 01:16:49.424]  Yeah, remember, was it Andrew Jackson?
[01:16:49.804 --> 01:17:03.147]  It was around 1812 when the people of D.C., they said, this is our building, and they just went in, and there was some law where you're not allowed to kick them out, so they had to lure them out after three days with free beer, and they eventually got them out.
[01:17:04.983 --> 01:17:10.004]  So the point is that they call this the biggest event ever, January 6th, that's a joke.
[01:17:11.665 --> 01:17:21.828]  The worst thing that's happened to America since 9-11, and they've also said, I think Mitch McConnell said, it's the worst invasion of our own democracy since the Civil War.
[01:17:22.148 --> 01:17:22.408]  What?
[01:17:22.768 --> 01:17:24.988]  Schumer said worse than 9-11, as bad as Pearl Harbor.
[01:17:28.991 --> 01:17:38.416]  After two years of writing, as Joe Big says, and we're fundraising for him on censored.tv, we're selling my show notes for $25 each to go to his trial.
[01:17:39.296 --> 01:17:47.420]  He said, they have a hundred riots a year, we have one riot every hundred years, and our punishment is a hundred times worse.
[01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:48.820]  Who can't see that?
[01:17:49.161 --> 01:17:53.463]  Like, do these people honestly believe that this Jan 6 was a big deal?
[01:17:53.803 --> 01:17:54.043]  How?
[01:17:55.956 --> 01:18:02.240]  I want to come back and talk to you about the big picture and some of the other issues with Gavin McGinnis, and then we'll open the phones up and cover a ton of news after he leaves us.
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:05.242]  Gavin is always on fire about his great work.
[01:18:05.662 --> 01:18:06.763]  We'll tell you about it when we come back.
[01:18:07.624 --> 01:18:09.585]  Final segment with the great Gavin McGinnis.
[01:18:10.025 --> 01:18:14.528]  Gavin, you've got a couple great websites, but what's the best place for people to find all the great work you do?
[01:18:16.089 --> 01:18:17.710]  Censored.tv.
[01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:22.653]  I'm on Getter and Telegram and Gab and all that, but it all comes from Censored.tv.
[01:18:24.247 --> 01:18:25.608]  All right, I said, what do you want to hit next?
[01:18:25.668 --> 01:18:28.729]  And I actually had this right here in the next part of my stack.
[01:18:29.489 --> 01:18:35.551]  Felony warrant issued for non-binary Biden official Sam Brenton after second luggage stealing incident.
[01:18:35.912 --> 01:18:43.414]  So this is the guy in charge of the nuclear spent fuel stockpile, incredibly deadly and dangerous, who looks like a space alien.
[01:18:43.655 --> 01:18:46.282]   So he's not only It's like Blair White.
[01:18:46.322 --> 01:18:50.045]  If you're a dude that feels like you're a woman and wants to be a woman, at least look like a woman.
[01:18:50.485 --> 01:18:52.947]  I don't hate anybody for wanting to be a woman or a man or whatever.
[01:18:52.967 --> 01:18:55.189]  I mean, I'm a libertarian when it comes to that.
[01:18:55.509 --> 01:18:59.772]  But stay away from kids and stay away from the nuclear stockpile and stay away from people's luggage.
[01:18:59.852 --> 01:19:06.638]  And we just have this, you know, we have this other trainee that's the head of, deputy head of Health and Human Services that says she's an admiral.
[01:19:07.118 --> 01:19:09.440]  And it just gets more clownish by the day.
[01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:13.363]  Meanwhile, this dude is running around identifying other people's luggage as his.
[01:19:14.764 --> 01:19:17.767]  Yeah, he's, look, most trans are just mentally ill gays.
[01:19:17.847 --> 01:19:19.968]  The ones in college are just pretending to be gay.
[01:19:20.329 --> 01:19:24.232]  But when they get to that age, with the mustache and the bald head, they're mentally ill.
[01:19:24.772 --> 01:19:29.176]  And when you affirmative action hire someone, the odds of them not being good for the job are pretty high.
[01:19:29.536 --> 01:19:35.641]  When you affirmative action hire a middle-aged tranny, then the odds of him being nuts are incredibly high.
[01:19:35.701 --> 01:19:37.923]  And this guy's clearly a sociopath.
[01:19:38.223 --> 01:19:44.569]  You're not a kleptomaniac if you steal luggage more than once, knowing you're going to get caught, knowing all eyes are on you.
[01:19:44.609 --> 01:19:47.872]  He was facing a felony for the first one and then he did it again.
[01:19:48.012 --> 01:19:48.492]  You know why?
[01:19:48.512 --> 01:19:51.955]  Because he's absolutely insane.
[01:19:52.395 --> 01:19:59.962]  I think a lot of trainees, they don't just want to be women, they want to like wear women's panties and like step into a woman's skin like Silence of the Lambs.
[01:20:00.342 --> 01:20:17.038]   I think this guy stealing luggage And getting their clothes and holding their clothes and their underwear is an example of an absolute deranged possibly a murderer who is in a high position of power because we're bending over backwards to be woke.
[01:20:17.419 --> 01:20:27.788]   Well I would say if you do like the FBI criminology thing on this you would say The house needs to be searched.
[01:20:27.828 --> 01:20:28.789]  We have probable cause.
[01:20:29.170 --> 01:20:30.211]  Who knows what's in the home?
[01:20:30.811 --> 01:20:38.239]  Because, literally, imagine foreign governments, how easy it is to infiltrate people like this who are completely kleptocratic already.
[01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:40.541]  Yeah, I didn't think of that.
[01:20:40.801 --> 01:20:49.786]  This is like when, you know, there's that one kid who like puts, uses knives to pin a frog to a tree and then he's throwing other knives at it and all the other kids are like, dude, what are you doing?
[01:20:50.267 --> 01:20:52.648]  This, he's that level of sociopathic.
[01:20:52.948 --> 01:20:54.109]  You already got caught for this.
[01:20:54.289 --> 01:20:55.350]  You had a terrible excuse.
[01:20:55.410 --> 01:20:56.971]  We saw you rip off the ID tag.
[01:20:57.331 --> 01:20:58.111]  All eyes are on you.
[01:20:58.151 --> 01:20:58.672]  And what do you do?
[01:20:58.692 --> 01:21:00.213]  I did it again.
[01:21:00.233 --> 01:21:02.394]  I need the pantyhose.
[01:21:02.874 --> 01:21:04.135]  I'm a psycho.
[01:21:04.155 --> 01:21:04.215]  Wow.
[01:21:06.176 --> 01:21:08.958]  We really know how to pick them, don't we?
[01:21:09.775 --> 01:21:17.711]  Well, they even knew in Hollywood 25 years ago in Silence of the Lambs or 30 that the psycho dude thinks he's a woman and makes her rub the lotion on her skin.
[01:21:19.272 --> 01:21:23.397]  Yeah, and people need to understand the psychosis of a lot of these drag queen trannies.
[01:21:23.737 --> 01:21:25.339]  Actually, not drag queens, they're just silly clowns.
[01:21:25.419 --> 01:21:30.084]  But the trannies, they don't necessarily want to be a woman, they want to be inside of a woman.
[01:21:30.445 --> 01:21:35.571]  Like, the most subtle version would be smelling used panties, that's like step one.
[01:21:35.991 --> 01:21:42.257]   Step 50 is putting on the nylons, putting on the lipstick and going, I'm in a lady's skin.
[01:21:42.698 --> 01:21:45.800]  I'm going to steal all their luggage.
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:47.762]  I'm going to wear their underwear on my head.
[01:21:48.142 --> 01:21:48.662]  I'm nuts.
[01:21:48.722 --> 01:21:49.983]  Give me the nuclear codes.
[01:21:51.224 --> 01:21:51.705]  Exactly.
[01:21:51.765 --> 01:21:52.825]  So that was my next question.
[01:21:53.206 --> 01:21:58.830]  Why would the establishment prize these people and try to put them in the most dangerous, powerful positions?
[01:22:00.228 --> 01:22:02.628]  Well, there's two scenarios and they both suck.
[01:22:03.189 --> 01:22:05.029]  One is, they want us all to die.
[01:22:05.709 --> 01:22:14.251]  And two is, they're so inept that they happily promote and put in positions of power absolute mental patients.
[01:22:14.671 --> 01:22:15.611]  I don't like either of those.
[01:22:15.751 --> 01:22:16.031]  Do you?
[01:22:16.051 --> 01:22:17.311]  I don't.
[01:22:17.411 --> 01:22:21.332]  Where does the whole yay situation go?
[01:22:23.233 --> 01:22:24.353]  From here on in?
[01:22:24.973 --> 01:22:25.133]  Yes.
[01:22:26.466 --> 01:22:26.906]  I don't know.
[01:22:27.026 --> 01:22:30.649]  I think the Jewish community handled it really bad.
[01:22:31.129 --> 01:22:39.233]  If someone says something silly about your group, which they say about Christians and white males and cis white males, on a minutely basis we're getting bombarded.
[01:22:39.494 --> 01:22:39.914]  What do we do?
[01:22:39.954 --> 01:22:41.835]  We go, yeah, I know, I'm evil.
[01:22:41.895 --> 01:22:43.556]  Oh, that killed all the Indians.
[01:22:43.636 --> 01:22:44.777]  Slavery built America.
[01:22:44.837 --> 01:22:45.977]  Sorry, I'm the bad guy.
[01:22:46.358 --> 01:22:47.018]  That's what you do.
[01:22:47.498 --> 01:22:53.117]   But to debank him, freeze $400 million, You're justifying everything he said.
[01:22:53.137 --> 01:22:58.640]  Like, if I was Jewish, I'd be saying to the ADL and the banks that froze his account, I'd be like, guys, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:00.240]  This is really bad for you.
[01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:00.521]  That's right.
[01:23:00.541 --> 01:23:08.304]  When Ethan Klein, who has a big show, said, I want to kill Christians, I want to kill Jesus, I want to murder him, we went, he's being shocking, we don't blame Jews for that.
[01:23:08.584 --> 01:23:09.945]  Though he said, us Jews want to do it.
[01:23:10.205 --> 01:23:11.226]  He was provocateuring.
[01:23:11.546 --> 01:23:13.086]  He's just being a clown.
[01:23:13.447 --> 01:23:15.307]  When Ye does it, oh my God, it's so serious.
[01:23:15.588 --> 01:23:26.995]   And the head of the ADL, who calls me the most evil man in the world, He went on Charlemagne the God's show and said exactly what Ye's claiming they're doing to him, which they've done.
[01:23:26.836 --> 01:23:27.836]  Here it is.
[01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:28.836]  [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[01:23:28.836 --> 01:23:30.275]  --somebody like Kanye, right?
[01:23:30.275 --> 01:23:36.155]   Because Kanye says, hey, Jewish people have all the power, and then he loses everything.
[01:23:36.155 --> 01:23:46.034]   Well, look, the insidious nature of anti-Semitism and these tropes about power is--
[01:23:46.073 --> 01:23:55.840]  Kanye can say these things, Jews have all the power, they're controlling everything, and if we don't get him, if we don't deal with that, the myth spreads and it takes root.
[01:23:57.101 --> 01:24:02.806]  So if we don't... Ye says we have power, we can shut people down, so if we don't shut him down, the myth will spread.
[01:24:03.166 --> 01:24:06.669]  That is the most counterintuitive, oxymoronic statement I've ever heard.
[01:24:07.907 --> 01:24:10.969]  It's that you just gave the myth credibility, you moron.
[01:24:11.389 --> 01:24:20.196]  You know, at my boxing gym, there's a lot of black dudes and Ye's beliefs are not considered radical amongst the sort of working class black community.
[01:24:20.696 --> 01:24:24.338]  And the fact that he they don't even they don't even question what he said.
[01:24:24.379 --> 01:24:27.521]  They go, yo, yo, yo, boy, Ye's going to end up in a box.
[01:24:28.141 --> 01:24:35.503]  No, exactly, because black folks have always been disproportionately a large part of our audience, because they get we're fighting the system, and I love black folks that tune in.
[01:24:36.683 --> 01:24:39.464]  I've only gotten some of the negative feedback, even questioning what Ye said.
[01:24:39.804 --> 01:24:45.865]  Not that I don't dislike the ADL or Hollywood of the Left and their control, and that there is a Jewish mafia that's a big part of it.
[01:24:45.965 --> 01:24:48.066]  I admit all that, but it's not just all Jews.
[01:24:48.466 --> 01:24:53.107]  I'm saying Hitler was a crazy dude that started a giant war and did a bunch of bad stuff.
[01:24:53.447 --> 01:24:55.808]  So I'm not going to endorse Hitler, so I don't agree with Ye.
[01:24:57.068 --> 01:25:05.231]  If you go to even Twitter or Facebook, most people agree with Ye, so I think if the ADL is trying to create anti-Semitism to get more donations, they've done a great job.
[01:25:06.792 --> 01:25:09.353]  Yeah, you want to deal with Ye's ideas?
[01:25:09.773 --> 01:25:10.574]  Debate him.
[01:25:10.734 --> 01:25:11.394]  Talk to him.
[01:25:11.894 --> 01:25:13.615]  Or debate an anti-Semite.
[01:25:13.675 --> 01:25:15.736]  That's what we need, the free marketplace of ideas.
[01:25:15.796 --> 01:25:17.176]  That's how ideas thrive.
[01:25:17.417 --> 01:25:18.357]  That's how truth thrives.
[01:25:18.377 --> 01:25:23.079]  And by the way, since Nick Fuentes, and maybe I missed the boat, but Nick says a lot of good things I agree with.
[01:25:23.119 --> 01:25:24.219]  I like Nick, smart guy.
[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:25.260]  He told me he...
[01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:28.081]  He was just for white people and didn't like us being bullied.
[01:25:28.101 --> 01:25:28.662]  Well, I agree with that.
[01:25:29.022 --> 01:25:30.483]  He came out and said he likes Hitler too.
[01:25:31.003 --> 01:25:33.624]  I said I'd like to debate him and Ye in a friendly debate.
[01:25:33.884 --> 01:25:35.145]  Maybe you should come to Austin.
[01:25:35.825 --> 01:25:36.506]  I'll fly you here.
[01:25:36.546 --> 01:25:38.086]  We should all have a big discussion.
[01:25:38.106 --> 01:25:48.512]  But I think that debate with Gavin McGinnis, Nick Fuentes, Ye, and Alex Jones would break the internet even bigger than the last interview last week that they say is the biggest thing ever.
[01:25:50.014 --> 01:25:51.015]  Could I do first class?
[01:25:52.818 --> 01:25:54.841]  I'm bankrupt, so no.
[01:25:54.901 --> 01:25:59.867]  We're probably going to fly you here in like a little Cessna with an engine halfway going up.
[01:26:01.329 --> 01:26:02.671]  I'll get the short bus.
[01:26:02.691 --> 01:26:05.695]  A little yellow school bus will pull up in front of my house and I'll do a 16-hour drive.
[01:26:05.755 --> 01:26:07.658]  I'll tell you what, if you'll hitchhike here, we'll get you on air.
[01:26:10.325 --> 01:26:11.585]  No, no, seriously.
[01:26:11.625 --> 01:26:16.586]  I mean, look, and I've called Nick, and he's like, yeah, yeah, we'll do the debate.
[01:26:17.127 --> 01:26:18.247]  But they've been silent since then.
[01:26:18.267 --> 01:26:21.568]  But I really think that debate would be amazing.
[01:26:21.908 --> 01:26:28.849]  Or I might rent a movie theater and, like, actually play him Hitler clips and then ask him, do you agree with that?
[01:26:28.949 --> 01:26:32.270]  Because, I mean, look, we don't think he hates polls, right?
[01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:33.901]  What do the polls do?
[01:26:34.141 --> 01:26:41.969]  Hitler, like, just suddenly attacked Poland and firebombed all their major cities in two weeks and took them over and killed, like, a million people in two weeks.
[01:26:42.049 --> 01:26:43.691]  I mean, do the polls deserve that?
[01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:47.762]  He killed Germans, he killed clowns, he killed artists.
[01:26:47.862 --> 01:26:50.824]  I mean, he was a mass murderer.
[01:26:51.184 --> 01:26:52.766]  It's hard to justify Hitler.
[01:26:53.706 --> 01:26:54.066]  Exactly!
[01:26:54.106 --> 01:26:57.609]  He launched a war against Poland and blew it to the ground.
[01:26:57.669 --> 01:27:00.051]  So now do the Poles deserve this?
[01:27:00.091 --> 01:27:02.833]  I mean, I'm using the Poles because that's when he really started World War II.
[01:27:03.233 --> 01:27:10.218]  I mean, he just literally, brutally, with the biggest military on Earth at the time, blew the living hell out of the Poles for no reason.
[01:27:11.485 --> 01:27:14.506]  But look at Western civilization was built on bravery.
[01:27:14.726 --> 01:27:16.826]  It was built on grit and strength.
[01:27:17.166 --> 01:27:19.327]  That's how we built the greatest civilization on Earth.
[01:27:19.647 --> 01:27:21.347]  And now we're scared of ideas?
[01:27:21.988 --> 01:27:23.488]  I can handle any idea.
[01:27:23.768 --> 01:27:25.308]  I can debate a pedophile.
[01:27:25.609 --> 01:27:30.550]  I can debate the most unthinkable thoughts in the world because they're just thoughts.
[01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:34.571]  Why are we so scared of someone having a dangerous opinion?
[01:27:34.591 --> 01:27:35.491]  That's embarrassing.
[01:27:35.851 --> 01:27:40.514]  That's not to the kind of nation that destroys Britain and becomes independent in 1776.
[01:27:40.774 --> 01:27:43.376]  That's a weak nation.
[01:27:43.576 --> 01:27:44.757]  I totally agree.
[01:27:44.877 --> 01:27:48.979]  Endorsing Hitler, it shows how much the left is hated.
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:50.961]  So I would agree, the left is the modern Hitler.
[01:27:51.281 --> 01:27:53.542]  So people think, well, Hitler was against them, he must be good.
[01:27:53.642 --> 01:27:54.663]  No, both bad.
[01:27:55.043 --> 01:27:56.364]  Gavin McGinnis, incredible hour.
[01:27:56.404 --> 01:27:57.285]  Thank you so much, brother.
[01:27:58.319 --> 01:27:58.999]  Thanks for having me, man.
[01:27:59.500 --> 01:27:59.920]  Thank you.
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:02.802]  I'm just gonna ask you, like, what did the Poles do to Germany?
[01:28:02.862 --> 01:28:04.623]  They had horseback troops, okay?
[01:28:05.404 --> 01:28:06.525]  It was wrong, okay?
[01:28:10.928 --> 01:28:12.129]  It's insane!
[01:28:12.149 --> 01:28:14.830]  Oh my goodness!
[01:28:16.452 --> 01:28:17.953]  Alright, folks, we're gonna come right back.
[01:28:19.874 --> 01:28:26.579]  But the Russians did fight and killed 19 of the 22 million Germans that died.
[01:28:27.411 --> 01:28:40.490]   Hitler did not do a very good job It's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live on
[01:28:40.490 --> 01:28:48.386]   air broadcasting free worldwide And it seems quite real that things can change in an instant.
[01:28:49.813 --> 01:28:56.355]  Things are getting very weird, and it's definitely more difficult than ever to even know what's going on.
[01:28:56.855 --> 01:29:00.097]  But we'll keep doing our best, so long as you keep us on the air.
[01:29:00.917 --> 01:29:04.418]  And you can do that now at InfoWarStore.com.

[01:29:22.146 --> 01:29:23.888]  We thank you for your support.

[01:29:28.408 --> 01:29:37.208]  [MUSIC]
[01:29:37.208 --> 01:29:41.408]   They came out on ABC News and said, now you got to take six COVID shots a year.
[01:29:41.581 --> 01:29:49.768]  The new Pfizer booster is cleared for anyone over 12 and Moderna's for anyone over 18 and two months out from their last shot.
[01:29:50.328 --> 01:29:53.130]  How do we say six COVID shots two and a half years ago?
[01:29:53.210 --> 01:29:59.335]  Because Bill Gates said to his investors that this shot gets rid of your immune system and people have to take six of them to eight of them a year.
[01:29:59.475 --> 01:30:01.637]  So when I tell you this stuff, understand it's real.
[01:30:01.817 --> 01:30:07.000]  You know, being able within six months to make enough for the world, I think that should be our aspiration.
[01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:10.282]  Is it possible to prevent the next pandemic?
[01:30:10.342 --> 01:30:15.025]  Yes, if every country does what Australia did, then you wouldn't be calling it a pandemic.
[01:30:15.305 --> 01:30:23.731]  A lot of people want to forget the lockdowns, forget the masks, forget the checkpoints, forget all the garbage that's ongoing in places like China and New Zealand.
[01:30:23.871 --> 01:30:25.031]  You are a criminal!
[01:30:27.133 --> 01:30:27.733]  You are a criminal!
[01:30:27.813 --> 01:30:28.433]  And so are you!
[01:30:28.594 --> 01:30:29.134]  And so are you!
[01:30:29.454 --> 01:30:32.095]  You know, our baby has just been medically kidnapped.
[01:30:32.115 --> 01:30:44.102]  Thugs have come in wearing police uniforms and they will rip the baby out of his bed and violently taken him out of the room.
[01:30:45.242 --> 01:30:50.305]  They've threatened to arrest us all if we even pursue our baby.
[01:30:50.325 --> 01:31:03.468]   So, Let this be a lesson to the entire rest of humanity is the takeover has actually started and it started in a hospital ward with a baby.
[01:31:03.729 --> 01:31:08.071]  I call on humanity to arise.
[01:31:08.452 --> 01:31:10.813]  So we got to get ahead of this and keep discrediting it.
[01:31:11.113 --> 01:31:12.894]  If we don't, China is our future.
[01:31:12.954 --> 01:31:13.875]  So let's get into it.
[01:31:14.275 --> 01:31:22.760]   In Israel, the Ministry of Health in Israel is actively hiding critical information on the side effects It's quite known that Israel was Pfizer's laboratory.
[01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:26.982]  Pfizer's request to the FDA to approve the booster was to a great deal based on the Israeli data.
[01:31:26.802 --> 01:31:28.082]  and destroys immunity.
[01:31:28.082 --> 01:31:32.481]  It's quite known that Israel was Pfizer's laboratory.
[01:31:32.481 --> 01:31:40.802]   Pfizer's request to the FDA to approve the booster was to a great deal based on the Israeli data.
[01:31:40.802 --> 01:31:49.402]   But what the world did not know was that actually for the entire year in which almost the whole population
[01:31:49.402 --> 01:31:57.872]   was vaccinated, two or even three doses, Israel actually did not have any functional monitoring
[01:31:57.872 --> 01:31:58.042]  system.
[01:31:58.042 --> 01:32:02.602]  The monitoring was really dysfunctional.
[01:32:02.602 --> 01:32:04.402]  I have all this information.
[01:32:04.898 --> 01:32:07.219]  On my cell phone.
[01:32:07.539 --> 01:32:11.522]  Not just because I'm a minister, but because we have a centralized digital system.
[01:32:11.962 --> 01:32:15.124]  The Minister of Health, the whole time, just lied.
[01:32:15.264 --> 01:32:18.425]  Not just to the Israeli population, but also to the FDA.
[01:32:19.346 --> 01:32:23.708]  And many researchers actually were very, very concerned.
[01:32:23.728 --> 01:32:24.528]  In Germany.
[01:32:24.869 --> 01:32:43.505]   And so one of the aims of the Nuremberg trials was to spend 139 days In trial, going through the law and medical ethics and the public conscience, trying all these people against those benchmarks and finding them guilty or not guilty, depending on the evidence.
[01:32:44.506 --> 01:32:48.430]  But what came out of it was what the excuses were.
[01:32:48.450 --> 01:32:55.730]   And when you hear the nurses' excuses, It's all the same as what's being said today.
[01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:57.192]  I had a job.
[01:32:57.893 --> 01:33:00.055]  I had elderly relatives to look after.
[01:33:00.395 --> 01:33:01.476]  I was being bullied.
[01:33:01.937 --> 01:33:03.819]  Oh, it was a terrible environment at work.
[01:33:03.839 --> 01:33:06.542]  You know, you couldn't do anything to challenge any of the doctors.
[01:33:06.922 --> 01:33:08.905]  And we basically just did as we were told.
[01:33:09.605 --> 01:33:11.888]  Thinking, that meant that they were left off the hook.
[01:33:12.523 --> 01:33:16.345]  That's exactly the same narrative that's being promulgated today.
[01:33:16.585 --> 01:33:17.045]  In the UK.
[01:33:17.085 --> 01:33:29.911]  There have been more reported deaths and adverse reactions following mRNA vaccination in 18 months than there has been to every conventional vaccine administered worldwide for the last 50 years.
[01:33:31.011 --> 01:33:31.652]  In Canada.
[01:33:31.792 --> 01:33:40.379]  So the OAG report points to 13 million dollars of a certain million doses who would have been destroyed outside of Canada.
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:47.566]  So that was in large part due to AstraZeneca's doses which couldn't be used inside Canada.
[01:33:48.166 --> 01:33:57.735]  As of now there are approximately 10.8 million doses of vaccines of all sorts that were either destroyed or have expired in Canada.
[01:33:58.035 --> 01:33:58.817]  In the U.S.
[01:33:59.018 --> 01:34:05.412]  The bottom line here is the vaccine does not prevent infection, does not prevent transmission.
[01:34:06.488 --> 01:34:08.449]  So why would we make anybody take it?
[01:34:08.750 --> 01:34:13.853]  The pathway to preventing any more harm is all the vaccines need to be pulled off the market and withdrawn.
[01:34:14.453 --> 01:34:15.894]  That needs to happen immediately.
[01:34:16.415 --> 01:34:19.517]  All the vaccine mandates should be dropped immediately.
[01:34:20.077 --> 01:34:27.802]  Vitamin C. My hospital would not allow me to use vitamin C. We're talking about basic safe drugs.
[01:34:28.583 --> 01:34:29.964]  And it's an outrage.
[01:34:29.963 --> 01:34:33.403]  What they wanted me to use was Remdesivir.
[01:34:33.403 --> 01:34:44.963]   And it's time for humanity to stand up in the InfoWar and say, "I don't know what's
[01:34:44.963 --> 01:34:47.443]  going to happen at the end of this, but you ought to fight!"
[01:34:47.671 --> 01:34:49.352]  You better believe you got one!
[01:34:49.192 --> 01:34:56.192]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:34:56.192 --> 01:35:21.192]  [Music]
[01:35:21.192 --> 01:35:32.192]   Alright, a lot of listeners probably noticed that about 30 minutes into the show I disappeared for an hour.
[01:35:33.027 --> 01:35:36.668]  And we have a lot of enemies that hate this country and hate you that are watching right now.
[01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:39.500]  So I'm going to address them.
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:44.603]  I'm going to address the listeners and viewers of this show that care about America and the world, their children and freedom.
[01:35:47.345 --> 01:35:50.227]  Everything I've ever done on air has been truthful.
[01:35:51.727 --> 01:35:53.148]  Everything I've ever said, I really meant.
[01:35:54.729 --> 01:35:57.971]  Everything I've ever broken down is what I really believe was happening.
[01:35:59.552 --> 01:36:03.014]  And this broadcast has changed the world more than any other broadcast in modern history.
[01:36:03.694 --> 01:36:08.397]  Not just because of myself and our guests and the crew, but also the listeners and everybody involved.
[01:36:09.554 --> 01:36:11.495]  Okay, so let's just get that on the table.
[01:36:11.835 --> 01:36:12.355]  That's a fact.
[01:36:12.856 --> 01:36:26.942]  Tucker Carlson, who's a great guy, twice this week, twice last week that I know of, came out and said on multiple stories about replacement migration, on the FBI agent liaisoning inside Twitter to censor everybody.
[01:36:27.222 --> 01:36:27.963]  That's just a Twitter.
[01:36:28.383 --> 01:36:30.624]  He said, well, Alex Jones was the first person to break this.
[01:36:31.244 --> 01:36:31.965]  Alex Jones is right.
[01:36:32.885 --> 01:36:35.506]  It isn't about Alex Jones getting the credit.
[01:36:35.586 --> 01:36:38.688]  It's about people understanding that I know what I'm talking about.
[01:36:40.945 --> 01:36:48.710]  If you want to know why they finally came after me so hard six years ago, it's because I just don't do what I do here on air.
[01:36:49.850 --> 01:36:56.094]  Behind the scenes, we are basically as effective as we are to this main audience.
[01:36:57.295 --> 01:37:05.939]  So we have a big grassroots reach out to the public, but we also have, because of my prominence, I'm able to talk to whoever I want to.
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:08.001]  Basically.
[01:37:08.843 --> 01:37:12.364]  And people know I'll have off-the-record conversations that I never burn those people.
[01:37:12.424 --> 01:37:14.024]  So I've met with members of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:37:14.645 --> 01:37:16.465]  I've met with former presidents.
[01:37:16.545 --> 01:37:17.265]  I've met with you name it.
[01:37:17.485 --> 01:37:19.086]  And I'm not trying to tell you all that to impress you.
[01:37:20.086 --> 01:37:29.349]  I'm trying to explain to you that because I know how the politics really works and I know how the world really works, I'm able to actually communicate with the highest levels and have real discussions.
[01:37:29.929 --> 01:37:40.772]   Because if you don't have that ability to actually know the full-spectrum, multifaceted, fifth, sixth, seven-dimensional discussion, Then these people don't even talk to you.
[01:37:44.475 --> 01:37:51.882]  And so you've seen the inordinate obsession in the power structure with Infowars.
[01:37:51.942 --> 01:37:54.004]  They were already obsessed because we're populist.
[01:37:54.324 --> 01:37:56.266]  They were already obsessed because we were successful.
[01:37:56.606 --> 01:37:59.409]  They were already obsessed because we were exposing their New World Order.
[01:38:00.109 --> 01:38:12.637]   But when I began to hire and pay prominent think tanks and law firms behind the scenes in 2017-18 to
[01:38:12.637 --> 01:38:16.707]   write reports where I would give them the data in a fact sheet and I'd say I want the lawyers and
[01:38:16.707 --> 01:38:21.947]   think tank to check this and give them a bibliography with the addendum folder with the
[01:38:21.947 --> 01:38:29.557]   syllabus to prove what I'm saying and when I delivered three reports to Trump into his hands
[01:38:29.557 --> 01:38:40.797]   that's when you saw the headlines General Kelly's main job is keeping Trump away from InfoWars
[01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:41.681]  And stuff like that.
[01:38:42.782 --> 01:38:52.529]  So, we know the enemy's number, we know how to beat them, we're over the target, we know history, we understand the globalists, we know how to stop them.
[01:38:54.491 --> 01:39:02.871]   And so their fear Of this operation has been the example to what everybody else should do.
[01:39:03.392 --> 01:39:09.762]  They're the most afraid of this show because I actually have done the research and have had their number.
[01:39:11.164 --> 01:39:13.187]  I know how to beat these people.
[01:39:14.778 --> 01:39:15.879]  God gave me that gift.
[01:39:15.899 --> 01:39:18.960]  For whatever reason, I don't know why other people didn't do this.
[01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:20.501]  I don't know why other people don't understand it.
[01:39:20.881 --> 01:39:22.882]  I don't know why other people don't get how it really works.
[01:39:22.942 --> 01:39:28.205]  But for whatever reason, I have innately understood this since I was a young child.
[01:39:28.285 --> 01:39:34.928]  I was obsessed with war and systems and history and geopolitics and all of this.
[01:39:35.028 --> 01:39:36.109]  Machiavellian systems.
[01:39:37.210 --> 01:39:38.790]  I don't use Machiavellian systems.
[01:39:38.890 --> 01:39:40.951]  I expose Machiavelli.
[01:39:41.551 --> 01:39:42.791]  I'm the anti-Machiavelli.
[01:39:43.072 --> 01:39:46.152]  And Machiavelli was really the anti-suckerfuge.
[01:39:46.492 --> 01:39:47.553]  He was telling you the tricks.
[01:39:48.073 --> 01:39:49.373]  So really I am the Machiavelli.
[01:39:51.414 --> 01:39:52.814]  To show you I really know Machiavelli.
[01:39:56.155 --> 01:39:59.436]  And so that's what's so frustrating is I know the big picture.
[01:39:59.716 --> 01:40:00.836]  I know how to beat the enemy.
[01:40:02.316 --> 01:40:03.117]  So I'll say it this way.
[01:40:03.137 --> 01:40:04.617]  This is the best way to start with the listeners.
[01:40:06.724 --> 01:40:07.565]  It's not going to be the ADL.
[01:40:07.585 --> 01:40:10.287]  It's not going to be the Democratic Party.
[01:40:10.307 --> 01:40:11.688]  It's not going to be the Southern Primary Law Center.
[01:40:11.708 --> 01:40:13.529]  It's not going to be the EU.
[01:40:13.589 --> 01:40:16.391]  It's not going to be Twitter or Facebook or Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:40:16.691 --> 01:40:18.953]  It's not going to be those people that shut us down.
[01:40:20.334 --> 01:40:21.274]  It's going to be you.
[01:40:22.375 --> 01:40:29.280]  The viewers and listeners who don't realize what you're part of, how important you are, that will shut this operation down.
[01:40:31.882 --> 01:40:44.221]   And it's a very sick paradigm and paradox That I'm constantly right on the edge of the red and black for years.
[01:40:45.061 --> 01:40:48.964]  And that I've constantly got to tell you how desperate the situation is.
[01:40:49.164 --> 01:40:51.325]  But it is on every other front in your own life, isn't it?
[01:40:52.266 --> 01:40:53.807]  Aren't most of you living paycheck to paycheck?
[01:40:54.007 --> 01:40:55.588]  Aren't most of you, it's like a battle?
[01:40:55.808 --> 01:40:57.469]  Because that's evil versus good, folks.
[01:40:57.849 --> 01:40:58.910]  That's how the universe works.
[01:40:59.890 --> 01:41:00.491]  It's balanced.
[01:41:01.926 --> 01:41:04.287]  And it's who has the will to carry it through that wins.
[01:41:04.347 --> 01:41:07.788]  So we're right at the most important point in history.
[01:41:08.188 --> 01:41:12.969]  We're in the fourth quarter, last three minutes of the game, tied.
[01:41:13.669 --> 01:41:14.509]  We have the ball.
[01:41:14.970 --> 01:41:16.150]  We're at the 50-yard line.
[01:41:16.530 --> 01:41:23.392]  It's time to get in the zone and realize what we're doing and quadruple down and ask God for guidance and win.
[01:41:24.801 --> 01:41:25.221]  I'll tell you.
[01:41:26.062 --> 01:41:27.522]  Everybody gets confused by all the headlines.
[01:41:27.782 --> 01:41:28.763]  Oh, a billion and a half dollars.
[01:41:28.823 --> 01:41:31.024]  Oh, they want, you know, 7.5 trillion.
[01:41:31.184 --> 01:41:34.145]  Oh, that's meant to be overwhelming and just make us give up.
[01:41:34.205 --> 01:41:34.926]  That's propaganda.
[01:41:35.666 --> 01:41:36.446]  I have appeals.
[01:41:36.907 --> 01:41:37.647]  I have the system.
[01:41:37.927 --> 01:41:39.888]  I went into bankruptcy because our company's out of money.
[01:41:40.808 --> 01:41:46.151]  I went into personal bankruptcy because I'm out of money, and I'm going to show the world in the next few weeks all the cards on the table.
[01:41:48.971 --> 01:41:54.610]   I have like $300,000 in the bank, and with the bills I have,
[01:41:54.610 --> 01:42:00.150]   just on legal and everything else, I'm in the hole for real debts, millions of dollars,
[01:42:00.150 --> 01:42:05.010]   much less the trillions they claim I own or the billions they claim I own.
[01:42:05.010 --> 01:42:05.831]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:42:05.831 --> 01:42:11.170]   There's a process if we just have the money to fund the company and the crew
[01:42:11.170 --> 01:42:12.810]  and have some small profit.
[01:42:12.895 --> 01:42:18.017]  Bankruptcy will let us go forward for years while the appeals take place.
[01:42:18.317 --> 01:42:23.038]  But if we don't have the money to operate, they'll liquidate and shut down InfoWars in the next four months.
[01:42:24.538 --> 01:42:29.319]  So what I say to you, don't listen to all their propaganda and man-behind-the-curtain Wizard of Oz.
[01:42:29.819 --> 01:42:35.061]  Understand, you will shut down InfoWars if you don't go to infowarsstore.com.
[01:42:35.361 --> 01:42:37.841]  Do I not know 50% of our products are sold out?
[01:42:38.121 --> 01:42:40.062]  Do I not know most of the stuff you want is gone?
[01:42:43.592 --> 01:42:44.272]  Yeah, I know that.
[01:42:44.333 --> 01:42:45.093]  That hurts sales.
[01:42:46.614 --> 01:42:50.957]  So I need you to go to InfoWarshaw.com and get what we still have in stock.
[01:42:51.337 --> 01:42:55.140]  And then thank God in February, it's already paid for.
[01:42:55.180 --> 01:42:56.261]  That's where most of the money went.
[01:42:56.761 --> 01:42:58.182]  Almost everything comes back in.
[01:42:58.422 --> 01:43:02.425]  But I'm in a position right now to not make payroll in a month.
[01:43:02.765 --> 01:43:09.227]  When January starts, if I don't get half a million dollars extra into the coffers, that's where I am.
[01:43:09.468 --> 01:43:13.769]  And nothing pains me more than coming to you and begging for your help.
[01:43:13.969 --> 01:43:19.431]  But I'm begging for you to get in the life raft, to get on the lifeboat while the ship is sinking.
[01:43:22.052 --> 01:43:23.733]  It's a no-brainer, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:27.014 --> 01:43:28.996]  So again, I'm going to explain this to all of you.
[01:43:30.077 --> 01:43:31.958]  I am in your hands.
[01:43:32.559 --> 01:43:34.260]  You are in my hands.
[01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:39.925]  I know there's millions of people tuned in right now, and I know a tiny fraction of you.
[01:43:40.305 --> 01:43:53.175]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com and get the great products like Vitamin Mineral Fusion, DNA Force Plus, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, Brain Force Plus, the Ultimate Vitamin C 1100% Organic with Zinc and Rosehips.
[01:43:54.096 --> 01:43:57.037]  The Vitamin D3 with all the viruses and crap going on.
[01:43:57.998 --> 01:44:00.719]  You're insane if you don't take the Vitamin D3 gummies with calcium.
[01:44:01.159 --> 01:44:02.040]  It's all there.
[01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:03.621]  The Vazo Beats.
[01:44:05.041 --> 01:44:05.982]  The Ultra 12.
[01:44:06.862 --> 01:44:08.483]  There is nothing more frustrating.
[01:44:09.527 --> 01:44:14.067]   Living right here on the edge of victory and the edge of defeat in this paradox
[01:44:14.067 --> 01:44:18.226]   Trying to explain to people the only people that can shut down
[01:44:18.226 --> 01:44:24.206]   Infowars.com the next two years before these appeals are done, then they may shut us down is you
[01:44:24.206 --> 01:44:28.725]   Please don't shut us down. Please go to Infowars.com right now
[01:44:28.725 --> 01:44:33.606]   the grid You
[01:44:33.606 --> 01:44:52.806]   You And then
[01:45:02.327 --> 01:45:07.047]  And then I got in.
[01:45:06.843 --> 01:45:13.886]  And they know I got in.
[01:45:13.946 --> 01:45:16.508]  And they know you got in.
[01:45:16.528 --> 01:45:18.248]  And they fear us.
[01:45:19.329 --> 01:45:22.350]  Because they don't want to deal with us being aware of what they're doing.
[01:45:22.650 --> 01:45:25.072]  They want us to roll over to die like Fauci.
[01:45:26.252 --> 01:45:27.353]  And the rest of them won't.
[01:45:28.833 --> 01:45:29.614]  We're not gonna do it.
[01:45:30.984 --> 01:45:32.266]  Here's an example of what I was saying earlier.
[01:45:32.286 --> 01:45:34.268]  I told you these products are all going to sell out.
[01:45:34.449 --> 01:45:36.511]  Bodies Open Tumor Formula, sold out.
[01:45:37.393 --> 01:45:38.854]  More of it isn't coming in until February.
[01:45:39.821 --> 01:46:06.534]  We're selling out of everything and it's just it's like God tortures me and I love God I don't question God but it's like I'm like literally in a video game with half a life left at the end stage about to beat the main boss and I'm sitting here trying to explain to listeners and viewers you're the ones that put the energy in to the life to win the game and you're literally in this fight they're attacking you they're coming after you what are you going to do?
[01:46:07.762 --> 01:46:18.891]  So we still have DNA Force Plus, we still have Atom Mineral Fusion, we still have a bunch of other great products at InForce4.com, but they're all selling out and we need the funds to fund the operation.
[01:46:18.931 --> 01:46:21.233]  We have free shipping on worse dollars or more.
[01:46:21.273 --> 01:46:23.414]  We have up to 60% off the promo code 7076.
[01:46:23.514 --> 01:46:46.205]   We got to move a lot of product to fund this operation and You know the sick part of me just wants to just shut this all down and people remember what I said and what I did and just I've done my 28 years and the rest of but I can't give up and and then so that's why I'm so frustrated right at the moment we're having the biggest effect we've ever had in the world.
[01:46:47.148 --> 01:46:50.872]  Because of supply chain breakdowns and issues and my own mismanagement of things.
[01:46:51.212 --> 01:46:52.753]  Nobody's perfect in the last couple years.
[01:46:53.294 --> 01:46:56.077]  We do not have the funds we need.
[01:46:56.597 --> 01:46:59.099]  And thank God for whoever that Bitcoin donor was.
[01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:03.464]  Because it turned out we were millions and millions and millions of dollars.
[01:47:03.564 --> 01:47:04.444]  It was like God did it.
[01:47:04.505 --> 01:47:07.247]  God, whoever told them to give that exact amount, because I didn't even know the numbers.
[01:47:07.267 --> 01:47:07.928]  We had an accounting letter.
[01:47:08.268 --> 01:47:09.830]  We were five million dollars in the hole.
[01:47:11.038 --> 01:47:18.210]  In the last year, we needed two million dollars to buy a new product, to be able to fund ourselves, and that exact amount got given.
[01:47:19.451 --> 01:47:24.733]  And it was exactly what we needed to bring us into the black only for six, seven months.
[01:47:24.873 --> 01:47:30.975]  And now we're not even $500,000 in the hole, but we don't have any reserves.
[01:47:31.575 --> 01:47:33.195]  I've spent all the reserves.
[01:47:33.735 --> 01:47:35.856]  The company doesn't have reserves.
[01:47:36.216 --> 01:47:37.977]  The enemy is getting what it wants.
[01:47:38.017 --> 01:47:41.058]  They're going to win, but they're not the ones that were successful.
[01:47:41.278 --> 01:47:42.718]  And I'm not putting a guilt trip on you.
[01:47:42.978 --> 01:47:44.419]  I'm going to say it very simply.
[01:47:45.219 --> 01:47:46.059]  I'm in your hands.
[01:47:46.359 --> 01:47:47.840]  This operation's in your hands.
[01:47:49.016 --> 01:47:52.423]  And if you don't donate, you shut down InfoWars.
[01:47:53.586 --> 01:47:56.692]  And that is something that I guess some of you will be proud of.
[01:47:57.864 --> 01:48:00.425]  Some of you, too, don't think this is funny to get rid of the First Amendment.
[01:48:00.585 --> 01:48:04.986]  It's funny to have the Deep State and the Justice Department and the CIA getting up on you.
[01:48:05.246 --> 01:48:09.108]  You think it's funny you've joined with the system, pretending like you're part of the power structure.
[01:48:09.808 --> 01:48:11.128]  And you're on the winning team.
[01:48:11.168 --> 01:48:11.909]  You're fools.
[01:48:12.249 --> 01:48:12.929]  You're schmucks.
[01:48:13.289 --> 01:48:14.210]  You're useful idiots.
[01:48:14.230 --> 01:48:15.370]  I'm not talking about our general audience.
[01:48:15.670 --> 01:48:21.852]  But people that believe that they've gone along with this corrupt system, they're going to get ahead, are beyond insane.
[01:48:22.112 --> 01:48:24.353]  They are spiritually suicidal.
[01:48:27.819 --> 01:48:32.585]  I'll say this, because I was talking to the crew last night and what we have left in the warehouse.
[01:48:33.426 --> 01:48:37.912]  We're going to end the 60% off and the Double Patreon points.
[01:48:38.552 --> 01:48:39.293]  Not the free shipping.
[01:48:39.874 --> 01:48:41.076]  We're going to end it on Monday.
[01:48:41.991 --> 01:48:43.292]  Because everything's about to sell out.
[01:48:43.692 --> 01:48:47.335]  And they said, listen, boss, by February, whatever's left will sell at full price.
[01:48:47.395 --> 01:48:48.916]  It might bring in enough money to fund things.
[01:48:49.276 --> 01:48:50.677]  You got to end the sale this weekend.
[01:48:51.037 --> 01:48:52.118]  And so the sale ends.
[01:48:52.718 --> 01:48:55.740]  You can also go to infowarestore.com at the top where it says support.
[01:48:56.240 --> 01:48:56.941]  You can click on that.
[01:48:56.981 --> 01:48:58.022]  There's a donation button for $10, $100, $1,000.
[01:49:00.283 --> 01:49:01.584]  Those donations do not go to me.
[01:49:01.964 --> 01:49:04.384]  They go to free speech systems to keep us on the air.
[01:49:04.665 --> 01:49:09.766]  And again, it doesn't go to the leftists, to the Democratic Party, and all those people that suit us.
[01:49:10.126 --> 01:49:11.687]  It goes for our appeals.
[01:49:12.067 --> 01:49:13.347]  It goes to keep us on air.
[01:49:13.587 --> 01:49:17.569]  That's why they're on air saying, we don't want money, because they've already got our financials.
[01:49:17.589 --> 01:49:18.309]  They know there's no money.
[01:49:18.589 --> 01:49:20.450]  They go, we want him off the air.
[01:49:20.790 --> 01:49:21.850]  That's their goal.
[01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:24.271]  Don't give them what they want.
[01:49:26.212 --> 01:49:30.036]  But even if you don't have $5 to buy a product or donate at InfoWarsware.com, that's fine.
[01:49:31.158 --> 01:49:32.438]  Go to your city council and speak.
[01:49:32.458 --> 01:49:33.799]  They make you sign up a week before online.
[01:49:33.839 --> 01:49:34.179]  It's easy.
[01:49:34.659 --> 01:49:35.579]  Go to your county commissioners.
[01:49:35.619 --> 01:49:36.299]  Go to your school board.
[01:49:36.319 --> 01:49:37.039]  They're so scared of that.
[01:49:37.299 --> 01:49:38.479]  And just go talk about the New World Order.
[01:49:38.719 --> 01:49:39.800]  Talk about whatever issue you want.
[01:49:40.340 --> 01:49:47.261]  Critical race theory, the transgendered operation, the open borders, the fentanyl, the New World Order, the voting fraud.
[01:49:47.541 --> 01:49:48.821]  Have your voice heard.
[01:49:49.081 --> 01:49:57.103]  Because that's really the king currency in this whole fight is your speech and your resistance and what you say and what you do.
[01:49:57.683 --> 01:49:58.584]  Call into C-SPAN.
[01:49:58.884 --> 01:49:59.785]  Call and talk radio.
[01:50:00.165 --> 01:50:00.485]  March.
[01:50:01.005 --> 01:50:01.626]  Demonstrate.
[01:50:02.086 --> 01:50:03.207]  Go to your church and speak.
[01:50:03.547 --> 01:50:09.751]  If your church isn't talking about world government, the Mark of the Beast, and how whether you love the Ukrainians or not, I'm neutral.
[01:50:10.111 --> 01:50:16.336]  Zelensky banning the oldest church in Ukraine, over a thousand years old, is a criminal action.
[01:50:16.516 --> 01:50:17.616]  It is outrageous.
[01:50:18.037 --> 01:50:19.017]  It is insane.
[01:50:19.418 --> 01:50:20.678]  It is out of control.
[01:50:20.999 --> 01:50:22.520]  By the way, did I send you guys that?
[01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:23.400]  I didn't see it in the list.
[01:50:24.801 --> 01:50:25.482]  Tucker Carlson.
[01:50:25.502 --> 01:50:26.963]  I guess I sent it yesterday, but I wouldn't hear it yesterday.
[01:50:27.943 --> 01:50:28.944]  That family member had surgery.
[01:50:29.784 --> 01:50:38.967]  Tucker Carlson did an excellent six minute report on the Orthodox Church being banned in Ukraine.
[01:50:39.267 --> 01:50:48.571]  I mean, this is governments banning mainline churches, the number one or number two denomination in Ukraine.
[01:50:51.198 --> 01:50:53.200]  It is so dangerous.
[01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:54.140]  It is so real.
[01:50:54.661 --> 01:51:02.807]  Because they're normalizing tyranny that we historically know is incredibly bad and incredibly out of control.
[01:51:04.428 --> 01:51:05.509]  And they're just normalizing it.
[01:51:05.729 --> 01:51:08.851]  But it's up to us to say, this isn't normal.
[01:51:09.492 --> 01:51:10.673]  This isn't right.
[01:51:11.113 --> 01:51:13.475]  And this isn't going to be put up with.
[01:51:14.935 --> 01:51:17.498]  By the way, I'm coming in tomorrow for a commercial light.
[01:51:17.518 --> 01:51:18.599]  I mean, we won't have breaks.
[01:51:18.739 --> 01:51:22.743]  We'll have a few breaks here and there when I take a break, go to the bathroom or whatever.
[01:51:22.763 --> 01:51:33.751]   We're going to tape for like two or three hours tomorrow with Dr. Huff, the huge whistleblower from inside the Wuhan lab, the head scientist at Peter Daszak's It just drives me crazy.
[01:51:33.791 --> 01:51:35.492]  Let me ask the crew again.
[01:51:35.512 --> 01:51:38.993]  Is the Tucker Carlson clip with him on the banning of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church on the list?
[01:51:38.833 --> 01:51:43.313]   Steve Quayle on and others tomorrow. That special report will air at 4 p.m.
[01:51:43.313 --> 01:51:51.153]   Central Standard Time. It just drives me crazy because, let me ask the crew again,
[01:51:51.153 --> 01:51:56.593]   just, just, is the Tucker Carlson clip with him on the banning of the Ukrainian
[01:51:56.593 --> 01:52:06.313]   Church, the Orthodox Church, is on the list? You're grabbing it? I sent it yesterday.
[01:52:04.508 --> 01:52:08.551]  In fact, which means it's in this stack right here.
[01:52:08.591 --> 01:52:09.491]  Let's just go to this stack.
[01:52:09.892 --> 01:52:11.413]  We could go through yesterday's stack I sent.
[01:52:11.773 --> 01:52:13.054]  I wasn't here, but I sent the stack.
[01:52:13.334 --> 01:52:14.375]  Here, let's do an overhead shot.
[01:52:14.395 --> 01:52:15.216]  Let's do an overhead shot.
[01:52:15.036 --> 01:52:25.555]   shot. We do that. Vanguard quits Climate Alliance and blow to net zero.
[01:52:24.693 --> 01:52:26.074]  Look at this shot of your TV viewer.
[01:52:26.454 --> 01:52:27.334]  Global warming is real.
[01:52:27.374 --> 01:52:34.037]  Look how it changed from a cool green to a hot red caused by not surrendering your property and liberty to the WEF.
[01:52:34.417 --> 01:52:39.899]  And it shows from 2017 a green map, which the satellite shows, with even hotter temperatures.
[01:52:40.219 --> 01:52:42.340]  So it's 23 in the same place in Germany.
[01:52:43.260 --> 01:52:44.661]  It's 33 when it's green.
[01:52:44.801 --> 01:52:46.281]  It's 23 when it's red.
[01:52:47.362 --> 01:52:48.022]  It's 28 here.
[01:52:48.482 --> 01:52:49.182]  It's 36 there.
[01:52:49.563 --> 01:52:50.523]  But they don't care.
[01:52:50.543 --> 01:52:53.184]  They just show it red to scare you, even though it's actually colder.
[01:52:55.136 --> 01:53:00.576]  Got a whole stack of news on that coming up.
[01:53:01.576 --> 01:53:06.975]   Whatever you think of the war in Ukraine, it is pretty clear that Zelensky has no
[01:53:06.975 --> 01:53:11.615]   interest in freedom and democracy. In fact, Zelensky is far closer to Lenin
[01:53:11.615 --> 01:53:17.256]   than to George Washington. He is a dictator. He is a dangerous authoritarian
[01:53:17.256 --> 01:53:21.495]  who has used a hundred billion in U.S.
[01:53:19.247 --> 01:53:22.469]  tax dollars to erect a one-party police state in Ukraine.
[01:53:22.649 --> 01:53:23.690]  And that's not an overstatement.
[01:53:24.470 --> 01:53:27.432]  Over the past year, Zelensky has banned opposition parties.
[01:53:27.913 --> 01:53:29.834]  He shut down critical media by force.
[01:53:30.234 --> 01:53:32.095]  He's arrested his political opponents.
[01:53:32.415 --> 01:53:34.437]  He has sent soldiers into churches.
[01:53:35.686 --> 01:53:49.196]  Zelensky's secret police have raided monasteries across Ukraine, even a convent full of nuns, and arrested dozens of priests for no justifiable reason whatsoever, and in clear violation of the Ukrainian constitution, which no longer matters.
[01:53:50.637 --> 01:53:53.799]  And in the face of this, the Biden administration has said nothing.
[01:53:54.039 --> 01:53:54.880]  Not one word.
[01:53:55.540 --> 01:53:58.602]  Instead, they've just continued to push to send Zelensky more tax dollars.
[01:53:58.902 --> 01:54:01.424]  So naturally, Zelensky has become much bolder.
[01:54:01.464 --> 01:54:02.085]  Why wouldn't he?
[01:54:03.012 --> 01:54:12.342]  Last week he announced his plan to ban an entire religion, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, and to seize its property, all for being insufficiently loyal to his regime.
[01:54:12.902 --> 01:54:13.723]  And he said it out loud.
[01:54:13.923 --> 01:54:14.324]  Watch this.
[01:54:17.292 --> 01:54:26.259]  We have to create such conditions when any people dependent on the country aggressor won't be able to manipulate Ukrainians and weaken Ukraine from within.
[01:54:26.540 --> 01:54:41.873]  First, the National Security and Defense Council instructed the government to submit to the Verkhovna Rada, a draft law on making it impossible for religious organizations affiliated with centers of influence in the Russian Federation to operate in Ukraine.
[01:54:43.533 --> 01:54:50.159]  A free country does not ban a major religion, just because it's not fully on board with the political program of the people running the country.
[01:54:51.120 --> 01:54:58.446]  But Zelensky's doing that, and his cabinet is now devising ways to punish Christians for practicing their banned ancient religion in Ukraine.
[01:54:58.486 --> 01:55:05.052]  Quote, personal economic and restrictive sanctions will be applied to any Christian caught worshipping in unapproved ways.
[01:55:06.109 --> 01:55:09.790]  Now, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church is more than a thousand years old.
[01:55:10.710 --> 01:55:13.431]  With the full backing of the Joe Biden administration and the U.S.
[01:55:13.491 --> 01:55:15.371]  Congress, Zelensky has decided to ban it.
[01:55:16.451 --> 01:55:18.672]  So, here's the response of one bishop to the news.
[01:55:20.192 --> 01:55:23.573]  Dear brothers and sisters, God is with you.
[01:55:23.713 --> 01:55:26.453]  You know, do not be afraid of anything.
[01:55:26.273 --> 01:55:49.273]  [Russian]
[01:55:49.273 --> 01:55:53.273]  You're not allowed to send soldiers into churches.
[01:55:53.315 --> 01:55:57.057]  You're not allowed to arrest dozens of priests because they refuse to bow before you.
[01:55:57.097 --> 01:55:59.657]  You're not allowed to ban whole religions.
[01:56:00.738 --> 01:56:03.399]  So most of the US media, most, have just ignored this.
[01:56:03.539 --> 01:56:05.059]  Some have made excuses for it.
[01:56:05.199 --> 01:56:07.040]  Oh, he has to do this because there's a war.
[01:56:08.183 --> 01:56:10.245]  But there's no justification for this whatsoever.
[01:56:10.945 --> 01:56:13.867]  The Ukrainian Orthodox Church is not Russian, it's Ukrainian.
[01:56:13.927 --> 01:56:15.929]  It has no connection to the Putin government.
[01:56:15.969 --> 01:56:19.552]  It has in fact officially denounced the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
[01:56:19.752 --> 01:56:24.055]  So once again, there is no justification for destroying and banning this church.
[01:56:25.356 --> 01:56:29.179]  And yet, Zelensky's many celebrity backers in the West have said nothing about it.
[01:56:30.100 --> 01:56:30.941]  And they should know better.
[01:56:31.972 --> 01:56:43.020]  In May, George W. Bush, the great defender of Christendom, met with Zelensky on a Zoom call and afterward described him as the Winston Churchill of our time, a man who should be praised for his, quote, commitment to liberty.
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:45.622]  So where's George W. Bush on this question?
[01:56:46.002 --> 01:56:51.045]  Now that his friend, the George Washington of Ukraine, has banned a form of Christianity in that country.
[01:56:51.085 --> 01:56:52.927]  Well, George W. Bush has been silent as well.
[01:56:53.467 --> 01:56:55.629]  So have many purportedly Christian members of Congress.
[01:56:55.669 --> 01:57:00.132]  They're backing Zelensky no matter how many Christians he arrests, no matter how many churches he seizes.
[01:57:01.661 --> 01:57:06.273]  To the Ukrainian people, you can expect the Congress to...
[01:57:08.547 --> 01:57:12.549]  To be there with you in terms of supporting your efforts to maintain your freedom.
[01:57:12.769 --> 01:57:17.912]  Everything that we can do to be helpful to them as they fight for their freedom.
[01:57:18.112 --> 01:57:23.074]  I think the history of the 21st century turns on how fiercely we defend freedom in Ukraine.
[01:57:23.234 --> 01:57:28.537]  We will continue to provide military equipment so that Ukraine can defend its territory and its freedom.
[01:57:28.697 --> 01:57:33.279]  The United States will continue our unwavering support for Ukraine as it defends its freedom.
[01:57:33.500 --> 01:57:38.102]  And let's get the job done so that we can save lives in Ukraine and defend the cause of freedom.
[01:57:38.362 --> 01:57:40.162]  The free world had no choice.
[01:57:40.182 --> 01:57:42.723]  America could not stand by.
[01:57:42.923 --> 01:57:44.904]  The American people did what they always have done.
[01:57:44.924 --> 01:57:47.184]  Defend freedom around the world.
[01:57:48.744 --> 01:57:57.446]  Every single person you just watched has campaigned, many make a habit of campaigning, Lindsey Graham, ladies and gentlemen, in Christian churches in the United States.
[01:57:57.467 --> 01:58:00.047]  Will a single Christian leader say anything to them about this?
[01:58:00.447 --> 01:58:03.168]  You are funding the destruction of Christianity in Ukraine?
[01:58:04.221 --> 01:58:05.402]  Oh, but it's the cause of freedom.
[01:58:05.642 --> 01:58:05.902]  Really?
[01:58:06.382 --> 01:58:12.727]  The reality is that Ukrainians cannot listen to media outlets that criticize the Zelensky government because they've been banned.
[01:58:13.327 --> 01:58:15.929]  They cannot play music from Russian singers.
[01:58:16.029 --> 01:58:18.630]  No, this is not in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.
[01:58:18.911 --> 01:58:21.552]  This is in the democracy of Ukraine that we support.
[01:58:21.572 --> 01:58:22.753]  They can't play music from Russian singers.
[01:58:23.033 --> 01:58:25.695]  They can't vote for an opposition party because they've all been shut down.
[01:58:25.955 --> 01:58:28.057]  And now their churches are being raided and their priests arrested.
[01:58:29.117 --> 01:58:33.018]  So the fact that our leaders are calling this freedom tells you a lot about what they're planning here.
[01:58:33.638 --> 01:58:34.039]  Of course.
[01:58:34.299 --> 01:58:35.119]  Why would you defend this?
[01:58:35.179 --> 01:58:36.079]  Because you approve of it.
[01:58:37.039 --> 01:58:40.180]  For its part, Ukraine's defense ministry has stopped pretending this is about freedom.
[01:58:40.581 --> 01:58:45.802]  They're just happy they're getting paid, and they're finally crushing any opposition in their own country.
[01:58:49.043 --> 01:58:53.444]  That really is next level, what's happening in Ukraine.
[01:58:53.524 --> 01:58:54.845]  And I'm not a rucifile, I'm not...
[01:58:55.919 --> 01:58:57.440]  Happy Russia's in Ukraine.
[01:58:58.140 --> 01:58:59.040]  I don't support any of this.
[01:58:59.060 --> 01:59:04.582]  I don't support the nuclear war or the energy prices or any of the dangers we face for things that are already happening.
[01:59:05.422 --> 01:59:22.188]  But it really is frustrating to be sitting back here watching this happen and to see all of our basic freedoms that are so far so hard fought being completely flushed down the toilet.
[01:59:24.549 --> 01:59:25.269]  It really is sad.
[01:59:28.749 --> 01:59:33.890]  But I think all of you deep down know that we're not going to stop what's happening.
[01:59:34.190 --> 01:59:40.372]  We can just mitigate it for the innocent and try to protect as many children as possible with what's going to happen.
[01:59:40.572 --> 01:59:47.253]  And it's our job to persevere and keep speaking truth throughout what is now unfolding and now what is happening.
[01:59:48.713 --> 01:59:51.514]  Because this is a completely unnatural society we live in.
[01:59:53.328 --> 01:59:54.729]  And it's coming down.
[01:59:55.249 --> 01:59:56.849]  And the system knows it's coming down.
[01:59:57.289 --> 02:00:01.311]  They're trying to artificially bring it down so they're in control at the end of it.
[02:00:01.631 --> 02:00:03.271]  They're not going to be in control of anything.
[02:00:03.571 --> 02:00:04.692]  So take that solace.
[02:00:06.853 --> 02:00:10.954]  Take that solace that none of this.
[02:00:12.898 --> 02:00:22.102]  Not the IMF, not the World Bank, not the Federal Reserve, not the Rothschilds, not the King Charles III, not the ADL.
[02:00:23.082 --> 02:00:27.484]  None of these pathetic control freaks are connected to God.
[02:00:28.685 --> 02:00:30.005]  They don't have any real power.
[02:00:31.326 --> 02:00:33.247]  They're a joke and they're going down.
[02:00:33.827 --> 02:00:36.188]  The sad part is we're going down with them.
[02:00:38.917 --> 02:00:43.240]  If they weren't there working to bring us down, we could stabilize things and fix it.
[02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:47.623]  But the way the universe works is there's good and evil, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:48.424 --> 02:00:57.050]  And we just have to fight evil to show God we're not evil and persevere in our own hearts and that we never give up.
[02:00:59.311 --> 02:01:01.573]  And then God will win this in the end.
[02:01:03.174 --> 02:01:06.336]  But don't ever feel like you're disempowered because you can't beat this.
[02:01:06.677 --> 02:01:07.958]  Believe me, I've tried as hard as I could.
[02:01:08.885 --> 02:01:13.508]  For the first 20-something years on air, I thought, well, God's there, but kind of like a little sad thing I've got.
[02:01:13.968 --> 02:01:14.809]  I can do this myself.
[02:01:15.149 --> 02:01:21.753]  It was always God behind the scenes working through me and working through you to try to change the world.
[02:01:22.594 --> 02:01:25.736]  And we've had incredible harvest in hearts and minds with that.
[02:01:28.417 --> 02:01:38.987]   And maybe If we don't get the support to stay on air in this incarnation, in this model, that's God saying, you've done your job for now.
[02:01:39.448 --> 02:01:43.231]  And knowing, well, this guy never, it's one thing to quit, but I never stop.
[02:01:44.832 --> 02:01:46.573]  So maybe God doesn't want me to be here.
[02:01:47.534 --> 02:01:49.356]  Maybe God wants me to take a break.
[02:01:49.396 --> 02:01:52.278]  Maybe God wants the crew to go somewhere else and do something else.
[02:01:52.638 --> 02:02:00.168]   So I'm kind of coming into that piece of whatever God wants me to do, I'm just going to do it.
[02:02:00.549 --> 02:02:10.535]  And God wants me to keep fighting and not stop and realize that in the scheme of things, the timeless universe and the endlessness of space, what really matters is our souls.
[02:02:10.555 --> 02:02:20.342]  All right, I've got a final segment here before the great Jay Dyer, incredible mind, so informed, real New World Order historian, like 90% of what you'll hear is from their own mouths.
[02:02:20.702 --> 02:02:23.464]  He's coming up in about 15 minutes, but we'll go to break, come back with the final segment.
[02:02:23.884 --> 02:02:25.405]  Trey, we have a lot of news we haven't hit yet.
[02:02:25.446 --> 02:02:25.926]  Please stay with us.
[02:02:27.550 --> 02:02:32.431]  Tucker Carlson lately has been particularly on point and fiery.
[02:02:33.631 --> 02:02:39.332]  And so here's three clips of him specifically pointing out that Alex Jones is the writer of the show being brought up.
[02:02:40.532 --> 02:02:43.533]  And why this is important is, this is why the establishment is scared of us.
[02:02:44.193 --> 02:02:47.094]  Tucker understands that pointing that out is something they don't want done.
[02:02:47.654 --> 02:02:49.614]  They want to demonize this broadcast.
[02:02:51.615 --> 02:02:53.955]  Trying to make everybody scared to cover these same topics.
[02:02:55.669 --> 02:03:02.691]  So Tucker realizes championing InfoWars and promoting us is a counter to what they're doing.
[02:03:03.252 --> 02:03:07.553]  This is a war and we're a symbol in that fight the enemy wants to bring down.
[02:03:08.113 --> 02:03:10.454]  Go ahead and play those Tucker Carlson clips back to back.
[02:03:10.987 --> 02:03:16.789]  Twitter and these social media apps have been rigged to control our minds and what we think.
[02:03:17.209 --> 02:03:21.150]  And so I want to be careful because I don't want to unpack too much.
[02:03:21.231 --> 02:03:22.191]  It's hard for people to understand.
[02:03:22.211 --> 02:03:29.994]  But just think about what Alex Jones has experienced over Sandy Hook and the lawsuits against him and the money they've taken from him.
[02:03:30.614 --> 02:03:38.517]   And now I want you to think about what Twitter has done to America for the last seven, eight years with Black Lives Matter.
[02:03:39.017 --> 02:03:50.281]  They promoted the myth and the anger and the animus and the emotion that the police were out here randomly killing black people and everybody should be outraged.
[02:03:50.661 --> 02:03:52.442]  Everybody should take to the streets.
[02:03:52.842 --> 02:03:55.303]  Everybody should burn down cities and communities.
[02:03:55.663 --> 02:03:57.004]  People should kill police.
[02:03:57.344 --> 02:04:03.764]   So if you're the wife of David Dorn, You should be trying to sue whoever's responsible, Twitter,
[02:04:03.764 --> 02:04:08.965]   the democratic party that use this propaganda machine to stir the emotions of
[02:04:08.965 --> 02:04:15.805]   the American people and create, create this myth that the police were out just randomly indiscriminately
[02:04:15.805 --> 02:04:16.804]  killing black people.
[02:04:16.804 --> 02:04:21.604]   And what you should do is overthrow this government. Go tear down buildings.
[02:04:21.604 --> 02:04:27.885]   If your business was destroyed during these riots, these five, six year spans, obviously it crescendoed in
[02:04:27.885 --> 02:04:28.725]  2020.
[02:04:28.925 --> 02:04:34.684]   But if you lost a loved one, lost your business, you're owed a great debt. Twitter,
[02:04:34.684 --> 02:04:39.684]   this propaganda machine was part of controlling the American public's mind and
[02:04:39.684 --> 02:04:45.284]   promoting a level of violence and chaos and anarchy that hurt everyday Americans
[02:04:45.284 --> 02:04:47.925]  cost people's lives.
[02:04:48.232 --> 02:04:50.854]  They're responsible and need to be held accountable.
[02:04:51.214 --> 02:04:54.536]  Our politicians need to hold all these people responsible.
[02:04:54.816 --> 02:04:56.297]  This is very serious.
[02:04:56.557 --> 02:05:01.560]  This isn't about Charlie Kirk or me or anybody that didn't get to grow our Twitter account.
[02:05:01.921 --> 02:05:15.009]  It's about the mind control propaganda game they've been playing on the American public to overthrow our Constitution and our way of life and they've been successful and these people are evil and need to be held responsible.
[02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:25.076]  We can only hope that Elon Musk reveals in soon the degree to which intel agencies from around the world have been operating on Twitter, and I think it's pretty clear it's extensive.
[02:05:25.237 --> 02:05:34.003]  There's no economic justification whatsoever for these levels of immigration, and of course immigration destabilizes your society.
[02:05:34.203 --> 02:05:35.964]  It makes it far less cohesive.
[02:05:35.984 --> 02:05:36.865]  That's always true.
[02:05:36.885 --> 02:05:38.406]  It doesn't matter where they're coming from.
[02:05:38.746 --> 02:05:42.009]   If you have a ton of new people, You're less cohesive.
[02:05:42.029 --> 02:05:42.669]  So why are they coming?
[02:05:42.689 --> 02:05:43.710]  Well, there's only one reason.
[02:05:44.250 --> 02:05:46.550]  Because the Democratic Party wants new voters.
[02:05:47.530 --> 02:05:47.890]  Period.
[02:05:48.670 --> 02:05:50.311]  It's not a racist conspiracy.
[02:05:50.351 --> 02:05:51.151]  It's a racist conspiracy!
[02:05:51.211 --> 02:05:51.691]  No, it's not.
[02:05:52.411 --> 02:05:53.011]  It's true.
[02:05:54.211 --> 02:06:02.113]  And we know that it's true, not because we heard it on Alex Jones, but because leading Democrats have said so repeatedly in public for years.
[02:06:02.873 --> 02:06:03.953]  And here's the latest example.
[02:06:03.993 --> 02:06:06.234]  Here is Chuck Schumer, the head Democrat in the U.S.
[02:06:06.254 --> 02:06:07.194]  Senate, last month.
[02:06:08.402 --> 02:06:11.184]  Now more than ever, we're short of workers.
[02:06:12.365 --> 02:06:18.851]  We have a population that is not reproducing it on its own with the same level that it used to.
[02:06:19.412 --> 02:06:26.357]  The only way we're going to have a great future in America is if we welcome and embrace immigrants, the dreamers, and all of them.
[02:06:26.377 --> 02:06:34.745]  Because our ultimate goal is to help the dreamers, but get a path to citizenship for all 11 million or however many undocumented there are here.
[02:06:36.320 --> 02:06:37.801]  Everything about that was a lie.
[02:06:37.861 --> 02:06:38.961]  We need workers, really?
[02:06:39.402 --> 02:06:43.664]  There are, what, 7 million American-born men who have dropped out of the workforce?
[02:06:44.144 --> 02:06:47.086]  Workforce age who just aren't working, who are on the internet all day?
[02:06:47.226 --> 02:06:47.966]  Does anyone care?
[02:06:47.986 --> 02:06:48.566]  No!
[02:06:49.227 --> 02:06:50.027]  Just replace them!
[02:06:50.868 --> 02:06:52.128]  Americans aren't reproducing.
[02:06:52.248 --> 02:06:52.528]  Really?
[02:06:52.689 --> 02:06:53.109]  Why?
[02:06:53.609 --> 02:06:55.430]  Well, because the economy has changed.
[02:06:56.230 --> 02:06:57.331]  And what's their answer to that?
[02:06:57.371 --> 02:06:58.412]  The Democratic Party's answer?
[02:06:58.432 --> 02:07:02.794]  Well, the Treasury Secretary told us a month and a half ago, she said, if you're worried about the economy, have an abortion.
[02:07:04.500 --> 02:07:06.602]  People who want to have kids increasingly can't.
[02:07:06.822 --> 02:07:07.483]  Why is that?
[02:07:07.723 --> 02:07:15.230]  Well, because the food supply and the air and water have been poisoned and sperm counts are half what they were a few decades ago.
[02:07:15.871 --> 02:07:25.240]  So these are specific problems that have prevented millions of Americans from having families, from reproducing, as Chuck Schumer just said.
[02:07:25.820 --> 02:07:27.161]  And you could fix them if you tried.
[02:07:28.237 --> 02:07:29.017]  But they're not trying.
[02:07:29.438 --> 02:07:35.882]  Instead, the solution is to replace the people who aren't reproducing with millions of new people from other countries.
[02:07:36.302 --> 02:07:37.743]  That's not a racist conspiracy theory.
[02:07:38.123 --> 02:07:39.604]  Chuck Schumer just said it!
[02:07:40.204 --> 02:07:42.526]  They treat you like a terrorist, essentially.
[02:07:42.546 --> 02:07:43.806]  They treat you the exact same way.
[02:07:44.047 --> 02:07:45.327]  They mix these reports together.
[02:07:45.387 --> 02:07:50.210]  They get former CIA directors and former FBI directors to come out and back it up and make it all very serious.
[02:07:50.771 --> 02:07:55.754]  I can't believe how right people like Glenn Greenwald were back in the day about all of this when they first saw it.
[02:07:56.769 --> 02:08:03.312]  Well, and Alex Jones, for that matter, who said our intel agencies are interfering in domestic politics.
[02:08:03.353 --> 02:08:08.935]  And people like me said, that's impossible, that's illegal, it's immoral, it's totalitarian, that can't possibly be happening.
[02:08:08.955 --> 02:08:09.576]  You're crazy!
[02:08:09.896 --> 02:08:11.537]  But that is happening, openly!
[02:08:13.089 --> 02:08:17.072]  The amount of people... I was very doubtful at first when these things first started to come out.
[02:08:17.392 --> 02:08:22.796]  When people were saying that the same groups that are being set up to fight Al-Qaeda will someday be turned into American citizens.
[02:08:22.837 --> 02:08:23.857]  I said, that's ridiculous.
[02:08:24.158 --> 02:08:27.440]  I went to Ground Zero shortly after I saw it.
[02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:29.261]  I felt that pain.
[02:08:29.301 --> 02:08:31.563]  It was awful to be around, and people were really frightened.
[02:08:31.923 --> 02:08:33.625]  But all those people were completely right.
[02:08:33.665 --> 02:08:34.505]  The government's doing this.
[02:08:34.746 --> 02:08:36.867]  The government's working with Twitter now, it's coming out.
[02:08:36.887 --> 02:08:42.752]  The government's working to shut down scientists, to shut down doctors, to shut down people who later turn out to be completely correct.
[02:08:43.112 --> 02:08:52.515]  And at the same time, Pete, places like Google are working with the New York Times, working with foreign disinformation think tanks to try and shut down journalism, to try and shut down places like I used to work at.
[02:08:52.535 --> 02:08:54.676]  The Federalists cut them off from advertising.
[02:08:54.936 --> 02:08:56.157]  This is a pernicious campaign.
[02:08:56.177 --> 02:08:56.957]  It's about information.
[02:08:56.997 --> 02:08:58.457]  It's about banking, which you've touched on.
[02:08:58.717 --> 02:09:00.318]  And it's even about comedy and movies.
[02:09:00.658 --> 02:09:03.259]  Can't we just have an open conversation in this country anymore?
[02:09:04.119 --> 02:09:04.980]  No, not at all.
[02:09:05.180 --> 02:09:06.000]  This threatens their power.
[02:09:06.020 --> 02:09:07.580]  Because if they have an open conversation, they can't win.
[02:09:08.001 --> 02:09:08.781]  Of course, they'll lose.
[02:09:11.658 --> 02:09:12.979]  All right, Jay Dyer's coming up.
[02:09:14.519 --> 02:09:15.800]  I got a few of the things I want to hit.
[02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:17.600]  You know, there's this Jim Jordan video.
[02:09:18.461 --> 02:09:20.001]  And I wish he wasn't a puppet at Google.
[02:09:20.021 --> 02:09:21.842]  I really wanted to believe in him.
[02:09:22.302 --> 02:09:23.803]  But, you know, they got a lot of money and power.
[02:09:24.503 --> 02:09:25.483]  He's definitely working for them.
[02:09:25.523 --> 02:09:26.124]  It's so sad.
[02:09:26.184 --> 02:09:32.486]  But Jim Jordan ensnares Democrat witness who accused Justice Alito of leaking 2014 ruling.
[02:09:33.046 --> 02:09:34.607]  And he reads to him out of the guy's book.
[02:09:34.707 --> 02:09:39.529]  It's just totally made up about the Supreme Court decision and Supreme Court record.
[02:09:40.606 --> 02:09:41.627]  But that's what Democrats do.
[02:09:41.667 --> 02:09:45.011]  They love to lie about political records.
[02:09:45.031 --> 02:09:46.392]  They love to create fake history.
[02:09:46.833 --> 02:09:48.094]  They love to impersonate.
[02:09:49.896 --> 02:09:58.366]  That's what's happening with this head of the nuclear stockpile that, you know, got caught reportedly in another state stealing more luggage.
[02:09:59.844 --> 02:10:01.806]  They think they can do whatever they want.
[02:10:01.926 --> 02:10:03.588]  They think they've got a total green light.
[02:10:04.068 --> 02:10:10.114]  And once they have control of all the local governments with Soros, prosecutors, he'll be able to do whatever he wants.
[02:10:10.535 --> 02:10:17.221]  I mean, I've got Project Veritas videos, you've seen them, of them not just smuggling kids up from Mexico for sex slavery in Austin, where I live.
[02:10:20.124 --> 02:10:20.485]  But there's...
[02:10:22.256 --> 02:10:33.720]  New videos they've got at major elementary schools where the Dean of Student Affairs teaches first graders how to shove giant objects in their rear ends.
[02:10:34.480 --> 02:10:36.040]  And he's on video teaching them this.
[02:10:36.741 --> 02:10:46.644]  And then when he shows up to school, James O'Keefe, outside they threaten him and throw him off the property and say, there's children here, don't talk about that in front of them.
[02:10:48.244 --> 02:10:50.005]  That's the latest video.
[02:10:53.581 --> 02:10:54.402]  And that's what they're doing.
[02:10:55.542 --> 02:10:56.703]  Let me spend a few minutes on this.
[02:10:56.743 --> 02:10:58.424]  I'm going to play the Jim Jordan video.
[02:10:59.565 --> 02:11:04.308]  People are choosing to become disabled by choice and calling themselves trans-abled.
[02:11:04.328 --> 02:11:07.710]  This woman, psychologists poured bleach in her eyes and blinded her.
[02:11:07.730 --> 02:11:09.031]  They say it's beautiful and wonderful.
[02:11:09.391 --> 02:11:10.832]  She's now blind, we got to take care of her.
[02:11:11.273 --> 02:11:12.293]  They just want to euthanize you.
[02:11:12.834 --> 02:11:15.515]  This person lives in a wheelchair, makes everybody take care of them, they're not sick.
[02:11:19.438 --> 02:11:22.240]  Trans-abled people becoming disabled by choice sparks outrage.

[02:11:26.164 --> 02:11:29.644]  Then I've got scientific reports looking at it like, well, maybe it's legitimate, you know?
[02:11:29.664 --> 02:11:31.525]  This is a good thing.
[02:11:32.105 --> 02:11:33.865]  You don't pay your taxes, you lose your house.
[02:11:33.905 --> 02:11:38.006]  But if you want to cut your leg off, a lot of these folks cut their legs off.

[02:11:48.251 --> 02:11:51.734]  Well, they cut little boys' penises off, they cut little girls' breasts off.
[02:11:52.034 --> 02:11:55.937]  I mean, what do you think the logical extension of this psycho world is?
[02:11:56.337 --> 02:11:57.718]  Here's another one.

[02:12:05.224 --> 02:12:11.830]  You get a doll, and it's got packaging and paperwork about, hey, you're really a boy, let's take hormones.

[02:14:13.935 --> 02:14:14.136]  Yes.
[02:14:15.477 --> 02:14:17.298]  Justice Alito said he didn't tell her.
[02:14:17.979 --> 02:14:19.440]  She said she didn't tell him.
[02:14:19.460 --> 02:14:21.421]  But you're sure she told you?
[02:14:22.122 --> 02:14:22.702]  Absolutely.
[02:14:23.363 --> 02:14:25.265]  Now you wrote a book a couple years ago, is that right?
[02:14:26.195 --> 02:14:28.137]  In 2018, he wrote a book.
[02:14:30.119 --> 02:14:31.860]  I want to read a section from that book.
[02:14:33.422 --> 02:14:41.069]  It's a section where you relate, you and your family attended oral arguments at the court.
[02:14:41.089 --> 02:14:47.134]  You were there in the courtroom, and that directly involved your brother Paul, also a reverend.
[02:14:48.426 --> 02:14:50.707]  And I just want to read this section.
[02:14:50.747 --> 02:15:08.791]  You said, with a single rap of the gavel, Chief Justice William Rehnquist announced, we'll hear argument first this morning in number 95-1065, Reverend Paul Schenck and Dwight Saunders versus Pro-Choice Network of Western New York.
[02:15:10.172 --> 02:15:15.393]  Paul and I winked at each other knowing we had made history with that reverend in his name.
[02:15:16.448 --> 02:15:27.031]  It had been a minor victory when we persuaded the court that reverend should remain before Paul's name, even though we had been told repeatedly that legal briefs never included such titles.
[02:15:28.572 --> 02:15:35.274]  You thought it was important that, obviously based on what he said there, you thought it was important that the title, uh, reverend be in front of Paul's name, is that right?
[02:15:35.554 --> 02:15:35.894]  Correct.
[02:15:36.394 --> 02:15:37.014]  And why was that?
[02:15:37.995 --> 02:15:45.897]  Because we saw it as a religious liberty matter, and that that would make it clear that it fit in that category.
[02:15:47.062 --> 02:15:54.886]  Did Chief Justice Rehnquist really say that the way I just read it from your book?
[02:15:57.027 --> 02:15:58.267]  I can't say that I remember.
[02:15:58.988 --> 02:16:01.109]  Well, you're pretty darn specific here.
[02:16:01.169 --> 02:16:05.211]  You got the number, case number 95-1065.
[02:16:05.691 --> 02:16:09.673]  Very next word says, Reverend Paul Schenck, you made it a big deal.
[02:16:12.474 --> 02:16:14.215]  Thought it's the first time it's ever happened.
[02:16:14.835 --> 02:16:16.216]  I'm just asking, did it really happen?
[02:16:19.068 --> 02:16:19.969]  I wish I could tell.
[02:16:20.069 --> 02:16:22.252]  I would have to go back and review that.
[02:16:22.532 --> 02:16:23.433]  So it may not have?
[02:16:24.434 --> 02:16:25.155]  Possibly not.
[02:16:25.695 --> 02:16:26.736]  Why do you say possibly not?
[02:16:26.776 --> 02:16:27.938]  You were emphatic in your book.
[02:16:31.321 --> 02:16:32.142]  I would have to go back.
[02:16:32.583 --> 02:16:33.464]  Well, we did go back.
[02:16:33.884 --> 02:16:36.207]  We did go back and I got the transcript right here.
[02:16:37.366 --> 02:16:40.887]  Proceedings, 10.05am, Chief Justice Rehnquist.
[02:16:41.468 --> 02:16:52.752]  We'll hear argument first this morning in number 95-1065, Paul Schenck and Dwight Saunders versus Pro-Choice Network of Western New York.
[02:16:54.073 --> 02:16:54.453]  Did you hear it?
[02:16:54.953 --> 02:16:55.213]  I did.
[02:16:55.734 --> 02:16:56.514]  Was there a word missing?
[02:16:58.615 --> 02:16:59.495]  Uh, title reverend?
[02:17:00.255 --> 02:17:00.435]  Yeah.
[02:17:00.896 --> 02:17:01.436]  Wasn't in there.
[02:17:02.576 --> 02:17:05.598]  In your book you said it was a big deal, so much so that you winked at your brother.
[02:17:05.618 --> 02:17:06.398]  Did you wink at your brother?
[02:17:07.984 --> 02:17:08.244]  Yes.
[02:17:09.244 --> 02:17:10.865]  What'd you wink for if it wasn't in the title?
[02:17:11.625 --> 02:17:12.505]  Well, it was our case.
[02:17:13.266 --> 02:17:19.387]  But you, but that's not, you said you winked because they included Reverend in the title and the transcript says Mr. Rehnquist didn't.
[02:17:20.548 --> 02:17:21.068]  Perhaps not.
[02:17:21.688 --> 02:17:22.148]  Perhaps?
[02:17:22.528 --> 02:17:23.409]  Court reporter get it wrong?
[02:17:23.729 --> 02:17:25.169]  Did he say the court reporter get it wrong?
[02:17:26.009 --> 02:17:26.349]  Well then.
[02:17:28.810 --> 02:17:29.970]  Well, we got the audio too.
[02:17:29.789 --> 02:17:31.789]  I'm going to play that for everyone to hear.
[02:17:31.789 --> 02:17:38.789]   We'll hear arguments versus Million Number 95, 1065, Paul Schenck and Dwight Saunders
[02:17:38.789 --> 02:17:42.789]  versus Pro-Choice Network of Western New York.
[02:17:42.789 --> 02:17:44.789]  Reverend, did you hear that?
[02:17:44.482 --> 02:17:45.402]  I did.
[02:17:45.582 --> 02:17:48.304]  Was there a word missing that's different from what you put in your book?
[02:17:48.745 --> 02:17:49.485]  A title, yes.
[02:17:49.645 --> 02:17:50.426]  What was that title?
[02:17:51.346 --> 02:17:51.687]  Reverend.
[02:17:51.927 --> 02:17:52.928]  Reverend was not there.
[02:17:55.069 --> 02:17:55.269]  Right?
[02:17:56.310 --> 02:17:57.151]  Did you wink at your brother?
[02:17:58.612 --> 02:17:59.172]  I think I did.
[02:17:59.293 --> 02:18:01.995]  In fact, I think I actually hooked him.
[02:18:02.095 --> 02:18:02.355]  Oh wow.
[02:18:02.595 --> 02:18:03.716]  So now you got more details.
[02:18:03.736 --> 02:18:08.760]  You got the key detail wrong, what you were writing about in your book, but now you remember an additional detail.
[02:18:09.120 --> 02:18:11.282]  You not only winked, you elbowed your brother.
[02:18:11.302 --> 02:18:11.702]  I think I did.
[02:18:11.722 --> 02:18:18.448]  Even though the reason for the wink in your writing was the fact that Reverend was using the title something that had never been done, but it wasn't used.
[02:18:19.360 --> 02:18:20.761]  But we're supposed to believe you today.
[02:18:21.442 --> 02:18:23.703]  We're supposed to take your word over Justice Alito's word.
[02:18:23.884 --> 02:18:28.447]  We're supposed to take your word over a lady who gave you dollars, donated to your cause, Ms.
[02:18:28.467 --> 02:18:28.988]  Gayle Wright.
[02:18:29.548 --> 02:18:32.791]  You're disparaging her name, Justice Alito's name, and the court.
[02:18:33.151 --> 02:18:36.013]  And you have this, which obviously didn't happen.
[02:18:36.053 --> 02:18:40.177]  We got the transcript, we got the audio, but you made it a big deal in your book.
[02:18:40.277 --> 02:18:44.100]  One thing I've learned, people who mislead folks on small things, mislead them on big things.
[02:18:44.560 --> 02:18:45.020]  And you know what?
[02:18:45.620 --> 02:18:46.781]  You can you can lie in a book.
[02:18:46.841 --> 02:18:47.501]  It's not a crime.
[02:18:47.721 --> 02:18:48.762]  You can lie to the New York Times.
[02:18:48.782 --> 02:18:49.442]  That's not a crime.
[02:18:49.642 --> 02:18:54.564]  But when you come in front of Congress and you say things that are not true, you're not allowed to do that.
[02:18:55.204 --> 02:18:56.424]  You're not supposed to do that.
[02:18:56.985 --> 02:18:57.645]  And we have seen it.
[02:18:58.585 --> 02:18:59.746]  You're not supposed to do that.
[02:18:59.806 --> 02:19:00.146]  I yield.
[02:19:00.946 --> 02:19:02.066]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:19:02.086 --> 02:19:04.587]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:19:04.807 --> 02:19:07.188]  And today, I wasn't sure what I wanted to talk about.
[02:19:07.268 --> 02:19:13.165]   So the more I thought about it, the more I thought Why don't we get into some areas that are not very well known.
[02:19:13.505 --> 02:19:18.726]  And these are areas of control that keep people under the spell.
[02:19:19.726 --> 02:19:25.088]  Keep people in the wizard circle, so to speak, that do not allow them to wake up.
[02:19:25.568 --> 02:19:27.088]  And there's a lot of different facets to this.
[02:19:27.108 --> 02:19:29.949]  There's a lot of different techniques and mechanisms for control.
[02:19:29.989 --> 02:19:33.350]  But one thing that happens is that people don't know history.
[02:19:34.050 --> 02:19:44.292]   And if you know the way that education was manipulated and broken down in the 20th century, And then, obviously, even far worse now, the U.S.
[02:19:44.372 --> 02:19:52.498]  Western education system was modeled on the Prussian system, which was a highly compartmentalized and it was a command-and-control structure.
[02:19:52.559 --> 02:19:56.962]  So, it was a military-oriented structure for education.
[02:19:57.802 --> 02:19:58.863]  And the U.S.
[02:19:59.103 --> 02:20:04.768]  adopted that model, and this is discussed by Charlotte Isserbitt in her book, The Dumbing Down of America.
[02:20:06.349 --> 02:20:13.452]  Education became about socializing you and making sure that you fit into the system rather than you learning on your own.
[02:20:13.572 --> 02:20:17.994]  So ideally education should be you figuring out and learning how to learn.
[02:20:18.334 --> 02:20:19.435]  You become a critical thinker.
[02:20:19.955 --> 02:20:24.117]  You become the person who's able to research for themselves, critically think for themselves.
[02:20:24.750 --> 02:20:32.835]  But education became a system where it was all about socializing you to fit into the social order that they had planned.
[02:20:32.996 --> 02:20:44.923]  And the founders of American education in the sense of public schooling, Horace Mann, John Dewey, they were open socialists who thought that education, public education, would be the means to bringing this in.
[02:20:44.943 --> 02:20:56.328]   In fact, the founder of kindergarten, I think her name was a Mrs. Peabody, She believed that kindergarten and the public school system would be the vehicle for the kingdom of God to come.
[02:20:56.529 --> 02:21:05.034]  So she actually had these religious, almost Pentecost-level significances to the notion of public education.
[02:21:05.914 --> 02:21:14.840]  And all of that was by design, all of that was investigated in many different hearings and committees, and there's the Reese Committee and these kinds of things that discovered all of this.
[02:21:15.945 --> 02:21:20.527]  Well, one thing that's hidden from people's history, from people's approach, is history itself.
[02:21:20.567 --> 02:21:22.228]  People don't know anything about history.
[02:21:22.268 --> 02:21:29.151]  They don't know why it matters, and they don't understand that control structures use the same methods they've always used.
[02:21:29.851 --> 02:21:41.723]   And one example that I got a hold of many years ago, a very rare book that was out of print for a long time, that's very, very insightful, is this super duper Rare.
[02:21:41.743 --> 02:21:43.665]  And I don't even have the real copy.
[02:21:43.825 --> 02:21:47.728]  It's called The Origins of Intelligence Services by Francis Dvornik.
[02:21:48.929 --> 02:21:49.770]  And why does this matter?
[02:21:49.790 --> 02:22:02.719]  Well, he was a famous Catholic priest who wrote about how there's a deep relationship between even religious institutions, empire or imperial power, and spies.
[02:22:05.339 --> 02:22:12.581]  And so he talks about how, for example, the first great empire in the world, you go back to Egypt, he talks about Amenhotep.
[02:22:13.341 --> 02:22:24.383]  And he says that, uh, I don't know why he dates that as the first great empire, but he says Amenhotep's reign could never have come about and could never have sustained itself if he didn't have a vast spy network.
[02:22:25.823 --> 02:22:33.605]  And so you, and so you ancient world in Egypt, we don't, we don't usually think about spies in Egypt, but Egypt was full of spies.
[02:22:34.807 --> 02:22:42.152]  In fact, um, there was a false, uh, there was a notion of spycraft being connected to religion.
[02:22:42.172 --> 02:22:46.215]  It was almost like a secret society in the ancient Egyptian world.
[02:22:47.355 --> 02:22:56.642]  So we think about spies and we think about, uh, you know, this kind of stuff that we see in the news today with, with Russia gang and all that concocted nonsense, which was all fake and made up.
[02:22:57.442 --> 02:23:17.292]   And we still, we see masses of people still believe, right, that Russia got Donald Trump elected, that Russia Was putting bounties on soldiers in Afghanistan, that Russia was involved in Elon Musk and Twitter, Russia, Russia, Russia, it's all just constant the same nonsense, right?
[02:23:19.114 --> 02:23:41.936]   And we saw that the shutting down the Orthodox Church that Tucker covered, that Alex just covered as well, That was done at the behest of Zelensky, who we know is essentially one of these puppet figures put in to do the behest, to do the will of the Western power establishment.
[02:23:42.376 --> 02:23:48.278]  And I think everybody knows about the deep connections between Ukraine and Zelensky and Biden.
[02:23:48.798 --> 02:23:51.199]  Hasn't this come up quite a bit in the last several years?
[02:23:51.821 --> 02:23:52.582]  And what have we seen?
[02:23:52.662 --> 02:24:05.250]  Well, we're all vindicated once again that all of the Biden laptop and all that stuff was intentionally distracted, suppressed, hidden, people were deleted, people were suppressed just on Twitter.
[02:24:05.631 --> 02:24:08.313]  And we all knew that, but now we know for sure that that was the case.
[02:24:08.913 --> 02:24:11.355]  So there you have actual election meddling, right?
[02:24:13.056 --> 02:24:13.616]  Not by Russia.
[02:24:14.577 --> 02:24:26.378]   And yet this boogeyman is always propped up and it's just the most recent boogeyman at least probably since about 2014 or 15 they really started pushing the Russia boogeyman.
[02:24:27.438 --> 02:24:28.859]  Why is Russia the boogeyman?
[02:24:28.879 --> 02:24:34.180]  Well, Russia is the old rival to the Anglo-American power establishment.
[02:24:34.820 --> 02:24:35.800]  It's not the only one.
[02:24:35.920 --> 02:24:54.771]   There used to be the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Dr. Carol Quigley and his big massive Tome, Tragedy and Hope points out that the whole purpose of the 20th century, both the two World Wars and the Cold War, was to deplete, to exhaust, and to defeat the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Russia.
[02:24:55.271 --> 02:24:55.471]  That's it.
[02:24:56.924 --> 02:25:11.572]  And so we are still in this kind of a world power block setup where most of the world powers have conceded to Western so-called liberalism, which really isn't anything to do with Western civilization and it's really nothing to do with liberalism anymore.
[02:25:12.032 --> 02:25:17.474]  It's just sort of the apex of this, I guess we could call it nihilism, postmodernism, right?
[02:25:17.514 --> 02:25:26.279]  It's a postmodern nihilistic imperialism which is foisting all of its anti-human Malthusian ideology on the rest of the world.
[02:25:27.003 --> 02:25:27.944]  That's the root of all this.
[02:25:28.764 --> 02:25:40.091]  And so in recent books that I've covered, I covered, you know, this Milner Fabian book because it's such a great addendum to Quigley's works and to all these other geopolitical texts which say all the same stuff you hear me say all the time.
[02:25:41.172 --> 02:25:51.538]  And he notes that in the chapter concluding the institutions that were set up, all these institutions are public institutions.
[02:25:52.078 --> 02:25:54.320]  It's the Royal Institute for International Affairs.
[02:25:56.002 --> 02:25:59.324]  It's the League of Nations, which failed and was supplanted by the United Nations.
[02:26:00.284 --> 02:26:02.045]  It's the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:26:02.806 --> 02:26:05.207]  It's the British Labour Party.
[02:26:05.627 --> 02:26:06.648]  It's the World Bank.
[02:26:07.448 --> 02:26:13.351]  It's the IMF, Aspen Institute, Bilderberg, Trilateral Commission, Socialist International.
[02:26:13.511 --> 02:26:22.056]  All of these are interlinked by having the same inner core people promoting them from their inception.
[02:26:22.716 --> 02:26:34.878]   So basically the last century Is these people, including NATO, including what we typically think of as like ecumenism and the World Council of Churches.
[02:26:35.038 --> 02:26:46.881]  And so, do you understand that this is no different than the way control happened thousands of years ago in Egypt, according to Dvornik's big, fat history of intelligence services.
[02:26:47.281 --> 02:26:49.962]  The same model, it's the same way of trying to control things.
[02:26:51.451 --> 02:26:58.553]  And you have to understand this or else you will never direct your energy and your opposition to the right opponent.
[02:26:59.773 --> 02:27:11.677]  If I can get you to spend all of your energy and time over here fighting a fake straw man opponent, then I will win because you'll never go against the real opponent.
[02:27:12.672 --> 02:27:24.388]  And the right wing, for whatever reason, I don't know exactly why, conservatives, whatever you want to call them, probably because of the fake right wing, is the main reason why, the phonies, is why this never goes anywhere.
[02:27:25.008 --> 02:27:27.492]  They never can pinpoint the right opposition.
[02:27:27.712 --> 02:27:30.616]  And they can never pinpoint these institutions as the problem.
[02:27:31.326 --> 02:27:44.252]  And even most of those people still laugh at you when you talk about really existing institutions that have real power, that control and direct media, consult governments, think tanks, NGOs, right?
[02:27:44.512 --> 02:27:51.076]  You still get laughed at because they think that it's the idiots in the White House like Joe Biden.
[02:27:51.276 --> 02:27:52.476]  Look at that idiot, right?
[02:27:52.756 --> 02:27:53.877]  The idiots in the White House.
[02:27:53.917 --> 02:27:55.478]  Do you think that that guy's running anything?
[02:27:56.638 --> 02:27:58.039]  Now he might be a low level.
[02:27:59.608 --> 02:28:05.433]  Gangster that runs some things like in Ukraine, but he's not in control of all this.
[02:28:05.873 --> 02:28:12.038]  There was no Joe Biden a hundred years ago when they were laying the plans for the world that we're going into right now.
[02:28:12.738 --> 02:28:18.623]  And so until we recognize who is really calling the shots, nothing will ever change.
[02:28:19.663 --> 02:28:24.447]  And I don't know why conservative people can't figure this out, but they're their own worst enemies.
[02:28:24.567 --> 02:28:28.350]  People on the right and people that are conservatives, they can never pinpoint any of this stuff.
[02:28:29.353 --> 02:28:32.915]  And they just had the same tendency to just sort of mock and laugh at this stuff.
[02:28:32.995 --> 02:28:35.716]  And that will be the undoing, right?
[02:28:35.896 --> 02:28:38.277]  Mocking the facts will be the undoing.
[02:28:39.658 --> 02:28:42.139]  So we have to understand this or else things are never going to change.
[02:28:42.439 --> 02:28:50.063]  And I'm going to talk a little bit about a really heavy, heavy hitting podcast that I just did with some big name people a couple of days ago that went up.
[02:28:50.383 --> 02:28:52.084]  And I'm going to go into that when we go back.
[02:28:52.124 --> 02:28:53.025]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:28:53.045 --> 02:28:53.565]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:28:54.545 --> 02:28:55.546]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:28:55.566 --> 02:28:57.727]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:28:58.470 --> 02:29:13.137]  We were breaking down the steering committees, the NGOs, the think tanks, the groups that really control things, really set policy, really determine the course that the Western world in particular goes.
[02:29:13.757 --> 02:29:18.040]  And of course, that's now extending to global influence and global control.
[02:29:18.060 --> 02:29:33.671]   They're not completely there yet, but they're well on their way with Gigantic centralized banking institutions like the Bank for National Settlements, which was set up, according to Quigley, out of World War II, to be the central bank, the Federal Reserve Bank of all central banks in the world.
[02:29:34.051 --> 02:29:37.232]  And that's the real locus of control in this system.
[02:29:37.932 --> 02:29:42.594]  And that's why things like Bitcoin, for example, are a challenge to that because it's not centralized.
[02:29:42.894 --> 02:29:49.414]   It's not a system that they can very easily track and trace everybody's economic exchanges
[02:29:49.414 --> 02:29:54.253]  and interactions to shut that down.
[02:29:54.253 --> 02:29:58.933]   And the reason that this matters is that there's a history to what happened in the West that
[02:29:58.933 --> 02:30:02.293]   we have to understand as to how we got to where we are right now.
[02:30:02.293 --> 02:30:09.213]   How do we get to this phase of the implementation of a technocratic global governance, which
[02:30:09.213 --> 02:30:12.093]  is in its infancy phases right now in terms of rolling out?
[02:30:12.093 --> 02:30:16.253]   It's been planned for a long, long time by all those institutions that I listed.
[02:30:16.253 --> 02:30:22.373]   They openly talk about the implementation of an international order around these principles.
[02:30:22.374 --> 02:30:24.835]  And yes, technocracy goes back that long.
[02:30:24.855 --> 02:30:48.505]   It goes back to 1920s and 30s, when you had members of the Royal Society of the British Aristocracy, such as Lord Curtis, Lord Curzon, Lord Milner, all these people had adopted the early ideas of international Fabian socialism as the model and then only a few decades later people were already writing about futurism like H.G.
[02:30:48.525 --> 02:30:51.807]  Wells who was one of their ideologues, people like Bertrand Russell.
[02:30:51.908 --> 02:30:54.009]  I've covered that ad nauseum, I'm not going to repeat all that.
[02:30:54.670 --> 02:31:00.494]  But one of the ways that they go about this control is through spycraft, through spies and espionage.
[02:31:01.324 --> 02:31:02.926]  And this is also on record.
[02:31:02.966 --> 02:31:11.554]  There's a book called The Irregulars, which is about the British spies who were sent to America to talk the government structure in the U.S.
[02:31:11.614 --> 02:31:19.541]  into setting up a deep state, into setting up a spy apparatus, which had previously been done under the aegis of the military.
[02:31:20.579 --> 02:31:24.460]  Uh, now there was, there was even that was sort of corrupt with Woodrow Wilson and the inquiry.
[02:31:24.480 --> 02:31:39.945]  It was still, that was still, uh, basically a scheme of, uh, banking elites through Colonel Edwin Mandel house to set up the federal reserve and all that, but it became more centralized, more privatized after the national security act and the erecting of the OSS.
[02:31:40.426 --> 02:31:47.548]  And that was all done at the request of different British spies on how to set up an inner core, an inner secret group.
[02:31:48.374 --> 02:31:50.475]  That was modeled on British intelligence.
[02:31:51.015 --> 02:31:53.815]  So it's not British intelligence that runs everything.
[02:31:54.536 --> 02:32:01.758]  But the model of the CIA and the OSS and CIA is on the model of the structures of British intelligence and how they ran their empire.
[02:32:02.618 --> 02:32:14.521]  And a lot of these people, including people like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Lord Milner, all of these kinds of people in that structure, they wanted to reclaim America and its colonies back into the British imperial model.
[02:32:15.470 --> 02:32:20.653]  And even though Britain itself ended up kind of going bankrupt in the 20th century, it wasn't the model for that.
[02:32:23.915 --> 02:32:27.597]  They discovered that the United States could be the engine for that.
[02:32:27.937 --> 02:32:31.379]  The United States would be the engine of this inner core group.
[02:32:31.939 --> 02:32:34.601]  It's this same inner core group that is in control today.
[02:32:35.521 --> 02:32:43.265]  And they ally themselves with the elite, wealthy oligarchical families in the United States as well, such as the Rockefellers, JP Morgan, etc.
[02:32:43.625 --> 02:32:45.486]  These are the people that are really calling the shots.
[02:32:46.007 --> 02:32:55.732]  These are the people that have set up all of these institutions that are pushing and have been pushing for global governance for a hundred years or more.
[02:32:56.953 --> 02:33:01.435]  So it's amazing to me that we still can't talk about this.
[02:33:01.515 --> 02:33:03.256]  It's still not mainstream.
[02:33:03.276 --> 02:33:04.837]  You still can't mention these things.
[02:33:05.842 --> 02:33:08.384]  And that's all because of public perception.
[02:33:09.064 --> 02:33:13.607]  It's all because it's perceived still as tinfoil hat or crazy or something like that.
[02:33:14.367 --> 02:33:26.274]  Even though every one of these institutions that I've talked about is dedicated publicly in their founding charters and in their founding members ideology to the erecting of a global government.
[02:33:27.735 --> 02:33:32.157]  And I remember when I heard Alex talk about this 20 years ago, I thought, really?
[02:33:32.397 --> 02:33:34.959]  They really talk about doing this in their books?
[02:33:35.686 --> 02:33:44.971]  And I went and read all their books, not literally all of them, but we've lectured through almost probably 60 now of the writings of the elite and the white papers and all that.
[02:33:45.552 --> 02:33:50.695]  And you can absolutely bet that it's controlled, that it's planned, that it's structured.
[02:33:51.395 --> 02:34:01.001]  You know, one of the classic conspiracy texts that I never read for whatever reason over the years until fairly recently was John Coleman's Committee of the 300, right?
[02:34:02.387 --> 02:34:10.396]  The Conspirators Hierarchy and he's a person who was in British intelligence and then kind of later decided this was a bad plan.
[02:34:10.416 --> 02:34:16.262]  So he wrote this book about what their overall plan was and I think that came out in the 80s or 90s.
[02:34:16.322 --> 02:34:17.683]  So it's a pretty old text.
[02:34:18.604 --> 02:34:19.786]  But guess what he describes?
[02:34:20.626 --> 02:34:22.508]  Exactly the same thing that this describes.
[02:34:22.669 --> 02:34:24.130]  Exactly what Carol Quigley describes.
[02:34:24.170 --> 02:34:39.048]   Exactly what All of these texts describe, and until we realize that this is a hundred plus year plan that we are up against and institutions that have been erected for over a hundred years or so, nothing will change.
[02:34:39.729 --> 02:34:41.810]  Why can nobody seem to figure this out?
[02:34:41.870 --> 02:34:43.811]  Why can nobody pick this out?
[02:34:44.751 --> 02:34:51.443]   For example, if you look at something like the Vatican, I'm not trying to knock Catholics individually.
[02:34:51.463 --> 02:34:52.683]  I don't think there's anything.
[02:34:52.703 --> 02:34:59.945]  I don't hate or dislike Catholics individually, but I don't think the papacy and what's going on in Rome is anything healthy or any kind of good system.
[02:35:00.005 --> 02:35:01.445]  I think it's a control structure.
[02:35:02.085 --> 02:35:06.607]  And certainly Francis has really shown this in many, many ways.
[02:35:08.287 --> 02:35:18.250]  But if we go back to the time of the League of Nations, which was already a nascent form of world government, the Pope at that time, his name was Benedict XV, he was a huge supporter of the League of Nations.
[02:35:20.333 --> 02:35:27.276]  Well, why would the Papacy be a huge supporter of the control structure of the people that I'm talking about?
[02:35:27.837 --> 02:35:38.682]  And this control structure has no desire whatsoever to have a place for religions operating in some sort of independent sphere or independent domain.
[02:35:38.702 --> 02:35:39.322]  You understand that?
[02:35:40.054 --> 02:35:45.656]  For example, the ecumenist movement was really bankrolled by the Rockefeller family itself.
[02:35:45.816 --> 02:35:50.118]  This is detailed at length in the Collier and Horowitz biography of the Rockefellers.
[02:35:51.418 --> 02:36:02.822]  There's a whole chapter on how they put all the money into the ecumenist movement and got it going, and that blossomed into things like the World Council of Churches, the National Council of Churches.
[02:36:03.422 --> 02:36:06.863]  Those are entities really created by the Rockefellers on record.
[02:36:08.968 --> 02:36:17.754]  Was that because they were just altruistic and they want everyone to be happy and they want to give everybody a nice, feel-good Christianity?
[02:36:17.774 --> 02:36:37.944]   Well, in a way, that is the case because they believe that the social gospel, which was a rejection of actual Christianity on the basis of miracles and these kinds of things, that a social gospel would be an excellent tool To spread their version of what America is supposed to be, which is for them, Americanism is oligarchy, right?
[02:36:38.084 --> 02:36:42.589]  Their Americanism, not the, you know, founding principles, nothing like that.
[02:36:43.409 --> 02:36:51.697]  It's a socialized, it's a Christianity turned into an NGO as an organ of soft power.
[02:36:52.429 --> 02:37:13.204]  And there's been entire books by historians written on how the Rockefellers bought off all of the Protestant seminaries, how they turned them into these liberal organizations by offering to build million-dollar buildings and putting in their ministers and people that they hand-picked to teach the next generation of Protestant pastors.
[02:37:13.951 --> 02:37:19.193]  And they did the exact same thing eventually with Roman Catholic seminaries and Roman Catholic schools in the United States.
[02:37:19.213 --> 02:37:23.315]  There's a giant book written by a Catholic on that by David Wimhoff on John Courtney Murray.
[02:37:24.156 --> 02:37:28.858]  And that's because there's been a long alliance between the CIA and the Jesuits in this same power structure.
[02:37:30.278 --> 02:37:30.819]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:37:30.859 --> 02:37:31.799]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:37:31.819 --> 02:37:37.242]  We're breaking down the real secret history of how the power structure controls the West.
[02:37:37.682 --> 02:37:38.282]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:37:38.809 --> 02:37:39.830]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:37:39.850 --> 02:37:42.191]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:37:42.211 --> 02:37:44.272]  We're talking about dialectics.
[02:37:44.332 --> 02:37:45.833]  We're talking about manipulation.
[02:37:45.853 --> 02:37:54.658]  We're talking about control structures and the organizations that are in place to enforce this control, to steer society, to social engineer society.
[02:37:54.718 --> 02:37:58.680]  And there was a book I read many years ago that really opened my eyes up to this.
[02:37:59.721 --> 02:38:04.784]  And I do not agree with everything from this author, but this book itself alone is really good.
[02:38:06.121 --> 02:38:12.726]  And this is by a kind of controversial figure, but he's one of the key figures in founding the American homeschool movement.
[02:38:12.766 --> 02:38:16.069]  I don't know if this book is still in print, but his name was R.J.
[02:38:16.149 --> 02:38:18.391]  Rushton, and he wrote a book called The One and the Many.
[02:38:18.651 --> 02:38:29.280]  And the reason The One and the Many is a really good book is because it's about this manipulation of the collective versus the atomized individual over time in different civilizations.
[02:38:30.652 --> 02:38:45.127]  And so he works his way all the way up to the modern era, and he talks about how societies kind of fall over into tyrannies, or they fall over into anarchy, and they kind of have this back-and-forth dialectic, a manipulated false either-or, is what I mean by dialectic.
[02:38:46.169 --> 02:39:10.547]   And he gets all the way up into the 20th century, and he mentions the Principles in Pope John XXIII's encyclical Pacem in Terris, which if you go to my YouTube channel, I went, I recently lectured through a lot of these texts because they're also very important to the modern era because he was one of the first popes, he's the pope that called Vatican II back in the 60s, to call for world government.
[02:39:11.387 --> 02:39:21.587]   call for a centralized body to help control and structure international commerce, international government.
[02:39:21.587 --> 02:39:28.746]   And that was, I think, in the 1960s, it's 1963, I think is when he did that encyclical,
[02:39:28.746 --> 02:39:30.746]  it's right around that time.
[02:39:30.746 --> 02:39:34.066]  And Rush Ginn has a really good commentary on that.
[02:39:34.066 --> 02:39:41.586]   He talks about how they admittedly wanted this to be something akin to the United Nations ideology
[02:39:41.586 --> 02:39:43.186]  of a global government.
[02:39:43.186 --> 02:39:49.786]   And it's actually mentioned that they supported certain radical Bolsheviks and socialists.
[02:39:50.053 --> 02:40:01.582]  John XXIII at the United Nations presented a copy of this encyclical to U Thant, who was a Leninist at the United Nations.
[02:40:02.663 --> 02:40:27.489]  Here are the people that are supposedly the absolute enemies of Christianity, the Bolsheviks, the Socialists, the Communists, the Marxists, the Soviets, and you have this idea of John XXIII that we can have this union, this synthesis between the East and the West to have some sort of alliance between basically Satan and Christ, right?
[02:40:27.529 --> 02:40:29.710]  I mean, how is it possible to have this kind of alliance?
[02:40:31.204 --> 02:40:36.087]  And this is what was undergirding a lot of the ideas of the ecumenism of that time.
[02:40:36.647 --> 02:40:49.674]  Now, I'm not saying John XXIII was some asset per se of the CIA, but the point is that there's higher level people above these organizations, because we know at this time the CIA wanted to use the Roman Catholic Church as part of their doctrinal warfare program.
[02:40:50.934 --> 02:40:51.995]  But there's people higher than that.
[02:40:52.015 --> 02:40:56.497]  There's people above those kinds of government entities.
[02:40:56.557 --> 02:41:05.603]   There's foundations and there's families that have wealth Far beyond that, that are also very interested in creating things like a world religion.
[02:41:08.225 --> 02:41:11.268]  And so, how do we get to this end goal?
[02:41:11.368 --> 02:41:21.517]  I mentioned a podcast that I recently did, an in-studio podcast with a couple heavy hitters, Dr. James Lindsay, who you may have seen on Joe Rogan.
[02:41:21.557 --> 02:41:25.901]  He's been on Joe Rogan many times to cover the issue of fake peer-reviewed science.
[02:41:26.927 --> 02:41:37.934]  And I was on that with him and another high-level guy who's named Stephen Coughlin, and he was for many years a consultant, I think, to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Pentagon consultant.
[02:41:38.134 --> 02:41:40.376]  He's sort of the Pentagon's expert on Islam.
[02:41:41.277 --> 02:41:48.941]  And so we sat down and had this, he himself is a Catholic, Lindsey is an agnostic, and we had about a three-hour conversation on this topic.
[02:41:49.482 --> 02:41:52.604]  How is society controlled through manipulated dialectics?
[02:41:53.522 --> 02:42:05.934]  And that Rush Uni book is central to this because it helps us understand that power structures have known for millennia that you can control groups through creating factions and creating division.
[02:42:06.775 --> 02:42:11.819]  And we only need to think in terms of modern era of somebody like Zbigniew Brzezinski who wrote in his books about doing this.
[02:42:11.940 --> 02:42:22.681]   He wrote about the, in one of his last books, Strategic Vision, Brzezinski wrote about the Manichaean dialectic of the Cold War.
[02:42:23.081 --> 02:42:30.824]  The theologically God-based West and the atheist, socialist-based East.
[02:42:30.964 --> 02:42:35.706]  And even though Brzezinski was part of that Cold War structure, he speaks of this kind of as a dialectic.
[02:42:36.867 --> 02:42:41.648]  Not really that real, it was just sort of manipulated and it was said to be this kind of a thing, right?
[02:42:42.788 --> 02:42:59.732]  And I'm not saying there wasn't a real Cold War, I'm just saying that there was a long-term goal by the people who are the Fabian Socialists in these higher level institutions that I'm talking about, who didn't have a problem with big capitalism like some of the other Marxists did.
[02:43:00.792 --> 02:43:12.674]   Some of the more radical Marxists, some of the groups of Marxists that We're pretty hardcore, didn't have this adapt and, you know, alliance with the institution's attitude that the Fabians had.
[02:43:12.714 --> 02:43:14.475]  And so that they were much more successful.
[02:43:15.175 --> 02:43:21.057]  And that's why so many of these power elite really preferred Fabian socialism, including David Rockefeller himself.
[02:43:21.677 --> 02:43:29.780]  David Rockefeller studied under Lasky, I think at Harvard, who was a Fabian socialist, part of the Milner group here that we're talking about.
[02:43:30.692 --> 02:43:35.616]  And he also studied under Von Hayek, who in Von Hayek at the end of his book calls for global government.
[02:43:35.636 --> 02:43:36.577]  I don't know if people know.
[02:43:36.617 --> 02:43:39.720]  If you read Road to Serfdom, yeah, there's got a lot of great points in there.
[02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.122]  But the very last chapter is, let's have a global government.
[02:43:43.243 --> 02:43:44.204]  It's an appendix in the book.
[02:43:44.244 --> 02:43:46.386]  I don't know why people can't, libertarians can't figure this out.
[02:43:48.387 --> 02:43:54.973]  It's at the end of the day, if you're somebody like David Rockefeller, Fabian socialism and libertarian economics, they meet at the hip.
[02:43:55.453 --> 02:44:09.401]   They're fine because On the one hand, it allows David Rockefeller to maintain a position of monopoly capital, while at the same time funding every possible socialist, Maoist, right, type of organization out there.
[02:44:10.181 --> 02:44:20.249]  And so when I sat down with Dr. James Lindsay and Stephen Coughlin, both who are, you know, really smart, brilliant people, we had a great exchange over this notion of dialectics.
[02:44:21.082 --> 02:44:35.305]  And the thesis that we came to in that podcast was that the people that are conservative or libertarian or right-wing or whatever in America just cannot figure out how they're manipulated through dialectics.
[02:44:36.805 --> 02:44:41.306]  And I don't just mean the false left-right parties, right?
[02:44:41.346 --> 02:44:43.907]  I mean, we know that there's RINOs and there's Democrats, okay?
[02:44:43.927 --> 02:44:45.407]  But it's more than that.
[02:44:46.527 --> 02:44:53.605]   This is a technique of Manipulation and control that is studied in a scientific way.
[02:44:54.305 --> 02:44:57.947]  There was a whole institute, a whole group called the Frankfurt School.
[02:44:59.328 --> 02:45:04.151]  And I studied under somebody who studied under the Frankfurt School when I was in undergrad and grad school.
[02:45:04.211 --> 02:45:08.934]  So I have Marxistolic succession, as I like to say, because I don't mean that literally.
[02:45:08.954 --> 02:45:11.996]  I just mean that I studied under somebody who's studying under Habermas.
[02:45:13.051 --> 02:45:15.394]  And so, I know what the Frankfurt School teaches.
[02:45:15.434 --> 02:45:27.987]  I've read multiple Habermas books, and this is an institute that the West brought over, the Frankfurt School, the OSS brought the Frankfurt School people over to weaponize and study the arts to fight World War II.
[02:45:29.489 --> 02:45:31.091]  And that became also part of the Cold War.
[02:45:32.489 --> 02:45:38.350]  And this is partly where you get this idea of modern art and that being a CIA weapon during the Cold War.
[02:45:38.670 --> 02:45:43.451]  But this is not really about communism and Soviets and this kind of stuff, right?
[02:45:43.491 --> 02:45:47.312]  This is actually about controlling society on a mass scale.
[02:45:48.953 --> 02:45:50.393]  It's not about Cold War, ultimately.
[02:45:50.413 --> 02:45:55.494]  It's about degrading and breaking down society, and the arts are one of the key ways that they do that.
[02:45:56.525 --> 02:45:58.206]  And this has been known for a long time.
[02:45:58.266 --> 02:46:00.007]  I don't know why people cannot figure this out.
[02:46:00.027 --> 02:46:01.447]  I've talked about this for so long.
[02:46:01.487 --> 02:46:09.330]  I wrote two books on this, trying to convey this point, trying to explain to people that the arts are not just organic things that, you know, creative people do.
[02:46:09.390 --> 02:46:10.811]  They're control structures.
[02:46:10.851 --> 02:46:12.772]  They don't have to be, but they are.
[02:46:14.172 --> 02:46:16.013]  And the establishment has known that for a long time.
[02:46:16.893 --> 02:46:18.074]  In fact, the ancient world knew that.
[02:46:19.068 --> 02:46:23.749]  When Virgil wrote the Aeneid, he wrote it to be the propaganda myth of the Roman Empire.
[02:46:24.349 --> 02:46:28.850]  When Edmund Spencer wrote the Fairy Queen, he wrote it to be the propaganda myth, like the Aeneid, for the British Empire.
[02:46:30.611 --> 02:46:30.991]  On record.
[02:46:33.571 --> 02:46:39.652]  And so they know that the stories, the arts, help prop up, or can damage, the power structure.
[02:46:39.672 --> 02:46:46.574]  The system, which is based around power relations, obviously, how it views the arts as well.
[02:46:47.700 --> 02:46:53.183]  And so it's going to be pretty much pretty concerned, I would say, with how to control and manipulate society, don't you think?
[02:46:53.803 --> 02:46:58.866]  And that's why dialectics, dialectical manipulation, plays into this.
[02:46:59.046 --> 02:47:13.597]   And so in the last segment, I'm going to go further into dialectical manipulation, how this actually comes out of secret societies, how this comes out of Western hermeticism, alchemy, And exactly what we talked about in that three-hour podcast.
[02:47:13.637 --> 02:47:22.080]  I'm going to try to break it down in the last 10 minutes for you guys to help you understand so that you don't get manipulated by false dialectics that goes beyond party politics.
[02:47:22.921 --> 02:47:24.241]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:24.281 --> 02:47:25.302]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[02:47:25.362 --> 02:47:37.126]  Today's analysis we're talking about dialectics as warfare, dialectics as a technique and technology of control, dialectics as a science of Marxist praxis.
[02:47:37.226 --> 02:47:38.787]  All of these things are real things.
[02:47:39.466 --> 02:47:46.749]  That exists amongst the academics, amongst the intellectuals, amongst those who are in power as a tool of control.
[02:47:47.549 --> 02:47:50.190]  Now, not everybody in the power structure, for sure, is a Marxist.
[02:47:50.530 --> 02:47:50.971]  That's true.
[02:47:51.591 --> 02:48:01.695]  But one thing that the right-wing and conservatives have never, yeah, exactly, have never understood is that the people that they're opposed to, they do study philosophy.
[02:48:02.155 --> 02:48:03.156]  They do know these things.
[02:48:03.656 --> 02:48:04.656]  They know them very well.
[02:48:05.637 --> 02:48:09.118]  And they know them as a way to weaponize these things.
[02:48:09.910 --> 02:48:11.612]  And so you hear me using these terms.
[02:48:11.652 --> 02:48:12.712]  I'm not making these up.
[02:48:12.753 --> 02:48:13.293]  These are terms.
[02:48:13.333 --> 02:48:13.713]  Look at this.
[02:48:13.753 --> 02:48:16.376]  Here's the people of the Frankfurt School right here.
[02:48:16.396 --> 02:48:18.037]  Horkheimer and Adorno.
[02:48:18.137 --> 02:48:20.179]  You see that book, Dialectic of Enlightenment.
[02:48:20.859 --> 02:48:21.840]  That's dialectics.
[02:48:22.621 --> 02:48:23.502]  What is dialectics?
[02:48:23.562 --> 02:48:25.443]  Well, it goes back to the ancient world.
[02:48:25.543 --> 02:48:29.747]  And it's this idea of either ors or thesis and negation.
[02:48:30.868 --> 02:48:41.796]   And so for these Marxists, and I did a lecture some years ago on this book by Habermas, who is, again, one of the more famous, more recent Marxist Frankfurt School of Critical Theory people.
[02:48:42.376 --> 02:48:43.976]  This one's called Theory and Praxis.
[02:48:44.717 --> 02:48:46.137]  Praxis is action.
[02:48:46.797 --> 02:48:52.218]  Praxis is you actually working to negate and tearing down the existing structures.
[02:48:53.579 --> 02:49:05.482]  And you have to understand that they believe this because it is negation is actual part of the process to enact Marxism or to enact revolutionary consciousness.
[02:49:06.718 --> 02:49:09.419]  And who do you think he goes to when he talks about this?
[02:49:09.539 --> 02:49:13.220]  He goes to Hegel and Gnosticism and Hermeticism.
[02:49:14.060 --> 02:49:17.500]  And he says that this is the old version of what we're doing today.
[02:49:19.901 --> 02:49:22.382]  And it's not a Marxist conspiracy per se.
[02:49:22.442 --> 02:49:23.222]  It's beyond that.
[02:49:23.462 --> 02:49:24.682]  It's more than that.
[02:49:25.062 --> 02:49:27.723]  It's an anti-human satanic conspiracy, yes.
[02:49:28.983 --> 02:49:32.724]  But it utilizes weapon systems from different philosophers.
[02:49:33.817 --> 02:49:36.920]  And I don't know why, again, conservatives and right-winger people can't figure this out.
[02:49:36.940 --> 02:49:37.380]  They just can't.
[02:49:37.400 --> 02:49:39.062]  They think velocity doesn't matter.
[02:49:39.102 --> 02:49:40.743]  That's for dumb academics or whoever.
[02:49:41.524 --> 02:49:46.989]  And we'll just keep pushing, I don't know what they think, things that don't work.
[02:49:47.689 --> 02:49:51.392]  Because they can't identify dialectics and dialectical manipulation.
[02:49:52.633 --> 02:49:53.915]  Who else do you think he goes to in this?
[02:49:53.955 --> 02:49:55.736]  He says, let's look at people like Hegel.
[02:49:56.257 --> 02:49:57.318]  What was Hegel teaching?
[02:49:57.358 --> 02:49:58.859]  Well, here's a famous academic book.
[02:49:59.933 --> 02:50:04.616]  From a couple years ago by Glenn McGee called Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition.
[02:50:06.617 --> 02:50:07.798]  Hegel was a Hermeticist.
[02:50:09.158 --> 02:50:12.720]  Now it's true that the philosophers of today are not Hegelian.
[02:50:13.481 --> 02:50:16.763]  But if you know about Hegel, you know that Karl Marx read Hegel.
[02:50:17.723 --> 02:50:18.844]  He was a young Hegelian.
[02:50:19.724 --> 02:50:23.186]  And then he flipped Hegel on his head and said, get rid of all this spirit stuff.
[02:50:23.666 --> 02:50:26.148]  It's all just dialectical material process.
[02:50:27.154 --> 02:50:29.295]  And Habermas says, yes, that's correct.
[02:50:29.835 --> 02:50:42.259]  And in order to have a part of this warfare, dialectical conflict process, every true Marxist, every person involved in revolutionary action must constantly negate, go against, tear down, fight.
[02:50:43.179 --> 02:50:44.660]  Remember, what is it, Saul Alinsky?
[02:50:45.080 --> 02:50:48.941]  In the beginning of his book, Rules for Radicals, he dedicates the book to Satanism, to Satan.
[02:50:50.177 --> 02:50:58.100]  They're saying the same thing Habermas says, saying the same thing that the dialect of enlightenment people are saying from the Frankfurt School.
[02:50:58.140 --> 02:51:02.862]  These are the people that the OSS brought over to weaponize the arts.
[02:51:04.062 --> 02:51:09.845]  This is not dumb academics in universities just theorizing into oblivion.
[02:51:10.045 --> 02:51:16.887]  These are people brought over by the intelligence apparatus to change this culture, to change the West.
[02:51:17.588 --> 02:51:18.128]  And they did it!
[02:51:18.929 --> 02:51:21.110]  And right-wingers and conservatives can't figure this out.
[02:51:22.991 --> 02:51:23.251]  Why?
[02:51:23.271 --> 02:51:25.592]  It's well known.
[02:51:26.072 --> 02:51:26.572]  It's right here.
[02:51:26.992 --> 02:51:28.293]  It's in their freaking books.
[02:51:31.414 --> 02:51:36.256]  He says it is a technology of control and manipulation.
[02:51:36.276 --> 02:51:40.278]  It doesn't have to do with, it's not, Hegel doesn't even matter himself.
[02:51:42.779 --> 02:51:45.340]  Because they're just using ideas out of these different philosophers.
[02:51:46.670 --> 02:51:48.131]  You say, who cares what Habermas says?
[02:51:48.651 --> 02:51:52.073]  He's just some European, weird intellectual person.
[02:51:52.133 --> 02:51:52.654]  No, he's not!
[02:51:52.734 --> 02:51:53.834]  He wrote a book with the Pope!
[02:51:55.015 --> 02:51:56.696]  The supposed conservative Pope!
[02:52:00.078 --> 02:52:06.182]  Benedict XVI together with Jürgen Habermas.
[02:52:09.184 --> 02:52:10.484]  And what do you think that book is about?
[02:52:11.025 --> 02:52:13.086]  Well, it's about secularization and all this kind of stuff.
[02:52:13.126 --> 02:52:14.507]  The dialectics, do you see that?
[02:52:17.666 --> 02:52:21.347]  Maybe, if all of these people are talking about dialectics, maybe it's something that you should be aware of.
[02:52:22.508 --> 02:52:25.188]  Especially if you're some conservative person, right-wing person.
[02:52:28.229 --> 02:52:30.890]  And it's about control, it's about manipulation, right?
[02:52:31.050 --> 02:52:35.051]  So even if you're not interested in all this highfalutin academic stuff, that's fine, I don't blame you.
[02:52:35.551 --> 02:52:37.212]  It's all kind of ridiculous at the end of the day.
[02:52:37.808 --> 02:52:41.670]  But it's not ridiculous when it becomes a weaponized tool of control.
[02:52:42.210 --> 02:52:44.031]  And that's what we got into in that podcast.
[02:52:44.151 --> 02:52:48.513]  And I've talked with, you know, two of the smartest guys out there on this topic.
[02:52:49.174 --> 02:52:51.735]  You go to my YouTube channel, you'll see it as the top video right there.
[02:52:51.775 --> 02:52:58.539]  Me and Dr. James Lindsay, Stephen Coughlin, and Courtney Turner, we talk about how dialectics is a tool of control.
[02:52:58.639 --> 02:53:07.480]   And this is the, this is, we think, The chief point of failure that right-wing and conservative people cannot recognize.
[02:53:07.760 --> 02:53:19.106]  They can't figure this out, and even though they might have begun to figure it out, they're just sort of waking up out of a sleep when it comes to false dialectics in the party.
[02:53:20.067 --> 02:53:20.967]  Oh, there's rhinos!
[02:53:21.527 --> 02:53:23.368]  But it's much bigger than rhinos, you see.
[02:53:24.189 --> 02:53:26.090]  It's false choices and false dialectics.
[02:53:26.630 --> 02:53:29.091]  It's even in terms of events that occur, right?
[02:53:29.111 --> 02:53:30.212]  So let's say an event occurs.
[02:53:31.050 --> 02:53:38.417]  The media is there to construct the circle within which you can't go outside of that circle to ask questions or to explain any event.
[02:53:39.818 --> 02:53:42.941]  Doesn't matter what, Zelensky, 9-11, whatever.
[02:53:42.981 --> 02:53:48.966]  You're only allowed to ask the questions within this circle, and the media constructs that circle for you.
[02:53:49.347 --> 02:53:53.731]  And as long as you're in the circle, Stephen Coughlin says, you're under the spell.
[02:53:55.606 --> 02:54:02.847]  Because you'll never identify what's really going on because the questions outside of the circle are considered questions that aren't even askable.
[02:54:03.667 --> 02:54:05.008]  They're not even real questions.
[02:54:06.068 --> 02:54:10.229]  There was a famous philosopher who was a little more conservative in the 20th century who wrote about this.
[02:54:10.269 --> 02:54:11.229]  His name was Eric Vogelin.
[02:54:12.069 --> 02:54:23.071]  And Eric Vogelin said that technocracy in the modern era and scientism structures the questions such that there are certain questions that can and cannot be asked.
[02:54:25.091 --> 02:54:26.051]  That's what I'm talking about.
[02:54:26.091 --> 02:54:27.352]  That's the manipulation of dialect.
[02:54:27.392 --> 02:54:32.393]  That's how you can't ask, wait a minute, what if scientism itself isn't true?
[02:54:32.413 --> 02:54:35.534]  Well, that's not, you can't ask that question.
[02:54:35.574 --> 02:54:40.316]  You can't challenge Bill Nye and, you know, all these kinds of pop science figures.
[02:54:43.217 --> 02:54:47.118]  Why do you, for example, says philosophy is useless.
[02:54:47.338 --> 02:54:48.398]  We're done with philosophy.
[02:54:48.438 --> 02:54:50.099]  Don't ask philosophical questions anymore.
[02:54:50.692 --> 02:54:54.934]  Because he, I don't know how well he knows, but he doesn't want you to look at these kinds of things.
[02:54:55.514 --> 02:55:04.873]   dialectics and the frankfurst goal right i've still got a bit of a cold so i apologize
[02:55:05.080 --> 02:55:07.721]  So that's why I'm having to drink water.
[02:55:07.742 --> 02:55:14.428]   But I mean, so when it comes to hermeticism and dialectics and this kind of stuff, This is how we're controlled.
[02:55:14.568 --> 02:55:16.069]  This is what we have to understand.
[02:55:16.089 --> 02:55:18.310]  If we don't understand that, nothing's ever going to change.
[02:55:18.931 --> 02:55:31.518]  The overall agenda of technocracy will march on forward while we're over here arguing about, you know, politicians peeing on people and sleeping with people and the latest.
[02:55:31.758 --> 02:55:41.424]  And again, I'm not saying that, you know, big events like that aren't worth talking about, but a lot of these things don't matter and people won't be even remembering them in a few years.
[02:55:43.055 --> 02:55:45.097]  And they're disposable events, right?
[02:55:46.298 --> 02:55:51.822]  Meanwhile, the technocracy marches forward through manipulated dialectics.
[02:55:52.883 --> 02:55:53.584]  It never stops.
[02:55:54.805 --> 02:55:57.887]  And the right-wing conservative people can never figure it out.
[02:55:58.448 --> 02:56:03.472]  And they'll just forever talk about the next stupid scandal with Biden or whoever.
[02:56:04.238 --> 02:56:12.486]  And I understand that, to a degree, the scandals matter because they show cover-ups, they show, you know, suppression of information and people getting censored and deleted.
[02:56:12.526 --> 02:56:13.327]  Yeah, I understand that.
[02:56:14.870 --> 02:56:17.871]  But nothing will change until we identify the real problems.
[02:56:18.311 --> 02:56:26.293]  I think on that new podcast that I did, that we did, we did identify the problems and we spent about three hours discussing this.
[02:56:26.433 --> 02:56:33.035]  And so until intelligent, conservative people figure this out, they're going to be impotent to do anything.
[02:56:33.555 --> 02:56:38.356]  And I mean, other people have seemed to be figuring this out, too, in terms of researchers noting that.
[02:56:38.416 --> 02:56:42.357]  How is it that the conservative and the right wing people can never do anything?
[02:56:44.096 --> 02:56:48.777]  It's like they're always constantly conceding ground and becoming more and more liberal, that Overton window.
[02:56:48.937 --> 02:56:50.978]  Well, that's part of this dialectical process.
[02:56:51.038 --> 02:56:58.159]  So if you've wondered why it is that conservatives become more and more liberal over time, it is through the manipulation of dialectics.
[02:56:58.699 --> 02:56:59.239]  This is why.
[02:57:00.179 --> 02:57:04.680]  And until conservatives decide to figure this out, they're going to keep conceding ground and keep losing.
[02:57:05.720 --> 02:57:08.161]  Cultural war, political war, geopolitical, all this stuff.
[02:57:09.421 --> 02:57:10.701]  So you have to understand dialectics.
[02:57:10.721 --> 02:57:12.002]  Go check out my new podcast.
[02:57:12.062 --> 02:57:23.003]   By the way, I'm almost Almost ready to release the next lecture on this geopolitical stuff in terms of the Milner-Fabian book, so look for that in this upcoming week.
[02:57:23.443 --> 02:57:27.485]  That's going to be another hard-hitting lecture with a lot of information.
[02:57:27.525 --> 02:57:29.305]  You can also get my books at the website.
[02:57:29.546 --> 02:57:36.668]  I have a new 600-page book out that I wrote that's really just a summation of all my essays over the last 10 years.
[02:57:37.328 --> 02:57:38.089]  It's the Red Book.
[02:57:38.389 --> 02:57:42.050]  You can also get my philosophy book, which is an introduction to philosophy called Metanarratives.
[02:57:42.694 --> 02:57:46.277]  Also go to Alex's, I have my Alex book in here.
[02:57:46.297 --> 02:57:50.581]  Yeah, this is a good book too, which I was happy to get a few weeks ago.
[02:57:50.621 --> 02:57:51.602]  You might check this book out.
[02:57:51.622 --> 02:57:54.064]  You get this in the InfoWars store and help keep Alex on the air.
[02:57:54.704 --> 02:57:56.726]  This says everything that I'm saying as well.
[02:57:57.346 --> 02:58:09.346]  Thank you.
[02:58:09.413 --> 02:58:12.814]  Here's the clip of the poor business owner who they're trying to bankrupt.
[02:58:13.254 --> 02:58:17.355]  I own a restaurant, and as you guys know, food costs are sky high.
[02:58:18.075 --> 02:58:21.476]  How restaurants are surviving right now is by alcohol sales.
[02:58:21.716 --> 02:58:25.497]  You guys just doing your job is facilitating what's going on in this country right now.
[02:58:26.977 --> 02:58:33.457]   You shut down a man's livelihood for not following COVID mandates that didn't do anything, anything
[02:58:33.457 --> 02:58:34.457]  to prevent COVID.
[02:58:34.457 --> 02:58:36.816]  And it was actually detrimental to the community.
[02:58:36.816 --> 02:58:42.576]   I spent a lot of my adult life overseas fighting against dictatorships.
[02:58:42.576 --> 02:58:47.816]   And the last thing that I was going to do was come home to my country and allow a dictatorship
[02:58:47.816 --> 02:58:49.336]  to rule right here.
[02:58:49.336 --> 02:58:53.336]   The reason that we're in the situation we're in as the United States of America, you're
[02:58:53.336 --> 02:58:54.377]  part of the problem, sir.
[02:58:54.727 --> 02:59:00.891]  I realized early on that these COVID mandates were more about control than they were our health and safety.
[02:59:01.372 --> 02:59:03.934]  It set our kids back so many years, these mandates.
[02:59:04.434 --> 02:59:06.455]  It set small businesses back so many years.
[02:59:06.796 --> 02:59:08.517]  It destroyed small businesses, man.
[02:59:08.577 --> 02:59:09.157]  It destroyed them.
[02:59:09.417 --> 02:59:11.979]  I did the only thing I know how to do, fight back by not complying.
[02:59:12.720 --> 02:59:22.227]  And that's when, fast forward to last Friday, the ABC agents and the Virginia State Police raided my restaurant and took everything from me.
[02:59:24.267 --> 02:59:25.688]  And that's how we got to where we're at.
[02:59:27.148 --> 02:59:29.349]  So you can't complain about what the President's doing.
[02:59:29.389 --> 02:59:32.370]  You can't complain about the state that the country's in right now.
[02:59:32.771 --> 02:59:34.751]  You can't complain about how screwed up it is.
[02:59:35.212 --> 02:59:36.332]  You're part of the problem, sir.
[02:59:36.732 --> 02:59:37.853]  You're just doing your job.
[02:59:38.913 --> 02:59:43.375]  So many people were just doing their job for Hitler back in Germany.
[02:59:44.615 --> 02:59:45.896]  You as well, sir.
[02:59:45.976 --> 02:59:46.916]  That goes for you as well.
[02:59:47.596 --> 02:59:48.457]  That goes for you as well.
[02:59:48.477 --> 02:59:49.257]  That goes for all of you.
[02:59:50.228 --> 02:59:56.831]  Once they suspended my health department license for not following COVID mandates, that automatically suspended my ABC license.
[02:59:57.011 --> 02:59:57.952]  So that's how I lost it.
[02:59:59.192 --> 03:00:05.935]  Anyway, we went to court for my health department license, and I beat the Virginia Department of Health in court.
[03:00:06.596 --> 03:00:09.797]  They asked the judge to shut me down, and the judge ruled in my favor.
[03:00:10.678 --> 03:00:11.778]  It destroyed families.
[03:00:12.198 --> 03:00:13.419]  It destroyed our community.
[03:00:14.159 --> 03:00:15.340]  And it destroyed our country.
[03:00:16.499 --> 03:00:18.421]  And nobody in here gives a damn about that.
[03:00:18.441 --> 03:00:19.522]  They're just doing their job.
[03:00:20.283 --> 03:00:21.824]  I'd be lying if I told you it was easy.
[03:00:21.864 --> 03:00:22.465]  It's not easy.
[03:00:22.645 --> 03:00:29.191]  I mean, I'm going into my third Christmas now, not knowing what's in store for me in the future.
[03:00:29.531 --> 03:00:30.872]  So you're part of the problem, man.
[03:00:31.012 --> 03:00:31.773]  I want you to know that.
[03:00:31.813 --> 03:00:32.634]  You're part of the problem.
[03:00:36.337 --> 03:00:37.398]  You're part of the problem.
[03:00:38.019 --> 03:00:39.620]  Everybody in here, every one of you, man.
[03:00:39.720 --> 03:00:41.162]  What's going on in this country right now?
[03:00:41.567 --> 03:00:47.250]  What they're trying to do is beat me into submission and make me kneel in that corner and kiss their ring and give up.
[03:00:47.551 --> 03:00:48.451]  But I'm not going to.
[03:00:49.011 --> 03:00:50.452]  I don't care how much it costs me.
[03:00:50.472 --> 03:00:52.133]  I don't care how much time it takes.
[03:00:52.413 --> 03:00:53.474]  I will continue to fight.
[03:00:53.914 --> 03:00:56.856]  And I promise you, if you fight with me, we will win.
[03:00:57.116 --> 03:00:58.457]  We'll eventually come out on top.
[03:00:58.877 --> 03:01:00.098]  And we will save Virginia.
[03:01:00.178 --> 03:01:03.180]  And in turn, we will save the United States of America.
[03:01:03.600 --> 03:01:08.183]  But please stop complying with these unconstitutional and illegal mandates.
[03:01:08.743 --> 03:01:14.826]  That's why it's important to support little businesses, and it's why out of all the places to support, it's us folks.
[03:01:15.326 --> 03:01:17.107]  I'm in personal bankruptcy, so is InfoWars.
[03:01:17.127 --> 03:01:21.389]  We can stay on air, but we need funds to go through the bankruptcy and stabilize, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:01:21.669 --> 03:01:24.550]  It's a reorganization to stay on air, and they can't shut us down.
[03:01:24.910 --> 03:01:26.011]  Their goal is to shut us down.
[03:01:26.351 --> 03:01:27.932]  Please go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:01:28.132 --> 03:01:31.794]  We have free shippings back on orders for $50 or more, discounted shipping below $50.
[03:01:32.894 --> 03:01:37.277]  We have Vitamin Mineral Fusion, DNA Force Plus, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[03:01:37.297 --> 03:01:38.758]  They're going to sell out very, very soon.
[03:01:39.139 --> 03:01:40.319]  That's how we fund the operation.
[03:01:40.379 --> 03:01:43.221]  Plus, these are very empowering, amazing products.
[03:01:43.442 --> 03:01:46.083]  Supramel Vitality, your libido, your stamina, it's incredible.
[03:01:46.404 --> 03:01:49.105]  We're in your hands to stay on air at this critical time.
[03:01:49.146 --> 03:01:52.148]  Our most important work is happening now and is to come.
[03:01:52.788 --> 03:01:58.357]  But I'm at peace about this, but don't let me prove how much we needed funds by us shutting down.
[03:01:58.397 --> 03:01:59.959]  I need you to go to mfulworthstore.com.
[03:01:59.979 --> 03:02:03.845]  I need you to get great products you already need today, and I really appreciate your support.
