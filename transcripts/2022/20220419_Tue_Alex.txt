[00:00.000 --> 00:17.360]  It's Tuesday, April 19th, Patriots Day.
[00:17.360 --> 00:26.720]  Infowars, Tomorrow's News, Today.
[00:26.720 --> 00:30.880]  The world is in a three-fold economic collapse by design.
[00:30.880 --> 00:38.320]  Every major institution that is good and wholesome has been either overthrown or infiltrated
[00:38.320 --> 00:40.800]  and destroyed.
[00:40.800 --> 00:49.560]  And here we are, ladies and gentlemen, on the verge of all these different programs
[00:49.560 --> 00:54.800]  and operations we witnessed, only getting worse.
[00:54.800 --> 01:02.360]  And this is happening because the public is politically illiterate, culturally illiterate
[01:02.360 --> 01:06.120]  when it comes to understanding what the social engineers are doing.
[01:06.120 --> 01:11.200]  I am simply here trying to get people to become aware of the globalist agenda and to understand
[01:11.200 --> 01:16.320]  that a lot of people unwittingly go along with it via peer pressure, even though it's
[01:16.320 --> 01:19.800]  going to destroy them in the end.
[01:19.800 --> 01:27.040]  The corporate press, going along with censorship and authoritarian policies in the economy,
[01:27.040 --> 01:30.200]  is now seeing the biggest layoffs in its history.
[01:30.200 --> 01:37.520]  Web streaming services like Netflix and Hulu are all plunging in their subscriptions.
[01:37.520 --> 01:42.840]  The depression is going to hurt everybody, including the useful idiots that have gone
[01:42.840 --> 01:46.040]  along with it and cheerly did it.
[01:46.040 --> 01:49.720]  There's a lot of people pretending they're part of the globalist elite when they're not.
[01:49.720 --> 01:55.720]  And even the globalists themselves are fools for going along with this agenda, this anti-human
[01:55.720 --> 01:56.720]  agenda.
[01:56.720 --> 02:05.480]  And many of them now realize that, but this juggernaut has been set into motion.
[02:05.480 --> 02:10.600]  So we've got a big broadcast for you lined up today, the very special guest of the second
[02:10.600 --> 02:16.320]  hour, Dr. Lee Merritt, we're going to be looking at the IMF slashing the global forecast into
[02:16.320 --> 02:21.080]  depression territory and predicting mass starvation will intensify.
[02:21.080 --> 02:22.080]  That's a no-brainer.
[02:22.080 --> 02:27.320]  We've got three big factors, which are about to make the coming food shortages even worse.
[02:27.320 --> 02:36.440]  We have the good news with the TSA and the federal court ruling and the by-demonstration
[02:36.440 --> 02:41.960]  being faced with the fact that the public is not buying into their COVID hysteria anymore,
[02:41.960 --> 02:47.040]  having to back off the mask mandate, which is the symbol of silencing the public, the
[02:47.040 --> 02:55.360]  symbol that were diseased and evil and bad, and the symbol of basically our surrender
[02:55.360 --> 02:57.720]  to a bio-medical tyranny.
[02:57.720 --> 03:05.440]  Here's a few clips of pilots and the sturduses and people cheering as the news was discovered
[03:05.440 --> 03:12.440]  mid-flight yesterday.
[03:12.440 --> 03:22.880]  I just want to say that you guys, if you would like to take them off, you can, if you want
[03:22.880 --> 03:23.880]  to keep them on, you can, okay?
[03:23.880 --> 03:27.520]  April 18th, the Biden administration announced that the Transportation Security Administration
[03:27.520 --> 03:32.360]  will no longer enforce the federal mandate requiring mass in all U.S. airports and on-board
[03:32.360 --> 03:39.360]  aircraft.
[03:39.360 --> 03:59.040]  All right, so that's a few clips from different flights around the country when the news came
[03:59.040 --> 04:03.240]  in at about one o'clock central yesterday.
[04:03.240 --> 04:07.080]  We broke the news here with Judge Andrew Napolitano on air with us.
[04:07.080 --> 04:11.800]  So this looks like a victory on the surface and it is, but remember the fact that we've
[04:11.800 --> 04:17.280]  put up with several years of this theater and this fraud and this hysteria and the fact
[04:17.280 --> 04:21.760]  that the teachers unions and the, and Hollywood and all of them want to aggressively keep mask
[04:21.760 --> 04:28.400]  on our children, but not even on themselves, is just a sign of this power cult and what
[04:28.400 --> 04:29.960]  they're trying to do.
[04:29.960 --> 04:32.400]  They want to cover our faces.
[04:32.400 --> 04:38.400]  They want to train us to live basically under a form of biomedical Sharia law and it must
[04:38.400 --> 04:39.400]  and will stop.
[04:39.400 --> 04:45.400]  Meanwhile, over in China, things have gotten even more nightmarish and dystopic with their
[04:45.400 --> 04:46.400]  ongoing lockdown.
[04:46.400 --> 04:51.760]  Now, 400 million under intense lockdown, the giant martial law drill for the ages.
[04:51.760 --> 04:52.760]  That's coming up as well.
[04:52.760 --> 05:03.560]  We'll be on the side, big broadcast lined up for you today is about 25 years ago that
[05:03.560 --> 05:04.960]  I wanted to expand in Fort Worth.
[05:04.960 --> 05:09.240]  I've been on the air a couple of years, but I only had money to finance my own simple little
[05:09.240 --> 05:10.240]  local radio show.
[05:10.240 --> 05:12.600]  I wanted to hire camera people, I wanted to make films.
[05:12.600 --> 05:15.840]  I wanted to really challenge the globalist and it was a t-shirt.
[05:15.840 --> 05:21.960]  I designed the first one mass murderers agreed gun control works that helped us finance hiring
[05:21.960 --> 05:23.440]  the first two members of my group.
[05:23.440 --> 05:25.760]  That's our oldest design and we still selling.
[05:25.760 --> 05:30.800]  We have that design over a hundred others that will now all be limited editions because
[05:30.800 --> 05:32.600]  whatever stock we've got in that's it.
[05:32.600 --> 05:36.920]  We're selling everything out to find the operation to get rid of inventory.
[05:36.920 --> 05:39.080]  We'll still have some teachers in the future.
[05:39.080 --> 05:40.880]  They'll just be limited editions and short runs.
[05:40.880 --> 05:46.160]  So if you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last team on almost forgotten.
[05:46.160 --> 05:50.000]  We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.
[05:50.000 --> 05:55.680]  Every ball cap, every flat, every hoodie, every long sleeve, every t-shirt, regular shirts,
[05:55.680 --> 06:08.240]  designer shirts, they're all selling at cost infowarstore.com.
[06:08.240 --> 06:14.040]  It's Tuesday, April 9th, 2022 Patriots Day.
[06:14.040 --> 06:22.840]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[06:22.840 --> 06:29.520]  In defiance to tyranny and the World Economic Forum, the UN, the New World Order, big tech,
[06:29.520 --> 06:36.360]  the censors, the pedophile satanic left, in battle but stronger than ever, vindicated.
[06:36.360 --> 06:37.440]  We are the info war.
[06:37.440 --> 06:39.200]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[06:39.200 --> 06:47.120]  Well, if you look over in China, 400 million people are under total martial law meltdown,
[06:47.120 --> 06:51.200]  not allowed to go to work, not allowed to farm, not allowed to produce, already creating
[06:51.200 --> 06:55.640]  massive famines in China and around the world.
[06:55.640 --> 07:02.080]  Now 400 million are locked down, only intensifying this is the New World Order in action.
[07:02.080 --> 07:11.080]  Students in Shanghai have been locked down for a month and this is video of them singing
[07:11.080 --> 07:18.280]  and basically having a group party between tower blocks and the police are running around
[07:18.280 --> 07:24.360]  telling them that they'd better stop all of this and exercise in turning your country
[07:24.360 --> 07:37.560]  into a prison and China is the model to turn the entire earth into a prison planet.
[07:37.560 --> 07:42.360]  This is what they have in store for all of us.
[07:42.360 --> 07:49.520]  This is in the Rockefeller Plan operation lockstep and China is a giant laboratory where
[07:49.520 --> 07:53.080]  they created the virus, where they released the virus.
[07:53.080 --> 08:00.400]  Now all of us are suspect, all of us are bad guys except the biomedical government corporate
[08:00.400 --> 08:03.280]  fascist system.
[08:03.280 --> 08:04.280]  And that's what this is.
[08:04.280 --> 08:08.000]  If you're a radio listener, you're not seeing this, images of elementary students going to
[08:08.000 --> 08:16.000]  school in their biomedical hazmat suits, all complete total theater, really massively abusing
[08:16.000 --> 08:19.920]  these poor little children into this tyranny.
[08:19.920 --> 08:25.760]  But remember a few months ago, here in the U.S., the mandates were getting lifted by
[08:25.760 --> 08:29.080]  different states saying no, we're not going to make elementary students wear masks when
[08:29.080 --> 08:35.200]  the masks don't work and zero children are dying from this lab-made bio-weapon.
[08:35.200 --> 08:38.600]  They were cheering and extremely happy when they got the news.
[08:38.600 --> 08:51.400]  Starting tomorrow, we don't have to wear masks anymore.
[08:51.400 --> 08:56.920]  This has all been an exercise, country by country, by the technocracy from Australia
[08:56.920 --> 09:04.200]  to the U.S., from Canada to Germany, from China to South Africa, from Mexico to Brazil,
[09:04.200 --> 09:10.920]  from the U.K. to France, to see how we'll behave and see what we'll put up with and
[09:10.920 --> 09:15.480]  see what we will submit to and to see how we can be censored and controlled and outside
[09:15.480 --> 09:19.760]  gatherings banned and medical doctors and scientists saying that the vaccine doesn't
[09:19.760 --> 09:22.360]  work and is dangerous, being restricted.
[09:22.360 --> 09:28.480]  All of it was a beta test for the next big move that's coming.
[09:28.480 --> 09:32.080]  And that's why we're tomorrow's news today, next year's news today.
[09:32.080 --> 09:36.560]  We have shown you out of the EU, out of the U.N., out of Canada, out of the U.S. where
[09:36.560 --> 09:40.040]  the bureaucrats are planning it at the end of this year or next year.
[09:40.040 --> 09:41.040]  They're bringing it back.
[09:41.040 --> 09:45.280]  It's the post-industrial world, the build back better, cutting off the pipelines, cutting
[09:45.280 --> 09:51.800]  off the energy, cutting off the food, destroying the infrastructure to bring in the worldwide
[09:51.800 --> 09:56.560]  collapse, which they will then blame on global warming and the depopulation on global warming
[09:56.560 --> 10:03.400]  and the new diseases on global warming when it's all being man-made.
[10:03.400 --> 10:07.360]  This is the extinction rebellion writ large by this cult.
[10:07.360 --> 10:12.040]  And if you're not aware of the environmental transhumanist terror cult, you are like a blind
[10:12.040 --> 10:15.280]  person hiking in the mountains, you're going to fall off the edge of a cliff.
[10:15.280 --> 10:21.400]  But if you have the understanding of the real agenda and who your enemy is, we can all be
[10:21.400 --> 10:24.240]  aware of it and transcend it before it's too late.
[10:24.240 --> 10:27.880]  Humanism is an authoritarian police state, they are deeply under its control.
[10:27.880 --> 10:32.760]  But we have our systems and our checks and balances, we're not perfect, but that's what
[10:32.760 --> 10:35.280]  we've been able to say, no to this fraud and stop it.
[10:35.280 --> 10:40.560]  But notice where it's a biomedical dictatorship, it never ends because it's designed to never
[10:40.560 --> 10:41.560]  end.
[10:41.560 --> 10:48.760]  It's designed to carry out the orderly collapse of society, the post-industrial world.
[10:48.760 --> 10:53.000]  You hear build back better, it means destroy civilization and build their technocracy on
[10:53.000 --> 10:54.000]  your ashes.
[10:54.000 --> 10:58.280]  You saw the school children months ago celebrating here in the U.S.
[10:58.280 --> 11:05.480]  Here is the pilot, the flight attendant, and folks cheering on planes yesterday afternoon
[11:05.480 --> 11:10.200]  when the news came across that the federal government, a judge had said, you don't have
[11:10.200 --> 11:12.120]  to wear a face covering anymore.
[11:12.120 --> 11:16.280]  You think, oh, this is great, but imagine how far our mighty republic has fallen that
[11:16.280 --> 11:17.920]  we ever put up with this in the beginning.
[11:17.920 --> 11:18.920]  Here it is.
[11:18.920 --> 11:25.920]  I just wanted to read that to you guys, so if you would like to take them off, you can.
[11:25.920 --> 11:31.920]  If you want to keep them on, you can, okay?
[11:31.920 --> 11:36.920]  It is over, immediately.
[11:36.920 --> 11:37.920]  Congratulations.
[11:37.920 --> 11:43.320]  April 18th, the Biden administration announced that the Transportation Security Administration
[11:43.320 --> 11:48.120]  will no longer enforce the federal mandate requiring mass in all U.S. airports and on-board
[11:48.120 --> 11:49.120]  aircrafts.
[11:49.120 --> 11:50.120]  Finally!
[11:50.120 --> 11:55.120]  Perfectively, immediately, mass are optional for all airport employees, crew members and
[11:55.120 --> 12:03.120]  customers outside U.S. airports and on-board aircrafts.
[12:03.120 --> 12:04.600]  All right, so there you go.
[12:04.600 --> 12:05.600]  We're going to go to break.
[12:05.600 --> 12:09.840]  I'm going to come back with the military news, the economic news, that's really serious.
[12:09.840 --> 12:13.360]  And the electric car news, they're announcing basically nobody's going to make gasoline
[12:13.360 --> 12:16.360]  cars for 2026.
[12:16.360 --> 12:21.640]  And so much more, we've got a big broadcast lined up for you today.
[12:21.640 --> 12:25.600]  Also more and more pregnancies between two women in prisons when it's really a biological
[12:25.600 --> 12:32.200]  man and pregnant women turning the prisons into basically birthing centers.
[12:32.200 --> 12:33.200]  That's coming up as well.
[12:33.200 --> 12:38.640]  But I want to just make, again, an announcement about what's happened the last 24 hours.
[12:38.640 --> 12:42.440]  The corporate media and the Democratic Party law firms who admit they want to bankrupt
[12:42.440 --> 12:48.680]  us and shut us down have lied and said that we have all these tens of millions of extra
[12:48.680 --> 12:53.000]  dollars because they got all our financials and then they misrepresent them and say,
[12:53.000 --> 12:57.160]  look, 16 million went out of the company, yeah, to buy product and they know that.
[12:57.160 --> 13:01.280]  So they go, he's got secret 16 million hiding, none of it's true.
[13:01.280 --> 13:07.760]  And so I did limited chapter 11 so that a federal judge can send a trustee in and see
[13:07.760 --> 13:13.640]  the books and force this out in the open because I believe the lawyers are lying to the Sandy
[13:13.640 --> 13:18.360]  Hook parents who've already had the big paydays with Remington and the lawsuits and the big
[13:18.360 --> 13:21.760]  charities they have, but that they want the First Amendment now as well, the lawyers and
[13:21.760 --> 13:23.840]  the groups around them.
[13:23.840 --> 13:27.240]  And so it's just not true.
[13:27.240 --> 13:31.520]  And so I'm like, you know what, we'll just do chapter 11 so that this is all evidence.
[13:31.520 --> 13:36.320]  So regardless of whatever rigged stuff they do with these juries or whatever, in the end
[13:36.320 --> 13:41.040]  it'll go back to the federal court and reality will set in.
[13:41.040 --> 13:45.600]  That said, I talked about this yesterday, there's been a lot of press interest in it
[13:45.600 --> 13:49.440]  so I'm going to get it out in the next day or so with a special report.
[13:49.440 --> 13:55.040]  In Texas they have filed and the judges said yes for a million dollar sanction on me where
[13:55.040 --> 13:58.360]  you get your attorney's fees before there's even a trial.
[13:58.360 --> 14:02.600]  You're guilty and they decide how guilty you are with a jury and you get the attorney's
[14:02.600 --> 14:08.760]  fees before that, it's never before been done, in law, illegal.
[14:08.760 --> 14:09.880]  Judge says they don't care.
[14:09.880 --> 14:15.320]  That's how wild the liberal leftist weaponized judiciary is and it gets worse.
[14:15.320 --> 14:20.120]  It says when we are in the kangaroo trial, we cannot talk about the First Amendment
[14:20.120 --> 14:26.040]  or anything and have no defense, basically we'll have to wear duct tape over our faces.
[14:26.040 --> 14:29.840]  And this is what they're doing and they're setting a precedent for everyone else.
[14:29.840 --> 14:36.000]  This is what authoritarians do and when you see the whole corporate press celebrating
[14:36.000 --> 14:42.360]  it and saying, yeah, shut the hell off, it's because they see me as the archetypal Americanum
[14:42.360 --> 14:43.360]  populist.
[14:43.360 --> 14:49.600]  That's how they see me and that's because they hate you and they hate all of us and
[14:49.600 --> 14:54.640]  they hate flyover country and they hate Christians and they hate capitalists and they hate successful
[14:54.640 --> 14:56.960]  people and they're a cult.
[14:56.960 --> 15:01.400]  And so of course they hate me because I'm strong and I'm a little spoken and I'm truthful
[15:01.400 --> 15:05.920]  and I have love in my heart and you love me back and you're amazing as well and they want
[15:05.920 --> 15:11.040]  to try to silence us and I'll assure you're not going to silence me, ladies and gentlemen,
[15:11.040 --> 15:13.160]  because you will never let them silence me.
[15:13.160 --> 15:17.120]  You will always take my information and the reports, no matter what happens if they kill
[15:17.120 --> 15:20.920]  me or put me in prison, you won't let them silence me because you're not going to be
[15:20.920 --> 15:22.240]  silence yourself.
[15:22.240 --> 15:26.520]  So I salute you and I thank you, but I want to encourage you to understand we are maxed
[15:26.520 --> 15:30.600]  out here and we need money to go through this bankruptcy and the rest of the stuff and we
[15:30.600 --> 15:31.600]  will continue on.
[15:31.600 --> 15:35.200]  You've got that pledge for me, but I need your help now or you're basically giving up
[15:35.200 --> 15:36.200]  in the fight to these people.
[15:36.200 --> 15:40.560]  I need you to go to infowarstore.com and get Rainforest Ultra back in stock.
[15:40.560 --> 15:45.640]  We got a flash sale on our amazing bone broth with the Chaga Mushroom and a really high quality

[16:03.160 --> 16:08.000]  We need to sell those shirts to fund the operation, but we'd already made some orders on future
[16:08.000 --> 16:10.280]  shirts coming in, but these are all limited editions.
[16:10.280 --> 16:13.080]  So once these new shirts come in, we're going to sell those and that's it.
[16:13.080 --> 16:17.280]  We'll have limited editions one at a time in the future and when they're gone, they're
[16:17.280 --> 16:18.280]  gone.
[16:18.280 --> 16:19.840]  Well, here's the new limited edition shirt.
[16:19.840 --> 16:21.480]  This one is $24.95.
[16:21.480 --> 16:22.480]  Really nice fabric.
[16:22.480 --> 16:26.920]  Alex Jones was right on the front with a big red lightning bolt on the back infowars.com.
[16:26.920 --> 16:30.520]  You talk about triggering, you talk about spreading the word, you talk about waking
[16:30.520 --> 16:31.520]  people up.
[16:31.520 --> 16:32.520]  Alex Jones was right.
[16:32.520 --> 16:33.520]  Fundraiser shirt.
[16:33.520 --> 16:36.520]  We need the funds to operate infowarstore.com.
[16:36.520 --> 16:37.800]  Alex Jones was right.

[16:56.000 --> 16:59.840]  on the back available now for limited time infowarstore.com.
[16:59.840 --> 17:02.480]  You know, it's a fact and I'm not bragging when I say it.
[17:02.480 --> 17:08.640]  It's just true that info wars is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty
[17:08.640 --> 17:17.120]  as the logo of human populist resistance against their transhumanist anti human program.
[17:17.120 --> 17:23.800]  And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever
[17:23.800 --> 17:24.800]  done.
[17:24.800 --> 17:30.920]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them at infowarstore.com

[17:34.120 --> 17:38.760]  And so now we need to support more than ever because this fight has intensified.
[17:38.760 --> 17:42.320]  Don't need me to tell you that at infowarstore.com.
[17:42.320 --> 17:46.320]  We've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now.

[18:10.440 --> 18:15.480]  defenses, your immune system, while at the same time, funding the info war.
[18:15.480 --> 18:20.000]  Other immune systems have always been critical, but in this globalist era, with all the criminal
[18:20.000 --> 18:24.440]  activity they're involved in, it is more important than ever to take the tools God gave us and
[18:24.440 --> 18:26.640]  supercharge our immune systems.

[19:00.200 --> 19:01.560]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[19:01.560 --> 19:03.480]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[19:03.480 --> 19:04.480]  Welcome.
[19:04.480 --> 19:05.480]  Hello Alex.
[19:05.480 --> 19:06.480]  Yes Malcolm.
[19:06.480 --> 19:07.480]  All right.
[19:07.480 --> 19:09.480]  I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the line.
[19:09.480 --> 19:11.480]  Hello Alex.
[19:11.480 --> 19:15.640]  I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer, SuperMell Vitality
[19:15.640 --> 19:17.240]  and Brainforce Plus.
[19:17.240 --> 19:18.240]  Mix those two together.
[19:18.240 --> 19:19.760]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[19:19.760 --> 19:21.760]  SuperMell Vitality really, really works.
[19:21.760 --> 19:27.960]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up and so it has
[19:27.960 --> 19:33.160]  a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions that also work quite well but just aren't as
[19:33.160 --> 19:34.160]  strong.
[19:34.160 --> 19:35.160]  This is like a very fine wine.
[19:35.160 --> 19:37.680]  In fact, each batch is different.
[19:37.680 --> 19:39.720]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[19:39.720 --> 19:43.000]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as
[19:43.000 --> 19:44.000]  strong?
[19:44.000 --> 19:45.000]  That's just how it is.
[19:45.000 --> 19:46.000]  It's how it works.
[19:46.000 --> 19:47.320]  So it's always good.
[19:47.320 --> 19:51.480]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong but yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a
[19:51.480 --> 20:01.160]  decent price then this is it.
[20:01.160 --> 20:27.560]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:27.560 --> 20:32.600]  The border patrol estimates are only capturing about one in eight that come across the southern
[20:32.600 --> 20:41.160]  border and last year alone they captured 700 plus thousand, almost 800,000.
[20:41.160 --> 20:42.640]  You can do the math on that.
[20:42.640 --> 20:47.620]  That's almost 7 million people total and we have official numbers out today that's coming
[20:47.620 --> 20:51.160]  up next segment but let me just hit this information for you.
[20:51.160 --> 20:54.840]  Here's the live show headline today and I'm going to get into the articles themselves.
[20:54.840 --> 21:00.480]  Tuesday live, International Monetary Fund slashes global economic outlook, confirms
[21:00.480 --> 21:03.000]  depression, mass starvation, imminent.
[21:03.000 --> 21:07.880]  Now they've run these operations around the world and put countries into debt and implode
[21:07.880 --> 21:13.600]  their economies by design and third world countries then go from being developed countries
[21:13.600 --> 21:20.000]  into being undeveloped or basically slave colonies and there's been many congressional
[21:20.000 --> 21:21.000]  hearing on it.
[21:21.000 --> 21:24.440]  There's been books written on it, Economic Hitman, John Perkins.
[21:24.440 --> 21:26.240]  That's what they're doing.
[21:26.240 --> 21:30.920]  Three factors which are about to make coming food shortages even worse, zero hedge does
[21:30.920 --> 21:36.760]  an excellent job laying it all out with the confluence of circumstances create a perfect
[21:36.760 --> 21:44.400]  storm for global food production and the perfect storm of what's happening there.
[21:44.400 --> 21:51.200]  A lot of people have been pointing out that if you look at this we have people like Bill
[21:51.200 --> 22:01.560]  Gates who's always the consulate insider positioning himself well before the next crisis and two
[22:01.560 --> 22:06.720]  years ago it turned out he was buying up farmland all over the world and I said watch, these
[22:06.720 --> 22:12.600]  lockdowns are going to cause food shortages and he'll be positioned to then grow GMO and
[22:12.600 --> 22:14.080]  basically force you to eat it.
[22:14.080 --> 22:20.520]  Well here's a point that the folks on Twitter resist O5 had to say, Bill Gates is the largest
[22:20.520 --> 22:23.920]  investor in vaccines and there's a pandemic.
[22:23.920 --> 22:27.800]  Bill Gates is the largest owner of land in America and there's a food crisis.
[22:27.800 --> 22:32.560]  Bill Gates is the largest investor in renewables and there's an oil shortage and they're forcing
[22:32.560 --> 22:35.040]  you on to them.
[22:35.040 --> 22:37.760]  So here are some of the factors.
[22:37.760 --> 22:43.920]  We've got the war in Ukraine, we've got 400 million people in China that are under the
[22:43.920 --> 22:51.080]  lockdowns and we have massive fertilizer shortages all over the world and now bird flu is the
[22:51.080 --> 22:56.880]  worst it's ever been wiping out bird flocks across the planet.
[22:56.880 --> 23:01.560]  Forget about a soft landing, what's the shape of the hard landing and it's an excellent
[23:01.560 --> 23:07.680]  article also at Zero Edge that lays it out and let's just put it to you this way.
[23:07.680 --> 23:13.640]  It's not fun when you go to the doctor and you learn you got cancer, bad cancer and that's
[23:13.640 --> 23:17.280]  what we've got and then a lot of people in their lives will learn, hey you got terminal
[23:17.280 --> 23:22.320]  cancer you'll be dead in six months and usually they're right.
[23:22.320 --> 23:30.760]  So we had to get our affairs in order as I've always said I'm a canary in the coal mine
[23:30.760 --> 23:35.360]  and that's why when you see us being taken down and really having big problems that's
[23:35.360 --> 23:41.840]  just an indicator of the fact that the whole body's sick and you don't need me to tell
[23:41.840 --> 23:46.440]  you this but we're going to look back like I said two years ago on two years ago was
[23:46.440 --> 23:50.640]  a good time we're going to look back on today was a good time and I don't say that to scare
[23:50.640 --> 23:55.680]  you I say because you better get right with God and you better get ready now while you
[23:55.680 --> 24:01.640]  still can't because this has been an artificial program this is what the post industrial world
[24:01.640 --> 24:10.320]  looks like in George Herbert Walker Bush and Rio de Janeiro in 1992 30 years ago did not
[24:10.320 --> 24:14.680]  sign on to that treaty to do this by 2030 for no reason and they said they would launch
[24:14.680 --> 24:22.520]  the collapse in 2020 in agenda 21 and they would complete it by 2030.
[24:22.520 --> 24:27.320]  So you're going to look back at 2022 is a great year 2023 is a great year compared to
[24:27.320 --> 24:32.240]  each new year that is going to crescendo you can see the trajectory I'm getting chills
[24:32.240 --> 24:36.960]  you can see the trajectory of tyranny is going straight up and it just exponentially is going
[24:36.960 --> 24:43.320]  to get worse and if we wake up to the new world order and if we wake up to the globalists
[24:43.320 --> 24:47.600]  this could be their waterloo and they could be removed and imprisoned and punished and
[24:47.600 --> 24:53.280]  it'll be this great tyranny we defeated we'll learn from it but if folks don't make this
[24:53.280 --> 25:00.040]  the central issue at their churches and at their legislatures and at their businesses
[25:00.040 --> 25:06.520]  it's over and the good news is my mom went to a big mega church in the round rock with
[25:06.520 --> 25:14.960]  friends this this Sunday on Easter and she said the place was so full it had overflowing
[25:14.960 --> 25:20.480]  big jumbo trons the parking lot and that the preacher was talking about the new world
[25:20.480 --> 25:24.960]  order and the takeover and everybody's got to get ready and dug in and get prepared
[25:24.960 --> 25:29.520]  and how the covid was nothing but a power grab and I'm hearing that from listeners and
[25:29.520 --> 25:38.480]  I'm hearing that from family all over the place good good yes absolutely so we need
[25:38.480 --> 25:43.080]  this information to become ubiquitous we use information to be known everywhere so people
[25:43.080 --> 25:48.880]  understand who's doing it I know I know I harp on that we've got better than a good
[25:48.880 --> 25:52.880]  chance of we're aware of this stopping it we will there's no way the hell on earth that's
[25:52.880 --> 25:58.240]  going to be unfolding will continue if the people doing it are known and know they're
[25:58.240 --> 26:02.480]  going to get in trouble they can only do this by stealth and that's why they want to gas
[26:02.480 --> 26:06.120]  like you while they are going to set up there at the Davos group bragging how they're doing
[26:06.120 --> 26:10.080]  it to you but sensor everybody with big tech that talks about it here in America and go
[26:10.080 --> 26:15.080]  man senator ran Paul's crazy he's talking about the great reset all that Alex Jones
[26:15.080 --> 26:23.360]  that trigger Carlson that Josh Holly when we're talking about the real threat if you
[26:23.360 --> 26:26.720]  like the Ukrainians could they win a war if they don't was Russians they were fighting
[26:26.720 --> 26:31.360]  or didn't know what was going on no you've got to know what you're up against and that's
[26:31.360 --> 26:36.680]  a very elementary but I just showed you articles yesterday all over the news Washington Post
[26:36.680 --> 26:43.640]  New York Times Financial Times of London Bloomberg saying we need dictators it's time to have
[26:43.640 --> 26:47.960]  dictators it's time to get rid of freedom it's time to get rid of free speech and then
[26:47.960 --> 26:57.000]  hot I'm not hundreds excuse me I'm a lot of you thousands of articles with just ecstasy
[26:57.000 --> 27:04.200]  laden happiness that oh Alex Jones could be shut down oh Alex Jones in his empire can
[27:04.200 --> 27:10.160]  be taken down oh Alex Jones is urban he's got all that money and they just lie and talk
[27:10.160 --> 27:17.400]  about product we bought and the money we paid for it as extra money look this money went
[27:17.400 --> 27:22.920]  down where did it go well where we fund ourselves we we buy product that's how we fund 90 plus
[27:22.920 --> 27:27.560]  percent of operation it was like where did where did the 16 million though he's got it
[27:27.560 --> 27:32.000]  in his pocket no it went to product to sell it to then fund our operation so they count
[27:32.000 --> 27:37.080]  the money going in and out between the supplement company my dad's got in fours life and in four
[27:37.080 --> 27:42.720]  wars and then they call that profit and of course they know it's not profit and we wish
[27:42.720 --> 27:50.000]  it was we wouldn't be begging for support but again and the very people going along
[27:50.000 --> 27:54.280]  with this are gonna wake up in a destroyed country with total crime and no birthright
[27:54.280 --> 27:59.200]  of freedom anymore and no due process but they don't care because they've lost touch
[27:59.200 --> 28:04.400]  with God they're lost people and the fact that the courts everywhere are this corrupt
[28:04.400 --> 28:08.600]  not all of them but more and more there's just outrageous judicial tyranny no one denies
[28:08.600 --> 28:14.200]  that is emblematic of everything else that's coming down so people ask me constantly how
[28:14.200 --> 28:18.160]  do you take it how do you deal with it how do you and I'm like we're all on the same
[28:18.160 --> 28:24.920]  sinking ship how am I taking it do you understand what's going on here this is the planned world
[28:24.920 --> 28:29.440]  collapse do you know what it's gonna look like it's gonna look bad you think crime exploding
[28:29.440 --> 28:33.960]  already sped you think the border collapses bad yet you think inflation is bad yet folks
[28:33.960 --> 28:39.520]  the new world order did every bit of this the central banks did every bit of this and
[28:39.520 --> 28:43.680]  if you think Mexico is dangerous and scary we're gonna be way worse when we go belly
[28:43.680 --> 28:54.600]  up we are going into hell we turned our backs on God God turned his back on us repent that's
[28:54.600 --> 29:04.760]  what's important get your soul right and get prepared stay with us over the years in full
[29:04.760 --> 29:17.200]  time
[29:17.200 --> 29:23.320]  regular plain chain shirts that is all sorts of designer shirts that cost us
[29:23.320 --> 29:27.920]  $15, $20, $25 to produce. We used to sell for $40. We're selling them for $15,
[29:27.920 --> 29:31.440]  selling them for $20. Whatever the shirt costs us, if a shirt costs $5, we're
[29:31.440 --> 29:35.400]  selling it for $5 for us to actually produce. It costs $10, we're selling it for
[29:35.400 --> 29:39.600]  $10. And we've got hoodies, and we've got long sleeves, and we've got short sleeves.
[29:39.600 --> 29:42.720]  We've got them all, and we've got to liquidate them all. And they're limited
[29:42.720 --> 29:47.920]  edition because we're never going to make any of these designs. Again, we are going
[29:47.920 --> 29:51.520]  to come out with some new designs that will be limited, limited edition in the
[29:51.520 --> 29:55.360]  future. We've got to sell this to keep M4s on the air, plus it spreads the word.

[31:14.480 --> 31:18.480]  But we had to build our own infrastructure because of the censorship and
[31:18.480 --> 31:22.640]  de-platforming that cost tens of millions of dollars. And now, with Band-Aught
[31:22.640 --> 31:27.280]  video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform for thousands of

[31:38.000 --> 31:41.960]  and Band-Aught video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human
[31:41.960 --> 31:46.680]  liberty movement worldwide. But the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions
[31:46.680 --> 31:50.040]  of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.

[33:00.640 --> 33:09.160]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:09.160 --> 33:27.160]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[33:40.160 --> 33:46.320]  Well, as you know, I spent quite a bit of time here in the pre-war period. And when
[33:46.320 --> 33:50.160]  the invasion happened, I had friends who were in Donetsk, who were in the Ukrainian
[33:50.160 --> 33:53.800]  Army, who were writing to us and telling us, we're not going to survive tonight.
[33:53.800 --> 33:57.880]  We've been hit 500 times. You know, these are graduates of Defense Language
[33:57.880 --> 34:02.800]  Institute. These are my friends. And, you know, as the more I saw of the war going
[34:02.800 --> 34:07.400]  on, the more I thought, I'm done talking. All right. It's time to take action here.
[34:07.400 --> 34:13.600]  So about a month ago, I joined the International Legion here in Ukraine, and
[34:13.600 --> 34:20.400]  I am here to help this country fight, you know, what essentially is a war of its
[34:20.400 --> 34:26.880]  extermination. This is an existential war. And Russia has bought it to these people,
[34:26.920 --> 34:31.160]  and they are mass murdering civilians. And there are people here like me who are
[34:31.160 --> 34:32.360]  here to do something about it.
[34:32.360 --> 34:41.680]  That's MSNBC regular Malcolm and Nance telling everybody go over there and get
[34:41.680 --> 34:48.240]  involved in a war that Zelensky says will last 10 years. They're ready to fight.
[34:48.280 --> 34:54.200]  New Vietnam, Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, denies Russia would use nukes
[34:54.200 --> 34:58.040]  in Ukraine, despite the fact that Zelensky keeps saying it with no evidence of
[34:58.040 --> 35:02.400]  British government now admits that they're special air services. Soldiers are
[35:02.400 --> 35:06.280]  training troops on Ukrainian territory. And guess what? They've been doing it for
[35:06.280 --> 35:10.760]  at least eight years and helped overthrow the government before, which is why the
[35:10.760 --> 35:15.840]  Russians are so incredibly angry. New National Poll, Republicans see Biden as
[35:15.840 --> 35:22.080]  being more harmful than Putin. Yeah. Think so? And there's been so much
[35:22.840 --> 35:27.920]  incredible lying in the press. I never got to this clip yesterday, but I'm
[35:27.920 --> 35:32.640]  springing this on the crew. Will you guys queue up that German DW national TV
[35:32.640 --> 35:37.160]  piece? It's like a 10 minute report, but there's a short clip in it where they
[35:37.160 --> 35:41.720]  talk about medals being given to the people of Snake Island that didn't
[35:41.720 --> 35:46.880]  surrender to the battleship. They don't even tell you, hey, we lied to you and
[35:46.880 --> 35:51.840]  made that up as war propaganda and knew it wasn't true. Like the ghost of Kiev
[35:51.840 --> 35:57.920]  and all the rest of it. They just now, oh, hey, here now they here they are
[35:57.920 --> 36:02.800]  getting medals. Here's the guy that was on the radio telling the Russians
[36:02.800 --> 36:10.680]  screw off on the very battleship later sunk by two anti ship cruise missiles
[36:11.480 --> 36:16.920]  that hit the Moscow. So the Moscow didn't kill the civilians. The Moscow didn't
[36:16.920 --> 36:20.920]  attack the military there. The Moscow did no such thing on Snake Island, but it
[36:20.920 --> 36:25.360]  doesn't matter because people were already angry because they've been told a big
[36:25.360 --> 36:30.200]  lie. And that's how brainwashing works is they don't care if you even learn the
[36:30.200 --> 36:33.640]  truth later. If you emotionally start hating the Russians or whoever the
[36:33.640 --> 36:37.720]  target is. And so later when it comes out, it's a lie. You don't care. You're
[36:37.720 --> 36:42.040]  already going along with the disinformation. Here's a clip from
[36:42.040 --> 36:46.920]  DW TV with the magic folks from Snake Island all alive getting medals.
[36:46.920 --> 36:54.120]  The Moscow came to prominence at the start of the war. Being told to go F
[36:54.120 --> 36:58.920]  itself when it tried to capture Ukraine's Snake Island in the Black Sea.
[36:58.920 --> 37:28.880]  Last month, the man behind those words was awarded a medal for his
[37:28.880 --> 37:35.840]  bravery. Initially, Fiat killed. He and other soldiers were taken captive before
[37:35.840 --> 37:40.680]  being freed in a prisoner exchange. The Moscow was the main ship in Russia's
[37:40.680 --> 37:45.760]  Black Sea fleet. It's lost marks a significant reduction in Russia's
[37:45.760 --> 37:50.000]  firepower in the area and a huge symbolic blow for Moscow.
[37:53.000 --> 37:57.600]  So the United States is spending billions of dollars a month securing the
[37:57.600 --> 38:01.840]  border of Ukraine and fighting a war against the Russians. And now,
[38:01.840 --> 38:07.120]  Biden has announced the plan to send tanks, armored vehicles and attack
[38:07.120 --> 38:17.280]  helicopters into Ukraine. We're at war with Russia, folks. And did Russia turn
[38:17.280 --> 38:20.800]  off our pipelines? Did Russia open our borders? Did Russia teach pedophile
[38:20.800 --> 38:25.760]  storytime? No. Did Russia censor American conservatives? No. Look at this
[38:25.760 --> 38:31.600]  latest headline. Over 221,000 migrants, not illegal aliens, crossed southern
[38:31.600 --> 38:38.560]  border in March setting new record says the Border Patrol. But you know it's
[38:38.560 --> 38:43.280]  far more than that because they're catching maybe one in eight. Video,
[38:43.280 --> 38:47.680]  Texas Sheriff expects border is about to be overrun. It's already overrun,
[38:47.680 --> 38:54.000]  but he means just completely be gone. As the numbers are 10, 15 times even
[38:54.000 --> 39:00.080]  previous records. NBC suddenly had an epiphany Monday realizing that when
[39:00.080 --> 39:06.080]  Joe Biden lifts the 42 health authority on migrants crossing title 42 health
[39:06.080 --> 39:09.120]  authority on migrants crossing into the US, there will be a massive surge
[39:09.120 --> 39:12.880]  to the border. No medical checks, no criminal checks, no checks to see. Is
[39:12.880 --> 39:17.520]  that your child with you? A totally lawless border. But the airport wants
[39:17.520 --> 39:21.360]  to put its hands on your genitals and wants you to wear a mask and the IRS
[39:21.360 --> 39:24.160]  wants to know everything you do in your bank account with a warrant. But don't
[39:24.160 --> 39:26.880]  worry, the illegal aliens don't have to take vaccines and they don't have to
[39:26.880 --> 39:31.360]  wear a mask. They're always exempt. After all, they said the UN's bringing them
[39:31.360 --> 39:34.560]  into the US and the UN doesn't want liability from the experimental shots.
[39:34.560 --> 39:39.360]  That was in Reuters two months ago. Oh, we can't give it to the illegals
[39:39.360 --> 39:45.440]  because it might hurt them. This is only for the American people.
[39:45.440 --> 39:49.280]  White House down plays terrorists crossing over the wide open border. They're
[39:49.280 --> 39:54.560]  catching record numbers of them. Also, when Saki got demanded to apologize
[39:54.560 --> 39:58.240]  for her and Biden saying that the board patrol agents
[39:58.240 --> 40:02.240]  whipping their horses across the river, that's what you do. You spur the horses.
[40:02.240 --> 40:06.480]  You hit them with the reins because they don't really want to chase people and
[40:06.480 --> 40:09.600]  you know, run through rivers so they can break their legs. So you have to
[40:09.600 --> 40:16.880]  ha ha ha. And they went, oh, look, he's got a whip in his hand. It's Jango.
[40:16.880 --> 40:20.000]  And of course, it was Haitians trying to get into the KKK country,
[40:20.000 --> 40:24.880]  getting into the, no, no, ladies and gentlemen, well, it turns out
[40:24.880 --> 40:28.240]  none of it was true. It was all lie. They've been found not guilty
[40:28.240 --> 40:33.520]  by the investigation. Here is what the sheriff had to say about the collapsing
[40:33.520 --> 40:35.760]  border.
[40:36.640 --> 40:41.040]  Border officials revealing more migrants crossed into the US in March than
[40:41.040 --> 40:44.400]  any other month since records were kept. This has
[40:44.400 --> 40:47.120]  authorities braced for a massive surge after the
[40:47.120 --> 40:52.000]  Biden administration lifts a border restriction known as Title 42.
[40:52.000 --> 40:57.760]  Julia Ainslie has late details. Tonight, urgent warnings from the border
[40:57.760 --> 41:03.040]  with the border patrol, releasing these new images, saying a record 221,000
[41:03.040 --> 41:07.200]  migrants crossed into the US last month. Local officials expect
[41:07.200 --> 41:10.160]  that could soon double. Numbers like that would be completely
[41:10.160 --> 41:14.720]  overwhelming to our community. The surge is expected after the Biden
[41:14.720 --> 41:18.320]  administration decided to end a COVID border restriction
[41:18.320 --> 41:22.320]  called Title 42. The Department of Homeland Security estimates
[41:22.320 --> 41:26.400]  more than 170,000 migrants are waiting in Mexico,
[41:26.400 --> 41:30.640]  planning to cross when Title 42 is lifted May 23rd.
[41:30.640 --> 41:35.440]  What do you need from the Biden administration between now and May 23rd?
[41:35.440 --> 41:39.280]  Plans would be helpful. Commitment for additional funds.
[41:39.280 --> 41:42.560]  Migrants who cross through the Rio Grande Valley come through this bus station
[41:42.560 --> 41:45.440]  in downtown McAllen. And officials here worry that if the
[41:45.440 --> 41:48.800]  numbers get too high, it could overwhelm the bus station, the
[41:48.800 --> 41:52.960]  shelters, leaving people with nowhere to go and sleeping on the street.
[41:52.960 --> 41:56.720]  We're asking them to reconsider, you know, lifting the
[41:56.720 --> 42:00.960]  Title 42. Sheriff Eddie Guerra says he's been
[42:00.960 --> 42:04.320]  told by Border Patrol to have his officers on standby
[42:04.320 --> 42:08.080]  and case the ports of entry are overrun. We're talking about,
[42:08.080 --> 42:12.160]  you know, the deputies dressed in their right gear with
[42:12.160 --> 42:18.240]  their shields and their helmets and batons to keep the
[42:18.240 --> 42:22.880]  crowded bay. The Biden administration is facing bipartisan criticism of its
[42:22.880 --> 42:26.640]  immigration policy with 1.7 million illegal border
[42:26.640 --> 42:30.480]  crossings last year. An all-time record.
[42:30.480 --> 42:33.840]  Okay, so notice the globalists bring in their collapsed policy.
[42:33.840 --> 42:36.800]  Now they're getting ready to get rid of Biden, so they blame him. And he deserves
[42:36.800 --> 42:39.440]  blame, but he's like a captain under a general.
[42:39.440 --> 42:42.800]  They get the blame, the globalists, the deep state, the new world order, the
[42:42.800 --> 42:45.520]  replacement migration of the U.N., the Southern Property
[42:45.520 --> 42:49.520]  Law Center, the ADL, trying to silence anybody that exposes this. They're
[42:49.520 --> 42:52.800]  bringing in a permanent underclass they control.
[42:52.800 --> 42:57.840]  We'll be back with men getting women pregnant in prison. Stay with us.
[42:59.840 --> 43:04.240]  Over the years, M4 Wars has produced more than 200
[43:04.240 --> 43:09.040]  amazing Patriot Americana Second Amendment pro-liberty themed

[43:46.560 --> 43:49.920]  we are going to come out with some new designs that will be limited,
[43:49.920 --> 43:53.520]  limited edition in the future. We've got to sell this to keep M4s on the

[45:03.040 --> 45:06.480]  Hello, Alex. Yes, Malcolm. All right, I will make this quick and real
[45:06.480 --> 45:08.800]  short where the other patrons can get on the line.
[45:08.800 --> 45:13.200]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer.
[45:13.200 --> 45:17.520]  Supermal vitality and brain force plus. Mix those two together.
[45:17.520 --> 45:20.960]  You're an unstoppable tank. Supermal vitality really, really works.
[45:20.960 --> 45:25.840]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[45:25.840 --> 45:30.320]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions.
[45:30.320 --> 45:32.560]  It also worked quite well. They just aren't as strong.
[45:32.560 --> 45:36.560]  This is like a very fine wine. In fact, each batch is different.
[45:36.560 --> 45:38.960]  Sometimes it's super strong. Sometimes it's just okay.
[45:38.960 --> 45:42.320]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[45:42.320 --> 45:44.000]  That's just how it is. It's how it works.
[45:44.880 --> 45:48.640]  So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[45:48.640 --> 45:58.800]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[45:58.800 --> 46:01.600]  You know, it's a fact and I'm not bragging when I say it.
[46:01.600 --> 46:07.840]  It's just true that info wars is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty
[46:07.840 --> 46:15.440]  as the logo of human populist resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program.
[46:15.440 --> 46:23.280]  And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done.

[47:16.320 --> 47:20.800]  There's a war on logic. There's a war on common sense.
[47:20.800 --> 47:26.800]  There's a war on goodness because an evil group of inbred families using behavioral psychology
[47:27.440 --> 47:33.440]  have a plan for humanity that's destructive, that's ugly, that's sad, that's humiliating,
[47:33.440 --> 47:36.880]  that's deadly. So they need us to go against common sense.
[47:37.520 --> 47:43.280]  They used to go against our own instincts and our own connection to God to follow the destructive
[47:43.280 --> 47:48.960]  path that they have prepared for us. They are the biggest control freaks this world has ever
[47:48.960 --> 47:56.000]  produced and we are facing down this tyranny today just as our ancestors faced other combinations
[47:56.000 --> 48:02.720]  and other permutations and this will be our finest hour if we simply take on the challenge and realize
[48:03.440 --> 48:09.760]  we don't have any alternative. Slavery and humiliation and turning our children over to pure
[48:09.760 --> 48:15.360]  evil is not an option. The only option we have is getting informed, getting focused,
[48:15.360 --> 48:20.400]  and standing up. Now for those of us who are the most prominent in this fight and for those of us
[48:20.400 --> 48:25.600]  who are the most bold, the enemy is going to pull out all the stops and engage in a lot of manipulation
[48:25.600 --> 48:31.520]  and corruption and try to demonize us and silence us. And as the lies and demonization
[48:31.520 --> 48:37.040]  and deplatforming and fraud backfire on the system, they're going to get more desperate
[48:37.040 --> 48:42.000]  and doubled down in their attempts to finally bully us into silence.
[48:42.000 --> 48:50.000]  They're coming after me because they're coming after you. That's totally true.
[48:50.000 --> 48:57.040]  And Info Wars is a populist lighthouse in a deadly storm guiding in the ships. We so many times,
[48:57.600 --> 49:04.080]  hell probably half the time, are the progenitor or the fount or the spring head
[49:04.080 --> 49:11.520]  of the awakening and the understanding of the globalist philosophy and how to beat them.
[49:12.480 --> 49:15.920]  And for those of us that have been informed and awake a long time, a lot of people before I was
[49:15.920 --> 49:22.480]  born knew about this, but then it was less than one to the 1% that knew. My grandfather knew.
[49:23.280 --> 49:27.920]  My mother's father knew everything. That would have been the real Alex Jones. That guy was smart
[49:27.920 --> 49:32.960]  as hell, a scientist. They did secret stuff for the Pentagon, you name it, but I'll leave it at that.
[49:32.960 --> 49:36.240]  The point is that
[49:40.560 --> 49:45.360]  now a large portion of people know the truth, 20% or so, and it's growing.
[49:47.440 --> 49:51.760]  And whether you're in Africa or the subcontinent of India or whether you're in Eastern Europe,
[49:51.760 --> 50:01.280]  Info Wars is as hot as a white flame. It is burning bright. And that's all because of your
[50:01.280 --> 50:06.000]  support. So before I hit these other key stories here, I just want to encourage listeners to
[50:06.000 --> 50:10.400]  support Info Wars while you still can. And I want to thank the folks that stepped up to the plate
[50:10.400 --> 50:17.280]  yesterday and bought a lot of products and made donations at infowarstore.com. If we had days
[50:17.280 --> 50:25.440]  like that every day, we wouldn't just survive, we would expand. But I need to have 20 days like
[50:25.440 --> 50:30.960]  yesterday to dig out of the hole and be able to fight for years to come, despite all the things
[50:30.960 --> 50:37.280]  the left wants to not shutter and shut down this command base, this mothership. Now, I got a lot
[50:37.280 --> 50:41.680]  of powerful friends and a lot of good people are awake now and it takes time to get them going.
[50:42.240 --> 50:48.800]  But they will not silence me being on air, but they could cripple some of the effectiveness
[50:49.520 --> 50:55.280]  and really, really, really delay us and things we're up to. And I'm not going to give the enemy
[50:55.280 --> 51:00.960]  our strategy or what we're doing, but there's a lot going on in Austin. There's a lot going on in
[51:00.960 --> 51:07.760]  Florida. There's a lot going on and I'm advising a lot of top people to the grace of God. Now,
[51:07.760 --> 51:14.400]  my work isn't just here on air, but it's particularly when it comes to advising some very,
[51:14.400 --> 51:21.840]  very interesting people about the next phase of resistance, peaceful resistance. So my work is
[51:21.840 --> 51:27.680]  extremely important, ladies and gentlemen. And this particular operation, though, is just the tip
[51:27.680 --> 51:36.640]  of the iceberg and is very critical, though. And so don't just share the articles and videos,
[51:36.640 --> 51:42.320]  which is so paramount. Don't just pray for us. Go to m4warstore.com and get some of the ultimate

[52:19.200 --> 52:23.360]  except for the new, because by the time I decided to sell out of all the t-shirts in the backlog,
[52:24.000 --> 52:28.640]  we already had six, seven more shirts in the pipeline. So the Alex Jones was right shirt came
[52:28.640 --> 52:32.480]  in. This is just the regular one, but it's like designer fabric and super high quality.
[52:33.520 --> 52:38.400]  So it costs us seven, eight bucks a shirt. So we're selling it for $24.95 as a fundraiser. Get
[52:38.400 --> 52:42.320]  your Alex Jones was right shirt with a big red Thunderbolt on the back infowars.com.
[52:43.600 --> 52:51.200]  It's a piece of Americana, a piece of history infowarstore.com. And please get a book, get a film,
[52:51.200 --> 52:54.880]  get some water filtration, get some air filtration, check out the shortwave radios,

[53:05.120 --> 53:09.600]  could not buy products at a better place. And I'll also tell you, you know, the live show feed of
[53:09.600 --> 53:16.160]  the show today that deals with Tuesday live IMF slashes global economic outlook confirms
[53:16.160 --> 53:19.600]  depression mass starvation. That's coming up next hour, the special guests and more.
[53:20.800 --> 53:25.600]  There's a link we put under the live show video feed directly to the sub page on
[53:26.560 --> 53:33.520]  infowarstore.com where you can make a donation. Please donate today to keep info wars on air
[53:33.520 --> 53:40.000]  so we can defend the First Amendment and take on the globalist. And again, that's great because
[53:40.000 --> 53:44.480]  you know, we're evil patriot groups. I used to get like 2% on credit cards, we pay like 5% on them
[53:44.480 --> 53:48.240]  because we're discriminated against because we're Christian conservatives. But we get 95% of the
[53:48.240 --> 53:53.280]  money when you donate instead of, you know, 30, 40% of the money when you buy a product. So please
[53:53.280 --> 54:00.080]  make a donation today at infowars.com by going to the live show feed, click the link or there's
[54:00.080 --> 54:04.880]  a big banner on the front page of infowarstore.com. And again, I want to thank those that came through
[54:04.880 --> 54:09.360]  yesterday. It gives me a lot of hope because you're in my corner, God's in my corner, this
[54:09.360 --> 54:15.680]  crew's in my corner, I'm in your corner, but I cannot do this without you. And the last thing I
[54:15.680 --> 54:22.560]  want to do is you shut this place down because we're cut back to the bare minimum of crew we need.
[54:22.560 --> 54:26.240]  We've got a great crew. I've asked them keep making great ads, keep making great reports,
[54:26.240 --> 54:30.800]  keep writing great stories, just fight harder than you ever had before because this is like a
[54:30.800 --> 54:34.880]  heavyweight championship battle and the enemy's in trouble, they're falling apart, people are
[54:34.880 --> 54:40.000]  seeing through them, they're pulling out all the stops doing unprecedented things to silence us
[54:40.000 --> 54:44.240]  and to silence you, but that's because they're weak and because the world is rejecting them
[54:44.240 --> 54:48.560]  and that is a beautiful thing. So just make commitment. You can do a one-time donation
[54:48.560 --> 54:53.840]  at infoworkstore.com or you could sign up and give one every 10 days, 20 days, 30 days, month,
[54:53.840 --> 54:57.680]  out to nine months. You can do auto stuff. You can do auto ship on the products
[54:57.680 --> 55:02.960]  and additional 10% off. You can go there and click on it and then say every month I want to give
[55:02.960 --> 55:10.800]  $10 or $50. You just cannot put money in a better place to fight tyranny. This is it. And if you
[55:10.800 --> 55:15.760]  want to take on the globalist, this is where you should put your money and your will and your prayers
[55:15.760 --> 55:21.440]  and your word of mouth. So thank you. I'm doing everything I can. The ball is in your court as
[55:21.440 --> 55:27.040]  they say, okay, let's move on to this. Again, the brainwashing, the in-your-face gaslighting
[55:27.760 --> 55:33.600]  all over the country. There's more than 12 states, last time I was like 13 states, 14 states,
[55:33.600 --> 55:40.640]  that have biological men in the prison cells with the women, raping them and having consensual sex.
[55:40.640 --> 55:45.840]  And then they've got the nerve in the corporate media to gaslight us and say, oh, two women had a
[55:45.840 --> 55:53.360]  baby. It was consensual. Well, trans inmate impregnates two inmates at all women's prison.
[55:54.720 --> 56:02.720]  And it's a black dude with a ponytail. And then here's the news. New Jersey news. Two women at
[56:02.720 --> 56:08.080]  New Jersey prison are pregnant after consensual sex between inmates. I mean, two women, they just
[56:08.080 --> 56:13.360]  sit here and brainwash us to accept all this tyranny. New Jersey's women prison inmates pregnant
[56:13.360 --> 56:19.120]  after sex with transgender prisoner. Trans prisoners impregnate two women inmates at all female jail.
[56:20.880 --> 56:26.720]  And then Dr. Carlson does an interview with a woman who thought she was a man, wasn't happy,
[56:26.720 --> 56:32.160]  went back to being her biological sex, and YouTube bans it because, well, you're not allowed to go
[56:32.160 --> 56:41.920]  back once you're in the cult. Absolutely insane next level censorship that is going on. It's
[56:41.920 --> 56:47.360]  happening in New Jersey. It's happening in California. It's happening again in 13 states last
[56:47.360 --> 56:53.520]  number. Last number I saw. And what's the whole scientific establishment response? Democrats
[56:53.520 --> 57:00.560]  are working with big tech on new censorship calls and new levels of censorship and debanking people
[57:00.560 --> 57:07.520]  with a social credit score they don't like. I mean, wow. Meanwhile, Brian Stelter, Humpy Dump,
[57:07.520 --> 57:12.000]  came out and said, people don't play in the gutter calls for more censorship on Twitter, to which
[57:12.000 --> 57:16.640]  Jack Dorsey comes out and says, you are destructive and hurtful and you are a liar. Talk about the
[57:16.640 --> 57:21.200]  worm turning. People really get it. Elon Musk threatens that once he takes over Twitter is
[57:21.200 --> 57:25.440]  going to fire the board. It's got people on it that are members of the Bilderberg group.
[57:26.080 --> 57:33.280]  Absolutely insane. Infowars.com. Tomorrow's news today. All right. There was a special guest
[57:33.280 --> 57:38.400]  coming up. We'll also have news on the exploding crime waves and the move to ban all gas cars by

[58:02.240 --> 58:07.280]  that's it. We'll have limited editions one at a time in the future. And when they're gone, they're
[58:07.280 --> 58:12.880]  gone. Well, here's the new limited edition shirt. This one is $24.95. Really nice fabric. Alex Jones

[1:00:17.040 --> 1:00:38.480]  Well, Dr. Lee Merritt's really a smart lady and medical doctor and I want to get her take on.
[1:00:38.480 --> 1:00:45.120]  She's happening with the COVID tyranny and more when she joins us coming up after this break here
[1:00:45.120 --> 1:00:49.760]  and there's a special reporter about there and then after she leaves us, I'm going to open the
[1:00:49.760 --> 1:00:57.280]  phones up like I did yesterday and I'm going to hit the economic news and more of the military news
[1:00:57.280 --> 1:01:03.120]  and then all of this Democrat news that we've got with Biden announcing he will run for president
[1:01:03.120 --> 1:01:10.000]  again. Wow, can you imagine him even making the midterms must less that? He's being led around
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:17.280]  by the Easter Bunny. That is all coming up, ladies and gentlemen, here today and you're
[1:01:17.280 --> 1:01:22.480]  awake. You're informed. You kind of take being informed like I do sometimes for granted. The
[1:01:22.480 --> 1:01:26.960]  general public doesn't know what's going on and they're desperate for the truth and they're ready
[1:01:26.960 --> 1:01:32.560]  to be awakened right now. That's why this broadcast is so important because they're trying to bring
[1:01:32.560 --> 1:01:45.360]  the lockdowns back. That's admitted. We got to stop them. Social media from the CCP rarely ever
[1:01:45.360 --> 1:01:53.120]  makes its way into American pop culture. But in early 2020, they went viral with radical videos
[1:01:53.120 --> 1:01:58.400]  of forced quarantines and sealing people into their own dwellings with welding torches.
[1:01:58.400 --> 1:02:05.360]  We're Americans shown all this to make our own lockdowns seem less devastating. And if so, what
[1:02:05.360 --> 1:02:11.600]  are we to make of the new social media blitz coming out of Shanghai? People are being starved in
[1:02:11.600 --> 1:02:20.080]  their own homes. Their pets are being killed. And it's getting so hellish that suicide is seemingly
[1:02:20.080 --> 1:02:29.120]  an everyday part of life now in Shanghai. Just because things are feeling a bit more liberating
[1:02:29.120 --> 1:02:35.440]  in America doesn't mean the lockdowns are over. How in the hell are these Democrats going to win
[1:02:35.440 --> 1:02:41.600]  an election without another lockdown? They're already setting up the narrative and have invested
[1:02:41.600 --> 1:02:48.560]  in new mobile testing machines. If you think Trump is somehow going to save you, even though he
[1:02:48.560 --> 1:02:54.560]  helped in the last lockdown and proudly gave birth to the deadly vaccines, he just sided
[1:02:54.560 --> 1:03:03.920]  with Dr. Oz. The way I endorsed another person today, Dr. Oz in Pennsylvania. Dr. Oz. Great guy,
[1:03:03.920 --> 1:03:11.600]  good man, good man, Harvard educated. And Dr. Oz loves the CCP lockdown model. And the Chinese
[1:03:11.600 --> 1:03:16.880]  numbers have dropped dramatically, which is fantastic news. And it's also valuable for us
[1:03:16.880 --> 1:03:20.640]  to understand why they were able to do that. If you look inside of Wuhan province, they had a
[1:03:20.640 --> 1:03:25.520]  catastrophe. But outside the province, which of course they quarantined in the largest movement
[1:03:25.520 --> 1:03:30.080]  of its nature ever, 60 million people blocked in that space. But the rest of the country was
[1:03:30.080 --> 1:03:35.360]  relatively spare. They didn't have the big spikes, the huge crises that Wuhan experienced. And it
[1:03:35.360 --> 1:03:39.520]  took the country to a very different direction. We just have to copy what they did, take their
[1:03:39.520 --> 1:03:44.480]  blueprint and repeat it here in this country. And we started that aggressively over the last week.
[1:03:44.480 --> 1:03:51.760]  In trauma based mind control, the abuser alternates between abuse and comfort, which forms a bond
[1:03:51.760 --> 1:03:58.800]  with the victim known in pop culture as Stockholm syndrome. This might not work on you. But they
[1:03:58.800 --> 1:04:04.560]  are not doing it for you. They want the majority on their side when they start arresting people like
[1:04:04.560 --> 1:04:11.440]  you for forced vaccination. And of course, gun confiscation. Well, China has has a number of
[1:04:11.440 --> 1:04:19.680]  problems, two of which are that their complete lockdown, which was their approach, a strictest
[1:04:19.680 --> 1:04:25.920]  lockdown that you'd never be able to implement in the United States. Although that prevents the
[1:04:25.920 --> 1:04:31.680]  spread of infection. And remember early on, they were saying, and I think accurately that they
[1:04:31.680 --> 1:04:37.760]  were doing better than almost anybody else. But lockdown has its consequences. You use lockdowns
[1:04:37.760 --> 1:04:43.760]  to get people vaccinated. Reporting for Info Wars, this is Greg Rees.
[1:04:59.360 --> 1:05:03.680]  It's about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand Info Wars. I've been on the air a couple of years,
[1:05:03.680 --> 1:05:09.040]  but I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show. I wanted to hire camera
[1:05:09.040 --> 1:05:13.600]  people. I wanted to make films. I wanted to really challenge the globalist. And it was a t-shirt I
[1:05:13.600 --> 1:05:19.760]  designed. The first one mass murderers agreed gun control works that helped us finance hiring the
[1:05:19.760 --> 1:05:24.960]  first members of my crew. That's our oldest design and we still sell it. We have that design over a
[1:05:24.960 --> 1:05:29.680]  hundred others that will now all be limited editions because whatever stock we've got in,
[1:05:29.680 --> 1:05:35.040]  that's it. We're selling everything out to find the operation to get rid of inventory.
[1:05:35.040 --> 1:05:38.800]  We'll still have some t-shirts in the future. They'll just be limited editions and short runs.
[1:05:38.800 --> 1:05:43.680]  So if you want to get any of these historic shirts, this is your last chance. I almost forgot.
[1:05:43.680 --> 1:05:50.480]  We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com. Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie,
[1:05:50.480 --> 1:05:55.760]  every long sleeve, every t-shirt, regular shirts, designer shirts, they're all selling at cost
[1:05:55.760 --> 1:06:11.680]  infowarstore.com. From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:25.760 --> 1:06:31.840]  Well, she has been hardcore the last two plus years, day one exposing the corrupt power grab
[1:06:32.560 --> 1:06:39.840]  that was the whole COVID-19 police state paradigm. She's a medical doctor, Dr. Lee Merritt.
[1:06:40.880 --> 1:06:45.440]  And I wanted to get her on to talk about the state of the world, the 400 million dollar lockdown in
[1:06:45.440 --> 1:06:49.840]  China, these different health officials in Europe and the US and Canada saying lockdowns are coming
[1:06:49.840 --> 1:06:57.200]  back right after the election and the airports putting in mask enforcement robots and permanent
[1:06:57.200 --> 1:07:03.600]  COVID facilities but now saying, oh, you can take the mask off yesterday with this federal ruling.
[1:07:03.600 --> 1:07:08.880]  I want to get her take on what she thinks they're going to pull next and how they're coming after
[1:07:08.880 --> 1:07:13.680]  doctors and free speech, the Federation of State Medical Boards telling state boards to go after
[1:07:13.680 --> 1:07:18.400]  doctors for disinformation, which means questioning all the known lies that we were told that have
[1:07:18.400 --> 1:07:23.840]  been proven to be lies. Number two, we'll talk about biolabs going back to 1991, but you can't
[1:07:23.840 --> 1:07:28.400]  shut down the labs. You have to defund the snake. Why are these insiders not speaking about things
[1:07:28.400 --> 1:07:34.000]  that really matter? What's going on? And the whole snake venom angle that's out there,
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:39.040]  she wants to get into that. But first off, Dr. Lee Merritt, thank you so much for joining us,
[1:07:39.040 --> 1:07:46.720]  themedicalrebel.com, demonized and attacked by the corporate media for telling the truth
[1:07:46.720 --> 1:07:50.400]  that the mask didn't work, the vaccine wouldn't work, that it wasn't a vaccine.
[1:07:50.400 --> 1:07:54.160]  You've certainly been vindicated, you and many other prominent people, but what do you make of
[1:07:54.160 --> 1:08:00.080]  where we are now? I see it as a global awakening, people pushing back, they panic with Joe Rogan
[1:08:00.080 --> 1:08:04.640]  and others getting on board, Tucker Carlson, and so they kind of backed off till our political
[1:08:04.640 --> 1:08:09.360]  resistance dissipates and then they'll be right back at their attack. Again, that is how they've
[1:08:09.360 --> 1:08:15.280]  operated in the past. What do you think's happening right now? Well, I hope that's right. I hope that
[1:08:15.280 --> 1:08:20.640]  it was our, I hope it was the trucker standing up and us doing stuff. I really think that's my
[1:08:20.640 --> 1:08:26.240]  hope. But I have to say, you know, Albert Biederman, the psychologist that has Biederman's
[1:08:26.240 --> 1:08:32.640]  chart of coercion, how you coerce prisoners, and he developed that, he wrote the book on brainwashing
[1:08:32.640 --> 1:08:37.920]  after the Korean War, after being asked by the government to look at what happened to our prisoners
[1:08:37.920 --> 1:08:42.800]  of war. And essentially, you know, there's a sequence of events. I mean, first you isolate
[1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:48.000]  people, then you monopolize their perception, think, you know, being locked in your house and
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:52.720]  watching CNN all day, all day, you know, people that might have watched it 30 minutes, and then
[1:08:52.720 --> 1:08:58.000]  they became scared, and then they, you know, and then you do other things. You have nonsensical
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:03.920]  requirements, you know, stand six feet apart and a little government approved circle and wear a mask
[1:09:03.920 --> 1:09:09.360]  that nobody agrees, that nobody believes works, things like that. But then there's a point where
[1:09:09.360 --> 1:09:14.160]  one of the things in his chart of coercion is after you've really locked them down and you've
[1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:19.360]  taken away all their liberties, you give them a bit of freedom, and they start to have hope and
[1:09:19.360 --> 1:09:25.440]  they start to feel better about things, and then you lock it down again. And that just demoralizes
[1:09:25.440 --> 1:09:30.640]  them terribly and makes them really bend to your will. And I just hope that that's not what's going
[1:09:30.640 --> 1:09:35.840]  on, but I fear it. Yeah. Well, they admit that's exactly what's going on. The images out of China,
[1:09:35.840 --> 1:09:43.280]  the globalists follow China's model, and they have been under months of lockdown, 400 million
[1:09:43.280 --> 1:09:50.640]  people. This is a real exercise in evil. Right. And I'm not even sure what the justification,
[1:09:50.640 --> 1:09:57.760]  I mean, they're saying COVID, you know, it's just hard to fathom. I do think it's pretty funny when
[1:09:57.760 --> 1:10:01.600]  you look at the COVID numbers, and we haven't, I haven't been on for a while to talk about this,
[1:10:01.600 --> 1:10:06.800]  but don't you think it's funny that the scientists are just all baffled? That was actually on a
[1:10:06.800 --> 1:10:12.560]  headline. Scientists and researchers baffled that Africa has such a low rate of COVID when they
[1:10:12.560 --> 1:10:19.760]  only have 5% vaccination in most countries. Africa had several thousand percentage points
[1:10:19.760 --> 1:10:24.480]  lower than the US, tens of thousands lower than Israel, because none of them trusted
[1:10:24.480 --> 1:10:29.680]  the government, none of them took the vaccine. Yeah. And now the scientists are baffled.
[1:10:29.680 --> 1:10:34.400]  I mean, you know, at some point, it should be obvious to them where the vaccine goes,
[1:10:34.400 --> 1:10:38.560]  death and destruction follow. And we asked, why are the Africans so smart? Well, they've been under
[1:10:38.560 --> 1:10:42.240]  IMF World Bank control where the countries don't get the money unless they take the shots.
[1:10:42.240 --> 1:10:46.800]  They've seen the effect of these global shot programs, and they run from the vehicles. They
[1:10:46.800 --> 1:10:52.960]  run from the UN. That's right. And they've been experimented on. I mean, you know, when we talk
[1:10:52.960 --> 1:10:58.320]  about things, you go back, this is all these emerging infectious diseases. And, you know, after
[1:10:58.320 --> 1:11:04.720]  we, after we got rid of our bio weapons labs, theoretically, after the tree was signed in
[1:11:04.720 --> 1:11:11.120]  73. Yeah. Now they're called bio weapon research piece labs, how to counter the bio weapon. They
[1:11:11.120 --> 1:11:17.040]  make the bio weapon. Yeah, they have lots of, they have lots of acronyms for DTRA, the Defense
[1:11:17.040 --> 1:11:22.240]  Threat Reduction Agency, Cooperative Threat Reduction, you got on and on. It's always threat
[1:11:22.240 --> 1:11:26.400]  reduction. If you see something named threat reduction, don't stand too close. It's probably
[1:11:26.400 --> 1:11:31.920]  a bio weapons lab or, you know, some other similar facilities. So, yeah. But, you know, in Africa,
[1:11:31.920 --> 1:11:39.040]  in South Africa, the South African Defense Force was running bio weapons research in the 80s and 90s.
[1:11:40.480 --> 1:11:43.200]  They were selling race specific stuff to the Israelis.
[1:11:44.160 --> 1:11:48.400]  Right. And we, and we were, we were involved in that, not officially, because officially we
[1:11:48.400 --> 1:11:53.600]  couldn't be involved in, we signed the treaty. But, but, you know, do you think we just sat around
[1:11:53.600 --> 1:11:59.600]  and did nothing? It's interesting. We also converted a lot of like, like Fort Dietrich became a
[1:11:59.600 --> 1:12:05.440]  cancer research facility. They, they hide bio weapons research. People need to keep this in
[1:12:05.440 --> 1:12:10.320]  mind under cancer research and under veterinary research. The veterinary research right now
[1:12:10.320 --> 1:12:18.080]  is a big deal because of this avian flu that they're claiming is going to, I mean, this is nowhere
[1:12:18.080 --> 1:12:24.400]  in the starvation phase of this, you know, of this war. I said, we're in a, we're in a four-part war.
[1:12:24.400 --> 1:12:30.560]  The first part was releasing a man-made bio weapon that was probably a contact pathogen,
[1:12:30.560 --> 1:12:34.800]  but we can debate that. But something came out that made people sick that we call the spike
[1:12:34.800 --> 1:12:39.360]  protein, spike protein syndrome. And, but that didn't really do much. I mean, it killed some
[1:12:39.360 --> 1:12:44.000]  people spectacularly and then it kind of calmed down. And then we go, yeah, right now bird flu
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:49.040]  in Iowa. So we'll get to that. So the next phase of the war, phase two was the, the fake tests
[1:12:49.040 --> 1:12:53.200]  and the psychological. And by the way, I saw you months ago saying on another show,
[1:12:53.200 --> 1:12:56.080]  I've been trying to get you on that you said bird flu is next. How did you know that?
[1:12:56.960 --> 1:13:01.200]  Well, that's what I'm talking about. So, so phase three was a vaccine. And then phase four is
[1:13:01.200 --> 1:13:07.040]  they're sitting back and waiting to see what the death counts are. And I got a text from a friend
[1:13:07.040 --> 1:13:14.560]  of mine six months, eight months ago, who said, watch Robert Cadlich. He's coming to Kansas.
[1:13:14.560 --> 1:13:20.960]  He's going to damage your, your food supply. Now, you know, again, veterinary medicine has
[1:13:20.960 --> 1:13:26.000]  been a big deal for hiding bio weapons. Well, sure. That's like Plum Island was zoological stuff.
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:31.120]  Exactly. They always had them in zoological. Yeah. I mean, it goes back to the Japanese in
[1:13:31.120 --> 1:13:35.840]  Manchurian World War two. That was all couched under veterinary research. But in Wisconsin,
[1:13:35.840 --> 1:13:41.600]  and it's a Japanese name that I'm blanking on now, but he was, he was given a lot of money to
[1:13:42.160 --> 1:13:48.960]  research the pandemic of 1918 virus, which it's really a joke how they're even they're thinking,
[1:13:48.960 --> 1:13:54.160]  they're logical thinking about this week. That that's a deep hole. But it, but in any case,
[1:13:54.160 --> 1:14:00.800]  let's say he did get the virus, then they claim we that that was, that was gain of function
[1:14:00.800 --> 1:14:08.000]  research was used to mix that somehow with avian virus to come up with a, an avian flu
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:12.560]  that could be more deadly to humans. And even the bio weapons people at some point, or these
[1:14:12.560 --> 1:14:17.360]  viral researchers got a conscience and started speaking out against this. So I think that's
[1:14:17.360 --> 1:14:22.240]  what's going on. But to be honest, I don't think there's avian flu breaking out. I don't think
[1:14:22.240 --> 1:14:29.120]  that's what it is. They're testing using the same PCR tests that are that are that we decided
[1:14:29.120 --> 1:14:34.240]  were we took off the market. Sure. The PCR test says a chicken or a turkey has it. They just kill
[1:14:34.240 --> 1:14:39.360]  the whole flock. Right. And they kill the flock. And then they come after every, every flock in
[1:14:39.360 --> 1:14:45.360]  the area. So, you know, the other, and it's also not an isolation. Let's just think about
[1:14:45.360 --> 1:14:51.680]  in addition to taking out the chicken, chicken flocks, they are now saying UP railroad won't
[1:14:51.680 --> 1:14:57.040]  haul fertilizer in time for the spring planting season. You know, what's the rule for that?
[1:14:57.040 --> 1:15:02.720]  Are we worried about fertilizer disease now? I mean, this is a starvation. I tell people,
[1:15:02.720 --> 1:15:07.040]  do not wait to start a garden. Do not wait to become. Oh, you're right. There's no doubt.
[1:15:07.040 --> 1:15:14.000]  Every button, every lever they can push or pull to shut down energy and fertilizer and food that
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:19.440]  it is being turned off right now. Right. But the chickens are the things right now. And I tell people
[1:15:20.240 --> 1:15:24.000]  there, there is, you know, that's why you have a sheriff. Don't let them come into your county
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:29.920]  and do this. Don't let them take out these birds on the theory. Have them prove to you that there's
[1:15:29.920 --> 1:15:33.840]  an actual disease that we're going to do. No, you're right. It's all a giant power grab. A precedent
[1:15:33.840 --> 1:15:41.440]  to kill and destroy and shut down whatever they want. Right. Right. Yeah. Industry warns. You
[1:15:41.440 --> 1:15:46.800]  know, show me some proof. It's, it's just like Patrick King up in Alberta. Show me the virus
[1:15:46.800 --> 1:15:50.720]  exists before you find me. All right. Not really, Merritt. Stay right there. But it's clear.
[1:15:50.720 --> 1:15:55.600]  The bureaucracies, governments, corporations are testing total control. This is all a beta test.
[1:15:58.240 --> 1:16:02.400]  It was about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand in for worse. I've been on the air a couple of
[1:16:02.400 --> 1:16:07.440]  years, but I only had money to finance my own simple little local radio show. And I wanted to
[1:16:07.440 --> 1:16:11.440]  hire camera people. I wanted to make films. I wanted to really challenge the globalist.
[1:16:11.440 --> 1:16:16.160]  And it was a t-shirt I designed. The first one mass murderers agreed gun control works
[1:16:16.160 --> 1:16:21.200]  that helped us finance hiring the first two members of my crew. That's our oldest design
[1:16:21.200 --> 1:16:26.240]  and we're still selling. We have that design over a hundred others that will now all be limited
[1:16:26.240 --> 1:16:31.760]  editions because whatever stock we've got in, that's it. We're selling everything out to find
[1:16:31.760 --> 1:16:35.760]  the operation to get rid of inventory. We'll still have some teachers in the future. They'll
[1:16:35.760 --> 1:16:40.160]  just be limited editions and short runs. So if you want to get any of these historic shirts,
[1:16:40.160 --> 1:16:46.400]  this is your last chance. I almost forgot. We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.
[1:16:46.400 --> 1:16:52.640]  Every ball cap, every flag, every hoodie, every long sleeve, every t-shirt, regular shirts, designer
[1:16:52.640 --> 1:17:01.280]  shirts, they're all selling at cost infowarstore.com. Ladies and gentlemen, infowarstore.com is
[1:17:01.280 --> 1:17:09.120]  offering the biggest sales in its over 20 year history. And that is because the economy is
[1:17:09.120 --> 1:17:15.040]  breaking down, inflation is exploding, the supply chains have broken down, and info wars is having
[1:17:15.040 --> 1:17:20.400]  serious trouble making its payroll and paying for operations. And I do not want to implode or
[1:17:20.400 --> 1:17:25.520]  downsize in the face of the globalists making their main move. Info wars, it's paradoxical,
[1:17:25.520 --> 1:17:30.480]  is more popular than ever. It's reaching more people than ever despite the censorship. But
[1:17:30.480 --> 1:17:34.240]  because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure, pay for our own bandwidth,
[1:17:34.240 --> 1:17:41.520]  everything else, we are running out of money. So listen, up to 75% off infowarstore.com on
[1:17:41.520 --> 1:17:47.520]  things like amazing patriot t-shirts that help spread the word and fund the operation. On supplements,
[1:17:47.520 --> 1:17:53.840]  on books, on films, everything is 25 to 75% off right now. The biggest sell in our history
[1:17:53.840 --> 1:18:00.240]  at infowarstore.com. Thank you for your support. Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help. I need
[1:18:00.240 --> 1:18:05.680]  your help keeping info wars on the air and strong. I need your help making sure that our mission
[1:18:05.680 --> 1:18:11.840]  continues on. I was born for this. You were born for this. And people are really waking up right
[1:18:11.840 --> 1:18:16.960]  now. But we had to build our own infrastructure because of the censorship and de-platforming
[1:18:16.960 --> 1:18:22.000]  that cost tens of millions of dollars. And now, with Bandot video getting close to 10 million views
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:28.160]  a day, we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their
[1:18:28.160 --> 1:18:36.400]  content free of charge. And because it's become so successful, it's a catch 22. Info wars and Bandot
[1:18:36.400 --> 1:18:42.320]  video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide. But the expenses
[1:18:42.320 --> 1:18:46.960]  in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of
[1:18:46.960 --> 1:18:51.680]  dollars a month. So the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now, the mega emergency
[1:18:51.680 --> 1:18:57.520]  blowout sale of the 75% off getting credible products and keep info wars as strong as ever.

[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:55.520]  you don't take action. Take action now info wars store.com.
[1:19:55.520 --> 1:20:12.320]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[1:20:12.560 --> 1:20:17.520]  There are powerful corporations in the world that want control of human development. They want to
[1:20:17.520 --> 1:20:21.920]  make humanity a commodity, not not just free men and women getting together and having families
[1:20:21.920 --> 1:20:29.120]  living our lives. They want to not just make the crops GMO, they want to make us GMO. It's a
[1:20:29.120 --> 1:20:34.480]  corporate takeover of the individual of the human system. And Dr. Lee Merritt, medical doctor,
[1:20:35.600 --> 1:20:41.600]  is here with us laying all this out. Also a Navy physician giving her kind of that inside view
[1:20:41.600 --> 1:20:48.000]  that before she was in private practice. So continuing, what do you expect to come next?
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:54.560]  And what can we do to not let them reinstate these lockdowns? We know they're preparing.
[1:20:57.040 --> 1:21:01.920]  Well, I mean, I mentioned that what they're coming after next is they're coming after
[1:21:01.920 --> 1:21:07.120]  the doctors. And just like they came after, I mean, if we're going to be in a in a forced
[1:21:07.120 --> 1:21:11.360]  lockdown like Shanghai, we've got to have people to enforce it. And I will tell you one of the
[1:21:11.360 --> 1:21:15.040]  ways they're going to do that. When you get, I was just talking to a friend of mine that was a
[1:21:15.040 --> 1:21:20.800]  West Point graduate. What happens when you get rid of all the people in the Army who are not going
[1:21:20.800 --> 1:21:27.200]  to take unlawful orders? And it's unlawful to force vaccinate to mandate a vaccine. It's in the
[1:21:27.200 --> 1:21:33.280]  Code of Federal Regulations, you can't mandate an experimental vaccine on the troops. So those
[1:21:33.280 --> 1:21:39.280]  officers and senior enlisted and people that are not willing to take unlawful orders are being
[1:21:39.280 --> 1:21:42.880]  pushed out of the military because they're refusing the vaccine or they're refusing to wear a mask,
[1:21:42.880 --> 1:21:49.680]  etc. Well, what are you left with? You're left with these, you know, mindless, I'm not mindless
[1:21:49.680 --> 1:21:55.680]  necessarily, but they're, they're, they're consciousness people that are willing to do
[1:21:55.680 --> 1:21:59.840]  illegal orders. And you've got the same thing in medicine now. No, but that's, I'm going to just
[1:21:59.840 --> 1:22:06.720]  interrupt you're so right. This is a sifting process to find biological androids, to find drones
[1:22:06.720 --> 1:22:10.640]  that will do whatever they're told to serve the system. They'll be thrown away once they've been
[1:22:10.640 --> 1:22:15.600]  used. It doesn't matter. This is a testing process to see who will submit. And the last two years
[1:22:15.600 --> 1:22:19.760]  of tyranny was just the beta test. They're getting ready to go operational. Please continue.
[1:22:20.720 --> 1:22:25.840]  Well, yeah, and that's what my, I was, it was mindless. My friend who had been an Army officer
[1:22:25.840 --> 1:22:29.760]  said that you're going to end up with the mindlessly obedient, which I thought, I told him,
[1:22:29.760 --> 1:22:34.160]  I said, can I save that term because that applies to the physicians too. You know, the physicians
[1:22:34.160 --> 1:22:40.960]  that are speaking out are basically saying, you know, don't, don't kill people with remdesivir.
[1:22:41.840 --> 1:22:45.760]  Don't run out and take a vaccine that's experimental that we don't know anything about.
[1:22:46.800 --> 1:22:51.040]  We've got some other treatments. Consider hyperbaric oxygen. Consider these other things that work.
[1:22:51.600 --> 1:22:55.600]  Ivermectin. We've approved you. This works. Here's the, here's the literature. I mean,
[1:22:55.600 --> 1:23:01.920]  this is not outrageous claims that we're making, but they, but they, but they're considering this
[1:23:01.920 --> 1:23:07.280]  misinformation and disinformation. And so once you de-license all of us, then what you're going
[1:23:07.280 --> 1:23:12.480]  to end up with are the, the doctors that follow state orders. And we've seen this before. I mean,
[1:23:12.480 --> 1:23:17.280]  you know, if you want Mengele, if you want the Nazi system of medicine, that's what you're going to
[1:23:17.280 --> 1:23:22.080]  end up with. Now the way that they're doing it, and I, and I'm sure this is true to a lot of
[1:23:22.080 --> 1:23:26.240]  industries, but the way they're doing it is important to understand for medicine because
[1:23:26.880 --> 1:23:30.560]  we as physicians are not going to be the ones that save ourselves to the most part.
[1:23:30.560 --> 1:23:35.680]  We've got to have people. It's really taking away patient rights. When we're gone, all you're
[1:23:35.680 --> 1:23:40.400]  going to have are the order, order followers. So it takes away your rights to other, other
[1:23:41.520 --> 1:23:45.920]  types of medicine. And again, they're now saying Google, the federal government, you name it,
[1:23:45.920 --> 1:23:50.720]  will literally give the directives and you'll just follow that. There's no more human discretion.
[1:23:50.720 --> 1:23:56.960]  It's all just medical tyranny. And I've heard from doctors in hospitals the reason they cannot
[1:23:56.960 --> 1:24:03.360]  go against the, the mandated protocols is it's artificial intelligence driven. It's AI.
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:08.320]  They don't have anybody to complain to. It's not like the chief of staff. They can't go and say,
[1:24:08.320 --> 1:24:12.560]  no, this is an AI that's given to them this, which is programmed by them for what they want,
[1:24:12.560 --> 1:24:15.280]  but they still blame it. Oh, we didn't do it. The AI did it.
[1:24:16.160 --> 1:24:20.560]  Right. I mean, at some point, people that are worried, there are some people speaking out now
[1:24:20.560 --> 1:24:24.640]  anonymously, because they're afraid of losing their jobs. And it's all I can say to them.
[1:24:24.640 --> 1:24:29.280]  I just want to say, let me get this right. You're afraid of losing your job at Auschwitz.
[1:24:29.280 --> 1:24:34.240]  You know, that's kind of where we are right now. But, but how they did this, we, we,
[1:24:34.240 --> 1:24:37.760]  people think that the state medical boards is there for your safety. That somehow
[1:24:37.760 --> 1:24:41.760]  by licensing physicians, they weed out the bad guys. No, by licensing physicians,
[1:24:41.760 --> 1:24:47.600]  they weed out the narratives they don't like. And what they've done is the state medical boards
[1:24:47.600 --> 1:24:54.320]  now are taking their, they're taking orders essentially from a new lobbying group. I don't
[1:24:54.320 --> 1:24:58.560]  remember. It's 10 years, 15 years old, the Federation of State Medical Boards. And these
[1:24:58.560 --> 1:25:05.120]  guys make guidelines and courses for medical board executives. It's a private lobbying organization,
[1:25:05.120 --> 1:25:10.000]  but it represents the state's attorneys who work for medical boards. So here's what they say.
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:13.600]  This is what they say that we're doing, that we should lose our license for, get ready for this.
[1:25:13.600 --> 1:25:18.480]  Physicians who generate and spread vaccine misinformation or disinformation are risking
[1:25:18.480 --> 1:25:23.040]  disciplinary action by state medical boards, including the suspension or revocation of
[1:25:23.040 --> 1:25:28.880]  their medical license. They must share information that is factual, scientifically grounded and
[1:25:28.880 --> 1:25:34.560]  consensus driven. Now, consensus driven science doesn't proceed by consensus. That's the opposite
[1:25:34.560 --> 1:25:38.800]  of science. Oh, there's a consensus to the world's flat. You've got to say it's flat or you're going
[1:25:38.800 --> 1:25:45.520]  to be kicked out of your job. Right. So I, years ago, you came up with the,
[1:25:47.360 --> 1:25:53.200]  years ago, you had the t-shirt that said, we're all Alex Jones now. And so, and you were exactly
[1:25:53.200 --> 1:25:58.160]  right. And I bought one of your t-shirts. So I wore it because it's coming to us next. And here
[1:25:58.160 --> 1:26:02.400]  it is. So maybe I'll have to have a t-shirt made for you that says we're all Dr. Lee Merritt now.
[1:26:02.400 --> 1:26:09.680]  Yes, ma'am. It's, it's what, it's basically their criminalizing speech. Come on now. You know, I do
[1:26:09.680 --> 1:26:15.920]  like what Elon Musk recently said, that if, if you allow people you don't like to say things you
[1:26:15.920 --> 1:26:21.600]  don't agree with, then we've got free speech. You know, it's, this is not being generated because
[1:26:21.600 --> 1:26:25.600]  we're harming patients. We're not, the boards are not getting complaints about our patients.
[1:26:26.240 --> 1:26:31.760]  The boards are taking the orders of this higher up. And this is just what happened in Nazi Germany.
[1:26:31.760 --> 1:26:36.960]  This is what happened in Russia. Well, that's right. Big pharma wants full control of the medical
[1:26:36.960 --> 1:26:41.760]  profession to carry out its operations. And it's involved in that. And it just saw the medical
[1:26:41.760 --> 1:26:49.520]  system stand up and the average medical worker, doctor, scientist, nurse say no. And so now they're
[1:26:49.520 --> 1:26:54.960]  trying to go through the boards to do this. The answer is change those boards, have the legislature
[1:26:54.960 --> 1:27:01.520]  stand up and, and, and, and have medical freedom. Yeah. And, and you asked about what do we do? You
[1:27:01.520 --> 1:27:06.800]  know, the bottom line is you can't give an inch anymore. We never could, but people were willing
[1:27:06.800 --> 1:27:11.760]  to kind of compromise some things thinking this would go away. It's not going away, guys. We
[1:27:11.760 --> 1:27:16.880]  have to, you know, don't, don't wear, don't ever put a mask back on. They're not healthy for you
[1:27:16.880 --> 1:27:22.800]  anyway. You know, for, for whatever reason, don't take any vaccines from, from these people. You
[1:27:22.800 --> 1:27:26.560]  know, I have people say to me, well, I'm not going to take the COVID vaccine, but I was shingles
[1:27:26.560 --> 1:27:31.200]  or something. I said, really, I'm not, I don't want to buy toothpaste from these psychopaths. Do
[1:27:31.200 --> 1:27:35.920]  not take their vaccines. You know, we don't know what is in them. Yeah, I'm glad people are clapping.
[1:27:35.920 --> 1:27:41.280]  But they censor does they silence does they covered up the bad effects. I wouldn't buy a
[1:27:41.280 --> 1:27:47.680]  glass of ice water from them. You can't trust anything they do. Well, and the ice water is a
[1:27:47.680 --> 1:27:52.880]  good point because, you know, with all this stuff about watch the water, it's the one thing you
[1:27:52.880 --> 1:27:57.680]  could poison would be bottled water. You know, so there's maybe some truth of that, all this stuff
[1:27:57.680 --> 1:28:02.640]  that comes in can all of our canned foods, all of our foods that have labels that have, have,
[1:28:03.520 --> 1:28:09.120]  you know, they've been slowly poisoning us for years, whether it was fluoride, it was bromine
[1:28:09.120 --> 1:28:13.280]  as a stabilization and wheat, we used to have iodine, which was a good thing. But after World
[1:28:13.280 --> 1:28:19.200]  War II, you know, suddenly we had bromine. What was that all about? It's a toxic halide. So they've
[1:28:19.200 --> 1:28:24.960]  been putting bad things in our food. So anything that's processed by man is dangerous. Thank you,
[1:28:24.960 --> 1:28:30.000]  big pharma, big egg together. Yeah, that's right. This is a real cult. Dr. Lee Merritt,

[1:32:05.840 --> 1:32:11.360]  Challenge. First of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny and for all the
[1:32:11.360 --> 1:32:16.400]  senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with
[1:32:16.400 --> 1:32:22.320]  fun spots or age spots as they're lovingly called. But since taking your x2 for the last couple of
[1:32:22.320 --> 1:32:29.920]  years, my skin is just really gorgeous. Actually, people think I'm 55 years old and I was already
[1:32:29.920 --> 1:32:34.240]  taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do
[1:32:34.240 --> 1:32:38.720]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation. But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't
[1:32:38.720 --> 1:32:44.400]  happen immediately. But you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know,
[1:32:44.400 --> 1:32:49.360]  this is a ticket. This is working. This is wonderful. You know, I don't, I don't have to
[1:32:49.360 --> 1:32:55.440]  put on derma blend anymore, you know. So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally
[1:32:55.440 --> 1:33:16.400]  cleared up my skin leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:16.400 --> 1:33:25.680]  Live from the info wars.com studios. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. The social
[1:33:25.680 --> 1:33:31.760]  engineers think you're stupid. They're hoping you don't research the facts of how the world works
[1:33:32.320 --> 1:33:38.720]  and start making decisions accordingly and warning others. Remember, the power structure is working

[1:35:36.320 --> 1:35:42.640]  and the bio labs and this whole big snake venom story and what you, what you make of that.
[1:35:44.640 --> 1:35:46.480]  Well, where do you want to start? You want to start with a snake?
[1:35:46.480 --> 1:35:48.800]  Wherever you want to begin, you've got the floor.
[1:35:49.920 --> 1:35:56.000]  Well, you know, I honestly have to say I, I, Brian Artis is my friend and he's a very smart
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:36:01.920]  guy and he's done a good job on this Remdesivir, but on bringing the awareness of it. But I don't
[1:36:01.920 --> 1:36:07.040]  think, I think there's some misheard song lyrics here. You know, the problem is that we have in
[1:36:07.040 --> 1:36:14.800]  our bodies a naturally occurring snake venom like chemical and it's used in the times of oxidative
[1:36:14.800 --> 1:36:19.760]  stress. And what they discovered at the University of Arizona is that in people that were getting
[1:36:19.760 --> 1:36:25.600]  really, really sick with COVID, then they had more of this. They had quite a bit more than
[1:36:25.600 --> 1:36:30.960]  people that were recovering from COVID, whatever we think COVID is, but that's, that's, that's what
[1:36:30.960 --> 1:36:36.320]  they discovered. And so from there, it kind of went from paper to paper to paper. But I really
[1:36:36.320 --> 1:36:43.280]  think the bottom line here is that, that snake venom is actually, actually been used for, for
[1:36:43.280 --> 1:36:48.800]  medicinal purposes. And there's a big difference. Let me just make this point, regardless of whether
[1:36:48.800 --> 1:36:55.040]  or not there is some hidden snake venom somewhere, the, the ability to put it in a water system is
[1:36:55.040 --> 1:37:01.200]  nil. The, first of all, the amount of snake venom it would take to kill somebody with that's called
[1:37:01.200 --> 1:37:06.000]  the LD 50, the dose at which it kills 50% of the animal or the human that we're talking about.
[1:37:07.120 --> 1:37:12.480]  When you inject it like a snake bites you, or you inject it through a needle is one thing to
[1:37:12.480 --> 1:37:17.680]  that to swallow it is a totally different issue. Your body breaks it down, it gets destroyed in
[1:37:17.680 --> 1:37:22.720]  the stomach acid, you'd have to give a huge wamping dose. And, you know, I looked at this,
[1:37:22.720 --> 1:37:27.760]  having looked at bio weapons issues since the 1980s, I can tell you that there's a reason the
[1:37:27.760 --> 1:37:33.040]  Soviets didn't look at seriously that I know of it poisoning our water supply. And the reason is
[1:37:33.040 --> 1:37:37.520]  because it's hard. I mean, it's almost impossible to do you'd have just so people understand what
[1:37:37.520 --> 1:37:42.720]  they should be and should not be worried about. You would have to go to every city, every little town
[1:37:43.280 --> 1:37:47.520]  to put something in the water. We're not all connected. That's number one. Number two,
[1:37:47.520 --> 1:37:53.840]  you'd have to either subvert or subdue or bribe or somehow the people that are involved in the water
[1:37:54.800 --> 1:37:59.280]  system, because these are locked facilities. You can't just walk in and dump stuff in there.
[1:37:59.280 --> 1:38:03.520]  Sure. Snake venom doesn't replicate. It's not the right weapons. I'm just wondering why this
[1:38:03.520 --> 1:38:10.080]  story has been pushed so much and why it's out there. Right. Now, what I'm going to get as we
[1:38:10.080 --> 1:38:14.800]  know, this was said before even covered was released. It's electromagnetic. It's the,
[1:38:14.800 --> 1:38:19.360]  it's the 5g and all the radiation. Is it that the main cause of all the sicknesses?
[1:38:19.360 --> 1:38:23.280]  I think that's what we got to be looking at. And so what I'm wondering is how much of this,
[1:38:23.280 --> 1:38:26.800]  not due to him, but maybe do, you know, it's interesting that he got a call
[1:38:26.800 --> 1:38:32.880]  from somebody that said, you know, what about venom or anti venom? And then they're desperate to
[1:38:32.880 --> 1:38:38.720]  give us off the bio lab. They're desperate to get us off electromagnetic stuff. Yeah. I would be,
[1:38:38.720 --> 1:38:42.320]  like I say, really, if you want to be concerned about something, the thing you could poison,
[1:38:42.320 --> 1:38:46.560]  and I'm not saying that they're above this is your bottled water. It turns out,
[1:38:46.560 --> 1:38:52.560]  bottled water has less stringent testing requirements than your tap water. You are
[1:38:52.560 --> 1:38:58.240]  better off with filtered tap water than you are with even the best quality top brands of bottled
[1:38:58.240 --> 1:39:03.440]  water. So that's, that's the bottom line here. You know, it could be done, but it'd be very hard
[1:39:03.440 --> 1:39:08.160]  to do anything in the water. So I think what we're, what we really need to pay attention to is,
[1:39:08.160 --> 1:39:14.720]  you know, in a worldview, we always thought that we were worried and what the, and I think we've
[1:39:14.720 --> 1:39:20.560]  been dis, we've been led astray into this worldview that we were worried about that there are
[1:39:20.560 --> 1:39:25.120]  terrorists out there and there are bio weaponaires out there. And someday enough of them will get
[1:39:25.120 --> 1:39:28.640]  together that there'll be an overlap and they'll talk and they'll coordinate their efforts and
[1:39:28.640 --> 1:39:34.080]  we'll have some cave somewhere making bio weapons kind of explain this governments are all obsessed
[1:39:34.080 --> 1:39:39.200]  with this is their obsessive power. This is really the keys to the future. That's why they keep doing
[1:39:39.200 --> 1:39:45.360]  this. Right. And so it turns out we're not dealing with terrorists, small numbers of people in a
[1:39:45.360 --> 1:39:50.640]  cave somewhere making a bio weapon. What we're dealing with who knew is kind of this rich globalist
[1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:56.960]  occultist pedophile network that has 80 to 90% of the corporate world wealth. And within that,
[1:39:56.960 --> 1:40:03.200]  they can fund these bio labs. Now, you know, and we as taxpayers, I'll tell you what I woke up to
[1:40:03.200 --> 1:40:08.400]  because I was at a freedom law school event and I started it by saying, you know, I just woke up
[1:40:08.400 --> 1:40:13.920]  to the realization that all my life I've paid taxes so that our government could pay for bio
[1:40:13.920 --> 1:40:20.000]  weaponaires to then develop a pathogen or a toxin to kill my children. You know, I'm kind of over
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:26.320]  that. To be honest, that's what happened. So if you go, the bio weapons, we've been dealing with
[1:40:26.320 --> 1:40:31.360]  bio weapons and studying this stuff since the first world war, but it really kicked off. I have to
[1:40:31.360 --> 1:40:38.080]  say it seems to me there was a real big acceleration in the early 80s. And ever since then, this whole
[1:40:38.080 --> 1:40:43.360]  talk about Ukraine and how everybody's surprised, what we really should be asking is why are these
[1:40:43.360 --> 1:40:50.880]  people that have been part of DARPA, BARDA, you know, the bio biologic aspect of kind of like DARPA,
[1:40:50.880 --> 1:40:56.320]  the defense threat reduction agency, all these different agencies. Why are they not coming?
[1:40:56.320 --> 1:41:00.240]  Why did they not come forward when this whole thing broke out in Wuhan and say, Hey, by the way,
[1:41:00.240 --> 1:41:04.640]  did you know there were a bio weapons lab surrounding the Russian Federation all over the
[1:41:04.640 --> 1:41:10.240]  place from these old Soviet? It isn't just Ukraine. There's there was and we've known about it because
[1:41:10.240 --> 1:41:17.040]  in 1991, you can go back and you can look the Nun Luger Act. The Nun Luger Act designated $400
[1:41:17.040 --> 1:41:25.200]  million a year for four years for us to go over our people, our staff, our specialists to go over
[1:41:25.200 --> 1:41:31.520]  and take over in the in the guise of cooperative threat reduction, CTR at that time, to go over
[1:41:31.520 --> 1:41:39.680]  and take over these bio weapons labs in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, the Luger Lab. Actually, they named
[1:41:39.680 --> 1:41:44.160]  one after Senator Luger. The Luger Lab was in Tbilisi or is in Tbilisi, Georgia.
[1:41:44.160 --> 1:41:48.240]  Well, that's what frustrates me is these labs were all bragged about the Washington Post and
[1:41:48.240 --> 1:41:55.600]  Obama funding them in Georgia, in Ukraine. And they turn and go, it's an insane conspiracy.
[1:41:55.600 --> 1:42:03.120]  They don't exist. It's all a lie. Well, and it goes back even far. I mean, yeah, they can,
[1:42:03.120 --> 1:42:07.120]  they don't want you to, they can't admit it because this is really ugly. I mean, when I go,
[1:42:07.120 --> 1:42:13.120]  I mean, why do they? Well, I mean, what I'm saying is they will admit in articles how great the labs
[1:42:13.120 --> 1:42:19.040]  are. And when we point them out, they say they don't exist. I know, I know, it's the disinformation
[1:42:19.040 --> 1:42:24.640]  counter Intel, but they, but, but they know they exist. And, you know, other people in, I remember
[1:42:24.640 --> 1:42:30.400]  in 2000, this is a DNA war. This is what I've been telling people, we are in this weird DNA war
[1:42:30.400 --> 1:42:34.240]  when they name, they never won't name wars till after the fact, but I call it the great DNA war
[1:42:34.240 --> 1:42:39.120]  against humanity, because I agree with you. Come back, you'll have the floor for 11 minutes, Dr.
[1:42:39.120 --> 1:42:45.920]  Lee Merritt, very powerful information. This is a DNA war. The global success with DNA. It is a war
[1:42:45.920 --> 1:42:50.800]  for the future, a war for our genetics with a spike protein that cuts that in two. We're going to
[1:42:50.800 --> 1:42:59.840]  hear from her with this critical information straight ahead. Ladies and gentlemen, I need your

[1:43:16.240 --> 1:43:21.360]  and de-platforming that cost tens of millions of dollars. And now with Bandot video getting close
[1:43:21.360 --> 1:43:27.200]  to 10 million views a day, we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups
[1:43:27.200 --> 1:43:33.920]  to be able to post their content free of charge. And because it's become so successful, it's a catch
[1:43:33.920 --> 1:43:40.480]  22 info wars and Bandot video have become a mothership promoting the pro human liberty movement
[1:43:40.480 --> 1:43:46.480]  worldwide. But the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter hundreds and

[1:47:09.280 --> 1:47:29.600]  as dr lee merit said the great dna war is here what is the dna war what are the world's ruling
[1:47:29.600 --> 1:47:37.920]  elites engaged in what is this biomedical tyranny dr lee merit well then some of this is my opinion
[1:47:37.920 --> 1:47:43.280]  the first part is my opinion then i'll tell you the facts my opinion is that if you really look at
[1:47:43.280 --> 1:47:49.440]  the world there are groups of people that have kept their bloodlines pure for millennia you
[1:47:49.440 --> 1:47:54.480]  know we thought it was cute when the when the royal houses for example all made sure that they
[1:47:54.480 --> 1:47:59.600]  looked at berks purge before they got married right what was that really all about you know it's
[1:47:59.600 --> 1:48:05.120]  kind of like the the old testament has the the who begat who begat who they want to know exactly
[1:48:05.120 --> 1:48:10.560]  where you come in there what bloodline you're from well now we have dna testing and and back in i
[1:48:10.560 --> 1:48:17.040]  remember back in 2000 there was a push the the the chinese complaint that some guys from harvard
[1:48:17.040 --> 1:48:22.960]  were over in china scavenging the chinese dna of course we denied it but they went out the chinese
[1:48:22.960 --> 1:48:29.200]  subsequently went out and they bought over 50 percent of the world's fastest genetic sequencers
[1:48:29.200 --> 1:48:34.320]  and they're under a project now to to sequence a million animals a million plants and a million
[1:48:34.320 --> 1:48:41.600]  people and then the next thing i remember was in 2017 putin and i remembered when this happened
[1:48:41.600 --> 1:48:46.720]  because i just thought it was weird putin complained that there was some military or some
[1:48:46.720 --> 1:48:53.280]  americans over there sampling dna from pure slavic people they had to make sure it was pure
[1:48:53.280 --> 1:48:59.280]  slavic people and we actually didn't deny that one it was our air force okay now our air force
[1:48:59.280 --> 1:49:05.040]  it was a neurosurgeon that was actually buying specimens he was he was able to extract csf from
[1:49:05.040 --> 1:49:10.400]  people along with some synovial tissue and that was there was a that we actually have i have on
[1:49:10.400 --> 1:49:15.840]  my computer so they wanted to raise specific bio weapon yeah very very specific they're looking at
[1:49:15.840 --> 1:49:20.960]  now the more recently the chinese have gotten caught sampling the uggers dna so you know
[1:49:20.960 --> 1:49:26.720]  everybody's into this game well then you've started seeing news articles come out that
[1:49:26.720 --> 1:49:33.440]  bio weapons could be designed to kill only people of particular race okay and in uh at one point
[1:49:33.440 --> 1:49:38.960]  they said that they the the chiefs of countries the presidents of countries around europe and
[1:49:38.960 --> 1:49:43.040]  and asia were worried that the americans had a way of preserving obama but killing all their
[1:49:43.040 --> 1:49:50.080]  leaders you know by gna and we caught the communist chinese through uh the youtube heads
[1:49:50.640 --> 1:49:55.840]  sister's company getting dna and that was later confirmed but they're really doing this right
[1:49:55.840 --> 1:49:59.360]  they're really doing this and remember when they are talking about conspiracy theorists
[1:49:59.360 --> 1:50:03.440]  they called us conspiracy theorists when they would say to you know people would ask me that i
[1:50:03.440 --> 1:50:08.400]  thought the pcr was safe and this this idea that well you're giving them your dna when you get a
[1:50:08.400 --> 1:50:14.400]  pcr test right we were concerned about that well what happened is in england there's a company
[1:50:14.400 --> 1:50:20.880]  called uh signpost spelled with a cig n signpost and they got caught selling three and a half million
[1:50:20.880 --> 1:50:27.200]  pcr tests with its dna to out to outsourced companies okay by the way you were on a year
[1:50:27.200 --> 1:50:31.840]  and a half ago and you said these pcr tests are getting your dna just three months ago it came out
[1:50:31.840 --> 1:50:37.920]  they were saving the dna all over the world confirmed illegally doing it totally vindicated
[1:50:37.920 --> 1:50:45.040]  again dr maren and again so much is happening we just moved past that it was okay but remember
[1:50:45.040 --> 1:50:51.360]  you know people remember one two three and me and uh ancestry dot com a new thing of sending in
[1:50:51.360 --> 1:50:55.680]  your blood and get your dna knowers they got us all i didn't do it but they got people to
[1:50:56.720 --> 1:51:02.560]  become part of this they wanted to know what it looks to me like is for 20 years is a map for a
[1:51:02.560 --> 1:51:08.400]  race specific bio attack they were making a map they had to determine what's different about our dna
[1:51:08.960 --> 1:51:13.520]  than than everybody else's dna and how can we exploit that well it turned out to be the ace
[1:51:13.520 --> 1:51:19.440]  two pathway and the ace two pathway is what this spike protein hooks into with an electromagnetic
[1:51:19.440 --> 1:51:26.160]  bond it's a chemical bond and not everybody hooks in the same so it turns out if you're a white
[1:51:26.160 --> 1:51:31.680]  european accepting finish um you have and i'm going to talk in little different numbers than the
[1:51:31.680 --> 1:51:35.760]  electromagnetic bond but it's this is the up regulation in one of the papers it's called new
[1:51:35.760 --> 1:51:42.400]  insights into genetic susceptibility of coven 19 and ace two and tm prss polymorphism analysis
[1:51:42.400 --> 1:51:48.320]  that's the paper but there's several papers out about this and they looked at uh what what happened
[1:51:48.320 --> 1:51:53.120]  in the binding capabilities and if you're a white european accepting finish finish or a different
[1:51:54.080 --> 1:52:00.800]  group we'll see they showed that they had a 56 percent up regulation of the ace two pathway in
[1:52:00.800 --> 1:52:06.720]  other words they bound the spike protein higher at the highest level okay then it drops down to
[1:52:06.720 --> 1:52:13.920]  african blacks and non-african blacks which bind at a uh 39 percent and then it drops way down to
[1:52:13.920 --> 1:52:19.360]  asians and finish it turns out the finisher from the korean peninsula who knew but they have the
[1:52:19.360 --> 1:52:23.600]  same binding affinity that the other asians do well that's right even their language is asian
[1:52:23.600 --> 1:52:28.720]  they've they've now reverse engineered it exactly so it hits it's northern whites and africans
[1:52:28.720 --> 1:52:34.080]  and then and then asians below that so it's a bio weapon a race specific weapon and then you get to
[1:52:34.080 --> 1:52:41.920]  the bottom which is zero and it's this group called the k26r now i probably am k26r because as it turns
[1:52:41.920 --> 1:52:47.680]  out as i said the royal houses are probably k26r this is the group the group that brought us this
[1:52:47.680 --> 1:52:52.720]  nightmare i hate to say it it's it's somewhat identifiable but not completely because this is
[1:52:52.720 --> 1:52:57.920]  a group that was all over the place intercalated into all other societies but it's the royal houses
[1:52:57.920 --> 1:53:04.720]  it's the big banking houses it turns out the amish um the ashkenazi jewish population but again it's
[1:53:04.720 --> 1:53:10.000]  not that everybody in these populations are evil it's that the people that are doing this though
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:15.760]  are in these populations they have this k26r genetics and they've kept it good you know most
[1:53:15.760 --> 1:53:22.560]  of us don't tell us what that genetic is uh manifestation is right well and it's it's that
[1:53:22.560 --> 1:53:29.840]  they have zero binding of the spike protein relative to this 56 percent that we do so um
[1:53:29.840 --> 1:53:35.760]  and and the only reason i think it's a mitochondrial dna uh passed down so from the mother's
[1:53:35.760 --> 1:53:41.040]  mitochondria so the reason i think i'm probably k26r is i got shed on i didn't get very sick my
[1:53:41.040 --> 1:53:47.040]  husband got really sick when i then shed on him and with this pathogen but i am the daughter of
[1:53:47.040 --> 1:53:49.920]  the daughter of the daughter of the daughter of the daughter or not the daughter of the daughter
[1:53:49.920 --> 1:53:54.480]  of the daughter of the duke of west failure so i probably got that royal mitochondrial dna
[1:53:54.480 --> 1:53:59.680]  because it just happens that i'm in the female line all the way down so that's how this works
[1:53:59.680 --> 1:54:06.240]  and it's it's a little bit creepy but i think that's what's going on and this thing is targeted
[1:54:06.240 --> 1:54:10.880]  and it may not make a huge difference in terms of people getting sick i actually talked to
[1:54:10.880 --> 1:54:17.440]  dr zelenko about this because he has a high uh because the ashkenazis are the ashkenazi are
[1:54:17.440 --> 1:54:22.800]  part of this and they but and i asked him did he see a difference but the problem he has is
[1:54:22.800 --> 1:54:26.880]  his entire population when he was treating people during the outbreak were ashkenazis
[1:54:26.880 --> 1:54:30.960]  and i was in the opposite side of the world where none of my people were ashkenazis so
[1:54:30.960 --> 1:54:35.440]  we didn't have anything to compare it to you know but it may not be a big deal for getting
[1:54:35.440 --> 1:54:40.480]  sick because there are so many other factors but it might be a big deal for sterility because
[1:54:40.480 --> 1:54:48.080]  we know that this spike protein in the vaccine is targeting the testicles the ovaries and your
[1:54:48.080 --> 1:54:55.840]  spleen and i think i think those are the big three so for and we know also that women are being shed
[1:54:55.840 --> 1:55:02.720]  on or having menstrual irregularities miscarriages um we're having a lot of stillbursts a lot of
[1:55:02.720 --> 1:55:08.960]  problems from the from this whole vaccination program so it may be that you're not spared the
[1:55:08.960 --> 1:55:14.720]  getting sick at all but you are spared having your children be sterilized by this and we may not be
[1:55:14.720 --> 1:55:20.160]  this this is the this is the it's it's a really biblical kind of issue here i think it's it's
[1:55:20.160 --> 1:55:27.600]  really ugly and and like i say um you know my neighbor for example down the street she's Mormon
[1:55:27.600 --> 1:55:34.000]  with six kids but but genetically she did one of those heredity things and genetically she's
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:40.080]  she's a hundred percent Ashkenazi she and her five kids that look like her did not get sick at all
[1:55:40.080 --> 1:55:45.280]  last year kind of like me and then then her husband and one boy that looks like him did
[1:55:45.280 --> 1:55:50.400]  who knows i mean that's a that's not a study that's an anecdote but i'm just saying there's
[1:55:50.400 --> 1:55:56.720]  something to this because they've gone incredibly out of their way to to search around in a very
[1:55:56.720 --> 1:56:02.080]  select you know when when putin complained about this in 2017 what he said was he said
[1:56:02.080 --> 1:56:06.160]  that when they kind of said oh you're just overreacting he said this is being done quite
[1:56:06.160 --> 1:56:11.200]  professionally they see we seem to be a subject of interest to them and it was being done quite
[1:56:11.200 --> 1:56:16.400]  professionally so this was not for nothing i also learned just recently from a brigadier general
[1:56:16.400 --> 1:56:22.320]  in the air force that did you know the air force had they're the number one service for genetic
[1:56:22.880 --> 1:56:27.840]  sequencers and i mean i guess i shouldn't be surprised by anything now but i guess i'm surprised
[1:56:27.840 --> 1:56:35.760]  that our our our military has genetic sequencers like for military purposes i guess absolutely
[1:56:35.760 --> 1:56:40.000]  the whole future of the world is dictating wrote 20 years ago and rebuilding america's
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:45.600]  defense of the p-nag is going to be race specific bio weapons so they can create a bio weapon even
[1:56:45.600 --> 1:56:50.400]  down to the individual so they're classing these weapons they're preparing these weapons they want
[1:56:50.400 --> 1:56:55.920]  to knock out western europe they want to knock out africa so it's the perfect weapon to depopulate
[1:56:55.920 --> 1:57:00.800]  africa while knocking out western europe that wants to promote freedom and then the globalist
[1:57:00.800 --> 1:57:07.440]  and the chai comms take over dr lee merit thank you so much for the time today and 30 seconds
[1:57:07.440 --> 1:57:15.280]  closing comment well remember the pnax said to us that uh that now that we have specific genotypes
[1:57:15.280 --> 1:57:19.680]  we can target that it will transform biologic warfare from the realm of terror to a politically
[1:57:19.680 --> 1:57:24.560]  useful tool these are our own people saying that hold on don't hang up do five more minutes
[1:57:24.560 --> 1:57:28.240]  with us and let you go and then we've got and then we're going to take calls after that i've
[1:57:28.240 --> 1:57:32.960]  opened the phone system up right now eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine eight
[1:57:32.960 --> 1:57:37.600]  seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine eight seven seven seven eight nine alex we'll do
[1:57:37.600 --> 1:57:42.400]  five more minutes with dr lee merit and then we will go to your phone calls straight ahead of
[1:57:42.400 --> 1:57:50.480]  what an incredible hour we have over a hundred designs of t-shirts that just sit there in our
[1:57:50.480 --> 1:57:55.520]  warehouse we need to sell those shirts to fund the operation but we'd already made some orders on
[1:57:55.520 --> 1:57:59.440]  future shirts coming in but these are all limited editions so once these new shirts come in we're
[1:57:59.440 --> 1:58:03.840]  going to sell those and that's it we'll have limited editions one at a time in the future
[1:58:03.840 --> 1:58:09.120]  and when they're gone they're gone well here's the new limited edition shirt this one is 2495
[1:58:09.120 --> 1:58:14.240]  really nice fabric alex jones was right on the front with a big red lightning bolt on the back
[1:58:14.240 --> 1:58:18.160]  info wars dot com you talk about triggering you talk about spreading the word you talk about
[1:58:18.160 --> 1:58:23.600]  waking people up alex jones was right fundraiser shirt we need the funds to operate info wars
[1:58:23.600 --> 1:58:28.400]  store dot com alex jones was right it's a gorgeous shirt we're really proud of it get a piece of
[1:58:28.400 --> 1:58:33.520]  history now at info wars store dot com or by calling toll free triple eight two five three three one
[1:58:33.520 --> 1:58:38.960]  three nine again be part of history support free speech be a maverick be a rebel you can't do that
[1:58:38.960 --> 1:58:44.480]  in a better way than wearing an alex jones was right shirt with info wars dot com big on the back
[1:58:44.480 --> 1:58:50.800]  available now for limited time info wars store dot com ladies and gentlemen info wars store dot
[1:58:50.800 --> 1:58:59.200]  com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20 year history and that is because the economy is
[1:58:59.200 --> 1:59:05.120]  breaking down inflation is exploding the supply chains have broken down and info wars is having
[1:59:05.120 --> 1:59:11.440]  serious trouble making its payroll and paying for operations and i do not want to implode or downsize
[1:59:11.440 --> 1:59:16.560]  in the face of the globalist making their main move in full wars its paradoxical is more popular
[1:59:16.560 --> 1:59:22.000]  than ever it is reaching more people than ever despite the censorship but because of cost increasing
[1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:26.480]  and having to run our own infrastructure and pay for our own bandwidth everything else we are running
[1:59:26.480 --> 1:59:33.600]  out of money so listen up to 75 percent on info wars store dot com on things like amazing patriot
[1:59:33.600 --> 1:59:40.000]  t-shirts that help spread the word and fund the operation on supplements on books on films everything
[1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:46.160]  is 25 to 75 percent off right now the biggest sell in our history at info wars store dot com thank you
[1:59:46.160 --> 1:59:55.120]  for your support leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:59:55.120 --> 2:00:11.840]  race specific bio warfare how do you release a bio weapon will kill everybody
[2:00:11.840 --> 2:00:17.120]  but not if it's race specific and there's been massive studying on it nick cheney wrote back
[2:00:17.120 --> 2:00:23.520]  in 2000 in april of 2000 they wanted to develop these things and deploy them and and now we know
[2:00:23.520 --> 2:00:31.360]  cover 19 and what it does targets northern europeans and africans and exempt some other groups below
[2:00:31.360 --> 2:00:35.520]  it what an incredible time to be alive so why are the chinese lock on their cities down to make
[2:00:35.520 --> 2:00:40.480]  sure they don't go to work to collapse economy this is a very sophisticated program and no doubt
[2:00:40.480 --> 2:00:47.280]  you're right dr lee merit the evidence shows this is a documented first use of race specific
[2:00:47.280 --> 2:00:53.440]  bio weapon what can you add to focusing closing on this incredibly important subject well don't
[2:00:53.440 --> 2:00:58.000]  don't blame just the chinese for the outbreak here because when we look at this there was
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:04.080]  in 2016 i believe it was there was a there was actually a seminar big and there's a book written
[2:01:04.080 --> 2:01:09.200]  about a big seminar on gain of function research and this talked about in there you find the the
[2:01:09.200 --> 2:01:15.600]  bio bio biography of dr michael callahan he's an infectious disease guy at harvard and i'm not
[2:01:15.600 --> 2:01:21.440]  trying to dot drop a dime on him but the fact is is that in 2002 or somewhere around there he was
[2:01:21.440 --> 2:01:27.760]  sent over to spearhead these soviet bio weapons labs that now were in the hands of us basically
[2:01:27.760 --> 2:01:33.120]  when the soviet union fell in 91 then after that all these socialist republics were starved for money
[2:01:33.120 --> 2:01:38.160]  we went over and we fed money to these guys we took over the bio weapons labs we staffed them and
[2:01:38.160 --> 2:01:43.520]  we experimented on their population we had we had the contracts we have the contractual agreements
[2:01:43.520 --> 2:01:49.600]  to be held harmless if people got killed or died by being guinea pigs in our in our study
[2:01:49.600 --> 2:01:57.120]  and what it says is what what his um what his his role in here was to quote reconfigure former
[2:01:57.120 --> 2:02:02.400]  biologic weapons production facilities in the former soviet union to accelerate drug and vaccine
[2:02:02.400 --> 2:02:06.480]  production and he was put in charge of gain of function programs for viral agents at these
[2:02:06.480 --> 2:02:11.680]  facilities additionally one of the things that they were doing is they were looking at bat
[2:02:11.680 --> 2:02:20.400]  coronavirus they were catalytic rising bats uh 10 000 species of bats it was a um us aid eco health
[2:02:20.400 --> 2:02:26.800]  alliance got together to do this and um one of the things that callahan published with a thai
[2:02:27.840 --> 2:02:32.800]  co-author that can't pronounce the name he's the first author um and callahan's still on the
[2:02:32.800 --> 2:02:38.480]  board i guess on the staff at the major university in thailand diversity of coronavirus in bats now
[2:02:38.480 --> 2:02:45.920]  this was in 2015 okay so um when we when we start looking at the players here it's hard to tell
[2:02:45.920 --> 2:02:51.680]  without a program but you've got all these players involved frank plumber up in winnipeg relph barrick
[2:02:51.680 --> 2:02:57.360]  in north carolina dr she and dr shoo and all these other guys from the wool on lab coming over and
[2:02:57.360 --> 2:03:04.880]  working in our in our lab in for detrick um we've got labs all over africa we've got labs all i mean
[2:03:04.880 --> 2:03:11.440]  again my conclusion from this is that we normal people our whole lives have been working thinking
[2:03:11.440 --> 2:03:19.040]  we were free and we were working and paying taxes so that the psychopaths uber lords in charge of
[2:03:19.040 --> 2:03:25.120]  this world could fund these guys to poison us and to and it's what can it be for is there anything
[2:03:25.120 --> 2:03:30.480]  other than depopulation and transhumanism that you can come up with i can't that's why my my new
[2:03:30.480 --> 2:03:36.080]  background for my talks is this dna behind me because it's they're not killing everybody they've
[2:03:36.080 --> 2:03:42.960]  got to they've got to have some robotic humans to continue to work and and be serfs and i think
[2:03:42.960 --> 2:03:48.800]  that's the transhumanist agenda so um but we'll get out of it we're gonna win because we're human
[2:03:48.800 --> 2:03:57.040]  and and that is it gives new meaning to some of the biblical points about the blood and i uh i think
[2:03:57.040 --> 2:04:03.600]  that we have we have something they want there's we have something that only humans have we have a
[2:04:03.600 --> 2:04:08.240]  direct connection with god and i think that's through our dna which is why they want to alter it
[2:04:08.240 --> 2:04:13.680]  that's right electrochemical control butterly merit amazing interview thank you so much for
[2:04:13.680 --> 2:04:20.720]  the time today join us again soon themedicalrebel.com thank you so much thank you thanks for having me on
[2:04:20.720 --> 2:04:28.080]  wow that was a powerful hour and it's live and the sensors can't stand the fact that millions
[2:04:28.080 --> 2:04:33.600]  of people are tuned in right now what but what really scares them is that once it's archived
[2:04:33.600 --> 2:04:39.200]  at man dot video you remember this and you go there and you get it and you share it and then
[2:04:39.200 --> 2:04:44.080]  millions more see it and then if they share it millions more see it and then they share it
[2:04:44.080 --> 2:04:50.400]  millions more and they're they're so afraid of that chain reaction that overrides their evil
[2:04:50.400 --> 2:04:54.080]  wicked scientific attack on humanity we'll be right back stay with us
[2:04:58.480 --> 2:05:05.760]  over the years info wars is produced more than 200 amazing patriot americana second
[2:05:05.760 --> 2:05:12.800]  amendment pro-liberty themed t-shirts ball caps flags you name all of the apparel and the flags
[2:05:12.800 --> 2:05:18.960]  are being sold at cost right now that's just regular plain chain shirts that is all sorts of
[2:05:18.960 --> 2:05:25.360]  designer shirts that cost us 15 20 25 dollars to produce we used to sell for 40 we're selling them
[2:05:25.360 --> 2:05:29.920]  for 15 selling for 20 whatever the shirt cost us the shirt costs five dollars we're selling it for
[2:05:29.920 --> 2:05:34.560]  five dollars for us actually produce the cost ten dollars we're selling for ten dollars and we've

[2:06:06.640 --> 2:06:13.680]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[2:06:19.440 --> 2:06:26.000]  well she did it again taylor lorenz the journalist who cried on camera about suffering ptsd over
[2:06:26.000 --> 2:06:32.400]  criticism of her journalism oh sorry no i mean bullying and harassment has just doxxed another
[2:06:32.400 --> 2:06:38.160]  private citizen in a hit piece for the washington post meet the person with the least self-awareness
[2:06:38.160 --> 2:06:44.400]  in the entire world you feel like any little piece of information that gets out on you will be used
[2:06:44.400 --> 2:06:51.440]  by the worst people on the internet to destroy your life it's overwhelming it's really hard
[2:06:51.440 --> 2:06:57.520]  her latest cry bully target libs of tiktok yeah taylor's latest courageous act of
[2:06:57.520 --> 2:07:02.800]  intrepid journalism was to stalk and track down the family of the owner of the libs of tiktok
[2:07:02.800 --> 2:07:08.800]  account in an attempt to doxxer identity lorenz proudly informed ronda centers' press secretary
[2:07:08.800 --> 2:07:14.240]  how she was planning to expose the woman behind the libs of tiktok account exposure for war all
[2:07:14.240 --> 2:07:21.040]  she does is post videos of leftists innately ranting on tiktok if your ideology is so progressive
[2:07:21.040 --> 2:07:27.360]  tolerant and wise why is it necessary to weaponize a huge legacy media outlet owned by a literal
[2:07:27.360 --> 2:07:33.520]  billionaire to target someone merely for amplifying that ideology quote several teachers have been
[2:07:33.520 --> 2:07:38.560]  fired as a result of being featured on the account but wait according to you lot cancel culture
[2:07:38.560 --> 2:07:44.480]  doesn't exist according to them whenever the mob gets a conservative fired it's just taking
[2:07:44.480 --> 2:07:49.440]  responsibility for their words and actions how is that any different from the role performed
[2:07:49.440 --> 2:07:55.440]  by libs of tiktok no it's not okay when you do it taylor lorenz is about to expose the private
[2:07:55.440 --> 2:07:59.840]  citizen behind some anonymous account on twitter and when people criticize her for it she and
[2:07:59.840 --> 2:08:05.040]  her friends will claim taylor is the real victim and anyone criticizing this type of journalism
[2:08:05.040 --> 2:08:09.680]  will be guilty of causing her trauma only the narcissists in corporate media could take someone
[2:08:09.680 --> 2:08:14.560]  who grew up in greenwich wealth and swiss boarding schools who regularly harms the lives of ordinary
[2:08:14.560 --> 2:08:19.840]  citizens with their massive journalistic platform and tell the public she's the victim and can't
[2:08:19.840 --> 2:08:23.840]  be criticized this is the framework corporate journalists are trying to construct and force
[2:08:23.840 --> 2:08:29.520]  you to accept they can criticize expose bully and destroy anyone they want no limits they're
[2:08:30.080 --> 2:08:36.800]  journalists you can't criticize how they use their power that's harassment lorenz then literally
[2:08:36.800 --> 2:08:42.400]  showed up on the doorstep of libs of tiktok's relatives to harass them this from the woman who
[2:08:42.400 --> 2:08:53.280]  cried on tv about harassment this from the woman who literally tweeted quote doxing stalking trying
[2:08:53.280 --> 2:08:58.480]  to hurt and smear people's loved ones threatening them it's not okay in any situation but it's okay
[2:08:58.480 --> 2:09:04.240]  when we do it it's okay when it's being published in a billionaire owned corporate media giant taylor
[2:09:04.240 --> 2:09:08.880]  lorenz mean tweets taylor lorenz showing up to people's homes and calling their family because
[2:09:08.880 --> 2:09:14.000]  of a name on twitter account virtually the entire article that lorenz then published in the washington
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:20.160]  post exposing libs of tiktok's name and location is just whining about how effective the account
[2:09:20.160 --> 2:09:26.000]  has been in derailing the groomer agenda oh but it's to protect the alphabet people who are apparently
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:31.920]  so downtrodden they require anyone who makes fun of them to be made an example of by one of the
[2:09:31.920 --> 2:09:37.600]  most powerful institutions in america oh my god so downtrodden lorenz's previous greatest hits
[2:09:37.600 --> 2:09:43.600]  include exposing the identities of pamela gellar's young daughters who weren't even political and
[2:09:43.600 --> 2:09:49.920]  who had been previously targeted along with geller herself by islamic terrorists but remember
[2:09:49.920 --> 2:09:53.360]  taylor lorenz is the real victim it's really hard
[2:09:57.040 --> 2:10:02.240]  this is savannah hernandez in downtown l.a i keep reading articles of people walking to parking
[2:10:02.240 --> 2:10:07.200]  garages and getting harassed and attacked let's go see if that's true i walk from that parking
[2:10:07.200 --> 2:10:12.720]  garage over to work every single day and just last month i was chased by a homeless man carrying a
[2:10:12.720 --> 2:10:17.920]  tree branch it's very lucky to make it into the courthouse in time so i do the same walk except
[2:10:17.920 --> 2:10:23.040]  i was actually in my car it was just like a couple weeks ago and a homeless guy tried to get into
[2:10:23.040 --> 2:10:28.640]  my car luckily my doors were locked but i've had a couple co-workers who felt threatened at one time
[2:10:28.640 --> 2:10:34.720]  by some homeless individuals but it was reported and we took some steps to uh walk to the train
[2:10:34.720 --> 2:10:39.680]  station as a group but that's about it being followed is like really common i call people
[2:10:39.680 --> 2:10:45.120]  they'll follow you and like i had a guy like following me home from school until like the last
[2:10:45.120 --> 2:10:49.680]  block from my house and he left and then it's like you know that's like a big problem we hear that
[2:10:49.680 --> 2:10:53.520]  he like even no matter what age you are you're still gonna get followed and like there's a lot
[2:10:53.520 --> 2:10:57.760]  of keeps around here yeah there's homeless people around there's not much we can do about it the
[2:10:57.760 --> 2:11:01.600]  city's been trying to do something about it but they don't seem to be getting much traction on it
[2:11:01.600 --> 2:11:06.560]  you get on town you're gonna have homeless people you're gonna have crackheads you know just keep an
[2:11:06.560 --> 2:11:10.240]  eye on your wallet are you guys kind of just used to the homelessness i mean what do you
[2:11:10.240 --> 2:11:13.760]  guys think about it i mean i think yeah i don't have you ever fully get used to it but i think
[2:11:13.760 --> 2:11:18.320]  there's some level of being desensitized like many other things right where when you encounter
[2:11:18.320 --> 2:11:22.880]  something a lot you kind of have to shut down a little bit but i mean i you know it still impacts
[2:11:22.880 --> 2:11:29.760]  me i get on a daily basis i've gotten pepper spray and um just try to stay as safe as we can with
[2:11:30.480 --> 2:11:35.760]  as little as we can um and not be too threatening to the homeless population because we are sympathetic
[2:11:35.760 --> 2:11:41.280]  to a lot of their issues but at the end of the day public safety comes first if people want to
[2:11:41.280 --> 2:11:46.400]  do crack let them do crack i haven't experienced any crime i've been pushed by a homeless person
[2:11:46.400 --> 2:11:51.920]  but it wasn't really a crime just kind of like into the street or yes into the street
[2:11:52.800 --> 2:12:00.720]  skid row is growing and further from its skid row sort of bounds like it's just everywhere now
[2:12:01.280 --> 2:12:08.080]  definitely expanded since the pandemic started i think it got bigger and you can see larger areas
[2:12:08.080 --> 2:12:14.880]  affected by all that now too how do you feel gavin newson's doing as your governor um i mean
[2:12:15.520 --> 2:12:19.840]  yeah it's a complicated question i like i mean i saw i work in education so i like some of the
[2:12:19.840 --> 2:12:25.040]  things he's done for like our budget in that regard for higher education um but i think in terms of
[2:12:25.040 --> 2:12:30.400]  like actually addressing issues of homelessness um all right that's just part of this really powerful
[2:12:30.400 --> 2:12:38.240]  report that is at band out of video and an info wars dot com and that is watch california residents

[2:21:40.320 --> 2:21:49.680]  day and i watched these uh five g towers being constructed and upgraded and it's kind of synergy
[2:21:49.680 --> 2:21:56.480]  because i heard dr maryk on your show months ago talking about the five g being the real weapon

[2:22:10.240 --> 2:22:19.120]  one of these towers and it's like a little power plant and and the wiring is there's 16 to 24
[2:22:20.000 --> 2:22:27.840]  fat cables going up these these towers and um they they are not for cell phone use they they are
[2:22:27.840 --> 2:22:34.160]  for much much more and uh i don't care you know i was talking to a guy and he told me that though
[2:22:34.160 --> 2:22:42.400]  they're just 80 watt you know for 80 amp cables and i'm like well 80 times 24 you know do the math
[2:22:42.400 --> 2:22:50.720]  on that you could power a small plant or a small tower that's what i was told 25 years ago i was
[2:22:50.720 --> 2:22:55.520]  told by a big engineer who came out of visit to me at the little tv studio and he said
[2:22:55.520 --> 2:23:02.560]  they're using the Doppler radar to ionize the atmosphere like harp and control the weather and
[2:23:02.560 --> 2:23:09.600]  then 20 years later like five years ago they come out and mainstream news admit Doppler radar but
[2:23:09.600 --> 2:23:14.880]  with like 10 times the power is used to control the weather so absolutely i have articles admitting
[2:23:14.880 --> 2:23:20.560]  five g can manipulate the human brain you're absolutely right every they're everywhere i mean
[2:23:20.560 --> 2:23:27.200]  they are every mile or two i mean i can see two or three of them at all times coming across the
[2:23:27.200 --> 2:23:31.360]  yeah they got a grid to just literally turn people off i think maybe we'll just have a convulsion if
[2:23:31.360 --> 2:23:38.880]  they want they put weapon systems in everywhere when dr mary hiding inside the white poles everything
[2:23:39.840 --> 2:23:44.480]  yes yes they're starting to put the poles up that the wiring is all inside of them
[2:23:45.200 --> 2:23:50.320]  you know so it's really something that it's an alien takeover brother you can call it what you
[2:23:50.320 --> 2:23:54.880]  want but it's definitely anti-human thank you great great points all right who's up next

[2:24:41.760 --> 2:24:48.160]  curcuminoid compound out there we're very proud of it so thank you oh thousand percent well the
[2:24:48.160 --> 2:24:51.760]  reason why i called in sir is because um you know it started with the second amendment i believe
[2:24:51.760 --> 2:24:55.760]  it's going to end with the second amendment uh i one of the first purchases i ever made from you
[2:24:55.760 --> 2:25:01.760]  years ago was lez adam the second amendment primer and i started reading it again a few
[2:25:01.760 --> 2:25:06.080]  days before the shooting in new york and the reason why i'm bringing this up is you know my
[2:25:06.080 --> 2:25:10.000]  fiance she's beat me and it looked like it was you know a bunch of asians that were targeted
[2:25:10.000 --> 2:25:15.200]  during that new york thing and that's why her and i go nowhere without our second amendment
[2:25:15.200 --> 2:25:19.760]  underneath our shirt with our concealed carry and she is extremely proficient in it and i just
[2:25:19.760 --> 2:25:26.480]  want to let everybody know who can hear my voice that is why precisely along with many other reasons
[2:25:26.480 --> 2:25:30.640]  why you should be proficient in firearms why you should own firearms and why you can never relinquish
[2:25:30.640 --> 2:25:36.720]  your firearms because without them we found stand vulnerable to any kind of tyranny that wants to
[2:25:36.720 --> 2:25:41.920]  impose itself upon us and one of the quotes out of uh lez adam's book i don't want to take up too
[2:25:41.920 --> 2:25:46.720]  much time it's the first page in the book it says the great ideals of liberty and equality are
[2:25:46.720 --> 2:25:52.240]  preserved against the assaults of opportunism the expediency of the passing hour the erosion of small
[2:25:52.240 --> 2:25:57.680]  encroachments the scorn and derision of those who have no patience with general principles by enshrining
[2:25:57.680 --> 2:26:02.640]  them in constitutions and consecrating to the task of their protection a body of defenders
[2:26:02.640 --> 2:26:08.240]  i wanted to bring that to everybody's attention because now more than ever you should be getting
[2:26:08.240 --> 2:26:14.320]  out there women especially my lady goes nowhere without it i go nowhere without it it's fun too
[2:26:14.320 --> 2:26:18.880]  and it's a conversation starter and it's really honestly no brother it's beautiful and thank you
[2:26:18.880 --> 2:26:24.720]  so much alex for your testimony all right let's go ahead take another call here we have a caller who

[2:33:32.460 --> 2:33:38.140]  The big private central bank, owned by the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers, the Saxe
[2:33:38.140 --> 2:33:44.440]  Coburg, Goethos and others, they just create unlimited money for themselves and
[2:33:44.440 --> 2:33:47.640]  then they get us to jump through all these hoops to be able to live and take care
[2:33:47.640 --> 2:33:52.880]  of our children. And now they're engaged in inflation and hyperinflation to
[2:33:52.880 --> 2:33:58.560]  literally destroy the savings of the general public and impoverish you. And so
[2:33:58.560 --> 2:34:01.920]  when I get up here and I ask listeners for support, I'm just pointing out that
[2:34:01.920 --> 2:34:06.200]  we're not running this system and we're not censoring you and we're not trying
[2:34:06.200 --> 2:34:10.680]  to silence you and we're trying to promote your freedom so we're in this
[2:34:10.680 --> 2:34:14.520]  together. And I don't like coming to you and saying I need your support or we'll
[2:34:14.520 --> 2:34:19.080]  be shut down, but that's where we are. We're taking on the globalist in a major
[2:34:19.080 --> 2:34:24.840]  fight. So I'm encouraging all viewers, all listeners, everybody that has seen the
[2:34:24.840 --> 2:34:32.400]  history of M4 wars and all the lore and the bohemian grove being exposed in 911
[2:34:32.400 --> 2:34:42.360]  and the Iraq war and Obama and the Clintons and COVID-19 and everything
[2:34:42.360 --> 2:34:48.200]  we've gone through to realize that they think you're gonna get used to this
[2:34:48.200 --> 2:34:52.040]  fight and become kind of asleep to the war and having your liberty taken and
[2:34:52.040 --> 2:34:56.520]  like just get used to being in a war so long you kind of just give in. No, those
[2:34:56.520 --> 2:35:01.360]  that win the war get that it's a long-term battle and commit harder and
[2:35:01.360 --> 2:35:05.880]  harder and harder as it gets deeper. And that's where we are. This is not

[2:38:21.160 --> 2:38:27.640]  knew because I knew this was gonna happen but unbelievable unbelievable. Well sir I
[2:38:27.640 --> 2:38:33.640]  mean look here's the deal this is not a vaccine it is a GMO gene altering that

[2:38:50.960 --> 2:38:58.120]  but it's all our jobs to warn everyone as much as we can. Absolutely and I have
[2:38:58.120 --> 2:39:02.520]  family members that have taken the shots and so far so good they knock on wood
[2:39:02.520 --> 2:39:07.240]  but I can see like they've had some of side effects like severe headache from
[2:39:07.240 --> 2:39:12.960]  the third shot. Well that's the thing is most of us placebo for now we know
[2:39:12.960 --> 2:39:17.480]  that from studies it's beta testing though it's seeing what will people
[2:39:17.480 --> 2:39:22.240]  submit to will they say the state has control of our bodies think about that
[2:39:22.240 --> 2:39:26.760]  God bless you Stephen thank you so much sir that's a man standing up for what's
[2:39:26.760 --> 2:39:32.880]  right but we're all gonna be in this position soon China and other places
[2:39:32.880 --> 2:39:36.800]  have already fallen we sit here in places like America that still have some
[2:39:36.800 --> 2:39:42.720]  basic freedom while they tell us how bad America is think about how bad it would
[2:39:42.720 --> 2:39:48.040]  be if you weren't here thank your lucky stars I was born here today it's like
[2:39:48.040 --> 2:39:52.320]  that Lee Greenwood song proud to be an American in fact I want to come in first
[2:39:52.320 --> 2:39:56.520]  five minutes the next hour and I want to play that because America isn't perfect
[2:39:56.520 --> 2:40:00.280]  but the globalist hate it because it says an idea of freedom and it is a dream
[2:40:00.280 --> 2:40:04.160]  of freedom it's a vision of freedom and what we envision we end up building
[2:40:04.160 --> 2:40:09.600]  all right we got William we got Doug we got Jack we got Rudy we got Kareem and
[2:40:09.600 --> 2:40:14.400]  Jay let's go to Kareem first Kareem thanks for holding from California on the
[2:40:14.400 --> 2:40:19.960]  air how you doing Alex man I'm in the thick of the war now brother
[2:40:19.960 --> 2:40:26.880]  to not speak to you this and Alex we got to identify these globalists publicly do
[2:40:26.880 --> 2:40:30.280]  you know that there's a carnal offspring of that tree that was a knowledge of good
[2:40:30.280 --> 2:40:35.320]  need that's an entity that's a man but it's an angel and he had sex with Eve and
[2:40:35.320 --> 2:40:38.800]  his kids are running the planet into the ground that's who they are when Christ
[2:40:38.800 --> 2:40:42.760]  said you are your father he didn't mean that as a figure of speech the word is
[2:40:42.760 --> 2:40:47.400]  carnal offspring meaning Genesis he said I'll put in you said you have your
[2:40:47.400 --> 2:40:52.760]  father and then you love death right they love death because the ground will
[2:40:52.760 --> 2:40:57.040]  not yield to them he told that snake the ground will not yield to you the her
[2:40:57.040 --> 2:41:01.720]  strength from henceforth after came to label he's a literal carnal offspring of
[2:41:01.720 --> 2:41:06.400]  his daddy that's why nobody understands these guys they are Luciferians they are
[2:41:06.400 --> 2:41:09.880]  the synagogue of Satan because they're there is kids carnal offspring is the
[2:41:09.880 --> 2:41:16.440]  word see and you're right they can't help it they want to kill us right they
[2:41:16.440 --> 2:41:20.520]  cannot tell you food or medicine they have to synthesize it because they want
[2:41:20.520 --> 2:41:24.680]  the ground will not yield to them that's Genesis 412 that's why Bill Gates is
[2:41:24.680 --> 2:41:29.880]  buying all that land because they have to sell you poison as medicine that's
[2:41:29.880 --> 2:41:34.600]  their way to get back a father God who who who cursed the ground to Cain Cain is
[2:41:34.600 --> 2:41:39.840]  the literal carnal offspring and that's what that word seed is okay when he's
[2:41:39.840 --> 2:41:45.000]  out to me between your seed and her seed that word is there it means carnal when
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:50.400]  you when you go to Matthew 13 he goes tell us the parable of the the tears he
[2:41:50.400 --> 2:41:53.880]  goes the tears of the children of the wicked one and the enemy that stone him
[2:41:53.880 --> 2:42:00.040]  is the devil that word is broadcast it's sperm us 46 90 and the Greek that's
[2:42:00.040 --> 2:42:03.240]  car when he said you have your father the devil murder from the beginning that's
[2:42:03.240 --> 2:42:08.080]  carnal offspring that's not figure of speech that's why nobody can figure these
[2:42:08.080 --> 2:42:12.680]  people out so the antichrist is coming it's a fake show it's a fake Jesus you're
[2:42:12.680 --> 2:42:16.360]  not gonna fall for it because you know you do the work but I just want to
[2:42:16.360 --> 2:42:21.000]  identify these guys biblically they're his kids they're his literal offspring and
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:23.600]  that's why they're doing all these things the sorcery the pharmacia when I
[2:42:23.600 --> 2:42:27.960]  called prior and then we went over that it's sorcery which is pharmacy
[2:42:27.960 --> 2:42:32.560]  pharmacia they're the pharmacist of the world and they also control the banking
[2:42:32.560 --> 2:42:38.840]  of course through the contract a covenant with death 1913 so the whole
[2:42:38.840 --> 2:42:43.960]  world is on that path but they just don't know identify these guys biblically
[2:42:43.960 --> 2:42:47.200]  when Christ said oh I know them they say they are Jews are sent it out of
[2:42:47.200 --> 2:42:51.040]  faith I'm quoting scripture I'm not anti-Semite Kareem powerful appreciate

[2:47:48.840 --> 2:47:54.320]  great to have you here with us hey thanks a lot been a longtime listener and
[2:47:54.320 --> 2:47:59.280]  buying your products the winter sun is great for my dad he's 90 and he can't
[2:47:59.280 --> 2:48:04.760]  take pills so it's a really a good product thank you I was reading the
[2:48:04.760 --> 2:48:08.880]  book called the conspirator's hierarchy the story of the committee of 300 by
[2:48:08.880 --> 2:48:13.960]  dr. John Coleman on page powerful book I read it 30 years ago tell people about
[2:48:13.960 --> 2:48:19.400]  it says that again John Coleman the committee of 300 yeah it was written 30
[2:48:19.400 --> 2:48:25.360]  years ago by an XMI 6 agent and on page 164 it says the United States will be
[2:48:25.360 --> 2:48:30.200]  flooded by peoples of alien cultures who will eventually overwhelm white
[2:48:30.200 --> 2:48:35.200]  America and that's not being racist people with no concept of what the United
[2:48:35.200 --> 2:48:40.040]  States Constitution stands for who will in consequence do nothing to defend it
[2:48:40.040 --> 2:48:44.280]  well yeah it's a tower of Babel it's people from everywhere so we're all
[2:48:44.280 --> 2:48:49.840]  divided yeah right that the word tower means mine so that's the tower of
[2:48:49.840 --> 2:48:54.680]  confusion the mind of confusion it's John the Baptist head the perfect mind of
[2:48:54.680 --> 2:49:00.360]  God mingled in the cup or the mind of the great whore the Catholic Church and
[2:49:00.360 --> 2:49:05.720]  her daughters that's the cup full of abomination it just was going along with
[2:49:05.720 --> 2:49:10.800]  what the guy was saying before you know down in Arizona you got the Lucifer
[2:49:10.800 --> 2:49:15.920]  telescope being run by the Jesuit order waiting for their alien savior you know
[2:49:15.920 --> 2:49:22.440]  a reverse of a radio telescope is a heart system and you can control people's
[2:49:22.440 --> 2:49:27.040]  minds through a heart system and as a hundred mile radius it says don't go in
[2:49:27.040 --> 2:49:31.560]  the desert you know if he says in the desert don't go and so if you even go
[2:49:31.560 --> 2:49:37.600]  there you can become under control by their heart system and you know you're
[2:49:37.600 --> 2:49:43.960]  mingling paganism with Christianity when Christ's robe is pure it's not sewn
[2:49:43.960 --> 2:49:48.680]  together by teams it's not the beggars quote not the patchwork garment the
[2:49:48.680 --> 2:49:53.320]  tears are the same tears they're on Christ's skin while he hangs on the
[2:49:53.320 --> 2:49:58.240]  cross they're reigning the reigning kings of the earth who believe lived
[2:49:58.240 --> 2:50:03.480]  deliciously with her bringing their false testimony of the torn up testimony
[2:50:03.480 --> 2:50:07.280]  of Jesus Christ they're the ones that are creating all the confusion in the
[2:50:07.280 --> 2:50:13.760]  world and so that's where you get the flowers and the flowers on Aaron's
[2:50:13.760 --> 2:50:18.600]  rod that buttered inside of the Ark of the Covenant all right powerful thanks
[2:50:18.600 --> 2:50:22.440]  for the call brother all right next up in the order they're received Rudy in
[2:50:22.440 --> 2:50:30.520]  Connecticut thank you Rudy for calling hi Alex over you man I am living the
[2:50:30.520 --> 2:50:36.800]  nightmare it is getting crazy well I just want to start out by saying that I
[2:50:36.800 --> 2:50:41.640]  was also terminated for declining the vaccination I was a journalist for over
[2:50:41.640 --> 2:50:45.320]  30 years and one of the wards and everything in my whole career was just
[2:50:45.320 --> 2:50:51.640]  ended over this vaccination wow that's so wrong brother
[2:50:55.200 --> 2:50:59.160]  you wanted to talk about NATO expansion mass shootings of medical
[2:50:59.160 --> 2:51:06.680]  training yes Rudy's gone thank you Rudy I appreciate your call okay let's go next
[2:51:06.680 --> 2:51:13.800]  to Jack in Wisconsin Jack and we'll go to Doug and Jay Jack welcome hello either
[2:51:13.800 --> 2:51:18.640]  of all the red pills I'm a huge fan of yours I was wondering what your thoughts
[2:51:18.640 --> 2:51:25.040]  were on a couple things I saw in tic-tac lore of Native American Navajo
[2:51:25.040 --> 2:51:31.000]  Comanche I'm not sure stories of alien providing support against cowboys but
[2:51:31.000 --> 2:51:35.280]  the twist was that they were god-believing aliens which I thought
[2:51:35.280 --> 2:51:40.280]  was interesting and then a lot of wild stuff on tic-tac brother I didn't see
[2:51:40.280 --> 2:51:46.000]  that but who knows yeah you know I know you're the conspiracy theory guy that's
[2:51:46.000 --> 2:51:49.000]  why I listened to you and that's why I'm so shocked with Sandy Hook it's like
[2:51:49.000 --> 2:51:53.080]  your conspiracy theory guy and they're blaming an apple for being an apple
[2:51:53.080 --> 2:51:58.800]  anyways no the whole Sandy Hook thing is this I covered thousands of things I
[2:51:58.800 --> 2:52:02.480]  barely ever covered that Hillary Clinton ran against Trump on Sandy Hook and
[2:52:02.480 --> 2:52:06.160]  said he was a Sandy Hook guy we questioned it of course we did had a
[2:52:06.160 --> 2:52:10.880]  lot of anomalies then they made it oh Alex Jones is against kids his shows
[2:52:10.880 --> 2:52:15.760]  about Sandy Hook people on the street go stop talking about Sandy Hook we don't
[2:52:15.760 --> 2:52:19.720]  talk about it we hardly ever talked about it it's their excuse to in free
[2:52:19.720 --> 2:52:24.320]  speech oh look dead kids give us your guns give us your free speech and then
[2:52:24.320 --> 2:52:28.120]  and that's basically it it has nothing to do with reality yeah and you're a
[2:52:28.120 --> 2:52:31.320]  radio guy though but like it's different because you're a radio guy and
[2:52:31.320 --> 2:52:35.440]  you're a radio guy who specifically deals and out there conspiracy wild stuff
[2:52:35.440 --> 2:52:39.280]  and that's all he did was listen to the internet questioning it and I would do
[2:52:39.280 --> 2:52:44.280]  it again I said Jesse Small it was fake WMDs were fake I was right the internet
[2:52:44.280 --> 2:52:47.440]  didn't believe Sandy Hook I questioned it it's my right to do it that's why
[2:52:47.440 --> 2:52:52.480]  they're rigging the courts with default judgments where I'm guilty then a jury
[2:52:52.480 --> 2:52:56.080]  decides how guilty because they can't have a real case that's what they're
[2:52:56.080 --> 2:53:01.960]  doing is anti-American and in the end it's not gonna work yeah yeah I'm sorry
[2:53:01.960 --> 2:53:05.400]  for bringing it up I got no I mean I know the point is we don't bring it up
[2:53:05.400 --> 2:53:12.640]  because it's not who we are they live off info wars we don't live off them yeah
[2:53:12.640 --> 2:53:16.040]  yeah the other thing that I wanted to bring up to Joe Rogan has brought it up
[2:53:16.040 --> 2:53:19.360]  too in the article change Wikipedia changed the article about it was with
[2:53:19.360 --> 2:53:24.840]  operation midnight climax and I think it needs to be brought up nowadays where
[2:53:24.840 --> 2:53:30.960]  you know they can use a sex weaponized hotties and also mind-altering drought you
[2:53:30.960 --> 2:53:34.640]  know not only the poison people for example they have like face-eating
[2:53:34.640 --> 2:53:39.320]  chemicals found sure for what people know about MK ultra operation nightmare
[2:53:39.320 --> 2:53:44.880]  climax was an MK ultra program running prostitutes in LSD yeah midnight
[2:53:44.880 --> 2:53:49.560]  climax and you know they would also like have people you know like you know
[2:53:49.560 --> 2:53:54.480]  guys who get really in the mood and then what did I call it when you said midnight
[2:53:54.480 --> 2:54:01.160]  climax what did I call it I don't know I don't know it just happened though I don't
[2:54:01.160 --> 2:54:05.960]  like it but yeah that's even worse then the last thing I want to hear your
[2:54:05.960 --> 2:54:09.120]  opinion because you brought it up many times before you're very prescient about
[2:54:09.120 --> 2:54:13.760]  it was the you know you hated the smell of dust mites and you know mites and
[2:54:13.760 --> 2:54:18.000]  dust mites to easily produce bio weapons because you can just get like a
[2:54:18.000 --> 2:54:22.240]  island with a bunch of people who are sick on it or like a nasty place and
[2:54:22.240 --> 2:54:27.120]  just have them get mites like how Fauci put the mites and the burying flies on
[2:54:27.120 --> 2:54:32.800]  dogs and then you take those mites off and you can spread it on birds spread it
[2:54:32.800 --> 2:54:37.880]  on other animals you're right imagine I'm not saying do this but imagine Fauci
[2:54:37.880 --> 2:54:43.520]  chained up with burrowing worms and flesh-eating worms and Fauci instead of
[2:54:43.520 --> 2:54:48.800]  those beagles imagine Fauci chained up in a room being eaten by flesh-eating
[2:54:48.800 --> 2:54:54.920]  worms yeah here's ours while we're he's worse than Hitler

[2:57:42.560 --> 2:57:45.440]  to bring it down America
[2:57:46.160 --> 2:57:50.720]  it's about 25 years ago that I wanted to expand in for worse I've been on the air
[2:57:50.720 --> 2:57:54.800]  a couple of years but I only had money to finance my own simple little local
[2:57:54.800 --> 2:57:58.120]  radio show and I wanted to hire camera people I wanted to make films I wanted
[2:57:58.120 --> 2:58:02.160]  to really challenge the globalist and it was a t-shirt I designed the first one
[2:58:02.160 --> 2:58:07.560]  mass murderers agreed gun control works that helped us finance hiring the first
[2:58:07.560 --> 2:58:11.480]  three members of my crew that's our oldest design and we still sell it we
[2:58:11.480 --> 2:58:15.240]  have that design over a hundred others that will now all be limited issues
[2:58:15.240 --> 2:58:19.520]  because whatever stuff we've got in that's it we're selling everything out
[2:58:19.520 --> 2:58:23.560]  to find the operation to get rid of inventory we'll still have some teachers
[2:58:23.560 --> 2:58:27.040]  in the future they'll just be limited editions and short runs so if you want
[2:58:27.040 --> 2:58:30.720]  to get any of these historic shirts this is your last chance when almost forgot

[2:58:45.760 --> 2:58:50.600]  ladies and gentlemen I need your help I need your help keeping info wars on the
[2:58:50.600 --> 2:58:55.320]  air and strong I need your help making sure that our mission continues on I
[2:58:55.320 --> 2:59:00.280]  was born for this you were born for this and people are really waking up right
[2:59:00.280 --> 2:59:04.000]  now but we had to build our own infrastructure because of the censorship
[2:59:04.000 --> 2:59:08.400]  and de-platforming that cost tens of millions of dollars and now with band
[2:59:08.400 --> 2:59:12.200]  dot video getting close to 10 million views a day we're a platform for
[2:59:12.200 --> 2:59:16.560]  thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their
[2:59:16.560 --> 2:59:22.560]  content free of charge and because it's become so successful it's a catch 22
[2:59:22.560 --> 2:59:27.920]  info wars and band dot video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human
[2:59:27.920 --> 2:59:32.640]  liberty movement worldwide but the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions
[2:59:32.640 --> 2:59:35.840]  of dollars a quarter hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a
[2:59:35.840 --> 2:59:39.640]  month so the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now the mega
[2:59:39.640 --> 2:59:44.040]  emergency blowout sale up to 75% off getting credible products and keep
[2:59:44.040 --> 2:59:47.320]  info wars as strong as ever
[2:59:47.320 --> 3:00:15.120]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[3:00:15.120 --> 3:00:30.480]  and that's what they hate ladies and gentlemen because once we give up on
[3:00:30.480 --> 3:00:34.960]  America all the other evil systems is coming and take over doesn't mean
[3:00:34.960 --> 3:00:40.240]  America's perfect but Bill of Rights the Constitution humans made by God not the
[3:00:40.240 --> 3:00:45.440]  state that is so critical jay in Kentucky before I go to Doug in Connecticut to
[3:00:45.440 --> 3:00:51.120]  finish up before Wayne Allen root takes over the the God connection tell me
[3:00:51.120 --> 3:00:57.200]  about that yeah I was gonna say it was the fusion the fusion the magnesium and
[3:00:57.200 --> 3:01:02.800]  the turbo force it's a good combination it is but the God connection no such
[3:01:02.800 --> 3:01:09.200]  things as coincidence because as I was sitting down during Shabbos Saturday
[3:01:09.200 --> 3:01:17.760]  Shabbos with the rabbi we were talking about the as as cross militia there over
[3:01:17.760 --> 3:01:23.400]  in the Ukraine and he was all ears and usually you know I listened to the
[3:01:23.400 --> 3:01:29.120]  rabbi but this guy here he was listening to me and I actually and you
[3:01:29.120 --> 3:01:33.640]  don't really discuss anything other than well than than God in the holiday but
[3:01:33.640 --> 3:01:39.280]  he was curious to know and about this information and I told him to go to band
[3:01:39.280 --> 3:01:46.120]  dot video you know and you guys can't go nowhere and and and I contribute every
[3:01:46.120 --> 3:01:51.200]  week and I buy something every week but you're beautiful brother yeah they as
[3:01:51.200 --> 3:01:55.840]  all battalion are Nazis they would deny that now and I just shows the left is
[3:01:55.840 --> 3:02:00.440]  constantly involved in racial division and evil Jay thank you so much and God
[3:02:00.440 --> 3:02:04.960]  bless you all right Doug in Connecticut last caller before we Allen root who's

[3:02:22.120 --> 3:02:27.120]  I'm absolutely positive that some years ago I'm the one that started the Alex
[3:02:27.120 --> 3:02:31.160]  Jones was right slogan on the YouTube probably you brother tell us how you
[3:02:31.160 --> 3:02:35.640]  did it well I've been a retired cop for eight years my wife's a teacher and she
[3:02:35.640 --> 3:02:39.520]  come home exhausted every day I'm gonna stay at home dad and I'd be like man you
[3:02:39.520 --> 3:02:43.200]  wouldn't believe what Alex covered today and blah blah blah and she thought I was
[3:02:43.200 --> 3:02:46.080]  nuts until the election was stolen and then it was like somebody gave her
[3:02:46.080 --> 3:02:51.040]  smelling salts boom she woke up so I wouldn't tell her I'm like you know what
[3:02:51.040 --> 3:02:57.920]  this dude's got the hand to God on him for sure and I'm tall as I can say there
[3:02:57.920 --> 3:03:02.720]  needs to be a statue of him minimum of at least in Texas but probably all over
[3:03:02.720 --> 3:03:06.360]  the country then you know the day that you do leave the planet the statue needs
[3:03:06.360 --> 3:03:10.840]  to go there and all it has to say on the bottom is the date you were born at date
[3:03:10.840 --> 3:03:15.480]  you left and then slogan on the bottom Alex Jones was right and in all the
[3:03:15.480 --> 3:03:20.320]  chat rooms you or I or your fans would watch my name on YouTube is the electric
[3:03:20.320 --> 3:03:24.400]  guy with the Judas Priest album covered on there I put up two lightning bolts in
[3:03:24.400 --> 3:03:28.000]  an eyeball and I type it in all caps Alex Jones was right and I would keep
[3:03:28.000 --> 3:03:31.920]  hammering it and sure enough there it is and that's freaking awesome and I'm
[3:03:31.920 --> 3:03:36.280]  glad I was able to help contribute to brother I believe you that's the magic
[3:03:36.280 --> 3:03:40.680]  of it and and I'm not just right we the people are always right because we love
[3:03:40.680 --> 3:03:45.720]  God where do you think this world's going brother man I started reading the Bible
[3:03:45.720 --> 3:03:51.000]  this year I'm in the lamentations of Jeremiah right now and I don't know if
[3:03:51.000 --> 3:03:55.640]  God's gonna save us one more time but if I encourage everybody to read the Bible
[3:03:55.640 --> 3:04:00.480]  to me that's our human history and it's just repetitive God gives you the great
[3:04:00.480 --> 3:04:04.520]  earth and the animals and this and that and people go against them worship fall
[3:04:04.520 --> 3:04:08.920]  out false idols do evil things and then he slams you and he's gonna test you
[3:04:08.920 --> 3:04:12.600]  with Satan just like Job everybody should be reading the book of Job you're

[3:06:34.760 --> 3:06:39.920]  start with the Easter Bunny the Easter Bunny stopped Joe Biden on Easter Sunday
[3:06:39.920 --> 3:06:46.480]  from talking he ran in front of him and said no no no shut up Joe and push Joe
[3:06:46.480 --> 3:06:50.800]  and Joe walked off into the distance mumbling to himself you know I was in
[3:06:50.800 --> 3:06:54.080]  Florida last week that's why I wasn't on last Tuesday I've been guest hosting
[3:06:54.080 --> 3:07:01.920]  every Tuesday from 12 noon to 1 p.m. West Coast time from 3 to 4 p.m. East Coast
[3:07:01.920 --> 3:07:05.480]  time I wasn't with you last Tuesday because I was in Florida giving a
[3:07:05.480 --> 3:07:09.000]  speech with President Donald Trump and sometimes when people say that it means
[3:07:09.000 --> 3:07:13.280]  there's 30 people on stage and they're one of them no it was just me and Trump
[3:07:13.280 --> 3:07:19.160]  it was a Wayne Root event in Palm Beach Florida Club 45 which is the biggest
[3:07:19.160 --> 3:07:24.320]  Donald Trump fan club world and they booked me months ago to be the speaker
[3:07:24.320 --> 3:07:29.000]  on April 11th the April speaker on April 11th and Donald Trump found out about
[3:07:29.000 --> 3:07:34.520]  it and said to the organizers Wayne Root is speaking I want to attend and they
[3:07:34.520 --> 3:07:38.720]  said well attend you'll be watching no I want to speak I want to be on the stage
[3:07:38.720 --> 3:07:44.680]  to Wayne and listen and so what Trump joined me and it was a Wayne Root
[3:07:44.680 --> 3:07:47.960]  Donald Trump event I'm sure Donald would say it was a Donald Trump Wayne Root
[3:07:47.960 --> 3:07:53.320]  event but it was Trump Root or Root Trump depending on your perspective but
[3:07:53.320 --> 3:07:57.640]  we were in front of thousands of people the event sold out 2,000 tickets in 20
[3:07:57.640 --> 3:08:02.120]  minutes when they found out it was Root no I'm kidding when they found out it was
[3:08:02.120 --> 3:08:05.840]  Trump and Root it sold out in 20 minutes all 2,000 tickets they probably
[3:08:05.840 --> 3:08:10.440]  could have sold 10 or 20,000 tickets but they only have room every month for
[3:08:10.440 --> 3:08:15.400]  2,000 people at Club 45 and so it was me and Trump with thousands of
[3:08:15.400 --> 3:08:19.680]  thousands attending and people say well what did you talk about Wayne I'm gonna
[3:08:19.680 --> 3:08:23.920]  give you a blow-by-blow of what I talked about just a second because it was my
[3:08:23.920 --> 3:08:27.640]  nationally syndicated newspaper column that came out over the weekend came out
[3:08:27.640 --> 3:08:32.080]  on Sunday and so I want to read it to you and you'll hear what I said but most
[3:08:32.080 --> 3:08:37.740]  of it was about Biden and what a total complete loser brain dead dementia
[3:08:37.740 --> 3:08:45.120]  laden weak feeble sock puppet Biden is and here was that scene with the rabbit
[3:08:45.120 --> 3:08:49.160]  and Biden and I got to tell you inside info tells me Barack Obama was inside
[3:08:49.160 --> 3:08:54.840]  that rabbit it's Barack Obama dressed as the Easter Bunny stopping Joe Biden
[3:08:54.840 --> 3:09:00.920]  from talking it's so scary everything I said about sock puppet Biden turns out
[3:09:00.920 --> 3:09:04.960]  to be exactly true they don't want to let him say a word about Afghanistan
[3:09:04.960 --> 3:09:09.920]  Pakistan or anything else he was trying to answer a question about Afghanistan
[3:09:09.920 --> 3:09:13.880]  of Pakistan and they stopped him from talking and it was either Hillary or
[3:09:13.880 --> 3:09:19.520]  Obama inside the Easter Bunny stopping it from talking or someone whose job is
[3:09:19.520 --> 3:09:25.160]  to be his up his body man as they used to say with Donald Trump his body man but
[3:09:25.160 --> 3:09:32.080]  here's a report out today Joe Biden reportedly told Barack Obama days ago
[3:09:32.080 --> 3:09:38.920]  that he Joe Biden will run again in 2024 to defeat Donald Trump can you believe
[3:09:38.920 --> 3:09:46.240]  this please God please God let it be true Joe Biden actually is gonna run
[3:09:46.240 --> 3:09:51.240]  again he doesn't know he could spell cat if I spotted him the C&A he doesn't
[3:09:51.240 --> 3:09:56.280]  know where he is he doesn't know if Jill is his mother his sister his wife the
[3:09:56.280 --> 3:10:00.720]  guy hides in the basement with a mask and a diaper being fed baby food and he
[3:10:00.720 --> 3:10:04.560]  actually thinks three years for now he's gonna be the candidate of the
[3:10:04.560 --> 3:10:09.560]  Democrat Party please God please God please God let it be true I believe the
[3:10:09.560 --> 3:10:14.120]  Democrats want to throw Joe under the bus or as a what was that famous sliced
[3:10:14.120 --> 3:10:17.920]  alone movie called throw grandpa from the train I think they want to throw
[3:10:17.920 --> 3:10:22.280]  grandpa from the plane the next time Air Force One takes off throw grandpa from
[3:10:22.280 --> 3:10:27.600]  the plane and so they they're ready to get rid of Joe and bury him with hunter
[3:10:27.600 --> 3:10:32.120]  Biden's crimes and it's very clear now based on what's come out in a laptop
[3:10:32.120 --> 3:10:38.160]  which I said in October of 2020 that Joe Biden is the most corrupt man in the
[3:10:38.160 --> 3:10:43.600]  history of the presidency and so now we know that we know the laptop is real who
[3:10:43.600 --> 3:10:46.680]  told us the New York Times the Washington Post I knew it was real in
[3:10:46.680 --> 3:10:51.520]  October of 2020 actually I had good friends who were reading the laptop who
[3:10:51.520 --> 3:10:55.440]  literally had it in their hand or at least what was on the laptop in their
[3:10:55.440 --> 3:10:59.760]  hand reviewed it and and told me how bad it was that's all he told me they said
[3:10:59.760 --> 3:11:03.600]  I can't tell you what's on it I could tell you how bad it is it's as bad as
[3:11:03.600 --> 3:11:08.440]  anything you've ever guessed about Joe Biden or any other corrupt politician
[3:11:08.440 --> 3:11:12.120]  it's horrible and it's as bad as anything you've ever guessed from what
[3:11:12.120 --> 3:11:17.600]  appears to be underage girls with with hunter Biden Joe Sut so again they
[3:11:17.600 --> 3:11:21.120]  couldn't tell me what they saw but they said it's as bad as anything you ever
[3:11:21.120 --> 3:11:27.120]  guessed or imagined on those two issues so I knew how bad it was so Democrats
[3:11:27.120 --> 3:11:30.920]  know and the media knows that Joe Biden is finished and they're trying to finish
[3:11:30.920 --> 3:11:36.480]  him off quickly they don't want him to run in 2024 because he's unelectable if
[3:11:36.480 --> 3:11:39.920]  you've seen the recent polls they're amazing for the Republican Party and
[3:11:39.920 --> 3:11:45.440]  for Donald Trump amazing a lot of people like Ron DeSantis when you see the polls
[3:11:45.440 --> 3:11:52.480]  Ron DeSantis fantastic his time will come in 2028 but in 2024 assuming he's
[3:11:52.480 --> 3:11:57.840]  healthy that's the only caveat I'd ever give Trump will be 78 years old assuming
[3:11:57.840 --> 3:12:02.440]  he looks great right now I was just with him on stage he looked fantastic he
[3:12:02.440 --> 3:12:06.040]  looked younger than he looked as president he looked healthy he looked
[3:12:06.040 --> 3:12:10.680]  tan he looked handsome he looked he looked and seemed high energy if he's
[3:12:10.680 --> 3:12:14.920]  as healthy as that three years from now he will be the Republican nominee and he
[3:12:14.920 --> 3:12:18.520]  will be the next president of the United States Ron DeSantis will not even enter
[3:12:18.520 --> 3:12:24.080]  the race against Donald Trump but DeSantis his time will come in 2028 he
[3:12:24.080 --> 3:12:28.200]  should be the president for eight years after Trump but the issue is they're
[3:12:28.200 --> 3:12:34.200]  opening the borders so fast and letting in so many millions of people that will
[3:12:34.200 --> 3:12:40.880]  we have a chance to win in 2024 or certainly 2028 and beyond the Democrat
[3:12:40.880 --> 3:12:47.160]  Party may realize that in 2024 maybe it'll be Trump but in 2028 that's six
[3:12:47.160 --> 3:12:52.760]  years from now six going on seven years from now and in 2028 and if you
[3:12:52.760 --> 3:12:58.200]  were elected 2029 there's gonna be so many illegals in this country that our
[3:12:58.200 --> 3:13:02.480]  population will have grown by tens of millions and they'll all be registered
[3:13:02.480 --> 3:13:08.520]  to vote Democrat and voting against us so that's the Democrat plan clearly other
[3:13:08.520 --> 3:13:12.120]  big news I wanted to get out right at the top of the news of course was that
[3:13:12.120 --> 3:13:18.800]  yesterday a federal judge appointed by Donald J. Trump decided that we don't
[3:13:18.800 --> 3:13:22.840]  have to wear masks on airplanes trains and buses anymore no more masks on
[3:13:22.840 --> 3:13:28.000]  public transportation and at first it sounded like they would appeal and some
[3:13:28.000 --> 3:13:31.680]  airlines would keep it until the government afield and then all the
[3:13:31.680 --> 3:13:35.000]  sudden it collapsed and Joe Biden's administration announced there's the
[3:13:35.000 --> 3:13:38.000]  wonderful judge Joe Biden's administration announced give her a hand
[3:13:38.000 --> 3:13:42.640]  she's fabulous let me let me see if I've got her name here she is wonderful
[3:13:42.640 --> 3:13:47.840]  she is a Trump appointed judge Catherine Mazzell Catherine Mazzell you are
[3:13:47.840 --> 3:13:51.840]  fantastic I love you I just got married I love Cindy Parker but if I wasn't
[3:13:51.840 --> 3:13:57.000]  already married I'd marry you judge Giselle she's great she just saved the
[3:13:57.000 --> 3:14:01.160]  whole nation I just took two trips across the country first for my honeymoon
[3:14:01.160 --> 3:14:05.760]  to Mar-a-Lago and then a week later back to Palm Beach to give this speech at the
[3:14:05.760 --> 3:14:10.360]  club 45 event with President Trump so two ways back and forth two trips back and
[3:14:10.360 --> 3:14:13.960]  forth four times there and back there and back across the entire country
[3:14:13.960 --> 3:14:18.360]  wearing a mask and she could have saved me if only she had rolled three weeks
[3:14:18.360 --> 3:14:23.280]  earlier wouldn't that have been great I hate masks I can't stand them you know
[3:14:23.280 --> 3:14:29.400]  my mom and dad died of cancer 28 days apart in 1992 I was a young man lost both
[3:14:29.400 --> 3:14:34.840]  my parents there's judge Mazzell Catherine Mazzell and I lost my parents
[3:14:34.840 --> 3:14:40.360]  the cancer 28 days apart and all I think of when I see people with masks is
[3:14:40.360 --> 3:14:44.640]  people dying of cancer it looks like a cancer ward when you walk in a room and
[3:14:44.640 --> 3:14:49.360]  everyone's got masks on it's disgusting it's unsightly I want to see people
[3:14:49.360 --> 3:14:53.840]  smiles I want to see their facial expressions kids need to see their mouths
[3:14:53.840 --> 3:14:57.880]  moving so that that's how they learn how to speak by watching other people speak
[3:14:57.880 --> 3:15:04.600]  it's disgraceful it's disgusting it's wrong and it does nothing in April late
[3:15:04.600 --> 3:15:10.040]  April early May not actually I think it was early May of 2020 there was an
[3:15:10.040 --> 3:15:15.880]  article in the New England Journal of Medicine the most distinguished credible
[3:15:15.880 --> 3:15:20.480]  medical journal in the world today and the New England Journal of Medicine had
[3:15:20.480 --> 3:15:26.700]  an article by three virologists who do a lifelong study of virus and all three
[3:15:26.700 --> 3:15:32.080]  said nobody needs a mask outside of a hospital setting and here we are two
[3:15:32.080 --> 3:15:36.520]  years later we disregarded what those experts had to say the germs of the
[3:15:36.520 --> 3:15:41.680]  virus are smaller than the openings in the mask no whatever needed a mask they
[3:15:41.680 --> 3:15:47.240]  don't work we'll be right back the Alex Jones show I'm Wayne Alleroot
[3:15:55.800 --> 3:16:00.840]  when run contact tracers aren't coming they're here all over the world from

[3:16:04.880 --> 3:16:08.200]  tracking everything you do everywhere you go then coming to your house and
[3:16:08.200 --> 3:16:13.240]  threatening in some cases actually taking people away into the night to
[3:16:13.240 --> 3:16:17.640]  their facilities and they're planning in the next year to expand their shield
[3:16:17.640 --> 3:16:21.400]  process where they come and take quote healthy people away and put them in

[3:20:21.680 --> 3:20:24.960]  book you can get it in amazon you get a farns and noble you check it out of my
[3:20:24.960 --> 3:20:31.600]  website root for america.com it's so important because I say every day on my
[3:20:31.600 --> 3:20:37.160]  radio show we've got to boycott Disney there are a hundred and sixteen companies
[3:20:37.160 --> 3:20:41.960]  that we need to boycott in this book and I give you their CEO's name their
[3:20:41.960 --> 3:20:46.200]  chairman of the board's name the phone numbers the emails the snail mail
[3:20:46.200 --> 3:20:51.480]  physical mail ads and social media and everything else you need to go after them
[3:20:51.480 --> 3:20:54.960]  and send them a letter and say we're coming after you and we're not buying your
[3:20:54.960 --> 3:20:58.520]  products anymore we're gonna put you out of business so you stop this liberal
[3:20:58.520 --> 3:21:03.800]  crap and it works works in other words yesterday in the middle of my show we
[3:21:03.800 --> 3:21:08.960]  announced that the mass mandate was gone on public transport including planes
[3:21:08.960 --> 3:21:14.600]  and we announced that Alaska Airlines said no more masks and at that moment it
[3:21:14.600 --> 3:21:19.440]  came across the newswire that United Airlines said no we're gonna keep
[3:21:19.440 --> 3:21:23.400]  mass in place for the moment we're keeping mass in place and I announced
[3:21:23.400 --> 3:21:27.160]  that on the air and minutes later in minutes late about an hour later
[3:21:27.160 --> 3:21:32.080]  United announced no more mass I believe they got thousands of phone calls in
[3:21:32.080 --> 3:21:36.480]  that hour from people say I will not fly with you anymore I will ask for my money
[3:21:36.480 --> 3:21:40.360]  back I will not fly with the tickets I bought I will not buy any new tickets it
[3:21:40.360 --> 3:21:46.640]  makes a huge difference when we go after these companies makes a huge difference
[3:21:46.640 --> 3:21:51.760]  and so I give you all the information in my book how to go after the 116 most
[3:21:51.760 --> 3:21:55.640]  wool companies in America and I wrote the book I don't know nine months ago and
[3:21:55.640 --> 3:21:58.840]  I knew that Disney would be right at the top of the list and all the
[3:21:58.840 --> 3:22:02.720]  information for Disney's in there I think we need to go after all of us one
[3:22:02.720 --> 3:22:08.640]  company Disney one and and that way we'll set an example after we bring Disney
[3:22:08.640 --> 3:22:12.760]  their knees and destroy their business which is easy to see they can't make it
[3:22:12.760 --> 3:22:16.960]  up because they're a publicly traded company and they have to issue reports
[3:22:16.960 --> 3:22:21.880]  every corner so if their business is off by 30% 40% well they will know it we
[3:22:21.880 --> 3:22:25.120]  will know it whole world we know Wall Street will know it their stock will
[3:22:25.120 --> 3:22:29.800]  plummet we can drive Disney into bankruptcy literally make them big on
[3:22:29.800 --> 3:22:35.360]  their knees to get out of politics and apologize to us so great patriot protest
[3:22:35.360 --> 3:22:41.080]  to boycott book now back to the mask I want to bring up the mask again the CDC
[3:22:41.080 --> 3:22:44.920]  announced no more masks and the reason this issue is important to me is I just
[3:22:44.920 --> 3:22:49.880]  got back from my speech with President Trump on Wednesday of last week that's
[3:22:49.880 --> 3:22:53.960]  why I missed Tuesday show Wednesday of last week and on the way there I flew
[3:22:53.960 --> 3:22:58.360]  through three airports I left from Las Vegas where I live flew to Atlanta
[3:22:58.360 --> 3:23:02.640]  changed planes flew through Palm Beach on the way back I went from Palm Beach
[3:23:02.640 --> 3:23:07.800]  to Atlanta to Vegas six different airports all of them pack and I passed
[3:23:07.800 --> 3:23:12.680]  thousands and thousands of fellow travelers and out of those thousand I
[3:23:12.680 --> 3:23:17.760]  probably you know just a guess maybe like 5,000 people at three airports I
[3:23:17.760 --> 3:23:22.440]  passed by right I was at one airport Atlanta for a four-hour layover so I
[3:23:22.440 --> 3:23:26.600]  really saw thousands and thousands of people out of those thousands and
[3:23:26.600 --> 3:23:30.760]  thousands of people only one person was not wearing a mask me I don't understand
[3:23:30.760 --> 3:23:35.640]  I assume many of those people probably far more than half were conservative
[3:23:35.640 --> 3:23:39.720]  Republicans who voted for Trump had probably planned to vote for Trump again
[3:23:39.720 --> 3:23:46.400]  in 2024 and who probably plan to vote for the GOP in 2022 but they're all like
[3:23:46.400 --> 3:23:52.120]  obedient sheep or they're like my golden doodle Bubba Bubba's obedient well
[3:23:52.120 --> 3:23:56.240]  sometimes even Bubba's not that obedient sometimes obedient sometimes doesn't
[3:23:56.240 --> 3:24:02.280]  listen why are people being such sheep I walked through all those airports the
[3:24:02.280 --> 3:24:06.640]  minute I get through security I rip my mask off the minute I get off the plane
[3:24:06.640 --> 3:24:13.520]  I rip my mask off and I walked through entire airports without a mask first the
[3:24:13.520 --> 3:24:17.920]  first point not one person said a word to me not as I passed security guards I
[3:24:17.920 --> 3:24:22.280]  passed airport security I passed police I passed airport personnel I passed flight
[3:24:22.280 --> 3:24:27.720]  attendants I went through restaurants in the airport I went through stores where
[3:24:27.720 --> 3:24:32.840]  they sell newspapers in the airport not one person said a word to me all the
[3:24:32.840 --> 3:24:36.560]  rest you could have walked around that mass if we all risked our man ripped our
[3:24:36.560 --> 3:24:42.560]  mask off then there'd be no masks anymore they could not police it if
[3:24:42.560 --> 3:24:49.080]  everyone took their mask off and said screw you I took mine off thinking that
[3:24:49.080 --> 3:24:55.800]  it would incite encourage all the people that saw me to take it off of course
[3:24:55.800 --> 3:24:58.920]  you had to put it on at that point on the airplane they would let you board
[3:24:58.920 --> 3:25:01.920]  the airplane without it and if you take it off in the middle of flight and
[3:25:01.920 --> 3:25:06.080]  refuse to put it on when the students ask you well the flight attendants you I
[3:25:06.080 --> 3:25:09.640]  know they don't like to call students anymore when the flight attendants you
[3:25:09.640 --> 3:25:14.920]  if you refuse to put it on you are banned for life from that airline and
[3:25:14.920 --> 3:25:18.320]  sometimes they share that information you can be banned from airlines for life
[3:25:18.320 --> 3:25:22.600]  and someone like me has to fly for a living I do lots of business and lots of
[3:25:22.600 --> 3:25:25.880]  different cities I give speeches in different cities ago booked or in
[3:25:25.880 --> 3:25:29.520]  different cities I do business meetings in different cities so I don't want to
[3:25:29.520 --> 3:25:33.600]  be banned for life so I wear my mask onto the airplane although I take it down as
[3:25:33.600 --> 3:25:37.680]  often as I can I keep water or food in my hand for the whole trip and I try to
[3:25:37.680 --> 3:25:41.920]  keep it off as much as I can but sometimes students has come up and go
[3:25:41.920 --> 3:25:46.560]  excuse me you've got to put it on now and I go okay because I'm not gonna be
[3:25:46.560 --> 3:25:50.680]  banned for life but the minute I get off the plane there's the dirty little
[3:25:50.680 --> 3:25:55.560]  secret is there's nobody at the airport to stop you from take your mask off you
[3:25:55.560 --> 3:25:59.080]  could walk around all you want at the airport without a mask and it doesn't
[3:25:59.080 --> 3:26:03.480]  matter and I try to inspire all the people around me to get the hint and
[3:26:03.480 --> 3:26:07.480]  nobody took their mask off in three airports on the way there and three
[3:26:07.480 --> 3:26:12.920]  airports on the way back there's sheep we are a nation of sheep do you realize
[3:26:12.920 --> 3:26:15.880]  we're in the fight of our lives there's a civil war whether you realize it or not
[3:26:15.880 --> 3:26:20.000]  we're in a second American civil war we're in a second American revolution and
[3:26:20.000 --> 3:26:25.640]  I'm losing faith that anybody's gonna ever fight back if something as little
[3:26:25.640 --> 3:26:31.560]  as a mask and you don't you don't even know civil disobedience no just little
[3:26:31.560 --> 3:26:35.680]  attempt to needle the government give them the finger I won't do it on TV but
[3:26:35.680 --> 3:26:38.880]  just to give them the finger and tell them screw you over something as
[3:26:38.880 --> 3:26:43.240]  mighter as a mask if you won't fight back over that I've lost faith you're
[3:26:43.240 --> 3:26:47.360]  gonna fight back anything further than that and we're gonna need you to fight
[3:26:47.360 --> 3:26:51.480]  back further than that with massive civil disobedience I'm not gonna propose
[3:26:51.480 --> 3:26:55.840]  violence I'm not playing that game and getting in trouble I'm gonna tell you we
[3:26:55.840 --> 3:27:02.720]  need massive civil disobedience like Dr. Martin Martin Luther King now when I
[3:27:02.720 --> 3:27:07.080]  get back I'm gonna read you in the next segment my column that came out this
[3:27:07.080 --> 3:27:12.960]  weekend the plan to destroy America was built around electing a brain dead sock
[3:27:12.960 --> 3:27:18.040]  puppet hiding in the basement with a mask and diapers and now everybody knows
[3:27:18.040 --> 3:27:23.400]  it the cats out of the bed and I wrote this last Thursday before I ever knew
[3:27:23.400 --> 3:27:27.680]  that Joe Biden was being ordered around by the Easter Bunny do you see the look
[3:27:27.680 --> 3:27:31.440]  on his face I don't know if I could replicate it on TV it was like Afghanistan
[3:27:31.440 --> 3:27:37.160]  and Pakistan here's what I have to say the Easter Bunny came up and then his
[3:27:37.160 --> 3:27:41.280]  mouth was open like an old man with dementia and then he he just walked away
[3:27:41.280 --> 3:27:45.080]  like an old man with dementia with a blank look on his face it's so scary
[3:27:45.080 --> 3:27:50.160]  look at him look at me looks like a 98 year old man about to cry look at me he's
[3:27:50.160 --> 3:27:54.080]  a confused old man who has no idea where he is he didn't know which way to go
[3:27:54.080 --> 3:27:57.600]  till Easter Bunny said in the other direction it's the most scary thing I've
[3:27:57.600 --> 3:28:02.360]  ever seen so I'll read you that we get back I think you'll enjoy it but now no
[3:28:02.360 --> 3:28:07.080]  more masks at airplanes that great glory hallelujah and we got another win
[3:28:07.080 --> 3:28:11.400]  yesterday in Wisconsin the Wisconsin Supreme Court knocked the redistricting
[3:28:11.400 --> 3:28:17.640]  map out of the governor liberal Democrat governor i.e. communist Tony Evers his
[3:28:17.640 --> 3:28:22.160]  redistricting made the entire state a Democrat state now there's no time to
[3:28:22.160 --> 3:28:26.160]  make any changes compromise or negotiation before the election so the
[3:28:26.160 --> 3:28:31.720]  Republican Senate's map is good and that one is in favor of Republicans so we're
[3:28:31.720 --> 3:28:36.840]  gonna have such a great midterm assuming it's not rigged assuming Democrats
[3:28:36.840 --> 3:28:42.720]  don't stop the election with World War three or a nuclear EMP attack assuming
[3:28:42.720 --> 3:28:47.360]  they don't rig the election with 100 percent mail-in ballots because COVID's
[3:28:47.360 --> 3:28:51.080]  back I think we're gonna have the greatest midterms in history even with
[3:28:51.080 --> 3:28:54.440]  some rigging I think the wind will be that big I'll be right back wait I'll
[3:28:54.440 --> 3:28:56.120]  read you

[3:29:10.800 --> 3:29:14.320]  but we had to build our own infrastructure because of the censorship
[3:29:14.320 --> 3:29:18.760]  and de-platforming that cost tens of millions of dollars and now with band
[3:29:18.760 --> 3:29:22.480]  dot video getting close to 10 million views a day we're a platform for
[3:29:22.480 --> 3:29:26.880]  thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their
[3:29:26.880 --> 3:29:32.840]  content free of charge and because it's become so successful it's a catch 22
[3:29:32.840 --> 3:29:38.200]  info wars and band dot video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human
[3:29:38.200 --> 3:29:42.440]  liberty movement worldwide but the expenses in bandwidth alone are
[3:29:42.440 --> 3:29:46.120]  millions of dollars a quarter hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a

[3:34:00.160 --> 3:34:05.240]  Patriot protest and boycott book and the new one will be coming out by probably
[3:34:05.240 --> 3:34:09.640]  July possibly August but probably July it'll be called a great Patriot bycott
[3:34:09.640 --> 3:34:13.880]  book this gives you the 116 companies to stop buying from and to let them know
[3:34:13.880 --> 3:34:17.680]  you're boycotting as a conservative until they stop their liberal woke nonsense
[3:34:17.680 --> 3:34:22.600]  but the next book the great Patriot bycott book will tell you the best
[3:34:22.600 --> 3:34:26.960]  hundred companies to buy from if you're a conservative and make the money help
[3:34:26.960 --> 3:34:32.880]  them make money now I told you I'd read you my column and I'm gonna it came out
[3:34:32.880 --> 3:34:38.120]  Sunday syndicated nationally by creators syndicate my syndication company for all
[3:34:38.120 --> 3:34:43.480]  my newspaper columns our latest poll is out Republican see Biden as being more
[3:34:43.480 --> 3:34:47.760]  harmful than Putin how do you like that so I was right
[3:34:47.760 --> 3:34:54.280]  Republicans get it Biden is more harmful to America than Putin by a mile as a
[3:34:54.280 --> 3:34:57.880]  matter of fact last I checked I'm not making excuses for Putin I'm not
[3:34:57.880 --> 3:35:03.800]  defending Putin I'm not a Putin defender or the Putin excuse-maker I don't know
[3:35:03.800 --> 3:35:07.800]  what he's doing in Ukraine it's none of my business what he's doing Ukraine but
[3:35:07.800 --> 3:35:12.040]  he is causing a lot of problems for the world he is hurting our supply chain he
[3:35:12.040 --> 3:35:16.760]  is killing our gas prices to some extent it was mostly Biden's problem the first
[3:35:16.760 --> 3:35:21.120]  place but some problems are coming from what's happening in Ukraine and he's
[3:35:21.120 --> 3:35:24.840]  disturbing the world order I get that I don't like what Putin's doing I'm not on
[3:35:24.840 --> 3:35:30.720]  his side but guess what he hasn't done anything to me or America so I think it's
[3:35:30.720 --> 3:35:34.400]  kind of interesting that we're willing to go after the oligarchs who are the
[3:35:34.400 --> 3:35:37.960]  Russian billionaires think about Americans oligarchs in America who are
[3:35:37.960 --> 3:35:43.640]  the richest guys Bill Gates I think you could actually make an argument that you
[3:35:43.640 --> 3:35:47.560]  know Charles Schwab and not you know Charles Schwab is in Charles Schwab the
[3:35:47.560 --> 3:35:52.960]  stock Wall Street guy who are the biggest millionaires in America Bloomberg Elon
[3:35:52.960 --> 3:35:58.440]  Musk is the list of ton of the richest guys in America and all of them can you
[3:35:58.440 --> 3:36:02.760]  imagine if we started a war like we did in Iraq or Afghanistan and the world
[3:36:02.760 --> 3:36:07.940]  took away their property without a trial it's not them it's Elon Musk isn't a
[3:36:07.940 --> 3:36:12.680]  tacky Iraq George W. Bush was attacking Iraq and he believed he had a good reason
[3:36:12.680 --> 3:36:17.440]  to do it Elon Musk wasn't responsible Bloomberg was responsible Warren Buffett
[3:36:17.440 --> 3:36:21.280]  wasn't responsible Bill Gates wasn't responsible those are the richest men in
[3:36:21.280 --> 3:36:26.080]  the United States they're not responsible yet if the world ruled at the
[3:36:26.080 --> 3:36:30.200]  Hague that these were war crimes by America and the richest men in America
[3:36:30.200 --> 3:36:34.280]  responsible and they tried to take the yachts the mansions and the assets and
[3:36:34.280 --> 3:36:37.720]  the bank accounts all over the world from the richest men of women in America
[3:36:37.720 --> 3:36:43.840]  would that be fair why is America taking the yachts the mansions and the bank
[3:36:43.840 --> 3:36:47.320]  accounts and any assets they could find from the richest billionaires of Russia
[3:36:47.320 --> 3:36:52.320]  they've got nothing to do with the war nothing so all I could my takeaway from
[3:36:52.320 --> 3:36:57.720]  all this is if it's that easy to go after the assets without a trial without
[3:36:57.720 --> 3:37:01.920]  even proving why you're doing it for the United States then the United States of
[3:37:01.920 --> 3:37:06.440]  America and the DOJ should be going after George Soros that's who you want to
[3:37:06.440 --> 3:37:11.160]  take the assets from the biggest trader and again this is an opinion show and
[3:37:11.160 --> 3:37:16.600]  it's my opinion he's a very public figure and I have an opinion George Soros
[3:37:16.600 --> 3:37:22.440]  is the biggest rat-fink Benedict Arnold trader in the history of America he's
[3:37:22.440 --> 3:37:28.000]  dirty in my opinion he's an enemy of America in my opinion he's responsible
[3:37:28.000 --> 3:37:32.160]  there's George Soros responsible for all the bad things happening in America
[3:37:32.160 --> 3:37:37.120]  he's given the orders in my opinion to Obama who's the real president not Joe
[3:37:37.120 --> 3:37:42.680]  Biden he's given the orders George Soros and he's ordering the destruction of the
[3:37:42.680 --> 3:37:46.400]  United States of America and the destruction of capitalism he's been
[3:37:46.400 --> 3:37:49.760]  trying to do it for years and it's finally working out because he has a
[3:37:49.760 --> 3:37:54.000]  brain-dead sock puppet that's willing to take the orders and sign any order he
[3:37:54.000 --> 3:37:59.640]  gives and so that's where we're at why not take a trader like George Soros
[3:37:59.640 --> 3:38:05.160]  who's open the open borders all because of his organizations in my opinion he's
[3:38:05.160 --> 3:38:09.320]  funding all the groups that are pushing people to the border and giving them
[3:38:09.320 --> 3:38:14.640]  tons of money once they're in the United States let's grab his let's grab his
[3:38:14.640 --> 3:38:19.680]  stuff all right here's my column the plan to destroy America was built around
[3:38:19.680 --> 3:38:23.320]  electing a brain-dead sock puppet hiding in the basement with masks and
[3:38:23.320 --> 3:38:27.480]  diapers and now everyone knows it I'm just back from Florida where the great
[3:38:27.480 --> 3:38:32.560]  honor speaking at Club 45 an event with two speakers myself and President
[3:38:32.560 --> 3:38:36.000]  Donald J Trump thousands of tickets sold out in 20 minutes we had a wild
[3:38:36.000 --> 3:38:41.080]  raucous standing were only crowd inside the ballroom of the Palm Beach Airport
[3:38:41.080 --> 3:38:45.280]  Hilton and the main theme of the back-to-back speeches of President Trump
[3:38:45.280 --> 3:38:51.400]  and yours truly Wayne Allyn Root was a the rigged stolen 2020 election and B the
[3:38:51.400 --> 3:38:55.600]  purposeful destruction of America that's being carried out by Joe Biden the
[3:38:55.600 --> 3:38:59.640]  illegitimate president of the United States and his radical communist
[3:38:59.640 --> 3:39:04.960]  anti-American handlers I pulled no punches I described Joe Biden here's my
[3:39:04.960 --> 3:39:10.480]  quote to the crowd as an old weak feeble brain-dead sock puppet with
[3:39:10.480 --> 3:39:15.480]  dementia hiding in the basement with a mask and diapers and as a bonus he's
[3:39:15.480 --> 3:39:19.920]  also the most corrupt politician in the history of America and owned lock stock
[3:39:19.920 --> 3:39:25.920]  and barrel by China and the Chinese Communist Party I described the Democrat
[3:39:25.920 --> 3:39:33.880]  Party as quote a party of evil radical fascist racist godless America haters
[3:39:33.880 --> 3:39:38.240]  who can't figure out which bathroom to use and who believe people are like
[3:39:38.240 --> 3:39:45.320]  frogs who can change their sex from male to female on an hourly basis I told the
[3:39:45.320 --> 3:39:50.280]  crowd and here's a quote we are in a war between good and evil this is a battle
[3:39:50.280 --> 3:39:57.120]  of normal all-american patriots who love our country versus confused bizarre
[3:39:57.120 --> 3:40:04.000]  mentally ill weirdos who are drunk with power and want to enslave us ban us
[3:40:04.000 --> 3:40:11.000]  censor us brainwash us ruin our careers and destroy our country I also
[3:40:11.000 --> 3:40:16.120]  identified who's really running our country this is the third term of Barak
[3:40:16.120 --> 3:40:23.800]  Obama Obama is the ventriloquist with his hand up Biden's back and making
[3:40:23.800 --> 3:40:29.760]  Biden's mouth move Obama is carrying out the plan to destroy America with record
[3:40:29.760 --> 3:40:36.160]  speed but Obama is just an order taker the order givers are evil billionaire
[3:40:36.160 --> 3:40:42.040]  communists and globalist George Soros and Klaus Schwab combined with the Chinese
[3:40:42.040 --> 3:40:46.000]  Communist Party that's why I believe in charge of America now in charge of the
[3:40:46.000 --> 3:40:51.240]  White House in charge of Biden that's who really runs America right now and
[3:40:51.240 --> 3:40:57.240]  every day with every new action they make America weaker and China stronger I
[3:40:57.240 --> 3:41:02.840]  identified the actual plan they're carrying out to destroy America it's
[3:41:02.840 --> 3:41:08.680]  called Cloward Piven I learned it as a student at Columbia University class of
[3:41:08.680 --> 3:41:14.800]  1983 Cloward and Piven were a husband and wife professor team at Columbia
[3:41:14.800 --> 3:41:19.680]  University and my classmates back then all bragged about being Marxists
[3:41:19.680 --> 3:41:25.560]  communists socialists and globalists see how nothing ever changes they all had
[3:41:25.560 --> 3:41:31.560]  an intense hatred for America American exceptionalism capitalism white people
[3:41:31.560 --> 3:41:36.440]  and most of all conservatives and let me throw in Judeo-Christian values they
[3:41:36.440 --> 3:41:40.920]  had a hatred for people who went to church or synagogue they bragged about
[3:41:40.920 --> 3:41:46.200]  their goal to destroy America with Cloward Piven by overwhelming the system
[3:41:46.200 --> 3:41:53.040]  with welfare debt thereby causing a collapse of the U.S. economy and my
[3:41:53.040 --> 3:41:58.840]  most prominent classmate back then was Barack Hussein Obama that's right I
[3:41:58.840 --> 3:42:05.360]  attended college same class Barack Hussein Obama class of 83 Columbia
[3:42:05.360 --> 3:42:09.680]  University now we're going out to a quick break when I get back I'm gonna
[3:42:09.680 --> 3:42:13.200]  finish this column and then I'm gonna spend the rest of the show something I
[3:42:13.200 --> 3:42:18.120]  promised like six weeks ago when I was guest hosting the Alex Jones show I'm
[3:42:18.120 --> 3:42:21.520]  gonna spend the rest of the show talking about Cloward Piven and how it's been
[3:42:21.520 --> 3:42:27.160]  updated for today I'll finish first the column nationally syndicated that I
[3:42:27.160 --> 3:42:31.920]  wrote that is called the plan to destroy America was built around electing a
[3:42:31.920 --> 3:42:36.520]  brain-dead sock puppet hiding in the basement with masks and diapers and now
[3:42:36.520 --> 3:42:42.480]  everyone knows it and then I'll go into my vision of what's happening exactly how

[3:47:45.760 --> 3:47:49.560]  this moment I'm just watching on alex jones thought it would probably be my
[3:47:49.560 --> 3:47:53.360]  only chance to ever convey my appreciation as a citizen of the
[3:47:53.360 --> 3:47:57.600]  united kingdom that you probably don't realize how far reaching your broadcasts

[3:48:20.440 --> 3:48:24.760]  you Carl what a nice email to get a surprise from a total stranger that
[3:48:24.760 --> 3:48:29.720]  shows you the reach not of Wayne Roots voice but of the Alex Jones platform
[3:48:29.720 --> 3:48:33.720]  thank you Alex Jones for giving me the shot to be on such a wonderfully large
[3:48:33.720 --> 3:48:38.040]  platform that reaches people all over the world thank you Carl for writing in
[3:48:38.040 --> 3:48:43.720]  this now I listened to my board up and producer in this year see this earpiece
[3:48:43.720 --> 3:48:48.040]  I've got right here I'm listening in that year but the earpiece is starting to
[3:48:48.040 --> 3:48:52.320]  break it's 15 years old so I went to a hearing aid center to get a new earpiece
[3:48:52.320 --> 3:48:56.440]  and I just want to let you know what the woman who runs the hearing aid center
[3:48:56.440 --> 3:49:00.520]  who's an expert on hearing I guess you call her audiologist I believe is the
[3:49:00.520 --> 3:49:04.440]  term use she's an expert that's all she does hearing all day long she's like an
[3:49:04.440 --> 3:49:08.800]  ophthalmologist for the eyes she's an audiologist you're not quite an MD but
[3:49:08.800 --> 3:49:14.640]  you are an expert on hearing and the ear she said that literally she is seeing
[3:49:14.640 --> 3:49:21.320]  dozens of people a week who got injected by the COVID vaccine and then went
[3:49:21.320 --> 3:49:27.320]  deaf either completely deaf or 90% deaf they're down to the last five or ten
[3:49:27.320 --> 3:49:31.680]  percent of their hearing I'm someone who's told the world about how bad and
[3:49:31.680 --> 3:49:36.600]  dangerous and deadly the COVID vaccines are when it comes to heart attacks and
[3:49:36.600 --> 3:49:42.200]  strokes and blood clots and massive increase in cancer all over the United
[3:49:42.200 --> 3:49:46.080]  States all over the world and and how about the biggest one autoimmune disease
[3:49:46.080 --> 3:49:54.160]  and shingles and herpes and just death these vaccines are killers but I didn't
[3:49:54.160 --> 3:49:57.840]  know there were many other side effects including losing your hearing after
[3:49:57.840 --> 3:50:00.880]  getting vaccinated can you imagine remember when Rush Limbaugh lost his
[3:50:00.880 --> 3:50:06.240]  hearing how do you host a radio show if you've lost your hearing you can't hear
[3:50:06.240 --> 3:50:10.080]  yourself you can't hear callers you can't hear your board on your entire

[3:50:27.200 --> 3:50:31.240]  that there's a new COVID summit and Biden's trying to figure out ways to get
[3:50:31.240 --> 3:50:36.440]  everyone vaccinated all over the country and all over the world folks anyone who
[3:50:36.440 --> 3:50:39.800]  was unvaccinated at this moment will never be vaccinated we've made the
[3:50:39.800 --> 3:50:44.680]  decision that the vaccine is dangerous and deadly we're awake we swallowed the
[3:50:44.680 --> 3:50:50.520]  red pill and we will never ever ever get the vaccine hey Joe Biden we will never
[3:50:50.520 --> 3:50:58.680]  get the vaccine over our cold dead hands you'll give us the vaccine got it I'm
[3:50:58.680 --> 3:51:02.040]  gonna finish my column that was syndicated this weekend the plan to
[3:51:02.040 --> 3:51:06.560]  destroy America was built around electing a brain dead sock puppet hiding
[3:51:06.560 --> 3:51:10.520]  in the basement with mask and diapers and now everyone knows it so my
[3:51:10.520 --> 3:51:14.440]  classmates at Columbia University all bragged about being Marxist communists
[3:51:14.440 --> 3:51:18.920]  socialists and globalists they all had an intense hatred for America American
[3:51:18.920 --> 3:51:24.080]  exceptionalism capitalism white people Judeo-Christian values and perhaps most
[3:51:24.080 --> 3:51:29.000]  of all conservatives they hated conservatives they bragged about their
[3:51:29.000 --> 3:51:33.800]  goal to destroy America with clowered piven that's a husband wife professor
[3:51:33.800 --> 3:51:37.440]  team at Columbia University by overwhelming the system this was the
[3:51:37.440 --> 3:51:42.480]  clowered piven plan talk to me at Columbia you overwhelm the system with
[3:51:42.480 --> 3:51:47.840]  welfare and debt thereby causing a collapse of the US economy and my most
[3:51:47.840 --> 3:51:54.280]  prominent classmate back then was Barack Hussein Obama my classmate class of 83
[3:51:54.280 --> 3:52:00.080]  Columbia Barack Obama clowered piven is the plan being carried out today but to
[3:52:00.080 --> 3:52:04.720]  do with these radical communist traders needed to update the plan they needed to
[3:52:04.720 --> 3:52:11.760]  a have a front man who would not scare the American voting public a friendly
[3:52:11.760 --> 3:52:16.640]  smiling old white man from the DC establishment and they found him Joe
[3:52:16.640 --> 3:52:21.960]  Biden be it would be even better of that friendly smiling white man was
[3:52:21.960 --> 3:52:26.600]  suffering from dementia because they could easily manipulate this pathetic
[3:52:26.600 --> 3:52:33.000]  old man into signing and doing anything they put in front of him see then they
[3:52:33.000 --> 3:52:37.280]  needed to open the borders like never before encouraging millions of
[3:52:37.280 --> 3:52:42.400]  criminals and welfare addicts to legally come across the border to overwhelm
[3:52:42.400 --> 3:52:50.120]  the system with crime welfare and debt G as a bonus they could count on all of
[3:52:50.120 --> 3:52:56.240]  these foreigners to overwhelm the voting system to thereby outvoting American
[3:52:56.240 --> 3:53:04.240]  born citizens and E throw in a few bonuses throw in COVID lockdowns which
[3:53:04.240 --> 3:53:08.360]  bankrupt the middle class and bankrupt small business owners but of course they
[3:53:08.360 --> 3:53:13.000]  never closed any of the big box retailers like Walmart and Costco they all
[3:53:13.000 --> 3:53:18.120]  got to stay open but the germ went into small businesses only that's the kind of
[3:53:18.120 --> 3:53:23.880]  lie the kind of bull spit they tried to teach us and brainwash you with you
[3:53:23.880 --> 3:53:29.240]  can't walk in a store run by Wayne root with five employees but you could go to
[3:53:29.240 --> 3:53:35.760]  Costco with a hundred employees and 3,000 customers because the germ doesn't go
[3:53:35.760 --> 3:53:40.680]  into Costco unbelievable it's just like when you walk to the bathroom when masks
[3:53:40.680 --> 3:53:44.480]  were essential right when masks were supposedly mandatory and essential you'd
[3:53:44.480 --> 3:53:48.720]  get up from your table and you'd walk to the bathroom in a restaurant and all
[3:53:48.720 --> 3:53:52.800]  the people seating down here their heads are right here as you walk into the
[3:53:52.800 --> 3:53:57.120]  bathroom they're eating at the table with no mask on your head is up here and
[3:53:57.120 --> 3:54:03.120]  you've got a mask on as if the germ is here it's not there it's the stupidest
[3:54:03.120 --> 3:54:09.760]  crap I ever heard of my entire life but I digress so they threw in COVID
[3:54:09.760 --> 3:54:16.760]  lockdowns vaccine mandates massive inflation and communist racist transgender
[3:54:16.760 --> 3:54:21.000]  brainwashing of our young people with critical race theory and transgender
[3:54:21.000 --> 3:54:26.200]  theories what a toxic mix it's all happening in America today under
[3:54:26.200 --> 3:54:32.880]  dementia sockpocket dementia sock puppet Biden but today the plan has been rebranded
[3:54:32.880 --> 3:54:38.240]  from clowered pivots now known as the Great Reset that's the new name according
[3:54:38.240 --> 3:54:43.600]  to Klaus Schwab of the World Economic Forum and George Soros and other assorted
[3:54:43.600 --> 3:54:48.800]  communist trader scumbags have you seen the latest video of Joe Biden trying to
[3:54:48.800 --> 3:54:54.000]  shake hands with an invisible person that only he sees and then turning and
[3:54:54.000 --> 3:54:58.880]  walking nowhere in particular wandering and mumbling to himself while
[3:54:58.880 --> 3:55:05.000]  shuffling like an ancient 100 year old who needs a nurse to stand upright now
[3:55:05.000 --> 3:55:09.240]  everyone understands what I've been saying for two years they use the
[3:55:09.240 --> 3:55:14.600]  non-threatening white-haired white man named Joe Biden to convince naive
[3:55:14.600 --> 3:55:20.560]  welfare addicted low-information voters to vote for a harmless grandfather
[3:55:20.560 --> 3:55:25.680]  without realizing they were really voting for the destruction of America and
[3:55:25.680 --> 3:55:30.640]  the end of capitalism and then to make sure they won Democrats rigged the
[3:55:30.640 --> 3:55:36.320]  election in six key battleground states with fake mail-in ballots together with
[3:55:36.320 --> 3:55:41.880]  no voter ID required and no signature match they threw in fraudulent ballot
[3:55:41.880 --> 3:55:48.240]  harvesting unguarded ballot drop boxes and they made sure to remove Republican
[3:55:48.240 --> 3:55:53.880]  witnesses from the ballot counting rooms the American people are waking up
[3:55:53.880 --> 3:55:59.360]  everyone sees Biden for the dementia puppet that he is even CNN admitted
[3:55:59.360 --> 3:56:04.160]  last week that Biden's poll numbers are the lowest of any president in history
[3:56:04.160 --> 3:56:09.920]  Biden the puppet propped up as the fraudulent frontman opened the door for
[3:56:09.920 --> 3:56:16.480]  the destruction of America and now we have clowered piven aka aka the great
[3:56:16.480 --> 3:56:22.880]  reset that is what's going on in America today in the latest poll I repeat shows
[3:56:22.880 --> 3:56:27.600]  Republican seat Biden as being more harmful than Putin it's like there's
[3:56:27.600 --> 3:56:34.400]  mass psychosis mass brainwashing and the average American believes what they say

[3:56:39.720 --> 3:56:45.200]  and vaccine mandates all lies what they say about masks all lies what they say

[3:56:54.480 --> 3:56:58.200]  president maybe he's not great but he's not completely brain dead but
[3:56:58.200 --> 3:57:02.600]  Republicans know he's more dangerous than Joe Biden excuse me then the
[3:57:02.600 --> 3:57:07.160]  then the Vladimir Putin Biden is more dangerous than Vladimir Putin
