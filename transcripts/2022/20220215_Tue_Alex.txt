[00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:02.210]  Emergency Tuesday broadcast.
[00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:09.714]  Russia withdraws troops from Ukraine border as NATO continues to declare full-scale war is imminent.
[00:00:10.194 --> 00:00:17.118]  Meanwhile in Canada, Trudeau has declared a national emergency in financial martial law.
[00:00:21.129 --> 00:00:26.211]  The world to the threat of the global social credit score police state.
[00:00:27.091 --> 00:00:35.894]  Also Alex Jones breaks down exclusive Intel on the Durham case and how it shows the deep state has overthrown the US government.
[00:00:37.635 --> 00:00:39.016]  And that's why these people are so arrogant.
[00:00:39.036 --> 00:00:43.057]  They believe they are invincible like all other tyrants throughout history.
[00:00:44.578 --> 00:00:47.979]  But the US background says they will not win in the end.
[00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.212]  And if history repeats itself, they're going to be going to prison.
[00:00:53.493 --> 00:00:58.437]  I just want them to stop their criminal takeover using behavioral psychology and economic warfare.
[00:00:58.717 --> 00:01:05.717]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:05.717 --> 00:01:26.717]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:01:26.717 --> 00:01:29.638]  (electronic music)
[00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:54.749]  The 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing will one day be written in the history books as they parade celebrating the point at which the United States lost its ability to perceive reality and embrace the impending doom brought on by the selling out of its most powerful assets by a self-serving treasonous elite class of baby boomer politicians and economic prostitutes.
[00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:59.033]  I would say to our athletes, you're there to compete.
[00:01:59.674 --> 00:02:05.519]  Do not risk incurring the anger of the Chinese government because they are ruthless.
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.125]  I know there is a temptation on the part of some to speak out while they are there.
[00:02:11.885 --> 00:02:13.007]  I respect that.
[00:02:13.787 --> 00:02:17.931]  But I also worry about what the Chinese government might do.
[00:02:18.792 --> 00:02:21.895]  What do you mean nobody cares?
[00:02:21.915 --> 00:02:22.435]  You really don't care?
[00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:23.474]  happening to the leakers, okay?
[00:02:23.474 --> 00:02:26.194]   You bring it up 'cause you really care, and I think that's nice that you care.
[00:02:26.194 --> 00:02:27.175]  What do you mean nobody cares?
[00:02:27.175 --> 00:02:28.474]  The rest of us don't care.
[00:02:28.474 --> 00:02:30.235]  I'm just telling you a very hard--
[00:02:30.235 --> 00:02:31.075]  You really don't care?
[00:02:31.075 --> 00:02:31.915]  I'm telling you a very--
[00:02:31.915 --> 00:02:32.735]  Wait, you're saying you personally don't care?
[00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:34.033]  I'm telling you a very hard, ugly truth, okay?
[00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:36.954]   Of all the things that I care about, yes, it is below my line.
[00:02:36.954 --> 00:02:43.075]   The irony of statements like these is that the very CCP tyranny they either ignore
[00:02:43.075 --> 00:02:50.015]   or bow down to is already in the United States, as those rightfully exercising their First Amendment
[00:02:50.015 --> 00:02:54.454]   still await the communist style circus of the january sixth committee
[00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.331]  You can't lock up a whole group of people and somehow identify them as terrorists in advance.
[00:03:00.871 --> 00:03:05.092]  A terror event on your own people to prevent terrorism, just, that doesn't make sense.
[00:03:06.206 --> 00:03:12.652]  And we won't ignore what our intelligence agency have determined to be the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today.
[00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:16.176]  White supremacy is terrorism.
[00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:22.272]  If you aren't up to speed, China's policy of mass genocide is skyrocketing.
[00:03:22.592 --> 00:03:36.195]  After killing a reported 1.2 million Tibetans, the Chinese army continued its progress towards Lhasa in a peaceful march that the Chinese news broadcast to their people.
[00:03:36.475 --> 00:03:55.740]   It was with more curiosity than animosity that the Tibetan population, isolated from the world for centuries, watched the arrival of these strange invaders These satellite images show the site where Terseny says she was held, sharing a cell with 13 other women with a bucket for a toilet.
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.361]  And she's haunted by one image.
[00:03:57.181 --> 00:04:03.501]   images show the site where Terseny says she was held, sharing a cell with 13 other women
[00:04:03.501 --> 00:04:09.421]   with a bucket for a toilet. And she's haunted by one image, masked men coming down a camp
[00:04:09.421 --> 00:04:12.620]  corridor like this one after midnight.
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.501]  They were three men.
[00:04:15.433 --> 00:04:17.396]  Not one, but three.
[00:04:18.698 --> 00:04:22.425]  They did whatever evil their mind could think of.
[00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:30.692]  And they didn't spare any part of my body, biting it to the extent that it was disgusting to look at.
[00:04:31.152 --> 00:04:45.875]  And imprisoning 5,000 Christians, including 1,000 Christian leaders, not to mention a myriad of horrific human rights abuses against the Chinese people, including forced abortion, sterilization, and organ extractions.
[00:04:46.335 --> 00:05:02.042]   For over a decade, the People's Republic of China ...has stood publicly accused of acts of cruelty and wickedness that match the cruelty and wickedness of medieval torturers and executioners.
[00:05:03.923 --> 00:05:13.288]  It's stated with certainty that in China, forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience has been practiced for a substantial period of time.
[00:05:14.212 --> 00:05:29.951]  The report underscored that there were extraordinarily short waiting times for organs to be available for transplantation, and numerous websites advertised hearts, lungs, and kidneys for sale, suggesting an on-demand industry.
[00:05:30.712 --> 00:05:56.717]  The Olympics themselves have been a historic ratings disaster, but NBC keeps on pushing their departure from compassion, common sense, and moral courage into the homes of any American gullible enough to sit transfixed by the brutal spectacle that is less than a decade away from having a hand in toppling Western civilization under the New World Order plan known as Agenda 2030.
[00:05:57.598 --> 00:05:59.598]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:05:59.598 --> 00:06:06.598]  [Music]
[00:06:06.598 --> 00:06:14.807]   After discussing with cabinet and caucus, after consultation with premiers from all provinces and
[00:06:14.807 --> 00:06:19.598]   territories, after speaking with opposition leaders,
[00:06:19.598 --> 00:06:28.598]   the federal government has invoked the Emergencies Act to supplement provincial and territorial capacity
[00:06:28.598 --> 00:06:32.598]  to address the blockades and occupations.
[00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.530]  I want to be very clear.
[00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:48.776]  The scope of these measures will be time-limited, geographically targeted, as well as reasonable and proportionate to the threats they are meant to address.
[00:06:49.716 --> 00:06:58.080]  The Emergencies Act will be used to strengthen and support law enforcement agencies at all levels across the country.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:07.786]  This is about keeping Canadians safe, protecting people's jobs, and restoring confidence in our institutions.
[00:07:09.465 --> 00:07:14.288]  Here's how the measures we're taking today will help get the situation under control.
[00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:30.719]  The police will be given more tools to restore order in places where public assemblies can constitute illegal and dangerous activities such as blockades and occupations as seen in Ottawa, the Ambassador Bridge and elsewhere.
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:37.624]  These tools include strengthening their ability to impose fines or imprisonment.
[00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:51.124]  The government will designate, secure and protect places and infrastructure that are critical to our economy and people's jobs, including border crossings and airports.
[00:07:52.325 --> 00:07:59.008]  We cannot and will not allow illegal and dangerous activities to continue.
[00:08:00.441 --> 00:08:10.006]  The Emergencies Act will also allow the government to make sure essential services are rendered, for example, in order to tow vehicles blocking roads.
[00:08:11.807 --> 00:08:27.776]  In addition, financial institutions will be authorized or directed to render essential services to help address the situation, including by regulating and prohibiting the use of property to fund or support illegal blockades.
[00:08:29.076 --> 00:08:38.089]   And finally, We'll enable the RCMP to enforce municipal bylaws and provincial offenses where required.
[00:08:39.571 --> 00:08:42.874]  This is what the Emergencies Act does.
[00:08:44.216 --> 00:08:48.821]  Let me be equally clear about what it does not do.
[00:08:49.778 --> 00:08:53.579]  We're not using the Emergencies Act to call in the military.
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:09:00.002]  We're not suspending fundamental rights or overriding the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
[00:09:00.782 --> 00:09:03.923]  We are not limiting people's freedom of speech.
[00:09:04.323 --> 00:09:07.625]  We are not limiting freedom of peaceful assembly.
[00:09:07.925 --> 00:09:13.467]  We are not preventing people from exercising their right to protest legally.
[00:09:14.927 --> 00:09:24.134]  We are reinforcing the principles, values, and institutions that keep all Canadians free.
[00:09:25.414 --> 00:09:39.414]  [Music]
[00:09:39.414 --> 00:09:51.414]   Trudeau is delivering on Klaus Schwab's stated goal to use worldwide lockdowns to trigger peasant revolts,
[00:09:51.414 --> 00:10:00.474]   which could then be used as a pretext to bring in permanent martial law through the private central banks' alliance
[00:10:00.474 --> 00:10:07.423]   with big tech to surveil and control and censor and debank and deplatform
[00:10:07.423 --> 00:10:14.414]   anyone that criticizes the ongoing martial law medical tyranny expansion.
[00:10:14.414 --> 00:10:22.414]   And that's where we are on this live Tuesday, February 15th, worldwide transmission.
[00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:38.762]  We have the ruling class, the mega banks, the most powerful billionaires and families on earth, waging war on civilization, waging war on our very biology, waging war on our very children and our families.
[00:10:42.825 --> 00:10:45.027]  We have the incredible news, stack of news right here.
[00:10:46.283 --> 00:10:47.303]  With major U.S.
[00:10:47.343 --> 00:10:56.167]  newspapers parroting the Canadian papers saying that freedom is a bad thing and that the word freedom is racist.
[00:10:58.568 --> 00:11:11.112]  Also, major Department of Education organizations are coming out and saying no one should be allowed to say Mr. or Mrs. This is a fundamental attack on the biology of humans.
[00:11:12.733 --> 00:11:15.614]  This is a biomedical takeover.
[00:11:17.312 --> 00:11:22.453]  We're going to be covering it all here today, and anyone signing on to this pretending like you're going to get ahead is a fool.
[00:11:22.513 --> 00:11:32.135]  This is a total enslavement system that is unspeakably evil, and they just hope the public goes into mass Stockholm Syndrome and submits, but that's not happening.
[00:11:32.675 --> 00:11:44.037]  So we force them to accelerate their program of control and to compact it in over just a few years instead of the next decade, and that is going to end up being explosive.
[00:11:45.532 --> 00:12:21.745]   In so many ways, and you know now that the civil emergency, the martial law, the financial martial law has been announced in the area of Canada that they're going to now trigger the violence as the pretext to use the military Physically, on the thousands and thousands of men, women, and children, peacefully, happily, cheerfully protesting the biomedical tyranny announcing ownership of their very bodies.
[00:12:25.166 --> 00:12:31.088]  Freedom Convoy organizers say they notified police that were being told nefarious elements planned to discredit the protests.
[00:12:31.128 --> 00:12:43.716]   Yes, they'll now have Antifa descend like vampire bats, dressed as the Patriots, to firebomb and Very soon there'll probably be a car bomb as well.
[00:12:44.616 --> 00:12:45.856]  It's very easy to predict this.
[00:12:45.916 --> 00:12:49.537]  I told you next they would start grabbing the bank accounts of the protesters.
[00:12:52.098 --> 00:12:57.880]  Meanwhile Trudeau, of course, loves promoting violent communist demonstrations around the world.
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.361]  We have a big stack of articles of him defending burning down US cities.
[00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:04.942]  There's that stack.
[00:13:06.164 --> 00:13:20.750]  Then there's the Durham investigation and the report of at least 25 more indictments set and the documents put in the federal filings of private security firms hacking into the White House and of course before that into Trump Tower and then of course U.S.
[00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:21.990]  intelligence agencies doing it.
[00:13:22.411 --> 00:13:26.032]  A classic bureaucratic coup over the nation.
[00:13:28.753 --> 00:13:30.314]  And then of course the biggest news.
[00:13:32.526 --> 00:13:34.788]  And I didn't just believe this this morning when I got up at 5 a.m.
[00:13:34.808 --> 00:13:40.194]  and saw that Paul Joseph Watson had written an article which was linked to the national Russian news.
[00:13:41.395 --> 00:13:47.761]  I went and looked at local Ukrainian publications and others, and indeed the Russians pulled back the vast majority of their military.
[00:13:47.801 --> 00:13:52.425]  They always have some there on their border, like any nation does.
[00:13:53.867 --> 00:13:55.929]  And they've ended their drills, which they have yearly.
[00:13:56.721 --> 00:14:01.123]  And Putin said, I told you I'm not invading, and laughed at everybody that was fear-mongering.
[00:14:01.143 --> 00:14:05.585]  NATO responded by saying, we don't want any military in your country.
[00:14:05.985 --> 00:14:11.947]  You can have no military, and you can have no border guards, and I've got the articles saying any military is not allowed.
[00:14:12.227 --> 00:14:17.369]  So having military on your own soil of any number is now bad, and it gets worse.
[00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:28.081]   The Associated Press and others came out against Zero Hedge and called for them to be shut down because they Linked to Paul Joseph Watson's article about it.
[00:14:28.341 --> 00:14:36.422]  So, you're not even supposed to say that Russia announced they pulled the troops back, which is now being confirmed by regional media.
[00:14:37.163 --> 00:14:41.103]  Okay, alright, Russia nuked the United States last night, we're all dead.
[00:14:42.084 --> 00:14:43.484]  I'm actually Casper the Friendly Gust.
[00:14:44.344 --> 00:14:47.165]  Just, I mean, it's the mind control.
[00:14:47.345 --> 00:14:56.065]   I have multiple US newspapers and Canadian papers saying, and colleges, It's time to ban the word freedom.
[00:14:56.506 --> 00:14:57.907]  If you tuned in, I'm not joking.
[00:14:58.207 --> 00:14:59.528]  They're already banning mother and father.
[00:14:59.568 --> 00:15:00.009]  Why not?
[00:15:02.531 --> 00:15:05.854]  So there you have Bloomberg wants zero head shutdown.
[00:15:05.894 --> 00:15:08.997]  And when the corporate media calls for your head to be cut, it is.
[00:15:11.159 --> 00:15:12.561]  Unbelievable.
[00:15:13.883 --> 00:15:14.904]  So much more, too.
[00:15:14.924 --> 00:15:16.545]  I mean, we're going to drill into all of this.
[00:15:17.486 --> 00:15:20.988]  We are just under global corporate criminal attack or gaslighting everyone.
[00:15:21.709 --> 00:15:23.110]  They're trying to start wars everywhere.
[00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:24.491]  They've dissolved our borders.
[00:15:24.551 --> 00:15:25.852]  They have sold us out to China.
[00:15:26.533 --> 00:15:28.094]  And they're sexualizing our children.
[00:15:28.134 --> 00:15:30.175]  My God, this is the new world order.
[00:15:31.336 --> 00:15:37.421]  And Infowars is here embattled, only hanging on because of your prayers, your word of mouth, and your financial support.
[00:15:37.841 --> 00:15:39.202]  So thank you all for keeping us on air.
[00:15:39.222 --> 00:15:39.763]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:41.776 --> 00:15:59.104]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you again so much for joining us and caring about the broadcast and caring about free speech and caring about our ability to expose this incredibly evil takeover that is happening by these corporate interests that are completely ruthless and who have now become above the law organizations.
[00:16:00.285 --> 00:16:04.767]  Now, we have the Declaration of Martial Law and Financial Martial Law in Canada.
[00:16:04.787 --> 00:16:05.427]  That's coming up.
[00:16:06.007 --> 00:16:07.368]  I'm going to host all four hours today.
[00:16:08.177 --> 00:16:15.960]  We have the massive Durham bombshells with more information and more reports of imminent indictments and what that really signifies.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:30.545]  Tulsi Gabbard said this, the Durham investigation has shown that the biggest threat to our democracy is not some foreign country, but rather the power elite led by the likes of Hillary Clinton and her co-conspirators in the mainstream media and security state who work to undermine our democracy from within.
[00:16:30.565 --> 00:16:36.427]  I'm about to talk about Hillary Clinton and her persecution of yours truly here in just a moment.
[00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:43.091]  And, of course, the huge news on Russia that I'll cover next segment in detail, where they are publicly pulling back the troops.
[00:16:43.151 --> 00:16:44.272]  It's in the Ukrainian news.
[00:16:44.292 --> 00:16:47.632]  The Ukrainian president said that they're pulling back.
[00:16:48.093 --> 00:16:50.473]  But the corporate media here says, no, it's not true.
[00:16:50.513 --> 00:16:54.114]  War is imminent because the West is planning to launch an attack on Russia.
[00:16:54.714 --> 00:16:55.154]  Two U.S.
[00:16:55.194 --> 00:16:57.475]  senators even said they may nuke Russia first.
[00:16:59.255 --> 00:17:06.648]   Deadly, dangerous, insane bravado and chutzpah That is taking place there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:07.229 --> 00:17:09.830]  So that is coming up next segment as well.
[00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:17.173]  But I first wanted to hit something that deals with free speech, not just here, but around the world.
[00:17:17.213 --> 00:17:22.976]  Because we don't just see a high-tech hack of GiveSendGo redirecting and shutting it down yesterday.
[00:17:25.437 --> 00:17:29.079]  And the high-tech hackers celebrating that they had shut down free speech.
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:45.123]   And the little guy, It was also a major leak of the thousands of people that had donated to the truckers standing up against the permanent biomedical martial law, forced injection, Nuremberg Code violating, war crime.
[00:17:47.926 --> 00:17:54.552]  And then again, I have articles I'm going to show you coming up next segment where mainstream newspapers say freedom is bad.
[00:17:55.052 --> 00:17:55.873]  Get rid of freedom.
[00:17:55.933 --> 00:17:56.714]  Actually say freedom.
[00:17:57.469 --> 00:17:59.130]  Freedom is a right-wing racist thing.
[00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:00.532]  Freedom is a white thing.
[00:18:01.072 --> 00:18:05.936]  And this is vicious central banks that own these newspapers putting out this pure poison.
[00:18:07.377 --> 00:18:10.520]  We have to recognize these people for what they are and just fully reject them.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:25.752]  And that comes home for us really close because I've learned a lot being sued by the Democratic Party law firm that bankrupted Remington and that openly, you know, is basically controlled by Senator Blumenthal and others.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:49.835]  I've learned a lot about these guys and how things work in the last four years of them suing me and having the controlled courts engage in the type of tactics that they've been engaged in to be stuck between the law firms, the corporate media, the corrupt courts in a triangulation that is a beta test they admit for all Americans.
[00:18:50.703 --> 00:18:55.404]  That don't completely submit and turn our children over to the leftist agenda.
[00:18:55.464 --> 00:18:56.785]  So this broke this morning.
[00:18:58.085 --> 00:19:03.166]  Sandy Hook families reached $73 million settlement with gun manufacturer Remington.
[00:19:04.047 --> 00:19:05.347]  Bankrupted Remington.
[00:19:06.447 --> 00:19:07.808]  Bankrupted by the lawsuits.
[00:19:08.228 --> 00:19:09.588]  Supreme Court ruling against them.
[00:19:09.608 --> 00:19:12.149]  And then it went back to the courts, the lower courts.
[00:19:12.849 --> 00:19:15.390]  And the oldest U.S.
[00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:26.989]   firearms manufacturer shut down because Adam Lanza reportedly got a gun from his mother that she had legally, that he got illegally, and went and shot children.
[00:19:27.209 --> 00:19:32.573]  And so the CNN reporter cried about that, because obviously 73 million isn't enough.
[00:19:32.613 --> 00:19:38.017]  But the issue is, this is the end of the Second Amendment, the end of gun manufacturers, if this continues.
[00:19:38.057 --> 00:19:39.318]  This is a major domino to fall.
[00:19:40.659 --> 00:19:49.726]  And now the same law firm wants my free speech, wants me to stop talking about the Second Amendment.
[00:19:50.982 --> 00:19:53.283]  Wants me to roll over to them.
[00:19:55.063 --> 00:19:55.603]  Continuing.
[00:19:55.623 --> 00:19:59.505]  You can read in the Wall Street Journal article about all of this.
[00:20:00.545 --> 00:20:01.985]  Or CNN, pick your poison.
[00:20:03.926 --> 00:20:19.116]   But the very same group has reportedly told the insurer of GCN that they'll Settle the lawsuit with me for $500 million.
[00:20:19.877 --> 00:20:20.619]  That's very funny.
[00:20:20.919 --> 00:20:21.921]  I don't have $5 million.
[00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:27.112]  But that's not really what their goal is.
[00:20:27.152 --> 00:20:27.632]  They know that.
[00:20:27.932 --> 00:20:33.697]  Their goal is to shut us down and close our doors and take us off air.
[00:20:33.897 --> 00:20:37.660]  Because that's their goal, is to take all of your sacred birthright of the First Amendment.
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:38.561]  That's what this is.
[00:20:38.781 --> 00:20:39.702]  And it's all selective.
[00:20:40.362 --> 00:20:44.605]  You notice the federal court said Sarah Palin doesn't have a right to sue.
[00:20:45.206 --> 00:20:53.853]  When they knew the jury was going to rule in her favor, when the Democrats in the New York Times knowingly put reports out that she put crosshairs over people who were then later shot when it wasn't true.
[00:20:55.123 --> 00:20:56.224]  Premeditated lying.
[00:20:57.105 --> 00:20:58.606]  That's allowed by the New York Times.
[00:20:58.866 --> 00:21:01.868]  New York Times versus Sullivan stands.
[00:21:02.228 --> 00:21:11.235]  But in the Alex Jones case, I've been told by the Republicans, high level, who don't like me in Texas, the Bush Republicans, years ago, they said, roll over now.
[00:21:11.295 --> 00:21:11.996]  It's all rigged.
[00:21:12.016 --> 00:21:13.957]  We're actually running this with the Clintons.
[00:21:13.977 --> 00:21:15.819]  I had a meeting with them right in that room right there.
[00:21:16.879 --> 00:21:19.421]  Yeah, four years ago is off record, but I'm going to name names.
[00:21:19.662 --> 00:21:20.983]  It's off record, but I'm not going to do it.
[00:21:21.003 --> 00:21:22.404]  But push comes to shove.
[00:21:22.424 --> 00:21:22.744]  Who knows?
[00:21:23.843 --> 00:21:28.485]  Right in that room, about 30, 40 feet away, they sat there and told me all this.
[00:21:29.946 --> 00:21:31.746]  And I understood what was happening there.
[00:21:31.766 --> 00:21:37.349]  I just said, I knew that I had to fight them all the way and just hope America woke up and hope we turn the tide against this takeover.
[00:21:38.569 --> 00:21:44.792]  And so that's why they put these ridiculous numbers out of, we want you to come out against the Second Amendment and we want $500 million.
[00:21:44.812 --> 00:21:45.952]  What a joke!
[00:21:46.012 --> 00:21:47.653]  How about you want all the blood out of my body?
[00:21:48.908 --> 00:21:50.770]  You're not going to get any of that, it doesn't exist.
[00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:52.432]  But that's what it's all about.
[00:21:52.632 --> 00:21:58.478]  But they did bankrupt Remington, and the Supreme Court did say, hey, no more gun manufacturers in America!
[00:22:01.821 --> 00:22:05.425]  That's what this is about, is destroying the country from within.
[00:22:06.758 --> 00:22:13.243]  And I have those enemies, the same enemies that the NRA and the Second Amendment and you have, and I'm proud to be attacked by these people.
[00:22:13.703 --> 00:22:19.307]  And I'm proud to not back down when they control the press and the courts and the system and the banks.
[00:22:20.748 --> 00:22:24.730]  Because you're going to learn very fast that you're all in the crosshairs just like Alex Jones as well.
[00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:33.035]  Anybody that's Christian, anybody that loves God, anybody that's decent, anybody that cares about law and order, anybody that cares about sovereignty, we're being conquered.
[00:22:33.456 --> 00:22:38.919]  And these people know they're conquering us, and they know they're lying, and they know they're deceiving, and they don't care.
[00:22:38.999 --> 00:22:39.539]  They love it.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.782]  They're here to break us, and absorb us, and usurp us.
[00:22:44.382 --> 00:22:45.283]  That's what they're doing.
[00:22:46.969 --> 00:22:51.091]  So remember who our enemies are, ladies and gentlemen, and remember you know a man by his enemies.
[00:22:52.252 --> 00:22:53.512]  Or you know a man by his friends.
[00:22:53.872 --> 00:23:06.278]  And our stock is rising, and humanity's waking up, and we're winning hearts and minds worldwide, and the enemy's losing, so they're taking their gloves off and putting it to the folks on the front line in a hope we'll curl up in a ball and go away.
[00:23:06.578 --> 00:23:09.420]  Well, I'm here in the words of the founder of the U.S.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:09.760]  Navy.
[00:23:11.263 --> 00:23:19.294]  John Paul Jones, when he was fighting a ship twice the size with twice the men and the ship was sinking and they held him across on their bullhorn and said, you ready to give up?
[00:23:19.775 --> 00:23:24.242]  And he said, I have only begun to fight and he took that ship and won!
[00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:31.292]  And I have only begun to fight, and you can guarantee that we are winning on every front.
[00:23:31.632 --> 00:23:32.992]  They're discrediting their courts.
[00:23:33.232 --> 00:23:34.672]  They're discrediting the corporate media.
[00:23:34.832 --> 00:23:37.033]  They're discrediting their fake agencies they've hijacked.
[00:23:37.393 --> 00:23:38.493]  They are losing.
[00:23:38.813 --> 00:23:39.954]  They are going down.
[00:23:40.174 --> 00:23:45.915]  They'll get all their fake rig garbage, and it'll be like a blue ribbon that I won the fair for liberty.
[00:23:46.195 --> 00:23:48.756]  It'll be like a crown on my head.
[00:23:50.066 --> 00:24:13.540]  That the people that want to take the police away and disarm us and put Soros DA's in while we're raped and murdered and killed see me as their enemy and see themselves as being promoted by the evil witch Hillary Clinton into this program of evil if they could just bring down the Alex Jones when all they ever did was energize me and elevate me in the eyes of the wonderful people of America and the world!
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.701]  This is incredibly good news!
[00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:33.278]  If you go to the live show headline on the vaunted Infowars.com, hated by tyrants and criminals everywhere, Emergency Tuesday Broadcast, Russia withdraws troops from Ukraine border as NATO continues to declare full-scale war is imminent.
[00:24:33.758 --> 00:24:49.766]   Meanwhile, in Canada, Trudeau has declared a national emergency and financial martial law And is awakening the world to the threat of the global social credit score police state.
[00:24:50.646 --> 00:24:58.970]  Also, Alex Jones breaks down exclusive intel on the Durham case and how it shows the deep state has overthrown the U.S.
[00:24:59.070 --> 00:24:59.471]  government.
[00:25:01.191 --> 00:25:02.592]  And that's why these people are so arrogant.
[00:25:02.612 --> 00:25:06.554]  They believe they are invincible like all other tyrants throughout history.
[00:25:08.134 --> 00:25:08.734]  But the U.S.
[00:25:08.774 --> 00:25:15.778]  background says they will not win in the end, and if history repeats itself, they're going to be going to prison.
[00:25:17.058 --> 00:25:21.981]  I just want them to stop their criminal takeover using behavioral psychology and economic warfare.
[00:25:24.002 --> 00:25:30.885]  Now, I'm going to go over the Declaration of National Emergency and Financial Martial Law.
[00:25:31.485 --> 00:25:32.806]  That's not just me saying that.
[00:25:33.866 --> 00:25:40.309]  That is major members of parliament who happen to be liberals in Trudeau's own caucus.
[00:25:41.449 --> 00:25:47.631]  And the Civil Liberties Union of Canada says this is just unprecedented North Korea type behavior.
[00:25:48.352 --> 00:25:50.392]  And of course it's going to be expanded onto everyone.
[00:25:50.632 --> 00:25:55.394]  What did I tell you was coming next is the global social credit score, is that plan.
[00:25:55.434 --> 00:25:57.135]  That's what Trudeau admits he wanted.
[00:25:57.782 --> 00:26:20.400]  So they put people in an impossible position, they stand up peacefully and say we're not taking in our bodies, your experimental deadly shot that doesn't protect us and makes us sick in many cases, and that you want to track us and control us with, no more medical privacy, and his response is to say I'm calling the military out on you and we're going to take over your bank accounts and so much more.
[00:26:21.405 --> 00:26:25.467]  So you saw Bill Maher join the right side of history last week.
[00:26:26.188 --> 00:26:31.891]  He said it on Friday, we played it on the Saturday and Sunday shows here, that Trudeau has become Hitler.
[00:26:32.192 --> 00:26:35.153]  Trudeau is being Hitler-like in his quotes.
[00:26:36.214 --> 00:26:37.295]  I want a dictatorship.
[00:26:37.715 --> 00:26:38.735]  I don't care if you have rights.
[00:26:38.755 --> 00:26:39.576]  We're going to go ahead and take them.
[00:26:39.836 --> 00:26:41.257]  You're holding unacceptable views.
[00:26:44.699 --> 00:26:47.601]  What are we going to do with all these unvaccinated people taking up space?
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.280]  That's what's going on.
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:55.321]  So here's a short compilation that we just put together this morning.
[00:26:55.622 --> 00:27:02.484]  Just a sampling of some of what he said in the past and then his draconian declaration last night.
[00:27:02.323 --> 00:27:09.323]  Here it is.
[00:27:09.323 --> 00:27:16.323]   The small fringe minority of the population, the minority of the population,
[00:27:16.323 --> 00:27:17.162]  (upbeat music)
[00:27:17.406 --> 00:27:25.518]  Of people who are on their way to Ottawa or who are holding unacceptable views that they're expressing.
[00:27:27.385 --> 00:27:45.174]  Do not represent the views of Canadians who have been there for each other, who know that following the science and stepping up to protect each other is the best way to continue to ensure our freedoms, our rights, our values as a country.
[00:27:45.414 --> 00:27:52.278]  We are not intimidated by those who hurl insults and abuse at small business workers.
[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:55.862]  and steal food from the homeless.
[00:27:56.843 --> 00:28:00.825]  We won't give in to those who fly racist flags.
[00:28:01.786 --> 00:28:08.731]  We won't cave to those who engage in vandalism or dishonor the memory of our veterans.
[00:28:09.311 --> 00:28:13.338]   So to those responsible for this behavior It needs to stop.
[00:28:13.659 --> 00:28:19.161]  The level of admiration I actually have for China.
[00:28:19.981 --> 00:28:31.586]  Because their basic dictatorship is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime and say, we need to go green as fast as we need to start investing in solar.
[00:28:31.606 --> 00:28:38.009]  I mean, there is a flexibility that I know Stephen Harper must dream about of having a dictatorship that he could do everything he wanted.
[00:28:39.329 --> 00:28:40.570]  That I find quite interesting.
[00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:54.051]  Regardless of the fact that we are attacking your fundamental rights, or limiting your fundamental rights, and the Charter says that's wrong, we're still going to go ahead and do it.
[00:28:57.469 --> 00:29:06.975]  ...has invoked the Emergencies Act to supplement provincial and territorial capacity to address the blockades and occupations.
[00:29:07.556 --> 00:29:20.705]  We are broadening the scope of Canada's anti-money laundering and terrorist financing rules so that they cover crowdfunding platforms and the payment service providers they use.
[00:29:21.705 --> 00:29:29.710]  These changes cover all forms of transactions, including digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies.
[00:29:30.646 --> 00:29:31.767]  I want to be very clear.
[00:29:32.768 --> 00:29:46.021]  The scope of these measures will be time-limited, geographically targeted, as well as reasonable and proportionate to the threats they are meant to address.
[00:29:46.962 --> 00:29:55.309]  The Emergencies Act will be used to strengthen and support law enforcement agencies at all levels across the country.
[00:29:56.250 --> 00:30:05.061]  This is about keeping Canadians safe, protecting people's jobs, and restoring confidence in our institutions.
[00:30:05.702 --> 00:30:06.242]  As of today.
[00:30:07.304 --> 00:30:17.647]  A bank or other financial service provider will be able to immediately freeze or suspend an account without a court order.
[00:30:17.988 --> 00:30:20.989]  Justin Trudeau, I mean, I thought he was kind of a cool guy.
[00:30:21.009 --> 00:30:23.549]  And I started to read what he said.
[00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:25.330]  This is a couple of weeks ago.
[00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:30.192]  He was or maybe this is September, but he was talking about people who are not vaccinated.
[00:30:31.332 --> 00:30:32.813]  He said, they don't believe in science.
[00:30:32.873 --> 00:30:35.015]  They're often misogynistic, often racist.
[00:30:35.235 --> 00:30:35.876]  No, they're not.
[00:30:35.956 --> 00:30:37.697]  That was not smart of him at all.
[00:30:37.737 --> 00:30:38.017]  Right.
[00:30:38.077 --> 00:30:40.119]  He said, but they take up space.
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:45.003]  And with that, we have to make a choice in terms of a leader as a country.
[00:30:45.423 --> 00:30:47.004]  Do we tolerate these people?
[00:30:47.104 --> 00:30:48.085]  It's like, tolerate?
[00:30:48.285 --> 00:30:49.786]  Now you do sound like him.
[00:30:51.688 --> 00:30:57.692]  All of you that signed on to Hillary and the Democrats and the Davos group, which is the Bilderberg group, you signed on to pure evil.
[00:30:59.414 --> 00:31:00.935]  And you better understand you're going down.
[00:31:02.731 --> 00:31:05.413]  You can try to take our free speech, take our guns, take our children.
[00:31:05.813 --> 00:31:08.074]  All you're doing is waking us up and getting us off the fence.
[00:31:10.375 --> 00:31:11.336]  But they're out there, folks.
[00:31:11.376 --> 00:31:12.377]  They've made their decisions.
[00:31:13.017 --> 00:31:14.418]  That they are at war with all of us.
[00:31:14.618 --> 00:31:17.700]  I'm going to come back and hit more of this in the huge Russian news, the huge Durham news.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:18.940]  I'm doing all four hours there.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:23.023]  We're going to open the phones up in the second and third hour, take a lot of calls.
[00:31:24.564 --> 00:31:29.967]  Separately, we are fighting the new world order at point-blank range.
[00:31:31.312 --> 00:31:39.320]  I am absolutely going up against the worst people at every level, and it's only been your prayers and your support that's kept us on air.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:42.963]  And so I'm telling you now, we have reached the thick of the battle.
[00:31:43.904 --> 00:31:46.667]  We have reached the heart of the war.
[00:31:47.267 --> 00:31:56.076]  We are entering the most important phase of the war against tyranny and fighting back against their unrestricted, undeclared war against us.
[00:31:56.954 --> 00:32:05.744]  And so I need capital now more than ever for what you see on the surface and for other operations we've got going on against the New World Order.
[00:32:07.085 --> 00:32:16.931]  If you want to win, and if you want these people off our children's backs, then you need to tell everybody about InfoWars.com, and NewsWars.com, and Band.Video, and share the links, and share the articles, and buy the products.
[00:32:16.951 --> 00:32:19.052]  We've extended it until Wednesday, and then that's it.
[00:32:19.392 --> 00:32:20.853]  We haven't had this deal in four years.
[00:32:21.794 --> 00:32:26.957]  25% off, super high quality, ready to ship to you, storable food for good, tasty, healthy food.
[00:32:27.017 --> 00:32:30.799]  It's the lowest price you're going to find anywhere.
[00:32:31.139 --> 00:32:34.581]  25% off, the company is taking their profit out, then we get 25%.
[00:32:36.212 --> 00:32:37.994]  The food's only marked up 100%.
[00:32:38.295 --> 00:32:39.416]  Most food's marked up three times.
[00:32:40.137 --> 00:32:41.939]  So, there's 25% profit in this.
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:51.271]  It's all being given to InfoWars because my patriot loves us, and the owner's a great Christian, and God laid it on his heart to give me the special that nobody else is getting.
[00:32:52.012 --> 00:32:54.855]  25% off until Wednesday, and that's it.
[00:32:55.968 --> 00:33:05.696]  Separately, X3, the deep-earth crystal iodine, with the two other types to help your body absorb it, so good for your entire body, your molecular system, all electrochemical activity in the body is based on iodine.
[00:33:05.716 --> 00:33:07.198]  Without it, you know what happens?
[00:33:07.718 --> 00:33:11.862]  It is 50% off, and we're going to end that sale in a week.
[00:33:12.717 --> 00:33:14.178]  Because it'll be more than half sold out.
[00:33:14.678 --> 00:33:17.920]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:22.683]  There's a bunch of other sales that end Wednesday on other great products and supplements.
[00:33:22.883 --> 00:33:24.684]  There's great t-shirts, books, films, you name it.
[00:33:25.064 --> 00:33:30.888]  All at Infowarstore.com and we will never surrender as long as you fund us.
[00:33:30.928 --> 00:33:34.230]  We will fight until the end, no matter what happens.
[00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:36.831]  Victory or death.
[00:33:37.352 --> 00:33:39.093]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:33:39.373 --> 00:33:40.994]  America is coming back from the dead.
[00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:46.473]  Well, that was an incredibly powerful three and a half minute video that Darren McBrain put together.
[00:33:46.493 --> 00:33:55.119]  And he could have made it an hour long of Trudeau making dictator comments and smacking his lips and looking like a satanic jack-o'-lantern.
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:08.067]  We had Trudeau's brother on last week, and we should probably get him back on sometime in the next few days, because this declaration of martial law and financial martial law is incredible.
[00:34:08.428 --> 00:34:14.282]   By the way, when the normal law is suspended, And private corporations are commanded and given federal power.
[00:34:14.823 --> 00:34:17.845]  That's one of the most extreme forms of martial law.
[00:34:19.527 --> 00:34:23.270]  That is the suspension of the checks and balances for the people.
[00:34:24.731 --> 00:34:27.013]  And Trudeau has declared martial law.
[00:34:28.331 --> 00:34:28.932]  Unbelievable.
[00:34:29.452 --> 00:34:42.982]  And I literally have 15, 20 clips, I mean, that are all just them foaming at the mouth at how we're going to send the military in and how we're going to take everything you've got and we're going to expand this now to anybody else protesting around the country.
[00:34:43.242 --> 00:34:45.925]  And then I've got other government ministers saying, this is good.
[00:34:46.165 --> 00:34:47.906]  We can't let people gather and talk.
[00:34:48.126 --> 00:34:50.228]  They'll hear information that's not official.
[00:34:50.628 --> 00:34:51.429]  That's a quote.
[00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:54.531]  And you're like, that sounds like Kim Jong Un.
[00:34:55.071 --> 00:34:55.412]  Yeah.
[00:34:56.533 --> 00:34:56.753]  Yeah.
[00:34:57.768 --> 00:35:01.311]  I mean, this is textbook B.S.
[00:35:03.733 --> 00:35:08.737]  And of course, there's all these fools on the left that think they're going to be protected and be part of this.
[00:35:09.458 --> 00:35:16.583]  The immoral, out-of-control, godless left has made its move against humanity, backed by the most ruthless, vicious corporations.
[00:35:17.574 --> 00:35:22.296]  Big, ruthless corporations found their minions that would take their 20 pieces of silver.
[00:35:22.316 --> 00:35:23.916]  So let me just show you some headlines here.
[00:35:24.436 --> 00:35:27.217]  And then later in the next hour, I want to get into Russia, I want to get into the Durham investigation.
[00:35:27.237 --> 00:35:31.079]  I've got exclusive information on that, by the way.
[00:35:31.099 --> 00:35:34.800]  Sometimes I just marvel at all the connections we've got.
[00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:36.360]  God put us in this place.
[00:35:37.041 --> 00:35:40.182]  I get more humble as our influence increases.
[00:35:44.352 --> 00:35:45.392]  I know more than most U.S.
[00:35:45.412 --> 00:35:45.813]  Senators.
[00:35:46.573 --> 00:36:14.342]   I'm dialed in to basically all the good guys, and it's been because I've been on there 28 years, and I've been trained by the position that God put me in, and all glory goes to God, but it is amazing, and it's very, very daunting, and I don't feel worthy, but I do need to tell the listeners that you financing, and your word of mouth, and your prayer, you betting on this operation Has changed the damn world for the better!
[00:36:14.882 --> 00:36:15.602]  In a big way!
[00:36:16.483 --> 00:36:21.204]  I mean, I'm gonna just be point-blank with you, and everybody knows this now, it's not something that's exaggerating.
[00:36:21.644 --> 00:36:27.166]  Without InfoWars, we'd be in a lot worse shape, and we have turned the tide, at least in the awakening.
[00:36:27.807 --> 00:36:35.950]  Doesn't mean we're gonna win the war in this phase, but we have turned the tide, this broadcast, all of us together, we have done it!
[00:36:38.171 --> 00:36:42.189]   And that's recognized By all the who's who's, folks.
[00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:42.590]  U.S.
[00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:43.150]  Senators.
[00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:44.630]  Joe Rogan.
[00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:46.211]  Tucker Carlson.
[00:36:46.431 --> 00:36:47.471]  And the list goes on and on.
[00:36:47.791 --> 00:36:48.952]  And so I've been persecuted.
[00:36:49.532 --> 00:36:50.452]  I've been attacked.
[00:36:51.132 --> 00:36:53.253]  You know 10% of the stuff's been done to us, folks.
[00:36:53.693 --> 00:36:54.793]  And I'm not a victim.
[00:36:55.013 --> 00:36:55.714]  I'm not whining here.
[00:36:55.754 --> 00:36:56.654]  I'm actually proud of it.
[00:36:57.074 --> 00:37:01.596]  And when stuff hurts and stuff's horrible and stuff's embarrassing and stuff's painful, I just go, well you asked for this!
[00:37:01.956 --> 00:37:04.176]  You asked God to set you up to fight evil!
[00:37:04.516 --> 00:37:05.957]  You asked for it and you got it!
[00:37:07.188 --> 00:37:08.708]  That's exactly what I intend to do.
[00:37:08.788 --> 00:37:16.910]  I'm never backing down to these people because now I would have never given up even if we were going to lose because God is testing us and we're eternal.
[00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:19.131]  And this is just a battle, not the war.
[00:37:20.151 --> 00:37:32.814]  But we, in our own lifetimes, can see beautiful people of every race, color, and creed coming together and seeing through the most vile, corrupt, oppressive, brainwashing, and satanic lies that this planet has ever seen.
[00:37:34.699 --> 00:37:40.042]  Because make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen, we are toe-to-toe with the fallen one, the old serpent, the devil.
[00:37:41.403 --> 00:37:42.283]  So look at these headlines.
[00:37:43.184 --> 00:37:43.904]  Look at these headlines.
[00:37:44.304 --> 00:37:49.347]  Freedom convoy organizers say they notify police are being told nefarious elements plan to discredit the protest.
[00:37:49.387 --> 00:37:49.727]  Exactly.
[00:37:50.067 --> 00:37:54.870]  First they declare the civil emergency, then they declare you terrorist, then they make you the terrorist.
[00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:59.472]  Here is the actual Declaration of Martial Law in English and in French.
[00:38:00.033 --> 00:38:01.053]  You should go read it for yourself.
[00:38:01.113 --> 00:38:02.174]  It's linked on InfoWars.com.
[00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:11.256]  Trudeau unleashes never-before-used Emergency Powers Act to counter protesters as US-Canada bridge reopens.
[00:38:12.236 --> 00:38:12.957]  Martial law.
[00:38:13.037 --> 00:38:21.825]  Trudeau government invokes terrorism laws, close quote, to seek bank accounts and crypto of Freedom Convoy supporters without court order.
[00:38:22.145 --> 00:38:30.392]  He is now judge, jury, and executioners, and all of his appointed leftists are free to take any action they wish against you.
[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:35.401]  Remember anybody that flew to D.C.
[00:38:35.902 --> 00:38:38.324]  of a million people trying to fly back out?
[00:38:39.665 --> 00:38:43.087]  Some drove, some flew, but hundreds of thousands that flew weren't even at the Capitol.
[00:38:43.748 --> 00:38:44.769]  Some people were just in D.C.
[00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:45.289]  on business.
[00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:48.532]  They were put on no-fly list just because they were in D.C.
[00:38:48.812 --> 00:38:56.599]   by the air companies, by the American Airlines and United Airlines.
[00:38:56.799 --> 00:38:57.179]  Airlines.
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:08.301]  That's how fascism and communism works, is all the minions attack you and then they're above the law with the George Soros DAs in control of a thousand cities and over 2,000 towns.
[00:39:08.561 --> 00:39:14.903]  Last number is 3,000 jurisdictions under their full control and full command.
[00:39:16.043 --> 00:39:16.983]  That's why they're making their move.
[00:39:17.003 --> 00:39:22.604]  They got the Justice Department, they got the CIA, they've got almost all the DAs, and baby, they're making their move.
[00:39:24.304 --> 00:39:29.507]  Canadian Civil Liberties Association condemns Trudeau for invoking national emergency over trucks.
[00:39:30.988 --> 00:39:38.812]  Trudeau's state media labels freedom a far-right concept, with links to the CBC and all of you.
[00:39:38.832 --> 00:39:44.555]  I mean, I could spend an hour on this article alone with all the links to them saying, freedom is far-right and bad.
[00:39:44.595 --> 00:39:45.215]  These are quotes.
[00:39:45.355 --> 00:39:45.835]  And racist.
[00:39:46.476 --> 00:39:47.096]  And it gets worse.
[00:39:49.337 --> 00:39:50.858]  Freedom, a slippery concept.
[00:39:51.987 --> 00:39:57.071]  George Washington University professor says freedom is a tool of the far right and needs to be curtailed.
[00:39:57.191 --> 00:39:59.373]  That's right, freedom itself is evil.
[00:39:59.693 --> 00:40:00.353]  Didn't know that?
[00:40:00.694 --> 00:40:02.115]  Oh, they're definitely the good guys.
[00:40:02.555 --> 00:40:03.736]  They say freedom's bad.
[00:40:06.118 --> 00:40:06.358]  You know.
[00:40:07.921 --> 00:40:28.426]  They got a $75 million judgment on Remington, when the guy's mom went and bought the gun totally legally, and he goes and shoots people, and then it's all gun owners' fault, and now it's all gun manufacturers' fault, and now $75 million settlement at the Supreme Court said, yeah, we can shut down your guns, you can go forward with all this crap.
[00:40:30.966 --> 00:40:32.127]  And now they want the First Amendment.
[00:40:33.647 --> 00:40:37.208]  Now the same group wants me silenced, because they want you silenced.
[00:40:39.462 --> 00:40:44.104]  But now they've halfway given up on that, so they just want to set me up for January 6th in terrorism and put me in jail.
[00:40:44.244 --> 00:40:47.525]  Because they don't want me up here running my mouth about what they're doing.
[00:40:48.806 --> 00:40:49.306]  Oh, but look.
[00:40:49.786 --> 00:40:52.927]  Why Justin Trudeau is supporting protesting farmers in India.
[00:40:53.608 --> 00:40:56.889]  India tried to restrict the farmers that didn't want to go on a national ID program.
[00:40:56.929 --> 00:40:57.549]  I agree with them.
[00:40:57.849 --> 00:41:00.030]  He supported that just so he could look good.
[00:41:01.731 --> 00:41:04.372]  But he doesn't support his own people.
[00:41:06.353 --> 00:41:11.065]   In fact, he did it under the orders of Klaus Schwab and Biden, it's now coming out.
[00:41:12.605 --> 00:41:16.868]  Trudeau's state media, though, labels freedom a far-right concept.
[00:41:16.908 --> 00:41:19.229]  Wow, that's so incredible.
[00:41:19.289 --> 00:41:20.590]  Freedom's a slippery concept.
[00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:23.991]  George Washington University professor says freedom is a tool of the far right.
[00:41:24.031 --> 00:41:28.013]  I've got other articles, Boston Globe, you name it, saying, yeah, get rid of free speech.
[00:41:29.814 --> 00:41:30.815]  Yeah, here's a nice meme.
[00:41:30.855 --> 00:41:33.596]  Here's Trudeau up there speaking, announcing martial law.
[00:41:33.656 --> 00:41:36.238]  And Xi Jinping says to Putin, bro, you seeing this?
[00:41:36.858 --> 00:41:37.959]  And they call us dictators.
[00:41:38.279 --> 00:41:38.659]  Hold up.
[00:41:39.764 --> 00:41:40.765]  Gotta catch another line.
[00:41:41.045 --> 00:41:43.966]  Bro says the dictator of North Korea.
[00:41:47.148 --> 00:41:48.169]  And then look at these quotes here.
[00:41:48.329 --> 00:41:49.350]  I've got the videos of these.
[00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:51.171]  Trudeau, Minister of Public Safety.
[00:41:51.371 --> 00:41:58.055]  We had to take the very careful and deliberate step of introducing the Emergencies Act due to the part the truckers' expressions of hate.
[00:41:59.162 --> 00:42:03.343]  Oh yeah, somebody had a sign of Trudeau, the swastika on Trudeau, saying he's a Nazi.
[00:42:03.543 --> 00:42:04.563]  You know, like Bill Maher?
[00:42:04.924 --> 00:42:09.465]  And so now we need martial law, because the Canadians are calling him Hitler, and so is Bill Maher!
[00:42:10.085 --> 00:42:13.706]  Maybe we need martial law in California, because Bill Maher said somebody's like a Nazi.
[00:42:13.726 --> 00:42:15.346]  See how it works?
[00:42:15.506 --> 00:42:18.147]  Oh, Bill Maher's a Nazi, because he called you a Nazi.
[00:42:20.205 --> 00:42:22.107]  Oh my gosh, somebody saw a swastika.
[00:42:22.307 --> 00:42:23.047]  Like the Daily Mail.
[00:42:23.408 --> 00:42:25.209]  Alex Jones wears swastika shoes.
[00:42:25.409 --> 00:42:25.649]  What?
[00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:27.651]  But see, it's so made up.
[00:42:28.011 --> 00:42:28.932]  It's so insane.
[00:42:28.952 --> 00:42:30.533]  People think, well, it's gotta be true.
[00:42:30.613 --> 00:42:32.315]  I mean, who would make that up?
[00:42:33.136 --> 00:42:38.460]  On my children may I be struck down by lightning that I've never worn swastika shoes and it's a total lie.
[00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:42.271]  It doesn't matter, it's how they're superior to you.
[00:42:42.952 --> 00:42:53.598]  It's how they take the grandchildren of World War II vets that almost died fighting Hitler and they turn you into Hitler while they give awards to people that served Hitler like George Soros because they're evil people.
[00:42:55.759 --> 00:42:57.581]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[00:42:57.661 --> 00:43:01.183]  Tech companies, banks crack down on anti-mandate convoy supporters.
[00:43:01.863 --> 00:43:15.097]   Oh yeah, first they hack into the sites, Leak, give, send, go, who the people are that gave, so now the government goes, oh look, we just have the names and the corporations without any warrants and the banks to take your money!
[00:43:15.377 --> 00:43:26.198]  No judge, no jury, they break into your computer, they commit financial crimes, the Royal Mounted Police, obviously, give the information to the banks to engage in more crime.
[00:43:26.498 --> 00:43:30.399]  That's a criminal swarm, just like with the Durham case.
[00:43:31.339 --> 00:43:34.980]  Names of Canadian truck convoy donors leaked after reporting the hack.
[00:43:36.488 --> 00:43:40.910]  When Hitler started firebombing London, the majority of Brits were against war.
[00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:43.151]  As soon as they firebombed London, the majority were for war.
[00:43:43.171 --> 00:43:43.751]  It's the same thing.
[00:43:43.991 --> 00:43:46.693]  You think linking people's names is going to make them not donate money?
[00:43:47.153 --> 00:43:49.454]  You think intimidating everybody is going to make us go away?
[00:43:49.694 --> 00:43:51.375]  No, we're not scum like you.
[00:43:51.535 --> 00:43:53.756]  We're not cowardly, bootlicking filth like you.
[00:43:53.996 --> 00:43:55.857]  That won't have the effect you want on us.
[00:43:57.279 --> 00:44:05.524]  Now I need you to energize me with money to fight these people and launch more operations because they fear us because we carry victory with us.
[00:44:05.804 --> 00:44:08.025]  The spirit of victory and overcoming!
[00:44:08.366 --> 00:44:10.507]  Infowarstar.com!
[00:44:10.327 --> 00:44:12.327]  Come go there now!
[00:44:12.327 --> 00:44:19.327]  [Music]
[00:44:19.327 --> 00:44:26.327]   Today, ladies and gentlemen, is one of the last days you've got.
[00:44:26.417 --> 00:44:29.481]  We've been able to extend it till Wednesday and then 100% it's going to end.
[00:44:29.882 --> 00:44:32.125]  And that's 25% off.
[00:44:32.345 --> 00:44:33.366]  Last night was the last day.

[00:45:23.957 --> 00:45:25.058]  Well, we got good news.
[00:45:25.238 --> 00:45:30.842]  The Russians have completed their main drills and have pulled back their main military force from their own border with Ukraine.
[00:45:31.323 --> 00:45:40.133]   We have Peter Lancaster, a big internationally known reporter, Joining us coming up in the next segment to lay out the latest on that.
[00:45:40.213 --> 00:45:43.354]  And there are crazy AP articles, Bloomberg articles, you name it.
[00:45:44.675 --> 00:45:52.618]  Demonizing Zero Hedge for amongst other things, linking to Paul Joseph Watson, linking to Russian propaganda.
[00:45:52.898 --> 00:45:57.720]  So when we report that Russia says they pulled their troops back, we're not allowed to.
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:01.781]  Just like when Cuomo said on CNN, you're not allowed to read WikiLeaks, only CNN can.
[00:46:02.702 --> 00:46:03.062]  Remember that?
[00:46:04.454 --> 00:46:05.395]  Remember how bizarre that was?
[00:46:05.415 --> 00:46:07.356]  Remember how crazy that was?
[00:46:08.638 --> 00:46:14.622]  And so now, if we just report that Russia says they pulled back, I mean, I guess if we report Kim Jong-un says the sky's blue, we're not allowed to say it.
[00:46:15.443 --> 00:46:20.708]  No, you only report corporate media that tells you we're at war with Russia and the war is imminent.
[00:46:22.149 --> 00:46:24.010]  This is so powerful, I'm going to play it one more time.
[00:46:24.571 --> 00:46:28.474]  Here's a compilation of Trudeau and all of his tyrannical announcements and behavior.
[00:46:28.935 --> 00:46:30.935]  Here it is, we'll be right back with a special guest.
[00:46:30.935 --> 00:46:38.935]  [Music]
[00:46:38.935 --> 00:46:46.935]   The small fringe minority of people who are on their way to Ottawa,
[00:46:46.935 --> 00:46:52.935]  who are holding unacceptable views that they're expressing.
[00:46:52.935 --> 00:46:55.515]  (upbeat music)
[00:46:54.583 --> 00:47:12.453]  Do not represent the views of Canadians who have been there for each other, who know that following the science and stepping up to protect each other is the best way to continue to ensure our freedoms, our rights, our values as a country.
[00:47:12.613 --> 00:47:19.477]  We are not intimidated by those who hurl insults and abuse at small business workers.
[00:47:20.481 --> 00:47:23.082]  and steal food from the homeless.
[00:47:24.063 --> 00:47:28.025]  We won't give in to those who fly racist flags.
[00:47:28.986 --> 00:47:35.929]  We won't cave to those who engage in vandalism or dishonor the memory of our veterans.
[00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:40.536]   So to those responsible for this behavior It needs to stop.
[00:47:40.777 --> 00:47:46.360]  It's a level of admiration I actually have for China.
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:58.826]  Because their basic dictatorship is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime and say, we need to go green as fast as we need to start, you know, investing in solar.
[00:47:59.206 --> 00:48:06.830]  I mean, there is a flexibility that I know Stephen Harper must dream about of having a dictatorship that he could do everything he wanted.
[00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:07.791]  That I find quite interesting.
[00:48:08.351 --> 00:48:21.210]  Regardless of the fact that we are attacking your fundamental rights, or limiting your fundamental rights, and the Charter says that's wrong, we're still going to go ahead and do it.
[00:48:24.667 --> 00:48:34.149]  Canada has invoked the Emergencies Act to supplement provincial and territorial capacity to address the blockades and occupations.
[00:48:34.749 --> 00:48:47.892]  We are broadening the scope of Canada's anti-money laundering and terrorist financing rules so that they cover crowdfunding platforms and the payment service providers they use.
[00:48:48.912 --> 00:48:56.928]  These changes cover all forms of transactions, including digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies.
[00:48:57.867 --> 00:48:58.988]  I want to be very clear.
[00:48:59.969 --> 00:49:13.220]  The scope of these measures will be time-limited, geographically targeted, as well as reasonable and proportionate to the threats they are meant to address.
[00:49:14.161 --> 00:49:22.527]  The Emergencies Act will be used to strengthen and support law enforcement agencies at all levels across the country.
[00:49:23.469 --> 00:49:32.285]  This is about keeping Canadians safe, protecting people's jobs, and restoring confidence in our institutions.
[00:49:32.906 --> 00:49:33.447]  As of today.
[00:49:34.525 --> 00:49:44.867]  A bank or other financial service provider will be able to immediately freeze or suspend an account without a court order.
[00:49:45.187 --> 00:49:48.187]  Justin Trudeau, I mean, I thought he was kind of a cool guy.
[00:49:48.207 --> 00:49:50.748]  But I started to read what he said.
[00:49:51.288 --> 00:49:52.528]  This is a couple of weeks ago.
[00:49:52.588 --> 00:49:57.429]  He was or maybe this is September, but he was talking about people who are not vaccinated.
[00:49:58.549 --> 00:50:00.030]  He said they don't believe in science.
[00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:01.710]  They're often misogynistic, often.
[00:50:02.338 --> 00:50:03.841]  Well, the globalists want a war.
[00:50:03.881 --> 00:50:05.223]  They want to be our puppet masters.
[00:50:05.243 --> 00:50:06.405]  They want to be in control.
[00:50:07.386 --> 00:50:13.516]  But Russia has pulled its troops off of its own border with Ukraine.
[00:50:13.596 --> 00:50:14.958]  It does once-a-year drills.
[00:50:15.632 --> 00:50:16.752]  And they said, these are just drills.
[00:50:16.772 --> 00:50:19.893]  You're the ones massing troops and weapons in Ukraine and NATO.
[00:50:20.233 --> 00:50:21.814]  We heard three weeks ago war was imminent.
[00:50:21.834 --> 00:50:23.034]  We heard two weeks ago, a week ago.
[00:50:23.414 --> 00:50:27.655]  Then we were told over the weekend it was going to happen on the 16th tomorrow.
[00:50:28.296 --> 00:50:30.796]  And then the president of Ukraine came out and said, that's not true.
[00:50:31.496 --> 00:50:33.437]  Please, Joe Biden, come here to America.
[00:50:34.338 --> 00:50:38.221]  Then he was sarcastic and said, OK, I guess the invasion is the 16th two days ago.
[00:50:38.641 --> 00:50:40.863]  Our media ran with that like it was serious.
[00:50:41.324 --> 00:50:45.447]  Well, now the Russians have pulled back from their already scheduled drills.
[00:50:45.567 --> 00:50:54.294]  And what is the response of the corporate media here in the West that Putin's not allowed to have any troops anywhere?
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:55.960]  In Russia.
[00:50:56.401 --> 00:50:58.161]  The Russians aren't allowed to even have a military.
[00:50:58.862 --> 00:51:04.604]  And, you know, how dare Russia put itself close to all of the West military bases?
[00:51:04.644 --> 00:51:05.004]  Literally.
[00:51:05.084 --> 00:51:07.925]  We'll believe Putin's withdrawal when we see it.
[00:51:08.305 --> 00:51:10.406]  NATO cautiously declares victory.
[00:51:11.347 --> 00:51:16.430]  Oh, it's a victory that they had a military drill and ended it, invading Ukraine.
[00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:18.751]  So, we'll believe Putin's withdrawal when we see it.
[00:51:18.811 --> 00:51:22.133]  NATO cautiously declares victory in the battle.
[00:51:22.613 --> 00:51:32.799]  Oh, to stop Russia invading Ukraine while Moscow claims it has disgraced the West hours after US intelligence warned troops were in attack positions.
[00:51:33.059 --> 00:51:37.725]   The same US intelligence that told us That Trump and Alex Jones were Russian agents?
[00:51:38.185 --> 00:51:39.046]  I can tell you I'm not.
[00:51:39.066 --> 00:51:40.227]  I can tell you Trump isn't.
[00:51:40.287 --> 00:51:40.828]  Roger Stone?
[00:51:41.048 --> 00:51:45.892]  The same ones that spied illegally on Trump's campaign and then on the White House?
[00:51:46.192 --> 00:51:46.893]  That's treason!
[00:51:47.173 --> 00:51:47.854]  That's illegal!
[00:51:48.014 --> 00:51:48.714]  That's felony!
[00:51:48.854 --> 00:51:50.916]  That's punishable by life in a supermax prison!
[00:51:51.216 --> 00:51:53.138]  Quite frankly, it's punishable by death under U.S.
[00:51:53.158 --> 00:51:53.438]  code.
[00:51:54.099 --> 00:51:58.623]  But oh my gosh, then it's Hillary on the payroll of anybody that'll give her money around the world.
[00:51:58.663 --> 00:52:00.404]  She doesn't work for the Russians or the Chinese or anybody.
[00:52:00.685 --> 00:52:02.126]  She works against America.
[00:52:03.593 --> 00:52:06.735]  So, that is just absolutely amazing.
[00:52:06.856 --> 00:52:13.721]  Peter, or Patrick, I said Peter earlier, Patrick Lancaster is our guest, and he is a U.S.
[00:52:13.741 --> 00:52:16.043]  Navy veteran, independent, crowd-funded journalist.
[00:52:16.363 --> 00:52:25.470]  Over eight years of the Ukraine war, he has made more video reports in anti-Ukraine government, Donetsk, People's Republic, controlled territory than any other Western journalist.
[00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:31.114]   He has also covered the American-Azerbaijan war, And reaching 8 million people with his reports.
[00:52:31.514 --> 00:52:33.956]  He shows what the Western media will not show you.
[00:52:34.396 --> 00:52:36.938]  You can find his reports on YouTube and other social media.
[00:52:37.259 --> 00:52:41.402]  And that's Patrick Lancaster News Today on Facebook as well.
[00:52:41.762 --> 00:52:45.625]  Patrick is only funded by his views, so please check him out today.
[00:52:45.925 --> 00:52:51.910]  So Patrick Lancaster, independent journalist in one of the eastern controlled areas by Russia.
[00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:54.171]  So much to talk about, so much to break down.
[00:52:54.391 --> 00:52:55.352]  I know it's evening over there.
[00:52:55.392 --> 00:52:56.353]  Thank you so much for coming on.
[00:52:58.135 --> 00:52:59.517]  No problem Alex, thanks for having me.
[00:53:00.358 --> 00:53:02.361]  So Patrick, where do you want to start here?
[00:53:02.941 --> 00:53:05.565]  Is it true that the Russians are pulling back or is that a lie?
[00:53:07.574 --> 00:53:30.217]  Well, this morning, Russia, the Ministry of Defense, announced that their exercises were coming to an end as planned, as they said, and released footage of their forces withdrawing from near the Ukraine border.
[00:53:31.217 --> 00:53:38.822]  They worded it as their exercises in the southwestern regions of Russia were coming to an end.
[00:53:39.442 --> 00:53:45.085]  And this is clearly they're referring to the forces near the Ukraine border.
[00:53:45.105 --> 00:53:52.344]   And as you said, the West is claiming this as something that they caused to happen, even
[00:53:52.344 --> 00:53:53.344]  though this was planned.
[00:53:53.344 --> 00:53:58.463]  Russia never said there was going to be an invasion.
[00:53:58.463 --> 00:54:03.463]  Even Ukraine denied that Russia was going to be invading.
[00:54:03.463 --> 00:54:09.784]   But the Western mainstream media and the Western powers just kept pushing this narrative to
[00:54:09.784 --> 00:54:13.264]  the people just to fit their agenda.
[00:54:13.277 --> 00:54:21.661]  The people here on the ground in Donetsk were never afraid that there was going to be a Russian invasion.
[00:54:21.681 --> 00:54:26.523]  They were more afraid there was going to be a Ukrainian invasion of this territory.
[00:54:26.923 --> 00:54:29.063]  Because that's how the people feel here.
[00:54:29.083 --> 00:54:38.165]  In 2014, the locals here in Donetsk and Northern Breakaway Area, the Lugansk People's Republic, voted to break away from Ukraine.
[00:54:38.665 --> 00:54:45.407]  And then the Ukraine war ensued, which is almost going to the 8-year mark now.
[00:54:45.887 --> 00:54:55.789]  So it's just been something that's been being pushed by the Western mainstream media that the big bad Russia was going to invade, when in reality that was never going to happen.
[00:54:57.344 --> 00:55:01.005]  Now, I've followed this, but not like you have, obviously, right in the middle of it.
[00:55:01.505 --> 00:55:15.787]  Explain to people the geographic area why this started and the fact that there's been at least, what, 14,000 people killed in those eastern areas over disputes between Ukraine and Russia in that zone that's historically been Russian.
[00:55:15.827 --> 00:55:16.707]  Is that accurate to say?
[00:55:16.727 --> 00:55:25.189]  And I've seen the blown up houses and power plants and businesses and mysterious explosions and missile attacks and both sides saying it's the other.
[00:55:27.250 --> 00:55:52.581]   Well, I've been here basically the entire eight years of this war, and this war started in 2014 after the revolution in Kiev which removed the standing president Yanukovych, which the local population here in Donbass felt was their president and when that president was
[00:55:52.581 --> 00:55:57.301]   removed they felt their Ukraine, the Ukraine they loved and was part of was dead
[00:55:57.301 --> 00:56:03.581]   and this new zombie Ukraine was put into power and I was also down in Crimea
[00:56:03.581 --> 00:56:09.411]   just after the whole events in Maidan when the Crimean referendum happened and
[00:56:09.411 --> 00:56:15.721]   the Western media was portraying that as Russia making the population
[00:56:15.721 --> 00:56:21.581]   votes to break away from Ukraine when in reality the local population of
[00:56:21.581 --> 00:56:29.090]   Crimea was happy to go back to Russia and following the when Crimea was part of
[00:56:29.090 --> 00:56:34.612]   Russia again the population here in Donetsk and Lugansk they had their own
[00:56:34.612 --> 00:56:40.181]   referendum to break away from Ukraine with the hopes that Russia was going to
[00:56:40.181 --> 00:56:47.300]   take them in to Russia as they did Crimea.
[00:56:46.145 --> 00:56:50.586]  No, that didn't quite happen as we all know, and there's been 8 years of war after this.
[00:56:50.766 --> 00:57:02.290]  But, after the referendum here in Donetsk and Lugansk, the population made borders, started creating a military, and Ukraine basically punished them for this.
[00:57:03.050 --> 00:57:11.496]  I've shown thousands of reports where Ukraine has indiscriminately shelled civilian neighborhoods, civilian homes.
[00:57:11.896 --> 00:57:18.336]   I have seen this with my own eyes, proven it over and over again, of Ukraine shelling
[00:57:18.336 --> 00:57:26.176]   civilian areas with no interest on how it affects the civilian population.
[00:57:26.176 --> 00:57:33.135]   And I've interviewed so many civilians here that just want to be part of Russia again,
[00:57:33.135 --> 00:57:35.336]  and some want to be independent.
[00:57:35.336 --> 00:57:44.776]   And today the State Duma of Russia sent a recommendation, request to the President Vladimir
[00:57:44.776 --> 00:57:53.056]   Putin to recognize the republics of Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republic as independent
[00:57:53.056 --> 00:57:54.056]  countries.
[00:57:54.056 --> 00:57:58.096]   Alright, independent journalist Patrick Lancaster, stay there, we've got to go to break in about
[00:57:58.096 --> 00:57:59.096]  a minute and a half.
[00:57:59.096 --> 00:58:01.655]   But I want to, this is all very important, I asked the question, but getting back to
[00:58:01.655 --> 00:58:02.416]  the central point.
[00:58:03.112 --> 00:58:05.193]  The Russians announced they're withdrawing their drill.
[00:58:05.273 --> 00:58:06.834]  They have those, I know, I've read every year.
[00:58:07.475 --> 00:58:15.259]  Clearly, NATO was trying to hype some type of provocation, but now Russia, by completely pulling back, it looks like maybe a little bit early in their drills.
[00:58:15.839 --> 00:58:21.262]  This has really, again, discredited the West that's been saying war is imminent for the last three weeks every day.
[00:58:22.223 --> 00:58:24.604]  Why do you think NATO was saying this and doing this?
[00:58:25.104 --> 00:58:29.647]  What is the point of discrediting themselves over and over again saying a Russian invasion is imminent?
[00:58:33.879 --> 00:58:34.246]  Well, Jay...
[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:45.187]  Almost every year, something along these lines happens where the West blames Russia for creating a possible escalation in this conflict.
[00:58:45.908 --> 00:58:58.457]  When in reality, Ukraine forces are the ones that do not follow the Minsk agreements, which is supposed to be to help the local population here and bring an end to this war.
[00:58:58.537 --> 00:59:09.063]   But on a daily basis, weekly basis, Ukraine continues to attack the civilian population And by the way, that's not debated.
[00:59:09.323 --> 00:59:13.285]  We're showing footage you shot and others have shot of just devastated areas.
[00:59:13.305 --> 00:59:30.873]  I want to come back and talk about the devastation in eastern Ukraine on the border with Russia and what this Western proxy war has done in the past and where you think they're going in the future now that Putin has done his drill in case they try to take over those Russian areas and what you think the West will do now that he's de-escalated.
[00:59:30.693 --> 00:59:41.972]  Stay with us.
[00:59:42.426 --> 00:59:45.607]  You also say you have no intention of invading Ukraine.
[00:59:46.247 --> 00:59:51.869]  So will you guarantee unconditionally that you will not invade Ukraine or any other sovereign country?
[00:59:52.269 --> 00:59:54.649]  Or does that depend on how negotiations go?
[00:59:55.690 --> 01:00:02.452]  And another question, what is it do you think that the West does not understand about Russia or about your intentions?
[01:00:02.772 --> 01:00:03.772]  Thank you.
[01:00:03.772 --> 01:00:14.652]   Speaking of the security guarantees and what it will depend upon or if something will depend
[01:00:14.652 --> 01:00:19.372]   upon the negotiations, our actions will not depend on the negotiation.
[01:00:19.514 --> 01:00:26.098]  They will depend on the unconditional compliance with the Russian security demands today and in the historical context.
[01:00:26.538 --> 01:00:32.181]  In this sense, we have made it clear that any further NATO movement to the east is unacceptable.
[01:00:33.442 --> 01:00:34.923]  There is nothing unclear about this.
[01:00:35.784 --> 01:00:40.067]  We are not deploying our missiles over at the borders of the U.S.
[01:00:40.447 --> 01:00:40.707]  No.
[01:00:41.188 --> 01:00:42.329]  On the other hand, the U.S.
[01:00:42.389 --> 01:00:47.212]  is deploying its missiles close to our home, on the porch of our house.
[01:00:48.713 --> 01:00:52.836]  So, are we demanding something excessive?
[01:00:53.176 --> 01:00:57.540]  We're simply asking them not to deploy their attack systems over at our home.
[01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:00.322]  What is so unusual or peculiar about that?
[01:01:01.536 --> 01:01:16.744]  So, what would the Americans think if we, for example, decided to come to the border between, say, Canada and the United States, or Mexico, and simply deploy our missiles over there?
[01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:21.213]  Well, did Mexico and the U.S.
[01:01:21.253 --> 01:01:22.975]  never have any territorial disputes?
[01:01:23.255 --> 01:01:24.236]  What about California?
[01:01:24.256 --> 01:01:25.117]  What about Texas?
[01:01:26.138 --> 01:01:27.320]  Did you forget about that?
[01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:29.602]  But everything seems to have calmed down.
[01:01:29.682 --> 01:01:33.846]  Nobody remembers those things just like the way they remember about Crimea.
[01:01:34.367 --> 01:01:35.588]  We try not to remember.
[01:01:40.362 --> 01:01:43.084]  The Awakening is incredible that's taking place right now.
[01:01:43.444 --> 01:01:51.249]  Patrick Lancaster is an amazing reporter that has literally shot thousands of in-the-street, in-the-field films, many of which we've aired here and watched.
[01:01:52.670 --> 01:02:02.576]  As soon as I saw this latest announcement by the Russians that they're going to end their drills, I knew the media would just say it wasn't true.
[01:02:03.196 --> 01:02:05.358]  Because that's what they do, folks, they gaslight us.
[01:02:05.378 --> 01:02:08.619]   So Patrick, Where do you see this going next?
[01:02:08.659 --> 01:02:10.181]  Because clearly Biden's in trouble.
[01:02:10.742 --> 01:02:11.743]  Everybody's waking up to him.
[01:02:11.763 --> 01:02:13.946]  He's got like a 30% or lower approval rating.
[01:02:14.567 --> 01:02:16.750]  And now their whole COVID power grab is falling apart.
[01:02:17.711 --> 01:02:18.452]  What are they going to do?
[01:02:18.492 --> 01:02:21.656]  Well, when you lose control, start a war if you're an authoritarian group.
[01:02:21.996 --> 01:02:24.720]  Justin Trudeau has declared martial law in Canada.
[01:02:26.756 --> 01:02:30.702]  Where do you see the West going now that it's run by these psychotics?
[01:02:30.742 --> 01:02:36.050]  And how do you see Russia responding when it's shown incredible restraint to five NATO expansions?
[01:02:36.070 --> 01:02:41.719]  I just played part of a Putin interview that I'm going to air all of in the last 30 minutes of the show today.
[01:02:42.998 --> 01:03:03.955]  Where it's all so reasonable and real, not because I'm a Putin follower, but because I've studied all the angles, and I know he's being very real, very straightforward with people, and then our media tell us that he's the second coming of Hitler, but then meanwhile a guy that actually worked for Hitler, George Soros, brags that he helped overthrow Ukraine eight years ago on CNN with Fareed Zakaria.
[01:03:08.709 --> 01:03:22.365]  Well, I think there is quite a few different possibilities for the near future here, and it does depend on how the Western powers and Russia will react.
[01:03:22.866 --> 01:03:37.580]   I think the next trigger might be the fact that Right now, it's on the books and in Putin's hands whether Russia is going to recognize the republics as independent states.
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.362]  And this just happened this afternoon.
[01:03:40.382 --> 01:03:50.247]  And the German chancellor, Schultz, has already stated that this is against the Minsk agreement.
[01:03:50.447 --> 01:04:14.797]   And Ukraine has also stated that if Russia recognizes the republics as independent states, that it's them Totally pulling out of Minsk at the Minsk agreements and the NATO and United States it has the possibility to use this against Russia as a provocation to intensify the conflict here.
[01:04:14.817 --> 01:04:17.478]  So we're going to have to see how the world powers react.
[01:04:17.658 --> 01:04:24.260]  But this is the newest possibility for a political escalation here.
[01:04:26.331 --> 01:04:28.132]  Wow, I could ask a hundred questions.
[01:04:28.272 --> 01:04:30.473]  I mean, you've done so much amazing work.
[01:04:30.513 --> 01:04:31.454]  I feel like I know you.
[01:04:32.555 --> 01:04:36.197]  My producer said, hey, we've got this well-known American reporter on.
[01:04:36.217 --> 01:04:36.817]  He's going to come on.
[01:04:36.837 --> 01:04:42.480]  As soon as I saw your face, then I clicked all the countless videos I've watched in eight years of the stuff you've caught on tape.
[01:04:42.761 --> 01:04:47.063]  We should have you on sometime just to send us your best clips of the incredible stuff.
[01:04:47.443 --> 01:04:48.364]  People getting blown up.
[01:04:48.999 --> 01:04:53.204]  Buildings on fire, bombs, artillery coming in, dead civilians.
[01:04:53.644 --> 01:04:57.048]  I mean, the combat footage and stuff you've gotten has just been insane.
[01:04:57.309 --> 01:05:02.795]  For Americans, and you're a Navy veteran as well, and military people in the U.S.
[01:05:02.835 --> 01:05:06.619]  who've not been over there and seen this, how serious is this and how would you describe it?
[01:05:10.615 --> 01:05:19.379]  For many people, many people in the West, they don't even realize that this war has been going on in Europe for almost eight years now.
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:24.002]  And the amount of people, as you said, over 14,000 people have been killed.
[01:05:24.022 --> 01:05:26.583]  I personally think that's probably a low number.
[01:05:26.823 --> 01:05:29.905]  But, I mean, this has been year after year.
[01:05:31.951 --> 01:05:45.537]  A war that has intensified and then it calmed and it just keeps going on this cycle for eight years now with no real end in sight because it's all controlled by the world powers.
[01:05:45.577 --> 01:05:58.283]  The people here in Donetsk and the rest of it at Donbass, I asked them every time I go and film their homes after they've been destroyed by the Ukrainian forces what they want and they just say they want peace.
[01:05:59.164 --> 01:06:02.873]  They want peace and to be no longer part of Ukraine.
[01:06:02.893 --> 01:06:07.263]  And the main thing most of them want is to become part of Russia.
[01:06:09.079 --> 01:06:09.780]  Absolutely.
[01:06:10.380 --> 01:06:13.202]  Again, I have been accused of being a Russian agent.
[01:06:13.222 --> 01:06:14.043]  I've never been to Russia.
[01:06:14.083 --> 01:06:14.683]  I'd love to go.
[01:06:14.703 --> 01:06:15.464]  I'd love to go to Israel.
[01:06:15.484 --> 01:06:16.305]  I'd love to go to Egypt.
[01:06:16.345 --> 01:06:18.066]  I'd love to go to a lot of places I haven't been.
[01:06:18.086 --> 01:06:18.906]  I'd love to go to Japan.
[01:06:19.507 --> 01:06:26.993]  But being demonized as a Russian agent made me go study Russia more and find out how Russia really is being ganged up on.
[01:06:27.493 --> 01:06:30.915]  It's the only country that isn't invited to the Bilderberg Group.
[01:06:31.917 --> 01:06:33.740]  Uh, and you can say, you know, Russia's got its problems.
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:39.329]  I'm not saying it didn't, you know, doesn't have its corruption and things, but literally the whole world is ganged up on Russia.
[01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:40.271]  You just can't deny that.
[01:06:40.571 --> 01:06:42.755]  Why do you think that's the case or do you disagree with that statement?
[01:06:47.742 --> 01:07:06.354]  Yes, the whole Western world tends to go against Russia in the East, as it can be said that the East also is on the opposite side of the Western world, which everyone realizes is the case.
[01:07:06.774 --> 01:07:20.599]   But, as the clip you showed of the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, say, how would the United States react if there They were putting missiles, like in the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[01:07:20.619 --> 01:07:29.166]  How did the United States react when Russia, if Russia would try to encroach on the United States?
[01:07:29.466 --> 01:07:31.008]  And this is what Russia is doing.
[01:07:31.068 --> 01:07:36.873]  They just don't want NATO to keep pushing and pushing over and over again.
[01:07:36.893 --> 01:07:41.057]  And let's let that sink in and we'll do one more segment and let you go wherever you want to go because I think you've got a lot to say.
[01:07:43.473 --> 01:07:49.736]  Imagine ten billion dollars in weapons, all these foreign mercenaries and troops attacking the Russian border.
[01:07:50.076 --> 01:07:54.558]  The Russians do a drill on their border and the world acts like they're raping babies or something.
[01:07:55.179 --> 01:07:58.060]  I mean this is so obvious that the West is the aggressor here.
[01:07:59.061 --> 01:07:59.701]  We'll be right back.
[01:07:59.721 --> 01:08:00.101]  Stay there.
[01:08:00.141 --> 01:08:02.642]  Patrick Lancaster is our guest.
[01:08:03.163 --> 01:08:04.943]  Patrick Lancaster news today.
[01:08:04.963 --> 01:08:09.226]  And we're going to come back and just get into how do we stop this?
[01:08:09.266 --> 01:08:10.506]  How do we stop the warmongers?
[01:08:11.046 --> 01:08:16.782]   And how do we get Peace without giving into the New World Order.
[01:08:16.802 --> 01:08:17.643]  I mean, what does Russia do?
[01:08:17.663 --> 01:08:21.166]  Just sign everything over to Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates?
[01:08:21.606 --> 01:08:34.476]  Ladies and gentlemen, I don't say this to brag because we're in very dark times around the world, but I say to let you know that even during the breaks, we are reaching tens of millions of people in ways that someday I'll write a book.
[01:08:35.247 --> 01:08:42.950]  Well, long after we win this war or lose this war, one way or another, if it's God's will, you'll learn about some of the inside baseball and the things we've done.
[01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:43.970]  But I can just tell you this.
[01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:47.951]  You cannot bet on another news organization to do more than Infowars.
[01:08:48.691 --> 01:08:51.272]  I wish other places were as effective as we are.
[01:08:51.773 --> 01:08:54.193]  And Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan have basically gotten there.
[01:08:54.593 --> 01:08:55.534]  And we're not judging them.
[01:08:55.574 --> 01:08:56.874]  We want them to go way past us.
[01:08:57.454 --> 01:09:03.243]   But even behind the scenes, You just don't know the influence of what we're doing and what we're up to.
[01:09:03.283 --> 01:09:07.228]  And that's credit to you for keeping this dog in the fight.
[01:09:07.268 --> 01:09:11.473]  This is all of us together, our combined will to carry this out.
[01:09:11.914 --> 01:09:22.161]   Patrick Lancaster is an amazing veteran independent Crowdfunded journalist who's lived for eight years in eastern Ukraine and covered the ongoing globalist proxy war.
[01:09:22.181 --> 01:09:28.684]  He's also a US Navy veteran What what got you out there to that area to Donetsk?
[01:09:28.944 --> 01:09:34.065]  What what got you to you to Ukraine and what other points would you like to make to this audience?
[01:09:37.587 --> 01:09:46.375]   What really got me interested in Pushing the facts that I see with my own eyes here is when I
[01:09:47.492 --> 01:10:01.520]  I came to Crimea during the referendum there when Crimea joined Russia because I saw what the Western media was showing and how it was totally different than what I saw with my own eyes there.
[01:10:02.321 --> 01:10:10.306]  How the people there just were just so happy, just in tears of being able to join Russia again.
[01:10:10.786 --> 01:10:20.815]   Because I mean the people that were Born before 1956 in Crimea were born in Russia and they were just so happy to go back to their home.
[01:10:21.295 --> 01:10:25.319]  And that wasn't what the Western media, mainstream media was showing.
[01:10:26.957 --> 01:10:39.300]  When everything started to calm down in Crimea, I saw the escalation that was happening in Donbass and decided to come here and try to show the world what was really happening.
[01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:42.021]  What I saw with my own eyes here.
[01:10:42.081 --> 01:10:44.741]  I don't like to put my opinions at all in my reports.
[01:10:44.801 --> 01:10:49.042]  I just show exactly what I see and what the facts are on the ground.
[01:10:49.522 --> 01:10:55.704]  Because the Western mainstream media won't show what goes against their country's narrative.
[01:10:57.561 --> 01:10:58.142]  Absolutely.
[01:10:58.162 --> 01:11:15.645]   I don't know if you saw this a week and a half ago, but the spokesperson for the State Department from the CIA was there saying that Russia was going to stage a false flag and had a fake video of atrocities by the Ukrainians against the Russians, even though there's ongoing war and people being killed.
[01:11:16.126 --> 01:11:17.406]  They were saying, no, none of that exists.
[01:11:17.426 --> 01:11:18.067]  It's all fake.
[01:11:18.087 --> 01:11:19.408]  The Russians have made a fake video.
[01:11:19.908 --> 01:11:26.553]  And the reporter for AP said, well, that's Alex Jones territory you're getting into now.
[01:11:26.593 --> 01:11:37.790]   Well, no, when I say there's false flags, which do happen, I have evidence like Jesse Smollett, WMDs in Iraq, Gulf of Tonkin, Operation Northwoods, those are all real things people can look up.
[01:11:38.431 --> 01:11:43.757]  But what do you think the West was trying to do claiming Russia is going to be involved in a false flag?
[01:11:44.217 --> 01:11:48.242]  Was NATO planning to attack Russians and when Russians attack say, oh, we didn't attack, that's fake?
[01:11:48.742 --> 01:11:51.065]  Or did they think Russia might actually stage a false flag?
[01:11:54.975 --> 01:12:08.442]  They were pushing their agenda, and as the AP reporter asked them, where is the evidence of this so-called false flag that's going to happen?
[01:12:09.545 --> 01:12:13.166]  They couldn't produce any evidence because there was no evidence.
[01:12:13.206 --> 01:12:31.610]  This was just something that was generated to, again, discredit Russia and try to further their agenda of this magical Russian invasion where the big bad Russian wolf is going to hop and puff and blow Ukraine down.
[01:12:32.290 --> 01:12:34.150]  And they just kept trying to push that.
[01:12:34.210 --> 01:12:40.061]   And it's going to be interesting to see what their next The line is to push this agenda.
[01:12:41.994 --> 01:12:52.777]  What do you think the globalists that control our puppet president here in the U.S., what do you think they're saying and doing right now that Russia has pulled back from the border and is really letting the West mass all these troops and weapons?
[01:12:53.177 --> 01:12:54.518]  So this is really a stand-down.
[01:12:54.558 --> 01:12:58.039]  I don't know if I was the Russian president if I would pull troops off the border.
[01:12:58.059 --> 01:12:59.859]  If people were massing troops on my border, I'd pull back.
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:01.180]  I get why he's doing it.
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:08.022]  It's kind of an Obi-Wan Kenobi move where he lets Darth Vader get him to show who the bad guy is or a Martin Luther King-style junior move here.
[01:13:08.542 --> 01:13:13.347]  I just hope that the West doesn't get pissed now and launch an attack on Russia as a provocation.
[01:13:13.367 --> 01:13:14.368]  What do you think is really going to happen?
[01:13:17.239 --> 01:13:25.923]  There are just so many possibilities and things are changing on not even a daily basis, just an hourly basis.
[01:13:27.364 --> 01:13:38.148]  So much also depends on, like I said, if Putin recognizes the republics as independent countries and what the West decides to do with that information.
[01:13:39.469 --> 01:13:45.892]  I can't even comment on what can happen next because everything can change by the time we're done with this show.
[01:13:46.832 --> 01:14:01.440]  What do you think of all the, I'm sure you've seen it, you're super informed, all the videos of the State Department provocatively showing billions in anti-aircraft, anti-tank missiles, javelins, you name it, being shipped in, and the celebrations and the calls for war.
[01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:04.901]  By the minority of Ukrainians, they've obviously whipped into war fury.
[01:14:04.921 --> 01:14:08.223]  I mean, as you said, you're living right in a town they've already been attacking.
[01:14:08.503 --> 01:14:16.207]  What is it like to know they don't just have smaller mortars and artillery and old-fashioned, you know, RPGs now and machine guns.
[01:14:16.547 --> 01:14:20.029]  Now they've got class-A European, British and U.S.
[01:14:20.069 --> 01:14:20.369]  weapons.
[01:14:22.394 --> 01:14:29.022]  Well, the local population here is afraid when those weapons are going to start hitting their homes.
[01:14:29.622 --> 01:14:37.391]  Because the people here see this, because as you said, Ukraine is bragging about these weapons arriving.
[01:14:37.911 --> 01:14:40.473]  And these aren't the first Western weapons arising.
[01:14:40.553 --> 01:14:52.824]  Less than two weeks ago, I did a report on a civilian electric substation which was targeted by Ukraine forces not far from where I am right now.
[01:14:53.424 --> 01:15:03.590]   And we found the evidence of 60 millimeter mortars No question about it.
[01:15:03.850 --> 01:15:13.495]  And these 60mm mortars are not in the arsenal of Ukraine, nor were in the arsenal of the Soviet Union or Russia.
[01:15:13.575 --> 01:15:17.436]  These were Western supplied 60mm mortars.
[01:15:17.757 --> 01:15:19.797]  They did not come from the East.
[01:15:19.817 --> 01:15:20.758]  They came from the West.
[01:15:21.358 --> 01:15:21.598]  Absolutely.
[01:15:21.738 --> 01:15:22.259]  It's just insane.
[01:15:22.279 --> 01:15:24.740]  There's no doubt who's pushing the borders of NATO.
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:26.461]  There's no doubt who's shipping in high-tech weapons.
[01:15:26.481 --> 01:15:30.403]  There's no doubt who's trying to start a war with Russia and it should concern us all.
[01:15:30.443 --> 01:15:32.844]  Patrick Lancaster, thank you so much.
[01:15:32.663 --> 01:15:37.302]   The people here, they see this and they're just afraid of what's going to happen next.
[01:15:37.302 --> 01:15:41.384]   Absolutely. It's just insane. There's no doubt who's pushing the borders of NATO.
[01:15:41.384 --> 01:15:44.502]   There's no doubt who's shipping in high-tech weapons. There's no doubt who's trying to
[01:15:44.502 --> 01:15:46.893]  start a war with Russia and it should concern us all.
[01:15:46.893 --> 01:15:48.502]  Patrick Lancaster, thank you so much.
[01:15:48.502 --> 01:15:52.423]  Look forward to speaking to you again. Thank you.
[01:15:52.409 --> 01:15:53.409]  It'll be great.
[01:15:53.409 --> 01:15:58.328]   All right, folks, I'm going to open the phones up in the third and fourth hour.
[01:15:58.328 --> 01:15:59.569]  I'll give the number out.
[01:15:59.569 --> 01:16:00.768]  Norm Pattis is joining us.
[01:16:00.768 --> 01:16:07.449]   I got to respond to the $75 million Sandy Hook situation, not with me, but with Remington,
[01:16:07.449 --> 01:16:08.448]  our oldest gun manufacturer.
[01:16:08.448 --> 01:16:09.448]  It's bankrupt.
[01:16:09.448 --> 01:16:10.448]  Don't worry.
[01:16:10.448 --> 01:16:11.448]  They're shut down.
[01:16:11.448 --> 01:16:12.448]  They don't make guns anymore.
[01:16:12.448 --> 01:16:14.968]  So you know a man by his enemies.
[01:16:14.968 --> 01:16:16.169]  That's who we are.
[01:16:16.182 --> 01:16:21.983]  As for us, we've not declared bankruptcy and don't plan on it, and we plan to just fight forever, and they're never gonna shut us up.
[01:16:22.023 --> 01:16:26.825]  In fact, I was quite frankly five years ago planning to phase out and retire within five years.
[01:16:27.485 --> 01:16:28.925]  Ain't retiring now, suckas.
[01:16:29.385 --> 01:16:31.246]  Gonna be doing nighttime shows and everything else.
[01:16:31.606 --> 01:16:32.226]  People come after me?
[01:16:35.182 --> 01:16:37.766]  So now the globalists have declared war on me and my family?
[01:16:38.187 --> 01:16:45.760]  Well, we are going to turn up the heat and open up the cans of anti-New World Order resistance, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:47.774 --> 01:16:54.056]  I need money to prosecute war of information and truth, and I need money at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:16:54.356 --> 01:16:55.456]  I got the best durable food.
[01:16:55.576 --> 01:16:56.456]  I got the best supplements.
[01:16:56.616 --> 01:17:00.857]  We got amazing t-shirts, because there are better t-shirt designers than me out there, but ours are pretty good.
[01:17:01.177 --> 01:17:04.938]  We've got incredible everything, films, books, everything.
[01:17:05.138 --> 01:17:06.399]  It's an arsenal of freedom.
[01:17:06.439 --> 01:17:07.679]  It's an arsenal of resistance.
[01:17:08.059 --> 01:17:09.440]  InfoWarStore.com.
[01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:13.781]  And the X3 sale's gonna end in about a week.
[01:17:13.821 --> 01:17:14.321]  Amazing.
[01:17:14.361 --> 01:17:16.522]  If you don't know what X3 does, look into it for yourself.
[01:17:16.922 --> 01:17:18.422]  Storeable food deals extend until Wednesday.
[01:17:18.442 --> 01:17:20.283]  25% off first deal in four years.
[01:17:20.803 --> 01:17:22.143]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:17:23.264 --> 01:17:25.344]  And then we will continue to give you the truth.
[01:17:25.364 --> 01:17:27.185]  We will continue to stand against the New World Order.
[01:17:27.225 --> 01:17:28.725]  We will continue to not back down.
[01:17:28.786 --> 01:17:30.766]  Because I will never give up.
[01:17:31.746 --> 01:17:33.247]  I will never back down.
[01:17:34.187 --> 01:17:35.388]  But I could collapse.
[01:17:35.568 --> 01:17:36.609]  I could give out.
[01:17:36.969 --> 01:17:38.690]  And it's you that's going to hold us up in this fight.
[01:17:38.910 --> 01:17:42.192]  And I need money to prosecute this war against Soros and the New World Order.
[01:17:42.392 --> 01:17:43.933]  Our defensive war for our children.
[01:17:44.253 --> 01:17:45.414]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:17:45.474 --> 01:17:46.114]  Go there now.
[01:17:46.334 --> 01:17:50.437]  We need major funding in our counteroffensive against the New World Order.
[01:17:50.597 --> 01:17:52.118]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:17:53.144 --> 01:18:04.209]  All right, we've got giant news and inside intel that's massive that I'll hit next hour and then take your calls into the fourth hour today on the Durham investigation and just how seismic that is.
[01:18:05.469 --> 01:18:27.033]   But I wanted to get one of the top criminal and First Amendment lawyers, civil rights lawyers in the country, all lawyers say they're the top, but he really is one of the top two or three guys in the country, Norm Pattis, to join us about this big 75 million dollar settlement with Remington, the bankrupted U.S.
[01:18:27.073 --> 01:18:33.674]  gun company, the first gun company in America, in the U.S., first supplied our first military.
[01:18:34.775 --> 01:18:48.714]   They have, after having the Supreme Court say that the whole trial can go ahead and all this litigation and fights can continue after a six year battle or so, That they've now settled for $75 million.
[01:18:49.415 --> 01:18:59.181]  Now, the same law firm hooked in with Senator Blumenthal and others, the stolen Glory guy that claimed he was in combat in Vietnam and all the rest of it, never left the U.S., had a cush job at the D.C.
[01:18:59.221 --> 01:19:03.724]  Capitol, literally collecting toys for children, which is fine, but he's a liar, a fraud.
[01:19:04.104 --> 01:19:08.164]   He runs all this basically from my research and his son's in a law firm and they're all
[01:19:08.164 --> 01:19:09.443]  involved there.
[01:19:09.443 --> 01:19:12.504]   The Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton, who's now been caught in the Durham investigation
[01:19:12.504 --> 01:19:17.004]  with her crimes, boy the ship is sinking for these guys.
[01:19:17.004 --> 01:19:23.943]   They have come out and declared victory, $75 million and this is a signal that no gun manufacturer
[01:19:23.943 --> 01:19:25.963]  is safe in America.
[01:19:25.963 --> 01:19:32.404]   And the UN and the Democratic Party are involved in, with the Mexican government, suing gun
[01:19:32.404 --> 01:19:42.564]   manufacturers saying guns from the US to Mexico is our fault, when it was Fast and Furious, where Obama ordered hundreds of thousands of guns shipped into Mexico on record!
[01:19:42.844 --> 01:19:45.466]  But that'll never come out, because the judges will never let that in court.
[01:19:46.247 --> 01:19:48.048]  So this is a false flag against our Second Amendment.
[01:19:48.509 --> 01:20:01.113]   But I wanted to get Norm Pattis' take on this, because, you know, we've had these Democratic Party law firms that represent these parents, Come out against the First Amendment, in my case.
[01:20:01.593 --> 01:20:02.894]  Come out against the Second Amendment.
[01:20:03.774 --> 01:20:05.955]  And now they've got their $75 million.
[01:20:05.995 --> 01:20:09.517]  Do you expect them and all their lawsuits against me to go away?
[01:20:09.557 --> 01:20:10.617]  And obviously the answer is not.
[01:20:10.637 --> 01:20:13.939]  Because there's never enough people that have to pay for the dead children.
[01:20:13.959 --> 01:20:17.340]  I have people come up to me in the street and say, you killed those kids.
[01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:18.441]  And I say, really?
[01:20:18.461 --> 01:20:19.341]  And they go, yeah.
[01:20:19.361 --> 01:20:22.563]  It's happened in front of my family at least three times in the last year.
[01:20:22.583 --> 01:20:24.184]  Because the public's so dumbed down.
[01:20:24.844 --> 01:20:26.725]  No one knows Adam Lanza's name.
[01:20:27.461 --> 01:20:29.261]  So Norm Pattis will be with us 20 minutes to the next hour.
[01:20:29.321 --> 01:20:31.262]  I appreciate him holding, but here's some of the background.
[01:20:31.282 --> 01:20:31.982]  FBI.
[01:20:32.342 --> 01:20:33.382]  Resident Warren police.
[01:20:33.422 --> 01:20:34.282]  Sandy Hook shooter.
[01:20:34.342 --> 01:20:35.623]  Threatened to kill mom students.
[01:20:36.823 --> 01:20:37.643]  Newtown, Connecticut.
[01:20:37.983 --> 01:20:38.683]  Are they liable?
[01:20:39.363 --> 01:20:39.584]  No.
[01:20:41.064 --> 01:20:45.985]  Newly released FBI documents reveal disturbing details about Sandy Hook shooter Adam Lanza.
[01:20:46.305 --> 01:20:49.766]  No one knows his name because he's now Alex Jones.
[01:20:51.186 --> 01:20:57.042]   New FBI released documents with real disturbing details about Sandy Hook shooter Alex Jones.
[01:20:58.283 --> 01:21:00.044]  Because that's literally who I am now.
[01:21:00.645 --> 01:21:02.326]  With brain-dead leftist voters.
[01:21:03.207 --> 01:21:03.747]  Very, very sad.
[01:21:04.007 --> 01:21:05.689]  I didn't build my operation on them.
[01:21:05.789 --> 01:21:07.991]  I hardly ever talked about it at the level they say.
[01:21:09.170 --> 01:21:10.832]  But they have made me the Sandy Hook guy.
[01:21:10.852 --> 01:21:13.294]  They've attached themselves to me, the lawyers, the Democrats.
[01:21:13.935 --> 01:21:18.699]  Like they attached themselves to the Second Amendment and are taking it down and now they want my free speech.
[01:21:18.739 --> 01:21:22.923]  Meanwhile, Judge throws out Palin libel case against the New York Times.
[01:21:23.323 --> 01:21:25.685]  You see, the New York Times gets things wrong on purpose.
[01:21:25.765 --> 01:21:27.167]  They lie on purpose.
[01:21:27.547 --> 01:21:34.654]  Alex Jones makes mistakes sometimes, not often, but when he does, he's evil because he is a citizen blogger on the radio.
[01:21:35.034 --> 01:21:36.015]  He has to be shut down.
[01:21:36.495 --> 01:21:40.857]  So Norm Pattis of Pattis Law joins us right now to discuss this.
[01:21:40.877 --> 01:21:43.198]  We haven't pre-war game this or talked before.
[01:21:43.218 --> 01:21:47.260]  I just called him before I went live and said, you want to come on in a couple hours?
[01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:47.881]  He said, sure.
[01:21:48.301 --> 01:21:51.062]  And so here he is right now to give his take on all this.
[01:21:51.102 --> 01:21:52.043]  Norm, great to have you on with us.
[01:21:53.043 --> 01:21:53.503]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:21:53.523 --> 01:21:56.105]  No, it's a shocking settlement as reported.
[01:21:56.145 --> 01:21:57.846]  And, you know, details are hard to come by.
[01:21:58.206 --> 01:22:04.189]  The Costco firm gave a press conference this morning, and that has been widely reported on, as reported in The Wall Street Journal.
[01:22:04.694 --> 01:22:09.642]  Um, previously, there was an offer to settle the case for, I think, $32 or $33 million.
[01:22:09.982 --> 01:22:16.913]  That represented the policy limit for two of the four insurance companies that were defending, or responsible for defending, Remington.
[01:22:17.463 --> 01:22:24.386]  Now all four insurance companies have tendered or offered their policy limits, and that is $73 million.
[01:22:24.826 --> 01:22:28.168]  Presumably that will settle the case for the nine families involved.
[01:22:28.688 --> 01:22:37.692]  What I find particularly shocking about this is that it eviscerates, eliminates, erases traditional notions of proximate cause.
[01:22:38.492 --> 01:22:50.815]   Usually in a case involving personal injury, you have to show that the acts or omissions of the person you're suing actually cause legally cause damage to another person. In this case the
[01:22:50.815 --> 01:22:54.886]   plaintiffs are legislating by litigation. They're deciding what the law
[01:22:54.886 --> 01:22:59.516]   should be and they're terrorizing or attempting to terrorize private
[01:22:59.516 --> 01:23:03.835]   industry into doing what they think is right. Now what's the legal background
[01:23:03.835 --> 01:23:07.995]   here? Remington was sued under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practice Act which
[01:23:07.995 --> 01:23:15.456]   makes it possible to pursue a company if they engage in immoral or unscrupulous
[01:23:15.456 --> 01:23:16.216]  advertising.
[01:23:16.216 --> 01:23:21.896]   Because Remington marketed these devices as tools for combat and presumably
[01:23:21.896 --> 01:23:25.816]   targeted young men for those and Adam Lanza had the gun, never mind that his
[01:23:25.816 --> 01:23:28.655]  mother bought it.
[01:23:27.196 --> 01:23:31.458]  She wasn't the one who was targeted for advertising.
[01:23:31.618 --> 01:23:38.520]  Therefore, this represented an exception to the federal bar on suits against gun manufacturers.
[01:23:39.042 --> 01:23:42.963]  It was an extremely close case in the Connecticut Supreme Court, decided 4-3.
[01:23:43.103 --> 01:23:44.543]  The U.S.
[01:23:44.583 --> 01:23:49.544]  Supreme Court decided not to weigh in, and the result was the case could advance for trial.
[01:23:50.405 --> 01:23:54.505]  But here's what's highly unusual, and makes you wonder, kind of, what's going on.
[01:23:54.966 --> 01:24:01.407]  Because the case involving Remington and the Sandy Hook families was set to start trial in September.
[01:24:02.054 --> 01:24:09.439]  There's another trial that is set to start in September, and that's the case of the Sandy Hook families versus Free Speech Systems and Alex Jones.
[01:24:09.859 --> 01:24:13.301]  So how are those two trials going to take place simultaneously?
[01:24:13.721 --> 01:24:16.083]  Well, they... Now let's be clear, the same law firm?
[01:24:16.623 --> 01:24:17.644]  The same Democrat law firm?
[01:24:19.084 --> 01:24:22.887]  The same firm... I think some overlapping plaintiffs.
[01:24:22.947 --> 01:24:23.787]  I'm not sure about that.
[01:24:23.847 --> 01:24:28.030]  I haven't compared the plaintiffs in the case against you to the plaintiffs in Remington.
[01:24:28.846 --> 01:24:39.692]  But the same firm was going to be on trial, allegedly, at the same time against two folks, or two groups of defendants, demonized regarding the... That's right, I mean, everybody's got to pay these people.
[01:24:39.752 --> 01:24:43.014]  I mean, my God, they would go back in a time machine and make Jesus pay some money.
[01:24:43.695 --> 01:24:49.578]  I mean, it's Remington, it's the police are sued, the teachers are sued, they might sue the Easter Bunny next.
[01:24:50.891 --> 01:24:58.479]  Well, you make a facetious point, but it involves an important principle, and that is the notion of proximate cause.
[01:24:58.879 --> 01:25:04.585]  But for the fact that we all got out of bed this morning, we wouldn't be aware of all the suffering in the world.
[01:25:04.985 --> 01:25:09.904]   Is the fact that we woke up, does that make us responsible for that suffering?
[01:25:09.904 --> 01:25:11.465]  Somebody pay us for what we viewed?
[01:25:11.465 --> 01:25:13.744]  No, that's what's called but-for causation.
[01:25:13.744 --> 01:25:18.706]   The world is a string of causation of events linked to one another when looked back at
[01:25:18.706 --> 01:25:20.706]  from a certain perspective in time.
[01:25:20.706 --> 01:25:24.626]   But proximate cause says there has to be some limitation on causation.
[01:25:24.626 --> 01:25:30.265]   And usually the doctrines that reign in limitations on causation are an identifiable victim, an
[01:25:30.265 --> 01:25:34.824]   imminent risk of harm where it was foreseeable that the person would be harmed.
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:44.126]  Now if Remington had had the balls to try that case and put it on in front of a jury, they could have said, look, maybe the advertising was irresponsible.
[01:25:44.406 --> 01:25:52.591]  But it's not proximately related to Adam Lanza's decision to go out and wipe out a classroom of first graders and the adults trying to protect them.
[01:25:53.011 --> 01:25:54.112]  It was a horrible event.
[01:25:54.572 --> 01:25:58.053]  No one is here to justify or excuse what Mr. Lanza did.
[01:25:58.473 --> 01:26:09.077]  But when the Koskoff firm can say, look, our purpose in bringing this litigation was to send a message to manufacturers, to banks and insurers, you know, don't stand behind these folks.
[01:26:09.357 --> 01:26:16.620]  They're trying to do by legislative, or by litigation fiat, what the Second Amendment prohibits and what legislation...
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:22.382]  They're filing lawsuits in deep blue areas and saying, hey, let's shut down the free speech of conservatives.
[01:26:22.662 --> 01:26:24.543]  Let's shut down the rights of all gun owners.
[01:26:24.883 --> 01:26:30.104]  It's literally East Coast controlled areas suing to take the Midwesterners guns.
[01:26:30.204 --> 01:26:31.985]  I mean, this and they brag about this.
[01:26:32.545 --> 01:26:34.086]  Norm, you know, I'm just going to say this stuff.
[01:26:34.106 --> 01:26:36.046]  I didn't learn this from you, but I'm just going to bring it up right now.
[01:26:36.867 --> 01:26:38.947]  They want me to come out against the Second Amendment.
[01:26:39.087 --> 01:26:40.468]  Hell will freeze over before I do it.
[01:26:41.195 --> 01:26:42.936]  And they want $500 million.
[01:26:43.096 --> 01:26:44.897]  I don't have a million dollars in cash.
[01:26:45.637 --> 01:26:45.938]  Okay?
[01:26:46.258 --> 01:26:48.599]  So, so, it's just insane.
[01:26:48.719 --> 01:26:51.301]  They want us off air, and it ain't gonna happen.
[01:26:51.521 --> 01:26:57.404]  They might be able to come to this building and shut this down, but Mr. Alex Jones is gonna be bigger than ever, which I know they're mad about.
[01:26:57.684 --> 01:26:59.365]  I don't know how much of that you know about, Norm, but...
[01:27:00.504 --> 01:27:03.046]  I learned about that from the folks at GCN.
[01:27:03.447 --> 01:27:05.188]  They want $500 million.
[01:27:05.228 --> 01:27:06.369]  GCN doesn't have $5 million.
[01:27:06.389 --> 01:27:08.891]  Why don't they say $50 million?
[01:27:08.911 --> 01:27:09.251]  $100 million?
[01:27:09.572 --> 01:27:17.098]  Because it's all about control and shutting down speech, and they just put these big numbers up there to terrorize people, Norm.
[01:27:18.354 --> 01:27:19.776]  It's about optics.
[01:27:20.537 --> 01:27:22.940]  I think they will have bragging rights.
[01:27:23.341 --> 01:27:30.430]  If they can obtain a large verdict against you, which would result in shutting free speech systems down, they'll say they silenced Alex Jones.
[01:27:30.751 --> 01:27:33.074]  But as you pointed out, they'll never silence Alex Jones.
[01:27:33.194 --> 01:27:37.594]   Alex Jones. You will re-emerge in another context and you will re-emerge because the
[01:27:37.594 --> 01:27:42.234]   thing that they don't understand is that you speak to a sense of populist rage around the
[01:27:42.234 --> 01:27:48.373]   country which won't be slaked by elitist lawsuits shutting down people's rights to express themselves
[01:27:48.373 --> 01:27:49.373]  or defend themselves.
[01:27:49.373 --> 01:27:53.673]   Well let me just say this, do you think we should have maybe 50 billion to the families
[01:27:53.673 --> 01:27:54.954]  and of course the law firm first?
[01:27:55.295 --> 01:28:00.939]  Maybe the Democratic Party, now that they own gunshot victims, they own all this, maybe we should all just give all our wealth to them.
[01:28:01.179 --> 01:28:02.240]  I mean, because how much money?
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:03.540]  Is $73 million enough?
[01:28:03.801 --> 01:28:04.781]  Is all the other money enough?
[01:28:04.821 --> 01:28:07.703]  Is the hundreds of millions they raised off of all their charities enough?
[01:28:07.763 --> 01:28:11.586]  I mean, I know we're all collectively guilty for their children dying.
[01:28:12.386 --> 01:28:13.928]  I just want to know, what is enough?
[01:28:13.988 --> 01:28:15.489]  And the answer is, nothing.
[01:28:15.649 --> 01:28:22.834]  We want your speech, we want your country, we want your self-defense, and George Soros runs your DA's, he's gonna take your police away.
[01:28:23.835 --> 01:28:25.696]  Well, Norm Pattis was on fire during the break.
[01:28:27.998 --> 01:28:43.634]   So I want him to repeat what he just said to me, during the break, on air, about what this Vicious blow to the right of self-defense means, and now the same organization is setting it aside to their own words on the First Amendment.
[01:28:44.074 --> 01:28:44.595]  Norm Pattis.
[01:28:45.808 --> 01:28:49.230]  No, these eye-popping numbers aren't about money.
[01:28:49.530 --> 01:28:50.551]  They're about control.
[01:28:50.891 --> 01:28:54.693]  And if you can be starved into submission, the goal is submission.
[01:28:55.113 --> 01:28:57.255]  And so this company was put out of business.
[01:28:57.475 --> 01:29:01.677]  They're aiming to put you out of business and to put free speech systems out of business.
[01:29:01.997 --> 01:29:08.381]  And they're aiming, maybe even they harbor the fantasy of taking over the studio and transforming it into the broadcast that they want.
[01:29:08.721 --> 01:29:15.065]  But the point is they're failing to realize that you're responding to a need in the public at large that they can't satisfy.
[01:29:15.565 --> 01:29:17.726]  Um, so the info war will continue.
[01:29:17.786 --> 01:29:20.846]  It will just move to another forum if they are successful.
[01:29:21.146 --> 01:29:23.747]  Now, I'm, you know, you've had... And you just let the cat out of the bag.
[01:29:23.847 --> 01:29:29.228]  I mean, they approached GCN and said, let us just take the show over and put our own stuff on or take him off the air.
[01:29:29.248 --> 01:29:31.148]  I mean, that's how crazy this is.
[01:29:31.489 --> 01:29:35.029]  The left is so entitled with all their elitist power and money.
[01:29:35.049 --> 01:29:37.170]  They believe they don't just get to shut us up.
[01:29:37.450 --> 01:29:39.310]  They get to move in to who we were.
[01:29:39.330 --> 01:29:40.511]  It doesn't work like that.
[01:29:41.731 --> 01:29:52.231]   The single most A significant threat to civil liberties, in my view at least, in our lifetime, in the next 10 years, is going to be a struggle over what I call the politics of virtue.
[01:29:52.931 --> 01:30:08.137]  There is a struggle for the levers of control by those who think we know how best to live, both in terms of public health, global security, climate change, with respect to guns, with respect to speech, with respect to speech code, with respect to what we can do.
[01:30:08.497 --> 01:30:14.476]   They're aided and assisted by large algorithms that can be programmed to respond to that
[01:30:14.476 --> 01:30:19.297]   vision of the good and we're going to see increasing efforts at social control which
[01:30:19.297 --> 01:30:22.457]  will reach down to the ordinary person in their pocketbook.
[01:30:22.457 --> 01:30:28.056]   Your credit card will become a means of depriving you of access to things when the code isn't
[01:30:28.056 --> 01:30:31.536]  accepted because your social utility score isn't right.
[01:30:31.536 --> 01:30:32.817]  That's from the bottom up.
[01:30:32.817 --> 01:30:37.856]   From the top down, large institutions will be crippled or bankrupt or taken over with
[01:30:37.856 --> 01:30:40.417]  large judgments if they can be obtained.
[01:30:40.370 --> 01:30:53.314]   So, you know, I don't know what the guys in the executive suite at Remington were thinking, but this is a case that should have been fought and a jury of ordinary people might have reached a different I'm hoping they will do in the case against you, Alex.
[01:30:53.774 --> 01:31:00.500]  I don't have any doubt that Remington's lawyers will come out swinging and ask for tens if not hundreds of millions in a jury trial.
[01:31:00.900 --> 01:31:08.727]  And we will ask a jury to follow the law and to use their common sense and to conclude that if they came for you first, they're coming for these jurors next.
[01:31:09.127 --> 01:31:11.850]  And in the end, there's no satisfying a Republican version.
[01:31:11.870 --> 01:31:17.535]  But I mean Norm, listen, I've been in four years of litigation, you've been out here three plus years, you've been in all our books, everything.
[01:31:18.255 --> 01:31:22.617]  I don't have a half million dollars in my personal bank account, which I enjoy.
[01:31:22.757 --> 01:31:30.421]  It's so hilarious that I can pop up anywhere and reach all the same systems, be bigger than ever, and they think they're going to get money, and they're not.
[01:31:30.641 --> 01:31:32.301]  Because we know, though, they now know that.
[01:31:32.622 --> 01:31:33.422]  They don't want money.
[01:31:33.462 --> 01:31:35.543]  Like you said, they want to silence us.
[01:31:36.123 --> 01:31:42.106]  That was a cherry on top after they shut down our oldest gun manufacturer, Remington, to get that money from their insurance carriers.
[01:31:43.906 --> 01:31:46.187]  It was, and it was a sign of what's to come.
[01:31:46.468 --> 01:31:49.449]  I mean, I'm just shocked by this.
[01:31:49.469 --> 01:31:51.430]  I think it's bad for the civil justice system.
[01:31:51.711 --> 01:31:54.772]  I think it's going to encourage legislation by litigation.
[01:31:55.193 --> 01:31:59.432]   ambitious plaintiffs' lawyers everywhere are going to try to use the bankruptcy code to
[01:31:59.432 --> 01:32:04.432]   enforce their visions of the good, and we will enter into a form of economic warfare
[01:32:04.432 --> 01:32:10.012]   disguised as litigation where the rights of the non-well-heeled, those without financial
[01:32:10.012 --> 01:32:15.391]   backing, are going to be held in jeopardy by those who have financial backing and can
[01:32:15.391 --> 01:32:20.912]  turn the courts into a tool of extortion.
[01:32:20.793 --> 01:32:25.193]   all of the topping character is a nightmare for the civil justice system.
[01:32:25.193 --> 01:32:28.313]  It eviscerates traditional notions of legal causation.
[01:32:28.313 --> 01:32:30.712]  I totally agree, but here's the good news.
[01:32:30.712 --> 01:32:38.632]   Historically, bullying with Americans and, let's just say historically Anglo-Saxon ideas and thought
[01:32:38.632 --> 01:32:39.753]  does not go too well.
[01:32:39.794 --> 01:32:41.376]  Some places, intimidation works.
[01:32:41.796 --> 01:32:42.817]  It's going to blow up in their face.
[01:32:42.837 --> 01:32:44.259]  It's going to cause massive resistance.
[01:32:44.599 --> 01:32:46.141]  So, they bit off more than they can chew.
[01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:49.119]   Norm, let's come back and talk about the Sarah Palin case in the New York Times.
[01:32:49.119 --> 01:32:49.520]  Straight ahead.
[01:32:49.520 --> 01:33:02.640]   Something very rare is going on and it ends in just three days.
[01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:07.240]   As of the time I'm taping this announcement on Thursday afternoon.
[01:33:07.669 --> 01:33:15.875]  Coming up this Monday, the biggest sale in four years of high-quality, storable foods at preparewithalex.com will end.
[01:33:15.895 --> 01:33:23.220]  That's 25% off already the lowest prices you're going to find on high-quality, storable food at infowarrestore.com.
[01:33:24.633 --> 01:33:32.701]  Again, you can go to preparewithalex.com or infoworkstore.com and it takes you to the same place.
[01:33:32.721 --> 01:33:41.530]  50% off as well on super high quality products like X3, the Deep Earth Crystal Iodine.
[01:33:41.570 --> 01:33:43.452]  That sale is going on as well.
[01:33:43.893 --> 01:33:45.194]  It doesn't end on Monday.
[01:33:45.254 --> 01:33:47.977]  It'll end in a few weeks and we're almost sold out of the product.
[01:33:48.497 --> 01:33:50.798]  Oh, and let me add, Judge Andrew Napolitano is about to be joining us.
[01:33:50.637 --> 01:33:54.637]   So become self-sufficient now with the best high quality food at the lowest prices at
[01:33:54.637 --> 01:33:55.637]  m4store.com.
[01:33:55.637 --> 01:34:03.358]   Oh, and let me add, Judge Andrew Napolitano is about to be joining us.
[01:34:03.358 --> 01:34:04.358]  He was censored.
[01:34:04.358 --> 01:34:10.676]   He was suspended and it began the end of his career at Fox when he, five years ago, four
[01:34:10.676 --> 01:34:17.676]   and a half years ago in 2017 said, Hey, they were spying on Trump illegally and specifically
[01:34:17.676 --> 01:34:19.997]  gave details from his sources.
[01:34:19.997 --> 01:34:29.997]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:34:21.441 --> 01:34:23.363]  Now it's all vindicated with the Durham investigation.
[01:34:23.383 --> 01:34:24.323]  That's coming up in a few minutes.
[01:34:24.483 --> 01:34:32.048]  But getting back to these other legal issues, Norm Pattis, constitutional lawyer, what do you make of the Sarah Palin situation?
[01:34:32.108 --> 01:34:32.969]  I like Sarah Palin.
[01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:41.054]  I think it's wrong that the New York Times falsely said that she put crosshairs over the head of a Congresswoman and others that later got shot, six killed.
[01:34:42.674 --> 01:34:46.155]  But I believe in the First Amendment, and we can't prove they lied on purpose.
[01:34:46.955 --> 01:34:50.996]  I really think the New York Times versus Sullivan or Sullivan New York Times should stand.
[01:34:51.636 --> 01:34:56.738]  But it seems we're creating a system where the New York Times gets its speech, but Alex Jones doesn't get its speech.
[01:34:56.758 --> 01:34:58.478]  There's the Alex Jones exception.
[01:34:58.498 --> 01:34:59.618]  So I like Sarah Palin.
[01:35:00.098 --> 01:35:02.539]  But at the same time, she was a vice presidential candidate.
[01:35:03.610 --> 01:35:04.811]  She's been a big politician.
[01:35:05.292 --> 01:35:09.096]  She's in a big, you know, man-woman's world.
[01:35:09.136 --> 01:35:12.039]  And in my experience, you get in the arena, you better expect stuff.
[01:35:12.279 --> 01:35:17.344]  I mean, if I sued people every time they lied about me or said, you know, really bad things, I'd be in the court all day.
[01:35:17.744 --> 01:35:18.525]  That's my view.
[01:35:18.545 --> 01:35:19.987]  People say, why haven't I sued a bunch of people?
[01:35:20.007 --> 01:35:20.928]  Well, that's not who I am.
[01:35:21.568 --> 01:35:25.874]  I sued the January 6th committee with you because that's my private stuff and they don't deserve it and it's a lie.
[01:35:26.755 --> 01:35:35.086]  But just in closing, what do you make of the judge, while the jury deliberating, throwing out and saying they didn't have malice of forethought with intent to do harm?
[01:35:35.126 --> 01:35:36.268]  I mean, how do we know that?
[01:35:37.805 --> 01:35:49.915]  Well, all judges have a responsibility to prevent cases from getting to a jury unless there's sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find in favor of the plaintiff or the government if it's a criminal case.
[01:35:50.255 --> 01:35:52.517]  This judge concluded that Ms.
[01:35:52.557 --> 01:35:58.182]  Palin had not produced at trial sufficient evidence of malice to permit the case to go to judgment.
[01:35:58.342 --> 01:36:01.605]  However, the judge did something very, very significant.
[01:36:01.885 --> 01:36:06.509]  He basically took a reservation on that decision and he's letting the jury continue to deliberate.
[01:36:07.189 --> 01:36:14.132]  So that if the jury disagrees and says it did, and the case goes up for appeal, they won't have to retry the case.
[01:36:14.172 --> 01:36:15.693]  So it's an unconventional move.
[01:36:16.333 --> 01:36:18.374]  The judge is a guy named Ned Rakoff.
[01:36:18.414 --> 01:36:20.334]  He's a very bright person.
[01:36:20.655 --> 01:36:23.076]  I've seen these sort of reservations taken before.
[01:36:23.436 --> 01:36:28.898]  But the larger issue is whether the New York Times' V. Sullivan will survive.
[01:36:29.378 --> 01:36:38.681]  And whether as to public figures, there will be a finding of actual malice as necessary for a case to get to a jury on defamation.
[01:36:39.101 --> 01:36:45.683]  Now, you know, Palin, I guess, got lucky that the plaintiffs didn't, you know, move for a default against her.
[01:36:46.024 --> 01:36:49.205]  We wanted to raise the same defense in your case.
[01:36:50.085 --> 01:36:59.646]   And, you know, as the case evolved, the Koskoff plaintiffs were able to create an image of what your company should look like and persuaded judge because it didn't look that way.
[01:36:59.646 --> 01:37:03.487]   You weren't complying with discovery and she entered a disciplinary default.
[01:37:03.487 --> 01:37:08.047]   We disagree with that ruling and if necessary, we'll take an appeal at the
[01:37:08.047 --> 01:37:13.646]   appropriate moment. But, you know, the first amendment is on the line everywhere
[01:37:13.646 --> 01:37:16.207]  and, you know, public to protect debate.
[01:37:16.207 --> 01:37:20.327]   The New York Times versus Sullivan has said of public figures that you have to
[01:37:20.327 --> 01:37:21.926]  prove more than that.
[01:37:21.926 --> 01:37:24.605]  A speaker got something wrong.
[01:37:24.605 --> 01:37:26.207]  You have to prove actual malice.
[01:37:26.207 --> 01:37:29.407]  Some people say that standard is too high.
[01:37:29.407 --> 01:37:32.407]  I'm able so I'm.
[01:37:32.259 --> 01:37:34.601]  Um, to, um, have the same standard for everyone.
[01:37:34.661 --> 01:37:35.921]  Norm, Norm, your sky is breaking up a bit.
[01:37:36.001 --> 01:37:38.103]  I mean, I'm a lay person, but all I know is this.
[01:37:38.583 --> 01:37:42.785]  The New York Times gets one treatment, which I think the First Amendment sacrosanct, they should get that.
[01:37:42.805 --> 01:37:46.908]  Unless there's a smoking gun that they light on purpose, you know, they shouldn't be in trouble.
[01:37:47.961 --> 01:37:51.223]  And then over here, though, the other side defaults us.
[01:37:51.363 --> 01:37:52.303]  We give them all our stuff.
[01:37:52.323 --> 01:37:53.644]  They lie and say we didn't give it to them.
[01:37:53.964 --> 01:37:58.906]  And then now I'm just guilty, the judge says, and then I've got to be shut down.
[01:37:59.286 --> 01:38:05.269]  That is extremely dangerous, and that goes with everything else we're seeing, where justice is one way for the left and one way for the right.
[01:38:06.761 --> 01:38:16.729]  Well, I think there's a growing tendency to want to protect mainstream media and say of citizen bloggers that we're not journalists, that we don't have First Amendment protection.
[01:38:17.009 --> 01:38:18.310]  The case law says we do.
[01:38:18.710 --> 01:38:24.034]  Not everyone has to have the editorial board of the New York Times in their back pocket to vet their utterances.
[01:38:24.333 --> 01:38:27.693]  So I think there is a double standard emerging in the law.
[01:38:27.693 --> 01:38:33.773]   The mainstream media, the New York Times, CNN, the large networks, they're going to
[01:38:33.773 --> 01:38:37.773]   be held to one standard which is permissive because they're going to be assumed to be
[01:38:37.773 --> 01:38:41.212]  doing the responsible thing, vetting, fact-checking.
[01:38:41.212 --> 01:38:45.733]   Those of us who don't have those resources are going to be penalized for speaking our
[01:38:45.733 --> 01:38:52.012]   minds and the elimination of actual malice as a standard is going to have an inhibiting
[01:38:52.012 --> 01:38:56.934]   effect on speech, speech of ordinary people, people like you, people like me.
[01:38:56.934 --> 01:38:59.894]   Well that's right, if you're not a big powerful corporation, you don't get speech because
[01:38:59.894 --> 01:39:03.974]   you're not, you know, have a huge fact-checking group behind you that's obviously a bunch
[01:39:03.974 --> 01:39:05.173]  of corporate liars.
[01:39:05.173 --> 01:39:06.894]  Thank you so much, Norm Paddis for talking to us.
[01:39:06.894 --> 01:39:08.012]  Look forward to speaking to you again soon.
[01:39:08.012 --> 01:39:09.012]  Thank you.
[01:39:09.261 --> 01:39:09.922]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[01:39:09.862 --> 01:39:10.862]  Alex, be well.
[01:39:10.862 --> 01:39:14.780]   All right, we've got him for the rest of the hour, and I'm really, really excited.
[01:39:14.780 --> 01:39:20.341]   Former judge, former top Fox News host, completely vindicated on spying on Trump,
[01:39:20.341 --> 01:39:25.582]   got suspended at Fox for saying this four plus years ago, and then that was the slow decline
[01:39:25.582 --> 01:39:27.900]   that kind of locked him up, and we didn't hear much from him.
[01:39:27.900 --> 01:39:29.060]  Then I predicted what would happen.
[01:39:29.060 --> 01:39:32.662]   They would wait 'til people forgot about him by shutting him down and then get rid of him.
[01:39:32.662 --> 01:39:34.581]  Totally vindicated, a real hero.
[01:39:34.581 --> 01:39:37.862]   The Durham investigation, I'll be able to lay it all out on the other side
[01:39:37.862 --> 01:39:41.141]   or here in just a moment, but I wanted to play a short compilation of him
[01:39:41.141 --> 01:39:46.422]   back in the time, 2017, doing what no other mainstream media person would do,
[01:39:46.422 --> 01:39:47.502]  tell the truth.
[01:39:47.502 --> 01:39:48.341]  Here it is.
[01:39:48.732 --> 01:39:55.358]  Former judge and frequent Fox News contributor Andrew Napolitano has reportedly been taken off the air for now.
[01:39:55.818 --> 01:40:06.126]  Multiple outlets say Napolitano has been sidelined at Fox for repeating on-air unverified claims that former President Obama asked UK intelligence to spy on Trump Tower.
[01:40:06.447 --> 01:40:08.528]  Did Barack Obama spy on Donald Trump?
[01:40:09.269 --> 01:40:14.593]  When President Obama was in the White House and President Trump was Mr. Trump running for office.
[01:40:15.054 --> 01:40:16.835]  Well, we don't really know the answer to that.
[01:40:17.015 --> 01:40:27.744]  Sources have told Fox News that President Obama could very easily have and probably did use a foreign intelligence service to gather this information for him.
[01:40:28.204 --> 01:40:34.889]  Three intelligence sources have informed Fox News that President Obama went outside the chain of command.
[01:40:35.130 --> 01:40:36.391]  He used GCHQ.
[01:40:37.151 --> 01:40:38.652]  What the heck is GCHQ?
[01:40:39.093 --> 01:40:43.577]  That's the initials for the British spying agency.
[01:40:43.817 --> 01:40:51.003]  Both White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer and President Trump defended accusations against Obama by pointing to Napolitano.
[01:40:51.163 --> 01:40:55.266]  Fox News' Shepard Smith walked back Napolitano's claim shortly thereafter.
[01:40:55.507 --> 01:40:59.250]  Fox News cannot confirm Judge Napolitano's commentary.
[01:40:59.750 --> 01:41:15.065]   Fox News knows of no evidence of All right, so, four plus years later, Judge Napolitano totally vindicated.
[01:41:15.085 --> 01:41:26.850]  We're about two minutes from break, but sir, I know you're not about vindicating yourself, but we could see you getting penalized, shut down, and then removed from error for telling the truth and going after Obama, Hillary, the whole deep state.
[01:41:26.890 --> 01:41:31.832]  Now you, I mean, you are like going to be the image of the dictionary next to the word vindication now.
[01:41:32.092 --> 01:41:33.693]  Thanks for joining us on Short Notice, Judge.
[01:41:34.626 --> 01:41:40.369]  You're very kind to say that, Alex, and thank you for running those old clips when my hair was a little darker.
[01:41:42.189 --> 01:41:45.531]  Look, I mean, I woke up yesterday morning like everybody else did.
[01:41:45.571 --> 01:41:49.793]  I hadn't paid attention to what Durham had filed over the weekend.
[01:41:50.753 --> 01:42:02.382]   But we now know that a significant arm of the federal government, armed with FBI agents and CIA agents, Is that the craziest thing in your career?
[01:42:02.402 --> 01:42:05.143]  I mean, in my life, I've never seen anything like this.
[01:42:05.023 --> 01:42:09.422]   his presidential campaign and on President Donald Trump after he was
[01:42:09.422 --> 01:42:11.942]  already the president of the United States.
[01:42:11.942 --> 01:42:15.362]   We now know that and the federal government of the United States
[01:42:15.362 --> 01:42:20.262]   acknowledges it, and if it has to, is prepared to prove it in court in
[01:42:20.262 --> 01:42:21.823]  the case against Michael Sussman.
[01:42:21.823 --> 01:42:25.143]  Is that the craziest thing in your career?
[01:42:25.143 --> 01:42:27.042]  I mean, in my life, I've never seen anything like this.
[01:42:27.042 --> 01:42:27.663]  This is crazy.
[01:42:27.663 --> 01:42:33.382]  Well, it was crazy because nobody would accept it.
[01:42:33.959 --> 01:42:35.560]  Nobody wanted to accept it.
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:40.043]  People came to me and begged to me, you owe President Obama an apology.
[01:42:40.223 --> 01:42:41.164]  For what?
[01:42:41.824 --> 01:42:58.477]   You know, about three months later, five GCHQ, that's British intelligence agents, went to the Guardian of London, a left-wing publication, and said, That judge in New York is correct.
[01:42:59.037 --> 01:43:01.278]  We didn't personally do it, but we know who did.
[01:43:01.658 --> 01:43:03.759]  So there was somewhat of a vindication then.
[01:43:03.799 --> 01:43:07.960]  The United States government, the Obama administration, still didn't accept it.
[01:43:08.561 --> 01:43:14.703]  But the filing from John Durham on Friday afternoon is so definitive.
[01:43:15.543 --> 01:43:24.248]   There's no way he could have made that filing unless he has the absolute proof I was going to say, it gets deeper, sir.
[01:43:24.288 --> 01:43:24.809]  Please stay there.
[01:43:24.849 --> 01:43:25.269]  We're right back.
[01:43:25.289 --> 01:43:26.229]  You're going to have the floor.
[01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:30.972]  We're so honored to have you because this is so big of the future of our country to expose this bureaucratic coup.
[01:43:31.012 --> 01:43:31.552]  We'll be right back.
[01:43:33.374 --> 01:43:40.277]  Well, I got to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, I am starstruck right now because I've always loved Judge Knapp, watching him decades on TV.
[01:43:40.297 --> 01:43:43.519]  I got to interview him before and, you know, hang out with him some in New York.
[01:43:43.559 --> 01:43:50.098]   But now that he's vindicated and been punished and basically taken off the air, For telling the truth.
[01:43:50.119 --> 01:43:55.582]  He was suspended and then phased out for exposing illegal deep state spying.
[01:43:55.602 --> 01:44:06.188]  And now we know it wasn't just the British, it wasn't just these private corporations, but then the government was involved and the wheels are coming off this and we're just blessed to have him here to lay this all out.
[01:44:06.228 --> 01:44:10.591]  Be sure and bookmark his site and find his weekday show, JudgeNap.com.
[01:44:11.031 --> 01:44:12.212]  JudgeNap.com.
[01:44:13.052 --> 01:44:17.735]  Judge, I wonder, I'm not going to criticize Fox News or others, but are they going to have you on for a victory lap?
[01:44:18.595 --> 01:44:25.739]  Now that you're so incredibly vindicated, I mean that's probably a tongue-in-cheek question, but you were saying this is a huge deal.
[01:44:25.799 --> 01:44:26.400]  It certainly is.
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:39.927]  Explain to us why this is so definitive and what this Durham investigation means and now the former head of national intelligence and all these folks say dozens of more indictments are coming out because they quote gave Durham the documents.
[01:44:39.947 --> 01:44:40.608]  What does all this mean?
[01:44:42.796 --> 01:44:51.662]  Well, I don't know about the indictments, because some of these crimes have a five-year statute of limitations, and much of this happened in 2016, so do the math.
[01:44:52.442 --> 01:44:55.905]  We're beyond the five years, which means Hillary herself may skate.
[01:44:56.065 --> 01:45:09.293]  However, if this was a conspiracy, and apparently it was, and if John Durham can report it, the five years is measured when the crime is completed, not when the crime started.
[01:45:09.333 --> 01:45:14.755]   So it would depend How far into the Trump administration the conspiracy extended?
[01:45:15.316 --> 01:45:19.559]  If the conspiracy ended on election day, it's too late to do anything about it.
[01:45:19.879 --> 01:45:27.525]  But it appears from the documents that John Durham filed on Friday afternoon, that the conspiracy did not end on election day.
[01:45:28.166 --> 01:45:40.335]  It appears that there was a conversation in the Oval Office after Trump was elected, in which President Obama himself participated.
[01:45:41.158 --> 01:45:45.980]  And discussions were had about using federal assets to spy on him.
[01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:50.661]  And there are two very interesting people present there besides the President Obama.
[01:45:51.242 --> 01:45:59.084]  One is Jake Sullivan, who was Mrs. Clinton's chief intelligence advisor on spying and intelligence matters.
[01:45:59.605 --> 01:46:04.086]  He's now President Joe Biden's national security director.
[01:46:04.106 --> 01:46:08.128]  He has the highest national security clearance in the country.
[01:46:08.188 --> 01:46:09.408]  It's the same as the President's.
[01:46:10.134 --> 01:46:13.376]  The other interesting person there was Vice President Joe Biden.
[01:46:14.556 --> 01:46:16.577]  Now this, of course, was four years ago.
[01:46:16.917 --> 01:46:24.601]  Was he part, Alex, was he part of the conspiracy to undermine Donald Trump's presidency?
[01:46:25.325 --> 01:46:27.166]  By using federal assets.
[01:46:27.607 --> 01:46:29.288]  You know, you can compare this to Watergate.
[01:46:29.648 --> 01:46:42.156]  Watergate was the use of private assets paid for by the Republican National Committee to break into an office and seize proof of who was having sex with whom and who was paying who off.
[01:46:42.777 --> 01:46:44.998]  This is the use of federal assets.
[01:46:46.039 --> 01:46:48.241]  Jim Comey, all the way on the left there.
[01:46:48.981 --> 01:46:51.142]  John Brennan had the FBI at the time.
[01:46:51.203 --> 01:46:53.264]  John Brennan, all the way on the right there.
[01:46:53.752 --> 01:46:55.333]  Head of the CIA at the time.
[01:46:55.733 --> 01:47:06.440]  So this is, according to Durham, the use of federal assets to undermine a presidency.
[01:47:06.661 --> 01:47:09.102]  Now that is a half dozen different crimes there.
[01:47:09.122 --> 01:47:17.548]  It would just depend upon when these crimes were committed, or when this conspiracy ended, or how much fortitude Durham has and who he goes after.
[01:47:18.397 --> 01:47:30.700]  So there's been a lot of criticism of Durham taking years and years, but to me, I'm not a famous judge like you or a legal scholar, but this is like a super big ballsy move to do this with Merrick Garland as the Attorney General and all this.
[01:47:30.740 --> 01:47:35.041]  I mean, this is like the hydrogen bomb effect, because we knew it was going on.
[01:47:35.081 --> 01:47:38.742]  I should ask you how you knew from your sources, but we had our sources.
[01:47:38.782 --> 01:47:39.922]  We were talking about it, too.
[01:47:39.962 --> 01:47:42.103]  But this is just such a big deal.
[01:47:42.403 --> 01:47:47.064]  This has got to really concern, as you said, not just Hillary, but clearly this goes above that.
[01:47:48.641 --> 01:47:50.423]  Well, you know, it does.
[01:47:50.523 --> 01:47:52.465]  And I know you want to talk about this eventually.
[01:47:52.786 --> 01:47:55.068]  Why isn't the media covering this?
[01:47:55.589 --> 01:48:00.554]  Why is Infowars and Newsmax and Fox News and the Wall Street Journal?
[01:48:00.594 --> 01:48:00.935]  Exactly.
[01:48:00.975 --> 01:48:02.056]  I should have said that first.
[01:48:02.176 --> 01:48:03.037]  No one's covering.
[01:48:03.057 --> 01:48:06.301]  I mean, this makes Watergate look like a child's play.
[01:48:06.321 --> 01:48:07.302]  I mean, this is huge.
[01:48:07.462 --> 01:48:07.943]  It does.
[01:48:08.423 --> 01:48:08.964]  Yes, it does.
[01:48:09.024 --> 01:48:09.624]  This should be.
[01:48:10.405 --> 01:48:14.046]  Never mind my allegations against the Obama administration.
[01:48:14.266 --> 01:48:16.286]  This is proof from a federal prosecutor.
[01:48:16.626 --> 01:48:29.268]  This should be on the front page, top of the fold, of the same Washington Post that brought Richard Nixon down, and the same New York Times that claims it's the standard in American journalism.
[01:48:30.208 --> 01:48:31.589]  But you haven't heard a peep about them.
[01:48:31.609 --> 01:48:37.870]  You haven't heard it on CNN or MSNBC or CNBC or any of the networks.
[01:48:39.397 --> 01:48:43.060]  Think and hope that by ignoring this, it will go away.
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:48.824]  Now, it could go away if Michael Sussman pleads guilty.
[01:48:48.964 --> 01:48:55.930]  That's the lawyer accused of lying to the FBI, who was a lawyer for Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[01:48:56.590 --> 01:49:00.913]  Because he pleaded not guilty and there will be a trial, this stuff will come out at the trial.
[01:49:01.354 --> 01:49:04.176]  Now, I gotta say a word about the crime that Sussman's charged with.
[01:49:04.796 --> 01:49:07.819]  I don't believe it should be a crime to lie to the FBI.
[01:49:07.979 --> 01:49:08.239]  Why?
[01:49:09.099 --> 01:49:12.341]  Because the Supreme Court has said the FBI can lie to you.
[01:49:12.822 --> 01:49:15.824]  Well, if the FBI can lie to you, you should be able to lie to them.
[01:49:15.864 --> 01:49:17.525]  They're not morally superior to you.
[01:49:17.926 --> 01:49:19.026]  But I am wrong.
[01:49:19.407 --> 01:49:20.487]  The law is what it is.
[01:49:20.587 --> 01:49:26.892]   If you lie to the FBI in an official inquiry, You can be indicted and prosecuted.
[01:49:27.212 --> 01:49:28.453]  That's what happened to Sussman.
[01:49:28.513 --> 01:49:30.315]  And Judge, let me interrupt because I'm always interested about this.
[01:49:30.335 --> 01:49:31.816]  That's why I won't talk to the FBI.
[01:49:31.836 --> 01:49:33.097]  I won't talk to the Jan 6 Committee.
[01:49:33.477 --> 01:49:34.718]  It's not that I'm gonna lie.
[01:49:34.778 --> 01:49:36.739]  It's that they're gonna say I'm a liar and indict me.
[01:49:37.020 --> 01:49:38.541]  So it's not just that you can't lie to them.
[01:49:38.581 --> 01:49:41.963]  They then say you're lying and play little split hairs games.
[01:49:42.304 --> 01:49:45.166]  When did that become the law that you can't lie to the FBI?
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:52.091]  Oh, I don't know, but it's been the law for a long time, and the FBI will use it to the hilt.
[01:49:52.352 --> 01:49:54.416]  Here's a, you know, in the Martha Stewart case.
[01:49:55.140 --> 01:49:59.521]  In the same conversation in which she lied to them, they lied to her.
[01:49:59.861 --> 01:50:02.242]  The FBI agent who lied to her got a promotion.
[01:50:02.742 --> 01:50:03.602]  She went to jail.
[01:50:03.642 --> 01:50:04.643]  She was convicted of lying.
[01:50:04.883 --> 01:50:06.623]  This is considered a low-level crime.
[01:50:07.244 --> 01:50:09.524]  The maximum penalty is just a year in jail.
[01:50:09.724 --> 01:50:14.045]  To a lawyer, it's devastating because you'll lose your license to practice.
[01:50:14.826 --> 01:50:18.467]  But the committee that you talk about sought you.
[01:50:19.107 --> 01:50:22.468]  In the Sussman case, he sought the FBI.
[01:50:23.416 --> 01:50:25.559]  He knocked on the door and said, I have to come to you.
[01:50:25.639 --> 01:50:31.586]  I have devastating information about this guy, Donald Trump, and his connections to Russia.
[01:50:32.066 --> 01:50:34.669]  Question, are you representing the Hillary Clinton campaign?
[01:50:34.910 --> 01:50:35.771]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[01:50:35.851 --> 01:50:37.813]  I have this from independent sources.
[01:50:38.314 --> 01:50:39.775]  That's the alleged lie.
[01:50:41.037 --> 01:50:43.600]  He instigated the conversation himself.
[01:50:44.229 --> 01:50:52.432]  During which it is alleged that he lied, and he had the conversation with his now former friend, Peter Baker, who was the General Counsel of the FBI.
[01:50:52.712 --> 01:50:59.875]  Normally, you don't get to talk to the General Counsel about this evidence, but when you're a high-ranking, big-shot Washington, D.C.
[01:50:59.915 --> 01:51:05.858]  lawyer, and the General Counsel is your friend, and you want to feed him some nonsense, that's the guy you go to.
[01:51:06.718 --> 01:51:07.058]  Wow.
[01:51:07.078 --> 01:51:08.399]  We're going to go to break and come back.
[01:51:08.439 --> 01:51:09.479]  This is just riveting.
[01:51:09.519 --> 01:51:18.177]   Judge Andrew Napolitano, I know you want to make this about yourself, but just in 50 seconds here, I mean, how did you know all this stuff?
[01:51:18.197 --> 01:51:18.997]  I guess sources?
[01:51:19.017 --> 01:51:20.057]  Because you've been proven right?
[01:51:22.218 --> 01:51:23.458]  Well, yes, I had sources.
[01:51:23.638 --> 01:51:27.979]  One of my sources outed himself in the New York Times, one for his jugular.
[01:51:28.039 --> 01:51:32.720]  But something of this magnitude, you have to verify it to three levels.
[01:51:32.820 --> 01:51:42.963]  So in addition to the source who outed himself, I had two other sources who were able to verify what I said before I said it.
[01:51:43.900 --> 01:51:46.101]  Wow, Judge Andrew Napolitano is with us.
[01:51:46.121 --> 01:51:48.481]  You've got to bookmark his site and watch his show.
[01:51:49.381 --> 01:51:51.222]  I watch it all the time, JudgeNap.com.
[01:51:51.702 --> 01:51:54.763]  And man, I just thought of him instantly this weekend when this all broke.
[01:51:54.823 --> 01:51:56.283]  I was like, oh my gosh.
[01:51:57.423 --> 01:52:00.244]  Because I mean, he was one of the top guys at Fox.
[01:52:00.284 --> 01:52:02.965]  As soon as he covered this, bloop, they phased his ass out.
[01:52:03.365 --> 01:52:05.225]  And that's what people pay for, to tell the truth.
[01:52:05.245 --> 01:52:05.785]  We'll be right back.
[01:52:05.825 --> 01:52:06.385]  He's a hero.
[01:52:07.926 --> 01:52:13.067]  Well, completely vindicated, the capital V, Judge Andrew Napolitano joins us.
[01:52:14.542 --> 01:52:27.510]  The minute in 2017 he covered illegal spying against the Trump campaign and President Trump from his sources, they suspended him and then basically pulled him off TV until he was finally let go.
[01:52:27.530 --> 01:52:29.512]  And that was the reason for that.
[01:52:29.532 --> 01:52:30.392]  We could all see it.
[01:52:31.093 --> 01:52:31.933]  And he's a tough guy.
[01:52:31.953 --> 01:52:32.814]  He's not whining about it.
[01:52:32.834 --> 01:52:35.175]  He wants to just talk about the current news and how big this is.
[01:52:36.436 --> 01:52:42.093]   But wow, Clinton campaign paid to infiltrate Judge Uh, Napolitano broke all this.
[01:52:42.413 --> 01:52:44.814]  Again, Trump campaign paid to infiltrate Trump Tower.
[01:52:46.194 --> 01:52:48.535]  White House servers to link Trump to Russia.
[01:52:49.055 --> 01:52:49.855]  Durham fines.
[01:52:50.255 --> 01:52:51.215]  And he's got the evidence.
[01:52:51.936 --> 01:52:53.416]  And he's indicted the Clinton lawyer.
[01:52:54.396 --> 01:52:56.476]  And we know all this went on.
[01:52:56.837 --> 01:52:58.277]  And as you said, they outed themselves.
[01:52:58.677 --> 01:53:01.978]  They had a New York Times article on January 20, 2017.
[01:53:04.031 --> 01:53:08.272]  Where they bragged that they had wiretapped Trump and claimed that was the evidence he was a Russian.
[01:53:08.512 --> 01:53:09.452]  But there was no evidence.
[01:53:09.472 --> 01:53:10.672]  So that was the first outing.
[01:53:11.172 --> 01:53:14.373]  Then Napolitano dug into it and found out more.
[01:53:14.413 --> 01:53:26.835]  So I could ask a thousand questions, Judge, but in the 25 minutes we've got left, I'd like to just give you the floor, just the run of this show as the guy that tried to stop this deep state coup against America on what's currently happening.
[01:53:26.855 --> 01:53:29.095]  How do you think they're going to respond back to this?
[01:53:29.175 --> 01:53:29.915]  What is Hillary?
[01:53:30.255 --> 01:53:31.196]  What does Obama do?
[01:53:31.236 --> 01:53:32.856]  Because what do you call this?
[01:53:32.876 --> 01:53:33.696]  That's my first question.
[01:53:34.096 --> 01:53:46.362]  You know, that's a good question.
[01:53:46.682 --> 01:53:52.525]  Somebody who's good at this stuff will put a handle on it, and that handle will last.
[01:53:53.085 --> 01:53:58.768]  But the law will call this a conspiracy, an agreement to break laws.
[01:53:58.948 --> 01:54:01.689]  And that's really the danger to Mrs. Clinton.
[01:54:02.829 --> 01:54:15.055]  Because if this conspiracy continued on into 2017, probably up to the time that President Trump fired Jim Comey, which is May of 17.
[01:54:15.715 --> 01:54:18.357]  Well, that's fewer than five years ago.
[01:54:18.957 --> 01:54:21.138]  Five years is the statute of limitations.
[01:54:22.159 --> 01:54:25.780]  So the statute begins to run when the crime is committed.
[01:54:25.820 --> 01:54:28.882]  If you pull a trigger and kill somebody, that's when the crime is committed.
[01:54:29.774 --> 01:54:36.355]  But if it takes that person two or three months to die, the statute of limitations doesn't start to run until they die.
[01:54:36.955 --> 01:55:01.271]   If you have a conspiracy to interfere with a valid election of a president of the United States, I'm talking about the election of Donald Trump in 2016, and that conspiracy continues into 2017, even after he's the president, well, that is Fewer than five years ago, because the statute of limitations is five years.
[01:55:02.132 --> 01:55:09.075]  So those who are breathing a sigh of relief probably have more to worry about than they think they do.
[01:55:09.255 --> 01:55:25.449]   When John Ratcliffe, the former congressman from Texas and former director of national intelligence under Donald Trump, told my former colleagues at Fox News just this past weekend, That there may be some indictments coming.
[01:55:25.509 --> 01:55:26.851]  I'm pretty sure that's Ratcliffe.
[01:55:27.692 --> 01:55:30.817]  I'm pretty sure that's what he was talking about.
[01:55:31.378 --> 01:55:48.177]   So if Mrs. Clinton and Jake Sullivan and John Brennan and Jim Comey entered into an agreement in the fall of 2016, and that agreement carried into the presidency of Donald Trump until Comey was fired in May of 2017.
[01:55:49.878 --> 01:55:53.359]  Well, May of 2017 is fewer than five years ago.
[01:55:54.079 --> 01:55:59.661]  So Durham then has time to present all of this to a grand jury and ask them to indict.
[01:56:00.101 --> 01:56:12.749]   On the other hand, if the conspiracy ended at the election of Donald Trump, In November of 16, well then, those who want to see these characters prosecuted are out of luck.
[01:56:13.209 --> 01:56:23.212]  But what Durham is saying as this continued on into the White House, and if you look at this, and the things they said and did, I mean, I think that's where Durham's going.
[01:56:23.232 --> 01:56:23.992]  What do you think's happening?
[01:56:24.912 --> 01:56:26.753]  I think that's where he's going as well.
[01:56:27.813 --> 01:56:33.415]  And he very well may be targeting the former president, Barack Obama.
[01:56:34.042 --> 01:57:10.100]   I mean, if Barack Obama convened a group of people, if he convened a group of people in the Oval Office, which included Jack Brennan, whom you see there, then the head of the CIA, Jim Comey, the head of the FBI, Mrs. Clinton, Joe Biden, Jake Sullivan, and himself, and they agreed To use the assets of the federal government to spy on and thus undermine the President-elect, who was about to become the President of the United States, then we have a very, very serious problem on our hands.
[01:57:10.140 --> 01:57:12.421]  Now, let me suggest this to you.
[01:57:13.182 --> 01:57:29.150]   We know the spying was going on, at least up until the time of the inauguration, because two days after the inauguration is the FBI's infamous visit To General Flynn in his office in the White House.
[01:57:29.970 --> 01:57:42.412]  And they were able to ask him questions and get him to contradict what they knew he had said on the phone to the Russian ambassador just a week or so before.
[01:57:43.292 --> 01:57:53.934]  So were they spying on the Russian ambassador or spying on General Flynn after he was announced he was going to be the chief, the national security advisor to President, then President-elect Trump?
[01:57:54.254 --> 01:57:55.454]  Or were they spying on both?
[01:57:58.601 --> 01:58:04.705]  I know you don't like to speculate, but just as a guy that's been around the block a few times, gut level, where do you think this goes?
[01:58:05.146 --> 01:58:06.246]  Who do you think is most concerned?
[01:58:06.266 --> 01:58:09.789]  Because I remember things like Jim Comey testifying to Congress.
[01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:11.770]  I never talked to the press.
[01:58:12.190 --> 01:58:13.271]  I'm not involved in leaking.
[01:58:13.311 --> 01:58:17.654]  And later, well, I did call the head of a major university so he could tell the press.
[01:58:18.034 --> 01:58:18.975]  Well, that's the same thing.
[01:58:19.035 --> 01:58:19.896]  I'm a mafia boss.
[01:58:20.396 --> 01:58:23.997]  And I tell my underling to go have somebody killed, I'm just as guilty.
[01:58:24.017 --> 01:58:28.659]  So I don't get how Comey tells Congress, I never leaked, I just leaked through somebody else.
[01:58:28.679 --> 01:58:29.439]  That doesn't make sense.
[01:58:31.960 --> 01:58:42.104]  Well, look, John Durham would have been unwise to have filed the document that he did last Friday, laying all this out.
[01:58:42.404 --> 01:58:45.265]  A, if he couldn't prove it, and B, if he wasn't prepared to prove it.
[01:58:45.868 --> 01:58:54.859]  Because he doesn't really need to go through this just to prove that this fellow Michael Sussman told a lie to the then General Counsel of the FBI.
[01:58:55.079 --> 01:59:01.847]  You know, there's one thing about prosecutors, and this is good and bad, they always like to prove their worth.
[01:59:01.867 --> 01:59:12.766]   I mean, it is the rare prosecutor That spends a fortune, that's Durham, that spends a fortune in government money to investigate, and then doesn't indict.
[01:59:13.286 --> 01:59:17.167]  Because then he's got to justify, what the hell did you spend all that money on?
[01:59:17.187 --> 01:59:26.569]  So you're saying they have their case, just like a mafia case, they're going after the Clinton lawyer, and then to Clinton, and then to Obama, Brennan, all the deep state players.
[01:59:27.649 --> 01:59:31.430]  I think there's a rational argument to support that, Alex.
[01:59:31.450 --> 01:59:32.610]  You said it better than I could.
[01:59:33.891 --> 01:59:42.478]  Look, just in those days when I made these allegations about the Brits spying on Trump, well, there's Jim Clapper in the middle.
[01:59:42.958 --> 01:59:56.769]  Now he skated, he lied under oath when he was asked by a liberal Democratic Senator Wyden from Oregon, does the government spy on Americans?
[01:59:56.949 --> 01:59:57.669]  And he said, no.
[01:59:58.632 --> 02:00:07.654]  And then he said, not wittingly, and then about a month or so later he, in a letter, apologized and admitted he had lied under oath and they decided not to prosecute him.
[02:00:08.014 --> 02:00:18.117]  That event was well more than five years ago, but that was public perjury over information that we all knew he was lying about.
[02:00:18.177 --> 02:00:21.458]  The questioner, Senator Wyden, knew he was lying about it.
[02:00:21.498 --> 02:00:24.778]  Anybody that followed Edward Snowden knew that he was lying about it.
[02:00:25.279 --> 02:00:31.014]   But here's what I was saying before your Producers put up the photograph of Jim Clapper.
[02:00:33.216 --> 02:00:42.842]  The concept that prosecutors need to justify their worth is well known in the legal community.
[02:00:43.202 --> 02:00:46.004]  Durham is a lifelong prosecutor.
[02:00:46.444 --> 02:00:51.267]  I don't think he would have put that stuff out there last Friday if he didn't intend to demonstrate it.
[02:00:52.468 --> 02:01:02.451]   And if Sussman pleads guilty, Then Durham's only forum in which to demonstrate this will be a trial against somebody else whom he has yet to indict.
[02:01:03.467 --> 02:01:13.636]  And the whole question is statute of limitations, but if you get into ongoing, you know they were spying after that, that will lead to the later spying during the four years of Trump, and then now it's a bunch of other investigations.
[02:01:14.016 --> 02:01:18.660]  Judge Andrew Napolitano is on fire, and is the Phoenix vindicated?
[02:01:18.700 --> 02:01:19.801]  I mean, wow!
[02:01:19.821 --> 02:01:24.965]  I remember when he came out and said they were spying on Trump with evidence, I said, that guy's not going to be on air very long, and he wasn't.
[02:01:25.265 --> 02:01:29.549]  But he is still on air, and regrowing his show, and we really support him and appreciate him.
[02:01:29.729 --> 02:01:30.650]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[02:01:32.915 --> 02:01:37.641]  Well, you know, I admire people that are male, female, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young.
[02:01:37.661 --> 02:01:38.301]  But you know who they are?
[02:01:38.942 --> 02:01:40.003]  They're the trailblazers.
[02:01:40.044 --> 02:01:40.824]  They're the mavericks.
[02:01:40.844 --> 02:01:50.236]  They're the people that time and time again I watch it and listen to or observe in life who are being truthful, that are being honest, and that really know what they're talking about.
[02:01:50.316 --> 02:01:51.177]  That's who I admire.
[02:01:51.946 --> 02:01:53.628]  More and more, though, the corporate media is dying.
[02:01:54.129 --> 02:01:58.814]  Even Fox's ratings are down, but nothing compared to CNN, with 100,000 viewers on average, MSNBC.
[02:01:59.375 --> 02:02:01.017]  Because people know that's not genuine.
[02:02:01.337 --> 02:02:07.204]  It's okay if we make mistakes sometimes, but the people know we're trying to tell them the truth because we respect them.
[02:02:08.105 --> 02:02:09.366]  Because we respect ourselves.
[02:02:10.047 --> 02:02:15.714]   And Judge Andrew Napolitano Got phased out because that was the move he made.
[02:02:16.354 --> 02:02:18.896]  Telling the truth when everybody else knew Trump was being spied on.
[02:02:19.217 --> 02:02:20.758]  They bragged they were spying on him.
[02:02:20.818 --> 02:02:21.639]  Oh, we know he's a Russian.
[02:02:21.659 --> 02:02:22.339]  We're spying on him.
[02:02:22.359 --> 02:02:23.801]  Napolitano's like, boom, I gotcha.
[02:02:25.556 --> 02:02:28.356]  goes and looks it up, goes after him, they come after him.
[02:02:28.356 --> 02:02:33.336]   So people want men and women to do the right things, but then when we do the right things,
[02:02:33.336 --> 02:02:38.516]   some people don't back us. So I know you don't want to talk about yourself all day, Judge Napolitano,
[02:02:38.516 --> 02:02:43.595]   but any other points about the Durham investigation, how big this is, other key angles? And then
[02:02:43.595 --> 02:02:48.067]   I just want to ask you in closing, in the 10 minutes we have left or nine minutes we have left,
[02:02:48.067 --> 02:02:53.636]   just in general, your view on vaccine mandates and open borders and Biden's low approval rating
[02:02:53.636 --> 02:02:58.815]   and just any other, I mean, because I could talk to you for 10 hours about things happening in the
[02:02:58.815 --> 02:03:03.315]   world and just your view of where humanity is right now, Judge.
[02:03:03.538 --> 02:03:19.279]   Well, Alex, you know, you and I have been friends for years and I have admired your work for years, and you also have suffered At the hands of people who press buttons in the world because you've not hesitated to tell the truth.
[02:03:19.859 --> 02:03:26.780]  And I think the overwhelming majority of the people watching and listening to us now would agree with what I just said about you.
[02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:29.981]  You are a hero to many, many, many people.
[02:03:30.061 --> 02:03:31.922]  Your ratings are astronomical.
[02:03:32.362 --> 02:03:38.643]  And that's because you always say what you believe to be the truth and you have the means with which to back it up.
[02:03:39.318 --> 02:03:49.665]  You know, other than what I said about knowing the prosecutorial mindset and knowing that John Durham has that mindset, he needs to justify himself.
[02:03:49.745 --> 02:04:04.715]  I really don't think he's going to stop at the indictment of Michael Sussman, Hillary Clinton's former campaign lawyer, for what's considered a low-level crime, because the punishment is often not even incarceration.
[02:04:06.098 --> 02:04:07.458]  Lying to the FBI.
[02:04:07.518 --> 02:04:17.781]  If you lie to the FBI and send them on a wild goose chase and they spent a fortune chasing down your lie, well then they're going to come after you very aggressively.
[02:04:18.081 --> 02:04:24.942]  But if the FBI knows at the moment you lied to them that it was a lie, then they're not going to come after you aggressively.
[02:04:25.822 --> 02:04:27.743]  Unless they have nothing else to come after you for.
[02:04:28.303 --> 02:04:32.704]  So during the Reagan administration, there's a famous arrest on a Brooklyn street corner.
[02:04:33.624 --> 02:04:42.607]  Uh, in the years and the days when we used to have phone booths, uh, the FBI had cornered a major Colombian drug dealer, uh, but they had no evidence.
[02:04:42.667 --> 02:04:46.188]  They knew in their hearts who he was, but they had no evidence with which to arrest him.
[02:04:46.548 --> 02:04:50.649]  He got out of the phone booth and an FBI agent went up to him and said, Hey buddy, what's your name?
[02:04:51.069 --> 02:04:53.230]  And he said, Nancy Reagan.
[02:04:54.430 --> 02:04:56.171]  And they arrested him for lying to the FBI.
[02:04:58.154 --> 02:05:03.480]  That led to the acquisition of evidence against him and a prosecution and a lifetime sentence.
[02:05:04.040 --> 02:05:11.068]  But without some hook on which to hang their hats, which came out of his own mouth, they wouldn't have been able to do it.
[02:05:11.128 --> 02:05:22.901]   On the other hand, if they want to frame you, as you know they can and have done, as they did to Martha Stewart, as they would try to do to you, Uh, then your best bet is not to talk to them.
[02:05:23.501 --> 02:05:26.622]  Okay, I'm glad you raised that, because that's a question I meant to ask you and I'd forgotten.
[02:05:26.942 --> 02:05:28.122]  What do you make of January 6th?
[02:05:28.222 --> 02:05:29.082]  I've been subpoenaed.
[02:05:29.883 --> 02:05:32.243]  We offered them, hey, you want my emails, want all my text messages?
[02:05:32.503 --> 02:05:39.665]  I'll give you written statement answers, but I'm not going to have you twist this into a perjury trap, and they just didn't do that, so now they may give me immunity.
[02:05:40.005 --> 02:05:41.006]  I don't even know anything.
[02:05:41.046 --> 02:05:43.686]  I wasn't, I mean, we tried to have peaceful demonstrations.
[02:05:43.746 --> 02:05:45.247]  What do you make of this January 6th?
[02:05:46.287 --> 02:05:58.677]  And now they've got the new terrorism directive by the president saying questioning elections or questioning lockdowns is terror, and then Trudeau's declared a civil emergency, and they're going to grab bank accounts without court orders.
[02:05:59.017 --> 02:06:01.099]  What do you make of this climate?
[02:06:02.860 --> 02:06:04.582]  Well, the climate is reprehensible.
[02:06:04.682 --> 02:06:07.724]  It's totalitarianism on steroids.
[02:06:08.265 --> 02:06:17.963]   You and our mutual friend and colleague, in my case, a boyhood friend, Roger Stone, Did the right thing when the committee summons you.
[02:06:18.023 --> 02:06:24.225]  Don't play footsie with them the way Mark Meadows was a decent, decent human being.
[02:06:24.285 --> 02:06:26.765]  I've known Mark since his early days in Congress.
[02:06:27.186 --> 02:06:28.326]  Don't play footsie with them.
[02:06:28.346 --> 02:06:33.527]  Don't give them some things and then decide to throw up your hands if you don't like the questions they're answering you.
[02:06:33.808 --> 02:06:38.029]  Don't answer a single question except who you are and how they can reach you.
[02:06:38.069 --> 02:06:41.150]  That's the way you and Roger Stone dealt with it.
[02:06:41.650 --> 02:06:44.851]  In terms of Trudeau, he's just as bad as his father.
[02:06:46.584 --> 02:06:48.225]  There's no national emergency.
[02:06:48.305 --> 02:07:01.172]  The statute itself defines national emergency as one where the government is unable to protect the security and freedom of Canada, not one in which the roads are clogged.
[02:07:02.133 --> 02:07:14.240]  But that statute, which he has triggered, gives him tremendous power, as you say, to arrest without warrant or evidence and without preferring charges against the people arrested.
[02:07:14.644 --> 02:07:21.244]   to confiscate bank accounts, to confiscate trucks, to confiscate insurance policies on
[02:07:21.244 --> 02:07:26.224]   the trucks, which of course is insane, because then you've got a 16-wheeler on the highway
[02:07:26.224 --> 02:07:27.524]  without insurance on it.
[02:07:27.524 --> 02:07:31.483]  So he's just reprehensible.
[02:07:31.483 --> 02:07:36.523]   In terms of the vaccines, I've been campaigning against them for a long time.
[02:07:36.474 --> 02:07:38.135]  It's not a vaccine, as you have said.
[02:07:38.735 --> 02:07:42.678]  A vaccine gives you a small dose of the disease.
[02:07:42.718 --> 02:07:43.838]  Your body fights it off.
[02:07:44.219 --> 02:07:46.580]  You have the immunity and the antibodies forever.
[02:07:46.940 --> 02:07:52.984]  This is a chemical cocktail, which is an experiment at lessening the effects of the disease.
[02:07:53.344 --> 02:07:54.845]  It doesn't prevent you from getting it.
[02:07:54.905 --> 02:07:57.827]  It doesn't prevent you from transmitting it.
[02:07:58.427 --> 02:08:02.409]  The Supreme Court has ruled several times, you control your own body.
[02:08:02.829 --> 02:08:04.590]  You decide what goes into it.
[02:08:04.971 --> 02:08:15.776]  The government of the United States of America signed a treaty called the Nuremberg Protocols, which prohibit the use of government compulsion to take experimental chemicals into the body.
[02:08:16.257 --> 02:08:27.943]  So we are on very solid ground legally and morally, but big government, big pharma, and big medicine have persuaded the public that they are right.
[02:08:28.536 --> 02:08:29.257]  And we are wrong.
[02:08:29.317 --> 02:08:31.459]  So again, it takes courage.
[02:08:32.039 --> 02:08:35.262]  The truck drivers in Canada have to be courageous.
[02:08:35.783 --> 02:08:38.845]  People like you need to be courageous.
[02:08:39.686 --> 02:08:47.173]  People listening to us now need to recognize that they decide what goes in their bodies, not Dr. Fauci and not the government.
[02:08:47.253 --> 02:08:47.873]  Beautifully said.
[02:08:47.933 --> 02:08:50.214]  I see your clips on YouTube, watch them all the time.
[02:08:50.234 --> 02:08:56.515]  I've also tuned into your amazing podcast because you're not just, you know, handicapped by 10 minutes a day on Fox, on a few shows.
[02:08:56.835 --> 02:08:58.155]  You can really get into deep thought.
[02:08:58.175 --> 02:08:58.715]  It's amazing.
[02:08:59.075 --> 02:08:59.956]  Judging Freedom.
[02:08:59.996 --> 02:09:03.076]  Everybody should search that on the different platforms and follow it.
[02:09:03.556 --> 02:09:04.477]  JudgeNap.com.
[02:09:04.497 --> 02:09:05.497]  You can find it all there as well.
[02:09:05.557 --> 02:09:07.937]  Judging Freedom available on YouTube.
[02:09:07.977 --> 02:09:09.278]  Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[02:09:09.658 --> 02:09:10.778]  Judge, thank you so much.
[02:09:11.823 --> 02:09:17.985]  For the time, and again, I know you've been through a lot for telling the truth, and I just appreciate you for myself, my crew, and my family.
[02:09:18.265 --> 02:09:19.626]  Thank you so much for being a great American.
[02:09:20.546 --> 02:09:21.206]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:09:21.266 --> 02:09:21.926]  It's a pleasure.
[02:09:21.966 --> 02:09:23.487]  Anytime, I'm available for you.
[02:09:23.647 --> 02:09:24.267]  God bless you.
[02:09:24.567 --> 02:09:25.047]  God bless you.
[02:09:25.107 --> 02:09:25.428]  Thank you.
[02:09:26.168 --> 02:09:28.088]  Wow, that's a real American right there, folks.
[02:09:28.108 --> 02:09:29.029]  That's the real deal.
[02:09:29.069 --> 02:09:32.050]  He didn't back down when the attacks were going on.
[02:09:32.070 --> 02:09:34.150]  He was put through hell, and now he's been vindicated.
[02:09:34.211 --> 02:09:34.451]  Wow.
[02:09:35.511 --> 02:09:41.433]  Look, I got the whole next hour to do, and I got a bunch of clips I haven't got to, and I said I'd take calls today, and I haven't done that yet.
[02:09:42.978 --> 02:09:51.586]  That's why I'm going to start the nighttime show, three hours, a couple nights a week, with no commercials, so I can just take call after call after call after call, because the calls are my favorite thing.
[02:09:51.966 --> 02:09:53.487]  But it makes me mad with the breaks and everything.
[02:09:53.507 --> 02:09:54.428]  And I'm not mad at our stations.
[02:09:54.889 --> 02:09:59.853]  We would have been de-platformed and off the air when they shut us down on Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and everywhere else.
[02:10:00.994 --> 02:10:08.280]  Roku, the list went on and on, if it wasn't for our now 300 plus AM and FM affiliates and Global Shortwave and satellite and TV stations.
[02:10:12.410 --> 02:10:15.071]  I get driven crazy by 15 minutes or 14 minutes of ads an hour.
[02:10:15.131 --> 02:10:18.192]  So I'm going to keep doing this show and I'm going to start.
[02:10:19.372 --> 02:10:20.012]  I've already started it.
[02:10:20.032 --> 02:10:25.894]  You see me almost every Saturday doing a two, three hour commercial free show and you see the other things we're doing.
[02:10:26.434 --> 02:10:27.835]  We're just fighting as hard as we can, folks.
[02:10:27.895 --> 02:10:36.978]  I mean, believe me, I'm pretty tired sometimes, but every time I think about these globalists and how damn evil they are and then I'm just going to give up and then they're going to have their way with everybody.
[02:10:37.158 --> 02:10:39.879]  No, no, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going 110% here.
[02:10:41.747 --> 02:10:44.911]  And all I'm asking for is your word of mouth, your prayer, and your financial support.
[02:10:46.332 --> 02:10:49.295]  And you've got somebody that will not let you down if you don't let me down.

[02:10:51.438 --> 02:10:52.339]  It ends on Wednesday.

[02:10:56.644 --> 02:10:57.425]  You cannot beat the deal.

[02:11:00.470 --> 02:11:04.393]  Infowarsstore.com, preparewithalex.com, and we've got X3.

[02:11:29.045 --> 02:11:33.126]  It's all there at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:11:33.486 --> 02:11:34.587]  In the arena.
[02:11:34.967 --> 02:11:35.507]  In the fight.
[02:11:35.847 --> 02:11:36.587]  With the Globalist.
[02:11:36.747 --> 02:11:37.507]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:11:37.628 --> 02:11:39.628]  Hour number four, straight ahead.
[02:11:39.628 --> 02:11:42.108]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:11:42.108 --> 02:11:50.348]  Sold out for months, X3 is now back in stock.
[02:11:49.947 --> 02:11:54.049]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game-changing, our products are game-changing.
[02:11:54.129 --> 02:11:57.410]  And so many people are deficient in iodine.
[02:11:57.450 --> 02:11:58.710]  It's not in the soil anymore.
[02:11:59.331 --> 02:12:00.871]  Most of it in the ocean is contaminated.
[02:12:01.351 --> 02:12:11.836]   But when you get high-quality tri-iodine, all three of the healthy types together, It does amazing things for your stamina, your libido, but most importantly, your immune system.

[02:13:00.228 --> 02:13:04.651]  We've had some amazing guests on, and we're just getting started.
[02:13:06.772 --> 02:13:13.917]  You know, this last Friday, I saw it in my box, in my little, you know, email box, and I didn't watch it because I was too busy.
[02:13:14.938 --> 02:13:19.681]  And then I watched it Saturday morning, and it made me physically sick.
[02:13:20.802 --> 02:13:24.884]  Because when I watched it, tens of thousands of pieces of data came into my little brain.
[02:13:26.109 --> 02:13:31.452]  And I remembered all the leftist shows celebrating the euthanasia of Down Syndrome people.
[02:13:32.232 --> 02:13:32.592]  Humans.
[02:13:33.973 --> 02:13:38.395]  And, you know, if we kill the least of us, and I'm not saying the least of us, that's a Christ quote.
[02:13:39.436 --> 02:13:40.536]  We see it as the least of us.
[02:13:40.556 --> 02:13:41.637]  They've done that to Christ.
[02:13:43.238 --> 02:13:48.921]  And so we're going to air that coming up in the last segment of this hour.
[02:13:50.982 --> 02:13:51.842]  And I mean, I checked it.
[02:13:51.882 --> 02:13:52.302]  It's got like 100,000 views.
[02:13:54.272 --> 02:13:56.653]  A few days ago, can we look it up and see what it has now?
[02:13:56.673 --> 02:13:58.233]  The damn thing needs 50 million views.
[02:13:59.393 --> 02:14:05.434]  And I'm not bitching at anybody that doesn't have 50 million views, I'm just saying, they're euthanizing Down Syndrome humans.
[02:14:07.135 --> 02:14:09.195]  You feel safe at night knowing they're doing that, right?
[02:14:09.875 --> 02:14:12.176]  I sure as hell don't.
[02:14:12.196 --> 02:14:13.016]  Yeah, 183,000 views now.
[02:14:13.996 --> 02:14:17.777]  They literally put her on a bioethics chart, because you know what's worse than being white, right?
[02:14:19.028 --> 02:14:23.432]  In the official bioethics boards of a lot, I don't know how many, but it's a lot of them.
[02:14:23.732 --> 02:14:25.753]  I don't have the statistics because they're not out.
[02:14:26.134 --> 02:14:34.981]  A lot of your big hospital groups do not give medical care to white people now, whether it's monoclonal antibodies, you name it.
[02:14:35.641 --> 02:14:40.825]  And they say right there, I've heard Dutch TV, British TV, they're like, hey, you're a Down syndrome man.
[02:14:40.945 --> 02:14:41.846]  Yeah, I am.
[02:14:42.186 --> 02:14:45.129]  You know, you cost five times more in the welfare on average.
[02:14:46.092 --> 02:14:47.653]  Why the hell did you leftists create welfare?
[02:14:47.673 --> 02:14:51.837]  To get rid of families, so you could then say, let's cut people off, because we're collectivist.
[02:14:52.397 --> 02:14:54.419]  Oh, you're a conservative, you don't get heart surgery.
[02:14:54.779 --> 02:14:56.220]  Oh, you didn't take a vaccine.
[02:14:56.561 --> 02:14:57.782]  You don't get a kidney.
[02:14:57.822 --> 02:14:59.923]  You don't get... No, we know what you're doing!
[02:15:00.584 --> 02:15:03.827]  You're getting us dependent on you, so you can cut stuff off, we know!
[02:15:04.767 --> 02:15:09.371]  That makes you leftists feel real good, to kill a Down Syndrome person.
[02:15:12.113 --> 02:15:13.995]  On record, I'm sorry, she's Down Syndrome.
[02:15:15.379 --> 02:15:16.440]  She ain't getting medical care.
[02:15:16.500 --> 02:15:18.362]  We need to get rid of this lady.
[02:15:18.422 --> 02:15:24.487]  And that's what Bayer Pharmaceutical, 14 years ago, they settled the cases and the documents were put out.
[02:15:24.887 --> 02:15:28.471]  Part of the settlement, because the families didn't want a bunch of money, they wanted to stop.
[02:15:29.832 --> 02:15:31.393]  Unlike other people that sue everybody.
[02:15:32.875 --> 02:15:35.397]  And it was in France, it was in Australia and a couple other Canada.
[02:15:37.267 --> 02:15:41.749]  They firebombed the Hemophiliac Society for exposing it, but that didn't stop them, that didn't intimidate them.
[02:15:42.330 --> 02:15:55.156]  And they released the documents where in Australia and France, the executives were talking to each other and they said, well, we've infected millions of ampules of factor VIII with HIV and hepatitis, and it's going to be a death sentence for millions of people.
[02:15:55.816 --> 02:15:59.778]  And the head guy came back and said, there's too many hemophiliacs, let's get rid of them.
[02:16:00.198 --> 02:16:07.198]  They went, "Yeah, let's do it."
[02:16:07.198 --> 02:16:09.198]  Oh my God.
[02:16:09.686 --> 02:16:13.028]  So now, because you bleed too much, you get to die.
[02:16:13.348 --> 02:16:15.350]  Or because you got an extra chromosome, you get to die.
[02:16:17.151 --> 02:16:18.111]  Yeah, I got an idea.
[02:16:18.592 --> 02:16:20.913]  How about the people that want to kill everybody start dying?
[02:16:20.933 --> 02:16:23.775]  Because I don't need to kill people to feel powerful.
[02:16:23.995 --> 02:16:25.736]  I've already got all that genetics.
[02:16:26.077 --> 02:16:27.237]  I've already got all that handled.
[02:16:27.738 --> 02:16:29.259]  That's like low-level stuff I got.
[02:16:29.759 --> 02:16:30.499]  It's in the arsenal.
[02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:31.720]  It's sitting right there.
[02:16:31.760 --> 02:16:32.781]  It's the best you can get.
[02:16:33.487 --> 02:16:39.931]  The best at war, the best at killing, the best at operations, the best at everything that's low level.
[02:16:40.331 --> 02:16:41.232]  But you know what's harder?
[02:16:41.332 --> 02:16:46.134]  Growing crops, taking care of children, designing technology, stepping up for weak people.
[02:16:46.495 --> 02:16:47.335]  That's what's hard!
[02:16:49.556 --> 02:16:53.439]  Not all you people that think screwing over weak people, that's not strong.
[02:16:55.120 --> 02:16:57.101]  Now there's one thing I do before I'm dead.
[02:16:58.550 --> 02:17:03.171]  We are going to get you people that have done this to all these innocents, and you're going to pay hard for what you've done.
[02:17:03.971 --> 02:17:14.093]  I swear in front of God, on the altar of God, as Thomas Jefferson did, eternal resistance against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[02:17:15.933 --> 02:17:17.273]  I will come back and hit more news.
[02:17:17.913 --> 02:17:20.854]  There's so much to hit in T-minus 60 seconds.
[02:17:22.034 --> 02:17:23.914]  But every day we're on is a precious day.
[02:17:24.014 --> 02:17:25.995]  The enemy's getting ready to turn the power off next.
[02:17:26.355 --> 02:17:27.815]  Get ready for the fake cyber attack.
[02:17:29.216 --> 02:17:34.119]  All right, folks, I got some really big news to hit right now on this Tuesday emergency broadcast.
[02:17:35.940 --> 02:17:37.341]  It is so incredibly intense.
[02:17:38.162 --> 02:17:43.105]  You know, I didn't let the COVID news, even though that's central, get in the way of the big broadcast today.
[02:17:43.165 --> 02:17:44.226]  I hit all the other news.
[02:17:45.246 --> 02:17:49.129]  The martial law in Canada, which is a response of humans fighting the COVID tyranny.
[02:17:49.569 --> 02:17:52.791]  Russia pulling their troops back from the border and the media trying to spin that.
[02:17:52.811 --> 02:17:53.932]  The Durham investigation.
[02:17:55.692 --> 02:18:00.192]  and so much more, but wow.
[02:18:00.192 --> 02:18:06.733]   I mean, the news I'm seeing here is just beautiful human resistance
[02:18:06.733 --> 02:18:09.412]  to tyranny basically everywhere.
[02:18:09.412 --> 02:18:11.012]  (laughs)
[02:18:11.141 --> 02:18:11.941]  And that's a great thing.
[02:18:14.102 --> 02:18:19.844]  But we can sit here and fight tyranny all day until we realize something that's really important in my view.
[02:18:21.504 --> 02:18:28.486]  And that's that 90% of people serving evil actually believe those of us that are fighting them are the evil ones.
[02:18:32.600 --> 02:18:38.729]  And so I just want to reach out to those new listeners and people that are tuning in wanting to find out what this Alex Jones thing is about today.
[02:18:39.450 --> 02:18:41.252]  Just to listen to me really, really carefully.
[02:18:42.334 --> 02:18:47.761]  Most of you, I guess, didn't get a chance growing up to run into this information and didn't get the head start I did.
[02:18:48.062 --> 02:18:49.664]  But believe me, I know what I'm talking about.
[02:18:50.572 --> 02:18:55.954]  And believe me, all I want is good for you and good for me and good for us together into the future.
[02:18:56.454 --> 02:19:04.798]  And the people you're serving in the Democratic Party or the corporate systems worldwide are out to get you and are like robots.
[02:19:05.078 --> 02:19:09.540]  They don't have any empathy and they don't care about you and they don't want to empower the oppressed.
[02:19:09.940 --> 02:19:12.021]  They don't want to empower humanity because they're weak.
[02:19:14.362 --> 02:19:15.882]  It's hard to care about people.
[02:19:16.762 --> 02:19:17.863]  It's hard to be informed.
[02:19:19.238 --> 02:19:21.159]  But the lazy just join with evil.
[02:19:21.500 --> 02:19:24.161]  And I know a lot of average low-level people join with evil too.
[02:19:24.562 --> 02:19:29.325]  That's the big trick that the upper echelon of evil sells to the low-level echelons of evil.
[02:19:30.486 --> 02:19:31.306]  Go ahead and be corrupt.
[02:19:31.326 --> 02:19:31.927]  Go ahead and be evil.
[02:19:31.947 --> 02:19:32.547]  You'll get ahead.
[02:19:33.228 --> 02:19:34.268]  But you're not getting ahead.
[02:19:34.328 --> 02:19:39.892]  You are digging your grave and our collective graves deeper and deeper by the minute as you do that.
[02:19:43.630 --> 02:19:47.713]  I was sitting there as we came back from break looking for my COVID stack because it's like five inches thick.
[02:19:48.314 --> 02:19:49.015]  I don't know why.
[02:19:49.035 --> 02:19:52.738]  I don't know why I can't find it.
[02:19:52.758 --> 02:19:53.879]  It's just, it's just too much.
[02:19:54.779 --> 02:19:56.441]  But I do have the clips here at least.
[02:19:56.881 --> 02:20:02.005]  Look, there's only like 25 of these that are all insane.
[02:20:02.406 --> 02:20:03.166]  But here's a big one.
[02:20:04.327 --> 02:20:08.731]  I've seen this medical doctor on Australian national TV.
[02:20:11.277 --> 02:20:12.338]  But he sounds like he's British.
[02:20:12.378 --> 02:20:13.379]  He's got a British accent.
[02:20:13.399 --> 02:20:16.361]  He's a medical doctor and I've seen him for the last year and a half warning what was happening.
[02:20:17.522 --> 02:20:24.707]  But the point is, is that when I was sent this on Twitter this morning by a friend, I went there and it said, sorry, you can't see this.
[02:20:25.968 --> 02:20:28.049]  It's not just, oh, this is dangerous.
[02:20:28.089 --> 02:20:29.590]  Click here if you want to not go to it.
[02:20:29.630 --> 02:20:30.311]  Click here if you want to.
[02:20:30.331 --> 02:20:31.632]  It was, oh, this is dangerous.
[02:20:31.652 --> 02:20:32.172]  You can't see it.
[02:20:33.073 --> 02:20:37.496]  So then I searched what I saw in the headline and found another link.
[02:20:39.855 --> 02:20:43.277]  But it said, oh, you can't share this.
[02:20:43.457 --> 02:20:44.858]  This is disinformation.
[02:20:45.238 --> 02:20:47.800]  Like I'm a two-year-old and can't decide for myself what's true.
[02:20:47.840 --> 02:20:49.641]  In fact, I've got a screenshot of it right here.
[02:20:49.661 --> 02:20:50.081]  I'll pull it up.
[02:20:54.524 --> 02:20:56.805]  Now, of course, what did I do when this happened this morning?
[02:20:58.206 --> 02:20:58.807]  I got mad.
[02:21:00.047 --> 02:21:01.648]  And I sent it out to about 20 people I know.
[02:21:04.470 --> 02:21:06.231]  It passed all the dog and kid photos.
[02:21:06.251 --> 02:21:07.672]  I've got my phone here since this morning.
[02:21:07.692 --> 02:21:08.493]  I take so many photos.
[02:21:09.676 --> 02:21:13.479]  But yeah, overhead shot this for me.
[02:21:13.799 --> 02:21:18.682]  This is what it says on the one minute 53 second video.
[02:21:20.903 --> 02:21:22.104]  You can zoom in on that a little bit more.
[02:21:22.164 --> 02:21:27.388]  It says, learn why health officials consider COVID-19 vaccines safe for most people.
[02:21:28.509 --> 02:21:33.509]   And then it says, "This tweet cannot be replied to, shared or liked."
[02:21:33.509 --> 02:21:43.509]  Now, what's he calling for?
[02:21:43.774 --> 02:21:45.055]  He's calling for Nuremberg 2.
[02:21:46.916 --> 02:21:48.317]  So what did I do when they did that?
[02:21:48.577 --> 02:21:59.724]  I sent to the producers to grab the high-quality clip, and then I sat there on a group text to more than a hundred major talk show hosts I know, including Joe Rogan, and I sent them that link.
[02:22:00.604 --> 02:22:04.186]  Now, you could do that with your friends and family.
[02:22:04.627 --> 02:22:11.591]   That action, because I'm already seeing the effects, We'll be many times bigger than me talking about it today.
[02:22:12.012 --> 02:22:23.457]  And I just point that out that even though I've got a big show, and even though I've got this awesome audience of activists, it's the stuff I do in the dirt, at the point-blank range is what I call it, that has the biggest effect, just like you are.
[02:22:24.057 --> 02:22:30.039]  And I'm here to tell you, when I pat you on the head and say you're amazing, I'm not just saying that because you feel good about it.
[02:22:30.100 --> 02:22:31.160]  You are everything.
[02:22:31.560 --> 02:22:46.240]   When you decide to move, when you decide to take action, when you decide you're not laying down anymore, I can feel your strength, and it makes me stronger, and I make you stronger, and that is our communal spirit of liberty and freedom the Holy Spirit gave us.
[02:22:46.600 --> 02:22:47.881]  We're not just meant to commune with God.
[02:22:48.882 --> 02:22:54.766]  God is meant to direct us, energize us, and then we connect to others, and that forms the body of Christ.
[02:22:55.646 --> 02:22:56.267]  And it's strong!
[02:22:58.840 --> 02:23:12.169]  And it's got the future in its hand, and it's got the destiny of our children, and the will of who we are, and this satanic new world order telling us we're racist, and we're ugly, and we're bad, and we're genetically inferior, and we need Big Pharma to save us is a LIE!
[02:23:14.747 --> 02:23:20.549]  And it must be and it will be resisted by simply saying, no, I see through you.
[02:23:21.109 --> 02:23:24.490]  And I want to be persecuted by Google and Twitter and Facebook.
[02:23:24.810 --> 02:23:25.950]  I want to be lied about.
[02:23:26.290 --> 02:23:32.392]  I want to be attacked, not because it's fun, but because I know that I'm in the fight when I'm getting hit.
[02:23:34.152 --> 02:23:39.294]  If you're laying out on the beach, not a care in the world, counting all your little monies in the bank.
[02:23:40.649 --> 02:23:41.390]  Are you really happy?
[02:23:41.410 --> 02:23:42.251]  And the answer is no.
[02:23:42.551 --> 02:23:45.874]  Those people are all empty as hell, always chasing something that doesn't exist.
[02:23:46.114 --> 02:24:03.892]  But when you're in the arena, when you're in the fight, when you're in God's will, when you're following that journey, when you're in that river of God's consciousness, you are so empowered, and so enlightened, and so fulfilled, and so strong, it's embarrassing.
[02:24:08.166 --> 02:24:09.467]  Because you realize it's not you.
[02:24:09.587 --> 02:24:12.470]  It's millisecond by millisecond.
[02:24:12.490 --> 02:24:14.051]  They're like eons in God's mind.
[02:24:14.271 --> 02:24:18.054]  God just empowering every atom in your body, everything in your soul.
[02:24:18.315 --> 02:24:22.758]  You literally exist because God, millisecond to millisecond, is creating you in his mind.
[02:24:23.799 --> 02:24:24.640]  That's incredible.
[02:24:25.080 --> 02:24:27.002]  And that's what you want to be part of forever.
[02:24:27.923 --> 02:24:31.325]  Because God is not a God of slavery, but of free will.
[02:24:31.666 --> 02:24:35.389]  And if you reject that consciousness, God will spit you out.
[02:24:37.031 --> 02:24:44.882]  And the worst thing in eternity, the worst thing in existence in all dimensions, is separation from God.
[02:24:45.223 --> 02:24:48.888]  Here is the censored video they don't want you to see about Nuremberg 2.
[02:24:50.470 --> 02:24:51.592]  The science is settled.
[02:24:53.038 --> 02:24:55.980]  There's an overwhelming consensus that nothing worked.
[02:24:56.560 --> 02:25:00.223]  Nothing could work, nothing did work, and nothing will work.
[02:25:00.603 --> 02:25:08.588]  That includes the vaccinations, which are not just unnecessary, experimental, untested, and are actually killing people.
[02:25:09.389 --> 02:25:15.353]  I want to take this moment to point a finger directly at the principal cause of why we're all here today.
[02:25:16.414 --> 02:25:17.294]  And it's not the government.
[02:25:18.275 --> 02:25:20.597]  No, it's us physicians.
[02:25:21.744 --> 02:25:26.728]  Who have been intimidated by our colleges, both provincially and internationally.
[02:25:28.110 --> 02:25:45.965]  If physicians had not been intimidated by the very body that is supposed to protect you from me, if they'd been allowed to speak their mind without the threat of losing their income and their positions, then an individual patient, such as you and me, in a closed examining room, would have been told the truth.
[02:25:46.025 --> 02:25:46.445]  The truth!
[02:25:49.349 --> 02:25:52.730]  They have been denied that ability to do that.
[02:25:53.210 --> 02:25:55.070]  We have had that for centuries.
[02:25:56.050 --> 02:25:59.311]  The two principal medical ethics have been trampled on by this government.
[02:25:59.711 --> 02:26:01.812]  First Do No Harm and Informed Consent.
[02:26:03.232 --> 02:26:04.852]  First Do No Harm has been trampled on.
[02:26:06.653 --> 02:26:11.273]  The mandates have killed, as we've heard, more people, many more people than they've saved.
[02:26:11.874 --> 02:26:18.475]  But Informed Consent, I will put it to you, how can you give informed consent if you are not informed?
[02:26:19.291 --> 02:26:25.435]  And you have been denied information intentionally by the colleges that are supposed to protect you.
[02:26:25.816 --> 02:26:28.177]  So I say this, putting a point on it.
[02:26:28.677 --> 02:26:38.124]  The colleges of physicians and surgeons across this country and internationally are co-conspirators with government in state-sanctioned murder.
[02:26:38.984 --> 02:26:39.384]  Thank you.
[02:26:40.185 --> 02:26:42.466]  Thank you.
[02:26:44.328 --> 02:26:47.410]  Dr. Roger Hodgkinson is a pathologist.
[02:26:50.302 --> 02:26:51.703]  In Ottawa, Canada.
[02:26:51.823 --> 02:26:56.166]  But he's been speaking about what's happening in Australia, in the UK, the US, you name it.
[02:26:57.387 --> 02:27:03.952]  And he's come out and said you have a violation of the Nuremberg Code and the doctors that have gone along with this are guilty as well.
[02:27:04.432 --> 02:27:09.155]  And they don't want the censored clip of him saying you are guilty.
[02:27:09.436 --> 02:27:10.296]  So is Big Tech.
[02:27:10.736 --> 02:27:11.557]  So is Big Pharma.
[02:27:11.577 --> 02:27:23.493]   But also the doctors that know what's happening and are scared to tell people, their cowardice now makes them people that are aiding and abetting this eugenics depopulation operation where they hope to
[02:27:23.493 --> 02:27:30.532]   corrupt the medical community by getting them involved in this evil. Once they've covered
[02:27:30.532 --> 02:27:36.202]   up this lie, well now they'll cover up any lie. The clip is so important we're going to
[02:27:36.202 --> 02:27:42.041]   post it to Infowars.com. I hope you share the clip. Now separately here's some of the other news we've
[02:27:42.041 --> 02:27:44.712]  got. This is just amazing.
[02:27:47.112 --> 02:27:52.951]   This is a real photo here in the United States. It's the levels of social credit.
[02:27:53.149 --> 02:28:02.877]  No, it's not the actual social credit score on your phone that Klaus Schwab's pushing or that Justin Trudeau's announced with martial law in Canada, but it's the same idea.
[02:28:04.739 --> 02:28:06.661]  Vax required for indoor seating.
[02:28:06.901 --> 02:28:09.403]  Booster shot required for bar seating.
[02:28:09.643 --> 02:28:10.084]  Thank you.
[02:28:11.536 --> 02:28:12.377]  It's the new religion.
[02:28:13.097 --> 02:28:15.139]  Have you paid your indulgences?
[02:28:15.460 --> 02:28:17.481]  Oh, I got three shots, you only got two.
[02:28:18.202 --> 02:28:19.383]  That's not too fun, is it?
[02:28:19.423 --> 02:28:20.544]  You know, I'm better than you.
[02:28:21.385 --> 02:28:29.352]  When you're so unsuccessful in life that injecting yourself every few months with something gives you meaning, it's genuinely sad.
[02:28:29.513 --> 02:28:31.094]  Funny, but also sad.
[02:28:31.114 --> 02:28:33.116]  That's right.
[02:28:34.485 --> 02:28:38.988]  Here's another one, just like a few weeks ago with Magic Johnson, the mayor of L.A.
[02:28:39.028 --> 02:28:44.392]  and the governor of the state, didn't wear their masks and said, oh, we held our breath during it.
[02:28:44.833 --> 02:28:47.495]  Well, they got caught again, I guess, holding their breath.
[02:28:49.096 --> 02:28:50.697]  Don't hold your breath if they ever told the truth.
[02:28:51.237 --> 02:28:53.239]  Los Angeles has an indoor mask mandate.
[02:28:53.259 --> 02:28:59.784]  This is the mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, the Super Bowl, he's indoors, he also is maskless.
[02:29:01.385 --> 02:29:03.406]  Do not ever take these people seriously.
[02:29:04.545 --> 02:29:06.106]  And folks are doing skywriting now.
[02:29:06.606 --> 02:29:07.847]  Unmask our kids.
[02:29:09.348 --> 02:29:09.889]  Absolutely.
[02:29:09.989 --> 02:29:13.271]  Oh, and they just showed some of the Hollywood elites.
[02:29:14.171 --> 02:29:14.932]  Go back to that video.
[02:29:15.472 --> 02:29:16.353]  Oh, they're better than us.
[02:29:16.373 --> 02:29:20.976]  They support all the tyranny, but they don't have to wear the mask or take the shots.
[02:29:20.996 --> 02:29:23.857]  But if you don't, well, you're going to starve to death and go to jail.
[02:29:23.918 --> 02:29:30.542]  You're not like P. Diddy or 50 Cent or Matt Damon.
[02:29:32.203 --> 02:29:41.645]  All the bunch that want to be elitist, sitting around feeling powerful like LeBron James, like, you know, you're part of the winning crew now, says Ben Affleck.
[02:29:45.365 --> 02:29:46.666]  And again, I'm not mad at all these people.
[02:29:46.686 --> 02:29:48.026]  A lot of them are actually anti-mask.
[02:29:50.266 --> 02:29:55.927]  Continuing, I comply because I want it to end, the woman says to her.
[02:29:56.127 --> 02:29:58.128]  It's because you comply that it will never end.
[02:29:58.368 --> 02:29:58.928]  Absolutely.
[02:30:00.128 --> 02:30:01.589]  What does Zbigniew Brzezinski say?
[02:30:02.850 --> 02:30:12.075]  The technotronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled society, such as society would be dominated by the elite, unrestricted by traditional values.
[02:30:12.175 --> 02:30:21.881]  Soon it will be possible to assert almost continuous surveillance over every citizen and maintain up-to-date complete files containing every and even the most personal information about the citizen.
[02:30:22.302 --> 02:30:27.365]  These files will be subjected to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities.
[02:30:27.565 --> 02:30:28.325]  Between two ages. 1970.
[02:30:31.539 --> 02:30:32.259]  And it goes on.
[02:30:36.301 --> 02:30:46.025]  The child's swim mate's telling him, if you don't have all the shots, we don't check your passport, you can't be part of the swim team.
[02:30:46.045 --> 02:30:50.327]  50 million doses of vaccine recalled for causing false HIV positives.
[02:30:50.407 --> 02:30:52.308]  It's not false HIV positives.
[02:30:52.328 --> 02:30:53.649]  And this is the next big story.
[02:30:54.670 --> 02:30:57.774]  This is confirmed by medical doctors and people I've talked to that are about to come on air.
[02:30:58.155 --> 02:31:00.157]  And, of course, the discoverer of HIV said it.
[02:31:00.878 --> 02:31:01.759]  Hi, Katina.
[02:31:03.722 --> 02:31:04.163]  Tatia.
[02:31:04.743 --> 02:31:09.610]  I hope you don't mind messaging you here about the recent HIV article you shared.
[02:31:09.670 --> 02:31:10.511]  It was an M4's article.
[02:31:11.633 --> 02:31:14.314]  I don't think I can comment publicly about it.
[02:31:14.574 --> 02:31:16.595]  Thank you, regulated profession, medical worker.
[02:31:17.095 --> 02:31:22.117]  But myself and colleagues are starting to see AIDS-like conditions in our practices.
[02:31:22.557 --> 02:31:30.040]  Mouth sores, skin sores, night sweats, tonsillitis, that doesn't respond to antibiotics, dramatic weight loss, bloodshot eyes.
[02:31:31.700 --> 02:31:43.242]   When these people go to hospital, they're being told that, quote, their immune systems are shot, close quote, and the doctors don't really know What to do about it apart from try different medication.
[02:31:43.843 --> 02:31:54.471]  One of my patients with this told the consultant they were hadn't felt right after the second dose and suddenly the testing was a lot more.
[02:31:56.673 --> 02:31:57.173]  It goes on.
[02:31:58.934 --> 02:32:02.477]  We're only seeing this sort of thing in the vaxxed people.
[02:32:06.780 --> 02:32:12.071]   This is what someone just popped this into my local Stand in the park group.
[02:32:12.091 --> 02:32:14.072]  Because you know, you gotta do stuff privately.
[02:32:14.092 --> 02:32:15.273]  It's secret messages now.
[02:32:15.733 --> 02:32:16.553]  Not allowed to talk.
[02:32:16.634 --> 02:32:23.557]  I mean, after all, we're being watched by all the authorities that we take our shots, do what we're told, and get sick and die.
[02:32:23.998 --> 02:32:33.823]  After all, I mean, the head of BlackRock, Mr. Fink, Larry Fink, is a depopulationist.
[02:32:34.763 --> 02:32:35.704]  And it's his earth.
[02:32:35.744 --> 02:32:36.424]  He took it over.
[02:32:36.444 --> 02:32:37.405]  You need to die.
[02:32:38.305 --> 02:32:39.086]  You're obsolete.
[02:32:40.453 --> 02:32:41.514]  And he knows you will.
[02:32:41.594 --> 02:32:42.314]  He's better than you.
[02:32:42.374 --> 02:32:43.355]  He knows he's gonna win.
[02:32:43.775 --> 02:32:44.616]  He knows you'll submit.
[02:32:44.856 --> 02:32:48.038]  He knows you'll give your children shots when they're dying of HIV type of stuff.
[02:32:48.398 --> 02:32:53.662]  You'll get attention for it and, you know, do marathons to raise money for him, but you won't actually stop it.
[02:32:53.722 --> 02:32:53.942]  No.
[02:32:54.342 --> 02:32:55.703]  He knows you'll roll over to him.
[02:32:55.763 --> 02:32:57.264]  He knows that you are his prey.
[02:32:58.945 --> 02:32:59.326]  Dad!
[02:32:59.826 --> 02:33:00.967]  Why are they called boosters?
[02:33:02.368 --> 02:33:04.589]  Because they booth profits for big pharma, son.
[02:33:08.512 --> 02:33:13.310]   We want Only vaccinated tenants in our vaccinated community.
[02:33:15.051 --> 02:33:17.874]  That replaces, we only want white tenants for our white community.
[02:33:19.636 --> 02:33:21.638]  And this is definitely all about that.
[02:33:23.160 --> 02:33:24.502]  COVID stand discrimination.
[02:33:25.883 --> 02:33:28.386]  Gotta say no to Fauci.
[02:33:30.748 --> 02:33:32.289]  And it goes on and on and on.
[02:33:32.749 --> 02:33:34.010]  You know, I meant to play this video.
[02:33:34.030 --> 02:33:36.672]  Maybe when we come in with this Putin interview I want to air.
[02:33:36.812 --> 02:33:38.373]  You actually hear what he had to say a few weeks ago.
[02:33:38.853 --> 02:33:40.974]  Now they pull the Russian troops off their own border.
[02:33:40.994 --> 02:33:47.998]  I want to play this guy where he explains, you are now listed in the social credit score for punishment.
[02:33:48.639 --> 02:33:49.059]  Yes.
[02:33:50.080 --> 02:33:58.459]   Meanwhile, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall tests positive for COVID-19 despite being triple jabbed and The future king of England, he's sick too.
[02:33:58.499 --> 02:33:59.260]  What a load of crap.
[02:33:59.620 --> 02:34:01.521]  If you think they took that, I got a bridge.
[02:34:02.822 --> 02:34:03.403]  I want to sell you.
[02:34:03.423 --> 02:34:04.283]  Then there's this video.
[02:34:04.543 --> 02:34:05.724]  I should have led the show with this.
[02:34:06.265 --> 02:34:12.209]  Biden declares personal freedom doesn't exist and comes second to COVID mandates.
[02:34:12.249 --> 02:34:13.349]  That's what tyrants always do.
[02:34:13.630 --> 02:34:19.674]  They claim there's some group right, then they take your personal rights, and then you find out you're in a total death camp.
[02:34:20.393 --> 02:34:22.054]  Vox reports, no handshakes please.
[02:34:22.094 --> 02:34:24.716]  The tech industry is terrified of the coronavirus.
[02:34:25.056 --> 02:34:27.297]  So drag queen story time can happen with your kids.
[02:34:27.697 --> 02:34:29.518]  They can teach your kids to take Prozac and Ritalin.
[02:34:29.638 --> 02:34:29.939]  But!
[02:34:31.539 --> 02:34:33.701]  And in California you can legally give somebody AIDS knowingly.
[02:34:33.741 --> 02:34:34.641]  That's HIV.
[02:34:35.122 --> 02:34:36.002]  Or Hepatitis knowingly.
[02:34:36.042 --> 02:34:37.883]  But you can't shake hands.
[02:34:38.443 --> 02:34:39.804]  That is a crime.
[02:34:40.204 --> 02:34:40.885]  But don't worry.
[02:34:40.905 --> 02:34:44.207]  There's massive exploding HIV diagnoses now.
[02:34:45.207 --> 02:34:46.168]  Be sure and take the shot.
[02:34:48.303 --> 02:34:49.844]  So I've got Chrissy Lee's report coming up.
[02:34:49.884 --> 02:34:51.445]  I've got this very important Putin thing.
[02:34:51.765 --> 02:34:53.846]  They call it Putin propaganda if you hear from Putin.
[02:34:54.146 --> 02:34:56.427]  No, I just think you're never supposed to actually hear from the Russians.
[02:34:56.887 --> 02:34:58.828]  So we're supposed to have nuclear war with them and all die.
[02:34:58.868 --> 02:35:01.370]  I thought we might actually hear what these devils are saying.
[02:35:02.430 --> 02:35:05.292]  That's not being a Russian agent to actually hear what people say.
[02:35:06.152 --> 02:35:09.154]  I'm an American agent of Christ.
[02:35:10.094 --> 02:35:13.776]  I'm a guy that loves America and I'm loyal to my country, but I'm an agent of Jesus Christ.
[02:35:13.796 --> 02:35:14.356]  Want to know who I am?
[02:35:14.676 --> 02:35:15.297]  That's who I am.
[02:35:15.717 --> 02:35:16.677]  All right, God bless you all.
[02:35:16.697 --> 02:35:17.198]  We'll be right back.
[02:35:18.064 --> 02:35:22.488]  You have said, talked a lot about security guarantees and now we've seen your proposals.
[02:35:23.068 --> 02:35:26.251]  You also say you have no intention of invading Ukraine.
[02:35:26.872 --> 02:35:32.497]  So will you guarantee unconditionally that you will not invade Ukraine or any other sovereign country?
[02:35:32.897 --> 02:35:35.279]  Or does that depend on how negotiations go?
[02:35:36.320 --> 02:35:43.086]  And another question, what is it do you think that the West does not understand about Russia or about your intentions?
[02:35:43.405 --> 02:35:44.405]  Thank you.
[02:35:44.405 --> 02:35:55.285]   Speaking of the security guarantees and what it will depend upon or if something will depend
[02:35:55.285 --> 02:36:00.045]   upon the negotiations, our actions will not depend on the negotiation.
[02:36:00.142 --> 02:36:06.727]  They will depend on the unconditional compliance with the Russian security demands today and in the historical context.
[02:36:07.148 --> 02:36:12.792]  In this sense, we have made it clear that any further NATO movement to the east is unacceptable.
[02:36:14.073 --> 02:36:15.553]  There's nothing unclear about this.
[02:36:16.414 --> 02:36:20.695]  We are not deploying our missiles over at the borders of the U.S.
[02:36:21.075 --> 02:36:21.315]  No.
[02:36:21.815 --> 02:36:22.956]  On the other hand, the U.S.
[02:36:22.996 --> 02:36:27.837]  is deploying its missiles close to our home, on the porch of our house.
[02:36:29.337 --> 02:36:33.459]  So, are we demanding something excessive?
[02:36:33.799 --> 02:36:38.160]  We're simply asking them not to deploy their attack systems over at our home.
[02:36:38.720 --> 02:36:40.921]  What is so unusual or peculiar about that?
[02:36:42.150 --> 02:36:57.358]  So, what would the Americans think if we, for example, decided to come to the border between, say, Canada and the United States, or Mexico, and simply deploy our missiles over there?
[02:36:58.482 --> 02:37:03.604]  Well, did Mexico and the US never have any territorial disputes?
[02:37:03.884 --> 02:37:04.845]  What about California?
[02:37:04.885 --> 02:37:05.725]  What about Texas?
[02:37:06.765 --> 02:37:07.946]  Did you forget about that?
[02:37:08.346 --> 02:37:10.227]  But everything seems to have calmed down.
[02:37:10.307 --> 02:37:14.488]  Nobody remembers those things just like the way they remember about Crimea.
[02:37:14.969 --> 02:37:19.570]  We try not to remember the situation in Ukraine.
[02:37:20.091 --> 02:37:21.291]  Who created that?
[02:37:21.311 --> 02:37:22.832]  Who started the crisis?
[02:37:23.952 --> 02:37:24.733]  Was it Lenin?
[02:37:25.914 --> 02:37:37.181]  Yes, when he declared the Soviet Union in 1922 and then the Constitution of 1924 following his death was following the principles of Lenin.
[02:37:38.822 --> 02:37:42.304]  This is a matter of security, not just history.
[02:37:42.324 --> 02:37:44.026]  This is about security.
[02:37:44.446 --> 02:37:46.247]  It is not the negotiations that matter.
[02:37:46.267 --> 02:37:48.629]  It is the outcome, the result.
[02:37:49.109 --> 02:37:57.620]   I've reiterated this many times and you're well aware that We said, not an inch to the east.
[02:37:58.341 --> 02:37:59.804]  That was the NATO guarantee in 1990.
[02:37:59.844 --> 02:38:03.151]  So, what became of that?
[02:38:03.171 --> 02:38:04.974]  They fooled us!
[02:38:08.563 --> 02:38:11.585]  We've seen five waves of NATO expansion.
[02:38:12.385 --> 02:38:18.248]  Now they're in Romania and in Poland and they're deploying the relevant attack systems over there.
[02:38:18.328 --> 02:38:19.649]  That's what we're talking about.
[02:38:19.669 --> 02:38:23.171]  You should finally understand we're not threatening anyone.
[02:38:23.431 --> 02:38:26.632]  We did not come to the US borders or to the UK borders.
[02:38:27.173 --> 02:38:27.313]  No.
[02:38:28.554 --> 02:38:34.918]  They came to our borders and now they're saying that Ukraine will also join NATO and they will deploy their systems there.
[02:38:34.938 --> 02:38:38.361]  Or not just NATO, they will simply deploy it on a bilateral basis.
[02:38:38.941 --> 02:38:41.804]  They will deploy their military bases and their attack systems.
[02:38:42.024 --> 02:38:43.325]  That's what we're talking about.
[02:38:43.905 --> 02:38:46.727]  And you keep demanding some guarantees from us.
[02:38:46.948 --> 02:38:48.589]  You must give us the guarantees.
[02:38:48.929 --> 02:38:49.750]  It is up to you.
[02:38:49.990 --> 02:38:51.711]  And you must do this immediately.
[02:38:51.971 --> 02:38:52.532]  Right now.
[02:38:53.052 --> 02:38:55.414]  Instead of keep talking about this for decades.
[02:38:57.462 --> 02:39:03.566]  And use this small talk and soft talk about the need for guarantees of security for everyone.
[02:39:04.267 --> 02:39:06.088]  This is exactly what we mean.
[02:39:06.248 --> 02:39:08.410]  We are not threatening anybody.
[02:39:11.292 --> 02:39:13.193]  And now to the second part of your question.
[02:39:13.213 --> 02:39:14.174]  Could you repeat that, please?
[02:39:14.957 --> 02:39:20.919]  What is it that you think that the West does not understand about Russia or about your intentions?
[02:39:21.600 --> 02:39:22.560]  Yes, exactly.
[02:39:23.240 --> 02:39:30.883]  Well, you know, what you understand or what you don't understand, sometimes it seems to me that we live in two different worlds.
[02:39:31.403 --> 02:39:33.564]  I was speaking about very obvious things.
[02:39:33.984 --> 02:39:35.565]  How can you not understand that?
[02:39:36.265 --> 02:39:38.886]  You say you will not expand and then you keep expanding.
[02:39:39.807 --> 02:39:42.708]  You say we will have equal guarantees for everyone.
[02:39:43.308 --> 02:39:44.991]  On the number of international agreements.
[02:39:46.513 --> 02:39:49.757]  And then we see there is no equality or no equal security.
[02:39:52.080 --> 02:39:52.942]  See, here's the thing.
[02:39:54.688 --> 02:40:00.190]  Back in 1918, one of the assistants of Woodrow Wilson, the U.S.
[02:40:00.250 --> 02:40:20.832]   President, said that the whole world would feel calmer and safer if today's enormous Russia would be replaced with the states of Siberia and four more states In the European part of Russia.
[02:40:21.712 --> 02:40:27.813]  That was set in 1918 and in 1991 we separated into 12 separate parts.
[02:40:28.974 --> 02:40:33.075]  It seems to me that our partners were not satisfied with that.
[02:40:33.375 --> 02:40:35.656]  They think that Russia is a tad too large.
[02:40:35.976 --> 02:40:40.277]  Even the European countries have turned themselves into a union of states.
[02:40:42.287 --> 02:40:54.902]  They are quite small states with populations of 60 to 80 million people, but even after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, we only had 146 million people, and that is too much for the West.
[02:40:55.463 --> 02:41:00.409]  I think that is the only explanation for their constant pressure against us back in the 1990s.
[02:41:02.369 --> 02:41:07.793]  The Soviet Union did everything it could to build normal relations with the West, with the United States.
[02:41:08.194 --> 02:41:15.319]  I will keep saying this, and I will repeat for your viewers and listeners out there from the media that you represent.
[02:41:15.360 --> 02:41:17.541]  I didn't quite get that, but that doesn't matter.
[02:41:19.683 --> 02:41:29.391]   Our nuclear sites Our military nuclear sites had experts from the US intelligence authorities.
[02:41:29.431 --> 02:41:30.472]  They were going there.
[02:41:30.872 --> 02:41:35.156]  It was their job to visit the Russian military nuclear sites.
[02:41:35.196 --> 02:41:36.958]  They spend their whole days over there.
[02:41:37.638 --> 02:41:43.023]  And the Russian government had advisors from the CIA working inside of it.
[02:41:43.403 --> 02:41:44.584]  What else did you need?
[02:41:45.185 --> 02:41:56.956]   Why did you have to support the terrorists in Northern Caucasus and use The terrorist organizations to reach your goals and break down the Russian Federation.
[02:41:57.256 --> 02:41:58.958]  This was exactly what you were doing.
[02:41:59.038 --> 02:42:01.721]  And as a former director of the FSB, I know that.
[02:42:03.083 --> 02:42:09.209]  We were working with the double agents and they were reporting to us on the tasks of the Western intelligence agencies.
[02:42:09.690 --> 02:42:11.091]  Why did you have to do that?
[02:42:11.912 --> 02:42:13.974]  You should have done something different.
[02:42:14.054 --> 02:42:17.278]  Perhaps treat Russia as a possible ally and strengthen trust.
[02:42:17.658 --> 02:42:18.299]  But no.
[02:42:18.779 --> 02:42:21.141]  Instead you tried to keep breaking us up.
[02:42:21.702 --> 02:42:24.244]  And then you started the NATO expansion to the east.
[02:42:24.264 --> 02:42:25.706]  We were saying, don't do that.
[02:42:25.726 --> 02:42:26.947]  You had promised you wouldn't.
[02:42:27.267 --> 02:42:29.710]  And they say, where is it put in written form?
[02:42:30.210 --> 02:42:30.631]  Nowhere.
[02:42:30.871 --> 02:42:34.294]  Well, then naff off and we don't care about your concerns.
[02:42:35.696 --> 02:42:42.787]  And every time we kept responding and trying to make obstacles, we were expressing our concerns about that.
[02:42:43.148 --> 02:42:43.769]  But they say no.
[02:42:46.042 --> 02:42:50.124]  You can do whatever you want about your concerns.
[02:42:50.164 --> 02:42:51.405]  We will do whatever we need.
[02:42:51.825 --> 02:42:54.186]  One, two, three, four, five.
[02:42:54.886 --> 02:42:57.608]  We witnessed five waves of NATO expansion.
[02:42:58.168 --> 02:42:59.468]  Why can't they understand?
[02:42:59.969 --> 02:43:01.069]  What is unclear?
[02:43:01.549 --> 02:43:02.730]  I believe everything is clear.
[02:43:02.890 --> 02:43:04.811]  We are thinking about our own security.
[02:43:08.649 --> 02:43:11.471]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[02:43:11.531 --> 02:43:12.432]  Let me think, just let me think.
[02:43:12.452 --> 02:43:18.176]  I suspect even now orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[02:43:18.216 --> 02:43:19.877]  It's Chancellor Sutcliffe.
[02:43:19.897 --> 02:43:20.238]  Damn it!
[02:43:20.278 --> 02:43:20.598]  Why?
[02:43:21.319 --> 02:43:27.303]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[02:43:27.944 --> 02:43:31.066]  Words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen.
[02:43:33.675 --> 02:43:38.659]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[02:43:38.679 --> 02:43:39.680]  You decided, sir.
[02:43:39.720 --> 02:43:40.641]  You wanted it foolproof.
[02:43:40.661 --> 02:43:42.062]  You taught me every television in London!
[02:43:42.323 --> 02:43:44.284]  Cruelty and injustice.
[02:43:44.404 --> 02:43:45.806]  Intolerance and oppression.
[02:43:46.226 --> 02:43:56.135]  And where once you had the freedom to object and think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and selecting your submission.
[02:43:56.155 --> 02:43:56.735]  We need cameras.
[02:43:57.076 --> 02:43:57.796]  How did this happen?
[02:43:58.497 --> 02:43:59.278]  Who's to blame?
[02:44:00.178 --> 02:44:02.922]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[02:44:03.282 --> 02:44:04.944]  They will be held accountable.
[02:44:05.285 --> 02:44:10.692]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[02:44:11.906 --> 02:44:13.707]  I know why you did it.
[02:44:13.887 --> 02:44:14.968]  I know you were afraid.
[02:44:15.388 --> 02:44:16.149]  Who would it be?
[02:44:16.629 --> 02:44:17.090]  War?
[02:44:17.390 --> 02:44:17.770]  Terror?
[02:44:18.010 --> 02:44:18.691]  Disease?
[02:44:19.311 --> 02:44:25.675]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[02:44:25.755 --> 02:44:27.196]  Fear got the best of you.
[02:44:27.577 --> 02:44:31.439]  And in your panic, you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[02:44:32.160 --> 02:44:33.241]  He promised you order.
[02:44:33.281 --> 02:44:34.261]  He promised you peace.
[02:44:34.561 --> 02:44:38.561]   And all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[02:44:38.561 --> 02:44:44.561]  [Music]
[02:44:44.561 --> 02:44:46.561]  There is a war in the world.
[02:44:46.728 --> 02:44:47.729]  It's happening now.
[02:44:48.589 --> 02:44:50.391]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[02:44:50.911 --> 02:44:52.792]  The time to choose sides has come.
[02:44:53.573 --> 02:44:55.054]  We are the resistance.
[02:44:55.454 --> 02:45:02.939]  We are the InfoWar.
[02:45:04.140 --> 02:45:05.121]  Take me through what happened.
[02:45:05.481 --> 02:45:09.584]  Did she have COVID and was taken to the hospital or what happened that day?
[02:45:10.382 --> 02:45:14.864]  We had tested Grace for COVID and she was tested positive on October 1st at home.
[02:45:15.644 --> 02:45:29.530]  We really didn't think anything of it because we were following the frontline doctor's protocol to a T. What happened was, is day 8 or 9, somewhere in there, she couldn't maintain her oxygen above 90% saturation.
[02:45:30.030 --> 02:45:32.892]  They said, we want to admit Grace to the hospital.
[02:45:32.932 --> 02:45:35.713]  I said, well then I'll be staying with her.
[02:45:35.853 --> 02:45:37.133]  And they said, well, you can't.
[02:45:37.153 --> 02:45:38.454]  I said, well, what do you mean I can't?
[02:45:39.275 --> 02:45:43.460]  And they said, well, our hospital protocol doesn't allow you to stay in the room.
[02:45:43.480 --> 02:45:45.182]  I said, well, then I'll be taking Grace home.
[02:45:46.404 --> 02:45:48.666]  And unfortunately, they came back.
[02:45:48.686 --> 02:45:57.638]  You know, I say unfortunately, because Grace died, but unfortunately, they came back two hours later and said, well, we decided you can stay as long as you don't leave the room.
[02:45:58.570 --> 02:46:05.857]  And so I said well that's of course fine, I mean I'm not going anywhere with the full expectation I was going to catch COVID from Grace.
[02:46:06.598 --> 02:46:17.067]  That evening, so this was the evening of October 7th, we had a little bit of an issue in that Grace was starting to get frustrated with the high flow nasal cannula.
[02:46:17.868 --> 02:46:39.131]   They put this cannula on her that was shooting air up her nostrils at a high And she didn't want that so then we worked, I worked with the nurses and the respiratory therapists on getting a BiPAP map to fix that problem and ultimately it took about three and a half hours on and off and we finally got it situated.
[02:46:39.591 --> 02:46:48.717]  So the morning of October 8th, a doctor came in at 8 o'clock and said, your daughter is going to need to be on a ventilator in the next two hours.
[02:46:49.417 --> 02:46:51.338]  And I said, what is that based on?
[02:46:53.482 --> 02:46:58.188]  And he said it's based on the blood gas numbers that they drew the night before.
[02:46:58.228 --> 02:47:00.090]  I said, what time did you draw them?
[02:47:00.110 --> 02:47:00.891]  He said 1130.
[02:47:01.551 --> 02:47:06.217]  So we just got done wrestling with Grace on and off for three and a half, four hours.
[02:47:06.297 --> 02:47:07.819]  I said, I don't think those numbers are accurate.
[02:47:07.899 --> 02:47:09.681]  Her blood pressure was 235 over 135.
[02:47:09.741 --> 02:47:11.002]  Her heart rate was 150 beats per minute.
[02:47:11.142 --> 02:47:16.853]   I said that You guys took it at the worst possible times.
[02:47:16.973 --> 02:47:20.856]  I said I'd like to have those numbers taken again.
[02:47:20.896 --> 02:47:25.099]  And so they took them at my request and she was of course fine.
[02:47:25.159 --> 02:47:27.881]  So we dodged the ventilator bullet.
[02:47:28.922 --> 02:47:33.305]  The next day, October 9th, was another fairly significant event.
[02:47:33.325 --> 02:47:34.226]  Grace was great.
[02:47:34.246 --> 02:47:34.726]  She got up.
[02:47:35.407 --> 02:47:36.307]  She was pretty hungry.
[02:47:36.347 --> 02:47:37.428]  Didn't eat much the day before.
[02:47:37.988 --> 02:47:45.164]   And so I ordered food, started feeding her and the nurse came running in and said, you can't do that.
[02:47:45.404 --> 02:47:47.224]  I said, well, what's the, what's the reason?
[02:47:48.264 --> 02:47:51.465]  And she said, well, because Grace's oxygen saturation is only at 85%.
[02:47:52.066 --> 02:47:57.907]  Remember I told you I had my oxygen saturation meter, so I put it on her finger and it read 95%.
[02:47:58.607 --> 02:48:01.648]  So I called the nurse and I said, is my meter accurate?
[02:48:01.728 --> 02:48:02.428]  She said, yes.
[02:48:02.509 --> 02:48:06.550]  I said, well, why is my $50 meter more accurate than your $50,000 meter?
[02:48:08.872 --> 02:48:13.116]  And she said, well, the leads get sweaty and so these type of things happen.
[02:48:13.376 --> 02:48:16.039]  I said, you've got to be kidding me.
[02:48:16.219 --> 02:48:23.545]  I said, if you know that, why don't you just trade these leads out every four hours or whatever it takes so that you have an accurate reading.
[02:48:23.605 --> 02:48:29.731]  This is the single most important statistic that you are using to manage my daughter's care.
[02:48:32.233 --> 02:48:34.296]  You should just be thankful you caught this.
[02:48:34.636 --> 02:48:37.241]  She's on 1.4 units of Presidex.
[02:48:37.621 --> 02:48:40.726]  They give her two doses of lorazepam three minutes apart.
[02:48:41.187 --> 02:48:42.409]  It may have to be a mistake.
[02:48:42.489 --> 02:48:43.010]  I'm guessing.
[02:48:43.050 --> 02:48:43.431]  I don't know.
[02:48:44.613 --> 02:48:44.973]  Done at 615.
[02:48:46.730 --> 02:48:52.571]  They give her two milligrams of morphine as a IV push, which means they gave it to her instantly, not as a drip.
[02:48:53.291 --> 02:48:58.253]  The morphine package insert is so condemning to what they did.
[02:48:58.433 --> 02:49:00.593]  It says to not do this specifically.
[02:49:00.673 --> 02:49:06.334]  Don't combine it with Presidex or Orazepam because it causes death.
[02:49:06.974 --> 02:49:09.375]  Jessica now, Jessica's in the room as the advocate.
[02:49:09.835 --> 02:49:13.856]  At 720, she calls us panicking because Grace's numbers are just dropping.
[02:49:14.728 --> 02:49:19.590]  And so Jeff, my wife and I are on FaceTime saying, get the nurses in.
[02:49:19.630 --> 02:49:21.191]  She said, Dad, I can't get them in.
[02:49:21.231 --> 02:49:21.931]  They won't come in.
[02:49:22.131 --> 02:49:24.112]  So now we're hollering, save our daughter.
[02:49:24.613 --> 02:49:27.034]  And they holler back, she's DNR.
[02:49:27.194 --> 02:49:28.214]  Do not resuscitate.
[02:49:28.234 --> 02:49:31.436]  That's the first we know she's DNR.
[02:49:31.776 --> 02:49:32.876]  This is so sick.
[02:49:33.917 --> 02:49:37.118]  So, you know, ultimately seven minutes go by.
[02:49:36.957 --> 02:49:51.517]  we watched Grace die on FaceTime at 727 that evening.
[02:49:51.517 --> 02:49:57.117]   The 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing will one day be written in the history books as they
[02:49:57.117 --> 02:50:02.796]   parade celebrating the point at which the United States lost its ability to perceive
[02:50:02.796 --> 02:50:08.517]   reality and embrace the impending doom brought on by the selling out of its most powerful
[02:50:08.517 --> 02:50:15.237]   assets by a self-serving, treasonous elite class of baby boomer, politicians and economic
[02:50:15.237 --> 02:50:16.396]  prostitutes.
[02:50:16.658 --> 02:50:20.559]  I would say to our athletes, you're there to compete.
[02:50:21.199 --> 02:50:27.041]  Do not risk incurring the anger of the Chinese government because they are ruthless.
[02:50:27.941 --> 02:50:32.622]  I know there is a temptation on the part of some to speak out while they are there.
[02:50:32.642 --> 02:50:34.503]  I respect that.
[02:50:35.303 --> 02:50:39.444]  But I also worry about what the Chinese government might do.
[02:50:40.325 --> 02:50:42.948]  To their reputations, to their families.
[02:50:42.988 --> 02:50:44.849]  Nobody cares about what's happening to the Leakers, okay?
[02:50:45.029 --> 02:50:48.272]  You bring it up because you really care, and I think it's nice that you care.
[02:50:48.713 --> 02:50:49.594]  What do you mean nobody cares?
[02:50:49.994 --> 02:50:51.696]  The rest of us don't care.
[02:50:51.916 --> 02:50:55.519]  I'm just telling you a very hard, I'm telling you a very hard ugly truth, okay?
[02:50:55.599 --> 02:50:58.202]  Of all the things that I care about, yes, it is below my line.
[02:50:58.522 --> 02:51:16.067]  The irony of statements like these is that the very CCP tyranny they either ignore or bow down to is already in the United States, as those rightfully exercising their First Amendment still await the communist-style circus of the January 6th Committee.
[02:51:16.167 --> 02:51:21.849]  You can't lock up a whole group of people and somehow identify them as terrorists in advance.
[02:51:22.389 --> 02:51:26.610]  A terror event on your own people to prevent terrorism, just, that doesn't make sense.
[02:51:27.745 --> 02:51:34.171]  And we won't ignore what our intelligence agency have determined to be the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today.
[02:51:36.213 --> 02:51:37.695]  White supremacy is terrorism.
[02:51:38.567 --> 02:51:43.788]  If you aren't up to speed, China's policy of mass genocide is skyrocketing.
[02:51:44.128 --> 02:51:57.731]  After killing a reported 1.2 million Tibetans... The Chinese army continued its progress towards Lhasa in a peaceful march that the Chinese news broadcast to their people.
[02:51:57.991 --> 02:52:10.476]   It was with more curiosity than animosity that the Tibetan population Isolated from the world for centuries, watched the arrival of these strange invaders posing as liberators.
[02:52:10.616 --> 02:52:17.479]  And imprisoning two million Uyghurs in the largest network of forced labor detention camps on the face of the earth.
[02:52:17.699 --> 02:52:26.324]  These satellite images show the site where Terseny says she was held, sharing a cell with 13 other women with a bucket for a toilet.
[02:52:26.844 --> 02:52:28.305]  And she's haunted by one image.
[02:52:29.125 --> 02:52:33.672]  Masked men coming down a camp corridor like this one after midnight.
[02:52:34.132 --> 02:52:35.354]  They were three men.
[02:52:36.957 --> 02:52:38.879]  Not one, but three.
[02:52:40.422 --> 02:52:43.947]  They did whatever evil their mind could think of.
[02:52:44.525 --> 02:52:47.146]  And they didn't spare any part of my body.
[02:52:47.806 --> 02:52:52.207]  Fighting me to the extent that it was disgusting to look at.
[02:52:52.687 --> 02:52:57.388]  And imprisoning 5,000 Christians, including 1,000 Christian leaders.
[02:52:57.708 --> 02:53:07.391]  Not to mention a myriad of horrific human rights abuses against the Chinese people, including forced abortion, sterilization, and organ extractions.
[02:53:07.851 --> 02:53:23.562]   For over a decade, the People's Republic of China ...has stood publicly accused of acts of cruelty and wickedness that match the cruelty and wickedness of many evil torturers and executioners.
[02:53:25.443 --> 02:53:34.811]  It's stated, with certainty, that in China, forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience has been practiced for a substantial period of time.
[02:53:35.731 --> 02:53:51.469]  The report underscored that there were extraordinarily short waiting times for organs to be available for transplantation, and numerous websites advertised hearts, lungs, and kidneys for sale, suggesting an on-demand industry.
[02:53:52.230 --> 02:54:18.649]  The Olympics themselves have been a historic ratings disaster, but NBC keeps on pushing their departure from compassion, common sense, and moral courage into the homes of any American gullible enough to sit transfixed by the brutal spectacle that is less than a decade away from having a hand in toppling Western civilization under the New World Order plan known as Agenda 2030.
[02:54:19.330 --> 02:54:20.411]  John Bowne reporting.
[02:54:21.131 --> 02:54:28.816]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the foods.
[02:54:28.876 --> 02:54:29.777]  It's all come out.
[02:54:30.397 --> 02:54:36.842]  And they're doing that not because we're weak, but because we're made in the image of God, the Creator, and we are powerful.
[02:54:37.162 --> 02:54:39.644]  And the social engineers fear that so much.
[02:54:40.404 --> 02:54:46.168]  So that's why I repeat that famous Internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with, but boy, is it true.
[02:54:48.052 --> 02:54:53.313]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[02:54:53.874 --> 02:55:06.097]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the god of this world who is a loser.
[02:55:06.637 --> 02:55:10.082]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep Infowars in the air now more than ever.
[02:55:10.563 --> 02:55:15.730]  Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is satanic.
[02:55:16.049 --> 02:55:20.049]   And we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they just announced.
[02:55:20.049 --> 02:55:42.209]  You're looking at Infowars newest designer t-shirt.
[02:55:43.110 --> 02:55:45.173]  It's the Presidential Emoji shirt!
[02:55:46.038 --> 02:55:53.642]  And it's got all 46 presidents going back to the founding of this nation with George Washington.
[02:55:54.203 --> 02:55:57.645]  And it ends up with Obama, Trump and Biden.
[02:55:58.145 --> 02:55:59.586]  And of course, Biden is a clown.
[02:56:00.066 --> 02:56:06.009]  Trump's wearing the sunglasses and we know that Barack Obama is not a good friend of America.
[02:56:06.509 --> 02:56:08.170]  This shirt is very thought provoking.
[02:56:08.270 --> 02:56:12.513]   It'll cause a lot of conversations and it's a great Way to wake people up.
[02:56:12.553 --> 02:56:14.254]  It also makes a great gift.
[02:56:14.274 --> 02:56:18.416]  You're not just giving someone the gift of a fun t-shirt when you give them this.
[02:56:19.597 --> 02:56:22.198]  You're also funding the information war.
[02:56:22.278 --> 02:56:30.863]  And there are dozens and dozens and dozens of new t-shirts that we've designed in the last six months that are now available at InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:56:31.203 --> 02:56:37.306]  And when you purchase the shirt, you're giving yourself the gift of waking up the world and living in a free society.
[02:56:37.717 --> 02:56:40.741]  So get one for yourself and give one as a gift.
[02:56:41.101 --> 02:56:44.085]  All of it is a 360 win and it keeps us on the air.
[02:56:44.425 --> 02:56:53.736]  All the Democrats and the Deep State and the Demos Group and Klaus Schwab and the Globalists are fighting around the clock to shut us down because they can't succeed if we stay on the air.
[02:56:54.497 --> 02:57:00.220]  And, of course, we have a whole line of amazing 1776 shirts in short sleeve and long sleeve.
[02:57:00.580 --> 02:57:05.843]  And then, of course, there's one of my favorites, the Vaccine Passport T-shirt.
[02:57:06.303 --> 02:57:15.648]  This lets the globalists know you're not signing on to their mark of the beast and you're fully aware of what they're doing and you're educating other sheeple at the same time while funding the InfoWar.
[02:57:16.028 --> 02:57:17.268]  A true 360 win.
[02:57:17.669 --> 02:57:22.371]  Get yours now with hundreds of other amazing T-shirts to choose from at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:57:22.811 --> 02:57:26.833]  All of this art is original and it's incredibly thought-provoking, like this one.
[02:57:27.594 --> 02:57:31.556]  You've got one mouse asking the other mouse, are you going to take the vaccine?
[02:57:32.056 --> 02:57:32.896]  He says, no way!
[02:57:33.297 --> 02:57:35.758]  They haven't even finished the human trials yet.
[02:57:36.518 --> 02:57:39.740]  These are the type of shirts you'll find exclusively at M4WarStore.com.
[02:57:40.100 --> 02:57:42.761]  Again, hundreds and hundreds of shirts to choose from.
[02:57:43.162 --> 02:57:48.904]  Dozens and dozens of new shirts that we just produced in the last few months and it funds the InfoWars and it spreads the word.
[02:57:48.984 --> 02:57:52.146]  Like this one, which is mainly for Texans, but other folks might want one.
[02:57:52.726 --> 02:57:54.907]  Most likely to secede.
[02:57:55.668 --> 02:58:00.650]  It's all available at InfoWarsTore.com and it keeps us on air and it exercises free speech in the public.
[02:58:01.050 --> 02:58:02.571]  Something the left doesn't want.
[02:58:02.971 --> 02:58:07.053]  So again, thanks for keeping us on the air and thanks for shopping at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:58:07.172 --> 02:58:10.852]   I want to salute and thank you all for your support and want to encourage you to go and
[02:58:10.852 --> 02:58:16.011]   get these t-shirts and other pieces of apparel and wear them openly, loudly and proudly and
[02:58:16.011 --> 02:58:19.572]   let the leftists know they're never going to silence us, they're never going to break
[02:58:19.572 --> 02:58:30.612]   our will and we are going to take America and the world back.
[02:58:30.553 --> 02:58:31.955]  Michael, you're on the InfoWars War Room.
[02:58:31.975 --> 02:58:32.315]  Go ahead.
[02:58:32.655 --> 02:58:33.376]  Hey, Owen.
[02:58:33.456 --> 02:58:35.418]  It's truly an honor to speak to you.
[02:58:35.438 --> 02:58:36.979]  So, quick product plug.
[02:58:37.099 --> 02:58:39.801]  I just wanted to plug COVIDland Part 2, the mask.
[02:58:40.482 --> 02:58:43.044]  If people are still on the verge of getting it, get it.
[02:58:43.445 --> 02:58:46.027]  Get it, share it, post it, whatever.
[02:58:46.047 --> 02:58:48.189]  Because, I mean, I watched the first one.
[02:58:48.229 --> 02:58:48.989]  First one was great.
[02:58:49.049 --> 02:58:53.113]  Second one, I mean, me and my wife were literally in tears when it went over.
[02:58:53.702 --> 02:58:58.262]   The impact on the children, I mean, it's just, it's very powerful.
[02:58:58.262 --> 02:59:09.862]   When I started hearing the schools start talking about putting children in masks
[02:59:09.862 --> 02:59:12.983]   in order to be able to go back to school, I thought it was a joke.
[02:59:13.175 --> 02:59:16.537]  I thought, who in their right mind would put a mask on a child?
[02:59:18.012 --> 02:59:20.394]  Masks on children is quite the slippery slope.
[02:59:20.774 --> 02:59:21.514]  Look at your children.
[02:59:22.375 --> 02:59:23.076]  They're confused.
[02:59:23.636 --> 02:59:24.857]  They come home lethargic.
[02:59:25.217 --> 02:59:26.038]  They're frustrated.
[02:59:26.498 --> 02:59:28.099]  You may see variances in their mood.
[02:59:28.719 --> 02:59:32.342]  It's because when you are wearing a mask, it makes you tired.
[02:59:33.973 --> 02:59:35.434]  We elected the five of you.
[02:59:35.674 --> 02:59:38.115]  We chose you to make difficult decisions for our children.
[02:59:38.375 --> 02:59:41.777]  We chose you to make decisions that would be in our children's best interest.
[02:59:42.057 --> 02:59:55.405]  Enforcing five, six, seven, eight, and nine-year-old little children to cover their noses and their mouths where they breathe for seven hours a day, every day for the last nine months for a virus that you know doesn't affect them.
[02:59:56.312 --> 02:59:58.534]  That is not in their best interest!
[02:59:59.134 --> 03:00:01.496]  And this has to stop!
[03:00:01.957 --> 03:00:06.060]  The mask has been used for millennia to subjugate the human spirit.
[03:00:06.520 --> 03:00:13.346]  It hides the endlessly changing expressions that allow us to express our emotions and empathize with one another.
[03:00:14.367 --> 03:00:16.548]  The mask becomes our only expression.
[03:00:17.329 --> 03:00:19.211]  It is fixed and unchanging.
[03:00:19.771 --> 03:00:21.072]  This is the purpose of the mask.
[03:00:21.352 --> 03:00:25.296]  To turn us into expressionless animals and submissive slaves.
