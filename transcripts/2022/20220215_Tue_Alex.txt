[00:00.000 --> 00:29.680]  The 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing will one day be written in the history books
[00:29.680 --> 00:35.760]  as they parade celebrating the point at which the United States lost its ability to perceive
[00:35.760 --> 00:42.240]  reality and embrace the impending doom brought on by this selling out of its most powerful assets
[00:42.240 --> 00:49.440]  by a self-serving treasonous elite class of baby boomer politicians and economic prostitutes.
[00:49.440 --> 00:57.200]  I would say to our athletes, you're there to compete. Do not risk incurring the anger of
[00:57.200 --> 01:03.040]  the Chinese government because they are ruthless. I know there is a temptation on the part of some
[01:03.600 --> 01:11.120]  to speak out while they are there. I respect that, but I also worry about what the Chinese
[01:11.120 --> 01:16.560]  government might do to their reputations, to their families. And nobody cares about what's
[01:16.560 --> 01:20.480]  happening to the leakers, okay? You bring it up because you really care and I think that's nice
[01:20.480 --> 01:23.600]  that you care. What do you mean nobody cares? The rest of us don't care. I'm just telling you
[01:23.600 --> 01:28.080]  don't care. You're saying you personally don't care? I'm telling you a very hard ugly truth,
[01:28.080 --> 01:33.200]  okay? Of all the things that I care about, yes, it is below my line. The irony of statements like
[01:33.200 --> 01:40.400]  these is that the very CCP tyranny they either ignore or bow down to is already in the United
[01:40.400 --> 01:46.400]  States as those rightfully exercising their First Amendment still await the Communist style
[01:46.400 --> 01:52.000]  circus of the January 6th committee. You can't lock up a whole group of people and somehow
[01:52.000 --> 01:58.240]  identify them as terrorists in advance. A terror event on your own people to prevent terrorism
[01:58.240 --> 02:02.880]  just that doesn't make sense. And we won't ignore what our intelligence agencies have
[02:03.600 --> 02:06.960]  determined to be the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today.
[02:08.960 --> 02:15.840]  White supremacy is terrorism. If you aren't up to speed, China's policy of mass genocide is
[02:15.840 --> 02:25.440]  skyrocketing after killing a reported 1.2 million Tibetans. The Chinese army continued its progress
[02:25.440 --> 02:31.520]  towards Lhasa in a peaceful march that the Chinese news broadcast to their people. It was with more
[02:31.520 --> 02:38.560]  curiosity than animosity that the Tibetan population, isolated from the world for centuries,
[02:38.560 --> 02:45.920]  watched the arrival of these strange invaders posing as liberators and imprisoning 2 million Uyghurs
[02:45.920 --> 02:50.480]  in the largest network of forced labor detention camps on the face of the earth.
[02:50.480 --> 02:57.120]  These satellite images show the site where Tersanay says she was held sharing a cell with 13 other
[02:57.120 --> 03:03.840]  women with a bucket for a toilet. And she's haunted by one image, masked men coming down a camp
[03:03.840 --> 03:14.640]  corridor like this one after midnight. They were three men, not one but three. They did whatever
[03:14.640 --> 03:21.760]  evil their mind could think of, and they didn't spare any part of my body, fighting it to the
[03:21.760 --> 03:29.280]  extent that it was disgusting to look at. And imprisoning 5,000 Christians, including 1,000
[03:29.280 --> 03:35.280]  Christian leaders, not to mention a myriad of horrific human rights abuses against the Chinese
[03:35.280 --> 03:42.400]  people, including forced abortion, sterilization, and organ extractions. For over a decade, the
[03:42.400 --> 03:50.720]  People's Republic of China has stood publicly accused of acts of cruelty and wickedness that
[03:50.720 --> 04:00.320]  match the cruelty and wickedness of medieval torturers and execution. It's stated with certainty
[04:00.320 --> 04:05.760]  that in China, forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience has been practiced
[04:05.760 --> 04:12.080]  for a substantial period of time. The report underscored that there were extraordinarily
[04:12.080 --> 04:18.640]  short waiting times for organs to be available for transplantation, and numerous websites advertised
[04:18.640 --> 04:26.640]  hearts, lungs, and kidneys for sale, suggesting an on-demand industry. The Olympics themselves
[04:26.640 --> 04:33.760]  have been a historic ratings disaster, but NBC keeps on pushing their departure from compassion,
[04:33.760 --> 04:40.880]  common sense, and moral courage into the homes of any American gullible enough to sit transfixed
[04:40.880 --> 04:46.720]  by the brutal spectacle that is less than a decade away from having a hand in toppling
[04:46.720 --> 04:53.280]  Western civilization under the New World Order plan known as Agenda 2030. John Bown reporting.
[05:17.040 --> 05:46.640]  And none of it can succeed. None of it can actually
[05:46.640 --> 05:53.040]  be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gaslit. That's why truth comes with hard work
[05:53.040 --> 05:57.120]  and with research and with diligence, and that's why it's hard to share in Full Wars links and
[05:57.120 --> 06:00.400]  Bandai video links. That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[06:00.400 --> 06:17.680]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:17.680 --> 06:31.040]  After discussing with Cabinet and Caucus, after consultation with premiers from all provinces
[06:31.040 --> 06:39.520]  and territories, after speaking with opposition leaders, the federal government has invoked
[06:39.520 --> 06:46.640]  the Emergencies Act to supplement provincial and territorial capacity to address the blockades
[06:46.640 --> 06:55.680]  and occupations. I want to be very clear. The scope of these measures will be time limited,
[06:56.560 --> 07:04.800]  geographically targeted, as well as reasonable and proportionate to the threats they are meant
[07:04.800 --> 07:11.920]  to address. The Emergencies Act will be used to strengthen and support law enforcement agencies
[07:11.920 --> 07:19.520]  at all levels across the country. This is about keeping Canadians safe, protecting
[07:19.520 --> 07:27.440]  people's jobs, and restoring confidence in our institutions. Here's how the measures we're
[07:27.440 --> 07:34.880]  taking today will help get the situation under control. The police will be given more tools
[07:34.880 --> 07:40.400]  to restore order in places where public assemblies can constitute illegal and dangerous
[07:40.400 --> 07:46.880]  activities, such as blockades and occupations, as seen in Ottawa, the Ambassador Bridge, and
[07:46.880 --> 07:54.320]  elsewhere. These tools include strengthening their ability to impose fines or imprisonment.
[07:55.600 --> 08:01.760]  The government will designate, secure, and protect places and infrastructure that are
[08:01.760 --> 08:07.840]  critical to our economy and people's jobs, including border crossings and airports.
[08:07.840 --> 08:17.520]  We cannot and will not allow illegal and dangerous activities to continue. The Emergencies Act
[08:17.520 --> 08:22.720]  will also allow the government to make sure essential services are rendered, for example,
[08:22.720 --> 08:30.800]  in order to tow vehicles blocking roads. In addition, financial institutions will be
[08:30.800 --> 08:38.000]  authorized or directed to render essential services to help address the situation, including by
[08:38.000 --> 08:45.840]  regulating and prohibiting the use of property to fund or support illegal blockades. And finally,
[08:47.040 --> 08:54.160]  we'll enable the RCMP to enforce municipal bylaws and provincial offenses where required.
[08:54.160 --> 09:04.160]  This is what the Emergencies Act does. Let me be equally clear about what it does not do.
[09:04.160 --> 09:10.720]  We're not using the Emergencies Act to call in the military. We're not suspending fundamental
[09:10.720 --> 09:17.840]  rights or overriding the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. We are not limiting people's freedom
[09:17.840 --> 09:24.560]  of speech. We are not limiting freedom of peaceful assembly. We are not preventing people
[09:24.560 --> 09:34.160]  from exercising their right to protest legally. We are reinforcing the principles, values, and
[09:34.160 --> 09:56.160]  institutions that keep all Canadians free.
[09:56.160 --> 10:04.720]  Trudeau is delivering on Klaus Schwab's stated goal to use worldwide lockdowns to trigger
[10:06.960 --> 10:13.120]  peasant revolts, which could then be used as a pretext to bring in permanent martial law
[10:13.680 --> 10:22.640]  through the private central banks alliance with big tech to surveil and control and censor
[10:22.640 --> 10:30.800]  and debank and deplatform anyone that criticizes the ongoing martial law medical tyranny expansion.
[10:32.720 --> 10:39.920]  And that's where we are on this live Tuesday, February 15 worldwide transmission. We have the
[10:39.920 --> 10:47.440]  ruling class, the megabanks, the most powerful billionaires and families on earth, waging war
[10:47.440 --> 10:55.440]  on civilization, waging war on our very biology, waging war on our very children and our families.
[10:59.360 --> 11:06.320]  We have the incredible news stack of news right here with major US newspapers parroting the Canadian
[11:06.320 --> 11:12.800]  papers saying that freedom is a bad thing and that the word freedom is racist.
[11:12.800 --> 11:18.640]  Also, major department of education organizations are coming out and saying no one should be allowed
[11:18.640 --> 11:25.600]  to say Mr. or Mrs. This is a fundamental attack on the biology of humans. This is a biomedical
[11:25.600 --> 11:31.440]  takeover. We're going to be covering it all here today and anyone signing on to this pretending
[11:31.440 --> 11:37.280]  like you're going to get ahead is a fool. This is a total enslavement system that is unspoken
[11:37.280 --> 11:42.720]  evil and they just hope the public goes into mass Stockholm syndrome and submits, but that's not
[11:42.720 --> 11:49.760]  happening. So we force them to accelerate their program of control and to compact it in over just
[11:49.760 --> 11:57.280]  a few years instead of the next decade. And that is going to end up being explosive in so many ways.
[11:57.280 --> 12:02.480]  And you know now that the civil emergency, the martial law, the financial law, the civil
[12:02.480 --> 12:12.640]  emergency, the martial law has been announced in the area of Canada that they're going to now
[12:12.640 --> 12:20.080]  trigger the violence as the pretext to use the military physically on the thousands and thousands
[12:20.080 --> 12:26.160]  of men, women and children peacefully. So we're going to be talking about that in a little bit
[12:26.160 --> 12:32.640]  about the military physically on the thousands and thousands of men, women and children peacefully,
[12:32.640 --> 12:38.400]  happily, cheerfully protesting the biomedical tyranny announcing ownership of their very bodies.
[12:41.680 --> 12:46.560]  Freedom convoy organizers say they notify police for being told nefarious elements planned to
[12:46.560 --> 12:52.880]  discredit the protests. Yes, they'll now have Antifa descend like vampire bats dressed as the
[12:52.880 --> 12:58.320]  patriots to firebomb and shoot police is what they'll undoubtedly start doing very, very soon.
[12:58.320 --> 13:03.680]  They'll probably be a car bomb as well. It's very easy to predict this. I told you next they would
[13:03.680 --> 13:12.400]  start grabbing the bank accounts of the protesters. Meanwhile, Trudeau, of course, loves promoting
[13:12.400 --> 13:16.240]  violent communist demonstrations around the world. We have a big stack of articles of him
[13:16.240 --> 13:24.400]  defending burning down US cities. There's that stack. Then there's the Durham investigation,
[13:24.400 --> 13:29.040]  the report of at least 25 more indictments set, and the documents put in the federal
[13:29.040 --> 13:35.360]  filings of private security firms hacking into the White House and, of course, before that,
[13:35.360 --> 13:41.040]  into Trump Tower. And then, of course, US intelligence agencies doing a classic bureaucratic
[13:41.040 --> 13:50.000]  coup over the nation. And then, of course, the biggest news. And I didn't just believe this
[13:50.000 --> 13:53.600]  this morning when I got up at 5 a.m. and saw the Paul Joseph Watson and written an article,
[13:53.600 --> 13:59.840]  which was linked to the national Russian news. I went and looked at local Ukrainian
[13:59.840 --> 14:04.320]  publications and others. And indeed, the Russians pulled back the vast majority of their military.
[14:04.320 --> 14:11.200]  They always have some there on their border, like any nation does. And they've ended their
[14:11.200 --> 14:16.800]  drills, which they have yearly. And Putin said, I told you I'm not invading and laughed at everybody
[14:16.800 --> 14:22.480]  that was fair-mongering. NATO responded by saying, we don't want any military in your country.
[14:22.480 --> 14:27.440]  You can have no military, and you can have no border guards. And I've got the articles saying
[14:27.440 --> 14:31.520]  any military is not allowed. So having military on your own soil of any number
[14:31.520 --> 14:37.840]  is now bad. And it gets worse. The Associated Press and others came out against zero hedge
[14:37.840 --> 14:44.880]  and called for them to be shut down because they linked to Paul Joseph Watson's article about it.
[14:44.880 --> 14:50.640]  So you're not even supposed to say that Russia announced they pulled the troops back,
[14:50.640 --> 14:56.720]  which is now being confirmed by regional media. Okay, all right. Russia nuked the United States
[14:56.720 --> 15:03.840]  last night. We're all dead. I'm actually Casper, the friendly gust. I mean, it's the mind control.
[15:03.840 --> 15:12.320]  I have multiple US newspapers and Canadian papers saying, and colleges, it's time to ban the word
[15:12.320 --> 15:16.640]  freedom. If you tuned in, I'm not joking. They're already banning mother and father. Why not?
[15:19.040 --> 15:24.080]  So there you have Bloomberg wants zero head shut down. And when the corporate media calls for your
[15:24.080 --> 15:33.120]  head to be cut, it is unbelievable. So much more to I mean, we're going to drill into all of this.
[15:34.000 --> 15:38.560]  We are just under global corporate criminal attack or gaslighting everyone. They're trying
[15:38.560 --> 15:42.400]  to start wars everywhere. They've dissolved our borders. They have sold us out to China.
[15:43.040 --> 15:46.800]  And they're sexualizing our children. My God, this is the new world order.
[15:47.840 --> 15:52.160]  And info wars is here in battled, only hanging on because of your prayers,
[15:52.160 --> 15:56.160]  your word of mouth, your financial support. So thank you all for keeping us on air with the red

[17:13.920 --> 17:21.280]  the biggest sale in four years of high quality storeable foods and prepare with Alex.com will end.

[17:43.280 --> 17:50.080]  three, the deep earth, crystal iodine, that sale is going on as well. It doesn't end on Monday,
[17:50.080 --> 17:54.160]  it'll end in a few weeks, and we're almost sold out of the product. Everybody needs to have
[17:54.160 --> 17:58.560]  horrible food to be prepared to become self sufficient down the best high quality food at
[17:58.560 --> 18:05.520]  the lowest prices at info warshore.com. The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc
[18:05.520 --> 18:10.800]  are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life. Info wars has made it easier to make sure
[18:10.800 --> 18:15.600]  you're getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both. This info wars
[18:15.600 --> 18:21.360]  life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase from the info warshore.
[18:21.360 --> 18:26.800]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain
[18:26.800 --> 18:32.880]  the rose plant seeds. Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of
[18:32.880 --> 18:38.480]  health conditions including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies
[18:38.480 --> 18:43.440]  have shown. As for vitamin C and zinc themselves you probably already know that they play an
[18:43.440 --> 18:48.240]  important role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[18:48.240 --> 18:53.600]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations
[18:53.600 --> 18:58.560]  like here in America. So next time you visit be sure to check it out at info warshore.com
[18:58.560 --> 19:05.200]  where we promise our rose hips don't lie. It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had
[19:05.200 --> 19:10.720]  satellites that can decently measure what's happening in the atmosphere. But if you look at
[19:10.720 --> 19:14.240]  all the different studies of the warship on NASA and other governments and other agencies
[19:15.200 --> 19:19.520]  they all disagree on what's really happening with the climate. The only constant, the only great
[19:19.520 --> 19:26.880]  truth is change is the only constant. So yes climate change is totally real but notice first
[19:26.880 --> 19:31.280]  they called it global freezing back in the 70s 80s and then it's gonna be global warming and when
[19:31.280 --> 19:35.680]  that didn't really happen the way they wanted it to. Okay now it's just climate change. But did you
[19:35.680 --> 19:41.680]  know that man-made climate change is a real thing when it comes to the United Nations and the
[19:41.680 --> 19:47.920]  Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN? They have. Weather control trees from 1979. Bill
[19:47.920 --> 19:53.200]  Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time. In fact back in 1994 two scientists
[19:53.200 --> 19:57.680]  won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different particles out of jet engines to control the
[19:57.680 --> 20:04.960]  weather. So yes man-made climate change is real. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the
[20:04.960 --> 20:07.760]  New World Order it's Alex Jones.
[20:23.680 --> 20:27.440]  All right ladies and gentlemen thank you again so much for joining us and caring about the
[20:27.440 --> 20:32.880]  broadcast and caring about free speech and caring about our ability to expose this incredibly
[20:32.880 --> 20:38.480]  evil takeover that is happening by these corporate interests that are completely ruthless and who
[20:38.480 --> 20:45.120]  have now become above the law organizations. Now we have the Declaration of Martial Law and
[20:45.120 --> 20:49.440]  Financial Martial Law in Canada that's coming up. I'm going to host all four hours today.
[20:50.160 --> 20:55.760]  We have the massive Durham bombshells with more information and more reports of imminent
[20:55.760 --> 21:00.640]  indictments and what that really signifies. Tulsi Gabbard said this, the Durham investigation
[21:00.640 --> 21:05.120]  has shown that the biggest threat to our democracy is not some foreign country but rather the power
[21:05.120 --> 21:09.200]  elite led by the likes of Hillary Clinton and her co-conspirators in the mainstream media
[21:09.200 --> 21:14.000]  and security state who work to undermine our democracy from within. I'm about to talk about
[21:14.000 --> 21:20.480]  Hillary Clinton or persecution of yours truly here in just a moment. And of course the huge news
[21:20.480 --> 21:25.200]  on Russia that I'll cover next segment in detail where they are publicly pulling back the troops.
[21:25.200 --> 21:30.480]  It's in the Ukrainian news. The Ukrainian president said that they're pulling back but
[21:30.480 --> 21:34.880]  the corporate media here says no it's not true war is imminent because the West is planning
[21:34.880 --> 21:39.520]  to launch an attack on Russia. Two U.S. senators even said they may nuke Russia first.
[21:41.280 --> 21:48.720]  Deadly dangerous insane bravada and hutzpah that is taking place there ladies and gentlemen.
[21:49.280 --> 21:55.120]  So that is coming up next segment as well. But I first wanted to hit something that deals
[21:55.120 --> 22:00.720]  with free speech not just here but around the world because we don't just see a high tech
[22:00.720 --> 22:09.360]  hack of give and send go redirecting and shutting it down yesterday and the high tech hackers
[22:09.360 --> 22:17.600]  celebrating that they had shut down free speech and the little guy. It was also a major leak
[22:18.160 --> 22:22.880]  of the thousands of people that had donated to the trucker standing up against the permanent
[22:22.880 --> 22:27.200]  biomedical martial law forced injection Nuremberg code violating war crime.
[22:29.840 --> 22:33.120]  And then again I have articles I'm going to show you coming up next segment where
[22:33.120 --> 22:38.800]  mainstream newspapers say freedom is bad. Get rid of freedom. Actually say freedom.
[22:39.520 --> 22:45.280]  Freedom is a right wing racist thing. Freedom is a white thing. And this is vicious central banks
[22:45.280 --> 22:50.960]  that own these newspapers putting out this pure poison. We have to recognize these people for
[22:50.960 --> 22:55.920]  what they are and just fully reject them. And that comes home for us really close because
[22:57.200 --> 23:03.120]  I've learned a lot being sued by the Democratic Party law firm that bankrupted Remington and that
[23:03.120 --> 23:09.680]  openly you know is basically controlled by Senator Blumenthal and others. I've learned a lot about
[23:09.680 --> 23:17.200]  these guys and how things work in the last four years of them suing me and having the controlled
[23:17.200 --> 23:24.560]  courts engage in the type of tactics that they've been engaged in to be stuck between the law firms,
[23:24.560 --> 23:31.040]  the corporate media, the corrupt courts in a triangulation that is a beta test they admit for
[23:31.040 --> 23:36.320]  all Americans that don't completely submit and you know turn our children over to the leftist
[23:36.960 --> 23:43.280]  agenda. So this broke this morning. Sandy Hook families reached 73 million dollar settlement
[23:43.280 --> 23:50.640]  with gun manufacturer Remington bankrupted Remington bankrupted by the lawsuits Supreme
[23:50.640 --> 23:57.520]  Court ruling against them and then it went back to the courts the lower courts and the oldest US
[23:57.520 --> 24:06.240]  firearms manufacturer shut down because Adam Lanza reportedly got a gun from his mother that she
[24:06.240 --> 24:11.200]  had legally that he got illegally and went and shot children and so the CNN reporter cried about
[24:11.200 --> 24:17.280]  that because obviously 73 million isn't enough but the issue is this is the end of the Second
[24:17.280 --> 24:22.720]  Amendment the end of gun manufacturers if this continues this is a major domino to fall and
[24:22.720 --> 24:31.840]  now the same law firm wants my free speech wants me to stop talking about the Second Amendment
[24:32.960 --> 24:40.000]  wants me to roll over to them continuing can read in the Wall Street Journal article
[24:40.000 --> 24:47.440]  about all of this or CNN pick your poison but the very same group
[24:50.720 --> 25:00.720]  has reportedly told the insurer of GCN that they'll settle the lawsuit with me for 500 million
[25:00.720 --> 25:09.040]  dollars that's very funny I don't have five million dollars but that's not really what their goal
[25:09.040 --> 25:16.160]  is they know that their goal is to shut us down and close our doors and take us off air because
[25:16.160 --> 25:20.160]  that's their goal is to take all of your sacred birthright of the First Amendment that's what
[25:20.160 --> 25:26.080]  this is and it's all selective you notice the federal court said Sarah Palin doesn't have a right
[25:26.080 --> 25:30.080]  to sue when they knew the jury was going to rule in her favor when the democrats of the New York
[25:30.080 --> 25:35.120]  Times knowingly put reports out that she put crosshairs over people who were then later shot
[25:35.120 --> 25:42.640]  when it wasn't true premeditated lying that's allowed by the New York Times New York Times
[25:42.640 --> 25:48.560]  versus Sullivan stands but in the Alex Jones case I've been told by the republicans high level
[25:48.560 --> 25:54.000]  who don't like me in Texas the Bush Republicans years ago they said roll over now it's all rig
[25:54.000 --> 25:57.680]  we're actually running this with the Clintons I had a meeting with them right in that room right
[25:57.680 --> 26:02.640]  there yeah four years ago it's off record but I'm when the name names it's off record but I'm not
[26:02.640 --> 26:09.120]  going to do it but push comes to shove who knows right in that room about 30 40 feet away they sat
[26:09.120 --> 26:14.800]  there and told me all this and I understood what was happening there I just said I knew that I had
[26:14.800 --> 26:18.880]  to fight them all the way and just hope America woke up and hope we turn the tide against this
[26:18.880 --> 26:24.560]  takeover and so that's why they put these ridiculous numbers out of we want you to come out against
[26:24.560 --> 26:29.120]  the Second Amendment and we want 500 million dollars what a joke how about you want all the blood
[26:29.120 --> 26:34.080]  out of my body you're not going to get any of that it doesn't exist but but that's what it's
[26:34.080 --> 26:39.760]  all about but they did bankrupt Remington and the Supreme Court did say hey no more gun manufacturers
[26:39.760 --> 26:50.160]  in America that's what this is about is destroying the country from within and I have those enemies
[26:50.160 --> 26:54.480]  the same enemies that the NRA and the Second Amendment and you have and I'm proud to be
[26:54.480 --> 27:00.000]  attacked by these people and I'm proud to not back down when they control the press and the courts
[27:00.000 --> 27:04.880]  and the system and the banks because you're going to learn very fast that you're all in
[27:04.880 --> 27:09.120]  the crosshairs just like Alex Jones as well anybody that's Christian anybody that loves God
[27:09.120 --> 27:13.920]  anybody that's decent anybody that cares about law and order anybody that cares about sovereignty
[27:13.920 --> 27:18.400]  we're being conquered and these people know they're conquering us and they know they're lying
[27:18.400 --> 27:23.760]  and they know they're deceiving and they don't care they love it they're here to break us
[27:23.760 --> 27:30.880]  and absorb us and usurp us that's what they're doing so remember who our enemies are ladies
[27:30.880 --> 27:36.320]  and gentlemen remember you know a man by his enemies you know a man by his friends and our
[27:36.320 --> 27:40.960]  stock is rising and humanity's waking up and we're winning hearts and minds worldwide and the
[27:40.960 --> 27:46.160]  enemy's losing so they're taking their gloves off and putting it to the folks on the front line
[27:46.160 --> 27:51.040]  and a hope we'll curl up and a ball and go away well I'm here in the words of the founder of the
[27:51.040 --> 27:57.520]  U.S. Navy John Paul Jones when he was fighting a ship twice the size with twice the minute a ship
[27:57.520 --> 28:02.080]  was sinking and they held him across on their bullhorn and said you ready to give up and he
[28:02.080 --> 28:09.040]  said I have only begun to fight and he took that ship and won and I have only begun to fight and
[28:09.040 --> 28:15.440]  you can guarantee that we are winning on every front they're discrediting their courts they're
[28:15.440 --> 28:19.440]  discrediting the corporate media they're discrediting their fake agencies they've hijacked
[28:19.440 --> 28:25.760]  they are losing they are going down they'll get all their fake rig garbage and it'll be like a blue
[28:25.760 --> 28:32.720]  ribbon that I won the fair for liberty it'll be like a crown on my head that the people that
[28:32.720 --> 28:38.480]  want to take the police away and disarm us and put Soros DA's in while we're raped and murdered
[28:38.480 --> 28:44.800]  and killed see me as their enemy and see themselves being promoted by the evil witch Hillary Clinton
[28:44.800 --> 28:49.680]  into this program of evil if they could just bring down the Alex Jones when all they ever did was
[28:49.680 --> 28:56.160]  energize me and elevate me in the eyes of the wonderful people of America and the world this
[28:56.160 --> 29:04.960]  is incredibly good news the globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID
[29:04.960 --> 29:12.880]  biomedical tyranny lockdowns until the populations rebelled they would then use that as the pretext
[29:12.880 --> 29:18.880]  for permanent martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives
[29:19.440 --> 29:22.880]  but because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others
[29:23.440 --> 29:29.200]  coming public and and whistleblowers now their whole project is falling apart because the people
[29:29.200 --> 29:36.320]  are aware that it is a world government corporate takeover and so it's pulling back the curtain
[29:36.320 --> 29:41.200]  now more than ever the problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on
[29:41.200 --> 29:48.080]  their takeover like canada but they've now declared a civil emergency and martial law in Ontario
[29:48.080 --> 29:53.040]  and other areas of the world are following suit like australia so pray for these folks big time
[29:53.040 --> 29:58.240]  this is a very serious situation and stay tuned into info wars dot com because truth is absolutely
[29:58.240 --> 30:14.160]  bare mouth from the words of chuck polemics fight club dear globalist leaders of the great reset
[30:14.160 --> 30:19.680]  the people you're trying to step on we're everyone you depend on we're the people who do your laundry

[30:37.440 --> 30:43.040]  your life we are the middle children of history raised by television to believe that someday
[30:43.040 --> 30:50.080]  we'll be millionaires and movie stars but we won't and we're just learning this fact so don't
[30:50.080 --> 30:56.480]  with us support independent media and info war store com
[30:59.200 --> 31:04.320]  with all the craziness going on in the world with the globalist plotting their next big
[31:04.320 --> 31:10.400]  lockdown with the next phase of the great reset being a stage cyber attack with the deep state
[31:10.400 --> 31:17.520]  pushing a civil war not just here but in europe and war with russia with the massive inflation
[31:17.520 --> 31:22.880]  and all the other garbage that's taking place like supply chain right now you need to get
[31:22.880 --> 31:29.200]  prepared now with high quality storeable food that is ready to ship and it's been four years
[31:29.200 --> 31:36.480]  since my patriot supply at preparewithalex.com has offered their storeable food at 25 off
[31:36.480 --> 31:44.160]  four years but right now it's 25 off until february 13th 2022 a little over two weeks
[31:44.160 --> 31:51.040]  from the time i'm cutting this to get 25 off and prepare with alex.com on the entire catalog
[31:51.040 --> 31:56.800]  of my patriot supply act now get prepared now this is absolutely essential for everybody
[31:56.800 --> 32:01.760]  that wants to be self-sufficient micah california thanks for calling i think we're barking up the
[32:01.760 --> 32:07.920]  wrong tree calling this gain of function research now if you read the actual you know 2014 legislation
[32:07.920 --> 32:14.160]  the u.s government gain of function deliberative process and research funding pause on selected
[32:14.160 --> 32:18.640]  gain of function research involving influenza mers and stars viruses there's nothing about
[32:18.640 --> 32:24.400]  stars like viruses and it's a research funding pause it's not a stop it's not a prohibition it's
[32:24.400 --> 32:28.560]  when you come to a four-way intersection there's the stop sign you stop you look both ways and
[32:28.560 --> 32:34.000]  then you proceed and so it's also it doesn't pause all gain of function just selected gain of function
[32:34.000 --> 32:38.880]  but they'll argue that this is actually characterization and qualification research so
[32:38.880 --> 32:42.480]  you know rand and others you know maybe fouchy was right they don't quite know what they're
[32:42.480 --> 32:46.160]  talking about calling it gain of function you know that's why he didn't perjure himself that's
[32:46.160 --> 32:50.320]  why he hasn't been arrested because they're literally creating new synthetic life forms that
[32:50.320 --> 32:54.960]  mimic what the viruses do but in the main definition it's still a gain of function you're
[32:54.960 --> 32:58.720]  making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people thank you mike we love you
[32:58.720 --> 33:06.720]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[33:06.720 --> 33:30.800]  live from austin texas it's alex jones
[33:30.800 --> 33:38.640]  if you go to the live show headline on the vaunted info wars dot com hated by tyrants and
[33:38.640 --> 33:45.280]  criminals everywhere emergency tuesday broadcast russia withdraws troops from ukraine border as
[33:45.280 --> 33:54.000]  nato continues to declare full-scale war is imminent meanwhile in canada trudeau has declared a
[33:54.000 --> 34:03.600]  national emergency and financial martial law and is awakening the world to the threat of the global
[34:03.600 --> 34:10.880]  social credit score police state also alex jones breaks down exclusive intel on the durham case
[34:11.520 --> 34:18.560]  and how it shows the deep state has overthrown the u.s. government and that's why these people are so
[34:18.560 --> 34:24.720]  arrogant they believe they are invincible like all other tyrants throughout history but the
[34:24.720 --> 34:31.040]  u.s. background says they will not win in the end and if history repeats itself they're going to be
[34:31.040 --> 34:37.280]  going to prison i just want them to stop their criminal takeover using behavioral psychology
[34:37.280 --> 34:46.320]  and economic warfare now i'm going to go over the declaration of national emergency and financial
[34:46.320 --> 34:53.520]  martial law that's not just me saying that that is major members of parliament who happen to be
[34:53.520 --> 35:01.840]  liberals in trudeau's own caucus and the civil liberties union of canada says this is just
[35:01.840 --> 35:06.880]  unprecedented north korea type behavior and of course it's going to be expanded on to everyone
[35:06.880 --> 35:11.920]  what did i tell you was coming next is the global the global social credit score is that plan that's
[35:11.920 --> 35:17.360]  what trudeau admits he wanted so they put people in an impossible position they stand up peacefully
[35:17.360 --> 35:21.440]  and say we're not taking in our bodies your experimental deadly shop that doesn't protect us
[35:21.440 --> 35:27.520]  and makes us sick in many cases and that you want to track us and control us with no more medical
[35:27.520 --> 35:34.800]  privacy and his response is to say i'm calling the military out on you and we're going to take over
[35:34.800 --> 35:42.400]  your bank accounts and so much more so you saw bill mar join the right side of history last week we
[35:42.400 --> 35:48.480]  he said on friday we played on the saturday and sunday shows here that trudeau has become hitler
[35:48.480 --> 35:54.800]  trudeau is being hitler like in his quotes i want a dictatorship i don't care if you have
[35:54.800 --> 35:57.600]  rights we're going to go ahead and take them you're holding unacceptable views
[35:57.600 --> 36:04.000]  what are we going to do with all these unvaccinated people taking up space
[36:06.800 --> 36:11.920]  that's what's going on so here's a short compilation that we just put together this morning
[36:11.920 --> 36:18.240]  just a just a sampling of some of what he said in the past and then his draconian declaration
[36:18.240 --> 36:29.120]  last night here it is
[36:29.120 --> 36:36.880]  the small fringe minority of people who are on their way to ottawa or who are
[36:37.840 --> 36:41.920]  holding unacceptable views that they're expressing
[36:41.920 --> 36:50.080]  do not represent the views of canadiens who have been there for each other who know
[36:50.880 --> 36:57.680]  that following the science and stepping up to protect each other is the best way to continue
[36:57.680 --> 37:05.840]  to ensure our freedoms our rights our values as a country we are not intimidated by those who hurl
[37:05.840 --> 37:14.000]  insults and abuse at small business workers and steal food from the homeless we won't give in
[37:14.720 --> 37:23.680]  to those who fly racist flags we won't cave to those who engage in vandalism or dishonor the
[37:23.680 --> 37:30.880]  memory of our veterans so to those responsible for this behavior it needs to stop the level of
[37:30.880 --> 37:40.880]  of admiration i actually have for china um because their basic dictatorship is allowing them
[37:41.680 --> 37:46.080]  to actually turn their economy around on a dime and say we need to go green as fast as we need to
[37:46.080 --> 37:51.280]  start you know investing in solar i'll be there is a flexibility that i know steven harper must
[37:51.280 --> 37:56.320]  dream about of having a dictatorship that he could do everything he wanted uh that i find quite
[37:56.320 --> 38:03.760]  interesting regardless of the fact that we are attacking your fundamental rights or limiting
[38:03.760 --> 38:10.320]  your fundamental rights and the charter says that we're wrong we're still going to go ahead and do
[38:10.320 --> 38:18.400]  with it the federal government has invoked the emergencies act to supplement provincial and
[38:18.400 --> 38:25.520]  territorial capacity to address the blockades and occupations we are broadening the scope of
[38:25.520 --> 38:33.200]  canada's anti-money laundering and terrorist financing rules so that they cover crowd funding
[38:33.200 --> 38:41.280]  platforms and the payment service providers they use these changes cover all forms of transactions
[38:42.080 --> 38:50.480]  including digital assets such as cryptocurrencies i want to be very clear the scope of these measures
[38:50.480 --> 39:01.040]  will be time limited geographically targeted as well as reasonable and proportionate to the threats
[39:01.040 --> 39:08.240]  they are meant to address the emergencies act will be used to strengthen and support law enforcement
[39:08.240 --> 39:16.480]  agencies at all levels across the country this is about keeping canadians safe protecting
[39:16.480 --> 39:25.440]  people's jobs and restoring confidence in our institutions as of today a bank or other financial
[39:25.440 --> 39:34.320]  service provider will be able to immediately freeze or suspend an account without a court order
[39:34.320 --> 39:40.560]  just in chateau i mean i thought he was kind of a cool guy and i started to read what he said this
[39:40.560 --> 39:45.600]  is a couple of weeks ago he was or maybe this is september but he was talking about people who are
[39:45.600 --> 39:51.520]  not vaccinated he said they don't believe in science they're often misogynistic often racist
[39:51.520 --> 39:56.400]  no they're not that was not that right he said but they take up space
[39:57.680 --> 40:03.440]  and with that we have to make a choice in terms of a leader as a country do we tolerate these people
[40:03.440 --> 40:09.920]  it's like tolerate you now you do sound like him all of you that signed on to hillary and the
[40:09.920 --> 40:15.840]  democrats and the debos group which is the bill deberg group you've signed on to pure evil and
[40:15.840 --> 40:21.440]  you better understand you're going down you can try to take our free speech take our guns take our
[40:21.440 --> 40:27.360]  children all you're doing is waking us up and getting us off the fence but they're out there
[40:27.360 --> 40:31.520]  folks and they've made their decisions that they are at war with all of us i'm going to come back
[40:31.520 --> 40:35.200]  and hit more of this and the huge russian news the huge durum news i'm doing all four hours
[40:35.200 --> 40:41.440]  they were going to open the phones up in the second and third hour take a lot of calls separately
[40:43.680 --> 40:50.160]  we are fighting the new world order at point blank range i am absolutely going up against the
[40:50.160 --> 40:55.520]  worst people at every level and it's only been your prayers and your support that's kept us on
[40:55.520 --> 41:02.400]  air and so i'm telling you now we have reached the thick of the battle we have reached the heart of
[41:02.400 --> 41:09.600]  the war we are entering the most important phase of the war against tyranny and fighting back against
[41:09.600 --> 41:17.200]  their unrestricted undeclared war against us and so i need capital now more than ever for what you

[47:04.000 --> 47:10.720]  new world order it's alex jones
[47:16.480 --> 47:21.200]  well that was an incredibly powerful three and a half minute video that darin Mcbrain put together
[47:22.800 --> 47:26.160]  and he could have made it an hour long of trudeau making dictator comments
[47:26.160 --> 47:34.480]  and smacking his lips and looking like a satanic jack-o-lantern we had trudeau's brother on last
[47:34.480 --> 47:39.680]  week and we should probably get him back on sometime the next few days because this declaration
[47:39.680 --> 47:44.400]  of martial law and financial martial law is incredible by the way when the normal law is
[47:44.400 --> 47:50.320]  suspended and private corporations are commanded and given federal power that's one of the most
[47:50.320 --> 47:58.000]  extreme forms of martial law that is the suspension of the checks and balances for the people
[47:59.280 --> 48:08.640]  and trudeau has declared martial law unbelievable and i literally have 15 20 clips i mean that are
[48:08.640 --> 48:13.040]  all just them foaming at the mouth and how we're going to send the military in and how we're going
[48:13.040 --> 48:17.280]  to take everything you've got and we're going to expand this now to anybody else protesting around
[48:17.280 --> 48:21.680]  the country and then i've got other government ministers saying this is good we can't let people
[48:21.680 --> 48:27.920]  gather and talk they'll hear information that's not official that's a quote and you're like that
[48:27.920 --> 48:39.520]  sounds like kim jong un yeah yeah i mean this is tax book bs and of course there's all these
[48:39.520 --> 48:44.960]  fools on the left that think they're going to be protecting and be part of this the immoral
[48:44.960 --> 48:50.240]  out of control godless left has made its move against humanity backed by the most ruthless
[48:50.240 --> 48:56.320]  vicious corporations big ruthless corporations found their minions that would take their 20
[48:56.320 --> 49:00.080]  pieces of silver so let me just show you some headlines here and then later in the next hour
[49:00.080 --> 49:03.440]  i want to get into russia i want to get into the derma investigation big i got exclusive
[49:04.640 --> 49:09.360]  information on that by the way i mean it's sometimes i just marvel all the connections we've
[49:09.360 --> 49:15.360]  got god put us in this place i get more humble as our influence increases but i mean
[49:18.960 --> 49:24.560]  i know more than most us senators i'm dialed into basically all the good guys and it's been
[49:24.560 --> 49:31.360]  because i've been on air 28 years and i've been trained by the position that god put me in and
[49:31.360 --> 49:37.600]  all glory goes to god but it is amazing and it's very very daunting and i don't feel worthy
[49:37.600 --> 49:43.440]  but i do need to tell the listeners that you financing and your word of mouth and your prayer
[49:44.000 --> 49:50.320]  you betting on this operation has changed the damn world for the better in a big way
[49:51.120 --> 49:54.880]  i mean i'm going to just be point like whether in everybody knows this now it's not something
[49:54.880 --> 50:00.160]  that's that's exaggerating without info wars we'd be in a lot worse shape and we have turned the
[50:00.160 --> 50:05.120]  tide at least in the awakening doesn't mean we're going to win the war in this phase but
[50:05.120 --> 50:10.720]  we have turned the tide this broadcast all of us together we have done it
[50:12.800 --> 50:19.280]  and that's recognized by all the who's who's folks us senators joe rogan
[50:19.920 --> 50:24.880]  tucker carlson and the list goes on and on and so i've been persecuted i've been attacked
[50:25.760 --> 50:30.560]  you know 10 of the stuff's been done to us folks and i'm not a victim i'm not whining here i'm
[50:30.560 --> 50:34.240]  actually proud of it and when stuff hurts and stuff's horrible and stuff's embarrassing and
[50:34.240 --> 50:39.760]  stuff's painful i just go well you asked for this you asked god to set you up to fight evil you asked
[50:39.760 --> 50:45.440]  for it you got it that's exactly what i intend to do i'm never backing down to these people because
[50:45.440 --> 50:51.200]  now i would have never given up even if we were going to lose because god is testing us and we're
[50:51.200 --> 50:58.320]  eternal and this is just a battle not the war but we in our own lifetimes can see beautiful people
[50:58.320 --> 51:03.360]  of every race color and creed coming together and seeing through the most vile corrupt oppressive
[51:03.360 --> 51:10.640]  brainwashing and satanic lies that this planet has ever seen because make no mistake ladies and
[51:10.640 --> 51:17.040]  gentlemen we are toe to toe with the fallen one the old serpent the devil so look at these headlines
[51:17.840 --> 51:22.640]  look at these headlines freedom convoy organizers say they notify police are being told nefarious
[51:22.640 --> 51:26.960]  elements plan to discredit the protest exactly first they declare the civil emergency then they
[51:26.960 --> 51:31.760]  declare you terrorist then they make you the terrorist here is the actual declaration of
[51:31.760 --> 51:37.200]  martial law in english and in french you should go read it for yourself it's linked on info wars.com
[51:39.520 --> 51:45.040]  trudeau unleashes never before he used emergency powers act to counter protesters as us canada
[51:45.040 --> 51:52.400]  bridge reopens martial law trudeau government invokes terrorism laws close quote to seek bank
[51:52.400 --> 51:59.120]  accounts and crypto of freedom convoy supporters without court order he is now judge jury and
[51:59.120 --> 52:05.200]  executioners and all of his appointed leftists are free to take any action they wish against you
[52:08.480 --> 52:13.120]  remember anybody that flew to dc of a million people trying to fly back out
[52:14.320 --> 52:17.840]  some drove some flew with hundreds of thousands of flew weren't even at the capital
[52:18.400 --> 52:23.520]  some people were just in dc on business they were put on no fly list just because they were in dc
[52:23.520 --> 52:33.520]  by the air companies by the american airlines and united airlines airlines that's how fascism
[52:33.520 --> 52:37.920]  and communism works is all the minions attack you and then they're above the law with the

[53:44.080 --> 53:49.120]  dollar judgment on remington when the guy's mom went and bought the gun totally legally and he
[53:49.120 --> 53:54.160]  goes and shoots people and then it's all gun owners fault and now it's all gun manufacturers fault

[54:19.200 --> 54:25.440]  don't want me up here running my mouth about what they're doing oh but look why justin trudeau
[54:25.440 --> 54:30.080]  is supporting protesting farmers in india india tried to restrict the farmers that didn't want
[54:30.080 --> 54:34.800]  to go on a national id program i agree with them he he he supported that just so he could look good
[54:34.800 --> 54:43.920]  but he doesn't support his own people in fact he did it under the orders of claus schwaab and
[54:44.640 --> 54:51.840]  biden it's now coming up trudeau's state media though labels freedom a far right concept well
[54:51.840 --> 54:57.120]  that's so incredible freedom's a slippery concept towards washington university professor says

[55:28.800 --> 55:34.480]  introducing the emergencies act due to the part the truckers expressions of hate oh yeah somebody
[55:34.480 --> 55:39.920]  had a sign of trudeau the swastika on trudeau saying he's a nazi you know like bill mar and so

[55:45.280 --> 55:51.120]  marshal law in california because bill mar said somebody's like a nazi see how it works oh bill

[56:16.080 --> 56:21.840]  superior to you it's how they take the grandchildren of world war two vets that almost died fighting
[56:21.840 --> 56:26.480]  hitler and they turn you into hitler while they give awards to people that served hitler like george
[56:26.480 --> 56:33.840]  soros because they're evil people and it just goes on and on and on tech companies banks crack down

[1:00:18.240 --> 1:00:24.400]  well we got good news the russians have completed their main drills and have pulled back their
[1:00:24.400 --> 1:00:29.840]  main military force from their own border with ukraine we have peter Lancaster a big
[1:00:29.840 --> 1:00:35.520]  internationally known reporter joining us coming up in the next segment to lay out the latest
[1:00:36.160 --> 1:00:42.800]  on that and there are crazy ap articles bloomberg articles you name it demonizing zero heads for
[1:00:42.800 --> 1:00:49.760]  amongst things linking to paul joseph watson linking to russian propaganda so when we report
[1:00:50.320 --> 1:00:54.720]  that russia says they pulled their trips back we're not allowed to just like when
[1:00:54.720 --> 1:00:58.880]  qualmo said on cnn you're not allowed to re wiki leaks only cnn can remember that
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:06.320]  remember how bizarre that was remember how crazy that was and so now if we just report that russia
[1:01:06.320 --> 1:01:10.080]  says they pulled back i mean i guess if we report kim jong-un says the sky's blue we're not allowed to
[1:01:10.080 --> 1:01:15.520]  say it no you only report corporate media that tells you we're at war with russia
[1:01:15.520 --> 1:01:21.280]  and the war is imminent this is so powerful i'm gonna play it one more time here's a compilation
[1:01:21.280 --> 1:01:25.840]  of turdo and all of his tyrannical announcements and behavior here it is we'll be right back with a
[1:01:25.840 --> 1:01:44.400]  special guest the small fringe minority of people who are on their way to ottawa or who are uh
[1:01:44.400 --> 1:01:54.000]  holding unacceptable uh views uh that they're expressing do not represent the views of canadians
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:02:01.440]  who have been there for each other who know the following the science and stepping up to protect
[1:02:01.440 --> 1:02:08.320]  each other is the best way to continue to ensure our freedoms our rights our values as a country
[1:02:08.320 --> 1:02:15.280]  we are not intimidated by those who hurl insults and abuse at small business workers
[1:02:15.280 --> 1:02:25.600]  and steal food from the homeless we won't give in to those who fly racist flags we won't cave
[1:02:26.720 --> 1:02:33.440]  to those who engage in vandalism or dishonor the memory of our veterans so to those responsible
[1:02:33.440 --> 1:02:40.800]  for this behavior it needs to stop the level of of uh admiration i actually have for china
[1:02:40.800 --> 1:02:50.000]  um because their basic dictatorship is allowing them uh to actually turn their economy around
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:54.960]  on a dime and say we need to go green as fastest we need to start you know investing in solar i'll
[1:02:54.960 --> 1:02:59.520]  be there is a flexibility that i know steven harper must dream about of having a dictatorship
[1:02:59.520 --> 1:03:05.360]  that he could do everything he wanted uh that i find quite interesting regardless of the fact
[1:03:05.360 --> 1:03:11.520]  that we are attacking your fundamental rights or limiting your fundamental rights
[1:03:12.800 --> 1:03:18.400]  and the charter says that we're wrong we're still going to go ahead and do with it the federal
[1:03:18.400 --> 1:03:26.320]  government has invoked the emergencies act to supplement provincial and territorial capacity
[1:03:26.880 --> 1:03:32.720]  to address the blockades and occupations we are broadening the scope of canada's
[1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:40.480]  anti-money laundering and terrorist financing rules so that they cover crowd funding platforms
[1:03:41.040 --> 1:03:47.840]  and the payment service providers they use these changes cover all forms of transactions
[1:03:48.640 --> 1:03:57.120]  including digital assets such as cryptocurrencies i want to be very clear the scope of these measures
[1:03:57.120 --> 1:04:06.160]  will be time limited geographically targeted as well as reasonable and proportionate
[1:04:06.880 --> 1:04:13.200]  to the threats they are meant to address the emergencies act will be used to strengthen
[1:04:13.200 --> 1:04:20.560]  and support law enforcement agencies at all levels across the country this is about keeping
[1:04:20.560 --> 1:04:29.280]  canadians safe protecting people's jobs and restoring confidence in our institutions as of today
[1:04:30.240 --> 1:04:38.480]  a bank or other financial service provider will be able to immediately freeze or suspend an account
[1:04:39.040 --> 1:04:44.240]  without a court order just in general i mean i thought he was kind of a cool guy
[1:04:44.240 --> 1:04:49.600]  then i started to read what he said this is a couple of weeks ago he was or maybe this is

[1:06:29.120 --> 1:06:37.280]  but russia has pulled its troops off of its own border with ukraine it does once a year drills
[1:06:37.280 --> 1:06:41.280]  and they said these are just drills you're the ones massing troops and weapons in ukraine in
[1:06:41.280 --> 1:06:45.680]  nato we heard three weeks ago war was imminent we heard two weeks ago a week ago then we were told
[1:06:45.680 --> 1:06:51.360]  over the weekend it was going to happen on the 16th tomorrow and then the president of ukraine
[1:06:51.360 --> 1:06:57.040]  came out and said that's not true uh please joe biden come here to america then he was sarcastic
[1:06:57.040 --> 1:07:02.240]  and said okay i guess the invasion is the 16th two days ago our media ran with that like it was
[1:07:02.240 --> 1:07:08.000]  serious well now the russians have pulled back from their already scheduled drills and what is the
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:15.760]  response of the corporate media here in the west uh that putin's not allowed to have any troops
[1:07:15.760 --> 1:07:21.760]  anywhere in russia the russians aren't allowed to even have a military and you know how dare
[1:07:22.560 --> 1:07:27.920]  russia put itself close to all of the west military bases literally we'll believe putin's
[1:07:27.920 --> 1:07:35.600]  withdrawal when we see it nato cautiously declares a victory oh it's a victory that they had a
[1:07:35.600 --> 1:07:40.560]  military drill and ended it invading ukraine so we'll believe putin's withdrawal when we see it
[1:07:40.560 --> 1:07:48.320]  nato cautiously declares victory in the battle oh to stop russia invading ukraine while Moscow
[1:07:48.320 --> 1:07:54.800]  claims it has disgraced the west hours after u.s intelligence warned troops were in attack positions
[1:07:54.800 --> 1:08:00.480]  the same u.s intelligence that told us that trump and alex jones were russian agents i can tell you
[1:08:00.480 --> 1:08:06.000]  i'm not i can tell you trump isn't roger stone the same ones that's spied illegally on trump's
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:10.800]  campaign and then on the white house that's treason that's illegal that's felony that's
[1:08:10.800 --> 1:08:15.200]  punishable by life in the super max prison quite frankly it's punishable by death under us code
[1:08:15.840 --> 1:08:20.400]  but oh my gosh then it's hillary on the payroll of anybody that'll give her money around the world
[1:08:20.400 --> 1:08:26.160]  she didn't work for the russians or the chinese or anybody she works against america so that is
[1:08:26.160 --> 1:08:34.720]  just absolutely amazing peter or patrick i said peter earlier patrick landcaster is our guest and

[1:09:07.680 --> 1:09:13.760]  so patrick landcaster independent journalist uh in one of the eastern controlled areas by russia
[1:09:13.760 --> 1:09:17.840]  so much to talk about so much to break down i know it's evening over there thank you so much for
[1:09:17.840 --> 1:09:24.160]  coming on no problem alex thanks for having me so patrick where do you want to start here
[1:09:24.720 --> 1:09:32.000]  is it true that the russians are pulling back or is that a lie well this morning in russia
[1:09:32.720 --> 1:09:40.560]  the ministry of defense announced that their exercises were coming to an end as planned and
[1:09:40.560 --> 1:09:52.080]  as they said and released footage of their forces withdrawing from near the ukraine border
[1:09:52.960 --> 1:10:01.120]  they worded it as their exercises in the southwestern regions of russia were coming to an end
[1:10:01.120 --> 1:10:09.120]  and this is clearly they're referring to the forces near the ukraine border and as you said
[1:10:09.120 --> 1:10:15.040]  the west is claiming this is something that they caused to happen even though this was planned
[1:10:15.040 --> 1:10:24.480]  russia never said there was going to be a invasion even ukraine denied that russia was going to be
[1:10:24.480 --> 1:10:31.520]  invading but the western mainstream media and the western powers has kept pushing this narrative
[1:10:31.520 --> 1:10:40.480]  to the people just to fit their agenda and the people here on the ground in dunyesk were never
[1:10:40.480 --> 1:10:45.520]  afraid that there was going to be a russian invasion they were more afraid there was going to be a
[1:10:45.520 --> 1:10:52.880]  ukrainian invasion of this territory because that's how the people feel here in 2014 the locals
[1:10:52.880 --> 1:10:58.960]  here at dunyesk and northern breakaway area the lukansk people's republic voted to break
[1:10:58.960 --> 1:11:07.840]  away from ukraine and then the ukraine war which is almost going to the eight year mark now so
[1:11:07.840 --> 1:11:13.360]  it's just been something that's been being pushed by the western mainstream media that the big bad
[1:11:13.360 --> 1:11:20.800]  russia was going to invade one in reality that was never going to happen now i've followed this
[1:11:20.800 --> 1:11:25.760]  but not like you have obviously right in the middle of it explain to people the geographic area why
[1:11:25.760 --> 1:11:30.960]  this started and the fact that there's been at least what 14 000 people killed in those eastern
[1:11:30.960 --> 1:11:37.600]  areas over disputes between ukraine and russia in that zone that's historically been been russian
[1:11:37.600 --> 1:11:42.720]  is that accurate to say and i've seen the blown-up houses and power plants and businesses and mysterious
[1:11:42.720 --> 1:11:51.360]  explosions and missile attacks and both sides saying it's the other well i've been here basically
[1:11:51.360 --> 1:12:02.720]  the entire eight years of this war and this war started in 2014 after the revolution in kiev
[1:12:02.720 --> 1:12:10.000]  which removed the standing president janikovic which the local population here in dunvas
[1:12:11.120 --> 1:12:17.200]  felt was their president and when that president was removed they felt their ukraine the ukraine
[1:12:17.200 --> 1:12:24.240]  they loved and was part of was dead in this new zombie ukraine was put into power and i was also
[1:12:24.240 --> 1:12:31.280]  down in Crimea just after the whole events in Maidan when the Crimean referendum happened
[1:12:31.280 --> 1:12:37.920]  and the western media was portraying that as russia trying to making the population
[1:12:37.920 --> 1:12:45.680]  votes to break away from Ukraine when in reality the local population of Crimea was happy to go
[1:12:45.680 --> 1:12:54.480]  back to russia and following the when Crimea was a part of russia again the population here in
[1:12:54.480 --> 1:13:01.120]  danieckin lugans they had their own referendum to break away from ukraine with the hopes that
[1:13:01.120 --> 1:13:09.200]  russia was going to take them in to russia as they did a Crimea no that didn't quite happen
[1:13:09.200 --> 1:13:14.160]  as we all know and there's been eight years of war after this but after the referendum here in
[1:13:14.160 --> 1:13:23.120]  danieckin lugans the population made borders started creating a military and ukraine basically
[1:13:23.120 --> 1:13:30.000]  punished them for this and i have shown thousands of reports where ukraine has indiscriminately
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:36.880]  shelled civilian neighborhoods civilian homes i have seen this with my own eyes proven it over
[1:13:36.880 --> 1:13:45.040]  and over again of ukraine shelling civilian areas with no interest on how it affects
[1:13:45.840 --> 1:13:52.960]  the civilian population and i've interviewed so many civilians here that just wants to be part
[1:13:52.960 --> 1:14:02.880]  of russia again and some want to be independent and today the state duma of russia sent a
[1:14:02.880 --> 1:14:11.120]  recommendation request to the president of vladimir putin to recognize the republics of
[1:14:11.120 --> 1:14:18.320]  danieckin lugans people's republic as independence the country and independent journalist patrick
[1:14:18.320 --> 1:14:22.000]  landcaster stay there we got to go to break it about a minute and i wanted this is all very
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:25.760]  important i asked the question but getting back to the central point the russians announced
[1:14:25.760 --> 1:14:30.400]  their withdrawing their drill they have those i know i've read every year clearly nato was trying
[1:14:30.400 --> 1:14:35.200]  to hype some type of provocation but now russia by completely pulling back it looks like maybe a
[1:14:35.200 --> 1:14:40.880]  little bit early in their drills this is really again discredited the west that's been saying war
[1:14:40.880 --> 1:14:46.240]  is imminent for the last three weeks every day why do you think nato was saying this and doing
[1:14:46.240 --> 1:14:50.640]  this what what is the point of discrediting themselves over and over again saying a russian
[1:14:50.640 --> 1:15:01.040]  invasion is imminent well they almost every year something along these lines happen where the west
[1:15:01.040 --> 1:15:10.640]  blames russia for creating a possible escalation in this conflict when in reality ukraine forces
[1:15:10.640 --> 1:15:17.200]  are the ones that do not follow the minxed agreements which is supposed to be uh to help
[1:15:17.200 --> 1:15:23.040]  the local population here and bring it into this war but on a daily basis weekly basis
[1:15:23.040 --> 1:15:29.440]  ukraine continues to attack the civilian population and infrastructure of done boss the republic
[1:15:29.440 --> 1:15:34.160]  and by the way that's not debated we're showing footage you shot and others have shot of just
[1:15:34.160 --> 1:15:38.480]  devastated areas i want to come back and talk about the devastation in eastern ukraine on the
[1:15:38.480 --> 1:15:43.280]  border with russia and what this western proxy war has done in the past and where you think they're
[1:15:43.280 --> 1:15:48.800]  going in the future uh now that putin has done his thrill in case they try to uh uh to take
[1:15:48.800 --> 1:15:53.120]  over those russian areas and and what the west will do now that he's de-escalated stay with us
[1:15:58.560 --> 1:16:04.160]  anything of real quality anything of lasting durability anything that's really satisfying
[1:16:04.160 --> 1:16:10.960]  empowering and fulfilling it's going to be hard to attain and when it comes to information boy is
[1:16:10.960 --> 1:16:18.400]  that true today we see the entire global corrupt into a human depopulation great recent combine
[1:16:18.960 --> 1:16:24.400]  trying to collapse our society to build on its ashes their their transhumanist nightmare vision
[1:16:25.120 --> 1:16:31.040]  suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and
[1:16:31.040 --> 1:16:38.080]  engineers that are exposing all their lives their coveted hysteria their world's gonna end in 2030
[1:16:38.080 --> 1:16:44.480]  carbon tax global warming bull all of it and none of it can succeed none of it can actually be
[1:16:44.480 --> 1:16:50.720]  carried out unless everybody is silenced and gaslit that's why truth comes with hard work
[1:16:50.720 --> 1:16:54.800]  and with research and with diligence and that's why it's hard to share in full wars links and
[1:16:54.800 --> 1:17:07.120]  band up video links that's why we've got to share them now more than ever from the words of chuck

[1:19:11.040 --> 1:19:17.200]  cases actually taking people away into the night to their facilities and they're planning in the
[1:19:17.200 --> 1:19:22.800]  next year to expand their shield process where they come and take quote healthy people away
[1:19:22.800 --> 1:19:27.440]  and put them in facilities for their safety this is nothing less than martial law and one big thing
[1:19:27.440 --> 1:19:32.560]  you can do to fight back is to get high quality faraday cages many of which are made here in america
[1:19:32.560 --> 1:19:38.240]  and are very compliant meaning us government military grade at info war store dot com we have

[1:20:02.080 --> 1:20:15.760]  the new world order it's alex jones you have said talked a lot about security guarantees and now
[1:20:15.760 --> 1:20:22.560]  we've seen your proposals you also say you have no intention of invading ukraine so will you guarantee
[1:20:22.560 --> 1:20:28.240]  unconditionally that you will not invade ukraine or any other sovereign country or does that depend
[1:20:28.240 --> 1:20:35.200]  on how negotiations go and another question what is it do you think that the west does not understand
[1:20:35.200 --> 1:20:47.280]  about russia or about your intentions thank you speaking of the security guarantees and what it
[1:20:47.280 --> 1:20:53.440]  will depend upon or if something will depend upon the negotiations our actions will not depend on
[1:20:53.440 --> 1:20:59.600]  the negotiation they will depend on the unconditional compliance with the russian security demands today
[1:20:59.600 --> 1:21:05.600]  and in historical context in this sense we have made it clear that any further NATO movement to
[1:21:05.600 --> 1:21:13.680]  the east is unacceptable there is nothing unclear about this we are not deploying our missiles over
[1:21:13.680 --> 1:21:19.600]  at the borders of the u.s. no on the other hand the u.s. is deploying its missiles close to our
[1:21:19.600 --> 1:21:28.880]  home on there on the porch of our house so are we demanding something excessive we're simply
[1:21:28.880 --> 1:21:35.200]  asking them not to deploy their tax systems over at our home what is so unusual or peculiar about
[1:21:35.200 --> 1:21:44.560]  that so what would the americans think if we for example decided to come to the border between
[1:21:44.560 --> 1:21:53.120]  say canada and the united states or mexico and simply deploy our missiles over there well
[1:21:53.120 --> 1:21:59.280]  it doesn't have did mexico in the u.s. never have any territorial disputes what about california
[1:21:59.280 --> 1:22:05.200]  what about texas did you forget about that but everything seems to have come down nobody
[1:22:05.200 --> 1:22:10.720]  remembers those things just like the way they remember about Crimea we try not to remember
[1:22:15.360 --> 1:22:20.560]  the awakening is incredible that's taking place right now patrick Lancaster is an amazing
[1:22:20.560 --> 1:22:25.120]  reporter that has literally shot thousands of in the street in the field films many of which
[1:22:25.120 --> 1:22:35.200]  we've aired here and watched as soon as i saw this latest announcement by the russians that
[1:22:35.200 --> 1:22:38.800]  they're going to end their drills i knew the media would just say it wasn't true because that's what
[1:22:38.800 --> 1:22:44.400]  they do folks they gaslight is so patrick where do you see this going next because clearly
[1:22:44.400 --> 1:22:49.520]  biden's in trouble everybody's waking up to him he's got like a 30 percent or lower approval rating
[1:22:49.520 --> 1:22:54.160]  and now their whole coveted power grab is falling apart what are they going to do well
[1:22:54.160 --> 1:22:57.760]  when you lose control start a war if you're an authoritarian group justin trudeau has
[1:22:57.760 --> 1:23:05.200]  declared martial law in canada uh where do you see the west going now that it's run by these
[1:23:05.200 --> 1:23:10.080]  psychotics and how do you see russia responding when it's shown incredible restraint to five
[1:23:10.080 --> 1:23:15.440]  nato expansions i just played part of a putin interview that i'm going to air all of in the
[1:23:15.440 --> 1:23:21.120]  last 30 minutes of the show today where it's all so reasonable and real not because i'm a
[1:23:21.120 --> 1:23:26.640]  putin follower but because i've studied all the angles and i know he's being very real very
[1:23:26.640 --> 1:23:31.280]  straightforward with people and then our media tell us that he's the second coming of hitler
[1:23:31.280 --> 1:23:35.600]  but then meanwhile a guy that actually worked for hitler george soros brags that he helped
[1:23:35.600 --> 1:23:46.800]  overthrow ukraine eight years ago on cnn with ferreza karya well i think there is quite a few
[1:23:46.800 --> 1:23:54.880]  different possibilities for the near future here and it does depend on how the western powers
[1:23:54.880 --> 1:24:05.040]  and russia will react i think the next trigger might be the fact that right now it's on the
[1:24:05.040 --> 1:24:12.320]  books and in uh putin's hands whether russia is going to recognize the republics as independent
[1:24:12.320 --> 1:24:20.560]  states and this just happened this afternoon and the german counselor uh chancellor schultz has
[1:24:20.560 --> 1:24:27.920]  already uh stated that this is a mint against the minx agreement and ukraine has also stated that if
[1:24:27.920 --> 1:24:34.960]  russia recognizes the republics as independent states that it's them totally pulling out of
[1:24:34.960 --> 1:24:42.880]  minx at the minx agreements and the nato and not its states it has the possibility to use this
[1:24:42.880 --> 1:24:51.360]  against russia as a provocation to intensify the conflict here so we're gonna have to see how the
[1:24:51.360 --> 1:24:59.360]  world powers react but this is the newest possibility for a political escalation here
[1:24:59.360 --> 1:25:05.760]  here wow i could ask a hundred questions i mean you've you've done so much amazing work i feel
[1:25:05.760 --> 1:25:11.520]  like i know you uh my producer said hey we've got this well-known american reporter on he's going
[1:25:11.520 --> 1:25:15.520]  to come on as soon as i saw your face then i clicked all the countless videos i've watched
[1:25:15.520 --> 1:25:19.600]  in eight years of the stuff you've caught on tape we should have you on sometime just to send us
[1:25:19.600 --> 1:25:25.760]  your best clips of the incredible stuff you've people getting blown up buildings on fire bombs
[1:25:25.760 --> 1:25:31.280]  artillery coming in dead civilians i mean the the combat footage and stuff you've gotten has
[1:25:31.280 --> 1:25:37.840]  just been insane for americans and you're a navy veteran as well uh and military people in the us
[1:25:37.840 --> 1:25:41.760]  who've not been over there and seen this how serious is this and how would you describe it
[1:25:45.600 --> 1:25:50.960]  for many people they don't even in many people in the west they don't even realize that this war
[1:25:50.960 --> 1:25:57.360]  has been going on in europe for almost eight years now and the amounts of people as you said over
[1:25:57.360 --> 1:26:03.920]  14 000 people have been killed i personally think that's probably a low number but uh i mean this
[1:26:03.920 --> 1:26:11.680]  has been year after year a war that has intensified and then it calmed and it just keeps going on this
[1:26:11.680 --> 1:26:20.640]  cycle for eight years now with no real end in sight because it's all controlled by the world of powers
[1:26:20.640 --> 1:26:27.840]  the people here in don yet and the rest of it done boss i asked him every time i go and film
[1:26:27.840 --> 1:26:32.240]  their homes after they've been destroyed by the ukrainian forces what they want and they just
[1:26:32.240 --> 1:26:40.080]  say they want peace they want peace and to be no longer part of ukraine and the the main thing most
[1:26:40.080 --> 1:26:47.920]  of them wants is to become part of russia absolutely again i have been accused of being a russian
[1:26:47.920 --> 1:26:51.360]  agent i've never been to russia i'd love to go i'd love to go to israel i'd love to go to egypt
[1:26:51.360 --> 1:26:56.880]  i'd love to go a lot of places i haven't been i'd love to go to japan but being demonized as a russian
[1:26:56.880 --> 1:27:02.400]  agent made me go study russia more and find out how russia really is being ganged up on
[1:27:02.400 --> 1:27:07.840]  it's the only country that isn't invited to the billderberg group uh and you can say you know
[1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:12.240]  russia's got its problems i'm not saying it didn't you don't have its corruption and things but
[1:27:12.240 --> 1:27:16.320]  literally the whole world is getting up on russia you just can't deny that why do you think that's
[1:27:16.320 --> 1:27:27.600]  the case or do you disagree with that statement yes the whole western world has it tends to go
[1:27:27.600 --> 1:27:36.880]  against russia in the east as it could be said that the east also is on the opposite side of
[1:27:37.520 --> 1:27:45.920]  the western world which everyone realizes is the case but as the clip you showed of the president
[1:27:45.920 --> 1:27:53.520]  of russia of let him put in say how would the united states react if they're they were putting
[1:27:53.520 --> 1:28:01.040]  missiles like in the cuban missile crisis how did the united states react when russia if russia
[1:28:01.040 --> 1:28:06.880]  would try to encroach on the united states and this is what russia is doing they just don't
[1:28:08.080 --> 1:28:13.280]  want data to keep pushing and pushing over and over again and let's let that sink in and we'll
[1:28:13.280 --> 1:28:19.120]  do one more segment and let you go wherever you want to go so you got a lot to say imagine
[1:28:19.760 --> 1:28:24.560]  ten billion dollars in weapons all these foreign mercenaries and troops attacking the russian
[1:28:24.560 --> 1:28:29.200]  border the russians do a drill on their border and the world acts like they're raping babies or
[1:28:29.200 --> 1:28:35.200]  something i mean this is so obvious that the west is the aggressor here we'll be right back stay there
[1:28:35.200 --> 1:28:43.040]  patrick landcaster is our guest patrick landcaster news today and we're gonna come back and and just

[1:30:00.080 --> 1:30:08.720]  engineers always intended to push their coveted biomedical tyranny lockdowns until the populations
[1:30:08.720 --> 1:30:15.280]  rebelled they would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting
[1:30:15.280 --> 1:30:21.040]  anybody that speaks out against their locks but because of so many scientists and engineers and
[1:30:21.040 --> 1:30:26.960]  researchers and others coming public and and whistleblowers now their whole project is falling
[1:30:26.960 --> 1:30:34.080]  apart because the people are aware that it is a world government corporate takeover and so it's
[1:30:34.080 --> 1:30:39.120]  pulling back the curtain now more than ever the problem is some globalist controlled areas are
[1:30:39.120 --> 1:30:45.200]  not going to give up on their takeover like canada where they've now declared a civil emergency in
[1:30:45.200 --> 1:30:50.720]  martial law in ontario and other areas of the world are following suit like australia so pray

[1:32:11.600 --> 1:32:16.800]  organic in the volcanic soil better than watermelon coffee and yeah we buy it from the little farmers
[1:32:16.800 --> 1:32:20.160]  that you know the media calls communists but really they're just a commune and whatever the
[1:32:20.160 --> 1:32:24.240]  point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican government
[1:32:24.240 --> 1:32:28.080]  take over so i actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and i've been buying it for what 14 years
[1:32:28.080 --> 1:32:32.000]  and the price has never gone up the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:36.000]  percent more for pound and i just think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna find anywhere

[1:33:14.320 --> 1:33:19.440]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[1:33:19.440 --> 1:33:27.360]  ladies and gentlemen i don't say this to brag because we're in very dark times around the
[1:33:27.360 --> 1:33:34.400]  world but i say to let you know that even during the breaks we are reaching tens of millions of
[1:33:34.400 --> 1:33:39.520]  people in ways that someday i'll write a book long after we win this war or lose this war
[1:33:40.320 --> 1:33:44.240]  one way or another if it's god's will you'll learn about some of the inside baseball the
[1:33:44.240 --> 1:33:48.960]  things we've done but i can just tell you this you cannot bet on another news organization
[1:33:48.960 --> 1:33:54.480]  to do more than info wars i wish other places were as effective as we are and tucker carlsson
[1:33:54.480 --> 1:33:59.360]  and joe rogan have basically gotten there and we're not judging them we want them to go way past us
[1:33:59.360 --> 1:34:05.280]  but even behind the scenes you just don't know the influence of what we're doing and what we're up to
[1:34:05.280 --> 1:34:11.600]  and that's credit to you for keeping this dog in the fight this is all of us together our combined
[1:34:11.600 --> 1:34:19.200]  will to carry this out patrick Lancaster is an amazing veteran independent crowd-funded journalist
[1:34:19.200 --> 1:34:24.400]  who's lived for eight years in eastern ukraine and covered the ongoing globalist proxy war
[1:34:24.400 --> 1:34:31.920]  it's also a u.s. navy veteran what what got you out there to that area to donask what what got you
[1:34:31.920 --> 1:34:36.160]  to you to ukraine and what other points would you like to make to this audience
[1:34:36.160 --> 1:34:47.920]  what really got me uh interested in pushing the facts that i see it with my own eyes here
[1:34:47.920 --> 1:34:57.200]  is when i came to Crimea during the referendum there when Crimea joined Russia because i saw
[1:34:57.200 --> 1:35:03.280]  what the western media was showing and how it was totally different than what i saw with my own eyes
[1:35:03.280 --> 1:35:12.160]  there how the people there just were just so happy just in tears of being able to join Russia again
[1:35:12.800 --> 1:35:19.280]  because i mean the people that were born before 1956 in Crimea were born in Russia and they were
[1:35:19.280 --> 1:35:26.480]  just so happy to go back to their their home and that wasn't what the western media mainstream
[1:35:26.480 --> 1:35:33.360]  media was showing so when everything started to come down in Crimea i saw the escalation that
[1:35:33.360 --> 1:35:41.360]  was happening in the bus and decided to come here and try to show the world what was really happening
[1:35:42.400 --> 1:35:47.840]  what i saw with my own eyes here i don't like to put my opinions at all in my reports i just show
[1:35:47.840 --> 1:35:54.160]  exactly what i see and what the facts are on the ground because the western mainstream media won't
[1:35:54.160 --> 1:36:01.920]  show what it goes against their country's narratives absolutely i don't know if you saw this a week
[1:36:01.920 --> 1:36:08.720]  and a half ago but uh the spokesperson for the state department from the CIA was there
[1:36:08.720 --> 1:36:14.000]  saying that Russia was going to stage a false flag and had a fake video of atrocities by the
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:18.080]  Ukrainians against the Russians even though there's ongoing war and people being killed
[1:36:18.080 --> 1:36:22.320]  they were saying no none of that exists it's all fake the Russians have made a fake video and the
[1:36:22.320 --> 1:36:29.040]  uh reporter for ap said well that's alex jones territory you're getting into now well then when
[1:36:29.040 --> 1:36:36.160]  i say there's false flags which do happen i have evidence like jessie spollett wmd's in iraq gulf
[1:36:36.160 --> 1:36:42.240]  of tonkin operation northwood those are all real things people can look up but what do you think
[1:36:42.240 --> 1:36:46.880]  the west was trying to do claiming russia is going to be involved in a false flag was nato
[1:36:46.880 --> 1:36:50.640]  planning to attack russians and when russians attacked say oh we didn't attack that's fake
[1:36:50.640 --> 1:36:53.200]  or did they think russia might actually stage a false flag
[1:36:57.040 --> 1:37:07.440]  they were pushing their agenda and as the ap reporter asked him where is the evidence of
[1:37:07.440 --> 1:37:13.600]  this so-called a false flag that's going to happen they they couldn't produce any evidence
[1:37:13.600 --> 1:37:19.840]  because there was no evidence this was just something that was generated to again discredits
[1:37:19.840 --> 1:37:30.400]  russia and try to further their agenda of this magical russian invasion where the big bad
[1:37:30.400 --> 1:37:35.600]  did the russian wolf was gonna hop and puff and blow your brain down and they just kept trying
[1:37:35.600 --> 1:37:42.160]  to push that and it's going to be interesting to see what their next line is to push this agenda
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:47.920]  what do you think the globalists to control our puppet president here in the u.s what do you
[1:37:47.920 --> 1:37:52.320]  think they're seeing and doing right now that russia has pulled back from the border and is
[1:37:52.320 --> 1:37:56.720]  really letting the west mass all these troops and weapons so this is really a stand-down i don't
[1:37:56.720 --> 1:38:00.720]  know if i was the russian president if i would pull troops off the border people are massing
[1:38:00.720 --> 1:38:05.120]  troops on my border i'd pull back i get why he's doing it's kind of an obi-wan kanobi move where
[1:38:05.120 --> 1:38:09.920]  he lets darth vader get him to show who the bad guy is or a martin Luther king style junior move
[1:38:09.920 --> 1:38:15.360]  here i just hope that the west doesn't get pissed now and launch an attack on russia as a provocation
[1:38:15.360 --> 1:38:23.760]  what do you think's really going to happen there are just so many possibilities and things are
[1:38:23.760 --> 1:38:31.680]  changing on an not even daily basis just an hourly basis so much also depends on like i said if
[1:38:32.480 --> 1:38:39.280]  putin recognizes the republic's independent countries and what the west decides to do with
[1:38:39.280 --> 1:38:46.320]  that information so it's i can't even comment on what can happen next because everything can
[1:38:46.320 --> 1:38:50.560]  change by the time we're done with this show what do you think of all the i'm sure you've
[1:38:50.560 --> 1:38:56.160]  seen it you're super informed all the videos of the state department for provocatively showing
[1:38:56.160 --> 1:39:01.680]  billions in any aircraft any tank missiles javelins you name it being shipped in and the
[1:39:01.680 --> 1:39:06.640]  celebrations and the calls for war by the minority of ukrainians they've obviously whipped into war
[1:39:06.640 --> 1:39:11.120]  fury and as you said you're living right in the town they've already been attacking what is it like
[1:39:11.120 --> 1:39:17.520]  to know they don't just have smaller mortars and artillery and old-fashioned uh you know rpgs now
[1:39:17.520 --> 1:39:26.160]  and machine guns now they've got class a european british and us weapons well the the local population
[1:39:26.160 --> 1:39:32.640]  here is afraid uh when those weapons are going to start hitting their homes because the people
[1:39:32.640 --> 1:39:39.840]  here see this because as you said that ukraine is bragging about this these weapons arriving
[1:39:39.840 --> 1:39:45.680]  and these aren't the first western weapons arising less than two weeks ago i did a report
[1:39:45.680 --> 1:39:53.920]  on a civilian uh electric substation which was targeted by ukraine forces not far from where
[1:39:53.920 --> 1:40:02.800]  i am right now and we found the evidence of 60 millimeter mortars being used launched from
[1:40:02.800 --> 1:40:10.800]  ukraine territory no question about it and these 60 millimeter mortars are not in the arsenal of
[1:40:10.800 --> 1:40:18.160]  ukraine nor were in the arsenal of the soviet union or russia these were western supplied
[1:40:18.160 --> 1:40:24.080]  60 millimeter mortars they did not come from the east they came from the west and it's not
[1:40:24.080 --> 1:40:28.480]  necessarily that they came in these new shipments they came from shipments before that weren't
[1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:38.080]  necessarily told about and publicized and the people here they see this and they're just afraid
[1:40:38.080 --> 1:40:42.400]  of what's going to happen next absolutely it's just insane there's no doubt who's pushing the
[1:40:42.400 --> 1:40:46.560]  borders of nato there's no doubt who's shipping in high-tech weapons there's no doubt who's trying
[1:40:46.560 --> 1:40:50.960]  to start a war with russia and she can turn us all patrick lancaster thank you so much look forward

[1:44:10.880 --> 1:44:17.440]  is there a real study of the planet's ruling class and that's done by design the large central banks
[1:44:17.440 --> 1:44:23.600]  that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics that look into say the
[1:44:23.600 --> 1:44:27.760]  anglo-american establishment the founder of the builder bird group the trilateral commission of
[1:44:27.760 --> 1:44:33.120]  the united nations the whole project of the roth shawls and the rocky folks until 10 years ago

[1:45:55.440 --> 1:46:00.480]  get yours at infowarstore.com today micah california thanks for calling i think we're barking up the
[1:46:00.480 --> 1:46:06.640]  wrong tree calling this gain of function research now if you read the actual you know 2014 legislation
[1:46:06.640 --> 1:46:12.800]  the u.s government gain of function deliberative process and research funding pause on selected
[1:46:12.800 --> 1:46:17.280]  gain of function research involving influenza mers and dars virus there's nothing about
[1:46:17.280 --> 1:46:23.040]  stars like viruses and it's a research funding pause it's not a stop it's not a prohibition it's
[1:46:23.040 --> 1:46:27.200]  when you come to a four-way intersection there's the stop sign you stop you look both ways and
[1:46:27.200 --> 1:46:32.720]  then you proceed and so it's also it doesn't pause all gain of function just selected gain of function
[1:46:32.720 --> 1:46:37.680]  but they'll argue that this is actually characterization and qualification research so you
[1:46:37.680 --> 1:46:41.440]  know rand and the others you know maybe Fauci was right they don't quite know what they're talking
[1:46:41.440 --> 1:46:45.120]  about calling it gain of function you know that's why he didn't perjure himself that's why he
[1:46:45.120 --> 1:46:49.280]  hasn't been arrested because they're literally creating new synthetic life forms that mimic
[1:46:49.280 --> 1:46:53.920]  what the viruses do but in the main definition it's still a gain of function you're making
[1:46:53.920 --> 1:46:57.360]  something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people thank you mic we love you
[1:46:57.360 --> 1:47:04.640]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:47:15.120 --> 1:47:20.400]  all right we've got giant news and inside intel it's massive that i'll get next hour and then
[1:47:20.400 --> 1:47:26.240]  take your calls into the fourth hour today on the Durham investigation and just how seismic that is
[1:47:26.240 --> 1:47:32.560]  but i wanted to get one of the top criminal and first amendment lawyers civil rights lawyers in
[1:47:32.560 --> 1:47:37.040]  the country all lawyers say to the top and he really is one of the top two or three guys in
[1:47:37.040 --> 1:47:45.760]  the country norm patis to join us about this big event that's happened 75 million dollar settlement
[1:47:46.320 --> 1:47:54.480]  with remington the bankrupted u.s. gun company the first gun company in america in the u.s. first
[1:47:54.480 --> 1:48:01.040]  supplied our first military they have after having the supreme court say that the whole trial can go
[1:48:01.040 --> 1:48:07.920]  ahead and all this litigation and fights can continue after a six-year battle or so that they've
[1:48:07.920 --> 1:48:14.960]  now settled for 75 million dollars now the same law firm hooked in with senator blumenthal and others
[1:48:14.960 --> 1:48:19.200]  the stolen glory guy that claimed he was in combat in vietnam and all the rest of it never left the
[1:48:19.200 --> 1:48:24.800]  u.s. had a cuss job at the dc capital literally collecting toys for children which is fine but
[1:48:24.800 --> 1:48:30.160]  he's a liar a fraud he runs all this basically from my research and his sons in the law firm and
[1:48:30.160 --> 1:48:33.840]  they're all involved there the democratic party hillary clinton who's now been caught in the
[1:48:33.840 --> 1:48:40.960]  Durham investigation with her crimes boy the ship is sinking for these guys they have they have
[1:48:40.960 --> 1:48:46.320]  you know come out declared victory 75 million dollars and this is a signal that no gun manufacturer
[1:48:46.320 --> 1:48:53.360]  is safe in america and the u.n. and the and the democratic party are involved in with the mexican
[1:48:53.360 --> 1:48:58.960]  government suing gun manufacturers saying guns from the u.s. to mexico is our fault when it was
[1:48:58.960 --> 1:49:04.880]  fast and furious where obama ordered hundreds of thousands of guns shipped into mexico on record
[1:49:04.880 --> 1:49:08.960]  but that'll never come out because the judges will never let that in court so this is a false
[1:49:08.960 --> 1:49:13.520]  flag against our second amendment but i wanted to get norm paddock's take on this because
[1:49:13.520 --> 1:49:20.160]  you know we we've had these democratic party law firms that represent these these of these parents
[1:49:21.440 --> 1:49:25.040]  come out against the first amendment in my case come out against the second amendment
[1:49:25.600 --> 1:49:31.040]  and now they've got their 75 million dollars do you expect them in all their lawsuits against me
[1:49:31.040 --> 1:49:35.440]  to go away and obviously the answer is not because there's never enough people that have to pay for
[1:49:35.440 --> 1:49:40.880]  the dead children i people could be in the street and say you killed those kids and i say really
[1:49:40.880 --> 1:49:45.120]  and they go yeah it's happening in front of my family at least three times in the last year
[1:49:45.120 --> 1:49:50.400]  because the public's so dumbed down no one knows adam adam lands his name so norm paddock's be with
[1:49:50.400 --> 1:49:54.480]  his 20 minutes the next hour i appreciate him holding but here's some of the background fbi
[1:49:54.480 --> 1:50:00.480]  resident warned police sandy hook shooter threatened to kill mom students newtown connecticut are they
[1:50:00.480 --> 1:50:07.760]  liable no newly released fbi documents reveal disturbing details about sandy hook shooter adam
[1:50:07.760 --> 1:50:16.720]  lanza no one knows his name because he's now alex jones new fbi release documents reveal disturbing
[1:50:16.720 --> 1:50:23.520]  details about sandy hook shooter alex jones because that's literally who i am now with brain
[1:50:23.520 --> 1:50:29.200]  dead leftist voters very very sad i didn't build my operation on them i hardly ever talked about it
[1:50:29.200 --> 1:50:34.240]  at the level they say but they have made me the sandy hook guy they've attached themselves to me
[1:50:34.240 --> 1:50:38.720]  the lawyers the democrats but they attach themselves the second amendment and are taking it down
[1:50:38.720 --> 1:50:43.920]  and now they want my free speech meanwhile judge throws out pale and liable case against the new
[1:50:43.920 --> 1:50:50.320]  york times to see the new york times gets things wrong on purpose they lie on purpose alex jones
[1:50:50.320 --> 1:50:56.320]  makes mistakes sometimes not often but when he does he's evil because he is a citizen blogger on
[1:50:56.320 --> 1:51:02.800]  the radio he has to be shut down so norm paddock's the paddock's law joins us right now to discuss
[1:51:02.800 --> 1:51:07.280]  this we haven't pre-war game this or talk before i just called him before i went live and said
[1:51:07.280 --> 1:51:12.640]  you want to come on uh in a couple hours he said sure and so here he is right now to give his take
[1:51:12.640 --> 1:51:17.760]  on all this norm great to have you on with us thanks alex no it's a shocking settlement as
[1:51:17.760 --> 1:51:22.240]  reported in the end you know details are hard to come by the casco firm gave a press conference
[1:51:22.240 --> 1:51:27.120]  this morning and that has been widely reported on as reported in the wall street journal um
[1:51:27.120 --> 1:51:32.720]  previously there was an offer to settle the case for i think 32 or 33 million that represented
[1:51:32.720 --> 1:51:37.920]  the policy limit for two of the four insurance companies um that were defending or responsible
[1:51:37.920 --> 1:51:43.280]  for defending remington now all four insurance companies have tendered or offered their policy
[1:51:43.280 --> 1:51:49.840]  limits um and that is 73 million dollars presumably that will settle the case for the nine families
[1:51:49.840 --> 1:51:57.680]  involved what i find particularly shocking about this um is that it viscerates eliminates erases
[1:51:57.680 --> 1:52:04.480]  traditional notions of proximate cause um usually in a case in tried involving personal injury
[1:52:04.480 --> 1:52:09.920]  you have to show that the acts or omissions of the person you're suing actually caused legally
[1:52:09.920 --> 1:52:15.200]  caused damage to another person in this case the plaintiffs are legislating by litigation
[1:52:15.840 --> 1:52:21.280]  they're deciding what the law should be and they're terrorizing or attempting to terrorize
[1:52:21.280 --> 1:52:26.000]  private industry into doing what they think is right now what's the legal background here
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:31.280]  um remington was sued under the connecticut unfair trade practice act which makes it possible
[1:52:31.280 --> 1:52:39.120]  um to pursue an a company if they engage in immoral or unscrupulous advertising because
[1:52:39.120 --> 1:52:45.040]  remington marketed these devices as tools for combat um and presumably targeted young men
[1:52:45.040 --> 1:52:49.920]  for those and adam lance had the gun never mind that his mother bought it um she wasn't the one
[1:52:49.920 --> 1:52:57.360]  who was tooled for done targeted for advertising um therefore um this represented an exception to
[1:52:57.360 --> 1:53:03.440]  the federal bar on suits against gun manufacturers it was an extremely close case in the connecticut
[1:53:03.440 --> 1:53:10.080]  supreme court decided for three um the u.s supreme court decided not to weigh in and the result was
[1:53:10.080 --> 1:53:16.000]  the case could advance for trial but here's what's highly unusual and makes you wonder kind of what's
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:22.960]  going on because the case involving remington and the sandy hook families was set to start trial in
[1:53:22.960 --> 1:53:28.080]  september there's another trial that is set to start in september and that's the case of the
[1:53:28.080 --> 1:53:33.600]  sandy hook families versus free speech systems and alex jones so how were those two trials going
[1:53:33.600 --> 1:53:39.440]  to take place simultaneously well they were let's be clear the same law firm the same democrat law
[1:53:39.440 --> 1:53:46.160]  firm the same firm um say i think some overlapping plaintiffs i'm not sure about that i haven't
[1:53:46.160 --> 1:53:52.000]  compared the plaintiffs in the case against you to the plaintiffs in remington but the same firm
[1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:57.680]  was going to be on trial allegedly at the same time against two folks or two groups of defendants
[1:53:57.680 --> 1:54:02.640]  demonized uh regarding that's right i mean everybody's got to pay these people i mean my god they
[1:54:02.640 --> 1:54:07.760]  would go back in a time machine to make jesus based your money i mean it's remington it's the police
[1:54:07.760 --> 1:54:13.520]  are sued the teachers are sued that they might sue the easter bunny next that well you know you
[1:54:13.520 --> 1:54:19.520]  you make a facet facetious point but it involves an important principle and that is the notion of
[1:54:19.520 --> 1:54:25.600]  proximate cause but for the fact that we all got out of bed this morning um we wouldn't be aware of
[1:54:25.600 --> 1:54:30.560]  all the suffering in the world is the fact that we woke up does that make us responsible for that
[1:54:30.560 --> 1:54:36.160]  suffering um so somebody pay us for what we viewed no that's what's called but for causation the world
[1:54:36.160 --> 1:54:41.360]  is a string of causation of events linked to one another when looked back at um from a certain
[1:54:41.360 --> 1:54:46.480]  perspective in time but proximate cause says there has to be some limitation on causation
[1:54:46.480 --> 1:54:52.720]  and usually the doctrines that reign in limitations on causation are an identifiable victim in imminent
[1:54:52.720 --> 1:54:58.080]  risk of harm where it was foreseeable that the person would be would be harmed now if remington
[1:54:58.080 --> 1:55:03.120]  had had the balls to try that case and put it on in front of a jury they could have said look
[1:55:03.120 --> 1:55:10.000]  maybe the advertising was respond um irresponsible but it's not proximately related to adam lanz's
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:14.480]  decision to go out and wipe out a classroom of first graders and the adults trying to protect
[1:55:14.480 --> 1:55:20.960]  them it was a horrible event no one is here to justify or excuse what mr lanz did but when the
[1:55:20.960 --> 1:55:26.960]  kaskoff firm can say look our purpose in bringing this litigation was to send a message to manufacturers
[1:55:26.960 --> 1:55:34.000]  to banks and insurers um you know don't stand behind these folks they're trying to do by legislative
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:38.880]  or by litigation fiat what the second amendment prohibits and what legislation yeah let's be
[1:55:38.880 --> 1:55:43.760]  clear they're filing lawsuits in deep blue areas and saying hey let's shut down the free speech
[1:55:43.760 --> 1:55:48.720]  of conservatives let's shut down the rights of all gun owners it's literally east coast controlled
[1:55:48.720 --> 1:55:55.280]  areas suing to take the midwesterners guns i mean this and they brag about this norm you know i'm
[1:55:55.280 --> 1:55:58.160]  just gonna say this stuff i didn't learn this from you but i'm just gonna bring it up right now
[1:55:58.880 --> 1:56:02.560]  they want me to come out against the second amendment hell will freeze over before i do it
[1:56:03.120 --> 1:56:08.880]  and they want 500 million dollars i don't have a million dollars in cash okay so so
[1:56:09.600 --> 1:56:14.320]  it's just insane they want us all fair and it ain't gonna happen they might be able to come
[1:56:14.320 --> 1:56:18.800]  in this building and shut this down but mr alex jones is going to be bigger than ever which i know
[1:56:18.800 --> 1:56:23.360]  they're mad about i don't know how much of that you know about norm but i learned about that from
[1:56:23.360 --> 1:56:29.360]  the folks at gcn they want 500 million dollars gcn doesn't have five million dollars and why don't
[1:56:29.360 --> 1:56:36.080]  they say 50 billion 100 billion because it's all about control and shutting down speech and they
[1:56:36.080 --> 1:56:43.360]  just put these big numbers up there uh to terrorize people norm it's about optics i think there is i
[1:56:43.360 --> 1:56:48.000]  think they will have bragging rights if they can obtain a large verdict against you which would
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:53.040]  result in shutting free speech systems down they'll say they silenced alex jones but as
[1:56:53.040 --> 1:56:58.640]  you pointed out they'll never silence alex jones you will reemerge in another context and you'll
[1:56:58.640 --> 1:57:03.920]  reemerge because the thing that they don't understand is that you speak to a sense of populist rage
[1:57:03.920 --> 1:57:09.920]  around the country which won't be slaked by elitist lawsuits shutting down people's rights to express
[1:57:09.920 --> 1:57:15.040]  themselves or defend themselves well let me just say this do you think we should have maybe 50 billion
[1:57:15.040 --> 1:57:19.360]  to the families and of course the law firm first maybe the democratic party now that they own gunshot
[1:57:19.360 --> 1:57:23.600]  victims they own all this maybe we should all just give all our wealth to them i mean because
[1:57:23.600 --> 1:57:27.600]  how much money is 73 million enough is all the other money enough is the hundreds of millions
[1:57:27.600 --> 1:57:32.400]  they raised off of all their charities enough i mean well i know we're all collectively guilty
[1:57:32.400 --> 1:57:38.160]  for their children dying i just want to know what is enough and the answer is nothing we want your
[1:57:38.160 --> 1:57:43.280]  speech we want your country we want yourself defense and george soros runs your da's he's
[1:57:43.280 --> 1:57:52.000]  going to take your police away the globalist social engineers always intended to push their
[1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:59.520]  covid biomedical tyranny lockdowns until the populations rebelled they would then use that
[1:57:59.520 --> 1:58:05.760]  as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out
[1:58:05.760 --> 1:58:10.640]  against their lives but because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others
[1:58:10.640 --> 1:58:16.960]  coming public and and whistleblowers now their whole project is falling apart because the people
[1:58:16.960 --> 1:58:24.080]  are aware that it is a world government corporate takeover and so it's pulling back the curtain
[1:58:24.080 --> 1:58:28.960]  now more than ever the problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on
[1:58:28.960 --> 1:58:35.280]  their takeover like canada but they've now declared a civil emergency and martial law in ontario
[1:58:35.280 --> 1:58:40.720]  and other areas of the world are following suit like australia so pray for these folks big time
[1:58:40.720 --> 1:58:46.000]  it's a very serious situation and stay tuned into info wars dot com because truth is absolutely
[1:58:46.000 --> 1:59:01.920]  paramount from the words of chuck polinik's fight club dear globalist leaders of the great reset
[1:59:01.920 --> 1:59:06.880]  the people you're trying to step on we're everyone you depend on we're the people who do your
[1:59:06.880 --> 1:59:12.880]  laundry and cook your food and serve your dinner we make your bed we guard you while you're asleep
[1:59:12.880 --> 1:59:18.720]  we drive the ambulances we direct your call we are cooks and we are taxi drivers and we know
[1:59:18.720 --> 1:59:24.800]  everything about you we process your insurance claims and credit card charges we control every
[1:59:24.800 --> 1:59:30.080]  part of your life we are the middle children of history raised by television to believe
[1:59:30.080 --> 1:59:36.640]  that someday we'll be millionaires and movie stars but we won't and we're just learning this fact
[1:59:36.640 --> 1:59:59.440]  so don't with us support independent media at infowarstore.com if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[2:00:06.640 --> 2:00:17.440]  so
[2:00:29.760 --> 2:00:31.760]  well nor paddock is on fire during the break
[2:00:31.760 --> 2:00:38.480]  so i want him to repeat what he just said to me you're in the brayer about what this
[2:00:39.680 --> 2:00:45.280]  vicious blow defense means and now the same organization setting its sights of their own
[2:00:45.280 --> 2:00:51.520]  words on the first amendment norm paddock's no these you know these eye-popping numbers
[2:00:51.520 --> 2:00:57.600]  aren't about money they're about control and if you can be starved into submission the goal is
[2:00:57.600 --> 2:01:03.120]  submission and so this company was put out of business they're aiming to put you out of business
[2:01:03.120 --> 2:01:07.440]  and to put free speech systems out of business and they're aiming maybe even they harbor the
[2:01:07.440 --> 2:01:12.720]  fantasy of taking over the studio and transforming it into the broadcast that they want but the point
[2:01:12.720 --> 2:01:17.280]  is they're failing to realize that you're responding to a need in the public at large
[2:01:17.280 --> 2:01:23.200]  that they can't satisfy um so the info war will continue it will just move to another forum
[2:01:23.200 --> 2:01:28.000]  if they are successful now i'm you know you've had you just let the cat out of the bag i mean
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:31.920]  they they approached ccn and said let us just take the show over and put our own stuff on or
[2:01:31.920 --> 2:01:37.440]  take him off the air i mean that's how crazy this is the left is so entitled with all their
[2:01:37.440 --> 2:01:41.760]  elitist power and money they but they believe they don't just get the shut us up they get to move
[2:01:41.760 --> 2:01:49.200]  in to who we were doesn't work like that the single most um significant threat to civil liberties
[2:01:49.200 --> 2:01:54.400]  at my view at least in our lifetime in the next 10 years is going to be a struggle over what i call
[2:01:54.400 --> 2:02:00.400]  the politics of virtue um and there is a struggle for the levers levers levers of control um by
[2:02:00.400 --> 2:02:05.440]  those who think we know how best to live both in terms of public health global security climate
[2:02:05.440 --> 2:02:10.960]  change with respect to guns with respect to speech with respect to speech code with respect to what
[2:02:10.960 --> 2:02:17.600]  we can do they're aided and assisted by large algorithms that can be um um programmed to respond
[2:02:17.600 --> 2:02:22.720]  to that vision of the good and we're going to see increasing efforts at social control which
[2:02:22.720 --> 2:02:27.360]  will reach down to the ordinary person in their pocketbook your credit card will become a means
[2:02:27.360 --> 2:02:32.720]  of depriving you of access of access to things when the code isn't accepted because your social
[2:02:32.720 --> 2:02:38.320]  utility score isn't isn't right that's from the bottom up from the top down large institutions
[2:02:38.320 --> 2:02:43.920]  will be crippled or bankrupt or taken over with large judgments if they can be obtained so you
[2:02:43.920 --> 2:02:48.320]  know i don't know what the guys in the executive suite at remington were thinking but this is a
[2:02:48.320 --> 2:02:53.200]  case that should have been fought um and a jury of ordinary people might have reached a different
[2:02:53.200 --> 2:02:58.400]  decision as we are hoping they will do in the case against you elix i don't have any doubt that
[2:02:58.400 --> 2:03:03.520]  remington's lawyers will come out swinging and ask for tens if not hundreds of millions in a jury
[2:03:03.520 --> 2:03:08.960]  trial and we will ask a jury to follow the law and to use their common sense to conclude that if
[2:03:08.960 --> 2:03:14.160]  they came for you first they're coming for these jurors next and in the end there's no satisfying
[2:03:14.160 --> 2:03:18.160]  a republican version but i mean norm less we listen i've been in four years of litigation you've
[2:03:18.160 --> 2:03:23.040]  been out here three plus years you've been in all our books everything i don't have a half million
[2:03:23.040 --> 2:03:29.440]  dollars in my personal bank account which i enjoy it's so hilarious that i can pop up anywhere and
[2:03:29.440 --> 2:03:34.000]  reach all the same systems be bigger than ever and they think they're gonna get money and they're not
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:38.720]  because we know though they now know that they don't want money like we said they want to silence
[2:03:38.720 --> 2:03:43.520]  us that was a cherry on top after they shut down our oldest gun manufacturer remington
[2:03:43.520 --> 2:03:49.760]  to get that money from their insurance carriers it was it when and it was a sign of what's to come
[2:03:49.760 --> 2:03:55.040]  i mean i i mean i i'm just shocked by this i think it's bad for the civil justice system
[2:03:55.040 --> 2:04:00.240]  i think it's going to encourage um legislation by litigation ambitious plaintiffs lawyers everywhere
[2:04:00.240 --> 2:04:04.960]  going to try to um use the bankruptcy code to enforce their visions of the good and we will
[2:04:04.960 --> 2:04:11.760]  enter into a form of economic warfare disguised as litigation uh where the rights of the non well
[2:04:11.760 --> 2:04:17.920]  healed those without financial backing are going to be held in in jeopardy by those who have financial
[2:04:17.920 --> 2:04:24.320]  banking and can turn the courts into a tool of extortion uh the remington settlement uh for all
[2:04:24.320 --> 2:04:29.840]  the topping character um is a nightmare for the civil justice system it eviscerates traditional
[2:04:29.840 --> 2:04:35.520]  notions of legal causation not totally agree but here's the good news historically bullying with
[2:04:35.520 --> 2:04:43.360]  americans and let's just say historically anglo-saxon ideas and thought does not go too well some
[2:04:43.360 --> 2:04:47.920]  places intimidation works it's gonna blow up and their face is going to cause massive resistance
[2:04:47.920 --> 2:04:51.840]  so they fit off more than they can chew norm let's come back and talk about the sarah palin case in

[2:06:16.480 --> 2:06:24.000]  oh and let me add judge andrew depolitano is about to be joining us he was censored
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:30.560]  he was suspended it began the end of his career at fox when he five years ago four and a half years
[2:06:30.560 --> 2:06:38.880]  ago in 2017 said hey they were spying on trump illegally and specifically gave details from his
[2:06:38.880 --> 2:06:43.840]  sources now it's all vindicated with the derma investigation that's coming up in a few minutes
[2:06:43.840 --> 2:06:49.600]  but getting back to these other legal issues norm paddus constitutional lawyer what do you make of
[2:06:49.600 --> 2:06:55.520]  the sarah palin situation i like sarah palin i think it's wrong that the new york times falsely
[2:06:55.520 --> 2:07:00.160]  said that she put crosshairs over the head of a congresswoman and others that later got shot six
[2:07:00.160 --> 2:07:06.880]  killed but i believe in the first amendment and we can't prove they lied on purpose i really think
[2:07:06.880 --> 2:07:11.760]  the new york times versus settlement or settle the new york times should should stand but it seems
[2:07:11.760 --> 2:07:15.840]  we're creating a system where the new york times gets its speech but alex jones doesn't get its
[2:07:15.840 --> 2:07:20.960]  speech there's the alex jones exceptions i like sarah palin but at the same time she was a vice
[2:07:20.960 --> 2:07:28.560]  presidential candidate she's been a big politician she's in a big uh you know man woman's world and
[2:07:28.560 --> 2:07:32.800]  in my experience you get in the arena you better expect stuff i mean if i sued people every time
[2:07:32.800 --> 2:07:37.680]  they lied about me or said you know really bad things i'd be in in the court all day that's my
[2:07:37.680 --> 2:07:41.680]  view people say why haven't i sued a bunch of people well that's not who i am i sued the january
[2:07:41.680 --> 2:07:45.920]  six committee with you because that's my private stuff they don't deserve it and it's a lie uh
[2:07:45.920 --> 2:07:50.800]  but but just in in closing what do you make of the uh judge while the jury deliberating
[2:07:50.800 --> 2:07:54.880]  throwing out saying they didn't have malice of forethought with intention to do harm i mean
[2:07:54.880 --> 2:08:01.200]  how do we know that well so the judge you know all judges have a responsibility to prevent cases
[2:08:01.840 --> 2:08:07.120]  from getting to a jury unless there's sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find in favor
[2:08:07.120 --> 2:08:12.480]  of the plaintiff or the government if it's criminal case this judge concluded um that miss palin had
[2:08:12.480 --> 2:08:18.560]  not produced a trial sufficient evidence of malice to permit the case to go to judgment however the
[2:08:18.560 --> 2:08:23.760]  judge did something very very significant he basically took a reservation on that decision
[2:08:23.760 --> 2:08:29.200]  and he's letting the jury continue to deliberate um so that if the jury disagrees and says it did
[2:08:29.200 --> 2:08:34.800]  then uh and the case goes up for appeal um they won't have to retry the case so it's an unconventional
[2:08:34.800 --> 2:08:40.960]  move um the judge is a guy named ned rakeoff he's a very bright person i've seen these sort of
[2:08:40.960 --> 2:08:46.880]  reservations taken before but the larger issue is is whether miss palin whether the new york
[2:08:46.880 --> 2:08:52.080]  times v selivan will survive and whether as to public figures there'll be a finding of actual
[2:08:52.080 --> 2:08:59.840]  malice as necessary um um for a case to get to to a jury on on defamation now you know palin
[2:08:59.840 --> 2:09:05.840]  um i guess got lucky that the plaintiffs didn't you know move for a default against her we wanted
[2:09:05.840 --> 2:09:12.320]  to raise the same case defense in your case um and you know the as the case evolved um the
[2:09:12.320 --> 2:09:17.040]  cost call plaintiffs were able to create an image of what your company should look and persuade a
[2:09:17.040 --> 2:09:21.760]  judge because it didn't look that way um you weren't complying with discovery and she entered a
[2:09:21.760 --> 2:09:27.760]  disciplinary default we disagree with that ruling um and if necessary we'll take an appeal at the
[2:09:27.760 --> 2:09:33.440]  appropriate moment um but you know there the first amendment is on the line everywhere
[2:09:33.440 --> 2:09:37.920]  and you know publicly to protect debate the new york times versus selivan has said of
[2:09:37.920 --> 2:09:44.480]  public figures um that you have to prove more than that a speaker got something wrong you have to
[2:09:44.480 --> 2:09:53.360]  prove actual malice some people say that that standard is too high um to um have the same
[2:09:53.360 --> 2:09:58.320]  standard your sky's breaking up a bit i mean i'm a layperson but all i know is this the new york
[2:09:58.320 --> 2:10:02.720]  times gets one treatment which i think the first amendment sacrosanct they should get that unless
[2:10:02.720 --> 2:10:07.920]  there's a smoking gun that they lied on purpose you know they shouldn't be in trouble and then over
[2:10:07.920 --> 2:10:12.720]  here though the other side defaults us we give them all our stuff they lie and say we didn't give it
[2:10:12.720 --> 2:10:18.560]  to them and then now i'm just guilty the judge says uh and and and then i've got to be shut down
[2:10:18.560 --> 2:10:22.400]  that is extremely dangerous and that goes with everything else we're seeing where justice is
[2:10:22.400 --> 2:10:28.560]  one way for the left and one way for the right well i think there's a there's a growing tendency to
[2:10:28.560 --> 2:10:33.840]  want to protect mainstream media and say of citizen bloggers that we're not journalists
[2:10:33.840 --> 2:10:38.960]  that we don't have first amendment protection the case law says we do not everyone has to
[2:10:38.960 --> 2:10:43.600]  have the editorial board of the new york times in their back pocket to vet their utterances
[2:10:43.600 --> 2:10:49.120]  so i think there is a double standard emerging in the law the mainstream media you know the mama
[2:10:49.120 --> 2:10:55.120]  you know the new york times cnn the large networks they're going to be held to one standard which is
[2:10:55.120 --> 2:10:59.600]  permissive because they're going to be assumed to be doing the responsible thing vetting fact
[2:10:59.600 --> 2:11:05.680]  checking those of us who don't have those resources are going to be penalized for speaking our minds
[2:11:06.400 --> 2:11:11.520]  and the elimination of actual malice as a standard is going to have an inhibiting
[2:11:12.400 --> 2:11:16.880]  effect on speech speech of ordinary people people like you people like me well that's right if you're
[2:11:16.880 --> 2:11:21.120]  not a big powerful corporation you don't get speech because you're not you know have a huge
[2:11:21.120 --> 2:11:25.360]  fact checking group behind you that's obviously a bunch of corporate liars thank you so much
[2:11:25.360 --> 2:11:29.120]  norm patis for talking to us look forward to speaking to you again soon thanks for having me
[2:11:29.120 --> 2:11:34.080]  alex be well all right we've got him for the rest of the hour and i'm really really excited
[2:11:34.080 --> 2:11:40.560]  former judge former top fox news host completely vindicated on spying on trump got suspended at
[2:11:40.560 --> 2:11:45.520]  fox for saying this four plus years ago and then that was the slow decline they kind of locked
[2:11:45.520 --> 2:11:49.360]  him up and we didn't hear much from him then i predicted when it happened they would wait till
[2:11:49.360 --> 2:11:53.840]  people forgot about him by shutting him down and then get rid of him totally vindicated a real hero
[2:11:53.840 --> 2:11:57.920]  the Durham investigation will be able to lay it all out on the other side or here in just a moment
[2:11:57.920 --> 2:12:04.400]  but i wanted to play a short compilation of him back in the time 2017 doing what no other mainstream
[2:12:04.400 --> 2:12:10.640]  media person would do tell the truth here it is former judge and frequent fox news contributor
[2:12:10.640 --> 2:12:16.800]  andrew napolitano has reportedly been taken off the air for now multiple outlets say napolitano
[2:12:16.800 --> 2:12:22.480]  has been sidelined at fox for repeating on-air unverified claims that former president obama
[2:12:22.480 --> 2:12:29.120]  asked uk intelligence to spy on trump tower the barack obama spy on donald trump when president
[2:12:29.120 --> 2:12:35.120]  obama was in the white house and president trump was mr trump running for office well we don't really
[2:12:35.120 --> 2:12:40.880]  know the answer to that sources have told fox news the president obama could very easily have and
[2:12:40.880 --> 2:12:48.720]  probably did use a foreign intelligence service to gather this information for him three intelligence
[2:12:48.720 --> 2:12:56.400]  sources have informed fox news that president obama went outside the chain of command he used gchq
[2:12:56.400 --> 2:13:04.080]  what the heck is gchq that's the initials for the british spying agency both white house press
[2:13:04.080 --> 2:13:10.480]  secretary shan spicer and president trump defended accusations against obama by pointing to napolitano
[2:13:10.480 --> 2:13:16.800]  fox news is shepherd smith walked back napolitano's claims shortly thereafter fox news cannot confirm
[2:13:16.800 --> 2:13:23.120]  judge napolitano's commentary fox news knows of no evidence of any kind that the now president
[2:13:23.120 --> 2:13:32.320]  of the united states was surveilled at any time in any way full stop all right so four plus years
[2:13:32.320 --> 2:13:36.960]  later judge napolitano totally vindicated we're about two minutes from break but sir i know you're
[2:13:36.960 --> 2:13:41.840]  not about vindicating yourself but we could see you getting penalized shut down and then removed
[2:13:41.840 --> 2:13:47.200]  from air for telling the truth and going after obama hillary the whole deep state now you i mean
[2:13:47.200 --> 2:13:51.760]  you're like going to be the image of the dictionary next to the word vindication now thanks for
[2:13:51.760 --> 2:13:56.880]  joining us on short notice judge uh you're very kind uh to say that out and thank you for running
[2:13:56.880 --> 2:14:03.920]  those old clips when my hair was a little darker uh look i mean i woke up yesterday morning like
[2:14:03.920 --> 2:14:10.000]  everybody else did i hadn't paid attention to what uh durham had filed over the weekend uh
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:17.040]  but we now know that a significant arm of the federal government armed with fbi agents uh
[2:14:17.040 --> 2:14:25.840]  and cia agents used federal assets to spy on mr donald trump during his presidential campaign
[2:14:25.840 --> 2:14:31.200]  and on president donald trump after he was already the president of the united states
[2:14:31.760 --> 2:14:37.040]  we now know that and the federal government of the united states acknowledges it and if it has to
[2:14:37.040 --> 2:14:43.840]  was prepared to prove it in court in the case against michael susman is that the craziest thing
[2:14:43.840 --> 2:14:49.520]  in your career i mean in my life i've never seen anything like this this is crazy well it it it was
[2:14:49.520 --> 2:14:56.960]  crazy because nobody would accept it nobody wanted to accept it people came to me and begged to me
[2:14:56.960 --> 2:15:06.000]  you owe president obama an apology for for what you know about three months later five gchq
[2:15:06.800 --> 2:15:14.960]  that's a british intelligence agents went to the guardian of london a left-wing publication and said
[2:15:14.960 --> 2:15:21.200]  uh that judge in new york is correct we didn't personally do it but we know who did so there
[2:15:21.200 --> 2:15:26.080]  was somewhat of a vindication then the united states government the obama administration
[2:15:26.080 --> 2:15:34.000]  still didn't accept it but uh the filing from john uh durham on friday afternoon is so definitive
[2:15:34.800 --> 2:15:40.560]  there's no way he could have made that filing unless he has the absolute proof uh to substantiated
[2:15:40.560 --> 2:15:44.800]  and of course it gets deeper and i was about to say it gets deeper sir please stay there we're right back
[2:15:44.800 --> 2:15:47.920]  you're gonna have the floor we're so honored to have you because this is so big of the future

[2:20:02.800 --> 2:20:24.320]  well i gotta tell you ladies and gentlemen i am starstruck right now because i've always loved
[2:20:24.320 --> 2:20:28.720]  judge nap watching decades on tv and got to interview him before and you know hang out with
[2:20:28.720 --> 2:20:34.160]  him some in new york but now that he's vindicated and been punished and basically taken off the air
[2:20:35.200 --> 2:20:41.520]  for telling the truth he was suspended and then phased out for exposing illegal deep state spying
[2:20:41.520 --> 2:20:46.560]  and now we know it wasn't just the british it wasn't just these private corporations but then
[2:20:46.560 --> 2:20:50.480]  the government was involved and the wheels are coming off this and we're just blessed to have
[2:20:50.480 --> 2:20:55.920]  him here to lay this all out be sure and bookmark his site and find his a weekday show judge nap
[2:20:55.920 --> 2:21:01.840]  dot com judge nap dot com uh judge i wonder how not going to criticize fox news or others but
[2:21:01.840 --> 2:21:06.240]  are they going to have you on for a victory lap now that you're so incredibly vindicated
[2:21:07.120 --> 2:21:12.160]  i mean that's probably a tongue-in-cheek question but you were saying this is a huge deal it certainly
[2:21:12.160 --> 2:21:17.440]  is explained to us why this is so definitive and what this Durham investigation means and now
[2:21:18.160 --> 2:21:22.720]  the former head of national intelligence and all these folks say dozens of more indictments are
[2:21:22.720 --> 2:21:29.760]  coming out because they quote gave Durham the documents what does all this mean well the the
[2:21:29.760 --> 2:21:33.680]  i don't know about the indictments because some of these crimes have a five-year statute of
[2:21:33.680 --> 2:21:40.160]  limitations and much of this happened in 2016 so do the math uh we're beyond the five years which
[2:21:40.160 --> 2:21:47.840]  means Hillary herself may skate however uh if this was uh a conspiracy and apparently it was
[2:21:47.840 --> 2:21:54.400]  and if john durham can report it the five years is measured when the crime is completed not when
[2:21:54.400 --> 2:22:01.120]  the crime started so it would depend how far into the trump administration the conspiracy extended
[2:22:01.120 --> 2:22:06.800]  if the conspiracy ended on election day it's too late to do anything about it but it appears from
[2:22:06.800 --> 2:22:12.720]  the documents uh that john durham filed on friday afternoon that the conspiracy did not end on
[2:22:12.720 --> 2:22:22.960]  election day it appears that there was a conversation in the oval office after um uh trump was elected
[2:22:22.960 --> 2:22:30.480]  in which president obama himself uh participated uh and discussions were had about using federal
[2:22:30.480 --> 2:22:35.680]  assets to spy on him and there are two very interesting people present there besides the
[2:22:35.680 --> 2:22:43.920]  president obama one is jake selvin who was mrs clinton's chief uh intelligence advisor on on spying
[2:22:43.920 --> 2:22:50.480]  and intelligence matters he's now president joe biden's uh national security director he has the
[2:22:50.480 --> 2:22:56.880]  highest national security clearance in the country it's the same as the president's the other interesting
[2:22:56.880 --> 2:23:03.760]  person there was vice president joe biden uh now this of course was four years ago was he part
[2:23:03.760 --> 2:23:13.440]  Alex was he part of the conspiracy to undermine donald trump's presidency by using federal assets
[2:23:13.440 --> 2:23:18.880]  you know you can compare this to watergate watergate was the use of private assets paid
[2:23:18.880 --> 2:23:24.960]  for by the republican national committee to break into an office and seize proof of who
[2:23:24.960 --> 2:23:32.240]  was having sex with whom and who was paying who off this is the use of federal assets uh jim
[2:23:32.240 --> 2:23:38.320]  comey all the way on the left there john brennan had the fbi at the time john brennan all the way
[2:23:38.320 --> 2:23:46.960]  on the right there head of the cia of the time so this this is is according to according to durham
[2:23:48.160 --> 2:23:55.280]  the use of federal assets to undermine a presidency now that is a half dozen different crimes there
[2:23:55.280 --> 2:24:00.080]  it would just depend upon when these crimes were committed or when this conspiracy ended
[2:24:00.080 --> 2:24:06.000]  or how much fortitude durham has and who he goes after so there's been a lot of criticism of durham
[2:24:06.000 --> 2:24:11.040]  taking years and years but to me i'm not a famous judge like you or a legal scholar but this looks
[2:24:11.040 --> 2:24:16.480]  like a super big ballsy move uh to do this with maryck garland as the attorney general and all
[2:24:16.480 --> 2:24:21.280]  this i mean this is like the the hydrogen bomb effect because we knew it was going on i should
[2:24:21.280 --> 2:24:26.400]  ask you how you knew from your sources but we had our sources we we were talking about it too but
[2:24:26.400 --> 2:24:31.600]  this is just such a big deal this has got a really concern as you said not just hillary
[2:24:31.600 --> 2:24:37.840]  but clearly this goes above that well you know it does and i know you want to talk about this
[2:24:37.840 --> 2:24:45.520]  eventually why why isn't the media covering this why why is the info wars a newsmax and fox news
[2:24:45.520 --> 2:24:50.000]  and the wall street journal exactly i still said that first no one's covering the i mean
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:55.120]  this makes watergate look like a child's play i mean this this is huge it does yes it does this
[2:24:55.120 --> 2:25:01.600]  should be never mind my allegations against the obama administration this is proof from a federal
[2:25:01.600 --> 2:25:07.440]  prosecutor this should be on the front page top of the fold of of the same washington post that
[2:25:07.440 --> 2:25:14.560]  brought richard nixon down uh and the same new york times that claims it's the standard american
[2:25:14.560 --> 2:25:21.920]  journalism uh but you haven't heard a peep about them you haven't heard on cnn or ns ms mbc or cmbc
[2:25:21.920 --> 2:25:30.320]  or any of the any of the networks uh they think and hope that by ignoring this it will go away now
[2:25:30.320 --> 2:25:39.200]  it could go away if michael susman pleads guilty that's the lawyer accused of lying to the fbi
[2:25:39.200 --> 2:25:44.800]  who was a lawyer for hillary clinton's campaign because he pleaded not guilty and there will be
[2:25:44.800 --> 2:25:49.040]  a trial this stuff will come out of the trial now i got to say a word about the crime that
[2:25:49.040 --> 2:25:55.840]  susman's charged with i don't believe it should be a crime to lie to the fbi why because the supreme
[2:25:55.840 --> 2:26:01.600]  court has said the fbi can lie to you well if the fbi can lie to you you should be able to lie to
[2:26:01.600 --> 2:26:07.280]  them they're not morally superior to you but but i am wrong the law is what it is if you lie to the
[2:26:07.280 --> 2:26:14.480]  fbi in an official inquiry uh you can be indicted and prosecuted that's what happened to susman and
[2:26:14.480 --> 2:26:17.840]  judge let me interrupt because i'm always interested about this that's why i won't talk to the fbi i
[2:26:17.840 --> 2:26:22.160]  won't talk to jan six to me it's not that i'm gonna lie it's that they're gonna say i'm a liar and
[2:26:22.160 --> 2:26:26.880]  indict me so it's not just that you can't lie to them they then say you're lying and play little
[2:26:26.880 --> 2:26:33.360]  split hairs games when did that become the law that you can't lie to the fbi oh i don't know but
[2:26:33.360 --> 2:26:39.120]  it's been the law for a long time and and the fbi will use it uh to the hilt here's a you know in
[2:26:39.120 --> 2:26:46.400]  the martha steward case in the same conversation in which she lied to them they lied to her the fbi
[2:26:46.400 --> 2:26:51.600]  agent who lied to her got a promotion she went to jail she was convicted of lying this is considered
[2:26:51.600 --> 2:26:57.360]  a low level crime the the maximum penalty is just a year in jail to a lawyer it's devastating because
[2:26:57.360 --> 2:27:04.320]  you'll lose uh your license to practice but but the the committee that you talk about sought you
[2:27:04.960 --> 2:27:11.920]  in the susman case he sought the fbi he knocked on the door and said i have to come to you i have
[2:27:11.920 --> 2:27:18.480]  devastating information about this guy donald trump and his connections to russia question
[2:27:18.480 --> 2:27:24.240]  are you representing the hillary clinton campaign oh no no no no i have this from independent sources
[2:27:24.240 --> 2:27:31.520]  that's the alleged lie he instigated the conversation himself during which it is alleged
[2:27:31.520 --> 2:27:37.280]  that he lied and he had the conversation with his now former friend peter baker who was the general
[2:27:37.280 --> 2:27:42.800]  counsel of the fbi normally you don't get to talk to the general counsel about this evidence
[2:27:42.800 --> 2:27:48.480]  but when you're a high-ranking big shot washington dc lawyer and the general counsel is your friend
[2:27:48.480 --> 2:27:54.160]  and you want to feed him some nonsense that's the guy you go to wow we're gonna go to break and come
[2:27:54.160 --> 2:27:58.400]  back this is just riveting janitor napolitano i don't want to make this about yourself but
[2:27:58.400 --> 2:28:05.440]  just in 50 seconds here i mean how did you know all this stuff i guess sources because you've been
[2:28:05.440 --> 2:28:12.080]  proven right well yes i had sources and one of my sources outed himself in the new york times
[2:28:12.800 --> 2:28:18.720]  went for his jugular but but something of this magnitude you have to verify it to three levels
[2:28:18.720 --> 2:28:27.200]  so in addition to the source who outed himself i had two other sources who were able to verify
[2:28:27.200 --> 2:28:33.520]  what i said before i said it well judge janitor napolitano is with us you got a bookmark his site
[2:28:33.520 --> 2:28:39.440]  and watch his show i watch it all the time judge nap dot com and man i just thought of him instantly
[2:28:39.440 --> 2:28:45.280]  this weekend when this all broke i was like oh my gosh because i mean it meant he was the one of the
[2:28:45.280 --> 2:28:50.320]  top guys at fox as soon as he covered this group they phased his ass out and that's what people pay
[2:28:50.320 --> 2:28:57.920]  for to tell the truth we'll be right back he's a hero anything of real quality anything of lasting
[2:28:57.920 --> 2:29:03.680]  durability anything that's really satisfying and empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to
[2:29:03.680 --> 2:29:11.520]  attain and when it comes to information boy is that true today we see the entire global corrupt
[2:29:11.520 --> 2:29:18.000]  into a human depopulation great reset combine trying to collapse our society to build on
[2:29:18.000 --> 2:29:24.800]  its ashes their their transhumanist nightmare vision suppressing the voices of good people
[2:29:24.800 --> 2:29:30.960]  all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives
[2:29:30.960 --> 2:29:37.120]  their covetous stereo their world's gonna end in 2030 carbon tax global warming bull all of it
[2:29:37.680 --> 2:29:43.120]  and none of it can succeed none of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is
[2:29:43.120 --> 2:29:48.880]  silenced and gaslit that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence
[2:29:48.880 --> 2:29:53.520]  and that's why it's hard to share in full wars links and band up video links that's why we've got
[2:29:53.520 --> 2:30:00.240]  to share them now more than ever whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally
[2:30:00.240 --> 2:30:06.320]  responsible for the assault on our democracy insurrection we will follow the facts wherever
[2:30:06.320 --> 2:30:13.120]  they lead domestic terrorists the days of independent media are numbered the government
[2:30:13.120 --> 2:30:18.960]  has made it illegal to oppose them they are now deep banking us behind the scenes they want to
[2:30:18.960 --> 2:30:25.200]  bankrupt us and make us go away quietly with practically half the population wanting to lock
[2:30:25.200 --> 2:30:31.200]  the unvaccinated up in camps the traders know they can shut us down by force but that would
[2:30:31.200 --> 2:30:38.800]  accelerate the awakening exponentially so be it make them silence us by force this is the final

[2:33:21.680 --> 2:33:33.360]  something you call love but confess well completely vindicated the capital v judge andrew depolitano
[2:33:33.360 --> 2:33:41.360]  joins us the minute 2017 he covered illegal spying against the trump campaign and president trump
[2:33:42.080 --> 2:33:47.840]  from his sources they suspended him and then basically pulled him off tv until he was finally
[2:33:47.840 --> 2:33:53.200]  let go and that was the reason for that we could all see it and he's a tough guy he's not whining
[2:33:53.200 --> 2:33:59.040]  about it he wants to just talk about the current news and how big this is but wow clinton campaign
[2:33:59.040 --> 2:34:05.200]  paid to infiltrate judge uh depolitano broke all this again trump campaign paid to infiltrate trump
[2:34:05.200 --> 2:34:12.960]  tower white house servers to link trump to russia durham finds and he's got the evidence and he's
[2:34:12.960 --> 2:34:19.280]  indicted the clinton lawyer and we know all this went on and as you said they out of themselves
[2:34:19.280 --> 2:34:26.720]  they had a new york times article on january 20 2017 where they bragged that they had wired
[2:34:26.720 --> 2:34:30.320]  tap trump and claimed that was the evidence he was a russian but there was no evidence so that
[2:34:30.320 --> 2:34:36.160]  was the first outing then depolitano dug into it and found out more so i could ask a thousand
[2:34:36.160 --> 2:34:40.800]  questions judge but in the 25 minutes we've got left i'd like to just give you the floor uh just
[2:34:40.800 --> 2:34:46.240]  to run of this show as the guy that tried to stop this deep state coup against america
[2:34:46.240 --> 2:34:50.160]  on what's currently happening how do you think they're going to respond back to this what is
[2:34:50.160 --> 2:34:55.040]  hillary what does obama do because what do you call this that's my first question in this segment
[2:34:55.840 --> 2:35:02.000]  call it obama spy gate hillary spy gate uh do we call this uh deep state coup against america
[2:35:02.000 --> 2:35:07.680]  what do we call this scandal of scandals you know that's a good question somebody
[2:35:07.680 --> 2:35:14.400]  um who's good at this stuff will put a handle on it and that handle will last uh but the law will
[2:35:14.400 --> 2:35:21.920]  call this a conspiracy and an agreement uh to break laws and that's really the danger to mrs
[2:35:21.920 --> 2:35:31.440]  clinton uh because if this conspiracy continued on into 2017 probably up to the time that uh
[2:35:31.440 --> 2:35:38.880]  president trump fired jim comey which is may of 17 well that's fewer than five years ago
[2:35:39.440 --> 2:35:46.320]  five years is the statute of limitations so the statute begins to run when the crime is committed
[2:35:46.320 --> 2:35:50.880]  if you pull a trigger and kill somebody that's when the crime is committed uh but if it takes
[2:35:50.880 --> 2:35:56.000]  that person two or three months to die the statute of limitations doesn't start to run
[2:35:56.000 --> 2:36:04.640]  until they die if you have a conspiracy uh to interfere with a valid election of a president
[2:36:04.640 --> 2:36:10.800]  of the united states i'm talking about the election of donald trump in 2016 and that conspiracy
[2:36:10.800 --> 2:36:19.520]  continues into 2017 even after he's the president well that is fewer than five years ago because
[2:36:19.520 --> 2:36:26.320]  the statute of limitations is five years so those who are uh breathing a sigh of relief
[2:36:26.880 --> 2:36:32.800]  probably have more to worry about than they think they do when uh john ratcliffe the former
[2:36:32.800 --> 2:36:37.680]  congressman from texas and former director of national intelligence over donald uh under
[2:36:37.680 --> 2:36:44.880]  donald trump told my former colleagues at fox news just this past weekend that there may be
[2:36:44.880 --> 2:36:50.240]  some indictments coming i'm pretty sure that's ratcliffe uh i'm pretty sure that's what he was
[2:36:50.240 --> 2:36:57.040]  he was talking about so if mrs clinton and jake sullivan and and john brennan and and
[2:36:57.040 --> 2:37:04.400]  jim comey entered into an agreement in the fall of 2016 and that agreement carried into the
[2:37:04.960 --> 2:37:12.880]  presidency of donald trump until comey was fired in may of 2017 well may of 2017 is fewer than
[2:37:12.880 --> 2:37:19.840]  five years ago so durham then has time to present all of this to our grand jury and ask them to
[2:37:19.840 --> 2:37:27.680]  indict on the other hand if the conspiracy ended at the election of donald trump in november of
[2:37:27.680 --> 2:37:34.720]  16 well then those who want to see these characters prosecuted are out of luck but what durham is
[2:37:34.720 --> 2:37:40.800]  saying is this continued on into the white house and and if you look at this uh and the things they
[2:37:40.800 --> 2:37:45.760]  said and did i mean i think i think that's where durham's going what do you think's happening i think
[2:37:45.760 --> 2:37:51.840]  that's where he's going as well uh and he he very well very well may be targeting the the
[2:37:51.840 --> 2:38:00.800]  former president of brock obama i mean if brock obama convened a group of people if if he convened
[2:38:00.800 --> 2:38:06.400]  a group of people in the oval office which included jack brennan whom you see there then the head of
[2:38:06.400 --> 2:38:15.440]  the uh cia uh jim call me the head of the fbi mrs clinton jope biden jake sullivan and himself and
[2:38:15.440 --> 2:38:23.040]  they agreed to use the assets of the federal government to spy on and thus undermine the
[2:38:23.040 --> 2:38:29.280]  president elect who was about to become the president of the united states then we have a very
[2:38:29.280 --> 2:38:35.920]  very serious problem on our hands now let me let me suggest this to you we know the spying was going
[2:38:35.920 --> 2:38:44.320]  on at least up until the time of the inauguration because two days after the inauguration is the
[2:38:44.320 --> 2:38:51.760]  fbi's infamous visit to general flinn in his office in the white house and they were able
[2:38:52.720 --> 2:38:59.680]  to ask him questions and get him to contradict what they knew he had said on the phone to the
[2:38:59.680 --> 2:39:06.240]  russian ambassador just a week or so before so were they spying on the russian ambassador
[2:39:06.240 --> 2:39:11.360]  or spying on general flinn after he was it was announced he was going to be the chief uh the
[2:39:11.360 --> 2:39:16.080]  national security advisor to president then president elect trump or were they spying on both
[2:39:19.040 --> 2:39:23.440]  i know you don't like to speculate but just as a guy that's been around the block a few times
[2:39:23.440 --> 2:39:27.280]  gut level where do you think this goes who do you think is most concerned because i remember
[2:39:27.280 --> 2:39:33.520]  things like jim comey testifying to congress i i i never talked to the press i'm not involved in
[2:39:33.520 --> 2:39:38.480]  leaking and later well i did call the head of a major university so he could tell the press
[2:39:38.480 --> 2:39:43.680]  well that's the same thing and i'm a mafia boss and i tell my underling to go have somebody killed
[2:39:43.680 --> 2:39:48.640]  i'm just as guilty so i don't get out comey tells congress i never leaked i just leaked through
[2:39:48.640 --> 2:39:58.720]  somebody else that doesn't make sense well look john durham uh would have been unwise to have
[2:39:58.720 --> 2:40:04.560]  filed the document that he did last friday laying all this out a if he couldn't prove it and b if
[2:40:04.560 --> 2:40:09.600]  he wasn't prepared to prove it because he doesn't really need to go through this just to prove that
[2:40:09.600 --> 2:40:16.960]  this fellow michael susman told a lie to the then general counsel of the fbi you know there's one
[2:40:16.960 --> 2:40:22.400]  thing about prosecutors and this is good and bad they they always like to prove their worth
[2:40:22.960 --> 2:40:29.600]  i mean it is the rare prosecutor that spends a fortune that's durham that spends a fortune
[2:40:29.600 --> 2:40:35.840]  in government money to investigate and that doesn't indict because then he's got to justify what the
[2:40:35.840 --> 2:40:40.880]  hell did you spend all that money on we're saying they have their case and just like a mafia case
[2:40:40.880 --> 2:40:44.400]  they're going after the clinton lawyer and then to clinton and then to obama
[2:40:44.400 --> 2:40:50.160]  you know a brennan all the deep state players i think there's a rational argument
[2:40:50.880 --> 2:40:57.200]  to support that alex you said it better than i could uh look just in those days when i made
[2:40:57.200 --> 2:41:03.440]  these allegations about the the the brit spying on trump well there's jim clapper in the middle
[2:41:03.440 --> 2:41:12.240]  now he's skated he lied under oath when he was asked by a liberal democratic uh senator widen
[2:41:12.240 --> 2:41:20.640]  uh from oregon does the government spy on americans and he said no and then he said not
[2:41:20.640 --> 2:41:25.760]  wittingly and then about a month or so later he in a letter apologized and admitted he had
[2:41:25.760 --> 2:41:31.120]  lied under oath and they decided not to prosecute him that event was well more than five years ago
[2:41:31.120 --> 2:41:39.440]  but that was public perjury over information that we all knew he was lying about the questioner
[2:41:39.440 --> 2:41:44.880]  senator widen knew he was lying about it anybody that followed edwards note knew that he was lying
[2:41:44.880 --> 2:41:51.440]  about it but here's what i was saying before your producers put up the photograph of jim clapper
[2:41:53.600 --> 2:42:02.720]  the the concept that that prosecutors need to justify their worth is well known in the legal
[2:42:02.720 --> 2:42:08.880]  community durham is a is a lifelong prosecutor i don't think he would have put that stuff out there
[2:42:08.880 --> 2:42:15.600]  last friday if he didn't intend to demonstrate it and he can and if if uh susband pleads guilty
[2:42:16.160 --> 2:42:21.840]  then then durham's only forum in which to demonstrate this will be a trial against somebody else who
[2:42:21.840 --> 2:42:27.120]  he has yet to indict and the whole question is statute limitations but if you get into ongoing
[2:42:27.120 --> 2:42:31.600]  you know they were spying after that that will lead to the later spying during the four years of
[2:42:31.600 --> 2:42:37.120]  trump and then now it's a bunch of other investigations judge andrew depolitano is on fire
[2:42:37.120 --> 2:42:41.600]  and is the phoenix vindicated i mean oh wow i remember when he came out and said they were
[2:42:41.600 --> 2:42:45.600]  spying on trump with evidence that said that guy's not gonna be on air very long and he wasn't
[2:42:45.600 --> 2:42:50.080]  but he is still on air and and regrowing his show we really support him and appreciate him
[2:42:50.080 --> 2:43:00.160]  we'll be right back stay with us the globalist social engineers always intended to push their
[2:43:00.160 --> 2:43:07.680]  covid biomedical tyranny lockdowns until the populations rebelled they would then use that
[2:43:07.680 --> 2:43:14.000]  as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out
[2:43:14.000 --> 2:43:18.880]  against their lives but because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others
[2:43:19.440 --> 2:43:25.200]  coming public and and whistleblowers now their whole project is falling apart because the people
[2:43:25.200 --> 2:43:32.320]  are aware that it is a world government corporate takeover and so it's pulling back the curtain
[2:43:32.320 --> 2:43:37.200]  now more than ever the problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on
[2:43:37.200 --> 2:43:44.080]  their takeover like canada but they've now declared a civil emergency and martial law in ontario
[2:43:44.080 --> 2:43:49.040]  and other areas of the world are following suit like australia so pray for these folks big time
[2:43:49.040 --> 2:43:54.240]  it's a very serious situation and stay tuned into info wars dot com because truth is absolutely
[2:43:54.240 --> 2:44:01.120]  paramount the purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of today
[2:44:01.120 --> 2:44:06.960]  half the population has lined up for an untested deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[2:44:06.960 --> 2:44:12.560]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease the perpetrators of all this
[2:44:12.560 --> 2:44:17.600]  have clearly stated their goal of having 80 percent of the population hooked up to an artificial
[2:44:17.600 --> 2:44:23.520]  intelligence hive mind in less than nine years for those of us who have awoken from the spell
[2:44:23.520 --> 2:44:28.320]  we know this is all really happening and it's unbelievably unsettling to see but there is
[2:44:28.320 --> 2:44:34.320]  only two things to do we continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game if enough people
[2:44:34.320 --> 2:44:40.160]  awaken from the cold spell then we win but even when we win and we eventually will the days of

[2:46:51.920 --> 2:47:02.080]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:47:02.080 --> 2:47:27.280]  well i won't back down no i won't back down you can stand me up at the gates of hell
[2:47:27.280 --> 2:47:37.280]  but i won't back down gonna stand my ground well you know i admire people that are male female
[2:47:37.280 --> 2:47:42.480]  black white hispanic asian old young you know they are they're the trailblazers they're the mavericks
[2:47:42.480 --> 2:47:49.040]  so the people that time and time again i watch it and listen to or observe in life who are being
[2:47:49.040 --> 2:47:52.880]  truthful that are being honest and that really know what they're talking about that's who i admire
[2:47:52.880 --> 2:47:57.200]  more and more though the corporate media is dying even fox's ratings are down but nothing
[2:47:57.200 --> 2:48:02.240]  compared to cnn with a hundred thousand viewers on average msnbc because people know that's not
[2:48:02.240 --> 2:48:07.520]  genuine it's okay we make mistakes sometimes but the people know we're trying to tell them the truth
[2:48:07.520 --> 2:48:15.200]  because we respect them because we respect ourselves and judge janer napolitano got phased out
[2:48:15.200 --> 2:48:20.000]  because that was the move he made telling the truth when everybody else knew trump was being
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:24.000]  spied on they bragged they were spying on him oh we know he's a russian we're spying on him
[2:48:25.200 --> 2:48:30.240]  napolitano's like boom i got you goes and looks it up goes after them they come after him so
[2:48:30.800 --> 2:48:35.920]  people want men and women to do the right things but then when we do the right things some people
[2:48:35.920 --> 2:48:40.560]  don't back us so i don't you don't want to talk about yourself all day judge napolitano but
[2:48:40.560 --> 2:48:45.600]  any other points about the derm investigation how big this is other key angles and then i just want
[2:48:45.600 --> 2:48:50.560]  to ask you in closing in the 10 minutes we have left or nine minutes we have left just in general
[2:48:50.560 --> 2:48:56.800]  your view on vaccine mandates and open borders and biden's low approval rating and just any other
[2:48:56.800 --> 2:49:01.040]  i mean because i can talk to you for 10 hours about things happening in the world and just your
[2:49:01.040 --> 2:49:08.080]  view of where humanity is right now judge well alex uh you know you and i have been friends for years
[2:49:08.080 --> 2:49:16.560]  and i have admired your work for years and you also have suffered at the hands of of people who
[2:49:16.560 --> 2:49:22.480]  press buttons in the world because you've not hesitated to tell the truth and i think the
[2:49:22.480 --> 2:49:27.760]  overwhelming majority of the people watching and listening to us now would agree with what i just
[2:49:27.760 --> 2:49:34.320]  said about you you are a hero to many many many people your ratings are astronomical and that's
[2:49:34.320 --> 2:49:40.240]  because you always say what you believe to be the truth and you have the means with which to back it
[2:49:40.240 --> 2:49:47.040]  up you know other than what i said about knowing the prosecutorial mindset and knowing that john
[2:49:47.040 --> 2:49:53.040]  Durham has that mindset he needs to justify himself i really don't think he's going to stop
[2:49:53.840 --> 2:50:00.800]  at the indictment of michael susman hillary clinton's former campaign lawyer for what's
[2:50:00.800 --> 2:50:06.400]  considered a low-level crime because the punishment is is often not even incarceration
[2:50:07.680 --> 2:50:13.520]  lying to the fbi if you lie to the fbi and send them on a wild goose chase and they spent a fortune
[2:50:15.120 --> 2:50:20.560]  chasing down your lie well then they're going to come after you very aggressively but if the fbi
[2:50:20.560 --> 2:50:25.840]  knows at the moment you lie to them that it was a lie then they're not going to come after you
[2:50:25.840 --> 2:50:31.360]  aggressively uh unless they have nothing else to come after you for so during the reagan administration
[2:50:31.360 --> 2:50:37.360]  there's a famous arrest on a on a brooklyn street corner uh in the years in the days and we used to
[2:50:37.360 --> 2:50:43.840]  have phone booths the fbi had cornered a major columbian the drug dealer uh but they had no
[2:50:43.840 --> 2:50:48.080]  evidence they knew in their hearts who he was but they had no evidence with which to arrest him
[2:50:48.080 --> 2:50:52.640]  he got out of the phone booth and an fbi agent went up to him and said hey buddy what's your name
[2:50:52.640 --> 2:51:01.920]  and he said nancy reagan and they arrested him for lying to the fbi that that led to the acquisition
[2:51:01.920 --> 2:51:07.760]  of evidence against him in a prosecution on a lifetime sentence but without some hook on which
[2:51:07.760 --> 2:51:12.800]  to hang their hats uh which came out of his own mouth they wouldn't have been able to do it on
[2:51:12.800 --> 2:51:17.920]  the other hand if they want to frame you as you know they can and have done as they did to martha
[2:51:17.920 --> 2:51:24.560]  steward as they would try to do uh to you uh then then your best bet is not to talk to them
[2:51:25.120 --> 2:51:28.480]  okay i'm glad you raised that because that's the question i meant to ask you and i've forgotten
[2:51:28.480 --> 2:51:33.040]  what do you make of january 6 i've been subpoenaed uh we offered him hey you want my emails with all
[2:51:33.040 --> 2:51:36.960]  my text messages i'll give you written statement answers but i'm not going to have you twist this
[2:51:36.960 --> 2:51:42.080]  and do a perjury uh trap and they just didn't do that so now they may give me immunity i don't even
[2:51:42.080 --> 2:51:46.240]  know anything i wasn't i mean we tried to have peaceful demonstrations what do you make of this
[2:51:46.240 --> 2:51:51.200]  january 6 and now that they've got the new terrorism directive by the president saying
[2:51:51.200 --> 2:51:56.960]  questioning elections or questioning lock nouns is terror and then trudeau's declared a civil
[2:51:56.960 --> 2:52:01.200]  emergency uh and they're going to grab bank accounts without court orders what do you make
[2:52:01.200 --> 2:52:09.920]  of this client of this climate well the climate is reprehensible it's totalitarianism uh on steroids
[2:52:09.920 --> 2:52:16.640]  you and our mutual friend and colleague in my case a boyhood friend uh roger stone
[2:52:17.360 --> 2:52:22.880]  did the right thing when the committee summons you don't play footsie with them uh the way mark
[2:52:22.880 --> 2:52:28.800]  meadows was a decent decent human being i've known mark since his early days in in congress
[2:52:28.800 --> 2:52:33.280]  don't play footsie with them don't give them some things and then decide to throw up your hands if
[2:52:33.280 --> 2:52:38.640]  you don't like the questions they're answering you don't answer a single question except who you are
[2:52:38.640 --> 2:52:44.320]  and how they can reach you that's the way you uh and roger stone dealt with it in terms of trudeau
[2:52:44.320 --> 2:52:51.520]  he's just as bad as his father uh there there's no national emergency the statute itself defines
[2:52:51.520 --> 2:52:59.120]  national emergency as one where the government is unable to protect the security and freedom
[2:52:59.680 --> 2:53:06.160]  of canada not one in which the roads are clogged uh but that statute which he has triggered gives
[2:53:06.160 --> 2:53:14.080]  him tremendous power as you say to arrest without warrant or evidence and without preferring charges
[2:53:14.080 --> 2:53:21.520]  against the people uh arrested uh to confiscate bank accounts to scoff confiscate trucks to confiscate
[2:53:21.520 --> 2:53:27.120]  insurance policies on the trucks which of course is insane because then you got a 16 wheeler on the
[2:53:27.120 --> 2:53:35.600]  highway without insurance on it so well uh he's he's just uh reprehensible in terms of uh the
[2:53:35.600 --> 2:53:40.240]  vaccines have been campaigning against them for a long time it's not a vaccine as you have said
[2:53:40.240 --> 2:53:46.800]  a vaccine gives you a small dose of the disease your body fights it off you have the immunity
[2:53:46.800 --> 2:53:53.120]  and the antibodies forever this is a chemical cocktail which is an experiment at lessening
[2:53:53.120 --> 2:53:58.240]  the effects of the disease it doesn't prevent you from getting it it doesn't prevent you from
[2:53:58.240 --> 2:54:04.480]  from transmitting it the supreme court has ruled several times you control your own body
[2:54:04.480 --> 2:54:09.200]  you decide what goes into it the government of the united states of america signed a treaty
[2:54:09.200 --> 2:54:14.960]  called the nuremberg protocols which prohibit the the use of government compulsion to take
[2:54:14.960 --> 2:54:23.440]  experimental chemicals into the body so we are on very solid ground legally and morally but
[2:54:23.440 --> 2:54:30.080]  big government big pharma and big medicine have persuaded the the public that they are right
[2:54:30.080 --> 2:54:37.360]  and we are wrong so again it takes courage the truck drivers in canada have to be courageous
[2:54:37.360 --> 2:54:44.240]  people like you need to be courageous uh people listening to us now need to recognize that they
[2:54:44.240 --> 2:54:50.080]  decide what goes in their bodies not dr. Fauci and not the government beautifully said i i see

[3:00:38.800 --> 3:00:43.840]  email box and i i didn't watch it because i was too busy and then i watched it saturday morning
[3:00:45.280 --> 3:00:50.640]  and it made me physically sick because when i watched it tens of thousands of pieces of data
[3:00:50.640 --> 3:00:57.280]  came into my little brain and i remembered all the leftist shows celebrating the euthanasia of
[3:00:57.280 --> 3:01:03.920]  down syndrome people humans and you know if we kill the least of us and i'm not saying that the
[3:01:03.920 --> 3:01:11.040]  least of us that's a christ quote we see it as a least of us they've done that to christ and so uh
[3:01:12.160 --> 3:01:15.920]  we're going to air that coming up in the uh last segment of this hour

[3:01:39.920 --> 3:01:44.880]  now they literally put her on a bioethics chart because you know what's worse than being white right
[3:01:45.920 --> 3:01:50.640]  in the official bioethics boards of a lot of lot i don't know how many but it's a lot of them
[3:01:50.640 --> 3:01:54.560]  i don't have the statistics because they're not out they just a lot of your big hospital groups
[3:01:56.720 --> 3:02:01.680]  do not give medical care to white people now whether it's animal monoclonial antibodies you
[3:02:01.680 --> 3:02:07.040]  name it and they say right there i've heard dutch tv british tv they're like hey you're a down
[3:02:07.040 --> 3:02:12.160]  syndrome man yeah yeah i am you know you cost five times more in the welfare on average
[3:02:13.040 --> 3:02:16.880]  why the hell did you let us create welfare to get rid of families so you could then say let's
[3:02:16.880 --> 3:02:21.680]  cut people off because we're collectivists oh you're a conservative you don't get hard surgery
[3:02:21.680 --> 3:02:26.640]  oh you didn't take a vaccine you don't get a kidney you don't get you know we know what you're
[3:02:26.640 --> 3:02:32.320]  doing you're getting it's dependent on you so you can cut stuff off we know that makes you
[3:02:32.320 --> 3:02:41.040]  let us feel real good to kill a down syndrome person on record sorry she's down syndrome
[3:02:42.320 --> 3:02:46.000]  she ain't getting medical care we need to get rid of this lady and that's what
[3:02:46.000 --> 3:02:52.080]  Bayer pharmaceutical 14 years ago they settled the cases and the documents were put out part
[3:02:52.080 --> 3:02:57.200]  of the settlement because the families didn't want a bunch of money they wanted to stop unlike
[3:02:57.200 --> 3:03:02.080]  other people that sue everybody and it was in france it was in australia and a couple other
[3:03:02.080 --> 3:03:08.080]  canada they fire bombed the hemophiliac society for exposing it but that didn't stop them that
[3:03:08.080 --> 3:03:13.440]  it intimidated them and they released the documents where australia and france the executives were
[3:03:13.440 --> 3:03:18.480]  talking to each other and they said well we've infected millions of ampules of factor eight with
[3:03:18.480 --> 3:03:24.000]  hiv and hepatitis and it's going to be a death sentence for millions of people and the head god
[3:03:24.000 --> 3:03:28.400]  came back and said there's too many hemophiliacs let's get rid of them they went yeah let's do it
[3:03:34.880 --> 3:03:41.840]  oh my god so now because you bleed too much you get to die or because you got an extra chromosome
[3:03:41.840 --> 3:03:48.000]  you get to die yeah i got an idea how about the people that want to kill everybody start dying
[3:03:48.800 --> 3:03:52.960]  because i don't need to kill people to feel powerful i've already got all that genetics
[3:03:52.960 --> 3:03:57.840]  i've already got all that handled that's like low level stuff i got it's it's in the arsenal
[3:03:57.840 --> 3:04:03.840]  it's sitting right there it's the best you can get the best at war the best at killing the best at
[3:04:03.840 --> 3:04:09.360]  operations the best at everything that's low level but you know what's harder growing crops
[3:04:09.360 --> 3:04:14.400]  taking care of children designing technology stepping up for weak people that's what's hard
[3:04:16.560 --> 3:04:20.480]  not all you people that think screwing over weak people that's not strong
[3:04:22.080 --> 3:04:27.600]  now there's one thing i do before i'm dead we are gonna get you people that have done this to

[3:06:15.920 --> 3:06:28.800]  man thomas jefferson
[3:06:34.480 --> 3:06:38.000]  all right folks i got some really big news to hit right now on this
[3:06:38.000 --> 3:06:45.360]  tuesday emergency broadcast it is so incredibly intense you know i didn't let the covid news
[3:06:45.360 --> 3:06:49.680]  even though that's central get the way of the big broadcast today i hit all the other news
[3:06:50.560 --> 3:06:54.960]  the marshal law in canada which is a response of humans fighting the covid tyranny the
[3:06:54.960 --> 3:06:58.640]  russia pulling their trips back from the border of the media trying to spin that the durham
[3:06:58.640 --> 3:07:11.600]  investigation and so much more but uh wow i mean the news i'm seeing here is just beautiful human
[3:07:11.600 --> 3:07:20.800]  resistance to tyranny basically everywhere and that's a great thing but we could sit here and
[3:07:20.800 --> 3:07:27.360]  fight tyranny all day until we realize something that's really important in my view and that's
[3:07:27.360 --> 3:07:34.080]  that 90 of people serving evil actually believe those of us that are fighting them or the evil ones
[3:07:34.080 --> 3:07:41.600]  and so i just want to reach out to those new listeners and people that are tuning in want to
[3:07:42.160 --> 3:07:46.720]  find out what this how it shows things about today just to listen to me really really carefully
[3:07:47.520 --> 3:07:51.680]  and most of you i guess didn't get a chance growing up to run into this information
[3:07:51.680 --> 3:07:55.120]  and didn't get the head start i did but believe me i know what i'm talking about
[3:07:55.840 --> 3:08:01.040]  and believe me all i want is good for you and good for me and good for us together into the
[3:08:01.040 --> 3:08:07.120]  future and the people you're serving in the democratic party or the corporate systems worldwide
[3:08:07.120 --> 3:08:13.360]  are out to get you and are like robots they don't have any empathy and they don't care about you
[3:08:13.360 --> 3:08:17.440]  and they don't want to empower the oppressed they don't want to empower humanity because they're weak
[3:08:19.680 --> 3:08:26.960]  it's hard to care about people it's hard to be informed but the lazy just joined with evil and
[3:08:26.960 --> 3:08:31.680]  i know a lot of average low-level people join with evil too that's the big trick that the upper
[3:08:31.680 --> 3:08:37.120]  echelon of evil sells the low-level echelons of evil go ahead and be corrupt go ahead and be
[3:08:37.120 --> 3:08:42.160]  evil you'll get ahead but you're not getting ahead you are digging your grave and our collective
[3:08:42.160 --> 3:08:50.160]  graves deeper and deeper by the minute as you do that now i was sitting there as we came back
[3:08:50.160 --> 3:08:57.200]  from break looking for my covid stack because it's like five inches thick i don't know why i
[3:08:57.200 --> 3:09:02.240]  don't know why i can't find it it's just it's just too much but i do have the clips here at least
[3:09:02.240 --> 3:09:10.720]  look there's only like 25 of these that are all insane but here's a big one i've seen this medical
[3:09:10.720 --> 3:09:18.960]  doctor on australian national tv but he sounds like he's british he's got a british accent he's
[3:09:18.960 --> 3:09:21.920]  a medical doctor and i've seen him for the last year and a half warning of what was happening
[3:09:22.880 --> 3:09:28.480]  but the point is is that when i was sent this on twitter this morning by a friend i went there and
[3:09:28.480 --> 3:09:34.640]  it said sorry you can't see this it's not just oh this is dangerous click here if you want to not
[3:09:34.640 --> 3:09:38.960]  go to it click here if you want to it was oh this is dangerous you can't see it so then i
[3:09:40.240 --> 3:09:43.040]  searched what i saw in the headline and found another link
[3:09:43.040 --> 3:09:51.680]  but it said oh you can't share this this is disinformation why i'm a two-year-old and
[3:09:51.680 --> 3:09:55.440]  can't decide for myself what's true that they got a screenshot of it right here i'll pull it up
[3:09:59.680 --> 3:10:05.840]  now of course what did i do when this happened this morning i uh i got mad and i sent it out
[3:10:05.840 --> 3:10:12.720]  to about 20 people i know you'd pass all the dog and kid photos i got my phone here since this
[3:10:12.720 --> 3:10:22.560]  morning i take so many photos but uh yeah overhead shot this for me this is what it says on the one
[3:10:22.560 --> 3:10:29.600]  minute 53 second video if you can zoom in on that a little bit more it says learn why health officials
[3:10:29.600 --> 3:10:37.840]  consider COVID-19 vaccines safe for most people and then it says this tweet cannot be replied to
[3:10:37.840 --> 3:10:50.640]  shared or liked now what's he calling for he's calling for nuremberg too
[3:10:52.080 --> 3:10:56.240]  so what did i do when they did that i sent to the producers to grab the high quality club
[3:10:56.240 --> 3:11:01.840]  and then i sat there on a group text to more than a hundred major talk show host i know
[3:11:01.840 --> 3:11:09.840]  including joe rogan and i sent them that link now you could do that with your friends and family
[3:11:09.840 --> 3:11:16.480]  that action because i'm already seeing the effects will be a many times bigger than me talking about
[3:11:16.480 --> 3:11:20.480]  it today and i just point that out that even though i've got a big show and even though i've got this
[3:11:20.480 --> 3:11:26.480]  awesome audience of activists it's the stuff i do in the dirt at the point blank range is what i call
[3:11:26.480 --> 3:11:30.880]  it that has the biggest effect just like you are and i'm here to tell you when i pat you on the
[3:11:30.880 --> 3:11:36.800]  head and say you're amazing i'm not just saying that because you feel good about it you are everything
[3:11:36.800 --> 3:11:42.560]  when you decide to move when you decide to take action when you decide you're not laying down
[3:11:42.560 --> 3:11:48.960]  anymore i can feel your strength and it makes me stronger and i make you stronger and that is our
[3:11:48.960 --> 3:11:52.800]  communal spirit of liberty and freedom the holy spirit gave us we're not just meant to commune
[3:11:52.800 --> 3:11:59.280]  with god god has meant to direct us energize us and then we connect to others and that forms the
[3:11:59.280 --> 3:12:06.560]  body of christ and it's strong and it's got the future in its hand and it's got the destiny of
[3:12:06.560 --> 3:12:11.760]  our children and the will of who we are in this satanic new world order telling us we're racist
[3:12:11.760 --> 3:12:16.880]  and we're ugly and we're bad and we're genetically inferior and we need big pharma to save us is a
[3:12:16.880 --> 3:12:27.200]  lie and it must be and it will be resisted by simply saying no i see through you and i want to be
[3:12:27.200 --> 3:12:32.720]  persecuted by google and twitter and facebook i want to be lied about i want to be attacked not
[3:12:32.720 --> 3:12:40.160]  because it's fun but because i know that i'm in the fight when i'm getting hit if you're laying
[3:12:40.160 --> 3:12:46.400]  out on the beach not a care in the world counting all your little monies in the bank are you really
[3:12:46.400 --> 3:12:50.800]  happy and the answer is no those people are all empty as hell always chasing something that
[3:12:50.800 --> 3:12:55.120]  doesn't exist but when you're in the arena when you're in the fight when you're in god's will
[3:12:55.120 --> 3:13:02.880]  when you're following that journey when you're in that river of god's consciousness you are so
[3:13:02.880 --> 3:13:09.200]  empowered and so enlightened and so fulfilled and so strong it's embarrassing
[3:13:13.360 --> 3:13:19.520]  because you realize it's not you it's millisecond by millisecond they're like eons in god's mind
[3:13:19.520 --> 3:13:24.560]  god just empowering every atom in your body everything in your soul you literally exist
[3:13:24.560 --> 3:13:30.320]  because god millisecond to millisecond is creating you in his mind that's incredible
[3:13:30.320 --> 3:13:36.320]  and that's what you want to be part of forever because god is not a god of slavery but a free
[3:13:36.320 --> 3:13:44.880]  will and if you reject that consciousness god will spit you out and the worst thing in eternity
[3:13:44.880 --> 3:13:52.080]  the worst thing in existence in all dimensions is separation from god here is the censored video
[3:13:52.080 --> 3:13:59.200]  they don't want you to see about nuremberg too the science is settled there's an overwhelming
[3:13:59.200 --> 3:14:06.320]  consensus but nothing worked nothing could work nothing did work and nothing will work that includes
[3:14:06.320 --> 3:14:13.520]  the vaccinations which are not just unnecessary experimental untested and are actually killing
[3:14:13.520 --> 3:14:19.600]  people i want to take this moment to point a finger directly at the principal cause of why
[3:14:19.600 --> 3:14:28.160]  we're all here today and it's not the government no it's us physicians who have been intimidated
[3:14:28.160 --> 3:14:35.680]  by our colleges both provincially and internationally right if physicians had not been intimidated
[3:14:35.680 --> 3:14:41.040]  by the very body that's supposed to protect you from me if they've been allowed to speak their
[3:14:41.040 --> 3:14:47.120]  mind without the threat of losing their income and their positions then an individual patient
[3:14:47.120 --> 3:14:53.440]  such as you and me in a closed examining room would have been told the truth the truth
[3:14:54.560 --> 3:15:02.080]  they have been denied that ability to do that we have had that for centuries the two principal
[3:15:02.080 --> 3:15:07.040]  medical ethics have been trampled on by this government first do no harm and inform consent
[3:15:08.400 --> 3:15:14.800]  first do no harm is being trampled on the mandates have killed as we've heard more people
[3:15:14.800 --> 3:15:20.880]  many more people than than they say but informed consent i will put it to you how can you give
[3:15:20.880 --> 3:15:27.840]  informed consent if you are not informed and you have been denied information intentionally
[3:15:27.840 --> 3:15:34.000]  by the colleges that are supposed to protect you so i say this putting a point on it the
[3:15:34.000 --> 3:15:40.000]  colleges of physicians and surgeons across this country and internationally are co-conspirators
[3:15:40.000 --> 3:15:58.240]  with government in state sanctioned murder thank you it's time to show them what a real alpha

[3:20:29.360 --> 3:20:34.880]  happening in australia in the uk of the us you name it and he's come out and said you have a
[3:20:34.880 --> 3:20:40.480]  violation of the nuremberg code and the doctors that have gone along with this are guilty as well
[3:20:40.480 --> 3:20:47.440]  and they don't want the censored clip of him saying you are guilty so is big tech so is big
[3:20:47.440 --> 3:20:52.640]  pharma but also the doctors that know what's happening and are scared to tell people their
[3:20:52.640 --> 3:20:59.040]  cowardice now makes them people that are aiding and abetting this eugenics depopulation operation
[3:20:59.040 --> 3:21:06.160]  where they hope to corrupt the medical community by getting them involved in this evil her once
[3:21:06.160 --> 3:21:12.880]  they've covered up this lie well now they'll cover up any lie the clip is so important we're

[3:21:59.680 --> 3:22:05.680]  than injecting yourself every few months with something gives you meaning it's genuinely sad
[3:22:05.680 --> 3:22:13.600]  funny but also sad that's right here's another one just like a few weeks ago with magic johnson
[3:22:13.600 --> 3:22:19.680]  the mayor of la and the governor of the state didn't wear their mask and said oh we held our
[3:22:19.680 --> 3:22:26.000]  breath during it well they got caught again i guess holding their breath don't hold your breath
[3:22:26.000 --> 3:22:31.280]  they ever told the truth los angeles has an indoor mask mandate this is the mayor of los angeles

[3:22:53.280 --> 3:22:58.640]  tyranny but they don't have to wear the mask or take the shots but if you don't well you're
[3:22:58.640 --> 3:23:06.800]  going to starve to death and go to jail you're not like p ditty or 50 cent or matt daemon
[3:23:08.160 --> 3:23:13.040]  all the bunch that want to be elitist sitting around feeling powerful like lebron james like
[3:23:13.040 --> 3:23:17.840]  you know you're part of the winning crew now says ben afleck
[3:23:17.840 --> 3:23:24.240]  and again i'm not mad at all these people a lot of them are actually anti-mask
[3:23:26.400 --> 3:23:33.440]  continuing i comply because i want it to end the woman says to her it's because you comply
[3:23:33.440 --> 3:23:40.720]  that it will never end absolutely what does the big demersinsky say the technotronic era involves
[3:23:40.720 --> 3:23:45.920]  the gradual appearance of a more controlled society such as society would be dominated by the
[3:23:45.920 --> 3:23:51.520]  elite unrestricted by traditional values soon it will be possible to assert almost continuous
[3:23:51.520 --> 3:23:56.000]  surveillance over every citizen and maintain up-to-date complete files containing every
[3:23:56.000 --> 3:24:00.240]  and even the most personal information about the citizen these files will be subjected
[3:24:00.240 --> 3:24:08.480]  to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities between two ages 1970 and it goes on
[3:24:08.480 --> 3:24:17.280]  the child's swim meets telling them if you don't have all the shots we don't check your
[3:24:17.280 --> 3:24:24.640]  passport you can't be part of the swim team 50 million doses of vaccine recall for causing
[3:24:25.200 --> 3:24:29.920]  false hiv positives it's not false hiv positives and this is the next big story
[3:24:30.800 --> 3:24:34.240]  this is confirmed by medical doctors and people i've talked to that are about to come on air
[3:24:34.240 --> 3:24:43.520]  and of course in the discoverer of hiv said it hi katina katia i hope you don't mind messaging you
[3:24:43.520 --> 3:24:49.280]  hear about the recent hiv article you share as an enforce article i don't think i can comment

[3:25:13.520 --> 3:25:19.920]  and the doctors don't really know what to do about it apart from try different medication
[3:25:19.920 --> 3:25:26.320]  one of my patients with this told the consultant they were hadn't felt right after the second dose
[3:25:26.320 --> 3:25:37.920]  and suddenly the testing was a lot more it goes on we're only seeing this sort of thing in the

[3:30:10.160 --> 3:30:16.480]  martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives but because of
[3:30:16.480 --> 3:30:22.880]  so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers now
[3:30:22.880 --> 3:30:29.360]  their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government

[3:33:03.840 --> 3:33:14.240]  you have said talked a lot about security guarantees and now we've seen your proposals
[3:33:14.240 --> 3:33:20.240]  you also say you have no intention of invading ukraine so will you guarantee unconditionally
[3:33:20.240 --> 3:33:25.440]  that you will not invade ukraine or any other sovereign country or does that depend on how
[3:33:25.440 --> 3:33:32.080]  negotiations go and another question what is it do you think that the west does not understand
[3:33:32.080 --> 3:33:35.280]  about russia or about your intentions thank you
[3:33:40.960 --> 3:33:46.880]  speaking of the security guarantees and what it will depend upon or if something will depend upon
[3:33:46.880 --> 3:33:52.480]  the negotiations our actions will not depend on the negotiation they will depend on the
[3:33:52.480 --> 3:33:57.520]  unconditional compliance with the russian security demands today and in the historical
[3:33:57.520 --> 3:34:04.160]  context in this sense we have made it clear that any further NATO movement to the east is unacceptable
[3:34:05.280 --> 3:34:11.520]  there is nothing unclear about this we are not deploying our missiles over at the borders of
[3:34:11.520 --> 3:34:17.920]  the us no on the other hand the us is deploying its missiles close to our home on there on the
[3:34:17.920 --> 3:34:27.360]  porch of our house so are we demanding something excessive we're simply asking them not to deploy
[3:34:27.360 --> 3:34:34.480]  their tax systems over at our home what is so unusual or peculiar about that so what would the
[3:34:34.480 --> 3:34:43.200]  americans think if we for example decided to come to the border between say canada and the united
[3:34:43.200 --> 3:34:53.360]  states or mexico and simply deploy our missiles over there well does did mexico and the us never
[3:34:53.360 --> 3:34:59.840]  have any territorial disputes what about california what about texas did you forget about that but
[3:34:59.840 --> 3:35:05.200]  everything seems to have come down nobody remembers those things just like the way they remember about
[3:35:05.200 --> 3:35:14.240]  Crimea we try not to remember the situation in ukraine who created that who started the crisis
[3:35:14.240 --> 3:35:23.760]  uh was that lenin yes when it when he declared the soviet union in 1922 and then the constitution
[3:35:23.760 --> 3:35:32.560]  of 1924 following his death was following the principles of lenin this is a matter of security
[3:35:32.560 --> 3:35:39.200]  not just history this is about security it is not the negotiations that matter it is the outcome
[3:35:39.200 --> 3:35:48.960]  the result i've reiterated this many times and you're well aware that we said not an inch to the east
[3:35:49.600 --> 3:35:56.320]  that was the NATO guarantee in 1990 so what became of that they fooled us
[3:35:59.840 --> 3:36:05.760]  we've seen five waves of NATO expansion now they're in romania and in poland
[3:36:05.760 --> 3:36:11.440]  and they're deploying their relevant attack systems over there that's what we're talking about you
[3:36:11.440 --> 3:36:16.960]  should finally understand we're not threatening anyone we did not come to the us border so to the
[3:36:16.960 --> 3:36:23.680]  uk borders no they they came to our borders and now they're saying that ukraine will also join
[3:36:23.680 --> 3:36:28.640]  NATO and they will deploy their systems there or not just NATO they will simply deploy it on a
[3:36:28.640 --> 3:36:33.920]  bilateral basis they will deploy their military bases and their attack systems that's what we're
[3:36:33.920 --> 3:36:40.160]  talking about and you keep demanding some guarantees from us you must give us the guarantees
[3:36:40.160 --> 3:36:46.240]  it is up to you and you must do this immediately right now instead of keep talking about this for
[3:36:46.240 --> 3:36:54.160]  decades and they use this small talk and soft talk about the need for guarantees of security
[3:36:54.160 --> 3:36:59.760]  for everyone this is exactly what we mean we are not threatening anybody
[3:36:59.760 --> 3:37:05.520]  and now to the second part of your question could you repeat that please
[3:37:06.160 --> 3:37:11.040]  what is it that you think that the west does not understand about russia or about your intentions
[3:37:12.880 --> 3:37:19.440]  yes exactly well you know what we understand what you understand or what you don't understand
[3:37:19.440 --> 3:37:24.160]  sometimes it seems to me that will even two different worlds i was speaking about very
[3:37:24.160 --> 3:37:30.240]  obvious things how can you not understand that you say you will not expand and then you keep expanding
[3:37:31.040 --> 3:37:36.400]  you say we will have equal guarantees for everyone on the number of international agreements
[3:37:37.760 --> 3:37:44.320]  and then we see there is no equality or no equal security see here's the thing
[3:37:44.320 --> 3:37:55.200]  back in 1918 one of the assistants of Woodrow Wilson the US president said that the whole world
[3:37:55.200 --> 3:38:05.840]  would feel calmer and safer if today's enormous russia would be replaced with the states of
[3:38:05.840 --> 3:38:16.640]  Siberia and form more states in the european part of russia that was set in 1918 and in 1991
[3:38:16.640 --> 3:38:24.640]  we separated into 12 separate parts it seems to me that our partners were not satisfied with that
[3:38:24.640 --> 3:38:29.680]  they think that russia is at that too large even the european countries have turned themselves into
[3:38:29.680 --> 3:38:38.080]  a union of states they are quite small states with populations of 60 to 80 million people
[3:38:38.080 --> 3:38:44.880]  but even after the dissolution of the soviet union we only had 146 million people and that
[3:38:44.880 --> 3:38:51.280]  is too much for the west i think that is the only explanation for their constant pressure against us
[3:38:51.280 --> 3:38:58.000]  back in the 1990s the soviet union did everything it could to build normal relations with the west
[3:38:58.000 --> 3:39:03.600]  with the united states i will keep saying this and i will repeat for your viewers and listeners
[3:39:04.160 --> 3:39:08.880]  out there from from the media that you represent i didn't quite get that but that doesn't matter
[3:39:10.880 --> 3:39:20.720]  our nuclear sites our military nuclear sites had experts from the u.s intelligence authorities
[3:39:20.720 --> 3:39:26.640]  they were going there that was their job to visit the russian military nuclear sites they
[3:39:26.640 --> 3:39:34.000]  spent their whole days over there and the russian government had advices from the cia working inside
[3:39:34.000 --> 3:39:41.040]  of it what else did you need why did you have to support the terrorists in northern caucuses and use
[3:39:41.840 --> 3:39:48.480]  the terrorist organizations for to reach your goals and break down the russian federation
[3:39:48.480 --> 3:39:53.040]  this was exactly what you were doing and then as a former director of the fsb i know that
[3:39:53.040 --> 3:39:59.440]  we were working with the double agents and they were reporting to us on the tasks of the western
[3:39:59.440 --> 3:40:05.280]  intelligence agencies why did you have to do that you should have done something different
[3:40:05.280 --> 3:40:11.520]  perhaps treat russia as a possible ally and strengthen trust but no instead you tried to keep
[3:40:11.520 --> 3:40:17.040]  breaking us up and then you started the native expansion to the east was saying don't do that
[3:40:17.040 --> 3:40:22.640]  you had promised you wouldn't and they say where is it put in written form nowhere well then
[3:40:22.640 --> 3:40:31.040]  enough often we don't care about your concerns and every time we kept responding and trying to
[3:40:31.040 --> 3:40:40.080]  make obstacles we were expressing our concerns about that but they say no so you can do whatever
[3:40:40.080 --> 3:40:47.360]  you want about your concerns we will do whatever we need one two three four five we witnessed five
[3:40:47.360 --> 3:40:54.160]  waves of native expansion why can't they understand what is unclear i believe everything is clear
[3:40:54.160 --> 3:41:02.880]  we're thinking about our own security there are of course those who do not want us to speak
[3:41:02.880 --> 3:41:08.160]  we think just let me say even now orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns
[3:41:08.160 --> 3:41:14.000]  supposed to be on their way it's chances that damn it why because while the truncheon may be
[3:41:14.000 --> 3:41:20.560]  used in lieu of conversation words will always retain their power words are for the means to
[3:41:20.560 --> 3:41:28.640]  meaning and for those who will listen the enunciation of truth there is something terribly wrong
[3:41:28.640 --> 3:41:33.040]  with this country isn't that you decided sir you wanted it foolproof you told me every television
[3:41:33.040 --> 3:41:38.720]  in longer cruelty and injustice intolerance and oppression and where once you had the freedom to
[3:41:38.720 --> 3:41:44.240]  reject and to think and speak as you saw fit you now have sensors and systems of surveillance
[3:41:44.240 --> 3:41:49.120]  coercing your conformity and serve your submachine cameras how did this happen
[3:41:49.760 --> 3:41:55.040]  who's to blame well certainly there are those who are more responsible than others they will
[3:41:55.040 --> 3:42:00.880]  be held accountable but again truth be told if you're looking for the guilty you need only
[3:42:00.880 --> 3:42:09.920]  look into a mirror i know why you did it i know you were afraid who wouldn't be war terror disease
[3:42:10.560 --> 3:42:16.080]  there were a myriad of problems conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common
[3:42:16.080 --> 3:42:22.800]  sense fear got the best of you and in your panic you turn to the now high chancellor adam subtler
[3:42:23.360 --> 3:42:28.320]  he promised you border he promised you peace and all he demanded in return was your silent

[3:44:14.320 --> 3:44:20.400]  was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called but since taking your x2 for the
[3:44:20.400 --> 3:44:26.240]  last couple of years my skin is just really gorgeous actually people think i'm 55 years old
[3:44:27.440 --> 3:44:32.320]  and i was already taking your other supplements but i thought you know well maybe that's what i
[3:44:32.320 --> 3:44:37.120]  need to do because i just thought it was a hopeless situation but when i started taking it i mean it
[3:44:37.120 --> 3:44:43.120]  doesn't happen immediately but you know over a period of time i started noticing okay you know
[3:44:43.120 --> 3:44:49.040]  this is a ticket this is working this is wonderful you know i don't i don't have to put on derma
[3:44:49.040 --> 3:44:55.120]  blend anymore you know so anyway it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin
[3:44:55.120 --> 3:45:03.040]  and the globalist social engineers always intended to push their covid biomedical
[3:45:03.040 --> 3:45:10.240]  tyranny lockdowns until the populations rebelled they would then use that as the pretext
[3:45:10.240 --> 3:45:16.000]  for permanent martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their
[3:45:16.000 --> 3:45:21.680]  lives but because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public
[3:45:21.680 --> 3:45:27.680]  and whistleblowers now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware
[3:45:27.680 --> 3:45:34.160]  that it is a world government corporate takeover and so it's pulling back the curtain now more
[3:45:34.160 --> 3:45:39.440]  than ever the problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover
[3:45:39.440 --> 3:45:46.080]  like canada where they've now declared a civil emergency and martial law in ontario and other
[3:45:46.080 --> 3:45:51.520]  areas the world are following suit like australia so pray for these folks big time it's a very serious

[3:47:23.200 --> 3:47:32.240]  are receiving this transmission you are the resistance did she have coveted and was taken
[3:47:32.240 --> 3:47:38.400]  to the hospital or what happened that day we had tested grace for coveted and she was tested positive
[3:47:38.400 --> 3:47:43.680]  on october 1st at home we really didn't think anything of it because we were following the
[3:47:43.680 --> 3:47:50.640]  front line doctor's protocol to a t what happened was is day eight or nine somewhere in there she
[3:47:50.640 --> 3:47:57.360]  couldn't maintain her oxygen above 90 percent saturation they said we want to make grace the
[3:47:57.360 --> 3:48:02.560]  hospital i said well then i'll be i'll be staying with her and they said well you can't so what do
[3:48:02.560 --> 3:48:08.320]  you mean i can't and they said well our hospital protocol doesn't allow you to stay in the room
[3:48:08.320 --> 3:48:14.160]  i said well then i'll be taking grace home and unfortunately they came back you know i say
[3:48:14.160 --> 3:48:19.760]  unfortunately because grace died but unfortunately came back two hours later and said well we decided
[3:48:19.760 --> 3:48:25.360]  you can you can stay as long as you don't leave the room and so i said well that's of course fine
[3:48:25.360 --> 3:48:30.320]  i mean i'm not going anywhere with the full expectation i was going to catch coveted from
[3:48:30.320 --> 3:48:38.240]  grace that evening so this was the evening of october 7th we had a little bit of an issue
[3:48:38.240 --> 3:48:43.520]  in that grace was starting to get frustrated with the high flow nasal cannula they put this
[3:48:43.520 --> 3:48:51.200]  cannula on her that was shooting aero per nostrils at a high rate of pressure and you know she didn't
[3:48:51.200 --> 3:48:55.840]  want that so then we worked i worked with the nurses and the respiratory therapists on getting a
[3:48:55.840 --> 3:49:02.640]  bipap map to fix to fix that problem and ultimately it took about three and a half hours on and off
[3:49:02.640 --> 3:49:10.080]  and we finally got it situated so the morning of october 8th a doctor came in at eight o'clock
[3:49:10.080 --> 3:49:15.120]  and said your daughter is going to need to be on a ventilator in the next two hours and i said
[3:49:15.120 --> 3:49:21.920]  what is that what is that based on and he said it's based on the blood gas numbers that they
[3:49:21.920 --> 3:49:27.760]  drew the night before so what time did you draw them said 11 30 so we just got done wrestling
[3:49:27.760 --> 3:49:32.640]  with grace on and off for three and a half four hours i said i don't think those numbers are accurate
[3:49:32.640 --> 3:49:38.960]  her blood pressure was 235 over 135 her heart rate was 150 beats per minute i said that
[3:49:38.960 --> 3:49:44.880]  you guys took it at the worst possible times i i said i'd like to have those numbers taken again
[3:49:44.880 --> 3:49:50.720]  and so they read they took them at my request and she was of course fine so we dodged the the
[3:49:50.720 --> 3:49:57.680]  ventilator bullet uh the the next day at october 9th was another fairly significant event grace
[3:49:57.680 --> 3:50:05.520]  was great she got up she was pretty hungry didn't eat much today before and so i ordered food started
[3:50:05.520 --> 3:50:10.880]  feeding her and the nurse came running in and said you can't do that i said well what's the what's
[3:50:10.880 --> 3:50:17.360]  the reason and she said well because grace's oxygen saturation is only at 85 percent remember
[3:50:17.360 --> 3:50:22.160]  i told you i had my oxygen saturation meter so i put it on her finger and it read 95 percent
[3:50:22.800 --> 3:50:27.840]  so i called the nurse and i said is my meter accurate she said yes i said well why is my
[3:50:27.840 --> 3:50:36.640]  $50 meter more accurate than your $50,000 meter and she said well the leads get sweaty and so
[3:50:36.640 --> 3:50:42.160]  these type of things happen i said wow i said you got to be kidding me i said if you know that
[3:50:42.720 --> 3:50:47.120]  why don't you just trade these leads out every every four hours or whatever it takes so that
[3:50:47.120 --> 3:50:53.280]  you have an accurate reading this is the single most important statistic that you are using to
[3:50:53.280 --> 3:50:59.760]  manage my daughter's care and she snotily responded you should just be thankful you caught this she's
[3:50:59.760 --> 3:51:05.840]  on 1.4 units of prosthetics they give her two doses of lorazepam three minutes apart
[3:51:05.840 --> 3:51:13.280]  i mean it had to be a mistake i'm guessing i don't know then at 615 they give her two milligrams
[3:51:13.280 --> 3:51:18.800]  of morphine as a ivy push which means they gave it to her instantly not as a drip the morphine
[3:51:18.800 --> 3:51:25.760]  package insert is so condemning to what they did it says to not do this specifically don't
[3:51:25.760 --> 3:51:33.200]  combine it with prosthetics or lorazepam because it causes death jessica now jessica is in the
[3:51:33.200 --> 3:51:38.720]  room as the advocate itself in 20 she calls us panicking because grace's numbers are just dropping
[3:51:39.440 --> 3:51:45.040]  and so just my wife and i are what you know on face time saying get the nurses in she said
[3:51:45.040 --> 3:51:49.360]  dad i can't get them in they won't come in so now we're hollering save our daughter
[3:51:49.360 --> 3:51:55.680]  and they holler back she's dnr do not resuscitate that's the first time that's the first we know
[3:51:55.680 --> 3:52:03.360]  sick this is so sick so you know ultimately seven minutes go by we watch grace die on
[3:52:03.360 --> 3:52:20.720]  face time at 7 27 that evening the 2022 winter olympics in beijing will one day be written
[3:52:20.720 --> 3:52:26.400]  in the history books as they parade celebrating the point at which the united states lost its
[3:52:26.400 --> 3:52:32.320]  ability to perceive reality and embrace the impending doom brought on by this selling out
[3:52:32.320 --> 3:52:39.280]  of its most powerful assets by a self-serving treasonous elite class of baby boomer politicians
[3:52:39.280 --> 3:52:46.960]  and economic prostitutes i would say to our athletes you're there to compete do not risk
[3:52:47.840 --> 3:52:53.440]  incurring the anger of the chinese government because they are ruthless i know there is a
[3:52:53.440 --> 3:53:01.280]  temptation on the part of some to speak out while they are there i respect that but i also worry
[3:53:01.280 --> 3:53:08.000]  about what the chinese government might do to their reputations to their families and nobody
[3:53:08.000 --> 3:53:11.920]  cares about what's happening to the leakers okay you bring it up because you really care and i
[3:53:11.920 --> 3:53:16.320]  think that's nice that you care the rest of us don't care i'm just i'm telling you a very hard
[3:53:16.320 --> 3:53:20.640]  hard i'm telling you personally don't care i'm telling you a very hard ugly truth okay of all
[3:53:20.640 --> 3:53:26.080]  the things that i care about yes it is below my line the irony of statements like these is that
[3:53:26.080 --> 3:53:33.920]  the very ccp tyranny they either ignore or bow down to is already in the united states as those
[3:53:33.920 --> 3:53:39.920]  rightfully exercising their first amendment still await the communist style circus of the january
[3:53:39.920 --> 3:53:46.080]  sixth committee you can't lock up a whole group of people and somehow identify them as as terrorists
[3:53:46.080 --> 3:53:51.520]  in advance a terror event on your own people to prevent terrorism just that doesn't make sense
[3:53:51.520 --> 3:53:57.280]  and we won't ignore what our intelligence agents yet determined to be the most lethal
[3:53:57.280 --> 3:54:04.880]  terrorist threat to the homeland today white supremacy is terrorism if you aren't up to speed
[3:54:04.880 --> 3:54:12.800]  china's policy of mass genocide is skyrocketing after killing a reported 1.2 million tibetans
[3:54:15.280 --> 3:54:21.120]  the chinese army continued its progress towards lasa in a peaceful march that the chinese news
[3:54:21.120 --> 3:54:27.280]  broadcast to their people it was with more curiosity than animosity that the tibetan population
[3:54:27.920 --> 3:54:34.560]  isolated from the world for centuries watched the arrival of these strange invaders posing as
[3:54:34.560 --> 3:54:40.800]  liberators and imprisoning two million Uighurs in the largest network of forced labor detention
[3:54:40.800 --> 3:54:46.800]  camps on the face of the earth these satellite images show the site where terson i says she was
[3:54:46.800 --> 3:54:53.200]  held sharing a cell with 13 other women with a bucket for a toilet and she's haunted by one image
[3:54:53.920 --> 3:55:00.160]  masked men coming down a camp corridor like this one after midnight there were three men
[3:55:01.760 --> 3:55:11.360]  not one but three they did whatever evil their mind could think of and they didn't spare any part of
[3:55:11.360 --> 3:55:19.840]  my body fighting it to the extent that it was disgusting to look at and imprisoning 5000 christians
[3:55:19.840 --> 3:55:26.560]  including 1000 christian leaders not to mention a myriad of horrific human rights abuses against
[3:55:26.560 --> 3:55:33.440]  the chinese people including forced abortion sterilization and organ extractions for over a
[3:55:33.440 --> 3:55:42.720]  decade the people's republic of china has publicly accused of acts of cruelty and wickedness that
[3:55:42.720 --> 3:55:52.320]  matched the cruelty and wickedness of medieval torturers and execution it stated with certainty
[3:55:52.320 --> 3:55:57.760]  that in china forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience has been practiced
[3:55:57.760 --> 3:56:04.080]  for a substantial period of time the report underscored that there were extraordinarily
