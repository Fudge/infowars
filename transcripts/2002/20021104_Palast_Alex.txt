[00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:04.732]  Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:04.732 --> 00:00:16.219]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.621]  Alright folks, I know we've got Eleanor and others that have been holding patiently.
[00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:20.722]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:00:20.722 --> 00:00:22.223]  We're going to have callers forward.
[00:00:23.698 --> 00:00:24.659]  Best-selling author.
[00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:26.100]  He's got a powerful website.
[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.464]  He's a top BBC investigative reporter.
[00:00:29.464 --> 00:00:33.508]  He's talked about Lord Wakeham, head of NM Rothschild, trying to censor him.
[00:00:33.508 --> 00:00:34.569]  He broke the story.
[00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:36.711]  One of the biggest stories of the last year.
[00:00:36.711 --> 00:00:39.734]  In fact, one of the biggest stories ever.
[00:00:39.734 --> 00:00:41.155]  And I'm serious when I say that.
[00:00:41.155 --> 00:00:43.818]  About a thousand pages getting leaked out of the World Bank.
[00:00:44.418 --> 00:00:53.363]  And, of course, the defection of Stiklitz, the chief economist at the World Bank, their plan to implode economies, their four-part plan.
[00:00:53.363 --> 00:01:02.869]  We're going to recap that today and get the latest developments from this investigative journalist, who I would call a populist, because, you know, Greg Palast is a hero of the left.
[00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:05.758]  But this guy went after Bill Clinton.
[00:01:05.758 --> 00:01:16.367]  He exposes this corporate elite that is big government, that is socialistic in their consolidation of the public trust, then consolidating that into their private hands.
[00:01:16.367 --> 00:01:25.234]  We're dealing with a command and control system, ladies and gentlemen, and he does real investigative journalism like they did in this country a hundred years ago.
[00:01:25.234 --> 00:01:25.915]  We're honored to have him.
[00:01:26.215 --> 00:01:41.948]  I wanted to, before we go to Greg Powell, say one more thing about the game Dungeon Keeper and these other games like Grand Theft Auto 3 where you go and you blow a prostitute's head off and you get bonus points and the games where you kidnap children and torture them to death.
[00:01:41.948 --> 00:01:44.830]  Folks, we must censor things like this, okay?
[00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:53.137]  Because the government's already moving to censor websites like mine that don't have anything, you know, profane or distasteful on it other than what the globalists are doing.
[00:01:54.231 --> 00:01:57.112]  Uh, and we'll have a debate about that in the third hour of the show today.
[00:01:57.112 --> 00:02:01.593]  But, uh, we just had somebody who designs video games call in and go, yeah, it's true.
[00:02:01.593 --> 00:02:04.233]  Dungeon Keeper, you really do kidnap children and torture them to death.
[00:02:04.233 --> 00:02:06.494]  Folks, this is the object of the game.
[00:02:06.494 --> 00:02:07.994]  What's happened to our society?
[00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:12.535]  We are a... This country is a bunch of degenerate, satanic Romans.
[00:02:12.535 --> 00:02:19.317]  We're entering this decadent cycle, and I'm trying to get people to wake up, because you don't want to live in a country that allows this type of stuff.
[00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.825]  This is pure tyranny, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:22.825 --> 00:02:31.299]  Greg, I know that's a bizarre caveat to throw in as you're sitting there on hold, but we had a big discussion of it in the last hour because people are being blown away by these video games.
[00:02:32.413 --> 00:02:34.414]  What's the latest info that you're working on, sir?
[00:02:34.414 --> 00:02:35.554]  Good to have you on.
[00:02:35.554 --> 00:02:37.555]  Okay, great to be on, Alex.
[00:02:37.555 --> 00:02:41.056]  And by the way, I have to say that I guess I'm not the darling of the left anymore.
[00:02:41.056 --> 00:02:43.837]  They're very upset with me.
[00:02:43.837 --> 00:02:46.958]  The problem is that my target is not the left or the right.
[00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:52.960]  My target is a very small, privileged elite which thinks that the globe is their toy.
[00:02:53.821 --> 00:03:02.963]  And I think that, you know, journalists, the old line, like you say, the old types of journalists, muckrakers, used to think that it was their job to uncover that stuff.
[00:03:02.963 --> 00:03:05.423]  And it's kind of going out of style.
[00:03:05.423 --> 00:03:12.384]  But I'm glad that you've opened up a chink in the electronic Berlin Wall here to get this information out.
[00:03:12.384 --> 00:03:14.125]  So I really do appreciate it.
[00:03:14.125 --> 00:03:17.205]  I've been working on a lot of things.
[00:03:17.205 --> 00:03:20.466]  One, I just came back from Caracas, Venezuela.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.902]  Uh, and, uh, they've been, uh, the, uh, U.S.
[00:03:24.902 --> 00:03:28.724]  government and the banks and the oil companies have been working out on the president of Venezuela.
[00:03:28.724 --> 00:03:32.726]  They, they, they, the communist, the dictator, and etc.
[00:03:32.726 --> 00:03:41.211]  What they don't tell you is the reason they're out after this guy is that he is not just the president of Venezuela, he's the president of OPEC.
[00:03:41.211 --> 00:03:47.454]  And, um, he has, uh, doubled the royalties on oil companies, uh, taking oil out of Venezuela.
[00:03:47.454 --> 00:03:49.015]  Not many people know that Venezuela is our
[00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.752]  The main supplier of oil in this hemisphere.
[00:03:51.752 --> 00:03:59.117]  Seven days before the attempted coup on the legitimately elected president of Venezuela, you said, look for a coup in the next month.
[00:03:59.117 --> 00:03:59.677]  That's right.
[00:03:59.677 --> 00:04:04.921]  And that transcript and that audio file are on the Select Interview section of InfoWars.com.
[00:04:04.921 --> 00:04:07.743]  Greg, how did you call that one with such precision?
[00:04:07.743 --> 00:04:09.865]  Well, actually, it wasn't a big guess.
[00:04:09.865 --> 00:04:16.370]  I just, now I can tell you, is that I got a call from, I spoke to the head of, the Secretary General of OPEC in Vienna.
[00:04:17.496 --> 00:04:24.401]  And he had received, um, Qaddafi had contacted him to threaten a boycott against the United States.
[00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:27.123]  Qaddafi's no great, wonderful guy.
[00:04:27.123 --> 00:04:31.646]  Um, and the head of OPEC reminded him that OPEC has now banned political boycotts.
[00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:34.188]  Nevertheless, the word got out to the U.S.
[00:04:34.188 --> 00:04:36.329]  And the head of OPEC realized, well, the first thing the U.S.
[00:04:36.329 --> 00:04:43.935]  is going to do to counter any threat of a boycott, or let's say if we do invade Iraq, those oil fields will be on fire, where do you suddenly find
[00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.781]  An extra million or two million barrels of oil.
[00:04:47.781 --> 00:04:54.223]  Our supposed friends, the Saudi Arabians, won't give us an extra drop if all our factories start shutting down.
[00:04:54.223 --> 00:04:56.523]  They'll be thrilled to see us go under the Saudis.
[00:04:56.523 --> 00:04:58.184]  So where do we get the oil?
[00:04:58.184 --> 00:05:06.206]  And the answer would be from Venezuela, which can produce an extra two million barrels of oil at the flick of a switch.
[00:05:06.206 --> 00:05:12.468]  But there is a fear in the Bush administration that the President of Venezuela will not
[00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:17.648]  Go along and give this oil to Exxon, which controls most of the oil in Venezuela.
[00:05:17.648 --> 00:05:21.209]  Well, let's expand on this point of him supposedly being a communist.
[00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:22.949]  Now, he's not a communist.
[00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:26.771]  Oh, no, he's a big, you know, he's a very religious Catholic.
[00:05:26.771 --> 00:05:31.472]  You know, he's from the old style of kind of progressive land reform guy.
[00:05:31.472 --> 00:05:38.194]  He believes in land reform and redistribution of wealth in Venezuela, where you have a teeny weeny elite.
[00:05:38.194 --> 00:05:40.135]  You can't compare it to the United States.
[00:05:40.135 --> 00:05:42.616]  You've got this tiny elite with giant plantations.
[00:05:43.423 --> 00:05:46.184]  Let me expand on that.
[00:05:46.184 --> 00:05:49.385]  Pointless of what his political persuasion is.
[00:05:49.385 --> 00:06:04.151]  I'm tired of this corporate elite, this Carlaw Group, CIA, Pan Axis, telling me that they're going to fight communists when they're telling us that China is our ally when they're selling political dissidents organs, giving nuclear reactors to North Korea.
[00:06:04.992 --> 00:06:06.053]  I'll watch the History Channel.
[00:06:06.053 --> 00:06:09.096]  They now admit the CIA actually put Mao into power.
[00:06:09.096 --> 00:06:10.277]  They put Fidel into power.
[00:06:10.277 --> 00:06:14.360]  They helped prop Ho Chi Minh up until 1963.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.962]  It's the same story over and over again.
[00:06:15.962 --> 00:06:19.065]  They call somebody a communist when they want the natural resources.
[00:06:19.065 --> 00:06:20.406]  Or now, I guess it's not communist.
[00:06:20.406 --> 00:06:22.488]  They call them terrorists.
[00:06:22.488 --> 00:06:31.916]  Yeah, and communist doesn't work too well anymore, especially when we are selling equipment to the Chinese who are pulling out the fingernails of Christian priests.
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:40.786]  And I just said two weeks ago, Greg Palast, that you can go ahead and have Taiwan, not China.
[00:06:40.786 --> 00:06:49.993]  Yeah, well you know, after all, the biggest nation supporting the Communist Chinese is the current administration, the White House.
[00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:51.534]  So now it's terrorism.
[00:06:51.534 --> 00:06:57.499]  But the President of Venezuela, and by the way, whether we like him or not, whether he's a wonderful guy or not, he is elected.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:07.949]  And when journalists did ask someone at the White House, surprisingly, how can you move to overthrow an elected official, elected president?
[00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:14.256]  And the White House response was, well, winning a majority of the vote does not make your government legitimate.
[00:07:14.256 --> 00:07:16.538]  That's a pretty interesting statement out of the White House.
[00:07:17.017 --> 00:07:18.117]  Yeah, we saw that before.
[00:07:33.521 --> 00:07:35.742]  But no question, out of Venezuela we're seeing this.
[00:07:35.742 --> 00:07:42.485]  Turkey, now we have an Islamic government that's taking over in Turkey.
[00:07:42.485 --> 00:07:44.806]  That's going to be really lovely.
[00:07:44.806 --> 00:07:45.866]  And how did that happen?
[00:07:45.866 --> 00:07:53.409]  That happened because the IMF and World Bank squeezed that nation until it screamed.
[00:07:53.409 --> 00:07:57.451]  My books, by the way, are very popular in Turkey because I try to explain what's going on.
[00:07:58.243 --> 00:07:59.524]  With the World Bank and the IMF.
[00:07:59.524 --> 00:08:01.245]  Well, I'll tell you what, let's explain it.
[00:08:01.245 --> 00:08:04.146]  Can we revert back to that interview about a year ago?
[00:08:04.146 --> 00:08:04.767]  Sure.
[00:08:04.767 --> 00:08:10.590]  Concerning the four-part World Bank-IMF plan and sticklets and break down those four points.
[00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:11.891]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[00:08:11.891 --> 00:08:13.972]  I mean, people are saying, why are the economies imploding?
[00:08:13.972 --> 00:08:16.093]  And the government's saying, give us control of your lives.
[00:08:16.093 --> 00:08:16.934]  We're here to save you.
[00:08:16.934 --> 00:08:19.155]  And their own documents show they're engineering it.
[00:08:19.155 --> 00:08:20.276]  Please go over that, sir.
[00:08:20.276 --> 00:08:22.437]  Okay, well, what happened is that about a year ago,
[00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:31.793]  I received a good thousand pages of documents from inside the World Bank and the IMF, the International Monetary Fund, based out of Washington.
[00:08:31.793 --> 00:08:43.938]  These are the two organizations which work in coordination with the WTO, the World Trade Organization, and they are in control of the world movement of capital.
[00:08:43.938 --> 00:08:49.880]  They are, in effect, the central banks and the Treasury Departments for the planet.
[00:08:50.541 --> 00:08:53.644]  Of course, they work very closely with banks out of New York.
[00:08:53.644 --> 00:08:56.767]  I say, of course, I've got to get this information from inside.
[00:08:56.767 --> 00:08:58.328]  So I'm looking at these documents.
[00:08:58.328 --> 00:09:01.571]  Well, it's the same private owners of the stocks of these banks.
[00:09:01.571 --> 00:09:04.594]  Dutch Royal Family, British Royal Family, and others.
[00:09:04.594 --> 00:09:08.097]  Well, what you have is that you have, in the documents I have,
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.381]  And I have some of them, you know, photocopied in my book.
[00:09:11.381 --> 00:09:12.862]  I'm going to try to get more on the web, etc.
[00:09:12.862 --> 00:09:15.364]  It's just been, I've just been kind of going through a bunch of stuff.
[00:09:15.364 --> 00:09:16.284]  GregPalast.com.
[00:09:16.284 --> 00:09:17.445]  GregPalast.com.
[00:09:17.445 --> 00:09:19.086]  I'll be putting up more.
[00:09:19.086 --> 00:09:20.186]  And by the way, the U.S.
[00:09:20.186 --> 00:09:24.449]  version of my book, much expanded, will be coming out in February.
[00:09:24.449 --> 00:09:31.493]  But in the meantime, for BBC Television and the Guardian newspapers, which is considered the most prestigious of papers on the planet,
[00:09:33.048 --> 00:09:41.872]  I received these documents, and they'd say, you know, official use only, don't look at this, you know, World Bank, you have to be authorized.
[00:09:41.872 --> 00:09:52.136]  And each cover, it says Argentina, Bolivia, Venezuela, Botswana, and it has all these nations, and it has for each nation an economic program.
[00:09:52.136 --> 00:09:57.938]  And you look at the economic program, and some of them have very, most of them have these very nice names, like Poverty Reduction Strategy.
[00:09:57.938 --> 00:10:00.179]  You think, boy, boy, they're really going to help out these.
[00:10:00.595 --> 00:10:01.015]  Nation.
[00:10:01.015 --> 00:10:03.656]  So why is it secret if they're going to be so helpful?
[00:10:03.656 --> 00:10:07.057]  Have you ever heard of anyone kind of secretly helping someone?
[00:10:07.057 --> 00:10:09.078]  So it's, why the secrecy?
[00:10:09.078 --> 00:10:22.282]  And you open the stuff up, and these are programs which point by point, I mean they go on sometimes 100 pages, and they have specific demands on each country, which if they don't agree to it, they call them conditionalities.
[00:10:22.282 --> 00:10:26.284]  And they average 114 conditionalities per nation.
[00:10:26.284 --> 00:10:30.105]  You get your international finance, it's cut off unless you agree to the whole package,
[00:10:31.245 --> 00:10:38.371]  And one nation after another, it required the sell-off of water systems, of electric systems to foreign operators.
[00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:48.380]  It required the sale of the banks to foreign operators, changing rules to allow banks to remove the capital from nations.
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:52.263]  And one of the most tragic cases I saw was Argentina, where the economy
[00:10:54.204 --> 00:10:56.725]  They call it the IMF riot.
[00:10:56.725 --> 00:10:58.906]  They know it's going to create riots.
[00:10:58.906 --> 00:11:10.712]  One of the things I should mention is that in the plan, we know, for example, in the case of Ecuador, it actually says that this will cause social unrest if you implement this plan.
[00:11:10.712 --> 00:11:16.975]  The former chief economist of the World Bank is named Joe Stiglitz.
[00:11:16.975 --> 00:11:19.156]  He's not some type of wacko.
[00:11:19.156 --> 00:11:21.497]  The man just won the Nobel Prize in economics.
[00:11:23.596 --> 00:11:29.364]  I spoke to him for hours at Cambridge University and at London School of Economics, where we both lectured.
[00:11:29.364 --> 00:11:31.026]  I'm an economist as well, by the way.
[00:11:31.929 --> 00:11:35.170]  And he basically said they have a plan, which they know.
[00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:37.230]  They called them internally IMF riots.
[00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:42.491]  They deliberately knew that these plans would set off riots and cause these capitals, these nations to burn down.
[00:11:42.491 --> 00:11:46.652]  And then that causes the economy to further implode and they have a consolidation.
[00:11:46.652 --> 00:11:49.432]  And then everything's up for sale cheap.
[00:11:49.432 --> 00:11:51.212]  Greg Palast will be back in just a few minutes.
[00:11:51.212 --> 00:11:52.353]  Stay right there.
[00:11:52.353 --> 00:11:53.333]  A lot more coming up.
[00:11:53.333 --> 00:11:54.233]  And then your calls, folks.
[00:11:54.233 --> 00:11:54.293]  800-259-9231.
[00:11:54.293 --> 00:11:54.953]  Stay with us.
[00:12:06.165 --> 00:12:06.906]  All right, folks.
[00:12:06.906 --> 00:12:07.406]  Welcome back.
[00:12:07.406 --> 00:12:10.207]  We're talking to Greg Paulus, investigative journalist for the BBC.
[00:12:10.207 --> 00:12:12.768]  Broken a lot of bombshell stories over the years.
[00:12:12.768 --> 00:12:15.369]  He's also a best-selling author of multiple books.
[00:12:15.369 --> 00:12:17.310]  The website's gregpaulus.com.
[00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:21.232]  Greg, have you seen the new Council on Foreign Relations report they put out about a week and a half ago?
[00:12:21.232 --> 00:12:23.153]  America still unprepared.
[00:12:23.153 --> 00:12:27.975]  America still endangered by Gary Hart and Rudman.
[00:12:27.975 --> 00:12:30.176]  Regarding Saudi Arabia?
[00:12:30.176 --> 00:12:33.037]  I just saw another one of their reports, but go ahead.
[00:12:33.037 --> 00:12:34.018]  We may be talking about different ones.
[00:12:34.497 --> 00:12:41.923]  Well, it just says that give total control to a select group of corporations under CFR control.
[00:12:41.923 --> 00:12:45.386]  Nationalize basically everything but have control in the private corporations.
[00:12:45.386 --> 00:12:48.368]  Put troops in all the factories and on the streets.
[00:12:48.368 --> 00:12:53.512]  Or, they say on page 31, 80 to 80 plus percent will die in major cities.
[00:12:53.512 --> 00:12:56.715]  They say if we follow their orders, only 20 percent of us are going to die.
[00:12:56.715 --> 00:12:59.497]  This is an incredibly chilling document.
[00:12:59.497 --> 00:13:00.578]  America still unprepared.
[00:13:00.578 --> 00:13:01.659]  America still in danger.
[00:13:01.659 --> 00:13:03.901]  Report on the Independent Task Force sponsored by the Council.
[00:13:04.541 --> 00:13:15.067]  Yeah, Alex, I know the Council on Foreign Relations is always doing a great job of saving us from ourselves.
[00:13:15.067 --> 00:13:17.368]  And in a democracy, I prefer the vote.
[00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:31.113]  Well, certainly in our Constitutional Republic, but what I'm trying to say here, Greg, Pallas, is that what's in the IMF plan for total takeover by the international banks is exactly what's in this 40-page report.
[00:13:31.113 --> 00:13:32.153]  Yeah, it's the same group.
[00:13:32.153 --> 00:13:35.754]  In fact, Stiglitz told me, you know, he would say, sit around with people in the U.S.
[00:13:35.754 --> 00:13:36.594]  Treasury.
[00:13:36.594 --> 00:13:47.016]  Also, Joe Stiglitz, who was the chief economist at the World Bank, he was in Clinton's cabinet as the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and he'd say, some of these top guys at Treasury, I can't give you the names he gave me.
[00:13:47.748 --> 00:13:49.089]  You'd recognize him.
[00:13:49.089 --> 00:13:53.273]  I would sit around and say, well, does this policy, how does this policy float with Citibank?
[00:13:53.273 --> 00:14:04.322]  They're literally sitting there, you know, at the Treasury Department, you know, like, you think, these guys didn't even hear themselves and understand what they were saying, or maybe they did and they just got so used to it.
[00:14:04.322 --> 00:14:11.868]  He says, this one is at the touchstone of our domestic and foreign economic policies, how it plays with Citibank.
[00:14:12.489 --> 00:14:14.170]  They actually believe in this stuff.
[00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:15.571]  I mean, that's one thing you have to understand.
[00:14:15.571 --> 00:14:17.273]  They believe that they are really saving us.
[00:14:17.273 --> 00:14:22.397]  I don't believe that they're doing it just because they're... It does make them all very rich.
[00:14:22.397 --> 00:14:26.059]  Like Robert Rubin, I think he's making $100 billion a year.
[00:14:26.059 --> 00:14:26.800]  He goes from the U.S.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.581]  Treasury to Citibank.
[00:14:28.581 --> 00:14:30.243]  And he doesn't see that as a conflict.
[00:14:30.243 --> 00:14:32.644]  He sees that as helping the world.
[00:14:32.644 --> 00:14:34.025]  Well, these are just managers.
[00:14:34.025 --> 00:14:35.387]  Yeah, they're the chosen ones.
[00:14:35.387 --> 00:14:37.168]  They need to run our lives.
[00:14:37.168 --> 00:14:39.229]  Right, they're the operators.
[00:14:39.229 --> 00:14:41.131]  But right, they're not the owners.
[00:14:41.667 --> 00:14:45.829]  But what I should mention, reading these reports, like, they're repercussions for us.
[00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:50.691]  I mean, I don't care if these guys are running around trying to run our planet, if they did a good job of it.
[00:14:50.691 --> 00:14:59.314]  The problem is, for example, when the IMF and World Bank seized on the economy of Turkey, and I just got their Turkish internal report, that's secret.
[00:14:59.314 --> 00:15:02.115]  The problem is that they've destroyed the economy by
[00:15:03.249 --> 00:15:06.391]  Requiring the nation to raise interest rates to the roof.
[00:15:06.391 --> 00:15:10.455]  Imagine if you had credit card purchases that cost you 250%.
[00:15:10.455 --> 00:15:12.837]  Exactly what would you buy tomorrow?
[00:15:12.837 --> 00:15:14.599]  That destroys an economy.
[00:15:14.599 --> 00:15:24.227]  The economy starts going down, and today an Islamic party, this weekend an Islamic party was just elected to power in Turkey, and every single report says the same thing.
[00:15:24.227 --> 00:15:29.812]  The people there don't care about the Islamic fundamentalists, but they're so tired of being impoverished,
[00:15:30.356 --> 00:15:36.004]  By the current leaders going along with the World Bank plan, that they turn to the Islamic parties.
[00:15:36.004 --> 00:15:41.151]  Unfortunately, you turn to the Islamic parties, and that comes back to haunt the rest of the planet.
[00:15:41.854 --> 00:15:43.215]  So there are repercussions.
[00:15:43.215 --> 00:16:00.150]  Now let's understand because in two past reports and in your book and the interview that you did, that we did of course, posted a transcript on your site, it's gone worldwide as you said and published in many newspapers, Mr. Powlis, they admit though that they want to destabilize countries so they can't pay back the debt.
[00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:02.272]  I mean isn't that part of a four-part plan?
[00:16:02.272 --> 00:16:04.875]  Oh yeah, they want to.
[00:16:04.875 --> 00:16:05.355]  I mean they don't
[00:16:05.697 --> 00:16:08.279]  They wouldn't say to themselves, so we can become rich.
[00:16:08.279 --> 00:16:22.407]  What they say is, well, if there's a little instability, which is matched by what they call resolve, meaning troops in the street, then there'll be no visible dissent to our programs, to what they would call rationalize the economies, which is to turn them over.
[00:16:22.407 --> 00:16:32.333]  But like in the case of Argentina, the water systems were turned over to Enron Corporation and Vivendi Corporation, well, of France.
[00:16:32.333 --> 00:16:33.914]  It used to be called Léonidas de Zou.
[00:16:36.016 --> 00:16:50.560]  Enron took the Buenos Aires water system and the assets disappeared, all the workers were fired, the pipes started breaking, the water was contaminated, the bills went up, until there were of course people in the streets throwing rocks and burning cars.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.981]  So it has repercussions because it comes back to us.
[00:16:53.981 --> 00:17:01.903]  Then Enron implodes and the United States taxpayer is now on the hook for the cost in Argentina.
[00:17:01.903 --> 00:17:05.184]  You know that our government treasury is now going to have to
[00:17:05.828 --> 00:17:10.229]  A pay for the cost of repairing the Argentine system that Enron wrecked.
[00:17:10.229 --> 00:17:13.790]  And I don't know where, you know, they took off with millions, if not billions of dollars.
[00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:15.771]  Billion dollar Cayman Island offshore accounts.
[00:17:15.771 --> 00:17:21.153]  We know that they just imploded that as a dummy corporation, haven't transferred the actual wealth before the implosion.
[00:17:21.153 --> 00:17:30.395]  I mean, the problem is that we are backing up through our Export-Import Bank, through our Export Guarantee Corporation.
[00:17:30.395 --> 00:17:31.596]  It's U.S.
[00:17:31.596 --> 00:17:32.696]  taxpayer money.
[00:17:32.696 --> 00:17:34.477]  What are we going to hit on when we get back, Greg?
[00:17:34.477 --> 00:17:35.517]  What are some of the points real quick?
[00:17:36.109 --> 00:17:38.430]  Tuesday, stealing the election.
[00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:40.630]  And the Saudis, our buddies.
[00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:47.992]  Alright, stay right there, and we'll also take calls at 800-259-9231.
[00:17:47.992 --> 00:17:49.393]  We're on the march.
[00:17:49.393 --> 00:17:51.913]  The empire's on the run.
[00:17:51.913 --> 00:17:54.594]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:18:05.316 --> 00:18:06.177]  Welcome back, folks.
[00:18:06.177 --> 00:18:06.977]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:18:06.977 --> 00:18:13.002]  It's Real Radio crashing through the phony left-right paradigm, showing you who really runs the planet.
[00:18:13.002 --> 00:18:19.087]  We're talking to award-winning journalist from the BBC and author Greg Pallast here on the show with us.
[00:18:19.087 --> 00:18:21.909]  We're about to go to Eleanor, Richard, and others that are holding.
[00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:28.254]  Total free number to join us on-air, 1-800-259-9231 if you have any questions or comments for Greg Pallast.
[00:18:30.316 --> 00:18:30.577]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:18:30.577 --> 00:18:32.741]  Greg, one more quick question about the water.
[00:18:36.127 --> 00:18:44.331]  I remember seeing articles through the PR firms, the mainstream media, that there's no fresh water, you're going to have to pay hundreds of dollars now for what would cost dollars years ago.
[00:18:44.331 --> 00:18:58.637]  And then, I watched these international corporations that own the central banks, grabbing up all the water supplies worldwide, trying to make farmers put meters on their wells in very temperate areas with lots of water, with aquifers brimming.
[00:18:58.637 --> 00:19:00.178]  We see this consolidation.
[00:19:00.996 --> 00:19:02.316]  This really is fascism.
[00:19:02.316 --> 00:19:07.998]  They socialize the wealth and transfer it through a wealth pipeline, pun intended, for themselves.
[00:19:07.998 --> 00:19:10.499]  I mean, how does this whole water thing work?
[00:19:10.499 --> 00:19:13.100]  You know, the water pirates are just amazing.
[00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.980]  And by the way, here's a great one for you.
[00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:16.741]  You know who's one of their big buddies?
[00:19:16.741 --> 00:19:18.522]  It's Jeb Bush out of Florida.
[00:19:18.522 --> 00:19:25.104]  He was behind a scheme to turn over to a company named Azurex the fresh water that comes out of the Everglades.
[00:19:25.104 --> 00:19:29.325]  Which right now, anyone in any of the cities can take the fresh water from the Everglades.
[00:19:30.001 --> 00:19:32.962]  Without cost to consumers.
[00:19:32.962 --> 00:19:41.645]  At the moment, the water is being contaminated by sugar plantations, the Von Hul family.
[00:19:41.645 --> 00:19:45.407]  Big, big contributors to the Bush family and, by the way, to the Democratic Party.
[00:19:45.407 --> 00:19:48.268]  They are the biggest contributors to both parties in Florida.
[00:19:48.268 --> 00:19:50.749]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:19:50.749 --> 00:19:56.511]  Those guys who are destroying the water of the Everglades, rather than being told to clean up their act, which would cost them about $800 million,
[00:19:58.044 --> 00:20:04.729]  Instead, this company, Azurix, said, well, you give us the water, we'll clean it up as long as you let us resell it.
[00:20:04.729 --> 00:20:11.073]  Azurix was, until a couple months ago, 100% owned subsidiary of Enron.
[00:20:11.073 --> 00:20:13.895]  As if they owned water that was already there.
[00:20:13.895 --> 00:20:25.844]  Meanwhile, they're forcing the families and the neighborhoods out, saying they're going to flood their land, and using the phony environmental movement to clean them off the land so they can own it, when they're the ones actually hurting the environment.
[00:20:25.844 --> 00:20:26.945]  It's so classic.
[00:20:27.814 --> 00:20:35.160]  In fact, I'm deeply concerned because I saw this happen in Britain where the water was privatized and the water bills went up 250%.
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:40.024]  Enron took over a big company called Essex Water.
[00:20:40.024 --> 00:20:45.568]  It got to the point where you could get arrested in Britain for watering your lawn during certain weeks.
[00:20:45.568 --> 00:20:46.909]  Now, let's understand this.
[00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:48.771]  They call it privatization, but it's not.
[00:20:48.771 --> 00:20:54.195]  It's like Hitler saying, all right, Herman Goering, we're going to privatize this factory.
[00:20:54.195 --> 00:20:55.036]  You own it now.
[00:20:55.949 --> 00:20:57.130]  I mean, that's all they're doing.
[00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:58.631]  This is not free market.
[00:20:58.631 --> 00:21:04.656]  Well, you know, the guy that ordered the privatizations in Britain is a guy named Lord Wakeham.
[00:21:04.656 --> 00:21:06.898]  What a character.
[00:21:06.898 --> 00:21:11.721]  And he was on the audit committee of the board of directors of Enron.
[00:21:11.721 --> 00:21:21.649]  And yet, here's a guy who sold Enron the water systems, sold Enron the electric systems of Britain, and was supposedly in charge of monitoring their books on their board of directors.
[00:21:21.649 --> 00:21:22.850]  And again, he's the head of N.M.
[00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:23.370]  Rothschild.
[00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:31.938]  And also, Wakem, he's connected to most of the major international banks.
[00:21:31.938 --> 00:21:35.241]  Plus, he's actually a voting member of the House of Lords.
[00:21:37.383 --> 00:21:38.323]  He didn't miss a trick.
[00:21:38.323 --> 00:21:41.204]  So these are the guys who are, you know, making these wonderful decisions.
[00:21:41.204 --> 00:21:42.485]  Do I trust their decisions?
[00:21:42.485 --> 00:21:45.186]  Are they looking out for the interest of the average person?
[00:21:45.186 --> 00:21:46.726]  I have a few doubts about that.
[00:21:46.726 --> 00:21:50.407]  Well, my point is they really fund the phony mainstream environmental movement.
[00:21:50.407 --> 00:21:54.849]  They use it to grab people's land while they're the ones putting the MBT in the fuel.
[00:21:54.849 --> 00:21:57.770]  They're the ones dumping the toxic waste in the ocean.
[00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:00.150]  And then they're going, oh, we've got to save the environment.
[00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:01.811]  Take everybody's ranch property.
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:11.543]  Well, I'm very concerned that there are, you know, that there's a huge misdirection sometimes in the environmental movement, not looking to the corporate powers which are grabbing these properties.
[00:22:11.543 --> 00:22:24.547]  And we did have some problems with, I think some in green groups, who thought it would be brilliant to use what they call market mechanisms to save the environment, like raising the price of water to ranchers and to the farmers.
[00:22:24.547 --> 00:22:28.148]  That it just so happens that these international corporations are going to own that water.
[00:22:28.618 --> 00:22:35.764]  Yeah, and the problem is that you raise the price and all that does is allow the water and power pirates to come in and seize the property.
[00:22:35.764 --> 00:22:36.485]  There you go.
[00:22:36.485 --> 00:22:39.327]  Now, Greg Powless, I know you study this in depth.
[00:22:39.327 --> 00:22:43.991]  I'm seeing Democrats just caught here in Austin rigging the electronic voting machines.
[00:22:43.991 --> 00:22:45.192]  It was in our paper Thursday.
[00:22:45.192 --> 00:22:46.794]  I never even covered it.
[00:22:46.794 --> 00:22:51.298]  You've got lots of little Democratic scams going on down at the micro level.
[00:22:52.638 --> 00:23:01.121]  It's very interesting when I say that the Democrats have perfected retail vote stealing, and the Republicans are perfecting wholesale vote stealing.
[00:23:01.121 --> 00:23:04.502]  They've kind of divided the market in vote fraud.
[00:23:04.502 --> 00:23:07.863]  They have their own monopoly.
[00:23:07.863 --> 00:23:16.486]  But the interesting one, of course, that will be significant is in Florida, where a brother, Jeb, is running for his life for re-election.
[00:23:16.486 --> 00:23:20.187]  And I had uncovered before the presidential election for BBC television,
[00:23:20.951 --> 00:23:26.856]  In 2000, Jeb Bush and Katherine Harris had knocked off, I thought, 57,000.
[00:23:26.856 --> 00:23:38.585]  Now, by the way, Harris says it was 94,000 people off the voter rolls, most of them African, or about half of them African American, most of them Democrats.
[00:23:38.585 --> 00:23:45.390]  And now she has signed an agreement with the courts of Florida to return these people to the voter rolls.
[00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:47.372]  There's tens of thousands of voters.
[00:23:47.372 --> 00:23:47.892]  But guess what?
[00:23:48.524 --> 00:23:54.209]  They're not going to be able to do it by Tuesday's election, when Jeb Bush is on the ballot.
[00:23:54.209 --> 00:24:05.639]  So you're going to see tens of thousands of voters, mostly Democrats, about half of them African American, not permitted to vote in the Tuesday election, which is going to be a squeaker by absolutely everyone's analysis.
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.241]  Blake, you have the right point.
[00:24:08.241 --> 00:24:10.423]  There is no monopoly of any party on vote theft.
[00:24:10.423 --> 00:24:13.685]  It's just that in Florida, the Republicans have complete control of the statistical data.
[00:24:13.685 --> 00:24:19.309]  Yeah, I've noticed the Democrats just stop the ballot boxes, run the scams at the county level, even in Republican counties.
[00:24:19.309 --> 00:24:20.530]  I don't know how they get away with them.
[00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:22.391]  We've caught them several times here in Austin.
[00:24:22.391 --> 00:24:26.414]  But then at the national level, the Republicans do it from the very seats of power.
[00:24:26.414 --> 00:24:28.735]  Well, the Republicans are more sophisticated.
[00:24:28.735 --> 00:24:31.237]  I actually talked to Terry McAuliffe, the head of the Democratic Party.
[00:24:31.792 --> 00:24:38.756]  The Republicans have figured out how to use computers and are pushing towards computerizing all the voting systems of America.
[00:24:38.756 --> 00:24:44.460]  In fact, that came out in what is called, weirdly, the Martin Luther King Voting Reform Act of 2002.
[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:47.022]  I'm sure Dr. King is spinning in his grave.
[00:24:47.022 --> 00:24:51.264]  Chuckie Schumer is co-sponsoring that, which shows that some of the Democrats are going wild.
[00:24:51.264 --> 00:24:52.745]  I'm very nervous, because you know what it is?
[00:24:52.745 --> 00:24:56.388]  It's really an incumbent re-election insurance plan.
[00:24:56.388 --> 00:24:59.970]  The Democrats like it, the Republicans like it, who are in office because
[00:25:00.456 --> 00:25:04.158]  For example, the New York Democrats control the voting machinery in many areas.
[00:25:04.158 --> 00:25:07.780]  So they don't mind centralized computing where they can monkey with the votes.
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:10.602]  And the Republicans certainly like it in Florida where they control the machinery.
[00:25:10.602 --> 00:25:17.846]  So the incumbent politicians seem to have gotten together and shook hands on a system which will keep the incumbents incumbent.
[00:25:17.846 --> 00:25:24.049]  The problem is that once you centralize, once you have these massive central computerized voting systems,
[00:25:24.611 --> 00:25:28.032]  Including control of the registries.
[00:25:28.032 --> 00:25:29.793]  With zero checks and balances!
[00:25:29.793 --> 00:25:30.713]  Well, let's put it this way.
[00:25:30.713 --> 00:25:38.716]  Florida just used the, what's called, a company called ES&S, the new voting machines, the touchscreen voting.
[00:25:38.716 --> 00:25:44.338]  In some offices, you had 19,000 voters with 29,000 votes cast.
[00:25:44.338 --> 00:25:51.401]  I mean, you can have goof-ups and manipulation and games played with computers on a
[00:25:51.894 --> 00:25:55.317]  On a scale that you can't imagine with the old games of, you know, filling out fake applications.
[00:25:55.317 --> 00:26:17.675]  Well, as of Thursday's Austin American States, when there were eight signed affidavits, now there's over 500, I'm told, where at one voting center, at 1-H-E-B, here at Austin grocery store voting area, you go in, the Democrat election judges say, here, just press this, especially to Hispanics who can't speak English, they press and vote straight Democratic tickets.
[00:26:17.675 --> 00:26:21.518]  Now that's just local level, and that's confirmed, and nothing's going to be done about it.
[00:26:22.319 --> 00:26:28.362]  Well, because the incumbents in each party who have control of their own little areas, it's kind of like a wink and nod.
[00:26:28.362 --> 00:26:30.443]  We don't question what you're doing.
[00:26:30.443 --> 00:26:44.209]  You know, the most amazing thing about Florida is that while the NAACP has sued over the removal of these tens of thousands of black voters, innocent people, removed from the voter rolls, on the ground, by the way, they are felons who committed crimes.
[00:26:44.209 --> 00:26:50.392]  I had one guy, I actually have, out of, I was able to obtain the actual computer files from Katherine Harris's office.
[00:26:51.098 --> 00:26:52.399]  Actual computer files.
[00:26:52.399 --> 00:26:59.444]  You have people, there's one guy named Thomas Cooper that shows him convicted on January 30th, 2007.
[00:26:59.444 --> 00:27:04.067]  This is the type of junk that they use to knock people out.
[00:27:04.067 --> 00:27:05.768]  It's all garbage, right?
[00:27:05.768 --> 00:27:06.989]  And they admit it's garbage.
[00:27:06.989 --> 00:27:10.551]  The company that came up with the list said it was garbage.
[00:27:10.551 --> 00:27:14.334]  The company made an announcement that they will never do this again.
[00:27:14.334 --> 00:27:17.316]  You can't do this stuff honestly with computers.
[00:27:17.316 --> 00:27:20.258]  And don't forget that there's a connection between the computerization
[00:27:20.703 --> 00:27:20.983]  I think so.
[00:27:40.467 --> 00:27:41.547]  We're good to go.
[00:28:02.217 --> 00:28:06.943]  I don't feel safer from terrorists when the United States government has a DNA database on me.
[00:28:06.943 --> 00:28:19.317]  Wired Magazine reported that hundreds of grocery stores and dozens of chains have put presser sensors under the tiles on the floor, biometric face scanning cameras, and microphones.
[00:28:19.317 --> 00:28:21.580]  This is in hundreds of stores right now.
[00:28:22.313 --> 00:28:35.837]  And they're building digital algorithms, psychological outlays by your purchases, by how long you linger, by what you do, then they instantly upload your credit card purchases into an NSA data bank that's wired magazine.
[00:28:35.837 --> 00:28:38.358]  I mean, this is going past Big Brother.
[00:28:38.358 --> 00:28:46.520]  Well, you have to understand that the new anti-terrorism law has a provision which I found very... that concerned me greatly.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.281]  For the first time, the U.S.
[00:28:48.281 --> 00:28:51.342]  Justice Department will be entitled to access private
[00:28:51.963 --> 00:28:52.463]  We're good to go.
[00:29:14.068 --> 00:29:14.448]  The U.S.
[00:29:14.448 --> 00:29:19.451]  Justice Department has the right to kind of go leafing through computer files without a warrant.
[00:29:19.451 --> 00:29:28.917]  Well, the sneak-and-peek provision, section 213, says they can do it in your actual home business library and then order you, if you catch them there, to not tell anyone.
[00:29:28.917 --> 00:29:42.866]  I'm very concerned about this, especially with Choice Point and its DNA database, because I don't like the combination of the fact that this is the company that, through its database manipulation of the voter rolls in Florida, they, in effect, by computer,
[00:29:43.353 --> 00:29:47.736]  He chose our president, and now he's chosen them for the biggest contracts under the anti-terrorism.
[00:29:47.736 --> 00:29:55.280]  By the way, I have a report here out of Ohio where they're going door-to-door to collect blood samples and just asking people to do it.
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:30:00.583]  They're now taking blood from all babies in all the major states and medically putting it into this database.
[00:30:00.583 --> 00:30:01.744]  Were you aware of that?
[00:30:01.744 --> 00:30:03.284]  Yeah, well, you know what they're doing?
[00:30:03.284 --> 00:30:09.348]  They're saying, for example, Choice Point, this company that selected our president, and now they're making billions.
[00:30:09.912 --> 00:30:26.201]  They're doing things like, they got a big play on ABC television saying that they've been able to spring innocent men from jail with committed rape because they use their DNA, or excuse me, committing rape, because they use a DNA database to prove that they're innocent.
[00:30:26.201 --> 00:30:32.725]  They use a couple good, good, good things that they use with the database, or that they find a missing child through the DNA database.
[00:30:32.725 --> 00:30:34.766]  So everyone says, oh yeah, take my baby's blood.
[00:30:35.273 --> 00:30:44.581]  Well, you know, before you do that, there's nothing, unless they give you a contract that says this will only be used in case your child is missing or lost and you agree to release this information.
[00:30:44.581 --> 00:30:52.308]  Well, the Supreme Court has ruled that they can take that blood, get a protein out of it or a genetic system, and then patent it.
[00:30:52.308 --> 00:30:54.650]  Oh, yeah, we're... Also, they can frame you with it.
[00:30:54.650 --> 00:31:02.056]  Well, the problem is, I just think that, you know, the new expansion of using the cover of anti-terrorism
[00:31:02.868 --> 00:31:04.369]  Let's talk about that in a second.
[00:31:04.369 --> 00:31:07.350]  Let's take a few calls, or we'll never get to them.
[00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:08.751]  Eleanor, where are you calling from?
[00:31:08.751 --> 00:31:10.431]  Then we'll talk to Richard and others.
[00:31:10.431 --> 00:31:11.592]  Eleanor, you're on the air.
[00:31:11.592 --> 00:31:11.932]  Go ahead.
[00:31:27.416 --> 00:31:32.924]  Alex, I'm calling you from Hamilton, Ontario.
[00:31:32.924 --> 00:31:43.179]  I just wanted to say that you've got a lot of Canadians on the edges of our seats up here because last Monday you announced that you were being carried by a Toronto station.
[00:31:43.977 --> 00:31:44.677]  No, I did not.
[00:31:44.677 --> 00:31:47.838]  I said I was going to be on a Toronto station as a guest.
[00:31:47.838 --> 00:31:48.419]  Oh, okay.
[00:31:48.419 --> 00:31:51.860]  So you don't have any Canadian affiliates at the moment?
[00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:56.761]  No, you can just listen on the internet or shortwave, but I've been on about ten Canadian stations in the last month.
[00:31:56.761 --> 00:32:01.003]  I was on AM640 this weekend and last weekend.
[00:32:01.443 --> 00:32:02.984]  Yes, but not regularly.
[00:32:02.984 --> 00:32:04.444]  This is a problem.
[00:32:04.444 --> 00:32:07.526]  I've been trying to figure out a way to get you an affiliate here.
[00:32:07.526 --> 00:32:12.127]  I do some picketing on the street corner and I play your show to the people who pass by.
[00:32:12.127 --> 00:32:12.808]  Oh, wow!
[00:32:12.808 --> 00:32:13.968]  Thank you.
[00:32:13.968 --> 00:32:18.470]  Anyway, I don't have a specific question for Mr. Palast, and I thank you very much for your time.
[00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:19.170]  All right, Eleanor.
[00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:20.051]  Thank you for the call.
[00:32:20.051 --> 00:32:21.531]  Let's talk to Richard in Florida.
[00:32:21.531 --> 00:32:22.452]  Richard, you're on the air.
[00:32:22.452 --> 00:32:22.832]  Go ahead.
[00:32:24.366 --> 00:32:25.166]  Hello, Alex?
[00:32:25.166 --> 00:32:26.527]  Yes, Richard, go ahead.
[00:32:26.527 --> 00:32:28.408]  I have a question for Greg.
[00:32:28.408 --> 00:32:43.414]  Greg, I personally don't deny the existence, I believe in it, but to a skeptic, how can I prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that W1999 is a legitimate document?
[00:32:43.414 --> 00:32:49.817]  The book, I'm going to have it in the updated version of my book, an actual copy of these documents, which comes out February.
[00:32:51.004 --> 00:33:00.367]  But there is right now, there's a book called The Forbidden Truth, which was just put out in its English edition, which has added some of these documents.
[00:33:00.367 --> 00:33:03.468]  All W199 says is that it shows that the U.S.
[00:33:03.468 --> 00:33:16.632]  FBI had closed and then on September 13th of 2001, two days after attacking the World Trade Center, reopened an investigation of the Bin Laden family, indicating that the investigation had been previously
[00:33:17.361 --> 00:33:18.221]  Shut down.
[00:33:18.221 --> 00:33:20.122]  Look, I read the document here on air.
[00:33:20.122 --> 00:33:21.323]  The thing is online.
[00:33:21.323 --> 00:33:24.104]  It was in nine major newspapers.
[00:33:24.104 --> 00:33:26.525]  You can go to Infowars.com, print it off.
[00:33:26.525 --> 00:33:32.467]  You've got the government blocking investigations of Al-Qaeda, of the Bin Ladens, of Hamas.
[00:33:32.467 --> 00:33:34.288]  We've got FBI agent Robert Wright.
[00:33:34.288 --> 00:33:36.869]  We've got judicial watch head Larry Klayman.
[00:33:36.869 --> 00:33:44.932]  And David Shippers at the National Press Club giving an hour-long press conference on how they were blocked from stopping Al-Qaeda and hijackers at bases.
[00:33:44.932 --> 00:33:46.153]  That's been all over the news.
[00:33:47.694 --> 00:34:00.588]  There's a massive suit brought by the attorney, Richard Motley, but it's a multi-trillion dollar suit against the victims of September 11th.
[00:34:05.956 --> 00:34:06.877]  Yes, because the U.S.
[00:34:06.877 --> 00:34:09.778]  government is stepping in, not because there's not evidence, but the U.S.
[00:34:09.778 --> 00:34:12.518]  government is stepping in saying that the lawsuit is a threat to U.S.
[00:34:12.518 --> 00:34:13.459]  national security.
[00:34:13.459 --> 00:34:27.283]  Now, finding out who killed the people, like people on September 11th, or who backed al-Qaeda, who backed these terrorists, and gave them money, it strikes me that that's in the interest of our national security, as opposed to, because what this
[00:34:27.799 --> 00:34:39.029]  What the lawsuit was saying, and it used some material I had, and what I was very appreciative of, is that, by the way, French intelligence has now confirmed some of the things that I had been informed of.
[00:34:39.029 --> 00:34:49.518]  For example, in May of 1996, there was a meeting of the Al-Qaeda financial arm with Saudi Arabian billionaires to determine how much money
[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:58.264]  We'll go from Saudi Arabia to the billionaires, to Al Qaeda, and which billionaires will pay what?
[00:34:58.264 --> 00:35:00.886]  Well, on June 6, 2001, the L.A.
[00:35:00.886 --> 00:35:06.650]  Times reported Bush sent $135 million more to the Taliban and Al Qaeda.
[00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:12.254]  Right, and that was supposedly for their move to eradicate opium.
[00:35:12.254 --> 00:35:12.874]  Yeah, right.
[00:35:12.874 --> 00:35:14.295]  In Afghanistan.
[00:35:14.295 --> 00:35:19.519]  Of course, that doesn't mean they don't use the money for torturing their fellow citizens.
[00:35:20.049 --> 00:35:23.990]  But in the case, what I'm very concerned about is the Saudi funding of the Al-Qaeda network.
[00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:27.472]  Now, I had mentioned that on Alex's show last year.
[00:35:27.472 --> 00:35:33.334]  I had gotten that information from not the best of sources, not the most savory sources.
[00:35:33.334 --> 00:35:37.415]  I got that from international arms dealers who were involved in the meeting.
[00:35:37.415 --> 00:35:41.737]  Now, as it now turns out, the French intelligence has confirmed the meeting.
[00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:47.874]  And not only that, but I've discovered that French intelligence actually had a mole in the meeting and we now have the information from it.
[00:35:47.874 --> 00:35:49.476]  I want to hear about that, maybe when we get back.
[00:35:49.476 --> 00:35:50.917]  I hope that answers your question, Richard.
[00:35:50.917 --> 00:35:54.920]  Final segment with Greg Powell is coming up.
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.962]  Don't worry.
[00:35:56.962 --> 00:35:59.063]  This show is documented.
[00:35:59.063 --> 00:36:02.226]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:36:02.226 --> 00:36:05.828]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:36:05.828 --> 00:36:07.350]  Alright, Greg Powell's book.
[00:36:08.536 --> 00:36:26.020]  The best democracy money can buy has two pages of W1999 in it and he said that the new edition coming out here in the next few months in the United States will have more of the documents but I mean BBC, Times of London, French News, Indian News, it all reported it.
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:29.303]  Bush New, Bush Block FBI, you know, headlines like that.
[00:36:29.303 --> 00:36:35.650]  You can go read those stories on InfoWars.com in the Bush News section.
[00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:40.575]  So you can just simply go check that out or find out more at GregPalast.com.
[00:36:40.575 --> 00:36:42.717]  They posted more of those documents up there.
[00:36:42.717 --> 00:36:44.439]  Greg, I know I've been running over you a lot.
[00:36:44.439 --> 00:36:45.079]  You've said a lot.
[00:36:45.079 --> 00:36:48.102]  There's just so many points to hit here in the last few minutes.
[00:36:48.102 --> 00:36:49.624]  Any other key areas you want to hit on?
[00:36:50.262 --> 00:36:53.864]  Well, like I said, I'm concerned about this vote theft on Tuesday.
[00:36:53.864 --> 00:36:59.487]  I'm concerned that if we go into Iraq, look out for 48 hours later that they're going to assassinate the President of Venezuela.
[00:36:59.487 --> 00:37:01.968]  Talk about Saddam, but it's Venezuela that they want.
[00:37:01.968 --> 00:37:04.189]  And by the way, I want to tie in a couple of these things.
[00:37:04.189 --> 00:37:13.794]  They all tie up together, these stories, you know, which is that when, in the case of Venezuela, we are looking at a
[00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:20.672]  President who has dissented from the new globalization order.
[00:37:20.672 --> 00:37:24.113]  And that's why they call him a communist and a dictator, etc.
[00:37:24.113 --> 00:37:28.775]  As one of his ministers said, we are the people who have dissented from the IMF and the World Bank.
[00:37:28.775 --> 00:37:31.116]  They cannot let this man survive.
[00:37:31.116 --> 00:37:33.356]  Well, so is Malaysia, too.
[00:37:33.356 --> 00:37:34.057]  Well, yeah.
[00:37:34.057 --> 00:37:38.858]  Malaysia and other countries have said, forget it, but they have been...
[00:37:40.908 --> 00:37:43.989]  Uh, they've gotten away because they have other financial resources as well.
[00:37:43.989 --> 00:37:46.950]  And they have a couple trillion dollars of sweet crude they're sitting on.
[00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:52.132]  Yeah, and so, you know, if you're sitting on the oil, you're sitting on a powder keg, and so that's the danger.
[00:37:52.132 --> 00:37:54.973]  I would look out, always look for the news that they're not telling you about.
[00:37:54.973 --> 00:37:58.754]  If they're telling you about Iraq, you better look at the other side of the globe and see what the real agenda is.
[00:37:58.754 --> 00:37:59.214]  I agree.
[00:37:59.214 --> 00:38:07.357]  So Iraq's being used as a massive smokescreen for the economy imploding, the IMF and World Bank moving, assassinations, coup d'etats, and police state here domestically.
[00:38:07.357 --> 00:38:10.378]  That's the weapon of, Iraq is the weapon of mass distraction.
[00:38:11.225 --> 00:38:13.746]  They just want to take your eye off the ball.
[00:38:13.746 --> 00:38:18.988]  Now, they're saying Iraq's going to attack us for sure when we attack them.
[00:38:18.988 --> 00:38:21.249]  I'd say that's going to be a CIA op.
[00:38:21.249 --> 00:38:30.093]  Well, what I'm very concerned about is, again, my concern is the lack of investigation of our so-called buddies, the Saudis.
[00:38:30.093 --> 00:38:36.476]  By the way, my new book will be discussing the fact that the Saudis backed the creation of the Islamic bomb.
[00:38:37.131 --> 00:38:47.437]  And when I asked the CIA agents and the FBI agents exactly what investigations were killed by Bush before September 11th, don't just tell me that investigations were killed.
[00:38:47.437 --> 00:38:48.598]  Give me an example.
[00:38:48.598 --> 00:38:53.080]  And specifically it was something, one of the investigations was of Khan Industries.
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:59.584]  Khan Industries is the kind of private company which actually put together the atomic bomb for Pakistan.
[00:39:00.054 --> 00:39:07.391]  Now, we've got a nutcase dictator, Islamic fundamentalist dictator in Pakistan who's become George Bush's best friend, but this guy's actually...
[00:39:07.921 --> 00:39:09.322]  Threaten these atomic bombs.
[00:39:09.322 --> 00:39:13.645]  And then the head of the intelligence committee wires $100,000 to Mohammed Adda.
[00:39:13.645 --> 00:39:18.389]  He's meeting with Porter Goss and Graham the morning of September 11th, eating breakfast.
[00:39:18.389 --> 00:39:20.310]  This whole thing rigged to the takeover.
[00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:21.391]  30 seconds left.
[00:39:21.391 --> 00:39:22.652]  What about this French meeting?
[00:39:22.652 --> 00:39:26.695]  What did they say with their mole inside this meeting with the globalists?
[00:39:26.695 --> 00:39:31.758]  The French intelligence has confirmed that the Saudis had agreed to give money to al-Qaeda.
[00:39:32.779 --> 00:39:37.100]  And by the way, the terrible thing is because apparently they were slow in paying off Al Qaeda.
[00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:39.921]  That's why our Marines were killed at the Khobar Towers.
[00:39:39.921 --> 00:39:45.403]  It was a little delinquency payment, you know, a delinquent payment notice to the Saudis.
[00:39:45.403 --> 00:39:48.043]  Alright, Greg Pallas, keep up the great work.
[00:39:48.043 --> 00:39:48.884]  GregPallas.com.
[00:39:48.884 --> 00:39:50.424]  Hope to get you back on soon.
[00:39:50.424 --> 00:39:52.105]  Great work.
[00:39:52.105 --> 00:39:52.945]  Alright, thank you, sir.
[00:39:54.525 --> 00:39:55.966]  Thanks a lot.
[00:39:55.966 --> 00:40:00.429]  Alright folks, I'm out of time for this hour.
[00:40:00.429 --> 00:40:02.230]  I appreciate you guys tuning in.
