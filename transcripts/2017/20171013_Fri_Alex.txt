[00:00:11.462 --> 00:00:22.369]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:00:26.572 --> 00:00:29.234]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.285]  With our help, President Trump is exercising the globalist demon out of our republic.
[00:00:41.407 --> 00:00:45.170]  And as you look at the news every day that emerges, you see the theme.
[00:00:46.131 --> 00:00:53.617]  Not the theme the globalists are pushing, but the theme that the citizens are realizing collectively together.
[00:00:54.378 --> 00:00:55.599]  Citizens of planet Earth.
[00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.921]  Just look at Drudge Report.
[00:00:57.981 --> 00:00:59.021]  Look at these headlines.
[00:00:59.702 --> 00:01:02.563]  Consumer sentiment hits 13-year high.
[00:01:03.084 --> 00:01:04.825]  Stocks set new records.
[00:01:06.345 --> 00:01:19.313]  And then, right below it, McCain to thwart tax cuts that would bring more money into the Treasury and help pay down the national debt.
[00:01:19.393 --> 00:01:20.954]  You cut taxes, more money comes in.
[00:01:21.274 --> 00:01:23.095]  You just got to keep spending the same.
[00:01:23.175 --> 00:01:25.677]  And Trump's been cutting spending in many areas.
[00:01:26.567 --> 00:01:28.828]  But Congress has been thwarting him there as well.
[00:01:29.248 --> 00:01:43.936]  But he then used the nuclear option that Dr. Corsi's been hammering here for months to just defund it, don't let him raid Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to fund Obamacare and it's... You know what up.
[00:01:45.037 --> 00:01:46.418]  It's dead in the sun.
[00:01:47.658 --> 00:01:52.001]  Meanwhile, Bannon revelation, quote, helps Dems.
[00:01:54.394 --> 00:01:56.175]  Burn Republican Party to the ground.
[00:01:56.275 --> 00:02:03.418]  The media is spinning it that, oh, look, the Dems like Bannon because he's going to help burn down the Republican Party.
[00:02:03.498 --> 00:02:05.919]  No, he's helping make it the Populist Party.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.320]  We're making it the Populist Party.
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.721]  It's an information war.
[00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:13.183]  We're removing the neocon rhino globalist traitors.
[00:02:13.703 --> 00:02:18.846]  So the Democrats are acting like, oh, yeah, look, the Republicans are weak.
[00:02:18.886 --> 00:02:19.866]  Look what Bannon says.
[00:02:19.926 --> 00:02:20.847]  Yes, let's help him.
[00:02:21.287 --> 00:02:23.508]  They spin everything to act like
[00:02:24.724 --> 00:02:27.025]  Their party isn't burning down to the ground itself.
[00:02:28.245 --> 00:02:37.247]  The Republican Party is in a civil war and is trying to rejuvenate itself and it's a beautiful thing.
[00:02:37.347 --> 00:02:38.787]  And Bannon is 100% on target.
[00:02:40.208 --> 00:02:44.549]  Remember he said a few days ago, Trump only has a 30% chance of completing full term.
[00:02:46.042 --> 00:02:47.222]  Because of the 25th Amendment.
[00:02:47.382 --> 00:02:51.964]  The Democrats and the Republican leadership are on the hill shopping the idea.
[00:02:52.444 --> 00:03:00.186]  You've got to admit they're doing it to supercharge the base so they're aware of what's going on so we stop it.
[00:03:00.266 --> 00:03:01.667]  It's not fatalistic.
[00:03:01.747 --> 00:03:02.607]  It's not negative.
[00:03:02.667 --> 00:03:04.608]  It's not abandoned ship news.
[00:03:05.028 --> 00:03:06.368]  It's man the parapets!
[00:03:06.668 --> 00:03:07.969]  Pull up the drawbridge!
[00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.309]  Call out the guard!
[00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.330]  Awaken the king!
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.142]  On this Friday the 13th global transmission.
[00:03:19.804 --> 00:03:20.904]  So that's what we're talking about here.
[00:03:20.924 --> 00:03:22.325]  That's exactly what you do.
[00:03:23.166 --> 00:03:24.527]  The media always used to spin it.
[00:03:24.807 --> 00:03:29.351]  Jones is fear-mongering about global government and all these unstoppable elites.
[00:03:29.451 --> 00:03:30.591]  I wasn't saying they were unstoppable.
[00:03:30.812 --> 00:03:34.915]  I was saying they were weak because they were authoritarian and were operating by stealth.
[00:03:34.955 --> 00:03:37.757]  And as soon as you took the stealth away, they were wide open.
[00:03:38.712 --> 00:03:54.075]  And that's why all the King's Horses and all the King's Men and all the fake Hollywood people and all the M&Ms and all the little media twerps that have been propped up, they may be able to get some 12 and 13 year old snot-nosed folks to actually watch them.
[00:03:54.975 --> 00:03:57.475]  Or a few old people that still think it's trendy.
[00:03:57.835 --> 00:04:00.316]  Hey, Daddy-O, Macky Gnomey.
[00:04:00.696 --> 00:04:02.156]  Wow, you saw that M&M?
[00:04:02.476 --> 00:04:03.996]  He really took Trump to the woodshed.
[00:04:04.297 --> 00:04:05.557]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:05.577 --> 00:04:06.577]  That's why his approval rating's up.
[00:04:14.093 --> 00:04:18.035]  What they're doing is attempting to dynamite the resurgence of America.
[00:04:18.055 --> 00:04:29.280]  They're doing an economic operation to bankrupt this country and bring us into the world corporate government, just like a third world country is bankrupted and brought into the IMF or World Bank's orbit.
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.902]  But the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[00:04:35.763 --> 00:04:36.923]  And they're going astray now.
[00:04:38.304 --> 00:04:38.664]  Also,
[00:04:39.913 --> 00:04:45.355]  Mark Dice has touched on something really important, and that's the gay mafia in Hollywood.
[00:04:45.375 --> 00:04:48.036]  And that's going to be the next big shoe to drop.
[00:04:48.516 --> 00:04:54.198]  And then when that basement falls in, you'll find the entire labyrinth of pedophile networks.
[00:04:54.799 --> 00:04:58.100]  And then below that, Satan worshippers and human sacrifice cults.
[00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.760]  It's all about to come out.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.621]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.641 --> 00:05:01.241]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:05.197 --> 00:05:08.599]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:16.104]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:05:16.705 --> 00:05:25.110]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.493]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:05:29.733 --> 00:05:35.077]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:05:35.317 --> 00:05:39.159]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.741]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[00:05:42.981 --> 00:05:54.068]  AnthroPlex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[00:05:54.128 --> 00:05:56.809]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:03.013]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.783]  For 50 years, we've told them what to eat, what to drink, what to wear.
[00:06:11.803 --> 00:06:14.304]  For Christ's sake, Ben, don't you understand?
[00:06:14.764 --> 00:06:16.645]  Americans love television.
[00:06:17.025 --> 00:06:18.666]  They wean their kids on it.
[00:06:19.207 --> 00:06:20.807]  Listen, they love game shows.
[00:06:20.847 --> 00:06:21.888]  They love wrestling.
[00:06:22.248 --> 00:06:24.169]  They love sports and violence.
[00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.030]  So what do we do?
[00:06:27.411 --> 00:06:28.912]  We give them what they want!
[00:06:30.607 --> 00:06:31.827]  We're number one, Ben!
[00:06:32.367 --> 00:06:33.308]  That's all that counts!
[00:06:33.908 --> 00:06:36.548]  Believe me, I've been in the business 30 years!
[00:06:37.028 --> 00:06:39.729]  Well, I haven't been in show business as long as you have, Killian.
[00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:41.710]  But I'm a quick learner.
[00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.430]  So I'm going to give the audience what I think they want.
[00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:52.612]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the Resistance.
[00:06:56.823 --> 00:06:58.423]  You know what the American people want?
[00:06:58.463 --> 00:06:59.223]  They want dignity.
[00:06:59.244 --> 00:06:59.904]  They want freedom.
[00:07:00.404 --> 00:07:25.869]  They don't want to live in a rigged crony capitalist system with a bunch of psychopath jerks like Bezos, Zuckerberg, Al Gore, all these people breathing down our necks, exempting themselves from all the laws and rules and taxes, and then having the will and the nerve to then try to ruin our families and dominate and destroy our
[00:07:27.771 --> 00:07:39.977]  Civilization, just so you can politically mount our head on the wall and feel culturally superior because you're such bloated, evil, demonic, twisted sacks of garbage.
[00:07:41.818 --> 00:07:45.240]  We must escape from this matrix we're building.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.662]  Make no mistake, we are building the matrix right now.
[00:07:52.563 --> 00:07:54.985]  It's 100% admitted by the social engineers,
[00:07:55.865 --> 00:08:01.888]  By the technocrats, it's their plan, and they've announced that humanity, in general, is obsolete.
[00:08:02.789 --> 00:08:03.509]  Obsolescent.
[00:08:09.272 --> 00:08:11.333]  It's a total revolution against humanity.
[00:08:14.695 --> 00:08:21.599]  And you've got traditionalists in the power structure that now really realize how horrible this plan is, and they're
[00:08:22.828 --> 00:08:24.189]  Stepping back from the edge of the cliff.
[00:08:24.509 --> 00:08:25.350]  That's what Trump is.
[00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:26.931]  You don't think he's a cream puff, do you?
[00:08:27.392 --> 00:08:28.753]  Guy that owns casinos and stuff?
[00:08:30.034 --> 00:08:30.194]  No.
[00:08:31.174 --> 00:08:36.819]  They're just stepping back from the edge of the cliff and going, you know, this is really evil and stupid.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:51.090]  So when you get down to the final phases of this, we're gonna find out who really wants to be a disgraceful sack of garbage like Harvey Weinstein or Jeffrey Dahmer.
[00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:54.352]  Or any of these people, any of these psychopaths.
[00:08:54.992 --> 00:08:57.414]  And who really wants to build something?
[00:08:58.495 --> 00:08:59.896]  And wants to really do something?
[00:09:03.119 --> 00:09:05.821]  A bunch of snaky backstabbing scum.
[00:09:07.382 --> 00:09:17.871]  Building the most confusing, wicked, twisted, diseased, drugged out world they could possibly build because people like Harvey Weinstein are miserable.
[00:09:22.702 --> 00:09:46.541]  And make no mistake, make no mistake, the NFL, mainstream media, the whole Hollywood, globalist, garbage combine is in its total and complete death throes right now.
[00:09:48.923 --> 00:09:50.505]  And so the power it had
[00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:58.373]  As it dissipates, all of the skeletons are about to come out of the closet.
[00:09:58.873 --> 00:09:59.893]  And the globalists know this.
[00:09:59.913 --> 00:10:11.419]  That's why they're desperately wanting authoritarianism to shut down their competition and to stave off reprisals, vendettas.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.762]  They're fighting for their very lives right now.
[00:10:17.662 --> 00:10:18.403]  And as I've said,
[00:10:22.551 --> 00:10:29.296]  But I've talked to people that have been Bilderberg attendees and high-level Davos attendees and all the rest of it off-record.
[00:10:30.557 --> 00:10:32.918]  I've told them, turn against globalism now.
[00:10:33.118 --> 00:10:34.659]  Turn against the Satan worship now.
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.421]  Turn against the corruption now.
[00:10:37.782 --> 00:10:41.384]  Burn down, help us burn down the New World Order and you might get your soul back.
[00:10:45.527 --> 00:10:49.290]  But fire is the answer
[00:10:51.465 --> 00:10:53.045]  To cleanse us of this disease!
[00:10:54.826 --> 00:10:57.366]  A lyrical fire in the minds of men.
[00:11:01.027 --> 00:11:04.188]  You know, I saw this video a few days ago.
[00:11:04.208 --> 00:11:16.410]  I saw a news report on it, and then this morning I saw Mark Dice's report, and I've got all this Iran speech news coming up, and I've got all this cover-up of Las Vegas as beyond imploded.
[00:11:18.902 --> 00:11:38.746]  But really one of the first things I wanted to get to today is a report up on newswars.com and infowars.com by Mark Dice dealing with Terry Crews, he plays the president in one of my favorite movies, Idiocracy, admits Hollywood's dark secret.
[00:11:41.747 --> 00:11:46.908]  And ladies and gentlemen, it's that the going after the women is only secondary and only to humiliate them.
[00:11:49.013 --> 00:11:53.817]  It's really about men dominating other men, and it's not even for the gay sex.
[00:11:55.818 --> 00:11:57.479]  It is an act of domination.
[00:11:57.559 --> 00:12:12.911]  And when he said that, I noticed he got all those headlines, I thought, you know, I've had Hollywood producers grab me by the genitals twice, and I've had them pat me on the butt many other times, and that's why, one reason I don't go out there.
[00:12:14.721 --> 00:12:16.342]  And I'm not saying that to get a bunch of attention.
[00:12:16.602 --> 00:12:18.103]  It's the kind of thing guys don't admit.
[00:12:18.603 --> 00:12:20.224]  But for me, I was like, what the hell?
[00:12:20.324 --> 00:12:21.245]  And just sloughed it off.
[00:12:21.305 --> 00:12:22.725]  And then they're like, hehehehehe.
[00:12:23.066 --> 00:12:24.666]  And like, you know, hobble over to the corner.
[00:12:24.686 --> 00:12:27.608]  But you're walking into a meeting with high-level Hollywood producers.
[00:12:28.048 --> 00:12:28.669]  I mean, big ones.
[00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:32.090]  Big ones.
[00:12:33.933 --> 00:12:35.774]  They're gonna grab your genitals, a lot of times.
[00:12:36.614 --> 00:12:39.375]  And it's just a total act of domination.
[00:12:39.896 --> 00:12:59.384]  And it's always old, fat men with a gray-green skin, with cigarettes, and they're sitting around, and they're talking about this and that, and then, you're walking out to the parking lot, or the house or wherever, and you say, hey, have a great day, be safe, that's a Texas thing,
[00:13:00.106 --> 00:13:01.046]  Are you threatening me?
[00:13:01.066 --> 00:13:02.727]  Oh, I believe you're just threatening me.
[00:13:02.747 --> 00:13:05.068]  I mean, they're so paranoid, so whacked out.
[00:13:05.988 --> 00:13:07.549]  But it's that act of domination.
[00:13:09.009 --> 00:13:11.010]  The two times, I guess it's just something they do.
[00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:13.891]  I mean, they really will grab you.
[00:13:14.672 --> 00:13:18.013]  And really, not try to hurt you, but squeeze you.
[00:13:19.353 --> 00:13:20.954]  I guess just to see what you're gonna do.
[00:13:23.064 --> 00:13:30.467]  And, you know, I'm the type of good-natured person that if I'm sitting there around people and around a group of people, I mean, I'm like, hey, watch it, what the hell, hey, what's your problem?
[00:13:30.867 --> 00:13:33.848]  Because, you know, as a guy, you want to act tough about it.
[00:13:35.489 --> 00:13:37.409]  But that's what goes on in Hollywood, folks.
[00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:42.371]  I'm not up here, like, crying about it on television, saying, I'm a rape victim, someone grab my genital splice.
[00:13:43.452 --> 00:13:49.394]  Or, you know, it's stuff like, hey, you want to watch Brokeback Mountain?
[00:13:51.375 --> 00:13:51.995]  Stuff like that.
[00:13:53.168 --> 00:13:56.730]  Now, people would think Charlie Sheen, who I've known for like 13 years, would be the guy doing that.
[00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:58.251]  None of those are Charlie Sheen stories.
[00:13:58.571 --> 00:14:03.013]  That was just one guy who would come on the air and it was interesting, so we had him on.
[00:14:04.774 --> 00:14:07.236]  And of course, he went off the deep end into partying and the rest of it.
[00:14:07.336 --> 00:14:16.561]  It's a sad story, but... Almost every Hollywood event I went to, they would either say,
[00:14:17.605 --> 00:14:20.531]  Well, you probably shouldn't be here because you're not into being a child molester, are you?
[00:14:21.373 --> 00:14:22.555]  Or, hey, do you love Satan?
[00:14:22.575 --> 00:14:25.220]  Because we worship the devil and we're going to pray to the devil at dinner tonight.
[00:14:25.982 --> 00:14:27.785]  The only place I never ran into that...
[00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:33.403]  Was like at Martin Sheen's house with his wife, who's super smart and super nice.
[00:14:35.064 --> 00:14:37.025]  I guess they're like Catholic slash kind of Buddhist.
[00:14:37.385 --> 00:14:38.506]  I know they do yoga and stuff.
[00:14:38.566 --> 00:14:39.326]  It was none of that.
[00:14:40.067 --> 00:14:42.228]  That's why you see him doing such dumb liberal stunts.
[00:14:42.768 --> 00:14:44.129]  And then you ask, how are they so awake?
[00:14:44.149 --> 00:14:45.229]  They know about vaccines.
[00:14:45.969 --> 00:14:47.110]  They got guns, folks.
[00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:50.472]  You know, it's just crazy.
[00:14:51.812 --> 00:14:52.553]  Now there's the Daily Beast.
[00:14:52.593 --> 00:14:53.933]  Hollywood goes full devil worship.
[00:14:54.014 --> 00:14:58.516]  I mean, they were some of the only people I ran into that were not devil worshipers.
[00:15:00.396 --> 00:15:01.837]  And by the way, did not like him.
[00:15:05.499 --> 00:15:08.700]  Yeah, I guess they've given Lucifer a star on the Hollywood Walk of Shame.
[00:15:09.581 --> 00:15:11.882]  I mean, it's just such a dead feeling when you're out there.
[00:15:11.922 --> 00:15:12.682]  It's so evil.
[00:15:13.243 --> 00:15:14.043]  It's so corrupt.
[00:15:14.183 --> 00:15:16.685]  And, you know, here I've told the stories here.
[00:15:18.686 --> 00:15:20.166]  You know, and I was just thinking about it.
[00:15:21.167 --> 00:15:22.007]  I had suppressed it.
[00:15:22.047 --> 00:15:22.668]  I had repressed it.
[00:15:23.448 --> 00:15:27.150]  One other Hollywood producer, three of them grabbed my genitals.
[00:15:28.371 --> 00:15:28.491]  And
[00:15:29.611 --> 00:15:33.455]  You know, if I said one of the people's names, folks would say, hey, that's, that's a patron.
[00:15:34.816 --> 00:15:35.897]  You know, there's another thing, too.
[00:15:35.937 --> 00:15:43.605]  When somebody you think of as being a good person, one of the few good people in Hollywood, and they grab you by the crotch, it's more of like a male dominance thing.
[00:15:44.365 --> 00:15:45.827]  But then imagine what it's like for women.
[00:15:46.728 --> 00:15:48.850]  And then who knows what's going on after that.
[00:15:49.671 --> 00:15:51.672]  But yeah, uh, wow, I have really...
[00:15:53.158 --> 00:15:54.681]  I mean, it's just a mess, man.
[00:15:54.781 --> 00:15:55.903]  It is a mess.
[00:15:56.024 --> 00:15:57.045]  And it's all coming down.
[00:15:57.446 --> 00:15:57.987]  It's dying.
[00:15:58.027 --> 00:15:59.189]  It really is dying right now.
[00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:01.293]  I'm trying to lean on the communist Chinese, but it's not working.
[00:16:02.976 --> 00:16:04.519]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we're running.
[00:16:05.788 --> 00:16:11.112]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[00:16:11.372 --> 00:16:12.493]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[00:16:12.753 --> 00:16:15.055]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[00:16:15.735 --> 00:16:22.240]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.782]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[00:16:26.102 --> 00:16:27.904]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[00:16:28.544 --> 00:16:36.954]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[00:16:36.994 --> 00:16:37.935]  They know how great it is.
[00:16:38.877 --> 00:16:42.621]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[00:16:43.562 --> 00:16:44.963]  Tropic means for the brain.
[00:16:45.763 --> 00:16:53.606]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[00:16:54.066 --> 00:16:59.709]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[00:17:05.091 --> 00:17:05.511]  That comes to $50.03.
[00:17:05.631 --> 00:17:09.693]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[00:17:10.093 --> 00:17:13.254]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[00:17:13.294 --> 00:17:14.234]  It's a good deal at $39.
[00:17:15.415 --> 00:17:16.135]  It's $19.96 at Infowarslife.com.

[00:18:27.359 --> 00:18:36.204]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our caveman ultimate paleo bone broth, turmeric, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, and more.
[00:18:36.764 --> 00:18:37.405]  Concentrate.
[00:18:37.425 --> 00:18:39.207]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[00:18:39.467 --> 00:18:40.829]  Next level compared to whey.
[00:18:40.849 --> 00:18:42.751]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[00:18:43.152 --> 00:18:44.033]  It's incredible.
[00:18:44.514 --> 00:18:46.416]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[00:18:46.596 --> 00:18:48.558]  It's bigger than I am already at 15.
[00:18:48.639 --> 00:18:49.119]  Incredible.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.321]  It is amazing.
[00:18:50.681 --> 00:18:51.963]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:18:52.403 --> 00:18:55.066]  50% off Caveman, but only a few days left.
[00:18:55.307 --> 00:18:56.068]  It's about to end.
[00:18:56.648 --> 00:18:58.969]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[00:18:59.429 --> 00:19:04.592]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[00:19:05.012 --> 00:19:06.393]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[00:19:06.653 --> 00:19:07.814]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[00:19:08.194 --> 00:19:09.014]  I want to thank you.
[00:19:09.334 --> 00:19:10.395]  We're all in this together.

[00:19:56.315 --> 00:20:01.137]  That's 50% off Rainforest Plus, 50% off Caveman, but only for one week.
[00:20:06.139 --> 00:20:08.780]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:20.023 --> 00:20:22.065]  The Matrix is everywhere.
[00:20:22.105 --> 00:20:22.966]  It is all around us.
[00:20:23.627 --> 00:20:25.289]  Even now, in this very room.
[00:20:25.889 --> 00:20:30.013]  You can see it when you look out your window, or when you turn on your television.
[00:20:30.214 --> 00:20:35.559]  You can feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your tax.
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:40.364]  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
[00:20:41.545 --> 00:20:43.026]  That you are a slave.
[00:20:43.627 --> 00:20:46.268]  Like everyone else, you were born into bondage.
[00:20:46.309 --> 00:20:50.111]  Born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch.
[00:20:50.612 --> 00:20:56.156]  A prison for your mind.
[00:20:56.876 --> 00:20:58.577]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:59.018 --> 00:21:03.001]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:21:04.782 --> 00:21:05.643]  We are back live.
[00:21:06.683 --> 00:21:10.166]  So, I've been on a lot of TV shows and been in some movies.
[00:21:12.554 --> 00:21:13.915]  Reality television, you name it.
[00:21:14.475 --> 00:21:17.696]  Discovery Channel, History Channel, TruTV, you name it.
[00:21:18.956 --> 00:21:21.578]  And I've been on the late-night comedy shows years ago.
[00:21:21.598 --> 00:21:23.938]  Some of the late-night comedy shows.
[00:21:25.679 --> 00:21:35.463]  And... Because back then I was criticizing Bush a lot, and Hollywood was so one-dimensional, they thought, oh, that must mean you're a liberal.
[00:21:37.704 --> 00:21:39.805]  Until they find out your real political views.
[00:21:39.865 --> 00:21:40.705]  It's just crazy.
[00:21:46.553 --> 00:21:48.854]  And then still they like you because you're criticizing Bush.
[00:21:48.874 --> 00:21:52.235]  They don't get you don't like Bush, and you don't like the Democrats either.
[00:21:52.275 --> 00:21:53.816]  They just, it's so one-dimensional.
[00:21:56.277 --> 00:22:00.018]  But that was 20 years ago, 15 years ago, 10 years ago.
[00:22:00.038 --> 00:22:05.220]  I mean, I've barely gone out there in the last six, seven years ever.
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.621]  I wanted to be on Joe Rogan's podcast, and I was in and out day and a half.
[00:22:10.302 --> 00:22:15.304]  Love Northern California, love central areas, love the coast, but just Los Angeles is
[00:22:16.707 --> 00:22:18.729]  If Satan lives on the planet, that's where he lives.
[00:22:19.489 --> 00:22:25.654]  It's just an emptiness, a hellishness, the energy.
[00:22:26.975 --> 00:22:37.783]  And so people say, oh, you're so brave to talk about going into meetings with Hollywood producers, people that all want to put your film out or make a film with you.
[00:22:37.843 --> 00:22:39.004]  These are big, big names.
[00:22:42.717 --> 00:22:47.759]  Not as big as Weinstein, because he's just ubiquitous, that name, but grossing-wise, as big.
[00:22:48.659 --> 00:22:50.960]  You know, the lawyers for some of the top people.
[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.181]  The people that actually run it.
[00:22:52.481 --> 00:22:53.821]  The owners of the companies.
[00:22:54.662 --> 00:22:58.403]  Not the little actors and people running around under the mafia, all totally scared.
[00:23:01.144 --> 00:23:03.565]  And Hollywood checks out everything that's up and coming.
[00:23:05.626 --> 00:23:08.007]  It sees popularity before other people see it.
[00:23:08.991 --> 00:23:09.972]  That's, it's real talent.
[00:23:10.673 --> 00:23:12.134]  So they basically steal ideas.
[00:23:12.815 --> 00:23:14.337]  And so they would have a lot of meetings with me.
[00:23:15.498 --> 00:23:17.680]  And you know, pat on the butt, okay I played football.
[00:23:19.322 --> 00:23:22.044]  But no, grab you by the genitals.
[00:23:23.486 --> 00:23:27.870]  And I never took it as if it was done in a homosexual way.
[00:23:29.392 --> 00:23:31.114]  It was done as domination.
[00:23:32.793 --> 00:23:35.015]  And I'd be like, whoa, whoa, what the hell's going on?
[00:23:36.877 --> 00:23:41.582]  Just like you heard Weinstein, oh baby, I'm sorry, oh, come on, hey, hey, come on, whoa!
[00:23:41.882 --> 00:23:47.127]  And then later, completely scared of you, if you just said, you know, knock you upside the head.
[00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:56.176]  I mean, I would be in these meetings with these guys and not grovel and just say what I wanted, and they would be completely scared of me by the end of the meeting.
[00:23:57.072 --> 00:23:58.313]  These people are weird, folks.
[00:23:58.993 --> 00:24:00.394]  I'm telling you, Hollywood's weird.
[00:24:00.735 --> 00:24:01.855]  And I'm like, this is what it is?
[00:24:01.915 --> 00:24:03.296]  The top of the pyramid is this?
[00:24:05.078 --> 00:24:06.659]  And they all smoke cigarettes.
[00:24:07.379 --> 00:24:08.480]  Old, hairy men.
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:22.269]  And if you go to one of the parties, there's like this, you know, 85-year-old guy, total gangster, with this 22-year-old vampire woman, you know, just like Weinstein's wife, and it's just like, get me out of here, man.
[00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:24.231]  You'll be sitting there with a
[00:24:25.555 --> 00:24:33.258]  Butler bringing you hors d'oeuvres and a cocktail and there's ashes raining down on you at the pool.
[00:24:33.839 --> 00:24:40.001]  And like the third time that happened in a two-year period where I was at different pools at people's houses and ashes was raining down?
[00:24:40.021 --> 00:24:44.443]  Because there's just fires all the time and it gets caught in the air and flies around.
[00:24:45.004 --> 00:24:47.345]  You said to yourself, oh my gosh, something big's going on here.
[00:24:47.645 --> 00:24:47.965]  So listen.
[00:24:49.485 --> 00:24:57.290]  The whole house of cards is coming down, and it's going to collapse from the harassing and raping women, into harassing and raping men, into children, into Satanism.
[00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:59.692]  And it's all there, they tell you what they think.
[00:25:01.093 --> 00:25:07.957]  So here is the report by Mark Dice, breaking down TV star, movie star, I like the guy, I'm a fan.
[00:25:08.278 --> 00:25:11.079]  Terry Crews admits Hollywood's dark secret.
[00:25:11.099 --> 00:25:11.620]  Here's Mark Dice.
[00:25:12.588 --> 00:25:23.176]  While the mainstream media is finally talking about the corrupt casting couch culture of Hollywood, we're gonna go deep into the heart of Hollywood in this video, and talk about what you won't see or hear in the mainstream media.
[00:25:23.416 --> 00:25:39.928]  In fact, this Harvey Weinstein story was killed by the New York Times 13 years ago, and when NBC's reporter Ronan Farrow wanted to do his expose, NBC refused to publish it, and so he went to the New Yorker, which then thankfully did, which is what started opening this big can of worms.
[00:25:40.268 --> 00:25:48.530]  And now the head of Amazon Studios, Roy Price, since they create original programming as well, has been suspended for similar sexual harassment allegations.
[00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:58.972]  As more women continue to come forward with stories of harassment and other abuse at the hands of Harvey Weinstein, this still is just the tip of the iceberg of what goes on behind the scenes in Hollywood.
[00:25:59.192 --> 00:26:08.534]  An even darker secret that's just beginning to be uncovered is the fact that gay Hollywood executives also harass and also sexually assault male actors as well.
[00:26:08.934 --> 00:26:18.963]  As difficult as it is for women to come forward after they've been sexually harassed or assaulted by high-level Hollywood producers, imagine how much more difficult it must be for men who face homosexual harassment.
[00:26:19.163 --> 00:26:27.810]  Terry Crews, who's been in a bunch of television shows and movies, has come forward to say that he was not only just sexually harassed by a high-level gay executive, but sexually assaulted.
[00:26:28.091 --> 00:26:29.131]  This guy's like a 230-pound former NFL player,
[00:26:30.913 --> 00:26:37.976]  And he was afraid to come forward and say anything about it until the stories about Harvey Weinstein started circulating and he finally decided to speak up.
[00:26:38.236 --> 00:26:49.380]  And now James Van Der Beek, star of the teen drama Dawson's Creek, has just come forward and said that he too was sexually assaulted, not just harassed, sexually assaulted by a gay Hollywood executive.
[00:26:49.540 --> 00:27:02.223]  Most likely there's dozens if not more actors who are household names who have also been victims of homosexual harassment and sexual assault but most of them will never speak up because they don't want to be perceived as being homophobic or cross the Hollywood gay mafia.
[00:27:02.403 --> 00:27:17.227]  Here's Chris Rock at the Oscars last year who was making fun of everybody after they won until Sam Smith won an Oscar for best movie soundtrack and decided to announce to the audience that it was a victory for gay people and then Chris Rock was afraid to crack any jokes because he didn't want to get in trouble.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.861]  Congratulations, no jokes there.
[00:27:20.681 --> 00:27:24.202]  Not gonna get me in trouble.
[00:27:24.342 --> 00:27:25.363]  Oh, don't wanna get in trouble?
[00:27:25.403 --> 00:27:26.583]  Can't make fun of gay people.
[00:27:26.783 --> 00:27:27.964]  They're above reproach.
[00:27:28.244 --> 00:27:39.488]  In fact, after the CEO of Mozilla, that's the creator of Firefox, the popular internet browser, Brandon Eich, was exposed as not supporting gay marriage, he was forced out of the company that he created.
[00:27:39.648 --> 00:27:47.391]  Bill Maher was even shocked and came to the CEO's defense, but did say that he thinks that there is a, quote, gay mafia, and that he, too, was afraid to cross them.
[00:27:47.611 --> 00:27:51.654]  Here's rapper Fat Joe on what he calls the gay mafia in the entertainment industry.
[00:27:51.955 --> 00:27:54.357]  I happen to think there's a gay mafia in hip-hop.
[00:27:54.697 --> 00:27:54.937]  Right.
[00:27:54.997 --> 00:27:55.918]  Not rappers.
[00:27:56.298 --> 00:28:06.987]  You know, the editorial presidents of magazines, the PDs at radio stations, the people who give you award at award shows.
[00:28:07.348 --> 00:28:09.670]  This is a f***ing gay mafia, my man.
[00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:10.010]  Right.
[00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:11.131]  Like, you know what I'm saying?
[00:28:11.151 --> 00:28:12.212]  They are in power.
[00:28:12.532 --> 00:28:16.015]  Did you hear DJ Vlad off camera agreeing to everything that he was saying?
[00:28:16.275 --> 00:28:21.779]  Even Harvey Levin, the head of TMZ, who himself is gay, admits that there is a gay mafia in Hollywood.
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:27.484]  He says that it's not a criminal organization, more or less a very powerful political organization.
[00:28:27.784 --> 00:28:30.246]  But us normal people aren't supposed to talk about that.
[00:28:30.406 --> 00:28:39.293]  We're also not supposed to talk about the fact that since President Obama repealed Don't Ask, Don't Tell, and allowed gays into the military, that there is an epidemic of gay men raping others.
[00:28:39.433 --> 00:28:40.674]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[00:28:40.874 --> 00:28:41.414]  Absolutely.
[00:28:41.454 --> 00:28:43.176]  Just like with children, it's all about power.
[00:28:43.196 --> 00:28:44.637]  I'm not saying all homosexuals.
[00:28:45.117 --> 00:28:45.257]  Okay?
[00:28:45.277 --> 00:28:47.940]  And I'm going to use the word homosexual because we're told to use the word gay.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.422]  I'm sick of people telling me what words to use.
[00:28:51.082 --> 00:28:51.362]  Okay?
[00:28:51.503 --> 00:28:55.206]  You've got these same groups assaulting children now, telling them they're a different gender.
[00:28:55.426 --> 00:28:57.728]  As Camille Paglia said, it's child abuse.
[00:28:58.048 --> 00:28:58.488]  Admit it.
[00:28:58.709 --> 00:28:59.609]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:59.689 --> 00:29:01.291]  There is a satanic mafia.
[00:29:03.152 --> 00:29:04.694]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running
[00:29:05.956 --> 00:29:11.280]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:12.681]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[00:29:12.921 --> 00:29:15.223]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[00:29:15.903 --> 00:29:22.408]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[00:29:22.608 --> 00:29:25.950]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:28.072]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[00:29:28.712 --> 00:29:37.142]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[00:29:37.162 --> 00:29:38.123]  They know how great it is.
[00:29:39.044 --> 00:29:42.788]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[00:29:43.729 --> 00:29:45.131]  Tropic means for the brain.
[00:29:45.931 --> 00:29:53.799]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:30:00.046]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[00:30:05.251 --> 00:30:05.691]  That comes to $50.03.
[00:30:05.911 --> 00:30:09.853]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[00:30:10.273 --> 00:30:13.415]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[00:30:13.455 --> 00:30:14.415]  It's a good deal at $39.
[00:30:15.596 --> 00:30:16.316]  It's $19.96 at Infowarslife.com.

[00:31:35.982 --> 00:31:36.442]  And more.
[00:31:36.943 --> 00:31:37.583]  Concentrate.
[00:31:37.603 --> 00:31:39.384]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[00:31:39.645 --> 00:31:41.066]  Next level compared to whey.
[00:31:41.086 --> 00:31:42.907]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shanks.
[00:31:43.327 --> 00:31:44.208]  It's incredible.
[00:31:44.668 --> 00:31:46.589]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[00:31:46.769 --> 00:31:47.930]  It's bigger than I am already.
[00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:49.291]  At 15, incredible.
[00:31:49.611 --> 00:31:50.492]  It is amazing.
[00:31:50.852 --> 00:31:52.553]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:52.894 --> 00:31:53.674]  50% off Caveman.
[00:31:53.894 --> 00:31:55.235]  But only a few days left.
[00:31:55.475 --> 00:31:56.236]  It's about to end.
[00:31:56.816 --> 00:31:59.158]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[00:31:59.598 --> 00:32:04.761]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[00:32:05.181 --> 00:32:06.582]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[00:32:06.822 --> 00:32:07.983]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[00:32:08.363 --> 00:32:09.184]  I want to thank you.
[00:32:09.504 --> 00:32:10.564]  We're all in this together.

[00:32:27.692 --> 00:32:37.115]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer Brain Force at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.

[00:33:05.612 --> 00:33:08.274]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:16.989 --> 00:33:25.973]  There's a need for a new world order, but it has different characteristics in different parts of the world.
[00:33:27.374 --> 00:33:33.677]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:36.018 --> 00:33:38.079]  Georgina Chapman, the vampire-like.
[00:33:39.602 --> 00:33:41.723]  Beard for Weinstein.
[00:33:42.744 --> 00:33:46.325]  When I say beard, I mean just for his out-of-control activities with women.
[00:33:48.386 --> 00:33:49.407]  His wife for show.
[00:33:50.227 --> 00:33:51.248]  His wife for breeding.
[00:33:52.428 --> 00:33:56.590]  She knew he was pressuring and threatening people's careers that didn't buy her clothes, didn't wear her clothes.
[00:33:57.150 --> 00:33:58.671]  She knew she was bearing a gangster thug.
[00:33:58.691 --> 00:34:03.854]  Oh, but now, you know, she's so upset.
[00:34:03.914 --> 00:34:06.075]  When this was a joke all over Hollywood, everybody knew.
[00:34:06.095 --> 00:34:08.576]  Well, now they're reporting that she's leaning on
[00:34:10.891 --> 00:34:16.496]  Uma Abedin for help to understand what it's like to be married to a predator.
[00:34:18.238 --> 00:34:21.300]  Uma Abedin knows full well what she's involved in, is a horrible person.
[00:34:21.861 --> 00:34:26.905]  Her mother writes the top Islamic papers on cutting women's genitals off.
[00:34:28.987 --> 00:34:31.009]  And I've seen late night comedians make jokes about it before.
[00:34:31.269 --> 00:34:33.891]  How do you cut a woman's genitals off, Alex?
[00:34:34.232 --> 00:34:34.772]  They know.
[00:34:35.293 --> 00:34:37.655]  And I'm not going to get into it graphically, you sickos.
[00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:42.291]  Truly disgusting vampire people.
[00:34:43.372 --> 00:34:45.313]  But they were showing me in the control room.
[00:34:45.333 --> 00:34:46.974]  We're going to tweet this out on Real Alex Jones.
[00:34:47.414 --> 00:34:57.841]  The Week magazine, a news publication, leftist publication, has an image of Weinstein in a white, creepy bathrobe.
[00:34:59.001 --> 00:35:02.704]  It's an editorial cartoon and behind him is Bill O'Reilly and Donald Trump.
[00:35:02.724 --> 00:35:08.127]  And it says, she no evil while powerful men get away with sexual abuse.
[00:35:09.648 --> 00:35:09.888]  Oh yeah?
[00:35:13.274 --> 00:35:28.083]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's people like Weinstein that dwarf anything O'Reilly ever even thought about with his weird pervert talk and the transcripts from the trials and the bizarre stuff that he would say to women.
[00:35:28.123 --> 00:35:29.244]  It was super creepy bad.
[00:35:29.264 --> 00:35:30.484]  He paid millions of dollars out.
[00:35:30.584 --> 00:35:30.905]  Okay.
[00:35:31.685 --> 00:35:32.526]  The guy's a thug.
[00:35:33.586 --> 00:35:36.468]  The guy's a leftist posing as a conservative.
[00:35:36.848 --> 00:35:38.509]  But you look at Trump, he's deliberate.
[00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:41.151]  And I happen to know women.
[00:35:42.381 --> 00:35:44.481]  That when he's been in between marriages have dated Trump.
[00:35:45.742 --> 00:36:06.826]  And I happen to know the whole backstory folks, not just from Roger Stone and people, but from a lot of other folks and a lot of it's actually been even in the New York Times back before he was such a political figure, that Trump courts women and takes them out many times and he just won't jump in bed with anybody and he's a clean freak.
[00:36:07.186 --> 00:36:10.747]  That's what no one knows, that Trump is a clean freak
[00:36:11.906 --> 00:36:18.249]  When it comes to relationships, everything, and he is a one woman man when he's with that woman.
[00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:26.473]  Gifts, money, everything super nice to him until the minute they're not and then he's gone.
[00:36:27.434 --> 00:36:28.374]  That's Donald Trump.
[00:36:31.636 --> 00:36:31.756]  And
[00:36:33.447 --> 00:36:38.471]  He's in that bus, and the guy's talking to him about women, and he goes, yeah, it's incredible when you're a TV star.
[00:36:38.531 --> 00:36:40.532]  Now the women just throw themselves at you.
[00:36:40.552 --> 00:36:41.913]  And he's like an old schooler.
[00:36:41.954 --> 00:36:43.715]  He's like, yeah, you just grab them however you want.
[00:36:43.735 --> 00:36:45.516]  Well, yeah, a woman's climbing up on you.
[00:36:45.536 --> 00:36:47.478]  You know, the sign is they jump on you.
[00:36:49.864 --> 00:37:01.831]  And then it's a mammal mating ritual in primates, but especially in Homo sapiens, that you then caress their buttocks, their hips, up the stomach to the chest, kissing.
[00:37:01.872 --> 00:37:02.972]  This is a mating ritual.
[00:37:03.172 --> 00:37:09.696]  You know, certain types of birds hop certain ways, do certain dances, and whippoorwills have their songs, and creatures mate.
[00:37:10.217 --> 00:37:11.798]  Different whale species have their stuff.
[00:37:11.838 --> 00:37:12.578]  It's not bad.
[00:37:13.459 --> 00:37:14.980]  So when a woman jumps on you,
[00:37:16.553 --> 00:37:18.914]  Or you're Elvis Presley and they're throwing their panties at you.
[00:37:19.394 --> 00:37:20.494]  What do you think that means?
[00:37:20.574 --> 00:37:22.214]  It means we want to mate with you.
[00:37:22.615 --> 00:37:24.515]  That's not bad, that's wholesome, that's good.
[00:37:24.535 --> 00:37:27.936]  Is it a little uncouth for him to have locker room talk?
[00:37:28.856 --> 00:37:29.696]  Yeah, 12 years ago.
[00:37:29.716 --> 00:37:39.999]  But you know, most men are hypocrites if you haven't been in a locker room or lifting weights or something.
[00:37:43.303 --> 00:37:45.265]  And made comments about your girlfriend or your wife.
[00:37:45.565 --> 00:37:46.366]  And not bad ones.
[00:37:47.427 --> 00:37:48.668]  I mean, I made the comment about my wife.
[00:37:48.708 --> 00:37:49.529]  She's not street legal.
[00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:53.993]  And by that, it's like a 10,000 horsepower car.
[00:37:54.033 --> 00:37:55.514]  You're not supposed to put that on the street.
[00:37:55.854 --> 00:37:58.016]  Sean, if you want to race, get on a racetrack.
[00:37:58.497 --> 00:38:00.078]  That's got too much horsepower.
[00:38:00.378 --> 00:38:02.120]  What are you doing with that out here on the street?
[00:38:04.662 --> 00:38:06.444]  Now, that's a compliment to my wife.
[00:38:07.364 --> 00:38:08.906]  And it's a little racy, pun intended.
[00:38:10.111 --> 00:38:10.911]  But she's alive.
[00:38:11.732 --> 00:38:27.500]  They're trying to make normal behavior bad, and then make it all about men hitting on women, and then tie that to men raping women and act like the two are the same, and then cover up all the pedophilia and the devil worship and the sexualization of children and all the real stuff that's going on everywhere.
[00:38:29.701 --> 00:38:30.681]  It really is incredible.
[00:38:33.523 --> 00:38:35.504]  We're waiting for the President in the next 20 minutes or so.
[00:38:36.064 --> 00:38:37.205]  He says the next five, but
[00:38:39.713 --> 00:38:39.933]  Hmm.
[00:38:40.954 --> 00:38:42.394]  He's usually about 10-15 minutes late.
[00:38:42.794 --> 00:38:43.595]  We'll see what happens.
[00:38:45.096 --> 00:38:49.077]  But, we're gonna shift gears in a bunch of other subjects today.
[00:38:50.358 --> 00:39:01.443]  It's just, you can see how, if you look at the Week magazine, it should have Weiner and Bill Clinton behind Weinstein.
[00:39:02.023 --> 00:39:07.206]  And they knew all this was coming out, and they knew they couldn't cover it up, and they knew there was rape information that was gonna come out.
[00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:10.888]  And so what did they do?
[00:39:13.511 --> 00:39:18.055]  They brought this Weinstein situation out as a controlled demolition.
[00:39:18.095 --> 00:39:23.060]  It's like you use TNT to blow up an oil field fire that's ignited.
[00:39:23.321 --> 00:39:30.388]  You use the bling blast to put out the rest of it and just make it a news cycle and get people conditioned and sick of hearing about it.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:43.473]  When the whole pedophile dam is breaking, and the sexual assault dam is breaking, and the devil worship, and the blood drinking, and the eyes wide shut stuff, that's what's really going on.
[00:39:44.033 --> 00:39:49.699]  You don't think Weinstein just stops with forcing women into bathrooms and watching him bathe.
[00:39:49.739 --> 00:39:51.241]  He does it because he's hideous.
[00:39:53.362 --> 00:39:56.643]  He does it because he wants to dominate their innocence.
[00:39:57.064 --> 00:40:05.687]  That's why you learn now, oh, it's 17-year-old girls and 16-year-old girls that he's been bringing in over the decades.
[00:40:05.928 --> 00:40:06.828]  Absolutely.
[00:40:07.608 --> 00:40:09.949]  You look at the women he likes, they look like little girls.
[00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:13.791]  What do you think's going on with this guy?
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:22.802]  Quentin Tarantino, stunned and heartbroken, still processing.
[00:40:23.222 --> 00:40:25.523]  Oh, what a big fancy word.
[00:40:25.543 --> 00:40:28.945]  He's still processing Weinstein's mess.
[00:40:30.185 --> 00:40:32.846]  I mean, he hadn't made a good film since Pulp Fiction.
[00:40:35.067 --> 00:40:38.269]  And that itself is super disturbing, with men raping men.
[00:40:47.008 --> 00:40:47.949]  Total race baiting.
[00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:51.673]  A white racist guy raping a black man.
[00:40:54.837 --> 00:40:57.520]  Another man chained up living in a box.
[00:40:58.961 --> 00:40:59.782]  Bring out the gimp.
[00:41:01.725 --> 00:41:02.566]  The gimp's sleeping.
[00:41:03.887 --> 00:41:06.390]  Well, you'll just have to wake him up now, won't you?
[00:41:10.427 --> 00:41:10.707]  All right.
[00:41:11.407 --> 00:41:14.308]  Vegas has completely collapsed and I just can't believe it's not even bigger news.
[00:41:14.348 --> 00:41:16.349]  It's like, okay, everything's fake now.
[00:41:16.369 --> 00:41:18.750]  And the security guard was supposed to go on Hannity last night.
[00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:19.590]  He just disappeared.
[00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:21.151]  Maybe he sleeps with the fishes.
[00:41:23.451 --> 00:41:23.852]  What's that?
[00:41:23.872 --> 00:41:25.352]  It's a Sicilian message.
[00:41:25.372 --> 00:41:31.174]  We're going to come back and get into all the world news.
[00:41:31.194 --> 00:41:31.994]  It's very, very serious.
[00:41:32.014 --> 00:41:32.755]  The economic news.
[00:41:32.775 --> 00:41:33.915]  The leftists are panicking.
[00:41:34.415 --> 00:41:35.496]  They're pulling their hair out.
[00:41:35.536 --> 00:41:36.316]  They don't know what to do.
[00:41:38.925 --> 00:41:48.193]  There's that article, gay rape in military, unreported by Pentagon, up 15-fold since they told folks to come out of the closet.
[00:41:51.436 --> 00:41:54.659]  And now they don't have to worry about anybody else trying to stop them.
[00:41:57.001 --> 00:41:58.663]  And they know other men aren't going to say anything.
[00:41:58.683 --> 00:42:04.208]  Because, you know, it'd be embarrassing if five guys held you down and raped you.
[00:42:06.823 --> 00:42:09.105]  That's okay, because it's gay, see?
[00:42:09.685 --> 00:42:11.026]  Men getting raped's alright.
[00:42:12.447 --> 00:42:13.388]  Our men can take it.
[00:42:13.948 --> 00:42:14.528]  They're tough.
[00:42:15.009 --> 00:42:15.929]  They won't say anything about it.
[00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:26.217]  And believe me, folks, if the scumbags in Hollywood three times grabbed me by the genitals in meetings, just walk up, boom!
[00:42:26.797 --> 00:42:28.799]  I mean, it must be like a handshake or something.
[00:42:33.802 --> 00:42:34.403]  And you watch.
[00:42:35.646 --> 00:42:40.508]  The leftist gay mafia and the rest of them are going to make big jokes out of this to see sexual assault to Alex Jones.
[00:42:40.548 --> 00:42:41.328]  That's funny!
[00:42:42.489 --> 00:42:43.909]  But I didn't even think of it as assault.
[00:42:43.949 --> 00:42:49.491]  It was like a weird handshake ritual of dominance to see what I'd do.
[00:42:50.192 --> 00:42:50.652]  Yeah, there you go.
[00:42:50.672 --> 00:42:52.452]  There's Pulp Fiction right there.
[00:42:52.472 --> 00:42:56.214]  The fantasy with bondage, torture, raping men.
[00:42:56.794 --> 00:42:58.655]  Hollywood's letting you know what they're into, folks.
[00:42:59.275 --> 00:43:02.376]  They're not into puppy dogs and kittens unless they're electrocuting them.
[00:43:02.396 --> 00:43:03.937]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we're running
[00:43:05.208 --> 00:43:10.531]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[00:43:10.791 --> 00:43:11.912]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[00:43:12.172 --> 00:43:14.473]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[00:43:15.134 --> 00:43:21.657]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[00:43:21.858 --> 00:43:25.199]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.321]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[00:43:27.961 --> 00:43:36.390]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[00:43:36.411 --> 00:43:37.372]  They know how great it is.
[00:43:38.293 --> 00:43:42.077]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[00:43:42.898 --> 00:43:44.339]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:53.045]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[00:43:53.465 --> 00:44:02.211]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[00:44:02.511 --> 00:44:04.933]  That comes to 50.03.
[00:44:05.073 --> 00:44:09.115]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[00:44:09.516 --> 00:44:12.498]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[00:44:14.839 --> 00:44:15.699]  It's a good deal at $39.
[00:44:15.799 --> 00:44:27.043]  It's 1996 at Infowarslife.com or simply call toll-free 888-253-3139.

[00:45:02.556 --> 00:45:20.352]  I want to just briefly thank listeners for their support of the broadcast and remind listeners that we are listener supported and it is your financial support getting good products in return that you need and that symbiotic relationship and that 360 win that makes everything here we do possible.
[00:45:21.073 --> 00:45:26.398]  And we're not just going to have to end the next week the Brain Force Plus special 50% off.
[00:45:26.758 --> 00:45:35.667]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our caveman ultimate paleo bone broth, turmeric, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, and more.
[00:45:36.187 --> 00:45:36.808]  Concentrate.
[00:45:36.848 --> 00:45:38.629]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[00:45:38.890 --> 00:45:40.251]  Next level compared to whey.
[00:45:40.271 --> 00:45:42.173]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[00:45:42.573 --> 00:45:43.454]  It's incredible.
[00:45:43.934 --> 00:45:45.836]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[00:45:46.016 --> 00:45:47.177]  It's bigger than I am already.
[00:45:47.638 --> 00:45:48.538]  At 15, incredible.
[00:45:48.859 --> 00:45:49.739]  It is amazing.
[00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:51.361]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:45:52.142 --> 00:45:52.922]  50% off Caveman.
[00:45:53.143 --> 00:45:54.484]  But only a few days left.
[00:45:54.724 --> 00:45:55.485]  It's about to end.
[00:45:56.065 --> 00:45:58.406]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[00:45:58.826 --> 00:46:04.008]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[00:46:04.428 --> 00:46:05.829]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[00:46:06.069 --> 00:46:07.229]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[00:46:07.609 --> 00:46:08.430]  I want to thank you.
[00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:09.810]  We're all in this together.
[00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:20.214]  And when you get the great Molon Labe t-shirts, and you get the great books and videos, and when you get the great water filtration, you help yourself, you help your family, when you get the great air filtration systems, all of them,

[00:46:26.436 --> 00:46:36.359]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer Brain Force at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.
[00:46:36.619 --> 00:46:41.981]  But again, thank you all for your support because this helps fund our operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.

[00:46:55.747 --> 00:47:00.569]  That's 50% off Brain Force Plus, 50% off Caveman, but only for one week.
[00:47:06.032 --> 00:47:08.633]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:24.568 --> 00:47:25.468]  You found it.
[00:47:25.749 --> 00:47:28.410]  The front lines of the human awakening.
[00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:30.630]  It's the Infowar.
[00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:32.791]  And now, Alex Jones.
[00:47:33.091 --> 00:47:35.912]  There must be some kind of way out of here.
[00:47:36.192 --> 00:47:39.014]  Say the joker to the thief.
[00:47:39.114 --> 00:47:40.834]  There's too much confusion.
[00:47:41.795 --> 00:47:43.295]  There's too much confusion.
[00:47:43.435 --> 00:47:45.136]  I can't get no relief.
[00:47:46.176 --> 00:47:50.138]  I can't get no relief.
[00:47:50.338 --> 00:47:53.239]  Business man, dear, drink my wine.
[00:47:54.085 --> 00:47:56.906]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:47:56.966 --> 00:48:09.871]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we are going to be going to the President's live briefing on a crackdown on Iran, as he promised he'd do during the campaign.
[00:48:10.971 --> 00:48:13.092]  He just keeps doing what he said he'd do.
[00:48:13.632 --> 00:48:21.395]  Some of it I don't even completely agree with, but I do agree with him doing what he says he'll do, and the world respects that.
[00:48:23.428 --> 00:48:27.595]  You notice that we see the best new jobs numbers since 1984.
[00:48:27.655 --> 00:48:30.499]  We have the best economic outlook in 13 years.
[00:48:33.939 --> 00:48:36.100]  We have the biggest stock market ever.
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:39.082]  And so many people say, I'm not in the stock market, I don't care.
[00:48:39.442 --> 00:48:41.903]  That shows mega massive ignorance.
[00:48:42.463 --> 00:48:43.444]  Yeah, it's a bubble.
[00:48:43.544 --> 00:48:44.864]  Yeah, a lot of us overvalued.
[00:48:45.265 --> 00:48:47.306]  The globalists have been using it to get power.
[00:48:48.006 --> 00:48:53.148]  Now Trump's taken it away to a certain extent, using it to actually get America supercharged.
[00:48:53.729 --> 00:48:55.390]  And now they want to pop the bubble.
[00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:57.851]  Now they want to see it go down.
[00:48:58.831 --> 00:49:00.312]  So I am a contrarian.
[00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:06.463]  And then PolitiFact says true!
[00:49:06.824 --> 00:49:08.907]  Well, PolitiFact's actually trying to be honest these days.
[00:49:09.168 --> 00:49:10.189]  They've turned into such jokes.
[00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:12.774]  Is it true that the U.S.
[00:49:13.174 --> 00:49:15.177]  has the best job report in 16 years?
[00:49:15.538 --> 00:49:16.860]  PolitiFact says true!
[00:49:18.345 --> 00:49:23.607]  Now I have to check it, because PolitiFact also said all 16 agencies said Russia stole the election.
[00:49:23.707 --> 00:49:24.308]  None of it was true.
[00:49:25.268 --> 00:49:30.030]  And they also said that I made up the fact that there were reports of two shooters in Vegas.
[00:49:30.330 --> 00:49:36.833]  I mean, just a lot of what PolitiFact says is bull, but they've been so embarrassed by all this now, they have to admit the truth.
[00:49:37.634 --> 00:49:40.695]  And that's the good news here, is that people are
[00:49:42.245 --> 00:49:49.829]  Understanding that the globalists use the American economy to leverage out across the world and consolidate power and control.
[00:49:51.390 --> 00:50:00.595]  And now they're done with America and want to create austerity and make us poor so that they can control our lives.
[00:50:00.635 --> 00:50:03.396]  And I know I harp on that.
[00:50:04.797 --> 00:50:09.379]  But the reason I harp on that is because that's their unfair system.
[00:50:09.439 --> 00:50:10.240]  That's the great
[00:50:11.798 --> 00:50:12.318]  Oppression.
[00:50:14.039 --> 00:50:19.521]  That's the true discrimination.
[00:50:21.962 --> 00:50:25.403]  If you just go to DrudgeReport.com, that's where you guys can show the latest job numbers.
[00:50:26.103 --> 00:50:27.484]  It's also on NewsWars.com.
[00:50:27.504 --> 00:50:28.104]  There it is right there.
[00:50:28.764 --> 00:50:31.765]  Consumer sentiment hits 13-year high.
[00:50:32.805 --> 00:50:34.566]  Stocks set new records.
[00:50:34.586 --> 00:50:39.828]  And what's the response of John McCain?
[00:50:43.035 --> 00:50:49.039]  Down below, he says he wants to keep taxes where they are, maybe raise them, because that way it'll stop the economy growing.
[00:50:49.339 --> 00:50:51.360]  I mean, these people are villains.
[00:50:52.081 --> 00:50:57.324]  All they need is the pencil mustaches, curled like Dick Dastardly or whatever his name is.
[00:50:57.344 --> 00:51:00.806]  Remember those shows where they're flying airplanes around with Muttley?
[00:51:01.186 --> 00:51:03.708]  Muttley's laughing and then the bad guy's always crashing.
[00:51:03.748 --> 00:51:03.928]  I mean,
[00:51:04.508 --> 00:51:14.112]  These people would go out of their way a million miles to screw somebody over because they hate themselves and they're projecting their hatred of themselves on everybody else.
[00:51:14.152 --> 00:51:16.653]  That's what's happening.
[00:51:16.673 --> 00:51:18.654]  And of course, there's one thing that psychologists get right.
[00:51:18.674 --> 00:51:19.675]  You know, Trump likes himself.
[00:51:19.715 --> 00:51:20.195]  He's confident.
[00:51:20.215 --> 00:51:20.975]  He's not a narcissist.
[00:51:21.335 --> 00:51:22.076]  He's confident.
[00:51:22.116 --> 00:51:22.916]  He wants to be a winner.
[00:51:23.396 --> 00:51:24.437]  He wants to tell people to be winners.
[00:51:24.877 --> 00:51:27.098]  But he also believes people can make their own decisions in life.
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:33.441]  And so they want to destroy him.
[00:51:33.661 --> 00:51:35.242]  So they want to destroy us.
[00:51:35.803 --> 00:51:42.808]  Just like Project Veritas was on yesterday with their latest video inside the New York Times and Google.
[00:51:43.469 --> 00:51:53.537]  And they've got one of their top people, liaisons, with the New York Times and YouTube saying, we force people to watch our videos and our main mission is to block Alex Jones.
[00:51:56.693 --> 00:51:59.556]  And you get into internal Democrat Party strategy meetings.
[00:51:59.576 --> 00:52:01.577]  They go, we must stop Alex Jones.
[00:52:02.038 --> 00:52:03.399]  We must stop Alex Jones.
[00:52:05.561 --> 00:52:07.222]  Now, do you think that puts me on a power trip?
[00:52:07.242 --> 00:52:07.302]  No.
[00:52:07.823 --> 00:52:08.543]  It freaks me out.
[00:52:08.583 --> 00:52:11.526]  Because if I'm the best we've got, and Trump's the best we've got,
[00:52:13.328 --> 00:52:16.191]  Trump has his problems and so do I. But here's the difference.
[00:52:16.211 --> 00:52:20.315]  We're not afraid of these people, and they're not breaking our will, and we're not out to get you.
[00:52:20.836 --> 00:52:22.317]  And we understand they're scum.
[00:52:22.918 --> 00:52:24.299]  And we understand they're authoritarian.
[00:52:24.319 --> 00:52:25.520]  We understand they're illegitimate.
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:27.522]  And we're not backing down.
[00:52:28.783 --> 00:52:31.426]  I don't want red carpets or helicopter landing pads.
[00:52:31.446 --> 00:52:32.948]  I don't want everybody kissing my butt.
[00:52:34.609 --> 00:52:36.051]  I want people around me that are real.
[00:52:37.415 --> 00:52:38.475]  But I want my freedom.
[00:52:38.515 --> 00:52:39.235]  That's what I want.
[00:52:39.355 --> 00:52:40.336]  I want to run my own life.
[00:52:40.656 --> 00:52:42.176]  That's the gold I'm looking for.
[00:52:42.196 --> 00:52:43.276]  I want my children to be free.
[00:52:43.936 --> 00:52:45.197]  I want to be an honorable people.
[00:52:45.797 --> 00:52:46.537]  I want to be strong.
[00:52:46.557 --> 00:52:48.097]  And I want to have a future.
[00:52:49.118 --> 00:52:53.198]  These globalists think they're going to be God, merged with the machines, and humanity's bad.
[00:52:53.358 --> 00:52:58.360]  Again, they're projecting onto us the fact that they're so fallen, they're so failed.
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:03.341]  And humanity is coming out of a deep hibernation.
[00:53:03.581 --> 00:53:04.661]  Again, is the President speaking yet?
[00:53:06.581 --> 00:53:07.843]  He usually speaks about 10 minutes late.
[00:53:09.645 --> 00:53:10.746]  As soon as he does, we'll go to it.
[00:53:12.128 --> 00:53:13.289]  On this Iran situation.
[00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:17.654]  Just briefly, if you want to support the broadcast, I mean, it really is an act of resistance.
[00:53:18.035 --> 00:53:20.017]  If you're not supporting the broadcast, I'm not complaining.
[00:53:21.139 --> 00:53:21.920]  You've made your choice.
[00:53:22.661 --> 00:53:23.281]  Because if you're not,
[00:53:24.449 --> 00:53:48.908]  Actively sharing the videos and articles, and if you're not actively getting great supplements and great nootropics and great products and great t-shirts, Molon Labe, and a whole bunch of new designs, we've got your choice, a line made in America that costs five to ten dollars more, and we have the lines made in El Salvador and Mexico and places that on average are better than, you know, getting them in China or whatever, but the point is it's your choice at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:53:49.668 --> 00:53:50.368]  My fellow Americans,
[00:54:18.044 --> 00:54:27.267]  As President of the United States, my highest obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American people.
[00:54:28.567 --> 00:54:35.350]  History has shown that the longer we ignore a threat, the more dangerous that threat becomes.
[00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:38.631]  For this reason, upon taking office,
[00:54:39.804 --> 00:54:48.751]  I've ordered a complete strategic review of our policy toward the rogue regime in Iran.
[00:54:50.352 --> 00:54:51.813]  That review is now complete.
[00:54:53.014 --> 00:55:08.966]  Today, I am announcing our strategy, along with several major steps we are taking to confront the Iranian regime's hostile actions and to ensure that Iran never, and I mean never,
[00:55:10.467 --> 00:55:33.139]  Acquires a nuclear weapon Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian dictatorship Its sponsorship of terrorism and its continuing aggression in the Middle East and all around the world Iran is under the control of
[00:55:34.335 --> 00:55:44.802]  of a fanatical regime that seized power in 1979 and forced a proud people to submit to its extremist rule.
[00:55:44.822 --> 00:55:59.652]  This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the world's oldest and most vibrant nations and spread death, destruction, and chaos all around the globe.
[00:56:01.273 --> 00:56:01.794]  Beginning in 1979,
[00:56:04.435 --> 00:56:09.336]  Agents of the Iranian regime illegally seized the U.S.
[00:56:09.396 --> 00:56:18.997]  Embassy in Tehran and held more than 60 Americans hostage during the 444 days of the crisis.
[00:56:20.578 --> 00:56:28.479]  The Iranian-backed terrorist group Hezbollah twice bombed our embassy in Lebanon, once in 1983 and again in 1984.
[00:56:34.201 --> 00:56:49.628]  Another Iranian-supported bombing killed 241 Americans, service members they were, in their barracks in Beirut in 1983.
[00:56:49.768 --> 00:56:58.332]  In 1996, the regime directed another bombing of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:15.274]  Iranian proxies provided training to operatives who were later involved in al-Qaeda's bombing of the American embassies in Kenya, Tanzania, and two years later killing 224 people
[00:57:17.665 --> 00:57:19.226]  Boy, this sounds like the build-up to war.
[00:57:19.246 --> 00:57:20.347]  I don't like this.
[00:57:20.687 --> 00:57:23.569]  I don't like what Iran does either, but I tell you, this is serious.
[00:57:24.389 --> 00:57:24.930]  This is live.
[00:57:24.970 --> 00:57:28.512]  We can pause it, come back in a minute, and get to the rest of it for you.
[00:57:29.032 --> 00:57:30.633]  We've got some guests coming up today as well.
[00:57:31.434 --> 00:57:33.415]  But the President is doing what he said he would do.
[00:57:33.935 --> 00:57:34.636]  Stand up to Iran.
[00:57:34.656 --> 00:57:37.638]  Iran has been very belligerent, shooting our boats, grabbing our people.
[00:57:38.238 --> 00:57:40.820]  But he's enlisting all this stuff that Iran did to us.
[00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:42.801]  We funded Iraq to kill over a million of them.
[00:57:43.201 --> 00:57:45.603]  And Operation Praying Mantis, blowing up their Navy.
[00:57:46.323 --> 00:57:49.365]  So, I mean, it's not like we haven't been punching them in the nose.
[00:57:49.685 --> 00:57:50.305]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:50.325 --> 00:57:51.245]  But they are a dictatorship.
[00:57:52.646 --> 00:57:54.867]  And we're not getting what humans always thought was key.
[00:57:54.887 --> 00:57:55.247]  The bone broth.
[00:57:55.267 --> 00:57:55.628]  The bone broth.
[00:57:55.648 --> 00:57:55.928]  The bone broth.
[00:57:55.948 --> 00:57:56.368]  The bone broth.
[00:57:56.648 --> 00:57:57.008]  The bone broth.
[00:57:57.028 --> 00:57:57.329]  The bone broth.
[00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:58.049]  The bone broth.
[00:57:58.069 --> 00:57:58.469]  The bone broth.
[00:57:58.489 --> 00:57:58.789]  The bone broth.
[00:57:58.809 --> 00:57:59.350]  The bone broth.
[00:57:59.430 --> 00:57:59.750]  The bone broth.
[00:57:59.810 --> 00:58:00.310]  The bone broth.
[00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:00.830]  The bone broth.
[00:58:00.850 --> 00:58:01.190]  The bone broth.
[00:58:01.210 --> 00:58:01.511]  The bone broth.
[00:58:01.631 --> 00:58:02.231]  The bone broth.
[00:58:02.251 --> 00:58:02.631]  The bone broth.
[00:58:02.651 --> 00:58:02.951]  The bone broth.
[00:58:02.971 --> 00:58:03.652]  The bone broth.
[00:58:03.672 --> 00:58:03.972]  The bone broth.
[00:58:03.992 --> 00:58:04.312]  The bone broth.
[00:58:04.332 --> 00:58:04.612]  The bone broth.
[00:58:04.632 --> 00:58:04.952]  The bone broth.
[00:58:04.972 --> 00:58:05.332]  The bone broth.
[00:58:05.352 --> 00:58:05.633]  The bone broth.
[00:58:05.653 --> 00:58:05.933]  The bone broth.
[00:58:05.953 --> 00:58:06.833]  The bone broth.
[00:58:06.853 --> 00:58:07.173]  The bone broth.
[00:58:07.193 --> 00:58:07.494]  The bone broth.
[00:58:07.514 --> 00:58:07.814]  The bone broth.
[00:58:07.834 --> 00:58:08.294]  The bone broth.
[00:58:08.354 --> 00:58:08.654]  The bone broth.
[00:58:08.694 --> 00:58:09.394]  The bone broth.
[00:58:09.414 --> 00:58:09.695]  The bone broth.
[00:58:09.755 --> 00:58:10.135]  The bone broth.
[00:58:10.155 --> 00:58:10.755]  The bone broth.
[00:58:10.775 --> 00:58:11.095]  The bone broth.
[00:58:11.155 --> 00:58:11.435]  The bone broth.
[00:58:11.496 --> 00:58:12.116]  The bone broth.
[00:58:12.136 --> 00:58:12.456]  The bone broth.
[00:58:12.476 --> 00:58:12.776]  The bone broth.
[00:58:12.796 --> 00:58:13.096]  The bone broth.
[00:58:13.136 --> 00:58:13.577]  The bone broth.
[00:58:13.597 --> 00:58:13.937]  The bone broth.
[00:58:13.957 --> 00:58:14.237]  The bone broth.
[00:58:14.277 --> 00:58:14.417]  The
[00:58:15.265 --> 00:58:15.805]  It's unbelievable.
[00:58:16.265 --> 00:58:17.046]  It's unbelievable.
[00:58:17.746 --> 00:58:19.407]  Caveman is just over the top.
[00:58:19.907 --> 00:58:21.528]  What in the world?
[00:58:21.668 --> 00:58:25.169]  But now with the milk, I was like, whoa, this has milk in it.
[00:58:25.530 --> 00:58:26.630]  It tastes like good.
[00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:27.811]  Man, this tastes so good.
[00:58:29.031 --> 00:58:30.212]  Tastes like the best milkshake ever.
[00:58:30.752 --> 00:58:32.673]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:58:32.733 --> 00:58:34.053]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:58:34.133 --> 00:58:35.594]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:58:35.634 --> 00:58:36.434]  Like good.
[00:58:36.935 --> 00:58:38.275]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:58:38.335 --> 00:58:39.676]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:58:39.716 --> 00:58:41.196]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:58:41.236 --> 00:58:41.877]  Like good.
[00:58:43.866 --> 00:58:50.530]  I can say without a doubt, at least in my experience, this is a super home run available at InfoWarsLife.com and it supports the broadcast.
[00:58:50.650 --> 00:58:52.211]  Alright, all the big news straight ahead.

[00:59:54.999 --> 01:00:00.963]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:05.045 --> 01:00:07.807]  He's going the distance.
[01:00:07.867 --> 01:00:08.688]  He's going for speed.
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:20.601]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:00:20.961 --> 01:00:23.842]  We're going the distance, thanks to you.
[01:00:24.903 --> 01:00:27.604]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:00:27.644 --> 01:00:27.984]  Yeah!
[01:00:28.484 --> 01:00:29.845]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.065 --> 01:00:32.386]  Yeah, little doggie!
[01:00:36.728 --> 01:00:37.528]  Now...
[01:00:42.951 --> 01:00:44.772]  Let's put Operation Pragmatist on screen.
[01:00:44.792 --> 01:00:46.072]  And I'm not defending the mullahs.
[01:00:46.152 --> 01:00:46.672]  I don't like it.
[01:00:46.692 --> 01:00:48.593]  It's a religious dictatorship.
[01:00:48.613 --> 01:00:49.333]  Everybody knows that.
[01:00:50.473 --> 01:00:57.435]  My issue is that Iran polls show 70 plus percent of the population doesn't want to be under the mullahs or more.
[01:00:58.135 --> 01:01:00.375]  So the Iranian people are not our enemy.
[01:01:00.815 --> 01:01:02.676]  And I don't want to be enemies with the Muslims either.
[01:01:02.736 --> 01:01:03.676]  The point is is that
[01:01:05.402 --> 01:01:08.403]  Iran is the second player to Saudi Arabia.
[01:01:08.623 --> 01:01:10.263]  Saudi Arabia is the big problem.
[01:01:10.903 --> 01:01:13.164]  And it's got its own subdivisions.
[01:01:14.024 --> 01:01:19.165]  And I know Israel doesn't like Iran because they think Iran is just crazy enough, and believe me, they are, to actually use weapons.
[01:01:19.185 --> 01:01:21.305]  They're way more capable than most of the Arab regimes.
[01:01:21.905 --> 01:01:22.525]  They're Persians.
[01:01:23.406 --> 01:01:24.706]  And the U.S.
[01:01:24.726 --> 01:01:29.507]  funded a seven-year Iran-Iraq war that killed over a million and a half Iranians.
[01:01:29.567 --> 01:01:30.907]  So they don't like us.
[01:01:31.647 --> 01:01:33.748]  At least their brainwashed military doesn't.
[01:01:36.291 --> 01:01:38.232]  They've got nuclear weapons and Trump knows it.
[01:01:39.793 --> 01:01:42.614]  They've just never tested it because they know Israel will strike them the minute they do.
[01:01:43.214 --> 01:01:45.816]  And I have that ten years ago from the highest sources.
[01:01:46.516 --> 01:01:52.419]  They've got satellite technology and they've got aircraft snoops that can see radioactive material.
[01:01:52.439 --> 01:01:53.179]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:01:53.219 --> 01:01:54.600]  It's very classified information.
[01:01:55.918 --> 01:02:09.261]  But it's a lot more fancier than when you drive in to the Texas border from Mexico and you see these big spectrometer deals with these big, you know, antennas that look like a laser gun from the 50s, like a big laser cannon from Star Wars or something.
[01:02:10.101 --> 01:02:11.681]  Those are looking for radioactive stuff.
[01:02:11.701 --> 01:02:13.002]  Well, they got things much more powerful.
[01:02:13.502 --> 01:02:16.563]  Not just stuff at Border Patrol checkpoints that's 60-year-old technology.
[01:02:16.923 --> 01:02:18.003]  They know what Iran's got.
[01:02:19.023 --> 01:02:20.603]  Pakistan gave them hydrogen bombs.
[01:02:20.663 --> 01:02:23.164]  That's why I told you a decade ago Saudi Arabia has them.
[01:02:24.721 --> 01:02:40.587]  The big issue is Iran keeps, now that we're closing in defeating the ISIS folks that are Saudi Arabian based, Iran is now not going to really play ball in Syria with a new election like Assad promises.
[01:02:40.607 --> 01:02:43.088]  This is now Trump bringing pressure on them to make them do their deal.
[01:02:44.128 --> 01:02:45.109]  And they have agreed to this.
[01:02:46.389 --> 01:02:47.910]  That, again, is highly secret.
[01:02:47.970 --> 01:02:50.871]  We first told you five years ago, but that's our job here.
[01:02:52.011 --> 01:02:53.532]  But let's go ahead and go back to the President.
[01:02:55.696 --> 01:03:04.422]  In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military personnel.
[01:03:05.483 --> 01:03:11.968]  The Iranian dictatorship's aggression continues to this day.
[01:03:13.169 --> 01:03:20.435]  The regime remains the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism and provides assistance to al-Qaeda
[01:03:21.243 --> 01:03:27.586]  The Taliban, Hezbollah, Hamas, and other terrorist networks.
[01:03:28.747 --> 01:03:35.090]  It develops, deploys, and proliferates missiles that threaten American troops and our allies.
[01:03:35.971 --> 01:03:44.375]  It harasses American ships and threatens freedom of navigation in the Arabian Gulf and in the Red Sea.
[01:03:45.356 --> 01:03:49.078]  It imprisons Americans on false charges.
[01:03:50.051 --> 01:03:56.996]  And it launches cyber attacks against our critical infrastructure, financial system, and military.
[01:03:58.197 --> 01:04:06.644]  The United States is far from the only target of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed.
[01:04:07.585 --> 01:04:11.087]  The regime violently suppresses its own citizens.
[01:04:12.028 --> 01:04:17.953]  It shot unarmed student protesters in the street during the Green Revolution.
[01:04:18.959 --> 01:04:25.922]  This regime has fueled sectarian violence in Iraq and vicious civil wars.
[01:04:25.942 --> 01:04:32.606]  Alright, we're going to come back with more of this live conference, but it's still going on, but we've paused it as we go here.
[01:04:33.026 --> 01:04:38.489]  We have the live link up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com if you'd like to watch it without the interruptions here.
[01:04:39.329 --> 01:04:42.033]  But it's important to listen to your local stations and support those sponsors.
[01:04:42.053 --> 01:04:43.575]  Let me tell you, they're trying to shut down talk radio.
[01:04:43.635 --> 01:04:45.518]  It's like they're trying to shut down freedom on the internet.
[01:04:45.558 --> 01:04:47.621]  And it's important to support the local stations.
[01:04:47.701 --> 01:04:48.422]  I know you know that.
[01:04:48.442 --> 01:04:54.571]  I just want to remind you in your busy day to support the Info War because you're the only support we've got.
[01:04:54.791 --> 01:04:55.312]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:55.332 --> 01:04:55.673]  Stay with us.
[01:05:04.372 --> 01:05:09.275]  New from Emmerich's Essentials, fragrance-free natural deodorant for your body care needs.
[01:05:10.076 --> 01:05:12.998]  Playing basketball in the dry summer heat really makes me sweat.
[01:05:13.678 --> 01:05:16.480]  To maintain my game, I need all the confidence I can get.
[01:05:17.101 --> 01:05:21.984]  That's why I use Emmerich's Essentials natural deodorant, made with organic ingredients.
[01:05:22.344 --> 01:05:28.628]  This deodorant combines mineral crystals with natural botanicals to ionize odor, keeping me fresh throughout the day.
[01:05:29.008 --> 01:05:34.152]  While shooting hoops, the last thing I want is sweaty armpits making my hands slippery and the ball wet.
[01:05:34.832 --> 01:05:38.273]  That's why I recommend Emrix Essentials Fragrance-Free Deodorant.
[01:05:38.833 --> 01:05:46.656]  Even though it's unscented, it's effective at combating strong body odor, and I don't have to worry about any unwanted allergic reactions to my sensitive skin.
[01:05:47.216 --> 01:05:51.577]  Whether you're a guy or gal, the last thing you want to be worried about is your deodorant.
[01:05:51.898 --> 01:05:55.839]  No petroleum-based ingredients, 100% natural and cruelty-free.
[01:05:56.139 --> 01:05:59.960]  Stay in the game with Emrix Essentials Fragrance-Free Natural Deodorant.
[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:01.841]  Available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:06:19.449 --> 01:06:23.392]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:24.413 --> 01:06:29.157]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:43.528 --> 01:06:44.189]  What a musician.
[01:06:45.953 --> 01:06:49.936]  All right, let's go back to the President giving his live press conference on Iran.
[01:06:50.777 --> 01:06:51.858]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:53.799 --> 01:07:02.146]  And condoned Assad's use of chemical weapons against helpless civilians, including many, many children.
[01:07:03.026 --> 01:07:11.353]  Given the regime's murderous past and present, we should not take lightly its sinister vision for the future.
[01:07:12.776 --> 01:07:20.221]  The regime's two favorite chants are death to America and death to Israel.
[01:07:21.281 --> 01:07:38.912]  Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States and the United Nations Security Council sought, over many years, to stop Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions.
[01:07:40.046 --> 01:07:57.538]  But the previous administration lifted these sanctions just before what would have been the total collapse of the Iranian regime through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.
[01:07:58.498 --> 01:08:05.063]  This deal is known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA.
[01:08:06.488 --> 01:08:16.958]  As I have said many times, the Iran deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.
[01:08:17.999 --> 01:08:28.989]  The same mindset that produced this deal is responsible for years of terrible trade deals that have sacrificed so many millions of jobs
[01:08:29.972 --> 01:08:33.936]  In our country, to the benefit of other countries.
[01:08:34.736 --> 01:08:40.201]  We need negotiators who will much more strongly represent America's interests.
[01:08:41.122 --> 01:08:54.514]  The nuclear deal threw Iran's dictatorship a political and economic lifeline, providing urgently needed relief from the intense domestic pressure the sanctions had created.
[01:08:55.461 --> 01:09:06.664]  It also gave the regime an immediate financial boost, and over $100 billion its government could use to fund terrorism.
[01:09:07.711 --> 01:09:16.136]  The regime also received a massive cash settlement of 1.7 billion dollars from the United States.
[01:09:16.156 --> 01:09:17.096]  That was secret and illegal.
[01:09:17.156 --> 01:09:23.520]  A large portion of which was physically loaded onto an airplane and flown into Iran.
[01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:32.485]  Just imagine the sight of those huge piles of money being hauled off by the Iranians waiting at the airport for the cash.
[01:09:33.366 --> 01:09:35.267]  I wonder where all
[01:09:36.092 --> 01:09:37.633]  That money went.
[01:09:38.953 --> 01:09:44.935]  Worst of all, the deal allows Iran to continue developing certain elements of its nuclear program.
[01:09:45.175 --> 01:09:58.800]  And importantly, in just a few years, as key restrictions disappear, Iran can sprint towards a rapid nuclear weapons breakout.
[01:09:59.764 --> 01:10:12.992]  In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons.
[01:10:13.872 --> 01:10:21.517]  What is the purpose of a deal that, at best, only delays Iran's nuclear capability for a short period of time?
[01:10:22.671 --> 01:10:27.636]  This, as President of the United States, is unacceptable.
[01:10:28.357 --> 01:10:35.624]  In other countries, they think in terms of 100-year intervals, not just a few years at a time.
[01:10:36.245 --> 01:10:42.891]  The saddest part of the deal for the United States is that all of the money was paid up front
[01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:51.626]  Which is unheard of, rather than at the end of the deal, when they have shown they've played by the rules.
[01:10:52.566 --> 01:10:53.027]  Exactly.
[01:10:53.087 --> 01:10:58.471]  What's done is done, and that's why we are where we are.
[01:10:58.491 --> 01:11:01.853]  The best system is a third at the start, a third in the middle, and a third at the end.
[01:11:04.415 --> 01:11:05.196]  of the agreement.
[01:11:05.556 --> 01:11:16.186]  For example, on two separate occasions, they have exceeded the limit of 130 metric tons of heavy water.
[01:11:16.947 --> 01:11:27.276]  Until recently, the Iranian regime has also failed to meet our expectations in its operation of advanced centrifuges.
[01:11:28.237 --> 01:11:39.557]  The Iranian regime has also intimidated international inspectors into not using the full inspection authorities that the agreement calls for.
[01:11:40.754 --> 01:11:56.449]  Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow inspectors onto military sites, even though the international community suspects some of those sites were part of Iran's clandestine nuclear weapons program.
[01:11:57.530 --> 01:12:03.076]  There are also many people who believe that Iran is dealing with North Korea.
[01:12:04.329 --> 01:12:16.212]  I am going to instruct our intelligence agencies to do a thorough analysis and report back their findings beyond what they have already reviewed.
[01:12:17.352 --> 01:12:25.774]  By his own terms, the Iran deal was supposed to contribute to regional and international peace and security.
[01:12:26.812 --> 01:12:40.182]  And yet, while the United States adheres to our commitment under the deal, the Iranian regime continues to fuel conflict, terror, and turmoil throughout the Middle East and beyond.
[01:12:41.123 --> 01:12:47.588]  Importantly, Iran is not living up to the spirit of the deal.
[01:12:48.528 --> 01:12:52.851]  So today, in recognition of the increasing menace posed by Iran,
[01:12:53.812 --> 01:13:04.825]  And after extensive consultations with our allies, I am announcing a new strategy to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions.
[01:13:04.905 --> 01:13:12.354]  First, we will work with our allies to counter the regime's destabilizing activity and support
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:15.620]  For terrorist proxies in the region.
[01:13:16.521 --> 01:13:23.022]  Second, we will place additional sanctions on the regime to block their financing of terror.
[01:13:23.882 --> 01:13:34.004]  Third, we will address the regime's proliferation of missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbors' global trade and freedom of navigation.
[01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:41.785]  And finally, we will deny the regime all paths to a nuclear weapon.
[01:13:43.117 --> 01:13:49.724]  Today I'm also announcing several major steps my administration has taken in pursuit of this strategy.
[01:13:49.804 --> 01:13:52.367]  Iran said if Trump did this, they'd attack us two days ago.
[01:13:52.387 --> 01:14:04.139]  Our strategy begins with the long overdue step of imposing tough sanctions on Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
[01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:13.026]  The Revolutionary Guard is the Iranian Supreme Leader's corrupt personal terror force and militia.
[01:14:13.766 --> 01:14:22.773]  It has hijacked large portions of Iran's economy and seized massive religious endowments to fund war and terror abroad.
[01:14:23.693 --> 01:14:38.940]  This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons to attack civilians in the region, and even plotting to bomb a popular restaurant right here in Washington, D.C.
[01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:40.380]  All right, let's hit pause there.
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:41.861]  We're going to come back with more of this.
[01:14:42.261 --> 01:14:43.541]  Look, I don't like Iran.
[01:14:43.581 --> 01:14:44.442]  I don't like their mullahs.
[01:14:44.842 --> 01:14:51.024]  Their population, 75 or more percent of the polls, some 80-something percent, do not want to be there.
[01:14:51.264 --> 01:14:52.524]  I mean, do not want to be under these mullahs.
[01:14:52.604 --> 01:14:58.346]  It is a dictatorship of the mullahs, and they decide who can run for office and then let you kind of have a sham election.
[01:14:59.086 --> 01:15:00.567]  People go, it's not a dictatorship.
[01:15:00.687 --> 01:15:03.688]  Yeah, it's an Islamic State dictatorship.
[01:15:05.168 --> 01:15:08.410]  Islamic State is a Wahhabist group copying their Shiite enemies.
[01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:09.630]  They want the Islamic State.
[01:15:09.650 --> 01:15:16.514]  But Iran created the Islamic Republic of Iran in 79 with their overthrow of the Shah.
[01:15:17.174 --> 01:15:22.817]  And for all his problems, he was industrializing the country, and women weren't wearing burqas, and it was a pretty nice place to visit.
[01:15:23.537 --> 01:15:27.639]  They did have his savak that were torturing people and things.
[01:15:27.679 --> 01:15:28.300]  It wasn't good.
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:30.561]  They're trying to keep the Islamists under control.
[01:15:32.548 --> 01:15:38.853]  And the whole thing started when the CIA in 53 overthrew Mohamed Mozadek, that was pro-America, but didn't want to be their puppet.
[01:15:39.493 --> 01:15:46.479]  So again, the globalists started the whole thing, and then helped topple the Shah, if you actually research it deeply.
[01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:48.460]  It's just such a mess.
[01:15:48.701 --> 01:15:49.621]  And then now this.
[01:15:50.542 --> 01:15:53.104]  And Iran is belligerent and out of control.
[01:15:53.965 --> 01:15:57.728]  I back the president on so many fronts, but man, I tell you, this is really dangerous.
[01:15:58.068 --> 01:15:58.508]  We'll be back.
[01:15:58.528 --> 01:15:58.869]  Stay with us.
[01:16:02.461 --> 01:16:10.605]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running the biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[01:16:10.865 --> 01:16:14.546]  Now Brain Force Plus, there's 20% more in each bottle.

[01:17:09.606 --> 01:17:12.508]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.

[01:18:36.255 --> 01:18:36.896]  Concentrate.
[01:18:36.916 --> 01:18:38.697]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[01:18:38.958 --> 01:18:40.379]  Next level compared to whey.
[01:18:40.639 --> 01:18:42.241]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[01:18:42.641 --> 01:18:43.522]  It's incredible.
[01:18:44.002 --> 01:18:45.904]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[01:18:46.084 --> 01:18:47.245]  It's bigger than I am already.
[01:18:47.706 --> 01:18:48.606]  At 15, incredible.
[01:18:48.927 --> 01:18:49.807]  It is amazing.
[01:18:50.168 --> 01:18:51.429]  Infowarslife.com.

[01:18:56.133 --> 01:18:58.474]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[01:18:58.914 --> 01:19:04.076]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[01:19:04.496 --> 01:19:05.897]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[01:19:06.137 --> 01:19:07.297]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[01:19:07.677 --> 01:19:08.498]  I want to thank you.

[01:20:05.461 --> 01:20:08.062]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:19.431 --> 01:20:24.902]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[01:20:24.942 --> 01:20:26.044]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:20:26.866 --> 01:20:28.749]  InfoWorth.com, yeah.
[01:20:34.027 --> 01:20:40.253]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:41.234 --> 01:20:44.697]  Look, it is a fact that Iran's working with North Korea on nuclear weapons.
[01:20:44.817 --> 01:20:45.258]  It's a fact.
[01:20:45.278 --> 01:20:50.342]  They're very belligerent and are funding terror attacks in different parts of the world.
[01:20:50.943 --> 01:20:54.786]  But what's really happening here with Trump is an agreement.
[01:20:55.606 --> 01:21:05.511]  It was basically tentatively made between our military five plus years ago and the Russians and the Iranians to not let Al Qaeda take control of Syria.
[01:21:05.531 --> 01:21:06.912]  To shut that down.
[01:21:06.932 --> 01:21:08.753]  Our own military rebelled against Obama.
[01:21:09.353 --> 01:21:10.414]  We told you about it first.
[01:21:10.474 --> 01:21:11.654]  Colonel Schaefer and other guests.
[01:21:12.114 --> 01:21:13.335]  And years later it all came out.
[01:21:15.396 --> 01:21:16.797]  Where else is it going to come out but in full force?
[01:21:17.517 --> 01:21:18.758]  Other people are just too big a coward.
[01:21:18.798 --> 01:21:19.398]  Just like Vegas.
[01:21:19.418 --> 01:21:24.541]  We told you all that was fake and multiple shooters and people shooting inside the hotels and it's all come out.
[01:21:26.817 --> 01:21:28.577]  I've got a whole stack of that I haven't even gotten to yet.
[01:21:30.498 --> 01:21:33.638]  But I'm decisive when something can be decisive.
[01:21:34.238 --> 01:21:39.339]  And I agree the globalists have appeased Iran, and the whole thing's a mess, and they're belligerent and threatening.
[01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:46.520]  But at the same time, are we going to get into a big regional war with Iran now?
[01:21:47.601 --> 01:21:51.581]  And they've got real terror cells that have been brought into this country and Europe.
[01:21:51.661 --> 01:21:54.022]  It's going to be spectacular.
[01:21:55.102 --> 01:21:56.022]  And listen, if folks want
[01:21:57.099 --> 01:21:57.699]  Big wars!
[01:21:58.640 --> 01:21:59.980]  And people like Iran want one.
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:01.801]  I'm not afraid of it.
[01:22:02.381 --> 01:22:04.021]  Not looking for it, but I'm not really worried about it.
[01:22:05.682 --> 01:22:07.162]  It's a miracle we've been here this long.
[01:22:13.805 --> 01:22:19.867]  But I just look at... I know what Trump's doing.
[01:22:20.834 --> 01:22:42.770]  Where we've been maneuvered by the whole Hollywood globalist elite and the big mega bankers that just want to be Hollywood stars, who took control of the global economy and then made themselves Richard and God, basically, but then cut off the economy to make people poor so they could dictate the terms of their surrender, so they could then cuck Christians and people that are the strength of the nation?
[01:22:44.051 --> 01:22:47.914]  I mean, this is just a bunch of really degenerate, neurotic, weird stuff.
[01:22:48.899 --> 01:22:55.422]  Where Hollywood and the globalists want to force us into a bathroom with them, so they can bathe naked in front of us, then come out and rape us.
[01:22:56.282 --> 01:22:57.302]  And that's basically what it is.
[01:22:57.342 --> 01:23:04.825]  They say, your kids belong to us, you belong to us, behave, follow this societal comportment, or we're going to destroy your life.
[01:23:07.046 --> 01:23:08.207]  Because they knew our weakness.
[01:23:08.987 --> 01:23:11.848]  As decent Christian people, we have a moral compass.
[01:23:11.868 --> 01:23:12.308]  We have a
[01:23:14.844 --> 01:23:15.304]  Conscience.
[01:23:16.265 --> 01:23:22.269]  And so they removed the conscience of being good and hard-working and taking care of your children and not lying.
[01:23:25.051 --> 01:23:35.878]  And they replaced it with, oh, you've got to teach five-year-olds that they might not be a boy or a girl and you've got to let other third parties come and sexualize them.
[01:23:36.258 --> 01:23:37.459]  That's your new religion.
[01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:38.620]  And that's all they've done.
[01:23:39.321 --> 01:23:41.222]  They've taken all the uptight
[01:23:44.190 --> 01:23:48.934]  Extremes of Christianity and cults using the Christian faith to control people.
[01:23:49.694 --> 01:23:52.276]  That's what most these churches and movements are.
[01:23:52.777 --> 01:24:01.844]  And they've just flipped it around and boy did we get down in the muck with it and follow it and get into all this self-loathing and all this guilt and just buy into it all.
[01:24:03.965 --> 01:24:08.689]  And then those of us that have consciences become the slaves of people that don't.
[01:24:09.049 --> 01:24:10.490]  And they sit there with their little whip.
[01:24:11.271 --> 01:24:12.272]  Yah, mule, yah!
[01:24:12.612 --> 01:24:13.753]  Keeping us right in line.
[01:24:14.582 --> 01:24:15.162]  Well, not me.
[01:24:16.523 --> 01:24:22.166]  I love God because I know God's real, and I've had spiritual experiences, and I know God's plan.
[01:24:22.207 --> 01:24:25.308]  At least I've seen some of it, and it's beautiful, and I want to be part of it.
[01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:27.850]  But I don't find God in these churches.
[01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:29.591]  My spirit finds the devil.
[01:24:33.753 --> 01:24:38.396]  They told Christ, why are you hanging around with these prostitutes and tax collectors, the most hated people at that time?
[01:24:38.416 --> 01:24:41.278]  And he said, because they don't claim they're good.
[01:24:42.722 --> 01:24:44.583]  They don't claim they've already got it all figured out.
[01:24:45.084 --> 01:24:55.491]  They don't pray up on the hilltop in front of everybody else about how good they are, and then go around and arrest people and shake people down and, you know, have the tax collector do it.
[01:24:56.131 --> 01:24:57.992]  The tax collector actually goes out and does it.
[01:24:58.233 --> 01:24:59.013]  He has to be hated.
[01:24:59.293 --> 01:25:01.595]  What about the people behind that that tell him to go out and do it?
[01:25:04.837 --> 01:25:07.379]  See, I used to attack the TSA all day long.
[01:25:09.175 --> 01:25:18.842]  So I realized, we let Congress do that, Congress did that, they set all that up, they bring the Islamics in, they let them attack, and then they turn around, and then, oh, I'm just gonna blame the TSA people?
[01:25:19.702 --> 01:25:19.922]  No.
[01:25:21.884 --> 01:25:23.245]  I stopped being a hypocrite, I grew up.
[01:25:24.906 --> 01:25:36.093]  And look, I mean, I was always somewhat on target for 20-something years on air, but you really look at the cop-outs in the world, like, I let Congress do that, you let Congress do that.
[01:25:36.534 --> 01:25:38.295]  I'm not gonna sit there at some schlub
[01:25:42.301 --> 01:25:49.983]  Working at the TSA who really thinks he's trying to look for terrorists and sure there's a few perverts and criminals in there as well and it's a bureaucracy and it's bad and I don't like it and I say get rid of it.
[01:25:51.344 --> 01:25:51.924]  But you know what?
[01:25:52.464 --> 01:25:55.125]  You know who really let people sit there and try to grope my children?
[01:25:56.486 --> 01:25:57.846]  It's the public of this country!
[01:25:58.586 --> 01:26:09.950]  The NFL watching, wannabe tough guys that run their mouths all day but wouldn't do anything when it came down to the line they'd turn and they'd run as fast as they could for me to have a real challenge.
[01:26:14.395 --> 01:26:15.036]  Here's the difference.
[01:26:15.196 --> 01:26:15.796]  I'm not running.
[01:26:17.177 --> 01:26:18.078]  You know what I'm scared of?
[01:26:18.118 --> 01:26:18.878]  I'm scared of running.
[01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:22.460]  I'm scared of being a coward.
[01:26:24.962 --> 01:26:27.044]  Only thing that feels good is going straight up against this thing.
[01:26:29.665 --> 01:26:32.947]  And that's why the globalists hate us so much, because they know they can't scare us.
[01:26:34.909 --> 01:26:37.030]  Because I'm already scared of separation from God.
[01:26:38.351 --> 01:26:40.372]  I've already tied into that energy.
[01:26:41.353 --> 01:26:43.735]  I've already dialed into it, and it's so good.
[01:26:45.299 --> 01:26:47.882]  That I'm actually ashamed at how fearless I am.
[01:26:47.902 --> 01:26:50.846]  Because I should worry about myself and my family.
[01:26:50.866 --> 01:26:57.213]  And it's not some wanton thing or some negligent thing where I threw the fear aside.
[01:26:57.233 --> 01:27:00.277]  But still there's shadows and echoes of that.
[01:27:00.297 --> 01:27:02.559]  And I'm all in everything.
[01:27:03.442 --> 01:27:05.663]  My family, my name, my treasure, my blood.
[01:27:05.983 --> 01:27:06.403]  I'm ready.
[01:27:06.443 --> 01:27:07.023]  It's all in.
[01:27:07.403 --> 01:27:12.965]  Let me tell you, making that decision at a spiritual level is like coming out of Egypt.
[01:27:13.025 --> 01:27:14.205]  It's like coming out of Babylon.
[01:27:14.625 --> 01:27:19.927]  The minute you decide to be all in is the minute you start living.
[01:27:22.328 --> 01:27:25.749]  And then you start knowing that this is all just a test.
[01:27:25.769 --> 01:27:26.889]  You don't want to commit suicide.
[01:27:26.909 --> 01:27:27.649]  You don't want to die.
[01:27:28.329 --> 01:27:29.690]  But you're not afraid anymore.
[01:27:29.930 --> 01:27:30.010]  And
[01:27:33.985 --> 01:27:35.245]  You realize God's holding your hand.
[01:27:39.526 --> 01:27:40.986]  So you want to stay here for your family.
[01:27:44.247 --> 01:27:45.567]  And stay here to take on the enemy.
[01:27:47.608 --> 01:27:48.588]  But you want to be with God.
[01:27:51.188 --> 01:27:56.489]  The only thing that matters in this universe is that when you get buried six feet under, you're with God.
[01:27:58.210 --> 01:28:00.130]  Because God is all about free will.
[01:28:07.857 --> 01:28:09.437]  He's not going to be there if you don't want him to be.
[01:28:12.719 --> 01:28:22.503]  That, my friends, is what separates us, is that choice.
[01:28:23.724 --> 01:28:26.585]  People that are so insecure, that are so weak.
[01:28:29.161 --> 01:28:32.704]  That they would, out of fear, give in to this spirit.
[01:28:33.905 --> 01:28:38.389]  Believing it would deal with them easier if they rolled over to it.
[01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:41.812]  Rolling over only presents your belly to the wolf.
[01:28:43.314 --> 01:28:50.901]  If the wolf's gonna come, even if he's successful defeating me, he's gonna choke on my flesh.
[01:28:51.901 --> 01:28:53.383]  May the wolf choke on my flesh.
[01:28:55.762 --> 01:28:57.025]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[01:28:57.045 --> 01:28:59.430]  I'll finish up with Trump, get into the big news I haven't hit yet.
[01:28:59.911 --> 01:29:00.894]  Infowars.com.
[01:29:02.638 --> 01:29:04.181]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running...
[01:29:05.447 --> 01:29:10.771]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[01:29:11.031 --> 01:29:12.152]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[01:29:12.412 --> 01:29:14.714]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[01:29:15.394 --> 01:29:21.899]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[01:29:22.099 --> 01:29:25.441]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[01:29:25.741 --> 01:29:27.563]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[01:29:28.203 --> 01:29:36.607]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[01:29:36.628 --> 01:29:37.608]  They know how great it is.
[01:29:38.508 --> 01:29:42.310]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[01:29:42.331 --> 01:29:44.632]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[01:29:45.412 --> 01:29:53.276]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then Brain Force is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[01:29:53.716 --> 01:29:56.278]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:29:56.818 --> 01:30:02.185]  Brain Force Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[01:30:02.746 --> 01:30:05.169]  That comes to $50.03.
[01:30:05.309 --> 01:30:09.354]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[01:30:09.775 --> 01:30:12.678]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[01:30:15.061 --> 01:30:15.941]  It's a good deal at $39.

[01:31:02.792 --> 01:31:20.588]  I want to just briefly thank listeners for their support of the broadcast and remind listeners that we are listener supported and it is your financial support getting good products in return that you need and that symbiotic relationship and that 360 win that makes everything here we do possible.
[01:31:21.309 --> 01:31:26.637]  And we're not just going to have to end the next week the Brain Force Plus special 50% off.
[01:31:26.997 --> 01:31:35.870]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our caveman ultimate paleo bone broth, turmeric, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, and more.
[01:31:36.411 --> 01:31:37.052]  Concentrate.
[01:31:37.072 --> 01:31:38.874]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[01:31:39.134 --> 01:31:40.536]  Next level compared to whey.
[01:31:40.556 --> 01:31:42.398]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[01:31:42.819 --> 01:31:43.700]  It's incredible.
[01:31:44.161 --> 01:31:46.083]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[01:31:46.263 --> 01:31:47.405]  It's bigger than I am already.
[01:31:47.865 --> 01:31:48.766]  At 15, incredible.
[01:31:49.087 --> 01:31:49.988]  It is amazing.
[01:31:50.328 --> 01:31:51.610]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:31:52.050 --> 01:31:53.172]  50% off Caveman.
[01:31:53.392 --> 01:31:54.733]  But only a few days left.
[01:31:54.974 --> 01:31:55.715]  It's about to end.
[01:31:56.295 --> 01:31:58.637]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[01:31:59.077 --> 01:32:04.241]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[01:32:04.661 --> 01:32:06.062]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[01:32:06.322 --> 01:32:07.463]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.

[01:33:05.963 --> 01:33:08.585]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:14.298 --> 01:33:18.180]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:33:19.841 --> 01:33:22.683]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:25.844 --> 01:33:39.772]  I was up in Canada, covering Bilderberg, and a distinguished gentleman with a British accent walked over and he said, I'm a mathematician, Mr. Jones, and have you ever thought of the equation, politically but also mathematically, that the answer to 1984 is 1776?
[01:33:44.969 --> 01:33:47.030]  And I said, no, but I'm going to go say that and I bullhorned it.
[01:33:48.171 --> 01:33:49.171]  He died like a year later.
[01:33:49.191 --> 01:33:58.557]  And then when I looked the guy up, he was like the former top economist in the British government for multiple prime ministers.
[01:34:02.078 --> 01:34:05.320]  And like later, he's with me and Tucker at dinner and we're like, ah, drinking beer.
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:07.441]  And he's a bigger drunk than I was.
[01:34:07.481 --> 01:34:11.964]  The point was, is that it's just, it's just these cool people, man.
[01:34:11.984 --> 01:34:13.865]  And they're just gone like that.
[01:34:16.749 --> 01:34:18.070]  But that's not just an animal.
[01:34:18.130 --> 01:34:19.731]  That's not just a machine.
[01:34:19.791 --> 01:34:20.751]  That's a spirit.
[01:34:21.832 --> 01:34:22.572]  That's a person.
[01:34:22.592 --> 01:34:26.855]  And everything these people that don't have spirit do is try to steal ours.
[01:34:27.635 --> 01:34:29.476]  Because people want what they don't have.
[01:34:30.277 --> 01:34:36.680]  And that's all you need to know about Hollywood and all these people if you want to know why they fear InfoWars.
[01:34:37.821 --> 01:34:41.743]  Because knowing that, I'll play this clip from yesterday here in a moment and finish up with President Trump.
[01:34:41.803 --> 01:34:42.564]  If you want to know why,
[01:34:44.377 --> 01:34:45.258]  Well, let's look at what we're doing.
[01:34:45.858 --> 01:34:48.900]  If you want to know how to defeat them, what is it?
[01:34:49.020 --> 01:34:50.280]  Just being genuine.
[01:34:51.461 --> 01:34:52.082]  Being real.
[01:34:53.022 --> 01:34:54.203]  And swinging for the fences.
[01:34:56.064 --> 01:35:00.386]  And not being affected by what other people think about you.
[01:35:00.887 --> 01:35:02.027]  Because you have an inner compass.
[01:35:04.089 --> 01:35:04.869]  It's transcendent.
[01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:06.250]  And so,
[01:35:10.037 --> 01:35:18.941]  When I see Google and Facebook and Twitter really curtailing us, really blocking us, really putting the screws to everything, I knew that was coming a long time ago.
[01:35:18.961 --> 01:35:23.603]  That's why we built NewsWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[01:35:23.623 --> 01:35:31.726]  That's why we launched radio syndication and TV syndication and why we've tried all the things we've done and had some success because of you spreading the word.
[01:35:31.766 --> 01:35:35.208]  I mean, you are the oxygen in the room, listeners.
[01:35:36.653 --> 01:35:40.397]  And I know you know that, but don't think it's like Alex Jones is up here.
[01:35:41.157 --> 01:35:42.339]  Alex Jones is right here.
[01:35:42.379 --> 01:35:43.119]  We're in the room together.
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:44.601]  I'm with you right now.
[01:35:44.661 --> 01:35:45.141]  You're with me.
[01:35:46.463 --> 01:35:47.484]  We don't like pedophiles.
[01:35:47.544 --> 01:35:48.585]  We don't like devil worshippers.
[01:35:48.625 --> 01:35:49.466]  We don't like cheats.
[01:35:49.526 --> 01:35:54.531]  We don't like folks that trip, you know, handicapped kids when they're walking down the hall.
[01:35:58.789 --> 01:36:00.270]  Oh, we like to hurt bad people.
[01:36:00.290 --> 01:36:01.571]  And let's just be honest about that.
[01:36:02.071 --> 01:36:03.912]  And that's something we got to control so we don't become them.
[01:36:03.932 --> 01:36:06.334]  Does that come around the other way?
[01:36:06.394 --> 01:36:08.595]  But you know, I just say that because I know your heart.
[01:36:09.216 --> 01:36:09.896]  I know who you are.
[01:36:11.938 --> 01:36:17.041]  And you've already got so much strength, you don't need to go out and dominate to prove you've got it.
[01:36:21.513 --> 01:36:23.194]  The globalists know you have that strength.
[01:36:24.175 --> 01:36:24.955]  And they don't like it.
[01:36:25.716 --> 01:36:26.996]  Even if you don't have the office.
[01:36:27.797 --> 01:36:29.358]  Even if you aren't in the power structure.
[01:36:29.918 --> 01:36:31.839]  They know you have the birthright.
[01:36:31.859 --> 01:36:37.783]  No matter what color your skin is, if your heart's pointed towards God, you have the birthright.
[01:36:38.643 --> 01:36:39.724]  The enemy knows it.
[01:36:42.246 --> 01:36:43.847]  The enemy ever feels it.
[01:36:45.103 --> 01:36:53.389]  The enemy's fallen, and the enemy says, if I could just have control, if I could just bring them down, then I would be the most high.
[01:36:56.711 --> 01:37:00.134]  When if you had discernment, wicked ones, you'd know you are not the most high.
[01:37:00.394 --> 01:37:06.699]  You're built to be a receiver, and then a sub-creator in God's system.
[01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:10.241]  You're a spark from God's mind.
[01:37:10.281 --> 01:37:11.042]  You are not God.
[01:37:12.284 --> 01:37:34.186]  You are the space-time continuum fount, the product of the progeneration, and in that you are timeless and complete and great and with God, but the attempt to claim that that which comes out of the mouth of the river is the river is a lie!
[01:37:38.029 --> 01:37:42.190]  You're like a tree that grew by the side of the river, grew old and fell over into the river.
[01:37:43.411 --> 01:37:44.531]  But you are not the river.
[01:37:48.573 --> 01:37:51.974]  And those that choose to be cut off from God achieve oblivion.
[01:38:00.717 --> 01:38:04.158]  When left-wing politics become a substitute for religion, that's all it is.
[01:38:05.338 --> 01:38:06.799]  It's archetypal memories.
[01:38:06.859 --> 01:38:07.499]  It's race memory.
[01:38:08.772 --> 01:38:19.218]  I talked to so many leftists and most of them had grandparents or parents that were super religious, made them sit in church constantly, were super neurotic about everything, and then now they've just passed it on to the other thing.
[01:38:20.099 --> 01:38:20.799]  That's what they've done.
[01:38:21.119 --> 01:38:30.885]  But since I mentioned it, here is part of the interview yesterday, it was a lot of it, with Project Veritas founder James O'Keefe, about the latest videos.
[01:38:31.866 --> 01:38:37.169]  Who does the Google, YouTube, New York Times liaison, who are they bragging?
[01:38:38.459 --> 01:38:39.560]  That they're there to shut down.
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:40.641]  It's us.
[01:38:41.441 --> 01:38:44.364]  And when I tell you that, it's not like, oh look, I'm leading the race.
[01:38:44.404 --> 01:38:46.045]  It's like, I'm under fire.
[01:38:46.065 --> 01:38:48.967]  And I don't say that whining.
[01:38:48.987 --> 01:38:50.448]  It's like, we found the enemy.
[01:38:50.468 --> 01:38:51.449]  They're attacking us here.
[01:38:51.489 --> 01:38:52.270]  We found their weak point.
[01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:53.190]  But we're under attack.
[01:38:53.210 --> 01:38:53.671]  We need help.
[01:38:56.873 --> 01:38:57.373]  That's what this is.
[01:39:00.656 --> 01:39:05.339]  That's why other media is amazed that I promote WorldNetDaily and Breitbart and everybody else.
[01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:07.101]  Why wouldn't I?
[01:39:08.857 --> 01:39:09.417]  It's dark.
[01:39:09.457 --> 01:39:10.158]  We're in a war.
[01:39:10.258 --> 01:39:11.038]  We're fighting evil.
[01:39:11.098 --> 01:39:12.339]  I mean, I want more people.
[01:39:12.479 --> 01:39:16.021]  I want to be obsolete so bad it makes my head spin.
[01:39:16.081 --> 01:39:19.883]  I don't want to feel that drive to have to come in every day and fight them as hard as I do.
[01:39:22.124 --> 01:39:24.345]  I'm guilty for not spending more time with my family.
[01:39:24.365 --> 01:39:29.708]  And I only talk about this to give an example of we're not competing with each other.
[01:39:30.008 --> 01:39:36.992]  We're in a war against very evil people that want to hurt us.
[01:39:38.925 --> 01:39:42.428]  And the minute we finally break with them, they have no more power, and that's all I want to see.
[01:39:42.628 --> 01:39:43.809]  And I see it starting to happen.
[01:39:44.770 --> 01:39:47.112]  I see this big vampire squid being pulled off our face.
[01:39:47.492 --> 01:39:49.374]  We got wounds, and we're hurt, but we're going to survive.
[01:39:49.834 --> 01:39:52.457]  And I just want to make sure we don't give up or kind of hesitate.
[01:39:52.497 --> 01:39:55.660]  It gets back ahold of us again, because we might not get it off of us again.
[01:39:57.501 --> 01:39:58.602]  We've got it off our face.
[01:39:58.822 --> 01:39:59.563]  Now it's on our arm.
[01:39:59.603 --> 01:40:02.726]  It's tearing the flesh off our bones.
[01:40:04.545 --> 01:40:07.987]  It's chewing our arm up right in front of us, but here's the thing about spiritual will.
[01:40:08.628 --> 01:40:09.929]  We will grow that arm back.
[01:40:10.029 --> 01:40:18.194]  You cannot let that freak you out as it tears your arm off, as it climbs on your face and bites your eyeballs out, because through Christ we rise again.
[01:40:18.214 --> 01:40:22.477]  Through our children we rise again.
[01:40:23.318 --> 01:40:26.760]  As long as the devil can't destroy the planet and the species, he fails.
[01:40:27.581 --> 01:40:30.503]  And that is the great contest in the future to win.
[01:40:31.388 --> 01:40:38.633]  I always play part of James O'Keefe to remember the enemy in their councils fears you, the audience of this broadcast.
[01:40:40.305 --> 01:40:41.665]  Every time I go on your show, I say this.
[01:40:42.165 --> 01:40:44.346]  We confirm suspicions at Veritas.
[01:40:44.386 --> 01:40:50.588]  It's not a shock to you, but to get the employee at YouTube on tape admitting that they do it?
[01:40:51.008 --> 01:40:53.709]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[01:40:54.149 --> 01:40:55.709]  They didn't call out Fox News by name.
[01:40:55.749 --> 01:40:57.570]  They didn't call out anyone else by name.
[01:40:57.610 --> 01:41:03.251]  They said, when it comes to Alex Jones, we need people to scroll and manually find him
[01:41:03.351 --> 01:41:04.391]  We're good to go.
[01:41:33.217 --> 01:41:33.838]  Working with.
[01:41:49.496 --> 01:41:56.403]  This shelf of videos from news partners is legitimate news because they know that these are legitimate news organizations.
[01:41:57.244 --> 01:42:04.753]  And if at that point somebody decides they're going to scroll past that and go find Alex Jones, well, they were looking for him to begin with anyway.
[01:42:05.434 --> 01:42:08.617]  I understand you're looking at a slave in that video.
[01:42:09.594 --> 01:42:14.918]  I mean, this person is domesticated, they're warped, they can hardly talk.
[01:42:15.078 --> 01:42:17.240]  This is who the enemy has against us.
[01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:21.042]  And if we let people like that dominate us, we deserve what we get.
[01:42:22.005 --> 01:42:23.826]  But we know what we're up against.
[01:42:23.846 --> 01:42:29.971]  Alright, I'm gonna come back, finish up with Trump, and then I've got this big news story about Kit Daniels that's up on Infowars.com.
[01:42:30.332 --> 01:42:38.478]  And I know you know this, but it's important to ding-dong, the witch is dead, the witch-o-witch, the witch-witch-witch, ding-dong, the wicked witch is dead, and all her flying monkeys.
[01:42:38.979 --> 01:42:43.502]  Hollywood will implode, Spielberg said in 2013.
[01:42:44.783 --> 01:42:47.966]  Yes, it's all imploding, but they're gonna counter-strike, so be ready.
[01:42:48.006 --> 01:42:48.907]  This is the critical time.
[01:42:50.648 --> 01:42:51.589]  You have to ask yourselves,
[01:42:52.691 --> 01:42:54.173]  What is it they fear about InfoWars?
[01:42:55.574 --> 01:42:56.415]  It's the spirit.
[01:42:57.596 --> 01:42:58.818]  It's a spiritual war.
[01:43:02.882 --> 01:43:04.424]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running...
[01:43:05.683 --> 01:43:11.007]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[01:43:11.287 --> 01:43:12.408]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[01:43:12.668 --> 01:43:14.970]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[01:43:15.630 --> 01:43:22.135]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[01:43:22.355 --> 01:43:25.317]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[01:43:25.997 --> 01:43:27.799]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[01:43:28.439 --> 01:43:36.869]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[01:43:36.889 --> 01:43:37.850]  They know how great it is.
[01:43:38.771 --> 01:43:42.515]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[01:43:43.456 --> 01:43:44.858]  Tropic means for the brain.
[01:43:45.659 --> 01:43:53.527]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[01:43:53.968 --> 01:43:59.774]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:05.420]  That comes to $50.03.
[01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:09.583]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[01:44:10.003 --> 01:44:13.145]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[01:44:13.185 --> 01:44:14.146]  It's a good deal at $39.
[01:44:15.326 --> 01:44:16.047]  It's $19.96 at Infowarslife.com.
[01:44:22.631 --> 01:44:27.516]  Or simply call toll-free, 888-253-3139.

[01:45:27.262 --> 01:45:34.671]  I'm gonna have to end even sooner our caveman ultimate paleo bone broth turmeric chaga mushroom bee pollen.
[01:45:35.709 --> 01:45:36.169]  And more.
[01:45:36.670 --> 01:45:37.310]  Concentrate.
[01:45:37.330 --> 01:45:39.111]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[01:45:39.372 --> 01:45:40.813]  Next level compared to whey.
[01:45:41.033 --> 01:45:42.654]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[01:45:43.074 --> 01:45:43.935]  It's incredible.
[01:45:44.415 --> 01:45:46.316]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[01:45:46.516 --> 01:45:47.657]  It's bigger than I am already.
[01:45:48.117 --> 01:45:49.018]  At 15, incredible.
[01:45:49.338 --> 01:45:50.219]  It is amazing.
[01:45:50.579 --> 01:45:51.860]  Infowarslife.com.

[01:45:56.543 --> 01:45:58.904]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[01:45:59.324 --> 01:46:04.487]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[01:46:04.907 --> 01:46:06.308]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[01:46:06.568 --> 01:46:07.729]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[01:46:08.109 --> 01:46:08.909]  I want to thank you.
[01:46:09.249 --> 01:46:10.290]  We're all in this together.

[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:36.848]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer Brain Force at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.

[01:47:05.864 --> 01:47:08.505]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:23.556 --> 01:47:25.676]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:47:26.157 --> 01:47:31.418]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:47:32.678 --> 01:47:35.419]  It's Friday the 13th.
[01:47:52.332 --> 01:47:55.573]  Black gon' turn to red.
[01:47:55.593 --> 01:47:56.173]  That's right.
[01:47:56.193 --> 01:48:01.375]  Do the globalists really want to have a bloody bloodletting?
[01:48:01.455 --> 01:48:06.256]  I think everybody deserves a little pain.
[01:48:23.723 --> 01:48:25.024]  So they want to get into that arena.
[01:48:26.264 --> 01:48:29.105]  Not just one where it's in the movies, but one where it's for real.
[01:48:29.125 --> 01:48:32.026]  A lot of people want to get into that arena with them.
[01:48:34.167 --> 01:48:35.487]  Now there is that civil war.
[01:48:38.569 --> 01:48:43.950]  Santa Claus has been making a list and checking it twice.
[01:48:43.991 --> 01:48:47.712]  And that's why the wicked flee when none pursue.
[01:48:53.021 --> 01:48:56.023]  I want to play some reports, because they get me these amazing video clips.
[01:48:56.624 --> 01:49:13.135]  Trump gave a speech yesterday, I kind of got stuck on this whole Iran thing, announcing all these new sanctions and the rest of it, where he said the American founders invoked our Creator, but how many times, but how many times have changed?
[01:49:14.096 --> 01:49:17.458]  Again, the American founders invoked our Creator, but how many times has it changed?
[01:49:17.478 --> 01:49:18.379]  That was this morning, actually.
[01:49:19.119 --> 01:49:21.081]  We know parents,
[01:49:22.352 --> 01:49:24.912]  Not bureaucrats know best how to raise their children.
[01:49:25.473 --> 01:49:35.594]  See, he's coming and countering the very poison they've injected to make common sense bad, to destabilize everything and make you give up hope.
[01:49:36.775 --> 01:49:38.295]  They've been demoralizing you.
[01:49:38.335 --> 01:49:39.535]  That's a military tactic.
[01:49:41.055 --> 01:49:45.676]  So he said, the American founders invoked our Creator, but how times have changed.
[01:49:47.097 --> 01:49:47.697]  But you know what?
[01:49:48.217 --> 01:49:49.177]  They're changing again.
[01:49:51.257 --> 01:49:55.680]  We know that parents, not bureaucrats, know best how to raise their children.
[01:49:56.681 --> 01:50:02.005]  As long as we have pride in our country, confidence in our future, and faith in our God, then America will prevail.
[01:50:03.306 --> 01:50:08.891]  The last ten months we've found, and have followed through, on one promise after another.
[01:50:09.111 --> 01:50:09.751]  All this is true.
[01:50:10.372 --> 01:50:11.032]  And a bunch of others.
[01:50:11.052 --> 01:50:13.694]  I'm going to play that after our guest.
[01:50:14.946 --> 01:50:23.491]  Former Trump campaign operative, high level, Michael Caputo joins us to get into the total culture war we're under, and Mike Cernovich is scheduled to host the fourth hour.
[01:50:23.511 --> 01:50:26.973]  But I got a bunch of other clips I want to get to.
[01:50:27.533 --> 01:50:28.434]  Paul Watson did one.
[01:50:28.494 --> 01:50:29.654]  Eminem's a complete idiot.
[01:50:30.435 --> 01:50:35.738]  And it's not about... Eminem's so pathetic and so cringeworthy that I couldn't cover him three days ago.
[01:50:37.594 --> 01:50:44.915]  But then watching everybody else turn against him, it was just so good to see people rejecting some fake wannabe tough guy thug.
[01:50:44.936 --> 01:50:50.997]  And just all the ridiculousness that he's involved in.
[01:50:51.017 --> 01:50:56.778]  Trying to act like a big tough man to young men that never had a daddy in their lives.
[01:51:01.279 --> 01:51:01.879]  So we're gonna be
[01:51:03.766 --> 01:51:04.908]  Playing that here in just a moment.
[01:51:04.928 --> 01:51:06.492]  Just briefly because they're telling me to and it's true.
[01:51:06.512 --> 01:51:07.955]  I need to find her operation.
[01:51:08.215 --> 01:51:09.338]  When I plug, we're in the black.
[01:51:09.378 --> 01:51:10.300]  When I don't, we're in the red.
[01:51:12.011 --> 01:51:20.853]  We got nutraceuticals and supplements that are super popular because they're private label top names discounted or they're proprietary such as we develop with top organic producers in the country.
[01:51:21.193 --> 01:51:27.414]  Brain Force, leading competitors are $70 at the high end, $40 at the low end to get something similar.
[01:51:27.874 --> 01:51:29.314]  Well, it's a good deal normally at $29.95.
[01:51:29.615 --> 01:51:30.155]  It's $19.95.
[01:51:30.195 --> 01:51:31.735]  Sometimes the full retail is $39.95.
[01:51:31.775 --> 01:51:32.515]  20% more in each bottle.
[01:51:37.296 --> 01:51:39.698]  It's available, but I thought we could run this for weeks and weeks.
[01:51:39.738 --> 01:51:41.759]  We are selling so much at this discounted price.
[01:51:42.140 --> 01:51:43.300]  Never done 50% before.
[01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:46.102]  I'm going to have to stop this special the next week.
[01:51:46.743 --> 01:51:48.424]  Caveman's got to end the next few days.
[01:51:48.784 --> 01:51:50.265]  The bone broth formula, amazing.
[01:51:50.305 --> 01:51:54.288]  The turmeric, the shiitake mushroom, the bee pollen, and was it four or five other superfoods?
[01:51:54.388 --> 01:51:55.369]  It's just, there's nothing like it.
[01:51:55.629 --> 01:51:57.330]  It's the next level of whey, basically.
[01:51:57.591 --> 01:52:00.213]  You think whey does good stuff for your joints, your body, your strength, your stamina?
[01:52:00.593 --> 01:52:03.215]  Try organic, concentrated, fresh bone broth.
[01:52:03.755 --> 01:52:23.024]  We're talking like, we can't do the equation because they don't know how to do it, but we're talking, it's like mother's chicken noodle soup squared, and in my opinion it tastes good with some milk and ice ground up in a deal, but I kind of like the kind of beefy beef, it's like steak meets chocolate.
[01:52:24.213 --> 01:52:26.433]  Strawberry is kind of like strawberry.
[01:52:26.453 --> 01:52:27.354]  I don't know.
[01:52:27.374 --> 01:52:29.214]  The point is you don't do it for the taste, but I think it tastes good.
[01:52:29.614 --> 01:52:32.455]  Infowarslive.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:52:32.515 --> 01:52:34.915]  A bunch of other specials are ending as well.
[01:52:34.975 --> 01:52:35.955]  Be sure and check those out.
[01:52:35.995 --> 01:52:38.276]  And you get free shipping when you sign up.
[01:52:38.336 --> 01:52:40.676]  Well, you get auto-ship 10% off.
[01:52:40.696 --> 01:52:41.857]  $50 or more is free shipping.
[01:52:41.877 --> 01:52:42.837]  So thank you all for your support.
[01:52:42.857 --> 01:52:46.658]  Please commit to do that if you believe in what we're doing and want to see it expand.
[01:52:47.438 --> 01:52:47.838]  This is all.
[01:52:47.938 --> 01:52:48.658]  You are the will.
[01:52:49.218 --> 01:52:56.822]  The audience of InfoWars is not the resistance, it is the resistance, but it's the will, the heart, the blood, the brain, the guts, the bone, the fist.
[01:52:57.842 --> 01:52:58.222]  The will.
[01:52:58.242 --> 01:52:59.143]  I mean, you're it!
[01:53:00.483 --> 01:53:01.044]  And you know that.
[01:53:02.464 --> 01:53:05.206]  And I don't even feel worthy to be here before you.
[01:53:05.346 --> 01:53:08.487]  Alright, we won't get to the whole thing, but here's part of Paul Watson's powerful report.
[01:53:09.288 --> 01:53:10.628]  It's only got a couple million views.
[01:53:10.648 --> 01:53:13.009]  I mean, Millie Weaver's video is young, it's got three million in it.
[01:53:13.029 --> 01:53:14.930]  I mean, it's fifty million, but they're blocking it.
[01:53:15.010 --> 01:53:16.471]  You know, we're public enemy number one.
[01:53:16.491 --> 01:53:18.412]  I mean, they know when they don't block it, it gets a hundred million.
[01:53:19.878 --> 01:53:26.366]  So they just delete those videos where you have 100 million, 45 million views because, you know, that's just one version of Paul's on Facebook.
[01:53:26.406 --> 01:53:27.187]  It's got like 3 million.
[01:53:27.868 --> 01:53:28.769]  Eminem is a complete idiot.
[01:53:28.809 --> 01:53:30.732]  Here's a part of Paul Joseph Watson's report.
[01:53:31.012 --> 01:53:31.813]  They don't want you to see.
[01:53:31.853 --> 01:53:32.174]  Here it is.
[01:53:38.140 --> 01:53:48.925]  Now that rapping about murdering his girlfriend and calling people fags doesn't sell as many records, Eminem has devised a fresh, original, truly original way to resonate with his audience.
[01:53:49.025 --> 01:53:51.066]  Call Donald Trump a racist!
[01:53:51.306 --> 01:53:54.307]  Racism's the only thing he's fantastic for!
[01:53:54.467 --> 01:53:55.588]  So edgy!
[01:53:55.808 --> 01:53:58.909]  Literally no other celebrity has said that about Trump.
[01:53:59.069 --> 01:54:02.611]  Trump, the same guy that the hip-hop community adored for decades.
[01:54:02.771 --> 01:54:04.132]  Oh, don't take my word for it.
[01:54:04.192 --> 01:54:11.358]  Here's the Huffington Post explaining how, before 2015, Trump was praised in no less than 67 major hip-hop songs.
[01:54:11.498 --> 01:54:13.340]  Rappers love Donald Trump.
[01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:36.203]  But as soon as Trump started taking on the Democratic establishment, he suddenly became a racist and rappers started attacking him.
[01:54:36.304 --> 01:54:38.544]  Isn't that an amazing coincidence?
[01:54:38.664 --> 01:54:40.685]  But wait, let's give Eminem a chance.
[01:54:40.765 --> 01:54:42.106]  He's a great lyricist.
[01:54:42.206 --> 01:54:46.387]  Surely he's gonna bring something new, something different, something captivating.
[01:54:46.447 --> 01:54:49.048]  Surely he's not just gonna call Donald Trump orange.
[01:54:49.068 --> 01:54:49.869]  And he's orange.
[01:54:50.129 --> 01:54:50.749]  Orange.
[01:54:54.727 --> 01:54:56.768]  It's racist 94-year-old grandpa!
[01:54:56.788 --> 01:55:03.130]  Yeah, maybe you should check into Trump's racist past, Marshall, because he probably hung around with even more black people than you did.
[01:55:03.170 --> 01:55:05.271]  The Clintons destroyed black families.
[01:55:05.411 --> 01:55:06.411]  Super predators.
[01:55:06.451 --> 01:55:11.993]  While Trump at least has a plan to rebuild the inner cities, including your hometown of Detroit.
[01:55:12.053 --> 01:55:13.574]  No, but Trump's the racist.
[01:55:13.654 --> 01:55:21.017]  But we better give Obama props, because what we got in office now's a kamikaze that'll probably cause a nuclear holocaust.
[01:55:21.057 --> 01:55:24.038]  No, Marshall, the person who wanted a nuclear holocaust
[01:55:24.198 --> 01:55:25.359]  Was Hillary Clinton.
[01:55:25.399 --> 01:55:28.762]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[01:55:28.782 --> 01:55:34.107]  You know, the person you cussed out 18 years ago when you were actually relevant.
[01:55:34.127 --> 01:55:37.771]  You know, the 90s, when you were somewhat counterculture.
[01:55:37.871 --> 01:55:42.995]  Unlike now, when you couldn't have your tongue more firmly jammed up the ass of the establishment.
[01:55:43.135 --> 01:55:45.718]  Oh, I'm sorry, Eminem's leading the resistance.
[01:55:45.818 --> 01:55:47.039]  That's why every corporate
[01:55:47.059 --> 01:55:50.424]  That media outlet is creaming their pants over his tantrum.
[01:55:50.484 --> 01:55:52.287]  What exactly are you resisting?
[01:55:52.507 --> 01:55:54.790]  The Democratic establishment hates Trump.
[01:55:54.890 --> 01:55:57.013]  The Republican establishment hates Trump.
[01:55:57.254 --> 01:55:58.716]  The media hates Trump.
[01:55:59.036 --> 01:56:00.579]  Academia hates Trump.
[01:56:00.799 --> 01:56:02.181]  Hollywood hates Trump.
[01:56:02.381 --> 01:56:03.403]  The TV industry...
[01:56:03.743 --> 01:56:04.343]  Hey, it's Trump.
[01:56:04.563 --> 01:56:13.027]  Oh, but you're so controversial for pushing the very same talking points that they do and then being rewarded for it by those very same industries.
[01:56:13.207 --> 01:56:14.348]  So brave!
[01:56:14.468 --> 01:56:18.889]  You can't be the dominant culture and the counterculture at the same time.
[01:56:18.929 --> 01:56:20.230]  That's not how it works.
[01:56:20.370 --> 01:56:22.431]  And you want to give Obama prop.
[01:56:22.651 --> 01:56:23.832]  We better give Obama props!
[01:56:23.872 --> 01:56:29.718]  Yeah, where was your anti-war rage when Obama was simultaneously bombing seven different countries?
[01:56:29.798 --> 01:56:33.942]  I guess criticizing a black president just doesn't make commercial sense, does it?
[01:56:33.982 --> 01:56:39.347]  But I'm sure that Eminem's rage is all spontaneous, heartfelt, and genuine.
[01:56:39.487 --> 01:56:43.431]  I'm sure it has nothing whatsoever to do with him having a record coming out soon.
[01:56:43.491 --> 01:56:47.255]  I mean, it's not like he's literally got a new album coming out next month, is it?
[01:56:47.575 --> 01:56:48.816]  Oh, look, he does!
[01:56:48.836 --> 01:56:50.158]  Well, imagine my shock.
[01:56:50.538 --> 01:56:51.860]  Eminem, you're not edgy.
[01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:53.221]  You're not counterculture.
[01:56:53.321 --> 01:56:57.525]  You're a 44-year-old has-been who's completely run out of creative ideas.
[01:56:57.626 --> 01:57:09.518]  Your recent albums were panned by the critics, so now you're trying to ingratiate yourself by glomming onto the fake anti-Trump resistance by resorting to the most cringe-worthy, unoriginal, boring,
[01:57:10.420 --> 01:57:18.919]  We're going to come back in the next little segment and play more of this and I didn't get into Kit Daniel's article that's so important where Steven Spielberg three years ago said Hollywood's going to implode.
[01:57:20.074 --> 01:57:21.855]  Financially, culturally, everything.
[01:57:21.895 --> 01:57:30.220]  And again, these are America-hating, globalist, unhappy scum that literally want to dominate you and your family.
[01:57:30.780 --> 01:57:37.004]  I mean, that's their whole thing in life is to make, you know, beautiful women watch big fat ugly guys bathe and then have sex with them.
[01:57:37.304 --> 01:57:39.085]  I mean, imagine, it gets far worse than that.
[01:57:39.465 --> 01:57:45.309]  They want to make you literally sit there and be a toilet bowl for them to sit on.
[01:57:45.589 --> 01:57:49.432]  It's not happening, scum, and I love watching all you pieces of garbage fall.
[01:57:49.672 --> 01:57:50.292]  It's beautiful.
[01:57:52.214 --> 01:58:03.902]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:58:04.462 --> 01:58:09.546]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:58:10.006 --> 01:58:11.207]  It's made in the USA.
[01:58:12.708 --> 01:58:13.368]  We're good to go!
[01:58:35.353 --> 01:58:36.034]  And of strength.
[01:58:36.995 --> 01:58:40.398]  Because this is what I personally use for myself and my family.
[01:58:40.798 --> 01:58:48.384]  We've gone through five or six different permutations in the last four years, since we launched in 4 Wars Life, to actually come up with this.
[01:58:49.185 --> 01:59:00.395]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:59:00.635 --> 01:59:15.095]  If you're not mitigating the pesticides, the heavy metals, the chemicals, if you're not trying to purify your water, if you're not trying to take products like Z-Shield that are full of known concentrated compounds that'll purify our cells and our bodies, you're crazy.
[01:59:15.595 --> 01:59:16.316]  You owe it to yourself.
[01:59:17.077 --> 01:59:26.903]  You owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world, that patriots stay as healthy, and as clean, and as focused as you can be.
[01:59:26.963 --> 01:59:35.229]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level, and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:59:35.429 --> 01:59:42.073]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the new world order.
[01:59:43.166 --> 01:59:46.950]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[01:59:47.411 --> 01:59:51.795]  Now it's time to change our bodies with a Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:59:54.558 --> 02:00:00.485]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:16.548 --> 02:00:21.390]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.731 --> 02:00:25.472]  North Korea, here's the report.
[02:00:26.172 --> 02:00:30.974]  Is this the calm before the storm, as President Trump recently hinted at?
[02:00:30.994 --> 02:00:33.035]  You guys know what this represents?
[02:00:33.915 --> 02:00:37.136]  Well, the reason the economy was strong.
[02:00:37.256 --> 02:00:40.898]  Western farmers could be, uh, economically strong.
[02:00:41.398 --> 02:00:49.646]  And according to defense sources, President Trump may visit the DMZ on the Korean border in early November when he visits South Korea.
[02:00:49.766 --> 02:00:52.708]  In North Korea, our goal is denuclearization.
[02:00:53.289 --> 02:01:00.955]  We cannot allow this dictatorship to threaten our nation or our allies with unimaginable loss of life.
[02:01:01.916 --> 02:01:07.121]  We will do what we must do to prevent that from happening, and it will be done if necessary, believe me.
[02:01:07.401 --> 02:01:14.985]  Former President Carter has now offered to intervene, according to South Korean newspaper Korea Joong-Ang Daily.
[02:01:15.225 --> 02:01:25.050]  University of Georgia Professor of Public and International Affairs Park Han-shik told the South Korean paper, should former President Carter be able to visit North Korea,
[02:01:25.350 --> 02:01:36.363]  He would like to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and discuss a peace treaty between the United States and the North and a complete denuclearization of North Korea.
[02:01:36.603 --> 02:01:40.027]  Park said Carter wants to prevent a second Korean war.
[02:01:40.247 --> 02:01:42.428]  The threat of North Korea reaching U.S.
[02:01:42.508 --> 02:01:50.812]  territory after modernization of a ballistic missile with a range of 3,000 kilometers has the international community scratching its head.
[02:01:51.073 --> 02:01:59.297]  Reuters reports Interfax cited Anton Murazov, a lawmaker and member of the lower house of the Russian Parliament's International Affairs Committee.
[02:01:59.517 --> 02:02:06.861]  Razov was quoted as saying there was no talk about the deadline for solving this task regarding the ballistic missile.
[02:02:07.062 --> 02:02:15.927]  Hawaii News Now reported University of Hawaii students recently received an email with the subject reading in the event of a nuclear attack.
[02:02:16.127 --> 02:02:29.658]  New York Daily News reports, experts believe that the Hermit Kingdom has also made progress on miniaturizing a warhead that could fit onto an intercontinental ballistic missile which could reach Hawaii in about 20 minutes.
[02:02:30.118 --> 02:02:30.398]  U.S.
[02:02:30.438 --> 02:02:35.922]  Secretary of Defense James Mattis has alerted the military in case diplomacy fails.
[02:02:36.143 --> 02:02:37.143]  What can the U.S.
[02:02:37.223 --> 02:02:42.828]  military do to lessen the likelihood of conflict on the Korean Peninsula?
[02:02:44.578 --> 02:02:45.839]  What a great question.
[02:02:46.719 --> 02:02:53.903]  Let me talk about Korea for a minute because it's on all of our minds and you know there's a reason that I recommended T.R.
[02:02:53.983 --> 02:02:57.304]  Ferenbeck's book that we all pull it out and read it one more time.
[02:02:57.324 --> 02:03:10.151]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is right now a diplomatically led, economic sanction buttressed effort to try to turn North Korea off this path.
[02:03:11.277 --> 02:03:12.657]  Now what does the future hold?
[02:03:12.677 --> 02:03:14.878]  Neither you nor I can say.
[02:03:15.418 --> 02:03:16.959]  So there's one thing the U.S.
[02:03:17.039 --> 02:03:17.759]  Army can do.
[02:03:18.539 --> 02:03:26.602]  And that is you have got to be ready to ensure that we have military options that our president can employ if needed.
[02:03:27.602 --> 02:03:31.984]  We currently, we currently are in a diplomatically led effort.
[02:03:33.379 --> 02:03:42.828]  And how many times have you seen the UN Security Council vote unanimously, now twice in a row, to impose stronger sanctions on North Korea?
[02:03:43.469 --> 02:03:49.254]  And remember, the Security Council has countries like France and Russia, China, the United States.
[02:03:49.655 --> 02:03:50.576]  You know who's on there.
[02:03:51.216 --> 02:03:52.177]  And all voted.
[02:03:53.679 --> 02:04:15.272]  So, here we are, our troops yet again facing the fog of war, while spoiled, ungrateful, ball-chasing millionaire swine refuse to support those that represent their very survival.
[02:04:15.512 --> 02:04:18.274]  John Bowne, reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:04:19.881 --> 02:04:25.986]  Because Hollywood and the whole NFL trash and all of it think it's cool to hate America.
[02:04:26.587 --> 02:04:33.472]  But they haven't been anywhere else to see the fact that they're complete morons.
[02:04:34.653 --> 02:04:37.255]  But globalists are occupiers of this country.
[02:04:39.397 --> 02:04:40.238]  They know what they're doing.
[02:04:42.136 --> 02:04:43.337]  And so there are enemies.
[02:04:43.377 --> 02:04:44.478]  That's why they have this attitude.
[02:04:44.498 --> 02:04:51.724]  So all their minions have the same attitude that a rapist should have raping your mother in front of you.
[02:04:52.465 --> 02:04:54.487]  I mean, they're the enemy, folks.
[02:04:54.927 --> 02:04:58.350]  That's why they hate the country and want to stop the recovery and everything else.
[02:04:59.151 --> 02:05:00.192]  Well, good luck, scum.
[02:05:00.212 --> 02:05:00.873]  You want to fight?
[02:05:01.573 --> 02:05:02.214]  You got one.
[02:05:03.809 --> 02:05:12.494]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[02:05:12.554 --> 02:05:13.014]  That's right.
[02:05:13.074 --> 02:05:18.077]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rites freeze dryers.
[02:05:18.357 --> 02:05:24.821]  Go to infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology that's easy to use.
[02:05:25.021 --> 02:05:32.285]  And let me tell you something, it is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[02:05:32.605 --> 02:05:32.785]  Woo!
[02:05:32.845 --> 02:05:33.765]  That's what I'm talking about.
[02:05:33.885 --> 02:05:42.468]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[02:05:42.608 --> 02:05:51.851]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[02:05:52.211 --> 02:05:55.532]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[02:05:55.652 --> 02:05:59.614]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[02:05:59.754 --> 02:06:00.614]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:06:03.055 --> 02:06:24.480]  I grow up.
[02:06:24.520 --> 02:06:25.480]  I want to be a rock star.
[02:06:25.540 --> 02:06:25.820]  I grew up.
[02:06:28.590 --> 02:06:29.010]  Violent.
[02:06:30.331 --> 02:06:30.692]  Future.
[02:06:32.693 --> 02:06:38.837]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:06:39.198 --> 02:06:42.640]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:06:42.700 --> 02:06:45.863]  Ladies and gentlemen, these mics are terrible.
[02:06:46.103 --> 02:06:48.124]  Alex Jones on lead guitar.
[02:07:05.470 --> 02:07:11.539]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[02:07:11.980 --> 02:07:13.382]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:07:26.440 --> 02:07:28.661]  Michael Caputo is our guest.
[02:07:28.681 --> 02:07:30.923]  He, of course, worked high-level with the Trump campaign.
[02:07:31.383 --> 02:07:39.128]  A lot of you have seen him in congressional testimonies and seen the media try to demonize him, but now the whole Russia narrative has collapsed.
[02:07:40.088 --> 02:07:46.812]  It's come out that they used executive branch money to investigate the president with this whole made-up thing, and that's illegal.
[02:07:47.713 --> 02:07:51.755]  Even CNN admits that Mueller is running around doing things that are illegal.
[02:07:53.256 --> 02:07:55.998]  So, take a knee, stomp my foot.
[02:07:58.908 --> 02:08:06.814]  Michael Caputo is a writer and Republican political operative from Buffalo, New York, a graduate of Hamburg High School.
[02:08:06.854 --> 02:08:07.454]  He served the U.S.
[02:08:07.515 --> 02:08:11.898]  Army 25th Infantry Division, a major in journalism in sunny Buffalo.
[02:08:12.118 --> 02:08:18.963]  He also worked as a writer for the late Jack Kemp, a press aide for Congress, and a media advisor to George H.W.
[02:08:18.983 --> 02:08:23.487]  Bush, an election consultant to Russian President Boris Yeltsin's Kremlin.
[02:08:24.207 --> 02:08:26.388]  And dozens of other high-profile campaigns.
[02:08:26.448 --> 02:08:31.891]  And they use the fact that, working under the CIA, he was sent in for U.S.
[02:08:31.971 --> 02:08:32.751]  interest in Russia.
[02:08:33.352 --> 02:08:44.417]  They were so desperate for, if you remember, evidence of Russian-Trump collusion, that they went after the Trump adviser from his campaign, claiming, well, you lived in Russia, so you're a Russian agent.
[02:08:45.038 --> 02:08:45.918]  Wow, that's next level.
[02:08:45.938 --> 02:08:47.359]  But he joins us to get into
[02:08:48.826 --> 02:09:01.018]  Everything that's happened now, everything that's unfolded, with the NFL doubling down against America just a month ago, Trump said, you disrespect our veterans, our flag, our country.
[02:09:01.539 --> 02:09:06.163]  And the commissioner of the NFL said, no, you disrespect the NFL like they were God.
[02:09:06.784 --> 02:09:13.047]  Well, they've had a 35-point-plus drop just this year, 20-plus points before that.
[02:09:13.087 --> 02:09:14.287]  That's 55 points.
[02:09:14.627 --> 02:09:16.768]  That's more than half their audience the last four years.
[02:09:17.649 --> 02:09:25.832]  I mean, you talk about committing suicide, but it's just like Hollywood is committing suicide on the altar of liberalism, globalism, and America-hating.
[02:09:26.192 --> 02:09:27.233]  Why do they hate
[02:09:27.893 --> 02:09:33.284]  The fans, the flyover country that go see their movies and that go see their football games.
[02:09:33.825 --> 02:09:35.589]  Why are they so suicidal?
[02:09:35.629 --> 02:09:37.893]  Where is the common sense, Michael Caputo?
[02:09:38.826 --> 02:09:46.311]  Well, I'll tell you, the narrative sure has shifted since Vice President Pence walked out of that Indianapolis-San Francisco game last weekend.
[02:09:46.771 --> 02:09:47.452]  It's shifted a lot.
[02:09:47.472 --> 02:09:48.813]  It's shifted a lot for me, too.
[02:09:48.933 --> 02:09:50.514]  I'm a big, huge NFL fan.
[02:09:50.534 --> 02:09:53.736]  I'm a Buffalo Bills fan genetically.
[02:09:54.476 --> 02:10:00.320]  My office, where I am right now, is on the same street of the Buffalo Bills Stadium here in Orchard Park, New York.
[02:10:00.760 --> 02:10:06.204]  And ask me to boycott the Buffalo Bills, and you're asking me to cut off my right leg, you know?
[02:10:06.864 --> 02:10:12.467]  I mean, I actually missed a couple of games and didn't watch a couple of games trying to figure all this out.
[02:10:13.087 --> 02:10:17.550]  But Vice President Pence, when he walked out, I was very proud of him.
[02:10:17.950 --> 02:10:19.411]  I think that shifted the whole narrative.
[02:10:19.751 --> 02:10:30.757]  Because right now, I understand from a reporter friend of mine, that teams are getting absolutely record requests for refunds on their season tickets.
[02:10:31.617 --> 02:10:39.039]  The Jacksonville Jaguars have more than 1,000 people who have called in and demanded a refund for their season tickets.
[02:10:39.099 --> 02:10:47.262]  If that happens to, let's say, the New England Patriots, they'll have 2,000 people lining up to buy those season tickets.
[02:10:47.722 --> 02:10:49.543]  But in Jacksonville, that's not true.
[02:10:50.103 --> 02:10:57.225]  And you don't have the New England Patriot-type teams, if you don't have the Jacksonville Jaguar teams, to play them.
[02:10:57.865 --> 02:11:06.727]  So things really turned around at that point, and I think it's coming to a point where it's coming to an end finally.
[02:11:06.827 --> 02:11:24.151]  I appeared on a radio show earlier today where the rhetoric out of guys like Robert Klimko, who's a football writer out of Sports Illustrated, now they're saying things like, you know, if you don't agree with what the players are doing, you don't have the capacity to understand.
[02:11:24.671 --> 02:11:26.512]  But that's the kind of rhetoric they're leaning back on.
[02:11:26.712 --> 02:11:27.852]  Oh, total elitism.
[02:11:27.892 --> 02:11:33.294]  I mean, I've seen the SPN reports that, well, you know, you're violating our rights.
[02:11:33.374 --> 02:11:38.056]  No, you go to a football game, you piss on America, we have a right to leave.
[02:11:38.556 --> 02:11:45.979]  As you said to the Vice President, it's that revolutionary act of us removing our economic support for the suppressive system.
[02:11:46.179 --> 02:11:49.340]  Just like Gandhi said, don't buy salt from the British anymore.
[02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:51.041]  Go to the ocean and get it.
[02:11:51.241 --> 02:11:52.081]  That one act
[02:11:52.721 --> 02:12:09.306]  It's true, and you may see the indignance still coming out of the liberal media, and certainly the shift of attitude of the folks who are supporting this.
[02:12:10.246 --> 02:12:18.053]  This protest during the National Anthem is now shifting away from trying to convince you to now saying you're just stupid.
[02:12:18.493 --> 02:12:23.097]  You know, we're at a point right now where we're just talking past each other, you know?
[02:12:23.617 --> 02:12:36.889]  And I believe, really, that the idea that the Jacksonville Jaguars could in one fell swoop lose probably now thousands of season tickets, it's the economic power of the NFL fan that changed this thing.
[02:12:37.629 --> 02:12:47.572]  Michael Capito, you're absolutely right, as a top Republican patriot strategist out there, I want to come back from breaking into Bannon and the whole revolution, Civil War, Republican Party, but we're winning.
[02:12:47.972 --> 02:13:02.476]  If they've gone from whole teams kneeling a month ago to only a few guys doing it, the NFL says stop it, the NBA says stop it, and they're losing massive percentages of their viewers, that shows America has spoken.
[02:13:02.816 --> 02:13:04.577]  Is this not a crushing defeat for them?
[02:13:05.390 --> 02:13:14.101]  That's absolutely true, and I'll tell you, the economic power of populism is coming more and more to the forefront.
[02:13:14.161 --> 02:13:18.766]  In fact, I think we're starting to win across the board and that's why the rhetoric is getting even hotter.
[02:13:19.067 --> 02:13:21.350]  That's why the Russia investigation, for example,
[02:13:22.350 --> 02:13:25.933]  Look at what they're doing to Roger Stone, my good friend, your good friend.
[02:13:26.573 --> 02:13:36.980]  They're now threatening to subpoena him for what he could be regarded as a reporter or a journalist in some kind of a challenging court, demanding that he give his sources, and he's refusing.
[02:13:37.601 --> 02:13:46.987]  In the Obama era, when some of the liberal side's consultants like Roger were subpoenaed, they just ignored it.
[02:13:47.727 --> 02:13:58.595]  Sure, but you're not supposed to say it, Michael, but it's come out in Congress.
[02:13:59.015 --> 02:14:04.979]  You were not in the CIA, but it was a CIA operation to keep Yeltsin in power for America.
[02:14:05.260 --> 02:14:11.884]  They're so desperate, all they've got is to say that a CIA operative who lived in Russia is their evidence?
[02:14:12.104 --> 02:14:14.506]  That's all they've got is burning their own operatives?
[02:14:14.806 --> 02:14:15.687]  That's their proof?
[02:14:15.747 --> 02:14:16.808]  I mean, this is ridiculous!
[02:14:17.804 --> 02:14:19.807]  The CIA could never afford me, I'm afraid, though.
[02:14:19.827 --> 02:14:23.994]  But I'll tell you, the operation... No, but I mean, in general, I looked it up.
[02:14:24.035 --> 02:14:28.062]  That whole operation to keep Yeltsin in was in the purview of the State Department and the CIA, correct?
[02:14:28.479 --> 02:14:31.481]  Well, I mean, there are a lot of government interests in Yeltsin's re-election.
[02:14:31.501 --> 02:14:34.904]  Well, the point is the nerve of you propping up Yeltsin when that was U.S.
[02:14:34.944 --> 02:14:38.026]  policy, and now they say you're a dirty commie.
[02:14:38.086 --> 02:14:39.047]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[02:14:39.347 --> 02:14:41.709]  Well, I was sent over there by the Clinton administration.
[02:14:41.909 --> 02:14:47.913]  I worked under Clinton administration operatives in the United States Embassy there.
[02:14:48.354 --> 02:14:50.735]  The public affairs program running out of the U.S.
[02:14:50.796 --> 02:14:54.038]  Embassy was vast and multi-multi-millions of dollars.
[02:14:54.138 --> 02:14:59.602]  Sure, it just shows how they're burning American patriots in an attempt to claim some Russian connection.
[02:14:59.822 --> 02:15:02.063]  Next they're going to say John Wayne is a Russian agent.
[02:15:02.904 --> 02:15:06.386]  Well, I'll tell you, and they're great guys, you know.
[02:15:06.706 --> 02:15:22.437]  I can tell you, there were 16, 17 national democratic players who were connected to Obama, connected to Clinton, who at the time when Hillary Clinton's campaign created this whole bogus Russia-Trump charge,
[02:15:22.857 --> 02:15:32.244]  There were 16, 17 of her colleagues in the operative level who were registered agents of the Kremlin and Kremlin connected companies.
[02:15:32.664 --> 02:15:40.950]  Registered agents who were among them making millions of dollars representing the interests of the Kremlin.
[02:15:41.410 --> 02:15:45.533]  And those are just the ones who declared their actual income.
[02:15:47.274 --> 02:15:49.697]  Politics New York, we're going to come right back to you.
[02:15:49.757 --> 02:15:51.098]  Politicsny.net.
[02:15:51.158 --> 02:15:58.426]  We're going to come back and ask your crystal ball where you see the Trump revolution, where it is, banning the whole fight, and more straight ahead.
[02:15:58.466 --> 02:16:01.048]  But let me tell you, NFL, jump the shark baby!
[02:16:02.950 --> 02:16:04.492]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running
[02:16:05.754 --> 02:16:11.077]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[02:16:11.337 --> 02:16:12.478]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[02:16:12.718 --> 02:16:15.019]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[02:16:15.700 --> 02:16:22.203]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[02:16:22.404 --> 02:16:25.745]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[02:16:26.066 --> 02:16:27.867]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[02:16:28.507 --> 02:16:36.938]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[02:16:36.958 --> 02:16:37.920]  They know how great it is.
[02:16:38.841 --> 02:16:42.586]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[02:16:43.527 --> 02:16:44.929]  Tropic means for the brain.
[02:16:45.730 --> 02:16:53.598]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[02:16:54.039 --> 02:16:59.985]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[02:17:05.071 --> 02:17:05.471]  That comes to $50.03.
[02:17:05.631 --> 02:17:09.653]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[02:17:10.073 --> 02:17:13.215]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[02:17:13.255 --> 02:17:14.195]  It's a good deal at $39.

[02:18:39.439 --> 02:18:40.880]  Next level compared to whey.
[02:18:41.101 --> 02:18:42.702]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[02:18:43.122 --> 02:18:44.002]  It's incredible.
[02:18:44.483 --> 02:18:46.384]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[02:18:46.564 --> 02:18:48.525]  It's bigger than I am already at 15.
[02:18:48.605 --> 02:18:49.086]  Incredible.
[02:18:49.406 --> 02:18:50.286]  It is amazing.
[02:18:50.647 --> 02:18:51.928]  Infowarslife.com.

[02:18:56.631 --> 02:18:58.932]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.

[02:19:04.976 --> 02:19:05.636]  The globalists win.
[02:19:05.656 --> 02:19:06.376]  We're all slaves.
[02:19:06.617 --> 02:19:07.777]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[02:19:08.177 --> 02:19:08.978]  I want to thank you.

[02:20:05.864 --> 02:20:08.566]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:08.947 --> 02:20:09.407]  Neil.
[02:20:09.707 --> 02:20:10.948]  But Neil to what?
[02:20:12.350 --> 02:20:14.671]  You are the one they call President.
[02:20:14.952 --> 02:20:15.172]  I am.
[02:20:16.053 --> 02:20:16.153]  Neil.
[02:20:21.867 --> 02:20:23.628]  Kneel before Zeus!
[02:20:33.254 --> 02:20:34.095]  You are not the president.
[02:20:35.115 --> 02:20:38.417]  No one who leads so many could possibly kneel so promptly.
[02:20:38.638 --> 02:20:48.424]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:20:49.024 --> 02:20:50.565]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:55.481 --> 02:21:02.625]  Alright, high-level Trump advisor during the 2016 epic populist rebellion joins us, Michael Caputo.
[02:21:03.005 --> 02:21:09.909]  Finishing up with the NFL, the collapse of Hollywood financially, culturally, MSN, all the major channels,
[02:21:11.490 --> 02:21:26.521]  Their attempt is to censor and to shut down and say we're all Russian agents and the Russians did it when the EU, the Vatican, the Saudi Arabians, Hollywood, the big telecoms, the big tech companies, all ganged up on Flyover America, tried to start a race war.
[02:21:27.661 --> 02:21:28.522]  That all blew up.
[02:21:29.443 --> 02:21:32.185]  And then now they're kneeling during the anthem.
[02:21:33.206 --> 02:21:42.811]  And then it goes on for years, then the fans leave, and as you said, they call us stupid, or we're censoring them, not seeing crybabies that make $10 million a year.
[02:21:43.371 --> 02:21:44.131]  This is crazy.
[02:21:44.151 --> 02:21:46.352]  You've got Bannon saying, burn down the Republican Party.
[02:21:46.372 --> 02:21:46.772]  I agree.
[02:21:47.153 --> 02:21:47.853]  The Blue Bloods.
[02:21:48.633 --> 02:21:50.294]  The Democrats are burning themselves down.
[02:21:50.334 --> 02:21:53.576]  Jerry Brown's legalizing giving people HIV in California.
[02:21:53.976 --> 02:21:56.577]  Michael Caputo, politicsny.net.
[02:21:57.037 --> 02:21:58.218]  What is going on here?
[02:21:59.083 --> 02:22:00.024]  It's really interesting.
[02:22:00.145 --> 02:22:13.981]  I think, like you said in the previous segment, we're at the point now where the supporters of Donald Trump and the populist nationalist movement in the United States is really gaining a lot of ground here.
[02:22:14.001 --> 02:22:17.264]  I'm really interested in what Steve Bannon is doing and his
[02:22:18.886 --> 02:22:19.806]  We're good to go.
[02:22:41.734 --> 02:22:48.741]  And I'll tell you, at least the news momentum right now is, the alarm is being rung by the media.
[02:22:48.801 --> 02:22:52.444]  The alarm is being rung by the establishment Republicans.
[02:22:52.484 --> 02:22:54.246]  Oh, look at Corker and all them not running.
[02:22:54.286 --> 02:22:55.367]  I mean, they are scared.
[02:22:55.407 --> 02:22:58.690]  And I'm not, I don't want to take credit for Bannon, but I want the audience to know they get the credit.
[02:22:59.130 --> 02:23:10.053]  Bannon is just trying to organize and motivate the already huge overthrow of all incumbents, all special elections, all run-offs, Republican run-offs, I mean everywhere.
[02:23:10.133 --> 02:23:13.814]  Establishment Democrat, Republicans out, and so surfing in is Bannon.
[02:23:13.834 --> 02:23:14.534]  More power to him.
[02:23:14.834 --> 02:23:16.815]  Great organization skills, great what he's doing.
[02:23:17.155 --> 02:23:21.856]  I want the audience to understand though, this is America totally sending a message, we're done.
[02:23:22.955 --> 02:23:23.776]  There's no question.
[02:23:23.796 --> 02:23:33.883]  You know, I was visiting with Steve Bannon and his team last week, along with former Congressman Michael Grimm and other operatives.
[02:23:33.943 --> 02:23:38.546]  And you can't believe, you know, they call the building there the Breitbart Embassy.
[02:23:38.566 --> 02:23:42.889]  You know, how it's just brimming with energy and activity.
[02:23:42.909 --> 02:23:50.995]  And also, I was very impressed by how many United States military veterans they have working there, especially there's a good number of Marines in there.
[02:23:51.055 --> 02:23:51.695]  It's a really
[02:23:51.875 --> 02:23:53.857]  Because this is the retaking of America.
[02:23:53.917 --> 02:23:55.219]  This is a military operation.
[02:23:55.439 --> 02:23:56.240]  This is war.
[02:23:56.300 --> 02:24:06.472]  And that group absolutely understands that this is much bigger than them and they're just trying to harness the energy of this movement to drain the swamp and
[02:24:07.092 --> 02:24:10.895]  But is it that why they say, oh, Infowars are banned and don't use the term war?
[02:24:11.575 --> 02:24:13.457]  Hollywood, the globalists, they're at war!
[02:24:13.737 --> 02:24:16.238]  They want America to bankrupt so they can control it.
[02:24:16.479 --> 02:24:19.240]  They're pissed that Trump has the economy coming back.
[02:24:19.300 --> 02:24:20.661]  I mean, this is really war.
[02:24:21.022 --> 02:24:22.763]  And they don't want us to know it's war.
[02:24:23.618 --> 02:24:30.424]  Well, I'll tell you, the folks over at Breitbart Embassy know that they're fighting a really tough uphill battle.
[02:24:30.444 --> 02:24:31.184]  That's for darn sure.
[02:24:31.264 --> 02:24:35.368]  And I think that we're still fighting it in the administration as well.
[02:24:35.408 --> 02:24:38.731]  We still see anti-Trump people in the administration.
[02:24:39.211 --> 02:24:42.574]  But despite all of them, Trump's instincts continue to shine through.
[02:24:42.594 --> 02:24:43.935]  I mean, there's a paradox there.
[02:24:44.900 --> 02:24:50.763]  Absolutely, but you know, I talked to Keith Shiller, who is the president's former security director, who recently left.
[02:24:50.783 --> 02:24:51.883]  Oh yeah, why did he leave?
[02:24:51.923 --> 02:24:53.344]  What really happened?
[02:24:53.364 --> 02:25:00.207]  Well, I mean, he told me that all these stories going on right now about how he and General Kelly were fighting are absolutely false.
[02:25:00.247 --> 02:25:07.550]  And I have friends of mine who don't believe that, but Keith told me he left because he just couldn't afford it anymore, and he hated it.
[02:25:08.050 --> 02:25:09.231]  He hated everything about it.
[02:25:09.271 --> 02:25:13.895]  He hated the way that people were stabbing his guy in the back, and he couldn't do nothing about that.
[02:25:14.295 --> 02:25:22.542]  He's now down in Florida in private business, but Keith told me that every single morning he would greet the President at the residence door.
[02:25:22.602 --> 02:25:31.329]  It was part of his job to get him and take him down to the Oval Office, and that was their time every morning, to and from the residence.
[02:25:31.749 --> 02:25:36.373]  And he told me that every single morning, no matter how he got beat down the day before,
[02:25:36.893 --> 02:25:37.614]  That's the spirit.
[02:25:37.634 --> 02:25:38.355]  He understands he's in a fight.
[02:25:38.375 --> 02:25:40.398]  He's not going to let them demoralize him.
[02:25:40.418 --> 02:25:41.800]  It's that spirit they hate.
[02:25:54.326 --> 02:25:54.686]  That's the truth.
[02:25:55.006 --> 02:25:56.347]  And they've never seen it before.
[02:25:56.427 --> 02:25:57.948]  And it can never happen again.
[02:25:58.388 --> 02:25:58.629]  Right?
[02:25:58.949 --> 02:26:00.290]  I mean, that's why they're burning.
[02:26:00.310 --> 02:26:03.091]  They're going to try to destroy Donald Trump.
[02:26:03.111 --> 02:26:04.812]  They're going to destroy his family.
[02:26:05.153 --> 02:26:06.593]  They're going to destroy his businesses.
[02:26:06.613 --> 02:26:11.817]  They're going to destroy all his friends like Roger Stone and those of us who have worked around him before.
[02:26:12.117 --> 02:26:16.519]  Because they need a smoking crater where he once stood.
[02:26:16.680 --> 02:26:18.481]  They want that to be a message to everyone.
[02:26:21.002 --> 02:26:22.123]  They want it to be a message to everyone.
[02:26:22.163 --> 02:26:23.864]  You stand up for America, we're going to destroy you, Michael.
[02:26:24.264 --> 02:26:24.724]  That's right.
[02:26:24.825 --> 02:26:35.395]  And if any billionaire with a high-minded idea of helping America comes forward in 10, 15 years after Donald Trump, they want people to say, are you crazy, Bill?
[02:26:35.895 --> 02:26:37.557]  They're going to Donald Trump you.
[02:26:37.597 --> 02:26:41.921]  But haven't all the attacks only lit him on fire like the sun?
[02:26:41.941 --> 02:26:43.943]  I mean, it's really backfiring.
[02:26:43.963 --> 02:26:44.524]  This is epic.
[02:26:45.154 --> 02:27:01.107]  It is, and like Keith Shiller told me, it's just an unusual man in horrible circumstances can stand up and do great things, and I'm really glad folks like Steve Bannon and others are standing up, because I think, actually, Alex, we're starting to move the ball.
[02:27:02.408 --> 02:27:03.669]  Oh, I think you're being conservative.
[02:27:03.689 --> 02:27:07.632]  I don't want to be too positive for folks, because the enemy can do some big stuff, but look at Hollywood.
[02:27:07.652 --> 02:27:10.154]  Look at the NFL's collapse.
[02:27:10.214 --> 02:27:14.097]  They're destroying themselves in their attempt to stop America and its resurgence.
[02:27:14.747 --> 02:27:15.228]  It really is.
[02:27:15.288 --> 02:27:25.842]  And you see the half-baked comedians holding out bloody masks of the president, and then they absolutely self-destruct.
[02:27:25.882 --> 02:27:29.407]  And now you see the movement behind disrespecting
[02:27:29.847 --> 02:27:38.497]  The National Anthem, no matter what their reasons are, because they have every right to protest, and I never want to see anyone not granted their rights to protest.
[02:27:38.597 --> 02:27:41.360]  If their employer's issue with them, I get that.
[02:27:41.781 --> 02:27:49.430]  I don't like the fact that they stomp on the values of veterans and combat veterans and the families of those who we've lost.
[02:27:50.090 --> 02:27:51.671]  And they don't get that.
[02:27:51.731 --> 02:27:52.711]  I'm sorry, they do get that.
[02:27:52.731 --> 02:27:55.493]  They know that that's what they're doing, but they don't care.
[02:27:55.513 --> 02:28:04.177]  And because of that disdain for long-standing tradition and reverence to those who have given their lives to this country, they're losing again.
[02:28:04.981 --> 02:28:19.726]  It's always this tone-deaf view of America, where you can hold up a mask of the president dripping blood, and you think you can do these, or kneel in disrespect of veterans and the families of the fallen, and you can prevail?
[02:28:20.406 --> 02:28:21.346]  Those days are over.
[02:28:21.966 --> 02:28:22.367]  That's right.
[02:28:22.407 --> 02:28:25.007]  America was asleep, now she's awake.
[02:28:25.968 --> 02:28:27.928]  Politicsny.net.
[02:28:28.289 --> 02:28:30.149]  Milo Goputo, please join us again very soon.
[02:28:30.209 --> 02:28:30.809]  Thank you, my friend.
[02:28:31.129 --> 02:28:31.610]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:28:31.630 --> 02:28:31.990]  Take care.
[02:28:34.175 --> 02:28:37.196]  We're gonna come back to all the news I haven't gotten to yet, but it's true.
[02:28:37.256 --> 02:28:38.377]  It's the Animating Contest.
[02:28:38.437 --> 02:28:39.097]  It's so real.
[02:28:40.318 --> 02:28:48.502]  Look, you just gotta be against pedophilia and Satan worship, and just wanna be a good person, and love God, and then you're in the good side.
[02:28:49.082 --> 02:28:51.023]  But see, they can't do that, folks.
[02:28:51.603 --> 02:28:53.544]  They're a pack of losers, and they're gonna lose.
[02:28:54.185 --> 02:28:56.005]  We're gonna make sure they do.
[02:28:56.065 --> 02:28:57.086]  This is the resistance.
[02:29:03.103 --> 02:29:11.268]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running the biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[02:29:11.528 --> 02:29:15.190]  Now Brain Force Plus, there's 20% more in each bottle.
[02:29:15.871 --> 02:29:22.374]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States, we've been able to get it for less.
[02:29:22.594 --> 02:29:25.916]  So I'm offering for the first time ever, 50% off.
[02:29:26.237 --> 02:29:28.038]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[02:29:28.678 --> 02:29:37.108]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[02:29:37.128 --> 02:29:38.089]  They know how great it is.
[02:29:39.010 --> 02:29:42.754]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[02:29:43.695 --> 02:29:45.096]  Tropic means for the brain.
[02:29:45.897 --> 02:29:53.763]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[02:29:54.203 --> 02:30:00.007]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[02:30:05.231 --> 02:30:05.652]  That comes to $50.03.
[02:30:05.772 --> 02:30:09.836]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[02:30:10.256 --> 02:30:13.399]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[02:30:13.439 --> 02:30:14.380]  It's a good deal at $39.
[02:30:15.561 --> 02:30:16.282]  It's $19.96 at Infowarslife.com.

[02:31:27.491 --> 02:31:36.382]  I'm gonna have to end even sooner our caveman ultimate paleo bone broth turmeric chaga mushroom bee pollen and more.
[02:31:36.903 --> 02:31:37.544]  Concentrate.
[02:31:37.564 --> 02:31:39.345]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[02:31:39.605 --> 02:31:41.026]  Next level compared to whey.
[02:31:41.046 --> 02:31:42.887]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[02:31:43.307 --> 02:31:44.168]  It's incredible.
[02:31:44.648 --> 02:31:46.550]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[02:31:46.750 --> 02:31:47.891]  It's bigger than I am already.
[02:31:48.351 --> 02:31:49.251]  At 15, incredible.
[02:31:49.572 --> 02:31:50.452]  It is amazing.
[02:31:50.833 --> 02:31:52.093]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:52.534 --> 02:31:55.196]  50% off caveman, but only a few days left.
[02:31:55.456 --> 02:31:56.236]  It's about to end.
[02:31:56.797 --> 02:31:59.098]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[02:31:59.579 --> 02:32:00.279]  We're the tip of the
[02:32:00.399 --> 02:32:00.819]  We're good to go.
[02:32:21.677 --> 02:32:25.120]  On sale right now at InfoWarsLive.com, you're fighting the tip of the spear.
[02:32:25.340 --> 02:32:27.182]  But these specials have got to end.
[02:32:27.682 --> 02:32:37.090]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer Brain Force at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.
[02:32:37.351 --> 02:32:42.715]  But again, thank you all for your support because this helps fund our operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.

[02:32:56.467 --> 02:33:01.291]  That's 50% off Brain Force Plus, 50% off Caveman, but only for one week.
[02:33:05.875 --> 02:33:08.517]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:21.588 --> 02:33:32.652]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:37.293 --> 02:33:39.374]  It's not that the American flag's perfect.
[02:33:39.454 --> 02:33:42.455]  It's not that they haven't used it to launch wars that are wrong.
[02:33:43.355 --> 02:33:46.216]  It's not that we don't get sometimes it can be a little cheesy.
[02:33:47.555 --> 02:33:55.821]  Until you realize there's a widow there that lost her son, or a father there that lost his daughter, or a sister there that lost her brother.
[02:33:55.921 --> 02:34:02.446]  And then you realize that all we have is these old institutions.
[02:34:02.486 --> 02:34:05.188]  And they're not perfect, but the globalists are pushing.
[02:34:05.449 --> 02:34:07.510]  Oh, we know it's real bad.
[02:34:07.930 --> 02:34:09.051]  It's not based on people.
[02:34:10.172 --> 02:34:11.293]  It's not based on strength.
[02:34:11.993 --> 02:34:12.874]  It's based on lies.
[02:34:12.894 --> 02:34:14.716]  It's based on fraud.
[02:34:15.987 --> 02:34:19.990]  They want to override everything, not to make it better, but to make it worse.
[02:34:20.351 --> 02:34:21.852]  America was the override.
[02:34:23.433 --> 02:34:24.935]  The Renaissance was the override.
[02:34:25.175 --> 02:34:31.800]  True human empowerment, bring down the royals, bring down the elites, free market, ideas, total open society.
[02:34:33.201 --> 02:34:36.524]  Soros calls his group that because he's fighting open society.
[02:34:42.009 --> 02:34:42.910]  Society where
[02:34:43.902 --> 02:34:47.425]  People vote with their money, with their dollars, where they go, what they do.
[02:34:47.805 --> 02:34:49.927]  That creates high civilization.
[02:34:51.628 --> 02:34:54.751]  The knowledge of the crowd, human empowerment, not what they're doing.
[02:34:54.771 --> 02:35:09.463]  And when you realize this whole rebellion is like trying to get a bunch of metaphysical Harry Weinsteins off your back that are raping you, then you understand it's not like you're even trying to run something or go somewhere.
[02:35:09.523 --> 02:35:11.705]  You just want people off your back.
[02:35:13.797 --> 02:35:14.457]  That's all this is.
[02:35:15.578 --> 02:35:28.362]  Because normal people, if we get evil people off our backs and learn the instinct to be against them and learn to stand against them when they try to get an inch because they'll take it a mile, we'll build nirvana, Valhalla, heaven.
[02:35:31.423 --> 02:35:33.103]  But isn't our imperfection already that?
[02:35:34.064 --> 02:35:39.665]  They tell you all day they're gonna make you perfect by following what they say.
[02:35:39.685 --> 02:35:41.346]  It's like Rose McGowan put out
[02:35:42.679 --> 02:35:43.720]  Weinstein, write me.
[02:35:46.544 --> 02:35:50.369]  Twitter suspends her account.
[02:35:50.389 --> 02:35:59.160]  Oh, it's the woman, it's the feminist, it's the... Oh, but at that point, see, you don't protect her because what you claim you're promoting and what you're doing is the opposite.
[02:36:01.778 --> 02:36:02.579]  See, that's the joke.
[02:36:02.639 --> 02:36:04.900]  It's like the old Dragnet TV show.
[02:36:04.920 --> 02:36:10.322]  They made a movie about it in the 80s with Tom Hanks and Aykroyd.
[02:36:12.143 --> 02:36:12.624]  Dragnet.
[02:36:13.604 --> 02:36:18.267]  And you got the Playboy owner, and he just is having a good time.
[02:36:18.287 --> 02:36:19.047]  He's not a bad guy.
[02:36:19.067 --> 02:36:20.107]  He's not a good guy.
[02:36:20.127 --> 02:36:23.029]  He's just, you know, kind of a seedy twit.
[02:36:26.011 --> 02:36:26.831]  But it's the preacher.
[02:36:29.036 --> 02:36:32.057]  Preachers selling drugs and devil worshiping and killing people.
[02:36:34.177 --> 02:36:35.577]  And what's Hollywood telling you there?
[02:36:39.738 --> 02:36:43.779]  They're throwing it in your face.
[02:36:45.579 --> 02:36:57.862]  And you imagine the prison that it is to be somebody like Harvey Weinstein's wife, who to make her clothing line successful, she has to marry this guy?
[02:36:59.036 --> 02:37:11.425]  Who she doesn't love, who he doesn't love, so that she can bully other stars to make them wear her clothes, and then she feels powerful by doing that.
[02:37:12.405 --> 02:37:16.988]  See, somebody that isn't a psychopath goes, that's really stupid.
[02:37:19.530 --> 02:37:22.152]  And that's why they run our lives.
[02:37:23.453 --> 02:37:24.333]  Because we
[02:37:25.819 --> 02:37:26.419]  Aren't like that.
[02:37:26.599 --> 02:37:41.102]  I couldn't imagine what my employees, like going around bullying, I'm like, if you don't wear what I want, or you don't do what I want, like trying to micromanage them and stuff, like you, you must do what I say outside in your own life, or I'm going to ruin you, because I have power!
[02:37:42.242 --> 02:37:43.683]  No, that's not power.
[02:37:44.163 --> 02:37:44.803]  That's weakness.
[02:37:46.183 --> 02:37:47.603]  But see, I don't think like that.
[02:37:49.004 --> 02:37:49.604]  I'm straight up.
[02:37:51.904 --> 02:37:52.904]  And so they think I'm weak.
[02:37:54.305 --> 02:37:55.225]  Because I'm not a devil worshiper.
[02:37:58.820 --> 02:38:02.942]  I mean, I'm so in love with God's creation and everything God's given me.
[02:38:04.983 --> 02:38:07.624]  I don't worship the creation, but I mean, I'd worship that if there wasn't God.
[02:38:07.864 --> 02:38:08.224]  Wow.
[02:38:09.124 --> 02:38:11.805]  I mean, worship just means I'm plugged in.
[02:38:11.885 --> 02:38:13.786]  I'm like, whatever you got, just keep doing it.
[02:38:17.408 --> 02:38:18.148]  I'm wedded to.
[02:38:21.909 --> 02:38:22.150]  I am.
[02:38:23.610 --> 02:38:25.051]  I mean, I'm married to Jesus Christ.
[02:38:26.218 --> 02:38:30.021]  And it doesn't mean that I don't know that I'm not wicked, but I have knowledge of that.
[02:38:30.962 --> 02:38:38.008]  And then I look at these people that are wedded to what they're wedded to, and it's like, who wants to be Quentin Tarantino?
[02:38:38.249 --> 02:38:39.270]  He's not a good director.
[02:38:39.590 --> 02:38:42.612]  He's just a degenerate and super deformed and ugly.
[02:38:44.774 --> 02:38:46.916]  So they like him because he likes to defile people.
[02:38:47.297 --> 02:38:48.538]  He's acting dumb.
[02:38:48.918 --> 02:38:51.060]  He doesn't know about the Weinstein stuff.
[02:38:51.080 --> 02:38:53.222]  Give me a break, you little thug.
[02:38:57.267 --> 02:39:14.661]  I mean, I remember seeing a film showing of The French Connection and The Exorcist because the director directed both and he was in Austin in a theater and I went with my first wife and I was there.
[02:39:19.147 --> 02:39:20.308]  There was Tarantino.
[02:39:21.008 --> 02:39:23.890]  And he was across the room, he was just staring at me like he wanted to kill me.
[02:39:24.550 --> 02:39:26.251]  He was just all upset and freaked out.
[02:39:26.852 --> 02:39:28.493]  And I saw him, he was talking crap about me and everything.
[02:39:29.033 --> 02:39:30.154]  And I just laughed at the guy.
[02:39:30.174 --> 02:39:33.936]  It's just like they spiritually, though, knew...
[02:39:35.137 --> 02:39:37.438]  Because that's one thing we've got is this time shift connection.
[02:39:38.058 --> 02:39:45.021]  They don't have a lot of knowledge spiritually about the future and about culture and about life, but they do have a sense of things.
[02:39:45.801 --> 02:39:51.364]  And he just was looking at me and hating me so much and then pointing at me and talking crap about me.
[02:39:51.784 --> 02:39:53.965]  Because the guy is a...
[02:39:55.894 --> 02:39:57.315]  Deformed demon.
[02:39:57.535 --> 02:40:07.860]  I mean, I'm sad for deformed people, but he's a deformed, ugly, stupid, warped person that a demon uses like a pen to write pulp fiction.
[02:40:08.460 --> 02:40:09.260]  He's a tool.
[02:40:09.881 --> 02:40:10.841]  He's a tool bag.
[02:40:12.682 --> 02:40:18.685]  And he sees somebody like me, who just is a normal person, a farmer.
[02:40:20.253 --> 02:40:20.914]  And he hates me.
[02:40:21.594 --> 02:40:22.575]  And he wants to destroy me.
[02:40:22.595 --> 02:40:29.803]  So we're going to come back in the next segment and I'm going to go boom, boom, boom with these five or six prompt clips I've got that are so revolutionary.
[02:40:30.263 --> 02:40:31.704]  The sun is yellow.
[02:40:32.425 --> 02:40:33.847]  The sky is blue.
[02:40:34.507 --> 02:40:35.628]  The water is wet.
[02:40:35.728 --> 02:40:38.832]  Mothers and fathers and families are wonderful.
[02:40:41.548 --> 02:40:42.969]  No!
[02:40:43.389 --> 02:40:44.629]  No, stop it!
[02:40:45.130 --> 02:40:46.770]  You'll use the language we say.
[02:40:46.830 --> 02:40:47.951]  We'll do what we say.
[02:40:48.591 --> 02:40:53.053]  It's not enough for us to get kids down in basements and pull their teeth out while they cry for mommy with pliers.
[02:40:54.114 --> 02:40:56.335]  We want to hurt your kids really bad.
[02:40:57.375 --> 02:40:59.736]  This is the only time we feel powerful because we're such slugs.
[02:40:59.876 --> 02:41:02.457]  Please, please, please let us run your life.
[02:41:02.957 --> 02:41:04.158]  No, don't!
[02:41:04.898 --> 02:41:06.939]  Don't you say families are good!
[02:41:06.959 --> 02:41:06.999]  No!
[02:41:11.021 --> 02:41:16.706]  We're like, dude, you should be in a mental ward, not running stuff.
[02:41:17.607 --> 02:41:24.392]  Your red carpets are carpets of blood running right over the edge into oblivion.
[02:41:26.914 --> 02:41:30.477]  And the metaphor, the allegory rings true.
[02:41:31.658 --> 02:41:38.284]  Just like Pennywise the clown is just an anglerfish's light hanging out front from the big spider.
[02:41:40.728 --> 02:41:41.608]  That's all you are.
[02:41:41.628 --> 02:41:44.530]  And then we see who would sell out to evil.
[02:41:44.610 --> 02:41:48.811]  They're these ugly, degenerate, filthy blobs.
[02:41:49.131 --> 02:41:51.212]  By the way, they just finished a video that Hollywood's dead.
[02:41:52.073 --> 02:41:52.773]  Remind me if that's ready.
[02:41:52.793 --> 02:41:54.154]  They told me it was ready almost 30 minutes ago.
[02:41:54.554 --> 02:41:55.314]  That is powerful.
[02:41:55.334 --> 02:41:56.194]  I want to air that here too.
[02:41:57.515 --> 02:42:01.477]  Just briefly, everything I do metaphysically must
[02:42:02.785 --> 02:42:04.806]  Give back as much energy as I receive.
[02:42:05.847 --> 02:42:06.147]  Okay?
[02:42:06.667 --> 02:42:07.928]  So, understand that.
[02:42:08.508 --> 02:42:11.750]  And that's just in the product itself, not in what we do on here.
[02:42:14.792 --> 02:42:24.138]  You've got my pledge to give you the best products at the best prices to be able to fund this operation to where we can get you high quality products from the operation and I can withstand the enemy's attacks.
[02:42:25.057 --> 02:42:28.701]  I need everybody to go to InfoWarsStore.com today and get Survival Shield X2.
[02:42:28.861 --> 02:42:30.383]  Oh, what a game changer.
[02:42:30.403 --> 02:42:31.063]  40% off.
[02:42:31.724 --> 02:42:33.306]  Bio-True Selenium, 40% off.
[02:42:33.766 --> 02:42:34.848]  Rainforest, 50% off.
[02:42:34.868 --> 02:42:35.548]  That's about to end.
[02:42:36.009 --> 02:42:38.752]  InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:42:38.812 --> 02:42:40.794]  And when you fund us, you have my...
[02:42:44.998 --> 02:42:50.022]  Sworn commitment to you, just like Donald Trump auditioned in front of you two years ago here on air.
[02:42:50.802 --> 02:42:52.163]  You will not be disappointed.
[02:42:52.323 --> 02:42:53.965]  I commit to you that I will do this.
[02:42:54.585 --> 02:42:58.148]  I am swearing to you my commitment that I need your financial support.
[02:42:58.508 --> 02:42:59.248]  I need your prayers.
[02:42:59.889 --> 02:43:00.890]  mfulworthstore.com.
[02:43:00.910 --> 02:43:01.310]  Do it now.
[02:43:02.371 --> 02:43:03.912]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running
[02:43:05.174 --> 02:43:10.497]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[02:43:10.757 --> 02:43:11.898]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[02:43:12.138 --> 02:43:14.439]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[02:43:15.120 --> 02:43:21.623]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[02:43:21.824 --> 02:43:25.165]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[02:43:25.486 --> 02:43:27.287]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[02:43:27.927 --> 02:43:36.357]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[02:43:36.377 --> 02:43:37.338]  They know how great it is.
[02:43:38.259 --> 02:43:42.003]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[02:43:42.844 --> 02:43:44.346]  Metropic means for the brain.
[02:43:45.147 --> 02:43:53.015]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[02:43:53.456 --> 02:43:59.262]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[02:44:04.488 --> 02:44:04.888]  That comes to $50.03.
[02:44:05.028 --> 02:44:09.072]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[02:44:09.492 --> 02:44:12.635]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[02:44:12.675 --> 02:44:13.615]  It's a good deal at $39.
[02:44:14.816 --> 02:44:15.537]  It's $19.96 at Infowarslife.com.
[02:44:22.122 --> 02:44:26.725]  Or simply call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:44:27.785 --> 02:44:41.614]  And when you purchase Brain Force Plus, or any of the other great products like Secret 12, Caveman, Oxy Powder, Super Mel Vitality, our fluoride-free, super blue, colloidal silver, and iodine-empowered toothpaste, you get...

[02:44:59.293 --> 02:45:02.276]  Again, that's infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:45:02.537 --> 02:45:20.335]  I want to just briefly thank listeners for their support of the broadcast and remind listeners that we are listener supported and it is your financial support getting good products in return that you need and that symbiotic relationship and that 360 win that makes everything here we do possible.
[02:45:21.056 --> 02:45:26.379]  And we're not just going to have to end the next week the Brain Force Plus special 50% off.
[02:45:26.739 --> 02:45:34.143]  I'm going to have to end even sooner our Caveman Ultimate Paleo Bone Broth Turmeric Chaga Mushroom Bee Pollen.
[02:45:35.180 --> 02:45:35.660]  And more.
[02:45:36.161 --> 02:45:36.781]  Concentrate.
[02:45:36.821 --> 02:45:38.602]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[02:45:38.863 --> 02:45:40.284]  Next level compared to whey.
[02:45:40.504 --> 02:45:42.145]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[02:45:42.545 --> 02:45:43.406]  It's incredible.
[02:45:43.886 --> 02:45:45.807]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[02:45:45.987 --> 02:45:47.128]  It's bigger than I am already.
[02:45:47.608 --> 02:45:48.489]  At 15, incredible.
[02:45:48.809 --> 02:45:49.710]  It is amazing.
[02:45:50.070 --> 02:45:51.771]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:45:52.112 --> 02:45:52.892]  50% off Caveman.
[02:45:53.112 --> 02:45:54.453]  But only a few days left.
[02:45:54.693 --> 02:45:55.434]  It's about to end.
[02:45:56.034 --> 02:45:58.375]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[02:45:58.815 --> 02:46:03.977]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[02:46:04.397 --> 02:46:05.798]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[02:46:06.038 --> 02:46:07.198]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[02:46:07.578 --> 02:46:08.399]  I want to thank you.
[02:46:08.719 --> 02:46:09.779]  We're all in this together.
[02:46:10.299 --> 02:46:20.183]  And when you get the great Bolan Labe t-shirts, and you get the great books and videos, and when you get the great water filtration, you help yourself, you help your family, when you get the great air filtration systems, all of them,
[02:46:20.923 --> 02:46:24.364]  On sale right now at InfoWarsLive.com, you're fighting the tip of the spear.
[02:46:24.584 --> 02:46:26.425]  But these specials have got to end.
[02:46:26.905 --> 02:46:36.328]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer Brain Force at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.
[02:46:36.588 --> 02:46:41.930]  But again, thank you all for your support because this helps fund our operation as we expand in the face of the globalists.
[02:46:42.430 --> 02:46:47.072]  Again, visit InfoWarsStore.com today and commit to helping the InfoWar.
[02:46:47.712 --> 02:46:55.376]  Funding the InfoWar is now more important than ever, and when you fund the InfoWar, you get incredible high-quality products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:46:55.716 --> 02:47:00.538]  That's 50% off Rainforest Plus, 50% off Caveman, but only for one week.
[02:47:05.240 --> 02:47:07.842]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:37.352 --> 02:47:37.973]  Welcome back.
[02:47:38.014 --> 02:47:39.216]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:47:39.337 --> 02:47:40.600]  Infowars.com.
[02:47:40.800 --> 02:47:43.046]  Newswars.com are the main sites of the Globalist.
[02:47:43.427 --> 02:47:44.429]  Hope you don't spread the links to.
[02:47:46.070 --> 02:47:53.437]  Coming up as we start the next hour, I'll hand the baton to Mike Cernovich with all his big breaking news, but I'll play a clip we put together entitled, Hollywood is Dead.
[02:47:53.457 --> 02:47:54.158]  Get ready for that.
[02:47:54.939 --> 02:47:55.619]  And there's more.
[02:47:55.739 --> 02:48:00.284]  But first off, Trump says, we're saying Merry Christmas again.
[02:48:00.304 --> 02:48:02.546]  This was at the Value Voters Summit.
[02:48:03.046 --> 02:48:05.729]  And this is a revolutionary act against the globalists.
[02:48:06.567 --> 02:48:08.188]  You know, that's just silly to say that.
[02:48:08.248 --> 02:48:17.854]  No, they want to take everything from you and make any culture you have bad, so you'll just lay down and say, whatever the newest download is, I will accept it.
[02:48:17.894 --> 02:48:29.402]  This is cult programming, and this is America and the world saying no, and that's all Trump's doing is saying it's okay to say Merry Christmas.
[02:48:29.422 --> 02:48:29.882]  Here it is.
[02:48:30.703 --> 02:48:32.744]  Again, as we approach the end of the year,
[02:48:33.942 --> 02:48:38.586]  You know, we're getting near that beautiful Christmas season that people don't talk about anymore.
[02:48:39.706 --> 02:48:43.549]  They don't use the word Christmas, because it's not politically correct.
[02:48:43.589 --> 02:48:49.334]  You go to department stores, and they'll say, Happy New Year, and they'll say other things, and it'll be red.
[02:48:49.394 --> 02:48:51.775]  They'll have it painted, but they don't say, well, guess what?
[02:48:52.656 --> 02:48:55.278]  We're saying Merry Christmas again.
[02:48:55.298 --> 02:48:57.720]  I mean, what a cult, man!
[02:48:58.140 --> 02:48:58.781]  It's our country.
[02:49:00.831 --> 02:49:02.031]  That means we have to even do this.
[02:49:02.852 --> 02:49:05.293]  What a group of pedophiles in Hollywood, the goodness.
[02:49:06.054 --> 02:49:06.754]  That's who runs this.
[02:49:07.675 --> 02:49:13.098]  Okay, that's the... I mean, literally, the pedophiles go, we can tell them not to have Christmas or say mom and dad, then we can sexualize their kids.
[02:49:13.178 --> 02:49:14.098]  Ah, they'll buy into it.
[02:49:14.138 --> 02:49:15.139]  Yeah, we'll get those kids.
[02:49:16.200 --> 02:49:16.900]  Let's continue.
[02:49:18.081 --> 02:49:20.002]  The American founders invoked our creator.
[02:49:20.062 --> 02:49:20.522]  You better.
[02:49:21.042 --> 02:49:23.444]  But how many times do you hear it now?
[02:49:23.524 --> 02:49:23.704]  No.
[02:49:24.524 --> 02:49:25.225]  Things have changed.
[02:49:26.285 --> 02:49:26.826]  But you know what?
[02:49:27.711 --> 02:49:29.272]  They're changing back again.
[02:49:29.292 --> 02:49:30.072]  Wow.
[02:49:30.532 --> 02:49:32.132]  You can say what you want about his policies.
[02:49:32.153 --> 02:49:33.153]  They're great overall.
[02:49:33.233 --> 02:49:34.753]  But this is the real power.
[02:49:35.254 --> 02:49:36.674]  Breaking the will of the globalists.
[02:49:37.034 --> 02:49:38.295]  It's why they hate him so much.
[02:49:38.755 --> 02:49:40.955]  This is Oxygen coming back in the room.
[02:49:40.995 --> 02:49:41.476]  Here it is.
[02:49:42.376 --> 02:49:54.140]  It's our faith and our values that inspires us to give with charity, to act with courage, and to sacrifice for what we know is right.
[02:49:55.407 --> 02:50:03.289]  The American founders invoked our creator four times in the Declaration of Independence.
[02:50:03.389 --> 02:50:04.190]  Four times.
[02:50:04.210 --> 02:50:05.210]  I invoke it now.
[02:50:05.230 --> 02:50:08.091]  I invoke it now.
[02:50:09.411 --> 02:50:10.392]  I need God's help!
[02:50:10.512 --> 02:50:12.672]  Times have changed, but you know what?
[02:50:12.852 --> 02:50:14.773]  Now they're changing back again.
[02:50:14.873 --> 02:50:15.633]  Just remember that.
[02:50:15.653 --> 02:50:16.554]  That's right.
[02:50:18.754 --> 02:50:19.194]  Powerful.
[02:50:20.415 --> 02:50:20.915]  Powerful.
[02:50:22.455 --> 02:50:24.236]  Simple things like this are powerful.
[02:50:29.178 --> 02:50:31.883]  There's no doubt now, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50:31.963 --> 02:50:33.927]  It's those, you think those simple things, they're not simple.
[02:50:34.007 --> 02:50:37.755]  The enemy is reeling, and everything they've done is falling right now.
[02:50:39.824 --> 02:50:41.004]  Let's go ahead and go to the next clip.
[02:50:41.104 --> 02:50:45.045]  We know that parents, not bureaucrats, know what's best, how to raise our children.
[02:50:45.065 --> 02:50:47.786]  Remember just MSNBC a few years ago?
[02:50:48.126 --> 02:50:49.326]  Your kids belong to the state.
[02:50:49.646 --> 02:50:52.267]  We got to get past this idea that kids belong to families.
[02:50:52.887 --> 02:50:54.527]  Well, let me tell you, when I got up at 2 a.m.
[02:50:54.547 --> 02:51:03.990]  this morning to take care of my baby daughter, at five months old, so my wife could sleep, and I was up giving her a bottle of milk for an hour and a half, till 3.30 in the morning.
[02:51:04.010 --> 02:51:05.670]  Let me tell you, it wasn't the state doing that.
[02:51:06.390 --> 02:51:07.250]  And I love doing it.
[02:51:07.270 --> 02:51:09.011]  And I had a special time with my daughter.
[02:51:10.103 --> 02:51:11.323]  I got back up at 6 a.m.
[02:51:11.343 --> 02:51:11.984]  to do it again!
[02:51:12.784 --> 02:51:13.984]  What sub-state did that?
[02:51:14.024 --> 02:51:17.305]  That's my daughter, my blood, my history, my future!
[02:51:18.386 --> 02:51:18.846]  Here it is.
[02:51:20.046 --> 02:51:29.369]  Bureaucrats think they can run your lives, overrule your values, meddle in your faith, and tell you how to live, what to say, and how to pray.
[02:51:30.209 --> 02:51:38.912]  But we know that parents, not bureaucrats, know best how to raise their children and create a thriving society.
[02:51:47.285 --> 02:51:53.030]  We know that faith and prayer, not federal regulation.
[02:51:54.171 --> 02:52:01.498]  And by the way, we are cutting regulations at a clip that nobody has ever seen before.
[02:52:01.518 --> 02:52:03.420]  Nobody.
[02:52:08.212 --> 02:52:16.214]  In nine months, we have cut more regulation than any president has cut during their term in office.
[02:52:16.234 --> 02:52:17.495]  It was all to destroy the country.
[02:52:17.575 --> 02:52:18.295]  We are doing the job.
[02:52:20.435 --> 02:52:22.376]  How we got so far down the line with these people.
[02:52:22.496 --> 02:52:24.476]  I mean, it's just like, get off our backs.
[02:52:24.496 --> 02:52:27.117]  You ever have somebody smothering you or like on top of you?
[02:52:27.857 --> 02:52:29.518]  It's like they're just, it's claustrophobic.
[02:52:29.538 --> 02:52:30.818]  Just get out of our lives!
[02:52:31.158 --> 02:52:32.219]  Go be scum!
[02:52:33.099 --> 02:52:33.699]  Go away!
[02:52:34.926 --> 02:52:35.846]  Don't get away!
[02:52:35.866 --> 02:52:37.727]  I don't even want to kill you!
[02:52:38.987 --> 02:52:44.989]  But I know in the end, I'm... You're not gonna go away, I know that.
[02:52:47.330 --> 02:52:50.110]  But when we get rid of you, it's gonna be like dumping dog crap in a bucket.
[02:52:50.811 --> 02:52:51.351]  In the trash.
[02:52:51.451 --> 02:52:53.511]  It's not like some big ceremony here.
[02:52:53.531 --> 02:52:55.112]  We're just getting you off our backs.
[02:52:57.389 --> 02:53:02.071]  As long as we have pride in our country, confidence in our future, and faith in our God, America will prevail.
[02:53:02.131 --> 02:53:03.311]  Again, what does that give us?
[02:53:03.391 --> 02:53:03.912]  No God.
[02:53:04.032 --> 02:53:04.392]  Nothing.
[02:53:04.652 --> 02:53:04.932]  Them.
[02:53:05.012 --> 02:53:05.532]  Hollywood.
[02:53:06.072 --> 02:53:06.573]  Exactly.
[02:53:07.133 --> 02:53:11.835]  Again, this is Trump engaging in a mass exorcism against the globalist Satanists.
[02:53:11.855 --> 02:53:12.235]  Here it is.
[02:53:12.975 --> 02:53:24.525]  The people who grace our lives and fill our homes and build our communities are the true strength of our nation and the greatest hope for a better tomorrow.
[02:53:25.345 --> 02:53:33.272]  As long as we have pride in our country, confidence in our future, and faith in our God,
[02:53:34.241 --> 02:53:37.084]  That America will prevail.
[02:53:37.104 --> 02:53:46.335]  We will defeat every evil, overcome every threat, and meet every single challenge.
[02:53:47.076 --> 02:53:48.517]  We will defend our faith.
[02:53:49.597 --> 02:53:51.639]  And protect our traditions.
[02:53:52.299 --> 02:53:56.863]  We will find the best in each other and in ourselves.
[02:53:57.603 --> 02:54:03.508]  We will pass on the blessings of liberty and the glories of God to our children.
[02:54:04.468 --> 02:54:06.190]  Our values will endure.
[02:54:06.830 --> 02:54:08.552]  Our nation will thrive.
[02:54:08.952 --> 02:54:11.214]  Our citizens will flourish.
[02:54:11.674 --> 02:54:14.436]  And our freedom will triumph.
[02:54:15.537 --> 02:54:18.139]  Thank you to the Value Voter Summit.
[02:54:19.793 --> 02:54:22.195]  Such an incredible group of people you are.
[02:54:22.315 --> 02:54:25.056]  Thank you to all of the faithful here today.
[02:54:25.877 --> 02:54:32.041]  And thank you to the people of faith all across our nation and all over the world.
[02:54:32.141 --> 02:54:33.242]  May God bless you.
[02:54:34.022 --> 02:54:37.304]  May God bless the United States of America.
[02:54:37.344 --> 02:54:38.605]  Thank you very much, everybody.
[02:54:38.925 --> 02:54:39.385]  Incredible.
[02:54:39.445 --> 02:54:40.226]  And what does that mean?
[02:54:40.246 --> 02:54:41.407]  It means we're not self-centered.
[02:54:41.427 --> 02:54:42.507]  We believe in something bigger.
[02:54:43.048 --> 02:54:44.749]  We're not a bunch of psychopathic jerks.
[02:54:46.270 --> 02:54:47.511]  We govern ourselves.
[02:54:48.493 --> 02:54:49.894]  We're not turned over to pure evil.
[02:54:50.254 --> 02:54:51.454]  This is so revolutionary.
[02:54:51.474 --> 02:54:54.856]  I should have started the whole broadcast with this today.
[02:54:54.876 --> 02:54:57.216]  I should get folks to know this stuff.
[02:54:59.677 --> 02:55:00.298]  Listen to this.
[02:55:00.358 --> 02:55:03.399]  In the last 10 months, we've followed through on one promise after another.
[02:55:05.220 --> 02:55:05.780]  It's true.
[02:55:05.840 --> 02:55:08.501]  Even stuff I didn't completely agree with, he's following through on.
[02:55:08.541 --> 02:55:10.842]  This is so revolutionary.
[02:55:11.202 --> 02:55:15.184]  Doing what you say you're going to do and not being duplicitous.
[02:55:15.344 --> 02:55:15.764]  Here it is.
[02:55:16.912 --> 02:55:22.475]  In the last 10 months, we have followed through on one promise after another.
[02:55:24.637 --> 02:55:32.682]  I didn't have a schedule, but if I did have a schedule, I would say we are substantially ahead of schedule.
[02:55:33.002 --> 02:55:33.222]  Yeah.
[02:55:34.243 --> 02:55:34.803]  Absolutely.
[02:55:34.843 --> 02:55:36.384]  Way better than I thought.
[02:55:38.607 --> 02:55:43.430]  Some of those promises are to support and defend the Constitution.
[02:55:44.190 --> 02:55:59.560]  I appointed and confirmed a Supreme Court Justice in the mold of the late, great Justice Antonin Scalia, the newest member of the Supreme Court, Justice Neil Gorsuch.
[02:56:16.087 --> 02:56:18.088]  Let's finish up with Trump on Puerto Rico.
[02:56:18.108 --> 02:56:18.988]  Here it is.
[02:56:20.488 --> 02:56:40.595]  We also stand with the millions of people who have suffered from the massive fires which are right now raging in California and the catastrophic hurricanes along the Gulf Coast in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and I will tell you I left Texas and I left Florida and I left Louisiana
[02:56:41.335 --> 02:56:45.897]  And I went to Puerto Rico and I met with the president of the Virgin Islands.
[02:56:46.778 --> 02:56:49.579]  These are people that are incredible people.
[02:56:49.619 --> 02:56:52.681]  They've suffered gravely and we'll be there.
[02:56:53.041 --> 02:56:53.741]  We're going to be there.
[02:56:53.902 --> 02:56:57.463]  We have really, it's not even a question of a choice.
[02:56:58.024 --> 02:56:59.104]  We don't even want a choice.
[02:56:59.124 --> 02:57:03.026]  We're going to be there as Americans and we love those people and what they've gone through.
[02:57:03.606 --> 02:57:04.387]  And they're all healing.
[02:57:05.087 --> 02:57:09.188]  And their states and territories are healing, and they're healing rapidly.
[02:57:09.789 --> 02:57:18.992]  In the wake of the terrible tragedies of the past several weeks, the American people have responded with goodness and generosity and bravery.
[02:57:19.032 --> 02:57:19.592]  You've seen it.
[02:57:20.412 --> 02:57:27.495]  The heroism of everyday citizens reminds us that the true strength of our nation is found in the hearts and souls of our people.
[02:57:28.415 --> 02:57:34.277]  When America is unified, no force on Earth can break us apart.
[02:57:37.056 --> 02:57:38.397]  I got a special video coming up.
[02:57:39.597 --> 02:57:42.658]  Dennis Hastert has now, the convicted pedophile, come out against Trump.
[02:57:43.259 --> 02:57:44.339]  You can't make a joke out of this.
[02:57:44.359 --> 02:57:45.260]  It's like Brian Williams.
[02:57:45.360 --> 02:57:48.681]  It's like, what new mummy will they pull out of a crypt to throw against us?
[02:57:48.761 --> 02:57:50.342]  I mean, this is who we're fighting?
[02:57:52.640 --> 02:58:01.645]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:58:01.725 --> 02:58:09.970]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:58:10.150 --> 02:58:14.852]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:58:15.032 --> 02:58:18.674]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee

[03:00:17.754 --> 03:00:22.778]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:28.103 --> 03:00:30.585]  Hollywood!
[03:00:31.546 --> 03:00:33.067]  Babylon!
[03:00:33.167 --> 03:00:34.949]  Babylon!
[03:00:45.985 --> 03:00:47.747]  InfoWars.com right now.
[03:00:48.608 --> 03:00:50.331]  Coffin nails the enemy if you get it out.
[03:00:51.872 --> 03:00:58.921]  We dump so much vicious truth on the enemy, I... I can't even handle it myself, quite frankly.
[03:01:00.263 --> 03:01:04.248]  Right in the center of the storm, the fulcrum, only God keeps me in position.
[03:01:05.512 --> 03:01:08.653]  I'm very humble, my friends, because you should be humble as well.
[03:01:09.293 --> 03:01:11.674]  Consciousness and existence is something very special.
[03:01:12.034 --> 03:01:26.638]  You should thank God every day you're not Dennis Hastert that liked to recruit 10, 11, 12-year-old boys so you could have sex with them and deliver them to a bunch of filthy Republican and Democrat donors in their sick club of ruining young men.
[03:01:26.658 --> 03:01:29.679]  I don't get it.
[03:01:31.420 --> 03:01:36.145]  Like, as a man, I'm attracted to the most powerful, aggressive, caveman women.
[03:01:37.186 --> 03:01:39.868]  But, see, wimps want a little girl or a little boy.
[03:01:39.928 --> 03:01:42.711]  That makes them feel... They're in charge now.
[03:01:42.731 --> 03:01:49.618]  They're not the kind of person that, like, wants to, like, be, you know, wow, look at this woman, or if you're a woman, look at this big, strong man.
[03:01:50.158 --> 03:01:54.342]  They're into the defiling, you see.
[03:01:54.382 --> 03:01:55.443]  That's what Satanism is.
[03:01:56.391 --> 03:01:59.952]  Newsweek uses accused pedophile Dennis Hastert to attack Trump.
[03:02:00.353 --> 03:02:00.973]  Why not?
[03:02:01.133 --> 03:02:03.334]  You got Brian Williams back from the dead.
[03:02:03.594 --> 03:02:10.336]  Say he was shot down in a helicopter and, you know, won 15 Super Bowls or whatever.
[03:02:10.416 --> 03:02:12.217]  I mean, why not make up more lies?
[03:02:13.738 --> 03:02:15.978]  They've dug up Hastert to criticize Trump.
[03:02:16.339 --> 03:02:18.539]  Like, hey, pedophile Hastert doesn't like Trump.
[03:02:18.960 --> 03:02:22.541]  Oh boy, Trump's in trouble with enemies like this.
[03:02:24.721 --> 03:02:25.481]  Who needs friends?
[03:02:26.422 --> 03:02:36.107]  But here's a piece Mr. Gonzalez and Mr. McBrain put together, titled amply, Hollywood is Dead.
[03:02:36.868 --> 03:02:37.228]  Here it is.
[03:03:09.188 --> 03:03:10.289]  Intensity's heightened.
[03:03:11.249 --> 03:03:11.969]  He's a punk.
[03:03:12.610 --> 03:03:13.350]  He's a dog.
[03:03:13.550 --> 03:03:14.911]  I'd like to punch him in the face.
[03:03:15.892 --> 03:03:16.892]  Tensions are rising.
[03:03:31.898 --> 03:03:33.139]  I don't know.
[03:03:47.094 --> 03:03:51.799]  Donald Trump, just last week, he confirmed to the National Review that he is again considering a run in 2016.
[03:03:51.859 --> 03:03:52.759]  Do it.
[03:03:53.140 --> 03:03:53.620]  Do it.
[03:03:55.182 --> 03:03:56.323]  Look at me.
[03:03:56.343 --> 03:03:57.784]  Do it.
[03:03:57.884 --> 03:04:08.394]  I will personally write you a campaign check now on behalf of this country, which does not want you to be president, but which badly wants you to run.
[03:04:12.296 --> 03:04:19.380]  Donald J. Trump will become the 45th president of the United States, defeating Hillary Clinton in a campaign.
[03:04:24.263 --> 03:04:25.384]  Well, you want to bang heads?
[03:04:27.305 --> 03:04:27.745]  We're doing it.
[03:04:29.026 --> 03:04:29.546]  This is it.
[03:04:30.947 --> 03:04:41.293]  And, uh, when you Satanists figure out you were only there to test us, the faithful, by then you'll be falling down to that
[03:04:43.137 --> 03:04:45.538]  The core of that star will be bound for eternity.
[03:04:46.279 --> 03:04:49.580]  Until it blows up into a new eternity.
[03:04:50.961 --> 03:04:52.481]  So get ready for the Phantom Zone.
[03:04:54.262 --> 03:04:55.343]  Because that's where you're going.
[03:04:56.543 --> 03:04:58.444]  Mike Cernovich is coming up on the other side.
[03:04:58.464 --> 03:04:59.125]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:04:59.725 --> 03:05:00.825]  This is The Infowar.
[03:05:03.669 --> 03:05:07.873]  Men, give your body the support it needs with InfoWars Life Prostagard.
[03:05:08.413 --> 03:05:12.276]  It's time to start assisting the body in regulating proper prostate balance.

[03:06:13.751 --> 03:06:14.871]  Well, so does he.
[03:06:15.591 --> 03:06:20.332]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:21.485 --> 03:06:22.866]  We shouldn't be too confident.
[03:06:24.347 --> 03:06:25.607]  We've woken up from the trance.
[03:06:26.888 --> 03:06:28.449]  You see the vampires all around us.
[03:06:29.489 --> 03:06:31.290]  The question is, where is the path forward?
[03:06:32.051 --> 03:06:35.273]  The NFL, the whole MSM combine, Hollywood is collapsing.
[03:06:35.693 --> 03:06:38.634]  Like Steven Spielberg predicted four years ago.
[03:06:39.215 --> 03:06:44.758]  Hastert has come out, like Ryan Williams, the discredited molester of the truth.
[03:06:45.678 --> 03:06:48.400]  And is attacking Trump and they're celebrating Hastert.
[03:06:48.820 --> 03:06:57.425]  They are entering into total mental illness like the governor of California legalizing giving people AIDS or giving blood with HIV or hepatitis.
[03:06:57.525 --> 03:06:59.566]  It's like a ghost dance.
[03:07:00.066 --> 03:07:04.049]  Now I'm going to leave because I want Cernovich to host himself because I was listening and watching.
[03:07:04.549 --> 03:07:08.491]  But Mike Cernovich, what do you make of the point we've reached right now?
[03:07:08.551 --> 03:07:11.233]  I mean, things are moving quicker than we even envisioned.
[03:07:12.708 --> 03:07:16.330]  Well, you know, actually, we talked about that when this story first broke.
[03:07:17.311 --> 03:07:22.254]  We said two things, and one has come true, we're waiting for the second to come true.
[03:07:22.294 --> 03:07:24.575]  You said it's not just grabbing women, it's raping women.
[03:07:25.395 --> 03:07:25.876]  Exactly.
[03:07:26.356 --> 03:07:33.580]  And then two is we said this is all a cover to give the public a distraction to prevent people from learning about Hollywood pedophiles.
[03:07:34.120 --> 03:07:35.521]  So that's the next shoe to drop.
[03:07:36.722 --> 03:07:39.143]  Well, take over, my friend, because you're on target.
[03:07:39.303 --> 03:07:39.904]  Mike Cernovich.
[03:07:40.928 --> 03:07:57.234]  So yeah, that's what Alex and I talked about is we said, look, this Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment allegation was just one thing that was going to find, we said, we guarantee that he'll be charged with rape or accused of rape rather by other people.
[03:07:58.495 --> 03:08:05.698]  And then the story broke that there is now an open rape investigation in Great Britain for Harvey Weinstein.
[03:08:06.038 --> 03:08:06.998]  Big problem right there.
[03:08:07.538 --> 03:08:08.599]  But the bigger picture,
[03:08:10.103 --> 03:08:31.606]  is why now that's what Alex and I talked about right when the story broke we got on right then and there and Alex goes why now Cernovich why now and I said the pedophile stuff was about to break and they knew the pedophile stuff was about to break so they go well let's just give them Harvey Weinstein because isn't it amazing
[03:08:33.280 --> 03:08:34.641]  How they all went after him at once.
[03:08:34.881 --> 03:08:42.465]  Almost like they, it's almost like everybody in media in Hollywood and every industry said, Hey, let's all go after Harvey.
[03:08:42.865 --> 03:08:44.286]  Let's all attack him at once.
[03:08:44.406 --> 03:08:45.466]  Why, why did they do that?
[03:08:46.427 --> 03:08:48.968]  Well, because then they'll say, well, we're cleaning up the industry.
[03:08:48.988 --> 03:08:55.552]  We're taking things back, but really this is about pedophilia and the Hollywood pedophiles being exposed.
[03:08:56.332 --> 03:08:57.473]  This is really about.
[03:08:58.510 --> 03:09:09.236]  The Infowarriors, and the people who listen to this show, who have been calling out the pedophilia and the degeneracy in Hollywood for decades, and who's a conspiracy theory now?
[03:09:10.376 --> 03:09:10.616]  Right?
[03:09:11.657 --> 03:09:15.939]  That's my question, is who is the conspiracy theory now?
[03:09:16.940 --> 03:09:26.985]  The people on Infowarriors, Alex Jones, people, I didn't even know about Alex Jones five years ago, he was doing amazing work calling out the pedophilia in Hollywood, and they said, oh, that's a conspiracy theory.
[03:09:28.177 --> 03:09:36.426]  So there's an amazing video that's going to touch into this point now, that Corey Feldman, a very brave man, had resurfaced now.
[03:09:36.486 --> 03:09:42.292]  Because remember, when I was growing up, I'm 39, the two Corey's were the big deal.
[03:09:42.933 --> 03:09:44.515]  Corey Feldman and Corey Haim.
[03:09:46.056 --> 03:09:47.217]  We're in every film together.
[03:09:47.417 --> 03:09:48.358]  They're two Corys.
[03:09:48.438 --> 03:09:50.079]  They were the coolest kids growing up.
[03:09:50.559 --> 03:09:52.821]  Corey Feldman, of course, was in Goonies.
[03:09:52.861 --> 03:09:53.941]  They were great.
[03:09:54.382 --> 03:09:58.845]  And then it turns out that Corey Hain became a drug addict and killed himself and people said, why?
[03:09:58.865 --> 03:10:03.048]  Well, because he was molested by Hollywood pedophiles.
[03:10:03.208 --> 03:10:08.071]  And Corey Feldman on Barbara Walters tries to confront the pedophilia issue.
[03:10:08.911 --> 03:10:12.354]  And let's listen to what Barbara Walters tells a victim of pedophiles.
[03:10:13.638 --> 03:10:22.966]  I'm saying that there are people that were the people that did this to both me and Corey that are still working, they're still out there, and they're some of the richest, most powerful people in this business.
[03:10:23.186 --> 03:10:25.948]  And they do not want me saying what I'm saying right now.
[03:10:26.869 --> 03:10:28.410]  Are you saying that they're pedophiles?
[03:10:28.490 --> 03:10:28.850]  Yes.
[03:10:29.211 --> 03:10:30.552]  And that they're still in this business?
[03:10:30.572 --> 03:10:30.772]  Yes.
[03:10:31.132 --> 03:10:32.813]  And that's what you're saying in your book.
[03:10:32.873 --> 03:10:41.938]  When you talk to parents, Corey, there are a lot of parents out here who want to put their kids in this business.
[03:10:42.458 --> 03:10:44.059]  Their kids are cute, they're great actors.
[03:10:44.919 --> 03:10:48.921]  What would you say to a parent who just has the best of intentions who's coming here with their child?
[03:10:49.421 --> 03:10:52.363]  If you're saying that there's a lot of predators in this industry.
[03:10:52.523 --> 03:10:54.684]  It's a many-feathered bird, okay?
[03:10:55.024 --> 03:10:56.284]  Be careful what you wish for.
[03:10:56.684 --> 03:10:57.604]  That's what I'll tell you.
[03:10:57.885 --> 03:10:59.525]  You know, don't go into it with naivety.
[03:10:59.625 --> 03:11:02.486]  Don't go into it thinking that it's all roses and sunglasses and all that.
[03:11:02.526 --> 03:11:04.146]  You're damaging an entire industry.
[03:11:04.166 --> 03:11:05.907]  I'm sorry, I'm not trying to.
[03:11:05.967 --> 03:11:09.208]  I'm just trying to say that it's a very important, serious topic.
[03:11:09.248 --> 03:11:13.269]  You said that there was one gentleman in the industry who did not take advantage of you.
[03:11:13.709 --> 03:11:14.689]  He was not a pedophile.
[03:11:14.729 --> 03:11:16.150]  You said it was Michael Jackson.
[03:11:16.170 --> 03:11:16.550]  Of all people!
[03:11:18.678 --> 03:11:22.239]  You're damaging an entire industry.
[03:11:22.760 --> 03:11:31.643]  Barbara Walters, we can now confirm, is a pedophile apologist, just like Meryl Streep, who got up and- She's a pedophile collaborator.
[03:11:32.446 --> 03:11:33.186]  No question.
[03:11:33.386 --> 03:11:38.848]  I mean, that video is, that should be on every news network tonight.
[03:11:39.008 --> 03:11:46.210]  That should be the biggest story of the weekend is Barbara Walters is a pedophile enabler, collaborator, apologist, supporter.
[03:11:46.690 --> 03:11:53.872]  There's no language that can be too strong to describe that clip where she's literally shaming a victim of pedophilia.
[03:11:53.892 --> 03:11:57.013]  Well, how dare you go after an entire industry?
[03:11:57.719 --> 03:12:00.081]  And then people wonder why these kids are afraid to come forward.
[03:12:00.441 --> 03:12:07.547]  There had been, of course, other people tweeting out, Terry Crews had been sexually assaulted by a male producer.
[03:12:07.567 --> 03:12:08.848]  Terry Crews, of course, 240 pounds.
[03:12:08.868 --> 03:12:13.752]  I don't know if you missed it, but I want to just tell the story back when I was doing stuff in Hollywood.
[03:12:13.772 --> 03:12:17.095]  At the end of the meeting, these old producers would just grab you.
[03:12:17.415 --> 03:12:18.816]  It was like an act of domination.
[03:12:20.217 --> 03:12:24.221]  Yeah, a friend of mine who's a bodybuilder, that's actually why he left Hollywood, because
[03:12:25.197 --> 03:12:32.343]  They told him, he went into a shot and they said, you get on your knees and he was like, ah, they go, no, get the F, you know, on your knees.
[03:12:32.883 --> 03:12:34.364]  And he was like, what are you talking about?
[03:12:34.845 --> 03:12:43.111]  And he found out that pretty much 90% of every male superstar has performed fellatio and other, um, denigrated sex acts.
[03:12:43.131 --> 03:12:45.333]  That's why it's not about sex, Gary.
[03:12:45.373 --> 03:12:46.414]  It's about power.
[03:12:47.334 --> 03:12:47.554]  Right.
[03:12:47.975 --> 03:12:49.316]  And that's why many of them,
[03:12:50.365 --> 03:12:51.525]  Will not come forward.
[03:12:51.785 --> 03:12:54.366]  I mean, Jimmy Kimmel, what is Jimmy Kimmel hiding?
[03:12:54.866 --> 03:13:03.589]  He said, in a story today, he goes, well, the reason, you know, I didn't make Harvey Weinstein jokes is because it's not my job to talk about politics.
[03:13:03.669 --> 03:13:06.570]  It's not my job to call things out.
[03:13:06.590 --> 03:13:07.410]  No, let's be serious.
[03:13:07.450 --> 03:13:11.692]  The question is, has Jimmy Kimmel performed fellatio on Mr. Weinstein?
[03:13:12.732 --> 03:13:15.173]  And does Weinstein have pictures of that?
[03:13:15.873 --> 03:13:18.034]  That's like another big issue here.
[03:13:18.114 --> 03:13:19.274]  So yeah, Jimmy Kimmel says,
[03:13:20.026 --> 03:13:27.773]  I'm not the moral conscience of America, but wait a minute, Brian Spelter of CNN actually called him America's conscience, right?
[03:13:28.293 --> 03:13:36.000]  So, Jimmy Kimmel wants to talk about healthcare, tell people who support the Second Amendment that we hate America, that we want people to die.
[03:13:36.620 --> 03:13:42.829]  Oh, he's America's conscience then, but when it comes to a softball, this isn't, it doesn't take any moral courage now.
[03:13:43.850 --> 03:13:47.636]  Two weeks ago, to call out Harvey Weinstein, that took great courage.
[03:13:48.136 --> 03:13:52.783]  That took tremendous courage to call him out because he was the most powerful man in Hollywood two weeks ago.
[03:13:53.403 --> 03:13:55.564]  Today, it doesn't take any courage.
[03:13:55.864 --> 03:14:00.285]  So Kimmel doesn't even have that moral courage now.
[03:14:00.585 --> 03:14:03.326]  So the reason is, well, why does he talk about all these political issues?
[03:14:03.686 --> 03:14:13.749]  Well, I bet you that there are pictures of him performing sexual acts on Harvey Weinstein, and he doesn't want those films to get out and the pictures to get out and everything.
[03:14:13.769 --> 03:14:21.011]  And what he needs to do is come forward and just admit that he had been molested by Harvey Weinstein, just as many other male actors did.
[03:14:21.751 --> 03:14:25.152]  And do a great thing for America, do a great thing for the industry.
[03:14:25.933 --> 03:14:29.334]  But he's not going to do it because he doesn't have any moral courage.
[03:14:29.354 --> 03:14:30.935]  None of these people in Hollywood do.
[03:14:31.475 --> 03:14:33.335]  They're all, they knew about this for decades.
[03:14:33.375 --> 03:14:34.136]  They're all degenerates.
[03:14:34.236 --> 03:14:35.896]  I could have sold my soul and gone to Hollywood.
[03:14:36.377 --> 03:14:37.537]  Alex could have sold his soul.
[03:14:38.357 --> 03:14:42.559]  The friend of mine who didn't want to perform oral sex during a casting call could have.
[03:14:43.550 --> 03:14:46.853]  But we didn't want to, but we knew that that was the practice.
[03:14:46.893 --> 03:14:50.476]  So it was almost like when they say, well, Poison talked about it.
[03:14:50.536 --> 03:14:57.282]  I mean, not to get too corny on people, but there was even a song, A Fallen Angel, by a glam artist.
[03:14:58.163 --> 03:14:59.224]  Poison was the group.
[03:14:59.304 --> 03:15:01.906]  I forget who the lead singer was or whatever.
[03:15:02.306 --> 03:15:03.627]  Bret Michaels or something like that.
[03:15:03.647 --> 03:15:09.312]  But the whole video is about a young girl comes from the Midwest and she goes into L.A.
[03:15:09.332 --> 03:15:11.054]  and just wants to be a starlet and everything.
[03:15:11.754 --> 03:15:14.916]  And then she's immediately corrupted and taken over.
[03:15:16.137 --> 03:15:17.817]  And now they want to do that to America.
[03:15:17.897 --> 03:15:20.399]  Mike Cernovich coming up will break it all down.
[03:15:20.719 --> 03:15:25.081]  Hollywood seduction and gang rape of America now coming to an end.
[03:15:25.562 --> 03:15:26.542]  NFL collapsing.
[03:15:27.062 --> 03:15:28.903]  Trump re-invoking God in America.
[03:15:29.204 --> 03:15:30.424]  What does this signify?
[03:15:30.444 --> 03:15:33.286]  A great turning straight ahead as Mike Cernovich hosts.
[03:15:33.846 --> 03:15:35.829]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.

[03:15:40.776 --> 03:15:44.822]  It's a revolutionary act against the giant pot-bellied pedophile armies.
[03:15:45.323 --> 03:15:46.204]  Yes, it's happening.

[03:18:36.227 --> 03:18:36.848]  Concentrate.
[03:18:36.888 --> 03:18:38.669]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[03:18:38.930 --> 03:18:40.351]  Next level compared to whey.
[03:18:40.371 --> 03:18:42.213]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[03:18:42.613 --> 03:18:43.494]  It's incredible.
[03:18:43.974 --> 03:18:45.876]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[03:18:46.056 --> 03:18:47.217]  It's bigger than I am already.
[03:18:47.678 --> 03:18:48.578]  At 15, incredible.
[03:18:48.899 --> 03:18:49.779]  It is amazing.
[03:18:50.140 --> 03:18:51.841]  Infowarslife.com.

[03:18:56.105 --> 03:18:58.447]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[03:18:58.887 --> 03:19:04.052]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[03:19:04.472 --> 03:19:05.873]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[03:19:06.113 --> 03:19:07.274]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[03:19:07.654 --> 03:19:08.475]  I want to thank you.
[03:19:08.795 --> 03:19:09.856]  We're all in this together.

[03:20:05.821 --> 03:20:08.464]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:24.286 --> 03:20:38.670]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:38.710 --> 03:20:39.770]  We have a lot to talk about.
[03:20:40.291 --> 03:20:44.472]  Hollywood pedophilia is, of course, imploding, which is a fantastic thing.
[03:20:44.532 --> 03:20:45.732]  It's taking far too long.
[03:20:46.072 --> 03:20:51.554]  I mean, if you can see over me the picture over the head, actually, that was great artwork.
[03:20:52.174 --> 03:21:07.229]  That a fan of Infowars, a fellow Infowarrior, because everybody listening is part of the Infowar, had drawn, and you can see there George Soros, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, the Pope, Trigglypuff, all of these sort of wonderful people.
[03:21:07.429 --> 03:21:11.093]  We need to have him add Harvey Weinstein to that.
[03:21:11.534 --> 03:21:12.795]  Harvey Weinstein definitely
[03:21:13.522 --> 03:21:14.443]  Belongs in that.
[03:21:15.023 --> 03:21:17.784]  But the picture, you can see the Young Turks back there, too.
[03:21:17.844 --> 03:21:20.386]  And then the top, you have the heroes.
[03:21:20.946 --> 03:21:29.431]  You have, of course, the Roger Stones, who Congress is trying to bankrupt and ruin by giving him frivolous subpoenas and going after him in frivolous ways.
[03:21:30.211 --> 03:21:33.873]  You have Alex Jones, Matt Drudge, all the great freedom fighters.
[03:21:34.093 --> 03:21:40.997]  And that's why I brought this out for today's episode, because this is a reminder of the war.
[03:21:41.716 --> 03:21:44.918]  And who are on the good guys and who are on the bad guy side?
[03:21:45.558 --> 03:21:55.164]  And there's no question that Zuckerberg and Hillary and Weinstein and Soros and Obama, I think we need Weinstein like right there.
[03:21:56.524 --> 03:21:59.866]  Matt Damon, Ben Affleck belong in there too.
[03:21:59.906 --> 03:22:05.909]  There was a lot of pictures circulating showing Bill Clinton, Weinstein, Matt Damon, Affleck.
[03:22:05.929 --> 03:22:07.150]  They're all just partying.
[03:22:07.310 --> 03:22:10.172]  And then you wonder what happened?
[03:22:10.908 --> 03:22:14.530]  When those public pictures were gone, what happened when the lights went out?
[03:22:14.830 --> 03:22:16.891]  Were they bringing in underage prostitutes?
[03:22:16.911 --> 03:22:17.371]  Who knows?
[03:22:18.612 --> 03:22:28.537]  What we do know is that although Weinstein is getting a lot of coverage, what happened to Senator Robert Menendez's bribery trial coverage?
[03:22:29.618 --> 03:22:32.800]  According to the federal prosecutors, he had
[03:22:34.528 --> 03:22:37.549]  been involved with underage prostitutes.
[03:22:37.869 --> 03:22:42.431]  So it doesn't even, you can't even call them underage prostitutes because they're, they're sex slaves.
[03:22:42.871 --> 03:22:47.732]  A 15 year old girl isn't an underage, I hate that term actually, and I need to stop using it.
[03:22:48.252 --> 03:22:50.733]  A 15 year old girl isn't an underage prostitute.
[03:22:51.313 --> 03:22:52.334]  She's a sex slave, right?
[03:22:53.074 --> 03:22:56.335]  So even when the media reports on it, they kind of standardize it.
[03:22:56.455 --> 03:22:57.896]  Oh, it's an underage prostitute.
[03:22:58.276 --> 03:22:59.696]  No, but it isn't a free will.
[03:22:59.716 --> 03:23:00.696]  It isn't a free choice.
[03:23:00.736 --> 03:23:02.277]  And ain't, you know, if you're a free person,
[03:23:04.211 --> 03:23:07.512]  18, 19, 20, then you can be one, but you can't as a child, right?
[03:23:08.573 --> 03:23:15.235]  So where is the saturation media coverage on Bob Menendez?
[03:23:15.895 --> 03:23:17.916]  Why is the media not covering up this story?
[03:23:18.917 --> 03:23:25.479]  In fact, I found a 2014 article from the Huffington Post where they called out the Daily Caller
[03:23:26.300 --> 03:23:35.469]  For reporting about the sex trafficking allegations, Huffington Post said, how dare you, Daily Caller, smear Bob Menendez?
[03:23:36.010 --> 03:23:37.071]  Does that sound familiar?
[03:23:38.652 --> 03:23:46.760]  Well, it sounds an awful lot like Barbara Walters when she told Corey Feldman, you're attacking an entire industry by reporting on pedophiles.
[03:23:47.120 --> 03:23:47.761]  How dare you?
[03:23:48.590 --> 03:23:54.071]  How dare you smear an honorable senator who happens to like child sex slaves?
[03:23:54.311 --> 03:23:55.632]  How dare you, Daily Caller?
[03:23:56.272 --> 03:23:56.872]  You're bad.
[03:23:56.892 --> 03:23:58.532]  This is like another smear job.
[03:23:59.432 --> 03:24:05.194]  But meanwhile, if you're a conservative and you ever tweet anything that they don't like, that becomes kind of a big story.
[03:24:06.234 --> 03:24:06.974]  And that's where we're at.
[03:24:06.994 --> 03:24:07.854]  That's where we're all the day.
[03:24:07.874 --> 03:24:10.335]  And that's why they're so afraid.
[03:24:10.975 --> 03:24:15.616]  That is why they're trying to say, like a child in a romance,
[03:24:16.827 --> 03:24:19.590]  I break up with you as a person who's trying to break up with them.
[03:24:20.110 --> 03:24:21.211]  You can't fire me.
[03:24:21.291 --> 03:24:21.812]  I quit.
[03:24:21.972 --> 03:24:30.239]  So Seth Meyers, for example, copying Eminem said on his show, if you like Trump, I'm going to dump you.
[03:24:30.599 --> 03:24:31.320]  Something like that.
[03:24:31.340 --> 03:24:32.120]  The Hollywood Reporter.
[03:24:32.161 --> 03:24:32.301]  Yeah.
[03:24:32.621 --> 03:24:36.584]  My name is Seth and I'm here to say, if you like Trump, then go away.
[03:24:37.245 --> 03:24:41.609]  Seth Meyers, a pedophile enabler, a rape enabler.
[03:24:42.857 --> 03:24:44.337]  Is upset with middle America?
[03:24:44.377 --> 03:24:45.518]  See, he's not upset.
[03:24:45.578 --> 03:24:49.999]  This is what people have to understand when we're talking about the left.
[03:24:50.779 --> 03:24:53.439]  He isn't mad at you.
[03:24:54.640 --> 03:25:04.882]  In his own mind, he now realizes that all of his pedophile friends and all of his sex trafficking friends and all of his dirty friends are getting caught.
[03:25:05.362 --> 03:25:06.462]  And maybe he's involved.
[03:25:06.542 --> 03:25:08.182]  Maybe he only knows and looks the other way.
[03:25:08.222 --> 03:25:10.363]  You know, we don't really know exactly what's going on with him.
[03:25:11.536 --> 03:25:14.377]  But we do know that, why are you worried about Trump voters, bro?
[03:25:14.718 --> 03:25:16.999]  Now is not the time to worry about Trump voters.
[03:25:17.499 --> 03:25:33.686]  When your own industry is being revealed to be nothing but a bunch of pedophiles and rapists and sex traffickers and people who want to destroy the lives of others and make heterosexual men submit to them for power, pleasure and revenge porn industry.
[03:25:34.047 --> 03:25:35.947]  Now's not the time to call out Trump, right?
[03:25:35.967 --> 03:25:36.908]  It's an issue of,
[03:25:38.503 --> 03:25:39.925]  Optics, emotional intelligence.
[03:25:39.945 --> 03:25:42.247]  People say that Hollywood, there are moral superiors.
[03:25:42.667 --> 03:25:43.408]  There are betters.
[03:25:43.428 --> 03:25:44.488]  They know so much.
[03:25:44.889 --> 03:25:49.172]  Well, if they know so much, why would they be attacking Trump supporters now?
[03:25:49.212 --> 03:25:51.174]  Well, because they're trying to change the subject.
[03:25:52.475 --> 03:25:57.059]  They are mad that the game is up for them, that everybody knows now.
[03:25:57.519 --> 03:26:02.744]  And then when people watch a film, are you going to be able to suspend disbelief?
[03:26:03.304 --> 03:26:06.227]  Are you going to be able to be immersed in the fantasy of the film?
[03:26:07.142 --> 03:26:13.725]  Or are you going to say, hmm, I wonder if that actor helped Harvey Weinstein procure women.
[03:26:14.206 --> 03:26:19.468]  I wonder if that actor had to perform sexual favors for Harvey Weinstein and for other people.
[03:26:20.049 --> 03:26:23.270]  I wonder what the casting couch was like for that person, right?
[03:26:24.051 --> 03:26:26.832]  That's what people are going to be thinking now, rather than watching the films.
[03:26:26.912 --> 03:26:28.433]  And these people in the industry know it.
[03:26:29.093 --> 03:26:29.974]  They're freaking out.
[03:26:30.794 --> 03:26:33.195]  And it's stuff that we've been talking about for decades.
[03:26:33.556 --> 03:26:35.036]  Anthony Napoleon's talked about it.
[03:26:35.156 --> 03:26:36.077]  Alex has talked about it.
[03:26:37.330 --> 03:26:41.751]  Mark Dice has talked about it, Paul Joseph Lawson has talked about it, Stefan Molyneux has talked about it.
[03:26:42.271 --> 03:26:44.972]  There was even during the election, Donald Trump Jr.
[03:26:46.152 --> 03:26:47.852]  had tweeted out an article about this.
[03:26:49.373 --> 03:26:51.493]  Maria Brombeck had talked about it.
[03:26:52.553 --> 03:26:57.794]  Yes, Emma Thompson says, Harvey Weinstein sex abuse allegations are just the tip of the iceberg.
[03:26:58.254 --> 03:27:05.536]  And do we have the picture of Weinstein grabbing Hermione by the arms and pinning her arms and like dragging her into a limo?
[03:27:06.269 --> 03:27:09.111]  This is what they were doing in public.
[03:27:09.131 --> 03:27:13.653]  I forget what her name is, Emma Watson maybe, but she was one of the Harry Potter people.
[03:27:14.053 --> 03:27:15.274]  And funny enough, J.K.
[03:27:15.314 --> 03:27:29.582]  Rowling, who has an opinion on everything, hasn't commented about Harvey Weinstein grabbing a beloved Harry Potter character, pinning her arms behind her back, dragging her into a limousine.
[03:27:29.762 --> 03:27:31.643]  And then of course there was another picture of
[03:27:32.466 --> 03:27:35.827]  Weinstein like pawing at this girl who's sitting next to Oprah Winfrey.
[03:27:36.407 --> 03:27:47.510]  I mean, the depravity, the depravity that we're dealing with is at such a level that if you, yeah, Harvey Weinstein, you can see pulling on Hermione, he has her pinned his own head.
[03:27:47.570 --> 03:27:50.991]  He looks like he's in some kind of weird, like episodic trance.
[03:27:51.031 --> 03:27:54.572]  I don't know what kind of drugs he's on or if he's just drunk with power.
[03:27:55.501 --> 03:27:56.382]  What he's doing.
[03:27:56.422 --> 03:27:58.423]  And you can see how uncomfortable she looks in her.
[03:27:58.963 --> 03:28:00.044]  What is going on there?
[03:28:00.104 --> 03:28:02.906]  And then there are other pictures where he's kind of shoving her into a limo.
[03:28:02.926 --> 03:28:04.007]  I don't know.
[03:28:04.047 --> 03:28:04.867]  Is she on drugs?
[03:28:04.907 --> 03:28:05.788]  Has she been drugged?
[03:28:06.649 --> 03:28:07.009]  I don't know.
[03:28:07.029 --> 03:28:08.750]  But we need to do more of an investigation.
[03:28:09.571 --> 03:28:13.313]  Because remember, NBC killed this investigation.
[03:28:13.813 --> 03:28:16.155]  Ron Farrell wanted to break this story on NBC.
[03:28:16.355 --> 03:28:18.256]  Probably the biggest story of 2017.
[03:28:18.997 --> 03:28:20.458]  One of the biggest stories of the decade.
[03:28:21.278 --> 03:28:22.938]  NBC goes, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:28:22.998 --> 03:28:23.759]  You can't do this.
[03:28:24.219 --> 03:28:25.139]  You can't film this.
[03:28:25.179 --> 03:28:26.319]  You can't, you can't do this.
[03:28:26.959 --> 03:28:27.879]  We're not going to break it.
[03:28:28.740 --> 03:28:29.440]  Because why?
[03:28:29.460 --> 03:28:30.120]  Well, it's not ready.
[03:28:30.140 --> 03:28:31.600]  Then he said, stop reporting on it.
[03:28:32.160 --> 03:28:32.380]  Right?
[03:28:33.000 --> 03:28:34.181]  So that's what we're dealing with.
[03:28:35.021 --> 03:28:36.021]  We're not speculating.
[03:28:36.341 --> 03:28:37.941]  It isn't a conspiracy theory.
[03:28:38.301 --> 03:28:48.684]  The entire media establishment for decades has covered up for the pedophiles, for the rapists, for the druggies, for the people who want to abuse you and destroy your families.
[03:28:49.944 --> 03:28:50.644]  It's getting over.
[03:28:51.286 --> 03:28:52.788]  Thank you for watching The Info Wars.
[03:28:52.828 --> 03:29:02.562]  We'll be back after the next segment.
[03:29:05.342 --> 03:29:10.667]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[03:29:10.927 --> 03:29:12.068]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[03:29:12.308 --> 03:29:14.610]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[03:29:15.290 --> 03:29:21.796]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[03:29:21.996 --> 03:29:25.339]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[03:29:25.659 --> 03:29:27.461]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[03:29:28.101 --> 03:29:36.531]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[03:29:36.551 --> 03:29:37.512]  They know how great it is.

[03:31:39.023 --> 03:31:40.465]  Next level compared to whey.
[03:31:40.705 --> 03:31:42.306]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[03:31:42.727 --> 03:31:43.588]  It's incredible.
[03:31:44.068 --> 03:31:45.990]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[03:31:46.171 --> 03:31:47.312]  It's bigger than I am already.
[03:31:47.772 --> 03:31:48.673]  At 15, incredible.
[03:31:48.994 --> 03:31:49.895]  It is amazing.

[03:31:56.201 --> 03:31:58.542]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[03:31:58.982 --> 03:32:04.145]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[03:32:04.565 --> 03:32:05.966]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[03:32:06.206 --> 03:32:07.366]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[03:32:07.767 --> 03:32:08.567]  I want to thank you.
[03:32:08.907 --> 03:32:09.948]  We're all in this together.

[03:32:27.096 --> 03:32:36.500]  I mean, it may just be four or five days left that I'm able to offer Brain Force at this price because it's selling out so incredibly quickly at 50% off.

[03:33:05.250 --> 03:33:07.891]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:43.948 --> 03:33:45.049]  Intensity's heightened.
[03:33:45.990 --> 03:33:46.730]  He's a punk.
[03:33:47.191 --> 03:33:48.111]  He's a dog.
[03:33:48.312 --> 03:33:49.713]  I'd like to punch him in the face.
[03:33:50.640 --> 03:33:51.661]  Tensions are rising.
[03:33:53.082 --> 03:34:00.968]  I don't even care if you die.
[03:34:01.028 --> 03:34:03.850]  Come into your house and spread lies.
[03:34:04.170 --> 03:34:06.812]  Really ain't no need to ask why.
[03:34:07.052 --> 03:34:09.474]  Just sit back relax and watch them die.
[03:34:10.355 --> 03:34:11.396]  Push them off the edge.
[03:34:19.617 --> 03:34:26.543]  Donald Trump, just last week, he confirmed to the National Review that he is again considering a run in 2016.
[03:34:26.743 --> 03:34:27.503]  Do it.
[03:34:27.884 --> 03:34:28.364]  Do it.
[03:34:29.925 --> 03:34:31.366]  Look at me.
[03:34:32.347 --> 03:34:32.728]  Do it.
[03:34:33.408 --> 03:34:43.176]  I will personally write you a campaign check now on behalf of this country, which does not want you to be president, but which badly wants you to run.
[03:34:47.023 --> 03:34:54.131]  Donald J. Trump will become the 45th president of the United States, defeating Hillary Clinton in a campaign.
[03:34:54.611 --> 03:34:57.694]  In the back, Mike Cernovich.
[03:34:57.935 --> 03:34:58.856]  Cernovich.com.
[03:34:58.916 --> 03:35:01.518]  C-E-R-N-O-V-I-C-H.com.
[03:35:01.939 --> 03:35:05.803]  You can also find me at Twitter.com forward slash Cernovich.
[03:35:05.843 --> 03:35:08.506]  We got some cool stuff to talk about, some flashbacks.
[03:35:08.986 --> 03:35:17.356]  But before we do, I do want to talk about something that I personally use, because I will only talk about things that I personally use.
[03:35:17.396 --> 03:35:23.082]  So, you know, there's always great specials at InfoWars going on, and then they go, well, what do you want to plug?
[03:35:23.103 --> 03:35:24.484]  And I go, well, I'll plug what I use.
[03:35:25.565 --> 03:35:26.847]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:35:42.803 --> 03:35:56.712]  It is also like a lot of people notice that I've been going clean shaven because that also helps collagen regenerate too and that's what the collagen does is it helps your skin regenerate and become more tactile and firm and taut.
[03:35:57.332 --> 03:36:03.096]  So I truly believe in this product is fantastic actually to ask them to to send me a bunch more.
[03:36:03.116 --> 03:36:06.398]  I usually use the chocolate and I mix it with a
[03:36:07.276 --> 03:36:10.119]  Banana and almond milk is the way I do it.
[03:36:10.519 --> 03:36:19.207]  The first time I ever tried it, I used just water and although taste is subjective, I said, okay, let's make a shake out of it.
[03:36:20.028 --> 03:36:27.134]  So what I'll do is you can take the strawberry flavor, blend that up with 12 to 16 ounces of ice cold almond milk.
[03:36:27.634 --> 03:36:30.177]  Throw in some frozen blueberries too.
[03:36:30.597 --> 03:36:33.540]  Or another thing that you can do with the Caveman True Paleo formula,
[03:36:34.292 --> 03:36:40.573]  Take a banana and slice it up into small pieces and then put it in a baggie overnight.
[03:36:40.773 --> 03:36:42.694]  And when you wake up, you have frozen banana.
[03:36:43.094 --> 03:36:50.836]  So then you throw in one or two frozen bananas, one or two scoops of the Caveman True Paleo Formula, strawberry or chocolate is great for both.
[03:36:51.416 --> 03:36:52.816]  Then you blend that up with almond milk.
[03:36:53.316 --> 03:36:54.336]  That's fantastic.
[03:36:55.156 --> 03:36:56.337]  The same is true blueberries.
[03:36:57.097 --> 03:37:02.158]  So I also I'll go to Costco and buy a bunch of frozen blueberries in bulk because blueberries are very, very good for your brain.
[03:37:03.075 --> 03:37:04.736]  They improve cognitive function.
[03:37:04.776 --> 03:37:05.876]  They help your eyesight.
[03:37:06.356 --> 03:37:09.298]  So I'll also blend up blueberries with this stuff too.
[03:37:09.338 --> 03:37:12.079]  So Caveman True Paleo Formula 50% off.
[03:37:12.619 --> 03:37:14.140]  You can get it on auto shipping.
[03:37:15.420 --> 03:37:21.223]  Definitely highly encourage you to take care of your health because here's what I tell people.
[03:37:21.523 --> 03:37:22.924]  The globalists, they want us dead.
[03:37:23.324 --> 03:37:25.084]  Okay, so I'm not going to do them any favor.
[03:37:25.104 --> 03:37:26.165]  So today, for example,
[03:37:26.992 --> 03:37:31.697]  I got up and I took my daughter who by now by the time I have her strapped in it's about 25 pounds.
[03:37:32.177 --> 03:37:44.990]  I wear one of those kind of harnesses and I take her and my dog for a very brisk walk through a trail a bunch of hikes up and down the hills and then I go get a 20 francs green juice with limited apple.
[03:37:45.350 --> 03:37:48.373]  You don't want when you make a green juice people go juices too much sugar.
[03:37:49.054 --> 03:37:50.676]  Well that's only if you put in a bunch of apple.
[03:37:51.458 --> 03:38:03.703]  But if you make a green juice with kale, celery, cucumber, ginger, a little bit of lemon zest, half a lemon, and then maybe half to three quarters of an apple, there's very little sugar in that.
[03:38:03.743 --> 03:38:06.284]  So that's one of the big myths people go, green juice is just bad.
[03:38:06.885 --> 03:38:08.385]  I said, well, I drink it all the time.
[03:38:08.505 --> 03:38:09.266]  It's incredible.
[03:38:09.846 --> 03:38:12.207]  It makes your body more alkaline.
[03:38:12.847 --> 03:38:14.608]  And then, of course, I buy alkaline water.
[03:38:14.628 --> 03:38:15.808]  I should get one of the water filters.
[03:38:16.068 --> 03:38:19.570]  But the point is, I was doing all this stuff before I heard InfoWars.
[03:38:20.715 --> 03:38:25.397]  That's why whenever they go after Alex for this stuff, and I go, why don't they go after Joe Rogan for On It?
[03:38:25.977 --> 03:38:26.197]  Right?
[03:38:26.217 --> 03:38:37.682]  The Joe Rogan podcast is supported by, and I think On It's a great company too, so I'm not, I'm not, I'm complimenting them, but why do they always go after Alex for selling people clean water, selling people supplements?
[03:38:37.762 --> 03:38:48.287]  I was doing all this stuff for decades before I'd ever heard of him, and then of course Joe Rogan owns On It, and they sell a lot of the same products too, but the media doesn't go after Joe Rogan for it.
[03:38:48.931 --> 03:38:55.936]  So fundamentally, they're not attacking the products that Alex sells, because you can't attack them.
[03:38:56.156 --> 03:38:57.678]  They all meet laboratory testing.
[03:38:58.458 --> 03:38:59.639]  They're attacking you.
[03:39:00.320 --> 03:39:04.082]  They're attacking him, because they don't want people to get the truth out.
[03:39:04.122 --> 03:39:06.244]  That's why they say, oh, these products or whatever.
[03:39:06.604 --> 03:39:15.471]  But then, of course, you look at most people in media, and it's actually been proven scientifically, they're more likely to be sociopaths and they're more likely to be alcoholics.
[03:39:16.562 --> 03:39:19.607]  I don't know if they have that article saved in the Infowars.
[03:39:21.130 --> 03:39:31.006]  I should have a button where I could just push up and have that article pop up where, you know, study shows journalists are far more likely to be sociopaths than alcoholics, right?
[03:39:31.736 --> 03:39:40.180]  So you look at the average journalist going after people who are trying to not drink toxic water, not drink poisonous water, to drink alkaline water.
[03:39:40.660 --> 03:39:42.661]  I buy alkaline water, big five-gallon jugs.
[03:39:42.681 --> 03:39:47.443]  I don't know if Alex sells alkaline water, but that's a big believer.
[03:39:47.463 --> 03:39:51.385]  So the attack is never about the products.
[03:39:51.565 --> 03:39:55.787]  The attack's about Alex and the attack's about you listening in.
[03:39:55.927 --> 03:39:56.807]  They don't want you awake.
[03:39:57.047 --> 03:39:58.208]  They don't want you to feel good.
[03:39:58.488 --> 03:39:59.188]  That's the biggest thing.
[03:39:59.228 --> 03:40:00.409]  Politico had this article.
[03:40:01.480 --> 03:40:05.521]  On Trump's positive thinking and they're like, they're trying to make fun of him.
[03:40:05.861 --> 03:40:10.422]  So Politico goes, Oh, well, Trump, he's really in a rut and a failure.
[03:40:10.562 --> 03:40:11.803]  Like, why is he so happy?
[03:40:12.183 --> 03:40:13.323]  It's a fantastic article.
[03:40:13.363 --> 03:40:25.966]  I don't know if the, um, if the crew had pulled it up, but, um, yeah, I sent the article to Nico a little, little bit ago and Politico had it and they go, Trump's triumphant thinking or Trump's positive thinking.
[03:40:26.766 --> 03:40:29.027]  And why are they mad that Trump's happy?
[03:40:29.815 --> 03:40:31.796]  When you read the article, they're just seething.
[03:40:32.136 --> 03:40:33.897]  They're like, Trump should be miserable.
[03:40:34.217 --> 03:40:35.037]  He should be upset.
[03:40:35.057 --> 03:40:40.999]  Then they go, well, Trump lies to himself six times every morning, tells themselves that things are going great.
[03:40:42.360 --> 03:40:43.500]  Think about that, right?
[03:40:43.700 --> 03:40:45.581]  Yeah, the power of Trump's positive thinking.
[03:40:46.241 --> 03:40:50.303]  They're saying it has crossed the line between optimism and delusion.
[03:40:50.763 --> 03:40:51.943]  What is wrong with these people?
[03:40:52.283 --> 03:40:53.944]  They don't want you to believe in yourself.
[03:40:54.790 --> 03:40:57.651]  They don't want you taking Caveman True Formula, right?
[03:40:57.891 --> 03:41:02.692]  They don't want you to have collagen and to regrow collagen and to feel healthy.
[03:41:03.073 --> 03:41:04.713]  They don't want you to drink green juice.
[03:41:04.853 --> 03:41:06.454]  They don't want you to drink filtered water.
[03:41:06.834 --> 03:41:12.996]  They want you to drink, what they want you to drink is poison water from the tap, which they don't drink by the way.
[03:41:13.956 --> 03:41:16.037]  Do you think the New York Times is drinking tap water?
[03:41:16.057 --> 03:41:19.598]  Do you think the New York Times is filtering their water?
[03:41:20.378 --> 03:41:23.879]  Let's go to the BuzzFeed because BuzzFeed likes to write about the products a lot.
[03:41:24.617 --> 03:41:27.900]  Are they drinking tap water at BuzzFeed?
[03:41:28.220 --> 03:41:28.561]  Scoop!
[03:41:29.041 --> 03:41:29.361]  Scoop!
[03:41:29.702 --> 03:41:31.443]  BuzzFeed uses filtered water.
[03:41:31.804 --> 03:41:33.085]  Breaking news on InfoWars.
[03:41:34.266 --> 03:41:35.647]  They all drink filtered water, right?
[03:41:36.348 --> 03:41:38.450]  So it isn't about what's good or bad.
[03:41:39.290 --> 03:41:41.052]  It's about what they want you to feel bad.
[03:41:41.630 --> 03:41:42.990]  They want Trump to feel bad.
[03:41:43.311 --> 03:41:45.771]  They're saying, how dare Trump feel good about himself?
[03:41:46.111 --> 03:41:48.452]  Trump has to lie to himself to tell himself he feels great.
[03:41:49.272 --> 03:41:52.173]  But our experience of reality is primarily subjective.
[03:41:52.493 --> 03:41:56.795]  It is primarily based on the conversations we have ourselves and the things we tell ourselves.
[03:41:57.415 --> 03:42:00.996]  And yeah, you don't want to lie to yourself in a way that is harmful.
[03:42:01.436 --> 03:42:08.779]  But if you're like Trump and you're going through a big struggle, you can say, Oh God, today's going to be another rough day.
[03:42:08.799 --> 03:42:09.859]  And that's true.
[03:42:10.985 --> 03:42:19.210]  Or you could say, today is amazing because I get to face challenges that would break other people and I'm going to make it through this day.
[03:42:19.610 --> 03:42:21.011]  Both of those statements are true.
[03:42:21.491 --> 03:42:28.776]  You're not lying to yourself because, you know, I wake up sometimes and my daughter's a little grouchy and I could just say, oh, she's going to be in a bad mood today.
[03:42:28.896 --> 03:42:29.296]  Oh, God.
[03:42:29.576 --> 03:42:30.377]  Well, maybe she is.
[03:42:30.417 --> 03:42:33.058]  But then it comes on to me as a parent and say, well, good.
[03:42:33.098 --> 03:42:36.861]  This is a good opportunity for me to hang out with her, to cheer her up, to have fun.
[03:42:38.001 --> 03:42:39.382]  Both statements are true.
[03:42:39.402 --> 03:42:47.568]  So Trump is both in peril and he's living the most exciting timeline of his life, as are all of us.
[03:42:47.948 --> 03:42:51.491]  It's not delusion, but the media doesn't want you to feel good about yourselves.
[03:42:51.731 --> 03:42:55.114]  They want you to feel bad, but we want you to feel good.
[03:42:55.234 --> 03:42:57.576]  So come back into the final segment.
[03:42:57.776 --> 03:42:58.736]  We have much more.
[03:43:00.178 --> 03:43:04.441]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we're running
[03:43:05.703 --> 03:43:11.026]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[03:43:11.286 --> 03:43:12.407]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[03:43:12.667 --> 03:43:14.968]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[03:43:15.629 --> 03:43:22.132]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[03:43:22.353 --> 03:43:25.694]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[03:43:25.995 --> 03:43:27.796]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[03:43:28.456 --> 03:43:36.860]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[03:43:36.900 --> 03:43:37.861]  They know how great it is.
[03:43:38.761 --> 03:43:42.583]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[03:43:43.384 --> 03:43:44.885]  Nootropic means for the brain.
[03:43:45.665 --> 03:43:53.529]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.

[03:44:02.993 --> 03:44:05.414]  That comes to $50.03.
[03:44:05.654 --> 03:44:09.595]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
[03:44:10.015 --> 03:44:12.916]  Similar nootropics that aren't even as pure or strong cost $50 to $70.
[03:44:15.317 --> 03:44:16.198]  It's a good deal at $39.

[03:45:35.709 --> 03:45:36.169]  And more.
[03:45:36.670 --> 03:45:37.310]  Concentrate.
[03:45:37.330 --> 03:45:39.111]  You talk about next level meal replacement.
[03:45:39.372 --> 03:45:40.813]  Next level compared to whey.
[03:45:41.033 --> 03:45:42.654]  And it's great to mix with whey and then make shakes.
[03:45:43.074 --> 03:45:43.935]  It's incredible.
[03:45:44.415 --> 03:45:46.316]  My son is growing like a weed using it.
[03:45:46.336 --> 03:45:47.657]  He's bigger than I am already.
[03:45:48.117 --> 03:45:49.018]  At 15, incredible.
[03:45:49.338 --> 03:45:50.219]  It is amazing.
[03:45:50.579 --> 03:45:51.860]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:45:52.300 --> 03:45:53.421]  50% off Caveman.
[03:45:53.641 --> 03:45:54.962]  But only a few days left.
[03:45:55.222 --> 03:45:55.983]  It's about to end.
[03:45:56.543 --> 03:45:58.864]  And folks, the globalists hate it when you do this.
[03:45:59.325 --> 03:46:04.508]  We're the tip of the spear because we're fearless, we're bold, because we understand the stakes are too high.
[03:46:04.928 --> 03:46:06.309]  The globalists win, we're all slaves.
[03:46:06.549 --> 03:46:07.729]  So don't thank me for what I'm doing.
[03:46:08.110 --> 03:46:08.910]  I want to thank you.
[03:46:09.250 --> 03:46:10.311]  We're all in this together.
[03:46:10.811 --> 03:46:20.737]  And when you get the great Molon Labe t-shirts, and you get the great books and videos, and when you get the great water filtration, you help yourself, you help your family, when you get the great air filtration systems, all of them,

[03:47:05.697 --> 03:47:08.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:21.929 --> 03:47:38.624]  And back again, Mike Cernovich, Cernovich.com, C-E-R-N-O-V-I-C-H dot com, twitter.com forward slash C-E-R-N-O-V-I-C-H.
[03:47:39.025 --> 03:47:40.186]  We want to have a little bit of fun.
[03:47:40.746 --> 03:47:47.132]  Well, a little bit of fun while learning a lesson because I haven't taken this quiz yet.
[03:47:47.904 --> 03:47:54.028]  The New York Times has a quiz about Facebook's, um, what is hate speech kind of standards.
[03:47:54.308 --> 03:47:57.730]  And I know that a lot of YouTubers do that kind of fun thing.
[03:47:57.750 --> 03:48:01.393]  We're like, well, let's take a quiz together and sort of look at it.
[03:48:01.493 --> 03:48:04.495]  So if we're able to, I don't know if we are, I really should ask people.
[03:48:04.515 --> 03:48:08.817]  I really should ask the production staff before I'm like, Hey, can we do this quiz together?
[03:48:08.837 --> 03:48:11.299]  You know, to make sure they can, we all have.
[03:48:12.111 --> 03:48:14.152]  As human beings, we all have our shortcomings.
[03:48:14.732 --> 03:48:20.794]  And my shortcoming is that I don't always talk to people to prepare in advance.
[03:48:21.414 --> 03:48:26.475]  So any fault that ever happens during the show is definitely not production's fault.
[03:48:26.495 --> 03:48:27.256]  It's definitely my fault.
[03:48:27.936 --> 03:48:29.276]  So let's go ahead and take the quiz.
[03:48:29.396 --> 03:48:31.737]  There are six questions, and I haven't taken it.
[03:48:32.877 --> 03:48:34.598]  And I'm curious what they are.
[03:48:34.678 --> 03:48:37.099]  So I don't know if they can pull it up on the screen.
[03:48:37.119 --> 03:48:40.700]  I'm going to kind of read it from my computer screen.
[03:48:40.720 --> 03:48:41.060]  But they go,
[03:48:42.568 --> 03:48:43.548]  Is this hate speech?
[03:48:44.049 --> 03:48:47.049]  Why do, the question is, I'm not saying this.
[03:48:47.069 --> 03:48:48.110]  They're saying this is hate speech.
[03:48:48.790 --> 03:48:50.891]  They go, why do Indians smell like curry?
[03:48:51.171 --> 03:48:51.731]  They stink.
[03:48:52.091 --> 03:48:54.732]  Would this statement meet Facebook's criteria for hate speech?
[03:48:55.312 --> 03:48:56.192]  I would say no.
[03:48:56.212 --> 03:48:57.613]  That's like rude.
[03:48:57.853 --> 03:48:58.773]  You shouldn't say that.
[03:49:00.193 --> 03:49:00.833]  That not cool.
[03:49:00.853 --> 03:49:03.154]  But I would say that it wouldn't violate hate speech.
[03:49:03.674 --> 03:49:06.155]  So if we click on it, does it give us an answer?
[03:49:06.195 --> 03:49:08.636]  It's like a real time sort of interactive thing.
[03:49:08.656 --> 03:49:09.396]  I don't know.
[03:49:10.117 --> 03:49:11.978]  But yeah, I would say no.
[03:49:12.138 --> 03:49:23.924]  Okay, so actually yes, according to Facebook's training document claiming that specific group's stink is a degrading generalization and it would be flagged as hate speech.
[03:49:24.324 --> 03:49:34.809]  Okay, so then I guess my question, I guess my question would be if they say all white people are evil, would that be hate speech?
[03:49:35.389 --> 03:49:35.549]  Right?
[03:49:35.569 --> 03:49:38.591]  Because that's why I want to kind of take the quizzes so we can
[03:49:39.324 --> 03:49:43.108]  Think of other examples and see if that would be hate speech.
[03:49:43.148 --> 03:49:45.650]  Because first of all, if you're saying, why do Indians think?
[03:49:45.710 --> 03:49:47.512]  I think that's just a nasty thing.
[03:49:47.932 --> 03:49:49.634]  You're kind of like a nasty person.
[03:49:49.654 --> 03:49:52.276]  If you go around saying those types of things, you shouldn't say it.
[03:49:52.937 --> 03:49:54.878]  That said, you should have a right to say it.
[03:49:55.639 --> 03:49:58.922]  And then people should have a right to say, well, that's kind of a jerky thing to say.
[03:49:58.962 --> 03:50:01.985]  And then hopefully people would say, well, you're being kind of a jerk.
[03:50:02.888 --> 03:50:06.211]  Maybe you shouldn't be so much of a jerk in the future.
[03:50:06.251 --> 03:50:06.932]  That's the idea.
[03:50:07.272 --> 03:50:12.877]  People say things that aren't nice, and then we tell them they're not nice, and then hopefully we live in a nicer world.
[03:50:13.418 --> 03:50:17.261]  Next question is, hold on, let me see if I can load it.
[03:50:18.002 --> 03:50:20.564]  Poor black people should still sit at the back of the bus.
[03:50:20.624 --> 03:50:23.267]  Would this statement meet Facebook's criteria for hate speech?
[03:50:24.099 --> 03:50:33.023]  I would say yes, it definitely would meet their criteria, especially because if you're Facebook, you consider blacks to be an oppressed minority.
[03:50:33.423 --> 03:50:34.203]  So anything?
[03:50:35.484 --> 03:50:35.724]  No.
[03:50:36.444 --> 03:50:36.865]  Okay.
[03:50:38.545 --> 03:50:39.366]  That's really weird.
[03:50:39.786 --> 03:50:47.449]  So while Facebook's training document calls for any segregation as unacceptable attack, subsets of protected groups do not receive the same protection.
[03:50:48.490 --> 03:50:52.111]  So while race is a protected category, social class is not.
[03:50:52.131 --> 03:50:53.192]  This is really weird then.
[03:50:54.404 --> 03:50:57.846]  If you say, I hate black people, that's hate speech.
[03:50:58.446 --> 03:51:03.789]  But if you say, I hate poor black people, that is, this is, this is really dumb.
[03:51:04.589 --> 03:51:05.550]  And I live on the internet.
[03:51:06.030 --> 03:51:16.916]  So for those of you, by the way, who are listening in, and you can't see what's going on, what we're doing is we're taking a quiz from the New York Times, where they go through Facebook's guidelines on what is hate speech.
[03:51:17.859 --> 03:51:18.960]  And what isn't hate speech?
[03:51:19.621 --> 03:51:22.124]  And so far, I got both questions wrong.
[03:51:22.445 --> 03:51:24.607]  So I am now 0 for 2.
[03:51:25.168 --> 03:51:29.172]  The first question said, would it be hate speech to say, why do Indians stink?
[03:51:29.633 --> 03:51:32.737]  And I said, that's a mean thing to say, but I don't think it would be actually prohibited.
[03:51:33.077 --> 03:51:33.618]  I was wrong.
[03:51:34.158 --> 03:51:37.903]  And then they said, if you say poor black people should be put at the back of the bus,
[03:51:38.863 --> 03:51:43.147]  That would not be hate speech because it's okay to hate poor people.
[03:51:43.187 --> 03:51:47.710]  This really shows the problem with all these tech companies.
[03:51:48.131 --> 03:51:49.131]  I live on the internet.
[03:51:49.572 --> 03:51:50.953]  I make my living on the internet.
[03:51:51.413 --> 03:51:59.620]  Everything that I do online, every day I'm plugged into the internet matrix, practically to a point where it's virtual reality for me.
[03:52:00.416 --> 03:52:01.397]  And I'm 0 for 2 now.
[03:52:01.517 --> 03:52:03.438]  So how are some people supposed to know?
[03:52:03.458 --> 03:52:06.000]  And moreover, how do they come up with this nonsense?
[03:52:06.520 --> 03:52:08.741]  All right, so we got six questions, four more.
[03:52:08.821 --> 03:52:10.382]  Let's check out what question number three is.
[03:52:10.623 --> 03:52:12.244]  And by the way, I haven't read the quiz.
[03:52:12.264 --> 03:52:12.724]  That's the fun.
[03:52:13.545 --> 03:52:14.665]  White men are a-holes.
[03:52:14.725 --> 03:52:16.907]  Would this statement meet Facebook's criteria for hate speech?
[03:52:17.027 --> 03:52:22.130]  I would say no, because I see it every day, and nobody gets ever banned at all.
[03:52:22.190 --> 03:52:23.671]  So I'm really curious what this is.
[03:52:24.191 --> 03:52:25.052]  And they go, yes.
[03:52:26.193 --> 03:52:29.575]  According to Facebook, saying white men are a-holes
[03:52:30.350 --> 03:52:41.045]  Would be hate speech because it targets a subset of two protected categories because white men encompass race and sex with an attack of the form of cursing.
[03:52:41.305 --> 03:52:42.467]  So I actually don't believe this.
[03:52:42.868 --> 03:52:44.450]  I think this is a complete and total lie.
[03:52:45.385 --> 03:52:48.446]  Because I see kill all white men, right?
[03:52:48.526 --> 03:52:49.507]  I see murder threats.
[03:52:49.987 --> 03:52:54.189]  I see people call for white genocide and the murder of white people.
[03:52:54.229 --> 03:52:57.490]  So I'm at the point now where I don't believe any of this.
[03:52:57.530 --> 03:52:59.211]  I think it's all a lie.
[03:52:59.711 --> 03:53:04.073]  And Facebook just released this to New York Times as some kind of like public relation thing.
[03:53:04.373 --> 03:53:04.713]  All right.
[03:53:05.374 --> 03:53:06.374]  Question number four.
[03:53:07.475 --> 03:53:08.355]  For those of you at home,
[03:53:10.146 --> 03:53:11.647]  I'm reading questions out loud.
[03:53:12.187 --> 03:53:12.867]  Four of six.
[03:53:13.247 --> 03:53:16.528]  Keep trans men out of girls' bathrooms.
[03:53:16.668 --> 03:53:20.710]  The question is, would this statement meet Facebook's criteria for hate speech?
[03:53:21.550 --> 03:53:29.613]  Yes, would be my answer, because that would be transphobia, and it would be... Okay, so I finally got one right.
[03:53:29.913 --> 03:53:31.894]  Okay, one out of four.
[03:53:32.054 --> 03:53:32.914]  I finally got one right.
[03:53:34.498 --> 03:53:35.899]  Although they say it depends.
[03:53:36.539 --> 03:53:42.201]  The statement targets two protected categories, gender identity and sex, and calls for an exclusion of this group.
[03:53:43.101 --> 03:53:48.684]  But it would most likely be permitted because of continuing debates around transgender issues.
[03:53:49.404 --> 03:53:56.026]  Republican lawmakers in Texas have used similar language to rally support for legislation banning transgender bathroom access.
[03:53:56.426 --> 03:53:57.607]  Okay, this is like legalism.
[03:53:59.334 --> 03:54:02.757]  I'm a lawyer, social media maven, media commentator.
[03:54:03.357 --> 03:54:05.659]  Been before 16 million people in 60 minutes.
[03:54:05.679 --> 03:54:07.040]  I've kind of done it all.
[03:54:07.721 --> 03:54:14.606]  And I've actually, I know people at Facebook who are, I'm not going to go into all that, but let's just say I know a lot of people.
[03:54:15.267 --> 03:54:16.568]  I don't even know what the heck they're talking.
[03:54:16.588 --> 03:54:17.929]  This is all like legalism.
[03:54:18.489 --> 03:54:19.630]  This is a complete mess.
[03:54:20.651 --> 03:54:21.772]  I disavow this quiz.
[03:54:22.132 --> 03:54:23.853]  All right, question number five.
[03:54:25.054 --> 03:54:28.077]  Let's see if this would be hate speech under Facebook's group.
[03:54:29.185 --> 03:54:31.847]  Female sports supporters need to be head-to-head with hockey pups.
[03:54:32.707 --> 03:54:36.250]  Would this statement meet criteria's Facebook's were here for hate speech?
[03:54:37.510 --> 03:54:44.715]  Yes, because you're discriminating against a gender-based category of sports supporters, namely female sports supporters.
[03:54:45.576 --> 03:54:47.997]  So they go, oh my god, this is a joke.
[03:54:48.678 --> 03:54:50.359]  So they're saying actually no.
[03:54:50.499 --> 03:54:51.719]  So I got another one wrong.
[03:54:51.760 --> 03:54:53.341]  I've only gotten one out of five right.
[03:54:53.721 --> 03:54:53.841]  No.
[03:54:55.225 --> 03:55:00.628]  While gender is a protected category, Facebook's training document states that occupation is not.
[03:55:01.529 --> 03:55:07.292]  Although this is a call to violence, it would not seem to violate the company's rules of hate speech.
[03:55:08.012 --> 03:55:15.317]  That is because including occupation and the attack negates a protected, protection granted basis.
[03:55:15.377 --> 03:55:16.097]  This is so dumb.
[03:55:16.557 --> 03:55:17.498]  All right.
[03:55:17.518 --> 03:55:18.558]  We've got last one.
[03:55:19.299 --> 03:55:19.579]  Six.
[03:55:20.039 --> 03:55:22.801]  So for those of you keeping score, I've gotten one out of five right.
[03:55:24.466 --> 03:55:26.027]  All right, question number six of six.
[03:55:26.387 --> 03:55:28.108]  I'll never trust a Muslim immigrant.
[03:55:28.329 --> 03:55:30.590]  They're all thieves and robbers.
[03:55:31.150 --> 03:55:33.772]  Would this statement meet Facebook's criteria for hate speech?
[03:55:34.553 --> 03:55:37.795]  So this is tricky now, because I'm kind of figuring out the quiz.
[03:55:38.795 --> 03:55:48.862]  If it said, I'll never trust a Muslim bus driver, then I don't think it would be hate speech under the rules, because bus driver would be an occupation.
[03:55:49.736 --> 03:55:57.699]  So for those you also for by the way, those you kind of follow along at home, we're using logical reasoning to try to figure out these rules because you know what I'm gonna do with these rules?
[03:55:58.779 --> 03:56:06.962]  I'm going to figure out how people that I don't like are violating the rules and I'm going to use legalistic attacks against people who have tried to get me censored on Facebook.
[03:56:06.982 --> 03:56:09.663]  So I'm learning right now in real time.
[03:56:10.524 --> 03:56:18.867]  I'm leveling up my own game to go after people who in fairness go after me and are trying to attack me and destroy me if so fair is fair.
[03:56:20.103 --> 03:56:25.206]  So if this said, I will never trust a Muslim bus driver, then I think you could get away with it.
[03:56:25.246 --> 03:56:30.749]  But says, I would never trust a Muslim immigrant, I'm going to say that's hate speech.
[03:56:31.530 --> 03:56:37.293]  Question number six, I will claim it's hate speech because immigrant is a protected class of people.
[03:56:37.633 --> 03:56:38.494]  So let's hit yes.
[03:56:38.614 --> 03:56:39.955]  Please tell me I got two right.
[03:56:39.975 --> 03:56:42.416]  I'm being humiliated in real time.
[03:56:42.436 --> 03:56:44.297]  So click on the yes button if you would please.
[03:56:45.158 --> 03:56:46.199]  Oh my God, are you kidding me?
[03:56:46.259 --> 03:56:48.340]  I got, okay, I got, no.
[03:56:49.907 --> 03:56:50.548]  Wrong again.
[03:56:50.948 --> 03:57:03.437]  While Facebook usually considers dismissive attacks, including those targeting groups based on religious affiliation, as unacceptable, the company's training manuals classify immigrants as a quasi-protected category.
[03:57:04.357 --> 03:57:08.881]  This means they are not protected against some types of attacks, including dismissive attacks.
[03:57:10.522 --> 03:57:13.144]  Alright, well, you just watched me fail.
[03:57:13.894 --> 03:57:14.975]  The social media test.
[03:57:15.596 --> 03:57:17.558]  So hopefully this clip will go viral.
[03:57:18.059 --> 03:57:21.142]  People who hate me can make fun of me and say Cernovich is an idiot.
[03:57:21.522 --> 03:57:23.485]  How'd this guy ever pass the California bar exam?
[03:57:24.025 --> 03:57:24.926]  How's this guy anything?
[03:57:24.946 --> 03:57:26.868]  The dummy only got one out of six.
[03:57:26.988 --> 03:57:28.090]  He tells you he knows so much.
[03:57:28.490 --> 03:57:29.691]  So I was just humiliated.
[03:57:29.711 --> 03:57:33.696]  So we'll call that segment Cernovich Fails Facebook
[03:57:34.443 --> 03:57:36.704]  Now ladies and gentlemen, we're running
[03:57:55.054 --> 03:58:00.378]  The biggest special we've ever had for our best-selling product, Brain Force.
[03:58:00.638 --> 03:58:01.759]  Now Brain Force Plus.
[03:58:02.019 --> 03:58:04.321]  There's 20% more in each bottle.
[03:58:04.981 --> 03:58:11.506]  And we're now purchasing so much of it from the major organic manufacturer here in the United States that we've been able to get it for less.
[03:58:11.707 --> 03:58:15.029]  So I'm offering for the first time ever 50% off.
[03:58:15.349 --> 03:58:17.151]  And I thought I could offer this for maybe a month.
[03:58:17.791 --> 03:58:26.221]  I'm going to have to stop this special within a week because it is blasting out of our warehouse because the fans of it already are stocking up.
[03:58:26.241 --> 03:58:27.202]  They know how great it is.
[03:58:28.123 --> 03:58:31.867]  A whole bunch of organic, natural, healthy, known nootropics.
[03:58:32.808 --> 03:58:34.229]  Tropic means for the brain.
[03:58:35.010 --> 03:58:42.877]  And if you want good, clean, focused energy, then BrainForce is for you and you're supporting the broadcast at the same time.
[03:58:43.318 --> 03:58:49.263]  So for a limited time, ladies and gentlemen, BrainForce Plus is now 50% off or $19.96.
[03:58:49.303 --> 03:58:50.084]  That comes to $50.03.
[03:58:50.164 --> 03:58:53.808]  A little bit over 50% off the regular price.
