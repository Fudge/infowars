[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.363]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.424 --> 00:00:23.189]  It's Wednesday, July 19th, 2017.
[00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:24.452]  I'm your host, Owen Schroer.
[00:00:24.672 --> 00:00:25.694]  Here's what's on the news tonight.
[00:00:29.201 --> 00:00:29.562]  Tonight...
[00:00:30.745 --> 00:00:43.292]  President Donald Trump says let Obamacare fail as the GOP hangs itself after refusing to repeal the Obama-era Affordable Care Act.
[00:00:43.753 --> 00:00:52.938]  Then, the mainstream media catches Trump red-handed as he shakes hands with Vladimir Putin at the G20 Summit.
[00:00:53.358 --> 00:00:54.359]  You know what that means.
[00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:55.680]  Collusion!
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:04.765]  Plus, a controlled opposition candidate gets busted for tweeting out a photoshopped picture with the president.
[00:01:05.225 --> 00:01:09.668]  All that plus InfoWars teaches private security a lesson.
[00:01:09.788 --> 00:01:11.569]  Ma'am, I don't want to argue with you.
[00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:15.511]  You know, you're arguing with me because, you know, what does this say here?
[00:01:15.531 --> 00:01:16.011]  Security?
[00:01:16.452 --> 00:01:17.712]  No, you don't film it anymore.
[00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:22.055]  That's coming up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.512 --> 00:01:35.355]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[00:01:36.476 --> 00:01:47.404]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite, the establishment, the science community is fully aware of the fact
[00:01:47.984 --> 00:01:53.667]  That our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[00:01:54.387 --> 00:02:02.310]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:11.815]  And that they went for the bones first, knowing that they were full of the vital essence in the marrow, but also in the bone structure itself.
[00:02:12.615 --> 00:02:18.804]  And so I set out, working with the top formulator in the country, to develop Caveman.
[00:02:19.225 --> 00:02:27.317]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients.
[00:02:27.817 --> 00:02:32.041]  known for cleansing and supercharging the body.
[00:02:32.622 --> 00:02:34.904]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:43.532]  We're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[00:02:43.932 --> 00:02:49.675]  Because of you praying for the broadcast, because of you buying the products and financially supporting the transmissions.
[00:02:49.916 --> 00:02:55.579]  So please secure your caveman today at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:03:07.225 --> 00:03:08.865]  Today was the big day!
[00:03:09.706 --> 00:03:10.386]  The big day!
[00:03:10.806 --> 00:03:11.806]  Finally upon us!
[00:03:12.286 --> 00:03:12.806]  Finally!
[00:03:12.986 --> 00:03:16.147]  The vote to repeal Obamacare!
[00:03:17.367 --> 00:03:19.368]  We've been waiting for years for this day, folks.
[00:03:19.408 --> 00:03:20.448]  We've been waiting for years.
[00:03:21.208 --> 00:03:26.209]  Our Republican leaders have been telling us, campaigning, how they're going to repeal Obamacare.
[00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:28.570]  The day is finally here.
[00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.730]  What happened?
[00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:31.790]  Did they come through?
[00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.851]  Are Republicans the real deal?
[00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:35.471]  Did they mean it?
[00:03:36.735 --> 00:03:40.256]  When they said what they said, let's roll back the clocks.
[00:03:40.456 --> 00:03:44.017]  Let's flash back and look at our Republican leaders.
[00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:50.478]  Let's start with Mitch McConnell at CPAC in 2013 telling you what he was going to do about Obamacare.
[00:03:50.498 --> 00:03:56.040]  I want you to take a look at that stack of paper behind me.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.741]  It's the most powerful argument yet against Obamacare.
[00:04:02.745 --> 00:04:04.106]  And this was after they passed it.
[00:04:04.426 --> 00:04:07.629]  You know, Nancy Pelosi said they have to pass it first just to read it.
[00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:09.390]  She still hasn't read it.
[00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.232]  20,000 pages of rules and regulations.
[00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:17.836]  20,000 pages.
[00:04:18.877 --> 00:04:23.800]  Yeah, Jonathan Gruber said it passed because of the American public's ignorance.
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.082]  And if you think that's bad, wait till they try to fix it.
[00:04:26.782 --> 00:04:27.783]  Wait till they try to fix it?
[00:04:27.823 --> 00:04:28.524]  You mean like now?
[00:04:28.544 --> 00:04:31.686]  On Wednesday we had a vote in the Senate to defund this monstrosity.
[00:04:33.348 --> 00:04:38.011]  Every single Republican voted to defund Obamacare.
[00:04:40.013 --> 00:04:41.534]  So you assume you could get him to repeal it then?
[00:04:41.554 --> 00:04:42.975]  Should be easy.
[00:04:46.317 --> 00:04:47.738]  Thank God for Mitch McConnell!
[00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:48.839]  He's gonna do it!
[00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:50.841]  Every Democrat voted the other way.
[00:04:50.861 --> 00:04:56.205]  And that's what these Democrats voted for.
[00:04:58.046 --> 00:04:59.607]  This monument to liberalism
[00:05:01.573 --> 00:05:02.754]  Monumental liberalism!
[00:05:03.054 --> 00:05:08.357]  They're going to have a lot of fun explaining that to their constituents, I can tell you that.
[00:05:10.258 --> 00:05:11.539]  This law is a disaster.
[00:05:12.859 --> 00:05:16.541]  Anybody who thinks we've moved beyond it is dead wrong.
[00:05:17.982 --> 00:05:22.625]  Obamacare should be repealed root and branch.
[00:05:26.305 --> 00:05:26.925]  There it is.
[00:05:27.746 --> 00:05:28.826]  There's Mitch McConnell.
[00:05:28.846 --> 00:05:32.068]  He told us in 2013, we're going to repeal.
[00:05:32.368 --> 00:05:33.228]  We got the votes.
[00:05:33.788 --> 00:05:37.630]  These Democrats over here, this is a monument to liberalism for them.
[00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.731]  This document that I'm going to take down.
[00:05:39.751 --> 00:05:41.392]  We're going to repeal this whole thing.
[00:05:41.432 --> 00:05:41.932]  Look at this thing.
[00:05:41.972 --> 00:05:42.532]  It's brutal.
[00:05:42.873 --> 00:05:44.653]  There's Mitch McConnell taking it to them.
[00:05:45.814 --> 00:05:49.536]  But they didn't have everything they needed quite yet.
[00:05:50.359 --> 00:05:58.006]  They couldn't get that repeal vote through, but then Paul Ryan came to the rescue and said, don't worry, we're still going to get that repeal.
[00:06:00.929 --> 00:06:04.072]  Someone named Obama vetoed a bill repealing Obamacare.
[00:06:05.333 --> 00:06:12.640]  And we will hold a vote to override this veto, taking this process all the way to the end under the Constitution.
[00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:14.885]  But here's the thing.
[00:06:16.006 --> 00:06:20.391]  The idea that Obamacare is the law of the land for good is a myth.
[00:06:21.632 --> 00:06:26.037]  This law will collapse under its own weight or it will be repealed.
[00:06:26.937 --> 00:06:31.301]  Because all those rules and procedures Senate Democrats have used to block us from doing this?
[00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:32.282]  Democrats' fault.
[00:06:32.342 --> 00:06:33.303]  That's all history!
[00:06:33.383 --> 00:06:33.883]  It's history!
[00:06:33.903 --> 00:06:40.009]  We have shown now that there is a clear path to repealing Obamacare without 60 votes in the Senate.
[00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:41.611]  You don't even need the votes!
[00:06:42.131 --> 00:06:42.371]  Thank God.
[00:06:42.411 --> 00:06:46.815]  If we're sending this bill to a Republican president, it will get signed into law.
[00:06:47.176 --> 00:06:47.836]  Just need the president.
[00:06:47.856 --> 00:06:48.937]  Obamacare will be gone.
[00:06:49.138 --> 00:06:49.758]  Just need the president.
[00:06:49.778 --> 00:06:50.018]  And then...
[00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:53.480]  For all the people who have seen their premiums go up.
[00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.101]  For people who have lost their plan or their doctor.
[00:06:58.061 --> 00:07:01.822]  For people who have to deal with all the mandates, the restrictions, and the red tape.
[00:07:02.822 --> 00:07:06.223]  We can replace this law with a truly patient-centered healthcare system.
[00:07:07.603 --> 00:07:08.843]  It's just a matter of time.
[00:07:10.364 --> 00:07:10.864]  There it is!
[00:07:11.404 --> 00:07:12.104]  Paul Ryan!
[00:07:12.264 --> 00:07:12.724]  All right!
[00:07:13.404 --> 00:07:15.045]  Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan.
[00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:16.829]  What are they telling us?
[00:07:17.249 --> 00:07:19.230]  We want to get this repealed!
[00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.011]  This bill is nasty!
[00:07:22.311 --> 00:07:23.511]  It's killing America!
[00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:24.732]  It's failing!
[00:07:25.212 --> 00:07:26.412]  We just need the House.
[00:07:26.732 --> 00:07:27.913]  We just need the Senate.
[00:07:28.253 --> 00:07:29.713]  We just need the Presidency.
[00:07:30.154 --> 00:07:34.235]  We'll get the votes and we don't even need the votes and we're still gonna do it, baby!
[00:07:34.255 --> 00:07:36.196]  Come on, we're the Republicans!
[00:07:36.756 --> 00:07:37.916]  We got your back!
[00:07:38.676 --> 00:07:40.317]  We're gonna repeal this bad boy!
[00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:42.851]  And today was the day to do it.
[00:07:43.311 --> 00:07:47.434]  But let's just understand what they're talking about here.
[00:07:48.194 --> 00:07:53.438]  Let's try to get a grasp on what it is that's been holding the Republicans back from this repeal.
[00:07:53.818 --> 00:07:59.942]  Let's go back to the 111th United States Congress, where Democrats were in the majority.
[00:08:00.842 --> 00:08:03.984]  You had 57 Democrats and 41 Republicans.
[00:08:05.065 --> 00:08:07.667]  And that was in the Senate, and then in the House,
[00:08:08.564 --> 00:08:12.726]  You had 255 Democrats and 179 Republicans.
[00:08:12.806 --> 00:08:17.409]  So, they didn't have the votes, they didn't have the mandate, they didn't have the majority.
[00:08:17.549 --> 00:08:18.710]  There's nothing they could do.
[00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:22.012]  That was Obama's first Congress and, you know, Democrats were in control.
[00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:26.272]  Okay, so he feels he can pass Obamacare.
[00:08:26.312 --> 00:08:31.817]  Let's fast forward to the 112th Congress, the second Congress under Barack Obama.
[00:08:31.837 --> 00:08:33.978]  Let's take a look at the Senate.
[00:08:33.998 --> 00:08:36.120]  51 Democrats, 47 Republicans.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.683]  Okay, so Republicans are gaining momentum there, slowly.
[00:08:40.143 --> 00:08:41.244]  But then you look at the House.
[00:08:41.644 --> 00:08:42.825]  Big change!
[00:08:43.666 --> 00:08:45.027]  242 Republicans, 193 Democrats.
[00:08:45.047 --> 00:08:46.588]  But they didn't have the Senate.
[00:08:46.628 --> 00:08:48.070]  They didn't have the Senate.
[00:08:51.499 --> 00:08:52.600]  So let's fast forward.
[00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.562]  113th United States Congress.
[00:08:55.782 --> 00:08:56.863]  Let's look at the Senate.
[00:08:57.803 --> 00:08:59.685]  Unfortunately, still don't have the Senate.
[00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:00.505]  They got the House.
[00:09:00.545 --> 00:09:02.627]  They still, Republicans had the House, 234 to 201.
[00:09:03.267 --> 00:09:04.248]  But Democrats, 53.
[00:09:05.309 --> 00:09:06.950]  Senators to Republicans, 45.
[00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:08.611]  Just didn't have that Senate.
[00:09:09.312 --> 00:09:11.233]  So the Republicans said, just give us that Senate.
[00:09:12.033 --> 00:09:12.874]  We've got the House.
[00:09:12.914 --> 00:09:13.935]  Just give us that Senate.
[00:09:14.055 --> 00:09:15.116]  Just give us that Senate.
[00:09:15.136 --> 00:09:15.776]  We'll get it done.
[00:09:16.397 --> 00:09:17.117]  Give us a Senate.
[00:09:19.599 --> 00:09:21.040]  And so here we are now.
[00:09:23.124 --> 00:09:27.247]  And you fast forward to the 114th United States Congress.
[00:09:27.647 --> 00:09:28.308]  And look at that!
[00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:30.309]  Republicans have the House!
[00:09:31.089 --> 00:09:32.330]  Republicans have the Senate!
[00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:32.911]  We did it!
[00:09:33.551 --> 00:09:34.592]  We gave you the Senate!
[00:09:34.652 --> 00:09:35.692]  We gave you the House!
[00:09:35.772 --> 00:09:37.073]  You can finally repeal!
[00:09:38.594 --> 00:09:40.215]  We did what you asked, Mitch McConnell.
[00:09:40.235 --> 00:09:42.557]  We did what you asked, Republicans.
[00:09:42.597 --> 00:09:43.477]  We gave you the Senate.
[00:09:43.498 --> 00:09:44.258]  We gave you the House.
[00:09:44.278 --> 00:09:45.439]  You can finally repeal!
[00:09:46.872 --> 00:09:47.532]  And then they did it.
[00:09:47.773 --> 00:09:49.274]  And they put the repeal bill out there.
[00:09:49.534 --> 00:09:50.134]  And what happened?
[00:09:50.815 --> 00:09:52.055]  Obama vetoed it.
[00:09:52.135 --> 00:09:55.638]  So then Paul Ryan comes out and says, we just need the presidency.
[00:09:56.719 --> 00:09:58.059]  So let's fast forward again.
[00:09:58.159 --> 00:10:00.621]  This is now the 115th Congress.
[00:10:01.041 --> 00:10:02.142]  It is in session now.
[00:10:02.582 --> 00:10:04.083]  Republicans have the Senate, 52 to 46.
[00:10:04.123 --> 00:10:05.044]  Republicans have the House, 240 to 194.
[00:10:05.104 --> 00:10:07.306]  And Republicans have the presidency.
[00:10:07.346 --> 00:10:07.586]  We did it!
[00:10:15.006 --> 00:10:16.027]  We did it.
[00:10:16.427 --> 00:10:18.888]  We, the people, came through.
[00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:23.271]  You told us what it took to repeal Obamacare, so we did it.
[00:10:24.191 --> 00:10:26.612]  And today was finally our day.
[00:10:26.973 --> 00:10:34.457]  And that's why yesterday Mitch McConnell came out when it was obvious that the Republican health care bill was going to fail.
[00:10:35.497 --> 00:10:38.019]  Mitch McConnell said this yesterday.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.704]  We will now try a different way to bring the American people relief from Obamacare.
[00:10:44.204 --> 00:10:46.526]  I think we owe them at least that much.
[00:10:46.586 --> 00:10:46.927]  That's right.
[00:10:46.967 --> 00:10:47.267]  You do.
[00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:59.377]  In the coming days, the Senate will take up and vote on a repeal of Obamacare combined with a stable two-year transition period as we work toward patient-centered health care.
[00:11:00.358 --> 00:11:03.601]  A majority of the Senate voted to pass the same repeal legislation back in 2015.
[00:11:05.831 --> 00:11:07.232]  President Obama vetoed it then.
[00:11:07.252 --> 00:11:09.473]  It's Obama's fault.
[00:11:10.473 --> 00:11:11.774]  President Trump will sign it now.
[00:11:12.134 --> 00:11:13.034]  We gave you the president!
[00:11:13.094 --> 00:11:15.736]  I imagine many Democrats were celebrating last night.
[00:11:16.956 --> 00:11:19.517]  I hope they consider what they are celebrating.
[00:11:20.518 --> 00:11:21.618]  The American people are hurting.
[00:11:22.459 --> 00:11:23.219]  They need relief.
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:32.904]  And it's regretful that our Democratic colleagues decided early on that they did not want to engage with us seriously in the process to deliver that relief.
[00:11:34.039 --> 00:11:35.780]  But this doesn't have to be the end of the story.
[00:11:36.981 --> 00:11:42.424]  Passing the repeal legislation will allow us to accomplish what we need to do on behalf of our people.
[00:11:42.984 --> 00:11:43.865]  There it is, folks!
[00:11:43.925 --> 00:11:44.645]  There it is!
[00:11:45.085 --> 00:11:48.307]  Yesterday, Mitch McConnell saying again, we've got it.
[00:11:48.347 --> 00:11:49.108]  We've got the House.
[00:11:49.328 --> 00:11:50.108]  We've got the Senate.
[00:11:50.128 --> 00:11:50.989]  We've got the President.
[00:11:51.049 --> 00:11:52.230]  He's not going to veto this.
[00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:53.570]  We can repeal.
[00:11:54.671 --> 00:11:55.471]  We can repeal.
[00:11:55.511 --> 00:11:59.334]  We can finally stop this bill that is so unconstitutional.
[00:11:59.714 --> 00:12:01.455]  It has all these Americans ailing.
[00:12:02.705 --> 00:12:04.499]  We can finally do something about it.
[00:12:06.118 --> 00:12:07.299]  I mean, look at the numbers, folks.
[00:12:07.319 --> 00:12:07.999]  I mean, look at this.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.321]  This is even the Washington Post.
[00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:13.823]  How badly has the Obama era damaged the Democrat Party?
[00:12:14.443 --> 00:12:20.347]  Under President Obama, Democrats have lost over 900 state legislature seats, 12 governors, 69.
[00:12:20.527 --> 00:12:22.189]  It's actually more than 69.
[00:12:22.309 --> 00:12:22.989]  I think it's over 70.
[00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:25.671]  House seats and 13 Senate seats.
[00:12:25.711 --> 00:12:26.892]  So there's Obama's legacy.
[00:12:26.912 --> 00:12:29.694]  We gave you everything you wanted, Mitch McConnell.
[00:12:29.934 --> 00:12:32.115]  We gave you everything you wanted, Paul Ryan.
[00:12:32.575 --> 00:12:34.176]  All you had to do was repeal.
[00:12:35.177 --> 00:12:48.304]  All you had to do was sign your name on a piece of paper to repeal Obamacare, which you all admit is failing, which you all admit is collapsing, which you all admit is what the American people want, which you all admit once we have the House, the Senate, and the Presidency, we can do.
[00:12:48.644 --> 00:12:49.744]  And then what did you do?
[00:12:50.105 --> 00:12:51.365]  You failed.
[00:12:53.126 --> 00:12:53.646]  You failed.
[00:12:53.906 --> 00:12:55.447]  You are a loser, Mitch McConnell.
[00:12:55.467 --> 00:12:56.848]  You are a loser, Paul Ryan.
[00:12:57.068 --> 00:13:00.470]  And I mean that by you're going to lose the next time you're on the ballot.
[00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:07.282]  Because by your own admission, Americans wanted Obamacare repealed and you didn't do it.
[00:13:10.103 --> 00:13:12.504]  For seven years, you told us that you were going to do this.
[00:13:12.564 --> 00:13:15.004]  You were going to stop the Democrat health care bill.
[00:13:16.145 --> 00:13:17.525]  You told us we just need the Senate.
[00:13:17.725 --> 00:13:18.445]  We gave you the Senate.
[00:13:18.485 --> 00:13:19.686]  We told you we just need the House.
[00:13:19.706 --> 00:13:20.406]  We gave you the House.
[00:13:20.426 --> 00:13:21.846]  We said, well, we just need the presidency.
[00:13:21.886 --> 00:13:22.847]  We gave you the presidency.
[00:13:23.147 --> 00:13:25.308]  And then you didn't deliver.
[00:13:29.049 --> 00:13:29.289]  And then
[00:13:30.444 --> 00:13:37.189]  McConnell and Ryan and these neocons have the nerve to blame the Democrats.
[00:13:37.869 --> 00:13:38.970]  Hey, that worked!
[00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:41.292]  That did work until today.
[00:13:42.973 --> 00:13:58.644]  So now folks, in fact, how about now folks, if Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan are looking at who to blame for the Obamacare not being repealed today, they just need to look in a mirror and they'll know.
[00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:00.810]  It was all your fault.
[00:14:01.811 --> 00:14:03.031]  And so what does this really mean?
[00:14:04.251 --> 00:14:07.492]  Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan are total fakes.
[00:14:08.332 --> 00:14:09.873]  Total frauds.
[00:14:11.213 --> 00:14:20.655]  Now, what's going to happen here is they're going to try to pass the buck on this and scapegoat the people who didn't vote to repeal.
[00:14:22.476 --> 00:14:23.736]  And those people are
[00:14:25.097 --> 00:14:32.499]  Shelly Capito, Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins, a famous never-Trumper.
[00:14:33.219 --> 00:14:37.380]  Susan Collins looks like she may be, well, I'm not even going to go there, folks.
[00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:46.582]  But Ben Garrison tweets this image out, and this is important because this is what stopped Obamacare from being repealed.
[00:14:46.922 --> 00:14:48.562]  You can call these representatives.
[00:14:49.853 --> 00:15:01.817]  Shelly Capito, Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins, all fake Republicans, all fake conservatives, these are the three people that stopped Obamacare from being repealed.
[00:15:02.217 --> 00:15:06.579]  And while they will own this, and their names will be on this as the voters that stopped it,
[00:15:07.642 --> 00:15:14.324]  Do not think for one second that Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan did not have this math already decided.
[00:15:14.684 --> 00:15:19.126]  Do not think for one second this wasn't a strategic move to have these three women doing it.
[00:15:19.446 --> 00:15:25.008]  Do not think for one second that the Republicans were shocked when Obamacare was not repealed today.
[00:15:25.848 --> 00:15:26.008]  No.
[00:15:27.268 --> 00:15:27.408]  No.
[00:15:28.149 --> 00:15:29.069]  They knew all along.
[00:15:29.909 --> 00:15:32.310]  They've been lying to you all along.
[00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:35.391]  Now let's look at some stats on Obamacare.
[00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:37.662]  Let's start off in Indiana.
[00:15:38.263 --> 00:15:48.534]  Over 76,000 people in Indiana may lose their health insurance next year after more insurers are abandoning Obamacare.
[00:15:49.314 --> 00:15:49.895]  Yes, that's right.
[00:15:49.955 --> 00:15:58.044]  These Obamacare providers are leaving left and right because nobody's signing up for Obamacare because they can't afford it.
[00:15:59.053 --> 00:16:00.274]  How about Arizona?
[00:16:00.894 --> 00:16:09.078]  In Arizona, average premiums are up $4,800 since Obamacare was implemented.
[00:16:09.478 --> 00:16:09.998]  Wait a second.
[00:16:10.259 --> 00:16:11.959]  It's called the Affordable Care Act.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.601]  We're passing it because nobody can afford health care.
[00:16:15.061 --> 00:16:18.323]  And then they're going to raise the premiums in Arizona up over $4,500.
[00:16:18.363 --> 00:16:20.944]  And then guess what?
[00:16:20.984 --> 00:16:21.644]  You can't afford it.
[00:16:22.785 --> 00:16:24.746]  The Unaffordable Affordable Care Act.
[00:16:25.967 --> 00:16:33.259]  How about in Ohio, 22 counties are currently projected to have no coverage options next year.
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:34.441]  None!
[00:16:35.482 --> 00:16:35.943]  Zero!
[00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:39.551]  And another 28 counties may have no choices.
[00:16:39.591 --> 00:16:43.534]  So they already know there's 22 counties in Ohio don't have any options for Obamacare.
[00:16:43.955 --> 00:16:48.238]  And there's 28 countries that, well, they might not have any options for Obamacare.
[00:16:48.658 --> 00:16:52.761]  And then, of course, there's all these counties around the nation with just one option.
[00:16:53.262 --> 00:16:55.564]  And, of course, that would be monopoly care.
[00:16:55.584 --> 00:16:57.025]  And then there's that 38 percent decline.
[00:17:00.555 --> 00:17:09.739]  38% decline from last year alone in the number of health insurance insurers that initially filed to sell Obamacare plans in 2018.
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.981]  Again folks, this is a bill that was meant to fail.
[00:17:14.521 --> 00:17:18.983]  This is a bill that they wanted to pass without you knowing the truth, without you even reading it.
[00:17:19.183 --> 00:17:20.284]  They admit it themselves.
[00:17:20.484 --> 00:17:21.704]  Just look at Jonathan Gruber.
[00:17:21.904 --> 00:17:23.085]  Just look at Nancy Pelosi.
[00:17:23.638 --> 00:17:32.042]  And now, look at Mitch McConnell, look at Paul Ryan, and look at the three fake Republicans led by Susan Collins that didn't want to repeal Obamacare today.
[00:17:32.422 --> 00:17:33.622]  Got bad news for y'all.
[00:17:34.143 --> 00:17:35.143]  Y'all about to get fired.
[00:17:36.184 --> 00:17:38.024]  The American people know who you are now.
[00:17:38.485 --> 00:17:41.506]  So you've outed yourselves as anti-Americans and total fraud conservatives.
[00:17:41.926 --> 00:17:43.487]  Good luck in the next round of elections.
[00:17:44.167 --> 00:17:45.948]  Now, let's move forward to
[00:17:47.321 --> 00:17:52.384]  What broke today, an absolute bombshell news story, folks.
[00:17:52.464 --> 00:17:55.146]  This is so big on so many different levels.
[00:17:56.446 --> 00:18:01.569]  President Trump ends CIA program arming anti-Assad rebels.
[00:18:01.589 --> 00:18:04.751]  That's Mikel Thelen from InfoWars.com.
[00:18:04.851 --> 00:18:09.194]  Obama-backed fighters repeatedly found supporting terrorists in Syria.
[00:18:10.196 --> 00:18:13.179]  But folks, even the Washington Post.
[00:18:13.899 --> 00:18:15.361]  Of course, InfoWars is on that.
[00:18:15.401 --> 00:18:17.122]  We've been telling you this has been going on for years.
[00:18:17.603 --> 00:18:18.964]  But the Washington Post?
[00:18:19.485 --> 00:18:25.610]  Trump ends covert CIA program to arm anti-Assad rebels in Syria, aka ISIS terrorists.
[00:18:26.031 --> 00:18:27.112]  A move sought by Moscow.
[00:18:27.432 --> 00:18:29.234]  Look at all of the propaganda in this.
[00:18:30.632 --> 00:18:36.114]  First of all, they say anti-Assad rebels in Syria, that's ISIS, radical Islamic terrorists.
[00:18:36.635 --> 00:18:38.836]  Yes, proxy wars started with the CIA.
[00:18:39.136 --> 00:18:41.837]  But then I love how they say, a move sought by Moscow.
[00:18:42.677 --> 00:18:51.501]  So Trump stops the United States from arming terrorists in Syria, what Obama was doing, arming terrorists, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, arming terrorists.
[00:18:51.942 --> 00:18:55.743]  And then they say, Trump did it, he stopped that because of Russia!
[00:18:56.023 --> 00:18:56.844]  Oh my gosh!
[00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:05.840]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years.
[00:19:06.465 --> 00:19:13.029]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:19:13.589 --> 00:19:15.670]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.672]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:19:19.132 --> 00:19:20.433]  It's made in the USA.
[00:19:21.073 --> 00:19:29.438]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:19:29.798 --> 00:19:31.038]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:19:32.239 --> 00:19:36.083]  Our formula at Infowarslife.com is quite frankly simple.
[00:19:36.724 --> 00:19:45.152]  We go out and look at the recognized research and we take it to the next level of quality, of purity, and of strength.
[00:19:46.138 --> 00:19:49.523]  Because this is what I personally use for myself and my family.
[00:19:49.943 --> 00:19:57.534]  We've gone through five or six different permutations in the last four years, since we launched InfoWars Live, to actually come up with this.
[00:19:58.315 --> 00:20:02.101]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:09.543]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:20:09.783 --> 00:20:24.226]  If you're not mitigating the pesticides, the heavy metals, the chemicals, if you're not trying to purify your water, if you're not trying to take products like Z-Shield that are full of known concentrated compounds that'll purify our cells and our bodies, you're crazy!
[00:20:24.706 --> 00:20:30.267]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.045]  That Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:36.105 --> 00:20:44.373]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:44.573 --> 00:20:51.300]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the New World Order.
[00:20:52.312 --> 00:20:56.098]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:20:56.559 --> 00:21:00.306]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:21:01.482 --> 00:21:05.325]  I want to tell you about some of the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:21:05.365 --> 00:21:07.226]  We are under constant attack.
[00:21:07.707 --> 00:21:09.908]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[00:21:10.108 --> 00:21:14.231]  They're trying to attack us on every level now with the YouTube scandal.
[00:21:14.251 --> 00:21:27.381]  They're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:29.683]  They can't get to us that way.
[00:21:30.063 --> 00:21:32.885]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[00:21:32.905 --> 00:21:33.886]  They don't have that power.
[00:21:34.367 --> 00:21:36.889]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[00:21:37.249 --> 00:21:39.651]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:21:40.092 --> 00:21:42.934]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:42.954 --> 00:21:44.595]  This is by listener request.
[00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:50.080]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue Toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.681]  Again,
[00:21:51.411 --> 00:21:57.156]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, then you're absolutely insane.
[00:21:57.576 --> 00:22:01.879]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.323]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[00:22:08.346 --> 00:22:11.068]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from us?
[00:22:11.088 --> 00:22:29.484]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com with the new Bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[00:22:29.824 --> 00:22:32.645]  We don't get put on extremist list even though they want us to.
[00:22:32.685 --> 00:22:34.706]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[00:22:35.066 --> 00:22:37.067]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[00:22:37.527 --> 00:22:49.112]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[00:22:49.172 --> 00:22:53.014]  So support us by getting the products at infowarsstore.com
[00:23:04.013 --> 00:23:13.302]  Linda Sarsour is becoming a prominent figure of liberals, specifically for women's rights, when you consider her leadership role with the Women's March.
[00:23:13.762 --> 00:23:15.063]  But this is a little confusing.
[00:23:15.504 --> 00:23:20.429]  This is a woman who talks about Sharia law and women's rights in the same sentence.
[00:23:20.949 --> 00:23:23.591]  Something there doesn't add up.
[00:23:24.012 --> 00:23:25.834]  I'm now joined by Leanne McAdoo.
[00:23:26.314 --> 00:23:33.278]  Who, I'll be a little sexist here, she's a woman, so we're going to listen to her opinion on these matters.
[00:23:33.698 --> 00:23:43.904]  Leanne, when you see the rhetoric that Linda Sarsour is putting out there, and that young women are absorbing and young women are taking to heart, what thoughts come to your head?
[00:23:45.606 --> 00:23:46.667]  Absolute madness.
[00:23:47.428 --> 00:23:48.349]  Liberal lunacy.
[00:23:48.369 --> 00:24:04.285]  I mean, how can you have a women's march with a woman who's advocating for Sharia law, she's praising Saudi Arabia, when we just had a most recent story of a girl who was arrested for daring to wear a skirt and go out without her head covering.
[00:24:04.625 --> 00:24:09.410]  She was arrested, of course, and I think they let her go because she got so much international outcry.
[00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:11.972]  But none from the Women's March, surprisingly.
[00:24:12.032 --> 00:24:15.676]  None from any of our leftist feminists here in the United States.
[00:24:16.496 --> 00:24:30.885]  Yeah, and you know, she tweeted at Jake Tapper, I found this really strange, she tweets at Jake Tapper, Jake Tapper joins the ranks of the alt-right trying to target me online, welcome to the party.
[00:24:31.786 --> 00:24:41.152]  Okay, Linda, trust me, Jake Tapper is not part of the alt-right, but Linda Sarsour already came out and made a tweet saying how people are on a list
[00:24:41.832 --> 00:24:45.815]  She said that she has people on a list, people who have attacked her.
[00:24:45.895 --> 00:24:49.398]  I guess she's saying that Jake Tapper is now on that list.
[00:24:50.139 --> 00:24:51.040]  Uh, wow.
[00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:54.583]  How about Linda Sarsour making a list and then adding Jake Tapper to it?
[00:24:55.891 --> 00:24:56.111]  Right.
[00:24:56.192 --> 00:25:04.664]  Jake Tapper is now a white nationalist because he is one of the very few people who is saying, when are we going to address this, okay?
[00:25:04.884 --> 00:25:06.907]  We've got the Women's March over the weekend.
[00:25:06.947 --> 00:25:12.054]  They tweeted out a picture of Assata Shakur and said she is a symbol of the women's resistance.
[00:25:12.635 --> 00:25:17.762]  Of course, she was one of the first people, maybe one of the only women that's on the FBI's most wanted list.
[00:25:18.123 --> 00:25:20.446]  She's a domestic terrorist, convicted cop killer.
[00:25:20.927 --> 00:25:23.611]  And they're out here praising her.
[00:25:24.272 --> 00:25:25.774]  She's a symbol of resistance.
[00:25:26.094 --> 00:25:28.838]  So Jake Tapper responds to this and says, come on.
[00:25:29.899 --> 00:25:32.760]  Is anyone going to address this elephant in the room?
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:38.462]  Now they're praising a domestic terrorist and all of the outrageous comments made by Linda Sarsour.
[00:25:39.202 --> 00:25:46.505]  Because, surprisingly, Jake Tapper is actually condemning what Linda Sarsour is saying.
[00:25:46.525 --> 00:25:50.026]  Yeah, Jake Tapper from CNN is condemning Linda Sarsour.
[00:25:51.058 --> 00:26:02.761]  We have no Democratic senators or any of these people like Dianne Feinstein, Kamala Harris, and Kirsten Gillibrand, all these women who really got behind the Women's March and said everyone needs to follow these women.
[00:26:03.001 --> 00:26:08.483]  I think Gillibrand actually interviewed Sarsour and the other Women's March leaders for Time magazine.
[00:26:09.123 --> 00:26:33.639]  None of them have condemned the comments made by Linda Sarsour or the fact that the Women's March is out there promoting happy birthday to this domestic terrorist convicted cop killer and actually Mark Lamont Hill stands by his praise for Assata Shakur because he's one of the conspiracy theorists that doesn't that believes she was framed and set up by COINTELPRO that she didn't actually commit this but
[00:26:34.099 --> 00:26:38.662]  That's the problem when you're the leader of a gang that's calling for the killing of cops.
[00:26:39.162 --> 00:26:43.865]  You can't really convince people that you were framed when cops start ending up dead.
[00:26:43.945 --> 00:26:47.287]  So there's just, that's a whole side argument there.
[00:26:47.967 --> 00:26:54.331]  You know, even though you bring up very important points that need to be addressed, I'll just go ahead and say, alright, fine, let's ignore all of that.
[00:26:54.511 --> 00:27:02.576]  Let's ignore everything that you just said that should be relevant when discussing Linda Sarsour, and let's just talk about the point that she literally said
[00:27:03.436 --> 00:27:06.960]  She wants to launch jihad against our president.
[00:27:07.341 --> 00:27:13.668]  I mean, that right there should be enough for the Jake Tappers of the world to say, okay, this woman needs to be stopped.
[00:27:13.688 --> 00:27:14.990]  Her rhetoric is way too extreme.
[00:27:15.819 --> 00:27:34.602]  Right, and then of course she's trying to immediately come out and police people's languages by saying that everyone's taking her words out of context, that, you know, we don't understand the true meaning of jihad, it just means struggle, and that she's calling for people to do a more peaceful form of jihad, just, you know, political activism, let that, which, you know,
[00:27:35.785 --> 00:27:36.245]  Bless her.
[00:27:36.825 --> 00:27:37.306]  Thank you.
[00:27:37.346 --> 00:27:37.926]  Yes, please.
[00:27:37.986 --> 00:27:41.968]  Let's let jihad just be, you know, non-violent from here on out.
[00:27:42.328 --> 00:27:47.770]  But she leaves this speech off by paying tribute to Siraj Wajah.
[00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:50.312]  She says that that person is her favorite person in the room.
[00:27:50.672 --> 00:27:55.974]  This was an unindicted co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.
[00:27:56.254 --> 00:28:01.557]  Of course, she also gives the big hug to Razmia Odeh, who was also on that list.
[00:28:01.597 --> 00:28:04.358]  This was the woman who actually has now been deported.
[00:28:05.679 --> 00:28:11.303]  She was convicted for killing back in, I think, 1969.
[00:28:11.603 --> 00:28:18.628]  So again, another Palestinian terrorist here who this is one of Linda Sarsour's favorite people in the room.
[00:28:19.789 --> 00:28:27.695]  So, you know, again and again she's kind of had these family ties to terrorism, has these strange connections, yet
[00:28:28.375 --> 00:28:33.201]  Still being propped up by the left and no one is taking a stand.
[00:28:33.241 --> 00:28:39.589]  Surprisingly, it's Jake Tapper who comes out and says, come on, when are we going to talk about this?
[00:28:41.016 --> 00:28:42.477]  No, actually, I'm glad that you went there.
[00:28:42.537 --> 00:28:43.757]  I wasn't actually aware of that.
[00:28:44.217 --> 00:28:54.181]  You know, Linda Sarsour, I actually, I didn't even know about this, but years ago, Linda Sarsour tweeted out how the Underwear Bomber was actually a CIA operative.
[00:28:54.602 --> 00:28:59.684]  Again, this was years ago, I think maybe 2014, when she originally tweeted that.
[00:28:59.724 --> 00:29:03.145]  Guys, if you'll pull up the original tweet, so I can check the date on that.
[00:29:03.845 --> 00:29:08.347]  2012, Linda Sarsour tweets out, Underwear Bomber was CIA all along.
[00:29:08.627 --> 00:29:09.668]  Why did I already know that?
[00:29:10.528 --> 00:29:12.649]  Shame on us scaring the American people.
[00:29:12.669 --> 00:29:15.571]  So, yeah, the underwear bomber's been exposed by InfoWars.
[00:29:15.951 --> 00:29:17.812]  Why she knows that, I don't know.
[00:29:17.872 --> 00:29:19.793]  That's a question for you to answer, not us.
[00:29:20.093 --> 00:29:23.875]  And then she's intenuating you're trying to scare people by inciting Islamophobia.
[00:29:24.615 --> 00:29:26.877]  It's a real weird angle that she's taking here.
[00:29:27.237 --> 00:29:29.478]  I didn't even know what to make of that, and then you brought that up.
[00:29:31.041 --> 00:29:42.425]  Right, and then this is also a woman who is attacking Ayaan, and this is something that Jake Tapper brought up because immediately Linda Sarsour says, oh, well, you're now a member of the alt-right, Jake Tapper, get in line.
[00:29:42.925 --> 00:29:45.746]  Tell me what are some of the outrageous things I've said and done.
[00:29:45.906 --> 00:29:49.647]  And then, so he takes the bait, like, okay, I'll let you know.
[00:29:50.027 --> 00:29:52.628]  First of all, one of the things that you did was talk about
[00:29:53.648 --> 00:30:08.442]  One of these anti-radical Islamic activists, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, she was a victim of Islamic female genital mutilation, and Linda Sarsour said she wanted to just remove her entire vagina because she's not allowed to be a woman.
[00:30:08.682 --> 00:30:13.126]  This is someone who says that you can't be a feminist and also pro-Israel.
[00:30:13.466 --> 00:30:17.330]  This is why we're seeing the Women's March and a lot of these other groups kicking out
[00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:18.391]  I think so.
[00:30:33.773 --> 00:30:38.634]  Well yeah, and it's ridiculous too, because she walks around wearing this hijab every time she gives a speech.
[00:30:39.175 --> 00:30:45.336]  Women in the Middle East, Afghanistan, Iran, they've been protesting the hijab since the 70s!
[00:30:45.716 --> 00:30:59.160]  They've been protesting this women's oppression since the 70s, and here's Linda Sarsour, literally like a dinosaur for women's rights, coming out here wearing the hijab, a symbol of women's oppression.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.121]  The whole thing is just strange to me.
[00:31:02.501 --> 00:31:09.847]  That's why I went on and I responded to Linda Sarsour and I said, hey Linda, why don't you take the Women's March to Iran?
[00:31:10.188 --> 00:31:12.289]  Why don't you take the Women's March to Iraq?
[00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:16.713]  Take the Women's March to Afghanistan, Somalia, Yemen, Saudi Arabia.
[00:31:17.013 --> 00:31:21.958]  Why don't you take the Women's March to those countries where women are actually being systematically oppressed?
[00:31:22.557 --> 00:31:23.517]  I don't think that's going to happen.
[00:31:23.537 --> 00:31:25.638]  Because she wants to bring that here to the West.
[00:31:25.918 --> 00:31:47.444]  She wants that systematic oppression to be here in the West and it's just so strange because there's so many young women are being led behind her like she's the Pied Piper leading them to their demise and it's just it's interesting we can kind of look at that joking video that the Daily Show did the other day with Alex Jones comparing her to Gwyneth Paltrow
[00:31:48.144 --> 00:31:48.785]  We're good to go.
[00:32:03.915 --> 00:32:19.966]  Get away from the far right left extremes and then find where we have a common ground and interestingly It's happened now with Jake Tapper joining the rest of us Conservatives who are saying who the hell is Linda Sarsour and why is she being propped up?
[00:32:20.166 --> 00:32:25.570]  When are we going to fight back against people promoting this progressive agenda?
[00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:30.253]  Which I also think is so hilarious because Islam is so not progressive.
[00:32:30.333 --> 00:32:33.575]  It's actually majorly archaically conservative
[00:32:34.516 --> 00:32:39.719]  Yeah, imagine if the same laws in Saudi Arabia applied here.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.801]  There wouldn't be a woman walking around!
[00:32:41.841 --> 00:32:42.922]  You'd all be in jail!
[00:32:43.162 --> 00:32:46.064]  You wouldn't be allowed to wear that top you're wearing there, Leigh-Anne.
[00:32:46.104 --> 00:32:47.445]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:32:47.825 --> 00:32:48.426]  Thank you, Owen.
[00:32:49.126 --> 00:32:53.790]  That's Leigh-Anne McAdoo, a true champion for women's rights, unlike Linda Sarsour.

[00:34:02.091 --> 00:34:03.531]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[00:34:06.292 --> 00:34:13.575]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[00:34:13.775 --> 00:34:24.098]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[00:34:24.418 --> 00:34:31.963]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.

[00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:44.391]  And this part is most important.
[00:34:44.511 --> 00:34:50.995]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.

[00:34:53.896 --> 00:34:56.718]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[00:34:56.798 --> 00:34:59.539]  That's InfoWarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:34:59.579 --> 00:35:01.260]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:06.543]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:35:06.623 --> 00:35:17.548]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:35:17.708 --> 00:35:22.632]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:35:22.752 --> 00:35:25.274]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:35:25.334 --> 00:35:26.835]  It helps detoxify.
[00:35:27.035 --> 00:35:29.877]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:35:29.937 --> 00:35:34.681]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:35:34.701 --> 00:35:38.844]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly
[00:35:39.244 --> 00:35:46.269]  Dependent upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:35:46.369 --> 00:35:47.810]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:48.731]  This is so key.
[00:35:48.991 --> 00:35:53.294]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:35:53.314 --> 00:35:55.415]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:35:55.536 --> 00:35:58.998]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:36:02.369 --> 00:36:08.552]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:36:08.912 --> 00:36:11.794]  Dr. Grip, it took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:36:12.134 --> 00:36:17.317]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:36:17.757 --> 00:36:23.720]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.002]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:36:27.142 --> 00:36:28.603]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[00:36:28.803 --> 00:36:32.927]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:36:33.127 --> 00:36:36.010]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:37.652]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:36:37.752 --> 00:36:40.935]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:36:41.215 --> 00:36:43.558]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:36:43.818 --> 00:36:44.779]  It's in powder form.
[00:36:44.879 --> 00:36:47.582]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:36:47.762 --> 00:36:48.363]  I take this.
[00:36:48.463 --> 00:36:50.164]  This is the product that I take.
[00:36:50.284 --> 00:36:52.246]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:36:53.068 --> 00:36:53.829]  We fight the Globals.
[00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:54.712]  We fight the New World Order.
[00:36:55.032 --> 00:36:59.223]  Secure your DNA Force today at Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:08.701]  Are you a deplorable?
[00:37:08.721 --> 00:37:10.101]  I am a deplorable.
[00:37:10.922 --> 00:37:11.402]  Definitely.
[00:37:12.022 --> 00:37:12.983]  We are deplorables.
[00:37:13.343 --> 00:37:15.404]  We actually live right outside of Denton.
[00:37:15.484 --> 00:37:19.446]  I just graduated from UNT, so a lot of liberals there.
[00:37:21.708 --> 00:37:30.533]  And as you know, like, well, Denton County voted Republican, but Denton City voted Democrat.
[00:37:32.033 --> 00:37:32.954]  Is this not public?
[00:37:36.403 --> 00:37:37.943]  This guy's gonna harass us.
[00:37:38.543 --> 00:37:41.364]  Is this not the public sidewalk right here?
[00:37:48.906 --> 00:37:49.546]  What is this?
[00:37:53.487 --> 00:37:54.247]  Are you serious?
[00:37:54.287 --> 00:37:56.867]  So this guy's seriously trying to call... Yeah.
[00:37:57.948 --> 00:37:58.728]  Woo!
[00:38:02.168 --> 00:38:08.193]  This guy is seriously trying to have us leave here and we're literally standing on the sidewalk here.
[00:38:09.614 --> 00:38:10.195]  In Dallas.
[00:38:10.475 --> 00:38:14.138]  We're being harassed.
[00:38:14.799 --> 00:38:15.259]  Okay, crazy.
[00:38:15.279 --> 00:38:17.821]  Alright, so I have a question.
[00:38:17.841 --> 00:38:20.163]  Is this not public property?
[00:38:29.167 --> 00:38:29.467]  No ma'am.
[00:38:30.228 --> 00:38:31.809]  This, the sidewalk right here.
[00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:34.331]  This is a private owned park.
[00:38:36.573 --> 00:38:38.154]  No, I'm talking about the sidewalk.
[00:38:39.135 --> 00:38:40.876]  This is a private owned park ma'am.
[00:38:51.323 --> 00:38:55.184]  This sidewalk is private owned or did the city of Dallas pave this sidewalk?
[00:38:55.204 --> 00:38:57.045]  We ran out of space into the food trucks.
[00:38:57.125 --> 00:38:59.926]  We ran out of space into the food trucks.
[00:39:10.543 --> 00:39:12.184]  Because they pay for the food spaces.
[00:39:12.684 --> 00:39:16.766]  And all this sidewalk here, all the way to the very end, belongs to Clyde Warm Park.
[00:39:16.946 --> 00:39:22.969]  And all this sidewalk here, all the way to the very end, belongs to Clyde Warm Park.
[00:39:32.153 --> 00:39:37.836]  So what about this area where people stand and push the button for the crosswalk?
[00:39:37.896 --> 00:39:39.017]  Is that private or public?
[00:39:40.325 --> 00:39:51.311]  Ma'am, you can walk all you want, but you can't do any interviews or anything like that.
[00:39:54.633 --> 00:39:57.495]  Because this is a private... We're not even in your park!
[00:39:57.515 --> 00:39:58.556]  We're on the sidewalk!
[00:39:59.891 --> 00:40:00.752]  We left the park.
[00:40:00.932 --> 00:40:02.713]  Ma'am, I don't want to argue with you.
[00:40:03.133 --> 00:40:06.635]  You know, you're arguing with me because, you know, what does this say here?
[00:40:06.696 --> 00:40:07.156]  Security?
[00:40:08.056 --> 00:40:09.597]  What does this say here?
[00:40:09.737 --> 00:40:10.578]  Security?
[00:40:11.579 --> 00:40:15.141]  Do you think security would tell you anything wrong that would be wrong for this park?
[00:40:15.581 --> 00:40:18.062]  That we're not already, you know, licensed to do?
[00:40:18.402 --> 00:40:19.443]  This is what we're here for.
[00:40:19.903 --> 00:40:26.166]  Because they pay us to make sure that the rules, and this is why we have rules on our board up there, you know.
[00:40:26.707 --> 00:40:29.248]  If people don't want to abide by the rules, you know, this is why.
[00:40:29.288 --> 00:40:31.509]  There's kind of rules we all have to abide by.
[00:40:31.529 --> 00:40:32.590]  It's called the Bill of Rights.
[00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:33.650]  That's right.
[00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:36.411]  You might have the Bill of Rights rules and all that you got, sir.
[00:40:36.792 --> 00:40:38.252]  And I wish you'd quit filming.
[00:40:38.673 --> 00:40:39.953]  I wish you'd quit filming.
[00:40:39.993 --> 00:40:42.074]  No, I don't want you to film anymore.
[00:40:42.114 --> 00:40:43.335]  No, you don't film it anymore.
[00:40:54.987 --> 00:41:00.630]  Sir, it seems like you're on an authoritarian power trip right now, sir.
[00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:03.311]  Oh look, we've got another person from InfoWars.
[00:41:03.551 --> 00:41:08.713]  So apparently InfoWars can't have a meeting at a park and we can't talk to people.
[00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:11.054]  We are on the sidewalk right here.
[00:41:11.274 --> 00:41:12.774]  We are not inside the park.
[00:41:12.954 --> 00:41:14.115]  We're on the sidewalk.
[00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:20.863]  How does it feel to come up and talk to us while these guys are telling us we can't be here?
[00:41:21.223 --> 00:41:22.064]  I thought he was crazy.
[00:41:22.084 --> 00:41:23.405]  I don't know what he was tripping on.
[00:41:23.525 --> 00:41:24.605]  I don't know what was going on.
[00:41:24.625 --> 00:41:27.587]  I was looking for you, but I ran into him.
[00:41:29.128 --> 00:41:29.868]  Oh my gosh.
[00:41:30.688 --> 00:41:37.052]  Let's go over here just for the sake of conducting an interview without these guys harassing us.
[00:41:38.393 --> 00:41:39.853]  Doesn't this seem like it's public?
[00:41:40.214 --> 00:41:41.354]  This sidewalk here?
[00:41:41.374 --> 00:41:43.816]  I mean... No, there's the tracks right here.
[00:41:45.523 --> 00:41:50.986]  There's no food trucks because apparently that is owned because they lease them out to the food trucks.
[00:41:51.146 --> 00:41:53.307]  So apparently that's what's going on over there.
[00:41:53.407 --> 00:41:54.087]  That's what they said.
[00:41:54.427 --> 00:41:55.708]  And I'll bet it's a city permit.
[00:41:56.148 --> 00:41:56.928]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:57.769 --> 00:42:02.991]  So I can't imagine how this would be like private as well.
[00:42:03.111 --> 00:42:04.232]  So we'll see though.
[00:42:04.272 --> 00:42:06.933]  I'm sure they're going to come over here and oh, here they come.
[00:42:08.149 --> 00:42:11.311]  Oh my gosh, these people will literally not leave us alone.
[00:42:11.351 --> 00:42:12.872]  We're being stalked and harassed.
[00:42:13.112 --> 00:42:15.053]  We are on a public property right now.
[00:42:15.133 --> 00:42:16.494]  We are at a crosswalk.
[00:42:16.914 --> 00:42:20.936]  We have completely vacated this park.
[00:42:20.956 --> 00:42:20.996]  Hi.
[00:42:22.137 --> 00:42:23.057]  Yeah, hi.
[00:42:24.118 --> 00:42:24.858]  Nice to meet you.
[00:42:25.418 --> 00:42:26.179]  What's the problem?
[00:42:26.659 --> 00:42:30.821]  Well, it's because you have to have a permit to record or to interview people at the park.
[00:42:32.222 --> 00:42:33.142]  We're not at the park.
[00:42:33.663 --> 00:42:35.584]  We're on the sidewalk at a crosswalk right now.
[00:42:36.621 --> 00:42:37.742]  We are not at your park.
[00:42:38.062 --> 00:42:39.383]  What whole line?
[00:42:39.443 --> 00:42:39.824]  Okay, so...
[00:43:06.738 --> 00:43:08.400]  There's no food trucks right here, though.
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:11.023]  Yeah, we have a First Amendment right.
[00:43:11.043 --> 00:43:11.864]  We're with the press.
[00:43:11.904 --> 00:43:12.765]  We're not filming commercially.
[00:43:12.785 --> 00:43:13.966]  We're filming the press right now.
[00:43:28.848 --> 00:43:32.691]  Do you know about the Constitution, the First Amendment right, freedom of the press?
[00:43:32.951 --> 00:43:35.133]  We're filming with the news, with the press.
[00:43:35.433 --> 00:43:38.836]  We're not commercially, we are not commercially filming.
[00:43:38.896 --> 00:43:41.038]  And I understand what you're talking about with permits.
[00:43:41.418 --> 00:43:48.764]  Typically, those are people who are going to film for commercials, for businesses, for movies, TV shows, things like that.
[00:43:49.044 --> 00:43:51.486]  We're filming with the news right now.
[00:43:51.706 --> 00:43:53.347]  And we have press passes.
[00:43:53.427 --> 00:43:55.169]  We are news affiliates.
[00:43:59.787 --> 00:44:03.348]  Well, even our news give us a heads up that we're in the park and that we don't know.
[00:44:03.368 --> 00:44:07.948]  So all I can do is tell you my rules and regulations and what's going on with the park.
[00:44:08.309 --> 00:44:12.089]  So other news outlets are allowed to be in the park without a permit, right?
[00:44:12.109 --> 00:44:15.450]  I mean, all news outlets are, but they give us a heads up so we know.
[00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:19.911]  We didn't know anything about your being in the park, so all I can do is tell you our rules and our regulations.
[00:44:20.391 --> 00:44:22.231]  Okay, well I told these guys here.
[00:44:22.251 --> 00:44:22.311]  Woo!
[00:44:22.331 --> 00:44:22.411]  Yeah!
[00:44:29.934 --> 00:44:42.379]  I told these guys here that we're with the news and they continue to bother us.
[00:44:43.259 --> 00:44:44.200]  So what's the problem?
[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:48.541]  How is it that other news agencies can film here, but we can't?
[00:44:49.081 --> 00:44:50.862]  Why are you violating our First Amendment?
[00:44:51.582 --> 00:44:54.864]  Oh, I do apologize if you feel that, but we just have to have the documentation.
[00:44:54.924 --> 00:44:56.184]  Like, I've never heard of you.
[00:44:56.264 --> 00:44:57.985]  Okay, I'll show you my press pass right now.
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:04.265]  Okay, so now that we can...
[00:45:10.962 --> 00:45:12.083]  Now that we can actually speak.
[00:45:12.103 --> 00:45:13.544]  Because I walked up to you guys.
[00:45:13.824 --> 00:45:14.285]  Right?
[00:45:14.365 --> 00:45:15.486]  Y'all, you didn't grab me.
[00:45:15.506 --> 00:45:16.586]  I walked up to you.
[00:45:17.207 --> 00:45:28.956]  Yet they're trying to kick you out of the park and finally they get the, I guess their boss out here and you're like, well, we're not grabbing people and we have press passes and she didn't know who you guys were, which.
[00:45:29.657 --> 00:45:36.942]  But she even said herself if we were the mainstream media, then they would have just left us alone because it's because we weren't the mainstream media.
[00:45:36.962 --> 00:45:37.843]  We're InfoWars.
[00:45:37.883 --> 00:45:38.904]  That's why we're getting harassed.
[00:45:49.548 --> 00:45:51.470]  Some call it the heartland.
[00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:54.832]  Others call it America's breadbasket.
[00:45:56.293 --> 00:45:59.356]  Progressives call it flyover America.
[00:45:59.996 --> 00:46:02.839]  But those that live there call it home.
[00:46:10.797 --> 00:46:31.407]  I'm Millie Weaver and you're watching Flyover America, an InfoWars original series where we're going to be traveling around the United States talking to Flyover America, the people who feel like they have had their voices ignored by their government, by the mainstream media, and by the people on the coast.
[00:46:31.867 --> 00:46:37.149]  So we're going to be talking to the deplorables, finding out why they actually supported Trump.
[00:46:37.569 --> 00:46:44.751]  Why this movement got so big to where it actually determined the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.
[00:46:45.151 --> 00:46:50.233]  So come along with us on this journey as we discover Flyover America.
[00:46:50.553 --> 00:46:57.235]  Throughout our travels we will be making scheduled stops to talk with those who want to tell their story.
[00:46:57.955 --> 00:47:01.056]  I'm Millie Weaver and you're watching Flyover America.
[00:47:02.972 --> 00:47:07.755]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.436 --> 00:47:09.997]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.397 --> 00:47:15.401]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.761 --> 00:47:21.205]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.605 --> 00:47:28.189]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.991]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.092 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.494 --> 00:47:40.116]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.296 --> 00:47:42.857]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.897 --> 00:47:55.264]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.484 --> 00:48:00.846]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:01.026 --> 00:48:02.047]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.327 --> 00:48:03.327]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.747 --> 00:48:08.309]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.529 --> 00:48:13.411]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.816]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out The Importance of Iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.896 --> 00:48:20.037]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.217 --> 00:48:25.142]  And whatever you do, support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.322 --> 00:48:30.287]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.467 --> 00:48:30.748]  Absolutely!
[00:48:45.828 --> 00:48:48.409]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.429 --> 00:48:49.470]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:50.511]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.551 --> 00:48:51.151]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.531 --> 00:48:59.076]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield niacin iodine X2 at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.096 --> 00:48:59.956]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.976 --> 00:49:00.016]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:06.576 --> 00:49:25.128]  Clearly the deep state wants to try to remove Trump from office and declare the 2016 historic political realignment as Russian meddling and not just remove Trump from office, but say that all the Republicans that got elected in that giant landslide that took control of the House and Senate, that they all got elected by Russian meddling.
[00:49:25.408 --> 00:49:27.489]  Now all the so-called hacking's been disproven.
[00:49:28.009 --> 00:49:33.633]  But there are a few meetings, like there would be with anybody at that level in a political race, with some Russians.
[00:49:35.029 --> 00:49:39.291]  Now, of course, Hillary and Obama have thousands of times the contacts.
[00:49:39.651 --> 00:49:40.472]  But that doesn't matter.
[00:49:41.152 --> 00:49:46.855]  Because the MSM is basically the audiovisual department for the Democratic Party and for the globalists.
[00:49:47.657 --> 00:49:55.262]  But the big thing they're doing, even if they can't remove Trump, because national polls show only 6% of Americans think the Russia thing is real.
[00:49:55.743 --> 00:49:56.983]  It's totally fallen on its face.
[00:49:57.744 --> 00:50:07.090]  But the real issue is it allows the shadow government to keep its people organized as if they're the real government opposing an outside government of Russia.
[00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:09.572]  That gives them what they believe their internal cover.
[00:50:10.293 --> 00:50:11.673]  Now that's one part of it.
[00:50:11.693 --> 00:50:16.577]  The other part of the equation is even though they can't remove Trump with this fraud,
[00:50:17.799 --> 00:50:22.282]  It allows them to introduce the idea that he's still illegitimate, and then here's the big one.
[00:50:23.463 --> 00:50:25.244]  And people really need to understand this.
[00:50:26.685 --> 00:50:30.548]  They want to set it up where any contact by the executive branch with Russia.
[00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:39.107]  Any contact with the Russians, public meetings, private meetings, diplomatic meetings, is dirty, is evil, is suspect, is espionage.
[00:50:39.727 --> 00:50:53.580]  And the big example of that is, the two days of the G20 meeting, more than four meals they had, on the last night of the conference, at a public event, with all the diplomatic staff there and the leaders of 20 countries,
[00:50:55.969 --> 00:50:59.170]  The G20 set it up where Melania, the first lady, was sitting with Putin.
[00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:02.411]  And they had a Japanese translator between them, who could speak English.
[00:51:03.412 --> 00:51:05.132]  And you can see photos of the meetings.
[00:51:05.492 --> 00:51:15.636]  There'd be two world leaders sitting together, a world leader's wife or husband, sitting next to a world leader, and then one translator sitting right behind them, basically translating for the two.
[00:51:16.176 --> 00:51:19.157]  And the G20 put Melania with Putin.
[00:51:20.618 --> 00:51:23.481]  Obviously a wise choice, because it causes discussions and debates.
[00:51:23.761 --> 00:51:25.742]  The two can both communicate with each other.
[00:51:26.863 --> 00:51:30.647]  And then during the three-hour dinner, Trump comes over and talks to him for a few minutes.
[00:51:30.947 --> 00:51:32.428]  Totally, completely normal.
[00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:40.435]  But CNN turns that into something dirty, and then Trump comes out and says, there's nothing sinister about this, this is normal activity.
[00:51:40.695 --> 00:51:44.619]  And CNN goes, yeah, it would be normal activity, except you're under investigation.
[00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:52.455]  So it's the deep state, it's the loser bureaucracy throwing absolutely massive fits in everybody's face.
[00:51:53.436 --> 00:51:56.058]  And it just shows how they're going to take anything he does.
[00:51:56.098 --> 00:52:00.762]  Just like when the Russian ambassador a few months ago had the first meeting with Trump in the White House.
[00:52:01.084 --> 00:52:09.732]  And they went in a closed door meeting, which is normal, and they acted like that was somehow dirty, and then he gave them national security secrets and told them, I'm worried about laptop bombs.
[00:52:10.212 --> 00:52:10.693]  Remember that?
[00:52:11.253 --> 00:52:19.321]  Two months before it was in the news that Trump was worried about laptop bombs, because ISIS and Al Qaeda was learning how to do that, and there had been alerts on the news.
[00:52:21.414 --> 00:52:24.715]  But this is how they take everything and misrepresent it.
[00:52:24.735 --> 00:52:33.478]  It's like when a nuclear sub came calling in South Korea and Trump said publicly, we've got nukes, we've got subs, we've got aircraft carriers, North Korea better watch it, a normal show of force.
[00:52:34.379 --> 00:52:35.339]  Pentagon advised.
[00:52:36.119 --> 00:52:42.561]  They turned that into a conversation with the Philippine president that he told him we've got nuke subs and that quote, he told him where the location was.
[00:52:43.442 --> 00:52:46.663]  Our Navy showed the sub docking there as a show of force.
[00:52:47.003 --> 00:52:49.504]  But this is how they play on public ignorance.
[00:52:50.745 --> 00:53:03.193]  This is how they're creating this new political correctness, where the talking point from Howard Stern, from hosts on CNN, from MSNBC, from Congressman Quigley of Illinois, is, you don't talk to Russians.
[00:53:03.813 --> 00:53:14.480]  The new saying is, quote, you don't talk to a Russian who's in the Russian government, you don't talk to a Russian who's an American, you don't talk to a Russian on the phone, talking to Russians is espionage.
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:15.361]  That's a quote.
[00:53:16.215 --> 00:53:19.518]  That's a quote by Bayer, formerly the CIA, on CNN.
[00:53:19.718 --> 00:53:22.161]  That's a quote by Quigley on MSNBC.
[00:53:22.601 --> 00:53:24.683]  That's a quote by Nancy Pelosi.
[00:53:24.703 --> 00:53:25.964]  That's a quote by Maxine Waters.
[00:53:26.244 --> 00:53:27.866]  And I heard Howard Stern two days ago.
[00:53:27.886 --> 00:53:29.127]  I was flipping through the dial.
[00:53:29.147 --> 00:53:32.030]  He was talking about Don King and Donald Trump.
[00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:35.073]  And he said, you don't take a phone call from Russians.
[00:53:35.313 --> 00:53:36.254]  You don't talk to them.
[00:53:36.514 --> 00:53:37.995]  And Robin goes, that's right.
[00:53:38.416 --> 00:53:39.737]  You don't talk to Russians.
[00:53:41.198 --> 00:53:41.879]  They're our enemy.
[00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:50.715]  And that's the new talking point as well, is that all Russians are our enemy and we are at war with Russia.
[00:53:51.316 --> 00:53:53.917]  The Vanity Fair reporters out there saying it, they're all saying it.
[00:53:54.698 --> 00:53:59.721]  The Esquire reporter, so-called reporter, you know, the failed Keith Overman is saying, Russian scum!
[00:53:59.941 --> 00:54:01.322]  We're at war with Russian scum!
[00:54:01.603 --> 00:54:06.366]  No, we have globalists that have hijacked our country, that are allied with radical Islam, and that are bringing it in.
[00:54:06.866 --> 00:54:08.587]  You know, they put out that super deluxe video.
[00:54:08.627 --> 00:54:09.948]  It's got like 15 million views now.
[00:54:10.209 --> 00:54:12.650]  Top video online in the last four days.
[00:54:13.751 --> 00:54:20.696]  And in the super deluxe video, from excerpts from like six months ago, I say, oh, we love our Somalis.
[00:54:20.836 --> 00:54:22.077]  Oh, we love our Muslims too.
[00:54:22.497 --> 00:54:23.298]  Oh, they're so good.
[00:54:23.378 --> 00:54:24.119]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[00:54:24.739 --> 00:54:26.540]  And then the police chief says, you know, they're perfect.
[00:54:26.881 --> 00:54:31.084]  The police chief saying this guy that shot the woman, unarmed woman, who's a Somali cop,
[00:54:31.624 --> 00:54:32.984]  He's oh so good, oh so sweet.
[00:54:33.384 --> 00:54:38.786]  And the Washington Post is actually saying we're worried about Islamophobia and he's the victim, not the dead woman.
[00:54:39.066 --> 00:54:45.047]  And there's more cases of Somalis attacking folks walking their dogs, stabbing people, screaming Allah Akbar, and the media's making it up.
[00:54:45.447 --> 00:54:51.909]  So it just shows how I made a joke six months ago how they cover up for radical Islamic terror, particularly Somalis, that they're bringing in en masse.
[00:54:52.887 --> 00:55:05.058]  And then, right as the video comes out, there's a whole spat, or whole spate, a whole raft, a whole rash, a whole new group of Islamic terror, and Islamic attacks, and Islamic bizarreness from the Somalis.
[00:55:05.719 --> 00:55:07.620]  So, this is the craziness that's going on.
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:12.425]  It just shows how we're so on target, and that's why the globalists hate us, and why they're after us, and why...
[00:55:12.745 --> 00:55:21.947]  The ADL calls us extremists and racists and Nazis and all this crap because they are the people supporting real Nazis and giving awards to real Nazis like George Soros.
[00:55:22.187 --> 00:55:31.189]  But they want to hype up their crazed masses of liberal brainwashed fascists to go out and shoot people like we saw with Congressman Scalise.
[00:55:31.649 --> 00:55:41.912]  We've had the Southern Poverty Law Center, their own supporters go out and shoot people and say they go to churches and shoot people because of the stuff they read from the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:55:42.552 --> 00:55:44.654]  It's the left saying hashtag hunt Republicans.
[00:55:44.734 --> 00:55:46.136]  It's the left calling for violence.
[00:55:46.196 --> 00:55:48.939]  It's George Soros funding the groups that are out killing cops.
[00:55:49.419 --> 00:55:50.240]  This is so sick.
[00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:55.125]  We have to come together against globalism and what it's allied with, radical Islam.
[00:55:55.819 --> 00:55:59.081]  So back to the live transmission with David Knight, Owen Schroyer and more.
[00:55:59.501 --> 00:56:02.884]  I'll be back in later today, live as well, taking care of some stuff this morning for the family.
[00:56:03.304 --> 00:56:05.345]  And then I'll be back tomorrow, Lord willing, 11 a.m.
[00:56:05.405 --> 00:56:08.948]  Central with the weekday transmission this coming Thursday.
[00:56:09.388 --> 00:56:13.871]  But for this live Wednesday edition, folks, think about how crazy it's gotten, how desperate.
[00:56:14.031 --> 00:56:15.532]  They want to paralyze our president.
[00:56:15.752 --> 00:56:19.455]  They admit they're doing this by saying any contact with Russians is treason.
[00:56:19.695 --> 00:56:25.299]  When the president is the president, a separate branch of government, he could go meet for five days and close doors.
[00:56:25.879 --> 00:56:28.742]  Like Reagan and people did with Gorbachev, if he wanted to.
[00:56:28.803 --> 00:56:29.924]  He could do whatever he wanted.
[00:56:30.565 --> 00:56:40.997]  But the idea that he can't, at a state dinner where you're supposed to talk to people, go over and talk to Putin, who his wife is seated with via the G20, just shows how dumb they think you are.
[00:56:41.157 --> 00:56:43.199]  But the good news is, no one's buying it!
[00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:46.441]  No one's buying that Islam's the religion of peace.
[00:56:46.882 --> 00:56:48.462]  No one's buying this isn't an invasion.
[00:56:48.742 --> 00:56:52.604]  No one's buying fighting an uphill battle against globalists, but still doing a great job.
[00:56:52.864 --> 00:56:59.608]  Ron Paul was on yesterday and said Trump's doing a great job, but fighting an uphill battle back against the wall, but that globalism is collapsing.
[00:56:59.848 --> 00:57:04.510]  See, they can try to destroy me or Trump or Ron Paul or Drudge or other leaders in the movement.
[00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:05.791]  They can't stop all of you.
[00:57:06.451 --> 00:57:09.234]  So they want to make examples out of us so other people won't stand up.
[00:57:09.454 --> 00:57:11.857]  The truth is our tide of liberty is coming in.
[00:57:12.077 --> 00:57:13.138]  Their tide's going out.
[00:57:13.618 --> 00:57:15.720]  But let MSM know what a joke they are.
[00:57:16.141 --> 00:57:17.042]  And CNN know.
[00:57:17.302 --> 00:57:20.806]  And talk radio know how crazy this is that a state dinner
[00:57:22.074 --> 00:57:26.077]  Our president isn't supposed to talk to Putin like he's evil and he's bad.
[00:57:26.137 --> 00:57:26.957]  What a mind game!
[00:57:27.238 --> 00:57:34.522]  President Trump needs to travel to Reykjavik and repeat what Reagan and Gorbachev did for, say, a three-day summit with Putin.
[00:57:35.043 --> 00:57:41.948]  And he should call out and say, they tried to create dirt here, they tried to paralyze me, they tried to tell me don't be associated with Putin, they tried to tell me
[00:57:42.924 --> 00:57:52.594]  I can't even talk to him at a state dinner when we're two superpowers with nuclear weapons that need to work together and have a lot of economic future together and they're becoming Christian and free market, something we ought to get back to.
[00:57:52.955 --> 00:58:05.207]  He ought to go and openly have an alliance with Russia for free market, an alliance against radical Islam, and an alliance against cultural Marxism, which Russia's fighting, and ought to have a huge summit and throw the gauntlet down in front of all of these trash.
[00:58:05.948 --> 00:58:17.011]  And let these garbage globalists know that they're not going to intimidate people with their alliance with Islam and their alliance with communism and communist China and their alliance with the corrupt globalist controlled Vatican.
[00:58:17.492 --> 00:58:19.172]  That's what America and Russia is fighting.
[00:58:19.212 --> 00:58:20.092]  We've got to come together.
[00:58:20.232 --> 00:58:21.953]  And the globalists are scared of that alliance.
[00:58:22.193 --> 00:58:31.076]  The Pope is scared of that alliance because it's the right alliance to make and complete Russia's journey towards freedom and have us get back to freedom as well.
[00:58:31.974 --> 00:58:32.855]  That's the bottom line.
[00:58:32.875 --> 00:58:40.222]  That shows how crazy these scumbags are that they think they can mind control you to where our president isn't even allowed to have dinner with people in public.
[00:58:40.483 --> 00:58:41.304]  It's a load of bull.
[00:58:41.604 --> 00:58:43.326]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:58:43.566 --> 00:58:44.987]  Back to Owen Schroer and David Knight.
