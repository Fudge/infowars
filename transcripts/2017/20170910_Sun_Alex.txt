[00:00:09.147 --> 00:00:14.492]  The globalist's great error is to believe that as they collapse humanity, they end up on top.
[00:00:16.013 --> 00:00:22.518]  The truth is, humanity is coming down fast, but we're miles above them, on our journey to hell.
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.502]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:44.824]  First the Eastern Caribbean, then Cuba, now Naples, Florida.
[00:00:44.884 --> 00:01:01.553]  Marcos Island have been wrecked as the storm has come on the edge of the shore at a Category 3 and is pushing a huge storm surge up towards Tampa, set to hit there with its full intensity in the next six hours, but already causing four and five foot storm surge in.
[00:01:01.613 --> 00:01:04.755]  But it is not a biblical megastorm like it was
[00:01:05.795 --> 00:01:22.467]  Five, six days ago out in the Eastern Caribbean, where it would take prosperous islands with large concrete hotel structures and flatten them, making islands uninhabitable, like Barbado and others.
[00:01:24.377 --> 00:01:34.279]  So we're going to be tracking all of this today as it unfolds, but a strong hurricane slamming in to southern western Florida.
[00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.781]  But it's covering the entire state and is set more and more to go westerly.
[00:01:39.841 --> 00:01:48.423]  In fact, some paths have it going ahead after it hits Tampa, bouncing out to sea and could go up towards the Panhandle, Louisiana, Mississippi, or even Texas.
[00:01:48.463 --> 00:01:49.743]  But most tracks show it going up.
[00:01:51.325 --> 00:01:55.488]  The western side up into Georgia, up into the Carolinas.
[00:01:55.769 --> 00:01:56.589]  Here's the problem.
[00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:07.238]  The tracks that they had going back two weeks ago, a week ago, three days ago, two days ago, none of them were right.
[00:02:10.077 --> 00:02:14.958]  The tracks always showed it going out in the Atlantic or up the East Coast, and then the last few days going up the center of the state.
[00:02:15.458 --> 00:02:22.499]  And then now they show it going westerly, but staying along the westerly side, with some now saying, oh, maybe it's going to track out to sea.
[00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:30.100]  But my experience with Katrina and so many others, it sits out in the eastern Atlantic, heats up, comes in, runs along the bottom of Florida.
[00:02:30.841 --> 00:02:38.662]  Katrina sat there for like three days, just spinning off the coast, and then zipped on over, as we all witnessed.
[00:02:42.327 --> 00:02:47.973]  This gives us a unique opportunity, while the public is paying attention to weather, to point out a couple big things.
[00:02:48.354 --> 00:03:01.328]  We have the UN, we have Al Gore, we have the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, we have Obama and all the folks who are invested in the carbon tax swindle, the big Hollywood folks as well, George Clooney's, saying it's your fault this happened.
[00:03:02.116 --> 00:03:13.983]  Even though back in the time of Christopher Columbus, they reported on storms in the Caribbean and storms in the southern United States that would knock over every tree when they made landfall.
[00:03:14.344 --> 00:03:16.165]  I've not seen a storm that knocks down every tree.
[00:03:17.762 --> 00:03:19.143]  So we know about megastorms.
[00:03:19.163 --> 00:03:20.584]  Sometimes it would go on for weeks.
[00:03:20.624 --> 00:03:26.147]  That would be, of course, two or three hurricanes or cyclones right behind each other.
[00:03:26.488 --> 00:03:35.133]  Like we're seeing with Irma, and we've got Jose, and then we've got, what, Tatia out in the Western Caribbean spinning around?
[00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:37.474]  Tatia, Tatia.
[00:03:38.115 --> 00:03:39.196]  I can't pronounce anything right.
[00:03:40.636 --> 00:03:41.097]  How do you say it?
[00:03:42.598 --> 00:03:44.039]  Katia, with a K, thank you.
[00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:46.020]  I don't have a teleprompter.
[00:03:46.937 --> 00:03:49.818]  But they do occasionally pop in my ear when I'm getting something wrong.
[00:03:50.178 --> 00:03:51.219]  So that's always good.
[00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.960]  But hey, I'm pretty good to get all these hurricane names right without a teleprompter.
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.641]  It kind of trains you to be focused.
[00:03:56.661 --> 00:04:03.143]  But I'm not too good on my Russian names, even though I supposedly get my orders from Vladimir Putin.
[00:04:04.504 --> 00:04:07.065]  Now getting serious, we have some amazing guests today.
[00:04:07.085 --> 00:04:07.905]  When I say amazing,
[00:04:09.582 --> 00:04:13.427]  There's been a lot of new big developments the last few years in the area of geoengineering.
[00:04:13.968 --> 00:04:18.894]  Namely, that planetary weather control projects have been admitted by governments.
[00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:27.325]  Russia, China, Dubai, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, even South American countries are admitting it.
[00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:32.639]  They always make fun of it in our news, and that's because the United States leads it.
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.822]  So there's been some big new developments.
[00:04:34.842 --> 00:04:40.509]  One of the leading researchers on this, Dane Whittington, is going to be joining us in the second hour.
[00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:45.556]  Stan Dayob, amazing earthquake expert, one of the best tracking records out there.
[00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:50.297]  Being able to predict earthquakes is going to get into why we saw the record earthquake a few days ago in Mexico.
[00:04:50.317 --> 00:04:53.918]  8.1, 8.3, depending on the raper scale report we see.
[00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:55.418]  That's the strongest ever recorded in Mexico.
[00:04:55.438 --> 00:05:01.720]  We're going to look at that and just talk about these huge developments dealing with the deep state and its deep projects.
[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:04.401]  He trolled them.
[00:05:05.541 --> 00:05:06.001]  He baited them.
[00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:16.530]  That's the Trump dimension.
[00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.131]  That's the Trump dimension.
[00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:18.631]  He trolled.
[00:05:18.731 --> 00:05:19.752]  That's the Trump dimension.
[00:05:19.772 --> 00:05:20.132]  He baited.
[00:05:20.172 --> 00:05:21.393]  That's, that's the Trump dimension.
[00:05:21.413 --> 00:05:21.893]  He trolled.
[00:05:21.993 --> 00:05:23.054]  That's the Trump dimension.
[00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:23.534]  He trolled.
[00:05:23.554 --> 00:05:24.675]  That's the Trump dimension.
[00:05:24.695 --> 00:05:25.135]  He trolled.
[00:05:25.175 --> 00:05:26.316]  That's the Trump dimension.
[00:05:26.336 --> 00:05:26.776]  He baited.
[00:05:26.876 --> 00:05:27.997]  I wish I was that smart.
[00:05:28.017 --> 00:05:29.618]  That's, that's the Trump dimension.
[00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:32.139]  It's, it's Trump.
[00:05:34.481 --> 00:05:35.321]  The plan of Trump.
[00:05:37.302 --> 00:05:38.683]  And thus by extension Trump.
[00:05:41.625 --> 00:05:43.386]  Trump just trolled you.
[00:05:43.566 --> 00:05:44.367]  But that's okay!
[00:05:51.275 --> 00:05:54.297]  Be one, you're strong!
[00:06:13.903 --> 00:06:18.054]  Defending the republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:06:18.776 --> 00:06:20.381]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.201]  Dane Wigington, just one of the best researchers out there.
[00:06:32.221 --> 00:06:40.683]  He's a scientist engineer into geoengineering and weather modification is going to be joining us coming up in the second hour.
[00:06:41.243 --> 00:06:43.244]  Stan Dayo is going to pop in at the bottom of the hour.
[00:06:43.324 --> 00:06:46.805]  One of the top, he's an engineer with many letters behind his name, but one of the top
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.620]  We're good.
[00:07:06.221 --> 00:07:11.826]  Earthquakes and typhoons and hurricanes tied into that historically.
[00:07:11.906 --> 00:07:13.587]  That is all coming up.
[00:07:13.607 --> 00:07:18.972]  Because I don't want to just sit here and look at an event like this and say, oh, let's pay Al Gore some carbon taxes.
[00:07:19.653 --> 00:07:20.533]  You know, let's say that...
[00:07:22.415 --> 00:07:30.439]  This is all man-made by individuals without looking at the fact that it's been the sun historically and the science shows this.
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:36.302]  We had an astrophysicist on earlier today before I did my standard Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:38.103]  We've been live since 9 a.m.
[00:07:38.123 --> 00:07:46.568]  this morning, myself and Leanne McAdoo and Owen Schroyer and of course David Knight and much of the crew and we had a very esteemed
[00:07:47.328 --> 00:07:52.832]  Uh, physicist on, astrophysicist from Harvard, getting into how the sun is the main driver.
[00:07:52.852 --> 00:07:56.955]  We're going to be airing some excerpts of that towards the end of the broadcast as well.
[00:07:56.975 --> 00:08:00.638]  Uh, our own Millie Weaver hosting for two hours interviewed him.
[00:08:00.738 --> 00:08:01.919]  Very powerful information.
[00:08:02.239 --> 00:08:04.841]  The sun is more than 99% of the climate.
[00:08:06.262 --> 00:08:10.866]  Uh, you know, whenever I say the sun's much bigger than the earth, I'll throw out how many, how many
[00:08:12.332 --> 00:08:21.779]  Planet Earth's it would take just to fill up the surface of the Sun, but not the actual entire volume of the Sun.
[00:08:21.879 --> 00:08:26.383]  So, will you guys pull up for me how many Earths can fit into the Sun?
[00:08:27.303 --> 00:08:28.544]  Just to give you guys an example.
[00:08:28.624 --> 00:08:29.925]  It's an astronomical number.
[00:08:29.965 --> 00:08:31.146]  I don't want to get it wrong from memory.
[00:08:31.687 --> 00:08:34.809]  But imagine the UN and mainline meteorologists.
[00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:37.471]  They had a UN vote seven years ago.
[00:08:40.293 --> 00:08:40.834]  Universal
[00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:46.453]  University Today, Universe Today, 1.3 million Earths.
[00:08:48.574 --> 00:08:53.898]  The answer is it would take 1.3 million, that's 1,300,000 Earths, to fill up the Sun.
[00:08:54.318 --> 00:08:55.319]  That's a lot of Earths!
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.043]  The Sun makes up 99.86% of the mass of the solar system.
[00:09:01.364 --> 00:09:08.008]  And it's giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn which make up most of the remaining 0.14% of the solar system.
[00:09:08.749 --> 00:09:12.332]  Do me a favor, print me that Universe Today article with the NASA data.
[00:09:13.482 --> 00:09:18.384]  So see, I just threw out something like, the sun is thousands of times bigger than the earth.
[00:09:19.885 --> 00:09:21.566]  And I said that on air today and I was like, wait a minute.
[00:09:23.606 --> 00:09:25.647]  Jupiter's like 300 times.
[00:09:26.808 --> 00:09:28.188]  Isn't Saturn 90 times?
[00:09:28.409 --> 00:09:29.489]  Let's just see if my memory's right.
[00:09:29.789 --> 00:09:30.349]  Probably isn't.
[00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:37.833]  And then I started thinking, wait, they admit you could put hundreds and hundreds of Jupiters in the sun.
[00:09:39.298 --> 00:09:47.724]  And you start looking at the numbers, it's no, it's tens of thousands of Jupiters and Saturns in the Sun, and all the other planets, because it's .14.
[00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:57.631]  So imagine, 1.3 million, third rock from the Sun, planet Earth, terra firma, 1.3 million.
[00:10:00.563 --> 00:10:01.103]  And we are.
[00:10:01.824 --> 00:10:06.507]  Third rock out, it's Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars.
[00:10:06.748 --> 00:10:07.608]  It goes out from there.
[00:10:08.109 --> 00:10:17.456]  And they're telling us the Sun has nothing to do with climate, even though we have the hurricanes, and we have summer, when we're tilted towards the Sun.
[00:10:20.838 --> 00:10:24.401]  And then on the bottom of the Earth, when it's tilted around, it gets
[00:10:25.848 --> 00:10:27.689]  More sun for part of the year.
[00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:30.730]  Now, this is incontrovertible fact!
[00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:35.012]  It is the sun that heats more than 99% of the Earth.
[00:10:35.312 --> 00:10:36.273]  What heats the rest of it?
[00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:41.035]  Thermal vents they account for, let's test my memory, less than 1%.
[00:10:41.796 --> 00:10:50.900]  Thermal vents, volcanic heat that makes it up to the crust of the Earth, into the ocean mainly, and some volcanoes on the surface,
[00:10:53.214 --> 00:10:59.759]  Subterranean volcanoes, undersea volcanoes, above-ground volcanoes.
[00:10:59.779 --> 00:11:03.461]  You've got a lot of volcanic heat that comes up through hot water and springs.
[00:11:03.882 --> 00:11:13.028]  So you've got volcanoes under the ground, or you've got fissures down on the earth into magma, and then you've got the above-ground volcanoes, and then you've got the undersea volcanoes in the Big Pacific Rim and other areas.
[00:11:13.389 --> 00:11:14.850]  And that's the main thing
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.962]  Other than the sun heating the earth, and it's less than 1%.
[00:11:19.583 --> 00:11:20.163]  It's estimated.
[00:11:20.744 --> 00:11:25.969]  So, the sun is the main system heating the earth.
[00:11:28.532 --> 00:11:30.534]  And in the summer, we have the hurricanes.
[00:11:31.395 --> 00:11:36.780]  Into the early fall, because the water gets the hottest towards the end of the summer, and even as it cools a little bit,
[00:11:37.583 --> 00:11:41.385]  Still, it takes time for that mass of water to dissipate that heat energy.
[00:11:41.445 --> 00:11:42.246]  I'm no scientist.
[00:11:42.466 --> 00:11:43.607]  This is all just admitted fact.
[00:11:43.807 --> 00:11:55.714]  But the UN, seven years ago, because all these scientists were coming out, astrophysicists from Harvard and other places, and were saying, what you're doing is a fraud, saying it's man-made and it's carbon dioxide.
[00:11:55.734 --> 00:11:56.895]  We are such a small effect.
[00:11:56.955 --> 00:11:57.875]  It's mainly the sun.
[00:11:58.215 --> 00:11:59.356]  They said, no, we don't want to hear that.
[00:11:59.396 --> 00:12:01.958]  So they had a vote at the Copenhagen event at the UN.
[00:12:03.029 --> 00:12:12.454]  They were meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark for the treaty, for world government, carbon tax treaty, to track everything we do and taxes and make us pay money to private central banks anytime we did any human activity.
[00:12:13.935 --> 00:12:15.255]  Total global feudalist system.
[00:12:15.295 --> 00:12:28.102]  And they said at that event, we have voted with the UN scientists, the hand-picked ones, that the sun has no effect on climate, key word, change.
[00:12:30.043 --> 00:12:45.146]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is an absolute fact that when the sun goes into these heating cycles and dormant cycles, that are roughly 11 to 12 year cycles, then it has super cycles, 120 year cycles, that the sun heats up and the sun heats down.
[00:12:45.627 --> 00:12:47.487]  The sun heats up, the sun heats down.
[00:12:47.787 --> 00:12:51.528]  When it's heating up, when it's having more thermal nuclear explosions inside of it,
[00:12:52.401 --> 00:12:54.385]  But at such a mass, it contains those explosions.
[00:12:54.765 --> 00:13:01.257]  Some of it ripples out on the surface as solar flares, as coronal mass ejections.
[00:13:02.711 --> 00:13:05.993]  And those fly out towards the earth with all their heat.
[00:13:06.213 --> 00:13:07.213]  You feel it when you're outside.
[00:13:07.313 --> 00:13:08.234]  Not a conspiracy theory.
[00:13:08.834 --> 00:13:09.934]  You feel it outside.
[00:13:10.274 --> 00:13:11.495]  The plants live off of it.
[00:13:11.515 --> 00:13:12.155]  Photosynthesis.
[00:13:12.636 --> 00:13:15.877]  And when we're pointed towards the sun, leaning towards it, we have the summer.
[00:13:16.617 --> 00:13:18.518]  And as we turn away, we go to the fall.
[00:13:18.578 --> 00:13:20.479]  When we're really turned away, we're the winter.
[00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:22.720]  As we turn back in, it's the spring.
[00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:23.901]  And it's the summer.
[00:13:25.241 --> 00:13:27.843]  I know 99% of you are saying, Jones, we know all this.
[00:13:27.863 --> 00:13:29.083]  2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:13:29.383 --> 00:13:30.324]  Well, under the
[00:13:31.937 --> 00:13:33.927]  Programming one of the public schools with Obama?
[00:13:35.404 --> 00:13:39.286]  They said that 2 plus 2 does not always equal 4 under Common Core.
[00:13:39.567 --> 00:13:43.149]  So they're engineering mass voodoo, mass mental illness.
[00:13:43.789 --> 00:13:53.696]  Whenever Christians say, oh, we're having hurricanes and tornadoes because of sodomy or something, people say, oh, you're a bunch of voodoo crazies, a bunch of superstitious.
[00:13:53.736 --> 00:14:03.722]  But then when Jennifer Lawrence, who I'm going to play when we come back, when she comes out and says that it is the fault of people voting Trump, Irma,
[00:14:05.373 --> 00:14:09.434]  And Harvey, the Hollywood goes wild and says yes!
[00:14:09.994 --> 00:14:16.835]  And then they have the more pseudoscience version, the CNN and the New York Times have people on there going, yes, this is global warming man-made.
[00:14:16.895 --> 00:14:18.716]  We're paying for it from Mother Nature.
[00:14:20.156 --> 00:14:25.317]  So they're telling you that you're individually geoengineering everything.
[00:14:27.398 --> 00:14:29.978]  Individually in the aggregate, you're bad.
[00:14:30.858 --> 00:14:32.939]  But governments aren't geoengineering.
[00:14:32.979 --> 00:14:33.719]  But here's the problem.
[00:14:35.529 --> 00:14:42.154]  Just like they had the Manhattan Project for four years, totally secret, hundreds of thousands of people involved, compartmentalized.
[00:14:44.296 --> 00:14:53.542]  No one knew, even when they tested an atomic bomb out in the desert in the United States, they just told folks all that was some thunder.
[00:14:54.463 --> 00:14:55.544]  Never mind, go away.
[00:14:57.265 --> 00:15:00.868]  Until they dropped A-bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.
[00:15:03.097 --> 00:15:06.518]  Now, that's a 1900 equation that gave us atomic bombs.
[00:15:07.239 --> 00:15:16.243]  Even the backwards North Koreans that can't even build their own cars or make their own toilet paper, they know how to make hydrogen bombs now because the Clintons and others gave them the technology.
[00:15:18.003 --> 00:15:22.926]  So imagine if they did that back in the 40s, what do they got cooking now?
[00:15:23.026 --> 00:15:24.166]  Well, here's the difference.
[00:15:24.306 --> 00:15:25.647]  They act like you're dumb animals.
[00:15:26.601 --> 00:15:33.348]  The globalists, the social engineers, the academics go have conferences, admit they're geoengineering, admit they're spraying, admit they're doing it all.
[00:15:33.849 --> 00:15:34.970]  Then they hire comedians.
[00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:37.012]  Globalist system is ridiculous.
[00:15:37.032 --> 00:15:44.780]  They hire all the top comedians to go on all the shows and attack and make up stuff that I've never said that didn't say there's no such thing as geoengineering.
[00:15:45.581 --> 00:15:59.381]  So that you never have a debate about it and stay like an ignorant savage, while they just move on and take full control of the weather, which is something you know governments signed a treaty in 1978 to do secretly amongst themselves, but to not tell the public.
[00:15:59.401 --> 00:16:01.685]  You're gonna see it all, the proof coming up!
[00:16:13.888 --> 00:16:14.588]  How did he get in here?
[00:16:14.628 --> 00:16:17.090]  He's supposed to be with a few people outside.
[00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:24.914]  How about... How about all week they're talking about the masks, the gloves, that are gonna be outside.
[00:16:24.954 --> 00:16:25.674]  Where are they?
[00:16:25.814 --> 00:16:26.515]  Oh, it's hot out.
[00:16:26.635 --> 00:16:27.415]  It is hot.
[00:16:27.515 --> 00:16:29.296]  I think it's too warm.
[00:16:29.836 --> 00:16:39.121]  You know, they show up with the helmets and the black masks, and they've got gloves, and they've got everything.
[00:16:39.321 --> 00:16:40.062]  Antifa!
[00:17:13.519 --> 00:17:14.279]  How did he get in here?
[00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:16.600]  He's supposed to be with a few people outside.
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:23.981]  How about... How about all week we're talking about the massive crowds that are going to be outside.
[00:17:24.061 --> 00:17:25.062]  We're not.
[00:17:25.162 --> 00:17:26.202]  Well, it's hot out.
[00:17:26.522 --> 00:17:27.102]  It is hot.
[00:17:27.182 --> 00:17:29.183]  I think it's too warm.
[00:17:29.463 --> 00:17:35.464]  You know, they show up with the helmets and the black masks.
[00:17:35.644 --> 00:17:38.805]  And they've got gloves and they've got everything.
[00:17:38.985 --> 00:17:39.725]  Antifa!

[00:19:20.936 --> 00:19:22.697]  I think so.
[00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:53.690]  I mean that's that's what we're dealing with here and I'm sick of it!
[00:19:55.972 --> 00:20:01.555]  Bing bing bong bong bing bing bing!
[00:20:06.698 --> 00:20:09.339]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:23.138 --> 00:20:25.780]  Solar superstorms are now slamming into the Earth.
[00:20:27.141 --> 00:20:35.566]  They're directly tied to increased storm power as they ionize the atmosphere, creating more particula for water droplets to form.
[00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:42.751]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:20:43.271 --> 00:20:48.475]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:20:50.756 --> 00:20:51.537]  The secrets
[00:20:53.502 --> 00:20:58.256]  Of hurricanes, weather modification, geoengineering, and the sun.
[00:20:59.568 --> 00:21:08.910]  The Globalists don't want you to know we're covering it all here live on this Sunday transmission during a 13-hour special broadcast.
[00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:10.471]  That's right, we started at 9 a.m.
[00:21:10.511 --> 00:21:14.271]  this morning and we're going until past 10 o'clock tonight.
[00:21:14.732 --> 00:21:20.933]  When I'm done at 6 o'clock Central, Rob Dew and of course Michael Zimmerman are both going to be hosting.
[00:21:21.793 --> 00:21:24.534]  The earth is right in the Goldilocks zone.
[00:21:25.424 --> 00:21:28.867]  Too close to the sun, you'd be like Venus or Mercury.
[00:21:29.287 --> 00:21:31.328]  Too far away, you'd be like Mars.
[00:21:31.428 --> 00:21:34.791]  Too cold, not able to hold an atmosphere.
[00:21:35.071 --> 00:21:36.752]  We're right in the perfect spot.
[00:21:37.693 --> 00:21:42.597]  Why would the UN vote seven years ago to say the sun has no effect on climate change?
[00:21:43.427 --> 00:21:45.268]  Because they want to blame you.
[00:21:45.969 --> 00:21:52.674]  And they want to play God and sell you on the idea that they can control weather.
[00:21:52.914 --> 00:22:00.921]  But only after they blamed you for the problems, then you've got to have a global tax for global geoengineering.
[00:22:02.302 --> 00:22:03.703]  My great frustration is this.
[00:22:05.444 --> 00:22:09.487]  I have read 60-page Council on Foreign Relations reports.
[00:22:10.328 --> 00:22:12.170]  I've read 30-plus page
[00:22:13.271 --> 00:22:13.571]  U.N.
[00:22:13.611 --> 00:22:14.052]  reports.
[00:22:15.052 --> 00:22:18.095]  I have read 400-page books on geoengineering.
[00:22:18.135 --> 00:22:23.999]  I've interviewed the father of weather weapons when it was declassified in 2006, and then he got a visit from the government.
[00:22:24.259 --> 00:22:25.820]  Ben Levinson would do no more interviews.
[00:22:27.201 --> 00:22:30.463]  And he's admittedly the former head of the Air Force program.
[00:22:32.485 --> 00:22:34.066]  And I'm informed, but
[00:22:35.148 --> 00:22:40.352]  Mainstream media will say, Jones says the tornado was sent by Obama that hit Oklahoma City.
[00:22:40.532 --> 00:22:41.173]  Never said that.
[00:22:41.673 --> 00:22:46.437]  Or Jones says there's giant wasps living under the UN building.
[00:22:46.637 --> 00:22:47.237]  Never said that.
[00:22:47.477 --> 00:22:49.979]  These are quotes from Rachel Maddow and others.
[00:22:50.019 --> 00:22:58.266]  And then even people I know, people that say they're my friends who are on TV and radio will go, yeah, Jones kind of gets out there saying there's giant wasps under the
[00:22:59.468 --> 00:23:00.128]  You inbuilding her.
[00:23:00.449 --> 00:23:03.050]  Jones kind of gets out there saying there's slave colonies on Mars.
[00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:05.631]  I called up one friend and I said, uh, I'll give you $100,000.
[00:23:05.671 --> 00:23:08.593]  You can show me saying that on video or audio over it.
[00:23:08.673 --> 00:23:09.453]  You can't find it.
[00:23:09.733 --> 00:23:10.574]  It's a lie.
[00:23:13.055 --> 00:23:14.036]  I have a stack.
[00:23:14.716 --> 00:23:16.577]  It doesn't hurt me that I'm being attacked.
[00:23:16.617 --> 00:23:24.001]  In fact, it makes me more popular, more successful, but they're building this big straw man of me.
[00:23:26.385 --> 00:23:42.305]  And so as they build this giant fake straw man to try to attack the human awakening and create that as a symbol, try to make me a symbol of falsity, the shadow of the giant lie they've built makes my operation, who I really am, bigger for those that actually come and find us.
[00:23:43.899 --> 00:23:47.462]  But see, there's a race to build this big, giant Alex Jones.
[00:23:47.502 --> 00:23:56.671]  I mean, seven TV shows airing weekly, some five nights a week in primetime slots, where the host is supposedly me, and they say the most racist, horrible crap.
[00:23:57.231 --> 00:24:00.695]  And one episode is, I'm Alex Jones, and I hate people with long hair.
[00:24:01.578 --> 00:24:03.199]  And they just repeat jokes about long hair.
[00:24:04.039 --> 00:24:07.101]  And then people with long hair suddenly see me and go, F you man!
[00:24:07.782 --> 00:24:08.322]  Never said it!
[00:24:08.802 --> 00:24:10.984]  In the next episode, Alex Jones hates gays.
[00:24:11.404 --> 00:24:12.885]  And goes through things I've supposedly said.
[00:24:13.265 --> 00:24:14.406]  Alex Jones hates blacks.
[00:24:14.606 --> 00:24:15.286]  Remember Alec Baldwin?
[00:24:16.707 --> 00:24:18.268]  Playing the part of the president on Saturday Night Live?
[00:24:18.688 --> 00:24:20.850]  I'm Alec, I'm President Trump.
[00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.231]  I don't like black people, they're not humans.
[00:24:23.611 --> 00:24:25.332]  I learned it from Alex Jones.
[00:24:25.753 --> 00:24:27.694]  InfoWars.com, Alex Jones.
[00:24:29.275 --> 00:24:30.496]  Now, why would you do that?
[00:24:30.676 --> 00:24:32.797]  Because they think their viewers are idiots.
[00:24:33.417 --> 00:24:37.739]  And they're inoculating them psychologically.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.681]  Every episode, I hate women.
[00:24:41.641 --> 00:24:43.822]  They'll even cut this out, but I don't care, they're deceivers.
[00:24:44.583 --> 00:24:48.665]  They say, I say, I hate women, I hate gays, I hate trannies.
[00:24:49.325 --> 00:24:52.627]  Or they say, oh that's the proper term, you know, use trans, Alex, you're being hateful.
[00:24:53.287 --> 00:24:53.927]  There's no way to win.
[00:24:54.948 --> 00:24:57.129]  I hate black people, I hate Hispanics.
[00:24:58.615 --> 00:25:01.078]  And they just continue to put it out.
[00:25:01.118 --> 00:25:07.326]  In fact, if a new listener tuned in, they're probably thinking, come on, Alec Baldwin didn't come out and say, those aren't humans, those are black people.
[00:25:07.347 --> 00:25:09.589]  I learned it from Alex Jones, okay?
[00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:10.871]  Maybe you can cue that up.
[00:25:10.911 --> 00:25:11.612]  People won't believe that.
[00:25:11.872 --> 00:25:15.557]  I mean, it's every show, but it's not like a couple of Saturday Night Live's attacked me.
[00:25:16.318 --> 00:25:21.259]  It's two shows they've got on Comedy Central every day attacking, or five days a week.
[00:25:21.739 --> 00:25:23.500]  It's two shows on HBO.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:24.980]  It's a Showtime show.
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:26.420]  And it's a bunch of other ones.
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:27.940]  I mean, it's everywhere.
[00:25:28.501 --> 00:25:28.861]  Why?
[00:25:30.301 --> 00:25:33.742]  If you know the answer to that, you'll know how to defeat them.
[00:25:34.282 --> 00:25:37.122]  Because I do one thing that anybody else could do.
[00:25:40.203 --> 00:25:44.464]  I go out to the actual white papers from MIT, NOAA,
[00:25:45.964 --> 00:25:55.486]  The major corporations, the defense industries, all of them, they all want to brag about what they've done to shareholders, or they want to brag to other scientists so they will thinly couch this stuff.
[00:25:56.803 --> 00:25:59.465]  But they admit they're already trying to geoengineer the whole planet.
[00:25:59.605 --> 00:26:01.886]  I don't think they have full control because the sun's so powerful.
[00:26:02.226 --> 00:26:06.169]  That's why they're actually in competition with the sun and mad that they're not God.
[00:26:06.189 --> 00:26:11.152]  And I'm not saying the sun's God, but if you were an atheist, it might as well be your God.
[00:26:11.172 --> 00:26:19.057]  Because they say in like 10 minutes, the surface would be freezing if the sun's full radiation didn't happen, you know, say high noon.
[00:26:20.233 --> 00:26:26.716]  Within days, it'd be absolute zero through much of the Earth, but still the core would be molten for a while.
[00:26:27.276 --> 00:26:34.239]  The Sun is 1.3 million times bigger than terra firma, than this planetoid we're on.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.340]  It's the driver.
[00:26:37.141 --> 00:26:44.364]  And they're trying to manipulate, but all they can do is nudge and already take weather systems that the Sun has created, and then try to control those.
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:53.322]  But coming up, I'm going to go over the latest with the hurricane and so much more, and we have some special guests joining us, but I'm going to show you if you're a TV viewer.
[00:26:54.182 --> 00:26:58.123]  For radio listeners, these are all posted on Infowars.com, but you don't have to believe me.
[00:26:58.143 --> 00:27:12.607]  You can go to DepartmentofDefense.gov, and you can read DOD News Briefing Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen briefing them on their new weather weapons and their tectonic earthquake and volcano weapons.
[00:27:13.953 --> 00:27:15.794]  You might want to read that for yourself.
[00:27:16.655 --> 00:27:18.016]  It's right there in the report.
[00:27:18.056 --> 00:27:19.277]  We're going to go over that for you.
[00:27:19.857 --> 00:27:20.638]  We're going to continue.
[00:27:20.718 --> 00:27:20.898]  U.S.
[00:27:20.958 --> 00:27:25.301]  Air Force has dispatched its air sprayer, C-130, to Texas in response to Hurricane Harvey.
[00:27:25.321 --> 00:27:26.462]  They can do weather modification.
[00:27:26.722 --> 00:27:27.742]  They can do chemical cleanup.
[00:27:27.762 --> 00:27:29.324]  They can also do anti-mosquito spray.
[00:27:29.924 --> 00:27:31.725]  And they're massively increasing the fleet of them.
[00:27:31.745 --> 00:27:32.826]  The point is, it's going on.
[00:27:34.407 --> 00:27:35.688]  The average person is departmentalized.
[00:27:35.708 --> 00:27:36.709]  They don't even know the full mission.
[00:27:37.634 --> 00:27:38.014]  Systems.
[00:27:38.434 --> 00:27:43.336]  Council on Foreign Relations Developing an International Framework for Geoengineering.
[00:27:43.737 --> 00:27:44.197]  That's from 2010.
[00:27:45.437 --> 00:27:48.198]  Seven years ago.
[00:27:48.759 --> 00:27:50.439]  It's a 60-plus page report.
[00:27:50.579 --> 00:27:51.600]  I suggest you read it.
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.921]  Oh, here's one from last year, June 29th.
[00:27:55.321 --> 00:28:06.426]  Central Intelligence Agency News and Information press release with the Director Brennan speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations about their ongoing program for world government and total geoengineering program.
[00:28:06.906 --> 00:28:08.727]  I suggest you might want to read it for yourself.
[00:28:09.467 --> 00:28:10.027]  Let's continue.
[00:28:10.067 --> 00:28:11.768]  That's at CIA.gov, by the way.
[00:28:12.308 --> 00:28:13.329]  Oh, here's another one.
[00:28:13.609 --> 00:28:16.810]  But again, just have a few comedians come out and laugh at me.
[00:28:17.691 --> 00:28:20.612]  See, all the intellectuals, though, they're reading CIA.gov.
[00:28:20.852 --> 00:28:22.153]  They're reading The Atlantic.
[00:28:23.113 --> 00:28:24.734]  They're reading CFR.
[00:28:24.774 --> 00:28:26.815]  They're reading about, oh, the company's doing it.
[00:28:26.835 --> 00:28:33.958]  And now Dubai and Qatar and Russia and China are all doing it with ground-based electromagnetic systems to control the weather.
[00:28:34.158 --> 00:28:35.158]  Here's the Atlantic Monthly.
[00:28:35.698 --> 00:28:36.939]  Re-engineering the Earth.
[00:28:37.179 --> 00:28:37.719]  Oh, yeah.
[00:28:38.199 --> 00:28:39.660]  Only the global governments do it, though.
[00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:40.540]  U.S.
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.500]  Air Force is dispatching its air sprayers.
[00:28:42.901 --> 00:28:44.461]  Here's another one.
[00:28:44.681 --> 00:28:47.002]  Reflecting upon 10 years of geoengineering research.
[00:28:47.782 --> 00:28:48.662]  Oh, we got a big report here.
[00:28:48.742 --> 00:28:49.182]  Climate.
[00:28:49.662 --> 00:28:54.044]  Cloud ionization, electric rainmaking, and laser-guided weather modification.
[00:28:54.744 --> 00:29:00.626]  And right as all this comes out, they got a big movie, Geostorm, coming out next month, right on time.
[00:29:00.806 --> 00:29:01.306]  Stay with us.
[00:29:02.995 --> 00:29:07.457]  I like to do things where I know I can at least take control of it myself, personally.
[00:29:08.797 --> 00:29:18.842]  And this isn't a pitch for water filtration, but we go out and find the very best gravity-fed water filters, where it takes out all the garbage, but doesn't take out the good minerals, and then I put my drinking water through that.
[00:29:19.942 --> 00:29:23.804]  And if I'm lazy, I've got reverse osmosis, which really cleans the water, but cuts out the minerals.
[00:29:24.084 --> 00:29:27.865]  So over time, it's probably not too good for you to only drink reverse osmosis.
[00:29:27.905 --> 00:29:28.946]  That's in all the studies.
[00:29:29.526 --> 00:29:31.807]  But the other big area is the shampoo.
[00:29:33.562 --> 00:29:40.827]  And the sunscreens and the cosmetics and the body washes and the soap, which isn't really soap.
[00:29:41.468 --> 00:29:48.693]  So we've spent, and this is a plug, but it's really informational until the bottom of the hour when Sheriff Arpaio joins us.
[00:29:49.093 --> 00:29:57.039]  We spent years saying we want to get an organic, high quality line of toiletries and personal care products.
[00:29:58.103 --> 00:30:02.545]  So that I can use them in my own home and know from the manufacturer, it's really what they say.
[00:30:03.385 --> 00:30:14.490]  And folks, we got Mark Gonsalves, the owner of Nature's Brands, one of the biggest organic brands in the country, one of the top sellers at Whole Foods.
[00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:16.971]  Everybody recognizes our labeling because he's so nice.
[00:30:17.331 --> 00:30:21.293]  He even let us use basically his labeling, but changed the name to Emmerich's Essentials.
[00:30:21.313 --> 00:30:25.815]  So whether you get it at Whole Foods under his name or from us, what's best about it is,
[00:30:27.651 --> 00:30:33.736]  It's on the low end of cost, but better than a lot of the other so-called organic brands, and it's so respected.
[00:30:33.756 --> 00:30:35.918]  But I wanted to get him on because he's the expert.
[00:30:36.559 --> 00:30:43.745]  He's got a bunch of the brands there of what's in some of the other leading brands and some of the other supposed natural brands that really aren't organic.
[00:30:43.785 --> 00:30:46.147]  But Emmerich Essentials is Nature's brand.
[00:30:46.327 --> 00:30:48.589]  We're under a chemical assault.
[00:30:48.949 --> 00:30:50.411]  It's unbelievable to me.
[00:30:51.212 --> 00:30:52.735]  What we've allowed to take place.
[00:30:52.936 --> 00:30:57.064]  We've got 84,000 chemicals now in play.
[00:30:57.524 --> 00:31:00.891]  13,000 of which are used in our cosmetics and personal care items.
[00:31:00.951 --> 00:31:02.734]  And we use these things every single day.
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.302]  Yet about 10% have ever been tested.
[00:31:06.742 --> 00:31:14.268]  So we always rely on the chemical company to be able to be considered innocent until we end up proving them guilty.
[00:31:14.329 --> 00:31:15.630]  Does that make any sense at all?
[00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:21.254]  So all these things that we put on our body, they're going into our bloodstream.
[00:31:21.534 --> 00:31:24.777]  Takes about 28 seconds to go into our bloodstream.
[00:31:24.997 --> 00:31:26.158]  So here's what we've got.
[00:31:26.418 --> 00:31:28.420]  We've got the FDA that says, hey, you know what?
[00:31:29.068 --> 00:31:30.549]  For external use only.
[00:31:30.569 --> 00:31:31.489]  Think about this.
[00:31:31.569 --> 00:31:32.149]  Think about this.
[00:31:32.169 --> 00:31:33.610]  They say it's for external use only.
[00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:35.210]  They're not stupid at the FDA.
[00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:37.611]  They know it goes into your bloodstream.
[00:31:38.251 --> 00:31:41.052]  What is the establishment going to do when all this comes out?
[00:31:41.292 --> 00:31:43.853]  It's already come out about bisphenol A and Adrazine.
[00:31:44.093 --> 00:31:45.573]  And then they're still putting it in stuff.
[00:31:45.674 --> 00:31:47.294]  What's going to happen?
[00:31:47.594 --> 00:31:49.555]  Why are they doing it when I've looked it up?
[00:31:49.595 --> 00:31:53.756]  They've got chemicals that are even less expensive that they could be using that have less problems.
[00:31:53.956 --> 00:31:55.577]  It's like they go out of their way to do this.
[00:31:56.717 --> 00:32:00.758]  I think that companies today, are they purposely trying to kill us?
[00:32:00.778 --> 00:32:06.640]  I don't know if I'm going to go quite that far, but what I will say is, they don't seem to care if they do.
[00:32:08.001 --> 00:32:08.881]  They don't seem to care.
[00:32:08.901 --> 00:32:09.361]  Exactly.
[00:32:09.721 --> 00:32:17.724]  Just like Bayer with the hemophiliac factor VIII, they knew it was in there, and they said, you know what, we'll lose money, go ahead and ship these millions of dosages.
[00:32:17.764 --> 00:32:18.304]  These didn't care.
[00:32:19.478 --> 00:32:20.418]  Exactly.
[00:32:20.479 --> 00:32:23.460]  Hey, as a young person, it was Ford with the Pintel, right?
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:26.381]  Oh yeah, well, we had 30 gas tanks that would blow up.
[00:32:26.401 --> 00:32:33.464]  Yeah, we'll get sued for millions and millions of dollars, but hey, at the end of the day, that's a heck of a lot cheaper than having to replace all those gas tanks in a recall.
[00:32:33.524 --> 00:32:35.825]  I mean, golly, we've got a business to protect.
[00:32:36.485 --> 00:32:39.987]  Again, when you place a person's well-being
[00:32:41.308 --> 00:32:48.613]  The bottom rung of the ladder and you place purely profit at the top, that is something seriously wrong.
[00:32:48.813 --> 00:32:49.774]  Well, we're really impressed.
[00:32:50.094 --> 00:32:50.994]  Mark, thank you so much.
[00:32:51.054 --> 00:32:52.055]  NaturesBrands.com.
[00:32:52.355 --> 00:33:00.960]  Folks can get their Emmerich's Essentials, private label by you, God bless you, at InfowarsStore.com, InfowarsLife.com, or AAA253-3139.
[00:33:01.181 --> 00:33:02.742]  Mark Gonzales, thank you so much, sir.
[00:33:06.904 --> 00:33:09.506]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:14.773 --> 00:33:19.615]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:19.996 --> 00:33:31.541]  Professor Will Soon of Harvard is one of the top astrophysicists in the world.
[00:33:42.586 --> 00:33:45.790]  And he was on with Millie Weaver about two hours ago.
[00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:53.100]  We're having live coverage all day until past 10 o'clock tonight, Central, as we cover Hurricane Irma as it makes landfall in Naples.
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:57.766]  It's now going up the coastline towards Tampa as a Category 3, hugging the coastline.
[00:33:59.189 --> 00:34:01.770]  We've got the sun that's 1.3 million times bigger than Earth.
[00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:05.071]  We know it's electromagnetic radiation, not just it's heat radiation.
[00:34:05.191 --> 00:34:07.532]  Effects goes into the core, bounces back off.
[00:34:08.073 --> 00:34:12.114]  We know thermal heat is less than 1% of the Earth's heat, the rest is the sun.
[00:34:12.794 --> 00:34:19.057]  And we know that there have been a lot of big earthquakes intensifying in the Pacific Rim, the Ring of Fire, you name it.
[00:34:19.477 --> 00:34:26.199]  Now, Stan Dayo is a scientist, researcher, worked in classified areas of some of the top corporations, the government, as well as the FBI.
[00:34:26.359 --> 00:34:35.241]  I remember hearing this guy 20 years ago with Art Bell, and he sounded credible, but I just couldn't believe, you know, the earthquake predictions until they kept coming true.
[00:34:35.261 --> 00:34:39.102]  Now, he was using government data that they had out on major sites.
[00:34:39.462 --> 00:34:40.322]  They took that down.
[00:34:40.382 --> 00:34:42.343]  He can still predict it with a lot of
[00:34:43.953 --> 00:34:44.794]  A lot of precision.
[00:34:45.374 --> 00:34:54.423]  And so I want to just get his take about, we know there's geoengineering going on, but they know how to kind of target things from our research that are already happening and just exacerbate it or make it weaker.
[00:34:55.023 --> 00:35:01.970]  But then you got the sun coming back out of a dormant cycle into a more prolific cycle.
[00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:05.273]  And then you see all the other earth changes.
[00:35:05.714 --> 00:35:08.877]  But why do we see megastorms like three
[00:35:10.174 --> 00:35:11.115]  Hurricanes right now.
[00:35:11.135 --> 00:35:14.317]  Irma, a week ago, 185 mile an hour winds.
[00:35:14.657 --> 00:35:18.779]  The only time it's ever been recorded in modern history at 185 miles an hour.
[00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:25.383]  Why historically, even back when ignorant savages could tell that when you had big storms you also had earthquakes.
[00:35:26.704 --> 00:35:28.505]  They've lost over 90 people that we know of.
[00:35:29.125 --> 00:35:30.486]  Gotta pray for those folks in Mexico.
[00:35:30.867 --> 00:35:34.349]  Strongest ever recorded in 100 years of seismographs down there.
[00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:36.871]  Now, finally, the L.A.
[00:35:36.891 --> 00:35:41.635]  Times is telling the public, get ready for a mega-quake, even though they're many years overdue, according to Standeo.
[00:35:42.095 --> 00:35:43.216]  And I looked at his own research.
[00:35:43.537 --> 00:35:47.400]  Now, top seismologists and others agree with him.
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:58.770]  So I wanted to get Standeo on to give us his larger, encompassed, researched view on why these changes, including political, are all happening globally at the same time.
[00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:59.811]  And the Romans wrote about
[00:36:00.291 --> 00:36:05.035]  It just seemed like there'd be volcanoes and suddenly there'd be wars or there'd be a big storm and there'd be a war.
[00:36:05.055 --> 00:36:07.297]  It just, it all seems to go together.
[00:36:07.337 --> 00:36:12.582]  You got North Korea and the hydrogen bombs and you've got, I mean, this, this quake that hit Mexico.
[00:36:12.622 --> 00:36:13.682]  That's one of the biggest recorded.
[00:36:14.557 --> 00:36:15.357]  Many, many years.
[00:36:15.377 --> 00:36:18.699]  I mean, just look at how huge it is compared to other big quakes that are happening.
[00:36:18.739 --> 00:36:22.321]  So, Stan Dayo, Stan Dayo, D-E-Y-O dot com.
[00:36:22.581 --> 00:36:23.982]  Amazing author, filmmaker.
[00:36:24.002 --> 00:36:27.004]  I'm not going to go over his whole bio, because we'll run out of time if we do.
[00:36:27.824 --> 00:36:33.587]  But we do have coming up, of course, astrophysicist and so much more to go over all this.
[00:36:34.308 --> 00:36:39.831]  Dane Wigington, absolutely on target about geoengineering, which more and more they're admitting is going on.
[00:36:40.131 --> 00:36:43.733]  So, Stan Dayo, thank you so much for taking time out with us on this Sunday evening.
[00:36:45.126 --> 00:36:46.127]  Thank you for the invitation.
[00:36:46.147 --> 00:36:47.889]  I follow Dane's work, too.
[00:36:47.969 --> 00:36:49.310]  It's really quite exceptional.
[00:36:49.691 --> 00:36:53.595]  I've sent him an email here recently just to tell him how good I thought his research was, or is.
[00:36:54.415 --> 00:36:56.678]  You were mentioning about a biblical quote.
[00:36:58.379 --> 00:37:02.724]  Somebody sent me this yesterday in relation to what's happening with the hurricanes and the sun and stuff.
[00:37:03.144 --> 00:37:03.945]  Luke 21, 3 verses 25 through 28.
[00:37:07.563 --> 00:37:23.609]  You can read it, or I can read it for you, but basically it says that there's going to be seas, distress, waves in the seas, roaring on the shores, distress in the sun, the moon, the stars, and the powers of heaven will be shaken, you know, like with... Oh, I forgot!
[00:37:23.649 --> 00:37:25.590]  We've got record solar storms right now, too.
[00:37:26.596 --> 00:37:29.357]  Oh yeah, we've had two in the last 72 hours.
[00:37:29.677 --> 00:37:33.117]  One at 8.2 occurred today and a 9.3 yesterday.
[00:37:33.617 --> 00:37:40.119]  And the spot that generated those is going to rotate around the Sun in its normal rotation period of 28 days.
[00:37:40.179 --> 00:37:47.240]  But we're going to see it become Earth-effective or Earth-directed on the 30th of September through the 2nd of October.
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:50.881]  So people could be watching that to see what happens again.
[00:37:50.941 --> 00:37:55.102]  If we get a direct burst from the Sun, it'll be like a halo coming at us.
[00:37:55.914 --> 00:37:56.314]  Well, perhaps.
[00:37:56.334 --> 00:38:01.379]  You know, as I say, the guidance systems, the GPS monitoring systems that we have up in geosynchronous orbits,
[00:38:20.305 --> 00:38:21.926]  are compromised by this to a degree.
[00:38:22.567 --> 00:38:27.130]  Most of them have been hardened, but they do warn you at NOAA and NASA that there might be some interruption of these things.
[00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:36.256]  And when you get that kind of an ejection, to be cautious of your GPS guidance systems, even in your car.
[00:38:37.105 --> 00:38:38.686]  So what do you make of all this?
[00:38:38.746 --> 00:38:43.448]  Because we know they're trying to control the weather, but just like the Manhattan Project, they're keeping it quasi-secret.
[00:38:43.808 --> 00:38:48.030]  But now they're suddenly admitting a lot of it, and then you've got all these increased storms.
[00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:49.030]  I mean, you're a smart guy.
[00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:50.251]  You worked in black projects.
[00:38:50.631 --> 00:38:52.412]  We don't mean poor black neighborhoods.
[00:38:52.652 --> 00:38:54.252]  You worked in secret projects, Dan Dayo.
[00:38:54.552 --> 00:38:55.733]  What do you think's really going on here?
[00:38:56.849 --> 00:39:00.650]  Well, look, in 1972, the U.S.
[00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:07.433]  government started drafting agreements with Russia to limit weather warfare, military uses of weather warfare.
[00:39:08.213 --> 00:39:12.715]  And it took them until 1978, six years to get the stuff approved to the Senate.
[00:39:13.667 --> 00:39:17.810]  Uh, and that was, what, uh, 30, 45 years ago.
[00:39:18.611 --> 00:39:25.235]  And, uh, I saw that you had something on your website, you were showing it, about what, uh, you can read at the government sites about weather warfare.
[00:39:25.396 --> 00:39:25.796]  Absolutely.
[00:39:25.816 --> 00:39:29.458]  In fact, they started it in 72, as you said, at Russia's insistence, because they knew we were doing it.
[00:39:29.518 --> 00:39:30.239]  They were doing it too.
[00:39:30.719 --> 00:39:32.100]  In 78, they ratified it.
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.021]  Other countries ratified it.
[00:39:33.041 --> 00:39:33.922]  It is global law.
[00:39:34.502 --> 00:39:41.164]  The Department of Defense admitted their earthquake, tectonic, and weather weapon program by the Secretary of Defense in the U.S.
[00:39:41.184 --> 00:39:42.464]  Department of Defense press release.
[00:39:43.184 --> 00:39:45.205]  That was in 1997, April 28th.
[00:39:45.245 --> 00:39:46.185]  I've got that on screen.
[00:39:46.625 --> 00:39:51.286]  I mean, what's crazy is they admitted all the academics, but then tell us it's not happening.
[00:39:52.467 --> 00:39:53.647]  We can also show folks the U.N.
[00:39:53.687 --> 00:39:53.987]  Treaty.
[00:39:54.487 --> 00:39:55.087]  Keep going, Stan.
[00:39:55.947 --> 00:40:01.709]  Okay, well the thing is, back then when they were designing the treaty and then eventually ratifying it,
[00:40:02.483 --> 00:40:19.996]  They were using stuff, say in Russia, of spreading black coal dust about an inch thick over the snow in Siberia to modify how much heat was absorbed into the land there and thus affect the long-range weather forecasts or patterns over Alaska and northern United States and Canada.
[00:40:20.457 --> 00:40:26.781]  That was a very simple form of it, but as you know, Dr. Teller did apply patents to
[00:40:27.962 --> 00:40:33.966]  Put particulates like barium and various other metal powders in the atmosphere to either reflect or absorb energy from the sun.
[00:40:34.546 --> 00:40:40.990]  At that time, it was obvious to us that the sun was the major driver to global heating, not just warming, heating.
[00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:51.897]  And this has occurred in our past geological record so many times, it's not funny, long before humans were on the Earth with manufacturing complexes creating the heat they're talking about now.
[00:40:52.197 --> 00:40:55.099]  So this is not due to human effort, as you were saying.
[00:40:55.279 --> 00:40:55.599]  I agree.
[00:40:56.588 --> 00:41:05.771]  Of course, as you said, they're going to blame Trump for everything, but he's doing the right thing and telling the truth about what really is causing this global heating.
[00:41:05.911 --> 00:41:08.812]  And it's not totally being controlled by the Illuminists.
[00:41:09.353 --> 00:41:15.815]  Certainly, the technology does exist for steering huge hurricanes and tornadoes once they start.
[00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:25.204]  But it's not always easy for one power to start a hurricane because of the huge amount of energy we're talking about, like 100,000 H-bombs.
[00:41:25.284 --> 00:41:36.229]  It's so big that we don't have the power to direct it, but we can take something that starts and help it move into an area of warming in the sea that will then accelerate it.
[00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:43.733]  Exactly, they can put some English on it, like the sun rams the ball, the cue ball, but then we can kind of blow on it, maybe make it change course.
[00:41:44.551 --> 00:41:45.872]  Absolutely, yeah.
[00:41:46.453 --> 00:42:04.347]  So, you know, we've known for, gosh, several decades, probably four decades at least, that you can drop powdered dry ice from an aircraft above a hurricane on one side and cause it to rain and to drop a lot of its energy into the ocean and then kind of peter out and not be as big a threat.
[00:42:04.367 --> 00:42:07.089]  Well, that's what Ben Livingston, the father of weather weapons, has said.
[00:42:07.129 --> 00:42:10.312]  He said, with 15 aircraft, he can make it dump its water in the ocean.
[00:42:11.198 --> 00:42:11.418]  Right.
[00:42:11.839 --> 00:42:12.919]  I mean, why don't we do this?
[00:42:12.959 --> 00:42:14.401]  I mean, why didn't we do it now?
[00:42:15.361 --> 00:42:16.142]  So why do you think?
[00:42:16.182 --> 00:42:18.924]  Because it's the 1978 treaty or what?
[00:42:20.365 --> 00:42:26.170]  I wonder if it's a conflict with President Trump's administration by the, you know, the invisible government.
[00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:29.572]  I wonder if they could have done it, but they're doing it to put pressure on him.
[00:42:29.592 --> 00:42:31.714]  I mean, this is two hurricanes back-to-back.
[00:42:31.734 --> 00:42:32.935]  We're still cleaning up the other one.
[00:42:33.155 --> 00:42:33.855]  And two more!
[00:42:33.895 --> 00:42:34.616]  Two more are coming!
[00:42:35.837 --> 00:42:36.017]  Yep.
[00:42:36.377 --> 00:42:36.577]  Yep.
[00:42:36.678 --> 00:42:36.978]  Absolutely.
[00:42:38.462 --> 00:42:44.344]  But let's stay right there, because, well, it certainly backfired on them, because Harvey brought us together in the middle of that race war they were pushing.
[00:42:44.384 --> 00:42:50.046]  So, thank God Texans were so loving, including a lot of black folks saving white people, and vice versa, which is beautiful.
[00:42:50.406 --> 00:42:51.887]  Stan Dayo is an amazing researcher.
[00:42:51.907 --> 00:42:55.328]  Two more segments with him, then Dane Wigington.
[00:42:55.368 --> 00:42:56.228]  I keep saying Wigington.
[00:42:56.308 --> 00:42:57.208]  It's Wigington.
[00:42:57.529 --> 00:42:58.529]  Geoengineeringwatch.org.
[00:42:58.589 --> 00:43:00.790]  He's going to be joining us with big new findings.
[00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:01.270]  Stay with us.
[00:43:03.314 --> 00:43:05.695]  And we're not getting what humans always thought was key.
[00:43:05.915 --> 00:43:06.595]  The bone broth.
[00:43:07.315 --> 00:43:08.835]  The bone broth.
[00:43:09.055 --> 00:43:10.236]  The bone broth.
[00:43:10.456 --> 00:43:11.176]  The bone broth.
[00:43:11.516 --> 00:43:12.156]  The bone broth.
[00:43:12.916 --> 00:43:13.656]  The bone broth.
[00:43:14.196 --> 00:43:15.817]  Well, now it's the next level of that.
[00:43:15.897 --> 00:43:16.577]  It's caveman.
[00:43:17.277 --> 00:43:18.637]  Hey, I need a glass of caveman.
[00:43:18.998 --> 00:43:19.458]  Caveman.
[00:43:20.058 --> 00:43:20.318]  Mmm.
[00:43:20.738 --> 00:43:20.998]  Mmm.
[00:43:21.438 --> 00:43:22.078]  Mmm, man.
[00:43:22.138 --> 00:43:22.378]  Mmm.
[00:43:22.758 --> 00:43:23.759]  It's better than Ovaltine.
[00:43:23.919 --> 00:43:24.859]  Better than Ovaltine.
[00:43:24.939 --> 00:43:25.079]  Mmm.
[00:43:25.319 --> 00:43:26.480]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:43:26.921 --> 00:43:27.701]  It's unbelievable.
[00:43:28.422 --> 00:43:30.064]  Caveman is just over the top.
[00:43:30.564 --> 00:43:32.326]  What in the world?
[00:43:32.346 --> 00:43:35.228]  But now with the milk, I was like, whoa, this has milk in it.
[00:43:35.609 --> 00:43:37.290]  It tastes like good.
[00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:38.471]  Man, this tastes so good.
[00:43:39.693 --> 00:43:40.874]  Tastes like the best milkshake ever.
[00:43:41.975 --> 00:43:43.336]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:43:43.396 --> 00:43:44.717]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:43:44.777 --> 00:43:46.259]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:43:46.319 --> 00:43:47.080]  Like good.
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:48.941]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:43:49.001 --> 00:43:49.582]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:43:54.514 --> 00:44:01.201]  I can say without a doubt, at least in my experience, this is a super home run available at InfoWarsLive.com and it supports the broadcast.
[00:44:01.301 --> 00:44:02.863]  Alright, all the big news straight ahead.
[00:44:04.013 --> 00:44:08.916]  New from Emmerich's Essentials, fragrance-free natural deodorant for your body care needs.
[00:44:09.697 --> 00:44:12.639]  Playing basketball in the dry summer heat really makes me sweat.
[00:44:13.299 --> 00:44:16.101]  To maintain my game, I need all the confidence I can get.
[00:44:16.722 --> 00:44:21.605]  That's why I use Emmerich's Essentials natural deodorant, made with organic ingredients.
[00:44:21.965 --> 00:44:28.269]  This deodorant combines mineral crystals with natural botanicals to ionize odor, keeping me fresh throughout the day.
[00:44:28.629 --> 00:44:33.773]  While shooting hoops, the last thing I want is sweaty armpits making my hands slippery and the ball wet.
[00:44:34.453 --> 00:44:37.875]  That's why I recommend Emmerich's Essentials Fragrance-Free Deodorant.
[00:44:38.455 --> 00:44:46.278]  Even though it's unscented, it's effective at combating strong body odor, and I don't have to worry about any unwanted allergic reactions to my sensitive skin.
[00:44:46.858 --> 00:44:51.200]  Whether you're a guy or gal, the last thing you want to be worried about is your deodorant.
[00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:55.461]  No petroleum-based ingredients, 100% natural and cruelty-free.
[00:44:55.761 --> 00:44:59.583]  Stay in the game with Emmerich's Essentials Fragrance-Free Natural Deodorant.
[00:44:59.823 --> 00:45:01.764]  Available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:45:02.244 --> 00:45:06.630]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:17.664]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:45:17.824 --> 00:45:22.747]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:45:22.867 --> 00:45:25.369]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:45:25.429 --> 00:45:26.930]  It helps detoxify.
[00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:29.992]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:45:30.032 --> 00:45:34.795]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:45:34.815 --> 00:45:41.039]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:46.383]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:45:46.503 --> 00:45:47.824]  I'm taking it now, every day.
[00:45:47.824 --> 00:45:48.825]  Okay, this is so key.
[00:45:49.085 --> 00:45:53.388]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:45:53.428 --> 00:45:55.510]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:59.093]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:46:02.481 --> 00:46:06.002]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[00:46:06.463 --> 00:46:12.505]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[00:46:12.725 --> 00:46:15.706]  It is the new t-shirt from infowarsstore.com.
[00:46:16.086 --> 00:46:19.087]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:46:19.287 --> 00:46:22.729]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[00:46:23.069 --> 00:46:24.830]  The left controls culture.
[00:46:24.850 --> 00:46:25.830]  They control arts.
[00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:27.130]  They control entertainment.
[00:46:27.411 --> 00:46:30.872]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why
[00:46:31.272 --> 00:46:34.494]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:46:34.554 --> 00:46:36.955]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[00:46:37.435 --> 00:46:41.297]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[00:46:41.357 --> 00:46:46.719]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate the image of my face and that particular slogan.
[00:46:46.979 --> 00:46:49.441]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:46:49.681 --> 00:46:52.382]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter,
[00:46:52.782 --> 00:46:55.925]  It will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[00:46:56.005 --> 00:46:57.707]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[00:46:57.867 --> 00:46:59.048]  It's available right now.
[00:46:59.349 --> 00:47:01.911]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[00:47:06.896 --> 00:47:09.539]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:23.392]  You're listening to the Antidote for Fake News.
[00:47:23.932 --> 00:47:28.714]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:29.314 --> 00:47:33.276]  Speaking of fake news, since I mentioned it earlier, we might as well play it.
[00:47:33.396 --> 00:47:34.376]  Remember Alec Baldwin?
[00:47:34.577 --> 00:47:37.238]  When they have him playing the part of the president aliens have attacked?
[00:47:38.069 --> 00:47:45.071]  And he's playing the part of Trump and he goes, look at these people, they're black, they're not humans, they're aliens, they're illegal aliens.
[00:47:45.391 --> 00:47:47.491]  You can't see it on talk radio I'm describing.
[00:47:47.531 --> 00:47:49.372]  He's pointing at black people in the U.S.
[00:47:49.432 --> 00:47:53.113]  Army and saying Alex Jones told me black people are bad.
[00:47:53.133 --> 00:48:00.415]  I mean, this is what they're doing on seven comedy shows and other programs like
[00:48:02.443 --> 00:48:03.504]  Oh, what's the name of it?
[00:48:03.724 --> 00:48:04.284]  Uh, Homeland.
[00:48:04.945 --> 00:48:10.709]  Where the whole character running fake news and doing horrible things and staging terror attacks is me!
[00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:12.471]  And they say it's supposed to be me!
[00:48:13.732 --> 00:48:16.814]  And then now they got a whole new show on Comedy Central on top of all the others.
[00:48:16.854 --> 00:48:18.455]  And I'm not just bringing myself into this.
[00:48:18.816 --> 00:48:20.217]  They're scared of one thing.
[00:48:20.837 --> 00:48:21.578]  You, the listeners.
[00:48:22.558 --> 00:48:24.480]  They know I get people on like Stan Dayo.
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:25.641]  They know I get Ron Paul on.
[00:48:25.661 --> 00:48:27.082]  They know I get Nigel Farage on.
[00:48:27.362 --> 00:48:29.344]  They know I'm one of the only guys that can get Matt Grudge on.
[00:48:29.684 --> 00:48:31.986]  They know that thinkers are listening.
[00:48:33.015 --> 00:48:34.176]  They know Trump listens.
[00:48:34.236 --> 00:48:35.217]  They know Putin listens.
[00:48:35.237 --> 00:48:36.818]  And it's not that I'm even that smart.
[00:48:37.058 --> 00:48:45.225]  I just rang the alarm bell and built a platform to cover real stuff where they're saying that they've got earthquake weapons, Secretary of Defense William Cohen.
[00:48:45.245 --> 00:48:49.868]  I'm going to read this to you in a moment, but I'm just saying, remember, it's not about defending me.
[00:48:49.888 --> 00:48:50.849]  It's about defending you.
[00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:56.534]  They have chosen me to be the symbol of the resistance, along with Trump, and then try to destroy me.
[00:48:58.183 --> 00:48:59.646]  But not my actual body.
[00:49:00.007 --> 00:49:07.645]  Create a fake Alex Jones, say horrible racist stuff out of its mouth, but hide behind, oh, it's just comedy, and then I get attacked.
[00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:10.151]  And my family gets spit upon on the street.
[00:49:10.452 --> 00:49:14.615]  I get coffee dumped on my head by the drones.
[00:49:14.755 --> 00:49:18.979]  It's a minority of people of every race, color, and creed, but they've been brainwashed.
[00:49:19.359 --> 00:49:26.085]  So we're going to talk about the big earthquake that hit Mexico, Stan Deo's predictions and projections on that, because he's one of the top guys.
[00:49:26.125 --> 00:49:33.311]  But first, here's that clip just to show how six months ago they signaled this assault, and now it's here.
[00:49:33.511 --> 00:49:33.812]  Here it is.
[00:49:35.092 --> 00:49:37.374]  Sir, where are you getting this information?
[00:49:37.914 --> 00:49:39.635]  From a very reputable source.
[00:49:39.955 --> 00:49:40.215]  What?
[00:49:40.275 --> 00:49:41.036]  The FBI?
[00:49:41.076 --> 00:49:41.756]  The CIA?
[00:49:41.896 --> 00:49:42.877]  Info Wars.
[00:49:42.957 --> 00:49:44.998]  It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[00:49:45.058 --> 00:49:47.880]  Sir, where are you getting this information?
[00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:50.001]  From a very reputable source.
[00:49:50.021 --> 00:49:53.203]  Again, and right before that, he's pointing at black people saying they're not human.
[00:49:54.124 --> 00:49:55.385]  And he got that from Alex Jones.
[00:49:55.445 --> 00:49:57.246]  So, I'm very proud of this.
[00:49:57.386 --> 00:49:58.206]  I wanted to fight him.
[00:49:58.307 --> 00:49:59.367]  I wanted to raise the alarm.
[00:49:59.447 --> 00:50:00.308]  I wanted to change things.
[00:50:00.748 --> 00:50:01.689]  I never thought
[00:50:02.768 --> 00:50:06.810]  I'd be singled out as, you know, there's Trump here, and then there's me right here.
[00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:08.211]  And then it's everybody else below that.
[00:50:08.591 --> 00:50:10.012]  I don't want to be the big kahuna.
[00:50:10.832 --> 00:50:10.932]  Okay?
[00:50:10.952 --> 00:50:13.494]  They're trying to destroy Stephen Bannon, too, because they see him right up there.
[00:50:13.514 --> 00:50:14.334]  And Matt Drudge.
[00:50:15.195 --> 00:50:18.176]  The point is, what is it, Stan Zayo, they're so scared of?
[00:50:18.296 --> 00:50:19.377]  Why have they chosen me?
[00:50:19.877 --> 00:50:20.678]  Because you're a smart guy.
[00:50:20.698 --> 00:50:23.139]  I don't want to talk about myself here, but it's really getting crazy.
[00:50:25.367 --> 00:50:26.628]  Why did they pick on you?
[00:50:26.668 --> 00:50:28.710]  It's probably because you're telling the truth.
[00:50:29.131 --> 00:50:31.313]  I've been amazed by what you've been able to get away with.
[00:50:31.553 --> 00:50:39.681]  We've talked about it behind the scenes and on the phone and stuff, but to be able to get it out there and to have the President of the United States listen is a marvelous thing.
[00:50:39.701 --> 00:50:46.688]  I tell you, I'm so glad that he's there, but I'm also sad that he's being picked on with so many things at once.
[00:50:46.728 --> 00:50:47.109]  It must be
[00:50:48.047 --> 00:50:54.313]  You know, driving him crazy up there, trying to handle all these emergencies politically, geophysically, you know, astronomically.
[00:50:55.354 --> 00:50:56.455]  What a challenge.
[00:50:57.056 --> 00:50:57.717]  I hope he makes it.
[00:50:58.117 --> 00:50:58.697]  It is crazy.
[00:50:58.738 --> 00:51:00.579]  I think that's the secret.
[00:51:00.599 --> 00:51:01.540]  It wasn't what I did.
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:02.561]  It's all the guests here.
[00:51:02.621 --> 00:51:07.146]  And it's our audience getting the news out and going to the Trump rallies and getting him all the stuff.
[00:51:07.166 --> 00:51:09.007]  Because he'd heard the show before and he'd been on years ago.
[00:51:10.108 --> 00:51:15.050]  It's true that when he sneaks off, he looks at Infowars, he looks at Breitbart, he looks at Drudge.
[00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:22.433]  I mean, he didn't even know Arpaio was being sent to prison until he learned about it on Drudge from one of our articles, and then now they're flipping out about that.
[00:51:22.473 --> 00:51:26.434]  It just shows when you can get the info to him, it really has an effect.
[00:51:27.334 --> 00:51:33.336]  That's the trick, is to be able to get through the wall built around him, you know, because it's all filtered.
[00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:41.218]  If you can't get to him, then you go to social media and hopefully he'll pick it up with the tweets and stuff that come from that.
[00:51:41.378 --> 00:51:52.072]  And that's why everybody's got a hammer at Trump, because they try to block all his supportive tweets below, but he now knows, because somebody told him on the phone, to dig down deep into there and...
[00:51:53.354 --> 00:51:54.294]  That's what's happening as well.
[00:51:54.314 --> 00:51:57.155]  Because I talked to the fellow that did talk to Trump months ago and explained.
[00:51:57.175 --> 00:52:01.017]  He goes, yeah, why I don't ever see all the popular and fun stuff and the funny things.
[00:52:01.077 --> 00:52:02.798]  And he loved reading all the stuff.
[00:52:02.818 --> 00:52:04.278]  He used to love the mail coming too.
[00:52:04.518 --> 00:52:05.398]  You still get to him that way.
[00:52:05.979 --> 00:52:06.819]  They're trying to divert that.
[00:52:06.839 --> 00:52:07.879]  But I don't want to go off into Trump.
[00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:11.101]  It's just amazing to see how they try to compartmentalize us.
[00:52:11.441 --> 00:52:12.961]  And now they're compartmentalizing the president.
[00:52:13.281 --> 00:52:15.022]  And they bragged when he first got elected.
[00:52:15.042 --> 00:52:17.023]  They said, we're going to feed him false intelligence.
[00:52:17.263 --> 00:52:18.623]  We're going to totally sequester him.
[00:52:18.843 --> 00:52:19.624]  We're going to surround him.
[00:52:19.644 --> 00:52:20.084]  And they've done it.
[00:52:21.192 --> 00:52:22.332]  They have, they have.
[00:52:22.572 --> 00:52:27.293]  But anyway, we need to encourage him any way we can in the public media, social media.
[00:52:28.073 --> 00:52:33.334]  I hope he gets to hear that so he's encouraged and not just totally depressed by all the people making warnings.
[00:52:33.355 --> 00:52:33.695]  Absolutely.
[00:52:33.715 --> 00:52:34.455]  93 plus dead.
[00:52:34.475 --> 00:52:36.095]  It is growing in Mexico.
[00:52:36.115 --> 00:52:37.815]  I don't want to belittle new numbers coming out.
[00:52:37.835 --> 00:52:38.796]  I think it's even higher than that.
[00:52:39.316 --> 00:52:41.176]  One of the biggest, well the biggest quake ever recorded, 8.1, 8.3.
[00:52:42.836 --> 00:52:43.937]  They're changing the numbers.
[00:52:44.257 --> 00:52:45.157]  What happened there, Stan?
[00:52:46.348 --> 00:52:47.749]  Hey, I was watching that one.
[00:52:47.769 --> 00:52:49.689]  Just a kind of a comical note here.
[00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:53.951]  That's right near Oaxaca, where they grow all the agave plants to make my tequila.
[00:52:53.971 --> 00:52:54.952]  And I was really worried.
[00:52:57.473 --> 00:52:57.673]  Yeah.
[00:52:58.013 --> 00:52:58.253]  OK.
[00:52:58.593 --> 00:53:04.456]  Now, seriously, though, that is on a fault line called the Imperial fault line going up into Southern California.
[00:53:05.097 --> 00:53:06.818]  And that goes into the Salton Sea area.
[00:53:06.858 --> 00:53:11.681]  We think it's going to connect up shortly under a little lake there with the San Andreas Fault.
[00:53:12.201 --> 00:53:13.802]  But the San Andreas Fault is not an orphan.
[00:53:13.822 --> 00:53:15.343]  There are a lot of parallel faults to it.
[00:53:15.724 --> 00:53:27.971]  And I'm looking now every day at minor quakes, you know, not major, minors along the lower San Andreas, right where, just beneath Los Angeles at Costa Mesa.
[00:53:28.998 --> 00:53:35.441]  If we start seeing more of these little earthquakes pop, then I'm thinking we may see a Richter 6 to 7 down there, just like USGS is forecasting.
[00:53:36.101 --> 00:53:49.227]  They said the probability is about 50 to 70 percent in the next 30 years sometime that we'll have that 6.5, 6.7 earthquake there, which may trigger other earthquakes parallel to it in the Costa Mesa region.
[00:53:49.747 --> 00:53:55.190]  But seeing all these, the flurry of them, the swarm of them up in Idaho at Soda Springs,
[00:53:55.899 --> 00:53:56.320]  He's really
[00:54:15.083 --> 00:54:17.584]  And we know that Yellowstone is being monitored by the government.
[00:54:17.904 --> 00:54:20.625]  I've personally talked to the geologists there.
[00:54:21.465 --> 00:54:26.467]  And, you know, they can't go on record because they're all soaring the secrets inside the little paper during Obama's reign.
[00:54:27.047 --> 00:54:36.730]  But there are a number of supersensitive seismometers they've put in around Yellowstone and are monitoring them constantly down in Utah at the new computer center.
[00:54:37.350 --> 00:54:39.331]  To keep an eye on the magma beneath.
[00:54:40.311 --> 00:54:48.753]  You've read, I'm sure, in the last week to ten days, where NASA suggested they go down and pump water down there to cool off the magma as a possible way to defuse it.
[00:54:49.093 --> 00:54:53.855]  But of course, the logical arguments are, if you do that, you don't know what's going to happen.
[00:54:53.895 --> 00:54:58.856]  You may actually cause a supermassive steam phreatic type eruption from Yellowstone.
[00:54:59.682 --> 00:55:02.904]  Because you can't control the fractures around the hole you make to get the water down.
[00:55:03.704 --> 00:55:05.845]  You know, there's just a number of other issues.
[00:55:07.966 --> 00:55:09.687]  Why is it all increasing right now?
[00:55:09.707 --> 00:55:18.492]  And I know from your research I heard 10 years ago on Coast to Coast AM, it's now mainstream news that there are many years, how many years overdue for a big earthquake in Southern California?
[00:55:18.832 --> 00:55:21.453]  And then suddenly now even the LA Times says get ready.
[00:55:21.773 --> 00:55:22.894]  So what's happening there?
[00:55:24.167 --> 00:55:35.354]  Well, I think, you know, if I were in charge of the government and had this information and I knew it was going to happen, say, within five years or a year, whatever, I wouldn't just come out and blurt it out in the mainstream and say, OK, it's going to happen.
[00:55:35.614 --> 00:55:35.974]  Good luck.
[00:55:36.214 --> 00:55:36.995]  We can't handle you.
[00:55:37.035 --> 00:55:38.596]  We've got too many other emergencies right now.
[00:55:38.656 --> 00:55:40.017]  But, you know, get prepared.
[00:55:40.677 --> 00:55:42.278]  It would cause, you know, anarchy.
[00:55:43.775 --> 00:55:46.016]  And, you know, so I wouldn't do that.
[00:55:46.156 --> 00:56:01.042]  I would let the information sift out as, well, in the next 30 years it looks like it's going to be an earthquake of such and such in California, and people might be well advised to get preparations made to keep a lid on the panic and the anarchy that could result.
[00:56:01.322 --> 00:56:05.104]  I mean, look at what's happened down in Florida over a hurricane that hadn't even hit yet.
[00:56:05.604 --> 00:56:07.945]  And they said, OK, we want you to evacuate the state.
[00:56:08.345 --> 00:56:12.966]  Well, immediately, Holley was plotting all the gas stations that were out of gas immediately.
[00:56:13.046 --> 00:56:13.366]  Oh, yeah.
[00:56:13.406 --> 00:56:15.787]  I mean, people couldn't evacuate because the highways were clogged.
[00:56:15.807 --> 00:56:16.607]  The gas was out.
[00:56:16.987 --> 00:56:20.628]  It shows that with these big mega cities, there is no tenable plan.
[00:56:20.929 --> 00:56:25.590]  So what does that mean when a what happens when a big quake hits something like Southern California?
[00:56:26.311 --> 00:56:28.233]  Well, people should get prepared now.
[00:56:28.313 --> 00:56:32.037]  They should have been prepared even before this with emergency rations, water, and whatever.
[00:56:33.378 --> 00:56:37.863]  Whether it's the earthquake or some local event, like today out in front of our house, a water main burst.
[00:56:38.323 --> 00:56:42.027]  And we didn't have water here, but of course we had emergency water prep in our home.
[00:56:42.087 --> 00:56:43.509]  Holly had that written about in the book.
[00:56:44.089 --> 00:56:46.971]  And we were quite comfortable and weren't inconvenienced.
[00:56:47.011 --> 00:56:50.434]  But if we hadn't have done that, we'd have been kind of hanging out there waiting for them to get the water back.
[00:56:50.574 --> 00:56:52.815]  But imagine cascading events like this.
[00:56:53.375 --> 00:56:55.537]  As we're seeing, many countries now can't keep up.
[00:56:55.597 --> 00:56:58.859]  Even former industrialized nations are starting to crumble and have problems.
[00:56:59.219 --> 00:56:59.780]  What's happening?
[00:57:01.519 --> 00:57:08.165]  There are a number of issues, and I think the change in the weather, climate, whether it's man-made or the sun, I think it's the sun primarily.
[00:57:08.685 --> 00:57:22.638]  This is hitting our food supplies, which hits the economy, and it's also radiating us when we have these CMEs with different types of radiation, and it makes people irritable, crankier, and we can see it when we go to the grocery store occasionally.
[00:57:22.918 --> 00:57:23.959]  So I just asked a question.
[00:57:23.999 --> 00:57:28.842]  The Romans, the Japanese all noticed that during these times, people would get more irritable.
[00:57:28.882 --> 00:57:31.805]  They didn't know why when storms were associated with it.
[00:57:32.525 --> 00:57:34.467]  Let's talk about that animal psychology.
[00:57:34.967 --> 00:57:39.430]  Straight ahead, ladies and gentlemen, with Stan Dao, standao.com.
[00:57:39.811 --> 00:57:43.533]  And then we've got one of the top researchers coming on about geoengineering.
[00:57:44.474 --> 00:57:46.155]  Did they manipulate this hurricane?
[00:57:46.195 --> 00:57:50.478]  And if they have technologies that could have killed it, why aren't they doing that, as Stan Dao asked?
[00:57:50.699 --> 00:57:51.860]  Please tell folks to tune in.
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:52.200]  It's key.
[00:57:53.653 --> 00:57:53.773]  U.S.
[00:57:53.813 --> 00:57:59.357]  President Donald Trump on Tuesday giving North Korea his most aggressive warning to date.
[00:57:59.437 --> 00:58:00.859]  President Trump is not a racist.
[00:58:01.119 --> 00:58:04.261]  I say red baseball caps mean you're an asshole.
[00:58:04.461 --> 00:58:08.985]  Tonight, the fight over confederate statues is now a flashpoint.
[00:58:09.005 --> 00:58:13.228]  Large groups of people punching, kicking, and hitting each other with sticks.
[00:58:13.488 --> 00:58:18.412]  If you see this and you understand what is going on and it makes you angry, do not take yourself out of the game.
[00:58:22.675 --> 00:58:24.056]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:58:24.336 --> 00:58:25.617]  You can't survive without it.
[00:58:25.817 --> 00:58:26.718]  But where do you get it?

[00:59:55.996 --> 01:00:01.958]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:10.220]  Seems like time's speeding up.
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:12.481]  We know technology is
[01:00:15.143 --> 01:00:16.605]  This is our land.
[01:00:17.246 --> 01:00:18.006]  These are our people.
[01:00:18.026 --> 01:00:18.247]  The workers.
[01:00:18.267 --> 01:00:18.567]  The strikers.
[01:00:18.587 --> 01:00:18.947]  The builders.
[01:00:19.768 --> 01:00:21.170]  These are our people.
[01:00:34.961 --> 01:00:36.623]  And that's why we've got a big board in there now.
[01:00:36.703 --> 01:00:39.866]  We write all these great guest names on, so we think about them.
[01:00:39.946 --> 01:00:42.669]  I want to get this guy on every week, not every year.
[01:00:42.689 --> 01:00:47.553]  We'll be back after this intro to let him have some final comments.
[01:00:49.695 --> 01:00:49.836]  It's 1776.
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:57.543]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:59.325 --> 01:01:00.706]  I've met so many amazing people.
[01:01:00.726 --> 01:01:02.207]  You can pull his name up.
[01:01:02.227 --> 01:01:03.749]  He was a famous British economist.
[01:01:03.769 --> 01:01:06.131]  I mean, top of the government back in the 80s and stuff.
[01:01:06.491 --> 01:01:08.693]  And I ran into him covering Bilderberg in Canada.
[01:01:08.713 --> 01:01:10.715]  Didn't even know how famous he was.
[01:01:10.735 --> 01:01:12.297]  And he just said, the answer to 1984, Alex, is 1776.
[01:01:12.337 --> 01:01:13.098]  And he was a mathematician.
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:20.564]  Anybody said that's a social term, like 1776 will override 1984, the tyranny.
[01:01:21.025 --> 01:01:25.569]  Stan, please come back this week with us and then try to come on at least once a week, once a month.
[01:01:25.609 --> 01:01:26.870]  I'm watching all these new shows.
[01:01:27.210 --> 01:01:35.097]  I'd love to get you on a couple days a week just to calm and take cover, whatever you want, long form, without me interrupting, which, you know, because you're such a nice guy.
[01:01:35.137 --> 01:01:36.378]  We only got like four minutes left.
[01:01:37.058 --> 01:01:42.323]  Your points, things you want to add, things that are going on, things that are happening, things you want to impart to people.
[01:01:43.502 --> 01:01:51.429]  Well, the main thing in relation to the weather is hurricanes have, they're a low-pressure area, and when they move over land, they start to slow down.
[01:01:51.529 --> 01:02:04.520]  But if they move over a known fault line that is already stressed and ready to release, it has been documented that the earthquake will occur as the low-pressure area causes a heave in the surface and you have the earthquake.
[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:11.686]  This one is going to peter out over Tennessee, near the New Madrid
[01:02:13.363 --> 01:02:21.050]  I don't see a fault line listed there by USGS, but I'm watching that area for lubrication from the rain and from the lifting of the surface.
[01:02:21.090 --> 01:02:24.373]  What about that hurricane that was right over where the Mexican quake happened?
[01:02:25.174 --> 01:02:25.835]  Interesting, wasn't it?
[01:02:27.336 --> 01:02:48.144]  I think, I think that the two... Actually, if you look at the same thing you're looking at there, that null wind map, and you plug in the thermal temperature, you know, the sea temperatures over the globe and the wind, you'll see that from Mexico, where that earthquake occurred, and where the hurricane occurred, all the way up to Florida, is bright purple, which is extreme heat.
[01:02:49.005 --> 01:02:54.667]  And the same kind of pattern exists on the west side of the Pacific over in Japan, where they've just now had another earthquake.
[01:02:56.568 --> 01:02:56.828]  See that?
[01:02:57.619 --> 01:02:58.140]  I know I do.
[01:02:58.180 --> 01:02:58.782]  It's incredible.
[01:02:58.802 --> 01:02:59.824]  So it's all interconnected?
[01:03:00.625 --> 01:03:00.826]  Yes.
[01:03:02.109 --> 01:03:02.810]  Wow.
[01:03:02.830 --> 01:03:05.957]  Just politically, what would you call the state the world's in right now?
[01:03:09.016 --> 01:03:27.542]  Politically and biblically, I'd say we're approaching the tribulation period that the prophets speak of in the Bible because of the threat to our economy, the global collapse economy, geophysical events in the weather, earthquakes, threatened asteroid impact.
[01:03:27.602 --> 01:03:38.506]  And by the way, on the 12th of October this year, you can see it on my show images page, I've got a plot there telling you about an asteroid that's going to come within the orbits of
[01:03:39.637 --> 01:03:43.684]  250 of our geosynchronous satellites that control GPS and communications.
[01:03:43.724 --> 01:03:48.212]  And by the way, Drudge Report tweeted that from NASA and Twitter blocked it.
[01:03:49.233 --> 01:03:50.035]  You're joking.
[01:03:50.495 --> 01:03:50.936]  No, no.
[01:03:51.417 --> 01:03:52.940]  Promise me you'll come back for an hour this week.
[01:03:53.809 --> 01:03:54.049]  Okay.
[01:03:54.449 --> 01:03:54.890]  Done deal.
[01:03:54.930 --> 01:03:55.550]  Just tell me when.
[01:03:55.690 --> 01:03:56.950]  Well, I want you to get into all this.
[01:03:57.431 --> 01:03:59.271]  I'm not going to ask the questions because you're so smart.
[01:03:59.311 --> 01:03:59.772]  I'm serious.
[01:04:00.732 --> 01:04:03.713]  You're nice and sit back like the good, you know, good guy and let me ask questions.
[01:04:03.973 --> 01:04:13.137]  I want you to go wherever Stan Dale wants to on the asteroids, the Earth changes, but I mean, regardless, if the Bible isn't true, the globalists are sure using it as a handbook to take over.
[01:04:13.398 --> 01:04:17.780]  The Mark of the Beast, the persecution of Christians, kicking them off Amazon, kicking them off Google.
[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:21.961]  I mean, it's mainline focus on the family and stuff getting attacked.
[01:04:22.021 --> 01:04:23.242]  I mean, they're really coming after people.
[01:04:23.908 --> 01:04:25.469]  Can you believe we're actually seeing this?
[01:04:25.609 --> 01:04:31.914]  I mean, it just came on so suddenly that, you know, even though we expect it from biblical prophecy, I mean, I'm astounded.
[01:04:32.394 --> 01:04:33.154]  They're just hating us.
[01:04:33.795 --> 01:04:38.598]  Well, Trump sped it up, and I want to ask you this week when you come on, who is Trump in biblical prophecy?
[01:04:40.159 --> 01:04:40.800]  Good question.
[01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:41.640]  We'll think about that.
[01:04:42.101 --> 01:04:43.342]  All right, Standale.com.
[01:04:43.362 --> 01:04:44.142]  Standale, thank you.
[01:04:44.863 --> 01:04:45.063]  Wow.
[01:04:46.463 --> 01:04:47.284]  Why is that guy?
[01:04:47.664 --> 01:04:49.707]  I just think, like, these guests are so good.
[01:04:49.727 --> 01:04:51.949]  And then, like, a year goes by since he's been on.
[01:04:52.329 --> 01:04:53.911]  You're gonna start hearing more of him, I promise.
[01:04:53.971 --> 01:04:55.653]  That's why we're going 20 hours live.
[01:04:55.893 --> 01:04:58.816]  We're up to 10 hours live in the last two months, like I promised.
[01:04:58.836 --> 01:05:01.699]  We're going up to 20 hours live in the next six months.
[01:05:01.719 --> 01:05:02.180]  Stay with us.
[01:05:08.462 --> 01:05:15.087]  We've got great air filters, great water filters, great non-GMO heirloom seeds, great books, great films, great Patriot apparel to meet like-minded people.
[01:05:15.307 --> 01:05:17.689]  And we've got a new humongoid sale.
[01:05:17.849 --> 01:05:21.151]  Not the number of things that are on massive sale, but on what's on sale.
[01:05:21.311 --> 01:05:23.453]  Out for months, not been on sale for months and months.
[01:05:23.513 --> 01:05:28.156]  We've never offered Super Mel Vitality known concentrated herbs, cold-pressed.
[01:05:28.336 --> 01:05:31.098]  Super Mel Vitality, 57% off.
[01:05:31.218 --> 01:05:35.421]  It's never been the price it is right now with 3,596 reviews, 4.6 reviews total by third-party sites.
[01:05:38.323 --> 01:05:39.143]  Unprecedented.
[01:05:39.223 --> 01:05:40.304]  And it's cold-pressed.
[01:05:40.444 --> 01:05:42.365]  That's why Supermail is so different.
[01:05:42.385 --> 01:05:48.667]  People say, well, I know these compounds work because it's admitted to science and these are other... What you sell, BuzzFeed said, is already best-selling stuff.
[01:05:48.727 --> 01:05:50.748]  It's been certified as healthy and good forever.
[01:05:50.788 --> 01:05:51.968]  Why, these aren't anything new.
[01:05:51.988 --> 01:05:56.050]  Because why do something new when you can have the oldest and best, but cold-pressed?
[01:05:56.070 --> 01:05:56.890]  Dude.
[01:05:56.910 --> 01:05:57.650]  Dude.
[01:06:09.813 --> 01:06:15.366]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:06:15.867 --> 01:06:18.393]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:06:43.669 --> 01:06:45.850]  We normally do the Sunday show 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:06:46.210 --> 01:06:48.152]  Weekdays my broadcast 11 a.m.
[01:06:48.172 --> 01:06:48.752]  to 3 p.m.
[01:06:49.052 --> 01:06:53.635]  Central, but just the last month we've gone 10 hours a day live with...
[01:06:55.249 --> 01:06:57.030]  The great David Knight, 8 a.m.
[01:06:57.050 --> 01:06:57.591]  to 11 a.m.
[01:06:57.611 --> 01:06:59.572]  before I come on weekdays with InfoWars Live.
[01:06:59.992 --> 01:07:01.153]  Here's truly Alex Jones.
[01:07:01.553 --> 01:07:04.956]  Then after that, Owen Schroer for three hours with The War Room.
[01:07:04.996 --> 01:07:06.437]  It's a big roundtable discussion.
[01:07:06.817 --> 01:07:10.980]  And I intend to go 20 hours a day live by the middle of next year.
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:15.803]  We may even do it sooner, but we're lining up all the talent, all the people, because InfoWars has got to do more.
[01:07:15.843 --> 01:07:17.524]  We're really affecting things.
[01:07:17.984 --> 01:07:19.125]  Global leaders are listening.
[01:07:19.185 --> 01:07:20.326]  Big corporations are listening.
[01:07:20.646 --> 01:07:22.607]  We're decompartmentalizing things.
[01:07:23.228 --> 01:07:24.829]  You had, of course, the big
[01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:27.190]  Manhattan Project.
[01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:30.431]  Back in the early 1940s, they kept it secret.
[01:07:30.751 --> 01:07:33.131]  Hundreds of thousands of people directly involved.
[01:07:33.851 --> 01:07:35.572]  Two million involved supporting it.
[01:07:36.132 --> 01:07:40.133]  And they kept the whole thing secret until they dropped A-bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
[01:07:40.673 --> 01:07:45.135]  Well, weather modification globally has been kept secret the same way.
[01:07:45.815 --> 01:07:53.317]  And there's other programs of human-animal hybrids, genetic engineering, pharmacological crops, that's actually in the MIT literature.
[01:07:54.434 --> 01:07:55.574]  But not given attention.
[01:07:56.195 --> 01:08:18.163]  Now, our next guest, who I've interviewed many, many years ago, probably 50 times, Dane Wigington, is an amazing researcher, geoengineering, watch.org, an engineer, I'm not going to get into all the big things he's been involved in, but when he learned about this over a decade ago, he dedicated himself, despite the fact he was running big solar farms around the country and a very successful guy,
[01:08:18.843 --> 01:08:26.565]  Because he realized it was so big and now he's gotten closer to the bottom of the rabbit hole than probably anybody out there.
[01:08:26.585 --> 01:08:37.549]  But more and more they admit, oh the military is doing chemical cleanup and mosquito spraying and helping with the storms, cloud seeding and oh there's some drills going on and we have the
[01:08:38.789 --> 01:08:43.371]  Secretary of Defense William Cohen back in 1997 in a press briefing.
[01:08:43.731 --> 01:08:44.792]  Back then it was only text.
[01:08:44.852 --> 01:08:45.412]  The Pentagon.
[01:08:45.432 --> 01:08:47.593]  Here it is on screen for radio listeners.
[01:08:47.633 --> 01:08:48.334]  You just go to U.S.
[01:08:48.354 --> 01:08:52.976]  Department of Defense, type in DOD News Briefing, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen.
[01:08:53.676 --> 01:08:55.657]  Presenter, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen.
[01:08:56.298 --> 01:08:57.698]  April 28, 1997.
[01:08:58.839 --> 01:09:05.582]  Here's the CIA breakdown as well, admitting last year weather modification programs.
[01:09:05.602 --> 01:09:06.703]  There's the Atlantic Monthly.
[01:09:07.423 --> 01:09:17.251]  There's the Central Intelligence Agency admitting they're expanding their covert weather control, Council on Foreign Relations, developing an international framework for geoengineering.
[01:09:17.271 --> 01:09:21.914]  But we have the 1978 treaty that began in 1972 in negotiations with Russia.
[01:09:22.375 --> 01:09:28.980]  So, we're talking about something real, but they want to keep it academic while they do it, calling all that testing.
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:34.104]  They don't want to have a real debate, a real discussion about what they're really doing.
[01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:42.582]  The incredible scientists, researchers at geoengineeringwatch.org, which is the number one compendium of research.
[01:09:42.602 --> 01:09:43.822]  You could get lost there.
[01:09:43.842 --> 01:09:48.264]  I tried to make a film called Dark Skies, before they ever had a movie called that, and I just fell down a rabbit hole.
[01:09:48.284 --> 01:09:53.926]  It was all so admitted, but all academic, that I couldn't even believe how to respond.
[01:09:53.966 --> 01:09:58.047]  And I realized what Dane was saying, Wigington is right.
[01:09:59.218 --> 01:10:02.520]  That don't use the term chemtrail that just came out of the public noticing it.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:10.404]  Go to the Nobel Prizes, go to the admissions, go to the geoengineering, go to the high-altitude aerosol spraying, go to these admitted programs.
[01:10:10.464 --> 01:10:13.446]  So we've got him for this segment, the next to condense this down.
[01:10:13.826 --> 01:10:15.147]  I really appreciate him coming on.
[01:10:15.187 --> 01:10:15.867]  Let's go over it.
[01:10:18.148 --> 01:10:18.668]  Good to have you.
[01:10:18.829 --> 01:10:19.689]  Good to be back, Alex.
[01:10:19.749 --> 01:10:27.033]  And you know, as you correctly stated in our portion this morning, that the climate engineering particulates are trapping more heat than they deflect.
[01:10:27.617 --> 01:10:30.418]  And our goal at GeoengineeringWatch.org is to present solid data.
[01:10:30.478 --> 01:10:44.364]  And Alex, I hope that we can unite the tribes, if you will, in regard to certain common mantras that there can't be, again, as I stated earlier in the first segment this morning, can't be any legitimate discussion about the state of the climate without including the climate engineering issue.
[01:10:44.384 --> 01:10:49.146]  So we have the entire environmentalist community, the climate science community, omitting
[01:10:49.850 --> 01:10:54.014]  The single greatest disrupting factor of all, not the only disrupting factor, but the single greatest.
[01:10:54.034 --> 01:11:05.804]  So if we could unite the tribes, if you will, in the common mantra that none of us on any side of the fence, no one can have a legitimate discussion about the state of the climate without first and foremost, including climate engineering.
[01:11:07.586 --> 01:11:13.711]  Absolutely, because Russia and China and Dubai, they all admit they've got antenna arrays doing it.
[01:11:13.851 --> 01:11:18.535]  I mean, they've got chemical systems spraying, and it's all public in their countries.
[01:11:18.856 --> 01:11:22.138]  Here they just say it's not going on, but it turns out we pioneered it all.
[01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:24.921]  That's exactly right.
[01:11:24.941 --> 01:11:26.182]  And if people want to see just how
[01:11:27.102 --> 01:11:28.222]  documented this is.
[01:11:28.422 --> 01:11:32.583]  We have a report, a Senate report on geoengineeringwatch.org.
[01:11:32.623 --> 01:11:34.784]  It's a 750-page congressional document from 1978.
[01:11:34.864 --> 01:11:39.745]  You can look at the document in its entirety if you search massive senate document geoengineering.
[01:11:40.405 --> 01:11:52.287]  And on that document it states clearly that normally opposing or adversarial governments will cooperate on the climate engineering issue because of the cross-border ramifications.
[01:11:52.327 --> 01:11:56.148]  So there you have conclusive proof that all the major powers, whatever their
[01:11:57.012 --> 01:11:59.973]  External conflicts appear to be that's publicized.
[01:12:00.233 --> 01:12:05.795]  They are absolutely colluding and cooperating on the climate engineering issue because obviously it affects the entire climate system.
[01:12:05.835 --> 01:12:09.976]  So we have quite a global cabal.
[01:12:10.016 --> 01:12:18.799]  And that's what's amazing in the congressional report that then becomes the UN treaty, is that they admit, hey, we all want to do this, so we all agree we're going to work with each other on it.
[01:12:20.014 --> 01:12:20.454]  Exactly.
[01:12:20.495 --> 01:12:24.599]  They all have their own agendas and objectives with these programs, but they're absolutely all colluding.
[01:12:24.679 --> 01:12:25.980]  So how advanced is it?
[01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:32.166]  I mean, I know you go to the geoengineering summits, you know, where they are there, you know, a lot of it's classified.
[01:12:32.247 --> 01:12:33.368]  I mean, how far along is it?
[01:12:34.589 --> 01:12:40.395]  The last international conference I went to and confronted the most recognized geoengineer on the planet, David Keith.
[01:12:41.013 --> 01:12:42.495]  And your listeners can look at this conversation.
[01:12:42.515 --> 01:12:43.837]  I think they would find it quite valuable.
[01:12:43.877 --> 01:12:45.439]  They search Dane Wiggins and David Keith.
[01:12:45.459 --> 01:12:49.965]  They'll see me confronting David Keith after listening to a three and a half hour symposium of him
[01:12:51.465 --> 01:12:57.551]  Proposing the annual objective of dumping 20 million tons of aluminum nanoparticulates into the atmosphere.
[01:12:57.571 --> 01:13:11.003]  My question to Dr. Keith was, had any studies been done whatsoever, the toxicological effects, human health effects, and after him trying to dodge the question by stating that there's a lot of aerosols in the atmosphere already, if a bit more won't make a difference.
[01:13:11.787 --> 01:13:26.327]  I reconfronted him that those aerosols aren't aluminum had he studied aluminum and he stated on the record that they had done no studies of human toxicological effects and he said quote I'm quoting said could terrible things happen tomorrow we don't know what kind of a statement is that from a quote-unquote scientist that I was banned
[01:13:26.707 --> 01:13:28.809]  From the subsequent conferences after that.
[01:13:28.829 --> 01:13:30.951]  For Alex... Let's be clear, I hadn't seen that video in years.
[01:13:31.011 --> 01:13:32.572]  I'm glad you reminded me of that.
[01:13:32.612 --> 01:13:33.273]  I'm on your side.
[01:13:33.313 --> 01:13:34.133]  I see the text of it.
[01:13:34.514 --> 01:13:36.656]  Well, how do we search YouTube or whatever to find that video?
[01:13:36.676 --> 01:13:45.903]  I want to play that clip when we come back, because that's so powerful that then, because you actually went, hey, aluminum causes brain damage, and he just, he couldn't, he said, oh, there's already lots of toxic waste.
[01:13:46.004 --> 01:13:49.447]  It's like saying, you know, five guys already raped your wife, so how about a hundred?
[01:13:49.507 --> 01:13:51.949]  Or, you know, we already shot you once, how about three more bullets?
[01:13:52.952 --> 01:13:55.553]  Yeah, that's the right line of thought for him.
[01:13:55.573 --> 01:14:00.496]  If you search Dane Wheatonton, David Keith, Geoengineering Watch, you'll find that short clip.
[01:14:00.836 --> 01:14:01.396]  No question.
[01:14:02.877 --> 01:14:05.258]  So continue, because people pay attention during a hurricane.
[01:14:05.558 --> 01:14:09.320]  They want to make it about carbon taxes, pay world government, you know, to fix this.
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:12.121]  It's not going to fix it to shut down our plants and move them to Mexico.
[01:14:12.421 --> 01:14:13.622]  I know we're affecting the climate.
[01:14:13.822 --> 01:14:20.545]  The point is there's a bunch of secret programs, so how do I make real decisions for my family when I don't know, when it's all hidden under a national security state?
[01:14:21.493 --> 01:14:29.997]  Well, first again, if we can unite the tribes on every side of the fence with this common understanding that you can't discuss the climate without discussing climate engineering.
[01:14:30.037 --> 01:14:33.959]  So again, whatever person's point of view, that has to be the front line of the conversation.
[01:14:33.979 --> 01:14:40.182]  So let's look at Irma that just came from so far away, and they knew the trajectory seven days ahead of time.
[01:14:40.222 --> 01:14:40.782]  How did they know?
[01:14:40.862 --> 01:14:42.063]  And interesting that Cuba got
[01:14:42.603 --> 01:14:43.364]  We're good to go.
[01:15:05.058 --> 01:15:14.406]  You have several dozen large ground-based facilities like HAARP around the globe, and they can create and do create high-pressure domes, just like the ridiculously resilient ridge that's frying the U.S.
[01:15:14.446 --> 01:15:15.326]  West right now, Alex.
[01:15:15.346 --> 01:15:23.413]  That's what happened over the Gulf of Mexico that forced Irma to make a right-hand turn and move up along the western side of Florida.
[01:15:24.133 --> 01:15:32.940]  On the ground, you have transmitters, and we'll publish an article on this probably tomorrow, a video that shows the transmissions of the ground-based transmitters that then take over and can help to steer the hurricane from the ground.
[01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:33.861]  So the bottom line is this.
[01:15:34.571 --> 01:15:38.534]  Historical data proves we have 70 years, 70 years of climate intervention.
[01:15:39.294 --> 01:15:40.795]  We know what's going on.
[01:15:41.175 --> 01:15:42.136]  All right, stay there.
[01:15:42.176 --> 01:15:43.917]  And I've got mainline Senate reports.
[01:15:44.357 --> 01:15:48.420]  Cloud ionization, electric rainmaking, and laser-guided weather modification.
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:52.883]  This is even in mainstream newspapers that the Arab countries don't hide this.
[01:15:52.903 --> 01:15:53.503]  They're proud of it.
[01:15:53.763 --> 01:16:01.048]  They're turning the desert green with antennas that are ionizing and creating particulate for rain.
[01:16:01.388 --> 01:16:01.869]  I want to explain.
[01:16:09.369 --> 01:16:11.611]  Michael Malice is our guest.
[01:16:12.472 --> 01:16:14.473]  He has traveled to North Korea repeatedly.
[01:16:14.493 --> 01:16:15.694]  He's written a best-selling book.
[01:16:15.855 --> 01:16:20.679]  Fiction couldn't make up, uh, It the Clown Creature, like Kim Jong-un.
[01:16:21.199 --> 01:16:27.124]  He's running around like a hobbled tyrannosaurus feeding on humanity.
[01:16:27.425 --> 01:16:31.588]  I hate Kim Jong-un, but the poor people, it's like, what do we do?
[01:16:32.089 --> 01:16:32.709]  You've been there.
[01:16:32.769 --> 01:16:35.071]  I mean, these people are literally on another planet.
[01:16:35.151 --> 01:16:35.672]  What do we do?
[01:16:36.901 --> 01:16:39.142]  I mean, there is no easy answer.
[01:16:39.422 --> 01:16:44.745]  The only thing we can do is put pressure on China, and China has started to buckle, which is a very good sign.
[01:16:45.025 --> 01:16:48.426]  It's easy for North Korea when it's us versus them, when it's the U.S.
[01:16:48.466 --> 01:16:50.387]  imperialists, as they call us, versus them.
[01:16:50.787 --> 01:16:56.550]  But now when you have the international community uniting, including their big brother China, that's a very different dynamic.
[01:16:56.870 --> 01:17:00.431]  And it's a better dynamic, because why is this our problem entirely?
[01:17:00.451 --> 01:17:01.332]  And you're an expert on this.
[01:17:01.372 --> 01:17:03.573]  Let's talk about the North Korean-China relationship.
[01:17:03.613 --> 01:17:05.714]  Why has China been going along with this for 50 years?
[01:17:06.534 --> 01:17:09.338]  China doesn't want a US ally on their border.
[01:17:09.878 --> 01:17:15.845]  China doesn't want 25 million North Korean refugees crossing the river and living in China where they have nothing to offer.
[01:17:16.486 --> 01:17:23.174]  And China basically doesn't... No one wants a collapsed state on their border that they have to basically deal with the problem.
[01:17:23.254 --> 01:17:25.035]  I mean, are we closer to midnight than ever?
[01:17:25.055 --> 01:17:28.856]  Because most experts I talk to say if there's nuclear war, it's going to start in North Korea, not the Middle East.
[01:17:29.316 --> 01:17:31.236]  Not in Ukraine, not on the border of Russia.
[01:17:31.556 --> 01:17:34.277]  I mean, what do you think of the experts you talk to?
[01:17:34.717 --> 01:17:36.958]  Because, I mean, you're all over the place talking to top experts.
[01:17:37.398 --> 01:17:38.859]  I mean, how serious is this?
[01:17:38.899 --> 01:17:39.599]  I got four children.
[01:17:39.619 --> 01:17:39.959]  I want to know.
[01:17:41.122 --> 01:17:42.162]  I think it's good.
[01:17:42.202 --> 01:17:42.923]  Your kids are fine.
[01:17:43.283 --> 01:17:44.043]  Your kids are safe.
[01:17:44.863 --> 01:17:50.544]  North Korea, in their literature, constantly talk about the fact, we know we can't win.
[01:17:51.165 --> 01:17:52.985]  They say this explicitly.
[01:17:53.425 --> 01:17:57.786]  So they're not... Listen, everyone talks about how he's crazy and suicidal.
[01:17:57.986 --> 01:17:59.167]  He's satanic, like you said.
[01:17:59.487 --> 01:18:02.107]  If he's suicidal, they've been around for 70 years.
[01:18:02.347 --> 01:18:04.128]  That's taken a long time to kill yourself, huh?
[01:18:04.328 --> 01:18:05.708]  Alex, you touched on it earlier.
[01:18:05.748 --> 01:18:09.009]  They have something called the monolithic ideological system.
[01:18:09.469 --> 01:18:15.772]  By which they mean everyone in the country thinks the same way and thinks in line with the leader.
[01:18:16.273 --> 01:18:21.075]  So they boast about the fact that there's no independent thought in the entire country.
[01:18:21.816 --> 01:18:29.580]  That it's the leader, which is a human being, this fat kid like you said, who gives the people their political spiritual life.
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:33.482]  And that without the leader, basically, no one would exist.
[01:18:33.662 --> 01:18:38.524]  So, it's a very dark quasi-religion that they push on the people.
[01:18:38.544 --> 01:18:47.148]  And again, when you're this demigod at the head of a country, and you're effectively a billionaire, what would it take for you to, you know, quit your job?
[01:18:47.468 --> 01:18:48.509]  It's going to take a lot.
[01:18:49.049 --> 01:18:52.691]  And it's going to take a combination of threats and rewards.
[01:18:53.351 --> 01:18:56.773]  And Kim Jong-un doesn't want to go the way of Gaddafi or Saddam Hussein.
[01:19:02.546 --> 01:19:06.087]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[01:19:06.548 --> 01:19:12.590]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:15.791]  It is the new t-shirt from infowarsstore.com.
[01:19:16.171 --> 01:19:19.172]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:19:19.372 --> 01:19:22.814]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[01:19:23.154 --> 01:19:23.614]  The left
[01:19:24.154 --> 01:19:34.580]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:37.042]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[01:19:37.522 --> 01:19:41.384]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[01:19:41.444 --> 01:19:49.529]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate the image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:19:49.769 --> 01:19:52.471]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter,
[01:19:52.871 --> 01:19:56.013]  It will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[01:19:56.093 --> 01:19:57.794]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[01:19:57.934 --> 01:19:59.135]  It's available right now.
[01:19:59.435 --> 01:20:01.997]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[01:20:07.341 --> 01:20:10.022]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:21.599 --> 01:20:32.508]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[01:20:36.711 --> 01:20:39.333]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:42.725 --> 01:20:43.646]  So here's what's happening.
[01:20:43.866 --> 01:20:46.567]  I'm just a lay researcher that reads government documents.
[01:20:46.827 --> 01:20:47.468]  Public stuff.
[01:20:47.508 --> 01:20:57.154]  And they admit global weather treaties, plans to reduce world population, post-industrial world, race-specific bioweapons.
[01:20:57.214 --> 01:21:00.576]  I've got Department of Defense press briefings admitting it from 1997.
[01:21:00.976 --> 01:21:02.937]  I've got UN treaties.
[01:21:02.977 --> 01:21:04.418]  They're all on Infowars.com.
[01:21:04.438 --> 01:21:07.400]  And then I talk to all the scientists.
[01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:17.303]  Astrophysicists, meteorologists, they say, listen, the geoengineering that's going on is what you do to fry the planet, poison the soil, and kill people.
[01:21:17.764 --> 01:21:20.445]  So what is omnicide?
[01:21:20.545 --> 01:21:22.185]  What is planetary death?
[01:21:22.726 --> 01:21:26.107]  And what's the evidence showing that that's the direction they're going in?
[01:21:27.856 --> 01:21:34.238]  Again, we've got Dane Wigington of geoengineeringwatch.org, an amazing researcher I've known for over 10 years.
[01:21:35.158 --> 01:21:36.179]  Clearly this is happening.
[01:21:36.199 --> 01:21:36.979]  The evidence shows it.
[01:21:37.119 --> 01:21:37.619]  What is it?
[01:21:37.899 --> 01:21:38.539]  What's behind it?
[01:21:38.579 --> 01:21:39.580]  We've got 10 minutes left.
[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:41.380]  Just spill your guts.
[01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:43.901]  Tell folks what they need to know about this omnicide.
[01:21:45.396 --> 01:21:52.260]  On the side would express the disintegration of the entire web of life on the planet, and that is absolutely the track we're on.
[01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:59.764]  We can debate all the various causes, but if we look at this mathematically speaking, the single greatest assault against the web of life today is climate engineering.
[01:21:59.844 --> 01:22:08.108]  Alex, if I could plug this into something you said earlier in our first segment about the climate engineering particulates trapping more heat than they deflect, which is exactly correct.
[01:22:08.803 --> 01:22:37.615]  So, if we look at the stated purpose of climate engineering, primary stated purpose, solar radiation management to block some of the sun's incoming thermal radiation, when all available data makes clear that they are actually fueling the disintegration of the climate and the warming at the same time by trapping more heat than they deflect, destroying the ozone layer, disrupting the hydrological cycle, single greatest factor with the massive forest burndowns, contrary to what the environmental groups would tell us, is not just
[01:22:38.698 --> 01:22:40.179]  Anthropogenic factors as a whole.
[01:22:40.259 --> 01:22:47.506]  It's climate engineering, because climate engineering poisons the soils, shreds the ozone layer, more UV exposure, more dry lightning.
[01:22:47.926 --> 01:22:49.707]  We have an incendiary dust on the foliage.
[01:22:49.828 --> 01:22:50.588]  I could go on and on.
[01:22:50.648 --> 01:23:01.257]  So we have major factors that are most directly related to climate engineering, and that all fuels the feedback mechanisms that are disintegrating climate system, which feeds into the omnicide that's occurring right now.
[01:23:01.337 --> 01:23:03.079]  So Alex, let's look at the logic behind this.
[01:23:03.809 --> 01:23:08.030]  Solar radiation management to give the Earth a higher albedo, a higher reflectivity.
[01:23:08.371 --> 01:23:09.891]  Let's take Venus in comparison.
[01:23:09.931 --> 01:23:17.914]  If this was the only way to, or this was a method by which you could actually cool the planet, if that's their goal, let's look at Venus.
[01:23:17.954 --> 01:23:21.435]  Venus's albedo is two and a half times that of planet Earth.
[01:23:21.755 --> 01:23:27.297]  I was about to say, Al Gore told us 20 years ago we're going to become Venus, then the scientists are doing just what you do to turn us into that.
[01:23:28.174 --> 01:23:30.236]  Well, it's feeding Venus syndrome.
[01:23:30.276 --> 01:23:31.897]  Geoengineering is fueling Venus syndrome.
[01:23:31.937 --> 01:23:33.158]  We have articles in GeoGearingWatch.
[01:23:33.559 --> 01:23:38.463]  Anybody who wants to search GeoGearingWatch.org and then plug in whatever title they want to find, they should find an article about it.
[01:23:38.483 --> 01:23:39.824]  So, back to Venus.
[01:23:40.264 --> 01:23:45.109]  Venus is two and a half times more reflective than Earth and it's 900 degrees on the ground.
[01:23:45.489 --> 01:23:51.114]  Obviously, it's not just your reflective atmosphere that keeps a planet in a mode where it supports life.
[01:23:51.814 --> 01:23:57.579]  And Venus, all things being equal, and many people don't know this, Alex, Venus would be 20 to 25 degrees warmer than Earth.
[01:23:58.119 --> 01:24:03.083]  Not 900 degrees at Underwinter Runaway Greenhouse, and that reflective atmosphere didn't help much.
[01:24:03.103 --> 01:24:07.046]  So, we're back to climate engineering, uniting the tribes on all sides of the fence.
[01:24:07.566 --> 01:24:11.629]  Climate engineering will be the biggest nail in our collective coffins if it continues.
[01:24:11.709 --> 01:24:26.180]  I was about to say, I'm not even a scientist, but they admit that what they're doing with this engineering causes the light to go through, but stay and not bounce back out, and it's actually causing this, and the soils are full of aluminum, and all this is happening.
[01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:27.301]  Are these mad scientists?
[01:24:27.321 --> 01:24:28.181]  What's wrong with them?
[01:24:29.202 --> 01:24:30.263]  Again, you have
[01:24:31.559 --> 01:24:36.840]  In any form of human activity that affects the energy balance of the planet is a form of geoengineering.
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:41.622]  But the intentional climate intervention programs being mathematically the greatest disrupting factor of all.
[01:24:42.142 --> 01:24:47.743]  And quite simply this is human insanity at its epitome Alex.
[01:24:47.823 --> 01:24:54.185]  And not only is it destroying the biosphere your life support systems it's toxifying every breath we take toxifying soils.
[01:24:55.009 --> 01:24:59.492]  And I encourage your listeners, we don't ask anybody to believe anything we say at GeoengineeringWatch.org.
[01:24:59.532 --> 01:25:04.215]  We ask you to examine the data, our data from our NASA engineer that works with us.
[01:25:04.655 --> 01:25:11.740]  And Alex, in regard to Mr. Trump, something I thought you should know about this, and let's hope that, you know, there's some different course of action that we see already.
[01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:23.347]  One of the Air Force generals that works directly with us at GeoengineeringWatch.org, he's a retired Major General, had Mr. Trump's top campaign people and Mr. Carson's top campaign people in his home January 2016.
[01:25:25.140 --> 01:25:32.388]  On a meeting strictly about geoengineering, he supplied data that was given to him by geoengineeringwatch.org, so we know they know.
[01:25:32.629 --> 01:25:33.710]  There's no question about that.
[01:25:33.770 --> 01:25:37.574]  Unfortunately, right now, what we see is a ramping up of these programs, not a scaling back.
[01:25:38.395 --> 01:25:42.420]  And over the oceans is where a lot of people don't know how much climate engineering is going on.
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:45.844]  When we look at NASA imagery, which I examine every day from all over the globe,
[01:25:46.384 --> 01:25:49.368]  The amount of spraying going on over our oceans, Alex, is unimaginable.
[01:25:49.388 --> 01:25:50.889]  Well, this is Trump's blind spot.
[01:25:51.009 --> 01:25:53.972]  He loves America so much, he thinks the military is America.
[01:25:54.293 --> 01:25:57.797]  And sure, the average person in the military is sacrificing some of our best people, in my experience.
[01:25:58.117 --> 01:25:58.738]  I love veterans.
[01:25:59.158 --> 01:26:01.240]  But some of these generals are really whacked out.
[01:26:01.300 --> 01:26:03.182]  Some of them are really great people, like the one you're talking about.
[01:26:04.008 --> 01:26:07.110]  And they're fighting hard, but yeah, he just lets them do whatever they want.
[01:26:07.410 --> 01:26:07.931]  It's well known.
[01:26:07.951 --> 01:26:10.332]  He goes to the CIA, he says, you're great, do whatever you want.
[01:26:10.632 --> 01:26:13.174]  He goes to the Department of Energy, do whatever you want if it helps America.
[01:26:13.514 --> 01:26:15.716]  He really believes in the scientists and people.
[01:26:16.036 --> 01:26:23.261]  He doesn't like bankers and bureaucrats and people, but he does tend to just believe in whiz kid stuff and kind of just sign stuff over.
[01:26:24.372 --> 01:26:26.753]  I think you and I would agree there's a lot of great people in the U.S.
[01:26:26.773 --> 01:26:33.474]  military, and they're being told that these operations are some planetary saving measure, and that couldn't be further from the truth.
[01:26:33.514 --> 01:26:43.137]  By the way, it shows how deep, that's what I've been told by generals and people currently in, is they're told they're saving the ozone, but the science shows it's killing it, and let's go back to it.
[01:26:43.157 --> 01:26:43.877]  This is important.
[01:26:44.737 --> 01:26:48.138]  Because it's the same thing they do with this compartmentalization.
[01:26:48.178 --> 01:26:51.919]  They have kids' textbooks saying they're spraying sunscreen.
[01:26:52.139 --> 01:27:01.222]  So they admit to children that geoengineering's happening, and Bill Gates is making little videos for kids at school, but then they tell us as adults, don't discuss it, it's not happening.
[01:27:02.912 --> 01:27:03.793]  Well, here's the bottom line.
[01:27:03.833 --> 01:27:09.616]  We have to get this issue to light immediately and everyone can play their part in that if they share credible data.
[01:27:09.676 --> 01:27:10.497]  As I stated earlier... No, I agree.
[01:27:10.517 --> 01:27:11.337]  And it's all on your site.
[01:27:11.377 --> 01:27:12.218]  So let me ask you this.
[01:27:12.238 --> 01:27:13.438]  So you're talking to the high-level military.
[01:27:13.759 --> 01:27:15.820]  They're being told this is an earth-saving event.
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:17.261]  They are.
[01:27:17.521 --> 01:27:25.446]  And this is where, again, that's really... Well, I was told by a high-level operative, they were told when it started 20 years ago, they believe a global ice age was going to begin by 2020.
[01:27:26.166 --> 01:27:32.650]  And so they, as if you could predict it, but it is time in the next couple hundred years probably to start, that they're stopping global cooling.
[01:27:34.662 --> 01:27:37.584]  Well, the official science data would say exactly the opposite.
[01:27:37.604 --> 01:27:43.788]  They're trying to slow a runaway greenhouse effect, and the actual data from the ground would say they're fueling that effect, not stopping it.
[01:27:44.248 --> 01:27:49.211]  As you correctly stated in the first segment, they're trapping more heat than they deflect, destroying the ozone layer, and so forth.
[01:27:49.231 --> 01:27:50.552]  So, back to the ozone layer.
[01:27:50.892 --> 01:28:01.639]  Aside from any other environmental discussion, if we had no other environmental problems, the ozone layer alone, if it collapses, current data indicates that could occur and will occur on the current trajectory in four to eight years, game over.
[01:28:02.999 --> 01:28:03.179]  Over.
[01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:09.241]  So again, the readings we're getting right now from the official sources are all completely fictitious.
[01:28:09.261 --> 01:28:10.702]  They have no bearing in reality.
[01:28:10.742 --> 01:28:16.904]  They don't measure any UV radiation below 300 nanometers, and the DNA damaging bands of UVC are below that.
[01:28:16.944 --> 01:28:19.385]  So you can't find what you're not looking for, Alex.
[01:28:19.405 --> 01:28:24.587]  We're simply not being told that we're being bathed in dangerous UV radiation, lethal UV radiation, right now.
[01:28:25.547 --> 01:28:26.969]  And by the way, I don't just believe you.
[01:28:27.489 --> 01:28:28.170]  We had it up earlier.
[01:28:28.190 --> 01:28:29.291]  We have the earthquake monitors.
[01:28:29.311 --> 01:28:30.673]  We have all the government data.
[01:28:30.693 --> 01:28:32.655]  When you said that today, I saw it a few years ago.
[01:28:32.695 --> 01:28:35.317]  I went, look, they admit UV is the highest ever recorded.
[01:28:35.337 --> 01:28:37.820]  Do five more minutes with us.
[01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:40.903]  I want to look specifically with you about what
[01:28:42.317 --> 01:29:01.503]  ozone collapse would look like as we know it's not just holes it is being depleted and as you said it's not what's in our spray bottles what's happening why is it being depleted so fast because we know UVs up all over the planet what's going on skin cancer is way up why is this happening we'll be back folks stay with us
[01:29:02.907 --> 01:29:09.090]  And everybody will have lower rates, better quality care, and better access.
[01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:14.872]  I don't remember saying that everybody in the country would have a lower premium.
[01:29:15.952 --> 01:29:21.275]  That's why your spotlight on the cockroaches, Alex, is so important.
[01:29:21.295 --> 01:29:25.136]  That's really what we the people, that's what our job is.
[01:29:25.156 --> 01:29:26.737]  Oh, this guy isn't doing too good.
[01:29:26.777 --> 01:29:28.518]  Ted Nugent was telling me about this guy.
[01:29:29.518 --> 01:29:31.539]  He looks like he's pretty sick.
[01:29:33.353 --> 01:29:34.455]  Is that Nancy Pelosi?
[01:29:34.515 --> 01:29:37.119]  Or is that... Is that Chuckie Schumer?
[01:29:37.139 --> 01:29:39.342]  Or is that... What's her name?
[01:29:39.522 --> 01:29:42.086]  The one that can't remember who attacked Korea.
[01:29:42.106 --> 01:29:42.927]  She thinks it was Putin.
[01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:54.309]  And the fact that he is wrapping his arms around Putin while Putin is continuing to advance into Korea.
[01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:57.651]  Believe me, Pelosi is the enemy.
[01:29:57.951 --> 01:30:00.754]  Maxine Waters, I don't even know what planet she's from.
[01:30:00.814 --> 01:30:11.482]  I mean, the Democrats, the left, the liberals, these are strange, bizarre, anti-logic, anti-American freaks, each and every one of them.
[01:30:12.483 --> 01:30:13.724]  I'm doing what Ted Nugent told me.
[01:30:15.705 --> 01:30:17.086]  He said turn the lights on, Pat.
[01:30:18.087 --> 01:30:18.707]  That light over there.
[01:30:18.727 --> 01:30:19.928]  It's over there.
[01:30:20.589 --> 01:30:21.750]  Right over there.
[01:30:21.790 --> 01:30:22.990]  Ted Nugent said turn the lights on.
[01:30:23.271 --> 01:30:25.432]  Spotlight the cockroaches.
[01:30:25.532 --> 01:30:27.053]  You've perfected that over the years.
[01:30:27.394 --> 01:30:28.534]  Nancy Pelosi's sick.
[01:30:29.055 --> 01:30:30.596]  Nancy Pelosi needs medical attention.
[01:30:31.677 --> 01:30:34.679]  Well, at least it's gonna be natural causes.
[01:30:34.699 --> 01:30:37.361]  Democratic Party has just been screaming racism over and over again.
[01:30:38.281 --> 01:30:38.461]  Man.
[01:30:41.514 --> 01:30:43.157]  Hey ladies, hold on, come on over here.
[01:30:44.579 --> 01:30:46.702]  Nancy Pelosi came by the house, did you know that?
[01:30:47.614 --> 01:31:01.937]  However, these freaks are serious and they threaten to kill our family because we hunt, because we believe in the Second Amendment, because we trounce and spotlight the cockroaches on the left that hate America, hate the Constitution, hate the American dream, hate independence.
[01:31:02.077 --> 01:31:03.037]  Why do they hate it?
[01:31:03.117 --> 01:31:04.057]  Why do they hate it?
[01:31:04.077 --> 01:31:05.258]  Okay, here comes Donald Trump.
[01:31:05.278 --> 01:31:07.378]  Pat, will you please assist me with the camera?
[01:31:08.058 --> 01:31:11.499]  Here comes Donald Trump with the assistance of the American people.
[01:31:12.039 --> 01:31:16.140]  We are going to drain the swamp.
[01:31:22.815 --> 01:31:27.358]  Mr. Moore, your chauffeur is here.
[01:31:28.218 --> 01:31:28.979]  Don't try to get out.
[01:31:29.259 --> 01:31:31.760]  Let me just help you a little bit.
[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:33.141]  Don't be violent or anything like that.
[01:31:33.161 --> 01:31:35.102]  We're not being violent.
[01:31:36.102 --> 01:31:37.363]  Is this cool or what?
[01:31:37.963 --> 01:31:39.664]  No Michael Moores were hurt in the filming of this.
[01:31:39.684 --> 01:31:41.285]  This is a much more useful creature.
[01:31:41.305 --> 01:31:44.407]  A carrion beetle that eats rotten meat.
[01:31:46.529 --> 01:31:48.050]  Oh, let's get all of our friend in there.
[01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:51.393]  We the people are supposed to be hell raisers.
[01:31:51.413 --> 01:31:53.935]  We're not supposed to act like French and Canadians.
[01:31:53.955 --> 01:32:00.881]  Because to be an extremist, to be a radical, are like those Americans who went to Concord Bridge when the British were going to take our guns.
[01:32:00.921 --> 01:32:02.742]  And we didn't sit down and have tea with them.
[01:32:02.963 --> 01:32:04.304]  We shot them in the damn head.
[01:32:04.604 --> 01:32:05.225]  We killed them.
[01:32:05.405 --> 01:32:08.387]  You come to take away our guns, we'll cut you in half.
[01:32:08.587 --> 01:32:10.109]  Somebody write that down.
[01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:13.263]  Bye, Democrat Party!
[01:32:13.283 --> 01:32:15.426]  Oh, and Paul Ryan's down in there too.
[01:32:15.767 --> 01:32:17.109]  Bye-bye, Paul Ryan!
[01:32:17.930 --> 01:32:18.531]  Bye-bye!
[01:32:19.072 --> 01:32:19.453]  Bye-bye!
[01:32:20.484 --> 01:32:22.765]  Look at my wonderful birth city of Detroit.
[01:32:22.785 --> 01:32:38.093]  It was the work ethic epicenter, the productivity epicenter of the globe when I was born in 1948 until Mayor Coleman Young and the Liberal Democrats took over and trained people, brainwashed people, de-souled people that you don't have to try.
[01:32:38.313 --> 01:32:44.736]  You just stay home or you go ahead and make Chrysler products that won't even run and will still send you a bonus check.
[01:32:44.956 --> 01:32:47.938]  But when you give people something, you turn them
[01:32:49.438 --> 01:32:59.922]  The worst thing you can do to a human being is to give him stuff because then he has no pride of work ethic or ownership or earning his own way.
[01:33:06.844 --> 01:33:09.845]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:17.837 --> 01:33:35.190]  So, Hurricane Irma gets us focused on the fact that we've got earthquakes, we've got storms, we've got solar storms that are directly connected to all this.
[01:33:35.730 --> 01:33:36.611]  We've got governments.
[01:33:38.041 --> 01:33:43.184]  Admittedly obsessed with trying to control the weather and manipulate it, and then we have discussions about it.
[01:33:43.204 --> 01:33:46.465]  They attack us despite all the stacks of their own admissions of it.
[01:33:47.386 --> 01:33:52.288]  So it's up to the public to admit this is going on, but let's look at the ozone layer.
[01:33:52.828 --> 01:33:56.150]  Let's look at the fact that more UV radiation is admittedly coming through.
[01:33:57.751 --> 01:34:00.212]  Dane Wigington of geoengineeringwatch.org.
[01:34:00.472 --> 01:34:01.773]  Let's break down what
[01:34:03.052 --> 01:34:08.454]  Collapse of the ozone layer could look like, because it's already starting to happen, as you said, the next four to six years.
[01:34:10.034 --> 01:34:11.995]  That's what it would look like, and we already see that.
[01:34:12.455 --> 01:34:18.697]  In regard to, let's take insect populations, for example, Alex, in Northern California, we work directly with retired Forest Service biologists.
[01:34:18.737 --> 01:34:25.459]  We've seen a 90% decline, 90% in aquatic and terrestrial insect populations in the last 10 years.
[01:34:25.939 --> 01:34:29.420]  This is from the heavy metal contamination and the UV, 90%.
[01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:31.501]  If the insects die, how long are we going to be around?
[01:34:32.156 --> 01:34:37.720]  In regard to the military-industrial complex propensity to keep doubling down on everything they do.
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:44.364]  So the more they spray, the more damage they do, the more ozone destruction they cause, the more they feel they have to spray to provide a shield from
[01:34:45.248 --> 01:34:47.870]  The destruction that was caused by what they were doing in the first place.
[01:34:48.050 --> 01:34:49.711]  So this is the mentality we're dealing with.
[01:34:50.231 --> 01:34:54.494]  And now, Alex, on the earlier segment I mentioned to you that the atmosphere is filling with methane.
[01:34:54.514 --> 01:34:56.035]  That's something that we all need to discuss.
[01:34:56.075 --> 01:34:57.316]  It's not calf flatulence.
[01:34:57.396 --> 01:35:02.719]  It's massive methane deposits that are thawing, freezing, and entering the atmosphere, covering the planet like a layer of gas.
[01:35:02.739 --> 01:35:05.661]  So what's the Military-Industrial Complex response to that?
[01:35:06.121 --> 01:35:08.283]  Project Lucy and Project Alamo.
[01:35:08.923 --> 01:35:10.184]  Continue to break this down!
[01:35:29.130 --> 01:35:35.735]  Well, again, on the current path, if we don't deal with this issue first and foremost, we'll have a planet that doesn't support life much longer.
[01:35:35.775 --> 01:35:37.196]  It's already waning rapidly.
[01:35:37.256 --> 01:35:39.478]  So we're back to what's our priority?
[01:35:39.498 --> 01:35:40.799]  What's our obvious priority?
[01:35:40.879 --> 01:35:46.824]  And people from every side of the fence, while they're arguing about the state of the climate, why wouldn't we unite on a common cause?
[01:35:46.924 --> 01:35:50.787]  Unite the tribes on a common cause of exposing climate engineering?
[01:35:50.807 --> 01:35:54.670]  Because again, you can't have any discussion about the climate without dealing with this issue first.
[01:35:55.530 --> 01:36:03.178]  I would argue that we have to all pull this load together and get this issue to the light of day or very soon we'll have nothing left to salvage on.
[01:36:03.318 --> 01:36:04.599]  Alex, that's a mathematical fact.
[01:36:06.541 --> 01:36:09.424]  What's wrong with the technocracy that's doing this?
[01:36:11.445 --> 01:36:14.286]  Well, I would compare it to a cancer, Alex, and I have many times.
[01:36:14.486 --> 01:36:16.066]  Does a cancer intend to kill its host?
[01:36:16.166 --> 01:36:19.988]  No, it intends to proliferate at any cost and the host eventually dies.
[01:36:20.428 --> 01:36:26.410]  So we have all these companies, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, all invested in this technology.
[01:36:26.430 --> 01:36:36.913]  We have the disaster capitalists like Monsanto that's reaping, as you correctly stated earlier, again, genetically modified seeds, aluminum resistant, UV resistant seeds, abiotic stress resistant seeds.
[01:36:37.573 --> 01:36:41.916]  All capitalizing on the decimation being caused, but at the same time, the ship's going down by the day.
[01:36:41.956 --> 01:36:46.398]  So this is comparable to pirates on a sinking ship loading their pockets with loot.
[01:36:46.418 --> 01:36:47.499]  How far are they going to get?
[01:36:47.519 --> 01:36:48.619]  Not very far.
[01:36:48.779 --> 01:36:50.240]  We're all going down in the same ship.
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:54.763]  So the bottom line is, above all other issues, we must deal with this issue.
[01:36:55.363 --> 01:36:58.585]  And if we don't, we're on a very, very limited time horizon.
[01:36:58.605 --> 01:37:02.627]  Some of the products I heard on the break that you sell and market,
[01:37:03.488 --> 01:37:10.413]  I would argue, not to put a plug in for Wimpho Wars, but that the storable foods and so forth are essential right now.
[01:37:10.453 --> 01:37:15.937]  If you can't eat it or you can't drink it, it's not going to be worth much to you in the very near future.
[01:37:15.997 --> 01:37:23.042]  So those are very important items that people should think seriously about while they're also at the same time trying to help us sound the alarm.
[01:37:23.082 --> 01:37:24.583]  That's so critical on this issue.
[01:37:24.603 --> 01:37:25.704]  We all have to pull this way.
[01:37:26.547 --> 01:37:30.011]  Dane Willingham, it's been too long since you've been on your site.
[01:37:30.031 --> 01:37:30.953]  It's been years on it.
[01:37:31.433 --> 01:37:33.115]  Great job, you and the scientists, what you're doing.
[01:37:33.155 --> 01:37:34.577]  Let's talk again very soon.
[01:37:34.617 --> 01:37:35.018]  Thank you, sir.
[01:37:35.038 --> 01:37:36.279]  Anytime.
[01:37:37.141 --> 01:37:43.469]  Since we have that perspective, which is an important angle, let's go to a Dr. William Soon, Harvard.
[01:37:45.663 --> 01:37:54.917]  Geophysicist and astrophysicist on what's happening with the sun's effect on the earth that the globals are trying to manipulate but can't fully control.
[01:37:54.957 --> 01:37:56.600]  As Stan Dale earlier agreed, here it is.
[01:37:59.068 --> 01:38:12.018]  Yes, Professor Willie Soon is a solar scientist, an astrophysicist, and a researcher out of Harvard, and he's very well skilled and knowledged into solar cycles.
[01:38:12.178 --> 01:38:25.488]  And so we're going to be joined by Dr. Willie, and he's going to be able to really kind of get deep in there and explain to us how the sun actually has a bigger impact on our environment than us as man, which is
[01:38:25.848 --> 01:38:27.049]  It's such common sense.
[01:38:27.109 --> 01:38:28.869]  I mean, it really is common sense.
[01:38:29.330 --> 01:38:43.536]  And it's kind of, we're trying to dispel the hysteria out there that somehow if we don't do A, B, C, and D and let these scientists dictate policy, then we are going to have the end of the world happen.
[01:38:44.017 --> 01:38:49.579]  So really and truly, that's why it's so important that we have Professor Willie Soon come on and talk to us.
[01:38:49.859 --> 01:38:53.401]  By the way, I live in Salem, Massachusetts, so we are very familiar with that.
[01:38:53.843 --> 01:38:55.764]  Well-known phenomenon called witch burning.
[01:38:56.264 --> 01:39:13.749]  Indeed, those are during the time where all this, you know, very, very sad situation where they were having some kind of bad weather and where people decided to prosecute a lot of these so-called women that went crazy and, you know, the witches, they call them, for brewing up this bad weather.
[01:39:13.809 --> 01:39:22.431]  I mean, it seems to me, even by 21st century, things doesn't change as much for those who insist that cover the outside, which is one of these
[01:39:23.035 --> 01:39:26.517]  What you call minor greenhouse gas, that's a very important point to stress.
[01:39:27.017 --> 01:39:30.538]  Minor simply because its effect is known to be very small.
[01:39:30.999 --> 01:39:35.821]  Because a major greenhouse gas in the atmosphere of planet Earth is water vapour.
[01:39:37.081 --> 01:39:44.945]  I've been very fond of saying, if you want to study the effect of greenhouse effect on the Earth planet, all you need to do is study water vapour.
[01:39:44.985 --> 01:39:45.345]  That's it.
[01:39:45.725 --> 01:39:46.646]  That's all you need to do.
[01:39:47.186 --> 01:39:49.447]  That's why the Sun argument is so convincing.
[01:39:49.907 --> 01:39:51.928]  Because it does vary in a cyclical way.
[01:39:52.743 --> 01:39:58.147]  Not every 11 years, every 60 years or so, every 200 years, every 1,000 years, that sort of thing.
[01:39:58.247 --> 01:39:59.367]  We have seen those cycles.
[01:39:59.708 --> 01:40:02.729]  We have seen all of those cycles, actually, from actual data.
[01:40:02.749 --> 01:40:11.495]  This is why the argument is more and more convincing as far as I can tell you, I mean, or even in any scientific open discussion or debate, you know?
[01:40:11.855 --> 01:40:15.037]  So this is indeed a very fruitful direction to go.
[01:40:15.177 --> 01:40:20.120]  And in fact, I have to tell you, all the money they spent the last 10 to 20 years,
[01:40:21.894 --> 01:40:25.958]  I mean, they barely give 85% to studying the sun in that sense.
[01:40:26.398 --> 01:40:33.164]  They spend 95% of those wasted money on computer climate models that is almost useless in my sense.
[01:40:33.684 --> 01:40:35.726]  Because all they do is just copying each other.
[01:40:35.746 --> 01:40:40.610]  In fact, the whole world now has about 30 climate models, each of them copying from each other.
[01:40:40.631 --> 01:40:43.273]  It's as if they're doing some serious hard work, okay?
[01:40:43.666 --> 01:40:46.367]  And we actually see some of the strongest hurricanes that we know about.
[01:40:46.648 --> 01:40:53.751]  Certainly the one that has the most number of casualties on continental USA was the Galveston Hurricane of 1900.
[01:40:53.992 --> 01:41:00.175]  There wasn't much man-made pollution at that point in time, but we can go even farther back to 1780.
[01:41:00.335 --> 01:41:02.816]  And that hurricane, the one in 1900, that killed about 12,000 people in the US.
[01:41:06.639 --> 01:41:06.959]  That's right.
[01:41:24.994 --> 01:41:29.036]  There were dozens of ships, tens of thousands of people that were lost at sea.
[01:41:29.356 --> 01:41:30.276]  The ships were overturned.
[01:41:30.797 --> 01:41:39.081]  And the devastation, as described, makes people realize that that was one of, if not the strongest Atlantic hurricane that we've ever had.
[01:41:39.121 --> 01:41:39.921]  And that was in 1780.
[01:41:40.221 --> 01:41:42.602]  So we see these things happening cyclically.
[01:41:42.982 --> 01:41:49.926]  And there is no explanation that is going to explain this that is focused strictly on recent
[01:41:50.606 --> 01:41:55.630]  Additions to carbon dioxide that they say are increasing linearly as we're going along.
[01:41:55.670 --> 01:41:56.871]  We see something that is cyclical.
[01:41:57.551 --> 01:41:58.032]  That's right.
[01:41:58.092 --> 01:42:00.033]  This is why science is all about numbers, too.
[01:42:00.093 --> 01:42:04.577]  I mean, the numbers for atmospheric carbon dioxide just doesn't add up.
[01:42:04.777 --> 01:42:09.080]  In fact, maybe it's a bad time to tell another joke.
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:17.787]  If those who really want to insist on carbon dioxide causing all the damages from Harvey and Irma, I think we should look for checks from Al Gore and
[01:42:18.345 --> 01:42:20.526]  John Kerry, Obama, and who else?
[01:42:20.626 --> 01:42:21.907]  I mean, DiCaprio.
[01:42:21.947 --> 01:42:23.288]  I mean, those guys should write a check.
[01:42:24.268 --> 01:42:26.970]  That's one of the top astrophysicists on the planet from Harvard.
[01:42:27.970 --> 01:42:30.492]  Most scientists say this man-made global warming thing's a fraud.
[01:42:30.552 --> 01:42:32.333]  It's the sun, folks.
[01:42:32.353 --> 01:42:35.034]  1,300,000 Earths fit inside of it.
[01:42:35.755 --> 01:42:37.015]  It's what makes us have the summer.
[01:42:37.716 --> 01:42:39.176]  It's what causes the hurricanes.
[01:42:39.416 --> 01:42:40.477]  It runs the whole show.
[01:42:41.278 --> 01:42:42.138]  It gives us sunburns.
[01:42:42.178 --> 01:42:42.638]  It does everything.
[01:42:42.658 --> 01:42:43.679]  But without it, we're dead.
[01:42:44.719 --> 01:42:45.940]  So, I pray to Jesus.
[01:42:45.980 --> 01:42:46.740]  That's my God.
[01:42:46.820 --> 01:42:49.081]  But if I was an atheist, I'd worship the sun.
[01:42:49.841 --> 01:42:50.621]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:50.661 --> 01:42:51.622]  Thanks for all your support.
[01:42:51.662 --> 01:42:56.344]  We have big sales that end tomorrow at Infowarsstore.com on a lot of great products.
[01:42:56.404 --> 01:42:57.764]  Be sure to take advantage of that.

[01:43:00.786 --> 01:43:01.486]  Thanks for your support.
[01:43:08.061 --> 01:43:12.865]  An illegal teenage immigrant from Honduras has been charged with killing his mother.
[01:43:13.025 --> 01:43:18.809]  Punez is a so-called dreamer protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.
[01:43:20.210 --> 01:43:25.134]  A truck had smashed the family's car on the right side.
[01:43:25.534 --> 01:43:27.856]  That's where Lennox was sitting in his little car seat.
[01:43:28.296 --> 01:43:32.279]  Border officials say Banda is a Mexican national in the country illegally.
[01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:34.521]  He's been deported 15 times in 15 years.
[01:43:37.523 --> 01:43:47.708]  Uvia Lopez has a sordid story that includes a prior deportation and identity fraud in addition to the sexual assault of a friend's teenage daughter.
[01:43:48.049 --> 01:43:52.711]  But I have a simple message today for every gang member and criminal alien.
[01:43:53.531 --> 01:44:00.215]  We will find you, we will arrest you, we will jail you, and we will deport you.
[01:44:10.819 --> 01:44:12.681]  He was deported a whopping eight times.
[01:44:13.001 --> 01:44:15.623]  Suspected in a deadly hit-and-run earlier this week.
[01:44:15.903 --> 01:44:20.987]  He's charged with sex abuse, sodomy, burglary, robbery, assault and kidnapping.
[01:44:21.247 --> 01:44:25.290]  Court records show he's been deported and returned 20 different times.
[01:44:25.490 --> 01:44:28.432]  The father of two killed in a horrifying crash.
[01:44:28.832 --> 01:44:33.615]  Police say that the driver was a drunk, unlicensed, illegal immigrant.
[01:44:33.855 --> 01:44:40.538]  According to an ICE news release, he is a known gang member and has been previously deported four times.
[01:44:41.059 --> 01:44:49.163]  Tonight, police say an illegal immigrant with a blood alcohol level three times the legal limit slammed into the back of an SUV carrying a family of four.
[01:44:49.643 --> 01:44:52.284]  He had been arrested just hours before this crash.
[01:45:00.319 --> 01:45:08.909]  A woman telling deputies she was sure she was going to die after deputies say this man, Juan Ortega Orozco, broke into her home and crept into her bed.
[01:45:08.989 --> 01:45:10.530]  He's in this country illegally.
[01:45:11.992 --> 01:45:14.915]  He has a rich criminal history of violating the law.
[01:45:15.035 --> 01:45:21.322]  In the past two years, he's been charged with five felonies, including trafficking meth and leading the scene of a crash.
[01:45:32.935 --> 01:45:41.421]  Jermaine Daniels says in a taint from under the Obama administration, federal agents now appear to be rounding up any undocumented person they come in contact with.
[01:45:41.462 --> 01:45:45.104]  Federal agents eating breakfast one minute, arresting restaurant staff the next.
[01:45:45.605 --> 01:45:48.887]  Illegal border crossings are down reportedly 70%.
[01:45:49.828 --> 01:45:55.412]  Arrests inside the country are up 40% and demands for removal up 80% as well.
[01:45:56.993 --> 01:46:00.097]  But, you know, we can't apologize for enforcing the law.
[01:46:00.117 --> 01:46:04.122]  If you break the law, that's a choice that you make, and there are consequences to that.
[01:46:33.004 --> 01:46:37.627]  We have private labeled it, and it is the exact same product, just the name is different.
[01:46:37.807 --> 01:46:38.688]  Emmerich's Essentials.
[01:46:39.048 --> 01:46:40.989]  It's on average 20% off.
[01:46:41.250 --> 01:46:46.493]  On top of that, if you sign up for auto ship, you get an additional 25% off.
[01:46:46.873 --> 01:46:56.340]  Emmerich's Essentials is all about personal care, hygiene, not getting skin cancer, not getting bit by a bunch of bugs and mosquitoes.
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:46:57.821]  It's all there.
[01:46:58.101 --> 01:47:02.784]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, and you'll find Emmerich's Essentials.
[01:47:06.967 --> 01:47:09.709]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:25.601 --> 01:47:29.524]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:47:30.065 --> 01:47:31.486]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:36.115 --> 01:47:38.956]  I keep putting the sun up because that's what drives our weather.
[01:47:40.936 --> 01:47:42.597]  The globalists can try to manipulate it.
[01:47:42.617 --> 01:47:43.617]  They can try to control it.
[01:47:45.177 --> 01:47:45.717]  But they don't.
[01:47:47.358 --> 01:47:52.059]  It's the equivalent of 1.3 million Earths.
[01:47:52.079 --> 01:47:52.379]  1,300,000 Earths.
[01:47:53.039 --> 01:47:55.720]  It's a giant, thermonuclear explosion.
[01:47:56.620 --> 01:47:57.300]  Ongoing.
[01:47:57.940 --> 01:47:59.601]  It's got such great mass.
[01:48:00.221 --> 01:48:02.881]  A lot of suns implode, they think, and make black holes.
[01:48:03.342 --> 01:48:04.942]  But its mass is so great,
[01:48:06.215 --> 01:48:08.697]  That it just contains the explosion.
[01:48:09.218 --> 01:48:10.118]  What creates the black hole?
[01:48:10.138 --> 01:48:24.230]  A space-time warp where it's so huge it rips the dimensional firmament and remember equations knew this 200 years ago before they even found it and then goes into another universe.
[01:48:25.130 --> 01:48:25.411]  Wow!
[01:48:26.638 --> 01:48:29.703]  We are alive in an incredible time, and there are elites.
[01:48:30.224 --> 01:48:32.508]  Let me say this is one of the most important things I've ever said.
[01:48:32.548 --> 01:48:33.229]  Listen to me carefully.
[01:48:33.550 --> 01:48:34.712]  I know you already know this innately.
[01:48:34.732 --> 01:48:36.214]  You're going to say, we already know that, Alex.
[01:48:36.635 --> 01:48:38.779]  But we need to understand this and talk about it.
[01:48:42.110 --> 01:48:44.673]  The globalists are the technocracy.
[01:48:44.733 --> 01:48:45.814]  They're the priest class.
[01:48:45.894 --> 01:48:46.875]  They're the scientists.
[01:48:47.315 --> 01:48:48.476]  And not all scientists are bad.
[01:48:48.516 --> 01:48:49.297]  Most scientists are great.
[01:48:49.658 --> 01:48:59.387]  But these are very greedy people that have a glimpse of all this, of AI, and life extension, and technology, and everything we've got today would be magic 100 years ago.
[01:49:00.248 --> 01:49:02.270]  It'd be unfathomable 5,000 years ago.
[01:49:04.155 --> 01:49:06.295]  Well, we've already gotten 90% of the way.
[01:49:06.535 --> 01:49:19.538]  There's not much further for us to go until we've got life extension, until technical immortality, until building whole new planets as an individual will be just like... We're made in the image of God.
[01:49:19.658 --> 01:49:21.419]  This is a big prospect.
[01:49:21.919 --> 01:49:25.979]  And there are people that are jealous, who don't want you to have part of this.
[01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:28.560]  And that's the big takeaway.
[01:49:30.675 --> 01:49:43.204]  Is that this is our embryonic, our larval form, and an advanced species like this that God's created is not going to be given the keys to the house, the car, and the company without a test.
[01:49:45.306 --> 01:49:48.468]  We don't just get hatched up on the ceiling in the garage like wasp.
[01:49:50.470 --> 01:49:55.013]  We've got to go through something in a big, real-world simulation.
[01:49:56.554 --> 01:49:57.035]  Live fire!
[01:49:58.029 --> 01:50:00.690]  Like the old days with the Marines and the Army, they really shot bullets over you.
[01:50:00.710 --> 01:50:02.571]  A lot of times people got killed in every class.
[01:50:02.591 --> 01:50:04.512]  They had to get rid of that because of political correctness.
[01:50:04.532 --> 01:50:06.132]  For now, they just call it accidents.
[01:50:06.552 --> 01:50:09.754]  But only real live fire drills test people.
[01:50:10.334 --> 01:50:11.154]  And that's what this is.
[01:50:11.194 --> 01:50:13.195]  And every group knows this is the test.
[01:50:13.535 --> 01:50:14.415]  The big thing's coming.
[01:50:15.476 --> 01:50:16.156]  Happening now.
[01:50:17.837 --> 01:50:19.037]  Marco Island takes hit.
[01:50:19.097 --> 01:50:20.498]  West Coast Florida bullseye.
[01:50:21.158 --> 01:50:21.718]  Down to Cat 2.
[01:50:21.998 --> 01:50:23.439]  Looters in Lauderdale.
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:30.124]  I love how the police report that and they say, Alex Jones and Rush Limbaugh and Matt Drudge are being racist, saying they're looters.
[01:50:30.584 --> 01:50:32.105]  Later they arrest anybody that isn't white.
[01:50:33.366 --> 01:50:35.127]  I think Harvey showed our unity.
[01:50:35.588 --> 01:50:37.089]  I think this will show our unity as well.
[01:50:37.829 --> 01:50:38.870]  I've celebrated our unity.
[01:50:39.190 --> 01:50:39.911]  How do they counter that?
[01:50:39.951 --> 01:50:40.952]  Because it brings us together.
[01:50:41.132 --> 01:50:44.694]  Oh, Alex Jones is against unity.
[01:50:44.734 --> 01:50:45.875]  That's the big lie.
[01:50:46.555 --> 01:50:47.776]  Ladies and gentlemen, just know this.
[01:50:47.856 --> 01:50:49.417]  Hollywood means nothing.
[01:50:51.259 --> 01:50:52.680]  In closing, I want to hit these reports.
[01:50:53.925 --> 01:50:55.606]  Trump calls for tax reform.
[01:50:56.507 --> 01:50:58.188]  Speed up in light of Hurricane Irma.
[01:51:00.109 --> 01:51:07.794]  Talks about how with Texas and Florida, the second and third most popular states, this is really causing a problem.
[01:51:08.194 --> 01:51:14.538]  And he knows, all the economists tell him, you don't cut taxes, the average person, your recovery's going to stall.
[01:51:15.118 --> 01:51:15.979]  That's why I like Trump.
[01:51:16.019 --> 01:51:17.160]  I'm not in a league with Trump.
[01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:21.002]  It'd be great to go after him and get him off my back, but I can't because it's the truth.
[01:51:21.382 --> 01:51:22.063]  He's doing a good job.
[01:51:23.319 --> 01:51:26.081]  Then they bash him and say, oh, he sold out to the Democrats.
[01:51:26.581 --> 01:51:31.584]  The Republican bluebloods are blocking a Republican insurrection in the Freedom Caucus.
[01:51:32.385 --> 01:51:37.728]  Then the bluebloods try to manipulate the Freedom Caucus and say, see, he's selling you out, the Democrats.
[01:51:37.808 --> 01:51:42.512]  No, he tried to get your agenda of Obamacare repeal and tax cuts through.
[01:51:42.532 --> 01:51:43.432]  That's his agenda.
[01:51:43.752 --> 01:51:46.334]  And then the bluebloods killed it with the Democratic leadership.
[01:51:46.634 --> 01:51:48.315]  But all the Democrats want is power.
[01:51:48.716 --> 01:51:51.958]  So Trump doubles back because they want to shut down the economy for three months.
[01:51:52.498 --> 01:51:53.399]  Blame it on Trump.
[01:51:53.719 --> 01:51:56.262]  Have Standard & Poor's and Moody's and Barron's.
[01:51:57.683 --> 01:52:00.006]  Lower our rating, which has been planned.
[01:52:00.026 --> 01:52:01.367]  Have a new depression.
[01:52:01.627 --> 01:52:03.770]  Say it's the repeat of 1929.
[01:52:06.323 --> 01:52:08.044]  With the smooth haulings and all the rest of it.
[01:52:08.844 --> 01:52:10.145]  And Trump's not going that direction.
[01:52:10.185 --> 01:52:14.768]  So he says, OK, I'll get the hurricane relief for Texas, and we know we're going to need it for Florida.
[01:52:15.348 --> 01:52:16.849]  And I'll go ahead and do your deal.
[01:52:16.889 --> 01:52:19.210]  Because he didn't create the big debt.
[01:52:19.250 --> 01:52:20.491]  He didn't create the time bomb.
[01:52:20.711 --> 01:52:24.173]  What kills is tax cuts and then flattening out spending.
[01:52:24.213 --> 01:52:28.716]  He'd already gotten the national debt for the first time in 25 years to go down a little bit.
[01:52:29.727 --> 01:52:34.889]  Just with the exuberance, just cutting the regulations, just cutting the bureaucracy, just promises of tax cuts.
[01:52:35.249 --> 01:52:39.570]  He already had us back there and the globalists go, no, we don't want the prosperity system.
[01:52:39.810 --> 01:52:40.811]  We want to pick and choose.
[01:52:40.851 --> 01:52:42.291]  We want to end Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac.
[01:52:42.531 --> 01:52:43.812]  We don't want small business owners.
[01:52:43.852 --> 01:52:45.812]  We don't want people owning their own houses.
[01:52:45.852 --> 01:52:47.953]  We don't want an upward mobility group.
[01:52:48.153 --> 01:52:50.894]  We want to go with the third world's feudal serf model.
[01:52:51.754 --> 01:52:52.835]  It's not a third world model.
[01:52:53.075 --> 01:52:56.776]  It's a Roman or a British empire, a colonial model.
[01:52:57.892 --> 01:53:00.473]  That Africa and Latin America and much of Asia never got out of.
[01:53:00.813 --> 01:53:02.153]  America got out for just a second!
[01:53:02.493 --> 01:53:03.534]  We're right back in the news!
[01:53:05.274 --> 01:53:07.115]  And Trump is bringing you Americana.
[01:53:08.275 --> 01:53:09.375]  That's why they hate him so bad.
[01:53:09.916 --> 01:53:13.557]  Yeah, you see Schumer all happy, delightful, oh, and the Democrats keep attacking him.
[01:53:13.597 --> 01:53:14.957]  Oh, look, base, turn away from him!
[01:53:15.317 --> 01:53:18.358]  You know, he was stuck between the Republicans and the Democrats blocking him.
[01:53:18.678 --> 01:53:20.679]  They were about to blame him for the economy imploding.
[01:53:20.999 --> 01:53:23.040]  He wasn't about to do it with the midst of these hurricanes.
[01:53:23.340 --> 01:53:27.581]  He wants that wave of exuberance to continue and prosperity to defeat them.
[01:53:29.807 --> 01:53:31.569]  Took the rays of the sun making plants grow.
[01:53:32.751 --> 01:53:34.213]  So, we'll make it through this hurricane.
[01:53:34.253 --> 01:53:35.995]  We can't make it through Islamification.
[01:53:36.295 --> 01:53:38.198]  We can't make it through sexualization of our children.
[01:53:38.458 --> 01:53:40.000]  We can't make it through globalization.
[01:53:40.440 --> 01:53:43.044]  We have to make it through being strong and focusing.
[01:53:44.195 --> 01:53:47.637]  Bound to no party, Trump upends 150 years of two-party rule.
[01:53:47.657 --> 01:53:50.298]  Even the New York Times goes, he's for real.
[01:53:50.618 --> 01:53:51.599]  He means what he's saying.
[01:53:51.919 --> 01:53:53.120]  That's why he's so dangerous.
[01:53:53.420 --> 01:53:54.661]  He's overthrown the system.
[01:53:55.001 --> 01:53:55.601]  He's horrible.
[01:53:55.661 --> 01:53:56.222]  He's scary.
[01:53:56.242 --> 01:53:56.882]  Let's get rid of him.
[01:53:57.182 --> 01:53:59.043]  They admit he keeps his promises.
[01:53:59.303 --> 01:54:00.164]  He really believes it.
[01:54:00.264 --> 01:54:01.304]  Oh my God, he's horrible.
[01:54:01.624 --> 01:54:02.405]  What are we gonna do?
[01:54:05.444 --> 01:54:18.050]  In the end, he goes on, when Donald J. Trump set his sights on the presidency in the 2000 election, he pushed the nomination of the Reform Party, a home for, this is Shannon Independence, the Republican Party has just moved too far to the right, he explained the Democrats are too far to the left.
[01:54:18.490 --> 01:54:25.513]  In the end, he dropped the campaign of the Reform Party, a leftover construct of Ross Perot, two independent presidential campaigns during the 1990s.
[01:54:25.633 --> 01:54:29.935]  It was one of the last five times that Trump would switch party affiliations over the ten years.
[01:54:30.536 --> 01:54:32.857]  I'm the Lone Ranger he once contended.
[01:54:34.335 --> 01:54:45.906]  Now in the White House, President Trump demonstrated this past week that he still imagines himself as a solitary cowboy as he abandoned Republican congressional leaders to forge a short-term fiscal deal with Democrats.
[01:54:46.586 --> 01:54:57.116]  Although elected as a Republican last year, Trump has shown in nearly eight months in office that he is in many ways the first Independent to hold the presidency since the advent of the two-party system around the time of the Civil War.
[01:54:57.156 --> 01:54:58.217]  That's right.
[01:54:58.397 --> 01:54:59.998]  Finally truth from the New York Times.
[01:55:01.115 --> 01:55:10.641]  And just get on board with the American system and prosperity and letting middle class and poor people have some jobs and futures and then you elites can still be all powerful up there.
[01:55:10.701 --> 01:55:14.083]  Just, you don't have to piss on us off your balconies because it makes you feel better.
[01:55:15.421 --> 01:55:23.007]  And we're not going to let North Korea have nuclear weapons and threaten everybody, and we're not going to roll over and move everything to China so Goldman Sachs can crap down our backs.
[01:55:23.067 --> 01:55:25.889]  I mean, they brag about mounting America's head on the wall.
[01:55:26.230 --> 01:55:32.595]  Why would you mount the engine of prosperity to the wall so that people with one-inch wee-wees would feel powerful?
[01:55:32.915 --> 01:55:37.219]  There is no point to do any of this unless you're a satanic pedophile.
[01:55:38.219 --> 01:55:42.343]  And Trump is not a devil-worshiping pot-bellied pedophile, and that's his great crime.
[01:55:42.383 --> 01:55:44.665]  Speaking of that, here is George Clooney.
[01:55:45.714 --> 01:55:58.122]  His parents, corrupt famous Hollywood dons, gave him his jobs, force fed him until he was 40 plus years old when he finally got a soap opera hit show on ER or whatever it was.
[01:55:58.562 --> 01:56:04.186]  Clooney says that Stephen Bannon is a butt licker or would lick his rear end.
[01:56:04.226 --> 01:56:05.307]  I'm sorry, this is a real quote.
[01:56:05.607 --> 01:56:06.428]  This is in the Daily Beast.
[01:56:07.268 --> 01:56:10.250]  To be successful in Hollywood and that Bannon's a loser.
[01:56:10.871 --> 01:56:12.412]  Bannon was successful in the Navy.
[01:56:12.672 --> 01:56:13.873]  He was successful in Hollywood.
[01:56:14.093 --> 01:56:15.594]  He was successful in banking.
[01:56:16.014 --> 01:56:36.768]  He then helped Trump spearhead a total come-behind victory to turn the Republic around, to turn the economy around with three-point-plus growth, and to do everything in the face of this with Infowars, the Liberty Movement, Drudge, and everybody else to give America a real shot at not being set up and bled dry by globalist vampires to build their world government.
[01:56:37.108 --> 01:56:52.523]  And you some little boy who's famous in Hollywood that they paid to have him put movies and TV shows for 30 years before he finally was on one hit TV show when he was already 40 plus years old.
[01:56:52.863 --> 01:56:59.530]  This loser baby with his mommy and daddy wiping his butt till he was 40 years old doing
[01:56:59.770 --> 01:57:03.935]  Everything for him and all he won't house any Muslims, he says, bring in.
[01:57:04.276 --> 01:57:05.457]  He pushes all his crap.
[01:57:05.638 --> 01:57:07.280]  He said Trump would never be president.
[01:57:07.540 --> 01:57:17.292]  And now he comes out to look at Stephen Bannon, a true blue collar guy that came from a family that was literally at the poverty line, but working at the shipping docks.
[01:57:17.913 --> 01:57:30.865]  I've looked into Stephen Bannon, who was a hardcore Democrat until he realized it was a lie, and then you sit there and piss in his face with your billion-dollar family, and your hundreds of millions of dollars, and your nothingness, sitting there saying he's a loser who wanted you.
[01:57:30.885 --> 01:57:34.068]  It's like when Fox said, I wanted shows with Fox and the New York Daily News.
[01:57:34.288 --> 01:57:35.650]  I turned down three shows with Fox.
[01:57:36.030 --> 01:57:36.931]  I built my own thing.
[01:57:37.032 --> 01:57:37.693]  I don't need you.
[01:57:37.713 --> 01:57:38.754]  I don't want you.
[01:57:39.034 --> 01:57:40.436]  I literally piss in your face.
[01:57:40.757 --> 01:57:41.558]  You are the losers.
[01:57:41.638 --> 01:57:42.600]  You were given everything.
[01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:43.721]  You are the scum.
[01:57:43.921 --> 01:57:45.363]  God bless all our listeners and crew.
[01:57:45.824 --> 01:57:46.966]  Rob Dews coming up more.

[01:58:03.348 --> 01:58:04.108]  How did he get in here?
[01:58:04.169 --> 01:58:06.430]  He's supposed to be with a few people outside.
[01:58:06.510 --> 01:58:14.895]  How about... How about all week they're talking about the mass of crowds that are going to be outside.
[01:58:14.995 --> 01:58:15.555]  Where am I?
[01:58:15.615 --> 01:58:16.215]  Well, it's hot out.
[01:58:16.355 --> 01:58:16.936]  It is hot.
[01:58:17.016 --> 01:58:18.917]  I think it's too warm.
[01:58:19.297 --> 01:58:28.642]  You know, they show up with the helmets and the black masks and they've got gloves and they've got everything.
