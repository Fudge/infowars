[00:00:02.489 --> 00:00:05.513]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:00:06.073 --> 00:00:10.239]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.981 --> 00:00:20.623]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Tuesday, January 17, 2017.
[00:00:23.265 --> 00:00:23.966]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:24.026 --> 00:00:30.071]  Alex Jones is going to be taking the show at the bottom of the show, but the last half hour, 1.30 Central Time.
[00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:35.295]  I've been told that he has a huge announcement concerning attacks of a lethal nature.
[00:00:35.355 --> 00:00:36.756]  That's all I know about it.
[00:00:36.856 --> 00:00:40.960]  So we're going to get that information as it breaks as Alex returns to Austin.
[00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.820]  He's on his way back.
[00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.085]  We're going to have a clip of him in the next segment telling us about what is coming up.
[00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:55.485]  We've also got interesting news today as the media has declared all-out war on Donald Trump and you've seen this of course.
[00:00:55.785 --> 00:01:06.070]  Before the election, ever since the election, they're now touting some new polls saying he is the most unpopular president elect that we've ever had since we've been doing polling.
[00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:10.533]  And of course Donald Trump reminds us all that they were wrong about every single poll
[00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:16.695]  Through the primary process, through the electoral process, they have been used as push-pulls.
[00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:19.476]  But of course, you know, I'm sure they have taken some skin off of him.
[00:01:19.516 --> 00:01:29.079]  He's had the vice chairman of his transition team say that he believes the constant attacks have had a small effect on his numbers, but that he will bounce back once we see what he does.
[00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.959]  I think that's the case.
[00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:37.742]  But clearly, it is a case of pushing against Donald Trump with every fake narrative that they can come up with.
[00:01:37.762 --> 00:01:38.722]  And we're going to talk today
[00:01:39.685 --> 00:01:43.147]  About this new BBC documentary that has come out in Panorama.
[00:01:43.847 --> 00:01:49.170]  And as some of the people in the UK are talking about it, they said, is this Panorama?
[00:01:49.271 --> 00:01:50.251]  That's the name of the program.
[00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:51.552]  Or is this Propaganda?
[00:01:52.392 --> 00:01:56.654]  And they actually called Donald Trump, the name of the documentary that they put together, is the Kremlin candidate.
[00:01:56.914 --> 00:02:02.556]  And again, I told you before that this was the new narrative that had been prepared in advance.
[00:02:02.636 --> 00:02:11.419]  It's very interesting to see how the mainstream media there and here are coordinating these attacks, coordinating the memes, coordinating the narratives.
[00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.282]  They just started last week talking about the Manchurian candidate.
[00:02:16.263 --> 00:02:23.409]  That's become the new meme to replace the fact that they continually say Donald Trump is Hitler, Donald Trump is Hitler.
[00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:32.137]  And then when he pushes back and he says, hey, national security is starting to act like a Nazi propaganda organization, leaking this fake dossier about me.
[00:02:32.177 --> 00:02:33.097]  They say, you can't say that.
[00:02:33.118 --> 00:02:34.158]  You can't call us Nazis.
[00:02:34.218 --> 00:02:36.400]  We can only, only we can call you Nazis.
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.903]  And if you call us Nazis, then that's an offense.
[00:02:40.302 --> 00:02:40.562]  To call
[00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:07.014]  Protesters are offering to pay protesters up to $2,500 a piece to agitate at the Trump inauguration.
[00:03:07.054 --> 00:03:08.495]  We got ads in two dozen cities.
[00:03:09.435 --> 00:03:15.620]  They're saying, hey, we'll pay you $50 an hour if you participate in at least six events a year.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.303]  Folks, they say we're looking for grassroots support.
[00:03:19.603 --> 00:03:22.145]  By definition, that is astroturf.
[00:03:22.486 --> 00:03:30.193]  If you're going out there with deep pockets, paying people 30 grand a year to protest, that is, you're a paid protester, that's astroturf.
[00:03:30.413 --> 00:03:31.534]  That's your job, okay?
[00:03:31.774 --> 00:03:40.703]  That's the same as if you got hired by some special interest lobbyist group to act as a, to write pieces for a think tank or something, okay?
[00:03:40.723 --> 00:03:41.804]  That's what that's truly about.
[00:03:42.324 --> 00:03:45.025]  And we're also going to have James O'Keefe joining us in the second hour.
[00:03:45.045 --> 00:03:49.006]  He's going to have part two of that Project Veritas report, the undercover report.
[00:03:49.346 --> 00:03:51.707]  We played part of that yesterday for you and we talked about that.
[00:03:52.247 --> 00:03:59.609]  They caught people talking about how they were going to infiltrate the Deplora Ball, one of the inauguration balls that was held to honor people.
[00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:01.550]  Who had voted for Donald Trump.
[00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.292]  People who voted for Donald Trump knew what was going on.
[00:04:04.352 --> 00:04:05.793]  They weren't Russian agents.
[00:04:06.093 --> 00:04:07.114]  They weren't racists.
[00:04:07.254 --> 00:04:09.015]  They weren't KKK people.
[00:04:09.055 --> 00:04:12.357]  They were just ordinary people that Hillary Clinton said are deplorable.
[00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:15.939]  So they organized a deplora ball, one of the inauguration balls.
[00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.442]  They want to infiltrate that and they want to release butyric acid.
[00:04:20.242 --> 00:04:24.286]  Which is the acid that gives human vomit its distinctive smell.
[00:04:24.326 --> 00:04:26.327]  But in concentrated forms, it's quite dangerous.
[00:04:26.387 --> 00:04:26.748]  It's an acid.
[00:04:26.788 --> 00:04:27.608]  It can burn your skin.
[00:04:28.109 --> 00:04:31.071]  It can cause burning of your lungs, that type of thing.
[00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:33.734]  So quite frankly, folks, this is a crime.
[00:04:34.614 --> 00:04:36.016]  And they're conspiring to commit a crime.
[00:04:36.036 --> 00:04:37.917]  That information has been turned over to law enforcement.
[00:04:37.937 --> 00:04:39.519]  We're going to have part two of that today.
[00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.680]  We're going to talk to James O'Keefe.
[00:04:42.201 --> 00:04:47.085]  And also Alex Jones is going to have a major revelation about attacks of a lethal nature.
[00:04:47.105 --> 00:04:47.445]  Stay with us.
[00:04:47.465 --> 00:04:47.986]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:59.804 --> 00:05:02.686]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here with the inauguration special.
[00:05:02.806 --> 00:05:06.267]  We've had some of the biggest sales in our history since Christmas into the new year.
[00:05:06.508 --> 00:05:12.491]  I'm extending them as the inauguration specials right through this weekend and then it's over.
[00:05:12.711 --> 00:05:19.174]  We have some new products coming out next week, some other sales we're going to be doing, but many of these sales are going to have to come to an end.
[00:05:19.554 --> 00:05:24.337]  If you want across the board massive specials on hundreds and hundreds of items like
[00:05:24.637 --> 00:05:27.841]  RainForce, 30% off, and they're 20% more in each bottle.
[00:05:27.901 --> 00:05:29.823]  SuperMill Vitality, 30% off.
[00:05:30.043 --> 00:05:31.625]  Survival Shield X2, 30% off.
[00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:32.406]  Here's the bottom line.
[00:05:32.426 --> 00:05:36.210]  These are great products that have changed my life and changed so many other people's lives.
[00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.172]  Also, it funds the operation.
[00:05:38.353 --> 00:05:39.334]  This sale ends
[00:05:39.554 --> 00:05:45.478]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[00:05:45.598 --> 00:05:46.939]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[00:06:08.973 --> 00:06:10.874]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[00:06:11.475 --> 00:06:17.019]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:25.605]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[00:06:25.625 --> 00:06:28.086]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[00:06:28.387 --> 00:06:32.610]  This is the best system out there, and we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:33.590]  This is how it works.
[00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:34.411]  You order.
[00:06:34.531 --> 00:06:35.331]  Customized or
[00:06:36.412 --> 00:06:37.873]  Straight from the factory, however you want it.
[00:06:38.373 --> 00:06:41.514]  It is shipped on the next business day to you and your family.
[00:06:41.834 --> 00:06:45.875]  And a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this republic.
[00:06:46.095 --> 00:06:46.876]  You cannot lose.
[00:06:46.896 --> 00:06:47.996]  You're funding the Infowar.
[00:06:48.296 --> 00:06:55.018]  You're getting the highest quality product, the most tested, the most durable, the most certified, the most believed in.
[00:06:55.359 --> 00:06:59.340]  You need to have this true piece of America ready in minutes.
[00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.781]  If you look at Bill Clinton,
[00:07:02.661 --> 00:07:03.202]  Far worse.
[00:07:03.422 --> 00:07:05.103]  Minor words and his was action.
[00:07:05.704 --> 00:07:07.225]  His was what he's done to women.
[00:07:07.265 --> 00:07:12.929]  There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:15.471]  Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:20.755]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.
[00:07:20.815 --> 00:07:22.016]  Four of them here tonight.
[00:07:22.136 --> 00:07:27.440]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:41.032]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[00:07:41.872 --> 00:07:43.332]  It's a fight for our minds.
[00:07:43.993 --> 00:07:45.933]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.
[00:07:46.253 --> 00:07:50.454]  Download our free multimedia app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:07:50.594 --> 00:07:53.955]  It's free, it's on Droid, it's on Apple, you name it.
[00:07:54.035 --> 00:07:55.636]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:07:55.816 --> 00:07:56.376]  Take action!
[00:08:16.941 --> 00:08:22.123]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.964 --> 00:08:23.864]  Move, bitch!
[00:08:24.184 --> 00:08:25.025]  Get out the way!
[00:08:27.094 --> 00:08:33.078]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag.
[00:08:33.218 --> 00:08:37.541]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[00:08:37.581 --> 00:08:41.003]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[00:08:41.143 --> 00:08:42.564]  I will not let you down.
[00:08:42.604 --> 00:08:44.745]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:08:44.906 --> 00:08:46.747]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[00:08:47.547 --> 00:08:49.389]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[00:08:49.449 --> 00:08:55.094]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[00:08:55.134 --> 00:08:57.156]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:57.476 --> 00:08:58.717]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:09:01.659 --> 00:09:08.305]  This is my final voice report before I return back to the studio in Austin later today.
[00:09:08.345 --> 00:09:09.686]  They're about to close the cabin door.
[00:09:10.887 --> 00:09:14.330]  Coming up, I'm going to break this down more in a longer report I just filed.
[00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:25.601]  It just struck me that as libertarians, as Americana promoters, we are not drama queens like the controlled domesticated left.
[00:09:26.422 --> 00:09:30.068]  Can you imagine what would happen if there was a video?
[00:09:32.029 --> 00:09:40.454]  Of Trump supporters, or libertarians, planning to attack a Democratic ball with chemical weapons.
[00:09:40.654 --> 00:09:42.215]  I mean, that's what this report is.
[00:09:42.295 --> 00:09:48.519]  It's a deadly acid pumped into the ventilation system.
[00:09:48.619 --> 00:09:54.983]  And of all places, they're meeting at David Brock's boyfriend's pizza place.
[00:09:57.038 --> 00:09:58.799]  I mean, you just can't make this stuff up.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:07.145]  And then you add to that all these other groups calling for violence and just the frothing hysteria of these people, where they've totally dehumanized us.
[00:10:08.205 --> 00:10:10.187]  And so, anything goes.
[00:10:11.267 --> 00:10:17.511]  They've had these different leftist groups like the ADL come out and say that Trump shouldn't compare the fake dossier.
[00:10:17.531 --> 00:10:18.692]  It's been proven fake now.
[00:10:20.593 --> 00:10:21.113]  To Hitler?
[00:10:21.253 --> 00:10:27.995]  I mean, what are you supposed to compare this level of fascism to now where they literally want to gas us?
[00:10:28.175 --> 00:10:30.055]  I mean, I'm going to speak at this event.
[00:10:30.115 --> 00:10:35.617]  I'm going to go there despite the threats for the First Amendment and really stand up against this.
[00:10:35.997 --> 00:10:40.298]  If you're just stepping on board, we still have plenty of seats.
[00:10:40.338 --> 00:10:42.398]  Finishing this report as they're closing the cabin door.
[00:10:44.839 --> 00:10:49.480]  I'll be back today, Lord willing, alive at 1.30 Central to break down
[00:10:51.014 --> 00:10:54.097]  The greatest attack on the press we've seen in modern history.
[00:10:54.777 --> 00:10:57.019]  It's now reached lethal levels.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.963]  It's now reached attempted murder levels.
[00:11:01.003 --> 00:11:02.104]  How you doing, sir?
[00:11:03.205 --> 00:11:06.608]  And it is imperative that
[00:11:08.131 --> 00:11:10.934]  We stand together and we stand against this intimidation.
[00:11:11.555 --> 00:11:16.440]  I mean, notice, I always say themes come out on each broadcast or in each week or each month.
[00:11:16.921 --> 00:11:20.044]  Not because I come up with themes, but because the real events in the world do.
[00:11:20.725 --> 00:11:24.229]  We've got people planning to release chemical weapons.
[00:11:25.979 --> 00:11:34.606]  And peaceful people exercising their First Amendment who've already been demonized and already called deplorable and already been turned into animals, basically.
[00:11:35.026 --> 00:11:37.028]  And that's exactly, again, what the Nazis did.
[00:11:37.629 --> 00:11:39.830]  And they do this over and over and over again.
[00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:42.132]  This is a very dangerous cult of people.
[00:11:42.773 --> 00:11:48.037]  And the Democratic Party is basing their whole system around racial systems of control.
[00:11:48.057 --> 00:11:50.999]  It's just so diabolical, it makes my head spin.
[00:11:51.159 --> 00:11:55.503]  And it's time for Democrats to decry this garbage, and it's time for Republicans to
[00:11:59.426 --> 00:12:00.467]  We're good to go.
[00:12:29.431 --> 00:12:31.212]  Alright, back to David Knight in Austin, Texas.
[00:12:32.692 --> 00:12:34.013]  And again, I'm David Knight in the studio.
[00:12:34.033 --> 00:12:35.013]  You just heard Alex Jones.
[00:12:35.033 --> 00:12:38.155]  He's going to be joining us in the studio at 1.30 Central.
[00:12:38.195 --> 00:12:40.376]  That's the last half hour of this broadcast.
[00:12:40.816 --> 00:12:47.479]  He's going to be having an announcement, a huge announcement, concerning the attacks of a lethal nature, as you just heard him talk about.
[00:12:48.124 --> 00:12:56.895]  Of course, the thing that the media is trumpeting everywhere, saying that Trump's approval polls are the lowest that they've historically seen.
[00:12:56.975 --> 00:12:59.778]  So that's the narrative that's coming out from the mainstream media.
[00:12:59.798 --> 00:13:05.165]  At the bottom of the hour, Alex is going to talk about how the Democrats are constantly attacking Donald Trump.
[00:13:06.426 --> 00:13:18.482]  I'm sure that they've taken some off of his numbers, but of course these are also the people, as Donald Trump pointed out in his tweet, he said the same people who did the phony election polls and were so wrong are now doing approval rating polls.
[00:13:18.983 --> 00:13:20.906]  They're rigged just like before.
[00:13:21.837 --> 00:13:26.199]  And we've talked about this during the election, during the run-up to the election, during the primaries.
[00:13:26.579 --> 00:13:27.579]  They're called push polls.
[00:13:28.259 --> 00:13:29.300]  You put these polls out there.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:38.523]  One of the reasons why these polls have been so wrong in terms of the election is because they were never designed to reflect public opinion.
[00:13:39.104 --> 00:13:41.905]  They were designed to influence public opinion.
[00:13:42.665 --> 00:13:51.913]  This is a very old political tactic, but it's been used far more extensively during this campaign against Donald Trump than we've ever seen before, and they're still using that campaign, quite frankly.
[00:13:52.274 --> 00:14:03.604]  And of course we had Sean Duffy, vice chair of the Trump transition team, said that he believed, and he was on CNN, he said, yeah, they've taken a little bit of numbers off of it, but it's not that bad, and we're going to see him bounce back.
[00:14:04.793 --> 00:14:06.797]  Once he takes office.
[00:14:06.877 --> 00:14:08.620]  And that's the precise point.
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:12.887]  It's one of the reasons why the media gatekeepers are being shown the door at the White House.
[00:14:13.973 --> 00:14:15.714]  And you look at the headlines about that type of thing.
[00:14:15.754 --> 00:14:19.056]  Trump team considers evicting the press from the White House.
[00:14:19.076 --> 00:14:20.277]  That's the way the Hill reports it.
[00:14:20.297 --> 00:14:25.821]  Then we've got New York Times saying Trump team considers moving the press corps, alarming reporters.
[00:14:25.861 --> 00:14:31.825]  Another salvo from the administration that has shown an unusual willingness to berate and belittle the news media.
[00:14:31.885 --> 00:14:32.866]  That's what they're talking about.
[00:14:32.906 --> 00:14:34.006]  An erosion of press freedoms.
[00:14:34.026 --> 00:14:39.830]  Did they ever complain about Barack Obama locking up their own journalists?
[00:14:40.731 --> 00:14:41.932]  Locking up whistleblowers?
[00:14:43.257 --> 00:14:49.981]  In an unprecedented amount, more than all the other presidents under the 1917, the 100-year-old act, the Espionage Act.
[00:14:50.321 --> 00:15:00.506]  In the last 100 years, Barack Obama went after whistleblowers, went after the press, coming after members of the press in an unprecedented way, doing it more than all the other presidents in the last 100 years combined.
[00:15:00.526 --> 00:15:02.167]  Did they ever say anything about that?
[00:15:02.227 --> 00:15:02.387]  No.
[00:15:02.728 --> 00:15:12.113]  Did they complain when Barack Obama came out and created the Ministry of Truth with the State Department, signing yet another NDAA Act?
[00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:21.407]  Violating the Constitution, we've seen Obama use the NDAA Act, as also the Republicans, to push in things like indefinite detention without trial by the U.S.
[00:15:21.427 --> 00:15:21.847]  military.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.661]  Being able to transport people out of this country so they can torture them without trial.
[00:15:27.161 --> 00:15:36.444]  And now creating a Ministry of Truth, funding it for $160 million for two years, $80 million a year, to let the State Department of all places be the final arbiter of truth.
[00:15:36.484 --> 00:15:40.525]  Now, Bloomberg, to their credit, finally got one of these right, whoever wrote this article here.
[00:15:40.845 --> 00:15:45.207]  Trump team may move West Wing briefings to expand capacity, and of course that's what
[00:15:46.247 --> 00:15:53.934]  The headline on Drudge pointed out about that, said, we object strenuously to any move, they said, that would shield the president and his advisors from the scrutiny.
[00:15:53.954 --> 00:15:57.417]  And of course, that is a quote from the White House Correspondents Association.
[00:15:57.437 --> 00:16:04.383]  See, what you have to understand is, this is truly kind of like a trade union, like a guild, trying to keep people out.
[00:16:04.863 --> 00:16:09.066]  And the real issue is that they're going to be bringing in talk radio hosts and bloggers.
[00:16:09.086 --> 00:16:10.388]  That's what Sean Spicer has said.
[00:16:10.628 --> 00:16:13.810]  He said, there's a lot of talk of radio and bloggers and people that can't fit in right now.
[00:16:14.491 --> 00:16:18.734]  Because they don't have a permanency because they're not part of the Washington elite media.
[00:16:19.515 --> 00:16:31.084]  And again, they have their own little guild that says we're going to decide and only these 49 people who are entitled, who are the elite entitled, are going to have access to Donald Trump and then the rest of the people are going to be shut out.
[00:16:31.124 --> 00:16:37.930]  What they're saying is we want to go to another location that's adjacent to the White House so we can get up to 400 people in there.
[00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:43.554]  They say the Brady Press Briefing Room holds 49 seats for major media organizations which are granted space
[00:16:44.375 --> 00:16:47.359]  By the White House Correspondents Association.
[00:16:47.839 --> 00:16:48.039]  See?
[00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:49.641]  It's a protectionist guild.
[00:16:50.062 --> 00:16:59.392]  And these guys are using this to create a narrative that Donald Trump is the most unpopular president that we've had, the most unpopular president-elect that we've had in recent times.
[00:16:59.452 --> 00:17:00.554]  Now today we're going to be talking to
[00:17:02.219 --> 00:17:03.880]  James O'Keefe with Project Veritas.
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.720]  Yesterday we played part one of his exposure.
[00:17:06.361 --> 00:17:14.164]  Alex referenced that in that report you just heard where they're talking about they're going to release butyric acid, which in concentrations is an acid.
[00:17:14.744 --> 00:17:19.926]  It'll burn your skin, it'll burn your lungs, but the key thing about it, they wanted to force evacuation of the entire building.
[00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:23.228]  Because it's a very disgusting smell.
[00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:29.313]  It is the ingredient in human vomit that gives human vomit its distinctive smell.
[00:17:29.453 --> 00:17:31.815]  And so that's what they wanted to do to release this place.
[00:17:31.835 --> 00:17:34.477]  But what they're talking about doing is a crime.
[00:17:34.937 --> 00:17:40.722]  And so we've got James O'Keefe on, is going to be talking to us about this investigation as the second part comes out today.
[00:17:40.742 --> 00:17:41.923]  We're going to play that for you as well.
[00:17:42.283 --> 00:17:47.387]  And now we see that there are ads in dozens of cities offering protesters up to $2,500 to agitate
[00:17:49.469 --> 00:17:50.569]  At the Trump Inaugural.
[00:17:50.589 --> 00:17:51.690]  This is from the Washington Times.
[00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:53.070]  You can see this on the Drudge Report.
[00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:55.911]  They say, Donald Trump may have a point about paid protesters.
[00:17:55.951 --> 00:17:58.132]  Jobs running ads in more than 20 cities.
[00:17:58.252 --> 00:18:04.474]  More than 20 cities offer $2,500 a month for agitators to demonstrate at inaugural events.
[00:18:05.194 --> 00:18:11.236]  Now the ad says, we are the largest private grassroots support organization in the United States.
[00:18:11.256 --> 00:18:15.918]  And I would say, if you're paying people that much money, it is AstroTurf by definition.
[00:18:16.718 --> 00:18:22.101]  They say we're currently seeking operatives to help send a strong message at upcoming inauguration protests.
[00:18:22.381 --> 00:18:28.705]  They say our standard per-event pay is $50 an hour, as long as you agree to participate in six events per year.
[00:18:29.265 --> 00:18:29.685]  How's that?
[00:18:30.086 --> 00:18:32.267]  Instead of a fight for $15, you can get $50, $5-0, $50 an hour.
[00:18:36.761 --> 00:18:37.543]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:18:38.224 --> 00:18:50.125]  Now, as I said before, Alex is going to have a report at the bottom of the hour about how the Democrats are fighting Trump, and I want you to understand how the Washington establishment, including Republicans, are fighting against Donald Trump.
[00:18:51.505 --> 00:18:57.130]  One of the things that the Washington Post points out, and I think this is very clear, we have become frustrated with the Republican Party.
[00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:06.298]  It's one of the reasons that Donald Trump succeeded, because we voted for Paul Ryan, we voted for Mitch McConnell, and the rest of them, they promised us that they would follow certain policy proposals.
[00:19:06.318 --> 00:19:10.962]  We said we want the borders patrolled, we don't want Obamacare mandates, and so forth and so on.
[00:19:10.982 --> 00:19:15.086]  We want you to cut taxes, we want you to cut spending in Washington, and they don't do it.
[00:19:15.746 --> 00:19:16.766]  The Washington Post admits that.
[00:19:16.907 --> 00:19:18.347]  I think they say this very succinctly.
[00:19:18.387 --> 00:19:21.208]  Listen to this opening statement of this article.
[00:19:21.228 --> 00:19:27.491]  They say, if Republicans appeal the Affordable Care Act, that's Obamacare, they will have achieved something rare.
[00:19:28.291 --> 00:19:39.636]  Even when conservative policy makers have complete control of government, as Republicans will in Washington once Trump assumes a presidency, they have generally failed to eliminate major social programs after these programs have been established.
[00:19:40.156 --> 00:19:43.678]  Yeah, they failed to do what they said they're going to do.
[00:19:44.639 --> 00:19:58.691]  And we're going to take a look at Paul Ryan, because he is Exhibit A. This is a guy who has opposed Trump on ethics, he has opposed him on borders, he's opposed him on Buy American, and we're also going to take a look at how John Boehner
[00:20:03.539 --> 00:20:13.084]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:20:14.124 --> 00:20:15.925]  And so I get questions all the time over the years.
[00:20:16.706 --> 00:20:22.469]  Why don't you sell body armor at InfoWarsStore.com or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:20:23.169 --> 00:20:23.809]  And it's simple.
[00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:29.513]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:20:29.953 --> 00:20:30.954]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:20:31.034 --> 00:20:33.816]  There's quality versus price.
[00:20:33.856 --> 00:20:35.777]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:20:36.377 --> 00:20:49.346]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor, has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people
[00:20:50.723 --> 00:20:52.805]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:20:53.686 --> 00:21:00.673]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:21:01.474 --> 00:21:04.257]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:21:04.277 --> 00:21:06.699]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:21:06.739 --> 00:21:10.723]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:21:11.163 --> 00:21:11.984]  Well, believe me,
[00:21:13.065 --> 00:21:15.746]  This is disruptive to tyrants worldwide.
[00:21:16.327 --> 00:21:26.732]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:21:27.392 --> 00:21:29.013]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:21:29.593 --> 00:21:31.134]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:21:31.774 --> 00:21:38.818]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:21:39.578 --> 00:21:41.940]  We've went out and did some testing.
[00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.721]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:21:44.741 --> 00:21:51.185]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible could be so strong.
[00:21:51.426 --> 00:22:04.714]  So what we did is we went out, we used different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:22:05.094 --> 00:22:05.915]  Born in Texas.
[00:22:06.255 --> 00:22:07.176]  Made in America.
[00:22:07.416 --> 00:22:10.058]  Exclusively available at InfoWareStore.com right now.
[00:22:10.138 --> 00:22:10.919]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:22:10.979 --> 00:22:11.899]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.601]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:22:13.641 --> 00:22:14.281]  It's waterproof.
[00:22:14.321 --> 00:22:14.762]  You can wear it.
[00:22:14.802 --> 00:22:15.382]  It's comfortable.
[00:22:15.442 --> 00:22:16.223]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:22:16.283 --> 00:22:18.605]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:22:19.045 --> 00:22:26.651]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:22:27.351 --> 00:22:31.014]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:22:31.034 --> 00:22:37.840]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently test it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:39.060]  What did they really say about this?
[00:22:39.101 --> 00:22:40.241]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:22:40.402 --> 00:22:43.144]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:22:44.004 --> 00:22:51.992]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're wearing these big, heavy, bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:22:52.473 --> 00:22:57.458]  So they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:22:57.598 --> 00:23:05.005]  And 90, I mean you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in official crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:23:05.046 --> 00:23:06.247]  This stops that unless it's a slug.
[00:23:06.687 --> 00:23:07.808]  I mean, that's amazing.
[00:23:07.868 --> 00:23:11.090]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:12.611]  And soon, they won't have it.
[00:23:12.971 --> 00:23:17.375]  If it's available to civilians who are not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[00:23:17.535 --> 00:23:21.618]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:23:22.398 --> 00:23:25.740]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:26.541]  People didn't believe in it.
[00:23:26.841 --> 00:23:27.862]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:23:27.922 --> 00:23:29.643]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:23:30.984 --> 00:23:33.065]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:23:36.377 --> 00:23:38.158]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:23:39.439 --> 00:23:41.340]  Again, fund the Info Ward.
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:45.382]  Get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:23:45.883 --> 00:23:47.904]  It's a win-win.
[00:23:48.244 --> 00:23:47.904]  $200.
[00:23:48.484 --> 00:23:51.426]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:23:51.526 --> 00:23:52.227]  It's amazing.
[00:24:09.924 --> 00:24:11.245]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:11.305 --> 00:24:11.985]  I'm David Knight.
[00:24:12.265 --> 00:24:14.587]  Alex is going to be joining us in the next segment.
[00:24:14.607 --> 00:24:17.888]  At the bottom of the hour, he's going to talk about the Democrat opposition to Trump.
[00:24:18.329 --> 00:24:24.112]  I'm going to talk in this segment about the Republican opposition and the leader of that Republican opposition, Paul Ryan.
[00:24:24.152 --> 00:24:32.156]  But before I get to that, I just want to remind you that our sale that began at the beginning of the year, our Make Our Bodies Great Again initiative, is ending this week with the inauguration.
[00:24:32.376 --> 00:24:37.519]  And of course, you can still go to Infowarslife.com and find discounts of anywhere from 20 to 30 percent off.
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:41.021]  We have Brain Force, 30% off.
[00:24:41.061 --> 00:24:42.742]  Super Male Vitality, 30% off.
[00:24:43.042 --> 00:24:46.043]  Survival Shield X2, nascent iodine, that's 30% off.
[00:24:46.404 --> 00:24:57.349]  And then at 20% off, we have Liver Shield, Prostagard, Knockout, our natural sleep aid, and also Secret 12, our vitamin B12 liquid formulation.
[00:24:57.389 --> 00:24:59.890]  So you'll find all of that at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:02.731]  That sale will be ending very soon.
[00:25:02.771 --> 00:25:04.392]  Also, we do have back-end stock.
[00:25:05.032 --> 00:25:05.552]  We're good to go.
[00:25:25.578 --> 00:25:26.239]  We're good to go.
[00:25:50.214 --> 00:25:51.275]  We're good to go.
[00:26:15.618 --> 00:26:25.303]  If you think of your DNA strand as a twisted shoestring, once that telomere, that cap on the end of your shoestring disappears, the DNA strands start to unravel.
[00:26:25.323 --> 00:26:29.706]  And that's one of the things that is, I guess, the timer on our lives that are there.
[00:26:29.746 --> 00:26:32.587]  But you can find all those at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:26:33.028 --> 00:26:35.449]  I talked about Paul Ryan, I just mentioned this briefly.
[00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:40.652]  In so many different ways, we've seen articles coming out at the end of the last week and through the weekend.
[00:26:41.752 --> 00:26:47.076]  With Paul Ryan saying, well, you know, I think this lobbying ban is a very dangerous proposal.
[00:26:47.216 --> 00:26:50.899]  I really don't think that we can do this lobbying ban that Donald Trump wants to do.
[00:26:50.919 --> 00:26:51.539]  What does he want to do?
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:58.105]  He wants to put a ban on people getting involved as lobbyists for five years.
[00:26:58.165 --> 00:27:00.787]  Move it from one year to five years, I believe is what it is.
[00:27:00.827 --> 00:27:04.750]  He's going to lengthen it and he's going to put a lifetime ban on lobbying for foreign governments.
[00:27:06.051 --> 00:27:07.272]  And now,
[00:27:08.827 --> 00:27:10.108]  Paul Ryan is saying that's dangerous.
[00:27:10.148 --> 00:27:12.068]  Here's a good example of this, okay?
[00:27:12.729 --> 00:27:16.050]  As they oppose Donald Trump, it looks like they may oppose him on Buy American.
[00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:20.271]  That's been one of the focuses of the Trump campaign.
[00:27:20.871 --> 00:27:31.875]  And as The Hill pointed out, last year, when they had a water infrastructure bill come up, it had a Buy American clause in there, and Paul Ryan led the opposition to get that stripped out.
[00:27:32.136 --> 00:27:33.216]  Why was it stripped out?
[00:27:33.276 --> 00:27:34.877]  Well, former Speaker Boehner
[00:27:36.795 --> 00:27:41.297]  Had left in October, and this bill had come up five months later, in March.
[00:27:41.957 --> 00:27:42.757]  And what did Boehner do?
[00:27:43.877 --> 00:27:51.200]  They worked, actually had foreign steel companies that tapped the lobbying firm that Boehner went to work for after he was Speaker of the House.
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:57.242]  So you got foreign steel companies going to a lobbying firm that employs John Boehner.
[00:27:58.522 --> 00:27:59.924]  And some of these are, guess what?
[00:28:00.064 --> 00:28:06.089]  A major Russian steel company came in and said, you know, we don't like that Buy American provision in there.
[00:28:06.129 --> 00:28:07.571]  Now they've got some facilities in the U.S.
[00:28:07.591 --> 00:28:13.256]  There's also a company called California Steel Industries that's owned by Japanese and Brazilian companies.
[00:28:13.676 --> 00:28:15.098]  Japanese steel company owns them.
[00:28:15.478 --> 00:28:20.062]  They hired the firm that John Boehner is with to take out the Buy American clause.
[00:28:21.075 --> 00:28:22.496]  Now, this is a couple of different issues.
[00:28:22.616 --> 00:28:26.017]  One of them is, do we really want the federal government building our infrastructure?
[00:28:26.037 --> 00:28:27.838]  I think that's a bad idea in the first place.
[00:28:28.718 --> 00:28:37.881]  But the other part of this shows how there is a revolving door between those who are power brokers going out and becoming lobbyists.
[00:28:37.901 --> 00:28:41.643]  And we have seen this from all of these former speakers, both Democrat and Republican.
[00:28:41.683 --> 00:28:46.325]  That's why it is so important to have some, to increase this
[00:28:47.879 --> 00:28:51.342]  So that you extend it from a one-year ban to a five-year ban.
[00:28:52.363 --> 00:28:57.907]  See, Paul Ryan says that's very dangerous because it would affect people like John Boehner who put him in power.
[00:28:58.407 --> 00:29:05.052]  Because John Boehner was already involved, his firm was already shutting down things immediately afterwards.
[00:29:05.693 --> 00:29:06.894]  And we also have
[00:29:07.751 --> 00:29:14.055]  As the press, we talked about the press coming after Donald Trump and saying, you know, look at these popularity polls.
[00:29:14.556 --> 00:29:16.157]  They're the lowest we've had for a president-elect.
[00:29:16.717 --> 00:29:19.759]  The way they spin the information that comes out.
[00:29:19.779 --> 00:29:26.664]  Of course, one of the other things that Paul Ryan did, and he was picked by the elitist to be the running mate for Mitt Romney.
[00:29:26.684 --> 00:29:29.005]  I'm sure he's looking at a presidential run in the future.
[00:29:29.626 --> 00:29:31.367]  And he is grooming himself for that.
[00:29:31.407 --> 00:29:32.628]  And we have the Washington Post saying,
[00:29:38.231 --> 00:29:43.614]  Because he comes after the idea that we should have borders, that we should have immigration laws.
[00:29:43.634 --> 00:29:45.295]  Stay with us, Alex Jones will be right back.
[00:29:48.477 --> 00:29:51.459]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.399 --> 00:29:55.081]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.152 --> 00:30:03.076]  Nobody loves Barack Obama more than Barack Obama.
[00:30:14.451 --> 00:30:18.552]  Hillary Clinton in Philadelphia last year, he referred to himself 137 times.
[00:30:18.772 --> 00:30:26.314]  After the police shooting in Dallas, Obama delivered an address in which he referred to himself 45 times, not once referencing himself as one to blame.
[00:30:26.555 --> 00:30:30.896]  After a mass shooting in Oregon, in a 12-minute speech, he referenced himself 28 times.
[00:30:31.116 --> 00:30:35.737]  At the Democratic National Convention, Obama referred to himself a whopping 119 times.
[00:30:35.877 --> 00:30:38.178]  Some attendees were confused and thought he was running again.
[00:30:38.358 --> 00:30:40.859]  When speaking in India last year, he referred to himself 118 times.
[00:30:42.259 --> 00:30:43.660]  It's an international love fest.
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:48.984]  In a speech on jobs in Ohio in 2010, Barack referenced himself 132 times.
[00:30:49.364 --> 00:30:53.668]  But I want you to understand, this is not about me.
[00:30:53.888 --> 00:30:56.890]  And every morning he eats a bowl of Berrios to start his day.
[00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:59.252]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[00:31:00.212 --> 00:31:06.377]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[00:31:06.957 --> 00:31:08.338]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[00:31:09.229 --> 00:31:11.091]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[00:31:11.731 --> 00:31:17.296]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[00:31:17.876 --> 00:31:25.862]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[00:31:25.883 --> 00:31:28.344]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[00:31:28.625 --> 00:31:29.826]  This is the best system out there.
[00:31:30.086 --> 00:31:32.848]  And we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[00:31:33.108 --> 00:31:33.849]  This is how it works.
[00:31:34.149 --> 00:31:34.670]  You order.
[00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:35.570]  Customized or
[00:31:36.671 --> 00:31:38.132]  Straight from the factory, however you want it.
[00:31:38.613 --> 00:31:41.775]  It is shipped on the next business day to you and your family.
[00:31:42.075 --> 00:31:46.118]  And a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this republic.
[00:31:46.339 --> 00:31:47.119]  You cannot lose.
[00:31:47.159 --> 00:31:48.260]  You're funding the Infowar.
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:55.305]  You're getting the highest quality product, the most tested, the most durable, the most certified, the most believed in.
[00:31:55.646 --> 00:31:59.589]  You need to have this true piece of America ready in minutes.
[00:32:00.029 --> 00:32:06.174]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[00:32:06.575 --> 00:32:09.457]  Dr. Grip, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[00:32:09.797 --> 00:32:15.002]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[00:32:15.422 --> 00:32:21.407]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[00:32:21.527 --> 00:32:24.670]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:26.271]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[00:32:26.451 --> 00:32:30.595]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[00:32:30.795 --> 00:32:33.657]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[00:32:33.737 --> 00:32:35.319]  It works like an antioxidant.
[00:32:35.399 --> 00:32:38.582]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[00:32:38.882 --> 00:32:41.204]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[00:32:41.484 --> 00:32:42.425]  It's in powder form.
[00:32:42.525 --> 00:32:45.247]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[00:32:45.408 --> 00:32:46.008]  I take this.
[00:32:46.128 --> 00:32:47.810]  This is the product that I take.
[00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:49.912]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[00:32:50.732 --> 00:32:51.493]  We fight the Globals.
[00:32:51.533 --> 00:32:52.353]  We fight the New World Order.

[00:32:58.377 --> 00:33:16.067]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:26.227 --> 00:33:39.283]  If we find out that somebody on behalf of Donald Trump was on the phone or in email relations with somebody in Russia, or the ambassador to America from Russia, and there was some sort of, as you call it, collusion, then what?
[00:33:39.383 --> 00:33:41.786]  Does that make Trump subject to impeachment?
[00:33:41.826 --> 00:33:43.208]  What do you mean by not legitimate?
[00:33:43.568 --> 00:33:45.090]  Just generally what do you mean by the term?
[00:33:45.791 --> 00:33:49.154]  If you find out there was a connection, there was collusion, your turn.
[00:33:49.715 --> 00:33:51.657]  Well, here's what I'm trying to get to.
[00:33:51.917 --> 00:34:09.294]  If we discover that Donald Trump or his advocates played a role in helping to devise strategy, if they're the ones who came up with crooked Hillary, if they're the ones who came up with she's ill, something's wrong with her energy, and the way that he
[00:34:09.934 --> 00:34:12.616]  Basically, you know, described her in the campaign.
[00:34:13.136 --> 00:34:19.919]  I think that is something that would put the question squarely on the table whether or not he should be impeached.
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:24.422]  So you think you could have an impeachable offense before you take office, in other words?
[00:34:24.982 --> 00:34:30.625]  Well, I think that at the point that investigations discover
[00:34:31.505 --> 00:34:50.320]  And can confirm and document any of that, that they had a role in helping to strategize, they had a role in attempting to determine the outcome, that in many ways they used the information that they got from the DNC when they hacked into our emails, etc.
[00:34:50.681 --> 00:34:55.385]  If that was used against Hillary Clinton in some ways, yes, I think that's impeachable.
[00:34:55.405 --> 00:34:59.088]  You're saying you're looking for an economic message that speaks to the needs
[00:34:59.788 --> 00:35:00.068]  Barack Obama
[00:35:26.493 --> 00:35:32.015]  He called for so many fixes to Obamacare.
[00:35:32.476 --> 00:35:36.257]  You understand what Republicans did when that man was first inaugurated.
[00:35:36.297 --> 00:35:38.458]  They said on day one they were going to obstruct.
[00:35:38.918 --> 00:35:41.119]  And they successfully did in many ways.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.621]  He and the administration were very clear, there are lots of things...
[00:35:45.555 --> 00:35:46.715]  It's still fixed with health care.
[00:35:47.015 --> 00:35:48.076]  There are lots of problems.
[00:35:48.096 --> 00:35:50.716]  What about re-importing drugs from Canada?
[00:35:50.816 --> 00:36:05.299]  If you don't have somebody in Congress, if you don't have any leadership on the other side who understands they need to put the American people first instead of trying to destroy government because they didn't like Barack Obama, that is what is wrong.
[00:36:05.779 --> 00:36:08.000]  That is what keeps people disenfranchised.
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:12.601]  I don't want to re-litigate it, but if you're going to generalizations that aren't true, Democrats held
[00:36:13.301 --> 00:36:16.504]  All three branches of government when Obama came into office?
[00:36:16.524 --> 00:36:17.845]  Look, I'm not just asking.
[00:36:18.065 --> 00:36:19.286]  Here you have Donald Trump.
[00:36:19.326 --> 00:36:20.687]  That's transparently false.
[00:36:20.727 --> 00:36:21.848]  Here you have Donald Trump.
[00:36:21.868 --> 00:36:31.696]  The obstruction that the Republican Party did to fixing Obamacare, to making sure that we could continue to get healthcare in this country better, was abysmal.
[00:36:31.976 --> 00:36:32.736]  Do you know what it is?
[00:36:32.837 --> 00:36:34.118]  If you deny it, that's on you.
[00:36:34.198 --> 00:36:36.099]  You and your therapist can talk about that.
[00:36:39.224 --> 00:36:44.968]  I'm not denying that Republicans tried to stop Barack Obama's agenda, and sometimes it was justified, and others it wasn't.
[00:36:45.008 --> 00:36:49.170]  But I'm asking you a very specific question.
[00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:55.574]  And I'm asking you, do you agree with Donald Trump's plan to re-import drugs at a lower price
[00:36:55.854 --> 00:37:00.120]  I haven't seen the exact plan you're talking about, so I'm not going to play this gotcha game.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.301]  I'm not going to sit here and cheerlead.
[00:37:13.977 --> 00:37:20.704]  ...is refusing to even celebrate Martin Luther King Day and understand that he is... Why do you always bring it back to race?
[00:37:20.764 --> 00:37:21.525]  I'm asking you about economics.
[00:37:21.545 --> 00:37:23.127]  That's where this segment started, Tucker.
[00:37:23.147 --> 00:37:24.488]  You're the one who picked the topic.
[00:37:24.609 --> 00:37:24.969]  I didn't.
[00:37:25.009 --> 00:37:26.450]  I'm asking you about health care.
[00:37:26.551 --> 00:37:28.753]  I'm asking you about lowering drug prices.
[00:37:28.813 --> 00:37:30.735]  And Trump, look, I'm not endorsing everything Trump does.
[00:37:30.795 --> 00:37:35.060]  I'm just saying, here he's doing something that overlaps with what Democrats have wanted to do for a long time.
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:36.221]  Decades.
[00:37:36.701 --> 00:37:37.862]  And he's saying, yeah, let's do it.
[00:37:38.222 --> 00:37:39.823]  And I'm asking you, are you for it or not?
[00:37:39.883 --> 00:37:42.825]  Are you so partisan that you get to say, yeah, I don't like Trump, but that's a good idea?
[00:37:43.206 --> 00:37:44.727]  But you can't.
[00:37:44.767 --> 00:37:54.634]  Maxine Waters, the California Congresswoman, went on CNBC with Chris Matthews last night to call for Trump's impeachment.
[00:37:56.175 --> 00:38:00.379]  She's now saying that, with no evidence or no facts, that the term crooked Hillary
[00:38:01.702 --> 00:38:05.381]  Came from the Russians and that the Russians were actually in command
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:08.820]  Love Trump, telling him everything to say.
[00:38:09.341 --> 00:38:12.821]  Now anybody that knows Trump or anybody that's studied Trump knows this is the biggest joke on the planet.
[00:38:13.241 --> 00:38:15.942]  The only person in control of Donald Trump is Donald Trump.
[00:38:16.522 --> 00:38:21.803]  We also have the lady who is in the running to be the new DNC chair, I guess Ms.
[00:38:21.883 --> 00:38:25.284]  Green, going on Tucker Carlson last night.
[00:38:25.904 --> 00:38:31.965]  And when Carlson would bring up issues like Trump's plan to cut prescription drug costs, not with a good
[00:38:33.592 --> 00:38:33.632]  No.
[00:38:51.426 --> 00:38:54.269]  They just go back to race on every, every issue.
[00:38:55.089 --> 00:39:00.174]  But because the public isn't buying that anymore, they've now moved on to say that he's a Russian agent.
[00:39:00.714 --> 00:39:08.961]  And they've gone from saying that they just kind of influenced the election, to now claiming that they're actually telling him what to say.
[00:39:09.602 --> 00:39:10.722]  So it doesn't work anymore.
[00:39:11.423 --> 00:39:11.563]  Yeah.
[00:39:31.718 --> 00:39:34.239]  NBC source, and it looks credible.
[00:39:34.759 --> 00:39:35.939]  I'm not saying the report's credible.
[00:39:35.979 --> 00:39:38.800]  I'm saying that the source, it looks like, is at NBC.
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:40.841]  We have quite a few sources.
[00:39:40.881 --> 00:39:41.581]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:39:42.461 --> 00:39:59.526]  But they're saying that there is a tape compilation going back over the 14 seasons or whatever of The Apprentice with him sitting in the chair saying things like his son's retarded and making dirty jokes.
[00:40:00.808 --> 00:40:01.949]  And supposedly the N-word.
[00:40:01.969 --> 00:40:12.434]  You know, the thing about Trump, whether this is true or not, is the type of people that have known him for a long time, is he does like to basically tell dirty jokes, anything that a comedian would do.
[00:40:13.135 --> 00:40:24.101]  And he doesn't do it that often, but almost like a stress reliever, or a way to break the ice, he will sit there and a lot of times actually deprecate himself as well.
[00:40:24.741 --> 00:40:28.063]  You know, call himself retarded, call himself names.
[00:40:29.183 --> 00:40:37.131]  I'm not defending any of this, but we've all known high-powered people that have to focus all the time, that sometimes when they're letting off steam, act pretty stupid.
[00:40:37.971 --> 00:40:44.717]  I don't personally do it in those ways, but I do act silly sometimes, but I'm not even getting into all of that.
[00:40:45.318 --> 00:40:52.865]  The point is, is that they would have already released this tape if it was real previously during the election.
[00:40:54.085 --> 00:41:05.698]  If it is, quote, real, the word is, it's so heavily edited with jump cuts that it's just like when people take stuff I've said and edit it together and take it out of context.
[00:41:06.679 --> 00:41:15.568]  Now, if he did ever use the N-word, even in any context, it's not right because people can then use it and basically twist it.
[00:41:18.297 --> 00:41:19.577]  It's used as a power word.
[00:41:20.378 --> 00:41:23.439]  But frankly, growing up, where I heard it used was by black folks.
[00:41:23.959 --> 00:41:29.901]  I was always offended by it personally, just because I was basically brought up dead.
[00:41:30.661 --> 00:41:33.903]  Putting people down for what group they're part of is what losers do.
[00:41:34.723 --> 00:41:40.105]  But regardless of that, Trump is trying to cut the taxes.
[00:41:40.405 --> 00:41:41.885]  He's trying to bring jobs back.
[00:41:41.925 --> 00:41:43.626]  He's already bringing jobs back to Detroit.
[00:41:44.046 --> 00:41:44.626]  Who does that help?
[00:41:44.686 --> 00:41:46.547]  It helps everybody, particularly it helps black people.
[00:41:47.403 --> 00:41:49.084]  Trump's trying to cut prescription drug costs.
[00:41:49.824 --> 00:41:52.006]  Trump's already bringing back hundreds of billions of dollars in jobs.
[00:41:52.446 --> 00:41:54.627]  Trump is actually focusing on these communities.
[00:41:55.107 --> 00:41:59.750]  See, Obama didn't care because he knew he had the black communities.
[00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:10.816]  With Trump, he's actually trying to work to go out and empower these communities and actually deliver and actually take these communities away from the Democratic Party by making them prosperous and successful.
[00:42:11.116 --> 00:42:12.597]  That's Stephen Bannon's plan.
[00:42:13.017 --> 00:42:13.838]  That's Trump's plan.
[00:42:14.138 --> 00:42:15.039]  That's the real plan.
[00:42:15.879 --> 00:42:25.261]  And that's why the media is invoking race so much, is because they want that to be the new national identity.
[00:42:25.982 --> 00:42:30.423]  They want that to be what you have as a pastime, as obsessing over what color you are.
[00:42:30.903 --> 00:42:37.884]  Which on Martin Luther King Day, we should have all asked ourselves, how have we turned things upside down?
[00:42:38.285 --> 00:42:43.906]  The very people who claim they love Martin Luther King all day in the controlled media, they're the very ones.
[00:42:44.966 --> 00:42:54.630]  That are doing the opposite of what he said, where he said we should be in a colorblind society and judge people off of the character of their deeds and what they actually stand for, not off of what group they're in.
[00:42:55.151 --> 00:42:57.132]  So this is clear divide and conquer.
[00:42:57.652 --> 00:43:01.193]  And again, this nation is majority-minority in most areas.
[00:43:01.253 --> 00:43:08.457]  It'll soon be 100%, you know, in every state that the minorities are the quote majority.
[00:43:09.017 --> 00:43:11.438]  Okay, it'll soon be in every state, all 50.
[00:43:12.338 --> 00:43:13.279]  They don't want you.
[00:43:14.192 --> 00:43:14.352]  Yes.
[00:43:38.632 --> 00:43:44.534]  This is part of a concerted effort, and I've been telling you it was coming, that in the days leading up to Trump's inauguration.
[00:43:45.336 --> 00:43:48.377]  That we would hear about all this supposed new dirt that was about to come out.
[00:43:48.677 --> 00:43:50.418]  That we would hear for calls for impeachment.
[00:43:50.858 --> 00:43:52.139]  And now you're seeing it happen.
[00:43:52.679 --> 00:44:00.662]  And then you see all the massive funding for the race-based groups like Black Lives Matter and other Soros groups converging on D.C.
[00:44:01.303 --> 00:44:03.063]  And people meeting in D.C.
[00:44:03.123 --> 00:44:11.167]  restaurants and being caught on tape openly talking about putting acid gas into air conditioning systems and assaulting people.
[00:44:11.987 --> 00:44:18.970]  This is all part of the preparation for a triggering event that's going to be race-based in the next few days.
[00:44:19.411 --> 00:44:22.292]  And it could be this NBC tape, edited, made up.
[00:44:22.952 --> 00:44:23.332]  Who knows?
[00:44:23.412 --> 00:44:29.675]  I mean, look, I went and saw Star Wars, the new movie, Rogue One.
[00:44:30.536 --> 00:44:31.936]  And Princess Leia was back in it.
[00:44:32.396 --> 00:44:33.697]  Governor Tarkin was back in it.
[00:44:34.397 --> 00:44:39.880]  They're coming out, reportedly, with movies with John Wayne, where he returns and basically stars the whole movie himself.
[00:44:40.979 --> 00:44:43.140]  They can edit and do whatever they want.
[00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:44.581]  I'm not saying that's happening here.
[00:44:45.342 --> 00:44:47.843]  I'm saying they would have already released this if it was so damning.
[00:44:48.484 --> 00:45:00.451]  And the word is, not from our source, but from others that have talked about this supposed tape, is again, it's second long edited together jump cuts that they're scared to release because they know it's edited out of context.
[00:45:00.972 --> 00:45:02.133]  But let's just move on from that.
[00:45:03.854 --> 00:45:04.194]  Trump
[00:45:05.609 --> 00:45:31.310]  If this comes out, and they've twisted it, or they're demonizing him, needs to just own the whole deal, and say that people sit around, they joke around, they try to be shocking, you know, it's wrong that he did it, but that he was already making up for things like that, and things that have happened in the past, that other people have done that's wrong, by really trying to focus on truly empowering all the communities in this country, and bringing people together.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:45.387]  Then he should come out and talk about the fact that 51% of black people or more on average never get out of the womb in this country and that we should work to make sure that that genocide created by Margaret Sanger and pushed by the leftists is stopped.
[00:45:45.807 --> 00:45:47.348]  And then he should go on a tour.
[00:45:48.806 --> 00:45:49.206]  I think
[00:46:11.539 --> 00:46:11.979]  I don't know.
[00:46:30.576 --> 00:46:34.298]  What about all the horrible things Obama's done funding the Muslim Brotherhood?
[00:46:34.818 --> 00:46:38.479]  What about all the major wars they've been fighting as he's trying to start a war with Russia?
[00:46:39.099 --> 00:46:47.403]  What about all the genetic engineering and the GMO and the glyphosates that have caused hundreds of millions of women worldwide to reportedly get breast cancer?
[00:46:48.383 --> 00:46:49.985]  These are the real holocausts that are going on.
[00:46:50.545 --> 00:46:59.974]  And instead, all we ever obsess over is what the media tells us to get obsessed over and these big faux issues they bring up that we're all completely sick and tired of.
[00:47:00.855 --> 00:47:06.760]  But quite frankly, I can say that I've never done anything consciously
[00:47:07.919 --> 00:47:08.359]  Racist.
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:21.630]  In fact, I am so sick and tired of having every major issue out there basically poison this cornucopia of disinformation.
[00:47:22.674 --> 00:47:24.535]  And we're all under attack.
[00:47:25.275 --> 00:47:26.875]  That's what I'm trying to get across to people.
[00:47:26.975 --> 00:47:29.576]  Does that mean that there aren't racist white people?
[00:47:29.596 --> 00:47:30.076]  Absolutely.
[00:47:30.096 --> 00:47:31.057]  So there aren't racist white people?
[00:47:31.097 --> 00:47:31.537]  Absolutely.
[00:47:31.977 --> 00:47:38.739]  But the point is, at the end of the day, we're all being manipulated against each other by the globalists who are scientific about this.
[00:47:38.799 --> 00:47:43.800]  And that is the ultimate anti-human agenda being carried out by these psychopaths.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:45.781]  And it is a billion times bigger.
[00:47:51.492 --> 00:47:52.334]  That's what I'm getting at.
[00:47:52.734 --> 00:47:56.881]  So I'm not here as an apologist for this tape that may exist or may not exist.
[00:47:56.901 --> 00:47:58.584]  I think it probably doesn't or it's totally edited.
[00:47:58.604 --> 00:47:59.846]  They would have released it already as I said.
[00:48:01.149 --> 00:48:04.134]  I'm only raising this as an example.
[00:48:06.809 --> 00:48:26.827]  And how we get distracted like a bull with a red cape, getting distracted by all these side issues by the big globalist media that we know is the enemy, that we know is lying to us, that we know is constantly playing us off against each other and lying to the public and getting us into these giant wars to bring down other sovereign nations and put radical jihadists in control.
[00:48:27.308 --> 00:48:28.989]  We know the New World Order is the enemy.
[00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:45.939]  And now they're openly trying to overturn the people's will with Trump, and building towards something completely organized, where we can't even get prescription drug costs cut because racism is invoked, even though it doesn't even make sense to invoke it.
[00:48:46.519 --> 00:48:53.964]  Or, if John Lewis comes out and criticizes Trump, calling him a Russian spy, and Trump says, hey, that's not very nice, why don't you work with me?
[00:48:54.604 --> 00:48:55.805]  They turn that into racism.
[00:48:57.043 --> 00:49:02.025]  Criticizing someone who's criticized you on that issue is not racism.
[00:49:02.685 --> 00:49:10.648]  But again, this is an assault on logic, an assault on common sense, and we all just have to stop letting it have such power over us.
[00:49:10.708 --> 00:49:17.971]  That's the real control of racism, is the fact that it makes everybody paranoid about each other, and makes everybody act weird and be uncomfortable.
[00:49:18.451 --> 00:49:20.612]  The real issue in this country isn't even what I'd call racism.
[00:49:21.292 --> 00:49:23.273]  It's the fact that we've all been made uncomfortable.
[00:49:23.894 --> 00:49:27.115]  And now all this balkanization is worse than at any time in my life.
[00:49:27.836 --> 00:49:35.961]  It's very, very sad because we're all being targeted with the glyphosates and the fluoride and the GMOs and the electromagnetic radiation, all this other crap.
[00:49:36.901 --> 00:49:41.024]  And then meanwhile, if we don't come together, we have no chance of ever coming out of this.
[00:49:41.084 --> 00:49:44.345]  Now, coming up today, I'm going to be back in studio.
[00:49:44.706 --> 00:49:46.927]  At the time you're hearing this, I'm landing in Austin, Texas.
[00:49:48.108 --> 00:49:50.469]  And we're going to have a huge announcement at one
[00:49:52.113 --> 00:49:52.613]  Leave it at that.
[00:49:52.633 --> 00:50:03.758]  I'm not going to even tell you who's coming up or what we're going to be breaking down other than the fact that the press is now being targeted and high-level supporters and boosters of Trump are being targeted for death.
[00:50:04.578 --> 00:50:04.858]  Okay?
[00:50:05.578 --> 00:50:10.060]  So, again, I've been on a work occasion.
[00:50:10.701 --> 00:50:14.282]  I am now back, and I'm going to be going to D.C.
[00:50:14.362 --> 00:50:19.004]  tomorrow, and I'm going to be in the middle of that, so please pray for us, and please pray for this country.
[00:50:21.801 --> 00:50:23.122]  Soros admits he's flooding D.C.
[00:50:23.142 --> 00:50:27.783]  with his operatives, so it's going to be extremely dangerous obviously, but this is something we've got to do.
[00:50:27.803 --> 00:50:30.564]  And I want to commend everybody that is coming to D.C.
[00:50:30.865 --> 00:50:32.985]  to stand up for the First Amendment in our electoral process.
[00:50:33.826 --> 00:50:36.046]  Now, back to David Knight in Austin, Texas.
[00:50:36.106 --> 00:50:37.507]  I'm Alex Jones, Infowars.com.
[00:51:08.692 --> 00:51:17.294]  If there's private information that someone is blackmailing a public figure, and the public figure or someone takes it to the intelligence agencies, you would think it would be private.
[00:51:17.755 --> 00:51:21.536]  And really, this is so important that I think whoever leaked it should be prosecuted.
[00:51:21.876 --> 00:51:22.896]  Someone should go to jail.
[00:51:23.456 --> 00:51:26.797]  If this was an intelligence agency had to talk to the media, they should go to jail.
[00:51:27.217 --> 00:51:29.958]  If this was part of the Obama administration, they should go to jail.
[00:51:30.058 --> 00:51:33.439]  Alright, that's an interesting point that Rand Paul makes as he's talking to Neil Cavuto.
[00:51:33.479 --> 00:51:35.239]  Joining us now is Lionel.
[00:51:35.259 --> 00:51:37.100]  Lionel, what is your take on that?
[00:51:38.208 --> 00:51:38.809]  Fascinating.
[00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:44.074]  It is fascinating how this started.
[00:51:44.414 --> 00:51:47.077]  David, where do we begin?
[00:51:47.738 --> 00:51:51.081]  I thought that it couldn't get any more complicated before.
[00:51:51.782 --> 00:51:56.547]  Bill Clinton, I thought, my God, look at the media there after Bill Clinton and the right wing and the left wing.
[00:51:56.567 --> 00:51:57.207]  It was very simple.
[00:51:57.287 --> 00:51:58.989]  Right wing, left wing media.
[00:51:59.890 --> 00:52:01.092]  Right-wing, left-wing media.
[00:52:01.392 --> 00:52:06.077]  And the media was sometimes vacillate or be somehow maybe a little bit skewed one way or the other.
[00:52:06.618 --> 00:52:16.109]  Now we have left-wing, right-wing, alt-left, alt-right, media, fake news media, various internet platform media, controlled media.
[00:52:16.589 --> 00:52:17.791]  Then you have Donald Trump.
[00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:25.673]  Who completely upset the apple cart and poses an existential threat to everyone.
[00:52:26.374 --> 00:52:37.880]  And so consequently, he is going to be the beneficiary of this frisson, this calamity, this complete unraveling of everyone.
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:41.922]  He can just sit back, say nothing, and watch
[00:52:42.982 --> 00:52:43.763]  What has happened?
[00:52:43.964 --> 00:52:44.805]  Rand Paul.
[00:52:45.426 --> 00:52:47.909]  Rand Paul is, he makes a lot of sense.
[00:52:48.590 --> 00:52:49.171]  I think.
[00:52:50.112 --> 00:52:56.821]  What I used to think makes sense, makes sense, but Trump intel leakers should go to jail.
[00:52:57.522 --> 00:52:57.882]  First.
[00:52:59.023 --> 00:53:04.327]  Let us stop with this idea, this fetish, David, that we have about putting people in prison and in jail.
[00:53:04.767 --> 00:53:05.728]  Let's just stop this.
[00:53:06.268 --> 00:53:17.275]  When you allow this trope or meme to be suggested that whistleblowers, or excuse me, that people who leak should go to jail, that poses a very, very serious threat.
[00:53:17.295 --> 00:53:22.699]  So the first reaction to all First Amendment scholars and lovers of liberty should be, wait a minute, stop.
[00:53:22.719 --> 00:53:24.760]  Barack Obama with using the 100-year-old 1917 Espionage Act
[00:53:28.803 --> 00:53:33.464]  He put more journalists and whistleblowers in than all the other presidents in the last 100 years combined.
[00:53:33.584 --> 00:53:34.644]  He put them into jail.
[00:53:34.684 --> 00:53:37.345]  So there's been a lot of move against whistleblowers.
[00:53:37.905 --> 00:53:43.826]  And I think the interesting thing in defense of Rand Paul, when people said, oh, we got to put Snowden in jail.
[00:53:43.906 --> 00:53:47.207]  We've got to put WikiLeaks and Julian Assange in jail.
[00:53:47.227 --> 00:53:48.087]  He said, all right, fine.
[00:53:48.107 --> 00:53:50.228]  You want to put them in jail for releasing that information?
[00:53:50.248 --> 00:53:50.628]  Then fine.
[00:53:50.668 --> 00:53:56.629]  You put the people in the NSA, whose crimes they exposed, put them in jail as well, OK?
[00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:07.466]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:07.486 --> 00:54:11.390]  I'm David Knight in studio, January the 17th, 2017.
[00:54:18.917 --> 00:54:22.919]  As you just heard, Alex Jones is going to be coming in at the last half hour of the show.
[00:54:22.939 --> 00:54:27.040]  He has a huge announcement concerning attacks of a lethal nature.
[00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:31.382]  That's all I know about it, so you'll be able to hear that as it's introduced.
[00:54:31.442 --> 00:54:36.324]  So it's something that he's kept quite close to the chest, but he's going to be breaking that
[00:54:37.330 --> 00:54:38.570]  At the bottom of the show.
[00:54:39.311 --> 00:54:53.575]  Before I get back to the news, I just want to remind you that our special Make Our Bodies Great Again, our 2017 initiative to improve your health, help you to do that by offering some discounts on some of the best sellers that we have at InfoWars Life is about to end.
[00:54:53.595 --> 00:54:55.116]  It's going to end this week.
[00:54:55.416 --> 00:54:57.497]  It's going to end with the inauguration at the end of the week.
[00:54:58.917 --> 00:55:06.100]  We have Brain Force 30% off, Super Male Vitality 30% off, Survival Shield X2, that's our nascent iodine, that's 30% off.
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:10.001]  Also, Secret 12, our vitamin B12 formulation, that's 20% off.
[00:55:10.441 --> 00:55:16.864]  Liver Shield, Knockout, and Prostagard, all 20% off as well at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:55:16.884 --> 00:55:19.544]  So see discounts there from 20 to 30% off.
[00:55:19.885 --> 00:55:22.766]  And again, these sales will be ending at the end of the week.
[00:55:24.086 --> 00:55:26.167]  I was talking about the opposition
[00:55:27.273 --> 00:55:30.316]  Donald Trump is coming from Paul Ryan, for example.
[00:55:31.477 --> 00:55:46.532]  He has proposed as an ethics rule that, and this would just be executive branch officials, this is not what the House of Representatives or Senate would do, but that executive branch officials, people working for him,
[00:55:47.418 --> 00:55:50.082]  Would not be able to become lobbyists for five years.
[00:55:50.182 --> 00:55:52.845]  Currently, right now, they have a ban in place of one year.
[00:55:52.946 --> 00:55:54.708]  So he would extend that from one year to five years.
[00:55:55.449 --> 00:55:58.213]  He would also say, if you're going to come in and work in my cabinet,
[00:55:59.042 --> 00:56:04.845]  As a senior executive official, you're not ever going to be able to lobby on the behalf of a foreign government.
[00:56:05.705 --> 00:56:07.546]  And Paul Ryan thinks that's a dangerous idea.
[00:56:07.566 --> 00:56:08.787]  A dangerous idea.
[00:56:08.807 --> 00:56:11.908]  I mean, we've just seen the situation.
[00:56:11.968 --> 00:56:15.169]  I reported that just before we went to the bottom of the hour.
[00:56:15.830 --> 00:56:21.572]  How, as we look at Paul Ryan and others, they say, Hill said, what are they going to do?
[00:56:21.612 --> 00:56:23.673]  Because we've got another infrastructure bill coming up this year.
[00:56:23.853 --> 00:56:27.175]  And last year, Paul Ryan led the fight to strike
[00:56:27.835 --> 00:56:56.083]  By American out of the infrastructure bill last year, so we got another one coming up this year So we contacted him the hill contacted him and Paul Ryan said no comment They had no comment from his office And we also know that the guy that he replaced the guy that helped him to get his position John Boehner Had left in October 2015 in March of 2016 five months later when they're doing this bill this infrastructure bill where they stripped out the Buy American Clause last year that
[00:56:57.347 --> 00:57:09.838]  His company that he went to work for, a lobbyist company there in Washington, D.C., was representing foreign steel concerns and saying, we want to get this Buy American stuff out of there.
[00:57:10.419 --> 00:57:12.841]  See, that's the swamp that we're talking about.
[00:57:13.041 --> 00:57:15.303]  And of course, Nancy Pelosi is a big part of that as well.
[00:57:15.928 --> 00:57:27.211]  Nancy Pelosi and her insider trading, they get caught on it, they say, hey, there's no controlling legal authority here, that's not a problem, so we create the Stock Act, we wait until you don't pay any attention, and then six months later, boom, we got it.
[00:57:28.071 --> 00:57:29.511]  So it has absolutely no effect.
[00:57:30.351 --> 00:57:35.213]  Nancy Pelosi, Elizabeth Warren, they're all involved in these types of ethics insider trading.
[00:57:35.273 --> 00:57:39.053]  Nancy Pelosi's family has made a fortune off of that kind of insider trading.
[00:57:39.714 --> 00:57:43.014]  And of course, Paul Ryan is part of that swamp as well, a big part of that swamp.
[00:57:43.274 --> 00:57:44.895]  And so when you look at the New York Times article,
[00:57:45.735 --> 00:57:49.661]  Angst simmers in Washington as a Trump presidency nears.
[00:57:49.721 --> 00:57:53.367]  Understand, what they're concerned about is protecting their financial situation.
[00:57:53.427 --> 00:57:56.591]  They want to make sure they're going to be high-paid lobbyists, that they're going to stay there forever.
[00:57:56.832 --> 00:58:00.377]  They're going to hammer Donald Trump and say, you're here for the money, aren't you?
[00:58:01.318 --> 00:58:03.479]  Everything that he does, they're going to say, you've got a conflict of interest.
[00:58:03.499 --> 00:58:05.100]  You own this hotel, that's a conflict of interest.
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:08.322]  You've got somebody that's from a foreign government staying in your hotel, that's a conflict of interest.
[00:58:08.342 --> 00:58:16.207]  And that's what Donald Trump was originally going to talk about at the press conference, but then they dumped that dirt on him, the dirty dossier.
[00:58:16.387 --> 00:58:18.309]  He has a plan to deal with that.
[00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:29.516]  But it really is about them being concerned that the Trump Organization isn't going to just enact a hiring freeze, which would be something that would benefit all Americans, but he's actually going to do spending cuts
[00:58:30.376 --> 00:58:33.697]  Which would even benefit us more, but not the Washington, D.C.
[00:58:33.737 --> 00:58:34.077]  crowd.
[00:58:34.677 --> 00:58:37.978]  They're worried that there's going to be some actual cuts of workers.
[00:58:38.159 --> 00:58:39.119]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:58:39.859 --> 00:58:41.760]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:45.561]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:49.758 --> 00:58:55.184]  With the inauguration around the corner, here's what we know about the fascists who are trying to obstruct Donald Trump's inauguration.
[00:58:55.344 --> 00:59:00.649]  Hundreds of thousands will be there to protest the inauguration of Trump, marching and chanting in the streets over fake news.
[00:59:00.790 --> 00:59:01.771]  But it has gotten darker.
[00:59:02.111 --> 00:59:05.514]  Advertisements to pay Trump protesters cropping up in dozens of U.S.
[00:59:05.555 --> 00:59:05.835]  cities.
[00:59:06.055 --> 00:59:08.517]  People like Rosie McDonald calling for martial law.
[00:59:08.657 --> 00:59:11.279]  Charles Schumer threatening Trump with the intelligence community.
[00:59:11.419 --> 00:59:15.443]  Michael Moore marching in the Women's March against Trump, pushing anti-Trump false narratives.
[00:59:15.643 --> 00:59:17.104]  We know about the fake dossiers.
[00:59:17.284 --> 00:59:20.907]  And now more is emerging as radical leftists are planning violent protests.
[00:59:21.107 --> 00:59:24.770]  Plans for planting and discharging acidic chemicals into ventilation systems.
[00:59:24.931 --> 00:59:28.854]  Disrupt J20 is mobilizing thousands and planning on blocking streets and transit.
[00:59:28.994 --> 00:59:31.376]  In response, there will be unprecedented security.
[00:59:31.516 --> 00:59:42.941]  We fully support the First Amendment and the exercise thereof, but people plotting illegal activities need to be brought into custody now, perhaps even arrested, to deter these fascists from illegally disrupting the peaceful transition of power.
[00:59:43.061 --> 00:59:45.162]  But something tells me that's not going to happen.
[00:59:45.282 --> 00:59:48.763]  This is Owen Troyer, and InfoWars will see you at the inauguration.
[00:59:50.964 --> 00:59:56.867]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:09.694 --> 01:00:13.162]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:00:13.743 --> 01:00:15.507]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:20.103 --> 01:00:21.483]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:21.504 --> 01:00:22.084]  I'm David Knight.
[01:00:22.704 --> 01:00:38.889]  In our next segment, we're going to be talking to James O'Keefe of Project Veritas, talking to us about this undercover investigation they're conducting in terms of these people who are, and some of them has now come out, there's ads are being run in 20 different states across the country saying we'll pay you $2,500.
[01:00:41.004 --> 01:00:41.905]  Be a protester.
[01:00:43.266 --> 01:00:44.627]  A grassroots protester.
[01:00:44.827 --> 01:00:45.348]  No, no, no.
[01:00:45.368 --> 01:00:49.271]  You're not a grassroots protester if they're paying you that kind of money.
[01:00:49.291 --> 01:00:51.853]  $50 an hour, they're saying they're going to pay these people to do that.
[01:00:51.913 --> 01:00:53.795]  But they did an undercover investigation.
[01:00:54.355 --> 01:01:02.342]  They got video of people talking about how they wanted to infiltrate the Deplora Ball, one of the inauguration balls, and release butyric acid.
[01:01:02.362 --> 01:01:05.344]  So we're going to talk to him about that, about his upcoming Part 2.
[01:01:06.744 --> 01:01:07.344]  Of that report.
[01:01:07.705 --> 01:01:14.369]  But I want to finish with what I was talking about in terms of the pushback from the Washington establishment.
[01:01:14.389 --> 01:01:20.673]  You know, in this New York Times article, they talk about high-powered lobbyists who are worrying their clients will turn up in a Twitter feed.
[01:01:20.713 --> 01:01:26.177]  Civil servants who say they know that Trump knows nothing about running a bureaucracy, so we have to defer to them.
[01:01:26.197 --> 01:01:29.659]  You know, we're now this Byzantine Empire where the bureaucrats run our country.
[01:01:29.679 --> 01:01:30.440]  Now they do.
[01:01:31.013 --> 01:01:31.293]  They do.
[01:01:31.313 --> 01:01:33.355]  I mean, look at what the EPA in particular is doing.
[01:01:33.375 --> 01:01:36.398]  But of course, there's been a massive amount of regulations.
[01:01:36.438 --> 01:01:37.558]  I reported on this yesterday.
[01:01:37.639 --> 01:01:44.444]  There's been, I think it was 87 rules that were passed by Congress in 2015, but 3,400 rules?
[01:01:44.784 --> 01:01:47.807]  See, if they call it a rule, they can do anything they want.
[01:01:48.621 --> 01:01:52.407]  The prohibitions against excessive fines, excessive punishment, that doesn't apply.
[01:01:52.427 --> 01:01:55.892]  And we've seen that happen with the EPA particularly coming after that.
[01:01:56.052 --> 01:02:03.843]  Remember that one farmer that had an eight acre plot in Montana and he built a stock pond for his animals and for the kids to play in?
[01:02:04.644 --> 01:02:10.031]  And the EPA came after him with tens of thousands of dollars of fines per day and then tried to garnish his wages.
[01:02:10.071 --> 01:02:10.651]  He was a welder.
[01:02:11.152 --> 01:02:14.015]  So the prohibitions against unreasonable fines don't apply.
[01:02:14.035 --> 01:02:19.081]  You've got the FAA saying, hey, we're going to put massive fines against you if you don't register your toy drone.
[01:02:20.034 --> 01:02:21.375]  And these people do whatever they wish.
[01:02:21.435 --> 01:02:26.257]  You don't have the presumption of innocence either because they say it's a civil regulation, not a criminal offense in most cases.
[01:02:27.097 --> 01:02:29.038]  So that is something that's very dangerous.
[01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:31.399]  These people are saying, hey, you know, we're really concerned about this.
[01:02:31.459 --> 01:02:38.223]  And even the New York Times points out this region is one of the largest and wealthiest economies in the world.
[01:02:38.663 --> 01:02:40.384]  And that's pointed out by the Brookings Institution.
[01:02:40.404 --> 01:02:41.184]  They know that very well.
[01:02:41.844 --> 01:02:48.748]  These people, like the elites at Davos, have been pigs feeding at the trough at our expense.
[01:02:49.909 --> 01:02:51.010]  And that's why people are angry.
[01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:53.471]  You know, you have this dichotomy that's going on here.
[01:02:53.491 --> 01:02:55.533]  A lot of people go, oh, look at the stock market, look how great it's done.
[01:02:55.713 --> 01:03:04.479]  Well, of course, most of this stock market that you see, that you're going to see Barack Obama take credit for in a few years, he said, look at the stock market when I left office.
[01:03:05.099 --> 01:03:19.229]  Most of the stock market run up that you've seen this year has come post-election, in terms of people anticipating that Trump is going to cut taxes, cut regulation, cut the chains that Obama and the bureaucracy have forged upon us.
[01:03:20.349 --> 01:03:23.430]  And so that's a response to what people are anticipating happening.
[01:03:24.010 --> 01:03:28.832]  But these people look at it and they say, wait a minute, you might actually cut federal workers, you might actually cut our budget.
[01:03:29.592 --> 01:03:37.115]  Just like Davos is looking at this and in spite of the fact that they've accumulated gross amounts of wealth just in the last year, as we reported yesterday.
[01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:45.037]  In the last year, they had 62 people that had as much money as half of the world.
[01:03:45.578 --> 01:03:47.580]  And that changed just in the last year to only 8.
[01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:47.820]  Only 8.
[01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:48.641]  And 3 of those 8
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:53.042]  Run major media organizations here in the United States.
[01:03:53.582 --> 01:03:56.124]  The New York Times, Washington Post, Bloomberg.
[01:03:56.964 --> 01:04:01.587]  Three of those eight guys who have wealth equivalent to half of the world's population.
[01:04:01.627 --> 01:04:03.549]  So that's the kind of concentration that we're seeing.
[01:04:04.169 --> 01:04:09.753]  And it truly is, in this respect, in terms of sovereignty, when you talk about who gets to make the decisions.
[01:04:10.825 --> 01:04:11.685]  About your life?
[01:04:11.965 --> 01:04:13.266]  That is a zero-sum game.
[01:04:13.486 --> 01:04:18.688]  You can grow the economy and everybody, we can cut regulation and taxes and everybody can get wealthier.
[01:04:18.728 --> 01:04:21.349]  We don't have to worry that somebody over here is making more money than us.
[01:04:21.409 --> 01:04:30.492]  But when you see this kind of concentration of wealth, that is coming from the kind of regulations that cut the rungs off of the ladders for people who want to start a small business.
[01:04:31.252 --> 01:04:33.614]  And that's why small business is so optimistic.
[01:04:33.654 --> 01:04:42.041]  At the same time, and you can see this article, we'll probably talk about this later in the broadcast, on Dredge Report, as robots take jobs, Europeans maul free money for all.
[01:04:42.061 --> 01:04:43.902]  It's what I talked about and have been talking about.
[01:04:43.922 --> 01:04:44.743]  I talked about that yesterday.
[01:04:45.023 --> 01:04:46.044]  Universal basic income.
[01:04:46.204 --> 01:04:48.987]  They want to put you all on welfare.
[01:04:49.767 --> 01:04:50.628]  It's a soft kill.
[01:04:50.988 --> 01:04:51.949]  It's a pacification.
[01:04:52.249 --> 01:04:54.991]  It's what they did to the Indians on the reservation.
[01:04:55.032 --> 01:04:55.932]  That's Agenda 21.
[01:04:55.972 --> 01:04:57.654]  That's the template for Agenda 21.
[01:04:57.694 --> 01:04:58.935]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:04:59.435 --> 01:05:02.399]  Nobody loves Barack Obama more than Barack Obama.
[01:05:02.559 --> 01:05:07.986]  In his speech during the Chicago Cubs World Series visit to the White House, he referred to himself a humble 40 times.
[01:05:08.206 --> 01:05:12.571]  In his farewell address, one of his many farewells, he referred to himself 75 times.
[01:05:12.792 --> 01:05:16.556]  When campaigning for Hillary Clinton in Philadelphia last year, he referred to himself 137 times.
[01:05:18.058 --> 01:05:25.625]  After the police shooting in Dallas, Obama delivered an address in which he referred to himself 45 times, not once referencing himself as one to blame.
[01:05:25.845 --> 01:05:30.189]  After a mass shooting in Oregon, in a 12-minute speech, he referenced himself 28 times.
[01:05:30.409 --> 01:05:35.013]  At the Democratic National Convention, Obama referred to himself a whopping 119 times.
[01:05:35.173 --> 01:05:37.475]  Some attendees were confused and thought he was running again.
[01:05:37.656 --> 01:05:40.158]  When speaking in India last year, he referred to himself 118 times.
[01:05:41.539 --> 01:05:42.940]  It's an international love fest.
[01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:47.263]  In a speech on jobs in Ohio in 2010, Barack referenced himself 132 times.
[01:05:47.303 --> 01:05:52.926]  But I want you to understand, this is not about me.
[01:05:53.166 --> 01:05:56.168]  And every morning he eats a bowl of Berrios to start his day.
[01:05:56.368 --> 01:05:58.470]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[01:05:59.511 --> 01:06:06.616]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[01:06:06.977 --> 01:06:20.186]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.

[01:07:17.397 --> 01:07:20.500]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[01:07:21.311 --> 01:07:23.171]  And they're also very affordable.
[01:07:45.296 --> 01:07:52.020]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:53.180]  It's a win-win.
[01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:54.441]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:08:13.926 --> 01:08:18.349]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:08:18.769 --> 01:08:21.731]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:08:28.484 --> 01:08:29.746]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:29.806 --> 01:08:30.367]  I'm David Knight.
[01:08:30.407 --> 01:08:36.635]  On this Tuesday, January 17, 2017, joining us now is James O'Keefe with Project Veritas.
[01:08:36.655 --> 01:08:39.739]  Yesterday, we showed part one of his investigation.
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.984]  They did an undercover investigation of people who were planning to
[01:08:44.045 --> 01:08:51.728]  Not only interrupt the deplorable, not only to try to shut it down, but also to engage in criminal operations.
[01:08:51.748 --> 01:08:56.709]  We're going to talk to him about that report, also about the upcoming report, part two of that investigation.
[01:08:57.249 --> 01:09:00.550]  James O'Keefe, of course, as you know, is president of Project Veritas.
[01:09:00.931 --> 01:09:08.153]  He's well known for his 2009 ACORN investigation, the systematic corruption that he discovered and showed in multiple offices that ultimately
[01:09:08.673 --> 01:09:09.294]  We're good to go.
[01:09:37.037 --> 01:09:40.658]  influence in exposing the truth, of course.
[01:09:40.678 --> 01:09:42.119]  That's what Project Veritas means.
[01:09:42.139 --> 01:09:43.679]  I mean, that's what we always see.
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:52.683]  Whenever he exposes the truth, actually, we see the same thing happen that they always do when a whistleblower talks about criminal operations, shows corruption.
[01:09:52.983 --> 01:09:55.344]  They always attack the messenger.
[01:09:55.584 --> 01:09:56.844]  They come after the whistleblower.
[01:09:56.864 --> 01:10:00.105]  That's one thing that Barack Obama will be remembered for.
[01:10:00.145 --> 01:10:02.006]  But joining us now is James O'Keefe.
[01:10:02.086 --> 01:10:02.906]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:10:03.567 --> 01:10:04.347]  Hey, great to be with you.
[01:10:05.051 --> 01:10:11.094]  Tell us a little bit about, let's break down this part one that we saw yesterday.
[01:10:11.114 --> 01:10:19.977]  Of course, what they were talking about doing was releasing butyric acid in the deporbal, and that is the thing that gives human vomit its smell.
[01:10:20.057 --> 01:10:22.258]  It's a very disgusting, intolerable smell.
[01:10:22.278 --> 01:10:23.099]  It makes people sick.
[01:10:23.139 --> 01:10:23.779]  They want to do that.
[01:10:23.879 --> 01:10:28.241]  But, in concentration, it is an acid, and so it'll burn your skin, it'll burn your lungs.
[01:10:28.701 --> 01:10:29.781]  It's a very dangerous thing.
[01:10:29.861 --> 01:10:33.563]  That's a criminal conspiracy, isn't it, James?
[01:10:34.161 --> 01:10:36.084]  Yeah, it's actually covered under the D.C.
[01:10:36.645 --> 01:10:38.307]  anti-terrorism statutes.
[01:10:38.968 --> 01:10:41.292]  And it's not just a prank.
[01:10:41.352 --> 01:10:49.524]  This acid could, it's a flammable material, it could burn your lungs, it could cause a stampede out of the National Press Club, people trampling one another.
[01:10:50.084 --> 01:10:54.227]  It's considered terrorism and we took the footage of the FBI.
[01:10:54.687 --> 01:10:58.030]  They had these people's names and numbers.
[01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:59.051]  They had their last names.
[01:10:59.491 --> 01:11:03.994]  When we took this footage to them, they thanked us and said they were going to be launching an investigation.
[01:11:04.574 --> 01:11:07.837]  And they also said they wanted to set off the sprinkler systems and get people wet.
[01:11:08.297 --> 01:11:09.558]  It's going to be cold outside.
[01:11:10.038 --> 01:11:13.562]  They want to do as much harm physically to people as possible.
[01:11:14.142 --> 01:11:19.107]  And then, of course, they responded by saying, well, we were just, we were just punking me.
[01:11:19.767 --> 01:11:28.616]  Well, if that's the case, then why did they continue to send these plans and emails, follow up with more emails, talking about how they're going to do this.
[01:11:28.656 --> 01:11:30.077]  They did recon of the building.
[01:11:30.117 --> 01:11:33.881]  They cased the building to ensure they could actually carry out these plans.
[01:11:34.521 --> 01:11:36.683]  And of course we see this all the time.
[01:11:36.763 --> 01:11:39.365]  People have a right to exercise their free speech and I think that the
[01:11:50.014 --> 01:11:50.555]  We're good to go.
[01:12:11.673 --> 01:12:21.380]  We're talking about people who are being paid to agitate, and we have seen this in the run-up to the election, that they get violent with people, that they instigate violence.
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:26.884]  And then of course, that violence is blamed on Donald Trump, or on Trump supporters, and not on the people who go there as paid agitators.
[01:12:26.904 --> 01:12:29.606]  The Washington Times has a story today that's on the Drudge Report.
[01:12:30.046 --> 01:12:31.546]  Talking about how they're going to pay people up to $2,500.
[01:12:31.626 --> 01:12:36.808]  They say, hey, we'll pay you $50 an hour, we want you to do six events a year, so forth and so on.
[01:12:36.848 --> 01:12:44.690]  I mean, this is, and we know we've seen George Soros involved in it, but when you're talking about stampeding, it's very important what you said there.
[01:12:44.810 --> 01:12:50.131]  Trying to stampede people out of a venue like that, that is a very dangerous situation.
[01:12:50.151 --> 01:12:54.712]  We've all known of situations, just look at Black Friday at Walmart.
[01:12:54.952 --> 01:12:57.636]  People that get trampled and injured at Walmart.
[01:12:57.656 --> 01:12:59.818]  But this is trying to create a situation like that.
[01:13:00.079 --> 01:13:06.246]  Trying to create something where people get trampled at a massive crowd, like a concert or something like that.
[01:13:06.266 --> 01:13:07.508]  It's going to be a large number of people.
[01:13:08.049 --> 01:13:11.974]  And they're trying to do something that is very dangerous to people.
[01:13:12.014 --> 01:13:12.775]  It ought to be a crime.
[01:13:13.424 --> 01:13:14.205]  Yeah, it is a crime.
[01:13:14.245 --> 01:13:16.549]  It's considered under the anti-terrorism statute.
[01:13:16.849 --> 01:13:24.280]  You have the statute up in front of you there, but it's punishable by a five-year prison sentence and significant fine.
[01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:26.183]  We have another video coming out here.
[01:13:26.724 --> 01:13:33.910]  Momentarily, that will show not just the butyric acid aspects, but they're also going to try to shut down the railroads.
[01:13:34.531 --> 01:13:34.591]  Wow.
[01:13:34.611 --> 01:13:37.513]  And they're going to try to disrupt public transportation.
[01:13:37.993 --> 01:13:54.927]  And these groups, this is not just an isolated group, this anti-fascist league works with a bunch of different other groups, the League of Conservation Voters in California, Workers of the World Party, and by the way, it's kind of ironic that the anti-fascists are planning on gassing people.
[01:13:55.788 --> 01:14:00.852]  I mean, I hate to make a joke, but in the HVAC system, it's just bizarre.
[01:14:01.313 --> 01:14:11.741]  And as you see there on the screen, this guy named Scott Green had these planning meetings inside of a house where he's talking about the people that were intimately involved in the top secret plan.
[01:14:11.781 --> 01:14:13.323]  He's referring to our journalists.
[01:14:13.763 --> 01:14:18.087]  The media right now is trying to make this whole thing out to be like, it's just a joke.
[01:14:18.227 --> 01:14:19.288]  They were playing me.
[01:14:19.308 --> 01:14:21.029]  I was inciting them.
[01:14:21.049 --> 01:14:22.310]  I didn't say a word.
[01:14:23.391 --> 01:14:25.192]  Not a word about any of this stuff.
[01:14:25.232 --> 01:14:26.333]  We were there to listen.
[01:14:26.813 --> 01:14:29.694]  And one of our people did get compromised and did get found out.
[01:14:29.734 --> 01:14:31.315]  But we had more people who were on the inside.
[01:14:31.915 --> 01:14:34.357]  And they were telling us all these plans and we just listened.
[01:14:35.037 --> 01:14:39.760]  And then they sent a follow-up email on January 21st and said the quote, the recon went pretty well.
[01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:44.382]  We left with confidence that we can accomplish our objective with no negative consequences for our side.
[01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:46.489]  CC'ing our journalist.
[01:14:47.010 --> 01:14:50.891]  So their excuse that they were playing along turns out to be a total fraud.
[01:14:50.931 --> 01:14:51.951]  There you have it right there.
[01:14:52.351 --> 01:14:55.132]  Scott Green, CC'ing our journalist on that.
[01:14:55.152 --> 01:14:56.792]  God, your producers are great, by the way.
[01:14:57.312 --> 01:14:58.573]  That was fast.
[01:14:59.093 --> 01:15:01.453]  CC'ing our journalist, Tyler.
[01:15:01.553 --> 01:15:04.774]  We use the name Tyler and it's in one of the email addresses.
[01:15:04.814 --> 01:15:10.756]  So they, there it is, Tyler Marshall, 1992, was our journalist playing that role.
[01:15:11.770 --> 01:15:17.655]  And why would he be sending emails to the entire group if they were really counter-stinging us?
[01:15:17.735 --> 01:15:24.080]  They would have immediately told people that they caught us or put the video out like they did in another occasion.
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:40.454]  So, I'm really disgusted by, again, the mainstream media trying to bury this, but the good news is we have another video coming out here momentarily that shows their plans to, and hopefully people get arrested, because we wouldn't want this to actually happen on Thursday.
[01:15:40.874 --> 01:15:41.274]  Absolutely.
[01:15:41.495 --> 01:15:52.262]  And you're not the... We also had another recording that it was not as detailed as your undercover investigation, but it was somebody at a meeting where they're talking about similar types of things.
[01:15:52.282 --> 01:16:00.287]  So we see that, we see these ads going other places, and yet when you expose it, we're just joking, or you're the problem, as I said before.
[01:16:00.307 --> 01:16:05.731]  They always come after the whistleblower and make you the issue, just as they did with Hillary Clinton's emails.
[01:16:05.771 --> 01:16:07.752]  It wasn't a problem what we learned about Hillary Clinton.
[01:16:07.772 --> 01:16:09.233]  It wasn't a problem what we learned about the DNC.
[01:16:10.694 --> 01:16:11.394]  We expose that.
[01:16:12.435 --> 01:16:14.416]  That's what they do every time this stuff comes out.
[01:16:15.096 --> 01:16:17.037]  Yeah, that's what Alex and I talk about all the time.
[01:16:17.097 --> 01:16:20.079]  It's the pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, polarize it.
[01:16:20.519 --> 01:16:23.941]  I just got a question asked by Snopes.com.
[01:16:24.441 --> 01:16:26.923]  I mean, ridiculous.
[01:16:26.963 --> 01:16:29.284]  By the way, you want to talk about fake news?
[01:16:29.324 --> 01:16:29.504]  Yeah.
[01:16:29.564 --> 01:16:33.966]  Isn't Facebook subcontracting with them or partnering with them or something like that?
[01:16:34.367 --> 01:16:36.288]  Bethany Palma, this was a few minutes ago.
[01:16:37.388 --> 01:16:39.431]  She didn't even ask me about this video.
[01:16:39.851 --> 01:16:44.977]  She said, back in December, you were exposed by trying to meet with someone.
[01:16:45.037 --> 01:16:47.659]  I said, Bethany, why aren't you asking about this video?
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:53.225]  And back in October, Bethany said, quote, virtually impossible to fact check without complete clips.
[01:16:53.726 --> 01:16:55.568]  And quote, out of context remarks.
[01:16:56.670 --> 01:16:59.031]  I mean, what's out of context?
[01:16:59.091 --> 01:17:04.494]  For you to report that something's out of context, you have to provide your audience the evidence that it's out of context.
[01:17:05.495 --> 01:17:19.402]  It's really, I mean, I can't tell you how disgusting and corrupt these people, Snopes.com, and the fact that Facebook is using them as a substantial source to corroborate information, it's outrageous.
[01:17:19.442 --> 01:17:23.244]  But again, the good news is, we're going to keep dripping out information
[01:17:23.844 --> 01:17:25.725]  And they can do all the damage control.
[01:17:25.785 --> 01:17:29.226]  We release more videotape exposing that they're doing damage control.
[01:17:29.266 --> 01:17:30.526]  This is how you have to fight these people.
[01:17:31.087 --> 01:17:37.149]  Well, you know, it's disgusting that we have these media guardians.
[01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:39.870]  These people are going to be final arbiters of the truth being appointed.
[01:17:39.890 --> 01:17:48.072]  And the thing that concerns me even more about that is they've funded now the State Department of all places to be arbiters of what's true and to push back against things.
[01:17:48.112 --> 01:17:49.073]  We're talking about Facebook.
[01:17:49.753 --> 01:17:56.799]  And Snopes, of course, I'm sure you're aware of the nasty divorce that happened with the couple that runs Snopes.
[01:17:56.899 --> 01:18:00.682]  And literally, as Gerald Salenti always called them, prostitute media.
[01:18:01.223 --> 01:18:06.888]  We found that they've got as key members of the organization, one who's still actively working
[01:18:07.529 --> 01:18:11.915]  As an escort, as a prostitute, another who's working as a dominatrix.
[01:18:11.975 --> 01:18:14.699]  And so they quite literally are the prostitute media.
[01:18:14.739 --> 01:18:16.963]  They will go to the highest bidder.
[01:18:17.003 --> 01:18:20.147]  In this particular case, I'm sure they're getting paid pretty well by Facebook.
[01:18:20.168 --> 01:18:20.909]  He's got a lot of money.
[01:18:22.064 --> 01:18:26.146]  I can't believe how fast your producers are when you talk.
[01:18:26.806 --> 01:18:27.586]  That's incredible.
[01:18:27.886 --> 01:18:29.367]  Yes, there you have it.
[01:18:30.147 --> 01:18:36.509]  And not to scoop myself, but we have people, this year, the number one target of ours is going to be the media.
[01:18:36.909 --> 01:18:37.849]  That is the target.
[01:18:37.929 --> 01:18:40.250]  They are the ones to elect our politicians.
[01:18:40.570 --> 01:18:46.592]  They were actually very ineffective this past year at electing our politicians, but they are the number one target.
[01:18:46.672 --> 01:18:48.893]  They do not want to report.
[01:18:51.812 --> 01:18:55.935]  On the fact that people are going to cause havoc and violence on Thursday and Friday.
[01:18:56.295 --> 01:18:59.177]  And if this stuff actually happens, the media is now complicit.
[01:18:59.197 --> 01:18:59.917]  This is criminal.
[01:19:00.237 --> 01:19:00.417]  Yeah.
[01:19:00.598 --> 01:19:01.658]  What the media is doing.
[01:19:01.718 --> 01:19:08.302]  It's criminal for them to try to turn it around on the person who's exposing the violence.
[01:19:08.883 --> 01:19:10.304]  I say do your job, Snopes.
[01:19:10.384 --> 01:19:11.845]  Call the FBI right now.
[01:19:12.245 --> 01:19:16.928]  I'll even give you the names of the people that my lawyer met with and get a comment from them.
[01:19:16.988 --> 01:19:18.309]  Are these people being arrested?
[01:19:18.889 --> 01:19:20.550]  They're talking about gassing people?
[01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:21.470]  Yeah.
[01:19:21.650 --> 01:19:22.571]  At the press club?
[01:19:22.871 --> 01:19:32.516]  So anyways... Well that's why it's so important what you're doing because their narrative is to pretend that there's going to be some kind of spontaneous conflict and it's who started it?
[01:19:32.556 --> 01:19:33.376]  Did that side start it?
[01:19:33.416 --> 01:19:34.277]  Did the other side start it?
[01:19:34.577 --> 01:19:44.342]  If you show that they've been premeditating this type of activity then that kind of destroys their whole narrative that oh it was the Trump supporters who started this when
[01:19:44.522 --> 01:19:46.604]  We were just there innocently standing by.
[01:19:46.624 --> 01:19:49.627]  We're going to be right back with James O'Keefe, Project Veritas.
[01:19:49.647 --> 01:19:53.050]  We're going to talk about part two of that undercover investigation.
[01:19:53.090 --> 01:19:53.651]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:00.216 --> 01:20:05.020]  More than 20 years ago, when I started InfoWars, I was a fitness addict.
[01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:12.225]  As time went on, my metabolism slowed down, I quit working out, I was working 18 hours a day, and I gained right at 100 pounds.
[01:20:12.485 --> 01:20:14.887]  I started to exercise really hard again.
[01:20:15.447 --> 01:20:20.973]  I started to try to eat healthy, started taking third-party supplements, started seeing some more gains.
[01:20:21.493 --> 01:20:31.883]  But when I started working with Dr. Grip and some of the other top formulators in the country, they said, Alex, it's all about trace elements and things that the population is absolutely deficient in.
[01:20:32.044 --> 01:20:32.304]  Boom!
[01:20:32.724 --> 01:20:36.148]  Weight started pouring off, toxins started coming out of my body.
[01:20:36.628 --> 01:20:37.789]  Then, by early 2016,
[01:20:39.831 --> 01:20:43.193]  I was in the best shape of my life since I'd been in really good shape in my 20s.
[01:20:43.213 --> 01:20:44.274]  But the election heated up.
[01:20:44.334 --> 01:20:46.695]  I started working 14, 15, 16 hours a day.
[01:20:46.815 --> 01:20:56.060]  But more importantly, I stopped taking supplements because we rearranged the kitchen and somebody took the Lazy Susan off the kitchen table where I took some every morning and I just kind of forgot about it.
[01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:57.241]  It was out of sight, out of mind.
[01:20:57.421 --> 01:21:01.103]  And so then I realized this morning, I said, we're going to put the Lazy Susan back on the table.
[01:21:01.923 --> 01:21:07.986]  And I'm going to start taking it religiously again, and I'm going to work out like I've been the last few weeks at the same level.
[01:21:08.026 --> 01:21:09.346]  It's the holidays, so I'll probably eat more.
[01:21:09.406 --> 01:21:12.948]  And whatever the results are, I'm going to publish the findings.
[01:21:14.813 --> 01:21:21.598]  I put the Lazy Susan back on the table, I'm religiously taking the products, and in just one week, I thought I'd lose two or three pounds.
[01:21:21.958 --> 01:21:28.442]  I've lost five pounds religiously taking just, what, four or five of the products.
[01:21:28.823 --> 01:21:29.343]  It's amazing.
[01:21:29.643 --> 01:21:32.025]  Infowarslife.com products are incredible.
[01:21:32.305 --> 01:21:34.967]  Go read the five-star reviews for yourself.
[01:21:38.677 --> 01:21:39.298]  Well, here we are.
[01:21:39.358 --> 01:21:40.439]  Another week has passed.
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:53.133]  If memory serves, I lost five pounds the first week, three pounds the next, and only one pound this week because it's the holidays, there's fudge, there's candy, it's everywhere, and I've been picking out eggnog, you name it.
[01:21:53.173 --> 01:21:55.115]  This is the worst time of year, but usually you're gaining weight.
[01:21:55.575 --> 01:21:58.518]  I've lost a pound, so we're now up to nine pounds.
[01:21:59.525 --> 01:22:03.746]  And I've only got, you know, a week and a half left or so until we see what happens with this experiment.
[01:22:03.766 --> 01:22:05.347]  But I'm pretty happy with 9 pounds.
[01:22:05.367 --> 01:22:07.447]  But I want to lose 5 or 6 more.
[01:22:08.287 --> 01:22:12.969]  But as I said, I'm working out less, I'm eating more, I'm taking the supplements, I'm losing weight.
[01:22:13.509 --> 01:22:15.969]  Whatever is doing to me metabolically is amazing.
[01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:17.610]  Let's see what happens next week.
[01:22:21.618 --> 01:22:23.819]  Well, this is the final update on our little experiment.
[01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:28.681]  I started out in early December, and indeed, I pigged out over Christmas even more than usual.
[01:22:29.421 --> 01:22:33.923]  I did have better and more intense workouts because of Supermail, and just what it does to my mental picture.
[01:22:33.963 --> 01:22:42.547]  But taking the entire family of InfoWars life products, the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Fruit Punch, Multivitamin, all of it with the amino acids,
[01:22:43.127 --> 01:22:45.668]  Taking it all religiously, every day, but once or twice.
[01:22:45.688 --> 01:22:48.728]  So I started in like, I don't know, December 3rd, 4th or so.
[01:22:48.909 --> 01:22:53.230]  Finished, what was it, about January 4th was the last day of the final photos I took just a few days ago.
[01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:55.630]  Then I left town for a few days, that's why this is a voice memo.
[01:22:55.970 --> 01:22:57.911]  I didn't shoot the final, final video.
[01:22:58.071 --> 01:23:00.612]  But what I'm getting at is, it really does work.
[01:23:00.932 --> 01:23:02.312]  Despite the fact that the day after Christmas,
[01:23:02.412 --> 01:23:09.758]  Christmas, I ate almost an entire pie that my mother had brought over, a pumpkin pie, and the day before that had three pieces of cherry pie.
[01:23:10.338 --> 01:23:23.609]  I'm not a big sweets person, but around the holidays, fudge, well, you know how it is, folks, hot cocoa, it's just, since I was a kid, the only time I tend to eat a lot of sweets is maybe at birthday parties or around Christmas, and I just picked out this year.
[01:23:24.109 --> 01:23:25.651]  In fact, I was going to stop the experiment.
[01:23:25.671 --> 01:23:26.892]  I thought, well, this just isn't fair.
[01:23:26.912 --> 01:23:29.394]  I mean, I'm eating way more and working out less.
[01:23:30.334 --> 01:23:34.176]  This isn't going to happen, but we went ahead and did the experiment and I still lost some weight.
[01:23:34.816 --> 01:23:51.264]  It wasn't as much as I'd wanted to, but to me it proves the fact that again, metabolically, the things that God's given us through nature and having the good halogen and all the other things that are in the products in me helped me just lose weight while I was actually eating more.
[01:23:51.724 --> 01:23:52.424]  It's hard to believe.
[01:23:52.804 --> 01:23:55.166]  Infowarslife.com products are incredible.
[01:23:55.446 --> 01:23:58.127]  Go read the five star reviews for yourself.
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:12.901]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:12.941 --> 01:24:15.903]  I'm David Knight and we're talking to James O'Keefe with Project Veritas.
[01:24:15.923 --> 01:24:18.345]  Of course, their website is projectveritas.com.
[01:24:20.293 --> 01:24:29.919]  Part two of the undercover investigation of people who are plotting to disrupt the Trump inauguration is uploading now, isn't it, James, on your side?
[01:24:29.980 --> 01:24:30.860]  It's not quite ready.
[01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:32.741]  I'm looking through my production room.
[01:24:32.921 --> 01:24:37.164]  It's exporting and uploading to YouTube and Twitter and Facebook here.
[01:24:37.585 --> 01:24:38.125]  OK.
[01:24:38.365 --> 01:24:45.870]  It basically involves, it's going to be out momentarily, involves a plot to shut down the trains in D.C.
[01:24:45.930 --> 01:24:49.513]  to actually commit conventional terrorism to
[01:24:50.533 --> 01:24:51.294]  We're good.
[01:25:06.707 --> 01:25:09.911]  And put pressure on law enforcement agencies for a comment here.
[01:25:10.572 --> 01:25:11.673]  I've done everything I can.
[01:25:11.713 --> 01:25:15.558]  This is the second installment that we'll be releasing and it really gets into the weeds.
[01:25:15.618 --> 01:25:17.200]  It shows all their planning meetings.
[01:25:17.260 --> 01:25:18.362]  It shows phone calls.
[01:25:18.942 --> 01:25:21.065]  It shows emails about what they intend to do.
[01:25:22.256 --> 01:25:31.920]  And you know, when we saw these so-called demonstrations against the Trump rallies, we had situations where ambulances were blocked because of situations that these people created.
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:46.946]  That is something that affects, you know, people who are in emergency services, as well as the attacks on the vehicles that they blocked, putting paint on them, keying them, attacking people just because they thought they were Trump supporters.
[01:25:47.626 --> 01:26:04.179]  That is the type of thing that these people do, and as we said in the last segment, they always portray this as, well, you know, hey, we were just there as protesters exercising our First Amendment speech, and then that other guy started it, and, you know, we don't know who threw the first punch or whatever, but now...
[01:26:04.879 --> 01:26:18.528]  You see these people ahead of time, that's why it's very important you're undercover investigation, because it shows that this was their premeditated intent to create this type of situation, not that it was something that just spontaneously happened as they were exercising their First Amendment rights.
[01:26:18.928 --> 01:26:19.428]  Not at all.
[01:26:19.588 --> 01:26:28.013]  No, I support strongly the right of people to peaceably demonstrate and voice their opinions and voice their First Amendment rights.
[01:26:28.053 --> 01:26:29.855]  This is not peaceful.
[01:26:29.975 --> 01:26:33.557]  This is all illegal, criminal activity.
[01:26:34.318 --> 01:26:36.459]  And they're covering, and they're lying about it.
[01:26:36.559 --> 01:26:42.301]  They're impeaching their credibility when they put out this garbage press release saying that they were playing me.
[01:26:42.321 --> 01:26:46.983]  I mean, that is the worst cover-your-ass excuse I've ever seen.
[01:26:47.003 --> 01:26:51.865]  If you're gonna counter-sting, I'm in the business of stinging people, investigating, going undercover.
[01:26:52.325 --> 01:26:58.649]  If you're going to counter-stink someone, and you're going to do a conspiracy to do it, it would be on one email.
[01:26:59.170 --> 01:27:00.390]  We have all their emails.
[01:27:00.871 --> 01:27:06.695]  And they continue to CC our undercover reporters, even up to the moment this video was released.
[01:27:07.215 --> 01:27:13.139]  A month later, they were CCing our undercover reporters about all their specific plans.
[01:27:13.759 --> 01:27:26.428]  So, this notion that they're counter-stinging me, or that I'm inciting the violence, is rubbish, and it's laughable that the media's falling for it, but what do we expect?
[01:27:26.448 --> 01:27:31.452]  That's why I gotta fight them back by dripping out videos until they're shamed into covering it.
[01:27:32.493 --> 01:27:35.255]  I think things are going to change with the new Attorney General.
[01:27:35.375 --> 01:27:49.086]  I think Senator Sessions, when he becomes Attorney General, is going to have a very different approach to this than we've seen from Eric Holder and from Loretta Lynch, who basically have looked the other way as we see these acts happen.
[01:27:49.126 --> 01:27:52.228]  I mean, they looked the other way when we had video that exposed
[01:27:53.649 --> 01:27:58.350]  The new Black Panthers, intimidating people at voting booths.
[01:27:59.571 --> 01:28:03.292]  Their investigation into crimes is unbelievably political.
[01:28:03.692 --> 01:28:11.674]  But I think they're going to take this very seriously in the next administration, which will only be a short time after these events that they're planning.
[01:28:11.754 --> 01:28:15.795]  So I think it's going to be a very dangerous thing for them to continue to go ahead with these events.
[01:28:16.835 --> 01:28:19.919]  You exposing this will stop these things from happening.
[01:28:19.939 --> 01:28:23.103]  But still, for them to plan it is a crime.
[01:28:23.243 --> 01:28:26.667]  To conspire to commit a crime is a crime in and of itself.
[01:28:26.767 --> 01:28:27.388]  It's very important.
[01:28:28.032 --> 01:28:31.973]  It's very important and I don't think they're going to stop doing it.
[01:28:32.073 --> 01:28:41.354]  I think they are immune from accountability and there's a hubris because they've been getting away with it for years.
[01:28:41.394 --> 01:28:46.395]  I mean, I've spent years under the thumb of my government.
[01:28:47.015 --> 01:28:48.876]  I have been mistreated by my government.
[01:28:48.976 --> 01:28:50.436]  I have been subpoenaed.
[01:28:50.916 --> 01:28:53.256]  I have been issued criminal grand jury subpoenas.
[01:28:53.296 --> 01:28:54.276]  I've been investigated.
[01:28:54.316 --> 01:28:57.257]  I've been sent to prison for bringing a camera
[01:28:57.697 --> 01:28:58.058]  Yeah.
[01:28:58.078 --> 01:28:58.158]  Yeah.
[01:29:15.055 --> 01:29:16.616]  I still have to fight an uphill battle.
[01:29:17.216 --> 01:29:29.442]  And as long as I have to do that, we have to play these games, which I shouldn't have to play, where when they issue a response, I have to issue a little bit of information, trickling it out, showing they lied about that.
[01:29:29.882 --> 01:29:31.923]  This is what we have to do and we're going to continue to do it.
[01:29:32.243 --> 01:29:34.764]  Look at the video, it's out in a few minutes on Project Veritas.
[01:29:34.804 --> 01:29:37.285]  I know you've got to go soon.
[01:29:37.885 --> 01:29:39.726]  Can you stay with us a little bit into the next segment?
[01:29:39.786 --> 01:29:40.026]  I can't.
[01:29:40.066 --> 01:29:42.367]  I've got to run because I've got to get this video out.
[01:29:42.427 --> 01:29:43.287]  Alright, I understand.
[01:29:43.467 --> 01:29:44.507]  So you can look at that video.
[01:29:44.527 --> 01:29:46.348]  You can find that at projectbertos.com.
[01:29:46.368 --> 01:29:47.348]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:29:47.408 --> 01:29:48.749]  James O'Keefe, we'll be right back.
[01:30:00.168 --> 01:30:06.318]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[01:30:06.879 --> 01:30:08.281]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[01:30:09.198 --> 01:30:11.059]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[01:30:11.679 --> 01:30:17.243]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[01:30:17.823 --> 01:30:25.808]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[01:30:25.828 --> 01:30:28.289]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[01:30:28.589 --> 01:30:29.790]  This is the best system out there.
[01:30:30.050 --> 01:30:32.812]  And we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[01:30:33.072 --> 01:30:33.813]  This is how it works.
[01:30:34.093 --> 01:30:34.613]  You order.
[01:30:34.733 --> 01:30:35.534]  Customized or
[01:30:36.630 --> 01:30:38.091]  Straight from the factory, however you want it.
[01:30:38.571 --> 01:30:46.076]  It is shipped on the next business day to you and your family, and a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this republic.
[01:30:46.296 --> 01:30:47.076]  You cannot lose.
[01:30:47.116 --> 01:30:48.217]  You're funding the InfoWar.

[01:31:03.066 --> 01:31:06.467]  We've had some of the biggest sales in our history since Christmas into the new year.
[01:31:06.768 --> 01:31:12.750]  I'm extending them as the inauguration specials right through this weekend, and then it's over.
[01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:19.393]  We have some new products coming out next week, some other sales we're going to be doing, but many of these sales are going to have to come to an end.
[01:31:19.413 --> 01:31:28.097]  If you want, across the board, massive specials on hundreds and hundreds of items, like Rain Force, 30% off, and they're 20% more in each bottle.
[01:31:28.157 --> 01:31:30.078]  Supernova Vitality, 30% off.

[01:31:31.939 --> 01:31:32.659]  Here's the bottom line.
[01:31:32.739 --> 01:31:36.462]  These are great products that changed my life and changed some of the other people's lives.
[01:31:36.642 --> 01:31:38.444]  Also, it funds the operation.
[01:31:38.624 --> 01:31:44.268]  This sale ends this weekend after the inauguration of Donald J. Trump as the 45th president.
[01:31:44.368 --> 01:31:49.272]  Infowarsstore.com or Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:31:49.332 --> 01:31:57.279]  You get great products, help fund the Infowar, and celebrate the election of a populist, a champion against the New World Order.
[01:31:57.459 --> 01:31:59.321]  I'm Alex Jones and this is the Infowar.
[01:32:00.121 --> 01:32:01.541]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:32:01.702 --> 01:32:04.122]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to secure your chemistry.
[01:32:04.302 --> 01:32:11.604]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.

[01:32:22.447 --> 01:32:30.030]  In the history of InfoWars Live, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality, and so many others.
[01:32:30.270 --> 01:32:40.234]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[01:32:40.474 --> 01:32:42.435]  And this part is most important.
[01:32:42.535 --> 01:32:48.958]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[01:32:49.338 --> 01:32:50.440]  That means it's clean.
[01:32:50.780 --> 01:32:51.702]  That means it's pure.
[01:32:51.902 --> 01:32:54.706]  And rest secured, you're finding the tip of the spear in the Infowar.
[01:32:54.806 --> 01:32:57.570]  That's Infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:32:57.610 --> 01:32:59.272]  Take action now before we sell out.
[01:33:02.937 --> 01:33:05.841]  I think that there's no question that the process...
[01:33:20.202 --> 01:33:20.343]  I'm 1776!
[01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:28.701]  Can you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones?
[01:33:28.821 --> 01:33:30.521]  Move, bitch!
[01:33:30.741 --> 01:33:31.901]  Get out the way!
[01:33:33.582 --> 01:33:39.623]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag.
[01:33:39.783 --> 01:33:43.884]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[01:33:44.024 --> 01:33:47.565]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[01:33:47.705 --> 01:33:49.105]  I will not let you down.
[01:33:49.165 --> 01:33:52.086]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:33:52.306 --> 01:33:53.506]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[01:33:55.126 --> 01:33:56.587]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[01:33:56.607 --> 01:34:01.469]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[01:34:01.629 --> 01:34:03.729]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:34:04.250 --> 01:34:05.350]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:34:06.771 --> 01:34:08.151]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:34:08.211 --> 01:34:19.515]  I'm David Knight and just a reminder that Alex Jones is going to be here in the studio in one hour with a huge announcement, as he said, concerning attacks of a lethal nature surrounding the Trump inauguration.
[01:34:20.350 --> 01:34:24.774]  I want to take a look at the toxic rhetoric that is coming out.
[01:34:24.814 --> 01:34:34.182]  We were just talking to James O'Keefe and he was talking about the undercover investigation that showed that they have people in Washington, as we've talked about, people like Bill Ayers and others.
[01:34:35.482 --> 01:34:45.125]  The Communist Party leaders who are pushing to agitate to disrupt paid protesters that are being solicited in 20 different cities to go to Washington.
[01:34:45.165 --> 01:34:46.205]  They want to block traffic.
[01:34:46.606 --> 01:34:47.746]  They want to stop chains.
[01:34:47.806 --> 01:34:53.748]  As he's pointing out, this second video in their undercover investigation shows that they're going to be trying to
[01:34:56.250 --> 01:35:07.723]  I guess maybe that's kind of a picture of what Obama's been doing to the economy, with his last-minute regulations especially, trying to chain us so that we can't move, we can't do anything.
[01:35:07.763 --> 01:35:08.644]  But it's quite dangerous.
[01:35:08.704 --> 01:35:14.450]  And what they're talking about doing at the DePauw Ball, in that first part of the report that we saw yesterday,
[01:35:15.171 --> 01:35:16.992]  They were talking about how they wanted to panic people.
[01:35:17.052 --> 01:35:26.799]  They wanted to create a panic at the Deplora Ball with this butyric acid in the ventilation system, trying to get a stampede of people out of that building.
[01:35:27.259 --> 01:35:44.410]  You know, I talked two days ago about how in Germany, a court there said that it wasn't really anti-Semitism, it wasn't a hate crime, and you know, hey, it's a little bit of arson, but you know, we'll protect that as free speech because you set this, you had a bunch of Arabs who got drunk and set a synagogue on fire.
[01:35:45.123 --> 01:35:45.964]  And they said that's okay.
[01:35:46.444 --> 01:35:51.707]  They were upset about Israel's foreign policy, so it's okay to try to burn down a synagogue.
[01:35:52.027 --> 01:35:54.228]  And if anybody's in there, sorry about that, you know.
[01:35:55.149 --> 01:35:56.830]  If it spreads to other places, sorry.
[01:35:57.670 --> 01:36:00.512]  If it injures German firefighters, try to put that, that's okay.
[01:36:00.532 --> 01:36:02.473]  They were just expressing their opinion about Israel.
[01:36:03.014 --> 01:36:10.138]  And as one member of parliament there said, these people, these German Jews who are going to the synagogue, they don't have anything to do with Israeli foreign policy.
[01:36:11.058 --> 01:36:13.639]  Neither do the firemen who would get injured putting out that arson.
[01:36:13.659 --> 01:36:18.281]  So, yes, it was hate speech, it was anti-Semitism, and it was arson.
[01:36:19.242 --> 01:36:26.385]  But of course, they said that was fine, and yet at the same time that it's happening, you've got Angela Merkel saying, we're going to go after people on social media.
[01:36:26.846 --> 01:36:29.747]  We don't want any of that hateful stuff that you people are saying on social media.
[01:36:29.787 --> 01:36:38.251]  We are going to be the arbiters of whatever you're saying, whether it's true, whether it's hateful, and we're going to decide that we're going to come after you because we cannot allow that to happen.
[01:36:38.291 --> 01:36:40.152]  See what they're concerned about.
[01:36:41.269 --> 01:36:41.349]  Yes.
[01:37:11.348 --> 01:37:17.921]  No, the thing that is dangerous to them is anybody that opposes their politics, that opposes their political party.
[01:37:18.462 --> 01:37:20.366]  That's the danger that they're concerned about.
[01:37:20.386 --> 01:37:21.629]  Want to set buildings on fire?
[01:37:21.649 --> 01:37:22.210]  We don't care.
[01:37:23.049 --> 01:37:26.331]  You want to shoot people in the streets, run them down with big semi-trailers?
[01:37:26.471 --> 01:37:27.051]  We don't care.
[01:37:27.511 --> 01:37:28.712]  You want to criticize the government?
[01:37:29.052 --> 01:37:29.893]  Ah, we care.
[01:37:30.393 --> 01:37:31.393]  We care a lot about that.
[01:37:31.414 --> 01:37:33.635]  And we're going to come down with a hammer on you about that.
[01:37:33.655 --> 01:37:36.456]  Now we're going to talk about this whole Russia narrative.
[01:37:36.956 --> 01:37:39.738]  We've got a couple of interesting video clips with this as well.
[01:37:39.758 --> 01:37:41.919]  I'm going to start with Al Sharpton here in just a moment.
[01:37:41.959 --> 01:37:50.384]  But before we do, I want to remind you that the sale that we put on at the beginning of the year to help you start with new habits in a new year, make yourself

[01:38:01.355 --> 01:38:03.016]  It's going to be ending the end of this week.

[01:38:22.727 --> 01:38:23.647]  Okay?
[01:38:23.667 --> 01:38:27.108]  You don't want to get the vitamin B injections, probably.
[01:38:27.268 --> 01:38:28.748]  Who likes to get a shot, right?
[01:38:28.868 --> 01:38:34.770]  But you can take this very easily, orally, and it's just as effective as getting a shot.

[01:38:48.434 --> 01:38:51.215]  And many others you'll find at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:38:51.235 --> 01:38:54.296]  Those sales are about to end at the end of this week.
[01:38:55.457 --> 01:38:57.898]  I want to play Al Sharpton in his comments.
[01:38:57.938 --> 01:39:01.379]  Again, pushing this idea, like we saw with John Lewis.
[01:39:02.438 --> 01:39:06.120]  We've got all these black leaders coming out now because it's Martin Luther King Day yesterday.
[01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:11.264]  And so you have all these black leaders saying Donald Trump is not legitimate.
[01:39:12.024 --> 01:39:13.865]  And we are not going to go to the inauguration.
[01:39:13.885 --> 01:39:15.286]  It's like, fine, don't go.
[01:39:16.147 --> 01:39:18.568]  But not legitimate?
[01:39:18.608 --> 01:39:22.431]  Here's Al Sharpton to tell us what's legitimate and what's not legitimate.
[01:39:24.091 --> 01:39:29.274]  I think that there's no question that the process that elected him was not legitimate.
[01:39:29.714 --> 01:39:42.942]  When you look at the now evidence from the intelligence agencies that there was the influence from the Russians, clearly the process has serious questions about it.
[01:39:43.842 --> 01:39:45.203]  All that influence from the Russians.
[01:39:45.663 --> 01:39:48.946]  Yeah, you know, and of course that's Al Sharpton, an unimpeachable source of integrity.
[01:39:49.667 --> 01:39:52.970]  The guy who was behind the Tawana Brawley fraud, okay?
[01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:53.951]  Made a lot of money with that.
[01:39:54.732 --> 01:39:57.515]  He's lost a lot of weight, he hasn't gained any credibility, okay?
[01:39:57.695 --> 01:40:08.025]  And then we got John Lewis, a guy who did some important things in the civil rights movement, and then of course remember that when John Lewis calls Donald Trump illegitimate,
[01:40:08.888 --> 01:40:13.014]  He also said John McCain and Sarah Palin were another George Wallace.
[01:40:13.034 --> 01:40:15.898]  He said the same thing about Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan.
[01:40:15.938 --> 01:40:17.480]  They're another George Wallace.
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:19.343]  These are racist people, okay?
[01:40:19.363 --> 01:40:23.148]  So he's, you kind of get the idea that he's now become a partisan hack?
[01:40:23.894 --> 01:40:24.715]  As a member of Congress?
[01:40:24.735 --> 01:40:28.837]  You know, what happened to civil rights 50-55 years ago, when he was involved?
[01:40:29.137 --> 01:40:30.498]  What has he been doing for the last 30 years?
[01:40:30.898 --> 01:40:32.039]  He has been a political hack.
[01:40:32.279 --> 01:40:36.842]  And not even just against Democrats, against Republicans, but against some of his own fellow Democrats.
[01:40:36.882 --> 01:40:38.583]  There he is, with Hillary Clinton.
[01:40:39.043 --> 01:40:47.769]  Because remember, that in the primary, it was John Lewis who said, Bernie Sanders, he never did anything in the civil rights movement.
[01:40:48.513 --> 01:40:52.257]  Bernie Sanders then put out pictures showing him involved in the Civil Rights Movement.
[01:40:52.277 --> 01:40:53.579]  But do you see any criticisms?
[01:40:53.619 --> 01:41:09.057]  As I pointed out last night in the nightly news, did you ever see any criticisms of John Lewis, of people like Morris Deese, who was involved in the Civil Rights Movement, on the side of the Ku Klux Klan, defending them, then became the CEO and the founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center?
[01:41:09.617 --> 01:41:11.379]  To make a lot of money, to profit off of it.
[01:41:11.519 --> 01:41:26.893]  The only thing he did in the Civil Rights Movement, the guy with the Southern Poverty Law Center, the SPLC, the people that are the go-to Bible for the FBI, for the federal agencies, for the mainstream media, and fingering people and saying, these people are racist, these people are hate mongers, okay?
[01:41:27.762 --> 01:41:44.493]  Those people, all they did during the Civil Rights Movement was defend the Ku Klux Klan and then set the rest of it out while he was out making a fistful of money with a direct mail campaign and then he started using Southern Poverty Law Center as a direct mail fundraiser.
[01:41:45.013 --> 01:41:45.534]  Funny, yeah.
[01:41:45.754 --> 01:41:46.234]  Funny money.
[01:41:47.215 --> 01:41:48.276]  That's where these guys have hung out.
[01:41:48.316 --> 01:41:52.518]  Did you ever see John Lewis complain about him or complain about
[01:41:53.945 --> 01:42:05.994]  These other people that were in the Democrat Party and just switched sides, like Robert Byrd, who was high up in the KKK and then he becomes a high leader in the Senate.
[01:42:06.014 --> 01:42:07.055]  They don't have any problem with him.
[01:42:07.075 --> 01:42:08.796]  Bill and Hillary don't have any problem with him.
[01:42:08.836 --> 01:42:16.883]  So Bernie Sanders understands that these guys, people like John Lewis, hacked the Democrat primary against him.
[01:42:17.833 --> 01:42:23.757]  And we've got the emails showing that Hillary was conspiring with the DNC, with the mainstream media, against Bernie Sanders.
[01:42:23.777 --> 01:42:27.539]  At the same time, you've got this political hack, John Lewis, saying, Bernie Sanders?
[01:42:27.579 --> 01:42:30.241]  I never saw him in the civil rights movement.
[01:42:30.261 --> 01:42:36.605]  But let's take a look at what's going on with this Russian narrative that these guys are also pushing at the same time.
[01:42:37.606 --> 01:42:41.128]  There is a BBC documentary that is coming out.
[01:42:42.043 --> 01:42:46.026]  And it's being put out by a program on the BBC called Panorama.
[01:42:46.926 --> 01:42:59.635]  And before I play that for you, I just want to, there's also a report from The Guardian, where Vladimir Putin has commented for the first time, making his first public remarks on these claims about the dirty dossier and these other things.
[01:42:59.675 --> 01:43:05.098]  He said those behind Trump's dossier are, quote, worse than prostitutes.
[01:43:05.999 --> 01:43:09.260]  And this is what Putin said about Donald Trump in his public remarks.
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:14.662]  He said that the idea that Trump was essentially a Russian intelligence asset was nonsense.
[01:43:14.702 --> 01:43:16.202]  He said, quote, I've never met him.
[01:43:16.862 --> 01:43:21.504]  I don't know what he'll do on the world stage, so I have no reason either to criticize him or to defend him.
[01:43:22.024 --> 01:43:28.566]  But he goes, this is an adult man and a man who for years organized beauty contests, spoke with most beautiful women in the world.
[01:43:28.606 --> 01:43:32.747]  I can hardly believe that he ran off to meet with our girls of low social morals.
[01:43:33.067 --> 01:43:35.428]  Although, of course, ours are the best in the world.
[01:43:37.447 --> 01:43:41.688]  Oh yeah, he wouldn't do anything with a prostitute, but of course we have the best looking prostitutes in the world, according to Putin.
[01:43:42.128 --> 01:43:51.590]  Then he goes on to say, the people who order these fakes, which are being spread against the President-elect of America, and use them in a political battle, are worse than prostitutes.
[01:43:51.690 --> 01:43:53.291]  They have no moral limits.
[01:43:54.051 --> 01:43:59.872]  Alright, so with that in mind, let's take a look at how the BBC is prostituting itself on this program, Panorama.
[01:43:59.932 --> 01:44:01.133]  And remember, it was the BBC
[01:44:02.373 --> 01:44:21.336]  That after things came to light with Jimmy Savile, remember the lifelong pedophile who was connected to the royal family, who was connected to all the UK elites, and as Alex Jones pointed out, David Icke would come on the program and start to talk about Jimmy Savile and go, you know, don't want to get into a lawsuit here or things that we can't prove.
[01:44:21.376 --> 01:44:22.877]  Well, it was proven after he died.
[01:44:23.337 --> 01:44:30.098]  The BBC even did a documentary on it at the middle level and of course the BBC higher-ups spiked that documentary.
[01:44:30.794 --> 01:44:36.902]  There were multiple investigations that have been started during Jimmy Savile's lifetime by Scotland Yard, the people lower down.
[01:44:37.062 --> 01:44:38.464]  But again, compartmentalization, right?
[01:44:38.484 --> 01:44:46.133]  They didn't know that he was a protected individual until people higher up in Scotland Yard shut down the investigation.
[01:44:46.994 --> 01:44:53.256]  So, with that in mind, I want to play for you a little bit of this video trailer, and it's called Donald Trump.
[01:44:53.376 --> 01:44:57.498]  They talk about Donald Trump and they put him out there as, quote-unquote, the Kremlin candidate.
[01:44:57.518 --> 01:45:01.199]  That's actually the name of their so-called documentary.
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:09.002]  Was Donald Trump helped into the White House by Vladimir Putin?
[01:45:10.183 --> 01:45:15.487]  This is clearly the most serious blow to our democratic system since Watergate.
[01:45:15.948 --> 01:45:20.311]  A spy on the run, honey trap, cyber war, the Kremlin has formed.
[01:45:20.832 --> 01:45:21.212]  Russia?
[01:45:21.572 --> 01:45:23.053]  They do this like bread and butter.
[01:45:23.253 --> 01:45:24.795]  It is part of their being.
[01:45:25.315 --> 01:45:28.017]  Trump denies everything and blames the CIA.
[01:45:29.578 --> 01:45:32.922]  That's something that Nazi Germany would have done and didn't do.
[01:45:33.963 --> 01:45:38.868]  As he's about to take office, we ask, what does the transatlantic romance mean for us?
[01:45:39.148 --> 01:45:39.769]  Oh, disgusting.
[01:45:39.789 --> 01:45:42.371]  It's not going to be business as usual.
[01:45:42.732 --> 01:45:47.757]  And what happens if the two leaders fall out with a bit of a firefight behind us?
[01:45:51.463 --> 01:45:54.446]  And of course, as you saw in that clip, they show a picture of Nigel Farage.
[01:45:54.466 --> 01:45:57.208]  They're trying to tarnish Nigel Farage.
[01:45:57.248 --> 01:46:03.233]  They're going to imply that, oh, he's part of this Russian honey trap or this Russian conspiracy as well.
[01:46:04.264 --> 01:46:09.987]  Now there's an article from the Express in the UK pushing back against this.
[01:46:10.627 --> 01:46:17.490]  They said the BBC and fresh bias row as Panorama brands Donald Trump the Kremlin candidate.
[01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:24.553]  They said the BBC is facing fresh accusations of bias after this documentary labeling Donald Trump as a Kremlin candidate.
[01:46:24.593 --> 01:46:28.895]  And of course that is to refer to the Manchurian candidate.
[01:46:28.915 --> 01:46:32.397]  We've had that narrative being sold to us by multiple mainstream medias
[01:46:33.717 --> 01:46:36.498]  ...organizations this last week here in the United States.
[01:46:36.778 --> 01:46:40.559]  Interesting, isn't it, how all these things come together at the same time?
[01:46:40.959 --> 01:46:44.640]  And I want to read you some of the quotes that people have responded to here.
[01:46:44.660 --> 01:46:46.241]  And these are people in the UK.
[01:46:46.281 --> 01:46:47.601]  This is a UK article.
[01:46:48.261 --> 01:46:55.123]  They say, one furious viewer tweeted, I don't like Trump, but this fanatical anti-Russian propaganda is stupid.
[01:46:55.163 --> 01:46:57.344]  Hillary lost because a lot of people hate her.
[01:46:58.004 --> 01:47:01.207]  Another one said, Panorama or Propaganda?
[01:47:01.728 --> 01:47:03.790]  Why do I have to pay for your BS?
[01:47:03.870 --> 01:47:09.416]  Because in the UK you are forced to pay for the BBC in a very open way.
[01:47:09.456 --> 01:47:12.719]  Here we subsidize NPR in a little bit more indirect way.
[01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:14.841]  So you don't see it directly.
[01:47:14.901 --> 01:47:19.226]  And you don't see the subsidies that go to so many of the mainstream media outlets either.
[01:47:19.266 --> 01:47:21.028]  They bury those things there.
[01:47:21.808 --> 01:47:23.649]  Another wrote, the world is changing.
[01:47:24.109 --> 01:47:28.772]  You've had your time, BBC, and the people are seeing through your illiberal bias.
[01:47:29.592 --> 01:47:32.393]  But you know, there actually may be something to this.
[01:47:32.433 --> 01:47:40.837]  We actually have a clip here of a Russian hacker who has admitted that Putin hacked Trump.
[01:47:41.518 --> 01:47:42.018]  Here's that clip.
[01:47:45.612 --> 01:47:47.594]  Here we are, the Russian hackers.
[01:47:47.754 --> 01:47:48.594]  Russian hackers.
[01:47:48.795 --> 01:47:49.575]  Russian hack.
[01:47:49.676 --> 01:47:50.316]  Russian hacking.
[01:47:50.356 --> 01:47:51.137]  Russian hacking.
[01:47:51.197 --> 01:47:51.858]  Russian hackers.
[01:47:51.998 --> 01:48:00.406]  We're going to tell you the whole truth because from now you, the dear CIA, NSA, and FBI won't be able to do anything about it.
[01:48:00.566 --> 01:48:00.926]  I won!
[01:48:01.907 --> 01:48:03.048]  I mean, I became president.
[01:48:03.428 --> 01:48:04.849]  Nice try with the report.
[01:48:04.929 --> 01:48:07.071]  Total disaster.
[01:48:07.211 --> 01:48:09.712]  But you failed to find the most important element.
[01:48:09.972 --> 01:48:13.235]  We don't need to hack Trump's Twitter, as CNN suggests.
[01:48:13.795 --> 01:48:14.796]  You are fake news.
[01:48:15.276 --> 01:48:17.037]  We hacked Donald Trump himself.
[01:48:18.058 --> 01:48:22.160]  Do you remember him praising Putin for more implementing counterventions?
[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:24.662]  That was Putin praising himself with Trump's hands.
[01:48:26.693 --> 01:48:30.094]  Every American politician knows the more sanctions, the better.
[01:48:30.274 --> 01:48:30.934]  New sanctions.
[01:48:30.954 --> 01:48:32.134]  Additional sanctions.
[01:48:32.354 --> 01:48:33.755]  Increases in sanctions.
[01:48:33.775 --> 01:48:35.875]  So, now, crop is ours.
[01:48:36.175 --> 01:48:40.076]  As soon as your president does something you don't like, you'll shout, Russian hackers!
[01:48:40.236 --> 01:48:41.756]  Boy, oh boy, oh boy!
[01:48:42.216 --> 01:48:46.197]  And you, the guys in intelligence, you still haven't discovered the main thing.
[01:48:47.497 --> 01:48:53.879]  How did we manage to hack more than 60 million Americans who simply chose to kick out the establishment?
[01:48:55.319 --> 01:49:03.046]  A little parody piece there from RT, and the person you see behind the mask, he takes off that mask and goes, well, how do we manage to convince all these people?
[01:49:03.066 --> 01:49:13.837]  And of course, RT was figured prominently at the center of this fake intelligence report, even going back and saying, look at these programs going back to 2012.
[01:49:14.237 --> 01:49:17.600]  Look, they were involved in criticizing Barack Obama.
[01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:20.383]  Well, they didn't have an effect then, did they?
[01:49:20.863 --> 01:49:26.304]  And they talked about programs that haven't been in existence for several years at RT.
[01:49:26.344 --> 01:49:29.505]  This is the kind of narrative that we see continually being put out there.
[01:49:29.885 --> 01:49:36.566]  And yet at the same time, there is some Russian hacking involved with the Democrats that you haven't really heard about.
[01:49:37.046 --> 01:49:44.648]  And this is something I've alluded to a couple of times, but I want to get down into it and tell you exactly what happened when we come back in the next segment.
[01:49:44.668 --> 01:49:46.468]  I don't have enough time to talk about it this segment.
[01:49:47.455 --> 01:49:55.821]  But this is a report that was put out by Politico, and only a few conservative news outlets have picked up on this detailed report from Politico.
[01:49:55.861 --> 01:50:04.808]  Now, of course, they talk about Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Donald Trump, to work with the Democrat National Committee to sabotage Donald Trump.
[01:50:05.865 --> 01:50:15.709]  But they do it in a way, and of course they kind of backpedal, being Politico, and these are the people, here's a recent headline from Politico, Trump and the world readies for a leap into darkness.
[01:50:16.169 --> 01:50:16.449]  Okay?
[01:50:16.829 --> 01:50:19.030]  This is their perspective on the inauguration.
[01:50:19.050 --> 01:50:27.634]  So you know where Politico is coming from, even if you haven't been to their site and see the biased news, very biased site, very leftist site.
[01:50:28.274 --> 01:50:41.769]  But they reported on this and I think it's kind of interesting that it was coming from Politico because it looks like they're trying to get out ahead of this and put a positive spin on this before other people focus on what's been discovered.
[01:50:41.809 --> 01:50:45.533]  But we're going to talk about that and we're going to take their spin off of it when we come back.
[01:50:45.613 --> 01:50:46.014]  Stay with us.
[01:51:04.082 --> 01:51:14.566]  Lauren Southern, commentator at TheRebel.media, author of the new book, Barbarians, How Baby Boomers, Immigrants, and Islam Screwed My Generation.
[01:51:15.046 --> 01:51:15.927]  Lauren, welcome back.
[01:51:16.347 --> 01:51:17.287]  Thanks for having me, Paul.
[01:51:17.647 --> 01:51:32.173]  This white, mentally disabled teen, again, abducted for two days, tortured, beaten, humiliated, forced to drink toilet water, racially abused, as it was all live-streamed on Facebook.
[01:51:32.813 --> 01:51:34.135]  But I mean, Lauren, he's white.
[01:51:34.756 --> 01:51:36.839]  He had institutional power.
[01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:38.722]  So it can't be racist, right?
[01:51:39.781 --> 01:51:40.581]  Of course not.
[01:51:41.101 --> 01:51:42.622]  It's really amazing.
[01:51:42.702 --> 01:51:48.783]  We're starting out 2017 as many of us expected it would start out with once again proving it was fake news.
[01:51:48.883 --> 01:51:50.363]  They said Donald Trump wouldn't win.
[01:51:50.383 --> 01:52:03.826]  Then when he did win they said that this year would be the year that we would see a huge rise in hate crime against minorities and that the Trump camp would be invigorated by his hate speech and supremacy and just
[01:52:04.786 --> 01:52:09.471]  Massive Hitler nation against blacks and Mexicans.
[01:52:09.852 --> 01:52:11.233]  But no, what did we see instead?
[01:52:11.253 --> 01:52:13.335]  We saw a wave of fake hate crimes.
[01:52:13.475 --> 01:52:20.943]  And now to start off 2017, a white disabled man being kidnapped by blacks and being tortured.
[01:52:21.523 --> 01:52:22.283]  What are they going to do?
[01:52:22.343 --> 01:52:23.344]  What are they going to run with?
[01:52:24.464 --> 01:52:28.766]  CNN has gone and said, these are just troubled kids.
[01:52:28.846 --> 01:52:33.168]  Even the sheriff has said, these are, you know, kids will be kids, boys will be boys.
[01:52:33.549 --> 01:52:34.789]  I mean, I remember being a kid.
[01:52:34.829 --> 01:52:39.831]  Maybe the worst thing I did was stand outside a liquor store and ask someone to buy me booze.
[01:52:39.891 --> 01:52:43.853]  But I don't quite remember kidnapping an Asian family and torturing them.
[01:52:44.333 --> 01:52:46.734]  This isn't a kids will be kids situation.
[01:52:46.955 --> 01:52:50.196]  Who really has the institutional power when they can
[01:52:53.459 --> 01:53:04.247]  This idea that anti-white racism and it being acceptable to be anti-white is now not only acceptable, but thanks to BuzzFeed, thanks to MTV, it's kinda cute!
[01:53:04.868 --> 01:53:07.650]  How much blame do you apportion to that kind of cultural meme?
[01:53:08.070 --> 01:53:09.210]  Where do you think they're learning this?
[01:53:09.250 --> 01:53:13.932]  They're learning it from the Kardashians, they're learning it in their classrooms, they're learning it from BuzzFeed.
[01:53:13.972 --> 01:53:17.172]  It is totally a cultural thing and none of it is unique.
[01:53:17.312 --> 01:53:19.213]  All these people are conformists.
[01:53:19.313 --> 01:53:20.953]  It's an ideology of conformity.
[01:53:20.973 --> 01:53:26.875]  They have no individual personalities, no ability to question and see the nuance in the fact that
[01:53:27.435 --> 01:53:56.995]  Maybe white privilege doesn't exist when a white guy can be special needs and get beat up and scalped and choked and they can't see that nuance because it's all a young generation of conformity and they have conformed to the worst aspects of our culture and that's what happens when parents say just let your kids uh don't don't give your kids any ideology let the culture dictate that well they adopt what the modern culture is and our modern culture is quite frankly cancerous right now.
[01:54:12.853 --> 01:54:14.174]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:14.214 --> 01:54:14.815]  I'm David Knight.
[01:54:15.415 --> 01:54:17.036]  Alex Jones is in the building.
[01:54:17.076 --> 01:54:19.318]  He will be taking the next hour.
[01:54:19.398 --> 01:54:29.466]  He has a very important announcement that he's going to be making at the bottom of the next hour, but he will be taking the show over in the next, after the top of the hour.
[01:54:30.947 --> 01:54:37.532]  This segment I want to finish up on what I was talking about with Ukraine, because I think what we see here from this Politico article that came out on the 11th,
[01:54:38.894 --> 01:54:45.485]  It's really an attempt for them to get ahead of the story, to put a spin on this for the Democrats, because that's where Politico has hung out.
[01:54:45.926 --> 01:54:51.075]  And what they talk about with this is Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump have actually backfired.
[01:54:51.761 --> 01:55:04.046]  And of course, they're saying this is going to make it very difficult for Ukrainians to get any influence in the Trump administration, just as we see reports that these never-Trumpers are saying, hey, we're available if you want us for jobs in Washington.
[01:55:04.106 --> 01:55:06.127]  It's like, no, I don't think so.
[01:55:06.287 --> 01:55:06.827]  I don't think so.
[01:55:06.847 --> 01:55:07.968]  We're not too interested.
[01:55:08.028 --> 01:55:09.869]  Well, it looks like they have kind of
[01:55:11.195 --> 01:55:15.658]  Damage themselves, but I want you to see how this developed.
[01:55:16.138 --> 01:55:29.887]  And they point out a Ukrainian American operative who was a consultant for the Democrat National Committee met with top officials in the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington in an effort to expose ties between Trump, Paul Manafort, and Russia.
[01:55:30.607 --> 01:55:31.708]  Now remember at the same time,
[01:55:32.864 --> 01:55:37.766]  John Podesta's brother was heavily involved in the lobbyist firm, and of course John Podesta and his brother lived together.
[01:55:37.786 --> 01:55:46.390]  They're very close, and there are connections on the Podesta side to Russia as well, but those were never talked about by the mainstream media, were they?
[01:55:46.490 --> 01:55:50.472]  So they wanted to try to focus this and create a situation with Paul Manafort and Russia
[01:55:51.232 --> 01:55:51.952]  Against Trump.
[01:55:51.992 --> 01:55:53.933]  They say Ukrainian efforts had an impact in the race.
[01:55:54.513 --> 01:55:56.673]  They helped to force Manafort's resignation.
[01:55:57.134 --> 01:56:03.075]  They advanced the narrative that Trump's campaign was deeply connected to Ukrainian foe to the east, Russia.
[01:56:03.935 --> 01:56:12.057]  And then they go through and they talk about, well, you know, we've seen that James Clapper and the intelligence community have proven that there were direct efforts by Vladimir Putin.
[01:56:12.077 --> 01:56:14.138]  Because remember, this is Politico.
[01:56:14.358 --> 01:56:17.419]  And then they say, but there's little evidence of such a top-down effort by Ukraine.
[01:56:17.639 --> 01:56:17.879]  Really?
[01:56:18.359 --> 01:56:18.539]  Okay.
[01:56:19.219 --> 01:56:21.342]  Well, let's go through and see exactly what happened.
[01:56:21.362 --> 01:56:33.637]  They say, nevertheless, Politico's investigation found evidence of Ukrainian government involvement in the race that appears to strain diplomatic protocol that dictates that governments refrain from engaging in each other's elections.
[01:56:33.738 --> 01:56:34.939]  So, they admit...
[01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:44.266]  That the Ukrainian government, with this Ukrainian-American, working as a longtime consultant for the Democrat National Committee.
[01:56:44.287 --> 01:56:46.808]  She worked there from 2004 to 2016.
[01:56:47.109 --> 01:56:49.370]  Her name is Alexandra Chalupa.
[01:56:50.111 --> 01:56:55.215]  She worked at the White House Office of Public Liaison during the Clinton administration, then worked for the DNC.
[01:56:55.255 --> 01:57:00.519]  So she's got Clinton credentials, she's got DNC credentials for 12 years, and she's a Ukrainian.
[01:57:00.559 --> 01:57:03.061]  She goes with the Ukrainian embassy.
[01:57:03.721 --> 01:57:04.581]  We're good to go.
[01:57:24.951 --> 01:57:27.292]  Are really the fountainhead of this report.
[01:57:27.332 --> 01:57:28.553]  That's the thing that you need to understand.
[01:57:28.793 --> 01:57:30.394]  They say she occasionally shared her findings.
[01:57:30.594 --> 01:57:31.034]  Occasionally.
[01:57:31.294 --> 01:57:34.536]  Occasionally shared her findings with officials from the DNC and Clinton campaign.
[01:57:34.556 --> 01:57:34.976]  Of course she did.
[01:57:34.996 --> 01:57:38.778]  She's worked for the DNC and Clinton for years and years.
[01:57:38.838 --> 01:57:46.362]  Chalupa told a senior DNC official that when it came to the Trump campaign she said, I felt, I felt there was a Russian connection.
[01:57:47.082 --> 01:57:49.183]  That's what we got from the Intelligence Committee, right?
[01:57:49.684 --> 01:57:52.205]  They said, well, you know, we just feel like that's something that the Russians would do.
[01:57:52.585 --> 01:57:53.946]  That was the proof that they gave us.
[01:57:54.346 --> 01:57:56.228]  We feel like that was something that they would do.
[01:57:56.648 --> 01:57:57.929]  That they had the capability to do that.
[01:57:57.949 --> 01:57:58.569]  Well, of course they did.
[01:57:59.522 --> 01:58:01.964]  A lot of people have the capability to do that type of thing.
[01:58:02.524 --> 01:58:17.415]  The very first Guccifer, remember some of these came with somebody that was, we don't know who it was exactly, Guccifer 2.0, but they did catch Guccifer 1.0 and it was a guy living in Romania with no computer science experience or programming experience or anything.
[01:58:17.735 --> 01:58:18.636]  He just guessed
[01:58:19.136 --> 01:58:19.837]  Passwords!
[01:58:19.857 --> 01:58:24.220]  And got all these emails on Colin Powell, on George W. Bush, and so forth.
[01:58:24.680 --> 01:58:28.062]  You don't have to have state-level intelligence to do this.
[01:58:28.122 --> 01:58:29.103]  But that's what we see.
[01:58:29.243 --> 01:58:30.664]  She says, well, I felt it was that way.
[01:58:31.064 --> 01:58:32.445]  This is where it started, folks.
[01:58:33.046 --> 01:58:35.928]  And Politico goes through this, tries to spin it.
[01:58:36.228 --> 01:58:37.929]  Say, well, it's not exactly, but it is.
[01:58:38.189 --> 01:58:38.790]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:41.351 --> 01:58:44.293]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:44.333 --> 01:58:46.375]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:49.665 --> 01:58:51.586]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[01:58:51.626 --> 01:58:52.706]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:58:52.967 --> 01:58:53.887]  Why is this so good?
[01:58:54.167 --> 01:58:59.410]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:58:59.490 --> 01:59:13.056]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:59:13.116 --> 01:59:14.497]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:59:15.397 --> 01:59:16.859]  Spreading disease around.
[01:59:16.919 --> 01:59:19.401]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:59:19.501 --> 01:59:20.762]  These are all parasites.
[01:59:20.802 --> 01:59:21.903]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:59:21.923 --> 01:59:22.944]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:59:23.265 --> 01:59:27.589]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:59:27.789 --> 01:59:30.972]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:59:31.032 --> 01:59:34.134]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:59:34.155 --> 01:59:35.175]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:59:35.215 --> 01:59:37.097]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:37.157 --> 01:59:38.198]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:59:38.478 --> 01:59:40.279]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:59:40.900 --> 01:59:43.922]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[01:59:44.203 --> 01:59:46.084]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:59:46.464 --> 01:59:48.446]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.

[02:00:40.111 --> 02:00:41.392]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:41.412 --> 02:00:41.992]  I'm David Knight.
[02:00:42.052 --> 02:00:43.452]  Alex Jones is in the building.
[02:00:43.512 --> 02:00:45.293]  He will be in the studio in the next segment.
[02:00:45.333 --> 02:00:56.738]  He's going to be taking the helm, and at the bottom of the hour, he'll be breaking down that special intel about very dangerous, lethal information that they've discovered about proposed attacks.
[02:00:56.758 --> 02:01:00.500]  And of course, we talked to James O'Keefe of Project Veritas in the last hour.
[02:01:01.550 --> 02:01:13.716]  Talking about not only attempts to create panic, which can be lethal, but also to release a gas, butyric acid, which is a disgusting smell of vomit in the ventilation system to make people flee.
[02:01:13.736 --> 02:01:15.838]  But it is also very dangerous in a concentrated form.
[02:01:16.718 --> 02:01:25.966]  He exposed that yesterday and today they have part two that is coming out talking about how they're planning to take down the transportation system, the train system.
[02:01:26.026 --> 02:01:29.890]  I presume that's the public train system there in Washington DC.
[02:01:30.590 --> 02:01:31.872]  So there's all kinds of
[02:01:33.252 --> 02:01:42.780]  Things in the wind, quite literally, coming up to the inauguration, and Alex is going to be breaking down some very serious information about serious attacks at the bottom of the hour.
[02:01:43.381 --> 02:01:50.747]  Now this amount of time that we've got left, I touched on this earlier in the day, and this is a story that's up on the Drudge Report from AP.
[02:01:51.228 --> 02:01:54.651]  As robots take jobs, Europeans mull free money for all.
[02:01:55.731 --> 02:02:05.917]  And you have to understand where this is coming from, and I'm very disappointed to see people like Charles Murray, who did groundbreaking work back in the 1980s as a conservative.
[02:02:06.397 --> 02:02:16.183]  He wrote a book, Losing Ground, talking about how welfare was making people dependent on the government, and yet he has now become an advocate
[02:02:17.023 --> 02:02:19.224]  Of universal basic income.
[02:02:19.784 --> 02:02:21.764]  And we've been talking about this for quite some time.
[02:02:21.824 --> 02:02:23.605]  It's clear that this is where they're heading.
[02:02:23.985 --> 02:02:27.526]  We had a referendum last year, and we talked about this extensively at that time.
[02:02:27.566 --> 02:02:28.626]  The Swiss held a referendum.
[02:02:29.026 --> 02:02:35.488]  They proposed giving a basic universal income of $2,500 per month to every Swiss citizen.
[02:02:35.508 --> 02:02:39.389]  So they held a vote on that nationwide, and it was overwhelmingly rejected.
[02:02:40.069 --> 02:02:45.131]  Because the Swiss are still some of the most independent-minded people, and they understand the danger of this.
[02:02:46.365 --> 02:02:53.370]  And this is, of course, when we talk about a universal basic income, this is guaranteed monthly money from the government with no strings attached.
[02:02:53.410 --> 02:02:56.071]  So you're free to get a job, or free not to get a job.
[02:02:56.171 --> 02:03:08.299]  So you can just sit there and play video games all day, or you can try to, you can take art classes, basket weaving, you could start a business if you wanted to, but we don't really need you to do that because we've got the robots that are going to do that now.
[02:03:08.699 --> 02:03:10.361]  See, this is the next stage that's coming.
[02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:30.823]  So they've had a situation where they've been flooding our country with foreign workers, exporting our jobs to other countries, and then bringing in foreign workers, and then putting them in jobs where the younger people really haven't had the experience of being able to go in and work a minimum wage job and begin to learn a work ethic.
[02:03:31.764 --> 02:03:37.786]  There's massive, massive unemployment numbers amongst the millennials because they don't want them to get used to having a job.
[02:03:37.846 --> 02:03:41.528]  They don't want them to get used to having a car and moving around because they're going to take the cars away.
[02:03:41.548 --> 02:03:42.728]  They're going to have the robots run the cars.
[02:03:42.748 --> 02:03:46.229]  They're going to have the robots building the equipment.
[02:03:46.309 --> 02:03:49.471]  And it's all going to be owned by a few people, just as we saw with Davos.
[02:03:49.531 --> 02:03:54.332]  They had 62 people last year that had the equivalent to half of the world's population.
[02:03:54.352 --> 02:03:55.053]  That's down to eight.
[02:03:55.133 --> 02:04:00.515]  That's the kind of concentration of wealth they want to turn everybody into passive renters.
[02:04:01.514 --> 02:04:18.939]  And as we've talked about many times, Alex Jones has talked about it, the discussion with the elite were, are we going to kill everybody, or will we just kind of pacify them and let them gradually disappear as we make it impossible for them to reproduce, or we take over the process of reproduction, just as we saw in Brave New World.
[02:04:18.979 --> 02:04:20.680]  That plan is coming true now.
[02:04:21.100 --> 02:04:22.660]  This is something you have to understand.
[02:04:22.700 --> 02:04:27.742]  Go back and look at how it has already been practiced by the elites, practiced by our own government.
[02:04:27.982 --> 02:04:30.623]  Take a look at the American Indian Reservations.
[02:04:31.283 --> 02:04:33.644]  They put them on these reservations, said you can't leave.
[02:04:34.405 --> 02:04:36.006]  They sent their kids away to be educated.
[02:04:36.506 --> 02:04:39.408]  They restrict what they're able to do in terms of making a living.
[02:04:39.448 --> 02:04:42.169]  They then extended that to the Inner City with Blacks with Welfare Program.
[02:04:42.449 --> 02:04:44.410]  Now it's going to be universal for everybody.
[02:04:44.450 --> 02:04:48.713]  They'll call it a universal basic income and they will restrict you to the cities.
[02:04:48.813 --> 02:04:52.775]  It's called Agenda 21 or the UN Agenda for Sustainable Development 2030.
[02:04:53.055 --> 02:04:54.716]  Stay with us.
[02:04:54.836 --> 02:04:55.997]  Alex Jones will be right back.
[02:04:59.195 --> 02:05:04.621]  With the inauguration around the corner, here's what we know about the fascists who are trying to obstruct Donald Trump's inauguration.
[02:05:04.781 --> 02:05:10.106]  Hundreds of thousands will be there to protest the inauguration of Trump, marching and chanting in the streets over fake news.
[02:05:10.227 --> 02:05:11.228]  But it has gotten darker.
[02:05:11.568 --> 02:05:14.971]  Advertisements to pay Trump protesters cropping up in dozens of U.S.
[02:05:14.992 --> 02:05:15.272]  cities.
[02:05:15.512 --> 02:05:17.954]  People like Rosie McDonald calling for martial law.
[02:05:18.094 --> 02:05:20.716]  Charles Schumer threatening Trump with the intelligence community.
[02:05:20.856 --> 02:05:24.879]  Michael Moore marching in the Women's March against Trump, pushing anti-Trump false narratives.
[02:05:25.079 --> 02:05:30.343]  We know about the fake dossiers, and now more is emerging as radical leftists are planning violent protests.
[02:05:30.543 --> 02:05:34.204]  Plans for planting and discharging acidic chemicals into ventilation systems.
[02:05:34.344 --> 02:05:38.285]  Disrupt J20 is mobilizing thousands and planning on blocking streets and transit.
[02:05:38.425 --> 02:05:40.845]  In response, there will be unprecedented security.
[02:05:40.945 --> 02:05:52.368]  We fully support the First Amendment and the exercise thereof, but people plotting illegal activities need to be brought into custody now, perhaps even arrested, to deter these fascists from illegally disrupting the peaceful transition of power.
[02:05:52.508 --> 02:05:54.608]  But something tells me that's not going to happen.
[02:05:54.728 --> 02:05:58.169]  This is Owen Schroer, and InfoWars will see you at the inauguration.
[02:05:59.341 --> 02:06:06.445]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[02:06:06.826 --> 02:06:20.034]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[02:06:20.974 --> 02:06:32.208]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[02:06:32.869 --> 02:06:38.836]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[02:06:39.577 --> 02:06:47.959]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:56.802]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[02:07:03.615 --> 02:07:05.115]  There is a crisis in America today.
[02:07:05.596 --> 02:07:07.976]  Tens of millions of us are addicted to cell phones.
[02:07:08.296 --> 02:07:15.699]  These little devices, according to many university studies and more, cause health risks such as depression, cancer, and social anxiety.
[02:07:16.079 --> 02:07:19.720]  How can we prevent these harmful devices from harming us and our families?
[02:07:20.060 --> 02:07:21.180]  I have the answer for you today.
[02:07:21.601 --> 02:07:22.761]  It's called the Blocking Pocket.
[02:07:23.493 --> 02:07:28.817]  The Block It Pocket works by securing your phone in its safe, no-radiation compartment.
[02:07:29.238 --> 02:07:35.002]  I use the Block It Pocket every day to protect me from harmful radiation and prevent others from stealing my stuff.
[02:07:35.843 --> 02:07:38.305]  Online, your entire persona is visible.
[02:07:38.505 --> 02:07:44.469]  Your credit card numbers, your email, everything about you that a criminal can use to hack and buy things under your name.
[02:07:45.230 --> 02:07:46.891]  It's a block-it pocket, this is impossible.
[02:07:47.011 --> 02:07:50.052]  It blocks those harmful signals so that you can be safe.
[02:07:50.372 --> 02:07:55.035]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today and make sure to secure your very own block-it pocket.
[02:07:55.075 --> 02:08:06.340]  What's his name?
[02:08:06.580 --> 02:08:07.881]  Big announcements coming up, folks.
[02:08:08.701 --> 02:08:09.201]  We're live.
[02:08:09.561 --> 02:08:10.722]  In the councils of government,
[02:08:11.309 --> 02:08:19.710]  We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[02:08:21.801 --> 02:08:25.102]  I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[02:08:25.543 --> 02:08:28.844]  I order all those assembled to immediately disperse.
[02:08:29.144 --> 02:08:31.305]  It's a military mission in North St.
[02:08:31.345 --> 02:08:31.705]  Louis.
[02:08:32.005 --> 02:08:34.266]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town.
[02:08:34.567 --> 02:08:39.048]  And don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[02:08:39.228 --> 02:08:43.730]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[02:08:44.011 --> 02:08:44.871]  Guns will be taken.
[02:08:44.911 --> 02:08:46.111]  No one will be able to be armed.
[02:08:46.392 --> 02:08:47.372]  We will take all weapons.
[02:08:47.592 --> 02:08:49.933]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[02:08:49.953 --> 02:08:54.355]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[02:08:54.535 --> 02:08:54.815]  Enough.
[02:08:55.375 --> 02:08:55.675]  Enough.
[02:08:56.195 --> 02:08:56.475]  Enough.
[02:08:57.256 --> 02:08:57.476]  Enough.
[02:08:57.616 --> 02:09:02.097]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[02:09:02.177 --> 02:09:06.139]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[02:09:06.539 --> 02:09:12.724]  NSK's Late News 12's Jeff Farrell discovered that clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem.
[02:09:13.405 --> 02:09:13.545]  Us.
[02:09:13.725 --> 02:09:21.632]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[02:09:21.752 --> 02:09:24.334]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[02:09:25.355 --> 02:09:26.936]  Somebody else made that happen.
[02:09:27.794 --> 02:09:33.798]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[02:09:34.059 --> 02:09:38.722]  Blackhawk choppers soaring through the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[02:09:39.022 --> 02:09:43.765]  Heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect, house to house.
[02:09:51.471 --> 02:09:56.454]  It's a joint military training exercise involving local police, also military.
[02:09:58.118 --> 02:09:59.180]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[02:09:59.220 --> 02:10:00.322]  Go back inside right now!
[02:10:00.442 --> 02:10:01.204]  I am inside.
[02:10:01.464 --> 02:10:02.526]  I have two words for you.
[02:10:03.388 --> 02:10:04.249]  Predator groans.
[02:10:05.211 --> 02:10:06.213]  You will never see it coming.
[02:10:10.256 --> 02:10:12.717]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras.
[02:10:13.117 --> 02:10:22.281]  Parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses, and then finding themselves face-to-face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[02:10:22.361 --> 02:10:27.603]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in, and now they're coming in like they're trespassers, punching and shoving people.
[02:10:27.823 --> 02:10:32.605]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down!
[02:10:32.885 --> 02:10:35.006]  If you want them, come and take them!
[02:10:36.673 --> 02:10:37.954]  We are on the march.
[02:10:38.394 --> 02:10:40.916]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:10:41.256 --> 02:10:45.999]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:10:47.240 --> 02:10:51.983]  We're live.
[02:10:52.003 --> 02:10:53.924]  Megan Halsman coming up.
[02:10:56.954 --> 02:10:59.657]  Already the 17th day of January, 2017.
[02:10:59.697 --> 02:11:05.863]  The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
[02:11:06.344 --> 02:11:09.928]  This is the heart of 1776!
[02:11:09.988 --> 02:11:11.209]  More enemy waves coming in.
[02:11:11.229 --> 02:11:13.031]  We're now three days out from the inauguration.
[02:11:17.808 --> 02:11:20.371]  These arrogant globalists thought they defeated humanity.
[02:11:20.651 --> 02:11:24.595]  But the truth is, whether it's Obama or George Soros, they're losers.
[02:11:25.376 --> 02:11:28.440]  Everything they had, everything they threw against us, failed.
[02:11:29.827 --> 02:11:35.090]  Now, just because we defeated these tyrants, for now, doesn't mean we've won the war.
[02:11:35.410 --> 02:11:39.173]  The war is happening within our hearts, within our souls, within our minds.
[02:11:39.653 --> 02:11:41.274]  We have to be good.
[02:11:41.934 --> 02:11:42.755]  We have to be pure.
[02:11:42.795 --> 02:11:43.635]  We have to be strong.
[02:11:43.955 --> 02:11:45.396]  We have to build prosperity.
[02:11:45.776 --> 02:11:48.278]  We have to bring everyone of every race, color, and creed together.
[02:11:49.762 --> 02:11:55.247]  If we're going to truly defeat these tyrants who believed we were going to fail, who believed their divide and conquer would work.
[02:11:56.088 --> 02:12:03.695]  Yes, we've won the first phase, but the battle for the soul of humanity has just begun.
[02:12:04.175 --> 02:12:10.721]  But Obama and Hillary and Soros, you were losers from the day you were born.
[02:12:29.105 --> 02:12:33.508]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[02:12:41.598 --> 02:12:44.520]  And that flag is the American flag!
[02:12:44.620 --> 02:12:48.943]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[02:12:48.963 --> 02:12:52.044]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[02:12:52.064 --> 02:12:53.965]  I will not let you down.
[02:12:54.006 --> 02:12:56.947]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[02:12:57.147 --> 02:12:59.949]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[02:12:59.989 --> 02:13:02.230]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[02:13:02.270 --> 02:13:07.293]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[02:13:07.513 --> 02:13:08.974]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:13:09.114 --> 02:13:10.035]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:13:12.615 --> 02:13:16.998]  And ladies and gentlemen, I am very, very happy to be back in Austin, Texas.
[02:13:17.438 --> 02:13:25.944]  Got off the airplane about an hour ago, and I'm right back here in the saddle with the wonderful crew here in Austin, Texas, coming to you worldwide.
[02:13:26.444 --> 02:13:27.425]  David Knight in the last
[02:13:28.780 --> 02:13:36.524]  12th Broadcast, they also have a Sunday show, has done a superlative job along with Paul Joseph Watson and the rest of this team.
[02:13:37.344 --> 02:13:54.953]  I am just again very very honored and humbled to be associated with this great crew of human beings that are looking for the truth and promoting real justice and analyzing the globalist scientific plan to dumb down, balkanize and enslave the people.
[02:13:56.209 --> 02:14:00.891]  Doesn't mean we're perfect, doesn't mean we get it all right, but we try to get it right, and our hearts are in the right places.
[02:14:00.971 --> 02:14:06.214]  And you can see that InfoWars, thanks to you, that our InfoWars is changing the world.
[02:14:08.075 --> 02:14:08.875]  We're three days out.
[02:14:09.816 --> 02:14:13.257]  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and then it's Friday.
[02:14:13.297 --> 02:14:15.458]  Or you could technically say we're three and a half days out.
[02:14:16.279 --> 02:14:24.623]  Four days until we know what the aftermath is of the 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump, actually not just getting elected, but getting into office.
[02:14:26.286 --> 02:14:28.487]  It's not a hard prediction to make.
[02:14:28.507 --> 02:14:31.049]  In fact, it's a really easy one to make.
[02:14:32.369 --> 02:14:33.290]  A hundred to zero.
[02:14:34.410 --> 02:14:39.313]  That they're going to ratchet up the disinformation every day before he gets into office.
[02:14:39.353 --> 02:14:42.835]  And it's going to continue after, but it's not going to be as big a threat.
[02:14:42.875 --> 02:14:43.855]  It's still going to be very serious.
[02:14:45.176 --> 02:14:47.017]  But the price of liberty is eternal vigilance.
[02:14:47.597 --> 02:14:51.159]  If I ever see anything that's real about Trump, I'll come out and say it.
[02:14:51.559 --> 02:14:52.520]  He's wrong on torture.
[02:14:53.464 --> 02:14:56.745]  And he's wrong on, quote, give the FBI the iPhone code.
[02:14:57.425 --> 02:14:59.646]  It's the code to all the phones, and they already have the back doors.
[02:14:59.946 --> 02:15:00.986]  They can already get into them.
[02:15:01.326 --> 02:15:06.167]  And so it's just an excuse, just like Obama did last week, to just end the Fourth Amendment entirely.
[02:15:06.187 --> 02:15:17.650]  I mean, he just came out and said, oh, I'm just signing a new order, and I've ordered the intelligence agencies to just keep everything, track everything, and do whatever you want, and nobody has to even be a suspect or fit a profile.
[02:15:20.131 --> 02:15:20.751]  I don't like that.
[02:15:21.547 --> 02:15:24.568]  But that said, Trump's heart's in the right place.
[02:15:24.708 --> 02:15:36.354]  He's for real, and he's bringing in real policies that unseat the globalists and are going to dump so much opportunity and money on the American people.
[02:15:36.434 --> 02:15:37.894]  I mean, it's going to be crazy.
[02:15:38.355 --> 02:15:41.116]  Our only problem is we're going to turn into decadent slobs again.
[02:15:42.637 --> 02:15:49.900]  That's the problem with the Trump plan, is that prosperity makes monsters, as Victor Hugo said.
[02:15:51.425 --> 02:15:51.745]  It's true.
[02:15:52.485 --> 02:15:54.286]  Adversity makes men, prosperity makes monsters.
[02:15:56.327 --> 02:16:04.510]  Liberty always brings incredible wealth and that cycle continues then into the corruption, into the degradation, into the collapse of society.
[02:16:05.611 --> 02:16:08.892]  But do we have to keep repeating history over and over again?
[02:16:10.285 --> 02:16:15.566]  But we live in a very complex world and freedom has given us so many choices that we will still have freedom.
[02:16:15.626 --> 02:16:22.367]  It's just not going to be equally distributed because a lot of people didn't have the history of freedom or they didn't fight for freedom when they had it.
[02:16:25.648 --> 02:16:29.208]  You see, I love America and I love this planet and I love all of God's gifts.
[02:16:29.588 --> 02:16:34.469]  I'm not somebody who's a loser who's just bitching and complaining because I'm in a victimology.
[02:16:36.369 --> 02:16:38.290]  I'm fighting for what's good in the world.
[02:16:38.550 --> 02:16:39.790]  That's why I'm so angry.
[02:16:40.819 --> 02:16:42.020]  I'm territorial about it.
[02:16:43.281 --> 02:16:45.183]  And I think about how people get territorial.
[02:16:45.483 --> 02:16:51.169]  When I was on vacation, I'd be sitting there in a restaurant slash bar watching people watch NFL playoffs.
[02:16:51.609 --> 02:16:53.771]  They'd be arguing with each other, kind of bucking up.
[02:16:53.811 --> 02:17:01.699]  It was all symbolic about, are you for the Cowboys or are you for this group or are you for the Steelers or are you for the Patriots?
[02:17:03.112 --> 02:17:17.655]  Imagine if people wore jerseys about their favorite part of the Bill of Rights, or if they wore jerseys about their belief in property rights, or God for that matter, or their children.
[02:17:18.395 --> 02:17:26.337]  But instead we've been given these facsimiles of commitment so we can commit to the equivalent of a blow-up sex doll.
[02:17:26.357 --> 02:17:30.138]  And I use that analogy, I'm going to skip this break, all the time.
[02:17:31.221 --> 02:17:43.164]  That sports teams are admittedly bread and circuses to control the population and to take our male energies and our tribal energies and direct them off into something that doesn't matter to the establishment.
[02:17:44.065 --> 02:17:47.006]  We play the games of children while the elite control things.
[02:17:47.066 --> 02:17:48.406]  We sleep while they live.
[02:17:49.790 --> 02:18:15.580]  I'm not criticizing anybody that's into sports, but if you pull back from it and see how sick it is, there was a French nobleman, I forget his name, you can search in the history of the modern Olympics, and you'll learn in the 1870s into the 1920s, there was a French member of the former royal family who put his time and energy into controlling the population through popularizing sports for adults.
[02:18:16.400 --> 02:18:16.600]  I don't
[02:18:37.861 --> 02:18:40.223]  Don't let them conduct real trains, give them toy trains.
[02:18:40.604 --> 02:18:41.144]  Figuratively.
[02:18:41.685 --> 02:18:42.946]  Don't let them be real warriors.
[02:18:43.266 --> 02:18:44.247]  We don't want that going on.
[02:18:44.307 --> 02:18:48.431]  Let's have them all be in their little tribal groups and go paint their faces up and yell and scream.
[02:18:49.112 --> 02:19:00.323]  And you can go read how his writings got picked up by the turn of the century and they started having Olympics and then Hitler picked it up and made it really big in 1936.
[02:19:02.779 --> 02:19:05.141]  And invited members of that fellow's family.
[02:19:05.161 --> 02:19:09.185]  I should go into history, I don't have the articles pulled up in history, but it's amazing.
[02:19:11.087 --> 02:19:12.508]  And then they exported it here.
[02:19:13.629 --> 02:19:18.374]  I mean, it wasn't until the 20s and 30s that men's baseball teams were taken seriously.
[02:19:18.954 --> 02:19:20.195]  Or any of this crap.
[02:19:21.104 --> 02:19:22.944]  That we think is America, it's not!
[02:19:23.244 --> 02:19:28.185]  Just like Santa Claus wasn't popular until the 40s, when Coca-Cola popularized Santa Claus.
[02:19:28.485 --> 02:19:29.686]  Yeah, he existed!
[02:19:30.166 --> 02:19:34.027]  Did you know that Santa Claus in England got banned 300 plus years ago?
[02:19:34.527 --> 02:19:44.249]  Because people were dressing up, Santa Claus wore red and white stripes, it was a gang, and he went out and raped and killed people and burned buildings down on Christmas Eve.
[02:19:45.349 --> 02:19:46.589]  He was basically Freddy Krueger.
[02:19:49.168 --> 02:19:53.514]  And that's why you kind of give an amalgamation today where it's, oh, Krampus!
[02:19:53.534 --> 02:19:56.258]  You know, the bad German Santa Claus.
[02:19:56.899 --> 02:20:00.003]  And the Russians have their bad Santa Claus, and the Dutch have theirs.
[02:20:01.485 --> 02:20:12.268]  You know, then the good Santa Claus has his Black Peters, and I mean, it all varies culture to culture, but Santa Claus, you think's been there forever, was made up in the 1940s.
[02:20:12.308 --> 02:20:15.169]  The guy, you know, in the red and white suit.
[02:20:15.529 --> 02:20:19.571]  There was a poem before that, what, 60 years before, about the night before Christmas.
[02:20:20.491 --> 02:20:22.612]  But other than that, it's a total invention!
[02:20:23.372 --> 02:20:25.092]  Just like the stupid NFL.
[02:20:26.073 --> 02:20:26.873]  Just like all of it.
[02:20:28.840 --> 02:20:30.340]  So here's why I'm against the NFL.
[02:20:30.760 --> 02:20:33.061]  It's been set up to emasculate me.
[02:20:34.901 --> 02:20:36.262]  Or to demasculate me.
[02:20:36.582 --> 02:20:46.104]  It's been set up to steal who I am, so that if there's a threat to myself and my family, I'll be politically involved in modern forms of warfare.
[02:20:48.344 --> 02:20:53.865]  That are not physical, but are done through the law, and done through speech, and done through the soapbox, and the electronic soapbox.
[02:20:54.145 --> 02:20:55.566]  That's what I'm supposed to do as a man.
[02:20:56.346 --> 02:20:57.006]  And instead,
[02:20:59.104 --> 02:21:00.325]  We play fantasy football.
[02:21:01.446 --> 02:21:06.270]  We play a fantasy game about another fantasy that doesn't matter.
[02:21:06.470 --> 02:21:18.361]  And then we watch television and we see actors playing fake newscasters telling us about fake news a la Stephen Colbert.
[02:21:18.981 --> 02:21:21.143]  And the irony is not lost on people.
[02:21:21.183 --> 02:21:25.187]  Take Maxine Waters and all these other people.
[02:21:27.245 --> 02:21:34.431]  Running around saying, we played the clip earlier, that Donald Trump isn't just a Russian agent.
[02:21:36.372 --> 02:21:40.055]  Donald Trump actually doesn't have any thoughts of his own.
[02:21:40.476 --> 02:21:47.241]  His tweets, everything he says is told to him by the Russians because Americans couldn't come up with Crooked Hillary.
[02:21:48.322 --> 02:21:53.906]  It'd be like if you're driving through the countryside and you see a red barn, and you go, look, it's a red barn.
[02:21:53.926 --> 02:21:57.689]  They go, oh, the Russians must have told you it's a red barn.
[02:21:57.709 --> 02:21:59.150]  You're like, no, it's a red barn.
[02:22:00.371 --> 02:22:02.572]  No one ever thought that she's crooked.
[02:22:03.093 --> 02:22:05.835]  No one ever imagined that that would be a nickname for her.
[02:22:08.851 --> 02:22:11.953]  I mean, I would call Jeb Bush silver spoon dumbass.
[02:22:12.493 --> 02:22:13.974]  Did the Russians tell me to say that?
[02:22:14.014 --> 02:22:15.054]  No, that's what he is.
[02:22:15.434 --> 02:22:16.495]  It's not that we're against wealth.
[02:22:16.675 --> 02:22:20.377]  We're against somebody giving everything multi-generationally.
[02:22:20.577 --> 02:22:23.859]  The Bushes have been given everything for two generations.
[02:22:27.341 --> 02:22:33.124]  It was Grandpa that actually made a deal with the Nazis and ran some major fraud and scams, or at least steal the money.
[02:22:36.567 --> 02:22:37.647]  And it just goes on and on.
[02:22:38.087 --> 02:22:44.089]  And then Gloria Allred comes climbing out of whatever horse's inn she lives in.
[02:22:44.109 --> 02:22:58.673]  And, you know, she comes climbing out, you know, like a possum to announce that, oh, another woman, another woman that Donald Trump was made advances on.
[02:23:00.374 --> 02:23:03.155]  Every time these women actually get into court, it all folds.
[02:23:03.175 --> 02:23:04.675]  It's all made up.
[02:23:09.568 --> 02:23:15.809]  You know, I know a lot of people that have known Donald Trump for a long time, and I'm not going to defend Donald Trump with the inside knowledge I have.
[02:23:16.149 --> 02:23:17.109]  Let me just explain something.
[02:23:17.629 --> 02:23:25.351]  Donald Trump is a clean freak, and Donald Trump is very specific about any woman he dates or marries.
[02:23:26.131 --> 02:23:28.231]  If Donald Trump likes you, he's going to marry you.
[02:23:30.512 --> 02:23:33.752]  I mean, if you're getting in the sack with Donald Trump, you're getting married to him.
[02:23:34.492 --> 02:23:36.373]  You can fault him for being married three, four times.
[02:23:36.653 --> 02:23:38.133]  The point is, he's one of those guys where
[02:23:39.497 --> 02:23:41.899]  If he's gonna jump in the sack with you, he's gonna marry you.
[02:23:42.039 --> 02:23:45.461]  This is complete made-up baloney.
[02:23:46.242 --> 02:23:46.782]  And they know it.
[02:23:47.523 --> 02:24:03.915]  Just like the not one, not two, not three, not four, not five, but six lawsuits that have been dropped with Jane Doe made-up names of him raping teenage girls with Jeffrey Epstein 20-something years ago.
[02:24:04.316 --> 02:24:05.997]  Totally made up.
[02:24:07.267 --> 02:24:08.548]  Completely made up.
[02:24:09.089 --> 02:24:11.091]  It's the Clintons that hang around with him.
[02:24:11.451 --> 02:24:15.275]  They knew that was gonna come out, so they ran it in the media that it was the Trump.
[02:24:17.597 --> 02:24:18.058]  The Trump.
[02:24:18.618 --> 02:24:26.666]  The same thing over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over again.
[02:24:30.575 --> 02:24:34.098]  And you know, folks, Paul Watson reported on it.
[02:24:34.118 --> 02:24:40.722]  We were contacted by an individual at NBC and we made him show credentials in the whole nine yards.
[02:24:40.843 --> 02:24:45.966]  We still say, claiming to be with NBC, that they've been passing this tape around that I've heard about for over a year.
[02:24:45.986 --> 02:24:47.527]  It's like the PP Gate thing.
[02:24:47.748 --> 02:24:49.609]  Heard about that a year and a half ago on the 4chan site.
[02:24:50.630 --> 02:24:51.210]  Totally made up.
[02:24:51.290 --> 02:24:52.611]  Oh, by the way, they admit that's all fake.
[02:24:54.172 --> 02:24:55.133]  They admit that's all fake.
[02:24:56.408 --> 02:24:57.048]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:24:57.088 --> 02:25:00.609]  They go on Hardball last night and bring it all up again.
[02:25:01.690 --> 02:25:02.250]  That's right.
[02:25:02.310 --> 02:25:03.851]  I mean, she says with a straight face.
[02:25:03.871 --> 02:25:05.491]  I think I'm going to play it again later.
[02:25:06.391 --> 02:25:07.872]  The big announcement is coming up in the next segment.
[02:25:10.653 --> 02:25:13.574]  That the Russians came up with the term Crooked Hillary.
[02:25:16.147 --> 02:25:18.210]  And now they've got news articles out saying it's worse.
[02:25:18.951 --> 02:25:20.113]  Hillary for prison!
[02:25:20.894 --> 02:25:22.316]  All of it came from the Russians!
[02:25:22.837 --> 02:25:25.461]  That's right, I didn't think of that.
[02:25:26.322 --> 02:25:27.363]  The Russians did.
[02:25:27.964 --> 02:25:29.186]  The Russians are in my ear.
[02:25:29.226 --> 02:25:30.869]  Here, what do I say next, Putin?
[02:25:33.646 --> 02:25:40.831]  Here it is, desperate Democrat calls for Trump impeachment, claims Russia fed him the term, crooked Hillary, and everything else!
[02:25:41.271 --> 02:25:42.712]  That's right, at 2 a.m.
[02:25:43.193 --> 02:25:52.739]  he goes into like an egg of silence, a little pod, and Putin pops up and then tells Donald Trump when no one can tell Donald Trump anything.
[02:25:57.463 --> 02:25:58.604]  Unless you're super aggressive.
[02:26:00.305 --> 02:26:03.027]  Very few people that Trump actually listens to.
[02:26:04.184 --> 02:26:06.985]  Oh, you gotta have a track record of being on target for Trump List 2 as well.
[02:26:08.325 --> 02:26:09.745]  I wonder who Trump listens to?
[02:26:12.706 --> 02:26:16.647]  You know, listen, I can get Trump back on the show if I want to, but that's not even the big issue.
[02:26:16.747 --> 02:26:28.189]  I know how much trouble it'll cause, what a big ass it'll be, and so Trump has not been back on the show yet, but I'm not gonna give the media some big heydays here, but let's just say that
[02:26:32.856 --> 02:26:38.461]  I do talk to Trump some, the President, and it's not the power trip that it's the President.
[02:26:39.041 --> 02:26:47.028]  It's the power trip that it's the President fighting the New World Order under complete attack, and history is completely happening in front of us, and it's so cool!
[02:26:47.048 --> 02:27:01.020]  I mean, Trump is just so classy, folks, and that's why you see all these liars and all these scumbags and all the things they're doing, like Democratic Congresswoman,
[02:27:03.052 --> 02:27:08.716]  Coming on Chris Matthews and claiming... I mean, I just can't get over this.
[02:27:08.736 --> 02:27:10.057]  This is the craziest crap.
[02:27:10.717 --> 02:27:11.978]  But they really say this.
[02:27:12.038 --> 02:27:17.042]  See, the Democrats aren't just now saying any criticism of them is racist.
[02:27:17.882 --> 02:27:23.306]  They're now saying any information, like, I don't like the TPP or Obamacare, ripping me off.
[02:27:23.466 --> 02:27:24.587]  Oh my gosh, you're racist.
[02:27:24.967 --> 02:27:26.128]  Or you're a Russian-Asian.
[02:27:27.249 --> 02:27:29.731]  And notice they're only putting black people out now.
[02:27:31.038 --> 02:27:40.807]  Like John Lewis, like Maxine Waters, and others, to criticize Trump so that when he counters back, they go, oh my gosh, look, you're a racist!
[02:27:42.848 --> 02:27:44.810]  John Lewis, you are a Russian agent.
[02:27:44.830 --> 02:27:45.911]  You should be overthrown.
[02:27:45.931 --> 02:27:46.912]  There should be an impeachment.
[02:27:46.932 --> 02:27:47.753]  You're not legitimate.
[02:27:48.053 --> 02:27:49.134]  I don't see you as legitimate.
[02:27:50.171 --> 02:27:54.116]  Gee, Congressman Lewis, you've got a really bad economy in your area of Georgia.
[02:27:54.176 --> 02:27:56.058]  I'd like to help those inner-city communities.
[02:27:56.599 --> 02:27:58.361]  Please work with me as your president.
[02:27:58.701 --> 02:28:00.463]  I really want to get some jobs in there.
[02:28:00.603 --> 02:28:01.805]  Ha ha ha!
[02:28:01.885 --> 02:28:01.945]  Yes!
[02:28:02.506 --> 02:28:05.830]  I raised it on Martin Luther King weekend!
[02:28:05.850 --> 02:28:08.433]  They set the whole thing up!
[02:28:08.693 --> 02:28:09.794]  That's how they're thinking at CNN!
[02:28:11.172 --> 02:28:12.413]  We'll have Lewis come on.
[02:28:12.733 --> 02:28:17.656]  The media will go, oh my gosh, a congressman says Trump's not fit to be in there and he doesn't recognize him.
[02:28:17.676 --> 02:28:18.516]  There's a big boycott.
[02:28:18.756 --> 02:28:19.777]  Will Trump be impeached?
[02:28:19.797 --> 02:28:20.677]  Dun, dun, dun.
[02:28:20.957 --> 02:28:22.538]  I mean, as if that isn't sappy enough.
[02:28:23.039 --> 02:28:24.900]  Then they shift into the next phase of it.
[02:28:26.961 --> 02:28:30.203]  Going, he attacked a civil rights icon.
[02:28:32.824 --> 02:28:34.325]  I mean, this is just crazy.
[02:28:36.280 --> 02:28:40.104]  Says nothing about race other than, I want to help black areas.
[02:28:40.364 --> 02:28:41.845]  I want to get jobs in there.
[02:28:42.326 --> 02:28:44.027]  I want to make people not be dependent.
[02:28:44.148 --> 02:28:48.812]  I want to reverse the great society that domesticated black people and is domesticating everybody else.
[02:28:49.032 --> 02:28:51.294]  And they go, oh my god, you're racist!
[02:28:53.937 --> 02:28:56.319]  And now he counters this congresswoman.
[02:28:56.339 --> 02:28:58.461]  They're going to come out and say, oh, that's because she's black.
[02:28:58.581 --> 02:28:59.182]  I've noticed that.
[02:29:00.968 --> 02:29:05.132]  Everything, everyone making these accusations is black, on purpose.
[02:29:05.453 --> 02:29:10.458]  It's not Hillary doing it, it's not her surrogates, it's black folks.
[02:29:11.259 --> 02:29:14.522]  They're now putting out there, like the woman that's a Fox contributor, Ms.
[02:29:14.582 --> 02:29:17.925]  Green, who's up for the job as the Democratic head.
[02:29:18.506 --> 02:29:21.729]  And Tucker Carlson's like, what do you think of his plan to cut the price of prescription drugs?
[02:29:22.010 --> 02:29:24.052]  Well, he's a racist, so I don't even discuss it.
[02:29:26.099 --> 02:29:27.300]  Okay, well what about this topic?
[02:29:27.420 --> 02:29:28.940]  I'm not even discussing his topics!
[02:29:29.240 --> 02:29:29.721]  Racist!
[02:29:29.881 --> 02:29:31.041]  I have one magic word!
[02:29:31.061 --> 02:29:32.542]  I mean, this is the craziest!
[02:29:32.982 --> 02:29:33.903]  Or, Russian agent!
[02:29:34.123 --> 02:29:34.823]  Russian agent!
[02:29:35.443 --> 02:29:37.384]  I mean, the truth is, Trump's a vegetable, folks.
[02:29:37.424 --> 02:29:38.284]  He can't even talk.
[02:29:38.605 --> 02:29:41.126]  He's actually a robot that Putin speaks into.
[02:29:41.386 --> 02:29:42.446]  This is ridiculous!
[02:29:42.486 --> 02:29:44.207]  I mean, this is so stupid!
[02:29:44.487 --> 02:29:46.008]  This is unbelievable!
[02:29:46.448 --> 02:29:48.109]  Stay with us, the big announcement straight ahead.
[02:29:48.669 --> 02:29:49.589]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.070 --> 02:29:51.670]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.611 --> 02:29:55.292]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.892 --> 02:30:06.068]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[02:30:06.610 --> 02:30:08.033]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[02:30:08.922 --> 02:30:10.803]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[02:30:11.423 --> 02:30:16.965]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[02:30:17.565 --> 02:30:24.868]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[02:30:25.968 --> 02:30:28.029]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[02:30:28.309 --> 02:30:29.510]  This is the best system out there.
[02:30:29.770 --> 02:30:32.531]  And we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[02:30:32.791 --> 02:30:33.531]  This is how it works.
[02:30:33.831 --> 02:30:34.351]  You order.
[02:30:34.471 --> 02:30:35.272]  Customized or
[02:30:36.357 --> 02:30:37.818]  Straight from the factory, however you want it.
[02:30:38.319 --> 02:30:41.462]  It is shipped on the next business day to you and your family.
[02:30:41.762 --> 02:30:45.826]  And a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this republic.
[02:30:46.046 --> 02:30:46.807]  You cannot lose.
[02:30:46.847 --> 02:30:47.948]  You're funding the Infowar.
[02:30:48.248 --> 02:30:54.995]  You're getting the highest quality product, the most tested, the most durable, the most certified, the most believed in.
[02:30:55.335 --> 02:30:59.279]  You need to have this true piece of America ready in minutes.
[02:30:59.779 --> 02:31:08.785]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:31:08.845 --> 02:31:16.930]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:31:17.270 --> 02:31:21.954]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:31:22.134 --> 02:31:28.879]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:28.939 --> 02:31:36.025]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:31:36.105 --> 02:31:42.990]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:31:43.130 --> 02:31:47.073]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:31:47.193 --> 02:31:52.639]  With the inauguration around the corner, here's what we know about the fascists who are trying to obstruct Donald Trump's inauguration.
[02:32:05.151 --> 02:32:10.495]  Hundreds of thousands will be there to protest the inauguration of Trump, marching and chanting in the streets over fake news.
[02:32:10.615 --> 02:32:11.616]  But it has gotten darker.
[02:32:11.936 --> 02:32:15.339]  Advertisements to pay Trump protesters cropping up in dozens of U.S.
[02:32:15.379 --> 02:32:15.679]  cities.
[02:32:15.899 --> 02:32:18.341]  People like Rosie McDonald calling for martial law.
[02:32:18.481 --> 02:32:21.123]  Charles Schumer threatening Trump with the intelligence community.
[02:32:21.244 --> 02:32:25.287]  Michael Moore marching in the Women's March against Trump, pushing anti-Trump false narratives.
[02:32:25.467 --> 02:32:30.671]  We know about the fake dossiers, and now more is emerging as radical leftists are planning violent protests.
[02:32:30.871 --> 02:32:34.512]  Plans for planting and discharging acidic chemicals into ventilation systems.
[02:32:34.672 --> 02:32:38.593]  Disrupt J20 is mobilizing thousands and planning on blocking streets and transit.
[02:32:38.733 --> 02:32:41.153]  In response, there will be unprecedented security.
[02:32:41.273 --> 02:32:52.696]  We fully support the First Amendment and the exercise thereof, but people plotting illegal activities need to be brought into custody now, perhaps even arrested, to deter these fascists from illegally disrupting the peaceful transition of power.
[02:32:52.816 --> 02:32:54.916]  But something tells me that's not going to happen.
[02:32:55.056 --> 02:32:58.477]  This is Owen Schroer, and InfoWars will see you at the inauguration.
[02:33:15.931 --> 02:33:19.835]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:21.437 --> 02:33:26.142]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:29.650 --> 02:33:32.352]  The fight against the New World Order is a man's game.
[02:33:32.572 --> 02:33:34.253]  And believe me, InfoWars is.
[02:33:34.733 --> 02:33:36.995]  Not just the tip of the spear, but the spearhead.
[02:33:37.375 --> 02:33:42.318]  And you, the listeners and viewers, are the heart, the blood, the soul of this entire operation.
[02:33:42.358 --> 02:33:43.639]  I don't say that patronizingly.
[02:33:44.780 --> 02:33:46.481]  You need to know the effect you're having.
[02:33:46.761 --> 02:33:51.485]  I just had an incredible experience the last two weeks traveling
[02:33:54.241 --> 02:34:00.683]  All over the place, and the listenership has just exploded to a level where it's beyond Fight Club.
[02:34:02.044 --> 02:34:04.364]  And again, I don't say that to brag and say, oh, our show's big.
[02:34:05.005 --> 02:34:06.965]  It's the content of the broadcast that's big.
[02:34:07.566 --> 02:34:13.187]  But the average person doesn't understand how strong the Liberty Movement is worldwide, not just here in the U.S.
[02:34:13.347 --> 02:34:15.188]  It's gigantic.
[02:34:16.469 --> 02:34:17.669]  And people really get it.
[02:34:18.509 --> 02:34:23.291]  I had so many Asians and Hispanics and black folks
[02:34:24.386 --> 02:34:31.712]  Come up to me that were listeners, with tears in their eyes, thanking me and thanking Donald Trump and thanking Roger Stone.
[02:34:32.833 --> 02:34:36.096]  And I was like, don't thank me, brother, we're in this together!
[02:34:37.677 --> 02:34:42.221]  We all recognize we've got real evil in control that's trying to divide everybody.
[02:34:43.802 --> 02:34:51.829]  The over-the-top scandals they've levied against Trump, that he's a Russian spy, Maxine Waters, we played the clip earlier, I'm going to play it coming up, saying that
[02:34:52.884 --> 02:35:00.288]  The Russians feed him, Crooked Hillary, and feed him that she's sick, and feed Trump everything.
[02:35:00.368 --> 02:35:04.110]  That's the craziest thing in the world, to say anybody's feeding Trump something.
[02:35:04.450 --> 02:35:12.314]  Nevertheless, it was Drudge in 2013 that first began to talk about how bad she looked, because she looked like she was dying!
[02:35:12.954 --> 02:35:14.955]  And she'd been in the hospital for a year!
[02:35:15.275 --> 02:35:16.496]  That's not the Russians!
[02:35:18.217 --> 02:35:20.778]  Now, it's all about the Russians, isn't it?
[02:35:21.806 --> 02:35:22.707]  Here's the big announcement.
[02:35:23.608 --> 02:35:28.592]  I'm going to let Roger Stone, and he's in the middle of it, he's the center of it, break it down for you.
[02:35:29.552 --> 02:35:32.515]  I've had to sit on this info for a week and a half.
[02:35:32.735 --> 02:35:34.877]  Believe me, I didn't like doing it, but it had to be done.
[02:35:36.698 --> 02:35:41.562]  This deals with the deep state in every way, and this deals with the free press in this country.
[02:35:42.063 --> 02:35:45.405]  And Stone also wanted to spend time to talk to his sources.
[02:35:46.502 --> 02:35:49.511]  And to find out where they think this all originated from.
[02:35:50.093 --> 02:35:54.105]  And it's very clear, if you do the chess math, where it came from.
[02:35:57.284 --> 02:36:02.067]  Because who out there are they more obsessed about than Roger Stone or Alex Jones?
[02:36:02.247 --> 02:36:04.609]  Roger Stone probably even more than I. They're obsessed with him.
[02:36:05.129 --> 02:36:07.831]  He goes, Donald Trump, Roger Stone, Alex Jones, Stephen Bannon.
[02:36:08.272 --> 02:36:09.953]  And believe me, I don't want to be at the top of that list.
[02:36:10.033 --> 02:36:10.813]  It's a dangerous list.
[02:36:11.394 --> 02:36:15.456]  So they're starting a congressional investigation into the Russian hack.
[02:36:15.496 --> 02:36:20.340]  They've already had McCain and his little show trials with PPgate, which they now admit is totally made up.
[02:36:21.653 --> 02:36:23.254]  And the British government's come out and said it's bull.
[02:36:23.814 --> 02:36:24.774]  Well, of course it's bull.
[02:36:25.675 --> 02:36:27.295]  It was on 4chan a year and a half ago.
[02:36:27.355 --> 02:36:28.216]  That's the hacker site.
[02:36:28.716 --> 02:36:30.297]  It was written by a 12-year-old, probably.
[02:36:30.917 --> 02:36:33.218]  So, where is all this going?
[02:36:33.338 --> 02:36:35.359]  Why is this one of the biggest announcements I've ever made?
[02:36:35.799 --> 02:36:44.162]  Probably the biggest, if you look at the whole atmosphere of where we are, to let you know how ruthless the enemy is and the climate we're in.
[02:36:44.582 --> 02:36:49.925]  So, Roger Stone, I'm going to give you the floor to walk through this, the motive, why they've done this.
[02:36:52.327 --> 02:36:55.509]  This is the stuff of a James Bond movie.
[02:36:56.589 --> 02:36:57.350]  Roger Stone.
[02:36:58.730 --> 02:37:00.911]  Alex, great to be back with you.
[02:37:00.931 --> 02:37:18.380]  I'm glad to see you back from vacation, and I am glad to have turned in my manuscript for about 145,000 words, about 460 pages, for The Making of the President 2016, How Donald Trump Orchestrated an American Revolution.
[02:37:19.190 --> 02:37:24.411]  Alex, as you know, prior to Christmas, I became extremely ill.
[02:37:25.011 --> 02:37:36.134]  This was at precisely the time that I had to be prodigiously trying to produce about 2,000 words a day for my book.
[02:37:37.134 --> 02:37:41.535]  And one of the important aspects of my book is the detailed debunking
[02:37:42.515 --> 02:38:08.141]  Of this Russian hacking nonsense and a very direct refutation of the claims by John Podesta and the mainstream media and others, The Washington Post, The New York Times, that I had advance notice of the hacking, that the hacking ever took place, that as Podesta told The Washington Post, I told Donald Trump in advance.
[02:38:08.681 --> 02:38:10.262]  So I expose these things.
[02:38:11.184 --> 02:38:21.369]  Now we have a congressional investigation and Senator Richard Burr and Senator John Warner are going to conduct public hearings.
[02:38:22.289 --> 02:38:27.231]  Now, in all honesty, I would welcome being invited to those public hearings.
[02:38:27.952 --> 02:38:30.353]  I welcome their investigators.
[02:38:31.333 --> 02:38:39.217]  As I said, I would welcome an FBI investigation when Congressman Jerry Nadler and Congressman
[02:38:40.542 --> 02:38:49.366]  Elijah Cummings, in a classic case of the new McCarthyism, demanded of the FBI director that I be investigated.
[02:38:50.907 --> 02:38:52.528]  I welcome that scrutiny.
[02:38:52.548 --> 02:39:04.994]  And let me just interject, months ago when this was all happening on a daily basis, National News attacking you, CNN not letting you come on and respond when they're calling you a Russian spy, Cheney worked for WikiLeaks, totally made up.
[02:39:05.954 --> 02:39:08.857]  And so if you do the math here, there's a problem.
[02:39:08.877 --> 02:39:10.458]  In fact, on air, we joked about it.
[02:39:10.498 --> 02:39:11.840]  We said, this is wonderful.
[02:39:11.900 --> 02:39:16.103]  Let them have hearings and call you in on C-SPAN with a new McCarthyism.
[02:39:16.123 --> 02:39:19.046]  You'll be like the famous lawyer that says, you know, have you no decency?
[02:39:19.306 --> 02:39:20.868]  We talked about all that.
[02:39:21.288 --> 02:39:22.449]  But so you're doing the math.
[02:39:22.529 --> 02:39:23.310]  What's the problem?
[02:39:23.550 --> 02:39:32.937]  You're going to go with this Russians took over the election idea, and you've got this one guy who's the fall guy we're going to blame it all on, but we don't want him talking.
[02:39:33.217 --> 02:39:37.340]  It'd be much better if he wasn't there, and then we could say the Russians did it.
[02:39:37.360 --> 02:39:38.200]  Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:39:41.986 --> 02:39:45.650]  Glenn Greenwald, I think, nailed this this week in his piece.
[02:39:45.750 --> 02:39:51.876]  The deep state is very upset about the election of Donald Trump and the fact that he's going to upend the established order.
[02:39:52.377 --> 02:39:58.823]  They're not going to get their expanded proxy war in Syria, which they desperately want.
[02:39:59.243 --> 02:40:03.207]  They're not going to get World War Three out of a President Donald Trump.
[02:40:03.928 --> 02:40:05.590]  Who is committed to detente?
[02:40:05.990 --> 02:40:12.116]  Who is committed to a new relationship with the Russians, some hard-headed negotiations, but peace?
[02:40:12.777 --> 02:40:21.106]  We can spend our money on missiles and guns and bombs, or we can spend them on infrastructure, roads, bridges, hospitals and schools.
[02:40:21.546 --> 02:40:22.867]  And President Trump knows this.
[02:40:23.328 --> 02:40:25.710]  As I told you, I became extremely ill.
[02:40:26.551 --> 02:40:33.734]  This manifested itself in over 14 days of high fevers, delirium, night sweats.
[02:40:34.615 --> 02:40:38.316]  I had lesions on my chest and my face.
[02:40:39.437 --> 02:40:42.398]  I had extreme diarrhea.
[02:40:42.958 --> 02:40:47.040]  I had vomiting that could not be stopped with medication.
[02:40:47.741 --> 02:40:50.202]  I became exceedingly dehydrated.
[02:40:50.822 --> 02:40:57.404]  And I ultimately had to be hydrated with IV and saline injection.
[02:40:57.424 --> 02:41:00.185]  And as you said, the last time you were in the hospital was when you were born.
[02:41:00.506 --> 02:41:02.866]  Yes, I am a generally healthy person.
[02:41:02.886 --> 02:41:04.247]  You're a marathon runner, hold on.
[02:41:04.827 --> 02:41:06.368]  I have been a runner and a weightlifter.
[02:41:06.728 --> 02:41:08.729]  I am very careful in my diet.
[02:41:09.209 --> 02:41:11.490]  I'm a user of the InfoWars supplements.
[02:41:12.090 --> 02:41:14.511]  I have been treated with acupuncture.
[02:41:15.151 --> 02:41:22.076]  By perhaps the greatest acupuncturist in the state of Florida, if not the United States, Dr. Quinn Martielli, who was trained in China.
[02:41:22.997 --> 02:41:24.398]  I'm generally a healthy person.
[02:41:25.318 --> 02:41:37.547]  In the beginning, I thought I had a routine stomach virus, and this was, you know, a pain in the neck, given my deadline on the book and the fact that my entire family was headed to Florida for Christmas.
[02:41:37.587 --> 02:41:40.289]  And we even had to cancel one of our important meetings we were going to have in Florida.
[02:41:40.709 --> 02:41:41.270]  Yes, indeed.
[02:41:41.430 --> 02:41:43.471]  So, I ultimately went
[02:41:44.312 --> 02:41:52.219]  To the doctors at Mount Sinai Hospital in Miami Beach, my own personal physician, they conducted extensive blood tests.
[02:41:52.660 --> 02:41:55.322]  Those blood tests were passed on to CDC.
[02:41:55.943 --> 02:41:58.685]  The general consensus is that I was poisoned.
[02:41:59.526 --> 02:42:07.151]  I was poisoned with, they now say, a substance that may have been polonium or had the characteristics of polonium.
[02:42:08.472 --> 02:42:10.353]  This made me exceedingly ill.
[02:42:11.114 --> 02:42:21.400]  The conjecture of all the doctors was that I did not receive a large enough dose to kill me, but I have never been this ill.
[02:42:21.981 --> 02:42:24.843]  Now, who would want to do this to me?
[02:42:26.153 --> 02:42:28.313]  I am an enemy of the deep state.
[02:42:28.514 --> 02:42:29.514]  I think people know that.
[02:42:30.134 --> 02:42:32.314]  I was an insider in American politics.
[02:42:32.454 --> 02:42:37.155]  I was close to power in nine presidential elections.
[02:42:37.855 --> 02:42:40.176]  Everything Glenn Greenwald says is true.
[02:42:40.836 --> 02:42:48.718]  The Republican, Democrat, Bush, Clinton, deep state has manufactured this Russian fraud.
[02:42:49.338 --> 02:42:55.319]  They have compounded it by taking a clearly fabricated document.
[02:42:55.999 --> 02:43:10.374]  A document that has traced to a political consulting firm, Fusion, which was pushing this, to a gentleman, Christopher Steele, who created this fabricated document.
[02:43:11.575 --> 02:43:15.820]  They're admitting that Jeb Bush was financing this, but also others.
[02:43:16.060 --> 02:43:17.021]  What's your intel on that?
[02:43:17.762 --> 02:43:26.994]  I believe that this document was actually financed by Dan Senor, who is a neocon lackey of Mitt Romney.
[02:43:28.055 --> 02:43:33.122]  I believe that this piece of poison, this total falsehood,
[02:43:34.143 --> 02:43:39.726]  Uh, about Donald Trump, uh, has, was peddled to every reporter in the country.
[02:43:39.766 --> 02:43:41.667]  Was this released as Romney's revenge?
[02:43:41.687 --> 02:43:44.649]  Uh, I think this was Romney's revenge.
[02:43:44.689 --> 02:43:48.831]  And the irony of this, of course, Alex, is had Donald Trump selected
[02:43:49.571 --> 02:43:50.231]  Mitt Romney.
[02:43:50.772 --> 02:43:55.173]  Mr. Senor probably would have been the number two man at the State Department.
[02:43:55.253 --> 02:43:57.434]  Now, there is treachery.
[02:43:57.474 --> 02:44:05.237]  By the way, Senor was also implicated in the release of the Billy Bush NBC attack on Trump.
[02:44:05.437 --> 02:44:09.859]  By the way, I mean, I want to get into why they do this, the polonium, how big a deal this is.
[02:44:10.219 --> 02:44:13.360]  It was a sensation when it happened to Alexander Levinenko.
[02:44:13.860 --> 02:44:19.366]  And then of course, it's sort of coming out even in the British news that it was probably a false flag by British intelligence to blame the Russians.
[02:44:19.426 --> 02:44:21.068]  Why would they poison this guy?
[02:44:21.128 --> 02:44:25.032]  Well, because he was a triple agent and it was useful to then demonize Russia.
[02:44:25.573 --> 02:44:28.936]  Clearly, let's get into motives in all of this.
[02:44:29.337 --> 02:44:30.638]  And I mean, how rare this is.
[02:44:30.678 --> 02:44:34.743]  Polonium, there's no such polonium like substance, polonium.
[02:44:36.618 --> 02:44:41.260]  Now obviously the deep state's trying to back off that because this is so sensational it didn't kill you.
[02:44:41.620 --> 02:44:45.682]  Now you will be able to testify in Congress when they're demonizing you.
[02:44:46.603 --> 02:44:49.644]  By a stroke of luck, I guess you didn't drink the full drink or the full potion.
[02:44:49.664 --> 02:44:51.345]  I know, you know, the doctors don't know.
[02:44:52.185 --> 02:44:54.206]  But this is just simply incredible.
[02:44:54.346 --> 02:44:55.687]  I mean, let's walk through the math here.
[02:44:56.027 --> 02:44:58.728]  The Machiavellian calculus, the stratagems.
[02:44:59.188 --> 02:45:00.689]  Why would they want to get rid of you?
[02:45:00.749 --> 02:45:03.590]  Obviously, they don't want you to be able to testify when you're being demonized.
[02:45:03.630 --> 02:45:05.411]  But also, there's an obsession with you.
[02:45:05.431 --> 02:45:06.552]  And I know who you were.
[02:45:06.612 --> 02:45:07.692]  I met you at a JFK deal.
[02:45:08.052 --> 02:45:08.632]  OK, great.
[02:45:09.533 --> 02:45:12.954]  But then about, I guess, two years ago, we actually met in person for the second time.
[02:45:12.994 --> 02:45:14.195]  And you came in studio.
[02:45:14.215 --> 02:45:17.937]  But reading about you, checking into you, obviously, as I did years ago.
[02:45:18.857 --> 02:45:27.185]  New York Times articles, Washington Post articles, Washington Times articles, hundreds of them that you're in, People magazine, just all sorts of New Yorker magazine.
[02:45:28.061 --> 02:45:29.542]  Where they're like, look at this guy.
[02:45:29.602 --> 02:45:32.844]  He's the guy that got, you know, Nixon back into politics.
[02:45:33.304 --> 02:45:37.946]  He's the guy that got Reagan to meet with Trump and envisioned this thing from the start.
[02:45:39.467 --> 02:45:45.971]  And so they see you as this key guy that recognizes talent and is at key juncture points over and over again.
[02:45:46.391 --> 02:45:52.795]  And so reading and then even getting the WikiLeaks, which we're both in, but also in the same email, but also getting
[02:45:53.975 --> 02:45:54.916]  Alex, I'm not really sure.
[02:45:54.956 --> 02:46:00.881]  Perhaps the fact that I am effective on behalf of my beliefs has something to do with it.
[02:46:18.072 --> 02:46:32.660]  During this past campaign, a half dozen reporters, New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, people I trust, people I think are honest, straight reporters, no bias, try to report it as they see it.
[02:46:32.780 --> 02:46:33.600]  Yes, there are some.
[02:46:33.620 --> 02:46:34.741]  In fact, there's many.
[02:46:36.282 --> 02:46:43.846]  At least three reporters who had spent actual time with both Bill and Hillary Clinton told me, these people hate you.
[02:46:44.758 --> 02:46:45.858]  And I said, yeah, I know that.
[02:46:46.038 --> 02:46:47.619]  It has to do with my book, Imagine.
[02:46:47.659 --> 02:46:48.999]  They said, no, no, you don't understand.
[02:46:49.540 --> 02:46:51.160]  They are obsessed with you.
[02:46:51.700 --> 02:46:53.001]  They despise you.
[02:46:53.581 --> 02:46:55.482]  They want to know what you're doing.
[02:46:56.742 --> 02:47:07.526]  A friend of mine, whose wife works for Hillary, told me that they gave her my book, she took it into the bedroom one night, and they could hear her shrieking.
[02:47:08.467 --> 02:47:15.592]  That son of a bitch, that no good, I can't say it on your show, starts with a C, son of a bitch.
[02:47:16.132 --> 02:47:23.858]  So, Alex, these people despise me because I helped expose them, but I don't think it was them, I must tell you.
[02:47:24.438 --> 02:47:26.640]  I also... Well, let's just say it, let's just say it.
[02:47:27.020 --> 02:47:29.582]  They think you are Trump's brain, which you're not.
[02:47:29.622 --> 02:47:30.743]  You are part of his brain.
[02:47:34.185 --> 02:47:34.385]  No.
[02:47:34.605 --> 02:47:37.167]  Alex, I am a loyal supporter of Donald Trump.
[02:47:37.727 --> 02:47:46.131]  I have thought since 1988 he had the size and the guts to take on a system that I saw getting increasingly rotten.
[02:47:46.151 --> 02:47:46.972]  Yeah, but let's admit it.
[02:47:47.012 --> 02:47:53.775]  He even admits you're the main booster, the main guy, you got him with Reagan, you pushed him, he's been very humble 30 years ago.
[02:47:53.835 --> 02:47:54.956]  I mean, Trump will give you credit.
[02:47:55.136 --> 02:47:56.357]  You're not his brain, I'm saying.
[02:47:56.637 --> 02:48:00.579]  You're somebody he bounces stuff off of, so they're going after Trump's biggest supporters.
[02:48:01.379 --> 02:48:04.461]  I am just fortunate to have been here on the sidelines.
[02:48:04.561 --> 02:48:05.822]  He's the one who got elected.
[02:48:06.242 --> 02:48:09.684]  He's the one who's had the courage to take on the system.
[02:48:09.744 --> 02:48:10.645]  No doubt, no doubt.
[02:48:10.765 --> 02:48:22.652]  I'm saying from their perspective... Well, we saw the WikiLeaks in which they pointed out my involvement in the recount and that I was now with Trump and that that was a problem.
[02:48:23.772 --> 02:48:26.234]  I don't need to tell you that David Brock
[02:48:27.074 --> 02:48:30.358]  Uh, and Media Matters for America and George Soros.
[02:48:31.079 --> 02:48:32.321]  God knows what they spent.
[02:48:32.341 --> 02:48:42.613]  30, 40, 50 million dollars attacking me relentlessly from everything for the color of my socks, uh, to things I allegedly said.
[02:48:43.234 --> 02:48:47.435]  You can still go on Twitter now and you see their mindless bots cranking it out.
[02:48:47.915 --> 02:48:49.395]  Stone knew everything in advance.
[02:48:49.776 --> 02:48:57.517]  Stone and Manafort and some guy named Page, who I've never heard of, worked for the Russians, met with the Russians.
[02:48:57.857 --> 02:49:00.558]  I can say privately, we've talked about Assange.
[02:49:01.098 --> 02:49:02.718]  All media tries to get a hold of him.
[02:49:03.019 --> 02:49:05.819]  You're like, I've got a contact, you know, someone that knows him.
[02:49:05.839 --> 02:49:08.940]  You know, as a journalist, I'm trying to, you know, get, you know,
[02:49:09.420 --> 02:49:10.881]  Get info to him, or get info.
[02:49:11.261 --> 02:49:12.942]  I mean, that's what everybody tries to do with Assange.
[02:49:13.002 --> 02:49:15.343]  I mean, every news agency out there does what you do.
[02:49:15.784 --> 02:49:16.944]  I mean, this is just crazy.
[02:49:17.324 --> 02:49:25.169]  Yeah, no, my trying to find out what Assange was up to is part of my, you know, journalistic and activist mission.
[02:49:25.189 --> 02:49:28.311]  Sure, who wasn't asking what Assange was going to release next?
[02:49:29.091 --> 02:49:43.853]  But this most recent attack on Trump, the fabricated memo, the claim that he was entertained by prostitutes in Moscow, I know for an absolute fact
[02:49:44.642 --> 02:49:53.474]  From one of the trusted and loyal and really outstanding security people who works for Donald Trump.
[02:49:54.155 --> 02:50:00.864]  This man is a decorated police officer in his prior career and a man of enormous integrity.
[02:50:01.445 --> 02:50:19.365]  He told me that one of the contacts that was kind of assigned as a walker for Trump, who they believed worked for the government, told the security guard that he would send a couple of ladies up to the room for Mr. Trump's enjoyment later in the evening after the program.
[02:50:20.446 --> 02:50:22.607]  And this security guard said, the hell you will.
[02:50:23.007 --> 02:50:24.027]  You will not do that.
[02:50:24.387 --> 02:50:26.728]  You will send nobody to Mr. Trump's room.
[02:50:26.768 --> 02:50:28.209]  He is not interested.
[02:50:28.729 --> 02:50:41.233]  Now, I also know that there were security guards posted outside Donald's door and at the front and the rear of the hotel to be certain that there would be no illicit effort to do this.
[02:50:41.793 --> 02:50:46.234]  Donald Trump, as he said himself in his press conference, Alex, far too savvy.
[02:50:46.274 --> 02:50:47.435]  Well, I mean, I mean, listen, listen.
[02:50:49.023 --> 02:50:54.247]  You're out at a political event and a guy shows up with hot chicks and says, here they are.
[02:50:54.327 --> 02:50:55.108]  It's happened to me.
[02:50:55.408 --> 02:50:56.669]  You're being set up.
[02:50:57.090 --> 02:50:59.432]  Donald Trump's all about being in control.
[02:50:59.732 --> 02:51:01.714]  He would never do something like that.
[02:51:01.974 --> 02:51:02.935]  This is so insane.
[02:51:03.255 --> 02:51:04.076]  You own a business.
[02:51:04.096 --> 02:51:04.837]  You own a company.
[02:51:04.857 --> 02:51:06.158]  You run a major operation.
[02:51:06.458 --> 02:51:10.722]  You wouldn't be around 10 minutes if you were having hookers pee on you.
[02:51:10.982 --> 02:51:12.243]  Then let's expand on this.
[02:51:13.084 --> 02:51:15.105]  I don't look into personal stuff, but you know Trump really well.
[02:51:15.145 --> 02:51:16.885]  You've been his friend.
[02:51:16.925 --> 02:51:17.925]  He's at your wedding.
[02:51:17.945 --> 02:51:19.266]  You were at his parents' funeral.
[02:51:19.486 --> 02:51:20.046]  Got photos.
[02:51:20.106 --> 02:51:21.106]  In fact, let's pull some of those up.
[02:51:21.366 --> 02:51:23.807]  You know, you had, well, Trump at your wedding.
[02:51:24.707 --> 02:51:25.387]  This is crazy.
[02:51:25.587 --> 02:51:26.628]  He's a germaphobe.
[02:51:26.848 --> 02:51:27.828]  Let's just be honest.
[02:51:28.288 --> 02:51:29.288]  Let's just talk about it.
[02:51:29.588 --> 02:51:31.649]  This is the biggest load of crap ever produced.
[02:51:32.284 --> 02:51:34.107]  Yeah, look, he's a fastidious guy.
[02:51:34.187 --> 02:51:36.470]  He would never put himself into that position.
[02:51:36.490 --> 02:51:38.894]  He is way too private and way too savvy.
[02:51:39.775 --> 02:51:41.778]  He is a family man.
[02:51:42.239 --> 02:51:43.621]  He is very happily married.
[02:51:43.721 --> 02:51:46.805]  He's dedicated to his young son, Barron, and his family.
[02:51:47.606 --> 02:51:48.967]  Did he have his playboy days?
[02:51:49.427 --> 02:51:49.928]  You bet.
[02:51:50.428 --> 02:51:51.148]  He was single.
[02:51:51.869 --> 02:51:52.849]  And he was a billionaire.
[02:51:53.250 --> 02:51:54.510]  And he was in New York City.
[02:51:55.611 --> 02:51:57.632]  So, look, I'm proud to be his friend.
[02:51:58.033 --> 02:52:02.375]  These attacks on me relate to my support for him.
[02:52:02.495 --> 02:52:07.118]  Now, let's go to the question of who would try to stop my book.
[02:52:07.539 --> 02:52:11.041]  Who doesn't want me to testify in upcoming hearings?
[02:52:12.061 --> 02:52:13.983]  I reject the idea that this is the Clintons.
[02:52:14.003 --> 02:52:17.305]  They would probably like to kill me, but I don't think it is them.
[02:52:18.066 --> 02:52:23.129]  I also don't think that there's any reason whatsoever for the Russians to want to whack me.
[02:52:23.770 --> 02:52:25.871]  There's nothing to cover up or hide or bury.
[02:52:25.891 --> 02:52:27.652]  I do not work for them.
[02:52:28.073 --> 02:52:29.314]  I have never worked for them.
[02:52:29.814 --> 02:52:31.295]  I have no Russian contacts.
[02:52:31.615 --> 02:52:32.576]  I have no Russian money.
[02:52:32.596 --> 02:52:34.077]  I have no Russian clients.
[02:52:34.437 --> 02:52:35.898]  I have no Russian influences.
[02:52:35.918 --> 02:52:37.760]  I am an anti-communist.
[02:52:37.780 --> 02:52:39.281]  That's how I got into politics.
[02:52:39.821 --> 02:52:40.842]  I hate their system.
[02:52:40.962 --> 02:52:43.404]  It's still totalitarianism.
[02:52:43.924 --> 02:52:47.347]  But that doesn't mean I want World War III with them.
[02:52:48.188 --> 02:52:49.529]  They have nuclear weapons.
[02:52:50.009 --> 02:52:51.591]  They have biological weapons.
[02:52:52.612 --> 02:52:55.414]  Putin is a KGB killer.
[02:52:56.415 --> 02:53:00.578]  But it still doesn't mean that I want to commit U.S.
[02:53:00.658 --> 02:53:02.440]  lives and borrowed U.S.
[02:53:02.520 --> 02:53:05.822]  dollars to a war over Syria.
[02:53:08.802 --> 02:53:12.873]  Where neither Assad, propping up Hezbollah and worse,
[02:53:13.812 --> 02:53:15.032]  And backed up by the Russians.
[02:53:15.573 --> 02:53:16.233]  Or ISIS.
[02:53:16.793 --> 02:53:18.354]  Backed up by the Saudis.
[02:53:19.074 --> 02:53:19.794]  Not our friends.
[02:53:20.454 --> 02:53:21.595]  We have no stake here.
[02:53:22.095 --> 02:53:24.776]  A no-fly zone in Syria.
[02:53:24.816 --> 02:53:25.896]  Roger, I gotta hand it to you.
[02:53:25.916 --> 02:53:27.717]  I mean, I also looked this up when you told me about it.
[02:53:27.737 --> 02:53:28.597]  It was in the news at the time.
[02:53:28.637 --> 02:53:29.277]  It's about there.
[02:53:29.818 --> 02:53:33.179]  You actually had Russian agents back when you were in the Reagan administration approach you.
[02:53:33.739 --> 02:53:34.839]  You went and called the FBI.
[02:53:34.859 --> 02:53:35.740]  They rolled them up.
[02:53:35.900 --> 02:53:38.701]  So, everybody knows you're a patriotic citizen.
[02:53:39.361 --> 02:53:52.636]  Now we've got Maxine Waters running around saying that Trump, in fact let's cue that up if we can, literally gets his orders from the Kremlin, from Putin directly.
[02:53:52.736 --> 02:53:58.523]  I mean, they're now hitting levels that are so comical, it'd be funny if it wasn't so serious.
[02:53:58.823 --> 02:54:00.024]  Do they believe this crap?
[02:54:00.064 --> 02:54:00.405]  Here it is.
[02:54:01.076 --> 02:54:14.123]  If we find out that somebody on behalf of Donald Trump was on the phone or in email relations with somebody in Russia, or the ambassador to America from Russia, and there was some sort of, as you call it, collusion, then what?
[02:54:14.223 --> 02:54:16.624]  Does that make Trump subject to impeachment?
[02:54:16.664 --> 02:54:18.045]  What do you mean by not legitimate?
[02:54:18.405 --> 02:54:19.926]  Just generally, what do you mean by the term?
[02:54:20.646 --> 02:54:23.987]  Well, here's what I'm... If you find out there was a connection, there was collusion, your turn.
[02:54:24.548 --> 02:54:26.489]  Well, here's what I'm trying to get to.
[02:54:26.749 --> 02:54:39.274]  If we discover that Donald Trump or his advocates played a role in helping to devise strategy, if they're the ones who came up with Crooked Hillary, if they're the ones who came up...
[02:54:39.774 --> 02:54:50.479]  She's ill, something's wrong with her energy, and the way that he basically, you know, described her in the campaign, I think that is something that... That's enough.
[02:54:50.659 --> 02:54:57.583]  I don't know who's more doddering, nothing against old women, but this is like obscene, crazy, old, arrogant, corrupt women.
[02:54:57.623 --> 02:55:07.688]  I mean, her and Nancy Pelosi, in the whole ethics investigations, are two of the most corrupt, in my view, just filthy, horrible, career politician, limousine liberal, race pimp.
[02:55:08.948 --> 02:55:09.408]  Harpies.
[02:55:10.269 --> 02:55:11.550]  And it goes on and on.
[02:55:11.570 --> 02:55:12.391]  It's like five minutes long.
[02:55:12.411 --> 02:55:13.652]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[02:55:13.872 --> 02:55:14.332]  It's incredible.
[02:55:15.713 --> 02:55:28.743]  Ladies and gentlemen, you have to understand, the Russians now feed Trump directly everything, and if the Russians even said something to Trump, he should have to step down, because the Russians are all powerful, and now you can see it.
[02:55:28.964 --> 02:55:30.485]  Roger, correct me if I'm wrong laying this out.
[02:55:31.707 --> 02:55:40.096]  There's no evidence whatsoever of the communication, so the outrageous... Hold on, I've got a question, but I've got to get it from... Yes, Putin, what do I say?
[02:55:40.816 --> 02:55:43.719]  Roger, let's get into why they'd want to blame the Russians.
[02:55:43.839 --> 02:55:45.201]  Yes, yes, comrade, I'm sorry.
[02:55:45.221 --> 02:55:50.466]  No, no, seriously, let's talk about this briefly, and you're going to be host of the next hour, so I hope to host some with you, but I don't have the time.
[02:55:50.806 --> 02:55:51.086]  Roger.
[02:55:51.767 --> 02:55:52.969]  Let's talk about polonium.
[02:55:53.230 --> 02:55:54.732]  I mean, you're not talking about yourself here.
[02:55:54.753 --> 02:55:55.674]  This is so rare.
[02:55:56.055 --> 02:55:58.740]  Only state sponsors can create this.
[02:55:59.140 --> 02:56:00.603]  What is the message that's being sent?
[02:56:00.663 --> 02:56:01.044]  It's clear.
[02:56:01.364 --> 02:56:02.546]  Get you out of the committee, Harrys.
[02:56:03.908 --> 02:56:16.758]  It's so clear, get you out of the committee hearings, kill you, get rid of you, and then think the public's so dumb, go, look, they poisoned their other spy, Litvinenko, and now they've gotten rid of their other spy before he could testify.
[02:56:17.059 --> 02:56:18.640]  They think the public's that dumb.
[02:56:18.760 --> 02:56:24.965]  I'm telling you, that's why they did this, and I'll tell you, I think Hillary and I think the globalists are the main suspects.
[02:56:25.465 --> 02:56:25.685]  Go ahead.
[02:56:25.705 --> 02:56:28.287]  Well, Alex, I have to tell you, like Craig Murray,
[02:56:29.448 --> 02:56:48.297]  Like Steve Pichinik, and crusading journalists like Glenn Greenwald, who is not a conservative, who is not a Trump fan by any means, but who has shed light on this in a way that the New York Times and the Washington Post have not.
[02:56:49.796 --> 02:56:53.798]  I'm a whistleblower, and perhaps I'm a threat, but this isn't about me.
[02:56:54.538 --> 02:56:57.699]  This is about stopping the Trump agenda.
[02:56:57.779 --> 02:57:04.701]  Now, I was on with Bill Maher, and Maxine Waters was a guest on that show.
[02:57:05.221 --> 02:57:06.442]  She's a very nice lady.
[02:57:07.483 --> 02:57:17.274]  When she came out and said the Bushes and the Clintons trafficked cocaine through Mina, the left-wing said, oh, she's just a crazy, you know, batshit crazy old lady.
[02:57:17.834 --> 02:57:21.598]  But her supposition here is way out of line.
[02:57:22.199 --> 02:57:24.942]  Donald Trump came up with Crooked Hillary.
[02:57:25.322 --> 02:57:25.582]  How?
[02:57:26.243 --> 02:57:27.944]  He's familiar with her record.
[02:57:28.404 --> 02:57:31.585]  Donald Trump came up with his strategy.
[02:57:31.865 --> 02:57:35.906]  Donald Trump coined the slogan, Make America Great Again.
[02:57:36.267 --> 02:57:40.328]  Donald Trump is the master of his own agenda.
[02:57:40.468 --> 02:57:41.528]  Well that's another joke!
[02:57:41.889 --> 02:57:47.050]  So the Russians want to make us great, have more guns, control our borders, and cut our taxes?
[02:57:47.370 --> 02:57:49.651]  Man, then sign me up to be a Russian spy then!
[02:57:49.671 --> 02:57:51.452]  This is so ridiculous!
[02:57:51.992 --> 02:58:00.160]  So I have to presume that these upcoming hearings, perhaps, they think my testimony would be problematic.
[02:58:00.781 --> 02:58:07.668]  I would blow the whistle on this whole bogus Russian narrative that they just won't let go of.
[02:58:07.728 --> 02:58:08.849]  Now, John Lewis.
[02:58:10.458 --> 02:58:11.138]  John Lewis.
[02:58:11.238 --> 02:58:11.979]  Hold on, hold on.
[02:58:11.999 --> 02:58:12.279]  Stay there.
[02:58:12.299 --> 02:58:13.879]  You've got the whole hour coming up.
[02:58:14.059 --> 02:58:18.181]  And I can do 5 minutes with you, 10 minutes with you, 20, or I can punch out and let you take over.
[02:58:18.441 --> 02:58:19.181]  Tell me during the break.
[02:58:19.221 --> 02:58:24.163]  But Roger normally hosts on Tuesdays, sometimes Wednesdays, in the fourth hour.
[02:58:24.203 --> 02:58:26.964]  So Roger Stone's coming up here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:58:27.024 --> 02:58:27.704]  And soon we're going to cut.
[02:58:28.064 --> 02:58:31.047]  Liners for all the other hosts so they can meet their show when they're doing it.
[02:58:31.067 --> 02:58:32.448]  They'll just move to the hour after that.
[02:58:32.988 --> 02:58:35.450]  But it's a very, very exciting time to be alive, folks.
[02:58:35.490 --> 02:58:37.492]  And this guy's a hero for this republic.
[02:58:37.512 --> 02:58:38.853]  He's been targeted by globalists.
[02:58:39.194 --> 02:58:40.235]  This is sensational.
[02:58:40.655 --> 02:58:42.416]  The media's going to have a lot of trouble ignoring this.
[02:58:43.097 --> 02:58:43.758]  They didn't get him!
[02:58:45.140 --> 02:58:48.061]  They didn't hit him with five shots and they still didn't get him.
[02:58:48.081 --> 02:58:48.982]  That's bad luck for them.
[02:58:49.422 --> 02:58:50.803]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:58:51.063 --> 02:58:52.363]  You can't survive without it.
[02:58:52.543 --> 02:58:53.444]  But where do you get it?
[02:58:53.744 --> 02:58:59.526]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[02:58:59.746 --> 02:59:05.469]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[02:59:05.649 --> 02:59:22.519]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new gravity block core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[02:59:22.899 --> 02:59:25.040]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[02:59:25.380 --> 02:59:26.580]  Stainless steel construction.
[02:59:26.860 --> 02:59:27.640]  Easy assembly.
[02:59:27.901 --> 02:59:28.521]  Low maintenance.
[02:59:28.801 --> 02:59:30.641]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[02:59:50.239 --> 02:59:54.364]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:54.884 --> 02:59:56.226]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:02.412 --> 03:00:03.874]  We are on the march.
[03:00:04.254 --> 03:00:06.657]  The Empire is on the run.
[03:00:07.438 --> 03:00:11.042]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:23.380 --> 03:00:25.601]  Okay, so Roger Stone is a humble guy.
[03:00:25.621 --> 03:00:28.343]  I've gotten to know him really good in the last two years.
[03:00:29.023 --> 03:00:30.624]  Everything he's told me has been dead on.
[03:00:31.784 --> 03:00:37.007]  And he really has a lot of savvy for understanding and thin-slicing the larger picture.
[03:00:38.208 --> 03:00:40.629]  And the establishment really hates his guts.
[03:00:40.709 --> 03:00:44.711]  In fact, it's admitted that they got him banned off Fox, CNN, MSNBC.
[03:00:44.731 --> 03:00:45.331]  That was in the news.
[03:00:45.731 --> 03:00:46.592]  He's been banned.
[03:00:49.065 --> 03:01:02.730]  And now they've tried to ban him off the internet, and now they're using his name and my name and Matt Drudge's name, talking about banning fake news off the web, and they actually have Brian Williams, the mogul, or the guru of fake news, calling for it.
[03:01:03.790 --> 03:01:08.932]  And then fake actors playing fake newscasters, Stephen Colbert, calling for us to be banned.
[03:01:09.812 --> 03:01:15.254]  So, the deep states calling for us to be banned, we're under attack trying to wrest America away from globalists.
[03:01:16.069 --> 03:01:18.591]  They're saying, you know, somebody needs to do something about Roger Stone.
[03:01:18.931 --> 03:01:23.654]  The Clintons have this long history of killing people, or their minions doing it.
[03:01:25.055 --> 03:01:33.301]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up, then I'm going to hand things over to you at about 15 after, but Roger, I know you don't like to speculate, but I mean, you've been sitting there, you've known about this for weeks.
[03:01:33.801 --> 03:01:35.402]  Polonium poisoning, it's big.
[03:01:35.983 --> 03:01:42.587]  Let's talk about you, let's talk about why you're, I mean, I'm not trying to put you down, I mean, I can physically see that you've been sick.
[03:01:42.847 --> 03:01:44.348]  We've seen the photos, what it did to you.
[03:01:46.405 --> 03:01:49.037]  It really hit you hard, and I know it has long-term effects.
[03:01:49.960 --> 03:01:51.286]  Just other points on polonium.
[03:01:52.722 --> 03:02:00.446]  Well, look, we get down to the fundamental question of who would have done this and why, and I come back to the deep state.
[03:02:00.546 --> 03:02:02.488]  I come back to our own people.
[03:02:02.908 --> 03:02:06.150]  The Russians have no motive to kill me.
[03:02:06.210 --> 03:02:10.172]  They have nothing to hide or cover, as far as I am concerned.
[03:02:10.592 --> 03:02:20.678]  And I am not aware of any contact between the Russians and my colleague of many years, Paul Manafort, and the entire canard about
[03:02:22.193 --> 03:02:26.757]  His activities in the Ukraine and his taking a 12 million dollar payment.
[03:02:27.177 --> 03:02:34.764]  Politico has recently reported, Ken Vogel specifically, that that is now thought to have been bogus.
[03:02:35.325 --> 03:02:38.307]  It was a fake handwritten ledger they found on the side of the street.
[03:02:38.387 --> 03:02:39.068]  I mean, give me a break.
[03:02:39.268 --> 03:02:46.855]  It was manufactured by Ukrainian intelligence in an effort to undermine... Who now have been caught campaigning and giving money to Hillary.
[03:02:47.595 --> 03:03:01.358]  So this is part and parcel of a greater effort to destabilize President Trump as he tries to bring drastic change.
[03:03:03.082 --> 03:03:18.354]  There was an excellent report on WBAI in New York, a progressive station, about Trump's comments regarding reforming the CIA, cutting the number of agents at Langley, building a system that is more responsive.
[03:03:18.974 --> 03:03:23.958]  The CIA has been associated with some of the greatest atrocities and lies
[03:03:24.699 --> 03:03:26.340]  Of the last 40 years.
[03:03:26.360 --> 03:03:33.004]  And they're famous for poisoning people, so you're clearly saying rogue elements of that are obviously suspect.
[03:03:33.044 --> 03:03:40.749]  They've been in the news warning Trump and the Associated Press and Reuters and the New York Observer of all places, his son-in-law's paper.
[03:03:41.070 --> 03:03:41.910]  You better watch it.
[03:03:41.930 --> 03:03:43.931]  The intelligence agency can do things to you.
[03:03:44.192 --> 03:03:49.535]  Well then, if you've been good buddies with him for 41 years, then I think that's a message to Trump.
[03:03:49.795 --> 03:03:51.897]  Isn't this really a message to Donald Trump?
[03:03:52.617 --> 03:03:54.122]  Well, Alex, people who will.
[03:03:55.069 --> 03:04:00.671]  Torture people illegally and then lie about it will, of course, poison people.
[03:04:01.212 --> 03:04:03.993]  People who will cover up Benghazi.
[03:04:04.513 --> 03:04:07.635]  People who lied about Iran-Contra.
[03:04:08.095 --> 03:04:10.476]  People who lied about Vietnam.
[03:04:10.976 --> 03:04:14.077]  People who lied about the Kennedy assassination.
[03:04:15.258 --> 03:04:18.239]  People who lied about the Iraq War.
[03:04:18.980 --> 03:04:23.902]  These people will do anything to cover their record of malfeasance.
[03:04:24.742 --> 03:04:35.930]  And the idea that CIA Director John Brennan, a man who fused to be sworn on the Bible when sworn in, a man with a long history of activity in the U.S.
[03:04:36.290 --> 03:04:42.154]  Communist Party, the known jihadi, who insists that there is no connection between terrorism and Islam,
[03:04:42.955 --> 03:04:45.138]  Telling Donald Trump, you better watch your mouth.
[03:04:45.598 --> 03:04:46.980]  You better watch what you say.
[03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:48.121]  Yeah, he better watch his mouth.
[03:04:48.381 --> 03:04:48.922]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:48.962 --> 03:04:49.723]  It's an outrage.
[03:04:49.743 --> 03:04:50.264]  Stay there.
[03:04:50.284 --> 03:04:50.604]  Stay there.
[03:04:50.624 --> 03:04:51.705]  I'm going to come back and talk about this.
[03:04:51.986 --> 03:04:55.309]  Roger Stone's about to take over and host Hit With Polonium.
[03:04:56.070 --> 03:04:57.412]  Oh yeah, it's more than them four.
[03:04:57.452 --> 03:04:58.213]  They took the gloves off.
[03:04:59.048 --> 03:05:01.910]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here with the Inauguration Special.
[03:05:02.030 --> 03:05:05.493]  We've had some of the biggest sales in our history since Christmas into the New Year.
[03:05:05.753 --> 03:05:11.717]  I'm extending them as the Inauguration Specials right through this weekend and then it's over.
[03:05:11.957 --> 03:05:18.422]  We have some new products coming out next week, some other sales we're going to be doing, but many of these sales are going to have to come to an end.

[03:08:20.562 --> 03:08:24.464]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:24.904 --> 03:08:28.726]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:08:29.086 --> 03:08:30.667]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:42.013 --> 03:08:43.193]  Oh, the fighting's close at hand.
[03:08:43.233 --> 03:08:44.134]  He's been hit with polonium.
[03:08:57.659 --> 03:08:58.479]  What's the high command?
[03:08:59.160 --> 03:09:00.540]  People that are not to get ya.
[03:09:00.560 --> 03:09:02.001]  People that want prosperity and justice.
[03:09:02.741 --> 03:09:04.582]  There's more of us than there are of the psychopaths.
[03:09:05.742 --> 03:09:08.023]  But they have neutered us and it's time for humanity to rise.
[03:09:08.503 --> 03:09:11.585]  I've got other issues I want to hit with Stone before I hand the baton to him here.
[03:09:12.745 --> 03:09:14.706]  We're both getting on planes tomorrow and going to D.C.
[03:09:15.906 --> 03:09:16.947]  We have the deplorable.
[03:09:17.487 --> 03:09:22.009]  They're all over the news saying kill us, attack us, ban us.
[03:09:23.643 --> 03:09:28.104]  They're in every major newspaper I could think of, from Time Magazine to the New York Times.
[03:09:29.164 --> 03:09:29.564]  Letting.
[03:09:30.904 --> 03:09:31.324]  Letting.
[03:09:34.145 --> 03:09:35.025]  This is so amazing.
[03:09:36.185 --> 03:09:39.706]  People write op-eds saying, kill Donald Trump.
[03:09:41.966 --> 03:09:42.486]  Think about that.
[03:09:46.007 --> 03:09:50.208]  And then, of all places, at Comet Ping Pong Pizza in D.C.
[03:09:50.248 --> 03:09:50.948]  of Pizzagate,
[03:09:52.742 --> 03:09:59.568]  They're sniveling Soros operatives, Democrats meaning, who look like villains out of the Warriors movie.
[03:10:00.369 --> 03:10:03.391]  Come out and play Warriors!
[03:10:04.212 --> 03:10:15.562]  I mean, you couldn't get these dirt balls out of Central Casting talking about acid attack, which by the way is terrorism because it will cause people to stampede and die.
[03:10:15.582 --> 03:10:19.305]  And then you've got
[03:10:21.325 --> 03:10:32.320]  People out hiring for $2,500 for two days work to go be Soros operatives to, quote, shut down the inauguration and block roads, barricades, and burn stuff.
[03:10:32.660 --> 03:10:33.601]  Let me explain something.
[03:10:35.184 --> 03:10:36.265]  I don't like these tactics.
[03:10:36.365 --> 03:10:37.366]  I wouldn't use these tactics.
[03:10:38.971 --> 03:10:41.052]  I'm not saying, oh, I'd do this if I wouldn't get in trouble.
[03:10:41.272 --> 03:10:47.736]  The point is, if I called for people to burn things and to have barricades and to attack police, I would be arrested.
[03:10:47.916 --> 03:10:48.856]  Because that's not free speech.
[03:10:49.136 --> 03:10:52.218]  That's calling for civil insurrection.
[03:10:54.079 --> 03:11:01.023]  I have to sit here and watch the entire MSM, the dinosaur media, call for insurrection.
[03:11:03.379 --> 03:11:06.120]  And call for my head and Roger's head.
[03:11:06.621 --> 03:11:17.266]  I mean, I am a kinsman, or you could say someone who is a fellow traveler, to take the leftist term, with Donald Trump because I get to experience the demonization.
[03:11:17.566 --> 03:11:18.947]  I get to experience the death threats.
[03:11:19.207 --> 03:11:28.432]  I get to experience the lies, the cornucopia of disinformation and rotten, fetid trash that comes out of their stinking mall.
[03:11:30.635 --> 03:11:33.858]  I spend my life trying to really discover the truth and tell it.
[03:11:34.118 --> 03:11:47.828]  They spend their life in fantasy land, claiming I'm a Russian agent, Stone's a Russian agent, Trump's a Russian agent, and we can't come up with a term when we're looking at a big, fat, ugly, demonic pig and call Hillary a stinking pig!
[03:11:48.529 --> 03:11:52.272]  The Russians didn't tell me she's a big, demonic, stinking, corrupt pig!
[03:11:52.872 --> 03:11:54.093]  She's a stinking pig!
[03:11:54.513 --> 03:11:56.355]  She's a stinking, corrupt Hillary!
[03:11:57.716 --> 03:11:59.097]  And so is Nancy Pelosi.
[03:12:00.543 --> 03:12:09.187]  What is up with all these arrogant weirdo harpies, women in business suits, thinking they can dominate everybody and call us Russian agents, and we're not going to strike back?
[03:12:09.247 --> 03:12:09.928]  Take John Lewis.
[03:12:09.968 --> 03:12:10.708]  He got interrupted earlier.
[03:12:10.728 --> 03:12:12.189]  I want to hear about Congressman John Lewis.
[03:12:12.429 --> 03:12:14.750]  Comes out and says, Trump, you're a Russian agent.
[03:12:15.030 --> 03:12:15.950]  You didn't get elected.
[03:12:16.131 --> 03:12:16.931]  Forget the voters.
[03:12:16.991 --> 03:12:17.591]  None of you count.
[03:12:17.731 --> 03:12:18.532]  You're not legitimate.
[03:12:18.552 --> 03:12:19.392]  We should boycott it.
[03:12:19.592 --> 03:12:20.473]  He should be impeached.
[03:12:20.913 --> 03:12:22.574]  Trump says, I'd really like to work with you more.
[03:12:23.354 --> 03:12:27.259]  It's unfortunate that you're not helping people in your own area that are having massive unemployment.
[03:12:27.859 --> 03:12:28.480]  Oh my gosh!
[03:12:28.520 --> 03:12:30.663]  He was mean to an icon of civil rights!
[03:12:30.903 --> 03:12:31.724]  He's racist!
[03:12:32.185 --> 03:12:36.069]  I was in the airport this morning and yesterday and it was just newspapers everywhere!
[03:12:36.370 --> 03:12:40.655]  Trump racist attacks civil rights icon on Martin Luther King Day!
[03:12:42.580 --> 03:12:43.661]  You're a Russian agent!
[03:12:43.681 --> 03:12:44.401]  You're illegitimate!
[03:12:44.641 --> 03:12:45.662]  I'd like to work with you.
[03:12:46.403 --> 03:12:48.304]  Call me a racist!
[03:12:49.285 --> 03:12:52.527]  I mean, there's not even logic in their attacks now.
[03:12:53.027 --> 03:12:53.428]  Hold on.
[03:12:53.608 --> 03:12:53.928]  Hold on.
[03:12:53.968 --> 03:12:54.508]  Yes, Putin?
[03:12:54.889 --> 03:12:56.270]  Oh, Infowars.com.
[03:12:56.510 --> 03:12:56.830]  Be sure.
[03:12:56.850 --> 03:12:58.231]  We have a lot of specials that are ending.
[03:12:58.491 --> 03:12:58.831]  Thank you.
[03:12:58.971 --> 03:12:59.552]  Thank you, Putin.
[03:13:00.412 --> 03:13:01.173]  I couldn't think on my own.
[03:13:01.653 --> 03:13:03.755]  We got a bunch of specials I didn't plug last hour that end.
[03:13:04.926 --> 03:13:07.169]  This weekend, a lot of them come over from Christmas.
[03:13:07.849 --> 03:13:09.391]  We cut some of the specials, added some.
[03:13:09.611 --> 03:13:11.053]  These are the biggest specials we ever offer.
[03:13:11.073 --> 03:13:12.595]  And then we're going to Roger Stone right now.
[03:13:16.317 --> 03:13:23.019]  Supermail Vitality, Brain Force, Biome Defense, $50 billion per capsule is back in, by the way.
[03:13:23.039 --> 03:13:24.780]  A lot of stuff that was sold out is coming back in.
[03:13:25.300 --> 03:13:26.320]  Trump is my president.
[03:13:26.340 --> 03:13:27.741]  He's only in a few sizes left.
[03:13:28.081 --> 03:13:28.861]  Hillary for prison?
[03:13:29.101 --> 03:13:29.722]  Oh, which Putin?
[03:13:29.902 --> 03:13:30.162]  Putin!
[03:13:30.262 --> 03:13:31.322]  Oh, Hillary for prison!
[03:13:31.342 --> 03:13:31.942]  Great idea, sir!
[03:13:32.162 --> 03:13:32.683]  I'll get to Owen.
[03:13:32.843 --> 03:13:34.143]  How about deport Soros?
[03:13:34.383 --> 03:13:35.203]  Yes, Mr. Putin!
[03:13:35.423 --> 03:13:39.245]  I mean, it's crazy!
[03:13:40.205 --> 03:13:41.666]  We're teleprompter-free.
[03:13:41.946 --> 03:13:45.607]  Pelosi and everybody get orders from on top, so they can't imagine
[03:13:47.008 --> 03:13:52.271]  Or a Maxine Waters that Trump comes up with his own ideas, or Roger Stone does, because these are dumbass hacks.
[03:13:52.812 --> 03:13:55.373]  Just like the Politico guy that said, I'm a hack, I'm a fraud, I'll lie.
[03:13:55.593 --> 03:13:58.275]  They're like, oh, move you to the New York Times right now, buddy.
[03:13:58.775 --> 03:13:59.836]  They're not real people.
[03:13:59.916 --> 03:14:01.237]  They don't have a real ideology.
[03:14:01.437 --> 03:14:05.099]  They just take whatever lies they're given, and then go out on TV and spew bull.
[03:14:05.939 --> 03:14:06.600]  Getting back to my issue.
[03:14:07.950 --> 03:14:10.371]  Films, books, water filters, it's all the best.
[03:14:10.391 --> 03:14:16.512]  Storable food, great lowers for AR-15s, amazing nanotech body armor.
[03:14:16.752 --> 03:14:17.572]  It's all available.
[03:14:17.692 --> 03:14:20.693]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[03:14:20.753 --> 03:14:21.493]  Check out the books.
[03:14:21.813 --> 03:14:22.653]  Check out the films.
[03:14:22.733 --> 03:14:24.974]  Check out Chris Hedges' new book, Unspeakable.
[03:14:26.134 --> 03:14:27.654]  It's all there, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:14:27.774 --> 03:14:32.315]  Infowarsstore.com, and you're building this operation that's changing the world.
[03:14:32.595 --> 03:14:35.056]  And by the way, I love that nobody ever corrects me when I'm wrong around here.
[03:14:35.096 --> 03:14:35.716]  You really should.
[03:14:36.596 --> 03:14:43.219]  I remember telling Weldon a month ago, I want you to buy 10,000 of Roger Stone's new book and put it on pre-sale, which Skyhorse usually does.
[03:14:43.279 --> 03:14:44.279]  Great name, great publisher.
[03:14:45.460 --> 03:14:51.402]  And I'm on air going, get it at Amazon, get it at InfoWars, get it wherever you want, and then I learn we're not allowed to sell it until it actually comes out.
[03:14:52.623 --> 03:14:56.004]  Which is fine, but it's got to go to number one on the New York Times, because here's the deal.
[03:14:56.324 --> 03:15:01.546]  Stone during the break's like, I don't want to make this about me, okay, I got hit with polonium, can we stop talking about it, I don't want to talk about issues.
[03:15:01.566 --> 03:15:02.267]  And I'm like, Stone!
[03:15:03.067 --> 03:15:04.808]  You're a hero that you survived.
[03:15:04.848 --> 03:15:06.069]  You've gone through all this hell.
[03:15:06.109 --> 03:15:07.770]  We have to make a big deal out of this.
[03:15:07.970 --> 03:15:09.391]  They're freaking trying to kill you.
[03:15:09.671 --> 03:15:11.793]  If we don't make a big deal out of it, none of us are safe.
[03:15:12.253 --> 03:15:15.635]  Every journalist in the world ought to be flocking to this guy's support.
[03:15:15.655 --> 03:15:18.557]  Do you understand the crap we go through?
[03:15:18.757 --> 03:15:19.918]  And I'm not bitching.
[03:15:20.298 --> 03:15:24.841]  I'm just saying the bad guys are after us because we're hurting them and we're hurting them bad.
[03:15:25.836 --> 03:15:28.418]  And so, Roger, you say you don't want to get into yourself, you don't want to talk about yourself.
[03:15:28.679 --> 03:15:29.299]  This is big.
[03:15:29.319 --> 03:15:32.002]  You got poisoned with polonium so you couldn't testify.
[03:15:32.242 --> 03:15:33.022]  The motive's clear.
[03:15:33.183 --> 03:15:36.305]  They want to blame the Russians, just like they did with Alexander Litvinenko.
[03:15:36.345 --> 03:15:36.926]  That came out.
[03:15:37.106 --> 03:15:38.167]  That was British intelligence.
[03:15:38.407 --> 03:15:42.491]  You got British intelligence putting out these fake dossiers that Trump has women pissing on him.
[03:15:44.753 --> 03:15:52.160]  This deranged possum, Gloria Allred, coming out with more baloney, more fake lawsuits in my view.
[03:15:52.480 --> 03:15:53.941]  All these other lawsuits got dropped.
[03:15:54.182 --> 03:15:56.263]  I mean, this is an insane time to be alive, brother.
[03:15:56.544 --> 03:15:58.525]  And the fact is, you're a wounded soldier.
[03:15:58.786 --> 03:16:00.307]  You deserve a Purple Heart.
[03:16:00.567 --> 03:16:01.108]  You're tough.
[03:16:01.488 --> 03:16:04.229]  I feel bad even having you on air as sick as you've been, brother.
[03:16:04.629 --> 03:16:06.250]  So it's just incredible.
[03:16:06.290 --> 03:16:07.730]  So let's cover the waterfront.
[03:16:07.750 --> 03:16:09.171]  I'm going to skip this break so you have more time.
[03:16:09.391 --> 03:16:10.331]  Let's get into Lewis.
[03:16:10.591 --> 03:16:14.813]  Let's get into other points about who you really think is behind this and what we should do about it.
[03:16:14.913 --> 03:16:18.214]  Because we're not just going to go, okay, you got hit with polonium and move on.
[03:16:18.394 --> 03:16:19.074]  It's a big deal.
[03:16:19.294 --> 03:16:25.177]  They hit you with that so you couldn't testify, so your book wouldn't come out, and as a warning to Trump, that's the bottom line here.
[03:16:25.217 --> 03:16:25.517]  Go ahead.
[03:16:26.417 --> 03:16:27.618]  Alex, I'm going to be honest with you.
[03:16:28.078 --> 03:16:30.120]  I'm just very happy to be alive.
[03:16:30.720 --> 03:16:33.182]  I have never been this sick in my life.
[03:16:33.603 --> 03:16:35.984]  I've never experienced this level of illness.
[03:16:36.024 --> 03:16:36.725]  Yeah, you don't look good.
[03:16:37.346 --> 03:16:38.066]  Well, thank you.
[03:16:38.086 --> 03:16:40.488]  And you're a friend, and it pisses me off, but it's called empathy.
[03:16:40.688 --> 03:16:41.549]  They could do this to me.
[03:16:41.569 --> 03:16:42.630]  They could do it to my family.
[03:16:42.790 --> 03:16:43.070]  Go ahead.
[03:16:43.730 --> 03:16:46.693]  Alex, you know, I just thank God that I'm alive.
[03:16:47.433 --> 03:16:48.934]  President Nixon once told me
[03:16:49.915 --> 03:16:54.997]  Don't pray to God when it's raining if you don't pray when the sun is out.
[03:16:56.237 --> 03:17:02.239]  And laying in that bed drenched in sweat, and you know, out of my mind, I did pray.
[03:17:02.479 --> 03:17:04.399]  And I'm going to be also honest.
[03:17:05.139 --> 03:17:13.442]  They think that I may have saved myself because I did take a bunch of supplements before I knew
[03:17:14.102 --> 03:17:15.122]  What was wrong with me?
[03:17:16.002 --> 03:17:17.683]  Liver cleanse was among them.
[03:17:17.743 --> 03:17:21.284]  Your liver defense product, your DNA product.
[03:17:21.764 --> 03:17:23.284]  I wanted to flush my system.
[03:17:23.384 --> 03:17:31.366]  I drank a gallon of distilled water with liver shield, pardon me, which I think flushed my system.
[03:17:32.226 --> 03:17:34.507]  I used the silver collido
[03:17:35.327 --> 03:17:39.830]  By the way, we weren't planning this, so they're flashing up products as you say it.
[03:17:40.130 --> 03:17:44.192]  DNA Force with the BioPQQ does flush mitochondria out.
[03:17:44.512 --> 03:17:45.653]  It does flush the cells.
[03:17:46.553 --> 03:17:47.854]  So does the liver cleanse.
[03:17:47.934 --> 03:17:51.716]  Nobody should take the liver shell, though, if you're drinking on it, folks, because your liver is wide open.
[03:17:51.996 --> 03:17:53.037]  When you do it, it can really hurt you.
[03:17:53.217 --> 03:17:54.698]  This is a powerful product.
[03:17:54.978 --> 03:17:56.499]  I didn't even know you were going to plug this on air.
[03:17:57.139 --> 03:17:58.320]  Are you serious it really helps you?
[03:17:59.093 --> 03:18:02.836]  Well, now, I believe they helped me.
[03:18:02.916 --> 03:18:12.043]  Now, we know the attitude of Western doctors, some of them the unenlightened ones, towards non-pharmaceutical substances.
[03:18:12.103 --> 03:18:15.206]  This is one of the great problems with Western medicine.
[03:18:15.226 --> 03:18:17.448]  Well, I mean, liver shield makes your liver take a giant crap.
[03:18:17.468 --> 03:18:17.568]  Right.
[03:18:17.888 --> 03:18:19.049]  I mean, it just dumps everything out.
[03:18:19.069 --> 03:18:22.352]  So if your liver's getting hit with polonium, you're supposed to detox.
[03:18:22.412 --> 03:18:23.192]  It makes perfect sense.
[03:18:23.733 --> 03:18:24.573]  Or anything else.
[03:18:25.014 --> 03:18:27.276]  Also, it will make you very angry.
[03:18:27.816 --> 03:18:31.638]  When you take any liver product, everything comes up.
[03:18:32.278 --> 03:18:40.081]  And in Chinese medicine, it is believed that the liver is where you harbor all of your past resentments and your angers.
[03:18:41.122 --> 03:18:46.444]  And so you'll go through an emotional rollercoaster as your system just flushes all the crap.
[03:18:46.464 --> 03:18:51.927]  Well sure, the toxins are coming out and going out through what you're releasing, exactly.
[03:18:52.347 --> 03:18:56.889]  One particularly bright doctor at Mount Sinai said that
[03:18:57.609 --> 03:19:19.470]  There is, after some study and some investigation, that there is some evidence that if there is fat in your system, if you have a full stomach at the time that you absorb poisons, that the fat can leach the poison out of your system and you will... Now, I had an enormous steak two days before I was sick.
[03:19:20.647 --> 03:19:22.328]  Yes, I'm a conservative.
[03:19:22.749 --> 03:19:23.649]  I eat red meat.
[03:19:24.210 --> 03:19:25.231]  Virtually raw.
[03:19:25.691 --> 03:19:26.271]  I like it.
[03:19:26.712 --> 03:19:27.893]  And I'm going to keep eating it.
[03:19:28.493 --> 03:19:31.976]  But, that may also have been beneficial.
[03:19:32.256 --> 03:19:37.420]  Let's talk about the dose, because the media, I mean, obviously is going to try to spin this or whatever, or probably try to ignore it.
[03:19:37.460 --> 03:19:38.140]  It's so powerful.
[03:19:38.160 --> 03:19:39.261]  I mean, this is huge.
[03:19:39.721 --> 03:19:40.662]  What does this signify?
[03:19:40.702 --> 03:19:42.744]  Whoever did this, obviously it's globalist.
[03:19:43.244 --> 03:19:44.325]  I mean, the motives are all there.
[03:19:44.425 --> 03:19:45.446]  Kibona, who benefits.
[03:19:45.846 --> 03:19:46.647]  Why would they do this?
[03:19:47.327 --> 03:19:52.990]  Well, nobody wants me to testify before their phony congressional investigation.
[03:19:53.310 --> 03:19:57.493]  Because I will put the lie to this whole Russian canard.
[03:19:57.873 --> 03:20:05.377]  That they are so, the deep state and the intelligence agencies are so desperate they won't drop this theme.
[03:20:05.437 --> 03:20:11.221]  Now I point out to you Alex, it was a talking point for Hillary's talking heads before the election.
[03:20:12.547 --> 03:20:17.289]  The CIA Director Brennan warned of Russian hacking before it happens.
[03:20:17.449 --> 03:20:18.929]  Hold on, this gets worse, this gets worse.
[03:20:18.949 --> 03:20:19.649]  New York Post.
[03:20:19.830 --> 03:20:26.492]  The MI6 guy worked with the murdered Levanenko guy that got hit with polonium.
[03:20:26.952 --> 03:20:28.452]  I was already connecting the two.
[03:20:28.572 --> 03:20:29.993]  Holy Toledo Daily Mail.
[03:20:30.533 --> 03:20:36.878]  Out is the man behind the dirty dossier of Donald Trump, which they admit is now fake, worked with the double-triple agent.
[03:20:37.158 --> 03:20:43.303]  I remember at the time it came out that experts believed that there was no reason for Russia to kill this guy, that it was done to embarrass Russia.
[03:20:43.603 --> 03:20:44.664]  This is crazy!
[03:20:45.525 --> 03:20:52.130]  Well, look, it occurs to me that the people who created that document
[03:20:53.160 --> 03:20:54.361]  Should be ashamed of themselves.
[03:20:54.401 --> 03:20:56.202]  Look at that guy, he thinks he's so frickin' smart.
[03:20:56.322 --> 03:21:01.086]  Well, if 007 thinks he's so damn smart and wants to be taken seriously, he might learn how to spell.
[03:21:02.047 --> 03:21:05.869]  Their dossier is rife with misspellings.
[03:21:05.889 --> 03:21:08.251]  It was not even, it wasn't even good for ass wiping.
[03:21:08.792 --> 03:21:20.860]  So, the idea that, that James Clapper, uh, and the boys down at Langley would include this, uh, in a report to President Obama and President Trump, this is a vile
[03:21:21.820 --> 03:21:33.044]  By the way, I'm told by three sources, low-level, mid-level, and high-level in the CIA, that the whole agency hates the globalists, wants America to be great, they hate Hillary, they hate it all.
[03:21:33.104 --> 03:21:38.846]  They say, and I was told this weeks ago, this is all farmed out to subgroups, PR firms, as later came out.
[03:21:39.146 --> 03:21:40.346]  I forgot how accurate their info was.
[03:21:40.566 --> 03:21:41.346]  It's all completely fake.
[03:21:41.506 --> 03:21:42.667]  So it isn't even the CIA.
[03:21:43.347 --> 03:21:44.447]  The CIA doesn't like this.
[03:21:44.687 --> 03:21:46.648]  I think that's why the globalists are in so much trouble.
[03:21:46.888 --> 03:21:48.709]  Their own agencies have turned against them.
[03:21:49.429 --> 03:21:59.714]  Well, and it would be outrageously unfair to say that everybody who works for the Central Intelligence Agency is in league with the globalist agenda.
[03:21:59.774 --> 03:22:08.838]  No, there are patriotic Americans that work there, just as there are many, many, many non-political patriotic Americans who work for the FBI.
[03:22:09.439 --> 03:22:12.580]  But the leadership of these agencies are rotten to the core.
[03:22:12.920 --> 03:22:13.961]  They are corrupt.
[03:22:14.221 --> 03:22:16.222]  And by the way, let's elaborate on this.
[03:22:16.242 --> 03:22:18.103]  I don't know how much you can tell, the back story.
[03:22:20.664 --> 03:22:25.586]  Well, I mean, obviously, can we discuss whether the President knows about this?
[03:22:25.806 --> 03:22:26.766]  President-elect?
[03:22:26.966 --> 03:22:30.988]  I have not discussed this with the President-elect, and I'm not going to burden him with it.
[03:22:31.048 --> 03:22:31.988]  I know, you told me that a week ago.
[03:22:32.008 --> 03:22:32.788]  I said you've got to tell him.
[03:22:33.329 --> 03:22:39.091]  Look, if one of his good friends is being poisoned, he goes to your wedding and stuff, you've been friends for 41 years, you might want to tell him.
[03:22:39.491 --> 03:22:55.205]  Well, I'm sure someone will tell him, but frankly, I'm not going to bother the President-elect at a time that he is thinking about the Supreme Court, where he is duking it out with the intelligence agencies who are determined to take him down.
[03:22:55.226 --> 03:22:59.389]  You know, this is not really about me.
[03:22:59.489 --> 03:23:03.573]  I'm glad to be alive, but this is about the anti-globalist revolution.
[03:23:03.593 --> 03:23:05.235]  But it does show they're taking the gloves off.
[03:23:05.635 --> 03:23:06.875]  Yeah, so what's going to happen?
[03:23:07.435 --> 03:23:22.579]  Some in the mainstream media and the assholes at Media Matters for America, and correct the record, money laundering fronts, professional liars and propagandists are going to make light of this and say it's a joke.
[03:23:23.099 --> 03:23:25.879]  If you were as sick as I was, you would know it's a joke.
[03:23:25.899 --> 03:23:27.580]  Well, sir, you also got visited by the feds.
[03:23:27.620 --> 03:23:28.280]  Can you get into that?
[03:23:28.760 --> 03:23:32.483]  Well, I have let the government know what I know.
[03:23:33.644 --> 03:23:36.666]  And, you know, there's a series of intelligent questions here.
[03:23:37.507 --> 03:23:43.972]  Did I eat or drink with any foreign nationals or strangers in the days and weeks before I was sick?
[03:23:44.532 --> 03:23:46.334]  I couldn't connect the dots on that.
[03:23:46.874 --> 03:23:50.297]  I don't know how I may have ingested poison.
[03:23:52.159 --> 03:23:56.102]  I'm thankful that I didn't ingest enough to kill me.
[03:23:56.862 --> 03:24:01.586]  I had fevers that were problematic for 15 days.
[03:24:02.366 --> 03:24:06.409]  This is not a great experience and I don't recommend it for weight loss.
[03:24:06.929 --> 03:24:09.972]  But as you can see, my collars are large on me.
[03:24:10.272 --> 03:24:13.434]  I lost, I don't know, 7 pounds.
[03:24:14.415 --> 03:24:16.556]  This was not a great experience.
[03:24:17.837 --> 03:24:25.443]  I am committed to busting the lies about the Russian hacking.
[03:24:25.943 --> 03:24:29.986]  My book does that with an enormous amount of new information.
[03:24:30.026 --> 03:24:30.427]  Exactly.
[03:24:30.467 --> 03:24:33.809]  Oh, and by the way, Weldon came in here during the break and corrected me.
[03:24:34.169 --> 03:24:38.453]  They are now announcing pre-sales because they weren't going to allow it until the day of.
[03:24:39.153 --> 03:24:41.015]  Uh, which I guess is the 31st, if it's still that.
[03:24:41.315 --> 03:24:44.779]  We can now say pre-orders for your new book are available.
[03:24:44.799 --> 03:24:47.161]  The book is being printed as we speak.
[03:24:47.261 --> 03:24:50.124]  Let's talk about your book some, because, you know, it's important to get out.
[03:24:50.164 --> 03:24:51.845]  It's got a blueprint for victory in the future.
[03:24:52.206 --> 03:24:53.247]  It breaks down everything.
[03:24:53.347 --> 03:24:54.248]  Everyone needs to get your book.
[03:24:55.319 --> 03:25:00.903]  This is a book about how Donald Trump pulled off the greatest political upset in American history.
[03:25:01.764 --> 03:25:14.552]  This is a book about courage and balls and the tipping point that has finally been reached where the putrid, lying, alleged media like CNN
[03:25:15.453 --> 03:25:23.720]  The very people who let Ted Cruz attack me viciously and then would not afford me the opportunity to respond.
[03:25:24.201 --> 03:25:26.983]  Not once, not twice, but three times.
[03:25:27.764 --> 03:25:31.127]  All I'm asking for, Alex, elementary fairness.
[03:25:32.099 --> 03:25:44.544]  When Ted Cruz falsely accused me of smearing him, the folks at CBS, to their credit, called, sent out a crew, taped a response, and played both of them.
[03:25:44.805 --> 03:25:46.966]  His attack on me and my response.
[03:25:47.606 --> 03:25:49.807]  That's what real reporters do.
[03:25:50.727 --> 03:25:52.328]  CNN allowed
[03:25:54.033 --> 03:26:12.506]  John Podesta, both on the airplane, on video, and after the election, to repeat again the lie that I knew about his hacking, that I knew about Russians feeding Julian Assange, a lie, I know no such thing.
[03:26:13.487 --> 03:26:23.015]  Yet CNN never afforded me, despite my requests, an opportunity to respond in the same day part.
[03:26:23.695 --> 03:26:37.106]  So if Anderson Cooper, who I confess to thinking is quite well-dressed and has been on my international best-dressed list in the past that I put out every New Year's,
[03:26:38.627 --> 03:26:42.090]  If he had any journalistic integrity, he was given the opportunity to respond.
[03:26:42.110 --> 03:26:42.651]  He's not a journalist.
[03:26:42.671 --> 03:26:45.133]  He's a leftist Ford Foundation CIA operative.
[03:26:45.794 --> 03:26:47.716]  Well, and CNN is busted.
[03:26:48.417 --> 03:26:50.238]  And they are going to continue to be busted.
[03:26:50.278 --> 03:26:52.320]  Let's expand on that, and then I'm going to let you take over.
[03:26:52.360 --> 03:26:53.922]  But this is riveting, and I don't want to leave.
[03:26:53.942 --> 03:26:55.383]  I'm going to be watching after I'm off.
[03:26:56.144 --> 03:26:56.685]  Seriously.
[03:26:56.705 --> 03:26:56.805]  Roger.
[03:26:58.286 --> 03:27:01.807]  I love Trump saying, we're going to expand the press corps into basically an arena.
[03:27:02.028 --> 03:27:04.248]  We're going to let the real new independent media in.
[03:27:04.549 --> 03:27:06.429]  The mainstream's crapping themselves.
[03:27:06.830 --> 03:27:07.650]  They're imploding.
[03:27:07.710 --> 03:27:09.511]  CNN's about to be sold off, they admit.
[03:27:09.831 --> 03:27:10.911]  It's a shadow of itself.
[03:27:11.771 --> 03:27:14.353]  And there's Trump going, no, you don't get time to respond.
[03:27:14.633 --> 03:27:15.433]  You're fake news.
[03:27:15.473 --> 03:27:16.734]  You don't give me time to respond.
[03:27:17.094 --> 03:27:18.354]  He's finally calling them out.
[03:27:18.394 --> 03:27:20.135]  I mean, this is the beginning of the end of these people.
[03:27:21.129 --> 03:27:26.532]  Alex, I must tell you, I have read extensively about the AT&T-Time Warner merger.
[03:27:27.973 --> 03:27:31.855]  I actually think it's not necessarily a bad deal, and I don't think it violates the law.
[03:27:32.575 --> 03:27:38.838]  But I wouldn't approve it unless Time Warner spun off CNN.
[03:27:39.399 --> 03:27:41.120]  Perhaps RT would like to buy it.
[03:27:41.160 --> 03:27:44.281]  Maybe Putin will pick it up for a song.
[03:27:44.902 --> 03:27:45.822]  Nobody's watching.
[03:27:46.523 --> 03:27:48.544]  Their viewers are dwindling.
[03:27:49.384 --> 03:27:54.987]  The hysteria of last night, watching Don Lemon.
[03:27:55.547 --> 03:27:56.908]  Don, what's with that knot?
[03:27:57.008 --> 03:27:59.429]  That's the fattest knot I've ever seen.
[03:27:59.809 --> 03:28:00.129]  Awful.
[03:28:00.429 --> 03:28:00.710]  Awful.
[03:28:01.450 --> 03:28:04.231]  You'll never make the best dressed list with that.
[03:28:06.092 --> 03:28:07.433]  Near hysterical.
[03:28:08.894 --> 03:28:13.636]  A fellow from the minority coalitions for Trump did an excellent job of punching back.
[03:28:13.736 --> 03:28:14.236]  Sorry.
[03:28:14.977 --> 03:28:17.458]  Martin Luther King III met yesterday with Trump.
[03:28:18.596 --> 03:28:22.678]  Dr. King's niece announced that she voted for Trump.
[03:28:23.098 --> 03:28:26.560]  You're not keeping black people on the plantation anymore!
[03:28:26.580 --> 03:28:27.800]  And that's why they're panicking.
[03:28:27.840 --> 03:28:33.883]  What do you make, and then I'm gonna let you go to the show, of John Lewis coming out attacking Trump.
[03:28:33.963 --> 03:28:37.925]  Trump nicely responds and they say it's because he's racist.
[03:28:37.945 --> 03:28:40.146]  I mean there's a death of logic here.
[03:28:40.966 --> 03:28:44.148]  Well Alex, this is I think a very key point.
[03:28:45.508 --> 03:28:46.409]  Congressman Lewis
[03:28:47.611 --> 03:28:51.275]  ...was an honest-to-God hero on the Edmund Pettus Bridge.
[03:28:51.876 --> 03:28:55.940]  Yes, he shed blood for the Civil Rights Movement.
[03:28:56.761 --> 03:28:58.162]  Nothing pisses me off!
[03:28:58.962 --> 03:29:05.888]  More than when David Brock and the weenies who work for them say, I am a racist.
[03:29:06.628 --> 03:29:09.150]  I am a Nixon Republican.
[03:29:09.851 --> 03:29:16.056]  Richard Nixon marshaled the votes to pass the 1958 Civil Rights Act.
[03:29:16.416 --> 03:29:18.178]  The Democrats didn't have the numbers.
[03:29:18.798 --> 03:29:25.323]  Richard Nixon brought us black capitalism, desegregated the public schools.
[03:29:26.364 --> 03:29:31.328]  I was marching for Rockefeller drug law reform in New York.
[03:29:31.548 --> 03:29:33.929]  Racist drug laws, targeted!
[03:29:34.310 --> 03:29:35.350]  I'm gonna let you take over.
[03:29:35.390 --> 03:29:36.271]  Great job, my friend.
[03:29:36.291 --> 03:29:36.831]  You're a hero.
[03:29:36.911 --> 03:29:38.272]  Roger Stone, come back to that.
[03:29:38.613 --> 03:29:40.354]  Another side, I'm handing the baton to Roger Stone.
[03:29:40.374 --> 03:29:41.495]  And we're off to D.C.
[03:29:41.515 --> 03:29:41.955]  tomorrow.
[03:29:42.475 --> 03:29:43.176]  This is incredible.
[03:29:43.196 --> 03:29:43.476]  It's great.
[03:29:43.536 --> 03:29:44.356]  It's good to be back, folks.
[03:29:44.437 --> 03:29:44.737]  Love you.
[03:29:45.157 --> 03:29:45.817]  Great job, the crew.
[03:29:46.038 --> 03:29:46.838]  Roger Stone, coming up.
[03:29:46.878 --> 03:29:47.779]  InfoWars.com.
[03:29:48.439 --> 03:29:49.340]  We're on the march.
[03:29:49.840 --> 03:29:51.441]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.382 --> 03:29:55.044]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:59.571 --> 03:30:05.746]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[03:30:06.308 --> 03:30:07.711]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[03:30:08.598 --> 03:30:10.479]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[03:30:11.100 --> 03:30:16.664]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[03:30:17.245 --> 03:30:25.231]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[03:30:25.251 --> 03:30:27.713]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[03:30:27.993 --> 03:30:32.236]  This is the best system out there, and we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[03:30:32.476 --> 03:30:33.217]  This is how it works.
[03:30:33.537 --> 03:30:34.038]  You order.
[03:30:34.158 --> 03:30:34.958]  Customized or
[03:30:36.039 --> 03:30:45.501]  Straight from the factory, however you want it, it is shipped on the next business day to you and your family, and a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this Republic.
[03:30:45.721 --> 03:30:46.481]  You cannot lose.
[03:30:46.521 --> 03:30:47.621]  You're funding the Infowar.
[03:30:47.921 --> 03:30:54.663]  You're getting the highest quality product, the most tested, the most durable, the most certified, the most believed in.
[03:30:55.003 --> 03:30:58.963]  You need to have this true piece of America ready in minutes.
[03:30:59.884 --> 03:31:01.524]  I'm gonna lay it out short and sweet.
[03:31:03.348 --> 03:31:09.009]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[03:31:09.730 --> 03:31:13.711]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[03:31:14.571 --> 03:31:16.791]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[03:31:16.891 --> 03:31:18.032]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[03:31:18.052 --> 03:31:21.272]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[03:31:22.253 --> 03:31:22.573]  Or more.
[03:31:22.673 --> 03:31:24.633]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[03:31:25.113 --> 03:31:26.594]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[03:31:26.714 --> 03:31:30.054]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[03:31:30.154 --> 03:31:31.915]  It's actually scary.
[03:31:32.817 --> 03:31:42.886]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[03:31:43.887 --> 03:31:56.697]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support InfoWars in our fight to promote human liberty and freedom.
[03:32:03.612 --> 03:32:05.133]  There is a crisis in America today.
[03:32:05.594 --> 03:32:07.995]  Tens of millions of us are addicted to cell phones.
[03:32:08.316 --> 03:32:15.721]  These little devices, according to many university studies and more, cause health risks such as depression, cancer, and social anxiety.
[03:32:16.122 --> 03:32:19.704]  How can we prevent these harmful devices from harming us and our families?
[03:32:19.725 --> 03:32:21.206]  I have the answer for you today.
[03:32:21.626 --> 03:32:22.767]  It's called the Blocking Pocket.
[03:32:23.530 --> 03:32:28.834]  The Block It Pocket works by securing your phone in its safe, no radiation compartment.
[03:32:29.254 --> 03:32:35.038]  I use the Block It Pocket every day to protect me from harmful radiation and prevent others from stealing my stuff.
[03:32:35.859 --> 03:32:38.320]  Online, your entire persona is visible.
[03:32:38.520 --> 03:32:44.464]  Your credit card numbers, your email, everything about you that a criminal can use to hack and buy things under your name.
[03:32:45.265 --> 03:32:46.888]  With a Block-It Pocket, this is impossible.
[03:32:47.389 --> 03:32:50.053]  It blocks those harmful signals so that you can be safe.
[03:32:50.394 --> 03:32:54.962]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today and make sure to secure your very own Block-It Pocket.
[03:33:01.084 --> 03:33:10.227]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[03:33:28.812 --> 03:33:32.815]  It's good to be here.
[03:33:58.465 --> 03:33:58.845]  All right.
[03:34:00.927 --> 03:34:02.688]  Welcome back to InfoWars.
[03:34:03.469 --> 03:34:12.055]  I have just taken the baton from the great Alex Jones, looking robust and healthy after his brief vacation.
[03:34:13.556 --> 03:34:18.059]  I am delighted to pick up the theme where we left off.
[03:34:19.632 --> 03:34:35.162]  This constant attack that we are racists, that Trump is a racist, is aggravating in view of the fact that, in fact, I have done, I have had a career of supporting both civil rights and racial justice.
[03:34:36.362 --> 03:34:43.567]  The black voters, African-American voters in this country have been used by the Democrats and you can see our inner cities.
[03:34:44.127 --> 03:34:45.868]  Trump is trying to reach out.
[03:34:46.048 --> 03:34:47.049]  Now, John Lewis,
[03:34:48.066 --> 03:35:03.776]  Mr. Lewis specifically said he was boycotting the inaugural because Trump's election was illegitimate, because the Russians hacked the election and tipped it in Trump's favor.
[03:35:04.457 --> 03:35:08.479]  Not even the whack jobs at the CIA claim that.
[03:35:09.260 --> 03:35:15.364]  They don't claim that whatever they say the Russians did changed the outcome of the election.
[03:35:16.249 --> 03:35:35.356]  Now, Representative Lewis is a genuine hero, and he shed blood on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, but either he must produce the proof that the Russians changed the outcome of the election, and therefore Trump's election isn't legitimate, or he needs to shut up.
[03:35:36.328 --> 03:35:51.235]  He also lied when he said that he's never done this before, because he thought George W. Bush's election was illegitimate, and he refused to attend that inaugural.
[03:35:52.205 --> 03:36:08.794]  So, in all fairness, Representative Lewis negates his bravery in the civil rights struggle when he acts like a partisan hack, when he says things that are not true, that are lies, and he should apologize.
[03:36:09.634 --> 03:36:10.615]  He picked this fight.
[03:36:11.235 --> 03:36:12.737]  Trump did not pick this fight.
[03:36:13.277 --> 03:36:19.382]  You can go on Donald Trump's Twitter feed today, and he correctly calls Lewis out.
[03:36:19.703 --> 03:36:24.547]  No, you did this same media stunt to George W. Bush.
[03:36:25.067 --> 03:36:27.389]  This is partisan hackery.
[03:36:28.330 --> 03:36:30.952]  He owes the President-elect an apology.
[03:36:31.332 --> 03:36:37.718]  Or, or, produce the evidence the Russians changed the outcome of this election.
[03:36:39.531 --> 03:36:41.873]  Alex made reference to Deplorable.
[03:36:42.834 --> 03:36:48.178]  This is the event, January 19th, at the National Press Club.
[03:36:48.919 --> 03:36:57.847]  Alex Jones is speaking, Mike Cernovich, Jack Posobiak, and other patriots, other fighters for liberty.
[03:36:58.547 --> 03:37:00.429]  This is the grassroots event, folks.
[03:37:01.250 --> 03:37:05.033]  The millionaires and the billionaires and the elites
[03:37:06.820 --> 03:37:11.022]  Who did not support Donald Trump, but are now posing as his friends.
[03:37:12.303 --> 03:37:19.947]  And those who did legitimately help the president in official roles, they'll be at the official events.
[03:37:20.507 --> 03:37:22.568]  I will be at some of the official events.
[03:37:23.249 --> 03:37:25.670]  I'm excited about the swearing in.
[03:37:26.631 --> 03:37:34.675]  After all, how many times in life do you get an opportunity to wear a top hat and not look like a dork?
[03:37:36.004 --> 03:37:38.767]  Although I did wear one when I was married.
[03:37:39.407 --> 03:37:42.810]  So, I'm very excited about this, but Alex is right.
[03:37:43.491 --> 03:37:50.737]  There are now radical groups threatening to fill baggies with urine, with Clorox, to throw them on people.
[03:37:51.298 --> 03:38:01.867]  There are people, there are radical groups openly saying they're going to harass attendees, they're going to harass those who try to attend.
[03:38:02.728 --> 03:38:04.969]  I do think Washington is a tinderbox.
[03:38:05.749 --> 03:38:16.452]  I do think there are those on the radical left, DJ 20, other radical groups who are going to try to be inciting violence.
[03:38:17.432 --> 03:38:31.476]  And that's why I noticed that the tactical nanotechnology body armor at the InfoWars store is now available, and I think that
[03:38:32.403 --> 03:38:34.484]  You ought to consider getting some of this.
[03:38:34.544 --> 03:38:40.166]  This is the best high-end, totally tested body armor out there.
[03:38:41.486 --> 03:38:52.790]  Former Blackwater operators, former Army Rangers, who Info Wars did to conduct testing and a survey to bring you the very best products, swear by this armor.
[03:38:53.990 --> 03:38:55.512]  It's only a quarter of an inch thick.
[03:38:55.532 --> 03:38:56.533]  This is not bulky.
[03:38:56.953 --> 03:39:03.380]  It's field tested, but it can stop a 50 AA pistol cartridge.
[03:39:03.780 --> 03:39:05.142]  That's how tough this stuff is.
[03:39:05.562 --> 03:39:07.644]  So this price is phenomenal.
[03:39:08.805 --> 03:39:15.812]  And whether you're a hunter, whether you're a sportsman, whether you're headed to Washington, I really recommend this product.
[03:39:17.304 --> 03:39:27.493]  I know that I will be mocked and attacked by the Clinton thugs and lackeys because I swear by the products on the Infowars.com website.
[03:39:28.714 --> 03:39:34.439]  I don't know that I would be alive today without the liver defense and the flush of my system.
[03:39:35.220 --> 03:39:40.024]  And I'm not going to go through this again, but these products work, folks.
[03:39:42.500 --> 03:39:43.722]  It's a win-win.
[03:39:44.263 --> 03:39:45.927]  You are helping the revolution.
[03:39:46.407 --> 03:39:48.732]  You're helping broadcast the truth.
[03:39:49.313 --> 03:39:53.521]  You're helping bust through the mainstream media blackouts.
[03:39:54.978 --> 03:39:59.522]  And you are helping fund the revolution.
[03:40:00.183 --> 03:40:06.629]  So go to the Infowars store now and pick up your body armor or any of these other fine supplements.
[03:40:07.110 --> 03:40:09.312]  You've got some great discount prices right now.
[03:40:10.213 --> 03:40:14.376]  I stocked up before Christmas, thank God I did, because I didn't want to wait.
[03:40:15.337 --> 03:40:16.358]  So go to the store.
[03:40:18.117 --> 03:40:24.361]  While I'm very excited about January 20th, I'm also very excited about January 23rd.
[03:40:25.202 --> 03:40:32.726]  That's when CNN talking head Anna Navarro speaks at the Broward Community College in Fort Lauderdale.
[03:40:33.747 --> 03:40:41.172]  Now, Navarro is a harpy Republican who said on CNN she voted for Hillary Clinton.
[03:40:41.994 --> 03:40:51.386]  Who can forget her memorable on-air meltdown when she was screaming, PUSSY, PUSSY, PUSSY, PUSSY at the top of her lungs?
[03:40:51.947 --> 03:40:55.432]  CNN has taken that offline.
[03:40:55.832 --> 03:40:56.233]  You can't find it.
[03:41:01.018 --> 03:41:12.423]  Who is Jeb Bush Lackey, was actually fired by Bush, actually initially hired to go into the council's office to handle immigration policy.
[03:41:13.103 --> 03:41:14.404]  There was one small problem.
[03:41:15.244 --> 03:41:17.926]  She lied about being a member of the Florida Bar.
[03:41:18.606 --> 03:41:21.407]  She is not an attorney in the state of Florida.
[03:41:22.007 --> 03:41:24.709]  She also has no campaign experience.
[03:41:25.229 --> 03:41:29.451]  She has never been a part of a successful Republican campaign for anything.
[03:41:30.430 --> 03:41:37.996]  So why would CNN, that promulgates fake news, want to employ someone like this?
[03:41:38.857 --> 03:41:43.740]  And her shrill personal attacks on Donald Trump grow tedious.
[03:41:44.581 --> 03:41:47.463]  It is time for her to be confronted with her own record of lies.
[03:41:48.024 --> 03:41:52.087]  So, join me for Anna Navarro's terrific speech.
[03:41:52.567 --> 03:41:54.389]  I'm sure it will be insightful.
[03:41:55.345 --> 03:42:03.008]  I don't know what the Broward Community College is paying this pathetic toady, but I do know this.
[03:42:04.469 --> 03:42:15.394]  At CNN, the makeup people, the hairdressers, the doormen, the gaffers, the cameramen, the little people,
[03:42:16.547 --> 03:42:24.614]  They tell me she's an abusive diva, that she yells at them, she abuses them, she is mean to them, because she thinks she's something.
[03:42:25.155 --> 03:42:27.737]  But folks, she's dumber than dog crap.
[03:42:29.118 --> 03:42:30.139]  And it has to be said.
[03:42:30.860 --> 03:42:42.370]  And that CNN would have someone as a talking head, who has lied about their background like this, shows that they are committed to fake news.
[03:42:45.538 --> 03:42:50.060]  President Donald Trump thinking seriously about the Supreme Court.
[03:42:51.180 --> 03:42:57.622]  Now, I am among those who believes he may have as many as four appointments.
[03:42:59.283 --> 03:43:06.565]  And I think that he has an opportunity to transform the court.
[03:43:07.366 --> 03:43:07.806]  See, I think
[03:43:09.233 --> 03:43:16.936]  I think Trump is a transformational president, not a transitional president, a transformational president.
[03:43:17.457 --> 03:43:24.560]  And I think he can bring wholesale change to our system and reinvigorate this country and get it back on its feet.
[03:43:25.900 --> 03:43:29.622]  And the political establishment will fight this tooth and nail.
[03:43:31.082 --> 03:43:33.584]  And one of the forums in which they will fight it is the U.S.
[03:43:33.604 --> 03:43:34.284]  Supreme Court.
[03:43:35.184 --> 03:43:36.445]  Now, many of you know
[03:43:37.389 --> 03:43:45.242]  That President Trump, President Elect Trump released a list during the general election and said he would choose from that list.
[03:43:46.504 --> 03:43:50.772]  And it's true that everybody on that list is a solid conservative.
[03:43:51.823 --> 03:44:09.240]  Frankly, I wish the list had included my friend Judge Andrew Napolitano of Fox News, a trial judge in New Jersey, a learned judge, a true student of the Constitution, a man who was a protege and close friend of Antonin Scalia.
[03:44:10.148 --> 03:44:12.589]  Who, yes, I believe was murdered.
[03:44:13.129 --> 03:44:16.891]  I will publish an extensive piece on that in February.
[03:44:17.872 --> 03:44:24.175]  I wish the list had included Judge Janice Rogers Brown, an African-American conservative in the D.C.
[03:44:24.235 --> 03:44:27.917]  circuit, not afraid to put administrative agencies in their place.
[03:44:28.837 --> 03:44:31.939]  I wish the list had included Judge Alex Kaczynski.
[03:44:32.879 --> 03:44:41.475]  A Jewish, Eastern European, a serious constitutional scholar on the appeals court of the Ninth Circuit.
[03:44:42.697 --> 03:44:47.818]  Very much like Justice Scalia in temperament and wit.
[03:44:48.638 --> 03:44:54.719]  I wish the list had included Judge Reggie Walton, an African-American on the U.S.
[03:44:54.900 --> 03:45:06.702]  District Court who has ruled, who's a former head of the FISA Court, a national security hawk, a man who is sometimes skeptical of the government's claims.
[03:45:08.202 --> 03:45:11.043]  Although I was critical of him during the campaign,
[03:45:11.963 --> 03:45:21.277]  Senator Mike Lee of Utah, a serious constitutional scholar, a conservative libertarian, someone I would like to have seen on the list.
[03:45:22.673 --> 03:45:28.295]  And lastly, former Judge Michael Luttig, formerly of the U.S.
[03:45:28.335 --> 03:45:38.279]  Court of Appeals, now General Counsel of Boeing, a brilliant law clerk for Justice Scalia, resigned from the bench.
[03:45:39.359 --> 03:45:45.501]  I would have liked to see all of these libertarian conservatives on the list.
[03:45:47.242 --> 03:45:49.963]  I understand, though, that President Trump may feel
[03:45:50.831 --> 03:46:00.038]  That's to keep faith with the American people, that he should select for this appointment from the list he made public.
[03:46:00.758 --> 03:46:19.452]  Therefore, I am hoping that he appoints Judge Don Willetts of the Texas courts, a feisty libertarian who is on the list, a fine jurist with guts, not a right-wing jurist, a conservative,
[03:46:20.438 --> 03:46:22.219]  But a libertarian conservative.
[03:46:23.060 --> 03:46:25.842]  One who will back the Trump revolution.
[03:46:26.723 --> 03:46:28.904]  I don't want a right-wing court.
[03:46:29.705 --> 03:46:31.726]  I want a Trump court.
[03:46:32.387 --> 03:46:34.668]  I want a reform court.
[03:46:35.489 --> 03:46:38.451]  I want an anti-establishment court.
[03:46:39.652 --> 03:46:42.034]  And that is my fondest hope.
[03:46:44.876 --> 03:46:48.579]  I also have noticed this past week
[03:46:49.488 --> 03:46:55.815]  The public comments of Senator Jeff Sessions as he cruises to confirmation as Attorney General.
[03:46:57.056 --> 03:47:00.039]  Now, I am a Jeff Sessions fan.
[03:47:00.820 --> 03:47:02.782]  I like Jeff Sessions on law and order.
[03:47:03.362 --> 03:47:05.424]  I like Jeff Sessions on immigration.
[03:47:06.145 --> 03:47:08.327]  I like Jeff Sessions because he's got guts.
[03:47:09.258 --> 03:47:12.981]  I like Jeff Sessions because he's not part of the crowd in the U.S.
[03:47:13.021 --> 03:47:19.867]  Senate, where he is extremely well-liked and respected, but he's not a go-along-to-get-along guy, and he never will be.
[03:47:20.888 --> 03:47:30.997]  I was, however, distressed by his comments regarding the 37 states that have some form of legal marijuana.
[03:47:32.901 --> 03:47:35.365]  Currently, the U.S.
[03:47:35.405 --> 03:47:44.538]  government is in a stand-down position where they are not enforcing federal law where it contradicts state law.
[03:47:45.899 --> 03:47:50.803]  I can argue legally that the states have supremacy in this area.
[03:47:51.504 --> 03:47:54.106]  Other federal advocates will claim no.
[03:47:54.626 --> 03:47:55.266]  The feds do.
[03:47:55.347 --> 03:48:05.555]  Joining me now is attorney Tyler Nixon, who is a nephew of former, I guess great-nephew of former President
[03:48:06.303 --> 03:48:07.104]  Richard Nixon.
[03:48:07.724 --> 03:48:10.145]  Their families hail from Ohio.
[03:48:11.086 --> 03:48:14.668]  He is a libertarian attorney of some note.
[03:48:15.548 --> 03:48:26.055]  He is a former Delaware activist who is now representing numerous clients in the legal marijuana business.
[03:48:26.995 --> 03:48:29.937]  Tyler, thanks for joining me here at InfoWars.
[03:48:31.017 --> 03:48:32.718]  Roger, it's great to be with you as always.
[03:48:33.039 --> 03:48:35.340]  You have excellent taste in judges, I must say.
[03:48:35.871 --> 03:48:39.653]  There's one name I'd throw in, and I don't know why it's never come up, is Richard Epstein.
[03:48:40.254 --> 03:48:47.498]  He's a brilliant legal mind and author who would make an excellent, he's what I would call a libertarian constitutionalist.
[03:48:48.859 --> 03:48:53.842]  Well, I understand the importance of the list.
[03:48:54.588 --> 03:49:00.552]  And I can understand if President-elect Trump feels he must stick to the list for his first appointment.
[03:49:01.452 --> 03:49:06.495]  And I know because of my many friendships in the campaign, the list was put together quickly.
[03:49:06.515 --> 03:49:08.476]  And there's many fine people on it.
[03:49:08.896 --> 03:49:10.978]  I don't mean to take anything away from them, but...
[03:49:11.718 --> 03:49:15.840]  I believe that most of them are more establishment-oriented conservatives.
[03:49:16.481 --> 03:49:19.022]  To me, Judge Napolitano would be a brilliant pick.
[03:49:20.403 --> 03:49:31.529]  If it cannot be him, and I think he makes sense for a number of reasons, then I hope they go to Judge Willett, who is the outstanding libertarian on this list.
[03:49:32.110 --> 03:49:39.694]  But why don't you sum up for us, Jeff Sessions, on marijuana, what he said this week, and how you see this playing out?
[03:49:41.175 --> 03:49:54.419]  Well, obviously there's a lot of trepidation in the industry, which is now employing tens, if not hundreds, into the hundreds of thousands of Americans who are gainfully employed, feeding their families.
[03:49:55.179 --> 03:50:06.323]  There's a lot of investment going on, just an amazing innovation, I have to say, not just within the actual production of cannabis and different products, but also just
[03:50:07.447 --> 03:50:07.988]  I think so.
[03:50:24.610 --> 03:50:39.402]  What anybody wants to hear who takes the libertarian view of this, but also the rational, logical, fact-based view of cannabis as a product for any type of consumption, which is that it is effectively harmless.
[03:50:39.762 --> 03:50:47.608]  There's been no deaths associated with it, and it's a 5,000-year known history of use by humankind.
[03:50:49.258 --> 03:50:56.481]  You know, Senator Sessions is probably what is considered one of the worst possible picks from the perspective of the cannabis industry.
[03:50:56.841 --> 03:50:57.041]  Wow.
[03:50:57.301 --> 03:50:57.882]  Tyler Lutt.
[03:50:57.922 --> 03:50:58.402]  Tyler Lutt.
[03:50:58.542 --> 03:50:58.942]  Tyler Lutt.
[03:50:59.402 --> 03:51:02.384]  Nobody loves Barack Obama more than Barack Obama.
[03:51:02.504 --> 03:51:07.946]  In his speech during the Chicago Cubs World Series visit to the White House, he referred to himself a humble 40 times.
[03:51:08.146 --> 03:51:11.568]  In his farewell address, one of his many farewells, he referred to himself 75 times.
[03:51:12.728 --> 03:51:17.792]  When campaigning for Hillary Clinton in Philadelphia last year, he referred to himself 137 times.
[03:51:18.032 --> 03:51:25.557]  After the police shooting in Dallas, Obama delivered an address in which he referred to himself 45 times, not once referencing himself as one to blame.
[03:51:25.797 --> 03:51:30.160]  After a mass shooting in Oregon, in a 12-minute speech, he referenced himself 28 times.
[03:51:30.360 --> 03:51:34.984]  At the Democratic National Convention, Obama referred to himself a whopping 119 times.
[03:51:35.144 --> 03:51:37.425]  Some attendees were confused and thought he was running again.
[03:51:37.625 --> 03:51:40.107]  When speaking in India last year, he referred to himself 118 times.
[03:51:41.508 --> 03:51:42.889]  It's an international love fest.
[03:51:43.109 --> 03:51:48.230]  In a speech on jobs in Ohio in 2010, Barack referenced himself 132 times.
[03:51:48.590 --> 03:51:52.912]  But I want you to understand, this is not about me.
[03:51:53.132 --> 03:51:56.133]  And every morning he eats a bowl of Berrios to start his day.
[03:51:56.333 --> 03:51:58.434]  This is Owen Schroer for InfoWars.com.
[03:51:59.309 --> 03:52:07.432]  Our fellow info warriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[03:52:08.413 --> 03:52:17.216]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption and a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[03:52:17.616 --> 03:52:24.559]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme, and they've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[03:52:24.579 --> 03:52:26.080]  We now have George Soros
[03:52:27.180 --> 03:52:27.921]  As a goblin.
[03:52:28.601 --> 03:52:34.385]  On the back, and it says, with a cross through him, you know, an X, like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[03:52:35.126 --> 03:52:39.489]  It says, deport Soros on the bottom, and on the top it says, InfoWars established 1996.
[03:52:41.731 --> 03:52:48.836]  So, it is a limited edition, deport Soros on the back, Hillary for prison on the front, right-hand shoulder, InfoWars.com.
[03:52:49.176 --> 03:52:49.716]  It's powerful.
[03:52:49.736 --> 03:52:50.817]  I hope you get out to everybody you know.
[03:52:51.097 --> 03:52:52.859]  InfoWarsStore.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[03:52:59.315 --> 03:53:02.677]  If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse.
[03:53:02.897 --> 03:53:04.578]  Minor words and his was action.
[03:53:05.158 --> 03:53:06.699]  His was what he's done to women.
[03:53:06.739 --> 03:53:12.402]  There's never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that's been so abusive to women.
[03:53:12.642 --> 03:53:14.943]  Bill Clinton was abusive to women.
[03:53:15.304 --> 03:53:20.226]  Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously.
[03:53:20.306 --> 03:53:21.487]  Four of them here tonight.
[03:53:21.607 --> 03:53:26.910]  So much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses.
[03:53:37.762 --> 03:53:40.505]  There is an information warfare happening right now.
[03:53:41.366 --> 03:53:42.808]  It's a fight for our minds.
[03:53:43.489 --> 03:53:45.411]  And InfoWars.com is on the front lines.
[03:53:45.732 --> 03:53:49.957]  Download our free multimedia app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[03:53:50.077 --> 03:53:53.441]  It's free, it's on Droid, it's on Apple, you name it.
[03:53:53.521 --> 03:53:55.063]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[03:54:09.640 --> 03:54:12.525]  All right, welcome back to Info Wars.
[03:54:12.585 --> 03:54:16.932]  We're here with President Richard Nixon's great nephew, Attorney Tyler Nixon.
[03:54:17.372 --> 03:54:22.000]  We're running out of time, so Tyler, let's go back to where we were and kind of wrap this up.
[03:54:22.781 --> 03:54:23.021]  Sure.
[03:54:25.979 --> 03:54:29.624]  I was going to say congratulations on the new show.
[03:54:29.804 --> 03:54:30.545]  It's very exciting.
[03:54:30.625 --> 03:54:37.554]  InfoWars is a great platform, really the vanguard of the new media.
[03:54:37.995 --> 03:54:40.999]  I'm grateful to Alex Jones for affording me this time.
[03:54:42.020 --> 03:54:49.425]  Tyler, my concern here is that Senator Sessions doesn't seem to understand the medicinal value of marijuana.
[03:54:49.545 --> 03:54:53.187]  No, it's not that good people don't take marijuana, Senator.
[03:54:53.627 --> 03:54:54.688]  Sick people take it.
[03:54:54.708 --> 03:54:58.950]  And it has mutual, many, many medical benefits.
[03:54:59.551 --> 03:55:00.591]  The amounts of
[03:55:01.812 --> 03:55:10.234]  THC that had been tested by the federal government and their regimen are insufficient to prove this because Big Pharma doesn't want to prove it.
[03:55:10.674 --> 03:55:20.517]  They can't sell aspirin if people can take a legal substance grown in the earth and used as medicine for 2,000 years.
[03:55:20.537 --> 03:55:27.819]  37, pardon me, numerous enlightened states are now allowing this for medicinal purposes.
[03:55:28.803 --> 03:55:34.907]  And if this is not true, why does the federal government hold the patent on synthetic THC?
[03:55:35.587 --> 03:55:47.034]  What would be the value of this if it has no medicinal value, as our health bureaucracy in the federal government tells us over and over again?
[03:55:47.754 --> 03:55:50.797]  I thank you for your leadership in this community.
[03:55:51.217 --> 03:55:53.679]  Thank you for joining us today.
[03:55:54.079 --> 03:55:57.162]  Come back next week because I want to continue this discussion.
[03:55:57.562 --> 03:56:02.526]  Tyler Nixon, freedom fighter, someone who has been on the barricades.
[03:56:03.087 --> 03:56:03.767]  Thanks for joining us.
[03:56:03.787 --> 03:56:04.408]  Thank you, Roger.
[03:56:05.048 --> 03:56:05.468]  Thank you.
[03:56:07.650 --> 03:56:13.035]  This week, incredibly, NBC's lawyers say in federal court
[03:56:13.933 --> 03:56:25.255]  That the young man who wore a Clinton rape t-shirt on the Today Show should have expected to be beaten by NBC security guards.
[03:56:26.235 --> 03:56:28.556]  Folks, this is an outrage.
[03:56:29.036 --> 03:56:38.898]  He was beaten not by people in the audience, not by rabid Clinton supporters, but by NBC thugs.
[03:56:40.458 --> 03:56:43.423]  Now, these shirts are iconic.
[03:56:43.963 --> 03:56:49.572]  They're now hard to find because they were a device.
[03:56:50.535 --> 03:57:05.026]  That I dreamed up and Alex Jones propelled to break through the mainstream media blackout of Bill Clinton's history of serial rape and Hillary Clinton's role in covering it up.
[03:57:05.767 --> 03:57:08.569]  If you can find one of these, buy it now.
[03:57:09.149 --> 03:57:11.771]  This shirt's going to end up in the Smithsonian.
[03:57:12.665 --> 03:57:25.575]  And speaking of shirts, the Hillary Clinton for President 2017 shirt, now available at InfoWars.com, and just as important to me, the making of the President 2016.
[03:57:28.230 --> 03:57:36.775]  How Donald Trump orchestrated an American Revolution, now available for pre-order at the Infowars.com store.
[03:57:37.655 --> 03:57:51.083]  Also available at Amazon and Barnes & Noble, but buy it anywhere folks, but buy it if you want to know how Donald Trump pulled off the greatest upset in American history since Harry Truman beat
[03:57:52.418 --> 03:57:53.338]  Thomas E Dewey.
[03:57:54.059 --> 03:57:56.320]  Thanks for joining me here at InfoWars.
[03:57:56.880 --> 03:57:58.000]  I thank Alex Jones.
[03:57:58.060 --> 03:58:02.462]  I thank the great crew of folks at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:03.083 --> 03:58:04.123]  Go to the store, folks.
[03:58:04.523 --> 03:58:05.884]  Support the fight for liberty.
[03:58:06.304 --> 03:58:07.745]  And I'll see you soon.
[03:58:08.225 --> 03:58:08.745]  Many thanks.
[03:58:41.764 --> 03:58:45.745]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:58:49.086 --> 03:58:54.507]  With the inauguration around the corner, here's what we know about the fascists who are trying to obstruct Donald Trump's inauguration.
[03:58:54.647 --> 03:58:59.989]  Hundreds of thousands will be there to protest the inauguration of Trump, marching and chanting in the streets over fake news.
[03:59:00.109 --> 03:59:01.109]  But it has gotten darker.
[03:59:01.429 --> 03:59:04.830]  Advertisements to pay Trump protesters cropping up in dozens of U.S.
[03:59:04.850 --> 03:59:05.150]  cities.
[03:59:05.390 --> 03:59:07.832]  People like Rosie McDonald calling for martial law.
