[00:00:02.163 --> 00:00:04.364]  I've been everywhere, man.
[00:00:04.364 --> 00:00:06.164]  I've been everywhere, man.
[00:00:06.164 --> 00:00:08.445]  Across the deserts there, man.
[00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:10.325]  I breathe the mountain air, man.
[00:00:10.325 --> 00:00:12.886]  I travel like I had my share, man.
[00:00:12.886 --> 00:00:14.826]  I've been everywhere.
[00:00:14.826 --> 00:00:17.327]  The world is a dangerous place.
[00:00:17.327 --> 00:00:22.508]  Not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[00:00:22.508 --> 00:00:27.829]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:36.921]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we now know exactly why President Trump canned FBI Director Comey after he'd been on the job four years.
[00:00:46.564 --> 00:00:49.266]  The media is trying to act like Trump's all over the map waffling.
[00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:51.007]  Trump's been very clear.
[00:00:51.007 --> 00:01:04.256]  The guy thought he was his own power, thought he was above the law, wouldn't go after the Clintons for all the wiretapping, and Obama for all the wiretapping, and all the leaks, and was expanding the probe against the president when nothing had ever been found.
[00:01:05.285 --> 00:01:07.205]  But wouldn't even look at the Clintons.
[00:01:07.205 --> 00:01:14.387]  And we now learn, The Hill's reporting this on DrudgeReport.com, Comey called Trump crazy after Obama wiretapping claims report.
[00:01:14.387 --> 00:01:18.488]  But what came out in the Associated Press just last week?
[00:01:18.488 --> 00:01:28.090]  The admission that Obama ordered thousands of Americans surveilled during the election and they were using it for political purposes.
[00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.870]  That's in the WikiLeaks too.
[00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.010]  The whole thing was rigged.
[00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.971]  So he called him crazy.
[00:01:35.014 --> 00:01:39.277]  Yeah, crazy like a fox, all of that has now come out.
[00:01:39.277 --> 00:01:53.345]  Anybody can search in the term Obama ordered NSA to spy on thousands of Americans during the election.
[00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:55.746]  These are the true political crimes.
[00:01:55.746 --> 00:01:59.468]  Comey was expanding the Russian probe.
[00:01:59.468 --> 00:02:01.730]  Now, I have some sources close to the President.
[00:02:02.617 --> 00:02:05.558]  And we've talked to those sources yesterday and this morning.
[00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:15.000]  And we know who the next shoes to drop are going to be, and that's going to be Sean Spicer, the press secretary, reportedly is going to be axed in the next week.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.242]  You already have this huckabee lady who's the interim person.
[00:02:19.242 --> 00:02:22.683]  And then he's looking for a replacement of Rince Priebus right now.
[00:02:22.683 --> 00:02:26.524]  And Trump, for the first 70 days, did it the way he wanted Americana.
[00:02:26.524 --> 00:02:27.584]  Bannon was being listened to.
[00:02:29.454 --> 00:02:38.258]  And then Trump kind of didn't go sideways but tried to compromise some to get the system to just let him try to restore the Republic, cut taxes, and make America great again.
[00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:40.799]  And that only encouraged them to attack him more.
[00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.380]  So, Donald John Trump, folks, you want it?
[00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.660]  Get ready!
[00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.002]  Because you heard it here first, the gloves are off!
[00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:57.843]  He's going to go on a rampage against the un-American trash that have sold us out of the multinationals, the globalists, and more.
[00:02:57.843 --> 00:02:58.283]  And why not?
[00:02:58.283 --> 00:02:59.584]  They're on a rampage against us.
[00:02:59.584 --> 00:03:02.685]  Tim Allen has a hit show.
[00:03:02.685 --> 00:03:06.207]  But it got cancelled off ABC because he dared criticize
[00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.985]  The political Nazi control speech police.
[00:03:11.985 --> 00:03:22.439]  Roger Stone's coming up in the next segment with breaking news on multiple fronts, but here's a report from Mr. Pat Buchanan on the fact that Trump is right, Bannon is right, and it's time to take the gloves off.
[00:03:23.063 --> 00:03:28.945]  There's a cultural left and a political left and a media, if you will, a conglomerate.
[00:03:28.945 --> 00:03:36.167]  It's not a conspiracy, but it is collusion and they were determined to break and bring down Nixon from the day he was nominated.
[00:03:36.167 --> 00:03:39.229]  They determined, tried to break and bring, and they succeeded.
[00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:42.110]  Tried to break and bring down Reagan over Iran-Contra.
[00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.050]  I was in the White House then.
[00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.137]  And the same forces, similar forces, are trying to break and bring down Trump.
[00:03:48.137 --> 00:03:50.440]  And it's transparent, it's right in front of us.
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:57.811]  I mean, you can't watch those briefings and things and watch TV, cable TV and the rest of it, without seeing.
[00:03:57.811 --> 00:03:59.493]  This is a real, there's a real animus.
[00:04:00.134 --> 00:04:02.396]  I mean, it's the White House Correspondents' Dinner.
[00:04:02.396 --> 00:04:07.419]  Steve Bannon was dead right when he said one thing, the media are the opposition party.
[00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:17.287]  Well, you know, Nixon said, when I was an editorial writer, one of the youngest editorial writers on a major paper in America, you know, back in 1962, 3, 4, 5.
[00:04:17.287 --> 00:04:20.309]  But I'd go into the Columbia School of Journalism, so I didn't hate journalism.
[00:04:20.309 --> 00:04:22.991]  I was proud, you know, they regarded these guys at the Times as...
[00:04:23.531 --> 00:04:23.931]  We're good to go.
[00:04:43.576 --> 00:04:51.743]  And he said, you know, the press has inordinate power because it decides what people will talk about and think about, what it puts out there.
[00:04:51.743 --> 00:04:52.824]  It drives the narrative.
[00:04:52.824 --> 00:04:54.425]  It drives the narrative.
[00:04:54.425 --> 00:04:57.528]  That's a powerful clip from Newsmax.
[00:04:57.528 --> 00:04:58.649]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:04:58.649 --> 00:04:59.330]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.572]  So today I want to talk about killing white people in context.
[00:05:04.572 --> 00:05:15.817]  A Texas A&M professor says that some white people may have to die in order to solve racism and bring about true equality.
[00:05:15.817 --> 00:05:21.179]  When we have this conversation about violence or killing white people, it has to be looked at in this historical term.
[00:05:21.179 --> 00:05:26.962]  And the fact that we've had no one address how relevant and how solidified this kind of tradition is for black people saying,
[00:05:27.142 --> 00:05:31.685]  Look, in order to be equal, in order to be liberated, some white people may have to die.
[00:05:57.262 --> 00:06:00.903]  And you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:00.903 --> 00:06:06.365]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:08.465]  Research across the board is clear.
[00:06:08.465 --> 00:06:13.767]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:06:13.767 --> 00:06:17.508]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants that
[00:06:17.608 --> 00:06:21.051]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[00:06:21.051 --> 00:06:24.234]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[00:06:24.234 --> 00:06:28.117]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[00:06:28.117 --> 00:06:35.283]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[00:06:35.283 --> 00:06:40.668]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[00:06:40.948 --> 00:06:42.989]  Iodine, nanosilver, and more.
[00:06:42.989 --> 00:06:51.273]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubblegum-flavored Superblue that is Spearmint-free.
[00:06:51.273 --> 00:06:59.578]  Learn more about the new Bubblegum-flavored Superblue toothpaste and more at Infowarslife.com and support the Infowar while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[00:07:01.854 --> 00:07:07.338]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[00:07:07.338 --> 00:07:08.179]  I take this.
[00:07:08.179 --> 00:07:09.299]  My family takes this.
[00:07:09.299 --> 00:07:13.603]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[00:07:13.603 --> 00:07:17.826]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:07:18.186 --> 00:07:22.829]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[00:07:22.829 --> 00:07:23.969]  I don't feel good.
[00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:27.731]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[00:07:27.731 --> 00:07:30.413]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[00:07:30.413 --> 00:07:36.216]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[00:07:36.216 --> 00:07:39.178]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[00:07:39.178 --> 00:07:42.720]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.941]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[00:07:44.941 --> 00:07:45.301]  I love it.
[00:07:45.461 --> 00:07:48.262]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[00:07:48.262 --> 00:07:49.282]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:07:49.282 --> 00:07:54.924]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[00:07:54.924 --> 00:07:57.105]  It's got a five-star rating.
[00:07:57.105 --> 00:08:06.609]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[00:08:06.609 --> 00:08:10.870]  You're listening to the Antidote for Fake News.
[00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:12.811]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:14.301 --> 00:08:27.414]  Sometimes I feel I've got to run away I've got to get away from the pain you drive into the heart of me
[00:08:38.172 --> 00:08:41.153]  Ladies and gentlemen, here we are.
[00:08:41.153 --> 00:08:43.053]  It's already Thursday, May 11, 2017.
[00:08:43.053 --> 00:08:46.334]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:08:46.334 --> 00:08:48.435]  Roger Stone is on the ground in New York City.
[00:08:48.435 --> 00:08:50.295]  He was just on the Today Show.
[00:08:50.295 --> 00:08:54.036]  Tomorrow, they say it's one of the biggest hit series ever.
[00:08:54.036 --> 00:08:58.397]  It's what the reviewers are saying, get me Roger Stone, is set to hit
[00:09:00.658 --> 00:09:07.722]  Netflix, we have Michael Snyder getting into the economic and military developments in the world that are obviously very, very serious.
[00:09:07.722 --> 00:09:21.450]  Michael Dabari, the fellow that for five or six years rides around with a Jumbotron TV behind his bicycle in New Orleans, just interviewing people, telling them about Infowars, playing my show live.
[00:09:22.543 --> 00:09:25.985]  He has people come up and give him a lot of praise, donations, you name it.
[00:09:25.985 --> 00:09:30.008]  But also people say they want to kill me, because I'm a brainwasher.
[00:09:30.008 --> 00:09:41.295]  So we're going to have him pop in on the show, and then Anthony Comey will be hosting the fourth hour today.
[00:09:41.295 --> 00:09:47.259]  When you look at the corporate media that works for offshore global banks, that has tried to hijack this country,
[00:09:48.311 --> 00:10:00.435]  And their open hatred of flyover country, their open hatred of the bitter clingers, their open hatred of American strength and honor and will and economic prowess.
[00:10:00.435 --> 00:10:15.880]  And you look at their parasitic activities, selling us out to multinational interests and opening our borders outside of law and violating Congress's lawmaking to let Obama pour in truly unwashed, unvetted
[00:10:17.412 --> 00:10:24.758]  Immigrants from all over the world carrying diseases and political rebellion and islamicist garbage.
[00:10:24.758 --> 00:10:31.684]  It's mind-blowing to see them point their finger at President Trump and call him the traitor and claim he's some type of Russian agent.
[00:10:31.684 --> 00:10:43.353]  And then yesterday he had Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, visit the White House and they had the Russian ambassador to the United States there.
[00:10:43.353 --> 00:10:44.914]  That is totally normal.
[00:10:44.914 --> 00:10:46.856]  That is the default position.
[00:10:49.275 --> 00:11:01.044]  And it's also normal they had a US pool reporter and a Russian pool reporter who was assigned to the Associated Press and Getty Images take photos of the meeting.
[00:11:01.044 --> 00:11:08.449]  And the media spun it that he only had Russian media there and it allowed them to basically plant listening devices in the White House.
[00:11:08.449 --> 00:11:09.870]  Total hysteria!
[00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:11.752]  So they're taking normal meetings
[00:11:12.853 --> 00:11:15.215]  And calling it a sell-out of America.
[00:11:15.215 --> 00:11:22.360]  Normally an American president in the last decade or so would meet with the Russians and the Chinese and the British first.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.341]  Week one.
[00:11:24.341 --> 00:11:29.044]  He met with the Brits week one, met with the Chinese a few months later.
[00:11:29.044 --> 00:11:33.868]  He finally is meeting with the foreign minister and the ambassador on day 111.
[00:11:33.868 --> 00:11:34.648]  That was yesterday.
[00:11:34.648 --> 00:11:35.169]  He's paralyzed!
[00:11:41.601 --> 00:11:50.804]  Can't even meet with the Russians because they'll say he's a Russian spy, and when he does, they say he's letting them plant listening devices in there.
[00:11:50.804 --> 00:11:51.164]  Why?
[00:11:51.164 --> 00:11:52.584]  He'll see the big board!
[00:11:52.584 --> 00:11:54.725]  You can't let the Russians in the war room!
[00:11:54.725 --> 00:12:00.406]  It's got the flavor of Dr. Strangelove hysteria.
[00:12:00.406 --> 00:12:02.467]  Totally normal, and another hoax.
[00:12:05.652 --> 00:12:10.095]  It doesn't matter that there was two pool reporters there, that's customary.
[00:12:10.095 --> 00:12:13.177]  When he met with the Chinese president in private, he also met in public.
[00:12:13.177 --> 00:12:19.661]  There was a Chinese news agency photographer, and there was a US news agency photographer, and a White House photographer.
[00:12:19.661 --> 00:12:22.242]  So I actually read the technicals, there were three photographers there.
[00:12:22.242 --> 00:12:25.885]  White House, US-based, Russian-based.
[00:12:25.885 --> 00:12:29.567]  But that's an example of how the president
[00:12:31.547 --> 00:12:39.333]  It was like Michael Flynn talking to the Russians once he was incoming National Security Advisor about setting up meetings with the President.
[00:12:40.339 --> 00:12:44.282]  And then they had recordings of it, Obama had recordings of it, saying, well, they did discuss sanctions.
[00:12:44.282 --> 00:12:46.084]  The Russians said, can we talk about sanctions?
[00:12:46.084 --> 00:12:48.386]  He said, yeah, the President's open to that, I'm sure.
[00:12:48.386 --> 00:12:50.047]  He said he is in public statements.
[00:12:50.047 --> 00:12:52.209]  That's not talking about the sanctions, technically.
[00:12:52.209 --> 00:12:54.091]  It's lining up a discussion about them.
[00:12:54.091 --> 00:12:56.673]  But see, that's how they play semantical games.
[00:12:56.673 --> 00:12:58.314]  Then they say, oh, we have all the intercepts.
[00:12:58.314 --> 00:12:59.395]  We were tapping them all.
[00:12:59.395 --> 00:13:00.937]  Then they go, oh, no, we never did that.
[00:13:00.937 --> 00:13:03.279]  Trump goes, really, that's illegal and it's a leak.
[00:13:03.279 --> 00:13:06.602]  Now we have the FBI director saying before Congress, it's crazy.
[00:13:07.421 --> 00:13:09.021]  That Obama would tap Trump.
[00:13:09.021 --> 00:13:10.342]  It's just crazy!
[00:13:10.342 --> 00:13:12.182]  Trump is crazy!
[00:13:12.182 --> 00:13:22.365]  The FBI Director says the President is crazy that Obama was surveilling him when it's come out in the Associated Press that thousands of Americans were ordered spied on.
[00:13:22.365 --> 00:13:28.387]  And that, oh, accidentally, you know, they were surveilling the President and then they picked up some stuff.
[00:13:28.387 --> 00:13:29.407]  That's not crazy.
[00:13:29.407 --> 00:13:32.388]  The FBI Director is saying, Trump says the sun came up this morning.
[00:13:32.388 --> 00:13:32.968]  He's crazy!
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.841]  And in the middle of this, we get to hear Roger Stone's a Russian agent.
[00:13:37.841 --> 00:13:39.101]  He's under investigation.
[00:13:39.101 --> 00:13:49.223]  I told Roger yesterday, I said, we ought to go to a press conference at the National Press Club and demand we be called before this committee, because I've been attacked as a Russian operative only like 1% as much as he has.
[00:13:49.223 --> 00:13:53.104]  I mean, it's every day, every channel, but you never see any evidence.
[00:13:53.104 --> 00:13:54.724]  You never get to face your accuser.
[00:13:54.724 --> 00:13:56.085]  It's baloney world.
[00:13:56.085 --> 00:14:01.226]  We've got Roger Stone at the bottom of the hour with us, popping in, because we have big news.
[00:14:02.361 --> 00:14:04.062]  I called Roger last night for my sources.
[00:14:04.062 --> 00:14:05.502]  I have my other sources.
[00:14:05.502 --> 00:14:08.583]  I called some of my other people that have White House sources.
[00:14:08.583 --> 00:14:14.705]  And then I called Roger, and he said, well, I really hate to confirm a lot of what you're saying because I don't want to give away my sources.
[00:14:14.705 --> 00:14:21.248]  Because obviously if he talks too much about his intel, then he might get curtailed on those high-level sources.
[00:14:21.248 --> 00:14:23.508]  But we have big news.
[00:14:23.508 --> 00:14:29.431]  From my sources, Spicer's basically already gone.
[00:14:29.431 --> 00:14:30.611]  Trump's looking for a replacement.
[00:14:31.437 --> 00:14:38.975]  And this latest lady, uh, whereas she's full spoken, she just doesn't probably have the long-term stamina and can't handle the media pecking at her.
[00:14:38.975 --> 00:14:40.559]  So I don't, I don't think that this, uh,
[00:14:43.175 --> 00:15:06.124]  Sarah Huckabee Sanders is going to be there that long and so Trump's on the lookout for a new press secretary because we do have Spicer hiding in the bushes and you know he clarified he was amongst the bushes hiding from the press but not hiding in the bushes same thing and then we've also got the big news that Priebus is being looked at to be terminated but one at a time and here's the big news President Trump is taking the gloves off
[00:15:06.994 --> 00:15:08.035]  He's tried to compromise.
[00:15:08.035 --> 00:15:09.195]  He's tried to work with people.
[00:15:09.195 --> 00:15:14.518]  He's seen the FBI do nothing to guard for the Clintons, or the spying, or the wiretapping, or the arrogance.
[00:15:14.518 --> 00:15:15.579]  And Comey's arrogant.
[00:15:15.579 --> 00:15:17.240]  The former CIA director's arrogant.
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.321]  They're all a bunch of arrogant swamp dwellers.
[00:15:20.854 --> 00:15:26.176]  And the President knows they're trying to bring him down, he knows they're full of prunes, and he's going after them.
[00:15:26.176 --> 00:15:33.778]  So joining us via the phone in New York City is Roger Stone, one of the most demonized men in America, along with myself.
[00:15:33.778 --> 00:15:44.841]  I think this is quite a club to be in, when these enemies that have hijacked our country keep claiming we're the foreign operatives, when they're the ones that have sold this country out, and Trump's now ending that, so they're panicking.
[00:15:44.841 --> 00:15:48.662]  So thank you for joining us, great swamp creature slayer, Roger Stone.
[00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:54.954]  Alex, I'm delighted to be among the MVPs with you.
[00:15:54.954 --> 00:16:00.237]  It's an exclusive club, but I'm proud to be your friend.
[00:16:00.237 --> 00:16:02.479]  Where should we start here?
[00:16:02.479 --> 00:16:04.340]  You just heard what I let out from my sources.
[00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:07.963]  I know you don't really want to get into your details much, but what can you tell people?
[00:16:08.939 --> 00:16:15.281]  Well, first of all, I can confirm much of what you learned from my own independent sources.
[00:16:15.281 --> 00:16:23.243]  I think, in fact, Sean Spicer is on his way out with never a particularly good fit.
[00:16:23.243 --> 00:16:25.804]  He has upgraded his clothing a little bit, but
[00:16:26.477 --> 00:16:28.258]  He's not Trump's kind of guy.
[00:16:28.258 --> 00:16:31.719]  He's not a true believer in the Trump agenda.
[00:16:31.719 --> 00:16:35.200]  He came from the Republican National Committee.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:47.845]  You'll recall back in September of last year, Norrison said if Trump doesn't get these poll numbers back, the RNC will have to suspend its financial support of the Republican nominee for president.
[00:16:47.845 --> 00:16:49.405]  Unheard of.
[00:16:49.405 --> 00:16:49.886]  Unheard of.
[00:16:49.886 --> 00:16:54.607]  Dick Nixon, Ronald Reagan would be rolling in their graves.
[00:16:54.607 --> 00:16:55.928]  The Republican National Committee.
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.482]  Roger, we got your phone dying there.
[00:17:02.482 --> 00:17:08.310]  Yes, your phone's breaking up.
[00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:09.151]  We're going to call you right back.
[00:17:09.151 --> 00:17:11.354]  We're going to call Roger Stone right back and reconnect.
[00:17:11.354 --> 00:17:13.236]  He's on the streets there in New York City.
[00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:17.382]  This just broke on InfoWars.com.
[00:17:17.382 --> 00:17:21.706]  White House source, Spicer out as Trump begins purge of establishment advisors.
[00:17:21.706 --> 00:17:26.491]  Fox News host, Kimberly Guilfoyle, set to be new press secretary as president at Clean House.
[00:17:26.491 --> 00:17:28.813]  Obviously I gave Paul the sources.
[00:17:28.813 --> 00:17:32.737]  We probably need to update that or not correct it but clarify it.
[00:17:32.737 --> 00:17:36.320]  Kimberly Guilfoyle is being looked at.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.601]  Is being looked at.
[00:17:38.602 --> 00:17:44.166]  And she was passed over once, so the word is from Trump, is he said, do you think she'd still do it?
[00:17:44.166 --> 00:17:48.009]  So she's certainly being looked at and is in the front running seat.
[00:17:48.009 --> 00:17:54.835]  So Fox News' Kimberly Guilfoyle is in the lead to get the new press secretary job, we should say.
[00:17:54.835 --> 00:17:55.675]  She's in the lead.
[00:17:56.596 --> 00:18:08.984]  To clarify that, White House sources tell InfoWars that Sean Spicer is set to be fired as President Trump begins a purge of establishment advisors who he feels have failed to properly investigate leaks coming from within the administration.
[00:18:08.984 --> 00:18:17.870]  Speculation is already swirling as to whether or not Spicer will return after he was benched and temporarily replaced with Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
[00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:27.314]  Sources tell InfoWars that Spicer has behaved like a deer in the headlights in recent weeks, that's a quote from the president, and is not able to handle the pressure of the job.
[00:18:27.314 --> 00:18:37.999]  InfoWars can reveal that Spicer will be gone by next week, and that his replacement is likely to be former prosecutor and current Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle, who was previously considered for the role.
[00:18:39.397 --> 00:18:40.278]  Let's go back to Roger Stone.
[00:18:40.278 --> 00:18:41.298]  Roger, your phone cut out.
[00:18:41.298 --> 00:18:44.161]  Let's continue back with what you were trying to get out to people.
[00:19:03.277 --> 00:19:09.286]  Yeah, I think I was going to make the point that Sarah Huckabee is an excellent number two.
[00:19:10.487 --> 00:19:13.408]  It's important that you have a backup spokesperson.
[00:19:13.408 --> 00:19:17.489]  I think she's done a very good job the last several days.
[00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:37.234]  And as you indicated, if they are able to recruit Kimberly Guilfoyle, a former prosecutor, Fox News commentator, Hispanic woman, sharp as a tack, very close to the president and his wife personally, that would be a 10 strike.
[00:19:37.234 --> 00:19:38.094]  A Trump loyalist.
[00:19:38.988 --> 00:19:41.450]  So, I'm very optimistic.
[00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:44.271]  I hear as you do that that is going to happen.
[00:19:44.271 --> 00:19:58.660]  I know the President looked at her earlier for this, felt it was important to let Reince Priebus have his own man, a decision I think he now regrets.
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:05.684]  The other thing, Alex, that I think is notable is General McMaster, as Mike Cernovich reported on this program,
[00:20:06.494 --> 00:20:11.616]  A week ago does appear in fact to be on his way out.
[00:20:11.616 --> 00:20:15.958]  The chemistry between he and the president is just not good.
[00:20:15.958 --> 00:20:17.199]  I don't think they're going to dump him.
[00:20:17.199 --> 00:20:19.380]  I think they're going to promote him.
[00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:22.761]  He's clearly highly capable in the right job.
[00:20:22.761 --> 00:20:28.764]  I'm not sure this is the right job because I think he carries the neocon water.
[00:20:28.764 --> 00:20:32.826]  Let's remember he and General Mattis together wanted to send 150,000 troops
[00:20:37.108 --> 00:20:39.249]  So continually his own man.
[00:20:39.249 --> 00:20:42.750]  What about the hoax that you got Trump to make the decision to
[00:20:58.826 --> 00:21:11.078]  I mean, it was known at the time when President Trump got elected and when he got inaugurated that he was looking at Comey and that it was basically on the bubble 50-50 whether he was going to get rid of him just because of his bizarre behavior.
[00:21:11.078 --> 00:21:17.144]  And then now his statement that he got nauseous, that he helped Trump get elected, totally political.
[00:21:17.144 --> 00:21:20.247]  And then, of course, he's in the news saying Trump was crazy.
[00:21:20.948 --> 00:21:22.690]  To think Obama surveilled him?
[00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:24.332]  Well, Trump's the president now.
[00:21:24.332 --> 00:21:25.453]  He knows he was surveilled.
[00:21:25.453 --> 00:21:29.178]  He's had the head of the House Intelligence Committee, Nunes, tell him that.
[00:21:29.178 --> 00:21:30.199]  But he's the president.
[00:21:30.199 --> 00:21:31.260]  He's got access to all that.
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:33.763]  He just can't say it because it's a national security issue.
[00:21:33.763 --> 00:21:35.866]  So they're hiding behind all the secrecy.
[00:21:36.326 --> 00:21:46.473]  To cover up the crimes they've committed and now the Associated Press reported last week, so did Breitbart, that Obama sought NSA intel on thousands of Americans Trump campaigned during election.
[00:21:46.473 --> 00:21:47.713]  That's what they did.
[00:21:47.713 --> 00:21:48.654]  They've been caught.
[00:21:48.654 --> 00:21:54.658]  They were on the front page of the York Times 15 times naming you by name on January 20th.
[00:21:54.658 --> 00:22:03.664]  They had two articles saying that they had the intercepts of Roger Stone and of your former campaign partner, business partner, Manafort,
[00:22:04.424 --> 00:22:07.126]  All with the Russians getting orders.
[00:22:07.126 --> 00:22:10.228]  The truth is they were surveilling you, but there's nothing there.
[00:22:10.228 --> 00:22:12.289]  Nunes has read the transcripts.
[00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:15.851]  It's all a load of horse crap, like you said on January 20th.
[00:22:15.851 --> 00:22:18.773]  Yeah, it's a witch hunt.
[00:22:18.773 --> 00:22:21.595]  It's a scandal in search of evidence.
[00:22:21.595 --> 00:22:26.518]  You're exactly right, Alex, and this one is pretty easy.
[00:22:27.418 --> 00:22:35.567]  CNN and Politico both reported that I persuaded the President to fire James Comey.
[00:22:35.567 --> 00:22:38.651]  And the President put out a tweet saying that wasn't the case.
[00:22:38.651 --> 00:22:40.012]  Because it's James Comey!
[00:22:40.012 --> 00:22:42.215]  It's James Comey that got him fired!
[00:22:42.215 --> 00:22:43.756]  It's Hillary that lost the election!
[00:22:43.756 --> 00:22:44.897]  It's their fault!
[00:22:44.897 --> 00:22:45.698]  Their fault!
[00:22:45.698 --> 00:22:47.000]  Take responsibility!
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.562]  Stop calling us Russian agents!
[00:22:49.787 --> 00:22:51.128]  Yeah, no, you're exactly right.
[00:22:51.128 --> 00:23:02.212]  And in this case, as you know, I have always taken the position that I was not going to comment on the scope or the subject or the frequency of my calls with the president.
[00:23:02.212 --> 00:23:03.673]  I'm not going to start now.
[00:23:03.673 --> 00:23:05.514]  And I'm not going to contradict him.
[00:23:07.636 --> 00:23:22.951]  Since I know the President watches InfoWars, and since I know he reads Film Club Truth, my view on Comey and the fact that he should have been fired back seconds after Trump, because they took his hand off the Bible, would be well known to him.
[00:23:22.951 --> 00:23:24.813]  No one tells Donald Trump what to do.
[00:23:24.813 --> 00:23:26.414]  No one.
[00:23:26.414 --> 00:23:28.096]  Other than maybe the American people.
[00:23:29.372 --> 00:23:31.713]  I'll tell you this, here's their biggest problem, Roger.
[00:23:31.713 --> 00:23:35.055]  They said fire Comey for the last 3-4 months constantly.
[00:23:35.055 --> 00:23:36.576]  Hillary said it last week.
[00:23:36.576 --> 00:23:37.736]  Now she loves him.
[00:23:37.736 --> 00:23:49.302]  So, if everybody's saying fire Comey and he's doing weird stuff, and is on a power trip just like Brennan was, I can't believe Brennan couldn't believe he was fired when he told the President, watch your mouth.
[00:23:49.302 --> 00:23:50.783]  What are these people's problems?
[00:23:51.789 --> 00:23:52.729]  Because they're elites.
[00:23:52.729 --> 00:23:54.970]  They're arrogant, ruling elites.
[00:23:54.970 --> 00:24:01.532]  And they think they're more powerful than our elected officials to whom they're supposed to be responsible.
[00:24:01.532 --> 00:24:02.653]  Which shows the power trip.
[00:24:02.653 --> 00:24:05.814]  Imagine to his face telling him, watch your mouth.
[00:24:05.814 --> 00:24:08.515]  Imagine the FBI director saying he's crazy.
[00:24:08.515 --> 00:24:10.815]  I mean, these people are arrogant.
[00:24:10.815 --> 00:24:12.916]  What is their problem?
[00:24:12.916 --> 00:24:18.358]  Well, this morning when I was on CNN with Chris Cuomo, we had a very spirited
[00:24:20.737 --> 00:24:28.380]  He told me that his sources in the FBI told him that the agency, the morale had hit rock bottom.
[00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:30.780]  They were distraught over the fire of coma.
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:32.161]  What planet does he live on?
[00:24:32.992 --> 00:24:37.493]  The agents I've talked to, and I know many, they're a bullion over his firing.
[00:24:37.493 --> 00:24:42.914]  They believe he politicized this agency, and he tarnished its image for integrity.
[00:24:42.914 --> 00:24:43.994]  Let's go further.
[00:24:43.994 --> 00:24:48.095]  The new director's wife is a huge Democrat that gave $600,000 to Hillary.
[00:24:48.095 --> 00:24:50.095]  The acting FBI director is a Clinton ally.
[00:24:50.095 --> 00:24:51.515]  Infowars.com.
[00:24:51.515 --> 00:24:55.856]  Jamie White likely has his time at the FBI, will be short as the head.
[00:24:55.856 --> 00:24:59.377]  Trump's got to get rid of all these Democratic operatives that have politicized.
[00:24:59.377 --> 00:25:01.197]  They're going to claim this is another Russian cover-up.
[00:25:01.397 --> 00:25:04.218]  There's nobody covering up the Russian thing because there's nothing there.
[00:25:04.218 --> 00:25:05.699]  Let's play your clip from NBC.
[00:25:05.699 --> 00:25:07.139]  Here's Roger Stone.
[00:25:07.139 --> 00:25:08.580]  We asked just a couple of questions.
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.020]  Has the FBI contacted you yet?
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:10.500]  They have not.
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:11.601]  Still has not contacted you?
[00:25:11.601 --> 00:25:11.801]  Have not.
[00:25:11.801 --> 00:25:13.642]  Has there been any subpoena from any?
[00:25:13.642 --> 00:25:14.002]  Have not.
[00:25:14.002 --> 00:25:18.924]  From Congress, from a grand jury, from any federal authority for any of your documents or any information from you?
[00:25:18.924 --> 00:25:24.746]  In view of the fact that my lawyers believe that I was hacked and they have all that material, I don't think they need to subpoena it.
[00:25:24.746 --> 00:25:25.086]  Have they?
[00:25:25.666 --> 00:25:26.667]  I have no legal jeopardy.
[00:25:26.667 --> 00:25:28.789]  The idea of Russian collusion is a canard.
[00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:29.389]  It's a falsehood.
[00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:56.732]  I'm so sick of this.
[00:25:56.732 --> 00:25:59.857]  I mean, I would tell Roger at dinner, hey, stop getting so mad.
[00:25:59.857 --> 00:26:04.683]  I mean, he started, I've known Roger, I met him like four or five years ago, but known him good for like two years.
[00:26:04.683 --> 00:26:06.226]  He started just getting really cussing, getting mad.
[00:26:06.226 --> 00:26:09.891]  And then when they accused me of actually being run by the Russians, I got mad because
[00:26:10.692 --> 00:26:14.156]  It's like saying, you know, you're a rapist when you're not or you're a child molester.
[00:26:14.156 --> 00:26:31.196]  I mean, it's like defaming you by a bunch of globalist traitors that have sold the country out and are trying to overthrow the president who just wants to cut taxes and empower the middle class again and defend our borders and bring back sovereignty and then these scum, these arrogant scum, Roger.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.602]  Yeah, no, you got these elitist pukes, and they're accusing us of treason.
[00:26:37.602 --> 00:26:44.364]  Look, I know a lot of liberals who I think are misguided and wrong, but I think they're loyal Americans.
[00:26:44.364 --> 00:26:50.047]  I just think they're misinformed and they're incorrect, but I think they're loyal Americans.
[00:26:50.047 --> 00:26:57.449]  This is a whole new thing, where if you're not for thermonuclear war with the Russians over Syria, well then you must be a traitor to the United States.
[00:26:57.449 --> 00:27:00.611]  You must be in Vladimir Putin's pocket.
[00:27:00.611 --> 00:27:03.432]  Donald Trump has no illusions about the Russian gulag.
[00:27:04.133 --> 00:27:11.855]  He has no illusions about how rotten their system is, the way the Russians oppress gays and Christians and Jews.
[00:27:11.855 --> 00:27:19.437]  He knows it's a rotten system, but he'd like to try to sit down and negotiate a fair peace before we go to thermonuclear war.
[00:27:19.437 --> 00:27:20.237]  Well, let's expand.
[00:27:20.237 --> 00:27:21.397]  Russia's not expanding.
[00:27:21.397 --> 00:27:22.638]  Russia's not trying to take over.
[00:27:22.638 --> 00:27:24.918]  A lot of that stuff they say Russia does is exaggerated.
[00:27:24.918 --> 00:27:26.619]  Compared to the Muslims?
[00:27:26.619 --> 00:27:28.579]  I mean, the Muslims are crawling all over us.
[00:27:28.579 --> 00:27:29.739]  Russia's not doing anything.
[00:27:29.739 --> 00:27:31.460]  It's fighting our shared enemy.
[00:27:33.776 --> 00:27:41.021]  And frankly, if we could put our differences aside and work together to crush ISIS, we'd be far, far worth it.
[00:27:41.021 --> 00:27:41.762]  Let me ask you this.
[00:27:41.762 --> 00:27:44.744]  I got from my sources that Trump is white hot mad.
[00:27:44.744 --> 00:27:46.165]  CNN says that too.
[00:27:46.165 --> 00:27:48.147]  That he yells and cusses at the television.
[00:27:48.147 --> 00:27:49.648]  It's not that he's hiding the Russia thing.
[00:27:49.648 --> 00:27:54.151]  He's so angry because he has all the intel of what the Clintons did with Russia and China.
[00:27:54.151 --> 00:27:56.993]  And he's been saying, do something to the Attorney General.
[00:27:56.993 --> 00:28:00.375]  I'm sick of being accused of what I haven't done and that Comey wouldn't do anything.
[00:28:00.375 --> 00:28:01.256]  That's not him trying to.
[00:28:01.796 --> 00:28:05.057]  Yeah, first of all, I have a number of questions today, Alex.
[00:28:05.057 --> 00:28:07.958]  People are asking me whether the President is distraught.
[00:28:19.231 --> 00:28:20.192]  No, he's none of those things.
[00:28:20.192 --> 00:28:23.735]  He's actually in an incredibly good mood.
[00:28:23.735 --> 00:28:24.936]  He's a fighter.
[00:28:24.936 --> 00:28:26.957]  He likes to fight for what he believes in.
[00:28:26.957 --> 00:28:29.820]  He's not going to back down from a fight.
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:36.265]  I think he's having the time of his life because he realizes this is the fight for America's future.
[00:28:38.251 --> 00:28:44.853]  This idea that he is, you know, somehow hiding in the bushes or that he's shook from his agenda, none of that is true.
[00:28:44.853 --> 00:28:45.453]  None of it.
[00:28:45.453 --> 00:28:50.875]  In fact, who's hiding is a bunch of people under him that are cowards and do think mainstream media is still God.
[00:28:50.875 --> 00:28:58.638]  And I mean, I've seen Spicer, he acts like a deer in the headlights and yells out to the press, Comey's fired and kind of hides and looks shaken.
[00:28:58.638 --> 00:28:59.498]  What's his problem?
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:14.500]  Well, I think that some on the White House staff, perhaps him, are the ones who put out this story yesterday that appeared in Politico, picked up by CNN, that I had advised the president to fire Comey.
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:15.542]  Their reasoning is simple.
[00:29:16.102 --> 00:29:20.487]  Roger Stone, Nixon, Saturday Night Massacre.
[00:29:20.487 --> 00:29:27.294]  The way we poison the idea of firing Comey is to attribute it to Roger Stone.
[00:29:27.294 --> 00:29:27.794]  That's right.
[00:29:27.794 --> 00:29:28.515]  No one.
[00:29:28.515 --> 00:29:28.875]  Stay there.
[00:29:28.875 --> 00:29:29.776]  Let's do five more minutes.
[00:29:29.776 --> 00:29:37.664]  I ain't gotta go, but five more because they want to, his own people undermine him, cripple him, and make him a creature of the deep state.
[00:29:38.445 --> 00:29:41.809]  And Trump is understanding they're not complying, they're not helping him restore the republic.
[00:29:41.809 --> 00:29:43.391]  They're a bunch of rats.
[00:29:43.391 --> 00:29:48.918]  And he's lining up the political guillotines for Spicer, Priebus, and all the other vat of turds.
[00:29:48.918 --> 00:29:50.080]  We'll be back.
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.461]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.461 --> 00:29:53.984]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.984 --> 00:29:56.688]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.936 --> 00:30:04.577]  So today I want to talk about killing white people in context.
[00:30:04.577 --> 00:30:15.822]  A Texas A&M professor says that some white people may have to die in order to solve racism and bring about true equality.
[00:30:15.822 --> 00:30:21.204]  When we have this conversation about violence or killing white people, it has to be looked at in this historical term.
[00:30:21.204 --> 00:30:29.947]  And the fact that we've had no one address how relevant and how solidified this kind of tradition is for black people saying, look, in order to be equal, in order to be liberated,
[00:30:30.427 --> 00:30:31.768]  White people may have to die.
[00:30:31.768 --> 00:30:41.875]  That was Professor Tommy Curry on the Reading News Review podcast who went on to say that the movie Django Unchained made killing white people look fun.
[00:30:41.875 --> 00:30:46.478]  But in reality, it should be part of a serious discussion.
[00:30:46.478 --> 00:30:56.985]  So far, it is unknown if law enforcement officials or Homeland Security are investigating Tommy Curry for his violent, racist, and terroristic threats.
[00:30:57.205 --> 00:30:57.945]  We're good to go.
[00:31:18.652 --> 00:31:19.433]  And the best part?

[00:32:00.603 --> 00:32:06.007]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:32:06.007 --> 00:32:08.869]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[00:32:08.869 --> 00:32:10.850]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:15.873]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[00:32:15.873 --> 00:32:17.954]  Research across the board is clear.
[00:32:17.954 --> 00:32:19.255]  In fact, it's certified.
[00:32:19.255 --> 00:32:24.359]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:32:24.359 --> 00:32:27.721]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[00:32:27.861 --> 00:32:31.242]  That your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[00:32:31.242 --> 00:32:34.222]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[00:32:34.222 --> 00:32:37.923]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[00:32:37.923 --> 00:32:44.824]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[00:32:44.824 --> 00:32:52.345]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.

[00:33:13.461 --> 00:33:19.565]  Somewhere along the way... In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[00:33:19.565 --> 00:33:22.648]  I'll be looking for aid when they pull that gate.
[00:33:23.607 --> 00:33:28.537]  And I hope that judge ain't blind.
[00:33:28.537 --> 00:33:33.768]  Amarillo by morning, Amarillo's on my mind.
[00:33:42.739 --> 00:33:44.319]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:44.319 --> 00:33:45.780]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:47.100]  Roger Stone is our guest.
[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:49.640]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:53.041]  Roger's gonna fly out here Sunday and be in studio with us.
[00:33:53.041 --> 00:34:00.903]  On Monday, we've got a lot of big stuff we're planning concerning the launch of basically what is a TV network slash radio network.
[00:34:00.903 --> 00:34:03.203]  So very, very exciting things happening.
[00:34:03.203 --> 00:34:05.464]  This broadcast is on over 200 stations now.
[00:34:06.144 --> 00:34:13.028]  And if we can get other shows launched, working with GCN hopefully, I've got to get the programs codified and launched here in the next few months.
[00:34:13.028 --> 00:34:19.011]  But regardless, on our own satellites, it's going to be very, very, very exciting to see all these new shows out there.
[00:34:19.011 --> 00:34:24.994]  I think a lot of our affiliates are going to end up picking up a lot of those transmissions.
[00:34:26.334 --> 00:34:31.196]  So we're talking about reaching tens of millions more people just exponentially here.
[00:34:31.196 --> 00:34:34.517]  So it's a very, very exciting time to be alive.
[00:34:34.517 --> 00:34:37.297]  I played this at the start of the broadcast, but I didn't get to all of it.
[00:34:37.297 --> 00:34:55.303]  I want to play Pat Buchanan on a Newsmax program last night where he really talks about the fact that the media is the real enemy, is the fourth of state, is the opposition party, and is absolutely dedicated, they admitted this at the White House Correspondents Dinner, to destroying this president.
[00:34:56.741 --> 00:35:07.963]  He had the Russian Foreign Minister and the Russian Ambassador there, and they acted like he was with Russian spies, and that he was behind closed doors because there was only a Russian photographer, when there wasn't just a Russian photographer.
[00:35:07.963 --> 00:35:10.604]  There was a White House photographer and another pool photographer.
[00:35:10.604 --> 00:35:14.645]  Then they said, oh, he let Russians plant bugs in there.
[00:35:14.645 --> 00:35:16.785]  They're trying to paralyze the President.
[00:35:16.785 --> 00:35:20.826]  When the President's supposed to talk to the Russian leaders, he should have already met with Putin.
[00:35:21.884 --> 00:35:23.545]  And Ron Paul has pointed this out.
[00:35:23.545 --> 00:35:36.249]  This is unbelievable bullying by a group of people that are hell-bent on stopping the president from having any international power and being able to have any real effect on the world.
[00:35:36.249 --> 00:35:39.451]  It's the deep state, the bureaucracy that wants full control.
[00:35:39.451 --> 00:35:40.751]  It's not a conspiracy.
[00:35:40.751 --> 00:35:41.351]  It's out in the open.
[00:35:41.351 --> 00:35:42.712]  I want to get Roger Stone's take on this.
[00:35:42.712 --> 00:35:49.735]  They don't want to ask Roger Stone on who he thinks would make a good new FBI director.
[00:35:49.735 --> 00:35:50.735]  But first, here's Pat Buchanan.
[00:35:51.533 --> 00:35:57.178]  There's a cultural left and a political left and a media, if you will, a conglomerate.
[00:35:57.178 --> 00:36:04.405]  It's not a conspiracy, but it is collusion and they were determined to break and bring down Nixon from the day he was nominated.
[00:36:04.405 --> 00:36:07.408]  They determined, tried to break and bring, and they succeeded.
[00:36:07.408 --> 00:36:10.291]  Tried to break and bring down Reagan over Iran-Contra.
[00:36:10.291 --> 00:36:11.252]  I was in the White House then.
[00:36:11.852 --> 00:36:16.317]  And the same forces, similar forces, are trying to break and bring down Trump.
[00:36:16.317 --> 00:36:18.620]  And it's transparent, it's right in front of us.
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:25.968]  I mean, you can't watch those briefings and things and watch TV, cable TV and the rest of it, without seeing.
[00:36:25.968 --> 00:36:27.650]  This is a real, there's a real animus.
[00:36:28.311 --> 00:36:30.571]  I mean, it's the White House Correspondents' Dinner.
[00:36:30.571 --> 00:36:35.573]  Steve Bannon was dead right when he said one thing, the media are the opposition party.
[00:36:35.573 --> 00:36:45.435]  Well, you know, Nixon said, when I was an editorial writer, one of the youngest editorial writers on a major paper in America, you know, back in 1962, 3, 4, 5.
[00:36:45.435 --> 00:36:48.455]  But I'd go into the Columbia School of Journalism, so I didn't hate journalism.
[00:36:48.455 --> 00:36:51.136]  I was proud, you know, they regarded these guys at the Times as...
[00:36:51.816 --> 00:36:54.238]  Got to Nixon, he said the press is the enemy.
[00:36:54.238 --> 00:36:57.160]  You know, and I didn't believe it until later on.
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:59.502]  But Trump said the press is the enemy of the people.
[00:36:59.502 --> 00:37:01.143]  It is the same thing.
[00:37:01.143 --> 00:37:08.348]  But let me say, you know, Teddy White wrote a chapter in his book on 1972 about Nixon versus the press and described them as the real enemies.
[00:37:08.348 --> 00:37:11.130]  Number one, two, and three, CBS, Washington Post, New York Times.
[00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:19.899]  And he said, you know, the press has inordinate power because it decides what people will talk about and think about, what it puts out there.
[00:37:19.899 --> 00:37:20.980]  It drives the narrative.
[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:32.453]  It drives the narrative, and it's like, you know, it's one of these large mosaics, and it'll take that light and shine on one piece of the mosaic, and all these other things going on are forgotten.
[00:37:33.614 --> 00:37:43.597]  That's exactly how it is because you'll look at a big mosaic tile wall in a building and it's this incredible image of a vista or of people or of space travel.
[00:37:43.597 --> 00:37:44.237]  We've all seen them.
[00:37:44.237 --> 00:37:49.879]  Some of the best mosaic work I've seen has been in like Spain and Italy and Mexico.
[00:37:49.879 --> 00:37:53.080]  But imagine the media just focuses in on one little piece.
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:54.801]  Oh look!
[00:37:54.801 --> 00:37:58.562]  Alex Jones says he hates gay people and then it's an edited tape!
[00:37:58.562 --> 00:38:01.303]  It's not even a real piece of mosaic!
[00:38:01.303 --> 00:38:02.143]  It's a lie!
[00:38:03.263 --> 00:38:04.984]  And folks, you've got to understand how outrageous it is.
[00:38:04.984 --> 00:38:07.305]  It isn't about Roger Stone or Alex Jones.
[00:38:07.305 --> 00:38:09.205]  It's about what are we saying that has them so scared?
[00:38:09.205 --> 00:38:11.186]  Well, it's the truth.
[00:38:11.186 --> 00:38:13.087]  And they're saying we're Russian agents.
[00:38:13.087 --> 00:38:14.868]  We're not just influence.
[00:38:14.868 --> 00:38:18.089]  We're getting directed by the Russians.
[00:38:18.089 --> 00:38:23.591]  And Maxine Waters says, Trump got drained of swamp from Putin.
[00:38:23.591 --> 00:38:24.652]  He gets on the phone with him.
[00:38:25.856 --> 00:38:28.177]  And he got Crooked Hillary from him.
[00:38:28.177 --> 00:38:37.639]  I mean, how dumb is that woman that she doesn't think Donald Trump, who's been coming up with some of the best insults ever, they've got books written about all his insults.
[00:38:37.639 --> 00:38:39.239]  I can't come up with insults?
[00:38:39.239 --> 00:38:41.060]  Roger Stone can't come up with insults?
[00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:43.040]  He was coming up with them for Nixon 40 years ago?
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:46.121]  When I was a baby?
[00:38:47.665 --> 00:38:49.225]  We don't have our own brains.
[00:38:49.225 --> 00:38:50.806]  I didn't build Infowars.
[00:38:50.806 --> 00:38:52.406]  You didn't build your operation.
[00:38:52.406 --> 00:38:56.727]  And it's the arrogance of Obama and the globalists saying you didn't build your business.
[00:38:56.727 --> 00:39:06.770]  These people have all been coddled, put in their positions of power, Nancy Pelosi, and so that's why they think everybody else is getting fed stuff because they're puppets.
[00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:07.970]  Listen, Pelosi.
[00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:09.691]  Listen, Waters.
[00:39:09.691 --> 00:39:10.691]  We're not puppets.
[00:39:10.691 --> 00:39:12.671]  We're real people.
[00:39:12.671 --> 00:39:14.512]  There's no teleprompters here, sweetheart.
[00:39:15.552 --> 00:39:18.354]  In fact, you guys take this camera, or the document cam, and show people.
[00:39:18.354 --> 00:39:20.495]  There's no teleprompter in here.
[00:39:20.495 --> 00:39:21.495]  I'm gonna go to Roger right now.
[00:39:21.495 --> 00:39:22.656]  He's on the phone in the New York streets.
[00:39:22.656 --> 00:39:23.617]  I don't want to make him hold.
[00:39:23.617 --> 00:39:24.897]  Look at this.
[00:39:24.897 --> 00:39:25.317]  Study.
[00:39:25.317 --> 00:39:28.839]  Media job salary soared 38% in the era of Trump.
[00:39:28.839 --> 00:39:29.480]  Time Magazine.
[00:39:30.336 --> 00:39:32.156]  I don't need a teleprompter to tell me what that means.
[00:39:32.156 --> 00:39:42.079]  These parasites, who were about to go bankrupt, finally have jobs again, and are getting bonuses, because Trump's made things interesting again, because it's not just two parties working together.
[00:39:42.079 --> 00:39:51.061]  And the jobs and the money for everybody's getting better, and even though he's making it better for them, they still want to destroy him, because they're parasites!
[00:39:51.061 --> 00:39:52.382]  Cancer is a parasite.
[00:39:52.382 --> 00:39:56.563]  It doesn't know it's going to kill its host, it just keeps growing and growing and growing, and thinking it's dominant.
[00:39:57.489 --> 00:39:59.290]  Cancer's not dominant.
[00:39:59.290 --> 00:39:59.870]  I'm ranting.
[00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:00.430]  I apologize.
[00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:01.370]  Roger, finish up your point.
[00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:01.890]  I want you to get in.
[00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:03.171]  You're coming to Austin.
[00:40:03.171 --> 00:40:03.791]  Other TedBets.
[00:40:03.791 --> 00:40:11.313]  And then also, I want to ask you, I know that you've talked to some little birdies and people and have heard some of the names swarming around.
[00:40:11.313 --> 00:40:15.515]  Obviously, we've talked about who the president reportedly is considering, if he can get her.
[00:40:16.495 --> 00:40:19.317]  Uh, is, of course, Gilfoyle of Fox News fame.
[00:40:19.317 --> 00:40:23.140]  A great, very competent, focused, smart prosecutor and journalist.
[00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:24.521]  Would do a great job.
[00:40:24.521 --> 00:40:26.862]  Obviously, this age of claiming there's a glass ceiling.
[00:40:26.862 --> 00:40:28.163]  Could we see a woman?
[00:40:28.163 --> 00:40:31.946]  The first FBI... I mean, I know we already had one woman, and it's okay that he was a tranny.
[00:40:31.946 --> 00:40:33.166]  I'm not against trannies.
[00:40:33.166 --> 00:40:34.347]  We had J. Edgar Hoover.
[00:40:34.347 --> 00:40:36.689]  So, but could we actually have a biological, real woman?
[00:40:36.689 --> 00:40:39.391]  I know Bill Nye says chromosomes don't have anything to do with it.
[00:40:39.391 --> 00:40:41.972]  So should we get a female FBI director?
[00:40:41.972 --> 00:40:46.015]  Or maybe, uh, maybe make Caitlyn Jenner, uh, the new FBI director?
[00:40:47.136 --> 00:40:59.005]  No, actually, I was thinking of Judge Jeanine Pirro, former prosecutor, respected judge, smart as a whip, tough as nails, a tremendous reputation for integrity.
[00:40:59.005 --> 00:41:03.308]  Yeah, I think we should have a woman FBI director.
[00:41:03.308 --> 00:41:08.772]  We've obviously had an FBI director who wore a dress before, but we've never had an actual female.
[00:41:08.772 --> 00:41:10.854]  Actually, I don't think that's true, by the way.
[00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:14.633]  That's a story for another day.
[00:41:14.633 --> 00:41:15.894]  It would be excellent.
[00:41:15.894 --> 00:41:20.579]  I thought Pat Buchanan was making a key point, but I would make this observation.
[00:41:20.579 --> 00:41:33.753]  Things have changed a bit since Pat was in his heyday, even when he was giving valuable service to Ronald Reagan, because of the rise of a vibrant and robust alternative media.
[00:41:34.798 --> 00:41:42.864]  What's really driving the mainstream media and the elitist media crazy is that they no longer have a monopoly.
[00:41:42.864 --> 00:41:44.065]  They have to compete now.
[00:41:44.065 --> 00:41:56.033]  They have to compete with Infowars.com and Breitbart and Daily Caller and Town Hall and Michael Savage and so many others.
[00:41:56.033 --> 00:42:01.557]  They can't get over the fact that there's competition in the marketplace and that smart voters, smart viewers,
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:13.301]  And that's why they're trying to shut us down.
[00:42:13.301 --> 00:42:14.581]  It's why they're coming after us.
[00:42:14.581 --> 00:42:16.122]  It's why they're doing all this.
[00:42:16.122 --> 00:42:19.624]  Because they understand we really do have more viewers than CNN.
[00:42:19.624 --> 00:42:21.184]  We really do reach more people.
[00:42:21.184 --> 00:42:26.287]  I mean, CNN is on every airport, they force feed it in college, in public school, but that's it!
[00:42:26.287 --> 00:42:29.228]  Just like Bill Nye, the anti-science guy.
[00:42:31.903 --> 00:42:32.824]  Exactly right.
[00:42:32.824 --> 00:42:37.129]  So, I mean, look, I love Pat Buchanan, and we go way back to the Nixon days.
[00:42:37.129 --> 00:42:40.072]  I think he's a true patriot.
[00:42:40.072 --> 00:42:41.213]  And he's absolutely right.
[00:42:41.213 --> 00:42:42.495]  There's an arrogance
[00:42:43.405 --> 00:42:47.168]  They couldn't beat Nixon at the ballot box, so they took him down.
[00:42:47.168 --> 00:42:51.030]  They couldn't beat Trump, now they're going to try to take him down.
[00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:57.715]  This whole whipping up hysteria because he doesn't fit their model of what a president should be.
[00:42:57.715 --> 00:42:59.376]  Trump is crazy?
[00:42:59.376 --> 00:43:02.518]  We had a pervert as president.
[00:43:02.518 --> 00:43:09.523]  We had a serial sex criminal as president of the United States, but nobody decided he was crazy.
[00:43:10.906 --> 00:43:22.171]  The 97% of the Haitian money who's committed so many crimes, Chinese communist agents, gave them the missile secrets, thousands of times that they could ever even claim that Trump's done with no evidence.
[00:43:22.171 --> 00:43:29.595]  And that's what's crazy is everybody who has any memory or historical context knows it's the Democrats that have been in bed with the Russians.
[00:43:29.835 --> 00:43:31.476]  The Republicans never have been.
[00:43:31.476 --> 00:43:34.417]  It's you that helped round up in the 80s Russian spies.
[00:43:34.417 --> 00:43:44.122]  It's Roy Cohn of the Un-American Activities Committee that Donald Trump basically got, you know, tootled by.
[00:43:44.122 --> 00:43:51.526]  All this is going on, and they know that's the reality, and they knew that Trump was planning to go after them for their China connections.
[00:43:52.026 --> 00:43:53.006]  And so what did they do?
[00:43:53.006 --> 00:43:53.987]  They threw it back at him.
[00:43:53.987 --> 00:43:58.148]  And I think he knows the only thing he can do to defeat them is go on the offense.
[00:43:58.148 --> 00:44:02.509]  And I hope we get a new FBI director and any other tidbits on Sessions.
[00:44:02.509 --> 00:44:04.129]  Because I know he's a hard charger.
[00:44:04.129 --> 00:44:05.250]  He wants justice.
[00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:09.111]  I mean, if they want a Russia investigation and a China investigation, shouldn't we give them one?
[00:44:10.393 --> 00:44:20.937]  Yeah, I think the Attorney General should impanel a grand jury and pull Susan Rice in, pull Valerie Jarrett in, pull this fellow Rhodes in, bury himself.
[00:44:20.937 --> 00:44:33.122]  I want to find out what Obama knew and when he knew it regarding the unmasking of surveillance data and what he knew about surveillance at Trump Tower under oath.
[00:44:34.048 --> 00:44:53.454]  Just like they want me to testify for the House and Senate Intelligence Committee, at least they say they do, I'm not sure I believe it, I think it's time to expand the investigation of those two committees to include Democratic malfeasance and the misuse of the spy network paid for by the taxpayers.
[00:44:53.454 --> 00:45:01.557]  This guy McCabe, the number two guy at the FBI, he wanted to use taxpayer money to pay for the phony dossier
[00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:09.633]  That smeared Donald Trump as having had, you know, watched a bunch of prostitutes in Florida in his hotel suite.
[00:45:09.633 --> 00:45:10.813]  A total fraud.
[00:45:10.813 --> 00:45:12.033]  Never happened.
[00:45:12.033 --> 00:45:13.834]  Not even a chance that it happened.
[00:45:13.834 --> 00:45:15.075]  Oh, let me tell you about BuzzFeed.
[00:45:15.075 --> 00:45:17.936]  Let me tell you about BuzzFeed that made up the WeeWeeGate thing.
[00:45:17.936 --> 00:45:18.896]  It was totally made up.
[00:45:18.896 --> 00:45:19.476]  They admit it was made up.
[00:45:19.476 --> 00:45:20.456]  They're being sued over.
[00:45:20.456 --> 00:45:23.918]  They literally had a guy following around for months and you read the article.
[00:45:25.058 --> 00:45:32.422]  Half of it's total fiction has no, just totally made up and the rest is like twisted made up garbage.
[00:45:32.422 --> 00:45:36.103]  I mean the most crazy made up insane trash.
[00:45:36.103 --> 00:45:37.004]  And that's who these people are.
[00:45:37.004 --> 00:45:40.025]  They're fiction writers claiming we're fiction writers, Roger.
[00:45:40.025 --> 00:45:47.068]  No, I saw the BuzzFeed publisher, editor Ben Smith on TV last week.
[00:45:47.068 --> 00:45:49.029]  I think he's in a weight gaining contest.
[00:45:49.029 --> 00:45:50.170]  Looks to me like he's winning.
[00:45:51.551 --> 00:45:55.894]  This is the day that Hindenburg went down and it reminded me of that.
[00:45:55.894 --> 00:45:58.296]  I don't know what Ben is eating, but there's a lot of it.
[00:46:00.109 --> 00:46:01.750]  Hey, I look forward to seeing you this Sunday.
[00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:04.312]  I'm sure you'll be back on all these developments that are happening.
[00:46:04.312 --> 00:46:12.079]  And I look forward to working with you a lot closer as we defend the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, and as we remove the globalist cancer that's trying to hijack the country.
[00:46:12.079 --> 00:46:14.040]  Roger, thank you so much.
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:24.348]  As we let you go, I'll obviously call you tonight, but I'm going to play the trailer for your new amazing Netflix series that premieres Friday, Get Me Roger Stone.
[00:46:24.348 --> 00:46:27.231]  Here is that trailer, Get Me Roger Stone.
[00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:31.032]  He loves the game, he has fun with it, and he's very good at it.
[00:46:31.032 --> 00:46:35.154]  I'm an agent provocateur.
[00:46:35.154 --> 00:46:36.475]  Political strategist.
[00:46:36.475 --> 00:46:38.676]  Controversial as you can get.
[00:46:38.676 --> 00:46:40.957]  An incredible capacity for treachery.
[00:46:40.957 --> 00:46:42.858]  Win-at-all-cost mentality.
[00:46:42.858 --> 00:46:47.281]  When people think of Washington corruption, they think of Roger Stone.
[00:46:47.281 --> 00:46:51.803]  Those who say I have no soul, those who say I have no principles, are losers.
[00:46:51.803 --> 00:46:53.064]  Those are bitter losers.
[00:46:54.355 --> 00:46:57.039]  There's really nobody quite like Roger Stone.
[00:46:57.039 --> 00:47:01.826]  The Nixon tattoo is really all you need to know about Roger.
[00:47:01.826 --> 00:47:04.951]  We really pioneered negative campaign advertising.
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:09.962]  He created the modern sleazeball lobbyist.
[00:47:09.962 --> 00:47:12.103]  Washington's been worse for it ever since.
[00:47:12.103 --> 00:47:13.003]  Stones rule.
[00:47:13.003 --> 00:47:16.685]  It is better to be infamous than never be famous at all.
[00:47:16.685 --> 00:47:18.385]  A swinger scandal happened.
[00:47:18.385 --> 00:47:20.766]  My private life is nobody's business.
[00:47:20.766 --> 00:47:22.547]  Got chased out of Washington.
[00:47:22.547 --> 00:47:25.908]  He's looking to see if he can find an angle.
[00:47:25.908 --> 00:47:27.629]  I was like a jockey looking for a horse.
[00:47:27.629 --> 00:47:29.350]  You can't win the race if you don't have a horse.
[00:47:37.742 --> 00:47:38.062]  All right, folks.
[00:47:38.062 --> 00:47:41.563]  Again, this is pure bull.
[00:47:41.563 --> 00:47:45.244]  Roger saw something that nobody else saw back in the early 80s.
[00:47:45.244 --> 00:47:49.106]  I suggested that Trump should explore a bid for the presidency.
[00:47:49.106 --> 00:47:54.027]  He created Donald Trump as a political figure.
[00:47:54.027 --> 00:47:54.988]  What have I lied about?
[00:47:54.988 --> 00:47:56.948]  Have you spoken with the WikiLeaks founder?
[00:47:56.948 --> 00:47:57.929]  You're a rape denier.
[00:47:57.929 --> 00:47:59.269]  Roger, you can't just say that.
[00:47:59.269 --> 00:48:01.490]  You have to be outrageous to get noticed.
[00:48:03.769 --> 00:48:13.797]  America may be collapsing, but Roger Stone is determined to reject it.
[00:48:13.797 --> 00:48:22.824]  I revel in your hatred, because if I weren't effective, you wouldn't hate me.
[00:48:22.824 --> 00:48:23.745]  Oh my gosh.
[00:48:23.745 --> 00:48:24.566]  Let me tell you something.
[00:48:24.566 --> 00:48:27.448]  Roger Stone has never told me anything that wasn't true.
[00:48:29.304 --> 00:48:36.632]  And he has been so careful that we never put out any disinformation, because being truthful is the most valuable thing we do.
[00:48:36.632 --> 00:48:40.476]  And you can look at what we've done, and it's like 99% accurate.
[00:48:40.476 --> 00:48:45.621]  When I make a mistake, I come out and I say it.
[00:48:45.621 --> 00:48:48.284]  And I'm not gonna even get into the behind-the-scenes baseball, but...
[00:48:50.441 --> 00:48:54.384]  You know, he tells me such and such is going to call you, boom, that person calls me in an hour.
[00:48:54.384 --> 00:48:56.826]  Or he tells me this is about to happen, it happens.
[00:48:56.826 --> 00:49:03.331]  He has not told me one thing that didn't turn out to be accurate.
[00:49:03.331 --> 00:49:06.894]  One thing.
[00:49:06.894 --> 00:49:08.976]  And that's it.
[00:49:08.976 --> 00:49:12.659]  And so, that's why they demonize him and why they hate him so much.
[00:49:12.659 --> 00:49:15.821]  And then he does wear the fancy suits and just rub it in their face.
[00:49:15.821 --> 00:49:20.045]  Because he knows what a bunch of arrogant scum they are and he does it to be arrogant back at them.
[00:49:21.502 --> 00:49:25.744]  And again, I met Roger like five years ago at a JFK event.
[00:49:25.744 --> 00:49:29.786]  He's written a bunch of best-selling books on JFK and the assassination.
[00:49:29.786 --> 00:49:33.027]  And I was like, okay, yeah, Roger Stone, political co-guy, okay, I know who he is.
[00:49:33.027 --> 00:49:34.628]  And then I got to know him a couple years ago.
[00:49:34.628 --> 00:49:38.289]  He's just a really smart guy.
[00:49:38.289 --> 00:49:44.112]  And the media just sits there and demonizes and demonizes and demonizes and demonizes and demonizes and demonizes.
[00:49:44.112 --> 00:49:44.892]  But it's good.
[00:49:44.892 --> 00:49:46.053]  They're a bunch of scum.
[00:49:46.053 --> 00:49:49.114]  And they don't like Roger Stone, but he's not a pedophile.
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:51.480]  That's his big thing.
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:53.081]  You know, he doesn't like guys or kids.
[00:49:53.081 --> 00:49:59.022]  And so, you know, to the liberal elite stuff, that's kind of like a bad thing.
[00:49:59.022 --> 00:50:01.423]  Being a pedophile or a pervert's a good thing.
[00:50:01.423 --> 00:50:04.223]  If you're not, well, you like women, that's kind of another crime.
[00:50:04.223 --> 00:50:07.704]  Now, let's continue here, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:50:40.457 --> 00:50:42.639]  They like soda, and they like to taste it.
[00:50:42.639 --> 00:50:44.040]  They go, no, you're not getting soda.
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:44.801]  You're not getting that.
[00:50:44.801 --> 00:50:45.542]  But you can do this.
[00:50:45.542 --> 00:50:47.543]  And they drink it, and they're so much healthier.

[00:54:05.239 --> 00:54:11.443]  Alright, during the break, we got contacted by another contact in the White House.
[00:54:11.443 --> 00:54:12.664]  Pretty high up.
[00:54:12.664 --> 00:54:16.486]  And they said, look, Sean Spicer has not been fired.
[00:54:16.486 --> 00:54:20.289]  Well, we're not saying Sean Spicer's fired.
[00:54:20.289 --> 00:54:24.392]  What we're saying is, is that the word is, he's going to be fired.
[00:54:25.455 --> 00:54:30.479]  White House sources, Spicer out as Trump begins purge of establishment advisors.
[00:54:30.479 --> 00:54:33.522]  Again, I gave Paul all the info and the sources this morning.
[00:54:33.522 --> 00:54:34.783]  He wrote the article.
[00:54:34.783 --> 00:54:37.745]  I can see how you could argue that's not accurate.
[00:54:37.745 --> 00:54:44.491]  White House sources, Spicer soon to be out.
[00:54:44.491 --> 00:54:47.814]  Or being prepared to be moved out?
[00:54:47.814 --> 00:54:51.057]  Because I can see how they contacted us and said, he's not fired.
[00:54:53.067 --> 00:54:59.634]  I'm not knocking Paul, I'm just being contacted by the White House.
[00:54:59.634 --> 00:55:05.340]  White House sources Trump looking to replace Spicer?
[00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:06.261]  That's it.
[00:55:06.261 --> 00:55:10.386]  White House sources Trump looking for Spicer's replacement.
[00:55:14.724 --> 00:55:16.124]  That's what, we need to change that.
[00:55:16.124 --> 00:55:25.028]  Because you know, we put stuff out fast and I can see, the article clearly says he's not out yet, he hasn't been fired yet, but then we're in contact saying he's not out, he's not fired.
[00:55:25.028 --> 00:55:26.828]  No, we understand he's not fired yet.
[00:55:26.828 --> 00:55:41.813]  The article goes on to say, White House sources tell InfoWars that Sean Spicer is set, set, set, so that's correct, see, to be fired as President Trump begins a purge of establishment advisors who he feels have failed to properly investigate leaks coming from within the administration.
[00:55:41.813 --> 00:55:43.334]  And listen, Trump changes his mind!
[00:55:44.175 --> 00:55:47.376]  So that's why we probably... I'm not knocking Paul, he's doing a great job.
[00:55:47.376 --> 00:55:48.757]  We probably should clarify the headlines.
[00:55:48.757 --> 00:55:50.458]  Let's see what the White House is saying.
[00:55:50.458 --> 00:55:52.239]  This isn't my other sources.
[00:55:52.239 --> 00:55:54.419]  This is another source.
[00:55:54.419 --> 00:55:56.180]  But it's high level.
[00:55:56.180 --> 00:55:58.421]  And they would know.
[00:55:58.421 --> 00:55:59.182]  So I want to be clear.
[00:55:59.182 --> 00:56:00.682]  Spicer is not out.
[00:56:00.682 --> 00:56:01.683]  The media will have his headlines.
[00:56:01.683 --> 00:56:03.323]  Jones did fake news.
[00:56:03.323 --> 00:56:05.444]  Said Spicer was out, but he's still there.
[00:56:05.444 --> 00:56:07.565]  We're saying Trump's looking for his replacement.
[00:56:07.565 --> 00:56:08.746]  That's what the article says.
[00:56:08.746 --> 00:56:11.667]  But I can see how the headlines should probably be a little bit clearer.
[00:56:11.667 --> 00:56:13.488]  When we're wrong, we will change something.
[00:56:14.201 --> 00:56:16.163]  So just call Paul.
[00:56:16.163 --> 00:56:16.864]  Just explain it to him.
[00:56:16.864 --> 00:56:18.686]  I'm sure he gets it.
[00:56:18.686 --> 00:56:19.767]  White House sources.
[00:56:19.767 --> 00:56:27.716]  Trump looking for Spicer's replacement as purge of establishment advisors begins.
[00:56:27.716 --> 00:56:28.778]  That's the headline.
[00:56:28.778 --> 00:56:30.960]  So we just have somebody in there change it.
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:33.243]  White House sources.
[00:56:33.243 --> 00:56:35.085]  Trump looking for Spicer's replacement
[00:56:37.288 --> 00:56:40.611]  As Purge of Establishment Advisors begins.
[00:56:40.611 --> 00:56:41.571]  That's your headline.
[00:56:41.571 --> 00:56:42.372]  That's accurate.
[00:56:42.372 --> 00:56:43.273]  And the sub-headline, too.
[00:56:43.273 --> 00:56:49.477]  Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle is being looked at as the new press secretary.
[00:56:49.477 --> 00:56:53.940]  And it says that in the body of the article, but I'll make all that clear.
[00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:59.544]  It's crazy how he put this stuff out like 30 minutes ago at the White House directly calling us saying, uh, he's not fired, Alex.
[00:56:59.544 --> 00:57:01.086]  What are you doing?
[00:57:01.086 --> 00:57:05.609]  Well, that's not what the article says, but I can see why they've got an issue.
[00:57:05.609 --> 00:57:06.530]  But it's real sources.
[00:57:07.446 --> 00:57:14.098]  The one correcting us is Real Sports 2 in live time.
[00:57:14.098 --> 00:57:16.482]  If we do do one thing, it's that we hurry around here.
[00:57:17.216 --> 00:57:19.297]  Because that's what you gotta do in a newsroom.
[00:57:19.297 --> 00:57:20.217]  With limited people.
[00:57:20.217 --> 00:57:22.658]  That's why I need to hire more investigative journalists.
[00:57:22.658 --> 00:57:24.398]  Because Paul is like an octopus.
[00:57:24.398 --> 00:57:28.760]  He's got his arms just shooting around, trying to run all these things, dominate Twitter, everything else.
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:30.700]  He's got me sending him transcripts of what to write.
[00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:35.262]  And you know, I get one thing wrong and it turns into this big snowball.
[00:57:35.262 --> 00:57:36.942]  And so that's kind of how these things work.
[00:57:36.942 --> 00:57:40.544]  But the point is, he just got rid of Comey.
[00:57:40.544 --> 00:57:42.644]  And Spicer's not even up there right now.
[00:57:42.644 --> 00:57:44.965]  And they are looking for his replacement.
[00:57:46.552 --> 00:57:52.355]  And the President is PO'd at Priebus, who fought with him over getting rid of Comey.
[00:57:52.355 --> 00:57:56.918]  And that comes from high level in the White House.
[00:57:56.918 --> 00:57:58.159]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:57:58.159 --> 00:57:59.920]  And the other big news, shock!
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:06.183]  Acting FBI Director, a Clinton ally, and it goes to all the $600,000 the wife gave to Hillary, and just all of it.
[00:58:06.183 --> 00:58:07.604]  I mean, talk about politicos.
[00:58:09.574 --> 00:58:13.840]  And now when they get rid of this guy, obviously because he's just the interim, they're going to say that's a big conspiracy.
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:15.503]  No, they're looking for a new director.
[00:58:15.503 --> 00:58:17.586]  He's the interim.
[00:58:17.586 --> 00:58:18.367]  Info Wars!
[00:58:19.702 --> 00:58:23.085]  Store.com, ladies and gentlemen, we have the Vitamin Mineral Fusion back in.

[00:58:45.482 --> 00:58:48.224]  Something huge that I'm going to cover when we come right back.
[00:58:48.224 --> 00:58:48.585]  Stay with us.

[01:00:19.996 --> 01:00:25.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:34.386]  As Trump attempts to rebuild America and get our jobs back, the globalists are claiming that America is collapsing because of him.
[01:00:34.386 --> 01:00:36.708]  Just in that last trailer I played for Get Me Roger Stone,
[01:00:38.217 --> 01:00:41.698]  Total and complete baloney town.
[01:00:41.698 --> 01:00:47.761]  But we've got Michael Schneider on the state of the economy, what's happening in Baltimore and other areas, Chicago, joining us.
[01:00:47.761 --> 01:01:05.408]  And I want to get Dr. Jerome Corsi on, because we exclusively, three months ago, and then again two months ago, and then a month ago, and then last week, broke that $300 billion and growing
[01:01:06.465 --> 01:01:20.850]  First it was 200-something, then 300-something, had been looted by Obama, had a Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and that Trump is trying to get that stopped right now, and that's one reason they're trying to remove him from office.
[01:01:20.850 --> 01:01:27.413]  And that they're putting it into Obamacare and giving it to these big insurance companies and offshore banks, part of this looting.
[01:01:27.413 --> 01:01:32.595]  Now, we got that from the White House, and we got that from Congress, because I know Corsi's sources.
[01:01:34.548 --> 01:01:35.608]  He's setting up our D.C.
[01:01:35.608 --> 01:01:36.009]  Bureau.
[01:01:36.009 --> 01:01:38.190]  He's there now.
[01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:42.291]  He's joining us at 1.30 today, so in about an hour and a half.
[01:01:42.291 --> 01:01:43.152]  Trump admin!
[01:01:43.152 --> 01:01:46.773]  We intend to stop Obamacare looting scheme.
[01:01:46.773 --> 01:01:54.117]  So I said a few weeks ago when this all broke and when Mnuchin, the head of the Treasury Department, came out and said on Fox Business, you know, they have been looting it.
[01:01:54.117 --> 01:01:56.157]  And we are looking at that right now.
[01:01:56.157 --> 01:01:59.419]  Well, now the word is they intend to stop it.
[01:01:59.419 --> 01:02:01.360]  That's exactly what Corsi's been telling the White House.
[01:02:02.267 --> 01:02:11.910]  Of course, they've been telling him he's got a degree in all this finance from Harvard, former advisor to Trump, that just don't let them loot Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and it's over.
[01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:12.630]  It's over.
[01:02:12.630 --> 01:02:15.751]  People say, oh, we need free health care for everybody.
[01:02:15.751 --> 01:02:18.652]  This country had free health care by the 70s.
[01:02:18.652 --> 01:02:21.433]  Most doctors spent a third of their time at charity hospitals.
[01:02:21.433 --> 01:02:27.695]  My dad used to spend a third of his time at charity hospitals rewiring jaws as an oral surgeon and doing charity work.
[01:02:29.383 --> 01:02:33.104]  Suddenly though, there were lines out the building because nobody else was doing their job and doing it.
[01:02:33.104 --> 01:02:36.165]  Ron Paul used to give a third of his time delivering babies for free.
[01:02:36.165 --> 01:02:39.126]  Working for $2 a day.
[01:02:39.126 --> 01:02:40.987]  He'd go two days a week and do that.
[01:02:40.987 --> 01:02:43.868]  The poorest hospitals in Houston.
[01:02:43.868 --> 01:02:46.309]  Because the Hippocratic Oath says you're a servant.
[01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:47.309]  Hippocrates.
[01:02:47.309 --> 01:02:49.390]  It's an ancient priesthood.
[01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:51.631]  People think, oh my gosh, the Masons and all this stuff.
[01:02:51.631 --> 01:02:54.932]  It's Illuminati and the symbol of medicine is two snakes wrapped together.
[01:02:54.932 --> 01:02:57.053]  Yeah, DNA and it's a cult.
[01:02:57.053 --> 01:02:58.053]  Of course it's a cult!
[01:03:00.103 --> 01:03:04.745]  Medicine's facilities were temples!
[01:03:04.745 --> 01:03:19.010]  And you had temples of prostitution, temples of medicine, temples, and then you had secret societies of mathematics and architecture, and so it all comes out of the ancient times.
[01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:20.811]  But they've gotten rid of the good parts of it.
[01:03:20.811 --> 01:03:22.951]  They don't have the Hippocratic Oath anywhere in the world now.
[01:03:22.951 --> 01:03:25.953]  It's been gone for about 15 years.
[01:03:25.953 --> 01:03:26.993]  Do no harm, it's gone.
[01:03:28.882 --> 01:03:32.865]  And they sit up there and you see ignorant people on TV going, my son has a birth defect!
[01:03:32.865 --> 01:03:34.366]  What if I wasn't rich?
[01:03:34.366 --> 01:03:37.027]  What would happen?
[01:03:37.027 --> 01:03:38.628]  That's why the hospitals are called St.
[01:03:38.628 --> 01:03:39.429]  David's or St.
[01:03:39.429 --> 01:03:40.229]  Michael's or St.
[01:03:40.229 --> 01:03:40.630]  this, St.
[01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:41.070]  that.
[01:03:41.070 --> 01:03:43.512]  Most hospitals are tax-exempt.
[01:03:43.512 --> 01:03:47.975]  But they're owned by big, profitable conglomerates.
[01:03:47.975 --> 01:03:51.777]  And they're the ones lobbying for more Obamacare, more big government.
[01:03:51.777 --> 01:03:56.180]  And the more money you throw at it, just like education, the more expensive it's going to get.
[01:03:59.329 --> 01:04:02.451]  Trump admin, we intend to stop Obamacare looting scheme.
[01:04:02.451 --> 01:04:06.133]  Fannie, Freddie, looted by Obama era policies to pay for Obamacare.
[01:04:06.133 --> 01:04:09.595]  Here's the quiet satisfaction I have.
[01:04:09.595 --> 01:04:13.217]  These articles that Corsi puts out maybe get 300 comments.
[01:04:13.217 --> 01:04:20.061]  Other stories we get, you know, the UT black professor saying kill the white people, that gets like 5,000 comments and it's read by a million people.
[01:04:20.061 --> 01:04:25.043]  But okay, let's say Corsi's articles most of them only get read by maybe 20,000 people.
[01:04:25.043 --> 01:04:25.644]  You know who reads them?
[01:04:28.837 --> 01:04:29.983]  The White House?
[01:04:29.983 --> 01:04:30.807]  Congress?
[01:04:30.807 --> 01:04:31.511]  The regulators?
[01:04:32.418 --> 01:04:33.838]  And that's why they want to shut us down.
[01:04:33.838 --> 01:04:39.520]  They've told me directly, if I don't want to be sued, if I don't want to be attacked, if I don't want to be, you name it, stop reporting on this.
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:42.841]  And guess what I'm going to say to the big bank and the Newark Federal Reserve and everybody else?
[01:04:42.841 --> 01:04:43.981]  Here's what I have to say to them.
[01:04:43.981 --> 01:04:44.442]  Hey, you ready?
[01:04:44.442 --> 01:04:46.782]  This is what I'm saying to you right now.
[01:04:46.782 --> 01:04:48.223]  You got that message?
[01:04:48.223 --> 01:04:49.183]  Never going to stop.
[01:04:49.183 --> 01:04:51.324]  Never going to stop going to beat you too.
[01:04:51.324 --> 01:04:53.344]  Even if you kill me, I become a martyr.
[01:04:53.344 --> 01:04:54.605]  That's what I say to you.
[01:04:54.605 --> 01:04:55.345]  Got it?
[01:04:55.345 --> 01:04:56.605]  Never going to stop.
[01:04:56.605 --> 01:04:57.365]  Full sail.
[01:04:57.365 --> 01:04:58.286]  Full steam.
[01:04:58.286 --> 01:04:58.886]  Rounding speed.
[01:05:00.874 --> 01:05:05.659]  Last week, a study was released showing the differences between vaccinated kids and non-vaccinated kids.
[01:05:05.659 --> 01:05:11.164]  Infowars.com covered this, pointing out the pushback of these studies being censored, while more pushback has begun.
[01:05:11.164 --> 01:05:18.691]  The Boston Herald published an editorial from the entire editorial staff, which is now calling for anyone pushing anti-vaccine rhetoric to be hung.
[01:05:18.691 --> 01:05:25.298]  The well-written legal speak quote is, lying to vulnerable people about the health and safety of their children ought to be a hanging offense.
[01:05:25.498 --> 01:05:31.560]  This after insinuating that anti-vaccine people are responsible for a measles outbreak in a Somali community in Minnesota.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:37.302]  This story claims as fact vaccines don't cause autism when some have it already listed as a side effect.
[01:05:37.302 --> 01:05:41.743]  Of course the irony of their statement regarding hanging people who lie about the health and safety of children
[01:05:42.003 --> 01:05:50.670]  Is it ultimately would fall back on them if they do indeed promote the idea that vaccines cannot be linked to autism, a blatant lie about the health and safety of children.
[01:05:50.670 --> 01:05:58.115]  My guess is this same editorial staff would support abortion, but somehow they don't believe that is a threat to the lives and safety of children.
[01:05:58.115 --> 01:06:00.397]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[01:06:00.997 --> 01:06:02.839]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[01:06:02.839 --> 01:06:09.443]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[01:06:09.443 --> 01:06:12.605]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslive.com.
[01:06:12.605 --> 01:06:22.392]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[01:06:22.392 --> 01:06:23.233]  Caveman.
[01:06:23.233 --> 01:06:28.296]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[01:06:28.296 --> 01:06:30.418]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[01:06:30.698 --> 01:06:33.859]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[01:06:33.859 --> 01:06:39.001]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[01:06:39.001 --> 01:06:47.064]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[01:06:47.064 --> 01:06:55.067]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[01:06:55.067 --> 01:06:59.729]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself in 4WarsLive.com today.
[01:07:00.862 --> 01:07:03.163]  Electrify your day with Secret 12.
[01:07:03.163 --> 01:07:04.724]  It's like lightning in a bottle.

[01:07:16.569 --> 01:07:21.531]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[01:07:21.531 --> 01:07:26.993]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.

[01:07:35.119 --> 01:07:39.843]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[01:07:39.843 --> 01:07:45.707]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes.
[01:07:45.707 --> 01:07:48.869]  But it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[01:07:48.869 --> 01:07:52.112]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.
[01:07:52.412 --> 01:07:56.307]  Experience the power of Secret 12 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:07:56.307 --> 01:07:57.933]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:08:05.444 --> 01:08:09.546]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:08:09.546 --> 01:08:12.367]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:08:12.367 --> 01:08:15.449]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:08:15.449 --> 01:08:18.931]  Run on for a long time.
[01:08:18.931 --> 01:08:21.812]  Run on for a long time.
[01:08:21.812 --> 01:08:24.773]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[01:08:24.773 --> 01:08:27.195]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[01:08:29.415 --> 01:08:32.319]  Go tell that long-tongue liar.
[01:08:32.319 --> 01:08:35.204]  Go and tell that midnight rider.
[01:08:35.204 --> 01:08:38.689]  Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back-biter.
[01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:41.453]  Tell him that God's gonna cut him down.
[01:08:41.453 --> 01:08:44.097]  Tell him that God's gonna cut him down.
[01:08:46.764 --> 01:08:52.588]  Michael Schneider is an investigative journalist, educator, the EconomicCollapseBlog.com.
[01:08:52.588 --> 01:09:01.514]  He's the author of two books as well, and I hope to, in the future, get him tied into some roundtable broadcasts we're going to launch on radio and TV here in just the next few months.
[01:09:01.514 --> 01:09:04.616]  We are busy little bees, busy little beavers here.
[01:09:04.616 --> 01:09:07.678]  Now he's got some breaking exclusive political developments.
[01:09:07.678 --> 01:09:16.524]  He's got a lot of sources as well, because we are the new media, and the old media can't be trusted, so we get the sources from the FBI, the White House, the Defense Department, you name it.
[01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:26.807]  Like Trump administration, we intend to stop Obamacare looting scheme months after Dr. Jerome Corsi first broke it with the Congress and White House giving him the documents.
[01:09:28.328 --> 01:09:34.350]  From federal lawsuits exposing all this, we've now learned $300 billion was stolen by Obama.
[01:09:34.350 --> 01:09:36.531]  From Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to probably Obamacare.
[01:09:36.531 --> 01:09:38.292]  If Trump simply ends that, it falls.
[01:09:38.292 --> 01:09:43.134]  That's now breaking that Trump... I asked last week, I said, it's still continuing?
[01:09:43.134 --> 01:09:44.254]  What is Trump gonna do?
[01:09:44.254 --> 01:09:45.995]  Why'd the White House tell us about this?
[01:09:45.995 --> 01:09:47.936]  So we can expose it if it's still going on.
[01:09:47.936 --> 01:09:50.617]  Is this the type of unbelievable corruption we've got?
[01:09:50.617 --> 01:09:52.398]  That Trump can't even stop it?
[01:09:52.398 --> 01:09:54.719]  And indeed, that's the case.
[01:09:54.719 --> 01:09:55.759]  So Trump's trying to stop it.
[01:09:55.759 --> 01:09:57.180]  That article's on Infowars.com.
[01:09:59.184 --> 01:10:02.966]  Again, these stories don't go viral, but they go viral in the government.
[01:10:02.966 --> 01:10:06.187]  We have a lot of articles that are viral that are the general public.
[01:10:06.187 --> 01:10:11.789]  But we have articles in like this that shake the foundations of Washington, D.C.
[01:10:11.789 --> 01:10:19.733]  And again, Trump is looking for Spicer's replacement right now as the purge of establishment Republicans begins as Trump cleans house.
[01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:25.534]  And Beverly Guilfoyle is being looked at as a possible replacement for Sean Spicer.
[01:10:25.534 --> 01:10:30.537]  That's up on InfoWars.com by Paul Joseph Watson right now.
[01:10:30.537 --> 01:10:32.419]  Now, Spicer's not out yet.
[01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:33.800]  I don't
[01:10:51.992 --> 01:10:53.753]  That doesn't currently happen yet.
[01:10:53.753 --> 01:10:55.935]  You're right, let's fix that headline.
[01:10:55.935 --> 01:10:57.116]  It's a little bit clearer.
[01:10:57.116 --> 01:10:58.817]  But Michael Schneider is our guest.
[01:10:58.817 --> 01:11:00.318]  I wasn't going to get him on about these stories.
[01:11:00.318 --> 01:11:07.002]  Baltimore has become a rotting, decaying war zone as raging opioid epidemic eats away at the city like a cancer.
[01:11:07.002 --> 01:11:14.908]  Thousands flee Chicago, a drug linked to this, for safer areas of the country as America's third largest city becomes a gang-infested wasteland.
[01:11:16.527 --> 01:11:22.030]  And of course the elites are fleeing the Western world and going to Pacific armored redoubts.
[01:11:22.030 --> 01:11:26.972]  Former Reagan administration official is warning of a financial collapse sometime between August and November.
[01:11:26.972 --> 01:11:28.113]  We're going to look at that.
[01:11:28.113 --> 01:11:29.333]  Hope Trump can stave it off.
[01:11:29.333 --> 01:11:31.714]  Ron Paul says his economics are great.
[01:11:31.714 --> 01:11:34.216]  And by the way, he says his stance on Russia is great.
[01:11:34.216 --> 01:11:35.856]  He just hopes we can get some detente here.
[01:11:35.856 --> 01:11:38.818]  But Ron Paul is supporting Trump right now.
[01:11:38.818 --> 01:11:41.559]  That shows you a lot, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:41.559 --> 01:11:43.800]  So read all that at Economic Collapse Blog.com.
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.141]  But with a new exclusive.
[01:11:46.226 --> 01:11:47.907]  Oh, by the way, I meant to get to this earlier.
[01:11:47.907 --> 01:11:48.847]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:11:48.847 --> 01:11:49.867]  I'm glad he wants to cover that as well.
[01:11:49.867 --> 01:11:50.887]  We'll cover it at the bottom of the hour.
[01:11:50.887 --> 01:11:54.188]  So I'm going to try to have our guest with us the whole hour, take some calls.
[01:11:54.188 --> 01:12:01.271]  I need to respond to Zuckerberg and Dwayne Johnson, all these movie stars and politicos wanting to run for office.
[01:12:01.271 --> 01:12:02.471]  They can all do it as U.S.
[01:12:02.471 --> 01:12:03.911]  citizens.
[01:12:03.911 --> 01:12:06.332]  We don't know who The Rock is.
[01:12:06.332 --> 01:12:07.773]  Comes off as a very charming guy.
[01:12:07.773 --> 01:12:08.553]  I like him in movies.
[01:12:09.619 --> 01:12:10.519]  Very likable.
[01:12:10.519 --> 01:12:19.904]  But we know who Zuckerberg is, who thinks you're dumb effers, and who literally works for the Communist Chinese to censor, and who wants to shut down conservatives and libertarians.
[01:12:19.904 --> 01:12:34.210]  How can he, under the Federal Elections Commission, want to shut down the free speech of Infowars, saying that I'm political and can't be politically involved, when clearly I have my First Amendment, journalists have that, but then he, a sworn enemy of free speech, could be able to run for president.
[01:12:34.210 --> 01:12:36.872]  So that's coming up as, well, bottom of the hour.
[01:12:37.532 --> 01:12:40.055]  But right now, let's go to Michael Snyder.
[01:12:40.055 --> 01:12:42.137]  Michael, good to have you with us.
[01:12:42.137 --> 01:12:43.659]  Alex, it's always so good to be with you.
[01:12:43.659 --> 01:12:45.541]  Thank you for having me on the show today.
[01:12:45.541 --> 01:12:45.841]  You bet.
[01:12:45.841 --> 01:12:47.923]  Wow, you say you got some big breaking exclusive news.
[01:12:49.162 --> 01:12:49.482]  I do.
[01:12:49.482 --> 01:12:50.663]  I do, Alex.
[01:12:50.663 --> 01:12:54.407]  And I'm glad you just mentioned all those celebrities that are thinking of running for office.
[01:12:54.407 --> 01:12:55.488]  But you know what?
[01:12:55.488 --> 01:13:00.472]  We need to return to the days when just regular citizens ran for office.
[01:13:00.472 --> 01:13:03.515]  And, you know, we got Donald Trump elected.
[01:13:03.515 --> 01:13:07.458]  We sent him to Washington, but now he's under constant warfare because he doesn't have many friends.
[01:13:07.458 --> 01:13:09.500]  He doesn't have many friends in Congress.
[01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:11.702]  So we need to take Congress back.
[01:13:11.702 --> 01:13:13.784]  We need to take the entire government back.
[01:13:14.364 --> 01:13:22.346]  And so people out there, your listeners, people that, you know, are part of this movement, when the opportunity arises, they need to take action.
[01:13:22.346 --> 01:13:34.688]  So this week, two days ago, we learned here in Idaho that Raul Labrador, the congressman who represents the first district here in Idaho, he says he's stepping down.
[01:13:34.688 --> 01:13:39.869]  He's not going to run for another term because he's going to run for governor here in Idaho.
[01:13:39.869 --> 01:13:42.630]  Now that's the district where I live.
[01:13:44.093 --> 01:13:45.954]  You're in Idaho.
[01:13:45.954 --> 01:13:55.496]  And so after talking about it with my wife and thinking about, hey, we need people like Ron Paul back in the House of Representatives.
[01:13:55.496 --> 01:14:02.618]  We need people who carry on that legacy of freedom and liberty and restoring the U.S.
[01:14:02.618 --> 01:14:03.758]  Constitution.
[01:14:03.758 --> 01:14:05.539]  We need some friends for Donald Trump.
[01:14:06.377 --> 01:14:09.279]  In Congress, to represent the people.
[01:14:09.279 --> 01:14:14.281]  We could use some info warriors actually in there, embedded in the government.
[01:14:14.281 --> 01:14:29.709]  And so, talking it over with my wife, I am very strongly considering, and this is the world exclusive, I'm announcing this for the first time, I am very strongly considering running for that open house seat that Raul Labrador is vacating.
[01:14:29.709 --> 01:14:32.811]  So I am very strongly considering running for Congress, Alex.
[01:14:33.541 --> 01:14:34.341]  Well, that's exciting.
[01:14:34.341 --> 01:14:36.162]  You reach millions of people a week.
[01:14:36.162 --> 01:14:38.423]  Your stories are featured all over the news.
[01:14:38.423 --> 01:14:39.984]  You do hard-hitting stuff.
[01:14:39.984 --> 01:14:41.945]  You're an educator, a parent, an author.
[01:14:41.945 --> 01:14:44.646]  And even if you don't win, you'll inject real issues into the campaign.
[01:14:44.646 --> 01:14:56.192]  But if enough people like you run, we'll start getting people that aren't just lawyers, but are actually investigative journalists, educators, authors like yourself, doctors, scientists, police officers, veterans, you name it.
[01:14:56.192 --> 01:14:57.513]  That's what we need.
[01:14:57.513 --> 01:14:57.993]  Farmers,
[01:14:59.233 --> 01:15:01.055]  Engineers, we need to do that.
[01:15:01.055 --> 01:15:02.155]  So that's very, very exciting.
[01:15:02.155 --> 01:15:05.237]  I was just talking about, I didn't even know you were going to make this announcement.
[01:15:05.237 --> 01:15:06.018]  I knew something was coming.
[01:15:06.903 --> 01:15:08.464]  That we all need to get involved.
[01:15:08.464 --> 01:15:11.625]  We have these elites coming with all their money and all their control.
[01:15:11.625 --> 01:15:16.627]  And watch, they'll probably tell you, you can't write on your own website or you can't have your own TV show or radio show.
[01:15:16.627 --> 01:15:22.369]  But then Mark Zuckerberg and others, they can all, or Bloomberg can run for governor while he has his own media empire.
[01:15:22.369 --> 01:15:26.671]  No, we should all be able to have our own media, our own systems, and be involved in the press.
[01:15:26.671 --> 01:15:30.653]  We had that until the 70s, with all these federal rules and stuff.
[01:15:30.653 --> 01:15:32.614]  Now they're trying to use the Federal Elections Commission to say,
[01:15:33.434 --> 01:15:37.138]  We can shut down Drudge Report because he has political views and he's the press.
[01:15:37.138 --> 01:15:44.686]  Well of course he should be able to counter the mainstream media and all this garbage that piles onto patriots and piles onto Trump.
[01:15:44.686 --> 01:15:47.169]  So I'm very very excited about this and I hope you do run for Congress.
[01:15:48.519 --> 01:15:50.861]  Yeah, there is a war on the alternative media.
[01:15:50.861 --> 01:15:57.425]  They're trying to shut down alternative voices, take away their advertising, ban them from Google.
[01:15:57.425 --> 01:16:03.369]  And so why don't we declare war back and say, hey, we're going to take Congress.
[01:16:03.369 --> 01:16:17.538]  And my hope is that if I step forward and do this, that other people, other info warriors, people that listen to the broadcast, people that are patriotic, just ordinary citizens will rise up and say, hey, if Donald Trump can do this, maybe I can do this too.
[01:16:18.439 --> 01:16:21.201]  And let's be clear, we're riding a wave.
[01:16:21.201 --> 01:16:24.302]  The Freedom Caucus is doing a great job, even better than Trump.
[01:16:24.302 --> 01:16:25.503]  We've got to expand that.
[01:16:25.503 --> 01:16:31.186]  We've got to have an absolute move to block everything the globals are trying to do and put forward our mission.
[01:16:31.186 --> 01:16:34.208]  And if enough people run, some will win.
[01:16:34.208 --> 01:16:40.532]  So everybody who are patriots have got to run because then you're in the town halls, then you're on TV, then you're on the talk radio.
[01:16:40.532 --> 01:16:41.953]  It gives you a way
[01:16:42.952 --> 01:16:48.757]  To promote liberty, to promote your websites, to get a database of patriots that want to work together in your area.
[01:16:48.757 --> 01:16:50.278]  This is how we defeat them.
[01:16:50.278 --> 01:16:52.319]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:16:52.319 --> 01:16:54.901]  Michael Snyder, I sure hope you do it.
[01:16:54.901 --> 01:17:03.608]  Yeah, well I can't formally announce yet because that has certain implications, but let me just say I'm very, very strongly considering doing this.
[01:17:03.608 --> 01:17:11.034]  And I hope many others will join me, because like you said, some of us will win, some of us will lose, but it gives us a platform to get the message out there.
[01:17:11.434 --> 01:17:18.336]  And, you know, we can't just sit back and complain about how bad Congress is and wait for someone else to step up and do it.
[01:17:18.336 --> 01:17:24.817]  You know, I've got a certain amount of name recognition, and then up here in Idaho I live in one of the most conservative areas of the country.
[01:17:24.817 --> 01:17:31.459]  So if I could win the primary, the Republican primary, the general election would very likely very much go in my favor.
[01:17:31.459 --> 01:17:35.080]  And so it's a very favorable environment for me up here.
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:38.921]  But all over the country, not only Congress, but people need to look at
[01:17:39.241 --> 01:17:40.062]  They're local.
[01:17:40.062 --> 01:17:41.444]  They're state houses.
[01:17:41.444 --> 01:17:43.045]  They need to look at local government.
[01:17:43.045 --> 01:17:48.371]  Wherever an opportunity arises, maybe people need to think, well, not wait for someone else to do it.
[01:17:48.371 --> 01:17:49.313]  Maybe I should do it.
[01:17:49.313 --> 01:17:53.858]  Maybe I should step forward and take action and try to take our government back.
[01:17:54.218 --> 01:17:58.161]  Because our government today is not what our founding fathers intended.
[01:17:58.161 --> 01:18:05.908]  Instead, the globalists have turned our constitutional republic into this vicious monster, which is the enemy of the people.
[01:18:05.908 --> 01:18:12.894]  We need to tame that monster and return to the kind of constitutional republic that our founders intended.
[01:18:12.894 --> 01:18:14.115]  I totally agree.
[01:18:14.115 --> 01:18:17.598]  And folks, we're riding a wave of populism, of nationalism.
[01:18:18.729 --> 01:18:25.254]  And some people will win like Brexit, sometimes they'll fail in France, but still a pin one, built her party, got stronger.
[01:18:25.254 --> 01:18:26.875]  This is something we've got to do.
[01:18:26.875 --> 01:18:29.917]  The only way we fail is not taking action.
[01:18:29.917 --> 01:18:33.220]  And so many people, when they don't succeed right away, get bummed out and quit.
[01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:35.302]  No, it's the animating contest of liberty.
[01:18:35.302 --> 01:18:41.526]  Now, I want to shift gears, Michael Snyder, very, very exciting, some of these stories you've been putting out with the economy and other things.
[01:18:41.526 --> 01:18:43.167]  As Ron Paul has said, Trump's in a race.
[01:18:44.128 --> 01:18:45.450]  Try to fix the economy.
[01:18:45.450 --> 01:18:52.537]  If we don't create this exuberance, if we don't create this good attitude, if we don't create the new jobs, we're going into a global depression.
[01:18:52.537 --> 01:18:57.162]  And so, let's hit that when we come back, but just briefly, what do you make of the Comey firing?
[01:18:57.162 --> 01:18:59.965]  I think it was absolutely needed and that more needs to come.
[01:19:01.221 --> 01:19:06.025]  Yeah, I completely support President Trump on this one, and it should have happened a long time ago.
[01:19:06.025 --> 01:19:11.969]  In fact, during the election, the Democrats were screaming for his head, but now that Trump has done it, they're getting all upset.
[01:19:11.969 --> 01:19:16.353]  You know, this is more of the partisan bickering, which we've, you know, grown so accustomed to.
[01:19:16.353 --> 01:19:19.355]  But yeah, I have no problem at all with Comey being fired.
[01:19:19.355 --> 01:19:21.216]  I fully support President Trump.
[01:19:21.216 --> 01:19:28.662]  But the Democrats are going to take any little opening that they think they can get to try to make a big thing out of it, to try to declare war on Donald Trump.
[01:19:28.662 --> 01:19:30.844]  And of course, Republicans in Congress, you know,
[01:19:31.596 --> 01:19:33.857]  Trump doesn't have a lot of friends in Congress right now.
[01:19:33.857 --> 01:19:35.818]  That's why we need to get him some friends.
[01:19:35.818 --> 01:19:41.100]  And, you know, because there's so many among the Republicans that they don't like him and they'll turn on him in a second.
[01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:47.822]  So I, for one, fully stand with President Trump and I'm glad that Comey was fired.
[01:19:47.822 --> 01:19:48.903]  Well, this is just breaking.
[01:19:48.903 --> 01:19:50.203]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[01:19:50.203 --> 01:19:51.784]  It's from CNBC.
[01:19:51.784 --> 01:19:54.185]  Trump said, I was going to fire Comey regardless.
[01:19:54.185 --> 01:19:55.525]  He was a showboat.
[01:19:55.525 --> 01:19:59.347]  That's exactly what I got is the fact that the guy is on a power trip.
[01:20:00.643 --> 01:20:01.744]  Think about this.
[01:20:01.744 --> 01:20:14.254]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[01:20:14.254 --> 01:20:18.478]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.
[01:20:18.478 --> 01:20:22.301]  Protect your family's water supply with a trusted Big Berkey Water Filter.
[01:20:22.301 --> 01:20:28.566]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show Big Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA,
[01:20:28.786 --> 01:20:31.268]  Pesticides, bacteria, and viruses.
[01:20:31.268 --> 01:20:33.289]  All forms of fluoride and much more.
[01:20:33.289 --> 01:20:36.791]  Big Berkey Water Filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[01:20:36.791 --> 01:20:38.993]  The gold standard in water purification.

[01:20:42.495 --> 01:20:43.216]  Big Berkey.
[01:20:43.216 --> 01:20:46.298]  The one powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.

[01:21:00.047 --> 01:21:05.431]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:21:05.431 --> 01:21:08.273]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[01:21:08.273 --> 01:21:10.234]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[01:21:10.234 --> 01:21:15.237]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[01:21:15.237 --> 01:21:17.339]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:21:17.339 --> 01:21:18.620]  In fact, it's certified.
[01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:23.523]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:21:23.703 --> 01:21:30.547]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:21:30.547 --> 01:21:33.529]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[01:21:33.529 --> 01:21:37.211]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide, some of the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:21:37.211 --> 01:21:44.075]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:21:44.075 --> 01:21:51.299]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue, chosen by our dental experts, include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano-silver, and more.

[01:21:59.568 --> 01:22:04.013]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[01:22:04.013 --> 01:22:05.615]  Those times may be near.
[01:22:05.615 --> 01:22:06.176]  Think about it.
[01:22:06.496 --> 01:22:11.120]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:16.124]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[01:22:16.124 --> 01:22:21.928]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[01:22:21.928 --> 01:22:28.634]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[01:22:28.634 --> 01:22:31.176]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[01:22:31.616 --> 01:22:34.417]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[01:24:21.092 --> 01:24:24.875]  You see, the globalists try to teach us all day we don't have any power.
[01:24:24.875 --> 01:24:27.817]  When you get in the WikiLeaks, you can pull these up.
[01:24:27.817 --> 01:24:29.639]  We wrote articles about them.
[01:24:29.639 --> 01:24:33.862]  It's, we gotta keep them desperate, we gotta keep them in the dark, we gotta keep them poor.
[01:24:33.862 --> 01:24:42.749]  And they say, well, they're not buying our lives anymore, but we're talking to our top psych warfare people, and the professors think we need to go ahead and use cultural warfare.
[01:24:44.312 --> 01:24:45.193]  We need to expand that.
[01:24:45.193 --> 01:24:49.376]  I mean, I've read these emails on air to the heads of the Democratic Party.
[01:24:49.376 --> 01:24:50.577]  What's cultural warfare?
[01:24:50.577 --> 01:24:52.919]  It's race garbage, folks.
[01:24:52.919 --> 01:25:00.965]  When they're up there on TV saying, if you don't like Obamacare, you're a racist, they know what they're doing.
[01:25:00.965 --> 01:25:08.330]  When the media points at me and says, maybe Jones is in the KKK, well, maybe you're child molesters.
[01:25:08.330 --> 01:25:10.432]  They just throw that out there.
[01:25:10.432 --> 01:25:11.333]  They know it's not true.
[01:25:13.456 --> 01:25:16.818]  And that's what's sick about these people is they hope you're a low-information voter.
[01:25:16.818 --> 01:25:19.719]  They hope you have the memory of a goldfish.
[01:25:19.719 --> 01:25:27.444]  In fact, there was a piece I never played the other day I asked Nico to put together where it's them, you know, hoping we have no memories.
[01:25:27.444 --> 01:25:28.284]  Gruber.
[01:25:28.284 --> 01:25:31.226]  And then it cuts to Dory from Finding Dory or Finding Nemo.
[01:25:32.329 --> 01:25:34.410]  Because there's two different movies, my kids have seen them.
[01:25:34.410 --> 01:25:37.811]  And it's actually a species of fish that has like a five second attention span.
[01:25:37.811 --> 01:25:39.212]  Goldfish have a seven second.
[01:25:39.212 --> 01:25:44.914]  There are studies that the average person below the age of 20, look it up, has less than a goldfish's memory.
[01:25:44.914 --> 01:25:47.415]  You can't get through to them.
[01:25:47.415 --> 01:25:49.816]  They've been totally programmed.
[01:25:49.816 --> 01:25:54.897]  And that's the ether, or using fish analogies, that these people have a swimming in.
[01:25:54.897 --> 01:25:57.859]  If we ever have a memory again, it's over.
[01:25:57.859 --> 01:25:58.459]  It's over.
[01:25:59.454 --> 01:26:01.575]  Michael Schneider, this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[01:26:01.575 --> 01:26:06.518]  I want to get into the economy, I want to get into Zuckerberg wanting to run for president, The Rock, all of that.
[01:26:06.518 --> 01:26:09.439]  But getting back to the FBI director, look at the acting director.
[01:26:09.439 --> 01:26:11.840]  This is up on Infowars.com by Jamie White.
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:15.722]  Acting FBI director, a Clinton ally, his wife gave $600,000.
[01:26:15.722 --> 01:26:21.826]  We're ferreting out the videos of him praising Barack Obama and the Clintons as well.
[01:26:23.221 --> 01:26:25.505]  I mean, this acting director, he's going to have to go.
[01:26:25.505 --> 01:26:28.430]  You know when he goes, they're going to claim that's more covering up.
[01:26:28.430 --> 01:26:32.758]  No, we can't have a bunch of people that rolled over to Clinton corruption in there.
[01:26:32.758 --> 01:26:34.200]  These people should be investigated.
[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:34.681]  What do you think?
[01:26:36.042 --> 01:26:37.822]  Oh, I completely agree.
[01:26:37.822 --> 01:26:41.023]  On a previous broadcast, I talked about how Trump needed a clean house.
[01:26:41.023 --> 01:26:50.245]  There are literally thousands of members of the deep state that are loyal to Clinton, that are loyal to Obama, even loyal to Bush, that have to go.
[01:26:50.245 --> 01:26:52.805]  And it's going to take Donald Trump some time to get rid of all of them.
[01:26:52.805 --> 01:26:54.726]  So it's not just Comey that has to go.
[01:26:54.726 --> 01:26:59.727]  He literally needs to fire hundreds, if not thousands of people and get good people in there.
[01:27:02.007 --> 01:27:07.752]  Donald Trump is going to have to find a lot of pro-Trump, pro-Liberty people just to appoint to different positions.
[01:27:07.752 --> 01:27:12.536]  It's going to be actually hard to find that many people who are willing to serve.
[01:27:12.536 --> 01:27:15.279]  So, I mean, we need a revolution in government.
[01:27:15.279 --> 01:27:16.880]  Because, like I said, it's become a total monster.
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:17.140]  That's right.
[01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:18.602]  Let's break this down since you raised that.
[01:27:19.102 --> 01:27:26.945]  The first 30-40 days he was totally perfect because there was no one replacing anybody, and Trump was finally doing executive orders and what he wanted, so things were changing.
[01:27:26.945 --> 01:27:34.788]  Then he actually tried to get people in but couldn't find any patriots because he's drawing from the swamp, from the sewage pit, and so he only got a few good people, most of them bad.
[01:27:34.788 --> 01:27:36.188]  They ignore his orders.
[01:27:36.188 --> 01:27:41.250]  He tries to compromise day 70, and so over the next 40 days things start going sideways.
[01:27:41.250 --> 01:27:45.192]  The word is Trump's gonna now veer way back into going with his own instinct.
[01:27:46.844 --> 01:27:55.628]  And I would definitely support that 100% because, you know, what he shared during the campaign was, it struck a chord with the American people.
[01:27:55.628 --> 01:27:57.489]  America first.
[01:27:57.489 --> 01:27:59.210]  Making America great again.
[01:27:59.210 --> 01:28:01.231]  Building a wall on the southern border.
[01:28:01.231 --> 01:28:02.231]  Restoring our economy.
[01:28:02.231 --> 01:28:03.712]  All the things that he wanted to do.
[01:28:03.712 --> 01:28:07.113]  He needs to get back to that message because the American people loved it.
[01:28:07.113 --> 01:28:09.354]  They made him president against all the odds.
[01:28:09.354 --> 01:28:11.015]  It was seemingly impossible.
[01:28:11.015 --> 01:28:12.796]  A crushing defeat of the establishment.
[01:28:12.796 --> 01:28:14.817]  A total rebuke of their elitist filth.
[01:28:16.593 --> 01:28:18.374]  Yeah, so the American people want it.
[01:28:18.374 --> 01:28:27.181]  They were just waiting for someone who could come along and be a fighter, fight for the message, and be able to communicate it in a way that people could understand.
[01:28:27.181 --> 01:28:28.321]  And so it happened.
[01:28:28.321 --> 01:28:34.266]  And so, yeah, Donald Trump needs to get back to his original message, and I'll fully support him in that.
[01:28:34.266 --> 01:28:36.968]  And that's what we need to do, get back to the original message.
[01:28:37.808 --> 01:28:40.730]  America, if we keep going the same way, we're in a huge amount of trouble.
[01:28:40.730 --> 01:28:50.735]  And when we come back from the break, we can talk about the things that are happening in cities like Chicago, the third largest city in the whole country, where we've got 150,000 gang members.
[01:28:50.735 --> 01:28:52.275]  And actually, that's a number from 2012.
[01:28:52.275 --> 01:28:53.656]  It's far worse by now.
[01:28:53.656 --> 01:28:55.897]  But the city is under siege by violence.
[01:28:55.897 --> 01:28:59.539]  The murder rate increased by more than 60% just last year.
[01:28:59.539 --> 01:29:03.501]  And it's mostly because of illegal immigration.
[01:29:03.501 --> 01:29:04.862]  That's why we need a wall.
[01:29:05.722 --> 01:29:24.046]  And so all these things, you know, we we would Trump needs to get back to that because people don't know Mexico's had 130,000 people killed second most dangerous country in the world after Afghanistan Now you've got the same thing in Chicago colonized by ms-13 Colonized by the worst elements bringing drugs up.
[01:29:24.046 --> 01:29:25.766]  They're clashing with the black gangs.
[01:29:25.766 --> 01:29:31.327]  That's what's going on and it's a total blood fest and of course you mentioned the fact that
[01:29:33.206 --> 01:29:35.227]  They're trying to implode the economy to control things.
[01:29:35.227 --> 01:29:40.368]  In the new Roger Stone documentary, they blame Trump for the implosion of the country, but he's the one trying to fix it.
[01:29:40.368 --> 01:29:41.549]  No, they're the ones.
[01:29:41.549 --> 01:29:43.349]  The globalists have been running the show.
[01:29:43.349 --> 01:29:45.330]  It's like they blame Trump for Obamacare.
[01:29:45.330 --> 01:29:46.390]  I mean, it's the craziest thing.
[01:29:46.390 --> 01:29:49.631]  We'll be back with Michael Snyder and your phone calls.
[01:29:49.631 --> 01:29:51.011]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.011 --> 01:29:53.552]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.552 --> 01:29:56.233]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.962 --> 01:30:05.746]  Last week, a study was released showing the differences between vaccinated kids and non-vaccinated kids.
[01:30:05.746 --> 01:30:11.251]  Infowars.com covered this, pointing out the pushback of these studies being censored, while more pushback has begun.
[01:30:11.251 --> 01:30:18.777]  The Boston Herald published an editorial from the entire editorial staff, which is now calling for anyone pushing anti-vaccine rhetoric to be hung.
[01:30:18.777 --> 01:30:25.363]  The well-written legal speak quote is, lying to vulnerable people about the health and safety of their children ought to be a hanging offense.
[01:30:25.583 --> 01:30:31.652]  This after insinuating that anti-vaccine people are responsible for a measles outbreak in a Somali community in Minnesota.
[01:30:31.652 --> 01:30:37.400]  This story claims as fact vaccines don't cause autism when some have it already listed as a side effect.
[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:41.846]  Of course the irony of their statement regarding hanging people who lie about the health and safety of children
[01:30:42.106 --> 01:30:50.750]  ...is it ultimately would fall back on them if they do indeed promote the idea that vaccines cannot be linked to autism, a blatant lie about the health and safety of children.
[01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:58.193]  My guess is this same editorial staff would support abortion, but somehow they don't believe that is a threat to the lives and safety of children.
[01:30:58.193 --> 01:31:00.474]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[01:31:00.714 --> 01:31:01.535]  Hey, everyone!
[01:31:01.535 --> 01:31:03.837]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[01:31:03.837 --> 01:31:07.680]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:09.762]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:31:09.762 --> 01:31:20.031]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:31:20.031 --> 01:31:26.017]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:31:26.477 --> 01:31:41.374]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[01:31:41.434 --> 01:31:42.014]  I think so.
[01:32:00.984 --> 01:32:02.426]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:32:02.426 --> 01:32:03.747]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:32:03.747 --> 01:32:04.948]  Why is this so good?
[01:32:04.948 --> 01:32:10.252]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:32:10.252 --> 01:32:23.783]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:32:23.783 --> 01:32:25.145]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:32:25.925 --> 01:32:27.566]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:32:27.566 --> 01:32:30.127]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:32:30.127 --> 01:32:31.447]  These are all parasites.
[01:32:31.447 --> 01:32:32.548]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:32:32.548 --> 01:32:33.888]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:32:33.888 --> 01:32:38.390]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:41.692]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:32:41.692 --> 01:32:44.733]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:32:44.733 --> 01:32:45.773]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:32:45.773 --> 01:32:47.694]  LivingDefense, InfowarsLife.com.
[01:32:47.694 --> 01:32:48.735]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:32:48.735 --> 01:32:51.456]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:32:51.456 --> 01:32:51.656]  And, uh...
[01:32:52.296 --> 01:32:53.337]  You support the broadcast.
[01:32:53.337 --> 01:32:54.679]  Infowarslive.com.
[01:32:54.679 --> 01:32:56.941]  Thank you Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:32:56.941 --> 01:33:08.153]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:33:08.153 --> 01:33:10.315]  I got a number 13 tattooed on my back.
[01:33:13.550 --> 01:33:15.012]  Lucky 13.
[01:33:15.012 --> 01:33:17.094]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:17.094 --> 01:33:17.655]  Lucky for us.
[01:33:17.655 --> 01:33:18.857]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:18.857 --> 01:33:19.497]  Not for them.
[01:33:19.497 --> 01:33:22.621]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[01:33:29.952 --> 01:33:31.634]  Look, and whose fault is this?
[01:33:31.634 --> 01:33:37.462]  Before President Trump was elected, there were no counties in America that did not have an insurer.
[01:33:37.462 --> 01:33:43.971]  Since President Trump's been elected, and massively... Wait, you're going to blame the problems with Obamacare on President Trump?
[01:33:44.912 --> 01:33:54.455]  We had a situation under Obamacare where there was a one-time premium increase last year that made up for the fact that insurers massively underpriced in the first two years.
[01:33:54.455 --> 01:33:56.896]  The problem was fixed.
[01:33:56.896 --> 01:33:58.396]  Profits were trending positively.
[01:33:58.396 --> 01:34:03.278]  Insurers were saying positive things about their ability to stay in the exchange and succeed.
[01:34:03.278 --> 01:34:09.920]  Then you have a president who comes in, undercuts open enrollment, doesn't honor the obligations this law makes to insurers.
[01:34:10.939 --> 01:34:13.520]  And as a result, premiums are going up and insurers are exiting.
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:15.841]  You can look at the quotes from insurers themselves.
[01:34:15.841 --> 01:34:19.883]  I think the short attention span of the American public works as advantage here.
[01:34:19.883 --> 01:34:20.903]  I'm so sorry.
[01:34:20.903 --> 01:34:24.765]  See, I suffer from short-term memory loss.
[01:34:24.765 --> 01:34:26.226]  Short-term memory loss.
[01:34:29.181 --> 01:34:38.866]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've all watched Obamacare passed six years ago, implemented in the last five years, increased everybody I know's premiums at least 30-40%.
[01:34:38.866 --> 01:34:46.550]  A lot of people that had really low insurance rates because they've been paying a long time and didn't have a lot of conditions or problems had it doubled.
[01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:48.871]  My parents have had it more than doubled.
[01:34:48.871 --> 01:34:58.816]  And then they have the nerve to have him crawl back on television and come out with the unreal statement that it's Trump's fault.
[01:35:00.114 --> 01:35:06.076]  When already states were dumping it and already insurers were getting out in the last five years.
[01:35:06.076 --> 01:35:17.260]  And as the thing completely goes online this year, and the penalties go up to $5,000 a person.
[01:35:17.260 --> 01:35:24.842]  Remember that just three years ago when they said Matt Drudge was a conspiracy theorist, that there was no penalty?
[01:35:24.842 --> 01:35:25.883]  And that they didn't hire 18,000 IRS agents?
[01:35:28.049 --> 01:35:29.450]  There is a penalty.
[01:35:29.450 --> 01:35:31.932]  They did hire them.
[01:35:31.932 --> 01:35:37.437]  Anybody that didn't go out and get the overpriced health care knows they got hit with a penalty.
[01:35:37.437 --> 01:35:47.526]  A lot of my friends that work at this office that haven't chosen to get the insurance we offer, that's pretty good, they've just chosen to wing it because they want to keep more of their money, they've been hit with $1,500 and $2,000 penalties.
[01:35:47.526 --> 01:35:52.690]  McBrain has shown his penalty on air, but Gruber just says none of that happened.
[01:35:52.690 --> 01:35:54.592]  It's happening now because of Trump.
[01:35:56.121 --> 01:36:00.702]  Talk about a crazy liar.
[01:36:00.702 --> 01:36:04.743]  It's falling apart because it's been looting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
[01:36:04.743 --> 01:36:11.265]  It's falling apart because Ezekiel Emanuel and Gruber said on Fox News, we're going to put a bigger piece together.
[01:36:11.265 --> 01:36:16.147]  Where it actually shows them, not just that one clip saying, thank God people are so dumb, thank God they have no memories, thank God they're so stupid.
[01:36:16.147 --> 01:36:17.107]  There's like six clips of it.
[01:36:17.107 --> 01:36:20.508]  Remember, he said he only said it once, didn't mean it, and they showed like five other clips of it.
[01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:27.343]  And then he said it's meant to wreck healthcare and bring in a single-payer.
[01:36:27.343 --> 01:36:30.466]  Ezekiel Emanuel said that.
[01:36:30.466 --> 01:36:39.275]  And we have to bring all those clips back and show you what they said and show others or they're gonna believe that Donald Trump's the reason their healthcare is doubled or tripled prices.
[01:36:39.275 --> 01:36:42.658]  That it's Donald Trump's fault that there isn't Obamacare in their state.
[01:36:45.273 --> 01:36:47.615]  And then see when it doesn't work, or they don't get healthcare.
[01:36:47.615 --> 01:36:48.836]  Oh, that's his fault too.
[01:36:48.836 --> 01:36:50.938]  It was always designed to wreck it.
[01:36:50.938 --> 01:36:52.139]  Just search.
[01:36:52.139 --> 01:36:54.902]  Architect of Obamacare says it's meant to destroy healthcare.
[01:36:54.902 --> 01:36:56.623]  Ezekiel Emanuel.
[01:36:56.623 --> 01:36:59.425]  You'll get the clip.
[01:36:59.425 --> 01:37:00.867]  But see, I remember all those statements.
[01:37:00.867 --> 01:37:02.128]  I don't need to be shown them again.
[01:37:02.128 --> 01:37:04.490]  But I tell friends and family that.
[01:37:04.490 --> 01:37:05.791]  They go, oh yeah, really Alex?
[01:37:05.791 --> 01:37:06.552]  I don't remember that.
[01:37:09.284 --> 01:37:16.009]  I was telling some family just the other day, I was like, yeah, there's two new studies that unvaccinated kids are way, way healthier than vaccinated.
[01:37:16.009 --> 01:37:17.150]  I'll believe that when I see it.
[01:37:17.150 --> 01:37:21.033]  I pulled up the articles.
[01:37:21.033 --> 01:37:23.535]  Flashback, Obamacare architect.
[01:37:23.535 --> 01:37:26.337]  ACA designed to implode, destroy insurance companies.
[01:37:26.337 --> 01:37:27.698]  There it is.
[01:37:27.698 --> 01:37:30.179]  You want us to play it for you?
[01:37:30.179 --> 01:37:34.583]  And it's the arrogance of these people when they sit there with these Cheshire smiles
[01:37:37.045 --> 01:37:40.706]  And of course, the Obamacare architect says society would be better if people died at 75!
[01:37:40.706 --> 01:37:45.127]  See, they have this sum-pie game where we don't take care of people.
[01:37:45.127 --> 01:37:49.088]  By taking care of people, we build jobs, we build an economy, we build the future.
[01:37:49.088 --> 01:37:50.569]  That's what civilization is based on.
[01:37:50.569 --> 01:38:03.232]  But under their zero-sum game, they want a world where things are scarcer, where things are worse, where humans don't advance but we're trampled on, we degenerate, we have less quality, Winston.
[01:38:04.730 --> 01:38:08.993]  If you want to see the future of humanity, Winston, it's a boot stomping on the human face forever.
[01:38:08.993 --> 01:38:15.497]  And by the time I'm done brainwashing you, Winston, you're going to love big government.
[01:38:15.497 --> 01:38:15.517]  1984.
[01:38:15.517 --> 01:38:17.819]  Michael Steiner is our guest.
[01:38:17.819 --> 01:38:18.699]  Toll-free number to join us.
[01:38:18.699 --> 01:38:20.541]  Just talking about the state of the world, state of the economy.
[01:38:20.541 --> 01:38:21.641]  800-259-9231.
[01:38:21.641 --> 01:38:22.782]  The Comey firing.
[01:38:22.782 --> 01:38:22.882]  800-259-9231.
[01:38:22.882 --> 01:38:24.223]  First-time callers, long-time callers.
[01:38:24.223 --> 01:38:24.263]  800-259-9231.
[01:38:32.298 --> 01:38:35.639]  I'm gonna go to Snyder now to go into some of his articles, what's happening in Chicago.
[01:38:35.639 --> 01:38:39.119]  A former congressman and others saying the economy is on the verge of imploding.
[01:38:39.119 --> 01:38:39.900]  Ron Paul agrees.
[01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:43.020]  They're gonna blame Trump when it happens.
[01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:47.701]  He knows with everything he can, according to basic economics, to stop it.
[01:38:47.701 --> 01:38:50.282]  But it doesn't matter, we'll just blame him for Obamacare too.
[01:38:50.282 --> 01:38:54.063]  Hell, you smoke three packs of cigarettes a day, you get lung cancer, blame it on Trump!
[01:38:54.063 --> 01:38:56.463]  You slip and fall on the ice, it's Trump's fault!
[01:38:56.463 --> 01:38:58.603]  Get a hemorrhoid, it's Trump's fault!
[01:38:58.603 --> 01:39:00.884]  Your kids don't get A+, it's Trump's fault!
[01:39:02.921 --> 01:39:04.904]  Victimology culture.
[01:39:04.904 --> 01:39:06.988]  I don't get up here and expose the corruption because I'm a victim.
[01:39:06.988 --> 01:39:08.230]  I want to overcome it.
[01:39:08.230 --> 01:39:10.694]  I'm telling you about the problems, believing you want to fix it.
[01:39:10.694 --> 01:39:11.155]  800-259-9231.
[01:39:11.155 --> 01:39:11.335]  Briefly.
[01:39:15.612 --> 01:39:17.693]  Our great product, Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:39:17.693 --> 01:39:22.477]  We went out and looked at the very best vitamin and mineral drinks that are out there, so you get better absorption through those.
[01:39:22.477 --> 01:39:27.300]  There's some other great brands out there as well, like Beyond Tangy Tangerine that we sell at Infowarsteam.com.
[01:39:27.300 --> 01:39:28.761]  It's great.
[01:39:28.761 --> 01:39:29.661]  Ours is excellent as well.
[01:39:29.661 --> 01:39:35.025]  It's Concentrated Vitamin Mineral Fusion Advanced Multivitamin Formulation.
[01:39:35.025 --> 01:39:37.206]  It's concentrated.
[01:39:37.206 --> 01:39:39.848]  One little tiny scoop, couple scoops makes a whole pitcher.
[01:39:39.848 --> 01:39:41.329]  Your kids will love it.
[01:39:41.329 --> 01:39:42.610]  You mix it in with a little bit of soda,
[01:39:44.217 --> 01:39:45.679]  Just soda with a little sugar in it.
[01:39:45.679 --> 01:39:46.239]  Club soda.
[01:39:46.239 --> 01:39:47.600]  Tastes like a great soft drink.
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:49.301]  Get it real cold in your refrigerator.
[01:39:49.301 --> 01:39:51.783]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:39:51.783 --> 01:39:53.565]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:39:53.565 --> 01:39:54.205]  And it is powerful.
[01:39:54.205 --> 01:39:57.167]  It's got amino acids to absorb it better.
[01:39:57.167 --> 01:39:58.288]  This is really amazing.
[01:39:58.288 --> 01:39:59.549]  Great thing for you and your family.
[01:39:59.549 --> 01:40:01.691]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:40:01.691 --> 01:40:04.053]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:40:04.053 --> 01:40:04.213]  Or 888-253-3139.
[01:40:09.048 --> 01:40:11.490]  Also, X2 is about to sell out.
[01:40:11.490 --> 01:40:13.231]  DNA Force is about to sell out.
[01:40:13.231 --> 01:40:17.194]  We've got the new toothpaste back in that's fluoride-free with colloidal silver and iodine.
[01:40:17.194 --> 01:40:17.795]  It's great.
[01:40:17.795 --> 01:40:18.996]  People really love it.
[01:40:18.996 --> 01:40:20.197]  You can get a discount.
[01:40:20.197 --> 01:40:24.180]  It's already 30% off, but you can get an additional 10% off when you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:40:24.180 --> 01:40:25.981]  That's something you're going to need to reorder.
[01:40:25.981 --> 01:40:31.125]  And I know a lot of you, just like I bring home stuff for myself, and then it runs out, and I go, why don't I have my own toothpaste?
[01:40:31.125 --> 01:40:35.629]  Why am I catching myself on the weekend driving to the corner store to get toothpaste?
[01:40:35.629 --> 01:40:37.611]  Just because I don't want to drive to work and get more out of the warehouse?
[01:40:38.772 --> 01:40:39.052]  I don't know.
[01:40:59.147 --> 01:41:05.749]  So I actually set up my own credit card auto-ship to get two bottles of it, because my children use the bubblegum type.
[01:41:05.749 --> 01:41:06.989]  It's not as strong.
[01:41:06.989 --> 01:41:08.930]  A fluoride-free toothpaste, super blue.
[01:41:08.930 --> 01:41:10.650]  And so I've done that.
[01:41:10.650 --> 01:41:13.631]  And that's how you remember to always support us and support yourself.
[01:41:13.631 --> 01:41:14.511]  Get the X2.

[01:41:31.457 --> 01:41:35.359]  Order two bottles at a time, but the best way to do it is just order one.
[01:41:35.359 --> 01:41:37.980]  Because here's the deal, you're not driving to the shop, you're not doing that.
[01:41:37.980 --> 01:41:41.622]  You get 10% off, and then you just get it when you need it.
[01:41:41.622 --> 01:41:45.564]  Every 15 days, every 30, every 60, every 80, every 90, whatever.
[01:41:45.564 --> 01:41:46.165]  It's all there.

[01:41:52.028 --> 01:41:54.429]  Just Peruse and CyberSurf.
[01:41:55.666 --> 01:41:59.189]  The site, InfoWarsTore.com, and you are fighting the tip of the spear.
[01:41:59.189 --> 01:42:04.933]  The globalists hate it, and we're a platform to have all these other great readers and researchers and writers and activists on.
[01:42:04.933 --> 01:42:06.914]  Of course, your phone calls, so that's coming up.
[01:42:06.914 --> 01:42:10.277]  All right, Snyder, I appreciate you and the fine work you're doing.
[01:42:10.277 --> 01:42:19.483]  Let's lay out from your deep research and their own admissions, the elite fleeing the West, fleeing the big cities, themselves doing all this while they prepare to run for president.
[01:42:19.483 --> 01:42:23.706]  Zuckerberg, what's happening in Baltimore, even worse than Chicago in some numbers.
[01:42:23.706 --> 01:42:24.547]  Let's break that down.
[01:42:26.047 --> 01:42:45.241]  Yeah, a couple days ago I wrote an article which went viral on the Drudge Report, was posted on the Drudge Report, got a ton of attention about Chicago, the third largest city in America, once one of the greatest cities in the world, has descended into and basically becoming a total nightmare because you've got the gangs that are just pouring in.
[01:42:45.241 --> 01:42:50.244]  At this point, gang members outnumber the police in Chicago by more than a 12 to 1 margin.
[01:42:51.645 --> 01:43:00.888]  And it's thanks to unchecked illegal immigration, the Latin American gangs coming across the border are just pouring into places like Chicago and creating violence like crazy.
[01:43:00.888 --> 01:43:10.172]  In fact, just this week, the Chicago police issued an alert telling every member of the Chicago police force about the high-powered weapons that the gangs are using.
[01:43:10.172 --> 01:43:12.613]  Because they're just not using, you know, little pop guns.
[01:43:12.613 --> 01:43:15.494]  They're using automatic weapons in many cases.
[01:43:15.994 --> 01:43:19.097]  And so Chicago's totally out of control, so people are leaving.
[01:43:19.097 --> 01:43:30.850]  In fact, last year, 2016, Cook County had lost more people through domestic migration than any other county in America, because people are getting out.
[01:43:30.850 --> 01:43:31.971]  And in one recent year, 2015,
[01:43:34.073 --> 01:43:38.416]  3,000 millionaires, millionaires left the city of Chicago for other places.
[01:43:38.416 --> 01:43:39.937]  So people are fleeing.
[01:43:39.937 --> 01:43:40.657]  They're getting out.
[01:43:40.657 --> 01:43:47.402]  They don't want to raise their families where there's so much violence, so much crime, where things are completely out of control.
[01:43:47.402 --> 01:43:49.243]  But of course, this is not just happening in Chicago.
[01:43:49.243 --> 01:43:50.264]  It's happening all over the country.
[01:43:50.264 --> 01:43:51.165]  You look at Baltimore.
[01:43:51.605 --> 01:43:56.669]  Where this horrible drug epidemic, I mean, literally, you can go through Baltimore.
[01:43:56.669 --> 01:43:59.811]  I've been to Baltimore many times when I used to live out on the East Coast.
[01:43:59.811 --> 01:44:06.396]  You can drive through the bad parts of Baltimore and you'll see bombed out houses everywhere, blackened houses, abandoned buildings.
[01:44:06.396 --> 01:44:13.862]  But you'll drive down the street, you'll literally see drug addicts just lying in the street like zombies because it's so bad.
[01:44:13.862 --> 01:44:17.965]  And Baltimore, they're on pace for their worst murder rate ever.
[01:44:18.726 --> 01:44:18.966]  I think?
[01:44:36.005 --> 01:44:38.568]  But, you know, Chicago, Baltimore, it's happening all over.
[01:44:38.568 --> 01:44:41.551]  Detroit, it's happening all over America.
[01:44:41.551 --> 01:44:48.598]  Forgotten cities, forgotten towns, especially up in the Rust Belt, where we see these drugs.
[01:44:48.598 --> 01:44:54.544]  Some of these drugs that are coming into some of these communities, they're a hundred more times potent than heroin.
[01:44:55.224 --> 01:45:05.949]  And we've got this horrible drug, this is especially true in places like West Virginia and Kentucky, throughout the Appalachians where the jobs have gone, where the industries have been shut down.
[01:45:05.949 --> 01:45:10.892]  Obama, he said he would destroy the coal industry and he really, you know, he really did that.
[01:45:11.412 --> 01:45:17.999]  And so these people are out of work, they maybe can get some work at Walmart, but they're down, they're depressed, they're defeated.
[01:45:17.999 --> 01:45:25.446]  That's why so many people voted for Trump in those areas, because they're economically depressed and so many people are turning to these drugs.
[01:45:25.446 --> 01:45:32.854]  This is a major national crisis and somebody needs to start addressing.
[01:45:32.854 --> 01:45:35.036]  Let's keep walking through this and where you think this is going.
[01:45:36.829 --> 01:45:49.164]  Yeah, well, where it's going, if we see crime exploding in Chicago, the murder rate increases 60% last year, while the economy is still relatively stable, what's going to happen if we have a major downturn?
[01:45:49.164 --> 01:45:56.253]  Because, you know, right now, Alex, the number of retail bankruptcies has already surpassed all of last year.
[01:45:56.833 --> 01:46:04.639]  And if we continue at the same pace that we're on, we're going to break the all-time yearly record for store closings for retail stores by more than 20%.
[01:46:04.639 --> 01:46:07.161]  We're not just going to break the record.
[01:46:07.161 --> 01:46:09.463]  We're going to absolutely shatter it.
[01:46:09.463 --> 01:46:10.643]  Auto sales are down.
[01:46:10.643 --> 01:46:12.405]  The auto industry is in a panic.
[01:46:12.845 --> 01:46:18.729]  The people who are defaulting on their auto loans, the highest rate since the last recession.
[01:46:18.729 --> 01:46:22.711]  Commercial bankruptcies are increasing at the fastest rate since the last recession.
[01:46:22.711 --> 01:46:27.114]  Consumer bankruptcies are increasing at the fastest rate since the last recession.
[01:46:27.114 --> 01:46:31.277]  So we've got all these economic red flags going up all around us.
[01:46:31.277 --> 01:46:40.943]  Meanwhile, the stock market bubble is just crazy, where the stock market bubble has been going to all-time record highs, but you've got companies like Twitter, like Netflix, like Tesla,
[01:46:41.483 --> 01:46:41.864]  We're good to go.
[01:47:01.281 --> 01:47:02.281]  Of all time.
[01:47:02.281 --> 01:47:05.082]  And when it bursts, well, Trump's going to get blamed for it.
[01:47:05.082 --> 01:47:17.826]  When that economy, the economy was already trending down under Obama in the first quarter, economic growth of about 1% trending down, you know, and when it keeps going down, Trump's going to get blamed.
[01:47:17.826 --> 01:47:20.406]  But it started under Obama.
[01:47:20.406 --> 01:47:21.887]  These trends started under Obama.
[01:47:21.887 --> 01:47:23.527]  So Obama should get the blame.
[01:47:23.527 --> 01:47:24.847]  But Trump's going to get the blame.
[01:47:24.847 --> 01:47:30.189]  And we've already got so much anger and frustration and racial tensions being stirred up in our inner cities.
[01:47:30.789 --> 01:47:32.011]  That's right.
[01:47:32.011 --> 01:47:33.493]  We've had a 50-year rot of America.
[01:47:45.438 --> 01:47:50.239]  We have brought in giant third world populations that have no history of living in a free country or being upwardly mobile.
[01:47:50.239 --> 01:47:51.379]  They're put on welfare.
[01:47:51.379 --> 01:47:52.560]  They're made to be liberal.
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:54.500]  They're made to have chips on their shoulders right away.
[01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:56.620]  Drugs are then shipped in for them.
[01:47:56.620 --> 01:48:02.662]  Trump is desperately trying to get jobs into the areas, desperately trying to create exuberance, trying to create a good attitude.
[01:48:02.662 --> 01:48:05.983]  Everybody knows with the dollar, you name it, it's all about confidence.
[01:48:05.983 --> 01:48:07.483]  And then the media is blaming him.
[01:48:08.848 --> 01:48:17.410]  When he's desperately trying to right the ship, you go to the Detroit's, you go to the Baltimore's, you go to the Chicago's, you go to the Democrat-run areas.
[01:48:17.410 --> 01:48:20.111]  They are literal hellholes of idiocy.
[01:48:20.111 --> 01:48:21.992]  Homeless people everywhere.
[01:48:21.992 --> 01:48:24.052]  Looks like a zombie invasion in Houston.
[01:48:24.052 --> 01:48:25.152]  It's now liberal.
[01:48:25.152 --> 01:48:27.073]  Texas is going blue.
[01:48:27.073 --> 01:48:30.454]  And there's no upwardly mobile, there's hardly even cars driving around.
[01:48:31.420 --> 01:48:32.421]  It's crazy.
[01:48:32.421 --> 01:48:40.346]  Then you go to libertarian or conservative areas, it's beautiful buildings being built, culture everywhere, people of all races, colors and creeds that want to be upwardly mobile doing great.
[01:48:40.346 --> 01:48:42.227]  It's about an attitude.
[01:48:42.227 --> 01:48:46.290]  And it's like watching the soul being sucked out of these areas.
[01:48:46.290 --> 01:48:47.150]  It's just crazy.
[01:48:47.150 --> 01:48:50.553]  And then to see them blame Trump, they know what they're doing.
[01:48:50.553 --> 01:48:58.078]  They know that they want to have a giant mass of disenfranchised people that will vote to get rid of freedom.
[01:48:59.056 --> 01:49:02.740]  They get rid of free market, and then they can socially engineer things the way they want.
[01:49:02.740 --> 01:49:07.126]  This is a military, globalist, de-industrialization, destruction of our culture.
[01:49:08.379 --> 01:49:19.407]  Yeah, that's why we need to fight globalism so much, because if you look, every single major city that's been under progressive or liberal democratic leadership for an extended period of time, they're falling apart.
[01:49:19.407 --> 01:49:25.130]  You look, even New York City, the number of homeless in New York City has just set a brand new record high.
[01:49:25.130 --> 01:49:29.934]  In Los Angeles, homelessness is so out of control that the L.A.
[01:49:29.934 --> 01:49:37.319]  City Council actually asked Governor Jerry Brown to declare a state of emergency in the state of California just because of homelessness.
[01:49:37.839 --> 01:49:44.161]  And so we're seeing record numbers leaving New York and California, and then most Californians weren't even Californians.
[01:49:44.161 --> 01:49:48.082]  They were folks going there to be famous or, you know, looking for a get-rich-quick scheme or whatever.
[01:49:48.082 --> 01:49:49.082]  So I don't want to blame Californians.
[01:49:49.082 --> 01:49:56.265]  But the point is, Austin is now a colony of failed people that went to California the last 30 years.
[01:49:56.265 --> 01:50:04.167]  They literally don't know why they're losers, but all they know is how to be trendies and followers, so they're trying to pass laws to turn it into California.
[01:50:04.167 --> 01:50:06.448]  So they're not even smart enough to climb out of the sewage
[01:50:07.188 --> 01:50:11.852]  Didn't they try to put themselves back into the sewage with us?
[01:50:11.852 --> 01:50:12.533]  Oh, it's very true.
[01:50:12.533 --> 01:50:14.935]  Same thing happening up in this part of the country, Alex.
[01:50:14.935 --> 01:50:20.260]  If you go to the grocery store, you go in a mix of people at church or different places and you ask people, where are you from?
[01:50:20.260 --> 01:50:28.328]  About half the people are from California up here, where they, a lot of them come up here and then they want to change this area to be like California.
[01:50:28.328 --> 01:50:32.752]  And we're not realizing that the reason they left California in the first place is because it's become so terrible.
[01:50:33.292 --> 01:50:37.095]  Why is everything not free in Idaho or Texas?
[01:50:37.095 --> 01:50:39.997]  It's because we actually want jobs and money, dummy.
[01:50:39.997 --> 01:50:41.078]  You can't have everything free.
[01:50:41.078 --> 01:50:42.258]  Look at Venezuela.
[01:50:42.258 --> 01:50:45.821]  Go to Venezuela, Californians, if you want a free pot of gold.
[01:50:45.821 --> 01:50:48.202]  It doesn't exist, dumbos.
[01:50:48.202 --> 01:50:50.344]  It doesn't exist, dumbos.
[01:50:50.344 --> 01:50:53.186]  It doesn't exist, jackasses!
[01:50:53.186 --> 01:50:55.267]  Stop trying to blow the ship up!
[01:50:55.267 --> 01:50:56.268]  God, you people are dumb.
[01:50:56.268 --> 01:50:57.549]  I'm talking about our audience.
[01:50:57.549 --> 01:50:58.429]  Talking to the idiots.
[01:50:58.429 --> 01:50:59.310]  We'll be back with your phone calls.
[01:51:01.095 --> 01:51:03.057]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:51:03.057 --> 01:51:08.381]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:51:08.381 --> 01:51:09.963]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:51:09.963 --> 01:51:18.310]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:51:18.310 --> 01:51:23.995]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:51:24.175 --> 01:51:25.996]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:51:25.996 --> 01:51:28.258]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:51:28.258 --> 01:51:32.661]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:51:32.661 --> 01:51:34.862]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:51:34.862 --> 01:51:42.648]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:51:43.268 --> 01:51:43.749]  We're good to go.
[01:52:00.467 --> 01:52:02.348]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[01:52:02.348 --> 01:52:08.931]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[01:52:08.931 --> 01:52:12.072]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[01:52:12.072 --> 01:52:21.816]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single, great-tasting formula.
[01:52:21.816 --> 01:52:22.657]  Caveman.
[01:52:22.657 --> 01:52:27.699]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[01:52:27.699 --> 01:52:29.800]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:33.241]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[01:52:33.241 --> 01:52:38.362]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[01:52:38.362 --> 01:52:46.463]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[01:52:46.463 --> 01:52:54.205]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[01:52:54.205 --> 01:52:59.006]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself in 4WarsLife.com today.
[01:52:59.611 --> 01:53:01.794]  I'm Chris Walls, and I'm a truck driver from Missouri.
[01:53:01.794 --> 01:53:04.557]  For 13 hours a night, I sit in my truck, and I drive.
[01:53:04.557 --> 01:53:06.159]  Out of boredom, I'll stop and eat.
[01:53:06.159 --> 01:53:09.883]  If I'm not doing fast food, I guarantee there's a bag of chips open on my dashboard.
[01:53:09.883 --> 01:53:11.645]  That was all until Andro 400.
[01:53:11.645 --> 01:53:16.290]  I started out four months ago, and since taking Andro 400, I have dropped 45 pounds.
[01:53:16.290 --> 01:53:17.211]  I'm sleeping better.
[01:53:17.211 --> 01:53:17.952]  There's no craving.
[01:53:18.192 --> 01:53:19.874]  I actually don't even think about food.
[01:53:19.874 --> 01:53:21.415]  My knee pain went away.
[01:53:21.415 --> 01:53:28.121]  I've had some lower back issues and I've noticed that that went away and I can only contribute that to Andro 400.
[01:53:28.121 --> 01:53:31.544]  One thing that Andro 400 said on the radio ad is it attacks belly fat.
[01:53:31.544 --> 01:53:32.785]  Well, let me tell you it did.
[01:53:32.785 --> 01:53:37.850]  The second month is where I saw a drastic change in the size of my stomach.
[01:53:37.850 --> 01:53:39.091]  I've lost six inches.
[01:53:39.091 --> 01:53:40.412]  This product really does work.
[01:53:40.692 --> 01:53:46.014]  So guys, if you'd like to experience similar results, then get Andro 400.
[01:53:46.014 --> 01:53:50.275]  The safe, natural, and inexpensive way to boost your testosterone.
[01:53:50.275 --> 01:53:51.356]  Go to andro400.com or call 888-400-0435.
[01:53:51.356 --> 01:53:51.436]  888-400-0435.
[01:53:51.436 --> 01:53:52.156]  I hear the train a-comin'.
[01:53:52.156 --> 01:53:53.236]  It's rollin' around the bend.
[01:54:08.250 --> 01:54:12.413]  And I ain't seen the sunshine.
[01:54:12.413 --> 01:54:14.555]  I don't know when.
[01:54:14.555 --> 01:54:17.177]  I'm stuck in Folsom Prison.
[01:54:17.177 --> 01:54:25.263]  And time keeps dragging on.
[01:54:25.263 --> 01:54:27.865]  On down.
[01:54:27.865 --> 01:54:34.010]  I was just a baby.
[01:54:34.010 --> 01:54:35.331]  Don't be an idiot.
[01:54:35.331 --> 01:54:36.452]  Don't support communism.
[01:54:39.245 --> 01:54:47.251]  Let's expand on that.
[01:54:47.251 --> 01:54:51.635]  First caller I'm going to go to, Scott, says, Trump being a globalist, backtracking.
[01:54:51.635 --> 01:54:52.635]  I care about results.
[01:54:52.635 --> 01:55:01.202]  Trump came out and said, I'm a nationalist, but I'm also a globalist in that we have a global system and I will use global systems for America's interest.
[01:55:01.202 --> 01:55:02.543]  That's what I said on Inauguration Day.
[01:55:03.504 --> 01:55:07.208]  America helped build this whole globalist system for the big global combines.
[01:55:07.208 --> 01:55:13.975]  Now for our own interests, we can use it to empower the United States and actually empower other countries on a two-way street.
[01:55:13.975 --> 01:55:15.136]  So Trump's going to have to compromise.
[01:55:15.136 --> 01:55:20.802]  I totally got what he meant by saying, because he's a pragmatist, I'm a nationalist.
[01:55:20.802 --> 01:55:23.545]  I'm going to do it for American interests, but I'm going to use global systems.
[01:55:23.545 --> 01:55:25.587]  Global systems isn't globalism.
[01:55:26.448 --> 01:55:27.969]  I think the choice of words is a better saying.
[01:55:27.969 --> 01:55:33.611]  You know, I'm a globalist, too, because a globalist means world government and they believe in all that and want that system.
[01:55:33.611 --> 01:55:38.933]  So I think the choice of words, I care about action and the establishments after him for a reason.
[01:55:38.933 --> 01:55:43.915]  They know he's real, but we'll get Michael Sanders' take on that and then go to Scott.
[01:55:43.915 --> 01:55:47.456]  So, Scott, we'll go to you in a second, but what's your take on Scott's point?
[01:55:49.173 --> 01:55:51.334]  Oh, I completely agree with you, Alex.
[01:55:51.334 --> 01:55:53.255]  Donald Trump is a nationalist.
[01:55:53.255 --> 01:55:54.636]  He wants to put America first.
[01:55:54.636 --> 01:55:59.099]  He's said that all along, and so the choice of words may not have been ideal there.
[01:55:59.099 --> 01:56:00.199]  I agree with you.
[01:56:00.199 --> 01:56:07.223]  But yeah, Donald Trump is the heart of this trend against globalism.
[01:56:07.223 --> 01:56:10.385]  But right now, he doesn't have a lot of allies in Washington, D.C.
[01:56:10.385 --> 01:56:17.409]  That's why what we need to do, Alex, we need to get a pro-Trump, because if people don't run, we're not going to have a choice.
[01:56:18.109 --> 01:56:18.549]  That's it.
[01:56:18.549 --> 01:56:23.832]  He should be organizing the Trumpian nationalist movement, Tea Party 2.0.
[01:56:23.832 --> 01:56:26.353]  Yeah, so let's do it.
[01:56:26.353 --> 01:56:34.738]  Let's get a pro-Trump person, someone that lives liberty and freedom, that'll support Trump, running for every seat in America, so we actually have a choice.
[01:56:34.738 --> 01:56:36.819]  If nobody runs, then we don't have a choice.
[01:56:36.819 --> 01:56:39.501]  We're just going to end up with establishment candidates again.
[01:56:39.501 --> 01:56:41.682]  Let's challenge every seat in America.
[01:56:41.682 --> 01:56:44.623]  Well, I totally agree with you.
[01:56:44.623 --> 01:56:47.065]  Let's go ahead and go to Scott in Vermont.
[01:56:47.065 --> 01:56:47.405]  Go ahead.
[01:56:48.663 --> 01:56:49.423]  Hi, Alex.
[01:56:49.423 --> 01:56:49.923]  Hey, buddy.
[01:56:49.923 --> 01:56:51.944]  I've been listening to you since 1998.
[01:56:51.944 --> 01:56:54.625]  I think it was when I first heard you on the shortwave.
[01:56:54.625 --> 01:56:55.125]  Wow.
[01:56:55.125 --> 01:56:59.627]  And I woke up to the new old order if you started waking up to it even before that.
[01:56:59.627 --> 01:57:02.448]  But thanks for all you do as far as waking people up.
[01:57:02.448 --> 01:57:11.351]  Now, last night, Pat Buchanan, he was just on your show, but last night he was on the Leslie Gold Show, which is a Fox News show, the former Alan Combs show.
[01:57:11.351 --> 01:57:18.094]  And I called the producer and I asked him to bring, to have the host bring this up with Mr. Buchanan, the fact that
[01:57:19.517 --> 01:57:24.519]  Trump, he said it only once, I think, during his campaign, he's anti-globalist.
[01:57:24.519 --> 01:57:40.645]  But here he was, meeting with the biggest globalist since David Rockefeller died a couple months ago, his protege Kissinger, the biggest globalist in the world, has written articles about how he not only loves the new old order, but loves chaos so they can bring about their new old order.
[01:57:40.645 --> 01:57:42.165]  No, no, I totally agree with you.
[01:57:42.165 --> 01:57:43.806]  Trump said a lot in his campaign ads.
[01:57:43.806 --> 01:57:46.567]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
[01:57:47.567 --> 01:57:51.129]  Uh, and so, you look at Kissinger, that's how Trump's gonna get things done.
[01:57:51.129 --> 01:57:54.051]  He's using Kissinger, not the other way around.
[01:57:54.051 --> 01:57:59.054]  If I see him start engaging in, you know, Kissinger-type New World Order stuff, I'm gonna have a problem.
[01:57:59.054 --> 01:58:03.137]  Kissinger's been in the newspapers saying, we don't want boots on the ground in Syria.
[01:58:03.137 --> 01:58:06.599]  The globalism's falling apart, so a new system's coming in.
[01:58:07.654 --> 01:58:10.375]  I want a renaissance system, not a post-industrial system.
[01:58:10.375 --> 01:58:12.816]  The real debate with Trump and globalism is this.
[01:58:12.816 --> 01:58:20.399]  He wants a populist prosperity narrative of upward mobility, innovation, unlocking the secrets of the universe.
[01:58:20.399 --> 01:58:23.881]  The globalists want a two-tiered, breakaway civilization, and everybody else poor.
[01:58:23.881 --> 01:58:25.281]  But I'm going to come back to you in a minute.
[01:58:25.281 --> 01:58:26.341]  Snyder, take a shot to break.
[01:58:26.341 --> 01:58:27.322]  Any comments on what he just said?
[01:58:28.736 --> 01:58:29.396]  Oh, I agree.
[01:58:29.396 --> 01:58:30.977]  I think a lot of people misunderstand Trump.
[01:58:30.977 --> 01:58:32.778]  We need to stand with President Trump.
[01:58:32.778 --> 01:58:34.439]  We need to fight the globalists.
[01:58:34.439 --> 01:58:36.540]  We need to get him as much help as possible.
[01:58:36.540 --> 01:58:39.342]  But he's going to meet with the Chinese, the Russians, Kissinger.
[01:58:39.342 --> 01:58:40.042]  It's going to happen.
[01:58:40.042 --> 01:58:41.643]  But I'm going to come back to you, Scott.
[01:58:41.643 --> 01:58:45.585]  And then we're going to go to Mike and Zachary and Jason and Laureen and others.
[01:58:45.585 --> 01:58:46.025]  Stay with us.
[01:58:50.820 --> 01:58:56.283]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:58:56.283 --> 01:58:58.364]  Research across the board is clear.
[01:58:58.364 --> 01:59:03.667]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[01:59:03.667 --> 01:59:07.409]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that
[01:59:07.509 --> 01:59:10.952]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[01:59:10.952 --> 01:59:14.134]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[01:59:14.134 --> 01:59:18.018]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[01:59:18.018 --> 01:59:25.183]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[01:59:25.183 --> 01:59:30.588]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[01:59:30.748 --> 01:59:31.988]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:11.835 --> 02:00:17.365]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[02:00:17.365 --> 02:00:20.050]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:25.510 --> 02:00:26.991]  Scott is our guest.
[02:00:26.991 --> 02:00:30.172]  We have the man, basically, verbally attacked.
[02:00:30.172 --> 02:00:31.292]  The lady said I should be killed.
[02:00:31.292 --> 02:00:32.553]  It's on video.
[02:00:32.553 --> 02:00:39.295]  He's going to be joining us, talking about what it's like to be on the streets of New Orleans, playing the InfoWars show live so folks can hear it.
[02:00:39.295 --> 02:00:47.579]  We also have Dr. Corsi popping in with the fact that the White House says they're going to go after Obama for stealing the Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac $300 billion for Obamacare.
[02:00:47.579 --> 02:00:48.399]  So very, very exciting.
[02:00:48.399 --> 02:00:49.699]  We've been on the tip of the spear there.
[02:00:49.699 --> 02:00:50.520]  Scott in Vermont.
[02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:52.282]  Trump's not perfect.
[02:00:52.282 --> 02:00:53.424]  He's done some things that are wrong.
[02:00:53.424 --> 02:00:54.645]  We're here saying it.
[02:00:54.645 --> 02:00:56.569]  Overall, though, a lot of good things he's doing.
[02:00:56.569 --> 02:00:59.253]  A good Supreme Court judge is a lot of other stuff.
[02:00:59.253 --> 02:01:00.835]  So that's why I'm supporting him.
[02:01:00.835 --> 02:01:03.099]  But absolutely, I don't like a lot of what I'm seeing.
[02:01:03.099 --> 02:01:03.480]  What do you think?
[02:01:05.134 --> 02:01:13.202]  Alex, Henry Kissinger is just as much a war criminal as George Soros, and he's trilateral commission CFR for years.
[02:01:13.202 --> 02:01:24.232]  I would like to hear Trump say, use the term new old order in a negative fashion like in 1996 Pat Buchanan said, elect me president and the new old order will come crashing down.
[02:01:24.232 --> 02:01:29.737]  That phrase could be taken two ways, Pat's a member of the Knights of Malta, but anyways, at least it sounded good.
[02:01:30.678 --> 02:01:47.672]  I'd like to hear Trump denounce, admit the fact that these people, these globalists, have been pushing for their New World Order agenda for many years, and people like Henry Kissinger, you know, and the Bible says, Ephesians 5.11, it says, have no fellowship with the unfulfilled works of darkness and iniquity.
[02:01:47.672 --> 02:01:48.592]  Don't be hanging around with them.
[02:01:48.592 --> 02:01:51.314]  Don't be taking advice from them, you know, people like Kissinger.
[02:01:51.314 --> 02:01:53.817]  Listen, we elected a president, though, not some priest.
[02:01:54.397 --> 02:01:58.362]  Because, I mean, obviously if it was like some school teacher, we wouldn't want her hanging around with Henry Kissinger.
[02:01:58.362 --> 02:02:03.367]  This is who... Trump said he'd talk to Kim Jong-un, and he said that during the campaign, but I hear what you're saying.
[02:02:03.367 --> 02:02:04.669]  Now let's go back to this Knights of Malta thing.
[02:02:06.141 --> 02:02:08.962]  The average person in the Knights of Malta is involved in kids' charities.
[02:02:08.962 --> 02:02:09.622]  I'm not Catholic.
[02:02:09.622 --> 02:02:10.682]  It's just a fact.
[02:02:10.682 --> 02:02:12.723]  Most conservative Catholics hate the new Pope.
[02:02:12.723 --> 02:02:14.203]  They're at war with him.
[02:02:14.203 --> 02:02:20.885]  So I think just saying that Catholics all support what the Jesuits are doing or something just isn't fair.
[02:02:20.885 --> 02:02:23.926]  Get the judge, Pat Buchanan, on the history of what he's done.
[02:02:23.926 --> 02:02:27.167]  So much of our movement right now to fight tyranny is because of Pat Buchanan.
[02:02:27.167 --> 02:02:30.587]  So I think it's kind of a cheap shot to go, oh, he's in the Knights of Malta.
[02:02:30.587 --> 02:02:32.448]  He's critical of this horrible Pope, isn't he?
[02:02:34.628 --> 02:02:38.570]  Pat Buchanan put down the Federal Reserve like Ron Paul did.
[02:02:38.570 --> 02:02:41.111]  Back in 1996, I asked Pat about that.
[02:02:41.111 --> 02:02:45.593]  When he was on a radio show, I was going to ask him either about his members of the Knights of Malta or the Federal Reserve.
[02:02:45.593 --> 02:02:50.275]  I asked him about the Federal Reserve, and I wanted him to say something, you know, that is unconstitutional.
[02:02:50.275 --> 02:02:57.819]  It's a Ponzi scheme, you know, that we need to do away with it and get back to constitutional money, just like we need to not have unconstitutional wars anymore.
[02:02:57.819 --> 02:02:59.300]  We have unconstitutional money.
[02:02:59.300 --> 02:03:02.001]  But Pat Buchanan just kind of, you know, just mealy-mouthed it, you know?
[02:03:02.381 --> 02:03:09.767]  Sure, listen, listen, I mean, Pat McCann is an old guy, and he's not our enemy, and I'm going to move on from that, but I get your point.
[02:03:09.767 --> 02:03:11.328]  Let's go ahead and take one more call here.
[02:03:11.328 --> 02:03:13.190]  Let's go to Loreen.
[02:03:13.190 --> 02:03:14.931]  Loreen in Michigan.
[02:03:14.931 --> 02:03:15.952]  You're on the air, Loreen.
[02:03:15.952 --> 02:03:17.353]  Go ahead.
[02:03:17.353 --> 02:03:19.215]  It's nice to talk to you, Alex.
[02:03:19.215 --> 02:03:22.557]  I've listened to you ever since you first came on the radio.
[02:03:22.557 --> 02:03:24.179]  Thank you.
[02:03:24.179 --> 02:03:28.102]  The thing that I was calling you about is Brzezinski.
[02:03:29.344 --> 02:03:37.291]  I heard him one time not too terribly long ago say Russia was too big and they had to split it up.
[02:03:37.291 --> 02:03:39.293]  Oh yeah, he says that he wants Russia to fall.
[02:03:39.293 --> 02:03:43.416]  He's absolutely obsessed with the destruction of Russia.
[02:03:43.416 --> 02:03:45.258]  That's exactly what I figured.
[02:03:46.257 --> 02:03:50.298]  Yeah, and then Russia's just supposed to put up with him and George Soros trying to overthrow Russia.
[02:03:50.298 --> 02:03:53.779]  Kissinger actually does not want to overthrow Russia and wants to work with them.
[02:03:53.779 --> 02:03:57.160]  I'm not saying Kissinger's a good guy, but there's different power players.
[02:03:57.160 --> 02:04:01.502]  I'm going to hold you over, man, to give you more time, do a little bit more with Snyder, then we'll go to our next guest.
[02:04:01.502 --> 02:04:05.263]  We'll go to him in about five minutes after break, but Michael, you want to comment on what she's saying there?
[02:04:06.534 --> 02:04:07.074]  Oh, I agree.
[02:04:07.074 --> 02:04:09.155]  These New World Order types, they're still active.
[02:04:09.155 --> 02:04:11.036]  They still are trying to get their way.
[02:04:11.036 --> 02:04:12.736]  And that's why we need to expose them.
[02:04:12.736 --> 02:04:16.298]  And that's one of the reasons we need to raise up.
[02:04:16.298 --> 02:04:20.239]  We need people who are going to be bold, will not back down, will not be ashamed.
[02:04:20.239 --> 02:04:27.582]  For example, if I potentially won and went to Congress, I would denounce the New World Order from the floor of the U.S.
[02:04:27.582 --> 02:04:28.862]  House of Representatives.
[02:04:28.862 --> 02:04:31.804]  I would say we need to shut down the Federal Reserve from the floor of the U.S.
[02:04:31.804 --> 02:04:32.724]  House of Representatives.
[02:04:33.064 --> 02:04:43.351]  We need to be bold, we need to take a stand, and we need to take our government back, and we need to go after these globalists with every method we have.
[02:04:43.351 --> 02:04:44.952]  Well, I totally agree with you.
[02:04:44.952 --> 02:04:45.893]  Lorraine, you got more to add?
[02:04:45.893 --> 02:04:48.215]  We'll come back to you, or do you want to go?
[02:04:48.215 --> 02:04:53.398]  No, that's what I wanted to say, but I'm so happy that you're on the radio, and I'm so glad Trump got in.
[02:04:53.398 --> 02:04:54.479]  Well, thank you, your sweetheart.
[02:04:54.479 --> 02:04:56.060]  I love that lady's voice.
[02:04:56.060 --> 02:04:59.182]  We'll be right back with Mike, Zachary, Matt, and Jason, then our next guest.
[02:04:59.182 --> 02:04:59.563]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.708 --> 02:05:04.291]  So today I want to talk about killing white people in context.
[02:05:04.291 --> 02:05:15.542]  A Texas A&M professor says that some white people may have to die in order to solve racism and bring about true equality.
[02:05:15.542 --> 02:05:20.566]  When we have this conversation about violence or killing white people, it has to be looked at in this historical term.
[02:05:20.566 --> 02:05:26.692]  And the fact that we've had no one address how relevant and how solidified this kind of tradition is for black people saying,
[02:05:26.852 --> 02:05:31.415]  Look, in order to be equal, in order to be liberated, some white people may have to die.
[02:05:56.992 --> 02:06:00.514]  And you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:06:00.514 --> 02:06:05.918]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:06:05.918 --> 02:06:08.779]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[02:06:08.779 --> 02:06:10.761]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[02:06:10.761 --> 02:06:15.784]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[02:06:15.784 --> 02:06:17.865]  Research across the board is clear.
[02:06:17.865 --> 02:06:19.166]  In fact, it's certified.
[02:06:19.166 --> 02:06:24.089]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[02:06:24.269 --> 02:06:31.152]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[02:06:31.152 --> 02:06:34.134]  Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[02:06:34.134 --> 02:06:37.836]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[02:06:37.836 --> 02:06:44.739]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[02:06:44.739 --> 02:06:50.642]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine,
[02:06:50.882 --> 02:06:52.383]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[02:06:52.383 --> 02:06:54.685]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[02:06:54.685 --> 02:06:55.626]  It's the air we're breathing.
[02:06:55.626 --> 02:06:56.386]  Especially for our children.
[02:06:56.386 --> 02:06:57.587]  The artificial particulates.
[02:06:57.587 --> 02:06:58.068]  The chemicals.
[02:07:10.077 --> 02:07:13.218]  is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:07:13.218 --> 02:07:22.422]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking Water Filtration Systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[02:07:22.422 --> 02:07:29.945]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[02:07:29.945 --> 02:07:37.968]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[02:07:37.968 --> 02:07:38.929]  The general public doesn't.
[02:07:40.166 --> 02:07:44.087]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:07:44.087 --> 02:07:47.668]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:07:47.668 --> 02:07:54.369]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:07:54.369 --> 02:08:06.811]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infowarestore.com.
[02:08:06.811 --> 02:08:09.772]  America is rising from the ashes, if we wanted to.
[02:08:14.867 --> 02:08:17.509]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:17.509 --> 02:08:23.974]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:08:23.974 --> 02:08:40.187]  I was born in the soul of misery And I never had me a name They just give me a number
[02:08:42.054 --> 02:08:47.497]  To have microchip identification devices implanted into their body.
[02:08:47.497 --> 02:08:55.521]  Got a long line of heartache, I carry it well.
[02:08:55.521 --> 02:08:59.644]  The list of lives I've broken reach from here to hell.
[02:09:04.497 --> 02:09:18.351]  Take a few more phone calls and let our guest Michael Snyder go, then continue with calls and clips, and then of course, get Dr. Jerome Corsi on, who's breaking big news story after big story.
[02:09:18.351 --> 02:09:28.881]  I've been very frustrated, but also very, very pleased, kind of bittersweet, that Corsi's articles are directly from the White House and Congress.
[02:09:30.302 --> 02:09:37.485]  I mean we get congressmen on who've been on the Russian probes and say it's all the Democrats and they're angry that nothing's being done and then no coverage.
[02:09:37.485 --> 02:09:44.168]  But it's watched by the agencies, by the FBI, and others.
[02:09:44.168 --> 02:09:54.213]  That's why Comey was so unpopular is the FBI actually knows how bad he is and it's a bunch of Democrats up there at the top saying Trump's crazy, there's no spying of the president, there's no leaking, it's all pure bull.
[02:09:54.213 --> 02:09:55.053]  Comey's been exposed.
[02:09:56.445 --> 02:10:00.946]  And now he's breaking that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac got $300 billion stolen by Obama.
[02:10:00.946 --> 02:10:02.127]  We broke that months ago.
[02:10:02.127 --> 02:10:04.968]  Last week, the Treasury Secretary came out and said it's true.
[02:10:04.968 --> 02:10:06.588]  We got credit.
[02:10:06.588 --> 02:10:07.368]  Of course we got credit.
[02:10:07.368 --> 02:10:08.729]  Who do you think it came from?
[02:10:08.729 --> 02:10:10.649]  They need us to bring it up first.
[02:10:10.649 --> 02:10:11.930]  And other media is giving this too.
[02:10:11.930 --> 02:10:14.511]  They're all too cowardly.
[02:10:14.511 --> 02:10:18.492]  You get an average newspaper editor to expose Obama stealing $300 trillion?
[02:10:18.492 --> 02:10:20.773]  Because he's a Democrat, they won't do it.
[02:10:20.773 --> 02:10:21.833]  It's a cult!
[02:10:23.351 --> 02:10:25.512]  If Trump did something like that, I'd speak out against it.
[02:10:25.512 --> 02:10:29.513]  Well, now Trump's trying to stop it.
[02:10:29.513 --> 02:10:34.375]  But a new one, flashback, Russia interfered to help Dems in the 1968-1984 elections.
[02:10:34.375 --> 02:10:44.998]  That was famous at the time, because the Democrats were ideology, in their ideology, aligned with the Russians, with the Communism.
[02:10:44.998 --> 02:10:51.460]  Now that they're Christian, now that they're more free market and reforming themselves, they've still got big problems, we do too, now they hate them!
[02:10:51.460 --> 02:10:52.761]  Hollywood hates them because they're Christian.
[02:10:55.819 --> 02:11:07.200]  So, I wanted to play this short clip and go back to calls here, and then go to our next guest, who's been under attack for the First Amendment, because this is so central.
[02:11:07.200 --> 02:11:07.721]  This is from RT.
[02:11:09.594 --> 02:11:09.834]  U.S.
[02:11:09.834 --> 02:11:16.316]  media pushes conspiracy theory, declares exclusion from Trump-Lavrov meeting, and they go, oh look, and the Russian ambassador's there.
[02:11:16.316 --> 02:11:18.337]  He's been implicated in meetings with people!
[02:11:18.337 --> 02:11:24.338]  And then you'll see Schumer go, it's true, I did meet with him 14 times.
[02:11:24.338 --> 02:11:27.299]  But the Attorney General and Senator met with him three.
[02:11:27.299 --> 02:11:31.500]  I want to know what's in those meetings.
[02:11:31.500 --> 02:11:35.562]  My name's Schumer.
[02:11:35.562 --> 02:11:36.862]  I've got a lot of bravado.
[02:11:39.625 --> 02:11:42.047]  And it's like, you met with him.
[02:11:42.047 --> 02:11:45.709]  The President met with him, and they could have put listening devices in.
[02:11:45.709 --> 02:11:49.232]  I mean, no one else goes, they've never said that with the Russians before.
[02:11:49.232 --> 02:11:54.256]  It's just, look, he's meeting, he's seeing, he's with the Russians, he caught talking to him.
[02:11:54.256 --> 02:11:57.298]  To the point with optics, he hasn't met with Putin yet.
[02:11:57.298 --> 02:11:59.820]  They're waiting till the G20 meeting.
[02:11:59.820 --> 02:12:01.221]  Russia's been kicked out of the G7.
[02:12:01.221 --> 02:12:03.522]  Now it's the G7 from G8.
[02:12:03.522 --> 02:12:06.825]  I mean, this is how you get paralyzed, and Trump's coming out of the paralyzation.
[02:12:08.837 --> 02:12:12.078]  He kind of bent over to him 40 days ago and said, OK, whatever.
[02:12:12.078 --> 02:12:13.819]  And then it went getting worse.
[02:12:13.819 --> 02:12:16.300]  Trump's going, wow, you guys don't want to work with me.
[02:12:16.300 --> 02:12:17.321]  You don't want to share power.
[02:12:17.321 --> 02:12:18.301]  You want to destroy me.
[02:12:18.301 --> 02:12:20.282]  Then let's have a fight, scum.
[02:12:20.282 --> 02:12:23.763]  And so it's up to us to back Trump because he's under attack.
[02:12:23.763 --> 02:12:25.084]  He's doing what we asked for.
[02:12:25.084 --> 02:12:25.824]  Is he perfect?
[02:12:25.824 --> 02:12:26.545]  No.
[02:12:26.545 --> 02:12:29.686]  But it's easy to look at the man in the arena and say, oh, he stumbled.
[02:12:31.530 --> 02:12:34.932]  When he's taking us light years against the globalists, because we took him light years.
[02:12:34.932 --> 02:12:35.993]  We're in this together.
[02:12:35.993 --> 02:12:42.818]  But here's the piece from RT with... Meanwhile, they had pool reporters in there.
[02:12:42.818 --> 02:12:45.580]  One White House, one pool reporter from the US, one from Russia.
[02:12:45.580 --> 02:12:46.441]  That's customary.
[02:12:46.441 --> 02:12:47.421]  But they know you don't know.
[02:12:47.421 --> 02:12:49.383]  That's like... Here it is.
[02:12:53.487 --> 02:12:54.347]  Members of the U.S.
[02:12:54.347 --> 02:13:05.713]  media are angry, claiming that they were not allowed into the meeting between President Trump and the Russian Foreign Minister, while the Russian media supposedly was there.
[02:13:05.713 --> 02:13:12.977]  It is outrageous that Russian media were allowed into the Oval Office, but American media were not.
[02:13:12.977 --> 02:13:13.517]  No U.S.
[02:13:13.517 --> 02:13:18.260]  press allowed in meeting with President Trump, so we have to rely on images from Russian state media.
[02:13:20.365 --> 02:13:24.730]  According to the White House, only two official photographers were actually president.
[02:13:24.730 --> 02:13:27.553]  One from the United States and one from the Russian side.
[02:13:27.553 --> 02:13:36.402]  This, however, did not stop outrage and conspiracy theories from spreading online with claims that Trump is concealing his dealings with Russia from American journalists.
[02:13:36.402 --> 02:13:38.244]  A Fox News presenter even went this far.
[02:13:40.052 --> 02:13:42.336]  There were photos taken by the Russians.
[02:13:42.336 --> 02:13:43.097]  They're online.
[02:13:43.097 --> 02:13:54.735]  We're choosing not to show them because as part of the press here in the United States, we think it's important that the press have access to official photos from the White House.
[02:13:55.942 --> 02:13:59.285]  We know that Donald Trump and the media hate each other.
[02:13:59.285 --> 02:14:02.828]  So, you know, the media is very clear about the fact that they hate Trump.
[02:14:02.828 --> 02:14:07.412]  Trump is very clear about the fact that he hates the media and so-called fake news.
[02:14:07.412 --> 02:14:09.994]  So, you know, there's no conspiracy here.
[02:14:09.994 --> 02:14:14.858]  You know, when you think about, for example, the White House press corps, they took great offense at the fact that...
[02:14:15.939 --> 02:14:16.820]  I don't know that
[02:14:36.733 --> 02:14:38.574]  All giant power trip.
[02:14:38.574 --> 02:14:44.175]  Michael Snyder, it is routine that after they have the press conference, they go back and then there's a couple photographers.
[02:14:44.175 --> 02:14:48.516]  When the Chinese were here, they had a photographer, we did.
[02:14:48.516 --> 02:14:50.857]  The media knows exactly how this works.
[02:14:50.857 --> 02:14:54.138]  So they sit there and decide, so no one gets in trouble.
[02:14:54.138 --> 02:14:56.899]  Because if only one reporter lied, then they'd get in trouble.
[02:14:56.899 --> 02:14:57.539]  They'd be known as a liar.
[02:14:57.539 --> 02:15:00.420]  But they all lie together, and then it's okay, Michael.
[02:15:02.290 --> 02:15:05.535]  Yeah, people need to understand the mainstream media cannot be trusted.
[02:15:05.535 --> 02:15:12.025]  It's propaganda and I love that Donald Trump is calling it fake news because they are the fake news and they hate Donald Trump.
[02:15:12.025 --> 02:15:13.026]  They're trying to destroy him.
[02:15:13.026 --> 02:15:16.572]  Don't you love how the New York Times and CNN says don't use that anymore because we use it on them?
[02:15:17.998 --> 02:15:19.219]  I know, I know.
[02:15:19.219 --> 02:15:22.242]  They were trying to put that label on us, but they're really the fake news.
[02:15:22.242 --> 02:15:24.223]  Now they don't like that label all of a sudden.
[02:15:24.223 --> 02:15:27.486]  But it's the troops that hit the beach first that take the most fire.
[02:15:27.486 --> 02:15:31.389]  And Donald Trump has created a beachhead for freedom, for liberty, and the government.
[02:15:31.389 --> 02:15:32.530]  Now we need to back him up.
[02:15:32.530 --> 02:15:36.373]  You know, it's easy to sit back and complain and say, ah, I don't like this, I don't like that.
[02:15:36.793 --> 02:15:44.295]  But you know, men of courage, when there's an opportunity, when there's a battle, when there's a fight, they step forward and they put themselves into it.
[02:15:44.295 --> 02:15:53.779]  So what we need, the rest of us need to start rushing the beach to support Donald Trump, to support freedom, to support liberty, to step up and maybe do some things that we never thought we would do, like I'm doing.
[02:15:53.779 --> 02:15:58.280]  You know, I encourage others all over this country, what can you do for the cause of freedom and liberty?
[02:15:58.280 --> 02:16:01.141]  Stop complaining and arguing and pointing the fingers.
[02:16:02.022 --> 02:16:04.929]  Maybe think about what you can do to advance the cause.
[02:16:04.929 --> 02:16:05.490]  That's right.
[02:16:05.490 --> 02:16:06.592]  Now, again, Michael Snyder.
[02:16:06.592 --> 02:16:07.996]  We'll talk to you again very, very soon.
[02:16:07.996 --> 02:16:09.198]  EconomicCollapseBlog.com.
[02:16:09.198 --> 02:16:09.780]  Thank you so much.
[02:16:09.780 --> 02:16:11.824]  Glad you're looking and running for Congress.
[02:16:12.790 --> 02:16:13.390]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:16:43.584 --> 02:16:47.005]  Obama isn't spying on you either, even though he publicly admitted he was.
[02:16:47.005 --> 02:16:47.726]  Nothing's happening.
[02:16:47.726 --> 02:16:49.366]  Nothing to see or go away.
[02:16:49.366 --> 02:16:50.427]  Obamacare's free.
[02:16:50.427 --> 02:16:52.207]  Blah, blah, blah.
[02:16:52.207 --> 02:17:00.671]  So it's the standard load of baloney.
[02:17:00.671 --> 02:17:03.472]  It's the standard manipulation they put out, hoping you're stupid.
[02:17:05.046 --> 02:17:20.152]  But now he's got a new executive order today, May 11th, 2017, to re-establish, because they've had these probes before, but a new probe of election fraud in the United States to rub it into the media's face.
[02:17:20.152 --> 02:17:21.673]  This is big news.
[02:17:21.673 --> 02:17:25.415]  It's very, very exciting.
[02:17:25.415 --> 02:17:27.355]  Now joining us is Michael DiBari.
[02:17:27.355 --> 02:17:29.796]  We're going to come back in the next segment and actually play a clip of it.
[02:17:29.796 --> 02:17:31.077]  It's been bleeped.
[02:17:31.077 --> 02:17:33.378]  He's an activist of the 60s with the free speech movement.
[02:17:34.673 --> 02:17:36.694]  Yeah, that's what woke me up when I was a teenager.
[02:17:53.942 --> 02:18:01.485]  He got back into the act was about 9-11 and worked as a writer and political cartoonist for the New Orleans Monthly called the New Orleans Levy Newspaper.
[02:18:01.485 --> 02:18:02.925]  He won't hold back anything.
[02:18:02.925 --> 02:18:06.726]  A political satirical rag that got up to 80 to 100,000 readers.
[02:18:06.726 --> 02:18:11.008]  BadassUncleSam.com is his website.
[02:18:11.008 --> 02:18:13.789]  Before we get into what happened to him, we played some of this last week, it went viral.
[02:18:14.935 --> 02:18:16.316]  Well, it's a pleasure to be with you, Alex.
[02:18:16.316 --> 02:18:16.616]  Pleasure.
[02:18:16.616 --> 02:18:21.179]  I'd like to, before I start, I'd like to thank God for the opportunity to be what I'm doing and doing what I'm doing.
[02:18:21.179 --> 02:18:22.480]  I want to thank you.
[02:18:22.480 --> 02:18:23.100]  You can see behind me the
[02:18:46.144 --> 02:18:47.445]  Caveman.
[02:18:47.445 --> 02:18:49.185]  That's my pharmacy back there.
[02:18:49.185 --> 02:18:51.326]  That's you.
[02:18:51.326 --> 02:18:55.808]  I couldn't be doing what I'm doing at my age if it wasn't for that stuff.
[02:18:55.808 --> 02:18:56.408]  Caveman.
[02:18:56.408 --> 02:19:00.190]  Well, thanks for the support.
[02:19:00.190 --> 02:19:02.791]  I like the fact that you're a First Amendment advocate.
[02:19:02.791 --> 02:19:08.893]  We've only got about a minute until bright, but just tell folks what you do in New Orleans.
[02:19:08.893 --> 02:19:10.914]  Basically, what I'm doing is I
[02:19:11.983 --> 02:19:16.887]  Take my artwork and take your work and I put it out on the street.
[02:19:16.887 --> 02:19:24.072]  It's a beautiful place for it because you never know you're going to reach people that you wouldn't normally be able to reach.
[02:19:24.072 --> 02:19:28.216]  And I've had the opportunity to meet people out there that I never would have been able to meet.
[02:19:28.216 --> 02:19:35.541]  I've met David Knight out there, Kit Daniels, Professor Iris Mack, who you have had on your show.
[02:19:35.541 --> 02:19:38.924]  She comes out and is a regular, hangs out, loves to talk to the people.
[02:19:39.933 --> 02:19:43.275]  Educates them on what the Federal Reserve has done to us.
[02:19:43.275 --> 02:19:49.899]  Of course, she has first-hand knowledge of all the things that Larry Summers did and went on.
[02:19:49.899 --> 02:19:50.459]  All these should...
[02:20:00.925 --> 02:20:04.767]  We use cell phones against our heads every day, but now a landmark U.S.

[02:24:05.354 --> 02:24:11.739]  Coming up, a little bit later in the next segment, I'll finish with your calls and I'll get to ABC Cancel's Tim Allen's highly rated TV show.
[02:24:11.739 --> 02:24:23.309]  Two months after he called out hysterical anti-Trump left saying, look, not against gay people, and they've got their free speech, but you go to a gay parade, it's a bunch of naked dudes swinging their, you know, what's around.
[02:24:23.309 --> 02:24:25.511]  So, don't put it through a neighborhood.
[02:24:26.513 --> 02:24:31.015]  But then meanwhile the left's all for that, but then they'll come say, I want to take Alex Jones out.
[02:24:31.015 --> 02:24:35.078]  I think he should be killed, because my son listens to him and he's brainwashed.
[02:24:35.078 --> 02:24:36.278]  What are you brainwashed by?
[02:24:36.278 --> 02:24:42.421]  I show you Obama admittedly wiretapping Trump, then he says he never did it, then come he says he's crazy.
[02:24:42.421 --> 02:24:46.704]  All we do is remind you of Gruber going, you're dumb!
[02:24:46.704 --> 02:24:48.365]  Ha ha!
[02:24:48.365 --> 02:24:50.946]  And then he's out again saying Obamacare is because of Trump.
[02:24:52.742 --> 02:24:55.003]  They're the ones that are lying to you.
[02:24:55.003 --> 02:24:58.685]  We're not brainwashing anybody.
[02:24:58.685 --> 02:25:01.627]  Brainwashing people is saying there shouldn't be free speech.
[02:25:01.627 --> 02:25:04.269]  Brainwashing people is saying you didn't build your business.
[02:25:04.269 --> 02:25:09.652]  Brainwashing people is saying Venezuela and Cuba and China are great countries.
[02:25:09.652 --> 02:25:14.454]  Our guest will be with us a little bit in the next segment of your phone calls, Michael Dabari, BadassUncleSam.com.
[02:25:15.967 --> 02:25:17.508]  This is a shorter segment.
[02:25:17.508 --> 02:25:18.289]  Introduce this video.
[02:25:18.289 --> 02:25:19.669]  I'm not going to play it all.
[02:25:19.669 --> 02:25:21.991]  She's got her big husband.
[02:25:21.991 --> 02:25:23.112]  Looks like 6'7 or something.
[02:25:23.112 --> 02:25:24.953]  She's got a small guy in your face.
[02:25:24.953 --> 02:25:25.814]  You say, hey, back off.
[02:25:25.814 --> 02:25:26.994]  She's the one saying kill people.
[02:25:26.994 --> 02:25:29.336]  And then she's like, why are you being so mean?
[02:25:29.336 --> 02:25:30.657]  She talks in an NPR voice.
[02:25:30.657 --> 02:25:32.378]  I love how you talk to her back in it.
[02:25:32.378 --> 02:25:33.339]  Oh, how dare you?
[02:25:33.339 --> 02:25:35.480]  I'm here to cuck you and make you bow to me.
[02:25:35.480 --> 02:25:37.261]  And I just want to kill people.
[02:25:37.261 --> 02:25:38.142]  What's wrong?
[02:25:38.142 --> 02:25:39.062]  She's so hateful.
[02:25:39.062 --> 02:25:40.063]  I just want to kill.
[02:25:40.063 --> 02:25:41.804]  I just want to kill.
[02:25:41.804 --> 02:25:45.086]  I just want to kill Alex Jones.
[02:25:45.086 --> 02:25:45.807]  Set this up for us.
[02:25:49.450 --> 02:25:54.755]  I always, of course, try to break the ice by asking people where they're from and what they do.
[02:25:54.755 --> 02:26:09.688]  And to be honest with you, I can't remember much of that conversation leading up to the point where the woman looked up at the InfoWars sticker and she goes, Oh, you listen to that guy?
[02:26:09.688 --> 02:26:12.311]  And then she went off on her tangent and
[02:26:13.843 --> 02:26:16.425]  Well, my anger meter shot up to about 11.
[02:26:16.425 --> 02:26:19.968]  And that's where it took off from there.
[02:26:19.968 --> 02:26:27.694]  Also, I remember from the conversation for that is they told me that she said she was in California and there was a, you know, she had something to do with the school.
[02:26:27.694 --> 02:26:29.715]  She was a teacher.
[02:26:29.715 --> 02:26:31.036]  And is that when you started the recording?
[02:26:31.036 --> 02:26:33.978]  Because we basically see it from then.
[02:26:33.978 --> 02:26:34.339]  Yes.
[02:26:34.339 --> 02:26:34.859]  Yeah.
[02:26:34.859 --> 02:26:36.380]  Because I have the remote controls.
[02:26:36.380 --> 02:26:38.802]  I don't have a camera.
[02:26:38.802 --> 02:26:39.743]  I keep on all the time.
[02:26:39.743 --> 02:26:41.244]  I don't have the battery space for it.
[02:26:41.926 --> 02:26:49.988]  So I have remote controls attached to my belt, so when a conversation starts getting interesting, I can go ahead and hit those buttons and start recording.
[02:26:49.988 --> 02:26:52.169]  You've got a YouTube channel where folks can see more of these.
[02:26:52.169 --> 02:26:54.210]  I'll give them the YouTube channel.
[02:26:54.210 --> 02:26:55.610]  Oh, God, yes.
[02:26:55.610 --> 02:26:56.430]  What is that, Antoine?
[02:26:56.430 --> 02:26:58.731]  What's the YouTube channel now?
[02:26:58.731 --> 02:27:01.111]  It's the same one.
[02:27:01.111 --> 02:27:01.792]  It's the same one.
[02:27:01.792 --> 02:27:04.772]  It's called My Name is Michael DeBerry.
[02:27:04.772 --> 02:27:07.573]  It's The Mr. Kodo is what it's under.
[02:27:07.573 --> 02:27:09.334]  Let's start going to some of the tape.
[02:27:10.515 --> 02:27:20.766]  Again, we'll kind of boost her audio because she's not close to the microphone, but here's a lady totally calm and totally normal, and she doesn't know why you're upset that she just wants to kill people like we're in, you know, Nazi Germany.
[02:27:20.766 --> 02:27:21.147]  Here it is.
[02:27:23.154 --> 02:27:27.256]  You're saying someone that gets up there and speaks, you want to kill them.
[02:27:27.256 --> 02:27:28.396]  Is that what you're saying?
[02:27:28.396 --> 02:27:29.957]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:27:29.957 --> 02:27:31.457]  No, you authoritative bastard.
[02:27:31.457 --> 02:27:32.638]  Stay right here.
[02:27:32.638 --> 02:27:35.699]  I have nowhere to vent what I have to say.
[02:27:35.699 --> 02:27:38.620]  Let me do it here because it doesn't matter.
[02:27:38.620 --> 02:27:40.180]  Alex Jones needs to be killed.
[02:27:40.180 --> 02:27:40.961]  Is that what you're saying?
[02:27:40.961 --> 02:27:41.881]  Yeah, I am.
[02:27:41.881 --> 02:27:44.582]  So please, what do you got against free speech?
[02:27:44.582 --> 02:27:46.983]  What do you got against free speech, lady?
[02:27:46.983 --> 02:27:50.664]  This is totally different than what you think.
[02:27:53.606 --> 02:27:58.568]  Okay, I want Alex Jones to be taken out for brainwashing.
[02:27:58.568 --> 02:28:01.269]  Not free speech, I believe in free speech.
[02:28:01.269 --> 02:28:05.350]  We were just doing, we were speaking freely and we're doing it right now.
[02:28:05.350 --> 02:28:14.092]  You just say you wanna stop someone who has a news program, millions of people listen to you, and you wanna go ahead and eliminate his brain?
[02:28:14.092 --> 02:28:15.913]  You wanna get him killed?
[02:28:15.913 --> 02:28:16.933]  You wanna basically
[02:28:17.273 --> 02:28:18.994]  You want to eliminate free speech?
[02:28:18.994 --> 02:28:25.915]  How do you say you support free speech and at the same time want to stop someone from practicing it?
[02:28:25.915 --> 02:28:32.397]  Would you please tell me how you hold those two thoughts in your head and get justified?
[02:28:32.397 --> 02:28:34.558]  He's getting very aggressive.
[02:28:34.558 --> 02:28:39.679]  When someone does something against my First Amendment, you better believe I'm going to get aggressive.
[02:28:39.679 --> 02:28:42.840]  Now you tell me how in the hell you justify
[02:28:44.420 --> 02:28:57.169]  I love how she's been saying, kill me, kill me, he turns the tape on, she says it two more times, she wants to be taken out, yes she wants to be dead, and then her big husband starts grabbing on her going, come on, don't do it, he's brainwashed.
[02:28:57.169 --> 02:29:11.740]  No, someone's calmly saying they want to kill someone for no reason but their speech, and then you're brainwashed for being threatened by that, like the number one evil is someone wanting to kill somebody for their speech.
[02:29:11.740 --> 02:29:12.400]  All the time.
[02:29:16.219 --> 02:29:18.200]  I found a court on June 14th.
[02:29:18.200 --> 02:29:22.361]  There was a woman came out, protested me for over four hours.
[02:29:22.361 --> 02:29:26.423]  I held a sign up saying, this man promotes violence.
[02:29:26.423 --> 02:29:27.823]  New Orleans doesn't.
[02:29:27.823 --> 02:29:33.925]  I was subjected to more violence, threats, in that four hours than I have in four years or five years I've been doing this.
[02:29:33.925 --> 02:29:37.026]  I remember one guy tried to run me over with a scooter.
[02:29:37.026 --> 02:29:39.547]  One guy had to be held back from trying to attack me.
[02:29:39.547 --> 02:29:43.388]  One guy wanted to say he wanted to choke me to death.
[02:29:43.388 --> 02:29:44.729]  One guy wanted to beat me to death.
[02:29:45.544 --> 02:29:49.592]  At the end of the day... Hold on, hold on, let's come right back.
[02:29:49.592 --> 02:29:53.780]  What you go through, and is it mainly leftists?
[02:29:53.780 --> 02:29:56.485]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.862 --> 02:30:05.645]  Last week, a study was released showing the differences between vaccinated kids and non-vaccinated kids.
[02:30:05.645 --> 02:30:11.129]  Infowars.com covered this, pointing out the pushback of these studies being censored, while more pushback has begun.
[02:30:11.129 --> 02:30:18.654]  The Boston Herald published an editorial from the entire editorial staff, which is now calling for anyone pushing anti-vaccine rhetoric to be hung.
[02:30:18.654 --> 02:30:20.435]  The well-written legal-speak quote is,
[02:30:30.802 --> 02:30:31.762]  I don't think so.
[02:31:00.592 --> 02:31:04.593]  A new shipment of Bio-True Selenium is now available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:04.593 --> 02:31:06.054]  We've been sold out for months.
[02:31:06.054 --> 02:31:11.116]  Our one-of-a-kind Infowarslife Bio-True Selenium formula is now back in stock at Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:11.116 --> 02:31:15.277]  This is the true selenium formula that has rocked the nutraceutical industry to its core.
[02:31:15.277 --> 02:31:19.799]  Nearly every other selenium supplement on the market is produced with synthetic selenium.
[02:31:19.799 --> 02:31:24.921]  But Bio-True Selenium is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[02:31:24.921 --> 02:31:27.602]  The effects of the essential trace mineral selenium are
[02:31:27.742 --> 02:31:28.843]  We're good to go.
[02:31:54.620 --> 02:31:56.683]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight.
[02:31:56.683 --> 02:31:58.185]  This is the time to support InfoWars.
[02:31:58.185 --> 02:32:00.589]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:32:00.589 --> 02:32:02.431]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[02:32:02.431 --> 02:32:09.041]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[02:32:09.041 --> 02:32:10.503]  We are now introducing cavemen.
[02:32:10.563 --> 02:32:10.903]  Caveman.
[02:32:10.903 --> 02:32:14.084]  It's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[02:32:14.084 --> 02:32:16.204]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[02:32:30.288 --> 02:32:33.450]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[02:32:33.450 --> 02:32:38.594]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[02:32:38.594 --> 02:32:46.659]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors, to the marrow that produces the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[02:32:46.659 --> 02:32:54.565]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[02:32:54.565 --> 02:32:59.328]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman Ultimate Paleo Formula for yourself and 4WarsLife.com today.
[02:33:11.289 --> 02:33:15.852]  Live from the InfoHorse.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:15.852 --> 02:33:22.697]  I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing till they got a hold of me.
[02:33:22.697 --> 02:33:27.700]  I opened doors for little old ladies.
[02:33:27.700 --> 02:33:31.743]  I helped the blind to see.
[02:33:31.743 --> 02:33:35.945]  I got no friends cause they read the papers.
[02:33:35.945 --> 02:33:36.866]  They can't be seen.
[02:33:41.165 --> 02:33:49.278]  Here's more of the lady a few weeks ago, just par for the course, Democrats, Liberals, coming up and saying they want to kill me or kill anybody else that's conservative.
[02:33:49.278 --> 02:33:50.039]  And Mr. DeBerry...
[02:33:51.516 --> 02:33:52.656]  BadassUncleSam.com.
[02:33:52.656 --> 02:33:53.536]  He's been out there for years.
[02:33:53.536 --> 02:33:55.117]  I mean, he's been a listener, I don't know, for like a decade.
[02:33:55.117 --> 02:33:56.517]  I don't know, for at least five, six years.
[02:33:56.517 --> 02:33:58.458]  I've seen videos of him with his bike.
[02:33:58.458 --> 02:34:01.538]  He pulls a TV along behind it playing my show.
[02:34:01.538 --> 02:34:04.539]  He was just getting into people coming up, threatening him, you name it.
[02:34:04.539 --> 02:34:05.839]  But here's some more of her.
[02:34:05.839 --> 02:34:07.900]  If you just joined us, she just said she wants to be dead.
[02:34:07.900 --> 02:34:09.000]  She wants to be taken out.
[02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:10.020]  She wants to be killed.
[02:34:10.020 --> 02:34:13.381]  She goes, free speech is fine, but what he does isn't free speech.
[02:34:13.381 --> 02:34:15.902]  Which all I'm doing is showing you what she said.
[02:34:15.902 --> 02:34:16.842]  I don't think she should be killed.
[02:34:18.086 --> 02:34:19.947]  So it's beyond brainwashing, wanting me dead.
[02:34:19.947 --> 02:34:30.715]  And during the break, we had a news piece played from Owen Schroyer I hadn't even heard about, where major writers in major universities are calling for people that don't vaccinate to be killed.
[02:34:30.715 --> 02:34:31.976]  To be hung.
[02:34:31.976 --> 02:34:34.678]  So maybe if Owen can run in here, he can give us more on that story.
[02:34:34.678 --> 02:34:36.039]  I mean, it's just this violence.
[02:34:36.039 --> 02:34:36.939]  Kill Trump.
[02:34:36.939 --> 02:34:38.701]  Kill us.
[02:34:38.701 --> 02:34:41.463]  They got this black professor at A&M saying kill white people.
[02:34:42.592 --> 02:34:44.392]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:34:44.392 --> 02:34:45.493]  It's just crazy.
[02:34:45.493 --> 02:34:46.693]  Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[02:34:46.693 --> 02:34:59.556]  As they're trying to get whipped up into this position to kill people, don't you get that after you said kill us, even though you're bigger than he is and he's older than you, Mr. DeBerry stood up to you, Owens, at lunch.
[02:34:59.556 --> 02:35:02.717]  But maybe we can find the article he's talking about because that's just crazy.
[02:35:02.717 --> 02:35:04.217]  So let's go ahead and play some more of this clip.
[02:35:05.967 --> 02:35:09.548]  Against my first amendment, you better believe I'm going to get aggressive.
[02:35:09.548 --> 02:35:15.271]  Now you tell me, how in the hell do you justify- No, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, Andres.
[02:35:15.271 --> 02:35:17.591]  You're talking about free speech.
[02:35:17.591 --> 02:35:17.812]  Yes.
[02:35:17.812 --> 02:35:19.672]  And I'm speaking freely to you.
[02:35:19.672 --> 02:35:22.413]  Are you going to listen to what I'm saying?
[02:35:22.413 --> 02:35:26.515]  Of course, I want to hear you qualify what you just said.
[02:35:26.515 --> 02:35:28.155]  I want you to hear it.
[02:35:28.155 --> 02:35:34.418]  And it doesn't matter because you're a stranger to me and I speak to both of you about this.
[02:35:35.498 --> 02:35:40.741]  My son is completely brainwashed by this-.
[02:35:40.741 --> 02:35:42.862]  And so you want to kill him?
[02:35:42.862 --> 02:35:47.364]  Rather than listen to what the man has to say, maybe you're saying something that makes sense.
[02:35:47.364 --> 02:35:49.025]  And maybe your son is right.
[02:35:49.025 --> 02:35:51.266]  You want to kill free speech.
[02:35:51.266 --> 02:35:54.127]  You don't even give your son credit to have his own mind.
[02:35:54.127 --> 02:35:55.408]  You are that bad.
[02:35:55.408 --> 02:35:58.909]  You don't give a **** about your son or anybody else, lady.
[02:35:58.909 --> 02:36:00.290]  All you care about is-.
[02:36:00.290 --> 02:36:02.091]  Shut up.
[02:36:02.091 --> 02:36:02.811]  Or what?
[02:36:02.811 --> 02:36:03.612]  Or what, you mother******?
[02:36:04.412 --> 02:36:05.033]  Or what?
[02:36:05.033 --> 02:36:06.134]  Or what?
[02:36:06.134 --> 02:36:09.816]  I'm not at all affected by your upset.
[02:36:09.816 --> 02:36:14.160]  And you're not all affected by my being upset.
[02:36:14.160 --> 02:36:16.342]  I think you're the brain damaged one, lady.
[02:36:16.342 --> 02:36:19.744]  You're the one that's pissing all over the First Amendment.
[02:36:19.744 --> 02:36:22.887]  You better seek help.
[02:36:28.464 --> 02:36:29.525]  See what goes on?
[02:36:29.525 --> 02:36:31.748]  What, the free speech that you want to kill?
[02:36:31.748 --> 02:36:35.092]  I suppose you're all for that Berkley riot.
[02:36:35.092 --> 02:36:36.213]  For them stopping it.
[02:36:36.213 --> 02:36:37.735]  Walter, is she dead too?
[02:36:37.735 --> 02:36:38.476]  Should we tell her?
[02:36:38.476 --> 02:36:40.058]  How about Milo, the comedian?
[02:36:40.058 --> 02:36:43.542]  No, Andresa wants to give me the fine speech.
[02:36:43.542 --> 02:36:45.124]  They stopped in Berkley too.
[02:36:45.124 --> 02:36:46.245]  You want him killed?
[02:36:46.245 --> 02:36:48.668]  How many people you want killed that you don't agree with?
[02:36:48.908 --> 02:36:50.428]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[02:36:50.428 --> 02:36:51.429]  She's saying, kill me, kill me.
[02:36:51.429 --> 02:36:52.949]  Of course you're supposed to get mad.
[02:36:52.949 --> 02:36:54.049]  And you can hear the audio.
[02:36:54.049 --> 02:37:00.030]  Her husband gets in his face, bumps him with his chest, and then as soon as our guest does not back down, he backs off.
[02:37:00.030 --> 02:37:09.012]  But it's like, dude, imagine the years that Michael DeBerry's been out there, and now with a Trump sign, M4 sign, playing my show.
[02:37:09.012 --> 02:37:11.533]  It's not blaring, but you know, you walk by, you can hear it, free speech.
[02:37:12.554 --> 02:37:14.315]  He doesn't break the noise ordinance.
[02:37:14.315 --> 02:37:20.598]  He was just going through, and we gotta let him go, and we'll get him back up in the near future, maybe get him a little bit better Skype connection, mic-wise.
[02:37:20.598 --> 02:37:23.039]  But you can find his stuff on HD on his website.
[02:37:23.039 --> 02:37:25.421]  The Price of Freedom is Eternal Vigilance.
[02:37:25.421 --> 02:37:30.183]  He's got GoFundMe.com forward slash Infowagon, so you can continue doing this.
[02:37:30.183 --> 02:37:33.525]  It's really amazing what he does.
[02:37:33.525 --> 02:37:37.327]  And this really triggers these anti-free speech folks.
[02:37:38.067 --> 02:37:43.252]  So, he wants to get a motorcycle now, I guess, with the GoFundMe, to even do it better than a bicycle, so he can do even more.
[02:37:43.252 --> 02:37:47.675]  But he's been doing this for a long time, and all over the newspaper, it's affecting a lot of people.
[02:37:47.675 --> 02:37:51.519]  So, again, Michael, we're going to do a story on this, too, and link to your GoFundMe.
[02:37:51.519 --> 02:37:56.243]  I know the listeners have supported you before, and you've really gotten the word out, but just finishing up what you've gone through.
[02:37:56.243 --> 02:37:59.325]  And, again, I'm not even conservative.
[02:37:59.325 --> 02:38:01.447]  I'm a libertarian patriot, just like you are.
[02:38:01.447 --> 02:38:02.528]  You used to be a mainline liberal.
[02:38:02.528 --> 02:38:03.309]  I mean, I get that.
[02:38:04.298 --> 02:38:09.380]  But is it mainly liberals now that are being triggered on you or is it a mix of people?
[02:38:09.380 --> 02:38:19.485]  Oh, well, the liberals, I mean, it's so fascinating just to sit and watch the people that come by and look at my artwork will see the cutouts.
[02:38:19.485 --> 02:38:22.766]  You can pretty much tell by the expression on their face where they're coming from.
[02:38:22.766 --> 02:38:22.826]  And
[02:38:26.833 --> 02:38:28.834]  I give the liberals 10 to 1 nods.
[02:38:28.834 --> 02:38:37.861]  I tell them, look, if we want to have a conversation on camera, I'll put up $10 to year one, and if I say anything you think that is off-base, we'll look it up and I'll take your money.
[02:38:37.861 --> 02:38:39.062]  But they don't take the bet.
[02:38:39.062 --> 02:38:40.483]  99 out of 100 of them don't.
[02:38:40.483 --> 02:38:43.825]  They won't even put up a dollar for the conditions.
[02:38:43.825 --> 02:38:45.566]  And I've offered $10.
[02:38:45.566 --> 02:38:50.250]  I'll say, look, I'll give you $10 just so I can prove you wrong on camera.
[02:38:51.420 --> 02:38:55.483]  I offered a woman $100 the other week, and I went, oh gee, did I go too far?
[02:38:55.483 --> 02:38:58.665]  She didn't take it!
[02:38:58.665 --> 02:39:04.148]  But that lady, at the end of the day, she tried to steal one of my cameras.
[02:39:04.148 --> 02:39:05.969]  That's why I'm taking her court.
[02:39:05.969 --> 02:39:13.254]  So I called up the cops, and she was dumb enough to stick around and wait for the cops to show up.
[02:39:13.254 --> 02:39:14.255]  Because I didn't know her name.
[02:39:14.255 --> 02:39:14.795]  She could have left.
[02:39:14.795 --> 02:39:16.296]  They weren't going to do a dragnet for her.
[02:39:17.177 --> 02:39:24.142]  And then she told the cop, tried to justify trying to steal my camera because of what I was displaying.
[02:39:24.142 --> 02:39:26.824]  I mean, and the cop was just going, what are you, crazy?
[02:39:26.824 --> 02:39:30.186]  I mean, she says, I gave her, so he gave her a citation for tampering.
[02:39:30.186 --> 02:39:31.687]  That's what I'm going to court for.
[02:39:31.687 --> 02:39:33.669]  But you brought up Gruber too.
[02:39:33.669 --> 02:39:34.609]  It's funny.
[02:39:34.609 --> 02:39:38.732]  When you talk about the people that come by, I talked to Gruber's sister for a half hour.
[02:39:38.732 --> 02:39:45.437]  Her and her husband came by not long after when he first did that, you know, Americans are stupid.
[02:39:46.560 --> 02:39:52.624]  Maybe we should just hire you as a reporter and have you pop in during the live shows and play clips of what happens.
[02:39:52.624 --> 02:39:53.664]  Maybe we should do that.
[02:39:53.664 --> 02:39:55.105]  How many years have you been listening?
[02:39:55.105 --> 02:39:58.327]  How many years have you had the info wagon out there?
[02:40:15.303 --> 02:40:23.570]  If you go to my website now, I was perusing some of my old work, and I did a cartoon strip on you nine years ago, eight years ago.
[02:40:23.570 --> 02:40:23.870]  Wow.
[02:40:23.870 --> 02:40:33.398]  Yeah, it's first page when you go to my website, and it's an AJ comic strip, and so at least that one, but longer actually.
[02:40:33.398 --> 02:40:39.183]  I mean, I got things from you when you actually used to personally sign them.
[02:40:39.998 --> 02:40:42.220]  I got a couple of your details.
[02:40:55.353 --> 02:40:55.913]  God bless you.
[02:40:55.913 --> 02:40:56.733]  Thank you very much, son.
[02:40:56.733 --> 02:40:57.293]  I bless you.
[02:40:57.293 --> 02:40:58.514]  I just wish we had more time today.
[02:40:58.514 --> 02:40:59.314]  There's so much to get to.
[02:40:59.314 --> 02:41:10.097]  We've got breaking news with Dr. Jerome Corsi, and I promise I'm going to go to Mike, and I promise I'm going to go to Zachary, and I'm going to go to Jason, and Joel, and Matt before I end this broadcast today.
[02:41:10.097 --> 02:41:14.018]  And then we've got coming up Anthony Cumia in the fourth hour.
[02:41:14.018 --> 02:41:18.399]  But before I go to Dr. Jerome Corsi with the huge breaking news, and it is huge,
[02:41:19.298 --> 02:41:20.999]  This could bring down Obama, all of them.
[02:41:20.999 --> 02:41:24.662]  I want to talk about the authoritarianism we're facing.
[02:41:24.662 --> 02:41:30.806]  You just saw that fellow who's been on the show for like 10 years, who's had been in the newspaper countless times.
[02:41:30.806 --> 02:41:34.669]  Now he's getting assaulted by Democrats and he used to be a liberal.
[02:41:34.669 --> 02:41:38.091]  They're trying to drive cars into him, they're hitting him, they're stealing his cameras.
[02:41:38.091 --> 02:41:39.652]  It's been in the newspaper.
[02:41:39.652 --> 02:41:42.434]  The police have cited people, you just heard it.
[02:41:42.434 --> 02:41:47.018]  And it's this aggression, where I have them on the street come up to me,
[02:41:49.062 --> 02:41:52.605]  And actually show me their gun and say, you and Trump better watch it.
[02:41:52.605 --> 02:41:55.128]  And I'm just like, man, what is your problem?
[02:41:55.128 --> 02:41:58.871]  We're just trying to cut taxes and turn the economy back on.
[02:41:58.871 --> 02:42:02.955]  Ron Paul has said Trump's doing a great job of the economy, but he may not succeed.
[02:42:02.955 --> 02:42:05.597]  I mean, we're going off the edge of a cliff right now.
[02:42:05.597 --> 02:42:08.520]  You better be rooting for Trump.
[02:42:08.520 --> 02:42:11.102]  We expect him to defeat the Globals and not meet with Kissinger?
[02:42:11.102 --> 02:42:12.764]  Or meet with Kim Jong-un or any of these people?
[02:42:12.764 --> 02:42:14.265]  I mean, this is what's going on.
[02:42:15.267 --> 02:42:24.330]  But you look at somebody, I've always, I don't like much TV, but I always liked the different shows that Tim Allen had, and they're wholesome, they're funny, he's a good guy.
[02:42:24.330 --> 02:42:37.014]  And I can't let my kids watch TV without me being there, because it's all just brainwashing messages and anti-father messages and just weirdness.
[02:42:37.014 --> 02:42:41.376]  And I learned how powerful TV can be once when my daughters were younger, and I let them watch Huey, Louie, and Dewey, the bad
[02:42:42.262 --> 02:42:50.327]  Nephews of Donald Trump, and they were doing all this bad stuff, and my girls started actually acting like Huey, Louie, and Dewey for about a couple days, so I had to explain to them, you know, you can't just act like that.
[02:42:50.327 --> 02:43:05.836]  So, it's good to have good role models, and Tim Allen has just come out very mildly and said, there's a lot of brainwashing, there's a lot of demonization, a lot of threats, you know, if you just tacitly support Trump, or if you don't want a gay parade with naked people with your kids.
[02:43:05.836 --> 02:43:09.919]  I'm not against gay people, he said, but a lot of heterosexuals are out there running around swinging their goods.
[02:43:12.256 --> 02:43:19.818]  So there's this in-our-face kind of conquering going on by the left as they persecute anybody that's conservative in Hollywood as they do all this.
[02:43:19.818 --> 02:43:30.460]  So I thought, since he's been fired, ABC has killed, midway through the season, even though it's a hit show, a hit show, they've killed his show.
[02:43:30.460 --> 02:43:32.360]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:43:32.360 --> 02:43:37.061]  ABC cancelled Tim Allen's highly rated TV show two months after he called out hysterical anti-Trump left.
[02:43:38.194 --> 02:43:42.215]  ABC has cancelled Last Man Standing sitcom despite good ratings.
[02:43:42.215 --> 02:43:46.556]  There may be some to wonder whether the show was canned because of Alan's conservative politics.
[02:43:46.556 --> 02:43:48.677]  I'm not kidding, you gotta be real careful out here.
[02:43:48.677 --> 02:43:52.277]  You get beat up if you don't believe what everybody else believes, said Alan.
[02:43:52.277 --> 02:43:53.698]  It's like 1930s Germany.
[02:43:53.698 --> 02:44:02.800]  Let's go ahead and play that clip, and then I'm gonna go to Dr. Corsi so you understand the stories Corsi's been breaking haven't gone viral with the public.
[02:44:02.800 --> 02:44:05.581]  It's only 300 million stolen by Obama illegally.
[02:44:05.581 --> 02:44:06.281]  Could bring them all down.
[02:44:08.612 --> 02:44:13.975]  But it has gone viral in government, in the FBI, in Congress, and of course he's getting this from congressional and White House sources.
[02:44:13.975 --> 02:44:23.321]  So it's great to have some of his stories go viral, but Paul's all go viral because they're kind of, you know, meat and potato stuff there by, you know, a black professor telling him to kill all the whites or, you know, a woman saying kill me.
[02:44:23.321 --> 02:44:24.502]  He's just showing how they're out of control.
[02:44:24.502 --> 02:44:26.383]  But this is hardcore documents.
[02:44:26.383 --> 02:44:28.124]  Now, for the first two months, he said it was all fake.
[02:44:29.107 --> 02:44:31.808]  And then now the Treasury Secretary came out last week and said, no, it's all real.
[02:44:31.808 --> 02:44:39.089]  Now Obama is in trouble because Trump wants a bigger investigation, and Trump's killing the program, which will kill Obamacare, because they're looting the money to do it.
[02:44:39.089 --> 02:44:43.830]  As Corsi advised the President and others months ago, kill this, you'll kill Obamacare.
[02:44:43.830 --> 02:44:46.010]  One way or the other, there's more than one way to skin a cat.
[02:44:46.010 --> 02:44:48.771]  Even if this bill doesn't pass the Senate, it's passed the House.
[02:44:48.771 --> 02:44:52.292]  But if Trump kills it by cutting the money off, that's the smarter way.
[02:44:52.292 --> 02:44:54.032]  Or kills it legislatively, just as good.
[02:44:55.134 --> 02:44:57.040]  But we're going to go to this clip and then go to him.
[02:44:57.040 --> 02:44:59.767]  ABC cancels Tim Allen's highly rated show.
[02:44:59.767 --> 02:45:02.956]  He was threatened, he said this in his tweets, to stop giving these type of speeches.
[02:45:02.956 --> 02:45:03.237]  Here it is.
[02:45:04.292 --> 02:45:06.053]  You went to the Presidential Inauguration, right?
[02:45:06.053 --> 02:45:13.318]  I was invited by, we did a VIP thing for the vets, and went to the Veterans Ball, and so I went to go see the Democrats and Republicans.
[02:45:13.318 --> 02:45:14.499]  Yeah, I went to the Inauguration.
[02:45:14.499 --> 02:45:15.940]  I'm not attacking you!
[02:45:15.940 --> 02:45:18.962]  You get in this town, I'm not kidding.
[02:45:18.962 --> 02:45:21.623]  You gotta be real careful around here, you know, you get beat up.
[02:45:21.623 --> 02:45:25.606]  If you don't believe what everybody believes, this is like 30s Germany.
[02:45:25.606 --> 02:45:27.787]  I don't know what happened.
[02:45:27.787 --> 02:45:31.490]  If you're not part of the group, you know what we believe is right.
[02:45:31.490 --> 02:45:33.051]  They go, well, I might have a problem.
[02:45:34.331 --> 02:45:35.072]  I'm a comedian.
[02:45:35.072 --> 02:45:38.194]  I like going on buzz nights.
[02:45:38.194 --> 02:45:40.556]  This government does stuff big.
[02:45:40.556 --> 02:45:41.997]  I've never been to anything like that.
[02:45:41.997 --> 02:45:42.778]  Was it a big deal?
[02:45:42.778 --> 02:45:44.059]  I mean, just so many people.
[02:45:44.059 --> 02:45:50.083]  And when they show up, you know, the ex-president gets in a helicopter and there's jets and Marines taking him this way and the other.
[02:45:50.083 --> 02:45:51.024]  And there's parades.
[02:45:51.024 --> 02:45:52.545]  But it looks like a Cadillac parade.
[02:45:52.545 --> 02:45:55.027]  Everything was just rows of Cadillacs.
[02:45:55.027 --> 02:45:57.089]  My kids were going, is this the parade?
[02:45:57.089 --> 02:45:59.851]  It's like black Cadillac after black Cadillac and then a tractor.
[02:45:59.851 --> 02:46:00.552]  I don't know what was it.
[02:46:01.352 --> 02:46:02.933]  There's no, like, marching bands.
[02:46:02.933 --> 02:46:04.134]  There's nothing.
[02:46:04.134 --> 02:46:04.835]  I like parades.
[02:46:04.835 --> 02:46:06.897]  I used to like parades, which is a funny off story.
[02:46:06.897 --> 02:46:08.938]  I took my little ones.
[02:46:08.938 --> 02:46:11.160]  I'm not ignorant, but sometimes I play it.
[02:46:11.160 --> 02:46:15.363]  We went to see the Santa Monica parade down in, um, on Santa Monica Boulevard.
[02:46:15.363 --> 02:46:15.604]  Okay.
[02:46:15.604 --> 02:46:16.424]  The gay parade.
[02:46:16.424 --> 02:46:16.845]  Oh, okay.
[02:46:16.845 --> 02:46:20.548]  I thought it would, when it, when it's a gay, I thought, wouldn't there be floats and stuff?
[02:46:20.548 --> 02:46:22.589]  You don't want to take a five-year-old to that parade.
[02:46:22.589 --> 02:46:23.110]  You don't want to...
[02:46:24.205 --> 02:46:31.028]  I'm standing on it, I say, look at the music, look, it's a fire truck with naked men on it.
[02:46:31.028 --> 02:46:34.029]  There's no Bullwinkle.
[02:46:34.029 --> 02:46:41.092]  Gay pride parades have a different tone than Disney on ice parades.
[02:46:41.092 --> 02:46:42.393]  There's no ice for one thing.
[02:46:42.393 --> 02:46:44.834]  There's no ice, it's a lot of nude guys on vehicles.
[02:46:44.834 --> 02:46:45.474]  It's hard to...
[02:46:45.874 --> 02:46:51.356]  So you're talking about, you know, well you do stand-up, you go around, the country is very divided.
[02:46:51.356 --> 02:46:51.936]  Yeah.
[02:46:51.936 --> 02:46:53.597]  Do you, well like, what are you worried about?
[02:46:53.597 --> 02:46:56.417]  I'm worried about, I have buddies that are in the security business.
[02:46:56.417 --> 02:47:03.920]  I'm a tech freak, so I have a guy that's got no, he always has battery, like cell phones that batteries come out, because he tells me this weird story.
[02:47:03.920 --> 02:47:06.281]  He says, you put an iPhone down for a week, you shut it off.
[02:47:06.281 --> 02:47:07.321]  In a week it's dead, right?
[02:47:07.321 --> 02:47:09.782]  And I go, oh god, it's not really ever off.
[02:47:09.782 --> 02:47:10.802]  He goes, no, it's never off.
[02:47:10.882 --> 02:47:13.284]  They always know where you are, and I go, oh God.
[02:47:13.284 --> 02:47:15.765]  I get paranoid just from being around this cat.
[02:47:15.765 --> 02:47:15.945]  Oh.
[02:47:15.945 --> 02:47:23.970]  But one day I was thinking, if a government drove by down the street with like a gray sedan with a camera on it, you'd be rioting going to Washington.
[02:47:23.970 --> 02:47:28.834]  But if it's white with emojis and Google on it, yay, you're waving at it!
[02:47:28.834 --> 02:47:32.836]  They're taking pictures of your house!
[02:47:32.836 --> 02:47:35.318]  All right, let's stop right there.
[02:47:35.658 --> 02:47:38.540]  Guaranteed Tim Allen knows everything I know and more.
[02:47:38.540 --> 02:47:51.048]  Now I was told by engineers under the Telecommunications Act of 96 that they would have smartphones tracking everything we did as little computers and that the TVs were going to send waves out but also light bulbs and control them and track everything you do.
[02:47:51.048 --> 02:47:57.432]  So the guys I knew that worked at the NSA and Time Warner in places and AT&T they would put them in little lead lined sacks.
[02:47:58.072 --> 02:47:59.233]  That actually spies were given.
[02:47:59.233 --> 02:48:04.496]  Now everybody knows about blocket pockets and all those systems because you gotta put it in that.
[02:48:04.496 --> 02:48:07.278]  Or you're being tracked, your location, they're listening to you.
[02:48:07.278 --> 02:48:10.760]  Well you say, well I have nothing to hide.
[02:48:10.760 --> 02:48:13.702]  Thieves use your Facebook to break into your house and steal what you got, folks.
[02:48:13.702 --> 02:48:16.583]  You put locators on the photos and stuff, they know right where you live.
[02:48:16.583 --> 02:48:17.244]  Don't be idiots.
[02:48:17.244 --> 02:48:18.104]  Think about thieves.
[02:48:18.104 --> 02:48:18.865]  What about governments?
[02:48:19.653 --> 02:48:23.334]  We had nothing to hide with Obama, but he was spying on everybody to try to steal the election for Hillary.
[02:48:23.334 --> 02:48:23.974]  Didn't work!
[02:48:23.974 --> 02:48:25.114]  Now they're all pissed!
[02:48:25.114 --> 02:48:27.595]  Saying Trump's a liar, he's crazy, spying's going on.
[02:48:27.595 --> 02:48:41.278]  But Tim Allen went on Kimmel, that's ABC, to promote his show, and I guarantee you, they made the decision because of what he's been doing to shut him up because they want to intimidate everybody and let Hollywood know, we don't care if you got hit shows, you keep your mouth shut so you're off the air.
[02:48:42.358 --> 02:48:49.826]  One of the biggest TV producers in the country, a guy that produces $100 million shows for HBO, you name it, and I've had other big ones on.
[02:48:49.826 --> 02:48:52.770]  But I mean guys that make the biggest shows out there.
[02:48:52.770 --> 02:48:56.574]  You know, guys that have been married to the most beautiful women in Hollywood.
[02:48:56.574 --> 02:48:59.297]  And they say, yeah, we have secret meetings in Hollywood, and I ran another big
[02:48:59.397 --> 02:48:59.777]  I don't think so.
[02:49:19.761 --> 02:49:24.783]  They may be trying to intimidate, and they can fire Tim Allen when he's a hit guy, he'll just go somewhere else.
[02:49:24.783 --> 02:49:31.945]  But we need not even conservative networks, we need libertarian networks, where it's real family until 10 o'clock, and then a little bit more racy after that, whatever.
[02:49:31.945 --> 02:49:33.946]  The point is just that it's free.
[02:49:33.946 --> 02:49:46.110]  Maybe there's a liberal show, then a conservative show, a libertarian show, but just whatever's exciting, whatever's popular in its time slot, just have freedom to build what you want, do what you want,
[02:49:47.344 --> 02:49:48.845]  And don't try to intimidate everybody.
[02:49:48.845 --> 02:49:50.447]  And that's what the whole theme of this is.
[02:49:50.447 --> 02:49:58.754]  Like the last guy, with him trying to beat him up and saying I should be killed for just having a sandwich board and a TV out there playing my show in New Orleans.
[02:49:58.754 --> 02:50:00.315]  So, let's talk about the censorship.
[02:50:00.315 --> 02:50:01.316]  Let's talk about the threats because
[02:50:04.252 --> 02:50:09.235]  I can't get into a lot of this stuff right now because it's about to all, obviously, be phased out in the current stuff that's going on.
[02:50:09.235 --> 02:50:12.077]  But some good things are happening, but I just have to leave it at that.
[02:50:12.077 --> 02:50:12.917]  Let's just say this, though.
[02:50:12.917 --> 02:50:15.359]  All hell's been breaking loose around here because they're really pissed.
[02:50:15.359 --> 02:50:20.302]  And some of the things I've been told by sources are, you need to basically stop having sources in the White House.
[02:50:20.302 --> 02:50:21.823]  The system doesn't like it.
[02:50:21.823 --> 02:50:24.524]  And you need to stop going after the Federal Reserve.
[02:50:24.524 --> 02:50:27.867]  You need to stop going after Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
[02:50:27.867 --> 02:50:29.528]  This really has people upset.
[02:50:29.528 --> 02:50:31.229]  And I'm like, yeah, well, the stories aren't going viral.
[02:50:31.229 --> 02:50:32.870]  They're like, yeah, well, they're going viral in the government.
[02:50:33.610 --> 02:50:37.111]  So see, there's kind of multiple things InfoWars does.
[02:50:37.111 --> 02:50:39.692]  So, I'm not running down Corsi.
[02:50:39.692 --> 02:50:41.412]  He has a lot of articles that do go viral.
[02:50:41.412 --> 02:50:46.454]  But a lot of these more technical ones, when he has a degree in, you know, banking and finance from Harvard, he's respected in D.C.
[02:50:46.454 --> 02:50:47.714]  That's his main job.
[02:50:47.714 --> 02:50:49.595]  People are really listening to him.
[02:50:49.595 --> 02:50:53.476]  So, that's why they had some of the conservative media demonize him last week, or two weeks ago, and say it was fake.
[02:50:54.016 --> 02:50:57.180]  They got egg on their face now that the Treasury Secretary says, no, it's real.
[02:50:57.180 --> 02:51:01.245]  Now Trump's coming out and he is trying to kill the Obama program of looting it.
[02:51:01.245 --> 02:51:02.806]  So he's here with big developments.
[02:51:02.806 --> 02:51:06.931]  But first off, what do you make of the attempts, Dr. Corsi of Infowars.com, our D.C.
[02:51:06.931 --> 02:51:14.160]  Bureau head, what do you make of them openly, nakedly trying to threaten us to shut down your stories?
[02:51:16.232 --> 02:51:19.914]  I think it's to be expected, because we're having such an impact.
[02:51:19.914 --> 02:51:35.064]  I mean, today, I monitored the hearing of the Senate Banking Committee, and Mel Watt, who is the regulator of Fannie and Freddie, he heads the Federal Housing Finance Agency, just said it's in his authority to end
[02:51:36.131 --> 02:51:39.752]  The Treasury's sweeping all the profits out of Fannie and Freddie.
[02:51:39.752 --> 02:51:47.734]  He's going to make sure that the two government-sponsored enterprises have enough capital to keep running, and it's his decision.
[02:51:47.734 --> 02:51:53.895]  And so he said, as of now, he doesn't intend to give any more money to the Treasury Department.
[02:51:53.895 --> 02:51:55.215]  He's going to make his own decision.
[02:51:55.215 --> 02:51:58.156]  He'd be happy to talk to Treasury about it.
[02:51:58.877 --> 02:52:06.547]  But the law that created his agency gives him the authority to make sure that Fannie and Freddie are well capitalized.
[02:52:06.547 --> 02:52:10.491]  So the good news is Trump is killing the looting of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?
[02:52:10.491 --> 02:52:11.172]  Precisely.
[02:52:11.172 --> 02:52:17.360]  Senator Corker was at the hearing and he was the one I constantly
[02:52:17.990 --> 02:52:22.533]  Targeted is wanting to give the mortgage market over to the banks.
[02:52:22.533 --> 02:52:27.837]  Banks that he's made millions of dollars in loans with, Bank of America, Wells Fargo.
[02:52:27.837 --> 02:52:29.758]  Corker was about to be tied.
[02:52:29.758 --> 02:52:35.602]  He offered, he said, we'll give you $10 billion more capital to keep running Fannie and Freddie.
[02:52:35.602 --> 02:52:36.623]  And Mel Watts
[02:52:37.521 --> 02:52:39.043]  ...said, no, we don't need it.
[02:52:39.043 --> 02:52:46.791]  And Belmont knew that as long as they were taking federal money, they couldn't recapitalize Fannie and Freddie for the shareholders.
[02:52:46.791 --> 02:52:48.552]  Let me ask you this, because they're clearly not just looting it.
[02:52:48.552 --> 02:52:50.214]  Why do the Democrats want to bankrupt it?
[02:52:50.214 --> 02:52:51.996]  I mean, Obama made no secret of that.
[02:52:53.120 --> 02:52:55.902]  Well, because it was free cash.
[02:52:55.902 --> 02:52:58.765]  They had over $266 billion.
[02:52:58.765 --> 02:53:00.186]  They were up against the wall.
[02:53:00.186 --> 02:53:08.953]  The House of Representatives had refused to fund the insurance subsidies under Obamacare.
[02:53:08.953 --> 02:53:11.756]  Obamacare was going to crash in the first year.
[02:53:12.236 --> 02:53:20.888]  That's right, so it's multi-faceted, propped up Obamacare with it, but also just like the Federal Reserve under Obama, doesn't want cheap loans to the public, only cheap loans to big banks.
[02:53:20.888 --> 02:53:23.472]  So this is all part of making people poor, picking winners and losers.
[02:53:24.315 --> 02:53:29.861]  Yes, and it's also part of the scheme that the Obama administration had, that they were going to let Fannie and Freddie fail.
[02:53:29.861 --> 02:53:32.444]  They were going to take all the capital out of them.
[02:53:32.444 --> 02:53:36.869]  So by the end of this year, they would have zero capital in Fannie and Freddie.
[02:53:36.869 --> 02:53:43.076]  And then they were going to give the mortgage market over to the big banks and the hedge funds and Wall Street.
[02:53:43.576 --> 02:53:46.657]  Which would mean that we would become a nation of renters.
[02:53:46.657 --> 02:53:50.758]  The Treasury Department, I revealed the documents, we published them.
[02:53:50.758 --> 02:53:53.458]  It shook the very base of Washington.
[02:53:53.458 --> 02:54:02.440]  When these documents were published, the Treasury, under Geithner and under the Obama administration, wanted to end the American dream of us being homeowners.
[02:54:02.440 --> 02:54:03.700]  We're all going to become renters.
[02:54:03.700 --> 02:54:05.601]  We're going to become a nation of renters.
[02:54:06.289 --> 02:54:16.073]  And then when Corker today asked that question, and Mel Watt quietly sat there and corrected him and said, we're not taking $10 billion, we don't need it.
[02:54:16.073 --> 02:54:21.235]  We can very well capitalize ourselves by just keeping our earnings, and that's what we're going to do.
[02:54:21.235 --> 02:54:22.455]  And we're going to recapitalize.
[02:54:22.455 --> 02:54:29.338]  Wow, a federal agency helping people get low-interest loans, actually working, being solvent, and helping the country.
[02:54:29.338 --> 02:54:30.778]  But the megabanks don't want that.
[02:54:30.778 --> 02:54:31.959]  They want a bunch of poor people.
[02:54:33.498 --> 02:54:39.480]  Renting from, you know, the major builders that are building in conjunction, like Corker.
[02:54:39.480 --> 02:54:42.721]  250 square foot coffin apartments.
[02:54:42.721 --> 02:54:43.341]  Precisely.
[02:54:43.341 --> 02:54:47.423]  And put everybody in, you know, 800 square feet.
[02:54:47.423 --> 02:54:49.203]  That's their idea of the American Dream.
[02:54:49.203 --> 02:54:50.124]  The new one's 250.
[02:54:50.124 --> 02:54:51.964]  Well, right.
[02:54:51.964 --> 02:54:54.105]  I mean, give you a little cubicle.
[02:54:54.105 --> 02:54:55.686]  That's what they're aiming for.
[02:54:55.686 --> 02:54:59.527]  And when we exposed this and made it clear, even at the hearing today,
[02:55:00.441 --> 02:55:08.366]  Mel Walt was asked whether a 30 year fixed rate mortgage would survive without Fannie and Freddie, without a government guarantee.
[02:55:08.366 --> 02:55:10.408]  And he said no, it wouldn't survive.
[02:55:10.408 --> 02:55:16.032]  Now that's the bedrock of people getting first time home loans.
[02:55:16.032 --> 02:55:17.973]  The ability to get a 30 year fixed rate mortgage.
[02:55:17.973 --> 02:55:22.016]  So they're trying to blow up the stairway into middle class and then into wealth.
[02:55:22.016 --> 02:55:25.138]  This is so dastardly, so dirty, and Trump's trying to save it.
[02:55:26.317 --> 02:55:33.403]  And finally, Trump, you know, we wrote a series of articles and we said that all Trump had to do was to
[02:55:34.193 --> 02:55:37.034]  Not fund the insurance subsidies.
[02:55:37.034 --> 02:55:43.836]  The White House started saying to the Democrats, we can end Obamacare tomorrow by just not paying the insurance subsidies.
[02:55:43.836 --> 02:55:53.278]  And now, we pointed out again that Mel Watt and the Federal Home Financing Agency has the authority on his own.
[02:55:53.278 --> 02:55:56.219]  He doesn't have to ask the Department of Treasury.
[02:55:56.832 --> 02:55:58.433]  He can make the decision himself.
[02:55:58.433 --> 02:55:58.853]  Sure.
[02:55:58.853 --> 02:56:11.061]  Shouldn't the Republicans start hearings and get on the offense that Obama looted $300 billion at least, that all these lawsuits came out and got covered up, that they're still wanting to loot it, and that they want to destroy small homeowners?
[02:56:11.061 --> 02:56:14.002]  I mean, literally, I mean, they even did the loans that were fraudulent.
[02:56:14.002 --> 02:56:15.944]  They now admit to bankrupt the whole system.
[02:56:15.944 --> 02:56:19.926]  I mean, these are monsters, just like George Soros wants to bankrupt the dollar.
[02:56:19.926 --> 02:56:21.027]  I mean, these are just criminals.
[02:56:22.027 --> 02:56:24.328]  And not pay the stockholders.
[02:56:24.328 --> 02:56:31.709]  The stockholders, and there's lots of, you know, they're not paying out all kinds of benefits to the former employees of Fannie and Freddie.
[02:56:31.709 --> 02:56:32.610]  This is a crime.
[02:56:32.610 --> 02:56:36.791]  That's right, they're looting the federal pensions, they're not paying out the dividends.
[02:56:36.791 --> 02:56:41.992]  I mean, they're just literally destroying any independent wealth that isn't owned by the Federal Reserve Group of Banks.
[02:56:41.992 --> 02:56:42.592]  It's unbelievable.
[02:56:43.500 --> 02:56:47.465]  And this is another thing tying back to firing Comey.
[02:56:47.465 --> 02:56:54.273]  If we had an FBI that wasn't protecting the socialist left, and Comey was a fixer.
[02:56:54.273 --> 02:56:56.355]  I've written articles... Well look at all his deputies!
[02:56:56.355 --> 02:56:58.157]  They're a bunch of Democrats that give to Hillary!
[02:56:58.157 --> 02:57:03.964]  I mean, Trump got rid of him because he literally said Trump was crazy and a liar about wiretapping that was admitted!
[02:57:05.827 --> 02:57:10.089]  And the FBI is not investigating the theft of Fannie and Freddie.
[02:57:10.089 --> 02:57:11.790]  I know you have a lot of FBI contacts.
[02:57:11.790 --> 02:57:14.191]  Mine all hated Comey.
[02:57:14.191 --> 02:57:15.492]  Stone says all his hate Comey.
[02:57:15.492 --> 02:57:17.613]  What are your FBI sources saying?
[02:57:17.613 --> 02:57:19.554]  I know FBI agents in Austin that love you.
[02:57:19.554 --> 02:57:21.375]  I know senior retired ones that love you.
[02:57:21.375 --> 02:57:22.636]  The FBI really respects you.
[02:57:22.636 --> 02:57:23.896]  So what are they telling you?
[02:57:25.455 --> 02:57:33.361]  Well, the senior ones that I know that, you know, are reliable just hate Comey because he politicized the FBI.
[02:57:33.361 --> 02:57:37.284]  I mean, when he came out, it was completely unconscionable.
[02:57:37.284 --> 02:57:38.145]  He gave this litany.
[02:57:39.921 --> 02:57:46.044]  All the things that Hillary had done wrong with her server and then said he wasn't going to prosecute her.
[02:57:46.044 --> 02:57:50.667]  Well, first of all, it wasn't his decision to make to prosecute her or not.
[02:57:50.667 --> 02:57:57.590]  He should have had a grand jury in there taking testimony, and he left Hillary off the hook.
[02:57:57.590 --> 02:57:59.171]  Ask Roger Stone.
[02:57:59.171 --> 02:58:00.372]  We were the ones who forced
[02:58:01.658 --> 02:58:04.839]  Call me to re-open the Weiner investigation.
[02:58:04.839 --> 02:58:05.560]  Sure.
[02:58:05.560 --> 02:58:10.101]  I knew that Huma Ahmadine was sending her emails to Yahoo.com.
[02:58:10.101 --> 02:58:14.123]  I wrote about that, documented it, and they had to end up in Weiner's email.
[02:58:14.907 --> 02:58:19.611]  The New York Police Department had that laptop, so the FBI had to investigate.
[02:58:19.611 --> 02:58:20.051]  That's right.
[02:58:20.051 --> 02:58:20.431]  Amazing.
[02:58:20.431 --> 02:58:25.175]  We'll come back in the next few days and let's watch where this is going, but they're really trying to get Trump.
[02:58:25.175 --> 02:58:28.437]  I don't see that successfully happening unless we don't back Trump.
[02:58:28.437 --> 02:58:30.619]  Dr. Corsi for InfoWars.com.
[02:58:30.619 --> 02:58:32.580]  People can also email you there on your email.
[02:58:32.580 --> 02:58:34.462]  They want to give you any tips.
[02:58:34.462 --> 02:58:36.864]  In fact, I forget, what is your email on InfoWars, Dr. Corsi?
[02:58:36.864 --> 02:58:37.504]  It's doc.
[02:58:41.447 --> 02:58:44.108]  It's Doc, D-R at Infowars.com.
[02:58:44.108 --> 02:58:47.890]  Doc, D-O-C, Doc C, Doc C at Infowars.com.
[02:58:47.890 --> 02:58:48.890]  Alright, thank you so much.
[02:58:48.890 --> 02:58:49.671]  Fourth Hour coming up.
[02:58:50.848 --> 02:58:58.831]  InfoWars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:58:58.831 --> 02:59:05.474]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[02:59:05.474 --> 02:59:13.737]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[02:59:14.037 --> 02:59:19.903]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene.
[02:59:19.903 --> 02:59:23.046]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[02:59:23.046 --> 02:59:28.811]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[02:59:29.131 --> 02:59:29.891]  It works!
[02:59:29.891 --> 02:59:38.216]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[02:59:38.216 --> 02:59:48.101]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfowarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Infowar against the Globalists all at the same time!
[02:59:48.101 --> 02:59:52.783]  A total 360 win!
[02:59:52.783 --> 02:59:55.425]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:11.770 --> 03:00:28.835]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:28.835 --> 03:00:29.915]  Anthony Kirme is coming up.
[03:00:29.915 --> 03:00:33.796]  Don't want to stay with us for that.
[03:00:33.796 --> 03:00:35.857]  Right now, let's go to the callers.
[03:00:35.857 --> 03:00:37.177]  I'm sorry I've been holding so long, Mike.
[03:00:37.177 --> 03:00:38.838]  Mike in Iowa, go ahead.
[03:00:40.700 --> 03:00:41.802]  Hey Alex, how you doing today?
[03:00:41.802 --> 03:00:42.322]  Good, brother.
[03:00:42.322 --> 03:00:46.187]  Well, I mean, Trump's about to kill the eluding of Fannie and Freddie Mac.
[03:00:46.187 --> 03:00:46.868]  That's totally illegal.
[03:00:46.868 --> 03:00:47.389]  That's beautiful.
[03:00:47.389 --> 03:00:49.792]  He fired that turd, Comey.
[03:00:49.792 --> 03:00:50.153]  I love it.
[03:00:50.153 --> 03:00:52.596]  In fact, the word is Trump is taking the gloves off as one of the offense.
[03:00:52.596 --> 03:00:56.581]  That comes directly from, let's just say very close to the president.
[03:00:56.581 --> 03:00:56.842]  Go ahead.
[03:00:57.574 --> 03:01:01.337]  Well, I first want to say I'm very glad to talk to you.
[03:01:01.337 --> 03:01:04.180]  I listened to your 30-hour broadcast.
[03:01:04.180 --> 03:01:05.160]  It was amazing.
[03:01:05.160 --> 03:01:06.802]  A lot of great people on there.
[03:01:06.802 --> 03:01:08.763]  A lot of information to get out to everybody.
[03:01:08.763 --> 03:01:11.666]  I just want to shout out to my daughter.
[03:01:11.666 --> 03:01:13.167]  Today is her fifth birthday.
[03:01:13.167 --> 03:01:14.949]  Happy birthday!
[03:01:14.949 --> 03:01:17.010]  Yep, thank you.
[03:01:17.010 --> 03:01:19.612]  Well, my question is that through
[03:01:20.922 --> 03:01:30.429]  Me watching your show and through me following into politics, started watching your show in about 2004-2005, around that period.
[03:01:30.429 --> 03:01:37.553]  I have started to notice the trend in the disalignment of the two-party system into what now I've seen.
[03:01:37.553 --> 03:01:42.897]  Some say there's a seven-party system, there's even more minority parties into that.
[03:01:42.897 --> 03:01:50.102]  The lack of unification within these parties is very detrimental to the United States in itself.
[03:01:51.103 --> 03:02:01.189]  Especially considering that the parties have so much in common, you know, between the Green Party, the Libertarian Party, Republican Party, etc.
[03:02:01.189 --> 03:02:06.712]  So my question is, what do you think is going to happen going down the road here?
[03:02:06.712 --> 03:02:09.153]  Trump obviously pulled out a win.
[03:02:09.153 --> 03:02:10.294]  I voted for Trump.
[03:02:10.294 --> 03:02:14.176]  I'm supporting him now, even though, you know, some stuff is going on.
[03:02:15.196 --> 03:02:25.441]  So, going down the road, is there going to be a realignment of the parties into a unified two-party system again, or what else is going to happen?
[03:02:25.441 --> 03:02:27.002]  Well, that's a sophisticated question.
[03:02:27.002 --> 03:02:28.603]  I appreciate your call.
[03:02:28.603 --> 03:02:32.805]  You have whole college dissertations on a subject like this debated all day.
[03:02:32.805 --> 03:02:36.767]  I kind of see it as a good thing that the parties are getting more fractured.
[03:02:36.767 --> 03:02:37.848]  That makes them more different.
[03:02:37.848 --> 03:02:43.771]  And then we have the Freedom Caucus and the Libertarians taking over the Republican Party, and Trump is ignoring the establishment.
[03:02:44.735 --> 03:02:44.875]  I think?
[03:03:02.594 --> 03:03:03.355]  It's up to us.
[03:03:03.355 --> 03:03:10.861]  If we run as libertarians, as patriots, if Democrats run as people that are more, you know, reformist and want free market, then we can reform the Democratic Party too.
[03:03:10.861 --> 03:03:13.463]  I think more parties is good.
[03:03:13.463 --> 03:03:19.849]  So if we have broken up groups inside the two parties, that's kind of a natural progression that factions are going to form.
[03:03:19.849 --> 03:03:21.450]  So I don't even see what you're seeing.
[03:03:21.450 --> 03:03:22.431]  You're seeing it as bad.
[03:03:22.431 --> 03:03:24.192]  I'm seeing it as good.
[03:03:24.192 --> 03:03:27.015]  And so the Freedom Caucus scuttled that bad health bill.
[03:03:28.240 --> 03:03:29.461]  Now he's got a lot better one.
[03:03:29.461 --> 03:03:30.582]  Rand Paul's saying it's a lot better.
[03:03:30.582 --> 03:03:31.843]  I've looked at it, it's a lot better.
[03:03:31.843 --> 03:03:33.464]  Now the Senate's going to try to screw it over.
[03:03:33.464 --> 03:03:38.088]  Well, Trump's just going to kill the funding, not letting him loot Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
[03:03:38.088 --> 03:03:39.249]  There's more than one way to scare a cat out of you.
[03:03:39.249 --> 03:03:43.853]  If you really look at what Trump's doing, forget some of his rhetoric, Pat and Henry Kissinger on the head and all that.
[03:03:45.583 --> 03:03:47.885]  He's actually trying to get business deals done for us.
[03:03:47.885 --> 03:03:49.486]  He's bringing in jobs.
[03:03:49.486 --> 03:03:51.427]  He's killing TPP.
[03:03:51.427 --> 03:03:52.708]  He's cutting the U.N.
[03:03:52.708 --> 03:03:54.269]  funding by 50%.
[03:03:54.269 --> 03:03:55.950]  He's gutting them, man.
[03:03:55.950 --> 03:03:58.251]  And he is flooding jobs into the United States.
[03:03:58.251 --> 03:03:59.752]  I hate to be such a cheerleader.
[03:03:59.752 --> 03:04:02.274]  It's just I'm sitting here every day looking at what's really going on.
[03:04:02.274 --> 03:04:07.137]  And then you got the Democrats sold out to foreign multinationals saying we're Russian agents.
[03:04:09.861 --> 03:04:11.242]  Trump just turned all the coal on.
[03:04:11.242 --> 03:04:14.243]  That just cut Russian gas and coal prices by half.
[03:04:14.243 --> 03:04:15.944]  He just devastated Russia.
[03:04:15.944 --> 03:04:17.124]  It wasn't done on purpose.
[03:04:17.124 --> 03:04:19.065]  I mean, it's just, it's our coal.
[03:04:19.065 --> 03:04:20.266]  He's increasing our military.
[03:04:20.266 --> 03:04:20.906]  He's doing all this.
[03:04:20.906 --> 03:04:25.989]  Listen, I'm going to send everybody here that's holding, including Matt, if he's still there, a free t-shirt of your choice.
[03:04:25.989 --> 03:04:28.110]  That's full of bad people that are holding over an hour.
[03:04:28.110 --> 03:04:29.970]  Joel and Jason and Cody and Zachary.
[03:04:29.970 --> 03:04:31.751]  I just want to cut an anti-cumulus time.
[03:04:31.751 --> 03:04:37.054]  Now, that's a lot of work for John Harmon to do, but just get their names, get their numbers, get the t-shirt they want, and I'm going to mail everybody.
[03:04:37.974 --> 03:04:46.122]  A t-shirt of your choice, a Molon Labe, a conservatism is the new counterculture, a Trump-Pence shirt, whatever you want from infowarestore.com.
[03:04:46.122 --> 03:04:48.505]  And for all the listeners out there, please support us.
[03:04:48.505 --> 03:04:53.169]  Please get the nutraceuticals and more because that's how we're funding this operation in the face of all the demonization and more.
[03:04:53.169 --> 03:04:57.193]  Now, Anthony Comey is coming up from compoundmedia.com straight ahead.
[03:04:57.193 --> 03:04:57.814]  So get ready.
[03:05:00.595 --> 03:05:04.218]  Today I want to talk about killing white people in context.
[03:05:04.218 --> 03:05:15.488]  A Texas A&M professor says that some white people may have to die in order to solve racism and bring about true equality.
[03:05:15.488 --> 03:05:17.010]  When we have this conversation about
[03:05:17.330 --> 03:05:17.811]  That was Professor
[03:05:32.227 --> 03:05:32.947]  We're good to go.
[03:06:00.518 --> 03:06:05.984]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:06:05.984 --> 03:06:08.066]  Research across the board is clear.
[03:06:08.066 --> 03:06:13.352]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[03:06:13.352 --> 03:06:17.116]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that
[03:06:17.196 --> 03:06:20.637]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[03:06:20.637 --> 03:06:23.818]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[03:06:23.818 --> 03:06:27.700]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[03:06:27.700 --> 03:06:34.862]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[03:06:34.862 --> 03:06:40.264]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[03:06:40.524 --> 03:06:42.586]  Iodine, nanosilver, and more.
[03:06:42.586 --> 03:06:50.873]  Due to requests from listeners who found that Spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children, we have created the new Bubblegum-flavored Superblue that is Spearmint-free.
[03:06:50.873 --> 03:06:59.180]  Learn more about the new Bubblegum-flavored Superblue toothpaste and more at InfoWarsLife.com and support the InfoWars while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[03:07:01.360 --> 03:07:06.845]  The reason InfoWarsLive has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[03:07:06.845 --> 03:07:07.685]  I take this.
[03:07:07.685 --> 03:07:08.806]  My family takes this.
[03:07:08.806 --> 03:07:13.090]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[03:07:13.090 --> 03:07:17.534]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:07:17.694 --> 03:07:22.335]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[03:07:22.335 --> 03:07:23.455]  I don't feel good.
[03:07:23.455 --> 03:07:27.216]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[03:07:27.216 --> 03:07:29.917]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[03:07:29.917 --> 03:07:35.698]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[03:07:35.698 --> 03:07:38.659]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[03:07:38.659 --> 03:07:42.199]  And I know my hair is a little luxurious once again.
[03:07:42.199 --> 03:07:44.440]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[03:07:44.440 --> 03:07:44.800]  I love it.
[03:07:44.960 --> 03:07:47.763]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[03:07:47.763 --> 03:07:48.764]  Survival Shield X2.
[03:07:48.764 --> 03:07:54.731]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[03:07:54.731 --> 03:07:56.613]  It's got a five-star rating.
[03:07:56.613 --> 03:07:58.816]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[03:08:08.460 --> 03:08:09.522]  News.
[03:08:09.522 --> 03:08:10.864]  Analysis.
[03:08:10.864 --> 03:08:12.306]  Reports.
[03:08:12.306 --> 03:08:15.311]  It's the Alex Jones Show!
[03:08:15.311 --> 03:08:18.916]  And now, your host, Anthony Cumia!
[03:08:23.507 --> 03:08:28.971]  Thank you, thank you Anthony Guglielmo for InfoWars.com.
[03:08:28.971 --> 03:08:30.412]  Very excited.
[03:08:30.412 --> 03:08:35.636]  My God, I love what Donald Trump is doing.
[03:08:35.636 --> 03:08:36.916]  I love this.
[03:08:36.916 --> 03:08:49.745]  Not only has he fired an ineffectual director of the FBI, but he is doing it in such a way that it is driving the left insane.
[03:08:50.706 --> 03:08:58.571]  I can't tell you how fun it is to go on social media and see them losing their minds yet again.
[03:08:58.571 --> 03:09:14.500]  Since he started running for president, when he started getting a lot of traction, we remember the hilarious debates, and we saw the left just melting down during this whole thing, culminating with his victory.
[03:09:15.917 --> 03:09:21.604]  And then after the inauguration, it has been non-stop Trump trolling on the left.
[03:09:21.604 --> 03:09:25.188]  And they are trying to stop him at every turn.
[03:09:25.188 --> 03:09:32.157]  There is nothing he can do that the Liberal Democrats will not throw giant roadblocks in front of.
[03:09:32.997 --> 03:09:39.021]  Uh, and he's gotta, and I think this is one of the real strengths of Donald Trump.
[03:09:39.021 --> 03:09:41.683]  He does have persistence.
[03:09:41.683 --> 03:09:43.884]  This guy will keep going.
[03:09:43.884 --> 03:09:47.226]  I don't think they can get him to, uh,
[03:09:48.567 --> 03:09:50.068]  To back down.
[03:09:50.068 --> 03:09:58.212]  I honestly don't think he feels defeated at any time when these Democrats constantly throw roadblocks.
[03:09:58.212 --> 03:10:00.072]  It doesn't matter what he does.
[03:10:00.072 --> 03:10:05.915]  Everything he does will be looked at as if Hitler did it, of course.
[03:10:05.915 --> 03:10:10.997]  It will be horrible for the American people, horrible for democracy.
[03:10:10.997 --> 03:10:11.758]  That's their
[03:10:12.418 --> 03:10:12.858]  We're good.
[03:10:26.536 --> 03:10:32.637]  And I see what the left is doing and thinking, if you can call it thinking.
[03:10:32.637 --> 03:10:36.418]  It's based 100% on emotion.
[03:10:36.418 --> 03:10:44.459]  I have never seen a group of people so ignorant on a topic, yet so emotional about it.
[03:10:44.459 --> 03:10:47.820]  The facts mean nothing.
[03:10:47.820 --> 03:10:51.621]  I have read things about the impending impeachment.
[03:10:53.518 --> 03:10:55.421]  of Donald Trump for a while now.
[03:10:55.421 --> 03:11:01.409]  And now the new thing is, and this is great, TREASON!
[03:11:01.409 --> 03:11:03.011]  Woah!
[03:11:03.011 --> 03:11:06.997]  Look out, they're gonna get Donald Trump on treason!
[03:11:09.143 --> 03:11:10.144]  Where is this?
[03:11:10.144 --> 03:11:22.693]  Can someone please produce anything that even shows that there is any type of criminal investigation going on against Donald Trump?
[03:11:22.693 --> 03:11:24.014]  There has been no evidence.
[03:11:24.014 --> 03:11:27.337]  There has actually been evidence to the contrary.
[03:11:27.337 --> 03:11:32.561]  That whatever investigation the FBI is doing appears to be... Now, I don't have the information either.
[03:11:33.969 --> 03:11:36.632]  Uh, what the FBI has and what they're investigating.
[03:11:36.632 --> 03:11:52.470]  But it appears to be, if you use a little of that deductive reasoning, it appears to be they're investigating how the Russians were able to obtain, uh, Democratic emails during, uh, the course of the election.
[03:11:53.431 --> 03:12:05.462]  And those, of course, we remember got out on WikiLeaks and we read about Podesta and Hillary and the emails, the questions from CNN that were going to Hillary.
[03:12:05.462 --> 03:12:14.430]  All this stuff that came out just showing how despicable and corrupt and criminal the Democrats are.
[03:12:15.729 --> 03:12:18.291]  That's what's being investigated.
[03:12:18.291 --> 03:12:20.433]  Now the left can spin this around.
[03:12:20.433 --> 03:12:22.054]  They're children.
[03:12:22.054 --> 03:12:28.338]  They think their mindset and their thought process is that of children.
[03:12:28.338 --> 03:12:35.604]  So they see this and think, well, it must be a treason investigation against Donald Trump.
[03:12:36.593 --> 03:12:42.476]  Again, not an iota of evidence supporting that.
[03:12:42.476 --> 03:12:51.501]  I have gone on record on Twitter offering people $1,000.
[03:12:51.501 --> 03:12:52.661]  $1,000 cash!
[03:12:52.661 --> 03:13:01.386]  If you can show me one piece of evidence that shows Donald Trump has been treasonous
[03:13:02.884 --> 03:13:10.026]  And I will even include his pre-presidential tenure as a businessman.
[03:13:10.026 --> 03:13:17.867]  Show me one iota of evidence where Donald Trump can be tried and convicted of treason.
[03:13:17.867 --> 03:13:20.168]  Do you understand what treason is?
[03:13:20.168 --> 03:13:27.509]  A president will be tried for treason.
[03:13:27.509 --> 03:13:29.830]  They're children.
[03:13:29.830 --> 03:13:30.950]  Drama queens.
[03:13:32.321 --> 03:13:44.265]  They see something and immediately jump to these conclusions, and then I get crap from them on Twitter saying, well, you don't have any evidence that he's innocent.
[03:13:44.265 --> 03:13:45.685]  Again, just childlike.
[03:13:45.685 --> 03:13:47.326]  It's adorable in a way.
[03:13:47.326 --> 03:13:50.127]  You look and just go, aw, you're so stupid.
[03:13:50.127 --> 03:13:53.308]  You're just so stupid.
[03:13:53.308 --> 03:13:59.090]  And they question that, and I answer back like, hey, none of us have anything.
[03:14:00.029 --> 03:14:10.604]  But it shows that there isn't any evidence out there yet showing that the president has done anything inappropriate as far as his campaign went and his presidency.
[03:14:11.641 --> 03:14:12.902]  Nothing.
[03:14:12.902 --> 03:14:17.445]  But that nothing to them is, it must be treason.
[03:14:17.445 --> 03:14:21.087]  The nothing to me is, I don't see any evidence of anything.
[03:14:21.087 --> 03:14:25.430]  And when I say that, oh, you'll support him no matter what!
[03:14:25.430 --> 03:14:30.054]  Yeah, I'm supporting him against baseless treason allegations.
[03:14:31.535 --> 03:14:45.868]  I would assume any American would want to defend the President of the United States, especially if you voted for him, but you'd want to defend any president against baseless accusations of treason!
[03:14:47.122 --> 03:14:59.649]  The highest crime that could possibly be committed by an American citizen, never mind the President of the United States, but they run with it.
[03:14:59.649 --> 03:15:08.033]  I liken them to children when you see a parent trying to get a child out of a Toys R Us.
[03:15:08.033 --> 03:15:08.834]  Isn't it sad to watch?
[03:15:12.663 --> 03:15:14.804]  I love his day!
[03:15:14.804 --> 03:15:17.486]  And the parent has to literally drag them out.
[03:15:17.486 --> 03:15:19.827]  That's how they're acting.
[03:15:19.827 --> 03:15:24.009]  And these, by the way, are the same people 24 hours before the election.
[03:15:29.303 --> 03:15:41.618]  24 hours before the election and the whole time before the election, but right up until the minute that he was elected, they were freaking out that Donald Trump
[03:15:42.734 --> 03:15:57.724]  Would not say he will absolutely accept the results of the election because of all the garbage that he had seen piled on top of him by the media and by the crooked Democrats over the course of the campaign.
[03:15:57.724 --> 03:16:08.892]  And he said, hey, I'm going to wait until I see the results of the election, see if they are legitimate, because there was a lot of allegations of illegal aliens voting and whatnot.
[03:16:08.892 --> 03:16:09.913]  So he wanted to see that.
[03:16:11.778 --> 03:16:15.660]  It was right after the election they started.
[03:16:15.660 --> 03:16:31.869]  They started after saying this would be unbelievably detrimental to our democracy if Donald Trump would not accept a democratically elected President of the United States knowing that at the time they were positive it was going to be Hillary Clinton.
[03:16:32.689 --> 03:16:38.350]  How dare you say you aren't sure or you want to wait and see?
[03:16:38.350 --> 03:16:53.973]  Well, right after the election, until right now, and well into the future, they have not accepted this election worse than any time ever in history.
[03:16:53.973 --> 03:17:01.255]  I have never seen a group of people lose their minds over an election, not accept it,
[03:17:02.532 --> 03:17:06.576]  Not accept the President and throw as many roadblocks as possible.
[03:17:06.576 --> 03:17:11.780]  And I'm not just talking about liberals, liberal citizens.
[03:17:11.780 --> 03:17:16.244]  I'm talking about politicians, the media.
[03:17:16.244 --> 03:17:25.192]  Oh my God, if you could sit in front of cable news, or God forbid, network news, does anyone even watch that anymore?
[03:17:25.192 --> 03:17:29.475]  But if you could sit in front of any cable news, and I'm including Fox in that these days,
[03:17:30.756 --> 03:17:36.618]  And actually believe that they're giving you the truth?
[03:17:36.618 --> 03:17:37.859]  Facts?
[03:17:37.859 --> 03:17:40.019]  You're out of your mind.
[03:17:40.019 --> 03:17:46.322]  You really need professional help if you think they're giving you the truth.
[03:17:46.322 --> 03:17:55.665]  I was, again, I'll bring up Twitter, in a discussion, a heated discussion with some people, and they started bringing up polls.
[03:17:55.665 --> 03:17:58.826]  Well, the polls say, and I had a laugh.
[03:17:59.486 --> 03:18:03.607]  I had to LOL.
[03:18:03.607 --> 03:18:06.128]  You're believing polls?
[03:18:06.128 --> 03:18:20.593]  After what the media did with their polling over the course of the campaign right up till the election, anyone that puts any stock in news polls again needs their head examined.
[03:18:20.593 --> 03:18:22.794]  But I believe if you're just a liberal,
[03:18:23.354 --> 03:18:25.375]  You really need your head examined.
[03:18:25.375 --> 03:18:26.215]  There it is.
[03:18:26.215 --> 03:18:29.936]  He created jobs is the funniest thing I've read today.
[03:18:29.936 --> 03:18:30.917]  So thanks for that.
[03:18:30.917 --> 03:18:35.018]  I'm sure those facts are the reason his poll numbers are plummeting.
[03:18:35.018 --> 03:18:39.899]  And I wrote, no, the funniest thing you read today is that you still have faith in news polls.
[03:18:39.899 --> 03:18:41.900]  That's the funny part.
[03:18:41.900 --> 03:18:44.061]  Because after what they did during the election,
[03:18:45.460 --> 03:18:50.325]  How do you put any faith in the news?
[03:18:50.325 --> 03:19:07.360]  And that's why alternative media, what's called alternative media now, which is becoming what people are going to for their factual news, are things like InfoWars.com and of course CompoundMedia.com.
[03:19:10.863 --> 03:19:16.249]  You watch that with this kind of mindset that you think you're getting the truth.
[03:19:16.249 --> 03:19:17.010]  You're not.
[03:19:17.010 --> 03:19:17.530]  You're not.
[03:19:17.530 --> 03:19:27.241]  The Comey firing... Another thing about the Comey firing was the Liberal Democrats saying, Wow, the timing is terrible.
[03:19:27.241 --> 03:19:30.744]  Please tell me when a good timing would have been that they wouldn't have complained.
[03:19:30.744 --> 03:19:31.785]  The day after the election?
[03:19:32.665 --> 03:19:33.886]  A month?
[03:19:33.886 --> 03:19:34.827]  Now?
[03:19:34.827 --> 03:19:41.793]  They're just gonna complain and set up roadblocks at every single thing that Donald Trump tries to do.
[03:19:41.793 --> 03:19:45.857]  And that is very counterproductive and un-American.
[03:19:45.857 --> 03:19:47.758]  We will be back in a moment.
[03:19:47.758 --> 03:19:49.280]  Don't you go anywhere.

[03:20:02.793 --> 03:20:05.895]  The following is a far too common tale of investing in annuities.
[03:20:05.895 --> 03:20:12.919]  A successful couple invested a large portion of their savings in annuities, thinking they were a safe way to guarantee a dependable income stream no matter what the market did.
[03:20:12.919 --> 03:20:15.120]  But it didn't take long for them to regret their decision.
[03:20:15.120 --> 03:20:21.423]  They were locked into low returns, faced potential tax consequences, and that they couldn't get out of their annuities without paying huge penalties.
[03:20:21.423 --> 03:20:23.204]  They were stuck, and so was their money.
[03:20:23.204 --> 03:20:25.585]  Suddenly, their retirement hopes and dreams were in danger.
[03:20:25.585 --> 03:20:26.846]  But it didn't have to happen to them.
[03:20:26.946 --> 03:20:27.206]  I think so.

[03:25:09.845 --> 03:25:16.467]  It's crazy stuff, but I'm sure it's amazing, amazing for you, for your male vitality.
[03:25:16.467 --> 03:25:21.648]  I want to touch a little more on the Comey firing here.
[03:25:21.648 --> 03:25:22.809]  It really is astounding.
[03:25:22.809 --> 03:25:31.851]  You watch the Democrats, and I'm talking Chuck Schumer, and this Maxine Waters is a cartoon character.
[03:25:31.851 --> 03:25:33.571]  She's a cartoon!
[03:25:33.571 --> 03:25:35.292]  You watch her, and it's like, what is this?
[03:25:36.952 --> 03:25:40.036]  She's out of her mind.
[03:25:40.036 --> 03:25:50.207]  These, by the way, the same people that were clamoring, just calling for the firing of Director Comey.
[03:25:51.690 --> 03:25:56.575]  The entire time after the election.
[03:25:56.575 --> 03:26:07.305]  Once he put those papers out about Hillary's email and Huma and Anthony Weiner and people said it changed the course of the election.
[03:26:08.186 --> 03:26:12.147]  The Democrats have been trying to oust this guy.
[03:26:12.147 --> 03:26:13.627]  They wanted him out.
[03:26:13.627 --> 03:26:15.327]  He was a traitor to them.
[03:26:15.327 --> 03:26:18.248]  Treasonous, mind you.
[03:26:18.248 --> 03:26:21.949]  And fired was one of the nicer things they said.
[03:26:21.949 --> 03:26:25.970]  Some people were actually advocating his execution.
[03:26:25.970 --> 03:26:28.310]  Some people wanted him imprisoned.
[03:26:28.310 --> 03:26:30.591]  Others wanted him completely off the planet.
[03:26:30.591 --> 03:26:34.952]  I don't know how that would work, but that's what we saw.
[03:26:34.952 --> 03:26:36.992]  And then Trump fires him.
[03:26:38.504 --> 03:26:40.145]  And they lose their minds.
[03:26:40.145 --> 03:26:43.107]  They just lose their minds.
[03:26:43.107 --> 03:26:53.035]  Saying that this is an awful thing, like we need a special prosecutor to step up and investigate what we have seen as nothing.
[03:26:53.035 --> 03:26:57.858]  Yeah, Hillary herself has asked for the ouster of Comey.
[03:26:57.858 --> 03:26:59.440]  Comey wouldn't have lasted a day.
[03:27:00.280 --> 03:27:04.522]  If Hillary Clinton did win the election.
[03:27:04.522 --> 03:27:12.407]  But between Hillary and Bill, it really is amazing that everything the Democrats are railing Trump about
[03:27:13.849 --> 03:27:16.611]  Is old hat for the Clintons.
[03:27:16.611 --> 03:27:17.672]  Old hat.
[03:27:17.672 --> 03:27:22.896]  This firing of an FBI director is unprecedented by Donald Trump.
[03:27:22.896 --> 03:27:23.397]  Really?
[03:27:23.397 --> 03:27:25.198]  You know who else did that?
[03:27:25.198 --> 03:27:26.759]  Bill Clinton.
[03:27:26.759 --> 03:27:31.603]  Bill Clinton fired his FBI director.
[03:27:31.603 --> 03:27:34.485]  So it's not unprecedented.
[03:27:34.485 --> 03:27:36.707]  Russian ties, Russian ties.
[03:27:36.707 --> 03:27:38.128]  Oh boy, who did that?
[03:27:38.128 --> 03:27:38.949]  Hillary Clinton.
[03:27:40.131 --> 03:27:48.617]  The reset button, the turning over of plutonium, uranium, to the Russians.
[03:27:48.617 --> 03:27:50.678]  They did it before!
[03:27:50.678 --> 03:27:54.241]  You know, I can see Bill sitting there, like, reading all this stuff.
[03:27:54.241 --> 03:27:56.162]  Hey, Hillary, look at this.
[03:27:56.162 --> 03:27:59.824]  They say Donald Trump is a sexual deviant.
[03:27:59.824 --> 03:28:00.585]  I got that one.
[03:28:00.585 --> 03:28:01.105]  That was me.
[03:28:03.041 --> 03:28:05.362]  Let's see, criminal corruption?
[03:28:05.362 --> 03:28:07.623]  That's you and me.
[03:28:07.623 --> 03:28:08.943]  We both did that.
[03:28:08.943 --> 03:28:10.284]  What else do we got here?
[03:28:10.284 --> 03:28:11.324]  Russian ties?
[03:28:11.324 --> 03:28:13.685]  Well, you're good at that one.
[03:28:13.685 --> 03:28:17.046]  And then I get a lot for speech when I've spoken.
[03:28:17.046 --> 03:28:20.067]  They just, they have everything tied up.
[03:28:20.067 --> 03:28:21.708]  They've done it all.
[03:28:21.708 --> 03:28:32.472]  Whatever you could accuse Donald Trump of doing with zero evidence, the Clintons have done it with a propensity of evidence and escaped unscathed.
[03:28:33.627 --> 03:28:36.329]  No special prosecutor?
[03:28:36.329 --> 03:28:46.215]  There should have been a special prosecutor with Hillary, with her server, and the emails, and forwarding to Huma and then Anthony Weiner.
[03:28:46.215 --> 03:28:50.677]  Why wasn't that looked at by a special prosecutor?
[03:28:50.677 --> 03:29:00.844]  When Lynch and Clinton met on the runway during an active investigation against Hillary Clinton about those emails,
[03:29:02.532 --> 03:29:04.194]  Why wasn't there a special prosecutor?
[03:29:04.194 --> 03:29:07.979]  Because there was a conflict of interest there.
[03:29:07.979 --> 03:29:15.428]  And you couldn't imagine Lynch was going to be impartial when she's having a secretive meeting that was only discovered because someone from the media was there.
[03:29:17.760 --> 03:29:19.060]  Where was the special prosecutor there?
[03:29:19.060 --> 03:29:22.441]  Where were the calls for treason at that point?
[03:29:22.441 --> 03:29:23.741]  We didn't see anything.
[03:29:23.741 --> 03:29:28.202]  They're all phonies, liars, and manipulators.
[03:29:28.202 --> 03:29:39.705]  The media, the left, and the Democrats because they are just going to slow down everything Donald Trump wants to do to actually build this country back up to greatness.
[03:29:39.705 --> 03:29:41.085]  And we got to sit here and take it?
[03:29:41.085 --> 03:29:41.845]  No we don't.
[03:29:42.465 --> 03:29:43.145]  No, we don't.
[03:29:43.145 --> 03:29:49.789]  Anthony Comea, for InfoWars.com, we will be back in a matter of seconds.
[03:29:49.789 --> 03:29:53.731]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.731 --> 03:29:56.412]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.757 --> 03:30:05.541]  Last week, a study was released showing the differences between vaccinated kids and non-vaccinated kids.
[03:30:05.541 --> 03:30:11.045]  Infowars.com covered this, pointing out the pushback of these studies being censored, while more pushback has begun.
[03:30:11.045 --> 03:30:18.571]  The Boston Herald published an editorial from the entire editorial staff, which is now calling for anyone pushing anti-vaccine rhetoric to be hung.
[03:30:18.571 --> 03:30:25.156]  The well-written legal speak quote is, Lying to vulnerable people about the health and safety of their children ought to be a hanging offense.
[03:30:25.376 --> 03:30:31.440]  This after insinuating that anti-vaccine people are responsible for a measles outbreak in a Somali community in Minnesota.
[03:30:31.440 --> 03:30:37.183]  This story claims as fact vaccines don't cause autism when some have it already listed as a side effect.
[03:30:37.183 --> 03:30:41.626]  Of course the irony of their statement regarding hanging people who lie about the health and safety of children
[03:30:41.886 --> 03:30:50.549]  ...is it ultimately would fall back on them if they do indeed promote the idea that vaccines cannot be linked to autism, a blatant lie about the health and safety of children.
[03:30:50.549 --> 03:30:57.991]  My guess is this same editorial staff would support abortion, but somehow they don't believe that is a threat to the lives and safety of children.
[03:30:57.991 --> 03:31:00.272]  For InfoWars.com, this is Owen Schroer.
[03:31:00.572 --> 03:31:05.634]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.

[03:32:00.382 --> 03:32:05.783]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:32:05.783 --> 03:32:08.624]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[03:32:08.624 --> 03:32:10.604]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[03:32:10.604 --> 03:32:15.625]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[03:32:15.625 --> 03:32:17.726]  Research across the board is clear.
[03:32:17.726 --> 03:32:19.006]  In fact, it's certified.
[03:32:19.006 --> 03:32:24.127]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[03:32:24.127 --> 03:32:27.488]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[03:32:27.648 --> 03:32:28.209]  We're good to go.
[03:32:55.230 --> 03:32:55.810]  Thank you, thank you.
[03:33:25.501 --> 03:33:31.725]  I was checking up on the old Obamacare news, this healthcare thing.
[03:33:31.725 --> 03:33:34.406]  Again, Twitter, I can't stay off of it.
[03:33:34.406 --> 03:33:35.007]  I don't know why.
[03:33:35.007 --> 03:33:37.028]  I should just delete the account.
[03:33:37.028 --> 03:33:38.789]  It would make my life so much simpler.
[03:33:40.290 --> 03:33:42.331]  You get dragged right back in.
[03:33:42.331 --> 03:33:54.477]  The healthcare issue, and Obamacare as it was called, have you seen how many carriers are falling out of this thing?
[03:33:54.477 --> 03:33:56.438]  Because they're going broke?
[03:33:56.438 --> 03:34:00.300]  It's everything that the Republicans said that would happen is coming to fruition.
[03:34:01.721 --> 03:34:03.762]  It's insurance, first of all.
[03:34:03.762 --> 03:34:05.162]  Let's get that straight.
[03:34:05.162 --> 03:34:12.204]  I had to actually get on Twitter and tell people the Affordable Health Care Act is insurance.
[03:34:12.204 --> 03:34:13.445]  That's all it is.
[03:34:13.445 --> 03:34:16.066]  It has nothing to do with health care.
[03:34:16.066 --> 03:34:22.468]  It's paying for health care and how you figure that out and manage that.
[03:34:22.468 --> 03:34:29.890]  So I posted something because, of course, one of the big sticky wickets with this whole thing was pre-existing conditions.
[03:34:31.243 --> 03:34:33.705]  Now, I'm not a heartless ogre.
[03:34:33.705 --> 03:34:36.187]  I don't think anybody is, really, when it comes to this.
[03:34:36.187 --> 03:34:41.231]  They don't want to keep people from getting good health care.
[03:34:41.231 --> 03:34:50.839]  But you cannot call insurance insurance if you're paying for pre-existing conditions.
[03:34:50.839 --> 03:34:52.160]  It just won't work.
[03:34:52.160 --> 03:34:55.843]  And I use the example of a burning house
[03:34:56.809 --> 03:35:11.601]  When you're buying homeowner's insurance, if your house is on fire, you can't say my house has a pre-existing condition, I'd like to pay one premium for a couple hundred dollars and then I would really appreciate if you rebuilt my house because I'm insured now.
[03:35:11.601 --> 03:35:15.304]  Now, it's the same thing with health insurance.
[03:35:15.304 --> 03:35:21.349]  You can't not get insurance and then go to the company when you're diagnosed with something
[03:35:22.540 --> 03:35:36.307]  Pay a premium for even $1,500, whatever these premiums are up to these days, and then expect the insurance company to dole out hundreds of thousands of dollars to take care of you.
[03:35:37.555 --> 03:35:42.840]  It's a social welfare program, is what it turns into at that point.
[03:35:42.840 --> 03:35:45.622]  It's no longer insurance.
[03:35:45.622 --> 03:35:51.127]  Insurance needs people paying in and not taking out.
[03:35:51.127 --> 03:35:52.988]  That is like their goal.
[03:35:52.988 --> 03:35:58.252]  And even when you buy insurance, you're actually hoping you never need it.
[03:35:58.252 --> 03:36:02.596]  You wouldn't hope and go, boy, I've been paying into this insurance policy for 10 years.
[03:36:02.596 --> 03:36:04.057]  I really wish I got sick.
[03:36:05.238 --> 03:36:08.141]  Oh, I sure hope I get into a car accident.
[03:36:08.141 --> 03:36:13.486]  I sure hope my house burns down, because I've been paying a lot of money and I want to see something for it.
[03:36:15.740 --> 03:36:21.263]  Insurance is the only thing I think you pay into hoping you never see the rewards of it.
[03:36:21.263 --> 03:36:24.685]  So in essence, it's almost like a social program.
[03:36:24.685 --> 03:36:34.230]  You're paying in, sick people are taking what is in essence your money from this group of funds and taking care of themselves.
[03:36:34.230 --> 03:36:36.292]  That's how it works.
[03:36:36.292 --> 03:36:39.573]  And you hope you never need it.
[03:36:39.573 --> 03:36:43.316]  But then, you put in pre-existing conditions
[03:36:44.344 --> 03:36:47.206]  And now you don't have to pay into it.
[03:36:47.206 --> 03:36:52.149]  At the last minute, you could pay into it and now take out a hell of a lot of money.
[03:36:52.149 --> 03:36:54.071]  Well, these insurance companies are going broke.
[03:36:54.071 --> 03:36:59.154]  This wasn't some type of thing you needed to be an economist to figure out.
[03:36:59.154 --> 03:37:05.618]  You didn't need to be a genius, a math whiz, an actuary.
[03:37:05.618 --> 03:37:13.864]  Everyone knew this simple principle that insurance company needs people to pay in more than they're taking out.
[03:37:14.864 --> 03:37:20.567]  And once that stopped, these insurance companies were going broke and backing out of Obamacare.
[03:37:20.567 --> 03:37:28.311]  Now, how people have decided they want pre-existing conditions to be paid for, there's a few options on the table.
[03:37:28.311 --> 03:37:37.596]  I kind of like the pool of people with pre-existing conditions having to pay in to a separate insurance policy.
[03:37:37.596 --> 03:37:40.658]  I think that works well, but if you think
[03:37:42.296 --> 03:37:52.455]  Some 60-year-old guy with a pre-existing condition should be paying the same amount of money as a 20-year-old.
[03:37:52.455 --> 03:37:53.938]  That's the picture of health.
[03:37:53.938 --> 03:37:54.679]  You're out of your mind!
[03:37:56.271 --> 03:38:02.193]  I have, with my car insurance, I have a pre-existing condition.
[03:38:02.193 --> 03:38:04.294]  I love to drive fast.
[03:38:04.294 --> 03:38:14.238]  I have so many speeding tickets, and my insurance bill reflects my pre-existing condition that I like to drive fast.
[03:38:14.238 --> 03:38:23.962]  Should I have to pay, or should a woman, let's say a woman that drives a Prius, never had an accident or a ticket, should she have to pay the same rate I pay?
[03:38:25.425 --> 03:38:26.006]  No!
[03:38:26.006 --> 03:38:29.269]  It's ridiculous to expect that!
[03:38:29.269 --> 03:38:39.780]  So, people that are bitching about this are, again, being emotional and unrealistic about the whole thing.
[03:38:39.780 --> 03:38:46.307]  And most people don't even know what Trump's or Trump's administration's new healthcare
[03:38:47.448 --> 03:38:48.809]  Legislation is.
[03:38:48.809 --> 03:38:50.870]  Yet they're just lambasting it.
[03:38:50.870 --> 03:38:54.331]  Because he's Trump and you gotta just bash Trump.
[03:38:54.331 --> 03:38:58.493]  That's what you do if you're on the left or you're a Democrat.
[03:38:58.493 --> 03:39:01.394]  You just gotta get in there and bash Trump.
[03:39:01.394 --> 03:39:02.995]  I don't have the answers.
[03:39:02.995 --> 03:39:03.395]  What am I?
[03:39:03.395 --> 03:39:04.735]  A talk show host?
[03:39:04.735 --> 03:39:05.916]  I don't have the answers.
[03:39:06.576 --> 03:39:13.383]  But I know what insurance is, and I know what it isn't, and I know how they make money and how they won't make money.
[03:39:13.383 --> 03:39:21.310]  And that's pretty much all you have to know to know that Obamacare was going to be a bust the second it was signed before anyone read it.
[03:39:21.310 --> 03:39:22.351]  Remember that?
[03:39:22.351 --> 03:39:25.674]  Well, we have to sign it before we read it.
[03:39:25.674 --> 03:39:26.555]  What are you, crazy?
[03:39:26.555 --> 03:39:29.097]  Who is that, Nancy Pelosi, another maniac?
[03:39:29.980 --> 03:39:31.481]  You see her talk?
[03:39:31.481 --> 03:39:35.902]  Her eyes are spinning like when a cartoon character is trying to hypnotize you.
[03:39:35.902 --> 03:39:36.862]  She's a maniac!
[03:39:36.862 --> 03:39:43.685]  I mean, other things that annoyed me today.
[03:39:43.685 --> 03:39:50.587]  Betsy DeVos, of course, she is the Secretary of Education appointed by Donald Trump.
[03:39:50.587 --> 03:39:55.149]  She was speaking, delivering the commencement address
[03:39:56.662 --> 03:40:03.028]  At Bethune-Cookman University, a historically black college in Florida, on Wednesday.
[03:40:03.028 --> 03:40:07.733]  And she was ABOOD!
[03:40:07.733 --> 03:40:20.365]  She accepts this honor of giving the commencement address, goes up there, here's a woman who's dedicating her life to public service and education.
[03:40:22.046 --> 03:40:29.289]  And she is crapped on by the graduating class.
[03:40:29.289 --> 03:40:33.190]  And I believe race has a huge part in this.
[03:40:33.190 --> 03:40:42.294]  I don't think if it was a black woman that was picked as Secretary of Education, I don't believe they would have acted like this.
[03:40:42.294 --> 03:40:44.115]  But more so, it's Trump.
[03:40:44.875 --> 03:40:46.196]  One of Trump's appointments.
[03:40:46.196 --> 03:40:53.240]  So regardless of what this woman wants to do to improve education in this country, they will boo her.
[03:40:53.240 --> 03:40:59.703]  These are supposedly educated, college-educated students here.
[03:40:59.703 --> 03:41:10.029]  I like the fact that one of the administrators behind her, I believe it was even the president of the school, he got up there and said,
[03:41:11.790 --> 03:41:15.431]  If you keep this up, we'll be mailing you your diplomas.
[03:41:15.431 --> 03:41:25.213]  You could have no celebration, no graduation, no graduation, and you're going home and you'll get your diploma in the mail.
[03:41:25.213 --> 03:41:29.934]  But this is the kind of thing that we see in colleges.
[03:41:29.934 --> 03:41:35.716]  Colleges are just a bastion of liberal muck.
[03:41:35.716 --> 03:41:39.297]  I've never seen, since maybe the 60s,
[03:41:41.017 --> 03:41:54.480]  And I wasn't alive around them, but I remember seeing some stuff on the news afterwards and even later in the 60s when I was a little tater tot, little kid, I remember watching the news and hearing my dad bitching about the hippies all the time.
[03:41:54.480 --> 03:41:55.360]  Ah, the hippies!
[03:41:55.360 --> 03:41:58.181]  What are they doing, the hippies?
[03:41:58.181 --> 03:42:05.282]  And in hindsight, you know, it seemed like even if you didn't agree with them, they were trying to do something.
[03:42:05.282 --> 03:42:07.662]  They were trying to end a war.
[03:42:07.662 --> 03:42:10.063]  And they seemed to have some kind of focus.
[03:42:11.136 --> 03:42:17.079]  And in order to really demonstrate and be passionate about demonstrating back then, you had to show up.
[03:42:17.079 --> 03:42:25.303]  You really had to make a commitment to leave your house, go to another city, and do something.
[03:42:26.825 --> 03:42:43.642]  What we have now are hashtag warriors and slacktivists and people that change their their passions on a hourly basis about what they they feel is important for them to get involved in and by involved it's literally just just
[03:42:44.543 --> 03:42:47.926]  Instagramming something or tweeting something.
[03:42:47.926 --> 03:42:52.289]  There's no real work behind it.
[03:42:52.289 --> 03:43:03.216]  So, nowadays, on college campuses, you have what amounts to infringement on freedom of speech.
[03:43:03.216 --> 03:43:05.498]  As it's going on.
[03:43:05.498 --> 03:43:06.799]  There's no other way to put it.
[03:43:07.932 --> 03:43:15.678]  When the likes of Ann Coulter wants to speak at Berkeley, she is denied.
[03:43:15.678 --> 03:43:16.398]  Denied.
[03:43:16.398 --> 03:43:18.920]  And they say there's safety issues.
[03:43:18.920 --> 03:43:20.881]  Well, you have a police department.
[03:43:20.881 --> 03:43:23.523]  The college has its own police department.
[03:43:23.523 --> 03:43:24.944]  Figure it out.
[03:43:24.944 --> 03:43:33.330]  Why can't someone speak giving a dissenting viewpoint of the majority of the students there?
[03:43:33.330 --> 03:43:35.392]  She was invited by Republicans.
[03:43:36.616 --> 03:43:38.859]  Students that wanted to hear her speak.
[03:43:38.859 --> 03:43:48.413]  And the left, and the Antifa, and the liberals on campus decided, decided for you!
[03:43:49.890 --> 03:43:51.552]  What you should or shouldn't hear.
[03:43:51.552 --> 03:43:53.153]  That's what they said.
[03:43:53.153 --> 03:43:54.174]  Ann Coulter?
[03:43:54.174 --> 03:43:55.035]  No.
[03:43:55.035 --> 03:43:59.619]  We're gonna decide that you shouldn't hear what she has to say.
[03:43:59.619 --> 03:44:01.140]  Is that okay?
[03:44:01.140 --> 03:44:09.848]  And then you say, well, that doesn't really go well with the whole notion of our First Amendment right, freedom of speech, freedom of expression.
[03:44:09.848 --> 03:44:13.972]  And they say, yeah, no, that's not freedom of speech because it's hate speech.
[03:44:15.276 --> 03:44:24.250]  They get to label whatever they deem hate speech as hate speech and then get to say you can't hear it because they have determined it.
[03:44:24.250 --> 03:44:29.357]  It is the definition of fascism and we see it happening all over.
[03:44:30.517 --> 03:44:33.419]  On college campuses.
[03:44:33.419 --> 03:44:41.824]  There are courses about white privilege and against conservatives.
[03:44:41.824 --> 03:44:45.627]  Every conservative to a liberal student is a Nazi.
[03:44:45.627 --> 03:44:53.912]  And we see what's happening down south with Confederate monuments.
[03:44:53.912 --> 03:44:56.774]  That's another big issue right now.
[03:44:56.774 --> 03:44:58.275]  Do you really think taking down
[03:44:59.310 --> 03:45:05.632]  A monument to Robert E. Lee is going to stop anything?
[03:45:05.632 --> 03:45:06.952]  Any violence?
[03:45:06.952 --> 03:45:09.473]  It's going to change people's opinions about things?
[03:45:09.473 --> 03:45:11.753]  It's going to make us get along better?
[03:45:11.753 --> 03:45:20.056]  Or is it just a way to reconstruct history with somebody else's point of view?
[03:45:20.056 --> 03:45:24.177]  I saw on Twitter quite a few posts about
[03:45:25.322 --> 03:45:33.358]  Well, we don't need statues to revere these horrible, traitorous people that fought in the Civil War against the United States.
[03:45:34.452 --> 03:45:37.953]  If you want to learn about them, there are museums for that.
[03:45:37.953 --> 03:45:40.594]  Or movies and documentaries and stuff.
[03:45:40.594 --> 03:45:50.058]  Well, I really don't want to see someone else's opinion of those people and that time and that war and history.
[03:45:50.058 --> 03:45:59.682]  I want to be able to look, perhaps be inspired to do my own research and look at who these people were.
[03:45:59.682 --> 03:46:00.342]  What they did.
[03:46:01.605 --> 03:46:12.893]  And it would encourage you to read more and use your own mind to make your own opinions on history.
[03:46:12.893 --> 03:46:15.995]  Not be shoved into a museum with someone else's dialogue.
[03:46:15.995 --> 03:46:20.739]  New Orleans removes Confederate President Jefferson Davis statue.
[03:46:20.739 --> 03:46:22.120]  Why?
[03:46:22.120 --> 03:46:24.041]  What will this do in New Orleans?
[03:46:24.041 --> 03:46:29.085]  New Orleans is rivaling Chicago for the amount of gun deaths
[03:46:30.598 --> 03:46:38.763]  And do you really think taking Jefferson Davis' statue down is going to do anything to improve anyone's life down there?
[03:46:38.763 --> 03:46:46.348]  Or is it purely a political move to again put in this revisionist history that we see?
[03:46:46.348 --> 03:46:49.029]  I have opinions about
[03:46:50.526 --> 03:46:51.326]  About every war.
[03:46:51.326 --> 03:46:53.727]  I have opinions about every war.
[03:46:53.727 --> 03:46:55.167]  I do my research.
[03:46:55.167 --> 03:46:56.288]  I read a lot.
[03:46:56.288 --> 03:47:09.372]  And from what I gather on the Civil War, regardless of what you feel, if they were monsters on the South, if they were soldiers just fighting, they were men who felt passionate about defending their brethren.
[03:47:09.372 --> 03:47:16.114]  They took to a field of battle with other people and fought for something they believed in.
[03:47:16.114 --> 03:47:19.255]  Why should you take a bulldozer to that?
[03:47:20.447 --> 03:47:27.551]  Shouldn't you leave that there so that you can be inspired to learn more about it on your own?
[03:47:27.551 --> 03:47:34.075]  Instead of now just an empty space to walk over like it never happened?
[03:47:34.075 --> 03:47:44.942]  I see a lot of what ISIS is doing in the Middle East, tearing down Christianity and churches and monuments that aren't Islamic.
[03:47:44.942 --> 03:47:45.783]  What's the difference?
[03:47:46.812 --> 03:47:48.033]  Oh, they're using sledgehammers.
[03:47:48.033 --> 03:47:50.814]  We have some heavy machinery.
[03:47:50.814 --> 03:47:52.114]  I don't see the difference, though.
[03:47:52.114 --> 03:48:00.697]  If you try to cover up your own history, it's never good.
[03:48:00.697 --> 03:48:03.899]  It always starts repeating itself.
[03:48:03.899 --> 03:48:09.181]  I think having these monuments there is needed.
[03:48:10.222 --> 03:48:11.423]  It absolutely is.
[03:48:11.423 --> 03:48:14.066]  I don't think it's a good idea.
[03:48:14.066 --> 03:48:31.145]  And it's been turned into a very political issue, a racial issue, even a financial issue, because I hear the guy that's opening up this slavery museum wants to take these monuments and display them in the museum.
[03:48:32.688 --> 03:48:38.512]  And we have a mayor who is making money off of this.
[03:48:38.512 --> 03:48:42.234]  Like, isn't that crazy and corrupt?
[03:48:43.579 --> 03:48:54.966]  And if it's put in a museum that is owned by somebody that has his own ideology about things, isn't it going to be presented in that way?
[03:48:54.966 --> 03:48:59.649]  As something evil, or something good, if it's something else.
[03:48:59.649 --> 03:49:02.891]  You're not going to be able to cultivate your own opinion.
[03:49:04.086 --> 03:49:05.846]  Because of the way things are presented.
[03:49:05.846 --> 03:49:08.387]  Same thing as with the fake news.
[03:49:08.387 --> 03:49:13.768]  They absolutely drill things in people's heads and you read it on social media constantly.
[03:49:13.768 --> 03:49:17.629]  People that believe something happened when it never happened.
[03:49:17.629 --> 03:49:29.011]  Because it was bashed into their head ad nauseum and when you try to debate it with fact, they say you don't know what you're talking about.
[03:49:29.011 --> 03:49:29.891]  I don't like that.
[03:49:29.891 --> 03:49:32.472]  I like being able to make our own decisions
[03:49:33.658 --> 03:49:36.460]  Look at the world, good or bad.
[03:49:36.460 --> 03:49:37.901]  Don't cover it up.
[03:49:37.901 --> 03:49:48.069]  I like looking at some of the, some of the disgraces that we've had as a nation, perhaps, and making our own assumptions about it.
[03:49:48.069 --> 03:49:50.290]  There's no reason to cover it up.
[03:49:50.290 --> 03:49:52.012]  Again, purely political.
[03:49:52.012 --> 03:49:55.735]  Won't do anything.
[03:49:55.735 --> 03:49:58.617]  And that's pretty much where I stand on that one.
[03:49:58.617 --> 03:50:02.620]  And quickly, before we take a break, I want to get into this
[03:50:03.866 --> 03:50:09.069]  Security guard, ex-security guard in Boston, who murdered two doctors.
[03:50:09.069 --> 03:50:18.655]  Murdered two doctors in their townhouse, slit their throats.
[03:50:18.655 --> 03:50:20.957]  And this guy had been in trouble before.
[03:50:22.808 --> 03:50:27.192]  A judge went lenient on him, went a little lenient on this guy.
[03:50:27.192 --> 03:50:29.854]  He was an immigrant, a legal immigrant.
[03:50:29.854 --> 03:50:37.481]  He came over here, I guess got through the process and murdered two doctors.
[03:50:37.481 --> 03:50:42.865]  Just people contributing to society, murders them.
[03:50:42.865 --> 03:50:48.170]  And it never should have happened because we have judges that are criminal.
[03:50:49.252 --> 03:50:50.933]  That are criminal.
[03:50:50.933 --> 03:50:54.074]  We'll be back with that story in just a few minutes.
[03:50:54.074 --> 03:50:55.114]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:50:55.114 --> 03:51:00.636]  Anthony Cumia in for InfoWars.com.
[03:51:00.636 --> 03:51:03.697]  Extendivite is more than just a heart tonic.
[03:51:03.697 --> 03:51:05.758]  Do you have any of these symptoms?
[03:51:05.758 --> 03:51:07.578]  Night cramps in the hands and feet.
[03:51:07.578 --> 03:51:09.799]  Your arms and legs often go to sleep.
[03:51:09.799 --> 03:51:12.500]  On short walks, do your legs get aches and pains?
[03:51:12.500 --> 03:51:14.641]  Is your memory worse than it used to be?
[03:51:14.641 --> 03:51:16.521]  Ankles that swell late in the day.
[03:51:16.521 --> 03:51:18.242]  Has your blood pressure increased lately?
[03:51:18.542 --> 03:51:25.125]  If you answered yes to even one of these questions, you may have early warning signs of arterial blockages.
[03:51:25.125 --> 03:51:28.546]  Your body is saying that it is time to take Xtendivite.
[03:51:28.546 --> 03:51:30.827]  These are not the normal signs of aging.
[03:51:30.827 --> 03:51:34.148]  They are the warning signs that accompany blocked arteries.
[03:51:34.148 --> 03:51:36.089]  Get your Xtendivite today!

[03:51:49.297 --> 03:51:52.401]  Let's go to Devon in Florida.
[03:51:52.401 --> 03:51:57.689]  Devon in Florida, you're on the air.
[03:52:04.744 --> 03:52:05.224]  Great!
[03:52:05.224 --> 03:52:06.344]  Hey, thank you so much.
[03:52:06.344 --> 03:52:10.966]  Listen, I have bought your products, and I gotta say they're amazing.
[03:52:10.966 --> 03:52:12.726]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[03:52:12.726 --> 03:52:21.368]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swell, Plymouth Interfusion, I've got the Body Armor... Wow, thank you.
[03:52:21.368 --> 03:52:23.749]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[03:52:23.749 --> 03:52:25.349]  Which nutraceutical does he like best?
[03:52:25.589 --> 03:52:29.150]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[03:52:29.150 --> 03:52:29.570]  That's amazing.
[03:52:29.570 --> 03:52:30.470]  That's really incredible.
[03:52:30.470 --> 03:52:33.591]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[03:52:33.591 --> 03:52:34.952]  Like, I haven't felt this week.
[03:52:34.952 --> 03:52:36.652]  My morning was fantastic.
[03:52:36.652 --> 03:52:37.832]  And I love you guys.
[03:52:37.832 --> 03:52:40.173]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[03:52:40.173 --> 03:52:47.155]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[03:52:47.155 --> 03:52:48.235]  You will love it.
[03:52:48.235 --> 03:52:48.756]  I'm telling you.
[03:52:48.756 --> 03:52:50.116]  I've never bought a bad product.

[03:55:48.840 --> 03:55:49.461]  Uh, yeah.
[03:55:49.461 --> 03:55:56.632]  Well, it turns out this, uh, ex-security guard charged with murder, uh, of, uh, two Boston doctors was, um...
[03:55:58.052 --> 03:55:59.953]  Well, could have been deported.
[03:55:59.953 --> 03:56:02.695]  He had robbed two banks!
[03:56:02.695 --> 03:56:05.557]  He robbed, or robbed the same bank twice, I think!
[03:56:05.557 --> 03:56:10.101]  That's always a sign of a brain surgeon.
[03:56:10.101 --> 03:56:14.584]  He's, uh, Bam-pum-min, Bam-pum-min?
[03:56:14.584 --> 03:56:17.206]  Is his name Bam-pum-min Teixeira?
[03:56:19.117 --> 03:56:19.517]  Uh, 30.
[03:56:19.517 --> 03:56:20.678]  Charges two counts of murder.
[03:56:20.678 --> 03:56:24.702]  Um, he slipped two doctors' throats.
[03:56:24.702 --> 03:56:29.025]  What a... I bet those doctors wish they had a gun at the time.
[03:56:29.025 --> 03:56:34.390]  Boy, every time you hear about people, um, saying, uh, oh, guns, they're terrible.
[03:56:34.390 --> 03:56:37.973]  I bet when you're in that position, you're like, damn, I want a gun real bad.
[03:56:37.973 --> 03:56:40.576]  It's the one thing I want right now is a gun.
[03:56:41.792 --> 03:56:46.193]  Well, this guy murdered them, and it turns out he'd been in trouble with the law before.
[03:56:46.193 --> 03:56:50.434]  When he robbed the... He had two bank robberies.
[03:56:50.434 --> 03:57:04.798]  The judge, who he was before, took into account that if he had been charged with that second bank robbery and given time, more time than I believe a year, he would have been deported.
[03:57:04.798 --> 03:57:07.878]  And we'd have been shut of this guy.
[03:57:07.878 --> 03:57:09.979]  But the judge gave him just under
[03:57:10.982 --> 03:57:15.705]  What it would have taken to deport him.
[03:57:15.705 --> 03:57:16.926]  Why?
[03:57:16.926 --> 03:57:18.887]  What is the upside?
[03:57:18.887 --> 03:57:26.691]  This is my argument when I talk about illegal immigration too and all the people that want in sanctuary cities.
[03:57:26.691 --> 03:57:36.017]  What is the upside to this country to allow people to come here that are murderers and rapists?
[03:57:38.064 --> 03:57:39.265]  I don't see it.
[03:57:39.265 --> 03:57:43.566]  And if one is here, why don't we try real hard to get him out?
[03:57:43.566 --> 03:57:52.991]  And if he's handed to the judicial system, why would you try to not get him out of the country?
[03:57:52.991 --> 03:57:54.371]  I don't understand this.
[03:57:54.371 --> 03:57:58.033]  Again, a liberal mental illness.
[03:57:58.033 --> 03:58:00.294]  This judge could have gotten rid
[03:58:01.207 --> 03:58:12.868]  of a guy that ended up murdering two amazingly productive members of society, at the least, and at the most, family and friends of people.
[03:58:14.043 --> 03:58:18.726]  Who dedicated their lives to medicine and helping people.
[03:58:18.726 --> 03:58:30.754]  And that was snuffed out because a judge felt it was within her power to keep a criminal here in this country when he could have been excised.
[03:58:30.754 --> 03:58:32.155]  Thank you for watching.
