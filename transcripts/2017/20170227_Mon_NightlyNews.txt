[00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:20.353]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.593 --> 00:00:21.254]  I'm David Knight.

[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:47.389]  Barack Obama robbed Fannie and Freddie to pay Obamacare as federal court litigation proves once and for all that the Obama administration illegally diverted taxpayer funds to keep Obamacare from imploding.

[00:00:48.490 --> 00:01:03.723]  President Donald Trump has big plans for tomorrow, but that does not include big government, as he proposes $54 billion in cuts to most federal agencies and a huge increase in military spending.
[00:01:03.903 --> 00:01:13.751]  Plus, render unto the Pope the things which belong to Pope Francis, because the Vatican wants to copyright the Pope's merchandise.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:02.301 --> 00:03:04.663]  We've all heard about robbing Peter to pay Paul.
[00:03:04.703 --> 00:03:12.088]  We're going to tell you a story about how Obama robbed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to fund Obamacare.
[00:03:12.668 --> 00:03:16.411]  This is a story and exclusive from Jerome Corsi here at Infowars.com.
[00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:20.994]  And he lays it out, asks the question, will this be the final nail in the coffin for the
[00:03:21.434 --> 00:03:24.277]  So-called Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.
[00:03:24.297 --> 00:03:35.909]  He said, federal court litigation provides evidence that the Obama administration illegally diverted taxpayer funds that had not been appropriated by Congress in an unconstitutional scheme to keep Obamacare from imploding.
[00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.235]  Now this all goes back to a decision by a judge back in May of 2016, May of last year.
[00:03:43.237 --> 00:03:51.282]  In that court case, you had Congress saying you're not going to divert funds from one area of Obamacare to another area of Obamacare.
[00:03:51.302 --> 00:04:03.451]  And if you look at that court decision there, it says the court will grant a summary judgment to the House of Representatives and will also enjoin any further reimbursements under Section 1402 until a valid appropriation is in place.
[00:04:03.891 --> 00:04:12.377]  Now, Section 1402 was the way that Obama was going to fund in Obamacare those who needed a subsidy for the ACA.
[00:04:13.337 --> 00:04:19.560]  Not to be deterred, not to allow the law to get in the way, the grifter-in-chief came up with another solution.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.522]  And this is what Jerome Corsi has shown here in his research.
[00:04:24.802 --> 00:04:26.763]  After he was turned down by Judge Collier,
[00:04:27.862 --> 00:04:42.671]  And after she decided that Health and Human Services Secretary Burwell had no constitutional authority to divert funds that Congress appropriated to this section of the ACA to fund Obamacare subsidy payments to insurers under another section,
[00:04:43.311 --> 00:04:47.555]  They went to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.
[00:04:48.216 --> 00:04:54.642]  Forbidden by Judge Collier's decision from diverting money, Congress appropriated for other ACA provisions.
[00:04:55.083 --> 00:05:01.569]  The Obama administration faced the prospect that the government could not pay subsidies to permit lower income people to participate.
[00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:10.392]  In other words, it was dead in the water if Obama did not find another way to circumvent the court, to circumvent Congress.
[00:05:10.812 --> 00:05:11.552]  And so they did.
[00:05:11.572 --> 00:05:12.792]  And what did they do?
[00:05:13.652 --> 00:05:24.574]  They took what was supposed to be a 10% dividend from operating Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, they changed that into a 100% of the profits that they swept into Obamacare.
[00:05:24.834 --> 00:05:26.234]  Now going back to 2008, when the government took over
[00:05:29.315 --> 00:05:31.697]  Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae because they had gone bankrupt.
[00:05:31.757 --> 00:05:37.160]  They decided at the time that in exchange for preferred stock they were going to get a 10% dividend.
[00:05:37.581 --> 00:05:45.606]  Gradually that would pay back the money that they had used to bail out these two organizations and then that would turn over back to the taxpayers.
[00:05:45.666 --> 00:05:56.433]  But instead what Obama did was they decided to change the terms of this agreement and to sweep all the profits of Fannie and Freddie into the general fund.
[00:05:56.493 --> 00:05:57.174]  It was those
[00:05:58.015 --> 00:06:04.264]  Uh, profits that they then use to divert to Obamacare to keep it alive a little while longer.
[00:06:04.705 --> 00:06:12.036]  So there you go, that's how the grifter-in-chief operates and it underscores the fact that we cannot maintain Obamacare.
[00:06:12.376 --> 00:06:13.338]  It just can't be maintained.
[00:06:13.818 --> 00:06:23.062]  It must be repealed and it should be replaced with market factors as we saw outlined in Trump's campaign promises as he was running for president.
[00:06:23.082 --> 00:06:28.045]  We'll see what that exact plan is going to be within the next couple of weeks Donald Trump is going to unveil it.
[00:06:28.445 --> 00:06:36.669]  And we're going to talk about what Trump is going to talk about tomorrow as he has for the first time as he addresses the joint session of Congress.
[00:06:37.568 --> 00:06:47.272]  We're going to look at what he has proposed and made public today, but of course we're going to also see that Trump is really between a rock and a hard place.
[00:06:47.312 --> 00:06:50.854]  A good example of that is an article that was on Infowars today from Michael Snyder.
[00:06:51.534 --> 00:06:54.956]  And he looks at, this is really two different sections of this article.
[00:06:54.976 --> 00:06:59.358]  The first one is to look at how these bricks and mortar companies are closing rapidly.
[00:06:59.378 --> 00:07:04.040]  We've got JCPenney and Family Christian Stores, and Family Christian Stores is one of the largest
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.001]  Actually, the largest Christian-themed merchandiser.
[00:07:08.041 --> 00:07:10.162]  They've been in business for 85 years.
[00:07:10.182 --> 00:07:12.864]  They've got 3,000 people, 240 stores, 36 states.
[00:07:12.924 --> 00:07:14.244]  They have gone bankrupt.
[00:07:14.304 --> 00:07:16.605]  But JCPenney is headed down the same path.
[00:07:17.245 --> 00:07:19.006]  But our government is bankrupt.
[00:07:19.466 --> 00:07:24.368]  And this is something that David Stockman talked about in a recent interview.
[00:07:24.448 --> 00:07:26.309]  He was interviewed about what's coming up.
[00:07:26.349 --> 00:07:29.590]  He said, this is all going to hit the fan on March 17th.
[00:07:30.911 --> 00:07:40.862]  Now he wrote a book called Trumped and he predicted a Trump victory back in September of 2016 when few people outside of Infowars really thought he could pull it off.
[00:07:41.183 --> 00:07:44.466]  We were pretty confident that he could, actually not 100% confident.
[00:07:44.506 --> 00:07:47.109]  I think he was even more confident than we were that Trump would win.
[00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:49.933]  We figured that they would rig the election in one way or the other.
[00:07:50.613 --> 00:07:55.058]  But he started talking about the stock rally that came in the aftermath of Trump's election.
[00:07:55.078 --> 00:08:04.388]  Of course there was a lot of optimism that we had a president who was going to reduce taxes, reduce regulation, reduce the heavy hand of government that had been on Main Street.
[00:08:05.289 --> 00:08:07.651]  And now we have seen a massive Wall Street rally.
[00:08:07.691 --> 00:08:10.454]  He calls it the greatest sucker rally of all time.
[00:08:10.494 --> 00:08:12.556]  He said it's based on pure popium.
[00:08:13.317 --> 00:08:17.643]  And it's not only analysis at all of what it'll take to push through a big tax cut.
[00:08:18.264 --> 00:08:19.666]  He said Donald Trump is in a trap.
[00:08:19.806 --> 00:08:21.348]  And here's the dangerous thing right now.
[00:08:21.428 --> 00:08:23.431]  The total debt today is $20 trillion.
[00:08:23.471 --> 00:08:25.213]  And it's 106% of the gross domestic product.
[00:08:28.698 --> 00:08:32.260]  Of course, David Stockman was head of the Office of Management and Budget under Ronald Reagan.
[00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:36.943]  He put that plan together and he talked about how they had a lot more, way more wiggle room there.
[00:08:37.003 --> 00:08:43.226]  We have now 106% of the gross domestic product is now our accumulative debt.
[00:08:43.386 --> 00:08:46.288]  That's the accumulation of all the annual deficits.
[00:08:46.388 --> 00:08:51.311]  He said Trump is inheriting a built-in deficit of $10 trillion more.
[00:08:51.331 --> 00:08:57.134]  In other words, another 50% increase over the next decade under current policies that are built in.
[00:08:57.734 --> 00:08:58.815]  And what is that, essentially?
[00:08:59.235 --> 00:09:01.476]  Well, that is the welfare warfare state.
[00:09:02.337 --> 00:09:09.721]  So we have a situation here where we're going to have to get serious about cutting both of those to really have a dent on what's going on.
[00:09:09.761 --> 00:09:10.801]  We'll talk more about that.
[00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:13.643]  But he said what I think people are missing is the date.
[00:09:13.743 --> 00:09:15.184]  March 15th, 2017.
[00:09:15.684 --> 00:09:22.147]  That's the day that this debt ceiling holiday that Obama and Boehner put together right before the last election of October 2015.
[00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:23.128]  He said by summer
[00:09:25.169 --> 00:09:25.409]  I think so.
[00:09:40.936 --> 00:09:45.119]  By the establishment Democrat and Republican into this massive debt.
[00:09:45.419 --> 00:09:50.382]  And we also have in the same time frame the Federal Reserve is going to be raising interest rates.
[00:09:50.462 --> 00:10:03.550]  And we've already seen a spike in the number of mortgage defaults because a lot of people have their interest rates, their mortgages tied to interest rates that have already gone up a quarter of a percent after being held down for a very long time by the Federal Reserve.
[00:10:03.991 --> 00:10:06.372]  Now what is Trump planning to do tomorrow?
[00:10:06.392 --> 00:10:08.173]  Well he's given us some indications already.
[00:10:08.233 --> 00:10:09.214]  He met with governors today.
[00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:11.716]  And he told them, you're going to get some authority back.
[00:10:12.337 --> 00:10:24.849]  And I think it's interesting because I've heard Mike Huckabee say, for example, that many times he and other governors have gone to the federal government, went to Obama and said, give us less in terms of federal grants.
[00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:28.153]  Give us less money, but give us more freedom about how we're going to spend it.
[00:10:28.553 --> 00:10:31.915]  Well, Trump said to the governors, you're going to get your authority back, you're going to get your freedom back.
[00:10:31.955 --> 00:10:38.778]  He's indicating that he's going to give them grants to do various things, whether that's going to be health care issues or whether it's going to be infrastructure.
[00:10:38.798 --> 00:10:42.780]  I hope that's the way that this would go with infrastructure rather than
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:55.302]  Setting up sweetheart deals for crony capitalist foreign multinational corporations like we've seen done so much lately with toll roads being set up with foreign multinational corporations.
[00:10:55.722 --> 00:11:00.943]  President Trump told the nation's governors today at the White House that they will have more authority under his administration.
[00:11:01.243 --> 00:11:07.064]  He said, whatever we can, we will do to restore authority to the states when that is the appropriate thing to do.
[00:11:07.504 --> 00:11:11.105]  We're aiming to give you back a lot of the powers that have been taken away.
[00:11:11.325 --> 00:11:12.405]  Well, let's hope that that happens.
[00:11:13.485 --> 00:11:21.131]  We have Nancy Pelosi pushing back against Donald Trump, saying that he hasn't introduced a single job creation bill.
[00:11:21.772 --> 00:11:23.834]  Well, there's a couple of reasons for that.
[00:11:23.874 --> 00:11:29.959]  Number one, it's not the President's job to introduce bills, and Nancy Pelosi should know that it's the Congress's job to introduce bills.
[00:11:30.699 --> 00:11:36.264]  But also that the Democrats, especially Pelosi, have been doing everything they can to delay Donald Trump.
[00:11:36.304 --> 00:11:38.686]  And then the other thing is that the government doesn't create jobs.
[00:11:39.346 --> 00:11:41.047]  The government gets out of the way.
[00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:46.970]  The types of things that Nancy Pelosi and others do, calling it job creation, is actually job destroying.
[00:11:47.391 --> 00:11:53.934]  The regulations, the taxes, the mandates that they put on people makes it more difficult for them to hire or to maintain their workforce.
[00:11:54.034 --> 00:11:58.577]  So Trump understands that that's what is necessary is to get government out of the way.
[00:11:58.637 --> 00:12:00.338]  That's why there's been so much optimism
[00:12:00.718 --> 00:12:04.921]  Excessive optimism, as Greenspan would say, irrational exuberance.
[00:12:05.761 --> 00:12:07.923]  That's why the stock market is so vulnerable.
[00:12:07.943 --> 00:12:09.964]  That's why we're so vulnerable in so many different ways.
[00:12:10.405 --> 00:12:11.966]  Federal Reserve can raise interest rates.
[00:12:12.626 --> 00:12:16.809]  Boehner and Obama put together a debt moratorium that's about to release.
[00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:21.332]  And then we also have the stock market, which could pop at any moment.
[00:12:21.472 --> 00:12:25.455]  All of that could affect real people, not just the Wall Street financiers.
[00:12:26.175 --> 00:12:27.896]  Now, what did Donald Trump say today?
[00:12:27.936 --> 00:12:30.238]  Well, he said he's going to increase defense spending.
[00:12:31.414 --> 00:12:39.517]  Ten percent, a ten percent spike in defense spending, but he's going to match this with massive cuts to other agencies.
[00:12:39.597 --> 00:12:47.781]  The Washington Post said that the increases in defense-related spending by about $54 billion while cutting other federal agencies by the same amount
[00:12:48.761 --> 00:12:52.984]  And they quote Trump as saying, we're going to make it easier for states to invest in infrastructure, just like I just said.
[00:12:53.024 --> 00:12:59.129]  We're going to spend, we spent six trillion dollars in the Middle East, and we have potholes all over our highways and our roads.
[00:12:59.149 --> 00:13:03.812]  It's almost as if we let the terrorists bomb us, but we let that happen to ourselves.
[00:13:03.892 --> 00:13:06.735]  It's years and years of neglect here at home.
[00:13:06.815 --> 00:13:09.517]  Infrastructure, he said, we're going to start spending on infrastructure big.
[00:13:10.337 --> 00:13:18.481]  And they point out in the Washington Post, Republicans in Congress expect the details to be released this week will be the first elements of a broader budget that will be rolled out next month.
[00:13:18.921 --> 00:13:28.566]  The Trump administration is expected to release a pared down skinny budget the week of March the 13th and a fuller list of budget requirements by the end of March or early April.
[00:13:28.626 --> 00:13:35.430]  So we're going to see a lot of details coming up in the next two to four weeks, not only about the budget, but about Obamacare.
[00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:37.771]  We may see something about tax cuts as well.
[00:13:38.834 --> 00:13:40.015]  How do we roll all that together?
[00:13:40.655 --> 00:13:44.639]  Well, Ron Paul says on military and spending, it's Trump versus Trump.
[00:13:44.919 --> 00:13:52.825]  And he quotes him and what he said about the six trillion dollars that we spent abroad, how that has left us in worse shape than we ever were here in this country.
[00:13:53.346 --> 00:13:54.667]  And he said it would be better.
[00:13:54.707 --> 00:13:57.129]  And this is his speech at CPAC last week.
[00:13:57.509 --> 00:13:58.710]  He said it would have been better for U.S.
[00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:04.555]  presidents to have spent the last 15 years at the beach than to have pursued its Middle East war policy, stating that the U.S.
[00:14:04.615 --> 00:14:09.099]  infrastructure could have been rebuilt several times over with the money wasted on such militarism.
[00:14:09.659 --> 00:14:13.422]  And yet, he's going to increase defense spending here at home.
[00:14:14.183 --> 00:14:19.847]  And he asked, how many times do we have to be able to blow the world up over and over again?
[00:14:20.428 --> 00:14:21.469]  See, here's the big problem.
[00:14:22.421 --> 00:14:28.406]  With the welfare-warfare state, it's really kind of, even on the immigration issue, it's kind of like a push-pull.
[00:14:29.367 --> 00:14:36.293]  With the warfare state, we push people into the United States because we bomb their countries and then we say, well, we've got to bring the refugees here.
[00:14:36.333 --> 00:14:44.600]  That's what the left, what the establishment is doing to us, the left and right, saying we've got to bring the people here that we have made homeless, that we have destroyed in their country.
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.422]  So that's the pushing people into our country.
[00:14:47.983 --> 00:14:50.164]  The pull is the welfare state.
[00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:54.031]  With a welfare state, we offer them all kinds of benefits.
[00:14:54.331 --> 00:14:56.732]  As a magnet, we pull them into our country.
[00:14:56.792 --> 00:15:02.773]  So if you want to do something about immigration, perhaps we should stop pushing and pulling people into this country.
[00:15:04.034 --> 00:15:08.595]  Nevertheless, as they're talking about this, they're saying Steve Mnuchin says he's not going to touch entitlement programs.
[00:15:08.995 --> 00:15:10.255]  He's not going to touch Social Security.
[00:15:10.615 --> 00:15:11.696]  He's not going to touch Medicare.
[00:15:11.716 --> 00:15:16.437]  So they're going to increase defense spending, but they're not going to touch entitlement spending.
[00:15:17.318 --> 00:15:22.360]  In a sense, as an introductory move, this does make sense to some degree.
[00:15:23.321 --> 00:15:41.329]  Because when we look at what has to eventually happen, yes, you do eventually have to get to those, but their first cuts, they're saying this is going to be revenue neutral, the $54 billion, the 10% that they're going to add to the Pentagon spending, they say they're going to take not out of entitlement spendings, but they're going to take it out of the administrative state.
[00:15:42.369 --> 00:15:44.570]  And this is something else that was said at CPAC last week.
[00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:56.733]  We had Stephen Bannon saying that they were going to try to get rid of the administrative state that has been the source of so much problems in America.
[00:15:57.054 --> 00:16:05.996]  And that is the massive, entrenched bureaucracy that taxes us, that creates law for us, without us ever having a say about this.
[00:16:06.036 --> 00:16:07.057]  We can never remove them.
[00:16:07.557 --> 00:16:08.337]  We didn't elect them.
[00:16:08.917 --> 00:16:11.018]  We had Congress abdicate its authority to them.
[00:16:11.818 --> 00:16:20.224]  And Bannon, I think wisely, is moving to cut them down at the same time they transfer money from their budgets to the defense budget.
[00:16:21.738 --> 00:16:24.860]  To some degree, that is a legitimate function of government.
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:34.087]  The welfare state, the EPA, and even the State Department really aren't that necessary to our well-being, although they put themselves out there as such.
[00:16:34.428 --> 00:16:43.154]  New American points out that these entitlement programs will not be touched, and when Mnuchin talks about it, he talks about it right back to the Laffer Curve.
[00:16:43.515 --> 00:16:44.716]  He says, we're going to cut
[00:16:45.779 --> 00:16:49.864]  We're going to get more revenue as we cut taxes, as we cut regulation.
[00:16:50.385 --> 00:16:51.767]  Now that certainly is true.
[00:16:51.827 --> 00:16:56.253]  We know that is true from a common sense standpoint.
[00:16:56.453 --> 00:16:59.458]  The question is will we get enough there to make up for that deficit?
[00:17:00.058 --> 00:17:02.221]  We did get more tax revenue when Ronald Reagan
[00:17:02.762 --> 00:17:07.887]  Cut taxes and cut regulation, but we didn't get enough to make up for the increases in spending.
[00:17:07.967 --> 00:17:10.930]  That's the thing we always have to watch out for.
[00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:14.774]  Now The Hill points out that Trump's budget won't touch these entitlements.
[00:17:14.814 --> 00:17:23.903]  They say that his aides have promised not only to not touch the entitlements, but also pay down some of this 20 trillion dollar national debt.
[00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:32.719]  They say that for this to happen, they are expecting to see a 4% to 6% growth of gross domestic product.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:37.304]  Now we have seen only 1.6% growth under Obama.
[00:17:37.684 --> 00:17:43.551]  It's not going to be hard to beat the Obama administration's growth projections because they didn't do anything to try to grow the economy.
[00:17:44.091 --> 00:17:47.754]  We've already seen Donald Trump, even before he became president, bringing jobs back.
[00:17:48.175 --> 00:17:52.058]  One of the places, though, that they're eventually going to have to go to is to Social Security.
[00:17:52.518 --> 00:18:01.286]  Will they cut the Social Security payments to people who have been promised this all their life, who have paid into Social Security all their working life, or will they perhaps
[00:18:01.866 --> 00:18:07.467]  Cut some of the billions of dollars that are going to foreign citizens who come here to live off of our system.
[00:18:07.487 --> 00:18:08.408]  You don't think that's happening?
[00:18:08.668 --> 00:18:09.848]  Look at this article from Breitbart.
[00:18:09.888 --> 00:18:15.770]  Social Security Administration paid $1 billion in benefits to those without a social security number.
[00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:22.711]  And they point out, the Inspector General says, illegal aliens can receive benefits through the representative payee system.
[00:18:22.751 --> 00:18:24.772]  That means that they can have minors come here,
[00:18:25.572 --> 00:18:29.994]  And then the adults that are attached to them can come here and get welfare payments.
[00:18:30.535 --> 00:18:39.300]  They say representative payees play a significant role in many beneficiaries' lives, said the Social Security Agency, because they're reluctant to give these people up.
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:44.402]  They say the absence of a Social Security number is not a criterion preventing an individual from serving as a payee.
[00:18:45.063 --> 00:18:54.248]  So you're going to cut people who have worked in America and paid taxes all their lives so that you can pay for foreign citizens to come here and collect welfare benefits that aren't related to retirement?
[00:18:55.424 --> 00:18:56.364]  That's what we have to look at.
[00:18:56.404 --> 00:18:57.604]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:19:01.165 --> 00:19:03.406]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[00:19:03.706 --> 00:19:15.728]  The missing link of why our ancestors, whether you were in Africa or ancient Albion, which is England today, why our ancestors were so much stronger.
[00:19:15.748 --> 00:19:23.290]  I mean, there are huge archaeological reports, all sorts of anthropology studies, you can look them up for yourself, that show
[00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:32.436]  That humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[00:19:32.576 --> 00:19:38.740]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.462]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[00:19:42.462 --> 00:19:43.703]  People are falling apart.
[00:19:43.723 --> 00:19:44.724]  They're totally depressed.
[00:19:44.744 --> 00:19:45.284]  They're not happy.
[00:19:45.865 --> 00:19:46.845]  What is going on?
[00:19:48.126 --> 00:19:51.969]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[00:19:53.206 --> 00:19:55.727]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[00:19:56.167 --> 00:19:57.868]  Today we call it bone broth.
[00:19:58.068 --> 00:20:05.072]  And for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:20:05.312 --> 00:20:13.616]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWars Life products.
[00:20:15.035 --> 00:20:21.547]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[00:20:21.928 --> 00:20:25.354]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:20:25.394 --> 00:20:26.456]  You used the skin.
[00:20:27.062 --> 00:20:34.207]  To cover yourself up for shelter, you use the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you use the bones for strength.
[00:20:34.727 --> 00:20:48.577]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[00:20:48.697 --> 00:20:50.158]  The bone is so amazing.
[00:20:50.578 --> 00:20:56.162]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[00:20:57.298 --> 00:21:00.200]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[00:21:00.741 --> 00:21:06.185]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:15.952]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[00:21:16.212 --> 00:21:20.756]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[00:21:20.996 --> 00:21:22.797]  This is a absolute win-win.
[00:21:22.857 --> 00:21:25.618]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
[00:21:25.918 --> 00:21:32.020]  You support InfoWars and all we're doing to promote freedom and the restoration of our Republic and promotion of freedom worldwide.
[00:21:33.321 --> 00:21:42.044]  The journey towards better health and giving our bodies these amazing compounds that God created starts at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:21:42.224 --> 00:21:46.606]  Three years in the making, incredible research and the very best ingredients.
[00:21:47.126 --> 00:21:49.727]  I'm Alex Jones and I may not be a caveman,
[00:21:50.569 --> 00:21:53.739]  Compared to these trendies out there in the street, I'm as close as it gets.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.571]  Join me at InformersLife.com and get your caveman formula today.
[00:22:01.018 --> 00:22:04.381]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:06.743]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:22:06.923 --> 00:22:15.310]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.913]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:22:19.073 --> 00:22:28.080]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:36.962]  Supermale vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:22:37.162 --> 00:22:39.083]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:22:39.403 --> 00:22:46.985]  Supermale vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:53.530]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:22:53.830 --> 00:23:00.755]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Mel Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:07.100]  I think.
[00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:24.431]  He's not going to be focusing on mothers, for example.
[00:23:24.451 --> 00:23:35.875]  He's going to be focusing on gang members, and there's ample evidence of how gang members, especially in these sanctuary cities, are being released even though they have committed serious crimes, being released back into the community.
[00:23:35.935 --> 00:23:41.017]  Nobody is going to be upset about gang members being deported, and the gang members in Washington
[00:23:41.738 --> 00:23:43.180]  Who are destroying this country.
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.682]  People like the EPA.
[00:23:44.742 --> 00:23:46.204]  People like the State Department.
[00:23:46.704 --> 00:23:47.686]  Many other agencies.
[00:23:47.866 --> 00:23:52.051]  That's the source of the new increase in defense spending.
[00:23:52.071 --> 00:23:54.575]  So I think on that level, it is pure genius.
[00:23:54.895 --> 00:23:58.380]  It's a way to increase the Defense Department, which they would like to do.
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:03.626]  Whether I agree with that or not, they can at least eviscerate the swamp.
[00:24:03.987 --> 00:24:06.550]  So now, where are they going to be taking this money from?
[00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:13.439]  Well, they said there's going to be massive cuts to the EPA climate change programs to help fund these drastic increases in military spending.
[00:24:13.479 --> 00:24:14.881]  This is the Hill talking about this.
[00:24:15.402 --> 00:24:15.762]  And good!
[00:24:16.403 --> 00:24:16.603]  Good.
[00:24:16.643 --> 00:24:17.624]  Let's eviscerate that.
[00:24:17.664 --> 00:24:22.488]  Let's eviscerate the people who are trying to push this phony climate change agenda on us.
[00:24:22.928 --> 00:24:27.251]  But also, The Guardian says, oh, it could come out of the State Department as well.
[00:24:27.311 --> 00:24:28.372]  We wouldn't want that to happen.
[00:24:28.392 --> 00:24:34.917]  They say this is aggressive emphasis on defense firepower might come at the expense of diplomacy.
[00:24:35.578 --> 00:24:39.181]  Well, let's just remind people that they call the State Department foggy bottom.
[00:24:39.921 --> 00:24:41.862]  Because it's kind of the center of the swamp.
[00:24:42.482 --> 00:24:47.605]  They say that a second official said the State Department's budget could be cut by as much as 30 percent.
[00:24:47.625 --> 00:24:48.185]  Let's hope so.
[00:24:48.886 --> 00:24:53.288]  Which would force a major restructuring and the elimination of some programs.
[00:24:54.029 --> 00:24:55.469]  Things that I'm sure we don't need.
[00:24:55.529 --> 00:25:00.972]  Things that are actually probably very detrimental to what the United States needs in terms of defense.
[00:25:00.992 --> 00:25:03.073]  Let's hope that they cut the Department of Education as well.
[00:25:03.574 --> 00:25:07.096]  Let's cut them to the bone if we can't eliminate them entirely.
[00:25:07.836 --> 00:25:14.140]  Now moving on, we see that the Pope is now staking out copyright to his image.
[00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:20.824]  And I think this is kind of interesting because it shows what a globalist mindset this Pope has.
[00:25:20.924 --> 00:25:30.209]  For example, they're saying the proliferation of papal-themed t-shirts, snow globes, tea towels around the world, the Vatican wants to get in on all of that money.
[00:25:30.269 --> 00:25:31.590]  That's one aspect of it.
[00:25:32.435 --> 00:25:36.337]  But just as we saw with these trade agreements, there were two parts of it.
[00:25:37.017 --> 00:25:42.240]  One of them was, hey, we don't want people taking our copyrighted merchandise and reproducing it in China.
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.501]  That's a valid concern.
[00:25:43.641 --> 00:25:48.744]  But they also wanted to exercise copyright issues as a way of censorship.
[00:25:48.784 --> 00:25:52.986]  And I think both of those things are probably present here with this particular pope.
[00:25:53.446 --> 00:26:03.121]  They say that the Vatican's Secretary of State will undertake a systematic surveillance that is aimed at monitoring the way the image of the Holy Father is used.
[00:26:03.221 --> 00:26:08.308]  They say the Vatican has hired a global law firm to protect its intellectual property rights.
[00:26:09.264 --> 00:26:10.685]  This is a big change, folks.
[00:26:11.285 --> 00:26:15.007]  This is not something that the Pope has ever done in 2,000 years, they say.
[00:26:15.607 --> 00:26:23.011]  They've seen Popes venerated in all kinds of merchandise, flags, banners, and other things, but they have never tried to profit off of it.
[00:26:23.031 --> 00:26:33.356]  They said the Pope's image rights are no different than those of any other famous celebrity, so it's not surprising that the Vatican is giving notice that it will protect its intellectual property rights as necessary, said
[00:26:34.136 --> 00:26:37.159]  A lawyer that deals with international property rights.
[00:26:37.239 --> 00:26:43.505]  And understand, that is the basis for which these globalist trade agreements were being sold.
[00:26:43.525 --> 00:26:44.686]  That was a big part of it.
[00:26:45.146 --> 00:26:53.273]  So it comes as really no surprise that the guy who has been promoting global governance, who has been promoting climate change, is pushing this.
[00:26:53.353 --> 00:26:55.716]  Maybe he can become the sponsor of the Weather Channel.
[00:26:56.276 --> 00:26:58.498]  The Weather Channel, brought to you by the Vatican.
[00:27:00.197 --> 00:27:07.360]  Of course, ignore the fact that the Weather Channel founder said that there's absolutely no scientific basis for climate change.
[00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:10.902]  He said, look, we don't have that many measurements to base this on.
[00:27:10.922 --> 00:27:15.704]  You're going to tell people that the world is going to melt down if there's a one degree change in temperature?
[00:27:15.724 --> 00:27:20.426]  He said, we don't have that kind of accuracy, and we didn't have that many thermometers in place.
[00:27:20.446 --> 00:27:21.787]  And that was just in his lifetime.
[00:27:22.472 --> 00:27:27.075]  But of course, maybe he can get some sponsorships with Wheaties or with McDonald's or something.
[00:27:27.095 --> 00:27:28.575]  You want fries with that indulgence?
[00:27:29.236 --> 00:27:36.760]  Another example of the contempt that the elite have for us is a Japanese robotics manufacturer, SoftBank.
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:46.305]  The founder's been going around, made a lot of news today, talking about how super smart robots are going to outnumber humans by, he says, there's going to be four billion.
[00:27:46.526 --> 00:27:50.148]  They're going to outnumber humans by four billion within just three decades.
[00:27:50.168 --> 00:27:50.668]  Well, you know what?
[00:27:51.434 --> 00:28:03.057]  We're outnumbered by ants right now, we're outnumbered by cockroaches, and I think we're going to have to come up with some kind of a pesticide to rid us of this pest of artificial intelligence.
[00:28:03.077 --> 00:28:06.878]  You have to understand, they're not just coming after our manufacturing jobs.
[00:28:07.918 --> 00:28:11.719]  They are going to be coming after the jobs of the military and the police.
[00:28:11.739 --> 00:28:15.260]  Do you really want to live in a world where the military and the police are controlled?
[00:28:16.147 --> 00:28:16.507]  Bye bye.
[00:28:33.476 --> 00:28:35.097]  Expressing their contempt for us.
[00:28:35.137 --> 00:28:40.801]  Just as we saw Elon Musk saying, you're going to join with us, you're going to join with the cyborgs, or you're going to become irrelevant.
[00:28:40.821 --> 00:28:42.502]  This guy says, well, we're going to outnumber you.
[00:28:42.942 --> 00:28:47.465]  And then he goes on to say, in 30 years, your shoes will be smarter than you.
[00:28:48.165 --> 00:28:51.348]  Yes, but my shoes have a soul and you don't.
[00:28:52.188 --> 00:28:55.971]  He said, one of the chips in our shoes in the next 30 years will be smarter than your brain.
[00:28:56.431 --> 00:28:58.313]  We will be less than our shoes.
[00:28:58.793 --> 00:29:01.335]  And we were stepping on them, he chuckled.
[00:29:01.435 --> 00:29:03.997]  So I guess they think that they're going to step on you.
[00:29:04.597 --> 00:29:07.579]  They are stepping on our freedoms, especially at the airport.
[00:29:07.619 --> 00:29:11.722]  We saw this story from Zero Hedge that was on Drudge earlier today.
[00:29:12.443 --> 00:29:13.163]  Welcome aboard.
[00:29:13.744 --> 00:29:14.764]  But first, the U.S.
[00:29:14.824 --> 00:29:16.866]  Marshals will give you a retina scan.
[00:29:17.446 --> 00:29:20.609]  I want you to think about how dangerous this is.
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:25.523]  Not only is it an Orwellian situation that this guy describes.
[00:29:25.664 --> 00:29:30.949]  They've already given their tickets, they're walking down the jet bridge, and now there's another checkpoint that they've got to go through.
[00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:35.233]  Understand the TSA is not simply about airports either.
[00:29:35.413 --> 00:29:36.374]  This is the travel
[00:29:37.529 --> 00:29:38.009]  Authority.
[00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:39.470]  Travel Security Authority.
[00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:40.611]  We're not getting any security.
[00:29:41.191 --> 00:29:44.453]  They're doing things, as I point out here, they walk down this runway.
[00:29:44.473 --> 00:29:49.896]  This is dystopian style and they're writing, this is from Zero Hedge, a dystopian style black regalia.
[00:29:49.936 --> 00:29:55.259]  These two guys, heavily armed, stood next to an upright machine with a glowing green eye.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:58.981]  Every passenger, one by one, was told to step on a mat, look into the green scanner.
[00:29:59.061 --> 00:30:04.925]  It was scanning our eyes and matching that scan with our passport, which was also scanned, yet again.
[00:30:06.718 --> 00:30:07.278]  Think about that.
[00:30:07.638 --> 00:30:11.460]  Think about that Orwellian, dystopian, science fiction image.
[00:30:12.641 --> 00:30:15.182]  And that is what's coming to all of your travel.
[00:30:15.242 --> 00:30:22.465]  Not just when you're traveling on airplanes, but when you're going to be moving around in the city on foot, when you get into the cars that they own, that they tax and track your every movement with.
[00:30:23.286 --> 00:30:34.231]  This is incredibly dangerous, folks, because what they are doing at this point is using the threat and intimidation of confiscating your ticket that you've already paid a couple hundred dollars for, made your plans to go somewhere,
[00:30:35.407 --> 00:30:39.190]  Probably have your hotel room, your car rental, all that stuff is just going to be flushed.
[00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:49.157]  All that money is going to go away, all your vacation time is going to go away unless you submit to them, unless you give them your biometric information to be put into their database.
[00:30:50.078 --> 00:30:54.621]  That is how insidious this is and how much they are pushing this.
[00:30:54.721 --> 00:30:56.983]  But meanwhile in Germany we see that they get it.
[00:30:57.711 --> 00:31:04.475]  They understand that there is some value to privacy at least at some level, more so than we do here in America.
[00:31:04.716 --> 00:31:07.257]  Have you seen many stories about this?
[00:31:07.337 --> 00:31:11.880]  No, we just have this one story and Drudge picked it up and everybody else is just kind of ignoring this.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:12.581]  But in Germany,
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.482]  They have a doll called My Friend Kayla.
[00:31:15.502 --> 00:31:36.802]  Of course, it's an American doll, and the Americans thought it would be a great idea to listen to children's voices, to send the recording to their website, to transcribe it with the Massachusetts-based Nuance Communication, translate it into text, then use that to generate an appropriate response, which is sent back to the doll, which then speaks it.
[00:31:37.659 --> 00:31:39.543]  And they said, well, that's really kind of cute.
[00:31:40.245 --> 00:31:42.791]  But understand that you're violating people's property.
[00:31:43.091 --> 00:31:44.535]  This is what the German government said.
[00:31:45.467 --> 00:31:56.274]  I said items that conceal cameras or microphones and that are capable of transmitting a signal and therefore can transmit data without detection compromise people's privacy.
[00:31:56.434 --> 00:32:02.058]  Yes, let's not forget that at the very bottom of this they are destroying your property.
[00:32:02.298 --> 00:32:05.920]  They're eavesdropping on your life and they are cataloging this information.
[00:32:06.641 --> 00:32:07.401]  Make no doubt about it.
[00:32:07.441 --> 00:32:08.182]  It isn't so much
[00:32:09.096 --> 00:32:11.478]  What you say or what you write as what you do.
[00:32:11.538 --> 00:32:13.860]  They're watching everything that you say and do.
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:15.181]  Who you interact with.
[00:32:15.861 --> 00:32:17.102]  That's the key aspect here.
[00:32:17.482 --> 00:32:20.125]  They say this applies in particular to children's toys.
[00:32:20.185 --> 00:32:21.746]  And so they banned it in Germany.
[00:32:21.966 --> 00:32:25.148]  This is a guy who's president of Germany's telecommunications regulator.
[00:32:25.769 --> 00:32:26.990]  I'm glad they understand that.
[00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:30.132]  We seem to be pretty clueless about this type of thing in America.
[00:32:30.553 --> 00:32:36.117]  And if we see something like this, most Americans would look at this and say, wow, isn't that interesting?
[00:32:36.835 --> 00:32:41.298]  My child can talk to the doll, and the doll can talk back and respond to it.
[00:32:41.838 --> 00:32:46.361]  And we don't think about how our information is being cataloged, being captured.
[00:32:46.861 --> 00:32:54.106]  How, like fools, we're walking with our eyes wide open, just like these people at the airport, wide open into tyranny.
[00:32:54.466 --> 00:32:55.807]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:33:06.508 --> 00:33:16.037]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:33:17.022 --> 00:33:18.903]  That's why I get questions all the time over the years.
[00:33:18.923 --> 00:33:23.025]  Why don't you sell body armor at infowarestore.com?
[00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:25.726]  Or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:26.746]  And it's simple.
[00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:32.429]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:33.930]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.791]  There's quality versus price.
[00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:38.732]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:33:39.332 --> 00:33:44.775]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor,
[00:33:45.595 --> 00:33:52.304]  has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people.
[00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:55.913]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:33:56.653 --> 00:34:03.715]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:34:04.415 --> 00:34:07.216]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:09.657]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:13.678]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:14.919]  Well, believe me,
[00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:18.677]  This is Disruptive to Tyrants Worldwide.
[00:34:19.297 --> 00:34:30.319]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:31.959]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:34.099]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.761]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:34:42.541 --> 00:34:44.882]  We've, uh, went out and did some testing.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:47.663]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:34:47.683 --> 00:34:54.166]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, um, could be so strong.
[00:34:54.386 --> 00:35:07.672]  So what we did is we went out, we used, um, different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:35:08.052 --> 00:35:08.872]  Born in Texas.
[00:35:09.213 --> 00:35:10.173]  Made in America.
[00:35:10.373 --> 00:35:13.015]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:13.875]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:13.935 --> 00:35:14.875]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:35:15.236 --> 00:35:16.576]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:17.237]  It's waterproof.
[00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:17.737]  You can wear it.
[00:35:17.777 --> 00:35:18.337]  It's comfortable.
[00:35:18.397 --> 00:35:19.218]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:35:19.238 --> 00:35:21.539]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:29.623]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:35:30.323 --> 00:35:33.986]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:40.712]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:35:40.732 --> 00:35:42.094]  What did they really say about it?
[00:35:42.194 --> 00:35:43.214]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:46.177]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:54.865]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're weighing, they're wearing these big heavy bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:35:55.425 --> 00:36:00.429]  So, they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:07.954]  And 90, I mean, you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in a commission of crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:36:07.974 --> 00:36:09.636]  This stops that, unless it's a slug.
[00:36:09.656 --> 00:36:10.796]  I mean, that's amazing.
[00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:14.059]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[00:36:14.319 --> 00:36:20.183]  And soon, and we'll have it, if it's available to civilians, they're not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[00:36:20.504 --> 00:36:24.486]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:28.689]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:36:28.709 --> 00:36:29.469]  People didn't believe it.
[00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:30.810]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.611]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:36:33.932 --> 00:36:36.033]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:36:36.974 --> 00:36:41.156]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:48.356]  Again, fund the Info War, get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:36:48.836 --> 00:36:50.837]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:50.857 --> 00:36:50.837]  $200.
[00:36:51.458 --> 00:36:54.399]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:36:54.479 --> 00:36:55.180]  It's amazing.
[00:37:03.632 --> 00:37:11.480]  Well, it's not enough that President Trump has to deal with crazy communists in the streets, as well as a massively biased mainstream media.
[00:37:12.121 --> 00:37:18.328]  Donald Trump and his administration are also having to deal with their own employees, especially there in the State Department.
[00:37:18.688 --> 00:37:24.114]  Now, just in the last week alone, we have seen a memo, an anti-leak memo, mind you,
[00:37:24.534 --> 00:37:26.536]  Leaked out of the State Department, promptly.
[00:37:26.916 --> 00:37:32.941]  And then most recently, Sean Spicer was actually targeting his own communications staff in a leak crackdown.
[00:37:32.981 --> 00:37:34.142]  Now, Millie Weaver joins me.
[00:37:34.583 --> 00:37:36.965]  Talk to us a little bit about the dangers of this.
[00:37:37.025 --> 00:37:46.032]  I mean, the Trump administration is not able to trust the people with whom he is supposed to be, they're supposed to be working to keep the peaceful transition of power in place.
[00:37:46.052 --> 00:37:47.994]  Yeah, that's exactly what's happening.
[00:37:48.094 --> 00:37:50.756]  And it's absolutely horrifying to know that
[00:37:51.537 --> 00:37:53.978]  Leaks are happening at this fast pace.
[00:37:54.038 --> 00:38:04.283]  I mean, it puts the entire nation at risk when people are just leaking confidential information or leaking sensitive, you know, and that's just what we're seeing.
[00:38:05.463 --> 00:38:07.364]  Spencer actually had a meeting.
[00:38:07.404 --> 00:38:11.766]  He pulled everybody in from the press corps and told them about, you know,
[00:38:12.466 --> 00:38:16.789]  These leaks and the warnings of a security risk that this could create.
[00:38:16.829 --> 00:38:23.133]  He actually had everybody, you know, put their phones out and electronics out if you have nothing to hide and let us look through them.
[00:38:23.534 --> 00:38:26.116]  And I guess he looked through their devices and whatnot.
[00:38:26.456 --> 00:38:28.077]  And then that was leaked.
[00:38:29.058 --> 00:38:31.301]  It was immediately leaked out, the whole story.
[00:38:31.361 --> 00:38:43.014]  The reason why we even know about it right now is because it was leaked out that he did this and how can Trump even be expected to run a ship
[00:38:43.815 --> 00:38:48.180]  Probably, you know, as the president when he has mutiny going on.
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:48.461]  Right.
[00:38:48.581 --> 00:38:59.294]  I mean, if you were a soldier in the army and you leaked out photos or even just sent photos via text message of, oh, look, here's my bunk inside, you know, that right there would get you in a lot of trouble.
[00:38:59.634 --> 00:39:07.880]  But here we have people who are very high level speaking with sensitive information with the president and his staff who are leaking things out to the press.
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:13.104]  Of course, we see, you know, the Washington Post is the first one to typically receive this information.
[00:39:13.444 --> 00:39:19.409]  They're kind of the main channel for the CIA operatives there, those unnamed sources within the government.
[00:39:19.969 --> 00:39:22.731]  But we saw this even before Donald Trump was elected president.
[00:39:23.031 --> 00:39:24.713]  We saw Harry Reid was actually
[00:39:25.533 --> 00:39:38.326]  They're on camera just proudly announcing to the media that they were going to be feeding Trump, and he personally suggested that these intelligence agencies feed Donald Trump false information, inaccurate information.
[00:39:38.506 --> 00:39:43.050]  And so at the time, people were saying, well, he's never going to get elected president, so it doesn't matter anyway.
[00:39:43.371 --> 00:39:45.893]  Now that he is the president, we see the same type of
[00:39:46.934 --> 00:39:52.255]  Blocking of information or feeding falsities is there as well and this is dangerous.
[00:39:52.375 --> 00:39:53.596]  It's very dangerous.
[00:39:53.616 --> 00:40:06.699]  You know, there's a an ex CIA officer, a man named Brian Dean Wright, who actually came out in an interview with Tucker Carlson and was talking about how he has reason to believe that
[00:40:07.039 --> 00:40:07.239]  I think?
[00:40:26.107 --> 00:40:34.269]  Have a functioning government when you have like spies and people that are just going to be leaking information trying to undermine the president.
[00:40:34.329 --> 00:40:39.190]  And that is undermining the will of the American people as well, Leanne.
[00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:47.572]  Well, and they're also setting it up so that the American people are not going to have access to this information at present or in years to come when these things are declassified.
[00:40:48.012 --> 00:40:51.296]  Because now Trump's administration is dealing face-to-face.
[00:40:51.316 --> 00:40:55.601]  They're not allowing anyone to send text messages or emails because they don't want those to get leaked.
[00:40:55.982 --> 00:41:02.570]  So now we're actually getting to the point where it's creating an issue with not preserving this within the public record.
[00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:24.124]  Exactly and that might have been one of the reasons why when they looked through the phones of the press corps and their electronic devices they were not able to find anything and they're saying that it's because of apps such as Signal or Confide where they use encryption messaging and that's kind of a way for them to hide and share information without it being traced.
[00:41:24.324 --> 00:41:24.544]  Right.
[00:41:24.684 --> 00:41:26.505]  It'll immediately delete.
[00:41:26.565 --> 00:41:31.687]  But of course, I'm sure even with that, the NSA is able to get into that type of information.
[00:41:31.887 --> 00:41:32.128]  Yeah.
[00:41:32.168 --> 00:41:38.731]  But I mean, it's not enough that the White House is going to war with the media, but the fact that they're actually now fighting with their own employees.
[00:41:39.131 --> 00:41:46.714]  And it's not as if he can just completely drain the swamp and get rid of all of these useless government employees who are actively working to dismantle this country.
[00:41:46.774 --> 00:41:50.236]  But I mean, that just really goes to show you how important it is
[00:41:50.836 --> 00:42:10.008]  When you have sort of a changing of administrations, when you have these polar opposite, allegedly, and you know, left versus right polar opposite parties that transition power to see how people in the inner inner workings there could really have their mind set on maintaining the status quo of the previous administration.
[00:42:10.968 --> 00:42:16.432]  I mean, just quickly, did you see Hillary Clinton come out with a video saying, we must resist, resistance is so important?
[00:42:16.953 --> 00:42:29.662]  Well, we need to resist and that's why, you know, we're wearing these t-shirts where, you know, we need to show that we are in the fight and we are going to take this information war to them and that we are not going to stop.
[00:42:29.682 --> 00:42:35.346]  We're going to support Donald Trump, so make sure you support Donald Trump and get a shirt today, you know.
[00:42:35.366 --> 00:42:37.308]  Support InfoWars at the exact same time.
[00:42:37.328 --> 00:42:38.508]  You can get these at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:42:40.185 --> 00:42:41.666]  You see what's happening at the border.
[00:42:41.706 --> 00:42:49.389]  All of a sudden, for the first time, we're getting gang members out, we're getting drug lords out, we're getting really bad dudes out of this country.
[00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:52.951]  And at a rate that nobody's ever seen before.
[00:42:53.631 --> 00:42:54.572]  And they're the bad ones.
[00:42:55.772 --> 00:43:07.058]  And it's a military operation because what has been allowed to come into our country, when you see gang violence that you've read about like never before and all of the things, much of that is people that are here illegally.
[00:43:08.294 --> 00:43:10.757]  And they're rough and they're tough, but they're not tough like our people.
[00:43:11.238 --> 00:43:17.986]  President Donald Trump's campaign promise to secure the long overdue United States border is underway.
[00:43:23.473 --> 00:43:28.680]  Two strong sovereign countries from time to time will have differences.
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:35.769]  What happens in Mexico also affects the security of the United States, and what happens in the United States affects the security of Mexico.
[00:43:35.789 --> 00:43:37.211]  Together our countries jointly manage
[00:43:41.331 --> 00:43:42.232]  We're good to go.
[00:43:58.786 --> 00:44:04.712]  Those proceedings have now been extended to anyone who has been in the country for up to two years.
[00:44:05.032 --> 00:44:18.125]  The Washington Post reports, another new provision would be to immediately return Mexican immigrants who are apprehended at the border back home, pending the outcomes of their deportation hearings, rather than house them on U.S.
[00:44:18.185 --> 00:44:22.650]  property, an effort that would save detention space and other resources.
[00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:30.293]  Still, former President Obama's lax policies continue their stranglehold on a minority of Border Patrol sectors.
[00:44:30.533 --> 00:44:39.777]  Polizet reports, Brandon Judd, President of the National Border Patrol Council, told LifeZette, that we're still walking people out the door.
[00:44:39.997 --> 00:44:43.699]  The catch and release policy is still in place in some sectors.
[00:44:44.019 --> 00:44:45.940]  This is not the administration's fault.
[00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:47.541]  This is Border Patrol's fault.
[00:44:47.741 --> 00:44:49.862]  It varies from sector to sector.
[00:44:50.182 --> 00:44:55.585]  Some sectors still are operating under the Obama administration's policies, and that's troubling.
[00:44:55.945 --> 00:45:00.828]  Judd said it was a minority of sectors that have been resisting Trump's new directives.
[00:45:01.028 --> 00:45:03.129]  He laid the blame at the feet of the U.S.
[00:45:03.189 --> 00:45:06.151]  Border Patrol managers, not frontline officers.
[00:45:06.551 --> 00:45:12.797]  Meanwhile, the interior of the United States continues to brace for the flow of still more refugees.
[00:45:13.118 --> 00:45:28.933]  As the Associated Press reports, fellow refugees say at least 140 Somalis have been settled in the United States after being blocked for days by President Donald Trump's ban on travelers from, quote, seven Muslim-majority countries, end quote.
[00:45:29.113 --> 00:45:36.018]  The Associated Press obviously still playing the Muslim card when the ban of those seven countries was terrorist related.
[00:45:36.259 --> 00:45:40.422]  Meanwhile, anti-Trump politics play a dangerous game with U.S.
[00:45:40.502 --> 00:45:41.483]  national security.
[00:45:41.563 --> 00:45:55.694]  The New York Post reports, an illegal immigrant gang member from El Salvador was allowed to walk free from Rikers Island under Mayor Bill de Blasio's Sanctuary City law, in defiance of a federal petition to hold him for deportation.
[00:45:55.834 --> 00:46:04.558]  This man is by his own admission a member of a violent street gang and he was released back into the community, said Thomas Decker, field office director for the U.S.
[00:46:04.598 --> 00:46:07.520]  Immigration and Customs Enforcement Unit in New York.
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:12.542]  De Blasio has become so blinded by leftist anti-national security sentiment,
[00:46:12.642 --> 00:46:12.882]  We're good.
[00:46:28.115 --> 00:46:39.117]  As a Syrian immigrant whose family fled Aleppo in 1980, weeks before hundreds of civilians were killed in a brutal siege, Michael Ghassali knows well the horrors facing today's refugees.
[00:46:39.297 --> 00:46:54.600]  But as the mayor of Montvale, Ghassali said, his allegiance is to the laws of his adopted country, even those he may personally disagree with, as President Trump continues to clean up just one area of former President Obama's lingering mess.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.460]  John Bound for InfoWars.com
[00:47:02.975 --> 00:47:07.758]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.418 --> 00:47:10.019]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.399 --> 00:47:15.402]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.762 --> 00:47:21.206]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.606 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.116]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.316 --> 00:48:30.300]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:34.064]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.204 --> 00:48:37.326]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.386 --> 00:48:45.654]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.794 --> 00:48:48.416]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.436 --> 00:48:49.477]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.817 --> 00:48:50.498]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.538 --> 00:48:51.159]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.519 --> 00:48:59.065]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.085 --> 00:48:59.946]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.966 --> 00:49:00.006]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:08.413 --> 00:49:18.738]  Senator Chuck Grassley from Iowa holds a series of town hall meetings every once in a while, and he held one in Parkersville, Iowa this week, one of multiple town halls that he held.
[00:49:19.178 --> 00:49:23.881]  This is a very brave thing that he does, something I admire that I think more politicians should do.
[00:49:24.281 --> 00:49:26.322]  Let's go to some of the highlights from this town hall meeting.
[00:49:26.582 --> 00:49:39.771]  Though there's a lot of disagreement in these meetings, let's remember the vast majority of Iowans voted for Senator Grassley and support his positions, and the majority of Iowans voted for Donald Trump.
[00:49:40.332 --> 00:49:47.777]  And we want Obamacare repeal.
[00:49:48.177 --> 00:49:52.961]  We want the wall bill.
[00:49:55.366 --> 00:50:01.190]  So here you have this man coming up trying to bring people together, and what do we hear from the peanut gallery?
[00:50:01.491 --> 00:50:05.113]  They say, oh, it didn't happen, or oh, let's hear the next lie.
[00:50:05.554 --> 00:50:08.176]  All he did was get up there and cite facts.
[00:50:08.616 --> 00:50:11.118]  That's all he did, and you saw what happened with the people.
[00:50:11.158 --> 00:50:13.559]  They got all up in arms and they completely denied reality.
[00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:14.560]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:17.582]  The election was not reflective of where the American people are.
[00:50:17.602 --> 00:50:22.066]  I want to point out that you lost the popular vote.
[00:50:22.926 --> 00:50:23.687]  This is a move
[00:50:24.895 --> 00:50:25.456]  We're good to go.
[00:50:38.344 --> 00:50:46.652]  So there you hear the typical talking points, fascism, yada yada, parroting the same thing he sees on TV, and then he says the popular vote.
[00:50:46.672 --> 00:50:49.695]  Look, I got news for all these people that keep citing the popular vote.
[00:50:50.056 --> 00:50:53.139]  That's not how the presidential election is decided, okay?
[00:50:53.559 --> 00:50:54.780]  So, I'm sorry.
[00:50:54.961 --> 00:50:55.882]  That's not how it works.
[00:50:56.142 --> 00:50:56.963]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:50:57.503 --> 00:51:07.977]  I'm deeply disturbed and frightened by what you are doing as far as the divisiveness that you are feeding in this nation.
[00:51:08.558 --> 00:51:12.504]  We're reflective of the American people and the American people should be ashamed!
[00:51:15.973 --> 00:51:18.075]  And then he gives himself a nice round of applause.
[00:51:18.415 --> 00:51:23.119]  He is the one that is actually up here feeding the divisiveness by buying into the propaganda.
[00:51:23.159 --> 00:51:25.241]  I mean, I feel bad for these people, honestly, folks.
[00:51:25.261 --> 00:51:30.025]  You can hear the conviction and the passion in his voice, but it's all hearsay.
[00:51:30.325 --> 00:51:32.287]  It's all fed by propaganda.
[00:51:32.547 --> 00:51:35.650]  And then he becomes the epitome of what he's trying to fight.
[00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:36.791]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:51:36.831 --> 00:51:41.555]  What steps will you take to make sure that there is an independent and thorough investigation
[00:51:41.956 --> 00:51:46.155]  Of the Trump-Putin-Russian intelligence agency's connections.
[00:51:51.388 --> 00:52:13.802]  So this guy is up here completely buying the Russian propaganda and I'm convinced that all the people that buy that are never going to be satisfied until they just until you just come out and say okay fine it was Russia fine it was Russia it was Russia Russia's doing everything
[00:52:14.062 --> 00:52:16.264]  That's all that's going to satisfy them.
[00:52:16.644 --> 00:52:20.147]  But then he goes on and he talks about the enemy.
[00:52:20.527 --> 00:52:22.308]  The enemy was communism, sir.
[00:52:22.689 --> 00:52:23.009]  Okay?
[00:52:23.409 --> 00:52:24.230]  That was the enemy.
[00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:25.791]  I would think that you would understand that.
[00:52:26.151 --> 00:52:27.892]  Apparently, he forgot.
[00:52:27.973 --> 00:52:34.557]  But again, they even announced today in a meeting on Capitol Hill they could not prove any Russian meddling in the election.
[00:52:34.718 --> 00:52:39.021]  We have serious issues that the Affordable Care Act has fixed and we have to keep those things.
[00:52:39.346 --> 00:52:41.468]  The Affordable Care Act has fixed these issues.
[00:52:41.968 --> 00:52:42.148]  No.
[00:52:42.308 --> 00:52:43.349]  You need to understand something.
[00:52:43.729 --> 00:52:45.571]  We don't have a health care problem.
[00:52:45.871 --> 00:52:47.793]  We have a health problem.
[00:52:48.093 --> 00:52:48.393]  Okay?
[00:52:48.913 --> 00:52:54.298]  We already spend more money than any other country on our health care, yet we're still one of the most unhealthy countries in the world.
[00:52:54.758 --> 00:52:58.381]  And you think that throwing more money is going to solve the problem?
[00:52:58.841 --> 00:52:59.021]  No.
[00:52:59.442 --> 00:53:06.527]  We need to figure out the actual health issues we have, then maybe we can address the health care of those issues.
[00:53:06.747 --> 00:53:07.528]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:53:07.688 --> 00:53:09.349]  Well, mine sort of is a question.
[00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:18.117]  So the other day you were asked to use your leadership role among Republicans to make Trump be more truthful.
[00:53:18.518 --> 00:53:23.222]  And your response was Trump will be Trump and that you don't know him that well.
[00:53:23.883 --> 00:53:31.770]  Well, to me, that says, you know, he is a liar and a con man and you are not going to hold him accountable.
[00:53:32.450 --> 00:53:41.056]  Senator Grassley, will you call Trump out on his blatant lies, or continue to let Trump lie to the American people?
[00:53:41.176 --> 00:53:46.020]  Wow, that was a really impassioned speech that you just wrote down there that you managed to read off.
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:48.962]  You weren't sure if it was a question or not, but you were still able to get it out.
[00:53:49.522 --> 00:53:51.063]  But you didn't cite one lie!
[00:53:51.784 --> 00:53:52.424]  Amazing!
[00:53:52.464 --> 00:54:01.030]  He's this big, huge liar, and you're gonna present this information to Senator Grassley, and then you don't cite a single lie.
[00:54:01.431 --> 00:54:01.591]  Hmm.
[00:54:02.011 --> 00:54:06.255]  You might want to go back to the drawing board there, buddy, and maybe cut fluoride out of the diet as well.
[00:54:06.495 --> 00:54:07.316]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:54:07.536 --> 00:54:11.960]  The criminality of people who are native born is much higher than people who are immigrants.
[00:54:13.951 --> 00:54:22.656]  Okay, so that's a nice little factoid she put out there, which could be correct, and of course all the hearsay mafia goes crazy over it, but we're talking about illegal immigrants here!
[00:54:22.936 --> 00:54:24.837]  Not immigrants, illegal immigrants!
[00:54:24.937 --> 00:54:26.058]  They can't get their head around it.
[00:54:26.098 --> 00:54:26.738]  Roll to the next one.
[00:54:26.758 --> 00:54:37.744]  Just in case you don't know, we've been a welcoming nation for refugees since World War II, at least, and we're going to continue to be a welcoming nation for refugees as well.
[00:54:39.065 --> 00:54:40.286]  Until two or three years ago,
[00:54:40.786 --> 00:54:45.810]  You wouldn't have been asking me this question, and you wouldn't have written me the letter, and I wouldn't have given you the answer I gave you.
[00:54:46.171 --> 00:55:00.343]  Because, maybe a couple years ago, that's when the people in that part of the world said that they were going to send terrorists in under the refugee umbrella that we have in this country to get terrorists in here to kill Americans.
[00:55:00.663 --> 00:55:04.164]  Three-fourths of our refugees come from Southeast Asia or Africa.
[00:55:04.404 --> 00:55:05.864]  They don't come from the Middle East.
[00:55:06.744 --> 00:55:11.185]  And so we're going to continue to take from Southeast and from Africa.
[00:55:11.385 --> 00:55:16.066]  But from this part of the world where they're threatening, that's what we've got to be careful about.
[00:55:16.086 --> 00:55:23.188]  I think you're going with a politics of fear and not the welcoming beliefs that the
[00:55:27.669 --> 00:55:37.955]  I feel guilty every time we have 90 people killed in Orlando, 2 in Chattanooga, 2 in Boston.
[00:55:38.275 --> 00:55:41.657]  So he starts saying facts and the crowd just goes loud to try to drown him out.
[00:55:41.878 --> 00:55:43.419]  But this is why these town halls are great.
[00:55:43.619 --> 00:55:47.421]  That was a powerful dialogue right there from Chuck Grassley speaking to his constituents.
[00:55:47.621 --> 00:55:48.422]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:56:05.418 --> 00:56:07.861]  Oh yeah, so here she is, the typical hearsay mafia.
[00:56:08.121 --> 00:56:10.605]  Funny, Trump was the one who put country over party.
[00:56:10.685 --> 00:56:14.491]  Remember, he wouldn't sign on to the Republicans because he wasn't sure if they'd treat him fairly.
[00:56:14.851 --> 00:56:19.518]  Turns out, he didn't get fair treatment, but he chose country over party, and that's why he won the election.
[00:56:19.719 --> 00:56:20.520]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:23.723]  The minimum wage is $7.25 since 2009.
[00:56:24.124 --> 00:56:35.816]  If you go to work for 40 hours a week and work 52 weeks a year with no vacation, you've earned $15,200 a year, which is just enough to be a member of the working poor.
[00:56:36.217 --> 00:56:39.280]  If you have a family, you're actually in poverty at that wage.
[00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:50.325]  So according to this guy, it's the government's job to make sure your family is taken care of, not your job to be a responsible parent or a responsible individual and not start a family when you have a minimum wage job.
[00:56:50.665 --> 00:56:52.485]  No, the government needs to step in and take care of you.
[00:56:52.766 --> 00:56:53.566]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:56:53.606 --> 00:56:55.387]  If we have high unemployment,
[00:56:56.187 --> 00:57:01.048]  Then I don't want to increase the cost of labor because you increase the cost of something, you get less of it.
[00:57:01.128 --> 00:57:05.349]  And again, this is why, to me, these town halls are so valuable and I'd like to see more of them.
[00:57:05.669 --> 00:57:06.769]  That's a great dialogue.
[00:57:06.809 --> 00:57:07.889]  That guy provides a point.
[00:57:08.209 --> 00:57:09.810]  Chuck Grassley provides a counterpoint.
[00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:10.970]  He wins the argument.
[00:57:11.010 --> 00:57:13.451]  Of course, again, this guy just wants the government to take care of everything.
[00:57:13.691 --> 00:57:17.071]  And like the guy said before, communism used to be our enemy.
[00:57:17.351 --> 00:57:18.192]  Let's roll to the next one.
[00:57:18.292 --> 00:57:20.132]  No other issue concerns me like climate change.
[00:57:27.745 --> 00:57:29.166]  ...habitable planet to live on.
[00:57:29.646 --> 00:57:34.448]  All these other issues that we've mentioned here and will be mentioned here are moot.
[00:57:34.588 --> 00:57:40.631]  Senator, we need a Manhattan Project-type effort with an unlimited budget to thwart this crisis.
[00:57:41.392 --> 00:57:42.472]  Yes, I said unlimited.
[00:57:43.913 --> 00:57:48.535]  For what it's worth, you have my blessing to add trillions of dollars to the national debt to combat climate change.
[00:57:50.592 --> 00:57:51.373]  How do you like that?
[00:57:52.073 --> 00:57:56.397]  This guy just admitted he'd rather be a debt slave than be free.
[00:57:56.817 --> 00:58:00.501]  He'd rather put his children into trillions of dollars of debt.
[00:58:01.328 --> 00:58:03.368]  Because of climate change.
[00:58:03.568 --> 00:58:06.609]  And then, of course, it was nice, he says, without a planet, we won't even be able to live here.
[00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:09.990]  Hey, buddy, without America, you wouldn't be free.
[00:58:10.350 --> 00:58:14.891]  Without this country, you wouldn't be able to go to that little town hall meeting to have your voice heard.
[00:58:14.971 --> 00:58:15.511]  Okay, buddy?
[00:58:15.891 --> 00:58:23.152]  So, why don't you get up on that a little bit before you come and you spout off your nonsense about climate change and what might happen if we don't have a planet.
[00:58:23.452 --> 00:58:26.753]  Maybe you should start appreciating this country, and then you can appreciate the planet.
[00:58:27.173 --> 00:58:29.594]  Thanks to everybody who tuned in to InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:58:29.914 --> 00:58:30.395]  We'll be back.
[00:58:30.415 --> 00:58:31.695]  The Alex Jones Show, 11 a.m.
[00:58:31.715 --> 00:58:33.076]  Central, Nightly News, 7 p.m.
[00:58:33.116 --> 00:58:33.456]  Central.
[00:58:39.119 --> 00:58:45.803]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the InfoWars and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:58:46.063 --> 00:58:48.144]  You better believe you got one!
[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.934]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.394 --> 00:59:20.085]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.425 --> 00:59:24.166]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.726 --> 00:59:29.387]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.787 --> 00:59:36.008]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:59:36.308 --> 00:59:38.608]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:59:39.268 --> 00:59:41.709]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
