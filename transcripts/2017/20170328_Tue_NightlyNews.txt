[00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:20.438]  Welcome to the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.538 --> 00:00:21.259]  I'm David Knight.
[00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:22.720]  It's Tuesday, March 28th, 2017.
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.302]  Here are our top stories.
[00:00:28.264 --> 00:00:28.684]  Tonight.
[00:00:30.245 --> 00:00:40.032]  Years after inventing the Internet, globalist puppet Al Gore re-emerges to debut his sequel to An Inconvenient Truth.
[00:00:40.312 --> 00:00:45.215]  And this time he blames climate change on Brexit?
[00:00:45.956 --> 00:00:46.116]  Then.
[00:00:47.293 --> 00:00:55.961]  The establishment left wants you to believe that Team Trump and InfoWars colluded with the Russians to undermine the U.S.
[00:00:56.041 --> 00:00:57.322]  presidential election.
[00:00:57.722 --> 00:01:08.292]  But now it is the mainstream media who remains silent while Russia threatens to release a stockpile of Obama's dirty little secrets.
[00:01:15.791 --> 00:01:20.232]  All that plus much more up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.347 --> 00:01:36.952]  In case you haven't heard, InfoWars has become the most influential media outlet in America.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:02.011 --> 00:03:06.513]  Today, President Trump signed executive orders that are going to change things at the EPA.
[00:03:06.533 --> 00:03:09.515]  Yeah, there's climate change going on, and it's at the EPA.
[00:03:09.835 --> 00:03:12.036]  It's not global, folks, but it's changing.
[00:03:12.056 --> 00:03:13.317]  The climate is changing in D.C.
[00:03:13.737 --> 00:03:20.441]  As USA Today puts it, energy independence and not climate change become the priority under President Trump's order.
[00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:31.671]  This executive order they said is a sweeping repudiation, let's hope so, of Obama-era environmental initiatives substituting a strategy of combating climate change through international cooperation.
[00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:32.992]  That was Obama's approach.
[00:03:33.232 --> 00:03:35.254]  Let's do international cooperation.
[00:03:35.534 --> 00:03:42.360]  No, what he was talking about was creating a new world government, a governing body that was going to control our economies.
[00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:46.563]  So they're substituting for that an America First energy policy.
[00:03:46.603 --> 00:03:58.331]  Trump said this is the start of a new era of American energy production that would restore economic freedom and allow our workers to thrive and compete and succeed on a level playing field for the first time in a long time.
[00:03:58.611 --> 00:04:04.335]  He spoke at a signing ceremony at the EPA today on stage with a dozen coal miners.
[00:04:04.395 --> 00:04:05.055]  Why coal miners?
[00:04:05.075 --> 00:04:09.158]  Well, as we all know, they were the ones that Obama and Hillary had targeted for extinction.
[00:04:09.898 --> 00:04:11.360]  So that's the problem with the EPA.
[00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:19.869]  The EPA left its mission of clean water, clean air, and they had to grow their empire, their bureaucracy, so they brought in climate change.
[00:04:20.737 --> 00:04:23.619]  And they have stepped over the line in so many different areas.
[00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:29.123]  It's one of the things that we were all very excited about, with Pruitt being selected as the man to run the EPA.
[00:04:29.163 --> 00:04:36.929]  As Attorney General in Oklahoma, he had fought the unlawful actions of the EPA as much, if not more so, than any other Attorney General.
[00:04:36.989 --> 00:04:40.752]  And so hopefully we're going to see these policies roll back, but there are still some questions.
[00:04:40.772 --> 00:04:42.273]  We'll get to those in just one moment.
[00:04:42.693 --> 00:04:45.836]  They said under Obama, federal agencies were required to plan for
[00:04:46.556 --> 00:04:51.424]  The effects of climate change and treat it as a national security issue.
[00:04:51.564 --> 00:04:52.706]  Well, you know, quite frankly, it is.
[00:04:53.564 --> 00:05:01.189]  Quite frankly, our economy is a national security issue, and if you're going to shut down the economy over unicorn farts, then that is a national security issue.
[00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:12.197]  And understand that as they subsidized the solar power industry, and again, solar power can be very effective in an off-the-grid situation, but they don't want it in an off-the-grid situation.
[00:05:12.717 --> 00:05:20.563]  They want it in a grid situation, which creates massive issues of storage to smooth out the ups and downs of power supply.
[00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:27.524]  And so because they want to keep control, because they want to have a centralized grid, solar power doesn't work even with their massive subsidies.
[00:05:27.584 --> 00:05:30.506]  None of these renewables do work on that kind of a basis.
[00:05:31.207 --> 00:05:38.913]  But they're going to shut things down anyway, and they made a move in the face of Fukushima, as Fukushima was creating all these problems that it still, to this day, is creating.
[00:05:38.933 --> 00:05:42.596]  Remember all the robots that have gone in and been killed by the radiation.
[00:05:42.636 --> 00:05:43.817]  What is it doing to the environment?
[00:05:43.837 --> 00:05:45.279]  Well, the environmentalists don't care.
[00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:48.481]  They're not concerned about nuclear energy.
[00:05:48.521 --> 00:05:53.824]  They're not concerned about the storage of spent nuclear reactors or the fuel rods.
[00:05:53.924 --> 00:05:56.625]  They're only concerned about carbon dioxide.
[00:05:57.506 --> 00:06:04.730]  Also at the ceremony was Vice President Pence, along with Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, an Interior Secretary, and the EPA Administrator.
[00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.052]  They said, said Pence, the war on coal is over.
[00:06:08.072 --> 00:06:11.955]  And of course that was the word that was pronounced by both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
[00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:13.896]  But listen to this quote from Al Gore.
[00:06:13.936 --> 00:06:20.142]  He says, a misguided step away from a sustainable carbon-free future for ourselves and our generations to come.
[00:06:20.182 --> 00:06:21.103]  He said that's what this is.
[00:06:21.604 --> 00:06:24.547]  A misguided step away from a carbon-free future.
[00:06:25.207 --> 00:06:25.988]  Well listen, idiot.
[00:06:26.568 --> 00:06:29.731]  If you have a carbon-free future, all the plants and animals will die.
[00:06:29.792 --> 00:06:33.055]  Carbon dioxide is what plants need to exist.
[00:06:33.475 --> 00:06:36.017]  We don't want a carbon-free future for the
[00:06:36.638 --> 00:06:38.059]  Scientifically illiterate out there.
[00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:46.946]  James Dellenpole pointed this out last week that Al Gore is going around selling his new movie saying that Brexit was a product of climate change.
[00:06:47.206 --> 00:06:50.109]  What is the perverted logic line here that he's got?
[00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:53.572]  Well, Al Gore believes that the problems that are going on in Syria
[00:06:54.232 --> 00:06:54.712]  We're good to go.
[00:07:24.088 --> 00:07:24.368]  I think
[00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:43.879]  Legacy.
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:50.224]  But it does not go, they say, as far as some conservatives would like to dismantle the EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gases.
[00:07:50.805 --> 00:07:51.665]  And this is important.
[00:07:51.705 --> 00:07:54.347]  Nor will it begin to separate the U.S.
[00:07:54.768 --> 00:07:57.510]  from a landmark international climate accord.
[00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:58.150]  Okay?
[00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.092]  Now, this is the devil in the details here, folks.
[00:08:01.392 --> 00:08:02.894]  What is that climate accord they're talking about?
[00:08:02.914 --> 00:08:07.097]  Well, it's the Paris Climate Change Treaty that we signed onto, that they signed us onto.
[00:08:07.717 --> 00:08:14.424]  They didn't get it ratified exactly, but they just said, well, we're going to have the Secretary of State sign it, the President sign it, and that's enough.
[00:08:15.065 --> 00:08:21.492]  So that treaty is not really in effect, but the sad thing about this is how this is being opposed within the Trump administration.
[00:08:21.512 --> 00:08:27.298]  They say Trump is not expected to tell the EPA to reconsider the underlying policy that lets it regulate carbon emissions.
[00:08:27.358 --> 00:08:28.939]  The 2009 endangerment finding
[00:08:30.581 --> 00:08:35.366]  In which it declared that greenhouse gas pollution threatens human health and welfare.
[00:08:35.446 --> 00:08:39.591]  Nor will he address the 2015 Paris Climate Accord.
[00:08:40.251 --> 00:08:41.473]  Now understand what this means.
[00:08:42.233 --> 00:08:46.518]  As they're talking about this and saying these executive orders are going to be taken to court.
[00:08:47.591 --> 00:08:51.474]  And they're saying, well, we're not going to take this that far.
[00:08:51.494 --> 00:08:55.278]  We're not going to challenge the endangerment finding, because if we did, that would turn into a large legal battle.
[00:08:55.978 --> 00:09:02.924]  It will be a large legal battle because of the endangerment finding if you don't attack the foundations of what Obama has built.
[00:09:03.224 --> 00:09:05.006]  This is what's true of Obamacare as well.
[00:09:05.306 --> 00:09:08.008]  If you don't attack the foundations, the structures that he's set up,
[00:09:08.857 --> 00:09:11.738]  Your efforts to modify this around the edges will not hold.
[00:09:12.338 --> 00:09:16.679]  I don't think that this executive order is going to hold if they're not willing to fight the endangerment finding.
[00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:24.501]  If they can't fight the fundamental statement that was made by the EPA and Obama that this endangers human life, then the courts are not going to side with them.
[00:09:25.102 --> 00:09:29.103]  They say, well, you can't fight this in the courts because you're going to have to fight the scientific consensus.
[00:09:29.123 --> 00:09:30.043]  Well, that has been fought.
[00:09:30.763 --> 00:09:32.163]  And that has been defeated.
[00:09:33.224 --> 00:09:37.325]  We had Lord Monckton defeat Al Gore in Britain against a hostile judge.
[00:09:38.277 --> 00:09:47.421]  He said that inconvenient truth was a convenient lie, and he proved it in court, and yet that hostile judge who really said, okay, you win, but we're not going to give you anything.
[00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:48.701]  It was essentially a pyrrhic victory.
[00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:58.225]  They said, he can still show this propaganda film to school children, but we'll accompany it with some kind of a legal disclaimer document, which you know they're not going to read, nor will their parents.
[00:09:59.186 --> 00:10:03.327]  So, to that degree, it was a pyrrhic victory, but we know that science is not on their side.
[00:10:04.068 --> 00:10:07.109]  Science is not won by consensus.
[00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:10.511]  It is won by facts, and so we can argue this fact.
[00:10:10.551 --> 00:10:17.553]  But if you leave that in place, and if you leave the Paris Climate Accord in place, that is going to undermine all of this.
[00:10:17.573 --> 00:10:19.934]  We're not going to have any real substantive change.
[00:10:20.374 --> 00:10:21.194]  And that's the true issue.
[00:10:21.254 --> 00:10:23.315]  Where is that opposition coming from?
[00:10:24.292 --> 00:10:28.956]  Well, the reports are that it's coming from Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump.
[00:10:28.996 --> 00:10:35.961]  They want to remain in the Paris Climate Change Treaty, which I frankly do not understand.
[00:10:36.802 --> 00:10:43.227]  And this is the way it was summed up by James Dillingpole, the guy who just pointed out that Al Gore is telling the world that
[00:10:44.508 --> 00:10:45.689]  Climate change created Brexit.
[00:10:45.769 --> 00:10:57.075]  The Darling Poll said, what President Trump needs now, more than ever, are administrators with the political will to do the right thing, which is, after all, the reason so many Americans voted for him.
[00:10:57.676 --> 00:11:02.938]  He needs to get advisors who share the agenda that he campaigned on, and that's the problem.
[00:11:03.359 --> 00:11:11.063]  And we look at this, the big tent, and bringing in people who know how to get things done, but they're not on board with the basic fundamental structures that need to be removed.
[00:11:12.025 --> 00:11:16.107]  We cannot allow the endangerment clause to stay there because that will ultimately change.
[00:11:16.427 --> 00:11:27.493]  If he can get rid of the Obama Clean Air Act, then what the courts will eventually demand if the endangerment clause stays there, is that there will be a Trump Clean Air Accord.
[00:11:27.533 --> 00:11:30.555]  Okay, so that's what we have to be concerned about.
[00:11:31.482 --> 00:11:43.487]  No, it's also pointed out by the Washington Post, they said, don't worry, don't worry all of you leftist environmentalists, because even though they're going to change, may change some of these things at the EPA, we still have removable mandates in 30 states, and they're exactly right.
[00:11:44.267 --> 00:11:48.629]  At the state, and even sometimes at the city level, just as we're seeing with sanctuary cities.
[00:11:49.471 --> 00:12:09.298]  There are prohibitions on using oil and coal and things like that to generate power and they're saying you must use wind or you must use solar and as I pointed out they do not work on a grid system because we do not have the technology to store the power that varies with wind and with solar.
[00:12:09.598 --> 00:12:14.360]  They work very well on an individual basis and they're a great strategy to get off of the control grid.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.703]  But they do not give us reliable, affordable power.
[00:12:18.783 --> 00:12:25.027]  They're subsidizing these industries, and they are picking the winners and choosers, which is exactly why we don't want to see this happen.
[00:12:25.608 --> 00:12:32.392]  Well, in other news today, we see that Russia is actually threatening to leak things that Obama asked Moscow to keep secret.
[00:12:32.433 --> 00:12:33.934]  This is an article from Gateway Pundit.
[00:12:34.676 --> 00:12:42.302]  And this was something that was a back-and-forth in Russia by the Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova.
[00:12:42.322 --> 00:12:45.604]  And she was asked about the current state of U.S.-Russian relations.
[00:12:46.465 --> 00:12:48.346]  And listen to what she has to say.
[00:12:48.386 --> 00:12:48.967]  Here's the question.
[00:12:49.367 --> 00:12:51.048]  How do you see the future of Russian-U.S.
[00:12:51.068 --> 00:12:53.971]  diplomatic relations in the context of the current atmosphere in Washington?
[00:12:54.651 --> 00:12:58.934]  Can you confirm that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will be coming to Moscow in April?
[00:12:59.435 --> 00:13:00.355]  And what she said was this.
[00:13:00.375 --> 00:13:09.062]  She said, well, to tell the truth, over the past few years, we've seen many strange things happen in Washington in connection with preparations for visits or for talks by our foreign ministers.
[00:13:09.482 --> 00:13:09.943]  The U.S.
[00:13:09.983 --> 00:13:15.407]  State Department has more than once asked us not to announce planned visits until the last minute.
[00:13:16.027 --> 00:13:17.007]  This is not our tradition.
[00:13:17.507 --> 00:13:18.488]  But what happened after that?
[00:13:18.608 --> 00:13:19.468]  Well, first the U.S.
[00:13:19.488 --> 00:13:25.329]  State Department asked us to keep the planned visit quiet, not to announce it until the last possible minute, until we coordinated the date.
[00:13:25.929 --> 00:13:26.830]  We did as they asked.
[00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:30.070]  But a day or two later, the information was leaked by the U.S.
[00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:31.471]  State Department, sometimes by the U.S.
[00:13:31.511 --> 00:13:32.111]  administration.
[00:13:32.531 --> 00:13:38.933]  This put Russia and the media in a strange situation because they didn't know who to believe, the official agencies or the many leaks.
[00:13:39.573 --> 00:13:41.293]  Does it sound familiar?
[00:13:41.513 --> 00:13:42.934]  Does it sound like what they're doing to Donald Trump?
[00:13:42.974 --> 00:13:44.554]  Does it sound like the way these bureaucracies work?
[00:13:45.325 --> 00:14:00.620]  They want to be the ones to break the news, so they tell you don't tell us, don't tell anybody any information about this upcoming meeting, and then all of a sudden, until we get the details worked out, and then they leak something out, and then the Russians aren't really even sure if this is true or not, because they haven't set on the date.
[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.082]  But then she says this, which is even more interesting.
[00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:21.332]  She says, also, I would like to say that if the practice of leaking information that concerns not just the United States but also Russia, which has become a tradition in Washington over the past few years, if this continues, there will come a day when the media will publish leaks about the things that Washington asked us to keep secret.
[00:14:21.672 --> 00:14:26.134]  For example, things that happened during President Obama's term in office.
[00:14:26.214 --> 00:14:29.856]  Believe me, this could be very interesting information.
[00:14:29.876 --> 00:14:30.937]  Do you get that?
[00:14:32.257 --> 00:14:39.343]  In other words, if you keep annoying us, we're going to leak out some stuff that Obama wanted to keep secret, and you're going to find this very interesting.
[00:14:39.383 --> 00:14:48.611]  Now, as they point out in the Gateway Pundit, what if the same thing had been said, but it's substitute for President Obama, President Trump?
[00:14:48.852 --> 00:14:56.078]  What if they'd said, well believe me, things keep up, we're going to let out some stuff that President Trump would like to have secret, and believe me, you're going to find that interesting.
[00:14:56.438 --> 00:14:57.199]  Now they didn't say that.
[00:14:57.699 --> 00:15:01.200]  They said that they might leak some stuff out from President Obama, and you might find it interesting.
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:01.701]  And guess what?
[00:15:01.981 --> 00:15:03.141]  Nobody's talking about it.
[00:15:03.782 --> 00:15:05.222]  It's kept pretty quiet there.
[00:15:05.262 --> 00:15:08.684]  Meanwhile, Donald Trump has called for investigating the Clintons-Russian ties.
[00:15:08.724 --> 00:15:10.004]  We saw this a couple of days ago.
[00:15:10.424 --> 00:15:21.469]  He took to Twitter, it was actually last night, asked why congressional lawmakers are not probing various deals, transactions, and connections former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have to Russia.
[00:15:22.009 --> 00:15:22.649]  And here's the tweets.
[00:15:22.669 --> 00:15:23.330]  Trump-Russia story is a hoax.
[00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:28.172]  And when he's talking about the Podesta-Russian company, remember, that's the fact that Podesta, who is Hillary's campaign manager, who was
[00:15:47.808 --> 00:16:00.135]  A high up in the Bill Clinton administration and also in the Obama administration that he worked for and owned stock in a Russian government owned company that was founded by Vladimir Putin.
[00:16:00.155 --> 00:16:01.635]  Had substantial stock in that company.
[00:16:01.856 --> 00:16:06.578]  He did not declare that stock when he joined the Obama administration's legal department in 2014.
[00:16:08.601 --> 00:16:10.962]  So yes, why are they not investigating that?
[00:16:11.022 --> 00:16:12.382]  Well, we know the answer to that, don't we?
[00:16:13.203 --> 00:16:27.488]  And then here's another interesting story here, because as they try to continue to sell this Russians hacked the election story, and as I said yesterday, if they had found anything at all in the months and months leading up to the election, or the months and months after the elections, and what now?
[00:16:27.628 --> 00:16:28.509]  Six, seven months now?
[00:16:29.669 --> 00:16:34.371]  That they've, since the election, but it was also going several months before that.
[00:16:34.471 --> 00:16:36.352]  If they'd found anything, they would have told everybody.
[00:16:37.073 --> 00:16:38.334]  So there really is nothing there.
[00:16:38.394 --> 00:16:48.125]  Yet, now we're starting to see, and this is coming from Politico, very much on the Democrat, on the Hillary Clinton side, Democrats realize that they were burned by their polling.
[00:16:48.505 --> 00:16:49.727]  They had a blind spot.
[00:16:49.787 --> 00:16:50.888]  What was their blind spot?
[00:16:50.968 --> 00:16:56.975]  Well, they didn't just lose among rural white voters, they didn't even bother to poll them.
[00:16:58.206 --> 00:17:05.908]  Who would have guessed that the Democrats wouldn't care enough about white voters, especially white rural voters, that they would even bother to poll them.
[00:17:05.948 --> 00:17:15.891]  But as they point out of Politico, in order to win those voters back, or even to figure out how to win without them, you need to measure the size of the rural working class white vote.
[00:17:16.471 --> 00:17:16.991]  They didn't.
[00:17:17.672 --> 00:17:24.234]  What we're looking at here, folks, is now the beginning of some more confessions about how grossly incompetent they were.
[00:17:24.574 --> 00:17:26.315]  They didn't have the election stolen from them.
[00:17:26.555 --> 00:17:28.816]  It was theirs to lose and they lost it big time.
[00:17:29.316 --> 00:17:36.619]  And they said the first evidence of the party's blind spot in polling surfaced during a gubernatorial race in 2015 in Kentucky.
[00:17:36.679 --> 00:17:41.041]  They showed the Democrat candidate, Conway, beating the Republican candidate, Bevin,
[00:17:42.081 --> 00:17:50.649]  Uh, and they said that Conway had a three point lead in the final real clear politics average, but Bevin won by a comfortable nine point margin.
[00:17:50.989 --> 00:17:54.472]  So they show him winning by three, but he lost by nine.
[00:17:54.492 --> 00:17:55.633]  That's a pretty big spread.
[00:17:56.174 --> 00:17:59.056]  That's exactly the type of thing we see continually.
[00:17:59.096 --> 00:17:59.496]  Meanwhile,
[00:18:00.197 --> 00:18:01.617]  As we see this record U.S.
[00:18:01.718 --> 00:18:08.320]  property taxes coming in 2016, 541 billion dollars in state and local governments in fiscal 2013.
[00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:13.861]  The previous record was 2009, it was 527 billion.
[00:18:13.901 --> 00:18:20.363]  Now we see that in California, they are cutting budgets if the white population gets above 30% in the schools.
[00:18:20.384 --> 00:18:21.404]  Do you realize that?
[00:18:21.444 --> 00:18:25.805]  Here's a parent who says, hey the class sizes are getting larger, you're taking resources away from our students.
[00:18:25.825 --> 00:18:27.646]  And the person who said that was Rosemary Estrada.
[00:18:28.266 --> 00:18:31.727]  Now, is she considered to be a white person because she's Hispanic and an American?
[00:18:32.627 --> 00:18:38.749]  Or is it the fact that the Hispanic students are getting hurt by this and not just the white students?
[00:18:38.989 --> 00:18:42.669]  Remember, we got 23% of public school children are now living in immigrant housing.
[00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:52.112]  But if the population of, and that's okay, because we can provide and should provide in the language of their choice any foreign citizens who care to come here and live at our expense.
[00:18:52.152 --> 00:18:54.132]  So we pay for their schooling and they're 23%.
[00:18:54.552 --> 00:18:57.573]  But if it gets above 30% of whites, then they cut the funding.
[00:18:58.476 --> 00:18:58.896]  There we go.
[00:18:58.996 --> 00:18:59.977]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:19:01.177 --> 00:19:03.419]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[00:19:03.699 --> 00:19:15.725]  The missing link of why our ancestors, whether you were in Africa or ancient Albion, which is England today, why our ancestors were so much stronger.
[00:19:15.745 --> 00:19:23.290]  I mean, there are huge archaeological reports, all sorts of anthropology studies, you can look them up for yourself, that show
[00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:32.436]  That humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[00:19:32.576 --> 00:19:38.740]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.462]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[00:19:42.462 --> 00:19:43.703]  People are falling apart.
[00:19:43.723 --> 00:19:44.724]  They're totally depressed.
[00:19:44.744 --> 00:19:45.284]  They're not happy.
[00:19:45.865 --> 00:19:46.845]  What is going on?
[00:19:48.126 --> 00:19:51.969]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[00:19:53.206 --> 00:19:55.727]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[00:19:56.167 --> 00:19:57.868]  Today we call it bone broth.
[00:19:58.068 --> 00:20:05.072]  And for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:20:05.312 --> 00:20:13.616]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWars Life products.
[00:20:15.035 --> 00:20:21.547]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[00:20:21.928 --> 00:20:25.354]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:20:25.394 --> 00:20:26.456]  You used the skin.
[00:20:27.062 --> 00:20:34.207]  To cover yourself up for shelter, you use the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you use the bones for strength.
[00:20:34.727 --> 00:20:48.577]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[00:20:48.697 --> 00:20:50.158]  The bone is so amazing.
[00:20:50.578 --> 00:20:56.162]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[00:20:57.298 --> 00:21:00.200]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[00:21:00.741 --> 00:21:06.185]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:15.952]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[00:21:16.212 --> 00:21:20.756]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[00:21:20.996 --> 00:21:22.797]  This is a absolute win-win.
[00:21:22.857 --> 00:21:25.618]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
[00:21:25.918 --> 00:21:32.020]  You support InfoWars and all we're doing to promote freedom and the restoration of our Republic and promotion of freedom worldwide.
[00:21:33.321 --> 00:21:42.044]  The journey towards better health and giving our bodies these amazing compounds that God created starts at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:21:42.224 --> 00:21:46.606]  Three years in the making, incredible research and the very best ingredients.
[00:21:47.126 --> 00:21:49.727]  I'm Alex Jones and I may not be a caveman,
[00:21:50.569 --> 00:21:53.739]  Compared to these trendies out there in the street, I'm as close as it gets.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.571]  Join me at InformersLife.com and get your caveman formula today.
[00:22:01.018 --> 00:22:04.381]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:06.743]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:22:06.923 --> 00:22:15.310]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.913]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:22:19.073 --> 00:22:28.080]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:36.962]  Supermale vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:22:37.162 --> 00:22:39.083]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:22:39.403 --> 00:22:46.985]  Supermale vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:53.532]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:22:53.833 --> 00:23:00.761]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Mel Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:23:02.935 --> 00:23:06.177]  Another day, another artificial intelligence accident.
[00:23:06.677 --> 00:23:14.903]  This one also in Arizona, not in Tempe, but in Phoenix, and a police motorcycle was struck by a Tesla car in self-driving mode.
[00:23:15.543 --> 00:23:16.984]  This happened actually last week.
[00:23:17.004 --> 00:23:20.286]  We heard over the weekend in Tempe, Arizona, there was an accident.
[00:23:20.306 --> 00:23:23.128]  You saw the driverless Uber car that was on its side.
[00:23:23.168 --> 00:23:24.809]  They said, well, it wasn't its fault.
[00:23:25.697 --> 00:23:26.458]  We'll see about that.
[00:23:26.518 --> 00:23:28.660]  We'll tell you a little bit more about Uber's driverless program.
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.442]  But, now this is in Phoenix, and it happened a couple of days earlier.
[00:23:31.482 --> 00:23:36.626]  I guess Tesla decided this was a good time to release information, so they didn't take the brunt of the criticism.
[00:23:37.067 --> 00:23:42.892]  They say a Phoenix police motorcycle was struck by a Tesla Model X, reportedly operating on autopilot, and it was last week, said the police.
[00:23:42.912 --> 00:23:49.737]  Now the interesting thing about this is that the police themselves say we would normally have not paid any attention to this, except it involved an officer.
[00:23:50.498 --> 00:23:53.939]  We would not have investigated it otherwise, but it involved an officer.
[00:23:53.979 --> 00:23:54.599]  Here's what happened.
[00:23:54.619 --> 00:23:59.540]  The officer, who was in front of the Tesla driver, exited off the freeway, stopped at the stoplight.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:06.341]  After also stopping briefly, the Tesla then began moving forward, prompting the officer to jump off his motorcycle and move away.
[00:24:06.421 --> 00:24:08.822]  Then the car struck the fallen motorcycle, kept going.
[00:24:09.002 --> 00:24:10.002]  I've had that happen to me too.
[00:24:10.542 --> 00:24:11.442]  With drunk drivers!
[00:24:11.842 --> 00:24:12.203]  Okay?
[00:24:12.743 --> 00:24:14.963]  And that's the point when we look at these accidents.
[00:24:15.743 --> 00:24:18.484]  At this point, the technology is not there.
[00:24:19.451 --> 00:24:31.500]  The fact that the government is pulling out all the stops to allow them to use us as guinea pigs on the streets should tell you something about where this is all headed in a very troubling way.
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.582]  See, this is not an issue about technology.
[00:24:34.662 --> 00:24:36.724]  This isn't even an issue whether you like cars or not.
[00:24:37.324 --> 00:24:42.768]  This is about privacy, this is about liberty, and this is about ownership.
[00:24:43.028 --> 00:24:44.629]  These are the issues that they're pushing on us.
[00:24:44.649 --> 00:24:46.471]  They want all the cars to be owned by very few people.
[00:24:47.071 --> 00:24:48.791]  They want to turn you into renters everywhere.
[00:24:48.811 --> 00:24:50.012]  We're going to see that in just a moment.
[00:24:50.672 --> 00:24:53.853]  But they also want to track everything that you're doing as part of the surveillance state.
[00:24:54.433 --> 00:24:57.174]  And they want to tax every mile that you drive.
[00:24:57.754 --> 00:25:01.675]  The government has a vested interest in this and so do the corporations that are pushing this on you.
[00:25:02.115 --> 00:25:07.276]  They say this happened at about three miles per hour, which is going to be about the average speed of these cars the first few years as well.
[00:25:07.956 --> 00:25:10.797]  That's also going to be an issue as we move forward.
[00:25:11.457 --> 00:25:17.023]  Now, when I say that they're not ready for the streets, that they are driving like drunk drivers, I'm not exaggerating.
[00:25:17.964 --> 00:25:25.592]  Remember yesterday, I talked about the documents that were obtained by Recode from Uber and their self-driving group.
[00:25:26.112 --> 00:25:34.020]  And this is what these documents tell us about so-called disengagements, which means that the human drivers who are there have to take over the wheel.
[00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:47.684]  During the week ending March 8th, the active cars in Uber's program only drove an average of 0.8 miles before the safety driver, the human, had to take over for some reason or the other.
[00:25:47.924 --> 00:25:56.233]  Now these reasons can include things like navigating unclear lane markings because they could not tell because there wasn't a clear lane marking.
[00:25:57.079 --> 00:25:59.880]  Then the self-driving car is not capable of staying in its lane.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:01.380]  Do we really want these cars?
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.120]  See, that's why I'm talking about a drunk driver.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:03.700]  Right?
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:05.141]  They don't know where the lanes are either.
[00:26:05.161 --> 00:26:06.161]  They're weaving all over the road.
[00:26:06.201 --> 00:26:07.021]  That's the same thing with this.
[00:26:07.041 --> 00:26:08.561]  So the drivers have to get in there.
[00:26:08.581 --> 00:26:17.023]  But understand that as we're talking about this, Google and others have pushed very hard to put their cars on the road that have no drivers.
[00:26:17.083 --> 00:26:19.244]  They don't have a requirement of having a driver in the seat.
[00:26:20.124 --> 00:26:25.825]  And they don't even have, in some of the vehicles that they're putting on the road, they don't even have steering wheels or brakes that a human could operate.
[00:26:26.653 --> 00:26:30.535]  Now it also includes things like overshooting a turn, or driving in inclement weather.
[00:26:30.575 --> 00:26:40.842]  They say the stat, however, excludes, does not even include, when they say they've got to take over the wheel less than every mile, doesn't include accidental disengagements, end-of-route disengagements, or early takeovers.
[00:26:41.522 --> 00:26:44.904]  Now there's something else that they're not including in that either, and that's critical interventions.
[00:26:44.964 --> 00:26:49.547]  These are incidents that would have resulted in a car hitting a person or causing more than $5,000 in property damage.
[00:26:51.195 --> 00:26:54.097]  Now those were happening every 100 to 200 miles.
[00:26:54.617 --> 00:26:56.819]  Again, do you want a driver like that?
[00:26:57.179 --> 00:27:02.162]  Let's not bow down and worship this because it's being done by some programmers, which is what Wired Magazine did.
[00:27:02.662 --> 00:27:08.806]  Wired Magazine said, well, this accident simply shows how terrible humans are at driving, the one that was in Tempe, Arizona.
[00:27:08.846 --> 00:27:09.686]  Let's blame the humans.
[00:27:09.727 --> 00:27:12.668]  Well, let's blame the humans who are doing the programming.
[00:27:12.828 --> 00:27:18.472]  Let's blame the humans who are crony capitalists working with the government to shove this technology down your throat.
[00:27:18.492 --> 00:27:19.633]  They're going to ram it down your throat
[00:27:20.333 --> 00:27:23.375]  Or they're going to ram your car with their drunk driving AI.
[00:27:23.395 --> 00:27:24.296]  Okay?
[00:27:24.676 --> 00:27:27.898]  And they have started up after Uber stopped this in Tempe, Arizona.
[00:27:28.318 --> 00:27:37.324]  They have now redeployed, and I think it's a good term to use that, as Wired puts it, they have redeployed their self-driving cars because that's a term that you usually use for weaponized stuff.
[00:27:37.344 --> 00:27:38.865]  Let me tell you how this is being weaponized.
[00:27:38.945 --> 00:27:44.469]  But before we do, and we'll get to that article here in a minute, they just stopped operating in Denver.
[00:27:44.529 --> 00:27:45.890]  There's a story behind that as well.
[00:27:46.897 --> 00:27:49.543]  They want to be treated with special preferential rules.
[00:27:49.583 --> 00:27:50.846]  We saw that happen here in Austin.
[00:27:51.147 --> 00:27:52.710]  It's happening in Denmark as well.
[00:27:53.131 --> 00:27:55.797]  They don't want the rules that are put on taxi companies put on them.
[00:27:57.042 --> 00:27:59.263]  They want to operate by a separate set of rules.
[00:27:59.323 --> 00:28:02.224]  Isn't that so typical of the big multinational corporations?
[00:28:02.304 --> 00:28:04.465]  One set of rules for them, one set of rules for you.
[00:28:04.885 --> 00:28:09.827]  One set of rules for Hillary, another for the people in the military and the national security agencies.
[00:28:10.167 --> 00:28:10.427]  Okay?
[00:28:10.807 --> 00:28:12.547]  They have different sets of rules for them.
[00:28:13.128 --> 00:28:19.810]  They were accused by Danish politicians and drivers unions of flouting regulations that taxi companies are subject to.
[00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:20.250]  Of course they are.
[00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:22.291]  There's a double standard there as we see everywhere.
[00:28:23.257 --> 00:28:26.138]  They have a double standard bias against human drivers as well.
[00:28:26.678 --> 00:28:31.339]  We see that in the tech press, especially companies like Wired Magazine.
[00:28:31.399 --> 00:28:35.700]  They are pushing a utopia designed by urban planners on us.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.661]  Understand, cars were there to get us out of the cities.
[00:28:38.721 --> 00:28:40.281]  We wanted to get to the suburbs.
[00:28:40.761 --> 00:28:47.203]  And as soon as people had transportation that could do it, in other words, cars, that was what that whole thing in the middle of the 20th century was about.
[00:28:47.805 --> 00:28:48.645]  We created suburbs.
[00:28:48.685 --> 00:28:50.506]  People said, I don't like living in crowded cities.
[00:28:50.546 --> 00:28:51.927]  Well, they want you in crowded cities.
[00:28:52.167 --> 00:28:54.468]  They want you in cities that are more crowded than they have ever been.
[00:28:55.169 --> 00:29:01.131]  They want you in their Agenda 21, UN Agenda 2030 sustainability cities, where you're going to have a 200 square foot apartment.
[00:29:01.412 --> 00:29:02.732]  You're going to barely be able to afford that.
[00:29:02.752 --> 00:29:04.293]  You probably will have to rent that from them.
[00:29:05.113 --> 00:29:08.435]  And then you will have to rent your transportation from them if they will let you do that.
[00:29:09.113 --> 00:29:15.057]  Now, there was an article at the beginning of this last month, March 3rd, how Uber deceives authorities worldwide.
[00:29:15.077 --> 00:29:20.761]  And this is something that is interesting to consider in light of the fact that they pulled out of Denmark, because Denmark didn't want them there.
[00:29:20.781 --> 00:29:25.325]  They say, Uber has for years engaged in a worldwide program to deceive authorities and markets.
[00:29:26.055 --> 00:29:27.816]  They use a tool called Grayball.
[00:29:27.856 --> 00:29:38.805]  If they're concerned that there's going to be a regulatory agency or someone who is going to be working for the government that's going to be looking at their cars or seeing if they're operating there, they identify these people.
[00:29:39.385 --> 00:29:46.231]  And as you use the Uber app, you realize that you can see the car, you can watch these little cars on your screen as they're moving towards you to pick you up.
[00:29:46.271 --> 00:29:50.374]  Well, those are fake cars if they have identified you and their Grayball program.
[00:29:51.115 --> 00:29:57.617]  Some of these people who are local officials did not know that the digital cars they saw on the app did not represent actual vehicles.
[00:29:58.277 --> 00:30:05.479]  Uber drivers were also then told on the other end, they told the human drivers who are still driving the Uber cars, don't pick these people up, they cancel it out.
[00:30:05.839 --> 00:30:06.680]  How did they do this?
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:13.982]  And this is interesting because this tells you how they're going to take action against people they don't like in the system, just as they're doing on social media now.
[00:30:14.912 --> 00:30:19.934]  They're putting fences around our content, they're putting fences around your content if you tried to share our information.
[00:30:20.294 --> 00:30:29.777]  They put, this is what Uber did, they put a geofence, a digital perimeter around certain areas, government offices on a digital map of the city that Uber was monitoring.
[00:30:29.817 --> 00:30:36.480]  They watched what people were going in and out and opening those apps in those areas.
[00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:38.580]  They eyeballed it, in other words.
[00:30:39.041 --> 00:30:42.922]  They say this is known internally by Uber as eyeballing those locations.
[00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:46.371]  And then decide those people be affiliated with city agencies.
[00:30:46.791 --> 00:30:46.951]  See?
[00:30:47.432 --> 00:30:50.373]  That's what they're going to do to you if they don't like you.
[00:30:51.153 --> 00:30:57.275]  You won't even be able to rent their cars because they'll put a geofence around people that they want to shut down.
[00:30:57.415 --> 00:31:01.237]  That's what the cashless, driverless future is all about.
[00:31:01.897 --> 00:31:04.238]  It's putting a geofence around you in particular.
[00:31:04.558 --> 00:31:05.599]  That's what you need to understand.
[00:31:05.659 --> 00:31:08.800]  This is not a technological problem that needs to be solved.
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:17.926]  This is a legal, political, human rights issue that is coming at us very hard, and we need to understand what the end game is on this.
[00:31:18.646 --> 00:31:23.130]  Understand they do not want to change and fix your infrastructure.
[00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:25.051]  They keep moving people into cities here in Austin.
[00:31:25.491 --> 00:31:29.234]  We have, I think, 50 people a day moving into Austin, but they're not making the roads any bigger.
[00:31:29.274 --> 00:31:31.395]  As a matter of fact, we look at Omaha, Nebraska, what are they doing?
[00:31:31.676 --> 00:31:36.099]  They're ripping up asphalt roads they say they don't want to repave and turning them into gravel.
[00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:41.191]  They do not want to maintain, fix, or expand our infrastructure.
[00:31:41.271 --> 00:31:43.851]  They want to keep you in their cities.
[00:31:44.412 --> 00:31:45.612]  And here's the other aspect of this.
[00:31:45.652 --> 00:31:48.312]  We look at this other Road and Track article.
[00:31:49.253 --> 00:31:56.534]  They talk about navigation systems that are actually making your brains duller, as they put it, but also smaller.
[00:31:56.674 --> 00:31:59.455]  This is a study, and I listened to this audio book.
[00:32:00.267 --> 00:32:03.388]  When I was on vacation by Stephen Fry, where he's talking about doing the knowledge.
[00:32:04.008 --> 00:32:14.971]  Doing the knowledge is what the London taxi drivers do when they learn all this incredibly complex number of streets that they have in London that have grown up over the centuries and they have to memorize where all these locations are.
[00:32:15.331 --> 00:32:16.491]  They call that doing the knowledge.
[00:32:16.591 --> 00:32:21.433]  They notice that when people did that, that their brains, their hippocampus particularly,
[00:32:23.735 --> 00:32:24.896]  Now they've seen the converse.
[00:32:25.256 --> 00:32:27.297]  You rely on your computer for directions.
[00:32:27.797 --> 00:32:32.458]  They see that the brain activity decreases and the hippocampus actually shrinks.
[00:32:33.179 --> 00:32:41.762]  Good example of this, the dependency, the mindless dependency on these computers is the article from a couple weeks ago.
[00:32:42.422 --> 00:32:49.344]  We had the lady who was stuck for five days and nearly died because she got stranded following her GPS directions and it didn't know where it was.
[00:32:49.524 --> 00:32:50.665]  Or the one that happened just in 2015.
[00:32:52.435 --> 00:33:01.624]  Where a man, 64 year old man, drove off a 37 foot plunge off of a bridge because he was told to by his GPS and his wife died.
[00:33:06.508 --> 00:33:16.057]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:33:17.022 --> 00:33:18.903]  That's why I get questions all the time over the years.
[00:33:18.923 --> 00:33:23.025]  Why don't you sell body armor at infowarestore.com?
[00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:25.726]  Or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:26.746]  And it's simple.
[00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:32.429]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:33.930]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.791]  There's quality versus price.
[00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:38.732]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:33:39.332 --> 00:33:44.775]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor,
[00:33:45.595 --> 00:33:52.304]  has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people.
[00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:55.913]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:33:56.653 --> 00:34:03.715]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:34:04.415 --> 00:34:07.216]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:09.657]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:13.678]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:14.919]  Well, believe me,
[00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:18.677]  This is Disruptive to Tyrants Worldwide.
[00:34:19.297 --> 00:34:30.319]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:31.959]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:34.099]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.761]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:34:42.541 --> 00:34:44.882]  We've, uh, went out and did some testing.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:47.663]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:34:47.683 --> 00:34:54.166]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, um, could be so strong.
[00:34:54.386 --> 00:35:07.672]  So what we did is we went out, we used, um, different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:35:08.052 --> 00:35:08.872]  Born in Texas.
[00:35:09.213 --> 00:35:10.173]  Made in America.
[00:35:10.373 --> 00:35:13.015]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:13.875]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:13.935 --> 00:35:14.875]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:35:15.236 --> 00:35:16.576]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:17.237]  It's waterproof.
[00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:17.737]  You can wear it.
[00:35:17.777 --> 00:35:18.337]  It's comfortable.
[00:35:18.397 --> 00:35:19.218]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:35:19.238 --> 00:35:21.539]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:29.623]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:35:30.323 --> 00:35:33.986]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:40.712]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:35:40.732 --> 00:35:42.094]  What did they really say about it?
[00:35:42.194 --> 00:35:43.214]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:46.177]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:54.865]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're weighing, they're wearing these big heavy bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:35:55.425 --> 00:36:00.429]  So, they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:07.954]  And 90, I mean, you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in a commission of crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:36:07.974 --> 00:36:09.636]  This stops that, unless it's a slug.
[00:36:09.656 --> 00:36:10.796]  I mean, that's amazing.
[00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:14.059]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[00:36:14.319 --> 00:36:20.183]  And soon, and we'll have it, if it's available to civilians, they're not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[00:36:20.504 --> 00:36:24.486]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:28.689]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:36:28.709 --> 00:36:29.469]  People didn't believe it.
[00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:30.810]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.611]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:36:33.932 --> 00:36:36.033]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:36:36.974 --> 00:36:41.156]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:48.435]  Again, fund the Info War, get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:36:48.835 --> 00:36:50.856]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:50.876 --> 00:36:50.856]  $200.
[00:36:51.456 --> 00:36:54.397]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:36:54.477 --> 00:36:55.178]  It's amazing.
[00:37:06.112 --> 00:37:09.734]  Are we in the process of a global consciousness transformation?
[00:37:09.954 --> 00:37:18.700]  And if so, what does the state of the environment or the recent election of President Trump say from a psycho-spiritual perspective?
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:24.804]  Now my guest today is going to talk to us about that and so much more, best-selling author and philosopher Daniel Pinchbeck.
[00:37:25.184 --> 00:37:31.088]  You are here on the book tour with your most recent book, How Soon Is Now, released in February 2017.
[00:37:33.389 --> 00:37:45.657]  You've also authored Breaking Open the Head, 2012, The Return of Quetzalcoatl, and your articles have appeared in a lot of publications, New York Times, Esquire, Rolling Stone, Wired, Artforum.
[00:37:46.297 --> 00:37:49.539]  You're the co-founder of the company Evolver.net.
[00:37:49.579 --> 00:37:51.881]  You published the web magazine Reality Sandwich.
[00:37:52.581 --> 00:38:01.810]  You've been featured in documentaries, 2012, Time for Change, and you also hosted the talk show Mindshift for Gaia TV, so you've been around a lot.
[00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:05.773]  I'm very familiar with your work and welcome, really happy to have you in studio.
[00:38:05.793 --> 00:38:07.815]  Thank you so much for having me.
[00:38:07.975 --> 00:38:13.480]  This new book, so the book is, tell us about what you see, you know, as this ecological crisis.
[00:38:13.501 --> 00:38:15.943]  You're saying we need to look at it as a rite of passage.
[00:38:16.263 --> 00:38:16.423]  Yeah.
[00:38:16.743 --> 00:38:28.469]  Well, a lot of my earlier work, my first book was about psychedelic shamanism and I visited indigenous cultures in West Africa and the Amazon in Mexico and went through different initiations using substances like ayahuasca and iboga.
[00:38:28.489 --> 00:38:38.914]  And as a result of that work, I began to realize that there are these rites of passage or initiation ceremonies in these traditional cultures around the planet, but our modern society doesn't have them anymore.
[00:38:39.654 --> 00:38:52.857]  And in a way, I feel that since we don't have them, we're almost like subconsciously pushing ourselves to bring about maybe a cathartic episode of disaster or crisis, to bring about a kind of evolution of consciousness.
[00:38:53.377 --> 00:39:01.099]  And in a way, I think that what we're looking at with the ecological crisis, which is this kind of multi-dimensional phenomenon, is that crisis that we're creating.
[00:39:01.119 --> 00:39:02.179]  But I think it's important for us
[00:39:02.799 --> 00:39:18.839]  To become aware of what we're doing and then also think about if we were to take on this initiation, you know, psychological crisis as a rite of passage, what would we, what kind of society would we want to create if we were to become more mature and responsible and compassionate, you know, for the web of life on the planet?
[00:39:19.215 --> 00:39:19.415]  Right.
[00:39:19.936 --> 00:39:29.726]  And so you're saying that we're kind of going through some archetypal turnover here, where we're all sort of taking the hero's journey, I guess, if you're familiar with that.
[00:39:30.526 --> 00:39:32.628]  Talk a little bit about this recent election.
[00:39:32.668 --> 00:39:36.252]  Obviously, we're all sort of feeling this pivotal change.
[00:39:36.272 --> 00:39:40.777]  I mean, frankly, I voted for President Trump with the intention of saying, let's just
[00:39:41.277 --> 00:39:42.238]  Burn the house down!
[00:39:42.559 --> 00:39:49.287]  Let's just see what happens because, in my opinion, voting in Hillary Clinton would have just been bringing in the same old same.
[00:39:49.448 --> 00:39:58.379]  So, you know, however you feel about the candidates that we were given, a lot of people feel like, let's just, we need to evoke this change.
[00:39:58.679 --> 00:39:59.179]  Sure, yeah.
[00:39:59.219 --> 00:40:17.165]  I mean, I certainly wouldn't have personally been able to vote for Donald Trump, but I understand that people felt very frustrated and angry because here you get this one chance to be a citizen in our democracy every four years, and you're given a choice between two horrible candidates who both are clearly compromised and corrupt.
[00:40:17.665 --> 00:40:20.346]  And I guess one of the things that I argue in the book is that
[00:40:21.366 --> 00:40:29.990]  Maybe we actually need a deeper transition in our government, our political and economic system towards something that would be more truly democratic.
[00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:36.653]  I mean, if you think about, in a way, the government we have now is like antiquated social technology, like it was developed in the 18th century.
[00:40:37.233 --> 00:40:45.138]  When information only moved at like horse and buggy speed and now we have the internets, everybody is, you know, connected continuously.
[00:40:45.638 --> 00:40:54.864]  Wouldn't it be amazing if there was a way we could all like learn and vote together continuously if the information was clear and the debates were honest and so on?
[00:40:55.224 --> 00:41:00.928]  You know, and I look at different platforms, like one that is from the Argentina called Democracy OS.
[00:41:01.648 --> 00:41:02.169]  We're good to go.
[00:41:20.206 --> 00:41:22.547]  It's clear that he's very compromised by Wall Street.
[00:41:22.607 --> 00:41:25.528]  His Treasury Secretary is from Goldman Sachs.
[00:41:25.608 --> 00:41:27.869]  Exxon is the Secretary of State now.
[00:41:27.989 --> 00:41:34.191]  So we basically voted in another version of the corporateocracy, just with a different kind of angle in a way.
[00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:45.254]  So now coming from your perspective and speaking about Trump and I guess he's about to sign some executive orders repealing some of the regulations that Obama put in as well with the EPA.
[00:41:45.274 --> 00:41:56.239]  A lot of people you know watching our show kind of appreciate the fact that Donald Trump appears to be someone who's going to be knocking out these three legs of globalism with the
[00:41:56.619 --> 00:42:10.411]  Open borders and global governance and the Agenda 21, which a lot of people feel, yeah, sure, maybe some of the science with climate change they can agree with, but it's the rules and the regulations, the implementation of that.
[00:42:10.491 --> 00:42:12.292]  They are going to harm the middle class.
[00:42:13.013 --> 00:42:16.756]  The EPA, the UN, they're highly politicized at this point.
[00:42:16.816 --> 00:42:20.499]  It's not even about saving the planet, frankly.
[00:42:20.539 --> 00:42:23.562]  It's very much an empire building bureaucracy.
[00:42:24.502 --> 00:42:39.578]  Yeah, I mean, I probably have, you know, sharp differences of opinion from a lot of people who watch this show, but I believe that we need to become mature enough, you know, as a community, as a society, so that we can really explore subjects carefully and parse them, you know, precisely.
[00:42:40.058 --> 00:42:45.861]  I mean, from the large amount of research that I did for the book, I do believe that climate change is a reality.
[00:42:45.881 --> 00:42:53.765]  I actually think that we are approaching a potential for ecological collapse, you know, and it's not just because of global warming.
[00:42:53.805 --> 00:42:55.346]  There's species extinction.
[00:42:55.386 --> 00:42:57.687]  We're losing 150 to 200 species a day.
[00:42:57.707 --> 00:43:04.391]  We know there's a little more than 8 million species on the planet, so we're losing 10% of the Earth's biodiversity every 10 to 15 years.
[00:43:04.871 --> 00:43:08.073]  And we've also learned how meshed together the web of life is on the planet.
[00:43:08.573 --> 00:43:17.658]  The oceans are 30% more acidic than they were 40 years ago, and that's because they're absorbing a lot of the excess industrial CO2, something like 60% or more of it.
[00:43:17.958 --> 00:43:23.961]  So we know, and that's leading to the breakdown of the coral reefs, which hold the biodiversity of the oceans together.
[00:43:23.981 --> 00:43:31.985]  And we know if these processes continue, like we've seen from past epochs, that it could lead to the extinction of large mammals such as ourselves.
[00:43:32.025 --> 00:43:33.466]  So we actually are at a critical threshold.
[00:43:33.886 --> 00:43:40.571]  Now, it's true that under the neoliberal regime of Clinton and Obama, this wasn't being attended to properly.
[00:43:40.591 --> 00:43:49.278]  I mean, if you look at Hillary Clinton, she was supporting fracking, she was making deals with the extractive industries, and clearly, you know, they're taking the brakes off of everything right now.
[00:43:49.739 --> 00:44:02.589]  You know, that I don't think is a good idea, but it's going to require some other approach, and it may even require some levels of breakdown before people just admit that what's happening is really happening.
[00:44:03.274 --> 00:44:11.503]  Right, and obviously we can argue for hours and days, weeks, months about climate change, just kind of the science behind it.
[00:44:12.924 --> 00:44:18.590]  We've reported on just some global warming scams and then the science, frankly, is compromised in a lot of cases.
[00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:22.835]  The UN might shut you down entirely if you have a countering opinion, but
[00:44:24.216 --> 00:44:26.418]  No one can deny that climate change is happening.
[00:44:26.458 --> 00:44:27.399]  It's always happened.
[00:44:27.539 --> 00:44:30.021]  It's a multidimensional ecological crisis.
[00:44:30.162 --> 00:44:33.405]  Well, these extinction events have happened all throughout our history.
[00:44:33.665 --> 00:44:36.327]  CO2 levels were much higher in the past.
[00:44:36.367 --> 00:44:45.576]  So the perspective of how soon is now is that we're in a very critical time period and we actually need to kind of have a collective awakening and shift
[00:44:46.096 --> 00:44:54.759]  Both our technical systems, like how we're doing farming, for instance, industrial agriculture is very negative to the planet and reduces, depletes topsoil and so on.
[00:44:54.779 --> 00:44:59.421]  So we need to have different forms of agriculture, no-till, regenerative permaculture.
[00:44:59.981 --> 00:45:06.204]  We need to shift to renewable energy in a short timeframe, not over 70 or 100 years, but maybe over 10 or 20 years, which we could do.
[00:45:06.784 --> 00:45:06.985]  We're good.
[00:45:22.725 --> 00:45:23.486]  Thank you so much.
[00:45:44.884 --> 00:46:00.600]  Okay well stick around because I know we're running out of time and I really want to get your perspective kind of it's a it's a very broad subject but I really would like to get the perspective on regardless of of climate change and where you stand on that coming from a consciousness level how we think you know
[00:46:02.202 --> 00:46:06.165]  Our sort of shadow side is expressing itself in the outer realm.
[00:46:06.866 --> 00:46:10.629]  You know, you can look at the macrocosm and the microcosm.
[00:46:10.889 --> 00:46:12.290]  We are all related.
[00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:13.391]  We all affect each other.
[00:46:13.451 --> 00:46:14.072]  So stick around.
[00:46:14.092 --> 00:46:16.754]  We're going to have the rest of this interview right after the break.
[00:46:35.615 --> 00:46:37.176]  And all you ISIS people threatening us?
[00:46:37.416 --> 00:46:38.877]  Hey, we're not a French newspaper.
[00:46:39.377 --> 00:46:39.597]  Okay?
[00:46:39.897 --> 00:46:42.758]  We got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now.
[00:46:42.959 --> 00:46:44.659]  We're armed to the teeth, and we're not scared.
[00:46:44.679 --> 00:46:45.980]  You got that, you sons of bitches?
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:47.021]  This is Texas.
[00:46:47.241 --> 00:46:48.061]  You wanna threaten me?
[00:46:48.121 --> 00:46:49.242]  You can go straight to hell.
[00:46:49.282 --> 00:46:49.922]  You understand that?
[00:46:50.082 --> 00:46:55.805]  Never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 Proof.
[00:46:56.265 --> 00:47:00.067]  It's the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:47:02.975 --> 00:47:07.758]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.418 --> 00:47:10.019]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.399 --> 00:47:15.402]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.762 --> 00:47:21.206]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.606 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.412]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.432 --> 00:48:49.473]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.813 --> 00:48:50.493]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.553 --> 00:48:51.153]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.513 --> 00:48:59.056]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.076 --> 00:48:59.957]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.977 --> 00:49:00.017]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:07.125 --> 00:49:08.187]  Okay, and welcome back.
[00:49:08.247 --> 00:49:14.596]  My guest today is author and philosopher Daniel Pinchback, and we are speaking about his new book, How Soon Is Now?
[00:49:15.076 --> 00:49:21.445]  And before the break, we were talking a little bit about the initiation process that we would see in
[00:49:23.608 --> 00:49:27.251]  More ancient societies ancient cultures, but we don't really experience that here in the West.
[00:49:27.771 --> 00:49:42.341]  We have really Pushed aside our intuition and our intuitive selves in favor of a more left-brain logical world and People would say the the patriarchy where we've pushed the the divine feminine to the side.
[00:49:42.681 --> 00:49:44.782]  So we're very askew We're very off balance.
[00:49:45.203 --> 00:49:53.168]  So I would love to kind of touch on that how how in a from a consciousness perspective How could that be affecting our world around us?
[00:49:53.548 --> 00:49:54.849]  Yeah, I'm really happy that you bring that up.
[00:49:54.869 --> 00:49:55.750]  I totally agree with you.
[00:49:55.790 --> 00:50:07.558]  I mean, you know, one thing is like, you know, because we've had such a kind of negative bias against like indigenous people and tribal societies, you know, we've kind of just assumed that initiations don't really mean anything.
[00:50:08.039 --> 00:50:22.129]  But actually, there's research that suggests they don't not only have a cultural function, even like a neurobiological function that maybe that the part of our brain that makes us most distinctly human only developed in the last hundred thousand years to its full capacity, which is like the prefrontal cortex.
[00:50:22.789 --> 00:50:26.451]  That's how we can use language and plan for the future and process abstract symbols.
[00:50:26.951 --> 00:50:32.033]  But it also kind of locks us in this kind of limited self-identity, like an ego-based identity.
[00:50:32.053 --> 00:50:35.694]  And that's really where most people today are kind of acting out of in our society.
[00:50:36.094 --> 00:50:44.978]  And the fact is that if you go through these, for tribal people, you really couldn't be an adult until you've gone through this type of initiation and had visionary or transpersonal experiences.
[00:50:45.518 --> 00:50:54.342]  And then you would understand that, yeah, that you were connected to this cosmic whole, this larger unity, and you would be able to take responsibility for the community as a whole.
[00:50:54.362 --> 00:51:03.706]  So when I look at somebody like Donald Trump, for instance, and his history of just being very self-interested and sort of narcissistic, like he's like, you know, you can say like a kidult.
[00:51:04.166 --> 00:51:14.711]  And in that way, he's a shadow projection, collectively, of all of us being trapped in this immature state where we're not really doing those things that we really do need to do at this point to take care of the
[00:51:15.111 --> 00:51:19.814]  Increasingly fragile situation on the planet that we've created sort of heedlessly.
[00:51:20.995 --> 00:51:24.317]  And so how do we, how do we, what are the solutions?
[00:51:24.437 --> 00:51:32.742]  Because I completely disagree with the carbon tax and taxing you and I on our gas and everything.
[00:51:33.582 --> 00:51:39.886]  They really pushed these green initiatives for instance, but they were so successful that now they're taxing people who
[00:51:42.188 --> 00:51:44.309]  They're saying, well, you're not allowed to be off the grid.
[00:51:44.349 --> 00:51:45.649]  You need to pay into the system.
[00:51:45.749 --> 00:51:55.174]  Or if you have a car that goes on energy rather than gas, then they're taxing you by the mile for how much you drive.
[00:51:55.234 --> 00:51:58.415]  So these solar panels, it's too effective.
[00:51:58.515 --> 00:52:08.180]  If truly we were at this cataclysmic event in our history, man-made, and they were really concerned about us, wouldn't they be pushing that to the side and saying, look, we need to make some
[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:11.801]  Some real change here and we're willing to forego our pockets.
[00:52:12.441 --> 00:52:19.303]  Well, I mean, I guess I kind of question the they in a way, like if there's a model, you know, monomaniacal or monolithic they.
[00:52:19.323 --> 00:52:25.005]  I think there are many different factors and there's a huge amount of money still being made in the extractive industries.
[00:52:25.065 --> 00:52:32.888]  I mean, you know, some people believe that if we take all the oil, you know, out of the Arctic and so on, the planet will overheat.
[00:52:33.288 --> 00:52:35.649]  And so that actually what we should be doing is saying that
[00:52:36.109 --> 00:52:45.033]  Like $50 trillion worth of the energy companies, fossil fuel companies, resources are actually stranded assets that should be taken off the books because they have to stay in the ground.
[00:52:45.453 --> 00:52:56.498]  And we also have to remember that these companies are very skillful and they potentially put hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars into disinformation that has shaped public opinion around climate change.
[00:52:56.958 --> 00:52:59.920]  The same way the cigarette companies did with tobacco for many years.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:08.024]  As I said, from my research, I think it's quite obvious that climate change is happening, and it's certainly largely human caused, if not entirely.
[00:53:08.084 --> 00:53:17.710]  I mean, I know that that's, as I said, a contentious point, but we know there are more than 400 parts per million carbon dioxide in the atmosphere now, and we know that a stable climate was 275 parts per million.
[00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:22.473]  We know the last time there was this much CO2 in the atmosphere, which is a measurable kind of sheath,
[00:53:23.253 --> 00:53:26.817]  You know, temperatures were four degrees Celsius warmer and sea levels were a hundred feet higher.
[00:53:26.837 --> 00:53:37.086]  You know, so that's kind of where we're heading unless we were to say, okay, like we take responsibility for this and we would have to curtail, you know, kind of our use of resources.
[00:53:37.626 --> 00:53:42.491]  But we would have to do that through some type of social kind of collaborative process.
[00:53:42.591 --> 00:53:46.955]  Like for instance, we could maybe agree that the, as you said, off the grid communities,
[00:53:47.635 --> 00:53:53.036]  Based on renewables, where people are growing their own food, maybe a type of basic income or basic subsidy.
[00:53:53.076 --> 00:53:54.797]  I mean, one way that Trump won the election.
[00:53:54.837 --> 00:53:59.258]  Well, this basically sounds like communism that has failed over and over again, though.
[00:53:59.358 --> 00:54:15.041]  The system of communism, which is what a lot of people are afraid of, that they're really trying to shove down people's throat, which is, sure, you guys are going to have a basic income and everyone will be equal, but it's really a system which will prop up an elite few while the rest of us will just
[00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:17.380]  I mean, we're already in a system.
[00:54:17.401 --> 00:54:18.781]  I mean, how could it get any worse?
[00:54:18.801 --> 00:54:20.022]  We're in a system that has propped up.
[00:54:20.042 --> 00:54:24.824]  I mean, it's estimated that 65 people control more wealth than half the world's population.
[00:54:25.344 --> 00:54:27.405]  Trump appointed 17 cabinet members.
[00:54:27.445 --> 00:54:31.507]  Their combined wealth was more than 100 million, one third of the American population.
[00:54:31.867 --> 00:54:36.929]  So we already have this incredible concentration of wealth, which is very unfair, because if you actually really think about it,
[00:54:37.349 --> 00:54:51.113]  There's no reason that somebody who say trades shares on a computer all day or manipulates the currencies of third world countries should make more than somebody who's you know working in a truck stop or taking care of children or elderly people in a nursing home.
[00:54:51.493 --> 00:54:55.954]  It's just the values that we ascribe to these activities and I think we need to really think about
[00:54:56.454 --> 00:55:00.155]  What values matter and how we go forward as a society, you know?
[00:55:00.215 --> 00:55:05.036]  So, so yeah, I mean, I think that we do need to reduce wealth inequality substantially.
[00:55:05.056 --> 00:55:13.358]  We do need to move towards autonomous, decentralized communities that are more participatory, where people can have great information and make their own decisions.
[00:55:13.898 --> 00:55:17.459]  Some type of basic income or way that people can support themselves.
[00:55:17.919 --> 00:55:25.344]  And also, as the ecological crisis deepens, we're going to need more resilience, like more self-sufficiency is going to be necessary for communities to survive.
[00:55:25.885 --> 00:55:28.547]  And then, you know, but also automation is a good thing.
[00:55:28.567 --> 00:55:35.572]  I mean, Trump, one way that Trump won the election was by arguing that he was going to bring back the golden age of industrialization.
[00:55:36.112 --> 00:55:41.975]  But actually, we're seeing more and more high-tech, you know, so we're not going to see more jobs through industrialization.
[00:55:42.015 --> 00:55:44.096]  We're going to see more, probably, high-tech automation.
[00:55:44.156 --> 00:55:50.579]  That could be a great thing, you know, as I argue in the book, looking even at thinkers like Oscar Wilde who talked about it.
[00:55:50.619 --> 00:55:57.802]  Like, automation could liberate people to have more time to take care of their families, to learn, to love each other, and so on.
[00:55:57.842 --> 00:56:03.565]  Like, we could actually scale down the amount of work people do as a social mission.
[00:56:04.005 --> 00:56:09.187]  You know, while we're creating the basis of a more decentralized and humane society.
[00:56:09.407 --> 00:56:09.627]  Right.
[00:56:09.727 --> 00:56:17.210]  Well, and also it's kind of like detaching ourselves from that need to compete rather than cooperate.
[00:56:18.330 --> 00:56:23.812]  Obviously, if everyone could work together all over the planet as kind of a human race, I feel like we could achieve so much.
[00:56:23.992 --> 00:56:25.913]  They look at the space program as a perfect example.
[00:56:25.993 --> 00:56:26.414]  Exactly.
[00:56:26.434 --> 00:56:38.286]  And that's like one of the basic ideas of the book is like, in a way, if we were to think about it from outside and look at humanity, we're like a giant planetary organism, like a super organism that's in a symbiotic relationship with the ecology of the Earth as a whole system.
[00:56:38.746 --> 00:56:44.632]  And if we think about it in those terms, we begin to think about, okay, if we're like a giant body, then we should be sharing resources efficiently.
[00:56:44.672 --> 00:56:49.317]  It shouldn't be like, you know, just held by these tiny pockets of power and so on.
[00:56:49.857 --> 00:56:51.518]  Yeah, I mean I can't disagree with you there.
[00:56:51.539 --> 00:57:11.473]  I did a long report on the Henry Kissinger's NSSM Memorandum 200 where he specifically outlines how you have to keep third world countries kind of controlled and control the population and then extract their resources and bring it over to, you know, the people who are controlling all of those resources.
[00:57:11.513 --> 00:57:15.136]  So it's definitely skewed in an unfavorable way.
[00:57:15.216 --> 00:57:17.518]  I just think a lot of people are also very concerned with
[00:57:17.978 --> 00:57:22.840]  Becoming globally governed by the people who are currently in power.
[00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:31.444]  I mean, they've kind of... Well, and as you said, that's why we seem to be pushing towards some type of cathartic crisis, which maybe will allow us to reconfigure.
[00:57:31.844 --> 00:57:33.325]  Like, maybe we need a deeper transition.
[00:57:33.365 --> 00:57:36.066]  Maybe it's not going to be Democrats and Republicans.
[00:57:36.126 --> 00:57:46.751]  Maybe we're going to, you know, come use the Internet to create a truly open source and participatory decision making system for all of humanity to be involved with the decisions that matter.
[00:57:47.051 --> 00:57:58.300]  Yeah, I know you've mentioned before the blockchain code, which we see with Bitcoin, something like that, which could be used to help with the voting or keep things kind of free and open.
[00:57:58.540 --> 00:58:00.302]  Yeah, or other ways that we could exchange value.
[00:58:00.322 --> 00:58:04.865]  Like friends of mine created a platform, TimeRepublic, with a K, which is a timeshare system.
[00:58:04.885 --> 00:58:09.409]  So rather than exchanging dollars, you can exchange hours, you know, to share do tasks.
[00:58:09.429 --> 00:58:16.475]  That's just one of many types of innovations that we could have that would allow people to be in a more equitable relationship with each other.
[00:58:17.145 --> 00:58:19.866]  Well Daniel, thank you so much for being in studio with us today.
[00:58:19.926 --> 00:58:22.007]  The book is How Soon Is Now.

[00:58:27.889 --> 00:58:30.950]  There's an introduction by Russell Brand, a preface by Sting.
[00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:33.671]  A lot of people saying that this is a very important book.
[00:58:33.711 --> 00:58:35.111]  You need to get this now.
[00:58:35.571 --> 00:58:38.412]  This is going to propose a blueprint for the future.
[00:58:38.452 --> 00:58:43.234]  We can redesign our whole society via political, technical, social,
[00:58:43.474 --> 00:58:44.335]  I hope people check it out.
[00:58:44.375 --> 00:58:47.319]  Even if they don't agree with all my ideas, it's good to have another perspective.
[00:58:47.539 --> 00:58:48.300]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:51.624]  And you've had a very great perspective for years, so I highly recommend it.
