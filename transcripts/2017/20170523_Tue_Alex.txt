[00:00:11.454 --> 00:00:27.038]  From the InfoWars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting worldwide, you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic technocracy takeover.
[00:00:28.358 --> 00:00:30.439]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.231 --> 00:00:35.212]  The suicide bomber's been identified.
[00:00:35.232 --> 00:00:39.014]  His handiwork, Salman Abadi, 23.
[00:00:40.735 --> 00:00:43.236]  Tens of thousands of jihadists have floored into Europe.
[00:00:43.937 --> 00:00:49.460]  Here's some of their handiwork last night, when the country that welcomed him with open arms was attacked.
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.521]  Oh my God.
[00:00:52.221 --> 00:00:54.563]  What just happened?
[00:01:04.136 --> 00:01:04.957]  What's going on?
[00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:09.320]  Oh my God!
[00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:27.153]  Broken line Driving man
[00:01:34.056 --> 00:01:34.336]  No!
[00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:42.503]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are five million people plus that have been brought into Europe in the last four years.
[00:01:42.943 --> 00:01:45.185]  Eighty percent of our military age men, according to Interpol.
[00:01:46.766 --> 00:02:02.097]  The United Nations ran a public program to recruit jihadists from the Arab Spring, from Africa, the Middle East, from Eastern Europe, from places like Chechnya, to come to Germany, France, Belgium,
[00:02:03.354 --> 00:02:06.937]  Sweden, the UK, Canada, the United States.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.442]  And they have pledged allegiance to ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[00:02:13.122 --> 00:02:15.404]  They have pledged allegiance to attack our countries.
[00:02:16.946 --> 00:02:27.595]  And then every time there's an attack, which you're intensifying all the time, with the shootings, the truck attacks, the bombings, the media comes out, and I've got articles on Infowars.com,
[00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.143]  And blames conservatism and says that Islamophobia is what is making these people attack us.
[00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:50.175]  That story is up on Infowars.com, where the left was very, very quick to come out and bemoan Islamophobia backlash on social media following Manchester terror attack.
[00:02:50.455 --> 00:03:02.140]  So not only is the left and these globalist systems we have to blame for bringing in these vipers, on top of it they blame those of us that have warned of it and say it's our fault!
[00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:08.963]  And then a bunch of well-meaning teenagers, some of them children,
[00:03:10.538 --> 00:03:13.100]  I don't know why you let your kids go to a rock concert when they're 8 years old.
[00:03:14.061 --> 00:03:14.762]  Get attacked!
[00:03:15.383 --> 00:03:35.042]  And I point out, it's liberal, wide-open UK, and the liberal policies that are to blame for that, in the aggregate, on average, more than half the Brits, are the liberal trendies that would walk off a plank, who would jump off of a cliff, who would slip their own wrist, cut their own heads off, if they were told it was trendy.
[00:03:36.653 --> 00:03:38.815]  And it's so sad to see mass Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:03:38.875 --> 00:03:40.797]  I don't blame the victims.
[00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:54.389]  I blame the culture, the brainwashing, the globalists for turning people into cult members who will go along with religions and systems that are diametrically opposed to their own supposed beliefs.
[00:03:59.133 --> 00:04:01.415]  It's sick, but then Media Matters David Brock comes out.
[00:04:01.595 --> 00:04:02.356]  Because what do you do?
[00:04:03.581 --> 00:04:16.448]  What do you do when you push this agenda of open borders and bringing in the islamicists and they keep raping people and they keep, you know, killing people and they're, uh, fit the bill for being the rape-ugees that we call them.
[00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:18.069]  What do you do?
[00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.372]  You turn it around and you say, oh no, it's the right winger's fault.
[00:04:23.217 --> 00:04:24.398]  It's Alex Jones' fault.
[00:04:25.158 --> 00:04:29.281]  He stirred up the Muslims, or he blames the children that got blown up.
[00:04:29.541 --> 00:04:37.485]  No, I blame the parents, and I blame the liberals, and I blame anyone who called for open borders to bring these rattlesnakes in.
[00:04:37.686 --> 00:04:41.668]  If I bring a rattlesnake in and stick it under your bed and it bites you, it's my fault.
[00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:47.351]  But if you know I've stuck a rattlesnake in there and you go along with it as well, you become part of it as well.
[00:04:48.272 --> 00:04:50.053]  That's just common sense logic.
[00:04:51.337 --> 00:04:52.578]  They are the ones that are guilty.
[00:04:52.598 --> 00:04:53.678]  The people like media matters.
[00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:57.940]  Welcome to the Democrat Convention.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.460]  F*** Donald Trump.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.842]  That's right folks, here at the Democrat Party, we don't engage in policy.
[00:05:02.922 --> 00:05:04.242]  We don't engage in ideas.
[00:05:04.322 --> 00:05:05.443]  We don't have discussion.
[00:05:05.583 --> 00:05:08.484]  We just curse and cry and... Hey, what did that racist just say?
[00:05:08.504 --> 00:05:13.346]  Today's event is featuring the chrome dome cursing machine, Tom Perez.
[00:05:13.586 --> 00:05:14.966]  He's a f***ing liar.
[00:05:15.026 --> 00:05:17.447]  That's what I say, pal.
[00:05:17.467 --> 00:05:19.028]  You're f***ing right he's a liar.
[00:05:20.635 --> 00:05:28.746]  And now give it up for the lunatic fringe, Nancy Pelosi, and our esteemed colleague, John Burton, who will lead us in this f*** Donald Trump chant.
[00:05:28.766 --> 00:05:31.669]  Now all together, f*** Donald Trump!
[00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:34.473]  Shut the f*** up and go outside, alright?
[00:05:34.513 --> 00:05:35.835]  F*** Donald Trump!
[00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:51.808]  That's John Burton closing out the 2017 Democrat Senate event in California after he led the crowd chants of F Donald Trump while the audience raised their middle fingers in the air.
[00:05:51.989 --> 00:05:54.771]  This is Owen Troyer for InfoWars and the Dems have gone mental.
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:56.160]  Not a group.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.622]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:05:57.662 --> 00:05:58.743]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:05:59.003 --> 00:05:59.924]  Why is this so good?
[00:06:00.204 --> 00:06:05.448]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:06:05.528 --> 00:06:19.099]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:20.521]  Right now with all the refugees,
[00:06:21.421 --> 00:06:22.842]  Spreading disease around.
[00:06:22.942 --> 00:06:25.424]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[00:06:25.524 --> 00:06:26.785]  These are all parasites.
[00:06:26.845 --> 00:06:27.925]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[00:06:27.945 --> 00:06:28.986]  There's so many things that are in it.
[00:06:29.298 --> 00:06:33.622]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[00:06:33.822 --> 00:06:36.965]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[00:06:36.985 --> 00:06:40.168]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[00:06:40.208 --> 00:06:41.189]  It just came back in yesterday.
[00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:43.131]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:44.212]  And folks, you can't lose.

[00:08:05.094 --> 00:08:12.821]  Well, the leftists are blaming the right wing of the Alex Jones Show because there is a war on your mind.
[00:08:13.968 --> 00:08:17.691]  That's the headline with the tweets and the news article headlines at Infowars.com.
[00:08:18.111 --> 00:08:19.972]  Leftist bemoan Islamophobia.
[00:08:20.773 --> 00:08:30.139]  Backlash on social media following Manchester terrorist attack and basically blame Christians for stirring up the Muslims.
[00:08:30.539 --> 00:08:32.380]  We need to submit to their religion.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.981]  We need to put our women in hijabs.
[00:08:34.322 --> 00:08:43.628]  We need to have the feminist groups go out and scream Allah Akbar in the town squares all over the United States and all over Europe and that will make the Islamists to stop attacking us.
[00:08:45.429 --> 00:08:56.332]  All over the news they're asking who is the accomplice to the reported bomber that CBS News and Drudge Report and others are now reporting, Salman Abedi.
[00:08:56.773 --> 00:08:57.973]  Who are the accomplices?
[00:08:58.013 --> 00:08:58.633]  Let me tell you.
[00:08:59.073 --> 00:09:06.316]  The Democratic Party, the Labour Party of the UK, Merkel's party in Germany,
[00:09:08.237 --> 00:09:13.302]  People like Macron that says Islamic attacks are now part of life, just accept it.
[00:09:13.542 --> 00:09:19.708]  And the riots, and the rapes, and the car attacks, and the stabbings, and the shootings, and the no-go zones everywhere.
[00:09:20.188 --> 00:09:23.591]  And the mayor of London declaring it London-stan.
[00:09:24.992 --> 00:09:29.417]  And saying that it's now part of life, just accept terror.
[00:09:29.737 --> 00:09:31.679]  It's never called Islamist.
[00:09:33.484 --> 00:09:34.764]  That's who's aiding and abetting.
[00:09:34.784 --> 00:09:36.265]  They keep saying, who was helping him?
[00:09:36.345 --> 00:09:37.305]  How did he do it?
[00:09:38.006 --> 00:09:40.326]  They've brought back thousands and thousands.
[00:09:40.406 --> 00:09:50.030]  Just 1,600 the last few months have come back into Europe and back into the UK who were actual ISIS fighters and who were on a watch list.
[00:09:51.374 --> 00:10:01.603]  There are more than 4,000 total on ISIS watch lists just in the UK alone, and thousands more a month coming into Europe that Interpol allows in.
[00:10:02.003 --> 00:10:10.431]  They know they're ISIS fighters, they know they're Al-Qaeda, they know they're Wahhabis, and they let them back into the countries.
[00:10:12.045 --> 00:10:13.766]  So you ask, who's behind this?
[00:10:14.267 --> 00:10:18.429]  The UN, the globalists, the refugee programs, George Soros pushing it.
[00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:27.936]  The UN certifies it's safe to bring them in, does no background checks, lets in known ISIS fighters, orders our State Department to let them in.
[00:10:28.236 --> 00:10:29.737]  That's what we live under.
[00:10:29.957 --> 00:10:38.523]  And it's the same thing in the UK, where the EU orders the UK on who to let in, and if the UK doesn't let in ISIS fighters, they're fined up to £100,000.
[00:10:42.485 --> 00:10:43.666]  For refusing entry.
[00:10:43.926 --> 00:10:45.906]  And they're talking about charging more.
[00:10:46.107 --> 00:10:47.927]  They're talking about a million euros.
[00:10:48.027 --> 00:10:48.968]  Just type it into Google.
[00:10:49.868 --> 00:10:51.509]  If you don't, accept that.
[00:10:53.569 --> 00:11:03.933]  And so ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure many of the parents of the young people that were at this concert, many were adults, many were tweenies, many were teens, most adults probably there don't like having open borders to Islam.
[00:11:04.633 --> 00:11:08.855]  But I guarantee you a lot of the parents do want to go along with bringing in radical Islam.
[00:11:10.649 --> 00:11:17.711]  And bottom line, they are now responsible for this animal bombing and killing 22 plus people.
[00:11:18.032 --> 00:11:28.095]  The parents that call for open borders and call for appeasement are just as guilty as Macron and Merkel and Hillary Clinton and Obama and all the rest of them.
[00:11:28.355 --> 00:11:31.716]  You're the ones that have these dead children's blood on your hands.
[00:11:31.996 --> 00:11:33.497]  You're the trendies that love this.
[00:11:33.757 --> 00:11:38.258]  I was at the mall yesterday with my children and many of the shops I walked by like Gap.
[00:11:38.478 --> 00:11:39.839]  We have some footage we can roll in a minute.
[00:11:40.859 --> 00:11:43.963]  Show women in hijabs on their front billboards.
[00:11:44.444 --> 00:11:47.508]  The number one thing they're promoting is women in hijabs.
[00:11:49.711 --> 00:11:52.294]  It is absolutely being force-fed to us.
[00:11:52.334 --> 00:11:55.078]  Just a few months ago at the inauguration, I saw them handing out thousands.
[00:11:57.321 --> 00:11:59.342]  Of American flag hijabs to women.
[00:11:59.923 --> 00:12:00.683]  And I couldn't believe it.
[00:12:00.703 --> 00:12:04.505]  It turned out it was officially run by Muslims and George Soros funded it.
[00:12:05.226 --> 00:12:07.667]  And that it was an induction into Islam.
[00:12:08.367 --> 00:12:11.309]  And then we see it all over the news, USA Today, you name it.
[00:12:11.449 --> 00:12:17.513]  Women wearing the hijab, even if they're not Muslims, to stand against Trump.
[00:12:19.414 --> 00:12:21.815]  You just had the truck attack killing a bunch of people in Stockholm, Sweden.
[00:12:22.015 --> 00:12:23.676]  They wouldn't show the dead and dying people.
[00:12:24.236 --> 00:12:28.738]  They don't want to show you the dead teenagers and dead young people up close from Manchester.
[00:12:29.098 --> 00:12:30.439]  Close to where Paul Watson's from!
[00:12:32.375 --> 00:12:41.258]  And then they have the nerve at Media Matters, openly funded by George Soros, the Nazi collaborator, to come out and say, Alex Jones blames the victims.
[00:12:41.758 --> 00:12:45.339]  And then they have their own people quoted and they're saying, kill me, shoot me, murder me.
[00:12:45.819 --> 00:12:47.640]  Well, I guess your Islamicist will probably try.
[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:56.543]  And what I actually said was, upwards of half the population in Britain in polls, or more, want open borders and Muslims to be brought in.
[00:12:57.904 --> 00:13:01.330]  And so these are the people that are guilty of this.
[00:13:01.751 --> 00:13:10.107]  And you are guilty, if you promoted this, of aiding and abetting people that just went like cowards and bombed a bunch of innocent children.
[00:13:13.527 --> 00:13:31.660]  But see, an upside-down, bizarro world, you have to invert it and say, Conservatives and Libertarians and Nationalists and just common-sense people, we made the Muslims bad, we made them attack us, we have to appease them, we have to bow down to them, we have to go along with them better, and then everything would have been okay.
[00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:35.182]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us from London, England.
[00:13:35.883 --> 00:13:39.946]  We are then joined, ladies and gentlemen, at the bottom of the hour by
[00:13:41.058 --> 00:13:45.020]  Some of the other witnesses to what happened from the UK as well.
[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:50.042]  Paul Watson will then be hosting the fourth hour.
[00:13:52.102 --> 00:13:55.804]  And we have Tommy Robinson again, who's on the front lines of exposing this.
[00:13:56.044 --> 00:13:58.125]  He'll be joining us coming up in about 20 minutes.
[00:13:58.345 --> 00:13:59.946]  But Paul Watson joins us right now.
[00:13:59.966 --> 00:14:03.767]  And I'm going to play the clips of the mayor of London saying, just get used to it.
[00:14:05.008 --> 00:14:06.208]  Just get used to it, baby.
[00:14:06.548 --> 00:14:08.069]  You're going to get cucked and cucked hard.
[00:14:08.849 --> 00:14:09.709]  And it's not his fault, though.
[00:14:09.729 --> 00:14:10.209]  It's my fault!
[00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:13.190]  Media Matters doesn't say he shows any blame.
[00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:13.810]  It's me!
[00:14:14.471 --> 00:14:18.131]  George Soros, the Nazi collaborator, says it's my fault.
[00:14:18.252 --> 00:14:20.812]  It's your fault because you didn't bring in enough Muslims.
[00:14:21.032 --> 00:14:22.813]  You didn't cut enough genitals off women.
[00:14:23.033 --> 00:14:24.573]  You didn't put enough headdresses on them.
[00:14:24.793 --> 00:14:25.894]  You didn't bow down enough.
[00:14:25.954 --> 00:14:27.554]  You didn't give in enough.
[00:14:27.614 --> 00:14:28.894]  You didn't submit enough.
[00:14:31.275 --> 00:14:33.295]  You read the Media Matters, it's like, I'm sick of Christians.
[00:14:33.516 --> 00:14:34.656]  We got a Christian problem.
[00:14:35.686 --> 00:14:37.808]  In the comments, we're going to get this Christian Jones.
[00:14:38.068 --> 00:14:40.030]  I bet it's Muslims in there saying, kill me.
[00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:42.191]  We want to kill Jones.
[00:14:42.432 --> 00:14:43.572]  Yeah, let's kill him.
[00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:44.833]  Yeah, we're liberal.
[00:14:44.974 --> 00:14:45.674]  Let's kill him.
[00:14:45.714 --> 00:14:47.536]  It's his fault the Muslims killed people.
[00:14:47.756 --> 00:14:48.597]  It's Christians though.
[00:14:48.777 --> 00:14:49.597]  They're the bad ones.
[00:14:50.098 --> 00:14:50.758]  Well, don't worry.
[00:14:51.339 --> 00:14:54.241]  What's left of a Christian culture just got bombed yesterday.
[00:14:55.682 --> 00:14:58.645]  God, you're a group of foaming at the mouth mental patients.
[00:14:59.346 --> 00:15:05.547]  We have a real problem in this country and around the world, and I'm not afraid to call it by the name, Radical Christian Extremism.
[00:15:05.747 --> 00:15:07.988]  Well, let me give you statistics from your own UN, bud.
[00:15:08.008 --> 00:15:09.848]  They're at Media Matters.
[00:15:11.909 --> 00:15:18.710]  Christians are the number one persecuted group in the world, doubling everybody else, and that amount of attacks on Christians has doubled in the last decade.
[00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:19.970]  It's growing exponentially.
[00:15:20.531 --> 00:15:21.631]  And that's what Trump talked about.
[00:15:21.691 --> 00:15:25.031]  Now, let's go to Paul Joseph Watson from London, England.
[00:15:25.772 --> 00:15:27.112]  To break this down, we have
[00:15:29.007 --> 00:15:30.809]  22 dead, more than 50 injured.
[00:15:31.809 --> 00:15:33.511]  And the media is saying, why'd this happen?
[00:15:33.551 --> 00:15:34.731]  It's completely out of the blue.
[00:15:34.992 --> 00:15:37.674]  They tried to cover it up as an Islamic attack for 24 hours.
[00:15:38.014 --> 00:15:38.574]  It failed.
[00:15:38.874 --> 00:15:41.416]  Now the government of the UK has come out and said it is Islamic.
[00:15:41.757 --> 00:15:50.403]  The pitiful, slimy, disgusting, cowardly, out of control ISIS people have taken credit.
[00:15:50.903 --> 00:15:52.865]  And the answer is bring more Islamists to stand.
[00:15:53.025 --> 00:15:54.426]  And I'll say this, I don't blame all the police.
[00:15:55.543 --> 00:15:57.625]  Alex, the people to blame are the political class who have...
[00:16:11.283 --> 00:16:18.388]  Ranked in matter of importance, tolerance above the basic function of government, which is protecting the lives of its people.
[00:16:18.748 --> 00:16:22.951]  They think it's now more important to rank tolerance above that.
[00:16:23.291 --> 00:16:24.192]  What is tolerance?
[00:16:24.632 --> 00:16:35.499]  Tolerance of Muslim rape gangs that abduct young girls and abuse them for years and years and years, and the authorities don't do anything about it because it's politically incorrect.
[00:16:35.899 --> 00:16:36.800]  That's tolerance.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.081]  Tolerance of Sharia law.
[00:16:38.161 --> 00:16:40.663]  Tolerance of women being abused and harassed on the street.
[00:16:41.403 --> 00:16:44.226]  Tolerance is now more important than the basic right to life.
[00:16:44.687 --> 00:16:47.990]  You were talking about political correctness before, Alex.
[00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:52.815]  You know, with the San Bernardino killings, we saw the neighbours were getting suspicious.
[00:16:53.216 --> 00:16:56.019]  They were taking in these suspicious parcels before the attacks.
[00:16:56.339 --> 00:16:57.901]  They were meeting with suspicious people.
[00:16:58.361 --> 00:17:01.745]  There was an incident right before this bombing last night in Manchester.
[00:17:02.385 --> 00:17:04.287]  And an eyewitness has come out and talked about it.
[00:17:04.727 --> 00:17:17.159]  She saw what was obviously, although she didn't say it directly, a foreign individual, probably a Muslim individual, looking nervous, looking suspicious, fidgeting with something in her bag, looking back to the area where the bomb went off.
[00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:24.186]  She reported this woman, it looked like it was possibly one of the accomplices, she reported her to the security.
[00:17:24.626 --> 00:17:25.908]  What did the security say?
[00:17:26.488 --> 00:17:34.031]  They said to the woman who was trying to report the suspicious activity, how would you like it if somebody said that you were being suspicious?
[00:17:34.432 --> 00:17:43.395]  So it was obviously by the way she was describing it, because she said she couldn't speak English very well, it was obviously possibly some kind of accomplice to this attack.
[00:17:43.756 --> 00:17:45.556]  The security did nothing about it.
[00:17:45.817 --> 00:17:46.717]  They didn't kick her out.
[00:17:46.757 --> 00:17:47.737]  They didn't even talk to her.
[00:17:47.997 --> 00:17:49.118]  They just left her alone.
[00:17:49.438 --> 00:17:51.299]  So it looks like that could have happened again.
[00:17:51.359 --> 00:17:52.539]  Again, that's not confirmed.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.361]  But in the aftermath of this, Alex, what do we see again?
[00:17:56.101 --> 00:18:06.125]  Liberals, leftists, more outraged about offensive tweets than mangled dead kids than kids with body parts missing.
[00:18:06.165 --> 00:18:07.865]  That's what they're more offended about.
[00:18:08.306 --> 00:18:17.589]  The Met police in London has come out and said they're investigating not the ISIS terrorists, the hundreds of ISIS terrorists running around the country who have been let back in.
[00:18:17.609 --> 00:18:18.209]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:18:18.829 --> 00:18:22.751]  They're investigating Katie Hopkins because she said something offensive on Twitter.
[00:18:23.371 --> 00:18:24.412]  They're actually doing this.
[00:18:24.472 --> 00:18:25.833]  This is what she said on Twitter.
[00:18:26.354 --> 00:18:31.359]  That is hate speech and is now being investigated by the Metropolitan Police after it was reported to them by offended leftists on Twitter.
[00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:44.931]  And Tommy Robinson's joining us.
[00:18:44.951 --> 00:18:48.794]  He's the guy that first reported over a decade ago they were kidnapping and grooming young girls.
[00:18:48.834 --> 00:19:02.423]  Now it's come out in dozens and dozens of towns, thousands per town, sex slavery, killing the young girls, and the police will do nothing because it's politically incorrect to talk bad about a bunch of men with big beards grabbing ten-year-old girls from the bus stops.
[00:19:02.983 --> 00:19:09.288]  I mean, this is just so over the top, the mass Stockholm syndrome that we're witnessing here, Paul.
[00:19:11.112 --> 00:19:13.815]  And it's Stockholm Syndrome on steroids.
[00:19:13.875 --> 00:19:16.517]  The Independent came out with a headline this morning.
[00:19:17.198 --> 00:19:20.702]  Quote, there's only one way Britain should respond to attacks such as Manchester.
[00:19:20.982 --> 00:19:24.065]  That is by carrying on exactly as before.
[00:19:24.606 --> 00:19:29.731]  Just carry on, just forget about it, just wait until it happens again and again and again and again.
[00:19:30.091 --> 00:19:34.733]  You know, Alex, how do the parents of dead kids just carry on exactly as before?
[00:19:35.254 --> 00:19:42.518]  How do the teenage girls who have been dismembered, how are they going to carry on with life just as it was before?
[00:19:42.878 --> 00:19:46.740]  No, that's not bravery to just carry on like nothing's happening.
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.841]  That's frigging cowardice.
[00:19:49.241 --> 00:19:51.723]  But it seems, Alex, we've made a choice as a society.
[00:19:52.183 --> 00:20:00.489]  Again, our leaders place hurt feelings, they rank that as being more important than the actual basic survival and safety of their citizens.
[00:20:00.509 --> 00:20:02.891]  Sure, this is trauma-based mind control.
[00:20:02.951 --> 00:20:04.352]  They know these attacks are coming.
[00:20:04.833 --> 00:20:06.774]  They know that the trendies are being targeted.
[00:20:06.814 --> 00:20:10.137]  They know the helpless population has been domesticated into this position.
[00:20:10.797 --> 00:20:15.441]  And they are testing to just see what you'll put up with, what you'll go along with.
[00:20:16.041 --> 00:20:18.562]  I mean, first it's have taxpayers pay for sex changes.
[00:20:18.982 --> 00:20:22.283]  Then it's, oh, it's bad if you have a mother or father or if you're male or female.
[00:20:22.563 --> 00:20:23.923]  Now having a sex is bad.
[00:20:23.984 --> 00:20:29.605]  Now having your own identity is bad, unless it's a liberal, trendy identity, because this isn't liberal or trendy.
[00:20:29.805 --> 00:20:31.266]  This is an assault on the West.
[00:20:31.566 --> 00:20:32.546]  They'll use Islam.
[00:20:32.826 --> 00:20:34.127]  They'll use pedophile groups.
[00:20:34.367 --> 00:20:42.409]  They'll use anybody they can to scramble civilization to make us so confused with learned helplessness that we will then submit.
[00:20:42.469 --> 00:20:43.310]  I want to play this clip.
[00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:44.410]  This is so surreal.
[00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:47.275]  This was happening as the bombs had just gone off.
[00:20:47.296 --> 00:20:49.039]  They're now saying probably two bombs.
[00:20:50.302 --> 00:20:52.627]  A coordinated effort, but again, who's behind it?
[00:20:52.687 --> 00:20:53.269]  Who helped them?
[00:20:53.369 --> 00:20:53.910]  The government!
[00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:55.450]  Who protected them?
[00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:56.010]  The liberals.
[00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:57.191]  Who went along with it?
[00:20:57.251 --> 00:20:57.851]  The trendies.
[00:20:58.351 --> 00:21:00.032]  Who helped import these groups?
[00:21:00.652 --> 00:21:02.932]  Who backed ISIS and Al-Qaeda in the Arab Spring?
[00:21:03.273 --> 00:21:04.733]  European and the US government.
[00:21:05.153 --> 00:21:07.794]  The globalists are allied with radical Islam.
[00:21:08.354 --> 00:21:10.275]  Manchester arena terror attack.
[00:21:10.715 --> 00:21:12.115]  No problems here message.
[00:21:12.815 --> 00:21:15.556]  This is Sky News announcer tries to calm the crowd.
[00:21:15.576 --> 00:21:17.477]  This is I guess a Sky event.
[00:21:18.542 --> 00:21:22.087]  Exiting the arena but goes a little too far a little too far.
[00:21:22.107 --> 00:21:23.929]  It's like drink your kool-aid.
[00:21:23.969 --> 00:21:24.610]  Everything's fine.
[00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:35.465]  You'll be in heaven soon Goes a little too far by claiming preemptively that there are no problems here and quote We're glad you came out and had a good time tonight as if
[00:21:36.306 --> 00:21:40.368]  He were oblivious to the fact that someone just blew themselves up.
[00:21:40.728 --> 00:21:47.972]  So he's there announcing, there at the Ariana Grande concert, Ariana Grande!
[00:21:48.052 --> 00:21:48.772]  It's so fun!
[00:21:48.992 --> 00:21:50.453]  And nothing bad happened here tonight!
[00:21:50.513 --> 00:21:51.133]  Nothing went on!
[00:21:51.333 --> 00:21:52.354]  You had a great evening!
[00:21:52.634 --> 00:21:53.915]  Your steak was perfect!
[00:21:54.215 --> 00:21:57.356]  You know, like they say at restaurants, your wine was perfect!
[00:21:57.577 --> 00:22:02.339]  Your suicide bomb and flesh and guts and blood of teenagers was wonderful!
[00:22:02.579 --> 00:22:03.980]  You had a fabulous evening!
[00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:08.981]  People say, oh, this is Stockholm Syndrome, this is mind control, this is Jim Jones Kool-Aid drills.
[00:22:09.341 --> 00:22:09.801]  It is!
[00:22:10.302 --> 00:22:15.143]  This is just one step more extreme of the media saying, move along, no big deal.
[00:22:15.363 --> 00:22:17.063]  The answer is bring in more Muslims.
[00:22:17.324 --> 00:22:19.164]  Have our young girls wear hijabs.
[00:22:19.464 --> 00:22:21.225]  That will make the Muslims not kill us.
[00:22:21.465 --> 00:22:22.505]  Let's submit to them.
[00:22:22.545 --> 00:22:23.685]  Let's let them bully us.
[00:22:23.905 --> 00:22:28.747]  Let's roll over, you know, when we bring in folks from some areas in the Middle East that are...
[00:22:30.027 --> 00:22:35.174]  5,000 times plus more often to have birth defects or brain disorders from inbreeding.
[00:22:35.354 --> 00:22:43.485]  Let's bring in a bunch of inbred insane people and let them murder and kill us and kidnap our children and do everything because it's liberal and it's the right thing to do.
[00:22:43.525 --> 00:22:45.468]  Let's let the big brain bug Muslims
[00:22:46.008 --> 00:22:58.152]  Bring in all of the little subgroups they're controlling and then own factories and facilities and have their little elves brain-damaged inbred elves in there working in their basically slave factories.
[00:22:58.552 --> 00:23:03.534]  I mean this is an absolute total takeover and our elites are out to get us.
[00:23:03.874 --> 00:23:08.796]  Here is the mind control right after the bombing telling folks they all had a great evening.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.922]  Ladies and gentlemen, please take your time.
[00:23:15.962 --> 00:23:17.843]  There's no need to bunch up.
[00:23:17.903 --> 00:23:19.505]  There's no problems here.
[00:23:19.605 --> 00:23:22.347]  Just take your time and keep exiting the building.
[00:23:22.367 --> 00:23:25.089]  There's no need to bunch up and run.
[00:23:25.129 --> 00:23:26.130]  Take your time.
[00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:27.791]  There's no problems here.
[00:23:27.871 --> 00:23:30.794]  Thank you for coming and having a good time tonight.
[00:23:30.874 --> 00:23:31.694]  Everything is fine.
[00:23:31.915 --> 00:23:34.036]  Just take your time exiting the building.
[00:23:34.176 --> 00:23:35.317]  Thank you very much.
[00:23:35.517 --> 00:23:38.280]  Thanks for bringing your kids to the event.
[00:23:40.868 --> 00:23:43.331]  And no one's going to try to stop the Muslims coming in and blowing you up.
[00:23:43.612 --> 00:23:45.834]  And some will argue, well, they don't want rioting.
[00:23:45.854 --> 00:23:47.537]  They don't want people stampeding and dying.
[00:23:48.057 --> 00:23:49.079]  You don't have to lie to them.
[00:23:49.099 --> 00:23:52.103]  You just say, please move orderly to the exits.
[00:23:53.733 --> 00:23:55.514]  It appears the event is over, whatever.
[00:23:55.994 --> 00:24:03.476]  But see, the government's bringing in the Muslims, it's bringing in the unvetted Muslims, it's bringing in the thousands of jihadis, knowing this is going to happen.
[00:24:03.496 --> 00:24:08.517]  It's not like the media's saying, be calm, everything's going to be okay, we're going to fix this problem, we're going to deport these people.
[00:24:08.998 --> 00:24:13.239]  No, no, they're just saying, be calm, everything's fine, drink the Kool-Aid, you're going to be in heaven.
[00:24:13.279 --> 00:24:13.799]  Paul Watson.
[00:24:15.319 --> 00:24:18.360]  Well, Alex, the point is they're not just letting them in.
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:21.261]  And I'm going to do a big video expose about this as well.
[00:24:21.881 --> 00:24:27.063]  The NGO boats, this is all George Soros funded, and I'm going to name the organisations by name.
[00:24:27.383 --> 00:24:36.245]  They're going out like a taxi service to 12 miles off the coast of Libya from Italy, picking up these migrants, bringing them back to Italy.
[00:24:36.625 --> 00:24:38.146]  Half of them just go missing.
[00:24:38.746 --> 00:24:45.491]  While ISIS is literally paying their fee to pay the people smugglers if they join ISIS.
[00:24:45.751 --> 00:24:52.536]  And ISIS said three years ago, quote, we're going to have a migrant flood to flood you with our jihadists and bring Europe down.
[00:24:52.797 --> 00:24:55.559]  The UN says yes, opens it up, advertises it.
[00:24:55.879 --> 00:24:57.080]  It's a master plan, Paul.
[00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:57.680]  They've admitted it.
[00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:04.305]  What is the master plan bringing in the sleeper cell army of 5 million plus people, 80% military age men?
[00:25:04.405 --> 00:25:05.206]  What are they planning?
[00:25:06.803 --> 00:25:11.725]  Well, on a purely selfish level, again, the elite, the political elite, they don't have to live amongst this.
[00:25:11.785 --> 00:25:14.286]  They get private chauffeurs to every single event.
[00:25:14.566 --> 00:25:16.027]  They live in their ivory towers.
[00:25:16.367 --> 00:25:18.088]  They don't have to use public transport.
[00:25:18.148 --> 00:25:19.889]  They don't have to use commercial airlines.
[00:25:20.329 --> 00:25:22.450]  You know, they're protected from this.
[00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:23.050]  We're not.
[00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:25.871]  So they don't really have to live in the chaos that they create.
[00:25:26.312 --> 00:25:29.373]  Of course, politically, bringing in huge numbers of people
[00:25:30.353 --> 00:25:36.517]  You can do a map where in Britain you compare the areas where the Muslim ghettos are versus who they vote for.
[00:25:36.877 --> 00:25:40.779]  It's always left-wing political parties who will give them welfare and benefits.
[00:25:41.199 --> 00:25:42.940]  Same in any other European country.
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.741]  So that's the motive.
[00:25:44.801 --> 00:25:46.202]  They want huge voting blocks.
[00:25:46.242 --> 00:25:48.003]  They want to literally destroy society.
[00:25:48.043 --> 00:25:48.403]  They don't.
[00:25:48.843 --> 00:25:51.625]  They don't value or cherish Western values anymore.
[00:25:51.905 --> 00:25:59.609]  They've replaced them with this horrific tolerance idea, which is clearly not working for us, but they don't care because they're in their ivory towers.
[00:25:59.949 --> 00:26:05.733]  But this suicide bomber, Alex, Libyan refugee parents, was born in Manchester.
[00:26:06.153 --> 00:26:09.955]  So we gave his parents refuge in the United Kingdom.
[00:26:10.235 --> 00:26:11.936]  They gave us a suicide bomber.
[00:26:12.316 --> 00:26:13.837]  Oh, but this guy was born here.
[00:26:14.137 --> 00:26:16.759]  So Alex, he's one of the integrated ones.
[00:26:17.119 --> 00:26:20.740]  He's another example of how multiculturalism has worked so well.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:26.841]  Born in this country, blows himself up along with 22, 23 other people.
[00:26:27.361 --> 00:26:32.802]  But don't worry, Alex, because CNN's Jake Tapper tweeted out an image of the Union Jack.
[00:26:33.283 --> 00:26:35.223]  So everything's going to be okay now.
[00:26:35.643 --> 00:26:38.264]  And that's what annoys me the most, is the concern signaling.
[00:26:38.304 --> 00:26:39.004]  Well that's what they do!
[00:26:39.804 --> 00:26:40.164]  Exactly.
[00:26:40.204 --> 00:26:43.487]  Virtue Signaling, they push for the end of the Union Jack.
[00:26:43.727 --> 00:26:45.468]  They try to say, don't fly it, it's racist.
[00:26:45.508 --> 00:26:49.931]  First they, you know, ban what the King George flag and a bunch of others.
[00:26:50.571 --> 00:26:51.972]  And so then they move on.
[00:26:51.992 --> 00:26:58.717]  But then when there's a tragic event, oh, here's your flag, while the globalists are busy killing the culture, killing the identity.
[00:26:59.277 --> 00:27:04.381]  But then they kind of give you as a body bag, a Union Jack colored body bag.
[00:27:05.472 --> 00:27:10.614]  Notice though, Alex, he didn't tweet out a Russian flag last month when all those people got massacred in the St.
[00:27:10.654 --> 00:27:11.734]  Petersburg subway, did he?
[00:27:11.814 --> 00:27:12.054]  Oh no.
[00:27:12.374 --> 00:27:13.915]  It's selective outrage.
[00:27:14.375 --> 00:27:16.936]  Also, again, not all Muslims.
[00:27:16.976 --> 00:27:26.699]  The main concern immediately after 22 people, mostly teenage girls, have been slaughtered and dismembered is not, what do we do to stop this from happening over and over again?
[00:27:27.059 --> 00:27:27.879]  It's, oh no,
[00:27:28.459 --> 00:27:30.520]  Somebody might be mean to Muslims.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.781]  Don't be an Islamophobe.
[00:27:31.841 --> 00:27:33.402]  That's the main concern.
[00:27:33.743 --> 00:27:35.284]  No, it's not the main concern.
[00:27:35.344 --> 00:27:35.964]  It shouldn't be.
[00:27:36.364 --> 00:27:44.650]  And by the way, when Dylan Roof went in, when scumbag Dylan Roof went in and shot, you know, nine poor black people because he was a brainwashed idiot,
[00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:50.395]  The media for months, it was the end of the world, America's evil, all conservatives are racist, all whites are racist.
[00:27:50.695 --> 00:27:54.659]  You've got a brown Muslim guy going and blowing up mainly a bunch of little white girls.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.361]  Are folks going to call this racial?
[00:27:56.381 --> 00:28:00.746]  Because a big component of Islam is anti-white, anti-west.
[00:28:00.786 --> 00:28:01.907]  Let's just get that out there.
[00:28:03.772 --> 00:28:06.534]  Well, here's a tweet, Alex, and it exemplifies this.
[00:28:06.554 --> 00:28:15.279]  It says, and this literally got like 50, 60,000 retweets, Muslims are to blame when in reality Muslim taxi drivers are offering free lifts.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:23.365]  OK, so because some Muslim taxi drivers are offering free rides, that means there's not a problem with Islam and violence.
[00:28:23.445 --> 00:28:24.445]  No, it doesn't work like that.
[00:28:24.685 --> 00:28:27.747]  But that is the level of idiocy we're dealing with.
[00:28:28.028 --> 00:28:31.290]  That is literally the most tweeted thing today on Twitter.
[00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:32.931]  That's what we're dealing with.
[00:28:33.371 --> 00:28:34.732]  Again, empty platitudes from celebrities.
[00:28:34.752 --> 00:28:35.653]  Really, you know what's funny?
[00:28:35.793 --> 00:28:39.296]  The last few times I was in the UK, it was almost all Muslim taxi drivers.
[00:28:39.636 --> 00:28:53.087]  They would shake me down for double the rate to take me to my hotel laughing at me until I would run into a British taxi driver and they would let me in and actually only charge me the regular rate and apologize to me and say, you know, this is London stand now, mate.
[00:28:55.165 --> 00:28:57.867]  Yeah, but it's, again, look at the stats, OK?
[00:28:57.947 --> 00:29:00.710]  It's not a tiny fringe.
[00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:06.976]  34% of British Muslims say they would not inform police if they knew someone was getting involved with ISIS.
[00:29:06.996 --> 00:29:08.437]  34%, sorry, only 34% would inform.
[00:29:11.079 --> 00:29:18.321]  So, in fact, the vast majority of British Muslims would not tell police if someone they knew was joining ISIS.
[00:29:18.362 --> 00:29:20.482]  We saw the same thing in Belgium after Paris.
[00:29:20.502 --> 00:29:22.043]  But it's not the Muslims' fault!
[00:29:22.423 --> 00:29:25.644]  It's conservatives, nationalists, libertarians, and it's my fault, Paul.
[00:29:26.104 --> 00:29:28.105]  Media Matters is saying it's my fault.
[00:29:28.605 --> 00:29:29.305]  I'm a bad fact.
[00:29:29.425 --> 00:29:30.686]  I don't like the children that died.
[00:29:30.746 --> 00:29:31.346]  Total lie.
[00:29:31.906 --> 00:29:36.409]  I'm saying the trendies in the UK that say, open the borders up, bring this in, they're to blame.
[00:29:36.649 --> 00:29:41.892]  And you know that stadium had adults and others that were in it that totally are cuckold and are pushing for this.
[00:29:42.132 --> 00:29:43.433]  The left has to embrace it.
[00:29:43.513 --> 00:29:47.735]  You love Islam, you love sexual mutilation, you love hajibs.
[00:29:47.915 --> 00:29:50.457]  Paul Watson, Alex Jones, and the GMBN Radio News.
[00:29:50.557 --> 00:29:50.957]  Be safe.
[00:29:50.977 --> 00:29:52.958]  Tommy Robinson from the UK as well coming up.
[00:29:52.978 --> 00:29:53.379]  Stay with us.
[00:29:56.195 --> 00:30:02.157]  Prepping for disaster and societal unrest has now gone so mainstream that even Realtor.com is writing about it.
[00:30:02.297 --> 00:30:11.401]  But the Realtors are still embarrassed to cover the subject and eager to set themselves apart from what they call Uncle Travis' guns and canned foods militia vision of preparedness.
[00:30:11.541 --> 00:30:13.882]  Well, the ants may have the last laugh
[00:30:14.102 --> 00:30:15.082]  ...on the grasshoppers.
[00:30:15.282 --> 00:30:18.343]  But the grasshoppers will still sing the tune, if they can make money.
[00:30:18.524 --> 00:30:25.066]  But maybe you don't have a Hollywood mansion where you can drop another million dollars to turn your home theater into a radiation-proof bunker.
[00:30:25.206 --> 00:30:29.447]  There are still very effective, low-tech, low-cost things you can do to prepare.
[00:30:29.687 --> 00:30:37.150]  In fact, even realizing that there's a need to prepare and doing anything to act on that realization increases your chances of survival.
[00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:43.552]  Things that you do to prepare for an Armageddon scenario will help you to weather storms, to absorb an economic shock,
[00:30:43.832 --> 00:30:45.573]  Or to protect you from home invasion.
[00:30:45.933 --> 00:30:51.697]  Prepare for the worst case scenario while you educate yourself and others and work for the best case scenario.
[00:30:51.917 --> 00:30:54.298]  Get more information at InfoWars.com.
[00:30:54.798 --> 00:30:55.339]  I'm David Knight.
[00:30:56.264 --> 00:31:04.028]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.

[00:31:10.891 --> 00:31:19.175]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[00:31:19.455 --> 00:31:28.200]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:34.223]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[00:31:34.563 --> 00:31:35.024]  It works.
[00:31:35.324 --> 00:31:43.632]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[00:31:43.652 --> 00:31:53.181]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfowarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Infowar against the Globalists all at the same time.

[00:32:29.867 --> 00:32:35.833]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[00:32:45.602 --> 00:32:53.770]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[00:33:12.478 --> 00:33:16.385]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:17.987 --> 00:33:22.695]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:37.952 --> 00:33:43.894]  Families and many young people were out to enjoy a concert at the Manchester Arena and have very sadly lost their lives.
[00:33:44.934 --> 00:33:52.716]  Our thoughts are with those 22 victims that we now know have died, the 59 people who have been injured and their loved ones.
[00:33:53.636 --> 00:34:00.298]  We continue to do all we can to support them and they are being treated at eight hospitals across Greater Manchester.
[00:34:01.656 --> 00:34:09.758]  We have been treating this as a terrorist incident, and we believe at this stage, the attack last night was conducted by one man.
[00:34:10.558 --> 00:34:15.539]  The priority is to establish whether he was acting alone or as part of a network.
[00:34:16.759 --> 00:34:19.779]  The attacker, I can confirm, died at the arena.
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:27.541]  We believe the attacker was carrying an improvised explosive device, which he detonated, causing this atrocity.
[00:34:28.959 --> 00:34:32.902]  We would ask people not to speculate on his details or share names.
[00:34:33.783 --> 00:34:36.405]  This is a complex and wide-ranging investigation.
[00:34:37.706 --> 00:34:48.214]  Our priority is to work with the National Counter-Terrorist Policing Network and UK intelligence services to establish more details about the individual who carried out this attack.
[00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:51.421]  They're also everywhere saying, we don't know who helped him.
[00:34:51.461 --> 00:34:52.161]  How did this happen?
[00:34:52.421 --> 00:34:54.922]  The government of the UK opened the borders up.
[00:34:55.282 --> 00:34:55.903]  Bipartisan.
[00:34:55.923 --> 00:34:56.983]  They brought these people in.
[00:34:57.263 --> 00:35:00.324]  They demonized anybody that spoke out against it, or stood up.
[00:35:01.105 --> 00:35:02.645]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[00:35:02.665 --> 00:35:06.127]  They know exactly what they've been engaged in.
[00:35:06.347 --> 00:35:17.291]  I'm not saying the individual police officers are to blame, but basically everyone in the UK, everyone in the US, everyone in Europe, I don't care what color you are, or where you came from, if you're not an Islamic extremist, an Islamic orthodox,
[00:35:17.711 --> 00:35:29.678]  Attacker we all are to blame for not standing up against the arrogance of the Islamist leaders and their puppets Like the new French president who has said get used to Islamic terror.
[00:35:29.738 --> 00:35:30.579]  It's the new way of life.
[00:35:30.879 --> 00:35:34.041]  Just get used to it We're not gonna call Islamic terror when it happens.
[00:35:34.301 --> 00:35:35.522]  We're just gonna call it terror.
[00:35:36.142 --> 00:35:36.602]  Well here is
[00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:46.815]  The mayor of Londonstan, Sadiq Khan, who's starting to ban images of women in bikinis, you know, in public signage, he's bringing in Sharia law.
[00:35:47.196 --> 00:35:48.997]  Here he is, running his arrogant mouth.
[00:35:49.257 --> 00:35:52.239]  He says he doesn't care if the UK blocks new Muslims flooding in.
[00:35:52.539 --> 00:35:54.660]  He'll bring them into London itself!
[00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:56.261]  He'll set up a safe zone!
[00:35:56.501 --> 00:36:05.667]  He'll set up a sanctuary city for the loving Islamists that are all fleeing their own godforsaken countries where they're killing each other and having on average six kids!
[00:36:07.441 --> 00:36:12.386]  It's like, it's like sticking your arm into a bunch of piranhas with blood dripping off your hand.
[00:36:12.526 --> 00:36:13.747]  They're gonna chew your arm off.
[00:36:13.987 --> 00:36:26.059]  I'm sorry, let's go to this arrogant slimebag who just can't believe how Stockholm Syndrome-ed the West is and now he's just arrogantly rolling everyone, smiling with a big fat smile.
[00:36:26.319 --> 00:36:27.760]  Care's not gonna stop!
[00:36:29.282 --> 00:36:30.844]  And it's just the way it is!
[00:36:30.904 --> 00:36:31.444]  Here he is!
[00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:50.161]  The advice we've received from the police service here and from the mayor's office is to carry on business as usual.
[00:36:50.361 --> 00:36:53.582]  I'm not going to speculate as to who is responsible.
[00:36:53.642 --> 00:36:57.782]  I'm not going to speculate as to how the police in New York should react.
[00:36:57.862 --> 00:37:03.563]  What I do know is part and parcel of living in a great global city is you've got to be prepared for these things.
[00:37:03.723 --> 00:37:04.864]  You've got to be vigilant.
[00:37:04.964 --> 00:37:07.724]  You've got to support the police doing an incredibly hard job.
[00:37:07.864 --> 00:37:09.664]  You've got to support the security services.
[00:37:09.804 --> 00:37:13.105]  And I think speculating when you don't know the facts is unwise.
[00:37:14.656 --> 00:37:17.718]  Now, Macron went even further.
[00:37:17.758 --> 00:37:19.499]  We've put the transcript of that up on screen.
[00:37:19.519 --> 00:37:20.360]  We've got it in French.
[00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:22.441]  He just said, this is the way it is.
[00:37:22.801 --> 00:37:26.304]  And by the way, his latest statements are, we shouldn't worry about being France.
[00:37:26.664 --> 00:37:27.424]  We're now the EU.
[00:37:27.604 --> 00:37:28.905]  Well, what's the EU?
[00:37:28.985 --> 00:37:31.027]  It's now imploding the borders of Europe.
[00:37:31.967 --> 00:37:37.371]  It gets rid of your internal borders, opens the external contiguous border, and then brings in the Islamists.
[00:37:39.292 --> 00:37:45.055]  Then the Green Party and everybody announces, yes, Islam is the future, submit to it, give your daughters to it.
[00:37:45.336 --> 00:37:55.341]  You listen to this, and it's the most bizarre, over-the-top signals of conquest I've ever seen, and our own elites are celebrating it.
[00:37:55.381 --> 00:37:57.563]  So joining us is Tommy Robinson.
[00:37:58.581 --> 00:38:12.382]  TheRebelMedia.com, TommyRobinson.co.uk, he's pointed out that they're at war, the government knows they're at war, and the government is basically at war against the people with Islam, using Islam to take the average Brits right.
[00:38:13.206 --> 00:38:23.249]  Whether you're a Sikh Brit, or a Christian Brit, or an Atheist Brit, whether you're white, or whether you're a black African from, you know, South Africa that happens to be a Christian, you don't have any rights.
[00:38:23.429 --> 00:38:25.550]  Only the loving Muslims do.
[00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:26.510]  They're the God.
[00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:35.313]  How did they get in this position, and what do you make of 22 dead, mainly teenage girls, and the media trying to spin this and saying it's non-Islamic?
[00:38:37.394 --> 00:38:39.194]  Alex, I've been in Manchester all day.
[00:38:39.214 --> 00:38:40.815]  I've listened to all the mainstream media.
[00:38:41.593 --> 00:38:43.935]  I've not heard one of them mention the word Islam.
[00:38:44.275 --> 00:38:45.977]  Not one of them.
[00:38:46.337 --> 00:38:48.959]  I've started looking then into Islam in Manchester.
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.861]  I've travelled to an extremist mosque.
[00:38:52.802 --> 00:39:02.390]  When I was standing at that position outside that mosque, within a two mile radius of where I was, there have been 16 Muslims convicted or killed in terrorism.
[00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:06.433]  One last year who drove a suicide truck into people in Iraq.
[00:39:07.344 --> 00:39:12.665]  We had another Muslim called Burgos who murdered a police officer in Manchester.
[00:39:13.245 --> 00:39:17.226]  He comes to the country three years prior in the back of a van as a refugee.
[00:39:18.367 --> 00:39:19.507]  He was actually in prison.
[00:39:19.527 --> 00:39:23.148]  When I was in prison in 2012, he was in control of the prison.
[00:39:23.608 --> 00:39:26.749]  So all these solutions, we need to lock them up and send them to prison.
[00:39:27.289 --> 00:39:30.690]  Burgos is living a complete halal life after killing a police officer.
[00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:32.970]  He's converting and radicalising more people.
[00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:35.071]  He certainly is not learning any lesson.
[00:39:35.371 --> 00:39:36.691]  He's adding to our problems.
[00:39:37.952 --> 00:39:41.795]  And exactly what you've been saying is our political leaders are working with them.
[00:39:42.355 --> 00:39:49.421]  Tonight at six o'clock in Manchester there is a peace vigil being held by the Mayor Burnham.
[00:39:49.941 --> 00:39:51.662]  He's a Labour MP called Burnham.
[00:39:52.423 --> 00:39:58.488]  Now, he last year shared a platform and a stage with an Islamic group called MEN.
[00:39:59.108 --> 00:40:01.210]  This is an Islamic radical group.
[00:40:02.003 --> 00:40:13.853]  Another MP in this area who is the Justice Secretary for the Labour Party, she received £5,000 cash given to her for her campaign by an Islamic radical group in this area.
[00:40:14.653 --> 00:40:16.675]  The Labour Party are in bed.
[00:40:17.115 --> 00:40:18.736]  They're in bed with the radicals.
[00:40:18.997 --> 00:40:30.046]  When we're seeing what right now the people on our TV who are telling us we will get through this, we will beat this, are the people working hand in hand with the radical Islamic group.
[00:40:30.786 --> 00:40:38.773]  The people who are facilitating our daughters to be killed and raped in order for vote bank politics to regain power with the Labour Party.
[00:40:39.074 --> 00:40:40.875]  They're the people telling us it will all be alright.
[00:40:41.416 --> 00:40:45.660]  As soon as I've started digging, it's took me 10 minutes in Manchester to find the link.
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:47.101]  Well, we all know what it's going to take.
[00:40:47.381 --> 00:40:53.167]  It's going to take the politicians that are aiding and abetting a foreign cancerous political cult.
[00:40:54.349 --> 00:41:02.532]  To be brought to justice one way or another, the politicians that are letting these little girls get blown up and murdered and all the rest of it, they're the ones that are aiding and abetting.
[00:41:02.552 --> 00:41:05.272]  They're just as guilty as the jihadi that blew himself up.
[00:41:05.553 --> 00:41:11.775]  And I'm sorry, you start asking the question, I'm asking you this again, when do you think people in the UK are going to start taking things into their own hands?
[00:41:13.375 --> 00:41:19.217]  Alex, I keep asking myself, when you've watched what's happened here, what is it going to take?
[00:41:20.595 --> 00:41:22.504]  What is it going to take before Englishmen?
[00:41:22.806 --> 00:41:24.856]  It becomes an embarrassing situation.
[00:41:28.867 --> 00:41:31.268]  We're not.
[00:41:32.088 --> 00:41:40.952]  I look now, I'm 20 miles from a town called Rochdale where there's been a programme where an entire generation of youth were gang raped and tortured by Muslim men.
[00:41:41.152 --> 00:41:48.995]  Those Muslim men are now out of prison after less than three or four years and they're walking around the town of Rochdale where the girls are that they raped.
[00:41:49.535 --> 00:41:51.396]  What has happened to us as a race?
[00:41:51.716 --> 00:41:56.918]  What has happened to us as a country that we're allowing this such systematic abuses of our people?
[00:41:57.259 --> 00:41:58.119]  We're allowing now
[00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:07.367]  A concert now where our daughters are being massacred and maimed, and this is all being facilitated, and no one is doing anything.
[00:42:07.407 --> 00:42:14.693]  So again, I can't answer your question, Alex, because I ask myself every time, when Leaving Me was beheaded, I said, this has to be it.
[00:42:15.154 --> 00:42:19.878]  When this happened earlier, and I'm watching it, and I'm seeing daughters and young girls, an eight-year-old girl has gone.
[00:42:19.898 --> 00:42:22.941]  Twenty-two young British people are dead.
[00:42:23.862 --> 00:42:25.223]  What is it going to take?
[00:42:26.269 --> 00:42:27.249]  What is he going to take?
[00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:29.110]  We've got the same response!
[00:42:29.551 --> 00:42:31.391]  But there's a peace vigil in half an hour!
[00:42:31.411 --> 00:42:32.132]  A peace vigil!
[00:42:32.712 --> 00:42:34.133]  What is that peace vigil going to do?
[00:42:34.673 --> 00:42:38.915]  All the peace vigil is, is a giant white flag begging these folks to kill more.
[00:42:38.955 --> 00:42:41.356]  And notice when we're trying to take out non-radical Islam groups.
[00:42:41.776 --> 00:42:48.780]  In Syria, and they have this clear fake false flag chemical attack, they've been caught doing it before, they show the kids gulping and dying for air.
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:56.365]  But every time there's a suicide truck or a shooting or a bombing, they blur out the people, they won't show the dead girls, they won't show the dead bodies.
[00:42:56.605 --> 00:43:04.790]  It's going to take showing on the news, the Islamists is taking credit, bragging how they're going to kill your sons and daughters, bragging how they're going to kill your police,
[00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:12.936]  Bragging how they're going to do all this and then showing the dead girls or dying girls flopping around with their guts hanging out begging for mommy.
[00:43:13.196 --> 00:43:14.397]  It's going to take showing that.
[00:43:15.798 --> 00:43:24.085]  What did the Blacklam, in the Blacklam Theatre, where people's genitals were cut off and fed to them, where young girls were raped with knives.
[00:43:24.705 --> 00:43:25.866]  They were raped with knives.
[00:43:25.886 --> 00:43:26.707]  They were tortured.
[00:43:27.688 --> 00:43:29.129]  That changed nothing in France.
[00:43:29.938 --> 00:43:32.361]  In fact, they've surrendered even further since then.
[00:43:33.061 --> 00:43:37.226]  Do I sit and look at this situation now and ask, what's going to happen?
[00:43:38.367 --> 00:43:39.068]  Probably nothing!
[00:43:39.793 --> 00:43:50.817]  But unfortunately, and that's heartbreaking, and then we all get told, Alex, we get told, Paul gets told, you get told, we get told that we're rejoicing somehow in this.
[00:43:51.417 --> 00:43:53.458]  Rejoicing is something we've tried to prevent.
[00:43:53.858 --> 00:43:55.639]  We get told that we're pushing our agenda.
[00:43:56.059 --> 00:43:57.820]  Our only agenda is to stop this.
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:03.142]  To stop and prevent it happening to more children, to more women, to more British people.
[00:44:04.099 --> 00:44:12.606]  And somehow the same people who accuse us of that are the same people saying we need to invite more and work more and it's our fault and we need to accept Islam more.
[00:44:13.367 --> 00:44:21.533]  I'm just, I'm sick to death of it and I can't believe English men, I keep asking what is it going to take for you to get up?
[00:44:21.853 --> 00:44:24.355]  The whole country should be brought to a standstill by now.
[00:44:24.656 --> 00:44:30.680]  Every single city in this country should be gridlocked with men and family men coming out with the bargain, something's done!
[00:44:31.501 --> 00:44:32.382]  What is it going to take?
[00:44:34.178 --> 00:44:40.963]  For those who don't know your history, you were a good guy, family guy, our family guy, put in prison for just having peaceful protest.
[00:44:41.303 --> 00:44:45.026]  You've been attacked literally hundreds of times, more than 50 times I've seen on video.
[00:44:45.306 --> 00:44:52.012]  They don't let you march anywhere in the country with the British flag because that's a sign of hate in your own country.
[00:44:52.692 --> 00:44:57.333]  We now have the 9th Circuit banning the American flag here on the East Coast saying it's a sign of hate.
[00:44:57.633 --> 00:45:08.175]  So tell us about what happened a few weeks ago because we're going to play this video for TV and radio listeners just to give folks an idea of what it's like for you when you discover what a local member of government was up to.
[00:45:08.536 --> 00:45:10.036]  You went to his offices and what happened?
[00:45:11.016 --> 00:45:14.897]  So a local Labour Muslim councillor
[00:45:15.552 --> 00:45:20.536]  When these men, a gang of men, nine men, they had raped 48 young English girls, 48!
[00:45:21.657 --> 00:45:32.705]  When they were taken to court and prosecuted, the ex-Muslim mayor and the Labour councillor went to court and gave them references to say what great men they were.
[00:45:33.265 --> 00:45:34.186]  What great men they are!
[00:45:35.722 --> 00:45:43.747]  The councillor was also responsible for getting them their taxi licence that they used to traffic the young English girls in whilst they were torturing and raping them.
[00:45:44.448 --> 00:45:49.411]  I went to see the councillor to ask him questions of how he's still in power.
[00:45:49.631 --> 00:45:50.932]  He's actually been promoted, Alex.
[00:45:51.272 --> 00:45:52.493]  He's been promoted since this.
[00:45:53.153 --> 00:46:01.999]  I went there and I was met by gangs of violence, gangs of Muslims who ran me off the road, who attacked me to prevent me, to prevent me talking to him.
[00:46:02.499 --> 00:46:02.980]  But again,
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:06.742]  The message we give then is, I will find that counsellor.
[00:46:07.183 --> 00:46:08.444]  This week I will find him.
[00:46:08.804 --> 00:46:19.132]  We will not let it rest because although I keep saying what will it take, I have seen something lit in the last three months when I meet every Englishman, they're buzzing for it.
[00:46:19.512 --> 00:46:21.774]  And they're saying, I can see the support.
[00:46:21.794 --> 00:46:24.856]  Well I'll say this, nobody should look for a fight but these people are looking for one.
[00:46:25.216 --> 00:46:27.018]  People need to start getting as good as they give.
[00:46:27.038 --> 00:46:29.800]  People need to start getting a little bit of you know what.
[00:46:31.978 --> 00:46:42.804]  The worrying thing is, that the government need to listen to, is that a point is going to come, when if you don't protect us, then English men will.
[00:46:43.704 --> 00:46:45.926]  English men will, because they will have to.
[00:46:46.206 --> 00:46:51.949]  I can't understand, when I'm looking at Manchester now, from my hometown of Luton, when our soldiers were attacked,
[00:46:52.765 --> 00:46:58.507]  We give birth to the United People of Luton, which then become the English Defence League, which the whole world heard about.
[00:46:59.047 --> 00:47:02.608]  I look at what's happened in Rochdale, and I bang my head and ask, where are the men?
[00:47:03.288 --> 00:47:04.269]  Where are the Englishmen?
[00:47:04.289 --> 00:47:06.909]  I want to know where the Englishmen are in Manchester.
[00:47:07.289 --> 00:47:09.490]  Where is the reaction to what they have just done?
[00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:10.991]  Where is the reaction?
[00:47:11.011 --> 00:47:13.071]  Because it's took me 10 minutes to find the mosque.
[00:47:13.351 --> 00:47:15.032]  It's took me 10 minutes to find where they are.
[00:47:15.472 --> 00:47:19.413]  It took me 10 minutes to find the men that have radicalised and promoted this ideology.
[00:47:19.833 --> 00:47:21.414]  And they're walking around this city now.
[00:47:22.253 --> 00:47:22.894]  But that is it!
[00:47:23.154 --> 00:47:24.476]  And he shouldn't have to take that.
[00:47:24.717 --> 00:47:27.581]  But at some point, a breaking point is going to come.
[00:47:28.061 --> 00:47:30.545]  And when that point does come, it's not going to be good for Islam.
[00:47:30.785 --> 00:47:32.888]  It's not going to be good for the decent Muslims.
[00:47:33.189 --> 00:47:34.510]  And that's what they need to understand.
[00:47:34.530 --> 00:47:38.116]  Get your house in order before you leave it upon the British public to get it in order.
[00:47:40.327 --> 00:47:46.829]  I think this political correctness is going to trigger things down the road when the Middle East gets turned into a glass parking lot, and I don't even want to see that happen.
[00:47:46.849 --> 00:47:53.692]  I didn't want the clash of civilizations, but I just can see now that our elites have allied with Islam as their foot soldiers.
[00:47:53.752 --> 00:47:54.372]  It's dangerous.
[00:47:54.432 --> 00:47:55.132]  It's disgusting.
[00:47:55.613 --> 00:48:04.576]  I want to play a clip of you just a few weeks ago being attacked, run off the road and attacked by a bunch of out-of-control arrogant thugs because you dared try to go do an interview.
[00:48:04.616 --> 00:48:04.916]  Here it is.
[00:48:06.257 --> 00:48:07.098]  We was in Rochdale.
[00:48:07.338 --> 00:48:09.179]  We were in Rochdale to see Councillor Hussain.
[00:48:09.539 --> 00:48:10.520]  He's a Labour councillor.
[00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:17.244]  You've all watched the documentary for Free Girls, which shows the rape and prostitution of a generation of kids in Rochdale by Muslim gangs.
[00:48:17.824 --> 00:48:22.628]  Councillor Hussain went to court to defend and give a character reference for one of those men.
[00:48:23.368 --> 00:48:27.071]  Who is now convicted in prison as part of a gang who raped 98 young English kids.
[00:48:27.771 --> 00:48:28.952]  He's still part of the Labour Party.
[00:48:29.412 --> 00:48:32.454]  We went there to ask him, and to tell him he has to resign.
[00:48:32.815 --> 00:48:35.156]  Out of respect to the victims, he has to resign.
[00:48:35.516 --> 00:48:37.058]  He cannot be involved in British politics.
[00:48:37.738 --> 00:48:40.380]  When we got there to see Councillor Usain, there were cars waiting.
[00:48:41.485 --> 00:48:42.726]  Straight away they tried to block the road.
[00:48:42.746 --> 00:48:43.446]  There was four cars.
[00:48:43.466 --> 00:48:44.227]  They tried to block the road.
[00:48:44.267 --> 00:48:46.969]  Unfortunately our camera wasn't even rolling because we hadn't even got out of the car.
[00:48:47.769 --> 00:48:48.770]  So they tried to block the road.
[00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:50.451]  I had to go up on the pavement to get away.
[00:48:51.091 --> 00:48:53.573]  Then you'll see, in the footage you'll see, that's where it starts.
[00:48:53.953 --> 00:48:57.316]  Where I pull up, a car pulls up next to me and I ask them, why are you trying to block the road?
[00:48:57.336 --> 00:48:58.236]  Why are you trying to block us in?
[00:48:58.716 --> 00:49:00.057]  Why are you all jumping out of cars?
[00:49:00.518 --> 00:49:02.759]  At that point you'll see our car window was smashed.
[00:49:03.199 --> 00:49:04.040]  I then drove on.
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:06.562]  You'll see another young Muslim try and punch through the window.
[00:49:08.764 --> 00:49:12.426]  And then we've been proceeding in a bit of a car chase with some cars full of Muslims.
[00:49:12.926 --> 00:49:14.387]  That's pretty much it.
[00:49:14.447 --> 00:49:16.268]  And then there was a little bit of ramming on the road as well.
[00:49:16.928 --> 00:49:19.369]  So, this doesn't change anything.
[00:49:19.449 --> 00:49:25.452]  Councillor Hussein, if you think that you can get your street gangs, and this is the worrying thing for me, is that
[00:49:26.243 --> 00:49:33.469]  You have street-level gangs who are drug dealers, and who are pimping and prostituting young English girls, and then you have Labour representatives going to court.
[00:49:33.769 --> 00:49:35.391]  The ex-mayor... Alright, let's stop right there.
[00:49:35.411 --> 00:49:36.632]  We're going to go on a break.
[00:49:36.652 --> 00:49:40.575]  The full video is up on Infowars.com, and we covered it just last week.
[00:49:40.615 --> 00:49:44.859]  We're going to go on a break and come back and look at some of the facts of what just happened, and the different numbers.
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:48.142]  Five million military-age men have been brought in.
[00:49:50.922 --> 00:50:04.916]  It's like 6-7 million refugees total, 5 million in the last 3-4 years, 80% military age men, thousands and thousands every month coming in that they admit, Interpol admits, are ISIS, are Al Qaeda, and they're letting them back in.
[00:50:04.956 --> 00:50:12.584]  In Sweden and Belgium and places, you can pull up the news, they have government funding and welfare for them to quote,
[00:50:13.485 --> 00:50:21.470]  Help them that they have PTSD like they're soldiers of Sweden or soldiers of Denmark or soldiers of Belgium.
[00:50:22.931 --> 00:50:24.212]  And they bring them in and actually...
[00:50:25.273 --> 00:50:27.435]  Pay for them and put them on welfare.
[00:50:27.475 --> 00:50:28.776]  I mean, this is the craziest thing.
[00:50:29.256 --> 00:50:46.850]  Also, when we come back, I'm going to do a brief plug here because we fund this operation by the products we sell at InfoWarsTore.com, and we have been sold out of a bunch of our best-selling products for months, like Super Metal Vitality X2 for a few weeks, and other products, and those are our main funders, so it's been hurtful to not have those.
[00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:54.876]  They're back in, and we have them discounted out of the gates for the Memorial Day holiday, InfoWarsTore.com, so take advantage of that.
[00:50:56.363 --> 00:50:58.627]  Imagine the world without InfoWars.
[00:50:59.848 --> 00:51:02.452]  The globalists have already consolidated their power.
[00:51:04.491 --> 00:51:08.153]  They don't want people to have their own economies, their own choices.
[00:51:08.873 --> 00:51:22.199]  When you spread the links to Infowars.com news stories and our videos, when you tell friends, family, and neighbors about our free iPhone and Droid apps, or send them a link to our daily podcast, you are involved in a revolutionary act against tyranny.
[00:51:22.619 --> 00:51:27.842]  It was George Orwell that said, in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[00:51:28.562 --> 00:51:32.384]  That's why I spend a lot of time trying to not just innovate,
[00:51:33.664 --> 00:51:39.766]  News and analysis and our fight against the globalists, but also thinking about how we're able to fund our operation.
[00:51:40.046 --> 00:51:42.867]  That's so critical to prosecute an information war.
[00:51:43.788 --> 00:51:58.693]  And I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic and high quality.
[00:51:59.093 --> 00:52:01.254]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we have private labeled it.
[00:52:02.634 --> 00:52:14.979]  And it is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emrix Essentials, and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from InfoWareStore.com.
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:24.423]  On top of that, if you sign up for AutoShip, you get an additional, out of the gates, 25% off on this product.
[00:52:25.004 --> 00:52:30.146]  Emrix Essentials is all about personal care, hygiene, not getting skin cancer.
[00:52:30.646 --> 00:52:34.329]  Not getting bit by a bunch of bugs and gnats and mosquitoes.
[00:52:34.829 --> 00:52:35.790]  It's all there.
[00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:40.052]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash.
[00:52:40.473 --> 00:52:42.594]  All of it is truly game-changing.
[00:52:43.074 --> 00:52:43.855]  Be-A-Way Spray.
[00:52:44.175 --> 00:52:46.177]  Totally organic, essential oils.
[00:52:46.917 --> 00:52:50.459]  Works a lot better than the toxic chemical systems that are out there.
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:53.121]  And it is comparable in price.
[00:52:53.421 --> 00:52:54.842]  And again, it's concentrated.
[00:52:55.183 --> 00:52:56.604]  The deodorant is amazing.
[00:52:57.084 --> 00:52:57.744]  High quality.
[00:52:58.425 --> 00:52:59.966]  Doesn't have the aluminum garbage in it.
[00:53:00.266 --> 00:53:00.986]  Totally natural.
[00:53:01.267 --> 00:53:01.767]  Works great.
[00:53:02.688 --> 00:53:05.529]  SPF 30 face and body lotion sunscreen.
[00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:06.470]  Unscented.
[00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:07.971]  This is exciting.
[00:53:08.071 --> 00:53:11.754]  Because so many of the so-called sunscreens that are out there are toxic.
[00:53:12.254 --> 00:53:14.215]  As everyone knows, I'm obsessed with Win-Wins.
[00:53:14.235 --> 00:53:14.876]  20% off what it is retail.
[00:53:17.397 --> 00:53:22.000]  Because we cut out the middleman, and then additionally you sign up for auto-ship out of the gates.
[00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:23.801]  25% off that.
[00:53:24.261 --> 00:53:26.282]  Because I want you to try these products.
[00:53:26.422 --> 00:53:27.663]  I want you to love these products.
[00:53:28.003 --> 00:53:38.629]  I want to have a deeper relationship with you in a 360 win, a non-zero-sum game, where you get high quality, you get value, and you repeat order something you need every month.
[00:53:39.509 --> 00:53:47.136]  And then we're able to secure our funding into the future to not just stay at the level we're at, but to grow in the face of enemy attacks.
[00:53:47.416 --> 00:53:52.041]  InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, and you'll find Emmerich's Essentials.
[00:54:06.656 --> 00:54:09.698]  You can run on for a long time.
[00:54:10.298 --> 00:54:12.579]  Run on for a long time.
[00:54:13.259 --> 00:54:15.401]  Run on for a long time.
[00:54:15.741 --> 00:54:16.781]  You know, I didn't even know.
[00:54:16.801 --> 00:54:18.542]  Let's punch up on screen for TV viewers.
[00:54:18.662 --> 00:54:20.803]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:54:21.043 --> 00:54:21.784]  Tommy Robinson.
[00:54:23.303 --> 00:54:26.125]  Is the Paul Revere of the UK warning of all this?
[00:54:26.245 --> 00:54:27.726]  Everything he said turned out to be true.
[00:54:28.046 --> 00:54:29.967]  Giant child kidnapping rings per town.
[00:54:30.287 --> 00:54:31.448]  Hundreds of missing kids.
[00:54:31.588 --> 00:54:33.369]  Hundreds of dead nationwide.
[00:54:33.429 --> 00:54:34.290]  Thousands missing.
[00:54:35.110 --> 00:54:36.191]  It all came out in court.
[00:54:36.211 --> 00:54:37.572]  He was put in prison.
[00:54:37.892 --> 00:54:39.833]  They should make a movie about this guy.
[00:54:40.194 --> 00:54:41.995]  The persecution, how they called him racist.
[00:54:42.275 --> 00:54:42.935]  None of it was true.
[00:54:43.396 --> 00:54:44.876]  He was exposing people that were racist.
[00:54:45.357 --> 00:54:48.239]  And now, I didn't even know that he was late even coming on with us.
[00:54:48.279 --> 00:54:50.080]  He's marching to the vigil.
[00:54:51.147 --> 00:54:54.512]  That the politicians involved working with the Muslims are holding the vigil.
[00:54:55.093 --> 00:54:56.795]  And then his screen just went dead.
[00:54:56.815 --> 00:55:00.741]  I was going to see if we could get him back on as he goes to the...
[00:55:02.463 --> 00:55:03.784]  Vigil, but we just lost him.
[00:55:04.224 --> 00:55:04.524]  Wow.
[00:55:05.465 --> 00:55:06.906]  That's how fast stuff's moving here.
[00:55:07.146 --> 00:55:08.467]  We called Tommy and said, could you come on?
[00:55:08.487 --> 00:55:09.427]  He goes, yes, I can come on.
[00:55:09.447 --> 00:55:11.129]  And then during the break he goes, I gotta go.
[00:55:11.169 --> 00:55:12.229]  The vigil's in five minutes.
[00:55:12.269 --> 00:55:14.631]  It's starting now, but I'm only two blocks away.
[00:55:14.651 --> 00:55:17.773]  And then he starts walking up to the vigil right as the feed cut.
[00:55:18.353 --> 00:55:20.374]  So this is real TV, folks.
[00:55:20.715 --> 00:55:21.335]  Real radio.
[00:55:21.495 --> 00:55:21.775]  Wow.
[00:55:23.256 --> 00:55:24.197]  That guy is amazing.
[00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:32.482]  I'll be honest, I used to see his stuff 10 years ago and go, oh, look at that racist or whatever, just as the media said it.
[00:55:33.083 --> 00:55:34.724]  That's how weak-minded even I am.
[00:55:34.764 --> 00:55:36.444]  Folks, they lie about everybody.
[00:55:38.065 --> 00:55:43.568]  If there was a group of people in Mexico that had come from some other country raping and murdering, if they were white people, I'd say kill them!
[00:55:45.103 --> 00:55:46.484]  Or if they were blue people, you know?
[00:55:46.504 --> 00:55:52.888]  I mean, at a certain point, you don't care what color you are, when you're being killed and overrun, you have a right to stand up against it.
[00:55:52.908 --> 00:55:55.670]  And this is Islamic, and they prey on women, and I'm tired of it.
[00:55:56.591 --> 00:55:58.212]  We got his feedback.
[00:55:58.272 --> 00:55:59.773]  I've got to do this or we won't be on the air.
[00:56:00.976 --> 00:56:03.297]  Briefly, we've got all our best products.
[00:56:03.317 --> 00:56:05.697]  50% off on colloidal silver.
[00:56:05.717 --> 00:56:06.918]  We only do that a few times a year.
[00:56:07.758 --> 00:56:09.338]  That is Memorial Day special.
[00:56:09.578 --> 00:56:11.519]  The best high-quality colloidal silver out there.
[00:56:11.539 --> 00:56:14.019]  40% off survival shield X2.
[00:56:14.239 --> 00:56:14.720]  Unbelievable.
[00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:16.200]  30% off Supermail.
[00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:19.001]  Even though all these things were just sold out for months.
[00:56:19.321 --> 00:56:20.481]  They were all sold out.
[00:56:20.541 --> 00:56:21.381]  Supermail for months.
[00:56:21.781 --> 00:56:22.562]  X2 for weeks.
[00:56:22.902 --> 00:56:23.722]  Months on the silver.
[00:56:24.122 --> 00:56:25.282]  Sold out, but 40% off.
[00:56:25.302 --> 00:56:25.642]  Unbelievable.
[00:56:28.243 --> 00:56:30.465]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[00:56:30.685 --> 00:56:32.126]  A little bit of profit we make each order.
[00:56:32.486 --> 00:56:35.509]  We need big, big sales to make it back to fund the operation.
[00:56:35.709 --> 00:56:36.769]  So please support us today.
[00:56:37.070 --> 00:56:38.171]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:56:38.451 --> 00:56:45.016]  Emrix Essentials, the new line of organic self-care products from shampoo to sunscreen to 10 to 1 mouthwash.
[00:56:45.056 --> 00:56:45.636]  It's all there.
[00:56:45.716 --> 00:56:46.597]  Deodorant, you name it.
[00:56:46.837 --> 00:56:49.059]  Okay, let's go to Manchester.
[00:56:49.439 --> 00:56:52.461]  We're reporting from the ground is Tommy Robinson.
[00:56:53.042 --> 00:56:54.963]  Tommy, wow, tell us what you're doing, where you're going.
[00:56:56.164 --> 00:56:57.525]  Well, we're walking through the city.
[00:56:58.041 --> 00:57:07.107]  And, um, we was here today, during the day, you'll be able to see the videos going up on Rebel, um, where there was, there was, there was prompt scares everywhere.
[00:57:07.147 --> 00:57:08.388]  People running through the shopping centres.
[00:57:09.149 --> 00:57:12.391]  Even now, I think if a balloon went off, the whole city would run from fear.
[00:57:12.811 --> 00:57:13.632]  And there's a vigil.
[00:57:13.992 --> 00:57:21.858]  So, organised by Andy Burnham, who is the MP who is working with the Muslim extremist group, who shares a platform with them.
[00:57:21.898 --> 00:57:22.738]  He's organising the vigil.
[00:57:23.619 --> 00:57:25.380]  He's now the Mayor of Greater Manchester.
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:26.481]  He's in charge of the whole police force.
[00:57:27.298 --> 00:57:30.581]  So, um, yeah, he's organized a vigil for people to come together.
[00:57:30.601 --> 00:57:32.142]  This is one of the vigils which you see across.
[00:57:32.202 --> 00:57:33.644]  And so he can be the hero.
[00:57:33.664 --> 00:57:35.205]  He can know the peace.
[00:57:35.225 --> 00:57:36.426]  Let's run up white flags.
[00:57:36.727 --> 00:57:37.707]  Let me be your boss.
[00:57:37.767 --> 00:57:38.828]  Just lay down.
[00:57:39.129 --> 00:57:40.830]  Let us put the handcuffs on.
[00:57:41.111 --> 00:57:42.452]  Get in the yellow Volkswagen.
[00:57:42.712 --> 00:57:43.833]  Let us get you in the basement.
[00:57:44.253 --> 00:57:44.534]  Go ahead.
[00:57:45.731 --> 00:57:46.051]  That's it.
[00:57:46.391 --> 00:57:47.211]  That's it.
[00:57:47.311 --> 00:57:49.392]  And that's what... I didn't even know this.
[00:57:49.452 --> 00:57:52.313]  I've only just started researching Manchester since I got up here this morning.
[00:57:53.053 --> 00:57:56.914]  And again, just... I've only had to scratch beneath the surface.
[00:57:56.934 --> 00:57:59.655]  It took me 10 minutes to find things out.
[00:57:59.675 --> 00:58:05.276]  10 minutes to find things out, but I believe now, this is one of these vigils where... It doesn't do anything, does it?
[00:58:05.656 --> 00:58:07.457]  I understand the feeling of coming together.
[00:58:08.211 --> 00:58:13.074]  It's not gonna... But it makes the people that allowed it to happen look like they care about everybody on the conciliators.
[00:58:13.834 --> 00:58:15.195]  Oh, they're the people standing up there.
[00:58:15.495 --> 00:58:24.200]  They're the people that are gonna be standing up there telling us how we'll come through this, we'll stop this, while sharing a platform and appeasing the groups who are radicalizing the people in these communities.
[00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:25.921]  Tommy, how far away are you from the vigil?
[00:58:27.205 --> 00:58:28.126]  I have no idea, Alex.
[00:58:28.306 --> 00:58:30.047]  Earlier I thought you said you were pretty close.
[00:58:30.347 --> 00:58:32.049]  Four minutes, four minutes, 45 minutes.
[00:58:32.069 --> 00:58:34.290]  Hold on, we're going to come right back in 70 seconds.
[00:58:34.591 --> 00:58:36.572]  This is riveting, amazing.
[00:58:37.192 --> 00:58:42.316]  On the streets of Manchester with the man who's been imprisoned for protesting or filming Muslims.
[00:58:42.696 --> 00:58:44.298]  Because Muslims are God.
[00:58:45.819 --> 00:58:49.902]  This is the InfoWars PowerPack, and it can start your car if it has a dead battery.
[00:58:51.755 --> 00:58:54.436]  And now we're going to use the PowerPak to jumpstart this truck.
[00:58:54.836 --> 00:58:55.837]  And we're going to show you!
[00:58:56.277 --> 00:59:01.039]  Switch on the PowerPak, wait a few minutes, and then you'll be able to start your car.
[00:59:01.759 --> 00:59:06.921]  With just a few minutes on the Infowars BatteryPak, you go from a dead battery to this.
[00:59:13.516 --> 00:59:16.279]  You get all that cranking power in this little brick!
[00:59:16.559 --> 00:59:22.546]  The Infowars Power Pack is a must-have, and it'll give you peace of mind whether you're at home or on the go.
[00:59:23.146 --> 00:59:28.552]  It's so compact, it'll fit in your backpack, your glove box, or even your back pocket.
[00:59:28.952 --> 00:59:33.738]  Get one for your home, boat, car, camping setup, or just for emergencies.
[00:59:34.238 --> 00:59:44.530]  Secure your peace of mind today and order your InfoWars power pack from InfoWarsStore.com or dial 1-888-253-3139 and order today!
[00:59:47.954 --> 00:59:53.861]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[00:59:59.736 --> 01:00:03.782]  From the front lines, Tommy Robinson in Manchester's site of the terror bombing last night.
[01:00:04.645 --> 01:00:09.426]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:09.466 --> 01:00:12.847]  And you've got to look long and hard to hear him saying it's Islamic, but it is.
[01:00:12.907 --> 01:00:13.647]  They've taken credit.
[01:00:14.307 --> 01:00:16.887]  Tommy Robinson, this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[01:00:16.907 --> 01:00:27.089]  He's about three minutes away from the vigil being held by the very local leaders, reportedly, that have been working with radical Islam, protecting the mosque, protecting the people coming back as ISIS fighters.
[01:00:27.350 --> 01:00:29.050]  That's mainstream UK news.
[01:00:29.890 --> 01:00:38.257]  This is incredible, and Tommy Robinson, feel free to take over here and tell us who the crowd is that's just joined you on the street, marching with you, like right out of Fight Club.
[01:00:39.157 --> 01:00:40.558]  Yeah, they were just local English lads.
[01:00:41.139 --> 01:00:41.919]  Local English lads.
[01:00:41.939 --> 01:00:42.800]  This is their city, innit?
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:43.581]  This is their city.
[01:00:43.601 --> 01:00:47.344]  Oh, they were saying, but I saw folks that were white, that were brown, you name it, giving us thumbs up.
[01:00:48.344 --> 01:00:49.285]  Yeah, yeah, black lads, yeah.
[01:00:49.505 --> 01:00:50.326]  Yeah, that's what...
[01:00:51.121 --> 01:00:52.702]  You have to understand this whole myth.
[01:00:53.083 --> 01:00:53.463]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:00:54.183 --> 01:00:57.106]  The black community, especially where I'm from, we're like this.
[01:00:57.966 --> 01:00:58.427]  We're like this.
[01:00:59.047 --> 01:01:01.349]  When it comes to, this is an ideology that has no colour.
[01:01:01.629 --> 01:01:02.510]  This is an ideology.
[01:01:02.790 --> 01:01:06.593]  In fact, many of the most radical Muslims now are white, unfortunately, in the UK.
[01:01:07.213 --> 01:01:08.274]  Especially in the prison system.
[01:01:08.294 --> 01:01:11.657]  Well, plus, most Africans have been bombed or attacked by Muslim groups.
[01:01:11.677 --> 01:01:14.239]  They've really experienced the Islamic invasion in Africa.
[01:01:15.509 --> 01:01:17.970]  Yeah, they've embraced the country.
[01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:24.252]  As I said, my mum was an immigrant to this country, and she embraced it, and as her children we embraced it, and that's the same with them.
[01:01:24.272 --> 01:01:25.172]  They've embraced it and love it.
[01:01:26.052 --> 01:01:27.913]  But there's one section of the community who don't.
[01:01:28.273 --> 01:01:32.194]  One section of immigrants that have come here who refuse to, who are now third generation.
[01:01:32.234 --> 01:01:33.835]  I believe this man was second generation.
[01:01:34.295 --> 01:01:36.496]  But second and third generation, the problem's getting worse and worse.
[01:01:37.301 --> 01:01:38.141]  Problems getting worse and worse.
[01:01:38.161 --> 01:01:43.384]  The hatred, the pure hatred against our way of life, our culture, our history, everything about us.
[01:01:43.704 --> 01:01:49.667]  I have noticed a lot of the British leaders are white Muslims and seem to be the most aggressive.
[01:01:49.687 --> 01:01:50.388]  What's going on with that?
[01:01:51.499 --> 01:01:55.962]  Yeah, and you know what's happened is we've lost our identity as English people.
[01:01:56.463 --> 01:01:57.263]  We've lost our history.
[01:01:57.443 --> 01:02:00.926]  We've not been allowed to be proud in who we are, proud in our history or our culture.
[01:02:01.386 --> 01:02:02.747]  So there's something missing anyway.
[01:02:02.887 --> 01:02:03.928]  So Islam fills that void.
[01:02:04.448 --> 01:02:07.110]  They then join Islam and they're allowed to be proud in their identity.
[01:02:07.791 --> 01:02:14.476]  And they're given a real strong sense of belief and identity and belonging, which has been lost, purposely lost, orchestrated.
[01:02:14.676 --> 01:02:15.356]  They've done that on purpose.
[01:02:16.017 --> 01:02:18.379]  I said most English kids who are 16 are walking around with their heads down.
[01:02:19.244 --> 01:02:20.064]  We'll come out with our heads down.
[01:02:20.744 --> 01:02:25.206]  So they take culture away and then bring in either leftist globalism or Islam.
[01:02:25.506 --> 01:02:27.186]  Why do you think the left is so allied?
[01:02:27.506 --> 01:02:31.147]  Again, Tommy Robinson on the ground in Manchester investigating live.
[01:02:31.547 --> 01:02:35.028]  Why do you think that the left is so allied with Islam?
[01:02:36.669 --> 01:02:41.890]  I always say because it's the Marxists and Communists aligning with Islam and they both hate each other.
[01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:43.370]  But they're simply using each other.
[01:02:44.271 --> 01:02:45.251]  They're simply using each other.
[01:02:46.231 --> 01:02:48.952]  They're using each other and I think this is, is this where it is now?
[01:02:50.097 --> 01:02:51.557]  Will you give us a shot forward then?
[01:02:51.697 --> 01:02:52.458]  We'll still be able to hear you.
[01:02:52.478 --> 01:02:53.338]  Just go ahead and turn it around.
[01:02:53.658 --> 01:02:58.420]  Tommy Robinson reporting for a lot of great websites and a lot of great work he's doing.
[01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:04.781]  You can check him out, obviously, online at TheRebelMedia.com, TommyRobinson.co.uk, TheRebelMedia.com.
[01:03:05.001 --> 01:03:05.942]  A lot of great folks there.
[01:03:06.162 --> 01:03:08.443]  Look at that beautiful old city of Manchester.
[01:03:08.643 --> 01:03:11.643]  And this is the vigil.
[01:03:12.464 --> 01:03:15.445]  Probably be led by Muslims telling us that we should all worship them.
[01:03:16.685 --> 01:03:18.045]  Look at the gorgeous architecture there.
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:32.731]  Oh good, he's just teaching Tommy how to flip that around by hitting the, you know, wheel.
[01:03:33.111 --> 01:03:35.334]  I'm the same way, I'm not that savvy with the tech stuff.
[01:03:37.017 --> 01:03:40.778]  I love how people say, look at the Muslim architecture in Turkey.
[01:03:40.838 --> 01:03:41.899]  Oh my God, look at the Blue Mosque.
[01:03:41.919 --> 01:03:42.839]  It was built by Christians.
[01:03:43.179 --> 01:03:46.700]  I'm not saying the Muslims haven't built some amazing architecture and didn't invent a lot of science.
[01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:47.620]  That'd be a lie.
[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:53.982]  I'm just saying that the Muslims had a golden age before, especially before they were Muslims.
[01:03:54.162 --> 01:03:54.582]  1400 years ago.
[01:03:57.043 --> 01:04:02.285]  And I'm sorry folks, I was against the Iraq War, all of it, because we were overthrowing non-radical Muslims.
[01:04:03.496 --> 01:04:06.258]  I don't want to fight with the Muslims, but I cannot put up with this anymore.
[01:04:06.858 --> 01:04:09.260]  Tommy Robinson, again, reporting.
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:10.341]  We're going to go to break, my friend.
[01:04:10.361 --> 01:04:15.584]  We'll be back in three minutes, and you can take over if you want to report from the scene for folks there.
[01:04:16.185 --> 01:04:19.607]  So, again, he's approaching the vigil right now.
[01:04:19.667 --> 01:04:20.467]  We've got to go to break.
[01:04:20.487 --> 01:04:21.928]  These are hard breaks on the network.
[01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:25.691]  So, Tommy, if you want to turn it back around, get a good signal, we appreciate you.
[01:04:25.711 --> 01:04:27.092]  We'll be back to you in three minutes, okay?
[01:04:29.983 --> 01:04:30.243]  Alright.
[01:04:31.123 --> 01:04:32.224]  I guess he doesn't have his earpiece now.
[01:04:32.244 --> 01:04:33.124]  I'll ask him to turn it around.
[01:04:33.184 --> 01:04:33.904]  Let's ask him to now.
[01:04:33.944 --> 01:04:35.025]  Let him take over.
[01:04:35.485 --> 01:04:42.667]  And then Tommy will report from Manchester at the vigil that has nothing to do with Islamics attacking us last night.
[01:04:43.967 --> 01:04:45.628]  According to the media.
[01:04:46.548 --> 01:04:49.349]  According to George Soros' group.
[01:04:49.369 --> 01:04:49.929]  It's all my fault.
[01:04:50.429 --> 01:04:50.869]  We'll be back.
[01:04:50.929 --> 01:04:51.590]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:52.530]  This is the InfoWar.
[01:04:55.886 --> 01:05:01.389]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com, and this is an email from Family Gino.
[01:05:01.569 --> 01:05:08.052]  I took down my Rebel flag, which you can't buy on eBay anymore, and peeled the NRA sticker off my rear car window.
[01:05:08.252 --> 01:05:12.674]  I disconnected my home alarm system and quit the candy-ass neighborhood watch.
[01:05:12.934 --> 01:05:16.936]  I bought two Pakistani flags and put one in each corner of the front yard.
[01:05:17.096 --> 01:05:22.278]  Then I purchased the black flag of ISIS, which you can buy on eBay, and ran it up the flagpole.
[01:05:22.438 --> 01:05:29.940]  Now the local police, sheriff, FBI, CIA, NSA, Homeland Security, and other agencies are all watching my house 24-7.
[01:05:30.501 --> 01:05:36.222]  I've never felt safer, and I'm saving $69.95 a month that ADT used to charge me.
[01:05:36.382 --> 01:05:39.884]  Plus, I bought burkas for my wife and I to wear when we shop or travel.
[01:05:40.004 --> 01:05:42.745]  Everyone moves out of the way and security can't pat us down.
[01:05:42.905 --> 01:05:46.586]  If they say I'm a male wearing a burka, I just say, I'm feeling like a woman today.
[01:05:46.886 --> 01:05:47.367]  Goddamn!
[01:05:47.508 --> 01:05:48.249]  Safe at last!
[01:05:48.269 --> 01:05:49.492]  Ain't America great!
[01:05:50.054 --> 01:05:52.881]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[01:05:53.041 --> 01:05:54.003]  This is Joe Biggs.

[01:05:58.027 --> 01:05:59.347]  It's like lightning in a bottle.

[01:06:55.023 --> 01:07:04.050]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best-tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:07:04.110 --> 01:07:12.357]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:07:12.517 --> 01:07:17.201]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:07:17.381 --> 01:07:24.105]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:07:24.185 --> 01:07:31.269]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:07:31.369 --> 01:07:38.233]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:07:38.393 --> 01:07:42.736]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:07:42.876 --> 01:07:46.078]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:07:46.238 --> 01:07:47.738]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:07:47.758 --> 01:07:48.399]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:08:16.613 --> 01:08:28.984]  All right, we've had Tommy Robinson, who is a journalist and nationalist standing up for free speech and sovereignty and Christianity in the UK on with us.
[01:08:29.484 --> 01:08:37.351]  He got to the vigil there in front of the main government building in Manchester, UK, close to where Paul Watson grew up.
[01:08:38.071 --> 01:08:41.955]  And then there were so many people obviously on their cell phones that the signal degraded and we lost it.
[01:08:43.151 --> 01:08:57.475]  But we do have a live feed from the vigil, where all the usual leftist suspects that have let the Islamists stand, that have done all this, stand up there and lecture everyone.
[01:08:57.495 --> 01:08:58.996]  We're going to keep our borders open.
[01:08:59.276 --> 01:09:01.096]  We're going to bring in more military-age men.
[01:09:01.616 --> 01:09:02.917]  We're going to let them organize.
[01:09:03.317 --> 01:09:05.297]  We're going to let them sexually mutilate their daughters.
[01:09:05.557 --> 01:09:07.178]  We're going to let them put hoods on their heads.
[01:09:07.438 --> 01:09:10.519]  And we're going to submit, because we're loving
[01:09:14.056 --> 01:09:15.738]  And that's basically what gets spewed.
[01:09:15.758 --> 01:09:23.105]  Here, let's hear what they have to say right now, marching up all the controlled government churches, telling us to all just bend over to Islam.
[01:09:23.125 --> 01:09:24.086]  Here it is.
[01:09:24.126 --> 01:09:25.067]  Let's listen to this.
[01:09:31.133 --> 01:09:31.714]  That's clapping.
[01:09:37.853 --> 01:09:39.614]  Oh again, I could hear the audio earlier during the break.
[01:09:40.114 --> 01:09:43.717]  But this is, this is live coverage of what's happening there.
[01:09:44.337 --> 01:09:47.499]  Paul Watson has the latest report up on Infowars.com.
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:53.403]  You got 22 dead, mainly teenage girls that went to hear a pop rock concert.
[01:09:55.364 --> 01:09:56.885]  And you've got more than 50 injured.
[01:09:56.925 --> 01:09:59.687]  Meanwhile, London police aren't really investigating the jihadis.
[01:10:00.287 --> 01:10:03.349]  No, they've launched a free speech crackdown amid Manchester attack.
[01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:12.256]  And they say they're criminally investigating anyone that criticizes Islam or calls for investigation of Islam.
[01:10:13.218 --> 01:10:15.460]  Because this wasn't an Islamic attack.
[01:10:15.841 --> 01:10:17.603]  And they won't show you the dead bodies.
[01:10:20.005 --> 01:10:22.308]  Because they don't want you to personalize the people that were killed.
[01:10:22.328 --> 01:10:26.413]  They want to continue the Islamic invasion and the Islamic takeover.
[01:10:30.814 --> 01:10:39.278]  Now I want to go over the facts dealing with this case and play some more clips and then open the phones up so that you have a chance to respond.
[01:10:39.658 --> 01:10:45.861]  But leftists have now been bemoaning Islamophobia backlash on social media following Manchester terror attack.
[01:10:46.221 --> 01:10:53.244]  And if you watch UK or EU news, it's very hard to hear anybody calling it an Islamic attack.
[01:10:54.889 --> 01:11:00.453]  Alright, we've got some of the audio now from the Manchester Peace Rally, which means run up the white flag.
[01:11:00.493 --> 01:11:10.721]  I have stacks of news where they have anti-Islamophobia rallies in the UK and in Europe, and when the women go, they get raped at the rallies, in public, gang raped.
[01:11:11.122 --> 01:11:16.706]  And the police won't do anything because it's a sacrament to the goddess of Islam, I guess.
[01:11:17.207 --> 01:11:18.488]  I'm being sarcastic, but here it is.
[01:11:20.059 --> 01:11:29.905]  Yay!
[01:11:29.945 --> 01:11:31.386]  Let's run up the white flag!
[01:11:31.426 --> 01:11:32.547]  Yay!
[01:11:32.867 --> 01:11:37.590]  Let's have the very people that ran up the white flag come and lead us into more bondage!
[01:11:37.690 --> 01:11:38.050]  Yes!
[01:11:39.391 --> 01:11:39.811]  I love it!
[01:11:42.682 --> 01:11:57.150]  And again, it's the way that they sit there and grovel to Islam every time there's an Islamic attack and won't call it Islamic and say, we won't let this drive us apart, we will continue to worship Islam, we'll continue to have Stockholm Syndrome, we'll continue to go along with all this.
[01:11:58.611 --> 01:12:00.072]  And in that crowd is Tommy Robinson.
[01:12:01.503 --> 01:12:01.864]  Somewhere.
[01:12:02.464 --> 01:12:03.886]  We'll get him back as soon as we're able to.
[01:12:04.466 --> 01:12:15.597]  The toll-free number to join us concerning the attacks, concerning Trump's visit to the Middle East where he threw down the gauntlet to orthodox radical Islam and said, you will be destroyed, God is against you.
[01:12:16.739 --> 01:12:18.861]  Well, they responded a day later, didn't they?
[01:12:20.339 --> 01:12:27.882]  There's been reports of thousands and thousands of jihadis coming back into Europe, back into the UK, as Trump destroys Al-Qaeda and ISIS in Syria.
[01:12:28.202 --> 01:12:31.483]  There's been warnings, vet these people, check these people.
[01:12:32.924 --> 01:12:36.105]  But the UN runs the refugee program and says, sorry!
[01:12:37.246 --> 01:12:42.368]  Under international law that you've signed on to, we say who comes into your country, including the United States.
[01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:48.070]  So let's go over.
[01:12:49.813 --> 01:12:50.614]  Some of the news here.
[01:12:51.154 --> 01:13:00.202]  French President said terrorism part of our daily lives for years to come after the latest shooting in Paris of police.
[01:13:01.623 --> 01:13:06.147]  Foreign men rape molest girls in anti-racism peace and love festival.
[01:13:06.327 --> 01:13:08.409]  There's video of the women being gang raped.
[01:13:09.838 --> 01:13:19.665]  Shot by the Muslims, with them lined up, one man holds each leg, they hold the woman, they choke her, the men line up, and rape her, and rape her, and rape her, and they beg, and they beg, and they beg.
[01:13:19.886 --> 01:13:21.467]  There's hours of this footage.
[01:13:22.507 --> 01:13:33.636]  I would skip through it and just, it was so horrific, that I only showed screenshots of the women with total nightmare, hell surrender in their eyes, just like, God, why have you forsaken me?
[01:13:33.956 --> 01:13:36.698]  As they're being gang raped by the very Muslims they came to worship.
[01:13:38.199 --> 01:13:39.240]  Go watch the footage if you dare.
[01:13:43.271 --> 01:13:44.112]  Let's continue here.
[01:13:44.892 --> 01:13:45.493]  Cologne.
[01:13:45.593 --> 01:13:53.060]  Women apologize for xenophobia by giving migrant Islamicist roses following mass public molestation.
[01:13:55.122 --> 01:13:55.802]  Trump was right.
[01:13:55.862 --> 01:13:59.506]  Migrants riot, loot, fight with police, and set cars on fire in Sweden.
[01:14:00.472 --> 01:14:02.833]  It was terrible what happened last night in Sweden.
[01:14:03.573 --> 01:14:07.874]  He watched the clip the night before from three days before, and then it happened the day after he said it.
[01:14:07.914 --> 01:14:11.955]  But it didn't matter that it happened right behind the day he said and right after the day.
[01:14:12.255 --> 01:14:13.576]  They said Trump was wrong!
[01:14:15.116 --> 01:14:18.417]  You know, if Trump told you a lottery ticket number and it came up true, they'd say it was wrong.
[01:14:20.758 --> 01:14:22.178]  No, the migrants don't rape anybody.
[01:14:22.218 --> 01:14:22.918]  They don't hurt anybody.
[01:14:23.238 --> 01:14:24.119]  Islam never did anything.
[01:14:24.159 --> 01:14:25.599]  They don't put hoods over women's heads either.
[01:14:28.559 --> 01:14:34.685]  Sweden, just last week, 70-year-old woman prosecuted for complaining about migrants defecating on the streets.
[01:14:35.005 --> 01:14:36.207]  That's part of their culture, lady.
[01:14:39.650 --> 01:14:44.174]  Meanwhile, Manchester Arena suicide bombing.
[01:14:44.375 --> 01:14:48.799]  22 die in Ariana Grande concert.
[01:14:49.119 --> 01:14:49.600]  And by the way,
[01:14:51.462 --> 01:14:52.443]  People ask, what are they going to do?
[01:14:52.463 --> 01:14:53.204]  They're going to do nothing.
[01:14:53.524 --> 01:14:59.630]  They'll have checkpoints and search you and all the rest of it, but it'll be an Islamicist, you know, lets you through the back door every time.
[01:14:59.890 --> 01:15:01.953]  Hell, most of the time in the UK, they're the ones running the security.
[01:15:04.956 --> 01:15:12.843]  I love how when I fly into the UK, Muslim women and men are the ones that ask me questions and search me, and when I'm leaving, they do it.
[01:15:12.903 --> 01:15:13.985]  Every time, it's Muslims!
[01:15:14.673 --> 01:15:16.254]  And I'm like, is this a joke?
[01:15:16.674 --> 01:15:17.494]  But it's not, see?
[01:15:17.654 --> 01:15:21.156]  It's all part of the Stockholm Syndrome, all part of the cuckolding, all part of the joke.
[01:15:21.176 --> 01:15:29.439]  It'd be like if weasels or foxes were killing the hen house every night, so you hired a guard to guard it, and it was a fox.
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:31.560]  You know, fox guarding the hen house.
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:38.543]  So I'm walking up, I get the 20 questions, I get put to the ringer, I get asked why I'm here, what am I doing, what do I plan?
[01:15:38.923 --> 01:15:39.703]  Am I an extremist?
[01:15:39.744 --> 01:15:43.005]  And I'm sitting there, they know full well who I am, and I'm looking at a Muslim woman.
[01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:45.091]  Wearing a hijab.
[01:15:45.111 --> 01:15:49.736]  And I'm just like, what?
[01:15:49.996 --> 01:15:52.078]  This must be really funny to you, Cupcake.
[01:15:57.404 --> 01:15:58.185]  Manchester.
[01:15:58.805 --> 01:15:59.766]  Suicide bombing.
[01:16:00.127 --> 01:16:01.949]  22 plus dead, but that's okay.
[01:16:03.527 --> 01:16:12.596]  Then I've got all the different recent attacks, not counting the Russian one, you know, the Russian attacks we've seen don't even really get on our news, and our media's kind of like, oh, they deserve it, you know.
[01:16:13.156 --> 01:16:15.238]  Recent major terror attacks in Europe.
[01:16:15.258 --> 01:16:19.502]  Because we can't have any solidarity with Russia who's fighting Islam more than we are.
[01:16:20.443 --> 01:16:25.428]  We can't have any kinship with a nation of people that have been fighting Muslims longer than we have.
[01:16:25.488 --> 01:16:26.429]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:16:26.469 --> 01:16:28.531]  They're the enemy because they're actually fighting Muslims.
[01:16:30.313 --> 01:16:36.659]  April 7th, 2017, a man driving a hijacked beer truck struck pedestrians at Stockholm department store.
[01:16:36.939 --> 01:16:40.602]  But don't worry, they have Stockholm Syndrome, so they said it wasn't Muslim, even though it was.
[01:16:42.404 --> 01:16:48.490]  March 22nd, a man drives a rented SUV into pedestrians at London's Westminster Bridge, killing four people.
[01:16:48.530 --> 01:16:51.532]  The attacker then stabbed a police officer while screaming Allah Akbar.
[01:16:52.553 --> 01:16:53.935]  It had nothing to do with Islam.
[01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:59.722]  December 19, 2016, a hijacked truck plows through a Christian market in Berlin, killing 12.
[01:17:03.463 --> 01:17:04.804]  In fact, this must be an old list.
[01:17:04.844 --> 01:17:11.006]  This doesn't even have the police being shot in France, or the other truck attack in France.
[01:17:12.887 --> 01:17:13.487]  No, but whatever.
[01:17:14.968 --> 01:17:19.770]  July 14, a truck driver targets Bastille Day travelers at Nice, killing 86.
[01:17:19.870 --> 01:17:21.571]  It was like a video game.
[01:17:21.591 --> 01:17:22.351]  Little kids running.
[01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:24.800]  And then they just plow him over?
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:28.961]  And again, many of the people killed supported bringing in the Islamicist.
[01:17:29.862 --> 01:17:32.402]  So it's like bringing in a rattlesnake and putting it in your bed at night.
[01:17:32.682 --> 01:17:34.263]  It's your fault when it attacks you.
[01:17:34.483 --> 01:17:35.923]  I'm not blaming everybody.
[01:17:36.163 --> 01:17:37.204]  I'm not blaming the children.
[01:17:37.344 --> 01:17:40.105]  I'm blaming the cuckold, white flag culture.
[01:17:41.525 --> 01:17:43.285]  Have you looked at Al-Qaeda and ISIS's flag?
[01:17:43.385 --> 01:17:43.946]  It's black.
[01:17:44.266 --> 01:17:45.466]  That means no surrender.
[01:17:48.087 --> 01:17:52.248]  Suicide attacks on the Brussels airport and subway killed 32 and injured hundreds.
[01:17:53.615 --> 01:17:58.296]  The perpetrators have been closely linked to the group that carried out earlier attacks in Paris.
[01:17:59.276 --> 01:18:05.317]  Islamic State, November 13th, linked extremists attack a concert hall and other sites.
[01:18:05.978 --> 01:18:07.098]  I'm not going to keep reading all these.
[01:18:07.318 --> 01:18:08.158]  This is just part of them.
[01:18:09.538 --> 01:18:12.539]  Now look at all the SWAT teams that show up right after it happens, running around.
[01:18:12.559 --> 01:18:21.881]  I'm not against the individual police officers, but you leave the gates open, you bring the problem in, you protect it, and then you show up after everybody's dead and dying
[01:18:24.358 --> 01:18:25.038]  As the saviors.
[01:18:25.658 --> 01:18:33.941]  If you were really the saviors, you'd be politically active, changing what's happening in your government, and not going along with the sellout to the islamicists.
[01:18:36.882 --> 01:18:42.564]  Sick video shows ISIS jihadist ominous warning after Manchester arena blast.
[01:18:43.652 --> 01:18:45.033]  We've got time to queue that up.
[01:18:45.854 --> 01:18:46.535]  It's a short clip.
[01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:49.217]  I'm going to come back and play more clips and then go to your phone calls.
[01:18:49.437 --> 01:18:51.940]  But here's the jihadist celebrating the blast.
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:54.382]  ISIS is now officially taking credit.
[01:18:54.903 --> 01:18:57.565]  Sick video shows ISIS turd blossom.
[01:18:58.186 --> 01:19:01.148]  A jihadist make ominous warning after Manchester Arena blast.
[01:19:01.409 --> 01:19:03.451]  I'd love to get my hands on you, but I know
[01:19:03.991 --> 01:19:06.732]  You're some guy that runs around spewing your anti-Christian garbage.
[01:19:06.752 --> 01:19:07.793]  You're probably on welfare.
[01:19:08.013 --> 01:19:09.173]  You're probably in the UK.
[01:19:09.373 --> 01:19:10.614]  You're a big lazy punk.
[01:19:10.894 --> 01:19:12.715]  Probably wear gangster, you know, outfits.
[01:19:12.975 --> 01:19:14.876]  You're just, you're just the classic wimp.
[01:19:15.216 --> 01:19:25.360]  The classic guy that never had a strong man in his life who thinks being a thug to women and being a little coward makes you tough because you haven't been around real men to put you in your little cowardly place.
[01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:27.481]  Let's play a clip of this piece of garbage.
[01:19:29.392 --> 01:19:33.614]  In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Grateful, this is only the beginning.
[01:19:33.654 --> 01:19:35.616]  In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Grateful, this is only the beginning.
[01:19:35.676 --> 01:19:37.997]  In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Grateful, this is only the beginning.
[01:19:38.017 --> 01:19:40.378]  In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Grateful, this is only the beginning.
[01:19:40.398 --> 01:19:42.179]  In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Grateful, this is only the beginning.
[01:19:42.219 --> 01:19:44.360]  In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Grateful, this is only the beginning.
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:46.321]  In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Grateful, this is only the beginning.
[01:19:46.341 --> 01:19:49.143]  In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Grateful, this is only the beginning.
[01:19:49.183 --> 01:19:51.244]  In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Grateful, this is only the beginning.
[01:19:51.584 --> 01:19:54.206]  In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Grateful, this is only the beginning.
[01:19:54.226 --> 01:19:57.167]  In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Grateful, this is only the beginning.
[01:19:57.207 --> 01:19:57.748]  In the name of
[01:19:58.615 --> 01:19:58.695]  The
[01:20:17.654 --> 01:20:27.358]  That show that humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[01:20:27.498 --> 01:20:33.641]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[01:20:34.521 --> 01:20:36.382]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[01:20:37.363 --> 01:20:38.603]  People are falling apart.
[01:20:38.643 --> 01:20:39.644]  They're totally depressed.
[01:20:39.664 --> 01:20:40.204]  They're unhappy.
[01:20:40.784 --> 01:20:41.765]  What is going on?
[01:20:43.025 --> 01:20:46.907]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[01:20:48.123 --> 01:20:50.705]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[01:20:51.085 --> 01:20:52.787]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[01:20:52.987 --> 01:20:59.992]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[01:21:00.232 --> 01:21:08.539]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWars Life products.
[01:21:09.941 --> 01:21:16.469]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[01:21:16.850 --> 01:21:20.254]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[01:21:20.314 --> 01:21:23.438]  You used the skin to cover yourself for shelter.
[01:21:24.038 --> 01:21:29.124]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[01:21:29.625 --> 01:21:43.513]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric roots, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great-tasting formula.
[01:21:43.613 --> 01:21:45.074]  The bone is so amazing.
[01:21:45.474 --> 01:21:51.077]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[01:21:52.199 --> 01:21:55.141]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[01:21:55.661 --> 01:22:01.104]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[01:22:01.384 --> 01:22:10.848]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[01:22:11.129 --> 01:22:15.691]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[01:22:15.911 --> 01:22:17.711]  This is a absolute win-win.
[01:22:17.771 --> 01:22:20.552]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
[01:22:20.832 --> 01:22:26.933]  You support InfoWars and all we're doing to promote freedom and the restoration of our Republic and promotion of freedom worldwide.
[01:22:28.234 --> 01:22:36.995]  The journey towards better health and giving our bodies these amazing compounds that God created starts at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:22:37.135 --> 01:22:41.536]  Three years in the making, incredible research, and the very best ingredients.
[01:22:42.056 --> 01:22:44.657]  I'm Alex Jones, and I may not be a caveman,
[01:22:45.367 --> 01:22:48.648]  But compared to these trendies out there in the street, I'm as close as it gets.
[01:22:49.048 --> 01:22:52.529]  Join me at InfoWarsLive.com and get your caveman formula today.
[01:22:55.810 --> 01:23:00.231]  We have the new product at InfoWarsLive.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[01:23:00.291 --> 01:23:11.234]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[01:23:11.394 --> 01:23:16.316]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[01:23:16.437 --> 01:23:18.958]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[01:23:19.018 --> 01:23:20.519]  It helps detoxify.
[01:23:20.739 --> 01:23:23.560]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:28.363]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[01:23:28.383 --> 01:23:34.626]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[01:23:34.646 --> 01:23:39.968]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[01:23:40.069 --> 01:23:40.749]  I'm taking it now.
[01:23:41.049 --> 01:23:41.490]  Every day.
[01:23:41.690 --> 01:23:42.411]  This is so key.
[01:23:42.671 --> 01:23:44.974]  BioTrue Selenium is the product.
[01:23:45.235 --> 01:23:46.977]  The best selenium that we could bring you.
[01:23:46.997 --> 01:23:49.100]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:52.685]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:24:26.631 --> 01:24:32.653]  Live from the future Islamic caliphate of the United States of America, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:24:34.074 --> 01:24:35.994]  That's where this stuff's going, I'm telling you.
[01:24:36.054 --> 01:24:41.396]  You go to the mall now, it's just the main signs are hajibs, and just how wonderful it is.
[01:24:41.416 --> 01:24:46.978]  Even though there's really no market in that, and Muslims are a very small part of our population, we're being conditioned to accept it.
[01:24:47.498 --> 01:24:49.019]  Whether it's the Islamicist mayor,
[01:24:50.177 --> 01:24:58.079]  of London, or whether it's the new pretty boy appointed into power there in France, Macron, it doesn't matter.
[01:24:58.139 --> 01:25:04.281]  The same message over and over again is, we must get used to Islamic terror attacks and accept it.
[01:25:06.141 --> 01:25:09.342]  It's part of being a great global city, a great global order.
[01:25:09.402 --> 01:25:15.044]  It's the same talking points, the same agenda, because the Muslims have six kids on average,
[01:25:16.650 --> 01:25:19.152]  The West was induced to have 1.3 children.
[01:25:19.792 --> 01:25:21.954]  So the globalists say they're replacing us with Islam.
[01:25:23.575 --> 01:25:24.676]  Okay, well, here's the deal.
[01:25:26.737 --> 01:25:35.924]  I don't want to have to put hoods over my daughter's faces or cut their genitals off or not let them drive cars and have them have huge spy grids that are used to spy on everybody, run by the Muslims.
[01:25:35.984 --> 01:25:37.225]  I mean, this is just crazy.
[01:25:38.085 --> 01:25:41.768]  But here's the little arrogant mayor helping bring in Sharia law.
[01:25:42.028 --> 01:25:43.869]  He says, quote, he's not an Uncle Tom.
[01:25:44.270 --> 01:25:44.790]  That's a quote.
[01:25:44.830 --> 01:25:46.031]  He's going to bring in Islam.
[01:25:49.752 --> 01:25:51.654]  Here he is talking about just getting used to bombings.
[01:25:51.935 --> 01:25:54.218]  Now by the way,
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:10.681]  When I say the UK police are to blame, I don't mean the average cop.
[01:26:10.701 --> 01:26:12.642]  The media will say he said the average cop was to blame.
[01:26:12.662 --> 01:26:15.043]  No, I mean the bureaucrats, the politicians, the system.
[01:26:15.423 --> 01:26:17.264]  But you've actually got to hand it to the Manchester police.
[01:26:17.644 --> 01:26:18.965]  They said this is a terror attack.
[01:26:19.885 --> 01:26:22.106]  And they go on to say it's connected to an Islamic extremist.
[01:26:23.166 --> 01:26:25.367]  That is a revolutionary act of the UK.
[01:26:25.727 --> 01:26:31.650]  Because if you watch the news there, we had Tommy Robinson on earlier, live from Manchester, you have to dig to find that.
[01:26:31.710 --> 01:26:32.790]  They will not say it.
[01:26:34.291 --> 01:26:36.472]  Now, I've got a bunch of clips I want to get to here, but
[01:26:38.638 --> 01:26:44.109]  A big one that's really, really important is this clip of the president.
[01:26:45.819 --> 01:26:53.284]  In his response to the attack, and then you can look at what he said the day before in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where he declared them cowards.
[01:26:53.764 --> 01:26:55.085]  He said, stop what you're doing.
[01:26:55.165 --> 01:27:03.871]  And then their response was, we're going to go to a teenager girl pop place where the girls are taught to be trendy.
[01:27:03.891 --> 01:27:04.752]  They're taught to be liberal.
[01:27:04.772 --> 01:27:05.832]  They're taught to have open borders.
[01:27:06.073 --> 01:27:07.453]  They're taught to accept the Muslims.
[01:27:07.834 --> 01:27:08.674]  They're taught all this.
[01:27:08.734 --> 01:27:09.635]  It's not their fault.
[01:27:09.735 --> 01:27:10.716]  It's the state's fault.
[01:27:11.016 --> 01:27:12.037]  It's the government's fault.
[01:27:12.297 --> 01:27:15.259]  It's the adult trendies that are undoubtedly there overseeing this.
[01:27:16.179 --> 01:27:19.361]  That just keeps saying everything's fine, everything's fine, capitulate, capitulate.
[01:27:21.042 --> 01:27:22.723]  When everything's not fine.
[01:27:22.803 --> 01:27:24.905]  These poor girls have nobody to stand up for them.
[01:27:26.226 --> 01:27:38.713]  In fact, the men are so unmanly now in many cucked European countries that the women are going for Islam because they think having a guy that wipes his butt with his hand and wears a, you know, outfit, but tells us, shut up, get in there and cook me, slave!
[01:27:39.794 --> 01:27:44.057]  They think that's manly because Western men have become such cucks.
[01:27:46.161 --> 01:27:47.062]  So here is the President.
[01:27:48.183 --> 01:28:04.298]  I extend my deepest condolences to those so terribly injured in this terrorist attack and to the many killed and the families, so many families of the victims.
[01:28:05.799 --> 01:28:11.585]  We stand in absolute solidarity with the people of the United Kingdom.
[01:28:13.291 --> 01:28:23.434]  So many young, beautiful, innocent people living and enjoying their lives murdered by evil losers in life.
[01:28:25.614 --> 01:28:30.676]  I won't call them monsters because they would like that term.
[01:28:32.836 --> 01:28:34.237]  They would think that's a great name.
[01:28:37.238 --> 01:28:41.619]  I will call them, from now on, losers.
[01:28:43.376 --> 01:28:45.557]  Because that's what they are, they're losers.
[01:28:47.638 --> 01:28:48.598]  And we'll have more of them.
[01:28:49.779 --> 01:28:51.700]  But they're losers, just remember that.
[01:28:55.802 --> 01:29:00.304]  This is what I've spent these last few days talking about during my trip overseas.
[01:29:01.525 --> 01:29:08.668]  Our society can have no tolerance for this continuation of bloodshed.
[01:29:10.498 --> 01:29:16.563]  We cannot stand a moment longer for the slaughter of innocent people.
[01:29:18.944 --> 01:29:24.148]  And in today's attack, it was mostly innocent children.
[01:29:25.750 --> 01:29:32.995]  The terrorists and extremists and those who give them aid and comfort must be driven out from our society forever.
[01:29:34.757 --> 01:29:36.418]  This wicked ideology
[01:29:37.355 --> 01:29:38.456]  Must be obliterated.
[01:29:38.656 --> 01:29:39.697]  That's right, we're gonna be back.
[01:29:39.757 --> 01:29:41.117]  And I mean completely obliterated.
[01:29:41.137 --> 01:29:42.038]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:47.622]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:48.542 --> 01:29:51.224]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:55.743 --> 01:30:01.548]  In ancient times, man roamed the earth in a constant state of hunting or being hunted.

[01:30:11.016 --> 01:30:21.660]  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:30:21.980 --> 01:30:28.763]  That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.
[01:30:29.023 --> 01:30:38.147]  That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government.
[01:30:39.807 --> 01:30:41.328]  Independence isn't a day.
[01:30:41.609 --> 01:30:42.409]  It's a mindset.
[01:30:42.649 --> 01:30:45.312]  An attitude that says, I will not be your dependent.
[01:30:45.412 --> 01:30:46.753]  I will not be your slave.
[01:30:47.033 --> 01:30:52.557]  Dependence and slavery is a chain that is forged link by link with gradual infringements.
[01:30:53.098 --> 01:30:57.341]  When you trade your liberty for safety, to that extent, you become their slave.
[01:30:58.062 --> 01:30:59.523]  Slaves are never safe.
[01:30:59.963 --> 01:31:02.265]  You won't get rich by being a slave.
[01:31:02.946 --> 01:31:03.646]  Guard your liberty.
[01:31:04.047 --> 01:31:06.789]  Regard with suspicion anyone who tries to take it.
[01:31:07.369 --> 01:31:09.291]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.

[01:33:00.484 --> 01:33:02.547]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:02.607 --> 01:33:06.872]  Because there is a war on, or you're mine.
[01:33:07.192 --> 01:33:11.337]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[01:33:11.417 --> 01:33:15.402]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[01:33:16.263 --> 01:33:19.107]  Even your emotions have an echo in so much space.
[01:33:35.305 --> 01:33:42.229]  All right, Dr. Corsi's popping in for about 10 minutes.
[01:33:42.269 --> 01:33:45.071]  Then we're going to go to your phone calls right into the next hour.
[01:33:46.272 --> 01:33:57.698]  We have Dr. Mercola joining us with some huge, huge developments on so many fronts with all these massive studies coming out confirming much of his research and other researchers' intel.
[01:33:57.718 --> 01:33:57.758]  800-259-9231.
[01:34:03.234 --> 01:34:07.455]  259-9231 is the toll-free number for you to join us.
[01:34:08.055 --> 01:34:09.816]  I've got some other clubs I want to play as well.
[01:34:10.496 --> 01:34:11.556]  Obviously, we just tuned in.
[01:34:11.596 --> 01:34:26.221]  You already know about the 22 dead, over 50 injured in a suicide bombing in Manchester, England, at a girls' college-slash-high school-level pop-rock concert.
[01:34:27.701 --> 01:34:31.042]  And I'm not even so much angry at Islam, because it is what it is.
[01:34:32.301 --> 01:34:33.662]  I'm not mad at the AIDS virus.
[01:34:33.802 --> 01:34:34.343]  It is what it is.
[01:34:34.383 --> 01:34:36.584]  I'm not mad at a crocodile that eats a small child.
[01:34:36.965 --> 01:34:38.045]  A crocodile's a crocodile.
[01:34:38.085 --> 01:34:40.727]  I'm not mad at a black widow that bites somebody and kills them.
[01:34:40.767 --> 01:34:41.428]  It's a black widow.
[01:34:42.609 --> 01:34:47.813]  I'm not mad at a tornado that goes through the neighborhood and kills some people.
[01:34:47.853 --> 01:34:48.754]  That's what tornadoes do.
[01:34:50.035 --> 01:34:58.161]  It's that letting Islamists in from the most radical, out-of-control areas of the world, where they're literally
[01:34:59.824 --> 01:35:13.206]  The most bizarre cult the planet's ever seen, where women can't go outside without a male attendant, where women wear total hoods over their heads, where women can't drive cars, where women can be raped, and if they report it, they get charged with a sex crime?
[01:35:14.747 --> 01:35:25.109]  And then to be lectured by feminists all day how I'm a bad Western man, when the West is where women got empowered, and where slavery got ended, except in Islamic countries.
[01:35:25.169 --> 01:35:26.669]  Many Islamic countries still have slavery.
[01:35:28.404 --> 01:35:29.965]  People go, oh well that's their culture.
[01:35:30.366 --> 01:35:32.207]  Let's all go as liberals to the hookah bar.
[01:35:33.348 --> 01:35:38.733]  So there's this weird liberal fascination with the most radical orthodox forms of Islam.
[01:35:38.753 --> 01:35:45.178]  I know Dr. Corsi worked in counter-terrorism with the State Department and other areas and is an expert on radical Islam.
[01:35:45.758 --> 01:35:48.661]  But that's not why he's about to join us in a moment, but I'm sure he'll be able to speak to that.
[01:35:50.162 --> 01:35:55.687]  But I'm really mad at the elites that have opened the door up to do this and that would make an alliance
[01:35:59.073 --> 01:36:07.721]  With people that absolutely are more barbarous than most cultures were 5,000, 6,000 years ago.
[01:36:08.181 --> 01:36:18.290]  I mean, modern Islam was formed out of the slave trade and camel caravan routes that came through Mecca.
[01:36:20.812 --> 01:36:24.756]  And is the worst of the worst of the worst of the worst.
[01:36:25.805 --> 01:36:32.314]  And is absolutely the most criminal, reprobate, twisted, bizarre rationale for pure evil.
[01:36:34.076 --> 01:36:39.905]  It is the most monotheistic, chauvinistic thing on earth.
[01:36:41.670 --> 01:36:43.090]  I don't like extreme liberalism.
[01:36:43.210 --> 01:36:44.971]  I don't like extreme, you know, Islam.
[01:36:45.671 --> 01:36:59.115]  America is, like, way towards liberalism under Thomas Jefferson, and the very liberals then criticize us all day from a position of ignorance because they get off on the power trip of thinking, hey, here comes Islam.
[01:36:59.336 --> 01:37:00.436]  They're the muscle we need.
[01:37:01.296 --> 01:37:10.059]  How many videos have you seen at college campuses where they'll just declare the entire commons, entire parks are off limits to anybody that's white?
[01:37:11.476 --> 01:37:18.480]  But then you'll notice it's white professors, almost universally, that are leading the minorities that they're taking over from whitey.
[01:37:19.660 --> 01:37:21.041]  It's classic case of Animal Farm.
[01:37:22.562 --> 01:37:23.122]  George Orwell.
[01:37:24.042 --> 01:37:32.607]  And then they'll walk over to camera people that are coming over, with cameras, and they'll say, get out of here, and start shoving them.
[01:37:34.557 --> 01:37:38.298]  And then the man says no, and she goes, that's it, get me some muscle.
[01:37:39.018 --> 01:37:44.699]  And she goes over and tries to find a big black guy to come over and physically attack the white guy, and the black guy won't even do it.
[01:37:46.299 --> 01:37:51.080]  It's like weird beta women wanting to wage war, is what I found.
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:52.020]  That's what feminism is.
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:59.882]  But then they go to the most twisted, crazy alpha male, but it's not alpha male, it's like a weird twisted
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:01.760]  Alpha male.
[01:38:01.820 --> 01:38:04.923]  It's like a little disgruntled, twisted, chicken-necked alpha male.
[01:38:05.423 --> 01:38:12.848]  Real cowardly, and hateful, and oppressive, and greedy, and backwards, and smelly.
[01:38:13.289 --> 01:38:16.311]  And by smelly, I mean just the whole thing.
[01:38:17.391 --> 01:38:19.213]  Just has a cultural stench to it.
[01:38:19.853 --> 01:38:22.575]  And it's the worst forms of Islam that are taking over Islam.
[01:38:22.835 --> 01:38:30.701]  It always wants to take over any nice city, or nice culture, or nice art, and burn it down, blow it up, take her by the sports stadium, hang them by their necks.
[01:38:34.585 --> 01:38:36.386]  Yeah, let's play this clip of this, like, let's back it up.
[01:38:37.067 --> 01:38:38.768]  Yeah, can somebody get me some muscle?
[01:38:39.789 --> 01:38:43.452]  She's attacking him, he's attacking his camera, because she's the god now!
[01:38:43.812 --> 01:38:44.813]  She rules!
[01:38:45.353 --> 01:38:46.314]  You will submit!
[01:38:46.334 --> 01:38:48.276]  We're going to Dr. Corsi here in just a moment.
[01:38:50.277 --> 01:38:51.938]  Dealing with a total media hysteria.
[01:38:52.907 --> 01:38:55.489]  Over us getting some press passes, which aren't even the reason we're in D.C.
[01:38:55.509 --> 01:38:59.111]  We're there for interviews, they're for our sources, they're for the press club.
[01:38:59.131 --> 01:39:04.674]  Of course, he's constantly at the press meetings of the different agencies of Congress, breaking big news on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
[01:39:05.355 --> 01:39:12.179]  It's almost a hassle for him to go get the things and then go sit there all day hoping to get a question in, when it might take you a month to do it.
[01:39:12.219 --> 01:39:16.902]  But they just keep trying to keep us out of the White House, this symbol of, we're not real news.
[01:39:17.622 --> 01:39:20.124]  So we got the week-long press pass, they're flipping out about it.
[01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:22.880]  We're going to talk about that in a moment.
[01:39:23.081 --> 01:39:29.783]  But first, we've had six of our best-selling products sold out.
[01:39:30.584 --> 01:39:33.225]  Some of it for a month, some for two months, some products for two weeks.
[01:39:34.626 --> 01:39:35.426]  And that's not a good thing.
[01:39:36.186 --> 01:39:45.530]  But we have such high-quality standards that are at California level, that almost nobody else can pass, that it's hard to get the ingredients that are 100% pure.
[01:39:46.151 --> 01:39:48.792]  But we always wait until we actually get the pure batches.
[01:39:50.151 --> 01:39:53.012]  So everything is back in now, except the NA Forks.
[01:39:53.492 --> 01:39:56.752]  Everything is back in at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:39:59.793 --> 01:40:05.014]  And out of the gates for the Memorial Day Special, we have the Mega Specials.
[01:40:05.414 --> 01:40:08.494]  This is undoubtedly one of the biggest sales we've ever done.
[01:40:09.815 --> 01:40:13.155]  Silver Bullet, colloidal silver, 65% off.
[01:40:13.255 --> 01:40:14.376]  I was saying 50% off.
[01:40:18.396 --> 01:40:20.258]  I'm sorry, it's 65% off.
[01:40:20.298 --> 01:40:24.261]  We've never done 65, so when I saw that earlier, I said 50 in my own brain.
[01:40:26.303 --> 01:40:27.104]  It's a loss leader.
[01:40:27.144 --> 01:40:27.904]  We want you to have it.
[01:40:27.924 --> 01:40:29.125]  We want you to enjoy the product.
[01:40:29.145 --> 01:40:33.849]  We want you to, a lot of you that haven't ever gone and shopped with us to support the broadcast, now is the time.
[01:40:34.170 --> 01:40:35.691]  More than ever, we're under free speech attack.
[01:40:35.931 --> 01:40:36.732]  We're being demonized.
[01:40:36.752 --> 01:40:37.773]  They're trying to shut us down.
[01:40:37.793 --> 01:40:40.735]  Quite frankly, these have been sold out for a while.
[01:40:40.755 --> 01:40:42.217]  We can sell these all at full retail.
[01:40:44.072 --> 01:40:45.934]  I want to have a win-win here.
[01:40:46.014 --> 01:40:48.677]  I want you to get the Colloidal Silver at 65% off.
[01:40:49.137 --> 01:40:53.801]  Supermail Vitality, our best seller, 30% off, out of the gates, gone for months.
[01:40:54.262 --> 01:40:58.245]  Survival Shield, X2, nascent iodine, back in stock, 40% off.
[01:41:00.455 --> 01:41:03.637]  Brain Force, 47% off!
[01:41:04.217 --> 01:41:06.519]  Secret 12, 43% off!
[01:41:06.919 --> 01:41:09.841]  Pure Organic Vitamin B12, Methylcobalamin, under the tongue.
[01:41:10.201 --> 01:41:11.382]  It's the next best thing to shots.
[01:41:12.103 --> 01:41:13.844]  Knockout, 50% off retail.
[01:41:14.864 --> 01:41:15.525]  Unbelievable!
[01:41:17.006 --> 01:41:20.268]  All InfoWars t-shirts, all 75% off.
[01:41:20.288 --> 01:41:23.190]  But that only runs through next Tuesday.
[01:41:24.784 --> 01:41:27.106]  Super Blue High-Quality Fluoride-Free Toothpaste.
[01:41:28.047 --> 01:41:29.168]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:41:29.248 --> 01:41:30.329]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:41:30.649 --> 01:41:31.430]  Read the reviews.
[01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:33.832]  Here's one for Super Mel Vitality from Carson.
[01:41:34.252 --> 01:41:35.093]  Totally worth it!
[01:41:35.213 --> 01:41:36.034]  I love this product.
[01:41:36.074 --> 01:41:38.536]  Many people say they could feel it help in a couple of days.
[01:41:38.576 --> 01:41:39.617]  For me, it took a couple of weeks.
[01:41:40.258 --> 01:41:42.139]  After it got in my system, it was a game-changer.
[01:41:42.279 --> 01:41:47.544]  If you're on the fence about buying this product, I hope it will help you in so many ways.
[01:41:48.565 --> 01:41:49.265]  Five-star review.
[01:41:50.416 --> 01:41:53.598]  Z-Shield, our new product to detoxify heavy metals, other compounds.
[01:41:53.658 --> 01:41:54.479]  It's now available.
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:42:00.343]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:42:00.584 --> 01:42:07.209]  And listen, I get up here and I come off as brash and aggressive because I'm exhausted most of the time.
[01:42:07.269 --> 01:42:11.011]  I'm working until 7, 8, 9, 10 at night because I'm committed to the truth.
[01:42:12.065 --> 01:42:13.126]  Not because I'm even an angel.
[01:42:13.646 --> 01:42:18.008]  I fundamentally do not want to be dominated by globalists or by islamicists or by anybody else.
[01:42:18.108 --> 01:42:19.149]  I have a fighting spirit.
[01:42:19.269 --> 01:42:20.670]  I know you have one as well.
[01:42:21.310 --> 01:42:25.612]  And it upsets me to see muslims attack people on a weekly basis who are innocent.
[01:42:25.953 --> 01:42:30.095]  I mean, if you hate our military and hate our policies, why don't you go attack a military base?
[01:42:30.755 --> 01:42:32.216]  Why don't you go attack a police station?
[01:42:32.236 --> 01:42:33.176]  I'm not saying do that.
[01:42:33.497 --> 01:42:35.618]  I'm just saying that's called being more chivalrous.
[01:42:37.196 --> 01:42:44.023]  And it's fundamentally to see a bunch of weird leftists defending it and attacking us makes me angry.
[01:42:44.123 --> 01:42:50.749]  If you'll just support us and just buy the products, you get auto-ship, get 10% off, free shipping on orders for $50 or more.
[01:42:52.526 --> 01:42:57.949]  If you'll just make the commitment to get great products on a routine basis, that's why AutoShip's good, because I tend to forget my own products.
[01:42:57.969 --> 01:42:59.990]  Because I get them out of the warehouse myself and I'll run out.
[01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:06.213]  So I've actually ordered my own products now, online, used AutoShip, and then FortWorthStore.com, so I don't forget.
[01:43:06.313 --> 01:43:06.974]  Works like a charm.
[01:43:08.254 --> 01:43:09.635]  Because I'm busy and I'm always at home.
[01:43:10.035 --> 01:43:11.616]  Oh, I need some coiled silver, I got a sore throat.
[01:43:11.756 --> 01:43:20.881]  Or, oh, I ran out of Secret 12 for my kids, or I ran out of our own, you know, multivitamin, vitamin mineral fusion fruit punch drink.

[01:43:50.424 --> 01:43:52.025]  By the way, this is all organic.
[01:43:52.485 --> 01:43:55.587]  I'm so proud of Emerix Essentials, but take advantage of the mega
[01:43:56.434 --> 01:44:00.135]  Memorial Day sales for all our veterans and all the Patriots out there.
[01:44:00.615 --> 01:44:02.895]  Take advantage of these products and sign up for AutoShip.

[01:44:11.817 --> 01:44:20.158]  Now, we've got callers from Scotland, callers from Maryland, from Germany, from Indiana, from all over the country, all over the world.
[01:44:20.178 --> 01:44:21.739]  We're going to be going to your phone calls here in a few minutes.
[01:44:22.279 --> 01:44:23.079]  But I wanted to get
[01:44:24.059 --> 01:44:31.326]  Dr. Jerome Corsi on with us to give us his first snapshot on what happened 24 hours after the President's speech in Riyadh.
[01:44:31.386 --> 01:44:35.970]  I thought a bold speech that he called out radical Islam to its face.
[01:44:37.471 --> 01:44:41.094]  And then to see this attack and then ISIS and Al Qaeda saying a lot more coming.
[01:44:41.495 --> 01:44:43.216]  What is the EU thinking Dr. Corsi?
[01:44:43.256 --> 01:44:48.901]  You're a terrorism expert for those that don't know that they're accelerating as ISIS gets defeated by Trump.
[01:44:49.781 --> 01:44:50.121]  Absolutely.
[01:44:50.141 --> 01:44:54.664]  I mean, you've got a situation right now where the UK is trying to take control of its borders back again from the EU.
[01:45:15.225 --> 01:45:29.590]  But if you look at the EU in Brussels, you've got unelected bureaucrats, globalists, who are insisting that all the countries of the EU have open borders and are being inundated with these refugees.
[01:45:30.251 --> 01:45:38.174]  This attack in London was from, I believe, a Lebanon family of refugees that has come into the UK.
[01:45:39.334 --> 01:45:54.102]  The UK says there's 3,500 known terrorists, radical Islamic terrorists, in the UK right now, and the laws that they've been operating under really tie the hands of the police from doing anything to protect the people.
[01:45:54.582 --> 01:45:58.825]  Sure, and just to be clear, it was being confirmed now of living in refugees.
[01:45:58.865 --> 01:45:59.105]  Go ahead.
[01:46:00.123 --> 01:46:01.563]  Libyan refugees, alright.
[01:46:02.104 --> 01:46:03.064]  Libyan refugees.
[01:46:03.104 --> 01:46:16.928]  Well, I mean, again, Libya has been destroyed by Hillary Clinton when she devastated the country siding with Al-Qaeda terrorists to oust Qaddafi.
[01:46:17.008 --> 01:46:21.069]  The country has degenerated into a terrorist-controlled bedlam.
[01:46:22.993 --> 01:46:29.763]  And people can get out or are getting out, but the radical Islamic terrorists who get out bring the radical Islamic terror with them.
[01:46:29.823 --> 01:46:33.849]  And that's the problem we're having right now in the UK and all across Europe.
[01:46:34.804 --> 01:46:44.506]  And it's not going to be resolved by politicians wishing that everyone would just get along, or this Islamophobia political correctness.
[01:46:45.106 --> 01:47:01.850]  Because this situation, as Donald Trump is pointing out, in this historic trip, is going to need the cooperation, in fact a reformation of Islam, in order to reject these radicals and to define that the religion is not encouraging violence.
[01:47:02.350 --> 01:47:04.051]  That's like a reformation that the
[01:47:04.691 --> 01:47:08.993]  Various Christian churches went through in the Renaissance and afterwards.
[01:47:09.594 --> 01:47:10.394]  It's gotta happen.
[01:47:10.414 --> 01:47:14.856]  You know, the Protestant Reformation was a major reformulation.
[01:47:14.876 --> 01:47:16.777]  Yeah, where is Islam's Martin Luther?
[01:47:17.157 --> 01:47:19.278]  And meanwhile, we don't just demonize George Soros.
[01:47:19.338 --> 01:47:20.759]  As usual, he's the one behind it.
[01:47:21.219 --> 01:47:32.405]  And the Human Refugee Program, with these big, long boats, enticing the Libyans to flee to get on these big 100-foot boats that they then run them into the Italian coast.
[01:47:34.714 --> 01:47:37.276]  It's a huge problem, and people die on these boats.
[01:47:37.316 --> 01:47:39.757]  These boats are not stable.
[01:47:40.318 --> 01:47:42.559]  People drown when these boats tip over.
[01:47:42.619 --> 01:47:48.863]  So the EU goes in with Hillary, blows up Libya, then millions start pouring out, and then we're supposed to just take them all?
[01:47:50.043 --> 01:47:52.225]  Yeah, the EU wants all of them taken.
[01:47:52.245 --> 01:48:03.992]  The EU says, you XYZ country, you're going to be allocated so many of them, and if you want to have a EU passport, you want to be able to have free open borders, then you take the refugees we're giving you.
[01:48:04.821 --> 01:48:06.242]  And it's just not working out.
[01:48:06.302 --> 01:48:19.193]  I mean, in all these countries, Sweden, Germany, you've got Muslim rapes, you've got Muslim murderers, you've got Muslim no-go zones where the police are, that's too dangerous even for the police to go through.
[01:48:19.213 --> 01:48:20.474]  I've got statistics.
[01:48:20.494 --> 01:48:21.915]  90% of shootings in Sweden, Muslims.
[01:48:21.935 --> 01:48:24.137]  82% of Muslims doing the raping.
[01:48:24.397 --> 01:48:27.200]  I mean, they literally, it's like they're from another world.
[01:48:28.783 --> 01:48:41.611]  Well, the whole culture, I mean, the whole culture of this radical Islam, which is so dramatically anti-women, I mean, it's always amazed me that the American feminists... In fact, you can say, I mean, isn't Islam number one about oppressing women?
[01:48:41.651 --> 01:48:43.312]  Isn't that the real heart of Islam?
[01:48:44.967 --> 01:48:54.991]  It's certainly core to the attraction of Islam across the world and this brutalizing of women is basically medieval.
[01:48:55.431 --> 01:48:58.593]  I mean the sexual mutilation of girls is horrendous.
[01:48:59.553 --> 01:49:02.454]  The beating of women, the way women are treated.
[01:49:02.514 --> 01:49:06.216]  I mean if anyone's ever been in the Middle East and actually seen the women,
[01:49:06.796 --> 01:49:12.323]  Doctor, I see this now at malls in Austin, not just at jibs.
[01:49:12.343 --> 01:49:14.045]  I'm seeing women covered up.
[01:49:14.286 --> 01:49:17.309]  You talk about almost having a heart attack.
[01:49:25.290 --> 01:49:25.430]  Right.
[01:49:25.470 --> 01:49:27.471]  I mean, it's a pretty frightening scene.
[01:49:27.531 --> 01:49:30.831]  I mean, because these women are completely subjugated.
[01:49:30.851 --> 01:49:34.132]  They're going to be beaten if they violate any rules.
[01:49:34.212 --> 01:49:36.833]  They can be, you know, divorced.
[01:49:37.733 --> 01:49:39.733]  If they're raped, it's their fault.
[01:49:40.834 --> 01:49:45.695]  The laws of Islam and Sharia law are brutal to women.
[01:49:46.275 --> 01:49:53.977]  And it's impossible for me to understand why feminists support Islam when it is so horrendously brutal to women.
[01:49:54.737 --> 01:49:56.758]  And this is where the reformation is needed.
[01:49:56.778 --> 01:50:05.760]  You saw when President Trump was in Saudi Arabia, Melania Trump and Ivanka Trump did not wear headscarves.
[01:50:06.260 --> 01:50:10.101]  This was revolutionary in the Islamic world.
[01:50:10.161 --> 01:50:11.861]  These changes have got to happen.
[01:50:12.361 --> 01:50:19.743]  Islam is going to have to allow women to be treated as human beings and ultimately equals of
[01:50:20.343 --> 01:50:27.307]  Men, because this is fundamental to the way the earth is, and cultures have evolved to a higher level.
[01:50:27.347 --> 01:50:29.648]  But I was about to say, I've studied anthropology, so have you.
[01:50:30.168 --> 01:50:32.389]  Most cultures didn't oppress women ever like this.
[01:50:32.409 --> 01:50:34.090]  A lot of cultures, women ran things.
[01:50:34.130 --> 01:50:41.834]  I mean, this is just... I don't want folks to think that societies 2,000, 3,000 years ago treated women like this on average.
[01:50:42.094 --> 01:50:47.176]  I mean, what Muslims do today in Orthodox Muslim countries is the worst treatment of women in history.
[01:50:47.376 --> 01:50:48.577]  I mean, don't you agree with that historically?
[01:50:50.794 --> 01:50:53.275]  We'll be right back to get more with him.
[01:50:53.475 --> 01:50:54.576]  Stay with us, there's audio cut out.
[01:50:58.057 --> 01:51:12.384]  So Matt, get back into the parallel or the allegory or the example of the tectonic plates of societal systems and incompatible cultural systems and religious systems colliding.
[01:51:13.284 --> 01:51:13.764]  Matt Bracken.
[01:51:14.205 --> 01:51:17.086]  I've thought of a new kind of analogy for where we are right now.
[01:51:18.441 --> 01:51:21.122]  Last year I was talking about, like, tsunami wave warnings.
[01:51:21.983 --> 01:51:28.746]  And right now I think what we're seeing is a huge social tectonic plate about to rupture.
[01:51:29.326 --> 01:51:46.154]  Because, you know, from the 50s with Joe McCarthy being demonized through Walter Cronkite, who was a globalist, but pretending to be, you know, the most trusted man in America, all the way until, I guess, Dan Rather and MemoGate was when the new media was able to push back.
[01:51:46.818 --> 01:51:48.319]  Now they can't control the narrative.
[01:51:48.859 --> 01:51:50.701]  So now there are forces in two directions.
[01:51:51.461 --> 01:51:57.865]  They can't just turn this country into like Mao's China, even though our college students are that brainwashed.
[01:51:58.406 --> 01:52:03.429]  They are as brainwashed as the Cultural Revolution, you know, Mao's Little Red Book.
[01:52:03.769 --> 01:52:06.011]  If they could, they would put us in re-education camps.
[01:52:06.611 --> 01:52:09.654]  But we're too strong and we have our own new media now.
[01:52:10.174 --> 01:52:13.897]  So what we're seeing now are two tectonic plates.
[01:52:14.597 --> 01:52:19.281]  And things like Berkeley, riots, are little precursor shocks.
[01:52:19.601 --> 01:52:23.204]  We're about to have the big rupture, the big slip fault rupture.
[01:52:23.364 --> 01:52:25.766]  But neither one of us is going to win.
[01:52:25.886 --> 01:52:29.469]  So it's not about, I don't see us as winning the culture war.
[01:52:29.529 --> 01:52:30.650]  What we are going to do though,
[01:52:31.230 --> 01:52:31.811]  We're good.
[01:52:48.412 --> 01:52:49.153]  We're good to go.
[01:53:03.320 --> 01:53:03.740]  The stabbing?
[01:53:19.154 --> 01:53:29.465]  It's super important because this is not, as far as we can tell, a Muslim-inspired stabbing attack, but a left BLM brainwashed person.
[01:53:29.525 --> 01:53:31.307]  Sure, and this happened in and around the communists.
[01:53:31.327 --> 01:53:34.069]  And let me just add, our reporters were there, even got footage of him.
[01:53:35.110 --> 01:53:51.163]  The media covered this up, but the Antifa, we were interviewing these people, they were literally, and I'm not being mean about autism, but they literally were like half lobotomized, seriously mentally retarded it seemed, could hardly talk, and were like zombies out of a movie.
[01:53:52.363 --> 01:53:53.444]  And that was the leaders!
[01:54:10.350 --> 01:54:14.737]  Okay, Terrence in Scotland, Jason in Germany, O'Brien, Dan, Cindy.
[01:54:15.017 --> 01:54:16.059]  We're going to go to all of you here.
[01:54:16.119 --> 01:54:17.541]  Dr. Corsi's our guest right now.
[01:54:17.982 --> 01:54:25.013]  The main reason I got him on this morning is we were approached by folks in the White House at the inauguration saying, hey, who's your White House correspondent going to be?
[01:54:26.087 --> 01:54:27.128]  And they already thought I had a D.C.
[01:54:27.228 --> 01:54:27.528]  office.
[01:54:27.588 --> 01:54:29.029]  And I'm like, no, we gotta get a D.C.
[01:54:29.129 --> 01:54:29.390]  office.
[01:54:29.410 --> 01:54:30.190]  I don't know if I'm gonna do it.
[01:54:30.811 --> 01:54:35.034]  The media took that and ran and said, oh, Jones says he's getting them, but he doesn't have them.
[01:54:35.634 --> 01:54:36.835]  You've gotta have an office.
[01:54:36.895 --> 01:54:38.297]  You've gotta have a driver's license there.
[01:54:38.637 --> 01:54:39.658]  Well, he got a weekly pass.
[01:54:39.678 --> 01:54:41.359]  Of course, he's had stuff like this before.
[01:54:41.679 --> 01:54:42.900]  He's got congressional passes.
[01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:44.641]  He's covered the campaigns.
[01:54:45.022 --> 01:54:46.683]  He's been one of the top political pundits in the country.
[01:54:46.703 --> 01:54:47.464]  Everybody knows that.
[01:54:48.344 --> 01:54:50.106]  And so he got around to getting it.
[01:54:51.463 --> 01:54:52.724]  All hell broke loose.
[01:54:53.284 --> 01:54:57.167]  Some publications tried to imply we were lying and he wasn't even there.
[01:54:58.128 --> 01:55:02.731]  The truth is most days there's not even a reason to be there because the president's gone right now anyway.
[01:55:02.811 --> 01:55:05.353]  So this is Corsi that broke three months ago.
[01:55:05.413 --> 01:55:07.154]  They're stealing the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac money.
[01:55:07.895 --> 01:55:10.177]  Mnuchin confirmed that three weeks ago and we got credit.
[01:55:11.147 --> 01:55:13.468]  Most of the meetings don't happen at briefings, they happen at dinners.
[01:55:13.928 --> 01:55:16.148]  Like he was at one with the Vice President a few nights ago.
[01:55:16.168 --> 01:55:17.369]  Oops, maybe I'm not supposed to say that.
[01:55:17.649 --> 01:55:23.951]  The point is, you've been friends with Donald Trump for 40 years, you guys were at the Tower just four or five months ago together.
[01:55:24.271 --> 01:55:28.232]  I mean, they act like we're not real media, we're begging for press passes.
[01:55:28.612 --> 01:55:31.273]  Sure, low levels trying to block us, but they failed.
[01:55:32.782 --> 01:55:36.325]  Well, it also is amazing to me the Twitters.
[01:55:36.405 --> 01:55:38.868]  I mean, I've been blocking these Twitters.
[01:55:40.129 --> 01:55:42.471]  Just vile, vile comments.
[01:55:42.531 --> 01:55:44.513]  I mean, people, irrational.
[01:55:44.573 --> 01:55:46.955]  And look at these adult women.
[01:55:47.075 --> 01:55:48.136]  Look at the pictures of them.
[01:55:48.757 --> 01:55:50.679]  It's just a string of swear words.
[01:55:50.699 --> 01:55:51.580]  Temper tantrums!
[01:55:53.281 --> 01:55:55.442]  Yeah, I think these people have lost their minds.
[01:55:55.543 --> 01:56:11.612]  I mean, the insults and the, you know, completely without any knowledge base at all, saying that, you know, we are destroying the news media because we've gotten press credentials at the White House.
[01:56:12.192 --> 01:56:18.156]  I mean, this type of thing is just a censorship again and on the left and an intolerance.
[01:56:18.857 --> 01:56:26.202]  You know, if you don't take their story and look at the views their way, then the left goes so berserk they want to almost do violence.
[01:56:48.797 --> 01:56:50.290]  They're journalists, and they're scared of you!
[01:56:51.874 --> 01:56:55.477]  Well, you know, I've been at this a long time, and I've had press credentials.
[01:56:55.557 --> 01:57:03.462]  I've traveled as Traveling Press with George Romney the last three weeks of the 2012 presidential campaign.
[01:57:03.482 --> 01:57:07.986]  I've attended any number of presidential speeches.
[01:57:08.046 --> 01:57:12.889]  I've seen in person every president back to Dwight Eisenhower.
[01:57:12.909 --> 01:57:16.072]  I even saw Harry Truman as a child.
[01:57:16.092 --> 01:57:19.114]  I mean, I've seen every one of them and known very many of them.
[01:57:20.615 --> 01:57:27.059]  I've been at this for a long time, and you know, my PhD in political science was when I was 25 years old.
[01:57:27.079 --> 01:57:37.406]  I spent 25 years in international finance, and I've worked around the world, creating, working with banks, working with finance companies at top security clearances.
[01:57:37.926 --> 01:57:39.508]  I broke any number of stories.
[01:57:39.568 --> 01:57:42.289]  I've written six New York Times best-selling books.
[01:57:42.329 --> 01:57:43.530]  Two of them were number one.
[01:57:44.411 --> 01:57:45.912]  I thought three were number one!
[01:57:47.530 --> 01:57:52.312]  When you count that, I ghost wrote one that was number one.
[01:57:52.772 --> 01:57:55.153]  Under my own name, I have two number one.
[01:57:55.173 --> 01:57:59.274]  I have the Abomination and Unfit for Command.
[01:58:00.055 --> 01:58:03.336]  But I've had six New York Times Best Sellers.
[01:58:03.356 --> 01:58:05.116]  I've written 20 books since 2004.
[01:58:05.636 --> 01:58:09.418]  And I've been published in international journals.
[01:58:09.498 --> 01:58:10.558]  I mean, it's been all over.
[01:58:11.258 --> 01:58:13.399]  And it's extensive.
[01:58:13.439 --> 01:58:15.360]  The mainstream media doesn't want to acknowledge it.
[01:58:17.233 --> 01:58:23.658]  Well, it's just so crazy how they keep trying to brand us as fake news when it isn't that we're in the White House that we're real news.
[01:58:23.718 --> 01:58:25.700]  It's that they follow us.
[01:58:25.820 --> 01:58:27.602]  I mean, we're the ones breaking the big news.
[01:58:27.662 --> 01:58:29.083]  We're the ones that have the contacts.
[01:58:29.443 --> 01:58:30.744]  We're the ones that have the guests.
[01:58:31.124 --> 01:58:35.568]  I mean, I just had the guy on from the peace rally in Manchester an hour ago.
[01:58:35.588 --> 01:58:37.910]  We're going to come back with Dr. Corsi and your phone calls.
[01:58:37.930 --> 01:58:38.571]  Thanks for holding.
[01:58:39.031 --> 01:58:40.912]  Third hour is about to begin.
[01:58:41.893 --> 01:58:43.494]  It's an act of rebellion to spread the link.
[01:58:43.554 --> 01:58:44.614]  Infowars.com.
[01:58:45.455 --> 01:58:46.915]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:58:47.056 --> 01:58:49.477]  Visit Infowarslife.com to secure your canister.
[01:58:49.657 --> 01:58:56.940]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[01:58:57.140 --> 01:59:07.465]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at Infowarslife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[01:59:07.785 --> 01:59:15.369]  In the history of InfoWars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[01:59:15.629 --> 01:59:25.595]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[01:59:25.835 --> 01:59:27.756]  And this part is most important.
[01:59:27.896 --> 01:59:34.340]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standards.
[01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:35.802]  That means it's clean.
[01:59:36.122 --> 01:59:37.143]  That means it's pure.
[01:59:37.264 --> 01:59:40.087]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[01:59:40.167 --> 01:59:42.791]  That's InfoWarsLive.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:59:42.951 --> 01:59:44.633]  Take action now before we sell out.
[01:59:46.656 --> 01:59:50.741]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:51.262 --> 01:59:52.543]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:01.627 --> 02:00:04.152]  Everybody can hear the excitement in my voice.
[02:00:04.172 --> 02:00:05.334]  The fact that I'm so earnest.
[02:00:06.497 --> 02:00:07.358]  Not like that in person.
[02:00:09.614 --> 02:00:14.095]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:00:14.476 --> 02:00:17.516]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:17.636 --> 02:00:38.243]  But I get in here and do hours of preparation at home and then here at the office and then work into the evening many days and on the weekends just looking at the globalists announcing the end of humanity and genetic engineering and bringing in the islamicist and ending free market and they're just horrible people are selling baby parts and it's just like no!
[02:00:39.906 --> 02:00:41.407]  And I'm just here ringing the alarm.
[02:00:41.427 --> 02:00:44.868]  Does it mean the alarm sometimes is, you know, has a pretty sound to it?
[02:00:44.928 --> 02:00:45.128]  No.
[02:00:45.509 --> 02:00:46.929]  But it's getting the job done.
[02:00:46.969 --> 02:00:51.431]  We are all Paul Revere's in the fight to awaken humanity and I salute you all.
[02:00:52.172 --> 02:00:55.053]  Let's go to taking calls here with Dr. Corsi.
[02:00:55.073 --> 02:00:57.354]  Let's talk to Terrence in Scotland.
[02:00:57.374 --> 02:00:58.535]  Terrence, thank you for holding.
[02:00:58.995 --> 02:01:02.657]  You want to talk about UK cuckolding or the way that they've taken
[02:01:03.257 --> 02:01:09.699]  Folks that were historically not easy to roll over, even the Romans couldn't conquer that area, but now just love to be slaves.
[02:01:09.739 --> 02:01:10.239]  What's happened?
[02:01:12.300 --> 02:01:21.002]  First off, Alex, you know, it's an absolute pleasure to be on this show and under the given circumstances, I wish it was under happier circumstances.
[02:01:21.022 --> 02:01:24.083]  Yes, I'm very sad about the dead young girls, particularly sickening.
[02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:38.448]  Yes, even though I live up here in Aberdeen, actually not too far from Donald Trump's lovely golf course, I lived in Manchester for eight years as a student and as a doctor working in the local hospitals there, so it's a home from home.
[02:01:39.169 --> 02:01:51.697]  And I tell you what, after the attack in Westminster Bridge last month, I no longer feel shocked, I no longer feel upset, I am seething with anger right now, just how inept
[02:01:52.478 --> 02:02:03.361]  Not just your leaders, and of course your Senate and Congress are acting, but our leaders here, not just in the UK, but in Europe, are dealing with this problem, the migrant crisis, right now.
[02:02:04.201 --> 02:02:14.284]  Well they even preempted the terror attack news last night, running Trump in the ground saying he asked intelligence chiefs, you know, to tell the public he wasn't a Russian, because they all have the intel he's not a Russian agent.
[02:02:14.584 --> 02:02:16.225]  That was in the news three months ago, now it's like,
[02:02:16.525 --> 02:02:17.065]  Breaking.
[02:02:17.165 --> 02:02:19.626]  He obstructed justice with other leaders.
[02:02:19.726 --> 02:02:20.247]  No he didn't.
[02:02:20.507 --> 02:02:23.268]  He publicly said, they have the intel, release it.
[02:02:23.768 --> 02:02:27.510]  He as president, I guess could, he doesn't want to damage intelligence.
[02:02:27.730 --> 02:02:28.510]  He has it all.
[02:02:28.750 --> 02:02:31.891]  He knows Hillary is a Chinese agent on the Russian payroll.
[02:02:32.372 --> 02:02:33.452]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:02:34.112 --> 02:02:35.233]  It's just frustrating.
[02:02:36.363 --> 02:02:44.533]  To see them out to get Trump, out to get nationalism, out to try to stop your government finally trying to control its borders, wanting the UK to commit suicide.
[02:02:44.573 --> 02:02:47.977]  Where do you think this is all going as a medical doctor there in Scotland?
[02:02:50.293 --> 02:02:57.200]  Well, first off, in terms of the nationalist wave sweeping, not just the States, worldwide, and it's hitting Western Europe hard.
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:11.074]  Ignore what the lamestream media is saying about nationalism dying, taking a hit to the head with Macron, with Goethe-Bilders, then, of course, what happened in Austria earlier this year.
[02:03:11.434 --> 02:03:12.515]  That is absolute bull.
[02:03:12.575 --> 02:03:13.957]  Oh, we know they're stealing the elections.
[02:03:15.700 --> 02:03:18.701]  Yeah, it's not just Stephen, the elections, they forget to actually look at the numbers.
[02:03:19.281 --> 02:03:27.204]  If we just look at, for example, the Netherlands, you know, the elections there, they said, oh, Gert Wilders, he didn't win all of his seats, but he got an improvement.
[02:03:27.324 --> 02:03:27.804]  And guess what?
[02:03:27.865 --> 02:03:30.165]  The center-left parties got annihilated.
[02:03:31.086 --> 02:03:31.526]  That's right.
[02:03:31.546 --> 02:03:34.507]  The center-left and leftist parties are becoming extinct.
[02:03:34.827 --> 02:03:37.568]  They're having to now pose as kind of nationalist-lite.
[02:03:37.828 --> 02:03:39.289]  That'll only work for one season.
[02:03:39.509 --> 02:03:40.329]  What an amazing league.
[02:03:40.389 --> 02:03:42.010]  It's so good to have great callers like you, Terrence.
[02:03:42.030 --> 02:03:42.470]  Anything else?
[02:03:44.028 --> 02:03:51.654]  Yes, first off, you know, as someone once said, these changes, unfortunately, may not happen in one cycle.
[02:03:51.674 --> 02:03:54.416]  And you hit the hammer right, you know, you hit the nail on the head, Alex.
[02:03:54.976 --> 02:03:56.097]  It's a two cycle process.
[02:03:56.117 --> 02:03:59.779]  So give Europe a chance by the next election cycles.
[02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:02.421]  Nationalism will take over.
[02:04:02.481 --> 02:04:03.862]  We will defeat these globalists.
[02:04:04.022 --> 02:04:07.405]  And I want to finish off with just a glowing endorsement of your products.
[02:04:07.992 --> 02:04:14.077]  We're not for the extremely extortionate customs taxes that the EU has put on American goods.
[02:04:14.117 --> 02:04:19.581]  For example, if I were to want to buy Californian wine, I have to pay a 19% surcharge on your stuff.
[02:04:19.821 --> 02:04:25.825]  If I want to buy what I want, which is a Ford Mustang, I have to pay 34% custom tax on it.
[02:04:25.865 --> 02:04:26.666]  That's ridiculous.
[02:04:27.561 --> 02:04:29.242]  Um, anyway, going about your products.
[02:04:29.602 --> 02:04:30.622]  Love the water filters.
[02:04:30.662 --> 02:04:34.904]  I bought two Pro-Pure water filters for my mum, dad, and of course myself.
[02:04:35.164 --> 02:04:35.744]  Excellent stuff.
[02:04:35.784 --> 02:04:39.186]  And of course, the Super Glue, no, sorry, Super Glue toothpaste.
[02:04:39.206 --> 02:04:40.046]  It's fantastic.
[02:04:40.066 --> 02:04:41.487]  Just don't mention my sister, who's a dentist.
[02:04:41.787 --> 02:04:42.967]  She's a fluoride advocate.
[02:04:43.468 --> 02:04:44.188]  I don't listen to her.
[02:04:44.308 --> 02:04:45.268]  So, there you go.
[02:04:45.548 --> 02:04:45.969]  Love your products.
[02:04:45.989 --> 02:04:47.169]  Well, God bless you for the plugs.
[02:04:47.189 --> 02:04:52.511]  Yeah, that's what Trump's mad about, is these tariffs on America are just insane, and they hurt consumers in the UK.
[02:04:52.531 --> 02:04:53.272]  God bless you, Terrence.
[02:04:53.292 --> 02:04:53.912]  Thanks for the support.
[02:04:56.175 --> 02:04:58.366]  Imagine the world without InfoWars.
[02:05:01.782 --> 02:05:03.623]  The globalists have already consolidated their power.
[02:05:04.304 --> 02:05:07.986]  They don't want people to have their own economies, their own choices.
[02:05:08.706 --> 02:05:22.034]  When you spread the links to Infowars.com news stories and our videos, when you tell friends, family, and neighbors about our free iPhone and Droid apps, or send them a link to our daily podcast, you are involved in a revolutionary act against tyranny.
[02:05:22.454 --> 02:05:27.617]  It was George Orwell that said, in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[02:05:28.377 --> 02:05:39.634]  That's why I spend a lot of time trying to not just innovate news and analysis and our fight against the globalists, but also thinking about how we're able to fund our operation.
[02:05:39.894 --> 02:05:42.438]  That's so critical to prosecute an information war.
[02:05:43.739 --> 02:05:58.565]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic and high quality.
[02:05:58.945 --> 02:06:01.086]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we have private labeled it.
[02:06:02.446 --> 02:06:14.774]  And it is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emrix Essentials, and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from InfoWareStore.com.
[02:06:15.615 --> 02:06:24.260]  On top of that, if you sign up for AutoShip, you get an additional, out of the gates, 25% off on this product.
[02:06:24.841 --> 02:06:29.964]  Emrix Essentials is all about personal care, hygiene, not getting skin cancer.
[02:06:30.484 --> 02:06:34.145]  Not getting bit by a bunch of bugs and gnats and mosquitoes.
[02:06:34.646 --> 02:06:35.626]  It's all there.
[02:06:35.786 --> 02:06:39.847]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash.
[02:06:40.308 --> 02:06:42.408]  All of it is truly game-changing.
[02:06:42.909 --> 02:06:43.709]  Be-A-Way Spray.
[02:06:44.009 --> 02:06:45.990]  Totally organic, essential oils.
[02:06:46.730 --> 02:06:50.292]  Works a lot better than the toxic chemical systems that are out there.
[02:06:50.673 --> 02:06:52.934]  And it is comparable in price.
[02:06:53.254 --> 02:06:54.695]  And again, it's concentrated.
[02:06:55.016 --> 02:06:56.437]  The deodorant is amazing.
[02:06:56.897 --> 02:06:57.577]  High quality.
[02:06:58.258 --> 02:06:59.819]  Doesn't have the aluminum garbage in it.
[02:07:00.079 --> 02:07:00.819]  Totally natural.
[02:07:01.100 --> 02:07:01.600]  Works great.
[02:07:02.521 --> 02:07:05.362]  SPF 30 face and body lotion sunscreen.
[02:07:05.763 --> 02:07:06.303]  Unscented.
[02:07:06.843 --> 02:07:07.804]  This is exciting.
[02:07:07.904 --> 02:07:11.507]  Because so many of the so-called sunscreens that are out there are toxic.
[02:07:12.067 --> 02:07:14.048]  As everyone knows, I'm obsessed with Win-Wins.
[02:07:14.068 --> 02:07:14.709]  20% off what it is retail.
[02:07:16.970 --> 02:07:18.370]  Because we cut out the middleman.
[02:07:19.171 --> 02:07:23.612]  And then, additionally, if you sign up for AutoShip, out of the gates, 25% off that.
[02:07:24.092 --> 02:07:26.112]  Because I want you to try these products.
[02:07:26.252 --> 02:07:27.492]  I want you to love these products.
[02:07:27.832 --> 02:07:38.455]  I want to have a deeper relationship with you in a 360 win, a non-zero-sum game, where you get high quality, you get value, and you repeat order something you need every month.
[02:07:39.335 --> 02:07:46.966]  And then we're able to secure our funding into the future to not just stay at the level we're at, but to grow in the face of enemy attacks.
[02:07:47.246 --> 02:07:51.873]  InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, and you'll find Emmerich's Essentials.
[02:08:05.899 --> 02:08:10.401]  Live from the InfoHorse.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:13.582 --> 02:08:18.525]  Yeah, I got no friends because they can read the papers.
[02:08:22.726 --> 02:08:24.847]  It's crazy to actually be living an Alice Cooper song.
[02:08:24.867 --> 02:08:25.288]  Crank it up.
[02:08:35.370 --> 02:08:38.992]  You know though, this isn't 30 years ago when the newspapers were all on about you, it would destroy you.
[02:08:39.152 --> 02:08:40.373]  Imagine how bad it was back then.
[02:08:41.054 --> 02:08:48.258]  Now a lot of folks know they're a bunch of liars, but I tell you, they tell such intense lies sometimes, I read it and I go, did I really do that?
[02:08:48.298 --> 02:08:49.919]  Then I go research it and I didn't do it.
[02:08:51.040 --> 02:08:56.443]  My mom called up a couple months ago, she goes, did you say Hillary was in a basement murdering and torturing kids to death?
[02:08:56.463 --> 02:08:57.484]  And I went, no mom.
[02:08:59.002 --> 02:09:08.752]  And then I went and saw what Megyn Kelly had said, and then I went and pulled up the actual show, and I said, I don't know if she's killing kids in these basements, but now there's a lot of weird stuff going on in the WikiLeaks.
[02:09:09.953 --> 02:09:21.665]  But I said, I sure know that she funded radical Islam running around, selling kids into sex slavery, murdering women, hundreds of thousands dead, Libya, Syria, overthrowing her allies in Egypt.
[02:09:22.602 --> 02:09:31.164]  So I said, she's guilty of that, the 500,000 dead kids and the Clinton administration increasing sanctions like five times, even what George Herbert Walker Bush did.
[02:09:33.544 --> 02:09:34.844]  So yeah, she's guilty of that.
[02:09:35.264 --> 02:09:38.645]  They edited it and said that I said she was doing it.
[02:09:41.646 --> 02:09:43.066]  That's how sophisticated the media is.
[02:09:43.086 --> 02:09:46.267]  They go, oh, you ran a report about something at a pizza place.
[02:09:46.587 --> 02:09:48.067]  I'm like, oh yeah, that's somebody else's report.
[02:09:49.249 --> 02:09:49.989]  I'll retract that.
[02:09:50.029 --> 02:09:53.251]  Then they go, oh, he retracted that Hillary was killing people in a basement.
[02:09:53.311 --> 02:09:57.652]  See, they use a retraction to put things onto it you didn't say or you didn't do.
[02:09:58.052 --> 02:10:03.174]  That's how, and now I'm like, oh, I can't ever retract anything again because they'll misrepresent what I retracted.
[02:10:04.215 --> 02:10:06.436]  Which regular news does retractions every day.
[02:10:06.956 --> 02:10:08.016]  We've done like three in 22 years.
[02:10:08.036 --> 02:10:08.136]  So.
[02:10:11.127 --> 02:10:12.608]  Not just no more Mr. Nice Guy.
[02:10:12.628 --> 02:10:13.828]  I guess we can't do retractions.
[02:10:13.848 --> 02:10:19.711]  We have to have like legal agreements where you can't say a retraction was for this or that, where you just make up a bunch of stuff.
[02:10:20.892 --> 02:10:23.673]  That's why I've challenged Shabani to put out the settlement.
[02:10:24.233 --> 02:10:26.174]  They had the media everywhere say I paid them a bunch of money.
[02:10:26.214 --> 02:10:26.895]  That's not true.
[02:10:27.855 --> 02:10:31.457]  Not a bunch, not a... I've signed an agreement where I can't say anything.
[02:10:32.912 --> 02:10:35.914]  I wish I could tell you which way the money was going here.
[02:10:36.595 --> 02:10:41.638]  And I'm real tempted about breaking the agreement because they, I believe, did it with newspapers putting out this info.
[02:10:41.678 --> 02:10:43.059]  In fact, my lawyers are sure of it.
[02:10:43.099 --> 02:10:43.699]  They have sources.
[02:10:45.865 --> 02:10:46.746]  Let's just say D.C.
[02:10:46.786 --> 02:10:49.468]  and places are very small, you know, very small community.
[02:10:50.249 --> 02:10:51.910]  So we got Dr. Mercola coming up in a few minutes.
[02:10:51.950 --> 02:10:54.052]  I apologize for having to move him an hour and move him late.
[02:10:54.352 --> 02:10:56.594]  With the terror attack, though, obviously big things are happening.
[02:10:56.634 --> 02:11:06.221]  But the reason I wanted to get him on, even though there was a terror attack, obviously, yesterday and most posts would cancel a piece on wellness, is this is something we can do something about.
[02:11:06.642 --> 02:11:07.302]  But I want to be clear.
[02:11:07.742 --> 02:11:09.064]  I'm not even an enemy of Islam.
[02:11:09.864 --> 02:11:18.572]  I'm really upset by the globalist social engineers trying to bring in this incompatible group to our country and then using the terror attacks to take our freedoms.
[02:11:20.353 --> 02:11:22.996]  That's really why the Western elites are bringing this in.
[02:11:24.335 --> 02:11:48.730]  And the left uses their foot soldiers, but Dr. Corsi, I'm going to go to, after you're gone here with Mercola, it'll be all over the map, but it's okay, Jason in Germany and Devin and Trevor and Cindy and a few others, and then I'm going to go to Mercola here in just a few minutes with this new book that we sell at InfoWarsTore.com that's been highly anticipated and is a game changer, but just closing comments about what we've seen, what we've witnessed, and the state of the Trump administration right now.
[02:11:50.325 --> 02:11:54.187]  Well, I think the Trump administration is going to be dramatically benefited by this press.
[02:11:54.807 --> 02:12:03.932]  Let's face it, this is the first time that the world has seen Trump on the world stage, and I think they're getting a very, very favorable image of him.
[02:12:03.952 --> 02:12:05.032]  He shined on it, didn't he?
[02:12:05.052 --> 02:12:05.993]  He looked really good.
[02:12:06.993 --> 02:12:11.335]  He looked terrific, and the speeches have been extremely well received.
[02:12:11.395 --> 02:12:19.559]  I mean, there's no president who's gone to the three major religions, gone to the site of Islam, you know,
[02:12:19.989 --> 02:12:25.230]  Saudi Arabia, which protects the two most sacred geographical sites in Islam.
[02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:31.132]  He's gone now to Israel and met with the Jewish state.
[02:12:31.272 --> 02:12:34.473]  Now he's headed, today he's in the Vatican.
[02:12:34.513 --> 02:12:36.194]  He will be meeting with the Pope tomorrow.
[02:12:36.894 --> 02:12:44.296]  Three major religions asked to come together to responsibly combat these radicals.
[02:12:44.356 --> 02:12:47.917]  Islam wants to say, well, if they're terrorists, they're not Islam.
[02:12:47.977 --> 02:12:48.237]  Fine.
[02:12:49.008 --> 02:13:15.288]  Let's make sure we redefine Islam and go through a reformation so we can come out of this with a resolve across all three religions that we're going to do things like destroy ISIS, not just denigrate or wear it down, but to destroy it, to destroy al Qaeda, to destroy these terrorist groups and make sure that Iran does not get nuclear weapons.
[02:13:15.388 --> 02:13:18.290]  And by the way, I think North Korea is going to be right on the agenda.
[02:13:18.749 --> 02:13:20.570]  As soon as Donald Trump gets back home.
[02:13:39.625 --> 02:13:45.189]  Has made a lot of comments about, they're not terrorists, they're not bad, I hate Europe's Christian roots.
[02:13:45.309 --> 02:13:49.092]  I mean, this current Pope, what is going on with him, from your intel?
[02:13:50.073 --> 02:14:00.820]  Well, the Pope is a socialist from Argentina, and he comes through the entire Argentinian Catholic Church, which was very radically to the left.
[02:14:01.641 --> 02:14:07.165]  And the Pope has been more in line with Barack Obama than he is with Donald Trump.
[02:14:08.049 --> 02:14:15.334]  The challenge for the Pope is going to be that Donald Trump has now made it clear that we are not at war with Islam.
[02:14:15.654 --> 02:14:20.138]  Islam is accepted, and that's something the Pope wants to have happen.
[02:14:20.558 --> 02:14:35.969]  The Pope is going to have to really, I think, come into a bond with the rest of the churches, with the Jewish religion, with Islamic religion, and bring the Catholic religion along.
[02:14:36.465 --> 02:14:39.167]  I mean, these are major, major changes.
[02:14:39.187 --> 02:14:49.754]  I think the, you know, the Anglican religion, the whole idea now of getting the UK much more involved in fighting terrorism.
[02:14:50.474 --> 02:14:56.518]  And we've got to be clear that what we're fighting is, you know, this whole issue of radical Islamic terrorism.
[02:14:56.983 --> 02:15:01.769]  Alright, and whether or not you're defining these as soon as they're terrorists, they're not any longer part of Islam.
[02:15:01.810 --> 02:15:04.273]  Well, that's too convenient a definition.
[02:15:04.333 --> 02:15:07.537]  I mean, basically... That causes sectarian violence between Shiite cities.
[02:15:07.557 --> 02:15:10.441]  Well, then let me ask you this and let you go, because we've got our next guest and we'll need a few calls.
[02:15:10.902 --> 02:15:11.683]  But this is all revenue.
[02:15:11.923 --> 02:15:18.545]  Politico's even come out and said, okay, Trump did do a real alliance, the Saudis are suddenly even apologizing to U.S.
[02:15:18.665 --> 02:15:24.007]  envoys, liberal envoys, and are now admitting they were behind Al-Qaeda and saying, we made a mistake.
[02:15:24.407 --> 02:15:25.428]  Is it because they failed?
[02:15:25.768 --> 02:15:27.508]  Is it because they got their butt kicked in Syria?
[02:15:27.928 --> 02:15:28.549]  What happened?
[02:15:28.569 --> 02:15:34.010]  Because suddenly the word is, the Saudis are actually saying, okay, we were behind it, we apologize.
[02:15:34.251 --> 02:15:36.191]  What got them to suddenly roll over to Trump?
[02:15:37.392 --> 02:15:41.353]  I think the Saudis realized that the threat is about to
[02:15:42.159 --> 02:15:56.905]  To the same kind of an Arab Spring that we saw with the Muslim Brotherhood, the Saudis are fearful for retaining their own kingdom and having the radicals, which they've now nurtured and funded, turn against the Saudi government.
[02:15:57.506 --> 02:15:58.406]  That's the threat.
[02:15:59.086 --> 02:16:11.792]  And if Wahhabism combines effectively with Al Qaeda and ISIS within the Sunnis, then the Saudi Arabian government is at threat of being overthrown.
[02:16:12.520 --> 02:16:12.580]  Yes.
[02:16:24.963 --> 02:16:29.404]  Terrorism any longer, and if it's part of Islam, we're going to define it as outside Islam.
[02:16:29.424 --> 02:16:30.184]  But let's be clear.
[02:16:30.344 --> 02:16:33.125]  The West, behind the scenes, wanted to work with radical Islam.
[02:16:33.385 --> 02:16:37.846]  The real leverage the Saudis now know is, we're not going to work with radical Islam behind the scenes.
[02:16:38.166 --> 02:16:39.346]  This is a real war on it.
[02:16:39.626 --> 02:16:44.127]  You better pick a side right now, or we're going to destabilize you and blow you off the map.
[02:16:44.407 --> 02:16:47.728]  You can either be modern, have the weapons, have the technology, be respected.
[02:16:48.168 --> 02:16:50.089]  You keep playing a double game, it's over.
[02:16:50.349 --> 02:16:52.009]  That's what I've been told by my army sources.
[02:16:53.049 --> 02:16:56.651]  Yeah, and it's also aimed very strong at Iran.
[02:16:57.091 --> 02:17:04.955]  Because Iran is, I think, you know, also one of the major, major factors here of destabilizing the country.
[02:17:05.015 --> 02:17:08.717]  And that's what got Saudi Arabia to finally get in line, is they're really fearful of Iran.
[02:17:09.638 --> 02:17:15.921]  Yeah, and in fact, Iran, I think, is going to have to take the agreement that President Obama signed and rip it up.
[02:17:16.681 --> 02:17:18.302]  Because it's not going to be followed.
[02:17:18.382 --> 02:17:19.963]  The President Trump understands.
[02:17:20.436 --> 02:17:23.758]  We can't give the Iranians 10 years to build nuclear weapons.
[02:17:24.218 --> 02:17:25.479]  They've got to be stopped now.
[02:17:26.039 --> 02:17:32.142]  The two countries that are going to go on the block, as soon as he comes back, I think are North Korea and Iran.
[02:17:32.802 --> 02:17:38.365]  And neither one of them are going to be allowed to continue advancing as rapidly as they are to nuclear weapons.
[02:17:38.445 --> 02:17:39.866]  Great points.
[02:17:40.006 --> 02:17:41.746]  Major geopolitical alignments happening.
[02:17:41.766 --> 02:17:42.447]  Thank you, Dr. Corsi.
[02:17:43.427 --> 02:17:43.787]  Thank you.
[02:18:02.361 --> 02:18:08.609]  New York Times bestselling author of Effortless Healing, a revolutionary diet to combat cancer, boost brain power, increase your energy.
[02:18:08.989 --> 02:18:10.772]  Now what's crazy is he pioneered a lot of this.
[02:18:11.132 --> 02:18:12.474]  Suddenly big studies are out.
[02:18:12.614 --> 02:18:19.562]  Silicon Valley was in the news a few months ago saying they're obsessed with the pure fat, the uncooked fat.
[02:18:20.083 --> 02:18:20.423]  I don't know.
[02:18:45.031 --> 02:18:45.772]  Yes, thank you.
[02:18:46.033 --> 02:18:49.959]  It does feel tremendous to offer a resource that's so helpful to so many.
[02:18:50.039 --> 02:18:54.245]  So it really addresses some major challenges we have in this country.
[02:18:54.266 --> 02:18:57.791]  50% of the people watching this are going to come down with cancer, 50% of the men, 40% of the women.
[02:18:59.648 --> 02:19:02.610]  And that's not skin cancer, that's serious cancer.
[02:19:02.670 --> 02:19:04.091]  It's going to be the leading cause of death.
[02:19:04.131 --> 02:19:16.838]  And this is, we discussed the strategies on how to get your body to burn fat as a primary fuel, which is one of the most potent interventions you can have as a foundation to prevent not only cancer, but heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.
[02:19:21.741 --> 02:19:23.743]  You know, I'm just sitting here reading the back of the book.
[02:19:23.763 --> 02:19:25.704]  I'm going to go ahead and skip this break so we have more time.
[02:19:27.146 --> 02:19:43.388]  And going through what you break down in here, I remember my dad, who's a physician as well, when I was a little kid going, this is bull about low-fat diets, it's the kind of fat, if you want, you know, clean fat, fat that hadn't been burned, that hadn't made the fats, you know, basically become
[02:19:44.289 --> 02:19:45.871]  You know, toxic molecules.
[02:19:46.331 --> 02:19:47.852]  That was the word he was using when I was a little kid.
[02:19:48.193 --> 02:19:49.694]  Now we have all these technical terms.
[02:19:50.375 --> 02:19:52.857]  And so this has been known for a while.
[02:19:52.877 --> 02:19:54.899]  It just hasn't been popularized.
[02:19:54.939 --> 02:19:56.821]  I know you were talking about it 30 years ago.
[02:19:56.881 --> 02:20:00.284]  So how did my dad, 30-something years ago, 40 years ago, know about this?
[02:20:00.624 --> 02:20:01.585]  How did you know about it?
[02:20:01.805 --> 02:20:03.167]  You've now collated it into a book.
[02:20:03.387 --> 02:20:06.390]  But again, why are they now suddenly admitting you're right?
[02:20:07.699 --> 02:20:18.782]  Well, your dad had that rare commodity called common sense, and I apparently didn't have it because at the same time your dad understood and I was clueless and had bought into the low-fat myth because it was supported by all these things.
[02:20:18.822 --> 02:20:25.284]  Okay, so maybe you just were doing the low-fat thing a long time ago, but I remember you for a while saying... No, no, I mean, we're talking the 70s and 80s.
[02:20:25.304 --> 02:20:25.404]  Yeah.
[02:20:27.469 --> 02:20:31.231]  Woke up in the 90s, but your dad, I think, understood it long before then.
[02:20:31.951 --> 02:20:40.155]  And even though the title of the book is Fat for Fuel, your dad also recognized it's the low quality fat that is probably even a more pernicious toxin.
[02:20:40.255 --> 02:20:44.877]  So the industrialized processed vegetable oils, you know, those will get you sicker than sugar.
[02:20:45.437 --> 02:20:47.518]  So it's, it's, we're talking about high quality.
[02:20:47.538 --> 02:20:48.799]  Well, that's because he's also a chemist.
[02:20:48.839 --> 02:20:51.460]  He was explaining that when you burn this stuff, heat it up, change it.
[02:20:52.861 --> 02:21:00.745]  Yes, it's not only trans fats, it's these cyclic aldehydes, which are now even potentially more toxic than trans fats.
[02:21:01.125 --> 02:21:10.609]  Now that trans fats are banned, these are the... So when I read the headline even on CNN that McDonald's uses plasticizers used in breast implants and nuggets, how are they able to get away with that?
[02:21:10.629 --> 02:21:15.671]  I know there's now lawsuits about food additives having a grandfather clause.
[02:21:17.361 --> 02:21:26.550]  Yeah, there's a categorization called GRASS, generally recognized as safe, and if substances have been around before a specific date, they're grandfathered in.
[02:21:27.270 --> 02:21:33.016]  Unless there's very compelling scientific evidence to counter that, and in some cases that's been the case.
[02:21:33.637 --> 02:21:40.063]  Certainly that was with trans fat, which is just, I think, banned or is in the process of being eliminated from the food scene.
[02:21:40.083 --> 02:21:41.224]  And you agree it should be, right?
[02:21:41.784 --> 02:21:42.405]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:21:42.425 --> 02:21:43.766]  There's no question, yeah.
[02:21:43.806 --> 02:21:46.248]  We've known that for probably close to 80 years.
[02:21:46.508 --> 02:21:50.612]  Dr. Fred Kumara, who's still alive at the University of Illinois, is 102 years old.
[02:21:50.652 --> 02:21:53.194]  He was one of the original scientists that figured that out in the 30s.
[02:21:53.975 --> 02:21:54.856]  Well, I've been interrupting here.
[02:21:54.896 --> 02:21:57.118]  Let's talk about, because I'm so excited, fat for fuel.
[02:21:57.438 --> 02:21:59.980]  I'm no beach boy, but I got really unhealthy over 15 years.
[02:22:00.300 --> 02:22:01.301]  I've kind of lost 60, 70 pounds.
[02:22:01.321 --> 02:22:02.943]  I've gotten a lot healthier since then.
[02:22:02.963 --> 02:22:08.808]  But by eating more uncooked fish, very low cooked beef, things like that,
[02:22:09.148 --> 02:22:10.369]  Having more micronutrients.
[02:22:10.690 --> 02:22:19.059]  So everything you've been writing about for decades, I now go into a California pizza kitchen with my children saying, we have, you know, the micronutrients, the superfoods.
[02:22:19.319 --> 02:22:27.428]  Whether that's true or not, you know that when even the fast food places, or quasi-fast food, are trying to sound like Dr. Mercola, we're turning some corner.
[02:22:28.206 --> 02:22:30.227]  Yes, we are making progress, there's no question.
[02:22:30.287 --> 02:22:37.309]  I realized a long time ago, like you, that the solution is really to go directly to the people.
[02:22:37.549 --> 02:22:44.892]  If you're trying to do it through the scientific journals and the professional community, you're going to be sabotaged because there's too many entrenched interests.
[02:22:45.172 --> 02:22:51.254]  We have a similar strategy, I reach millions like you do, and eventually the people get it.
[02:22:51.814 --> 02:22:56.816]  They start to become un-brainwashed and manipulated as they are from the traditional media.
[02:22:58.865 --> 02:23:02.671]  Well, let's walk through Fat for Fuel, available at Infowarestore.com.
[02:23:03.833 --> 02:23:06.037]  Again, this is such a beautiful book, so well written.
[02:23:07.005 --> 02:23:07.465]  I don't know.
[02:23:30.553 --> 02:23:37.215]  It has been the standard of care for the treatment of drug-resistant seizure disorders for the last 80 years, so this is nothing new.
[02:23:37.235 --> 02:23:39.195]  It's been around for a long time.
[02:23:39.215 --> 02:23:52.138]  We just started to recently appreciate its value in the treatment of all other diseases because it really addresses the foundational issue of most diseases, which is dysfunction of the mitochondria, which are these
[02:23:52.739 --> 02:23:56.068]  So why is fat so important and what types of fats are good?
[02:24:01.773 --> 02:24:04.356]  Simply because your fat burns more efficiently.
[02:24:04.416 --> 02:24:16.226]  It's less polluted fuel, so that when you burn it as a primary fuel, you generate something less reactive oxygen species, which generates secondary less free radicals, which is what causes most of the degeneration.
[02:24:16.246 --> 02:24:19.489]  So on one end, sugar is really toxic and really bad.
[02:24:19.770 --> 02:24:22.132]  On the other end, clean, uncooked fat is the best.
[02:24:23.410 --> 02:24:28.215]  Well, it's not that quite simple.
[02:24:28.335 --> 02:24:34.281]  It's actually having them in the right ratios until your body is able to have the metabolic flexibility to burn either.
[02:24:34.662 --> 02:24:43.391]  And then one of the things we introduce is to make sure that you have adequate, not excessive, protein because not only do you have to pay attention to the quality of the fat, but you have to limit the carbs.
[02:24:44.251 --> 02:24:47.853]  And the protein until your body's burning fat and then you can go on.
[02:24:47.913 --> 02:24:56.256]  So the way I should explain it, obviously I'm reading the book, is there's got to be a balance between what they call a classic Atkins diet or paleo or whatever.
[02:24:56.516 --> 02:25:00.178]  You've gone to the science to find the best type of real diet.
[02:25:00.698 --> 02:25:05.581]  Yes, because if you don't cycle this, if you just go on straight nutritional ketosis, that could be even more damaging.
[02:25:05.601 --> 02:25:09.163]  You'll basically starve to death almost and your body will start to deteriorate.
[02:25:09.563 --> 02:25:18.628]  So once you've transitioned, and we discuss how to do that in the book by measuring ketones, which are these water-soluble fats that penetrate real easily to the brain and nourish your
[02:25:19.228 --> 02:25:20.189]  Thank you so much!
[02:25:46.664 --> 02:25:51.930]  Well that makes sense because I myself, I mean I got really big, I'm like over 280 pounds now and I'm like 230 something.
[02:25:52.330 --> 02:25:53.131]  I'm still a big guy.
[02:25:53.772 --> 02:25:58.377]  But a diet works for a while and then it stops working and that's what your book gets into.
[02:25:58.397 --> 02:26:04.504]  You've got to take a spectrum of natural diets and then cycle through them because that's the only thing that's constant is change.
[02:26:05.425 --> 02:26:10.527]  Yeah, this is not a standard set of rules that we recommend for everyone.
[02:26:10.567 --> 02:26:15.148]  It's just really guidelines and within those guidelines, you customize it according to your strategy.
[02:26:15.828 --> 02:26:23.831]  So for the 70% of the people in the country who are overweight, they may want to integrate other metabolic strategies such as fasting and intermittent fasting.
[02:26:24.191 --> 02:26:35.379]  And even going on to fast for three, five, seven days, maybe even longer, can jumpstart the process at which your body starts to burn fat as its primary fuel and can be a very powerful and really inexpensive intervention.
[02:26:35.439 --> 02:26:36.599]  Doesn't cost anything to not do.
[02:26:36.619 --> 02:26:37.860]  Well, here's my problem with fasting.
[02:26:37.900 --> 02:26:39.241]  I've done it three, four days at a time.
[02:26:39.922 --> 02:26:42.103]  I've never been into drugs or anything.
[02:26:42.643 --> 02:26:46.266]  I get hired in a kite and start bouncing off the walls about day three or four.
[02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:47.140]  Yeah.
[02:26:47.380 --> 02:26:51.602]  Well, usually most people have trouble about day two or three, but it gets easier after that.
[02:26:51.722 --> 02:26:53.643]  But then you can go back on having food.
[02:26:53.743 --> 02:26:56.945]  So fasting is voluntary.
[02:26:57.005 --> 02:26:58.345]  Starvation is not.
[02:26:58.425 --> 02:27:02.387]  So you have the total flexibility to eat food whenever you feel like you need to.
[02:27:02.407 --> 02:27:04.408]  But as you said, studying history, I know you're right.
[02:27:04.548 --> 02:27:05.689]  You've written about this.
[02:27:06.609 --> 02:27:08.990]  For humans, humans are normally feast or famine, right?
[02:27:09.010 --> 02:27:11.852]  We're not supposed to just always have a ton of food or always have none.
[02:27:12.963 --> 02:27:20.447]  We only recently have had access to food 24-7 for the vast majority of human existence.
[02:27:20.487 --> 02:27:25.389]  We've had really significant amounts of times where we didn't have access to food.
[02:27:25.449 --> 02:27:32.632]  So our genetics, our biochemistry, our metabolism is designed for that, to really have that
[02:27:33.092 --> 02:27:35.615]  Well, Doc, the book is Fat for Fuel, and I've read, I don't know,
[02:27:56.115 --> 02:28:00.820]  Hundreds of news articles about the best type of diets and seven or eight books about it.
[02:28:01.320 --> 02:28:05.024]  And I gotta tell you, the reason I love the book is it isn't one diet, it isn't one formula.
[02:28:05.324 --> 02:28:13.032]  It's a spectrum of the science and what works for people to decide with their own metabolic system, their own family history, what works best for them.
[02:28:13.052 --> 02:28:14.553]  And that's why I think it's THE book.
[02:28:14.854 --> 02:28:17.877]  I think you've written, out of thousands of books, THE book out there.
[02:28:18.817 --> 02:28:20.719]  Well, it's not just that I wrote it.
[02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:24.964]  Most books are written by one author and it's their impressions and ideas.
[02:28:24.984 --> 02:28:26.366]  That's right, it's a big research document.
[02:28:27.126 --> 02:28:33.494]  But what I did was I sent it out to two dozen of the top experts in the world in this area, so it's really peer-reviewed.
[02:28:33.514 --> 02:28:34.475]  It's a consensus.
[02:28:34.995 --> 02:28:36.696]  It's not just my ideas.
[02:28:36.896 --> 02:28:41.279]  The science is really valid and accurate, and it's rock solid.
[02:28:42.760 --> 02:28:50.224]  They're going to get major benefits by doing this, and there's a consensus among the scientific researchers in recommending this type of approach.
[02:28:51.365 --> 02:28:51.705]  All right.
[02:28:51.745 --> 02:28:52.425]  We're going to go to break.
[02:28:52.445 --> 02:28:53.946]  We've got like 10 more minutes left with you.
[02:28:53.966 --> 02:28:55.407]  When we come back, I'm going to go to phone calls.
[02:28:55.527 --> 02:28:58.909]  But again, Dr. Mercola, I don't need to introduce you to folks.
[02:28:58.969 --> 02:29:00.130]  Most people know who you are.
[02:29:00.150 --> 02:29:03.252]  When we come back, I want to talk more about the book, but also briefly
[02:29:04.454 --> 02:29:15.040]  The state of the fight to have supplements, vitamins, minerals, nutrients, because I see so much demonization, more than ever, against even mainline supplements.
[02:29:15.120 --> 02:29:18.702]  I've even had news articles demonizing us now for selling organic shampoo.
[02:29:18.722 --> 02:29:20.963]  They're even demonizing selling shampoo now.
[02:29:21.003 --> 02:29:24.245]  So this seems to be like a new level of kind of the empire strikes back.
[02:29:24.905 --> 02:29:27.507]  Seem like for a while people like you were leading the fight to win.
[02:29:28.527 --> 02:29:31.269]  You know, to get GMO labeling and to wake up.
[02:29:31.750 --> 02:29:35.352]  And I think because you're winning so big, they're now counter-striking.
[02:29:35.372 --> 02:29:36.633]  I want to see if you think I'm right.
[02:29:37.054 --> 02:29:37.694]  Straight ahead.
[02:29:38.075 --> 02:29:39.636]  I'm Alex Jones with Dr. Mercola.
[02:29:39.656 --> 02:29:40.096]  Stay with us.
[02:29:44.480 --> 02:29:45.380]  We're on the march.
[02:29:45.881 --> 02:29:47.482]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:48.403 --> 02:29:51.105]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:55.359 --> 02:30:03.103]  InfoWars is partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:31:56.201 --> 02:32:02.149]  Prepping for disaster and societal unrest has now gone so mainstream that even Realtor.com is writing about it.
[02:32:02.289 --> 02:32:11.402]  But the Realtors are still embarrassed to cover the subject and eager to set themselves apart from what they call Uncle Travis' guns and canned foods militia vision of preparedness.
[02:32:11.562 --> 02:32:13.885]  Well, the ants may have the last laugh
[02:32:14.085 --> 02:32:15.085]  ...on the grasshoppers.
[02:32:15.285 --> 02:32:18.326]  But the grasshoppers will still sing the tune, if they can make money.
[02:32:18.507 --> 02:32:25.049]  But maybe you don't have a Hollywood mansion where you can drop another million dollars to turn your home theater into a radiation-proof bunker.
[02:32:25.189 --> 02:32:29.430]  There are still very effective, low-tech, low-cost things you can do to prepare.
[02:32:29.670 --> 02:32:37.133]  In fact, even realizing that there's a need to prepare and doing anything to act on that realization increases your chances of survival.
[02:32:37.473 --> 02:32:43.535]  Things that you do to prepare for an Armageddon scenario will help you to weather storms, to absorb an economic shock,
[02:32:43.815 --> 02:32:46.456]  Alright, I gave the number out earlier and then Tom got away from us.
[02:33:12.592 --> 02:33:13.673]  And I didn't get to your calls.
[02:33:14.774 --> 02:33:18.758]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:19.158 --> 02:33:20.439]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:20.960 --> 02:33:25.824]  So as soon as Dr. Mercola, who's got riveting information, leaves us here in about 10 minutes, I'm going to go right to your calls.
[02:33:26.325 --> 02:33:28.987]  And I've got some other breaking news that's exclusive to InfoWars.com.
[02:33:29.007 --> 02:33:29.307]  Kim.com.
[02:33:33.595 --> 02:33:35.716]  Was able to predict what WikiLeaks was going to put out.
[02:33:36.076 --> 02:33:37.057]  Roger Stone was not.
[02:33:37.117 --> 02:33:38.357]  I'm not putting Roger Stone down.
[02:33:38.437 --> 02:33:39.598]  I know what Roger Stone said.
[02:33:39.618 --> 02:33:41.979]  I know what Roger Stone was saying behind the scenes.
[02:33:42.700 --> 02:33:46.361]  Roger Stone was not involved with WikiLeaks because I was having the private discussions.
[02:33:46.381 --> 02:33:50.543]  He's like, yeah, I know a couple of reporters that are going to interview him that I talked to.
[02:33:50.623 --> 02:33:52.224]  Roger talks to more reporters than anybody I know.
[02:33:53.285 --> 02:33:55.766]  And he said, I'm going to try to find out what it is they claim they've got.
[02:33:56.206 --> 02:33:58.467]  Assange kept saying, I've got the big bombshell.
[02:33:58.507 --> 02:34:01.409]  I've got the big bombshell for six months, you know, before it came out.
[02:34:03.069 --> 02:34:04.310]  Right before the RNC.
[02:34:05.531 --> 02:34:13.880]  And so, Roger had the reporters go there, and they called him back and said, yeah, you know, it's about this and that.
[02:34:14.180 --> 02:34:15.261]  But that's the connection.
[02:34:15.301 --> 02:34:16.242]  It's not Russians.
[02:34:17.523 --> 02:34:18.944]  Everybody's trying to talk to Assange.
[02:34:19.025 --> 02:34:21.267]  I mean, he goes on Fox News, he goes on CNN.
[02:34:21.347 --> 02:34:27.473]  It's just like, oh, but Roger talked to some reporters that talked to him and sent a message in, so he's a Russian agent.
[02:34:28.413 --> 02:34:36.478]  But Kim Dotcom, who I'm a big fan of, and who was going to come on the show, then had some family emergency once, and he thought I was dissing him not being there, so he cancelled.
[02:34:36.538 --> 02:34:39.379]  I want to get Kim Dotcom on, because I followed Kim's tweets.
[02:34:40.060 --> 02:34:43.342]  And Kim did predict everything that happened.
[02:34:43.922 --> 02:34:45.243]  And he does have the connections.
[02:34:45.323 --> 02:34:48.105]  I know folks high up that say, oh, that's the guy to talk to.
[02:34:48.665 --> 02:34:51.146]  Quote, I know Seth Rich was involved in DNC leaks.
[02:34:51.567 --> 02:34:55.409]  Internet Guru says Rich wanted to drain the swamp from the inside.
[02:34:56.289 --> 02:34:56.830]  Both parties.
[02:34:57.796 --> 02:34:58.337]  And they killed him.
[02:35:00.380 --> 02:35:01.321]  So, this is crazy.
[02:35:01.341 --> 02:35:06.809]  Going back to Dr. Mercola, he's got the new book, Fat for Fuel, available at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:35:06.829 --> 02:35:09.273]  That way you support him, you support us, you support yourself.
[02:35:09.313 --> 02:35:11.115]  Now, I want to warn you, it's easy to read.
[02:35:12.372 --> 02:35:13.373]  But it is like a textbook.
[02:35:13.433 --> 02:35:18.796]  I mean, I don't want to say textbook for dummies, but it covers every subject, every angle.
[02:35:19.356 --> 02:35:37.008]  This is something doctors should read because this really, I think, is the key of Solomon when it comes to decoding the different paradoxes that are out there of protein, fat, different imbalances, the ramp up, the way to ease in, managing your emotions during transition.
[02:35:38.353 --> 02:35:47.981]  Because here's the deal, I can quit eating carbohydrates and stuff, and then I turn into a, not even a mean maniac, I'm like worse than I am now, bouncing off the walls.
[02:35:48.741 --> 02:35:51.704]  So no wonder they want us all eating a bunch of crap, because we're more manageable that way.
[02:35:52.664 --> 02:35:54.606]  The power of being a real human is pretty amazing.
[02:35:55.106 --> 02:35:56.768]  So it's all there, the power of fasting.
[02:35:57.048 --> 02:36:02.912]  Dr. Mercola, I want to talk about your book in closing, but first, again, thank you for coming on the broadcast, Stan, for your great work.
[02:36:03.253 --> 02:36:05.975]  What about the big picture I was mentioning before the break?
[02:36:07.754 --> 02:36:11.475]  Well, we are making progress, so we need to recognize that.
[02:36:11.495 --> 02:36:26.238]  I think the most recent observation is that California, as you probably covered in your broadcast earlier, has actually put the poison label on Roundup, and it's required that in the state of California.
[02:36:26.318 --> 02:36:28.179]  Not to give credit, but you've been pushing them for that for 20 years.
[02:36:29.329 --> 02:36:31.452]  Well, I don't know, about 20 years, but certainly for a long time.
[02:36:31.812 --> 02:36:33.054]  Most of this century, for sure.
[02:36:33.514 --> 02:36:39.121]  But, I mean, you were like the first online with this stuff in, like, I remember you were 94, 95, right?
[02:36:39.301 --> 02:36:41.484]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:36:41.524 --> 02:36:43.787]  So, we've been at it for a while.
[02:36:43.927 --> 02:36:44.288]  Actually,
[02:36:45.296 --> 02:36:53.320]  You know, my epiphany with the pernicious nature of glyphosate and Roundup really didn't occur until the early 2000s.
[02:36:54.160 --> 02:37:02.364]  But there are other major advocates out there, like Steven Druker, who is an attorney who filed a lawsuit against the FDA to... Sure, it's not about credit.
[02:37:02.404 --> 02:37:04.245]  The point is, we've all been at the tip of the spear.
[02:37:04.605 --> 02:37:05.585]  We're being vindicated.
[02:37:05.625 --> 02:37:06.406]  We're being proven right.
[02:37:07.086 --> 02:37:07.226]  Right.
[02:37:08.862 --> 02:37:09.542]  It's good to know.
[02:37:09.722 --> 02:37:14.164]  As long as people have the knowledge and information, this is a free country.
[02:37:14.204 --> 02:37:15.104]  We have freedom of choice.
[02:37:15.124 --> 02:37:16.304]  We vote with our pocketbooks.
[02:37:16.724 --> 02:37:18.125]  And that has enormous potential.
[02:37:18.145 --> 02:37:18.485]  Sure, sure.
[02:37:18.505 --> 02:37:20.405]  And when I'm giving you credit, I know you're not a big ego guy.
[02:37:20.425 --> 02:37:22.626]  It's not about, oh, you're this wonder man.
[02:37:23.106 --> 02:37:27.747]  You help with your organization and your listeners, your supporters, spearhead labeling all over the country.
[02:37:27.787 --> 02:37:30.488]  I mean, let's give you and your listeners and everybody the credit.
[02:37:31.989 --> 02:37:33.349]  The point is, we're getting things done.
[02:37:33.973 --> 02:37:34.453]  Yes, we are.
[02:37:35.234 --> 02:37:36.635]  And there's a reason for it.
[02:37:36.675 --> 02:37:58.674]  You know, I recognized I could preach to the world all I want, just like you're doing, but unless we organize and coalesce into some type of effective political health activism that we couldn't, these barriers that were in place by most of these corrupted federal regulatory agencies would impair the average person from being able to implement what we're seeking to teach them.
[02:37:58.754 --> 02:38:01.617]  So we're trying to break down those barriers and make it easy for everyone.
[02:38:02.944 --> 02:38:03.164]  Wow.
[02:38:03.685 --> 02:38:06.026]  So do you think, overall, we're starting to win?
[02:38:06.086 --> 02:38:07.608]  Or, I mean, how is the Empire striking back?
[02:38:07.628 --> 02:38:13.052]  Because it seems to be... Well, there's a lot of fronts out there, and I think we're making major progress on many of them.
[02:38:13.072 --> 02:38:14.192]  There's no doubt in my mind.
[02:38:14.273 --> 02:38:18.616]  And some of them we're losing ground, but at least we're not losing it as fast as we would if we weren't in the battle.
[02:38:19.316 --> 02:38:23.340]  So, it's a lot of work to do out there.
[02:38:23.400 --> 02:38:37.753]  We're just happy to give people the tools like Fat for Fuel that can essentially give them the freedom and insulate them from all this pernicious information they're getting so they don't have to suffer needlessly and die prematurely unnecessarily.
[02:38:40.450 --> 02:38:43.251]  It just breaks my heart to see kids dying from cancer.
[02:38:43.331 --> 02:38:44.791]  There's just no damn need for it.
[02:38:44.831 --> 02:38:48.352]  We have 1,600 people die every day in the United States.
[02:38:48.372 --> 02:38:50.713]  In fact, let me ask a few quick questions here.
[02:38:50.773 --> 02:38:52.993]  You are a medical doctor and a pioneer exposing this.
[02:38:53.533 --> 02:38:56.874]  I mean, depending on the cancer, pediatric cancer is up like 10,000% from the 1940s.
[02:38:56.914 --> 02:38:59.515]  All these other cancers are exploding.
[02:39:01.675 --> 02:39:05.716]  And they never talk about why are they increasing, but you know a lot of those answers.
[02:39:07.017 --> 02:39:08.397]  Well, there's no one simple
[02:39:09.555 --> 02:39:12.296]  Answer to that one is many variables that contribute to it.
[02:39:12.816 --> 02:39:18.077]  One is not burning fat for fuel, there's no question, but it's also the exposure of these many pernicious toxins.
[02:39:18.177 --> 02:39:26.719]  And one of the most widely and pervasive one is microwave radiation from your cell phone towers, your cell phones and your Wi-Fi routers.
[02:39:26.739 --> 02:39:27.639]  So that's a big one.
[02:39:27.819 --> 02:39:33.500]  And, you know, in conjunction with toxic food and other toxins they're exposed to in our environment.
[02:39:34.540 --> 02:39:41.224]  It can really, in infections, it can really wreak havoc on your metabolism and your health.
[02:39:43.525 --> 02:39:46.306]  Now, a few other final questions.
[02:39:46.886 --> 02:39:49.328]  I remember the headline on Mercola.com.
[02:39:49.968 --> 02:39:53.530]  It's got to be, I don't know, 15 years ago or something.
[02:39:56.091 --> 02:39:57.091]  And the headline was,
[02:40:02.588 --> 02:40:04.349]  I'm trying to get the exact headline in my mind.
[02:40:04.370 --> 02:40:10.555]  I think it was something like, uh, soft drinks, uh, non-sugar soft drinks make you fat.
[02:40:10.775 --> 02:40:16.520]  Well, now that's mainstream news all over the place that it's not just making you fat, it's eating your brain.
[02:40:17.060 --> 02:40:18.601]  Let me just point something out, Alex.
[02:40:18.661 --> 02:40:20.203]  The challenge you just had there,
[02:40:20.904 --> 02:40:21.364]  Yes, absolutely!
[02:40:38.307 --> 02:40:44.712]  And when you exhaust it in about 12 hours and you can't burn fat, you're going to be below on fuel.
[02:40:44.752 --> 02:40:51.076]  So you'll have all these symptoms with these cravings because your body needs fuel and it can't access the fat because you haven't taught it how to do it yet.
[02:40:51.136 --> 02:40:54.678]  So that's what that's what this whole book is designed to have you access it.
[02:40:54.718 --> 02:40:57.360]  And the beautiful thing was once you are burning fat as your primary fuel,
[02:40:57.640 --> 02:41:01.321]  You have this incredible mental clarity that just is unbelievable.
[02:41:01.341 --> 02:41:03.522]  Your memory, you just don't forget things anymore.
[02:41:03.542 --> 02:41:08.464]  Absolutely, because your body, by doing occasional fasting... And the cravings disappear.
[02:41:08.484 --> 02:41:10.765]  These cravings for junk food, they're just gone.
[02:41:10.825 --> 02:41:12.125]  They are just non-existent.
[02:41:12.145 --> 02:41:14.806]  You don't have to have iron willpower or discipline to implement the program.
[02:41:17.699 --> 02:41:19.020]  Well, I was interrupting there.
[02:41:19.360 --> 02:41:23.202]  And to be specific, I do get absent-minded or I do forget things.
[02:41:23.562 --> 02:41:25.863]  They had a feed in there running audio into my head.
[02:41:25.903 --> 02:41:28.584]  That's why I was unable to think of it because I was hearing somebody else talk.
[02:41:28.624 --> 02:41:29.385]  It was driving me crazy.
[02:41:29.585 --> 02:41:31.506]  But sometimes I do forget things and have brain farts.
[02:41:31.746 --> 02:41:32.986]  But, I mean, get back to this.
[02:41:33.727 --> 02:41:35.187]  Repeat what you were saying because I interrupted.
[02:41:36.648 --> 02:41:45.345]  Once you learn how to access fat by fasting or these certain diets you have in the book, fat for fuel, why all the studies, the research show it creates this incredible clarity.
[02:41:45.405 --> 02:41:46.086]  Why does it do that?
[02:41:46.567 --> 02:41:47.168]  Please repeat that.
[02:41:48.191 --> 02:41:58.364]  Well, it does it because you teach your body, you encourage it so that it really adapts to have this metabolic flexibility to burn either fat or carbohydrates.
[02:41:58.384 --> 02:42:02.388]  95% of people in the country can only burn carbohydrates as a fuel and they can't access it.
[02:42:02.428 --> 02:42:06.754]  But when you do, these ketones burn very efficiently, they create less free radicals.
[02:42:07.154 --> 02:42:07.414]  Thank you.
[02:42:24.469 --> 02:42:28.932]  Historically and through ancient times, we've gone through these periods of stress.
[02:42:28.952 --> 02:42:33.695]  So our ancestors all had this metabolic flexibility that they could nourish their brain with these ketones.
[02:42:34.116 --> 02:42:38.839]  And these ketones are not the same that you get in diabetic ketoacidosis that many people are concerned about.
[02:42:39.199 --> 02:42:42.381]  It's two different animals.
[02:42:42.401 --> 02:42:44.863]  I think Atkins helped dispel that myth.
[02:42:45.703 --> 02:42:45.804]  Sure.
[02:42:45.844 --> 02:42:47.367]  It's a completely different approach to McKinsey's.
[02:42:47.407 --> 02:42:48.348]  It's high quality food.
[02:42:48.409 --> 02:42:54.881]  I was about to say, a few times I've done diets like this, I can't handle how awake I am and how great my brain works.
[02:42:54.961 --> 02:42:56.163]  It's almost like too much.
[02:42:57.192 --> 02:42:57.933]  It really is great.
[02:42:57.953 --> 02:43:01.074]  You almost don't need the artificial stimulants or the nootropics.
[02:43:02.074 --> 02:43:09.378]  It's just an amazing transition and shift that occurs when your body is functioning the way it was designed to.
[02:43:10.338 --> 02:43:11.999]  It's nothing short of miraculous, it really is.
[02:43:12.199 --> 02:43:12.419]  Wow.
[02:43:12.499 --> 02:43:15.040]  Once you optimize your fuel strategy.
[02:43:15.180 --> 02:43:21.483]  Alright, Dr. Mercola, thank you so much for the book, Fat for Fuel, and I really appreciate the deep research you've done into it.
[02:43:21.523 --> 02:43:21.984]  God bless you.
[02:43:22.604 --> 02:43:22.824]  Alright.
[02:43:23.894 --> 02:43:24.715]  All right, there he goes.
[02:43:24.895 --> 02:43:26.917]  The book is available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:43:26.997 --> 02:43:33.003]  And listen, I don't have a lot of people on about books anymore, and I don't even go and get a lot of books and sell them.
[02:43:33.063 --> 02:43:37.467]  Used to, we'd be selling, you know, maybe 70, 80, 100 books a year or more.
[02:43:38.047 --> 02:43:46.935]  We might sell 10 books a year now because I still read a lot, but I already know most of it, and I figure you do too.
[02:43:47.736 --> 02:43:48.397]  This book,
[02:43:49.775 --> 02:43:50.295]  We're good to go.
[02:44:12.853 --> 02:44:15.556]  I've done it before and it does a lot of just amazing things.
[02:44:16.276 --> 02:44:21.261]  The issue is I can't be here at work because fasting and working does not mix well.
[02:44:21.301 --> 02:44:22.222]  I get pretty angry.
[02:44:22.922 --> 02:44:27.847]  But if I'm hanging out at home or you know just doing stuff with the children it's not as big a deal.
[02:44:27.887 --> 02:44:31.010]  As long as I can drink water and deal with the stomach ache I get day two.
[02:44:33.991 --> 02:44:37.255]  The brain certainly works a lot better than when you're fat, dumb, and happy.
[02:44:37.715 --> 02:44:38.816]  That's why they've got terms like that.
[02:44:38.897 --> 02:44:40.558]  Okay, I want to go to Jason in Germany.
[02:44:40.939 --> 02:44:42.441]  And by the way, everybody's been holding an hour?
[02:44:44.312 --> 02:44:57.737]  You get whatever you want, a bottle of X2, a bottle of Brain Force, a Trump is my President shirt, whatever it is, one of the items, they're on the site, let's say $30 or less, it's all yours.
[02:44:57.777 --> 02:45:01.178]  Let me just briefly mention that since I'm doing this, this is how we fund our operation.
[02:45:01.539 --> 02:45:05.900]  Believe me, we sell a thousand of Mercola's books, that's not going to fund a news organization of this size.
[02:45:06.901 --> 02:45:09.922]  We're doing it with the Memorial Day special.
[02:45:11.155 --> 02:45:12.276]  That the crew came up with.
[02:45:12.296 --> 02:45:14.999]  And let me tell you, it is one of the biggest specials ever.
[02:45:15.279 --> 02:45:16.861]  We've been having a lot of big specials.
[02:45:18.382 --> 02:45:23.107]  We're talking 65% off silver bullet colloidal silver.
[02:45:23.407 --> 02:45:24.348]  We've never done that.
[02:45:25.461 --> 02:45:27.302]  And this has been sold out for a while.
[02:45:27.362 --> 02:45:28.443]  This stuff just came back in.
[02:45:28.723 --> 02:45:29.903]  We can sell this full retail.
[02:45:30.544 --> 02:45:38.488]  But I believe in having incredible discounts on high quality products so that you repeat customer want to support us and sign up for AutoShip.
[02:45:38.928 --> 02:45:44.031]  You get an additional 10% off on everything in the store when you sign up for AutoShip.
[02:45:44.071 --> 02:45:46.853]  That makes the Glottal Silver a loss leader.
[02:45:48.233 --> 02:45:49.954]  And by the way, I said almost everything.
[02:45:50.374 --> 02:45:53.036]  Some things you get a 25% off on the entire line.
[02:45:54.360 --> 02:46:13.042]  When you sign up for AutoShip on Enbrix Essentials of personal care products like high-quality non-aluminum deodorant, non-nano zinc-based high-quality sunscreen, 10 to 1 concentrate organic mouthwash,
[02:46:14.690 --> 02:46:18.175]  Body wash, shampoo, and so much more.
[02:46:18.255 --> 02:46:19.838]  Bug spray, all natural.
[02:46:20.218 --> 02:46:21.800]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:46:22.121 --> 02:46:23.423]  And I'm going to have to end that.
[02:46:27.464 --> 02:46:33.909]  25% off on AutoShip soon because they kind of showed me the map, the math the other day and we're not making enough money to operate.
[02:46:33.929 --> 02:46:39.173]  This is one of our main products we're selling and I'm doing 45% off total when you do the AutoShip.
[02:46:39.233 --> 02:46:41.694]  It's 25% off AutoShip, 20% off retail.
[02:46:42.235 --> 02:46:45.557]  So that limited time introductory offer is going to have to end probably the next week or so.
[02:46:45.857 --> 02:46:46.578]  Take advantage of it.
[02:46:46.638 --> 02:46:50.160]  Infowarrestore.com or AAA2533139.
[02:46:50.561 --> 02:46:52.342]  But I'm going to Jason in Germany just first.
[02:46:53.923 --> 02:46:56.045]  We are very excited to announce
[02:46:57.406 --> 02:47:09.083]  This new mega special that we're running on the biggest specials basically ever at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:47:11.601 --> 02:47:13.342]  And that is Silver Bullet, 65% off.
[02:47:13.362 --> 02:47:17.326]  Super Metal Vitality, been out for months, 30% off.
[02:47:17.886 --> 02:47:21.009]  Survival Shield X2, incredible, 40% off.
[02:47:21.769 --> 02:47:24.872]  Brain Force, 47% off, with 20% more in each bottle.
[02:47:25.192 --> 02:47:26.593]  Secret 12, 43% off.
[02:47:26.933 --> 02:47:29.315]  The highest quality organic methylcobalamin.
[02:47:29.696 --> 02:47:30.836]  Knockout, 50% off.
[02:47:30.877 --> 02:47:31.737]  You cannot beat that.
[02:47:32.818 --> 02:47:36.221]  All Trump InfoWars shirts, 75% off.
[02:47:36.801 --> 02:47:38.683]  InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:47:42.677 --> 02:47:46.261]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, I'm changing my life.
[02:47:46.301 --> 02:47:49.083]  I'm not up here on some high horse lecturing you about how to be healthy.
[02:47:49.784 --> 02:47:54.529]  I just know when antibiotics haven't worked for me, I drink a whole bottle of colloidal silver, which by the way is toxic.
[02:47:55.390 --> 02:47:59.174]  The government says small amounts of it are okay and grass certified and all this stuff.
[02:47:59.434 --> 02:48:00.375]  Consult your own physician.
[02:48:00.755 --> 02:48:03.218]  I just know when antibiotics don't work for me or my family,
[02:48:04.181 --> 02:48:05.861]  I take heroic doses of colloidal silver.
[02:48:05.901 --> 02:48:07.002]  I'm not saying you should do that.
[02:48:07.482 --> 02:48:09.142]  I'm just saying it's something good to have in your cupboard.
[02:48:09.402 --> 02:48:10.303]  Topically, you name it.
[02:48:10.603 --> 02:48:10.943]  Silver.
[02:48:11.063 --> 02:48:12.743]  It's what the elites eat off of for a reason.
[02:48:12.783 --> 02:48:14.244]  It's been well known for thousands of years.
[02:48:14.704 --> 02:48:18.645]  And now it's been proven an anti-virus, anti-bacterial, when other stuff isn't working.
[02:48:18.885 --> 02:48:20.125]  Does it mean it works every time?
[02:48:20.145 --> 02:48:24.766]  You gotta experience it for yourself.
[02:48:24.786 --> 02:48:26.827]  This is the reason they call it in lore a silver bullet.
[02:48:28.627 --> 02:48:30.388]  Associated with warding off evil.
[02:48:31.809 --> 02:48:33.931]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:48:34.051 --> 02:48:37.855]  Because the wives' tales are all archetypes of the truth.
[02:48:39.137 --> 02:48:41.099]  Got a problem with a werewolf or a vampire?
[02:48:41.779 --> 02:48:42.160]  Silver.
[02:48:43.501 --> 02:48:45.103]  Infowarslife.com, probably that line.
[02:48:45.143 --> 02:48:46.224]  Jones believes in werewolves.
[02:48:46.644 --> 02:48:53.832]  It's a parallel, an allegory, a parable, an example, a comparison, an analogy.
[02:48:53.932 --> 02:48:54.933]  I don't mean literal.
[02:48:59.445 --> 02:49:02.768]  I mean, I guess vampires are real, aren't they?
[02:49:03.169 --> 02:49:04.050]  They just don't live forever.
[02:49:04.550 --> 02:49:05.231]  Except in hell.
[02:49:06.292 --> 02:49:06.753]  I'm sorry.
[02:49:06.793 --> 02:49:09.175]  Let's go to Jason in Deutschland.
[02:49:09.556 --> 02:49:12.299]  Jason, give us your address if you want it.
[02:49:12.319 --> 02:49:15.242]  We're shipping you whatever you want of one of those items.
[02:49:15.262 --> 02:49:15.883]  Thanks for holding.
[02:49:16.972 --> 02:49:19.854]  It's one of your marvelous people there.
[02:49:20.194 --> 02:49:22.135]  By the way, I don't just call to bug you every once in a while.
[02:49:22.155 --> 02:49:23.396]  I actually do use your products.
[02:49:23.476 --> 02:49:24.437]  I use X2 every day.
[02:49:24.557 --> 02:49:25.558]  Thank you.
[02:49:25.658 --> 02:49:27.139]  And the Silver Bullet, and I love it.
[02:49:27.159 --> 02:49:31.461]  I would actually buy more, except as the guy from Scotland said, you just almost can't get it here.
[02:49:31.501 --> 02:49:35.184]  In fact, at Customs, they won't even give it to me, so I have to go stateside to actually re-up.
[02:49:36.765 --> 02:49:37.205]  Oh, yeah.
[02:49:37.225 --> 02:49:38.746]  I mean, that's another problem that's killed us.
[02:49:38.786 --> 02:49:39.927]  We still ship overseas.
[02:49:41.208 --> 02:49:44.230]  Twenty, thirty percent of the stuff we ship overseas, and we don't even get a letter back.
[02:49:44.250 --> 02:49:45.731]  They just tear it open, steal it.
[02:49:46.860 --> 02:49:47.621]  Throw it in the trash.
[02:49:47.641 --> 02:49:49.462]  We've been told this by customs agents overseas.
[02:49:49.982 --> 02:49:50.883]  I mean, they're out to get us.
[02:49:51.923 --> 02:49:52.804]  That's why I stopped ordering.
[02:49:52.824 --> 02:49:53.804]  I didn't want to put you guys through that.
[02:49:53.824 --> 02:49:55.906]  But also, real quick, I wrote an article.
[02:49:55.926 --> 02:50:03.470]  I don't know if you guys take user submissions, but I sent that to both the writers and Showtips at Infowars.com if you guys are able to review that.
[02:50:04.391 --> 02:50:05.612]  Real quick about the terror attack.
[02:50:06.072 --> 02:50:08.374]  I think it's important to understand exactly what we're dealing with here.
[02:50:08.514 --> 02:50:12.296]  And it's just like you said earlier, it's trauma-based mind control.
[02:50:12.536 --> 02:50:13.076]  That's what it is.
[02:50:14.437 --> 02:50:15.358]  And explain that to people.
[02:50:17.276 --> 02:50:28.624]  Uh, well, I think the elite are using terror as a way to make us feel helpless, and then basically put us in a position to beg them for their 1984-style control grid, which, ironically, will actually not even keep us safe.
[02:50:29.104 --> 02:50:38.611]  Or, just as bad, make us feel outraged enough to actually take it to the streets, and then use that as a pretext for bringing in a draconian kind of surveillance state.
[02:50:39.091 --> 02:50:45.656]  And, uh, we need to be careful not to play into that, because that is the game they're playing, and there are many ways to skin a cat, and we are the cat in this situation.
[02:50:46.036 --> 02:50:46.417]  All right.
[02:50:46.457 --> 02:50:47.739]  Well, hey, send us a resume.
[02:50:47.759 --> 02:50:48.942]  You should be a radio host for us.
[02:50:48.962 --> 02:50:50.364]  I'm about to launch a larger radio network.
[02:50:50.705 --> 02:50:51.907]  I'll work with GCN if they want to.
[02:50:51.927 --> 02:50:52.969]  Thank you, Jason.
[02:50:55.534 --> 02:50:57.718]  Imagine the world without impulse.
[02:51:01.082 --> 02:51:03.083]  The globalists have already consolidated their power.
[02:51:03.603 --> 02:51:07.284]  They don't want people to have their own economies, their own choices.
[02:51:08.004 --> 02:51:21.329]  When you spread the links to Infowars.com news stories and our videos, when you tell friends, family, and neighbors about our free iPhone and Droid apps, or send them a link to our daily podcast, you are involved in a revolutionary act against tyranny.
[02:51:21.749 --> 02:51:26.911]  It was George Orwell that said, in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[02:51:27.671 --> 02:51:38.916]  That's why I spend a lot of time trying to not just innovate news and analysis and our fight against the globalists, but also thinking about how we're able to fund our operation.
[02:51:39.196 --> 02:51:41.717]  That's so critical to prosecute an information war.
[02:51:42.917 --> 02:51:57.877]  And I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic and high quality.
[02:51:58.257 --> 02:52:00.400]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we have private labeled it.
[02:52:01.767 --> 02:52:14.137]  And it is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emrix Essentials, and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from InfoWareStore.com.
[02:52:14.938 --> 02:52:23.565]  On top of that, if you sign up for AutoShip, you get an additional, out of the gates, 25% off on this product.
[02:52:24.145 --> 02:52:29.250]  Emrix Essentials is all about personal care, hygiene, not getting skin cancer.
[02:52:29.790 --> 02:52:33.455]  Not getting bit by a bunch of bugs and gnats and mosquitoes.
[02:52:33.955 --> 02:52:34.936]  It's all there.
[02:52:35.097 --> 02:52:39.162]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash.
[02:52:39.622 --> 02:52:41.705]  All of it is truly game-changing.
[02:52:42.225 --> 02:52:43.006]  Be-A-Way Spray.
[02:52:43.327 --> 02:52:45.309]  Totally organic, essential oils.
[02:52:46.050 --> 02:52:49.592]  Works a lot better than the toxic chemical systems that are out there.
[02:52:49.973 --> 02:52:52.254]  And it is comparable in price.
[02:52:52.554 --> 02:52:53.975]  And again, it's concentrated.
[02:52:54.316 --> 02:52:55.737]  The deodorant is amazing.
[02:52:56.197 --> 02:52:56.877]  High quality.
[02:52:57.558 --> 02:52:59.099]  Doesn't have the aluminum garbage in it.
[02:52:59.399 --> 02:53:00.119]  Totally natural.
[02:53:00.400 --> 02:53:00.900]  Works great.
[02:53:01.821 --> 02:53:04.662]  SPF 30 face and body lotion sunscreen.
[02:53:05.063 --> 02:53:05.603]  Unscented.
[02:53:06.143 --> 02:53:07.104]  This is exciting.
[02:53:07.204 --> 02:53:10.887]  Because so many of the so-called sunscreens that are out there are toxic.
[02:53:11.367 --> 02:53:13.348]  As everyone knows, I'm obsessed with Win-Wins.
[02:53:13.368 --> 02:53:14.089]  20% off what it is retail.
[02:53:16.390 --> 02:53:21.151]  Because we cut out the middleman, and then additionally, we sign up for auto-ship out of the gates.
[02:53:21.171 --> 02:53:25.413]  25% off that, because I want you to try these products.
[02:53:25.553 --> 02:53:26.793]  I want you to love these products.
[02:53:27.133 --> 02:53:37.756]  I want to have a deeper relationship with you in a 360 win, a non-zero-sum game, where you get high quality, you get value, and you repeat order something you need every month.
[02:53:38.636 --> 02:53:46.260]  And then we're able to secure our funding into the future to not just stay at the level we're at, but to grow in the face of enemy attacks.
[02:53:46.541 --> 02:53:51.163]  InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, and you'll find Emmerich's Essentials.
[02:54:06.221 --> 02:54:07.202]  Okay folks, we're back.
[02:54:07.222 --> 02:54:11.885]  I'm going to do this segment the next and then Paul Watson from London will have a lot more on the bombing and the attack.
[02:54:12.485 --> 02:54:14.727]  And again, we know the Globalists are working with Islam.
[02:54:14.747 --> 02:54:15.787]  We know they're bringing them in.
[02:54:16.328 --> 02:54:24.813]  It's just to watch the media cover it up and then demonize anybody that exposes it and then act like it's our fault because we don't submit to Islam this is happening.
[02:54:25.113 --> 02:54:26.014]  It just makes me angry.
[02:54:27.881 --> 02:54:29.261]  And I don't want to kill the Muslims.
[02:54:29.341 --> 02:54:30.582]  I don't want to be in wars with them.
[02:54:31.002 --> 02:54:35.823]  But our governments overthrow the secular governments and then put the baddies in.
[02:54:36.424 --> 02:54:39.024]  So I hope Saudi Arabia has turned some corner with Trump.
[02:54:40.485 --> 02:54:41.785]  If Trump delivers, I'll be happy.
[02:54:41.825 --> 02:54:42.846]  If he doesn't, I'm going to hate him.
[02:54:43.886 --> 02:54:45.006]  But it all remains to be seen.
[02:54:45.506 --> 02:54:47.367]  O'Brien in Maryland, you're on the air.
[02:54:47.387 --> 02:54:47.987]  Thanks for holding.
[02:54:48.007 --> 02:54:48.387]  Go ahead.
[02:54:51.508 --> 02:54:56.950]  Yeah, basically what we have to also look at is the fact that maybe
[02:54:57.731 --> 02:55:05.234]  Basically, they keep telling us that this is all going to happen and it just keeps happening.
[02:55:05.314 --> 02:55:09.936]  It's almost like having someone say, I'm going to do this, this, and this.
[02:55:10.799 --> 02:55:12.260]  And that's exactly what it is.
[02:55:33.254 --> 02:55:34.255]  God bless you, O'Brien.
[02:55:34.375 --> 02:55:36.938]  You know, I'll tell you, I was thinking about the last caller.
[02:55:36.958 --> 02:55:40.201]  I was saying, hey, you're in Germany, I'm going to send you a free bottle of something for holding over an hour.
[02:55:40.521 --> 02:55:43.444]  It's a good promo on air, but it also, I feel bad for folks that have been holding too long.
[02:55:44.385 --> 02:55:47.588]  And so I want to encourage good callers to call in, and it's uncool what I do sometimes.
[02:55:47.628 --> 02:55:48.289]  Let's just be honest.
[02:55:48.689 --> 02:55:51.392]  But I get caught up in the time and the guests and everything else.
[02:55:52.816 --> 02:55:59.520]  I was thinking about why did I ever get an Amazon account even though they bend you over the barrel and make you pay them huge percentages and it's not even profitable.
[02:56:00.140 --> 02:56:08.725]  And it's because we never have problems shipping Amazon packages into Russia or into Germany or into Japan or into Mexico or into wherever.
[02:56:09.266 --> 02:56:12.468]  But Canada and the EU really are horrible.
[02:56:13.068 --> 02:56:17.611]  And they put, they grab your stuff and make you come get it from customs with a 90% markup.
[02:56:17.971 --> 02:56:19.732]  America doesn't do that to other people's stuff.
[02:56:20.232 --> 02:56:21.133]  It's so uncool.
[02:56:22.059 --> 02:56:25.063]  To that extent, you know, there's some tariffs, some regulations.
[02:56:26.865 --> 02:56:29.068]  I just thought, that's why I should be on Amazon.
[02:56:29.108 --> 02:56:31.010]  But see, Amazon's the globalist.
[02:56:31.070 --> 02:56:32.151]  It's the big company.
[02:56:32.692 --> 02:56:34.314]  It gives money to the foreign governments.
[02:56:34.394 --> 02:56:35.275]  It's liberal.
[02:56:35.676 --> 02:56:40.542]  So it gets to ship in and not get torn open and not have all the fees added on most of the time.
[02:56:42.841 --> 02:56:45.202]  Because we'll fill out the forms right, we'll do it all.
[02:56:45.642 --> 02:56:47.442]  We'll do it through FedEx, you name it.
[02:56:47.542 --> 02:56:49.403]  They tear it open a third of the time.
[02:56:49.663 --> 02:56:50.383]  They steal it.
[02:56:51.184 --> 02:56:52.584]  And don't even send it back to us.
[02:56:56.565 --> 02:57:01.647]  So I just throw product up against a wall, but I still just do it.
[02:57:01.667 --> 02:57:04.448]  Because I'm pig-headed.
[02:57:05.308 --> 02:57:08.929]  But maybe I should just roll over to Amazon and be anti-gun, anti-family.
[02:57:10.890 --> 02:57:11.850]  Chop my balls off.
[02:57:13.835 --> 02:57:15.016]  Just worship world government.
[02:57:15.076 --> 02:57:16.456]  I mean, I'm sorry to talk like that.
[02:57:16.496 --> 02:57:21.638]  It's just, at a certain point, it's just, why are the people running things so uncool?
[02:57:22.398 --> 02:57:24.179]  Because they're greedy bastards, that's why.
[02:57:26.300 --> 02:57:28.341]  Dan in Indiana, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:57:31.042 --> 02:57:31.402]  Hello?
[02:57:31.422 --> 02:57:32.102]  Hey, brother.
[02:57:32.622 --> 02:57:32.922]  Yeah.
[02:57:33.583 --> 02:57:33.843]  Yeah.
[02:57:34.923 --> 02:57:38.705]  I want to say, this is Dan Sanders, not Alex Jones, or
[02:57:40.501 --> 02:57:58.395]  President Trump, but it is time for eye for eye and let God sort out the terrorists from the innocent because it's time for the British people to get up some balls and go out there and start lynching these bastards.
[02:58:01.557 --> 02:58:02.358]  Well, I know this.
[02:58:03.939 --> 02:58:05.780]  Your phone's ringing up real bad, but I hear what you're saying.
[02:58:05.841 --> 02:58:08.443]  How about just go after the known Islamic leaders calling for violence?
[02:58:09.764 --> 02:58:10.184]  How about that?
[02:58:16.033 --> 02:58:25.425]  They need to go out and be men and take some swords or whatever they have and fight to the finish, you know, because they're being walked all over.
[02:58:25.990 --> 02:58:33.134]  No, I hear you, Dan, and I'm not saying we should do that, but the point is if the government doesn't respond, it's going to lead to that point, Dan.
[02:58:33.554 --> 02:58:37.536]  Stay there, we're going to get your info if you want to get a t-shirt or X2 or whatever you want.
[02:58:37.796 --> 02:58:38.336]  Thanks for holding.
[02:58:38.356 --> 02:58:40.357]  We're going to come back in the third, fourth hour.
[02:58:40.377 --> 02:58:42.178]  I'm going to finish up with Trevor and Cindy.
[02:58:42.638 --> 02:58:44.539]  I mean, Dan asked the big question, everybody's asking.
[02:58:45.960 --> 02:58:50.022]  This is the InfoWars PowerPak, and it can start your car if it has a dead battery.
[02:58:51.892 --> 02:58:54.573]  And now we're going to use the Power Pack to jumpstart this truck.
[02:58:54.993 --> 02:58:55.954]  And we're going to show you!
[02:58:56.394 --> 02:58:57.674]  Switch on the Power Pack.
[02:58:58.335 --> 02:59:01.196]  Wait a few minutes, and then you'll be able to start your car.
[02:59:01.876 --> 02:59:07.058]  With just a few minutes on the Infowars Battery Pack, you go from a dead battery to this.
[02:59:13.655 --> 02:59:16.398]  You get all that cranking power in this little brick!
[02:59:16.698 --> 02:59:22.684]  The Info Wars Power Pack is a must-have, and it'll give you peace of mind whether you're at home or on the go.
[02:59:23.264 --> 02:59:28.690]  It's so compact, it'll fit in your backpack, your glove box, or even your back pocket.
[02:59:29.090 --> 02:59:33.875]  Get one for your home, boat, car, camping setup, or just for emergencies.
[02:59:34.375 --> 02:59:44.663]  Secure your peace of mind today and order your Info Wars Power Pack from InfoWarsStore.com or dial 1-888-253-3139 and order today!
[02:59:48.066 --> 02:59:53.971]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[03:00:06.858 --> 03:00:09.219]  Again, it's not the Muslims.
[03:00:10.099 --> 03:00:18.883]  It's this big collapse, this big setup, this big waging war on corruption.
[03:00:18.923 --> 03:00:19.383]  Clash!
[03:00:19.663 --> 03:00:24.785]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:00:26.184 --> 03:00:27.305]  I mean who could think this up?
[03:00:27.325 --> 03:00:45.716]  Like aliens that run the planet and it's like a crazy video game where there's a planet and then you give like super backwards people that have women as slaves and run sex slavery half the oil on the planet and the British find it and then make them the richest people in the world and then now they're like sending out people all over the world as missionaries that blow you up and kill you.
[03:00:47.917 --> 03:00:50.419]  And look, other orthodox religions have done bad things as well.
[03:00:50.579 --> 03:00:51.940]  I don't want to kill Muslims
[03:00:53.112 --> 03:01:00.475]  I just know that our governments are working with them and allowing this to happen, and it's wrong, and those of us that criticize it are attacked.
[03:01:01.076 --> 03:01:05.458]  I used to be brainwashed 15 years ago and would get mad if you criticized Muslims.
[03:01:05.858 --> 03:01:10.460]  I knew they were backward and had problems, but I didn't want to go bomb them and stuff.
[03:01:10.480 --> 03:01:13.821]  I guess I was right because that stirred them up, but there was a larger plan.
[03:01:14.322 --> 03:01:19.424]  The same people bombing them are the ones putting the radicals in charge and then opening our borders up to them.
[03:01:19.484 --> 03:01:21.425]  So what's the big master plan?
[03:01:22.225 --> 03:01:25.127]  Trevor in Canada, then Cindy in Pennsylvania.
[03:01:25.167 --> 03:01:25.968]  Trevor, you're on the air.
[03:01:27.549 --> 03:01:28.270]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[03:01:28.370 --> 03:01:28.770]  Good, brother.
[03:01:30.151 --> 03:01:38.017]  Hey, I just want to chat about how on earth you have a reformation in Islam when the roots of it are so poisonous.
[03:01:38.498 --> 03:01:42.681]  How do you, like, there's been reformations like the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and all that stuff.
[03:01:43.161 --> 03:01:46.764]  I don't understand how you can reform something that has poisonous roots to it.
[03:01:47.865 --> 03:01:48.666]  No, I hear you.
[03:01:48.766 --> 03:01:49.967]  I mean, I gotta be honest with you.
[03:01:52.381 --> 03:01:53.022]  So what do we do?
[03:01:53.082 --> 03:01:54.423]  We got a billion and a half of these people.
[03:01:54.443 --> 03:01:54.823]  What do you do?
[03:01:56.605 --> 03:01:57.645]  That's the real question.
[03:01:58.506 --> 03:02:05.612]  At least something you gotta, you know, anything that doesn't coincide with Western values is something that shouldn't be around.
[03:02:06.693 --> 03:02:07.313]  Well, here's the deal.
[03:02:07.353 --> 03:02:08.574]  They can have their countries.
[03:02:09.477 --> 03:02:12.020]  It's just that they're obsessed with taking everything over.
[03:02:12.040 --> 03:02:13.882]  That's why they're constantly killing each other.
[03:02:14.202 --> 03:02:16.405]  Because they're not an open, free society.
[03:02:16.605 --> 03:02:22.352]  Then they use our openness and our freedom to ally with the left to then try to get rid of our openness and freedom.
[03:02:23.092 --> 03:02:25.956]  It's just, there's no logic to the feminists in people.
[03:02:26.536 --> 03:02:28.539]  Except they're just a bunch of white flag cowards.
[03:02:30.424 --> 03:02:30.964]  Well, no kidding.
[03:02:31.025 --> 03:02:39.392]  Look, they're with them promoting the hijab and everything when the hijab's origins were to differentiate between your wives and your sex slave.
[03:02:39.692 --> 03:02:43.055]  I don't understand how they could promote something like that as a feminist, so-called.
[03:02:43.395 --> 03:02:43.755]  That's right.
[03:02:43.776 --> 03:02:47.279]  For folks that don't know the history, why don't you tell them about the difference between a wife and a sex slave?
[03:02:47.479 --> 03:02:48.139]  Who wore what?
[03:02:50.121 --> 03:02:51.242]  I forget which is which.
[03:02:51.302 --> 03:02:51.882]  I believe it was
[03:02:53.384 --> 03:02:54.185]  I don't know.
[03:03:03.946 --> 03:03:07.027]  Uh, referring to between, differentiating between wives and sex slaves.
[03:03:07.287 --> 03:03:15.689]  Well, imagine if a black guy or a Hispanic guy or a white guy, Christian, whatever, said, you're going to wear a hood over your head, I'm going to cut your genitals off.
[03:03:15.989 --> 03:03:17.110]  People put you in prison.
[03:03:17.630 --> 03:03:19.130]  You'd say, oh yeah, his wife was a slave.
[03:03:19.630 --> 03:03:19.810]  What?
[03:03:19.951 --> 03:03:21.931]  I mean, it's like ridiculous.
[03:03:22.591 --> 03:03:23.411]  We should reject it.
[03:03:23.431 --> 03:03:23.972]  Thank you, Trevor.
[03:03:23.992 --> 03:03:24.492]  Great points.
[03:03:25.812 --> 03:03:27.673]  Cindy in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[03:03:28.913 --> 03:03:29.133]  Hi.
[03:03:29.613 --> 03:03:30.133]  Hi, Alex.
[03:03:30.253 --> 03:03:31.454]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:03:31.534 --> 03:03:31.814]  Thank you.
[03:03:33.089 --> 03:03:36.692]  Thanks for that segment with Tommy Robinson.
[03:03:36.852 --> 03:03:39.294]  What amazing bravery that man has.
[03:03:39.534 --> 03:03:40.155]  He does.
[03:03:40.235 --> 03:03:42.977]  I think we all need to get behind him.
[03:03:43.177 --> 03:03:46.039]  I've been racking my brain because he's in so much danger.
[03:03:46.059 --> 03:03:49.522]  I mean, I watched him with the frustration in him.
[03:03:49.602 --> 03:03:50.943]  It just made me cry.
[03:03:51.603 --> 03:03:54.746]  But I had one idea of a t-shirt.
[03:03:55.146 --> 03:04:00.010]  Tommy Robinson with a picture of his face with it begins with one.
[03:04:00.632 --> 03:04:03.714]  I'm not a rich person, but if I was, I would put that out.
[03:04:04.635 --> 03:04:07.597]  Oh, with Robinson, doesn't the sincerity come right across?
[03:04:07.657 --> 03:04:08.838]  Very, very strong.
[03:04:09.258 --> 03:04:11.920]  He really has been the Paul Revere in the UK in the last 15 years.
[03:04:16.183 --> 03:04:17.965]  Anything else, Cindy?
[03:04:18.465 --> 03:04:18.865]  Pardon me?
[03:04:19.145 --> 03:04:20.166]  I'm sorry, your phone cut out.
[03:04:20.186 --> 03:04:20.466]  Go ahead.
[03:04:22.047 --> 03:04:26.691]  If we had just a hundred of him, what we could do?
[03:04:27.658 --> 03:04:29.419]  But I would love to see a t-shirt.
[03:04:29.580 --> 03:04:31.741]  It begins with one, Tommy Robinson.
[03:04:31.821 --> 03:04:33.823]  He needs bodyguards or something.
[03:04:34.243 --> 03:04:35.384]  I fear for his safety.
[03:04:35.444 --> 03:04:36.404]  Well, he's been in prison.
[03:04:36.444 --> 03:04:37.105]  They beat him up.
[03:04:37.685 --> 03:04:39.366]  I mean, the guys, it's crazy.
[03:04:39.767 --> 03:04:40.767]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[03:04:41.508 --> 03:04:44.410]  One reason I started becoming anti-Islam was going to Europe and England.
[03:04:44.910 --> 03:04:47.732]  And man, they just get in your face like you are a dog.
[03:04:47.852 --> 03:04:49.694]  Because they're so used to the Brits rolling over.
[03:04:50.634 --> 03:04:52.315]  And I'm just like, what on earth?
[03:04:52.376 --> 03:04:54.097]  Paul Watson's coming up, speaking of the Brits.
[03:04:55.794 --> 03:05:06.437]  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[03:05:06.757 --> 03:05:13.539]  That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.
[03:05:13.799 --> 03:05:22.942]  That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government.
[03:05:24.602 --> 03:05:26.122]  Independence isn't a day.
[03:05:26.402 --> 03:05:27.183]  It's a mindset.
[03:05:27.443 --> 03:05:30.103]  An attitude that says, I will not be your dependent.
[03:05:30.203 --> 03:05:31.503]  I will not be your slave.
[03:05:31.803 --> 03:05:37.345]  Dependence and slavery is a chain that is forged link by link with gradual infringements.
[03:05:37.885 --> 03:05:42.106]  When you trade your liberty for safety, to that extent, you become their slave.
[03:05:42.826 --> 03:05:44.266]  Slaves are never safe.
[03:05:44.726 --> 03:05:47.027]  You won't get rich by being a slave.
[03:05:47.707 --> 03:05:48.427]  Guard your liberty.
[03:05:48.807 --> 03:05:51.567]  Regard with suspicion anyone who tries to take it.
[03:05:52.168 --> 03:05:54.048]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:05:55.484 --> 03:06:03.628]  Our fellow Infowarriors across the United States and across the planet really love the Hillary for Prison 2016 shirts that we began to put out in 2015.
[03:06:04.588 --> 03:06:09.230]  It became a global meme against globalism and corruption.
[03:06:09.811 --> 03:06:13.412]  And a very strong maxim that's now being continued on today.
[03:06:13.813 --> 03:06:17.674]  So we now have George Soros, because the media attacked me on this whole goblin meme.
[03:06:17.754 --> 03:06:20.736]  They've made huge jokes about it, but it's totally blown up their face.
[03:06:20.756 --> 03:06:22.257]  We now have George Soros
[03:06:23.357 --> 03:06:24.118]  As a goblin.
[03:06:24.778 --> 03:06:30.561]  On the back, and it says, with a cross through him, you know, an X, like Ghostbusters, no Soros, him as a goblin.
[03:06:31.302 --> 03:06:36.444]  It says, deport Soros on the bottom, and on the top it says, InfoWars established 1996.
[03:06:37.925 --> 03:06:45.009]  So, it is a limited edition, deport Soros on the back, Hillary for President on the front, right-hand shoulder, InfoWars.com.
[03:06:45.369 --> 03:06:45.950]  It's powerful.
[03:06:45.970 --> 03:06:46.990]  Hope you get out to everybody you know.
[03:06:47.270 --> 03:06:49.011]  InfoWarsStore.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[03:06:59.642 --> 03:07:01.144]  There is a crisis in America today.
[03:07:01.604 --> 03:07:04.006]  Tens of millions of us are addicted to cell phones.
[03:07:04.327 --> 03:07:11.734]  These little devices, according to many university studies and more, cause health risks such as depression, cancer, and social anxiety.
[03:07:12.114 --> 03:07:15.718]  How can we prevent these harmful devices from harming us and our families?
[03:07:16.078 --> 03:07:17.239]  I have the answer for you today.
[03:07:17.640 --> 03:07:18.801]  It's called the Blocking Pocket.
[03:07:19.537 --> 03:07:24.840]  The Block It Pocket works by securing your phone in a safe, no-radiation compartment.
[03:07:25.280 --> 03:07:31.023]  I use the Block It Pocket every day to protect me from harmful radiation and prevent others from stealing my stuff.

[03:08:08.391 --> 03:08:09.132]  Big Brother.
[03:08:09.512 --> 03:08:10.753]  Mainstream media.
[03:08:11.313 --> 03:08:12.414]  Government cover-ups.
[03:08:13.275 --> 03:08:14.636]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:08:14.916 --> 03:08:16.097]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:16.577 --> 03:08:21.081]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:22.322 --> 03:08:31.629]  We are live at the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show with me, Paul Joseph-Watts, and now obviously we've spoken at length about
[03:08:32.478 --> 03:08:35.459]  The tragedy that happened last night in Manchester, England.
[03:08:35.479 --> 03:08:36.880]  We're going to get more into that.
[03:08:36.920 --> 03:08:41.941]  We're also going to cover the situation in Libya or just off the coast of Libya.
[03:08:42.361 --> 03:08:45.883]  And this is what most people don't realise about the quote, refugee crisis.
[03:08:46.103 --> 03:08:48.404]  It's not a refugee crisis.
[03:08:48.804 --> 03:08:55.326]  As people hold up the refugee welcome signs, they don't even scratch one inch below the surface.
[03:08:55.846 --> 03:09:03.870]  We're talking about these NGO boats literally going 12 miles off the coast of Libya to pick up migrants.
[03:09:04.371 --> 03:09:18.538]  Some of whom have been paid by ISIS to cover their fee that they pay the people smugglers to get across the Mediterranean with the NGOs being in illegal communication with the people smugglers.
[03:09:19.158 --> 03:09:21.660]  Most people have no idea that this is going on.
[03:09:21.920 --> 03:09:23.961]  It's something that we can stop
[03:09:24.705 --> 03:09:30.047]  If we know the details, if we support the parties that are trying to stop it there in Italy.
[03:09:30.407 --> 03:09:32.788]  So I'm going to get into a detailed breakdown about that.
[03:09:33.629 --> 03:09:35.830]  And obviously we're talking about what happened in Manchester.
[03:09:35.870 --> 03:09:44.053]  Now to set the table for Manchester, this video just went up about an hour ago on YouTube and on Infowars.com.
[03:09:44.133 --> 03:09:47.615]  It is Manchester attack, what they're not telling you.
[03:09:47.715 --> 03:09:48.375]  Here's the video.
[03:09:48.855 --> 03:09:56.937]  Europe has been hit with yet another terrorist atrocity after at least 22 people were killed in an attack on the Manchester Arena claimed by ISIS.
[03:09:57.037 --> 03:10:00.438]  The second attack on the UK in the space of two months.
[03:10:00.638 --> 03:10:05.159]  Victims, many of them teenage girls, massacred, mutilated, maimed.
[03:10:05.279 --> 03:10:06.840]  Why does this keep happening?
[03:10:06.920 --> 03:10:16.122]  Because our political class has demoted the most basic role of government to protect the lives of its people and replaced it with a different role.
[03:10:16.562 --> 03:10:17.283]  Tolerance.
[03:10:17.563 --> 03:10:20.346]  Tolerance of women being abused and harassed on the street.
[03:10:20.406 --> 03:10:24.470]  Tolerance of rape gangs abducting and abusing young girls for years.
[03:10:24.570 --> 03:10:27.232]  Tolerance of all the barbarisms of Sharia law.
[03:10:27.252 --> 03:10:29.214]  Tolerance of terrorist attacks.
[03:10:29.334 --> 03:10:33.698]  Tolerance is now more important than the basic right to life.
[03:10:33.939 --> 03:10:34.619]  Tolerance.
[03:10:34.879 --> 03:10:40.525]  Tolerance of terror being part and parcel of living in a major city according to London Mayor Sadiq Khan.
[03:10:40.865 --> 03:10:42.786]  Europe is getting used to attacks like this, Mika.
[03:10:43.007 --> 03:10:43.667]  We have to.
[03:10:43.707 --> 03:10:46.229]  There's only one way Britain should respond to attacks such as Manchester.
[03:10:46.329 --> 03:10:48.611]  That is by carrying on exactly as before.
[03:10:48.651 --> 03:10:49.471]  Just carry on.
[03:10:49.911 --> 03:10:50.772]  Forget about it.
[03:10:51.112 --> 03:10:51.973]  Be tolerant.
[03:10:52.273 --> 03:10:53.834]  Until it happens again.
[03:10:54.234 --> 03:10:54.735]  And again.
[03:10:55.175 --> 03:10:55.676]  And again.
[03:10:55.736 --> 03:11:00.519]  Tell me, how do the parents of dead kids just carry on exactly as before?
[03:11:00.619 --> 03:11:06.283]  How do the teenage girls whose legs have been blown off just carry on exactly as before?
[03:11:06.383 --> 03:11:12.049]  As much as I'm praying for Manchester, I'm praying for Muslims who have to deal with racism and Islamophobia due to this tragedy.
[03:11:12.089 --> 03:11:16.593]  Right, so that's what our main concern should be after dozens of children have been blown up.
[03:11:16.873 --> 03:11:18.855]  People being mean to Muslims.
[03:11:19.055 --> 03:11:21.458]  As a society, we need to make a choice.
[03:11:21.618 --> 03:11:23.320]  Which do we value more?
[03:11:23.640 --> 03:11:28.745]  Protecting the feelings of Muslims or preventing our children from being blown up?
[03:11:28.985 --> 03:11:34.928]  Muslims are to blame when in reality Muslim taxi drivers are offering free lifts and a Muslim doctor working into the night saving lives.
[03:11:35.028 --> 03:11:42.231]  Yeah, the fact that some Muslim taxi drivers are offering free lifts doesn't negate the fact that Islam has a problem with violence.
[03:11:42.331 --> 03:11:43.952]  You utter moron!
[03:11:44.192 --> 03:11:46.853]  Islamophobia and sickening fake news is right.
[03:11:46.913 --> 03:11:50.315]  Tonight is showing a lot of people to be vile humans.
[03:11:50.555 --> 03:11:56.538]  Yeah, vile humans follow a belief system that justifies massacring teenagers at a pop concert.
[03:11:56.598 --> 03:12:02.063]  Should we concentrate on stopping them or be more angry at inaccurate tweets?
[03:12:02.243 --> 03:12:06.867]  Seeing all the posts about Manchester just reminds me of how we only notice it if it happens to white people.
[03:12:07.107 --> 03:12:13.653]  Right, so the main complaint should be all those disgusting white people demanding attention for being slaughtered.
[03:12:14.033 --> 03:12:14.993]  How dare they?
[03:12:15.133 --> 03:12:21.455]  And in these times of our children being blown to bits by terrorists, it's vital to point out the real danger.
[03:12:21.655 --> 03:12:23.555]  Katie Hopkins' offensive tweets.
[03:12:23.575 --> 03:12:25.516]  Being angry at Tommy Robinson.
[03:12:25.616 --> 03:12:26.876]  That's more important.
[03:12:26.976 --> 03:12:33.258]  I've come to realise that a lot of this hashtag pray for whatever concern signalling is worse than glib.
[03:12:33.538 --> 03:12:35.678]  It's repugnant narcissism.
[03:12:35.738 --> 03:12:37.779]  People who see something horrible happen in the world,
[03:12:38.732 --> 03:12:48.716]  And they run to the internet, and they run to their social media, their Facebook, their Twitter, whatever they got, and they all write down the exact same thing.
[03:12:51.597 --> 03:12:52.697]  My thoughts and prayers.
[03:12:55.578 --> 03:12:57.939]  My thoughts and prayers with the people in Aurora.
[03:12:58.779 --> 03:13:01.200]  My thoughts and prayers with the families in Boston.
[03:13:02.621 --> 03:13:03.661]  Do you know what that's worth?
[03:13:03.681 --> 03:13:05.842]  F*** nothing.
[03:13:08.797 --> 03:13:10.378]  Fucking less than nothing.
[03:13:13.439 --> 03:13:14.219]  Less than nothing.
[03:13:15.499 --> 03:13:18.720]  You are not giving any of your time, your money, or even your compassion.
[03:13:19.141 --> 03:13:22.802]  All you are doing, all you are doing is saying,
[03:13:23.922 --> 03:13:25.342]  Don't forget about me today.
[03:13:25.482 --> 03:13:28.543]  Your thoughts and prayers count for nothing.
[03:13:28.763 --> 03:13:31.703]  CNN's Jake Tapper posting a Union Jack.
[03:13:31.783 --> 03:13:37.925]  Hey Jake, I don't recall you posting a Russian flag when all those innocent people got blown up in the St.
[03:13:37.985 --> 03:13:39.825]  Petersburg subway last month.
[03:13:39.905 --> 03:13:45.446]  Was political correctness to blame for one of the accomplices in the attack escaping detection?
[03:13:45.506 --> 03:13:51.507]  This eyewitness says she spotted a woman acting suspiciously and told security, but they did nothing.
[03:13:51.727 --> 03:13:52.827]  Looked very suspicious.
[03:13:53.268 --> 03:13:57.549]  She was fidgeting all the time with a bag on the floor across her.
[03:13:57.910 --> 03:13:58.870]  She was by herself.
[03:14:00.371 --> 03:14:00.991]  What was she doing?
[03:14:02.812 --> 03:14:08.614]  She was looking in the direction of where the explosion actually happened all night and smirking to herself.
[03:14:08.734 --> 03:14:13.636]  The suspicious individual was hard to understand, suggesting English wasn't her first language.
[03:14:13.736 --> 03:14:20.059]  The woman who reported the incident was then lectured for making the suspicious individual feel uncomfortable.
[03:14:20.498 --> 03:14:22.659]  How would you like it if someone accused you of this?
[03:14:23.840 --> 03:14:24.621]  We'll look into it.
[03:14:25.081 --> 03:14:26.282]  And nothing was done about it.
[03:14:26.342 --> 03:14:29.644]  One to two minutes before the concert finished, this lady disappeared.
[03:14:30.604 --> 03:14:32.405]  And then, of course, the explosion went off.
[03:14:32.506 --> 03:14:41.031]  Is she suggesting that security did nothing because the suspicious individual was Muslim, and to ask her to leave would have been politically incorrect?
[03:14:41.331 --> 03:14:42.132]  We'll never know.
[03:14:42.252 --> 03:14:43.713]  What we do know is this.
[03:14:43.973 --> 03:14:46.435]  Almost certainly, nothing will change.
[03:14:46.495 --> 03:14:48.076]  There are things we can change.
[03:14:48.216 --> 03:14:50.398]  Mass surveillance of hate-preaching mosques.
[03:14:50.558 --> 03:14:54.841]  Solitary confinement of individuals who are likely to radicalise others in prison.
[03:14:54.981 --> 03:14:59.204]  Extreme vetting and strict quotas on Muslim immigration.
[03:14:59.244 --> 03:15:01.006]  Deporting known terrorists.
[03:15:01.106 --> 03:15:10.092]  Prosecuting NGOs who send out boats to rescue unvetted migrants, some of whom sympathise with or are members of ISIS.
[03:15:10.172 --> 03:15:10.533]  But again,
[03:15:11.053 --> 03:15:21.379]  Nothing is going to change because we have a political class and a culture that deems hurt feelings to be of more concern than mangled dead children.
[03:15:21.399 --> 03:15:24.682]  90% of terror victims are Muslims, killed by other Muslims.
[03:15:24.922 --> 03:15:26.983]  This is the culture we're importing.
[03:15:27.023 --> 03:15:33.367]  Just 34% of British Muslims would inform police if they knew someone was getting involved with ISIS.
[03:15:34.307 --> 03:15:40.489]  32% refused to condemn those who take part in violence against those who mock the Prophet Muhammad.
[03:15:40.809 --> 03:15:46.511]  1 in 4 British Muslims believe that the 7-7 attacks in London were justified.
[03:15:46.731 --> 03:15:55.514]  ISIS fighters are returning from Syria and flooding into Europe en masse under cover of the refugee wave and European countries are welcoming them in.
[03:15:55.674 --> 03:15:57.095]  Because tolerance!
[03:15:57.275 --> 03:15:58.255]  This is tolerance.
[03:15:58.395 --> 03:15:59.695]  This is diversity.
[03:15:59.876 --> 03:16:03.157]  This is the future our leaders have chosen for us.
[03:16:03.177 --> 03:16:04.837]  But we have a choice.
[03:16:05.157 --> 03:16:06.078]  We have hope.
[03:16:06.198 --> 03:16:08.479]  Don't let them tell you not to be angry.
[03:16:08.739 --> 03:16:12.000]  Don't let them tell you to just go on with life as normal.
[03:16:12.200 --> 03:16:13.761]  Because that's not bravery.
[03:16:14.101 --> 03:16:15.021]  It's cowardice.
[03:16:15.221 --> 03:16:16.482]  Enough hashtags.
[03:16:16.802 --> 03:16:17.902]  Enough vigils.
[03:16:18.202 --> 03:16:20.443]  Enough celebrity platitudes.
[03:16:20.783 --> 03:16:22.165]  It hasn't worked!
[03:16:22.325 --> 03:16:23.286]  We need change.
[03:16:23.566 --> 03:16:24.887]  We need action.
[03:16:24.987 --> 03:16:26.809]  Hope has two beautiful daughters.
[03:16:27.009 --> 03:16:29.271]  Their names are Anger and Courage.
[03:16:29.812 --> 03:16:35.718]  Anger at the way things are, and Courage to see that they do not remain as they are.
[03:16:37.737 --> 03:16:41.339]  And that is what they're not telling you about the Manchester attack.
[03:16:41.379 --> 03:16:51.726]  Now I mentioned there in the video, everyone made a huge deal about, oh there were some Muslim taxi drivers who were offering free lifts to the people trying to get home after that tragedy.
[03:16:52.246 --> 03:16:54.688]  Now I'm sure there were some that were offering free lifts.
[03:16:55.649 --> 03:17:03.514]  But Cosmopolitan took this, they put out a tweet, and if you go onto my Twitter page you can scroll down, it's on there, as of about an hour ago.
[03:17:03.854 --> 03:17:06.896]  They put out a tweet with a picture of a Sikh man
[03:17:07.950 --> 03:17:11.433]  Saying that he was a Muslim offering free lifts.
[03:17:11.513 --> 03:17:15.776]  Now, you could understand if they were just stupid and they're mistaking a Sikh for a Muslim.
[03:17:16.037 --> 03:17:19.139]  It's pretty easy to tell, based on the headgear.
[03:17:19.960 --> 03:17:30.008]  But they asked the originator of this photo for permission to use it, and in the original tweet that this Sikh guy posted, he said he was a Sikh.
[03:17:30.572 --> 03:17:34.015]  Cosmopolitan deliberately twisted that.
[03:17:34.275 --> 03:17:36.397]  They took it and claimed he was a Muslim.
[03:17:36.457 --> 03:17:41.802]  Again, because virtue signalling about Muslims and Islamophobia, that's the main concern.
[03:17:42.182 --> 03:17:52.711]  That's the numero umero thing that everybody has to do after an Islamic terrorist has slaughtered 22 people, 23 people, and maimed dozens more.
[03:17:53.091 --> 03:17:54.973]  That is the most important thing.
[03:17:56.198 --> 03:18:06.346]  Yeah, just imagine if some of these leftists got as irate about Islamic terrorism as they did, oh I don't know, people with opinions with which they don't agree.
[03:18:07.326 --> 03:18:16.693]  Remember Antifa, remember Berkeley, remember the absolute bedlam that takes place when anyone dares express an opinion that goes against their leftist consensus.
[03:18:17.053 --> 03:18:18.935]  They go absolutely ape.
[03:18:20.000 --> 03:18:21.501]  When something like this happens, no.
[03:18:21.781 --> 03:18:22.422]  We're bad.
[03:18:22.942 --> 03:18:24.723]  We're bad for talking about Islam.
[03:18:25.104 --> 03:18:26.244]  I'll give you another example.
[03:18:27.285 --> 03:18:41.595]  Somebody put out a tweet earlier which said, bearing in mind, as we talked about earlier, Katie Hopkins is literally under police investigation for a tweet which basically said we need men to stand up against Islamic terrorism.
[03:18:41.635 --> 03:18:43.016]  That's basically all that it said.
[03:18:44.437 --> 03:18:46.318]  She's under police investigation for that now.
[03:18:46.799 --> 03:18:48.460]  They're visiting mosques, okay?
[03:18:49.238 --> 03:18:58.824]  This bomber came from Wally Range in Manchester, which is an area that has an area of Manchester that has four mosques, Wally Range.
[03:19:00.639 --> 03:19:04.021]  Two girls that went to Syria to join ISIS also came out of that area.
[03:19:04.421 --> 03:19:07.162]  So are the police going to be putting surveillance on those mosques?
[03:19:07.482 --> 03:19:12.885]  Are they going to be going to those mosques and finding out if they played a role in radicalising this individual?
[03:19:13.405 --> 03:19:21.288]  Well, not today it seems like, because they're travelling round mosques, checking if the people in the mosques are being attacked, if they're safe.
[03:19:21.929 --> 03:19:24.109]  Now, no-one's advocating attacks on mosques.
[03:19:24.149 --> 03:19:24.910]  That's ridiculous.
[03:19:25.825 --> 03:19:26.486]  Just as bad.
[03:19:26.526 --> 03:19:28.768]  You don't fight extremism with extremism.
[03:19:29.168 --> 03:19:33.652]  But for their primary concern to be, quote, hate speech.
[03:19:33.672 --> 03:19:38.877]  And they've come out on Twitter, all these different police bodies, and said, we will not tolerate hate speech.
[03:19:38.937 --> 03:19:43.300]  That was their first primary concern immediately after this attack.
[03:19:43.641 --> 03:19:46.043]  It is every single time.
[03:19:46.798 --> 03:19:55.582]  Because these councils are controlled by leftists, the same kind of people who ignored the ritual abuse of children for years and years.
[03:19:55.982 --> 03:20:07.648]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:20:08.248 --> 03:20:10.329]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[03:20:10.509 --> 03:20:13.330]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:20:13.771 --> 03:20:15.071]  It's made in the USA.
[03:20:15.711 --> 03:20:24.095]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the InfoWars.
[03:20:24.455 --> 03:20:26.416]  It is a classical 360Win.
[03:20:26.896 --> 03:20:30.678]  Our formula at InfoWarsLife.com is quite frankly simple.
[03:20:31.378 --> 03:20:36.601]  We go out and look at the recognized research and we take it to the next level of quality,
[03:20:37.381 --> 03:20:39.823]  Of purity and of strength.
[03:20:40.784 --> 03:20:44.166]  Because this is what I personally use for myself and my family.
[03:20:44.586 --> 03:20:52.172]  We've gone through 5 or 6 different permutations in the last 4 years since we launched in 4 Wars Life to actually come up with this.
[03:20:52.972 --> 03:21:00.538]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection.
[03:21:01.118 --> 03:21:01.318]  I think?
[03:21:20.842 --> 03:21:30.684]  You owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world, that patriots stay as healthy, and as clean, and as focused as you can be.
[03:21:30.744 --> 03:21:39.006]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level, and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:21:39.206 --> 03:21:45.947]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the New World Order.
[03:21:46.954 --> 03:21:50.736]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[03:21:51.196 --> 03:21:55.579]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:21:56.039 --> 03:22:00.181]  This is the InfoWars Power Pack, and it can start your car if it has a dead battery.
[03:22:00.561 --> 03:22:03.523]  And we're going to show you this car won't even turn over.
[03:22:06.894 --> 03:22:09.575]  And now we're going to use the Power Pack to jumpstart this truck.
[03:22:10.175 --> 03:22:11.076]  It's very simple.
[03:22:11.256 --> 03:22:14.497]  All you do is pop up this tab right here and insert the connector.
[03:22:15.317 --> 03:22:19.919]  Connect the black clip to your negative terminal and the red clip to the positive terminal on your battery.
[03:22:20.660 --> 03:22:21.920]  Switch on the Power Pack.
[03:22:22.580 --> 03:22:25.401]  Wait a few minutes and then you'll be able to start your car.
[03:22:26.142 --> 03:22:31.304]  With just a few minutes on the Infowars Battery Pack, you go from a dead battery to this.
[03:22:37.921 --> 03:22:40.645]  You get all that cranking power in this little brick.
[03:22:43.871 --> 03:22:45.153]  And with that, you're on your way.
[03:22:46.536 --> 03:22:48.897]  This is the InfoWars Premium Power Pack.
[03:22:49.658 --> 03:22:54.961]  It's the perfect backup power device for camping, hunting, and any off-the-grid adventure.
[03:22:55.241 --> 03:22:59.964]  The InfoWars Power Pack comes in this sturdy storage case and includes the following accessories.
[03:23:00.224 --> 03:23:10.010]  The powerful 14,000 milliamp hour battery, jumper cables, USB cables for any device you might need, a car charger to charge on the go, and a wall charger.
[03:23:10.030 --> 03:23:13.612]  The Power Pack includes a handy flashlight with flashlight,
[03:23:14.492 --> 03:23:16.894]  SOS and a strobe function.
[03:23:18.034 --> 03:23:22.157]  With three high-powered USB ports, you can charge three devices simultaneously.
[03:23:22.857 --> 03:23:28.820]  The InfoWars PowerPak is a must-have, and it'll give you peace of mind whether you're at home or on the go.
[03:23:29.441 --> 03:23:34.844]  It's so compact, it'll fit in your backpack, your glove box, or even your back pocket.
[03:23:35.244 --> 03:23:38.486]  Get one for your home, boat, car, camping setup,
[03:23:38.866 --> 03:23:40.047]  Or just for emergencies.
[03:23:40.528 --> 03:23:47.135]  Secure your peace of mind today and order your Info Wars Power Pack from InfoWarsStore.com or dial 1-888-253-3139 and order today!
[03:24:12.067 --> 03:24:17.210]  So again, we have this narrative put out by the left after every single terrorist attack.
[03:24:17.530 --> 03:24:19.671]  Oh, but what about Islamophobia?
[03:24:19.711 --> 03:24:21.913]  What about people being mean to Muslims?
[03:24:21.973 --> 03:24:25.215]  That is the first thing they come out with every single time.
[03:24:25.495 --> 03:24:28.717]  They also come out with, oh, why are you blaming all Muslims?
[03:24:29.257 --> 03:24:31.079]  No one's blaming all Muslims!
[03:24:31.119 --> 03:24:34.501]  Why do they constantly insist that that's what we're saying?
[03:24:35.060 --> 03:24:36.161]  I've never said that.
[03:24:36.681 --> 03:24:40.284]  It's self-evident that that's not the case, statistically.
[03:24:40.544 --> 03:24:45.667]  But it's also self-evident, statistically, that many of these people have extreme beliefs.
[03:24:45.747 --> 03:24:46.768]  And it is a problem.
[03:24:47.168 --> 03:24:50.310]  Islam has a problem with violence, okay?
[03:24:50.350 --> 03:24:53.893]  When 32% say it's justifiable,
[03:24:54.713 --> 03:25:00.117]  To commit terrorist attacks if it's in revenge for insulting the Prophet.
[03:25:00.137 --> 03:25:02.198]  32% of British Muslims think that.
[03:25:02.558 --> 03:25:03.819]  That is a problem.
[03:25:04.119 --> 03:25:12.365]  When one in four British Muslims say the 7-7 attacks in London which killed 50-odd people are justifiable, that is a problem.
[03:25:12.605 --> 03:25:15.607]  That's something we need to have a national conversation about.
[03:25:16.187 --> 03:25:24.897]  Without leftists coming in immediately and saying you're a racist, you're an islamophobe, even though Islam is not a race, and that you're saying all Muslims are responsible.
[03:25:25.178 --> 03:25:26.319]  Nobody's saying that!
[03:25:27.034 --> 03:25:32.058]  Only complete idiots would claim that, so why do they try to create that straw man?
[03:25:32.358 --> 03:25:46.549]  Well, it's a deceptive tactic to shut down debate, because again, they cannot tolerate the fact that Islam is not a progressive belief system, yet they still have to embrace it anyway, because it's all about the oppression Olympics.
[03:25:47.510 --> 03:25:50.252]  Now, this is a tweet that was said about me about two hours ago.
[03:25:51.118 --> 03:25:58.047]  Just to give you another example of the sheer idiocy that absolutely dominates Twitter after every single one of these incidents.
[03:25:58.667 --> 03:26:04.374]  It says, quote, I'd just like to apologize to all peaceful Muslims on behalf of white people.
[03:26:04.755 --> 03:26:08.319]  Paul Joseph Watson and Katie Hopkins don't represent all of us.
[03:26:09.160 --> 03:26:09.661]  So again,
[03:26:10.427 --> 03:26:12.348]  Putting it into the context of race.
[03:26:12.649 --> 03:26:14.190]  Islam is not a race.
[03:26:14.250 --> 03:26:15.851]  I have to keep saying that over and over again.
[03:26:16.031 --> 03:26:19.694]  There are actually white Muslims, there are black Muslims, there are brown Muslims.
[03:26:19.714 --> 03:26:22.136]  That's because it's a frigging belief system.
[03:26:22.676 --> 03:26:23.877]  It's not a race.
[03:26:24.497 --> 03:26:27.199]  So again, they put it in the context of why are you blaming all Muslims?
[03:26:27.520 --> 03:26:30.882]  Show me one instance where I blamed all Muslims for anything.
[03:26:31.242 --> 03:26:35.345]  You can't because it's a dishonest tactic to shut down a debate.
[03:26:35.606 --> 03:26:37.027]  It's not a real argument.
[03:26:37.107 --> 03:26:38.728]  It's never been part of the debate.
[03:26:39.477 --> 03:26:51.728]  What should be part of the debate is the fact that massive numbers of Muslims throughout the West, you know, 42% of young Muslims in France support suicide bombing under certain circumstances.
[03:26:52.448 --> 03:26:53.309]  That's a problem.
[03:26:53.489 --> 03:26:58.214]  We have to face up to it to try and stop these massacres from happening over and over again.
[03:26:58.234 --> 03:26:59.715]  Because as you see with this individual,
[03:27:00.757 --> 03:27:03.700]  The guy, the suicide bomber behind the Manchester Arena attack.
[03:27:04.061 --> 03:27:06.143]  Born in Manchester.
[03:27:06.463 --> 03:27:08.826]  This is one of the integrated ones.
[03:27:09.427 --> 03:27:13.051]  His parents were Libyan refugees who came to the UK.
[03:27:13.291 --> 03:27:14.713]  The UK gave them refuge.
[03:27:15.053 --> 03:27:16.935]  They gave us a suicide bomber.
[03:27:17.235 --> 03:27:17.976]  Gee, thanks.
[03:27:18.417 --> 03:27:20.539]  What is happening in these communities?
[03:27:20.579 --> 03:27:22.141]  What is happening in these prisons?
[03:27:22.828 --> 03:27:29.073]  In these mosques where people are radicalised to such a degree that they will maim and mutilate teenage girls.
[03:27:29.393 --> 03:27:32.435]  That should be the main frigging focus.
[03:27:32.776 --> 03:27:35.117]  Not Katie Hopkins' offensive tweets.
[03:27:37.599 --> 03:27:40.201]  I mean, I've laid out this scenario before, I'll lay it out again.
[03:27:40.241 --> 03:27:41.722]  Let's see how much time we've got left here.
[03:27:42.543 --> 03:27:43.524]  And we're going to get into more news.
[03:27:43.544 --> 03:27:45.945]  We're going to get into the Libyan migrant crisis.
[03:27:45.965 --> 03:27:47.807]  We're going to get into Seth Rich after the break.
[03:27:49.008 --> 03:27:49.348]  But again,
[03:27:49.972 --> 03:27:50.753]  Here's a scenario.
[03:27:51.033 --> 03:27:54.575]  Say five Delta Airlines planes crashed in a single day.
[03:27:55.596 --> 03:27:58.278]  In one day, five Delta Airlines planes crash.
[03:27:58.558 --> 03:28:00.100]  What would the normal reaction be?
[03:28:00.540 --> 03:28:04.763]  Well, it would be to say, damn, there's something wrong with Delta planes.
[03:28:04.803 --> 03:28:06.164]  We need to investigate this.
[03:28:06.444 --> 03:28:07.765]  We need to get to the bottom of it.
[03:28:07.965 --> 03:28:11.948]  We need to do something about it, because this cannot keep happening.
[03:28:12.148 --> 03:28:12.989]  People are dying.
[03:28:13.449 --> 03:28:18.313]  That would be the normal reaction to five Delta Airlines planes crashing in a single day.
[03:28:19.085 --> 03:28:20.647]  What would be the insane reaction?
[03:28:21.167 --> 03:28:33.939]  Well, it would be to tweet, hashtag, not all Delta, and say that thousands of Delta Airlines planes didn't crash today, so why are you blaming all of Delta Airlines, you Deltaphobe?
[03:28:34.499 --> 03:28:36.221]  That would be the insane reaction.
[03:28:36.621 --> 03:28:40.825]  The insane reaction would be to say, well, only five Delta Airlines planes crashed
[03:28:41.385 --> 03:28:42.846]  Thousands of them didn't crash.
[03:28:43.306 --> 03:28:44.927]  It's just a few bad planes.
[03:28:45.467 --> 03:28:51.789]  Maybe we should just be tolerant of Delta Airlines planes crashing and continue life as normal.
[03:28:52.990 --> 03:28:55.210]  Okay, that would be the insane reaction.
[03:28:55.370 --> 03:28:56.871]  Nobody would have that reaction.
[03:28:57.091 --> 03:29:01.813]  But that's exactly the reaction the left has when it comes to terrorism.
[03:29:01.853 --> 03:29:09.896]  And it's again, because they've embodied many of the same goals as Islamic terrorists in terms of hating the West.
[03:29:10.879 --> 03:29:14.483]  I mean, Europe has now completely lost faith in its culture.
[03:29:14.763 --> 03:29:21.329]  The political class is flooding the continent with these people who have extreme regressive beliefs.
[03:29:21.849 --> 03:29:22.690]  Look what's happening.
[03:29:23.271 --> 03:29:25.713]  And it's not just an existential threat with the terrorism.
[03:29:25.793 --> 03:29:29.757]  It's the day-to-day grind, the harassment, the abuse, the rape gangs.
[03:29:29.797 --> 03:29:31.879]  This is what Europe is currently going through.
[03:29:31.899 --> 03:29:34.001]  And it's because of what
[03:29:34.998 --> 03:29:42.367]  Angela Merkel, because of what Macron stands for, because of what the political elite stands for, we cannot allow it to go on.
[03:29:42.387 --> 03:29:43.409]  We'll be back after the break.
[03:29:43.449 --> 03:29:44.690]  It's the Alex Jones Show Live.
[03:29:44.710 --> 03:29:45.411]  Don't go away.
[03:29:56.038 --> 03:30:03.804]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.
[03:30:04.024 --> 03:30:10.429]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds, even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[03:30:10.669 --> 03:30:18.956]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[03:30:19.236 --> 03:30:27.979]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[03:30:28.239 --> 03:30:33.981]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[03:30:34.321 --> 03:30:34.801]  It works.
[03:30:35.081 --> 03:30:43.384]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level Ballistic Resistance Certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[03:30:43.424 --> 03:30:52.946]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWareStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the InfoWare against the globalists all at the same time.
[03:30:53.307 --> 03:30:54.527]  A total 360 win.
[03:30:58.808 --> 03:31:00.189]  Let's go to Debit in Florida.
[03:31:00.229 --> 03:31:01.049]  Debit in Florida.
[03:31:01.069 --> 03:31:01.489]  You're on the air.
[03:31:02.458 --> 03:31:02.838]  Great!
[03:31:02.938 --> 03:31:03.919]  Hey, thank you so much.
[03:31:04.039 --> 03:31:08.422]  Listen, I have bought your products, and I gotta say, they're amazing.
[03:31:08.583 --> 03:31:17.689]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it, because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swell, Vitamin Interfusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[03:31:17.709 --> 03:31:18.650]  Wow, thank you.
[03:31:18.670 --> 03:31:21.012]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[03:31:21.072 --> 03:31:22.653]  Which Nutraceutical does you like best?
[03:31:22.893 --> 03:31:26.214]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[03:31:26.374 --> 03:31:27.414]  That's really incredible.
[03:31:27.634 --> 03:31:30.675]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[03:31:30.695 --> 03:31:32.015]  Like, I haven't felt this week.
[03:31:32.035 --> 03:31:33.636]  My morning was fantastic.
[03:31:33.716 --> 03:31:34.816]  And I love you guys.
[03:31:34.836 --> 03:31:36.396]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[03:31:37.117 --> 03:31:43.798]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[03:31:43.978 --> 03:31:44.758]  You will love it.

[03:31:45.499 --> 03:31:46.799]  I've never bought a bad product.

[03:33:06.101 --> 03:33:08.283]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:33:08.804 --> 03:33:13.809]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[03:33:23.228 --> 03:33:25.269]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:25.289 --> 03:33:28.291]  This is an article out of Breitbart.
[03:33:28.311 --> 03:33:32.434]  2017 has seen a terror attack attempted in Europe every nine days.
[03:33:32.974 --> 03:33:36.456]  We talked about for years how Europe would end up like Israel.
[03:33:36.637 --> 03:33:39.418]  It's now slowly beginning to seem like it.
[03:33:39.658 --> 03:33:42.220]  In fact, it seems like it's worse right now.
[03:33:42.620 --> 03:33:47.303]  Europe, the United Kingdom, Russia have witnessed terror attacks or attempted attacks every nine days in 2017.
[03:33:48.744 --> 03:33:58.451]  On average, analysis of security incidents has revealed since January around 45 people have been killed by mostly Islamic terrorists while hundreds have been injured.
[03:33:58.852 --> 03:34:04.816]  The only known incident not linked to jihadism was the attack on the Borussia Dortmund soccer team.
[03:34:05.517 --> 03:34:12.522]  Attacks and attempted attacks have taken place in Austria, France, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Italy, Russia, Sweden, Norway and Germany.
[03:34:13.220 --> 03:34:26.004]  Just in 2017 alone, security services in Britain, which has a population of 65 million, are known to be tracking 3,500 potential terror suspects or persons posing a threat.
[03:34:26.024 --> 03:34:32.166]  And again, in most cases, even though they're likely to become terrorists, they have to leave them alone.
[03:34:32.586 --> 03:34:33.506]  Thousands of them.
[03:34:34.326 --> 03:34:39.309]  Thousands more flocking back in as a result of these ISIS-controlled areas collapsing.
[03:34:39.729 --> 03:34:40.930]  They're coming back to Europe.
[03:34:41.210 --> 03:34:43.392]  They're being allowed back into the country.
[03:34:43.912 --> 03:34:45.293]  Refugees welcome.
[03:34:45.653 --> 03:34:47.874]  The red carpet is rolled out.
[03:34:48.735 --> 03:34:55.139]  Now let's move on to the refugee crisis, of course, because it emerged that the parents of this suicide bomber
[03:34:55.936 --> 03:34:59.598]  Escaped from the Gaddafi regime to come to the UK.
[03:35:00.138 --> 03:35:06.102]  Let's take a look at what's happening in Libya and why the true scale of it is being hidden from the public.
[03:35:06.702 --> 03:35:20.249]  Now this is important because as we know, Gaddafi warned before he was toppled that jihadists would flock across the Mediterranean, would infiltrate European countries, would carry out terrorist attacks.
[03:35:20.750 --> 03:35:23.331]  That's exactly what is happening.
[03:35:23.711 --> 03:35:24.612]  Why is it happening?
[03:35:25.282 --> 03:35:33.428]  Because of these NGOs, because of these EU boats, these vessels that are literally giving migrants a taxi service straight to Europe.
[03:35:34.208 --> 03:35:45.836]  This is the biggest risk conception surrounding the migrant crisis, that these quote refugees are struggling to get close to Europe and their NGO boats are rescuing them.
[03:35:46.136 --> 03:35:47.397]  They're not rescuing them.
[03:35:48.502 --> 03:35:49.502]  This is how it works.
[03:35:49.863 --> 03:35:58.687]  The migrants pay people smugglers in Libya up to 1,500 euros each, which is a year's wages, okay?
[03:35:58.987 --> 03:36:02.068]  So they're not destitute refugees.
[03:36:02.088 --> 03:36:06.430]  80% of them, in the case of the ones going to Italy, or 85% indeed, are men.
[03:36:07.390 --> 03:36:10.952]  They're not, forget Syria, they're not even from Libya.
[03:36:11.932 --> 03:36:14.393]  They're from other African countries.
[03:36:14.653 --> 03:36:16.473]  Eritrea, Nigeria.
[03:36:16.733 --> 03:36:18.253]  They're not refugees.
[03:36:18.493 --> 03:36:19.934]  They're economic migrants.
[03:36:20.194 --> 03:36:22.054]  They're paying people smugglers.
[03:36:23.594 --> 03:36:28.956]  The people smugglers transport them to a position just 12 miles off the coast of Libya.
[03:36:29.176 --> 03:36:30.436]  Just 12 miles.
[03:36:31.396 --> 03:36:36.817]  Then they send out a distress signal and these NGO vessels get the call.
[03:36:37.257 --> 03:36:38.798]  They come straight to them.
[03:36:38.898 --> 03:36:39.738]  They pick them up.
[03:36:40.118 --> 03:36:40.338]  Again,
[03:36:41.667 --> 03:36:46.051]  We presented the evidence, and it's going to be in a big video that I've got coming out in a couple of days.
[03:36:46.452 --> 03:36:50.996]  The people smugglers are in direct contact with the aid agencies.
[03:36:51.657 --> 03:37:02.448]  Even though it's completely illegal, they're in direct phone contact with them, which is why they're often first on the scene to rescue these migrants, which is a criminal offence.
[03:37:03.266 --> 03:37:09.733]  To be coordinating with criminal people smugglers, that's something that they should be prosecuted for.
[03:37:10.273 --> 03:37:19.122]  And they will be prosecuted if this investigation in Italy draws to its correct conclusion, because that's the way it's heading at the moment, thankfully.
[03:37:20.304 --> 03:37:22.606]  So we've played the videos before.
[03:37:22.646 --> 03:37:25.289]  You can go to marinetraffic.com and see.
[03:37:26.460 --> 03:37:35.707]  How these boats come from Sicily, they leave Sicily, they go to 12 miles off the coast of Libya, they pick up their human cargo, take it back to Italy.
[03:37:36.507 --> 03:37:38.188]  It's literally a taxi service.
[03:37:39.409 --> 03:37:45.794]  When these migrants get back to Italy, having been picked up, half of them immediately disappear.
[03:37:47.275 --> 03:37:48.035]  Half of them.
[03:37:48.656 --> 03:37:50.437]  Now you've seen the stats when it comes to
[03:37:51.431 --> 03:37:54.013]  Certain people from Islamic countries supporting ISIS.
[03:37:54.113 --> 03:37:54.813]  Huge numbers.
[03:37:55.113 --> 03:37:56.494]  Uncomfortably huge numbers.
[03:37:56.754 --> 03:37:59.055]  Half of those people are just disappearing.
[03:37:59.636 --> 03:38:00.716]  We've seen the reports.
[03:38:01.477 --> 03:38:02.858]  Migrants arriving in Italy.
[03:38:03.098 --> 03:38:04.158]  Eyewitness testimony.
[03:38:04.459 --> 03:38:08.381]  They have ISIS flags, beheading videos on their phone.
[03:38:09.561 --> 03:38:09.862]  Okay?
[03:38:09.882 --> 03:38:11.422]  Some of these people are jihadists.
[03:38:11.883 --> 03:38:13.664]  Some of them have been paid by ISIS
[03:38:14.716 --> 03:38:18.100]  To become ISIS members, to become ISIS sleeper cells in Europe.
[03:38:18.140 --> 03:38:24.066]  That's how many of them pay the 1,500 euro fee to the people smugglers in the first place.
[03:38:25.468 --> 03:38:31.254]  And isn't it ironic that the only time, the only time these boats are diverted from Sicily
[03:38:32.156 --> 03:38:37.098]  Having picked up migrants from Libya is when the G7 elitists are in town.
[03:38:37.418 --> 03:38:38.819]  We had that story last week.
[03:38:39.319 --> 03:38:48.764]  So the only time they don't head back to Italy is when the very political class that created this disaster is in town.
[03:38:49.344 --> 03:38:54.406]  They don't want to be faced up with the consequences of the policies they created.
[03:38:55.127 --> 03:38:58.068]  Because again, it's a security threat, security threat for them.
[03:38:58.877 --> 03:39:00.398]  Forget about the Italian people.
[03:39:00.758 --> 03:39:11.263]  There's literally a war on the streets of Italy in places like Palermo in Sicily between mafias, between Italian mafias and these African migrant gangs.
[03:39:11.723 --> 03:39:13.884]  They're literally shooting each other, killing each other.
[03:39:14.465 --> 03:39:17.986]  The mayor of Palermo, in fact, I can find his comment here.
[03:39:18.767 --> 03:39:27.511]  He actually said that Palermo was now a Middle Eastern Islamic town, and he was happy with that.
[03:39:28.351 --> 03:39:30.372]  No, a lot of them just love it.
[03:39:30.392 --> 03:39:35.695]  A lot of them just love being a turf war between migrant criminal gangs and the Italian mafia.
[03:39:36.255 --> 03:39:39.777]  That's what they want, that's what they're getting in places like Palermo.
[03:39:40.878 --> 03:39:44.059]  But again, the problem goes back to these NGO ships.
[03:39:45.140 --> 03:39:47.501]  Many of them are German, no surprise there.
[03:39:48.021 --> 03:39:55.725]  Even the EU border agency Frontex has accused aid agencies of helping criminals achieve their objectives.
[03:39:56.085 --> 03:39:57.186]  That's a direct quote.
[03:39:58.931 --> 03:40:06.196]  The people smugglers contact the NGO boats because they know they won't be arrested if they contacted Coast Guard boats.
[03:40:06.236 --> 03:40:08.597]  They've got a risk of being arrested, so they don't do that.
[03:40:10.058 --> 03:40:10.619]  Here's a quote.
[03:40:10.659 --> 03:40:23.607]  Since June 2016, many boats have been rescued near the Libyan coast by aid agency vessels without any prior distress call, suggesting the rendezvous has been pre-arranged.
[03:40:24.187 --> 03:40:28.170]  So again, they're in direct contact with the criminal people smugglers.
[03:40:28.910 --> 03:40:43.367]  Italian prosecutor Carmelo Zaccaro says he has evidence of phone calls between criminal people smugglers and NGOs like Save the Children, Proactiva Open Arms and SOS Mediterranean.
[03:40:45.035 --> 03:40:49.577]  Also, Avaz.org, MedicineSanFrontier and MoveOn.org are all involved.
[03:40:49.977 --> 03:40:54.659]  You'll notice those are all George Soros bankrolled organisations.
[03:40:54.679 --> 03:41:01.042]  500 million he invested not long ago to, quote, help refugees.
[03:41:01.643 --> 03:41:09.006]  And undoubtedly, much of it is going to these NGOs to chart these vessels that go out, bring these unvetted
[03:41:09.907 --> 03:41:15.351]  In some cases, ISIS members or ISIS sympathizers into Europe.
[03:41:16.712 --> 03:41:18.773]  So again, it's an absolutely huge scandal.
[03:41:19.094 --> 03:41:20.755]  Nobody knows the scale of it.
[03:41:20.935 --> 03:41:28.200]  We're talking 200,000 migrants have arrived in Italy last year alone, and that's increasing.
[03:41:28.220 --> 03:41:28.941]  200,000 a year.
[03:41:31.451 --> 03:41:36.295]  Unvetted, just brought straight in, half of them immediately disappear.
[03:41:36.755 --> 03:41:42.279]  Just 2.65% of migrants arriving in Italy are awarded asylum status.
[03:41:42.319 --> 03:41:46.442]  So again, the huge misconception that they're all refugees.
[03:41:46.722 --> 03:41:47.943]  They're not refugees.
[03:41:48.263 --> 03:41:56.069]  The vast majority of them are men and half of them at least just immediately disappear as soon as they arrive in Europe.
[03:41:58.180 --> 03:42:00.320]  Now, people say, well, is the migrant crisis going to end?
[03:42:00.340 --> 03:42:07.302]  Is there just going to be just so many people coming in that it stops being a deluge and just becomes a trickle?
[03:42:07.362 --> 03:42:07.782]  Well, no.
[03:42:08.922 --> 03:42:11.063]  Because Africa's population is exploding.
[03:42:11.103 --> 03:42:12.543]  Again, where are these people coming from?
[03:42:12.563 --> 03:42:14.023]  They're not Libyans, OK?
[03:42:14.043 --> 03:42:15.144]  They're coming from Niger.
[03:42:15.384 --> 03:42:16.384]  They're coming from Chad.
[03:42:16.424 --> 03:42:17.444]  They're coming from Sudan.
[03:42:17.704 --> 03:42:19.544]  They're coming from Ethiopia.
[03:42:20.125 --> 03:42:26.686]  You look at the projected populations of those countries in Africa, Africa's population is exploding.
[03:42:27.737 --> 03:42:29.258]  These are the countries surrounding Libya.
[03:42:29.779 --> 03:42:33.962]  Niger's population is set to quadruple in the next three decades.
[03:42:34.562 --> 03:42:36.524]  20 million to 72 million.
[03:42:36.864 --> 03:42:41.387]  Chad's population is going to leap from 14 million to 35 million.
[03:42:42.048 --> 03:42:43.969]  Sudan is heading towards 80 million.
[03:42:43.989 --> 03:42:44.510]  Egypt, 152 million.
[03:42:44.690 --> 03:42:45.310]  Ethiopia, 189 million.
[03:42:45.330 --> 03:42:46.231]  And Nigeria, 400 million.
[03:42:46.251 --> 03:42:47.472]  So it's never gonna stop.
[03:42:56.070 --> 03:43:03.355]  If we have this policy of just picking them up, bringing them in on taxis, it's never going to stop.
[03:43:04.256 --> 03:43:05.116]  And this is the problem.
[03:43:05.276 --> 03:43:13.101]  You can't flood European cities with tens of millions of people from the Middle East and Africa and expect it to remain the same.
[03:43:13.382 --> 03:43:18.745]  Eventually, it's going to start to feel less like Europe and more like the Middle East and Africa.
[03:43:18.765 --> 03:43:19.686]  OK?
[03:43:20.549 --> 03:43:26.512]  If you took hundreds of millions of white people and dumped them into China, that's going to change their society.
[03:43:27.152 --> 03:43:30.234]  It's just basic demographics, basic culture.
[03:43:31.955 --> 03:43:34.616]  So again, Southern Italy is going through absolute nightmares.
[03:43:34.636 --> 03:43:39.499]  They're having turf wars between the Italian Mafia and these African crime gangs that have arrived.
[03:43:40.719 --> 03:43:44.101]  This is the quote from the Mayor of Palermo that I alluded to earlier.
[03:43:44.818 --> 03:43:47.700]  He said, quote, Palermo is no longer an Italian town.
[03:43:47.820 --> 03:43:49.340]  It's no longer European.
[03:43:49.641 --> 03:43:53.423]  You can walk in the city and feel like you're in Istanbul or Beirut.
[03:43:53.823 --> 03:43:56.524]  Palermo is a Middle Eastern town in Europe.
[03:43:58.145 --> 03:43:59.706]  That's the mayor of Palermo.
[03:44:00.486 --> 03:44:01.707]  He's happy about it.
[03:44:01.987 --> 03:44:03.308]  He said it was a good thing.
[03:44:04.248 --> 03:44:07.590]  Similar to how the Green Party member in Germany said that, you know,
[03:44:08.797 --> 03:44:13.160]  Major German cities being a white minority in 20 years would be a great thing.
[03:44:13.301 --> 03:44:14.221]  They celebrated it.
[03:44:14.401 --> 03:44:15.482]  This is what they're all about.
[03:44:16.983 --> 03:44:21.427]  Because again, they ship in a class of people that are totally dependent on handouts.
[03:44:21.787 --> 03:44:23.028]  That keeps them in power.
[03:44:23.268 --> 03:44:24.809]  That's all they care about.
[03:44:25.170 --> 03:44:26.771]  They want to be in power forever.
[03:44:27.031 --> 03:44:28.532]  This is how they think they're going to do it.
[03:44:28.752 --> 03:44:31.054]  By destroying their own culture.
[03:44:31.595 --> 03:44:33.596]  By committing suicide.
[03:44:34.697 --> 03:44:35.838]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:44:37.159 --> 03:44:38.600]  And it's not just the terror attacks.
[03:44:39.341 --> 03:44:42.843]  People make the argument, well, you know, how many people die of cancer?
[03:44:42.883 --> 03:44:44.624]  How many people die in road accidents?
[03:44:45.084 --> 03:44:47.026]  It's not just the existential threat.
[03:44:48.306 --> 03:44:50.848]  There was a report out of Sweden the other day which we covered.
[03:44:52.309 --> 03:44:56.292]  90% of shootings in Sweden using firearms are carried out by migrants.
[03:44:58.193 --> 03:44:56.292]  90%.
[03:44:58.413 --> 03:44:59.274]  Not 19, 90.
[03:45:00.795 --> 03:45:01.835]  You can look at Germany.
[03:45:02.476 --> 03:45:05.978]  Their own government interior ministry report found that
[03:45:06.601 --> 03:45:16.793]  There were an extra 402,000 crimes committed by migrants per year, with non-Germans accounting for 27.6% of total offences.
[03:45:18.034 --> 03:45:21.178]  So they're completely over-represented in the crime statistics.
[03:45:22.139 --> 03:45:24.822]  You talk about that in Sweden, they put you on a hate list.
[03:45:25.062 --> 03:45:26.384]  You see how this begins to work?
[03:45:28.087 --> 03:45:30.868]  Half a million migrants in Germany are on welfare benefits.
[03:45:30.888 --> 03:45:39.391]  The idea that we need them to save our economy, to import workers because we're committing demographic suicide doesn't stand up.
[03:45:40.471 --> 03:45:41.692]  Most of them are on benefits.
[03:45:41.712 --> 03:45:42.532]  They don't have jobs.
[03:45:43.032 --> 03:45:44.133]  They bleed the economy.
[03:45:44.153 --> 03:45:45.413]  They don't add to the economy.
[03:45:47.034 --> 03:45:48.014]  We have the gang rapes.
[03:45:48.074 --> 03:45:49.034]  We have the harassment.
[03:45:49.054 --> 03:45:50.535]  We have the abuse of women.
[03:45:50.555 --> 03:45:53.816]  You now have women in Paris protesting
[03:45:54.711 --> 03:46:03.815]  Eastern Paris, because they can't leave the house dressed in certain clothing without being abused and harassed by gangs of migrant men.
[03:46:04.335 --> 03:46:05.335]  We've seen the rapes.
[03:46:05.555 --> 03:46:06.596]  We've seen the gang rapes.
[03:46:06.636 --> 03:46:10.117]  We had a gang rape in Austria reported just a few days ago.
[03:46:11.558 --> 03:46:20.601]  Weekly, at least bi-weekly, we have a gang rape in some small, quaint European town because of this culture that we've imported.
[03:46:22.942 --> 03:46:24.183]  In Germany and Italy, they're
[03:46:25.074 --> 03:46:28.976]  Confiscating private property to house these migrants in Sweden.
[03:46:29.236 --> 03:46:35.760]  The big postal company PostNord announced it would stop mail delivery to the migrant suburb of Rinkeby because it's too unsafe.
[03:46:37.360 --> 03:46:38.281]  Social media.
[03:46:38.541 --> 03:46:41.222]  Again, if you complain about this though, you're bad.
[03:46:42.503 --> 03:46:45.745]  Don't fix the problem, complain about the people who are complaining about it.
[03:46:46.025 --> 03:46:47.926]  Put them on a hate crime blacklist.
[03:46:48.877 --> 03:46:52.558]  That's what Angela Merkel's main concern was, wasn't it, when she talked to Zuckerberg?
[03:46:52.858 --> 03:46:55.979]  How can we stop people criticising this policy?
[03:46:57.380 --> 03:47:03.041]  So again, these NGOs that are picking up, it's a virtual taxi service.
[03:47:03.061 --> 03:47:07.263]  They're picking them up from the coast of Libya, dumping them into Italy, half go missing.
[03:47:07.823 --> 03:47:09.143]  We need to put a stop to this.
[03:47:09.783 --> 03:47:12.124]  These NGOs need to be prosecuted.
[03:47:12.364 --> 03:47:17.926]  They are currently being investigated by Italian authorities, and hopefully that prosecution
[03:47:18.914 --> 03:47:19.615]  We'll come through.
[03:47:20.575 --> 03:47:36.586]  The other positive development in actually stopping this is that Beppe Grillo's Five Star Movement, which is a populist party in Italy, according to recent polls is either tied or has a slender lead over the ruling centre-left party in Italy.
[03:47:36.606 --> 03:47:38.908]  And again, this is not just about Italy.
[03:47:39.428 --> 03:47:41.970]  This is where the migrants are coming in.
[03:47:42.270 --> 03:47:43.751]  This is the major route now.
[03:47:44.998 --> 03:47:49.320]  If we stop this, if we plug this leak, we can actually prevent terror attacks.
[03:47:49.820 --> 03:47:54.322]  ISIS has bragged about how they're exploiting this to infiltrate fighters into Europe.
[03:47:54.922 --> 03:48:04.086]  Support Beppe Grillo's Five Star Movement in Italy like nothing before because they have a chance of being elected next year in the Italian election.
[03:48:04.386 --> 03:48:10.589]  They have promised to stop these NGO boats picking up these migrants, dumping them into Italy.
[03:48:11.249 --> 03:48:12.630]  That's one of their campaigns.
[03:48:13.556 --> 03:48:15.297]  Beppe Grillo's Five Star Movement.
[03:48:15.357 --> 03:48:17.199]  Again, it's not a far-right party.
[03:48:17.519 --> 03:48:18.800]  It's a populist party.
[03:48:19.120 --> 03:48:20.921]  It's doing extremely well in the polls.
[03:48:21.802 --> 03:48:24.364]  And they have a chance of stopping this.
[03:48:25.945 --> 03:48:29.487]  Of stopping this nightmare that is being inflicted upon Europe.
[03:48:30.208 --> 03:48:33.030]  Another expression of which we saw last night in Manchester.
[03:48:33.630 --> 03:48:35.271]  But again, it's not just about migrants.
[03:48:35.331 --> 03:48:36.692]  It's not just about refugees.
[03:48:36.732 --> 03:48:38.433]  It's about these ghettoised areas.
[03:48:39.634 --> 03:48:40.735]  People going to mosques.
[03:48:40.855 --> 03:48:41.936]  People going to prisons.
[03:48:42.552 --> 03:48:46.553]  The radicalization problem in prisons is absolutely endemic.
[03:48:49.133 --> 03:48:52.234]  But again, because of political correctness, there's nothing done about it.
[03:48:52.354 --> 03:48:55.155]  There's absolutely nothing done about it at every turn.
[03:48:55.555 --> 03:48:57.615]  These are the solutions that we need to focus on.
[03:48:57.915 --> 03:49:01.236]  I mentioned some of them in my video, which you heard earlier.
[03:49:01.576 --> 03:49:01.876]  Okay?
[03:49:02.236 --> 03:49:06.017]  So, none of the debate is about all Muslims are responsible.
[03:49:06.557 --> 03:49:08.457]  The debate is this is terrible.
[03:49:08.758 --> 03:49:13.198]  We cannot let this become the new normal like the media wants us to do.
[03:49:13.519 --> 03:49:14.719]  We have to address this.
[03:49:15.059 --> 03:49:19.580]  We have to propose concrete solutions to prevent this from happening.
[03:49:20.380 --> 03:49:23.901]  Every nine days now in Europe there's a terror attack.
[03:49:25.841 --> 03:49:30.002]  So the solution is not to shut down people who are actually proposing
[03:49:31.104 --> 03:49:31.604]  Remedies.
[03:49:31.924 --> 03:49:38.386]  That's not the solution, but that's what this political class is pushing, because again, they're beholden to this policy.
[03:49:38.846 --> 03:49:44.128]  They created it for their own political machinations, now they're wedded to it.
[03:49:44.828 --> 03:49:55.511]  So they have to demonise anybody who tries to stop that policy, as Islamophobic, as racist, but we should not allow this to continue as normal.
[03:49:57.290 --> 03:49:58.170]  Another report here.
[03:49:58.310 --> 03:50:00.491]  ISIS claims responsibility for Manchester attack.
[03:50:00.531 --> 03:50:02.292]  Suspect bomber identified again.
[03:50:03.133 --> 03:50:04.853]  His parents were Libyan refugees.
[03:50:04.893 --> 03:50:06.334]  The UK gave them sanctuary.
[03:50:06.594 --> 03:50:08.135]  They gave us a suicide bomber.
[03:50:08.255 --> 03:50:08.855]  Gee, thanks.
[03:50:08.975 --> 03:50:10.936]  What is happening in these communities?
[03:50:11.796 --> 03:50:20.440]  They've carried out controlled explosions in Wally Range, an area of Manchester which again has four mosques in one area alone.
[03:50:21.980 --> 03:50:23.061]  It's not that big an area.
[03:50:23.321 --> 03:50:24.162]  Four mosques.
[03:50:24.242 --> 03:50:25.983]  What's happening inside these mosques?
[03:50:26.083 --> 03:50:27.304]  Did he attend the mosques?
[03:50:27.584 --> 03:50:28.685]  Was he radicalised?
[03:50:29.025 --> 03:50:34.669]  We know that he was known to security services, and that's the case in almost every single case.
[03:50:35.370 --> 03:50:40.033]  Because they're told, oh, you can only track them, you can't actually apprehend them, even though
[03:50:40.635 --> 03:50:41.536]  They're radicalised.
[03:50:41.816 --> 03:50:42.577]  They're terrorists.
[03:50:42.837 --> 03:50:44.819]  They're likely to commit terrorist attacks.
[03:50:44.859 --> 03:50:46.340]  This is the situation in Europe.
[03:50:46.641 --> 03:50:47.962]  It's absolutely horrific.
[03:50:48.302 --> 03:50:52.646]  Something must change beyond virtue signalling and hashtags.
[03:50:52.686 --> 03:50:54.308]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show Live.
[03:50:54.328 --> 03:50:54.848]  Don't go away.
[03:50:56.249 --> 03:51:01.753]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com, and this is an email from Family Gino.
[03:51:01.954 --> 03:51:08.439]  I took down my rebel flag, which you can't buy on eBay anymore, and peeled the NRA sticker off my rear car window.
[03:51:08.619 --> 03:51:13.062]  I disconnected my home alarm system and quit the candy-ass neighborhood watch.
[03:51:13.303 --> 03:51:17.366]  I bought two Pakistani flags and put one at each corner of the front yard.
[03:51:17.486 --> 03:51:22.650]  Then I purchased the black flag of ISIS, which you can buy on eBay, and ran it up the flagpole.
[03:51:22.810 --> 03:51:23.771]  Now the local police
[03:51:23.991 --> 03:51:29.995]  Sheriff, FBI, CIA, NSA, Homeland Security, and other agencies are all watching my house 24-7.
[03:51:30.875 --> 03:51:36.579]  I've never felt safer, and I'm saving $69.95 a month that ADT used to charge me.
[03:51:36.739 --> 03:51:40.241]  Plus, I bought burkas for my wife and I to wear when we shop or travel.
[03:51:40.381 --> 03:51:43.123]  Everyone moves out of the way, and security can't pat us down?
[03:51:43.283 --> 03:51:46.985]  If they say I'm a male wearing a burka, I just say, I'm feeling like a woman today.
[03:51:47.145 --> 03:51:47.725]  Hot damn!
[03:51:47.885 --> 03:51:48.626]  Safe at last!
[03:51:48.826 --> 03:51:49.767]  Ain't America great?
[03:51:50.447 --> 03:51:53.229]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[03:51:53.409 --> 03:51:54.389]  This is Joe Biggs.
[03:51:56.871 --> 03:52:02.194]  The reason InfoWars Live has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want products I'm gonna use for my family.
[03:52:02.354 --> 03:52:02.954]  I take this.
[03:52:03.194 --> 03:52:04.235]  My family takes this.
[03:52:04.315 --> 03:52:08.557]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're gonna find anywhere.
[03:52:08.617 --> 03:52:12.820]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:52:13.220 --> 03:52:17.783]  If I ever forget to take them, I have a noticeable difference.
[03:52:17.843 --> 03:52:18.903]  I don't feel good.
[03:52:18.983 --> 03:52:22.485]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[03:52:22.745 --> 03:52:25.387]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[03:52:25.427 --> 03:52:30.750]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[03:52:31.230 --> 03:52:33.651]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[03:52:34.192 --> 03:52:37.633]  And I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[03:52:37.734 --> 03:52:39.915]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[03:52:39.955 --> 03:52:40.315]  I love it.
[03:52:40.475 --> 03:52:43.076]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[03:52:43.276 --> 03:52:44.257]  Survival Shield X2.
[03:52:44.297 --> 03:52:49.919]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[03:52:49.939 --> 03:52:51.860]  It's got a five-star rating.
[03:52:52.120 --> 03:52:54.141]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[03:52:56.081 --> 03:53:00.286]  Men, give your body the support it needs with InfoWars Life Prostagard.

[03:54:14.007 --> 03:54:16.348]  It's the final segment of the Alex Jones Show fourth hour.
[03:54:16.548 --> 03:54:28.610]  I want to direct you to the specials at infowarsstore.com because again, very few outlets will actually have the temerity to tell you the truth about the aftermath of situations like Manchester.
[03:54:29.131 --> 03:54:36.732]  You know the sheer hate and oppression that is inflicted upon us simply for telling the truth about this.
[03:54:36.752 --> 03:54:39.993]  There are powerful forces that don't want you to hear this information.
[03:54:40.658 --> 03:54:44.020]  We've been so effective in red-pilling a generation.
[03:54:44.280 --> 03:54:47.601]  They're terrified of us and we couldn't do it without you.
[03:54:48.441 --> 03:54:53.444]  We need your support because we're constantly on the edge of being censored.
[03:54:53.484 --> 03:54:55.425]  We have to fight it day by day.
[03:54:56.105 --> 03:54:58.986]  Eventually they could just kick us off all these different platforms.
[03:54:59.046 --> 03:55:03.248]  We would be solely relying on you as we have been from the beginning.
[03:55:03.588 --> 03:55:05.429]  So please support us by getting the specials.
[03:55:05.469 --> 03:55:07.710]  We have the Support Patriot Media Special

[03:56:23.822 --> 03:56:25.042]  Now let's just finish off here.
[03:56:25.183 --> 03:56:27.044]  Moving on to Seth Rich News, of course.
[03:56:28.180 --> 03:56:36.067]  Last week we had a private investigator come out and claim that from his sources he knew that Seth Rich was the source of the DNC leaks.
[03:56:36.187 --> 03:56:37.348]  That got poo-pooed.
[03:56:37.429 --> 03:56:39.050]  There was a pushback against that.
[03:56:39.671 --> 03:56:40.531]  Was he threatened?
[03:56:40.571 --> 03:56:41.032]  We don't know.
[03:56:41.092 --> 03:56:48.759]  Now Kim Dotcom, who of course was the founder of Mega Upload, teased this yesterday by coming out and saying that he knew for a fact.
[03:56:49.423 --> 03:56:56.846]  That Seth Rich, not Russia, Seth Rich, the murdered DNC staffer, was the source of the DNC leak.
[03:56:56.886 --> 03:57:07.751]  Now he's released a statement on his website saying, quote, I know this because in late 2014 a person contacted me about helping me to start a branch of the Internet Party in the United States.
[03:57:07.791 --> 03:57:08.951]  He called himself Panda.
[03:57:09.612 --> 03:57:12.433]  I now know that Panda was Seth Rich.
[03:57:12.973 --> 03:57:17.135]  Of course, that's the icon, that's the avatar that he used on his different accounts.
[03:57:17.811 --> 03:57:18.372]  He continues.
[03:57:18.432 --> 03:57:19.253]  Panda advisement.
[03:57:19.293 --> 03:57:23.899]  He was working on voter analytics tools and other technologies that the Internet Party may find helpful.
[03:57:25.360 --> 03:57:29.786]  So he was disenfranchised because Bernie Sanders, who he supported, was screwed over.
[03:57:30.387 --> 03:57:31.989]  That was his motivation.
[03:57:32.069 --> 03:57:34.311]  He was in contact with Kim Dotcom.
[03:57:34.992 --> 03:57:37.135]  Now, Kim Dotcom continues in this statement.
[03:57:37.822 --> 03:57:39.043]  I've consulted with my lawyers.
[03:57:39.063 --> 03:57:42.125]  I accept my full statement should be provided to the authorities.
[03:57:42.165 --> 03:57:43.726]  So he says he's prepared to do that.
[03:57:44.286 --> 03:57:48.269]  If my evidence is required to be given in the US, I would be prepared to do so.
[03:57:48.769 --> 03:57:54.433]  If appropriate arrangements are made, I would need a guarantee from Special Counsel Mueller on behalf of the United States.
[03:57:54.513 --> 03:58:00.517]  Safe passage, given that his house has been raided before from New Zealand to the United States and back.
[03:58:00.537 --> 03:58:07.382]  So now he's saying he will give that evidence of Seth Rich being the source of the DNC leaks to a special prosecution.
[03:58:08.510 --> 03:58:11.092]  Will it come out or will they clamp down on it?
[03:58:11.132 --> 03:58:16.656]  They are absolutely terrified in DC, the establishment swamp of this coming out.
[03:58:16.936 --> 03:58:25.181]  Will it finally come to light, proving that Seth Rich was the source of the DNC leaks, derailing the whole Trump-Russia narrative?
[03:58:26.062 --> 03:58:29.284]  That's going to wrap it up for this segment of the Alex Jones Show Nightly News.
[03:58:29.344 --> 03:58:31.345]  Coming up, breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:37.355 --> 03:58:45.963]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:58:46.003 --> 03:58:51.528]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com, and this is an email from Family Gino.
[03:58:51.728 --> 03:58:58.194]  I took down my Rebel flag, which you can't buy on eBay anymore, and peeled the NRA sticker off my rear car window.
[03:58:58.394 --> 03:59:02.798]  I disconnected my home alarm system and quit the candy-ass neighborhood watch.
[03:59:03.018 --> 03:59:07.100]  I bought two Pakistani flags and put one at each corner of the front yard.
[03:59:07.220 --> 03:59:12.403]  Then I purchased the black flag of ISIS, which you can buy on eBay, and ran it up the flagpole.
[03:59:12.563 --> 03:59:19.407]  Now the local police, sheriff, FBI, CIA, NSA, Homeland Security, and other agencies are all watching my house 24-7.
[03:59:20.627 --> 03:59:26.333]  I've never felt safer, and I'm saving $69.95 a month that ADT used to charge me.
[03:59:26.493 --> 03:59:30.017]  Plus, I bought burkas for my wife and I to wear when we shop or travel.
[03:59:30.137 --> 03:59:32.859]  Everyone moves out of the way and security can't pat us down?
[03:59:33.040 --> 03:59:36.743]  If they say I'm a male wearing a burka, I just say, I'm feeling like a woman today.
[03:59:36.904 --> 03:59:37.484]  Hot damn!
[03:59:37.644 --> 03:59:38.385]  Safe at last!
[03:59:38.585 --> 03:59:39.586]  Ain't America great?
[03:59:40.207 --> 03:59:43.010]  You can find more reports like this at InfoWars.com.
[03:59:43.190 --> 03:59:44.131]  This is Joe Biggs.
[03:59:46.727 --> 03:59:50.821]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:59:51.363 --> 03:59:52.668]  It's Alex Jones!
