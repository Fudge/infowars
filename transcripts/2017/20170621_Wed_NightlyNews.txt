[00:00:18.706 --> 00:00:21.050]  Welcome to the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.115]  Today is Wednesday, June 21st, 2017.
[00:00:25.556 --> 00:00:28.600]  I'm Millie Weaver and here's what's coming up on the news tonight.
[00:00:33.755 --> 00:00:41.420]  Liberal tears flow freely as the implosion of the Democrat Party intensifies.
[00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:49.685]  And some of the most vocal anti-Trump celebrities are once again on the wrong side of history.
[00:00:50.025 --> 00:01:02.653]  Meanwhile, the leftist Day of Rage turns into a day of epic failure, as only a handful of protesters who vowed to overthrow the government
[00:01:03.553 --> 00:01:06.075]  Go home disappointed and empty-handed.
[00:01:06.715 --> 00:01:12.039]  All that plus a look at the latest terrorist incidents in Flint, Michigan.
[00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:20.345]  And one suspect is in custody after a law enforcement officer was stabbed in the neck at the airport in Flint, Michigan.
[00:01:20.385 --> 00:01:23.727]  That's coming up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:33.936]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:01:34.056 --> 00:01:36.317]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:01:36.497 --> 00:01:44.881]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:48.462]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:01:48.623 --> 00:01:56.666]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic
[00:01:56.986 --> 00:02:06.533]  Super Male Vitality Formula sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:02:06.754 --> 00:02:08.655]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:16.541]  Super Male Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:02:16.921 --> 00:02:23.103]  Supermail Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.

[00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.654]  I'm Millie Weaver and I'm going to be taking you guys through the news tonight.
[00:03:16.055 --> 00:03:25.805]  Well, first I want to talk about how apparently the leftist's planned day of rage ended up being an epic failure.
[00:03:25.885 --> 00:03:29.930]  It was a day of epic failure, of epic proportions.
[00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:37.214]  Apparently, a pathetic amount of protesters showed up outside of the London Parliament building.
[00:03:37.635 --> 00:03:46.240]  Now, these demonstrators were angry about the usual, the communist demands for housing, saying housing is a right.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:54.325]  Well, I guess you must think that housing is a right if you're still living in your parents' basement, refusing to get a job.
[00:03:54.746 --> 00:03:55.526]  Which is nice and all.
[00:03:55.546 --> 00:03:59.689]  I mean, it would be nice to just sit down and play video games all day, but
[00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:09.415]  You know, this is the real world, and as soon as these college kids realize that, hopefully they will get out and get a job, and thankfully, President Trump is working on that.
[00:04:09.475 --> 00:04:23.684]  Now, these people are living in London, but people were even, witnesses were even speaking about how they've seen more people, more kids, show up to a school field trip outside of the London Parliament than what they had seen.
[00:04:24.785 --> 00:04:25.845]  Well, apparently,
[00:04:27.248 --> 00:04:35.234]  Feds are looking into the Flint Airport stabbing as a possible act of terrorism.
[00:04:35.714 --> 00:04:47.603]  Now, this stabbing had occurred and it's no surprise that now we have the feds looking in to whether or not it could be an act of terrorism.
[00:04:47.663 --> 00:04:50.185]  Why, you know, why is there this hesitancy?
[00:04:50.605 --> 00:04:53.327]  Well, apparently this Canadian-born suspect
[00:04:53.707 --> 00:04:58.648]  Shouted Allahu Akbar and stabbed a man in the neck.
[00:04:59.028 --> 00:05:01.289]  Now, this wasn't just a normal man.
[00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:04.129]  This was a police officer.
[00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:06.210]  He was an airport police officer.
[00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:11.751]  And this happened at the Bishop International Airport in Flint, Michigan.
[00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:15.592]  Now, the officer is said to be in critical condition.
[00:05:15.612 --> 00:05:16.632]  I can imagine.
[00:05:17.512 --> 00:05:22.215]  I mean, if anyone was stabbed in the throat, you would have to be seriously, seriously injured.
[00:05:22.556 --> 00:05:24.557]  He's lucky to be even alive right now.
[00:05:25.098 --> 00:05:34.024]  His name is Lieutenant Jeff Neville, and apparently after this happened, they evacuated the airport and closed it for the day.
[00:05:34.324 --> 00:05:35.965]  Now, it's interesting here that
[00:05:36.966 --> 00:05:40.791]  They're still looking into whether or not this could be an act of terrorism.
[00:05:40.851 --> 00:05:47.820]  Well, if the guy's shouting, Allahu Akbar, it really doesn't take that long to put the two together and figure it out.
[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.767]  But, of course, if it had any inkling that it could be linked to
[00:05:54.468 --> 00:05:56.669]  The right to the alt-right.
[00:05:56.769 --> 00:05:58.970]  Well, they would be jumping all on it.
[00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:14.915]  Now, another story that's coming out right now is that the State Department has reopened a formal inquiry into the possible mishandling of classified information by former Secretary
[00:06:15.715 --> 00:06:18.137]  Of state, Hillary Clinton.
[00:06:18.537 --> 00:06:20.778]  Now, this is absolutely shocking to me.
[00:06:20.878 --> 00:06:40.330]  I mean, I'm glad they're opening up this investigation into Hillary again, because we do know that she's corrupt as it gets, and we know there's going to be something there, and with somebody other than Comey, who we now know was extremely corrupt, we could actually see a fair investigation in this, possibly.
[00:06:40.871 --> 00:06:42.272]  But what's surprising here
[00:06:43.212 --> 00:06:49.415]  Is that Hillary Clinton and her staffers apparently still have security clearances.
[00:06:50.116 --> 00:06:50.436]  Wow.
[00:06:50.576 --> 00:07:01.482]  What does that say about our country and about our national security if her and her staffers still have security clearances after all of what we've seen happen?
[00:07:01.502 --> 00:07:05.244]  I mean, it's not like she's denying the 33,000 emails.
[00:07:05.324 --> 00:07:06.525]  It's common knowledge.
[00:07:06.545 --> 00:07:12.388]  We've all come to the understanding that she was using a private email server and mishandling
[00:07:12.828 --> 00:07:22.972]  Classified information, but apparently they need to have a formal inquiry and reinvestigate that, so we will be keeping you guys updated as new updates come on that.
[00:07:23.453 --> 00:07:37.979]  Well, another story that's pretty funny here is that the campaign between John Ossoff, the Democratic hopeful candidate in Georgia, who is facing off with Karen Handel, well,
[00:07:38.539 --> 00:07:50.606]  A flood of liberal tears came in Georgia and fell down on Georgia after their Democratic hopeful candidate lost to Karen Handel.
[00:07:51.106 --> 00:07:59.151]  Now the liberals were seen crying and reliving their experience after Hillary Clinton had lost the presidency.
[00:07:59.191 --> 00:08:04.154]  They thought that they were going to get this Democrat in and it turned out to be
[00:08:05.194 --> 00:08:06.014]  Not the case.
[00:08:06.074 --> 00:08:17.177]  Now, this candidate, John Ossoff, was apparently very vocal about his disdain and about his anti-Trump support.
[00:08:17.217 --> 00:08:20.198]  I mean, he was a huge person that spoke out against President Trump.
[00:08:20.598 --> 00:08:24.279]  Now, let's get more into who this guy was.
[00:08:24.539 --> 00:08:30.060]  Well, he's a young guy and apparently he's backed by Nancy Pelosi.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:35.943]  Now that's interesting right there, so that can't be a good sign if he's backed by Nancy Pelosi.
[00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:40.767]  He's also another big advocate for Planned Parenthood.
[00:08:41.287 --> 00:08:50.393]  So he's fully out there supporting Planned Parenthood, who was caught up in that scandal with selling baby parts, and that can't be very good.
[00:08:51.093 --> 00:08:55.714]  And he, you know, he just has been speaking out that he was really against Trump.
[00:08:56.014 --> 00:09:00.355]  Now, on the other hand, let's talk a little bit about Karen Handel.
[00:09:00.775 --> 00:09:19.360]  Apparently, Karen Handel, she herself is a Trump supporter, and she wanted to fight to lower taxes, to protect the border with better border security, many of the things that Trump's talked about, improve the health care in America, bring back jobs, etc, etc.
[00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:35.631]  Now, what's interesting here is that apparently this guy, Jon Ossoff, who's backed by Nancy Pelosi and had tons of lobbyists funding his campaign, apparently he outspent
[00:09:36.912 --> 00:09:40.395]  Handel, 7-1 on his campaign.
[00:09:40.435 --> 00:09:49.143]  Apparently he spent $22 million to her $3 million and he still lost.
[00:09:49.584 --> 00:09:53.447]  That is why so many Democrats were crying.
[00:09:53.828 --> 00:09:59.593]  They're like, we put so many of our eggs in this basket and we still got our butts handed to us.
[00:09:59.793 --> 00:10:01.354]  Oh my gosh, what is going on?
[00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:05.115]  Is everybody in the world just a bunch of racist Nazis and Hitlers?
[00:10:05.455 --> 00:10:10.297]  That's what they're thinking because they are being misinformed by the media.
[00:10:10.677 --> 00:10:17.019]  Well, apparently after Handel, in her acceptance speech, she thanked the President.
[00:10:17.759 --> 00:10:20.920]  And so I wanted to roll to a clip of her thanking the President.
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.120]  So let's roll to that right now.
[00:10:22.881 --> 00:10:26.282]  Special thanks to the President of the United States of America.
[00:10:44.498 --> 00:10:50.147]  But let's not forget our equally great Vice President, Mike Pence.
[00:10:54.710 --> 00:11:05.475]  Now Handel won at 52% and Ossoff lost by 48% despite way outspending her in the campaign.
[00:11:05.975 --> 00:11:07.856]  Well, it's no surprise though.
[00:11:08.176 --> 00:11:14.979]  We saw so many people out there chanting and trying to support Handel and these liberals, they just think, why are we losing?
[00:11:15.459 --> 00:11:17.280]  Well, it's quite simple, Liberals.
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.622]  It's because the Democratic Party is imploding.
[00:11:20.962 --> 00:11:29.606]  It's become this echo chamber where you guys all just listen to celebrities and your Democratic politicians, the mainstream media.
[00:11:29.646 --> 00:11:41.112]  It's all liberal run and you're just bouncing the same rhetoric and soundbites amongst each other, not actually having dialogue and discussion into why people actually like Trump.
[00:11:41.152 --> 00:11:41.512]  I don't
[00:11:57.225 --> 00:12:07.574]  People out there that are being fueled by and, you know, inspired by the mainstream media going out there and attacking, physically attacking Trump supporters.
[00:12:07.955 --> 00:12:14.380]  Basically just saying, I don't really care why you support the man at this point because you guys are just all racist.
[00:12:14.421 --> 00:12:18.764]  They just blanket term everybody racist, which is absolutely not true.
[00:12:19.065 --> 00:12:20.946]  Now, I wanted to get into this video.
[00:12:21.707 --> 00:12:21.947]  That's right.
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.661]  Which is kind of funny because he's not very tiny.
[00:12:47.601 --> 00:12:49.802]  He's a man of Pacific Islander descent.
[00:12:50.283 --> 00:12:57.805]  And they put this video out from Joey Gibson's Facebook page who happened to speak at a lot of these other Berkeley rallies.
[00:12:58.165 --> 00:13:05.028]  So I wanted to kind of play part of this but I'm going to go over and I'm going to tell you about his story because it's absolutely amazing.
[00:13:05.408 --> 00:13:07.289]  Let's play some of this clip here.
[00:13:09.417 --> 00:13:10.398]  My name is Joey Gibson.
[00:13:10.438 --> 00:13:15.161]  I'm with Patriot Prayer, and this is my absolute pleasure to make this video.
[00:13:15.561 --> 00:13:18.263]  Make this video about a man named Tiny, who's not so tiny.
[00:13:18.603 --> 00:13:21.625]  Everywhere I go, people want to know, who is this man?
[00:13:22.066 --> 00:13:22.906]  What motivates him?
[00:13:22.986 --> 00:13:24.127]  What drives him?
[00:13:24.147 --> 00:13:26.969]  This man is a man of all heart.
[00:13:27.289 --> 00:13:28.050]  Tons of passion.
[00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:29.071]  Tons of inspiration.
[00:13:29.091 --> 00:13:30.992]  But there's a story behind him.
[00:13:31.718 --> 00:13:37.587]  That he has to tell and I believe it will impact so many people if you listen with an open heart and an open mind.
[00:13:37.627 --> 00:13:42.856]  There's a narrative in our country that there's no point... So there he is, there's Tiny and it looks like that's his son.
[00:13:43.416 --> 00:13:44.198]  But that is not true.
[00:13:44.859 --> 00:13:45.500]  That is a lie.
[00:13:46.155 --> 00:13:52.438]  And if you listen to what it is that Tani has to say, I believe that this will give you faith and give you hope.
[00:13:52.518 --> 00:14:04.505]  Yes, it's a very inspiring story and it has the ability to really open up the minds of some people out there who are anti-Trump and who have been fed these lies from the mainstream media.
[00:14:08.967 --> 00:14:10.368]  For those of you that do not know me,
[00:14:11.365 --> 00:14:12.585]  My name is Tiny.
[00:14:13.266 --> 00:14:16.627]  My real name is Tusi Tala Jones.
[00:14:17.427 --> 00:14:25.169]  I am 21 years old from the island of American Samoa and I'm part of this freedom movement that's going on.
[00:14:25.529 --> 00:14:32.832]  So I'm just going to kind of tell you guys a little bit about a story because it's a very long video and I do recommend you sit down and watch the entire video.
[00:14:33.132 --> 00:14:35.793]  It's on Joey Gibson's YouTube channel.
[00:14:36.273 --> 00:14:40.294]  But what's interesting here is now Tiny, he actually
[00:14:40.774 --> 00:14:47.040]  Didn't really care too much for or against Donald Trump in general.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.122]  He didn't even really know too much about him.
[00:14:49.442 --> 00:15:02.715]  But during the campaign season, when the mainstream media started covering more and more about Trump, he started watching the mainstream media and seeing how they were saying he was a racist and he was a bigot and he was this bad person.
[00:15:03.155 --> 00:15:07.498]  So he just kept watching this and thinking, oh my gosh, this guy's horrible.
[00:15:07.538 --> 00:15:10.780]  He's a bigot and just completely eating it up, believing it.
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:17.284]  And so what he said is that he started having this rage inside and this anger toward Donald Trump.
[00:15:17.645 --> 00:15:23.609]  So then when he would be out and he would see a Donald Trump supporter or see somebody driving with the Trump sticker on the car.
[00:15:24.489 --> 00:15:39.238]  He would take that rage out on those Trump supporters by either driving up next to them and, you know, shouting profanities or blasting music, blasting that song, you know, F Donald Trump and so on and so forth.
[00:15:39.898 --> 00:15:45.882]  And he actually said that he got so bad to where he liked watching videos of Trump supporters being attacked.
[00:15:46.642 --> 00:15:59.187]  And so one day when he was on the internet and he thought he was clicking on a video about Trump supporters being attacked, he clicked on a video and it happened to be this guy Joey Gibson speaking at a Donald Trump rally.
[00:15:59.627 --> 00:16:13.513]  Now he was actually really confused because he says that Joey Gibson's speech actually touched his heart and he was really confused because he thought, hey these guys are supposed to be racist bigots and rednecks and what this guy's saying
[00:16:14.173 --> 00:16:19.295]  He's saying he's not a racist and that he actually, you know, he just cares about the country and so on and so forth.
[00:16:19.675 --> 00:16:25.677]  So I guess he says he reached out to Joy Gibson on Facebook, but he still kind of was pretending.
[00:16:26.137 --> 00:16:33.019]  He wrote to him saying he was a Trump supporter, that he wanted to meet up with him because he was trying to investigate, but he still in his heart was not a Trump supporter.
[00:16:33.079 --> 00:16:34.539]  He wasn't convinced yet.
[00:16:35.159 --> 00:16:36.220]  And that basically
[00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:44.546]  He then goes and goes and meets up with Joey Gibson and a couple other guys and they picked him up.
[00:16:44.586 --> 00:16:55.594]  He tells this story about how he was a little bit scared at first because they were all white guys and he was worried that they were really maybe racist KKKs, that the mainstream media makes them out to be.
[00:16:56.195 --> 00:17:04.221]  And sure enough, as they were driving on their way to this event, they saw a Hispanic man broke down on the side of the road.
[00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:05.361]  I think so.
[00:17:28.072 --> 00:17:37.435]  And it's just a bunch of old people, children, families, people who, you know, they're just good-hearted Americans and they're not speaking anything about racism.
[00:17:37.455 --> 00:17:42.716]  They're not speaking anything about what the mainstream media tries to make Trump supporters out to be.
[00:17:42.776 --> 00:17:44.697]  They're just talking about how much they love the country.
[00:17:45.217 --> 00:17:56.569]  Then next thing you know he sees these Antifa who he didn't even know about and he says he was glad he didn't because he might have actually went and joined Antifa had he not had this experience.
[00:17:56.609 --> 00:17:57.670]  It opened his eyes.
[00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:01.153]  Now the Antifa came and we all know what happened at Berkeley.
[00:18:02.051 --> 00:18:02.431]  We're good to go.
[00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:43.825]  The information needs to be out there and this is why we're fighting the info war so that we can wake up people's minds and we can touch their hearts so that they can then have the wool pulled away from their eyes that the mainstream media puts in front of their eyes on a daily basis.
[00:18:44.085 --> 00:18:46.387]  So guys, go out there, share this story.
[00:18:46.687 --> 00:18:50.851]  I really hope that we can have Tiny on to speak with him and I'm sure we will.
[00:18:51.391 --> 00:18:55.295]  But just remember guys, this is the information war.
[00:18:55.495 --> 00:18:59.098]  Stay tuned guys, there's going to be some more reports after this short break.
[00:19:06.465 --> 00:19:13.009]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:19:13.589 --> 00:19:15.670]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.692]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:19:19.132 --> 00:19:20.433]  It's made in the USA.
[00:19:21.073 --> 00:19:29.438]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:19:29.798 --> 00:19:31.038]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:19:32.239 --> 00:19:36.083]  Our formula at Infowarslife.com is quite frankly simple.
[00:19:36.724 --> 00:19:45.152]  We go out and look at the recognized research and we take it to the next level of quality, of purity, and of strength.
[00:19:46.138 --> 00:19:49.519]  Because this is what I personally use for myself and my family.
[00:19:49.939 --> 00:19:57.522]  We've gone through five or six different permutations in the last four years, since we launched InfoWars Live, to actually come up with this.
[00:19:58.323 --> 00:20:02.084]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[00:20:02.464 --> 00:20:09.550]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:24.242]  If you're not mitigating the pesticides, the heavy metals, the chemicals, if you're not trying to purify your water, if you're not trying to take products like Z-Shield that are full of known concentrated compounds that'll purify our cells and our bodies, you're crazy!
[00:20:24.722 --> 00:20:30.287]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.041]  That patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:36.101 --> 00:20:44.363]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:20:44.563 --> 00:20:51.305]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the New World Order.
[00:20:52.315 --> 00:20:56.096]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:20:56.537 --> 00:21:00.878]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield and InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:21:01.478 --> 00:21:05.320]  I want to tell you about some of the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.201]  We are under constant attack.
[00:21:07.721 --> 00:21:09.922]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[00:21:10.122 --> 00:21:13.003]  They're trying to attack us on every level.
[00:21:13.043 --> 00:21:20.846]  Now with the YouTube scandal, they're demonetizing our channels, which again, takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why
[00:21:21.426 --> 00:21:27.470]  We always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[00:21:28.051 --> 00:21:29.692]  They can't get to us that way.
[00:21:30.052 --> 00:21:32.894]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[00:21:32.914 --> 00:21:33.894]  They don't have that power.
[00:21:34.355 --> 00:21:36.896]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[00:21:37.237 --> 00:21:39.658]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:21:40.099 --> 00:21:42.941]  Bubblegum Flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:21:42.961 --> 00:21:44.582]  This is by listener request.
[00:21:44.842 --> 00:21:50.085]  Bubblegum Flavored Super Blue Toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[00:21:50.105 --> 00:21:50.666]  Again,
[00:21:51.406 --> 00:21:57.152]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, then you're absolutely insane.
[00:21:57.573 --> 00:22:01.878]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[00:22:02.458 --> 00:22:06.282]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[00:22:08.346 --> 00:22:11.068]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from us?
[00:22:11.088 --> 00:22:29.501]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com with the new bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[00:22:29.821 --> 00:22:32.643]  We don't get put on extremist list even though they want us to.
[00:22:32.683 --> 00:22:34.724]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[00:22:35.065 --> 00:22:37.066]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[00:22:37.526 --> 00:22:48.934]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[00:22:49.174 --> 00:22:53.017]  So support us by getting the products at infowarsstore.com
[00:23:09.861 --> 00:23:13.543]  This is North Korea's lame excuse for a spy drone.
[00:23:13.764 --> 00:23:23.310]  Seoul military announced the drone contained 555 pictures, mainly of the THAAD anti-missile system currently parked on a Seoul golf course.
[00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:28.273]  Defense Ministry announced on Wednesday that the drone found in a remote border region was from North Korea.
[00:23:29.158 --> 00:23:35.261]  They say the drone was sent from Geumgang County in the north sometime in early May and crossed the military demarcation line.
[00:23:35.661 --> 00:23:39.883]  Analysis shows that the drone was sent from Geumgang County in the north on May 2nd.
[00:23:40.423 --> 00:23:47.526]  It surveilled Songju County where THAAD is deployed, then crashed on its way back, a clear indication that it was sent by Pyongyang.
[00:23:48.147 --> 00:23:55.070]  This act by North Korea is a clear military provocation, violating the arms disagreement and the bilateral non-aggression pact.
[00:23:55.470 --> 00:24:00.691]  This grave provocation could actually be the linchpin for action against North Korea.
[00:24:00.791 --> 00:24:08.893]  Chinese officials are meeting with the White House to review any final options of what has been a failed attempt at reining the rogue country in.
[00:24:09.014 --> 00:24:13.715]  The Chinese have a similar position to ours on this issue.
[00:24:13.735 --> 00:24:16.235]  They support denuclearization.
[00:24:16.595 --> 00:24:22.277]  They have also, as you know, announced a ban on the importation of DPRK coal.
[00:24:23.037 --> 00:24:24.038]  Thank you very much.
[00:24:45.785 --> 00:24:53.507]  Donald Trump has tweeted, while I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi and China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out.
[00:24:53.547 --> 00:24:55.108]  At least I know China tried.
[00:24:55.208 --> 00:25:06.291]  It's clear to me that Kim Jong-un, the regime, is on a path of attempting to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile and matching that with a nuclear warhead that can reach the United States.
[00:25:06.571 --> 00:25:08.332]  We should be concerned about that and we are.
[00:25:08.922 --> 00:25:14.604]  The primary means of dealing with that is diplomatic and economic pressure, a campaign led by Secretary Tillerson.
[00:25:15.004 --> 00:25:19.146]  The military dimension on a day-to-day basis is in support of Secretary Tillerson.
[00:25:19.226 --> 00:25:33.891]  As a result, we have a very open dialogue, a very aggressive dialogue with the State Department to make sure that everything that we're doing, everything that we're doing in terms of our military posture, is supportive of Secretary Tillerson's primarily economic and diplomatic campaign.
[00:25:34.091 --> 00:25:37.812]  The United States remains committed to holding North Korea accountable
[00:25:38.322 --> 00:25:38.622]  Thank you.
[00:26:01.769 --> 00:26:02.189]  The U.S.
[00:26:02.229 --> 00:26:09.893]  military is preparing for what may be the sixth nuclear test by North Korea, a move that could easily cause a military response.
[00:26:10.053 --> 00:26:17.798]  Four-star General Jack Keane says that bombing North Korea may be the only option left, but that won't be an easy task.
[00:26:17.998 --> 00:26:24.081]  As Michael Snyder points out, bombing North Korea is not like bombing Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya or Syria.
[00:26:24.441 --> 00:26:27.862]  The North Koreans already have nuclear weapons and the U.S.
[00:26:27.943 --> 00:26:35.806]  better destroy them all in an overwhelming initial assault because Kim Jong-un will use any that survive to strike back.
[00:26:36.066 --> 00:26:49.371]  Meanwhile, Yonhap News Agency reports North Korea's top envoy to India on Wednesday offered a conditional moratorium on his country's nuclear and missile tests in an apparent bid to hold talks with the United States.
[00:26:49.551 --> 00:26:51.592]  North Korea ambassador to India
[00:26:51.792 --> 00:26:59.477]  Kee Chung Yong said Pyongyang is willing to talk in terms of freezing its nuclear and missile tests under certain circumstances.
[00:26:59.777 --> 00:27:07.663]  Kee said in English, if our demands is met, we can negotiate in terms of the moratorium of such as weapons testing.
[00:27:07.763 --> 00:27:17.129]  He suggested that one of the key demands is the halt of the US joint military drills with South Korea, which Pyongyang denounced as a rehearsal for invasion.
[00:27:17.469 --> 00:27:21.612]  Seoul and Washington say their annual exercises are defensive in nature.
[00:27:21.892 --> 00:27:23.313]  Good luck with that, Pyongyang.
[00:27:23.453 --> 00:27:37.622]  The last moratorium on missiles and nuclear tests unraveled after just two months back in 2012, and South Korean President Moon has no intention of scaling back so that North Korea can obviously launch an unprecedented attack.
[00:27:37.782 --> 00:27:42.625]  How about freeing the three Americans held in your prisons first, and then we can talk?
[00:27:42.845 --> 00:27:44.866]  John Bowne for Infowars.com.
[00:27:49.531 --> 00:27:57.175]  Leftists in Europe carried out 27 terror attacks in 2016, which debunks the claim that conservatives and libertarians represent a bigger extremist threat.
[00:27:57.335 --> 00:28:02.197]  Over 140 terrorist attacks occurred in Europe last year, and 27 of them were blamed on leftists.
[00:28:02.337 --> 00:28:06.279]  In comparison, just one right-wing terror attack was recorded for the entire year.
[00:28:06.639 --> 00:28:11.542]  13 attacks were blamed on jihadis, while the majority of the attacks, nearly 100, were by separatist movements.
[00:28:11.842 --> 00:28:15.784]  Terrorist attacks which led to deaths and injuries are almost exclusively Islamic.
[00:28:16.064 --> 00:28:19.267]  And guess who advocates open borders and radical Islam?
[00:28:19.547 --> 00:28:20.167]  It's the left.
[00:28:20.347 --> 00:28:24.991]  The statistics disprove the narrative that conservatives and libertarians represent a major terrorist threat.
[00:28:25.171 --> 00:28:28.974]  A claim the mainstream media was pushing after the recent attack on Muslims near a mosque in London.
[00:28:29.074 --> 00:28:34.558]  The study came from Europol, a law enforcement agency of the European Union tasked with combating organized crime and terrorism.
[00:28:34.698 --> 00:28:36.380]  Additionally, terror experts in the U.S.
[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:40.543]  are also warning that left-wing terror represents a far bigger concern than ever before.
[00:28:40.783 --> 00:28:44.786]  Which isn't surprising given how the establishment keeps promoting violence against President Trump.
[00:28:45.007 --> 00:28:47.500]  You can find out more at InfoWars.com.
[00:28:47.761 --> 00:28:48.948]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[00:28:59.318 --> 00:29:03.840]  First tonight, our report on the incendiary radio host, Alex Jones.
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:08.441]  Media personality Alex Jones is taking on Megyn Kelly of NBC.
[00:29:08.501 --> 00:29:11.663]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones.
[00:29:11.743 --> 00:29:16.825]  Megyn Kelly's been taking a lot of heat for interviewing radio show host Alex Jones.
[00:29:16.885 --> 00:29:21.606]  He's admitted in court documents for his divorce that he doesn't believe in what he's saying and he's playing a character.
[00:29:21.766 --> 00:29:23.847]  Alex Jones promotes conspiracy theories.
[00:29:23.887 --> 00:29:25.548]  He's one of those guys who believes in conspiracy theories.
[00:29:25.988 --> 00:29:27.409]  Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11.
[00:29:27.449 --> 00:29:30.230]  I know you're not Alex Jones so I know it's true!
[00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:35.972]  An escalating battle over Megyn Kelly's NBC interview with radio host Alex Jones has taken a bizarre turn.
[00:29:36.072 --> 00:29:42.415]  InfoWars host Alex Jones is threatening to release a secretly recorded audio taping of the full interview.
[00:29:42.795 --> 00:29:47.276]  It turns out, before Kelly recorded that interview, Jones recorded Kelly.
[00:29:47.496 --> 00:29:51.897]  Jones has called for NBC to release the full, unedited version of the interview.
[00:29:52.317 --> 00:29:54.718]  And by the way, in this case, I have to agree.
[00:29:54.738 --> 00:29:56.778]  Jones has been spreading conspiracy theories.
[00:29:56.998 --> 00:30:04.280]  Kelly says that she's revolted by Jones's outrageous conspiracy theories, with Jones releasing phone calls of Kelly's attempts to book him.
[00:30:13.377 --> 00:30:16.259]  Alex Jones taped Megyn Kelly, which was fascinating.
[00:30:16.479 --> 00:30:19.341]  He actually taped her pitching him coming on her show.
[00:30:19.461 --> 00:30:22.063]  Jones released part of his conversations with Kelly.
[00:30:22.083 --> 00:30:23.484]  He apparently was recording everything.
[00:30:23.564 --> 00:30:31.649]  Media provocateur Alex Jones got the jump on NBC's Megyn Kelly this week, releasing secret tapes of her pre-interview negotiations with him.
[00:30:31.829 --> 00:30:36.513]  At one point in the audio, Kelly promises to go easy and, you know, this won't be a gotcha piece.
[00:30:36.533 --> 00:30:37.874]  She's not out to get him.
[00:30:37.994 --> 00:30:38.974]  I knew it was a fraud.
[00:30:39.435 --> 00:30:40.395]  I knew it was a lie.
[00:30:40.695 --> 00:30:41.516]  It doesn't serve me.
[00:30:46.776 --> 00:30:50.139]  I swear I won't ask any tougher questions than I asked of Putin.
[00:30:50.339 --> 00:30:50.600]  Right.
[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:56.505]  NBC News should release the tapes, the full tapes of the Alex Jones interview.
[00:30:56.725 --> 00:30:57.986]  Let Americans decide.
[00:30:58.026 --> 00:30:59.287]  But it gets crazier.
[00:31:00.048 --> 00:31:02.290]  And this really just is so disgusting.
[00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:07.975]  Jones argues, based on the promo NBC has released, Kelly's interview won't fairly portray his views.
[00:31:08.175 --> 00:31:10.996]  It's not gonna be some gotcha hippies, I promise you that.
[00:31:11.036 --> 00:31:14.418]  The reach and the poisonous claims of Alex Jones.
[00:31:14.658 --> 00:31:16.079]  The deep, dark hate.
[00:31:16.159 --> 00:31:19.920]  His baseless allegations aren't just offensive, they're dangerous.
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.901]  I think Alex Jones is disgusting.
[00:31:22.021 --> 00:31:23.602]  I think the things he says are awful.
[00:31:23.622 --> 00:31:24.882]  He makes me physically sick.
[00:31:25.623 --> 00:31:34.066]  The fact is that he is an unalloyed racist, a man who is out there pulling the pin on the grenade every day, and he has six million viewers.
[00:31:34.387 --> 00:31:35.147]  Alex Jones!
[00:31:35.527 --> 00:31:36.228]  Alex Jones.
[00:31:36.288 --> 00:31:37.288]  From InfoWars.
[00:31:37.348 --> 00:31:38.069]  InfoWars.
[00:31:38.169 --> 00:31:39.250]  Like InfoWars.
[00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:40.530]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[00:31:40.771 --> 00:31:43.953]  InfoWars is the brainchild of radio host Alex Jones.
[00:31:43.993 --> 00:31:46.374]  He's been called a freak show and downright dangerous.
[00:31:46.695 --> 00:31:47.835]  Toxic paranoia.
[00:31:48.116 --> 00:31:54.940]  I'm talking about far-right radio host and guy getting arrested at mini-golf, Alex Jones.
[00:31:55.661 --> 00:31:56.701]  Alex Jones is a virus.
[00:31:59.585 --> 00:32:04.500]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:32:04.741 --> 00:32:05.985]  InfoWars.com.
[00:32:06.145 --> 00:32:07.429]  I was recording the whole time.
[00:32:15.748 --> 00:32:19.912]  You traitors claiming I'm a Ruski agent, say it to my face and I'll break your nose.
[00:32:20.132 --> 00:32:20.793]  I'm sick of it.
[00:32:21.033 --> 00:32:24.036]  I will stomp your head in the ground, you traitorous maggots.
[00:32:24.296 --> 00:32:37.488]  While we go under Obamacare, North American Union, conquered by European banks, announcing our kids don't belong to us, total bondage, total surveillance, and you want to shoot your mouth off about me being a Ruski agent, I will stomp your head in the ground.
[00:32:37.728 --> 00:32:43.470]  Never water yourself down just because someone can't handle you at 100 proof.
[00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:47.751]  It's the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:02.645 --> 00:33:03.966]  Why is the fungus?
[00:33:04.046 --> 00:33:05.006]  Why is the mold?
[00:33:05.126 --> 00:33:06.587]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[00:33:06.887 --> 00:33:07.688]  What is going on?
[00:33:07.848 --> 00:33:08.608]  What has changed?
[00:33:09.008 --> 00:33:11.209]  Dr. Group, the new product will sell out definitely in days.
[00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:13.130]  You've been testing it for almost a decade.
[00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:16.752]  You've got rave reviews from your patients who've been taking it privately at your clinics.
[00:33:16.992 --> 00:33:23.836]  MycoZX supports normal fungal and yeast balanced proprietary blend of herbs and enzymes made with high quality ingredients.
[00:33:24.116 --> 00:33:25.857]  It's available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:33:25.937 --> 00:33:30.038]  We also have free shipping, orders for $50 or more and 10% off when you sign up for auto-ship.
[00:33:30.118 --> 00:33:38.440]  Additionally, on top of that, I mean, you fund an organization dedicated to the truth and get something you and your family absolutely need, but you should consult your healthcare provider.
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:39.221]  This is not a game.
[00:33:39.241 --> 00:33:43.482]  This is not a joke, especially if you have really big yeast levels or fungus in your body.
[00:33:43.502 --> 00:33:49.024]  You know, there can be some responses to this as you're flushing it, but why is this product so powerful?
[00:33:49.064 --> 00:33:49.524]  What does it do?
[00:33:49.904 --> 00:33:53.848]  So, we've been doing research, just like you have, on what's currently going on.
[00:33:54.068 --> 00:34:01.455]  Obviously, we stay ahead of the game because our job is to protect and address the root cause of the problem, which is why I've been... No, we want stuff for our own kids.
[00:34:02.056 --> 00:34:04.638]  Well, we've been... This is why we've addressed...
[00:34:05.399 --> 00:34:13.226]  The President, you know, let's address the root cause of America's health problems, but getting back to fungus, it's becoming an increasing epidemic that's only getting worse.
[00:34:13.246 --> 00:34:16.148]  It's killing bats everywhere, other animals, squirrels are dying.
[00:34:16.188 --> 00:34:18.610]  Funguses were used as bioweapons to wipe out rice fields.
[00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:20.412]  So why is it suddenly killing so many mammals?
[00:34:20.652 --> 00:34:27.895]  Yeah, fungus is a growing epidemic, and I've been testing this formula and making changes to this formula for over 10 years.
[00:34:28.375 --> 00:34:30.596]  I've had nobody... Here's the thing, Alex.
[00:34:30.756 --> 00:34:37.218]  When you go to the doctor with a list of symptoms, you can look at symptoms of fungus overgrowth in the body.
[00:34:37.758 --> 00:34:40.659]  It's going to show... You're going to pull up over a hundred symptoms.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.401]  Everything from brain fog, lack of energy, insomnia, headaches, bowel problems.
[00:34:45.421 --> 00:34:45.961]  Joint pain.
[00:34:46.102 --> 00:34:46.842]  It's joint pain.
[00:34:46.902 --> 00:34:48.122]  It's linked to Crohn's disease.
[00:34:48.162 --> 00:34:48.702]  Infertility.
[00:34:48.723 --> 00:34:49.823]  What about the obesity epidemic?
[00:34:50.163 --> 00:34:52.545]  I know they test people that are really obese.
[00:34:52.565 --> 00:34:55.187]  They're just colonized by fungus.
[00:34:55.367 --> 00:34:56.208]  Yeast overgrowth?
[00:34:56.228 --> 00:35:00.911]  I have a study right here by Jacob Titobaum at the Fibromyalgia and Fatigue Center in Dallas.
[00:35:00.971 --> 00:35:05.595]  Yeast overgrowth is linked to an average weight gain of 32 and a half pounds.
[00:35:06.355 --> 00:35:09.378]  By the way, folks, I'm not bragging.
[00:35:09.598 --> 00:35:11.199]  We game-changed the presidency.
[00:35:11.219 --> 00:35:12.720]  We game-changed the New World Order.
[00:35:13.001 --> 00:35:14.602]  Globalism is falling because of you.
[00:35:14.722 --> 00:35:15.723]  You are the Infowar.
[00:35:16.964 --> 00:35:17.884]  This is religious for me.
[00:35:19.384 --> 00:35:21.965]  I do not bring you something unless I absolutely believe in it.
[00:35:22.886 --> 00:35:26.748]  And if we were reigned with a billion dollars, I would turn 99% of it against the enemy.
[00:35:27.728 --> 00:35:28.749]  I want to defeat them.
[00:35:28.849 --> 00:35:31.070]  I'm ready to give my life, everybody knows that, against the enemy.
[00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:34.312]  Please, we only have a limited supply of this.
[00:35:34.772 --> 00:35:36.293]  I want to get your reviews, I want to hear what you have to say.
[00:35:36.313 --> 00:35:37.193]  For me, it's been incredible.
[00:35:37.773 --> 00:35:42.215]  MycoZX, antifungal, antifungus, anti-yeast.
[00:35:42.276 --> 00:35:43.576]  Get it today, limited run.
[00:35:43.596 --> 00:35:44.597]  It'll be months till we get more.
[00:35:44.997 --> 00:35:46.958]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[00:35:47.378 --> 00:35:48.880]  Let's go to Debit in Florida.
[00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.862]  Debit in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:36:08.965 --> 00:36:09.305]  Great.
[00:36:09.385 --> 00:36:10.386]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:36:10.506 --> 00:36:14.890]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.611]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[00:36:16.751 --> 00:36:24.257]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, 5-Minute Interfusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[00:36:24.337 --> 00:36:25.118]  Wow, thank you.
[00:36:25.138 --> 00:36:27.480]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.121]  Which Nutra-Certical does you like best?
[00:36:29.361 --> 00:36:32.682]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[00:36:32.842 --> 00:36:33.883]  That's really incredible.
[00:36:34.103 --> 00:36:37.304]  I drank it in the morning, and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[00:36:37.504 --> 00:36:38.464]  I haven't felt sleep.
[00:36:38.544 --> 00:36:41.345]  My morning was fantastic, and I love you guys.
[00:36:41.426 --> 00:36:50.289]  I love the InfoWars crew, and I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[00:36:50.449 --> 00:36:51.269]  You will love it.
[00:36:51.489 --> 00:36:51.949]  I'm telling you.
[00:36:51.989 --> 00:36:53.310]  I've never bought a bad product.
[00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:57.999]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:36:58.039 --> 00:36:58.801]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:58.921 --> 00:36:59.883]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:37:02.475 --> 00:37:10.121]  Leftists in Europe carried out 27 terror attacks in 2016, which debunks the claim that conservatives and libertarians represent a bigger extremist threat.
[00:37:10.281 --> 00:37:15.145]  Over 140 terrorist attacks occurred in Europe last year, and 27 of them were blamed on leftists.
[00:37:15.285 --> 00:37:19.228]  In comparison, just one right-wing terror attack was recorded for the entire year.
[00:37:19.248 --> 00:37:24.513]  13 attacks were blamed on jihadis, while the majority of the attacks, nearly 100, were by separatist movements.
[00:37:24.813 --> 00:37:28.756]  Terrorist attacks which led to deaths and injuries are almost exclusively Islamic.
[00:37:29.016 --> 00:37:32.238]  And guess who advocates open borders and radical Islam?
[00:37:32.518 --> 00:37:33.119]  It's the left.
[00:37:33.299 --> 00:37:41.925]  The statistics disprove the narrative that conservatives and libertarians represent a major terrorist threat, a claim the mainstream media was pushing after the recent attack on Muslims near a mosque in London.
[00:37:42.045 --> 00:37:47.508]  The study came from Europol, a law enforcement agency of the European Union tasked with combating organized crime and terrorism.
[00:37:47.648 --> 00:37:49.329]  Additionally, terror experts in the U.S.
[00:37:49.369 --> 00:37:57.735]  are also warning that left-wing terror represents a far bigger concern than ever before, which isn't surprising given how the establishment keeps promoting violence against President Trump.
[00:37:57.976 --> 00:38:00.449]  You can find out more at InfoWars.com.
[00:38:00.711 --> 00:38:01.898]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[00:38:21.877 --> 00:38:28.105]  Say what you want about President Trump, but we dodged a bullet when Hillary Rodham Clinton didn't get elected in 2016.
[00:38:28.545 --> 00:38:36.876]  And we have seen every element of global corruption come after President Trump and come after the American people.
[00:38:38.103 --> 00:38:50.214]  We've also seen multinational corporations, intelligence agencies, the big universities, the MSM media, come after free speech and come after InfoWars.com.
[00:38:50.914 --> 00:38:51.635]  And why is that?
[00:38:52.396 --> 00:38:56.179]  InfoWars did not invent Americana or the modern renaissance.
[00:38:56.700 --> 00:39:00.923]  We're simply bringing it back and comparing it historically
[00:39:01.584 --> 00:39:08.970]  To the type of socialism and corporate cronyism that we have been seeing in the last few decades in Europe and the United States.
[00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:18.557]  We know socialism and communism leads to total collapse, like we've seen in Venezuela, North Korea, the old Soviet Union, and so many other examples.
[00:39:19.398 --> 00:39:23.100]  But the modern model of socialism has been disastrous as well.
[00:39:23.781 --> 00:39:30.145]  It is a predatory system that seeks to dumb down the general population and have a tiny elite on top of it.
[00:39:30.685 --> 00:39:45.274]  That's why some of the richest men in the world like Carlos Slim, the kingpin of Mexico, and Jeff Bezos of Amazon, the CIA, and the Washington Post are waging war against Infowars.com through their media organs and calling for
[00:39:45.834 --> 00:39:53.459]  My radio show, my TV transmissions and our websites to be shut down because they don't want you to have a focal point.
[00:39:53.679 --> 00:39:59.963]  They don't want you or we the people to have a system that will challenge their lives.
[00:40:00.604 --> 00:40:09.870]  That's why it's more important for all of you as this 4th of July approaches to understand most of us that are just good decent honest people don't think of ourselves as much.
[00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:11.051]  We're just
[00:40:12.594 --> 00:40:16.376]  Humble folks who want to live our lives and enjoy a piece of the American pie.
[00:40:17.356 --> 00:40:22.579]  But the globalists see our independence and see our love of freedom as a threat because they're authoritarians.
[00:40:23.199 --> 00:40:33.445]  And that's why, not just here in America's 245 year history, but all over the world, elites will never let the little people simply live their lives and be productive.
[00:40:34.105 --> 00:40:36.967]  They want total control over the population.
[00:40:37.468 --> 00:40:39.469]  And that's why they're waging war against Infowars.
[00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:45.814]  Because they know it is the people's media promoting justice, freedom, and prosperity.
[00:40:46.015 --> 00:40:46.975]  Transcending race.
[00:40:47.796 --> 00:40:49.357]  Transcending ethnicity.
[00:40:49.938 --> 00:40:52.880]  Transcending even mainline establishment religions.
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:41:02.528]  And bringing people together around the idea of free association and a free market of ideas that we know in history has been the developer of all the major
[00:41:02.788 --> 00:41:03.008]  I think?
[00:41:23.598 --> 00:41:31.501]  To the face of this global system and letting it know that you won't submit and also standing up so that others can see your action and that gives them courage.
[00:41:32.201 --> 00:41:34.102]  So again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:41:34.602 --> 00:41:35.902]  I want to thank you for your prayers.
[00:41:36.342 --> 00:41:40.944]  You have changed the world and I want to encourage you to continue to change the world.
[00:41:41.144 --> 00:41:41.404]  I think so.
[00:42:05.016 --> 00:42:12.629]  And because we literally are spreading the light of justice and freedom throughout the darkness that is this global New World Order system.
[00:42:13.732 --> 00:42:16.714]  The United States became the example of freedom worldwide.
[00:42:17.255 --> 00:42:23.079]  Not because we were perfect, but because we delivered on freedom and prosperity unlike any other country in history.
[00:42:23.579 --> 00:42:29.584]  And that's why the globalist technocrats are trying to destroy America, and that's why they hate Infowars, and that's why they hate you so much.
[00:42:30.164 --> 00:42:41.593]  It is so critical this July 4th that we re-declare our independence against the globalists and understand that your support of the Infowar has already shaken the globalists to their very core.
[00:42:42.133 --> 00:42:45.795]  That's why this July 4th, we're having some of the biggest sales ever.

[00:43:39.204 --> 00:43:46.647]  It's got all the key herbs, the zeolites, the shilajit, concentrated and known to pull out heavy metals and toxins from the body.
[00:43:46.887 --> 00:43:49.668]  Do yourself and your family a favor and help fund the InfoWar.
[00:43:50.348 --> 00:43:51.929]  Get yourself a bottle of Z-Shield.
[00:43:52.469 --> 00:43:54.411]  Emmerich's Essentials Outdoor Special.
[00:43:54.712 --> 00:44:08.767]  We're talking our non-nano zinc, incredibly concentrated, high-powered sunscreen, along with Emmerich's Essentials bug spray that's totally organic and natural and works way better than chemical brands I've personally used.
[00:44:09.068 --> 00:44:13.332]  In the modern world, we can use good consumerism as a weapon.
[00:44:13.993 --> 00:44:18.756]  The globalists and the leftists use their boycotts, use their money control to manipulate our lives.
[00:44:18.776 --> 00:44:25.601]  They take our tax money and give it to NBC as stimulus money to then be anti-gun, anti-freedom, anti-sovereignty.
[00:44:25.861 --> 00:44:26.462]  It's that simple.
[00:44:26.882 --> 00:44:38.110]  But if you will shop with the good guys like Infowarsstore.com and Infowarslife.com, we can continue to build an independent economy system that's a win-win for everybody, that promotes freedom.
[00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:40.512]  That's why they're so scared of Infowars.
[00:44:41.232 --> 00:44:54.219]  They're scared of you using your independent media freedom and your independent freedom to purchase high quality products that support freedom to overthrow their system by pulling your financing away from the globalists.
[00:44:54.639 --> 00:44:59.022]  I don't point a gun at you like the IRS and then take your money and give it to globalist causes.
[00:44:59.622 --> 00:45:11.630]  I just bring you high quality discounted products that you and your family need that then the profits we make in turn are put into expanding InfoWars operations against the globalists because the stakes are so high.
[00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:21.737]  So again, thank you all for your support of InfoWars and I want to encourage you all to recommit as this July 4th approaches to intensify our efforts to defeat the globalists.
[00:45:21.997 --> 00:45:26.260]  We can do it, but we've got to continue to press the attack and we've got to continue to pray to God.
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:28.982]  So for myself, the InfoWars crew and my family,
[00:45:29.542 --> 00:45:33.954]  I want to wish you all a wonderful 4th of July, and I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:45:40.714 --> 00:45:44.195]  The Federal Reserve is a private banking cartel.
[00:45:44.215 --> 00:45:47.677]  The Fed is a sometimes very independent organization.
[00:45:47.737 --> 00:45:52.539]  What should be the proper relationship between the Chairman of the Fed and a President of the United States?
[00:45:52.559 --> 00:45:55.480]  The Federal Reserve is an independent agency.
[00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:59.902]  There is no other agency of government which can overrule the Federal Reserve.
[00:46:00.422 --> 00:46:01.062]  I think so.
[00:46:18.013 --> 00:46:26.695]  ...is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing, then what the relationships are don't frankly matter.
[00:46:26.855 --> 00:46:31.976]  Jeff Duncan says he saw IRS special agents using semi-automatic rifles at a gun range.
[00:46:32.496 --> 00:46:36.076]  Now he wants answers to why the agency needs that type of firepower.
[00:46:36.256 --> 00:46:38.297]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:46:38.377 --> 00:46:40.777]  Is it one world the central bank is in charge?
[00:46:40.857 --> 00:46:43.238]  Know your history and you will know your enemy.
[00:46:43.578 --> 00:46:44.678]  InfoWars.com
[00:47:02.975 --> 00:47:07.758]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.418 --> 00:47:10.019]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.399 --> 00:47:15.402]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.762 --> 00:47:21.206]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.606 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.413]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.433 --> 00:48:49.473]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.814 --> 00:48:50.514]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.534 --> 00:48:51.155]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.515 --> 00:48:59.060]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine X2 at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:48:59.961]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.981 --> 00:49:00.021]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:09.192 --> 00:49:19.721]  Well, a lot of liberals in Hollywood and in the music industry are putting out anti-Trump propaganda on the regular, and so we are here to break it down for you in real time.
[00:49:20.101 --> 00:49:26.066]  Now, most of this anti-Trump propaganda, I think, truly just has despicable roots.
[00:49:26.366 --> 00:49:37.436]  For example, Snoop Dogg pretending to shoot President Trump in a music video, or the New York theater displaying the assassination or depicting the assassination of Donald Trump.
[00:49:37.816 --> 00:49:53.477]  But there's also other propaganda that's a little more nuanced and I don't think necessarily as deeply rooted as in evil as some of the other stuff we've seen and that one of those would be a music video just released by Moby and the Void Pacific Choir.
[00:49:54.218 --> 00:50:01.903]  Now this video is entitled In This Cold Place, and we're going to play this video and I'm going to break down some of the stuff that you see in this video.
[00:50:02.364 --> 00:50:16.434]  But the one thing that I wanted to mention before I played the video was, it's amazing how we see this propaganda in forms of art coming from liberals, but it only seems to be coming out when there's a Republican in office.
[00:50:16.954 --> 00:50:21.958]  For eight years under Obama, we didn't see any of this type of propaganda coming out.
[00:50:22.278 --> 00:50:31.345]  We didn't see any of it coming out of Hollywood, coming out of the music industry, against the President, against the United States, against the U.S.
[00:50:31.365 --> 00:50:31.685]  government.
[00:50:31.986 --> 00:50:38.431]  So it's amazing how biased it really is, and I think that really just goes to show you the intent
[00:50:39.091 --> 00:50:40.312]  of this propaganda.
[00:50:40.352 --> 00:50:49.298]  Not to wake people up, not to expose people to the truth, but really it's just a political strike against conservatives, against Americans.
[00:50:49.698 --> 00:50:55.763]  Now here is the video in this cold place by Moby and the Void Pacific Choir.
[00:50:55.843 --> 00:50:58.064]  I will be breaking it down in real time.
[00:50:58.084 --> 00:50:59.065]  Go ahead and roll that video.
[00:51:03.848 --> 00:51:06.230]  So apparently this is the first episode and he's going to make more.
[00:51:07.537 --> 00:51:08.878]  But we'll wait for that.
[00:51:11.419 --> 00:51:13.300]  There's the American city bringing us in.
[00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:23.004]  And the American, surrounded by his cool toys, staring into the TV that has all the color, all the life.
[00:51:24.139 --> 00:51:25.120]  That is his reality.
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:30.742]  Everything else around him is dark and dull, and the television sucks him in, has all the light.
[00:51:31.282 --> 00:51:32.203]  That's what he follows.
[00:51:32.263 --> 00:51:35.745]  And then, of course, there's the depiction of American cartoons.
[00:51:37.365 --> 00:51:40.267]  And now, all of a sudden, the media is telling him that it's fighting.
[00:51:40.327 --> 00:51:41.027]  Everything's bad.
[00:51:41.107 --> 00:51:41.788]  Build a wall.
[00:51:43.248 --> 00:51:44.929]  The TV is now teaching bigotry.
[00:51:45.029 --> 00:51:46.210]  Oh, here's the police state.
[00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:47.090]  The police are bad.
[00:51:47.130 --> 00:51:48.010]  Everybody coming in.
[00:51:48.571 --> 00:51:50.692]  Oh, it's all about getting drunk and having sex.
[00:51:52.011 --> 00:51:56.452]  There another, you can see, now the parents are fighting again because of the media.
[00:51:57.292 --> 00:51:59.773]  And again, the kid still stares into the TV.
[00:51:59.813 --> 00:52:00.773]  He's now older now.
[00:52:01.573 --> 00:52:04.554]  Just staring into the TV as life goes around and lifeless.
[00:52:05.514 --> 00:52:07.715]  His life is stuck inside of the tube.
[00:52:08.135 --> 00:52:10.955]  Oh, there's the nice, uh, produced food that we have.
[00:52:11.315 --> 00:52:13.056]  There's the human working without his soul.
[00:52:13.556 --> 00:52:15.276]  There's big industry destroying the earth.
[00:52:15.436 --> 00:52:16.377]  There's the consumer.
[00:52:16.437 --> 00:52:17.717]  There's the poison in the water.
[00:52:18.397 --> 00:52:19.297]  All of this is good.
[00:52:19.397 --> 00:52:21.618]  There's the reptiles in government.
[00:52:21.658 --> 00:52:25.339]  There's the government leader with his lying nose going all the way around the planet.
[00:52:25.359 --> 00:52:27.060]  That's Obama, though, by the way.
[00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:32.922]  So again, this is all stuff that you kind of say, oh, okay, I kind of understand where they're going with this propaganda.
[00:52:33.282 --> 00:52:37.843]  I can understand kind of the message that they're trying to depict here.
[00:52:38.383 --> 00:52:39.524]  Yeah, meet the new boss.
[00:52:39.544 --> 00:52:40.524]  Same as the old boss.
[00:52:40.704 --> 00:52:41.544]  But they're all Nazis.
[00:52:41.584 --> 00:52:42.525]  That's a leftist tactic.
[00:52:43.445 --> 00:52:46.707]  And there he still is, the same guy, still staring into the television.
[00:52:46.747 --> 00:52:48.087]  Now here's the Trump propaganda.
[00:52:48.948 --> 00:52:53.250]  So they try to make Trump into be some rich superhero.
[00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:54.291]  It's not even about money.
[00:52:54.331 --> 00:52:55.351]  In fact, Trump cut.
[00:52:56.192 --> 00:52:57.432]  He's not making any money now.
[00:52:57.712 --> 00:52:59.233]  He's donating his salary.
[00:52:59.713 --> 00:53:02.035]  And then you can see again the food industry that they're hitting.
[00:53:02.075 --> 00:53:02.995]  But now back to Trump.
[00:53:02.995 --> 00:53:03.175]  Trump.
[00:53:03.235 --> 00:53:03.515]  Trump.
[00:53:03.555 --> 00:53:04.376]  It's all about his money.
[00:53:04.396 --> 00:53:05.257]  It's all about his money.
[00:53:05.417 --> 00:53:06.398]  Oh yeah, he's a joke.
[00:53:06.438 --> 00:53:08.519]  He comes in riding this rich money thing.
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:11.422]  No, that's not what it was about at all.
[00:53:11.462 --> 00:53:14.084]  Now you can see the consumer getting boxed in by everything.
[00:53:14.604 --> 00:53:16.766]  Meanwhile, the fat cat makes off with all the gold.
[00:53:17.066 --> 00:53:23.611]  And he's still stuck in front of the TV, still looking at the false reality that the TV is portraying for him.
[00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:32.925]  But here's the twist that's about to come down with the President Trump portion of this that they're trying to spin, in my opinion.
[00:53:33.345 --> 00:53:34.646]  Oh, yeah, tear down the walls.
[00:53:35.226 --> 00:53:42.831]  And again, look, you know, you see some of this stuff, you say, OK, I kind of understand the overarching picture as the guy stares at the television, everything that's going on behind him.
[00:53:44.363 --> 00:53:47.567]  But they try to make out Trump to be something he's not.
[00:53:47.807 --> 00:53:48.308]  A liar.
[00:53:48.428 --> 00:53:49.189]  That's not true.
[00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:55.096]  And now Trump disappears because he told the truth and he had a malfunction.
[00:53:55.837 --> 00:53:57.238]  Again, totally inaccurate.
[00:53:57.999 --> 00:54:01.484]  And there's the... I guess that's the end of the video.
[00:54:01.504 --> 00:54:02.385]  Is that the end of the video, guys?
[00:54:04.366 --> 00:54:04.966]  So there you go.
[00:54:05.106 --> 00:54:06.227]  So there's the video.
[00:54:06.367 --> 00:54:07.307]  Now, here's the thing.
[00:54:08.048 --> 00:54:15.632]  All of the propaganda in that video with the food industry, the lying politicians, and all that stuff that we saw, we get that.
[00:54:15.692 --> 00:54:16.372]  We understand that.
[00:54:16.412 --> 00:54:17.292]  We've been reporting on it.
[00:54:18.153 --> 00:54:23.916]  Trump represents the people that have been red-pilled or woke that are trying to change it.
[00:54:24.696 --> 00:54:25.777]  So that's the spin.
[00:54:25.897 --> 00:54:26.737]  That's the twist.
[00:54:26.917 --> 00:54:30.199]  That's the propaganda that needs to be called out, that Moby needs to understand.
[00:54:31.226 --> 00:54:34.927]  President Trump is representing the people that want to fight the corruption.
[00:54:35.387 --> 00:54:39.608]  President Trump is putting out truth that's shutting down the establishment.
[00:54:39.688 --> 00:54:40.488]  Not the opposite.
[00:54:40.728 --> 00:54:42.529]  Not Trump speaks the truth and shuts down.
[00:54:43.009 --> 00:54:45.850]  Trump speaks the truth and the establishment collapses.
[00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:48.670]  So, we wanted to cover that video from Moby.
[00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:49.931]  Again, more liberal propaganda.
[00:54:50.211 --> 00:54:55.452]  And then, you know, you look at the lyrics, really it just looks like a sad, pathetic, liberal poem, to be honest with you.
[00:54:56.552 --> 00:55:02.357]  But again, they want to spin this to say that President Trump is a liar, part of the establishment, part of the problem.
[00:55:02.717 --> 00:55:11.044]  No, Trump is representing the people that want to stop the establishment from being the problem, and Trump, the truth coming out of his mouth, is the one that's shutting the establishment down.
[00:55:17.269 --> 00:55:24.575]  Brain Fight is brought to you by Brain Fart Plus with extra fluoride so that your days are happy and dim.
[00:55:25.515 --> 00:55:36.484]  And of course the formula that I developed myself, that's the super cuck beta male that everyone should be taking so we can get our orders from Hillary and know that she wears the pants around here.
[00:55:38.186 --> 00:55:45.152]  Everybody knows that for many years I played a satirical right-wing character, okay?
[00:55:45.592 --> 00:55:52.058]  This happened to me all the time when I played my right-wing character, talk radio host Tuck Buckford.
[00:55:55.896 --> 00:56:00.358]  I had the story about lizard penises and I was gonna go to it next.
[00:56:01.298 --> 00:56:02.938]  I needed the lizard penis story.
[00:56:04.239 --> 00:56:06.260]  Reprint me the lizard penis story.
[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:08.200]  Alright, don't hold out on me.
[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:10.921]  I don't care how long this takes, they may miss the news live.
[00:56:11.221 --> 00:56:12.562]  Alright, good.
[00:56:14.022 --> 00:56:17.003]  I'm Tuck Bugford here at the InfoWars Studios.
[00:56:17.704 --> 00:56:18.304]  Give it to them, man.
[00:56:20.234 --> 00:56:24.836]  I gave it to them, and I said, I need these images.
[00:56:25.176 --> 00:56:29.478]  You're welcome to look at the lizard penis all you want.
[00:56:30.058 --> 00:56:30.578]  Yogurt!
[00:56:31.178 --> 00:56:34.159]  You can look, you can look, you can look, you can look, you can look.
[00:56:34.599 --> 00:56:38.121]  You can look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.
[00:56:38.381 --> 00:56:40.702]  Now, I want to explain something.
[00:56:41.762 --> 00:56:44.723]  Alex Jones stole my identity as Tuck Buckford.
[00:56:45.323 --> 00:56:49.065]  And then Stephen Colbert, who I went to high school with, he stole it back.
[00:56:50.353 --> 00:56:50.793]  Thank you, sir.
[00:56:53.195 --> 00:56:54.516]  Now, I want the one that says, good luck, Charms.
[00:56:54.536 --> 00:56:56.038]  I need the one I had.
[00:56:56.058 --> 00:56:58.559]  In fact, I need that story or it's not good luck.
[00:56:59.220 --> 00:56:59.800]  You sure about that?
[00:57:00.301 --> 00:57:00.821]  I found it!
[00:57:01.402 --> 00:57:04.144]  Ah, you're right, it was in here, dude, but oh, not the one I wanted.
[00:57:08.547 --> 00:57:10.169]  Okay, you guys are really messing me up.
[00:57:10.825 --> 00:57:18.547]  And of course, did you think this manly man would lie to you about the theft of the lizard penises and the SWAT team raids?
[00:57:18.647 --> 00:57:18.887]  No.
[00:57:19.307 --> 00:57:20.188]  It's a real story.
[00:57:20.268 --> 00:57:21.328]  I'm not Alex Jones.
[00:57:21.608 --> 00:57:23.288]  I tell you real news.
[00:57:23.548 --> 00:57:24.269]  Tuck Buckford.
[00:57:24.609 --> 00:57:26.089]  Don't visit InfoWars.com.
[00:57:34.244 --> 00:57:36.226]  Well, that is it for the news tonight.
[00:57:36.286 --> 00:57:40.510]  So remember guys, we will see you tomorrow, Thursday, 7 p.m.
[00:57:40.570 --> 00:57:42.973]  Central for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:57:51.147 --> 00:58:00.709]  Did you know that only six corporations control 90% of what millions of Americans see, hear, and read every single day?
[00:58:01.169 --> 00:58:02.889]  It's the illusion of choice.
[00:58:03.069 --> 00:58:03.630]  Think about it.
[00:58:03.830 --> 00:58:09.611]  The mainstream media is owned by only a handful of megacorporations with vested interests.
[00:58:09.871 --> 00:58:15.472]  But on the other hand, the Internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources.
[00:58:15.832 --> 00:58:20.093]  So you can research information for yourself from multiple sources,
[00:58:20.593 --> 00:58:27.578]  Or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media, never questioning what you are being told.
[00:58:27.858 --> 00:58:30.620]  This gives you a false sense of reality.
[00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:33.302]  I mean, do you actually know what you think you know?
