[00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:13.142]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:13.162 --> 00:00:13.242]  Wow!
[00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.251]  I said it over and over and over again because it was common sense.
[00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:34.371]  It wasn't rocket science.
[00:00:35.192 --> 00:00:38.193]  The people still wanted to celebrate and think everything was A-OK.
[00:00:39.013 --> 00:00:49.577]  I made the point that Trump's victory was just the real signal of the civil war in this country to try to restore the republic and pull us out of the global system.
[00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:52.138]  That is absolute liquid tyranny.
[00:00:53.424 --> 00:00:55.785]  Total monopoly, total centralization of control.
[00:00:56.145 --> 00:00:58.666]  That is the globalist technocratic model in their own words.
[00:00:59.246 --> 00:01:01.607]  And now you're seeing all hell break loose.
[00:01:02.327 --> 00:01:15.311]  The FBI ordered all their different agents and minions, because Obama ordered them, to spy on everything that trumps appointees in waiting.
[00:01:16.345 --> 00:01:16.825]  We're doing.
[00:01:17.245 --> 00:01:21.447]  And it's admitted that this is all normal standard transition stuff that went on.
[00:01:21.467 --> 00:01:32.371]  It's totally normal for the President, Vice President, and other people like the National Security Advisor, as they are the interim period, to be reaching out when the President is President-elect.
[00:01:32.891 --> 00:01:37.453]  The media knows this, but they are acting like it's a huge, giant, big deal.
[00:01:38.916 --> 00:01:46.883]  Think about it, Hillary met not once but twice secretly with Putin when she was at the State Department, while meeting with the Russian head of state secretly.
[00:01:47.443 --> 00:01:52.608]  Well, quite frankly, the head of the State Department, if it's under the President's directive, can absolutely do that.
[00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:05.759]  The point is, you can't just sit there then and project onto Trump that, why he even wants to have a summit with the Russians, why the President even thinks he can talk to a foreign leader, why that's never been done before.
[00:02:06.844 --> 00:02:07.825]  This is 100% standard.
[00:02:07.845 --> 00:02:17.313]  And Flynn has done an interview, Daily Caller picked it up, as he was outgoing, saying, look, I apologize if I didn't remember every total thing when they said we want to talk about sanctions.
[00:02:17.613 --> 00:02:18.934]  And I said, OK, we'll get it set up.
[00:02:18.994 --> 00:02:20.476]  But we didn't talk about sanctions.
[00:02:20.756 --> 00:02:22.738]  They said they wanted to talk to the president about sanctions.
[00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:25.040]  And that's being recorded?
[00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:38.172]  That's totally and completely normal to do that, but again, the media, like when he fired the Attorney General, the Interim Attorney General, for insubordination, the media was like, the Monday Night Massacre.
[00:02:38.572 --> 00:02:41.494]  Never before has a president done something like this.
[00:02:41.874 --> 00:02:43.055]  Dun, dun, dun!
[00:02:43.195 --> 00:02:46.116]  Next, Donald Trump breathes air into his lungs.
[00:02:48.858 --> 00:02:52.760]  And Michael Moore knows he has moron viewers and moron constituents.
[00:02:53.801 --> 00:02:55.122]  Michael Moore calls for Hillary,
[00:02:56.007 --> 00:02:59.549]  To be installed as president once Trump arrested.
[00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:03.170]  And that's basically the mouth of the Democratic Party right there.
[00:03:04.231 --> 00:03:09.053]  Infowars.com, far left filmmaker in deranged Facebook rant.
[00:03:09.093 --> 00:03:10.334]  Well, that's his plan.
[00:03:10.814 --> 00:03:12.875]  Meanwhile, our Clifford Cunningham has an article about it.
[00:03:12.935 --> 00:03:14.956]  Michael Moore claims Trump is a Russian.
[00:03:16.212 --> 00:03:21.035]  And he tweets and Facebooks, I bet it was Trump told him, talk to the Russians.
[00:03:21.115 --> 00:03:22.355]  Dun, dun, dun!
[00:03:22.816 --> 00:03:29.159]  Yes, on December 15th, Flynn made more than 30 phone calls to counterparts and head ambassadors to countries.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.781]  And talk to them like you're supposed to do.
[00:03:32.181 --> 00:03:34.843]  Getting lined up phone calls with the president-elect.
[00:03:35.223 --> 00:03:36.323]  Dun, dun, dun!
[00:03:36.664 --> 00:03:42.487]  And then Trump would release transcripts of his phone calls with the other leaders, the prime ministers and others.
[00:03:42.547 --> 00:03:43.587]  Dun, dun, dun!
[00:03:44.881 --> 00:03:56.431]  Oh my gosh, when have you ever seen a president or a national security advisor on the phone with foreign diplomats talking about making deals?
[00:03:57.952 --> 00:04:01.094]  That is the 100% purview of a president.
[00:04:01.155 --> 00:04:05.138]  The president, because we elected him, could sign a treaty with Russia.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.142]  Basically doing anything, but Congress has to ratify it.
[00:04:12.734 --> 00:04:19.499]  I mean, that's how Obama did all these things, like carbon tax treaties and open border treaties and TPP treaties.
[00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.160]  And Trump got in and said, Congress never ratified that.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.621]  I'm shooting that baby down.
[00:04:24.142 --> 00:04:30.666]  Obama could meet dozens and dozens of times with foreign leaders in a treaty Hillary helped secretly write called the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:04:31.126 --> 00:04:33.548]  And then the public and Congress couldn't even learn about it.
[00:04:33.568 --> 00:04:36.110]  It was the president's purview of the executive.
[00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:43.556]  Look, you don't even have to know what the president said in all these secret meetings with foreign corporations, because that's the executive purview.
[00:04:45.257 --> 00:04:47.039]  Okay, Congress, you can't even see it.
[00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:48.140]  Remember all that?
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.422]  Meanwhile, Trump goes, yeah, get calls going to talk to the Russians.
[00:04:51.442 --> 00:04:51.903]  Yes, sir.
[00:04:52.303 --> 00:04:53.064]  Oh, my God!
[00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:54.165]  They talked to the Russians!
[00:04:54.185 --> 00:04:56.907]  We told you they were Russian agents!
[00:04:57.507 --> 00:04:58.248]  It's horrible!
[00:04:58.288 --> 00:04:59.169]  They're taking over!
[00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:01.291]  They're trying to make America great again!
[00:05:01.531 --> 00:05:01.711]  No!
[00:05:07.603 --> 00:05:07.763]  Ms.
[00:05:07.803 --> 00:05:13.288]  Farber is an American print journalist and author, an investigative reporter based in New York City and Sweden.
[00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:26.600]  And she was an early critic of the political correctness in all forms and has covered a range of topics from magazines including Spin, Rolling Stone, Esquire, Harper's, Interview, Salon, Gear, New York Press, Media Post, The New York Post, and Sunday Herald.
[00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:32.825]  The stories that are happening in Sweden, very often I find out about them, first of all, on InfoWars.
[00:05:33.285 --> 00:05:35.167]  I go to the grocery store, I see the
[00:05:35.467 --> 00:05:38.149]  There's a freshly minted folk hero.
[00:06:02.163 --> 00:06:06.427]  And I'm going to go ahead and call him a folk hero, even though he's also an anti-hero.
[00:06:06.467 --> 00:06:07.688]  He's also under attack.
[00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:09.569]  And you've reported on him.
[00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:13.392]  His name is Peter Springer in Swedish.
[00:06:13.472 --> 00:06:20.918]  He's a policeman and investigator, criminal investigator, in a city called Ã–rebro.
[00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:22.420]  Happened to be the city I grew up in.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.545]  And he posted a Facebook post that seems to be the turning point for the
[00:06:29.065 --> 00:06:31.447]  They're calling it, some people are calling it the Swedish Spring.
[00:06:31.467 --> 00:06:36.650]  I think he posted it on February 3rd, and the words have become iconic.
[00:06:37.491 --> 00:06:45.516]  It's gotten translated in the West as, I'm so effing tired, but it's actually a bit softer in the original Swedish.
[00:06:45.556 --> 00:06:48.378]  Really, it's like saying, I'm so damn tired, right?
[00:06:48.718 --> 00:06:53.942]  So he says, I'm so damn tired, essentially, of having to lie.
[00:06:54.202 --> 00:06:58.145]  There are codes here in Sweden that preclude
[00:06:59.025 --> 00:07:06.310]  Police investigators from indicating the ethnicity of the people perpetrating the crimes.
[00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:06.930]  Poor religion.
[00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:13.675]  In fact, it was in the news last year that they've told the Swedes, don't report Muslim crimes, basically, or don't put it in the database that it was Muslims.
[00:07:14.015 --> 00:07:16.577]  And they just say, oh, look, Swedish men are raping more women.
[00:07:16.617 --> 00:07:19.059]  All of a sudden, it's up 1,000% the last 10 years.
[00:07:19.079 --> 00:07:20.119]  Well, it's not Swedish men.
[00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:24.642]  Here's how it comes across when you're here looking at a newspaper stand.
[00:07:25.063 --> 00:07:26.423]  It'll just say the crime.
[00:07:27.524 --> 00:07:30.926]  And the faces are always pixelated.
[00:07:30.966 --> 00:07:33.988]  There's never any identifying factors whatsoever.
[00:07:34.028 --> 00:07:35.729]  So this isn't working for anybody.
[00:07:35.869 --> 00:07:41.493]  It's like a politically correct super experiment gone disastrous.
[00:07:41.533 --> 00:07:44.375]  They're creating racism.
[00:07:44.915 --> 00:07:47.957]  I don't think Swedish people are racist.
[00:07:48.017 --> 00:07:51.099]  Sure, but it's going to trigger survival mechanisms.
[00:07:51.579 --> 00:08:01.287]  When you turn on the news here and it's like, kill the whites, whites are inherently bad, and it's white people running it, there's clearly a plan, and it's to put people into racial groups for control.
[00:08:03.709 --> 00:08:04.249]  We've got it.
[00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:10.755]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:08:10.815 --> 00:08:12.896]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:15.178 --> 00:08:20.883]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:08:25.482 --> 00:08:29.185]  Undoubtedly, my plate has never been fuller, and the news has never been more important.
[00:08:30.146 --> 00:08:37.112]  This country is in the middle of a developing civil war that is economic and political.
[00:08:41.876 --> 00:08:51.805]  There is a civil war going on within the intelligence agencies, within the federal agencies, within the government in general, within corporations, and within our own neighborhoods, and cities, and states.
[00:08:55.954 --> 00:09:05.738]  All across the world, nationalist movements are all ahead in the polls in every major election to pull out of globalism.
[00:09:06.738 --> 00:09:21.284]  Globalist viceroys have been basically installed or force-fed through the media into office all over the globe, and the public is awakening in explosive fashion to this.
[00:09:22.853 --> 00:09:35.865]  The technocrats, the megabanks, the monopoly men are in full panic but have decided with bravado and chutzpah and arrogance and complete hubris to intensify their operations.
[00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:44.532]  Something big happened today and I'm going to be covering it at the bottom of the hour.
[00:09:44.592 --> 00:09:45.013]  It's huge.
[00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:56.556]  Remember a few years ago, we covered Jade Helm, when the military openly admitted they were training to occupy and dominate, quote, the human domain overseas or here.
[00:09:57.017 --> 00:09:57.958]  I'm not against the military.
[00:09:57.998 --> 00:10:10.187]  I'm against our military being prepared for martial law, while the Democratic Party tried to prepare the civil unrest that would bring in the martial law, and then a suspension of our basic rights, a suspension of the free press.
[00:10:11.188 --> 00:10:16.573]  All of that, since I first warned of Jade Helm two and a half years ago, has now basically come to pass.
[00:10:17.898 --> 00:10:19.740]  They've admitted they want to censor the press.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.402]  They admit they want an overthrow of our institutions.
[00:10:22.422 --> 00:10:37.274]  They admit they want a socialist-globalist reorganization or reconstruction or Marshall Plan in the West to fully break our will and complete our journey into centralized technocracy.
[00:10:37.754 --> 00:10:41.697]  Corporate fascism on the top, communism and socialism on the bottom to control us.
[00:10:42.898 --> 00:10:43.799]  That is the global model.
[00:10:46.127 --> 00:10:52.391]  And now The Intercept, and now Reuters, and now Zero Hedge.
[00:10:53.151 --> 00:11:06.919]  Why they all have gone and gotten the latest army documents that just got released from planning a year ago, where the military's been told, prepare to take over every town, every city, and the entire culture, because the United States is going to collapse.
[00:11:07.579 --> 00:11:10.481]  Exactly what I told you the plan was.
[00:11:11.397 --> 00:11:12.077]  Precisely.
[00:11:12.478 --> 00:11:26.726]  Now the media got so freaked out, Intel and globalist operators got upset because we had their plan decoded, reverse engineered, that they came out and said, oh Jones says they're going to invade in August of 2015 and take over Texas and take your guns.
[00:11:27.026 --> 00:11:27.647]  I never said that.
[00:11:28.067 --> 00:11:30.568]  But to discredit us, they created the straw man.
[00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:37.633]  The straw man to then be able to say, oh look, Alex said that Texas would be invaded.
[00:11:37.673 --> 00:11:38.273]  It never happened.
[00:11:39.781 --> 00:11:43.404]  Or Alex hates the military and says they want to kill their own citizens.
[00:11:44.445 --> 00:11:49.831]  I had some military people walk with me on the street and they go, Alex, I just really like you, but how dare you say we want to take the guns and kill everybody?
[00:11:49.851 --> 00:11:52.613]  And I said, are you not training for gun confiscation?
[00:11:53.234 --> 00:11:55.176]  Are you not being ordered these drills and maneuvers?
[00:11:55.456 --> 00:11:57.137]  Well, we just like to, you know, the training.
[00:11:57.177 --> 00:11:58.639]  Well, we'll never follow those illegal orders.
[00:11:59.099 --> 00:12:01.562]  Oh, so I am right that you're being trained for that.
[00:12:02.022 --> 00:12:03.724]  Some of these were officers down the street.
[00:12:03.744 --> 00:12:04.765]  One of them was a colonel on the street.
[00:12:05.663 --> 00:12:07.805]  I said, listen, I'm not blaming you for any of this.
[00:12:07.865 --> 00:12:08.726]  I'm trying to stop it.
[00:12:09.046 --> 00:12:09.607]  I'm a citizen.
[00:12:09.627 --> 00:12:10.347]  That's what I'm supposed to do.
[00:12:10.908 --> 00:12:12.809]  But that's how they spun it as a PSYOP.
[00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:16.333]  Coming up later in the hour, I'm going to break it down because it's all come out now.
[00:12:16.673 --> 00:12:24.560]  Pentagon warns in their own reports of unfavorable dystopian future for world's biggest cities.
[00:12:27.422 --> 00:12:28.944]  Now that's the intercepts angle.
[00:12:30.325 --> 00:12:33.327]  But when you read it, it's for total takeover of society to stop that.
[00:12:33.407 --> 00:12:35.028]  Coming soon to a Senior U, the U.S.
[00:12:35.068 --> 00:12:36.828]  military plans to take over America.
[00:12:37.349 --> 00:12:37.929]  That's what it says.
[00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:48.194]  I mean, Obama's Rural Commission said they're going to run especially the small towns where they believe there's going to be resistors to gun confiscation.
[00:12:48.475 --> 00:12:51.016]  Oh, but that's just in the Army videos, the Army documents.
[00:12:51.136 --> 00:12:56.579]  I'm just the guy, document him, shot please for TV viewers, that walked over to the shelf today and pulled this off the shelf.
[00:12:57.199 --> 00:12:58.540]  Oh, the Jade Helm folder.
[00:13:00.922 --> 00:13:03.986]  And everything we wrote, everything we said, all documented, now being admitted.
[00:13:04.286 --> 00:13:04.466]  Why?
[00:13:04.526 --> 00:13:09.452]  Because we had it from leaks, we had it from pieces of documents, and we had it from our deep research.
[00:13:10.334 --> 00:13:12.817]  And now it's exactly what we said.
[00:13:12.837 --> 00:13:18.003]  The New York Times spun it all.
[00:13:18.083 --> 00:13:20.446]  Jones said they were going to take over, but it didn't happen.
[00:13:23.413 --> 00:13:24.074]  See how they do it?
[00:13:24.854 --> 00:13:26.655]  And now, a few years later, oh!
[00:13:27.776 --> 00:13:30.078]  Pentagon training videos, open admission.
[00:13:30.818 --> 00:13:35.301]  Society's gonna collapse, the military's gonna be in every town and city to make sure it doesn't.
[00:13:35.762 --> 00:13:37.963]  Now, if we had a real collapse or something, that'd be fine.
[00:13:38.384 --> 00:13:49.672]  The issue is it's being engineered to then bring in the military, who the citizens trust, to then establish the tyranny, and then the bureaucrats come behind them.
[00:13:49.972 --> 00:13:51.353]  That's how it always worked.
[00:13:52.588 --> 00:13:56.631]  When the Communists took over Russia in 1917, it took them two years to just get Moscow under full control.
[00:13:56.931 --> 00:14:06.319]  Then they ordered the military to go out and to have the local provincial leaders hand in their firearms and announce that they would serve under the Bolshevik Communist system.
[00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:10.622]  And because it was the military everybody knew, and it was a lot of them were their families, they said absolutely.
[00:14:10.863 --> 00:14:17.588]  They turned their guns in, the military went back, tens of thousands of officers, more than 20,000 in one year, were all arrested, tortured, and executed.
[00:14:18.729 --> 00:14:19.910]  Now the Bolsheviks came back,
[00:14:21.271 --> 00:14:23.332]  With the weapons and the reign of terror began.
[00:14:23.352 --> 00:14:25.774]  This is a program!
[00:14:25.814 --> 00:14:33.019]  You have to understand that the same big banks in New York and London ran that whole operation in Russia.
[00:14:33.059 --> 00:14:34.140]  That's a historical fact!
[00:14:38.963 --> 00:14:44.807]  That was even in the Public Affairs Washington Post piece about how the Kremlin is starting to worry about Trump.
[00:14:45.819 --> 00:14:53.845]  And it said in there, boy, I bet Germany wishes it wouldn't have let the Bolsheviks come through Germany into Russia, because when they overthrew that, the Bolsheviks tried to overthrow them.
[00:14:54.546 --> 00:14:56.688]  And this revolution is going to overthrow everything.
[00:14:57.028 --> 00:15:02.172]  So Trump's not a Bolshevik, he's a patriot, but we all need to stop him because this contagion is too dangerous.
[00:15:02.592 --> 00:15:03.593]  Wow, sophisticated.
[00:15:03.833 --> 00:15:11.359]  And what they're really saying is, we'll back off and pull our shadow armies out, our Soros operatives out, Russia, if you help us burn Trump.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.321]  Because he's a threat to us all.
[00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:27.060]  So, the same globalist grandchildren, the grandchildren of the people that did this to Russia and Germany and other places, are now set to carve this country up like a big old Christmas hog.
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:31.725]  And it's up to all of us to be smart enough to understand what's happening, but here it is!
[00:15:32.606 --> 00:15:39.492]  In all the big super respected journals, the Intercept, Greenwald, oh, The Guardian, all of them,
[00:15:40.501 --> 00:15:45.886]  But I mean, back at the time, it's like Obama signs commission, rural affairs with the Pentagon over all the small towns.
[00:15:46.526 --> 00:15:49.129]  Then I went and looked at the actual manuals and then they leaked some of them.
[00:15:49.949 --> 00:16:01.019]  And the Pentagon said, yeah, those are real manuals that Alex Jones has, where it was talking about rounding us up with social security numbers and processing the men into one area and the kids into another and the women another and taking the troublemakers to re-education camps.
[00:16:01.319 --> 00:16:05.243]  And it used the term re-education camp, which is a Soviet term.
[00:16:07.363 --> 00:16:10.444]  And then the media said, Jones says we'll be in re-education camps this summer.
[00:16:10.824 --> 00:16:11.504]  I said, no I didn't.
[00:16:11.844 --> 00:16:12.184]  No I didn't.
[00:16:12.424 --> 00:16:14.265]  I said, here's, see, that's, and you watch.
[00:16:14.585 --> 00:16:16.105]  They'll do it again today, probably.
[00:16:16.465 --> 00:16:18.406]  Jones says that we'll be under martial law.
[00:16:18.706 --> 00:16:21.066]  Well, actually, if Michael Moore has his way, we're about to be.
[00:16:21.407 --> 00:16:22.987]  Oh, see how we're maneuvered into that.
[00:16:23.427 --> 00:16:29.749]  I've been warning the whole time so the military and the police and people understand and are decompartmentalized to see the big picture.
[00:16:30.269 --> 00:16:31.769]  And yes, I know what I'm talking about.
[00:16:32.089 --> 00:16:33.950]  And yes, I don't just have my own research.
[00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:34.990]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:16:38.843 --> 00:16:52.614]  And a lot of good people in our government made the decision that they did not want to be part of completely destroying this country, and then literally ending the free press as we know it, and bringing in the long, dark night of tyranny.
[00:16:53.054 --> 00:16:58.198]  But that's where this country is, and that's why they had planned to get Hillary Clinton into power.
[00:16:58.638 --> 00:17:05.584]  They'd already put out a book that came out in January, already written a year ago, about global government under Bill and Melinda Gates, led by
[00:17:06.684 --> 00:17:13.048]  Hillary Clinton, and you guessed it, Bill and Melinda Gates, for a world government to, quote, promise free health care.
[00:17:13.368 --> 00:17:13.768]  That's right.
[00:17:14.129 --> 00:17:19.812]  World government's going to give you the promise of free Bill and Melinda Gates vaccines, always completely tainted.
[00:17:20.132 --> 00:17:21.193]  Here it is.
[00:17:21.273 --> 00:17:22.413]  Governing global health.
[00:17:22.694 --> 00:17:29.017]  And the news is asking today, weeks after we covered it, why is no one covering this book about global government?
[00:17:30.098 --> 00:17:32.720]  Because they admit it failed.
[00:17:33.945 --> 00:17:44.635]  And now the whole plan to have Hillary and Oprah Winfrey and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation lead a worldwide plan for sterilization, forced inoculation, you name it.
[00:17:45.015 --> 00:17:46.937]  But, oh, we're not a military, even though we have guns.
[00:17:47.177 --> 00:17:47.917]  We're here to help.
[00:17:48.198 --> 00:17:50.740]  We're the new global health corps.
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.301]  Oh, isn't that sweet?
[00:17:53.222 --> 00:17:54.924]  Tyranny coming to skies as doctors.
[00:17:56.058 --> 00:17:58.540]  Nobody's talking about Chelsea Clinton's new book, including Chelsea Clinton.
[00:17:58.841 --> 00:18:00.482]  The Heat Street asked, why is that?
[00:18:01.223 --> 00:18:03.545]  Because we blew their operation.
[00:18:03.585 --> 00:18:04.406]  And that's the good news.
[00:18:04.846 --> 00:18:16.637]  Trump has put them in such disarray and exposed them and derailed programs that were already in so much trouble that he's already a fabulous, giant hero and it's historical.
[00:18:18.049 --> 00:18:37.361]  There's a lot of paradoxes in this, because Goldman Sachs put every bit of money they had against him, but now their stock's at all-time highs, just like a bunch of other stocks are, because so much prosperity is now seen, and so many opportunities, but they wanted a managed economy where they made less money, but other people had less, so theirs was worth more, see?
[00:18:37.581 --> 00:18:38.402]  They want a monopoly.
[00:18:38.662 --> 00:18:40.103]  They don't want everybody to have a rising tide.
[00:18:41.263 --> 00:18:54.290]  So they're still working against him even though the policies he's brought in created such a bump in the stock market that their ship got risen the most because they're already gaming it with high-frequency trading and already skimming off the top.
[00:18:54.770 --> 00:19:03.055]  So the little guys all got something but the big fat cat got even more but it's all up there pissed with hundreds of billions of dollars they just made in the last few months.
[00:19:03.075 --> 00:19:05.916]  That's admitted Associated Press still gunning for Trump.
[00:19:05.936 --> 00:19:08.858]  Because see, they don't want you to have
[00:19:10.598 --> 00:19:12.979]  A pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of.
[00:19:12.999 --> 00:19:13.939]  I'm going to skip this break.
[00:19:15.399 --> 00:19:17.160]  And they're all announcing they don't care.
[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:20.560]  The federal agencies are in total revolt.
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:24.341]  The FCC, the State Department, they say we're still going to shut down the new press.
[00:19:24.882 --> 00:19:33.824]  Trump's Twitter has been hijacked where they only let negative comments at the top so he can't even see them and can't see your communication to him because he'll retweet it or he'll read and see what you said.
[00:19:34.064 --> 00:19:35.184]  They know he's looking at Twitter.
[00:19:35.444 --> 00:19:37.125]  I mean, they've got him so isolated, folks.
[00:19:37.605 --> 00:19:38.525]  It's not even a news item.
[00:19:39.105 --> 00:19:40.486]  I even run a little news operation.
[00:19:40.506 --> 00:19:46.732]  I can't get any of the crew, even though they're aware of it, they're great people, to like make it a focus that the President's Twitter is being censored.
[00:19:48.053 --> 00:20:00.165]  There's a Trump, Netanyahu press conference going on right now, and I'm just not going to go to that because we know that he's pro-Israel, and we know that that just means that we're not going to, like the WikiLeaks showed with Soros, overthrow Israel.
[00:20:00.185 --> 00:20:04.809]  So that's a good thing because Israel's got nuclear weapons that could cause World War III, but we'll play parts of that later.
[00:20:09.505 --> 00:20:11.566]  Let me just read you some of these headlines, okay?
[00:20:11.586 --> 00:20:17.368]  Because, as I said, later in the hour, I already started getting into it, I'm gonna get into the Pentagon, openly admits plans to take over the United States.
[00:20:17.729 --> 00:20:21.210]  That doesn't mean they're coming next week, it doesn't mean they're bad, it doesn't mean they're gonna slit our throats.
[00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:27.313]  They've been ordered to get ready for collapse, as the good guys, while the globalists create the collapse, you understand?
[00:20:27.833 --> 00:20:36.277]  Then once the military's come in, and once that's been normalized, then all the spooks, and all the control, and all the rest of the garbage happens, and I'm not stupid.
[00:20:37.157 --> 00:20:59.461]  I know why the military the last three years has been reaching out and wanting to come on and oh we're just patriots that just happen to show up where you're at and I told people I go I know you've been encouraged to come and be friends with the show and I understand you are a friend that's why you were chosen and I don't mind having you guys you know close here with your CIA orders but let's just be clear it's so I can tell you what's going on not because I don't know what's going on.
[00:21:01.246 --> 00:21:12.830]  And it's happening because they had a press conference three years ago, we covered it, I'm going to get into that, at the Pentagon saying, we promised to stop lying, the public doesn't trust us, we've been ordered to lie but we're going to stop now.
[00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:19.593]  But we are going to go and infiltrate, I mean move into every local town, every media outlet, to help work with America to stabilize it.
[00:21:20.113 --> 00:21:25.575]  And these guys all believe that side of their mission, while the whole Soros side is to undermine it and bring it all down.
[00:21:26.255 --> 00:21:30.198]  So, it's a sophisticated situation, but don't think I don't see the whole thing.
[00:21:30.818 --> 00:21:32.880]  Okay, let's continue.
[00:21:36.502 --> 00:21:51.833]  Don't think I don't know that I have to worry about the globalists and Soros, but also have to worry about the RNC and the Republicans that know that Infowars pushed Trump over the edge with populism here, and that we're a powerful engine of resistance, so the main threat to my life is the Republican leadership.
[00:21:53.851 --> 00:21:54.992]  Just like Trump says at this time.
[00:21:55.673 --> 00:22:04.240]  They're just going to use left cover with all the comedians and more and the rest of them saying, kill Trump, kill Trump, and organizing the overthrow.
[00:22:05.261 --> 00:22:09.265]  That's how crazy this whole situation is and how close to the edge we are.
[00:22:10.421 --> 00:22:37.906]  So if you don't want tax cuts, if you don't want to secure our borders, if you don't want to bring back a trillion dollars that's been in big mega banks they won't bring in, if you don't want to kill NAFTA and GATT and all these scams and one-sided trade deals, and if you want to have a weak military and you want to be pathetic and you want to have folks running the government that are absolutely out to get you and your family and dominate you and who don't want prosperity, if you want monopolies, then everybody, whether you're liberal or conservative, go ahead and get on board with that scumbag lunatic Michael Moore and Nancy Pelosi and the rest of them.
[00:22:40.003 --> 00:22:47.707]  And all the media tarts that say they want to open the borders to radical Islam, but they don't ever want to go to Somalia and get gang raped or sold on a slave block.
[00:22:52.029 --> 00:22:54.771]  Michael Moore calls for Hillary to be installed.
[00:22:54.831 --> 00:22:55.611]  Told you that was coming.
[00:22:57.092 --> 00:22:58.733]  Oh, the conspiracy theorist is right again.
[00:22:58.753 --> 00:22:59.873]  I'm not a conspiracy theorist.
[00:22:59.953 --> 00:23:00.734]  I'm on target.
[00:23:01.594 --> 00:23:05.016]  Michael Moore calls for Hillary to be installed as president once Trump arrested.
[00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:08.331]  I told you they'd beat that drum months ago.
[00:23:08.371 --> 00:23:09.192]  I laid it all out.
[00:23:09.552 --> 00:23:22.542]  And I said if Trump ever balks and ever cuts one of his people, thinking they'll give him a sacrificial lamb, there'll be blood in the water, and they'll say everybody's a Russian, and everybody's got to be arrested, we've got to take over the media and shut down the free press because the Russians are everywhere.
[00:23:22.983 --> 00:23:29.728]  And now, in the Netherlands, Walters is in the lead, and so they're saying he must be Russian, the nationalist for 20 years over there.
[00:23:30.048 --> 00:23:30.969]  And the same thing with Le Pen.
[00:23:30.989 --> 00:23:31.549]  She's in the lead.
[00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:34.031]  The Muslims are burning cities down everywhere.
[00:23:34.051 --> 00:23:35.092]  They won't even call it Muslims.
[00:23:35.112 --> 00:23:37.013]  They say anti-police riots.
[00:23:40.875 --> 00:23:42.276]  So everywhere it's the Russians.
[00:23:42.296 --> 00:23:43.516]  The Italians want sovereignty.
[00:23:43.596 --> 00:23:44.557]  Oh, it's the Russians!
[00:23:45.598 --> 00:23:51.681]  The magical... You know, you don't find a leprechaun at the end of a rainbow in a pot of gold.
[00:23:51.741 --> 00:23:52.902]  You find the Russians.
[00:23:53.502 --> 00:23:55.303]  Political solid gold.
[00:23:55.943 --> 00:23:56.784]  Unstoppable.
[00:23:57.024 --> 00:23:57.684]  Invincible.
[00:23:57.844 --> 00:23:58.545]  Impenetrable.
[00:23:59.554 --> 00:24:02.135]  The Russians, ladies and gentlemen, cooked my eggs this morning.
[00:24:02.855 --> 00:24:03.635]  They cooked my bacon.
[00:24:04.656 --> 00:24:11.918]  And it's embarrassing to say, they helped me put my boots on, they helped me clean my nose and brush my teeth, and wash my butt.
[00:24:12.979 --> 00:24:14.079]  I'm just going to be honest at this point.
[00:24:15.079 --> 00:24:18.321]  I have an American flag behind me because I'm actually a Russkie, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:18.861 --> 00:24:19.781]  Now let's continue here.
[00:24:20.281 --> 00:24:27.644]  Michael Moore, an admitted globalist agent, calls for Hillary to be installed as president once Trump arrested.
[00:24:28.979 --> 00:24:32.981]  Infowars.com, far-left filmmaker in deranged Facebook rant.
[00:24:35.163 --> 00:24:40.886]  He goes on to say, Flynn was told to talk to the Russians.
[00:24:40.926 --> 00:24:42.567]  He knows his viewers are complete idiots.
[00:24:42.607 --> 00:24:49.431]  They're like, the President's man, the National Security Advisor, talked to the Russians?
[00:24:51.112 --> 00:24:58.577]  Remember, Hillary went and negotiated TPP in secret, helped write it, gave speeches, wouldn't let Congress see it, and they said it's executive purview of the President.
[00:24:59.551 --> 00:25:09.118]  The president could go meet with the Chinese president, the Russian president, if he could politically survive the heat, but under the law, for a week behind closed doors if they wanted to.
[00:25:09.358 --> 00:25:10.959]  That's why you elect a head of state.
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:14.701]  But you can't even trust that commander-in-chief now.
[00:25:14.741 --> 00:25:15.342]  He's a Russian.
[00:25:15.522 --> 00:25:16.783]  There's the headline right here.
[00:25:17.463 --> 00:25:19.585]  Michael Moore claims Trump a Russian.
[00:25:19.865 --> 00:25:21.126]  Well, if he is, we need more like him.
[00:25:21.646 --> 00:25:24.228]  Thank God the Russians want to make America great again.
[00:25:26.394 --> 00:25:29.875]  Now you think about that, and let me tell you what Trump needs to do right now.
[00:25:30.835 --> 00:25:32.896]  Trump's saying, hey, we need to arrest these leakers.
[00:25:32.936 --> 00:25:33.856]  What they did was illegal.
[00:25:33.876 --> 00:25:37.817]  You know, what Flynn did wasn't illegal, but I'm getting rid of them for not remembering everything.
[00:25:38.577 --> 00:25:44.559]  But let me tell you, this is illegal, how we're being spied on and how it's being given to the media, and that's a felony.
[00:25:44.779 --> 00:25:45.739]  And Congress admits that.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.160]  That's not strong enough, bro.
[00:25:48.362 --> 00:25:54.708]  We're putting out a report today that has all the mainstream articles, with the Chinese government, the Saudi Arabians, the Pope, everybody.
[00:25:55.348 --> 00:26:03.295]  It was their saying, they were giving money to Hillary, they were against Hillary, I mean against Trump, they were trying to prop her up.
[00:26:03.916 --> 00:26:11.343]  They were doing all this garbage, a hundred times what the Russians could ever do, and Saudi princes were bragging that they gave money.
[00:26:12.546 --> 00:26:14.067]  20% to Hillary.
[00:26:14.487 --> 00:26:15.648]  Where is Trump on this?
[00:26:16.188 --> 00:26:18.189]  Where is Trump saying, you Democrats are crazy?
[00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:22.331]  This is completely out of control.
[00:26:23.431 --> 00:26:30.755]  The leakers who exposed General Flynn, ladies and gentlemen, even leftist publications are having to admit, absolutely committed felony crimes.
[00:26:34.124 --> 00:26:37.947]  Now they're saying Flynn may face felony charges for lying to the FBI.
[00:26:38.528 --> 00:26:42.611]  Because the FBI came to him, they were already recording him, and had access to the NSA.
[00:26:44.432 --> 00:26:45.533]  They said, you talk about sanctions.
[00:26:45.653 --> 00:26:48.395]  No, we talked about setting up a meeting with the President over the phone.
[00:26:49.136 --> 00:26:57.483]  But the Russians mentioned, we want to talk about this on the agenda, and Flynn said, I can't talk about that, but I'm sure the President wants a clean slate so that can be discussed.
[00:26:58.383 --> 00:27:00.065]  So, technically he did, technically he didn't.
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:02.881]  Trump's commenting on Flynn leaks now.
[00:27:02.901 --> 00:27:03.641]  Let's back this up.
[00:27:03.681 --> 00:27:04.321]  It's live right now.
[00:27:04.341 --> 00:27:04.781]  Let's go to it.
[00:27:04.801 --> 00:27:05.081]  Here it is.
[00:27:07.822 --> 00:27:10.503]  Michael Flynn, General Flynn, is a wonderful man.
[00:27:10.523 --> 00:27:14.084]  I think he's been treated very, very unfairly by the media.
[00:27:16.005 --> 00:27:18.366]  As I call it, the fake media in many cases.
[00:27:19.486 --> 00:27:23.347]  And I think it's really a sad thing that he was treated so badly.
[00:27:23.967 --> 00:27:27.749]  I think in addition to that, from intelligence,
[00:27:29.471 --> 00:27:31.431]  Papers are being leaked, things are being leaked.
[00:27:32.572 --> 00:27:34.212]  It's criminal action, criminal act.
[00:27:35.292 --> 00:27:37.773]  And it's been going on for a long time, before me.
[00:27:38.893 --> 00:27:40.354]  But now it's really going on.
[00:27:41.554 --> 00:27:48.916]  And people are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton.
[00:27:49.616 --> 00:27:58.218]  I think it's very, very unfair what's happened to General Flynn, the way he was treated, and the documents and papers that were illegally
[00:27:58.996 --> 00:27:59.736]  I stress that.
[00:27:59.897 --> 00:28:00.757]  Illegally leaked.
[00:28:01.658 --> 00:28:02.578]  Very, very unfair.
[00:28:03.399 --> 00:28:06.861]  As far as settlements, I'd like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit.
[00:28:08.041 --> 00:28:09.843]  We'll work something out.
[00:28:09.943 --> 00:28:11.984]  But I would like to see a deal be made.
[00:28:12.044 --> 00:28:13.265]  I think a deal will be made.
[00:28:13.905 --> 00:28:16.026]  I know that every president would like to.
[00:28:16.106 --> 00:28:20.249]  Most of them have not started till late because they never thought it was possible.
[00:28:21.289 --> 00:28:23.891]  And it wasn't possible because they didn't do it.
[00:28:24.792 --> 00:28:26.873]  But Bibi and I have known each other a long time.
[00:28:27.816 --> 00:28:31.959]  A smart man, great negotiator, and I think we're going to make a deal.
[00:28:32.339 --> 00:28:35.481]  It might be a bigger and better deal than people in this room even understand.
[00:28:36.101 --> 00:28:37.142]  That's a possibility.
[00:28:38.142 --> 00:28:39.083]  So let's see what we do.
[00:28:39.103 --> 00:28:43.126]  Let's try it.
[00:28:43.266 --> 00:28:48.089]  Doesn't sound too optimistic, but that's a good negotiator.
[00:28:48.129 --> 00:28:49.069]  That's the art of the deal.
[00:28:52.446 --> 00:28:53.687]  I also want to thank Sarah.
[00:28:53.707 --> 00:28:54.648]  Could you please stand up?
[00:28:54.808 --> 00:28:57.010]  You're so lovely and you've been so nice to Melania.
[00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:58.271]  I appreciate it very much.
[00:29:02.254 --> 00:29:03.155]  All about family with Trump.
[00:29:03.715 --> 00:29:05.677]  Okay, this is... Let's back this up.
[00:29:06.558 --> 00:29:08.179]  Was that from the start of the Flynn comment?
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.942]  Okay, so we caught it at the start.
[00:29:10.982 --> 00:29:12.423]  Okay, good job guys.
[00:29:13.003 --> 00:29:14.425]  Talk about on target.
[00:29:14.445 --> 00:29:15.886]  Let's go back to the press conference as we go out to break.
[00:29:16.496 --> 00:29:27.012]  Mr. President, in your vision for the new Middle East peace, are you ready to give up the notion of two-state solution that was adopted by previous administration?
[00:29:27.842 --> 00:29:36.445]  And will you be willing to hear different ideas from the Prime Minister and some of his partners that are asking him to do, for example, annexation of parts of the West Bank?
[00:29:36.625 --> 00:29:39.246]  Alright folks, we can pause here and come back with the answer.
[00:29:39.466 --> 00:29:42.408]  But I'm going to get into the really big picture and break down exactly what's going on.
[00:29:42.428 --> 00:29:43.768]  There's a war to bring down Trump.
[00:29:43.788 --> 00:29:44.228]  You already know it.
[00:29:44.248 --> 00:29:44.808]  It's declared.
[00:29:45.249 --> 00:29:46.009]  I know how to stop it.
[00:29:46.089 --> 00:29:46.769]  We can stop it.
[00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:49.290]  Trump must go on the offensive big time.
[00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:50.711]  We're going to supply the ammo.
[00:29:50.731 --> 00:29:51.171]  Stay with us.
[00:29:52.714 --> 00:29:55.701]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.643 --> 00:29:59.329]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.311 --> 00:30:08.435]  The military industrial complex is trying to sabotage Donald Trump.
[00:30:08.595 --> 00:30:12.697]  Last night, National Security Advisor Michael Flynn officially resigned.
[00:30:12.737 --> 00:30:17.901]  This following reports that he had misled officials about his contacts with Russia.
[00:30:17.961 --> 00:30:25.086]  Meanwhile, the establishment media says this validates their conspiracy theory that Russia hacked the U.S.
[00:30:25.166 --> 00:30:25.626]  elections.
[00:30:25.766 --> 00:30:32.070]  They're also claiming that General Flynn's conversation with the Russian ambassador is a violation of the Logan Act.
[00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:32.931]  But wait a minute.
[00:30:33.251 --> 00:30:36.713]  Where was the mainstream media during the Bilderberg conferences?
[00:30:36.913 --> 00:30:46.539]  You know, the secret group of global elitists ignored by the mainstream media as they privately meet each year to plan and coordinate global policy.
[00:30:46.839 --> 00:30:55.784]  Look, the establishment wants to purge the Trump administration and replace them with compromised Washington insiders and globalists.
[00:30:55.904 --> 00:30:59.066]  In other words, they are trying to refill the swamp.
[00:30:59.366 --> 00:31:01.788]  You can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:31:03.493 --> 00:31:05.314]  I'm going to lay it out short and sweet.
[00:31:06.995 --> 00:31:12.658]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[00:31:13.379 --> 00:31:17.261]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[00:31:18.231 --> 00:31:20.414]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[00:31:20.434 --> 00:31:21.676]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[00:31:21.716 --> 00:31:24.920]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[00:31:25.901 --> 00:31:26.222]  Or more.
[00:31:26.322 --> 00:31:28.225]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[00:31:28.765 --> 00:31:30.247]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[00:31:30.327 --> 00:31:33.692]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[00:31:33.792 --> 00:31:35.574]  It's actually scary.
[00:31:36.431 --> 00:31:46.518]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[00:31:47.518 --> 00:32:00.327]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support Infowars in our fight to promote human liberty and freedom.
[00:32:03.291 --> 00:32:09.444]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[00:32:10.006 --> 00:32:11.429]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[00:32:12.321 --> 00:32:14.223]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[00:32:14.803 --> 00:32:20.367]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[00:32:20.948 --> 00:32:28.934]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[00:32:28.954 --> 00:32:31.416]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[00:32:31.716 --> 00:32:35.939]  This is the best system out there, and we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[00:32:36.199 --> 00:32:36.940]  This is how it works.
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:37.741]  You order.
[00:32:37.881 --> 00:32:38.661]  Customized or
[00:32:39.742 --> 00:32:41.203]  Straight from the factory, however you want it.
[00:32:41.704 --> 00:32:44.846]  It is shipped on the next business day to you and your family.
[00:32:45.166 --> 00:32:49.209]  And a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this republic.
[00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:50.210]  You cannot lose.
[00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:51.331]  You're funding the Infowar.
[00:32:51.651 --> 00:32:58.396]  You're getting the highest quality product, the most tested, the most durable, the most certified, the most believed in.
[00:32:58.737 --> 00:33:02.660]  You need to have this true piece of America ready in minutes.
[00:33:05.629 --> 00:33:07.731]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:08.252 --> 00:33:13.437]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:19.884 --> 00:33:28.313]  It's time to escape from the New World Order.
[00:33:31.169 --> 00:33:40.779]  I'm going to get into Jade Helm here in about 10 minutes and I'm going to play a little piece we put together years ago just showing how the government is arming against the people, trying to take on gun owners, veterans, patriots.
[00:33:41.559 --> 00:33:42.821]  Almost all the funding was for that.
[00:33:42.981 --> 00:33:48.747]  Trump ended with an executive order, the Extremism Project, for anybody but radical Islam.
[00:33:49.485 --> 00:33:54.908]  He said, no longer is this for the militias and the gun owners and the veterans and the Christians, claiming they're the big threat in America.
[00:33:54.988 --> 00:33:56.508]  It's radical Islam.
[00:33:57.089 --> 00:34:01.371]  100% of the extremist program in the federal government will now be targeting them.
[00:34:02.131 --> 00:34:02.912]  That was two weeks ago.
[00:34:04.132 --> 00:34:05.713]  Another one of the incredible things Trump's done.
[00:34:05.733 --> 00:34:11.636]  I'm always trying to list all the good things he's done, just being in, you know, what is it, three and a half weeks now or a month?
[00:34:12.376 --> 00:34:13.177]  It's just amazing.
[00:34:14.097 --> 00:34:15.738]  It really is that incredible.
[00:34:17.142 --> 00:34:19.844]  And that's why the power structure is doing everything it can to stop him.
[00:34:22.026 --> 00:34:28.711]  So again, every time we expose that the military is training for collapse, the media says, oh you hate the military, oh you made it up.
[00:34:28.731 --> 00:34:35.096]  And they never mention that we're showing you army.mil documents, declassified documents, leaked documents, you name it.
[00:34:35.616 --> 00:34:36.036]  But now,
[00:34:37.145 --> 00:34:44.432]  That Trump's in, they've released a bunch of stuff that Obama was doing the last year and a half, and it is really, really, really bad news.
[00:34:45.012 --> 00:34:45.793]  Super bad news.
[00:34:46.514 --> 00:35:01.828]  And it's in the Intercept, and it's in other mainstream news, because it's just documents they're linked to, saying they're preparing for total collapse, and believe that it is going to take place, and that it is going to happen.
[00:35:04.218 --> 00:35:05.199]  We're not saying that.
[00:35:05.339 --> 00:35:09.641]  And again, the globalists are bringing in policies for civil unrest and financial collapse.
[00:35:09.861 --> 00:35:15.563]  They were hoping to do it once Hillary got in and use the global crises and global health crises to bring in world government.
[00:35:16.064 --> 00:35:25.208]  Chelsea even wrote a book intending that her mother would win that she's not promoting now about how she would lead a global health initiative with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to force all this tyranny on us.
[00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:29.810]  I told you about the book a few weeks ago.
[00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:33.292]  Now it's in the news that she failed in her world government plan.
[00:35:35.199 --> 00:35:36.940]  The book's called Governing Global Health.
[00:35:39.141 --> 00:35:41.122]  So, that's how big these stakes are.
[00:35:42.743 --> 00:35:51.807]  And some people, you know, send me articles, they go, well look, Goldman Sachs stocks up 30-something percent this year since Trump got in and, you know, you say they're against him.
[00:35:52.067 --> 00:35:52.447]  Well, why?
[00:35:52.827 --> 00:35:53.928]  The whole stock market's up.
[00:35:54.861 --> 00:35:56.002]  Two plus trillion dollars.
[00:35:56.743 --> 00:35:59.787]  They've made a couple hundred billion of that because they pretty much run Wall Street.
[00:36:00.128 --> 00:36:08.758]  But now little firms are making money, and Trump's trying to get the Federal Reserve to make loans at almost zero percent interest to small businesses, and Yellen's in the news.
[00:36:08.778 --> 00:36:10.380]  He's about to get rid of her in the next week.
[00:36:11.081 --> 00:36:14.063]  That's why they're so pissed, saying it's not wise to not raise interest rates.
[00:36:14.083 --> 00:36:15.024]  We need to raise them more.
[00:36:15.824 --> 00:36:22.188]  Oh, you wanted it at zero when the big banks were hoarding all the money for themselves and using it, and then loaning it out at loan sharking rates.
[00:36:22.549 --> 00:36:23.669]  No, no, no, Cupcake.
[00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:27.212]  Trump's gonna send it out at zero percent interest, or close to it.
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:34.382]  So again, Trump is so good for business that they are exploding.
[00:36:34.802 --> 00:36:36.663]  And their stockholders are getting even richer.
[00:36:36.863 --> 00:36:38.003]  But that's not what they want.
[00:36:38.123 --> 00:36:40.464]  They want you in 200 square foot coffin apartments.
[00:36:40.724 --> 00:36:42.345]  They want you so poor they run your life.
[00:36:42.365 --> 00:36:44.186]  They do not want you to have the wealth.
[00:36:44.506 --> 00:36:47.607]  That's real wealth is when everybody else is poor and you've got the only wealth.
[00:36:48.208 --> 00:36:52.149]  That's the greatest form of wicked centralized wealth there is.
[00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:53.090]  That's evil wealth.
[00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:55.011]  Monopoly wealth.
[00:36:55.919 --> 00:37:13.752]  Christ beat the money changers, because they were priests who were really about money, and they made you buy the sacrifice, whenever you were going to have sacrifice at the temple, with a certain coin that was rare, that only they controlled, and they'd make you pay five, ten times what the coin was worth of silver, to exchange it.
[00:37:13.852 --> 00:37:14.772]  It was money changing.
[00:37:14.792 --> 00:37:15.873]  It was money manipulation.
[00:37:17.014 --> 00:37:19.055]  To be able to go in and have your sacrifice to God.
[00:37:19.596 --> 00:37:22.558]  And he went in with a whip, and overturned the tables, and beat them.
[00:37:25.114 --> 00:37:27.157]  You can read the different versions of the gospel, they're all the same.
[00:37:27.377 --> 00:37:28.799]  He beat them up.
[00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:32.405]  He physically attacked them and kicked a bunch of their butts.
[00:37:32.425 --> 00:37:34.708]  Don't you know Christ could fight if he wanted to?
[00:37:34.988 --> 00:37:39.895]  He said, this is where I reserve physical attacks, is for people that pull crap like this.
[00:37:41.656 --> 00:37:43.417]  You get all the money, nobody else does.
[00:37:43.717 --> 00:37:45.318]  You get all the wealth, nobody else does.
[00:37:45.578 --> 00:37:49.880]  And then you sit up there and play class envy, and go, see that person making $250,000 a year?
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:50.400]  They're in the 1%.
[00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:53.581]  Yeah, if you make a quarter million dollars a year, you're in the 1%, folks.
[00:37:54.422 --> 00:37:57.103]  They say 1% has like 60-70% of the wealth, depending on how you look at it.
[00:37:57.483 --> 00:37:58.904]  Some metrics are 80%.
[00:38:00.725 --> 00:38:01.425]  We've done the math.
[00:38:01.505 --> 00:38:02.545]  It's 11 zeros.
[00:38:03.426 --> 00:38:04.066]  And then what, 4-2?
[00:38:04.106 --> 00:38:05.787]  Depending on how you do the equation.
[00:38:07.947 --> 00:38:12.229]  Yeah, there's less than 20 people in the world that have more than half the wealth.
[00:38:12.449 --> 00:38:12.830]  That's right.
[00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:21.514]  But all this 1%, those are the people that have a house and a pool, so you've got an entry-level job to come clean the pool, or so you can own a company that does clean pools.
[00:38:22.795 --> 00:38:26.877]  Or so you can have a company that cuts the grass, or have a salon, or have a restaurant.
[00:38:27.097 --> 00:38:28.258]  That's called an economy.
[00:38:28.478 --> 00:38:30.399]  You want a big, rich, middle class.
[00:38:32.577 --> 00:38:33.138]  No!
[00:38:33.818 --> 00:38:38.884]  We've got to raise taxes on the 1% because the globalists are offshore and tax-exempt.
[00:38:39.224 --> 00:38:39.745]  They love it.
[00:38:39.785 --> 00:38:41.546]  They want to get rid of the middle class.
[00:38:41.586 --> 00:38:47.913]  And don't worry, 30 plus percent of the middle class is gone in just the last 40 years, and it's going away even faster.
[00:38:47.953 --> 00:38:49.435]  So don't worry.
[00:38:51.036 --> 00:38:54.100]  They'll probably have their way and bankrupt everybody except themselves.
[00:38:55.970 --> 00:39:01.332]  And I just love the mental midgets out there that go, he's got three members of Goldman Sachs in his deal.
[00:39:01.452 --> 00:39:02.032]  Absolutely.
[00:39:02.472 --> 00:39:04.533]  All of them fought NAFTA and GATT and globalism.
[00:39:04.973 --> 00:39:07.014]  All of them have fought against this whole operation.
[00:39:07.654 --> 00:39:11.455]  And all of them have pointed out that zero money came from Goldman Sachs to Trump.
[00:39:11.915 --> 00:39:13.236]  It all went to Hitler.
[00:39:14.996 --> 00:39:16.657]  Because she was the one that was supposed to win.
[00:39:17.177 --> 00:39:18.438]  And they did steal five states.
[00:39:18.478 --> 00:39:19.618]  They tried to steal six others.
[00:39:19.938 --> 00:39:25.440]  But the landslide was so big that all their fake polls and all their bull couldn't put their fraud back together again.
[00:39:33.063 --> 00:39:43.172]  Remember, I said first it'll be, oh, we just want to see if the Russians were involved, and oh, then the Russians were involved, and oh, the American people didn't vote for Trump, it was the Russians, and oh, did you talk to the Russians during the campaign?
[00:39:44.133 --> 00:39:49.398]  Oh, did you talk to them during transition, which they admit's all normal, then they call it espionage and call for everyone's arrest.
[00:39:51.181 --> 00:39:59.150]  And suddenly you see all the big neocon and rhino republicans getting up on Fox News all sticking their chest out going, Mr. Trump needs to come for us.
[00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:00.771]  We're gonna find out.
[00:40:01.052 --> 00:40:04.395]  Lindsey Graham's gonna run the show and so's John McCain.
[00:40:05.497 --> 00:40:07.519]  We're not gonna let Rooskies run America.
[00:40:09.295 --> 00:40:23.743]  The very Republicans that helped run the whole Islamic Jihad with Obama the last six years, turning North Africa, Eastern Africa, Central Asia, the Middle East, over to radical Islam, killing hundreds and hundreds of thousands in Syria alone.
[00:40:24.664 --> 00:40:25.364]  Millions total.
[00:40:26.645 --> 00:40:28.246]  Islam spreading everywhere.
[00:40:28.426 --> 00:40:29.307]  The borders open.
[00:40:31.288 --> 00:40:38.472]  Mosques opening in places like Greece that haven't had mosques in hundreds of years because they were under the Ottomans for hundreds of years, conquered by the Muslims.
[00:40:42.162 --> 00:40:46.965]  And then America decided to promote the West and not commit suicide, and Europe struggled to not commit suicide.
[00:40:48.026 --> 00:40:49.807]  Politically, culturally, spiritually.
[00:40:51.528 --> 00:41:07.678]  And the globalists, the Michael Moores, the Nancy Pelosi's, the Maxine Waters of the world, they just sit up there on arrogant power trips because they know the big banks are behind them, they know the big media is behind them, and they're arrogant and they think they're unstoppable and they are just on a war path.
[00:41:08.138 --> 00:41:12.560]  Against the middle class and the bitter clingers and gun owners and Christians and veterans and everybody else.
[00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:15.401]  And they want to have a big civil war and a destabilization.
[00:41:15.621 --> 00:41:21.323]  And then they want to have the military they hate the most march in and have a big shooting war with gun owners.
[00:41:21.563 --> 00:41:30.246]  And out of that civil war, they'll sit back and basically, you know, cook hot dogs and schmores and marshmallows over the fire of our republic.
[00:41:30.466 --> 00:41:31.806]  Well, I got news for you.
[00:41:31.866 --> 00:41:33.607]  I want to stop that fire from happening.
[00:41:33.807 --> 00:41:36.168]  But if it does, it's going to be you going into it.
[00:41:37.679 --> 00:41:38.019]  Idiots.
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:47.382]  You might be able to assassinate Trump or start a civil war, but believe me, you're gonna lose real fast, within hours.
[00:41:48.762 --> 00:41:53.943]  The patriots in our government have made a list, like Santa Claus does, of who's naughty and who's nice.
[00:41:54.644 --> 00:41:56.064]  And so, good luck.
[00:41:57.264 --> 00:42:06.947]  But I know, Pelosi's so dumb, she thinks Bush is still in office, and Waters thinks that Russia invaded with Trump, with his support, Korea,
[00:42:09.298 --> 00:42:10.718]  And they're just so stupid.
[00:42:12.679 --> 00:42:21.041]  Just like Zuckerberg thought he could just take hundreds of acres of people's land bordering his in Hawaii, which was ancestral ritual land, and people wouldn't blow up in his face.
[00:42:21.341 --> 00:42:22.182]  He's like, I'm a liberal!
[00:42:22.502 --> 00:42:23.122]  I'm a liberal!
[00:42:23.542 --> 00:42:26.363]  I fund cop-killing organizations like Black Lives Matter.
[00:42:26.383 --> 00:42:27.583]  Can't I just have your property?
[00:42:27.603 --> 00:42:28.963]  I mean, I'm a god!
[00:42:29.043 --> 00:42:29.384]  Look at me!
[00:42:29.424 --> 00:42:33.425]  I'm a little know-it-all, total sociopath, psychopath, control freak.
[00:42:33.685 --> 00:42:34.345]  Bow down to me.
[00:42:36.846 --> 00:42:37.846]  It didn't work, did it?
[00:42:39.795 --> 00:42:47.064]  And must not know much about the Hawaiians at this point if he actually tries to take their land, how safe he'd be when he was in Kauai.
[00:42:49.987 --> 00:42:55.033]  He wants their actual 2,000-year-old ritual grounds?
[00:42:55.614 --> 00:42:57.777]  He's like, well, it's a beautiful plateau up here.
[00:42:57.857 --> 00:42:59.199]  Yeah, it sure is, bro.
[00:43:01.693 --> 00:43:04.035]  It shows the total error, the opposite of what you call liberal.
[00:43:04.175 --> 00:43:08.238]  It's like Apple with suicide nets around their factories, forced drugging, all of it.
[00:43:08.459 --> 00:43:10.640]  The Chinese selling their political dissidents organs.
[00:43:10.881 --> 00:43:14.464]  And the liberals are like, I hope the Chinese communists can help stop Trump.
[00:43:14.724 --> 00:43:16.866]  And they're at Davos saying, we will stop Trump.
[00:43:16.886 --> 00:43:20.088]  And I'm going to say this to the president, and I'm getting to the other news.
[00:43:20.128 --> 00:43:20.689]  Mr. President.
[00:43:21.741 --> 00:43:23.582]  And all his constituents have to get this message to Trump.
[00:43:24.043 --> 00:43:31.488]  The communist Chinese went to Davos and the president, the elected president said, we're going to stop Trump and we're going to stop America and the globalists.
[00:43:31.768 --> 00:43:42.696]  That's the espionage and the governmental leaders from the Democrats that were there, they should all, you should all start calling for their investigation and they all did it in public and guaranteed it's all recorded.
[00:43:42.716 --> 00:43:48.840]  Of course, I know Trump actually knows this, so they're kind of keeping this as a nuclear option.
[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:49.081]  No!
[00:43:50.233 --> 00:43:52.095]  Hillary is a communist Chinese agent.
[00:43:52.295 --> 00:43:53.536]  She is an agent of the Saudis.
[00:43:54.697 --> 00:43:55.277]  And I'm done.
[00:43:57.139 --> 00:44:00.322]  These people were openly involved in our election, up one side and down the other.
[00:44:00.482 --> 00:44:09.089]  And then they want to tell all of us that want our Second Amendment and our property rights and our veterans taken care of, and we don't want to be under Obamacare, we want to have our taxes cut, that I'm a Russian agent?
[00:44:09.269 --> 00:44:11.651]  You can go straight back to Hades where you came from.
[00:44:11.671 --> 00:44:16.555]  Oh man, I'm getting angry.
[00:44:17.196 --> 00:44:18.117]  I'm going to cover it all, but...
[00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:26.573]  I knew when I saw that yesterday that Spicer was going further than he was supposed to in knocking Flynn.
[00:44:27.634 --> 00:44:29.975]  That's why you saw Trump come out and say how great Flynn is today.
[00:44:29.995 --> 00:44:37.238]  And that is Trump delegating to his politicos and they stab him in the back every time.
[00:44:39.246 --> 00:44:42.607]  And it's been coming out in the news, Priebus is the one, one of the big leakers.
[00:44:42.847 --> 00:44:45.708]  There's an article on Infowars.com by Dr. Corsi that needs to go viral.
[00:44:46.508 --> 00:44:59.513]  We've got a lot of exclusive sources of what's exactly going on in the White House, and the type of horrible ambassadorships that Priebus is handing out to people that will then be used to burn Trump, saying he's putting bad people in these positions.
[00:45:01.433 --> 00:45:05.775]  And again, the President has pardoning power.
[00:45:07.247 --> 00:45:12.654]  He doesn't need to pardon himself or Flynn for communicating with the Russians.
[00:45:12.694 --> 00:45:14.397]  That's what the president does.
[00:45:15.919 --> 00:45:20.445]  Again, Hillary tried to negotiate TPP and did, in secret, over years.
[00:45:23.208 --> 00:45:25.289]  And it was totally secret from Congress and the American people.
[00:45:25.569 --> 00:45:26.769]  That violates the Logan Act.
[00:45:26.989 --> 00:45:27.610]  That's illegal.
[00:45:27.730 --> 00:45:28.850]  That's private corporate meetings.
[00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:35.673]  But if you don't think national security advisors talk to Russian ambassadors, what do you think security advisors and ambassadors do?
[00:45:35.733 --> 00:45:36.793]  It's called diplomacy.
[00:45:37.013 --> 00:45:37.734]  It's what they do.
[00:45:37.974 --> 00:45:46.517]  But the liberal constituency is so uneducated, so uninformed, so low information, that they just are screaming and yelling about Russian plots.
[00:45:47.057 --> 00:45:56.860]  Meanwhile, we have footage on Infowars.com of John Bowne of the local communist group protesting a cat shelter that's been vandalized repeatedly and telling people to F off.
[00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:01.561]  And locals going, well, what's wrong with communists?
[00:46:03.502 --> 00:46:04.902]  They haven't ever done anything wrong.
[00:46:06.002 --> 00:46:07.443]  The communism is right here.
[00:46:07.783 --> 00:46:10.764]  The communism that took over Russia came from New York and London.
[00:46:11.064 --> 00:46:11.924]  That's a historical fact.
[00:46:14.485 --> 00:46:15.585]  It's John Bowne's report.
[00:46:18.803 --> 00:46:23.045]  I think we should rename it and put it back out as the most disgusting commies you've ever seen discovered.
[00:46:23.905 --> 00:46:27.407]  Or, you know, commies besieging cat shelter.
[00:46:27.607 --> 00:46:28.347]  Unbelievable video.
[00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:37.752]  Cat shelters had windows knocked out, stuff spray-painted, superglue put in the keyholes.
[00:46:38.814 --> 00:46:41.256]  And they're saying it's gentrification because there's a cat shelter.
[00:46:41.996 --> 00:46:49.142]  Meanwhile, when South by Southwest comes in and they have big parties and bulldoze people's houses and whatever, they all love it because the Red Brigades run out of the University of Texas.
[00:46:50.863 --> 00:46:51.783]  Oh yeah, it's unbelievable.
[00:46:51.803 --> 00:46:56.427]  Because they want to divert everybody from the real gentrification stuff that's going on.
[00:46:56.527 --> 00:46:58.588]  I mean, you talk about the scum of the earth.
[00:46:58.949 --> 00:47:03.312]  These are people that literally attack women and people in wheelchairs.
[00:47:06.621 --> 00:47:19.470]  And they are just literally, I mean, imagine if you're such scum that you go out and you attack people's cat sanctuaries.
[00:47:20.731 --> 00:47:25.455]  And then the local liberals are so Stockholm-centered, we talk to them and they're like, oh, I agree, yes, this is good.
[00:47:26.391 --> 00:47:34.576]  And then they walk over to a beautiful Hispanic, she looks Hispanic, looks like a model, and she's beautiful, so they tell her, get the hell out of here, scum!
[00:47:34.857 --> 00:47:39.300]  Because the thing is, they're mainly white kids, they don't like anybody that looks good or is successful.
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:41.021]  What it is, is a loser club.
[00:47:41.281 --> 00:47:54.930]  We're losers, we're ugly, we're stupid, 90% of us live in our mother's basements, we are scum of the earth, most of us are on heroin, they admit that, and so we're just totally unhappy people, so we go pick a cat sanctuary, because that sounds like what a low-level demon would do.
[00:47:57.017 --> 00:48:02.721]  I'm going to come back with the big news straight ahead and more of what we need to do to stop all this, what's happening in the economy, and so much more.
[00:48:04.002 --> 00:48:14.410]  But before I do, I am now announcing undoubtedly what I believe will be the best-selling product in InfoWars life history in our award-winning, cutting-edge, game-changing supplements.
[00:48:15.991 --> 00:48:16.792]  And that's Caveman.
[00:48:17.733 --> 00:48:23.437]  We've been using this already for months before it officially came out, and it is unbelievable.
[00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:35.139]  Ladies and gentlemen, they know for a fact that humans' sea-sized brain began to grow when humans began to scavenge bones and then cook them and eat the marrow and grind the bones down.
[00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:41.606]  At all ancient human sites, what you find is that humans were mainly scavengers for meat, hunter-gatherers for berries and things like that.
[00:48:42.767 --> 00:48:44.328]  Then our brains grew and got larger.
[00:48:45.662 --> 00:48:47.543]  And we became more successful because of that.
[00:48:47.583 --> 00:48:49.124]  I've got a whole stack of news right here.
[00:48:49.144 --> 00:48:50.384]  This is the Daily Mail.
[00:48:50.424 --> 00:48:56.106]  How modern humans have become weaklings compared with our ancient ancestors who could outrun and outlive today's top athletes.
[00:48:57.467 --> 00:49:07.751]  Just the average, the average, you know, Irish farmer or African farmer, they've done people up, was twice as strong.
[00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:11.290]  Ten thousand years ago, as we are now.
[00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:12.490]  What happened?
[00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:19.553]  I mean, men just three generations ago, everybody knows, were more aggressive, more virile, on average.
[00:49:21.935 --> 00:49:23.855]  So, what's happening?
[00:49:25.236 --> 00:49:26.116]  What's unfolding here?
[00:49:26.216 --> 00:49:27.217]  Well, the big thing is,
[00:49:28.737 --> 00:49:32.518]  Grandma always told you, if you want to be strong, you want to get better, have oxtail soup or bone soup.
[00:49:32.538 --> 00:49:33.159]  Everybody knows that.
[00:49:33.179 --> 00:49:34.939]  That's the big, hot thing in the NFL for years.
[00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:36.420]  And power lifters.
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:38.100]  But I thought, why do that?
[00:49:38.541 --> 00:49:42.362]  Why not have the ultimate, this is the ultimate, there's nothing even close, of
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:51.205]  The condensed essence out of the bones and a whole bunch of other superfoods and nutrients to totally turbocharge.
[00:49:51.225 --> 00:49:53.427]  We've given this to top athletes, top weightlifters.
[00:49:53.447 --> 00:49:54.488]  We're going to have endorsing it soon.
[00:49:54.869 --> 00:50:01.054]  And they were just like, we've never had anything this good for joint pain, the tissues of the body.
[00:50:01.574 --> 00:50:02.956]  Caveman is simply.
[00:50:04.113 --> 00:50:05.434]  The absolute game changer.
[00:50:05.494 --> 00:50:07.655]  It's a giant container of it.
[00:50:07.675 --> 00:50:07.655]  $39.95.
[00:50:08.255 --> 00:50:11.077]  It's a massive discount out of the gates.
[00:50:11.857 --> 00:50:13.998]  33% off because I want everybody to try it.
[00:50:14.018 --> 00:50:22.482]  I want everybody to actually get it for themselves because there's nothing like Caveman in my experience.
[00:50:23.543 --> 00:50:28.566]  And again, it's the essence of the bones, the bone marrow.
[00:50:29.602 --> 00:50:30.003]  All of it.
[00:50:30.584 --> 00:50:34.470]  It's up to collagen that is essential for ligaments, muscles, tendons.
[00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:35.912]  And I'm going to skip this break.
[00:50:35.953 --> 00:50:37.155]  I just have to tell you more about Caveman.
[00:50:38.176 --> 00:50:40.039]  Let me just read to you from the write-up about it.
[00:50:41.132 --> 00:50:48.034]  Our modern society has lost virtually all of its ancient traditions and practices that our ancestors so greatly valued for thousands of years.
[00:50:48.634 --> 00:50:54.676]  One such practice goes all the way back to the dawn of man, cooking meat over a fire and simmering down the bones into the broth.
[00:50:55.216 --> 00:50:56.496]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[00:50:56.516 --> 00:51:05.159]  For thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed it in every culture, its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk, just like grinding up bones and then putting it into bread.
[00:51:05.859 --> 00:51:09.162]  Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman.
[00:51:09.762 --> 00:51:13.044]  Be he live or be he dead, I'll grind his bones to make my bread.
[00:51:13.425 --> 00:51:15.386]  Thus the 600-year-old Jack and the Beanstalk.
[00:51:15.406 --> 00:51:16.827]  That was when it was first written down, probably older.
[00:51:18.669 --> 00:51:25.153]  But again, then you'd also take the stuff in the hearth and burn what was left of the bones in the hearth and the potash, then use that on your crops.
[00:51:25.634 --> 00:51:32.119]  So this is next level with the vitamins, the nutrients, the trace elements, the minerals.
[00:51:33.168 --> 00:51:36.490]  Today we call it bone broth, but this is like bone broth to the next level.
[00:51:36.810 --> 00:51:43.494]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost on modern diets and processed junk.
[00:51:44.515 --> 00:51:54.981]  Introducing Caveman Infowars Life, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, everybody knows what that does, turmeric, chaga mushroom, and seven
[00:51:56.328 --> 00:51:59.731]  Total Primal Superfoods in a Single Great Tasting Formula.
[00:52:00.231 --> 00:52:07.917]  The unique formulation behind Caveman combines cutting-edge nutraceutical science and ancient nutrition to increase potency and maximum benefits.
[00:52:09.238 --> 00:52:17.083]  High-quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle at the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[00:52:17.904 --> 00:52:22.848]  Collagen works, again, to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue life essence.
[00:52:24.295 --> 00:52:30.539]  These are just a few of the superfood ingredients found in the new Caveman True Paleo Formula, now exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.

[00:52:37.844 --> 00:52:38.685]  Why does a dog...
[00:52:40.023 --> 00:52:43.966]  Ignore the meat and go for the guts, the tendons, and the bones.
[00:52:44.426 --> 00:52:49.810]  Well, guts have the meal of whatever it was eating, and the guts have all the flora and the bacteria.
[00:52:50.410 --> 00:52:52.251]  It's kind of gross, but it's like yogurt to them.
[00:52:52.932 --> 00:52:56.294]  Okay, but it's not quite, you know, the normal kind of yogurt we want.
[00:52:57.355 --> 00:52:59.476]  And then they start eating the meat after that.
[00:53:00.977 --> 00:53:02.739]  The red meat that tastes good, that we all love,
[00:53:03.777 --> 00:53:07.619]  That's the least nutritious, when it comes to just calories and everything else.
[00:53:07.639 --> 00:53:15.083]  They go for the fat, they go for the guts, they go for something else in the digestive tract, because that's where it's all at.
[00:53:15.623 --> 00:53:16.024]  Wolves.
[00:53:17.299 --> 00:53:22.505]  The big cats, bears, all of them, when they go for meat, that's what they go for first.
[00:53:22.785 --> 00:53:24.427]  That's why a dog will sit there with a bone.
[00:53:25.007 --> 00:53:26.168]  They don't just like to chew it.
[00:53:26.208 --> 00:53:27.350]  They didn't just do it because it's fun.
[00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:29.352]  They're chewing in to eat the marrow.
[00:53:29.912 --> 00:53:36.079]  They want the marrow that grows the blood, that grows the white blood cells, that's got the stem cells in it.
[00:53:36.988 --> 00:53:42.231]  Now, this is all desiccated, but what we know is that that's what has the effect historically.
[00:53:42.591 --> 00:53:47.034]  And we went out and saw other formulas that are somewhat like this, and it was just a couple of dollars of stuff.
[00:53:47.054 --> 00:53:49.476]  Just grind up some bones, some filler, throw it in there.
[00:53:49.496 --> 00:53:50.056]  No, no, no, no.
[00:53:50.656 --> 00:53:53.158]  This cost us a lot to make, okay?
[00:53:53.858 --> 00:53:54.759]  A lot to make.
[00:53:55.839 --> 00:53:57.741]  Quite frankly, I'm like, man, this is expensive to make.
[00:53:57.761 --> 00:53:58.741]  We need to make some profits.
[00:53:59.422 --> 00:54:02.023]  But it's got markup in it as well to fund the operation.
[00:54:05.236 --> 00:54:07.600]  But you need to go check it out for yourself.
[00:54:08.161 --> 00:54:10.185]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:54:11.247 --> 00:54:14.012]  That's infowarsstore.com or call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[00:54:14.032 --> 00:54:15.374]  But whatever you do, don't just believe me.
[00:54:20.316 --> 00:54:32.646]  You know, a few months ago, the new Super Blue toothpaste with colloidal silver and nascent iodine came in that we have the biggest manufacturer in the country of organic, non-fluoride toothpaste that we had private-labeled for us, but do our own proprietary blend.
[00:54:33.567 --> 00:54:37.470]  And I took it home, a couple tubes, used it.
[00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:42.695]  A couple months later, I'm like, why am I digging around for toothpaste to find an old tube of, you know, Tom's of Maine, which is, you know, great stuff.
[00:54:43.495 --> 00:54:44.196]  And I realized, oh.
[00:54:46.064 --> 00:54:49.345]  Oh boy, yeah, I don't have auto ship because I bring it home.
[00:54:49.925 --> 00:54:56.326]  That's why everybody has to get on auto ship because you'll just forget and then you don't get the best toothpaste out there and you're not supporting the broadcast.
[00:54:56.627 --> 00:54:57.847]  It's a lose-lose, folks.
[00:54:58.347 --> 00:55:01.128]  It's great toothpaste and if you like it, then please sign up for auto ship.
[00:55:01.168 --> 00:55:02.088]  You can cancel anytime.
[00:55:02.388 --> 00:55:04.648]  That way you keep supporting the broadcast and you get great toothpaste.
[00:55:05.089 --> 00:55:05.649]  It's a win-win, 360 win.
[00:55:07.619 --> 00:55:08.340]  Well, it's the same thing.
[00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:11.984]  Now, one of my concerns was, I said, man, really concentrated bone broth?
[00:55:12.024 --> 00:55:12.664]  What's this gonna be like?
[00:55:13.065 --> 00:55:15.227]  Well, we have a natural way to make it really taste good.
[00:55:15.808 --> 00:55:17.489]  It goes really great with cocoa.
[00:55:18.831 --> 00:55:20.633]  And so, it tastes delicious.
[00:55:22.159 --> 00:55:26.622]  Because I remember when we first got the first formula, it tasted, you know, like bones.
[00:55:26.642 --> 00:55:31.726]  It kind of tasted good, but I'm a guy, you know, I like the taste of pretty serious stuff.
[00:55:31.746 --> 00:55:33.187]  I like the taste of aged beef, you name it.
[00:55:33.207 --> 00:55:34.988]  As you get older, you get a more complex palate.
[00:55:35.008 --> 00:55:35.989]  I wouldn't like that when I was a kid.
[00:55:36.649 --> 00:55:37.750]  And I said, we've got to do something.
[00:55:37.770 --> 00:55:43.895]  So we worked for this for about another six months, formulators, and it works great with cocoa, which is also good for you in an antioxidant.
[00:55:44.495 --> 00:55:45.416]  So it's chocolate flavor.
[00:55:46.657 --> 00:55:48.640]  So, ladies and gentlemen, get ready for this.
[00:55:49.141 --> 00:55:49.641]  Here it is right here.
[00:55:49.701 --> 00:55:51.324]  I personally like it over ice.
[00:55:51.364 --> 00:55:52.565]  They brought it to me without ice.
[00:55:56.370 --> 00:55:57.192]  But it's incredible.
[00:55:58.193 --> 00:55:59.354]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:56:00.319 --> 00:56:01.059]  But not as sweet.
[00:56:01.539 --> 00:56:03.640]  And I'm not saying that because I want to make it sound good.
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:04.561]  I love Ovaltine, folks.
[00:56:04.601 --> 00:56:08.842]  But it's, obviously, 30 years ago it was a good, you know, crappy thing for the kids.
[00:56:08.862 --> 00:56:10.123]  It had a little bit of vitamins in it.
[00:56:10.143 --> 00:56:10.923]  I'm not knocking Ovaltine.
[00:56:10.963 --> 00:56:12.204]  I still buy it occasionally.
[00:56:12.884 --> 00:56:15.185]  But I was like, this tastes like Ovaltine, but not as sweet.
[00:56:15.385 --> 00:56:18.406]  If you put a little bit of honey in this, or a little bit of sugar, it's Ovaltine.
[00:56:18.746 --> 00:56:19.506]  I mean, it's incredible.
[00:56:20.026 --> 00:56:23.568]  So, it's available right now on InfoWarsTore.com, or call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[00:56:27.675 --> 00:56:29.436]  888-253-3139.
[00:56:29.796 --> 00:56:34.278]  Now, before I go any further, I ran out of time to get into Jade Helm.
[00:56:35.679 --> 00:56:38.160]  Again, which is an entire lesson on how the globalists operate.
[00:56:39.681 --> 00:56:44.943]  We know there's military training, there's billions of bullets getting bought, the Justice Department admits they're trying to take on gun owners, veterans, conservatives.
[00:56:45.644 --> 00:56:46.684]  That's in all their manuals.
[00:56:47.004 --> 00:56:48.905]  How's the media tapped down this awakening?
[00:56:49.506 --> 00:56:53.347]  They go, Alex Jones says he hates the military, and they're coming to take Texans' guns and kill them.
[00:56:53.628 --> 00:56:54.088]  Never said that.
[00:56:54.755 --> 00:56:58.776]  They put it in thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of publications.
[00:56:58.796 --> 00:57:00.976]  I mean, sometimes it was thousands a week for years.
[00:57:01.657 --> 00:57:04.477]  Went from 2014 right to 2015.
[00:57:05.157 --> 00:57:11.459]  So they spent years attacking me, misrepresenting, so you'd accept the real takeover, because they want to get our military to accept it.
[00:57:12.059 --> 00:57:17.920]  And under Obama, this has now come out, and it's in mainstream news today, that they have a plan to quote, take over the United States.
[00:57:18.581 --> 00:57:23.822]  Now our military doesn't want to be part of this, but the globalists are fomenting civil unrest and the overthrow of Trump.
[00:57:24.588 --> 00:57:25.148]  To bring it in.
[00:57:25.428 --> 00:57:26.749]  They were already planning it with Hillary.
[00:57:27.309 --> 00:57:28.330]  And the takeover of the press.
[00:57:29.550 --> 00:57:31.111]  But now it's in the news.
[00:57:33.252 --> 00:57:34.072]  Mainstream news.
[00:57:34.612 --> 00:57:35.252]  Pentagon.
[00:57:35.713 --> 00:57:38.574]  Warns of unfavorable dystopian future for world's biggest cities.
[00:57:38.594 --> 00:57:41.095]  Believe they're going to have to occupy the United States.
[00:57:42.175 --> 00:57:43.476]  Coming soon to senior U.S.
[00:57:43.516 --> 00:57:45.457]  military plan to take over America.
[00:57:45.497 --> 00:57:46.017]  Zero hedge.
[00:57:46.317 --> 00:57:47.458]  And it's direct quotes.
[00:57:48.838 --> 00:57:50.739]  You understand exactly what I told you.
[00:57:53.646 --> 00:57:56.547]  Back in the article, government promises to stop lying because of Drudge Report.
[00:57:56.907 --> 00:58:00.028]  In their own press release, they said the military will be in every city in the U.S.
[00:58:00.228 --> 00:58:00.628]  from July 28, 2013.
[00:58:00.948 --> 00:58:05.690]  Go watch my breakdown of it, and the State Department breakdown of it.
[00:58:07.470 --> 00:58:08.330]  That's three years ago.
[00:58:09.791 --> 00:58:12.472]  Master of the human domain, the domestic plan behind Jade Helm.
[00:58:13.812 --> 00:58:18.914]  And they admit in their own words, control everything, surveil everything, for whoever's ordering them.
[00:58:18.934 --> 00:58:19.854]  And that would have been Hillary Clinton.
[00:58:21.733 --> 00:58:27.058]  Now they put this in and the State Department and other agencies are in open revolt against Trump.
[00:58:27.098 --> 00:58:27.899]  The military isn't.
[00:58:28.319 --> 00:58:29.760]  So there's a civil war in the country.
[00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:30.741]  Oh, here's another London Guardian.
[00:58:31.002 --> 00:58:33.264]  Revolution, flash mobs, brain chips, a grim future.
[00:58:33.504 --> 00:58:34.625]  That's their Ministry of Defense.
[00:58:35.466 --> 00:58:35.786]  You see?
[00:58:36.106 --> 00:58:36.827]  I told you.
[00:58:37.287 --> 00:58:38.348]  We don't lie, folks.
[00:58:38.388 --> 00:58:39.990]  We give you the absolute truth.
[00:58:40.669 --> 00:58:43.512]  Total truth, as best we can give it to you, as best we can find it.
[00:58:43.773 --> 00:58:44.373]  Are we perfect?
[00:58:44.414 --> 00:58:44.634]  No.
[00:58:45.495 --> 00:58:47.057]  I'll be honest, it's worse than I usually think.
[00:58:47.437 --> 00:58:52.183]  So I'm sorry that I don't say things are worse, because I just can't even get my mind around it.
[00:58:53.141 --> 00:58:58.265]  The military industrial complex is trying to sabotage Donald Trump.
[00:58:58.425 --> 00:59:02.527]  Last night, National Security Advisor Michael Flynn officially resigned.
[00:59:02.567 --> 00:59:07.731]  This following reports that he had misled officials about his contacts with Russia.
[00:59:07.791 --> 00:59:14.916]  Meanwhile, the establishment media says this validates their conspiracy theory that Russia hacked the U.S.
[00:59:14.976 --> 00:59:15.456]  elections.
[00:59:15.596 --> 00:59:21.880]  They're also claiming that General Flynn's conversation with the Russian ambassador is a violation of the Logan Act.
[00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:22.781]  But wait a minute.
[00:59:23.081 --> 00:59:26.524]  Where was the mainstream media during the Bilderberg conferences?
[00:59:26.744 --> 00:59:36.371]  You know, the secret group of global elitists ignored by the mainstream media as they privately meet each year to plan and coordinate global policy.
[00:59:36.651 --> 00:59:45.598]  Look, the establishment wants to purge the Trump administration and replace them with compromised Washington insiders and globalists.
[00:59:45.738 --> 00:59:48.900]  In other words, they are trying to refill the swamp.
[00:59:49.201 --> 00:59:51.462]  You can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:59:54.133 --> 00:59:58.254]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:58.754 --> 01:00:00.094]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:01.254 --> 01:00:08.395]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:08.676 --> 01:00:13.336]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:13.376 --> 01:00:20.738]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:00:23.516 --> 01:00:30.618]  Okay, coming up, we have been totally verified, certified, proven absolutely on target again, just a fact.
[01:00:33.899 --> 01:00:37.059]  In fact, it's about 200% right, because it's just way worse than we thought.
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:43.201]  The Pentagon's openly announced they've been ordered the last two years to prepare for total martial law, the takeover of every U.S.
[01:00:43.221 --> 01:00:45.121]  city, for total dystopian collapse.
[01:00:45.161 --> 01:00:45.681]  That's a quote.
[01:00:46.082 --> 01:00:51.503]  We have the Pentagon's own promotional video about the coming dystopian collapse in preparation for it, not just here, but worldwide.
[01:00:53.046 --> 01:00:56.787]  We told you the globalists are engineering a financial worldwide meltdown when they're ready.
[01:00:57.347 --> 01:01:01.528]  That's why people in intelligence agencies and others have been trying to block this because it's so horrible.
[01:01:02.889 --> 01:01:05.990]  And now Michael Moore is running around calling for Hillary to be installed as president.
[01:01:06.550 --> 01:01:07.570]  And you know, my writers are great.
[01:01:07.610 --> 01:01:10.571]  I just said, it's always worse than I'm saying.
[01:01:10.951 --> 01:01:11.571]  Here's an example.
[01:01:11.751 --> 01:01:15.312]  Great writer Clifford Cuttingham wrote this, just came out, InfoWars.com.
[01:01:15.852 --> 01:01:19.033]  White House fears sabotage by intelligence industrial complex.
[01:01:19.693 --> 01:01:21.154]  Well, no, he doesn't fear it.
[01:01:21.174 --> 01:01:22.174]  He's come out and said,
[01:01:23.427 --> 01:01:25.567]  These are intelligence agencies that are sabotaging.
[01:01:25.647 --> 01:01:35.149]  I mean, we had Nancy Pelosi, Chuckie Schumer, all the usual suspects, in fact, let's cue one up, coming out threatening Trump when he was president-elect, saying, you better watch out.
[01:01:35.810 --> 01:01:38.290]  The intelligence agencies you're criticizing can bring you down.
[01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:47.732]  He meant Brennan, the Wahhabi agent, openly threatening him, and then he goes back and says, how dare you tell me what to do as the president-elect?
[01:01:48.763 --> 01:01:51.404]  They're like, we'll show you because they're belligerent, they're crazy!
[01:01:51.784 --> 01:01:55.606]  John McCain and the CIA leadership, at least at the time, are insane!
[01:01:57.146 --> 01:02:00.787]  The news thinks you're so dumb, they're like, the president isn't allowed to talk to Russians!
[01:02:01.348 --> 01:02:02.988]  Nobody else is but us!
[01:02:03.729 --> 01:02:06.309]  Hillary can meet with them in secret whenever she wants and take money.
[01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:15.553]  Then they, again, with people manipulating Trump in his own cabinet, sir, this is an issue, we need to just let the GOP know it's fine and
[01:02:16.735 --> 01:02:18.075]  You know, say that we've had no contact.
[01:02:18.716 --> 01:02:19.976]  Yeah, but I told him to call.
[01:02:20.956 --> 01:02:24.218]  I know, but just say that you didn't discuss specifics yourself, because only you're allowed to do that, sir.
[01:02:24.378 --> 01:02:24.958]  Which isn't even true.
[01:02:26.078 --> 01:02:27.038]  You find out what the Russians want.
[01:02:27.299 --> 01:02:29.419]  And then, well, Flynn, as you talk about it, no, nothing substantive.
[01:02:29.799 --> 01:02:30.860]  Just lining up the call for you.
[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:33.901]  But, oh, the Russians were saying, we want to talk about sanctions with the President.
[01:02:33.941 --> 01:02:34.581]  Okay, well, yeah.
[01:02:35.401 --> 01:02:42.704]  See, oh my gosh, but nobody cares about the President's new National Security Advisor being spied on by Obama.
[01:02:43.672 --> 01:02:45.393]  In the final days when they're a lame duck?
[01:02:46.294 --> 01:02:47.795]  I mean, this is so huge.
[01:02:50.097 --> 01:02:55.581]  That's why Michael Moore is so arrogant right now saying, remove him, install Hillary.
[01:02:55.621 --> 01:03:00.124]  You know what, I almost wish they removed Trump and installed that shaking, doddering.
[01:03:00.404 --> 01:03:03.747]  Did you see the photo of her wearing some weird Chinese outfit?
[01:03:03.767 --> 01:03:08.390]  I told you she keeps wearing Chinese classic communist era 1960s dresses.
[01:03:08.810 --> 01:03:10.712]  The very dresses that Mao Zedong's wife wore.
[01:03:12.405 --> 01:03:13.385]  I screenshotted it myself.
[01:03:13.405 --> 01:03:14.886]  I'm going to send it to you guys.
[01:03:15.966 --> 01:03:16.286]  There it is.
[01:03:16.326 --> 01:03:16.726]  You found it.
[01:03:17.506 --> 01:03:20.347]  Bill Clinton's wearing a weird leather jacket from the 70s.
[01:03:20.407 --> 01:03:22.007]  Or is that the 80s?
[01:03:22.728 --> 01:03:23.848]  That's a 1982 design.
[01:03:25.008 --> 01:03:30.509]  And then Hillary is wearing a communist Chinese or maybe even Tibetan style.
[01:03:30.589 --> 01:03:32.790]  I mean, the point is, is just look at these loons.
[01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:34.150]  They think they're rock stars.
[01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:41.432]  Billions of dollars stolen, swindling Haiti, meeting secretly with Putin, all their crimes, illegal servers, everything else.
[01:03:43.325 --> 01:03:48.148]  And when we come back, Roger Stone joins us from the road in our big exclusive.
[01:03:48.769 --> 01:03:50.350]  Let's see how much of this he's aware of.
[01:03:51.110 --> 01:03:53.932]  Priebus next to go as Trump strikes back over Flynn.
[01:03:56.133 --> 01:04:05.680]  And I'm telling Paul Watson here on air, I'm telling all my writers, all my people, because I mention this to them kind of week after week, and everybody just kind of goes, yeah, I got great writers, but they just kind of go, okay, yeah.
[01:04:08.271 --> 01:04:12.753]  I mean, the Communist Chinese are all over the news saying they're going to help take over our media and help censor Trump and the American people.
[01:04:13.133 --> 01:04:16.094]  The big media is saying, and the big tech companies are saying they're going to censor Trump.
[01:04:16.494 --> 01:04:18.695]  All during the election, they said they were involved in our election.
[01:04:18.955 --> 01:04:30.340]  We've got to have master articles and master videos, where all this is laid out, showing it piece by piece, how what they accused Trump of doing, they've done a trillion times, and then Trump has to go after them and get on the offensive.
[01:04:31.308 --> 01:04:36.232]  The Prevost is like, sir, show the party that you're going to be against this and that you're not with the Russians.
[01:04:36.332 --> 01:04:37.453]  Show them you're not with the Russians.
[01:04:37.553 --> 01:04:38.374]  Fire some people.
[01:04:39.655 --> 01:04:40.115]  OK.
[01:04:40.135 --> 01:04:42.077]  And then now you see Trump today.
[01:04:42.717 --> 01:04:43.738]  Oh, Flynn's wonderful.
[01:04:43.758 --> 01:04:44.619]  He didn't do anything wrong.
[01:04:44.979 --> 01:04:46.660]  He now knows it was a big mistake.
[01:04:47.681 --> 01:04:55.287]  Because they are gunning now, foaming at the mouth, and more is screaming for, you know, the overthrow and the installation.
[01:04:55.307 --> 01:04:57.309]  They're all calling for Trump's assassination.
[01:04:57.549 --> 01:04:58.490]  And where are the arrests?
[01:04:58.890 --> 01:04:59.671]  Where are the arrests?
[01:04:59.991 --> 01:05:00.792]  Where are the arrests?
[01:05:03.786 --> 01:05:05.908]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[01:05:06.348 --> 01:05:18.359]  The missing link of why our ancestors, whether you were in Africa or ancient Albion, which is England today, why our ancestors were so much stronger.
[01:05:18.379 --> 01:05:25.926]  I mean, there are huge archaeological reports, all sorts of anthropology studies, you can look them up for yourself, that show
[01:05:26.847 --> 01:05:35.070]  That humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[01:05:35.210 --> 01:05:41.352]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[01:05:42.233 --> 01:05:44.093]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[01:05:45.094 --> 01:05:46.314]  People are falling apart.
[01:05:46.354 --> 01:05:47.354]  They're totally depressed.
[01:05:47.374 --> 01:05:47.915]  They're unhappy.
[01:05:48.495 --> 01:05:49.475]  What is going on?
[01:05:50.736 --> 01:05:54.617]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[01:05:55.836 --> 01:05:58.419]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[01:05:58.799 --> 01:06:00.501]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[01:06:00.701 --> 01:06:07.729]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[01:06:07.949 --> 01:06:16.278]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWarsLife products.
[01:06:17.677 --> 01:06:24.184]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[01:06:24.564 --> 01:06:27.968]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[01:06:28.008 --> 01:06:31.151]  You used the skin to cover yourself for shelter.
[01:06:31.752 --> 01:06:36.838]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[01:06:37.358 --> 01:06:40.499]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:06:40.799 --> 01:06:51.224]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric roots, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[01:06:51.324 --> 01:06:52.764]  The bone is so amazing.
[01:06:53.205 --> 01:06:58.787]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[01:06:59.929 --> 01:07:02.851]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[01:07:03.371 --> 01:07:08.815]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[01:07:09.095 --> 01:07:18.581]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[01:07:18.841 --> 01:07:23.404]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[01:07:23.644 --> 01:07:25.424]  This is a absolute win-win.
[01:07:25.484 --> 01:07:28.265]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
[01:07:28.545 --> 01:07:34.666]  You support InfoWars and all we're doing to promote freedom and the restoration of our Republic and promotion of freedom worldwide.

[01:07:44.848 --> 01:07:49.249]  Three years in the making, incredible research, and the very best ingredients.
[01:07:49.769 --> 01:07:52.370]  I'm Alex Jones, and I may not be a caveman,
[01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:56.381]  But compared to these trendies out there in the street, I'm as close as it gets.
[01:07:56.761 --> 01:08:00.243]  Join me at InfoWarsLive.com and get your caveman formula today.
[01:08:04.325 --> 01:08:08.466]  When I was summoned from Montgomery, I had my guitar on my back.
[01:08:10.307 --> 01:08:13.908]  When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac.
[01:08:15.009 --> 01:08:17.470]  He was dressed like 1950, half drunk and hollow-eyed.
[01:08:20.575 --> 01:08:24.976]  He said, it's a long walk to Nashville, would you like to ride?
[01:08:25.297 --> 01:08:27.477]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:08:27.997 --> 01:08:32.819]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:08:32.839 --> 01:08:34.620]  I sat down in the front seat.
[01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:37.140]  He turned on the radio.
[01:08:37.821 --> 01:08:42.562]  And them sad old songs coming out of them speakers was solid country gold.
[01:08:43.602 --> 01:08:48.024]  Then I noticed a stranger was ghost-white pale when he asked me for a light.
[01:08:50.416 --> 01:08:54.678]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:08:54.718 --> 01:08:56.158]  to 3 p.m.
[01:08:56.178 --> 01:08:57.059]  We are here live.
[01:08:57.459 --> 01:08:59.520]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:03.161]  Boy, can you make folks feel what you feel inside.
[01:09:14.704 --> 01:09:16.024]  All right.
[01:09:16.645 --> 01:09:18.946]  Joining us is Roger Stone via the road.
[01:09:18.966 --> 01:09:20.227]  He's a very, very busy man.
[01:09:20.647 --> 01:09:25.430]  To give us the latest from his sources on what's happening inside the Trump White House.
[01:09:25.570 --> 01:09:27.552]  Michael Moore and others admit it's an attempted coup.
[01:09:27.592 --> 01:09:28.412]  They want him arrested.
[01:09:28.732 --> 01:09:30.113]  They want Hillary installed.
[01:09:30.193 --> 01:09:31.494]  They are calling everywhere.
[01:09:31.874 --> 01:09:37.258]  So many Hollywood people, entertainers, comics are calling for his murder.
[01:09:38.078 --> 01:09:39.840]  But I can't even keep track of it anymore.
[01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:47.466]  Republicans are refusing to repeal Obamacare, so he signed executive orders ordering the IRS not to fine people.
[01:09:48.267 --> 01:09:51.530]  So now the IRS has announced they will not take $5,000 out of your check.
[01:09:52.431 --> 01:09:57.015]  He is just battling to restore the republic, battling to get big banks to loan to small businesses.
[01:09:57.916 --> 01:10:01.959]  Yellen is against him now, and they want to raise interest rates so that it hurts the economy.
[01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:04.521]  This is just unprecedented.
[01:10:05.462 --> 01:10:10.484]  And I told everybody, I told Roger Stone on election night, I said, we can celebrate this a few days, but I said, the battle's just begun.
[01:10:10.544 --> 01:10:18.687]  This beachhead is so precious that, you know, now the war is just starting and they're trying to get rid of his security head.
[01:10:18.747 --> 01:10:19.468]  That's in the news.
[01:10:20.168 --> 01:10:26.971]  They are just, you know, they've taken out Flynn and the left's making him a victim now, which I think he is.
[01:10:29.645 --> 01:10:33.068]  Martyr and saying, oh, Trump ordered him to do it, and it's Trump.
[01:10:33.128 --> 01:10:34.809]  And Michael Moore's like, yeah, Trump ordered him.
[01:10:35.229 --> 01:10:39.553]  Of course the incoming president told his national security advisor to set up calls with the Russians.
[01:10:39.773 --> 01:10:40.814]  That's totally normal!
[01:10:40.834 --> 01:10:48.379]  I mean, Hillary went and negotiated with Obama secret TPP deals with private corporations and claimed it was the president's power, which it's not.
[01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:49.941]  But you can talk to world leaders.
[01:10:51.107 --> 01:10:54.289]  So I think Trump needs to get on the offensive now.
[01:10:54.870 --> 01:11:06.538]  And I put together all the mainstream articles admitting the Chinese funded Hillary, the Saudi Arabians funded her 20%, foreign governments involved trying to stop Trump when he was a candidate.
[01:11:07.579 --> 01:11:14.023]  So this thing about the National Security Advisor talked about setting a call up with the President and they wanted to discuss sanctions with the President.
[01:11:14.163 --> 01:11:15.064]  Well of course they did!
[01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:16.125]  That's what Presidents do!
[01:11:17.045 --> 01:11:19.347]  This is like saying they're going to arrest somebody for breathing.
[01:11:20.302 --> 01:11:25.849]  This is unprecedented and the Republican establishment, in my view Roger Stone, is the real threat.
[01:11:25.869 --> 01:11:27.191]  We have Dr. Jerome Corsi's article.
[01:11:28.467 --> 01:11:34.371]  On Infowars.com right now that says that Priebus next to go as Trump strikes back over Flynn.
[01:11:34.411 --> 01:11:38.894]  Trump rightfully says the leakers have committed felonies and it's felonies recording the president's people.
[01:11:39.235 --> 01:11:40.876]  So that's certainly true.
[01:11:41.196 --> 01:11:43.137]  But you're not one of my sources on this.
[01:11:43.197 --> 01:11:44.038]  Course he has his.
[01:11:44.198 --> 01:11:44.859]  I have mine.
[01:11:45.279 --> 01:11:46.500]  I sent you the article this morning.
[01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:47.541]  I don't know if you've read it.
[01:11:47.981 --> 01:11:54.065]  But can you tell me how accurate this is from from because I know you don't want to lose your sources by even putting stuff out.
[01:11:54.405 --> 01:11:57.928]  So many times you tell me stuff in confidence and I can never tell it and it comes true.
[01:11:58.208 --> 01:12:00.169]  But you've not been part of this story, Roger.
[01:12:01.370 --> 01:12:06.913]  No, first of all, I would have to congratulate Dr. Corsi because he is right on the money.
[01:12:07.814 --> 01:12:26.726]  He, of course, reported that despite the fact that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had a commitment from the White House Personnel Office that he would be able to interview the candidates for ambassadorships in the top 10 most crucial and most sensitive nations
[01:12:27.541 --> 01:12:45.305]  We learned that Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, took a list of 15 to the president two weeks ago, unbeknownst to anyone, and running state, got the president to sign off, and the background checks of those would-be ambassadors have begun.
[01:12:46.126 --> 01:12:55.968]  To a man that none of them are early Trump supporters, they appear to all be heavy Republican National Committee donors.
[01:12:57.267 --> 01:13:06.844]  I also think Dr. Corsi is absolutely right about the ouster of Mike Flynn being the Pearl Harbor for Trump associates.
[01:13:06.924 --> 01:13:08.647]  Make no mistake about this, Alex.
[01:13:09.188 --> 01:13:09.970]  First, it's Flynn.
[01:13:10.786 --> 01:13:13.387]  Then it's Stephen Miller, then Steve Bannon.
[01:13:13.707 --> 01:13:19.169]  Those are the targets for Reince Priebus and the establishment Republicans.
[01:13:19.229 --> 01:13:24.491]  And notice they're synced up with Michael Moore, who listed that exact list of people and said, then we're going to get Trump.
[01:13:24.511 --> 01:13:29.273]  So if Trump, I mean, I guarantee you know Priebus and them, advised him to cut Flynn loose.
[01:13:29.773 --> 01:13:31.793]  He's been gunning for Flynn, I mean, from the beginning.
[01:13:31.813 --> 01:13:32.934]  I even know that directly.
[01:13:32.954 --> 01:13:34.434]  And I know you know that as well.
[01:13:34.494 --> 01:13:35.855]  And that has been happening since day one.
[01:13:36.335 --> 01:13:38.416]  And so now they're after Bannon, they're after everybody else.
[01:13:38.956 --> 01:13:44.478]  But regardless, look at how the media is turning Flynn into a martyr now, saying he didn't really do anything wrong.
[01:13:45.279 --> 01:13:49.400]  So boy, they're setting it up to go after Trump right now.
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:52.902]  But let's talk about State Department, because this is where we have Priebus absolutely dead to rights.
[01:13:54.068 --> 01:13:58.452]  It's supposed to be the Secretary of State that vets this and does this with the President.
[01:13:58.472 --> 01:14:01.334]  But Priebus, as usual, is running the whole show, trying to.
[01:14:01.714 --> 01:14:03.876]  Trying to fire people who aren't really fired the rest of it.
[01:14:04.356 --> 01:14:06.238]  And so, concurring with this analysis...
[01:14:07.523 --> 01:14:12.527]  Then he's putting people in that aren't qualified or have bad past that could, again, burn Trump.
[01:14:12.547 --> 01:14:23.275]  So this looks like intentional sabotage, but regardless, we have the State Department in open revolt, pushing that they want to stop LePen and stop Wilder, claiming they're Russian agents because they're nationalists.
[01:14:23.595 --> 01:14:24.336]  This is insane.
[01:14:24.356 --> 01:14:26.357]  And going after Trump more.
[01:14:26.457 --> 01:14:28.619]  So, clearly, we've got a lot of insurrection here.
[01:14:28.659 --> 01:14:30.240]  Doug, what does Trump need to do right now?
[01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:34.484]  He needs to clean house, both at the White House and in his department.
[01:14:34.524 --> 01:14:36.265]  The problem we have here, Alex, is that
[01:14:37.092 --> 01:14:42.015]  80% of the people making decisions on a policy level are still Obama holdovers.
[01:14:42.615 --> 01:14:47.238]  We still have not fleshed out our own people in the crucial departments.
[01:14:47.738 --> 01:15:04.807]  And when I say our own people, I'm talking about highly qualified Trump loyalists, not Republican apparatchiks whose loyalties to the Republican National Committee or to the party, but people who are loyal to the president.
[01:15:04.827 --> 01:15:06.148]  Let me give you a perfect example.
[01:15:07.078 --> 01:15:12.060]  Ed Martin, former chief of staff to the governor of Missouri.
[01:15:12.739 --> 01:15:14.540]  Council to Pope John.
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:19.681]  Council to the Archdiocese of St.
[01:15:19.721 --> 01:15:20.102]  Louis.
[01:15:20.562 --> 01:15:23.043]  Former Chairman of the St.
[01:15:23.083 --> 01:15:24.583]  Louis Election Board.
[01:15:24.983 --> 01:15:28.304]  Former Chairman of the Missouri Republican Party.
[01:15:28.745 --> 01:15:32.246]  Speaks six languages, including Indonesian.
[01:15:32.726 --> 01:15:35.087]  Republican candidate for Attorney General.
[01:15:35.667 --> 01:15:41.549]  He is an exceptionally able man who was a very, very early and pivotal supporter
[01:15:42.248 --> 01:15:42.489]  Okay.
[01:15:54.977 --> 01:15:58.519]  Let's be clear.
[01:15:58.539 --> 01:15:59.180]  Let's be clear there.
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:01.441]  Let's be clear about what the President needs to do.
[01:16:02.081 --> 01:16:02.822]  Here's the bottom line.
[01:16:02.882 --> 01:16:13.167]  Trump is delivering on his promises to try to cut taxes, stop Obamacare, secure the borders, go after ISIS, get rid of NAFTA, kill TPP.
[01:16:13.187 --> 01:16:14.388]  That's all fabulous accomplishments.
[01:16:14.608 --> 01:16:15.589]  So he's delivering.
[01:16:16.129 --> 01:16:27.675]  But his minions, the party apparatchniks, like Priebus, who's a total minion as we all know, a groom of the stool for Paul Ryan, are openly sabotaging him.
[01:16:28.055 --> 01:16:36.140]  And surely the president understands that Priebus follows him around everywhere and he has to throw him out of meetings because the guy's a literal Republican Party operative.
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:40.682]  And I know that Trump tried to work with the Republican establishment to hopefully fix America.
[01:16:40.922 --> 01:16:41.782]  They're not going to do it.
[01:16:41.843 --> 01:16:42.683]  This is his message.
[01:16:43.163 --> 01:16:44.204]  You know, he didn't co-opt.
[01:16:46.349 --> 01:16:51.411]  I couldn't agree more.
[01:16:51.631 --> 01:16:56.952]  You have a situation in which the White House is leaking like a sieve.
[01:16:57.532 --> 01:17:01.113]  Now, I've been active in American politics for 40 years, Alex.
[01:17:01.193 --> 01:17:07.115]  I understand the value of the strategic leak, and there are many times when it's a legitimate political tool.
[01:17:07.155 --> 01:17:08.355]  But when you are leaking,
[01:17:09.514 --> 01:17:21.904]  To aggrandize yourself and to suck up to a reporter, and when you are leaking and you're making your boss, in this case the President of the United States, look terrible, you're doing an enormous disservice to your principles.
[01:17:21.944 --> 01:17:24.086]  Let me tell you how they're acting, Roger.
[01:17:24.126 --> 01:17:27.609]  They're acting like they think he's going to be gone soon, and they're just sucking up to the establishment.
[01:17:27.629 --> 01:17:29.611]  They act like conscious saboteurs.
[01:17:31.733 --> 01:17:34.575]  It could not be more brazen.
[01:17:35.688 --> 01:17:39.311]  And this was an overreaction when it comes to General Flynn.
[01:17:39.351 --> 01:17:41.212]  General Flynn has broken no laws.
[01:17:42.032 --> 01:17:45.375]  He could have simply issued an apology to the president and moved on.
[01:17:46.015 --> 01:17:53.740]  Instead, you know, Priebus and the party types now have a scout, and their appetite for blood has been whetted.
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:18:03.026]  Now they are going to come back after Stephen Miller, who is an incredibly capable individual who is merely working the president's
[01:18:03.459 --> 01:18:04.380]  Well, on issue.
[01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:05.400]  That's why they hate it.
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:08.222]  Every time I see Miller, I'm like, who is this young guy?
[01:18:08.502 --> 01:18:09.383]  He's on target.
[01:18:09.443 --> 01:18:10.243]  It's Americana.
[01:18:10.323 --> 01:18:11.284]  It sounds like Trump.
[01:18:11.604 --> 01:18:16.507]  The only other person now that we ever see is Miller and occasionally Bannon in an interview.
[01:18:16.847 --> 01:18:18.848]  They're the only ones that sound like Trump now.
[01:18:19.509 --> 01:18:20.069]  It's crazy.
[01:18:20.109 --> 01:18:25.433]  And then anybody that sounds like Trump or is carrying out the will of the guy we elected is being thrown overboard.
[01:18:26.253 --> 01:18:32.357]  And what I think is particularly entertaining is that you have Priebus and Bannon
[01:18:33.061 --> 01:18:37.743]  Calling reporters together, insisting that there is no discord.
[01:18:37.763 --> 01:18:40.084]  These are like hostage videos, is what they're like.
[01:18:40.844 --> 01:18:44.546]  Sure, they're going to say that on the record with their minders watching them.
[01:18:45.126 --> 01:18:49.248]  But in truth, Steve Bannon is the only one with the assistance of Stephen Miller.
[01:18:49.887 --> 01:18:51.527]  Who is protecting the Trump flame?
[01:18:51.627 --> 01:18:53.408]  Who is protecting the Trump agenda?
[01:18:53.688 --> 01:18:56.668]  Who understands who elected Donald Trump and why?
[01:18:56.748 --> 01:18:59.009]  I don't know people like you do, Miller.
[01:18:59.149 --> 01:19:08.451]  Whenever I see him, it's like, that guy is on target, he's piercing, he knows what he's talking about, he's hard-hitting, and it sounds like Trump because he's actually doing what the President says.
[01:19:08.471 --> 01:19:16.313]  I mean, I watch Spicer, the way he had viciously attacked Flynn, and then I see the President in a press conference say how great he is, and it's not good cop, bad cop.
[01:19:16.353 --> 01:19:18.133]  It's clear Spicer's doing whatever he wants.
[01:19:19.622 --> 01:19:37.113]  Well, again, this is the same Sean Spicer who undercut Donald Trump during the election, the same Sean Spicer who told reporters in September if Trump didn't get his poll numbers up, the Republican National Committee would have to suspend its financial support for the Trump candidacy.
[01:19:38.474 --> 01:19:43.657]  We, as Dr. Corsi reveals today, we now know that Reince Priebus
[01:19:44.716 --> 01:20:00.400]  Very carefully moved $750,000 in digital advertising from Donald Trump to Pat Toomey, the senator in Pennsylvania in the closing days, putting victory in Pennsylvania at real risk.
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:11.668]  It's extraordinary the way... It was Rince Priebus running around saying that the popular vote doesn't matter and trying to stop Trump getting the nomination.
[01:20:12.228 --> 01:20:15.171]  In fact, I think the only mistake Trump has made is putting this guy in there.
[01:20:16.492 --> 01:20:17.753]  An enormous mistake.
[01:20:17.873 --> 01:20:21.576]  Look, better a snake in the grass than an ass in the bosom.
[01:20:22.377 --> 01:20:22.597]  Yes.
[01:20:24.639 --> 01:20:25.139]  Absolutely.
[01:20:25.179 --> 01:20:25.960]  Good biblical saying.
[01:20:25.980 --> 01:20:27.841]  You don't want to have a viper in your pants.
[01:20:27.861 --> 01:20:29.182]  It's better to have them in the grass.
[01:20:29.262 --> 01:20:29.463]  I agree.
[01:20:31.314 --> 01:20:34.516]  And look, it's very clear the President needs to clean house.
[01:20:34.616 --> 01:20:44.460]  He needs a team of men and women who are dedicated Trumpites, who are dedicated anti-globalists, who see the big picture.
[01:20:44.540 --> 01:21:00.326]  The only two members of the White House staff, putting aside clerical positions and advanced men, advanced people, the only identifiable Trump supporters in the White House staff are Steve Bannon and Steve Miller.
[01:21:02.048 --> 01:21:06.814]  Kellyanne Conway, who I have a high regard for, you know, originally was for Ted Cruz.
[01:21:07.414 --> 01:21:10.998]  At least in her case, she was for Donald Trump before the convention.
[01:21:11.058 --> 01:21:15.644]  But notice because she's a genuine person, they're gunning for her now saying she's committed crimes.
[01:21:16.909 --> 01:21:18.230]  Look, this is ridiculous.
[01:21:18.250 --> 01:21:22.133]  She says something nice about Ivanka.
[01:21:22.473 --> 01:21:23.594]  Yeah, no, here's how it works.
[01:21:23.654 --> 01:21:27.918]  They're trying to boycott everything we stand for to bankrupt Americans that are patriots.
[01:21:28.118 --> 01:21:29.619]  They're in an economic war with us.
[01:21:29.999 --> 01:21:34.142]  And so, yeah, we've got to boost each other and shop with each other and help each other.
[01:21:34.182 --> 01:21:34.883]  That's our power.
[01:21:35.203 --> 01:21:39.767]  I mean, back in the Clinton Foundation days at their presidential foundation,
[01:21:40.487 --> 01:21:46.171]  They said we've got to stop conservatives or libertarians or Christians ever creating their own economy or they'll defeat us.
[01:21:46.511 --> 01:21:47.732]  They want to starve us out.
[01:21:47.752 --> 01:21:48.312]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:21:49.133 --> 01:21:50.354]  That's exactly right.
[01:21:53.852 --> 01:21:55.352]  I think so.
[01:22:14.159 --> 01:22:19.623]  Susan, this was a warm comment of 10 seconds, not exactly heavy marketing.
[01:22:20.304 --> 01:22:25.248]  It's an absurdity, but there is, as you point out Alex, a double standard.
[01:22:25.768 --> 01:22:33.694]  The Clintons can loot, and they can pillage, and they can steal literally hundreds of millions, and there are no consequences.
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:43.167]  Kellyanne Conway says something nice on television about Ivanka's makeup line, and we act like it's a capital crime.
[01:22:43.247 --> 01:22:48.572]  Well, in the time we've got, there's about 6-7 minutes left with you, Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign.
[01:22:49.212 --> 01:22:50.854]  Let's talk about where we are right now.
[01:22:50.874 --> 01:22:57.800]  I'm not in some panic mode, other than the fact that the left and the right-wingers are openly saying they want to kill Trump, they want to overthrow him, they want him out of office.
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:01.723]  I mean, this is the mouth of the Democratic Party, Michael Moore, saying this.
[01:23:02.444 --> 01:23:03.825]  They're completely out of their minds.
[01:23:04.585 --> 01:23:07.668]  Again, Maxine Waters thinks that Putin has invaded Korea.
[01:23:07.688 --> 01:23:16.336]  At the same press conference, Pelosi thinks that Bush is still in office, George W. So it's very dangerous, their arrogance.
[01:23:16.576 --> 01:23:20.599]  And then I see Trump trying to get his agenda through, and the Republicans trying to block it.
[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:24.442]  If I was the president, I'd come out and say, you know something?
[01:23:25.305 --> 01:23:40.517]  And I would have exhibits, and I would show where the Communist Chinese and the Saudi Arabians gave all this money to Hillary, and how she met with Putin secretly, twice, and all the stuff that's come out, and then say, and then Flynn is on the phone setting up phone calls for me, and they're recording him, trying to act like that's dirty.
[01:23:40.737 --> 01:23:42.979]  The President and his people talk to the Russians.
[01:23:43.239 --> 01:23:44.040]  That's what we do.
[01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:45.161]  That's why we have a red phone.
[01:23:45.521 --> 01:23:46.281]  This is insane.
[01:23:46.341 --> 01:23:50.825]  Hillary and Obama negotiated TPP in secret with foreign corporations.
[01:23:50.925 --> 01:23:53.087]  Probably not legal, my experts tell me.
[01:23:53.447 --> 01:23:54.508]  But that's all bygones.
[01:23:54.628 --> 01:23:55.468]  I killed that thing.
[01:23:56.148 --> 01:24:00.711]  You know, the idea that I'm a Russian spy, or all of this, is a way to make it sound like you didn't elect me.
[01:24:01.151 --> 01:24:03.392]  These people are dangerous, and so that's it.
[01:24:03.432 --> 01:24:12.257]  You want the gloves off, I'm gonna have Sessions and everybody else start investigating all these reports where the Saudis bragged that they put Hillary, you know, in the campaign and all this.
[01:24:12.637 --> 01:24:14.580]  You know, you want to fight, you've got one, you're criminals.
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:19.025]  I think he needs to absolutely get up on his hind legs because it's ridiculous.
[01:24:19.045 --> 01:24:29.779]  He's fighting a group of criminals openly trying to organize his murder or impeachment and shutting down the free press and killing our recovery and putting the screwjob Obamacare on us, Roger.
[01:24:31.195 --> 01:24:49.735]  Well listen Alex, there's nothing like waking up in the morning as I did this morning and reading on the front page of the New York Times, yet again, that the Central Intelligence Agency has uncovered communications between Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, and Carter Page, and the Russians.
[01:24:50.399 --> 01:24:58.002]  This story is a total, complete recycle of the exact same story that they ran on January 20th.
[01:24:58.102 --> 01:25:00.303]  It was false then.
[01:25:00.803 --> 01:25:03.644]  It is categorically false now.
[01:25:03.784 --> 01:25:04.364]  Let's be clear.
[01:25:04.444 --> 01:25:05.124]  Let's be clear about this.
[01:25:05.144 --> 01:25:06.085]  I should have brought this up first.
[01:25:06.145 --> 01:25:15.688]  They're saying, it's all over the news, that you and Manafort and your former business partner, all these other people, who are literally working with the Russians, when Manafort had elected Ukraine moving into the EU.
[01:25:15.808 --> 01:25:16.809]  It's laughable.
[01:25:17.209 --> 01:25:17.689]  Meanwhile,
[01:25:18.389 --> 01:25:20.151]  If they had the communications, they would have released them.
[01:25:20.191 --> 01:25:25.076]  Unless they're claiming someone you talked to that you didn't know could be a Russian asset was one.
[01:25:25.296 --> 01:25:26.497]  But then, that's not illegal.
[01:25:26.717 --> 01:25:28.459]  Plus, talking to someone's not illegal.
[01:25:28.659 --> 01:25:29.640]  You're a member of the press.
[01:25:29.881 --> 01:25:32.303]  But the point is, no one's ever said you're some ruski.
[01:25:32.523 --> 01:25:35.366]  But now they're saying, and as you said, totally recycled.
[01:25:35.406 --> 01:25:36.187]  What does this signify?
[01:25:37.304 --> 01:25:47.351]  Well, they say that they have email transmissions and documenting financial transactions.
[01:25:47.471 --> 01:25:48.492]  This is really simple.
[01:25:49.112 --> 01:25:50.753]  Put up or shut up.
[01:25:51.794 --> 01:25:53.175]  We've seen no proof of this.
[01:25:53.275 --> 01:25:54.976]  They're just recycling allegations.
[01:25:55.156 --> 01:25:59.119]  And you've been saying, say it again, you want to go to Congress, you want to testify.
[01:25:59.139 --> 01:26:03.041]  They said they would before, but you didn't die with the polonium attack, unfortunately.
[01:26:03.321 --> 01:26:05.423]  So now, I guess they don't want to have you before them, do they?
[01:26:06.215 --> 01:26:12.656]  No, in fact, they don't even want to have public hearings, because I think they know that I would decimate them in public hearings.
[01:26:12.716 --> 01:26:13.876]  So would Paul Manafort.
[01:26:14.276 --> 01:26:16.057]  I spoke to Manafort late last night.
[01:26:16.117 --> 01:26:17.857]  I read his statement in the New York Times.
[01:26:18.477 --> 01:26:19.497]  He is confounded.
[01:26:20.037 --> 01:26:23.238]  He also categorically denies- He said he's boggled.
[01:26:23.278 --> 01:26:24.078]  He's boggled.
[01:26:24.158 --> 01:26:24.818]  He's boggled.
[01:26:25.798 --> 01:26:28.039]  Because this is made up whole cloth.
[01:26:28.099 --> 01:26:29.579]  Now, let's get to the more important point.
[01:26:30.299 --> 01:26:34.220]  John Brennan, the former CIA director, is the source of these stories.
[01:26:35.385 --> 01:26:37.866]  I think the wrong person is being investigated here.
[01:26:37.987 --> 01:26:41.288]  If somebody's being investigated, it should be Mr. Brennan.
[01:26:41.328 --> 01:26:43.229]  Why is Brennan so incredibly arrogant?
[01:26:44.310 --> 01:26:51.954]  Well, because I think he actually thought he would be reappointed to the CIA position by Donald Trump.
[01:26:52.034 --> 01:26:54.556]  After all, he came in under George Bush.
[01:26:54.656 --> 01:26:56.757]  He was retained by Barack Obama.
[01:26:57.518 --> 01:27:05.704]  How did this man, who refused to be sworn on a Bible when he became CIA director, who admits a long-time involvement in the U.S.
[01:27:05.744 --> 01:27:12.368]  Communist Party and support for their candidate for president, how did this man ever get confirmed by the U.S.
[01:27:12.408 --> 01:27:12.708]  Senate?
[01:27:12.928 --> 01:27:17.752]  And now he's so delusional, like so many employees are, when they finally think that they're your boss.
[01:27:18.432 --> 01:27:19.513]  This is total mental illness.
[01:27:19.573 --> 01:27:24.016]  I mean, I've never seen a CIA director go anywhere near this, telling a president, you watch yourself.
[01:27:24.456 --> 01:27:25.036]  What the hell?
[01:27:25.097 --> 01:27:27.118]  He actually said, the President better watch his mouth.
[01:27:28.359 --> 01:27:29.079]  The arrogance!
[01:27:29.139 --> 01:27:30.300]  Yeah, watch your mouth!
[01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:31.101]  It's even worse!
[01:27:31.841 --> 01:27:32.101]  Right?
[01:27:32.121 --> 01:27:38.965]  So, I mean, look, the real person Attorney General Sessions should be opening an inquiry to is Mr. Brennan.
[01:27:39.425 --> 01:27:41.827]  It's time to really expose... I agree.
[01:27:41.847 --> 01:27:50.211]  So time to take the gloves off, criminal investigation of Brennan, grab these leakers, all of them, and it's time for them to be indicted.
[01:27:50.251 --> 01:27:51.412]  They've committed crimes and submitted.
[01:27:53.873 --> 01:27:54.714]  Absolutely true.
[01:27:55.239 --> 01:27:56.319]  What else can Trump do?
[01:27:56.379 --> 01:27:59.700]  Because, I mean, they really think they're going to get him on this Russian stuff.
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:02.001]  I mean, Brennan really thinks he's the President of the United States.
[01:28:03.181 --> 01:28:10.963]  The President should launch his own investigation, should appoint the appropriate law enforcement officials in his administration.
[01:28:11.903 --> 01:28:14.784]  I assume that that's justice to get to the bottom of this.
[01:28:15.364 --> 01:28:24.706]  If justice cannot find any proof of these CIA claims, then they should say so and put an end to this tedious nonsense.
[01:28:25.854 --> 01:28:28.815]  But at the same time, here's the real irony.
[01:28:29.756 --> 01:28:31.597]  All of this leaking is illegal.
[01:28:31.857 --> 01:28:35.278]  All of this spying on Trump officials is illegal.
[01:28:35.919 --> 01:28:39.500]  This reminds me of the entire offensive of the Clinton people.
[01:28:39.941 --> 01:28:42.942]  They didn't want to focus on the substance of the WikiLeaks.
[01:28:43.382 --> 01:28:46.964]  They wanted to focus or distract people to where those leaks came from.
[01:28:46.984 --> 01:28:47.324]  That's right.
[01:28:47.364 --> 01:28:48.905]  Let me ask you this for the time we have.
[01:28:48.965 --> 01:28:49.705]  It's immaterial.
[01:28:49.765 --> 01:28:51.626]  The leaks showed that they were criminal.
[01:28:52.159 --> 01:28:59.488]  Let me ask you this, just in your gut, because I talked to you days before and you said Flynn's gone, he's gone, even though you think it's wrong and it was an exaggeration.
[01:29:00.929 --> 01:29:04.513]  You'd tell me off record, I'd say it on air before, that no, Flynn's toast was your quote.
[01:29:05.134 --> 01:29:06.416]  What do you think about Priebus?
[01:29:06.456 --> 01:29:07.277]  How long can he hang on?
[01:29:08.464 --> 01:29:12.366]  Well, I think he is going to be fairly entrenched here for a little bit.
[01:29:12.426 --> 01:29:14.126]  I think he will ultimately go.
[01:29:15.187 --> 01:29:21.709]  He seems to have the support of the President's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, but he's a liability.
[01:29:21.849 --> 01:29:28.372]  They need somebody who's not in over his head and whose first and only loyalty is to the President.
[01:29:28.412 --> 01:29:37.055]  You see, the game here, Alex, is Reince Priebus would like to limit the access of anybody who has an independent line of communications
[01:29:37.957 --> 01:29:42.661]  That's right, he's clearly been meeting with Twitter and they've blocked the public.
[01:29:47.124 --> 01:29:47.925]  Amazing, Roger.
[01:29:47.945 --> 01:29:49.186]  We're going to have you back on soon.
[01:29:49.246 --> 01:29:49.967]  Thank you so much.
[01:29:49.987 --> 01:29:52.549]  Get his book at Infowarsstore.com and support us all.
[01:29:52.609 --> 01:29:53.489]  We're on the march.
[01:29:53.970 --> 01:29:55.571]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:56.512 --> 01:29:59.194]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:04.144 --> 01:30:10.298]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[01:30:10.859 --> 01:30:12.263]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[01:30:13.154 --> 01:30:15.035]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[01:30:15.655 --> 01:30:21.217]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[01:30:21.798 --> 01:30:29.781]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[01:30:29.801 --> 01:30:32.262]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[01:30:32.542 --> 01:30:33.742]  This is the best system out there.
[01:30:34.022 --> 01:30:36.784]  And we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[01:30:37.024 --> 01:30:37.764]  This is how it works.
[01:30:38.084 --> 01:30:38.564]  You order.
[01:30:38.704 --> 01:30:39.505]  Customized or
[01:30:40.606 --> 01:30:42.067]  Straight from the factory, however you want it.
[01:30:42.548 --> 01:30:45.710]  It is shipped on the next business day to you and your family.
[01:30:46.010 --> 01:30:50.054]  And a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this republic.
[01:30:50.274 --> 01:30:51.055]  You cannot lose.
[01:30:51.075 --> 01:30:52.175]  You're funding the Infowar.
[01:30:52.496 --> 01:30:59.241]  You're getting the highest quality product, the most tested, the most durable, the most certified, the most believed in.
[01:30:59.562 --> 01:31:03.505]  You need to have this true piece of America ready in minutes.
[01:31:04.105 --> 01:31:09.229]  The military industrial complex is trying to sabotage Donald Trump.
[01:31:09.389 --> 01:31:13.491]  Last night, National Security Advisor Michael Flynn officially resigned.
[01:31:13.531 --> 01:31:18.695]  This following reports that he had misled officials about his contacts with Russia.
[01:31:18.755 --> 01:31:25.880]  Meanwhile, the establishment media says this validates their conspiracy theory that Russia hacked the U.S.
[01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:26.420]  elections.
[01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:32.864]  They're also claiming that General Flynn's conversation with the Russian ambassador is a violation of the Logan Act.
[01:31:33.064 --> 01:31:33.745]  But wait a minute.
[01:31:34.045 --> 01:31:37.508]  Where was the mainstream media during the Bilderberg conferences?
[01:31:37.728 --> 01:31:47.335]  You know, the secret group of global elitists ignored by the mainstream media as they privately meet each year to plan and coordinate global policy.
[01:31:47.635 --> 01:31:56.581]  Look, the establishment wants to purge the Trump administration and replace them with compromised Washington insiders and globalists.
[01:31:56.701 --> 01:31:59.863]  In other words, they are trying to refill the swamp.
[01:32:00.164 --> 01:32:02.605]  You can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[01:32:03.766 --> 01:32:08.172]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[01:32:08.252 --> 01:32:19.206]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[01:32:19.346 --> 01:32:24.289]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[01:32:24.389 --> 01:32:26.911]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[01:32:26.971 --> 01:32:28.472]  It helps detoxify.
[01:32:28.692 --> 01:32:31.514]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[01:32:31.574 --> 01:32:36.317]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[01:32:36.337 --> 01:32:42.581]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[01:32:42.601 --> 01:32:47.924]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[01:32:47.944 --> 01:32:48.705]  I'm taking it now.
[01:32:48.985 --> 01:32:49.445]  Every day.
[01:32:49.646 --> 01:32:50.366]  This is so key.
[01:32:50.627 --> 01:32:52.949]  BioTrue Selenium is the product.
[01:32:53.189 --> 01:32:54.931]  The best selenium that we could bring you.
[01:32:54.951 --> 01:32:57.054]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[01:32:57.174 --> 01:33:00.637]  Exclusively available at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:33:03.922 --> 01:33:10.968]  Well, conspiracy theories are running wild tonight about the Army's plan for a multi-state training exercise this summer called Jade Helm 15.
[01:33:11.528 --> 01:33:18.234]  While the military says it's just training soldiers for the realities of war, critics say the Army is preparing for modern-day martial law.
[01:33:18.414 --> 01:33:21.977]  We really didn't have the violence that we see today.
[01:33:22.778 --> 01:33:27.602]  The weaponry is totally different now than it was in the beginning of my career.
[01:33:28.402 --> 01:33:36.566]  Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[01:33:51.263 --> 01:33:53.984]  I'm a sovereign citizen.
[01:33:54.064 --> 01:33:55.324]  I refuse to recognize you guys.
[01:33:55.684 --> 01:33:58.405]  I refuse to recognize you.
[01:33:58.445 --> 01:34:04.306]  That was interesting.
[01:34:04.326 --> 01:34:14.549]  The nice thing about this piece of equipment is that if somebody is directing fire toward a team that's trying to get in, they can pull right up to them.
[01:34:14.609 --> 01:34:20.010]  You can take enemy fire and still try to address the threat without being afraid of getting shot.
[01:34:20.310 --> 01:34:24.952]  So I'm thinking that is totally appropriate in Iraq, but what kind of a situation in the U.S.
[01:34:24.992 --> 01:34:25.992]  would you see that happening?
[01:34:26.052 --> 01:34:30.074]  I mean, we've got a lot of Constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[01:34:30.094 --> 01:34:32.535]  A lot of ammunition.
[01:34:32.755 --> 01:34:37.097]  I mean, we've got a lot of Constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[01:34:37.517 --> 01:34:38.758]  A lot of ammunition.
[01:34:38.778 --> 01:34:42.119]  They have no weapons here locally.
[01:34:42.499 --> 01:34:44.020]  So what happens if the PLR take over?
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:46.361]  Once you're run by terrorists, ain't good.
[01:34:47.401 --> 01:34:50.784]  Bro, America was founded by terrorists, for terrorists.
[01:34:51.364 --> 01:34:53.466]  What do you think the f**k the Revolutionary War was?
[01:34:53.646 --> 01:34:57.169]  The mystery is determined by the f**k you picked.
[01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:58.871]  How did you even get into the Marines?
[01:34:59.031 --> 01:35:05.917]  Who was the first terrorist organization in the United States?
[01:35:05.997 --> 01:35:06.217]  Who?
[01:35:06.357 --> 01:35:07.078]  Family of Bob.
[01:35:07.418 --> 01:35:09.119]  You mean Thomas Jefferson?
[01:35:09.159 --> 01:35:09.900]  Oh yeah.
[01:35:09.980 --> 01:35:11.581]  You mean George Washington?
[01:35:11.641 --> 01:35:12.042]  Oh yeah.
[01:35:12.162 --> 01:35:13.243]  Paul McGarrett?
[01:35:13.883 --> 01:35:15.445]  These guys right here,
[01:35:16.542 --> 01:35:17.863]  Can we ask you something?
[01:35:17.903 --> 01:35:20.144]  Did they try to scare people?
[01:35:20.164 --> 01:35:23.386]  They tried to intimidate the British?
[01:35:23.446 --> 01:35:25.207]  Did they use acts of violence?
[01:35:25.248 --> 01:35:30.631]  Your founding fathers, my founding fathers, were involved in acts of terrorism against British officials.
[01:35:31.701 --> 01:35:35.144]  Jade Helm troops who operate undetected amongst civilian population.
[01:35:35.664 --> 01:35:38.166]  And of course, the military people and the vets are not buying any of it.
[01:35:38.186 --> 01:35:38.766]  They're not stupid.
[01:35:39.107 --> 01:35:44.831]  You can read about how it's to get the hearts and minds and how to get the public used to working and the local police working with the military.
[01:35:45.292 --> 01:35:51.196]  I mean, everybody who's been in the military knows about the secret EOD program going on for 18 years.
[01:35:51.616 --> 01:35:55.780]  Their whole ordinance disposal, you know, quote, the army is going to show up to defuse a bomb.
[01:35:56.570 --> 01:35:58.531]  But then you get the internal agreements.
[01:35:58.651 --> 01:36:06.274]  It's for everything from warrant service to checkpoints with military personnel in nondescript blue jumpsuits.
[01:36:06.434 --> 01:36:11.115]  Just like the Army Ranger called in and said they were wearing EPA blue jumpsuits.
[01:36:11.195 --> 01:36:13.956]  It's always blue or tan jumpsuits.
[01:36:14.757 --> 01:36:16.437]  And it might say EPA.
[01:36:16.537 --> 01:36:17.718]  It might say police.
[01:36:18.758 --> 01:36:20.039]  It might say park serfs.
[01:36:21.019 --> 01:36:39.399]  Training with the police, training with locals, in plain clothes, quote, doing suspicious activities, is to train the police to work with the military in covert operations, and to condition the military to accept it, and to condition the public to accept it, and then when we cover it and talk about it, they practice the PSYOP in real time, putting out this information.
[01:36:39.459 --> 01:36:41.200]  I can see the script from Army Times.
[01:36:42.378 --> 01:36:50.813]  To Military.com, to Stars and Stripes, to Bloomberg, to Daily Beast, to Vice, to the Houston Chronicle, and no exaggeration today.
[01:36:52.856 --> 01:36:54.700]  You go search Jade Helm.
[01:36:57.591 --> 01:37:02.294]  There are now hundreds of articles, and in almost all of them, yours truly is being demonized.
[01:37:02.634 --> 01:37:09.518]  Jones, who's warned of an imminent takeover for decades, keeps claiming it's gonna happen, but of course it never does.
[01:37:09.718 --> 01:37:11.279]  No, it never does!
[01:37:11.699 --> 01:37:23.085]  Checkpoints, TSA, open spying, highway dividers being put up nationwide, open manuals that the number one enemies, veterans and gun owners and Christians, I mean, come on!
[01:37:24.706 --> 01:37:25.767]  This is the PSYOP!
[01:37:29.344 --> 01:37:31.106]  Alright, that's from a couple years ago.
[01:37:31.507 --> 01:37:37.734]  Now it's been released by the Pentagon in official videos and documents that they intend to occupy the United States.
[01:37:37.774 --> 01:37:40.017]  That was the orders under Obama for a collapse.
[01:37:40.537 --> 01:37:46.685]  While the Obama globalist forces have moved to create civil unrest and a dystopian atmosphere.
[01:37:48.188 --> 01:37:55.731]  I'm not against the military, I'm against it being used against the American people when the globalists trigger this collapse-type scenario.
[01:37:56.171 --> 01:38:05.835]  So after Rob Dude leaves us here in a moment, I am going to get more into this ahead of our next guest joining us.
[01:38:06.515 --> 01:38:14.358]  Because, again, I cannot stress to you how incendiary, how explosive, how serious this timeframe is we're all living in.
[01:38:14.398 --> 01:38:17.099]  And what we do is totally critical.
[01:38:17.895 --> 01:38:25.993]  They didn't want a national debate about how the Pentagon's openly trying to take over the United States under federal orders and merge us with the UN and the globalists.
[01:38:27.284 --> 01:38:34.630]  They don't want it known that China's openly announcing, like we're idiots, that they're going to help censor the web and work with Zuckerberg and Google and others.
[01:38:35.051 --> 01:38:35.611]  It's all there.
[01:38:35.811 --> 01:38:36.712]  It's in PC world.
[01:38:37.253 --> 01:38:39.134]  But when we go, oh look, you're rolling it out.
[01:38:39.174 --> 01:38:40.916]  See, when they roll it out all positive, they admit it.
[01:38:40.936 --> 01:38:43.818]  When we say, hey, we don't like that, they go, you're insane.
[01:38:44.158 --> 01:38:46.520]  The military didn't invade Texas in 2015.
[01:38:46.741 --> 01:38:47.381]  We never said that.
[01:38:47.741 --> 01:38:49.023]  We said you're training to invade.
[01:38:50.784 --> 01:38:52.486]  So see, they changed the subject, but now
[01:38:53.504 --> 01:38:57.226]  It's in the Intercept, it's in Zero Heads because it just links the Army's own website.
[01:38:58.007 --> 01:39:00.468]  They're announcing everything we told you from Jade Helm.
[01:39:02.590 --> 01:39:05.831]  And they're pushing to get it out now that Trump's in because they want to have a debate about this.
[01:39:07.112 --> 01:39:13.476]  It's great to have the military for floods or fires or any type of disasters like that, but to culturally run our society because it's collapsing?
[01:39:13.836 --> 01:39:15.998]  We don't need that and it's not constitutional.
[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:23.003]  We need to restore power to the states and the people, and we can take care of ourselves, and the military can protect our borders and against foreign threats.
[01:39:23.043 --> 01:39:26.325]  But this was the globalist model, and it's happening all over the world.
[01:39:26.345 --> 01:39:34.450]  Just like the EU said two years ago, now officially, we will put EU troops inside every country, take over your military, you're not allowed to leave.
[01:39:35.590 --> 01:39:38.212]  Because we're going to have insurrection, because they bring in all the Muslims.
[01:39:38.672 --> 01:39:43.254]  They bring in the destabilization force, and then this whole thing unfolds.
[01:39:44.557 --> 01:39:50.599]  Just because I've learned how the media works, and I want to take a story that's important but make it even more important, I'm going to give you some inside baseball.
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:58.842]  We get contacted by the vaccine group that is putting on the Robert De Niro, Robert F. Kennedy vaccine event.
[01:39:59.422 --> 01:40:03.584]  And they want us to come and be part of it, and then they want to give us an exclusive interview with Robert De Niro.
[01:40:04.104 --> 01:40:05.865]  My audience doesn't care about Robert De Niro.
[01:40:06.285 --> 01:40:07.465]  I don't care about Robert De Niro.
[01:40:07.505 --> 01:40:09.126]  He's in some movies, he's a good actor, big deal.
[01:40:11.087 --> 01:40:12.327]  We're post-celebrity culture.
[01:40:13.348 --> 01:40:14.008]  I never liked it.
[01:40:16.263 --> 01:40:17.363]  Our audience finally hates it.
[01:40:18.004 --> 01:40:18.804]  Thank God we're here.
[01:40:19.484 --> 01:40:20.364]  And everybody gets this.
[01:40:20.444 --> 01:40:27.327]  I was on a big TV show yesterday, and they're like, absolutely, we don't call anybody celebrities.
[01:40:27.347 --> 01:40:28.207]  Everybody hates that term.
[01:40:28.647 --> 01:40:32.889]  But I told them, I said, as a learning experience, you can go to this, because you want to go.
[01:40:32.909 --> 01:40:35.609]  And then I said, you're not going to get the Robert De Niro interview.
[01:40:35.630 --> 01:40:38.250]  And I said, they'll tell you you're going to get one, and they're not going to get it.
[01:40:38.530 --> 01:40:39.791]  They're just having you come to cover it.
[01:40:40.879 --> 01:40:42.180]  Because this is the culture in America.
[01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:43.281]  Manipulate everybody.
[01:40:43.602 --> 01:40:46.664]  This is what Hollywood folks do when they do an event.
[01:40:46.905 --> 01:40:50.328]  It's all about gaming everyone and manipulating the crew and who comes.
[01:40:50.528 --> 01:40:51.749]  It's a Machiavellian thing.
[01:40:52.049 --> 01:40:53.171]  It's like a snake biting you.
[01:40:53.191 --> 01:40:53.771]  We can't help it.
[01:40:54.232 --> 01:40:55.993]  Eliza Scorpion, you know, attacked the toad.
[01:40:56.674 --> 01:41:00.878]  But the reason I said do this is it's good that Trump
[01:41:02.213 --> 01:41:08.557]  He's bringing in Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who I've had on the show, who's right about vaccines being dangerous and there being serious problems.
[01:41:09.318 --> 01:41:10.979]  And De Niro's had one of his kids hurt by this.
[01:41:11.059 --> 01:41:12.920]  So, you know, he's a good guy on that front.
[01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:26.249]  But I said Trump's the one actually traveling the country just yesterday calling for vaccines to be investigated and setting up a commission to bring attention to it and presidential support to go after Big Pharma and the crimes it's committed and the fact that they're giving liability protection.
[01:41:26.489 --> 01:41:28.090]  And I said, I want you to bring that up to him.
[01:41:28.651 --> 01:41:29.091]  And he did.
[01:41:29.111 --> 01:41:31.933]  And De Niro said, I don't want to make this about Trump, but if he does something good, that's fine.
[01:41:32.753 --> 01:41:34.415]  Yeah, something really good for real kids.
[01:41:34.455 --> 01:41:34.995]  Right, DeNiro?
[01:41:37.157 --> 01:41:38.098]  Because he really cares.
[01:41:38.598 --> 01:41:39.078]  He's real.
[01:41:39.459 --> 01:41:40.519]  He really wants to help people.
[01:41:41.820 --> 01:41:43.482]  And so they got that question in, but you know what?
[01:41:43.582 --> 01:41:45.243]  It's not even worth playing.
[01:41:45.503 --> 01:41:47.305]  Robert DeNiro is that boring.
[01:41:47.585 --> 01:41:48.826]  I piss on Robert DeNiro.
[01:41:49.861 --> 01:41:55.842]  Hey, Robert De Niro, I go on Joe Rogan's podcast, one of the biggest in the world, and it becomes the biggest in world history.
[01:41:56.043 --> 01:41:57.463]  Brother, I don't want to be a star.
[01:41:57.663 --> 01:41:58.303]  I want to be free.
[01:41:58.523 --> 01:42:00.524]  You're a joke that reads off teleprompters.
[01:42:01.024 --> 01:42:03.024]  You really care about your kid and other people's kids?
[01:42:03.204 --> 01:42:10.786]  You'd admit Trump was right, but you don't do it because you're a coward that goes on shows and talks about punching people in the nose because you act like a tough guy in the movies.
[01:42:11.246 --> 01:42:13.267]  You ever really beat somebody's brains out, De Niro?
[01:42:13.527 --> 01:42:14.387]  I bet you haven't!
[01:42:14.807 --> 01:42:17.928]  No, because I read about you and your dad, the artist, and all the rest of it.
[01:42:18.108 --> 01:42:19.268]  I don't care if your dad was gay.
[01:42:19.448 --> 01:42:20.429]  No chip on the shoulder there.
[01:42:20.589 --> 01:42:22.989]  But you were brought up a little candy-ass artist!
[01:42:23.269 --> 01:42:25.150]  So stop acting like you're a tough guy!
[01:42:25.170 --> 01:42:29.011]  And stop running our military down!
[01:42:29.031 --> 01:42:30.932]  Piece of crap!
[01:42:32.052 --> 01:42:33.712]  So, Dew is now on.
[01:42:33.852 --> 01:42:34.893]  He can tell you how right I was.
[01:42:34.993 --> 01:42:37.253]  Everything I said happened exactly as I said.
[01:42:37.533 --> 01:42:42.695]  And the only reason I say that is, not from arrogance, but so you know, I know what I'm talking about!
[01:42:43.686 --> 01:42:46.807]  Because scum operates the same every time.
[01:42:48.548 --> 01:42:49.008]  And here's the thing.
[01:42:49.668 --> 01:42:51.329]  I don't care about Robert De Niro.
[01:42:51.669 --> 01:42:52.889]  I sent our crew to D.C.
[01:42:53.449 --> 01:42:58.111]  because I wanted to draw attention to the fact that people are trying to do something about vaccines.
[01:42:59.011 --> 01:43:06.074]  And the good side of De Niro got intimidated into not showing at one of his film festivals a film about vaccines being dangerous.
[01:43:06.294 --> 01:43:11.376]  But you see, everybody fluttering around trying to get Jenny McCarthy and people, she's pretty nice.
[01:43:12.336 --> 01:43:14.317]  To get behind exposing vaccines for you.
[01:43:14.497 --> 01:43:16.518]  You need to do it yourself at City Council.
[01:43:16.818 --> 01:43:18.618]  You need to do it by showing people what's on the insert.
[01:43:18.938 --> 01:43:20.759]  You're more important than the celebrities.
[01:43:21.159 --> 01:43:24.640]  People don't want to hear what the damn celebrities have to say.
[01:43:25.661 --> 01:43:28.762]  This whole broadcast is about not being in that orbit.
[01:43:32.203 --> 01:43:40.306]  We're about changing the world, bringing the power structures out of LA, out of New York, and returning it back to the people.
[01:43:41.530 --> 01:43:48.873]  The globalists control everybody by these big images and then you gotta go through them and you're nobody because you're not Robert De Niro or you're not any of these people.
[01:43:49.173 --> 01:43:53.194]  Trump said in the speech it's about you and the power going back to you and what you do.
[01:43:53.274 --> 01:43:54.255]  You're the rock stars.
[01:43:54.335 --> 01:43:55.035]  You're the power.
[01:43:55.795 --> 01:44:00.337]  Start acting like it instead of being demoralized TV heads that walk around drooling all day.
[01:44:02.858 --> 01:44:08.846]  It's a total luxury to just care less about status and care less about what your dumb neighbors that are into status think.
[01:44:09.247 --> 01:44:11.550]  You want to drive a nice car because it's reliable and fun to drive.
[01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:13.533]  You want a pool because it's fun for your kids to swim in.
[01:44:13.853 --> 01:44:17.178]  You want to, you know, fly first class if your back's hurt, that's fine.
[01:44:17.398 --> 01:44:19.781]  But it's not about being a peacock up in a tree.
[01:44:21.749 --> 01:44:23.910]  It's not about flapping your feathers around all day.
[01:44:23.930 --> 01:44:25.270]  It's about what you actually stand for.
[01:44:25.730 --> 01:44:31.611]  So I find it disgusting that he goes on all these shows and calls for violence against Trump, says he wants to punch him in the nose, over and over again.
[01:44:31.631 --> 01:44:32.592]  You're a coward!
[01:44:32.892 --> 01:44:34.572]  You're a wimp, Robert De Niro!
[01:44:34.592 --> 01:44:37.153]  I mean, you're such a piece of crap!
[01:44:38.633 --> 01:44:38.933]  Filth!
[01:44:40.033 --> 01:44:43.754]  Anyways, go ahead, because, you know, it's sick.
[01:44:43.774 --> 01:44:46.155]  Why don't you stand up for the kids instead of just running your mouth?
[01:44:47.555 --> 01:44:48.655]  Go ahead, dude.
[01:44:48.735 --> 01:44:50.656]  Did everything go according to how I said it would go?
[01:44:51.806 --> 01:44:53.406]  Well, let me tell you what happened.
[01:44:53.606 --> 01:44:56.347]  Once we got our questions in there... You guys got it on internal mic.
[01:44:56.667 --> 01:44:57.967]  Change it over until you go on external.
[01:44:58.228 --> 01:45:00.728]  Or you're gonna... It's echoing with audio.
[01:45:01.228 --> 01:45:01.688]  It's best without.
[01:45:01.708 --> 01:45:02.389]  I'll come back to you in a minute.
[01:45:02.749 --> 01:45:03.369]  I don't care!
[01:45:03.589 --> 01:45:05.809]  Why is my show even talking about Robert De Niro?
[01:45:06.069 --> 01:45:06.510]  God!
[01:45:07.850 --> 01:45:10.350]  Every time people want to go cover celebrities, it's pointless!
[01:45:11.031 --> 01:45:18.352]  Unless it's like somebody, because they're interesting and smart, like... I don't know, somebody like Ted Nugent or somebody like Jesse James.
[01:45:19.193 --> 01:45:19.953]  Anyways, I'm sorry.
[01:45:20.013 --> 01:45:20.533]  Go ahead, Rob.
[01:45:22.096 --> 01:45:23.738]  He said it was echoing and he didn't want to hear it.
[01:45:23.838 --> 01:45:24.518]  It's fine, yeah.
[01:45:24.598 --> 01:45:25.119]  It doesn't matter.
[01:45:25.139 --> 01:45:26.620]  Y'all have something on there that's echoing.
[01:45:27.061 --> 01:45:27.361]  Go ahead.
[01:45:27.401 --> 01:45:28.021]  It's echoing in his ear.
[01:45:28.902 --> 01:45:29.183]  Oh, we're done.
[01:45:29.203 --> 01:45:29.523]  Can you hear me?
[01:45:29.563 --> 01:45:30.163]  We're done, we're done.
[01:45:30.364 --> 01:45:31.164]  Thank you, appreciate it.
[01:45:31.525 --> 01:45:32.325]  Anyways, there you go.
[01:45:33.927 --> 01:45:35.588]  This is what this country has turned into.
[01:45:37.090 --> 01:45:38.811]  God, I hate celebrities.
[01:45:38.851 --> 01:45:40.113]  I just can't stand them at all.
[01:45:40.153 --> 01:45:45.698]  I may not be able to broadcast anymore just thinking about that little wimp Robert De Niro hopping around acting tough all day.
[01:45:49.417 --> 01:45:51.219]  And just over and over again, nobody listens to me.
[01:45:51.299 --> 01:45:52.520]  Nobody ever cares what I have to say.
[01:45:52.540 --> 01:45:55.222]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:45:56.784 --> 01:45:59.446]  All these traitors and all these enemies and all this scum everywhere.
[01:45:59.486 --> 01:46:01.088]  I am just so sick of it.
[01:46:05.912 --> 01:46:06.533]  Oh, God.
[01:46:07.393 --> 01:46:11.137]  The sooner Hollywood completely collapses and that whole pedophile palace goes down, the better.
[01:46:14.156 --> 01:46:17.117]  I just don't get how they all have echo audio and then they can't even hear me when I'm talking to them.
[01:46:17.377 --> 01:46:18.037]  Get them back on.
[01:46:18.057 --> 01:46:21.418]  I want everybody to hear what I told you was going to happen and what ended up happening because it's fun.
[01:46:21.678 --> 01:46:22.378]  It's educational.
[01:46:23.879 --> 01:46:25.499]  Look at him up on the screen there.
[01:46:26.279 --> 01:46:27.340]  I'm not mad at you, folks.
[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:28.200]  I'm not mad at anybody.
[01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:29.180]  This is just real.
[01:46:29.220 --> 01:46:30.160]  This isn't a teleprompter.
[01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:30.921]  This isn't a game.
[01:46:31.441 --> 01:46:33.781]  I mean, you know, it's just I'm so sick of it all.
[01:46:34.221 --> 01:46:34.922]  Can you hear me now, dude?
[01:46:35.702 --> 01:46:36.722]  Yes, I can hear you fine.
[01:46:37.022 --> 01:46:39.803]  Okay, tell folks what I told you was going to happen and what happened.
[01:46:40.902 --> 01:46:43.504]  Well, you said that he probably will not give you an interview.
[01:46:44.005 --> 01:46:49.249]  And what happened was, after the press conference ended, I actually talked to one of his media guys.
[01:46:49.269 --> 01:46:50.350]  They ushered him out.
[01:46:50.450 --> 01:46:51.951]  He did two soundbites and left.
[01:46:52.191 --> 01:46:55.994]  And I talked to, when I was talking to Robert Kennedy, we did get to sit down with him.
[01:46:56.054 --> 01:46:58.296]  And then they stalled you and said, don't worry, we'll give you one later.
[01:46:58.336 --> 01:46:59.417]  No, I told you specifically.
[01:46:59.497 --> 01:47:03.640]  They'll tell you they're going to give you one later because they have no respect for you just so he'd get out of there.
[01:47:04.041 --> 01:47:07.543]  And it's like we're running after a dog turd like it's God.
[01:47:07.804 --> 01:47:08.664]  That's what I can't stand.
[01:47:08.684 --> 01:47:09.065]  You understand?
[01:47:10.376 --> 01:47:10.556]  Yeah.
[01:47:10.716 --> 01:47:11.837]  Go ahead.
[01:47:12.037 --> 01:47:22.023]  And what Robert Kennedy said is the media that was there, and there wasn't a lot, but there was some media there, probably none of them would have shown up had Robert De Niro not been there to be with us.
[01:47:22.103 --> 01:47:24.004]  I get it, but then all they do is distort all of it.
[01:47:24.404 --> 01:47:24.925]  I don't even care.
[01:47:25.225 --> 01:47:26.866]  You understand how much I hate celebrities, right?
[01:47:27.726 --> 01:47:28.307]  Oh, no, I know.
[01:47:31.015 --> 01:47:32.396]  It's almost my religion, but just go ahead.
[01:47:32.636 --> 01:47:33.317]  Right, right.
[01:47:33.857 --> 01:47:37.640]  Well, beyond that, the press conference I think was pretty powerful.
[01:47:37.660 --> 01:47:40.541]  There were some impassioned people that spoke about this.
[01:47:40.742 --> 01:47:49.167]  He's basically putting out a $100,000 award, Robert Kennedy is, along with Robert De Niro, for anybody who can prove that mercury does not cause damage to little kids.
[01:47:49.327 --> 01:47:52.049]  And we do have the neuron footage of how it destroys the neurons.
[01:47:52.069 --> 01:47:55.131]  It's one of the most destructive things electrochemically in the brain.
[01:47:55.171 --> 01:47:55.712]  Everybody knows it.
[01:47:56.454 --> 01:47:56.674]  Right.
[01:47:57.415 --> 01:47:58.615]  And then he went and showed the studies.
[01:47:58.655 --> 01:48:01.117]  He showed the studies that show it is toxic and bad for you.
[01:48:01.397 --> 01:48:05.399]  And then he showed the studies that prove how it's bad in vaccines.
[01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:08.001]  And then he went and showed the studies that show how it's safe and there are none.
[01:48:08.201 --> 01:48:09.462]  There are literally no studies.
[01:48:09.802 --> 01:48:19.268]  And then he showed some manufactured studies that was even a smaller pile that they kind of put together the CDC and the medical community to say that, oh, it's safe enough for vaccines, essentially.
[01:48:19.788 --> 01:48:21.069]  So he went through the hoax.
[01:48:22.070 --> 01:48:23.570]  He was a very impassioned speaker.
[01:48:23.931 --> 01:48:27.193]  When De Niro got up, he talked for literally 40 seconds.
[01:48:27.213 --> 01:48:30.875]  He said, I agree pretty much everything what Robert said and sat back down.
[01:48:31.175 --> 01:48:32.496]  But there were other speakers there.
[01:48:33.156 --> 01:48:37.879]  There's the DA of Bexar County or Bexar County in San Antonio was here.
[01:48:38.260 --> 01:48:38.780]  He spoke out.
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:40.201]  He's got two kids vaccine damage.
[01:48:40.241 --> 01:48:42.502]  So there are a lot of people speaking out about this.
[01:48:42.902 --> 01:48:45.164]  Even one of Minister Louis Farrakhan's people was here.
[01:48:45.684 --> 01:48:48.646]  And this guy's traveling all around the world and the country.
[01:48:49.358 --> 01:48:54.024]  Showing movies to people and these and these ladies, they don't know he said these poor black ladies.
[01:48:54.064 --> 01:48:57.788]  They don't know what's wrong with their kids and they see this movie and they put two and two together.
[01:48:57.828 --> 01:48:59.250]  They're picking people up that are fainting.
[01:48:59.670 --> 01:49:03.675]  They're having to you know, pick people up off the floor because they knew something was wrong.
[01:49:03.715 --> 01:49:05.778]  They knew it was the vaccines and they were told over and over again.
[01:49:05.798 --> 01:49:06.879]  No, it's not the vaccines.
[01:49:07.179 --> 01:49:11.202]  Yeah, and I apologize for getting mad at the whole Robert De Niro thing.
[01:49:11.722 --> 01:49:13.424]  It's not even the vaccine thing or him.
[01:49:13.724 --> 01:49:19.208]  I'm glad that the good side of him is exposing this because one of his kids got hurt, and that's admirable.
[01:49:19.668 --> 01:49:24.731]  But then saying he wants basically to overthrow Trump and punch him in the nose and physically attack him and all that.
[01:49:24.751 --> 01:49:25.732]  I'm just mad at Michael Moore.
[01:49:25.792 --> 01:49:28.914]  I'm mad at the whole thing, and I'm sick of the Hollywood celebrity culture.
[01:49:28.934 --> 01:49:29.775]  So I'm glad you went.
[01:49:29.795 --> 01:49:36.260]  It was a good idea to go, but as I said, to interview the activists and the people that are there that care, not about Robert De Niro.
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:38.682]  I like the fact that Robert Kennedy Jr.
[01:49:38.722 --> 01:49:41.344]  goes around fighting this because he really cares.
[01:49:41.905 --> 01:49:47.149]  My issue is that I'm just so sick of chasing after Hollywood stuff, it makes me physically sick.
[01:49:47.189 --> 01:49:47.930]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:49:48.210 --> 01:49:49.211]  So I have a little bit of repulsion.
[01:49:49.231 --> 01:49:49.892]  Sorry if I blew up.
[01:49:49.932 --> 01:49:50.712]  It wasn't about you, dude.
[01:49:51.513 --> 01:49:51.953]  No, no.
[01:49:51.973 --> 01:49:52.274]  It's fine.
[01:49:52.294 --> 01:49:53.435]  And I understand your passion, too.
[01:49:53.475 --> 01:49:56.097]  This is an issue that we've been talking about for years at InfoWars.
[01:49:56.417 --> 01:49:59.260]  It's an issue that we both have because we both have children.
[01:49:59.958 --> 01:50:05.102]  And anytime you have children in the game, it changes the dynamic, it changes the perspective.
[01:50:05.562 --> 01:50:07.723]  I was talking to the DA, Nico LaHood.
[01:50:07.923 --> 01:50:08.764]  He's got four kids.
[01:50:09.164 --> 01:50:13.527]  Two of his are vaccine damaged and two of them he didn't give vaccines to.
[01:50:13.567 --> 01:50:15.709]  I've been wanting to get Nico LaHood on.
[01:50:16.209 --> 01:50:17.410]  Was he there in Washington?
[01:50:18.066 --> 01:50:19.947]  Well yeah, he did a really great speech.
[01:50:19.987 --> 01:50:22.849]  We talked to him, actually did another interview with him.
[01:50:22.969 --> 01:50:31.534]  Well, good job getting Robert Kennedy Jr., good job getting Nico LaHood, and good job, and I'm glad you did get the thing in to him about Trump.
[01:50:31.614 --> 01:50:39.259]  And so, man, can you believe all this Jade Helm, Marshall Law stuff, and just, and more saying, install Hillary, arrest Trump, this is getting crazy.
[01:50:39.799 --> 01:50:43.082]  No, there's a lot going on, and so we all have to be vigilant, we all have to do our part.
[01:50:43.242 --> 01:50:46.385]  This is Rob Dereporting for Infowars.com, on location in Washington, D.C.
[01:50:46.405 --> 01:50:47.446]  Alright, great job, buddy.
[01:50:47.466 --> 01:50:50.769]  Can't wait to see all those HD interviews that you and Zimmerman got.
[01:50:51.249 --> 01:51:00.838]  We'll be back as I get into the open preparation for total military takeover, and the media will just say I made that up, take that out of context, and I'll show you the mainstream news I'm about to show you when we come back.
[01:51:03.940 --> 01:51:05.462]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[01:51:06.479 --> 01:51:06.539]  The
[01:51:25.501 --> 01:51:35.205]  That show that humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[01:51:35.345 --> 01:51:41.508]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[01:51:42.368 --> 01:51:44.229]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[01:51:45.230 --> 01:51:46.470]  People are falling apart.
[01:51:46.490 --> 01:51:47.491]  They're totally depressed.
[01:51:47.511 --> 01:51:48.051]  They're unhappy.
[01:51:48.631 --> 01:51:49.612]  What is going on?
[01:51:50.872 --> 01:51:54.734]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[01:51:55.970 --> 01:51:58.553]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[01:51:58.933 --> 01:52:07.863]  Today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[01:52:08.083 --> 01:52:16.412]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWarsLife products.
[01:52:17.808 --> 01:52:24.310]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[01:52:24.690 --> 01:52:28.112]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[01:52:28.152 --> 01:52:31.273]  You used the skin to cover yourself for shelter.
[01:52:31.873 --> 01:52:36.955]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[01:52:37.495 --> 01:52:40.637]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com.
[01:52:40.937 --> 01:52:51.342]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, tumeric roots, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[01:52:51.462 --> 01:52:52.923]  The bone is so amazing.
[01:52:53.323 --> 01:52:58.926]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[01:53:00.046 --> 01:53:02.968]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[01:53:03.508 --> 01:53:08.951]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[01:53:09.231 --> 01:53:18.717]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[01:53:18.977 --> 01:53:23.540]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:25.560]  This is a absolute win-win.
[01:53:25.620 --> 01:53:28.401]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
[01:53:28.681 --> 01:53:34.803]  You support InfoWars and all we're doing to promote freedom and the restoration of our Republic and promotion of freedom worldwide.
[01:53:36.083 --> 01:53:44.845]  The journey towards better health and giving our bodies these amazing compounds that God created starts at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:53:44.985 --> 01:53:49.386]  Three years in the making, incredible research, and the very best ingredients.
[01:53:49.906 --> 01:53:52.527]  I'm Alex Jones, and I may not be a caveman,
[01:53:53.237 --> 01:53:56.519]  But compared to these trendies out there in the street, I'm as close as it gets.
[01:53:56.899 --> 01:54:00.321]  Join me at InfoWarsLive.com and get your caveman formula today.
[01:54:17.284 --> 01:54:22.568]  He's taking these shots, this antagonism is taunting to the intelligence community.
[01:54:22.788 --> 01:54:27.391]  You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[01:54:27.931 --> 01:54:33.575]  So even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do this.
[01:54:33.775 --> 01:54:36.537]  What do you think the intelligence community would do if they were mugged?
[01:54:36.577 --> 01:54:37.258]  I don't know, but I...
[01:54:38.820 --> 01:54:43.924]  ...told they are very upset with how he has treated them and talked about them.
[01:54:44.324 --> 01:54:46.166]  And we need the intelligence community.
[01:54:46.206 --> 01:54:48.127]  We don't know what's... Look at the Russian hacking!
[01:54:48.928 --> 01:54:52.270]  Without the intelligence community, we wouldn't have, uh, discovered it.
[01:54:52.951 --> 01:54:54.532]  Look at that creepy enemy of this country.
[01:54:54.652 --> 01:54:56.534]  I mean, Schumer is just the worst.
[01:54:57.474 --> 01:54:59.116]  What a slimy piece of crap.
[01:55:00.066 --> 01:55:01.167]  God, I'm so sick of these people.
[01:55:01.547 --> 01:55:05.830]  You know, I get mad on air sometimes and act like a jerk, and I apologize for it.
[01:55:05.850 --> 01:55:07.431]  I probably said too much about De Niro.
[01:55:07.491 --> 01:55:08.312]  He's not that bad.
[01:55:08.352 --> 01:55:10.213]  He just does some stupid, cowardly stuff.
[01:55:10.573 --> 01:55:12.174]  He does some good stuff as well, so I apologize.
[01:55:13.975 --> 01:55:22.061]  I'm in here with literally hundreds of government documents today admitting the collapse of America is planned, martial law, taking our guns.
[01:55:22.141 --> 01:55:22.881]  It's all admitted.
[01:55:23.162 --> 01:55:24.402]  It's now in mainstream news.
[01:55:25.183 --> 01:55:27.945]  And do I get any, you know, thanks that I was right?
[01:55:29.315 --> 01:55:31.900]  And exposing vaccines, exactly what they're doing with them for 20 years.
[01:55:33.102 --> 01:55:35.927]  And then, you know, De Niro's people don't want to talk to us.
[01:55:35.947 --> 01:55:37.008]  They're like, oh, that's info wars.
[01:55:37.349 --> 01:55:41.376]  When it's his people that invited us to the damn thing, using us is what makes me mad.
[01:55:42.082 --> 01:55:42.923]  That's where I got mad.
[01:55:43.023 --> 01:55:44.824]  In fact, I had to think back why I got mad.
[01:55:44.844 --> 01:55:47.787]  I just started getting mad because I realized I don't like being used.
[01:55:48.067 --> 01:55:49.108]  And I knew we were going to be used.
[01:55:49.328 --> 01:55:50.509]  But here's the thing, dummy.
[01:55:50.909 --> 01:55:52.691]  We didn't come there to film you.
[01:55:53.452 --> 01:55:54.653]  I want those activists.
[01:55:54.773 --> 01:55:56.434]  I want those real people taking action.
[01:55:56.794 --> 01:55:58.816]  I told Dew, you're not going to get to the De Niro interview.
[01:55:58.836 --> 01:56:01.078]  De Niro goes, well, now they're giving it to us at 2.
[01:56:01.238 --> 01:56:02.419]  I said, you're going to hear he left.
[01:56:02.799 --> 01:56:03.680]  They're just set you up.
[01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:04.641]  That's a classic tactic.
[01:56:04.981 --> 01:56:05.902]  And I'm right again.
[01:56:06.182 --> 01:56:07.023]  And I'm not mad at Dew.
[01:56:07.183 --> 01:56:07.944]  I'm mad at them.
[01:56:09.178 --> 01:56:14.821]  Because they're so stupid, they think we're like, worship Robert De Niro's here, oh my gosh, and all this other crap!
[01:56:16.342 --> 01:56:17.763]  Meanwhile, see I'm getting mad again, excuse me.
[01:56:18.824 --> 01:56:26.889]  Meanwhile, they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines, and all sorts of chemicals that are causing massive brain damage, and the inserts say it.
[01:56:28.410 --> 01:56:31.972]  The inserts of the flu vaccine, I showed it, says it can give you type 1 diabetes.
[01:56:33.433 --> 01:56:34.033]  They go, what do you mean?
[01:56:34.053 --> 01:56:34.613]  That's genetic.
[01:56:34.633 --> 01:56:37.115]  Yeah, if I shoot you in the head too and you bleed to death, it's genetic, you died.
[01:56:38.444 --> 01:56:39.965]  Yeah, it eats your pancreas.
[01:56:41.305 --> 01:56:42.726]  Burns it out, the non-immune result.
[01:56:44.927 --> 01:56:50.689]  And every year, people I know are like, oh my kid suddenly got type 1, nobody had it in the family, we eat healthy, what's going on?
[01:56:51.069 --> 01:56:52.830]  Did you take a vaccine, they had a big fever and stuff?
[01:56:53.330 --> 01:56:57.191]  Funny that happened a few weeks before, and then they were real sick and their sugar was up, yeah.
[01:56:57.271 --> 01:57:03.594]  I mean, I knew that 10 years ago, now diabetes linked to the flu.
[01:57:04.734 --> 01:57:06.235]  But it's the flu vaccine.
[01:57:09.099 --> 01:57:10.419]  And it's on the insert.
[01:57:11.020 --> 01:57:12.940]  But I'm a big evil conspiracy theorist.
[01:57:12.980 --> 01:57:16.321]  By the way, earlier I said, hey guys, I'm going to drink some of it on air.
[01:57:16.341 --> 01:57:21.843]  Will you make me some of the new Caveman formula that's going to be the total game changer at Infowarslife.com?
[01:57:21.863 --> 01:57:23.784]  Somebody just kind of put a scoop in it and stirred it up a little bit.
[01:57:23.804 --> 01:57:26.985]  I was like, that doesn't taste as good as it usually does, because it was only like a half scoop.
[01:57:28.285 --> 01:57:32.267]  You're supposed to shake it up in one of those little plastic shakers that you get for, you know, energy.
[01:57:33.194 --> 01:57:35.555]  Drinks or protein drinks.
[01:57:35.855 --> 01:57:37.695]  And here's a little protein shaker of your TV viewer.
[01:57:37.976 --> 01:57:39.396]  You pour that in on a couple of ice cubes.
[01:57:39.836 --> 01:57:43.777]  And folks, it tastes, when it's creamy and thick, I think better than Ovaltine.
[01:57:44.698 --> 01:57:47.659]  And it has got all the bone broth and so much more.
[01:57:48.686 --> 01:57:52.467]  This is why the ancients, they believed, had such better bones and were so much healthier.
[01:57:52.487 --> 01:57:53.007]  You can look it up.
[01:57:53.287 --> 01:57:55.968]  People they've dug up from 10,000 years ago were twice as strong as we are.
[01:57:56.308 --> 01:57:57.048]  Here's Daily Mail.
[01:57:57.308 --> 01:58:03.310]  How modern humans have become weaklings compared to our ancient ancestors who could outrun and outlive today's top athletes.
[01:58:03.970 --> 01:58:04.570]  Here's another one.
[01:58:04.870 --> 01:58:09.531]  Human intelligence peaked thousands of years ago and we've been at an intellectual and emotional decline ever since.
[01:58:09.711 --> 01:58:10.672]  Why are we getting so weak?
[01:58:11.012 --> 01:58:13.372]  Prehistoric humans were far smarter than previously assumed.
[01:58:14.312 --> 01:58:16.213]  Modern men are wimps, according to a new book.
[01:58:17.731 --> 01:58:19.632]  And it goes on and on and on.
[01:58:19.892 --> 01:58:20.472]  Think fast.
[01:58:20.512 --> 01:58:21.492]  We are really getting dumber.
[01:58:22.153 --> 01:58:22.493]  Forbes.
[01:58:23.333 --> 01:58:24.113]  People getting dumber.
[01:58:24.133 --> 01:58:27.234]  And they figured out one of the big keys is we're indoors all day.
[01:58:27.254 --> 01:58:27.835]  We're not outside.
[01:58:27.875 --> 01:58:28.455]  That's basic.
[01:58:28.875 --> 01:58:33.977]  But we're not competing, and we're not getting what humans always thought was key, the bone broth.
[01:58:34.537 --> 01:58:36.137]  Well, now it's the next level of that.
[01:58:36.297 --> 01:58:40.239]  It's Caveman, the ultimate paleo, at m4warslife.com.
[01:58:44.767 --> 01:58:46.368]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.388 --> 01:58:47.309]  It's better than Ovaltune.
[01:58:48.269 --> 01:58:50.751]  It's like... I've never had a mix that's that good.
[01:58:50.791 --> 01:58:52.872]  This is like... This is like a chocolate shake.

[01:59:55.106 --> 02:00:01.008]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:14.688 --> 02:00:16.289]  You found it.
[02:00:16.309 --> 02:00:18.550]  The front lines of the human awakening.
[02:00:18.930 --> 02:00:20.752]  It's the Infowar.
[02:00:21.012 --> 02:00:24.274]  And now, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.334 --> 02:00:26.355]  Now the Infowar's changed the world.
[02:00:26.415 --> 02:00:33.619]  Okay, Buckley, in about 80 seconds, since the last break, came out of his office, they set a chair up, he came in here, he's on air, my cousin, and, uh...
[02:00:34.997 --> 02:00:39.120]  I said, hey, I need a glass of Caveman, because I'm going to take it on air over at Products.
[02:00:39.180 --> 02:00:43.262]  And I'm not knocking who did it, so I just kind of put like a tiny scoop, and it was kind of some half-warm water.
[02:00:43.923 --> 02:00:45.443]  And I said, oh, no, I like it on ice.
[02:00:46.884 --> 02:00:55.470]  But I never thought to put it, because in one of these protein shake shakers that Buckley has, and so he shook it up and gave me one.
[02:00:55.490 --> 02:01:01.713]  He said, try this, because I said it tastes like Ovaltine, and it's really good, and it's the bone broth formula and more.
[02:01:05.100 --> 02:01:07.483]  He shook it up the way he did it with this.
[02:01:07.844 --> 02:01:11.368]  You could freeze this and this would be better than like Blue Bell chocolate ice cream.
[02:01:14.993 --> 02:01:15.794]  It's all natural.
[02:01:17.056 --> 02:01:17.777]  It's unbelievable.
[02:01:18.357 --> 02:01:20.240]  And I haven't even really rolled this out yet, folks.
[02:01:21.383 --> 02:01:23.303]  The ancients cooked the bones.
[02:01:23.784 --> 02:01:25.404]  They were obsessed with the bones, the broth.
[02:01:25.664 --> 02:01:26.324]  They busted them open.
[02:01:26.364 --> 02:01:28.025]  They ate the marrow.
[02:01:28.465 --> 02:01:30.065]  Anybody ever been to a French steakhouse?
[02:01:30.105 --> 02:01:31.606]  You eat the marrow and it's open, so delicious.
[02:01:32.026 --> 02:01:32.226]  Yes.
[02:01:32.626 --> 02:01:33.526]  That's what this has.
[02:01:33.906 --> 02:01:38.447]  And Caveman is just over the top what it does for your stamina, your bones, your ligaments.
[02:01:38.747 --> 02:01:39.588]  It's got the collagen.
[02:01:39.648 --> 02:01:40.728]  It's got everything in it.
[02:01:41.208 --> 02:01:42.228]  The true life essence.
[02:01:43.548 --> 02:01:44.989]  And it's got on top of that,
[02:01:45.939 --> 02:01:52.744]  The turmeric root, the ultimate antioxidant, and seven other primal superfoods like the chonga mushroom.
[02:01:53.384 --> 02:01:56.526]  But again, this thing doesn't have additives.
[02:01:56.546 --> 02:01:58.167]  It doesn't have flavoring.
[02:01:58.187 --> 02:02:00.009]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:02:01.616 --> 02:02:20.775]  How this all comes together and tastes so sweet and so good, but I guess the chicken broth and the multi-collagen complex blend and the stevia and the alfalfa herb and the stevia is all the sweetening, the mushroom powder, the bee pollen, the turmeric.
[02:02:21.896 --> 02:02:23.056]  And so many other things in here.
[02:02:23.156 --> 02:02:24.837]  It's just the most delicious thing I've ever tasted.
[02:02:25.097 --> 02:02:26.397]  And I'm honest.
[02:02:26.417 --> 02:02:29.557]  Like with the fruit punch, I go, yeah, I kind of like this flavor better than that.
[02:02:29.617 --> 02:02:31.278]  You know, it's not perfect, but it's really good for you.
[02:02:31.698 --> 02:02:37.779]  With this, this is literally better than like a Wendy's Frosty, which is one of my favorites.
[02:02:37.799 --> 02:02:38.659]  It's total junk food.
[02:02:38.939 --> 02:02:40.239]  This tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.
[02:02:40.299 --> 02:02:41.280]  What in the world?
[02:02:41.780 --> 02:02:44.940]  So folks know, this tastes pretty good the way I stir it up.
[02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:46.240]  How does it taste so good here?
[02:02:46.641 --> 02:02:48.661]  Because it's been shaken up with oxygen or what's going on?
[02:02:49.201 --> 02:02:49.641]  I'm not sure.
[02:02:49.661 --> 02:02:59.984]  I mean, I've been taking the bone broth, the caveman bone broth formula for about a month and a half now because we got some before we ordered the big batch that we were testing a bunch of different versions of it.
[02:03:00.004 --> 02:03:00.984]  Everybody ran off with it.
[02:03:01.144 --> 02:03:02.264]  Q said it's the best thing ever.
[02:03:02.384 --> 02:03:03.285]  Everybody's trying it.
[02:03:03.805 --> 02:03:06.005]  I try it and like it, but the way you do it with ice.
[02:03:06.105 --> 02:03:15.768]  We tried some different flavors and basically what I do is I try to mix it with milk and I just mix it really, really hard and it kind of foams up and it almost tastes like a milkshake.
[02:03:15.808 --> 02:03:16.628]  I mean, it really is.
[02:03:17.148 --> 02:03:19.169]  That's why this tastes so much better than when I do it at home.
[02:03:19.669 --> 02:03:20.509]  This has milk in it.
[02:03:20.809 --> 02:03:21.390]  It does have milk.
[02:03:21.510 --> 02:03:23.350]  Okay, well then great.
[02:03:23.410 --> 02:03:23.750]  It's fine.
[02:03:23.770 --> 02:03:25.111]  Literally, this is teleprompter free.
[02:03:25.331 --> 02:03:31.733]  I was like, whoa, it tastes like Ovaltine, like good before, but you still gotta taste the minerals and stuff.
[02:03:32.053 --> 02:03:35.114]  But now with the milk, that's why it tastes like the best milkshake ever.
[02:03:35.175 --> 02:03:35.655]  Okay, there you go.
[02:03:35.835 --> 02:03:36.595]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:03:37.195 --> 02:03:38.736]  That's the way I make it is with milk.
[02:03:38.796 --> 02:03:41.057]  And let me tell you, I'm 42 years old.
[02:03:41.097 --> 02:03:43.558]  I'm almost a year younger than Alex.
[02:03:44.938 --> 02:03:52.381]  I've been trying to stay healthy and trying to work out as much as I can and these days I try to hit the gym if I can like five times a week and I do some pretty brutal workouts.
[02:03:53.102 --> 02:04:01.325]  And what Caveman has done for me is that beyond the soreness that I feel in my muscles, I always feel this soreness in my joints after I lift.
[02:04:01.425 --> 02:04:02.066]  I have that now too.
[02:04:02.106 --> 02:04:02.786]  Something intense.
[02:04:02.806 --> 02:04:08.849]  When I was like 22 I could sit there and bench press 330 pounds and now I can still do it but it hurts too bad.
[02:04:09.429 --> 02:04:09.829]  Exactly.
[02:04:09.849 --> 02:04:10.670]  The caveman's been helping me.
[02:04:10.770 --> 02:04:11.070]  It does.
[02:04:11.110 --> 02:04:12.551]  The caveman alleviates that.
[02:04:12.591 --> 02:04:13.732]  I think it has something to do with it.
[02:04:13.812 --> 02:04:15.593]  I'm not a scientist, so I don't know.
[02:04:15.613 --> 02:04:16.193]  Sure, let's be clear.
[02:04:16.213 --> 02:04:18.315]  We literally... I was like, man, this tastes so good.
[02:04:18.555 --> 02:04:19.275]  How'd you mix it?
[02:04:19.315 --> 02:04:25.219]  Now I know it's the milk, but that's a great... We should add a recipe deal that it tastes even better with milk, but it already tastes great like Ovaltine.
[02:04:25.459 --> 02:04:26.680]  Like this, it tastes like a chocolate malt.
[02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:27.700]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:04:27.880 --> 02:04:30.622]  I mean, even if you mix it with water, it's really palatable.
[02:04:31.802 --> 02:04:37.905]  In fact, when we first got this stuff and we first got the formulations they were sending over, they were wretched.
[02:04:38.225 --> 02:04:45.569]  And I know people that like bone broth, but they say, I can't take that stuff because all the stuff that's on Amazon and elsewhere, it has a really
[02:04:46.309 --> 02:04:49.875]  But for whatever reason, the way we mix it with herbs and the cocoa, it tastes good.
[02:04:50.295 --> 02:04:50.756]  Absolutely.
[02:04:50.816 --> 02:04:59.449]  This is, I can say without a doubt, at least in my experience, that this is literally... This is a super home run available at Infowarslife.com and it supports the broadcast.
[02:04:59.509 --> 02:05:01.171]  Alright, all the big news straight ahead.
[02:05:01.212 --> 02:05:01.692]  Thanks Buckley.
[02:05:03.579 --> 02:05:14.910]  Billionaire leftist George Soros is calling for a cashless society to establish a world government where your every expense will be monitored.
[02:05:15.230 --> 02:05:25.360]  Meanwhile, former NSA head turned whistleblower William Binney, in an interview with Alex Jones, said the spy grid is part of a world government takeover.
[02:05:25.520 --> 02:05:30.842]  Certainly it is population control, but not just of any given country, but of the world.
[02:05:31.062 --> 02:05:32.743]  I think that's probably what they're after.
[02:05:32.783 --> 02:05:35.584]  In order to do that, they have to be able to control the people of the world.
[02:05:35.985 --> 02:05:46.809]  Now, despite assurances made by governments that the replacement of cash with a digital currency will make all our lives easier, experts and whistleblowers disagree.
[02:05:46.989 --> 02:05:51.111]  They say the cashless society is one big giant distraction.
[02:05:51.251 --> 02:05:52.792]  To cover up the real agenda,
[02:05:53.132 --> 02:05:55.616]  Of a worldwide surveillance state.
[02:05:55.876 --> 02:05:59.682]  I'm Darren McBreen and you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:06:03.595 --> 02:06:04.996]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:06:05.036 --> 02:06:06.117]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:06:06.377 --> 02:06:07.298]  Why is this so good?
[02:06:07.578 --> 02:06:12.821]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:06:12.901 --> 02:06:26.469]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:06:26.509 --> 02:06:27.890]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:06:28.810 --> 02:06:30.232]  Spreading disease around.
[02:06:30.312 --> 02:06:32.814]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:06:32.894 --> 02:06:34.175]  These are all parasites.
[02:06:34.215 --> 02:06:35.296]  Tell us about all the stuff it says.
[02:06:35.316 --> 02:06:36.377]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:06:36.678 --> 02:06:41.002]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:06:41.202 --> 02:06:44.385]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:06:44.445 --> 02:06:47.527]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:06:47.567 --> 02:06:48.568]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:06:48.628 --> 02:06:50.509]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[02:06:50.569 --> 02:06:51.589]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:06:51.609 --> 02:06:53.671]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:06:54.311 --> 02:06:57.333]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[02:06:57.593 --> 02:06:59.494]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:06:59.855 --> 02:07:01.836]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:07:03.021 --> 02:07:09.184]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[02:07:09.564 --> 02:07:12.446]  Dr. Group, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[02:07:12.726 --> 02:07:17.968]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[02:07:18.389 --> 02:07:24.372]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[02:07:24.512 --> 02:07:27.653]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[02:07:27.793 --> 02:07:29.254]  And when it runs out, you start dying?
[02:07:29.454 --> 02:07:33.598]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[02:07:33.778 --> 02:07:36.661]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[02:07:36.741 --> 02:07:38.302]  It works like an antioxidant.
[02:07:38.402 --> 02:07:41.585]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[02:07:41.865 --> 02:07:44.188]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[02:07:44.468 --> 02:07:45.429]  It's in powder form.
[02:07:45.529 --> 02:07:48.231]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[02:07:48.411 --> 02:07:49.432]  I take this.
[02:07:49.532 --> 02:07:50.814]  This is the product that I take.
[02:07:50.934 --> 02:07:52.916]  Infowarslife.com and the profit we make.
[02:07:53.716 --> 02:07:54.497]  We fight the Globals.
[02:07:54.517 --> 02:07:55.377]  We fight the New World Order.

[02:08:01.780 --> 02:08:15.868]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[02:08:16.348 --> 02:08:18.809]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:08:19.350 --> 02:08:21.631]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:24.867 --> 02:08:30.331]  I'm particularly wound up today because I just see open treason everywhere.
[02:08:31.331 --> 02:08:33.593]  I see the media calling for Trump's overthrow, his death.
[02:08:34.373 --> 02:08:36.154]  I see the self-propelled tyrant.
[02:08:38.236 --> 02:08:42.398]  Michael Moore calls for Hillary to be installed as president once Trump arrested.
[02:08:44.159 --> 02:08:46.181]  Michael Moore now claims Trump is a Russian.
[02:08:46.341 --> 02:08:48.102]  Not just a Russian agent, he's actually a Russian.
[02:08:49.643 --> 02:08:52.525]  I know one thing, you're an anti-American piece of garbage and a hypocrite.
[02:08:54.758 --> 02:08:57.779]  White House is being sabotaged by intelligence industrial complex.
[02:08:58.099 --> 02:08:59.620]  That's the leaders of the intelligence agencies.
[02:08:59.880 --> 02:09:05.662]  The Pentagon comes out and admits that Obama had a plan for them to take over the United States during a collapse.
[02:09:05.983 --> 02:09:07.923]  That's even being covered by the Intercept now.
[02:09:08.043 --> 02:09:12.245]  We're totally vindicated in triplicate, in giant spades.
[02:09:13.186 --> 02:09:23.850]  China is openly trying to manipulate the downfall of Trump, but the media just loves it and openly reports it like it's a good thing, but then says the Russians though, they're running everything too, and so they have to be destroyed.
[02:09:26.314 --> 02:09:30.978]  And meanwhile on every front, the Republicans are trying to block Trump.
[02:09:34.161 --> 02:09:39.946]  Doubts grow that GOP can repeal Obamacare.
[02:09:41.948 --> 02:09:45.632]  Handing the Democrats a big victory because the Republicans helped write the bill and they helped pass it.
[02:09:46.530 --> 02:09:48.351]  It's a big screw job, but that's what Trump does.
[02:09:48.371 --> 02:09:49.792]  Oops, sorry, executive order.
[02:09:50.152 --> 02:09:55.196]  Telling the IRS not to put the fines on people that don't have Obamacare.
[02:09:55.216 --> 02:09:56.517]  This is their private medical material.
[02:09:56.537 --> 02:09:57.877]  They don't have to sit there and put it on the form.
[02:09:58.138 --> 02:10:02.200]  So he just killed the fines from the IRS right there.
[02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:03.961]  And the media won't even tell you that.
[02:10:05.462 --> 02:10:09.985]  I mean, even the libertarians, when they put out a milquetoast article, go, oh, he dealt a blow to it.
[02:10:10.005 --> 02:10:11.707]  They're not going to take the money from you.
[02:10:11.727 --> 02:10:13.448]  No, he just killed the penalty.
[02:10:14.408 --> 02:10:15.249]  So now it's not forced.
[02:10:16.721 --> 02:10:17.682]  So see, that's why they want him dead.
[02:10:17.702 --> 02:10:19.724]  That's why they got the CIA trying to overthrow him at the top.
[02:10:20.564 --> 02:10:26.489]  Oh, but Trump's the establishment and the liberals all want the CIA they now love so much to overthrow him.
[02:10:26.850 --> 02:10:28.371]  What a group of horrible people.
[02:10:30.453 --> 02:10:32.795]  Now in bed with Lindsey Graham and John McCain.
[02:10:32.815 --> 02:10:36.298]  Boy, you people are just so unintellectual, so stupid.
[02:10:37.907 --> 02:10:47.050]  Again, nobody's talking about Chelsea's new book that calls for a global government to be run by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with her at the head of it because the book was intended to be written and is when she won.
[02:10:48.050 --> 02:10:55.832]  Hillary was supposed to win and then again this is mainstream news reporting what we told you last week that she won't be getting to run the world government now for Bill and Melinda Gates.
[02:10:57.172 --> 02:10:58.313]  I got more medical news coming up.
[02:10:58.393 --> 02:11:00.453]  Gene editing now allowed in specific circumstances.
[02:11:00.733 --> 02:11:05.895]  Oh, they've been doing it a long time but now it's being announced that it's that it's happening.
[02:11:08.089 --> 02:11:12.191]  Now, Trump comes out and says Flynn's a great guy, and the whole thing's very, very sad.
[02:11:12.211 --> 02:11:16.392]  But he wasn't specific that they mentioned it, but he didn't talk about sanctions.
[02:11:16.412 --> 02:11:18.553]  The Russians said, we'd like to talk to the President about sanctions.
[02:11:18.573 --> 02:11:21.074]  That's totally normal to ask an incoming National Security Advisor.
[02:11:21.094 --> 02:11:23.275]  The calls were set up, were known to the President.
[02:11:23.495 --> 02:11:24.516]  He made hundreds of calls.
[02:11:27.537 --> 02:11:27.817]  And now...
[02:11:29.807 --> 02:11:31.148]  They're saying he needs to be indicted.
[02:11:31.808 --> 02:11:34.629]  But Hillary, she can have the secret server and do whatever she wants.
[02:11:34.649 --> 02:11:35.870]  She can meet with Putin secretly.
[02:11:36.290 --> 02:11:38.571]  It's truly, truly amazing.
[02:11:38.912 --> 02:11:40.612]  Meanwhile, China warns U.S.
[02:11:40.672 --> 02:11:43.234]  against fresh naval patrols in the South China Sea.
[02:11:48.757 --> 02:11:51.658]  Now, joining us is Leo Homan.
[02:11:52.178 --> 02:11:54.720]  He's a writer with WorldNetDaily.com.
[02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:59.062]  He's an award-winning investigative journalist who spent 28 years of his career at daily and weekly newspapers.
[02:12:00.120 --> 02:12:13.196]  He is also managing editor of the Triangle Business Journal in Raleigh, North Carolina, and he has put out a new book and reports dealing with the invasion that is currently taking place.
[02:12:14.935 --> 02:12:15.656]  In this country.
[02:12:15.756 --> 02:12:16.556]  Stealth invasion.
[02:12:16.977 --> 02:12:18.878]  I'd say it's pretty open now that Trump's in there.
[02:12:19.238 --> 02:12:30.527]  But notice the State Department's just ignoring Trump and claiming he's a Russian agent and the courts are ignoring him and they're just saying, oh the President doesn't have the power to control our borders even though it's written there in plain black and white.
[02:12:31.087 --> 02:12:32.548]  We're seeing open rebellion.
[02:12:32.568 --> 02:12:35.210]  You saw the American people rebel against the Washington Beltway and the corruption.
[02:12:35.511 --> 02:12:36.571]  Now they're saying we don't care!
[02:12:37.432 --> 02:12:38.773]  We're going to say you're all Russians.
[02:12:39.094 --> 02:12:41.436]  It isn't America that wants lower taxes and controlled borders.
[02:12:41.796 --> 02:12:44.259]  It isn't America that wants to be great again with low taxes.
[02:12:44.639 --> 02:12:45.620]  No, it's the Russians.
[02:12:45.660 --> 02:12:49.444]  Well then, if that was true, which it isn't, then I guess I'm for the Russians then.
[02:12:49.464 --> 02:12:52.287]  Yes, they're better than the scum in Washington, but no, that's not what's happening.
[02:12:53.348 --> 02:12:56.130]  And Michael Moore again says he wants Trump overthrown, Hillary installed.
[02:12:56.571 --> 02:12:57.752]  We knew that was coming.
[02:12:58.853 --> 02:13:00.675]  And they are organizing to make a real run at us.
[02:13:02.830 --> 02:13:08.539]  And Zuckerberg and others are meeting with China, and the Washington Post says, China's scary lesson to the world, censoring internet works.
[02:13:10.261 --> 02:13:13.446]  China weighs into our election, Saudi Arabia does, but that's okay.
[02:13:14.067 --> 02:13:15.148]  When they do it, it's okay.
[02:13:16.570 --> 02:13:17.090]  It's amazing.
[02:13:17.150 --> 02:13:25.737]  All right, let's go to our guest and the book, Stealth Invasion, which again is from, I believe it's published by World Daily, wnd.com.
[02:13:27.158 --> 02:13:30.881]  Mr. Homan, thank you so much for coming on the broadcast.
[02:13:30.921 --> 02:13:31.621]  Where should we start?
[02:13:31.641 --> 02:13:33.363]  Just give people a breakdown, a boil down.
[02:13:34.043 --> 02:13:35.664]  I mean, what's really happening?
[02:13:35.684 --> 02:13:36.684]  You're an expert on this.
[02:13:37.044 --> 02:13:47.267]  All I know is I see articles every day where a rapist or a child rapist or an alleged rapist is being released or about to be released, whether they're from Mexico or Iran, wherever it is, they seem to have more rights than I do.
[02:13:47.327 --> 02:13:53.029]  I mean, I wouldn't be raping a child, but if I, you know, did, I wouldn't be released and just told to go free.
[02:13:53.049 --> 02:13:54.289]  I'm going to show some articles in a moment.
[02:13:54.609 --> 02:13:56.190]  What in the world's going on here from your research?
[02:13:56.963 --> 02:13:57.503]  Absolutely.
[02:13:57.964 --> 02:13:59.805]  Thanks for having me on today, Alex.
[02:13:59.845 --> 02:14:00.145]  You bet!
[02:14:01.065 --> 02:14:18.415]  Yeah, I started researching this back in the summer of 2014 for WorldNetDaily, and if you recall back then, Alex, the big story in the news at that time was the Central American children who were massing at our border, the U.S.-Mexican border.
[02:14:19.188 --> 02:14:29.816]  And illegal asylum seekers massing at the border, getting aid and shelter from a lot of religious institutions and left-wing community organizing groups.
[02:14:30.057 --> 02:14:32.739]  It was a public attempt to collapse our border and only 17% were actually kids.
[02:14:35.029 --> 02:14:35.750]  Absolutely.
[02:14:36.150 --> 02:14:42.194]  And so I started peeling back the layers on that, and it led me to some other challenges.
[02:14:42.514 --> 02:14:58.944]  That was illegal immigration, but I started looking at a larger segment of the pie that nobody was talking about in the conservative, liberal, or establishment media, and that is the bigger piece being legal immigration.
[02:14:59.554 --> 02:15:10.379]  And as I started peeling back the layers of our legal immigration system, I was finding that we're issuing 1.3 million green cards every year.
[02:15:10.399 --> 02:15:17.762]  About 130,000 of those are coming from nations that hate us and absolutely despise our values.
[02:15:18.163 --> 02:15:20.384]  Well, that's what Phil Haney talks about.
[02:15:20.404 --> 02:15:27.627]  He watches people come in, get the cards, go back to Pakistan, back to Saudi Arabia, and then come back and then watches them leave and blow stuff up.
[02:15:28.507 --> 02:15:29.007]  Exactly.
[02:15:29.047 --> 02:15:29.628]  It's crazy.
[02:15:30.108 --> 02:15:34.050]  And that's just the permanent lawful residence.
[02:15:34.110 --> 02:15:34.990]  Green card holders.
[02:15:35.010 --> 02:15:36.391]  $130,000 a year.
[02:15:36.791 --> 02:15:40.573]  Then I started looking at visas and our myriad visa programs.
[02:15:40.993 --> 02:15:47.636]  And I found we had all kinds of avenues for more people to come in from Middle Eastern and North African countries that hate us.
[02:15:48.157 --> 02:15:50.097]  They can come in on fiancÃ© visas.
[02:15:50.138 --> 02:15:52.999]  They can come in on various types of work visas.
[02:15:53.039 --> 02:15:57.101]  They can come in on entrepreneurial visas and run your local convenience store.
[02:15:57.561 --> 02:16:11.917]  They can come in on preacher visas, you know, the R1 religious visa in which we invite thousands every year to come join us here in America from some of the most dastardly places on earth for radical Islam.
[02:16:12.458 --> 02:16:25.825]  People who have obtained their degrees in Sharia law from Al-Azhar University in Cairo or some other university in Saudi Arabia, they have no respect or inkling about what American values stand for.
[02:16:25.865 --> 02:16:28.666]  The First Amendment, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, what's that?
[02:16:29.107 --> 02:16:33.369]  We're used to Sharia law and these are the type of people we're inviting in.
[02:16:33.829 --> 02:16:40.633]  What do you think the master plan is with the government covering up the stealth invasion and then acting like Trump's insane because he doesn't want to commit suicide?
[02:16:40.653 --> 02:16:41.653]  I mean, I saw a big poll.
[02:16:42.033 --> 02:16:57.081]  Two out of three Germans hate Merkel, but she's able to manipulate things and stay in office as she floods them with three million jihadis, 80% military-age men, so many rape stories a day, and then they just, they'll let them off for raping six-year-old kids with like a week in jail.
[02:16:57.181 --> 02:17:00.523]  I mean, it's like, what is this worship of the most unwashed
[02:17:01.514 --> 02:17:03.475]  Out of control, barbarous people.
[02:17:03.495 --> 02:17:07.497]  I mean, I talked about J-Lo wanting open borders at the Grammys.
[02:17:07.997 --> 02:17:10.939]  And I said, lady, go to Somalia for five minutes, you're going to be gang raped.
[02:17:11.279 --> 02:17:12.960]  The media said that I wanted her gang raped.
[02:17:13.040 --> 02:17:13.560]  No, I didn't.
[02:17:13.940 --> 02:17:16.802]  I said, go to Somalia where women are sold on slave blocks.
[02:17:17.142 --> 02:17:20.964]  What other, like three or four Muslim countries still sell women as slaves, right?
[02:17:21.184 --> 02:17:22.925]  I mean, I know ISIS is selling female slaves.
[02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:24.920]  Oh yeah.
[02:17:25.561 --> 02:17:26.561]  And you mentioned Europe.
[02:17:26.861 --> 02:17:29.903]  I have a whole chapter in my book, Stealth Invasion, on Europe.
[02:17:30.323 --> 02:17:39.647]  And the basic premise is, here we have a model, a real living model of our future, right before us, in the news every day.
[02:17:39.707 --> 02:17:42.368]  If you want to find out what's going on, read about Germany.
[02:17:43.001 --> 02:17:46.122]  Read about France, Belgium, Sweden.
[02:17:46.262 --> 02:17:50.243]  You know, Sweden was the world's most peaceful country a couple of decades ago.
[02:17:50.323 --> 02:17:55.304]  Now it's the rape capital of Europe, and it's number two worldwide in rapes per capita.
[02:17:55.344 --> 02:17:55.985]  And why is that?
[02:17:56.565 --> 02:18:04.367]  Because in these orthodox Islam countries, a woman can be raped if she's unattended or not covered up, and then she's the one that gets charged for the sexual crime.
[02:18:05.236 --> 02:18:07.038]  That's the point, Alex.
[02:18:07.398 --> 02:18:10.882]  These refugees are coming here, and we're so-called screening them.
[02:18:10.922 --> 02:18:12.964]  If you listen to the talking points of the U.S.
[02:18:12.984 --> 02:18:20.332]  State Department, John Kerry, President Obama, and all of the hacks in between, their talking points are very consistent.
[02:18:20.712 --> 02:18:27.717]  They always say that these are the most vetted, most scrutinized individuals of all immigrant types coming into the United States.
[02:18:28.197 --> 02:18:28.878]  Hogwash.
[02:18:29.098 --> 02:18:32.620]  But I do give them credit for consistency and sticking to their talking points.
[02:18:33.021 --> 02:18:36.643]  The truth is, these folks are coming here with a lot of baggage.
[02:18:36.843 --> 02:18:37.824]  Sure, I mean, what about Comey?
[02:18:37.844 --> 02:18:38.825]  I'm not going to play the whole clip again.
[02:18:39.125 --> 02:18:43.047]  He, love him or hate him, he at least did tell the truth and say, we're not vetting anything.
[02:18:43.087 --> 02:18:43.708]  There's no vetting.
[02:18:44.321 --> 02:18:44.662]  He did.
[02:18:44.962 --> 02:18:46.984]  He came out and said there's nothing to vet against.
[02:18:47.245 --> 02:18:51.990]  People in Somalia, the government of Somalia... They just issue stuff you can get in the Cracker Jack box!
[02:18:53.112 --> 02:18:53.532]  Exactly.
[02:18:53.572 --> 02:18:56.295]  We don't even know who these people are who say they're Syrians.
[02:18:56.356 --> 02:18:59.079]  You can buy a Syrian passport on the black market for $100.
[02:19:00.700 --> 02:19:01.741]  And same with Somalia.
[02:19:01.781 --> 02:19:03.001]  These are broken countries.
[02:19:03.061 --> 02:19:06.143]  They have no law enforcement data against which we can vet.
[02:19:07.263 --> 02:19:08.424]  And Comey said this.
[02:19:08.484 --> 02:19:09.004]  And guess what?
[02:19:09.044 --> 02:19:14.507]  I had an article just last week about a State Department insider who just retired a couple of months ago.
[02:19:14.527 --> 02:19:16.368]  25 years in the State Department.
[02:19:16.648 --> 02:19:23.271]  The majority of those years she served as a refugee coordinator on the ground in the Middle East, Europe, Russia, Cairo.
[02:19:23.831 --> 02:19:26.573]  And she visited these UN refugee camps.
[02:19:26.613 --> 02:19:29.174]  And by the way, the UN picks all of our refugees that were
[02:19:29.534 --> 02:19:29.914]  That's right.
[02:19:29.954 --> 02:19:31.135]  That's why your book is so important.
[02:19:31.155 --> 02:19:36.457]  You document that it's the UN picks who we then accept putting us under UN control.
[02:19:36.477 --> 02:19:41.680]  I want to come back and talk about that and have you on for a full hour in the near future because this is so important.
[02:19:41.880 --> 02:19:45.001]  The book is absolutely critical for people to understand.
[02:19:45.281 --> 02:19:52.405]  And I've even got mainstream news clips admitting, and we can play some of those I guess when we come back, but everybody knows it, that it's just all lies.
[02:19:52.445 --> 02:19:53.585]  They're not vetting.
[02:19:53.605 --> 02:19:54.846]  They've got fake passports.
[02:19:55.506 --> 02:19:56.669]  I'm gonna ask you when we come back.
[02:19:56.849 --> 02:19:58.232]  What do you think the plan is?
[02:19:58.653 --> 02:20:00.798]  What are they gonna do when more of these people kill people?
[02:20:08.015 --> 02:20:17.560]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[02:20:18.581 --> 02:20:20.402]  And so I get questions all the time over the years.
[02:20:21.182 --> 02:20:26.906]  Why don't you sell body armor at InfoWarsStore.com or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[02:20:27.626 --> 02:20:28.267]  And it's simple.
[02:20:28.867 --> 02:20:33.971]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[02:20:34.411 --> 02:20:35.452]  And there's a nexus point.
[02:20:35.492 --> 02:20:38.294]  There's quality versus price.
[02:20:38.314 --> 02:20:40.236]  And those two points have to come together.
[02:20:40.836 --> 02:20:53.806]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor, has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people
[02:20:55.177 --> 02:20:57.279]  The true next generation in body armor.
[02:20:58.140 --> 02:21:05.126]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[02:21:05.926 --> 02:21:08.709]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[02:21:08.749 --> 02:21:11.151]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[02:21:11.191 --> 02:21:15.194]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[02:21:15.635 --> 02:21:16.435]  Well, believe me,
[02:21:17.516 --> 02:21:20.198]  This is disruptive to tyrants worldwide.
[02:21:20.799 --> 02:21:31.207]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[02:21:31.848 --> 02:21:33.469]  It's nanotube technology.
[02:21:34.069 --> 02:21:35.611]  It's created here in Texas.
[02:21:36.231 --> 02:21:43.277]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[02:21:44.037 --> 02:21:46.398]  We've went out and did some testing.
[02:21:46.838 --> 02:21:49.159]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[02:21:49.179 --> 02:21:55.662]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible could be so strong.
[02:21:55.882 --> 02:22:09.168]  So what we did is we went out, we used different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[02:22:09.548 --> 02:22:10.369]  Born in Texas.
[02:22:10.729 --> 02:22:11.630]  Made in America.
[02:22:11.890 --> 02:22:14.512]  Exclusively available at InfoWareStore.com right now.
[02:22:14.592 --> 02:22:15.393]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[02:22:15.433 --> 02:22:16.373]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[02:22:16.754 --> 02:22:18.075]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[02:22:18.115 --> 02:22:18.735]  It's waterproof.
[02:22:18.775 --> 02:22:19.216]  You can wear it.
[02:22:19.256 --> 02:22:19.836]  It's comfortable.
[02:22:19.916 --> 02:22:20.697]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[02:22:20.737 --> 02:22:23.039]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[02:22:23.519 --> 02:22:31.125]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[02:22:31.805 --> 02:22:35.470]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[02:22:35.490 --> 02:22:42.318]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[02:22:42.338 --> 02:22:43.539]  What did they really say about this?
[02:22:43.579 --> 02:22:44.700]  No, this is through the roof.
[02:22:44.880 --> 02:22:47.624]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[02:22:48.465 --> 02:22:52.228]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing.
[02:22:52.348 --> 02:22:56.453]  Because they're wearing these big, heavy, bulky vests that don't work as well.
[02:22:56.933 --> 02:23:01.958]  So they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[02:23:02.058 --> 02:23:09.466]  And 90, I mean you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in official crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[02:23:09.486 --> 02:23:10.707]  This stops that unless it's a slug.
[02:23:11.147 --> 02:23:12.288]  I mean, that's amazing.
[02:23:12.328 --> 02:23:15.549]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[02:23:15.809 --> 02:23:17.070]  And soon, they won't have it.
[02:23:17.430 --> 02:23:21.832]  If it's available to civilians who are not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[02:23:21.992 --> 02:23:26.074]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[02:23:26.855 --> 02:23:30.196]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[02:23:30.216 --> 02:23:30.977]  People didn't believe in it.
[02:23:31.297 --> 02:23:32.317]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[02:23:32.377 --> 02:23:34.098]  I feed my horse hay.
[02:23:35.439 --> 02:23:37.520]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[02:23:40.828 --> 02:23:42.651]  And we shot everything you can imagine at it.
[02:23:43.892 --> 02:23:45.815]  Again, fund the InfoWard.
[02:23:45.915 --> 02:23:49.840]  Get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[02:23:50.341 --> 02:23:52.364]  It's a win-win.
[02:23:52.704 --> 02:23:52.364]  $200.
[02:23:52.944 --> 02:23:55.888]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWardStore.com.
[02:23:55.989 --> 02:23:56.689]  It's amazing.
[02:24:19.804 --> 02:24:23.289]  Investigative journalist Leo Homans is our guest for one more little short segment.
[02:24:23.309 --> 02:24:34.022]  Then we're going to get Dr. Steve Pchenik on to get his take on the open spy war, civil war going on in our country to say Trump's a Russian spy because his national security advisor talked to the Russians on the phone.
[02:24:34.042 --> 02:24:34.743]  That's what they do!
[02:24:35.711 --> 02:24:37.852]  But then he didn't tell them all of it, so he's gone.
[02:24:37.872 --> 02:24:38.932]  I think that's blood in the water.
[02:24:38.972 --> 02:24:41.673]  But, uh, stealth invasion's on.
[02:24:41.733 --> 02:24:43.113]  It's being exposed now.
[02:24:43.813 --> 02:24:46.614]  They now say the president doesn't have the power to even control anybody.
[02:24:46.654 --> 02:24:47.954]  Just come on in from Somalia.
[02:24:48.734 --> 02:24:51.335]  Which, I mean, you literally get kidnapped in five minutes if you're there.
[02:24:52.955 --> 02:24:55.076]  But, J-Lo says bring people there.
[02:24:55.096 --> 02:24:56.996]  I just said she should go there and enjoy it for herself.
[02:24:57.417 --> 02:24:58.177]  I mean, I hope she doesn't.
[02:24:58.217 --> 02:24:59.037]  She would be kidnapped.
[02:25:00.023 --> 02:25:00.443]  Absolutely.
[02:25:00.463 --> 02:25:01.363]  She'd probably be gang-raped.
[02:25:01.963 --> 02:25:03.824]  And the media then acts like I'm attacking a woman.
[02:25:03.844 --> 02:25:04.864]  They just love Islam.
[02:25:04.884 --> 02:25:05.644]  So let me ask you a question.
[02:25:06.904 --> 02:25:07.925]  Where do you think this is going?
[02:25:07.965 --> 02:25:09.525]  I know you've documented it all in your book.
[02:25:09.785 --> 02:25:15.306]  I know it's frustrating you being informed, seeing the media lying about what's really happening.
[02:25:15.886 --> 02:25:17.567]  Some people should, you know, research the information.
[02:25:17.587 --> 02:25:25.028]  But looking at the endgame, why would the globalists that already run this country in the West want to bring in a bunch of incompatible crazy people?
[02:25:26.138 --> 02:25:28.239]  That's a great question, Alex.
[02:25:28.799 --> 02:25:38.524]  In my opinion, what we see is an unholy alliance between the secular globalist left and the religious globalist Islamists.
[02:25:38.584 --> 02:25:38.964]  Exactly.
[02:25:39.782 --> 02:25:55.675]  And, you know, on the face of it, they would seem to have little in common, because, you know, you think of the secular left as being feminist and pro-woman and pro-gay rights and all that, whereas Islamists tend to not be too fond of those things.
[02:25:56.115 --> 02:26:00.379]  But if you look a little deeper, they really do have a lot in common, these two
[02:26:00.939 --> 02:26:11.160]  We have footage all over the world, Germany, the US, the leaders are Islamic women and they're actually getting women to say that women's rights is now Sharia.
[02:26:11.300 --> 02:26:12.122]  I can't even believe it.
[02:26:12.907 --> 02:26:17.188]  It's crazy, but if you look at what they share common enemies, okay?
[02:26:17.268 --> 02:26:22.949]  They both have a common hatred of Christianity and Judeo-Christian values.
[02:26:23.809 --> 02:26:26.850]  They both have a disdain for national borders.
[02:26:27.350 --> 02:26:31.131]  The Muslims, the Islamists want a global caliphate.
[02:26:31.631 --> 02:26:35.772]  The globalist secular people want a global super socialist state.
[02:26:36.352 --> 02:26:37.153]  Without borders.
[02:26:37.933 --> 02:26:42.157]  They both believe in the nanny state, sort of cradle to grave, taking care of people.
[02:26:42.677 --> 02:26:46.920]  Sharia law has those same principles in common with the socialists.
[02:26:47.421 --> 02:26:48.481]  And of course, jihad.
[02:26:48.922 --> 02:26:50.783]  On the Islamist side, you have jihad.
[02:26:51.023 --> 02:26:52.424]  You know, violent revolution.
[02:26:52.505 --> 02:26:57.989]  And the socialists, as we've seen, are now getting more and more violent and are for all for revolution.
[02:26:58.089 --> 02:27:01.511]  Revolutionary overthrow of the American system.
[02:27:01.792 --> 02:27:04.674]  They both also have a common disdain for
[02:27:05.353 --> 02:27:06.254]  Free speech.
[02:27:06.574 --> 02:27:08.997]  They are completely intolerant of free speech.
[02:27:09.037 --> 02:27:11.459]  We saw that on the campus of Berkeley last week.
[02:27:12.100 --> 02:27:19.747]  And we see it all the time, of course, in Muslim countries where you cannot speak out against Islam or Mohammed or anything that Islam says is sacred.
[02:27:20.087 --> 02:27:20.688]  It's a crime.
[02:27:20.748 --> 02:27:21.569]  You can lose your head.
[02:27:22.270 --> 02:27:31.977]  Okay, so they do have more in common than people think, and I think they'll work out these differences after they accomplish their goal of having, you know, global control.
[02:27:32.337 --> 02:27:35.799]  And why do they want to flood our countries with refugees from the third world?
[02:27:36.480 --> 02:27:50.769]  Alex, I think it's to break down society, to cause instability, divisions, and wear down our social cohesion and what's left of patriotic, nationalist Americans, hard-working, middle-class Americans.
[02:27:51.650 --> 02:27:52.391]  That's it.
[02:27:52.431 --> 02:27:52.791]  Exactly.
[02:27:52.811 --> 02:27:59.998]  They bring in the incompatible group, they control it, then they take our rights away saying we've angered them, and then we get WikiLeaks documents admitting it.
[02:28:00.018 --> 02:28:01.720]  But I can't even keep track of all the articles.
[02:28:01.960 --> 02:28:03.261]  Here's Fox 7 Austin.
[02:28:03.822 --> 02:28:07.886]  Ice detainer denied for man charged with repeatedly sexually assaulting young girl.
[02:28:08.426 --> 02:28:11.329]  I have two of these in one week from different people in Austin.
[02:28:11.569 --> 02:28:12.790]  They just say raping kids?
[02:28:12.810 --> 02:28:13.611]  Reportedly?
[02:28:13.671 --> 02:28:14.272]  You can go!
[02:28:14.712 --> 02:28:16.454]  It's like a god-like status.
[02:28:18.503 --> 02:28:27.146]  It just gets crazier and cra- and then I have like five articles out of Germany, without even looking for them today, where they're just letting people rape women, or giving them a week in jail.
[02:28:27.566 --> 02:28:39.471]  I mean, it's just like, what on- and now they're saying, we are gonna have to have days a week where women can't show their faces at swimming pools, wear burkits, like adopt- and like, don't wear short dresses, the Muslims might rape you.
[02:28:39.911 --> 02:28:45.533]  And then, you know, like the liberal mayor comes out in a German city and says, well, the women are good-looking, it's your fault.
[02:28:46.451 --> 02:28:47.812]  It's not the Muslims' fault.
[02:28:47.892 --> 02:28:48.192]  Right.
[02:28:48.472 --> 02:28:49.893]  They don't know it's illegal.
[02:28:50.013 --> 02:28:52.955]  And Alex, again, that's the harbinger.
[02:28:53.015 --> 02:28:54.976]  Ignorance of the law is no excuse.
[02:28:55.476 --> 02:28:59.719]  Germany and Sweden are our future if we don't change course and do it quickly.
[02:28:59.759 --> 02:29:02.880]  You guys reported on Twin Falls, Idaho last year.
[02:29:02.940 --> 02:29:08.203]  So did I. And if you recall, the backlash to that was furious.
[02:29:08.303 --> 02:29:16.048]  They did not want us to tell the truth about what happened there with the little five-year-old girl being sexually assaulted by the three refugee boys.
[02:29:17.448 --> 02:29:23.475]  And they were from Iraq and Sudan and they raped this... And the media said it was a hoax and then later it came out it was true.
[02:29:24.508 --> 02:29:26.049]  And they're still saying it's a hoax.
[02:29:26.249 --> 02:29:28.129]  Alex, it was fake news, they tell us.
[02:29:28.649 --> 02:29:37.912]  Yeah, and I was recently berated by a retired Supreme Court Justice in Idaho who said that myself, InfoWars, and Breitbart had it all wrong.
[02:29:37.972 --> 02:29:41.633]  We were just, you know... Everybody knows Islam loves women.
[02:29:41.953 --> 02:29:43.514]  Please come on for a full hour very soon.
[02:29:43.574 --> 02:29:46.255]  The book available at WorldNetDaily, Stealth Invasion.
[02:29:46.275 --> 02:29:47.055]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:47.375 --> 02:29:50.036]  Straight ahead, inside the coup taking place against Trump.
[02:29:52.543 --> 02:29:55.530]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:29:56.473 --> 02:29:59.159]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:04.184 --> 02:30:05.525]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:30:05.765 --> 02:30:10.568]  I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new off-the-grid products of 2017.
[02:30:10.688 --> 02:30:13.951]  And seriously, I really think everyone should have one of these.
[02:30:14.211 --> 02:30:19.574]  I'm talking about the PPX solar generator system from our friends at Solutions from Science, one of our oldest sponsors.
[02:30:20.015 --> 02:30:28.620]  The PPX is so small you can put it in your pocket, but so powerful you can run some 110 appliances at your house, like a small refrigerator, so you can keep food from spoiling.
[02:30:28.861 --> 02:30:33.964]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.
[02:30:34.204 --> 02:30:40.909]  The system provides an endless supply of off-the-grid electricity, allowing you to create your own private power grid literally anywhere in the world.
[02:30:41.189 --> 02:30:45.772]  Perfect for cabins, remote locations, anytime you need to get off the grid for a while.

[02:32:03.399 --> 02:32:14.725]  Billionaire leftist George Soros is calling for a cashless society to establish a world government where your every expense will be monitored.
[02:32:15.045 --> 02:32:25.170]  Meanwhile, former NSA head turned whistleblower William Binney, in an interview with Alex Jones, said the spy grid is part of a world government takeover.
[02:32:25.350 --> 02:32:30.673]  Certainly it is population control, but not just of any given country, but of the world.
[02:32:30.873 --> 02:32:32.554]  I think that's probably what they're after.
[02:32:32.594 --> 02:32:35.415]  In order to do that, they have to be able to control the people of the world.
[02:32:35.815 --> 02:32:46.641]  Now, despite assurances made by governments that the replacement of cash with a digital currency will make all our lives easier, experts and whistleblowers disagree.
[02:32:46.801 --> 02:32:50.943]  They say the cashless society is one big giant distraction.
[02:32:51.083 --> 02:32:52.624]  To cover up the real agenda,
[02:32:52.964 --> 02:32:55.449]  Of a worldwide surveillance state.
[02:32:55.710 --> 02:32:59.517]  I'm Darren McBreen and you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:33:16.033 --> 02:33:23.520]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[02:33:24.521 --> 02:33:28.745]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:28.885 --> 02:33:32.688]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:33:33.049 --> 02:33:34.690]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:35.371 --> 02:33:37.173]  Yep, we are commanding the Info War.
[02:33:37.253 --> 02:33:41.276]  Make no mistake, we know who the characters are, we know who the cast is, and we're fighting hard for this republic.
[02:33:42.077 --> 02:33:43.657]  We're fighting hard to get rid of Obamacare.
[02:33:43.677 --> 02:33:44.818]  We're fighting hard to cut taxes.
[02:33:44.838 --> 02:33:46.238]  We're fighting hard to secure the border.
[02:33:46.738 --> 02:33:50.198]  We're fighting hard to rebuild our military that's been debased by design.
[02:33:50.218 --> 02:33:52.279]  We're fighting hard to take care of the veterans.
[02:33:52.299 --> 02:34:01.961]  We're fighting hard to try to reduce all this partial birth abortion and garbage that's going on and give the power back to the states to begin getting that more in line with the Bill of Rights and Constitution and with repealing it.
[02:34:02.621 --> 02:34:09.382]  And we are just fighting as hard as we can to get the Federal Reserve to have policy that actually helps Main Street, not Wall Street.
[02:34:12.259 --> 02:34:14.160]  And you'd think all hell had broken loose.
[02:34:14.740 --> 02:34:20.722]  Was it the American people that ever actually elected Trump?
[02:34:20.762 --> 02:34:21.442]  It was the Russians.
[02:34:22.502 --> 02:34:25.744]  And Trump comes out and points out these leaks are illegal.
[02:34:27.164 --> 02:34:30.445]  But hasn't gone with the fact that Saudi Arabia and others openly funded Hillary.
[02:34:30.465 --> 02:34:33.466]  Because he just wants to move on and try to fix the country.
[02:34:34.206 --> 02:34:35.307]  And he knows it's laughable.
[02:34:36.089 --> 02:34:39.210]  But they're going to continue to cook it up and continue to call for his murder.
[02:34:39.790 --> 02:34:42.811]  So they're trying to push Trump into taking action, but what else can he do?
[02:34:44.271 --> 02:34:45.211]  These are arrogant people.
[02:34:45.791 --> 02:34:49.732]  And the American people back Trump.
[02:34:52.713 --> 02:34:54.853]  Now, we're getting Dr. Steve Pichinik on.
[02:34:54.993 --> 02:34:55.954]  It's been the announcement today.
[02:34:56.494 --> 02:35:00.475]  He's lined up for this time, but we're gonna try to get him on the phone right now, and they'll let me know, I guess, when that happens.
[02:35:01.655 --> 02:35:02.035]  Briefly,
[02:35:04.272 --> 02:35:18.055]  I cannot hype enough to you out there just how amazing our new product is that is way better than any other bone broth formula out there, hands down.
[02:35:19.656 --> 02:35:30.859]  Of course, all the old wives' tales in every culture say that bone broth makes you healthier and it's this great, wonderful thing and that it's so good for your collagen and it's so good for your body and it's so good for your joints and everything else.
[02:35:31.799 --> 02:35:32.459]  And this has got
[02:35:34.349 --> 02:35:35.671]  Cocoa in it to flavor it.
[02:35:35.751 --> 02:35:36.852]  It's simply delicious.
[02:35:36.892 --> 02:35:40.376]  It's available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:35:41.497 --> 02:35:42.818]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:35:43.439 --> 02:35:51.068]  And you can read about, just Google, how modern humans have become weaklings compared with our ancient ancestors who could outrun and outlive today's top athletes.
[02:35:52.608 --> 02:35:59.912]  And a lot of it is because, if you go back to the earliest humans, they would take bones of scavengers and cook them, bust them open, eat the marrow, and also grind up the bone meal.
[02:36:00.433 --> 02:36:02.554]  Of course, people used to grind up bone meal and put it in their bread.
[02:36:03.715 --> 02:36:09.238]  Everybody knows from my both late grandmothers that bone broth's great.
[02:36:09.258 --> 02:36:10.378]  It's very, very popular out there.
[02:36:10.398 --> 02:36:12.420]  There's a lot of news articles and things on it.
[02:36:12.440 --> 02:36:12.980]  You can look it up.
[02:36:13.380 --> 02:36:17.643]  But this is super concentrated, really, really strong, super high quality.
[02:36:18.871 --> 02:36:25.314]  And it's got seven other primal superfoods in it, like turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and more.
[02:36:25.534 --> 02:36:27.755]  And it supports this broadcast and what we do.
[02:36:28.416 --> 02:36:30.117]  We have the first big run of it available.
[02:36:30.617 --> 02:36:31.878]  It's available at infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:36:31.978 --> 02:36:34.879]  It's also got bee pollen in it, alfalfa, herb, stevia leaf extract.
[02:36:41.072 --> 02:36:44.973]  Goji berry powder, chonga mushroom, as I said, and a whole bunch of other ingredients.
[02:36:45.433 --> 02:36:51.054]  Read about it on the website, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:36:51.134 --> 02:36:54.354]  And it's a big canister of this stuff, but what really matters is out of the gates.
[02:36:54.374 --> 02:36:57.535]  We're discounting it 33% so that everybody gets a chance to try it.
[02:36:57.555 --> 02:37:01.836]  You can also get 10% off when you sign up for auto ship and free shipping on orders of $50 or more.
[02:37:02.216 --> 02:37:05.016]  It's not been reviewed yet because we are launching it today.
[02:37:05.576 --> 02:37:06.976]  Again, InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:37:10.919 --> 02:37:25.295]  I had the New York Times calling me, you name it, saying, how are you guys able to fund yourselves and the rest of the talk radio is falling apart because this country's been in a recession for a long time and there's so much media now and stuff's not as lucrative as just a few outlets out there like 20 years ago.
[02:37:25.696 --> 02:37:27.998]  And the answer is we sell high quality products directly to
[02:37:29.312 --> 02:37:33.073]  The you, the listener, the consumer, and we sell high quality stuff.
[02:37:33.773 --> 02:37:34.614]  So that's what's going on.
[02:37:34.894 --> 02:37:40.395]  We also have some sponsors as well, but we couldn't have an operation this big if we weren't directly supported by you.
[02:37:40.435 --> 02:37:41.836]  So you're what's making it possible.
[02:37:42.256 --> 02:37:44.456]  You have my commitment to bring you the very best products we can.
[02:37:45.037 --> 02:37:49.478]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:37:49.838 --> 02:37:51.759]  I appreciate him coming on on short notice.
[02:37:51.799 --> 02:37:52.719]  I have not talked to him.
[02:37:53.079 --> 02:37:55.680]  I have not had time to go to his website, stevepatrinik.com.
[02:37:57.710 --> 02:37:58.671]  I do every couple days.
[02:37:59.031 --> 02:38:00.692]  I just thought this morning I'd get him on.
[02:38:00.712 --> 02:38:03.193]  I don't know his view yet on what's happening, but I know.
[02:38:04.653 --> 02:38:04.913]  I know.
[02:38:05.954 --> 02:38:18.539]  Not in a bragging way, because I don't actually like knowing these people and being involved in all this stuff, but as much as I'm involved in everything, obviously, and with the big rollout under Obama, the military and the CIA being publicly involved in domestic media,
[02:38:20.689 --> 02:38:21.489]  That's what goes on.
[02:38:22.010 --> 02:38:27.192]  So people have been authorized over the years, and I think it's backfired, to actually reach out to the media.
[02:38:27.633 --> 02:38:34.836]  And so good elements of the CIA and other agencies have allowed the American people to vote and overthrow Hillary, who was going to steal it.
[02:38:34.856 --> 02:38:39.379]  I mean, Chelsea already had a book printed, how they were going to run a global health care scam and global government.
[02:38:39.419 --> 02:38:40.119]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:38:41.240 --> 02:38:49.424]  And so there has been a counter coup against the globalist coup that was just wanting to bankrupt us with Obamacare and open borders and the Islamic invasion, all the rest of it.
[02:38:50.270 --> 02:38:52.952]  That's all basically falling apart in Europe.
[02:38:53.032 --> 02:38:54.793]  Wilders is going to win in the Netherlands.
[02:38:55.254 --> 02:38:56.295]  Le Pen's going to win.
[02:38:56.555 --> 02:38:57.315]  She's way ahead.
[02:38:57.355 --> 02:38:59.097]  And there's Muslims burning Paris down.
[02:38:59.317 --> 02:39:00.738]  They won't call them Muslims on the news.
[02:39:01.218 --> 02:39:02.439]  They call it anti-police riots.
[02:39:03.680 --> 02:39:08.043]  So the point is, is that Islam has exploded over a billion plus people.
[02:39:08.584 --> 02:39:14.308]  I'm not against the average Muslim, but the radical, really, you know, provincial ones are coming in.
[02:39:14.348 --> 02:39:17.491]  They've been brought in with this weird globalist alliance between globalists
[02:39:18.291 --> 02:39:23.974]  A corporate socialist and globalist Islam who think they can coexist to take over and defeat the West.
[02:39:24.074 --> 02:39:25.535]  And it's just not going to happen.
[02:39:25.855 --> 02:39:26.776]  You can get rid of Trump.
[02:39:26.816 --> 02:39:27.376]  You can do whatever.
[02:39:27.416 --> 02:39:28.697]  The genie ain't going back in the bottle.
[02:39:28.757 --> 02:39:33.419]  And I look at Nancy Pelosi not knowing that Bush isn't president anymore in the same press conference.
[02:39:33.479 --> 02:39:38.041]  And then Waters not knowing what Aleppo is.
[02:39:38.182 --> 02:39:40.743]  And then saying the Russians have invaded Korea.
[02:39:41.123 --> 02:39:42.044]  Not even North or South.
[02:39:42.904 --> 02:39:43.965]  Folks, you watch C-SPAN.
[02:39:44.125 --> 02:39:46.306]  These people think islands float.
[02:39:47.481 --> 02:39:55.223]  So, there are a lot of smart people in the technocracy and special interests that just want to make their money, but no one's really even a central brain up there.
[02:39:55.603 --> 02:39:57.803]  I'm kind of embarrassed we can't beat these people easier.
[02:39:58.764 --> 02:40:04.585]  But they just act like a locust swarm of disinfo, and Flynn still hasn't apologized.
[02:40:04.605 --> 02:40:08.926]  He said, oh, I'm sorry, the President, I wasn't totally clear, but that's what a National Security Advisor does for my research.
[02:40:08.946 --> 02:40:12.407]  And they even tacitly admit that and say, well, this is normal to make these calls.
[02:40:13.490 --> 02:40:15.611]  What were they doing being spied on by Obama?
[02:40:15.651 --> 02:40:17.272]  So, this is huge.
[02:40:17.352 --> 02:40:20.774]  I want to ask Patrionic what his view is on this, and I want him to get to what should we do.
[02:40:20.794 --> 02:40:24.656]  Because Michael Moore and others are saying overthrow him, kill him, arrest him.
[02:40:24.976 --> 02:40:26.157]  It's all over the news.
[02:40:26.257 --> 02:40:29.179]  Every major comedian, you name it, kill him, kill him, kill him.
[02:40:30.460 --> 02:40:36.383]  This is like an organized civil war of a bunch of crazy people that don't even know what end is up.
[02:40:37.283 --> 02:40:39.605]  And there's Red Brigades marching around attacking
[02:40:40.839 --> 02:40:42.300]  Cat sanctuaries in Austin?
[02:40:42.340 --> 02:40:42.900]  It's like, what?
[02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:45.481]  I mean, these people are so nasty.
[02:40:47.122 --> 02:40:48.923]  I don't even know, I think they're insane.
[02:40:49.783 --> 02:40:53.745]  So, I'm going to ask Dr. Pchenik, who is a psychiatrist, former head of psychological warfare for different agencies.
[02:40:54.226 --> 02:40:55.186]  I know he has a lot of contacts.
[02:40:55.206 --> 02:40:57.627]  He's not doing this for an agency, but he's talked to the agencies.
[02:40:58.088 --> 02:41:00.449]  I have connections, obviously, separate from Pchenik.
[02:41:01.360 --> 02:41:12.345]  Pretty high level in the big contracting and other groups and major groups that hook into all these things and they say it's like 90% anti-globalist and that they're done.
[02:41:13.345 --> 02:41:14.086]  They're just laughing.
[02:41:15.086 --> 02:41:16.067]  I don't see this as funny.
[02:41:16.767 --> 02:41:20.749]  But the consensus is, is that if they really try to get violent, they're really going to get their ass handed to them.
[02:41:21.109 --> 02:41:21.529]  I don't know.
[02:41:21.729 --> 02:41:23.090]  I just, I am really concerned.
[02:41:23.350 --> 02:41:25.091]  Dr. Pachinik, that's like a five minute intro.
[02:41:25.151 --> 02:41:26.391]  Thanks for joining us on Short Notice.
[02:41:26.651 --> 02:41:28.812]  StevePachinik.com, co-wrote books with Tom Clancy.
[02:41:29.032 --> 02:41:30.933]  It's hard to do all your bio, it's so long.
[02:41:31.233 --> 02:41:33.935]  Co-founded Delta Force with General Boykin and others.
[02:41:34.575 --> 02:41:35.535]  What are we really looking at here?
[02:41:35.555 --> 02:41:36.716]  You heard my little breakdown.
[02:41:37.535 --> 02:41:43.483]  I think, as usual, you've articulated the emotional aspects of what's going on.
[02:41:43.583 --> 02:41:45.486]  But it's really getting out of control.
[02:41:45.586 --> 02:41:50.532]  Not with you, it's getting out of control with a lot of the comedians and the media.
[02:41:50.753 --> 02:41:54.077]  What's happening is the media can no longer understand.
[02:41:54.818 --> 02:42:00.065]  That Flynn was not intended to remain in the National Security Agency.
[02:42:00.245 --> 02:42:00.946]  That's news.
[02:42:01.586 --> 02:42:06.092]  In other words, when he was placed in there... Wait a minute, I was told that by other sources yesterday!
[02:42:06.432 --> 02:42:08.875]  Man, you really got some amazing... I wasn't... Hold on.
[02:42:09.136 --> 02:42:10.437]  I was told this was all a setup.
[02:42:10.457 --> 02:42:10.838]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:42:11.445 --> 02:42:17.731]  All right, I said it from the beginning, that we put in Flynn, but it was not intended to keep him there all the time.
[02:42:18.231 --> 02:42:22.195]  Mike Flynn is an excellent general and defense intelligence agency.
[02:42:22.615 --> 02:42:23.816]  Many do not like him.
[02:42:23.937 --> 02:42:24.517]  We knew that.
[02:42:24.998 --> 02:42:26.339]  Many do not agree with him.
[02:42:26.439 --> 02:42:27.079]  We knew that.
[02:42:27.620 --> 02:42:35.828]  At the same time, it was Flynn and Bannon and a bunch of others who were able to get Trump over the hump and into the presidency.
[02:42:36.408 --> 02:42:44.610]  Now, I wrote a blog yesterday, which you guys received, and in that blog, I simply said, Welcome to American Entrepreneurship.
[02:42:44.750 --> 02:42:49.051]  In other words, we place people in positions, then we take them out.
[02:42:49.671 --> 02:42:57.633]  The chief of staff or the chief CEO, which is what Trump is, comes in and fires, fires and fires.
[02:42:58.093 --> 02:43:03.234]  The reason why America is not used to this is America has become lazy,
[02:43:03.974 --> 02:43:07.997]  It has become surfeit, it has become non-capitalistic.
[02:43:08.197 --> 02:43:25.649]  When we put a businessman, this is the first businessman in a hundred years who we've put into the presidency, the first thing the businessman does, and he correctly does, is he fires the people who have helped him, he fires the people who have not helped him, and it's not personal.
[02:43:26.169 --> 02:43:34.815]  We have no personal stake in this other than the fact that we wanted major change in the United States, and that is what major change looks like.
[02:43:35.436 --> 02:43:37.617]  You help somebody, and then you leave.
[02:43:38.137 --> 02:43:41.800]  The chief of staff may not be the chief of staff very much longer.
[02:43:41.880 --> 02:43:42.360]  Previous.
[02:43:42.841 --> 02:43:48.585]  The person who's giving the press talk, Spicer, may not be the next chief speaker.
[02:43:49.105 --> 02:44:01.639]  And Flynn knew very well that given his personality, given the fact of how loyal he was to America and to Trump, that that was enough to get him to the position that he needed to be, and he knew he would have to leave.
[02:44:02.099 --> 02:44:03.501]  Now, what in fact happened?
[02:44:03.961 --> 02:44:08.446]  Flynn did not commit any crimes, neither did anybody in the Trump administration.
[02:44:08.866 --> 02:44:21.650]  Let me go back to when I was in the Reagan and Bush administration, when Reagan and Bush sent out individuals to Iran while I was involved with the Carter administration and they ran hostage siege.
[02:44:22.010 --> 02:44:24.531]  So if they want to impose the Logan Act,
[02:44:25.191 --> 02:44:36.176]  On Flynn or anyone else in the Trump administration, they better go back to Newt Gingrich, they better go back to Reagan and his staff, and to Bush and his staff.
[02:44:36.376 --> 02:44:38.057]  I do not think they want to do that.
[02:44:38.457 --> 02:44:45.060]  There is no violation of the Logan Act, there is no transaction that regards money.
[02:44:45.301 --> 02:44:48.542]  Sure, but what is the total attempt to overthrow Trump and the hysteria?
[02:44:48.562 --> 02:44:49.483]  You're right, it's crazy.
[02:44:49.503 --> 02:44:50.243]  Where's that coming from?
[02:44:50.848 --> 02:44:53.429]  Well, it's coming from what you said and what we talked about.
[02:44:53.669 --> 02:45:10.536]  When people are ineffectual and they have been aced out, which is what happened to Hillary, it's what happened to Bill Clinton, it's what's happened to the entire left, it happened to the Democratic Party, they didn't know how fast we were moving in and how quickly we could eviscerate them.
[02:45:10.796 --> 02:45:11.737]  They're eviscerated.
[02:45:12.017 --> 02:45:19.660]  Everything else that's occurring is nothing but a bunch of sheeps fleeing out and complaining, but it has no effect whatsoever.
[02:45:20.260 --> 02:45:45.213]  If, however, they continue to make pronouncements like the following, that Trump is crazy, which he is not, that Trump is mad, which he is not, and this is made by psychologists, then I strongly recommend that Trump and the administration file suit against the American Psychiatric, against the American Psychological Association, and against every physician who has positively stated that
[02:45:45.573 --> 02:45:53.515]  Because they're using their professional guild, their professional letters, to then project across and make a diagnosis, try to ruin someone.
[02:45:53.535 --> 02:45:55.195]  I mean, that is the definition of defamation.
[02:46:11.260 --> 02:46:13.903]  That's correct, but it's also medical malpractice.
[02:46:13.923 --> 02:46:29.720]  When I saw a group of psychologists, 30 of them, none of whom I knew, state categorically that Trump had mental illness, that was grounds for debarring them and delegitimizing their academic credentials.
[02:46:30.040 --> 02:46:42.209]  There is no reason whatsoever for anybody to make that kind of diagnosis unless they have seen Trump, they have gone and talked to him, and I would guarantee you that's not the conclusion you would come to.
[02:46:42.570 --> 02:46:54.719]  However, this kind of hysteria, which is really created by the left and by the frustration and impotence of the comedians, of the politicians, is what we can expect.
[02:46:54.919 --> 02:46:57.081]  But there will be limits, that will be said.
[02:46:57.541 --> 02:47:00.962]  Now, let me go back into why it's important that Flynn left.
[02:47:01.743 --> 02:47:06.404]  Flynn understood that he had a limited time within the National Security Agency.
[02:47:06.825 --> 02:47:08.705]  It had nothing to do with Bannon.
[02:47:08.745 --> 02:47:10.826]  It had nothing to do with Jared Kushner.
[02:47:10.886 --> 02:47:15.388]  It had much more to do with a much more important triumvirate, which has
[02:47:15.968 --> 02:47:33.020]  Legitimacy in this administration, and that triumvirate has to be James Mattis, Secretary of Defense, Pompey, Director of the CIA, and the other generals who are involved in taking care and maintaining our stability.
[02:47:33.280 --> 02:47:34.861]  Now, what am I saying?
[02:47:35.101 --> 02:47:36.682]  This is not a military coup.
[02:47:36.822 --> 02:48:00.938]  What it is, in fact, is a disciplined, highly professional staff who happen to have been military officers, ran major institutions in the thousands and thousands who now are coming into the civilian ranks, running the government as it should be a professional organization, be it a business or a military organization, and they're cleaning out everything that's not
[02:48:01.318 --> 02:48:06.225]  Sure, but the media is using it to then legitimize the whole Russian thing and really create a hysteria.
[02:48:06.305 --> 02:48:07.947]  Just stop right there because I have to ask this question.
[02:48:08.448 --> 02:48:13.936]  As you know, foreign policy is an arm of the Washington Post and the CFR, and it kind of puts out what the establishment is really thinking.
[02:48:14.476 --> 02:48:17.260]  They had come out and said the Kremlin is really starting to worry about Trump.
[02:48:17.981 --> 02:48:38.060]  Then it goes into, okay, we know Trump's really not crazy, he really is a nationalist, has this plan to devolve power, and America's going to be so powerful through the global system now, it's going to take over, and we were actually going to weaken America through globalism, so Putin, you really ought to be against Trump, because he really is meaning what he says he's going to do, and really is a revolutionary, and we're scared of him.
[02:48:38.340 --> 02:48:43.545]  So the establishment communicating with itself in this two-day-old article really tips their hand
[02:48:44.085 --> 02:48:45.387]  And they do this in a lot of other articles.
[02:48:45.447 --> 02:48:49.971]  I mean, they really know that Trump, look, he is trying to get rid of the fines on Obamacare.
[02:48:50.192 --> 02:48:51.453]  He is trying to control the borders.
[02:48:51.713 --> 02:48:54.757]  He is really trying to get loans to Main Street instead of Wall Street.
[02:48:55.057 --> 02:48:56.318]  And look at the economy take off.
[02:48:56.618 --> 02:49:01.263]  Goldman Sachs has already made all this money just off of what Trump did, but they're still working against him.
[02:49:01.604 --> 02:49:03.446]  I just don't get why they don't just back down.
[02:49:04.428 --> 02:49:10.830]  Well, the key here is, listen, first of all, most of Goldman Sachs is in the Trump administration, let's be frank.
[02:49:11.631 --> 02:49:24.015]  Mr. Cohen, who was CEO of Goldman Sachs, is a serious banker, was asked, he did not volunteer, he was asked by Jared Kushner to come in to be head of the Economic Council.
[02:49:24.375 --> 02:49:26.156]  You have Mnuchin, who came in.
[02:49:26.256 --> 02:49:31.278]  No, I know, but he brought, but I'm saying, he's blowing up the whole Goldman Sachs last ten year plan.
[02:49:31.658 --> 02:49:32.639]  Well, that's correct.
[02:49:32.679 --> 02:49:34.700]  But at the same time, let me be frank.
[02:49:34.740 --> 02:49:36.361]  There are two elements that are going on.
[02:49:36.502 --> 02:49:42.426]  First, Trump is cleaning out our government and our institutions as if we were a nation-state.
[02:49:43.146 --> 02:49:45.588]  Obama never treated us as a nation-state.
[02:49:45.908 --> 02:49:46.669]  Bush Jr.
[02:49:46.689 --> 02:49:48.310]  never treated us a nation-state.
[02:49:48.430 --> 02:49:49.331]  And neither did Clinton.
[02:49:49.531 --> 02:49:50.792]  They had no concept
[02:49:51.112 --> 02:49:57.437]  That this country was more than just a group of bureaucrats who ran an organization and made Kumbaya.
[02:49:57.997 --> 02:50:11.307]  Now, we're coming to very definitive points where we have to have trade with bilateral negotiations, not multilateral, where we have to sit down with the Canadian leaders, with the Mexican leaders, with the Japanese leaders.
[02:50:11.467 --> 02:50:14.850]  It's not an accident, Abe, who happens to be extremely bright,
[02:50:15.310 --> 02:50:22.419]  And understand strategic positioning that he came very quickly to the United States to have a relationship with Trump.
[02:50:22.539 --> 02:50:24.341]  So what does the press highlight?
[02:50:24.401 --> 02:50:27.024]  They don't understand the strategic importance of Japan.
[02:50:27.084 --> 02:50:33.552]  What they highlighted was the fact that there was a non-secure discussion in the dining room.
[02:50:33.872 --> 02:50:34.992]  Absolutely absurd.
[02:50:35.493 --> 02:50:47.116]  The most important element of that visit was not the security, was the fact that Trump could take Prime Minister Abe on a golf course and talk to him over hours.
[02:50:47.216 --> 02:50:50.717]  That's exactly what Eisenhower did with all of the foreign leaders.
[02:50:50.757 --> 02:50:54.018]  Sure, he's actually trying to be president, actually trying to make good deals for the U.S.
[02:50:54.038 --> 02:50:56.399]  that are both ways, not one way.
[02:50:56.719 --> 02:51:01.200]  We'll be right back to talk about those specifically, where all these calls for killing Trump are going.
[02:51:01.220 --> 02:51:03.101]  Because that's being green-lighted by some big people.
[02:51:03.641 --> 02:51:05.742]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[02:51:06.182 --> 02:51:18.206]  The missing link of why our ancestors, whether you were in Africa or ancient Albion, which is England today, why our ancestors were so much stronger.
[02:51:18.226 --> 02:51:23.367]  I mean, there are huge archaeological reports, all sorts of anthropology studies.
[02:51:23.387 --> 02:51:24.528]  You can look them up for yourself.
[02:51:25.228 --> 02:51:34.911]  That show that humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[02:51:35.071 --> 02:51:41.213]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[02:51:42.094 --> 02:51:43.954]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[02:51:44.935 --> 02:51:46.175]  People are falling apart.
[02:51:46.215 --> 02:51:47.215]  They're totally depressed.
[02:51:47.235 --> 02:51:47.776]  They're unhappy.
[02:51:48.356 --> 02:51:49.336]  What is going on?
[02:51:50.597 --> 02:51:54.438]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[02:51:55.680 --> 02:51:58.261]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[02:51:58.641 --> 02:52:00.342]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[02:52:00.542 --> 02:52:07.565]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[02:52:07.805 --> 02:52:16.108]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWarsLife products.
[02:52:17.532 --> 02:52:24.035]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[02:52:24.416 --> 02:52:27.817]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[02:52:27.877 --> 02:52:30.999]  You used the skin to cover yourself for shelter.
[02:52:31.599 --> 02:52:36.682]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[02:52:37.202 --> 02:52:40.344]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarsline.com.
[02:52:40.644 --> 02:52:51.089]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric roots, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[02:52:51.189 --> 02:52:52.630]  The bone is so amazing.
[02:52:53.050 --> 02:52:58.653]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[02:52:59.775 --> 02:53:02.717]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[02:53:03.237 --> 02:53:08.680]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[02:53:08.960 --> 02:53:18.424]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[02:53:18.705 --> 02:53:23.267]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[02:53:23.487 --> 02:53:25.288]  This is a absolute win-win.
[02:53:25.348 --> 02:53:28.129]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
[02:53:28.409 --> 02:53:34.512]  You support InfoWars and all we're doing to promote freedom and the restoration of our Republic and promotion of freedom worldwide.
[02:53:35.812 --> 02:53:44.556]  The journey towards better health and giving our bodies these amazing compounds that God created starts at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:53:44.716 --> 02:53:49.098]  Three years in the making, incredible research, and the very best ingredients.
[02:53:49.618 --> 02:53:52.239]  I'm Alex Jones, and I may not be a caveman,
[02:53:52.944 --> 02:53:56.227]  But compared to these trendies out there in the street, I'm as close as it gets.
[02:53:56.628 --> 02:54:00.052]  Join me at InfoWarsLive.com and get your caveman formula today.
[02:54:13.141 --> 02:54:18.366]  Alright, I've just got five more minutes with our guests, and then I'm gonna be coasting part of the next hour with Roger Stone.
[02:54:18.386 --> 02:54:20.028]  He wanted me to come on with him, and he's got some other guests.
[02:54:20.809 --> 02:54:27.836]  Look, I've sat here, and I've probably read, I don't want to exaggerate, a thousand articles since last night.
[02:54:27.876 --> 02:54:28.597]  I've scanned over them.
[02:54:29.718 --> 02:54:30.339]  I mean, I've got
[02:54:31.516 --> 02:54:34.778]  Ten public people saying, kill Trump today.
[02:54:35.498 --> 02:54:37.239]  I've got, we're going to overthrow.
[02:54:37.259 --> 02:54:42.403]  I've got Red Guards running around attacking cat sanctuaries and saying they want to, you know, get me.
[02:54:43.463 --> 02:54:45.905]  I mean, it's just like insane scum running around everywhere.
[02:54:45.925 --> 02:54:50.087]  I'm seeing women being beat up all over the country like they target women.
[02:54:50.127 --> 02:54:51.448]  It's like, what did liberals turn into?
[02:54:51.508 --> 02:54:55.150]  It's like, I'm actually ashamed at some points to live in this country.
[02:54:55.230 --> 02:54:56.031]  I love the country.
[02:54:56.071 --> 02:54:56.711]  It's a paradox.
[02:54:56.971 --> 02:54:58.852]  It has some of the best people and some of the worst.
[02:54:58.993 --> 02:55:00.974]  I am ashamed of just the
[02:55:02.270 --> 02:55:10.214]  All these slugs everywhere that don't want to work and it's almost all like little spoiled rotten white kids running around screaming you're an effing white male and then women in hijabs everywhere.
[02:55:10.554 --> 02:55:11.434]  I see it in Austin.
[02:55:11.474 --> 02:55:12.415]  I saw it in D.C.
[02:55:13.155 --> 02:55:19.418]  Literally like they're Islamifying the women handing out hijabs and Islamic women that call for Sharia law run
[02:55:20.058 --> 02:55:21.159]  The Million Woman March.
[02:55:21.259 --> 02:55:21.820]  I was there.
[02:55:21.840 --> 02:55:24.942]  And then women are chanting Allah Akbar with their breasts hanging out.
[02:55:24.962 --> 02:55:26.183]  It's like total mental illness.
[02:55:26.623 --> 02:55:28.605]  Michael Moore is like running around like a psychopath.
[02:55:28.625 --> 02:55:29.185]  Look at this article.
[02:55:29.626 --> 02:55:32.708]  Meetup.com fueling anti-Trump Soros-funded protest.
[02:55:33.189 --> 02:55:35.330]  Networking site pressures members to protest Trump.
[02:55:35.711 --> 02:55:37.472]  The State Department is ignoring Trump.
[02:55:37.492 --> 02:55:39.634]  We can do five more minutes if we've got time, but Jennings, I need to ask you this question.
[02:55:40.114 --> 02:55:41.855]  They're in rebellion against Rex Tillerson.
[02:55:42.056 --> 02:55:43.937]  They say they're going to try to defeat the Russians in
[02:55:47.060 --> 02:55:49.723]  France, which is, quote, Le Pen's a Russian agent.
[02:55:50.283 --> 02:55:51.645]  This is all pure BS.
[02:55:52.185 --> 02:55:55.489]  We saw the Communist Chinese and the Saudi Arabians involved in the election.
[02:55:56.029 --> 02:56:03.437]  And it's just, I can't, so I know you're wanting to say things are good and Trump's trying to get a lot done with what he said, but I'll be honest, it looks like a civil war in the federal government to me.
[02:56:03.477 --> 02:56:04.458]  Dr. Pucinich, what do you say?
[02:56:06.681 --> 02:56:21.113]  It may be perceived as a civil war, but you don't put a man like Rex Tillerson, who's run a $400 billion corporation all over the world, knows every country in the Middle East and Southeast Asia better than any Foreign Service officer.
[02:56:21.313 --> 02:56:22.894]  No, I know he's great for the job.
[02:56:23.375 --> 02:56:25.556]  He will clean out that State Department.
[02:56:25.797 --> 02:56:29.099]  I have run that State Department and there have been 20,000 people.
[02:56:29.420 --> 02:56:30.941]  You could easily clean out 10,000.
[02:56:31.201 --> 02:56:32.082]  No, I agree.
[02:56:32.142 --> 02:56:34.644]  So, why is this going on right now then?
[02:56:35.004 --> 02:56:36.786]  Because I said they're frustrated.
[02:56:36.846 --> 02:56:39.829]  When you're impotent and frustrated, you go into rage.
[02:56:39.989 --> 02:56:41.470]  Into a childish rage.
[02:56:41.630 --> 02:56:43.232]  And that's what's happening to the left.
[02:56:43.572 --> 02:56:46.134]  Can they affect the changes that we will implement?
[02:56:46.435 --> 02:56:46.615]  No.
[02:56:47.075 --> 02:56:49.718]  I can guarantee you none of the changes will occur.
[02:56:49.758 --> 02:56:51.599]  There will be no impeachment hearings again.
[02:56:51.619 --> 02:56:55.323]  So is that why all the other people I talked to say the intelligence community is almost completely behind Trump?
[02:56:56.212 --> 02:56:56.872]  That's correct.
[02:56:56.932 --> 02:57:05.476]  Those who were involved in putting Trump in are behind him, and that's a major number of people in both the civilian and military intelligence.
[02:57:05.876 --> 02:57:11.179]  Contrary to what you hear from the Brennan and others who have left, and will continue to leave.
[02:57:11.239 --> 02:57:12.299]  What is wrong with Brennan?
[02:57:12.359 --> 02:57:13.320]  What is his problem?
[02:57:13.920 --> 02:57:16.982]  His problem was, I don't want to get into Brennan.
[02:57:17.002 --> 02:57:19.924]  I mean, Brennan was an Irish Catholic who went to Fordham.
[02:57:19.944 --> 02:57:21.165]  He was not very bright.
[02:57:21.205 --> 02:57:23.207]  He went to Saudi Arabia, converted.
[02:57:23.567 --> 02:57:30.152]  And when you don't have very bright people who have never really been trained to be professionals, have never been in combat,
[02:57:30.532 --> 02:57:31.392]  That's what you get.
[02:57:31.552 --> 02:57:34.293]  You get the slugs of the intelligence community.
[02:57:34.633 --> 02:57:38.195]  This new intelligence community is way different than anything else.
[02:57:38.735 --> 02:57:44.517]  The new man that we're getting is a naval commander, Vice Admiral of the Navy Special Forces.
[02:57:44.917 --> 02:57:47.978]  He has far more talent in many ways than Mike Flynn.
[02:57:48.098 --> 02:57:49.598]  He will bring in his own team.
[02:57:49.939 --> 02:57:52.880]  He will then get rid of those who were brought in by Flynn.
[02:57:53.140 --> 02:57:54.280]  That is the nature.
[02:57:54.400 --> 02:57:55.400]  Well sir, I hope you're right.
[02:57:55.500 --> 02:57:56.160]  Stay over with us.
[02:57:56.181 --> 02:57:58.021]  This just broke InfoWars.com.
[02:57:58.581 --> 02:58:02.262]  Merkel Thelen from his sources and Wikileaks, and Wikileaks has also put this out.
[02:58:02.862 --> 02:58:03.863]  He will die in jail.
[02:58:03.983 --> 02:58:06.823]  Ex-NSA analyst says intelligence community going nuclear with Trump.
[02:58:07.244 --> 02:58:08.204]  Now we go nuclear.
[02:58:08.224 --> 02:58:10.604]  War between President Trump and intelligence community intensifies.
[02:58:10.905 --> 02:58:13.285]  Former National Security Agency analyst says U.S.
[02:58:13.305 --> 02:58:15.826]  intelligence community is preparing to go nuclear with President Trump.
[02:58:16.286 --> 02:58:27.630]  John Schindler, who spent nearly a decade in the NSA as an intelligence analyst and counterintelligence officer, stated Wednesday the senior intelligence source said Trump will die in jail following a series of tweets concerning recent leaks.
[02:58:27.650 --> 02:58:28.610]  Now we go nuclear.
[02:58:29.050 --> 02:58:31.051]  I see war going to new levels, Schindler wrote.
[02:58:32.592 --> 02:58:34.894]  Email from senior IC friend, it will begin.
[02:58:35.194 --> 02:58:36.115]  He will die in jail.
[02:58:36.756 --> 02:58:38.698]  That's what I see publicly as an attempted coup.
[02:58:38.998 --> 02:58:41.261]  I'm not saying they have the majority of the people, but they're trying.
[02:58:41.461 --> 02:58:42.642]  We'll be back in 70 seconds.
[02:58:43.243 --> 02:58:43.983]  So we'll be back, Doc.
[02:58:44.023 --> 02:58:45.024]  I'll let you comment on that straight ahead.
[02:58:45.044 --> 02:58:45.685]  Thanks for staying with us.
[02:58:45.945 --> 02:58:47.707]  And then we'll, after that, we've got Stone coming on.
[02:58:48.108 --> 02:58:49.369]  Look, I see major movement.
[02:58:49.449 --> 02:58:50.190]  I'm telling you right now.
[02:58:50.470 --> 02:58:51.091]  Get ready, folks.
[02:58:53.248 --> 02:59:02.257]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:59:02.337 --> 02:59:10.564]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:59:10.745 --> 02:59:15.409]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:59:15.609 --> 02:59:22.332]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:59:22.392 --> 02:59:29.476]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:59:29.576 --> 02:59:31.377]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[02:59:31.477 --> 02:59:36.439]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:59:36.599 --> 02:59:40.941]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:59:41.081 --> 02:59:44.303]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:59:44.463 --> 02:59:50.628]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great-tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:59:50.769 --> 02:59:52.990]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:54.352 --> 03:00:00.277]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:17.268 --> 03:00:22.410]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:22.610 --> 03:00:23.630]  All right, let's be clear.
[03:00:23.770 --> 03:00:24.511]  I'm not an actor.
[03:00:24.531 --> 03:00:27.952]  People ask me all the time, are you for real or is this an act?
[03:00:28.352 --> 03:00:30.353]  It's for real, but I'm letting myself be upset.
[03:00:30.814 --> 03:00:33.515]  It's like, you know, be calm, we're winning, don't worry.
[03:00:34.440 --> 03:00:35.060]  I understand that.
[03:00:35.340 --> 03:00:37.081]  But I don't just want to be confident for its sake.
[03:00:37.241 --> 03:00:37.781]  I agree.
[03:00:38.241 --> 03:00:39.262]  Globalism's in trouble.
[03:00:39.302 --> 03:00:39.822]  It's broken.
[03:00:39.882 --> 03:00:40.542]  It's delusional.
[03:00:40.602 --> 03:00:41.222]  It's insane.
[03:00:41.642 --> 03:00:42.323]  It's in trouble.
[03:00:42.663 --> 03:00:47.164]  Almost everybody I talk to, low-level, high-level military, intelligence agencies, they're all behind Trump.
[03:00:48.785 --> 03:00:51.226]  Higher levels of minorities are for Trump than what the media says.
[03:00:51.506 --> 03:00:52.386]  His polls are up.
[03:00:52.686 --> 03:00:53.606]  Good things are happening.
[03:00:53.706 --> 03:00:54.847]  I get we're in a good position.
[03:00:55.207 --> 03:00:58.308]  But they're trying to just push, hey, kill Trump, so crazies try it.
[03:00:59.088 --> 03:01:02.669]  They're openly acting very confident, so I just don't want to be too overconfident here.
[03:01:02.969 --> 03:01:09.731]  So when I get a little hysterical, it's to get America to wake up and understand we won a major battle, but not the war yet.
[03:01:09.811 --> 03:01:21.075]  Dr. Steve Pucinich himself has been involved in regime change around the world and here in the United States, and we're clearly witnessing them say, the Democrats are saying, we're going to overthrow Trump.
[03:01:21.795 --> 03:01:22.655]  We're going to remove him.
[03:01:22.955 --> 03:01:27.096]  Their main mouthpieces are saying that now, with him less than a month in.
[03:01:27.116 --> 03:01:32.317]  So, Dr. Pucinich, again, you're saying, you know, basically everything's okay?
[03:01:32.877 --> 03:01:51.381]  Well, what I'm saying is, I and others who've been involved in regime change, including this regime change, can assure you that what you're seeing now is consequences of having a very rapid knife cut right through the heart of the Democratic
[03:01:51.901 --> 03:01:55.543]  Our people are in, so good luck to the coup people.
[03:01:55.563 --> 03:01:57.204]  Our people are in, so good luck.
[03:02:19.059 --> 03:02:21.900]  The point is we created the counter coup.
[03:02:22.040 --> 03:02:23.521]  We're now in control.
[03:02:23.781 --> 03:02:25.682]  We're not amateurs at this.
[03:02:26.102 --> 03:02:28.583]  We have done this for 30 to 40 years.
[03:02:28.763 --> 03:02:30.724]  The Soviet Union is not our enemy.
[03:02:31.024 --> 03:02:32.005]  Neither is Russia.
[03:02:32.525 --> 03:02:36.387]  Even when I took it down, I said Russia will always remain our ally.
[03:02:36.767 --> 03:02:41.369]  Our ally will be now Saudi Arabia, Israel, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
[03:02:41.389 --> 03:02:43.210]  So who are the new allies in the new system?
[03:02:43.590 --> 03:02:58.075]  The new system allies, and I gotta give credit to Bibi, he brought together Saudi Arabia, UAE, Dubai, all sharing intelligence, and they all want to work with Jared Kushner to bring a solution to the Palestinians and Israelis.
[03:02:58.395 --> 03:03:01.056]  The Israelis understand... So they're finally starting to roll over?
[03:03:02.376 --> 03:03:03.517]  Well, I don't want to call it that.
[03:03:03.577 --> 03:03:05.077]  I want to say it's a new approach.
[03:03:05.157 --> 03:03:09.739]  They understand that for now, the realignment in the Middle East is legitimate.
[03:03:09.759 --> 03:03:12.740]  And that's why Trump said today, we'll soon be announcing some big things.
[03:03:14.039 --> 03:03:16.180]  Well, because Sirius wants peace.
[03:03:16.261 --> 03:03:18.302]  Bashar Assad has had enough war.
[03:03:18.622 --> 03:03:20.103]  He doesn't want any more war.
[03:03:20.303 --> 03:03:24.906]  Iran needs to reconstitute its government, contrary to what other people said.
[03:03:25.227 --> 03:03:29.009]  Secretary of Defense is leery of Iran, which is correct.
[03:03:29.109 --> 03:03:36.074]  Tillerson understands Iran, understands the Middle East better than any other Secretary of State I've ever seen or met before.
[03:03:36.134 --> 03:03:37.355]  I haven't met the gentleman yet.
[03:03:38.155 --> 03:03:41.097]  And the Secretary of Defense is in great control.
[03:03:41.117 --> 03:03:42.117]  He's all his allies.
[03:03:42.137 --> 03:03:47.880]  So we're seeing a temper tantrum by just the dregs that are trying to act tough and act big.
[03:03:47.920 --> 03:03:48.140]  Right.
[03:03:48.220 --> 03:03:49.961]  You're in the baby clinic now.
[03:03:49.981 --> 03:03:57.964]  You're in the Montessori school of Democrats where they're crying and yelling, pooping in their diapers, and basically can't do anything.
[03:03:58.045 --> 03:03:59.685]  They're just screaming and pooping.
[03:03:59.985 --> 03:04:00.826]  That's all it is.
[03:04:01.286 --> 03:04:07.733]  For the most part, we control the house, we control the personnel, we control the cash flows, we control everything.
[03:04:07.853 --> 03:04:09.114]  I'm not being complacent.
[03:04:09.394 --> 03:04:16.682]  I'm just saying to the people who have watched your show, who have been part of the revolution, the revolution hasn't just stopped, it continues.
[03:04:16.762 --> 03:04:20.306]  Because part of that revolution is we clean out our own people.
[03:04:20.666 --> 03:04:25.987]  We then clean out those who are in our way, and then we continue to increase the growth.
[03:04:26.107 --> 03:04:32.029]  We continue to make sure that America does attain ascendancy into being number one.
[03:04:32.049 --> 03:04:33.229]  Thank you so much for the time.
[03:04:33.369 --> 03:04:36.090]  All I know is they start blowing stuff up and rioting.
[03:04:36.190 --> 03:04:40.451]  I don't want to see too strong a response by Trump, but he has to respond to people trying to overthrow the government.
[03:04:41.665 --> 03:04:46.129]  There's no question about it, but their attempt to overthrow won't even get to page one.
[03:04:46.290 --> 03:04:46.770]  Trust me.
[03:04:46.910 --> 03:04:48.652]  I've been in regime change for too long.
[03:04:49.133 --> 03:04:50.474]  We anticipated this.
[03:04:50.534 --> 03:04:52.096]  We understood it from day one.
[03:04:52.416 --> 03:04:57.782]  As I said to you very early on, years ago, we're going to have a major change.
[03:04:57.802 --> 03:04:59.104]  We're going to have a counter coup.
[03:04:59.464 --> 03:05:01.006]  That coup will be effective.
[03:05:01.086 --> 03:05:01.586]  And it's happened.
[03:05:01.606 --> 03:05:02.427]  Thank you, Dr. Pucinich.
[03:05:02.467 --> 03:05:02.808]  Amazing.
[03:05:03.872 --> 03:05:08.976]  The military industrial complex is trying to sabotage Donald Trump.
[03:05:09.156 --> 03:05:13.258]  Last night, National Security Advisor Michael Flynn officially resigned.
[03:05:13.298 --> 03:05:18.462]  This following reports that he had misled officials about his contacts with Russia.
[03:05:18.522 --> 03:05:25.627]  Meanwhile, the establishment media says this validates their conspiracy theory that Russia hacked the U.S.
[03:05:25.707 --> 03:05:26.167]  elections.
[03:05:26.307 --> 03:05:32.611]  They are also claiming that General Flynn's conversation with the Russian ambassador is a violation of the Logan Act.
[03:05:32.831 --> 03:05:33.492]  But wait a minute.
[03:05:33.812 --> 03:05:37.253]  Where was the mainstream media during the Bilderberg conferences?
[03:05:37.473 --> 03:05:47.097]  You know, the secret group of global elitists ignored by the mainstream media as they privately meet each year to plan and coordinate global policy.
[03:05:47.397 --> 03:05:56.320]  Look, the establishment wants to purge the Trump administration and replace them with compromised Washington insiders and globalists.
[03:05:56.460 --> 03:05:59.621]  In other words, they are trying to refill the swamp.
[03:05:59.921 --> 03:06:02.342]  You can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.

[03:06:58.404 --> 03:07:00.988]  That's Infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[03:07:07.799 --> 03:07:09.319]  There is a crisis in America today.
[03:07:09.780 --> 03:07:12.160]  Tens of millions of us are addicted to cell phones.
[03:07:12.480 --> 03:07:19.883]  These little devices, according to many university studies and more, cause health risks such as depression, cancer, and social anxiety.
[03:07:20.283 --> 03:07:23.884]  How can we prevent these harmful devices from harming us and our families?
[03:07:23.904 --> 03:07:25.384]  I have the answer for you today.
[03:07:25.785 --> 03:07:26.945]  It's called the Blocky Pocket.
[03:07:27.691 --> 03:07:33.015]  The Block-It Pocket works by securing your phone in a safe, no-radiation compartment.
[03:07:33.436 --> 03:07:39.200]  I use the Block-It Pocket every day to protect me from harmful radiation and prevent others from stealing my stuff.
[03:07:40.041 --> 03:07:42.483]  Online, your entire persona is visible.
[03:07:42.703 --> 03:07:48.647]  Your credit card numbers, your email, everything about you that a criminal can use to hack and buy things under your name.
[03:07:49.428 --> 03:07:51.492]  With a blocking pocket, this is impossible.
[03:07:51.573 --> 03:07:54.238]  It blocks those harmful signals so that you can be safe.
[03:07:54.579 --> 03:07:59.129]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com today and make sure to secure your very own blocking pocket.
[03:08:14.620 --> 03:08:19.704]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:08:20.285 --> 03:08:22.587]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:08:28.749 --> 03:08:36.915]  You know, I've got to get around our liner guy and send him a bunch of new liners and say, now hosting the Info War is Roger Stone, or now hosting the Info War.
[03:08:37.195 --> 03:08:38.956]  From London is Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:08:39.697 --> 03:08:43.479]  Perhaps I should just cut him myself, because I guess I could do him as good as our guy.
[03:08:43.559 --> 03:08:46.141]  Peter Reef's great, but he's one of the best voices out there.
[03:08:46.161 --> 03:08:48.043]  He does it for Fox News and a bunch of other channels.
[03:08:48.063 --> 03:08:51.505]  But the problem is, is he does it too happy for those channels.
[03:08:51.545 --> 03:08:54.067]  Like, oh, it's Alex Jones, the wondrous.
[03:08:54.087 --> 03:08:57.950]  No, he's just like, it's Alex Jones and the fight for the Republic worldwide.
[03:08:58.908 --> 03:09:00.549]  Because it really is that epic battle.
[03:09:00.569 --> 03:09:01.790]  Look, we've got our president in.
[03:09:01.830 --> 03:09:03.051]  He's doing everything he said he'd do.
[03:09:03.811 --> 03:09:07.453]  And I just talked to Steve Pchenik, who is hooked into the highest levels of the CIA.
[03:09:07.794 --> 03:09:09.795]  He used to run their psychological warfare operations.
[03:09:10.275 --> 03:09:13.557]  I'm hooked into very high-level CIA myself.
[03:09:14.018 --> 03:09:16.419]  And all these years, people said, you're CIA, you're with the CIA.
[03:09:16.479 --> 03:09:17.280]  And I said, no, I'm not.
[03:09:18.621 --> 03:09:23.243]  And there's a bunch of articles saying, what is Jones going to do now that the power structure is
[03:09:26.414 --> 03:09:29.635]  You know, his people, where's his conspiracies gonna go?
[03:09:29.655 --> 03:09:32.816]  It's a total war to keep Trump from fixing things.
[03:09:33.076 --> 03:09:37.298]  And then if Trump ever actually got a bunch of his stuff completed, then I'd be a watchdog.
[03:09:38.378 --> 03:09:41.279]  I'm not, you know, just loyal to Trump because he's Trump.
[03:09:41.799 --> 03:09:45.040]  I'm loyal because he wants to restore the republic and so my kids have a future.
[03:09:45.921 --> 03:09:48.482]  I'm totally committed, but they think the listeners are dumb.
[03:09:49.002 --> 03:09:52.343]  Oh, now that Trump's in, does Alex not believe in the same conspiracy theories?
[03:09:52.763 --> 03:09:54.724]  What, like that the polls were fake and Trump was gonna win?
[03:09:55.584 --> 03:10:04.826]  Or, it's been now released this week, it's in the Intercept and other news, that the Pentagon under Obama was preparing for a total takeover during a collapse.
[03:10:04.966 --> 03:10:06.147]  I'm totally proven right again.
[03:10:06.467 --> 03:10:09.067]  I was told that by people high level in Special Forces!
[03:10:09.087 --> 03:10:12.068]  I mean, we don't make stuff up around here.
[03:10:12.108 --> 03:10:15.449]  We told you a month before, Mitt Romney would never be Secretary of State.
[03:10:16.465 --> 03:10:18.346]  Because a certain person was the source on that.
[03:10:18.366 --> 03:10:21.087]  I don't like to brag, but he just, I guess, had read the tea leaves.
[03:10:21.747 --> 03:10:24.888]  But the point is, we don't shovel BS here.
[03:10:25.388 --> 03:10:28.389]  And Roger Stone normally hosts every Wednesday in the fourth hour.
[03:10:28.429 --> 03:10:30.870]  He invited me to pop on with him some today.
[03:10:30.890 --> 03:10:35.892]  So I'm here to the bottom of the hour, here to 20 after, and I'm going to get in there for the nightly news and a bunch of big announcements.
[03:10:35.912 --> 03:10:38.072]  But obviously, Michael Moore's announced it.
[03:10:38.092 --> 03:10:38.993]  It's all over the news.
[03:10:39.033 --> 03:10:40.173]  The Democrats are in press conferences.
[03:10:40.473 --> 03:10:41.734]  We want to arrest Trump.
[03:10:42.154 --> 03:10:43.254]  We want to overthrow him.
[03:10:43.274 --> 03:10:44.675]  We want to install Hillary.
[03:10:45.535 --> 03:10:46.956]  This is almost even better.
[03:10:47.477 --> 03:10:50.099]  I mean, the new old order really is going to go down if they try this.
[03:10:50.219 --> 03:10:51.000]  Nationalism.
[03:10:51.800 --> 03:10:54.162]  The nationalist is in the lead in the presidential race in the Netherlands.
[03:10:54.182 --> 03:10:56.524]  The nationalist is in the lead in France, Le Pen.
[03:10:57.065 --> 03:10:57.585]  And guess what?
[03:10:57.765 --> 03:10:58.266]  Same thing.
[03:10:58.606 --> 03:10:59.006]  Merkel.
[03:10:59.687 --> 03:11:02.349]  Two-thirds of Germans in major polls say they hate her.
[03:11:02.810 --> 03:11:04.231]  Oh, they're all Russian spies.
[03:11:04.911 --> 03:11:05.292]  That's right.
[03:11:05.392 --> 03:11:08.815]  I was against Obamacare and gun control because Putin did so.
[03:11:09.455 --> 03:11:12.257]  This is asinine, but he's in the New York Times today.
[03:11:13.078 --> 03:11:25.194]  Him and Manafort, why the Brennan, the converted Wahhabist, he says they're Russian spies or they talk to the Russians and then...
[03:11:26.172 --> 03:11:28.973]  Manafort says he's boggled because he never did.
[03:11:29.013 --> 03:11:31.374]  It's the same recycled story three times.
[03:11:31.414 --> 03:11:32.735]  The last time was January 20th.
[03:11:33.255 --> 03:11:34.536]  This is crazy, folks.
[03:11:34.556 --> 03:11:35.376]  This is insane.
[03:11:35.776 --> 03:11:39.618]  Meanwhile, the communist Chinese, all of them, are in the news saying, take Trump out.
[03:11:40.058 --> 03:11:43.299]  And Silicon Valley says, China, help us stop Trump.
[03:11:43.840 --> 03:11:44.860]  We'll help, don't worry.
[03:11:45.240 --> 03:11:49.122]  Foreign powers openly involved, communist country.
[03:11:51.052 --> 03:11:52.733]  Yeah, that's a nice tie, Roger Stone.
[03:11:53.314 --> 03:11:53.874]  Nice suit.
[03:11:54.194 --> 03:11:54.514]  I bet.
[03:11:54.795 --> 03:11:56.195]  Did Putin help you put that on?
[03:11:56.215 --> 03:11:58.517]  Because everybody knows he helps us shave in the morning.
[03:11:58.777 --> 03:12:00.278]  America couldn't vote and get Trump.
[03:12:00.498 --> 03:12:01.439]  We couldn't do anything.
[03:12:01.479 --> 03:12:05.141]  We couldn't, you know, go expose his illegitimate black son and get the black vote.
[03:12:05.362 --> 03:12:06.202]  We didn't have any effect.
[03:12:06.222 --> 03:12:06.983]  You didn't have any effect.
[03:12:07.183 --> 03:12:09.304]  You don't have a best-selling book, The Making of a President.
[03:12:09.504 --> 03:12:10.865]  America's never succeeded before.
[03:12:11.185 --> 03:12:11.326]  Why?
[03:12:11.386 --> 03:12:13.087]  I mean, you've heard Maxine Waters.
[03:12:13.387 --> 03:12:17.590]  Trump had to be given the term, uh, crooked Hillary from Putin.
[03:12:17.610 --> 03:12:20.872]  Because Trump couldn't think of her being crooked himself, could he?
[03:12:22.113 --> 03:12:30.679]  Yeah, Alex, you were exactly right on election night when you said to me, this isn't the end, this is just the beginning.
[03:12:31.179 --> 03:12:33.360]  In fact, the biggest fight is ahead of us.
[03:12:33.741 --> 03:12:34.921]  You were absolutely right.
[03:12:35.462 --> 03:12:48.311]  The two-party duopoly and the establishment simply will not accede to the democratic election of Donald Trump and let him exercise his constitutional authority to reform our government
[03:12:49.219 --> 03:12:51.922]  And to make America great again.
[03:12:52.443 --> 03:13:01.613]  They are going to resist this at every level, including breaking the law if it's necessary, including the illegal monitoring of U.S.
[03:13:01.633 --> 03:13:07.018]  government officials, and the leaking of that information, which is, of course, a felony.
[03:13:07.499 --> 03:13:10.963]  Precisely what's happened here in the case of General Flynn.
[03:13:12.150 --> 03:13:21.880]  And just to be clear, I've been covering politics 20 years, but I grew up getting mother's milk during the, when you were there in the Nixon administration, watching the whole hearings in Congress.
[03:13:22.220 --> 03:13:33.992]  Everybody knows that an incoming group talks to all the diplomats and back and forth, and that it's a president's sovereign purview as a separate branch of government to go sign treaties with the Russians if he wants, then Congress has to ratify.
[03:13:34.292 --> 03:13:39.374]  I mean, the president can do whatever he wants with the Russians, then it gets judged by us, the voters.
[03:13:39.754 --> 03:13:51.758]  This idea that it violates the Logan Act, the TPP with Hillary and Obama, secretly negotiating with private corporations the deal without Congress and not letting them have a copy, that's treason!
[03:13:52.138 --> 03:13:59.120]  The head of state, with his designates, communicating with other heads of state, is the exact purview of the chief executive!
[03:14:00.560 --> 03:14:01.985]  No, this is extraordinary.
[03:14:02.688 --> 03:14:04.273]  It is entirely appropriate.
[03:14:04.969 --> 03:14:18.438]  For General Flynn to make contact with the Russians to set up, you know, an initial congratulatory call between the new president and the head of the Russian state.
[03:14:18.839 --> 03:14:24.082]  We know from the transcripts that there was no substantive discussion of sanctions.
[03:14:25.103 --> 03:14:31.488]  And we know from a review by the White House Counsel's Office that General Flynn violated no laws.
[03:14:32.188 --> 03:14:36.452]  This was typical inside-the-beltway lynching.
[03:14:36.752 --> 03:14:40.675]  This is Priebus, and let's just say it, and I like him, it's the vice president.
[03:14:40.735 --> 03:14:43.938]  It's the big Republican establishment swinging their wee-wees around.
[03:14:45.233 --> 03:14:46.554]  Yeah, there's no question about it.
[03:14:46.914 --> 03:14:50.798]  And as Dr. Horsey wrote today at InfoWars, he's exactly right.
[03:14:51.358 --> 03:14:53.060]  The game plan here is very simple.
[03:14:53.560 --> 03:14:55.362]  Purge the Trump loyalists.
[03:14:55.822 --> 03:15:04.749]  First General Flynn, then the very capable Stephen Miller, and then finally the President's Chief Issues Man, Steve Bannon.
[03:15:05.230 --> 03:15:08.353]  The problem here for them, for the Republican establishment, is
[03:15:08.973 --> 03:15:12.638]  That we Trump loyalists are not going to stand for it.
[03:15:12.978 --> 03:15:16.483]  There is zero chance we will let this happen.
[03:15:16.803 --> 03:15:25.735]  And if we have to mobilize the grassroots to make sure the president knows we have his back, I'm prepared to do so and I know you are as well.
[03:15:26.727 --> 03:15:29.789]  I get why he had to bring Priebus and them in, because that's a big system to run.
[03:15:29.829 --> 03:15:30.729]  He wanted to work with them.
[03:15:30.749 --> 03:15:33.751]  But there's such... And then Ryan gets on TV and says, I'm going to work with him.
[03:15:33.771 --> 03:15:36.533]  He looked like a weasel, like Eddie Haskell when he said it.
[03:15:37.433 --> 03:15:40.955]  And now we know Priebus is the leaker on a lot of this stuff.
[03:15:41.015 --> 03:15:44.798]  It's come... Even mainstream media, and I know we have sources, who've talked to the little guy.
[03:15:45.198 --> 03:15:46.979]  So he better... I mean, you know, here's the deal.
[03:15:47.639 --> 03:15:51.061]  We're just going to get a data package together, obviously, everybody, but do it through Twitter, you name it.
[03:15:51.381 --> 03:15:53.903]  The public... It's not just Roger and I. He hears the public.
[03:15:54.323 --> 03:15:55.464]  And I'm doing a big story on this tonight.
[03:15:56.437 --> 03:16:01.924]  It's confirmed for two weeks, no one's allowed to get in the Twitter feed where he can read it, but hundreds down.
[03:16:01.964 --> 03:16:06.611]  They block it, so he doesn't see your link, doesn't read your article, doesn't retweet you, okay?
[03:16:06.671 --> 03:16:08.533]  They're trying to cut him off, okay?
[03:16:08.914 --> 03:16:10.536]  And so, they don't even let you...
[03:16:11.717 --> 03:16:14.218]  Get to the president now, and they only put haters up at the top.
[03:16:14.798 --> 03:16:16.298]  And Priebus has been meeting with Twitter.
[03:16:16.558 --> 03:16:18.718]  This is all a disgusting little action.
[03:16:19.158 --> 03:16:20.339]  So this is incredible.
[03:16:20.379 --> 03:16:27.500]  They're trying to cut Trump off from the American people, and it's disgusting, and it's an example of how controlled this is.
[03:16:27.600 --> 03:16:35.581]  If they can censor and hijack the president's feed, and it's not even in the news, then folks, imagine what else is going on.
[03:16:35.601 --> 03:16:38.162]  I remember a month ago, they said let's ban the president off Twitter.
[03:16:40.421 --> 03:16:41.322]  Roger, where does this go?
[03:16:41.982 --> 03:16:43.144]  No, it's really extraordinary.
[03:16:43.304 --> 03:16:54.854]  Alex, you know, I pick up the paper and I read that the President's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who I have a very high regard for, is meeting with the captains of Silicon Valley as if they are our friends.
[03:16:54.915 --> 03:16:55.875]  Let's be very clear.
[03:16:56.596 --> 03:17:11.869]  Google particularly, Facebook, sought to undermine Donald Trump in this campaign, fiddled with their SEO to try to bury bad news about Hillary Clinton, elevate any criticism of Donald Trump.
[03:17:12.369 --> 03:17:14.891]  These folks are not our friends.
[03:17:15.392 --> 03:17:33.129]  Again, Dr. Jerry Corsi has done extraordinary research into Google's efforts to infiltrate this administration so they can have the kind of advantages and the kind of inside fix on the issues they care about that they enjoyed under eight years of Barack Obama.
[03:17:33.649 --> 03:17:46.236]  The Silicon Valley crowd, the Wall Street crowd, the inside the Beltway lobbyist culture, and the establishment Republican Party are not our friends.
[03:17:46.677 --> 03:17:51.179]  They are not part of the Trump revolution.
[03:17:51.299 --> 03:17:54.201]  Little Freudian slip there.
[03:17:54.441 --> 03:17:58.364]  They are doing everything possible they can to foot drag.
[03:17:59.264 --> 03:18:11.008]  And now I'm increasingly concerned that Reince Priebus' inserting himself into the selection of ambassadors is going to give us people who are unqualified.
[03:18:11.728 --> 03:18:21.051]  As Dr. Corsi broke the news today, Priebus circumvented the State Department, violated a commitment that was given to the Secretary of State,
[03:18:22.116 --> 03:18:33.981]  Rex Tillerson, that he would have the ability to interview the candidates for the absolutely strategically key embassies, and instead now those jobs are going to RNC.
[03:18:34.242 --> 03:18:35.742]  He should be fired right there!
[03:18:35.802 --> 03:18:40.384]  He's off the Republican Party donors that Trump got none of the money from.
[03:18:40.564 --> 03:18:41.525]  He doesn't want their money.
[03:18:41.565 --> 03:18:42.886]  He's kicking them out of politics.
[03:18:43.186 --> 03:18:45.887]  Why the hell are all these talk...
[03:18:46.207 --> 03:18:54.293]  All these peacocks, all these narcissists that want to go stand around at embassies and act like they're fancies pants and have these stupid parties.
[03:18:54.734 --> 03:18:57.876]  Why are all these wannabe thirds and how the thirds even being allowed in?
[03:18:59.097 --> 03:19:07.344]  Well, only minutes ago we got word that the nominee for Secretary of Labor, Andy Puzder, is withdrawing his name.
[03:19:08.035 --> 03:19:10.496]  Where did his name come from to begin with?
[03:19:11.016 --> 03:19:12.416]  I can answer that in two words.
[03:19:12.956 --> 03:19:14.216]  Reince Priebus.
[03:19:14.297 --> 03:19:16.137]  And by the way, see how we're on target.
[03:19:16.177 --> 03:19:18.538]  See how that's in Corsi's headline.
[03:19:18.578 --> 03:19:19.498]  I just trust Corsi.
[03:19:19.538 --> 03:19:21.038]  Three number one New York Times bestsellers.
[03:19:21.458 --> 03:19:22.358]  All of his key deals.
[03:19:22.538 --> 03:19:24.039]  Absolutely upsetting two elections.
[03:19:24.419 --> 03:19:26.139]  I don't know his sources, but he's been in D.C.
[03:19:26.159 --> 03:19:27.240]  He's moved there, back there.
[03:19:27.580 --> 03:19:32.681]  He's at these meetings and he said that it is incredible what's going on with Priebus and there is no doubt.
[03:19:33.661 --> 03:19:34.721]  We'll put his article on screen.
[03:19:34.961 --> 03:19:36.922]  There is no doubt that Priebus is one of the prime leakers.
[03:19:37.242 --> 03:19:40.244]  Here it is, Priebus next to go as Trump strikes back over Flynn.
[03:19:40.304 --> 03:19:44.566]  I talked to some of my folks that are connected in to the intelligence agencies.
[03:19:44.926 --> 03:19:47.127]  And again, I'm not with an intelligence agency.
[03:19:47.147 --> 03:19:48.608]  I'm an independent American citizen.
[03:19:48.888 --> 03:19:52.530]  Most of the intelligence agencies are totally against the globalists because they're sick of it.
[03:19:52.770 --> 03:19:53.770]  They want America back.
[03:19:53.810 --> 03:19:57.352]  So all they're doing is confirming or denying info for me so I know.
[03:19:57.672 --> 03:20:01.494]  But they say that it looks like the fate of Priebus is still not known.
[03:20:01.514 --> 03:20:02.615]  I guess that's in Trump's brain?
[03:20:04.005 --> 03:20:29.372]  Well, in an odd sense, while the Flynn ouster may be a catalyst, it may be the beginning of the dominoes that end with the fall of Mr. Priebus, they have also run interference because this is a much bigger story than the mismanagement of the White House and the leaking of information from White House staffers that make the President look foolish.
[03:20:29.392 --> 03:20:29.952]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[03:20:30.672 --> 03:20:36.279]  Chris Ruddy got called up by high-level players, as high as they go except the president, and told, please backtrack on this.
[03:20:36.860 --> 03:20:40.625]  And I'm not going to get into the rest of it, but I mean, that went on.
[03:20:40.665 --> 03:20:41.486]  He admitted that happened.
[03:20:42.483 --> 03:20:45.245]  Yeah, on the other hand, I still don't think this will stand.
[03:20:45.265 --> 03:21:01.594]  It is my understanding that Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon, who I have a very high regard for and have defended in a dozen forums from the outrageous attacks on him, that he is an anti-Semite or a bigot or a nativist, all those things are false.
[03:21:02.654 --> 03:21:10.819]  They're doing these joint telephone calls with reporters, telling them how much they love each other and how they work so closely together.
[03:21:11.559 --> 03:21:13.981]  These are like hostage videos, Alex.
[03:21:14.661 --> 03:21:16.382]  They're being forced to say those things.
[03:21:16.822 --> 03:21:18.864]  At least in this case, I think Bannon is.
[03:21:19.364 --> 03:21:28.410]  He's a good man, but he ought to be aware that he is on Priebus' target list next, right after the very capable Stephen Miller.
[03:21:28.550 --> 03:21:32.732]  Well, it's funny, you know, they have the public policy kind of foreign affairs branch.
[03:21:32.752 --> 03:21:36.135]  The Washington Post came out and admitted, an article we covered a lot the last few days, that
[03:21:36.855 --> 03:21:37.755]  Okay, Trump's really for real.
[03:21:37.775 --> 03:21:38.435]  He's a nationalist.
[03:21:38.455 --> 03:21:39.275]  He wants prosperity.
[03:21:39.616 --> 03:21:42.216]  America's going to take over the whole globalist system, basically.
[03:21:42.576 --> 03:21:45.076]  And Russia better watch out, because globalists were going to work with Russia.
[03:21:45.356 --> 03:21:47.277]  But Trump's actually just going to be totally dominant.
[03:21:47.637 --> 03:21:49.217]  So we hope the Russians understand that.
[03:21:49.517 --> 03:21:53.658]  And they admit that Bannon and Trump and everybody just want Americana and good deals for us.
[03:21:53.978 --> 03:21:57.779]  And the truth is, if we just get these deals before they can plunge the economy, it's game over.
[03:21:57.999 --> 03:21:59.459]  We're going to dominate everybody.
[03:21:59.899 --> 03:22:00.739]  I mean, give me a break.
[03:22:00.799 --> 03:22:02.419]  China's tottering on the edge of collapse.
[03:22:02.840 --> 03:22:04.980]  So why doesn't the globalists just get out of the way?
[03:22:05.620 --> 03:22:07.764]  And let the United States of America dominate.
[03:22:08.805 --> 03:22:10.628]  Here's what really bothers them, Alex.
[03:22:10.688 --> 03:22:13.813]  They realize that we could be on the verge of peace.
[03:22:15.263 --> 03:22:20.925]  In Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, you have two very, very tough guys.
[03:22:21.585 --> 03:22:23.765]  Two very stubborn guys.
[03:22:24.225 --> 03:22:28.626]  Two guys who have the best interests of their respective countries at heart.
[03:22:29.267 --> 03:22:37.989]  I am convinced that if Brezhnev and Nixon can hammer out an agreement on the strategic arms limitations, then Trump
[03:22:39.029 --> 03:22:42.152]  And Putin can make a deal for peace.
[03:22:42.212 --> 03:22:44.373]  And the bureaucracy admits they don't want that.
[03:22:44.534 --> 03:22:49.237]  And they admit that Russia wants to do deals and not get bankrupted by a new Cold War.
[03:22:49.558 --> 03:22:50.779]  We don't want to be bankrupted by one.
[03:22:50.799 --> 03:22:53.260]  There'll be plenty of defense spending, plenty of issues.
[03:22:53.521 --> 03:22:54.301]  It's ridiculous.
[03:22:54.521 --> 03:23:03.609]  We shouldn't sit here because the neocons want to reconquer Russia because Trotsky got kicked out and they've still got a hard-on for the Russians because they got to kill so many of them.
[03:23:03.849 --> 03:23:04.990]  They're bloodthirsty for them.
[03:23:06.051 --> 03:23:08.492]  I think we all know what this is really about.
[03:23:08.953 --> 03:23:17.617]  Hillary Clinton had promised the boys at Langley and the folks at the Pentagon that they would have a wider proxy war in Syria.
[03:23:18.197 --> 03:23:20.739]  They were licking their chops over a no-fly zone.
[03:23:21.239 --> 03:23:23.940]  God, we could get World War III, wouldn't that be great?
[03:23:24.400 --> 03:23:26.061]  This is how the neocons think.
[03:23:26.682 --> 03:23:30.904]  Donald Trump has no intention of going out and provoking an unnecessary war.
[03:23:30.924 --> 03:23:32.925]  And by the way, the Pentagon, the Pentagon,
[03:23:33.769 --> 03:23:36.771]  It was one that helped block the neocons on this, and let's take Netanyahu.
[03:23:37.051 --> 03:23:38.312]  They claim to ally with the neocons.
[03:23:38.752 --> 03:23:41.974]  Netanyahu's even signaling he doesn't want big wars and wants to stop this.
[03:23:41.994 --> 03:23:42.535]  What does that mean?
[03:23:43.655 --> 03:23:49.379]  Well, because, look, he is another leader who has the best interests of his country at heart.
[03:23:49.839 --> 03:23:58.505]  War is good for no one other than the defense contractors and many of Hillary Clinton's biggest donors to the Clinton Foundation.
[03:23:58.685 --> 03:24:01.027]  Steve Pucinich with his sources, and again, I have mine as well.
[03:24:02.548 --> 03:24:04.769]  They say, look, this is like babies throwing fits.
[03:24:05.950 --> 03:24:08.532]  You know, everybody's saying, kill Trump, overthrow him.
[03:24:09.133 --> 03:24:11.635]  He's, you know, the press conference is saying he's a Russian agent.
[03:24:11.875 --> 03:24:12.615]  It's going nowhere.
[03:24:12.856 --> 03:24:18.380]  Well, then why get rid of Flynn when Trump, even today, when Netanyahu said, I like him, you know, Flynn's a great guy.
[03:24:18.740 --> 03:24:22.803]  Why have, you know, the press secretary say, well, it was a trust issue and he just didn't tell them the truth.
[03:24:23.123 --> 03:24:29.128]  When he said, no, we didn't substantively discuss sanctions, the Russians just said they wanted to talk about sanctions with the president.
[03:24:29.148 --> 03:24:29.588]  That's what you do.
[03:24:30.649 --> 03:24:34.093]  Yeah, it's agenda setting.
[03:24:34.133 --> 03:24:39.078]  This was very sadly a typical inside the beltway lynching.
[03:24:39.598 --> 03:24:46.865]  General Flynn, who is I think a great man and a great patriot, and a man who understands the dangers of Islamic
[03:24:48.607 --> 03:24:48.647]  Uh,
[03:25:03.926 --> 03:25:06.729]  Protocol breach, and we could have moved on.
[03:25:06.749 --> 03:25:07.930]  You told me that yesterday.
[03:25:08.010 --> 03:25:25.425]  It looked like Trump got stampeded like Priebus does, where he calls people in, says they're fired, the person gets depressed, goes in and resigns, and it kind of says like he was told, so he resigned and went and apologized, and Trump looked like today he got, he wasn't playing good cop, because I know from people that have said, he doesn't play good cop, bad cop, he'll fire you if you're really firing you.
[03:25:25.705 --> 03:25:28.247]  He's like, well Flynn's a really great guy, too bad this happened.
[03:25:28.587 --> 03:25:30.149]  Almost like he wasn't behind that.
[03:25:31.513 --> 03:25:39.839]  Yeah, perhaps the President is looking at all the facts in the whirlwind of the last 48 hours and he's come to that conclusion.
[03:25:40.320 --> 03:25:44.783]  Look, I also don't think Sean Spicer is doing the President any good.
[03:25:44.803 --> 03:25:47.225]  By the way, Trump called it a criminal attack on a wonderful man.
[03:25:47.585 --> 03:25:50.687]  Trump ramps up war on his own spies as he rages against Democrats.
[03:25:51.028 --> 03:25:52.289]  Leakers who he legally brought down.
[03:25:52.329 --> 03:25:53.149]  Disgrace Mike Flynn.
[03:25:53.430 --> 03:25:53.630]  Yeah!
[03:25:54.230 --> 03:25:57.394]  In fact, I was heard this from Little Birds, and now it's pretty much confirmed by this.
[03:25:57.834 --> 03:26:01.438]  They stampeded him just like they tried with, can I say the other guy's name?
[03:26:01.679 --> 03:26:05.923]  You know, in the meetings where they say, you've got to resign, and then he goes, I want to talk to the president, and it's not true.
[03:26:07.161 --> 03:26:21.246]  Anthony Scaramucci, well thought of in conservative and Trump supporter circles, hanging in limbo even as we speak, appointed a liaison to the business community by the President, but yet to be sworn in.
[03:26:21.886 --> 03:26:31.350]  Again, Reince Priebus is jealous of the fact that Anthony Scaramucci has a direct personal relationship with the President and can communicate with him.
[03:26:31.710 --> 03:26:33.871]  That was the same problem with General Flynn.
[03:26:34.591 --> 03:26:39.113]  Mr. Pribis would like to be the source of all information for the President.
[03:26:39.533 --> 03:26:42.454]  And that shows he doesn't know Donald Trump.
[03:26:42.474 --> 03:26:43.395]  Well, it's clear now.
[03:26:43.495 --> 03:26:46.416]  It all just crystallized with Trump's statements and everything.
[03:26:46.816 --> 03:26:47.496]  It was a Pribus.
[03:26:47.536 --> 03:26:48.036]  They admit it.
[03:26:48.056 --> 03:26:48.797]  They went to Flynn.
[03:26:49.577 --> 03:26:52.220]  Basically, the Vice President went to him and they said, okay, you're bad.
[03:26:52.240 --> 03:26:53.702]  And Flynn said, okay, I haven't done anything wrong.
[03:26:53.942 --> 03:26:56.566]  But if I didn't answer perfectly here, I'd just resign.
[03:26:57.006 --> 03:27:00.911]  It looks like they manipulated him into resigning, but maybe it'll turn out good.
[03:27:00.931 --> 03:27:01.892]  Now Trump is on.
[03:27:01.932 --> 03:27:02.353]  I've never seen it.
[03:27:02.373 --> 03:27:03.915]  He's like, Flynn's really wonderful.
[03:27:04.135 --> 03:27:04.836]  He's a great guy.
[03:27:04.876 --> 03:27:05.897]  This is horrible this happened.
[03:27:06.478 --> 03:27:07.279]  This looks really bad.
[03:27:08.646 --> 03:27:18.091]  Well, look, I'm hoping that General Flynn remains in the public eye, remains in public life, and will continue speaking out, because I think he still has a very valuable role to play.
[03:27:18.972 --> 03:27:34.300]  And then, Alex, this whole week gets topped off by picking up the newspaper this morning and reading, in order to coincide with this Flynn flap, the New York Times essentially recycled their story from June 20th,
[03:27:35.450 --> 03:27:50.680]  Reiterating again the completely bogus and false allegation that Paul Manafort, my former partner, chairman of the Trump campaign during the summer and into the convention, and that I... We're continuously in communication.
[03:27:50.900 --> 03:27:53.262]  It's continuously is the headline at CNN.
[03:27:53.862 --> 03:27:56.004]  Continuously in communication with the Russians.
[03:27:56.364 --> 03:27:58.005]  And Manafort says, I'm boggled.
[03:27:58.065 --> 03:27:59.026]  I talk to no one.
[03:28:00.026 --> 03:28:08.691]  No, look, my wife called minutes ago, she saw my photo flash up on CNN, and she said, wait a minute, you didn't talk to any Russians, did you?
[03:28:09.252 --> 03:28:10.232]  And you know the answer.
[03:28:10.733 --> 03:28:14.275]  Absolutely, categorically, not.
[03:28:14.295 --> 03:28:28.344]  I spoke to no Russians, no intermediaries for the Russians, no representatives of the Russians, I have no Russian clients, no Russian contacts, no Russian money, and I have never spoken to anybody in Russia or for Russia.
[03:28:29.164 --> 03:28:34.312]  They're targeting everybody they know who are good advisors off the record to Trump and saying they've been spotted as potential Russians.
[03:28:34.692 --> 03:28:35.834]  You can't talk to them now.
[03:28:36.354 --> 03:28:37.596]  And O'Flynn's a Russian.
[03:28:37.616 --> 03:28:39.439]  And now Michael Moore says Trump's a Russian.
[03:28:39.819 --> 03:28:41.963]  And at a certain point, he's the president.
[03:28:42.203 --> 03:28:43.204]  He can talk to whoever he wants.
[03:28:43.224 --> 03:28:45.227]  This is a load of horse manure.
[03:28:45.808 --> 03:28:52.315]  And he's got to just go ahead and just point out it is and start an investigation of Hillary with the Saudi Arabians and commie Chinese.
[03:28:52.355 --> 03:28:53.797]  I think the answer's the offense.
[03:28:53.817 --> 03:28:57.481]  I'm going to turn the baton over to you, my friend, but your book's available at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:28:57.701 --> 03:29:01.605]  We have a new caveman bone broth supplement, chocolate flavor, the total game changer.
[03:29:01.625 --> 03:29:02.326]  Check that out, folks.
[03:29:02.346 --> 03:29:04.248]  But Roger, I mean, what does Trump do?
[03:29:04.268 --> 03:29:05.169]  Doesn't he go on the offense?
[03:29:06.323 --> 03:29:10.305]  He needs to not only go in the off-lens, Alex, but he needs to clean house.
[03:29:10.985 --> 03:29:12.666]  He needs to clean house at the White House.
[03:29:13.206 --> 03:29:28.954]  There are many, many capable Republican operatives who were for Donald Trump from the beginning, who sacrificed to help get him elected, who are more than capable of handling these mechanical jobs at the White House.
[03:29:29.494 --> 03:29:42.879]  There are many fine people who could be assistant secretaries and deputy secretaries in the departments, who are capable individuals, who supported Donald Trump from the beginning, who share his worldview.
[03:29:43.399 --> 03:29:45.479]  We need to repopulate this administration.
[03:29:45.559 --> 03:29:50.481]  Absolutely, and just get rid of the Paul Ryan tentacle, Mr. Penis, excuse me, Mr. Priebus.
[03:29:50.841 --> 03:29:51.301]  We'll be back.
[03:29:51.341 --> 03:29:52.282]  Roger Stone takes over.
[03:29:52.322 --> 03:29:53.602]  Now it's 9, 7 o'clock Central.
[03:29:53.702 --> 03:29:55.303]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:56.243 --> 03:29:58.924]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:03.254 --> 03:30:09.424]  People have asked me for 20 years, Alex, why don't you have firearms and firearms accessory sponsors?
[03:30:09.985 --> 03:30:11.387]  And the answer is, it's a minefield.
[03:30:12.304 --> 03:30:14.205]  Well, in 2016, things changed.
[03:30:14.786 --> 03:30:20.349]  And Tennessee Arms, that is the founders, the inventors, the leaders, they defended it in court.
[03:30:20.930 --> 03:30:28.935]  Of the resin lowers, with the brass inserts, that in many cases go further than even aluminum or steel manufacturing.
[03:30:29.355 --> 03:30:31.397]  30,000 to 60,000 rounds by third-party reviewers.
[03:30:31.697 --> 03:30:32.898]  This is the best system out there.
[03:30:33.158 --> 03:30:35.920]  And we're talking a third the price of leading competitors.
[03:30:36.160 --> 03:30:36.920]  This is how it works.
[03:30:37.201 --> 03:30:37.721]  You order.
[03:30:37.841 --> 03:30:38.641]  Customized or
[03:30:39.722 --> 03:30:41.203]  Straight from the factory, however you want it.
[03:30:41.683 --> 03:30:44.825]  It is shipped on the next business day to you and your family.
[03:30:45.125 --> 03:30:49.187]  And a percentage of the profit goes to fund the defense of this republic.
[03:30:49.428 --> 03:30:50.188]  You cannot lose.
[03:30:50.208 --> 03:30:51.309]  You're funding the Infowar.
[03:30:51.629 --> 03:30:58.372]  You're getting the highest quality product, the most tested, the most durable, the most certified, the most believed in.
[03:30:58.693 --> 03:31:02.635]  You need to have this true piece of America ready in minutes.
[03:31:03.235 --> 03:31:08.359]  The military industrial complex is trying to sabotage Donald Trump.
[03:31:08.519 --> 03:31:12.621]  Last night, National Security Advisor Michael Flynn officially resigned.
[03:31:12.661 --> 03:31:17.825]  This following reports that he had misled officials about his contacts with Russia.
[03:31:17.885 --> 03:31:25.010]  Meanwhile, the establishment media says this validates their conspiracy theory that Russia hacked the U.S.
[03:31:25.090 --> 03:31:25.550]  elections.
[03:31:25.690 --> 03:31:31.994]  They're also claiming that General Flynn's conversation with the Russian ambassador is a violation of the Logan Act.
[03:31:32.194 --> 03:31:32.875]  But wait a minute.
[03:31:33.175 --> 03:31:36.636]  Where was the mainstream media during the Bilderberg conferences?
[03:31:36.856 --> 03:31:46.459]  You know, the secret group of global elitists ignored by the mainstream media as they privately meet each year to plan and coordinate global policy.
[03:31:46.759 --> 03:31:55.701]  Look, the establishment wants to purge the Trump administration and replace them with compromised Washington insiders and globalists.
[03:31:55.821 --> 03:31:58.982]  In other words, they are trying to refill the swamp.
[03:31:59.282 --> 03:32:01.723]  You can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[03:32:12.808 --> 03:32:20.736]  Anthony Gucciardi joins us to talk about Bio PCA, the latest formula to be announced and released by Infowarslife.com.
[03:32:20.796 --> 03:32:23.879]  They're true game changers, they're organic, they're proven as safe.
[03:32:24.690 --> 03:32:26.510]  And they're also very affordable.
[03:32:26.530 --> 03:32:26.870]  Exactly.
[03:32:26.890 --> 03:32:28.671]  You talk about being a game changer, right?
[03:32:28.691 --> 03:32:32.032]  You talk about we're in an industry where we talk to the industry leaders.
[03:32:32.072 --> 03:32:33.352]  We've both talked to them.
[03:32:33.532 --> 03:32:42.494]  They have individuals that are hired only to save money and get the lowest quality junk and put it in as many capsules as possible so they can make the highest profit margins.
[03:32:43.374 --> 03:32:44.454]  We refuse to screw people.
[03:32:44.814 --> 03:32:45.774]  We refuse to do that.
[03:32:46.154 --> 03:32:48.135]  We actually want to make something that's good.
[03:32:48.675 --> 03:32:55.431]  Went on what Mother Nature gave us, and it's changed my life, and it's also helped the Infowar change the country and the world.
[03:32:55.832 --> 03:32:56.593]  It's a win-win.
[03:32:57.074 --> 03:32:57.836]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:33:14.236 --> 03:33:15.819]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:16.139 --> 03:33:21.327]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:26.823 --> 03:33:28.624]  Welcome back to InfoWars.
[03:33:29.184 --> 03:33:33.366]  I have just picked up the torch from the great Alex Jones for the Balance of Power.
[03:33:34.347 --> 03:33:37.768]  And joining me now is Andrew Kerr of the Citizens Audit.
[03:33:38.308 --> 03:33:49.434]  Talk about one of my favorite subjects, a weasel that we need to keep our eyes on very carefully, and that is the former conservative flip-flop artist and liberal hitman, David Brock.
[03:33:50.054 --> 03:34:00.377]  Now, Mr. Brock fronts a number of organizations that he claims are monitors of the media or monitors of public ethics.
[03:34:00.958 --> 03:34:04.739]  But in fact, these are all propaganda organizations designed to
[03:34:05.239 --> 03:34:22.715]  Cover up the many crimes of Bill and Hillary and Chelsea Clinton into hurl invective and personal insults, smears as it were, against anybody who has the courage to speak out against the Clintons or the political status quo in Washington.
[03:34:23.556 --> 03:34:35.324]  I estimate that Mr. Brock probably burned through perhaps 30 to 40 million dollars in the last election, having absolutely, positively nothing to show for it.
[03:34:36.144 --> 03:34:50.970]  Now comes amazing new research by Dr. Jerome Corsi showing that Brock is in bed with both Google and Facebook attempting to censor critics of the Clintons and advocates for President Trump.
[03:34:51.370 --> 03:35:00.814]  So to help us keep an eye on what illegal activity Mr. Brock is involved in now, Andrew Kerr joins us from Citizens Audit.
[03:35:00.934 --> 03:35:04.736]  Welcome, Andrew, to InfoWars.com.
[03:35:05.595 --> 03:35:06.056]  Thanks, Roger.
[03:35:06.116 --> 03:35:07.498]  It's an honor to be speaking with you right now.
[03:35:08.639 --> 03:35:16.450]  So you have done some extraordinary work, and I always enjoy reading the updates on your site.
[03:35:16.931 --> 03:35:22.198]  Tell our listeners who Mr. Brock is, where he came from, and what he's done.
[03:35:23.410 --> 03:35:27.314]  He's a, like you said, he's a former conservative author.
[03:35:27.434 --> 03:35:30.577]  He wrote the true story of Anita Hill back in the early 90s.
[03:35:31.398 --> 03:35:35.743]  And he was commissioned to essentially write a hit piece on Hillary Clinton.
[03:35:36.464 --> 03:35:37.885]  Yeah, on the Clintons in the late 90s.
[03:35:40.027 --> 03:35:42.449]  And he came out of that being a staunch ally of them.
[03:35:42.669 --> 03:35:55.640]  He did a total ideological switch, ended up founding an organization called Media Matters for America, a supposed watchdog, a conservative media watchdog, information fact checker.
[03:35:56.421 --> 03:36:06.489]  And since then, he's got a total of 14 entities that he's running out of his office space, a variety of supposed nonprofits,
[03:36:07.170 --> 03:36:15.777]  Foundations and super PACs that were working directly with the Clinton campaign during this previous election season.
[03:36:16.358 --> 03:36:20.041]  And yeah, he probably did burn through it, you know, 30 or $40 million.
[03:36:20.321 --> 03:36:28.328]  And just a couple weeks ago, he was asking for another $40 million from his network of donors, you know, for round two.
[03:36:28.388 --> 03:36:30.510]  Now that, you know, now that Trump is in power.
[03:36:31.991 --> 03:36:35.837]  Well, evidently his manifesto leaked.
[03:36:36.698 --> 03:36:38.000]  I've seen a copy of it.
[03:36:38.701 --> 03:36:40.223]  Dr. Corsi's seen a copy of it.
[03:36:40.243 --> 03:36:42.426]  I know you have seen a copy of it.
[03:36:42.486 --> 03:36:43.748]  It's quite grandiose.
[03:36:43.788 --> 03:36:48.154]  He takes enormous credit for things that, in fact, he had nothing to do with.
[03:36:48.995 --> 03:37:01.165]  It's amazing to me that based on my calculation, Bill and Hillary Clinton probably spent upwards of two billion dollars in their efforts to seize the White House.
[03:37:02.386 --> 03:37:14.496]  The cost of the mainstream media coverage of the campaign, which was really one long Hillary Clinton commercial, that in itself is millions of dollars.
[03:37:14.936 --> 03:37:17.038]  Now you figure in the manipulations of
[03:37:17.478 --> 03:37:20.539]  Facebook, the manipulations of Google.
[03:37:21.160 --> 03:37:27.182]  It's really a miracle that Donald Trump won, given all that he faced.
[03:37:27.203 --> 03:37:34.586]  I am under the impression that, based on a very comprehensive and well-drafted complaint at the Federal Election Commission,
[03:37:35.206 --> 03:37:44.673]  That Mr. Brock has broken multiple laws, that he's been shuffling money between non-profit entities, hard money entities, and so on.
[03:37:44.913 --> 03:37:45.474]  I know this.
[03:37:46.154 --> 03:37:49.837]  If I did this, or if you did, Andrew, we'd already be in jail.
[03:37:51.587 --> 03:37:55.411]  Exactly, and that's the problem, is that we have Media Matters for America.
[03:37:55.431 --> 03:37:56.392]  It's a charity.
[03:37:56.572 --> 03:37:59.495]  It's supposed to be a charitable organization.
[03:38:00.215 --> 03:38:03.899]  And here's a snip from their fundraising document from a couple weeks ago.
[03:38:04.459 --> 03:38:09.624]  Media Matters has already secured access to raw data from Facebook, Twitter, and social media sites.
[03:38:10.345 --> 03:38:15.507]  We will now develop technologies and processes to systematically monitor and analyze this unfiltered data.
[03:38:15.907 --> 03:38:23.410]  So they have a line into social media sites in order to review the data, analyze it, data mine it.
[03:38:23.931 --> 03:38:25.531]  And here's what they plan to do with it.
[03:38:25.791 --> 03:38:26.872]  This is their top outcomes.
[03:38:26.992 --> 03:38:29.093]  Over the next four years, Media Matters will focus
[03:38:30.012 --> 03:38:37.218]  On exposing serial misinformers and right-wing propagandists inhabiting everything from social media to the highest levels of government.
[03:38:38.119 --> 03:38:45.426]  Internet and social media platforms will no longer uncritically and without consequence host and enrich fake news sites and propagandists.
[03:38:46.006 --> 03:38:53.593]  So what they're saying is, you know, it's one thing to go after Roger Stone, which they have, and we'll get to that in a second.
[03:38:54.133 --> 03:39:01.320]  But what they're saying is that they're going to go after individuals on social media if they determine those people to be serial misinformers.
[03:39:01.780 --> 03:39:06.644]  And we have to ask ourselves, is that what a charitable organization should be doing?
[03:39:06.724 --> 03:39:11.389]  We have people that are donating money and they're deducting that from their tax returns.
[03:39:11.991 --> 03:39:26.925]  And they also talk about, they brag about how they targeted you, Roger, saying that we put pressure on CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News, and due to our pressure, they stopped booking Roger Stone on their shows.
[03:39:27.025 --> 03:39:32.510]  So these shows wanted to have you on, and then Media Matters came in and said, no, his views are unacceptable.
[03:39:33.365 --> 03:39:35.406]  Don't book him anymore, or we're going to put pressure on you.
[03:39:35.426 --> 03:39:50.612]  We're going to put pressure on advertisers to stop booking with you in an effort to silence you instead of allowing you to debate and let the merits of your ideas and thoughts judge what you're saying.
[03:39:51.252 --> 03:39:56.614]  They want to silence people that are saying things against the status quo that they want out there.
[03:39:57.254 --> 03:40:00.495]  And you were speaking to Alex Jones before about Twitter.
[03:40:00.976 --> 03:40:01.476]  If you look at
[03:40:02.398 --> 03:40:02.798]  I think so.
[03:40:19.105 --> 03:40:32.150]  It shouldn't be a stretch of the imagination that they're pressuring Twitter to filter the view on the site to show only negative comments to Trump, creating this false illusion that 100% of Americans
[03:40:33.760 --> 03:40:34.680]  Are against Trump.
[03:40:34.820 --> 03:40:43.143]  So perspectives of pro-Trump supporters are just not being seen by the greater media or by the population.
[03:40:43.743 --> 03:40:54.386]  And then we get into the situation where, you know, there's millions of people, millions of Americans that believe that everybody that voted for Trump is a Nazi racist xenophobe, which is just not true.
[03:40:55.387 --> 03:41:00.551]  Well, I think they've actually made a mistake, because you see, the President follows his Twitter feed religiously.
[03:41:01.532 --> 03:41:08.278]  And he's a highly intelligent, in fact, brilliant man, who will quickly realize that the responses are being manipulated.
[03:41:08.838 --> 03:41:12.742]  So I think this will open a window to a broader understanding of what
[03:41:13.382 --> 03:41:15.764]  Brock and the extreme left are up to.
[03:41:16.324 --> 03:41:31.276]  As far as their successful efforts to censor me, and some kind of Stalinistic-like censorship, in all honesty, I would never have met and affiliated with InfoWars and Alex Jones if I was regularly appearing on Fox.
[03:41:31.636 --> 03:41:36.841]  So they have done me an enormous favor, and based on my studying of the data, Andrew,
[03:41:37.521 --> 03:41:44.205]  You and I are reaching far more people right now than CNN or Fox in this same time frame.
[03:41:44.705 --> 03:41:51.529]  So, in essence, these attacks on us have only made us stronger.
[03:41:52.809 --> 03:42:00.674]  I understood that Mr. Brock was trying to seek some formal role in deciding what is fake news.
[03:42:00.834 --> 03:42:10.179]  And that's laughable, because virtually everything he and his twisted little psycho-fancy media matters crank out is the fake news.
[03:42:10.559 --> 03:42:12.480]  They are the purveyors of fake news.
[03:42:12.860 --> 03:42:15.862]  They may be the inventors of fake news.
[03:42:16.222 --> 03:42:16.763]  What say you?
[03:42:17.723 --> 03:42:19.224]  Yeah, I hear you.
[03:42:19.345 --> 03:42:21.026]  It's backfired dramatically.
[03:42:21.326 --> 03:42:33.316]  I honestly think that if it wasn't for David Brock's conglomerate of organizations aggressively targeting conservative viewpoints on the internet, then Hillary Clinton may have won.
[03:42:33.797 --> 03:42:39.822]  I think that it totally backfired, and it's kind of hysterical to see him trying to do the same exact thing.
[03:42:40.782 --> 03:42:41.923]  Obviously, he hasn't learned his lesson.
[03:42:44.918 --> 03:42:52.720]  On the other end, though, a large majority of Americans, a significant percentage of Americans get their news from Facebook and Twitter.
[03:42:53.301 --> 03:43:00.803]  So whether or not people would like the news that is being produced by alternative media sources such as InfoWars,
[03:43:01.761 --> 03:43:11.289]  What Media Matters is trying to do is to just make those posts, those links to any alternative news sites just not show up at all.
[03:43:11.329 --> 03:43:20.898]  So even if somebody wants to see that news, see that insight, they, I mean, how can you find something if you don't even know what you're looking for?
[03:43:20.958 --> 03:43:21.878]  So they just want to, you know,
[03:43:27.060 --> 03:43:51.526]  What's particularly interesting to me is given David Brock's long record of ineffectiveness and the fact that he spent a huge amount of money and achieved virtually nothing, particularly given the enormous built-in institutional advantages of his candidate, I can't imagine why any rich liberal would give him 10 cents.
[03:43:52.606 --> 03:43:55.607]  In fact, if I were George Soros, I'd be demanding a refund.
[03:43:56.127 --> 03:43:57.348]  This guy's an incompetent.
[03:43:57.768 --> 03:44:01.289]  He lets his boyfriend run the organization, by and large.
[03:44:01.789 --> 03:44:04.490]  He has been caught cheating on his taxes.
[03:44:05.011 --> 03:44:09.372]  Look, I owe the IRS some money, but I have a payment plan, and I pay them every month.
[03:44:09.732 --> 03:44:11.313]  And it hurts, I assure you.
[03:44:11.793 --> 03:44:16.975]  But Mr. Brock is not in that situation, as has been widely reported.
[03:44:17.455 --> 03:44:20.716]  So, look, I think that he's breaking multiple laws.
[03:44:21.256 --> 03:44:27.139]  I think it's perfectly understandable why the Obama Justice Department hasn't looked at him.
[03:44:27.939 --> 03:44:34.241]  But if we're really going to have equal protection under the law, then frankly, I think he should be brought to justice.
[03:44:34.701 --> 03:44:44.085]  Not for his political ideas, but for the fact that he's cheating and that he's violating federal election laws in this incredible effort to smear
[03:44:44.805 --> 03:44:49.247]  In all honesty, I'm tired of being called a racist.
[03:44:49.768 --> 03:44:57.472]  I was out working against the racist Rockefeller drug laws in New York State before David Brock was in long pants.
[03:44:58.638 --> 03:45:08.202]  I was helping Richard Nixon desegregate the public schools without violence before David Brock was a gleam in his father's eye.
[03:45:08.863 --> 03:45:18.987]  So this name-calling, bigot, racist, and so on, it is what the left does when they can't refute your ideas with facts.
[03:45:20.008 --> 03:45:24.170]  It is really beneath our national political dialogue.
[03:45:24.963 --> 03:45:25.725]  That's my view.
[03:45:26.186 --> 03:45:28.631]  Where do you think Mr. Brock goes from here, Andrew?
[03:45:28.651 --> 03:45:33.041]  Because I know you are wisely keeping a very close eye on him.
[03:45:34.090 --> 03:45:42.934]  Well, about six months ago I started looking into his organizations because all of a sudden there was all this astroturfing online.
[03:45:43.675 --> 03:45:47.397]  It looked like paid comments, pro-Hillary Clinton comments online.
[03:45:47.857 --> 03:45:56.641]  And it turns out that David Brock's, one of his super PACs, Correct the Record, was essentially correcting Hillary Clinton's record online.
[03:45:58.382 --> 03:46:09.147]  We're out in the open saying that, hey, we're a super PAC, but since we don't make any paid advertisements on TV or on the radio, we just stick with online communications, we can directly coordinate with the Clinton campaign.
[03:46:09.547 --> 03:46:20.213]  So we can wait for orders from the top and then distribute the message on, on internet forums, uh, across the internet, creating this false illusion that a lot of people like Hillary Clinton, when that just wasn't the case.
[03:46:20.453 --> 03:46:23.714]  So, you know, that goes to backfiring against what his intentions were.
[03:46:24.315 --> 03:46:26.436]  But the, the problem here and what, what I'm.
[03:46:27.409 --> 03:46:43.401]  Looking into my investigation is trying to unravel the complex relationship between his up to 14 separate entities that are all sharing office space with Media Matters in downtown Washington, DC.
[03:46:44.042 --> 03:46:45.903]  And it's extremely complex.
[03:46:45.963 --> 03:46:46.644]  And we talk about
[03:46:47.540 --> 03:46:49.282]  You know, submitting an official complaint.
[03:46:49.823 --> 03:46:58.454]  Well, the problem is on the right, there isn't really much infrastructure for groups that focus on litigation against liberal groups that may be breaking the law.
[03:46:58.574 --> 03:47:04.781]  There's no real, you know, there's not a network of organizations that focus on that type of thing.
[03:47:05.711 --> 03:47:08.793]  The Federal Election Commission is completely incompetent.
[03:47:09.194 --> 03:47:12.216]  They have no idea how to enforce the current laws, period.
[03:47:12.376 --> 03:47:18.601]  They regularly deadlock whenever an organization will ask the Federal Election Commission, hey, is it okay if we can do this?
[03:47:19.442 --> 03:47:22.665]  And they'll spend a year working on the decision and they'll come back saying,
[03:47:23.598 --> 03:47:23.718]  Is it?
[03:47:38.425 --> 03:47:38.645]  At least
[03:47:54.984 --> 03:48:05.148]  Out in the open, and he's protected by none other than just the complex relationship between multiple nonprofits, foundations, and super PACs all working together under one.
[03:48:06.108 --> 03:48:11.210]  It's really just one single entity, but they claim to be 14 separate related organizations.
[03:48:11.890 --> 03:48:20.233]  And my most recent research is focused on analyzing cost sharing agreements between the separate organizations and issues that are surrounding that.
[03:48:20.373 --> 03:48:22.474]  And it's a very big story.
[03:48:23.214 --> 03:48:26.956]  But it's just so hard to talk about because it's just so complicated.
[03:48:28.237 --> 03:48:31.638]  And so that's what I've been looking into.
[03:48:31.699 --> 03:48:37.281]  I think that if the work on my site, the Citizens Audit, gets out,
[03:48:38.482 --> 03:48:45.244]  And we have, you know, and we start a conversation around the operations of Media Matters and the relationship with political entities.
[03:48:45.884 --> 03:49:01.349]  It would be a very big issue for David Brock because there's a significant amount of disconcerting things that they're doing with their money that, at the very least, should trigger the IRS to come in, take a look at their books, and determine, hey, should Media Matters be a charitable organization?
[03:49:01.369 --> 03:49:05.111]  I believe that they have lost
[03:49:07.344 --> 03:49:20.552]  Any reason to be designated as a as a charitable organization that should be revoked and they should be liable for back taxes for all the time that they've been claiming to be a charitable organization, but in reality just operating like a political organization.
[03:49:20.572 --> 03:49:27.156]  Yeah, they've clearly violated their current tax status and they should be held liable.
[03:49:27.836 --> 03:49:30.418]  You may remember back when I published my book.
[03:49:31.568 --> 03:49:41.118]  The Clinton's war on women, which was the definitive oppo dump on Bill Hillary and Chelsea Clinton and their various illegal activities.
[03:49:41.638 --> 03:49:45.963]  There was a major effort to invade the Amazon.com page.
[03:49:46.463 --> 03:49:53.789]  To allay a disproportionate number of one star and no star reviews of my book.
[03:49:54.349 --> 03:49:58.272]  Most of them we were able to track back to Brock and his minions.
[03:49:58.973 --> 03:50:04.237]  Now on Amazon there's evidence that this is beginning again pertaining to my new book.
[03:50:05.057 --> 03:50:10.680]  The Making of the President 2016, How Donald Trump Orchestrated an American Revolution.
[03:50:11.201 --> 03:50:23.327]  So this is as good a time as any to ask folks who are tuned in today, who like the book, please go to Amazon and leave an objective review for others to see.
[03:50:23.788 --> 03:50:32.933]  This is more important than you might think because the wholesale book retailers and others monitor Amazon very closely
[03:50:33.553 --> 03:50:37.474]  To see what the reviews look like before they decide to order.
[03:50:39.834 --> 03:50:42.355]  I think we have our music here.
[03:50:43.855 --> 03:50:47.296]  If somebody can show me the clock, we can see what we've got here.
[03:50:47.356 --> 03:50:57.779]  But I want to thank you, Andrew, for the work you're doing at Citizens Audit and the excellent job you are doing focusing on David Brock.
[03:50:58.919 --> 03:50:59.339]  Thank you so much.
[03:51:03.151 --> 03:51:05.353]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[03:51:05.714 --> 03:51:17.726]  The missing link of why our ancestors, whether you were in Africa or ancient Albion, which is England today, why our ancestors were so much stronger.
[03:51:17.746 --> 03:51:22.891]  I mean, there are huge archaeological reports, all sorts of anthropology studies.
[03:51:22.911 --> 03:51:24.052]  You can look them up for yourself.
[03:51:24.733 --> 03:51:34.441]  That show that humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[03:51:34.581 --> 03:51:40.746]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[03:51:41.627 --> 03:51:43.488]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[03:51:44.469 --> 03:51:45.690]  People are falling apart.
[03:51:45.750 --> 03:51:46.731]  They're totally depressed.
[03:51:46.751 --> 03:51:47.291]  They're unhappy.
[03:51:47.872 --> 03:51:48.853]  What is going on?
[03:51:50.114 --> 03:51:53.977]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[03:51:55.202 --> 03:51:57.785]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[03:51:58.165 --> 03:51:59.867]  Today, we call it bone broth.
[03:52:00.067 --> 03:52:07.095]  And for thousands of years, our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets of processed junk.
[03:52:07.315 --> 03:52:15.644]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWars Life products.
[03:52:17.051 --> 03:52:23.536]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[03:52:23.937 --> 03:52:27.339]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[03:52:27.379 --> 03:52:30.522]  You used the skin to cover yourself for shelter.
[03:52:31.123 --> 03:52:36.207]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[03:52:36.727 --> 03:52:39.868]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:52:40.168 --> 03:52:50.593]  The ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric roots, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[03:52:50.713 --> 03:52:52.153]  The bone is so amazing.
[03:52:52.574 --> 03:52:58.176]  From the outside structure full of minerals and kecofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[03:52:59.298 --> 03:53:02.220]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[03:53:02.760 --> 03:53:08.203]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[03:53:08.463 --> 03:53:17.947]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[03:53:18.208 --> 03:53:22.770]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[03:53:23.010 --> 03:53:24.791]  This is a absolute win-win.
[03:53:24.871 --> 03:53:27.631]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
[03:53:27.912 --> 03:53:34.033]  You support InfoWars and all we're doing to promote freedom and the restoration of our Republic and promotion of freedom worldwide.
[03:53:35.314 --> 03:53:44.037]  The journey towards better health and giving our bodies these amazing compounds that God created starts at infowarslife.com.
[03:53:44.217 --> 03:53:48.618]  Three years in the making, incredible research, and the very best ingredients.
[03:53:49.138 --> 03:53:51.739]  I'm Alex Jones, and I may not be a caveman,
[03:53:52.469 --> 03:53:55.734]  But compared to these trendies out there in the street, I'm as close as it gets.
[03:53:56.154 --> 03:53:59.559]  Join me at InfoWarsLive.com and get your caveman formula today.
[03:54:13.615 --> 03:54:17.959]  Welcome back to InfoWars, I'm Roger Stone sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:54:17.999 --> 03:54:34.395]  This is a very good time to remind you that freedom isn't free and that the very fine products at the InfoWars store are really what fund this effort to bring you the real news and to bring you the first-rate investigative journalism of
[03:54:34.935 --> 03:54:39.296]  People like Paul Joseph Watson, Dr. Jerome Corsi, and so many others.
[03:54:40.276 --> 03:54:58.101]  My wife, who is very intent on not only oral health, but having a gleaming smile, is an enormous fan of the Super Blue Fluoride toothpaste that you can now get again at the InfoWars.com store.
[03:54:58.501 --> 03:55:00.262]  Now, this has been sold out for months.
[03:55:00.902 --> 03:55:02.803]  But now, it's available again.
[03:55:02.823 --> 03:55:09.387]  And research across the board indicates that this does more than just cosmetic value.
[03:55:09.747 --> 03:55:19.553]  This has a health value because healthy gums contribute to overall health and help prevent both heart disease and heart attacks.
[03:55:20.114 --> 03:55:28.639]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can actually enter the bloodstream and therefore contribute to blood clots or heart attacks.
[03:55:30.188 --> 03:55:40.694]  I must tell you, Mrs. Stone is very, very particular about the oral products that she uses, and she swears by Super Blue Fluoride Toothpaste.
[03:55:41.054 --> 03:55:45.637]  So here's a chance for a win-win situation.
[03:55:46.177 --> 03:55:54.582]  You can get a product on the Infowars store, in this case, Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste, and you can help the revolution.
[03:55:55.242 --> 03:56:00.906]  There are literally hundreds of testimonials from people about the efficacy of this product.
[03:56:01.006 --> 03:56:02.968]  So please, grab it now.
[03:56:04.009 --> 03:56:10.033]  I'm going to buy some of the new caveman formula, although I'm afraid they might start calling me that if I do.
[03:56:10.894 --> 03:56:13.255]  In any event, please, go to the site.
[03:56:13.676 --> 03:56:15.457]  You can buy this terrific product.
[03:56:15.857 --> 03:56:24.064]  And frankly, it's also the best place to get your copy of The Making of the President 2016, How Donald Trump
[03:56:25.057 --> 03:56:26.898]  Orchestrated in American Revolution.
[03:56:26.958 --> 03:56:34.801]  Now, as is widely known, I have pledged to sign the book of everyone who buys the book here at InfoWars.
[03:56:35.282 --> 03:56:37.843]  And yes, that pledge is still good.
[03:56:38.263 --> 03:56:40.284]  And yes, my wrist hurts.
[03:56:40.644 --> 03:56:44.846]  And yes, I am signing thousands of book plates a day.
[03:56:45.800 --> 03:56:49.061]  And your commitment, your fulfillment will come.
[03:56:49.701 --> 03:56:51.041]  I beg your indulgence.
[03:56:51.221 --> 03:56:52.361]  I beg your patience.
[03:56:52.962 --> 03:56:58.083]  I had no idea that the book would sell this widely on InfoWars.
[03:56:58.403 --> 03:57:07.144]  But I want everyone who is an InfoWars watcher or listener to get this special edition signed by me.
[03:57:07.164 --> 03:57:11.565]  I understand Alex Jones is going to sign many of these books as well.
[03:57:12.065 --> 03:57:14.226]  I want this to be a special thanks
[03:57:14.966 --> 03:57:18.028]  To those who loyally follow InfoWars.
[03:57:18.508 --> 03:57:18.869]  Why?
[03:57:19.309 --> 03:57:22.991]  Because you are the backbone of the Trump revolution.
[03:57:23.352 --> 03:57:27.594]  Because you are on the cutting edge of stopping the globalists.
[03:57:28.275 --> 03:57:34.039]  You deserve the accolades of your fellow patriots.
[03:57:34.359 --> 03:57:44.826]  And if you will buy this book at InfoWars, even though it's available elsewhere, I pledge to you, even though it may take some time, you will get your personally autographed
[03:57:45.766 --> 03:57:51.189]  A copy of the book, something I hope that you will share with your friends and family.
[03:57:52.169 --> 03:57:56.951]  There is no place like InfoWars when it comes to the real news.
[03:57:57.811 --> 03:57:59.112]  We're in a struggle, folks.
[03:57:59.792 --> 03:58:02.293]  A struggle for the future of Western civilization.
[03:58:02.873 --> 03:58:04.714]  A struggle for our freedoms.
[03:58:05.434 --> 03:58:14.118]  You have seen in the last 48 hours the extent to which the two-party duopoly and the insiders who have driven this country into the gutter
[03:58:14.858 --> 03:58:18.060]  ...are prepared to smear and violate the law.
[03:58:18.721 --> 03:58:33.932]  So, I say, God bless Alex Jones, God bless our president, Donald J. Trump, and God bless you for following InfoWars and being the tip of the spear when it comes to the resistance.
[03:58:45.566 --> 03:58:49.553]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:58:54.119 --> 03:59:05.464]  Billionaire leftist George Soros is calling for a cashless society to establish a world government where your every expense will be monitored.
[03:59:05.784 --> 03:59:15.909]  Meanwhile, former NSA head turned whistleblower William Binney, in an interview with Alex Jones, said the spy grid is part of a world government takeover.
[03:59:16.049 --> 03:59:21.391]  Certainly it is population control, but not just of any given country, but of the world.
[03:59:21.611 --> 03:59:23.292]  I think that's probably what they're after.
[03:59:23.312 --> 03:59:26.133]  In order to do that, they have to be able to control the people of the world.
[03:59:26.534 --> 03:59:37.358]  Now, despite assurances made by governments that the replacement of cash with a digital currency will make all our lives easier, experts and whistleblowers disagree.
[03:59:37.538 --> 03:59:41.640]  They say the cashless society is one big giant distraction.
[03:59:41.800 --> 03:59:43.341]  To cover up the real agenda,
[03:59:43.681 --> 03:59:46.165]  Of a worldwide surveillance state.
[03:59:46.445 --> 03:59:50.631]  I'm Darren McBreen and you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[03:59:54.857 --> 03:59:58.883]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
