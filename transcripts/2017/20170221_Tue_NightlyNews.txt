[00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:20.735]  Welcome to the Info Wars Nightly News.
[00:00:20.775 --> 00:00:25.024]  It is Tuesday, February 21st, 2017 and I'm Leanne McAdoo.
[00:00:25.164 --> 00:00:26.146]  Here's what's coming up tonight.
[00:00:31.013 --> 00:00:39.059]  InfoWars is under attack and we have been banned from one of the largest advertisement platforms in the world.
[00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:43.261]  That's because of our political support of President Donald Trump.
[00:00:43.522 --> 00:00:47.864]  This is an unprecedented attack on the Liberty Movement and free speech.
[00:00:48.565 --> 00:00:51.527]  You can bet your ass we're about to fight back.
[00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:54.188]  Man, I don't care if somebody breaks into my car and steals my stereo.
[00:00:54.508 --> 00:00:55.929]  It's not that it's a $200 stereo.
[00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:56.989]  It's my windows knocked out.
[00:00:57.209 --> 00:00:58.169]  They violated me.
[00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.730]  I'm pissed.
[00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.071]  I am 50 times more pissed about this because they're trying to steal my birthright.
[00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:12.615]  Meanwhile, Reddit is now blocking pro-Trump forums from its homepage as the establishment's crackdown on the First Amendment accelerates.
[00:01:16.456 --> 00:01:20.858]  All that plus much more, up next on the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.955]  In case you haven't heard, InfoWars has become the most influential media outlet in America.
[00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:44.720]  We're making freedom go viral, and now we are proud to announce a new weapon in the epic battle against the globalists.
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:55.747]  InfoWars Prime, where you can watch live high-definition feeds of the Alex Jones Show, plus exclusive insider videos from the InfoWars crew and behind-the-scenes
[00:01:56.007 --> 00:01:56.387]  Action!

[00:02:00.668 --> 00:02:04.870]  InfoWars Prime is available right now for your iPhone or Android.
[00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.511]  You will have access to exclusive videos that you can't see anywhere else.
[00:02:09.891 --> 00:02:15.173]  That means live coverage of events and breaking news on location as it happens.
[00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:22.343]  You can also take advantage of amazing deals from the InfoWars store that are only available for InfoWars Prime subscribers.
[00:02:22.503 --> 00:02:26.589]  That's InfoWars Prime at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:14.586]  Info Wars is one of the primary driving factors behind the biggest upset to the New World Order in decades, the election of President Donald Trump.
[00:03:15.006 --> 00:03:21.115]  Now, those globalists want to make it be known that we may have won the battle, but they are still fighting the war.
[00:03:21.496 --> 00:03:21.696]  This is
[00:03:37.105 --> 00:03:37.485]  We're good.
[00:04:00.576 --> 00:04:03.439]  This is their own words in the flyer that they sent to us.
[00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:06.041]  This was due to our support of Donald J. Trump.
[00:04:06.682 --> 00:04:08.444]  They said it was because we are political.
[00:04:08.524 --> 00:04:10.386]  It's political content on our website.
[00:04:10.706 --> 00:04:14.710]  This is an unprecedented attack on the Liberty Movement and free speech.
[00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.673]  Now, this is a platform that InfoWars has utilized over the years.
[00:04:18.734 --> 00:04:25.280]  This is something that we're able to use to promote our high quality products to millions across the web.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.844]  And it's those high quality products, of course, is what we use.
[00:04:29.464 --> 00:04:31.246]  That's our main source of our self funding.
[00:04:31.567 --> 00:04:37.613]  And now they have cut off a supply line that we use to promote that to people out there in the world by the million.
[00:04:37.653 --> 00:04:39.035]  So this is a critical blow.
[00:04:39.055 --> 00:04:46.623]  And so in response, we've launched a massive Defend InfoWars special that's going on at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[00:04:47.043 --> 00:04:53.068]  Tomorrow we're going to be launching the Defense of Liberty 13-hour special broadcast starting at 11 a.m.
[00:04:53.128 --> 00:04:53.488]  Central.
[00:04:53.768 --> 00:05:02.195]  We're going to go all the way till midnight, but this is a time to fight back, to let them know that they might try to dismantle us, but we are not going to take this lying down.
[00:05:02.495 --> 00:05:06.198]  But this is an all-out assault all across the web.
[00:05:06.238 --> 00:05:08.840]  We are seeing any dissenting opinion being taken out.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.664]  Just for instance, Reddit is now blocking pro-Trump forum from the new visitor's homepage.
[00:05:15.684 --> 00:05:25.410]  So if you're a new visitor, a visitor there, you're not even going to see the Donald appear on the discussion sites Popular or All, anything that's very...
[00:05:26.491 --> 00:05:40.401]  Trending anyone who's a visitor to the site is not even gonna see this very popular community and the CEO Steve Huffman says that is they're cracking down on toxic users and poorly behaving Communities he announced that last November.
[00:05:40.461 --> 00:05:54.911]  This is of course just in a line with what Twitter is saying as well is that they're gonna start Pushing tweets down that are low quality whatever that means but what we've seen is that this is an assault on conservatives mainly and people with any dissenting opinion on
[00:05:55.211 --> 00:06:01.595]  People who are not ashamed to speak out against Hillary Clinton or this globalist agenda.
[00:06:01.675 --> 00:06:04.516]  People who are pro-Trump in support of the Trump agenda.
[00:06:04.797 --> 00:06:07.938]  These are people who are being silenced, wiped away altogether.
[00:06:08.238 --> 00:06:09.999]  They're being sent down the memory hole.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.222]  But as Owen Schroer is about to point out, in some cases it's definitely backfiring.
[00:06:15.472 --> 00:06:24.095]  Ladies and gentlemen, the power structure and the internet control grid are in an all-out assault right now against InfoWars.com.
[00:06:24.375 --> 00:06:34.319]  The latest bombshell story, which is on InfoWars.com right now, major ad agency suspends InfoWars over support for Trump discriminatory move based on political content of website.
[00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:44.723]  Major advertising agency AdRoll has suspended its syndication of Infowars product ads across millions of websites and platforms due to our support for Donald Trump.
[00:06:45.223 --> 00:06:49.665]  This is an attempt to cut our revenue, cut our exposure,
[00:06:50.485 --> 00:06:57.132]  And to cut or to delegitimize ourselves as a news source.
[00:06:57.352 --> 00:07:05.680]  So what I'm asking you is to have the Streisand effect take place here like we've seen throughout the course of this Donald Trump movement.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:11.446]  For example, Ivanka Trump's perfume source to number one bestseller on Amazon despite boycotts.
[00:07:11.846 --> 00:07:18.668]  We just had Joy Villa's record sales up by 18 million after wearing a Trump dress to the Grammys.
[00:07:18.968 --> 00:07:20.808]  And let's not forget Trump's victory!
[00:07:21.109 --> 00:07:23.329]  Look at what everyone was saying across the world.
[00:07:23.429 --> 00:07:25.930]  Shock and uncertainty at Trump's victory.
[00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.411]  So help us shock the world.
[00:07:28.691 --> 00:07:36.193]  And in the face of their censorship, in the face of their effort to delegitimize us, help us take InfoWars to the next level.
[00:07:36.413 --> 00:07:38.173]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:07:38.493 --> 00:07:39.774]  That's where you can support us.
[00:07:39.914 --> 00:07:40.894]  That's where you can fund us.
[00:07:41.334 --> 00:07:43.995]  That's how you can help take us to the next level.
[00:07:44.976 --> 00:07:55.380]  I'm here to say, and this is the reason why I came to see you, Alex, is you are one of the very few who are operating under this theory to be an independent American.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.461]  In a big way.
[00:07:57.681 --> 00:07:59.381]  If your calling is media, fine.
[00:07:59.401 --> 00:08:01.262]  If your calling is sports, whatever it is.
[00:08:01.782 --> 00:08:03.443]  But you've got to be the greatest you can be.
[00:08:04.063 --> 00:08:04.404]  Now.
[00:08:04.864 --> 00:08:09.886]  I don't know why they've been successful in pushing everybody into these little ghettos.
[00:08:10.586 --> 00:08:15.310]  Of these Facebooks, and these Tweets, and these Instagrams, these Instas.
[00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.131]  This is ghetto.
[00:08:17.552 --> 00:08:18.312]  This is ghetto.
[00:08:18.332 --> 00:08:19.233]  This is corporate.
[00:08:19.253 --> 00:08:21.815]  They're taking your energy.
[00:08:22.296 --> 00:08:24.598]  They're taking your energy, and you're getting nothing in return.
[00:08:24.978 --> 00:08:25.338]  Nothing.
[00:08:25.358 --> 00:08:26.599]  They're dumbing the language down.
[00:08:26.819 --> 00:08:28.721]  Twitter's designed to reduce the language.
[00:08:28.961 --> 00:08:29.962]  Directly out of 1984, it's Ingsoc.
[00:08:31.503 --> 00:08:35.005]  I had a Supreme Court Justice tell me to my face, it's over for me.
[00:08:35.025 --> 00:08:36.366]  He said, Matt, it's over for you.
[00:08:36.727 --> 00:08:38.928]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[00:08:39.208 --> 00:08:39.769]  You're out of there.
[00:08:39.969 --> 00:08:42.290]  They're going to make it so headlines you can't even use headlines.
[00:08:42.631 --> 00:08:49.435]  To have a Supreme Court Justice say that to my face, that it's over, they've got the votes, which means time is limited.
[00:08:49.795 --> 00:08:51.116]  Time is not forever.
[00:08:51.436 --> 00:08:54.539]  How many more moons and sunrises will you see in your life?
[00:08:55.339 --> 00:08:56.379]  Uh, rise and fall.
[00:08:56.599 --> 00:08:57.560]  There's not that many.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.180]  It's a small amount.
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:05.242]  So for people to be saying with this attitude, oh, I'll get on with my life and my greatness sometime.
[00:09:05.362 --> 00:09:05.542]  No.
[00:09:05.802 --> 00:09:06.642]  No, you can't.
[00:09:06.742 --> 00:09:08.663]  We're being enslaved now, and that's it.
[00:09:08.823 --> 00:09:13.764]  Under the TPP, they admit you can't put a headline to the New York Times.
[00:09:14.024 --> 00:09:16.025]  You're sending massive traffic to them.
[00:09:16.365 --> 00:09:18.806]  They're claiming you're taking their words.
[00:09:19.086 --> 00:09:19.866]  This is insane.
[00:09:19.946 --> 00:09:23.147]  And you had the Justice Stephen Breyer said we need to look at a global law.
[00:09:23.507 --> 00:09:25.729]  Now, remember just recently... Getting him lined up with it!
[00:09:25.989 --> 00:09:28.451]  So, they're getting ready for these decisions to come.
[00:09:28.471 --> 00:09:30.112]  You thought Obamacare was shocking.
[00:09:30.492 --> 00:09:32.294]  You thought some of these other decisions were shocking.
[00:09:32.354 --> 00:09:43.102]  Wait until these copyright laws work their way up and the Supreme Court decides you cannot have a website with news headlines linking across the board.
[00:09:44.315 --> 00:09:55.199]  So while we can definitely have some winds pushing back against this agenda, there are going to be some casualties along the way if you're someone who is not afraid to speak out, specifically on social media.
[00:09:55.579 --> 00:09:59.781]  A teacher was reassigned after praising Trump's action on immigration.
[00:09:59.801 --> 00:10:06.743]  This is an elementary school teacher in Collier County, Florida, reassigned to administrative duties over a Facebook post.
[00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:08.844]  This was during the day without immigrants.
[00:10:09.384 --> 00:10:11.665]  Computer lab instructor Veronica Fleming
[00:10:12.545 --> 00:10:18.631]  The funny part about immigrants staying home is the rest of us who pay for them are here at work like we've always been.
[00:10:18.691 --> 00:10:20.292]  Looks like less mouths to feed today.
[00:10:20.633 --> 00:10:23.615]  And of course this didn't sit well with the parents of the students there.
[00:10:23.636 --> 00:10:26.878]  96% of those are minorities.
[00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:29.060]  So of course again here with these immigrants.
[00:10:29.821 --> 00:10:36.369]  It's not the immigrants, it's the illegal immigrants here that the country is upset with that Donald Trump is talking about deporting.
[00:10:36.589 --> 00:10:48.323]  But we can expect to see more firings, more reassignments, because these are actions that are going to be continually this onslaught to try to push Ram through this agenda and
[00:10:48.823 --> 00:10:54.468]  We talked to you a little bit about these left-wing activist groups, the releasing the anti-Trump training manual for the protests.
[00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:59.993]  Well, these protests are expected to go all out, all out until February 28th.
[00:11:00.334 --> 00:11:05.558]  But of course, the opposition efforts are going to continue until the 2018 midterms.
[00:11:05.959 --> 00:11:10.023]  So this is the Obamatide Group Organization for Action.
[00:11:10.863 --> 00:11:12.044]  Hard left activist group.
[00:11:12.064 --> 00:11:24.192]  They've been promoting their newest training manual aimed at short-circuiting GOP legislators who actually want to repeal Obamacare, want to build a real border wall, and properly vet immigrants entering the United States.
[00:11:24.632 --> 00:11:33.979]  So they're going to show up to these town halls and harass the GOP, any Republicans there, and especially Republicans who think they're in these safe districts.
[00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:36.921]  They're going to be attacking them, calling them in, sending these flyers.
[00:11:37.281 --> 00:11:37.821]  So you know what?
[00:11:38.141 --> 00:11:40.143]  It's up to us who feel like we're safe.
[00:11:40.683 --> 00:11:46.308]  Because Donald Trump won the election and all these Republicans are in the house and we feel like we need to show up as well.
[00:11:46.408 --> 00:11:47.569]  We need to go to these town halls.
[00:11:47.629 --> 00:11:49.891]  We need to call and we need to send in postcards and say, you know what?
[00:11:50.231 --> 00:11:51.192]  I do support this.
[00:11:51.492 --> 00:11:52.933]  I'm thankful that you voted this way.
[00:11:53.513 --> 00:12:01.800]  And don't just let them get hit with all this negative, these negative activists who want to dismantle what people voted en masse for.
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:05.343]  Because you know what's coming in 2018 if we don't push back.
[00:12:05.803 --> 00:12:06.604]  Socialists.
[00:12:06.904 --> 00:12:11.326]  Democratic socialists have made major headway in the US after Trump's win.
[00:12:11.947 --> 00:12:26.194]  Their numbers have actually tripled and they are unlike most mainstream Democrats because the Democratic Socialists of America have a long-term vision of a democratic socialist society in the vein of countries like Sweden and Denmark.
[00:12:26.535 --> 00:12:34.259]  Of course they never want to talk about Venezuela where the average citizen there has lost 20 pounds in the last year because they have no food.
[00:12:35.845 --> 00:12:45.829]  Well the establishment is doing everything to try to undermine the Democratic election of Donald Trump, including going to new levels of changing the Electoral College process.
[00:12:46.109 --> 00:12:46.749]  Take a look at this.
[00:12:47.209 --> 00:12:51.571]  Senate bill passes, Electoral College votes go to winner of popular vote.
[00:12:52.031 --> 00:13:00.854]  Senator Mimi Stewart passed Senate Bill 42, which would allocate New Mexico's Electoral College votes to the winner of the national popular vote.
[00:13:01.415 --> 00:13:01.795]  Wow!
[00:13:02.395 --> 00:13:08.137]  That would totally undermine the state power of New Mexico, and New Mexican citizens should be furious about this.
[00:13:08.638 --> 00:13:15.040]  She says, New Mexico is overlooked by presidential candidates because it is not seen as a battleground state or swing state.
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.982]  That's funny, Trump actually went to New Mexico, Hillary Clinton did not, and Clinton still won that state.
[00:13:20.302 --> 00:13:27.345]  Enacting the legislation would join New Mexico in an agreement with the group of states that make up the National Popular Vote Compact.
[00:13:27.645 --> 00:13:28.045]  We're good to go.
[00:13:51.889 --> 00:14:00.091]  If changed though, 86% of the counties that voted Trump would feel the same way that she's feeling about New Mexico, which ended up going for Clinton anyway.
[00:14:00.471 --> 00:14:08.373]  The legislation now continues to the House of Representatives, where it will be heard in committee before it is considered by the entire chamber.
[00:14:08.453 --> 00:14:14.575]  So this is the left's final desperate attempt to end the republic with the power of the inner city vote.
[00:14:19.912 --> 00:14:25.503]  There's this big hoax like everything else that Trump's trying to limit the press.
[00:14:26.485 --> 00:14:29.170]  There's no legislation, no one calling for it.
[00:14:30.313 --> 00:14:47.343]  Obama signed the NDAA for 2018-2017, it overlaps, saying they were going to put the CIA over the Board of Governors of the FCC and start censoring, quote, fake news, and they're all over the news calling for censoring me and shutting down fake news.
[00:14:47.363 --> 00:14:51.266]  I was talking to this New York Times writer this weekend who wrote a big story about this in the paper today.
[00:14:53.667 --> 00:14:55.068]  He was like, we don't call for censorship.
[00:14:55.088 --> 00:15:02.233]  I go, here's a bunch of your articles I'm looking at where you say Facebook's got to block fake news and I'm listed in here in articles you've written.
[00:15:02.853 --> 00:15:12.900]  And then I read other articles where you are writing about and saying that Trump's trying to censor the press all because he's criticizing you.
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:19.264]  The left always says if they attacked you and you speak back, hey, my free speech, my speech doesn't end just because I offend you.
[00:15:20.024 --> 00:15:22.426]  Me disagreeing with you is coming back at you.
[00:15:22.606 --> 00:15:23.206]  Understand that?
[00:15:23.826 --> 00:15:28.689]  And Jim actually wrote a halfway accurate report for the New York Times.
[00:15:28.849 --> 00:15:30.510]  Roger Stone said he's one of the fairer people he knows.
[00:15:30.791 --> 00:15:32.792]  He did an overall good job getting some of the facts straight.
[00:15:33.152 --> 00:15:35.133]  But he read his other articles, which I read a bunch of them.
[00:15:35.193 --> 00:15:36.674]  I mean, it is just the same thing.
[00:15:36.714 --> 00:15:37.975]  We've got to censor fake news.
[00:15:38.215 --> 00:15:41.057]  And my name is listed in there as an example of that.
[00:15:41.417 --> 00:15:50.783]  So they're the ones calling for censoring us, and then they turn it around and say that Trump's trying to do it, with absolutely zero evidence of it.
[00:15:51.303 --> 00:15:54.585]  It's this upside-down world that's getting pushed, and it's crazy.
[00:15:55.466 --> 00:15:57.507]  Meanwhile, the economy is exploding.
[00:15:58.528 --> 00:16:05.172]  They are weaponizing news and information and dumbing it down to a childlike level.
[00:16:06.647 --> 00:16:11.249]  Because this entire globalist program is about emotions and childlike level control.
[00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:18.232]  And so when they come out and say, nothing's happened in Sweden, Trump's a big liar, they think you're stupid.
[00:16:18.252 --> 00:16:22.734]  There's a giant controversy in Sweden over all the different abusive things that have been happening there.
[00:16:23.234 --> 00:16:33.659]  We have new footage of feminist marches where the entire march stops and observes silence during the call to prayer and to Allah Akbar.
[00:16:35.273 --> 00:16:49.485]  You cannot make this up.
[00:16:49.885 --> 00:16:51.106]  And again, this is a fetish.
[00:16:51.126 --> 00:16:52.007]  This is a cock holding.
[00:16:53.217 --> 00:16:57.659]  They see this as really anti-Christian, anti-freedom, anti-West, anti-open society.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.701]  And so the groups leading these are Islamic.
[00:17:00.941 --> 00:17:02.182]  You can go look it up in Paul's article.
[00:17:02.642 --> 00:17:10.886]  They hand out these plastic hijabs that women then put on by the thousands, and then they put it on the news saying, look how beautiful this is.
[00:17:11.566 --> 00:17:16.649]  And then J-Lo says, how dare Trump want to keep people from coming into the United States.
[00:17:17.009 --> 00:17:18.490]  Yeah, we'll go to Somalia, J-Lo.
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:23.123]  Don't worry, a bunch of Somalis are getting let in right now, unvetted.
[00:17:23.143 --> 00:17:32.312]  They don't let women do the call to prayer under any Islamic system.
[00:17:32.692 --> 00:17:35.394]  So all of it is just completely upside down cuckoo land.
[00:17:35.414 --> 00:17:42.601]  And what do their signs say?
[00:17:42.661 --> 00:17:44.703]  Dismantle white supremacy.
[00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:50.344]  Everything is anti-white, anti-West, even though almost every one of them is white.
[00:17:51.025 --> 00:17:52.646]  This is mass mental illness.
[00:17:53.446 --> 00:17:55.227]  But this is what you pay for at the colleges.
[00:17:55.707 --> 00:17:56.548]  This is what goes on.
[00:17:57.068 --> 00:17:59.910]  And you see the type of women, and I'm not bashing women out to the like women.
[00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:00.410]  Give me a break.
[00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:03.872]  Please don't put me on your level of being obsessed with what, you know, sexuality somebody is.
[00:18:05.384 --> 00:18:12.649]  But these are the type of women that will come up to your good-looking wife, your girlfriend, whatever, in Austin and start hitting on them in front of you.
[00:18:13.329 --> 00:18:14.130]  And they can't even believe it.
[00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:15.130]  They're like, hey, back up.
[00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:16.831]  They're like, whoa, I'm politically correct.
[00:18:17.132 --> 00:18:17.672]  I'm royal.
[00:18:18.652 --> 00:18:20.974]  If a man wants to compete on a women's team, he can.
[00:18:21.034 --> 00:18:23.856]  If a woman wants to take steroids to compete on a women's team, she can.
[00:18:24.316 --> 00:18:26.197]  If a man wants to go in a women's bathroom, he can.
[00:18:26.437 --> 00:18:26.998]  Vice versa.
[00:18:28.046 --> 00:18:38.432]  And Nambla says if they want to pick your five-year-old up out of the backyard, if your five-year-old says they want to go because they're promising a candy or a puppy or video games, that you shouldn't be able to under law.
[00:18:38.872 --> 00:18:41.594]  And the pedophiles argue we won't have to take them to a slave dungeon.
[00:18:41.934 --> 00:18:42.935]  We might let them live.
[00:18:42.995 --> 00:18:48.158]  You see, if you just let us have sex with them, we won't have to kill them and throw them in a shallow grave.
[00:18:49.138 --> 00:18:50.919]  It's your fault we got to kill kids.
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:52.240]  We're liberal.
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.020]  You're not.
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:53.821]  Get used to it.
[00:19:01.172 --> 00:19:03.394]  This is one of the biggest secrets out there.
[00:19:03.694 --> 00:19:15.723]  The missing link of why our ancestors, whether you were in Africa or ancient Albion, which is England today, why our ancestors were so much stronger.
[00:19:15.743 --> 00:19:23.309]  I mean, there are huge archaeological reports, all sorts of anthropology studies, you can look them up for yourself, that show
[00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:32.436]  That humans, just an average farmer of 10,000 years ago in England, was stronger than Olympic athletes today.
[00:19:32.576 --> 00:19:38.740]  In the final equation, everyone knows our modern society has lost its vitality.
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.462]  The sperm counts are down like 90%.
[00:19:42.462 --> 00:19:43.703]  People are falling apart.
[00:19:43.723 --> 00:19:44.724]  They're totally depressed.
[00:19:44.744 --> 00:19:45.284]  They're not happy.
[00:19:45.865 --> 00:19:46.845]  What is going on?
[00:19:48.126 --> 00:19:51.969]  Every ancient culture was obsessed
[00:19:53.206 --> 00:19:55.727]  With what I'm about to reveal to you.
[00:19:56.167 --> 00:19:57.868]  Today we call it bone broth.
[00:19:58.068 --> 00:20:05.072]  And for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it became a loss to our modern diets of processed junk.
[00:20:05.312 --> 00:20:13.616]  That's why I'm so excited to announce the product that is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of InfoWars Life products.
[00:20:15.035 --> 00:20:21.547]  Caveman, we lost our vitality because we just ignored the ancient traditions.
[00:20:21.928 --> 00:20:25.354]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[00:20:25.394 --> 00:20:26.456]  You used the skin.
[00:20:27.062 --> 00:20:34.207]  To cover yourself up for shelter, you use the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you use the bones for strength.
[00:20:34.727 --> 00:20:48.577]  We are now introducing Caveman by Infowarslife.com, the ultimate in true paleo nutrition with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single great tasting formula.
[00:20:48.697 --> 00:20:50.158]  The bone is so amazing.
[00:20:50.578 --> 00:20:56.162]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body.
[00:20:57.298 --> 00:21:00.200]  This is the engine of the life essence.
[00:21:00.741 --> 00:21:06.185]  I've made a lot of important points here, but this is the one you need to research for yourself because it's so key.
[00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:15.952]  High quality bone broth helps support healthy muscles and connective tissue, while the active compounds in turmeric do battle on the cellular level and help fight free radicals.
[00:21:16.212 --> 00:21:20.756]  And collagen is essential to aid healthy tendons, ligaments, and muscle tissue.
[00:21:20.996 --> 00:21:22.797]  This is a absolute win-win.
[00:21:22.857 --> 00:21:25.618]  You get an amazing product produced right here in America.
[00:21:25.918 --> 00:21:32.020]  You support InfoWars and all we're doing to promote freedom and the restoration of our Republic and promotion of freedom worldwide.
[00:21:33.321 --> 00:21:42.044]  The journey towards better health and giving our bodies these amazing compounds that God created starts at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:21:42.224 --> 00:21:46.606]  Three years in the making, incredible research and the very best ingredients.
[00:21:47.126 --> 00:21:49.727]  I'm Alex Jones and I may not be a caveman,
[00:21:50.569 --> 00:21:53.739]  Compared to these trendies out there in the street, I'm as close as it gets.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.571]  Join me at InformersLife.com and get your caveman formula today.
[00:22:01.018 --> 00:22:04.381]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:06.743]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:22:06.923 --> 00:22:15.310]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.913]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:22:19.073 --> 00:22:28.080]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:36.962]  Supermale vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:22:37.162 --> 00:22:39.083]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:22:39.403 --> 00:22:46.985]  Supermale vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:53.528]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:22:53.828 --> 00:23:00.752]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Mel Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:23:05.273 --> 00:23:12.462]  Never forget Saul Alinsky's first rule for radicals, or one of his key rules for radicals, and that is, ridicule is the most powerful weapon.
[00:23:12.482 --> 00:23:17.929]  And not forgetting that, we have Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers, and others on late night still ridiculing Donald Trump.
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:19.000]  We're good
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:41.144]  Had the hashtag, this is Stephen Colbert, neverfjordget.
[00:23:41.544 --> 00:23:51.855]  And they're mocking him, talking about showcasing Swedish products like Swedish fish candy, IKEA, and ABBA, with the tribute neverfjordget.
[00:23:52.155 --> 00:23:59.522]  And then we had Seth Meyers saying, it turns out what Trump was referring to was not a terror attack in Sweden, but a segment that he saw the night before on Fox News about refugees in Sweden.
[00:23:59.763 --> 00:24:00.563]  So far, so true.
[00:24:01.444 --> 00:24:05.569]  So Trump literally saw something on Fox News and confused it for reality.
[00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.550]  There you go.
[00:24:07.131 --> 00:24:09.914]  Now the police say that their comments were taken out of context.
[00:24:09.955 --> 00:24:18.525]  So what we see here from the Washington Post is not only a defense of the immigrants, but also an attack on Donald Trump.
[00:24:18.585 --> 00:24:20.667]  And of course, the Washington Post, Jeff Bezos,
[00:24:21.798 --> 00:24:22.159]  I don't know.
[00:24:42.461 --> 00:24:47.784]  And B, we're going to roll back the narrative of these police who said that there's violence in the cities.
[00:24:47.804 --> 00:24:52.306]  We're going to talk about both of those things and show you where this has been headed for several months.
[00:24:52.347 --> 00:24:54.808]  We've been talking about what's going on actually for the last year.
[00:24:54.848 --> 00:24:57.269]  We've been talking about the rising crime rates and other issues.
[00:24:57.289 --> 00:25:00.611]  But let's take a look first at how the Washington Post spends this.
[00:25:01.311 --> 00:25:06.975]  They say the riot comes two days after President Trump implied that immigrants had perpetrated a recent spate of violence.
[00:25:07.375 --> 00:25:10.757]  Just two days after President Trump provoked
[00:25:11.647 --> 00:25:13.349]  Widespread consternation.
[00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:18.456]  So they don't say they actually caused the riots, but they imply strongly that he did.
[00:25:18.876 --> 00:25:21.259]  They say he provoked widespread consternation.
[00:25:21.579 --> 00:25:27.246]  So riots broke out in a predominantly immigrant neighborhood in the northern suburbs of Sweden's capital, Stockholm.
[00:25:27.887 --> 00:25:33.812]  The neighborhood was the scene of riots in 2010 and 2013, but of course, there's no problem with immigrants.
[00:25:33.893 --> 00:25:48.686]  No, the problem is with Donald Trump, and they say it went on for four hours, the crowd burned about a half dozen cars, vandalized several shop fronts, threw rocks at police, they beat up a photographer for the local newspaper, stole his camera, but you know, these people are not bad.
[00:25:48.886 --> 00:25:50.147]  They're just misunderstood, right?
[00:25:50.908 --> 00:25:54.089]  They say Sweden took the greatest number of immigrants per capita.
[00:25:54.429 --> 00:25:56.550]  They say integration has been a success story there.
[00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:58.051]  This is the way Washington Post is spinning it.
[00:25:58.691 --> 00:26:00.312]  Say, for instance, like Monday night.
[00:26:00.352 --> 00:26:03.413]  So they can't deny that these riots happened because they just happened.
[00:26:03.433 --> 00:26:07.755]  So immediately as it comes out, they try to spin it back and say, no, this is an outlier.
[00:26:07.835 --> 00:26:08.815]  This is an aberration.
[00:26:08.875 --> 00:26:11.096]  This really isn't characteristic of what's going on.
[00:26:11.116 --> 00:26:12.337]  We're going to show you that it truly is.
[00:26:13.337 --> 00:26:16.758]  They say that these things have happened in highly segregated neighborhoods.
[00:26:16.798 --> 00:26:17.018]  Yes.
[00:26:17.239 --> 00:26:18.139]  Why are they segregated?
[00:26:18.922 --> 00:26:25.244]  Well, they bring Muslims in because they know that Muslims are going to remain segregated culturally, religiously, and legally.
[00:26:25.304 --> 00:26:26.565]  They try to segregate themselves.
[00:26:26.605 --> 00:26:30.927]  They self-ghettoize in these areas, and that creates a problem for the next generation.
[00:26:30.947 --> 00:26:32.447]  We're going to get to that in a moment here as well.
[00:26:32.867 --> 00:26:41.451]  But of course, the Tucker Carlson show that Trump referred to on Saturday, that Friday night show, featured a filmmaker, Ami Horowitz.
[00:26:41.891 --> 00:26:44.452]  Now, he had interviewed a couple of Swedish police officers.
[00:26:44.492 --> 00:26:47.233]  This is the point now where first they blame Trump,
[00:26:47.873 --> 00:26:50.296]  Say he provoked widespread consternation, then we had riots.
[00:26:50.956 --> 00:26:54.420]  Then they say, no, it's really been a success, this really isn't a generalized problem.
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:58.444]  And when this filmmaker talked to these Swedish police officers, they've now recanted.
[00:26:58.704 --> 00:26:59.004]  Oh, really?
[00:26:59.565 --> 00:27:05.351]  They go on to say the two Swedish police officers whose interview provided the basis for this report spoke out on Monday.
[00:27:06.448 --> 00:27:08.910]  And they claim that their testimony had been taken out of context.
[00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:17.817]  One of them, Anders Gorazon, said the interview was about areas with high crime rates and that there wasn't any focus on migration or on immigration.
[00:27:17.897 --> 00:27:24.382]  No, it's just coincidental that these areas with high crime rates happen to be filled with migrants, as we pointed out yesterday.
[00:27:25.305 --> 00:27:25.885]  We're good to go.
[00:27:42.759 --> 00:27:46.322]  He said he was pretty sure that he told the officers what the segment was going to be about.
[00:27:46.362 --> 00:27:50.606]  He implied the officer's disavowal was made under pressure from his superiors.
[00:27:51.147 --> 00:27:52.028]  You think that's possible?
[00:27:52.428 --> 00:27:54.450]  Well, it's not only possible, but we have seen that.
[00:27:54.490 --> 00:28:04.720]  And then they go on to say the Washington Post interviewed multiple criminologists in Sweden that said, oh, the idea that immigrants are responsible for a large proportion of crime there was highly exaggerated.
[00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:07.482]  And there's no such thing as no-go zones.
[00:28:08.343 --> 00:28:16.047]  Remember that it was just February the 6th when we reprinted an article from Speise, a foreign Swedish newspaper.
[00:28:16.447 --> 00:28:19.769]  In it we had a story from Peter Springer.
[00:28:19.929 --> 00:28:23.871]  Now he is not the person that the Washington Post said recanted it.
[00:28:24.151 --> 00:28:30.214]  So we've got two articles at Infowars, one February the 6th, one from February the 7th this year, just a couple of weeks ago.
[00:28:31.209 --> 00:28:36.172]  Two other police officers besides these two who just recanted, I believe, under pressure.
[00:28:36.573 --> 00:28:40.335]  But these other two guys were the ones that we covered, and they did not recant.
[00:28:41.076 --> 00:28:43.137]  So here's the first one, Peter Springara.
[00:28:43.738 --> 00:28:49.902]  He's a police investigator, former deputy head of the Division for Serious Crimes for the police in Oroboro.
[00:28:50.482 --> 00:28:55.626]  And he reported to the police after he had a post on Facebook where he plainly spoke about what he saw.
[00:28:56.226 --> 00:28:56.886]  This is what he wrote.
[00:28:57.206 --> 00:28:58.227]  I am so effing tired.
[00:28:58.647 --> 00:29:01.768]  What I will write here below is not politically correct, but I don't care.
[00:29:01.848 --> 00:29:07.010]  What I will tell you, taxpayers, is forbidden to tell you by us state employees.
[00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:11.712]  It results in the loss of career, the loss of individual salaries, even if it's true.
[00:29:12.552 --> 00:29:13.533]  I don't care about all this.
[00:29:13.733 --> 00:29:16.354]  I will soon retire anyway after 47 years in this business.
[00:29:16.555 --> 00:29:25.100]  I will now, and every week going forward, in detail, account for what I, as an investigator of Serious Crimes Unit of the Police in Oroboro, work with.
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:32.064]  It will not harmonize with the BRA's statistics, its perception, or other leftist criminologist's perception in the public debate.
[00:29:32.425 --> 00:29:33.866]  He said our pensioners are on their knees.
[00:29:34.366 --> 00:29:35.667]  The school is one of chaos.
[00:29:36.601 --> 00:29:40.662]  The healthcare is an inferno, police have been completely destroyed, etc, etc.
[00:29:40.802 --> 00:29:55.427]  Everyone knows why but no one dares or wants to talk about the reason because Sweden has always lived on the myth of the magnificent ultimate society that has unlimited resources to be in the forefront when it comes to being the only politically correct option in a dysfunctional world.
[00:29:55.887 --> 00:29:56.747]  So he goes, here we go.
[00:29:57.107 --> 00:30:03.469]  In the last week I've handled Money Through Friday, rape, rape, aggravated rape, assault, rape, extortion, blackmail, abuse of judicial procedure.
[00:30:03.929 --> 00:30:08.192]  Threats, violence against the police, threat to the police, drug trafficking, so forth and so on.
[00:30:08.212 --> 00:30:13.896]  He goes, and these perpetrators are people with the name of Ali Muhammad.
[00:30:14.337 --> 00:30:16.678]  Muhammad, Muhammad Ali, again and again and again.
[00:30:16.819 --> 00:30:19.080]  And then Christopher, oh wait, that's a Swedish name.
[00:30:19.761 --> 00:30:20.541]  That was a drug offense.
[00:30:20.561 --> 00:30:23.163]  Then Muhammad Mahmood Ali, again and again.
[00:30:23.263 --> 00:30:24.404]  And so he goes on with this.
[00:30:24.704 --> 00:30:28.507]  Then after that, we had a second police officer come out and underscore that.
[00:30:28.587 --> 00:30:30.549]  We had the article on February the 7th.
[00:30:31.803 --> 00:30:43.128]  Remember back in September of 2016, we had the video, there is no turning back, a Swedish TV ad that said that Swedes must accept multiculturalism.
[00:30:43.428 --> 00:30:57.454]  You look at that picture there, the woman in the hijab, and of course that video has now been flushed from the internet, just as they would like to flush Infowars and the rest of us who report on this, they took that back and this is the text from their video, they said there is no turning back, Sweden will never be what it was before,
[00:30:57.834 --> 00:31:00.096]  It is an understanding of what the world actually looks like.
[00:31:00.216 --> 00:31:03.899]  Sweden is needed as a place for people who need refuge and so forth and so on.
[00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:13.348]  It's time to realize that new Swedes will take up room with cultures, languages, customs, and it's time that we see this as a positive force.
[00:31:14.008 --> 00:31:20.074]  You have to understand, this is the globalist program that people in Germany, some have called the Great People Replacement.
[00:31:20.394 --> 00:31:32.305]  Going back to what Bertolt Brecht said, when he looked across at East Germany, of course he was a communist, he had a lot of faith in communism, and you had people in East Germany trying to get a higher minimum wage.
[00:31:32.885 --> 00:31:33.225]  Well, they do.
[00:31:33.265 --> 00:31:41.469]  They call the police out, beat them down, and they said, well, I guess it's easier to replace the people than it is to replace the people who govern us.
[00:31:41.569 --> 00:31:43.190]  And that is what is happening in Europe.
[00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:44.851]  It is a great people replacement.
[00:31:44.931 --> 00:31:47.672]  They want to replace the people, their culture, etc.
[00:31:48.052 --> 00:31:56.176]  And then on the day that this came out, this last Friday, the day that Tucker Carlson interviewed the filmmaker, we had a story from Steven Crowder.
[00:31:56.576 --> 00:32:01.419]  Frightened Swedes wear bulletproof vests because of terrorism, but Parliament cracks down.
[00:32:02.165 --> 00:32:07.788]  He says it's apparent now that citizens have started turning to bulletproof vests for self-defense, but parliament members are having none of it.
[00:32:07.828 --> 00:32:11.510]  Just a few weeks ago, bulletproof vests saved the life of an 18-year-old in Malmo.
[00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:12.991]  That's the city I was talking about earlier.
[00:32:13.491 --> 00:32:15.312]  And more people buy and wear bulletproof vests.
[00:32:15.372 --> 00:32:21.736]  So, the chairman of the Swedish Parliamentary Defense Committee demanded that individuals be prohibited from wearing a bulletproof vest.
[00:32:22.356 --> 00:32:22.616]  Why?
[00:32:22.877 --> 00:32:25.058]  Because even something that can't hurt somebody else
[00:32:26.138 --> 00:32:27.779]  They don't want you to be able to defend yourself.
[00:32:27.819 --> 00:32:30.661]  And as he pointed out, it's the same argument that we have against gun control.
[00:32:31.162 --> 00:32:33.443]  If you want to try to defend yourself, they take that down.
[00:32:33.563 --> 00:32:38.367]  Today we have an article, we're about out of time, ISIS boasting that Muslims born in the U.S.
[00:32:38.387 --> 00:32:39.608]  will become an army of conquest.
[00:32:39.648 --> 00:32:40.529]  Of course they will!
[00:32:41.249 --> 00:32:46.294]  As I said earlier, they self-ghettoize and that's the issue for the second generation.
[00:32:46.715 --> 00:32:56.925]  What we're going to find is that there's going to be a much higher percentage of radicals in the second generation than there were in the people who originally came here because the resentment of the ghetto that they were raised in.
[00:33:06.508 --> 00:33:16.037]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:33:17.022 --> 00:33:18.903]  That's why I get questions all the time over the years.
[00:33:18.923 --> 00:33:23.025]  Why don't you sell body armor at infowarestore.com?
[00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:25.726]  Or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:26.746]  And it's simple.
[00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:32.429]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:33.930]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.791]  There's quality versus price.
[00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:38.732]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:33:39.332 --> 00:33:44.775]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor,
[00:33:45.595 --> 00:33:52.304]  has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people.
[00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:55.913]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:33:56.653 --> 00:34:03.715]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:34:04.415 --> 00:34:07.216]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:09.657]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:13.678]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:14.919]  Well, believe me,
[00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:18.677]  This is Disruptive to Tyrants Worldwide.
[00:34:19.297 --> 00:34:30.319]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:31.959]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:34.099]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.761]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:34:42.541 --> 00:34:44.882]  We've, uh, went out and did some testing.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:47.663]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:34:47.683 --> 00:34:54.166]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, um, could be so strong.
[00:34:54.386 --> 00:35:07.672]  So what we did is we went out, we used, um, different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:35:08.052 --> 00:35:08.872]  Born in Texas.
[00:35:09.213 --> 00:35:10.173]  Made in America.
[00:35:10.373 --> 00:35:13.015]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:13.875]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:13.935 --> 00:35:14.875]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:35:15.236 --> 00:35:16.576]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:17.237]  It's waterproof.
[00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:17.737]  You can wear it.
[00:35:17.777 --> 00:35:18.337]  It's comfortable.
[00:35:18.397 --> 00:35:19.218]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:35:19.238 --> 00:35:21.539]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:29.623]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:35:30.323 --> 00:35:33.986]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:40.712]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:35:40.732 --> 00:35:42.094]  What did they really say about it?
[00:35:42.194 --> 00:35:43.214]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:46.177]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:54.865]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're weighing, they're wearing these big heavy bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:35:55.425 --> 00:36:00.429]  So, they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:07.954]  And 90, I mean, you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in a commission of crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:36:07.974 --> 00:36:09.636]  This stops that, unless it's a slug.
[00:36:09.656 --> 00:36:10.796]  I mean, that's amazing.
[00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:14.059]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[00:36:14.319 --> 00:36:20.183]  And soon, and we'll have it, if it's available to civilians, they're not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[00:36:20.504 --> 00:36:24.486]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:28.689]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:36:28.709 --> 00:36:29.469]  People didn't believe it.
[00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:30.810]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.611]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:36:33.932 --> 00:36:36.033]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:36:36.974 --> 00:36:41.156]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:48.356]  Again, fund the Info War, get the game-changing Nanotech Tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:36:48.836 --> 00:36:50.837]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:50.857 --> 00:36:50.837]  $200.
[00:36:51.458 --> 00:36:54.399]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:36:54.479 --> 00:36:55.180]  It's amazing.
[00:37:09.231 --> 00:37:20.946]  Kurt Weldon is joining us, former congressman, former vice head of Homeland Security and the Armed Services Committee, an expert on Russian infiltration with the Clintons and technology transfers.
[00:37:21.466 --> 00:37:24.310]  There's a big article on InfoWars.com that just broke.
[00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:25.712]  Dr. Jerome Corsi is with him right now.
[00:37:26.132 --> 00:37:31.836]  The congressman has to go in a minute to go to a UN meeting, I was told, but I'm glad we're doing this today now.
[00:37:32.516 --> 00:37:36.338]  Russian bank docs show how Putin laundered money to Hillary in Podesta.
[00:37:36.759 --> 00:37:37.939]  Now we know why Clinton and co.
[00:37:37.979 --> 00:37:40.761]  were so desperate to frame Trump with ties to Putin.
[00:37:40.801 --> 00:37:43.423]  So it's good to have the former congressman on with us.
[00:37:43.743 --> 00:37:48.386]  I know he's going to be the source of some articles in the next few days, concurring with this and the background.
[00:37:48.626 --> 00:37:51.748]  So thank you, Dr. Corsi, and former congressman, thank you.
[00:37:52.879 --> 00:37:53.900]  We're delighted to be with you.
[00:37:54.220 --> 00:38:12.090]  And I think it's really important to know that Congressman Weldon did a lot of the groundbreaking research in the 90s showing the technology transfer, the payments that the Clintons got for transferring technology to China.
[00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:18.153]  And he is very familiar with the subject of this article, Veklesberg and how the Russians operated.
[00:38:18.774 --> 00:38:20.855]  Here's Congressman Weldon to talk about it.
[00:38:21.355 --> 00:38:25.062]  Well, thank you, and it's an honor to be with you and be on your show.
[00:38:26.186 --> 00:38:29.927]  I can give you a few moments of history that I'm sure you're aware of.
[00:38:30.767 --> 00:38:34.528]  It's amazing that we talk about Russian influence in the presidential election.
[00:38:35.188 --> 00:38:40.309]  It was Bill Clinton's advisors who were sent to Moscow in 95 and 96.
[00:38:40.369 --> 00:38:47.010]  They actually stayed in the presidential hotel in Moscow and they ran Yeltsin's re-election campaign.
[00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:55.572]  So the Russians were aware that US strategic advisors were actually running the presidential campaign of a president whose popularity
[00:38:56.212 --> 00:38:56.312]  Yes.
[00:39:12.751 --> 00:39:12.951]  Yes.
[00:39:33.729 --> 00:39:33.969]  Yes.
[00:39:34.029 --> 00:39:39.912]  And I would remind people that it was two of the largest fundraising operatives in the U.S.
[00:39:39.972 --> 00:39:47.355]  at that time, Riyadi and Wang, got access to the Clinton White House 49 and 17 times in one year.
[00:39:47.895 --> 00:39:48.716]  Neither was a U.S.
[00:39:48.756 --> 00:39:54.258]  citizen, and they were the prime fundraisers for the Clinton, Gore, and Democratic campaign committees.
[00:39:54.978 --> 00:40:00.541]  And finally, I would add that one needs to look at the CEO of LaRal Corporation, Bernie Schwartz.
[00:40:01.101 --> 00:40:16.768]  When LaRouche Corporation was caught transferring very sensitive technology to China, and Sandy Berger, Clinton's National Security Advisor, arranged and got Bill Clinton to sign a retroactive presidential waiver, which means the technology had already been transferred.
[00:40:17.208 --> 00:40:21.450]  Technology that our commission voted 9-0 caused serious harm to us.
[00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:27.916]  Bernie Schwartz was the beneficiary of that retroactive presidential waiver, so he couldn't be indicted.
[00:40:28.457 --> 00:40:34.403]  And that was the same year he became... Former Congressman Matt Weldon, former heads of these committees, they've got to go in about 6-7 minutes.
[00:40:34.423 --> 00:40:35.284]  We're going to break shortly.
[00:40:35.304 --> 00:40:42.532]  I'm going to come right back so we can finish up and talk about how this fits in today with the new information that the Clintons have been on the Russian and Chinese payroll.
[00:40:42.592 --> 00:40:44.334]  I mean, I was on there, then I remember it was all the news.
[00:40:44.654 --> 00:40:45.414]  Your committee covered it.
[00:40:45.434 --> 00:40:46.195]  It was documented.
[00:40:46.535 --> 00:40:49.296]  So it's just crazy these so-called ties to Trump.
[00:40:49.316 --> 00:40:52.637]  So I'd like to get your take on that and have you back up for a full 30 minutes soon.
[00:40:52.677 --> 00:40:53.417]  We'll be right back.
[00:40:53.437 --> 00:40:53.857]  Stay with us.
[00:41:03.641 --> 00:41:28.211]  I remember the hearings when they just exposed the Communist Chinese, the Russians, the Clintons all got waivers though from themselves to do it, but then after they're at the State Department continuing, and even the New York Times admits 30-something million for all this uranium concessions, now we've got new documents about money going to Podesta and Hillary for more technology transfers under Obama, and then they've got the nerve to point the finger and say the former National Security Advisor
[00:41:28.951 --> 00:41:31.013]  Talk to the Russians about sanctions?
[00:41:31.113 --> 00:41:31.453]  Okay.
[00:41:31.834 --> 00:41:32.915]  I mean, that's what they do.
[00:41:32.995 --> 00:41:37.299]  So, as an expert on this, former Congressman Weldon, just in three or four minutes, I know you got to go.
[00:41:37.339 --> 00:41:38.400]  Your crew's trying to drag you out.
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.021]  What's the nutshell?
[00:41:40.081 --> 00:41:41.302]  What's the takeaway from this?
[00:41:41.362 --> 00:41:43.104]  And where is all this going?
[00:41:44.329 --> 00:41:52.976]  Well, Dr. Corsi has shown me some documents here that are startling, involving what look to be illegal payments to the Clintons.
[00:41:53.857 --> 00:42:00.022]  I'm going to talk to my associates in Russia, who work with Russia, and see what else I can find out.
[00:42:00.142 --> 00:42:08.249]  I can tell you this hatchet job that's taking place against General Flynn, who's an outstanding American, and our President, is wrong.
[00:42:08.889 --> 00:42:10.511]  I've remained silent for 10 years.
[00:42:11.311 --> 00:42:12.952]  I have 480 cases of files.
[00:42:13.513 --> 00:42:15.495]  I've done 100 hours of an oral history.
[00:42:15.515 --> 00:42:20.378]  And I'm going to start to come out now with irrefutable facts about what I saw occur.
[00:42:20.959 --> 00:42:24.822]  What I saw with the Clintons in lining the pockets of themselves and their friends.
[00:42:25.302 --> 00:42:28.765]  While they left our foreign policy basically hanging in the air.
[00:42:29.206 --> 00:42:30.567]  When they went and murdered Gaddafi.
[00:42:31.027 --> 00:42:33.909]  Causing much of the problem we have with immigrants around the world.
[00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:36.892]  When we played games in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[00:42:37.612 --> 00:42:48.420]  The true story of the 9-11, and I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I am dedicated to the true story that protected and unfortunately lost 343 firefighters in New York.
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:48.961]  Sure, the 28 pages.
[00:42:52.103 --> 00:42:56.826]  All of which you're talking about and all of which needs to be brought forth to the American people.
[00:42:57.227 --> 00:43:07.854]  If the Clintons are going to try to misinform and malign the integrity of our new president and people like you trying to get out the truth, then it's time for America to step up to the plate.
[00:43:08.254 --> 00:43:09.415]  I've never met Donald Trump.
[00:43:10.035 --> 00:43:13.456]  I voted for him, and I wrote op-eds for him in the primary and the general.
[00:43:13.896 --> 00:43:15.836]  But I'm not going to sit back any longer.
[00:43:16.496 --> 00:43:18.777]  Members of Congress know the facts that I have.
[00:43:19.217 --> 00:43:27.038]  They know that I've been trying to restart a trilateral dialogue with the Duma and the Federation Council, the Rada in Ukraine, and the U.S.
[00:43:27.078 --> 00:43:27.498]  Congress.
[00:43:27.778 --> 00:43:33.779]  But I'm not going to sit back and let these morons try to rewrite history when I saw what happened.
[00:43:33.819 --> 00:43:37.920]  I was on the Cox Commission when we voted 9-0 that our security was harmed.
[00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:45.829]  I have the charts that I'll make available to your show to show the PLA money going to front companies that benefited the Clinton-Gore campaign.
[00:43:46.049 --> 00:43:58.563]  I'll show you the charts with the Chinese nationals who were admitted to the White House 17 and 49 times in the same election year that Clinton was running for re-election while they're raising money for the Clinton-Gore campaign.
[00:43:58.983 --> 00:44:05.266]  You can check online and find the retroactive waiver that was given to Bernie Schwartz, the CEO of Laurel Corporation.
[00:44:05.286 --> 00:44:05.486]  Sure, sure.
[00:44:05.506 --> 00:44:14.711]  What you're saying is, bottom line, you were heading up these committees, you saw it all, you know it really happened, and then they're claiming everything that they've done, Trump's done, so you're going to break your silence.
[00:44:14.771 --> 00:44:24.936]  Obviously, you've had high-level, highest-level security clearances to know all this, and now you're saying you and others, not to put words in your mouth, are getting ready, if they want to play games, to bring the truth out.
[00:44:25.623 --> 00:44:26.703]  We're not going to play games.
[00:44:27.383 --> 00:44:30.284]  I've been sitting back for 10 years, and the Clintons know this.
[00:44:30.864 --> 00:44:32.465]  I was his number one target in 2006.
[00:44:33.285 --> 00:44:36.326]  I've got 480 cases of files.
[00:44:36.786 --> 00:44:38.846]  I've got 100 hours of world history.
[00:44:39.327 --> 00:44:45.568]  I've got 40 hours of other takes done by former officials, former agency people, former DOD people.
[00:44:45.988 --> 00:44:49.129]  And if they want to play hardball, then it's time to play hardball.
[00:44:49.409 --> 00:44:51.670]  They screwed with my family 10 years ago.
[00:44:53.251 --> 00:44:56.757]  Unlike anything that Hillary Clinton experienced, my family experienced.
[00:44:57.078 --> 00:44:59.482]  It's time now that I'm going to say, it's over.
[00:45:00.063 --> 00:45:01.807]  Clintons, it's time you move on.
[00:45:02.027 --> 00:45:05.393]  And if you don't want to do it voluntarily, then I'm going to be your worst nightmare.
[00:45:06.601 --> 00:45:20.968]  And the key here, Alex, is I think we've got the connections between what was going on in the 90s with the Clintons and the documents we're getting today, these Russian bank documents, which are fully validated in the Russian newspapers and also in U.S.
[00:45:21.028 --> 00:45:21.789]  news reports.
[00:45:22.089 --> 00:45:29.152]  Well, I understand, Dr. Corzi, are you going with the former vice chair or are you going to stay and talk more?
[00:45:29.172 --> 00:45:29.873]  Because I know he's got to go.
[00:45:30.547 --> 00:45:31.508]  I'll stay and talk more.
[00:45:31.528 --> 00:45:31.868]  I'm here.
[00:45:31.888 --> 00:45:33.270]  Okay, well take a minute to say bye.
[00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:35.912]  Sir, Congressman, I know you went through a lot.
[00:45:36.133 --> 00:45:36.833]  Thank you for everything.
[00:45:37.174 --> 00:45:38.395]  Just 60 seconds, final comment.
[00:45:39.175 --> 00:45:39.515]  Thank you.
[00:45:39.615 --> 00:45:40.436]  You've got to find a comment.
[00:45:40.476 --> 00:45:41.296]  Okay, I appreciate it.
[00:45:41.356 --> 00:45:45.898]  Let me say, Alex, during my 20 years in Congress, everything I did was bipartisan.
[00:45:46.078 --> 00:45:49.239]  Some of my best friends in Congress were, and still are, Democrats.
[00:45:49.259 --> 00:45:49.859]  You're known for that.
[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:51.160]  Trips overseas.
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:54.021]  This is not about Republican versus Democrat.
[00:45:54.341 --> 00:46:03.305]  This is about America being taken back from the thieves who became wealthy on the backs of the taxpayers of this country and on the backs of innocent people around the world.
[00:46:03.585 --> 00:46:05.026]  That's the story that's got to be told.
[00:46:05.646 --> 00:46:05.967]  Yes, sir.
[00:46:05.987 --> 00:46:07.389]  Well, please, let's get you on it.
[00:46:07.409 --> 00:46:09.032]  I'll send a crew up there with the press conference.
[00:46:09.072 --> 00:46:13.080]  I know this is big to have you, one of the former heads of these committees, with this information.
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:14.242]  This is very important.
[00:46:14.262 --> 00:46:14.602]  Thank you, sir.
[00:46:19.511 --> 00:46:21.252]  It's the illusion of choice.
[00:46:21.432 --> 00:46:21.972]  Think about it.
[00:46:22.192 --> 00:46:27.954]  The mainstream media is owned by only a handful of megacorporations with vested interests.
[00:46:28.234 --> 00:46:33.835]  But on the other hand, the internet is an interconnected network of billions of sources.
[00:46:34.176 --> 00:46:38.437]  So you can research information for yourself from multiple sources.
[00:46:38.957 --> 00:46:45.943]  Or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media, never questioning what you are being told.
[00:46:46.223 --> 00:46:48.985]  This gives you a false sense of reality.
[00:46:49.185 --> 00:46:51.667]  I mean, do you actually know what you think you know?
[00:46:51.967 --> 00:46:56.411]  Or have you been programmed to accept someone else's version of events?
[00:46:56.851 --> 00:46:57.452]  Think about it.
[00:46:57.652 --> 00:47:02.876]  This is Darren McBreen, and I want you to break the matrix at InfoWars.com.
[00:47:02.996 --> 00:47:07.740]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:10.005]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.405 --> 00:47:15.406]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.746 --> 00:47:21.188]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.414]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.434 --> 00:48:49.475]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.815 --> 00:48:50.496]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.556 --> 00:48:51.156]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.517 --> 00:48:59.064]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.084 --> 00:48:59.965]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.985 --> 00:49:00.025]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:06.872 --> 00:49:09.933]  Folks, InfoWars is under unprecedented attack.
[00:49:10.513 --> 00:49:24.779]  Now the election of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States of America was a major blow to the globalists and now they are making it very clear that InfoWars has played a major role on that and so they have actually gone out of their way
[00:49:25.279 --> 00:49:27.381]  Full bore to take us out.
[00:49:27.441 --> 00:49:34.386]  Now, you may have heard, but today InfoWars has been banned from one of the largest advertising platforms in the world.
[00:49:34.646 --> 00:49:42.511]  This is going to be an unprecedented blow to our bottom line, and of course, a major attack on the Liberty Movement and free speech.
[00:49:43.012 --> 00:49:50.397]  Now, Owen, talk to us a little bit about this unprecedented attack and how, you know, the role that this ad agency plays.
[00:49:50.697 --> 00:49:51.678]  Well, you know, it's actually funny.
[00:49:51.918 --> 00:49:53.739]  I hadn't thought of this till I just heard you talk.
[00:49:54.199 --> 00:50:05.046]  Remember it was Rand Paul on TV a few days ago defending Donald Trump against attacks against him, saying that he was trying to stymie free speech, claiming that Donald Trump was a threat to free speech.
[00:50:05.467 --> 00:50:09.469]  And Rand Paul defended Donald Trump and said, well, now wait a second, I haven't seen any legislation.
[00:50:09.489 --> 00:50:11.551]  I haven't seen any laws passed or anything on the books.
[00:50:12.031 --> 00:50:12.352]  I don't know.
[00:50:24.833 --> 00:50:31.597]  Facebook and AdRoll, which is the company censoring InfoWars now, and Twitter and all these corporations, you know what?
[00:50:31.937 --> 00:50:36.499]  They're private entities and they actually can decide to do this if they want.
[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:38.961]  But the issue here is why?
[00:50:39.481 --> 00:50:41.522]  Why are they censoring InfoWars?
[00:50:41.682 --> 00:50:44.304]  It's a total political move, folks.
[00:50:44.724 --> 00:50:47.145]  It's because of the content that we push.
[00:50:47.685 --> 00:50:50.267]  They even cited for the political content.
[00:50:50.347 --> 00:50:52.608]  That's why they're discriminating against us.
[00:50:54.349 --> 00:50:55.532]  So why do they discriminate?
[00:50:55.572 --> 00:50:56.114]  Why is it us?
[00:50:56.194 --> 00:50:57.076]  It's because of our views.
[00:50:57.196 --> 00:50:58.680]  It's because of the impact we have.
[00:50:59.001 --> 00:51:01.747]  And then one step further, why does it matter?
[00:51:03.071 --> 00:51:03.612]  Everyone...
[00:51:04.685 --> 00:51:10.327]  Online pretty much goes to Facebook, Twitter, or Google every day, right?
[00:51:11.107 --> 00:51:16.268]  If you are in a debate, because I'm someone that does this constantly, someone says, look it up.
[00:51:16.708 --> 00:51:17.329]  Where do you go?
[00:51:17.749 --> 00:51:18.509]  You go to Google.
[00:51:19.149 --> 00:51:20.870]  Well, I've noticed this recently.
[00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:21.870]  This is a sea change.
[00:51:22.090 --> 00:51:28.872]  It used to be if you type certain things into Google like Bill Clinton rape victims or Bill Clinton rape or Hillary Clinton Saudi Arabia money.
[00:51:29.392 --> 00:51:31.633]  You would get sources from all across the web.
[00:51:31.653 --> 00:51:33.534]  You'd get Breitbart, all these stories.
[00:51:34.054 --> 00:51:39.836]  Now when you search stuff like that, you only get the left-wing outlets first.
[00:51:40.176 --> 00:51:41.997]  Huffington Post, Snopes.
[00:51:42.597 --> 00:51:48.159]  It's the wildest thing and it's slowly happening more and more.
[00:51:48.259 --> 00:51:49.740]  So the issue here is,
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:52:01.886]  If you've got Facebook, Google, Twitter, and all of these major corporations censoring free speech essentially, controlling what people are seeing, well now they're controlling the paradigm.
[00:52:01.906 --> 00:52:03.166]  They're controlling perspective.
[00:52:03.186 --> 00:52:04.447]  They're controlling reality.
[00:52:04.847 --> 00:52:05.828]  That's what they want to do.
[00:52:06.168 --> 00:52:08.869]  That's the internet ghettos that Matt Drudge was talking about.
[00:52:09.209 --> 00:52:10.990]  That's why this is a big issue.
[00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:14.012]  They are trying to control what people see and what they think.
[00:52:14.437 --> 00:52:14.657]  Right.
[00:52:14.958 --> 00:52:30.555]  And actually, Millie, you were there and played a major role in helping Donald Trump get elected by just being out there at those protests and being able to capture video of Hillary Clinton being ill and speaking with people, dialoguing, the size of the crowds.
[00:52:30.915 --> 00:52:31.536]  Exactly.
[00:52:31.556 --> 00:52:35.520]  I mean, the coverage that we provided as InfoWars
[00:52:36.041 --> 00:52:42.066]  During the Trump election was very important and pretty crucial to Trump's victory.
[00:52:42.346 --> 00:52:52.894]  And if we didn't have that ability, if we didn't imagine if they tried to shut us down even before the election, they would have succeeded in getting Hillary Clinton the presidency.
[00:52:53.014 --> 00:52:54.255]  I really do believe that.
[00:52:54.275 --> 00:52:56.637]  And that's why right now we are under attack.
[00:52:56.677 --> 00:53:02.021]  You know, Trump may have won the presidency and we may have won that battle.
[00:53:02.261 --> 00:53:03.602]  But the war is not over.
[00:53:03.622 --> 00:53:04.022]  It's still going on.
[00:53:04.042 --> 00:53:06.683]  And they know it and they are still pressing forward.
[00:53:06.843 --> 00:53:18.488]  Right, and we reported about how George Soros and other groups are actually backing now Google and other French outlets so that they won't lose their leg in France with Marie Le Pen, the election coming up there.
[00:53:18.548 --> 00:53:24.651]  They want to make sure that they can control that there and not see the loss go to their globalist puppet that they want to put in.
[00:53:25.131 --> 00:53:35.217]  So this is another reason why we want to take InfoWars out, because we are one of those outlets that people, French citizens, can come to and get actual, real reporting about what's going on in their country.
[00:53:35.237 --> 00:53:36.278]  Well, and think about this.
[00:53:36.558 --> 00:53:42.782]  They had already controlled, to a very large extent, if not full control, over the television spectrum.
[00:53:43.422 --> 00:53:56.946]  So they've been able to control so much of reality, so much of the news, so much of the media, just with their control on television and all the corporations that own all of the television entities, and a lot of them end up owning a lot of the written publications too, but just on TV.
[00:53:57.306 --> 00:53:59.767]  So now what they saw is that the internet has now
[00:54:00.427 --> 00:54:02.989]  I guess pun intended, Trumped TV.
[00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:10.196]  And so Trump was kind of the first person, I forget who coined this, but somebody said this on the Jones Show, Trump was the first person elected by social media.
[00:54:10.477 --> 00:54:12.478]  Trump was the first person elected by the internet.
[00:54:12.719 --> 00:54:18.744]  So now we're in this new age where it's the internet that's going to help decide the outcome of the election, not just the TV.
[00:54:18.784 --> 00:54:20.226]  We saw it in history with radio and TV.
[00:54:20.446 --> 00:54:22.568]  So now they've got to get their control over the internet.
[00:54:22.788 --> 00:54:24.990]  And just so people understand the ins and outs of this.
[00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:28.052]  Basically, you've seen how ad sharing works.
[00:54:28.072 --> 00:54:32.214]  Whenever you go to a website, you see a bunch of just random ads, a conglomeration of different ads.
[00:54:32.234 --> 00:54:33.915]  Some of them just have crazy headlines.
[00:54:33.935 --> 00:54:35.576]  Some might be health, this, that, or the other thing.
[00:54:35.957 --> 00:54:38.338]  And you see these in different columns around different ads.
[00:54:38.739 --> 00:54:40.019]  And InfoWars was part of that.
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:41.620]  That's how people found our products.
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:43.242]  That's how we got some of our news out there.
[00:54:43.462 --> 00:54:46.884]  Well, now they've pulled that, and we no longer have that access.
[00:54:46.944 --> 00:54:48.925]  Just so people understand the ins and outs.
[00:54:48.945 --> 00:54:50.026]  And again, that story is on InfoWars.
[00:54:50.066 --> 00:54:51.147]  Look at how massive this is.
[00:54:51.187 --> 00:54:58.712]  I mean, we truly have always been able to carry ourselves because of the high quality products that we sell to our listeners out there.
[00:54:58.752 --> 00:55:00.534]  So that's how we've been able to succeed.
[00:55:00.574 --> 00:55:02.815]  We haven't had to get in bed with the goblins, so to speak.
[00:55:03.136 --> 00:55:18.287]  But that ad share revenue really is going to, you know, that's actually the money that Jones took from the ad share revenue was what he used to hire all of the new employees that you see here, as well as to extend the studio and build one of our new studios.
[00:55:18.687 --> 00:55:25.229]  So that is going to be a huge hit to us, which is why it's so important now more than ever to help support this broadcast by the products.
[00:55:25.489 --> 00:55:29.370]  But I wanted to just point out something that's so ironic that's happening now.
[00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:36.832]  A lot of independent cinemas, I think 90 cinemas across the United States, are going to be airing the movie 1984 in protest
[00:55:39.733 --> 00:55:40.414]  Of Donald Trump.
[00:55:40.774 --> 00:55:41.835]  How ironic is that?
[00:55:41.935 --> 00:55:48.619]  They are airing 1984 specifically because of his alleged proposed cuts on cultural institutions.
[00:55:49.020 --> 00:56:03.850]  But this is good because now a whole new generation of people is going to understand exactly this story of 1984 and how Donald Trump and electing him was our way of stopping Ingsoc in 1984 and the Ministry of Truth.
[00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:04.571]  President
[00:56:05.151 --> 00:56:05.411]  I don't
[00:56:20.166 --> 00:56:22.687]  Blocking of the media and shutting down alternative media.
[00:56:22.727 --> 00:56:26.148]  This was something that was put in place way before Trump got elected.
[00:56:26.728 --> 00:56:28.808]  But they talk about it here in this article.
[00:56:28.949 --> 00:56:36.991]  Orwell's portrait of a government that manufactures their own facts, demands total obedience, and demonizes foreign enemies has never been timelier.
[00:56:37.671 --> 00:56:38.592]  What the heck?
[00:56:38.712 --> 00:56:42.356]  Donald Trump has only been in office for one month and that's what he's been fighting against.
[00:56:42.616 --> 00:56:47.982]  Thought control, the ministry of truthiness, total obedience, demonizing foreign enemies.
[00:56:48.022 --> 00:56:55.130]  They were going after Russia and putting Russia out as the boogeyman before it was even, you know, they've got to have a boogeyman to fight against.
[00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:55.931]  Exactly.
[00:56:56.031 --> 00:57:11.749]  And you know, speaking of 1984, you know, Google and all of these companies, we've seen how Google bought up YouTube and, you know, they're really just trying to monopolize the portals that we use to express our freedom of speech.
[00:57:12.190 --> 00:57:13.612]  And as you were talking on 1984, you know,
[00:57:14.853 --> 00:57:24.681]  This technology with the internet, it allows us to voice our rights, to share our beliefs, and to obtain the ultimate form and expressions of freedom.
[00:57:25.161 --> 00:57:29.645]  But, if we allow them to win this battle against free speech,
[00:57:30.205 --> 00:57:37.027]  Then this technology can be used to police us in a horrifying way, just like in 1984.
[00:57:37.227 --> 00:57:37.767]  Absolutely.
[00:57:37.807 --> 00:57:42.009]  And so that is why we are launching a 13-hour broadcast.
[00:57:42.029 --> 00:57:44.289]  It's going to start tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:46.590]  Central Standard Time with the Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:48.551]  We're all going to be here 13 hours.
[00:57:48.611 --> 00:57:52.592]  It's the Defense of Liberty 13-hour special broadcast.
[00:57:53.172 --> 00:57:57.274]  I mean, this ban is a critical blow to the heart of the info war.
[00:57:57.314 --> 00:57:59.736]  We are a totally independent media organization.
[00:58:00.076 --> 00:58:04.858]  We receive absolutely no funding from government groups or megacorporations.
[00:58:04.978 --> 00:58:06.880]  We are user funded.
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:16.785]  We are able to run this entire operation because of people out there who love liberty and want to support the truth and want to make sure that this information continues.
[00:58:17.265 --> 00:58:18.065]  To get out there.
[00:58:18.125 --> 00:58:20.926]  So I know that, you know, we'll all be there as well.
[00:58:21.386 --> 00:58:25.887]  But this is the time for you guys to go to the InfoWars store, buy the products.
[00:58:25.947 --> 00:58:29.248]  I guarantee Jones is working behind the scenes on some specials right now.
[00:58:30.108 --> 00:58:31.888]  It's the Defend the InfoWars special.
[00:58:31.968 --> 00:58:42.911]  He's going to be running these massive specials all day long, but we're going to be losing a very large percentage of our total income that Jones would use to hire more reporters.
[00:58:42.971 --> 00:58:44.611]  He said he wanted to hire a hundred more.
[00:58:45.191 --> 00:58:52.402]  So, I guarantee if we're able to raise enough money and kind of give the middle finger to the globalists in their latest move to try to knock us out.
[00:58:53.003 --> 00:58:55.367]  But that's all going to happen tomorrow.
[00:58:55.527 --> 00:58:56.328]  Starts at 11 a.m.
[00:58:56.368 --> 00:58:56.709]  Central.
[00:58:56.989 --> 00:58:58.011]  We will see you there.
[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.932]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.393 --> 00:59:20.121]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.442 --> 00:59:24.185]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.746 --> 00:59:27.588]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:36.017]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
[00:59:36.317 --> 00:59:38.620]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:59:39.261 --> 00:59:41.723]  Well, we're bringing you a total win-win.
[00:59:42.104 --> 00:59:47.610]  The ultimate value, cutting-edge, trailblazing game-changer that also supports the info war.
[00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:54.693]  We have produced a limited run of DNA Force and it will take up to 12 weeks to produce more once we sell out.
[00:59:55.053 --> 00:59:59.895]  Secure your DNA Force today at InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
