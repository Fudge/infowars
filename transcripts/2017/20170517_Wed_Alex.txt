[00:00:02.022 --> 00:00:04.123]  They took my saddle in Houston.
[00:00:04.283 --> 00:00:07.846]  Broke my leg in Santa Fe.
[00:00:09.987 --> 00:00:15.991]  Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way.
[00:00:16.031 --> 00:00:19.073]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:22.415]  I'll be looking for aid when they pull that gate.
[00:00:23.336 --> 00:00:25.817]  And I hope that judge ain't blind.
[00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:29.860]  I'm a rebel by morning.
[00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:36.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, we wanted a president to stand up against the globalists.
[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.522]  We wanted a president to actually be president and make the major decisions.
[00:00:40.742 --> 00:00:42.063]  And that is now happening.
[00:00:43.303 --> 00:00:51.487]  And so all the special interests that have hijacked this nation are now in an information war of lies and deception against our president.
[00:00:51.947 --> 00:00:57.370]  Colonel Schaefer, the former head of the operations against Al Qaeda, and a former CIA analyst as well,
[00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:10.157]  has gone public saying that the president is in an information war and a battle with criminal elements of the deep state to take him out and he must realize he's in a war and must have a battle plan.
[00:01:10.177 --> 00:01:14.039]  We're going to go to that clip coming up in the next segment.
[00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:27.444]  Part of that battle plan, obviously, is to remove the president so that they can punish the nationalists in this country and send us a message that we'll never again be allowed to actually run our country or be in control of it.
[00:01:28.342 --> 00:01:39.588]  Look at the CNBC headline, Dow drops 250 points, S&P and Nasdaq fall 1% as Trump worries send shivers down Wall Street.
[00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:51.155]  And you can see behind me if you're watching on television exactly what's happening with the Dow Jones plunging for the first time in the last four or five months.
[00:01:52.255 --> 00:01:52.996]  Because with Trump,
[00:01:54.178 --> 00:01:55.539]  We're going to have better business deals.
[00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:56.980]  With Trump, we're going to have cheaper energy.
[00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.722]  With Trump, we're going to have a open for business mentality.
[00:02:03.964 --> 00:02:08.967]  With Trump, we're going to have someone that actually is looking out for free market systems.
[00:02:09.007 --> 00:02:12.029]  The problem is the globalists want a crony capitalist operation.
[00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:20.555]  Now I know you the listeners and viewers know this, but I got on the phone with Dr. Corsi and others this morning and I said we have to have a battle plan
[00:02:21.513 --> 00:02:32.661]  For the American people, and for good people in Congress, and for the governors, and for the legislators, and for others, to take action as aggressively as we can within the law against these globalists.
[00:02:32.721 --> 00:02:34.282]  Because this is a fifth column.
[00:02:35.703 --> 00:02:49.634]  In between writing articles about how they want to overthrow the president, you've got New Yorker magazine, a very elite publication, saying we should have never had America, and America's evil, and George Washington was bad, and an image of a minute man sitting on top of a world of skulls.
[00:02:50.814 --> 00:03:07.785]  So the world is a horrible place where the United States produces most of the wealth in the world so that 48% of the population don't have to work and then call for Trump's impeachment because he dare get $3 trillion in the stock market and hundreds of billions of new jobs for them to suck off of.
[00:03:08.806 --> 00:03:11.708]  But again, there is an evil instinct to the parasites
[00:03:12.964 --> 00:03:21.570]  That they want to dominate, and they want to control, and they want to run the other 52% that actually produces.
[00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.854]  And they have a crazed, out-of-their-mind mentality that they're in an existential battle.
[00:03:28.455 --> 00:03:35.079]  They're like a drowning person, projecting all their problems, all their issues onto us, and it's legendary.
[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.262]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to break down when we come back from a break with the President in East Zoo.
[00:03:38.302 --> 00:03:41.344]  I'm going to lay out the latest news, but here's the deal.
[00:03:42.717 --> 00:03:49.921]  Obama committed massive crimes starting in his second administration, ordering ICE to let illegals pour into the United States.
[00:03:50.761 --> 00:03:52.842]  They covered it up by saying, oh, it's children.
[00:03:52.882 --> 00:03:55.003]  No, it was 17% below the age of 18.
[00:03:56.204 --> 00:03:57.845]  Didn't vet them for diseases, anything.
[00:03:58.825 --> 00:03:59.806]  Didn't even care about them.
[00:03:59.826 --> 00:04:02.107]  It was about getting rid of the borders, setting a precedent.
[00:04:02.607 --> 00:04:05.409]  That right there was an impeachable offense, but Congress didn't do anything.
[00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:13.863]  We went out on the border and broke that news with emergency managers admitting it on tape and Border Patrol telling us on video.
[00:04:15.764 --> 00:04:16.684]  InfoWars broke that.
[00:04:16.724 --> 00:04:22.686]  That's why they hate the fact we're here, because we'll bring out information nobody else will touch because it is so powerful, because it is so dangerous.
[00:04:23.126 --> 00:04:30.809]  He ordered, under dereliction of duty, the Border Patrol to ignore the law and to let people in
[00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:40.617]  The FBI, Comey didn't do jack diddly-squat about that, but oh, in a meeting, he's there with the President saying, gee, I sure hope, you know, in your case, that you're able to drop this on Flynn.
[00:04:40.637 --> 00:04:41.878]  Didn't say you're ordered to drop it.
[00:04:42.118 --> 00:04:44.000]  Didn't say, I'm the President, I'm telling you to do this.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.141]  That would be obstruction.
[00:04:45.441 --> 00:04:47.623]  He said, gee, I sure hope we can get this moving forward.
[00:04:47.683 --> 00:04:48.704]  I think he's a good guy, don't you?
[00:04:49.184 --> 00:04:50.605]  FBI Director, yeah, I think he's a great guy.
[00:04:51.426 --> 00:04:52.647]  That's the transcript, supposedly.
[00:04:53.087 --> 00:04:54.969]  They turned that into Trump's the threat.
[00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.090]  No, Trump's the threat to the globalists.
[00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.431]  That's why they want him gone.
[00:04:58.471 --> 00:04:58.912]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.343 --> 00:05:02.905]  Seth Rich is back in the news.
[00:05:02.925 --> 00:05:03.586]  Do you remember him?
[00:05:03.646 --> 00:05:04.728]  He was the D.C.
[00:05:04.768 --> 00:05:07.692]  staffer who was shot in the back, but nothing was stolen from him.
[00:05:07.872 --> 00:05:14.240]  Most people think he is the source of the DNC leaks that ended up on WikiLeaks last year during the 2016 presidential campaign.
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.123]  Enter Rod Wheeler, a former D.C.
[00:05:16.163 --> 00:05:18.706]  police homicide detective hired by the family to run a
[00:05:19.126 --> 00:05:30.814]  We were told to stand down on this case, and I can't share any information with you.
[00:05:30.854 --> 00:05:34.817]  Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department.
[00:05:34.857 --> 00:05:39.340]  When asked if there's information that links Seth Rich to WikiLeaks, Wheeler replied, absolutely.
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.681]  Yeah, that's confirmed.
[00:05:40.821 --> 00:05:41.842]  Now, of course, the D.C.
[00:05:41.862 --> 00:05:44.064]  police are saying, oh no, there's no cover-up.
[00:05:44.104 --> 00:05:47.166]  Neither they nor the FBI have been helping Wheeler out in this case.
[00:05:47.466 --> 00:05:53.369]  Alex Jones broke all this down in a video back in August of 2016 titled, Does Assange Have Proof of Clinton Murder?
[00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:55.990]  Hashtag Seth Rich is trending on Twitter.
[00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.751]  Let's see how long it takes him to bury it.
[00:05:57.811 --> 00:06:00.853]  Roger reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:06:01.273 --> 00:06:12.919]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:15.602]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[00:06:15.782 --> 00:06:18.606]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[00:06:19.046 --> 00:06:20.348]  It's made in the USA.
[00:06:20.989 --> 00:06:29.400]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.962]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:06:32.163 --> 00:06:35.945]  Our formula at InfoWarsLife.com is quite frankly simple.
[00:06:36.645 --> 00:06:43.189]  We go out and look at the recognized research and we take it to the next level of quality, of purity,
[00:06:44.338 --> 00:06:44.438]  Yes.
[00:07:06.471 --> 00:07:06.951]  When it comes
[00:07:26.121 --> 00:07:35.950]  You owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world, that patriots stay as healthy, and as clean, and as focused as you can be.
[00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:44.298]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level, and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:07:44.498 --> 00:07:51.084]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the New World Order.
[00:07:52.208 --> 00:07:56.019]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:00.551]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com
[00:08:03.095 --> 00:08:03.656]  News.
[00:08:04.156 --> 00:08:05.037]  Analysis.
[00:08:05.538 --> 00:08:06.219]  Reports.
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.182]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:09.462 --> 00:08:12.606]  Sweet dreams are made of this.
[00:08:12.946 --> 00:08:16.210]  Who am I to disagree?
[00:08:16.571 --> 00:08:20.175]  I travel the world and the seven seas.
[00:08:20.916 --> 00:08:23.899]  Everybody's looking for something.
[00:08:40.191 --> 00:08:54.940]  It was about a month and a half ago, in March, that Atlantic Monthly, one of the most elite globalist publications, where they actually communicate with each other, like Foreign Affairs, or New Yorker Magazine, or the Financial Times of London.
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.941]  Pretty much everything else is for public consumption.
[00:08:58.882 --> 00:09:09.288]  And if you read the New Yorker, if you read Atlantic Monthly, if you read The Economist, that's another one, they are openly saying, overthrow Trump, kill Trump,
[00:09:10.768 --> 00:09:20.535]  And use continuity of government to remove the entire Tea Party Freedom Caucus, claiming they're all Russian agents, and use the military to do it.
[00:09:21.937 --> 00:09:30.843]  Now, at that time, when I covered the article rewriting the rules of presidential succession, you notice I told you months before they'd use COG.
[00:09:32.204 --> 00:09:34.066]  And they'd use the parallel FEMA government.
[00:09:35.267 --> 00:09:44.110]  That's designed, originally, if we get hit with a nuclear attack or an asteroid or a mass plague, whatever the case may be, that there's an emergency backup government.
[00:09:44.151 --> 00:09:51.733]  But always that emergency backup government can then plan in parallel and with funding to create their own coup d'etat.
[00:09:53.234 --> 00:09:54.855]  And this happens in many other nations.
[00:09:55.755 --> 00:10:00.357]  And there's been behind-the-scenes attempts at using COG previously to bring down Ronald Reagan.
[00:10:02.162 --> 00:10:04.783]  In fact, the COG intended him to die in 1981.
[00:10:05.064 --> 00:10:06.564]  He didn't die from a gunshot wound.
[00:10:09.266 --> 00:10:13.408]  And so the deep state that had become activated by Alexander Haig then had to pull back.
[00:10:13.428 --> 00:10:21.053]  And of course it was Alexander Haig, who many experts believe was Deep Throat, that helped bring down Nixon as well.
[00:10:21.073 --> 00:10:24.835]  Along with Naval Intelligence Officer Bob Woodward.
[00:10:25.854 --> 00:10:35.601]  This time it's a little bit different because a lot of the deep state is actually for Trump, wants Americana, wants prosperity, and doesn't want the destruction of this country.
[00:10:40.445 --> 00:10:46.669]  Now, here's what I'm going to lay out for you today.
[00:10:47.189 --> 00:10:51.533]  Several big points, and I hope that Congress listens, I hope that
[00:10:52.421 --> 00:10:53.361]  The president listens.
[00:10:53.421 --> 00:10:54.282]  I hope you listen.
[00:10:54.322 --> 00:10:55.962]  I hope our radio affiliates listen.
[00:10:56.562 --> 00:10:57.923]  I hope foreign governments listen.
[00:10:57.963 --> 00:11:02.684]  I hope the whole world pays attention because I've studied how our government really works.
[00:11:03.484 --> 00:11:04.585]  I've studied the deep state.
[00:11:05.005 --> 00:11:06.465]  Used that term 20 plus years ago.
[00:11:08.366 --> 00:11:13.447]  Shadow government I used 20 plus years ago because those are real terms that were there starting back in the 50s.
[00:11:15.548 --> 00:11:17.689]  I just became aware of it in the last 25 years.
[00:11:19.474 --> 00:11:32.999]  And so, they love to call me a conspiracy theorist and just throw that out there, but if you turn on the news now, Fox News, they're saying, information war is being used against the president in an attempt to overthrow him, so multinationals can take over the United States.
[00:11:33.019 --> 00:11:37.881]  You tune over to CNN, Dana Bash goes, yeah, this is deep state revenge against Trump.
[00:11:37.921 --> 00:11:38.661]  We're taking over.
[00:11:39.401 --> 00:11:45.044]  Chuckie Schumer's out there saying, the intelligence community's got six ways to Sunday to bring you down, Trump.
[00:11:45.084 --> 00:11:45.864]  Better watch your butt.
[00:11:47.725 --> 00:12:02.931]  Globalism, world government, carbon taxes, one-child policies, AI supercomputers, total surveillance, everything I laid out 20 years ago is now water-cooler talk.
[00:12:04.111 --> 00:12:04.472]  Every.
[00:12:05.072 --> 00:12:05.532]  Single.
[00:12:06.112 --> 00:12:06.372]  Day.
[00:12:07.693 --> 00:12:12.555]  Now, everybody might want to hear what's coming next, because I'm going to tell you
[00:12:13.922 --> 00:12:20.268]  The different avenues we've got here, kind of like those novels you read back in junior high that have choose your own adventure, that have three or four different endings.
[00:12:21.669 --> 00:12:26.253]  Let me go through the different scenarios that we're going to go down here.
[00:12:26.734 --> 00:12:40.005]  And it could be a mix of several of these, but I'm going to tell you exactly where we were, where we are, and boy lordy, lordy lordy, to quote the former FBI director, where we're going.
[00:12:40.754 --> 00:12:58.720]  And I suggest everyone get out pencils and paper, and I suggest everybody have a real discussion about this, and people look into what I'm going to say, what we're going to put on screen, and the clips we're going to play, because they're not planning a soft coup if they're successful taking on Trump.
[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.060]  They're going to shut down the independent media.
[00:13:02.981 --> 00:13:04.301]  They're going to charge people.
[00:13:04.341 --> 00:13:05.442]  They're going to arrest people.
[00:13:05.482 --> 00:13:06.962]  They're going to re-educate people.
[00:13:07.222 --> 00:13:09.703]  That is all in the current Pentagon manuals.
[00:13:11.195 --> 00:13:13.737]  Why do you think the Pentagon got upset and helped put Trump in?
[00:13:13.977 --> 00:13:16.319]  Because they knew what the next phase was with Hillary.
[00:13:16.599 --> 00:13:19.522]  Shutting down the press, arresting her opposition en masse.
[00:13:20.462 --> 00:13:24.346]  And it's not that the military and even the smarter guys at the CIA are angels.
[00:13:24.946 --> 00:13:32.092]  They understand it will trigger an extended, long-term, bloody, hot war in this country.
[00:13:34.568 --> 00:13:39.311]  So they're people that want stability, they want free market, they want prosperity.
[00:13:39.671 --> 00:13:41.752]  It's better for America, it's better for the world.
[00:13:42.593 --> 00:13:47.936]  Socialism, collectivism, crony capitalism is a nightmare and only works for the one-tenth of one percent.
[00:13:48.337 --> 00:13:59.163]  So, the people that just want stability and business and don't want to mount America's head on the wall, they're trying desperately to block the next phase.
[00:13:59.824 --> 00:14:03.466]  See, Trump's just holding back what was already about to be put in place.
[00:14:05.148 --> 00:14:07.331]  I'm going to lay down the facts.
[00:14:08.112 --> 00:14:08.753]  I'm going to lay them out.
[00:14:10.455 --> 00:14:15.561]  Where we've been, where we are, where we're going.
[00:14:15.581 --> 00:14:17.324]  But let me just give you a basic summation here.
[00:14:19.847 --> 00:14:22.851]  In the last four or five months I've told you, since he was president-elect,
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:33.187]  This is a deep state coup d'etat operation to undermine him, to destroy him in the public eye first, and then they're not going to let Trump go to prison or even step down.
[00:14:33.227 --> 00:14:33.928]  They know he won't.
[00:14:34.308 --> 00:14:35.449]  They're going to kill him.
[00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.011]  And the best minds agree with me.
[00:14:38.312 --> 00:14:40.994]  They're going to kill him at the peak of the investigation.
[00:14:41.554 --> 00:14:43.396]  Donald Trump is a dead man.
[00:14:44.156 --> 00:14:45.037]  He's a dead man.
[00:14:46.138 --> 00:14:46.638]  He's dead.
[00:14:47.099 --> 00:14:51.022]  He's walking dead right now unless we counter this.
[00:14:51.282 --> 00:14:52.864]  Because I'm not just going to lay out where we've been.
[00:14:54.036 --> 00:15:01.621]  Where we are, where we're going, we can change where we're going if we admit how much trouble we're in.
[00:15:01.641 --> 00:15:03.802]  And let me say something else to everybody.
[00:15:05.103 --> 00:15:06.824]  A lot of you claim you want to fight tyranny.
[00:15:06.844 --> 00:15:09.245]  A lot of you claim you wanted free market.
[00:15:09.265 --> 00:15:11.207]  A lot of you claim you want to be American.
[00:15:12.107 --> 00:15:14.869]  Our forebearers had to fight bloody wars for what we've got.
[00:15:17.768 --> 00:15:30.918]  If you won't fight information war, if you won't spend money in this fight, if you won't buy time on local radio, if you won't call C-SPAN, if you won't put billboards up, if you won't go talk to your State House, if you won't go talk to your Congress people in D.C.
[00:15:31.118 --> 00:15:37.383]  and get them by the hand and tell them you know what's going on and if they go along with this takeover of America, they're going to be held accountable.
[00:15:37.643 --> 00:15:44.068]  If you don't do that, we're going to lose the information war and then we don't have any
[00:15:45.444 --> 00:15:47.826]  Recourse, but to defend ourselves, because let me tell you something.
[00:15:48.566 --> 00:15:50.528]  These people, these globalists, they want us.
[00:15:50.608 --> 00:15:53.270]  They have said they want to snuff us out once and for all.
[00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:55.611]  This is an existential war you're in.
[00:15:55.831 --> 00:16:10.462]  The very same Bolsheviks that came out of New York and London and Paris and major German cities like Berlin that took over Russia.
[00:16:12.028 --> 00:16:13.591]  And exterminated the Christians in mass?
[00:16:14.393 --> 00:16:19.383]  That same disease is in America!
[00:16:20.652 --> 00:16:23.575]  And plans a hot Bolshevik war.
[00:16:23.875 --> 00:16:31.062]  David Horowitz was brought up in New York City by parents that came out of this, and he'll warn you all day, they want to kill everybody!
[00:16:31.722 --> 00:16:33.644]  And I'm just telling you right now, they mean business.
[00:16:33.844 --> 00:16:42.913]  They will line you and your family up, and they'll shoot you in the head, and they'll rape your daughters, and they'll kill your sons, and they'll make your wife work in a field till she dies.
[00:16:44.079 --> 00:16:46.480]  So, you want to understand where we're at?
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:53.622]  We've got the Bolshevik Revolution 2.0 with a crazy Nazi collaborator, George Soros, who you know is making money.
[00:16:53.942 --> 00:17:04.666]  They knew as soon as this impeachment stuff got launched, and as soon as Republicans started getting on board, the stock market started plunging, you can bet every red cent in your little piggy bank, George Soros is making a bunch of money today off this.
[00:17:05.745 --> 00:17:07.746]  But that's okay because he's a Nazi collaborator.
[00:17:07.786 --> 00:17:08.526]  He's above the law.
[00:17:08.546 --> 00:17:18.069]  It's okay for Obama to open the borders up and ignore the law and bring in illegals and bring in folks with diseases and not even vet them and violate all these federal laws because he's above the law.
[00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:24.390]  Oh, but Trump probably, you know, might have said, oh, you know, I hope you can see it through, you know, in your own research.
[00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:26.011]  I hope we don't have to charge him with anything.
[00:17:28.305 --> 00:17:33.510]  That's totally, that's the President, but anybody can say, I sure hope that nothing's here, I hope this doesn't have to go forward.
[00:17:33.811 --> 00:17:35.272]  I think he's a great guy, I don't think he did anything.
[00:17:35.873 --> 00:17:36.894]  That's the President's free speech.
[00:17:37.334 --> 00:17:45.022]  That's not even obstruction of justice, but the President says that's not accurate, and what wasn't said, and that's why he's got it recorded.
[00:17:46.043 --> 00:17:49.266]  And notice, no one gets to see the memo, no one knows who said it.
[00:17:49.366 --> 00:17:52.089]  It's okay though, because the deep state says so.
[00:17:54.755 --> 00:18:00.256]  So we're going to lose this whole country because the globalists want to militarily, politically capture it.
[00:18:00.636 --> 00:18:02.036]  They already had it partially captured.
[00:18:02.236 --> 00:18:03.076]  That's where we've been.
[00:18:04.697 --> 00:18:05.717]  Controlled for decades.
[00:18:10.518 --> 00:18:11.238]  Manipulated.
[00:18:11.678 --> 00:18:13.518]  All these cowards put musicians to power.
[00:18:14.078 --> 00:18:23.160]  All these big oligarch combines of corporations and groups that are milking us and consolidating control and shutting down their competition and dumbing down the population to secure their victory.
[00:18:24.255 --> 00:18:26.396]  None of them ever stick their head up above the grass, though.
[00:18:26.636 --> 00:18:30.757]  They all just, as a combine, commit their crimes and slowly take over society.
[00:18:31.017 --> 00:18:34.739]  And now we got to the point where they want to bring in millions of unwashed radical Islamists.
[00:18:35.479 --> 00:18:37.280]  And they want to further break up our families.
[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:41.501]  And they want to tell us there are no genders, male and female, existing or bad, and hurt others.
[00:18:41.541 --> 00:18:42.201]  This is all happening.
[00:18:42.221 --> 00:18:43.882]  And Mother's Day is banned.
[00:18:44.222 --> 00:18:51.925]  And so they want to fully conquer us as a civilization, use what's left of America's wealth and power to expand their unelected corporate world government.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.121]  So that's where we are.
[00:18:55.002 --> 00:18:56.543]  But their carbon taxes are getting killed.
[00:18:56.783 --> 00:19:02.388]  Their foreign multinational TPP of total takeover of Congressional power is killed by President Trump.
[00:19:02.608 --> 00:19:04.470]  The coal they turned off is killed by Trump.
[00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:06.992]  He's making it cool to be American again.
[00:19:07.212 --> 00:19:08.273]  He's bringing sovereignty back.
[00:19:08.313 --> 00:19:09.294]  He's bringing wealth back.
[00:19:09.514 --> 00:19:11.416]  So you don't want to be the 48% that don't work.
[00:19:11.656 --> 00:19:13.577]  Because you can make a lot of money actually working.
[00:19:14.058 --> 00:19:16.240]  He's turning the engine of liberty back on.
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:17.501]  The engine of renaissance.
[00:19:17.561 --> 00:19:18.322]  And they're panicking.
[00:19:18.602 --> 00:19:19.703]  That's where we are.
[00:19:20.953 --> 00:19:30.637]  And all their propaganda and all their lies got defeated and patriots in the government, like Seth Rich and the Democratic Party, burned them and exposed what criminals they are.
[00:19:31.517 --> 00:19:39.401]  And now the whole deep state and the EU and the Vatican and the Communist Chinese, all of them are focused against America.
[00:19:41.441 --> 00:19:47.444]  All the forces of Mordor against Midas Tirith, if you want to use the archetypal example of Lord of the Rings.
[00:19:48.764 --> 00:19:53.049]  All the power focused to bring us down once and for all and to destroy Trump.
[00:19:53.309 --> 00:19:58.936]  And if Trump falls, make no mistake, our chances of fixing things peacefully are falling.
[00:19:59.036 --> 00:19:59.797]  America's dying.
[00:20:00.686 --> 00:20:04.527]  I want to tell you about some of the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:20:04.547 --> 00:20:06.428]  We are under constant attack.
[00:20:06.908 --> 00:20:09.109]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[00:20:09.309 --> 00:20:12.190]  They're trying to attack us on every level.
[00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:26.554]  Now with the YouTube scandal, they're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[00:20:27.254 --> 00:20:28.875]  They can't get to us that way.
[00:20:29.256 --> 00:20:32.078]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[00:20:32.098 --> 00:20:33.078]  They don't have that power.
[00:20:33.559 --> 00:20:36.080]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.842]  We have Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:20:39.282 --> 00:20:42.144]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:20:42.164 --> 00:20:43.786]  This is by listener request.
[00:20:44.026 --> 00:20:49.289]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[00:20:49.309 --> 00:20:49.870]  Again,
[00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:56.358]  If you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now, then you're absolutely insane.
[00:20:56.779 --> 00:21:01.085]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[00:21:01.686 --> 00:21:05.271]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[00:21:07.533 --> 00:21:10.276]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from us?
[00:21:10.296 --> 00:21:28.691]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at InfoWarsStore.com with the new bubblegum flavor, super blue, fluoride-free toothpaste, and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[00:21:29.031 --> 00:21:31.852]  We don't get put on extremist lists even though they want us to.
[00:21:31.892 --> 00:21:33.913]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[00:21:34.273 --> 00:21:36.273]  That's why we need your support more than ever.
[00:21:36.714 --> 00:21:48.338]  Because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model, to drown out independent voices.
[00:21:48.358 --> 00:21:51.439]  So support us by getting the products at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:22:00.728 --> 00:22:12.415]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:22:12.976 --> 00:22:15.057]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:22:15.257 --> 00:22:18.079]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:22:18.519 --> 00:22:19.720]  It's made in the USA.
[00:22:21.121 --> 00:22:21.461]  I think?
[00:22:43.809 --> 00:22:43.909]  Yes.
[00:23:05.942 --> 00:23:06.422]  When it comes
[00:23:25.609 --> 00:23:35.433]  You owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[00:23:35.493 --> 00:23:43.756]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:23:43.956 --> 00:23:50.538]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the new world order.
[00:23:51.681 --> 00:23:55.463]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:23:55.924 --> 00:23:57.264]  Now it's time to change our bodies.
[00:23:57.905 --> 00:24:00.286]  With Z-Shield and Infowarslive.com.
[00:24:00.666 --> 00:24:01.487]  Federal agents!
[00:24:01.707 --> 00:24:11.953]  We are armed!
[00:24:11.993 --> 00:24:18.497]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna explain this very, very slowly and very, very clearly.
[00:24:20.713 --> 00:24:23.514]  We have to break down what's currently happening in America and all over the world.
[00:24:23.534 --> 00:24:35.961]  We have to lay out who the players are and we have to, as citizens, develop battle plans to defend this republic and to defend other sovereign free market nations.
[00:24:36.902 --> 00:24:41.845]  Now the good news is Australia went under pure carbon taxes and absolute open borders for a while.
[00:24:42.245 --> 00:24:45.747]  The public battled back, took their government back and has reversed much of it.
[00:24:47.717 --> 00:24:48.799]  Same thing happened in England.
[00:24:48.839 --> 00:24:50.041]  Same thing's happening in Iceland.
[00:24:50.221 --> 00:24:52.003]  Italy has said no to EU expansion.
[00:24:52.765 --> 00:24:53.906]  Greece is battling back.
[00:24:54.107 --> 00:24:55.288]  Russia is battling back.
[00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:59.234]  Brazil is just... We can see the numbers on the metrics.
[00:24:59.354 --> 00:25:00.756]  Huge audience out of Brazil.
[00:25:01.809 --> 00:25:06.252]  And I get all sorts of letters and emails and I just see it all over the web.
[00:25:06.312 --> 00:25:11.075]  Brazil knows about the New World Order and is just in total war against socialism.
[00:25:11.095 --> 00:25:16.298]  Because they've seen Venezuela, they've seen Argentina, they've seen rich countries, as rich as the U.S.
[00:25:16.638 --> 00:25:18.299]  Richer, in the case of Argentina.
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:19.480]  Gone.
[00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:21.181]  Socialism.
[00:25:22.442 --> 00:25:24.703]  And it happens over a few generations and then you're totally poor.
[00:25:27.688 --> 00:25:39.819]  And they're living in slums with huge, beautiful buildings that were built 50, 60, 70 years ago all around them and wondering why their grandparents had electricity 24 hours a day and great culture and life and money and then why they have nothing.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.701]  Because you got sold out by socialism.
[00:25:43.203 --> 00:25:46.346]  Because they created a system where the elite live in palaces and then you have nothing.
[00:25:46.866 --> 00:25:48.007]  Socialism doesn't exist.
[00:25:48.087 --> 00:25:48.688]  It's a scam.
[00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:52.852]  But I digress, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:57.455 --> 00:26:03.340]  President Trump... I don't care that the President's called me and thanked me and I've talked to the President.
[00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:04.200]  It means nothing.
[00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:05.181]  I'm not into Hollywood.
[00:26:05.201 --> 00:26:05.942]  I'm not into famous people.
[00:26:07.002 --> 00:26:08.584]  I'm not defending Trump because...
[00:26:10.134 --> 00:26:12.016]  He's like a sports team that I'm a fan of.
[00:26:12.516 --> 00:26:15.179]  Trump is the archetype of America now.
[00:26:15.719 --> 00:26:27.329]  Standing, bullish in the face of the tyrants, the intimidation, the demonization, the lies, them trying to rig the election against him, all the foreign money, all the foreign intelligence, all the horrible things done to his family.
[00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:32.271]  The weakness of many people in his family, but he still brings them along with him.
[00:26:32.471 --> 00:26:50.937]  The weakness of the people he pulls from in the Republican Party, but still delivering on the economy, delivering on sovereignty, delivering on standing against ISIS that Obama helped create, defending Christians, speaking out about the genocide of Christians, doing amazing things, getting a good Supreme Court justice in.
[00:26:51.277 --> 00:26:53.878]  So, let me tell you, we've talked about the past and the present.
[00:26:55.069 --> 00:26:55.953]  And what Deep State's doing.
[00:26:55.973 --> 00:26:57.219]  I'll talk more about that in the next segment.
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.449]  But I want to talk about where we're going.
[00:27:00.851 --> 00:27:12.157]  They have said in the Atlantic Monthly and in the New Yorker Magazine and now in Foreign Affairs and now in Public Affairs of the Washington Post all the exact same thing.
[00:27:12.277 --> 00:27:24.023]  A battle plan on overthrowing Trump and then removing all the Republicans that got elected in the last election claiming they're all Rooskies and reversing it all.
[00:27:24.283 --> 00:27:25.023]  The awakening.
[00:27:25.203 --> 00:27:28.005]  The libertarian conservative American awakening.
[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:37.782]  That already has a phalanx beachhead in Congress and in the states and the legislatures.
[00:27:37.882 --> 00:27:43.664]  A total tsunami political realignment that only happens every 80 years or so on average.
[00:27:46.565 --> 00:27:51.607]  The third realignment in our history of the United States of America.
[00:27:51.847 --> 00:27:56.128]  The longest standing continual government in world history.
[00:27:58.376 --> 00:28:00.077]  Because it had a Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[00:28:00.137 --> 00:28:02.197]  Wasn't perfect, but was light years ahead of the rest.
[00:28:03.838 --> 00:28:08.299]  It now is teetering, hanging by a thread.
[00:28:08.319 --> 00:28:09.159]  They love to use that term.
[00:28:09.199 --> 00:28:12.000]  We are hanging by a thread.
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:13.961]  And they're destroying the thread in real time.
[00:28:14.201 --> 00:28:16.122]  We're rebuilding the thread in real time.
[00:28:16.382 --> 00:28:20.823]  It is an epic battle of forces coming together right now.
[00:28:20.983 --> 00:28:23.024]  And everything you do is so critical.
[00:28:23.544 --> 00:28:26.066]  Because we're not fighting tyrants that just want to take over.
[00:28:26.386 --> 00:28:28.087]  They want to destroy our families.
[00:28:28.747 --> 00:28:29.888]  They want to take our guns.
[00:28:29.908 --> 00:28:39.454]  They want to take our private property because they want to social engineer us and run us and fly above us in their jumbo jets while we don't have air conditioning or cars or medicine or education or future.
[00:28:39.754 --> 00:28:42.536]  These are the most greedy, evil people at the U.N.
[00:28:42.556 --> 00:28:44.076]  and the Clinton Foundation and Obama.
[00:28:44.317 --> 00:28:46.538]  They go around to third world countries and rob
[00:28:46.578 --> 00:28:47.459]  We're good to go.
[00:29:05.006 --> 00:29:08.327]  And they see America as the ultimate engine of power.
[00:29:08.867 --> 00:29:20.811]  And if they can just get full control, and if they can just settle their score with the old American system and defeat us, defeat the Renaissance, the old America is the new world, is the future, is the new Atlantis.
[00:29:21.211 --> 00:29:23.312]  If they can just destroy that, they win.
[00:29:24.758 --> 00:29:49.195]  How could you question if Trump isn't for real when the entire corrupt evil system of the world is trying to bring him down and they invert reality and say he's backed by a foreign power that can barely run its own affairs while the EU, the Vatican, the Communist Chinese, all these other countries, globalist groups, Hollywood, the big banks are all waging war against Trump because he represents us!
[00:29:49.676 --> 00:29:51.757]  We are under attack!

[00:33:18.303 --> 00:33:22.767]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:33:23.367 --> 00:33:24.848]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:28.631 --> 00:33:33.915]  Now, coming up, I'm going to lay out their battle plan to bring down Trump.
[00:33:33.955 --> 00:33:38.099]  I've been telling you exactly how they do it from the beginning because I've studied deep state.
[00:33:38.899 --> 00:33:39.880]  I've studied their own writings.
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:41.962]  I'm not bragging when I tell you that.
[00:33:41.982 --> 00:33:43.243]  It's just you must understand
[00:33:44.554 --> 00:33:49.175]  That I am telling you point-blank the reality of what's unfolding and what's happening.
[00:33:50.095 --> 00:34:03.438]  I went and saw a film a few weeks ago called The Promise that's based on AP transcripts and other journalists that were there of exactly what happened just from a bird's eye view and from a personal perspective in the Armenian genocide.
[00:34:07.239 --> 00:34:09.880]  And there's a scene in the film that historically happened
[00:34:10.677 --> 00:34:20.043]  But it condensed several stories that happened on the road trying to get away from the Islamicists, from the Turkish government that were coming to kill the Armenian Christians.
[00:34:21.684 --> 00:34:32.292]  Many villages were dumping out of the hills and were being told that they could go to another town to be rescued, but that town had already been overrun and everybody had been killed, except for a few survivors.
[00:34:33.377 --> 00:34:45.701]  And, despite the fact that the survivors were running the other direction, telling people, we just came from there, they just killed everybody, we don't know where we're going, but we know that way you can't go, the people wanted the lottery ticket.
[00:34:47.101 --> 00:34:50.102]  They wanted to believe, no, there's ships there waiting to save us.
[00:34:50.842 --> 00:34:52.803]  We heard that a few days ago, we're going to get there.
[00:34:52.823 --> 00:34:54.784]  Well, those ships had been driven out.
[00:34:56.004 --> 00:34:58.685]  They'd been occupied by what was left of the Ottoman Empire.
[00:35:01.263 --> 00:35:03.024]  And in the movie, he talks to a big group of people.
[00:35:03.044 --> 00:35:03.924]  They finally listen to him.
[00:35:03.964 --> 00:35:04.844]  He says, I've been there.
[00:35:05.304 --> 00:35:06.385]  They killed my wife.
[00:35:06.445 --> 00:35:07.385]  They killed my family.
[00:35:07.485 --> 00:35:08.506]  Believe me, you need to go.
[00:35:10.066 --> 00:35:12.367]  And the leader of one of the groups says, this man speaks the truth.
[00:35:13.007 --> 00:35:14.088]  Let's stay here and let's fight.
[00:35:14.388 --> 00:35:17.249]  So most of them did survive by going to the hills and fighting.
[00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:22.751]  The point is, I'm here telling you, I've been there, OK?
[00:35:24.608 --> 00:35:25.529]  I've seen what they do.
[00:35:25.609 --> 00:35:26.369]  I've studied history.
[00:35:26.549 --> 00:35:27.270]  I've studied the globals.
[00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:29.351]  I've seen what they've done to me and my family.
[00:35:29.611 --> 00:35:30.732]  A lot of that I can't talk about on air.
[00:35:31.032 --> 00:35:32.573]  Believe me, they're bad folks.
[00:35:33.173 --> 00:35:35.635]  There's no ifs, ands, or buts about the Democratic Party.
[00:35:35.935 --> 00:35:37.656]  Why do you think the Republicans are so scared of them?
[00:35:37.836 --> 00:35:41.038]  Why do you think Glenn Beck rolled over a few years ago and is working with them?
[00:35:41.778 --> 00:35:46.741]  Most people, when they find out just how evil this is, they roll over to it.
[00:35:47.662 --> 00:35:48.322]  Let me tell you something.
[00:35:48.342 --> 00:35:52.145]  The top of the Democratic Party are devil worshipers and pedophiles.
[00:35:52.947 --> 00:35:53.487]  That's a fact.
[00:35:53.547 --> 00:35:54.128]  It's all come out.
[00:35:54.148 --> 00:35:54.788]  Everybody knows it.
[00:35:54.968 --> 00:36:04.914]  They got their PR firms out there, you know, trying to find a few cases where stuff didn't happen to then say there's no such thing as pedophilia while they're on the news saying legalized pedophilia and trying to sexualize your kids.
[00:36:05.175 --> 00:36:15.381]  And Trump has busted over 5,000 pedophiles arrested with children and another 150,000 just got green-lighted to be arrested who were caught in the whole playpen scandal.
[00:36:16.061 --> 00:36:17.762]  Notice none of that happened under Obama.
[00:36:17.983 --> 00:36:21.765]  We're seeing 10 times or more the arrest of pedophiles right now.
[00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:28.414]  And it's in the news one time every time they arrest a thousand here, four hundred there, two hundred here.
[00:36:28.714 --> 00:36:32.476]  It's happening every day and there's almost no coverage.
[00:36:35.799 --> 00:36:41.563]  Trump has green-lighted the police and green-lighted the good people in our government to start going after this.
[00:36:41.583 --> 00:36:45.686]  There's a civil war going on against a pedophile army, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:46.707 --> 00:36:47.828]  You wonder why they're so evil?
[00:36:48.888 --> 00:36:50.670]  Pedophilia is just one level.
[00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:52.291]  The rabbit hole goes deeper.
[00:36:53.769 --> 00:36:58.753]  You've seen all these big bankers and all these big people coming out and saying, listen, it starts out with hookers and drugs.
[00:36:59.174 --> 00:37:01.276]  Next, it's underage hookers, 16 years old.
[00:37:01.976 --> 00:37:04.418]  Then, if you want to be in the club, you've got to have sex with a kid.
[00:37:04.839 --> 00:37:10.784]  And then next, they want you to kill a little kid that they grabbed out of somebody's backyard a week before.
[00:37:11.044 --> 00:37:13.967]  And these people start breaking down on TV saying they couldn't do it.
[00:37:17.734 --> 00:37:19.296]  Oh yeah, that's how you join the club.
[00:37:19.716 --> 00:37:23.281]  You know, Crips and Bloods, or the Eastside Vatos, or the different white supremacist gangs.
[00:37:23.641 --> 00:37:29.428]  You gotta go kill a liquor store owner, you gotta go shoot somebody, you gotta go do something really nasty, you gotta hit an old lady in the head with a hammer.
[00:37:29.929 --> 00:37:33.413]  All of them have different rituals to prove you're really bad, and they have bad stuff on you.
[00:37:33.473 --> 00:37:36.677]  In the real gangs, you rape little kids and you kill them.
[00:37:37.679 --> 00:37:44.141]  And let's just get it out in the open why they hate me so much, and why they hate the Patriots, and why they're trying to bring me down.
[00:37:44.261 --> 00:37:48.982]  Because behind the scenes, folks, I'm funding military groups, Patriot groups, you name it.
[00:37:49.002 --> 00:37:54.064]  They're legally and lawfully running operations here inside the United States to document and bring all this out.
[00:37:54.284 --> 00:37:55.964]  We're not just here on air doing all this.
[00:37:56.745 --> 00:37:57.545]  And I'm going to leave it there.
[00:38:03.533 --> 00:38:16.565]  So understand, if you don't sign on to defeat the NWO, if you don't sign on to fight the globalists, and if you sit there and play into it, oh, maybe he did try to influence the director, oh, maybe Trump is in trouble and kind of get on the bandwagon of peer pressure.
[00:38:17.458 --> 00:38:35.570]  Just like we couldn't vote for him, just like he couldn't win, all that rigged, when Obama committed all those crimes, Hillary committed all those crimes, Loretta Lynch on the airplane with Bill Clinton, opening the borders, selling us out, creating ISIS, funding the Muslim Brotherhood to take over our allies, all the war crimes, aiding and abetting radical orthodox Islam that Obama's been involved in.
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:48.827]  If you sit there, and if you go along with that, you have signed on to a system just as evil as the Nazis, or the Soviets, and probably even more evil.
[00:38:50.568 --> 00:38:51.049]  Bottom line.
[00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:54.191]  I'm gonna warn the so-called leftists in people.
[00:38:55.052 --> 00:38:58.254]  The type that'll drive by if I'm downtown and go, F you Alex Jones.
[00:38:59.795 --> 00:39:04.599]  Or the type 60 feet away will see me doing a live feed and go, oh you traitor, you work for the Russians.
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:06.941]  You walk over, show me proof I do.
[00:39:07.441 --> 00:39:08.102]  Ah, shut up.
[00:39:10.438 --> 00:39:11.019]  You fools!
[00:39:14.043 --> 00:39:26.839]  The mainstream media that has funded all the lies and all the horrible things that put Obamacare on you, that has done all this terrible stuff, you sit there and you look at me and my audience and you sit there with your chest sticking out and you call us a traitor.
[00:39:28.672 --> 00:39:40.176]  One is for the Democratic Party with the Russians in the old days and the Communist Chinese and the Democratic Party transferring our power to NAFTA and GATT and the TPP and all the rest of it, along with the Republican traders.
[00:39:41.396 --> 00:39:43.537]  And they're the ones putting us under multinational control.
[00:39:43.797 --> 00:39:45.177]  They're the ones selling us out.
[00:39:45.497 --> 00:39:48.138]  They're the ones telling Africans they can't have cars or air conditioning.
[00:39:49.498 --> 00:39:54.160]  They're the ones telling people in Latin America communism's good when Obama goes down and gives a speech last year.
[00:39:55.606 --> 00:40:00.450]  They're the ones legalizing communism in the government in California last week, while saying it doesn't exist.
[00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:03.252]  They're the ones trying to shut down the independent press in America.
[00:40:03.472 --> 00:40:05.394]  They're the ones saying they want to kill Donald Trump.
[00:40:05.754 --> 00:40:08.536]  They're the ones, they're the clear and present danger.
[00:40:08.817 --> 00:40:16.643]  And you're the little collaborator idiots that during the process of the takeover, get a paycheck or a job or welfare, so you've lied to yourself about it.
[00:40:16.803 --> 00:40:18.924]  If you're going to get money from the system, that's one thing.
[00:40:19.104 --> 00:40:25.566]  But don't be a chump and tell yourself that this isn't leading towards total collapse like we're seeing in Venezuela right now.
[00:40:26.307 --> 00:40:27.127]  Don't be an idiot.
[00:40:27.327 --> 00:40:30.048]  At least have an exit plan before the collapse, you fool.
[00:40:30.388 --> 00:40:34.190]  Because the billionaires have already basically evacuated the U.S.
[00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:37.051]  and they've hardened every facility they live in.
[00:40:38.001 --> 00:40:39.703]  With the highest level security.
[00:40:39.723 --> 00:40:45.729]  20 foot walls, machine gun nest, underground bunkers that go to houses a block away.
[00:40:46.029 --> 00:40:46.830]  Oh yeah, Zuckerberg.
[00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:48.992]  I've talked to folks that designed it out in California.
[00:40:49.552 --> 00:40:51.734]  He bought the houses for two blocks around him.
[00:40:52.675 --> 00:40:53.977]  And he's building a big wall around it.
[00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:56.721]  And the word is they tunneled in there for a year.
[00:40:56.781 --> 00:40:59.843]  He's got tunnels to escape out to helicopter pads.
[00:41:00.264 --> 00:41:08.810]  So it just looks like he's there in the neighborhood, he puts a wall up around it, and he's got a helicopter pad down the street that's in a facility where the roof comes off of it.
[00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:16.014]  The roof opens up like a supervillain and Zuckerberg goes flying off to a jet pad and flies to Kauai.
[00:41:16.034 --> 00:41:19.777]  And all the rest of them got bases in Tasmania.
[00:41:20.117 --> 00:41:22.339]  These guys are James Bond villains.
[00:41:25.953 --> 00:41:27.053]  And here comes Donald Trump.
[00:41:31.114 --> 00:41:32.754]  And he says, I'm going to turn the coal back on.
[00:41:32.774 --> 00:41:33.975]  I'm going to turn the jobs back on.
[00:41:34.295 --> 00:41:38.216]  I'm going to do two-way deals where we actually make money and other people do.
[00:41:38.256 --> 00:41:39.676]  And we're going to do the basic stuff.
[00:41:39.696 --> 00:41:40.456]  We're going to do free market.
[00:41:40.476 --> 00:41:41.476]  We're not killing free market.
[00:41:41.636 --> 00:41:42.596]  And they go, you're crazy.
[00:41:42.616 --> 00:41:49.378]  We have a globalism plan where we consolidate the wealth, pick the winners and losers, and totally take over and hoard the technology for ourselves.
[00:41:49.698 --> 00:41:52.518]  Work with us, Trump, and we'll let your family have life extension.
[00:41:52.979 --> 00:41:54.939]  And Trump said in the meetings,
[00:41:56.479 --> 00:41:58.100]  We're going to release those secrets to the public.
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:00.401]  Those will be disruptive.
[00:42:00.461 --> 00:42:02.061]  He goes, I don't care, we're going to release them.
[00:42:02.381 --> 00:42:03.922]  That's why they're racing to kill him.
[00:42:04.262 --> 00:42:14.266]  Because as soon as he turns the economy back on, as soon as he goes and makes deals and shuts off the terrorism in Saudi Arabia, as soon as he's done that, they're going to start rolling out the advanced technologies to the public.
[00:42:14.526 --> 00:42:16.347]  And they're going to kill him before he does that.
[00:42:16.867 --> 00:42:17.907]  You want the cancer cures?
[00:42:18.508 --> 00:42:19.168]  Stand by Trump.
[00:42:19.568 --> 00:42:20.949]  You want the new free energy systems?
[00:42:21.069 --> 00:42:21.669]  Stand by Trump.
[00:42:23.544 --> 00:42:24.546]  He's for total innovation.
[00:42:24.726 --> 00:42:26.870]  He's for old tech, new tech, advanced tech.
[00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:31.077]  You're about to get it all if you just get out of the way, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:33.715 --> 00:42:36.497]  But to do that, you're going to have to admit you've been brainwashed.
[00:42:36.577 --> 00:42:42.741]  I'm talking, speaking directly to all the so-called pseudo-intellectuals who don't know what COG is and don't know what any of this is.
[00:42:43.001 --> 00:43:03.595]  Hey, so-called liberals, go listen to me 20 years ago talking about it, or right when Trump got elected, on the day he got elected, saying they're going to use COG to undermine him, demonize him, say he's a foreign agent, try to convince him that he's broken a law or obstructed justice with the FBI, because they always trick you in ways to do that, and then they're going to kill him.
[00:43:06.376 --> 00:43:10.078]  Do you watching Stephen Colbert come up with stuff like that?
[00:43:12.779 --> 00:43:20.602]  No, you're a pseudo-intellectual who's been conned and who has convinced themselves that they really know what's going on when you don't know anything.
[00:43:23.023 --> 00:43:30.847]  Would you like it if I spoke in a British accent to you and talked about liberalism perhaps and
[00:43:33.001 --> 00:43:38.326]  The danger of the arrogance of Trump and his naivety and how smart you are for hating Trump.
[00:43:39.387 --> 00:43:42.831]  Perhaps if I spoke in an NPR voice, would it be better?
[00:43:42.871 --> 00:43:47.815]  Would it be more soothing to you instead of just being real, desperately up here, a watcher on the wall?
[00:43:48.516 --> 00:44:05.644]  That we're being overrun by tyranny, losing all our checks and balances, and the President is under a psychological warfare operation, an information war by Deep State, openly declaring war, putting out lie after twisted lie, after half-truth, after regurgitated old frauds.
[00:44:07.224 --> 00:44:14.068]  He talked about laptop bombs two months after it was in the news, and said, we want to work with the Russians to help stop this.
[00:44:14.868 --> 00:44:16.949]  And how excited he was to be going to the Middle East,
[00:44:17.808 --> 00:44:31.701]  And to be working with Israel about a real peace deal with Saudi Arabia, Iran and others to actually shut down the terrorists and make a deal with Saudi Arabia that we wouldn't overproduce oil and actually let them have a future if they stop the terrorist attacks.
[00:44:32.682 --> 00:44:38.887]  And ending the whole Arab Spring that George Soros and Al Gore and Obama and Hillary admittedly started.
[00:44:39.107 --> 00:44:42.871]  Remember Anderson Cooper on TV praising Libya, praising Syria, praising
[00:44:45.006 --> 00:44:49.128]  Egypt overthrowing our allies and murdering hundreds of thousands of Christians?
[00:44:49.489 --> 00:44:50.429]  That's the crimes!
[00:44:50.729 --> 00:44:59.594]  Not if at dinner Trump said, reportedly with no proof, but even if he did, hope you can see it through in your case and your research that he doesn't get in trouble for this because I think he's a great guy.
[00:44:59.614 --> 00:45:00.415]  I don't think he did anything wrong.
[00:45:01.675 --> 00:45:04.257]  He didn't say, I order you as the president to drop this.
[00:45:04.557 --> 00:45:05.697]  That'd be obstruction of justice.
[00:45:08.579 --> 00:45:13.582]  He said, according to the transcript that Comey went and wrote down in the bathroom, hope you can see it through.
[00:45:14.673 --> 00:45:17.156]  You know, if he's done anything wrong here, I hope this gets dropped.
[00:45:19.978 --> 00:45:21.780]  And then, oh my gosh, he's such a criminal.
[00:45:22.261 --> 00:45:24.923]  When you look at everything else the globalists have done, he's the president.
[00:45:25.103 --> 00:45:26.325]  This is a constitutional crisis.
[00:45:26.545 --> 00:45:33.272]  We're going to let the corrupt Democrats and corrupt Republicans in Congress, against Trump and the Tea Party, sit there and hijack the government through intimidation?
[00:45:33.432 --> 00:45:34.453]  Because listen to me carefully.
[00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:38.812]  It's never going to end if that's the case.
[00:45:39.752 --> 00:45:41.013]  They're never going to stop there.
[00:45:41.033 --> 00:45:47.236]  They've said in their own announcements they're going to remove the members of the House that got elected and the Senate, saying that's all a fraud.
[00:45:47.796 --> 00:45:54.720]  Hold new elections run by Homeland Security that Obama put in place with his last executive order before he left office in January of this year.
[00:45:56.781 --> 00:46:00.163]  Think about that long and hard as we're 120 days in right now or so.
[00:46:02.110 --> 00:46:03.812]  And they say the state houses were run by the Russians.
[00:46:04.192 --> 00:46:05.593]  And they say the French election was run.
[00:46:05.913 --> 00:46:08.756]  Oh, but the Russians weren't all powerful there, so Le Pen lost.
[00:46:09.216 --> 00:46:10.337]  And the Russians run everything!
[00:46:10.638 --> 00:46:12.679]  If the Austrians don't want open borders, it's the Russians.
[00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:16.403]  If the Austrians and Germans don't want to commit cultural suicide, it's the Russians!
[00:46:16.723 --> 00:46:17.323]  The Russians!
[00:46:17.364 --> 00:46:17.944]  The Russians!
[00:46:20.226 --> 00:46:25.491]  So the deep state is going to openly come out in the open, shut down the independent press, consolidate the markets,
[00:46:27.802 --> 00:46:53.511]  And remove the patriots all over the United States from the state houses and the local city governments, you name it, with giant armies of Soros-funded, strong cities initiative, UN-backed, social justice warrior, political activist, Chicago organizer types, just descending on everyone in a giant UN globalist reconstruction of America.
[00:46:54.833 --> 00:47:00.238]  A Marshall Plan for America to finally kick out the scourge of racist nationalism.
[00:47:00.538 --> 00:47:06.523]  That's the open plan is literal re-education of the United States.
[00:47:12.023 --> 00:47:32.996]  Led by a bunch of weird, crazy collaborators like Dana Bash and Chuckie Schumer and all the rest of them with just wild-eyed, Joker-level villain faces on, leering that they've got so much power and are out there intimidating everyone, running wild with classical megalomania, while Trump just sits there like a bull-headed stalwart.
[00:47:34.434 --> 00:47:51.424]  His whole life, they admit in the Washington Post, is about standing up to bullies and not being pushed around, just refusing to waver as his administration, like cowards, urinate all over themselves in fear, rolling over with their yellow bellies, begging to submit and begging him to submit to cultural destruction.
[00:47:52.304 --> 00:47:53.505]  And Trump's bet on you.
[00:47:53.785 --> 00:47:54.506]  He's bet on me.
[00:47:54.606 --> 00:47:56.747]  He believes you want freedom.
[00:47:56.767 --> 00:47:58.028]  He believes you'll stand with him.
[00:47:58.528 --> 00:47:59.368]  We need to pray for Trump.
[00:47:59.729 --> 00:48:00.689]  We need to pray for Infowars.
[00:48:00.709 --> 00:48:01.630]  We need to pray for this country.
[00:48:02.441 --> 00:48:08.443]  We need to go to the state houses, go to the Congress, go to the events, go to the rallies, get in their faces.
[00:48:08.543 --> 00:48:09.644]  Call C-SPAN every day.
[00:48:09.924 --> 00:48:11.044]  Call local NPR.
[00:48:11.364 --> 00:48:12.085]  Get involved.
[00:48:12.325 --> 00:48:13.065]  Go to NPR.
[00:48:13.105 --> 00:48:13.825]  Give them materials.
[00:48:13.865 --> 00:48:14.505]  Give them info.
[00:48:14.786 --> 00:48:16.146]  Educate every liberal you can.
[00:48:16.446 --> 00:48:17.927]  Get aggressive about this.
[00:48:20.868 --> 00:48:27.850]  And run for office at every level so you can inject truthful ideas and history.
[00:48:28.070 --> 00:48:31.532]  And if you're a wealthy person who sat on the sidelines,
[00:48:32.529 --> 00:48:34.830]  And keeps hoping, you know, we can just fix things peacefully.
[00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:37.492]  We can fix it if you get involved now.
[00:48:39.032 --> 00:48:48.897]  If you start a show, or if you support this broadcast, or if you put up billboards, or if you call into talk radio, or if you get involved.
[00:48:48.997 --> 00:48:54.760]  Whatever you do, it's an information total war, and they're targeting the main people that have been fighting back.
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:56.021]  They think they can knock us out.
[00:48:57.028 --> 00:48:58.929]  And then send a message to everybody else to roll over.
[00:48:58.949 --> 00:49:01.991]  Because the Megyn Kellys and the Glenn Becks rolled over a long time ago.
[00:49:02.011 --> 00:49:02.831]  They're just mercenaries.
[00:49:03.732 --> 00:49:06.593]  O'Reilly wasn't perfect, but at least he didn't hate America, so they got rid of him.
[00:49:06.833 --> 00:49:07.574]  Now it's Limbaugh.
[00:49:08.314 --> 00:49:09.495]  Then it's going to be everybody else.
[00:49:09.715 --> 00:49:11.055]  And of course, who do they want number one?
[00:49:11.536 --> 00:49:12.056]  After Trump?
[00:49:12.396 --> 00:49:13.036]  InfoWars.
[00:49:13.737 --> 00:49:15.358]  And then they're going to get Drudge after that.
[00:49:15.598 --> 00:49:17.279]  They're going to get everybody.
[00:49:21.661 --> 00:49:23.042]  So let's go ahead and go to Dana Bash.
[00:49:24.457 --> 00:49:28.365]  Admits in a memo is deep state revenge against Trump.
[00:49:28.386 --> 00:49:30.330]  Yeah, and of course, Chuckie Schumer's bragged about this as well.
[00:49:30.731 --> 00:49:33.557]  This is the threats of anti-American scum.
[00:49:33.597 --> 00:49:33.937]  Here it is.
[00:49:34.741 --> 00:49:44.108]  This president has done in his first hundred plus days, even before he came into office, is pick fights with the intelligence community and now the law enforcement community.
[00:49:44.629 --> 00:49:54.257]  Particularly the way, never mind that he fired James Comey, but the way in which he did it, not giving him the respect of actually telling him in person or at least not having him find out from cable news.
[00:49:56.318 --> 00:49:59.523]  We know that this is, you know, they talk about the deep state.
[00:49:59.543 --> 00:50:08.194]  Well, these are communities that have a lot of loyalty within and know how to get back, even if you're the President of the United States.
[00:50:10.237 --> 00:50:12.999]  Even if you're the president, you gotta learn you're gonna pay.
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:24.869]  This is the unaccountable, out of control, deep state bureaucracy that does whatever it wants, is bankrupting this country, opening us up for third world colonization and then brainwashing the third world colonists to hate America.
[00:50:25.290 --> 00:50:33.036]  This is a total cultural takeover of people openly at war with the family, all over Salon and all over the news promoting pedophilia.
[00:50:34.037 --> 00:50:37.180]  The literal scum of the earth
[00:50:39.335 --> 00:50:43.596]  Letting Trump know, yeah, this is the deep state, we're going to keep leaking fake garbage, on and on and on.
[00:50:43.836 --> 00:50:46.117]  What does Trump do to strike back?
[00:50:47.057 --> 00:50:51.879]  Well, Colonel Schaefer says he has to realize he's in a total war, they're never going to stop, and he's got to get aggressive.
[00:50:52.139 --> 00:50:55.240]  Well, what does he do constitutionally to avert this civil war?
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:56.940]  I think pretty much anything now.
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:57.881]  You understand that?
[00:51:01.322 --> 00:51:03.562]  Imagine the world without InfoWars.
[00:51:03.602 --> 00:51:07.343]  The globalists have already consolidated their ballot.
[00:51:09.457 --> 00:51:13.138]  They don't want people to have their own economies, their own choices.
[00:51:13.838 --> 00:51:27.161]  When you spread the links to Infowars.com news stories and our videos, when you tell friends, family, and neighbors about our free iPhone and Droid apps, or send them a link to our daily podcast, you are involved in a revolutionary act against tyranny.
[00:51:27.581 --> 00:51:32.783]  It was George Orwell that said, in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[00:51:33.523 --> 00:51:37.344]  That's why I spend a lot of time trying to not just innovate,
[00:51:38.645 --> 00:51:44.749]  News and analysis and our fight against the globalists, but also thinking about how we're able to fund our operation.
[00:51:45.009 --> 00:51:47.832]  That's so critical to prosecute an information war.
[00:51:48.752 --> 00:52:03.684]  And I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic and high quality.
[00:52:04.124 --> 00:52:06.246]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we have private labeled it.
[00:52:07.589 --> 00:52:19.937]  And it is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emrix Essentials, and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from InfoWareStore.com.
[00:52:20.757 --> 00:52:29.402]  On top of that, if you sign up for AutoShip, you get an additional, out of the gates, 25% off on this product.
[00:52:29.983 --> 00:52:35.066]  Emrix Essentials is all about personal care, hygiene, not getting skin cancer.
[00:52:35.626 --> 00:52:39.290]  Not getting bit by a bunch of bugs and gnats and mosquitoes.
[00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:40.772]  It's all there.
[00:52:40.932 --> 00:52:44.976]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash.
[00:52:45.456 --> 00:52:47.559]  All of it is truly game-changing.
[00:52:48.039 --> 00:52:48.840]  Be-A-Way spray.
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:51.142]  Totally organic, essential oils.
[00:52:51.883 --> 00:52:55.425]  Works a lot better than the toxic chemical systems that are out there.
[00:52:55.806 --> 00:52:58.087]  And it is comparable in price.
[00:52:58.387 --> 00:52:59.828]  And again, it's concentrated.
[00:53:00.149 --> 00:53:01.570]  The deodorant is amazing.
[00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:02.710]  High quality.
[00:53:03.391 --> 00:53:04.932]  Doesn't have the aluminum garbage in it.
[00:53:05.232 --> 00:53:05.972]  Totally natural.
[00:53:06.233 --> 00:53:06.733]  Works great.
[00:53:07.654 --> 00:53:10.495]  SPF 30 face and body lotion sunscreen.
[00:53:10.896 --> 00:53:11.416]  Unscented.
[00:53:11.976 --> 00:53:12.937]  This is exciting.
[00:53:13.037 --> 00:53:16.680]  Because so many of the so-called sunscreens that are out there are toxic.
[00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:19.181]  As everyone knows, I'm obsessed with Win-Wins.
[00:53:19.201 --> 00:53:19.842]  20% off what it is retail.
[00:53:22.363 --> 00:53:23.524]  Because we cut out the middleman.
[00:53:24.304 --> 00:53:26.985]  And then, additionally, we signed up for auto-ship out of the gates.
[00:53:27.005 --> 00:53:28.766]  25% off that.
[00:53:29.226 --> 00:53:31.247]  Because I want you to try these products.
[00:53:31.387 --> 00:53:32.627]  I want you to love these products.
[00:53:32.967 --> 00:53:43.592]  I want to have a deeper relationship with you in a 360 win, a non-zero-sum game, where you get high quality, you get value, and you repeat order something you need every month.
[00:53:44.472 --> 00:53:52.099]  And then we're able to secure our funding into the future to not just stay at the level we're at, but to grow in the face of enemy attacks.
[00:53:52.379 --> 00:53:57.003]  InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, and you'll find Emmerich's Essentials.
[00:54:19.013 --> 00:54:22.294]  Bring me in.
[00:54:22.414 --> 00:54:30.716]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've got intel here that I've not been allowed to tell you, but there is a civil war going on in the government right now.
[00:54:31.677 --> 00:54:33.237]  Even having commercials right now.
[00:54:33.937 --> 00:54:36.938]  You know when we have a new Iraq war for like a week, they don't have ads on radio?
[00:54:37.338 --> 00:54:40.579]  Or when 9-11 happened for about a week, there were no ads on radio?
[00:54:43.078 --> 00:54:46.562]  I don't have words to describe to you how much trouble this country's in.
[00:54:47.823 --> 00:54:51.106]  The Democratic Party has been working for the Communist Chinese for at least 20 years.
[00:54:52.027 --> 00:54:55.511]  Because see, once they took money from the Chinese, they all got compromised.
[00:54:57.473 --> 00:55:04.100]  And now a lot of the Republican leaders are working for them, and I have a lot of intel I'm not allowed to share with you.
[00:55:08.109 --> 00:55:09.329]  That's directly from the President.
[00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:20.792]  And he just, he will not, just like Assange won't release sources because that's the cardinal rule, even though Seth was one of his sources.
[00:55:25.613 --> 00:55:26.653]  It's the same thing with the President.
[00:55:26.693 --> 00:55:28.814]  He won't release classified information.
[00:55:30.245 --> 00:55:31.786]  Even though it defends everything he's doing.
[00:55:32.667 --> 00:55:34.808]  And everybody's trying to figure out how to do this right now.
[00:55:34.868 --> 00:55:36.129]  And I just, I'm going to say it right now.
[00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:39.652]  You get Oberman saying, release your leaks now.
[00:55:39.772 --> 00:55:40.592]  Existential threat.
[00:55:40.973 --> 00:55:42.293]  Russia, release your info on Trump.
[00:55:42.373 --> 00:55:43.094]  It's the other way around.
[00:55:43.975 --> 00:55:45.996]  All the agencies, the news media, everybody.
[00:55:46.036 --> 00:55:49.999]  There's no future if you don't release what NBC, CBS, all of them are doing.
[00:55:51.630 --> 00:56:01.298]  Everybody inside government, everybody inside these corporations, has to start releasing the crimes, the lies, the frame-ups, or we're going to go into a civil war.
[00:56:03.741 --> 00:56:05.302]  The globalists are going to lose this.
[00:56:06.883 --> 00:56:08.184]  They were going to lose the election.
[00:56:08.525 --> 00:56:10.226]  Trump had like 65% support.
[00:56:10.446 --> 00:56:11.948]  They had fake polls, I told you that.
[00:56:12.368 --> 00:56:14.210]  The CIA and FBI people know
[00:56:16.109 --> 00:56:20.211]  That the globalists are going to lose this civil war, but it might kick a nuclear war off in the middle of it.
[00:56:20.231 --> 00:56:21.572]  They're crazy people.
[00:56:22.272 --> 00:56:23.453]  It's like the German High Command.
[00:56:23.493 --> 00:56:27.856]  They weren't good guys, but they tried to kill Hitler in 1944 because they knew he was going to destroy Germany.
[00:56:29.757 --> 00:56:31.037]  Well, it's the same thing with globalism.
[00:56:31.798 --> 00:56:32.498]  It's horrible.
[00:56:32.558 --> 00:56:33.359]  You don't want it.
[00:56:33.659 --> 00:56:34.479]  It doesn't work.
[00:56:34.759 --> 00:56:38.301]  It doesn't work for the rich people, because it ends up imploding everything.
[00:56:38.622 --> 00:56:42.624]  But they're so selfish, they want to make everybody else poor, so they've got all the power.
[00:56:46.243 --> 00:56:50.727]  And I, in the last week, have been privy to a lot of the stuff going on in the White House.
[00:56:51.247 --> 00:56:56.192]  And, obviously, as things get more desperate, they realize how right I was, and I get even more intel.
[00:56:57.212 --> 00:57:00.075]  And I have information from a bunch of different sources in the White House.
[00:57:00.275 --> 00:57:07.221]  And then I've got to ask them, why am I even being told this?
[00:57:07.241 --> 00:57:08.142]  Because I'm not allowed to tell people.
[00:57:10.223 --> 00:57:12.866]  But I'll just tell you this, the Communist Chinese are the enemy.
[00:57:14.082 --> 00:57:21.170]  And Trump tried to make side deals with them to stop being so belligerent and out of control and to stop manipulating our internal politics.
[00:57:21.911 --> 00:57:27.377]  They just basically walked away from it like the Chinese communists do and said, oh yeah, sure we will, but then ignored it.
[00:57:30.427 --> 00:57:31.267]  And now you've got everybody.
[00:57:31.307 --> 00:57:36.090]  The Deep State goes to war with President-elect using unverified claims as Democrats cheer.
[00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:38.371]  That's Glenn Greenwald, a real liberal, at the intercept.
[00:57:38.791 --> 00:57:39.931]  I've told you that for months.
[00:57:39.991 --> 00:57:52.557]  The Deep State is at war with Trump and we've got Colonel Schaefer coming up saying it's an information war and the President has to realize they're not going to give him any quarter and it's time.
[00:57:52.877 --> 00:57:53.958]  You think he committed a crime?
[00:57:54.338 --> 00:57:56.079]  How about all the crimes of Obama and Hillary?
[00:57:56.359 --> 00:57:56.859]  Sessions!
[00:57:57.439 --> 00:57:58.440]  Move against everybody!
[00:57:59.887 --> 00:58:03.710]  America is being taken over by foreign powers right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:12.156]  And so under the Constitution, the President can do anything to anyone who is an admitted officer of that globalist corporate takeover.
[00:58:12.376 --> 00:58:13.857]  This is 21st century war.
[00:58:14.117 --> 00:58:21.523]  We're going to lose the whole country to a bunch of bloodthirsty communists and pedophiles if we don't back the President!
[00:58:22.203 --> 00:58:21.523]  100%!
[00:58:22.263 --> 00:58:27.487]  And it's just like the weathermen.
[00:58:28.729 --> 00:58:35.633]  I told the FBI in the hearings that came out in the 70s, they always plan to use the Communist Chinese to take over America, but they thought it'd be physical.
[00:58:35.973 --> 00:58:39.796]  They said it's economic, and then a bunch of collaborators in the government go along with it.
[00:58:39.936 --> 00:58:40.916]  God Almighty!
[00:58:41.817 --> 00:58:43.418]  If people just knew!
[00:58:43.498 --> 00:58:44.759]  It's so obvious!
[00:58:44.839 --> 00:58:48.861]  Chuckie, Schumer, Hillary, they're all literal foreign agents!
[00:58:50.802 --> 00:58:54.865]  This is the InfoWars power pack, and it can start your car if it has a dead battery.
[00:58:56.735 --> 00:58:59.416]  And now we're going to use the Power Pack to jumpstart this truck.
[00:58:59.836 --> 00:59:00.817]  And we're going to show you!
[00:59:01.237 --> 00:59:02.517]  Switch on the Power Pack.
[00:59:03.177 --> 00:59:06.019]  Wait a few minutes, and then you'll be able to start your car.
[00:59:06.739 --> 00:59:11.921]  With just a few minutes on the Infowars Battery Pack, you go from a dead battery to this.
[00:59:18.502 --> 00:59:21.265]  You get all that cranking power in this little brick!
[00:59:21.545 --> 00:59:27.510]  The Infowars Power Pack is a must-have, and it'll give you peace of mind whether you're at home or on the go.
[00:59:28.131 --> 00:59:33.536]  It's so compact, it'll fit in your backpack, your glove box, or even your back pocket.
[00:59:33.936 --> 00:59:38.721]  Get one for your home, boat, car, camping setup, or just for emergencies.
[00:59:39.221 --> 00:59:49.511]  Secure your peace of mind today and order your Info Wars Power Pack from InfoWarsStore.com or dial 1-888-253-3139 and order today!
[00:59:52.935 --> 00:59:58.841]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:17.377]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[01:00:17.937 --> 01:00:20.738]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:23.539 --> 01:00:28.341]  Something happened about four months ago at the Davos Forum, when the president had just been sworn in.
[01:00:29.542 --> 01:00:31.122]  The communist Chinese president was there.
[01:00:31.142 --> 01:00:34.904]  He said, don't worry, we'll help defeat American populism.
[01:00:35.874 --> 01:00:38.375]  We'll help the EU defeat it also in Europe.
[01:00:38.415 --> 01:00:41.536]  We'll help give money and we'll also give expertise on censorship.
[01:00:42.197 --> 01:00:47.379]  And then Computer Weekly and all these other publications came out and said, oh, China's right about censoring right-wingers.
[01:00:47.859 --> 01:00:49.360]  Look at the great system they have in China.
[01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:50.960]  Yeah, they kill Buddhists and sell their organs.
[01:00:51.901 --> 01:00:53.682]  I mean, you're reading this, not believing it.
[01:00:57.383 --> 01:01:03.846]  And then you realize the Communist Chinese with a billion three hundred million slaves are coordinating with the Democratic Party
[01:01:05.523 --> 01:01:09.325]  Publicly on how to shut down Trump and InfoWars and you.
[01:01:11.887 --> 01:01:14.028]  And then you ask liberals, you go, hey, why don't you help us?
[01:01:14.048 --> 01:01:15.089]  They go, shut up, traitor!
[01:01:15.409 --> 01:01:16.290]  You're a Russian agent.
[01:01:16.550 --> 01:01:18.812]  See, because Russia is under global attack as well.
[01:01:19.052 --> 01:01:20.092]  Russia isn't doing anything.
[01:01:22.074 --> 01:01:22.514]  It's a fact.
[01:01:27.477 --> 01:01:31.460]  And then I know people that will end up starting to bash Russia just to get the media off their back.
[01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:34.181]  And they go, I know it's not true, but we kind of got to play along with this.
[01:01:34.201 --> 01:01:35.042]  I'm not playing along with any of it.
[01:01:39.778 --> 01:01:41.680]  I got a Colonel Schaefer clip I'm gonna play right now.
[01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:43.901]  Then a Dana Bash one I'm gonna play again.
[01:01:43.921 --> 01:01:45.442]  And then we got a bunch of guests coming on today.
[01:01:45.482 --> 01:01:50.706]  But Joel Skousen, or his uncle, is like the head of the FBI in one division.
[01:01:51.067 --> 01:01:52.648]  Wrote The Naked Communist, all the rest of it.
[01:01:52.668 --> 01:01:54.129]  He's an expert on what's going on with all this.
[01:01:54.790 --> 01:01:58.192]  But they're making the deep state move on Trump right now because he's trying to restore the republic.
[01:01:58.873 --> 01:01:59.873]  That's why Trump's so angry.
[01:02:00.094 --> 01:02:02.175]  Day 70, he kind of sideways a little bit.
[01:02:02.515 --> 01:02:03.736]  Thinking, okay, I'll compromise.
[01:02:04.717 --> 01:02:06.098]  Something Trump really never even does.
[01:02:06.118 --> 01:02:09.401]  Because they were trying to bring him down, and plus he couldn't get his agenda through.
[01:02:10.205 --> 01:02:13.207]  They took that as weakness, and they upped the ante to try to totally take him out.
[01:02:15.708 --> 01:02:19.970]  See, when Trump never compromised any, he had that aura of invincibility and total support by his backers.
[01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:28.774]  But the globalists knew if they could get him to just do a little bit of sideways stuff, he'd lose his support from us partially, and then he could fall.
[01:02:28.854 --> 01:02:31.956]  And then once he goes down, the whole republic can be brought to its knees.
[01:02:32.996 --> 01:02:34.217]  And the economy will be imploded.
[01:02:35.285 --> 01:02:36.746]  The government will pick the winners and losers.
[01:02:36.786 --> 01:02:39.106]  Most people will line up to do whatever they're told to be part of it.
[01:02:40.447 --> 01:02:41.167]  The rest is history.
[01:02:42.508 --> 01:02:46.849]  America will pass into history and the new dark age of globalism will begin.
[01:02:49.870 --> 01:02:53.952]  Here is Colonel Schaefer breaking down exactly what's happening on Fox News.
[01:02:55.086 --> 01:02:59.667]  The president, for better or for worse, is the ultimate classification or declassification authority.
[01:02:59.867 --> 01:03:03.568]  He can talk to anybody about anything, no matter what the level is.
[01:03:04.508 --> 01:03:12.370]  And beyond that, I understand that things were instantly twisted by the National Security Council staff and leaked, obviously, to the Post.
[01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:20.891]  And there was a very delayed, very muted response, where they should have been right up there, outlining the facts right up front about how this is completely false.
[01:03:21.252 --> 01:03:23.232]  So I think they, like you point out,
[01:03:24.072 --> 01:03:27.776]  The White House communications staff has to believe they are now at a state of war.
[01:03:27.996 --> 01:03:28.617]  This is war.
[01:03:28.957 --> 01:03:31.480]  It's called information operations, information warfare.
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:40.409]  And clearly, the other side, the deep state and the Clinton folks, and I have to say some folks on the Republican side, are all lining up.
[01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:42.411]  The battle lines are drawn.
[01:03:42.851 --> 01:03:46.535]  It's time for people to understand how to deal with this like it's a war.
[01:03:47.416 --> 01:03:52.020]  The Deep State is committed to maintaining this assault, it seems.
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:59.686]  I mean, we're not even four months into the Trump presidency, and the assaults continue, the attacks continue.
[01:03:59.866 --> 01:04:00.407]  Head pause.
[01:04:00.827 --> 01:04:02.368]  I want to play this from the start.
[01:04:02.388 --> 01:04:03.129]  It's a long clip.
[01:04:03.149 --> 01:04:05.711]  When we come back, I'll play it again, and then play the conclusion.
[01:04:06.532 --> 01:04:11.996]  I want to tell the criminals in the Deep State, because there's two different Deep States, probably three or four, but two big ones.
[01:04:13.214 --> 01:04:13.975]  You've been identified.
[01:04:14.035 --> 01:04:15.116]  Globalism is unelected.
[01:04:15.136 --> 01:04:15.817]  It's unaccountable.
[01:04:16.277 --> 01:04:16.998]  It's anti-human.
[01:04:17.038 --> 01:04:17.698]  It's anti-God.
[01:04:17.758 --> 01:04:18.439]  It's anti-Christ.
[01:04:18.479 --> 01:04:19.200]  It's pro-Islam.
[01:04:21.122 --> 01:04:22.623]  You're never going to get away with this.
[01:04:22.763 --> 01:04:27.348]  And, you know, a sick part of me, a Machiavellian part of me, actually hopes they bring down Trump.
[01:04:28.604 --> 01:04:34.011]  Because it's going to be bloody, and it's going to be bad, and it's going to be hard, but it'll ensure our victory, long term.
[01:04:34.551 --> 01:04:44.022]  Because if Trump just kind of stalemates and kind of fixes a few things, but he gets stagnated, then it'll just kind of permeate, and oh, did patriotism fail, did free market fail.
[01:04:44.042 --> 01:04:45.684]  But if you want a real war, a 1776,
[01:04:49.807 --> 01:04:51.370]  I've already done my stuff, tellin' the truth.
[01:04:51.410 --> 01:04:54.094]  I've already set the groundwork and already got the whole info war ready.
[01:04:54.114 --> 01:04:55.376]  I've already got the battle space ready.
[01:04:55.676 --> 01:04:56.557]  I've looked at it real careful.
[01:04:56.597 --> 01:04:58.400]  You guys are gonna lose 90%.
[01:05:00.407 --> 01:05:17.298]  The Clinton body count resurfaces as a very brave private investigator reveals evidence that DNC staffer Seth Rich indeed had contact with WikiLeaks just days before his unsolved murder.
[01:05:17.558 --> 01:05:25.363]  Seth Rich joins a long list of unfortunate murder and suicide victims with close ties to the Clintons.
[01:05:25.703 --> 01:05:27.886]  Meanwhile, the FBI and D.C.
[01:05:27.946 --> 01:05:34.093]  police continue to insist that his death was from a robbery gone bad.
[01:05:34.253 --> 01:05:35.354]  But former D.C.
[01:05:35.394 --> 01:05:40.740]  homicide detective turned private investigator Rod Wheeler says the D.C.
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:43.503]  police were told to stand down.
[01:05:43.703 --> 01:05:45.866]  Actually, I have a source inside the police department.
[01:05:46.306 --> 01:05:53.241]  That has looked at me straight in the eye and said, Rod, we were told to stand down in this case and I can't share any information with you.
[01:05:53.301 --> 01:05:56.328]  And you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.

[01:07:04.676 --> 01:07:06.157]  There is a crisis in America today.
[01:07:06.637 --> 01:07:09.019]  Tens of millions of us are addicted to cell phones.
[01:07:09.339 --> 01:07:16.744]  These little devices, according to many university studies and more, cause health risks such as depression, cancer, and social anxiety.
[01:07:17.144 --> 01:07:20.746]  How can we prevent these harmful devices from harming us and our families?
[01:07:21.086 --> 01:07:22.247]  I have the answer for you today.
[01:07:22.647 --> 01:07:23.788]  It's called the Blocking Pocket.
[01:07:24.554 --> 01:07:29.857]  The Block-It Pocket works by securing your phone in its safe, no-radiation compartment.
[01:07:30.298 --> 01:07:36.061]  I use the Block-It Pocket every day to protect me from harmful radiation and prevent others from stealing my stuff.
[01:07:36.882 --> 01:07:39.344]  Online, your entire persona is visible.
[01:07:39.544 --> 01:07:45.507]  Your credit card numbers, your email, everything about you that a criminal can use to hack and buy things under your name.
[01:07:46.308 --> 01:07:46.708]  Oh, boy.
[01:08:11.664 --> 01:08:16.646]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[01:08:17.207 --> 01:08:19.988]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:21.208 --> 01:08:28.032]  I've been on air 22 years, and I can tell you today, so far, and I'm sure it'll get more intense as we go, is the most important broadcast I've ever done.
[01:08:28.052 --> 01:08:32.754]  You can just see where our country is, the crossroads we've reached.
[01:08:33.820 --> 01:08:45.708]  You can see the globalists working with foreign governments, communist China, the big multinational banks, trying to control our economy, trying to pick winners and losers, trying to make a giant underclass of controlled people that they can manipulate.
[01:08:46.028 --> 01:08:50.050]  They're at war with free market, they're at war with America, they're at war with Americana.
[01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:54.533]  If they can bring Donald John Trump down, they can bring us all down.
[01:08:55.414 --> 01:08:58.876]  Chuckie Schumer admits that it's the intelligence agencies trying to bring down Trump.
[01:08:59.216 --> 01:09:01.678]  Dana Bash says that Deep State is having its revenge.
[01:09:02.677 --> 01:09:10.339]  Tony Schaffer comes out, former CIA and Army, headed up the anti-bin Laden unit, and says, this is information war to bring down the President.
[01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:11.180]  It's all a lie.
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:14.921]  The President must realize it's that and must take offensive action.
[01:09:14.941 --> 01:09:22.463]  The President, as we speak, has been giving a speech for 30 minutes, saying, quote, just minutes ago, he is the most mistreated President in U.S.
[01:09:22.603 --> 01:09:22.983]  history.
[01:09:23.263 --> 01:09:25.184]  He has been the most unfairly treated.
[01:09:27.545 --> 01:09:28.865]  And he's in New London, Connecticut.
[01:09:32.458 --> 01:09:34.579]  Breaking all of that down.
[01:09:35.839 --> 01:09:37.960]  And Trump's saying, I want to bring prosperity back.
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.961]  Three trillion in the stock market, hundreds of billions in jobs.
[01:09:41.641 --> 01:09:42.622]  That's just all I want.
[01:09:42.782 --> 01:09:43.622]  I'm for America.
[01:09:43.642 --> 01:09:44.862]  I'm for America.
[01:09:44.882 --> 01:09:45.943]  I'm for America.
[01:09:45.963 --> 01:09:50.204]  And the globalists are saying, no, you're a traitor.
[01:09:50.444 --> 01:09:50.925]  You're an enemy.
[01:09:50.945 --> 01:09:51.705]  We're going to remove you.
[01:09:53.105 --> 01:10:00.148]  And then when I was out on the streets of Austin two nights ago, people driving by at 20 miles an hour recognized me, but say, yeah, Alex!
[01:10:01.212 --> 01:10:02.853]  Or they'd say, F you, traitor!
[01:10:03.133 --> 01:10:03.913]  F you, Russian!
[01:10:03.933 --> 01:10:06.195]  Or they'd yell, there's the Russian agent!
[01:10:06.555 --> 01:10:07.796]  I'd say, get over here and talk to me!
[01:10:08.256 --> 01:10:09.476]  They'd go, aw, screw you!
[01:10:09.516 --> 01:10:10.897]  I'm not talking to a traitor!
[01:10:12.978 --> 01:10:17.501]  The good news was, though, for every person calling me a traitor, there were three people awake in downtown Austin.
[01:10:18.941 --> 01:10:19.522]  It was surreal.
[01:10:19.562 --> 01:10:21.383]  I was walking back to the hotel where Roger was at.
[01:10:22.605 --> 01:10:26.968]  People are like, listening to me in their earphones, going, hey, I was just listening to you.
[01:10:26.988 --> 01:10:29.650]  And they hold it up, and it was like the earlier broadcast.
[01:10:29.670 --> 01:10:31.011]  It wasn't the live feed I'd just done.
[01:10:31.431 --> 01:10:33.432]  And then the guys bring my car from the hotel.
[01:10:33.452 --> 01:10:34.873]  They're like, we were just listening to you.
[01:10:34.913 --> 01:10:35.654]  We love the show.
[01:10:37.395 --> 01:10:38.836]  One guy was black, one was Hispanic.
[01:10:38.856 --> 01:10:41.318]  So it's just black, Hispanic, white, doesn't matter, old, young.
[01:10:41.818 --> 01:10:42.619]  It's Fight Club.
[01:10:43.159 --> 01:10:44.420]  It's the battle for the republic.
[01:10:45.581 --> 01:10:49.784]  And it's got to really, really shake the globalist up to know so many people have awakened.
[01:10:50.746 --> 01:11:00.836]  So many people now understand that a foreign multinational combine of corporations have taken over our government, they're allied with Communist China, they're allied with this corrupt Pope who's bringing down Catholicism.
[01:11:01.737 --> 01:11:03.679]  Say what you want about Catholicism, this guy's bringing it down.
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:07.482]  All the rest of it, it's just a crazy time to be alive.
[01:11:07.502 --> 01:11:10.565]  And then they look at our guy, who's really delivering.
[01:11:11.434 --> 01:11:12.495]  Killing TPP.
[01:11:12.535 --> 01:11:13.717]  A good Supreme Court Justice.
[01:11:14.278 --> 01:11:15.639]  And they tell us he's a traitor.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.382]  The Russians were planting bugs.
[01:11:17.422 --> 01:11:18.783]  He gave the Russians secret info.
[01:11:19.024 --> 01:11:20.766]  Within hours it comes out it was all fake.
[01:11:20.986 --> 01:11:23.129]  It was the laptop stuff about ISIS and bombs.
[01:11:23.369 --> 01:11:23.850]  And laptops.
[01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:25.232]  That was in the news two months ago.
[01:11:26.476 --> 01:11:27.277]  But they don't care!
[01:11:27.717 --> 01:11:28.238]  Moralize!
[01:11:28.298 --> 01:11:28.758]  Moralize!
[01:11:28.798 --> 01:11:29.179]  Moralize!
[01:11:29.199 --> 01:11:35.866]  Because this bureaucracy and these special interests that are looting the American people have been in power for decades and they're arrogant!
[01:11:36.066 --> 01:11:38.288]  They're like coming home and you've been out of town for three months.
[01:11:38.589 --> 01:11:40.231]  You got a college student, son or daughter.
[01:11:40.271 --> 01:11:40.991]  I've heard these stories.
[01:11:41.692 --> 01:11:43.554]  You come home and your kids are having a party.
[01:11:43.814 --> 01:11:45.136]  The whole house is a filthy mess.
[01:11:46.217 --> 01:11:46.898]  You see some of your
[01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:53.602]  Antiques have been sold, and you find out that your, you know, son or daughter is on cocaine or whatever.
[01:11:53.622 --> 01:11:54.543]  I read about these stories.
[01:11:54.763 --> 01:11:55.463]  Hadn't happened to me.
[01:11:55.943 --> 01:11:56.844]  And you say, what have you done?
[01:11:56.864 --> 01:11:58.804]  They say, oh, dad, I'll do whatever I want!
[01:12:03.466 --> 01:12:04.487]  And they take a swing at you.
[01:12:06.227 --> 01:12:12.130]  And they can't believe it when the cops get there, and they're getting put in the car, that it wasn't their house.
[01:12:12.250 --> 01:12:12.850]  It wasn't theirs.
[01:12:12.910 --> 01:12:13.650]  They stole it.
[01:12:13.931 --> 01:12:14.811]  It wasn't theirs.
[01:12:17.090 --> 01:12:18.871]  And that's exactly what's going on right now.
[01:12:18.911 --> 01:12:20.292]  So let me play this clip of Colonel Schaefer.
[01:12:20.492 --> 01:12:21.852]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:12:22.533 --> 01:12:23.533]  And then I'm getting to the big news.
[01:12:24.634 --> 01:12:26.595]  We've just seen the stock market plunge today.
[01:12:26.615 --> 01:12:28.316]  We're gonna give you the latest here in a moment.
[01:12:28.816 --> 01:12:29.737]  Over 250 points.
[01:12:31.758 --> 01:12:33.058]  Soros could crash U.S.
[01:12:33.098 --> 01:12:35.359]  dollar by pushing Trump impeachment.
[01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:37.781]  This morning at like 8 a.m.
[01:12:37.801 --> 01:12:43.784]  before the stock market even opened, I called Nico and I said, we're gonna go with the headline today of stock market plunging.
[01:12:45.495 --> 01:12:48.677]  As the Globals move against Trump, and of course, that's what started, that's what happened.
[01:12:51.979 --> 01:12:53.360]  It's 252 points down right now.
[01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:54.681]  Jack Welch said that last night.
[01:12:54.981 --> 01:12:56.242]  Just like clockwork, it happened.
[01:13:01.085 --> 01:13:04.588]  Jack Welch, though, said that it was amateur that Trump fired the FBI director.
[01:13:05.108 --> 01:13:09.371]  What are you supposed to do when the guy says you're crazy because you were being wiretapped when you weren't?
[01:13:11.738 --> 01:13:13.079]  Trump says he's being wiretapped.
[01:13:13.559 --> 01:13:14.359]  He says he's crazy.
[01:13:14.399 --> 01:13:14.839]  He wasn't.
[01:13:15.039 --> 01:13:15.940]  He was being wiretapped.
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:16.940]  They admitted all that.
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:19.081]  That's the level we've gotten to here.
[01:13:19.421 --> 01:13:21.222]  Trump has to move against these people.
[01:13:21.422 --> 01:13:26.544]  And I know high-level folks are advising Trump to get rid of this whole nest of leakers he's got.
[01:13:26.844 --> 01:13:27.705]  Go on the offense.
[01:13:27.785 --> 01:13:28.605]  Indict Hillary.
[01:13:28.985 --> 01:13:29.946]  You've got her cut and dry.
[01:13:29.986 --> 01:13:30.886]  Go after Obama.
[01:13:31.546 --> 01:13:32.267]  They want to fight.
[01:13:32.307 --> 01:13:33.047]  They're about to get one.
[01:13:33.067 --> 01:13:35.408]  Because if we don't, they're not going to give us quarter.
[01:13:35.448 --> 01:13:36.428]  They don't want to make a deal.
[01:13:36.628 --> 01:13:37.729]  They don't want to compromise.
[01:13:37.949 --> 01:13:39.530]  The globalists want to win.
[01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:43.379]  Because they know the people all over the world are turning against him.
[01:13:43.781 --> 01:13:45.947]  Here is Colonel Schaefer breaking down the InfoWar.
[01:13:48.039 --> 01:13:51.401]  For better or for worse, he's the ultimate classification or declassification authority.
[01:13:51.601 --> 01:13:55.323]  He can talk to anybody about anything, no matter what the level is.
[01:13:56.243 --> 01:14:04.107]  And beyond that, I understand that things were instantly twisted by the National Security Council staff and leaked, obviously, to the Post.
[01:14:04.688 --> 01:14:12.652]  And there was a very delayed, very muted response, where they should have been right up there, outlining the facts right up front about how this is completely false.
[01:14:12.992 --> 01:14:14.973]  So I think they, like you point out,
[01:14:15.813 --> 01:14:19.535]  The White House communications staff has to believe they are now at a state of war.
[01:14:19.735 --> 01:14:20.355]  This is war.
[01:14:20.696 --> 01:14:23.217]  It's called information operations, information warfare.
[01:14:23.577 --> 01:14:32.141]  And clearly, the other side, the deep state and the Clinton folks, and I have to say some folks on the Republican side, are all lining up.
[01:14:33.081 --> 01:14:34.322]  The battle lines are drawn.
[01:14:34.402 --> 01:14:38.264]  It's time for people to understand how to deal with this like it's a war.
[01:14:39.144 --> 01:14:43.748]  The deep state is committed to maintaining this assault, it seems.
[01:14:43.828 --> 01:14:54.516]  I mean, we're not even four months into the Trump presidency, and the assaults continue, the attacks continue, and we have, as you indicated, the onset.
[01:14:55.536 --> 01:14:59.680]  The New York Times and the Washington Post, these are no longer fake news.
[01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:03.544]  I mean, they are, it's an entire psyops.
[01:15:03.564 --> 01:15:09.589]  It is a disinformation campaign from previous, you know, former journalists.
[01:15:10.650 --> 01:15:16.996]  What do you think, having some experience with all of the above, would be an appropriate response by this White House?
[01:15:17.236 --> 01:15:17.917]  Well, two things.
[01:15:17.977 --> 01:15:20.399]  First, you're completely correct on the papers.
[01:15:20.459 --> 01:15:24.182]  I mean, they've become Pravda, just to use a Cold War metaphor.
[01:15:25.182 --> 01:15:25.983]  It's shameful.
[01:15:26.463 --> 01:15:34.450]  Secondly, regarding the very fact, and look, I've met with senior intelligence officials now in place, and Lou, they have to go through and sort out
[01:15:34.930 --> 01:15:39.772]  Who is going to be actual career people who are going to do their job and those who are loyal to the previous administration.
[01:15:40.212 --> 01:15:44.714]  And some of these folks have transitioned from what we call political appointee jobs into career jobs.
[01:15:45.074 --> 01:15:51.697]  So you got to go through, so my recommendation, I'll tell you what I said, you need to go fire two people, two levels down.
[01:15:51.777 --> 01:15:54.318]  Everybody below you two levels, fire them.
[01:15:54.538 --> 01:15:55.218]  Be done with it.
[01:15:55.658 --> 01:15:57.059]  Thank you for your service to America.
[01:15:57.099 --> 01:16:04.342]  It's time for you to find a new job and then start looking for people who are going to be loyal to the American people and to the policies of this president.
[01:16:04.542 --> 01:16:05.463]  That's what you've got to do.
[01:16:05.543 --> 01:16:06.384]  It's just that simple.
[01:16:08.265 --> 01:16:16.612]  I've got breaking news at the bottom of the hour, but I've got to check some of this, not for validity, but to see how much I can release from what's happening in the White House.
[01:16:17.893 --> 01:16:23.177]  But I've been told by White House sources to go ahead and go with this information.
[01:16:23.498 --> 01:16:25.900]  But there's a total civil war going on in the government right now.
[01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:29.643]  Criminal elements of the deep state, allied with Communist China particularly,
[01:16:30.737 --> 01:16:32.038]  Know there's a populist awakening.
[01:16:32.058 --> 01:16:33.799]  They know the president is turning the economy back on.
[01:16:34.059 --> 01:16:37.201]  He's about to go on a foreign trip and cement himself as presidential.
[01:16:37.461 --> 01:16:41.563]  He's about to make Saudi Arabia do a deal to not back Islamic expansion.
[01:16:41.983 --> 01:16:43.324]  He's really trying to bring real stability.
[01:16:43.384 --> 01:16:44.144]  They're panicking.
[01:16:44.745 --> 01:16:46.326]  Soros wants to drive down the dollar.
[01:16:47.806 --> 01:16:52.049]  He's obviously bet against what's happening right now, so he's making money off of stock market plunging.
[01:16:52.429 --> 01:16:53.850]  That's on Infowars.com.
[01:16:55.811 --> 01:16:57.572]  The Dow's dropped 250 plus points.
[01:16:59.741 --> 01:17:03.854]  But you've got a total bureaucratic rebellion, a total bureaucratic...
[01:17:05.149 --> 01:17:05.549]  MUTINY
[01:17:35.509 --> 01:17:36.950]  I know his family.
[01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:39.951]  Leon Skousen, his uncle, wrote to make a communist.
[01:17:40.211 --> 01:17:41.571]  Exposed the whole current paradigm.
[01:17:41.591 --> 01:17:44.433]  And of course he had family that was regional heads of the FBI.
[01:17:44.473 --> 01:17:46.773]  So you can give us some of the inside baseball on that.
[01:17:47.454 --> 01:17:51.635]  But this is an incredible time with Dana Bash admitting this is a deep state coup against Trump.
[01:17:52.336 --> 01:17:53.236]  They're accelerating this.
[01:17:54.076 --> 01:17:57.698]  Where are we right now and what do you think we can do to respond to this?
[01:17:58.358 --> 01:18:01.179]  And what should the president do right now, Joel Skousen?
[01:18:03.046 --> 01:18:03.747]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:18:03.827 --> 01:18:04.908]  It's good to be with you again.
[01:18:04.928 --> 01:18:12.935]  I wish I were confident that Trump was really intending to prosecute.
[01:18:14.176 --> 01:18:19.000]  You know, you and I both were very enthusiastic and optimistic about Trump's ability.
[01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:23.464]  We saw him heavily manipulated by the advisers around him.
[01:18:23.965 --> 01:18:24.745]  They're still there.
[01:18:27.047 --> 01:18:31.129]  You know, Comey basically betrayed Trump.
[01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:37.533]  Trump really played nice with Comey, said nice things to him after he was elected.
[01:18:38.553 --> 01:18:49.679]  You know, Comey came out and did the Uma Abedin email announcement just before the election, really not so much to swing it to Donald Trump, but to
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:57.264]  Make it less obvious that he was a shill for the government and a shill for Hillary Clinton.
[01:18:57.744 --> 01:19:03.368]  But he was, and as he began to continue to prosecute this Russian scandal,
[01:19:04.617 --> 01:19:05.557]  Which is fake news.
[01:19:05.857 --> 01:19:07.298]  Total fake intelligence.
[01:19:09.358 --> 01:19:10.878]  Donald Trump finally had enough.
[01:19:11.398 --> 01:19:17.619]  Trump did, in fact, try to get him to back off on the Michael Flynn investigation after Flynn had resigned.
[01:19:17.639 --> 01:19:18.520]  He said, hey, that's enough.
[01:19:18.580 --> 01:19:19.400]  Let the guy alone.
[01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:21.340]  Comey didn't do that.
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:25.701]  And so I think Trump just felt betrayed and got rid of him.
[01:19:25.781 --> 01:19:31.802]  But so far, I don't see any signs that Trump is still aware
[01:19:32.142 --> 01:19:35.265]  I mean, he just met with Henry Kissinger, called him a wonderful person.
[01:19:35.685 --> 01:19:39.788]  You can't be aware of the deep state if you don't understand who Henry Kissinger is.
[01:19:39.808 --> 01:19:40.589]  Well, that's the word.
[01:19:40.649 --> 01:19:41.029]  Stay there.
[01:19:41.109 --> 01:19:42.530]  I get it from a lot of people that know the president.
[01:19:42.931 --> 01:19:44.172]  He literally is like a throwback.
[01:19:45.313 --> 01:19:52.038]  He really just thinks that we're all patriots, we're going to save America, and he can't believe that people have this larger agenda.
[01:19:52.458 --> 01:19:56.101]  He just keeps expecting them to get in line with making America great again.
[01:19:56.141 --> 01:19:56.742]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:00.892 --> 01:20:12.599]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:18.263]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield, toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[01:20:18.683 --> 01:20:20.004]  It's made in the USA.
[01:20:20.645 --> 01:20:20.765]  It's
[01:20:21.405 --> 01:20:22.066]  We're good to go!
[01:20:43.979 --> 01:20:44.099]  Yes.
[01:21:06.112 --> 01:21:06.252]  What's
[01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:35.606]  You owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[01:21:35.666 --> 01:21:43.932]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:21:44.132 --> 01:21:50.876]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the New World Order.
[01:21:51.875 --> 01:21:55.656]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[01:21:56.116 --> 01:22:00.498]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:22:00.958 --> 01:22:05.099]  This is the InfoWars Power Pack, and it can start your car if it has a dead battery.
[01:22:05.479 --> 01:22:08.420]  And we're going to show you this car won't even turn over.
[01:22:11.829 --> 01:22:14.490]  And now we're going to use the PowerPak to jumpstart this truck.
[01:22:15.090 --> 01:22:15.991]  It's very simple.
[01:22:16.151 --> 01:22:19.432]  All you do is pop up this tab right here and insert the connector.
[01:22:20.232 --> 01:22:24.834]  Connect the black clip to your negative terminal and the red clip to the positive terminal on your battery.
[01:22:25.574 --> 01:22:30.316]  Switch on the PowerPak, wait a few minutes, and then you'll be able to start your car.
[01:22:31.056 --> 01:22:36.218]  With just a few minutes on the Infowars BatteryPak, you go from a dead battery to this.
[01:22:42.816 --> 01:22:45.579]  You get all that cranking power in this little brick.
[01:22:48.803 --> 01:22:50.065]  And with that, you're on your way.
[01:22:51.448 --> 01:22:53.829]  This is the InfoWars Premium Power Pack.
[01:22:54.570 --> 01:22:59.873]  It's the perfect backup power device for camping, hunting, and any off-the-grid adventure.
[01:23:00.173 --> 01:23:04.896]  The InfoWars Power Pack comes in this sturdy storage case and includes the following accessories.
[01:23:05.136 --> 01:23:14.882]  The powerful 14,000 milliamp hour battery, jumper cables, USB cables for any device you might need, a car charger to charge on the go, and a wall charger.
[01:23:14.902 --> 01:23:18.544]  The Power Pack includes a handy flashlight with flashlight,
[01:23:19.404 --> 01:23:21.785]  SOS, and a strobe function.
[01:23:22.945 --> 01:23:27.066]  With three high-powered USB ports, you can charge three devices simultaneously.
[01:23:27.766 --> 01:23:33.727]  The InfoWars PowerPak is a must-have, and it'll give you peace of mind whether you're at home or on the go.
[01:23:34.347 --> 01:23:39.769]  It's so compact, it'll fit in your backpack, your glove box, or even your back pocket.
[01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:44.930]  Get one for your home, boat, car, camping setup, or just for emergencies.
[01:23:45.450 --> 01:23:52.453]  Secure your peace of mind today and order your InfoWars power pack from InfoWarsStore.com or dial 1-888-253-3139 and order today.
[01:23:52.473 --> 01:24:13.103]  We can sit here and go back and forth on whether Trump knows what he's facing or not.
[01:24:14.443 --> 01:24:16.644]  But regardless, the globalists are launching their main assault.
[01:24:18.726 --> 01:24:21.087]  And they're just so evil, and it's so obvious.
[01:24:24.349 --> 01:24:27.271]  And we're looking at this, wondering, where is it going from here?
[01:24:28.912 --> 01:24:32.435]  That's why Trump has to go on the offense, but how does he do that?
[01:24:33.775 --> 01:24:37.478]  It shows how real Trump is, though, that his own advisors come out, and his own people,
[01:24:38.769 --> 01:24:41.131]  And say, oh, you know, we authorized it.
[01:24:41.491 --> 01:24:45.935]  We said Comey and Recommendations is doing a bad job, the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General.
[01:24:46.315 --> 01:24:47.977]  And Trump goes, yeah, yeah, they did that, but...
[01:24:50.151 --> 01:24:53.273]  I fired him too over not investigating leaks and this whole made-up Russia deal.
[01:24:53.594 --> 01:24:54.554]  They go, oh, obstruction.
[01:24:54.574 --> 01:24:56.156]  He's like, no, it's made up.
[01:24:56.896 --> 01:24:58.137]  He's actually being honest.
[01:24:58.898 --> 01:25:00.499]  And I've talked to folks that know Trump really well.
[01:25:00.539 --> 01:25:05.883]  They say he's almost like autistic when it comes to not lying and just saying what he really thinks.
[01:25:06.383 --> 01:25:07.724]  And so they're calling that a bad thing.
[01:25:07.824 --> 01:25:08.665]  I think that's a good thing.
[01:25:08.685 --> 01:25:10.286]  Joel Skousen, you're a smart guy.
[01:25:10.306 --> 01:25:12.127]  I mean, I really respect your long-term view on this.
[01:25:12.428 --> 01:25:13.568]  Where do you see this going?
[01:25:14.009 --> 01:25:15.090]  How do you see this unfolding?
[01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:16.150]  Because like Colonel Schaefer said,
[01:25:17.091 --> 01:25:19.495]  This is an info war, deep state, globalist.
[01:25:19.895 --> 01:25:22.279]  Most of the intelligence agency people don't like what's happening.
[01:25:22.639 --> 01:25:26.445]  This is not the 1970s with Nixon, and I think Trump's a better person than Nixon.
[01:25:27.166 --> 01:25:30.010]  I mean, I think the globalists are desperate here, but how do you see this unfolding?
[01:25:31.544 --> 01:25:40.516]  Well, they are desperate because, you know, Trump in firing Comey has just shown this one aspect of his personality, and that's his unpredictability.
[01:25:40.916 --> 01:25:42.519]  I mean, sure, he could be flattered.
[01:25:42.579 --> 01:25:44.481]  He can be manipulated.
[01:25:44.962 --> 01:25:47.806]  But, you know, you cross him and he starts to see something going on.
[01:25:47.826 --> 01:25:49.328]  He can turn on you in a minute.
[01:25:49.748 --> 01:25:58.893]  I mean, it's not like George W. Bush or any other puppet president who they may attack on the left to keep him steered in the right direction.
[01:25:59.313 --> 01:26:04.236]  I mean, Trump is being manipulated, but he turned on them.
[01:26:04.576 --> 01:26:05.297]  That's right.
[01:26:05.317 --> 01:26:13.241]  He can be manipulated, and he can make mistakes, but he isn't evil at his heart, like you said in your analysis from the beginning, and he means well, and that's why they're scared of him.
[01:26:14.028 --> 01:26:14.969]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:26:15.609 --> 01:26:22.333]  And my basic worry, though, Alex, is he just doesn't have the background in conspiracy.
[01:26:22.353 --> 01:26:23.294]  Well, let me stop you there.
[01:26:23.334 --> 01:26:24.754]  And the reason I'm interrupting is you're so on target.
[01:26:24.794 --> 01:26:30.458]  You said almost two years ago, when it looked like he might win long term, all the same thing.
[01:26:30.518 --> 01:26:34.720]  How were you able to psychologically do the accurate analysis of him?
[01:26:34.740 --> 01:26:37.242]  Because only now do we see this is the accurate.
[01:26:37.262 --> 01:26:40.384]  A good guy who means well goes off what he knows.
[01:26:41.565 --> 01:26:47.040]  Won't be pushed around, can be flattered, but is also the wild card because he really cares about America.
[01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:48.704]  I mean, how did you know his profile?
[01:26:50.165 --> 01:26:54.746]  Well, because I know how difficult it is to come to a proper understanding of the conspiracy.
[01:26:54.786 --> 01:26:55.846]  You've got to have depth.
[01:26:55.886 --> 01:26:56.846]  You've got to have background.
[01:26:56.866 --> 01:26:57.887]  You've been in this for years.
[01:26:58.267 --> 01:27:00.987]  I've been in this since I was 17, Alex.
[01:27:01.207 --> 01:27:11.649]  And it is so difficult to perceive the level of deception when you get through the, you know, the Kennedy assassination and the TW800 downing and 9-11.
[01:27:12.029 --> 01:27:15.470]  You have to go into the details to be able to... You can't just
[01:27:16.030 --> 01:27:25.375]  Like Trump does, do a cursory read of the internet, and come to some correct conclusions that, yeah, that looks like there's a conspiracy, but without the depth, without the background.
[01:27:25.395 --> 01:27:35.601]  He doesn't know the deep patterns and how this is complex, but these evildoers, they're very neurotic or OCD, and now they pathologically do the same things.
[01:27:37.145 --> 01:27:37.705]  Yes, they do.
[01:27:38.065 --> 01:27:54.551]  And as I say, that's why I've been able to predict what the globalists are going to do after a long, long study in my own experience in Washington, my own experience in the military, looking at the yesmanship there and how people are compromised slowly and how the conspiracy... You warned a McMaster up front.
[01:27:54.591 --> 01:27:55.732]  He has turned out to be really bad.
[01:27:56.872 --> 01:27:57.433]  That's correct.
[01:27:57.553 --> 01:27:58.554]  He's very, very bad.
[01:27:58.735 --> 01:28:00.597]  And Mattis is turning out to be bad, too.
[01:28:00.998 --> 01:28:02.600]  He just is not a good thinker.
[01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:05.544]  I mean, anybody who gets to be a general in the military is a yes-man.
[01:28:05.944 --> 01:28:13.154]  The establishment has been indoctrinated by Georgetown professors at the national universities in globalism.
[01:28:13.815 --> 01:28:17.499]  And they don't get to be generals unless they go along with that, unless they don't fight it.
[01:28:17.759 --> 01:28:23.925]  So I just don't have confidence still that we have anyone who's got his ear.
[01:28:24.045 --> 01:28:35.817]  I mean, Steve Bannon is the closest thing to somebody who is anti-globalist and who is not for this raising the troop level in Afghanistan that Mattis and McMasters are trying to get Trump to go along with.
[01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:40.983]  And but he doesn't understand globalism either in terms of its details.
[01:28:42.043 --> 01:28:43.244]  And so he's not able.
[01:28:43.264 --> 01:28:51.310]  I mean, the biggest thing that someone needs to get to Trump and, you know, you and I have tried for months to get to him without success.
[01:28:51.710 --> 01:28:54.812]  He needs to understand the false flag nature of terror.
[01:28:55.252 --> 01:28:57.074]  He need to understand that the U.S.
[01:28:57.494 --> 01:29:06.640]  deep state is funding terror, is created ISIS, and you're using Turkey and Saudi Arabia and Bahrain and Qatar, you know, to fund them.
[01:29:07.521 --> 01:29:12.065]  I just don't have any confidence yet that he's going to Saudi Arabia to undo that, frankly.
[01:29:14.107 --> 01:29:16.829]  Because they'll tell him what he wants to hear and then turn around to the opposite.
[01:29:17.470 --> 01:29:17.890]  That's right.
[01:29:18.250 --> 01:29:18.651]  That's right.
[01:29:18.911 --> 01:29:27.719]  Well, just to be clear, I know some of our info has gotten through, but the problem is if you talk to the president now, he knows he's being recorded and it's like talking to a robot.
[01:29:30.231 --> 01:29:37.752]  You look at this story about the leaking of so-called class information about this laptop stuff, you know, this potential laptop bomb.
[01:29:38.093 --> 01:29:39.953]  Well, this isn't a big story.
[01:29:39.993 --> 01:29:45.334]  I mean, anybody can conceive of the fact there's a laptop capable of putting explosives in a laptop.
[01:29:45.414 --> 01:29:45.914]  Stay there.
[01:29:46.294 --> 01:29:46.854]  We've got to go to break.
[01:29:46.874 --> 01:29:47.394]  Come back with that.
[01:29:49.535 --> 01:29:50.475]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.495 --> 01:29:52.535]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.455 --> 01:29:56.136]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.109 --> 01:30:03.254]  Imagine the world without InfoWars.
[01:30:06.697 --> 01:30:08.598]  The globalists have already consolidated their ballot.
[01:30:09.199 --> 01:30:12.880]  They don't want people to have their own economies, their own choices.
[01:30:13.621 --> 01:30:26.928]  When you spread the links to Infowars.com news stories and our videos, when you tell friends, family, and neighbors about our free iPhone and Droid apps, or send them a link to our daily podcast, you are involved in a revolutionary act against tyranny.
[01:30:27.348 --> 01:30:32.511]  It was George Orwell that said, in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[01:30:33.271 --> 01:30:44.504]  That's why I spend a lot of time trying to not just innovate news and analysis and our fight against the globalists, but also thinking about how we're able to fund our operation.
[01:30:44.784 --> 01:30:47.327]  That's so critical to prosecute an information war.
[01:30:48.508 --> 01:31:03.479]  And I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic and high quality.
[01:31:03.859 --> 01:31:06.021]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we have private labeled it.
[01:31:07.348 --> 01:31:19.670]  And it is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emrix Essentials, and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from InfoWareStore.com.
[01:31:20.510 --> 01:31:29.152]  On top of that, if you sign up for AutoShip, you get an additional, out of the gates, 25% off on this product.
[01:31:29.732 --> 01:31:34.833]  Emrix Essentials is all about personal care, hygiene, not getting skin cancer.
[01:31:35.373 --> 01:31:39.056]  Not getting bit by a bunch of bugs and gnats and mosquitoes.
[01:31:39.556 --> 01:31:40.517]  It's all there.
[01:31:40.697 --> 01:31:44.759]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash.
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:47.301]  All of it is truly game-changing.
[01:31:47.801 --> 01:31:48.582]  Be-A-Way Spray.
[01:31:48.902 --> 01:31:50.904]  Totally organic, essential oils.
[01:31:51.644 --> 01:31:55.186]  Works a lot better than the toxic chemical systems that are out there.
[01:31:55.567 --> 01:31:57.848]  And it is comparable in price.
[01:31:58.128 --> 01:31:59.589]  And again, it's concentrated.
[01:31:59.910 --> 01:32:01.331]  The deodorant is amazing.
[01:32:01.791 --> 01:32:02.471]  High quality.
[01:32:03.152 --> 01:32:04.693]  Doesn't have the aluminum garbage in it.
[01:32:04.993 --> 01:32:05.713]  Totally natural.
[01:32:05.994 --> 01:32:06.494]  Works great.
[01:32:07.415 --> 01:32:07.935]  SPF 30.
[01:32:08.495 --> 01:32:09.636]  Face and body lotion.
[01:32:09.676 --> 01:32:10.256]  Sunscreen.
[01:32:10.657 --> 01:32:11.197]  Unscented.
[01:32:11.737 --> 01:32:12.698]  This is exciting.
[01:32:12.798 --> 01:32:16.481]  Because so many of the so-called sunscreens that are out there are toxic.
[01:32:16.961 --> 01:32:18.942]  As everyone knows, I'm obsessed with Win-Wins.
[01:32:18.962 --> 01:32:19.603]  20% off what it is retail.
[01:32:22.104 --> 01:32:23.285]  Because we cut out the middleman.
[01:32:24.065 --> 01:32:26.707]  And then, additionally, you sign up for auto-ship out of the gates.
[01:32:26.727 --> 01:32:28.528]  25% off that.
[01:32:28.988 --> 01:32:31.009]  Because I want you to try these products.
[01:32:31.149 --> 01:32:32.390]  I want you to love these products.
[01:32:32.730 --> 01:32:43.356]  I want to have a deeper relationship with you in a 360 win, a non-zero-sum game, where you get high quality, you get value, and you repeat order something you need every month.
[01:32:44.236 --> 01:32:51.863]  And then we're able to secure our funding into the future to not just stay at the level we're at, but to grow in the face of enemy attacks.
[01:32:52.143 --> 01:32:56.768]  InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, and you'll find Emmerich's Essentials.
[01:33:10.911 --> 01:33:13.033]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:13.514 --> 01:33:15.476]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:15.636 --> 01:33:21.241]  I'm Alex Jones, and I am the 1836 Deep State.
[01:33:25.805 --> 01:33:31.387]  I've had folks that are well-known patriots in the government that are battling the globalists.
[01:33:31.967 --> 01:33:33.168]  We played a clip of one of them earlier.
[01:33:33.888 --> 01:33:37.309]  Think that I'm like part of some deep state stay-behind network for America.
[01:33:37.349 --> 01:33:38.950]  No, none of that happened.
[01:33:39.530 --> 01:33:42.231]  I am literally organic and real just like you are.
[01:33:42.291 --> 01:33:46.193]  It's organic and real like your mama and your daddy having you that has the power.
[01:33:46.613 --> 01:33:48.013]  And all this fake government crap.
[01:33:48.093 --> 01:33:50.794]  I am so proud of the fact I'm not connected to any of that stuff.
[01:33:51.575 --> 01:33:51.975]  Somebody like
[01:33:53.191 --> 01:33:56.553]  Our guest is on is a very competent, honorable, great man.
[01:33:56.673 --> 01:34:02.797]  His family has borne great fruits, but he'll tell you working on the system only taught him about the Treasury and taught him what not to do.
[01:34:03.457 --> 01:34:07.820]  And even though he's run some of the biggest conservative caucuses and tried to save this country, he realizes that
[01:34:09.695 --> 01:34:16.458]  The nation is so evil that we probably really need to focus on ourselves, our communities, and we hope people like Trump could defeat them.
[01:34:17.318 --> 01:34:19.119]  But the truth is the corruption is just so deep.
[01:34:19.719 --> 01:34:24.641]  But how do we keep the destruction of Trump, if it's going to happen, from bringing us into an even larger civil war?
[01:34:24.661 --> 01:34:26.922]  We'll talk about that in a few minutes with Joel Skousen.
[01:34:27.382 --> 01:34:33.705]  I get so focused that even though right now we're not even bringing in the money we need week to week, the last few weeks even fund our operation.
[01:34:34.761 --> 01:34:36.262]  I didn't plug one time last hour.
[01:34:36.282 --> 01:34:37.644]  I skip breaks.
[01:34:38.865 --> 01:34:39.385]  I do it all.
[01:34:41.647 --> 01:34:54.879]  And I just need to tell the listeners, if you want to see us continue on, and if you want to see us expand in the face of this as they come after us, we need you to go to mfulworthstore.com, whether it's water filtration or non-GMO heirloom seeds or the supplements.
[01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:58.132]  Or the Trump is my President shirts that are part of history.
[01:34:58.152 --> 01:35:00.054]  Those are at cost right now, $4.95.
[01:35:00.495 --> 01:35:01.736]  We need your financial support.
[01:35:01.796 --> 01:35:08.843]  Now, I'm going to play a little three-minute piece and go back to Joel Skousen that I shot a few days ago with the new Emrix Essentials.
[01:35:09.484 --> 01:35:13.988]  We did market analysis and they like, you know, we're somebody's name, like Tom's of Maine.
[01:35:14.388 --> 01:35:16.350]  That's who private labels our toothpaste that we had.
[01:35:17.011 --> 01:35:18.252]  It's a little silver and iodine to it.
[01:35:18.432 --> 01:35:18.952]  Great product.
[01:35:19.453 --> 01:35:20.634]  That's our super blue toothpaste.
[01:35:20.694 --> 01:35:26.338]  But in this case, usually the private labeler sells in stores, so they don't want you to particularly say who they are.
[01:35:26.378 --> 01:35:27.359]  They just let you private label.
[01:35:27.399 --> 01:35:31.622]  But this Patriot is the number three largest, but I can't even say his name.
[01:35:31.642 --> 01:35:35.184]  I'm going to leave it alone, because I think a lot of us go after whoever we're working with, but they'll be able to figure it out.
[01:35:35.605 --> 01:35:40.148]  A lot of you probably recognize the packaging if you're watching us on TV, because he'd let us use his own packaging.
[01:35:40.168 --> 01:35:42.189]  We just changed the name to Emirates Essentials.
[01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:44.071]  This is one of the leading organic
[01:35:45.319 --> 01:36:05.474]  Lines of personal care from mouthwash to body wash to shampoo to SPF natural high-quality non-nano zinc so it's not toxic it's really good for you and we've got high quality non non-metal deodorant we've got great natural bug spray to keep the bugs off of you be away
[01:36:07.256 --> 01:36:10.500]  And out of the gates, it's 20% less than they sell their products in stores.
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:11.260]  There's not a middleman.
[01:36:11.581 --> 01:36:12.301]  We probably label it.
[01:36:12.602 --> 01:36:13.783]  And then I'm doing 25% off.
[01:36:13.963 --> 01:36:18.368]  We usually do 10% off, but with Emmerich Essentials, I think you're gonna like it so much.
[01:36:18.388 --> 01:36:19.008]  25% off on the
[01:36:23.232 --> 01:36:23.873]  I don't know.
[01:36:39.369 --> 01:36:51.796]  Because I'm the type that uses my own toothpaste and then I run out and my office is 15 miles from home and a mile away is a drugstore and I go in there and there's not fluoride free or high quality toothpaste and I'm like, I'm not going to have a stinky mouth, I'm going to just get some fluoride toothpaste.
[01:36:51.976 --> 01:36:55.838]  Because my dad's a dentist and fluoride does help your teeth topically, it's just bad cumulatively.
[01:36:55.878 --> 01:36:59.520]  So every once in a while I'll actually do a limited fluoride treatment because it really does work.
[01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:02.261]  It's just that a lot of it brain damages you and causes problems.
[01:37:02.281 --> 01:37:06.204]  The point is I'll end up using fluoride toothpaste because you can't even get non-fluoride toothpaste.
[01:37:06.224 --> 01:37:07.284]  Well we've private labeled that.
[01:37:07.784 --> 01:37:08.305]  Well we now...
[01:37:09.025 --> 01:37:10.545]  It's the same folks that make Tom's of Maine.
[01:37:10.725 --> 01:37:15.547]  Well, this is another company, the third largest out there, and you'll recognize the bottles.
[01:37:16.407 --> 01:37:17.827]  It's now called Imbrix Essentials.
[01:37:17.867 --> 01:37:24.509]  So that's 45% off when you order the auto ship, because you're already getting 20% off retail, and you're getting an additional 25% off.
[01:37:24.529 --> 01:37:25.829]  Here's a little promo piece.
[01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:29.830]  I shot to break all this down, but here's the deal.
[01:37:34.512 --> 01:37:35.652]  I don't want to talk about
[01:37:36.869 --> 01:37:40.230]  The stuff going on behind the scenes, but it's been, let's just say, substantive.
[01:37:40.830 --> 01:37:46.991]  And quite frankly, very positive in many ways, because I know I'm doing a good job.
[01:37:47.732 --> 01:37:50.212]  It makes me a little bit guilty that I haven't been as strong as I wish.
[01:37:50.272 --> 01:37:53.893]  I'm a very fleshly person, but God forgives me every day for it, and I try to be a good person.
[01:37:53.913 --> 01:37:58.034]  But other than the nightmares and stuff, my life's pretty good.
[01:37:58.054 --> 01:38:03.796]  When I'm asleep, you know, the subconscious is weaker, and I have to think about the things they've done publicly and behind the scenes.
[01:38:04.196 --> 01:38:04.996]  And I'm not complaining.
[01:38:08.103 --> 01:38:11.008]  It's just, I don't want to lose, because these people are so bad.
[01:38:11.028 --> 01:38:16.076]  And if you'll just pray for us, and if you'll just buy the products we produce, they're a great deal.
[01:38:16.337 --> 01:38:17.098]  They're high quality.
[01:38:18.123 --> 01:38:22.006]  And if you'll just continue to financially support us and our local affiliates, we won't lose.
[01:38:22.527 --> 01:38:24.848]  And I don't get tears in my eyes because I'm feeling sorry for myself.
[01:38:25.689 --> 01:38:39.280]  I get tears in my eyes because if the American people knew the true satanic pedophile evil we're facing and just how demonic it is, and I've brushed up against it more than once, it hurts my soul to get this close to this evil.
[01:38:41.084 --> 01:38:55.238]  It makes me get incredibly angry with myself that I haven't been stronger in the face of this, and I've made jokes about it, and I don't mean jokes, I mean I have fun on air and stuff, and I just really, I need to be even more focused, and I need you to be more focused, because this is the takeover we're facing.
[01:38:55.278 --> 01:39:03.546]  These people hate us because we're Christians, they hate God, they hate free will, and they hate our children, they hate innocence, they hate all God's gifts, and
[01:39:04.147 --> 01:39:11.974]  We're in a spiritual war, and if you'll just pray for us, more important than buying the products, and if you'll just spread the word, we will be able to continue on.
[01:39:11.994 --> 01:39:17.058]  And I didn't mean to, you know, start choking up here on air.
[01:39:17.118 --> 01:39:22.483]  It's just that you don't know how evil this is until you actually face it and actually start beating it.
[01:39:22.763 --> 01:39:26.567]  And then you get to take on the really big, nasty stuff that's out there.
[01:39:26.667 --> 01:39:28.588]  And it makes you realize that
[01:39:29.687 --> 01:39:32.548]  There are a lot of innocents out there that never had a chance to know what hit them.
[01:39:33.028 --> 01:39:40.890]  And it's up to us that are strong men to really pray that God give us the strength and others the strength to bring down this enemy.
[01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:42.290]  We can only do it through Christ.
[01:39:42.890 --> 01:39:49.492]  That's why the enemy, that's why Trump has Pence talking about Christians being persecuted and how Christianity and saying the name of Jesus, they hate that.
[01:39:49.912 --> 01:39:51.373]  And so that's why the enemy is so upset.
[01:39:51.393 --> 01:39:52.193]  This is a real battle.
[01:39:52.793 --> 01:39:54.654]  So I'm going to play this piece and then give Skousen the floor.
[01:39:54.694 --> 01:40:00.378]  I know I'm ranting here, but because we're not plugging a lot here on air, because I'm so focused, I need your financial support.
[01:40:00.418 --> 01:40:02.039]  And these are great things.
[01:40:02.079 --> 01:40:07.243]  The best non-GMO heirloom seeds, the best water filtration systems, the best durable foods for low prices.
[01:40:07.543 --> 01:40:09.684]  You get better stuff at higher prices, obviously, but this is good quality.
[01:40:10.125 --> 01:40:16.008]  I mean, this Emrix Essentials is excellent, and it's a godsend that it took us years to finally have a personal care line.
[01:40:16.329 --> 01:40:19.131]  And we waited and waited to have the best and finally got one of the very best.
[01:40:19.371 --> 01:40:20.111]  The crews used it.
[01:40:20.131 --> 01:40:20.532]  They love it.
[01:40:20.552 --> 01:40:21.852]  So here's my little three-minute piece.
[01:40:21.872 --> 01:40:22.673]  We'll go to Joel Skousen.
[01:40:23.995 --> 01:40:26.179]  Imagine the world without InfoWars.
[01:40:27.466 --> 01:40:31.629]  The globalists have already consolidated their ballot.
[01:40:32.130 --> 01:40:35.813]  They don't want people to have their own economies, their own choices.
[01:40:36.533 --> 01:40:49.844]  When you spread the links to Infowars.com news stories and our videos, when you tell friends, family, and neighbors about our free iPhone and Droid apps, or send them a link to our daily podcast, you are involved in a revolutionary act against tyranny.
[01:40:50.104 --> 01:40:55.429]  It was George Orwell that said, in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[01:40:56.189 --> 01:41:07.416]  That's why I spend a lot of time trying to not just innovate news and analysis and our fight against the globalists, but also thinking about how we're able to fund our operation.
[01:41:07.696 --> 01:41:10.237]  That's so critical to prosecute an information war.
[01:41:11.418 --> 01:41:26.364]  And I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic and high quality.
[01:41:26.784 --> 01:41:28.945]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we have private labeled it.
[01:41:29.805 --> 01:41:30.646]  We're good to go!
[01:41:46.485 --> 01:41:52.067]  You get an additional, out of the gates, 25% off on this product.
[01:41:52.627 --> 01:41:55.268]  Emerix Essentials is all about personal care.
[01:41:55.708 --> 01:42:01.970]  Hygiene, not getting skin cancer, not getting bit by a bunch of bugs and gnats and mosquitoes.
[01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:03.431]  It's all there.
[01:42:03.611 --> 01:42:07.572]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash.
[01:42:08.112 --> 01:42:10.193]  All of it is truly game-changing.
[01:42:10.713 --> 01:42:11.494]  BOA spray.
[01:42:11.814 --> 01:42:13.835]  Totally organic, essential oils.
[01:42:14.555 --> 01:42:18.117]  Works a lot better than the toxic chemical systems that are out there.
[01:42:18.477 --> 01:42:20.758]  And it is comparable in price.
[01:42:21.059 --> 01:42:22.479]  And again, it's concentrated.
[01:42:22.819 --> 01:42:24.260]  The deodorant is amazing.
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:25.401]  High quality.
[01:42:26.061 --> 01:42:27.602]  Doesn't have the aluminum garbage in it.
[01:42:27.902 --> 01:42:28.642]  Totally natural.
[01:42:28.902 --> 01:42:29.363]  Works great.
[01:42:30.323 --> 01:42:34.108]  SPF 30, face and body lotion, sunscreen, unscented.
[01:42:34.649 --> 01:42:39.414]  This is exciting, because so many of the so-called sunscreens that are out there are toxic.
[01:42:39.875 --> 01:42:42.918]  As everyone knows, I'm obsessed with Win-Wins.
[01:42:42.938 --> 01:42:46.162]  20% off what it is retail, because we cut out the middleman.
[01:42:46.983 --> 01:42:51.406]  And then, additionally, if you sign up for AutoShip, out of the gates, 25% off that.
[01:42:51.906 --> 01:42:53.927]  Because I want you to try these products.
[01:42:54.067 --> 01:42:55.308]  I want you to love these products.
[01:42:55.648 --> 01:43:06.254]  I want to have a deeper relationship with you in a 360 win, a non-zero-sum game, where you get high quality, you get value, and you repeat order something you need every month.
[01:43:07.154 --> 01:43:14.775]  And then we're able to secure our funding into the future to not just stay at the level we're at, but to grow in the face of enemy attacks.
[01:43:15.035 --> 01:43:19.676]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, and you'll find Emmerich's Essentials.
[01:43:22.277 --> 01:43:26.197]  All right, folks, I'm done with the long plug, and I appreciate Joel Skousen sitting there for 10 minutes while I was ranting.
[01:43:26.217 --> 01:43:27.578]  Let me just give you the breaking news.
[01:43:30.478 --> 01:43:35.059]  At the start of the next segment, because I still got to make these phone calls, because I've been given a lot of big news from the White House.
[01:43:36.001 --> 01:43:38.362]  From two different sources, today and another source.
[01:43:39.203 --> 01:43:41.104]  And you notice our leaks always turn out to be accurate.
[01:43:41.124 --> 01:43:43.285]  These are real sources, the Patriots that are there.
[01:43:46.126 --> 01:43:54.111]  And I'm trying to figure out exactly how to put this out the right way because the limited information I've been given, I don't want them to spin it and say I got it wrong.
[01:43:55.171 --> 01:43:57.613]  But let's go back to Joel Scalzen.
[01:43:57.633 --> 01:44:02.195]  Joel, I'm going to try to shut up and let you for the next 15-20 minutes talk about where we're at, the crossroads.
[01:44:02.255 --> 01:44:03.756]  Where do we go if they defeat Trump?
[01:44:05.322 --> 01:44:07.103]  What type of world do the globalists want to build?
[01:44:07.443 --> 01:44:08.983]  Why are they so desperate to bring him down?
[01:44:09.283 --> 01:44:13.825]  How could Trump strike back if he was actually listening to you or myself or others?
[01:44:14.165 --> 01:44:17.626]  The word is he does go in and try to do stuff and they just ignore him everywhere.
[01:44:17.946 --> 01:44:22.227]  I know top-level folks are telling him, so is the military, go ahead and just purge basically everybody.
[01:44:23.168 --> 01:44:26.989]  I know you try to lead a movement to restore things in Washington.
[01:44:27.009 --> 01:44:27.729]  What do you think we should do?
[01:44:29.548 --> 01:44:40.621]  Well it's really tough because in the government you have so many thousands of people that staff these positions and you know Trump took the advice of Reince Priebus and other people putting in establishment people.
[01:44:41.021 --> 01:44:43.704]  I mean look at the leaks as you know when we last talked I
[01:44:45.166 --> 01:44:53.533]  I said this leak aspect about the laptop computer explosive device just shows how bad it is in the White House.
[01:44:53.634 --> 01:45:02.621]  I mean, none of the principals that were actually in the meeting with the Russians, Tillerson, Dana Powell, and McMasters, leaked anything to anyone.
[01:45:03.462 --> 01:45:07.224]  And so all of a sudden you have these claims that, you know, you've compromised sources.
[01:45:07.264 --> 01:45:13.208]  He's told where this information came from and these people, this third party, this ally is not going to give us any.
[01:45:13.268 --> 01:45:14.348]  That's baloney, of course.
[01:45:15.429 --> 01:45:21.453]  But the point is, here's a leak in the White House that they're basically proving, and Trump should know,
[01:45:22.475 --> 01:45:23.716]  This isn't a private meeting.
[01:45:24.276 --> 01:45:37.183]  There are people in this very White House that were watching, whether through wire, not wiretaps, but microphones in the room, etc., and was leaking to the press immediately after this meeting with Lavrov.
[01:45:38.314 --> 01:45:39.816]  This is just incredible.
[01:45:40.297 --> 01:45:41.438]  Now, how do you get rid of this?
[01:45:41.498 --> 01:45:51.572]  Well, it's very, very difficult because, you know, to get proof of who's doing the leaking and stuff, you've got to control the NSA and the dark side of government, that each state controls the NSA.
[01:45:53.614 --> 01:45:55.775]  But there were no essential secrets that were passed.
[01:45:55.795 --> 01:45:58.077]  This was made up out of whole cloth.
[01:45:58.117 --> 01:46:00.618]  This was another fake intelligence like the Russian thing.
[01:46:00.918 --> 01:46:12.325]  But you know, they can do this at will, every single day of the week, because Trump is full of... Trump's administration is full of traitors, basically, to not only Trump but the United States.
[01:46:13.045 --> 01:46:13.225]  So...
[01:46:14.366 --> 01:46:20.230]  To clean house, first of all, you'd have to really protect yourself because you think the attack on Trump is bad.
[01:46:20.290 --> 01:46:24.052]  If he started a really clean house in the deep state, they would clearly assassinate him.
[01:46:24.533 --> 01:46:27.274]  They would never let a person, you know, get away with this.
[01:46:27.294 --> 01:46:35.479]  So you'd have to actually go into a closed situation where you pick your secret service people.
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:38.862]  Trump can exercise good judgment about people.
[01:46:39.742 --> 01:46:41.383]  He doesn't usually, but he can.
[01:46:41.823 --> 01:46:49.428]  But you'd have to be able to do that to make sure that the Secret Service that was involved in the JFK assassination did not take you down.
[01:46:50.128 --> 01:46:51.449]  And it's very difficult to do that.
[01:46:52.530 --> 01:47:00.094]  But if Trump was listening to me, I would say, you know, Mr. President, you have really got to, first of all, take time out.
[01:47:00.394 --> 01:47:01.135]  You've got to get
[01:47:01.775 --> 01:47:07.760]  I mean, you can't relearn what Alex Jones and Joel Skousen took, you know, 20, 30 years of our lives to learn.
[01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:19.370]  You've got to have an advisor in here who's going to parry what you're hearing, who sits by your side and says, all right, this is false, this is true, this is bogus, and this is where to get the right information.
[01:47:19.531 --> 01:47:25.175]  I don't know how you can survive, Mr. President, without somebody from our side who understands the
[01:47:25.876 --> 01:47:29.619]  The great evil of secret combinations, and they are combinations of power.
[01:47:29.999 --> 01:47:39.988]  I get news feeds, for example, hundreds of times a day, and they are covering Alex Jones more than I have ever seen in my entire life before, and none of it is positive.
[01:47:40.368 --> 01:47:42.169]  They're taking plot shots at Alex.
[01:47:43.288 --> 01:47:51.236]  From Media Matters and from CNN and from ABC and NBC and every other news congregator is attacking him because why?
[01:47:51.336 --> 01:47:52.117]  He's effective.
[01:47:52.617 --> 01:47:59.524]  And that's why they've tried to cut off your funding sources, Alex, because they know they've got to get to you some way.
[01:47:59.684 --> 01:48:00.545]  You're being effective.
[01:48:00.945 --> 01:48:03.147]  I mean, for example, Trump has done some good things.
[01:48:03.908 --> 01:48:20.804]  He, for example, opened up the federal databases so that his election investigation on illegal aliens can get the data from the federal database of how many people are on the election rolls that are also illegal immigrants or have green cards that are not citizens.
[01:48:21.605 --> 01:48:23.427]  And Obama would not give that information.
[01:48:24.007 --> 01:48:25.408]  So there's some real positive things.
[01:48:25.508 --> 01:48:31.674]  I mean, he's arming the Kurds, despite Erdogan of Turkey's objections.
[01:48:32.314 --> 01:48:33.856]  I think that's a good move.
[01:48:34.496 --> 01:48:42.023]  But still, you know, you've really got to attack the deep state and go after the deep state if you're going to win this battle.
[01:48:42.743 --> 01:48:44.084]  And how does he do that?
[01:48:44.125 --> 01:48:53.833]  Because constitutionally, if a president is faced with a burrowed outside power, a 21st century espionage, multinational system, like globalism is,
[01:48:55.154 --> 01:48:56.415]  I'm not calling for a hot war.
[01:48:57.015 --> 01:48:57.916]  I'm not calling for anything.
[01:48:57.956 --> 01:49:06.642]  But quite frankly, I think a government this infiltrated, a country under attack, with the New Yorker magazine saying we should have never had 1776, George Washington was bad.
[01:49:07.202 --> 01:49:10.004]  At a certain point, the president could cut the cancer out.
[01:49:10.564 --> 01:49:21.551]  I'm not somebody that ever wants some type of military action, but if we really are facing basically lymphatic cancer, and then we don't move to cut it out, we're just buying time.
[01:49:24.537 --> 01:49:30.803]  Well, as I say, you have to surgically remove what's going on.
[01:49:30.863 --> 01:49:35.367]  You certainly cannot let the deep state continue to sabotage you.
[01:49:35.447 --> 01:49:37.508]  And that really takes someone to go inside.
[01:49:37.568 --> 01:49:39.110]  I mean, you can't find... So how does he do that?
[01:49:39.150 --> 01:49:41.052]  I mean, how does he move?
[01:49:41.072 --> 01:49:43.614]  Because, I mean, they call him meeting with a Russian selling out.
[01:49:43.634 --> 01:49:47.077]  They call him talking about going after cop killers as being fascism.
[01:49:47.998 --> 01:49:48.838]  We're so paralyzed.
[01:49:48.858 --> 01:49:49.319]  What does he do?
[01:49:56.681 --> 01:49:57.383]  What does he do, Joel?
[01:49:58.346 --> 01:49:59.690]  Yeah, I did hear the question.
[01:49:59.750 --> 01:50:01.415]  It's just that... It's delayed.
[01:50:02.417 --> 01:50:03.541]  You know, I can...
[01:50:04.634 --> 01:50:06.095]  I could see it if I were in there.
[01:50:06.135 --> 01:50:07.936]  You know, you've got to have some perception.
[01:50:08.136 --> 01:50:15.579]  I'm just not sure that Trump can see it without somebody who he trusts that he can bring in to do the job for him.
[01:50:15.959 --> 01:50:19.241]  I mean, you've got to have an understanding that this is a satanic conspiracy.
[01:50:19.261 --> 01:50:23.122]  You've got to have the ability to perceive evil people who are lying to you.
[01:50:23.563 --> 01:50:25.263]  I'm convinced that Trump can't do that.
[01:50:26.784 --> 01:50:28.385]  And so he's got to trust somebody.
[01:50:29.005 --> 01:50:30.706]  It's just incredible to me, Alex.
[01:50:30.726 --> 01:50:33.167]  Bottom line, he needs somebody who has real spiritual discernment.
[01:50:33.871 --> 01:50:34.271]  That's right.
[01:50:34.691 --> 01:50:35.752]  There's just no substitute.
[01:50:35.772 --> 01:50:47.897]  When you're dealing with wolves in sheep's clothing, look at how many good Christians have been deceived, you know, by Dick Cheney and other people they've given honorary doctorates to.
[01:50:47.937 --> 01:50:51.159]  They've given honorary doctorates to Henry Kissinger and to Brent Scowcroft.
[01:50:51.579 --> 01:50:53.940]  You know, these are deep state conspirators.
[01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:56.401]  All right, let's talk about how to defeat that straight ahead.
[01:50:56.441 --> 01:51:00.303]  And I got a clip of Putin talking about how he has a transcript showing they were recording it.
[01:51:03.667 --> 01:51:09.312]  Ron Paul, with his great Liberty Report, reaching millions every day on radio and TV, joining us from Houston.
[01:51:09.852 --> 01:51:11.994]  What do you make of Donald Trump so far?
[01:51:12.014 --> 01:51:16.017]  It does appear that he's really starting to go off track of what he said he was going to do.
[01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:21.802]  Well, I think people are starting to recognize that now.
[01:51:21.922 --> 01:51:31.228]  Our biggest problem in evaluating Trump is we don't know what he'll say tomorrow or the day before yesterday because it's back and forth.
[01:51:31.588 --> 01:51:39.733]  You know, we sort of liked him before he was elected because searching for things that I like, I like the fact that he thought we ought to be more reasonable dealing with Russia.
[01:51:40.193 --> 01:51:41.754]  And then he changed all of a sudden.
[01:51:41.834 --> 01:51:42.955]  But just recently, again,
[01:51:43.115 --> 01:51:46.557]  Yeah, he's talking about, hey, we better lay off Russia.
[01:51:47.158 --> 01:51:58.105]  So it's this lack of understanding of what his real policies are means that the unpredictability of this is very disturbing.
[01:51:58.165 --> 01:51:59.806]  We ought to at least know where people stand.
[01:52:00.106 --> 01:52:03.089]  Here's President Trump saying, I love WikiLeaks, give him a medal.
[01:52:03.370 --> 01:52:04.892]  And then now he's saying, arrest WikiLeaks.
[01:52:05.312 --> 01:52:09.377]  I mean, that is a real betrayal when WikiLeaks was exposing criminal activity.
[01:52:09.737 --> 01:52:12.600]  Trump claims he's all about loyalty, and I've seen that in his past.
[01:52:12.620 --> 01:52:14.162]  Do you think the deep state has gotten to him?
[01:52:15.043 --> 01:52:16.264]  It's hard for me to figure out.
[01:52:16.304 --> 01:52:20.466]  We can say what he has done, but we can't really read his mind on what's going on.
[01:52:20.846 --> 01:52:26.249]  I don't think he approaches things as so many of us try to do from a philosophic principle.
[01:52:26.809 --> 01:52:32.192]  I think his principle is pragmatism and do what you have to do or whatever crosses your mind at the moment.
[01:52:32.452 --> 01:52:38.756]  And then he does yield to the political pressures because he does express things like, I didn't know this was so complicated.
[01:52:39.336 --> 01:52:40.176]  And that is true.
[01:52:40.236 --> 01:52:43.317]  He didn't know too much about how things worked in Washington.
[01:52:43.357 --> 01:52:46.798]  And you can't run Washington like you run a business.
[01:52:46.838 --> 01:52:50.439]  And that's always been a mistake, to think that you can.
[01:52:51.339 --> 01:52:52.719]  Because it isn't a business.
[01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:55.400]  A business is run efficiently.
[01:52:55.420 --> 01:52:57.021]  Governments are inefficient.
[01:52:57.221 --> 01:52:59.641]  And that is the reason you want very little government.
[01:52:59.921 --> 01:53:02.302]  Because they can't manage health care.
[01:53:03.222 --> 01:53:04.702]  It isn't the mismanagement.
[01:53:04.762 --> 01:53:06.703]  It's the fact that they're trying to manage health care.
[01:53:07.003 --> 01:53:14.665]  So that's the way it is with government, and now he's recognized this, and he can't bully his way through that and just say, I am the boss, you know, and this is what's going to happen.
[01:53:14.965 --> 01:53:15.945]  There are too many others.
[01:53:16.005 --> 01:53:25.227]  Everybody in Washington thinks they're the boss, and they like to play this game, and they don't come from the position of what we really want is a lot less government.
[01:53:25.247 --> 01:53:31.969]  So when he talks about draining the swamp, some of us have in our minds, oh, that means he's going to have a lot less
[01:53:32.509 --> 01:53:34.990]  So, the swamp really isn't getting drained.
[01:53:35.010 --> 01:53:36.650]  I mean, I guess it's getting drained a little bit.
[01:53:36.670 --> 01:53:37.631]  What's happening is Trump's getting drained.
[01:54:10.103 --> 01:54:13.024]  Now, here's Putin today saying, look, we got a transcript.
[01:54:13.545 --> 01:54:15.525]  Now, did that mean one of their aides was writing it down in real time?
[01:54:15.545 --> 01:54:16.346]  Or were they recording it?
[01:54:16.366 --> 01:54:19.947]  Well, the truth is, all these people are recording everything, because they've got to protect themselves.
[01:54:20.508 --> 01:54:23.069]  And so Trump said he was recording Comey, and they go, oh, you're like Nixon.
[01:54:23.109 --> 01:54:29.452]  Let me tell you, when you're on the phone with the president, or you're in the room with him, you're being recorded, because you can't have people just make stuff up.
[01:54:29.472 --> 01:54:31.733]  So we're going to play this, and then ask Joel Skousen
[01:54:32.844 --> 01:54:35.526]  Where he thinks the Deep State's next moves are going to be.
[01:54:36.207 --> 01:54:38.689]  Because Joel Skousen was talking 30 years ago about Deep State.
[01:54:38.729 --> 01:54:40.571]  His, you know, his uncle about it 50 years ago.
[01:54:40.951 --> 01:54:44.714]  These are terms that the Liberty Movement basically coined because we were studying it.
[01:54:45.295 --> 01:54:47.937]  I mean, I'm just some, you know, Johnny come lately to all this.
[01:54:49.701 --> 01:54:53.843]  But again, there's also a Patriot Deep State that helped us win.
[01:54:53.923 --> 01:54:55.483]  And we see the Seth Rich situation.
[01:54:55.503 --> 01:55:04.086]  I'll ask Skousen in the next little short segment if he can stay about the latest developments on that with federal investigators, you know, saying, oh no, you know, we've seen the emails, we see it.
[01:55:04.427 --> 01:55:06.367]  The family early on thought he was killed.
[01:55:06.747 --> 01:55:07.788]  Now they're kind of backing off.
[01:55:07.808 --> 01:55:08.648]  But I've seen that before.
[01:55:08.668 --> 01:55:10.509]  We'll see what Joel Skousen thinks in a moment.
[01:55:10.549 --> 01:55:13.270]  But here is Vladimir Putin responding.
[01:55:15.754 --> 01:55:18.474]  We're seeing political schizophrenia developing in the U.S.
[01:55:19.495 --> 01:55:23.616]  I see no other reason for the accusations of Trump revealing any secrets to Sergei Lavrov.
[01:55:24.216 --> 01:55:29.437]  If the American administration agrees, we're ready to provide the transcript of Lavrov and Trump's talks to the U.S.
[01:55:29.457 --> 01:55:30.318]  Senate and Congress.
[01:55:31.998 --> 01:55:35.279]  As if you're going to leak secrets, you do it in a room full of people's aides.
[01:55:35.339 --> 01:55:38.860]  This is the most ridiculous... I have some contacts into the army.
[01:55:40.106 --> 01:56:09.415]  Special operations and they say the way the media put it out what Trump talked about was just the laptops in the news that the the way the Washington Post says the leak was about specifics of Intel and who gave it to us and the infiltration of these groups that that was the high-level stuff the president didn't even know it's so detailed and wasn't in the briefings and I have that I've seen that for some of my sources that even goes into so the most elite army units that are out there Joel Skousen so this is just getting really reckless what do you make of it all?
[01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:17.121]  Well, this is really getting almost comical how the news media is just actually manufacturing things.
[01:56:17.501 --> 01:56:21.102]  I mean, look, if you know Donald Trump, you know there's no way he's a person of details.
[01:56:21.602 --> 01:56:26.783]  He couldn't have remembered the cogent details to repeat them, even if they were classified.
[01:56:27.163 --> 01:56:34.405]  And besides, it's very, very difficult in a classified briefing to, unless you're very experienced in government, to understand, now, what is the real secret here?
[01:56:34.425 --> 01:56:39.386]  You know, the whole subject is classified, but some stuff is sensitive and some stuff isn't.
[01:56:40.186 --> 01:56:44.749]  And, you know, unless Trump were really carefully briefed on that, he wouldn't really know the difference.
[01:56:44.789 --> 01:56:47.852]  So he came out and admitted in a tweet, well, yeah, I admit it.
[01:56:48.292 --> 01:56:50.894]  I mean, I did tell him some classified and it was fully justified.
[01:56:51.454 --> 01:56:58.219]  He meant by that, not that he was confirming the details of Washington Post, that the whole thing that I knew about was classified.
[01:56:58.239 --> 01:57:03.163]  And I did talk about some of that because it was pertinent to the Russians helping us out on this.
[01:57:03.803 --> 01:57:16.754]  So, this is never going to get proven one way or the other down to the bottom line, but all I can tell you, what it really tells me is that Deep State is listening to everything that Trump has been doing, and there's a way to stop that.
[01:57:16.834 --> 01:57:19.857]  I mean, literally, he's got electronic engineers throughout the White House.
[01:57:19.897 --> 01:57:24.721]  They can remove any of the bugs that are there.
[01:57:24.761 --> 01:57:28.324]  Well, you know, I had a White House source tell me that's why the first few weeks he wouldn't stay there.
[01:57:28.865 --> 01:57:31.187]  They reportedly dug out hundreds of devices.
[01:57:32.486 --> 01:57:35.929]  Well, and then there's the bug-free room they've got in the White House, too.
[01:57:35.989 --> 01:57:46.458]  He can go into that room, which everything is carefully screened so that it's double-walled and there's no microphones and other things if he really wants to have a confidential conversation.
[01:57:46.479 --> 01:57:56.768]  But, of course, you don't have, you know, you don't bring foreign people from Russia into those inner sanctums of the White House, but there are protected rooms that you can get absolute secrecy.
[01:57:58.220 --> 01:57:58.420]  Wow.
[01:57:59.220 --> 01:58:02.522]  I want to ask you when we come back, but let's start getting on to the subject now.
[01:58:02.662 --> 01:58:03.342]  Seth Rich.
[01:58:03.842 --> 01:58:06.363]  I mean, WikiLeaks has all but said he was the source.
[01:58:06.803 --> 01:58:10.025]  Now we have these investigators, but some of those stories have gone back and forth.
[01:58:10.605 --> 01:58:13.926]  We've got Feds reportedly telling Fox News, no, we've seen it.
[01:58:13.966 --> 01:58:15.507]  He is one of the main WikiLeaks hackers.
[01:58:15.787 --> 01:58:16.187]  What do you think?
[01:58:17.165 --> 01:58:18.946]  Yeah, I think Seth Rich was removed.
[01:58:19.006 --> 01:58:21.727]  He was killed because he was disgruntled.
[01:58:21.787 --> 01:58:24.107]  He leaked to the WikiLeaks.
[01:58:24.147 --> 01:58:26.108]  He was the guy, and they took care of him.
[01:58:26.168 --> 01:58:28.729]  And boy, that sends a message to any potential other leakers.
[01:58:29.469 --> 01:58:32.710]  And we have a Podesta leak saying, I don't care if the person's innocent or not.
[01:58:33.050 --> 01:58:34.591]  I'm ready to make an example right now.
[01:58:36.432 --> 01:58:40.733]  That's in between their Russian dealings and the artwork of little kids on their walls making children.
[01:58:40.753 --> 01:58:42.093]  By the way, that's The Washington Post.
[01:58:42.334 --> 01:58:43.074]  We'll be back.
[01:58:43.094 --> 01:58:43.494]  Stay with us.

[01:59:51.676 --> 01:59:55.779]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:56.279 --> 01:59:57.640]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:11.589 --> 02:00:13.810]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:14.231 --> 02:00:15.651]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:15.972 --> 02:00:19.314]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:40.603]  I haven't gotten to it yet because I've been green-lighted to talk about a bunch of stuff I've been told the last week and I've been green-lighted by the White House and
[02:00:43.034 --> 02:00:49.896]  They're saying, go with it now, and that was an hour ago, and then I'm sitting here while I'm talking about this, and I'm trying to make sure that I talk to them.
[02:00:49.916 --> 02:00:55.377]  I haven't yet to find out exactly how I go with it, but that shows how frantic this has gotten.
[02:00:55.397 --> 02:00:59.518]  And yeah, the White House is in disarray.
[02:00:59.718 --> 02:01:03.519]  It's under attack from without, from within, but it's not Trump's fault.
[02:01:04.099 --> 02:01:07.300]  And I'm not here to worship Trump, but the thing is, you know a man by his enemies.
[02:01:07.600 --> 02:01:11.341]  The whole world system hates him because he's not an evil person.
[02:01:13.345 --> 02:01:23.728]  I used to think he was like super Machiavellian and actually his genius is almost like he's OCD in that he just does what he does and has his methodology and is not a bad guy and has a big work ethic.
[02:01:23.748 --> 02:01:39.433]  I'm not saying he's not really smart but the more I learn about Trump is he's so transparent that's what they're using against him in a way and I don't want him to be Machiavellian but then you see someone who isn't Machiavellian who just kind of instinctively does what he does and we think it's genius
[02:01:41.860 --> 02:01:43.281]  It's like almost idiot savant.
[02:01:43.301 --> 02:01:44.422]  What do you say to that, Joel Skousen?
[02:01:45.883 --> 02:01:47.225]  Well, I think you're absolutely right.
[02:01:47.785 --> 02:01:56.192]  Even though Trump has his faults, he has not led a moral life, still he is a basically good person.
[02:01:56.472 --> 02:01:57.353]  It comes through.
[02:01:57.373 --> 02:02:00.976]  I'm getting another broadcast coming through my audio, Alex.
[02:02:08.055 --> 02:02:09.155]  Yeah, that's on your computer.
[02:02:09.175 --> 02:02:10.256]  Something's up.
[02:02:10.316 --> 02:02:10.936]  It's okay, keep going.
[02:02:11.036 --> 02:02:11.696]  It's good radio.
[02:02:11.716 --> 02:02:14.817]  Oh, I think he muted it.
[02:02:15.817 --> 02:02:16.497]  Joel, did you fix that?
[02:02:20.659 --> 02:02:21.779]  Skype's a wonder, folks.
[02:02:23.039 --> 02:02:23.539]  Yes, you are.
[02:02:23.559 --> 02:02:24.360]  Can you hear me, Joel?
[02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:29.581]  Let me just shut down my browser here to stop that.
[02:02:32.765 --> 02:02:33.125]  It's okay.
[02:02:33.646 --> 02:02:34.966]  Whenever you want, we can go back to it.
[02:02:34.986 --> 02:02:36.847]  Whenever he wants to hear me, he can just shh.
[02:02:37.067 --> 02:02:37.848]  That happens to me sometimes.
[02:02:37.868 --> 02:02:44.512]  I'll be on a live broadcast, and like, you'll be on a CNN article, they're the worst, and an ad pops up playing something, and then it goes to the feed.
[02:02:45.012 --> 02:02:49.795]  So it's all part of the great transparentness here that we're projecting out into the world, exposing the globalists.
[02:02:50.115 --> 02:02:50.715]  Joel, are you back?
[02:02:51.395 --> 02:02:51.976]  Yes, I'm back.
[02:02:52.116 --> 02:02:52.616]  Okay, sorry.
[02:02:52.636 --> 02:02:54.277]  We're getting into the fact that he is genuine.
[02:02:54.777 --> 02:02:57.399]  That's why this world system tries to regurgitate him out.
[02:02:58.988 --> 02:03:06.317]  Well, you know, it just shows how intolerant they are of any possibility of any crack in their agenda being compromised.
[02:03:06.437 --> 02:03:16.770]  I mean, they are just apoplectic about Trump sharing, for example, the federal database so that he can actually document that there are millions of illegal owners on the voter rolls.
[02:03:17.310 --> 02:03:21.313]  I mean, they would love to impeach him over something, and they're building for that.
[02:03:21.894 --> 02:03:26.538]  There's an awful lot of traitorous Republicans that would go along with that impeachment thing.
[02:03:26.818 --> 02:03:32.162]  So far, nothing has arisen to that level, and I'm not sure it can happen anytime soon.
[02:03:32.202 --> 02:03:37.367]  But Trump probably is going to make a mistake that will get him into an impeachment.
[02:03:38.848 --> 02:03:46.593]  But the Deep State is literally apoplectic about the fact that we've got somebody we don't control in the White House.
[02:03:46.993 --> 02:03:59.060]  As I said during the Romney campaign, even though Romney was bending over backwards to please the establishment, hired all these globals from the CFR as advisors, he wasn't one of them and you can't have somebody in the White House.
[02:03:59.101 --> 02:04:00.842]  That's why Republicans and Democrats
[02:04:01.562 --> 02:04:03.143]  Came out to destroy Mitt Romney.
[02:04:03.183 --> 02:04:03.524]  That's right.
[02:04:03.544 --> 02:04:05.105]  They didn't have any dirt on him.
[02:04:05.145 --> 02:04:09.509]  Even though he wanted to be part of the establishment, they didn't have any dirt, so they didn't feel comfortable.
[02:04:10.570 --> 02:04:10.950]  That's right.
[02:04:11.711 --> 02:04:17.415]  And so now you've got somebody who is just utterly unpredictable, and he can turn on them in a minute.
[02:04:17.476 --> 02:04:27.944]  I mean, McMaster's is having real trouble with Donald Trump getting him to okay the increase in troops in Afghanistan, because Steve Bannon is actually saying to Trump, no, you don't want to do this.
[02:04:28.425 --> 02:04:29.766]  And that's why it hasn't happened yet.
[02:04:30.606 --> 02:04:33.248]  Oh, I had the leak over a month ago, point blank, directly from Trump.
[02:04:33.268 --> 02:04:33.989]  I'll just leave it at that.
[02:04:34.349 --> 02:04:35.610]  It's not happening, don't worry.
[02:04:35.670 --> 02:04:38.972]  And then, three days later, he came out and gave a speech, and then he hasn't allowed it so far.
[02:04:39.293 --> 02:04:42.875]  And it just shows how out of control this entire group he's got under him is.
[02:04:43.175 --> 02:04:44.156]  I think Colonel Schaeffer's right.
[02:04:44.196 --> 02:04:47.999]  He fires people two, three levels down and replaces them right now with loyalists.
[02:04:49.900 --> 02:04:50.080]  Right.
[02:04:51.161 --> 02:04:54.143]  WorldAffairsBrief.com, folks who subscribe there or read the daily briefings.
[02:04:54.563 --> 02:04:57.505]  Joel, thank you always for your great commentary and piercing analysis.
[02:04:57.826 --> 02:04:59.307]  God bless you, and we'll be following your work.
[02:05:00.026 --> 02:05:01.026]  Thank you very much.
[02:05:01.086 --> 02:05:02.687]  Seth Rich is back in the news.
[02:05:02.727 --> 02:05:03.327]  You remember him.
[02:05:03.387 --> 02:05:07.409]  He was the DC staffer who was shot in the back, but nothing was stolen from him.
[02:05:07.609 --> 02:05:13.971]  Most people think he is the source of the DNC leaks that ended up on WikiLeaks last year during the 2016 presidential campaign.
[02:05:14.111 --> 02:05:21.294]  Enter Rod Wheeler, a former DC police homicide detective hired by the family to run a parallel investigation into Seth's mysterious death.
[02:05:21.414 --> 02:05:30.560]  Wheeler told Fox 5 DC, I have a source inside the police department that has looked me straight in the eye and said, Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can't share any information with you.
[02:05:30.620 --> 02:05:34.562]  Now that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department.
[02:05:34.602 --> 02:05:40.426]  When asked if there's information that links Seth Rich to WikiLeaks, Wheeler replied, absolutely, yeah, that's confirmed.
[02:05:40.566 --> 02:05:43.808]  Now of course the DC police are saying, oh no, there's no cover up.
[02:05:43.848 --> 02:05:46.910]  Neither they nor the FBI have been helping Wheeler out in this case.
[02:05:47.230 --> 02:05:53.094]  Alex Jones broke all this down in a video back in August of 2016 titled, Does Assange Have Proof of Clinton Murder?
[02:05:53.174 --> 02:05:55.715]  Hashtag Seth Rich is trending on Twitter.
[02:05:55.775 --> 02:05:57.476]  Let's see how long it takes him to bury it.

[02:08:04.822 --> 02:08:06.804]  We are on the march.
[02:08:06.864 --> 02:08:09.846]  The empire is on the run.
[02:08:09.866 --> 02:08:16.110]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.552 --> 02:08:25.737]  Man, I was watching during the breaks this intriguing press conference Putin gave in the middle of the night here, but I guess in the afternoon there or whatever.
[02:08:28.170 --> 02:08:35.716]  And they were just laying out how ridiculous this whole narrative that Russia runs this and how they're trying to destabilize the government here in the United States.
[02:08:35.756 --> 02:08:37.998]  Now there's a whole psyop against our president.
[02:08:38.038 --> 02:08:40.700]  And then I see Colonel Schaefer at Total Patriot saying the same thing.
[02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:46.624]  And then I see Dana Bash who hates Trump admitting, oh yeah, we're going to bring you down with Deep State.
[02:08:47.285 --> 02:08:54.010]  With bureaucrats in the meeting lying and saying that Trump's giving them secrets in the meeting when none of it's even true.
[02:08:55.511 --> 02:08:57.473]  And then leaking secrets themselves.
[02:09:01.408 --> 02:09:05.231]  of secret stuff so they can sit there and try to burn the president.
[02:09:05.791 --> 02:09:08.212]  And it just makes me ask, how much more desperate will they get?
[02:09:08.493 --> 02:09:09.653]  They tried to steal the election.
[02:09:10.674 --> 02:09:13.036]  They got caught in the WikiLeaks, thanks to Seth Rich and others.
[02:09:13.596 --> 02:09:15.277]  And now they're in full panic mode.
[02:09:16.698 --> 02:09:19.200]  Don't you guys get globalisms out in the open now?
[02:09:19.460 --> 02:09:21.161]  Your New World Order is openly exposed.
[02:09:21.641 --> 02:09:25.204]  Don't you understand now that it just gets harder for you to roll the
[02:09:26.559 --> 02:09:27.439]  Boulder uphill.
[02:09:27.799 --> 02:09:29.360]  We now have the high ground.
[02:09:29.420 --> 02:09:30.380]  We have the initiative.
[02:09:30.800 --> 02:09:31.781]  The people are aware of you.
[02:09:31.841 --> 02:09:35.762]  I don't say that to get myself on some power trip or convince myself I'm winning.
[02:09:35.822 --> 02:09:36.642]  I'm never that guy.
[02:09:37.723 --> 02:09:39.984]  I understand historically we're beginning to win.
[02:09:40.884 --> 02:09:44.565]  The other CNN host has an on-air meltdown versus Navy SEAL.
[02:09:44.905 --> 02:09:47.566]  You can't attack CNN reporting our sources are perfect.
[02:09:47.946 --> 02:09:49.667]  CNN is a cesspool.
[02:09:50.675 --> 02:09:52.777]  BuzzFeed, admittedly, just makes up their sources.
[02:09:52.817 --> 02:09:57.521]  This is all, it's in the WikiLeaks that CNN makes up stuff and rigs everything.
[02:09:58.121 --> 02:10:01.044]  So Owen Schroer is our guest, co-hosting for the Balance of the Hour.
[02:10:01.424 --> 02:10:03.166]  Dr. Corsi's popping in.
[02:10:03.686 --> 02:10:04.887]  Did we get Mike Cernovich to pop in?
[02:10:06.809 --> 02:10:08.210]  Yes, we got a bunch of people in this hour.
[02:10:08.230 --> 02:10:09.451]  It's going to be a big smorgasbord.
[02:10:09.731 --> 02:10:10.412]  That's great.
[02:10:10.512 --> 02:10:14.395]  Mike Cernovich is just totally trolling all the mainstream media in Washington right now.
[02:10:14.455 --> 02:10:14.956]  It's amazing.
[02:10:17.456 --> 02:10:18.057]  Absolutely.
[02:10:18.197 --> 02:10:24.580]  By the way, New York Times and Washington Post covered Obama's leaks all the time, but I never heard anyone calling for impeachment then.
[02:10:25.381 --> 02:10:26.281]  What's up with that, Alex?
[02:10:26.542 --> 02:10:28.042]  Obama was allowed to leak whatever he wanted.
[02:10:28.062 --> 02:10:29.263]  Yeah, how come that goes on?
[02:10:29.523 --> 02:10:34.546]  He was allowed to order the borders completely wide open outside of law, but that was okay.
[02:10:35.187 --> 02:10:40.330]  And obviously he was there telling the Justice Department people not to go after the Clintons and himself for all their crimes.
[02:10:41.050 --> 02:10:43.831]  Alex, I was really happy the way you opened the show today.
[02:10:44.051 --> 02:10:49.513]  It was exactly what needed to be said, because people need to understand that we are in a civil war.
[02:10:49.793 --> 02:10:50.534]  That's not rhetoric.
[02:10:50.574 --> 02:10:53.094]  That's not you up here saying, oh, civil war, everybody free.
[02:10:53.455 --> 02:10:58.677]  No, this is actually going on, and the people we're fighting are literal trash.
[02:10:58.937 --> 02:10:59.577]  And whether you like
[02:11:00.037 --> 02:11:02.919]  President Donald Trump or not, he's the one fighting for America.
[02:11:03.379 --> 02:11:04.059]  That's just a fact.
[02:11:04.079 --> 02:11:06.841]  And if they bring him down, I thought everybody likes underdogs.
[02:11:07.221 --> 02:11:09.743]  He has good policies and everybody's ganged up on him.
[02:11:10.143 --> 02:11:11.243]  How could you, and then us.
[02:11:11.944 --> 02:11:15.106]  So here's the deal, can you imagine, let me ask you this, what happens if they bring Trump down?
[02:11:15.126 --> 02:11:22.670]  Well they say, they're going to remove all the Republicans that were elected in the last election, we're all going to be Russian agents, and they're going to have Deep State come after everybody, and we're not going to just roll over to that.
[02:11:23.110 --> 02:11:26.473]  So, and that's why the real deep state doesn't want this.
[02:11:26.893 --> 02:11:29.316]  They're like, we'd like our pension funds to still be good.
[02:11:29.396 --> 02:11:32.939]  I mean, anybody who's sane, but see the left isn't sane, are they?
[02:11:33.888 --> 02:11:34.369]  Well, no.
[02:11:34.549 --> 02:11:36.631]  They have complete double thinking, double standards.
[02:11:36.951 --> 02:11:38.393]  That's been exposed time and time again.
[02:11:38.413 --> 02:11:46.381]  And what I'm worried about is this tight news cycle that we're in now, where you're going to have five massive stories breaking in a 24-hour span.
[02:11:46.481 --> 02:11:48.864]  And it comes out that he didn't give out the laptop info.
[02:11:48.884 --> 02:11:49.504]  That was already public.
[02:11:49.565 --> 02:11:52.488]  Oh, we've already jumped to, you told Comey not to investigate.
[02:11:52.508 --> 02:11:55.611]  Then they've already jumped to, they already just jumped to the next BS.
[02:11:55.711 --> 02:11:56.691]  So your head is spinning.
[02:11:56.711 --> 02:11:58.332]  You've got multiple members of the U.S.
[02:11:58.372 --> 02:12:01.414]  government on the floor today crying for impeachment.
[02:12:01.494 --> 02:12:02.534]  We'll get to that in a second.
[02:12:02.554 --> 02:12:04.135]  But what I'm worried about... Oh yeah, we have those clips.
[02:12:04.195 --> 02:12:05.575]  Big, big, big battles on the floor.
[02:12:06.376 --> 02:12:07.696]  And this is the Civil War.
[02:12:07.997 --> 02:12:09.857]  And so what I'm worried about... Trump has to go full offense.
[02:12:11.198 --> 02:12:12.539]  Here's what we're going to do, Alex.
[02:12:12.759 --> 02:12:19.803]  Just like we did in the presidential election of 2016, we're going to win in 2018.
[02:12:19.883 --> 02:12:21.684]  We're going to get our people in.
[02:12:21.704 --> 02:12:22.784]  And that's why they're panicking.
[02:12:22.804 --> 02:12:33.850]  They want to declare all opposition to not teaching your kid how to be a tranny at age 5, and all opposition to not taking vaccines, and all opposition to not having open borders and free anchor babies, and all opposition to having one-sided trade deals with China.
[02:12:34.110 --> 02:12:36.311]  And all opposition to not having communist justices.
[02:12:36.731 --> 02:12:38.492]  That's all going to be called Russian now.
[02:12:38.532 --> 02:12:39.312]  We see where it's going.
[02:12:39.552 --> 02:12:46.695]  They want an authoritarian move against us, and thank God the founders put in that time bomb of defense, the Second Amendment.
[02:12:47.035 --> 02:12:55.698]  So I'm concerned that they see this narrow window, that they think that they may have any political mandate to actually go through impeachment or anything.
[02:12:57.279 --> 02:12:57.980]  Here's what it's going to take.
[02:12:58.060 --> 02:12:59.080]  I have a list today, Alex.
[02:12:59.100 --> 02:13:04.805]  I don't know if you want me to go down this list, but I have a short list here of all the swamp members that need to be drained in 2018.
[02:13:05.405 --> 02:13:07.266]  Let's expose the traitors, the enemies.
[02:13:07.527 --> 02:13:09.408]  Let's start with, how about one out of Texas?
[02:13:09.448 --> 02:13:17.374]  He was on the floor today calling for Trump to be impeached, and that is a representative from the 9th congressional district here in Texas, down in Houston.
[02:13:18.014 --> 02:13:18.874]  Al Green.
[02:13:19.315 --> 02:13:21.135]  Al Green is a swamp creature.
[02:13:21.435 --> 02:13:23.656]  He needs to be ousted.
[02:13:23.796 --> 02:13:26.257]  And that is up to the people getting out.
[02:13:26.437 --> 02:13:28.478]  We got the swamp lord, Maxine Waters.
[02:13:28.618 --> 02:13:31.819]  Now this is the best example here with Maxine Waters.
[02:13:32.659 --> 02:13:33.659]  Look at Al Green.
[02:13:33.899 --> 02:13:34.880]  So there's Al Green, yeah.
[02:13:37.841 --> 02:13:39.481]  That's a swamp creature right there.
[02:13:39.561 --> 02:13:41.042]  What is up with that face right there?
[02:13:41.062 --> 02:13:42.382]  This is a smile, Alex.
[02:13:47.378 --> 02:13:50.380]  Anyway, here's the big point about Maxine Waters.
[02:13:50.881 --> 02:13:57.786]  What's happening, and this is what needs to happen, is Omar Navarro, who is running against Maxine Waters, is actually on the ground running right now.
[02:13:58.446 --> 02:14:02.549]  On Monday, he did an announcement that he was running against Maxine Waters.
[02:14:02.569 --> 02:14:03.250]  You know where he did it?
[02:14:03.630 --> 02:14:05.231]  Outside of Maxine Waters' $4.3 million mansion.
[02:14:05.251 --> 02:14:05.331]  Okay?
[02:14:08.709 --> 02:14:09.710]  All kinds of media was there.
[02:14:09.730 --> 02:14:11.111]  He had a mariachi band there.
[02:14:11.251 --> 02:14:12.572]  And they called for her to be deported.
[02:14:12.732 --> 02:14:13.512]  They called for her to be deported.
[02:14:13.552 --> 02:14:15.293]  How can you not like a mariachi band?
[02:14:15.614 --> 02:14:16.854]  So he's out here making the announcement.
[02:14:16.875 --> 02:14:17.975]  You know where Maxine Waters is?
[02:14:18.035 --> 02:14:22.718]  Well, no, she's not at her $4.3 million mansion in Hancock County, not where she represents.
[02:14:23.019 --> 02:14:26.861]  No, she's not in the districts where she represents that are ongoing with poverty and homelessness.
[02:14:27.181 --> 02:14:28.182]  She's in Washington.
[02:14:28.442 --> 02:14:31.644]  She's on the mainstream news calling for Trump's impeachment.
[02:14:31.684 --> 02:14:33.125]  Hey, can we get Navarro on the show?
[02:14:33.446 --> 02:14:35.047]  Absolutely, we can get Omar Navarro on the show.
[02:14:35.067 --> 02:14:35.687]  You want to interview him?
[02:14:36.007 --> 02:14:36.508]  Absolutely.
[02:14:36.528 --> 02:14:37.909]  He's actually a huge fan of yours, Alex.
[02:14:37.949 --> 02:14:38.609]  He'd love to talk to you.
[02:14:39.069 --> 02:14:40.710]  So he's actually hitting the ground running.
[02:14:40.930 --> 02:14:42.512]  He's going to defeat Maxine Waters.
[02:14:42.732 --> 02:14:45.714]  If you want to see how to defeat the Swamp, look at what Omar Nawal is doing.
[02:14:45.754 --> 02:14:45.974]  No, I agree.
[02:14:46.054 --> 02:14:47.255]  In fact, I meant to get to that.
[02:14:47.515 --> 02:14:48.996]  We've known the past, the present, the future.
[02:14:49.396 --> 02:14:50.497]  Everybody runs for office.
[02:14:50.557 --> 02:14:51.417]  Everybody calls C-SPAN.
[02:14:51.437 --> 02:14:52.438]  Everybody calls Talk Radio.
[02:14:52.718 --> 02:14:54.679]  Everybody supports Talk Radio because they're trying to kill it.
[02:14:54.919 --> 02:14:55.700]  Everybody supports M4s.
[02:14:55.780 --> 02:14:57.181]  Everybody prays for liberty.
[02:14:57.441 --> 02:14:58.382]  Everybody tells the truth.
[02:14:58.742 --> 02:15:05.967]  Everybody, whether you're black, white, Hispanic, you can get somebody else of another color, take them to a barbecue, take them out shooting, get past all this race crap, and come together
[02:15:06.847 --> 02:15:21.431]  And just absolutely back Donald Trump, because again, they've said in the deep state announcements, in the major publications, they're going to try to quote, suspend Congress and have the deep state have new elections that Homeland Security runs.
[02:15:21.831 --> 02:15:23.792]  Can you say staged election, total takeover?
[02:15:24.092 --> 02:15:26.093]  They're planning a Venezuela-style takeover.
[02:15:26.333 --> 02:15:27.433]  It's not going to happen!
[02:15:27.773 --> 02:15:30.914]  My God, they're led by Nancy Pelosi who doesn't even know that Bush isn't in office!
[02:15:31.374 --> 02:15:34.336]  Well, and you know that I've had times where I had reservations about Trump.
[02:15:34.396 --> 02:15:34.996]  I'm full bore.
[02:15:35.036 --> 02:15:35.937]  I'm back on the Trump train.
[02:15:35.957 --> 02:15:39.819]  The more they attack him, the more that legitimizes him to me as the president.
[02:15:40.119 --> 02:15:40.699]  How about this though?
[02:15:40.719 --> 02:15:41.200]  You'll love this.
[02:15:41.300 --> 02:15:45.242]  Elizabeth Warren, okay, she's coming up as a senator in Massachusetts.
[02:15:45.262 --> 02:15:46.223]  You know who's running against her?
[02:15:46.903 --> 02:15:49.786]  Shiva, this is a guy I can't pronounce his last name, I'm not going to try it.
[02:15:49.886 --> 02:15:51.588]  Shiva, Fight for America, U.S.
[02:15:51.928 --> 02:15:57.133]  Senator, his campaign slogan, Defeat Fake Indian Elizabeth Warren.
[02:15:57.273 --> 02:16:03.580]  This is an actual Indian, he's from India, he's a private businessman, he says that he's an inventor.
[02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:06.743]  I love it because he's Native American and he's an actual Indian.
[02:16:06.983 --> 02:16:09.406]  So fight, get the real, and here's the thing.
[02:16:10.516 --> 02:16:11.877]  Again, this is another guy who's running.
[02:16:11.957 --> 02:16:12.838]  I'm not seeing anyone else.
[02:16:12.858 --> 02:16:13.538]  Here's some other people.
[02:16:13.618 --> 02:16:17.902]  Dianne Feinstein, nobody's pressing her right now in the Senate in California.
[02:16:18.542 --> 02:16:22.685]  The 12th District, Nancy Pelosi in San Francisco, nobody's pressing her right now.
[02:16:22.765 --> 02:16:23.426]  Come on, people.
[02:16:23.686 --> 02:16:25.827]  28th District in California, Adam Schiff.
[02:16:25.907 --> 02:16:27.308]  I know that you know who that guy is.
[02:16:27.529 --> 02:16:28.429]  Somebody press him.
[02:16:28.930 --> 02:16:30.151]  26th District, Julia Brown.
[02:16:30.191 --> 02:16:30.611]  Absolutely.
[02:16:31.051 --> 02:16:32.973]  He's reached the shield generator.
[02:16:33.253 --> 02:16:34.635]  Target maximum firepower.
[02:16:34.655 --> 02:16:37.637]  This is who's fighting in the 26th district right now of California.
[02:16:38.058 --> 02:16:40.100]  Antonio Sabato Jr.
[02:16:40.580 --> 02:16:45.705]  They say we're racist, but there's a Latino, again, two of them now running as conservatives in California.
[02:16:46.105 --> 02:16:47.467]  This is how we drain the swamp.
[02:16:48.167 --> 02:16:52.050]  Rhode Island, Sheldon White House, this guy calls for Trump's impeachment every day.
[02:16:52.070 --> 02:16:52.650]  He's a senator.
[02:16:52.670 --> 02:16:53.371]  Yeah, but what is it?
[02:16:53.431 --> 02:16:56.132]  If it's a white Democrat, they look really ugly and stupid.
[02:16:56.152 --> 02:16:58.214]  If it's a Hispanic Democrat, they look ugly and stupid.
[02:16:58.514 --> 02:17:01.976]  Or a black Democrat, it's like all the conservative blacks look sharp and cool.
[02:17:02.036 --> 02:17:04.237]  All the conservative Latinos look sharp and cool.
[02:17:05.178 --> 02:17:06.679]  All the white conservatives look better.
[02:17:06.919 --> 02:17:07.940]  Why are liberals ugly?
[02:17:09.862 --> 02:17:10.703]  Actually, it's funny, Alex.
[02:17:10.743 --> 02:17:11.363]  I have a story.
[02:17:11.383 --> 02:17:12.123]  No, I'm serious!
[02:17:12.203 --> 02:17:13.264]  No, I'm serious, too!
[02:17:13.304 --> 02:17:13.904]  I mean, I've seen it!
[02:17:13.924 --> 02:17:14.605]  I'm going to tell you.
[02:17:15.045 --> 02:17:20.088]  The liberals right now are truly in a disaster, Alex.
[02:17:20.128 --> 02:17:23.529]  They are honestly in a mental and psychological... That's right.
[02:17:23.549 --> 02:17:26.551]  Their party's imploding, so their answer is, declare us all Russians.
[02:17:26.631 --> 02:17:30.993]  I mean, look, if you're a crazy person, you're going to look like a crazy person.
[02:17:31.013 --> 02:17:32.614]  You're going to look like George Soros.
[02:17:32.634 --> 02:17:34.495]  You're going to look like... Chuckie Schumer.
[02:17:34.515 --> 02:17:35.276]  You're going to look like...
[02:17:36.902 --> 02:17:40.606]  It goes on and on, or Trigglypuff, or these people, or Michael Moore.
[02:17:40.987 --> 02:17:46.693]  Alex, I had a crazy experience over the weekend dealing with liberals, which by the way... I mean, here's Schumer!
[02:17:47.734 --> 02:17:48.435]  Literally, though!
[02:17:48.555 --> 02:17:50.557]  He looked like... Nosferatu!
[02:17:50.697 --> 02:17:51.298]  Ah, your blood!
[02:17:53.180 --> 02:17:57.823]  If you walked into a deli and you saw Chuck Schumer slicing pastrami... No, I'm walking out.
[02:17:57.883 --> 02:17:59.384]  Exactly, you'd walk right back out.
[02:17:59.704 --> 02:18:02.766]  But Alex, I had a crazy experience with a couple liberals this weekend.
[02:18:03.106 --> 02:18:06.928]  And by the way, you're worse than Glenn Beck, so congratulations to the liberals, you're now worse than Glenn Beck.
[02:18:07.429 --> 02:18:08.089]  Thank God!
[02:18:08.249 --> 02:18:08.990]  But here's the thing.
[02:18:10.531 --> 02:18:13.473]  As the night goes on, Alex, this is a true story.
[02:18:13.973 --> 02:18:21.458]  These two liberals, these two liberal women, okay, that they hate you, they can't believe that President Trump, I mean, you know, the full standard, what you would expect.
[02:18:21.999 --> 02:18:23.823]  Alex, this is how much of a disaster they are.
[02:18:24.164 --> 02:18:28.515]  By the end of the night, both of them ended up fighting with each other and crying and going home.
[02:18:29.502 --> 02:18:31.684]  Well, you were telling me... These people are a mental disaster.
[02:18:31.704 --> 02:18:34.406]  There's good-looking women everywhere, but they're basket-case liberals.
[02:18:35.126 --> 02:18:36.468]  It's the wildest thing I've ever seen.
[02:18:36.488 --> 02:18:38.489]  Meanwhile, a conservative libertarian woman is super fun.
[02:18:39.010 --> 02:18:42.112]  They're fun, they're down-to-earth, they can have a good time, they can have a laugh, you know?
[02:18:42.172 --> 02:18:45.555]  It's not like they're, look, oh my gosh, what is this guy looking at me about?
[02:18:46.095 --> 02:18:46.596]  Oh my gosh.
[02:18:46.636 --> 02:18:52.860]  Oh, we've had, you know, when I was divorced a while, I'm married now, I go to parties and stuff, and liberal women will walk over.
[02:18:53.681 --> 02:18:56.464]  And like, be like, I just want you to know I'm not having sex with you.
[02:18:56.484 --> 02:18:57.726]  And I'd be like, what the hell are you talking about?
[02:18:57.746 --> 02:18:58.287]  Are you crazy?
[02:18:58.327 --> 02:18:59.168]  That's the first thing.
[02:18:59.248 --> 02:19:00.449]  It's like, we're desperate.
[02:19:00.649 --> 02:19:01.370]  Oh, it's a woman!
[02:19:01.390 --> 02:19:02.531]  Let me have sex with you right now!
[02:19:03.753 --> 02:19:04.894]  Meanwhile, they're hitting on you that way.
[02:19:04.914 --> 02:19:05.915]  You're like, get away from me, lunatic.
[02:19:06.176 --> 02:19:08.178]  Or I was wearing a captain's hat at a Halloween party.
[02:19:08.598 --> 02:19:10.160]  I had people walking over going, are you a Nazi?
[02:19:10.240 --> 02:19:10.461]  Yeah.
[02:19:10.681 --> 02:19:12.203]  And it was all weird white people doing it.
[02:19:12.543 --> 02:19:14.044]  Well, so here's what's going to happen.
[02:19:14.124 --> 02:19:18.506]  Those people are going to be fewer and more far between as we go on here.
[02:19:18.546 --> 02:19:21.088]  They don't have control over the country anymore.
[02:19:21.128 --> 02:19:22.388]  They don't have control over the polls anymore.
[02:19:22.408 --> 02:19:22.989]  They're not having kids.
[02:19:23.309 --> 02:19:23.929]  They're losers.
[02:19:24.349 --> 02:19:29.632]  And if we start having their losers, their leaders, losing in elections, then they have nothing.
[02:19:29.892 --> 02:19:34.195]  Maxine Waters, Auntie Maxine, the queen of the millennials right now, what are they going to do when she's gone?
[02:19:34.215 --> 02:19:34.795]  Stay woke!
[02:19:34.815 --> 02:19:37.096]  I'm a millennial!
[02:19:37.536 --> 02:19:38.197]  Stay woke!
[02:19:39.198 --> 02:19:41.240]  Meanwhile, that Putin invaded Korea.
[02:19:41.360 --> 02:19:43.381]  Here you go, Justin Amash.
[02:19:43.521 --> 02:19:43.902]  Amash?
[02:19:43.942 --> 02:19:44.662]  What?
[02:19:45.003 --> 02:19:45.263]  Sorry.
[02:19:45.363 --> 02:19:49.066]  Justin Amash, the first Republican today in Michigan's third congressional district.
[02:19:49.106 --> 02:19:50.907]  Justin Amash called for impeachment today.
[02:19:51.027 --> 02:19:51.768]  First Republican.
[02:19:52.508 --> 02:19:53.429]  Drain that swamp!
[02:19:53.549 --> 02:19:55.331]  Oh, I've always thought Amash is a weasel.
[02:19:55.511 --> 02:19:56.472]  He ran on a Ron Paul ticket.
[02:19:56.492 --> 02:19:57.132]  He looks like a weasel.
[02:19:57.232 --> 02:19:57.973]  Oh, I don't... Amash.
[02:20:00.435 --> 02:20:04.298]  I want to tell you about some of the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:20:04.318 --> 02:20:06.180]  We are under constant attack.
[02:20:06.680 --> 02:20:08.882]  You know it by now from the mainstream media.
[02:20:09.082 --> 02:20:11.964]  They're trying to attack us on every level.
[02:20:12.005 --> 02:20:26.337]  Now with the YouTube scandal, they're demonetizing our channels, which again takes a huge chunk out of our income, which is why we always appreciate and rely on you getting the products because that's how we stay afloat.
[02:20:27.017 --> 02:20:28.637]  They can't get to us that way.
[02:20:29.018 --> 02:20:31.838]  They can't pressure you to not buy the products.
[02:20:31.878 --> 02:20:32.839]  They don't have that power.
[02:20:32.859 --> 02:20:35.859]  And that's why you're the key to this entire operation.
[02:20:36.199 --> 02:20:38.600]  We have Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste.
[02:20:39.060 --> 02:20:41.901]  Bubblegum flavor just arrived at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:20:41.921 --> 02:20:43.541]  This is by listener request.
[02:20:43.781 --> 02:20:49.023]  Bubblegum flavored Super Blue toothpaste now available at Infowarsstore.com in limited supply.
[02:20:49.043 --> 02:20:53.904]  Again, if you're not using fluoride-free toothpaste by now,
[02:20:54.784 --> 02:20:56.105]  You're absolutely insane.
[02:20:56.525 --> 02:21:00.826]  Harvard studies, it reduces IQ, it causes bone cancer.
[02:21:01.427 --> 02:21:06.548]  It's not great, let's just put it that way, and I've been using it for about, what, 15 years now?
[02:21:07.309 --> 02:21:10.030]  So, you're gonna buy it anyway, why not buy it from us?
[02:21:10.050 --> 02:21:15.872]  It's in limited supply, but it is available at infowarsstore.com with the new bubblegum flavor.
[02:21:16.452 --> 02:21:28.495]  Super blue fluoride free toothpaste and it supports this network which is under constant demonization and attack because we don't take big fat checks from George Soros.
[02:21:28.795 --> 02:21:31.616]  We don't get put on extremist lists even though they want us to.
[02:21:31.656 --> 02:21:33.676]  That's how they're taking away the YouTube money.
[02:21:34.036 --> 02:21:45.479]  That's why we need your support more than ever because we're not funded by giant corporations who are now pulling the plug on YouTube as they move it into a TV thing, a Netflix model.
[02:21:46.120 --> 02:21:51.629]  To drown out independent voices, so support us by getting the products at Infowarsstore.com
[02:22:00.489 --> 02:22:12.174]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:22:12.754 --> 02:22:14.815]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[02:22:15.015 --> 02:22:17.836]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:22:18.276 --> 02:22:19.477]  It's made in the USA.
[02:22:20.217 --> 02:22:28.605]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the InfoWars.
[02:22:28.945 --> 02:22:30.907]  It is a classical 360 win.
[02:22:31.407 --> 02:22:35.191]  Our formula at InfoWarsLife.com is quite frankly simple.
[02:22:35.892 --> 02:22:42.438]  We go out and look at the recognized research and we take it to the next level of quality, of purity,
[02:22:43.630 --> 02:22:44.331]  And of strength.
[02:22:45.291 --> 02:22:48.674]  Because this is what I personally use for myself and my family.
[02:22:49.094 --> 02:22:56.679]  We've gone through five or six different permutations in the last four years, since we launched InfoWars Live, to actually come up with this.
[02:22:57.460 --> 02:23:08.688]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:23:08.928 --> 02:23:23.385]  If you're not mitigating the pesticides, the heavy metals, the chemicals, if you're not trying to purify your water, if you're not trying to take products like Z-Shield that are full of known concentrated compounds that'll purify our cells and our bodies, you're crazy.
[02:23:23.865 --> 02:23:24.606]  You owe it to yourself.
[02:23:25.367 --> 02:23:35.194]  You owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[02:23:35.255 --> 02:23:43.521]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:23:43.721 --> 02:23:50.466]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the new world order.
[02:23:51.460 --> 02:23:55.223]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[02:23:55.703 --> 02:24:00.066]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:24:10.973 --> 02:24:15.916]  Coming up, Mike Cernovich has got breaking news in the next segment, and Dr. Corsi as well.
[02:24:16.516 --> 02:24:20.179]  InfoWars.com has some of the breaking news and battle plans.
[02:24:21.477 --> 02:24:22.297]  Defeat the globalists.
[02:24:24.218 --> 02:24:27.760]  We do have a clip of Putin we're going to be playing here again at the start of the next segment.
[02:24:28.521 --> 02:24:32.643]  But continuing with the swamp creatures, their party lost everywhere.
[02:24:33.143 --> 02:24:38.325]  The claims that the Russians are the reason that they lost, that's not holding water anywhere.
[02:24:38.766 --> 02:24:47.210]  But the deep state continues to push this, and now we've got some Republicans, like Justin Amash, who needs to walk the plank out of conservatism.
[02:24:48.211 --> 02:24:52.173]  Go out the airlock and join the Democrats, the Liberals, for himself.
[02:24:52.613 --> 02:24:55.295]  Yeah, I think it's time to blow the airlock, to drain the swamp.
[02:24:55.335 --> 02:24:57.776]  You know, it takes a couple seconds for that drain.
[02:24:58.256 --> 02:24:59.257]  You blow that airlock...
[02:25:00.250 --> 02:25:00.590]  They're out.
[02:25:00.710 --> 02:25:01.491]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:25:01.511 --> 02:25:02.851]  Just blow the airlock.
[02:25:02.911 --> 02:25:03.792]  Get these people out.
[02:25:04.112 --> 02:25:04.973]  But it is up to us.
[02:25:05.033 --> 02:25:06.433]  We need to help President Trump.
[02:25:06.453 --> 02:25:10.756]  Again, what can I do about a bunch of dumbass liberals out in the street protesting?
[02:25:10.776 --> 02:25:11.256]  You know what?
[02:25:11.456 --> 02:25:12.217]  Probably nothing.
[02:25:12.497 --> 02:25:17.740]  But if they don't have any pull in Congress, if they don't have any leaders in the Senate, then they have no say.
[02:25:17.780 --> 02:25:18.540]  They have no voice.
[02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:21.422]  They're just losers, just like their leading politicians.
[02:25:21.462 --> 02:25:23.263]  So that's why we need to drain the swamp.
[02:25:23.643 --> 02:25:25.884]  That's why we need people to run like Omar Navarro.
[02:25:26.164 --> 02:25:26.985]  That's why we need them
[02:25:27.745 --> 02:25:33.289]  People like Shiva, people like Sabato Jr., we need these people to hit the ground running hard now.
[02:25:33.569 --> 02:25:35.250]  We need to start pressing now.
[02:25:35.330 --> 02:25:37.212]  We need to start getting these people out now.
[02:25:37.252 --> 02:25:47.178]  We need to ensure victory now so that A, they can't steal it with a total rig job, but that B, we already have the mandate going in just like President Trump had.
[02:25:47.419 --> 02:25:50.821]  Let's recall, President Trump was already president before he won the election.
[02:25:51.061 --> 02:25:52.602]  He was already meeting with foreign leaders.
[02:25:52.842 --> 02:25:54.083]  He was already making moves.
[02:25:54.343 --> 02:25:55.783]  Businesses were already returning.
[02:25:56.084 --> 02:25:57.564]  That's the mandate that we can have again.
[02:25:57.584 --> 02:25:57.804]  Exactly.
[02:25:57.864 --> 02:26:02.287]  Instead of just running as normal candidates, meet with people and talk about what you're going to do once you're congressman.
[02:26:02.427 --> 02:26:05.908]  And that's what Omar Navarro is doing, and that's why I'm saying he is paving the way right now.
[02:26:05.928 --> 02:26:06.629]  I couldn't be more proud.
[02:26:06.669 --> 02:26:07.549]  He's my age.
[02:26:08.029 --> 02:26:08.490]  We need good people.
[02:26:08.510 --> 02:26:10.471]  He's protesting outside our house.
[02:26:10.511 --> 02:26:11.271]  Yeah, he goes outside.
[02:26:11.291 --> 02:26:13.452]  We need good people to run for office, okay?
[02:26:13.732 --> 02:26:17.394]  We need well-meaning people who care about other people in their district.
[02:26:17.654 --> 02:26:19.015]  I agree, but let's expand on that.
[02:26:19.415 --> 02:26:21.938]  You wanted to get into going out to the night and running into zombies everywhere.
[02:26:22.718 --> 02:26:28.905]  So, it's just, Alex, I'm deathly scared of, like, the herd mentality.
[02:26:29.085 --> 02:26:30.106]  Millennials are into that.
[02:26:30.386 --> 02:26:35.031]  And it's so palpable now, more than ever, because, and it's been so exposed.
[02:26:35.511 --> 02:26:36.092]  It doesn't matter.
[02:26:36.112 --> 02:26:36.732]  Here's what could happen.
[02:26:36.753 --> 02:26:38.074]  Are you in the herd or you're not in the herd?
[02:26:38.334 --> 02:26:41.157]  Well, and this is the thing I talked to Mike Cernovich about one time, too.
[02:26:41.197 --> 02:26:45.160]  It's like, you can see the difference, you know, on the conservative end of the spectrum.
[02:26:45.561 --> 02:26:46.842]  We have some disagreements.
[02:26:46.882 --> 02:26:48.123]  We see some different angles.
[02:26:48.183 --> 02:26:50.465]  You know, maybe we have different things we think are more important.
[02:26:50.785 --> 02:26:51.887]  But we're all on the same team.
[02:26:51.927 --> 02:26:53.328]  We all want to move the ball forward.
[02:26:53.608 --> 02:26:55.990]  We just maybe have a different idea of how we might get there.
[02:26:56.170 --> 02:26:57.372]  But we're still all on the same team.
[02:26:57.952 --> 02:27:00.315]  For them, there is no individualism.
[02:27:00.355 --> 02:27:01.657]  There is no individual think.
[02:27:01.677 --> 02:27:02.998]  There is no discernment.
[02:27:03.379 --> 02:27:08.485]  It's just herd think, herd mentality, and it's been so proven by anything Trump does is bad.
[02:27:08.505 --> 02:27:09.766]  This is what would happen, Alex, okay?
[02:27:10.647 --> 02:27:12.249]  Trump could save a hundred...
[02:27:13.166 --> 02:27:13.426]  I think?
[02:27:28.294 --> 02:27:28.954]  Well, it's the same thing.
[02:27:28.975 --> 02:27:30.796]  When you go out to the events, none of them can talk.
[02:27:30.836 --> 02:27:31.736]  They only have chants.
[02:27:32.157 --> 02:27:33.237]  They say, don't talk to them.
[02:27:33.317 --> 02:27:33.878]  It's a cult.
[02:27:34.078 --> 02:27:35.079]  That's the chants thing.
[02:27:35.099 --> 02:27:38.521]  I'm telling you, it's like starting to freak me out, to be honest with you.
[02:27:38.881 --> 02:27:39.622]  But that's why we can't.
[02:27:40.002 --> 02:27:40.402]  I don't care.
[02:27:40.743 --> 02:27:41.883]  As long as they're out in the streets.
[02:27:41.903 --> 02:27:42.844]  It's like pod people.
[02:27:42.924 --> 02:27:47.307]  As long as they're out in the streets doing that, you know what, as long as they're not burning anything.
[02:27:47.327 --> 02:27:50.369]  But as individuals, we're frightened by mindless chanting and no info.
[02:27:50.729 --> 02:27:52.410]  For followers, that's kind of fun.
[02:27:52.511 --> 02:27:54.792]  Because they'll vote for Hillary Clinton.
[02:27:55.473 --> 02:27:56.994]  That's how stupid they are.
[02:27:58.001 --> 02:28:03.745]  They won't even, even, look, look, Bernie Sanders, who I think is a total fraud, his wife is being investigated for bank fraud.
[02:28:03.785 --> 02:28:05.987]  White people don't know what it's like to be poor!
[02:28:06.187 --> 02:28:08.609]  The guy openly had the election stolen!
[02:28:09.230 --> 02:28:10.871]  Just ripped right out in front of him!
[02:28:10.911 --> 02:28:14.393]  Oh, and by the way, Alex, I'm actually, I don't know if you've covered this, um...
[02:28:15.154 --> 02:28:19.078]  But I'm actually working on finding the source of this and seeing if it's legit.
[02:28:19.498 --> 02:28:22.201]  Obviously, Seth Rich was the head of the IT at the DNC.
[02:28:22.721 --> 02:28:29.467]  There are rumors going that Seth Rich actually had intel on how exactly Hillary Clinton actually rigged these elections.
[02:28:30.248 --> 02:28:39.213]  He actually had these voter rolls that they doubled, and then they basically stole votes from Bernie Sanders and broke the law by hiding the paperwork.
[02:28:39.253 --> 02:28:41.374]  Like I said, there's a letter going around right now.
[02:28:41.514 --> 02:28:44.835]  It's rumored that it was Seth Rich's girlfriend who put this letter out.
[02:28:44.895 --> 02:28:47.197]  Some people say it's his friend, others say girlfriend.
[02:28:47.217 --> 02:28:50.138]  Well, obviously, Hillary was like 40 points behind him everywhere.
[02:28:50.438 --> 02:28:51.079]  They just stole it.
[02:28:51.479 --> 02:28:52.019]  Just stole it!
[02:28:52.479 --> 02:28:53.040]  Just stole it!
[02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:56.681]  And here's a Democrat who actually loves the country, so you know what they had to do?
[02:28:56.942 --> 02:28:57.422]  They had to kill him.
[02:28:58.919 --> 02:28:59.959]  I mean, how dare you?
[02:29:00.019 --> 02:29:00.480]  Don't you know?
[02:29:00.580 --> 02:29:04.021]  I came, I saw, he died, but she took over Libby and killed hundreds of thousands?
[02:29:04.381 --> 02:29:11.104]  So I'm just curious, and here, and look, there are, you know, Democrats or Liberals who actually see what happened with Seth Rich.
[02:29:11.144 --> 02:29:14.485]  Can we play place boing when we come back in where she's like, er, er, er, er?
[02:29:14.865 --> 02:29:17.286]  And like... They voted for that!
[02:29:18.366 --> 02:29:19.487]  They'd vote for it today!
[02:29:19.927 --> 02:29:20.607]  Well, they like it.
[02:29:20.627 --> 02:29:23.308]  I mean, they see a big, evil murderer and they feel powerful.
[02:29:24.249 --> 02:29:25.469]  I mean, what the hell is that?
[02:29:25.769 --> 02:29:27.450]  How the hell do you get that brainwash?
[02:29:28.513 --> 02:29:30.114]  How the hell do you get that stupid?
[02:29:30.354 --> 02:29:31.535]  You're in a herd think.
[02:29:31.955 --> 02:29:33.256]  You don't think for yourself.
[02:29:33.336 --> 02:29:34.676]  You don't, you're, you're dead.
[02:29:34.776 --> 02:29:35.617]  You're already dead.
[02:29:35.957 --> 02:29:37.978]  Like, when they come up to me and go, you're a Russian agent.
[02:29:38.498 --> 02:29:41.680]  And like, they're all powerful and I'm like, what's your proof?
[02:29:41.740 --> 02:29:42.461]  Russian agent!
[02:29:42.861 --> 02:29:45.562]  Do you realize how pathetic that is when they're globalist agents?
[02:29:45.622 --> 02:29:46.303]  Ridiculous!
[02:29:46.723 --> 02:29:48.804]  We'll be back with huge breaking news straight ahead.
[02:29:48.824 --> 02:29:50.065]  I'll get to the inside White House in a moment.
[02:29:50.085 --> 02:29:50.365]  March.
[02:29:50.865 --> 02:29:52.486]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.406 --> 02:29:56.088]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.567 --> 02:30:03.833]  Imagine the world without InfoWars.
[02:30:05.076 --> 02:30:07.884]  The globalists have already consolidated their power.
[02:30:09.696 --> 02:30:13.398]  They don't want people to have their own economies, their own choices.
[02:30:14.099 --> 02:30:27.406]  When you spread the links to Infowars.com news stories and our videos, when you tell friends, family, and neighbors about our free iPhone and Droid apps, or send them a link to our daily podcast, you are involved in a revolutionary act against tyranny.
[02:30:27.826 --> 02:30:33.049]  It was George Orwell that said, in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[02:30:33.770 --> 02:30:37.592]  That's why I spend a lot of time trying to not just innovate,
[02:30:38.893 --> 02:30:44.978]  News and analysis and our fight against the globalists, but also thinking about how we're able to fund our operation.
[02:30:45.258 --> 02:30:48.080]  That's so critical to prosecute an information war.
[02:30:49.001 --> 02:31:03.953]  And I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic and high quality.
[02:31:04.374 --> 02:31:06.476]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we have private labeled it.
[02:31:07.828 --> 02:31:20.191]  And it is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emrix Essentials, and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from Infolworkstore.com.
[02:31:20.991 --> 02:31:29.633]  On top of that, if you sign up for AutoShip, you get an additional, out of the gates, 25% off on this product.
[02:31:30.213 --> 02:31:35.314]  Emrix Essentials is all about personal care, hygiene, not getting skin cancer.
[02:31:35.874 --> 02:31:39.536]  Not getting bit by a bunch of bugs and gnats and mosquitoes.
[02:31:40.036 --> 02:31:40.997]  It's all there.
[02:31:41.177 --> 02:31:45.219]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash.
[02:31:45.679 --> 02:31:47.780]  All of it is truly game-changing.
[02:31:48.280 --> 02:31:49.081]  Be-A-Way spray.
[02:31:49.381 --> 02:31:51.382]  Totally organic, essential oils.
[02:31:52.122 --> 02:31:55.684]  Works a lot better than the toxic chemical systems that are out there.
[02:31:56.045 --> 02:31:58.326]  And it is comparable in price.
[02:31:58.626 --> 02:32:00.047]  And again, it's concentrated.
[02:32:00.388 --> 02:32:01.809]  The deodorant is amazing.
[02:32:02.289 --> 02:32:02.969]  High quality.
[02:32:03.630 --> 02:32:05.191]  Doesn't have the aluminum garbage in it.
[02:32:05.471 --> 02:32:06.211]  Totally natural.
[02:32:06.492 --> 02:32:06.992]  Works great.
[02:32:07.913 --> 02:32:10.754]  SPF 30 face and body lotion sunscreen.
[02:32:11.155 --> 02:32:11.675]  Unscented.
[02:32:12.235 --> 02:32:13.176]  This is exciting.
[02:32:13.276 --> 02:32:16.959]  Because so many of the so-called sunscreens that are out there are toxic.
[02:32:17.459 --> 02:32:19.420]  As everyone knows, I'm obsessed with Win-Wins.
[02:32:19.440 --> 02:32:20.081]  20% off what it is retail.
[02:32:22.342 --> 02:32:27.224]  Because we cut out the middleman, and then additionally, you sign up for auto-ship out of the gates.
[02:32:27.244 --> 02:32:28.985]  25% off that.
[02:32:29.465 --> 02:32:31.486]  Because I want you to try these products.
[02:32:31.626 --> 02:32:32.866]  I want you to love these products.
[02:32:33.206 --> 02:32:43.831]  I want to have a deeper relationship with you in a 360 win, a non-zero-sum game, where you get high quality, you get value, and you repeat order something you need every month.
[02:32:44.711 --> 02:32:52.335]  And then we're able to secure our funding into the future to not just stay at the level we're at, but to grow in the face of enemy attacks.
[02:32:52.615 --> 02:32:57.237]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, and you'll find Emmerich's Essentials.
[02:33:11.704 --> 02:33:14.465]  That's pretty good, Alex.
[02:33:14.485 --> 02:33:17.725]  That might be too good.
[02:33:42.062 --> 02:33:44.743]  You might want to be careful with that.
[02:33:46.824 --> 02:33:51.786]  I totally took my fate in the media.
[02:33:52.026 --> 02:33:53.087]  She's back, by the way.
[02:33:53.187 --> 02:33:53.867]  You know she's back.
[02:33:53.887 --> 02:33:54.568]  She's got a new pack.
[02:33:56.388 --> 02:33:56.909]  Resist.
[02:33:57.949 --> 02:33:58.509]  Persist.
[02:33:59.610 --> 02:34:00.050]  Enlist.
[02:34:01.070 --> 02:34:01.711]  That's her new pack.
[02:34:01.731 --> 02:34:02.071]  Bring her back.
[02:34:10.330 --> 02:34:10.890]  Runner again.
[02:34:11.131 --> 02:34:13.312]  Vote for me because I have a brain tumor.
[02:34:13.392 --> 02:34:14.333]  It's unbelievable.
[02:34:14.373 --> 02:34:16.454]  I can't even imagine where we'd be right now.
[02:34:16.474 --> 02:34:18.976]  She would have already blown up a federal building.
[02:34:19.036 --> 02:34:19.276]  At least.
[02:34:19.517 --> 02:34:20.257]  Blame it on us.
[02:34:20.337 --> 02:34:21.258]  Well, you know what they said.
[02:34:40.959 --> 02:34:44.821]  You know, James Comey didn't want to indict her because he found his own suicide note in her e-mail.
[02:34:45.541 --> 02:34:45.941]  Exactly.
[02:34:45.961 --> 02:34:47.542]  So, you know, he had to step down.
[02:34:48.162 --> 02:34:48.423]  Yeah.
[02:34:49.003 --> 02:34:51.064]  Seth Rich, on the other hand, was a brave man.
[02:34:53.965 --> 02:34:56.066]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:34:56.126 --> 02:35:01.829]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:35:02.810 --> 02:35:03.450]  Hey, let's get serious.
[02:35:03.470 --> 02:35:04.830]  We got Mike Cernovich coming on.
[02:35:05.511 --> 02:35:07.052]  We got Dr. Corsi with big breaking news.
[02:35:07.092 --> 02:35:07.672]  Just briefly,
[02:35:09.244 --> 02:35:10.544]  We've launched Emerix Essentials.
[02:35:10.644 --> 02:35:14.746]  It's six different personal care products at prices way lower you'll find anywhere else.
[02:35:14.806 --> 02:35:19.307]  It's a top three big national organic brand that has allowed us to private label it.
[02:35:19.327 --> 02:35:21.248]  That's why they recognize the bottles when you see it.
[02:35:21.568 --> 02:35:22.488]  We've just changed the names.
[02:35:22.668 --> 02:35:24.368]  20% off retail and storage.
[02:35:24.548 --> 02:35:26.309]  25% off additionally when you sign up for auto ship.
[02:35:26.729 --> 02:35:29.030]  That's 45% off out of the gates.
[02:35:30.050 --> 02:35:36.057]  Just the mouthwash is ounce for ounce the same price as regular mouthwash, but it's 10 to 1 concentrate.
[02:35:36.718 --> 02:35:38.019]  So that'll give you an example.
[02:35:38.079 --> 02:35:41.303]  It's the natural zinc oxide, not the nano that goes through your skin.
[02:35:41.663 --> 02:35:45.047]  So it's the healthy type, the very best out there at half the cost of leading competitors.
[02:35:45.467 --> 02:35:46.649]  The natural body wash, you name it.
[02:35:46.769 --> 02:35:47.470]  Emrix Essentials!
[02:35:47.870 --> 02:35:48.830]  And the name's spelled right.
[02:35:48.850 --> 02:35:50.231]  Wikipedia and all of them have it wrong.
[02:35:50.671 --> 02:35:52.852]  It's E-M-R-I-C-S.
[02:35:53.192 --> 02:35:55.653]  So it's Emmerich Essentials, Emmerich's Essentials.
[02:35:56.033 --> 02:35:59.594]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslive.com, or AAA2533139.
[02:35:59.774 --> 02:36:05.816]  I want to thank you all for your support, because we couldn't do it without you, but we're launching this whole new line.
[02:36:06.997 --> 02:36:09.137]  Sign up for AutoShip, get 25% off.
[02:36:09.157 --> 02:36:10.158]  The other products, it's 10%.
[02:36:10.258 --> 02:36:13.439]  And we have shirts at cost.
[02:36:14.349 --> 02:36:21.192]  The entire Trump Prince, Trump is my president, you name it shirts, info or store.com or triple A 2533139.
[02:36:21.433 --> 02:36:23.674]  Now Mike Cernovich has big breaking news.
[02:36:23.734 --> 02:36:33.579]  I've sat on this for an hour and a half, not on purpose, but because I don't want to say all this wrong and I don't want to get it improper.
[02:36:34.519 --> 02:36:38.981]  When you get big breaking news, then the media tries to take any angle you get not exactly right and spin it.
[02:36:39.401 --> 02:36:41.002]  So I've been trying to confer during breaks.
[02:36:41.703 --> 02:36:42.223]  Where'd my phone go?
[02:36:44.833 --> 02:36:45.893]  Anyways.
[02:36:46.434 --> 02:36:47.374]  Oh, that's right, it's over there.
[02:36:47.414 --> 02:36:48.694]  Sorry, I left it in my office.
[02:36:49.115 --> 02:36:51.835]  The point is, this is a newsroom while you're on air.
[02:36:52.656 --> 02:37:06.761]  So I'm not complaining, but whenever there's a technical difficulty or Joel Skousen has something playing over his feed, I don't care, because we're not like some so-called live Fox or CNN show where they get ready for five, six hours before, they call it live, half of it's tape pieces, and then it's all scripted.
[02:37:06.801 --> 02:37:07.801]  No, this is really live.
[02:37:08.401 --> 02:37:09.702]  And this is really teleprompter-free.
[02:37:10.182 --> 02:37:13.103]  So the train wreck is part of the good aspect of it to show you how real it is, but
[02:37:15.120 --> 02:37:19.945]  Let me just... I'm not holding this to keep you listening.
[02:37:19.965 --> 02:37:21.406]  I just don't want to get this wrong.
[02:37:22.387 --> 02:37:27.031]  And I don't want to... Some things are so big, I don't want to do them live.
[02:37:27.051 --> 02:37:27.632]  That's what I'm saying?
[02:37:29.289 --> 02:37:38.358]  So maybe I should have you take over and I should go focus for about 10 minutes and try to calm down and then write some notes myself off the notes I've got and then kind of give this to you.
[02:37:38.378 --> 02:37:41.161]  But the country's in total civil war right now.
[02:37:41.201 --> 02:37:45.265]  The White House knows that there are foreign powers involved with the Democrats in the espionage.
[02:37:45.425 --> 02:37:46.185]  It's not the Russians.
[02:37:47.146 --> 02:37:51.751]  Let's just say that it's south of North Korea.
[02:37:55.333 --> 02:37:57.595]  I mean, there is a lot of craziness going on.
[02:37:57.615 --> 02:37:59.316]  This is such an epic moment historically.
[02:38:00.096 --> 02:38:01.777]  Let me just go to Cernovich with his breaking news.
[02:38:01.898 --> 02:38:04.559]  My God, everything we've talked about has been breaking a month later, a week later.
[02:38:05.300 --> 02:38:06.361]  And that's why we're so under attack.
[02:38:06.381 --> 02:38:07.321]  We have these sources.
[02:38:08.182 --> 02:38:11.124]  And now I've got this other bombshell news about the Civil War taking place.
[02:38:11.824 --> 02:38:14.165]  It has to do with Fox News and so much more.
[02:38:14.445 --> 02:38:18.487]  Let's go to Mike Cernovich, one of the greatest investigative living journalists today.
[02:38:18.507 --> 02:38:20.729]  That's what they call him, and myself, the King of Fake News.
[02:38:21.109 --> 02:38:24.610]  Mike, you're hosting the fourth hour already today, coming up in 22 minutes.
[02:38:24.650 --> 02:38:28.312]  Give us a little forte, a little hors d'oeuvre on what's coming up.
[02:38:29.453 --> 02:38:33.975]  Yeah, so, you know, literally I'm 10 minutes late because I was breaking a story.
[02:38:34.055 --> 02:38:35.156]  I got official word
[02:38:36.055 --> 02:38:40.518]  The Trump movement is over in 120 days from when he was elected.
[02:38:40.598 --> 02:38:42.059]  It's almost over, and I'll tell you why.
[02:38:42.699 --> 02:38:45.061]  Johnny DeStefano is the guy's name.
[02:38:45.081 --> 02:38:48.623]  He's head of personnel for Trump, and he's a never-Trumper.
[02:38:49.204 --> 02:38:55.548]  The current people who are actually pro-Trump people, they're Schedule C presidential employees.
[02:38:56.048 --> 02:38:57.409]  That only lasts for 120 days.
[02:38:59.230 --> 02:39:00.631]  That is being expired.
[02:39:00.711 --> 02:39:08.117]  And what I'm hearing is that in the personnel office and Johnny DeStefano in particular, they're not going to give them permanent positions.
[02:39:08.498 --> 02:39:09.999]  Fewer than 15 percent.
[02:39:10.639 --> 02:39:11.220]  One five.
[02:39:11.600 --> 02:39:18.666]  Fewer than 15 percent of people who came in as temporary presidential schedule C employees are being made permanent.
[02:39:18.946 --> 02:39:21.627]  So it's pretty much over in a few days, Alex.
[02:39:21.667 --> 02:39:23.227]  That's how dire things are right now.
[02:39:23.648 --> 02:39:27.429]  I was told all the pro-Trump people are going to be shoved out.
[02:39:27.909 --> 02:39:30.150]  Only 15% of them are going to be made permanent.
[02:39:30.190 --> 02:39:34.091]  People have moved across the country, people who supported Trump, people who are on the base.
[02:39:34.491 --> 02:39:44.254]  So they said day 120, it's over for Trump and that's when the GOP and Congress are going to move in and start with the impeachment stuff because the purge is on.
[02:39:45.489 --> 02:39:51.494]  Now we talked a few nights ago and you talked to some of your high level sources saying that the word was it was going to be over, that Trump's been totally encircled.
[02:39:51.915 --> 02:39:56.159]  You now talk to these folks, I know they've used the national security clearances to block patriots getting in.
[02:39:56.559 --> 02:40:02.965]  Hopefully Trump gets this info and there's a counter firing that Colonel Schaefer and so many others have talked about where he removes these people.
[02:40:03.005 --> 02:40:04.987]  I mean, isn't this now do or die for Trump?
[02:40:06.007 --> 02:40:13.916]  No, I mean, it's do or die for the whole movement because as you know, personnel is policy and what I've heard from multiple sources, they're now joking.
[02:40:14.216 --> 02:40:14.997]  It's not a joke.
[02:40:15.037 --> 02:40:17.901]  I mean, they're now kind of quibbling, quibbling at the White House.
[02:40:18.321 --> 02:40:24.108]  The only way to get a hundred, to get within a hundred feet of Trump in the White House is to have tweeted out that you were never Trump.
[02:40:24.648 --> 02:40:25.969]  That's how dire it's gotten.
[02:40:26.529 --> 02:40:30.831]  And now that these temporary people aren't going to be made permanent, they're just going to be gone.
[02:40:31.171 --> 02:40:39.154]  Johnny DeStefano, who was a Never Trumper, he was... Brian Hook, another Never Trumper, they laundered all their Never Trump messages through their wives and other people.
[02:40:39.907 --> 02:40:41.908]  Those are the people who are running personnel out.
[02:40:42.028 --> 02:40:55.593]  So, once these temporary appointees are out of there, Trump is going to have zero support, no loyalists, and then that's when the House GOP, the Congressional GOP, is going to move in and take him out.
[02:40:55.633 --> 02:40:57.073]  So, I don't know what to say.
[02:40:57.153 --> 02:40:58.654]  It really is do or die right now.
[02:40:58.714 --> 02:41:00.414]  This couldn't be any more dire.
[02:41:00.855 --> 02:41:03.556]  Well, the word is Trump's getting ready to axe the upper-level leadership.
[02:41:03.596 --> 02:41:06.877]  What does he need to do specifically, Mike Cernovich, to kill this?
[02:41:07.817 --> 02:41:09.341]  Get ready, Johnny DeStefano.
[02:41:09.862 --> 02:41:12.669]  His head of personnel, Google Johnny DeStefano.
[02:41:13.467 --> 02:41:15.189]  He's the head of personnel.
[02:41:15.229 --> 02:41:17.231]  He makes all of the personnel decisions.
[02:41:17.651 --> 02:41:23.257]  I realize, you know, a lot of us, we talk about Renz Priebus and Spicer because they're the big celebrities.
[02:41:23.617 --> 02:41:26.620]  But the real power, I'm told now, it isn't Renz Priebus anymore.
[02:41:27.240 --> 02:41:36.249]  Johnny DeStefano has more power than anyone else in the White House, probably than Trump himself, because this guy is bringing in like a Trojan horse.
[02:41:36.289 --> 02:41:37.631]  He is bringing in Never Trumpers.
[02:41:38.291 --> 02:41:38.551]  I think so.
[02:42:00.020 --> 02:42:07.427]  That a lot of the information we're getting about Priebus is a distraction from what's going on with Johnny DeStefano.
[02:42:07.528 --> 02:42:11.892]  He is actually the person with the most power, more power now than Rens Priebus himself.
[02:42:13.854 --> 02:42:15.876]  And they're certainly moving on Trump right now.
[02:42:15.896 --> 02:42:17.598]  I'll go ahead and break down the information I got.
[02:42:18.338 --> 02:42:20.481]  Rupert Murdoch has been on the fence about Trump.
[02:42:21.354 --> 02:42:30.778]  And over the weekend, talked to Trump on Sunday and decided to go ahead and warn Trump about the plans with the Democrats to turn over Fox News, to get rid of it, to go ahead and call it out.
[02:42:30.858 --> 02:42:32.559]  But they see their ratings down by a third.
[02:42:33.100 --> 02:42:34.700]  They see that billion dollars being lost.
[02:42:34.760 --> 02:42:37.021]  And they know the Democrats have always been their enemies as well.
[02:42:37.382 --> 02:42:48.707]  So Murdoch's having second thoughts about turning the empire over to his sons and family and warn Trump, fire everyone you've got in there and bring in people and follow Reagan's example.
[02:42:49.667 --> 02:42:53.890]  Uh, and put in a bunch of patriots right now, or you're done.
[02:42:53.971 --> 02:42:55.151]  They are going to impeach you.
[02:42:55.472 --> 02:42:58.474]  So I've had this info for an hour and a half.
[02:42:59.014 --> 02:43:02.357]  Cernovich, I wanted him on separately today just to pop in because he's hosting the fourth hour.
[02:43:02.737 --> 02:43:04.438]  He's basically mirrored some of the info.
[02:43:04.678 --> 02:43:08.921]  But what I'm giving people is directly, uh, from the highest levels.
[02:43:09.141 --> 02:43:13.585]  One of the other things that Trump doesn't even know about, but has been confirmed by intel agencies
[02:43:15.154 --> 02:43:27.303]  Jared Kushner met with the Russian ambassador in the middle of the campaign, long before Trump was even the presumptive nominee, in early 2016, even before Cleveland.
[02:43:27.903 --> 02:43:31.125]  And Trump never knew about this, that Kushner met with the Russian ambassador
[02:43:32.026 --> 02:43:45.341]  And then when Trump comes out and says none of my campaign ever met with him, well the whole time it's Kushner feeding that as a way to parlay things to the Morning Show and others that he indeed is the ace card of the Russians.
[02:43:45.441 --> 02:43:50.968]  Jared Kushner is the double agent operative who is the only one that actually did meet
[02:43:51.608 --> 02:44:01.314]  None of the Trump people did, and he's been the one feeding the intel the entire time, I guess wanting to get funding for his failed 666 in a Fifth Avenue building or whatever the rest of it is.
[02:44:01.354 --> 02:44:18.965]  But Jared Kushner is the person that did meet with the Russians and did discuss things and has been the point of contact, and Trump never even knew about that until about a month ago when Kushner said, I'm ready to testify to Congress about my Russian meetings.
[02:44:19.795 --> 02:44:28.999]  That was just to make him look clear and open later when Jerry Kutcher, through weakness or whatever, is one of the main moles that met with the Russian ambassador.
[02:44:29.359 --> 02:44:41.604]  And then again, Rupert Murdoch has decided to join with Trump because he believes it's a double-cross to take down all conservatives, including Fox News entirely, and has told Trump he needs to have a sweeping purge right now or he will be destroyed when the personnel change comes over.
[02:44:41.884 --> 02:44:44.485]  I didn't exactly know what they meant by the big personnel change.
[02:44:44.785 --> 02:44:45.886]  I thought Trump was doing the sweep.
[02:44:45.906 --> 02:44:47.927]  They said, no, he's got to do a total sweep.
[02:44:48.487 --> 02:44:57.472]  To stop their complete takeover, and I didn't quite understand it, and then Cernovich, like, you know, a key and a lock, or a horse and a carriage, perfect storm, this all just came together.
[02:44:58.553 --> 02:45:16.523]  Yeah, no, you're exactly right, and it isn't as sexy to a lot of people as the Sean Spicer-Renz Priebus thing, but that was, that was the key, is your sources were giving you great information, as always, but the key was that they're all 100, because you and I, you know, we're not bureaucrats, so a lot of the stuff we hear, we're like, well, wait a minute.
[02:45:16.543 --> 02:45:17.584]  A lot of it goes over our head.
[02:45:18.419 --> 02:45:26.131]  Yeah, so the key is that if you look up and, you know, your production team can find it, it's called a Schedule C Presidential Employee.
[02:45:26.572 --> 02:45:28.115]  They're in there on 120-day terms.
[02:45:28.135 --> 02:45:32.321]  And they're transitional, and then if they don't all get authorized and approved, they're gone.
[02:45:33.064 --> 02:45:33.564]  Exactly.
[02:45:33.865 --> 02:45:36.647]  And there are somewhere between 800 and 1,200 of them.
[02:45:37.247 --> 02:45:40.450]  Fewer than 15% have been made permanent.
[02:45:40.790 --> 02:45:43.452]  So that is Johnny DeStefano's silent coup.
[02:45:43.772 --> 02:45:47.135]  That's why the fake news media won't cover it because they're controlled by Deep State.
[02:45:47.475 --> 02:45:52.899]  So I want people, I don't know if, we need to call the Office of Personnel Policy, Alex.
[02:45:52.939 --> 02:45:54.260]  We need to jam their phone lines.
[02:45:54.660 --> 02:45:57.462]  I don't know if there's a line, a phone number or something.
[02:45:57.883 --> 02:45:59.024]  We need to jam their phone lines.
[02:45:59.044 --> 02:46:02.126]  You call the White House and ask to be routed to the Office of Personnel Management.
[02:46:02.657 --> 02:46:05.259]  Yeah, we need to get on the phones because if...
[02:46:33.657 --> 02:46:35.618]  This is hardcore, the level we've gotten to.
[02:46:36.999 --> 02:46:40.281]  And it's just getting crazier and crazier and crazier.
[02:46:40.661 --> 02:46:42.302]  And there's very few patriots in.
[02:46:42.322 --> 02:46:43.322]  They're very high level.
[02:46:44.083 --> 02:46:46.024]  And Trump is just completely surrounded.
[02:46:46.064 --> 02:46:50.546]  He's got to know they are going to get these people in where he has no protection.
[02:46:50.926 --> 02:46:53.307]  They're going to leak a bunch of lies and they're going to destroy him.
[02:46:53.367 --> 02:46:54.288]  He is hopping mad.
[02:46:54.708 --> 02:46:55.368]  He wants him out.
[02:46:55.408 --> 02:46:56.209]  He wants a purge.
[02:46:56.629 --> 02:46:59.830]  The problem is none of them will follow his orders to even do it.
[02:46:59.870 --> 02:47:00.971]  So, Mike Cernovich,
[02:47:01.351 --> 02:47:03.692]  We'll be following you coming up in the fourth hour today.
[02:47:03.712 --> 02:47:06.294]  If stations out there aren't carrying the fourth hour, a lot of them do.
[02:47:06.614 --> 02:47:08.055]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:47:08.075 --> 02:47:08.475]  Thank you, Mike.
[02:47:09.155 --> 02:47:09.476]  Thank you.
[02:47:10.521 --> 02:47:20.407]  Yeah, I mean, at this point, this is so real and so sickening and so painful that I don't have any personal ties to Trump, other than I've talked to him, you know, 10 times or whatever.
[02:47:20.427 --> 02:47:22.389]  It's just, I know he's real.
[02:47:22.429 --> 02:47:23.469]  He cares about the country.
[02:47:23.830 --> 02:47:25.130]  He's surrounded by scum.
[02:47:25.691 --> 02:47:28.553]  It's like watching a baby getting eaten by a hundred rats or something.
[02:47:28.593 --> 02:47:30.894]  And because we won't empower the president, he's like a baby.
[02:47:30.934 --> 02:47:32.715]  He can't move because he can't do it all himself.
[02:47:32.995 --> 02:47:33.536]  And the rats,
[02:47:33.976 --> 02:47:34.818]  They're like eating him.
[02:47:34.838 --> 02:47:36.702]  It's not like a lion being eaten by hyenas.
[02:47:37.003 --> 02:47:37.344]  It's worse.
[02:47:37.404 --> 02:47:38.065]  It's a baby.
[02:47:38.125 --> 02:47:41.192]  The rebirth of America being eaten by these little red-eyed rats.
[02:47:42.429 --> 02:47:44.230]  And he's just surrounded.
[02:47:44.270 --> 02:47:45.290]  We need a battle plan.
[02:47:45.310 --> 02:47:48.412]  So Dr. Corsi was texting me this morning saying, we got to get a battle plan.
[02:47:48.752 --> 02:47:49.832]  We got to get on the offensive.
[02:47:49.912 --> 02:47:51.473]  And I was saying, yeah, battle plan, battle plan.
[02:47:51.753 --> 02:47:53.134]  So he's writing articles about this.
[02:47:53.834 --> 02:47:55.034]  This is just so crazy.
[02:47:55.595 --> 02:47:56.775]  But they're all in.
[02:47:56.815 --> 02:47:58.636]  The globalist leftists are all in.
[02:47:59.556 --> 02:48:00.797]  What is your intel there?
[02:48:01.217 --> 02:48:04.839]  As our DC head and Dr. Corsi, what do we do to turn this tide?
[02:48:04.859 --> 02:48:07.900]  Because it's clear more than ever, they are making their run at the president right now.
[02:48:08.956 --> 02:48:11.918]  Well, Alex, what I'm doing is that the first article is today.
[02:48:11.938 --> 02:48:18.224]  I mean, this is something I've been specially trained in, this whole issue of disinformation and propaganda.
[02:48:19.044 --> 02:48:33.516]  I actually was trained by Edward Bernays, who is the father of public relations, and he wrote the book called Propaganda in the 1930s that was responsible for the Garibald's propaganda and the rise of Nazi Hitler.
[02:48:34.137 --> 02:48:35.698]  And so, you know, Nazi Germany.
[02:48:36.298 --> 02:48:38.060]  And what I'm saying is I'm laying out
[02:48:38.993 --> 02:48:45.158]  The techniques that work and don't work when you're under a disinformation propaganda technique.
[02:48:45.939 --> 02:48:50.203]  There's been study, there's rules, and if Trump follows these rules, he's gonna win.
[02:48:50.883 --> 02:49:02.093]  Now, the first rule, and what I wrote up today, is that the idea is you create a false narrative, a meme, and this meme is Russian collusion.
[02:49:02.113 --> 02:49:04.816]  You just keep propping that lie up.
[02:49:05.963 --> 02:49:09.224]  And yes, and there's no evidence for it, okay?
[02:49:09.244 --> 02:49:17.327]  We've had repeated statements from Senator Feinstein, who May 4th... Sure, there's no evidence.
[02:49:17.407 --> 02:49:18.847]  I mean, we've got that from... There's no evidence.
[02:49:19.067 --> 02:49:20.748]  We've got that from Schiff, all of them.
[02:49:21.505 --> 02:49:35.230]  Yeah, but that doesn't defeat the mem, because you see, Schiff then says, well, there's circumstantial evidence, and we may have not discovered it yet, but we're going to find it.
[02:49:35.851 --> 02:49:43.914]  So a mem, a lie, a propaganda disinformation campaign, is not defeated by information or the truth.
[02:49:44.774 --> 02:49:46.515]  It's a hard point to get across.
[02:49:47.148 --> 02:49:52.613]  But I mean, if you take a look and you say that Hitler's attacking the Jews under these... Sure, it's like Saul Alinsky.
[02:49:52.973 --> 02:49:54.875]  It's hard to defeat him just debating him with the facts.
[02:49:55.455 --> 02:50:01.360]  Yeah, and the more facts you adduce, even if you're right, it just extends the argument.
[02:50:01.861 --> 02:50:02.882]  It adds the snowball.
[02:50:02.942 --> 02:50:05.724]  Instead, you circumvent and attack the fact that Alinsky's a piece of crap.
[02:50:06.405 --> 02:50:12.070]  Right, and so, you know, the basic corollaries are that, you know, if you take a look at dealing with it, the first is,
[02:50:13.192 --> 02:50:23.735]  The facts are not going to work because they just say you're part of a conspiracy theory that you don't believe the truth of the Russian collusion story.
[02:50:24.295 --> 02:50:28.037]  So they demonize you and you become part of a conspiracy theory.
[02:50:28.097 --> 02:50:35.619]  And second, the second corollary is basically that, you know, no matter how you, anyone who attempts to prove this,
[02:50:36.368 --> 02:50:47.318]  Who tries to stand up and say, wait a minute, you know, it was Hillary that was part of the being paid over the uranium or was Podesta being paid in stock over this company, Jolie.
[02:50:47.658 --> 02:50:52.843]  Well, now you're just part of the conspiracy theory and the mainstream media is never going to report.
[02:50:53.536 --> 02:51:03.099]  Anything that's contrary to the meme that is being put out, the narrative by the deep state and the mainstream media who are determined to set this lie.
[02:51:03.199 --> 02:51:06.740]  Exactly, so you were trained to be able to counter these type of foreign government operations.
[02:51:07.100 --> 02:51:08.161]  We didn't work for the State Department.
[02:51:08.181 --> 02:51:09.141]  First time we ever talked about this.
[02:51:09.181 --> 02:51:10.001]  I know you were involved in it.
[02:51:10.321 --> 02:51:12.562]  You've also written best-selling books that have affected elections.
[02:51:12.582 --> 02:51:15.903]  So you're an expert on using what was the ultimate propaganda weapon, truth.
[02:51:16.703 --> 02:51:20.526]  How do we deal with MEMS, Total Manufactured False Reality Paradigms?
[02:51:20.546 --> 02:51:23.649]  Because if you debate the false paradigm, you add energy and power to it.
[02:51:23.689 --> 02:51:24.609]  How do you circumvent it?
[02:51:25.530 --> 02:51:34.397]  Well, first of all, the first point I'm writing in this article is that you've got to understand that you're not going to beat this by facts.
[02:51:35.218 --> 02:51:37.540]  You're not going to beat it by proving that it was wrong.
[02:51:37.940 --> 02:51:41.443]  That never makes it go away to the true believers of the MEMS, to the law.
[02:51:41.563 --> 02:51:44.225]  I say we get on the offense with all the crimes they've committed and go after them.
[02:51:45.518 --> 02:51:49.866]  Yeah, in no amount of, you know, let's go after Hillary, let's go after Podesta.
[02:51:49.906 --> 02:51:50.707]  This is not true.
[02:51:50.747 --> 02:51:51.548]  There's no evidence.
[02:51:52.049 --> 02:51:53.271]  The meme still continues.
[02:51:53.331 --> 02:51:59.382]  Now, the subsequent articles, what I'm going to show is how you gain control of the narrative again.
[02:52:00.006 --> 02:52:08.634]  How you recapture the narrative, take it out of the hands of the deep state, and how you take it over from the mainstream media.
[02:52:09.114 --> 02:52:12.437]  What Trump is not doing very well right now is he's not managing the news.
[02:52:13.158 --> 02:52:14.739]  Trump has lost control of the news.
[02:52:14.780 --> 02:52:16.241]  He used to be on the news constantly.
[02:52:16.281 --> 02:52:20.164]  They told him to be presidential, give up your phone, back off so they can eat him alive.
[02:52:20.445 --> 02:52:21.566]  What is Trump going to do right now?
[02:52:22.438 --> 02:52:38.807]  Well, the first thing in the next article is going to be, I'm just drafting it now, we'll have it up tomorrow, is that Trump has got to basically take over the narrative by impacting, doing something that changes the narrative altogether.
[02:52:38.848 --> 02:52:45.211]  Well, he's trying by saying jobs and stopping terror, but how does he change the narrative on this specifically?
[02:52:45.251 --> 02:52:46.232]  Let me give you an example.
[02:52:46.252 --> 02:52:47.633]  Like indict Hillary Clinton?
[02:52:49.001 --> 02:52:49.941]  I want to give you an example.
[02:52:49.961 --> 02:52:51.942]  I don't want to completely give away the article from tomorrow.
[02:52:51.962 --> 02:52:54.043]  I want to do this step-by-step so it sinks in.
[02:52:54.643 --> 02:53:03.006]  But when Trump, for instance, had the missile attack, the cruise missile attack on Syria, everything about Russia stopped.
[02:53:03.146 --> 02:53:04.826]  That was an example of how he changed the subject.
[02:53:05.447 --> 02:53:06.327]  He changed the subject.
[02:53:06.989 --> 02:53:08.570]  And Trump has got to figure out some ways.
[02:53:08.590 --> 02:53:13.654]  I'm going to give tomorrow, in tomorrow's article, a whole series of effective ways in which Trump can change the subject.
[02:53:14.135 --> 02:53:17.057]  Now, this is really a methodology.
[02:53:17.077 --> 02:53:18.318]  I'm laying out a plan.
[02:53:18.839 --> 02:53:20.120]  This is stuff that's been proven.
[02:53:20.140 --> 02:53:21.180]  The State Department has done it.
[02:53:21.200 --> 02:53:24.043]  It's been proven by the experts in the CIA.
[02:53:24.403 --> 02:53:26.865]  I've studied it for, you know, 30, 40 years.
[02:53:27.586 --> 02:53:31.349]  How you basically change the subject, silence the press,
[02:53:32.580 --> 02:53:35.883]  It's time to reorganize the government and take control.
[02:53:35.903 --> 02:53:36.403]  I agree.
[02:53:36.423 --> 02:53:38.645]  Well, I'll be tuning in tomorrow when you're here and read the next article.
[02:53:38.705 --> 02:53:41.167]  Give us the name of the current article you wrote too today.
[02:53:41.507 --> 02:53:42.748]  Which one should we point out to folks?
[02:53:43.309 --> 02:53:50.955]  Well, the point one, the one that's up there right now, the deep state mainstream media pushes a coup d'etat against Trump that the elites want him impeached.
[02:53:50.975 --> 02:53:52.016]  That needs to go totally viral.
[02:53:52.859 --> 02:54:18.909]  It's important to understand that the purpose of this meme, the reason this whole Russian collusion argument is being advanced, is that Deep State and the mainstream media think it's the kind of a big lie, a Hitler big lie, you know, the Jews are behind the conspiracy destroying Germany, the Jews are a deficient race, eugenics, all a lie, but that lie can be made into a
[02:54:20.197 --> 02:54:21.579]  Big enough false truth.
[02:54:21.699 --> 02:54:23.020]  A whole new cosmology.
[02:54:23.781 --> 02:54:24.001]  Yes.
[02:54:24.542 --> 02:54:26.064]  And that that's what will take down Trump.
[02:54:26.124 --> 02:54:26.845]  That's the bet.
[02:54:27.345 --> 02:54:28.146]  That's the gambit.
[02:54:28.206 --> 02:54:29.568]  And they're betting everything they got on it.
[02:54:30.629 --> 02:54:38.077]  And what I'm saying is, first of all, you're not going to defeat this false nem, this lie, by proving it's untrue.
[02:54:38.976 --> 02:54:42.059]  Because that just reinforces... No, I agree, because we argue all day.
[02:54:42.139 --> 02:54:43.119]  It's like the other big lie.
[02:54:43.220 --> 02:54:44.380]  Oh, he gave the Russians secrets.
[02:54:44.421 --> 02:54:46.302]  No, it was all laptop news known two months ago.
[02:54:46.642 --> 02:54:47.563]  But then we just debate it.
[02:54:47.603 --> 02:54:48.184]  They don't care.
[02:54:48.204 --> 02:54:50.465]  They want to engage us in their false paradigm.
[02:54:52.247 --> 02:54:52.687]  And that's right.
[02:54:53.428 --> 02:54:55.269]  As soon as we're debating it, we lose.
[02:54:55.890 --> 02:55:06.819]  As soon as we debate it, we're creating... So we just say you're a bunch of traitorous liars, and we move on to the fact that he's trying to turn the economy back on, and you just... I mean, I know you want to get to your ideas tomorrow, but give us a little prelude.
[02:55:07.591 --> 02:55:14.124]  Well, I mean, tomorrow it's basically I'm going to propose a series of steps that Trump can take which would change the subject.
[02:55:14.770 --> 02:55:15.831]  And you've got one coming up.
[02:55:15.851 --> 02:55:19.272]  He's going to take this foreign trip, which is going to be a major foreign trip.
[02:55:19.352 --> 02:55:21.413]  Hey, why doesn't he just arrest some Russian spies?
[02:55:21.753 --> 02:55:24.414]  Because, I mean, sad for the Russians, but you know they've got spies here.
[02:55:24.715 --> 02:55:26.575]  Why not just, like, arrest some of them or something?
[02:55:26.796 --> 02:55:28.036]  I don't know.
[02:55:28.056 --> 02:55:31.398]  Maybe that feeds into it, though.
[02:55:32.498 --> 02:55:34.139]  You've got to go outside the theme.
[02:55:34.179 --> 02:55:35.940]  No, no, I agree.
[02:55:35.960 --> 02:55:36.860]  That's why I said that.
[02:55:36.920 --> 02:55:37.801]  So what's outside the theme?
[02:55:38.061 --> 02:55:39.621]  You bust Hillary for being a Chinese agent?
[02:55:39.662 --> 02:55:40.042]  We know that.
[02:55:40.082 --> 02:55:40.502]  That's true.
[02:55:41.198 --> 02:55:46.263]  No, but these are all within the same kind of refuting the evidence argument.
[02:55:46.283 --> 02:55:48.385]  You've got to jump leapfrog it.
[02:55:48.405 --> 02:55:49.666]  You've got to forget about the rest.
[02:55:49.686 --> 02:55:50.447]  Total new universe!
[02:55:52.069 --> 02:55:54.271]  Change it by saying, okay, we're going on a foreign trip.
[02:55:54.798 --> 02:55:56.799]  You know, there's a whole series of steps he can take.
[02:55:56.819 --> 02:55:59.801]  I'm going to discuss some foreign policy steps he can take.
[02:55:59.821 --> 02:56:01.682]  I'm going to discuss some executive orders.
[02:56:02.083 --> 02:56:06.686]  There's steps and ways that he can gain control of the narrative, the agenda.
[02:56:06.986 --> 02:56:13.190]  He's got to make the deep state and the mainstream media follow him rather than lead him.
[02:56:13.630 --> 02:56:16.312]  And right now they're leading him with... And he's always been great on that.
[02:56:16.412 --> 02:56:20.535]  Why once he suddenly got in, 50, 60 days, did suddenly he stop leading the narrative?
[02:56:20.555 --> 02:56:20.935]  What happened?
[02:56:21.806 --> 02:56:24.347]  Well, they're very good at this, the mainstream media.
[02:56:24.387 --> 02:56:28.408]  They laid the trap, Hillary laid the trap, saying that it was the Russians who did it.
[02:56:29.208 --> 02:56:38.530]  Even the evidence that Seth Rich had 44,000 emails to WikiLeaks, that doesn't refute the Russian collision, collusion argument.
[02:56:39.250 --> 02:56:42.211]  You can't win that argument with the propagandist.
[02:56:42.771 --> 02:56:43.992]  You're not going to win on that one.
[02:56:44.412 --> 02:56:45.934]  They're going to beat you.
[02:56:45.954 --> 02:56:51.978]  They're going to convince the people who hate you that the Jews are all evil and we need to kill them all.
[02:56:52.179 --> 02:56:53.159]  It's a complete lie.
[02:56:53.600 --> 02:56:54.721]  It's total propaganda.
[02:56:54.801 --> 02:56:55.381]  It's evil.
[02:56:55.921 --> 02:57:03.507]  But that's the same nature of argument that the Russian collusion argument fits into, and you can't beat it logically.
[02:57:03.808 --> 02:57:05.169]  You can't beat it with facts.
[02:57:05.749 --> 02:57:06.009]  I agree.
[02:57:06.069 --> 02:57:11.811]  You only beat it by pointing out what the Globalists are actually doing and making it an issue of what they've done with our own narrative.
[02:57:12.091 --> 02:57:17.052]  So what of all the things they're doing under Harnable, what are the true narratives that we go after them on?
[02:57:17.372 --> 02:57:19.333]  I say this, they're trying to plunge the economy.
[02:57:19.673 --> 02:57:21.434]  I knew last night this was going to plunge the economy.
[02:57:21.774 --> 02:57:22.214]  I said it.
[02:57:23.294 --> 02:57:27.015]  Alex, there's no argument you can use that will win.
[02:57:27.675 --> 02:57:29.356]  You have to transcend argument.
[02:57:29.996 --> 02:57:31.456]  There's no going to be magic formula.
[02:57:31.476 --> 02:57:33.497]  There's not going to be an argument that's a magic bullet.
[02:57:34.358 --> 02:57:38.862]  They're set up to beat every argument you could advance against this NEM.
[02:57:39.503 --> 02:57:49.112]  So when they go down the Goebbels path of proving that the Jews are a deficient race, they've all got to be killed, which was a horrendous, horrible, evil idea.
[02:57:49.893 --> 02:57:51.094]  It couldn't be stopped.
[02:57:51.883 --> 02:57:54.104]  With arguments about the brilliance of Einstein.
[02:57:54.124 --> 02:57:55.464]  It had to be stopped with bombs?
[02:57:56.484 --> 02:57:59.325]  No, it's got to be stopped by techniques.
[02:58:00.065 --> 02:58:00.605]  No, I know.
[02:58:00.705 --> 02:58:02.306]  I'm just saying, we went too far.
[02:58:02.326 --> 02:58:03.086]  It had to be military.
[02:58:03.106 --> 02:58:05.766]  Yeah, so we'll talk about those techniques tomorrow.
[02:58:05.786 --> 02:58:06.567]  When do you want to come on?
[02:58:06.587 --> 02:58:07.567]  We're on 11 to 3 Central?
[02:58:08.167 --> 02:58:09.867]  Yeah, I want to come on early tomorrow.
[02:58:09.887 --> 02:58:11.148]  I want to come on early tomorrow.
[02:58:11.168 --> 02:58:12.588]  Alright, how about 1230 Eastern?
[02:58:13.368 --> 02:58:13.828]  That's good.
[02:58:13.988 --> 02:58:14.508]  We'll do that.
[02:58:15.009 --> 02:58:16.609]  Well, I got to tell you, Trump's a good guy.
[02:58:16.649 --> 02:58:17.389]  He's a smart guy.
[02:58:17.409 --> 02:58:19.270]  But isn't it proof how good he is?
[02:58:19.310 --> 02:58:20.410]  How all the evil people hate him?
[02:58:21.329 --> 02:58:27.971]  And if we follow through this, we're going to lay out a plan that Trump can follow, and I guarantee he's going to listen to it and he's going to hear it.
[02:58:28.211 --> 02:58:30.852]  Hey, let me ask you this when we come back, because I've talked to some sources.
[02:58:31.412 --> 02:58:33.092]  We'll do five more minutes with you, and Cernovich is coming up.
[02:58:33.112 --> 02:58:34.213]  We'll host a little bit with Cernovich, though.
[02:58:34.473 --> 02:58:35.833]  Let me ask you this when we come back.
[02:58:37.434 --> 02:58:40.114]  The word is Rupert Murdoch has now decided to join with Trump.
[02:58:40.674 --> 02:58:41.455]  That's the word.
[02:58:41.495 --> 02:58:43.935]  He's finally, for some reason, is going to flip back.
[02:58:44.556 --> 02:58:45.436]  Something's happened.
[02:58:46.176 --> 02:58:46.936]  Is that disinfo?
[02:58:46.976 --> 02:58:47.736]  It comes from the White House.
[02:58:47.756 --> 02:58:49.117]  FBI investigation was into Fox.
[02:58:49.137 --> 02:58:49.717]  That might have stopped.
[02:58:50.899 --> 02:58:55.040]  This is the Infowars Power Pack, and it can start your car if it has a dead battery.
[02:58:56.861 --> 02:58:59.542]  And now, we're going to use the Power Pack to jumpstart this truck.
[02:58:59.962 --> 02:59:00.942]  And we're going to show you!
[02:59:01.362 --> 02:59:06.184]  Switch on the Power Pack, wait a few minutes, and then you'll be able to start your car.
[02:59:06.844 --> 02:59:12.006]  With just a few minutes on the Infowars Battery Pack, you go from a dead battery to this.
[02:59:18.621 --> 02:59:21.364]  You get all that cranking power in this little brick!
[02:59:21.664 --> 02:59:27.630]  The Infowars Power Pack is a must-have, and it'll give you peace of mind whether you're at home or on the go.
[02:59:28.230 --> 02:59:33.656]  It's so compact, it'll fit in your backpack, your glove box, or even your back pocket.
[02:59:34.056 --> 02:59:38.841]  Get one for your home, boat, car, camping setup, or just for emergencies.
[02:59:39.341 --> 02:59:45.931]  Secure your peace of mind today and order your InfoWars Power Pack from InfoWarsStore.com or dial 1-888-253-3139 and order today!
[03:00:10.447 --> 03:00:13.890]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:00:14.491 --> 03:00:16.212]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:31.169 --> 03:00:44.676]  But separately, I've got White House sources that say that Trump never knew until recently that indeed Kushner had met with the Russian ambassador early in the campaign, a year and a half ago.
[03:00:44.696 --> 03:00:47.737]  Or almost a year and a half ago, early 2016.
[03:00:47.797 --> 03:00:53.780]  We know the Russian bank met, but now it's the ambassador.
[03:00:53.820 --> 03:00:54.761]  That's a separate issue.
[03:00:55.341 --> 03:00:57.322]  Then we've got the other intel from the White House.
[03:00:59.545 --> 03:01:07.731]  That Rupert Murdoch has told Trump on a Sunday phone call, you need to fire almost everybody and stop this personnel takeover that's about to happen.
[03:01:08.752 --> 03:01:15.157]  And that Fox has been on the fence about all this, but now I think Fox sees a third of their viewers being lost.
[03:01:15.497 --> 03:01:20.600]  This claim by his sons they could convert to liberal garbage and still get their viewers failed.
[03:01:20.821 --> 03:01:24.864]  But all I was given was the Kushner information and the information about
[03:01:25.646 --> 03:01:27.588]  Well, I think that's all good advice.
[03:01:27.648 --> 03:01:33.753]  And I think what's happening with Murdoch is that Murdoch has realized that he's not going to capture a liberal audience.
[03:01:33.773 --> 03:01:34.553]  There is no liberal audience.
[03:01:34.994 --> 03:01:35.934]  MSNBC has got the entire audience.
[03:01:35.954 --> 03:01:37.936]  I mean, you know, when you think about it,
[03:01:53.107 --> 03:01:57.468]  Alex, you've got the leaders in the cable network drawing about 600,000 people.
[03:01:57.488 --> 03:02:02.249]  I mean, InfoWars is a major challenge on net streaming.
[03:02:02.269 --> 03:02:04.449]  We conservatively have a million viewers an hour.
[03:02:05.110 --> 03:02:05.730]  Precisely.
[03:02:06.350 --> 03:02:08.510]  And, you know, this is what's not recognized.
[03:02:08.590 --> 03:02:15.272]  The left between MSNBC and CNN, how are you going to get further left than these two?
[03:02:15.852 --> 03:02:21.513]  And the idea that you're going to have Sky News, which I've watched many times in Europe and in the Great Britain,
[03:02:22.370 --> 03:02:25.454]  It's okay, but it's international pablum.
[03:02:25.614 --> 03:02:31.160]  It's like listening to national public radio, all things considered.
[03:02:31.220 --> 03:02:34.344]  It's got a nice little sweet harmony to it.
[03:02:34.664 --> 03:02:36.806]  But it's not the news people want.
[03:02:37.307 --> 03:02:38.869]  People want Infowars.
[03:02:38.929 --> 03:02:42.613]  They want conservative libertarian analysis.
[03:02:42.633 --> 03:02:43.353]  They want the truth.
[03:02:44.054 --> 03:02:48.256]  And more importantly, they want real analysis, not being fed BS.
[03:02:48.716 --> 03:02:51.037]  We talk to the listeners just like it's us talking.
[03:02:51.577 --> 03:02:52.778]  High-level analysis.
[03:02:52.838 --> 03:02:55.459]  It's not, we tell you how it is like you're five years old.
[03:02:55.659 --> 03:02:56.599]  Not hive mind.
[03:02:57.120 --> 03:03:01.542]  What I'm giving you here, these articles I'm gonna write, is the most internal
[03:03:03.030 --> 03:03:13.297]  Highly classified generally, except I'm not using classified information, but these are techniques that were developed by the CIA, by the State Department, by intelligence agencies going back to the 50s and 60s.
[03:03:13.317 --> 03:03:17.000]  I was about to say, I mean, I knew you did a lot of this work, but I never, why are you telling people now?
[03:03:17.020 --> 03:03:18.221]  It shows how much trouble the country's in.
[03:03:19.127 --> 03:03:26.572]  Well, I'm telling you, I'm bringing it out today because I think if Trump doesn't understand these principles, the left will have him impeached.
[03:03:27.092 --> 03:03:31.715]  Because they're using the techniques... And that's what Colonel Schaeffer, who knows this classified stuff, said as well.
[03:03:31.735 --> 03:03:35.277]  He said, we're in a total info war, they plan to bring him down, he's got to fight back.
[03:03:36.198 --> 03:03:38.979]  And he's got to fight back with techniques that work.
[03:03:39.580 --> 03:03:45.383]  Not just, you know, yes, let's bring out the truth, let's counter all this with the fact that, you know, Hillary, etc.
[03:03:45.563 --> 03:03:48.025]  But Comey has not ever
[03:03:48.860 --> 03:03:50.541]  Prosecuted a single leaker.
[03:03:51.242 --> 03:03:52.823]  Okay, there's been dozens of them.
[03:03:53.223 --> 03:03:54.484]  It's a politicalization.
[03:03:54.504 --> 03:03:56.766]  But we are coming down to George Washington level disinfo.
[03:03:56.886 --> 03:03:58.287]  I've never used disinfo or lies.
[03:03:58.647 --> 03:03:59.868]  The country's on its last legs.
[03:04:00.109 --> 03:04:01.950]  The Democrats admit they're using lies.
[03:04:01.990 --> 03:04:02.931]  They've said that in the New York Times.
[03:04:03.371 --> 03:04:07.934]  Are you saying we're finally getting to the point where we just absolutely take the gloves off at that point?
[03:04:08.615 --> 03:04:13.679]  Yeah, we're taking the gloves off by beating them with techniques that they have no way to respond to.
[03:04:14.696 --> 03:04:22.843]  In other words, rather than playing their game, we're going to use what's been proved over 50 or 60 years to be the only way to counter propaganda.
[03:04:23.424 --> 03:04:25.005]  The Democrats are just like the Nazis.
[03:04:25.045 --> 03:04:26.607]  They're engaged in a propaganda tactic.
[03:04:26.647 --> 03:04:26.827]  They are.
[03:04:26.847 --> 03:04:27.227]  They really are.
[03:04:28.008 --> 03:04:29.029]  It's disinformation.
[03:04:29.069 --> 03:04:31.491]  It's the same thing the Russians did, Soviets did.
[03:04:31.591 --> 03:04:32.732]  It's disinformation.
[03:04:33.253 --> 03:04:35.094]  And disinformation is very powerful.
[03:04:35.715 --> 03:04:36.916]  And it's very tough to defeat.
[03:04:37.591 --> 03:04:38.952]  You have to use the right techniques.
[03:04:39.433 --> 03:04:41.535]  They want you to argue with it on facts.
[03:04:42.156 --> 03:04:44.638]  They want you to say there's no information to prove it.
[03:04:44.919 --> 03:04:45.980]  That won't stop them.
[03:04:46.500 --> 03:04:48.943]  That just fuels... It's like a slow oris attack.
[03:04:48.963 --> 03:04:54.929]  They just keep repeating the lie and make you... they control you by making you and Judo engage them to 11 a.m.
[03:04:55.170 --> 03:04:55.630]  12 noon tomorrow.
[03:04:55.670 --> 03:04:56.771]  Dr. Corsi, we can't wait.
[03:04:57.032 --> 03:04:57.892]  Thank you so much, doctor.
[03:05:00.660 --> 03:05:12.344]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:05:12.924 --> 03:05:14.985]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[03:05:15.185 --> 03:05:18.006]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:05:18.446 --> 03:05:19.647]  It's made in the USA.
[03:05:20.387 --> 03:05:28.774]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the InfoWars.
[03:05:29.114 --> 03:05:31.076]  It is a classical 360 win.
[03:05:31.576 --> 03:05:35.400]  Our formula at InfoWarsLife.com is quite frankly simple.
[03:05:36.060 --> 03:05:42.606]  We go out and look at the recognized research and we take it to the next level of quality, of purity,
[03:05:43.680 --> 03:05:43.900]  I think?
[03:06:05.874 --> 03:06:06.014]  What's
[03:06:25.538 --> 03:06:35.360]  You owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world, that patriots stay as healthy, and as clean, and as focused as you can be.
[03:06:35.420 --> 03:06:43.682]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level, and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:06:43.882 --> 03:06:50.503]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the New World Order.
[03:06:51.616 --> 03:06:55.400]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[03:06:55.860 --> 03:06:57.182]  Now it's time to change our bodies.
[03:06:57.842 --> 03:07:00.245]  With Z-Shield and InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:07:00.965 --> 03:07:05.189]  Men, give your body the support it needs with InfoWars Life Prostagard.
[03:07:05.710 --> 03:07:09.494]  It's time to start assisting the body in regulating proper prostate balance.

[03:07:38.669 --> 03:07:42.092]  Prostagard is something that the men on the InfoWars crew take every day.
[03:07:42.332 --> 03:07:48.978]  And from our research, it's something that men should really be adding to their daily regimen in order to keep their body going at optimal levels.
[03:07:49.438 --> 03:07:52.561]  Now's the time to start naturally supporting your body.

[03:08:11.084 --> 03:08:13.207]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:08:13.748 --> 03:08:19.016]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[03:08:21.149 --> 03:08:27.293]  Yeah, the White House sources today green-lighted me to talk about something I learned a few days ago, and I was given a lot of other information.
[03:08:27.313 --> 03:08:29.675]  I want to have phone calls before I release all this.
[03:08:30.276 --> 03:08:33.918]  Jared Kusher met with a Russian ambassador during transition, White House officials say.
[03:08:34.398 --> 03:08:36.960]  That's the LA Times, and this comes from a few months ago.
[03:08:37.481 --> 03:08:41.604]  But Trump, he lied to Trump purportedly, and said this wasn't true.
[03:08:42.364 --> 03:08:43.865]  Then Trump got briefed a few weeks ago.
[03:08:43.885 --> 03:08:44.466]  That was the case.
[03:08:44.486 --> 03:08:47.508]  That's why you haven't seen Kushner back at his side or back.
[03:08:47.968 --> 03:08:51.270]  I mean, Trump has just been betrayed by all these weak personalities.
[03:08:52.792 --> 03:08:53.832]  And Trump's totally surrounded.
[03:08:53.872 --> 03:08:57.235]  Mike Cernovich, we're riding shotgun for one more segment and then we're gonna let him take over.
[03:08:57.715 --> 03:09:05.360]  Owens Troyer and myself broke all this down that they are about to kick out all the new people that were transitional, that they haven't gotten security clearances, you name it.
[03:09:06.443 --> 03:09:16.939]  So he's going to recap all of that, but talking to Corsi earlier about how you counter complete lies when they don't care what the facts are, they keep moving forward.
[03:09:17.339 --> 03:09:19.382]  Is this being done out of a desperation move?
[03:09:19.903 --> 03:09:20.924]  A and then B, Cernovich?
[03:09:22.335 --> 03:09:24.035]  Mike Cernovich joins us, co-hosting.
[03:09:24.596 --> 03:09:26.216]  What happens if they win?
[03:09:26.336 --> 03:09:28.737]  I mean, they've said, shut down the free press.
[03:09:30.257 --> 03:09:34.618]  They've said in major publications, we're going to have a new election run by COG.
[03:09:35.398 --> 03:09:36.679]  Congress isn't legitimate.
[03:09:36.799 --> 03:09:38.659]  The shadow government declares Congress illegitimate.
[03:09:38.999 --> 03:09:40.299]  They're run by the Russians, they claim.
[03:09:40.720 --> 03:09:42.880]  We have new elections run by Homeland Security.
[03:09:42.920 --> 03:09:46.501]  Anyone who was elected, who's a Republican, of course, they lose their seat.
[03:09:47.001 --> 03:09:48.241]  This is all being proposed.
[03:09:48.281 --> 03:09:50.182]  This is outrageous!
[03:09:50.942 --> 03:09:52.003]  This is outrageous.
[03:09:52.203 --> 03:10:18.304]  Everyone in Congress, everyone who has half a brain knows, you do not roll over to this, which by an out-of-power party that almost everyone hates, that's losing all the state houses, that is about to become a regional party on the coastlines, who is in crisis, but you've got so many wimpy Republicans, they want to be the ones that are left alone, the Glenn Becks everybody, and the Megyn Kellys, and so, and the, you know,
[03:10:18.704 --> 03:10:21.607]  Paul Ryan's that they are going along with this.
[03:10:22.227 --> 03:10:25.550]  Trump has to understand offense is the best defense.
[03:10:25.590 --> 03:10:26.231]  Mike Cernovich.
[03:10:27.212 --> 03:10:31.395]  Yes, I was actually talking to John and my lovely wife.
[03:10:31.435 --> 03:10:34.058]  We were watching Get Me Roger Stone for the third time.
[03:10:34.578 --> 03:10:39.803]  And I noticed something that every highlight in that movie about the really effective moves Trump's made.
[03:10:40.623 --> 03:10:42.525]  Didn't come from his official campaign.
[03:10:42.925 --> 03:10:45.347]  Bringing the rape victims of Bill Clinton to the debate.
[03:10:45.787 --> 03:10:47.229]  That didn't come from the campaign.
[03:10:47.569 --> 03:10:48.810]  Exposing Hillary's health.
[03:10:49.210 --> 03:10:50.791]  That came from Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:10:50.852 --> 03:10:51.872]  And you.
[03:10:52.393 --> 03:10:53.374]  No, it all came from us.
[03:10:53.394 --> 03:10:54.334]  It all came from the grassroots.
[03:10:55.175 --> 03:10:57.237]  Right, nothing came from his actual team.
[03:10:57.257 --> 03:10:59.158]  And by the way, we don't want credit.
[03:10:59.238 --> 03:11:00.720]  We're just pointing out what works.
[03:11:01.400 --> 03:11:04.543]  We're not trying to hide our political skill with the truth.
[03:11:04.583 --> 03:11:05.544]  We're saying use it!
[03:11:06.749 --> 03:11:14.513]  Well, that's the whole point, is actually I was talking to somebody earlier, a reporter who's doing a big story on General Flynn, and she goes, do you have a comment?
[03:11:14.553 --> 03:11:17.435]  And I said, we're still talking about General Flynn.
[03:11:17.955 --> 03:11:22.397]  Six months later, firing General Flynn was Trump's first catastrophic mistake.
[03:11:22.457 --> 03:11:23.418]  It showed weakness.
[03:11:23.918 --> 03:11:28.301]  It showed him that we will let the fake news media dictate personnel.
[03:11:28.341 --> 03:11:29.841]  That was a catastrophic error.
[03:11:30.182 --> 03:11:31.983]  That was like smashing into the line.
[03:11:32.303 --> 03:11:33.864]  You don't give these people an inch.
[03:11:34.244 --> 03:11:34.964]  You double down.
[03:11:34.984 --> 03:11:36.145]  That was putting blood in the water.
[03:11:37.011 --> 03:11:39.552]  Yeah, and ever since then it's been downhill.
[03:11:39.692 --> 03:11:43.973]  Ever since they fired General Flynn, it has been blow after blow after blow.
[03:11:44.453 --> 03:11:49.515]  And it's frustrating for people like us, truth tellers, to know that we could run things.
[03:11:50.155 --> 03:11:52.136]  All they have to do is do what we tell them to do.
[03:11:52.396 --> 03:11:53.696]  I don't want to go work for Trump.
[03:11:53.816 --> 03:11:54.956]  I could not work for him.
[03:11:55.297 --> 03:11:56.617]  I don't like to work for anybody.
[03:11:57.778 --> 03:11:59.279]  I could tell them what to do.
[03:11:59.619 --> 03:12:00.840]  All they have to do is listen to us.
[03:12:01.200 --> 03:12:02.241]  Quit apologizing.
[03:12:02.381 --> 03:12:04.902]  Because we don't come from the inside, just like he's in business.
[03:12:05.242 --> 03:12:06.483]  We just want the country back.
[03:12:06.863 --> 03:12:10.665]  We actually study how it works, not how all the, you know, butt-kissing goes on.
[03:12:10.805 --> 03:12:11.366]  Well, that's it.
[03:12:11.526 --> 03:12:12.446]  You asked Mike.
[03:12:12.466 --> 03:12:15.488]  You said, what does it mean if they win?
[03:12:16.068 --> 03:12:17.609]  It means we've lost our country.
[03:12:17.969 --> 03:12:19.470]  It means we're not in control anymore.
[03:12:19.810 --> 03:12:23.452]  It means that we have a continuity of government that's taken over for the Republic.
[03:12:23.773 --> 03:12:24.413]  That's what it means.
[03:12:24.713 --> 03:12:31.378]  And it says we're all suspect Russians when they're the multinational force, the outside alien force, effing us over.
[03:12:31.458 --> 03:12:33.219]  And that's why it pisses me off so much.
[03:12:33.239 --> 03:12:36.461]  That's why it pisses you off so much because here we are, fighting for the country.
[03:12:36.781 --> 03:12:40.223]  It shouldn't matter if you're a Republican or a Democrat or a Liberal or a Conservative.
[03:12:40.463 --> 03:12:41.244]  It shouldn't matter!
[03:12:41.264 --> 03:12:43.886]  These people are trying to take our Republic away!
[03:12:43.906 --> 03:12:45.727]  They're trying to undermine a vote!
[03:12:46.881 --> 03:12:47.662]  Exactly, Owen.
[03:12:47.722 --> 03:12:53.747]  And if you want to know how overwhelmingly authoritarian they are, they got a good shot at winning peacefully, but they want their underground revolution ready.
[03:12:53.967 --> 03:12:58.931]  Their main operating system is kill cops randomly while they pump gas or write somebody a speeding ticket.
[03:12:59.952 --> 03:13:01.393]  And people go, oh, you kissed the cop's ass now.
[03:13:01.693 --> 03:13:06.615]  I got a lot of problems with cops, I don't want to randomly blow their heads off for no reason, like any other, you know, group I don't want to kill.
[03:13:06.855 --> 03:13:15.717]  I mean, this is such a lawless scumbag group, and we're supposed to sit here, and I'm just saying this, I'm not looking for trouble, I don't want authoritarian stuff like they do, I want a win-free market.
[03:13:15.957 --> 03:13:17.698]  But if they think, let me just extrapolate.
[03:13:18.158 --> 03:13:21.281]  If they think they lost this election, they have some coup d'etat, they take over.
[03:13:21.501 --> 03:13:23.463]  They're actually trying to grab all of us and stuff.
[03:13:23.763 --> 03:13:25.625]  They have no idea what's going to happen.
[03:13:25.845 --> 03:13:29.208]  They've taken our restraint for weakness, when it's not, it's strength.
[03:13:29.548 --> 03:13:32.151]  And let me tell you, they're going to lose anyway you slice it.
[03:13:32.171 --> 03:13:33.372]  I want you to talk about that, Owen, and then...
[03:13:33.912 --> 03:13:41.016]  Well, like I said, I think that the numbers of the never-Trumpers, the people out protesting in the street, they're getting fewer and far between.
[03:13:41.316 --> 03:13:42.036]  They're dwindling.
[03:13:42.437 --> 03:13:43.677]  We have to push forward.
[03:13:43.957 --> 03:13:45.258]  We have to have Trump's back.
[03:13:45.538 --> 03:13:46.999]  Trump is going to do what he's going to do.
[03:13:47.019 --> 03:13:48.040]  He's going to be in the swamp.
[03:13:48.080 --> 03:13:49.000]  He's dealing with these people.
[03:13:49.380 --> 03:13:50.741]  We have to do what we have to do.
[03:13:50.781 --> 03:13:51.982]  We have to elect the right people.
[03:13:52.162 --> 03:13:53.502]  We have to get the truth out there.
[03:13:53.682 --> 03:13:54.843]  And that's what Mike is talking about.
[03:13:54.863 --> 03:13:55.704]  We ought to be armies of one.
[03:13:55.744 --> 03:13:59.806]  And this morning, I was making phone calls to my different congressional sources, military sources.
[03:14:00.766 --> 03:14:06.110]  And I was sitting there and I was talking to this, you know, one fella, and I said, what do we do?
[03:14:06.130 --> 03:14:09.933]  And he goes, exactly what Cernovich said a month ago at dinner with you.
[03:14:11.594 --> 03:14:14.576]  And the fella that was there, he goes, we hit the streets, we get aggressive.
[03:14:14.596 --> 03:14:15.436]  We have to realize, we have the power.
[03:14:15.456 --> 03:14:19.699]  And you know what, if we don't do that, and we're not looking for trouble, but a liberal punches us in the face, we break their nose.
[03:14:19.779 --> 03:14:20.280]  We have the power.
[03:14:20.300 --> 03:14:27.885]  You know, it's time to get aggressive in defense and to stop rolling over and giving all these little beta males the signal that we're going to roll over.
[03:14:28.005 --> 03:14:28.505]  No, we're not.
[03:14:30.188 --> 03:14:39.794]  Yeah, I'm at the point now, I'm actually writing an article, and this might bother a lot of people who watch me and watch you, but my loyalty has never been to Trump.
[03:14:39.834 --> 03:14:48.400]  My loyalty is to people who are supporting you on InfoWarsTore.com, the people who are reading great books like Guerrilla Mindset, the people who want the truth.
[03:14:48.920 --> 03:14:53.423]  And I'm actually writing an article called, Is the Movement Moving On From Trump?
[03:14:53.484 --> 03:14:55.425]  And a lot of people might not want to hear that.
[03:14:56.025 --> 03:14:58.628]  But I'm sick of these beta males he has in the White House.
[03:14:58.668 --> 03:14:59.228]  No, we should.
[03:14:59.268 --> 03:15:00.409]  We should have a discussion.
[03:15:00.429 --> 03:15:02.431]  Because Trump's only a vehicle of liberty.
[03:15:02.932 --> 03:15:03.532]  And we love him.
[03:15:03.552 --> 03:15:04.013]  That's great.
[03:15:04.233 --> 03:15:05.154]  But we're not stopping.
[03:15:05.174 --> 03:15:06.055]  We're running for office.
[03:15:06.075 --> 03:15:07.016]  We're politically involved.
[03:15:07.256 --> 03:15:08.117]  We're writing books.
[03:15:08.357 --> 03:15:10.379]  We're not rolling over to a bunch of dumbasses.
[03:15:11.513 --> 03:15:12.214]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:15:12.254 --> 03:15:20.920]  So I'm working on it because one thing I noticed is I threw the biggest event of Inauguration Week, the Deplora Ball, and everybody was like, Trump, Trump!
[03:15:20.980 --> 03:15:22.221]  It became a mini rally.
[03:15:22.581 --> 03:15:25.263]  Then I threw another big event in D.C., the Bull Moose Party.
[03:15:25.604 --> 03:15:26.965]  Very, very, very pro-Trump.
[03:15:27.425 --> 03:15:35.411]  Then I attended a recent event in D.C., the Real News Party, hosted by Gateway Pundit Jim Hoft, who, by the way, really likes you and, you know, we should talk to him one day.
[03:15:35.431 --> 03:15:36.051]  He's a great guy.
[03:15:36.071 --> 03:15:36.632]  Charles, get him on.
[03:15:37.598 --> 03:15:47.052]  And the enthusiasm for Trump is waning and what I heard from people talking to me is they go, they're looking for leadership and they actually go, Cernovich, you know, I don't know what Trump's doing.
[03:15:47.172 --> 03:15:48.374]  What are we going to do now?
[03:15:48.494 --> 03:15:49.275]  Let me stop you.
[03:15:49.375 --> 03:15:49.636]  Exactly.
[03:15:49.656 --> 03:15:52.700]  If I'm selling 500 Trump shirts a day, they get down to 40, 50.
[03:15:54.332 --> 03:15:56.313]  But the thing is, he's the winner patriot.
[03:15:56.353 --> 03:15:57.514]  He's trying to get stuff done.
[03:15:57.554 --> 03:15:58.254]  He's under attack.
[03:15:58.575 --> 03:16:00.035]  It isn't all just magical now.
[03:16:00.316 --> 03:16:05.619]  It's not that we need Trump as the vehicle, because if they bring him down, they're going to have the bureaucracy and the executive.
[03:16:05.899 --> 03:16:09.921]  We need to hold him up as long as possible, or hopefully longer, strategically.
[03:16:10.021 --> 03:16:12.623]  I get it's not as fun and trendy now to be pro-Trump.
[03:16:12.663 --> 03:16:18.747]  This is the time to be pro-Trump while we run for office, while we launch new websites, and while we run other operations.
[03:16:19.067 --> 03:16:22.169]  I'm telling you, my gut tells me, Mike, we've got to prop Trump up.
[03:16:23.066 --> 03:16:24.907]  Well, he's got to come to us too, Alex.
[03:16:25.287 --> 03:16:26.287]  That's the reality.
[03:16:26.547 --> 03:16:28.788]  The reality is we got him elected.
[03:16:29.288 --> 03:16:30.489]  We push the stories.
[03:16:30.769 --> 03:16:31.910]  We dictate the narrative.
[03:16:32.150 --> 03:16:33.370]  We drive the news cycle.
[03:16:33.630 --> 03:16:36.131]  Media Matters has people watching right now.
[03:16:36.151 --> 03:16:38.772]  They've transcribed every conversation we have.
[03:16:38.792 --> 03:16:40.393]  They download every video.
[03:16:40.633 --> 03:16:42.934]  They're not afraid of the White House communications team.
[03:16:43.134 --> 03:16:45.095]  They're not afraid of what's coming out of Sean's face.
[03:16:45.135 --> 03:16:46.915]  They're afraid of us.
[03:16:46.935 --> 03:16:47.736]  They're afraid of us.
[03:16:48.496 --> 03:16:50.399]  Well why aren't we pushing the message?
[03:16:51.200 --> 03:16:55.326]  So if Trump doesn't want to listen to us, look, I'm nobody's squire.
[03:16:55.546 --> 03:16:56.367]  No, no, I agree with you.
[03:16:56.407 --> 03:17:00.293]  We need to get our message out to everybody and not just make it Trumpy and we don't rise and fall with Trump.
[03:17:00.774 --> 03:17:03.017]  All I'm saying is the enemy wants to bring him down.
[03:17:05.077 --> 03:17:06.459]  You said we need a bloody Trump.
[03:17:06.539 --> 03:17:08.842]  Only a bloody Trump will save America.
[03:17:23.288 --> 03:17:23.908]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:17:23.988 --> 03:17:25.389]  I'm glad he got punched in the face.
[03:17:25.649 --> 03:17:28.190]  He can get punched in the face more, and then he goes, well, wait a minute.
[03:17:28.210 --> 03:17:29.490]  Where did Cernovich go?
[03:17:29.510 --> 03:17:30.410]  Where did Alex Jones go?
[03:17:30.430 --> 03:17:31.350]  Where did Roger Stone go?
[03:17:31.370 --> 03:17:32.091]  Where did the base go?
[03:17:32.111 --> 03:17:33.131]  Where did my Twitter people go?
[03:17:33.411 --> 03:17:40.833]  And he's going to look around and see a bunch of beta males around him, vile grovelers who grovel like worms to the media.
[03:17:41.334 --> 03:17:43.834]  And then he's going to realize, all right, man, it's time to get real.
[03:17:44.114 --> 03:17:45.815]  It's time to bring in the real fighters.
[03:17:46.075 --> 03:17:47.776]  Time to get the real soldiers in the game.
[03:17:48.076 --> 03:17:49.336]  That is going to be how we're going to win.
[03:17:49.376 --> 03:17:50.216]  Well, make no mistake.
[03:17:50.276 --> 03:17:51.997]  Soros knows we're the enemy.
[03:17:52.617 --> 03:17:55.038]  They know we can't be bought, we don't back down.
[03:17:55.078 --> 03:17:56.458]  I'm not a scumbag like them.
[03:17:56.979 --> 03:17:58.319]  I'm not even that good of a person.
[03:17:58.359 --> 03:17:59.339]  I'm not out to hurt people.
[03:17:59.980 --> 03:18:04.061]  I'm not signing on to the Muslims, cutting women's genitals off and raping everybody and putting hoods on heads.
[03:18:04.101 --> 03:18:04.601]  I'm done!
[03:18:04.621 --> 03:18:06.402]  There's only so far I'll put up with.
[03:18:06.422 --> 03:18:09.703]  The thing is, it's very empowering to not care anymore.
[03:18:10.023 --> 03:18:12.844]  It's very empowering to just say, the line is in the sand.
[03:18:14.545 --> 03:18:21.732]  I'm just telling you, Trump is so surrounded by scum and liars, and I'm just telling you we need to pray for Trump, because he's a figurehead.
[03:18:21.772 --> 03:18:30.559]  But I get the fact we need to get our message out, but explain, hey, he's not perfect, we're not a Trump movement, but he needs... So I think in between what you're saying and what I'm saying, we kind of need to find a middle ground.
[03:18:30.579 --> 03:18:31.340]  You got any comments on that?
[03:18:32.361 --> 03:18:34.444]  I was just curious, Mike, I actually had a question for you.
[03:18:34.504 --> 03:18:48.602]  I'm sure that you're going to be breaking down John DiStofano later on the John Boehner holdover, but I'm curious, this story was just published on the Washington Examiner that Trump is considering Joe Lieberman for FBI Director.
[03:18:48.762 --> 03:18:50.485]  I'm curious if you have any intel on that.
[03:18:51.833 --> 03:18:56.436]  I haven't heard yet that they're keeping that really, they don't want people to know who's that going to be.
[03:18:56.456 --> 03:18:58.717]  So I haven't heard any information like that.
[03:18:58.737 --> 03:19:00.357]  But look, here's the thing.
[03:19:00.698 --> 03:19:01.178]  Here's the thing.
[03:19:01.198 --> 03:19:02.379]  You know, Alex, I love you.
[03:19:02.439 --> 03:19:04.039]  You know, I love the people listening in.
[03:19:04.740 --> 03:19:07.561]  Trump is a, he's a billionaire alpha male.
[03:19:07.961 --> 03:19:10.803]  I don't want to hear that Trump is surrounded by these scum.
[03:19:11.343 --> 03:19:12.323]  Hey, he's got to own it.
[03:19:12.424 --> 03:19:14.724]  He's got to look around and say, these people are pathetic.
[03:19:15.045 --> 03:19:17.726]  I can't be around the stench of these people.
[03:19:18.026 --> 03:19:19.426]  I need to bring in the real players.
[03:19:19.446 --> 03:19:20.187]  I need to bring in the real people.
[03:19:20.227 --> 03:19:20.667]  Here's the problem.
[03:19:20.687 --> 03:19:21.427]  He doesn't know.
[03:19:21.487 --> 03:19:24.128]  And a Lieberman will say, I will be loyal, Mr. President.
[03:19:24.148 --> 03:19:35.033]  But I think there also could be another angle here where he's trying to drain the swamp by putting out fake intel leaks like this, saying, yeah, you know, I'm considering Joe Lieberman.
[03:19:35.313 --> 03:19:37.674]  And then that little rat runs out and tells the media.
[03:19:37.894 --> 03:19:39.675]  And then he's like, boom, caught ya.
[03:19:39.975 --> 03:19:44.599]  No, I agree, he did that, that's what he was doing with the whole thing with Mitt Romney.
[03:19:44.779 --> 03:19:48.182]  Yeah, and he did that with, I think he's done that with a couple other things as well.
[03:19:48.423 --> 03:19:52.426]  Well, let's just not forget, Trump killed TPP, he has cut the U.N.
[03:19:52.446 --> 03:19:54.928]  funding by half, he's got $3 trillion in the stock market.
[03:19:55.149 --> 03:20:00.934]  What message does that send, Cernovich, that the stock market went down massively the day after they tried to impeach him?
[03:20:02.295 --> 03:20:03.195]  Well, that's the thing.
[03:20:03.495 --> 03:20:12.398]  That is why, again, we keep circling back to this point, which is, I will never regret what we did for Trump, and I'll always be proud of what we did.
[03:20:12.718 --> 03:20:16.379]  We saved, we gave the world a little bit, a couple more years maybe.
[03:20:16.419 --> 03:20:18.179]  Hillary Clinton, we'd already be in World War III.
[03:20:18.499 --> 03:20:19.800]  The Supreme Court would be ruined.
[03:20:20.160 --> 03:20:23.681]  There would be hasty... Sure, we did it for the right reason, and it bears some good fruit, but it's not perfect.
[03:20:24.281 --> 03:20:24.762]  Exactly.
[03:20:25.042 --> 03:20:31.828]  The flip side to that, though, is the revolution's over May 23rd if these temporary employees aren't made permanent.
[03:20:32.328 --> 03:20:36.472]  And Johnny DeStefano, actually, I sent an article to the, you know, Nico, who's just amazing.
[03:20:36.492 --> 03:20:37.573]  You know, the whole team is amazing.
[03:20:38.113 --> 03:20:43.418]  He even wrote an article in USA Today saying, well, we're taking our time because we want the best people.
[03:20:43.799 --> 03:20:45.340]  No, he's stalling it out.
[03:20:45.360 --> 03:20:47.342]  Because he knows they've got Obama people already in.
[03:20:47.962 --> 03:20:48.763]  Exactly, right.
[03:20:49.083 --> 03:20:54.428]  And McMaster, I'd actually, um, another article, make Democrat, or make the NFC Democrat again.
[03:20:55.009 --> 03:21:00.253]  McMaster has been remaking the National Security Council into a Democratic stronghold.
[03:21:00.734 --> 03:21:01.955]  Hey man, this is all happening.
[03:21:02.355 --> 03:21:04.397]  Alright, I'm not going to- Hey, did you get any more intel on McMaster?
[03:21:04.417 --> 03:21:06.119]  Because ours was, it was NSA leaked.
[03:21:06.179 --> 03:21:07.380]  We think McMaster's the guy.
[03:21:07.700 --> 03:21:08.381]  Who is the leaker?
[03:21:08.401 --> 03:21:09.262]  Was it him or a staffer?
[03:21:10.168 --> 03:21:14.250]  It was McMaster because he's the only person who had all of the details that was needed.
[03:21:14.570 --> 03:21:22.893]  So that story is a huge one because what was leaked, because you know, you called me, we talked right when that story broke and you were like, what's your take on it?
[03:21:23.493 --> 03:21:28.975]  And I told you, well, I called around to all my sources and everybody was freaking out and I'll tell you why they were freaking out.
[03:21:29.702 --> 03:21:33.426]  Trump didn't talk about what was leaked to the Washington Post.
[03:21:33.766 --> 03:21:39.012]  So what was leaked to the Washington Post was actually a major national security breach.
[03:21:39.332 --> 03:21:41.594]  There's a big investigation going on right now.
[03:21:41.674 --> 03:21:45.639]  It's a huge one because that was actually national security risk.
[03:21:46.079 --> 03:21:46.840]  That's right.
[03:21:46.860 --> 03:21:50.604]  What they leaked Trump supposedly did was real intel, but Trump didn't leak it.
[03:21:51.465 --> 03:21:57.527]  No, Trump said, Trump in the meeting goes, hey did you guys know that there's a plot to put bombs on your laptops?
[03:21:57.807 --> 03:22:00.148]  That's been in a thousand newspapers for two months.
[03:22:00.548 --> 03:22:00.768]  Right.
[03:22:01.208 --> 03:22:03.809]  He didn't leak where he got it because he didn't know.
[03:22:04.429 --> 03:22:05.410]  He was never ready for that.
[03:22:05.430 --> 03:22:09.691]  But instead they leaked where we got it to further burn him, to make it look like he gave out that intel.
[03:22:09.971 --> 03:22:11.832]  And again, that's why he's pissed at Comey.
[03:22:12.092 --> 03:22:14.933]  Comey would never go after them because he's a Democratic Party butt boy.
[03:22:16.448 --> 03:22:17.169]  Exactly right.
[03:22:17.289 --> 03:22:26.135]  So what was leaked to the Washington Post had everybody I talked to, they were rattled because they said, Cernovich, this is going to damage our relationship with our partners.
[03:22:26.515 --> 03:22:28.396]  But Trump didn't leak it.
[03:22:28.476 --> 03:22:29.977]  Trump didn't have those details.
[03:22:30.057 --> 03:22:33.820]  No president is given that granular detail about every raid.
[03:22:33.860 --> 03:22:34.420]  You couldn't get it.
[03:22:34.460 --> 03:22:35.081]  You just like you.
[03:22:35.161 --> 03:22:37.162]  I mean, you have 65 employees.
[03:22:37.462 --> 03:22:40.404]  There could be people in some broom closet right now doing God knows what.
[03:22:40.704 --> 03:22:40.864]  Right.
[03:22:40.884 --> 03:22:44.047]  You can't keep track of every detail of everything that happens in every day.
[03:22:44.347 --> 03:22:45.427]  Same thing with the president.
[03:22:45.447 --> 03:22:46.028]  So he's not
[03:22:46.288 --> 03:22:46.508]  He's
[03:23:01.325 --> 03:23:02.726]  I get we go forward with our movement.
[03:23:03.146 --> 03:23:04.888]  They are not going to just let us sit here.
[03:23:04.928 --> 03:23:05.888]  They want to destroy us.
[03:23:06.229 --> 03:23:07.630]  So, in a way, he's like a shield.
[03:23:08.090 --> 03:23:09.231]  I'm not throwing the shield down.
[03:23:09.251 --> 03:23:11.292]  I mean, he's actually self-serving, I'll be honest.
[03:23:11.833 --> 03:23:14.094]  My defense of the President is for my own family.
[03:23:14.315 --> 03:23:16.196]  Do people not get he's like the storm wall?
[03:23:16.736 --> 03:23:17.937]  I mean, you know, we need him.
[03:23:18.938 --> 03:23:20.519]  Well, I was going to leave the country, actually.
[03:23:20.980 --> 03:23:24.422]  If Hillary Clinton had won, I would not be living in America because it wouldn't have saved me.
[03:23:24.442 --> 03:23:28.445]  Well, I didn't want to, but I was advised by high-level sources that that was where they were going to greenlight stuff against me.
[03:23:28.465 --> 03:23:30.507]  I know multiple veterans that were going to do the same.
[03:23:31.380 --> 03:23:33.721]  So again, don't we defend Trump because he's the storm wall?
[03:23:34.661 --> 03:23:42.563]  Oh, again, I'm not anti-Trump, but the flip side to that is it is our job to, in leadership, right?
[03:23:42.723 --> 03:23:46.764]  Our job is to also hold our leaders accountable and let them know, hey, I'm not some stooge.
[03:23:46.924 --> 03:23:48.224]  Alex Jones isn't your stooge.
[03:23:48.244 --> 03:23:53.445]  No, no, we're not rubber stamps like the Democrats that don't care if Hillary's a warmonger or, you know, ripping people off in Haiti.
[03:23:53.525 --> 03:23:54.265]  I mean, I get it.
[03:23:54.686 --> 03:23:56.226]  I'm just saying Trump's done so much good.
[03:23:57.816 --> 03:24:01.305]  That, I mean, I can't even run my own life half the time, and I'm pretty well-competent and focused.
[03:24:01.345 --> 03:24:02.468]  I can't imagine how he's doing it.
[03:24:02.488 --> 03:24:05.014]  I mean, look as he has a bunch of desirable trash.
[03:24:05.885 --> 03:24:14.392]  Look at the difference between the Democrats, and Trump said this constantly during his campaign, saying, I'm so much smarter than these people, I'm not even bragging, these people are just dumb, they're not very smart.
[03:24:14.732 --> 03:24:17.455]  Look at, it's so clear to me, look at the Democrats, okay.
[03:24:18.035 --> 03:24:21.618]  Trump has a meeting, and he's talking, he says, hey guys, have you heard?
[03:24:21.698 --> 03:24:27.423]  They're putting bombs in laptops now, they're making battery bombs, they're putting them in laptops, this is crazy, what's going on?
[03:24:27.463 --> 03:24:29.124]  He just kind of brings it up in jest.
[03:24:29.424 --> 03:24:31.906]  Democrats freak out, they raise their, throw their hands in there, oh my God!
[03:24:31.946 --> 03:24:33.728]  They didn't even know I've been on the news for two months.
[03:24:33.948 --> 03:24:36.618]  Meanwhile, this is how smart Trump is.
[03:24:37.119 --> 03:24:37.440]  Trump!
[03:24:38.322 --> 03:24:45.625]  Puts out a message saying, boy, I hope that James Comey doesn't put out his notes because I've got tapes.
[03:24:46.485 --> 03:24:46.885]  Boom!
[03:24:47.025 --> 03:24:47.885]  He just checkmated.
[03:24:47.905 --> 03:24:48.746]  Three days before.
[03:24:48.886 --> 03:24:49.426]  Checkmate!
[03:24:49.646 --> 03:24:51.407]  James Comey just got checkmated.
[03:24:51.827 --> 03:24:55.148]  And then I think, I'm telling you, Trump is putting out fake leaks to find holes in his ship.
[03:24:55.928 --> 03:25:00.410]  Trump, again, whether you like him or not, he is so much smarter than his opposition.
[03:25:00.430 --> 03:25:00.770]  I love him.
[03:25:01.070 --> 03:25:03.491]  And he is just crushing them on the ground level.
[03:25:03.671 --> 03:25:04.991]  Yeah, so Cernovich, what about that?
[03:25:05.071 --> 03:25:06.792]  What about how he's showing the leaks?
[03:25:07.941 --> 03:25:12.486]  Is Sheriff Clark actually, I just got a text message, Sheriff Clark might be joining the administration.
[03:25:12.906 --> 03:25:13.787]  Is that breaking news?
[03:25:13.807 --> 03:25:15.129]  Let's look it up.
[03:25:15.589 --> 03:25:16.450]  That's Google Sheriff Clark.
[03:25:16.530 --> 03:25:20.895]  I'm getting information from sources that Sheriff Clark... Well all I know is you heard this too.
[03:25:20.995 --> 03:25:22.897]  Trump's planning this giant purge.
[03:25:23.217 --> 03:25:25.520]  You say though the purge is already happening by the enemy below.
[03:25:25.820 --> 03:25:27.402]  How will those two purges interact?
[03:25:28.905 --> 03:25:29.586]  Well, I don't know.
[03:25:29.786 --> 03:25:39.155]  If it's true about Sheriff Clark joining the administration, then that would be Trump doing what I and Roger Stone had talked about, which is, Sheriff Clark will go in and just start chopping heads off.
[03:25:39.175 --> 03:25:41.737]  He's very smart, very articulate, very charismatic.
[03:25:42.137 --> 03:25:43.639]  You know what he calls the left now?
[03:25:43.819 --> 03:25:45.240]  Did you see his most recent speech?
[03:25:46.141 --> 03:25:46.882]  Can I say it on air?
[03:25:46.902 --> 03:25:47.082]  Sure.
[03:25:47.542 --> 03:25:48.483]  The Rat Bastards.
[03:25:49.383 --> 03:25:50.104]  That's what he calls them.
[03:25:50.645 --> 03:25:51.446]  Rat bastards.
[03:25:51.566 --> 03:25:53.368]  And he didn't just say it, like, in passing.
[03:25:53.408 --> 03:25:56.933]  He went on for five minutes talking about how these people are rat bastards.
[03:25:56.953 --> 03:25:58.015]  You don't think he's going to get in and do that?
[03:25:58.035 --> 03:25:59.537]  No, they want to destroy prosperity.
[03:25:59.757 --> 03:26:00.718]  They hate truthfulness.
[03:26:01.019 --> 03:26:02.000]  Like, I love Trump outgoing.
[03:26:02.040 --> 03:26:04.003]  Of course I fired him over this made-up Russian crap.
[03:26:04.463 --> 03:26:06.325]  They're like, oh my god, you just admitted obstruction of justice.
[03:26:06.645 --> 03:26:07.967]  No, it's made up crap!
[03:26:08.087 --> 03:26:09.569]  But again, that's how smart he is.
[03:26:09.929 --> 03:26:13.933]  He fires Comey, who the Democrats said was incompetent and untrustworthy.
[03:26:14.214 --> 03:26:18.378]  That would, you would say, okay, well then having that FBI director would be an obstruction of justice.
[03:26:18.558 --> 03:26:20.901]  He's incompetent, he's untrustworthy, I'm gonna fire him.
[03:26:21.201 --> 03:26:22.562]  You're obstructing justice!
[03:26:22.602 --> 03:26:26.124]  You fired the untrustworthy, incompetent FBI director we wanted fired!
[03:26:26.424 --> 03:26:27.225]  What the hell?
[03:26:27.325 --> 03:26:29.606]  In the next month or so, Sermons will have his own three-hour show.
[03:26:29.626 --> 03:26:31.908]  He won't just be interrupted by us here for an hour, but it's an interesting talk.
[03:26:32.348 --> 03:26:33.669]  What do you make of Rupert Murdoch?
[03:26:33.689 --> 03:26:37.491]  We have this directly from the White House, calling Trump and saying, look, I've decided to join with you.
[03:26:37.511 --> 03:26:40.093]  I've been flip-flopping, but they are planning to destroy you.
[03:26:40.113 --> 03:26:41.834]  And I guess he's been told he'll be destroyed now.
[03:26:41.854 --> 03:26:45.236]  They're not going to just let him kind of halfway sell out, because we know they've got dirt on Murdoch.
[03:26:45.876 --> 03:26:49.238]  You need to fire your whole upper echelon and, like you said, bring in good people.
[03:26:49.898 --> 03:26:51.099]  What does that intel mean to you?
[03:26:51.119 --> 03:26:52.299]  Did you have any information on that?
[03:26:53.220 --> 03:27:01.324]  Well, so what had happened with Fox is the Rupert Murdoch sons are just betas and they're completely owned by their wives who are more liberal.
[03:27:01.784 --> 03:27:03.945]  And so Fox is going to be a liberal network.
[03:27:04.525 --> 03:27:05.265]  And we all know that.
[03:27:05.285 --> 03:27:06.146]  So Fox is done.
[03:27:06.526 --> 03:27:07.947]  My perspective on that is
[03:27:08.707 --> 03:27:12.830]  That Trump needs to be watching InfoWars live streams in the White House.
[03:27:13.190 --> 03:27:16.632]  Trump needs to be live streaming this stuff on YouTube, our periscopes.
[03:27:16.952 --> 03:27:19.073]  He doesn't need to be watching Fox News anymore.
[03:27:19.373 --> 03:27:20.614]  Those people are out of touch.
[03:27:20.894 --> 03:27:21.895]  They don't get votes.
[03:27:22.235 --> 03:27:23.296]  They don't bring people.
[03:27:23.336 --> 03:27:24.076]  Well, exactly.
[03:27:24.156 --> 03:27:27.638]  Fox viewers were down 30-something percent in the election.
[03:27:27.818 --> 03:27:28.919]  They're down another 30 now.
[03:27:29.279 --> 03:27:34.362]  In fact, MSNBC and CNN are now beating Fox for the first time in 20 years!
[03:27:34.942 --> 03:27:35.162]  What?
[03:27:35.343 --> 03:27:36.223]  I mean, look at that!
[03:27:36.523 --> 03:27:37.264]  It's crazy!
[03:27:38.168 --> 03:27:39.269]  Well, they're out of touch.
[03:27:39.849 --> 03:27:40.749]  They're not patriots.
[03:27:40.809 --> 03:27:45.751]  And people realize that they're just going to become a liberal-like network.
[03:27:46.192 --> 03:27:47.912]  And that's just the way it's going to be, whatever.
[03:27:48.273 --> 03:27:55.496]  The point is, though, this is a good opportunity for Infowars and for Cernovich and Roger Stone and everybody else.
[03:27:56.156 --> 03:28:06.144]  The independent people to keep rising up because people tell me now, they go, I used to watch Fox News, but now I just watch you on the Alex Jones Show because that's so much more informative than what I'm getting.
[03:28:06.164 --> 03:28:09.427]  I don't want to brag, but I mean, I walk around the street now and people are listening all around.
[03:28:09.447 --> 03:28:10.488]  I mean, it's gotten crazy.
[03:28:10.668 --> 03:28:11.869]  I don't know how we have this in the audience.
[03:28:12.229 --> 03:28:13.750]  All right, sir, I'm going to turn this over to you.
[03:28:13.770 --> 03:28:14.731]  Thank you so much, my friend.
[03:28:15.331 --> 03:28:19.235]  Briefly, we've launched Emmerich's Essentials.
[03:28:20.424 --> 03:28:20.744]  That's
[03:28:37.381 --> 03:28:38.963]  I was about to say, this is a big national brand.
[03:28:39.023 --> 03:28:40.545]  It's 20% off what it is in Whole Foods.
[03:28:40.565 --> 03:28:44.590]  25% off on top of that when you sign up for AutoShip as an introductory offer.
[03:28:44.610 --> 03:28:45.892]  Our regular AutoShip is 10% off.
[03:28:46.493 --> 03:28:48.115]  It's all available at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:28:48.135 --> 03:28:49.757]  We have a bunch of group packs.
[03:28:50.538 --> 03:28:55.104]  It is the Super Natural Sunscreen that is the regular size, organic-based.
[03:28:55.584 --> 03:28:57.125]  It's not organic, it's not a life form.
[03:28:57.465 --> 03:29:06.767]  It's natural base of zinc, not the nano zinc, for the sunscreen, the 10 to 1 mouthwash, the natural body wash, the shampoo, the natural bug spray.
[03:29:07.107 --> 03:29:13.649]  It works BLA, Infowarsstore.com, AAA253, 3139, and the Medial Demonize.
[03:29:13.689 --> 03:29:17.671]  He sells shampoo and mouthwash, and he sells toothbrushes.
[03:29:17.711 --> 03:29:18.151]  Sorry, Mike.
[03:29:18.651 --> 03:29:18.871]  Go ahead.
[03:29:19.051 --> 03:29:27.357]  No, no, I was going to say, um, your children should be given these products because it's been proven that girls now are reaching puberty much younger than before.
[03:29:27.897 --> 03:29:30.078]  And young boys are actually having gyno.
[03:29:30.098 --> 03:29:36.563]  They're having, I'm not going to say what it's called, but it's B-I-T-C-H test now because of the hormonal disruption that has caused.
[03:29:36.583 --> 03:29:36.903]  That's right.
[03:29:36.943 --> 03:29:39.945]  That's why we've got organic systems with a plastic that doesn't have it all over.
[03:29:39.965 --> 03:29:40.525]  Oh, bug spray?
[03:29:40.706 --> 03:29:42.947]  Man, that bug spray they put out is so toxic, Alex.
[03:29:42.967 --> 03:29:43.427]  That's huge.
[03:29:43.768 --> 03:29:46.730]  It's Emrix Essentials, my middle name, and it helps fund the InfoWar.
[03:29:46.750 --> 03:29:47.770]  Thank you all for your support.
[03:29:48.050 --> 03:29:48.891]  Mike Cernovich, coming up.
[03:29:49.371 --> 03:29:52.373]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.294 --> 03:29:56.096]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.220 --> 03:30:03.461]  Imagine the world without InfoWars.
[03:30:03.761 --> 03:30:06.443]  The globalists have already consolidated their power.
[03:30:09.335 --> 03:30:13.038]  They don't want people to have their own economies, their own choices.
[03:30:13.738 --> 03:30:27.067]  When you spread the links to Infowars.com news stories and our videos, when you tell friends, family, and neighbors about our free iPhone and Droid apps, or send them a link to our daily podcast, you are involved in a revolutionary act against tyranny.
[03:30:27.487 --> 03:30:32.691]  It was George Orwell that said, in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[03:30:33.411 --> 03:30:37.254]  That's why I spend a lot of time trying to not just innovate,
[03:30:38.534 --> 03:30:44.636]  News and analysis and our fight against the globalists, but also thinking about how we're able to fund our operation.
[03:30:44.896 --> 03:30:47.717]  That's so critical to prosecute an information war.
[03:30:48.637 --> 03:31:03.602]  And I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic and high quality.
[03:31:04.002 --> 03:31:06.123]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we have private labeled it.
[03:31:07.043 --> 03:31:07.744]  I think so.
[03:31:23.698 --> 03:31:29.283]  You get an additional, out of the gates, 25% off on this product.
[03:31:29.864 --> 03:31:32.486]  Emmerich's Essentials is all about personal care.
[03:31:32.926 --> 03:31:33.547]  Hygiene.
[03:31:33.827 --> 03:31:35.068]  Not getting skin cancer.
[03:31:35.529 --> 03:31:39.192]  Not getting bit by a bunch of bugs and gnats and mosquitoes.
[03:31:39.692 --> 03:31:40.673]  It's all there.
[03:31:40.833 --> 03:31:41.614]  The body wash.
[03:31:41.734 --> 03:31:42.475]  The shampoo.
[03:31:43.035 --> 03:31:43.656]  The deodorant.
[03:31:44.116 --> 03:31:44.897]  The mouthwash.
[03:31:45.357 --> 03:31:45.698]  All of it!
[03:31:46.318 --> 03:31:47.439]  It's truly game-changing.
[03:31:47.920 --> 03:31:48.720]  BOA spray.
[03:31:49.040 --> 03:31:51.062]  Totally organic, essential oils.
[03:31:51.783 --> 03:31:55.326]  Works a lot better than the toxic chemical systems that are out there.
[03:31:55.706 --> 03:31:57.968]  And it is comparable in price.
[03:31:58.268 --> 03:31:59.710]  And again, it's concentrated.
[03:32:00.050 --> 03:32:01.471]  The deodorant is amazing.
[03:32:01.932 --> 03:32:02.612]  High quality.
[03:32:03.293 --> 03:32:04.854]  Doesn't have the aluminum garbage in it.
[03:32:05.134 --> 03:32:05.855]  Totally natural.
[03:32:06.155 --> 03:32:06.596]  Works great.
[03:32:07.537 --> 03:32:11.322]  SPF 30, face and body lotion, sunscreen, unscented.
[03:32:11.863 --> 03:32:16.611]  This is exciting because so many of the so-called sunscreens that are out there are toxic.
[03:32:16.771 --> 03:32:19.074]  Because everyone knows I'm obsessed with Wynn Wynns.
[03:32:19.094 --> 03:32:19.735]  20% off what it is retail.
[03:32:22.363 --> 03:32:28.646]  Because we cut out the middleman, and then additionally, if you sign up for auto-ship, out of the gates, 25% off that.
[03:32:29.106 --> 03:32:43.472]  Because I want you to try these products, I want you to love these products, I want to have a deeper relationship with you in a 360 win, a non-zero-sum game, where you get high quality, you get value, and you repeat order something you need every month.
[03:32:44.372 --> 03:32:51.999]  And then we're able to secure our funding into the future to not just stay at the level we're at, but to grow in the face of enemy attacks.
[03:32:52.279 --> 03:32:56.904]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, and you'll find Emmerich's Essentials.
[03:33:08.078 --> 03:33:14.726]  Coming to you live from Southern California, one of the top investigative journalists in the world, Mike Cernovich.
[03:33:14.746 --> 03:33:18.992]  Raging patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[03:33:19.412 --> 03:33:22.416]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:22.456 --> 03:33:25.700]  Yeah, and Mike Cernovich is taking over, but I just can't ever get away from a live microphone.
[03:33:25.720 --> 03:33:27.062]  I had them pull this clip an hour ago.
[03:33:27.142 --> 03:33:27.582]  Never played it.
[03:33:28.042 --> 03:33:34.825]  Here is Putin making jokes about all this craziness earlier today in a press conference and then Mike Cernovich will comment on that.
[03:33:34.845 --> 03:33:41.108]  We're gonna skip the break coming up later so Mike has more time but here is this clip so Mike can respond.
[03:33:42.748 --> 03:33:46.150]  He says neither me nor the representatives of Russian intelligence services.
[03:33:46.250 --> 03:33:48.771]  It was very bad of him because Trump didn't give us any info.
[03:33:48.791 --> 03:33:54.894]  Moreover, the United States administration finds it's possible we're ready to provide a record of the Trump-Lavrov talks.
[03:34:11.343 --> 03:34:11.783]  To the U.S.
[03:34:11.823 --> 03:34:13.024]  Congress and Senate, of course.
[03:34:13.644 --> 03:34:14.084]  It is the U.S.
[03:34:14.104 --> 03:34:15.124]  Administration wants it.
[03:34:15.504 --> 03:34:23.027]  But at the same time, we see that political schizophrenia is developing in the United States.
[03:34:23.567 --> 03:34:25.208]  It is mental illness.
[03:34:25.548 --> 03:34:32.310]  And I cannot find any other explanation for the accusation that Donald Trump had revealed some secret to Lavrov.
[03:34:32.670 --> 03:34:33.730]  Unlike some random meeting.
[03:34:40.040 --> 03:34:44.762]  At first, we looked at how the internet political process, internal system of the US is developing.
[03:34:45.062 --> 03:34:48.023]  We found it funny, but today it's not just sad, it worries us.
[03:34:48.944 --> 03:34:49.844]  Yeah.
[03:34:50.725 --> 03:34:54.527]  All of that has been done on the basis of incitement of anti-Russian sentiment.
[03:34:55.927 --> 03:35:01.170]  What surprises me is they are shaking up the domestic political situation in the United States using anti-Russian slogans.
[03:35:04.759 --> 03:35:12.962]  Either they don't understand the damage they're doing to their country, in which case they are simply stupid, or understanding everything, in this case, they are dangerous and corrupt people.
[03:35:15.763 --> 03:35:16.763]  Wow.
[03:35:17.523 --> 03:35:18.964]  That's all true, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:35:19.704 --> 03:35:27.487]  And they just intend to move forward, have an authoritarian takeover, in the claim that we're all Russian agents when the globalists are the ones destroying America?
[03:35:27.747 --> 03:35:28.968]  They have inverted reality.
[03:35:29.108 --> 03:35:29.948]  I don't see it working.
[03:35:29.968 --> 03:35:30.968]  Sorry, let's go ahead and take over.
[03:35:31.029 --> 03:35:32.029]  I'm sorry I'm still here.
[03:35:32.762 --> 03:35:37.003]  No, I mean, I'm glad, you know, to riff off each other because Putin nailed it.
[03:35:37.483 --> 03:35:39.384]  Trump didn't give the details to Putin.
[03:35:39.404 --> 03:35:40.925]  That's how we know it was McMaster.
[03:35:40.945 --> 03:35:42.445]  She's basic deductive reasoning.
[03:35:42.845 --> 03:35:43.585]  Who was in the room?
[03:35:44.085 --> 03:35:48.667]  Trump was, the Russians were, Dino Powell, Rex Tillerson, and McMaster.
[03:35:49.247 --> 03:35:51.049]  Tillerson didn't know any of this stuff.
[03:35:51.449 --> 03:35:53.691]  Dino Powell didn't have enough details to do it.
[03:35:54.091 --> 03:35:58.535]  It couldn't have been anybody who transcribed the meeting because Trump didn't have the details.
[03:35:59.095 --> 03:36:00.676]  McMaster is the leak.
[03:36:00.977 --> 03:36:06.922]  He leaked it to the Washington Post, as Putin confirming it, essentially, confirming that, hey, it wasn't us.
[03:36:07.462 --> 03:36:08.623]  It was probably McMaster.
[03:36:08.663 --> 03:36:11.185]  But Putin says it's gone from funny to really been concerning.
[03:36:11.265 --> 03:36:12.046]  It is concerning.
[03:36:13.240 --> 03:36:17.621]  Yeah, there's a big investigation now, which hasn't really been made public yet.
[03:36:18.062 --> 03:36:19.722]  There's a massive investigation.
[03:36:20.122 --> 03:36:23.843]  It is being treated as a major, major security threat.
[03:36:24.224 --> 03:36:27.145]  The Washington Post people are likely going to be subpoenaed.
[03:36:27.545 --> 03:36:33.507]  There's going to be a whole big court case over this because, again, Trump didn't have the details.
[03:36:33.967 --> 03:36:37.368]  That means whoever leaked it to the Washington Post... Exactly, and I was about to ask.
[03:36:38.735 --> 03:36:40.116]  How does Trump counter-strike?
[03:36:40.136 --> 03:36:42.539]  Because they've committed so many crimes, they're ignoring all these leaks.
[03:36:42.959 --> 03:36:44.120]  How does he get on the offense?
[03:36:44.160 --> 03:36:45.341]  How does he change the subject?
[03:36:46.422 --> 03:36:50.446]  The way he changes the subject is, go pro-president.
[03:36:50.666 --> 03:36:54.710]  I want to see live streams of him going to Israel and him going to Saudi Arabia.
[03:36:54.730 --> 03:36:55.671]  Sure, he's our real president.
[03:36:55.711 --> 03:37:00.616]  What about the idea that Drudge has of having a big military parade for veterans or something?
[03:37:01.567 --> 03:37:02.367]  Yeah, you could do that.
[03:37:02.387 --> 03:37:04.408]  You just have to change the news cycle.
[03:37:04.848 --> 03:37:09.390]  But what they do is they respond to the news that is made by the fake news media.
[03:37:09.410 --> 03:37:10.630]  They don't create news.
[03:37:11.010 --> 03:37:12.070]  They don't drive the news.
[03:37:12.131 --> 03:37:15.752]  Let me ask you this then, because I've studied a lot of political offices.
[03:37:15.772 --> 03:37:17.192]  The Republicans used to do bad stuff too.
[03:37:17.232 --> 03:37:18.833]  Democrats have always been worse on average.
[03:37:19.893 --> 03:37:26.041]  Trump is so pure and so not manipulative, he even admits, yeah, I got rid of the FBI because it's a made-up Russia thing.
[03:37:26.401 --> 03:37:27.502]  He didn't even lie about that.
[03:37:28.143 --> 03:37:33.409]  So comparing what he's trying to do to the establishment, they call that naive and stupid.
[03:37:33.990 --> 03:37:36.233]  They think straight shooting is dirty and bad.
[03:37:37.935 --> 03:37:41.037]  Yeah, but again, it all comes down to this, Alex.
[03:37:41.477 --> 03:37:44.820]  The world is nothing but a recurring news cycle.
[03:37:45.140 --> 03:37:50.003]  You're either making news, you're either breaking news, or you're caught in somebody else's news cycle.
[03:37:50.303 --> 03:37:52.865]  You and I, right now, we can have a conversation.
[03:37:53.145 --> 03:37:57.308]  For example, we kind of made a joke about Obama, you know, an absentee father.
[03:37:57.628 --> 03:37:58.629]  That became news.
[03:37:58.829 --> 03:38:02.511]  That was covered in every national paper in the world, essentially.
[03:38:02.992 --> 03:38:04.273]  We can drive news cycles.
[03:38:04.473 --> 03:38:05.533]  Oh, I'm glad you raised this.
[03:38:05.714 --> 03:38:07.495]  I said on tape, live,
[03:38:08.241 --> 03:38:08.545]  Then why?
[03:38:09.948 --> 03:38:18.491]  12 noon, that first little sports segment with Roger Stone, right here yesterday, I said, oh yeah, look at those lips on McMaster, because he was smiling whenever clearly he was the leaker.
[03:38:18.911 --> 03:38:26.453]  I said, he looks like he can suck a golf ball through a garden hose, because he was asking Stone once, why do all these national intelligence guys have bald heads?
[03:38:26.973 --> 03:38:32.375]  And I said, nothing against bald heads, nothing against gay people, maybe he's a leather daddy.
[03:38:32.435 --> 03:38:36.897]  I saw some South Park episode about bald headed guys in leather outfits, somebody with
[03:38:38.517 --> 03:38:39.738]  YMCA song or something.
[03:38:39.758 --> 03:38:44.662]  The point is, I made a joke knowing they'd pick it up everywhere so I could respond today.
[03:38:44.682 --> 03:38:46.003]  I kind of forgotten about what I did.
[03:38:46.884 --> 03:38:47.384]  Say, wait a minute.
[03:38:47.704 --> 03:38:54.850]  Keith Overman can claim that his holster, that Trump is the holster for his genitalia,
[03:38:55.350 --> 03:38:59.614]  That's okay for Keith Oberman, but when I do it, I'm this horrible anti-gay person.
[03:38:59.694 --> 03:38:59.935]  No!
[03:39:00.435 --> 03:39:01.857]  It was a joke!
[03:39:02.217 --> 03:39:04.719]  I don't believe McMaster's gay, so what if he is?
[03:39:05.060 --> 03:39:06.681]  We were saying, why does he have a bald head?
[03:39:06.721 --> 03:39:07.783]  Look at those big lips!
[03:39:08.263 --> 03:39:09.264]  It was a joke!
[03:39:09.704 --> 03:39:12.287]  Everybody else can make jokes, why can't I?
[03:39:12.667 --> 03:39:14.709]  Again, they don't get the game they're playing.
[03:39:15.330 --> 03:39:19.233]  And now that's all over the news, that I think McMaster's gay, and I hate gay people.
[03:39:19.474 --> 03:39:20.474]  I never said any of that!
[03:39:20.815 --> 03:39:26.099]  I knew I would troll them, because Stephen Colbert said something even more about Trump.
[03:39:26.540 --> 03:39:30.523]  Saturday Night Live, every episode, says that Trump wants to have sex with Spicer!
[03:39:31.063 --> 03:39:32.585]  He's crawling on top of him!
[03:39:33.005 --> 03:39:33.846]  It's not true!
[03:39:34.126 --> 03:39:36.008]  Why is it okay for them, but not for me?
[03:39:37.315 --> 03:39:39.097]  No, those are just the rules of engagement.
[03:39:39.137 --> 03:39:40.639]  We're not allowed to do satire.
[03:39:40.959 --> 03:39:51.632]  But the bigger point you touched on, which is so important, is that if you and I want to, we can say, hey, Alex, we want to get the media talking and we can create a news cycle.
[03:39:52.112 --> 03:39:54.816]  That means the media has to respond to what we say.
[03:39:55.629 --> 03:40:02.471]  Well, Trump's current communications department policy is, oh, the media's asking us questions, we better answer their questions.
[03:40:03.271 --> 03:40:03.951]  That's the key.
[03:40:04.031 --> 03:40:04.771]  That's his problem.
[03:40:04.851 --> 03:40:06.632]  Why does he not control the news anymore?
[03:40:06.952 --> 03:40:12.213]  Why do his people, why are they kept slaves of those little, shriveled, peckered New World Order people?
[03:40:13.214 --> 03:40:13.774]  Exactly.
[03:40:14.114 --> 03:40:16.174]  It's attack, attack, attack, never defend.
[03:40:16.474 --> 03:40:17.335]  I mean, think about it.
[03:40:17.415 --> 03:40:18.515]  Other than, say, Trump.
[03:40:19.150 --> 03:40:21.731]  Who is attacked more in the media than people like you and I?
[03:40:22.412 --> 03:40:26.654]  The things they call me pro-rape, they call me a rape advocate for crying out loud.
[03:40:27.014 --> 03:40:29.415]  Any heinous thing that you can think of, they've called me.
[03:40:29.675 --> 03:40:31.997]  Even though you're against Islam, that is the culture of rape.
[03:40:32.657 --> 03:40:34.118]  Yeah, and I never defend myself.
[03:40:34.578 --> 03:40:37.199]  I never answer, what I do is I attack them.
[03:40:37.339 --> 03:40:38.880]  I say, why didn't you investigate my profession?
[03:40:38.900 --> 03:40:40.661]  I agree, because their attacks mean nothing.
[03:40:40.701 --> 03:40:42.782]  People say, how are you handling all these lies?
[03:40:42.862 --> 03:40:44.163]  Great, audience has never been bigger.
[03:40:44.783 --> 03:40:46.184]  Because here's the secret, Sarnavaj.
[03:40:47.267 --> 03:40:54.952]  The attack's not on us, it's on our audience hoping they're weak minded and think, like I had people walk up to me on the street and go, how's it going losing your wife?
[03:40:55.533 --> 03:40:59.896]  And I go, well, it was three years ago and I've got my children and I've had another baby and it's actually quite wonderful.
[03:41:00.176 --> 03:41:02.458]  I didn't want a divorce, but man, I really love my new wife.
[03:41:02.518 --> 03:41:02.918]  It's great.
[03:41:03.218 --> 03:41:05.700]  And like the blood drains out of their face.
[03:41:06.020 --> 03:41:07.641]  And I'm like, that's right, dumbass.
[03:41:07.922 --> 03:41:09.603]  They put this out to sound like I'm a loser.
[03:41:09.863 --> 03:41:14.046]  I've never been a bigger winner, but it's all a simulation for them to feel powerful.
[03:41:15.270 --> 03:41:16.491]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[03:41:16.531 --> 03:41:25.576]  But the more fun is, again, how much our own people who are listening, they're independent thinkers, and they don't believe any of that crap.
[03:41:25.696 --> 03:41:34.501]  What's funny, actually, that I find amusing is my own people, you know, who are great people, they take the attacks on me more personally than I do.
[03:41:34.581 --> 03:41:35.502]  I just laugh them off.
[03:41:36.042 --> 03:41:44.630]  They know that we're being attacked and that's what's so beautiful about everybody listening and watching and everything is they understand that in this war everybody is a soldier.
[03:41:44.670 --> 03:41:45.130]  Exactly.
[03:41:45.150 --> 03:41:45.791]  I want to be clear.
[03:41:46.211 --> 03:41:47.832]  I ignore it, let it roll off my back.
[03:41:48.553 --> 03:41:49.594]  You know, it hurts.
[03:41:49.614 --> 03:41:50.014]  Some of it hurts.
[03:41:50.034 --> 03:41:50.715]  Some of it gets through.
[03:41:51.355 --> 03:41:52.697]  At least intellectually I'll laugh at it.
[03:41:52.937 --> 03:41:54.718]  But having people defend us means so much.
[03:41:55.359 --> 03:41:58.061]  It really is awesome because we are extensions of our audience.
[03:41:58.081 --> 03:41:58.502]  They have to know.
[03:41:58.762 --> 03:41:59.542]  They listened to us.
[03:41:59.602 --> 03:42:00.283]  They supported us.
[03:42:00.583 --> 03:42:01.384]  They made us.
[03:42:01.704 --> 03:42:03.065]  We're like your robotic
[03:42:04.042 --> 03:42:06.385]  Probes that you've sent out to fight the globalists.
[03:42:06.445 --> 03:42:07.186]  We are you.
[03:42:07.266 --> 03:42:08.287]  You are the info war.
[03:42:08.508 --> 03:42:09.269]  That's not rhetoric.
[03:42:09.349 --> 03:42:10.210]  You are us.
[03:42:10.470 --> 03:42:11.171]  We are you.
[03:42:11.491 --> 03:42:12.432]  You have supported us.
[03:42:12.472 --> 03:42:13.454]  You have spread the word.
[03:42:13.694 --> 03:42:14.775]  You have interfaced with us.
[03:42:14.996 --> 03:42:16.057]  We have communed together.
[03:42:16.157 --> 03:42:17.038]  We are one.
[03:42:17.118 --> 03:42:17.919]  It really is true.
[03:42:18.200 --> 03:42:19.822]  That is the most important thing folks need to know.
[03:42:20.802 --> 03:42:23.644]  Yeah, the way I always tell it is, we're not on a pedestal.
[03:42:24.165 --> 03:42:25.806]  We're just down there with the troops.
[03:42:25.846 --> 03:42:26.766]  I mean, think about this.
[03:42:27.347 --> 03:42:31.050]  You went with the protesters, RNC, the megaphone.
[03:42:31.430 --> 03:42:33.371]  I went with the protesters at the DNC.
[03:42:33.692 --> 03:42:39.996]  People like Jack Posobiec are going in and covering the violent Farrell Antifa, Owen, Millie.
[03:42:40.056 --> 03:42:42.118]  We're all in the mix, man, every day.
[03:42:43.908 --> 03:42:45.368]  I want to give you some time for your own rants.
[03:42:45.549 --> 03:42:46.929]  We're going to skip this break so you have more time.
[03:42:46.949 --> 03:42:52.571]  Then I have a video we're going to play right at the end of the hour dealing with some of the new things we've launched to support the broadcast.
[03:42:53.311 --> 03:42:54.311]  And then we're going to end this for the day.
[03:42:54.331 --> 03:42:55.512]  But I look forward to the next month or so.
[03:42:55.532 --> 03:42:58.492]  We're getting it all set up to launch a two, three hour show for you every day.
[03:42:58.512 --> 03:42:59.833]  But you go ahead and take over.
[03:43:00.771 --> 03:43:03.495]  Have you watched that video yet of the Turkish diplomatic people?
[03:43:03.575 --> 03:43:04.496]  Oh, I meant to get to that.
[03:43:04.516 --> 03:43:05.638]  That was my top video.
[03:43:05.878 --> 03:43:08.321]  Yeah, let's talk about that, guys, because there's a bunch of bad ones.
[03:43:08.541 --> 03:43:09.983]  There's one that's HD up close.
[03:43:10.324 --> 03:43:13.929]  Do we have the Turkish residents of the Turkish ambassador?
[03:43:14.710 --> 03:43:15.631]  Yeah, here it is.
[03:43:15.711 --> 03:43:23.936]  What does this mean to show the Turks are so anti-freedom that they would attack another group demonstrating peacefully and beat everyone up?
[03:43:24.376 --> 03:43:26.137]  I mean, this is just crazy.
[03:43:27.718 --> 03:43:31.961]  And the Turks are telling Germany and Europe, you'll do what we say, and they're threatening everybody.
[03:43:32.041 --> 03:43:33.122]  What is going on with Turkey?
[03:43:34.346 --> 03:43:42.191]  And moreover, these are the people we're supposed to fight World War III with Russia over, because they're in NATO, in the no-fly zone.
[03:43:42.592 --> 03:43:45.534]  This is the people that Americans are supposed to die for.
[03:43:45.934 --> 03:43:53.119]  They come to our country, where we don't believe in free speech, and like a bunch of thugs, smash our own citizens.
[03:43:53.459 --> 03:44:01.884]  This should be over all the news everywhere, but Deep State, they like Turkey, because they're using Turkey as a pawn to make a World War III with Russia.
[03:44:02.345 --> 03:44:03.566]  Let's play this audio.
[03:44:04.506 --> 03:44:07.792]  You know, they just can't stand the fact that they can't kill all the Armenians here.
[03:44:07.832 --> 03:44:08.252]  They'd love to.
[03:44:08.272 --> 03:44:10.996]  They've almost killed every Christian in Turkey, but not here yet.
[03:44:11.698 --> 03:44:16.305]  That's not the political action of the Turks.
[03:44:16.685 --> 03:44:19.029]  This is what they mean when they call themselves the Young Turks.
[03:44:19.049 --> 03:44:19.770]  They are a terrorist organization.
[03:44:19.810 --> 03:44:37.674]  Oh yeah, it's a total joke that he named himself the Young Turks when that's the young political group of thugs that led the movement to first burn down shops, stores, kill people, rape people in Turkey at the beginning of World War I and two years later they killed a million, three million, five Christians who'd been in there for over 2,000 years.
[03:44:38.014 --> 03:44:43.175]  They murdered them and the Young Turks make jokes about this and won't even decry the Armenian massacre.
[03:44:43.235 --> 03:44:45.675]  What a group of monster pigs.
[03:44:45.996 --> 03:44:47.516]  Let's play the video for everybody right now.
[03:44:47.556 --> 03:44:47.896]  Here it is.
[03:44:51.734 --> 03:44:55.657]  Again, you've got the Turkish security people doing whatever they want.
[03:44:55.677 --> 03:44:57.038]  This is great footage, whoever shot this.
[03:44:59.399 --> 03:45:07.504]  Okay, so they go across the street.
[03:45:08.345 --> 03:45:15.690]  So we've now got them saying, go across the street, and then the Turkish security forces are pushing on the cops, ordering them around, telling them what to do, and then they just attack everybody.
[03:45:25.842 --> 03:45:35.996]  We're gonna start this footage over at the beginning with audio because this just shows how our country has been turned to this lawless sewer and I can't tell you in my own life I've had turkey
[03:45:37.623 --> 03:45:41.784]  The Turkish government, the Gulen movement, all of it, just in our business.
[03:45:42.364 --> 03:45:45.525]  And then you see Turkey saying, it's time for jihad in Europe.
[03:45:45.585 --> 03:45:47.285]  Let more of us in or we'll attack.
[03:45:47.325 --> 03:45:48.145]  We'll have holy war.
[03:45:48.626 --> 03:45:49.546]  Let's play this from the first.
[03:45:49.566 --> 03:45:49.906]  Here it is.
[03:45:49.966 --> 03:45:50.806]  It's intriguing footage.
[03:45:51.086 --> 03:45:51.946]  Should have led the show with it.
[03:45:51.966 --> 03:45:52.326]  Here it is.
[03:45:57.588 --> 03:46:03.229]  And so you got the security people of the Turkish ambassador's house just running out.
[03:46:05.211 --> 03:46:06.292]  Beating everybody up.
[03:46:07.212 --> 03:46:08.973]  These are protesters who are peaceful.
[03:46:09.374 --> 03:46:11.455]  These are peaceful American protesters.
[03:46:13.656 --> 03:46:17.739]  And if you're a radio listener, this is amazing, like HD footage.
[03:46:18.079 --> 03:46:19.000]  It's like 3D.
[03:46:19.020 --> 03:46:20.661]  What kind of camera shot this?
[03:46:27.032 --> 03:46:28.953]  And this is, uh, what is this, American... Sesi?
[03:46:30.533 --> 03:46:31.534]  I can't pronounce it.
[03:46:31.574 --> 03:46:33.995]  Voice of America, it looks like, but in, like, foreign language.
[03:46:34.815 --> 03:46:36.155]  Yeah, Voice of America.
[03:46:36.175 --> 03:46:37.656]  So Voice of America even got this.
[03:46:37.696 --> 03:46:38.316]  Good God.
[03:46:38.336 --> 03:46:41.117]  I mean, Turkey is just out of control.
[03:46:41.137 --> 03:46:43.418]  I love how the public's trained.
[03:46:43.458 --> 03:46:44.718]  Like, these guys, I'm not saying I'm a tough guy.
[03:46:44.738 --> 03:46:45.799]  I'm trying to start trying to punch me.
[03:46:45.819 --> 03:46:47.519]  They're not even good fighters.
[03:46:47.539 --> 03:46:49.060]  They just beat the hell out of these people.
[03:46:49.980 --> 03:46:50.420]  Uh, wow.
[03:46:50.661 --> 03:46:51.861]  Uh, I know we have some of the details.
[03:46:51.921 --> 03:46:52.741]  Mike, what happened here?
[03:46:52.781 --> 03:46:53.902]  Who was out there protesting?
[03:46:53.922 --> 03:46:54.362]  What happened?
[03:46:55.342 --> 03:47:01.231]  So they were Armenians and Yemenis who were protesting the dictatorship in Turkey.
[03:47:01.512 --> 03:47:04.716]  If this is happening in America... And I guess, again, in America and D.C.
[03:47:04.736 --> 03:47:06.399]  and the Turks are mad they couldn't kill all of them.
[03:47:06.419 --> 03:47:08.302]  Like, oh my God, we couldn't kill your grandmother.
[03:47:08.362 --> 03:47:09.223]  Here, let me attack you now.
[03:47:10.259 --> 03:47:23.809]  Right, just like the Young Turks have inspired multiple mass shooters like Elliot Roger, like the Seattle shooter, the Young Turks have actually inspired more mass shooters in America than anybody else and certainly the media will not cover it up.
[03:47:24.029 --> 03:47:25.991]  So this should be the number one story in the world.
[03:47:26.491 --> 03:47:35.158]  If the Turkish people will come and beat up Yemenis and Armenians in America, in our nation's capital, imagine what is happening in Turkey.
[03:47:36.298 --> 03:47:36.919]  Get across the street.
[03:47:37.930 --> 03:47:38.850]  That's what I thought it was.
[03:47:38.890 --> 03:47:40.631]  So it's Turks attacking Armenians.
[03:47:41.011 --> 03:47:43.673]  Because I guess they're like, oh my god, a 4,000 escaped to America.
[03:47:43.733 --> 03:47:44.433]  Here's their grandkids.
[03:47:44.473 --> 03:47:45.013]  Let's attack them.
[03:47:45.033 --> 03:47:46.894]  So they're just so pissed they're still alive.
[03:47:47.895 --> 03:47:48.895]  Yeah, the genocide.
[03:47:49.315 --> 03:47:50.636]  Yeah, they were upset.
[03:47:50.676 --> 03:47:56.038]  People like Sinka and the young Turks, they're mad that they didn't murder and genocide and Holocaust every Armenian.
[03:47:56.058 --> 03:47:57.379]  And now they're coming after them.
[03:47:58.911 --> 03:48:01.652]  I mean, do you really think that Sinki actually thinks that?
[03:48:02.392 --> 03:48:02.852]  Oh, for sure.
[03:48:02.892 --> 03:48:03.512]  He named his show.
[03:48:03.532 --> 03:48:07.473]  That would be like if I started a radio show called the SS, right?
[03:48:08.053 --> 03:48:08.653]  Who would do that?
[03:48:08.673 --> 03:48:11.914]  The Young Turks is literally the enforcer.
[03:48:11.934 --> 03:48:17.275]  Like, if you named it 88, Heil Hitler, we're the SS, and you wore black uniforms.
[03:48:18.115 --> 03:48:18.715]  Right, exactly.
[03:48:18.735 --> 03:48:21.055]  It would be like calling it the 1488 Show.
[03:48:21.175 --> 03:48:24.076]  You know, we should really investigate, how do you say, Sinker?
[03:48:25.206 --> 03:48:27.168]  Yeah, I always forget, yeah.
[03:48:27.188 --> 03:48:30.590]  Because, I mean, we really should investigate him and like, why?
[03:48:30.650 --> 03:48:32.011]  Because he did name it Young Turks.
[03:48:32.071 --> 03:48:34.293]  That's the group that started the genocide.
[03:48:34.353 --> 03:48:35.514]  Why would you name your group that?
[03:48:36.428 --> 03:48:44.613]  Well, and I'm going to give you actually, I'm going to send over to Nico right now a story about all of the mass shootings that the Young Turks fans have committed.
[03:48:44.953 --> 03:48:46.394]  So a lot of people don't know this.
[03:48:46.594 --> 03:48:50.556]  They're always trying to say you and I, you know, mean people and everybody watch us.
[03:48:50.857 --> 03:48:52.297]  But this is actually not true.
[03:48:52.317 --> 03:48:53.678]  So I'm going to say we should break this.
[03:48:53.778 --> 03:48:55.159]  You know, this is a big thing here.
[03:48:55.179 --> 03:48:56.860]  I'm sending it right over to Nico right now.
[03:48:57.460 --> 03:49:01.383]  But the Young Turks in Sinka have inspired terrorism and multiple shooters.
[03:49:02.103 --> 03:49:04.885]  Elliott Roger, who, you know, killed a bunch of people.
[03:49:05.581 --> 03:49:08.203]  In Chula Vista in California was a Young Turks fan.
[03:49:08.543 --> 03:49:15.667]  Arkan Seton, who was the Seattle Mall shooter, he was a big fan, a big, big fan of the Young Turks, a subscriber of the Young Turks.
[03:49:16.107 --> 03:49:17.988]  Really, really, really into the Young Turks.
[03:49:18.388 --> 03:49:26.733]  So I guess the question is, why is it that if somebody who follows us on Twitter, you know, farts in the wrong direction, that's going to be called a sarin gas attack?
[03:49:27.093 --> 03:49:30.836]  But the Young Turks are inspiring mass murderers and mass shooters
[03:49:31.596 --> 03:49:33.497]  And the media won't make them disavow this.
[03:49:33.577 --> 03:49:34.217]  Why will the media not?
[03:49:34.238 --> 03:49:36.559]  Well, it is true that the Young Turks were funded by Qatar.
[03:49:37.099 --> 03:49:40.961]  And when I mentioned that, whenever I saw them at the DNC or RNC, they blew up.
[03:49:42.222 --> 03:49:42.902]  Right, exactly.
[03:49:42.922 --> 03:49:52.848]  So that's my question is, why won't the media demand that the Young Turks disavow the terrorists who read them and the mass shooters who watch them?
[03:49:52.888 --> 03:49:54.128]  This should be the biggest story in the world.
[03:49:54.148 --> 03:49:54.589]  Let me ask you this.
[03:49:54.609 --> 03:49:56.830]  What do you think the Young Turks want in America?
[03:49:57.190 --> 03:49:58.631]  And why are they force-fed by Google?
[03:49:59.775 --> 03:50:01.155]  Well, that tells you everything, right?
[03:50:01.195 --> 03:50:02.396]  They want what Shabani wants.
[03:50:02.816 --> 03:50:08.337]  They want to run everybody out of business, and they want to caliphate, and they want us running under Sharia law.
[03:50:08.817 --> 03:50:14.618]  They want more, they want the Armenian genocide, which is, of course, why Sinka's show is called The Young Turks.
[03:50:14.998 --> 03:50:16.959]  He wants to support the Turkish dictator.
[03:50:17.519 --> 03:50:19.119]  He wants to enslave.
[03:50:19.679 --> 03:50:22.900]  He wants to enslave everybody in America.
[03:50:22.960 --> 03:50:23.780]  They want genocide.
[03:50:23.800 --> 03:50:25.020]  They want to kill the Armenians.
[03:50:25.060 --> 03:50:26.161]  They want to kill the Yemenis.
[03:50:26.541 --> 03:50:28.221]  They're genocidal maniacs.
[03:50:30.080 --> 03:50:34.342]  Well, all I know is I don't know the Turks or the Kurds or who all wants what.
[03:50:34.422 --> 03:50:40.024]  I just know that we just saw the Turkish government people beat up a bunch of Armenians and it's completely out of control.
[03:50:40.824 --> 03:50:43.425]  Mike Cernovich, thank you so much for co-hosting today.
[03:50:43.845 --> 03:50:50.408]  I've got several videos that we're going to play here at the end of the transmission dealing with some of the new sponsorship we've got.
[03:50:51.228 --> 03:50:52.749]  But thank you for the work you're doing.
[03:50:52.789 --> 03:50:54.950]  I look forward to you being back on the broadcast next week.
[03:50:55.610 --> 03:50:55.950]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:50:55.970 --> 03:50:56.810]  I'll see you next week.
[03:50:57.131 --> 03:50:57.471]  Thank you.
[03:50:58.870 --> 03:51:02.612]  Folks, we're going to be on the Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[03:51:02.652 --> 03:51:08.115]  I want to air the new promo here in a moment for the new product, Emrix Essentials, and we're going to end this transmission.
[03:51:09.036 --> 03:51:18.742]  But I just want to thank you all the listeners for your support, for your prayers, for spreading the word about the broadcast, because we are under unprecedented attack.
[03:51:20.442 --> 03:51:22.143]  We are being criticized on every front.
[03:51:22.183 --> 03:51:27.767]  We do have all these different forces that are trying to bring down our president.
[03:51:28.852 --> 03:51:31.194]  And it's time for the sleeping giant America to awaken.
[03:51:31.214 --> 03:51:38.281]  We've had it good so long that we don't even know the world we're living in anymore.
[03:51:38.901 --> 03:51:41.584]  So Mike Cernovich, you can follow him on Twitter at Cernovich.
[03:51:42.144 --> 03:51:44.006]  You can follow him at Danger and Play.
[03:51:44.026 --> 03:51:46.548]  You can find his book with us.
[03:51:47.769 --> 03:51:51.633]  You can spread our articles and videos because that's how we're changing the world.
[03:51:51.693 --> 03:51:54.735]  They wouldn't be targeting us if
[03:51:55.834 --> 03:51:57.776]  We weren't effective, just like Mike Cernovich said.
[03:51:58.117 --> 03:51:59.659]  Let me just ask Mike one more question.
[03:51:59.679 --> 03:52:01.401]  We've got about two minutes before I go to this promo piece.
[03:52:02.142 --> 03:52:06.327]  This little ad I put together with Rob Doo for the new shampoo and stuff, and we're going to end the show today.
[03:52:06.347 --> 03:52:08.790]  I'll be back tonight, 7 o'clock Central, Lord willing.
[03:52:09.410 --> 03:52:11.313]  What are some of the other big shoes to drop here?
[03:52:13.008 --> 03:52:20.414]  Right now, my number one priority is, I just got a text message from somebody actually, so let me see if I can get this out real quick.
[03:52:20.454 --> 03:52:28.621]  So they were actually watching us live, and he had told me that he just saw my tweet about the schedule C's temporary employees.
[03:52:28.641 --> 03:52:31.383]  He said, it's actually worse than what you said.
[03:52:31.763 --> 03:52:38.409]  People are being told they have a permanent position, but their paperwork is not being processed, it's being stalled.
[03:52:39.247 --> 03:52:44.152]  And then half of the original Trump supporters are actually being told they will not be reappointed.
[03:52:44.652 --> 03:52:52.180]  My estimation that only 15% of Trump people will be given permanent positions is probably too high.
[03:52:52.240 --> 03:52:54.061]  It will actually be fewer than that.
[03:52:54.102 --> 03:52:59.547]  So 90% of the pro-Trump people, May 20th to May 23rd, they're all gone, man.
[03:52:59.927 --> 03:53:00.668]  Thousands of people.
[03:53:02.881 --> 03:53:03.661]  Well, I know this.
[03:53:03.741 --> 03:53:07.943]  We're in a very historical time right now, Mike, and political action is the answer.
[03:53:08.524 --> 03:53:14.086]  I see the globalists and the leftists all going crazy like this right now because they know their time is short.
[03:53:14.547 --> 03:53:16.147]  They know humanity's waking up to them.
[03:53:16.167 --> 03:53:17.448]  I mean, I really think that's why this is happening.
[03:53:18.925 --> 03:53:20.066]  No, it's 100%.
[03:53:20.106 --> 03:53:20.547]  Why?
[03:53:20.947 --> 03:53:33.518]  They gotta get rid of the people who actually got Trump elected, squeeze out the Trump supporters, keep bringing in the never-Trumpers, keep leaking classified information that Trump didn't even have, so that you're jeopardizing national security.
[03:53:33.839 --> 03:53:35.640]  I think they want a terrorist attack, to be honest.
[03:53:35.700 --> 03:53:37.402]  I think they've lost their minds so much.
[03:53:37.822 --> 03:53:42.288]  That they want to frame Russia for a terrorist attack and hope that that will implement World War III.
[03:53:42.308 --> 03:53:42.928]  And that's right.
[03:53:43.029 --> 03:53:45.492]  And we've got to get back to what we were doing during the campaign.
[03:53:45.552 --> 03:53:50.037]  Trump, regardless, defending liberty, getting info out, realizing the fight just begun.
[03:53:50.057 --> 03:53:52.480]  Like I said on election night, we just want to battle.
[03:53:52.520 --> 03:53:53.802]  The war has just begun.
[03:53:54.483 --> 03:53:55.884]  Mike Cernovich, thank you so much.
[03:53:55.924 --> 03:53:56.905]  How else do folks follow you?
[03:53:57.759 --> 03:54:04.648]  Yeah, twitter.com forward slash C-E-R-N-O-V-I-C-H is the best place to find everything and we'll be breaking news.
[03:54:04.728 --> 03:54:09.514]  And as you can see, you know, we're really growing very, very fast on Twitter and the word is getting out.
[03:54:09.914 --> 03:54:14.940]  So even though, you know, Alex and I talk about the prices, that is only because we want you
[03:54:15.701 --> 03:54:17.142]  To know you gotta get in the game.
[03:54:17.162 --> 03:54:18.363]  You can't be on the sidelines anymore.
[03:54:18.383 --> 03:54:19.343]  That's right, you have the power.
[03:54:19.423 --> 03:54:20.584]  Alright, Mike, thank you so much.
[03:54:20.604 --> 03:54:27.647]  Alright, I'm gonna do this little promo for Emerson Essentials and the show's gonna be over, but thank you for staying and watching and supporting us, because we couldn't do it without you.
[03:54:28.128 --> 03:54:30.849]  And then tonight, 7 o'clock Central, a lot of breaking news and analysis.
[03:54:31.149 --> 03:54:33.630]  And then, Lord willing, I'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[03:54:33.670 --> 03:54:33.991]  Central.
[03:54:34.011 --> 03:54:36.352]  But the very start of the broadcast, I laid out
[03:54:37.338 --> 03:54:39.038]  They bring Trump down, it really hurts us.
[03:54:39.679 --> 03:54:41.899]  This is an epic battle, this is history happening.
[03:54:42.239 --> 03:54:45.200]  Colonel Schaefer and others agree, this is a global, deep state operation.
[03:54:45.600 --> 03:54:46.181]  This is big.
[03:54:46.801 --> 03:54:50.902]  So again, here is that breakdown of Emmerich's essentials, and please join me tomorrow.
[03:54:51.382 --> 03:54:53.523]  Lord willing, I'll be here, 11 a.m.
[03:54:53.583 --> 03:54:55.763]  Central, but Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock.
[03:54:55.803 --> 03:54:57.004]  That's it for this broadcast.
[03:54:57.464 --> 03:54:58.164]  Until the end.
[03:54:59.684 --> 03:55:01.845]  Imagine the world without InfoWars.
[03:55:03.623 --> 03:55:07.605]  The globalists have already consolidated their power.
[03:55:07.785 --> 03:55:11.466]  They don't want people to have their own economies, their own choices.
[03:55:12.187 --> 03:55:25.512]  When you spread the links to Infowars.com news stories and our videos, when you tell friends, family, and neighbors about our free iPhone and Droid apps, or send them a link to our daily podcast, you are involved in a revolutionary act against tyranny.
[03:55:25.893 --> 03:55:31.095]  It was George Orwell that said, in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[03:55:31.855 --> 03:55:43.092]  That's why I spend a lot of time trying to not just innovate news and analysis and our fight against the globalists, but also thinking about how we're able to fund our operation.
[03:55:43.372 --> 03:55:46.116]  That's so critical to prosecute an information war.
[03:55:47.077 --> 03:56:02.030]  And I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic and high quality.
[03:56:02.471 --> 03:56:04.572]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we have private labeled it.
[03:56:05.934 --> 03:56:18.265]  And it is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emrix Essentials, and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from InfoWareStore.com.
[03:56:19.105 --> 03:56:21.628]  On top of that, if you sign up for AutoShip,
[03:56:22.168 --> 03:56:27.731]  You get an additional, out of the gates, 25% off on this product.
[03:56:28.291 --> 03:56:30.933]  Emmerich's Essentials is all about personal care.
[03:56:31.373 --> 03:56:31.993]  Hygiene.
[03:56:32.273 --> 03:56:33.374]  Not getting skin cancer.
[03:56:33.974 --> 03:56:37.656]  Not getting bit by a bunch of bugs and gnats and mosquitoes.
[03:56:38.057 --> 03:56:39.037]  It's all there.
[03:56:39.217 --> 03:56:39.998]  The body wash.
[03:56:40.098 --> 03:56:40.858]  The shampoo.
[03:56:41.398 --> 03:56:42.019]  The deodorant.
[03:56:42.499 --> 03:56:43.239]  The mouthwash.
[03:56:43.740 --> 03:56:44.060]  All of it!
[03:56:44.620 --> 03:56:45.800]  That is truly game-changing.
[03:56:46.301 --> 03:56:47.101]  BOA spray.
[03:56:47.401 --> 03:56:49.441]  Totally organic, essential oils.
[03:56:50.162 --> 03:56:53.703]  Works a lot better than the toxic chemical systems that are out there.
[03:56:54.063 --> 03:56:56.343]  And it is comparable in price.
[03:56:56.663 --> 03:56:58.084]  And again, it's concentrated.
[03:56:58.424 --> 03:56:59.844]  The deodorant is amazing.
[03:57:00.305 --> 03:57:00.985]  High quality.
[03:57:01.665 --> 03:57:03.205]  Doesn't have the aluminum garbage in it.
[03:57:03.505 --> 03:57:04.226]  Totally natural.
[03:57:04.506 --> 03:57:04.966]  Works great.
[03:57:05.927 --> 03:57:09.692]  SPF 30, face and body lotion, sunscreen, unscented.
[03:57:10.253 --> 03:57:15.039]  This is exciting because so many of the so-called sunscreens that are out there are toxic.
[03:57:15.480 --> 03:57:18.524]  As everyone knows, I'm obsessed with Win-Wins.
[03:57:18.544 --> 03:57:21.768]  20% off what it is retailed because we cut out the middleman.
[03:57:22.580 --> 03:57:27.022]  And then additionally, if you sign up for AutoShip, out of the gates, 25% off that.
[03:57:27.503 --> 03:57:41.871]  Because I want you to try these products, I want you to love these products, I want to have a deeper relationship with you in a 360 win, a non-zero-sum game, where you get high quality, you get value, and you repeat order something you need every month.
[03:57:42.751 --> 03:57:50.378]  And then we're able to secure our funding into the future to not just stay at the level we're at, but to grow in the face of enemy attacks.
[03:57:50.658 --> 03:57:55.283]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, and you'll find Emmerich's Essentials.
[03:58:05.216 --> 03:58:16.305]  During the week of April 10, 2017, certain statements were made on the InfoWars Twitter feed and YouTube channel regarding Shabani LLC that I now understand to be wrong.
[03:58:17.025 --> 03:58:20.488]  The tweets and video have now been retracted and will not be reposted.
[03:58:20.928 --> 03:58:27.934]  On behalf of InfoWars, I regret that we mischaracterized Shabani, its employees, and the people of Twin Falls, Idaho, the way we did.
[03:58:34.386 --> 03:58:39.092]  Alright, folks, we're about to re-kick off the entire transmission today when I break down the whole Globals takeover plan.
[03:58:39.132 --> 03:58:39.713]  This is key.
[03:58:40.313 --> 03:58:41.595]  Tell your friends and family, tune in now.
[03:58:41.635 --> 03:58:43.217]  InfoWars.com, Voice of My Show.
[03:58:43.697 --> 03:58:44.158]  Stay with us.
[03:58:50.444 --> 03:59:07.335]  The Clinton body count resurfaces as a very brave private investigator reveals evidence that DNC staffer Seth Rich indeed had contact with WikiLeaks just days before his unsolved murder.
[03:59:07.595 --> 03:59:15.421]  Seth Rich joins a long list of unfortunate murder and suicide victims with close ties to the Clintons.
[03:59:15.741 --> 03:59:20.164]  Meanwhile, the FBI and DC police continue to insist
[03:59:20.424 --> 03:59:24.107]  ...that his death was from a robbery gone bad.
[03:59:24.287 --> 03:59:25.388]  But former D.C.
[03:59:25.428 --> 03:59:30.773]  homicide detective turned private investigator Rod Wheeler says the D.C.
[03:59:30.833 --> 03:59:33.495]  police were told to stand down.
[03:59:33.515 --> 03:59:43.063]  I actually have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said, Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can't share any information with you.
[03:59:43.344 --> 03:59:46.907]  And you can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[03:59:51.761 --> 03:59:55.867]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:59:56.388 --> 03:59:57.690]  It's Alex Jones!
