[00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.714]  You're listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:00:20.155 --> 00:00:21.656]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.518 --> 00:00:25.420]  It's Tuesday, November 7th, 2017.
[00:00:25.541 --> 00:00:26.822]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.981]  We have several informative guests today and I also intend to open the phones up to take your phone calls.
[00:00:36.942 --> 00:00:42.043]  Well, President Trump is delivering yet again as the economy continues to surge.
[00:00:42.903 --> 00:00:52.886]  Countless signs show the global establishment is beginning to buckle desperately as massive prosperity is shoved in their faces.
[00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:55.347]  That is a byproduct of what Trump's doing.
[00:00:55.847 --> 00:01:04.591]  Even the ultra-rich that are anti-prosperity for the general public, by and large, are having to buckle with the global resurgence of Americana.
[00:01:04.671 --> 00:01:05.431]  It is incredible.
[00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:07.652]  And President Trump continued to deliver.
[00:01:07.692 --> 00:01:08.633]  He's now in South Korea.
[00:01:08.653 --> 00:01:09.413]  We'll get into that later.
[00:01:10.214 --> 00:01:13.795]  When they attacked him on the Second Amendment, he said, no, more guns are the answer.
[00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:16.877]  Good guys stopping bad guys.
[00:01:17.797 --> 00:01:19.979]  Not even the Republican establishment will talk like that.
[00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:21.700]  This is absolutely true.
[00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.723]  In fact, we have flat mass shootings the last 20 years.
[00:01:25.283 --> 00:01:30.127]  Overall shootings are down 61% according to the FBI's own numbers since 1992.
[00:01:30.367 --> 00:01:31.788]  They hit their peak in 1988.
[00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:42.613]  Believe me, I remember when they were having 60 murders a weekend in Dallas, and it was the murder capital of the US, not Chicago.
[00:01:42.753 --> 00:01:44.053]  I remember the peak, 1988.
[00:01:45.234 --> 00:01:46.814]  But the point is, is that it's down 61%.
[00:01:46.994 --> 00:01:49.395]  They're creating this perception.
[00:01:49.955 --> 00:01:50.856]  But still, if you're one of the 26 dead,
[00:01:52.476 --> 00:02:08.048]  It's still so real, but to see Hispanic and white and black folks hugging each other at the vigil and to see the two heroes was just amazing to see how these tragedies take us together and how the people in the town aren't letting them use it to disarm the public.
[00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:09.889]  Texas strong.
[00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:10.830]  I'm proud of my state.
[00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.172]  At the same time, I'm very, very sad by the tragedy.
[00:02:13.472 --> 00:02:19.777]  Here's a clip of the president in Seoul, South Korea, having the topic brought up to him and telling the truth.
[00:02:20.785 --> 00:02:29.651]  You've talked about wanting to put extreme vetting on people trying to come into the United States, but I wonder if you would consider extreme vetting for people trying to buy a gun?
[00:02:30.131 --> 00:02:40.818]  Well, you know, you're bringing up a situation that probably shouldn't be discussed too much right now, but it's okay if you feel that that's an appropriate question, even though we're the heart of South Korea.
[00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:42.720]  If you did what you're suggesting,
[00:02:43.638 --> 00:02:46.118]  There would have been no difference three days ago.
[00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:58.221]  And you might not have had that very brave person who happened to have a gun or a rifle in his truck go out and shoot him and hit him and neutralize him.
[00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:09.743]  And I can only say this, if he didn't have a gun, instead of having 26 dead, he would have had hundreds more dead.
[00:03:10.222 --> 00:03:13.386]  And are you considering any kind of gun control policy going forward?
[00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:18.351]  The city with the strongest gun laws in our nation is Chicago.
[00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:21.034]  And Chicago is a disaster.
[00:03:21.375 --> 00:03:27.202]  If this man didn't have a gun or a rifle, you'd be talking about a much worse situation.
[00:03:28.155 --> 00:03:29.415]  In the great state of Texas.
[00:03:30.035 --> 00:03:30.636]  Out of the park.
[00:03:30.856 --> 00:03:31.156]  Truth.
[00:03:31.316 --> 00:03:31.896]  Veritas.
[00:03:32.816 --> 00:03:34.257]  Again, I now know more M.O.
[00:03:34.337 --> 00:03:41.938]  on Trump, not just from articles I've read going back 30 years, but from people that have known him very closely, not just Stone, but Stone confirmed it all at dinner this weekend.
[00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:44.939]  Somebody's got to make a documentary about the Trumps.
[00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:52.241]  His dad was a secret John Berger funding anti-communist stuff.
[00:03:52.261 --> 00:03:53.481]  I mean, I already knew some of that.
[00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:56.502]  And Trump was like a Patriot sleeper cell.
[00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:58.890]  It's incredible.
[00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:06.712]  Just like Dr. Corsi said last year before he got elected, he said, Trump knew everything you knew, Alex, before you were born.
[00:04:07.392 --> 00:04:11.593]  And the way he played this whole thing, it's... I can't believe this is happening.
[00:04:11.993 --> 00:04:15.694]  Let's go out to break with one of the heroes who's saying he's not a hero.
[00:04:15.714 --> 00:04:18.694]  Stephen Wilford from Sutherland.
[00:04:18.714 --> 00:04:19.034]  Here it is.
[00:04:20.495 --> 00:04:22.055]  These are the people at that church.
[00:04:24.375 --> 00:04:25.336]  They're friends of mine.
[00:04:26.216 --> 00:04:26.816]  They're family.
[00:04:29.176 --> 00:04:35.278]  And every time I heard a shot, I knew that that probably represented a life.
[00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:38.699]  I was scared to death.
[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.540]  I was.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:50.103]  I was scared for me, and I was scared for every one of them, and I was scared for my own family that just lived less than a block away.
[00:04:54.383 --> 00:04:55.143]  I'm no hero.
[00:04:56.324 --> 00:04:56.964]  I am not.
[00:04:57.224 --> 00:04:59.125]  We'll be back with more of this hero.
[00:04:59.185 --> 00:04:59.586]  Stay with us.
[00:05:13.456 --> 00:05:24.322]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other materiel from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[00:05:24.362 --> 00:05:26.122]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[00:05:26.463 --> 00:05:30.465]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:05:30.505 --> 00:05:37.768]  And I want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[00:05:37.808 --> 00:05:40.169]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:42.851]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:44.372]  I don't know.
[00:06:19.722 --> 00:06:23.645]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:24.705 --> 00:06:29.429]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:37.094 --> 00:06:47.361]  If it wasn't so dangerous, it'd be comical to watch CNN, MSNBC, NBC, ABC, CBS constantly caught in fake news.
[00:06:48.681 --> 00:07:02.449]  Constantly caught doing dirty tricks against America, against Christians, against gun owners, and nastily stirring up racial and cultural divides to play us off against each other.
[00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.951]  It's just so nasty.
[00:07:05.071 --> 00:07:06.091]  It's so villainous.
[00:07:07.412 --> 00:07:10.094]  It's so scumbaggery.
[00:07:11.074 --> 00:07:12.035]  It's so low.
[00:07:13.436 --> 00:07:16.818]  But the good news is people more and more are watching it.
[00:07:17.588 --> 00:07:21.891]  They're aware of it, they're sick of it, and they're breaking with it.
[00:07:23.132 --> 00:07:42.365]  And I've got stacks of news here today from Africa to Asia to Latin America, South America, North America, the UK, where the global order of the United Nations EU program of unelected planetary government is collapsing.
[00:07:44.542 --> 00:07:50.947]  Now that it's out in the open, now that people know it's authoritarian, now that people know its aims, it is dead on arrival.
[00:07:52.388 --> 00:07:53.830]  Just as I envisioned it would be.
[00:07:54.951 --> 00:08:05.019]  Knowing that something that's authoritarian, if we just exposed it, once it finally had to emerge in the final takeover phase, people would be ready to reject it.
[00:08:05.139 --> 00:08:11.104]  Even though we'd be demonized in the process before it was admitted, by exposing it, we would be
[00:08:13.411 --> 00:08:17.672]  Absolutely the definition of credibility once it was admitted.
[00:08:18.812 --> 00:08:20.873]  And for me, that was just a common sense situation.
[00:08:21.233 --> 00:08:33.875]  But even if the general public still didn't wake up, enough thinking intellectual individuals would understand we were facing organized, authoritarian, criminal technocracy and resist it.
[00:08:34.676 --> 00:08:36.116]  And the resistance has just begun.
[00:08:36.136 --> 00:08:41.537]  But I tell you, the due sex, right out of nowhere, Donald Trump
[00:08:43.615 --> 00:09:03.790]  Completely hiding who he was, not in a deceptive way, being anti-NAFTA, anti-GATT, anti-globalist, but in his public persona, just being the hotel and casino and golf course owner, and then sucker punching the globalists so hard.
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:15.002]  I'm gonna do a whole report on his dad and his older brother and the intel that I've gotten that I was able to then confirm in news articles from 40, 50 years ago.
[00:09:15.042 --> 00:09:22.944]  I've gone to the LexisNexis, the Thomson Reuters systems and found it all here and there, but it's all true.
[00:09:24.604 --> 00:09:31.406]  Donald Trump's dad was giving to the John Birch Society and John Welch when it first was founded.
[00:09:33.012 --> 00:09:56.639]  We have a secret Ron Paul, basically, as the president, with all the stamina and with the gravitas and with the charisma that Ron Paul didn't have, and that Barry Goldwater didn't have, and that, quite frankly, Ronald Reagan didn't have.
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:02.481]  I mean, Trump has already eclipsed Reagan in what he's done in 10 months.
[00:10:04.284 --> 00:10:05.685]  But again, everything is timing.
[00:10:05.765 --> 00:10:09.967]  Reagan was not born into a time where the stakes were so high.
[00:10:11.607 --> 00:10:14.769]  Reagan was not president when the stakes were this high.
[00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:15.589]  They were serious.
[00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.551]  The globals were trying to bankrupt us and take control of us.
[00:10:19.191 --> 00:10:27.015]  But man, when Trump came in, right as the global wave was cresting against globalism, it's biblical.
[00:10:28.975 --> 00:10:29.896]  It's providence.
[00:10:32.199 --> 00:10:39.023]  And when Ronald Reagan met Trump at a White House dinner, one time he said, I felt like I was shaking the hand of the President.
[00:10:40.304 --> 00:10:41.565]  There's that photo of them meeting.
[00:10:41.585 --> 00:10:44.187]  Let's pull up Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump.
[00:10:44.207 --> 00:10:46.148]  There's just destiny, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:46.408 --> 00:10:48.429]  There's destiny written all over this.
[00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:55.534]  And everything you've done, and I've done, and Drudge has done, and all of us together, building towards the awakening,
[00:10:59.071 --> 00:11:15.505]  It's just over the top and Trump is just delivering, delivering, delivering, delivering, delivering and more and more they can't hold it back and they're panicking and they're turning on each other and the globalists are running scared at the DNC.
[00:11:16.766 --> 00:11:20.149]  The German military is planning and drilling for a breakup.
[00:11:21.644 --> 00:11:23.664]  Of the European Union in 2040?
[00:11:23.945 --> 00:11:25.065]  They don't want to panic people.
[00:11:25.105 --> 00:11:26.425]  How about five years from now?
[00:11:26.965 --> 00:11:31.226]  The European Union, as we know it, will be gone by 2022.
[00:11:33.967 --> 00:11:46.850]  Before the clock strikes December 31st, 2022, mark my words, the European Union will be completely dissolved.
[00:11:49.545 --> 00:11:53.727]  I'll be surprised if it lasts to 2020.
[00:11:56.289 --> 00:11:58.050]  You heard it here again, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:04.273]  Deep analysis, deep historical research, deep focus, deep commitment.
[00:12:05.554 --> 00:12:14.759]  And I'm telling you right now, for all intents and purposes, within two and a half years, it's going to be ceremonial, and they're going to prop it up.
[00:12:15.578 --> 00:12:21.741]  Just so the institutions can keep robbing and looting, and it will be gone in five years.
[00:12:23.261 --> 00:12:29.364]  Five years from now, the European Union will be gone.
[00:12:30.744 --> 00:12:38.707]  And it's been politically even more fast-growing and cancerous and more successful than the Soviet Union.
[00:12:38.848 --> 00:12:42.109]  Because it was able to come in through UNESCO, that Trump just pulled out of,
[00:12:43.777 --> 00:12:45.258]  And control our policies!
[00:12:45.959 --> 00:12:49.242]  UNESCO runs the State Department Immigrant Program!
[00:12:49.282 --> 00:12:51.223]  The UN decides who comes in!
[00:12:52.184 --> 00:12:59.730]  And Trump's like, seven countries don't even have real passports, and the UN says we're bringing people in from Somalia and Sudan and Libya?
[00:13:00.011 --> 00:13:03.053]  How about double hockey sticks?
[00:13:03.133 --> 00:13:03.393]  No.
[00:13:03.834 --> 00:13:05.215]  H-E double hockey sticks.
[00:13:09.018 --> 00:13:09.899]  London Telegraph.
[00:13:09.919 --> 00:13:12.161]  German army plans for breakup of the European Union.
[00:13:15.245 --> 00:13:15.825]  Analysis.
[00:13:15.845 --> 00:13:20.588]  House tax would create nearly 1 million new jobs and increase GDP by 3.9%.
[00:13:21.049 --> 00:13:26.232]  That means we'd be 7.1%.
[00:13:26.892 --> 00:13:32.315]  And they said we'd never even hit 3.
[00:13:32.736 --> 00:13:33.156]  It's 3.1.
[00:13:33.576 --> 00:13:34.417]  Eat it, globalists!
[00:13:34.797 --> 00:13:35.097]  Eat it!
[00:13:37.939 --> 00:13:39.880]  And it doesn't mean we're out of the woods, but you know what?
[00:13:42.381 --> 00:13:43.082]  They want to fight?
[00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.412]  They're about to get one, because this is just the start.
[00:13:48.933 --> 00:13:50.754]  I can smell blood, can't you?
[00:13:51.134 --> 00:13:53.996]  That coppery smell in the air.
[00:13:55.017 --> 00:13:56.758]  I smell globalist blood.
[00:13:56.778 --> 00:13:59.120]  I smell corned rats.
[00:14:00.061 --> 00:14:02.102]  Fee-fi-fo-fum.
[00:14:02.923 --> 00:14:05.144]  I smell the blood of globalist scum.
[00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:12.490]  And be they alive or be they dead, I'll grind their bones to make my bread.
[00:14:15.194 --> 00:14:17.977]  I love the fighting spirit, I can feel it rising!
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:31.230]  Oh, House Freedom Caucus backs Bill to end the diversity lottery that brought in the guy that ran over and killed a bunch of people in New York last week and injured more, killed eight people.
[00:14:32.111 --> 00:14:38.176]  He brought over 28 of his friends and family and relatives and it turns out almost none of them had jobs.
[00:14:38.857 --> 00:14:39.338]  Of course!
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:47.743]  Look, look, look, let the jihadis stay in Uzbekistan and Afghanistan and kill each other.
[00:14:48.843 --> 00:14:51.624]  And keep women as slaves and have boys sex slaves.
[00:14:53.665 --> 00:14:55.146]  Oh my gosh, I'm going to go to break.
[00:14:55.746 --> 00:14:56.546]  And I'm going to come back.
[00:14:59.188 --> 00:15:03.389]  Indonesia, which is mainly Muslim, in a bid to root out Islamists, just throws spotlights on universities.
[00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:06.751]  Yeah, the Muslims are fighting the radical Muslims everywhere.
[00:15:07.851 --> 00:15:11.013]  And then of course we knew it was coming when we come back.
[00:15:11.994 --> 00:15:16.437]  The Texas scumbag shooter was a crypto-satanist.
[00:15:16.617 --> 00:15:17.838]  That's what a lot of atheists are.
[00:15:17.858 --> 00:15:19.600]  And I'm not saying all atheists are satanists.
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.061]  A lot of nice people are atheists.
[00:15:21.081 --> 00:15:21.841]  A lot of intellectuals.
[00:15:22.061 --> 00:15:24.403]  A lot of folks that don't like corrupt churches and fake religion.
[00:15:25.124 --> 00:15:32.189]  But there are a lot of crypto-satanists that kind of push their anti-Christian agenda through being atheists.
[00:15:32.209 --> 00:15:34.390]  And it turns out atheists, a cult,
[00:15:35.359 --> 00:15:37.660]  Liked to beat up kids and was a pedophile!
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:39.501]  It's confirmed!
[00:15:39.961 --> 00:15:42.102]  That's right, was a pedophile!
[00:15:42.882 --> 00:15:57.187]  The only girls he could pick up were, you know, 12, 13 years old when he was a grown man, an arrested development thug, creepy piece of garbage that hated Christians and wanted to strike, just like Rand Paul got attacked, just like all these other attacks.
[00:15:57.407 --> 00:16:01.369]  This guy that tried to attack the White House last night came to kill the whites for November 4th.
[00:16:02.563 --> 00:16:11.209]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[00:16:11.289 --> 00:16:11.749]  That's right.

[00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:39.302]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store.
[00:16:39.482 --> 00:16:41.222]  There is no comparison.

[00:17:06.152 --> 00:17:10.114]  B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:17:10.314 --> 00:17:12.014]  Up, up, up, up, optimum levels.
[00:17:13.035 --> 00:17:17.636]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[00:17:17.656 --> 00:17:19.617]  Up, up, up, up, optimum levels.

[00:17:21.818 --> 00:17:26.880]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.681]  Up, up, up, up, optimal absorption.

[00:17:36.888 --> 00:17:37.749]  Optimal absorption.
[00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:42.734]  B vitamins help the body convert food into energy by supporting your intercellular processes.
[00:17:43.195 --> 00:17:47.399]  B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system.
[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:49.100]  Optimum levels.
[00:17:50.521 --> 00:17:54.362]  Secret 12 is an easy way to increase your vitamin B12 intake.

[00:19:02.458 --> 00:19:05.260]  America is an information-based civil war.
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:12.866]  That's why now more than ever we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalist scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[00:19:13.026 --> 00:19:18.630]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:26.737]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[00:19:27.077 --> 00:19:34.984]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[00:19:35.665 --> 00:19:40.649]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[00:19:40.709 --> 00:19:42.231]  They are the anti-liberals.
[00:19:42.831 --> 00:19:55.882]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more Patriot apparel at InfowarStore.com.
[00:19:56.242 --> 00:20:00.265]  Be part of the Second American Revolution at InfowarStore.com.
[00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:08.392]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:21.343 --> 00:20:32.237]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:20:36.442 --> 00:20:39.085]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:47.935 --> 00:21:00.399]  By the way, folks, things are moving so fast here at InfoWars that I don't even have time to cover all the special events we're doing or to plug their coming up.
[00:21:01.459 --> 00:21:09.182]  We had live Saturday coverage of Antifa's supposed national uprising, which was a dud, but then we saw Rand Paul attacked.
[00:21:09.642 --> 00:21:16.644]  We saw the guy try to attack the White House and, in quote, kill as many white police as he could last night, another Antifa-connected fella.
[00:21:17.744 --> 00:21:18.705]  Another deranged lunatic.
[00:21:18.725 --> 00:21:24.791]  We've seen the atheist, crypto-Satanist, death worshipper who was anti-Christian attack this church.
[00:21:25.592 --> 00:21:29.836]  We've seen the leftist connections of the Vegas shooter and the connections to Saudi Arabia.
[00:21:30.757 --> 00:21:38.144]  So, we covered those big events on Saturday and then Sunday we were also live for most of the day.
[00:21:39.907 --> 00:21:43.070]  Starting tomorrow at 8 a.m.
[00:21:43.551 --> 00:21:51.739]  Central with David Knight and The Real News right through to the end of the broadcast the next day with Owen Schroyer at 6 p.m.
[00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.502]  Central with The War Room.
[00:21:54.542 --> 00:22:01.449]  We're gonna broadcast 30 plus hours live with our amazing intrepid crew.
[00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:13.721]  So again, more and more live broadcast, more and more live radio slash TV shows, more syndicated programs with The War Room and Real News and InfoWars Live with yours truly, Alex Jones.
[00:22:14.281 --> 00:22:15.883]  But starting tomorrow, 8 a.m.
[00:22:15.923 --> 00:22:25.152]  Central, 34-hour coverage, American Rebirth and Renaissance, one year after the historic victory
[00:22:26.892 --> 00:22:31.355]  We're celebrating all the really positive things that have happened in one basket.
[00:22:32.095 --> 00:22:34.096]  We've got a big scale we're actually going to have on air.
[00:22:34.477 --> 00:22:41.921]  And then some of the bad things that we haven't been able to get done yet or that Trump hasn't completely delivered on, we're going to be discussing that as well.
[00:22:41.981 --> 00:22:43.162]  The good, the bad, and the ugly.
[00:22:44.397 --> 00:22:50.399]  This is all part of the negotiation with Trump, and he is basically taking the globalists to the woodshed.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:55.301]  So tomorrow, historic transmission broadcast, 8 a.m.
[00:22:56.282 --> 00:23:02.624]  right through to the next day, 6 p.m., 34-hour continued live transmission.
[00:23:03.425 --> 00:23:11.068]  We've made a lot of mini-documentaries about the first 100 days and the next 100 days, and now 10 months in, we're going to chronicle
[00:23:12.205 --> 00:23:19.892]  And take your phone calls and have special guests on and talk about all the incredibly exciting things that have happened.
[00:23:20.032 --> 00:23:21.453]  All the things that have unfolded.
[00:23:21.754 --> 00:23:23.075]  The killing of TPP.
[00:23:23.355 --> 00:23:25.777]  The renegotiation of NAFTA and GATT.
[00:23:25.977 --> 00:23:28.220]  69% reduction in illegals coming across the borders.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:34.305]  50 plus percent more visits for veterans going to the VA.
[00:23:34.705 --> 00:23:35.966]  Opening up private clinics.
[00:23:36.827 --> 00:23:38.708]  The stock market up at record levels.
[00:23:39.048 --> 00:23:41.228]  Record new jobs coming back to the U.S.
[00:23:41.548 --> 00:23:43.909]  Wages being the highest they've been since 1984.
[00:23:44.989 --> 00:23:47.410]  A new job startup, some of the best in U.S.
[00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:48.290]  history.
[00:23:49.211 --> 00:23:57.113]  Consumer confidence way up, all because optimism's back in, and we believe in prosperity again, and we believe in innovation again.
[00:23:57.133 --> 00:23:59.634]  That's called the American system.
[00:24:00.034 --> 00:24:04.255]  That's the flower of the Enlightenment and the Renaissance, and it's back!
[00:24:05.322 --> 00:24:07.223]  With Donald John Trump.
[00:24:07.563 --> 00:24:08.704]  It's back with you.
[00:24:09.604 --> 00:24:10.565]  It's back with me.
[00:24:10.665 --> 00:24:12.165]  It's back with all of us.
[00:24:12.666 --> 00:24:13.906]  And it's about optimism.
[00:24:13.946 --> 00:24:15.087]  It's not about a utopia.
[00:24:15.607 --> 00:24:19.589]  It's about stopping the globalist dystopia and moving forward.
[00:24:20.765 --> 00:24:29.151]  And it starts with private citizens taking care of their families, and standing up for each other, and having a real sense of community, and a real sense of coming together.
[00:24:29.371 --> 00:24:35.355]  And that's what real Christians have, and that's why globalists and communists all over the world strive to ban it.
[00:24:36.135 --> 00:24:49.808]  Because in Sutherland, Texas, we see Hispanics, whites, blacks folks, all coming together, many of them married, with children, loving each other, at that memorial service yesterday that brought tears to my eyes when I watched it last night.
[00:24:49.948 --> 00:24:51.049]  I watched the tape of the live.
[00:24:52.691 --> 00:24:55.234]  So let's play a clip right now of Stephen Wilford
[00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:13.211]  Who again is an NRA trainer.
[00:25:13.611 --> 00:25:27.475]  They tried to blame the NRA for the attack as if an organization is to blame for another Antifa person in a black uniform who hated God and hated Christians and was also a pedophile, we're now learning, who illegally got a gun.
[00:25:28.095 --> 00:25:32.296]  The Air Force should have transferred the files over because of his dishonorable discharge.
[00:25:32.637 --> 00:25:33.837]  He shouldn't have got the gun.
[00:25:33.917 --> 00:25:40.319]  So again, the system itself from someone who was already banned from having firearms broke down.
[00:25:41.889 --> 00:25:46.332]  So here, ladies and gentlemen, is the hero who says he wasn't a hero.
[00:25:48.334 --> 00:25:49.835]  It's the people at that church.
[00:25:52.137 --> 00:25:53.097]  They're friends of mine.
[00:25:53.117 --> 00:25:54.618]  They're family.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:03.065]  And every time I heard a shot, I knew that that probably represented a life.
[00:26:05.126 --> 00:26:06.507]  I was scared to death.
[00:26:07.928 --> 00:26:08.289]  I was.
[00:26:09.978 --> 00:26:17.908]  I was scared for me, and I was scared for every one of them, and I was scared for my own family that just lived less than a block away.
[00:26:17.928 --> 00:26:20.812]  I'm no hero.
[00:26:21.132 --> 00:26:21.593]  I am not.
[00:26:27.581 --> 00:26:37.005]  I think my God, my Lord, protected me and gave me the skills to do what needed to be done.
[00:26:37.525 --> 00:26:42.087]  And I just wish I could have gotten there faster, but I didn't know.
[00:26:42.627 --> 00:26:43.927]  I didn't know what was happening.
[00:26:44.567 --> 00:26:51.930]  And we're not blaming any of the victims, but I never carried a firearm all the time until the last year.
[00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:53.171]  And it's because of Antifa.
[00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:55.131]  And all the rest of these people.
[00:26:55.911 --> 00:27:01.274]  And I get to be in the position the police officers are in, where I am a target because the left knows who I am.
[00:27:03.415 --> 00:27:09.319]  If they don't know who you are, and you're a Christian, a conservative, a libertarian, you don't get to experience it unless you have a bumper sticker or a t-shirt on.
[00:27:09.859 --> 00:27:23.147]  But if you're a police officer, it doesn't matter what color you are, the average leftist will spit at you, will file false complaints on you, will try to run you off the road, will physically attack you, or will shoot you in the back of your head.
[00:27:25.495 --> 00:27:31.159]  And so, I don't make that point to say, oh look, I'm this victim, oh look, I go through what police go through.
[00:27:31.579 --> 00:27:32.900]  It's that I'm identifiable.
[00:27:33.381 --> 00:27:37.143]  That the globalist and the leftist and their followers know who I am.
[00:27:40.405 --> 00:27:45.329]  And so, you don't know what that's like unless you're somebody in a uniform or who is recognizable.
[00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:50.052]  And when you're recognizable, you learn just how dangerous they are, and it is a wake-up call.
[00:27:50.312 --> 00:27:53.835]  Where I carry a firearm and have security now, because I have to.
[00:27:55.131 --> 00:27:56.652]  Because everybody's seen what they do on the streets.
[00:27:56.713 --> 00:27:57.513]  They're animals.
[00:27:57.934 --> 00:27:58.714]  They're crazy.
[00:27:59.595 --> 00:28:06.742]  Here's President Trump talking about good men standing up against bad men and that good men with guns stop bad guys with guns from South Korea.
[00:28:06.782 --> 00:28:07.263]  Here's part of it.
[00:28:08.041 --> 00:28:16.891]  You've talked about wanting to put extreme vetting on people trying to come into the United States, but I wonder if you would consider extreme vetting for people trying to buy a gun?
[00:28:17.371 --> 00:28:28.063]  Well, you know, you're bringing up a situation that probably shouldn't be discussed too much right now, but it's okay if you feel that that's an appropriate question, even though we're the heart of South Korea.
[00:28:28.403 --> 00:28:29.965]  If you did what you're suggesting,
[00:28:30.891 --> 00:28:33.372]  There would have been no difference three days ago.
[00:28:34.133 --> 00:28:45.459]  And you might not have had that very brave person who happened to have a gun or a rifle in his truck go out and shoot him and hit him and neutralize him.
[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:57.006]  And I can only say this, if he didn't have a gun, instead of having 26 dead, he would have had hundreds more dead.
[00:28:57.475 --> 00:29:00.456]  And are you considering any kind of gun control policy going forward?
[00:29:00.676 --> 00:29:02.377]  That's our president, folks, the real deal.
[00:29:02.917 --> 00:29:04.058]  Take a look at this study.
[00:29:04.558 --> 00:29:08.599]  Prenatal pollution exposure linked to decreased telomere length.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.741]  Telomeres is something you may have heard of recently.
[00:29:12.141 --> 00:29:17.263]  It is what is at the end of your DNA that is responsible for the aging process.
[00:29:17.603 --> 00:29:20.245]  This is a very important part of our human chemistry.
[00:29:20.486 --> 00:29:27.071]  So you already know that we live in an environment that is just loaded with toxic chemicals.
[00:29:27.511 --> 00:29:35.979]  Now they're finding that that environment is actually affecting babies in the prenatal stage, specifically when it comes to the telomeres.
[00:29:36.279 --> 00:29:40.863]  So now you have babies prematurely aging because of all the toxins.
[00:29:41.283 --> 00:29:42.785]  So what does InfoWars do, folks?
[00:29:43.085 --> 00:29:52.114]  We find a solution and we offer you the best, most groundbreaking product to deal with protecting and keeping your telomeres healthy.

[00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:42.452]  Playing basketball in the dry summer heat really makes me sweat.
[00:30:43.112 --> 00:30:45.914]  To maintain my game, I need all the confidence I can get.
[00:30:46.535 --> 00:30:51.418]  That's why I use Emmerich's Essentials natural deodorant, made with organic ingredients.
[00:30:51.778 --> 00:30:58.082]  This deodorant combines mineral crystals with natural botanicals to ionize odor, keeping me fresh throughout the day.
[00:30:58.442 --> 00:31:03.546]  While shooting hoops, the last thing I want is sweaty armpits making my hands slippery and the ball wet.
[00:31:04.286 --> 00:31:07.687]  That's why I recommend Emmerich's Essentials Fragrance-Free Deodorant.
[00:31:08.267 --> 00:31:16.089]  Even though it's unscented, it's effective at combating strong body odor, and I don't have to worry about any unwanted allergic reactions to my sensitive skin.
[00:31:16.669 --> 00:31:21.010]  Whether you're a guy or gal, the last thing you want to be worried about is your deodorant.
[00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:25.271]  No petroleum-based ingredients, 100% natural and cruelty-free.
[00:31:25.571 --> 00:31:29.392]  Stay in the game with Emmerich's Essentials Fragrance-Free Natural Deodorant.

[00:31:32.293 --> 00:31:33.893]  There's a lot of clutter on the internet.
[00:31:33.993 --> 00:31:37.094]  I want to tell you where you can find our new program, Real News with David Knight.
[00:31:37.114 --> 00:31:39.375]  You can find it on Twitter at RealNewsX2.
[00:31:39.415 --> 00:31:41.435]  Same thing on Facebook.
[00:31:41.455 --> 00:31:44.416]  We have a YouTube channel, Real News with David Knight.
[00:31:44.576 --> 00:31:50.558]  And you can watch the live stream every Monday through Friday at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:31:50.578 --> 00:31:51.298]  See you there.
[00:31:51.318 --> 00:31:54.218]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[00:31:54.679 --> 00:31:58.540]  Whenever you want to have a debate with a state liberal, you always resort to violence.
[00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:00.040]  We need to wake people up.
[00:32:02.156 --> 00:32:06.640]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind super blue fluoride free products.
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:14.186]  InfoWars Life brings you a revolutionary toothpaste blend with iodine and nano silver designed to deliver a powerful clean.
[00:32:14.446 --> 00:32:18.389]  Enjoy a minty fresh flavor made with peppermint oil or try our bubblegum flavor.

[00:32:24.812 --> 00:32:31.196]  Our amazing mouthwash features natural oils and ancient ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times.
[00:32:31.416 --> 00:32:41.541]  Instead of containing fluoride, our Super Blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral health benefits.
[00:32:41.781 --> 00:32:43.921]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:27.316 --> 00:33:34.820]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[00:33:35.801 --> 00:33:39.703]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:40.143 --> 00:33:43.985]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:33:44.345 --> 00:33:45.986]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:46.687 --> 00:33:55.992]  President Obama bowed to the Saudi King.
[00:33:56.012 --> 00:33:56.612]  She bowed.
[00:33:58.163 --> 00:34:01.285]  To the Emperor of Japan, he bowed to basically anybody that would give him money.
[00:34:02.366 --> 00:34:15.736]  It was very symbolic yesterday when President Trump met with the Emperor of Japan and did not bow to him.
[00:34:15.756 --> 00:34:18.979]  And of course the Emperor did not bow to him either.
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.823]  It was a nice little nod to the forehead of respect like you do anybody.
[00:34:25.006 --> 00:34:28.669]  Impeccable ethics and etiquette.
[00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:35.954]  And of course he did just like the Japanese Prime Minister did when they first did a few scoops of the koi and then dumped the whole box in, that's what you do.
[00:34:36.435 --> 00:34:41.819]  And the media said, oh look at the ethics, he's an idiot, he's a moron, he's a fool.
[00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:47.944]  And they zoomed in on the President artificially from the wide shot.
[00:34:49.207 --> 00:34:54.428]  Showing him, dump the full box in and saying that the Japanese were shocked by it.
[00:34:54.948 --> 00:34:57.909]  Lying about every angle there is.
[00:34:58.889 --> 00:35:00.649]  And sure, you're like, okay, they lied about that.
[00:35:00.969 --> 00:35:03.169]  They'll lie about anything and everything.
[00:35:03.209 --> 00:35:17.152]  They literally twist every angle they can to make our president look like a buffoon because he's actually working for you to bring prosperity back and cut your taxes and right the economy and cut the deficit.
[00:35:18.826 --> 00:35:20.867]  It's just incredible to witness it.
[00:35:24.369 --> 00:35:45.622]  Coming up in the next segment, they had congressional hearings last Friday, and I guess no one noticed until yesterday, there was an article written at Infowars.com, where they have members of Congress and the tech giant heads
[00:35:48.903 --> 00:35:51.986]  Actually say InfoWars must be banned.
[00:35:53.147 --> 00:35:55.830]  And they say, yes, we're trying to ban them now.
[00:35:56.671 --> 00:35:59.734]  We need AI to really stop InfoWars.
[00:36:00.235 --> 00:36:01.696]  I mean, you cannot make it up.
[00:36:01.956 --> 00:36:03.278]  I'm going to play that in the next segment.
[00:36:04.038 --> 00:36:05.420]  I should have started the broadcast with it.
[00:36:07.383 --> 00:36:08.103]  What are they scared of?
[00:36:08.383 --> 00:36:17.507]  They're scared that we're going to show you the full video of Trump doing what the Prime Minister did, and then we're going to show the video CNN edited.
[00:36:17.567 --> 00:36:19.208]  I mean, that's why they don't like us, folks.
[00:36:21.368 --> 00:36:27.871]  It's the same reason they don't like Drudge, because Drudge had the same video up yesterday showing how they lied.
[00:36:29.238 --> 00:36:30.739]  They just don't want us there.
[00:36:31.499 --> 00:36:37.702]  And there's a famous imam that did warn de Blasio in person and at rallies that Islamists were planning truck attacks.
[00:36:38.303 --> 00:36:39.683]  He's been all over Fox News, you name it.
[00:36:42.125 --> 00:36:47.187]  They say that's the fake news that Paul Watson wrote about and that they want it banned.
[00:36:48.848 --> 00:36:54.271]  And then the head of technology for Twitter says, yes, we're working on stopping InfoWars.
[00:36:57.270 --> 00:37:03.052]  And then there's links to videos and tweets of the Imam on Fox News warning de Blasio!
[00:37:03.672 --> 00:37:09.734]  I mean... That's coming up next segment.
[00:37:09.874 --> 00:37:11.374]  It's coming up next... I mean, I'm gonna play these videos.
[00:37:11.494 --> 00:37:13.115]  It's astounding.
[00:37:16.636 --> 00:37:17.536]  Before I go any further...
[00:37:19.167 --> 00:37:21.208]  If they can shut us up, they can shut you up.
[00:37:21.268 --> 00:37:24.210]  And I know I say that every hour or so, because it's true.
[00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:33.495]  And without you remembering InfoWars, and without you financially supporting us, and supporting our local affiliates, and buying the products, we're not going to be here.
[00:37:33.815 --> 00:37:34.756]  Because they're coming after us.
[00:37:35.036 --> 00:37:43.901]  And they're trying to block us everywhere where we can naturally reach people, and then naturally they've shut down our sponsors, and kicked us off Google Ads, and they're just hitting us everywhere.
[00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:46.590]  Ad roll.
[00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:49.832]  I mean, you see it in the news every week, where we're being banned here, banned there.
[00:37:51.033 --> 00:37:58.658]  But still, you've come through, so we're getting more aminetham affiliates, more TV affiliates, more cable affiliates, who we don't list, so they don't get harassed.
[00:37:59.238 --> 00:38:00.039]  They just get the support.
[00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:05.342]  And we're growing, despite them trying to stop us.
[00:38:06.543 --> 00:38:10.946]  But believe me, they're test modeling us to shut everybody else down.
[00:38:12.642 --> 00:38:24.690]  So I need you to go to infowarestore.com and pick a great vitamin or mineral or other supplement you need, or the high-quality non-GMO coffee from southern Mexico in the Chiapas Mountains there.
[00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:27.192]  It's my favorite coffee.
[00:38:27.792 --> 00:38:29.953]  And just sign up for auto-ship, an additional 10% off.
[00:38:30.214 --> 00:38:34.817]  That way, every 15 days, every month, every 60, every 90, it's just one click, you can cancel anytime.
[00:38:35.237 --> 00:38:41.201]  It gets mailed to you, and so we get that little stipend, or that little tithe for the Republic, the war bonds.
[00:38:43.752 --> 00:38:49.577]  To help fund this operation and expand in the face of the globalists and get more crew and take care of the great crew we've got.
[00:38:49.637 --> 00:38:55.983]  So please, commit today to go to Infowarsstore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:38:56.023 --> 00:38:57.804]  We have high quality, fluoride free.
[00:39:01.175 --> 00:39:05.297]  Toothpaste with colloidal silver and iodine in it, super blue, and we have it for children.
[00:39:05.637 --> 00:39:08.219]  We have the super blue mouthwash, it's super high quality and concentrated.
[00:39:08.579 --> 00:39:11.400]  We have DNA Force sold out for months, almost four months back in stock.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.841]  Our biodefense probiotic is the best out there.
[00:39:15.042 --> 00:39:17.623]  We're working on stuff even more potent and powerful.
[00:39:18.084 --> 00:39:22.006]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139 and we have the new t-shirt of the month.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:33.085]  And it's just this month, it's a knockoff of the antifa symbol, but it's an American flag and a Gadsden flag, and it says we're anti-fascist and anti-communist.
[00:39:33.465 --> 00:39:34.606]  It absolutely triggers them.
[00:39:34.686 --> 00:39:35.527]  It's a great seller.
[00:39:35.987 --> 00:39:37.468]  It's $13, folks.
[00:39:38.689 --> 00:39:40.350]  The new t-shirt of the month is discounted.
[00:39:42.671 --> 00:39:43.732]  Great way to spread the word.
[00:39:43.752 --> 00:39:45.613]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:39:45.653 --> 00:39:48.875]  And we've only got, what, two, three weeks left if you've been able to get that shirt.
[00:39:49.436 --> 00:39:50.657]  Gavin Wendt's coming up with the design.
[00:39:50.697 --> 00:39:51.457]  Great job, Gavin.
[00:39:51.877 --> 00:39:52.818]  Okay, that's it.
[00:39:58.117 --> 00:40:14.648]  The usual suspects have come out, people like Piers Morgan, and demonized the Texas Attorney General that said he believes we don't need more gun control because what we need is law-abiding citizens to be armed so that when crazy psychopaths occasionally do what we're seeing happen, good people are able to stand up against them.
[00:40:15.148 --> 00:40:23.553]  And believe me, folks, if you research the data as we've done, you see the evidence that Paddock and this latest creature, Kelly,
[00:40:24.714 --> 00:40:32.745]  Are crypto-atheist, devil-worshipper, scumbag types who, as usual, I said are connected to pedophilia.
[00:40:33.466 --> 00:40:35.588]  Now Paddock's brother's been arrested for child porn.
[00:40:36.389 --> 00:40:37.451]  The other one for drug dealing.
[00:40:39.415 --> 00:40:46.361]  Now it's come out that Kelly was a pedophile, had been caught being a pedophile, and also had fractured his wife's child's skull.
[00:40:47.082 --> 00:40:53.187]  The Air Force didn't do its job and send forward the file to the FBI into the database, the NICS database.
[00:40:53.207 --> 00:40:54.608]  He would have been barred from buying firearms.
[00:40:55.429 --> 00:40:57.151]  So it was illegal for him to own guns.
[00:40:58.203 --> 00:40:59.884]  And so that's all confirmed today.
[00:41:00.584 --> 00:41:04.826]  But what makes me sick about Piers Morgan is he has armed response at his L.A.
[00:41:04.866 --> 00:41:05.106]  home.
[00:41:05.146 --> 00:41:05.846]  That's been confirmed.
[00:41:05.866 --> 00:41:06.767]  Project Veritas showed it.
[00:41:07.027 --> 00:41:11.929]  An armed van that drives around with guys with semi-automatic shotguns and rifles in front of his house.
[00:41:12.829 --> 00:41:13.790]  And he's got bodyguards.
[00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:14.430]  I've run into him.
[00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:15.691]  I was on a show.
[00:41:15.711 --> 00:41:18.532]  They tried to kind of bully me as I left the building like I was scared of them.
[00:41:18.552 --> 00:41:19.032]  Give me a break.
[00:41:20.733 --> 00:41:25.575]  And he's now attacked the Attorney General of Texas
[00:41:26.638 --> 00:41:32.321]  And Lieutenant Governor and others, similarly, for saying exactly what President Trump said yesterday.
[00:41:32.901 --> 00:41:34.622]  Calling them idiots, calling them morons.
[00:41:36.222 --> 00:41:37.383]  Here's the first one right here.
[00:41:38.123 --> 00:41:41.725]  Cuomo, also is demonized, but you're a brainless moron.
[00:41:42.045 --> 00:41:48.868]  Here's Morgan Blass, Texas Attorney General, after he claims the only way to stop mass shootings is for more people to take guns to church.
[00:41:49.368 --> 00:41:49.928]  Which is true.
[00:41:49.988 --> 00:41:53.190]  You need to have security everywhere now, because if you're a Christian or conservative, you're a target.
[00:41:54.929 --> 00:41:57.330]  Well, he's calling him a moron, but Trump says that.
[00:41:57.370 --> 00:42:02.394]  But see, Morgan wants to cozy up to Trump, so he doesn't attack Trump, he just attacks a surrogate.
[00:42:02.774 --> 00:42:04.935]  He's a total calculating fraud.
[00:42:05.936 --> 00:42:08.937]  Here's Piers Morgan, and then we'll come back with other clips.
[00:42:10.278 --> 00:42:11.479]  Obviously the answer, isn't it?
[00:42:11.679 --> 00:42:13.420]  You brainless morons.
[00:42:14.781 --> 00:42:17.903]  Sorry, that's what you are, Texas Attorney General.
[00:42:18.263 --> 00:42:19.904]  A brainless moron.
[00:42:20.785 --> 00:42:21.285]  Moron.
[00:42:22.065 --> 00:42:22.746]  Unfortunately.
[00:42:24.641 --> 00:42:28.985]  The response being either it's not a gun situation or more guns.
[00:42:29.045 --> 00:42:31.367]  How can it not be a gun situation Mr. Trump?
[00:42:32.426 --> 00:42:35.227]  We have psychotic devil worshippers that want to kill us.
[00:42:35.707 --> 00:42:38.669]  Statistically, gun crime's down 61% since 1992.
[00:42:39.089 --> 00:42:40.009]  FBI statistics.
[00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:41.790]  Mass shootings are flat.
[00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:43.691]  They're trying to hype up more of them.
[00:42:44.011 --> 00:42:45.772]  We will protect ourselves, filth.
[00:42:46.432 --> 00:42:47.172]  You understand that?
[00:42:47.793 --> 00:42:48.753]  Hitler took the guns.
[00:42:48.833 --> 00:42:49.854]  Stalin took the guns.
[00:42:50.194 --> 00:42:51.114]  Mao took the guns.
[00:42:51.474 --> 00:42:56.336]  And if you try to take our firearms, 1776 will commence again!
[00:42:56.537 --> 00:42:59.358]  Is that clear, you little hypocritical filth bag?
[00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:07.641]  I like to do things where I know I can at least take control of it myself, personally.
[00:43:09.142 --> 00:43:19.025]  And this isn't a pitch for water filtration, but we go out and find the very best gravity-fed water filters, where it takes out all the garbage, but doesn't take out the good minerals, and then I put my drinking water through that.
[00:43:20.145 --> 00:43:23.986]  And if I'm lazy, I've got reverse osmosis, which really cleans the water, but cuts out the minerals.
[00:43:24.286 --> 00:43:28.048]  So over time, it's probably not too good for you to only drink reverse osmosis.
[00:43:28.088 --> 00:43:29.148]  That's in all the studies.
[00:43:29.708 --> 00:43:32.109]  But the other big area is the shampoo.
[00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:41.017]  And the sunscreens and the cosmetics and the body washes and the soap, which isn't really soap.
[00:43:41.658 --> 00:43:48.885]  So we've spent, and this is a plug, but it's really informational until the bottom of the hour when Sheriff Arpaio joins us.
[00:43:49.305 --> 00:43:57.232]  We spent years saying we want to get an organic, high quality line of toiletries and personal care products.
[00:43:58.294 --> 00:44:02.755]  So that I can use them in my own home and know from the manufacturer, it's really what they say.
[00:44:03.575 --> 00:44:14.678]  And folks, we got Mark Gonsalves, the owner of Nature's Brands, one of the biggest organic brands in the country, one of the top sellers at Whole Foods.
[00:44:14.958 --> 00:44:17.158]  Everybody recognizes our labeling because he's so nice.
[00:44:17.518 --> 00:44:21.459]  He even let us use basically his labeling, but changed the name to Emmerich's Essentials.
[00:44:21.499 --> 00:44:26.000]  So whether you get it at Whole Foods under his name or from us, what's best about it is
[00:44:27.839 --> 00:44:33.924]  It's on the low end of cost, but better than a lot of the other so-called organic brands and is so respected.
[00:44:33.944 --> 00:44:36.126]  But I wanted to get him on because he's the expert.
[00:44:36.766 --> 00:44:43.952]  He's got a bunch of the brands there of what's in some of the other leading brands and some of the other supposed natural brands that really aren't organic.
[00:44:43.972 --> 00:44:46.334]  But Emmerich Essentials is nature's brand.
[00:44:46.514 --> 00:44:48.776]  We're under a chemical assault.
[00:44:49.156 --> 00:44:50.598]  It's unbelievable to me
[00:44:51.397 --> 00:44:52.918]  What we've allowed to take place.
[00:44:53.138 --> 00:44:57.240]  We've got 84,000 chemicals now in play.
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:01.082]  13,000 of which are used in our cosmetics and personal care items.
[00:45:01.142 --> 00:45:02.923]  And we use these things every single day.
[00:45:03.982 --> 00:45:06.484]  Yet about 10% have ever been tested.
[00:45:06.945 --> 00:45:14.472]  So we always rely on the chemical company to be able to be considered innocent until we end up proving them guilty.
[00:45:14.532 --> 00:45:15.833]  Does that make any sense at all?
[00:45:16.333 --> 00:45:21.458]  So all these things that we put on our body, they're going into our bloodstream.
[00:45:21.738 --> 00:45:24.961]  Takes about 28 seconds to go into our bloodstream.
[00:45:25.202 --> 00:45:26.343]  So here's what we've got.
[00:45:26.623 --> 00:45:28.625]  We've got the FDA that says, hey, you know what?
[00:45:29.278 --> 00:45:30.739]  For external use only.
[00:45:30.759 --> 00:45:31.679]  Think about this.
[00:45:31.759 --> 00:45:32.319]  Think about this.
[00:45:32.359 --> 00:45:33.800]  They say it's for external use only.
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:35.420]  They're not stupid at the FDA.
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.821]  They know it goes into your bloodstream.
[00:45:38.441 --> 00:45:41.262]  What is the establishment going to do when all this comes out?
[00:45:41.483 --> 00:45:44.043]  It's already come out about bisphenol A and atrazine.
[00:45:44.284 --> 00:45:45.764]  And then they're still putting it in stuff.
[00:45:45.864 --> 00:45:47.505]  What's going to happen?
[00:45:47.805 --> 00:45:49.746]  Why are they doing it when I've looked it up?
[00:45:49.786 --> 00:45:53.947]  They've got chemicals that are even less expensive that they could be using that have less problems.
[00:45:54.167 --> 00:45:55.768]  It's like they go out of their way to do this.
[00:45:56.908 --> 00:46:00.952]  I think that companies today, are they purposely trying to kill us?
[00:46:00.972 --> 00:46:06.836]  I don't know if I'm going to go quite that far, but what I will say is, they don't seem to care if they do.
[00:46:08.198 --> 00:46:09.078]  They don't seem to care.
[00:46:09.098 --> 00:46:09.559]  Exactly.
[00:46:09.919 --> 00:46:17.925]  Just like Bayer with the hemophiliac factor VIII, they knew it was in there, and they said, you know what, we'll lose money, go ahead and ship these millions of dosages.
[00:46:17.945 --> 00:46:18.526]  They just didn't care.
[00:46:19.685 --> 00:46:20.605]  Exactly.
[00:46:20.665 --> 00:46:23.666]  Hey, as a young person, it was Ford with the Pintel, right?
[00:46:24.287 --> 00:46:26.587]  Oh yeah, well, we have 30 gas tanks that will blow up.
[00:46:26.607 --> 00:46:33.670]  Yeah, we'll get sued for millions and millions of dollars, but hey, at the end of the day, that's a heck of a lot cheaper than having to replace all those gas tanks in a recall.
[00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:35.991]  I mean, golly, we've got a business to protect.
[00:46:36.671 --> 00:46:40.192]  Again, when you place a person's well-being
[00:46:41.495 --> 00:46:48.899]  The bottom rung of the ladder and you place purely profit at the top, that is something seriously wrong.
[00:46:49.019 --> 00:46:49.980]  Well, we're really impressed.
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:51.201]  Mark, thank you so much.
[00:46:51.241 --> 00:46:52.241]  NaturesBrands.com.

[00:47:01.366 --> 00:47:02.927]  Mark Gonzalez, thank you so much, sir.
[00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:08.730]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:16.739 --> 00:47:25.489]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:27.291]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:47:27.811 --> 00:47:31.515]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:47:33.987 --> 00:47:40.572]  American Rebirth and Renaissance, one year after the historic victory, kicks off tomorrow at 8 a.m.
[00:47:40.612 --> 00:47:43.254]  Central with the Real News with David Knight, 11 a.m.

[00:47:57.285 --> 00:47:59.829]  34-hour transmission.
[00:47:59.869 --> 00:48:03.295]  We're going to play whole 30-minute clips.
[00:48:05.696 --> 00:48:24.608]  Of election night last year when the left got the message at 3 in the morning and Trump coming in and his victory speech and Newsweek already printing up that Hillary had won and then the leftist and the howling and them attacking people on inauguration day.
[00:48:25.108 --> 00:48:29.751]  And then we're going to look at all the accomplishments, where we failed, where we need to redouble our efforts
[00:48:30.271 --> 00:48:37.036]  This is going to be an important retrospective and then looking forward tomorrow at 8 a.m.
[00:48:37.097 --> 00:48:56.492]  Central InfoWars.com forward slash show show whether it's the Libertarian that's his handle on Twitter or Real Alex Jones or Prison Planet with Paul follow it all on Twitter Facebook YouTube everywhere you'll be able to see the live broadcast.
[00:48:58.442 --> 00:49:02.704]  But not for long, if they have their way.
[00:49:03.425 --> 00:49:04.185]  Not for long.
[00:49:05.606 --> 00:49:24.477]  Jamie White wrote a story for Infowars.com and Newswars yesterday, and I saw it during the show, and I was aware we were brought up during the hearings last Friday, but I hadn't read the transcript or watched large segments of it, because I'm used to Congress and mainstream media and the globalists, you know, lying about us and saying we should be shut up.
[00:49:25.302 --> 00:49:31.687]  They're just trying to get us all conditioned to the fact that, oh, we're going to ban your free speech and just shut you up or put you in prison for no reason.
[00:49:31.727 --> 00:49:32.247]  How's that sound?
[00:49:32.928 --> 00:49:36.791]  And they've even kind of gotten me comfortable with it, like, oh, those are the gallows you're building for me.
[00:49:36.811 --> 00:49:38.532]  You're going to march me up there and hang me.
[00:49:38.872 --> 00:49:41.154]  You're going to bring me a six-pack of beer first, right?
[00:49:42.615 --> 00:49:44.156]  I mean, that's how crazy this is.
[00:49:44.237 --> 00:49:46.418]  And then I started watching the videos.
[00:49:46.979 --> 00:49:48.400]  And then I started reading the transcripts.
[00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:49.801]  And this went on for hours.
[00:49:49.821 --> 00:49:54.985]  And I'm going to play just two short clips for you right now in the interest of time.
[00:49:56.792 --> 00:50:00.733]  And it is truly unbelievable.
[00:50:03.174 --> 00:50:04.855]  They have Congressman Wigley.
[00:50:06.415 --> 00:50:08.516]  You can't make that up.
[00:50:09.176 --> 00:50:09.957]  From Illinois.
[00:50:12.257 --> 00:50:14.738]  To me, he just looks like the son of Dennis Hastert.
[00:50:15.018 --> 00:50:15.479]  Just saying.
[00:50:15.819 --> 00:50:16.719]  Just looks just like him.
[00:50:17.119 --> 00:50:17.859]  Talks just like him.
[00:50:17.899 --> 00:50:18.780]  Has the same affect.
[00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:20.240]  Just saying!
[00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:21.361]  Just saying!
[00:50:22.761 --> 00:50:24.862]  Just saying, you know, he's a creepy looking dude.
[00:50:26.032 --> 00:50:30.175]  But the point is, he's also involved in all sorts of globalist operations.
[00:50:30.215 --> 00:50:35.178]  He is a creepy person when it comes to assaulting our Bill of Rights and our Constitution.
[00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:44.265]  And Mr. Piggly Wiggly gets up there with the heads of Google, Twitter, and Facebook, the actual heads of operations.
[00:50:45.546 --> 00:50:48.328]  And boy, if these guys aren't spooks, I'm a monkey's uncle.
[00:50:48.648 --> 00:50:52.430]  I mean, these are intelligence operatives right out of Langley, baby, and right out of the NSA.
[00:50:53.604 --> 00:51:06.629]  So he's got government operatives right in front of him in the tech operations that Trump's about to break up with antitrust operations against these foreign globalist satellites that have gotten control of our country.
[00:51:08.610 --> 00:51:12.331]  And he says Infowars put out fake news that's everywhere.
[00:51:14.142 --> 00:51:15.443]  And what are we going to do about it?
[00:51:15.503 --> 00:51:17.645]  And they go on to say, yes, we know it's fake, we want to get rid of it.
[00:51:17.966 --> 00:51:21.950]  We're working with AI, artificial intelligence, to shut down free speech.
[00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:25.833]  So they're making the internet a human-free zone more and more.
[00:51:25.893 --> 00:51:29.537]  If you don't go along with what the machine minders want, they censor you.
[00:51:29.577 --> 00:51:32.980]  Imagine a science fiction book by Isaac Asimov where that's happening.
[00:51:35.062 --> 00:51:37.044]  Oh, the public would never put up with that iRobot.
[00:51:38.032 --> 00:51:39.553]  But they will here in the real world.
[00:51:40.373 --> 00:51:42.715]  So, what did they say was the fake news?
[00:51:43.495 --> 00:51:46.357]  Imam, I warned de Blasio about New York City terror.
[00:51:46.717 --> 00:51:48.378]  He was too busy bashing Trump.
[00:51:50.059 --> 00:51:55.562]  The Imam, want to get on, Mohamed Tawahidi, has been all over Fox, all over everywhere, all over talk radio.
[00:51:55.822 --> 00:51:58.083]  He's gone and spoken to de Blasio on television.
[00:51:58.364 --> 00:51:58.984]  He's warned him.
[00:51:59.024 --> 00:52:00.004]  He's had demonstrations.
[00:52:00.405 --> 00:52:02.266]  He's gone and shown the mosque that would do it.
[00:52:02.506 --> 00:52:06.028]  We have the videos and the tweets in the article by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:52:07.259 --> 00:52:11.601]  Let's put that on screen please and for TV viewers so we can scroll through it.
[00:52:12.041 --> 00:52:20.644]  So this is a well-known guy that's all over television, very credible, been part of BBC documentaries, you name it.
[00:52:20.724 --> 00:52:25.466]  It's what he does is he goes around the mosque and he identifies who's calling for violence and he tells the police.
[00:52:26.226 --> 00:52:27.086]  And then of course he was right.
[00:52:27.307 --> 00:52:30.888]  Turned out ISIS a month before was taking photos, the very guy, of what he was planning.
[00:52:31.168 --> 00:52:33.729]  He brought 28 members of his family in, on and on and on.
[00:52:34.969 --> 00:52:36.190]  How do they respond?
[00:52:37.321 --> 00:52:54.455]  They say we're fake news, need to be shut down, and then use this as an example of fake news when all we did was report on a public figure who's on record traveling to London, England, New York, New York, Australia, you name it, showing the mosque for a decade
[00:52:56.038 --> 00:52:59.359]  And he's been on TV warning de Blasio, you have terrorists in New York.
[00:52:59.699 --> 00:53:01.019]  Months ago, it was on Fox News.
[00:53:01.319 --> 00:53:04.060]  He's been on Sean Hannity, saying they're going to attack with trucks.
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:04.500]  It's coming.
[00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:05.280]  We've said that.
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:06.920]  It happens.
[00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:11.161]  It's the very visa program that Trump's killed that brought him in.
[00:53:11.361 --> 00:53:12.301]  We're proven right.
[00:53:12.641 --> 00:53:20.743]  And in their alchemy, they have the tech heads up there admitting that they're trying to censor us, defaming us and saying we're fake news.
[00:53:21.183 --> 00:53:23.844]  But then a congressman comes back, a Republican congressman.
[00:53:24.938 --> 00:53:30.783]  Didn't know who this guy was very well, but I love him now, and says, wait a minute, this article you mentioned, they're just reporting on somebody's tweets.
[00:53:32.023 --> 00:53:33.104]  How is that fake news?
[00:53:33.244 --> 00:53:36.407]  And they can't say, and he goes, yeah, you can't say, because it's not.
[00:53:36.427 --> 00:53:44.273]  Because that congressman's going, wait, I've seen this email on TV, warning New York, and warning the Chicago, and warning Deerfield, Michigan.
[00:53:44.833 --> 00:53:46.735]  They're like, wait a minute, we've all heard this guy warn everybody.
[00:53:46.775 --> 00:53:48.676]  Well, Infowars is real.
[00:53:50.057 --> 00:53:50.858]  Infowars is
[00:53:53.072 --> 00:53:54.472]  Next year's news today!
[00:53:54.832 --> 00:53:55.673]  That's why we're hated.
[00:53:56.013 --> 00:53:57.233]  So let's start getting to these clips.
[00:53:58.253 --> 00:54:01.174]  Let's go to the first clip here of Piggly Wiggly.
[00:54:01.534 --> 00:54:03.415]  Lawmaker demands Twitter censor InfoWars.
[00:54:03.775 --> 00:54:05.275]  Here's Congressman Mike Quigley.
[00:54:05.295 --> 00:54:05.655]  Here it is.
[00:54:06.576 --> 00:54:10.297]  Let's look at unpaid content for a second.
[00:54:11.577 --> 00:54:15.278]  Sometimes these fake accounts are pulled down, but the fake story
[00:54:16.917 --> 00:54:26.846]  Takes the false claims of widespread voter fraud, for example, generated by these accounts, have spread thousands and thousands of times, often picked up by legitimate news accounts.
[00:54:27.026 --> 00:54:32.851]  And Harvard just confirmed... More illegals voted than he even said.
[00:54:32.891 --> 00:54:39.157]  Let me just note this, that if we're asking, are we still in this situation?
[00:54:41.423 --> 00:55:06.822]  As of just a short time ago, and I'm talking about when this meeting started, on Twitter, if you clicked on the hashtag, NYC terrorist attack, which is quote, trending, marked with a red button saying, quote, live, the top tweet links to an InfoWars story with the headline, Imam, I warned de Blasio about New York City terror, he was too busy bashing Trump.
[00:55:09.121 --> 00:55:16.406]  This is a real-time example of when we talk about this information being weaponized.
[00:55:16.446 --> 00:55:17.607]  Look at the feigned concern.
[00:55:17.627 --> 00:55:33.516]  How quickly can you act and what's your responsibility to set the record straight so that the people who saw this know that it's fake news and at least at some point in time it can't keep spreading like some sort of virus through legitimate world.
[00:55:33.536 --> 00:55:33.917]  A virus.
[00:55:35.229 --> 00:55:41.473]  That's something we're thinking about all the time because it's a bad user experience and we don't want to be known as a platform for that.
[00:55:41.613 --> 00:55:55.521]  In your example, for instance... This code just says we're fake when we're linked to news articles and tweets and videos of the Imam on Fox all over.
[00:55:55.541 --> 00:56:01.985]  Everybody knows who he is saying, watch out, they got terrorists getting ready to hit New York with cars.
[00:56:03.018 --> 00:56:17.475]  And then we're proving right, and then he just goes to Twitter, Google, and Facebook, and they go, oh, don't worry, we're trying to shut him down, and next they say we're going to use AI to do it, then we have to go to break, we're going to come back, and then I'm going to play the other congressman, the Republican, going, this story's real!
[00:56:18.116 --> 00:56:19.277]  Everybody knows about this!
[00:56:19.598 --> 00:56:22.080]  So, again, they're trying to pull a fast one here.
[00:56:22.781 --> 00:56:23.062]  Here it is.
[00:56:24.585 --> 00:56:26.526]  For instance, the system self-corrected.
[00:56:26.646 --> 00:56:29.508]  That shouldn't be the first tweet you see anymore.
[00:56:29.528 --> 00:56:31.769]  It should be a USA article the last time I checked.
[00:56:31.789 --> 00:56:32.429]  Okay, pause again.
[00:56:32.489 --> 00:56:32.930]  Sorry, sorry.
[00:56:33.170 --> 00:56:33.990]  This is so phenomenal.
[00:56:34.451 --> 00:56:35.191]  Back it up ten seconds.
[00:56:35.651 --> 00:56:37.292]  The system self-corrected.
[00:56:37.332 --> 00:56:37.572]  Yeah.
[00:56:37.832 --> 00:56:39.834]  We're number one because we're the most interesting.
[00:56:39.854 --> 00:56:40.494]  We tell the truth.
[00:56:40.734 --> 00:56:41.795]  They whack us down.
[00:56:42.875 --> 00:56:44.236]  The system self-corrected.
[00:56:44.496 --> 00:56:46.697]  So next you'll see a USA Today article.
[00:56:47.398 --> 00:56:47.538]  See?
[00:56:48.817 --> 00:56:51.178]  We'll force-feed you mainstream, Congress.
[00:56:51.758 --> 00:56:52.938]  We'll censor real quick.
[00:56:53.138 --> 00:56:59.059]  We won't let you know that de Blasio has parades for jihadists that make funding for bombing Israel.
[00:56:59.119 --> 00:57:01.080]  I mean, you can't make this up!
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:01.940]  Let's continue.
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:05.541]  What you see anymore should be a USA article the last time I checked.
[00:57:06.721 --> 00:57:07.542]  But you saw this?
[00:57:07.722 --> 00:57:08.482]  USA Today.
[00:57:08.882 --> 00:57:09.702]  At lunch I did, yeah.
[00:57:09.742 --> 00:57:12.503]  And I also saw the system correct it.
[00:57:13.523 --> 00:57:17.484]  Can you give me a really good guess on how long it was top?
[00:57:19.373 --> 00:57:22.997]  We can follow up with you and your staff on that, and I don't have the stat in front of me.
[00:57:23.017 --> 00:57:24.218]  They're all colluding!
[00:57:24.238 --> 00:57:24.638]  So I don't know.
[00:57:24.798 --> 00:57:25.519]  In the censorship.
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:26.820]  Hit pause.
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:30.864]  I'm going to come back where they talk about, sir, we need computers to watch him in real time.
[00:57:30.904 --> 00:57:32.125]  We will stop Alex Jones.
[00:57:32.406 --> 00:57:33.547]  He's like, good, good.
[00:57:34.187 --> 00:57:36.309]  And then the other congressman goes, this is very dangerous.
[00:57:36.329 --> 00:57:37.530]  You guys have weaponized this.
[00:57:38.291 --> 00:57:40.814]  Everybody knows de Blasio's coddling jihadis.
[00:57:42.475 --> 00:57:50.341]  They're all admitting that they're involved in racketeering against the First Amendment in Congress in real time trying to stop us!
[00:57:52.703 --> 00:57:53.864]  Take a look at this study.
[00:57:54.344 --> 00:57:58.407]  Prenatal pollution exposure linked to decreased telomere length.
[00:57:58.747 --> 00:58:01.509]  Telomeres is something you may have heard of recently.
[00:58:01.529 --> 00:58:07.154]  It is what is at the end of your DNA that is responsible for the aging process.
[00:58:07.174 --> 00:58:07.614]  This is a
[00:58:07.654 --> 00:58:10.015]  Very important part of our human chemistry.
[00:58:10.255 --> 00:58:16.838]  So you already know that we live in an environment that is just loaded with toxic chemicals.
[00:58:17.298 --> 00:58:25.742]  Now they're finding that that environment is actually affecting babies in the prenatal stage, specifically when it comes to the telomeres.
[00:58:26.042 --> 00:58:30.624]  So now you have babies prematurely aging because of all the toxins.
[00:58:31.064 --> 00:58:32.565]  So what does InfoWars do, folks?
[00:58:32.886 --> 00:58:46.417]  We find a solution, and we offer you the best, most groundbreaking product to deal with protecting and keeping your telomeres healthy, and that is DNA Force at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:46.657 --> 00:58:48.498]  And right now, DNA Force is 25% off, folks.
[00:58:52.241 --> 00:58:53.162]  25% off.
[00:58:53.402 --> 00:59:04.230]  We see the study that tells you your telomeres are under attack and we cut the price because we care about you and we want you to be fully healthy and aware to fight the new world order.
[00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:10.194]  So go to Infowarsstore.com, take advantage of DNA Force, protect your telomeres.
[00:59:10.494 --> 00:59:18.039]  Look at the science behind DNA Force for yourself and you will see why this product is groundbreaking for telomere protection.
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:28.590]  InfowarStore.com You've got to have the will to accept the truth and buck the system and the group collective.
[00:59:29.691 --> 00:59:33.375]  Do that, and you'll earn your way to the next level.
[00:59:34.777 --> 00:59:35.878]  This is the Infowar.
[00:59:54.952 --> 00:59:59.056]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:59.577 --> 01:00:00.938]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:04.662 --> 01:00:09.567]  In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.
[01:00:10.328 --> 01:00:11.890]  Government is the problem.
[01:00:12.802 --> 01:00:19.043]  From time to time, we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule.
[01:00:19.583 --> 01:00:25.944]  That government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people.
[01:00:29.585 --> 01:00:32.886]  If you've been successful, you didn't get there on your own.
[01:00:38.567 --> 01:00:40.827]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:44.082]  Somebody else made that happen.
[01:00:45.003 --> 01:00:54.671]  You've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems.
[01:00:55.832 --> 01:00:58.494]  They'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner.
[01:00:59.315 --> 01:01:00.396]  You should reject these voices.
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:17.787]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set.
[01:01:18.608 --> 01:01:25.634]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:01:28.677 --> 01:01:30.379]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:01:30.819 --> 01:01:33.582]  Because there is a war on, or you're mine.
[01:01:40.205 --> 01:01:48.173]  So, they have the heads of operations for Google, Twitter, and Facebook in the House Intelligence Committee last week.
[01:01:50.435 --> 01:01:57.062]  And Congressman Wigley says InfoWorks puts out fake news about election theft.
[01:01:57.563 --> 01:02:00.666]  They're now admitting that Hillary stole the nomination from Sanders.
[01:02:01.787 --> 01:02:02.508]  Something we broke.
[01:02:04.175 --> 01:02:10.402]  They're now admitting 5.7 million illegals voted, not the 3.3 like Trump was saying.
[01:02:10.663 --> 01:02:11.644]  Harvard now is confirmed.
[01:02:11.964 --> 01:02:20.735]  But then they go into saying that de Blasio hasn't been coddling terrorists or that Imams didn't warn de Blasio the attack was coming.
[01:02:22.932 --> 01:02:25.855]  And you've got the tech heads saying, we want you to have a good user experience.
[01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:26.876]  That's what we're going to censor.
[01:02:27.236 --> 01:02:28.738]  They don't even say we're fake.
[01:02:28.938 --> 01:02:33.362]  They just say, oh, we want you to have a good experience and live in a cult and live in La La Land.
[01:02:33.402 --> 01:02:37.586]  And later they say, we're working on AI to just automate and shut down InfoWars.
[01:02:37.806 --> 01:02:38.127]  Here it is.
[01:02:39.383 --> 01:02:43.627]  Shouldn't be the first tweet you see anymore, it should be a USA article the last time I checked.
[01:02:44.828 --> 01:02:45.629]  But you saw this?
[01:02:45.809 --> 01:02:46.570]  USA Today.
[01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:47.791]  At lunch I did, yeah.
[01:02:47.851 --> 01:02:50.614]  And I also saw the system correct it.
[01:02:51.615 --> 01:02:55.579]  Can you give me a really good guess on how long it was top?
[01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:02.745]  We can follow up with you and your staff on that, and I don't have the stat in front of me, so I don't know.
[01:03:03.145 --> 01:03:12.795]  But we're, like we said earlier, trying to balance, you know, free speech with making the information you see on the system, especially around trends that we direct.
[01:03:14.755 --> 01:03:15.836]  Trends that they direct.
[01:03:15.896 --> 01:03:19.658]  Now let's go to the Republican Congressman Chris Stewart of Utah.
[01:03:20.318 --> 01:03:22.539]  Came to the defense of Infowars and free speech.
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:23.280]  Here it is.
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:25.441]  We have used the term fake news.
[01:03:26.522 --> 01:03:28.423]  It's been used pervasively in this hearing.
[01:03:30.044 --> 01:03:33.626]  And we all recognize that fake news is in the eye of the beholder many times.
[01:03:33.706 --> 01:03:36.808]  There are some things that are reported that are demonstrably untrue.
[01:03:37.828 --> 01:03:42.292]  But the vast majority of it is some spectrum there of opinion and reality.
[01:03:42.632 --> 01:03:44.314]  And I'll use Mr. Quigley's example.
[01:03:44.354 --> 01:03:52.080]  He said, for example, and as I best recall, Amman warns de Blasio he ignored it because he was too busy criticizing Trump.
[01:03:52.481 --> 01:03:53.842]  Well, there's an element of both in there.
[01:03:53.902 --> 01:03:55.884]  Perhaps Amman did warn de Blasio.
[01:03:55.904 --> 01:03:56.784]  We don't know that yet.
[01:03:56.884 --> 01:03:57.905]  He did.
[01:03:58.145 --> 01:04:02.029]  And whether he was too busy criticizing Trump, to some degree, is a matter of opinion.
[01:04:02.734 --> 01:04:07.597]  Now to my friend Mr. Quigley, and I don't mean this as a criticism, I mean to him, that's fake news.
[01:04:08.237 --> 01:04:11.719]  Someone else read that and they see legitimate critique in there.
[01:04:12.239 --> 01:04:20.584]  How in the world do you intend to identify fake news without weaponizing this in the political realm?
[01:04:20.884 --> 01:04:26.387]  Because as I said, there is an enormous degree of opinion included in almost every bit of that.
[01:04:26.827 --> 01:04:31.250]  And if you're viewed as being political in this, and it's my fear that you will be, regardless of what you do,
[01:04:32.050 --> 01:04:35.132]  If you're viewed as being political, then it's not monitoring fake news.
[01:04:35.232 --> 01:04:37.513]  It's weaponizing it, and it's editorializing it.
[01:04:37.853 --> 01:04:40.355]  And the best example of that is simply the fact-checking.
[01:04:40.755 --> 01:04:46.658]  Fact-checking is as opinionated many times as anything else that we see.
[01:04:47.039 --> 01:04:48.299]  And I've got 24 seconds.
[01:04:48.319 --> 01:04:50.901]  You can't answer that, so I'm going to express my fear of it.
[01:04:51.881 --> 01:04:55.984]  But if you have a very quick response, I'd be interested in what that might be.
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:00.681]  I don't blame you for remaining silent.
[01:05:00.701 --> 01:05:01.962]  We're gonna come back with that.
[01:05:07.548 --> 01:05:11.832]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[01:05:14.793 --> 01:05:19.376]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[01:05:19.396 --> 01:05:34.104]  Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up,
[01:05:38.626 --> 01:05:39.187]  I think so.
[01:06:09.139 --> 01:06:12.820]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:19.782]  Because there is a war on, or you're mine.
[01:06:20.602 --> 01:06:29.105]  So, last week they had the House Intelligence Committee hearings, where the tech giants even had to admit that actually the Russian bots
[01:06:31.288 --> 01:06:36.612]  We're in a bunch of different companies, and a lot of them were leftist groups that were actually anti-Trump.
[01:06:37.193 --> 01:06:42.517]  The others were neutral and were only trying to get traffic to their news stories.
[01:06:43.358 --> 01:06:44.779]  They were just inflammatory.
[01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:52.105]  And they were less than 1% of the entire aggregate of traffic during the election.
[01:06:53.846 --> 01:06:58.210]  But then I learned yesterday that during the hearings, there was a story on Infowars.com
[01:07:01.144 --> 01:07:20.609]  They came out and said that we made up a fake news story that a prominent Imam had warned de Blasio that radical Islamists in ISIS were planning truck attacks.
[01:07:20.629 --> 01:07:22.710]  Well, ISIS put out videos a year ago.
[01:07:22.730 --> 01:07:23.750]  They've been doing it all over the world.
[01:07:24.370 --> 01:07:26.090]  And there's the article they say is fake news.
[01:07:26.691 --> 01:07:27.751]  I warned de Blasio
[01:07:29.474 --> 01:07:33.716]  About New York City terror, but he was too busy bashing Trump.
[01:07:35.276 --> 01:07:40.558]  They have the heads of the tech companies on, and they say, sir, yeah, we're working on censoring InfoWars.
[01:07:40.838 --> 01:07:42.039]  We saw that fake story.
[01:07:42.419 --> 01:07:44.900]  We had our artificial, you know, computer system shut it down.
[01:07:47.801 --> 01:07:48.781]  And you can go watch the whole hearing.
[01:07:48.821 --> 01:07:50.922]  They talk about AI and the future, controlling it.
[01:07:51.983 --> 01:07:53.063]  Here's the story video.
[01:07:53.103 --> 01:07:55.024]  Dem lawmaker demands Twitter censor InfoWars.
[01:07:56.035 --> 01:07:59.376]  But then the Republican, I'm going to play this clip and go to our guests, it all ties together.
[01:08:00.977 --> 01:08:06.019]  Chris Stewart of Utah says, well that's opinion on whether or not this imam warned him.
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:08.160]  That's not fake news.
[01:08:09.441 --> 01:08:11.722]  But it's not even that, that this imam is famous.
[01:08:11.742 --> 01:08:12.802]  He's been all over Fox News.
[01:08:14.443 --> 01:08:15.903]  We've already covered that in detail.
[01:08:16.624 --> 01:08:19.345]  Warning that this attack was coming.
[01:08:21.098 --> 01:08:22.919]  Imam Muhammad Tawahidi.
[01:08:22.959 --> 01:08:23.539]  He's famous.
[01:08:23.879 --> 01:08:24.780]  He goes to the mosque.
[01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:26.720]  He gives examples of what are being preached.
[01:08:27.341 --> 01:08:30.482]  Of course everybody said truck attacks are coming to NYC.
[01:08:30.542 --> 01:08:37.005]  Look at what's happening in Paris and Nice and Israel and Russia.
[01:08:37.105 --> 01:08:46.649]  I mean, they call it fake news to say we're letting people in that are going to attack us when this guy was let in by Obama on one of these visa programs that Trump's trying to kill?
[01:08:47.309 --> 01:08:48.690]  And they call that fake news?
[01:08:51.397 --> 01:08:51.878]  Incredible!
[01:08:52.098 --> 01:08:54.763]  So, again, here's the clip of the congressman, then we're going to go to our guest.
[01:08:55.745 --> 01:09:00.313]  And this all ties into the war on Trump, the war on America that's so desperate by the deep state.
[01:09:00.334 --> 01:09:02.978]  But here is the congressman checking their propaganda.
[01:09:03.655 --> 01:09:05.236]  You've used the term fake news.
[01:09:06.336 --> 01:09:08.257]  It's been used pervasively in this hearing.
[01:09:09.857 --> 01:09:13.439]  And we all recognize that fake news is in the eye of the beholder many times.
[01:09:13.539 --> 01:09:16.640]  There are some things that are reported that are demonstrably untrue.
[01:09:17.641 --> 01:09:22.102]  But the vast majority of it is some spectrum there of opinion and reality.
[01:09:22.442 --> 01:09:24.123]  And I'll use Mr. Quigley's example.
[01:09:24.183 --> 01:09:28.385]  He said, for example, and as I best recall, Amman warns de Blasio
[01:09:29.125 --> 01:09:31.869]  He ignored it because he was too busy criticizing Trump.
[01:09:32.290 --> 01:09:33.672]  Well, there's an element of both in there.
[01:09:33.712 --> 01:09:35.675]  Perhaps Iman did warn de Blasio.
[01:09:35.715 --> 01:09:36.597]  We don't know that yet.
[01:09:37.959 --> 01:09:41.845]  And whether he was too busy criticizing Trump, to some degree, is a matter of opinion.
[01:09:42.546 --> 01:09:47.410]  Now to my friend Mr. Quigley, and I don't mean this as a criticism, I mean to him, that's fake news.
[01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:51.553]  Someone else read that and they see legitimate critique in there.
[01:09:52.053 --> 01:10:00.400]  How in the world do you intend to identify fake news without weaponizing this in the political realm?
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:06.204]  Because as I said, there is an enormous degree of opinion included in almost every bit of that.
[01:10:06.644 --> 01:10:11.068]  And if you're viewed as being political in this, and it's my fear that you will be, regardless of what you do.
[01:10:11.288 --> 01:10:11.708]  And they are.
[01:10:11.868 --> 01:10:17.313]  If you're viewed as being political, then it's not monitoring fake news, it's weaponizing it, and it's editorializing it.
[01:10:17.673 --> 01:10:20.175]  And the best example of that is simply the fact-checking.
[01:10:20.575 --> 01:10:26.480]  Fact-checking is as opinionated many times as anything else that we see.
[01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:28.121]  And I've got 24 seconds.
[01:10:28.141 --> 01:10:29.062]  You can't answer that.
[01:10:29.122 --> 01:10:30.723]  So I'm going to express my fear of it.
[01:10:31.704 --> 01:10:35.807]  But if you have a very quick response, I'd be interested in what that might be.
[01:10:39.375 --> 01:10:41.037]  I don't blame you for remaining silent.
[01:10:41.418 --> 01:10:44.201]  You understand, though, why we're concerned about that and the challenge.
[01:10:44.281 --> 01:10:45.522]  And we want to help you on that.
[01:10:46.223 --> 01:10:48.466]  But we live in a political world already.
[01:10:48.506 --> 01:10:49.888]  I hope we make it less political.
[01:10:51.109 --> 01:10:52.090]  They need to be busted up.
[01:10:52.110 --> 01:10:52.951]  They're antitrust.
[01:10:52.971 --> 01:10:55.194]  Like, Keith Olbermann threatened to attack and kill everybody.
[01:10:55.214 --> 01:10:59.319]  But if you call somebody a liar, they shut you down if you're a conservative, a Christian, a libertarian.
[01:11:00.455 --> 01:11:04.416]  Joining us is Edward Klein, a distinguished journalist, a best-selling author.
[01:11:04.436 --> 01:11:08.457]  I'm not going to go over his whole background with New York Daily News and you name it.
[01:11:09.718 --> 01:11:11.618]  He's of course been with the Times as well.
[01:11:11.678 --> 01:11:14.819]  He's written many articles for Vanity Fair, a lot of other publications.
[01:11:15.259 --> 01:11:16.940]  EdwardKlein.com is his website.
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:20.401]  He's got the new book out, All Out War, The Plot to Destroy Trump.
[01:11:21.081 --> 01:11:21.862]  And that's what it is.
[01:11:21.942 --> 01:11:23.103]  It's All Out War.
[01:11:23.183 --> 01:11:26.407]  I've never seen such deception, such viciousness.
[01:11:26.887 --> 01:11:31.793]  And it's only getting more insane as it appears they're going to lose.
[01:11:31.833 --> 01:11:33.134]  But that's the perfect title.
[01:11:33.174 --> 01:11:33.615]  It's true.
[01:11:33.975 --> 01:11:35.337]  How is this All Out War?
[01:11:35.897 --> 01:11:37.139]  And where does it end?
[01:11:37.179 --> 01:11:39.882]  Number one New York Times bestselling author, Ed Klein.
[01:11:41.187 --> 01:11:44.368]  Alex, it all began on a specific date.
[01:11:44.728 --> 01:11:46.909]  We can actually put a date on it.
[01:11:47.009 --> 01:11:47.549]  December 16, 2016.
[01:11:47.689 --> 01:12:04.214]  Six weeks after Donald Trump won the election, Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, and their consigliere, Valerie Jarrett, invite Susan Rice, the National Security Advisor, to dinner in the White House.
[01:12:04.674 --> 01:12:08.555]  And Susan Rice convinces the President, Obama at that time,
[01:12:09.451 --> 01:12:28.449]  To unmask the names of Donald Trump associates who were inadvertently picked up in NSA intercepts, unmask their names so they became public, distribute them widely through the intelligence community among hundreds if not thousands of people, and make sure they're leaked to the press.
[01:12:28.925 --> 01:12:39.356]  And that's where this cockamamie story, this false narrative, as they call it, of collusion began, right in the Obama White House.
[01:12:40.566 --> 01:12:44.047]  And now, it's thousands of times the size of Watergate.
[01:12:44.307 --> 01:12:46.387]  They've all lied to Congress, they've lied to the people.
[01:12:47.207 --> 01:12:47.948]  It's illegal.
[01:12:48.708 --> 01:12:51.128]  We found out the Democrats are up in their eyeballs with the Russians.
[01:12:51.688 --> 01:12:53.549]  Everything they said Trump did, they've done.
[01:12:53.569 --> 01:12:56.009]  The only guy that's not in bed with the Russians is Trump.
[01:12:57.169 --> 01:12:59.790]  No wonder they're fighting so hard, because they're fighting for their lives.
[01:13:00.990 --> 01:13:02.551]  Well, they are fighting for their lives.
[01:13:03.011 --> 01:13:09.752]  And, you know, we have in this new book that I've written, All Out War, an FBI report
[01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:37.374]  That confirms what I think you and a lot of other people have been saying for quite a while, which is that there is a deep state and that these rogue elements inside the permanent bureaucracy of the government are doing everything they can to sabotage Donald Trump's agenda and the agenda, in my view, of the American people, that these deep state people, these permanent
[01:13:38.403 --> 01:13:58.407]  Employees who, aside with Clinton and Obama, are deleting files from computers, losing files, slow-walking regulations and leaking to the press and doing everything they can to undo this effort on the part of the president to make America great again.
[01:14:01.584 --> 01:14:02.504]  What's their next move?
[01:14:02.524 --> 01:14:03.885]  I mean, it appears they're losing.
[01:14:04.505 --> 01:14:15.870]  It appears that Robert Mueller's the one that ought to be indicted for Russia ties with handing uranium off on tarmacs to the FSB, Hillary getting all this money.
[01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:17.710]  This is beyond any Tom Clancy novel.
[01:14:18.711 --> 01:14:19.351]  It really is.
[01:14:19.391 --> 01:14:21.372]  You can't make this stuff up, as you just said.
[01:14:21.832 --> 01:14:29.595]  Well, you know, one of the things in this new book, All Out War, the plot to destroy Trump that I have put into the book,
[01:14:30.390 --> 01:14:34.932]  I've reproduced not one, but two secret FBI reports.
[01:14:35.573 --> 01:14:51.421]  One on the deep state, which we've just talked about, and another on the connection between the radical left wing of violent groups like Antifa and others that are spread throughout college communities in the United States.
[01:14:51.961 --> 01:14:58.304]  The connection between these left wing groups, violent left wing groups, and the Islamic State and Al Qaeda.
[01:14:58.755 --> 01:15:19.326]  And FBI agents went to Europe and actually infiltrated and watched and recorded these meetings that took place in Europe and in Syria between these Americans who are getting instructions on how to make bombs, how to deal with toxic chemicals, use toxic chemicals as weapons, the very scary stuff.
[01:15:19.506 --> 01:15:25.790]  And the FBI says in the secret report that I printed, this is the greatest challenge
[01:15:26.383 --> 01:15:30.038]  To law enforcement since the 1970s and the weather underground.
[01:15:31.451 --> 01:15:32.152]  I totally agree.
[01:15:32.192 --> 01:15:37.456]  I can't wait to read the book because just reading the synopsis, I've learned some things and then gone and looked them up and they were actually true.
[01:15:37.676 --> 01:15:42.479]  I didn't even know that there's documents where the left even sees ISIS as their army.
[01:15:42.539 --> 01:15:46.022]  But I guess if you watch the news, they see radical Islam as their army.
[01:15:46.482 --> 01:15:52.547]  And it just shows that they've radicalized to the point of being unrecognizable from the Democratic Party of just 10 years ago.
[01:15:52.907 --> 01:15:57.651]  I want to ask you where you think all this is going and some of the other big secrets that are in your book.
[01:15:58.391 --> 01:16:01.954]  It's Edward Klein, edwardklein.com, all out war, the plot to destroy Trump.
[01:16:02.575 --> 01:16:06.899]  We're very proud of the fact here at InfoWars that we're a teleprompter-free operation.
[01:16:07.379 --> 01:16:12.424]  We don't get our talking points from the private Federal Reserve or from Nazi collaborators like George Soros.
[01:16:12.964 --> 01:16:16.888]  We get our talking points from common sense and research from we the people.
[01:16:16.908 --> 01:16:20.210]  That means our guests, our researchers, you the listeners, the callers.
[01:16:20.871 --> 01:16:25.313]  But that said, today I've got a script I'm going to follow for the first time ever.
[01:16:25.953 --> 01:16:29.235]  It's you, the listeners, the viewers, that wrote my talking points.
[01:16:29.915 --> 01:16:37.619]  I came in here an hour ago and I literally just went to InfoWarsTore.com and printed the five-star reviews.
[01:16:38.559 --> 01:16:39.420]  The first few pages.
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:43.545]  These are in the order of how they've been posted by you, the listeners.
[01:16:44.125 --> 01:16:47.609]  And it's five-star after five-star after five-star.
[01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:49.672]  It's amazing from third-party sites.
[01:16:50.112 --> 01:16:56.439]  So, this is what you, the listeners and viewers, have to say about the products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:16:56.499 --> 01:16:57.401]  Let's go over them right now.
[01:16:57.921 --> 01:16:59.442]  This is verified by our Mark.
[01:16:59.622 --> 01:17:02.583]  Five-star review for Anthroplex for men and women.
[01:17:03.063 --> 01:17:04.103]  I take it as directed.
[01:17:04.123 --> 01:17:15.007]  As one uses it too much, it will cause reflections of adolescent years and skin and muscle and hair growth will of course increase sex drive as a given.
[01:17:15.567 --> 01:17:16.248]  Easy does it.
[01:17:16.328 --> 01:17:17.348]  Yeah, it's hardcore.
[01:17:17.368 --> 01:17:18.308]  It's very, very serious.
[01:17:18.729 --> 01:17:19.149]  Not a game.
[01:17:19.169 --> 01:17:19.569]  Thank you, Mark.
[01:17:20.109 --> 01:17:21.370]  Here's another one from Patrick.
[01:17:21.510 --> 01:17:22.291]  Energy all day.
[01:17:22.311 --> 01:17:30.038]  I use this along with Supermail and it makes me have driving energy all day on my 12 to 14 hour day.
[01:17:30.478 --> 01:17:31.199]  Another review.
[01:17:31.219 --> 01:17:32.200]  I love this one.
[01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:34.942]  Keeps my husband going and going and going.
[01:17:35.323 --> 01:17:38.846]  This must be the stuff the Energizer Bunny is on.
[01:17:39.126 --> 01:17:42.049]  I guess that's some fine lady using her husband Adam's account.
[01:17:42.429 --> 01:17:43.971]  Here's another one ladies and gentlemen.
[01:17:44.352 --> 01:17:47.716]  Five star review for Winter Sun Vitamin D3.
[01:17:47.996 --> 01:17:51.180]  This product is amazing and will keep you from the winter blues.
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:55.966]  I don't get sick last winter while I was taking this for the first time in my life.
[01:17:56.106 --> 01:17:57.087]  Amazing product.
[01:17:57.808 --> 01:17:59.890]  Again, tastes good as well, they say.
[01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:01.310]  Here's one from Brian.
[01:18:01.631 --> 01:18:03.712]  I love this product and I live in Wisconsin.
[01:18:03.832 --> 01:18:04.673]  Thank you all.
[01:18:05.073 --> 01:18:08.715]  It's time that we turn the clocks back and lose the sunshine.
[01:18:08.775 --> 01:18:10.997]  I love this product and I am a night owl.
[01:18:11.397 --> 01:18:13.338]  Every night owl should have this product.
[01:18:13.839 --> 01:18:17.281]  I will buy this product as soon as possible again.
[01:18:17.541 --> 01:18:18.182]  And I should add,
[01:18:18.982 --> 01:18:20.103]  That's a great name for this product.
[01:18:20.363 --> 01:18:22.204]  Not just for the winter, but for night owls as well.
[01:18:22.224 --> 01:18:23.944]  In fact, it should probably be called Night Owl.
[01:18:24.265 --> 01:18:25.605]  Night Owl's Winter Sun.
[01:18:25.685 --> 01:18:27.286]  Or, Night Owls Get Sun in the Winter.
[01:18:27.326 --> 01:18:27.886]  Okay, I'm going to stop.
[01:18:28.127 --> 01:18:28.887]  I said I'd shut up!
[01:18:29.807 --> 01:18:30.568]  But back to the script.
[01:18:30.928 --> 01:18:32.789]  Liquid Sunshine is what they call it.
[01:18:32.829 --> 01:18:33.549]  I love that name too.
[01:18:34.009 --> 01:18:36.030]  I will be using this product for two years now.
[01:18:36.331 --> 01:18:40.533]  It's wonderful out in the Pacific Northwest to get this Liquid Sunshine.
[01:18:40.573 --> 01:18:43.134]  Patrick, thank you for the support and for the review.
[01:18:43.194 --> 01:18:44.615]  You make it literally possible.
[01:18:45.675 --> 01:18:50.500]  Continuing with Silver Bullet, the highest quality, 30 parts per million colloidal silver out there.
[01:18:51.021 --> 01:18:53.844]  Dale, should be called Magic Bullet.
[01:18:53.984 --> 01:18:57.688]  Oh my gosh, the listeners are so much smarter than me and I'm not being patronizing.
[01:18:58.209 --> 01:19:00.772]  I've been, that's what a Silver Bullet's supposed to be though, kinda, so.
[01:19:01.412 --> 01:19:03.914]  I've been using Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver for years now.
[01:19:04.254 --> 01:19:06.376]  This was the first product I purchased from InfoWare Store.
[01:19:06.696 --> 01:19:12.560]  Whenever I feel the first hazes of cold or sore throat coming on, a dose of Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has always ended it before it starts.
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:18.744]  I've been giving it away for family and Christmas and birthdays since 2015 and it's worked for everyone.
[01:19:19.204 --> 01:19:25.608]  It has become an expected gift for our family and that's why we get you the best products because we want the repeat customers.
[01:19:25.869 --> 01:19:26.669]  It's all a win-win.
[01:19:26.849 --> 01:19:27.730]  That's an awesome review.
[01:19:27.790 --> 01:19:30.972]  Thank you, Dale, for your support and for what you've done for your family as well.
[01:19:31.032 --> 01:19:33.053]  Well, we've only got 20 seconds left, folks.
[01:19:33.113 --> 01:19:36.076]  I can't get to all the other Silver Bullet reviews, the Cayman reviews.
[01:19:36.096 --> 01:19:37.276]  They're all five-star.
[01:19:37.517 --> 01:19:43.461]  They talk about the meal replacement, how great it is, how it blows them away post-workout, pre-workout.
[01:19:43.521 --> 01:19:46.803]  Taste, you know, okay, they say, but it's the results that really matter.
[01:19:47.103 --> 01:19:48.905]  Best post-workout ever is what Andrew says.
[01:19:49.205 --> 01:19:52.727]  Find it all, folks, at InfoWarsTore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:19:52.747 --> 01:19:57.871]  You can't lose because you're funding the second American Revolution, and I salute you all!
[01:20:06.030 --> 01:20:08.731]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:17.035 --> 01:20:19.976]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:20:20.916 --> 01:20:26.439]  One more segment and then I'm going to open the phones up after our guest leaves us for the callers and cover a bunch of other news that's unfolding.
[01:20:27.539 --> 01:20:29.520]  All out war, the plot to destroy Trump.
[01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:34.305]  Ed Klein's new book is set to be a bestseller, undoubtedly.
[01:20:34.325 --> 01:20:36.888]  You know, Stephen Bannon understands it's total war.
[01:20:37.068 --> 01:20:38.310]  I point out it's an info war.
[01:20:38.910 --> 01:20:46.720]  But I can't go out on the streets now in San Francisco or Austin or Seattle without people running up throwing coffee at me.
[01:20:47.381 --> 01:20:47.721]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:21:03.450 --> 01:21:05.113]  They go, oh no we're not, that's fake news.
[01:21:05.153 --> 01:21:07.095]  So there's been a total radicalization.
[01:21:07.636 --> 01:21:11.261]  Why do you have the term all-out war and flesh out what's in the book?
[01:21:11.341 --> 01:21:13.084]  Because people may think they know it all, they don't.
[01:21:13.384 --> 01:21:17.090]  This is something everybody needs to read and understand because people have to know what they're in.
[01:21:17.130 --> 01:21:19.473]  If you're just a normal conservative or Christian...
[01:21:20.214 --> 01:21:21.095]  Or libertarian?
[01:21:21.455 --> 01:21:22.676]  Or just a common sense person?
[01:21:23.056 --> 01:21:24.057]  You're not a public figure.
[01:21:24.137 --> 01:21:25.719]  You don't know what Donald Trump goes through.
[01:21:26.059 --> 01:21:27.240]  You don't know what I go through.
[01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:29.421]  And I'm not trying to say I go through anything when his family does.
[01:21:30.382 --> 01:21:31.163]  They're vicious.
[01:21:31.203 --> 01:21:31.883]  They're bullies.
[01:21:32.204 --> 01:21:33.004]  They're frothing.
[01:21:33.044 --> 01:21:40.991]  I mean, I've seen old film reels of people getting beat up in communist countries if they weren't communist, or in Nazi Germany if they were, you know, trade unionists or Jewish.
[01:21:41.651 --> 01:21:42.831]  You're so right about that, Alex.
[01:21:42.851 --> 01:21:50.033]  You know, I live here in New York City and many, many years ago I was an editor at the New York Times when the Times was still a straight newspaper, which of course it hasn't been for a long time.
[01:22:11.707 --> 01:22:28.199]  All my friends here in New York, 90% of whom are liberals, have gone so far as to not only shun me, but if they meet me in a restaurant or on the street, they don't even acknowledge me.
[01:22:28.239 --> 01:22:29.540]  They won't even say hello to me.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:37.285]  I have friends of decades standing, they were friends, who tell me that they don't want to have anything more to do with me.
[01:22:37.626 --> 01:22:39.307]  It's like the religious wars
[01:22:40.017 --> 01:22:46.999]  In the 17th century, when people burned each other at the stakes because of their religious differences.
[01:22:47.500 --> 01:23:00.824]  Here in this country, we're having the same kind of religious war, if you will, between progressives on the left, those so-called progressives, and conservatives like you and me on the right.
[01:23:01.344 --> 01:23:06.606]  What's going to happen if in 2018, which is just around the corner of course,
[01:23:07.293 --> 01:23:10.594]  The Democrats get control of the House of Representatives.
[01:23:11.075 --> 01:23:15.977]  That's what this whole war against Trump is aimed at.
[01:23:16.457 --> 01:23:25.941]  Getting control of the House of Representatives so that the first thing they will do is put forth impeachment proceedings against this president.
[01:23:28.715 --> 01:23:35.242]  And it's just crazy to see all the footage of them beating up reporters, Antifa will just attack even mainstream news, police.
[01:23:35.282 --> 01:23:37.845]  They're just frothing and so filled with hate.
[01:23:38.426 --> 01:23:41.830]  Do you think they're going to get more degenerate, more insane before they get better?
[01:23:41.870 --> 01:23:45.434]  Or as a historian and a smart guy, where do you see this going?
[01:23:46.331 --> 01:23:51.875]  I think it's going to get a lot worse because we're moving into the midterm elections when so much is at stake.
[01:23:52.336 --> 01:23:57.199]  I guess you can hear in the background the typical New York sounds of sirens.
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:02.884]  Those are generally ambulances, not police, but sometimes they're police.
[01:24:04.305 --> 01:24:15.193]  And come 2018, the Democrats are going to be desperate to get control of the House of Representatives and the Senate.
[01:24:15.828 --> 01:24:26.333]  What will that mean in terms of this war that we're talking about, this bitter, underhanded lies and deceit that we see on the left?
[01:24:26.794 --> 01:24:28.034]  It's going to get a lot worse.
[01:24:28.074 --> 01:24:38.860]  In fact, I believe that you're going to see a lot more violence on the left, because as you know, these groups like Antifa and other violent groups say that they like violence.
[01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:43.222]  They even consider themselves and proud of the fact that they're communists.
[01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:43.729]  And
[01:25:02.162 --> 01:25:05.103]  Well, you could argue, if I can talk to you above this noise outside my window.
[01:25:24.183 --> 01:25:24.644]  Okay.
[01:25:25.164 --> 01:25:38.454]  You could argue that the further left and nutty they get, the more like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and the Antifa group they get, the better, in some ways, it will be for conservatives.
[01:25:38.514 --> 01:25:39.895]  Because you're so right.
[01:25:40.275 --> 01:25:50.883]  Between the left coast and the right coast of this country, the so-called parenthesis around the real America, real Americans don't buy this left-wing stuff.
[01:25:50.963 --> 01:25:51.464]  You know that.
[01:25:52.805 --> 01:25:57.346]  So, you're a guy that's well known for being able to predict a lot of things that are unfolding.
[01:25:57.806 --> 01:26:05.688]  We're not looking at a crystal ball here, but barring assassination, the economy's coming back, people are really turning against the controlled left.
[01:26:06.448 --> 01:26:10.729]  I just see Trump being a very successful president, one of the most successful ever.
[01:26:11.389 --> 01:26:14.930]  Globally, globalism and authoritarian leftist garbage is in trouble.
[01:26:15.130 --> 01:26:16.670]  I mean, can't they see the massive trend?
[01:26:18.206 --> 01:26:21.367]  I don't see, they don't want to see this massive trend.
[01:26:21.407 --> 01:26:24.368]  We're now at what, 3.1% growth in this country.
[01:26:24.528 --> 01:26:24.748]  Yes.
[01:26:24.788 --> 01:26:30.290]  Which is a whole, at least percentage point ahead of Obama and we're probably going to do a lot better.
[01:26:30.850 --> 01:26:36.192]  We've got 70, we've stopped 70% of the illegal crossings in the southern border.
[01:26:36.652 --> 01:26:38.413]  We're getting to be energy independent.
[01:26:38.473 --> 01:26:39.033]  Thank you.
[01:26:39.673 --> 01:26:41.534]  Thank you, Donald Trump.
[01:26:42.194 --> 01:26:44.635]  And now he's on this Asian tour.
[01:26:45.168 --> 01:26:58.450]  Which if you look at the mainstream media, they're almost ignoring because they can see that he and America are more respected today in Asia than they ever were in the eight years of Barack Obama.
[01:26:59.450 --> 01:27:08.672]  And the Congressional Budget Office predicts that if we get the House tax cut combined with this growth rate, we're looking at a 7.1 growth rate within two years.
[01:27:08.852 --> 01:27:13.753]  I mean, and then they're fighting to the nail openly to stop it, calling it a nightmare.
[01:27:14.818 --> 01:27:25.563]  And what could be better, if I may just digress for a second, than a 5%, 6%, 7% growth rate for the minorities in this country?
[01:27:26.304 --> 01:27:31.766]  It will be the average everyday American who will benefit from this growth rate.
[01:27:31.806 --> 01:27:42.692]  Finally, they'll get good paying jobs, they'll get raises, they'll be able to reinstate what we've lost, the American dream, which is that our kids and our grandkids
[01:27:43.376 --> 01:27:46.378]  Can look forward to living an even better life than we do.
[01:27:47.478 --> 01:27:50.300]  Well, please come back again as this all unfolds.
[01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:51.460]  I can't wait to read the book.
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:52.161]  I've ordered one.
[01:27:52.681 --> 01:27:54.922]  Of course, it's All Out War, the plot to destroy Trump.
[01:27:55.102 --> 01:27:57.183]  You're dead on and I know I'm going to learn a lot.
[01:27:57.203 --> 01:28:00.625]  So thank you for being a watchman on the wall and have a good week coming up.
[01:28:01.431 --> 01:28:02.391]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:28:02.612 --> 01:28:03.032]  Thank you.
[01:28:03.792 --> 01:28:05.833]  Folks, we are in deep, deep trouble.
[01:28:05.893 --> 01:28:07.754]  Good things are happening, but bad things are happening.
[01:28:07.774 --> 01:28:18.639]  And I want to be confident in all this, but at the same time, we've got to know, they are getting more and more violent, more and more deranged, and I'm here to tell you, the left has talked about doing false flags.
[01:28:18.659 --> 01:28:19.460]  They've gotten smart.
[01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:22.501]  Like Vegas, or like what we saw here in Texas.
[01:28:23.201 --> 01:28:27.463]  A pedophile, atheist, Christian hater, who beats up his family.
[01:28:28.604 --> 01:28:30.305]  These are all about being selfish pigs.
[01:28:31.536 --> 01:28:32.917]  And it's always the same M.O.
[01:28:32.957 --> 01:28:33.697]  of all these people.
[01:28:35.518 --> 01:28:37.299]  And it happened again.
[01:28:37.319 --> 01:28:39.740]  And then they blame us, the 2nd Amendment.
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:40.780]  They blame the NRA.
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:46.143]  And it turns out it's an NRA trainer who took the scum back out.
[01:28:46.163 --> 01:28:53.166]  We're going to take your phone calls and a lot more coming up in the next segment.
[01:28:53.186 --> 01:28:53.466]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:28:53.486 --> 01:28:54.466]  877-789-A-L-E-X.
[01:28:54.927 --> 01:28:56.067]  This is the Info War.
[01:28:56.147 --> 01:28:57.007]  Please spread the links.
[01:28:57.308 --> 01:28:59.449]  Because there is an all-out war against this Republic.
[01:28:59.749 --> 01:29:00.189]  Stay with us.
[01:29:12.018 --> 01:29:12.510]  Just briefly.
[01:29:13.738 --> 01:29:15.759]  My dad is an oral surgeon and dentist.
[01:29:15.779 --> 01:29:16.639]  He's about to retire.
[01:29:16.659 --> 01:29:23.623]  And about 15 years ago, he heard me ranting and raving about fluoride and toothpaste and how it causes brain damage and lower IQ and dental fluorosis.
[01:29:23.683 --> 01:29:26.764]  And he said, son, I don't care who you have on the air.
[01:29:26.784 --> 01:29:27.785]  That's a bunch of bull.
[01:29:28.285 --> 01:29:29.365]  You need fluoride or you die.
[01:29:29.925 --> 01:29:32.407]  And I actually showed him what was in the water supply and the fluoride.
[01:29:32.427 --> 01:29:33.207]  He said, this is incredible.
[01:29:33.627 --> 01:29:35.608]  This is Grignard Reagent's heavy metals.
[01:29:35.648 --> 01:29:41.531]  They're covering for it, calling it fluoride under law with a loophole to dump toxic waste in the food and water.
[01:29:42.131 --> 01:29:42.612]  Exactly.
[01:29:42.672 --> 01:29:48.660]  Now, CNN had to admit last month, in utero and in children, massive IQ reductions.
[01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:52.505]  Well, six years ago, the EPA said reduce it in water by half.
[01:29:53.867 --> 01:29:57.391]  You don't drink your sunscreen, but hydrofluorosilicic acid is a
[01:29:58.370 --> 01:29:58.790]  I don't
[01:30:15.168 --> 01:30:18.730]  The American Dental Association says don't brush children's teeth until age 6 with it.
[01:30:19.170 --> 01:30:20.371]  Why does it say nursery water?
[01:30:20.391 --> 01:30:21.632]  They're at the store with added fluoride.
[01:30:21.692 --> 01:30:24.593]  And they didn't add calcium fluoride, boys and girls.
[01:30:24.633 --> 01:30:26.594]  They added hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:30:26.794 --> 01:30:36.560]  That's why my dad and I developed, with the same folks that make Toms of Maine, private labeled, super blue, non-fluoride toothpaste with colloidal silver and high-quality iodine.
[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:38.361]  But you die without iodine.
[01:30:38.381 --> 01:30:39.922]  Massive iodine deficiencies in the country.
[01:30:39.942 --> 01:30:41.723]  If you drink the stuff that's at the store, it'll kill you.
[01:30:41.763 --> 01:30:42.683]  That's a different type of iodine.
[01:30:42.703 --> 01:30:44.104]  This is the real medical grade.
[01:30:44.544 --> 01:30:52.836]  It's 33% off right now, and we have the bubble gum, natural flavor, organic flavor for children, that doesn't have as much of the peppermint in it, because it says concentrated toothpaste.
[01:30:53.437 --> 01:30:56.761]  Super Blue Toothpaste, available at InfoWarsTore.com!
[01:31:02.088 --> 01:31:11.100]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:19.251]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:31:19.591 --> 01:31:24.294]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[01:31:38.423 --> 01:31:45.287]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:31:45.447 --> 01:31:49.791]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[01:32:02.263 --> 01:32:06.467]  Men, give your body the support it needs with InfoWars Life Prostagard.
[01:32:06.987 --> 01:32:10.931]  It's time to start assisting the body in regulating proper prostate balance.

[01:32:22.636 --> 01:32:30.380]  The Prostagard formula does just that, with its mixture of plant-based nutrients and antioxidants that help give your body total support.

[01:32:36.062 --> 01:32:37.083]  We're good to go.
[01:33:05.986 --> 01:33:08.598]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:28.090 --> 01:33:34.134]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:34.834 --> 01:33:38.617]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:39.717 --> 01:33:46.181]  You want to talk about sickening rejection?
[01:33:47.302 --> 01:33:56.828]  There's a Newsweek article out attacking myself, Cernovich, everybody else, saying, why is the right obsessed with pedophilia?
[01:34:00.228 --> 01:34:04.470]  Newsweek, of course, is on the verge of going bankrupt, just laid off half their people because they're fake news.
[01:34:05.250 --> 01:34:06.451]  They're about as bad as it gets.
[01:34:09.072 --> 01:34:10.493]  I'm obsessed with Americana.
[01:34:12.174 --> 01:34:16.376]  And we are exposing the pedophile rings in Hollywood and D.C.
[01:34:16.756 --> 01:34:18.537]  You know, like the Deputy Pope?
[01:34:21.138 --> 01:34:22.259]  The Deputy Pope?
[01:34:23.839 --> 01:34:28.362]  Who just got arrested for reportedly corralling over 100 kids for sex?
[01:34:29.648 --> 01:34:32.590]  And all the underage stuff with Kevin Spacey and the rest of it?
[01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:47.498]  And then Newsweek brings up Comet Ping Pong pizza again that Time Magazine, the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN all put on the radar during the Podesta emails that are very creepy, had nothing to do with Comet Ping Pong.
[01:34:47.778 --> 01:34:51.661]  The media focused on it where Podesta did go and eat some and his brother
[01:34:52.301 --> 01:35:03.007]  And had fundraisers, made it all about that, put info out in the press, the media made it the spotlight, to then say there's no such thing as pedophilia in the world, basically.
[01:35:05.349 --> 01:35:07.530]  So it was a false flag, a controlled demolition.
[01:35:08.590 --> 01:35:11.871]  A diversion from all of Jerry Epstein's behavior.
[01:35:12.131 --> 01:35:17.912]  And Wiener, who just went to prison yesterday to serve out his sentence for going after an underage girl.
[01:35:18.292 --> 01:35:19.232]  And all the rest of it.
[01:35:19.532 --> 01:35:24.093]  And Nickelodeon and the media sexualizing children and all the admissions.
[01:35:25.294 --> 01:35:27.614]  Dennis Hastert, the former Speaker of the House.
[01:35:29.675 --> 01:35:32.595]  NAMBLA all over the place trying to get pedophilia legalized.
[01:35:33.095 --> 01:35:35.516]  The schools sexualizing children.
[01:35:40.322 --> 01:35:43.484]  And then they hang their whole hat on Pizzagate.
[01:35:44.345 --> 01:35:47.967]  The FBI has manuals about pizza used as codes.
[01:35:49.108 --> 01:35:51.369]  And Italian food used in codes by pedophiles.
[01:35:51.810 --> 01:35:53.231]  Cheese pizza means child pornography.
[01:35:53.771 --> 01:35:56.873]  And it was all in there, about $65,000 of succulent hot dogs.
[01:35:56.933 --> 01:35:57.774]  And, oh, these are the best.
[01:35:58.094 --> 01:36:00.335]  Well, they weren't good that last time, but this time they'll be good.
[01:36:00.556 --> 01:36:01.676]  And they'll be brown sauce.
[01:36:01.696 --> 01:36:03.598]  Well, I don't want too many nuts on the sauce.
[01:36:04.218 --> 01:36:05.439]  Are these nuts really good?
[01:36:05.459 --> 01:36:08.221]  And we'll have the kids, for your pleasure, in the hot tub.
[01:36:11.069 --> 01:36:12.350]  Well, are the kids going to be fun?
[01:36:12.510 --> 01:36:14.150]  Well, yeah, they're still kids, though.
[01:36:16.772 --> 01:36:21.774]  I mean, we'll have blood and semen for you in the ritual for you to drink.
[01:36:22.695 --> 01:36:24.916]  And it's an Aleister Crowley High Priestess.
[01:36:25.016 --> 01:36:28.077]  I mean, and so that's all going on.
[01:36:28.197 --> 01:36:31.339]  And then all of a sudden, the mainstream media goes, look at Comet Ping Pong Pizza.
[01:36:32.599 --> 01:36:35.421]  And I go to Cancun for a week with my family, and I see us reporting on it.
[01:36:35.801 --> 01:36:37.662]  And I watch a bunch of it, and I go, a lot of that
[01:36:38.632 --> 01:36:45.479]  Really sounds crazy, but everything about it, I think this is a setup by the media focusing on it, but there's not a basement in that place, and I said, we'll see.
[01:36:46.239 --> 01:36:49.362]  I even had a few crew members kind of, Alex, I can't believe you're covering up.
[01:36:50.046 --> 01:36:52.828]  And I said, listen, every GD one of these is going down.
[01:36:53.568 --> 01:37:00.833]  And I said, I said, I know there's people there on video at the pizza place talking about how they like kids at the open mic.
[01:37:00.993 --> 01:37:01.574]  I go, whatever!
[01:37:02.134 --> 01:37:03.355]  That's some rock band that was there.
[01:37:03.855 --> 01:37:08.819]  The real stuff is the sex trafficking out of Haiti and the AP reports and all this other stuff.
[01:37:09.059 --> 01:37:13.842]  The media is wanting us like a mockingbird will act like it's wings broken to get you away from its nest.
[01:37:15.023 --> 01:37:16.244]  And of course I was proven right again.
[01:37:17.688 --> 01:37:28.544]  Then I do the right thing and say, yes, that was wrong info, we report other people's reports, and the media makes it like I made everything up, and that I'm this horrible person when I'm the one that caught it and cleaned it up.
[01:37:29.606 --> 01:37:31.048]  No good deed goes unpunished.
[01:37:33.086 --> 01:37:40.851]  And then now I get to see the media run with this same thing, how Jones and everybody made this up, and it doesn't exist.
[01:37:41.331 --> 01:37:42.792]  Very shameful of Newsweek.
[01:37:43.192 --> 01:37:55.039]  New lows for you guys, and there's record busts of pedophiles all over the country, and record numbers of people getting caught, and the sex trafficking, and Hollywood's going down, and all of it.
[01:37:55.079 --> 01:37:56.720]  So, good luck Newsweek.
[01:37:59.362 --> 01:38:01.563]  Good luck being apologists for what's going on.
[01:38:06.118 --> 01:38:07.378]  It's simply amazing.
[01:38:08.359 --> 01:38:13.180]  And they never tell you Pizzagate is about code words and FBI manuals.
[01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:15.821]  It's always about Comic Ping Pong, a pizza place.
[01:38:16.821 --> 01:38:25.883]  They semantically manipulate the public and then basically use their own people as scapegoats who aren't involved in this behavior.
[01:38:26.323 --> 01:38:27.604]  But there's no evidence to that fact.
[01:38:30.384 --> 01:38:32.125]  But Podesta constantly tweets out
[01:38:33.154 --> 01:38:37.040]  That I should eat crap and that I'm pathetic and ah ha ha when he's the one in deep trouble?
[01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:43.248]  Listen, I've never retracted anything I said about Podesta and the emails about spirit cooking and we'll have the blood and semen ready.
[01:38:43.649 --> 01:38:44.891]  WikiLeaks put all that out.
[01:38:45.011 --> 01:38:46.052]  That's real, folks.
[01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:49.562]  And what do you do when you're caught with the Russians?
[01:38:49.622 --> 01:38:50.682]  You call the enemy Russians.
[01:38:51.003 --> 01:39:07.415]  What do you do when there's all these thousands of emails about, we'll be at the farmhouse for the adult party, three children, these ages, you know, 6, 7 and 9 will be delivered to the hot tub, the pool is not heated but the hot tub is, they will be in the hot tub waiting for you!
[01:39:13.953 --> 01:39:14.733]  Well I can't wait.
[01:39:15.233 --> 01:39:17.774]  That's what old Podesta wants to get the depositions on that one.
[01:39:18.054 --> 01:39:22.675]  What the hell's going on with the hot tub and the kids waiting there for your entertainment?
[01:39:22.835 --> 01:39:23.495]  That's the quote.
[01:39:27.195 --> 01:39:41.018]  And then Podesta's brother did a spread in 2007 in the Washington Post about his radical dangerous art, that's the quotes, with images of naked children that I won't even show on air.
[01:39:43.735 --> 01:39:47.916]  Because they could selectively enforce and put me in jail for pedophilia, folks.
[01:39:48.917 --> 01:39:50.217]  We're talking two-year-olds.
[01:39:51.297 --> 01:39:51.657]  Look at this.
[01:39:52.538 --> 01:39:54.578]  The plan to heat the pool so a swim is possible.
[01:39:55.138 --> 01:39:58.399]  Bonnie will Uber service to transport Ruby Emerson.
[01:39:58.419 --> 01:40:01.961]  It says 9 and 7.
[01:40:03.101 --> 01:40:06.862]  So you'll have some further attainment and they will be in the pool for sure.
[01:40:09.143 --> 01:40:10.703]  I mean, it just goes on and on, man.
[01:40:11.163 --> 01:40:12.924]  And all we said is, what is this?
[01:40:14.071 --> 01:40:28.837]  And you're hanging around with Epstein, and Bill Clinton's on the plane with Epstein, and so is this creature, Harvey Weinstein, and they've got an island where they take little kids.
[01:40:28.917 --> 01:40:33.840]  I mean, this is all confirmed, and you think you're going to divert us with the pizza place.
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:34.620]  No, you're not!
[01:40:39.295 --> 01:40:39.775]  There you go.
[01:40:39.835 --> 01:40:41.757]  Kevin Spacey went on that airplane, too.
[01:40:41.837 --> 01:40:42.798]  He likes to have fun.
[01:40:42.838 --> 01:40:48.602]  His dad was a, quote, devil-worshipping Nazi that raped him and his brothers and sisters.
[01:40:49.843 --> 01:40:50.423]  Talk him out!
[01:40:52.665 --> 01:40:56.848]  And I told you, I said people like Spacey were used to get kids when he was a kid.
[01:40:57.208 --> 01:40:58.189]  It's always the same.
[01:40:58.509 --> 01:41:03.753]  They use well-spoken, good-looking kids as the lure, just like an anglerfish does.
[01:41:08.496 --> 01:41:09.837]  Why does he play a good psychopath?
[01:41:10.718 --> 01:41:12.319]  Because he is a psychopath.
[01:41:15.242 --> 01:41:16.263]  So, that's all coming up.
[01:41:16.303 --> 01:41:17.744]  I'm going to come back to your phone calls, though.
[01:41:17.844 --> 01:41:18.885]  I've got a lot of other news to hit.
[01:41:19.946 --> 01:41:22.248]  But, that's why they're coming after us, folks.
[01:41:22.288 --> 01:41:31.517]  Because, and I'm not at liberty to get into a lot of it this time, I just want everybody to understand, if you want to see us stand against the enemy, like a lighthouse in a storm,
[01:41:33.061 --> 01:41:33.762]  And prevail.
[01:41:33.882 --> 01:41:34.943]  Pray for us, number one.
[01:41:35.183 --> 01:41:37.386]  Spread the videos and the articles, number two, because that's the Infowar.
[01:41:37.646 --> 01:41:38.126]  That's critical.
[01:41:38.146 --> 01:41:46.175]  But number three, financially commit to go to InfowarStore.com and sign up for DNA Force for you and your family.
[01:41:46.275 --> 01:41:47.857]  Nothing's going to clean out your cells and your body.
[01:41:47.877 --> 01:41:49.558]  There's no antioxidant even close to it.
[01:41:50.529 --> 01:41:51.630]  That protects your telomeres.
[01:41:51.710 --> 01:41:52.650]  Read the studies for yourself.
[01:41:53.150 --> 01:41:55.852]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, the Reservintol, all of it.
[01:41:56.252 --> 01:41:56.992]  What a product.
[01:41:57.012 --> 01:41:59.274]  25% off, even though it's been sold out almost four months.

[01:42:04.877 --> 01:42:07.178]  We've got a bunch of stuff that has sold out.
[01:42:07.258 --> 01:42:18.724]  In fact, Tim Fergé brought me all the specials that aren't on anymore, and I walked out of his office and laid them in, I think, in my bathroom, I think I left them, or on the table outside my office.
[01:42:20.145 --> 01:42:21.625]  Because a bunch of stuff has sold out.
[01:42:22.226 --> 01:42:25.467]  The Winter Sun, a bunch of other stuff has had to stop the sales on.
[01:42:26.087 --> 01:42:32.429]  But we do have the DNA Force, the Biome Defense, Secret 12 is still on sale, and a lot of other great products.

[01:42:54.117 --> 01:42:54.977]  We're fighting for you.
[01:42:55.317 --> 01:42:56.378]  We're fighting for ourselves.
[01:42:56.778 --> 01:42:57.878]  We're in this all together.
[01:42:58.138 --> 01:42:59.859]  And I'm committed to giving you everything I've got.
[01:43:03.112 --> 01:43:11.776]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[01:43:11.836 --> 01:43:12.317]  That's right.

[01:43:31.906 --> 01:43:32.107]  Whoo!
[01:43:32.147 --> 01:43:32.927]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:43:33.187 --> 01:43:41.773]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[01:43:41.913 --> 01:43:51.139]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[01:43:51.519 --> 01:43:54.842]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[01:43:54.962 --> 01:43:58.924]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[01:43:59.064 --> 01:43:59.985]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:10.673]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[01:44:11.053 --> 01:44:12.574]  Up, up, up, up, optimum levels.
[01:44:13.595 --> 01:44:18.218]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[01:44:18.238 --> 01:44:20.180]  Up, up, up, up, optimum levels.
[01:44:20.580 --> 01:44:22.221]  B vitamins we need every day.
[01:44:22.381 --> 01:44:27.445]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[01:44:27.645 --> 01:44:29.247]  Up, up, up, up, optimal absorption.
[01:44:29.967 --> 01:44:35.051]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[01:44:35.591 --> 01:44:35.952]  Secret 12.
[01:44:37.433 --> 01:44:38.313]  Optimal absorption.
[01:44:38.593 --> 01:44:43.297]  B vitamins help the body convert food into energy by supporting your intercellular processes.
[01:44:43.737 --> 01:44:47.940]  B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system.
[01:44:48.921 --> 01:44:49.662]  Optimum levels.
[01:44:51.082 --> 01:44:54.904]  Secret 12 is an easy way to increase your vitamin B12 intake.

[01:45:11.691 --> 01:45:12.251]  Just briefly.
[01:45:13.482 --> 01:45:15.505]  My dad is an oral surgeon and dentist.
[01:45:15.525 --> 01:45:16.426]  He's about to retire.
[01:45:17.007 --> 01:45:23.476]  About 15 years ago, he heard me ranting and raving about fluoride and toothpaste and how it causes brain damage and lower IQ and dental fluorosis.
[01:45:23.537 --> 01:45:26.501]  And he said, son, I don't care who you have on the air.
[01:45:26.541 --> 01:45:27.522]  That's a bunch of bull.
[01:45:28.043 --> 01:45:29.084]  You need fluoride or you die.
[01:45:29.665 --> 01:45:32.127]  And I actually showed him what was in the water supply in the Florida.
[01:45:32.147 --> 01:45:32.947]  He said, this is incredible.
[01:45:33.347 --> 01:45:35.329]  This is Grignard Reagent's heavy metals.
[01:45:35.389 --> 01:45:41.272]  They're covering for it, calling it Florida under law with a loophole to dump toxic waste in the food and water.
[01:45:41.872 --> 01:45:42.353]  Exactly.
[01:45:42.413 --> 01:45:48.396]  Now, CNN had to admit last month, in utero and in children, massive IQ reductions.
[01:45:48.456 --> 01:45:52.219]  Well, six years ago, the EPA said, reduce it in water by half.
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:57.122]  You don't drink your sunscreen, but hydrofluorosilicic acid is a
[01:45:58.114 --> 01:45:58.534]  I don't
[01:46:14.906 --> 01:46:18.469]  The American Dental Association says don't brush children's teeth until age six with it.
[01:46:18.909 --> 01:46:21.371]  Why does it say nursery water than at the store with added fluoride?
[01:46:21.431 --> 01:46:24.333]  And they didn't add calcium fluoride, boys and girls.
[01:46:24.373 --> 01:46:26.355]  They added hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:46:26.535 --> 01:46:36.302]  That's why my dad and I developed, with the same folks that make Toms of Maine, it's private-labeled, Super Blue non-fluoride toothpaste with colloidal silver and high-quality iodine.
[01:46:36.863 --> 01:46:38.104]  But you die without iodine.
[01:46:38.124 --> 01:46:39.665]  Massive iodine deficiencies in the country.
[01:46:39.685 --> 01:46:41.466]  If you drink the stuff that's at the store, it'll kill you.
[01:46:41.506 --> 01:46:42.427]  That's a different type of iodine.
[01:46:42.447 --> 01:46:43.848]  This is the real medical grade.
[01:46:44.288 --> 01:46:52.575]  It's 33% off right now, and we have the bubble gum, natural flavor, organic flavor for children, that doesn't have as much of the peppermint in it, because it says concentrated toothpaste.
[01:46:53.175 --> 01:46:56.558]  Super Blue Toothpaste, available at infowarstore.com!
[01:47:05.524 --> 01:47:08.166]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:23.271 --> 01:47:24.672]  We are on the march.
[01:47:24.973 --> 01:47:27.456]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:47:28.197 --> 01:47:31.941]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:47:33.864 --> 01:47:36.147]  We're not playing tiddlywinks, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:47:37.264 --> 01:47:38.765]  We're going to your phone calls right now.
[01:47:38.865 --> 01:47:45.671]  Tom in London, Mark in Oregon, Jack in Florida, Alyssa in Oregon, Tal in South Carolina, and many others.
[01:47:46.452 --> 01:47:47.592]  I see the phone lines are loaded.
[01:47:47.612 --> 01:47:49.994]  When you hear somebody hang up, that's your chance to call in.
[01:47:50.014 --> 01:47:50.315]  877-789-2539.
[01:47:51.316 --> 01:47:53.637]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:47:53.657 --> 01:47:55.099]  I want to thank all of our affiliates.
[01:47:55.119 --> 01:47:56.119]  Please remember to support them.
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:48:00.483]  And I want to thank the amazing crew surrounding me here in this great
[01:48:01.844 --> 01:48:27.168]  News center we've built and just all my family and everybody else for what they put up with but they understand we're up against bullies and so everybody's fighting harder and stronger and more focused than ever and as we begin to see victory and as we find our will again the enemy really tries to put their fangs out and takes the mask off and boy didn't just confirm everything we knew
[01:48:28.615 --> 01:48:32.938]  And it doesn't just make you 100% absolutely commit to defeating these people.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:38.162]  They think their intimidation works on us, they're gonna find out real good.
[01:48:38.182 --> 01:48:43.266]  They're gonna find out what we're made of, what they're made of.
[01:48:44.343 --> 01:48:48.008]  We're going to get them off the backs of our children, because that's who they're obsessed with.
[01:48:48.188 --> 01:48:52.914]  They want to mentally screw them up, they want to have sex with them, they want to brainwash them and turn them into them.
[01:48:53.715 --> 01:48:55.137]  Evil targets the youth!
[01:48:55.978 --> 01:48:58.961]  So yeah, Newsweek, we're obsessed with exposing pedophilia.
[01:48:59.889 --> 01:49:00.910]  And we're being proven right!
[01:49:01.370 --> 01:49:15.121]  So you keep trying to act like it isn't going on, as all around people get caught running child kidnapping rings, and caught with dead children, and caught in cages, and as the Deputy Pope and all the Hollywood people get busted, you keep telling everybody it didn't exist!
[01:49:18.524 --> 01:49:21.846]  Hell, why don't you get in a time machine and go back and say, Hitler didn't exist!
[01:49:22.106 --> 01:49:22.827]  Or Stalin!
[01:49:23.467 --> 01:49:25.269]  Or Mao Zedong, you jerks!
[01:49:29.113 --> 01:49:30.314]  You don't control reality anymore.
[01:49:30.534 --> 01:49:32.316]  You think we're 10 years ago or 20 years ago.
[01:49:33.417 --> 01:49:36.299]  You still think you got your thumb on America or the world?
[01:49:36.459 --> 01:49:36.959]  Well, guess what?
[01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:38.501]  You don't, scumbags!
[01:49:41.363 --> 01:49:44.145]  It's all that's left at places like Newsweek's The Scum of the Earth.
[01:49:44.886 --> 01:49:47.488]  That's why they had a 50% layoff this month of what was left.
[01:49:48.869 --> 01:49:51.952]  It's the scum of the scum that'll do whatever they're told.
[01:49:53.524 --> 01:49:53.964]  Well, good!
[01:49:54.605 --> 01:50:00.549]  Just send your race to the bottom even faster, because mentally ill people like you don't ever know when to give up, do you?
[01:50:02.310 --> 01:50:06.893]  Coming up, CNN directing employees to discredit Donna Brazile.
[01:50:07.053 --> 01:50:07.813]  Wow!
[01:50:08.174 --> 01:50:08.914]  What a surprise!
[01:50:09.234 --> 01:50:12.357]  Saudi Arabia calls missile launch an act of war with Iran.
[01:50:14.616 --> 01:50:16.538]  We got the president over there in Asia.
[01:50:16.558 --> 01:50:17.499]  We'll break that down.
[01:50:17.859 --> 01:50:21.824]  They're mounting fighter jets with pulse laser particle beam weapon systems.
[01:50:22.124 --> 01:50:23.626]  Told you they had that 20-something years ago.
[01:50:23.666 --> 01:50:26.649]  It's been declassified longer than that, but now it's powerful weapons.
[01:50:26.989 --> 01:50:29.592]  The latest on the Texas massacre and so much more.
[01:50:30.033 --> 01:50:31.114]  It's all coming up.
[01:50:33.587 --> 01:50:35.048]  Oh, and one more thing before I go to your call.
[01:50:35.128 --> 01:50:37.649]  I'll do it at the end of the next hour, but I'm going to start taking some right now from London.
[01:50:37.949 --> 01:50:39.410]  Let's play that clip I mentioned earlier.
[01:50:39.430 --> 01:50:41.911]  I forgot to get to Fox about 20 minutes ago during a break.
[01:50:42.431 --> 01:50:48.514]  I was getting myself a little cup of coffee here in my DrudgeReport.com coffee cup, because we're fans around here.
[01:50:49.395 --> 01:50:58.119]  And there they were announcing that hearings, they're calling Sessions in next week to grill him like he did something wrong.
[01:50:58.359 --> 01:50:59.600]  And he just sits there and takes it.
[01:51:00.558 --> 01:51:04.661]  Well, they're all caught red-handed doing 10,000 times anything he supposedly ever did.
[01:51:04.681 --> 01:51:10.525]  And he just sits there and just continues Fox News, all part of the fraud.
[01:51:10.785 --> 01:51:11.826]  Here, let's just go to it right now.
[01:51:11.866 --> 01:51:12.146]  Here it is.
[01:51:16.107 --> 01:51:21.931]  We are learning Attorney General Jeff Sessions will testify before the House Judiciary Committee next Tuesday.
[01:51:22.392 --> 01:51:31.459]  We're told it's part of a routine Justice Department oversight hearing, but it does come just days after Senate Democrats demanded Sessions return to Capitol Hill to clarify his statements on Russia.
[01:51:31.879 --> 01:51:44.330]  Democrats on the House panel not wasting any time after the announcement issuing a press release with the title that they're putting Sessions quote on notice saying they want answers after new documents revealed that a former Trump campaign advisor
[01:51:44.850 --> 01:51:48.253]  Push to set up a meeting between then-candidate Donald Trump and Russia.
[01:51:48.613 --> 01:51:48.873]  Please.
[01:51:51.515 --> 01:52:00.262]  Papanopoulos, who was never even paid by the campaign, who we now know is in deep with the Democrats, kept asking for them to meet with Russians and they said no every time!
[01:52:00.922 --> 01:52:05.346]  So now the big hearings are about one low-level guy who tried to get Russia meetings and was rebuffed!
[01:52:08.814 --> 01:52:15.639]  That'd be like saying you drove by a hooker, a street hooker, with her leg out and stopped at a stop sign that she was by.
[01:52:15.859 --> 01:52:21.123]  And then you drove on past, and a year later they got a video and they go, sir, you drove by a hooker and you stopped.
[01:52:21.163 --> 01:52:22.003]  Well, there was a stop sign.
[01:52:22.344 --> 01:52:23.564]  Well, we're taking your car.
[01:52:26.767 --> 01:52:31.250]  There it is, Sessions rejected Russia proposal by campaign advisor, which he's always talked about.
[01:52:32.711 --> 01:52:36.236]  And the worst they've got is at some Trump event, there was a Russian ambassador there.
[01:52:36.556 --> 01:52:37.358]  Oh my God!
[01:52:37.678 --> 01:52:39.461]  Meanwhile, the Democrats are totally in bed with it.
[01:52:39.481 --> 01:52:44.828]  Here, let's continue with the show Outnumbered on Fox.
[01:52:44.868 --> 01:52:45.169]  Here it is.
[01:52:47.585 --> 01:52:52.290]  So Papanopoulos did this, and Carter Page did a personal trip to Russia, and Sessions didn't know it all.
[01:53:11.459 --> 01:53:15.943]  That'd be like saying, you know, did the janitor that works here go visit his mommy last month?
[01:53:16.404 --> 01:53:19.667]  And why don't I know that if he brushed his teeth this morning and ate his Wheaties?
[01:53:23.610 --> 01:53:24.031]  Meanwhile...
[01:53:25.216 --> 01:53:36.345]  You've got Mueller killing the investigation of Uranium One, Batman on tarmacs in Moscow, with weapons-grade Uranium and hundreds of millions of dollars, and just... I'm sorry.
[01:53:37.085 --> 01:53:38.666]  Tom in London.
[01:53:39.527 --> 01:53:40.668]  Tom, you're on the air.
[01:53:40.708 --> 01:53:41.689]  Thank you for calling today.
[01:53:41.709 --> 01:53:43.790]  Hi, Alex.
[01:53:44.151 --> 01:53:44.651]  Welcome, sir.
[01:53:46.372 --> 01:53:50.495]  Yeah, so I've got a prediction today about Trump.
[01:53:53.388 --> 01:53:57.030]  I just want to establish my track record on predictions on your show.
[01:53:57.490 --> 01:53:58.010]  It's pretty much 100%.
[01:53:58.110 --> 01:54:06.734]  I mean, two and a half years ago, I predicted Trump would win, and Brexit would pass.
[01:54:06.894 --> 01:54:08.515]  I put bets on, and so on.
[01:54:08.975 --> 01:54:11.857]  I remember you, Cole, or somebody with your similar voice.
[01:54:13.418 --> 01:54:18.900]  Yeah, yeah, and you have a freakish memory, and you sort of, you always remember, you know, my previous calls.
[01:54:20.041 --> 01:54:20.501]  So, yeah.
[01:54:20.641 --> 01:54:21.802]  Well, you have a distinctive voice.
[01:54:23.979 --> 01:54:28.364]  Last time I spoke to you, actually, was three weeks before the general election in the UK.
[01:54:29.625 --> 01:54:32.007]  Aren't you the guy that also thinks I'm too hard on Islam?
[01:54:34.170 --> 01:54:44.060]  Um, well, I think, well, well, yeah, well, yes, you are, but I think it's a big distraction, the Islam.
[01:54:44.140 --> 01:54:45.442]  Okay, so we talked a year ago.
[01:54:47.588 --> 01:54:54.872]  Well, to me, if they'll bring in radical Muslims and let them kill us, it shows the globalists hate us, and don't want to bring in compatible people, and don't want to reform Islam.
[01:54:55.393 --> 01:54:57.794]  I mean, if Christians were running around doing this, I'd say don't do it.
[01:54:57.814 --> 01:55:00.816]  I mean, it's just out of control, but I wanted to make sure you were the same guy.
[01:55:00.856 --> 01:55:02.477]  Okay, so go ahead and make your new prediction.
[01:55:03.838 --> 01:55:08.541]  Yeah, I'm not talking about Muslims today, but, well, I can do.
[01:55:08.581 --> 01:55:10.862]  Yeah, so I phoned you in May of this year.
[01:55:11.743 --> 01:55:17.046]  It was just before the UK general election, and I said it was going to be a hung parliament, and nobody was
[01:55:17.816 --> 01:55:18.096]  I don't
[01:55:32.567 --> 01:55:38.149]  Well, I don't know.
[01:55:38.629 --> 01:55:40.869]  I mean, what's the evidence of them staging them?
[01:55:40.909 --> 01:55:46.511]  I mean, clearly they let the jihadis in, and then they attack, so it's staged one way or the other, because they knew who they were.
[01:55:46.551 --> 01:55:49.112]  Like this guy, the FBI tried to arrest him in 2015.
[01:55:49.292 --> 01:55:50.452]  They just attacked New York.
[01:55:50.732 --> 01:55:52.053]  But these are real jihadis.
[01:55:52.173 --> 01:55:56.494]  I get that governments order stand-downs so the terrorists can attack, but I mean,
[01:55:58.803 --> 01:56:08.769]  I would suggest that they... Why would Theresa May, why would they bring all the jihadis in, and then sit there and let them attack on top of it, when that makes them unpopular?
[01:56:08.909 --> 01:56:14.692]  I mean, I just don't under... I mean, if they're trying to prop up anti-Islamic governments, why don't they just get hardcore?
[01:56:14.712 --> 01:56:15.773]  That's popular to begin with.
[01:56:17.834 --> 01:56:20.836]  Well, the attackers are all so-called homegrown anyway.
[01:56:20.996 --> 01:56:23.077]  So, I mean, bringing them in is a bit of a red herring.
[01:56:23.097 --> 01:56:25.939]  But I was just putting... I was just pointing that out, because...
[01:56:28.784 --> 01:56:29.645]  That was also a prediction.
[01:56:29.665 --> 01:56:31.085]  Okay, well you're talking about some of your predictions.
[01:56:31.125 --> 01:56:32.046]  So what's your next prediction?
[01:56:32.086 --> 01:56:36.308]  Go ahead and get it out.
[01:56:36.368 --> 01:56:41.030]  Okay, so 31st of August this year, I put a bet on that Trump would be out of office within a year.
[01:56:42.090 --> 01:56:43.631]  And that's what I think is going to happen.
[01:56:44.612 --> 01:56:52.895]  And before then, he's going to take the United States and probably the UK into an enormous war with Iran.
[01:56:53.376 --> 01:56:55.997]  And Iran, and it's going to be Saudi Arabia and Israel.
[01:56:57.307 --> 01:57:08.452]  Which is an incredibly dangerous axis, playing along with the Trump administration on that part of the US government.
[01:57:09.333 --> 01:57:12.554]  And the North Korea thing is just an enormous smokescreen.
[01:57:12.594 --> 01:57:13.975]  Nothing's going to happen in North Korea.
[01:57:14.798 --> 01:57:19.982]  Because it's not in the establishment and globalist interest for anything to happen in North Korea.
[01:57:20.002 --> 01:57:21.603]  Alright, I find this intriguing.
[01:57:21.643 --> 01:57:22.043]  Stay there.
[01:57:22.063 --> 01:57:22.964]  I'm gonna go to break, Tom.
[01:57:22.984 --> 01:57:29.188]  And I want you to come back and walk through why Trump would walk into something, how they will remove him in this scenario.
[01:57:29.449 --> 01:57:31.930]  Because I agree, Saudi Arabia is lining up for war with Iran.
[01:57:32.891 --> 01:57:33.791]  Just briefly,
[01:58:03.556 --> 01:58:05.558]  My dad is an oral surgeon and dentist.
[01:58:05.578 --> 01:58:06.459]  He's about to retire.
[01:58:06.479 --> 01:58:13.444]  And about 15 years ago, he heard me ranting and raving about fluoride and toothpaste and how it causes brain damage and lower IQ and dental fluorosis.
[01:58:13.505 --> 01:58:16.587]  And he said, son, I don't care who you have on the air.
[01:58:16.607 --> 01:58:17.588]  That's a bunch of bull.
[01:58:18.108 --> 01:58:19.209]  You need fluoride or you die.
[01:58:19.750 --> 01:58:22.232]  And I actually showed him what was in the water supply and the fluoride.
[01:58:22.252 --> 01:58:23.033]  He said, this is incredible.
[01:58:23.453 --> 01:58:25.435]  This is Grignard Reagent's heavy metals.
[01:58:25.655 --> 01:58:31.360]  They're covering for it, calling it fluoride under law with a loophole to dump toxic waste in the food and water.
[01:58:31.940 --> 01:58:32.420]  Exactly.
[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:38.464]  Now, CNN had to admit last month, in utero and in children, massive IQ reductions.
[01:58:38.524 --> 01:58:42.307]  Well, six years ago, the EPA said, reduce it in water by half.
[01:58:43.667 --> 01:58:47.210]  You don't drink your sunscreen, but hydrofluorosilicic acid is a
[01:58:48.183 --> 01:58:48.783]  I don't know.
[01:59:04.930 --> 01:59:08.531]  The American Dental Association says don't brush children's teeth until age six with it.
[01:59:08.991 --> 01:59:11.632]  Why does it say nursery water than at the store with added fluoride?
[01:59:11.952 --> 01:59:14.413]  And they didn't add calcium fluoride, boys and girls.
[01:59:14.453 --> 01:59:16.414]  They added hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:59:16.614 --> 01:59:26.337]  That's why my dad and I developed, with the same folks that make Tom's of Maine, private labeled, Super Blue non-fluoride toothpaste with colloidal silver and high-quality iodine.
[01:59:26.937 --> 01:59:28.158]  But you die without iodine.
[01:59:28.178 --> 01:59:29.739]  Massive iodine deficiencies in the country.
[01:59:29.759 --> 01:59:31.520]  If you drink the stuff that's in the store, it'll kill you.
[01:59:31.560 --> 01:59:32.481]  That's a different type of iodine.
[01:59:32.521 --> 01:59:34.242]  This is the real medical grade.
[01:59:34.362 --> 01:59:42.648]  It's 33% off right now, and we have the bubble gum, natural flavor, organic flavor for children, that doesn't have as much of the peppermint in it, because it says concentrated toothpaste.
[01:59:43.268 --> 01:59:46.190]  Super Blue Toothpaste, available at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:59:57.025 --> 01:59:58.711]  You are receiving this transmission.
[01:59:58.731 --> 02:00:00.537]  You are the Resistance.
[02:00:21.957 --> 02:00:25.547]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:00:26.028 --> 02:00:27.853]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.807 --> 02:00:31.728]  American rebirth and renaissance.
[02:00:31.968 --> 02:00:34.068]  One year after the historic Trump victory.
[02:00:34.088 --> 02:00:38.229]  34-hour special live broadcast beginning tomorrow 8 a.m.
[02:00:39.089 --> 02:00:40.130]  Say what you want about Trump.
[02:00:40.670 --> 02:00:42.970]  Irrevocable damage to the globalist order.
[02:00:43.611 --> 02:00:45.831]  Major prosperity to the general population.
[02:00:46.671 --> 02:00:47.752]  Free market being promoted.
[02:00:47.772 --> 02:00:49.692]  Political correctness having its back broken.
[02:00:50.152 --> 02:00:51.793]  Nationalist movements launched globally.
[02:00:51.813 --> 02:00:52.993]  The EU imploding.
[02:00:54.386 --> 02:00:57.849]  But Phil Mudd and others at the CIA said they'd already have Trump out of office.
[02:00:58.369 --> 02:01:03.212]  Now they're telling people in DC, high-level Bush operatives, that Trump will be gone by December.
[02:01:03.773 --> 02:01:10.598]  Well, I think rumors of his demise have been greatly exaggerated, but I have remembered Tom in London calling with some accurate predictions.
[02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:13.081]  In the last two and a half years.
[02:01:13.561 --> 02:01:15.603]  And so, you got about four minutes here.
[02:01:16.164 --> 02:01:17.185]  Recap what you said.
[02:01:17.465 --> 02:01:18.486]  They are gearing up for war.
[02:01:19.366 --> 02:01:20.407]  Saudi Arabia with Iran.
[02:01:21.168 --> 02:01:26.472]  All this active war, this missile getting launched out of Yemen into there with that whole civil war.
[02:01:26.993 --> 02:01:29.435]  Give us your calculus and why you think this is the case.
[02:01:29.715 --> 02:01:32.117]  And are you saying Trump is a player in this?
[02:01:32.878 --> 02:01:36.020]  Because again, I'm not betting Trump is going to be gone in a year.
[02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:36.381]  Go ahead.
[02:01:38.536 --> 02:01:44.538]  Yeah, I mean, he certainly won't be gone by December, because he won't have done what he's supposed to do by then.
[02:01:46.099 --> 02:01:51.240]  The Iran thing, it's going to start with the usual thing.
[02:01:51.260 --> 02:01:52.461]  It's going to be a false flag.
[02:01:53.181 --> 02:01:55.822]  I mean, I think that's the only way that they can actually do it.
[02:01:57.442 --> 02:02:05.685]  And in Saudi Arabia, they're getting rid of... It's quite interesting that Israeli publications like Debka File,
[02:02:06.300 --> 02:02:11.381]  I'm pointing to what's going on in Saudi Arabia as getting rid of opposition to reforms.
[02:02:12.081 --> 02:02:18.383]  But what they're really doing is getting rid of opposition to Iranian aggression.
[02:02:18.843 --> 02:02:20.283]  No, I agree.
[02:02:20.323 --> 02:02:28.625]  That's why White House sources tell us that these were people that were soft on Iran and that that's why they're being arrested, not corruption.
[02:02:29.286 --> 02:02:30.906]  And they were also anti-Trump forces.
[02:02:32.626 --> 02:02:35.107]  They were blocking aggression against Iran.
[02:02:35.703 --> 02:02:46.770]  And now, you know, this is all being done very quickly, which indicates that what's going to actually happen is going to be in the fairly near future, maybe early next year.
[02:02:49.311 --> 02:02:52.373]  And also, they're bringing down the North Korea smoke screen.
[02:02:53.114 --> 02:03:00.799]  I mean, the North Korea was an important smoke screen, but this is now being sort of gradually being brought down, making way for the
[02:03:01.934 --> 02:03:04.656]  For the Iranian situation.
[02:03:05.057 --> 02:03:08.239]  But why would Trump allow... How are they going to get rid of Trump?
[02:03:08.760 --> 02:03:17.127]  Because, I mean, surely Iran and what we see with Saudi Arabia, Sunni versus Shiite, that's the ongoing big civil war.
[02:03:17.447 --> 02:03:18.288]  It is getting hotter.
[02:03:18.308 --> 02:03:19.509]  I mean, you're right there.
[02:03:19.529 --> 02:03:22.011]  I mean, I told people 15 years ago, Saudi Arabia has nukes.
[02:03:22.391 --> 02:03:23.152]  So does Iran.
[02:03:23.232 --> 02:03:24.053]  Now that's coming out.
[02:03:24.533 --> 02:03:29.057]  So a lot of this is known, but why would Trump be removed in the process after this?
[02:03:29.097 --> 02:03:30.118]  What's the calculus there?
[02:03:31.870 --> 02:03:35.676]  Well, there's not necessarily a connection there.
[02:03:35.696 --> 02:03:39.783]  I mean, that's part of the wider idea, the wider reason.
[02:03:41.987 --> 02:03:55.034]  Yeah, but Hillary and the top globalists in Soros funding her thought Trump was good because he'd lose in a general election and actually, you know, made him the focus early on because they don't know what they're doing.
[02:03:55.054 --> 02:03:56.054]  They're not unified.
[02:03:56.094 --> 02:03:58.316]  They're not one global elite now.
[02:03:58.436 --> 02:04:06.340]  It's fractured and there's major moves inside the establishment for prosperity and to get out of the eugenics-based depopulation plan.
[02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:10.502]  I mean, there's a real debate going on, brother, inside the power structure about that right now.
[02:04:12.279 --> 02:04:18.782]  I think they put up Hillary because they knew that she would lose.
[02:04:18.862 --> 02:04:22.143]  Let me ask you this, do you think Trump, why would they want to get rid of Trump?
[02:04:25.525 --> 02:04:28.966]  They want to get rid of Trump in disgrace, sort of thing.
[02:04:29.667 --> 02:04:36.590]  But do you think Trump knows that, sure, to repudiate nationalism, create a global depression or something, like they did in 29 to blame nationalism?
[02:04:37.990 --> 02:04:39.511]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:04:39.531 --> 02:04:41.392]  We're not going to put up with that, it's not going to happen.
[02:04:42.307 --> 02:04:47.731]  So we're aware of a lot of what's going on, and you are right, they're gearing up for war between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
[02:04:48.732 --> 02:04:52.735]  But again, we'll see what ends up unfolding.
[02:04:53.176 --> 02:04:59.621]  I don't think Trump, who in many ways is a joker in a good way, wants to be somebody else's man.
[02:05:00.542 --> 02:05:02.143]  I think the globalists are in deep trouble.
[02:05:03.845 --> 02:05:05.267]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:05:05.307 --> 02:05:06.388]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:05:06.648 --> 02:05:07.569]  Why is this so good?
[02:05:07.849 --> 02:05:13.093]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:05:13.173 --> 02:05:26.724]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:05:26.784 --> 02:05:28.166]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:05:28.926 --> 02:05:30.507]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[02:05:30.587 --> 02:05:33.089]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:05:33.169 --> 02:05:34.430]  These are all parasites.
[02:05:34.490 --> 02:05:35.571]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:05:35.591 --> 02:05:36.632]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:05:36.952 --> 02:05:41.275]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:05:41.476 --> 02:05:44.658]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:05:44.718 --> 02:05:47.801]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:05:47.841 --> 02:05:48.842]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:05:48.882 --> 02:05:50.784]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[02:05:50.844 --> 02:05:51.865]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:05:51.885 --> 02:05:53.947]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:05:54.568 --> 02:05:57.590]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[02:05:57.871 --> 02:05:59.773]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:06:00.133 --> 02:06:02.095]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:06:09.758 --> 02:06:13.722]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:06:15.303 --> 02:06:18.005]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:18.366 --> 02:06:22.009]  Time keeps on slipping, slipping
[02:07:00.367 --> 02:07:04.970]  We had a caller earlier who's been calling for two and a half, three years, and he's made some predictions that came true.
[02:07:04.990 --> 02:07:09.372]  I mean, I predicted Trump was going to win the nomination to win the presidency, too.
[02:07:10.113 --> 02:07:13.835]  So it doesn't mean that everything I predict comes true, but he thinks after a big Iran,
[02:07:15.603 --> 02:07:17.024]  Well, I don't think Trump wants to go along with that.
[02:07:17.044 --> 02:07:18.584]  Clearly, the globalists are thinking about that.
[02:07:18.665 --> 02:07:19.505]  Clearly, they're pushing that.
[02:07:30.333 --> 02:07:34.978]  We're gonna go to your phone calls right now and then coming up I've got some really amazing clips I want to get to.
[02:07:35.018 --> 02:07:40.204]  A congressman gets really rattled by a woman exposing some key issues we're gonna get to.
[02:07:40.224 --> 02:07:45.289]  We've got more on what happened in Texas and of course we're taking your phone calls right now.
[02:07:46.070 --> 02:07:50.135]  We're about to go to Tal, Alyssa, Zach and Mark.
[02:07:52.483 --> 02:07:59.045]  But we are seeing the globalists trying to destroy discredit nationalism, but they're being irrevocably damaged.
[02:07:59.825 --> 02:08:21.632]  And the authoritarian nature and unelected nature and anti-free market and anti-prosperity nature, ethos, worldview of the New World Order is so anti-human and so bad and so villainous, they may have some delusional plan to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, but it isn't happening.
[02:08:23.527 --> 02:08:27.772]  The move against globalism, the move to decentralize, has always been happening.
[02:08:28.252 --> 02:08:29.453]  And now it's accelerating.
[02:08:31.756 --> 02:08:35.220]  The best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[02:08:37.142 --> 02:08:43.449]  And these globalists have the same disease of authoritarians, where they become megalomaniacs and they believe they're invincible.
[02:08:44.798 --> 02:08:52.221]  I know so many people who make a couple hundred thousand dollars a year that go from being a normal person making $50,000 a year to being crazy and believing they're invincible.
[02:08:52.841 --> 02:08:55.162]  I know folks that become movie stars and go crazy.
[02:08:55.722 --> 02:08:57.963]  I mean, most people get power, they go nuts.
[02:08:57.983 --> 02:09:02.645]  You know, they made a bunch of documentaries and books where most people, like 95% or more,
[02:09:04.966 --> 02:09:08.829]  It's almost 100% that win $50 million, $100 million, $200 million in a lottery.
[02:09:09.289 --> 02:09:13.733]  It destroys their life, their children, them, within two years.
[02:09:14.113 --> 02:09:15.774]  They're dead or in prison or bankrupt.
[02:09:17.255 --> 02:09:20.338]  And the globalists are the same way.
[02:09:20.478 --> 02:09:22.479]  I mean, they are just out of control.
[02:09:23.260 --> 02:09:33.107]  And once they don't have the public's support, once the public's not in a trance, once the public's awake, once the public knows that the social contract has been violated,
[02:09:34.249 --> 02:09:40.442]  We will form a new social contract together for prosperity that removes them from the equation entirely.
[02:09:40.522 --> 02:09:43.649]  And if they want a war, they'll get one of those too!
[02:09:46.186 --> 02:09:52.250]  Imagine all the little mindless devil worshippers scumbags that feel like they're part of the power structure with the professors and everybody.
[02:09:52.290 --> 02:09:57.714]  And now the Christians and folks they hate, that they look down on, aren't being their intellectual slaves anymore.
[02:09:57.914 --> 02:10:02.077]  So they think they'll go kill some people at some churches and stuff to whip us back into support.
[02:10:02.418 --> 02:10:05.220]  We see right through you, you little punks.
[02:10:13.185 --> 02:10:15.027]  Insecure pedophiles.
[02:10:16.288 --> 02:10:18.289]  Who don't want a relationship with a full-grown woman.
[02:10:20.769 --> 02:10:21.870]  They're attracted to little kids.
[02:10:23.250 --> 02:10:24.710]  Turns out Kelly was a pedophile.
[02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:25.711]  Of course he was!
[02:10:26.691 --> 02:10:28.031]  Got a pedophile problem.
[02:10:28.411 --> 02:10:29.912]  Got a devil worshipper problem.
[02:10:30.832 --> 02:10:31.892]  Got a punk problem.
[02:10:32.833 --> 02:10:34.233]  They think they're smarter than everybody.
[02:10:34.573 --> 02:10:35.233]  They're lazy.
[02:10:35.553 --> 02:10:36.234]  They're stupid.
[02:10:36.514 --> 02:10:37.814]  They're video game TV heads.
[02:10:37.874 --> 02:10:38.934]  It's always the same M.O.
[02:10:39.375 --> 02:10:40.435]  They're always on drugs.
[02:10:41.377 --> 02:10:44.319]  And they want to do something nasty and big to be manly.
[02:10:44.759 --> 02:10:50.063]  Waddle in, you know, 100 pounds overweight in his little black tactical uniform and shoot some women.
[02:10:50.963 --> 02:10:54.305]  He didn't go join a boxing class or jiu-jitsu class.
[02:10:54.606 --> 02:10:56.967]  He didn't go actually become a medic in the military.
[02:10:57.207 --> 02:10:57.567]  He didn't know.
[02:10:57.608 --> 02:11:03.571]  He just went around and beat up his girlfriend and his wife and beat up his stepkids because he was a punk!
[02:11:03.792 --> 02:11:05.993]  Because he needed to have his teeth knocked out!
[02:11:06.013 --> 02:11:08.875]  He needed to have his brain stomped out!
[02:11:09.940 --> 02:11:15.443]  But see, today, we let these punks just walk around, don't we?
[02:11:15.463 --> 02:11:21.027]  Next time I see one of these little devil whispers pushing somebody around, I'm going to go ahead and do what's right.
[02:11:21.047 --> 02:11:26.250]  I'm going to go ahead and ask them if they're looking for a fight.
[02:11:26.891 --> 02:11:28.452]  Why don't they go ahead and get one right now?
[02:11:29.352 --> 02:11:30.753]  See, they always want to creep off.
[02:11:30.913 --> 02:11:34.776]  It's always about how they're in charge, how they're going to have it on their time.
[02:11:35.016 --> 02:11:37.177]  They're going to become a professor and corrupt your children.
[02:11:37.858 --> 02:11:38.138]  Look at him.
[02:11:39.025 --> 02:11:42.166]  He wants little girls because he's intimidated by women.
[02:11:44.326 --> 02:11:49.448]  He doesn't see beautiful, sexy, full-grown women and all their strength and everything and want that.
[02:11:49.468 --> 02:11:52.708]  Because he didn't know how to tell a joke.
[02:11:52.828 --> 02:11:53.689]  He didn't know how to have fun.
[02:11:53.909 --> 02:11:59.370]  He didn't know how to... He just knows how to act like a little devil worshipper pedophile!
[02:12:00.330 --> 02:12:03.111]  He knows how to waddle into a church and kill a bunch of men, women, and children.
[02:12:03.331 --> 02:12:04.911]  He's a real tough guy.
[02:12:05.071 --> 02:12:06.532]  Well, you know what, you little bastard?
[02:12:06.732 --> 02:12:07.592]  You're dead now.
[02:12:09.775 --> 02:12:16.941]  You got your permission from Antifa, the media, to go out, yeah, your mother-in-law's there, and they're a bunch of Christians, and you hate them, and you're a big leftist.
[02:12:17.302 --> 02:12:18.202]  Antifa, you know what?
[02:12:18.503 --> 02:12:20.044]  You'll kill two birds with one stone.
[02:12:20.064 --> 02:12:21.926]  You've got permission to be a sack of crap.
[02:12:22.646 --> 02:12:27.751]  You're gonna go in there and kill a bunch of people, but oh, did you drop your gun and run once you got shot in the leg and the stomach?
[02:12:28.231 --> 02:12:33.676]  Pee-peeing on yourself, they reportedly going, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!
[02:12:33.856 --> 02:12:36.819]  What are you, bled out on the side of the highway, you little coward?
[02:12:38.376 --> 02:12:40.497]  Tal of South Carolina, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:12:41.017 --> 02:12:41.377]  Welcome.
[02:12:42.837 --> 02:12:44.018]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[02:12:44.218 --> 02:12:46.438]  Good, brother.
[02:12:46.619 --> 02:12:47.979]  I want to make two points.
[02:12:48.839 --> 02:12:58.542]  I know how it is being a radio show host myself in the past, so I know a lot of people are waiting, but first of all, I want to talk about the Uranium One victim.
[02:12:59.743 --> 02:13:07.385]  These are people that Hillary Clinton has directly affected with her Russian deal, such as the ranchers out in Oregon.
[02:13:07.975 --> 02:13:09.137]  I don't know.
[02:13:21.620 --> 02:13:22.241]  I didn't know that.
[02:13:22.261 --> 02:13:29.327]  I thought they stood up against a bunch of land grabs that Trump's now reversing on land that they had the surface rights to since 1877.
[02:13:29.607 --> 02:13:34.672]  The dumb liberal public's like, how do you have the right to the top if you don't own it?
[02:13:34.932 --> 02:13:35.813]  Total morons.
[02:13:36.394 --> 02:13:36.854]  And I didn't know.
[02:13:36.894 --> 02:13:43.300]  I mean, I know they found the Communist Chinese were going to use them as an easement for their scam with Harry Reid, who's now gone.
[02:13:43.320 --> 02:13:46.162]  But no, tell me about it.
[02:13:47.290 --> 02:13:49.052]  Uh, Harry Reid definitely wants their land.
[02:13:49.192 --> 02:13:52.616]  His son, Roy, wants their land for the solar farm next door to it.
[02:13:53.276 --> 02:13:59.523]  Now that was confirmed, and then the media played games and went, oh, this, it was going to be an easement, not the solar farm.
[02:13:59.623 --> 02:14:00.244]  Alex was wrong.
[02:14:00.584 --> 02:14:02.246]  It's the same thing as the solar farm.
[02:14:02.286 --> 02:14:04.168]  I said an easement for the solar farm.
[02:14:04.188 --> 02:14:04.568]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:14:05.569 --> 02:14:05.830]  Yes.
[02:14:05.990 --> 02:14:09.894]  Well, uh, you do know the Hammonds, uh, their, their uranium
[02:14:11.955 --> 02:14:18.121]  You know, I knew that some of the uranium was out there in Oregon.
[02:14:18.221 --> 02:14:19.042]  I didn't know that.
[02:14:19.122 --> 02:14:20.343]  Wow, is that even in the news?
[02:14:21.404 --> 02:14:22.305]  No, it is not.
[02:14:22.365 --> 02:14:27.190]  But that is part of what the bunnies uncovered when they went and occupied the Malheur Refuge last year.
[02:14:27.670 --> 02:14:33.096]  And that's probably why they're being demonized now, and Mr. LaVoy Finnegan was shot and murdered by the FBI.
[02:14:34.605 --> 02:14:35.626]  They're using the B.O.M.
[02:14:35.686 --> 02:14:38.127]  as their Nazi Gestapo, for that matter.
[02:14:38.928 --> 02:14:41.869]  I know, they're even indicting the people that were involved shooting them.
[02:14:41.889 --> 02:14:42.830]  That is just crazy.
[02:14:43.550 --> 02:14:44.711]  Wow, I'll look into that.
[02:14:45.271 --> 02:14:46.812]  What else do you think about what's going on in the world?
[02:14:48.093 --> 02:14:50.774]  Well, the Texas church shooting, the false flag attack.
[02:14:51.335 --> 02:14:54.957]  You know, every time that the Communist Democrats have
[02:14:55.470 --> 02:15:01.491]  One of their treasonous activities exposed, there's always a false flag attack that happens in the United States to get our attention off of it.
[02:15:01.571 --> 02:15:08.553]  I've noticed every time the Uranium One deal comes out, every time they get caught with the Donna Brazile stuff, they just magically, one of the little demons, you know, goes and kills some people.
[02:15:08.833 --> 02:15:11.554]  And it never matters that he's admittedly Antifa.
[02:15:11.594 --> 02:15:13.354]  They just say, oh, there's no connection.
[02:15:14.434 --> 02:15:19.736]  He attacked Christians, he's wearing black, he's set on his own LinkedIn, he loves Antifa, and hates Christians.
[02:15:19.756 --> 02:15:20.396]  There you go!
[02:15:20.416 --> 02:15:24.717]  I hate Christians, he says, and goes and kills them, and they ask what the motive is.
[02:15:25.851 --> 02:15:26.271]  That's right.
[02:15:43.627 --> 02:15:52.614]  Well, that's the good news, Tal, is you're awake, I'm awake, and we're never going back under their spell again.
[02:15:52.654 --> 02:15:53.094]  God bless you.
[02:15:53.114 --> 02:15:53.695]  Keep spreading the word.
[02:15:53.755 --> 02:15:54.075]  I love you.
[02:15:54.095 --> 02:15:55.476]  That's a great caller.
[02:15:55.516 --> 02:15:58.619]  Alyssa, Zach, Mark, and others, your calls are only a few minutes away.
[02:15:58.639 --> 02:16:00.680]  I'm going right to you on the other side.
[02:16:00.760 --> 02:16:01.321]  InfoWars.
[02:16:11.668 --> 02:16:12.169]  Just briefly,
[02:16:13.391 --> 02:16:15.392]  My dad is an oral surgeon and dentist.
[02:16:15.412 --> 02:16:16.293]  He's about to retire.
[02:16:16.313 --> 02:16:23.258]  And about 15 years ago, he heard me ranting and raving about fluoride and toothpaste and how it causes brain damage and lower IQ and dental fluorosis.
[02:16:23.338 --> 02:16:26.400]  And he said, son, I don't care who you have on the air.
[02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:27.420]  That's a bunch of bull.
[02:16:27.941 --> 02:16:29.022]  You need fluoride or you die.
[02:16:29.582 --> 02:16:32.024]  And I actually showed him what was in the water supply and the fluoride.
[02:16:32.044 --> 02:16:32.864]  He said, this is incredible.
[02:16:33.264 --> 02:16:35.266]  This is Grignard Reagents Heavy Metals.
[02:16:35.486 --> 02:16:41.190]  They're covering for it, calling it fluoride under law with a loophole to dump toxic waste in the food and water.
[02:16:41.790 --> 02:16:42.251]  Exactly.
[02:16:42.311 --> 02:16:48.299]  Now, CNN had to admit last month, in utero and in children, massive IQ reductions.
[02:16:48.359 --> 02:16:52.144]  Well, six years ago, the EPA said reduce it in water by half.
[02:16:53.506 --> 02:16:57.030]  You don't drink your sunscreen, but hydrofluorosilicic acid is a
[02:16:58.112 --> 02:17:00.253]  Copped up version of fluoride.
[02:17:00.433 --> 02:17:01.454]  It's been turned into an acid.
[02:17:01.974 --> 02:17:02.735]  It's an adjuvant.
[02:17:02.795 --> 02:17:03.475]  It's very toxic.
[02:17:03.816 --> 02:17:12.381]  But there is the CNN headline that fluoride in the water and in toothpaste is causing IQs to drop precipitously.
[02:17:12.721 --> 02:17:13.822]  And for seven years the
[02:17:14.773 --> 02:17:18.374]  The American Dental Association says don't brush children's teeth until age 6 with it.
[02:17:18.814 --> 02:17:21.275]  Why does it say nursery water than at the store with added fluoride?
[02:17:21.335 --> 02:17:24.236]  And they didn't add calcium fluoride, boys and girls.
[02:17:24.276 --> 02:17:26.257]  They added hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:17:26.457 --> 02:17:36.200]  That's why my dad and I developed, with the same folks that make Toms of Maine, it's private-labeled, Super Blue non-fluoride toothpaste with colloidal silver and high-quality iodine.
[02:17:36.760 --> 02:17:38.000]  But you die without iodine.
[02:17:38.020 --> 02:17:39.561]  Massive iodine deficiencies in the country.
[02:17:39.581 --> 02:17:41.361]  If you drink the stuff that's at the store, it'll kill you.
[02:17:41.401 --> 02:17:42.342]  That's a different type of iodine.
[02:17:42.362 --> 02:17:43.762]  This is the real medical grade.
[02:17:44.202 --> 02:17:52.492]  It's 33% off right now, and we have the bubble gum, natural flavor, organic flavor for children, that doesn't have as much of the peppermint in it, because it says concentrated toothpaste.
[02:17:53.093 --> 02:17:56.397]  Super Blue Toothpaste, available at InfoWarsTore.com!
[02:18:09.210 --> 02:18:16.232]  We're not going to stoop to the tactics of this authoritarian communist and fascist, funded by that dirtbag George Soros.
[02:18:16.492 --> 02:18:18.973]  The communists, they can't resist free stuff.
[02:18:19.493 --> 02:18:22.674]  Instead of a booth, it says free stuff.
[02:18:23.034 --> 02:18:29.036]  We're going to keep our Constitution, our Bill of Rights, and the American way, but at the same time, we're not going to back down from
[02:18:37.517 --> 02:18:39.998]  What do I do if one of these libtards calls me a Nazi?
[02:18:40.679 --> 02:18:41.179]  That's easy.
[02:18:41.219 --> 02:18:42.720]  You just put a pacifier in his mouth.
[02:18:46.202 --> 02:18:51.244]  Here's what I'm gonna do.
[02:18:51.684 --> 02:18:53.305]  One of these Antifa's get in my face.
[02:18:53.325 --> 02:18:58.848]  I'm gonna pull out my pocket constitution and stick it in his.
[02:19:02.210 --> 02:19:02.850]  Antifa?
[02:19:03.511 --> 02:19:04.131]  Never heard of him.
[02:19:05.788 --> 02:19:06.529]  Never heard of the guy.
[02:19:07.270 --> 02:19:09.672]  They're gonna lose on November 4th and every day after that.
[02:19:09.693 --> 02:19:12.496]  Because they're a bunch of meth-head pieces of crap.
[02:19:13.076 --> 02:19:18.402]  Dude, that's French for p***y. Holding our ground and not letting these bullies push us around.
[02:19:19.083 --> 02:19:20.445]  But, not stooping to their level.
[02:19:21.527 --> 02:19:24.528]  I'm gonna grab and buy the antifa.
[02:19:24.568 --> 02:19:26.649]  So on November 4th, we gotta do a thing.
[02:19:27.489 --> 02:19:27.729]  A thing?
[02:19:27.750 --> 02:19:28.790]  Yeah, we're gonna do a thing.
[02:19:29.250 --> 02:19:32.171]  America is an information-based civil war.
[02:19:32.551 --> 02:19:34.312]  We're winning that war thanks to you.
[02:19:34.832 --> 02:19:39.954]  And wearing t-shirts and InfoWars ball caps in public is one of the best ways to spread the word.
[02:19:40.275 --> 02:19:43.336]  The revolution starts now with you at InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:20:06.007 --> 02:20:08.648]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:24.199 --> 02:20:26.321]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:20:26.801 --> 02:20:28.162]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:29.143 --> 02:20:37.348]  Netflix has got a new TV show coming out praising the communist revolution kicking off in 1917 right through the 30s.
[02:20:37.849 --> 02:20:40.310]  How wonderful it was mass murdering everyone.
[02:20:41.731 --> 02:20:48.596]  The media goes, Jones is crazy claiming Antifa's planning an uprising and that it's coordinated with the 100th anniversary.
[02:20:48.937 --> 02:20:50.338]  That's on their websites.
[02:20:50.418 --> 02:20:51.639]  It's in full-page ads.
[02:20:52.139 --> 02:20:54.541]  They've been trying to attack the White House last night.
[02:20:56.062 --> 02:21:00.605]  Attacking Rand Paul, attacking the church, attacking... You're seeing the attacks.
[02:21:03.007 --> 02:21:04.288]  It's called the Russian Revolution.
[02:21:05.834 --> 02:21:11.377]  We've got a breakdown of that that Gavin Wentz put together coming up in the next segment, and I've got some other powerful videos.
[02:21:11.397 --> 02:21:12.738]  But right now, let's go to your calls.
[02:21:13.379 --> 02:21:14.719]  Let's go to Alyssa in Oregon.
[02:21:14.739 --> 02:21:15.860]  Thank you for holding patiently.
[02:21:15.880 --> 02:21:18.322]  Hi, Alex.
[02:21:18.782 --> 02:21:20.643]  It's an honor to be on the phone with you again.
[02:21:20.903 --> 02:21:21.303]  Thank you.
[02:21:22.444 --> 02:21:25.346]  I got one quick little suggestion before I get into my question.
[02:21:26.987 --> 02:21:35.352]  My little brother, he has autism, and because of, you know, his problems from the vaccinations, he has a lot of food allergies.
[02:21:36.343 --> 02:21:36.784]  I think so.
[02:21:54.069 --> 02:21:54.789]  That's a great point.
[02:21:54.829 --> 02:22:01.575]  We should come out with a variant that doesn't have basically whey products in it for people that have a lactose intolerance.
[02:22:01.615 --> 02:22:02.235]  That's a great idea.
[02:22:02.495 --> 02:22:09.561]  We're expanding the entire InfoWars Life brand so that we can obviously fund our operation and help people have better lives.
[02:22:09.661 --> 02:22:10.542]  So a 360 win.
[02:22:10.882 --> 02:22:11.903]  But that is a great point.
[02:22:11.963 --> 02:22:13.144]  We will try to work on that.
[02:22:14.565 --> 02:22:15.846]  Okay, now for my question.
[02:22:17.777 --> 02:22:27.423]  Ever since you had that pastor on, you know, I remembered about a man I'd heard about during the election, a retired firefighter named Mark Taylor.
[02:22:27.483 --> 02:22:28.664]  I don't know if you've ever heard of him.
[02:22:28.684 --> 02:22:31.426]  I'll look it up.
[02:22:31.506 --> 02:22:33.367]  I may have, but I may have forgotten.
[02:22:33.427 --> 02:22:34.047]  I may have forgotten.
[02:22:34.147 --> 02:22:34.808]  Mark Pear?
[02:22:35.869 --> 02:22:36.689]  Mark Taylor.
[02:22:36.709 --> 02:22:43.774]  He says that God showed him in 2011 that Donald Trump would become President of the United States.
[02:22:45.040 --> 02:22:49.462]  Naturally skeptical about this, you know, there's a lot of... Did you find the original timestamp video?
[02:22:51.023 --> 02:22:59.928]  Uh, I actually saw the video in April 28th of... or no, sorry, excuse me, April 18th of 2016.
[02:23:00.648 --> 02:23:09.453]  Uh, that was his first interview, um, basically detailing pretty much how the entire election was going to go down and it pretty much happened exactly how he said.
[02:23:09.473 --> 02:23:14.095]  He also talked about, um, how Trump was going to pick five
[02:23:14.580 --> 02:23:16.782]  Alright, well thank you Alyssa.
[02:23:16.822 --> 02:23:18.284]  I'll have to look into that.
[02:23:18.304 --> 02:23:18.484]  Thank you.
[02:23:18.504 --> 02:23:18.965]  We'll look into that.
[02:23:18.985 --> 02:23:19.685]  Thank you very much.
[02:23:32.597 --> 02:23:45.486]  By the way, coming up in the next segment, I'm going to play the clip of Trump, hours after the Texas shooting, saying we have a lot of mental problems in America, and they're getting worse because of the culture, and the drugs, and the TV, and, I mean, just all of it's contributing to the breakdown of society.
[02:23:47.127 --> 02:23:50.190]  Church government escaped from mental hospital in 2012.
[02:23:50.690 --> 02:23:55.954]  I mean, this guy was a mess, but of course he was a liberal.
[02:23:57.902 --> 02:24:01.106]  Here is the president predicting it and being proven correct.
[02:24:01.146 --> 02:24:01.506]  Here it is.
[02:24:02.928 --> 02:24:08.334]  The problem here, this was a very, based on preliminary reports, very deranged individual.
[02:24:08.354 --> 02:24:10.597]  A lot of problems over a long period of time.
[02:24:11.598 --> 02:24:15.642]  We have a lot of mental health problems in our country as do other countries.
[02:24:16.563 --> 02:24:20.565]  But this isn't a guns situation.
[02:24:20.645 --> 02:24:23.626]  I mean, we could go into it, but it's a little bit soon to go into it.
[02:24:23.746 --> 02:24:27.728]  But fortunately, somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction.
[02:24:27.808 --> 02:24:29.589]  Otherwise, it would have been as bad as it was.
[02:24:29.609 --> 02:24:30.629]  It would have been much worse.
[02:24:31.790 --> 02:24:36.272]  But this is a mental health problem at the highest level.
[02:24:37.472 --> 02:24:39.213]  It's a very, very sad event.
[02:24:39.834 --> 02:24:42.835]  These are great people and a very, very sad event.
[02:24:43.355 --> 02:24:44.576]  But that's the way I view it.
[02:24:45.438 --> 02:24:54.285]  But the media said Trump was wrong and horrible, but oh, here it is, now being reported by ABC News, CBS News, KHOU.
[02:24:54.805 --> 02:24:57.267]  Out of Houston, church gunman escaped from mental hospital.
[02:24:57.807 --> 02:25:10.317]  In 2012, the gunman who killed 26 people in South Texas Church Sunday escaped from a mental health facility in New Mexico in 2012, according to documents obtained by KHOU11 News.
[02:25:10.977 --> 02:25:12.939]  Devin Kelly was sent to the park
[02:25:14.107 --> 02:25:22.270]  Behavioral Health Services Center in Santa Teresa, New Mexico after beating his wife and child while stationed at Holloman Air Force Base.
[02:25:23.710 --> 02:25:26.011]  Should have just gone to prison and got his ass kicked.
[02:25:27.151 --> 02:25:28.052]  These punks never do.
[02:25:28.812 --> 02:25:33.394]  On June 13, 2012, Kelly escaped from the center and fled across the state line to El Paso.
[02:25:34.194 --> 02:25:42.917]  In the missing person report, Kelly was described as a danger to himself and others and had already been caught sneaking firearms onto Holloman Air Force Base.
[02:25:44.704 --> 02:25:49.705]  But, the Air Force didn't transfer the disarmable discharge to the FBI database.
[02:25:51.385 --> 02:25:54.066]  The report said Kelly was attempting to carry out death threats.
[02:25:56.567 --> 02:25:56.867]  Man!
[02:25:57.947 --> 02:25:59.527]  Lock his butt up, man!
[02:26:01.568 --> 02:26:04.088]  He made on the military chain of command.
[02:26:04.708 --> 02:26:06.749]  He's threatening to kill the chain of command, all of it.
[02:26:06.769 --> 02:26:08.149]  He escapes from mental institution.
[02:26:09.269 --> 02:26:11.970]  I think that gives you about 10 years in a supermax right there.
[02:26:13.516 --> 02:26:16.019]  I mean, it's always mental patients.
[02:26:16.059 --> 02:26:16.980]  We know they're coming.
[02:26:17.380 --> 02:26:18.622]  No one's going after them.
[02:26:18.662 --> 02:26:19.783]  They let them get the weapons.
[02:26:20.163 --> 02:26:21.084]  And then they blame us!
[02:26:21.885 --> 02:26:22.165]  No!
[02:26:22.306 --> 02:26:24.188]  I will not be blamed for this scumbag!
[02:26:24.508 --> 02:26:30.855]  I will not collectively take the guilt of hundreds of millions killed by communists and authoritarians in countries where they had no guns!
[02:26:34.326 --> 02:26:44.116]  But here is Cuomo refuting the mental illness statement of the president, proving what a complete congenital liar or moron, or both, he is.
[02:26:44.156 --> 02:26:45.838]  Here it is.
[02:26:46.038 --> 02:26:49.602]  For all the talk about mental illness as the key, studies show the U.S.
[02:26:49.622 --> 02:26:56.690]  doesn't have more mental illness than anywhere else, but we do have 25 times the rate of gun murder.
[02:26:58.250 --> 02:26:59.211]  25 times.
[02:26:59.851 --> 02:27:03.932]  Americans own more guns per capita than any other country.
[02:27:04.252 --> 02:27:10.414]  In fact, half of all civilian-owned guns in the world are owned by Americans.
[02:27:11.034 --> 02:27:17.236]  America has more mass shootings than any other country in the world.
[02:27:17.416 --> 02:27:18.296]  We own more guns.
[02:27:18.676 --> 02:27:20.217]  We have more mass shootings.
[02:27:20.537 --> 02:27:21.657]  What are we going to do about it?
[02:27:22.489 --> 02:27:23.830]  Oh, well, get rid of your bodyguards?
[02:27:24.070 --> 02:27:24.311]  No.
[02:27:24.871 --> 02:27:28.274]  But England has, what, 15 times the knife attacks we do because they don't have guns.
[02:27:28.734 --> 02:27:33.278]  Yes, it's true that per capita for any free country we have the highest rate of gun crime.
[02:27:34.500 --> 02:27:37.661]  But if you then look at all the other crime statistics, many of them are lower.
[02:27:38.321 --> 02:27:39.602]  So again, it's all distorted.
[02:27:39.702 --> 02:27:44.563]  Overall, crime using guns is down 61% FBI statistics since 1992.
[02:27:44.803 --> 02:27:48.524]  What they do is hype up the mass shootings to create the perception.
[02:27:48.905 --> 02:27:53.306]  But the statistics are up this year from last year, if you count Mandalay Bay and now this event.
[02:27:53.686 --> 02:27:56.467]  And of course, a lot of this is leftists pulling off false flags.
[02:27:56.987 --> 02:27:58.908]  I believe to demonize the Second Amendment.
[02:27:59.128 --> 02:28:01.248]  They certainly fit the entire MO.
[02:28:01.609 --> 02:28:02.789]  But there is the president!
[02:28:05.796 --> 02:28:08.357]  There is President Trump completely vindicated.
[02:28:09.117 --> 02:28:27.805]  It now turns out, breaking, if you just tuned in, that the shooter from Texas in the mass murder at the church, Mr. Devin Kelly, escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 after the military put him there for trying to bring guns on base to kill his chain of command.
[02:28:29.141 --> 02:28:35.678]  for punishing him for attacking his wife and stepchild and that he was trying to bring weapons on to kill them.
[02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:37.423]  What did the Air Force do?
[02:28:38.649 --> 02:28:48.612]  Well, I guess they covered it up because they never transferred the information to the FBI NICS system so that he couldn't get guns via his dishonorable discharge and he was able to get them.
[02:28:49.273 --> 02:28:59.276]  So we need to find out who in his chain of command dropped the ball and they need to be standing tall before the man and have their butts court-martialed and thrown in prison because they are partially responsible!
[02:29:02.776 --> 02:29:07.100]  We're very proud of the fact here at InfoWars that we're a teleprompter-free operation.
[02:29:07.560 --> 02:29:12.605]  We don't get our talking points from the private Federal Reserve or from Nazi collaborators like George Soros.
[02:29:13.145 --> 02:29:17.069]  We get our talking points from common sense and research from we the people.
[02:29:17.089 --> 02:29:20.412]  That means our guests, our researchers, you the listeners, the callers.
[02:29:21.072 --> 02:29:25.516]  But that said, today I've got a script I'm going to follow for the first time ever.
[02:29:26.157 --> 02:29:29.400]  It's you the listeners, the viewers, that wrote my talking points.
[02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:39.623]  I came in here an hour ago, and I literally just went to Infowarsstore.com and printed the five-star reviews, the first few pages.
[02:29:39.923 --> 02:29:43.724]  These are in the order of how they've been posted by you, the listeners.
[02:29:44.325 --> 02:29:47.786]  And it's five-star, after five-star, after five-star.
[02:29:48.146 --> 02:29:49.846]  It's amazing, from third-party sites.
[02:29:50.307 --> 02:29:56.629]  So, this is what you, the listeners and viewers, have to say about the products at Infowarslife.com.
[02:29:56.669 --> 02:29:57.569]  Let's go over them right now.
[02:29:58.129 --> 02:29:59.630]  This is Verified Buyer Mark.
[02:29:59.830 --> 02:30:02.773]  Five-star review for Anthroplex for men and women.
[02:30:03.253 --> 02:30:04.274]  I take it as directed.
[02:30:04.294 --> 02:30:15.202]  As one uses it too much, it will cause reflections of adolescent years and skin and muscle and hair growth will of course increase sex drive as a given.
[02:30:15.763 --> 02:30:16.443]  Easy does it.
[02:30:16.523 --> 02:30:17.544]  Yeah, it's hardcore.
[02:30:17.564 --> 02:30:18.505]  It's very, very serious.
[02:30:18.925 --> 02:30:19.325]  Not a game.
[02:30:19.365 --> 02:30:19.766]  Thank you, Mark.
[02:30:20.286 --> 02:30:21.567]  Here's another one from Patrick.
[02:30:21.707 --> 02:30:22.507]  Energy all day.
[02:30:22.947 --> 02:30:30.231]  I use this along with Supermail and it makes me have driving energy all day on my 12 to 14 hour day.
[02:30:30.671 --> 02:30:31.372]  Another review.
[02:30:31.392 --> 02:30:32.392]  I love this one.
[02:30:32.692 --> 02:30:35.133]  Keeps my husband going and going and going.
[02:30:35.514 --> 02:30:39.035]  This must be the stuff the Energizer Bunny is on.
[02:30:39.315 --> 02:30:42.237]  I guess that's some fine lady using her husband Adam's account.
[02:30:42.617 --> 02:30:44.139]  Here's another one ladies and gentlemen.
[02:30:44.540 --> 02:30:47.905]  Five star review for Winter Sun Vitamin D3.
[02:30:48.185 --> 02:30:51.370]  This product is amazing and will keep you from the winter blues.
[02:30:51.430 --> 02:30:52.131]  I don't get sick.
[02:30:52.812 --> 02:30:56.157]  Last winter while I was taking this for the first time in my life.
[02:30:56.297 --> 02:30:57.258]  Amazing product.
[02:30:57.999 --> 02:31:00.080]  Again, tastes good as well, they say.
[02:31:00.500 --> 02:31:01.500]  Here's one from Brian.
[02:31:01.821 --> 02:31:03.901]  I love this product and I live in Wisconsin.
[02:31:04.021 --> 02:31:04.862]  Thank you all.
[02:31:05.262 --> 02:31:08.903]  It's time that we turn the clocks back and lose the sunshine.
[02:31:08.983 --> 02:31:11.184]  I love this product and I am a night owl.
[02:31:11.584 --> 02:31:13.525]  Every night owl should have this product.
[02:31:14.025 --> 02:31:17.466]  I will buy this product as soon as possible again.
[02:31:17.706 --> 02:31:18.367]  And I should add,
[02:31:19.167 --> 02:31:20.308]  That's a great name for this product.
[02:31:20.568 --> 02:31:22.389]  Not just for the winter, but for night owls as well.
[02:31:22.409 --> 02:31:24.130]  In fact, it should probably be called Night Owl.
[02:31:24.470 --> 02:31:25.791]  Night Owl's Winter Sun.
[02:31:25.871 --> 02:31:27.472]  Or, Night Owls Get Sun in the Winter.
[02:31:27.512 --> 02:31:28.072]  Okay, I'm going to stop.
[02:31:28.312 --> 02:31:29.073]  I said I'd shut up!
[02:31:29.933 --> 02:31:30.754]  But back to the script.
[02:31:31.114 --> 02:31:32.995]  Liquid Sunshine is what they call it.
[02:31:33.015 --> 02:31:33.755]  I love that name too.
[02:31:34.196 --> 02:31:36.217]  I will be using this product for two years now.
[02:31:36.517 --> 02:31:40.719]  It's wonderful out in the Pacific Northwest to get this Liquid Sunshine.
[02:31:40.759 --> 02:31:43.321]  Patrick, thank you for the support and for the review.
[02:31:43.381 --> 02:31:44.821]  You make it literally possible.
[02:31:45.882 --> 02:31:50.665]  Continuing with Silver Bullet, the highest quality, 30 parts per million colloidal silver out there.
[02:31:51.205 --> 02:31:54.047]  Dale, should be called Magic Bullet.
[02:31:54.327 --> 02:31:57.869]  Oh my gosh, the listeners are so much smarter than me and I'm not being patronizing.
[02:31:58.389 --> 02:32:00.390]  I've been, that's what a Silver Bullet's supposed to be.
[02:32:01.611 --> 02:32:04.093]  I've been using Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver for years now.
[02:32:04.453 --> 02:32:06.555]  This was the first product I purchased from Inforestore.
[02:32:06.895 --> 02:32:12.759]  Whenever I feel the first hazes of cold or sore throat coming on, a dose of Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has always ended it before it starts.
[02:32:13.179 --> 02:32:18.923]  I've been giving it away for family and Christmas and birthdays since 2015, and it's worked for everyone.
[02:32:19.403 --> 02:32:25.807]  It has become an expected gift for our family, and that's why we get you the best products, because we want to repeat customers.
[02:32:26.048 --> 02:32:26.868]  It's all a win-win.
[02:32:27.028 --> 02:32:27.929]  That's an awesome review.
[02:32:27.989 --> 02:32:31.251]  Thank you, Dale, for your support and for what you've done for your family as well.
[02:32:31.271 --> 02:32:33.232]  Well, we've only got 20 seconds left, folks.
[02:32:33.292 --> 02:32:36.252]  I can't get to all the other Silver Bullet reviews, the Caveman reviews.
[02:32:36.292 --> 02:32:37.473]  They're all five-star.
[02:32:37.713 --> 02:32:43.074]  They talk about the meal replacement, how great it is, how it blows them away post-workout, pre-workout.
[02:32:43.715 --> 02:32:46.996]  Taste, you know, okay, they say, but it's the results that really matter.
[02:32:47.296 --> 02:32:49.076]  Best post-workout ever is what Andrew says.
[02:32:49.396 --> 02:32:52.897]  Find it all, folks, at InfoWarsTore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:32:52.937 --> 02:32:58.059]  You can't lose because you're funding the second American Revolution, and I salute you all!
[02:33:05.518 --> 02:33:08.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:18.569 --> 02:33:19.409]  The threat is real.
[02:33:19.910 --> 02:33:25.955]  It's the globalist engineering, anti-Christian, anti-Western operations to bring in the technocracy.
[02:33:32.440 --> 02:33:34.261]  Tomorrow, it kicks off at 8 a.m.
[02:33:36.154 --> 02:33:36.514]  8 a.m.
[02:33:36.554 --> 02:33:37.075]  Central.
[02:33:38.716 --> 02:33:39.176]  ATX time.
[02:33:40.357 --> 02:33:42.518]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:42.999 --> 02:33:48.202]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:33:48.622 --> 02:33:53.966]  Live 34-hour coverage of the one-year anniversary of American rebirth and renaissance.
[02:33:57.145 --> 02:34:06.067]  We're going to be showing the clips of the night we won, what happened, what Trump's delivered on, what we haven't delivered on, how the globalists are striking back, the total war.
[02:34:07.526 --> 02:34:09.548]  All the latest news and information 8 a.m.
[02:34:09.568 --> 02:34:13.411]  tomorrow, right through the evening, right through to the next day at 6 p.m.
[02:34:13.711 --> 02:34:16.153]  when the War Room with Owen Schroer and Roger Stone ends.
[02:34:16.814 --> 02:34:27.763]  This is an exercise in InfoWAR, spreading the articles, spreading the videos, spreading the live links that'll be at InfoWars.com forward slash show tomorrow and in a big page we're gonna have on the front page.
[02:34:29.073 --> 02:34:51.281]  To go out and trigger the authoritarian bullies, to let them know we're not going to give in, we're not going to give up, we're winning, we're going to exercise our free speech, we're going to bring jobs back to America, we're going to promote the family, we're going to promote religious freedom, we're going to promote Christianity, we're going to promote pro-life ideas and valuing human life, we're going to expose the globalists, we're going to do it, and we're going to keep doing it.
[02:34:52.113 --> 02:34:53.694]  I'm going to go right back to your phone calls right now.
[02:34:53.734 --> 02:35:00.159]  In the next segment, there's a new vicious Netflix program meant to kick off civil war right on time, we're going to tell you about.
[02:35:00.619 --> 02:35:05.682]  And a very powerful speech that triggers a globalist in Congress.
[02:35:05.743 --> 02:35:09.005]  Congresswoman flips out on a pro-life activist after she schools him on abortion.
[02:35:09.365 --> 02:35:11.066]  That's coming up as well.
[02:35:11.907 --> 02:35:13.768]  But first, let's go back to the calls.
[02:35:14.289 --> 02:35:18.231]  Let's talk to Mark in Florida, then we'll go to Zach, Anthony, and others.
[02:35:18.311 --> 02:35:18.972]  Mark, welcome.
[02:35:20.540 --> 02:35:21.241]  Hello, Alex.
[02:35:21.341 --> 02:35:22.922]  Yes, I'm in Oregon today.
[02:35:22.942 --> 02:35:27.265]  I'm not in Florida today, but it's great to speak with you, Alex.
[02:35:27.325 --> 02:35:33.030]  By the way, if you could possibly get, like, tomorrow's broadcast would be a big example.
[02:35:34.311 --> 02:35:42.157]  Make that accessible to people who only have the option to listen to you on the telephone, on the listen line.
[02:35:42.657 --> 02:35:44.539]  We miss everything, basically.
[02:35:44.579 --> 02:35:46.841]  We only get your show, which is a whole lot.
[02:35:47.101 --> 02:35:48.262]  It's everything in itself.
[02:35:48.962 --> 02:35:54.605]  But it'd be wonderful to hear the new programs and everything that comes over the internet as such.
[02:35:54.745 --> 02:35:55.685]  I'd sure appreciate it.
[02:35:55.805 --> 02:35:57.246]  We're working hard on the infrastructure.
[02:35:57.266 --> 02:36:00.667]  I've got a team of about 40 people here right now building the new studio.
[02:36:00.707 --> 02:36:05.990]  We're expending all of our fuel to try to expand the operation, so absolutely.
[02:36:06.690 --> 02:36:12.178]  If volunteers want to pick up our streams and do free telephone services for people, we'll plug it and put it out.
[02:36:12.518 --> 02:36:13.480]  Right now we're maxed out.
[02:36:13.500 --> 02:36:19.168]  We need the audience to build the infrastructure or to put us on local stations in their area and then spread the word.
[02:36:20.245 --> 02:36:25.510]  I faithfully spend quite a bit of money on your products because... I understand, sir.
[02:36:25.810 --> 02:36:29.413]  I'm just telling you, we are just maxed out.
[02:36:29.453 --> 02:36:30.574]  There's new equipment everywhere.
[02:36:30.595 --> 02:36:31.615]  We're trying to hire people.
[02:36:32.256 --> 02:36:33.697]  We're trying to deal with personnel issues.
[02:36:33.717 --> 02:36:35.999]  I'm just telling you, we are maxed out here.
[02:36:36.260 --> 02:36:38.582]  Like, our guns are melting hot in the Info War.
[02:36:38.762 --> 02:36:40.023]  We're trying to put new barrels on.
[02:36:40.083 --> 02:36:41.865]  I mean, it's smoking around here.
[02:36:43.231 --> 02:36:47.874]  I can tell just by listening to you, Alex, every day since right after 9-11.
[02:36:47.914 --> 02:36:49.335]  You know, I've followed you closely.
[02:36:49.355 --> 02:36:49.656]  I know, brother.
[02:36:49.676 --> 02:36:50.596]  You've been calling for years.
[02:36:50.956 --> 02:36:52.037]  So what's on your mind, my friend?
[02:36:52.057 --> 02:36:54.659]  I was going to say you're a human dynamo.
[02:36:54.759 --> 02:36:55.360]  No, no, no.
[02:36:55.780 --> 02:36:56.300]  Wish I was.
[02:36:56.380 --> 02:37:10.250]  Alex, it's quite clear by the laws of this country and even by statements on the other side, such as Dianne Feinstein made recently that Antifa, whatever, how you pronounce it,
[02:37:11.371 --> 02:37:13.672]  ...is a terrorist organization.
[02:37:14.552 --> 02:37:18.273]  They need to be gathered up just as Donald Trump has gathered up the pedophiles.
[02:37:19.314 --> 02:37:25.355]  And if we don't, they're just going to keep on growing because it's not the only... they have many sister organizations, I understand.
[02:37:25.375 --> 02:37:29.217]  Well, they're being listed as terrorists more and more, and by the state of New Jersey and other folks.
[02:37:29.797 --> 02:37:31.037]  But you're absolutely right.
[02:37:31.117 --> 02:37:32.117]  And here's the bad news.
[02:37:32.478 --> 02:37:34.058]  They know how to pull false flags now.
[02:37:34.118 --> 02:37:35.058]  They want our guns.
[02:37:35.358 --> 02:37:36.039]  They're communists.
[02:37:36.059 --> 02:37:37.199]  They're always going to have weapons.
[02:37:37.499 --> 02:37:38.639]  They want a violent revolution.
[02:37:38.679 --> 02:37:40.080]  They want to get our guns.
[02:37:40.760 --> 02:37:42.221]  So they can finally take over.
[02:37:42.702 --> 02:37:44.603]  And here it is, a USC shooting.
[02:37:44.643 --> 02:37:45.524]  This is breaking now.
[02:37:45.544 --> 02:37:49.947]  The gunman opens fire on the University of South Carolina, injuring at least one.
[02:37:49.987 --> 02:37:51.928]  We hope that nobody's been killed.
[02:37:52.369 --> 02:37:57.693]  There is said to be an active shooter situation, University of South Carolina, with one person to believe have been shot.
[02:37:58.587 --> 02:38:03.573]  University of South Carolina Upstate in Spartanburg issued a Twitter alert warning.
[02:38:03.613 --> 02:38:06.076]  Shots fired with four buildings on campus placing a lockdown.
[02:38:06.416 --> 02:38:09.860]  That lockdown was later lifted so it might have been a backfire or one person shot.
[02:38:10.280 --> 02:38:11.141]  No arrests have been reported.
[02:38:11.181 --> 02:38:11.542]  We'll see.
[02:38:11.622 --> 02:38:12.583]  I hope it's not real.
[02:38:13.244 --> 02:38:13.984]  Mark, anything else?
[02:38:14.884 --> 02:38:28.309]  Yes, the military and the intelligence community, white hats in this country, have the full capability at Donald Trump's behest of actually beginning the gathering and we already have the camps built and they can be put right into the camps.
[02:38:28.329 --> 02:38:35.392]  There's an example that needs to be made of they're just going to keep on growing and we're going to get to a flare point
[02:38:35.972 --> 02:38:39.473]  Sure, sure.
[02:38:39.613 --> 02:38:52.736]  I don't want to become what we're fighting, but the groups calling for violent overthrow, calling for killing people, they should be arrested and tried by juries of their peers, and people should be pulling their money out of the globalist institutions.
[02:38:53.216 --> 02:38:58.957]  They should be getting really aggressive, but they have built FEMA camps, they have built emergency centers for conservatives, libertarians.
[02:38:59.737 --> 02:39:09.467]  Uh, if a civil war does break out and things get rough, I mean, we'll probably have to use them, but it's not going to be secret, and we're going to have lawyers, and these people are going to end up, uh, you know, getting their trials.
[02:39:09.567 --> 02:39:14.331]  But we may have to set up emergency centers if they start up, because they're trying to get the average leftist to go out and start killing.
[02:39:14.692 --> 02:39:16.433]  And if they all just start killing en masse,
[02:39:17.492 --> 02:39:23.198]  We will have to round them up, because they are planning a helter-skelter violent leftist spasm.
[02:39:24.139 --> 02:39:25.601]  And we just can't sit here and take it.
[02:39:26.201 --> 02:39:36.993]  I mean, they're a bunch of weird wimps, I appreciate your call, who never had a coming of age, never grew up as men, now they're 30, 40 years old, and they want to have a coming of age, killing Christians and conservatives.
[02:39:37.834 --> 02:39:39.675]  And they're all a bunch of devil-worshiping pedophiles.
[02:39:40.658 --> 02:39:49.873]  They're devil-worshipping pedophiles and it turns out this lunatic in Texas was a homicidal maniac who was a pedophile and was thrown in a mental institution because he tried to kill his chain of command.
[02:39:50.173 --> 02:39:54.240]  I guess they were too scared of him so they just let him out of the military and didn't even transfer the paperwork.
[02:39:55.427 --> 02:39:57.648]  So, you know, this guy's a homicidal maniac.
[02:39:57.688 --> 02:40:04.290]  He should have been locked up for 10 years and, you know, if somebody's so dangerous, too, you can't ever release them again, give them a lobotomy.
[02:40:05.130 --> 02:40:10.311]  Not for lobotomies against, you know, people that aren't violent, but you're a homicidal maniac who wants to kill everybody.
[02:40:10.331 --> 02:40:11.672]  Well, we'll just cut your brain out.
[02:40:11.752 --> 02:40:12.372]  How's that sound?
[02:40:13.772 --> 02:40:15.193]  Zach in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:40:15.233 --> 02:40:15.573]  Go ahead.
[02:40:17.512 --> 02:40:28.075]  Yes Alex, it's great to be back on, and I just have to really update some key information and connect some thoughts regarding... Yeah, because you were gonna come on as a guest, but then you got in some trouble.
[02:40:29.295 --> 02:40:29.455]  Yeah.
[02:40:29.475 --> 02:40:31.675]  And I didn't even notice that was the regular Zach from Florida.
[02:40:31.695 --> 02:40:34.636]  I'm sorry I made you hold an hour, but I'm just all over the map today.
[02:40:36.396 --> 02:40:42.618]  Because you talked about the Saudi Arabia shake-up that was about to happen, how they were involved with the Vegas attack.
[02:40:42.638 --> 02:40:46.859]  Just to recap for folks, you've been a great source of info, so go ahead.
[02:40:47.867 --> 02:40:52.568]  Yeah, and I got back in Puerto Rico, just haven't heard anything back, but I'm sure you guys are busy there building your operation.
[02:40:53.789 --> 02:40:56.569]  So, let's get into this Saudi Arabia thing, which is very important.
[02:40:56.909 --> 02:41:04.692]  The shakeup that comes right after the Vegas intel that dropped, which is important, and this is deep and this is major, so let's get right into it.
[02:41:04.712 --> 02:41:07.512]  Yemen, this is the next play.
[02:41:08.132 --> 02:41:08.873]  It's going to be Yemen.
[02:41:08.913 --> 02:41:14.974]  What we have in February is, you know, people have such a short memory, but I've compiled the timeline here so I don't miss this stuff.
[02:41:15.374 --> 02:41:17.195]  In February, we have to remember the Navy SEAL
[02:41:17.635 --> 02:41:17.916]  We're good.
[02:41:33.605 --> 02:41:38.227]  And, you know, saying that this raid in Yemen was not appropriate.
[02:41:38.327 --> 02:41:39.227]  He doesn't know what he's doing.
[02:41:39.267 --> 02:41:39.988]  He's out of control.
[02:41:40.268 --> 02:41:41.228]  And why do you think that was?
[02:41:41.628 --> 02:41:45.370]  The information that was gathered in Yemen uncovered them all physically.
[02:41:45.790 --> 02:41:47.370]  They physically gathered that intel.
[02:41:47.630 --> 02:41:51.152]  Sure, that was who was controlling the ISIS Al Qaeda operatives out of Saudi Arabia.
[02:41:52.521 --> 02:42:03.265]  And it's no coincidence that a few months after that, you have John McCain miraculously having a brain cancer surgery out of nowhere because make no mistake, he will be questioned in the future.
[02:42:03.305 --> 02:42:10.428]  They're going through some other motions right now, but it is very convenient when it's going to come to him being questioned and his lack of memory therefore.
[02:42:10.868 --> 02:42:13.270]  Sure, because he went and funded the radical jihadis himself.
[02:42:13.310 --> 02:42:14.591]  He quarterbacked the whole deal.
[02:42:14.951 --> 02:42:16.793]  He's been up to it, you know, in his eyeballs.
[02:42:17.614 --> 02:42:19.836]  And now, you're right, they go get the intel out of Yemen.
[02:42:19.876 --> 02:42:21.237]  Now this is happening in Saudi Arabia.
[02:42:21.517 --> 02:42:24.440]  They're rolling up the whole globalist network with the Bushes, you name it.
[02:42:25.601 --> 02:42:24.440]  100%.
[02:42:25.621 --> 02:42:28.063]  And the caller you had earlier was exhausted.
[02:42:28.103 --> 02:42:29.444]  His name was Tom, saying that
[02:42:30.297 --> 02:42:31.939]  Uh, North Korea is not a big issue.
[02:42:31.959 --> 02:42:33.200]  North Korea is a big issue.
[02:42:33.220 --> 02:42:35.802]  When it comes back... I tell you what, come back in the next segment, Zach.
[02:42:35.822 --> 02:42:37.363]  And next time Zach calls in, let me know.
[02:42:37.403 --> 02:42:38.004]  It's not your fault.
[02:42:38.084 --> 02:42:39.185]  I could have seen his name.
[02:42:39.245 --> 02:42:42.808]  I just don't really... I just go to the next caller in order and then look at the next name later.
[02:42:42.828 --> 02:42:44.369]  I don't really screen the calls.
[02:42:44.389 --> 02:42:45.590]  I just kind of go to whoever.
[02:42:46.371 --> 02:42:50.936]  But Zach's been a great source of info, so we're going to get Zach on tomorrow if he can do it.
[02:42:50.976 --> 02:42:53.139]  I'm going to talk to Zach during the break.
[02:42:53.519 --> 02:42:56.563]  So guys, ask him when he wants to come on at any of those times tomorrow.
[02:42:57.004 --> 02:42:58.505]  Zach's going to come on and talk all about this.
[02:42:58.545 --> 02:42:59.707]  What a great source of info.
[02:42:59.967 --> 02:43:00.588]  We'll be right back.
[02:43:04.013 --> 02:43:13.836]  Before we even had civilization 6,000 years ago, humans communicated through the clothing that they wore, the society they were part of, what class they were from.
[02:43:14.676 --> 02:43:24.038]  And today we see the leftists, the globalists, controlling fashion, controlling culture through Hollywood and through their media systems.
[02:43:24.438 --> 02:43:27.339]  But more and more there is a rebellion against that system.
[02:43:27.919 --> 02:43:37.625]  Clothing is a statement, and it's essential to make that statement by wearing your colors loud and proud, just like I do when I'm out on the streets of America.
[02:43:38.085 --> 02:43:43.268]  So right now, folks, we're gonna debut some new shirts and also some of the classics from the InfoWars store.
[02:43:44.348 --> 02:43:46.070]  This is one of our newest shirts.
[02:43:46.130 --> 02:43:47.070]  It's a limited edition.
[02:43:47.631 --> 02:43:49.632]  I'm calling it InfoWars In Your Face.
[02:43:49.872 --> 02:43:56.597]  It's a navy blue shirt, really high quality, feels great, fits great, with a big red InfoWars.com right in the center.
[02:43:56.917 --> 02:44:01.120]  On the shoulder, InfoWars.com and an American flag on a blue background.
[02:44:01.361 --> 02:44:02.862]  And remember, WikiLeaks shows
[02:44:03.582 --> 02:44:08.925]  That organizations like CNN are owned by foreign multinational corporations, hell-bent on enslaving this country.
[02:44:09.226 --> 02:44:18.051]  So when you expose them as fake news, you're doing your patriotic duty, and you're exercising your First Amendment in defiance of their bullying, garbage, and tyranny.
[02:44:18.451 --> 02:44:22.614]  And on the back, InfoWars.com is the standard of real news.
[02:44:23.114 --> 02:44:24.215]  And of course, this classic?
[02:44:24.915 --> 02:44:25.496]  Says it all.
[02:44:25.616 --> 02:44:26.497]  Need I say more?
[02:44:26.997 --> 02:44:28.599]  You want to have a political message out there?
[02:44:28.639 --> 02:44:34.424]  You want to state the facts of Americana and stand against the horrors we've seen in Russia, China, North Korea, Venezuela?
[02:44:34.745 --> 02:44:37.808]  Then this is the shirt for you at infowarestore.com.
[02:44:38.268 --> 02:44:43.853]  Now, if you want to be a little bit more low-key, this is a brand new shirt, hot off the press, the same great fabric.
[02:44:44.574 --> 02:44:46.897]  That's Info Wars with an American flag.
[02:44:47.238 --> 02:44:55.628]  This is more stealth if you just want to basically reach out to other fellow travelers that are awake to the worldwide revolution against the globalists.
[02:44:55.889 --> 02:44:59.473]  And this shirt, The Spirit of 1776, is a great addition to do just that.
[02:45:00.274 --> 02:45:09.745]  At InfoWarsStore.com, we've got more than 15 versions of different Molon Labe, or Come and Take It, in good old-fashioned English, t-shirts.
[02:45:09.905 --> 02:45:12.388]  And right here on the back, the good old Don't Tread on Me.
[02:45:12.768 --> 02:45:13.850]  InfoWars.com.
[02:45:13.890 --> 02:45:14.390]  Spread the word.
[02:45:15.111 --> 02:45:16.232]  I designed this baby.
[02:45:16.312 --> 02:45:18.734]  It's an AK-47 saying, come and take it.
[02:45:19.115 --> 02:45:23.359]  And then, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[02:45:23.759 --> 02:45:27.583]  The Second Amendment is the type that fills up the image of the firearm.
[02:45:28.023 --> 02:45:30.705]  This shirt is the second oldest shirt in our arsenal.
[02:45:30.725 --> 02:45:32.127]  It's been around about 19 years.
[02:45:32.747 --> 02:45:36.351]  It's the classic InfoWars tyranny response team shirt.
[02:45:36.631 --> 02:45:39.774]  And of course we've seen the NFL taking a knee.
[02:45:40.635 --> 02:45:44.218]  Uh, during the national anthem to basically piss on the American flag.
[02:45:44.939 --> 02:45:45.820]  That's disrespectful.
[02:45:45.860 --> 02:45:49.864]  But when you fly the American flag upside down and explain under U.S.
[02:45:49.944 --> 02:45:57.412]  code that the country is under crisis, it's a symbol of respect for the nation and the flag to point out the country is in crisis.
[02:45:57.792 --> 02:45:59.234]  Our republic is in distress.
[02:45:59.714 --> 02:46:00.175]  Ask me why.
[02:46:00.835 --> 02:46:02.758]  This baby is a classic year-round.
[02:46:02.918 --> 02:46:08.444]  Good old camouflage with the Day-Glo orange hunting, don't tread on me, Info Wars.
[02:46:08.905 --> 02:46:10.386]  Oh, and this is my birthday suit.
[02:46:10.447 --> 02:46:13.450]  Mama gave me this one, so I guess I better go out and put another shirt on.
[02:46:13.891 --> 02:46:16.033]  I call this the Patriot Rock and Roll shirt.
[02:46:16.674 --> 02:46:18.916]  I think the image tells you what it's all about.
[02:46:19.597 --> 02:46:20.378]  It's all about freedom.
[02:46:20.418 --> 02:46:21.779]  It's all about rugged individualism.
[02:46:22.300 --> 02:46:23.200]  Resist Tyranny.
[02:46:23.861 --> 02:46:24.842]  Made in America.
[02:46:24.862 --> 02:46:24.842]  1776.
[02:46:25.482 --> 02:46:28.565]  And I've been showing you the fronts of these great shirts.
[02:46:28.785 --> 02:46:29.766]  The backs are really cool.
[02:46:30.106 --> 02:46:30.767]  Look at that back.
[02:46:30.847 --> 02:46:31.748]  That is pure Americana.
[02:46:32.972 --> 02:46:38.113]  And I almost forgot, we've got dozens and dozens of great limited edition ball caps available.
[02:46:38.233 --> 02:46:38.914]  The Dayglo.
[02:46:39.434 --> 02:46:43.515]  Perfect when you're out jogging or out walking the dog, down the road.
[02:46:43.675 --> 02:46:45.315]  This is my favorite ball cap.
[02:46:45.676 --> 02:46:46.996]  Over 20 ball caps we've put out.
[02:46:47.016 --> 02:46:48.276]  It's got the nice patch.
[02:46:48.616 --> 02:46:49.657]  Infowars.com.
[02:46:49.897 --> 02:46:50.777]  The Don't Tread On Me.
[02:46:51.037 --> 02:46:54.478]  This, my friends, is the ball cap that I wear when I'm out and about in town.
[02:46:54.878 --> 02:46:56.458]  The crew absolutely loves it as well.
[02:46:56.719 --> 02:47:01.500]  Thank you all for your support and check out the amazing Liberty Apparel at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:47:05.895 --> 02:47:08.551]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:31.283 --> 02:47:32.425]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:47:32.465 --> 02:47:45.141]  We kick off a 34-hour broadcast celebrating the one-year anniversary of the historic victory that is now leading the way for other nations to pull out of unelected authoritarian communist and socialist globalism.
[02:47:46.792 --> 02:47:56.354]  Now, he's been calling a couple years, but he's been calling almost every week the last six months or so, and Zach just has great sources.
[02:47:56.414 --> 02:48:01.295]  I don't know his whole background there from former Special Forces Command in Florida.
[02:48:01.315 --> 02:48:04.136]  I think that's where he mentioned some of his info was from before.
[02:48:04.596 --> 02:48:12.898]  I just know from all my big sources, and I got a lot of sources right up to the President, I'll just leave it at that, who we still occasionally get info directly from.
[02:48:12.918 --> 02:48:13.958]  I mean, that's not a secret.
[02:48:16.004 --> 02:48:18.851]  In fact, General Kelly's blockade of info is suddenly lifted.
[02:48:19.312 --> 02:48:19.933]  It's crazy.
[02:48:20.534 --> 02:48:23.381]  He's gotten on board it now, is the information we've gotten.
[02:48:26.209 --> 02:48:31.893]  He was going to join us last week for an hour, and then I guess he got called in and got in some trouble, even though he's never given us anything classified.
[02:48:32.133 --> 02:48:42.441]  He just pointed out what's happening, and he said last week, big shake-up in Saudi Arabia, criminal networks there working with ISIS and Al-Qaeda, connected in to what happened in Vegas.
[02:48:43.101 --> 02:48:50.787]  And I was given that information from sources in Vegas, but also in the federal government, but they said, please don't talk about that yet.
[02:48:52.588 --> 02:48:54.410]  But then he called in and talked about it.
[02:48:54.430 --> 02:48:55.611]  So he's got some sources.
[02:48:55.631 --> 02:48:57.233]  I don't know what he wants to say about himself.
[02:48:57.253 --> 02:48:58.715]  He said, join us by Skype tomorrow.
[02:48:59.055 --> 02:49:00.317]  I sure hope it ends up happening.
[02:49:00.337 --> 02:49:09.847]  But just recap Vegas, what you predicted last week, the civil war inside, Wahhabist Islam, and what the next big shoot-a-drop is.
[02:49:09.907 --> 02:49:11.790]  I mean, they're killing a bunch of these princes.
[02:49:12.450 --> 02:49:13.611]  There's a civil war over there.
[02:49:13.651 --> 02:49:15.053]  They're blowing up their helicopters.
[02:49:15.753 --> 02:49:19.176]  And we knew this tied back to trying to find out who's actually behind ISIS.
[02:49:19.556 --> 02:49:25.001]  We now know it's the Clintons, it's Obama, it's Hillary, it's the Arab Spring, it's the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:49:25.342 --> 02:49:31.387]  And now this is the proof from Yemen in that raid that got the globalists so upset when it happened.
[02:49:31.427 --> 02:49:32.288]  So walk us through it.
[02:49:33.486 --> 02:49:38.628]  Okay, so we have the call on October 31st, me and yourself, and they're talking about the Saudi connections in Vegas.
[02:49:39.148 --> 02:49:48.452]  Obviously, during that weekend, you have the incredible shakeup in Saudi Arabia, and it's not coincidental, because that was pretty important stuff, and that's the kind of stuff you don't bring up.
[02:49:48.532 --> 02:50:01.097]  But, because here's the thing with those PMCs, when you have this prince who was arrested, he's at the big center of this, because Prince Al-Waleed, the billionaire who was... He's the one always running down Trump, quarterbacking a bunch of the leftist stuff here.
[02:50:02.011 --> 02:50:05.933]  He's publicly funded several PNCs, and this is what they do with the private military companies.
[02:50:06.453 --> 02:50:11.155]  They run as a certain name in a certain organization, then like Blackwater and some of the other ones, they continue to change names.
[02:50:11.195 --> 02:50:15.256]  And they've been ballsy enough to be in big firefights in Saudi Arabia the last four days.
[02:50:15.756 --> 02:50:17.597]  That's not really in our news, but some of it's leaked.
[02:50:17.637 --> 02:50:19.458]  I mean, there's actual civil war going on.
[02:50:20.182 --> 02:50:44.728]  So this happens, we link the information on the 31st, and obviously we see what happens there on the weekend leading into the new week, so this happens, but what we have to realize is, and this is the prediction, and this is the next big news which will occur this week, unless we kind of stop it here, there's going to be attacks by what will be described as Yemeni nationals in the United States, make no mistake, but these are
[02:50:45.408 --> 02:50:47.029]  And I'm just going to go ahead and put the agency out here.
[02:50:47.049 --> 02:50:47.969]  These are CIA operatives.
[02:50:47.989 --> 02:50:54.753]  These are CIA proxies who are rogue at this point because their entire infrastructure has been dissolved by the Trump administration.
[02:50:54.993 --> 02:50:55.273]  Okay?
[02:50:55.513 --> 02:51:03.517]  When you launch an ICBM from Yemen, there is absolutely not a reality in the world where they have the capability of doing that.
[02:51:03.857 --> 02:51:04.137]  Okay?
[02:51:04.477 --> 02:51:08.179]  So for this thing firing into Riyadh, being shut down, they are incredibly desperate.
[02:51:08.619 --> 02:51:09.780]  And I'm just going to say it right now.
[02:51:09.860 --> 02:51:13.842]  During this week, there is an attempt by Yemeni nationals in the United States to pull off a false flag.
[02:51:14.611 --> 02:51:24.662]  So just as you said weeks before this came out, they pushed their bluff with Trump of a destabilization campaign and he just basically called their bluff and rolled them up.
[02:51:35.720 --> 02:51:38.401]  You have, and John McCain is just so done.
[02:51:38.781 --> 02:51:40.442]  John McCain plays a big part in this, okay?
[02:51:40.682 --> 02:51:41.662]  He plays a major part in this.
[02:51:41.702 --> 02:51:52.767]  He's timestamped on February 2nd, making his comments about the Navy SEALs, you know, making the raid in Yemen, and how disappointed he was by the... Well, he's photographed with the leaders of ISIS before they created the group.
[02:51:52.807 --> 02:51:54.227]  I mean, he's red-handed.
[02:51:54.988 --> 02:51:57.889]  ...who are in Yemen as we speak and are freaking out because
[02:52:00.023 --> 02:52:01.684]  The spout of money has dried up.
[02:52:01.984 --> 02:52:04.425]  They got Al-Waleed in Riyadh right now.
[02:52:19.072 --> 02:52:20.293]  pragmatic politics.
[02:52:20.333 --> 02:52:21.473]  He's told the King this.
[02:52:21.933 --> 02:52:25.715]  The King, once he was shown the evidence of the data files, got on board.
[02:52:25.915 --> 02:52:32.118]  Now they're getting in line and Iran better get in line because this is all unfolding.
[02:52:32.138 --> 02:52:32.678]  But you're right.
[02:52:32.958 --> 02:52:41.102]  They've got stay-behind terror networks in the deep state that's refused to go and is going to now launch attacks and try to blame the Second Amendment.
[02:52:41.362 --> 02:52:42.883]  You can just see it unfolding.
[02:52:42.903 --> 02:52:43.463]  So continue.
[02:52:44.295 --> 02:52:48.677]  So basically, you know, the color of some individuals are expecting there will be a war with Iran.
[02:52:48.817 --> 02:52:52.258]  No, this is the war with Iran.
[02:52:52.399 --> 02:52:55.620]  There is no kinetic war with Iran without their deep state backing.
[02:52:55.940 --> 02:52:58.341]  And that is gone, thanks to Donald Trump.
[02:52:58.861 --> 02:53:05.164]  He has shifted his real military focus, I guess you could call it, into the South Pacific.
[02:53:05.704 --> 02:53:13.708]  In Korea, as we talked about, me and yourself, six months ago, bringing up strategic patience in Trump's speech in Korea, where he takes his business code off.
[02:53:14.449 --> 02:53:19.472]  And puts on the bomber jacket, is the most symbolic thing I've ever been to read, specifically from a sheet of paper.
[02:53:19.492 --> 02:53:20.693]  He's a great speaker and order.
[02:53:21.333 --> 02:53:29.497]  But he speaks and specifically mentions the term strategic patience, which has not been uttered diplomatically, like he has said in the last 25 years.
[02:53:29.758 --> 02:53:30.638]  And that's for good reason.
[02:53:31.098 --> 02:53:35.121]  Because these are these are deep state intelligence back proxies.
[02:53:35.261 --> 02:53:36.761]  There is no kinetic war with Iran.
[02:53:36.801 --> 02:53:37.562]  We're in it right now.
[02:53:38.092 --> 02:53:42.214]  We've leaked them, we've double-crossed them, Trump is playing, I don't even know what you'd call it, 5G chess.
[02:53:42.534 --> 02:53:47.676]  He's so far ahead, it's so brilliant, and this line that he's an idiot, they are highly mistaken.
[02:53:47.696 --> 02:53:48.796]  Well, I know what Trump did.
[02:53:48.856 --> 02:53:56.240]  He went, the day after he got elected, once he was sworn in, he went to the CIA, he gave them all big plaques, American flag plaques on wood.
[02:53:56.540 --> 02:54:01.722]  I'm only saying that people know that I actually talked to folks at Robert C. in on the meeting, and it wasn't a classified meeting.
[02:54:02.703 --> 02:54:08.010]  And the point is, but it never leaked, and he said, whoever's for America and wants to be straight shooters, I'm going to back you 100%.
[02:54:08.490 --> 02:54:10.253]  Whoever isn't, get ready, I'm coming after you.
[02:54:11.214 --> 02:54:14.158]  And he said, we're not playing games and double-crossing people anymore.
[02:54:14.578 --> 02:54:18.623]  He said, this whole global system of double-crossing and funding terror is over.
[02:54:19.244 --> 02:54:30.574]  Then he got with the people that understood the full operation and green-lighted them rolling up these networks of the Muslim Brotherhood that we know has been funded by multi-actors in the Middle East, not just Iran.
[02:54:30.934 --> 02:54:34.577]  And so what we're seeing is a major stabilization operation by the President.
[02:54:34.597 --> 02:54:38.120]  But I agree with you, they're going to try to launch some attacks.
[02:54:38.180 --> 02:54:39.461]  But what did they think?
[02:54:40.322 --> 02:54:45.126]  Was going to happen when they pulled off the Vegas operation.
[02:54:45.586 --> 02:54:51.791]  I mean, did they think Trump was just going to crap his pants and say, okay, we'll, we'll, you know, please don't stage a bunch of terror attacks.
[02:54:52.231 --> 02:54:53.292]  You know, I'll back off now.
[02:54:55.239 --> 02:54:56.960]  I don't know what they really put Trump in.
[02:54:56.980 --> 02:55:05.566]  I don't think people have underestimated him, obviously, but that was symbolic and that was blackmailing to other people within the actual infrastructure of our government.
[02:55:06.967 --> 02:55:20.075]  There are certain words, few words, and certain signifiers within an attack, even within the attack in Texas, which you can get into, that are essentially symbols to people within the infrastructure, essentially a hand being played in a game of poker.
[02:55:20.956 --> 02:55:23.399]  And they're also having the drills right now of the U.S.
[02:55:23.439 --> 02:55:30.106]  power being knocked out, which is really the cover, and the enemy knows this, to put teams in place guarding strategic power stations.
[02:55:30.407 --> 02:55:37.175]  This country's on a full war footing right now with the globalists and their Islamic proxy armies, but we know they've also got other proxy groups.
[02:55:37.535 --> 02:55:39.538]  Any information on who else we should be watching out for?
[02:55:40.407 --> 02:55:41.868]  Well, I'm going to tell you right now, there's no difference.
[02:55:41.888 --> 02:55:44.110]  Antifa is the creation of the Deep State.
[02:55:44.450 --> 02:55:51.975]  If you would look into the creation and the actual, you know, standing up of what we call Al-Qaeda or today ISIS, there's no difference in Antifa.
[02:55:51.995 --> 02:56:01.022]  So you have at the helm, at the actual helm, the funding helm of these groups, you have Deep State individuals who are carrying this out.
[02:56:01.362 --> 02:56:05.125]  And I'm just going to tell you right now, this Texas shooting, I'm not going to speculate too much.
[02:56:08.073 --> 02:56:08.834]  I shouldn't get into that.
[02:56:08.934 --> 02:56:09.994]  Actually, let me just stop right there.
[02:56:10.014 --> 02:56:16.297]  But you're going to see more attacks like the Texas shooting that may be double barbed.
[02:56:16.497 --> 02:56:23.520]  And what double barbed means is they have a specific point and they have specific blackmail characteristics of people within the government.
[02:56:23.720 --> 02:56:28.923]  But they also, the double barb, the second barb of it is to carry out political agendas like gun control.
[02:56:29.603 --> 02:56:31.163]  Sure, and it shows their sick mind.
[02:56:31.224 --> 02:56:36.306]  They think they attack a country music deal, they attack a church, they attack Texas, just like Hitler bombed London.
[02:56:37.006 --> 02:56:39.229]  That only made the Brits get behind the war.
[02:56:39.369 --> 02:56:44.075]  I don't know why they think all this intimidation is going to make us give our guns up or make us bow.
[02:56:44.115 --> 02:56:44.996]  They're really stupid.
[02:56:46.016 --> 02:56:53.022]  This week you will see an attempt, and hopefully it's foiled, I hope, but they're brazen and they've obviously been doing things.
[02:56:53.042 --> 02:57:01.088]  There will be an attempted attack on the United States of America, a massive attack by an individual group of individuals that have Yemen nationality.
[02:57:01.128 --> 02:57:04.891]  And that's why they keep saying Trump will be gone by December.
[02:57:04.911 --> 02:57:08.674]  They're planning to get things so bad, we go, it's Trump's fault, get rid of him.
[02:57:09.454 --> 02:57:11.096]  I don't understand how they think this is going to work.
[02:57:12.150 --> 02:57:15.296]  Yeah, I mean, and Trump is doubling down.
[02:57:15.316 --> 02:57:16.458]  He hasn't been intimidated.
[02:57:16.478 --> 02:57:17.560]  If anything, it's fired him up.
[02:57:18.442 --> 02:57:23.992]  The symbolism of him taking off the business jacket, putting on the bomber jacket, and uttering the words, strategic patience.
[02:57:26.403 --> 02:57:39.974]  Well listen, Paul Watson's coming up, and I've got a few clips I've got to play before that happens, of stuff I promise to air, but you should come on, because I know you've got good information today, if you can, with Owen sometime and tomorrow.
[02:57:40.014 --> 02:57:41.355]  We should just get this happening now.
[02:57:41.675 --> 02:57:42.716]  So thank you so much, Zach.
[02:57:42.736 --> 02:57:43.357]  We put you on hold.
[02:57:43.377 --> 02:57:46.939]  I want to get you on with Owen, if you can do it, or David Knight tomorrow, as much as possible.
[02:57:47.199 --> 02:57:49.561]  I want you to flesh this out for folks, because you're dead on.
[02:57:49.882 --> 02:57:51.323]  We've got to be bracing for the new attacks.

[03:00:49.255 --> 03:00:53.017]  It's a critical time to fund the war effort against the globalists, especially now that we're in the thick of battle.
[03:00:57.847 --> 03:01:09.852]  Here is an important report by Gavin Wentz, dealing with the new Netflix series, marking the 100th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution, called Damnation, celebrating communist evil.
[03:01:10.372 --> 03:01:13.533]  So, it's all meant to coordinate with what you're about to witness in this country.
[03:01:13.573 --> 03:01:13.913]  Here it is.
[03:01:14.653 --> 03:01:20.296]  Today, Netflix releases the first episode of their new series, Damnation.
[03:01:20.696 --> 03:01:23.557]  Our banks and government have all conspired.
[03:01:25.057 --> 03:01:26.378]  I say we call that a miracle.
[03:01:32.825 --> 03:01:35.027]  This is a war between the people of this country.
[03:01:35.448 --> 03:01:39.392]  Those who side with wealth and power must be recognized for what they are.
[03:01:40.273 --> 03:01:40.833]  The enemy.
[03:01:40.853 --> 03:01:43.696]  Monsters, killers, murderers, drug killers.
[03:01:43.797 --> 03:01:45.779]  How they're organized in a common revolt.
[03:01:45.799 --> 03:01:46.960]  Then move to North Korea!
[03:01:46.980 --> 03:01:48.662]  Damn National Guard!
[03:01:52.147 --> 03:01:55.169]  So why am I talking about some silly Netflix show?
[03:01:55.389 --> 03:02:05.354]  The series was ordered into production of May of this year, and it's being produced by one of the producers of Game of Thrones, and they only gave them five months to produce the series.
[03:02:05.514 --> 03:02:08.815]  And why did it desperately need to be aired so soon?
[03:02:08.975 --> 03:02:10.616]  And why November 7th?
[03:02:11.056 --> 03:02:16.239]  Oh, because it promotes alt-left Antifa resist propaganda.
[03:02:16.559 --> 03:02:29.065]  It stars a preacher as the main character who goes around preaching and sparking up resentment and essentially a communist revolt amongst the working class during the 1930s.
[03:02:29.206 --> 03:02:35.849]  Not only is it anti-capitalism in nature, but the film is also about class warfare.
[03:02:36.109 --> 03:02:45.858]  This series is about the fight against the rich people and the fight against capitalism and those darn white racist people in America.
[03:02:46.058 --> 03:02:53.164]  So why should we be concerned about this new series that's pushing anti-capitalist pro-communist propaganda?
[03:02:53.504 --> 03:02:59.550]  It's because we live in America and we have a large amount of zombie idiots
[03:02:59.930 --> 03:03:16.601]  that subjectively will soak all of this BS into their minds and we will have more protesters out there on the streets hating America, hating capitalism, hating white people and hating rich people or people that they just perceive as racist.
[03:03:16.861 --> 03:03:18.743]  Alex Jones is a racist!
[03:03:19.003 --> 03:03:20.904]  Alex Jones is a racist!
[03:03:20.964 --> 03:03:27.829]  And of course, Damnation wouldn't be the alt-left series that it is today without feminist propaganda.
[03:03:28.409 --> 03:03:29.370]  Blessed are the meek.
[03:03:31.071 --> 03:03:32.502]  For they shall inherit the Earth.
[03:03:39.155 --> 03:03:48.339]  One, you have the preacher's wife who's discontented, distraught with being a housewife.
[03:03:48.439 --> 03:03:59.824]  I mean, she just makes those cakes too dry and she just can't live up to this role that she's supposed to be in because being a traditional woman, a mother, that's so unfulfilling.
[03:03:59.944 --> 03:04:04.606]  The second woman heroine character has a much more fulfilling role.
[03:04:04.946 --> 03:04:07.267]  She's an African-American prostitute.
[03:04:07.387 --> 03:04:10.508]  Wow, that's so much more fulfilling and invigorating.
[03:04:10.708 --> 03:04:18.591]  So being a whore and breaking from traditional roles by shooting up capitalists, industrialists, is so feminist.
[03:04:18.931 --> 03:04:28.935]  CNN even writes about the controversial series, acknowledging her hostility towards capitalism and its class warfare promoting nature.
[03:04:29.215 --> 03:04:42.340]  So essentially, Netflix hired some Game of Thrones producers to produce an anti-capitalist, essentially pro-communist series full of alt-left antifa propaganda.
[03:04:42.520 --> 03:04:52.064]  Okay, Netflix, since you dislike capitalism so much, then you shouldn't mind pro-capitalist Americans boycotting your stupid series.
[03:04:52.984 --> 03:04:53.685]  Absolutely.
[03:04:53.705 --> 03:04:56.346]  I mean, look, it basically celebrates what happened in Texas.
[03:04:57.165 --> 03:04:57.566]  And that's it.
[03:04:57.587 --> 03:04:59.633]  Just go out and kill a bunch of whites or kill Christians.
[03:05:00.316 --> 03:05:02.383]  But you're a woman, so it's cool when you blow people's heads off.
[03:05:05.154 --> 03:05:10.057]  New from Emmerich's Essentials, fragrance-free natural deodorant for your body care needs.
[03:05:10.858 --> 03:05:13.780]  Playing basketball in the dry summer heat really makes me sweat.
[03:05:14.460 --> 03:05:17.262]  To maintain my game, I need all the confidence I can get.
[03:05:17.883 --> 03:05:22.766]  That's why I use Emmerich's Essentials natural deodorant, made with organic ingredients.

[03:05:29.790 --> 03:05:34.894]  While shooting hoops, the last thing I want is sweaty armpits making my hands slippery and the ball wet.
[03:05:35.614 --> 03:05:39.057]  That's why I recommend Emmerich's Essentials Fragrance-Free Deodorant.
[03:05:39.617 --> 03:05:47.443]  Even though it's unscented, it's effective at combating strong body odor, and I don't have to worry about any unwanted allergic reactions to my sensitive skin.

[03:05:56.930 --> 03:06:00.733]  Stay in the game with Emmerich's Essentials Fragrance-Free Natural Deodorant.
[03:06:00.993 --> 03:06:02.654]  Available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:06:08.382 --> 03:06:11.883]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:06:12.443 --> 03:06:14.263]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:15.223 --> 03:06:18.244]  You can run on for a long time.
[03:06:18.924 --> 03:06:21.185]  Run on for a long time.
[03:06:21.845 --> 03:06:23.965]  Run on for a long time.
[03:06:23.985 --> 03:06:28.306]  All right, I'm handing the baton to Paul Joseph Watson, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:06:28.326 --> 03:06:35.928]  We're going to kick off a special 34-hour broadcast starting tomorrow to celebrate the big victory against the globalists that's now spreading worldwide.
[03:06:36.168 --> 03:06:37.008]  There's Paul Watson.
[03:06:38.058 --> 03:06:45.040]  Right there, ladies and gentlemen, in the bullpen, with explosive new information and documentation coming up.
[03:06:45.060 --> 03:06:47.140]  But first, I mention this a lot, I'm going to play it.
[03:06:47.620 --> 03:06:48.561]  I want to get this lady on.
[03:06:48.581 --> 03:06:49.921]  I only know her name is Miss Parker.
[03:06:50.621 --> 03:06:55.162]  Congressman flips out on pro-life activists after she schools him on abortion.
[03:06:55.202 --> 03:07:01.264]  I want to play this and then hand the baton to Paul Joseph Watson, our great editor of InfoWars.com.
[03:07:01.884 --> 03:07:06.705]  But first, here is a lady standing up for all human life, all red blood,
[03:07:07.145 --> 03:07:09.548]  Which unites us, a beautiful black lady.
[03:07:09.568 --> 03:07:12.592]  It's Congressman Cohen, he's called for me to be shut down.
[03:07:24.614 --> 03:07:38.089]  You brought a comparison between slavery and abortion, and as far as I recall, that's the first of that type of testimony that I have seen before this committee or any committee.
[03:07:39.251 --> 03:07:41.032]  Is that an original thought on your part?
[03:07:41.053 --> 03:07:44.136]  Have you had others that indexed the same comparison?
[03:07:44.636 --> 03:07:45.618]  How did this come about?
[03:07:46.576 --> 03:07:47.958]  Others have looked at it as well.
[03:07:48.178 --> 03:07:53.805]  In fact, when you put the Dred Scott decision next to the Roe v. Wade decision, they read almost verbatim.
[03:07:54.305 --> 03:08:01.534]  I'd like to also address something that was brought up earlier, if I may, when it comes to mixing the abortion issue with
[03:08:02.194 --> 03:08:04.935]  The challenges that we face in many of our hard-hit communities.
[03:08:05.135 --> 03:08:20.158]  I feel it disingenuous that the issues of Medicaid would come up and other opportunities for us to readdress what has happened and broken down in our most distressed zip codes the way that Planned Parenthood specifically targets these particular zip codes with abortion.
[03:08:20.578 --> 03:08:23.198]  Abortion is a leading cause of death in the black community today.
[03:08:23.638 --> 03:08:26.679]  Since Roe v. Wade was legalized 20 million
[03:08:27.699 --> 03:08:30.061]  Humans have been killed inside of the womb of black women.
[03:08:30.422 --> 03:08:37.689]  And then on Halloween, Planned Parenthood tweets out that the black women are safest if they abort their child rather than bring it to term.
[03:08:38.349 --> 03:08:45.857]  To the gentleman from Texas who brought up Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, I think that is important that we put in record.
[03:08:46.880 --> 03:08:52.324]  That the needs of those that are most vulnerable in society cannot be addressed with abortion.
[03:08:52.524 --> 03:08:57.708]  Abortion feeds a narrative that women are victims, that they have no control over their sexual impulses.
[03:08:58.048 --> 03:09:07.135]  And as a result of this narrative being forced down into our hardest-hit communities, we are seeing now recklessness in sexual activity and marriage has collapsed.
[03:09:07.535 --> 03:09:10.798]  In the 50s, 70% of black adults were married.
[03:09:11.018 --> 03:09:11.838]  Today that number is 30%.
[03:09:12.779 --> 03:09:19.001]  This is causing a lot more social pathologies that have to be addressed through different types of legislation, not the heartbeat bill.
[03:09:19.241 --> 03:09:21.082]  The heartbeat bill is to protect the innocent.
[03:09:22.062 --> 03:09:24.523]  Chair, I recognize the gentleman from Tennessee, the ranking member.
[03:09:24.543 --> 03:09:24.863]  Thank you.
[03:09:24.903 --> 03:09:28.004]  Firstly, we're in filler time, waiting for somebody to come testify.
[03:09:28.204 --> 03:09:29.565]  I would ask that we allow Ms.
[03:09:29.625 --> 03:09:33.987]  Jayapal to do filler, as well as the chair.
[03:09:34.227 --> 03:09:40.869]  And I'd also like to say that I am not disingenuous about anything I say about Medicaid or Medicare or LIHEAP.
[03:09:41.089 --> 03:09:44.731]  By the way, for sharecroppers and black women, many times they were forced to have abortions.
[03:10:08.183 --> 03:10:16.645]  But treating people like human garbage who can be picked or chosen to live or picked or chosen to die is the essence of slavery.
[03:10:16.945 --> 03:10:18.906]  Having no rights is slavery.
[03:10:20.886 --> 03:10:24.907]  And those condescending Democrats, I've never heard anyone equate it with racism.
[03:10:25.327 --> 03:10:25.648]  Really?
[03:10:26.848 --> 03:10:30.889]  Is that why Margaret Singer set it up to, quote, kill the subhuman black weeds, close quote?
[03:10:32.867 --> 03:10:38.551]  Or why Lyndon Baines Johnson funded it to break up black families so he could, quote, kill as many as those n-words in the womb as he could?
[03:10:38.571 --> 03:10:45.857]  Is that why MTV weaponized rap music into gangster rap and deployed it?
[03:10:45.937 --> 03:10:47.338]  That's all declassified!
[03:10:48.118 --> 03:10:58.146]  And Congressman Cohen of Tennessee joins Congressman Wigley of Illinois saying, shut Infowars down and ban my free speech.
[03:10:58.566 --> 03:11:01.108]  And he said we lied about FEMA camps
[03:11:02.955 --> 03:11:09.059]  And about the National Emergency Centers Act that he authored.
[03:11:11.600 --> 03:11:13.041]  These men prey on ignorance.
[03:11:14.102 --> 03:11:14.982]  These men are monsters.
[03:11:17.184 --> 03:11:18.584]  Paul Joseph Watson, take over, my friend.
[03:11:20.706 --> 03:11:21.326]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:11:21.386 --> 03:11:22.987]  Yeah, you mentioned the congressman.
[03:11:23.027 --> 03:11:27.630]  We got a big article up on Infowars.com right now because it was not only Twitter
[03:11:28.340 --> 03:11:46.908]  In that committee hearing which you played yesterday and today, not only Twitter that brazenly admitted they were censoring InfoWars, and again that's something that we might have glossed over, the fact that they have the general counsel of Twitter, a guy called Sean Edgett, responding to this congressman and saying basically, yeah,
[03:11:47.580 --> 03:11:59.246]  There was a tweet of an InfoWars article trending during the NYC terrorist attack on I think it was Wednesday last week and that was bad and we immediately shut it down and replaced it with mainstream media.
[03:11:59.526 --> 03:12:04.469]  He brazenly admitted that and basically said going forward that's exactly what they're going to do.
[03:12:05.009 --> 03:12:10.952]  Then we had another case on Sunday night when news was breaking about the Texas church massacre
[03:12:11.593 --> 03:12:16.337]  Where again, it was one of my tweets saying, look, this is the guy's LinkedIn page.
[03:12:16.377 --> 03:12:19.981]  He's into all these typically social justice type issues.
[03:12:20.301 --> 03:12:21.622]  It was his LinkedIn page.
[03:12:21.662 --> 03:12:22.603]  It wasn't fake news.
[03:12:23.124 --> 03:12:25.446]  That was at the top of some Google search result.
[03:12:26.058 --> 03:12:27.119]  For God knows how long.
[03:12:27.659 --> 03:12:29.541]  And they had an absolute meltdown.
[03:12:29.621 --> 03:12:33.024]  The left, the mainstream media, all these verified people on Twitter.
[03:12:33.544 --> 03:12:34.665]  Absolute meltdown.
[03:12:34.946 --> 03:12:37.768]  I didn't even know that it was the top of the Google search results.
[03:12:38.248 --> 03:12:41.131]  And by the way, Paul, they want to be the ruling class.
[03:12:41.611 --> 03:12:46.756]  And then in these incredible videos that you have in your article, they admit we're going to have AI censored people.
[03:12:47.996 --> 03:12:52.938]  The heads of Twitter and Google are saying, yes, we're aware that Paul Wyson's article was top-linked.
[03:12:52.978 --> 03:12:53.838]  We took it down.
[03:12:54.198 --> 03:12:57.239]  And then the congressman's like, well, you better move faster next time.
[03:12:57.660 --> 03:13:03.602]  And then it's a true story about a famous imam that goes on Fox News and warned of truck attacks, which happened.
[03:13:03.862 --> 03:13:06.562]  And then the Republican congressman says, this is actually a real article.
[03:13:06.963 --> 03:13:07.863]  What are you talking about?
[03:13:08.143 --> 03:13:11.385]  So Paul, this is so bombshell, and your article's been out for hours.
[03:13:11.705 --> 03:13:14.747]  I'm sorry I didn't report on it more, because we won't exist if we don't.
[03:13:15.027 --> 03:13:16.888]  The listeners have to get upset about this.
[03:13:17.209 --> 03:13:18.950]  The headline is, bombshell!
[03:13:19.889 --> 03:13:24.452]  Twitter, Google, Facebook admit plan to censor InfoWars.
[03:13:24.472 --> 03:13:26.153]  We'll put that back on screen, please.
[03:13:26.553 --> 03:13:32.837]  Because, again, we tend to look at all the other news, including myself, we look at news wars and InfoWars like we're chopped liver.
[03:13:33.237 --> 03:13:35.238]  This is a really, really important story.
[03:13:35.298 --> 03:13:36.359]  It needs to go everywhere.
[03:13:36.719 --> 03:13:37.800]  It's absolutely critical.
[03:13:37.860 --> 03:13:38.420]  Bombshell.
[03:13:38.720 --> 03:13:41.061]  Twitter, Google admit deliberately censoring InfoWars.
[03:13:41.582 --> 03:13:43.363]  Why are they so scared of us, Paul?
[03:13:45.222 --> 03:13:47.584]  Because we resonate far easier than they do.
[03:13:47.604 --> 03:13:49.285]  It's not rocket science.
[03:13:49.645 --> 03:13:56.230]  Just imagine how big we'd be, and we're not even that big at this point, but just imagine how big we would be if they didn't censor us.
[03:13:56.550 --> 03:13:58.651]  This is with all the algorithm changes.
[03:13:58.972 --> 03:14:00.313]  I've talked about it before, Alex.
[03:14:00.333 --> 03:14:09.059]  I used to search for InfoWars articles when I was writing articles to search for stuff that I'd written in the past that I could refer back to in my articles.
[03:14:09.499 --> 03:14:13.622]  Now, like, every other time I search my own name in InfoWars and then some other key terms,
[03:14:14.302 --> 03:14:17.325]  It's the Salon.com hit pieces right at the top.
[03:14:17.585 --> 03:14:21.628]  They've changed their entire algorithm to barriers to censors.
[03:14:21.948 --> 03:14:28.233]  And still, still we get to the top because we resonate with people and because people don't trust the mainstream media.
[03:14:28.253 --> 03:14:33.577]  They can never claw back that reputation, which is why they want even more severe censorship.
[03:14:34.037 --> 03:14:35.218]  And it all comes back to this.
[03:14:35.718 --> 03:14:39.339]  The Democrats, the left, created this whole fake news narrative.
[03:14:39.659 --> 03:14:40.960]  They created a moral panic.
[03:14:41.200 --> 03:14:44.822]  They weaponized it as an excuse because they lost the election.
[03:14:45.182 --> 03:14:51.664]  They're using that to censor alternate viewpoints, even alternate coverage of news, which is completely true.
[03:14:51.824 --> 03:14:55.166]  And Paul, Paul, Paul, they're so disconnected.
[03:14:56.175 --> 03:14:58.516]  They're going, yes, I saw him for us at the top at lunch.
[03:14:58.556 --> 03:14:59.257]  We took it down.
[03:14:59.497 --> 03:15:00.677]  He's like, good, do it quicker.
[03:15:00.938 --> 03:15:02.519]  I mean, it's sensational.
[03:15:03.019 --> 03:15:08.422]  It's like seeing the communist Chinese live time in their computers censoring Falun Gong.
[03:15:08.542 --> 03:15:10.603]  I mean, it's so sensational.
[03:15:11.003 --> 03:15:15.806]  Don't they get the Streisand effect that the more they try to suppress us, the more it explodes?
[03:15:16.892 --> 03:15:21.154]  Well you saw that a couple of weeks ago when YouTube put my video behind a censorship wall.
[03:15:21.855 --> 03:15:24.276]  Luckily we got someone within YouTube to take a look at it.
[03:15:24.736 --> 03:15:32.961]  After it came back out of censorship, after we saw the view count again, because of course they hide the view count when they censor it, it had got like 300,000 extra views.
[03:15:33.281 --> 03:15:34.202]  So they never learn.
[03:15:34.622 --> 03:15:38.224]  Now with this case, with what happened on Sunday night with the Texas church massacre,
[03:15:38.795 --> 03:15:42.058]  Gizmodo, all these other publications ranted, triggered about it.
[03:15:42.078 --> 03:15:45.982]  We'll get into it after the break on the Alex Jones Show Live fourth hour.
[03:15:46.523 --> 03:15:57.053]  We're going to talk about how they are not only censoring, but now it's going to get even more intense because even despite the censorship that's already going on, they're still losing.
[03:15:57.113 --> 03:15:58.415]  We're still defeating them.
[03:15:58.455 --> 03:16:00.617]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show Live fourth hour.
[03:16:00.637 --> 03:16:01.438]  Don't go away.
[03:16:11.528 --> 03:16:15.170]  Just briefly, my dad is an oral surgeon and dentist.
[03:16:15.210 --> 03:16:16.231]  He's about to retire.
[03:16:16.251 --> 03:16:23.315]  About 15 years ago, he heard me ranting and raving about fluoride and toothpaste and how it causes brain damage and lower IQ and dental fluorosis.
[03:16:23.415 --> 03:16:26.316]  He said, son, I don't care who you have on the air.
[03:16:26.336 --> 03:16:27.317]  That's a bunch of bull.
[03:16:27.837 --> 03:16:28.898]  You need fluoride or you die.
[03:16:29.478 --> 03:16:31.939]  And I actually showed him what was in the water supply in the Florida.
[03:16:31.959 --> 03:16:32.759]  He said, this is incredible.
[03:16:33.159 --> 03:16:35.159]  This is Grignard Reagent's heavy metals.
[03:16:35.380 --> 03:16:41.101]  They're covering for it, calling it Florida under law with a loophole to dump toxic waste in the food and water.
[03:16:41.681 --> 03:16:42.161]  Exactly.
[03:16:42.221 --> 03:16:48.203]  Now, CNN had to admit last month, in utero and in children, massive IQ reductions.
[03:16:48.263 --> 03:16:52.024]  Well, six years ago, the EPA said, reduce it in water by half.
[03:16:53.404 --> 03:16:54.744]  You don't drink your sunscreen.
[03:16:54.844 --> 03:16:56.925]  But hydrofluorosilicic acid is a
[03:16:57.927 --> 03:16:58.347]  I don't
[03:17:14.727 --> 03:17:18.268]  The American Dental Association says don't brush children's teeth until age six with it.
[03:17:18.728 --> 03:17:21.369]  Why does it say nursery water than at the store with added fluoride?
[03:17:21.689 --> 03:17:23.449]  And they didn't add calcium fluoride, boys.
[03:17:23.789 --> 03:17:26.150]  And girls, they added hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[03:17:26.350 --> 03:17:37.893]  That's why my dad and I developed, with the same folks that make Toms of Maine, it's private-labeled, super blue, non-fluoride toothpaste with colloidal silver and high-quality iodine, which you die without iodine.
[03:17:37.913 --> 03:17:39.473]  Massive iodine deficiencies in the country.
[03:17:39.493 --> 03:17:41.273]  If you drink the stuff that's at the store, it'll kill you.
[03:17:41.333 --> 03:17:42.234]  It's a different type of iodine.
[03:17:42.254 --> 03:17:43.654]  This is the real medical grade.
[03:17:44.094 --> 03:17:52.402]  It's 33% off right now, and we have the bubble gum, natural flavor, organic flavored for children, that doesn't have as much of the peppermint in it, because it says concentrated toothpaste.
[03:17:53.002 --> 03:17:56.385]  Super Blue Toothpaste, available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:18:02.090 --> 03:18:03.531]  After four years of research.
[03:18:04.747 --> 03:18:07.890]  The next big game-changer has arrived.
[03:18:08.670 --> 03:18:12.073]  Z-Shield, toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[03:18:12.694 --> 03:18:14.035]  It's made in the USA.
[03:18:14.555 --> 03:18:22.862]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body, and it supports the Infowar.
[03:18:23.283 --> 03:18:25.184]  It is a classical 360 win.
[03:18:25.504 --> 03:18:26.485]  We're changing the world.
[03:18:26.946 --> 03:18:30.629]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at Infowarslife.com.
[03:18:31.735 --> 03:18:32.816]  Take a look at this study.
[03:18:50.848 --> 03:18:55.874]  That we live in an environment that is just loaded with toxic chemicals.
[03:18:56.334 --> 03:19:02.481]  Now they're finding that that environment is actually affecting babies in the prenatal stage.
[03:19:02.781 --> 03:19:04.803]  Specifically when it comes to the telomeres.
[03:19:05.104 --> 03:19:09.689]  So now you have babies prematurely aging because of all the toxins.
[03:19:10.109 --> 03:19:11.610]  So what does InfoWars do, folks?
[03:19:11.910 --> 03:19:20.937]  We find a solution and we offer you the best, most groundbreaking product to deal with protecting and keeping your telomeres healthy.

[03:19:58.164 --> 03:20:08.036]  Infowarsstore.com You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:28.198 --> 03:20:34.441]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:36.983 --> 03:20:39.524]  We are live, it is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:39.564 --> 03:20:42.826]  We're talking about this article which is up on Infowars.com right now.
[03:20:43.606 --> 03:20:46.708]  Bombshell Twitter, Google admit deliberately censoring Infowars.
[03:20:46.748 --> 03:20:55.332]  We talk about internet censorship, social media censorship constantly on this show because we continue to have to battle it on a weekly basis.
[03:20:56.201 --> 03:21:06.450]  Kind of gets, uh, people get jaded, they don't really respond to it, but the fact that we have to continue battling this same tedious issue, week after week after week, kind of...
[03:21:07.170 --> 03:21:10.411]  derails us from pushing our main narrative, but it has to be done.
[03:21:10.591 --> 03:21:16.073]  Because if we didn't, then we'd just fold over and they'd completely censor us into oblivion.
[03:21:16.533 --> 03:21:26.637]  Now, of course, this emerged out of a House Intelligence Committee hearing into Russian meddling in the presidential election, for which there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever.
[03:21:27.117 --> 03:21:34.100]  But it was a Democratic congressman who was basically triggered by the fact that during the New York City terrorist attack in Manhattan last week,
[03:21:35.160 --> 03:21:46.771]  An Infowars.com article came up near the top or at the top of their trending hashtag, which of course was specifically selected by Twitter, so it was a particularly big one during that time period.
[03:21:47.412 --> 03:22:00.676]  And the article was about an imam who said he warned Mayor de Blasio in New York about terror radicalization in New York City, and of course he later provided the letter showing that he warned him.
[03:22:00.976 --> 03:22:10.079]  The imam's claim was that the Mayor de Blasio, who of course we know went to hang out basically with Antifa in Hamburg, Germany a few months ago during that riot,
[03:22:11.255 --> 03:22:23.179]  His claim was that de Blasio was more concerned about bashing Trump, criticising Trump, than focusing on the very terror radicalisation process that was taking place in his own city.
[03:22:23.780 --> 03:22:24.100]  OK?
[03:22:24.641 --> 03:22:27.463]  Nothing fake about that news.
[03:22:28.084 --> 03:22:36.972]  Was there an imam that made a claim that he warned de Blasio and that, in his opinion, de Blasio ignored it because he was more concerned with bashing Trump?
[03:22:37.292 --> 03:22:38.433]  Yes, yes, yes.
[03:22:38.993 --> 03:22:39.874]  Completely true.
[03:22:40.355 --> 03:22:41.756]  That's not fake news.
[03:22:42.457 --> 03:22:50.884]  Fake news is when actual fake news websites make up completely inane, insane stories about stuff that provably never happened.
[03:22:51.728 --> 03:22:59.933]  There was one last week about Katy Perry saying that I think it was something like necrophilia was good or eating corpses was good or something, OK?
[03:23:00.253 --> 03:23:01.374]  That's fake news.
[03:23:02.134 --> 03:23:14.161]  Reporting accurately on what a top imam, who's verified on Twitter, got a huge following, said during that New York City terrorist attack, reporting on what he said is not fake news.
[03:23:15.382 --> 03:23:16.583]  You can argue and say, well,
[03:23:17.443 --> 03:23:19.563]  De Blasio probably has a lot of things to focus on.
[03:23:19.583 --> 03:23:20.464]  He didn't ignore it.
[03:23:20.504 --> 03:23:23.744]  But you can't argue that this imam didn't make that claim.
[03:23:24.144 --> 03:23:25.305]  That's not fake news.
[03:23:25.965 --> 03:23:32.426]  In fact, in these clips that we've already played, the Republican congressman comes back and says, that's completely subjective.
[03:23:32.806 --> 03:23:37.987]  You can't just say something's fake news because it makes Mayor De Blasio look bad, OK?
[03:23:38.467 --> 03:23:39.468]  That's not how it works.
[03:23:39.728 --> 03:23:41.408]  But it is how it works for the Democrats.
[03:23:41.448 --> 03:23:44.029]  It's why they created the term in the first place.
[03:23:44.329 --> 03:23:45.769]  That's why they weaponized it.
[03:23:46.369 --> 03:23:57.132]  And I flashed back today on Twitter to an article out of the Observer with the headline, Stanford Study Finds Fake News Didn't Tip Election Against Clinton.
[03:23:57.752 --> 03:24:15.656]  They did a huge study, Stanford University, not only did they find that fake news didn't impact the election, didn't have enough reach to impact the election, but the top fake news stories, the top two fake news stories that were actually proven fake and had the most traffic during the election period,
[03:24:16.323 --> 03:24:18.084]  benefited Hillary Clinton.
[03:24:18.885 --> 03:24:21.387]  They were Hillary Clinton positive stories.
[03:24:21.927 --> 03:24:26.571]  Most people who believed them, they were the two biggest news stories that most people believed.
[03:24:26.651 --> 03:24:27.712]  Fake news stories.
[03:24:28.252 --> 03:24:30.054]  They were both pro-Hillary Clinton.
[03:24:30.514 --> 03:24:36.079]  So this entire narrative that fake news helped Donald Trump win, complete BS.
[03:24:36.399 --> 03:24:38.200]  If anything, it helped Hillary Clinton.
[03:24:38.220 --> 03:24:40.282]  That's not Infowars saying that.
[03:24:40.682 --> 03:24:42.564]  Stanford University.
[03:24:43.204 --> 03:24:45.366]  Yet they still push this narrative.
[03:24:46.044 --> 03:25:07.138]  And of course they all ganged up on us again on Sunday night, as I mentioned during the Texas church massacre, when one of my tweets temporarily got to the top of Google search rankings, which was a post, one of them was about the fact that the shooter posted an image of what looked like an AR-15 on his Facebook page, completely true.
[03:25:07.739 --> 03:25:11.001]  Another one was a screenshot from his LinkedIn page, completely true.
[03:25:11.721 --> 03:25:15.804]  And Gizmodo and all these other verified liberals on Twitter had an absolute meltdown.
[03:25:16.491 --> 03:25:20.633]  I said to them, look, 26 people have just been brutally massacred.
[03:25:20.773 --> 03:25:21.794]  Could have been way more.
[03:25:22.154 --> 03:25:26.537]  And your first concern is who gets the most traffic on Twitter.
[03:25:27.897 --> 03:25:29.338]  That was their first concern.
[03:25:29.638 --> 03:25:31.599]  I didn't even know about it until the next day.
[03:25:31.619 --> 03:25:33.740]  I didn't know my tweets were top of Google.
[03:25:33.760 --> 03:25:34.461]  I don't care.
[03:25:35.239 --> 03:25:36.260]  There's no strategy.
[03:25:36.300 --> 03:25:37.621]  I didn't know it until the next day.
[03:25:38.021 --> 03:25:45.546]  So then the New York Times contacted me last night and said, oh, what's your strategy for getting your tweets to the top of Google search rankings?
[03:25:45.946 --> 03:25:47.387]  I responded, I don't have one.
[03:25:48.247 --> 03:25:53.310]  I didn't even know until they all freaked out about it in these news reports that I read the next day.
[03:25:53.711 --> 03:25:55.192]  There is no strategy.
[03:25:55.532 --> 03:25:57.173]  I'm not gaming the algorithm.
[03:25:57.413 --> 03:26:01.776]  I'm simply making interesting, newsworthy, timely tweets.
[03:26:03.268 --> 03:26:09.252]  Now some people came out in the immediate aftermath of the shooting before we knew the facts and they were speculating as to the motive and whatever.
[03:26:09.312 --> 03:26:10.413]  I wasn't even doing that.
[03:26:10.433 --> 03:26:18.058]  I was just reporting on what I was seeing from the live media coverage from all the different reporters that were covering it.
[03:26:18.459 --> 03:26:19.679]  The Fox News live stream.
[03:26:19.719 --> 03:26:20.600]  That's all I was doing.
[03:26:21.861 --> 03:26:26.324]  And all the people trying to find his social media history while they were deleting it in real time.
[03:26:26.364 --> 03:26:27.545]  That's all I was doing.
[03:26:28.211 --> 03:26:32.074]  Wasn't trying to spin a narrative, was just covering a breaking news story.
[03:26:32.094 --> 03:26:32.535]  That was it.
[03:26:33.095 --> 03:26:36.378]  And so it got to the top of Google Twitter search results.
[03:26:37.118 --> 03:26:38.219]  And they all freaked out.
[03:26:38.599 --> 03:26:40.001]  Because again, they don't resonate.
[03:26:40.441 --> 03:26:45.925]  Not only do they not have a strategy for getting their content out, nobody's interested in their content.
[03:26:46.426 --> 03:26:56.634]  Because they don't trust the mainstream media, and because they lie, and because they just don't have the knack of resonating and knowing what people are going to be interested in when those kind of breaking news events happen.
[03:26:58.610 --> 03:27:05.852]  And again, the whole fake news thing was a moral panic created by the Democrats as yet another excuse for them losing the election.
[03:27:06.072 --> 03:27:10.373]  It's been proven to have not had any impact on the election.
[03:27:11.793 --> 03:27:21.356]  Let's read from the actual study, as told in this Observer article, Stanford study finds fake news didn't tip election against Clinton.
[03:27:22.623 --> 03:27:37.792]  Alcott and Gentzkow, who were the two main researchers, said, our data suggests social media were not the most important source of election news and even the most widely circulated fake news stories were seen by only a fraction, small fraction, of Americans.
[03:27:38.132 --> 03:27:50.159]  For fake news to have changed the outcome of the election, a single fake news story would need to have convinced about 0.7% of Clinton voters and non-voters who saw it to shift their votes to Trump, they added.
[03:27:50.802 --> 03:28:00.291]  For fake news to have changed the outcome of the election, a single fake article would need to have had the same persuasive effect as 36 television campaign ads.
[03:28:00.351 --> 03:28:09.580]  And they say, and it's a sub-headline of the article, ironically, the most widely believed fake news stories were those that benefited Hillary Clinton.
[03:28:10.240 --> 03:28:15.105]  So again, they can spin this narrative for as long as they like that fake news won Trump the election.
[03:28:15.791 --> 03:28:37.445]  Yes, there is fake news, but it's easy to tell the difference between somebody's opinion about something, as the congressman, the Republican congressman Chris Stewart said in those videos, it's easy to tell between opinion, a certain take on different breaking news events, and outright, contrived, obviously phony fake news.
[03:28:38.231 --> 03:28:44.378]  They've conflated the two to try and silence and censor voices that make them look bad.
[03:28:44.618 --> 03:28:50.624]  That's what it's all about and they're still pushing this narrative now even at a Congressional House committee level.
[03:28:51.285 --> 03:28:53.627]  We'll be back on the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:53.667 --> 03:28:54.869]  More breaking news coming soon.
[03:28:55.529 --> 03:28:57.111]  InfoWars.com.
[03:28:57.231 --> 03:28:57.812]  Don't go away.
[03:29:02.657 --> 03:29:06.978]  We're very proud of the fact here at InfoWars that we're a teleprompter-free operation.
[03:29:07.438 --> 03:29:12.479]  We don't get our talking points from the private Federal Reserve or from Nazi collaborators like George Soros.
[03:29:13.019 --> 03:29:16.939]  We get our talking points from common sense and research from we the people.
[03:29:16.979 --> 03:29:20.280]  That means our guests, our researchers, you the listeners, the callers.
[03:29:20.940 --> 03:29:25.401]  But that said, today I've got a script I'm going to follow for the first time ever.
[03:29:26.021 --> 03:29:29.282]  It's you the listeners, the viewers, that wrote my talking points.
[03:29:29.982 --> 03:29:31.522]  I came in here an hour ago.
[03:29:32.282 --> 03:29:39.504]  And I literally just went to Infowarsstore.com and printed the 5-star reviews, the first few pages.
[03:29:39.804 --> 03:29:43.606]  These are in the order of how they've been posted by you, the listeners.
[03:29:44.206 --> 03:29:47.667]  And it's 5-star after 5-star after 5-star.
[03:29:48.027 --> 03:29:49.727]  It's amazing from third-party sites.
[03:29:50.188 --> 03:29:56.510]  So, this is what you, the listeners and viewers, have to say about the products at Infowarslife.com.
[03:29:56.550 --> 03:29:57.450]  Let's go over them right now.
[03:29:57.990 --> 03:29:59.511]  This is verified by our Mark.
[03:29:59.711 --> 03:30:02.652]  Five-star review for AnthroPlex for men and women.
[03:30:03.132 --> 03:30:04.172]  I take it as directed.
[03:30:04.192 --> 03:30:15.075]  As one uses it too much, it will cause reflections of adolescent years and skin and muscle and hair growth will of course increase sex drive as a given.
[03:30:15.636 --> 03:30:16.316]  Easy does it.
[03:30:16.396 --> 03:30:17.416]  Yeah, it's hardcore.
[03:30:17.436 --> 03:30:18.397]  It's very, very serious.
[03:30:18.797 --> 03:30:19.217]  Not a game.
[03:30:19.237 --> 03:30:19.637]  Thank you, Mark.
[03:30:20.157 --> 03:30:21.458]  Here's another one from Patrick.
[03:30:21.579 --> 03:30:22.359]  Energy all day.
[03:30:22.379 --> 03:30:30.106]  I use this along with Supermail and it makes me have driving energy all day on my 12 to 14 hour day.
[03:30:30.547 --> 03:30:31.268]  Another review.
[03:30:31.288 --> 03:30:32.269]  I love this one.
[03:30:32.589 --> 03:30:35.031]  Keeps my husband going and going and going.
[03:30:35.411 --> 03:30:38.935]  This must be the stuff the Energizer Bunny is on.
[03:30:39.195 --> 03:30:42.118]  I guess that's some fine lady using her husband Adam's account.
[03:30:42.498 --> 03:30:44.040]  Here's another one ladies and gentlemen.
[03:30:44.421 --> 03:30:47.785]  Five star review for Winter Sun Vitamin D3.
[03:30:48.065 --> 03:30:51.249]  This product is amazing and will keep you from the winter blues.
[03:30:51.309 --> 03:30:56.035]  I don't get sick last winter while I was taking this for the first time in my life.
[03:30:56.175 --> 03:30:57.156]  Amazing product.
[03:30:57.877 --> 03:30:59.958]  Again, tastes good as well, they say.
[03:31:00.378 --> 03:31:01.399]  Here's one from Brian.
[03:31:01.699 --> 03:31:03.780]  I love this product and I live in Wisconsin.
[03:31:03.900 --> 03:31:04.741]  Thank you all.
[03:31:05.141 --> 03:31:08.803]  It's time that we turn the clocks back and lose the sunshine.
[03:31:08.863 --> 03:31:11.084]  I love this product and I am a night owl.
[03:31:11.464 --> 03:31:13.405]  Every night owl should have this product.
[03:31:13.905 --> 03:31:17.367]  I will buy this product as soon as possible again.
[03:31:17.607 --> 03:31:18.268]  And I should add,
[03:31:19.068 --> 03:31:20.189]  That's a great name for this product.
[03:31:20.449 --> 03:31:22.270]  Not just for the winter, but for night owls as well.
[03:31:22.290 --> 03:31:24.011]  In fact, it should probably be called Night Owl.
[03:31:24.351 --> 03:31:25.672]  Night Owl's Winter Sun.
[03:31:25.752 --> 03:31:27.353]  Or, Night Owls Get Sun in the Winter.
[03:31:27.393 --> 03:31:27.953]  Okay, I'm going to stop.
[03:31:28.213 --> 03:31:28.974]  I said I'd shut up!
[03:31:29.814 --> 03:31:30.635]  But back to the script.
[03:31:30.995 --> 03:31:32.876]  Liquid Sunshine is what they call it.
[03:31:32.896 --> 03:31:33.636]  I love that name too.
[03:31:34.077 --> 03:31:36.098]  I will be using this product for two years now.
[03:31:36.398 --> 03:31:40.600]  It's wonderful out in the Pacific Northwest to get this Liquid Sunshine.
[03:31:40.640 --> 03:31:43.222]  Patrick, thank you for the support and for the review.
[03:31:43.282 --> 03:31:44.702]  You make it literally possible.
[03:31:45.763 --> 03:31:50.569]  Continuing with Silver Bullet, the highest quality, 30 parts per million colloidal silver out there.
[03:31:51.109 --> 03:31:53.932]  Dale, should be called Magic Bullet.
[03:31:54.213 --> 03:31:57.757]  Oh my gosh, the listeners are so much smarter than me and I'm not being patronizing.
[03:31:58.277 --> 03:32:00.500]  I've been, that's what a Silver Bullet's supposed to be though.
[03:32:01.501 --> 03:32:03.982]  I've been using Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver for years now.
[03:32:04.342 --> 03:32:06.444]  This was the first product I purchased from Inforestore.
[03:32:06.784 --> 03:32:12.648]  Whenever I feel the first hazes of cold or sore throat coming on, a dose of Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has always ended it before it starts.
[03:32:13.068 --> 03:32:18.812]  I've been giving it away for family and Christmas and birthdays since 2015 and it's worked for everyone.
[03:32:19.292 --> 03:32:25.677]  It has become an expected gift for our family and that's why we get you the best products because we want to repeat customers.
[03:32:25.937 --> 03:32:26.757]  It's all a win-win.
[03:32:26.918 --> 03:32:27.818]  That's an awesome review.
[03:32:27.858 --> 03:32:30.640]  Thank you, Dale, for your support and for what you've done for your family.
[03:32:31.080 --> 03:32:33.121]  Well, I got 20 seconds left, folks.
[03:32:33.181 --> 03:32:36.143]  I can't get to all the other Silver Bullet reviews, the Caveman reviews.
[03:32:36.163 --> 03:32:37.343]  They're all five-star.
[03:32:37.604 --> 03:32:43.527]  They talk about the meal replacement, how great it is, how it blows them away post-workout, pre-workout.
[03:32:43.587 --> 03:32:46.888]  Taste, you know, okay, they say, but it's the results that really matter.
[03:32:47.168 --> 03:32:48.969]  Best post-workout ever is what Andrew says.
[03:32:49.269 --> 03:32:52.791]  Find it all, folks, at InfoWarsTore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.

[03:34:42.574 --> 03:34:45.536]  They had an absolute meltdown a few days ago.
[03:34:45.616 --> 03:34:52.321]  They found an ad that I had cut for Brainforce, which by the way you should also get in 4WarsStore.com.
[03:34:52.341 --> 03:34:54.642]  Always use the opportunity to promote it even more.
[03:34:55.223 --> 03:34:58.705]  They had a meltdown over an ad that I cut in April.
[03:34:59.975 --> 03:35:01.216]  What are we now, November?
[03:35:01.236 --> 03:35:10.621]  Like six, seven months ago in April, I got an ad for Brainforce and they found it like it was some secret and they were like, oh my God, this is the funniest thing ever.
[03:35:11.261 --> 03:35:28.651]  So they literally had an autistic screeching fit over an ad of me promoting Brainforce, which is a new tropic, which like literally half the people in Silicon Valley take, which everybody has their different brand of, oh, but when InfoWars does it, it's bad and it's funny somehow.
[03:35:29.804 --> 03:35:37.448]  If that's the best they've got, we advertise products that got five-star independent reviews that you see right there on InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:35:37.848 --> 03:35:38.889]  BrainForce Plus.
[03:35:39.309 --> 03:35:41.370]  They had an absolute meltdown!
[03:35:41.430 --> 03:35:42.511]  It was hilarious!
[03:35:43.311 --> 03:35:54.237]  They were so triggered by the fact that they found this ad, which has been on the internet for like nearly half a year, of me talking about how BrainForce gives you mental clarity and more energy.
[03:35:55.098 --> 03:35:58.580]  They wrote it on Vice.com!
[03:36:00.247 --> 03:36:02.148]  This ad is six months old.
[03:36:02.668 --> 03:36:15.133]  Listen, if this is the best they've got against yours truly, that I advertised Brain Force six months ago, it's like everybody in Silicon Valley takes some kind of nootropic.
[03:36:15.613 --> 03:36:18.474]  This isn't like some hokey snake oil.
[03:36:19.055 --> 03:36:25.477]  I mean, Joe Rogan built his entire podcast on selling his version of the exact same product.
[03:36:26.017 --> 03:36:27.698]  You're going to go after Joe Rogan too?
[03:36:28.897 --> 03:36:35.180]  Absolutely incredible that they had all these massive hissy fits over me making an ad for Brainforce.
[03:36:35.220 --> 03:36:37.361]  Well, here I'm making another one right now.
[03:36:37.721 --> 03:36:38.882]  Gonna get triggered over this?
[03:36:38.962 --> 03:36:39.182]  Good.
[03:36:39.462 --> 03:36:40.762]  We'll sell even more bottles of it.
[03:36:40.943 --> 03:36:45.665]  You're literally making Infowars and me money with your autistic hissy fits.
[03:36:45.945 --> 03:36:50.807]  Carry on with your autistic screeching, because it's a lot funnier from my perspective.
[03:36:51.574 --> 03:36:55.056]  If that's all you've got, it's quite pathetic at this point.
[03:36:55.456 --> 03:36:57.136]  Get your BrainForce right now.
[03:36:57.577 --> 03:36:58.497]  BrainForce Plus.
[03:36:58.877 --> 03:37:02.038]  Personally recommended by me at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:37:02.559 --> 03:37:05.260]  In fact, stock up simply because of those articles.
[03:37:05.280 --> 03:37:06.960]  You remember the BuzzFeed hit piece?
[03:37:07.541 --> 03:37:09.421]  Which made us a ton of money, by the way.
[03:37:09.461 --> 03:37:10.202]  Thanks, BuzzFeed.
[03:37:10.822 --> 03:37:11.422]  Do the same.
[03:37:11.902 --> 03:37:15.204]  Get your BrainForce right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:37:16.104 --> 03:37:17.905]  Directly recommended by me, okay?
[03:37:18.085 --> 03:37:19.225]  And proud of it, alright?
[03:37:19.926 --> 03:37:20.286]  There you go.
[03:37:21.488 --> 03:37:25.310]  So we're going to turn back to the massacre in Texas.
[03:37:26.451 --> 03:37:29.252]  Absolutely chilling details coming out about that today.
[03:37:29.913 --> 03:37:43.640]  First, though, I want to go to this Trump clip where he's talking about the fact that possibly hundreds more people, if this shooter had been allowed to continue his rampage, would have been dead right now, if not for a responsible person with a firearm.
[03:37:43.660 --> 03:37:44.581]  Let's go to that clip.
[03:37:45.717 --> 03:37:54.562]  You've talked about wanting to put extreme vetting on people trying to come into the United States, but I wonder if you would consider extreme vetting for people trying to buy a gun?
[03:37:55.042 --> 03:38:05.729]  Well, you know, you're bringing up a situation that probably shouldn't be discussed too much right now, but it's okay if you feel that that's an appropriate question, even though we're the heart of South Korea.
[03:38:06.069 --> 03:38:07.630]  If you did what you're suggesting,
[03:38:08.570 --> 03:38:11.051]  There would have been no difference three days ago.
[03:38:11.811 --> 03:38:23.136]  And you might not have had that very brave person who happened to have a gun or a rifle in his truck go out and shoot him and hit him and neutralize him.
[03:38:24.496 --> 03:38:34.660]  And I can only say this, if he didn't have a gun, instead of having 26 dead, he would have had hundreds more dead.
[03:38:35.154 --> 03:38:37.757]  And are you considering any kind of gun control policy going forward?
[03:38:37.777 --> 03:38:43.283]  Can you look at the city with the strongest gun laws in our nation is Chicago.
[03:38:43.303 --> 03:38:45.946]  And Chicago is a disaster.
[03:38:46.307 --> 03:38:54.336]  If this man didn't have a gun or a rifle, you'd be talking about a much worse situation in the great state of Texas.
[03:38:55.481 --> 03:38:59.984]  So there's Trump today in South Korea talking about the Texas church massacre.
[03:39:00.004 --> 03:39:01.265]  Of course, he mentioned Chicago.
[03:39:01.285 --> 03:39:02.866]  I actually worked it out yesterday.
[03:39:03.266 --> 03:39:06.588]  They've had so many gun deaths, and this is just gun deaths alone.
[03:39:06.628 --> 03:39:08.710]  It's not even including all the other murders.
[03:39:09.690 --> 03:39:18.636]  If you take it, if you take the numbers from the Texas church massacre, which are tragic, but 26 dead last time we checked, 10 victims are still critical.
[03:39:18.676 --> 03:39:21.398]  That number could go higher, but 26 victims dead.
[03:39:22.037 --> 03:39:33.000]  So this year alone, Chicago has had almost 22, the equivalent of 22 Texas church massacres, simply from people who have been murdered with guns.
[03:39:33.701 --> 03:39:43.904]  And as Trump said, highest, most stringent, strictest gun control regulations in the country, which suggests to you that it's more of a culture issue than a gun issue.
[03:39:44.514 --> 03:39:50.941]  Now, of course, the immediate narrative after the massacre was being spewed from all sides by the verified Liberals once again.
[03:39:51.161 --> 03:39:53.123]  The NRA is a terrorist group!
[03:39:53.764 --> 03:39:54.524]  Ban the NRA!
[03:39:54.544 --> 03:39:56.426]  Don't just ban guns, ban the NRA!
[03:39:56.446 --> 03:40:03.674]  Well, it turns out, of course, armed citizen who helped stop Texas Church massacre was a former NRA member.
[03:40:04.034 --> 03:40:05.556]  And bang goes your narrative.
[03:40:05.916 --> 03:40:06.637]  Deflated.
[03:40:06.837 --> 03:40:07.157]  Gone.
[03:40:07.398 --> 03:40:07.698]  Done.
[03:40:08.456 --> 03:40:14.218]  We're hearing a lot about the evil NRA in the wake of the Texas church shooting which left 26 people dead.
[03:40:14.538 --> 03:40:19.380]  In the eyes of the left, it's the National Rifle Association that shoulders the blame for the carnage.
[03:40:19.941 --> 03:40:21.301]  And you saw all the tweets.
[03:40:21.321 --> 03:40:24.402]  15, 20, 25,000 retweets.
[03:40:24.683 --> 03:40:25.863]  They're all viral.
[03:40:25.963 --> 03:40:26.803]  Ban the NRA.
[03:40:26.823 --> 03:40:28.164]  It's a terrorist organisation.
[03:40:28.909 --> 03:40:30.110]  Except that's not true at all.
[03:40:30.150 --> 03:40:33.734]  In fact, the NRA should be praised for doing exactly what it actually does.
[03:40:34.095 --> 03:40:37.658]  Training people how to properly and safely use firearms.
[03:40:38.119 --> 03:40:50.452]  And of course, Stephen Williford is being credited, he's being hailed, rightly so, as the hero for helping to bring Sunday's mass shooting to an end as at least one round from his rifle found a small gap
[03:40:51.101 --> 03:40:57.463]  In the perpetrator's body armor and caused the killer to drop his weapon and retreat to his vehicle.
[03:40:57.503 --> 03:40:59.364]  And of course, that's when they had the big chase.
[03:41:00.004 --> 03:41:05.506]  Before the police even arrived, there was also another individual, another gun owner, shooting at him.
[03:41:06.386 --> 03:41:09.967]  He drove away, crashed into a ditch and ended up killing himself.
[03:41:10.007 --> 03:41:17.510]  So an NRA member, an armed, responsible NRA member with a gun, stopped this massacre from being even worse.
[03:41:18.433 --> 03:41:18.853]  Remember what?
[03:41:18.873 --> 03:41:24.418]  There are at least 50 people in that church who could have been slaughtered.
[03:41:24.438 --> 03:41:30.883]  26 is way bad enough, but it could have been a lot, lot worse if not for this armed, responsible individual.
[03:41:32.465 --> 03:41:40.992]  Now, speaking of this incident, and after the break, we're going to play my video, which I put up yesterday, which asks the pertinent questions which have yet to be answered.
[03:41:42.521 --> 03:41:43.042]  Imagine this.
[03:41:43.062 --> 03:41:44.983]  This is the scenario I painted in the video.
[03:41:45.003 --> 03:41:55.834]  So imagine if an Islamophobe, somebody who hates Muslims, is on Facebook for days and weeks beforehand posting how stupid Islam is, how much he hates Muslims.
[03:41:56.194 --> 03:42:03.121]  He's posting that over and over again to the point where his own friends are blocking him on Facebook because he just won't shut up about it.
[03:42:03.681 --> 03:42:06.584]  Then, a few days later, he goes into a mosque
[03:42:07.108 --> 03:42:13.930]  And tries to massacre 50 Muslims, having told us all about how much he hated Muslims over the past several days and weeks.
[03:42:14.450 --> 03:42:18.791]  How do you think the media would react after finding that out?
[03:42:19.131 --> 03:42:29.154]  Would they consider for a second that his motive could have been something to do with the fact that he hated Muslims, or would they still call it a mystery?
[03:42:29.974 --> 03:42:34.475]  Well that's exactly what happened in the case of this shooter in Texas,
[03:42:35.586 --> 03:42:42.050]  He posted anti-Christian, basically, hate speech on Facebook for days and weeks beforehand.
[03:42:42.390 --> 03:42:43.431]  He went into a church.
[03:42:43.711 --> 03:42:47.233]  He massacred 26 people, tried to kill even more.
[03:42:48.114 --> 03:42:49.675]  Oh, but it's a domestic dispute.
[03:42:50.435 --> 03:42:51.776]  There's no real evidence for that.
[03:42:51.816 --> 03:42:58.521]  He sent a mean text message, I think, to his mother-in-law, but they're not even considering the fact this could be an anti-Christian hate crime.
[03:42:58.541 --> 03:42:59.961]  We'll get more into that after the break.
[03:42:59.981 --> 03:43:01.522]  Breaking news at infowars.com.
[03:43:01.542 --> 03:43:02.103]  Don't go away.

[03:43:20.376 --> 03:43:25.078]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[03:43:39.223 --> 03:43:46.086]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:43:46.246 --> 03:43:50.607]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[03:44:17.828 --> 03:44:19.789]  O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[03:44:20.170 --> 03:44:21.710]  B vitamins we need every day.
[03:44:21.971 --> 03:44:27.053]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[03:44:27.233 --> 03:44:28.934]  O-O-O-Optimal absorption.
[03:44:29.594 --> 03:44:34.717]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[03:44:35.217 --> 03:44:35.537]  Secret 12.
[03:44:35.597 --> 03:44:36.378]  O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[03:44:37.038 --> 03:44:37.599]  I think so.
[03:45:11.346 --> 03:45:11.836]  Just briefly.
[03:45:13.078 --> 03:45:14.958]  My dad is an oral surgeon and dentist.
[03:45:14.998 --> 03:45:15.979]  He's about to retire.
[03:45:15.999 --> 03:45:22.960]  And about 15 years ago, he heard me ranting and raving about fluoride and toothpaste and how it causes brain damage and lower IQ and dental fluorosis.
[03:45:23.020 --> 03:45:26.101]  And he said, son, I don't care who you have on the air.
[03:45:26.121 --> 03:45:27.121]  That's a bunch of bull.
[03:45:27.622 --> 03:45:28.722]  You need fluoride or you die.
[03:45:29.262 --> 03:45:31.743]  And I actually showed him what was in the water supply and the fluoride.
[03:45:31.763 --> 03:45:32.543]  He said, this is incredible.
[03:45:32.963 --> 03:45:34.943]  This is Grignard Reagent's heavy metals.
[03:45:34.983 --> 03:45:40.865]  They're covering for it, calling it fluoride under law with a loophole to dump toxic waste in the food and water.
[03:45:41.465 --> 03:45:41.946]  Exactly.
[03:45:42.006 --> 03:45:47.995]  Now, CNN had to admit last month, in utero and in children, massive IQ reductions.
[03:45:48.055 --> 03:45:51.841]  Well, six years ago, the EPA said reduce it in water by half.
[03:45:53.203 --> 03:45:56.728]  You don't drink your sunscreen, but hydrofluorosilicic acid is a
[03:45:57.765 --> 03:45:58.045]  I don't
[03:46:14.522 --> 03:46:18.064]  The American Dental Association says don't brush children's teeth until age six with it.
[03:46:18.504 --> 03:46:21.026]  Why does it say nursery water than at the store with added fluoride?
[03:46:21.046 --> 03:46:23.927]  And they didn't add calcium fluoride, boys and girls.
[03:46:23.967 --> 03:46:25.948]  They added hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[03:46:26.148 --> 03:46:35.894]  That's why my dad and I developed, with the same folks that make Toms of Maine, it's private labeled, Super Blue non-fluoride toothpaste with colloidal silver and high-quality iodine.
[03:46:36.474 --> 03:46:37.695]  But you die without iodine.
[03:46:37.715 --> 03:46:39.276]  Massive iodine deficiencies in the country.
[03:46:39.296 --> 03:46:41.057]  If you drink the stuff that's at the store, it'll kill you.
[03:46:41.097 --> 03:46:42.037]  That's a different type of iodine.
[03:46:42.057 --> 03:46:43.458]  This is the real medical grade.
[03:46:43.658 --> 03:46:52.181]  It's 33% off right now, and we have the bubble gum, natural flavor, organic flavored for children, that doesn't have as much of the peppermint in it, because it says concentrated toothpaste.
[03:46:52.781 --> 03:46:56.142]  Super Blue Toothpaste, available at InfoWarsTore.com!
[03:47:05.766 --> 03:47:08.387]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:25.208 --> 03:47:30.249]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[03:47:30.769 --> 03:47:33.510]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:38.391 --> 03:47:43.332]  And we are live.
[03:47:43.552 --> 03:47:46.033]  It is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:46.053 --> 03:47:49.734]  We're still talking about the fallout from this horrific Texas church massacre.
[03:47:50.402 --> 03:48:02.610]  Now of course it came out today that the shooter was going around inside the church shooting children and babies who were crying as this whole thing unfolded.
[03:48:03.408 --> 03:48:04.889]  Absolutely chilling.
[03:48:04.929 --> 03:48:12.533]  Of course, we know the stories of the parents and mothers who tried in vain to shield their own children from the bullets.
[03:48:12.973 --> 03:48:20.657]  Now, even more horrific details are coming out about this, which is why we need to try harder than ever to get to the root of the motivation.
[03:48:21.098 --> 03:48:23.299]  We've been told it was a domestic dispute.
[03:48:23.319 --> 03:48:25.100]  There's not really been any other information.
[03:48:25.874 --> 03:48:35.500]  A report from CNN says that Kelly, the shooter, had sent threatening text messages to his mother-in-law, who occasionally attended the Sutherland Springs Church.
[03:48:35.520 --> 03:48:39.182]  Of course, she didn't attend on the day he carried out the massacre.
[03:48:39.662 --> 03:48:49.368]  His grandmother-in-law was among those killed, but it appears that she was the only relation to the shooter who was actually in the church at the time of the massacre.
[03:48:50.114 --> 03:49:00.065]  Now it turns out that he, after beating up his ex-wife and child, had escaped from a mental hospital in 2012, but of course I come back again.
[03:49:01.010 --> 03:49:03.131]  To these anti-Christian Facebook posts.
[03:49:03.191 --> 03:49:16.416]  They had a number of his friends, and I talked to one of them, who basically said that he hated Christians, he was a militant atheist, back at school he was an emo kid, and no, that doesn't mean that all emo kids are going to be mass shooters.
[03:49:16.857 --> 03:49:19.238]  We all went through those kind of periods at school.
[03:49:19.278 --> 03:49:20.438]  I mean, I was a grunge kid.
[03:49:20.578 --> 03:49:27.161]  Everybody kind of went through a period where they were, you know, part of not, maybe not part of the in crowd, part of the fringe crowd.
[03:49:27.808 --> 03:49:29.411]  Difference is, you get over that, okay?
[03:49:29.451 --> 03:49:30.093]  You mature.
[03:49:30.493 --> 03:49:32.417]  This is what I posted on Twitter earlier today.
[03:49:32.958 --> 03:49:35.443]  I think a big thing with these mass shooters is...
[03:49:36.115 --> 03:49:43.761]  We have a serious problem in society of young people in this atomized society where people have less connection with each other.
[03:49:44.221 --> 03:49:51.627]  This narcissistic culture that encourages young men to be adolescents well into their late 20s and 30s.
[03:49:52.067 --> 03:49:55.610]  So they walk around with this aggrieved attitude that they're the victim.
[03:49:55.970 --> 03:50:00.374]  And yeah, that's fine when you're age 13 to 18, when you're an emo kid.
[03:50:00.854 --> 03:50:04.317]  You know, a lot of people go through that stage, but they're carrying it on.
[03:50:05.229 --> 03:50:06.730]  Social media helps them do this.
[03:50:06.750 --> 03:50:08.892]  This narcissistic culture helps them do this.
[03:50:09.252 --> 03:50:16.457]  This idea that you can attain fame by carrying out an atrocity, which the media plays into, contributes to this.
[03:50:17.138 --> 03:50:25.063]  Again, most of these mass shooters, it turns out, they're man babies who never get past this teenage emo grunge goth stage.
[03:50:25.524 --> 03:50:27.065]  They have arrested development.
[03:50:27.385 --> 03:50:28.706]  They turn to nihilism.
[03:50:28.966 --> 03:50:30.087]  They turn to despair.
[03:50:31.095 --> 03:50:37.364]  And again, they carry out atrocities to gain instant, even if it's posthumous, but instant fame.
[03:50:37.404 --> 03:50:41.409]  Let's go to the video, what they're not telling you about the Texas church massacre.
[03:50:41.449 --> 03:50:41.790]  Here it is.
[03:50:42.623 --> 03:50:49.088]  At least 26 people were killed and 20 wounded when a gunman opened fire inside a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas.
[03:50:49.148 --> 03:51:01.857]  And of course, both left and right immediately began blaming the massacre on their own respective enemies by conflating it with all white people, all left-wingers, all right-wingers, all atheists, whoever they hate the most.
[03:51:01.997 --> 03:51:02.737]  Now, hands up.
[03:51:03.038 --> 03:51:05.479]  I've been at fault for that in the past, too.
[03:51:05.539 --> 03:51:06.280]  But let's be honest.
[03:51:06.420 --> 03:51:10.143]  It's not only callous, it's just incredibly tedious at this point.
[03:51:10.183 --> 03:51:17.048]  But by the same token, the need to understand the motives and factors behind the attack serves two purposes.
[03:51:17.228 --> 03:51:20.430]  One, it gives us some clues to try to prevent it from happening again.
[03:51:20.550 --> 03:51:25.634]  And two, it at least offers some explanation, however twisted, of why it happened.
[03:51:25.694 --> 03:51:32.019]  Which is also a psychological coping mechanism that humans crave after every senseless incident like this.
[03:51:32.239 --> 03:51:34.680]  So what do we know about the motive at this point?
[03:51:34.740 --> 03:51:40.684]  The gunman was a committed atheist who bothered his friends on Facebook by incessantly calling Christians stupid.
[03:51:40.744 --> 03:51:43.845]  And that doesn't mean all atheists bear responsibility.
[03:51:43.905 --> 03:51:50.889]  Just as the blame for Dylann Roof's massacre shouldn't have been put on all white people or all Christians, as many did.
[03:51:50.969 --> 03:51:54.331]  But what it does mean is that this could have been an anti-Christian hate crime.
[03:51:54.431 --> 03:52:03.074]  Imagine this, an Islamophobe relentlessly posts on Facebook about how stupid Muslims are, then goes and shoots up a mosque massacring 26 Muslims.
[03:52:03.114 --> 03:52:06.016]  Would the media say his motive was a mystery?
[03:52:06.416 --> 03:52:06.656]  No!
[03:52:06.896 --> 03:52:11.778]  If it was just a personal dispute, why try to slaughter everyone in the church?
[03:52:11.858 --> 03:52:19.961]  Now, it may come out that there was a personal motive, but if they come out and claim it had nothing to do with his hatred of Christians, it's gonna look very odd.
[03:52:20.041 --> 03:52:24.343]  What role, if any, did mind-altering SSRI drugs play in this massacre?
[03:52:24.383 --> 03:52:30.766]  Medication that creates a disassociative mood that puts people in an emotionally dead trance-like state.
[03:52:30.886 --> 03:52:36.029]  Remember, the significant majority of mass shooters in the US have been on SSRI drugs.
[03:52:36.069 --> 03:52:48.736]  But the media never wants to talk about it because pharmaceutical giants who produce drugs like Zoloft, Prozac and Paxil spend around 2.4 billion dollars on direct-to-consumer television advertising every single year.
[03:52:48.796 --> 03:52:51.117]  The reaction to the shooting from the alt-left
[03:52:51.297 --> 03:52:53.580]  Was, of course, completely predictable.
[03:52:53.640 --> 03:52:59.688]  They labeled the NRA a terrorist group, despite no mass shooting having ever been carried out by an NRA member.
[03:52:59.768 --> 03:53:06.277]  They blamed the Second Amendment and gun owners, despite the fact that it was a responsible, armed citizen who stopped the attack.
[03:53:06.437 --> 03:53:12.439]  They blamed all white people, despite the fact that white people are actually underrepresented in mass shootings.
[03:53:12.499 --> 03:53:17.060]  They were also angry at me because Google linked to some of my tweets.
[03:53:17.220 --> 03:53:23.641]  Right, so 26 people have just been slaughtered and your first concern is who's getting the most traffic to their tweets.
[03:53:23.782 --> 03:53:29.003]  And speaking of tweets, some of them were almost as soul-crushingly depraved as the attack itself.
[03:53:29.123 --> 03:53:30.503]  The murdered victims were in a church.
[03:53:30.583 --> 03:53:33.164]  If Prez did anything, they'd be alive, you worthless sack of sh**!
[03:53:33.524 --> 03:53:39.506]  Right, so your gut reaction to 26 Christians being massacred is to insult Christians and Christianity.
[03:53:39.867 --> 03:53:40.827]  That's horrible!
[03:53:40.927 --> 03:53:42.448]  Sutherland Springs is in rural Texas.
[03:53:42.468 --> 03:53:44.188]  These were all likely 45 voters.
[03:53:44.288 --> 03:53:45.969]  This is karma in action, good riddance!
[03:53:46.189 --> 03:53:47.690]  Oh, and the children who died?
[03:53:47.710 --> 03:53:49.370]  You gotta crack eggs to make an omelette.
[03:53:49.430 --> 03:53:49.990]  No words.
[03:53:50.111 --> 03:53:51.231]  Just no words.
[03:53:51.531 --> 03:53:54.534]  Innocent people go to church on Sunday to honour their God, and while doing so, get shot and killed.
[03:53:54.594 --> 03:53:55.115]  What country?
[03:53:55.215 --> 03:53:55.655]  America.
[03:53:55.755 --> 03:53:55.976]  Why?
[03:53:56.176 --> 03:53:57.277]  Republicans!
[03:53:57.417 --> 03:54:01.541]  Statistically, 72% of the victims were Republicans.
[03:54:01.622 --> 03:54:02.462]  Probably more.
[03:54:02.522 --> 03:54:10.190]  So, hashtag not all Muslims are to blame for terror, but all Republicans are to blame for one guy shooting up a church full of mostly Republicans.
[03:54:10.290 --> 03:54:11.672]  James T. Hodgkinson?
[03:54:11.932 --> 03:54:12.653]  A Democrat?
[03:54:12.813 --> 03:54:16.194]  Just tried to massacre a bunch of Republicans five months ago.
[03:54:16.254 --> 03:54:21.015]  They were still removing the dead bodies from the church when she tweeted that.
[03:54:21.115 --> 03:54:22.235]  Let that sink in.
[03:54:22.375 --> 03:54:27.376]  First off, if your response to the slaughter of 26 white people is to get on Twitter and spew anti-white racism,
[03:54:34.158 --> 03:54:36.459]  Take a serious look in the friggin' mirror!
[03:54:36.540 --> 03:54:40.302]  And if he did it because he hated Christians, then it was terrorism!
[03:54:40.482 --> 03:54:41.783]  You relentless prick!
[03:54:41.863 --> 03:54:45.285]  Terrorism is based on motive, not skin colour!
[03:54:45.385 --> 03:54:47.146]  How many times do I have to say it?
[03:54:47.246 --> 03:54:51.729]  Let's be honest here, the West in general has a massive problem with Islamic terrorism.
[03:54:51.849 --> 03:54:55.111]  America has a massive problem with mass shootings.
[03:54:55.211 --> 03:54:59.494]  And people downplay or exaggerate one or the other based on their politics.
[03:54:59.614 --> 03:55:02.997]  Why can't we just acknowledge that both are a huge problem?
[03:55:03.017 --> 03:55:13.704]  And whereas with Islamic terrorists, the attackers are motivated by the promise of a glorious afterlife, domestic mass shooters seem to be motivated by the belief that there is no afterlife.
[03:55:13.765 --> 03:55:22.411]  They're bathed in a culture that exalts narcissism and the idea that anyone can achieve instant fame, and that fame is all that matters.
[03:55:22.551 --> 03:55:26.934]  Not through talent or hard work, but by generating mindless controversy.
[03:55:26.974 --> 03:55:31.897]  The ultimate extreme example of which is by carrying out an atrocity.
[03:55:31.957 --> 03:55:38.321]  And the media instantly provides these losers with the posthumous celebrity that they craved their entire life.
[03:55:38.441 --> 03:55:49.349]  We've had 20 years of mass murders, throughout which I have repeatedly told CNN and our other media, if you don't want to propagate more mass murders,
[03:55:50.249 --> 03:55:52.950]  Don't start the story with sirens blaring.
[03:55:53.190 --> 03:55:57.010]  The school day had only just begun when the attacker struck.
[03:55:57.430 --> 03:55:59.311]  Don't have photographs of the killer.
[03:56:00.011 --> 03:56:03.432]  The 17-year-old's three-hour rampage ended in his own death.
[03:56:03.652 --> 03:56:05.892]  Don't make this 24-7 coverage.
[03:56:06.092 --> 03:56:09.173]  The German Chancellor is about to give her reaction.
[03:56:09.193 --> 03:56:10.513]  We'll bring that to you live.
[03:56:10.553 --> 03:56:16.274]  Do everything you can not to make the body count the lead story.
[03:56:17.438 --> 03:56:20.319]  Carnage in the classroom, 16 people are dead.
[03:56:20.459 --> 03:56:24.019]  Not to make the killer some kind of anti-hero.
[03:56:24.439 --> 03:56:28.160]  Dressed in black combat gear, the gunman opened fire at random.
[03:56:28.220 --> 03:56:34.862]  Do localize this story to the affected community and make it as boring as possible in every other market.
[03:56:35.362 --> 03:56:42.263]  Because every time we have intense saturation coverage of a mass murder, we expect to see one or two more within a week.
[03:56:42.563 --> 03:56:48.407]  But how can we stop turning mass shooters into macabre celebrities without limiting press freedom?
[03:56:48.687 --> 03:56:50.168]  It's virtually impossible.
[03:56:50.309 --> 03:57:04.278]  As opposed to Islamic terrorists, whose entire existence is enriched with meaning, however barbaric it seems to us, the domestic mass shooters radicalization process seems to stem from a vacuum of meaning and purpose in life.
[03:57:04.419 --> 03:57:07.901]  A vacuum that's easily filled by despair and nihilism.
[03:57:07.981 --> 03:57:13.726]  I think we need to dig deeper and realize that these kids come from a culture that's lost faith in itself.
[03:57:13.966 --> 03:57:20.872]  Society is becoming more and more atomized, and that lack of empathy and cohesion is sure to produce one thing.
[03:57:20.992 --> 03:57:26.657]  Lonely, isolated, alienated monsters who lash out with brutal, bloody resentment.
[03:57:26.838 --> 03:57:29.340]  Please celebrate the lives of the victims.
[03:57:29.720 --> 03:57:31.382]  Please celebrate the heroes.
[03:57:31.542 --> 03:57:34.164]  The mother who died while protecting her young children.
[03:57:34.224 --> 03:57:43.064]  The residents who chased the gunman away, preventing an even higher death toll, please donate to the Sutherland Springs Church via the link in the description.
[03:57:52.239 --> 03:57:59.144]  Every morning before I start writing or shooting a video, I take two capsules of Brain Force for a sustainable burst of energy.

[03:58:28.506 --> 03:58:31.289]  Telomeres is something you may have heard of recently.
[03:58:31.309 --> 03:58:36.816]  It is what is at the end of your DNA that is responsible for the aging process.
[03:58:37.176 --> 03:58:39.797]  This is a very important part of our human chemistry.
[03:58:40.037 --> 03:58:46.621]  So you already know that we live in an environment that is just loaded with toxic chemicals.
[03:58:47.061 --> 03:58:55.525]  Now they're finding that that environment is actually affecting babies in the prenatal stage, specifically when it comes to the telomeres.
