[00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:03.530]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.212]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:11.673 --> 00:00:20.516]  I gotta tell you, having Megyn Kelly here yesterday until like 1045 at night was a soul-sucking experience.
[00:00:22.557 --> 00:00:28.039]  I tell ya, I'd take my licks to get the word out, but man, dealing with
[00:00:29.713 --> 00:00:38.539]  Lawyers that make being sociopaths an art form really lets you know why society's in so much trouble.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:55.030]  Later in the broadcast, I think I'm going to talk a little bit about her visit and this report that's supposedly going to air in the next few weeks, this profile that's really an investigative report masquerading as a profile.
[00:00:56.482 --> 00:00:59.404]  Really fake news, in my view, will be airing.
[00:00:59.904 --> 00:01:02.046]  You know, nice people, nice producer.
[00:01:02.086 --> 00:01:07.309]  I felt like the lady that's the lead producer, nice Southern Bell lady, older lady.
[00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.514]  It's like somebody that leads you to the gas chamber, or to the hangman's noose, or to the electric chair.
[00:01:16.415 --> 00:01:19.057]  They comfort you, give you your last meal.
[00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:26.645]  They tell you that heaven is on the other side of the electrical volts that will be pouring through your brain.
[00:01:29.387 --> 00:01:30.388]  But I know that.
[00:01:31.148 --> 00:01:32.670]  I know MSM is discredited.
[00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.211]  I know it's rigged.
[00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:37.214]  So occasionally I go into the lion's den
[00:01:39.753 --> 00:01:51.804]  So that we can just illustrate exactly what we're looking at, and the arrogance of the power structure that put out the fake polls for Hillary, that tried to steal the election, that's done all these other things, that thought that we would accept having Al Qaeda and ISIS brought into our country.
[00:01:52.164 --> 00:01:54.546]  The arrogance of MSM will be its undoing.
[00:01:54.566 --> 00:02:00.011]  I mean, imagine, they were here from 9.30 in the morning until 10.45 at night.
[00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:01.992]  That's when we stopped doing interviews.
[00:02:02.052 --> 00:02:02.453]  I said, sure.
[00:02:07.631 --> 00:02:12.512]  So they can edit it down to 11 minutes and make me look as bad as possible.
[00:02:14.253 --> 00:02:25.136]  But think about how far we've come together that they've got to do stuff like this and attack us on every news channel, every platform there is constantly, because they're scared of what we're covering.
[00:02:25.156 --> 00:02:26.517]  They're scared of what we're doing.
[00:02:27.177 --> 00:02:30.718]  They're scared of nationalism rising and that America is back.
[00:02:33.226 --> 00:02:37.007]  In fact, Eric Trump said last night on Hannity, quote, America is back.
[00:02:37.627 --> 00:02:39.027]  And that's why the globalists are panicking.
[00:02:41.028 --> 00:02:45.589]  We also have a woman confronting Chelsea Clinton, who is now the spitting image of Webster Hubble.
[00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:46.369]  No doubt.
[00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:52.811]  In fact, Dahl offered Chelsea Clinton a million dollars for the charity of her choice.
[00:02:53.834 --> 00:02:56.838]  Where she's looted billions out of Haiti and other places, so she doesn't care.
[00:02:57.378 --> 00:03:05.268]  A million dollars, the charity of her choice, to have a third-party group do a maternity or paternity test on her, and you know she's Webster Hubble.
[00:03:05.588 --> 00:03:07.871]  I mean, you look at this new video we're gonna play when we come back.
[00:03:08.551 --> 00:03:09.933]  It is Webster Hubble.
[00:03:10.794 --> 00:03:14.435]  But she looks like Webster Hubble with her hair pulled back in this video.
[00:03:14.815 --> 00:03:16.275]  I mean, it's Webster Hubble.
[00:03:17.055 --> 00:03:19.356]  Those are some strong genes.
[00:03:20.196 --> 00:03:24.337]  I mean, that is daddy little girl right there.
[00:03:25.537 --> 00:03:26.837]  Daddy, daddy girl.
[00:03:27.597 --> 00:03:28.997]  That ain't Bill Clinton girl.
[00:03:29.057 --> 00:03:30.518]  That daddy girl right there.
[00:03:33.098 --> 00:03:36.699]  I mean, I've never seen somebody with such a spitting image of their daddy.
[00:03:37.756 --> 00:03:43.022]  One of my daughters looks about 90% like me, but she's killing that spitting image of that daddy.
[00:03:45.605 --> 00:03:46.386]  So that's coming up.
[00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:55.276]  Eric Trump spoke the truth as well when he said they would rather see him fail than have America succeed.
[00:03:55.296 --> 00:03:56.778]  And that's exactly what it's all about.
[00:03:57.058 --> 00:03:58.460]  But I'll take it further, Mr. Trump.
[00:03:59.833 --> 00:04:04.097]  They want America to fail, that's why they hate Trump, because he wants Trump to succeed.
[00:04:04.398 --> 00:04:05.639]  Don't put the cart before the horse.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.623]  The globalists want America and any free market, free system to fail.
[00:04:09.843 --> 00:04:13.968]  They admit that, because they have a centralized system that's in competition with free market.
[00:04:14.488 --> 00:04:15.529]  They have a monopoly system.
[00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:22.897]  And so, they are desperately wanting us to fail, so that's why they want Trump to fail.
[00:04:23.982 --> 00:04:26.504]  Not, they want Trump to fail, so they want America to fail.
[00:04:27.025 --> 00:04:40.255]  Globalism is always about making America, any other powerful, upwardly mobile, dynamic, free society, from succeeding because that challenges the kingmakers that want centralized control.
[00:04:40.275 --> 00:04:43.978]  I'm Alex Jones, and this is the InfoWar.
[00:04:44.458 --> 00:04:52.205]  Committed 110% unto death in taking down the New World Order, restoring the Republic, and empowering the human species.
[00:04:54.986 --> 00:05:01.851]  Every morning before I start writing or shooting a video, I take two capsules of Brain Force for a sustainable burst of energy.
[00:05:02.151 --> 00:05:06.374]  This is, without question, the most powerful nootropic I've ever taken.
[00:05:06.754 --> 00:05:11.858]  And it comes without any of the crashes or the jitters associated with energy drinks.
[00:05:11.918 --> 00:05:14.920]  It's additive-free, nothing artificial.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.381]  It's Brain Force Plus.
[00:05:16.801 --> 00:05:24.046]  Read thousands of five-star independent reviews right now and get your Brain Force Plus at InfoWarsLife.
[00:05:25.226 --> 00:05:28.748]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[00:05:29.208 --> 00:05:35.251]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[00:05:35.671 --> 00:05:38.452]  It is the new t-shirt from InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:05:38.833 --> 00:05:41.854]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:05:42.054 --> 00:05:45.496]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[00:05:45.836 --> 00:05:46.276]  The left
[00:05:47.436 --> 00:05:57.260]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.721]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:04.063]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[00:06:04.103 --> 00:06:12.186]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate the image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:06:12.446 --> 00:06:15.127]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter,
[00:06:15.507 --> 00:06:18.689]  It will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:20.449]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[00:06:20.609 --> 00:06:21.790]  It's available right now.
[00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.651]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.

[00:07:01.112 --> 00:07:05.294]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:07:05.554 --> 00:07:07.475]  And this part is most important.
[00:07:07.615 --> 00:07:14.038]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:07:14.418 --> 00:07:15.498]  That means it's clean.
[00:07:15.858 --> 00:07:16.879]  That means it's pure.
[00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:19.820]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.481]  That's InfoWarsLives.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[00:07:37.316 --> 00:07:38.398]  This is the Info War.
[00:07:54.995 --> 00:07:56.036]  We've got it.
[00:07:56.056 --> 00:08:02.520]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.681]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:06.962 --> 00:08:12.606]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:38.852]  Well, the president's son, Eric, has made a mistake.
[00:08:39.753 --> 00:08:40.293]  Eric Trump.
[00:08:42.234 --> 00:08:43.474]  He went on Hannity last night.
[00:08:43.634 --> 00:08:45.035]  We're going to play the clip here in a moment.
[00:08:46.896 --> 00:08:47.456]  And he said,
[00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:52.287]  They would rather see him fail than have America succeed.
[00:08:53.508 --> 00:08:57.571]  Eric, you're 95% over the target.
[00:09:00.454 --> 00:09:08.019]  But the key twist here is the globalists admit they want America and free market, open societies, where there's real competition.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.121]  They want that to fail.
[00:09:10.521 --> 00:09:14.624]  And that's what the UN and the globalists and the Davos Group and all of them admit.
[00:09:14.964 --> 00:09:16.225]  They want monopoly.
[00:09:16.986 --> 00:09:17.967]  They want control.
[00:09:19.522 --> 00:09:22.065]  John D. Rockefeller I said, competition is a sin.
[00:09:22.386 --> 00:09:23.387]  And I know you know that.
[00:09:23.447 --> 00:09:34.941]  I know your father and his father, your grandfather, battled through all that and defeated some of the robber barons and folks that tried to shut you out of being able to operate and do business in New York.
[00:09:36.744 --> 00:09:38.266]  And I understand you know that as well.
[00:09:39.514 --> 00:09:45.417]  They're not ready to go all the way out and point out this is by design meant to shut things down.
[00:09:45.918 --> 00:09:55.443]  But your father is, and that's why his speech last week, that 35 minute speech, pulling out of the Paris Climate Carbon Tax Accord, was so important.
[00:09:57.304 --> 00:09:58.725]  Because it laid it all out.
[00:09:59.125 --> 00:10:00.706]  And that was all fact.
[00:10:02.367 --> 00:10:06.029]  That Europe and the United States and Australia have to make the carbon cuts.
[00:10:07.365 --> 00:10:15.229]  Massively increase our power prices and shut down our industry and make it prohibitive to do manufacturing here.
[00:10:15.849 --> 00:10:25.054]  And then India and China and Mexico and 160 plus other countries make zero cuts and they can run dirty plants on top of it.
[00:10:28.636 --> 00:10:29.376]  And finally,
[00:10:31.348 --> 00:10:35.689]  It wasn't some esoteric Senate or House hearing where this was being testified to.
[00:10:35.769 --> 00:10:37.350]  It's all there, cut and dry.
[00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:39.190]  It's outrageous!
[00:10:40.731 --> 00:10:43.031]  So it's not that they just want your father to fail.
[00:10:44.212 --> 00:10:47.293]  They want your father to fail because they want America to fail.
[00:10:48.113 --> 00:10:50.093]  That's what globalism is, inherently.
[00:10:52.514 --> 00:10:58.716]  He goes on to say, they would rather see him fail than have America succeed, but that America is back.
[00:11:00.267 --> 00:11:01.099]  That's what I've been telling you.
[00:11:02.056 --> 00:11:05.918]  For the last six months, America is back fighting for its life.
[00:11:06.298 --> 00:11:07.379]  Back from the dead.
[00:11:08.059 --> 00:11:09.800]  Back from total globalist control.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.161]  And now we've got a beachhead in Washington.
[00:11:12.501 --> 00:11:14.723]  Trump is absolutely real.
[00:11:15.723 --> 00:11:16.864]  Absolutely independent.
[00:11:17.464 --> 00:11:18.564]  Does that mean he's perfect?
[00:11:18.604 --> 00:11:19.865]  Does that mean he has all the answers?
[00:11:20.105 --> 00:11:21.526]  Does that mean he isn't wrong on things?
[00:11:21.626 --> 00:11:21.826]  No.
[00:11:22.086 --> 00:11:26.048]  Does that mean he doesn't have distorted views compared to some of our visions?
[00:11:26.929 --> 00:11:27.529]  Absolutely!
[00:11:27.609 --> 00:11:29.210]  But he is his own man.
[00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:30.951]  He is not for austerity.
[00:11:32.998 --> 00:11:34.679]  He does not want to screw you over.
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:43.421]  And that's why the globalists absolutely want to destroy him.
[00:11:44.262 --> 00:11:45.502]  They want to conquer.
[00:11:46.062 --> 00:11:47.243]  They want to dominate.
[00:11:48.003 --> 00:11:49.844]  They want to shut down the new independent media.
[00:11:50.744 --> 00:11:52.685]  They want to take over the churches even further.
[00:11:53.065 --> 00:11:56.326]  They want to tell your children what their sexual preference is going to be.
[00:11:56.606 --> 00:11:59.887]  They want to run your life and turn you into a total slave.
[00:12:01.155 --> 00:12:06.497]  They've tried to get you to sell out your future to Hollywood and the trendy culture of empty narcissism.
[00:12:07.777 --> 00:12:10.118]  But they know many of you don't want that poison cup.
[00:12:10.738 --> 00:12:17.400]  So they want to shut off your resources until you have no hope and engineer you and your family and destroy your children.
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.421]  And when I say this, I mean it from the bottom of my heart.
[00:12:20.761 --> 00:12:23.642]  And the evidence is so overwhelming, it is unbelievable.
[00:12:25.322 --> 00:12:30.004]  MSM is filled with a bunch of anti-human mercenary scum.
[00:12:32.108 --> 00:12:39.433]  Heartless, sociopathic trash that only seek raw power and control and who want to see you fail.
[00:12:40.174 --> 00:12:43.436]  And they are dedicated to covering up the vaccines, killing millions.
[00:12:43.756 --> 00:12:47.899]  They are dedicated to covering up the GMO designed to destroy your fertility.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.382]  They are dedicated to annihilating basic human freedom.
[00:12:54.724 --> 00:13:16.439]  They are pure evil, and they work for the most sinister forces this planet's ever seen, and they are the most cold-blooded, over-the-top, arrogant scum that think that they can just openly engage in all this criminal activity in front of everyone, and openly set up private corporate world governments that will run every facet of your life, and that you and I and all of us will just accept it.
[00:13:17.279 --> 00:13:18.020]  But here's the problem.
[00:13:20.242 --> 00:13:26.204]  They know they're beginning to fail, and they know their grip on humanity's psyche and soul and will is slipping.
[00:13:27.584 --> 00:13:29.044]  The WikiLeaks are so powerful.
[00:13:29.825 --> 00:13:32.865]  As top Democrats and others say, we're losing our grip on them.
[00:13:33.226 --> 00:13:34.106]  They're getting hope.
[00:13:35.466 --> 00:13:38.347]  We've got to keep them in the dark, desperate, with no information.
[00:13:38.467 --> 00:13:39.967]  I mean, this is so evil.
[00:13:40.287 --> 00:13:44.148]  It sounds like psychopaths talking about, you know, women or children they've got in cages.
[00:13:44.869 --> 00:13:45.929]  Because that's who these people are.
[00:13:49.324 --> 00:13:51.245]  Lusting after dominating innocence.
[00:13:51.866 --> 00:13:53.047]  Destroying vision.
[00:13:53.307 --> 00:13:54.348]  Destroying goodness.
[00:13:58.871 --> 00:14:06.176]  They want an unaware and compliant citizenry of minions.
[00:14:06.357 --> 00:14:09.799]  But now they don't need us with the robots and all the rest of it coming online.
[00:14:12.081 --> 00:14:14.983]  And so the soft kill, the ambient
[00:14:18.752 --> 00:14:33.060]  The program of covert death is expanding, and the ambient hum in the background is becoming a scream, like being in the middle of a tornado.
[00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:47.329]  And the world is waking up, and as the enemy builds the nightmare system they've been planning, struggling humanity begins to find its footing, and the evil ones panic.
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:50.900]  But they will never succeed in the end.
[00:14:51.841 --> 00:15:05.664]  And see, these psychopaths, these sociopaths, these mercenaries, these control freaks, these greedy people that run the spectrum, they don't understand people that at a spiritual level want to defeat them.
[00:15:05.724 --> 00:15:09.625]  Just like they want to enslave us, just like they want to hurt innocents, we want to defend innocents.
[00:15:10.666 --> 00:15:13.806]  Just like they have no shame and no conscience, we have shame.
[00:15:14.026 --> 00:15:14.767]  We have a conscience.
[00:15:14.947 --> 00:15:15.747]  But we also have
[00:15:16.994 --> 00:15:25.017]  The great exaltations to do good because we understand the paradigm between our greater angels and our fallen self and we want to be with God.
[00:15:26.078 --> 00:15:28.639]  And so we're drawn towards fighting them.
[00:15:28.879 --> 00:15:38.102]  We're drawn towards standing against them and they look at us and threaten us and attack us and persecute us and try to destroy us and they don't understand why we don't care.
[00:15:40.683 --> 00:15:44.385]  Even though it's painful to the flesh, it's exhilarating to the spirit,
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:16:02.364]  Because we know what we're doing is right, and it's what got humanity this far through all the travails and all the crises and all of the adventures and all of the great struggles of our species and our great history.
[00:16:03.784 --> 00:16:08.706]  When we do the right thing, we join our ancestors in the great quest and God's great plan.
[00:16:10.146 --> 00:16:12.067]  The New World Order will fail.
[00:16:13.047 --> 00:16:13.908]  It will fall.
[00:16:15.408 --> 00:16:18.249]  All of these arrogant sellouts that serve the globalist program
[00:16:19.531 --> 00:16:22.474]  Will be punished in this life.
[00:16:25.617 --> 00:16:27.799]  They all lie to themselves and think they're part of the power elite.
[00:16:30.121 --> 00:16:38.068]  I told Megyn Kelly last night while she was kind of snickering about world government and forced population control, I said pediatric cancers are up over 10,000 percent.
[00:16:38.828 --> 00:16:41.791]  50 years ago, a doctor would fly across the country to see a child with cancer.
[00:16:42.051 --> 00:16:44.493]  Now you go to the mall, to your left, to your right.
[00:16:45.469 --> 00:16:50.472]  The kids have got their shaved heads, they've got their brain surgery marks all over them.
[00:16:51.432 --> 00:17:02.458]  I mean, I was in one restaurant and there was like four kids, you could tell it was brain surgery, stumbling around with their motor functions hacked in half for whatever hellish testing they'd gone through, poor little babies.
[00:17:03.598 --> 00:17:07.881]  And I said, surely, surely by the time you're an old woman, most of your family will be dead from cancer.
[00:17:08.601 --> 00:17:10.382]  And I said, your children are going to die of cancer.
[00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:14.360]  And the people around were like, whoa.
[00:17:15.361 --> 00:17:18.342]  Her crew, she had a big, they're like, whoa, can we spend that?
[00:17:19.162 --> 00:17:20.343]  Like he's hoping they die of cancer?
[00:17:20.363 --> 00:17:22.044]  And I said, I'm not hoping they die of cancer.
[00:17:22.624 --> 00:17:24.425]  But I said, surely no.
[00:17:26.165 --> 00:17:28.687]  That if it's 10,000 plus percent now, that's an old number.
[00:17:30.647 --> 00:17:35.190]  It's going to be 20, 30,000, 40,000 percent, just the next few decades, it's estimated.
[00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:38.171]  And it's going to kill your children, Megan.
[00:17:38.491 --> 00:17:40.472]  You're going to outlive your children, Megan.
[00:17:41.664 --> 00:17:44.747]  And I've got children on this planet, too, as well, and I want to reverse this.
[00:17:45.067 --> 00:17:47.769]  So you think about working for those psychopaths.
[00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:49.310]  Go ahead and show some pictures of her.
[00:17:50.151 --> 00:17:52.853]  You think about working for the New World Order long and hard.
[00:17:53.133 --> 00:17:56.096]  Everybody at Media Matters and all the rest of it, you think about that.
[00:17:56.116 --> 00:17:59.759]  Because you can have that painted-on Joker smile all you want.
[00:17:59.779 --> 00:18:02.701]  And those lawyer sociopath eyes.
[00:18:03.942 --> 00:18:06.344]  But at the end of the day, I've spoken the truth.
[00:18:07.571 --> 00:18:08.751]  And I've warned you.
[00:18:08.771 --> 00:18:11.112]  And I've laid out the facts.
[00:18:12.793 --> 00:18:14.534]  Because I have basic humanity.
[00:18:14.854 --> 00:18:19.476]  And I know that's not the trendy mainline culture that's pushed.
[00:18:19.576 --> 00:18:24.578]  And I'm not even singling Megyn Kelly out and saying she's the end-all be-all of evil.
[00:18:26.739 --> 00:18:27.699]  But not feminine.
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:29.380]  Cold.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.121]  Robotic.
[00:18:32.521 --> 00:18:32.861]  Dead.
[00:18:33.682 --> 00:18:36.683]  I felt zero attraction to Megyn Kelly.
[00:18:38.769 --> 00:18:40.130]  That's not an insult to Megyn Kelly.
[00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:41.451]  I talked to a lot of other folks that know her.
[00:18:41.471 --> 00:18:42.351]  They said, no, it's the same.
[00:18:42.891 --> 00:18:48.335]  Because you're dealing with... A sociopath?
[00:18:48.355 --> 00:18:50.856]  A psychopath?
[00:18:54.118 --> 00:18:54.418]  I don't know.
[00:18:55.419 --> 00:18:57.900]  But I wanted to see it for myself.
[00:19:00.962 --> 00:19:01.882]  The girl next door.
[00:19:05.004 --> 00:19:06.125]  Sitting there with the toad creature.
[00:19:12.168 --> 00:19:15.210]  And again, she can come off like the sweetest, nicest person.
[00:19:16.491 --> 00:19:24.217]  She told me point blank in a long phone conversation that she wasn't going to get into the things and wasn't going to focus on the things that I knew she was coming for.
[00:19:24.797 --> 00:19:29.381]  And then for 90 minutes, that was the last interview of three yesterday.
[00:19:30.726 --> 00:19:33.328]  She did everything she said she wouldn't in spades.
[00:19:33.528 --> 00:19:37.010]  And I knew that from before she ever came.
[00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:39.851]  But I wanted to see it for myself.
[00:19:40.932 --> 00:19:43.994]  And so that we could all see it for ourselves as well.
[00:19:44.974 --> 00:19:53.079]  And experience what it is to serve the force that's strangling this country.
[00:19:55.588 --> 00:20:07.279]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:20:07.839 --> 00:20:09.921]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:20:10.121 --> 00:20:12.944]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:20:13.385 --> 00:20:14.686]  It's made in the USA.
[00:20:15.326 --> 00:20:15.447]  It's
[00:20:15.987 --> 00:20:16.327]  I think?
[00:20:38.712 --> 00:20:38.772]  Yes.
[00:21:00.785 --> 00:21:01.425]  When it comes to
[00:21:20.453 --> 00:21:30.277]  You owe it to your family and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[00:21:30.357 --> 00:21:38.620]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:45.503]  Because if you're sick, if you're over there on the sidelines and not in the fight, you're basically giving in to the New World Order.
[00:21:46.545 --> 00:21:50.330]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:52.112]  Now it's time to change our bodies.
[00:21:52.753 --> 00:21:54.855]  With Z-Shield and InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:22:00.194 --> 00:22:05.761]  Does your shampoo leave your scalp itchy and your hair dry and frizzy?

[00:22:33.031 --> 00:22:38.876]  Antiseptic herbs that have demonstrated antimicrobial activity are used.
[00:22:39.276 --> 00:22:40.617]  Go natural.
[00:22:41.057 --> 00:22:42.318]  Go organic.

[00:23:52.173 --> 00:24:00.740]  I'm offering a million dollars to Bill and Hillary Clinton's supposed daughter, Chelsea Hubble.
[00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:15.892]  Now we know Hillary is the mother.
[00:24:16.672 --> 00:24:25.359]  She was pregnant on record and had Chelsea, but it's well known that in the law firm her business partner was Webster Hubble and that that is the father.
[00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:38.710]  And we're going to show you video of her being confronted about her stepfather Bill Clinton being a rapist and with her hair pulled back and it is Webster Hubble to a tee.
[00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:41.011]  So one million dollar
[00:24:42.045 --> 00:24:42.365]  Prize.
[00:24:42.725 --> 00:24:45.007]  That's coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:45.027 --> 00:24:52.752]  Of course, she has to go do a paternity test at a major third-party site.
[00:24:53.313 --> 00:24:54.914]  Has to all be witnessed and videotaped.
[00:24:55.434 --> 00:24:56.074]  All's being done.
[00:24:56.775 --> 00:24:59.737]  And then we have to, you know, actually then publish those results.
[00:24:59.817 --> 00:25:01.078]  And we know it's Webster Hubble.
[00:25:02.279 --> 00:25:03.940]  We'll need a sample from Webster Hubble as well.
[00:25:05.186 --> 00:25:06.546]  And it's just insane.
[00:25:06.726 --> 00:25:08.087]  But the test is the face.
[00:25:08.527 --> 00:25:09.747]  That's not Bill Clinton's daughter.
[00:25:09.787 --> 00:25:11.968]  But I'm sorry, I'm already jumping the gun.
[00:25:11.988 --> 00:25:22.551]  So let's just go to that clip now, then I'll get into Eric Trump's powerful statements dealing with the fact that they're trying to destroy the country and want to destroy his father.
[00:25:23.601 --> 00:25:24.322]  In the process.
[00:25:24.662 --> 00:25:26.003]  But first, let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[00:25:26.303 --> 00:25:28.164]  Woman confronts Chelsea Clinton.
[00:25:28.885 --> 00:25:29.966]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[00:25:30.446 --> 00:25:30.786]  Rebel.
[00:25:31.127 --> 00:25:31.467]  Media.
[00:25:32.347 --> 00:25:41.895]  Watch what happens when Laura Loomer asks Chelsea Clinton to sign a copy of her book, She Persisted, for her friend Juanita Broderick.
[00:25:41.935 --> 00:25:43.736]  Here is Webster Hubble's daughter.
[00:25:44.392 --> 00:25:45.013]  Hi, Chelsea.
[00:25:45.293 --> 00:25:45.553]  Hi.
[00:25:45.613 --> 00:25:46.093]  How are you?
[00:25:46.233 --> 00:25:46.774]  Good, how are you?
[00:25:46.814 --> 00:25:47.054]  Good.
[00:25:47.114 --> 00:25:52.318]  Because this book's for everyone, including women who have wanted to speak up but have been told to quiet down.
[00:25:52.358 --> 00:25:54.360]  Can you sign it for my friend Juanita Broderick?
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:58.363]  Because she's been silenced by your parents, especially Bill Clinton, who's a rapist.
[00:25:58.663 --> 00:25:59.343]  Can you sign it for her?
[00:25:59.363 --> 00:26:00.204]  Thank you for coming today.
[00:26:00.304 --> 00:26:00.965]  Can you sign it?
[00:26:02.145 --> 00:26:02.346]  Thanks.
[00:26:05.248 --> 00:26:07.429]  And of course, that's a good question to ask.
[00:26:09.131 --> 00:26:11.833]  But I would also have asked the question, what about Haiti?
[00:26:13.422 --> 00:26:18.444]  You guys took 97% of the money and kept it for yourself, and even the WikiLeaks should tell your parents, man, this is wrong.
[00:26:18.904 --> 00:26:20.785]  These people are dying down there en masse.
[00:26:22.025 --> 00:26:22.826]  Why are we doing this?
[00:26:23.066 --> 00:26:25.287]  Because Mama and Daddy need some more money, sweetie.
[00:26:25.847 --> 00:26:37.732]  And they're liberals, so it's okay, but if you go to the actual video, the still they have, I guess it's a photo, before they get up and shoot the video, and it's just Webster Hubble's head.
[00:26:38.792 --> 00:26:41.193]  It's the still that's up on Infowars.com on the front page.
[00:26:42.523 --> 00:26:45.385]  Where it links through to the video and the article, and it's just incredible.
[00:26:45.405 --> 00:26:48.407]  But you look at her, it is Webster Hubble.
[00:26:49.688 --> 00:26:54.792]  An absolute spitting image, and it just shows how nothing we hear or see with the Clintons is real.
[00:26:58.935 --> 00:26:59.816]  It's total fraud.
[00:26:59.936 --> 00:27:00.816]  No, that's not the one.
[00:27:00.836 --> 00:27:01.797]  I saw it this morning.
[00:27:02.338 --> 00:27:05.320]  I think it's the still they use on the front page of Infowars.com.
[00:27:06.374 --> 00:27:08.557]  When you go to the sub page.
[00:27:09.158 --> 00:27:15.026]  So what you would do is you would back out of that and then you would see it there, but it's somewhere there on the site.
[00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:23.818]  Now when we come back, we're going to get into the big news and that's what
[00:27:25.051 --> 00:27:27.292]  Eric Trump's talking about and what the real score is.
[00:27:27.773 --> 00:27:29.194]  And then the even bigger news.
[00:27:29.974 --> 00:27:32.656]  Massive Ramadan attacks everywhere.
[00:27:33.336 --> 00:27:35.798]  Including the new thing, at least in Europe.
[00:27:35.978 --> 00:27:36.898]  It's not new in Israel.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:41.842]  But now in Greater Palestine, which is England and Germany and France.
[00:27:42.882 --> 00:27:45.404]  Areas stolen from the Palestinians, like London.
[00:27:47.365 --> 00:27:48.066]  Being sarcastic.
[00:27:48.706 --> 00:27:51.167]  Groups of women stabbing people lovingly.
[00:27:51.848 --> 00:27:53.369]  And saying, this is from Allah.
[00:27:56.607 --> 00:27:58.848]  So that's all coming up after we got a break.
[00:27:58.908 --> 00:28:00.428]  First off, we've got some good news.
[00:28:01.629 --> 00:28:03.329]  The information war is attempting to expand.
[00:28:03.349 --> 00:28:08.051]  We're trying to hire a lot of new people and put on a lot of new radio slash TV programs here in the next month or so.
[00:28:08.631 --> 00:28:10.091]  But we need your support to do that.
[00:28:10.352 --> 00:28:14.753]  And we make it easy with amazing products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:28:15.473 --> 00:28:16.674]  Go to InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:28:18.554 --> 00:28:20.215]  It's been sold out for months.
[00:28:20.775 --> 00:28:23.316]  And believe me, I'm trying to stop these supply chain problems.
[00:28:24.212 --> 00:28:30.798]  But we now have the Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste with Iodine and Colloidal Silver.
[00:28:30.818 --> 00:28:34.062]  30% off for $9.95.
[00:28:34.102 --> 00:28:35.283]  It's a big tube of paste.
[00:28:35.943 --> 00:28:37.164]  It's super high quality.
[00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:42.285]  It's made by the biggest manufacturer of organic fluoride-free toothpaste in the country.
[00:28:42.905 --> 00:28:47.871]  And they just private label it for us at their factory at the iodine and the colloidal silver.
[00:28:48.712 --> 00:28:50.914]  And it's $9.95 right now.
[00:28:51.455 --> 00:28:53.757]  And your purchase makes the broadcast possible.
[00:28:54.338 --> 00:28:58.182]  You can also get it with our new Organic Mouthwash that's a 10 to 1 concentrate.
[00:28:58.202 --> 00:29:02.987]  You just put like half a teaspoon of 6 ounces of water and it's still super ultra strong.
[00:29:03.027 --> 00:29:05.770]  It's essential oils, extremely concentrated.
[00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:07.772]  This is strong stuff.
[00:29:07.832 --> 00:29:10.014]  Emrix Essentials paired with Super Blue.
[00:29:11.001 --> 00:29:14.964]  And you get a big discount on the two together with a total oral care pack.
[00:29:15.365 --> 00:29:27.655]  We also have very inexpensive but high quality travel and regular toothbrushes impregnated with colloidal silver at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com or AAA253-3139.
[00:29:27.695 --> 00:29:29.417]  But Super Blue, back in stock.
[00:29:29.457 --> 00:29:33.780]  We were sold out of the children's bubblegum flavor that isn't as strong.
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:35.382]  It still has the iodine and colloidal silver.
[00:29:35.402 --> 00:29:37.303]  It just doesn't have the strong peppermint in it.
[00:29:38.424 --> 00:29:41.045]  That sold out, but Super Blue, our best seller, is back.
[00:29:41.405 --> 00:29:42.586]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:29:42.606 --> 00:29:44.046]  Selenium is also back.
[00:29:44.146 --> 00:29:45.007]  We're on the march.
[00:29:45.507 --> 00:29:47.107]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:48.048 --> 00:29:50.729]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:30:05.092]  You might think the best ways to stop terrorism is maybe extreme vetting, not allowing unvetted refugees into your home, maybe not trying to do so many regime changes in Middle Eastern countries.
[00:30:05.212 --> 00:30:06.414]  Well, you're all wrong.
[00:30:06.594 --> 00:30:11.901]  In fact, Hillary Clinton says a way to stop terrorism is to understand other cultures and their food.
[00:30:12.021 --> 00:30:12.462]  Yes, really.
[00:30:12.602 --> 00:30:23.152]  She also defended London Mayor Siti Khan, the man who once represented 9-11 Al-Qaeda member Zacharias Moussaoui, called moderate Muslims Uncle Toms, and said terrorism was part and parcel to living in a major city.
[00:30:23.332 --> 00:30:25.954]  And she added, Khan has shown steady, determined leadership.
[00:30:25.994 --> 00:30:28.697]  Hillary said the best way to combating terror is to reach out to the world.
[00:30:28.797 --> 00:30:30.838]  In order to understand people living in foreign countries.
[00:30:30.978 --> 00:30:31.859]  Getting to know one another.
[00:30:31.979 --> 00:30:35.741]  Learning about the experiences, the lives, the cultures, the religions, the food.
[00:30:35.781 --> 00:30:40.304]  So does this mean we gotta be like into stoning women, cutting off their genitals, and throwing gays off buildings?
[00:30:40.424 --> 00:30:45.307]  This is not a time to lash out, to incite fear, to use tragedy and terror for political gain, said Clinton.
[00:30:45.447 --> 00:30:53.052]  A comment obviously aimed at Donald Trump, and anyone else who has correctly identified political correctness and tolerance of Islam as creating a fertile ground for terrorist attacks in the Western world.
[00:30:53.192 --> 00:30:56.054]  Rob Dewey reporting for InfoWars Nightly News and InfoWars.com.
[00:30:57.369 --> 00:30:59.210]  I'm gonna lay it out short and sweet.
[00:31:00.872 --> 00:31:06.536]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[00:31:07.237 --> 00:31:11.140]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:14.322]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[00:31:14.402 --> 00:31:15.543]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[00:31:16.224 --> 00:31:18.786]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[00:31:19.767 --> 00:31:20.107]  Or more.
[00:31:20.207 --> 00:31:22.068]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[00:31:22.629 --> 00:31:24.090]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:27.553]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[00:31:27.653 --> 00:31:29.415]  It's actually scary.
[00:31:30.305 --> 00:31:40.394]  And it's because I take products that our researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[00:31:41.395 --> 00:31:54.187]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support Infowars in our fight for both human liberty and freedom.
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:04.863]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.
[00:32:05.083 --> 00:32:11.505]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds, even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[00:32:11.725 --> 00:32:20.008]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[00:32:20.288 --> 00:32:29.058]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[00:32:29.318 --> 00:32:35.065]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[00:32:35.405 --> 00:32:35.865]  It works.
[00:32:36.165 --> 00:32:44.467]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[00:32:44.487 --> 00:32:54.010]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarStore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the globalists all at the same time.
[00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.850]  A total 360 win.
[00:33:16.736 --> 00:33:21.871]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:33:22.392 --> 00:33:24.699]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:30.988 --> 00:33:50.035]  They're having their big Senate intel hearings on the eve of Comey tomorrow, all acting like they're these big patriots battling the evil imaginary Russian influence over Donald Trump, who just pulled us out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership that is the true globalist force.
[00:33:51.516 --> 00:33:53.558]  Transferring our national sovereignty out of the country.
[00:33:53.578 --> 00:33:54.799]  He just killed the Paris Accord.
[00:33:55.379 --> 00:34:14.595]  That is a 100 trillion per decade global tax to begin with, hatched by Kinley, Enron, and the Davos Group publicly, along with Al Gorb, where you pay a consortium of thousands of different billionaires and other consortiums trillions.
[00:34:14.615 --> 00:34:18.679]  And 167 countries are exempt, like China and Mexico.
[00:34:20.691 --> 00:34:23.574]  We've already made cuts in carbon dioxide.
[00:34:24.735 --> 00:34:25.897]  They can run the dirty plants.
[00:34:26.077 --> 00:34:31.002]  And then Trump comes out and does that and they come out like he is the anti-Christ.
[00:34:33.365 --> 00:34:41.534]  Now there are new stories that are about to go up on Infowars.com where investigative journalist Dr. Jerome Corsi has bombshell intel
[00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:50.101]  That Comey is a Clinton operative and a Clinton fixer, and we know that, but he's got even more evidence.
[00:34:50.522 --> 00:34:54.603]  And just to give you an example of why you should support us, I have such limited writing and crew, and they're so busy.
[00:34:54.643 --> 00:34:55.904]  We've got two articles from Corsi.
[00:34:56.204 --> 00:35:00.486]  We've still got to basically edit and get up to date, and we're trying to hire more writers and more crew.
[00:35:00.506 --> 00:35:06.369]  We're fighting as hard as we can, but that's why your prayers and financial support is more important than ever, because we're doing groundbreaking work.
[00:35:06.429 --> 00:35:08.229]  This is why they're coming after us.
[00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:13.952]  The investigative work that Corsi's doing is becoming a roadmap at Capitol Hill and at the White House.
[00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:17.480]  to bring down so many frauds.
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:27.583]  And when he broke the $300 billion that Obama criminally stole from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and then the minutiae came out and confirmed it two months later, and we got the credit, they got even more pissed.
[00:35:27.663 --> 00:35:30.503]  I mean, they are getting angry right now.
[00:35:31.103 --> 00:35:33.784]  And I've got all sorts of threats flying at me.
[00:35:33.864 --> 00:35:35.884]  I mean, they are letting me know, you back off, buddy.
[00:35:36.324 --> 00:35:37.465]  How am I supposed to back off?
[00:35:37.505 --> 00:35:38.545]  It's not like you're just looting $300 billion.
[00:35:39.628 --> 00:35:42.712]  I mean, you're funding radical jihadists trying to bring them into the country.
[00:35:42.952 --> 00:35:50.221]  I got a stack of news here where they're saying they're not going to treat women in Europe for rape now because the money's got to go to refugees.
[00:35:50.361 --> 00:35:51.442]  I'm not kidding.
[00:35:54.446 --> 00:35:56.068]  They're rubbing our faces in it.
[00:35:56.088 --> 00:35:58.130]  Look, Ramadan, terrorist death toll hits 180.
[00:36:00.017 --> 00:36:03.378]  Third London Bridge attack reportedly told authorities I'm going to be a terrorist.
[00:36:03.999 --> 00:36:09.461]  Fatalities and injuries after shooting bombings in Iranian parliament and Khomeini shrine by the Wahhabis.
[00:36:10.181 --> 00:36:15.003]  Woman screaming Allah Akbar charged in Toronto store attack.
[00:36:15.223 --> 00:36:15.864]  Toronto Sun.
[00:36:16.864 --> 00:36:21.307]  CNS News, UN Report, 163 civilians executed by Islamic State in Mosul.
[00:36:21.527 --> 00:36:22.108]  That just happened.
[00:36:22.508 --> 00:36:28.772]  Notre Dame terrorist was given an award by EU for complaining about racism against migrants.
[00:36:29.452 --> 00:36:32.454]  Paul Joseph Watson, Infowars.com, links to mainstream news.
[00:36:33.995 --> 00:36:42.021]  Schools in lockdown after female nursery worker on her way to work is pulled to the ground and slashed in the arm by three girls shouting, Allah will get you.
[00:36:43.154 --> 00:36:48.659]  I just had Tommy Robinson on two days ago where they're housing a guy who says he wants to be with ISIS and that gays should all be killed.
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:51.542]  Who hangs around, you know, with the known terrorists.
[00:36:52.263 --> 00:36:55.546]  He's got police protection in his house that they put him in a fancy area.
[00:36:55.866 --> 00:37:00.590]  Taxpayer paid for next to a girls elementary school.
[00:37:01.071 --> 00:37:03.273]  And his back fence is the playground.
[00:37:04.753 --> 00:37:05.934]  We have HD video of this.
[00:37:06.235 --> 00:37:10.700]  He's got a big beard walking on the street going, I will kill whoever I love to kill.
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:12.302]  I'll kill you.
[00:37:12.382 --> 00:37:13.283]  Literally saying that.
[00:37:13.984 --> 00:37:15.325]  And nothing's being done.
[00:37:15.345 --> 00:37:17.067]  I mean, this is just insane asylum.
[00:37:17.588 --> 00:37:19.270]  So, here's another one.
[00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:21.813]  Germany, surgeons, stabbings, and knife crimes.
[00:37:24.398 --> 00:37:33.402]  Swedish government orders clinic to end treatment for rape victims in favor of treating migrants, and this links to mainstream state-sponsored television.
[00:37:33.462 --> 00:37:34.962]  I mean, this is them saying it!
[00:37:36.463 --> 00:37:37.303]  You can't make it up!
[00:37:38.164 --> 00:37:39.024]  We will riot!
[00:37:39.664 --> 00:37:43.446]  Corbyn supporters threaten violence if Labor doesn't win election.
[00:37:43.466 --> 00:37:44.666]  Yeah, burn down more cities.
[00:37:45.266 --> 00:37:46.107]  These people are unbelievable.
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:47.601]  Oh, but don't worry.
[00:37:47.681 --> 00:37:50.784]  TSA may extend ban on laptops to domestic flights.
[00:37:51.084 --> 00:37:52.946]  Yeah, don't stop the radical jihadis coming in.
[00:37:53.266 --> 00:37:57.310]  Don't have a ban on the seven countries that don't have real vetting, don't have real passports.
[00:37:57.370 --> 00:37:57.670]  No, no, no.
[00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:59.732]  Bring them in and then all of us lose our rights.
[00:38:00.733 --> 00:38:01.294]  See how that works?
[00:38:02.735 --> 00:38:06.459]  Another powerful article by John Rapoport exposed the Nazi roots of the European Union.
[00:38:06.519 --> 00:38:08.520]  It's a historical fact that it was a dream of Hitler.
[00:38:08.941 --> 00:38:09.782]  Let's just stop right there.
[00:38:09.802 --> 00:38:10.642]  I've got to go to Dr. Corsi.
[00:38:11.994 --> 00:38:13.556]  His articles will be filed as we speak.
[00:38:13.616 --> 00:38:14.276]  Kit's working on it.
[00:38:14.296 --> 00:38:18.380]  And Kit's one of our top writers, but he's so busy, he's posted most of Courtsey's stuff.
[00:38:18.661 --> 00:38:23.405]  We're working on getting some more writers, some more editors, because we just got so much intel.
[00:38:23.445 --> 00:38:25.928]  And listen, everything we're posting is an important story.
[00:38:25.968 --> 00:38:31.614]  So, ferret through our newsfeed, subscribe to our newsfeed, dig through the stories, share them.
[00:38:31.754 --> 00:38:32.454]  It's a war!
[00:38:33.095 --> 00:38:34.317]  And we're starting to turn the corner.
[00:38:34.637 --> 00:38:36.760]  That's why the enemy's fighting back so hard.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.763]  And speaking of that, let's go to this clip first.
[00:38:39.223 --> 00:38:40.024]  America's back.
[00:38:40.325 --> 00:38:41.166]  We'll play that second.
[00:38:41.606 --> 00:38:44.490]  They would rather see him fail than have America succeed.
[00:38:45.231 --> 00:38:46.072]  Eric's almost right.
[00:38:46.991 --> 00:38:50.033]  They want Trump to fail because he wants America to succeed.
[00:38:50.073 --> 00:38:51.434]  That's what his dad said last week.
[00:38:52.095 --> 00:38:54.697]  They have carbon taxes on us that other countries don't have.
[00:38:55.197 --> 00:38:56.939]  That is discriminatory.
[00:38:57.239 --> 00:38:58.220]  That's globalism.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:38:59.801]  That's what the globalists have done.
[00:38:59.841 --> 00:39:06.566]  The John McCain's of the world have sold us out for their own personal gain to multinationals to exploit third world populations.
[00:39:09.028 --> 00:39:11.170]  So, they want us to fail.
[00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:13.872]  Let's play the Eric Trump clip from Hannity last night.
[00:39:14.887 --> 00:39:17.730]  My father's a great man, and he's going to do a great job for this country.
[00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:20.392]  But honestly, we need to bring some principle back.
[00:39:20.592 --> 00:39:21.853]  We have to bring some manners back.
[00:39:21.973 --> 00:39:24.135]  We need to bring some respect back.
[00:39:25.577 --> 00:39:25.957]  It's sad.
[00:39:25.997 --> 00:39:27.438]  He's going to do a great job for this nation.
[00:39:27.619 --> 00:39:30.561]  I mean, he already has done a great job for this nation.
[00:39:30.581 --> 00:39:35.446]  I think he'll be the only person that ever reports a success or the things he's accomplished and the promises he's kept.
[00:39:35.486 --> 00:39:36.366]  They would rather see him.
[00:39:36.847 --> 00:39:38.548]  They would rather see him fail.
[00:39:39.409 --> 00:39:40.470]  Then have America succeed.
[00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:42.492]  And I've said that a million times and I really believe it.
[00:39:42.532 --> 00:39:45.135]  That's the ugliness of Washington, D.C.
[00:39:45.836 --> 00:39:49.059]  I can totally understand the passion that you're showing.
[00:39:49.079 --> 00:39:50.281]  Eric, great to see you.
[00:39:50.301 --> 00:39:50.881]  Thanks for doing this.
[00:39:51.101 --> 00:39:52.523]  And congratulations on the baby too.
[00:39:52.563 --> 00:39:53.043]  Thank you very much.
[00:39:53.953 --> 00:40:02.276]  Let's continue, the only thing left on Fox, Fox and Friends is okay, and then you've got Tucker, and then you've got Hannity, it's just, other than that, all their best stuff is on Fox Business.
[00:40:03.076 --> 00:40:05.057]  And then no one's watching that, it's just a real shame.
[00:40:05.077 --> 00:40:06.938]  They're killing it on purpose, by the way, that's admitted.
[00:40:07.138 --> 00:40:09.839]  We told you that back in July from Insider, it's now confirmed.
[00:40:09.879 --> 00:40:12.080]  Here's Eric Trump saying America's back, then we're going to Corsi.
[00:40:13.722 --> 00:40:14.842]  How about Don, right?
[00:40:14.862 --> 00:40:18.344]  How about the whole family who is by his side every single day?
[00:40:18.884 --> 00:40:20.404]  Every single day we were sitting there fighting.
[00:40:20.444 --> 00:40:21.544]  We had a very, very small team.
[00:40:22.025 --> 00:40:22.785]  I've said it from the beginning.
[00:40:22.805 --> 00:40:24.145]  We don't have projects in Russia.
[00:40:24.525 --> 00:40:26.866]  We don't have loans from Russia.
[00:40:26.926 --> 00:40:28.707]  I've said this a thousand times.
[00:40:28.747 --> 00:40:29.127]  We had no
[00:40:29.947 --> 00:40:31.567]  Involvement in Russia.
[00:40:31.867 --> 00:40:33.228]  But there's no other narrative.
[00:40:33.508 --> 00:40:35.608]  They don't have the voice of the American people.
[00:40:36.068 --> 00:40:38.269]  They don't have things that make sense for this country.
[00:40:38.589 --> 00:40:40.749]  They did a terrible job with jobs.
[00:40:40.769 --> 00:40:42.490]  They lost industry.
[00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:43.590]  They lost the economy.
[00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:45.671]  I mean, look at the stock market right now.
[00:40:45.711 --> 00:40:48.351]  Under my father, since Election Day, the stock market is up 15%.
[00:40:48.931 --> 00:40:49.211]  I mean, 15%.
[00:40:51.952 --> 00:40:52.813]  Since Election Day.
[00:40:53.274 --> 00:40:56.497]  Consumer confidence is at an all-time high.
[00:40:56.597 --> 00:40:58.119]  America is back.
[00:40:58.159 --> 00:41:00.562]  You see how he's treated when he goes over to the Middle East.
[00:41:01.062 --> 00:41:02.905]  Versus Obama when he came off Air Force One.
[00:41:02.945 --> 00:41:05.528]  They wouldn't even bring a set of stairs up to the plane.
[00:41:05.548 --> 00:41:07.350]  That's how little respect they had for this nation.
[00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:09.652]  And honestly, it scares the other side, Sean.
[00:41:09.752 --> 00:41:10.994]  It scares the other party.
[00:41:12.455 --> 00:41:16.580]  That's right, Trump gets big respect because he really is the president now and they know he means business.
[00:41:17.061 --> 00:41:24.951]  Dr. Corsi, it's just fascinating to see how much the left, how much the globalists really hate this country and then how truly sliming...
[00:41:26.212 --> 00:41:35.762]  Comey is covering up the pedo gate, the real emails, the real pizza gate, all of that, and now working openly against President Trump.
[00:41:35.822 --> 00:41:40.767]  What is your intel on what we should expect tomorrow as everybody holds their breath?
[00:41:40.787 --> 00:41:46.512]  They got happy hour, you know, starting at 8 in the morning so everybody can watch it as if it's some drunken spectacle in D.C.
[00:41:47.473 --> 00:41:50.594]  We've got Comey lied to Congress about NSA mass illegal surveillance of U.S.
[00:41:50.634 --> 00:41:51.054]  citizens.
[00:41:51.494 --> 00:41:54.455]  Now that's going up right now on Infowars.com by Dr. Corsi.
[00:41:54.896 --> 00:41:56.456]  Everybody needs to retweet these.
[00:41:56.716 --> 00:41:57.697]  This is an Infowar.
[00:41:57.757 --> 00:41:58.557]  Real Alex Jones.
[00:41:58.857 --> 00:41:59.437]  Dr. Corsi?
[00:42:00.317 --> 00:42:07.580]  Well, first of all, I put this article on Comey being a Clinton fixer because I wanted it very clear to set the stage.
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:14.462]  And by the way, the White House is going to fight back tomorrow and going to fight back hard against Comey.
[00:42:15.022 --> 00:42:16.643]  But going back to Whitewater,
[00:42:17.404 --> 00:42:26.829]  When Comey was involved, he was a special counsel of the Senate Whitewater Committee, there was a big attempt to really suppress the information.
[00:42:26.909 --> 00:42:37.575]  We now know from documents that have been released largely by Judicial Watch that prosecutors were actually writing up an indictment of Hillary Clinton and Whitewater and it was stopped.
[00:42:38.276 --> 00:42:40.397]  Then, it's just you go through all the cases.
[00:42:41.252 --> 00:43:00.425]  After Whitewater, you come to the Sandy Berger case, where Sandy Berger, who worked in the Clinton White House, was overtaking documents out of the archives that would have implicated Clinton in knowing about the plots that ultimately became the 9-11 plot and doing nothing about them.
[00:43:01.025 --> 00:43:08.012]  And of course, you have Comey in the Department of Justice, who is then serving as a Deputy Attorney General.
[00:43:08.513 --> 00:43:19.904]  He limited the criminal investigations of Sandy Berger so as to protect anybody in the Clinton administration who may have coordinated with Berger in his removal and destruction of classified records from the archives.
[00:43:21.065 --> 00:43:21.966]  It goes on and on.
[00:43:21.986 --> 00:43:22.627]  You find that
[00:43:24.359 --> 00:43:34.842]  Sandy Berger, Loretta Lynch, Cheryl Mills all worked in this law firm together, Hogan Hartson, to prepare the taxes for the Clintons.
[00:43:34.862 --> 00:43:37.303]  They were all basically in this together.
[00:43:38.003 --> 00:43:48.746]  And as you go forward and look at all the legal connections between these various groups, every time there's an issue, Comey then gets on the board of HSBC.
[00:43:49.666 --> 00:43:51.387]  He's again now dealing with Lynch,
[00:43:52.119 --> 00:43:52.780]  Who is now U.S.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.062]  Attorney for the Southern District of New York.
[00:43:55.762 --> 00:44:00.446]  I find that HSBC, I reported, was engaged in a massive money laundering scheme.
[00:44:01.387 --> 00:44:04.930]  HSBC pays a $1.9 billion fine.
[00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:08.172]  Loretta Lynch excuses no criminal prosecutions.
[00:44:08.773 --> 00:44:13.557]  And on the board of HSBC, we find again Comey.
[00:44:14.178 --> 00:44:15.098]  It just goes on and on.
[00:44:15.158 --> 00:44:16.499]  The same with the Valerie Plame scandal.
[00:44:37.142 --> 00:44:40.063]  Where, you know, Comey was involved.
[00:44:40.803 --> 00:44:42.284]  Ashcroft recused himself.
[00:44:42.404 --> 00:44:48.405]  Comey and the Department of Justice appointed Patrick Fitzgerald, who ended up as the special prosecutor.
[00:44:48.886 --> 00:44:54.547]  He convicted Scooter Liddy, who was then an aide to Vice President Cheney.
[00:44:55.147 --> 00:44:57.648]  And again, as we find out, that case evolved.
[00:44:58.168 --> 00:45:04.490]  It was based on, again, dirty data, lies, etc., that had been used to convict Scooter Liddy.
[00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:06.731]  And Comey was at the center of that.
[00:45:07.971 --> 00:45:10.273]  Comey then goes to work for the Lockheed Board.
[00:45:11.034 --> 00:45:14.736]  He earned $6 million between 2005 and 2010.
[00:45:16.898 --> 00:45:24.764]  Lockheed joins the Clinton Global Initiative and gets 17 contracts from the State Department, while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.
[00:45:25.264 --> 00:45:30.868]  So people should make no doubt about it that Comey is a Clinton operative.
[00:45:30.888 --> 00:45:31.549]  He's a fixer.
[00:45:32.173 --> 00:45:56.626]  He's been there from the very beginning going back to Whitewater and having a series of interferences with in the Justice Department where the Clintons get a pass and then Comey gets board positions on which he makes millions of dollars and also makes sure the corporations are rewarded like HSBC getting off with a major fine but no criminal prosecutions and money laundering scandal and Lockheed
[00:45:57.747 --> 00:46:03.291]  Martin, basically contributing money to the Clinton Global Initiative and winning contracts from the State Department.
[00:46:03.792 --> 00:46:08.515]  This is a pattern of corruption that should make it clear to everyone listening to Comey tomorrow.
[00:46:08.535 --> 00:46:09.596]  And the article is going up.
[00:46:10.256 --> 00:46:11.778]  I'd like this article circulated.
[00:46:11.798 --> 00:46:13.599]  The White House would like this information out.
[00:46:14.279 --> 00:46:20.044]  I think we need to have framed Comey as a Clinton fixer before he starts testifying.
[00:46:20.404 --> 00:46:21.645]  That's the first article, Alex.
[00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:34.764]  And by the way, you've done more research on this, but it's mainstream news that he was involved in the big nefarious bank, that he was working for the Clintons, that he was put in all these key positions and brought in by Obama to basically cover up all the crimes they were committing.
[00:46:35.064 --> 00:46:38.265]  He is a Democrat operative going after Trump.
[00:46:39.145 --> 00:46:42.589]  And I just wish Trump wouldn't have played nice and given him the benefit of the doubt.
[00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:48.356]  I wish he'd have fired him day one when the Democrats were saying fire him, fire him, fire him, fire him, fire him.
[00:46:49.397 --> 00:46:51.239]  But hindsight's 20-20.
[00:46:51.679 --> 00:46:53.521]  But no evidence of this Russia narrative.
[00:46:56.687 --> 00:47:12.075]  What about Comey contradicting himself on May 3rd from the supposed memo that nobody can see from back in February and saying that no one ever tried to influence him on the Russia investigation and then supposedly contradicting himself with this memo?
[00:47:13.183 --> 00:47:15.284]  Well, there's several things that he kind of did.
[00:47:15.344 --> 00:47:32.329]  First of all, I want to comment also, I've been running a major campaign on my Twitter account, which is Jerome underscore Corsi, and I'll be writing about it, and as soon as I get a chance, Alex, I've quite frankly been writing non-stop for about 10 days, about 10 hours a day, to try to just get all this information out.
[00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:38.832]  But there's a major move to replace Priebus as the Chief of Staff.
[00:47:38.912 --> 00:47:42.433]  The major problem the White House has got is Priebus is a
[00:47:43.354 --> 00:47:51.059]  Tony, with his connections in the GOP establishment in DC, his meal ticket is Ryan and McConnell.
[00:47:51.619 --> 00:47:56.682]  And what I've been advising through the Twitter feed is that first of all,
[00:47:58.077 --> 00:48:09.820]  President Obama's got to realize he's in the middle of a coup d'etat that's being engineered by the deep state with the cooperation of the Democratic Party, full cooperation, and the GOP establishment in D.C.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.961]  You're talking about President Trump has to understand that.
[00:48:12.301 --> 00:48:18.382]  President Trump is getting in the middle of a coup d'etat that's being engineered and they intend to impeach him.
[00:48:19.122 --> 00:48:21.523]  Now Priebus doesn't have, if Priebus
[00:48:22.339 --> 00:48:23.920]  Loses his job or whatever.
[00:48:24.381 --> 00:48:30.245]  If Trump is impeached, Priebus just goes to work for another one of the GOP establishments.
[00:48:30.325 --> 00:48:31.226]  It's his meal ticket.
[00:48:31.266 --> 00:48:33.648]  He calls up Ryan and McConnell and gets another job.
[00:48:34.691 --> 00:48:38.774]  Priebus is not loyal, he's not strong, he's botched everything.
[00:48:38.874 --> 00:48:46.160]  In fact, the major problems the Trump White House is experiencing is they do not have an effective chief of staff.
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:48.742]  Well, we keep hearing that there's a big shakeup imminent.
[00:48:49.323 --> 00:48:52.645]  Do you think Trump's just waiting until this FBI hearing comes up?
[00:48:52.705 --> 00:48:59.731]  And of course, also Trump's announced his new FBI director, Christopher Wray, I guess is a way to overshadow this hearing tomorrow?
[00:49:00.783 --> 00:49:03.125]  I think it's a part of just getting things in place.
[00:49:03.185 --> 00:49:17.017]  I mean, they're under such assault from within, and there's so many yet holdovers from Clinton and Obama, even in the Trump White House, that I'm pounding on every day to get rid of.
[00:49:18.198 --> 00:49:20.220]  But let's go back to the Comey for tomorrow.
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:22.102]  I want to make sure we get this second article in.
[00:49:22.992 --> 00:49:25.695]  You know, basically, Comey's lied to Congress a number of times.
[00:49:26.175 --> 00:49:31.060]  First of all, they have no evidence that there's been any Russian collusion.
[00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:35.965]  This is a complete propaganda effort being run by the Democrats.
[00:49:36.165 --> 00:49:42.872]  But what we do know is that Comey lied to Congress in your new article coming out about NSA mass illegal surveillance of U.S.
[00:49:42.912 --> 00:49:45.355]  citizens, including Donald Trump and yours truly.
[00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:47.329]  Well this is really important.
[00:49:47.369 --> 00:49:59.812]  We reported, remember we reported that this Dennis Montgomery, who was a ex-Intel, came out of the NSA with something like 47 hard drives and he gave them to Sheriff Arpaio.
[00:49:59.832 --> 00:50:05.673]  This is when I was working with Sheriff Arpaio in the middle of conducting this investigation on the birth certificate.
[00:50:06.134 --> 00:50:12.115]  Now what these hard drives showed, and we reported this, Drudge linked to it in March,
[00:50:12.927 --> 00:50:13.227]  We're good.
[00:50:32.977 --> 00:50:37.481]  Sure, that was a big story, but mainstream media dared not touch it because it was real.
[00:50:37.902 --> 00:50:40.143]  It was all of Donald Trump's real phone numbers, you name it.
[00:50:40.444 --> 00:50:41.845]  Phone numbers that nobody knew I had.
[00:50:41.865 --> 00:50:42.526]  It was all in there.
[00:50:42.946 --> 00:50:44.767]  And of course this came through Arpaio and others.
[00:50:44.808 --> 00:50:51.894]  We'll be right back to break this down on the other side with Comey telling Congress why nobody gets spied on in America.
[00:50:51.934 --> 00:50:53.235]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[00:50:53.515 --> 00:50:54.176]  Lordy, lordy.
[00:50:55.347 --> 00:50:59.749]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[00:50:59.829 --> 00:51:10.773]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[00:51:10.933 --> 00:51:15.855]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[00:51:15.975 --> 00:51:18.496]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[00:51:18.556 --> 00:51:20.057]  It helps detoxify.
[00:51:20.277 --> 00:51:23.118]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[00:51:23.158 --> 00:51:27.900]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:34.163]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[00:51:34.203 --> 00:51:39.506]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[00:51:39.526 --> 00:51:40.286]  I'm taking it now.
[00:51:40.506 --> 00:51:41.027]  Every day.
[00:51:41.227 --> 00:51:41.948]  This is so key.
[00:51:42.208 --> 00:51:44.530]  BioTrue Selenium is the product.
[00:51:44.771 --> 00:51:46.512]  The best selenium that we could bring you.
[00:51:46.532 --> 00:51:48.635]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[00:51:48.775 --> 00:51:52.218]  Exclusively available at InfowarsLive.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:52:00.052 --> 00:52:05.619]  Does your shampoo leave your scalp itchy and your hair dry and frizzy?
[00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:11.565]  Introducing Emrix Essentials Natural Herbal Shampoo.
[00:52:12.146 --> 00:52:16.791]  Made with organic oils for an exhilarating fragrance.

[00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:40.391]  Go natural!

[00:52:45.134 --> 00:52:46.675]  Nothing to weigh you down.
[00:52:47.215 --> 00:52:54.100]  Get cleaner, healthier hair with Emrix Essentials Tea Tree Shampoo.
[00:52:55.279 --> 00:52:58.804]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[00:52:59.265 --> 00:53:05.313]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[00:53:05.713 --> 00:53:08.517]  It is the new t-shirt from InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:53:08.898 --> 00:53:11.882]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:53:12.082 --> 00:53:15.525]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[00:53:15.865 --> 00:53:17.627]  The left controls culture.
[00:53:17.647 --> 00:53:18.628]  They control arts.
[00:53:18.688 --> 00:53:19.929]  They control entertainment.
[00:53:20.229 --> 00:53:27.315]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[00:53:27.355 --> 00:53:29.757]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[00:53:30.257 --> 00:53:34.121]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[00:53:34.161 --> 00:53:36.243]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate
[00:53:36.843 --> 00:53:42.229]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[00:53:42.489 --> 00:53:48.755]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[00:53:48.815 --> 00:53:50.517]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[00:53:50.657 --> 00:53:51.838]  It's available right now.
[00:53:52.159 --> 00:53:54.661]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[00:53:58.223 --> 00:54:01.705]  Alright, a couple more segments with Dr. Jerome Corsi with really huge breaking news.
[00:54:01.725 --> 00:54:07.570]  If you go to the front page of Infowars.com, there's a new Ben Garrison cartoon out with Queen Hillary on it.
[00:54:08.090 --> 00:54:14.034]  And it's got the dozens, I guess 20 or so reasons she's publicly put out that she lost the election.
[00:54:14.194 --> 00:54:14.735]  Russia.
[00:54:15.495 --> 00:54:16.196]  WikiLeaks.
[00:54:18.097 --> 00:54:19.138]  None of it's Hillary Clinton.
[00:54:19.658 --> 00:54:20.519]  Alex Jones.
[00:54:23.021 --> 00:54:26.263]  She goes on to say that Trump loomed misogyny.
[00:54:26.863 --> 00:54:27.664]  The polls.
[00:54:29.292 --> 00:54:30.612]  The Electoral College!
[00:54:32.213 --> 00:54:33.893]  But there she is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:34.213 --> 00:54:34.973]  Very powerful.
[00:54:37.934 --> 00:54:39.595]  Dr. Corsi, let me ask you this question.
[00:54:39.815 --> 00:54:46.256]  And then we'll come back in the next segment and get more into the Comey lying and admittedly the spying and how big a liar he is.
[00:54:46.276 --> 00:54:52.478]  I mean, he's been caught red-handed two months after he does this memo telling Congress nobody tried to influence him, period.
[00:54:53.530 --> 00:54:56.132]  We're laughing about it, saying it's preposterous, it's ridiculous.
[00:54:56.732 --> 00:55:01.155]  But again, the media just ignores that, even writes articles saying that it's a hoax, it's not real video.
[00:55:01.455 --> 00:55:02.996]  I mean, they must really think we're stupid.
[00:55:04.057 --> 00:55:06.639]  But I've seen it in the polls, but I've also seen it on the street.
[00:55:07.099 --> 00:55:10.702]  About two weeks ago, people started really turning against the Russia narrative.
[00:55:10.722 --> 00:55:13.864]  I mean, they never bought it, but they force-fed it so hard.
[00:55:15.384 --> 00:55:18.906]  That even mainstream news is admitting it's becoming a huge joke and people are sick of it.
[00:55:19.306 --> 00:55:22.887]  But the neocons, the rhinos, the Democrats, the deep state, they don't care.
[00:55:23.248 --> 00:55:25.329]  They're going forward sharpening their knives.
[00:55:25.909 --> 00:55:27.390]  What's the word on the street in D.C.?
[00:55:27.410 --> 00:55:30.291]  Because Trump just keeps delivering, delivering on the economy.
[00:55:31.191 --> 00:55:31.992]  Spectacular.
[00:55:32.472 --> 00:55:34.773]  Pulling out of the Paris global carbon tax.
[00:55:35.093 --> 00:55:37.934]  And the Democrats respond, just everywhere saying, we're going to kill him.
[00:55:38.535 --> 00:55:40.776]  In fact, here's an Infowars.com article, Steve Watson.
[00:55:41.656 --> 00:55:44.537]  Play in the New York features Donald Trump being stabbed to death.
[00:55:44.557 --> 00:55:52.299]  And then you've got, obviously, the Allah Akbar stuff, and you've got Griffin, Kathy Griffin, running around with a severed head.
[00:55:52.339 --> 00:56:01.182]  I mean, these people are really pushing for violent confrontations with everybody, like somebody trying to talk themselves into jumping off the edge of a cliff.
[00:56:03.043 --> 00:56:06.704]  Well, what's going on, I mean, even within the White House, first of all,
[00:56:07.752 --> 00:56:11.238]  Trump is coming to realize that this is serious business.
[00:56:11.258 --> 00:56:13.100]  This is not New York anymore.
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:14.542]  This is not business.
[00:56:15.163 --> 00:56:18.448]  This is politics in Washington, D.C.
[00:56:18.468 --> 00:56:19.009]  This is war!
[00:56:22.526 --> 00:56:26.247]  The intelligence agencies are out to cat impeachment.
[00:56:26.668 --> 00:56:30.209]  The Democrats have joined them and the GOP establishment's there.
[00:56:30.929 --> 00:56:36.932]  And let's be clear though, it's the rogue network shadow government, Democrat and foundation elites at the top.
[00:56:37.972 --> 00:56:40.633]  On average, the intelligence agencies and the military are behind Trump.
[00:56:41.193 --> 00:56:42.214]  Well, and see, the point is,
[00:56:43.365 --> 00:56:48.647]  For instance, let's just take the issue, you know, we've got credentials and we've got to apply for them every week.
[00:56:48.847 --> 00:57:00.050]  Okay, the word I've gotten from high authorities is that Priebus is blocking and wants to block InfoWars from getting permanent credentials and is saying that we're not a legitimate news agency.
[00:57:00.590 --> 00:57:12.853]  Now, they've gone into the White House press room, the front row, and by the way, that's a small little stupid room, was where Jack Kennedy used to do naked swimming with his girlfriends from the interns in the White House.
[00:57:12.873 --> 00:57:15.173]  That has been converted into the press room.
[00:57:16.033 --> 00:57:17.894]  It's inadequate for a facility.
[00:57:18.654 --> 00:57:22.535]  Mainstream media has given the front row to do an act up anti-Trump
[00:57:23.155 --> 00:57:24.615]  Our televised every day.
[00:57:24.635 --> 00:57:35.598]  Yeah, Trump's got to get rid of it, move it to a bigger building, and we've talked about that, and Priebus is in there keeping it that way, and why isn't the president giving us, you know, the fireside chat?
[00:57:35.838 --> 00:57:37.718]  He's got to bypass these enemies now.
[00:57:38.258 --> 00:57:41.819]  Well, he's also got to get rid of Priebus, he's got to get rid of these people out of the White House.
[00:57:42.179 --> 00:57:49.281]  I understand that, but let me ask you, if you have a lot of White House contacts, and I know it's getting to the president, why isn't he doing at least a weekly fireside chat now?
[00:57:49.821 --> 00:57:50.462]  Well, he should be.
[00:57:50.482 --> 00:57:53.285]  I mean, his Twitters essentially amount to it, his tweets.
[00:57:53.685 --> 00:57:55.367]  Yesterday, the press attacked the tweets.
[00:57:55.407 --> 00:57:59.011]  They want to get him to stop tweeting because he owes directly to the people.
[00:57:59.051 --> 00:58:02.274]  That's the modern-day equivalent of the fireside chats.
[00:58:02.675 --> 00:58:03.616]  And they're very effective.
[00:58:03.656 --> 00:58:04.597]  They do reach people.
[00:58:04.977 --> 00:58:07.300]  Trump still has the support of the electorate.
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:08.100]  That's
[00:58:28.166 --> 00:58:29.548]  The truth is he's sabotaging him.
[00:58:29.648 --> 00:58:34.536]  Trump has to start crushing people one by one legitimately by showing how they hate America.
[00:58:34.556 --> 00:58:38.722]  He needs to destroy people one by one starting with Paul Ryan.
[00:58:39.403 --> 00:58:40.825]  We'll be right back in 60 seconds.
[00:58:45.382 --> 00:58:54.728]  You might think the best ways to stop terrorism is maybe extreme vetting, not allowing unvetted refugees into your home, maybe not trying to do so many regime changes in Middle Eastern countries.
[00:58:54.848 --> 00:58:56.049]  Well, you're all wrong.
[00:58:56.249 --> 00:59:01.533]  In fact, Hillary Clinton says a way to stop terrorism is to understand other cultures and their food.
[00:59:01.653 --> 00:59:02.093]  Yes, really.
[00:59:02.233 --> 00:59:12.808]  She also defended London Mayor Siti Khan, the man who once represented 9-11 Al-Qaeda member Zacharias Moussaoui, called moderate Muslims Uncle Tom's, and said terrorism was part and parcel to living in a major city.
[00:59:12.988 --> 00:59:15.612]  And she added, Khan has shown steady, determined leadership.
[00:59:15.652 --> 00:59:18.356]  Hillary said the best way to combating terror is to reach out to the world.
[00:59:18.456 --> 00:59:20.497]  In order to understand people living in foreign countries.
[00:59:20.617 --> 00:59:21.518]  Getting to know one another.
[00:59:21.618 --> 00:59:25.341]  Learning about the experiences, the lives, the cultures, the religions, the food.
[00:59:25.401 --> 00:59:29.944]  So does this mean we gotta be like into stoning women, cutting off their genitals and throwing gays off buildings?
[00:59:30.064 --> 00:59:34.947]  This is not a time to lash out, to incite fear, to use tragedy and terror for political gain, said Clinton.
[00:59:35.087 --> 00:59:36.689]  A comment obviously aimed at Donald Trump.
[00:59:36.729 --> 00:59:42.693]  And anyone else who has correctly identified political correctness and tolerance of Islam as creating a fertile ground for terrorist attacks in the Western world.
[00:59:42.853 --> 00:59:45.695]  Rob Dewar reporting for InfoWars Nightly News and InfoWars.com.
[01:00:05.805 --> 01:00:09.927]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:00:10.687 --> 01:00:12.148]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:23.414]  Make no mistake, this country is at its most historic moments in 1776, and now the world's future hangs in the balance.
[01:00:24.294 --> 01:00:25.495]  The stakes couldn't be higher.
[01:00:27.075 --> 01:00:34.279]  And... If you'd have told me ten years ago, Donald Trump would be at the center of it, I would just roll my eyes and laugh at you.
[01:00:36.371 --> 01:00:56.077]  But studying Trump, knowing his history, understanding that he was just doing business, and being a PR guy, with that persona, and that the real persona, going back to when he was in college, is being an anti-New World Order patriot, and to now see where we are in this country, and to see how many people support the President, but they have to understand how life and death this is.
[01:00:56.818 --> 01:00:57.478]  This is war.
[01:00:58.575 --> 01:01:01.138]  And the globalists want to continue to run this country and they're panicked.
[01:01:01.799 --> 01:01:05.343]  But it is telltale how much respect he got, especially in the Middle East and other areas.
[01:01:05.843 --> 01:01:13.172]  People act like they're scared of Trump over there because they understand that he just took control of this bureaucracy that had no respect for our country.
[01:01:13.632 --> 01:01:15.755]  And people don't respect people that have sold out.
[01:01:16.075 --> 01:01:17.697]  They respect people that are actually for real.
[01:01:17.737 --> 01:01:18.218]  Dr. Corsi.
[01:01:19.212 --> 01:01:20.673]  Well, this is exactly right.
[01:01:21.034 --> 01:01:24.036]  Trump has never been in a game like this before.
[01:01:25.257 --> 01:01:26.398]  It's different on Wall Street.
[01:01:26.458 --> 01:01:27.399]  It's different in New York.
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:28.840]  He's built buildings.
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:29.881]  He's fought the unions.
[01:01:30.682 --> 01:01:31.683]  This is the deep state.
[01:01:32.282 --> 01:01:36.285]  They'll lie, they'll swear under oath, Comey will lie.
[01:01:37.126 --> 01:01:40.768]  They are lying this morning to the Senate Intelligence Committee.
[01:01:41.549 --> 01:01:50.816]  They're begging to be in private, closed testimony where they can not be held accountable for what they're saying.
[01:01:51.536 --> 01:01:52.817]  This is a disgrace.
[01:01:55.096 --> 01:02:02.019]  Trump has got to understand, when the GOP leadership comes and meets with him in the White House, they're going to all nod and smile.
[01:02:02.059 --> 01:02:07.701]  They go out of there and they sharpen their knives and they're just as happy to carve Donald Trump up and throw him into the Potomac River.
[01:02:08.581 --> 01:02:10.682]  And this is a life and death fight.
[01:02:11.363 --> 01:02:15.105]  I mean, you know, Jack Kennedy underestimated him too.
[01:02:15.225 --> 01:02:18.226]  I was part of the group as a very young kid.
[01:02:18.266 --> 01:02:21.548]  I mean, a teenager trying to warn Jack Kennedy of the danger.
[01:02:21.988 --> 01:02:23.188]  Jack didn't perceive it either.
[01:02:23.248 --> 01:02:24.029]  Trump better listen.
[01:02:24.509 --> 01:02:27.710]  And Bobby didn't even have to kill his brother.
[01:02:28.771 --> 01:02:30.912]  Well, there was an attempt.
[01:02:31.292 --> 01:02:36.174]  I never did like Bobby as well as I got to like Jack, but there was an attempt to save Bobby too.
[01:02:36.234 --> 01:02:37.555]  Bobby was a very stubborn guy.
[01:02:37.575 --> 01:02:39.896]  I knew him reasonably well.
[01:02:41.257 --> 01:02:42.978]  But Jack Kennedy would listen.
[01:02:43.778 --> 01:02:51.259]  But he didn't really perceive the extent of the danger that he was facing for the deep state when they decided to remove him from power.
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:55.520]  And what's going on right now is Trump is in the middle of a coup d'etat.
[01:02:56.001 --> 01:03:00.902]  And he better quickly smarten up and realize that it's going to be a power game.
[01:03:01.462 --> 01:03:06.003]  And he's going to have to be able to get control of the RNC, get control of the money,
[01:03:06.809 --> 01:03:17.534]  You know, Lyndon Johnson would put his nose right up against your nose and breathe this hot, dirty breath into your face and tell you where you lived and what you'd done and how you were going to vote.
[01:03:18.354 --> 01:03:21.516]  Well, Donald Trump better start reading about Sam Rayburn.
[01:03:21.536 --> 01:03:23.097]  He better understand how Washington works.
[01:03:23.817 --> 01:03:34.062]  If he doesn't control the power of these committees, these moles within the FBI, within the Department of Justice, within the White House,
[01:03:34.918 --> 01:03:40.652]  The Soros operatives, the Clinton and Obama loyalists, they will destroy his presidency.
[01:03:41.534 --> 01:03:43.799]  And it's under way right now.
[01:03:43.839 --> 01:03:44.982]  This is a serious threat.
[01:03:46.003 --> 01:03:56.507]  We're facing it, you know, the media that got Trump in, and Trump is tweeting, he's saying if he'd listened to the New York Times and the, you know, the Washington Post and the like, he'd never be president.
[01:03:56.547 --> 01:04:00.329]  Well, he better figure out right now to get him out of the front row of that press room.
[01:04:00.689 --> 01:04:01.969]  Close that press room down.
[01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:10.113]  Well, exactly, and from Cernovich and my other sources, a month ago we had the headline, uh, patriots are about to be really pleased.
[01:04:11.075 --> 01:04:17.679]  With what Trump does, and he has made a more populous turn, and he understands that's what he's got to do now, but come back.
[01:04:17.699 --> 01:04:18.699]  We've got another guest coming up.
[01:04:18.719 --> 01:04:24.302]  I'll give you a few more minutes to talk about briefly what else you think he should do as a plan of action, but there it is.
[01:04:24.342 --> 01:04:33.608]  Patriots will be very happy with what Trump is about to do, and that was a month ago on, or a little less than a month ago, May 15th.
[01:04:34.128 --> 01:04:35.389]  It's now June 7th.
[01:04:36.269 --> 01:04:37.730]  So again, you can watch that.
[01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:40.472]  We also had articles there breaking all this down.
[01:04:40.573 --> 01:04:43.675]  Dr. Jerome Kors is our guest, writer with Infowars.com.
[01:04:44.236 --> 01:04:47.798]  The articles Comey lied to Congress about NSA mass illegal surveillance of U.S.
[01:04:47.818 --> 01:04:54.304]  citizens, including Donald Trump and Alex Jones, and FBI confirmed Comey was planted inside of the Clintons.
[01:04:55.123 --> 01:05:04.467]  You might think the best ways to stop terrorism is maybe extreme vetting, not allowing unvetted refugees into your home, maybe not trying to do so many regime changes in Middle Eastern countries.
[01:05:04.487 --> 01:05:05.788]  Well, you're all wrong.
[01:05:05.988 --> 01:05:11.291]  In fact, Hillary Clinton says a way to stop terrorism is to understand other cultures and their food.
[01:05:11.411 --> 01:05:11.851]  Yes, really.
[01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:22.557]  She also defended London Mayor Sidi Kahn, the man who once represented 9-11 Al-Qaeda member Zacharias Moussaoui, called moderate Muslims Uncle Tom's, and said terrorism was part and parcel to living in a major city.
[01:05:22.737 --> 01:05:25.358]  And she added, Kahn has shown steady, determined leadership.
[01:05:25.398 --> 01:05:28.100]  Hillary said the best way to combating terror is to reach out to the world.
[01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:30.241]  In order to understand people living in foreign countries.
[01:05:30.381 --> 01:05:31.261]  Getting to know one another.
[01:05:31.381 --> 01:05:35.203]  Learning about the experiences, the lives, the cultures, the religions, the food.
[01:05:35.383 --> 01:05:39.685]  So does this mean we gotta be like into stoning women, cutting off their genitals and throwing gays off buildings?
[01:05:39.825 --> 01:05:44.707]  This is not a time to lash out, to incite fear, to use tragedy and terror for political gain, said Clinton.
[01:05:44.827 --> 01:05:52.450]  A comment obviously aimed at Donald Trump and anyone else who has correctly identified political correctness and tolerance of Islam as creating a fertile ground for terrorist attacks in the Western world.
[01:05:52.590 --> 01:05:55.451]  Rob Dewar reporting for InfoWars Nightly News and InfoWars.com.
[01:05:56.488 --> 01:06:00.030]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[01:06:00.491 --> 01:06:06.515]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[01:06:06.755 --> 01:06:09.737]  It is the new t-shirt from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:06:10.117 --> 01:06:13.079]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:06:13.319 --> 01:06:16.742]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[01:06:17.082 --> 01:06:18.843]  The left controls culture.
[01:06:18.863 --> 01:06:19.844]  They control arts.
[01:06:19.924 --> 01:06:21.145]  They control entertainment.
[01:06:21.445 --> 01:06:28.531]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[01:06:28.591 --> 01:06:30.993]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[01:06:31.473 --> 01:06:35.336]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[01:06:35.376 --> 01:06:37.438]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate
[01:06:38.078 --> 01:06:43.443]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[01:06:43.703 --> 01:06:49.968]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[01:06:50.028 --> 01:06:51.730]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:53.051]  It's available right now.
[01:06:53.391 --> 01:06:55.573]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[01:06:56.574 --> 01:07:03.679]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.

[01:07:30.094 --> 01:07:36.056]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[01:08:05.768 --> 01:08:14.772]  In defense of human liberty, Alex Jones.
[01:08:15.052 --> 01:08:24.236]  Michael Schneider, judge, is here in about five minutes.
[01:08:25.956 --> 01:08:31.859]  The Trump army's taking the names of the treasonous Republicans that are suggesting Trump should be impeached.
[01:08:33.428 --> 01:08:35.109]  Another report, no more fake conservatives.
[01:08:36.089 --> 01:08:39.711]  If we don't fight for it, the liberal world order is going to kill our way of life.
[01:08:40.692 --> 01:08:43.233]  There comes a time when it becomes necessary to draw the line in the sand.
[01:08:44.213 --> 01:08:49.956]  When you look at the agenda of Hollywood and the globalists, I mean, it is so nightmarish.
[01:08:50.576 --> 01:08:53.038]  And they're allied with the most horrible forms of Islam.
[01:08:54.038 --> 01:08:55.979]  You know these people are the scum of the earth.
[01:08:56.699 --> 01:08:57.340]  Dr. Corsi,
[01:08:58.373 --> 01:09:00.655]  It's confirmed Comey was implanted the FBI by the Clintons.
[01:09:00.675 --> 01:09:03.318]  There's a report up there going over all the admissions of that.
[01:09:03.358 --> 01:09:04.599]  We need to get that meme out there.
[01:09:18.188 --> 01:09:26.875]  Comey is a Clinton operative to tweak that article from Infowars.com to Facebook, you name it, to push it out to everybody so they understand what this is about.
[01:09:27.596 --> 01:09:30.398]  And then also, a fact, we have the video of this as well.
[01:09:31.859 --> 01:09:33.601]  We should make this the big lead denial of the nightly news.
[01:09:34.121 --> 01:09:44.470]  Comey lied to Congress, just like Clapper, about NSA mass surveillance of US citizens, including Donald Trump and Alex Jones, and said it was insane, said it was kooky, said it was unbelievable.
[01:09:46.274 --> 01:09:49.456]  This is when the Democrats were all over the news saying, we've surveilled Trump.
[01:09:50.337 --> 01:09:51.458]  We know he talked to the Russians.
[01:09:51.498 --> 01:09:53.760]  Trump said, that's illegal if you did that, to leak that.
[01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:59.984]  Of course, they didn't have the intel, so they used the claim they had it, to put that out that they had been surveilling.
[01:10:01.646 --> 01:10:03.287]  So they're the ones committing the crimes.
[01:10:04.488 --> 01:10:06.910]  And we've seen this one lady, and we're going to know what Trump should do.
[01:10:09.793 --> 01:10:21.761]  Who was inside the federal government, who said that she hates white people, even though she's white, that whites should be genocided, and that she's one of the people that's part of this army that Michael Moore is creating, saying whistleblow.
[01:10:21.801 --> 01:10:24.543]  Well, whistleblowing is if you're exposing something illegal.
[01:10:28.208 --> 01:10:34.189]  Leaking national security information and you're leaking stuff mixed in with lies, it's totally illegal.
[01:10:34.650 --> 01:10:39.091]  But to have Michael Moore organizing it, saying it's to overthrow Trump is incredible.
[01:10:39.151 --> 01:10:45.992]  Accused leaker, last name Winner, called Trump an orange fascist on Twitter.
[01:10:46.252 --> 01:10:48.013]  That's CNN's whitewash.
[01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:50.091]  We actually read her website.
[01:10:50.431 --> 01:10:51.732]  Paul Watson wrote about it yesterday.
[01:10:52.152 --> 01:10:53.213]  And read her Facebook and stuff.
[01:10:53.233 --> 01:10:55.634]  She says white people need to all be genocided.
[01:10:56.014 --> 01:11:00.197]  This is the type of mental patient filling the federal government right now.
[01:11:00.657 --> 01:11:03.439]  And they're all saying leak, leak, leak, leak, leak.
[01:11:03.839 --> 01:11:06.341]  To the point of we can't even get intelligence on terror attacks.
[01:11:08.686 --> 01:11:15.370]  In England, because they leak it to sabotage Trump within minutes just to stop everything he does and bring the country down.
[01:11:15.930 --> 01:11:21.253]  Because they don't want to just bring Trump down, they want to bring him down because he wants to restore the Republic.
[01:11:22.335 --> 01:11:24.556]  The globalists want to run this country.
[01:11:24.597 --> 01:11:25.617]  They want to dominate it.
[01:11:26.258 --> 01:11:28.359]  What does the president need to do right now?
[01:11:28.419 --> 01:11:30.741]  Because his approval ratings are up, even in these skewed polls.
[01:11:31.201 --> 01:11:32.141]  He's turned the corner.
[01:11:32.782 --> 01:11:34.083]  He's delivering on the economy.
[01:11:34.483 --> 01:11:36.504]  You can feel the momentum shifting towards Trump.
[01:11:36.845 --> 01:11:41.308]  A lot of experts agree with me, but that's only making the deep state become more desperate.
[01:11:41.328 --> 01:11:42.248]  Is that what you're saying, Corsi?
[01:11:43.249 --> 01:11:48.292]  They're getting more desperate and getting more determined to write the articles of impeachment right now.
[01:11:48.352 --> 01:11:49.453]  This is what this is about.
[01:11:50.123 --> 01:11:53.544]  That's what's hoped to be achieved tomorrow with James Comey's testimony.
[01:11:53.564 --> 01:11:55.185]  This is serious.
[01:11:55.325 --> 01:11:57.106]  Trump's got to act fairly quickly.
[01:11:57.886 --> 01:12:01.628]  And he's got to clean out the White House, starting with Priebus.
[01:12:02.108 --> 01:12:03.669]  He's got to start exerting power.
[01:12:03.689 --> 01:12:10.351]  He's got to start acting as a strong president, a Lyndon Johnson-type strong president.
[01:12:10.371 --> 01:12:11.812]  I'm not saying we need a Vietnam.
[01:12:11.852 --> 01:12:13.072]  I'm not advocating a war.
[01:12:13.553 --> 01:12:19.515]  I'm advocating the use of the executive office in a way that Washington will respect.
[01:12:20.166 --> 01:12:22.348]  Right now, Washington thinks they can walk all over Trump.
[01:12:22.968 --> 01:12:25.971]  They think he's a minor actor.
[01:12:26.011 --> 01:12:28.833]  They think he's completely out of his league.
[01:12:29.614 --> 01:12:31.155]  I've known Donald Trump for a long time.
[01:12:31.175 --> 01:12:32.336]  He's a very quick learner.
[01:12:32.977 --> 01:12:35.519]  But he always gets behind the curve like this.
[01:12:35.599 --> 01:12:38.441]  He always looks like he's going to lose right up until he wins.
[01:12:39.858 --> 01:12:55.751]  You know, instead of having in the front row of that press office with an anti-Trump act-up hour every day, they ought to close that press room, they ought to get Infowars in there full-time, and others like Infowars that helped elect Trump.
[01:12:55.811 --> 01:13:02.397]  If he doesn't realize who his friends are right now, Donald Trump, and I mean this in as cold seriousness as I can say,
[01:13:03.814 --> 01:13:07.997]  If the deep state doesn't find a way to assassinate him, they'll find a way to impeach him.
[01:13:08.557 --> 01:13:11.239]  And that's what's at stake right now.
[01:13:15.273 --> 01:13:27.377]  If you're looking at Trump, you see at the State Department, he orders them under law to stop bringing in people from seven countries that have total failed states where the Imams issue the passports because you are a terrorist.
[01:13:27.397 --> 01:13:30.118]  You know, they give you a passport and then we let them in unvetted.
[01:13:30.158 --> 01:13:31.318]  This is completely insane.
[01:13:31.659 --> 01:13:32.759]  The courts are blocking him.
[01:13:33.099 --> 01:13:35.900]  The State Department's blocking him, as you have reported here.
[01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:37.981]  He is complaining about that himself.
[01:13:38.501 --> 01:13:39.221]  What does he do?
[01:13:39.401 --> 01:13:41.022]  I have a crew of like 70 people.
[01:13:41.062 --> 01:13:44.523]  They're great folks, but I can't seem to get a lot of stuff done sometimes.
[01:13:45.762 --> 01:13:47.583]  With a crew that is really smart and means well.
[01:13:48.064 --> 01:13:52.547]  I mean, how does he do this with such a servile, weak group of people in D.C.
[01:13:52.587 --> 01:14:02.173]  from both parties that are all not going to show up to work tomorrow and get drunk and watch, you know, the Comey hearings with the happy hour bars opening at 8 a.m.?
[01:14:03.594 --> 01:14:04.534]  The only way D.C.
[01:14:04.575 --> 01:14:05.855]  works is that they're afraid of you.
[01:14:06.616 --> 01:14:09.638]  He's got to take control of the R.N.C., he's got to get control of the money.
[01:14:10.342 --> 01:14:16.427]  He's got to make it clear to Ryan, Ryan's no longer in charge of handing out who gets the money to be reelected.
[01:14:17.327 --> 01:14:22.932]  Trump's got to start enforcing party discipline from the White House, same way Lyndon Johnson did.
[01:14:22.952 --> 01:14:25.934]  He's got to start using the telephone, calling up people.
[01:14:27.135 --> 01:14:31.218]  The State Department, any of these agencies, fire them by half.
[01:14:31.758 --> 01:14:32.419]  Get rid of people.
[01:14:32.459 --> 01:14:36.802]  Get rid of anybody who's got a resume or pedigree from Obama or Clinton.
[01:14:37.082 --> 01:14:37.943]  Get them out of the White House.
[01:14:38.912 --> 01:14:45.975]  If Trump doesn't have loyalists around him, if he doesn't have people who are going to fight for him, he's going to lose the presidency.
[01:14:46.635 --> 01:14:52.917]  And as much as I'm for Trump, this is the strongest warning I've ever issued because I've never seen it.
[01:14:53.217 --> 01:14:57.039]  They're going to start writing articles of impeachment based on a lie.
[01:14:57.059 --> 01:15:02.541]  They're going to try to ram it through with the mainstream media that Trump is inviting into the White House every day.
[01:15:03.303 --> 01:15:13.000]  Or an hour televised and sit in that front row of that stupid little room and argue that Trump doesn't know what he's doing to create some new story out of a gotcha question.
[01:15:13.664 --> 01:15:15.385]  And it's disgraceful and it's got to stop.
[01:15:15.945 --> 01:15:19.848]  Trump has the ability to stop it, get rid of Priebus, immediately.
[01:15:20.048 --> 01:15:23.730]  Priebus is, you don't have a strong chief of staff who's fighting for you.
[01:15:24.290 --> 01:15:27.052]  Priebus' meal ticket is Ryan and the GOP.
[01:15:27.152 --> 01:15:27.592]  That's right.
[01:15:27.632 --> 01:15:35.737]  In America, you see the racial division, you see the balkanization, you see the poverty, you see what the globalists want here and abroad.
[01:15:36.297 --> 01:15:37.478]  This is so important.
[01:15:38.263 --> 01:15:45.765]  If you claim you want a second American Revolution to support Trump and to back him, because they've got all these conservative talk show hosts kind of riding the fence here.
[01:15:46.325 --> 01:15:49.826]  And we're going to lose everything if people keep riding the fence.
[01:15:49.866 --> 01:15:52.926]  Dr. Corsi, powerful articles on Infowars.com.
[01:15:53.427 --> 01:15:54.247]  Thank you so much.
[01:15:54.607 --> 01:16:00.108]  We're about to go to Michael Snyder, and I have some huge breaking news that I'm going to go to here in just a moment.
[01:16:00.448 --> 01:16:02.189]  Huge breaking news here in just a few minutes.
[01:16:02.589 --> 01:16:06.870]  Michael Snyder is now going to ride shotgun with us for the balance of the hour.
[01:16:08.010 --> 01:16:11.233]  Obviously an excellent writer, researcher, educator, author.
[01:16:11.533 --> 01:16:14.496]  He's talking about running for Congress out in the state of Utah.
[01:16:14.536 --> 01:16:15.336]  Very exciting there.
[01:16:15.356 --> 01:16:16.757]  Because that's the real revolution.
[01:16:17.158 --> 01:16:22.122]  Trump's just a frontline battering ram and God-loving.
[01:16:23.763 --> 01:16:31.410]  But all of us running for mayor, running for dog catcher, running for school board, running for state legislature, you know, getting involved.
[01:16:31.470 --> 01:16:33.231]  This is how we're going to change the world.
[01:16:35.413 --> 01:16:36.294]  So important.
[01:16:37.250 --> 01:16:39.032]  So we're going to look at all this right now.
[01:16:39.332 --> 01:16:41.614]  Michael Snyder, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:16:42.234 --> 01:16:43.355]  What do you want to tackle first?
[01:16:43.395 --> 01:16:44.897]  The big hearings coming up tomorrow?
[01:16:45.277 --> 01:16:46.318]  The State of the Union?
[01:16:46.979 --> 01:16:49.281]  The huge Ramadan attacks happening everywhere on the left?
[01:16:49.761 --> 01:16:50.862]  Trying to make excuses for it?
[01:16:50.902 --> 01:16:51.523]  I mean, it's just...
[01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:58.734]  Hard to believe how villainous they are, but also, let's be frank, how weak and passive we are.
[01:16:59.074 --> 01:17:02.917]  Because most libertarian or conservative men, they say, oh, thanks for what you're doing.
[01:17:02.937 --> 01:17:03.797]  Well, I appreciate them.
[01:17:03.817 --> 01:17:04.758]  At least they're awake and care.
[01:17:05.158 --> 01:17:09.901]  But don't they understand they've got to be involved, they've got to be doing stuff every day in this fight.
[01:17:10.161 --> 01:17:18.287]  We have serious, hardcore totalitarianism with a whole communist slash satanic
[01:17:20.146 --> 01:17:21.893]  Undertone taking over.
[01:17:21.934 --> 01:17:24.022]  We have true evil facing us.
[01:17:25.751 --> 01:17:29.574]  We do, Alex, and it's a global system that wants to destroy us.
[01:17:29.794 --> 01:17:36.579]  While we engage the other side and we believe they should have freedom of speech, they want to take our freedom of speech completely away.
[01:17:36.619 --> 01:17:37.499]  They want to shut us up.
[01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:40.021]  They want to say what you're doing is hate speech.
[01:17:40.061 --> 01:17:41.682]  They want to say what I'm doing is hate speech.
[01:17:41.942 --> 01:17:50.989]  They want to criminalize what we're doing, shut us up, make us go away, and eventually the hardcore among them want to do kind of what Kathy Griffin did when she held up that bloody head of Trump.
[01:17:51.309 --> 01:17:56.733]  They literally, some of the most hardcore, if they got their way, that they would kill us.
[01:17:57.153 --> 01:18:04.118]  But, you know, the less hardcore among them just want to shut us up, criminalize us and throw us in prison, basically eliminate us.
[01:18:04.278 --> 01:18:07.521]  We want to defeat the other side because we believe in freedom of speech.
[01:18:07.561 --> 01:18:08.521]  We believe in the U.S.
[01:18:08.581 --> 01:18:09.322]  Constitution.
[01:18:09.642 --> 01:18:10.163]  And that's why
[01:18:27.861 --> 01:18:36.148]  Strong Cities doesn't make sense to have the UN here lecturing us, saying federalize, globalize our police, bullying cops, funding people to go out and randomly kill cops.
[01:18:36.409 --> 01:18:37.470]  They think the cops are weak.
[01:18:37.770 --> 01:18:39.051]  They think the cop unions are weak.
[01:18:39.271 --> 01:18:39.952]  They think we're weak.
[01:18:39.972 --> 01:18:40.993]  They think the American people are weak.
[01:18:41.173 --> 01:18:46.137]  They think they're going to roll over to this globalist policing and be their enforcers if they kill enough of them.
[01:18:46.417 --> 01:18:48.039]  And I'm going to ask the cops something right now.
[01:18:49.164 --> 01:18:51.286]  What are you doing to stand up against this, okay?
[01:18:51.326 --> 01:18:56.269]  I know you don't have all the power in the world, but every man and woman out there, we know the score now, people.
[01:18:56.289 --> 01:18:57.370]  There's no more excuses.
[01:18:57.711 --> 01:18:59.372]  This country is under total attack.
[01:18:59.392 --> 01:18:59.952]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:19:01.353 --> 01:19:01.894]  Oh, it's true.
[01:19:01.954 --> 01:19:10.860]  We need to understand, yeah, we've gotten Donald Trump into the White House, but this liberal world order, and that's, this is a term that's starting to be used by the Washington Post.
[01:19:10.941 --> 01:19:15.144]  It was used by Joe Biden in his final speech at the World Economic Forum.
[01:19:15.404 --> 01:19:17.826]  But this liberal world order, this new world order,
[01:19:18.346 --> 01:19:24.410]  You know, Donald Trump may control the White House, but everything else in Washington pretty much is still dominated by them.
[01:19:24.670 --> 01:19:34.915]  They dominate the mainstream media, they dominate the court system, and that's one of their most powerful tools where they get their agenda implemented because they dominate the legal system in this country.
[01:19:36.937 --> 01:19:43.221]  They don't produce economies of scale, economies of ideas, economies of products and innovation.
[01:19:43.641 --> 01:19:54.229]  Socialism, collectivism always begins to create masses of people that specialize in scamming, specialize in taking things over, specialize in making people pay kickbacks.
[01:19:54.569 --> 01:20:04.216]  And we're becoming Mexico, we're becoming Eastern Europe, we're becoming those corrupt systems that no matter how rich the culture, no matter how many resources they have,
[01:20:04.776 --> 01:20:08.257]  It creates a giant mass of poor people by design.
[01:20:08.637 --> 01:20:09.858]  This is the globalist model.
[01:20:10.218 --> 01:20:13.699]  And it's why they hate Trump declaring TPP a fraud.
[01:20:13.739 --> 01:20:16.360]  Declaring the carbon tax a system to make us poor.
[01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:17.480]  Because it is.
[01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:18.460]  It is.
[01:20:18.981 --> 01:20:23.082]  And it's so incredible to realize we're to this point, Michael.
[01:20:24.565 --> 01:20:29.887]  Yeah, and this is why control freaks are drawn to the system like moss to a flame.
[01:20:30.067 --> 01:20:32.548]  And particularly, they love to go to law school.
[01:20:32.568 --> 01:20:37.909]  Law school I've called Seminary for Liberals, because it's kind of their religion.
[01:20:39.610 --> 01:20:46.532]  For example, I went to law school down at the University of Florida, and you would think that Florida, you know, northern Florida, kind of conservative, but no.
[01:20:47.192 --> 01:20:50.894]  The student body was extremely liberal, but even more liberal was the professors.
[01:20:50.974 --> 01:20:59.059]  In fact, among all the dozens of professors that taught at the school, there was only one Republican, but there were all kinds of lesbians and radical leftists.
[01:20:59.139 --> 01:21:00.540]  And this was the University of Florida.
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:01.981]  This wasn't the Ivy League.
[01:21:02.361 --> 01:21:04.482]  But this is what our legal system has become.
[01:21:04.522 --> 01:21:10.105]  They also dominate the system of education, from all the way from kindergarten all the way up through our university system.
[01:21:10.125 --> 01:21:10.986]  Let's be clear.
[01:21:11.006 --> 01:21:11.486]  It's an elite.
[01:21:11.826 --> 01:21:12.446]  It's an elite.
[01:21:12.667 --> 01:21:14.348]  And then they pick the broken strategy.
[01:21:15.288 --> 01:21:24.891]  Broken coalition strategy of all these subgroups that they then rule over a sexual preference or over this or over that and then they just rule those groups in their little fiefdoms.
[01:21:25.171 --> 01:21:26.511]  This is pure social engineering.
[01:21:26.531 --> 01:21:28.892]  This just broke on Infowars.com.
[01:21:28.932 --> 01:21:29.972]  It broke in the last 10 minutes.
[01:21:30.673 --> 01:21:31.833]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:32.313 --> 01:21:34.474]  This is from the Associated Press.
[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:39.141]  Congressman starts impeachment process against President Trump.
[01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:47.763]  Representative Al Green, a Texas Democrat who said he would do this previously, said he's writing articles of impeachment against Donald Trump, the first official step to remove a sitting president.
[01:21:48.423 --> 01:21:53.484]  So it's just like Bob Barr kicked it off in Georgia against Bill Clinton, this is now being kicked off in Texas.
[01:21:53.544 --> 01:21:54.244]  Truly shameful.
[01:21:54.684 --> 01:22:02.666]  Green took to the House floor last month to call for the impeachment of the President for what he said was obstruction of justice in connection to the firing of FBI James Comey.
[01:22:03.226 --> 01:22:05.006]  The facts are simple and indisputable.
[01:22:05.026 --> 01:22:07.467]  The facts are simple and indisputable.
[01:22:07.487 --> 01:22:08.907]  The facts are simple and indisputable.
[01:22:08.927 --> 01:22:10.947]  The facts are simple and indisputable.
[01:22:10.967 --> 01:22:13.548]  The facts are simple and indisputable.
[01:22:14.848 --> 01:22:16.088]  The facts are simple and indisputable.
[01:22:16.408 --> 01:22:17.789]  The facts are simple and indisputable.
[01:22:30.871 --> 01:22:35.934]  Because the director was investigating the president's presidential connections to Russia, interfered the presidential election.
[01:22:36.334 --> 01:22:38.916]  Green said in a statement, this is obstruction of justice.
[01:22:39.256 --> 01:22:43.938]  The articles are mostly symbolic and highly unlikely to go anywhere in the Republican-controlled House.
[01:22:43.978 --> 01:22:45.739]  Green has not yet officially introduced them.
[01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:49.882]  And then right after that came out, there's this headline, Top Dems Reject Impeachment Push.
[01:22:51.545 --> 01:22:56.687]  Adam Schiff, we have to find out what the facts are, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said.
[01:22:56.947 --> 01:22:58.248]  But still, they don't have the facts.
[01:22:58.628 --> 01:23:00.109]  This is all just a bunch of maneuvering.
[01:23:00.409 --> 01:23:02.590]  These people are truly transparent, Michael Snyder.
[01:23:03.832 --> 01:23:04.493]  Oh, it's true.
[01:23:04.833 --> 01:23:16.921]  And this is a nothing scandal because Alex, even if every single thing that Comey is claiming is true, even if every single thing that he's claiming is true, and that's a big if, then there's still no obstruction of justice.
[01:23:16.961 --> 01:23:20.823]  For example, you look at the main statute that governs obstruction of justice.
[01:23:20.863 --> 01:23:23.685]  That's 18 USC 1503.
[01:23:23.986 --> 01:23:28.028]  Now, there's certain elements that have to be proven in a case for obstruction of justice.
[01:23:28.549 --> 01:23:31.250]  One is that there has to be some sort of official proceeding.
[01:23:31.611 --> 01:23:33.652]  Now, in this case, there's not any of that.
[01:23:33.752 --> 01:23:33.952]  There's
[01:23:53.642 --> 01:23:54.023]  I think?
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:15.481]  Well sure, and let's look at how the media
[01:24:40.784 --> 01:24:46.586]  Look how the media is constantly leaking classified stuff, but it's okay when they do it.
[01:24:46.986 --> 01:24:52.908]  He's the president, but case by case point, he didn't leak where the submarines were in South Korea.
[01:24:53.328 --> 01:24:56.149]  He didn't leak information about laptop bombs and ISIS.
[01:24:56.469 --> 01:24:58.430]  That was known two months before and all over the news.
[01:24:58.470 --> 01:24:59.290]  This is ridiculous.
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:01.861]  Oh, it absolutely is.
[01:25:02.001 --> 01:25:07.966]  But what they want to do is they want to destroy Donald Trump, as Dr. Jerome Corsi was just talking about.
[01:25:08.327 --> 01:25:11.970]  And so Donald Trump, he's kind of a bull in a china shop, but he's walking through a minefield.
[01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:17.695]  Because I've explained on the program before, there's literally thousands of laws that could apply to the executive branch.
[01:25:18.075 --> 01:25:25.502]  And all these sharks are just waiting and watching him like a hawk to see if he'll step on one of these landmines so they can get him.
[01:25:25.902 --> 01:25:30.665]  And so right now, they're going to try to let this impeachment thing kind of go with a slow burn.
[01:25:31.045 --> 01:25:41.111]  But in terms of what the Democrats, what I'm hearing and what they're saying in their fundraising letters and among their rank and file is that right now, OK, they're going to let this thing go with kind of a slow burn.
[01:25:41.312 --> 01:25:48.156]  But they're really targeting 2018 because their plan is for there to be an anti-Trump backlash for them to take the House and the Senate.
[01:25:48.536 --> 01:25:51.558]  And then that'll be their golden opportunity to strike with impeachment.
[01:25:51.598 --> 01:25:53.059]  So they're going to let this thing build.
[01:25:53.439 --> 01:25:58.142]  And if they get some, you know, just a golden opportunity, you know, they'll go ahead right now.
[01:25:58.542 --> 01:26:06.907]  But if not, if they have to, they'll wait till 2018, let it kind of build up, and then they get their majorities in both houses of Congress, and then strike and try to take them out.
[01:26:07.227 --> 01:26:07.947]  That's right, Michael.
[01:26:07.987 --> 01:26:08.768]  And they also brag.
[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:13.141]  That bottom line, they paralyze his agenda.
[01:26:13.181 --> 01:26:14.561]  He never gets to meet with Putin.
[01:26:14.881 --> 01:26:17.602]  He never gets to take out radical Islam.
[01:26:17.622 --> 01:26:19.383]  They want to block that because they're allied with it.
[01:26:19.703 --> 01:26:27.005]  So bare minimum, they paralyze him, where if the ambassador from Russia or the foreign minister comes to the White House, look, he took him in a back room.
[01:26:27.045 --> 01:26:27.865]  Look, it's secret.
[01:26:28.305 --> 01:26:29.386]  Look, he's giving them secrets.
[01:26:29.426 --> 01:26:30.146]  He's a spy.
[01:26:30.766 --> 01:26:37.531]  Acting like the president can't go behind closed doors with the Russian ambassador, that's as normal as breathing when you're the president.
[01:26:37.751 --> 01:26:41.754]  That's what the president does, but again, they think the public's dumb, like Gruber said.
[01:26:42.694 --> 01:26:43.975]  Thank God they're so dumb.
[01:26:44.295 --> 01:26:45.795]  They don't know we're going to triple prices.
[01:26:46.135 --> 01:26:47.376]  Thank God they're so stupid.
[01:26:47.396 --> 01:26:48.296]  They're like goldfish.
[01:26:48.336 --> 01:26:49.116]  They're so pathetic.
[01:26:49.357 --> 01:26:50.037]  Ha ha ha.
[01:26:50.337 --> 01:26:51.597]  I got hired to lie to them.
[01:26:52.158 --> 01:26:56.019]  They're so proud of themselves because they're the filth.
[01:26:56.099 --> 01:26:56.859]  They're the scum.
[01:26:56.899 --> 01:26:57.900]  They're the non-producers.
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:06.743]  They're the elites that are selling out our wealth, killing the country, showing racial division, Michael Schneider, at levels I've never seen before.
[01:27:06.763 --> 01:27:10.525]  And I want to shift gears to that with you now because
[01:27:11.932 --> 01:27:17.195]  I look at the terror attacks in the United States, in Canada, in Australia, in Europe, in England.
[01:27:17.796 --> 01:27:19.037]  They don't even usually get reported.
[01:27:19.057 --> 01:27:28.623]  You'll see some report where woman stabbed in Toronto, woman stabbed in Chicago, man stabbed, and then later you learn in the court hearing Allah Akbar's yelled.
[01:27:28.703 --> 01:27:32.045]  I mean I'm seeing every day five or six articles
[01:27:33.206 --> 01:27:36.168]  Where later it comes out in court, it was an Islamic attack.
[01:27:36.668 --> 01:27:38.990]  And it is just the most cowardly garbage.
[01:27:39.150 --> 01:27:39.831]  Look at these headlines.
[01:27:40.331 --> 01:27:42.433]  Ramadan terrorist death toll hits 180.
[01:27:45.855 --> 01:27:51.539]  Third of London Bridge attackers reportedly told authorities, I'm going to be a terrorist and we're allowed to stay in the country and travel in and out.
[01:27:51.579 --> 01:27:55.462]  I mean, folks, they keep you out of England if you come in, you know, flying and say you're there on business.
[01:27:56.892 --> 01:28:03.345]  Fatalities and injuries after shootings, bombings in Iranian Parliament and Khomeini Shrine.
[01:28:03.986 --> 01:28:07.513]  Woman screamed Allah Akbar, charged in Toronto store attacks.
[01:28:07.734 --> 01:28:08.595]  That's Toronto Sun.
[01:28:10.101 --> 01:28:14.542]  UN Report 163 civilians executed by Islamic State in Mosul alone.
[01:28:14.882 --> 01:28:15.642]  CNS News.
[01:28:16.462 --> 01:28:21.203]  Notre Dame terrorist was given an award by EU for complaining about racism against migrants.
[01:28:21.563 --> 01:28:22.324]  That's right, an award.
[01:28:22.704 --> 01:28:23.444]  But wait, it gets better.
[01:28:23.824 --> 01:28:31.506]  Schools in lockdown after female nursery worker on her way to work is pulled to the ground and slashed in the arm by three girls shouting Allah Akbar.
[01:28:31.926 --> 01:28:33.366]  Shouting Allah is going to get you.
[01:28:35.245 --> 01:28:35.685]  Germany.
[01:28:35.705 --> 01:28:38.388]  This is a big report by the Gatestone Institute.
[01:28:38.748 --> 01:28:40.410]  Drudge linked to the last time we posted one of these.
[01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:40.990]  It's powerful.
[01:28:41.410 --> 01:28:41.911]  Germany.
[01:28:42.371 --> 01:28:44.273]  Surge in stabbings and knife crimes.
[01:28:44.293 --> 01:28:46.114]  Of course, screaming Allah Akbar.
[01:28:47.065 --> 01:28:47.645]  Continuing.
[01:28:48.266 --> 01:28:49.906]  But see, you can't say that in Germany.
[01:28:50.027 --> 01:28:52.948]  You have to say Serge and Stabbings or they'll arrest you for saying it's Muslims.
[01:28:53.108 --> 01:28:53.608]  I'm not kidding.
[01:28:55.069 --> 01:28:55.509]  Here's the key one.
[01:28:55.529 --> 01:28:57.110]  I want to come back and hit.
[01:28:57.910 --> 01:29:03.813]  Swedish government orders clinic to end treatment for rape victims in favor of treating migrants.
[01:29:04.354 --> 01:29:08.936]  Paul Joseph Watson, but it links to SVT reports and mainstream news.
[01:29:09.256 --> 01:29:12.278]  With a straight face, they say rape isn't an issue.
[01:29:13.191 --> 01:29:15.554]  That's not hurting our Stockholm Syndrome women.
[01:29:16.195 --> 01:29:17.838]  No, it's the poor little Muslims.
[01:29:18.318 --> 01:29:19.640]  They've been through too much.
[01:29:20.241 --> 01:29:22.724]  So we need to give them all the treatment for taxpayers.
[01:29:23.105 --> 01:29:26.690]  Just like, let's throw old people out in Sweden, in Italy, in Germany.
[01:29:27.959 --> 01:29:30.541]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:30.601 --> 01:29:31.602]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.867 --> 01:30:05.452]  Does your shampoo leave your scalp itchy and your hair dry and frizzy?

[01:31:50.009 --> 01:31:58.296]  Well, I gotta tell you, Millie Weaver and her great accomplice in patriotic crime against the New World Order, Gavin, aren't just amazing researchers and reporters.
[01:31:58.757 --> 01:32:01.439]  They're also really, really good at shooting commercials.
[01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:11.048]  I mean, that thing looks like some million-dollar Hollywood commercial, and they shot that right here in Austin, Texas, to support the broadcast, without me even asking them to do it.
[01:32:11.508 --> 01:32:17.591]  And that's because Millie is really into high quality organic shampoo, body wash, things like that.
[01:32:18.091 --> 01:32:20.933]  And she tried Emmerich's Essentials and just thought that it was amazing.
[01:32:21.233 --> 01:32:24.234]  So she had the idea with Gavin to produce the ad you just saw.
[01:32:24.294 --> 01:32:28.276]  But believe me, the product is just as good as the cover.
[01:32:28.736 --> 01:32:33.839]  You'll find Emmerich's Essentials at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:40.301]  And again, I'd like to thank the listeners and the viewers for their ongoing support.
[01:32:40.541 --> 01:32:42.042]  Without you, there would be no InfoWar.
[01:32:42.402 --> 01:32:45.283]  And I'd like to thank Millie and Gavin for really going the extra mile.
[01:32:45.303 --> 01:32:48.864]  I think this is one of the best commercials I've ever seen, and I'm really proud that it's ours.
[01:32:49.524 --> 01:32:54.685]  So again, folks, find out why Emerge Essentials has so many people really giving it five-star reviews.
[01:32:54.806 --> 01:32:59.147]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[01:33:01.946 --> 01:33:06.990]  Who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:15.816]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[01:33:15.956 --> 01:33:27.303]  The Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign to influence voters in the election.
[01:33:27.424 --> 01:33:28.965]  And then they began to weaponize them.
[01:33:29.745 --> 01:33:45.636]  And they began to have some of their allies within the internet world, like InfoWars, take out pieces and began to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[01:33:45.696 --> 01:33:47.957]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[01:33:48.418 --> 01:33:54.802]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, your reputation is amazing, I will not let you down.
[01:33:57.495 --> 01:33:59.579]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:05.270]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:34:10.914 --> 01:34:11.515]  Hi, Chelsea.
[01:34:11.815 --> 01:34:12.056]  Hi.
[01:34:12.136 --> 01:34:12.617]  How are you?
[01:34:12.757 --> 01:34:12.897]  Good.
[01:34:12.957 --> 01:34:13.297]  How are you?
[01:34:13.337 --> 01:34:13.578]  Good.
[01:34:13.658 --> 01:34:18.865]  Because this book's for everyone, including women who have wanted to speak up but have been told to quiet down.
[01:34:19.045 --> 01:34:20.887]  Can you sign it for my friend Juanita Broderick?
[01:34:20.927 --> 01:34:24.933]  Because she's been silenced by your parents, especially Bill Clinton, who's a rapist.
[01:34:25.193 --> 01:34:25.814]  Can you sign it for her?
[01:34:25.834 --> 01:34:26.695]  Thank you for coming today.
[01:34:26.855 --> 01:34:27.496]  Can you sign it?
[01:34:28.677 --> 01:34:28.878]  Thanks.
[01:34:31.124 --> 01:34:31.804]  Hey, Sean, how are you?
[01:34:31.824 --> 01:34:35.605]  Don't you wish you went to Washington so you could be dealing with this every second of every day?
[01:34:35.665 --> 01:34:37.666]  You know what, I've never seen hatred like this.
[01:34:37.766 --> 01:34:39.326]  I mean, to me, they're not even people.
[01:34:39.566 --> 01:34:40.806]  It's so, so sad.
[01:34:40.826 --> 01:34:42.607]  I mean, morality's just gone.
[01:34:43.647 --> 01:34:45.008]  Morals have flown out the window.
[01:34:45.108 --> 01:34:47.028]  We deserve so much better than this as a country.
[01:34:47.048 --> 01:34:47.408]  You're right.
[01:34:47.848 --> 01:34:48.448]  You know, it's so sad.
[01:34:48.488 --> 01:34:49.509]  You see the Democratic Party.
[01:34:49.569 --> 01:34:50.109]  They're imploding.
[01:34:50.449 --> 01:34:50.969]  They're imploding.
[01:34:50.989 --> 01:34:51.749]  They have no message.
[01:34:52.109 --> 01:34:54.030]  You see the head of the DNC, who was a total
[01:34:54.730 --> 01:34:56.411]  Eric, I gotta tell you something.
[01:35:21.940 --> 01:35:28.182]  So there you go, Sean Hannity last night, one of the only good, decent TV shows left there to basically break down what's happening in the news.
[01:35:29.122 --> 01:35:31.423]  We see the ongoing takedown of Fox News.
[01:35:32.143 --> 01:35:34.124]  And then it's going to be the rest of the alternative media.
[01:35:35.584 --> 01:35:40.165]  And they admit that they want to shut us all down, like they're doing in Europe.
[01:35:41.206 --> 01:35:44.727]  But there's got to be some end to the level that people will put up with.
[01:35:45.367 --> 01:35:48.668]  Just like I read earlier, and I want to open the phones up and take your calls with Michael Snyder.
[01:35:50.179 --> 01:35:57.724]  Just like I read the headline earlier, Swedish government orders clinic to end treatment for rape victims in favor of treating migrants.
[01:35:59.405 --> 01:36:08.771]  The Swedish government has announced that a clinic in Stockholm will no longer treat female rape victims and the money will be spent on treating traumatized Muslim migrants instead.
[01:36:10.452 --> 01:36:15.195]  Yesterday I reported how they're telling the women go out and have sex with the migrants to make them feel welcome.
[01:36:16.863 --> 01:36:25.448]  After 10 years of helping rape victims, the Stockholm Crisis and Trauma Center will now only devote itself to patients with war and torture trauma.
[01:36:25.968 --> 01:36:35.574]  These are mainly the soldiers of ISIS, now as refugees, 80% military age men coming in and getting the treatment.
[01:36:36.094 --> 01:36:42.158]  Authorities in Stockholm, notice it's Stockholm, Sweden, Stockholm Syndrome, where you worship your abusers and serve them.
[01:36:42.598 --> 01:36:43.499]  Authorities in Stockholm
[01:36:44.633 --> 01:36:46.854]  According to Maria Hagerstrand, Unit Manager of Psychiatry in Stockholms County,
[01:37:12.148 --> 01:37:21.451]  Council, this is a group that is now expanding with the major migration flows that exist, and we want them to be able to help even more of that group in the future.
[01:37:23.452 --> 01:37:28.294]  The clinic helps around 200 rape victims annually, with around 140 of these being women.
[01:37:28.894 --> 01:37:32.075]  All of them will now have to find somewhere else to receive support.
[01:37:32.355 --> 01:37:33.716]  And it's like this every day.
[01:37:33.776 --> 01:37:35.596]  It's a total pattern.
[01:37:35.996 --> 01:37:37.757]  Tommy Morrison shot video last week.
[01:37:37.797 --> 01:37:38.337]  We aired it here.
[01:37:38.357 --> 01:37:40.298]  There's new video today.
[01:37:42.463 --> 01:37:43.003]  A Robinson.
[01:37:43.643 --> 01:37:44.383]  Tommy Robinson.
[01:37:45.784 --> 01:37:46.844]  Teleprompter free, folks.
[01:37:47.704 --> 01:37:51.965]  And it shows this really fancy house.
[01:37:55.106 --> 01:37:57.107]  And it's got surveillance and a cop car out front it.
[01:37:57.867 --> 01:38:02.808]  And each of the thousands that admit they're with ISIS and want to do terror, they're allowed to stay.
[01:38:04.124 --> 01:38:12.349]  Even though they're not British citizens, and they're allowed to just sit there and wear nightgowns and walk around with their giant beards and do nothing all day and lecture everyone arrogantly.
[01:38:12.369 --> 01:38:13.430]  It's a total mental illness.
[01:38:14.751 --> 01:38:19.554]  And then he's right next door to an elementary school.
[01:38:19.954 --> 01:38:21.475]  His back fence backs up to it.
[01:38:22.756 --> 01:38:26.398]  And I've got articles here of people getting stabbed all over the place.
[01:38:29.517 --> 01:38:41.125]  And then you've got the leftists saying that if the Socialists doesn't win and defeat May in England, in the UK this weekend, supporters threaten violence if Labour doesn't win the election.
[01:38:41.805 --> 01:38:46.408]  So I want to go over all this with Michael Snyder and take your phone calls and hit other issues that are on his front burner.
[01:38:46.808 --> 01:38:47.889]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:38:47.909 --> 01:38:49.490]  800-259-9231 on any of these specific issues.
[01:38:49.510 --> 01:38:50.671]  The open coup to overthrow Trump.
[01:38:58.598 --> 01:39:01.199]  Remember six months ago I told you about that and it sounded kind of far-fetched?
[01:39:01.239 --> 01:39:01.660]  Now it's here.
[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:02.960]  These people mean business.
[01:39:04.841 --> 01:39:06.662]  This is a struggle to regain the country and the world.
[01:39:07.102 --> 01:39:07.743]  We're fighting hard.
[01:39:07.783 --> 01:39:08.263]  This is real.
[01:39:08.463 --> 01:39:09.404]  You're in the middle of history.
[01:39:11.084 --> 01:39:12.785]  They're openly trying to destroy our First Amendment.
[01:39:12.805 --> 01:39:15.187]  They're openly trying to take over the internet freedom.
[01:39:16.667 --> 01:39:17.408]  It's all happening.
[01:39:17.488 --> 01:39:25.112]  But the good news is if we just keep speaking out and keep saying no and keep realizing that big national
[01:39:26.542 --> 01:39:28.943]  Special reports and memes being pushed.
[01:39:29.003 --> 01:39:30.424]  A lot of stuff in mainstream news is true.
[01:39:30.924 --> 01:39:31.705]  Gotta learn how to vet it.
[01:39:31.865 --> 01:39:32.245]  Go through it.
[01:39:32.285 --> 01:39:37.487]  But when there's big official stories like, there's no wiretapping of the White House, and then they admit they were.
[01:39:37.988 --> 01:39:40.449]  Or, there's no such thing as Islamic terror.
[01:39:40.489 --> 01:39:40.909]  Remember that?
[01:39:40.969 --> 01:39:41.830]  Don't use that term.
[01:39:42.570 --> 01:39:44.251]  See how fast that narrative collapsed?
[01:39:44.531 --> 01:39:46.332]  But for eight years Obama said that.
[01:39:47.232 --> 01:39:48.553]  And the media followed his orders.
[01:39:49.963 --> 01:39:54.665]  So just call this baloney, this garbage, this BS for what it is.
[01:39:54.985 --> 01:39:56.326]  Just say no to the peer pressure.
[01:39:56.726 --> 01:40:00.007]  Because all you have to lose is being a slave.
[01:40:00.328 --> 01:40:02.048]  You go along with this, it's over.
[01:40:02.108 --> 01:40:08.151]  And I know most of you know that, but all of us have to be loving about it, but more aggressive.
[01:40:10.072 --> 01:40:12.253]  Now briefly, we'll go back to Michael Snyder, 800-259-9231.
[01:40:15.472 --> 01:40:27.124]  We have our best-selling fluoride-free, organic, made-in-America toothpaste, made by the biggest manufacturer of fluoride-free toothpaste, private label for us, but proprietary at their factory, here in America.
[01:40:27.344 --> 01:40:31.369]  Iodine and colloidal silvers added, full of tea tree, peppermint, you name it.
[01:40:31.429 --> 01:40:32.530]  It's very concentrated.
[01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:33.811]  It's really, I'd call it 2 to 1.
[01:40:33.891 --> 01:40:35.373]  I mean, it's very strong.
[01:40:36.294 --> 01:40:36.834]  People love it.
[01:40:38.817 --> 01:40:40.238]  It's our overall total bestseller.
[01:40:40.278 --> 01:40:44.380]  We don't make a lot of money on it, obviously, because it's a low-ticket item, but it helps fund the operation.
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:50.204]  It's got nano-silver, iodine, peppermint oil, xylitol, and so much more.
[01:40:50.224 --> 01:40:51.565]  It's also got the tea tree oil.
[01:40:52.305 --> 01:40:55.567]  It is available at InfoWarsLife.com or AAA2533139.
[01:40:55.607 --> 01:40:56.167]  And Super Blue,
[01:40:59.810 --> 01:41:00.951]  Has been sold out for months.
[01:41:01.171 --> 01:41:06.755]  It is now back in the bubble gum for children that doesn't have the peppermint in it because it's not as strong.
[01:41:07.115 --> 01:41:07.695]  It is sold out.
[01:41:07.735 --> 01:41:11.238]  Unfortunately, we're really trying to figure out our supply lines and things and get all this done.
[01:41:11.258 --> 01:41:16.921]  But when it's organic, when it's the best source products, when it's all going to be tested, California standard, it's very hard to get the raw material.
[01:41:17.242 --> 01:41:18.963]  So that's why we are sold out so often.
[01:41:20.804 --> 01:41:21.925]  And so we're really working on that.
[01:41:21.945 --> 01:41:23.546]  But thank you all for your financial support.
[01:41:23.806 --> 01:41:24.927]  This is really great toothpaste.
[01:41:25.287 --> 01:41:26.508]  Super blue back in stock.
[01:41:27.248 --> 01:41:28.449]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:41:28.549 --> 01:41:29.450]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:41:30.816 --> 01:41:32.218]  Or 888-253-3139.
[01:41:32.558 --> 01:41:46.236]  And on top of that, we have back in stock the highest quality, bio-true selenium from organic mustard seed at an incredibly low price already.
[01:41:47.486 --> 01:41:50.909]  Normally $24.95 in a nice glass bottle full of capsules.
[01:41:51.550 --> 01:41:52.111]  It's only $14.96.
[01:41:52.311 --> 01:41:54.793]  You cannot beat that.
[01:41:55.314 --> 01:41:56.895]  Similar stuff at Whole Foods is like $40.
[01:41:57.976 --> 01:42:06.224]  But because we can get this inexpensively through our source, we're doing it to introduce you to the amount of energy, the stamina, the research.
[01:42:06.244 --> 01:42:08.667]  The big missing link is selenium deficiencies.
[01:42:09.327 --> 01:42:10.228]  You tie it together with the X2.
[01:42:11.309 --> 01:42:11.889]  They should eye it out.
[01:42:11.929 --> 01:42:12.569]  It's amazing.
[01:42:12.689 --> 01:42:16.690]  Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:42:16.730 --> 01:42:19.991]  And I'm just hoping and praying the funding comes in, but we're expanding.
[01:42:20.211 --> 01:42:21.111]  We're hiring more people.
[01:42:21.351 --> 01:42:28.732]  We're getting more editors, more researchers, more investigative journalists, more crew to switch and run the live shows, because I'm all in.
[01:42:29.272 --> 01:42:31.352]  I'm not backing down from the globalist and all their attacks.
[01:42:31.773 --> 01:42:36.413]  Now, going to Michael Snyder, who's got several top-viewed news websites out there.
[01:42:36.953 --> 01:42:38.934]  Everybody should visit the EconomicCollapseBlog.com.
[01:42:40.194 --> 01:42:43.976]  And of course, he has several others that everybody should also visit.
[01:42:45.676 --> 01:42:48.678]  Where is this entire Islamist thing going?
[01:42:50.518 --> 01:42:52.759]  Do you think people are really starting to get fed up with it?
[01:42:52.779 --> 01:42:53.740]  I mean, we're seeing that.
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:55.400]  And where does it go?
[01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:59.942]  I mean, is the desperation of the globalists and the left a sign that they're about to collapse?
[01:43:00.582 --> 01:43:09.006]  Or do they just get more frantic and more frantic and more frantic, and through mass Stockholm Syndrome, everybody just submits to the little toddlers throwing fits?
[01:43:10.526 --> 01:43:14.067]  Yeah, well, on the left, you see, they're so politically correct, they're paralyzed.
[01:43:14.107 --> 01:43:18.428]  They don't even understand that radical Islam has declared war on us.
[01:43:18.588 --> 01:43:21.429]  Their worldview, they want to destroy us.
[01:43:21.469 --> 01:43:24.630]  Their intent is world domination.
[01:43:24.710 --> 01:43:27.010]  But you never see the left criticizing them.
[01:43:27.310 --> 01:43:30.391]  But, Alex, we're seeing terror attacks.
[01:43:30.411 --> 01:43:32.832]  2015, all-time record high for Islamic terror attacks.
[01:43:33.132 --> 01:43:35.074]  Then 2016, we shattered that record.
[01:43:35.094 --> 01:43:36.775]  We're on pace to shatter that record again.
[01:43:37.136 --> 01:43:44.082]  Where we're seeing it is day after day, you know, they're coming in so fast now we can barely keep up with all the Islamic terror attacks all over the world.
[01:43:44.102 --> 01:43:44.943]  You look at Sweden.
[01:43:45.363 --> 01:43:51.409]  I had ancestors that actually came from Sweden, settled in Minnesota, so I have roots going back to Sweden.
[01:43:51.429 --> 01:43:55.333]  And at one time, Sweden had one of the lowest crime rates on the entire planet.
[01:43:55.513 --> 01:43:57.715]  Very peaceful, just a lovely country.
[01:43:58.115 --> 01:44:11.468]  But now that's been totally turned upside down, not because of the indigenous population that's been there for centuries, but it's all because of the refugees that have been brought in, the Islamic immigration.
[01:44:11.488 --> 01:44:16.933]  And there's some cities in Sweden now you simply do not want to go to because they're so dangerous.
[01:44:18.073 --> 01:44:23.295]  But, and yet still they're so paralyzed by their political correctness, they're not doing anything about it.
[01:44:23.675 --> 01:44:30.177]  And that's why with Donald Trump, he wants to, he's calling it a travel ban, but you know, we want to know who's coming in.
[01:44:30.217 --> 01:44:40.120]  We don't want to bring in enemy soldiers, and that's what they are, into this country that are intent on destroying us and conquering us, is what they intend to do.
[01:44:40.780 --> 01:44:43.802]  Donald Trump is correct to say, hey, we want to know who these people are.
[01:44:43.842 --> 01:44:46.523]  We don't want people coming in who want to make war with us.
[01:44:46.883 --> 01:44:47.984]  And yet who's blocking them?
[01:44:48.104 --> 01:44:49.124]  It's the court system.
[01:44:49.165 --> 01:44:55.168]  Like I said earlier, how the court system is dominated by the left, by radical liberals.
[01:44:55.208 --> 01:44:57.109]  And they're saying, no, you can't have this travel ban.
[01:44:57.169 --> 01:44:58.269]  No, you can't do this, Trump.
[01:45:00.351 --> 01:45:13.321]  We've not only got to take the presidency, we've got to literally have a cultural revolution where we take every institution in our society, all the governing institutions, all the educational institutions.
[01:45:13.641 --> 01:45:16.483]  And that's why we're building our army through the Info War.
[01:45:16.543 --> 01:45:19.105]  We're in a war for hearts and minds, one at a time.
[01:45:19.646 --> 01:45:22.288]  And once upon a time, Alex Jones started very small.
[01:45:22.368 --> 01:45:24.490]  Once upon a time, I started very, very small.
[01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:27.232]  But one heart and one mind at a time.
[01:45:27.412 --> 01:45:32.336]  We've gotten to the point now, we saw during the break, where Hillary Clinton knows who Alex Jones is by name.
[01:45:32.376 --> 01:45:36.379]  She's very clear that you're one of her top enemies because you're having such an impact.
[01:45:36.699 --> 01:45:44.825]  So we're fighting the Infowar, we're building our army, but then the next stage is to literally take over the structures and institutions in society.
[01:45:44.985 --> 01:45:45.665]  And we have to.
[01:45:45.685 --> 01:45:46.286]  We have to.
[01:45:46.366 --> 01:45:49.929]  We don't want to, just like the Founding Fathers, but if we don't,
[01:45:50.689 --> 01:45:53.394]  We are complicit in our own family's destruction.
[01:45:53.434 --> 01:45:55.178]  I mean, this is so obvious to see.
[01:45:56.713 --> 01:45:57.153]  Oh, it is.
[01:45:57.233 --> 01:45:58.714]  And there's no guarantee of success.
[01:45:58.775 --> 01:46:00.816]  People often ask me, well, Michael, can we do it?
[01:46:00.856 --> 01:46:02.277]  Can we defeat the New World Order?
[01:46:02.357 --> 01:46:04.579]  Can we, you know, actually win?
[01:46:04.879 --> 01:46:15.967]  Well, with the first, the Revolutionary War, who would have ever imagined that a ragtag group of rebels could actually defeat the great British Empire, the greatest empire on the entire planet?
[01:46:16.367 --> 01:46:17.908]  Who would have thought that could have happened?
[01:46:17.968 --> 01:46:26.074]  But it did, because they were sold out, they were passionate, they were determined, they were willing to give their lives, and they gave everything for the cause of liberty,
[01:46:26.514 --> 01:46:27.054]  And freedom.
[01:46:27.475 --> 01:46:37.582]  Now today, Alex, my wife and I, about six years ago, we moved up here to Northern Idaho because we wanted to find, one of the reasons we did that, we wanted to find somewhere where people could still live free.
[01:46:37.662 --> 01:46:39.543]  Because in most of America, that's not the case.
[01:46:39.583 --> 01:46:44.987]  But we wanted to find one of these little enclaves where there was still some liberty and some freedom.
[01:46:45.067 --> 01:46:51.552]  And now they're shipping in weaponized Muslims to every small town in Idaho and every other small, I mean it is like incredible and how obvious it is.
[01:46:53.570 --> 01:46:54.111]  Oh, it's true.
[01:46:54.151 --> 01:46:56.473]  And they specifically target the small towns, Alex.
[01:46:56.833 --> 01:47:00.958]  Under the Obama administration, they were specifically targeting conservative small towns.
[01:47:00.998 --> 01:47:08.045]  He set up the Rural Affairs Group and they said, they said the countryside is too white and it's too conservative.
[01:47:08.065 --> 01:47:08.926]  Well, forget the white thing.
[01:47:08.946 --> 01:47:12.069]  They mean it's too Christian, too conservative, enclaves of Americana.
[01:47:12.450 --> 01:47:14.311]  So they said we're going to ship un...
[01:47:14.912 --> 01:47:19.296]  They're bringing in foreign Islamic boss hogs from Dearborn, Michigan to you name it to run us.
[01:47:39.161 --> 01:47:45.764]  Yeah, and now here in Idaho, we've got rapes and sexual assaults by Islamic immigrants here in Idaho, you know?
[01:47:46.165 --> 01:47:50.087]  And so, I mean, the federal government reaches everywhere.
[01:47:51.107 --> 01:47:55.610]  If you try to expand your pond, well, you can get in big trouble with the federal government.
[01:47:55.630 --> 01:47:57.831]  They can fine you millions and millions of dollars that we've seen.
[01:47:58.491 --> 01:48:02.636]  In California, there was a case where a farmer plowed his own field to grow crops.
[01:48:02.936 --> 01:48:05.539]  He got fined millions and millions of dollars by the federal government.
[01:48:05.859 --> 01:48:13.027]  There's nowhere that's out of the reach of this monster, this federal government, which is, you know, the left loves big government.
[01:48:13.567 --> 01:48:15.990]  For every problem, the solution is more government.
[01:48:16.370 --> 01:48:20.534]  But every time government grows, our freedom and liberty diminish.
[01:48:21.155 --> 01:48:29.762]  So, you know, if we're supposed to, our founding fathers wanted to establish a nation where freedom and liberty were maximized, but big government is the enemy of that.
[01:48:29.982 --> 01:48:41.971]  Every new law, and Alex, on the federal level, there's hundreds of thousands of statutes, rules, and regulations, but when you throw in the state and local levels all across this country, it goes in the millions.
[01:48:42.031 --> 01:48:48.656]  We've got millions of laws governing this country, and every new law, every new government agency, every time government grows,
[01:48:48.996 --> 01:48:51.918]  Freedom and liberty shrink, and we're losing it.
[01:48:51.999 --> 01:48:53.500]  We're losing our way.
[01:48:53.540 --> 01:48:56.402]  And our listeners know that, but people don't understand.
[01:48:56.522 --> 01:48:57.923]  It's a means to an end.
[01:48:57.983 --> 01:49:06.791]  They want control, and the useful idiots that serve this, they're just domesticated and dumbed down and think the only way they get a better job or a better lifestyle is bigger government.
[01:49:07.171 --> 01:49:10.494]  We have to somehow reach out to those people and let them know this is a trap.
[01:49:10.914 --> 01:49:11.835]  I want to go to Carlos.
[01:49:11.875 --> 01:49:12.696]  I want to go to Kristen.
[01:49:12.716 --> 01:49:13.416]  I want to go to Jeff.
[01:49:13.436 --> 01:49:13.917]  I want to go to
[01:49:16.457 --> 01:49:20.378]  Ivan, I want to go to Kevin and Ian and many others.
[01:49:20.979 --> 01:49:22.499]  Right now, let's go to Kevin.
[01:49:22.519 --> 01:49:24.540]  Let's go to Kevin in West Virginia.
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:25.620]  You're on the air with Michael Snyder.
[01:49:27.681 --> 01:49:29.922]  Hey, how is everything in Bizarro World?
[01:49:30.582 --> 01:49:31.582]  Well, we're all living here, brother.
[01:49:31.602 --> 01:49:32.063]  What do you think?
[01:49:32.083 --> 01:49:32.723]  What's on your mind?
[01:49:34.031 --> 01:49:42.114]  I have a couple of things, and the first thing is, are you serious, and I know you are, about these women in Switzerland?
[01:49:42.154 --> 01:49:44.594]  They're not going to be able to get treated for being raped?
[01:49:44.794 --> 01:49:45.175]  Sweden.
[01:49:45.595 --> 01:49:52.257]  And actually, in Stockholm, that's where they say, yes, you're being raped, go and give yourself to the Muslims, that is the loving thing to do.
[01:49:52.317 --> 01:49:53.237]  That was yesterday's news.
[01:49:53.717 --> 01:49:54.437]  That's in their news.
[01:49:54.858 --> 01:50:02.140]  That's why they call it Stockholm Syndrome, where they found in Sweden, and in other areas of the world historically, people get into being abused.
[01:50:03.467 --> 01:50:03.727]  Wow.
[01:50:04.027 --> 01:50:11.830]  The other thing that I wanted to, and the major thing that I wanted to talk to you about or ask about, I see two scenarios for the United States.
[01:50:12.391 --> 01:50:16.792]  The first scenario is a, and we're in the midst of it, a civil war.
[01:50:16.812 --> 01:50:26.616]  And the next thing that I see, and I don't want it to happen, but I would rather that happen than the civil war, would be a Soviet-style collapse of the United States.
[01:50:26.776 --> 01:50:27.937]  I think it needs to come down.
[01:50:29.673 --> 01:50:30.373]  Well, you said it.
[01:50:30.413 --> 01:50:33.274]  We're in the middle of a political civil war to retake the country.
[01:50:33.314 --> 01:50:36.675]  The globalists are trying to destroy everything, trying to wreck the nation openly.
[01:50:36.695 --> 01:50:38.195]  They admit they're trying to kill the stock market.
[01:50:39.196 --> 01:50:39.956]  Those are great points.
[01:50:39.976 --> 01:50:52.339]  We'll come back and ask Michael Snyder that question, Kevin, thank you, about how do we keep this cold civil war from going to a hot civil war, with the Democrats calling for nationwide riots, also in Europe, coming up next month.
[01:50:52.399 --> 01:50:52.979]  We'll be back.
[01:50:52.999 --> 01:50:53.360]  Stay with us.
[01:50:59.768 --> 01:51:05.336]  Does your shampoo leave your scalp itchy and your hair dry and frizzy?

[01:52:49.906 --> 01:52:58.172]  Well, I gotta tell you, Millie Weaver and her great accomplice in patriotic crime against the New World Order, Gavin, aren't just amazing researchers and reporters.
[01:52:58.633 --> 01:53:01.335]  They're also really, really good at shooting commercials.
[01:53:01.775 --> 01:53:10.942]  I mean, that thing looks like some million-dollar Hollywood commercial, and they shot that right here in Austin, Texas, to support the broadcast, without me even asking them to do it.
[01:53:11.402 --> 01:53:17.447]  And that's because Millie is really into high-quality organic shampoo, body wash, things like that.
[01:53:17.967 --> 01:53:24.112]  And she tried Emmerich's Essentials and just thought that it was amazing, so she had the idea with Gavin to produce the ad you just saw.
[01:53:24.172 --> 01:53:28.175]  But believe me, the product is just as good as the cover.
[01:53:28.615 --> 01:53:33.719]  You'll find Emmerich's Essentials at infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:53:36.781 --> 01:53:40.185]  And again, I'd like to thank the listeners and the viewers for their ongoing support.
[01:53:40.425 --> 01:53:41.927]  Without you, there would be no InfoWar.
[01:53:42.287 --> 01:53:45.170]  And I'd like to thank Millie and Gavin for really going the extra mile.
[01:53:45.210 --> 01:53:48.754]  I think this is one of the best commercials I've ever seen, and I'm really proud that it's ours.
[01:53:49.415 --> 01:53:54.521]  So again, folks, find out why Emirates Essentials has so many people really giving it five-star reviews.
[01:54:07.720 --> 01:54:08.480]  Look at Hollywood.
[01:54:08.700 --> 01:54:09.420]  It's collapsing.
[01:54:10.761 --> 01:54:11.361]  They don't care though.
[01:54:11.381 --> 01:54:12.261]  They want to bring the country down.
[01:54:12.301 --> 01:54:13.142]  They admit they do.
[01:54:14.182 --> 01:54:16.623]  Ariana Grande says she hopes her effing fans die.
[01:54:17.363 --> 01:54:20.824]  I ask, why do Muslims keep attacking liberals and why do liberals keep bringing in Muslims?
[01:54:21.325 --> 01:54:25.086]  And Megyn Kelly asks me, what's this about you blaming the little kids got blown up?
[01:54:26.192 --> 01:54:29.237]  No, I blame the trendies that open the borders up and bring people in.
[01:54:29.798 --> 01:54:34.447]  I don't blame the kids, obviously, but how do you turn it around when the left says bring in the Muslims?
[01:54:35.492 --> 01:54:40.495]  Then it kills a bunch of people that this ideology blamed the people that tried to stop it.
[01:54:40.555 --> 01:54:41.336]  How smart!
[01:54:42.016 --> 01:54:43.437]  That's what they've got to do though.
[01:54:43.957 --> 01:54:46.319]  Always change the subject like you're weak minded.
[01:54:46.339 --> 01:54:51.062]  We're going to go to Christian and Jeff and Ian and others here in just a second.
[01:54:51.782 --> 01:54:55.505]  And John, Michael Schneider, writer, educator, author.
[01:54:58.237 --> 01:54:59.098]  We're in a civil war.
[01:54:59.138 --> 01:55:00.179]  I mean, history's happening.
[01:55:00.239 --> 01:55:04.083]  It's so big now that I've always known we were fighting this and I want to fight it.
[01:55:04.123 --> 01:55:08.929]  It's so real now that I'm more dedicated than ever, but it's like...
[01:55:10.498 --> 01:55:11.799]  Nothing is fun anymore.
[01:55:12.259 --> 01:55:13.320]  It's like total war.
[01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:15.741]  I don't care about being around celebrities.
[01:55:15.781 --> 01:55:16.781]  I don't even care about money.
[01:55:16.801 --> 01:55:17.942]  All I care about is my kids.
[01:55:17.962 --> 01:55:19.003]  And I never really cared about their stuff.
[01:55:19.023 --> 01:55:24.245]  But now, it makes me sick watching everybody fawn over Megyn Kelly.
[01:55:24.666 --> 01:55:26.787]  It makes me... Nothing even against her.
[01:55:28.007 --> 01:55:29.908]  People... I don't know how to explain it.
[01:55:29.928 --> 01:55:32.390]  It's just... All that matters is our freedom.
[01:55:32.410 --> 01:55:33.230]  And it's under attack.
[01:55:33.610 --> 01:55:35.071]  And we're fighting such evil.
[01:55:35.191 --> 01:55:36.472]  People need to break the trance.
[01:55:40.444 --> 01:55:42.226]  The left is relentless.
[01:55:42.266 --> 01:55:43.627]  They're never going to give up.
[01:55:43.667 --> 01:55:45.629]  They're not going to give any quarter.
[01:55:45.950 --> 01:55:47.572]  We're in an all-out war.
[01:55:47.692 --> 01:55:57.443]  Now the last caller talked about a civil war, but we do not ever want it to get violent because violence is not our message.
[01:55:57.483 --> 01:56:00.907]  We've got a far superior message than anything the left could ever have.
[01:56:01.207 --> 01:56:09.731]  You know, we've got the Constitution, we've got the values and principles this country was founded upon, and they work, and they once made America the greatest place on the entire planet, and they can do it again.
[01:56:10.071 --> 01:56:13.373]  But the left has shown they're willing to increasingly become violent.
[01:56:13.393 --> 01:56:16.634]  In recent years, we've seen street protests get more and more violent.
[01:56:16.854 --> 01:56:20.436]  Then Kathy Griffin just did us one of the greatest favors that anybody has done
[01:56:20.916 --> 01:56:20.996]  Yes.
[01:56:37.538 --> 01:56:37.658]  Yeah.
[01:56:56.275 --> 01:56:56.896]  And the thing is,
[01:57:21.238 --> 01:57:45.114]  How could anybody claim they're anti-establishment when the Republican establishment, the foreign governments, the EU, the corrupt Pope, the Communist Chinese, Hollywood, the Democrats, all want to destroy him, and then he's delivering prosperity, he's not letting multinationals screw over people, he's building factories in minority areas everywhere, and it just gives me chills at how much they hate him.
[01:57:45.154 --> 01:57:46.475]  And it isn't about worshipping Trump!
[01:57:46.995 --> 01:57:49.557]  I can't believe, it's like that British Member of Parliament said,
[01:57:50.816 --> 01:57:56.473]  He's gonna go down as the only roundly criticized politician who got in trouble for keeping his campaign promises.
[01:57:58.416 --> 01:58:04.379]  Yeah, that we've never seen hatred, I don't think, for any politician at the level that we see hatred for Donald Trump.
[01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:20.729]  And I don't know if even Donald Trump fully understands, but he has come to represent everything that, therefore, their progressive agenda, the progressive agenda not only in this country, but the global progressive agenda, which is dominating the Western world, the New World Order,
[01:58:21.289 --> 01:58:32.198]  And I don't even know to what extent Donald Trump understands he's not literally just fighting the Democrats, not literally just fighting the Republican establishment, but literally fighting the New World Order.
[01:58:32.218 --> 01:58:32.879]  That's right, stay there.
[01:58:32.899 --> 01:58:35.581]  We're gonna come right back in 70 seconds and go right to Kristen.
[01:58:35.601 --> 01:58:36.562]  Thank you for listening.
[01:58:36.662 --> 01:58:38.584]  And right to Jeff, who just came back from Paris.
[01:58:39.405 --> 01:58:40.806]  Oh man, well our crew has been there.
[01:58:40.886 --> 01:58:41.767]  It is hellish now.
[01:58:42.127 --> 01:58:43.608]  Beautiful Paris is a crap hole.
[01:58:45.290 --> 01:58:46.931]  I'm gonna lay it out short and sweet.
[01:58:48.727 --> 01:58:54.391]  I got so dedicated to fighting the globalists and their program for world government that I stopped working out.
[01:58:55.112 --> 01:58:58.995]  I was a total fitness nut 20 years ago.
[01:58:59.955 --> 01:59:02.176]  About 15 years ago, I just stopped working out.
[01:59:02.256 --> 01:59:03.397]  I gained close to 100 pounds.
[01:59:04.078 --> 01:59:06.659]  I have lost 50, 60 pounds of fat.
[01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:07.980]  Or more.
[01:59:08.060 --> 01:59:10.001]  I've gained 20 pounds of muscle.
[01:59:10.482 --> 01:59:11.962]  I'm stronger than I was when I was 22.
[01:59:13.183 --> 01:59:15.425]  When I could bench press close to 400 pounds and squat 600.
[01:59:15.525 --> 01:59:17.346]  It's actually scary.
[01:59:18.186 --> 01:59:28.212]  And it's because I take products that are researchers developed that block the estrogen mimickers that basically feminize men.
[01:59:29.253 --> 01:59:42.080]  We've produced these products with top scientists and researchers like Dr. Group to help you counteract the globalist onslaught and at the same time support InfoWars in our fight for both human liberty and freedom.
[01:59:47.043 --> 01:59:52.947]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:01.596 --> 02:00:05.118]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:00:05.679 --> 02:00:07.420]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:07.580 --> 02:00:17.967]  You know, I just hate the polished professionalism of the globalists.
[02:00:18.047 --> 02:00:20.129]  Their cold-bloodedness.
[02:00:31.084 --> 02:00:35.125]  Because they track whatever the best course is for their own personal power.
[02:00:36.466 --> 02:00:37.726]  The expense of humanity.
[02:00:39.007 --> 02:00:43.328]  I said some pretty mean things about Megyn Kelly and then she's like sending me nice voicemails and stuff.
[02:00:44.008 --> 02:00:45.309]  But it wasn't nice during the interview.
[02:00:47.995 --> 02:00:49.396]  And I'm not even afraid of that.
[02:00:49.496 --> 02:00:52.797]  I just, it's weird how they want to say that they're not being mean when they are.
[02:00:52.858 --> 02:01:00.602]  It's like this mind game and not pretending like MSM has this agenda and not pretending like they're following an exact script to destroy me.
[02:01:01.282 --> 02:01:06.124]  So they can have this example to others and say, you better not stand up or we'll crush you.
[02:01:08.005 --> 02:01:09.646]  I'm not afraid of them trying to destroy me.
[02:01:10.167 --> 02:01:10.527]  I'm not.
[02:01:11.756 --> 02:01:15.899]  I am afraid of them intimidating you, because the globalists don't have the power.
[02:01:16.299 --> 02:01:17.320]  They're losing the power.
[02:01:17.820 --> 02:01:18.621]  They're panicking.
[02:01:19.001 --> 02:01:20.062]  And they've gotten desperate.
[02:01:20.082 --> 02:01:21.643]  They're trying to bully us into submission.
[02:01:21.663 --> 02:01:23.864]  And there's one thing in my life I hadn't liked is bullies.
[02:01:24.545 --> 02:01:25.385]  And I'm sick of them.
[02:01:26.086 --> 02:01:27.046]  Michael Steiner's our guest.
[02:01:27.447 --> 02:01:29.748]  Christian in Tennessee, or Kristen, and then I'm going to go to Jeff.
[02:01:30.089 --> 02:01:31.309]  Kristen in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[02:01:31.329 --> 02:01:31.870]  Thanks for holding.
[02:01:33.126 --> 02:01:35.869]  I'm sorry, Christian, I'm sorry, third time's the charm.
[02:01:49.825 --> 02:01:49.945]  Well,
[02:02:04.582 --> 02:02:07.043]  Ma'am, send us a resume at Jobs and Infowars.
[02:02:07.063 --> 02:02:09.303]  We barely have the crew to look at the resumes.
[02:02:09.323 --> 02:02:10.883]  We're at that kind of building point.
[02:02:10.903 --> 02:02:11.924]  It's so hard to get through.
[02:02:12.604 --> 02:02:14.124]  But Jobs and Infowars dot com.
[02:02:14.184 --> 02:02:14.724]  Absolutely.
[02:02:15.284 --> 02:02:16.425]  Tell us about Obama crash.
[02:02:16.445 --> 02:02:19.525]  Because the globalists were implementing a global financial meltdown.
[02:02:19.565 --> 02:02:20.206]  They admitted that.
[02:02:20.226 --> 02:02:20.786]  That's come out.
[02:02:21.086 --> 02:02:22.366]  Trump's trying to block that.
[02:02:22.426 --> 02:02:24.406]  Ron Paul agrees very valiantly.
[02:02:24.707 --> 02:02:26.247]  What do you think the Obama crash is?
[02:02:27.392 --> 02:02:42.620]  Okay, the three reasons why, in my book, Singaporean Thoughts, why there is going to be an Obama crash is, number one, 94 million unemployed and 44 million illegals, which, you know, they say it's 11 million, but it's actually 44.
[02:02:43.781 --> 02:02:49.885]  Second reason is because of the cyclical, which was supposed to crash every seven years.
[02:02:49.945 --> 02:02:54.748]  So the second reason is it was supposed to crash in 2015 and Obama manipulated it.
[02:02:55.108 --> 02:03:08.176]  And the third reason is the Fed, which is, of course, we know, owned by the Rothschilds, and they have already raised the interest rate once on Trump, so they're going to burst the interest rate bubble by raising it twice more.
[02:03:08.196 --> 02:03:11.197]  They only raised it on Obama two times in eight years.
[02:03:12.738 --> 02:03:13.379]  We're good to go.
[02:03:38.581 --> 02:03:40.524]  No, no, Oliver Stone's a real liberal.
[02:03:40.584 --> 02:03:46.953]  I mean, he's got liberal policies I don't agree with, but he's a real guy who stands up for the truth over and over again when it's politically incorrect.
[02:03:46.973 --> 02:03:50.939]  But Michael Schneider, you've got the news site Economic Collapse blog.
[02:03:51.961 --> 02:03:53.363]  I think a lot of what she's saying makes sense.
[02:03:53.383 --> 02:03:53.784]  What do you think?
[02:03:54.750 --> 02:03:56.671]  Oh definitely, especially about the Federal Reserve.
[02:03:56.731 --> 02:04:01.353]  Because a stock market crash, I believe, is coming, but it's not going to be Donald Trump's fault.
[02:04:01.473 --> 02:04:06.134]  For example, in the second half of this year, if the stock market crashes, all the fingers are going to be pointed at Trump.
[02:04:06.174 --> 02:04:14.938]  But we need to educate people that the Federal Reserve has far more power over the economy and our financial system than presidents, than Congress, than anyone else.
[02:04:15.338 --> 02:04:20.340]  And during the Obama years, the Federal Reserve pushed interest rates all the way to the floor, as low as they could go.
[02:04:20.820 --> 02:04:35.934]  And then they injected just trillions of hot dollars into the system through their quantitative easing programs, unprecedented intervention into the financial system like we've never seen before, created this giant bubble, stock market going to all-time highs.
[02:04:36.534 --> 02:04:41.078]  But throughout, since 1913, there have been 18 distinct recessions or depressions.
[02:04:41.138 --> 02:04:42.840]  Hold on, Snyder, finish up on the other side.
[02:04:44.762 --> 02:04:46.383]  He can't hear me because his Skype cuts over it.
[02:04:47.885 --> 02:04:48.526]  Kirsten, thank you.
[02:04:48.546 --> 02:04:49.687]  We're gonna be right back with Michael Snyder.
[02:04:49.948 --> 02:04:50.668]  We'll have him finish.
[02:04:50.688 --> 02:04:51.369]  We have the next guest.
[02:04:55.694 --> 02:04:57.857]  Imagine the world without InfoWars.
[02:05:01.294 --> 02:05:03.295]  The globalists have already consolidated their palette.
[02:05:03.775 --> 02:05:07.496]  They don't want people to have their own economies, their own choices.
[02:05:08.196 --> 02:05:21.500]  When you spread the links to Infowars.com news stories and our videos, when you tell friends, family, and neighbors about our free iPhone and Droid apps, or send them a link to our daily podcast, you are involved in a revolutionary act against tyranny.
[02:05:21.940 --> 02:05:27.082]  It was George Orwell that said, in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[02:05:27.842 --> 02:05:39.046]  That's why I spend a lot of time trying to not just innovate news and analysis and our fight against the globalists, but also thinking about how we're able to fund our operation.
[02:05:39.346 --> 02:05:42.087]  That's so critical to prosecute an information war.
[02:05:43.075 --> 02:05:58.050]  And I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic and high quality.
[02:05:58.451 --> 02:06:00.613]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we have private labeled it.
[02:06:01.832 --> 02:06:02.012]  Yeah.
[02:06:18.143 --> 02:06:23.745]  You get an additional, out of the gates, 25% off on this product.
[02:06:24.305 --> 02:06:26.927]  Emerix Essentials is all about personal care.
[02:06:27.367 --> 02:06:27.987]  Hygiene.
[02:06:28.267 --> 02:06:29.448]  Not getting skin cancer.
[02:06:29.968 --> 02:06:33.649]  Not getting bit by a bunch of bugs and gnats and mosquitoes.
[02:06:34.129 --> 02:06:35.110]  It's all there.
[02:06:35.270 --> 02:06:36.050]  The body wash.
[02:06:36.170 --> 02:06:36.911]  The shampoo.
[02:06:37.471 --> 02:06:38.111]  The deodorant.
[02:06:38.571 --> 02:06:39.311]  The mouthwash.
[02:06:39.772 --> 02:06:40.132]  All of it.
[02:06:40.752 --> 02:06:41.893]  Is truly game-changing.
[02:06:42.373 --> 02:06:43.173]  BOA spray.
[02:06:43.474 --> 02:06:45.495]  Totally organic, essential oils.
[02:06:46.215 --> 02:06:49.777]  Works a lot better than the toxic chemical systems that are out there.
[02:06:50.157 --> 02:06:52.419]  And it is comparable in price.
[02:06:52.719 --> 02:06:54.160]  And again, it's concentrated.
[02:06:54.500 --> 02:06:55.921]  The deodorant is amazing.
[02:06:56.381 --> 02:06:57.061]  High quality.
[02:06:57.742 --> 02:06:59.283]  Doesn't have the aluminum garbage in it.
[02:06:59.563 --> 02:07:00.303]  Totally natural.
[02:07:00.583 --> 02:07:01.044]  Works great.
[02:07:01.984 --> 02:07:05.748]  SPF 30, face and body lotion, sunscreen, unscented.
[02:07:06.309 --> 02:07:11.074]  This is exciting because so many of the so-called sunscreens that are out there are toxic.
[02:07:11.194 --> 02:07:13.516]  Because everyone knows I'm obsessed with Win-Wins.
[02:07:13.536 --> 02:07:14.717]  20% off what it is retail.
[02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:23.087]  Because we cut out the middleman, and then additionally, if you sign up for auto-ship, out of the gates, 25% off that.
[02:07:23.567 --> 02:07:37.942]  Because I want you to try these products, I want you to love these products, I want to have a deeper relationship with you in a 360 win, a non-zero-sum game, where you get high quality, you get value, and you repeat order something you need every month.
[02:07:38.803 --> 02:07:46.434]  And then we're able to secure our funding into the future to not just stay at the level we're at, but to grow in the face of enemy attacks.
[02:07:46.734 --> 02:07:51.361]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, and you'll find Emmerich's Essentials.
[02:08:07.554 --> 02:08:11.855]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:12.215 --> 02:08:17.676]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:19.216 --> 02:08:33.559]  We're about to finish up with Michael Schneider on the Obama crash, or the globalist plan to implode the economy, a lot of the factors that are
[02:08:34.853 --> 02:08:35.753]  Coming together right now?
[02:08:36.114 --> 02:08:53.820]  They're trying to plunge the stock market in the news and the Democrats are saying it's a good thing to stop Trump when it's the Trump exuberance and the election and the policies that have got the stock market and the economy going from a stall to a partial re-ignition.
[02:08:54.860 --> 02:08:55.501]  But they don't care.
[02:08:55.581 --> 02:08:57.982]  They'd rather wreck the whole country to have full control.
[02:08:58.822 --> 02:09:01.403]  To not just stop Trump, but stop a populist movement.
[02:09:02.227 --> 02:09:07.088]  We're going to be talking to a gentleman who's running against Pocahontas in the Senate.
[02:09:08.188 --> 02:09:11.129]  We have Dr. Shiva Iyadurai joining us.
[02:09:11.429 --> 02:09:12.509]  Coming up here in just a few minutes.
[02:09:13.349 --> 02:09:18.010]  But first off, let's go to Michael Schneider to finish up with a historical breakdown.
[02:09:18.990 --> 02:09:20.090]  You got interrupted by the break.
[02:09:20.371 --> 02:09:22.071]  Kind of roll through the economic climate.
[02:09:22.451 --> 02:09:27.492]  The two countervailing forces of nationalism, Trumpism,
[02:09:28.874 --> 02:09:32.936]  Coming in, but is it too little too late to stop the global economic meltdown?
[02:09:34.197 --> 02:09:37.138]  Well, Donald Trump can't keep the Federal Reserve from raising rates.
[02:09:37.218 --> 02:09:40.099]  If they want to raise rates, they know that's going to slow the economy down.
[02:09:40.139 --> 02:09:43.721]  They know that's going to hurt the financial markets, but they might want to do that to hurt Trump.
[02:09:44.121 --> 02:09:46.102]  Now, these booms and busts keep getting worse.
[02:09:46.162 --> 02:09:50.244]  For example, 2008, that crisis was worse than when the dot-com bubble burst.
[02:09:50.544 --> 02:09:52.746]  And this next one is looking like it's going to be a lot worse than 2008.
[02:09:53.786 --> 02:09:53.966]  Yes.
[02:10:15.009 --> 02:10:16.711]  Well, I'm thinking running for public office.
[02:10:16.751 --> 02:10:18.052]  We need to do it all over the country.
[02:10:18.333 --> 02:10:28.664]  We need to get rid of the debt-based Federal Reserve, their debt-based currency, go to a new system, because if we don't, this is going to keep happening over and over again, no matter which political party's in control.
[02:10:30.666 --> 02:10:35.411]  But will they be successful looking at all the different forces to stop the Trump recovery?
[02:10:38.806 --> 02:10:39.606]  Well, we'll see.
[02:10:39.626 --> 02:10:50.712]  You know, I think that they're really targeting in the second half of this year and beyond for, you know, if the economy turns down, that can turn a lot of people against Trump.
[02:10:50.812 --> 02:10:57.576]  I think Democrats are secretly hoping that that's going to happen so that they turn hearts and minds against Trump.
[02:10:57.836 --> 02:11:02.598]  And so, I mean, they're really targeting the 2018 midterm elections really hard.
[02:11:02.618 --> 02:11:03.739]  The Democrats are right now.
[02:11:06.140 --> 02:11:07.561]  What else is on the economic horizon?
[02:11:08.908 --> 02:11:10.969]  Well, Alex, we're seeing a lot of troubling signs.
[02:11:11.009 --> 02:11:15.491]  For example, right now in the auto industry, we're seeing sales are way down.
[02:11:16.151 --> 02:11:19.753]  And a lot of that for the auto industry, we're already essentially in a recession.
[02:11:20.193 --> 02:11:29.818]  In terms of the retail space, it's a retail apocalypse where we're on pace for more stores to close this year than ever before in American history.
[02:11:30.158 --> 02:11:33.980]  Sure, isn't that Amazon doing to Walmart what Walmart did to small towns?
[02:11:35.083 --> 02:11:38.066]  Well, that's a big part of the Internet coming in and destroying things.
[02:11:38.407 --> 02:11:45.976]  But Alex, even beyond that, I mean, we're going to shatter the all-time record by 20% in terms of most store closings.
[02:11:46.396 --> 02:11:49.580]  And so we're starting to see all these factors come together.
[02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:52.303]  We're starting to see commercial and industrial loans
[02:11:52.523 --> 02:12:03.831]  Slow down credit is tightening up and that happens in the early phase of an economic slowdown where because everything in our society is dead in credit and when credit starts to tighten up that slows down economic activity.
[02:12:04.131 --> 02:12:05.072]  Same thing that happened in 2008.
[02:12:05.472 --> 02:12:15.859]  So all these signs that you would expect to see in the right before a recession or in the early parts of a recession are happening right now and has been so long since you know 2008.
[02:12:15.899 --> 02:12:19.862]  So, you know, we've had a long time but even with that, you know,
[02:12:20.282 --> 02:12:27.271]  This so-called recovery, Alex, if you go back and you average economic growth in the last 10 years, I went back and did this with a calculator.
[02:12:27.892 --> 02:12:31.337]  Over the last 10 years, we've had average economic growth in this country of 1.33%.
[02:12:31.377 --> 02:12:34.141]  So then I went back into the 1930s and averaged those 10 years in the 1930s.
[02:12:38.446 --> 02:12:41.648]  And I averaged economic growth during the 1930s.
[02:12:41.688 --> 02:12:46.211]  The Depression comes to 1.33% exactly equal.
[02:12:46.491 --> 02:12:52.395]  So our average economic growth over the last 10 years is exactly equal to during the Great Depression in the 1930s.
[02:12:52.775 --> 02:12:55.016]  And now it looks like things are slowing down again.
[02:12:55.036 --> 02:13:05.363]  And Donald Trump, he's been able to do some things through executive orders, but most of the biggest things, whether it's reducing taxes, whether it's, you know, getting rid of government agencies, getting rid of red tape,
[02:13:05.803 --> 02:13:11.466]  He needs Congress to do that, and the establishment Republicans in Congress are blocking him.
[02:13:11.747 --> 02:13:17.970]  So we've got to do something about those establishment Republicans if we ever want the full Trump agenda to move forward.
[02:13:18.210 --> 02:13:18.691]  That's right.
[02:13:18.831 --> 02:13:20.492]  We've got to expand that Freedom Caucus.
[02:13:20.532 --> 02:13:21.812]  Thank you so much, Michael Snyder.
[02:13:23.293 --> 02:13:23.934]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:13:24.622 --> 02:13:35.358]  Now we've got our next guest with us, still about 40 after, so I'm going to continue with your phone calls, Jeff and Ian and John and Carlos and Jason, who's calling from Germany.
[02:13:35.378 --> 02:13:38.242]  We'll also talk some about the big testimony from Comey.
[02:13:39.986 --> 02:13:42.547]  Telling us about the ghost of Russian collusion.
[02:13:43.548 --> 02:13:49.711]  But I love the fact that we were just talking about running for local office, running for national office, even if you don't win.
[02:13:49.731 --> 02:13:52.792]  In this climate, a lot of folks are against incumbents.
[02:13:53.093 --> 02:13:57.375]  You're educating people in the town halls, the debates, the local radio.
[02:13:57.795 --> 02:14:04.078]  This is where you can get so much free publicity to promote Americana and Renaissance and basic freedom ideas.
[02:14:04.658 --> 02:14:07.540]  Now, I would interview Dr. Shiva here.
[02:14:08.985 --> 02:14:18.089]  Just to pick his brain how interesting his life is with all of his four degrees from MIT and all of his work, all the things he's invented.
[02:14:19.129 --> 02:14:24.912]  But now it's really exciting to see that he's running against a particular senator
[02:14:25.612 --> 02:14:27.433]  Uh, who is really pushing the globalist agenda.
[02:14:27.453 --> 02:14:31.756]  So, uh, I'm aware of this guy and I'm a fan, but you're an even bigger fan and aware of him longer.
[02:14:31.776 --> 02:14:34.758]  So why don't you introduce our next guest here, Owen Schroer?
[02:14:34.978 --> 02:14:40.222]  Well, it's been great talking to Dr. Shiva because it's just like the same way when I'm talking to Omar Navarro.
[02:14:40.242 --> 02:14:49.108]  I feel like I'm talking to a regular guy, somebody that I could go out, sit down, enjoy lunch with, enjoy a beverage with and not somebody that wants to try to screw me or screw this country.
[02:14:49.148 --> 02:14:51.269]  So that's just refreshing to begin with.
[02:14:51.549 --> 02:14:55.112]  But Alex, what Shiva is doing right now, and I'm glad to have him on to talk about this.
[02:14:56.072 --> 02:15:04.355]  He's putting out an ultimatum to Elizabeth Warren to put her money where her mouth is when it comes to the Monsanto Protection Act and GMOs.
[02:15:04.715 --> 02:15:17.200]  Now, Doctor, you actually have some statistics here showing that GMOs and how they affect the formaldehyde implants and the glutathione implants, and you're willing to put your money where the mouth is.
[02:15:17.240 --> 02:15:19.881]  You're offering Elizabeth Warren your lab, your car.
[02:15:20.241 --> 02:15:21.321]  Say, do these tests.
[02:15:21.401 --> 02:15:22.161]  Make them public.
[02:15:22.201 --> 02:15:23.542]  Have you gotten a response from her yet?
[02:15:24.724 --> 02:15:25.184]  No, we haven't.
[02:15:25.264 --> 02:15:28.547]  I mean, first of all, thanks, Alan and Owen, for having me on here.
[02:15:28.567 --> 02:15:33.131]  You know, I want to use this opportunity actually live on your show to challenge Elizabeth Warren.
[02:15:33.151 --> 02:15:45.021]  You know, I did, using the technology that I created at MIT, we essentially showed that GMO soy, for example, has nearly 300% less glutathione and it upregulates formaldehyde.
[02:15:45.061 --> 02:15:46.983]  We published this in a series of five papers.
[02:15:47.003 --> 02:15:51.967]  It was, in fact, validated by independent experiments that were done in Leeds, in London.
[02:15:52.307 --> 02:15:58.316]  But the bottom line is when you look at Elizabeth Warren, not only is she a fake Indian, but she's also a fake fighter.
[02:15:58.336 --> 02:16:02.503]  You know, she has supported the Monsanto Protection Act.
[02:16:02.543 --> 02:16:05.327]  She voted for this and this act basically
[02:16:08.233 --> 02:16:08.514]  Sure.
[02:16:26.933 --> 02:16:36.459]  Through this Monsanto Protection Act bill, which was snuck in into an appropriations bill at the last minute, allows the Department of Agriculture to intercede and stop that.
[02:16:36.479 --> 02:16:52.629]  But fundamentally, when you look at it, when you look at all the research, which is what we did, and we connected that together using this technology, we found out that genetically engineered soy, by the way, 97% of the soy in the United States is genetically engineered, has less glutathione,
[02:16:53.209 --> 02:16:58.177]  Nearly 300%, which is extremely important for protecting the plant and thereby upregulates formaldehyde.
[02:16:58.477 --> 02:17:08.092]  You know, when we published this, we were attacked by a professor at the University of Florida who's since been exposed for being in collusion with Monsanto, a guy called Kevin Folta.
[02:17:09.053 --> 02:17:16.920]  But more importantly, what we've shown is that when you look at the academic elite, they like to use science, fake science, to create narratives.
[02:17:17.360 --> 02:17:29.491]  The problem they have with me is I have four degrees from MIT, including my PhD in Biological Engineering, and because I've been successful because of America, because of the journey I went through, I can actually challenge these people.
[02:17:29.531 --> 02:17:35.636]  So the official challenge is I will give my $10 million building in Cambridge, including the campaign bus we're using,
[02:17:35.936 --> 02:17:45.179]  I'll in fact throw in my 1994 beautiful Corvette to Elizabeth Warren if she can disprove that GMOs have any safety assessment standards.
[02:17:45.199 --> 02:17:49.420]  The reality is there are no safety assessment standards for GMOs.
[02:17:50.700 --> 02:17:54.101]  Predominantly, most of the academics in biology do not even address this question.
[02:17:54.421 --> 02:17:56.042]  It's pay to play science right now, Owen.
[02:17:58.083 --> 02:17:58.263]  That's
[02:18:19.594 --> 02:18:20.655]  Cytosolv Inc.
[02:18:20.695 --> 02:18:24.117]  and a bunch of other companies, and it's sashiva4senate.com.
[02:18:24.537 --> 02:18:29.119]  But very, very exciting to see, you know, the fact that you're weighing in here and taking action.
[02:18:29.240 --> 02:18:31.601]  I'm not a molecular biologist.
[02:18:31.681 --> 02:18:32.782]  I'm not a genetic engineer.
[02:18:32.822 --> 02:18:40.586]  I'm not an expert on this, but I know that glutathione is a key amino acid that's basically found in the body, and then as you lose it, it makes you age faster.
[02:18:40.906 --> 02:18:45.709]  And I did know that glyphosate's been associated with that and a lot of other stuff happening in these GMO plants.
[02:18:46.109 --> 02:18:47.330]  How does this affect us?
[02:18:47.890 --> 02:18:51.951]  When these plants have a lot less of this, or is it just affecting the overall yield of the plant?
[02:18:51.991 --> 02:18:54.931]  What's the big issue with it lowering glutathione?
[02:18:55.632 --> 02:18:57.952]  Well, it's a great question, Alex.
[02:18:57.972 --> 02:18:58.692]  This is what's happening.
[02:18:58.992 --> 02:19:06.694]  So fundamentally, you know, Monsanto basically did this fake science to convince us that these genetically engineered plants were better for us.
[02:19:06.794 --> 02:19:08.334]  But the reality is they're weaker.
[02:19:08.714 --> 02:19:09.774]  So two things happen.
[02:19:09.794 --> 02:19:17.496]  If you have read or if you've noticed, many of these GMO seeds are coated now with an insecticide called neonicotinoid.
[02:19:17.956 --> 02:19:18.777]  Neonicotinoids.
[02:19:19.057 --> 02:19:20.939]  And people have always wondered why they're doing that.
[02:19:20.979 --> 02:19:29.545]  The reality is that plants are weaker, the seeds are weaker, so when they plant it, because it has less glutathione, soil organisms can destroy it.
[02:19:29.565 --> 02:19:31.287]  That's why they coat it with neonicotinoids.
[02:19:31.487 --> 02:19:38.292]  Well, those neonicotinoids also get throughout the plant, they affect bees in the atmosphere, which affect the entire environment.
[02:19:38.312 --> 02:19:41.275]  So that's one reason that this is significantly harmful.
[02:19:41.295 --> 02:19:44.898]  Sure, and wouldn't that poison then over time affect the genetic expression of the plants?
[02:19:45.578 --> 02:19:45.998]  Exactly.
[02:19:46.018 --> 02:19:47.860]  It affects the genetic expression of the plants.
[02:19:47.880 --> 02:19:51.543]  But more importantly, a recent paper just came out in Nature.
[02:19:51.563 --> 02:19:52.103]  We got a break.
[02:19:52.123 --> 02:19:52.584]  Stay right there.
[02:19:52.624 --> 02:19:53.444]  This is Riveting Doctor.
[02:19:53.484 --> 02:19:57.167]  We'll be back with Dr. C. Michael Schneider is our guest.
[02:19:57.527 --> 02:19:58.969]  I was going to get him on about these stories.
[02:19:59.029 --> 02:20:05.013]  Baltimore has become a rotting, decaying war zone as raging opioid epidemic eats away at the city like a cancer.
[02:20:05.734 --> 02:20:13.600]  Thousands flee Chicago, drugs linked to this, for safer areas of the country as America's third largest city becomes a gang-infested wasteland.
[02:20:13.740 --> 02:20:30.138]  Yeah, a couple days ago I wrote an article which went viral on Drudge Report, was posted on Drudge Report, got a ton of attention about Chicago, the third largest city in America, once one of the greatest cities in the world, has descended into and basically becoming a total nightmare.
[02:20:30.318 --> 02:20:34.203]  Gang members outnumber the police in Chicago by more than a 12 to 1 margin.
[02:20:35.664 --> 02:20:44.911]  And it's thanks to unchecked illegal immigration, the Latin American gangs coming across the border are just pouring into places like Chicago and creating violence like crazy.
[02:20:44.931 --> 02:20:50.355]  In fact, just this week, the Chicago police issued an alert telling every member of the Chicago police force
[02:20:50.815 --> 02:20:53.457]  About the high-powered weapons that the gangs are using.
[02:20:54.198 --> 02:20:56.620]  Because they're just not using, you know, little pop guns.
[02:20:56.640 --> 02:20:59.582]  They're using automatic weapons in many cases.
[02:21:00.043 --> 02:21:01.644]  And so Chicago is totally out of control.
[02:21:01.664 --> 02:21:02.705]  So people are leaving.
[02:21:03.145 --> 02:21:13.113]  In fact, last year, 2016, Cook County had lost more people through domestic migration than any other county in America.
[02:21:13.133 --> 02:21:14.294]  Because people are getting out.
[02:21:14.874 --> 02:21:22.419]  And in one recent year, 2015, 3,000 millionaires, millionaires left the city of Chicago for other places.
[02:21:22.459 --> 02:21:31.025]  So people are fleeing, they're getting out, they don't want to raise their families where there's so much violence, so much crime, where things are completely out of control.
[02:21:31.245 --> 02:21:41.572]  If we see crime exploding in Chicago, the murder rate increases 60% last year, while the economy is still relatively stable, what's going to happen if we have a major downturn?
[02:21:42.092 --> 02:21:49.219]  Because, you know, right now, Alex, the number of retail bankruptcies has already surpassed all of last year.
[02:21:49.780 --> 02:21:57.488]  And if we continue at the same pace that we're on, we're going to break the all-time yearly record for store closings for retail stores by more than 20%.
[02:21:57.588 --> 02:22:01.732]  We're not just going to break the record, we're going to absolutely shatter it.
[02:22:01.912 --> 02:22:05.293]  So we've got all these economic red flags going up all around us.
[02:22:05.673 --> 02:22:10.115]  These trends started under Obama, so Obama should get the blame, but Trump's going to get the blame.
[02:22:10.395 --> 02:22:15.497]  And we've already got so much anger and frustration and racial tensions being stirred up in our inner cities.
[02:22:16.198 --> 02:22:23.140]  And when things start getting really bad, the mainstream media is just pointing it toward Trump for how bad things are.
[02:22:23.500 --> 02:22:26.422]  I mean, our cities could just explode in chaos.
[02:22:26.682 --> 02:22:27.102]  That's right.
[02:22:27.142 --> 02:22:29.523]  We've had a 50-year rot of America.
[02:22:30.714 --> 02:22:35.459]  We have brought in giant third world populations that have no history of living in a free country or being upwardly mobile.
[02:22:35.479 --> 02:22:36.380]  They're put on welfare.
[02:22:36.680 --> 02:22:37.621]  They're made to be liberal.
[02:22:37.841 --> 02:22:39.603]  They're made to have chips on their shoulders right away.
[02:22:39.803 --> 02:22:45.809]  Trump is desperately trying to get jobs into the areas, desperately trying to create exuberance, trying to create a good attitude.
[02:22:45.830 --> 02:22:49.133]  Everybody knows with the dollar, you name it, it's all about confidence.
[02:22:49.173 --> 02:22:53.597]  And then the media is blaming him when he's desperately trying to right the ship.
[02:22:54.881 --> 02:22:56.242]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:22:56.522 --> 02:22:57.824]  You can't survive without it.
[02:22:58.024 --> 02:22:58.925]  But where do you get it?
[02:22:59.225 --> 02:23:04.990]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[02:23:05.210 --> 02:23:10.915]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.

[02:24:13.799 --> 02:24:15.681]  Dr. Shiva Ayodhya is our guest.
[02:24:15.721 --> 02:24:18.844]  He's got four degrees from MIT and others as well.
[02:24:18.984 --> 02:24:19.565]  Patriot.
[02:24:20.546 --> 02:24:25.030]  And he's running for Senate against the fake
[02:24:26.596 --> 02:24:35.905]  Native American, of course they thought they found Indians, so they called the Native Americans Indians, but he's actually an Indian, so he's the real Indian, running against the imposter, and he's kind of used that as one of his slogans.
[02:24:36.806 --> 02:24:44.293]  I want to continue getting into what's happening with science, and then after you leave us in a while, you know, obviously go to calls from folks that are holding, but
[02:24:45.509 --> 02:25:01.250]  Getting into the campaign to run against this lady, let's break down her record and what she's really up to and some of the things she's been involved in and what made you decide to go ahead and, you know, successful scientist, entrepreneur, to make you, you know, throw your hat in the ring.
[02:25:02.315 --> 02:25:07.240]  Well, you know, Alex, I grew up in, you know, I was originally born in India and I came here.
[02:25:07.641 --> 02:25:10.424]  As you may know, Alex, India has a very oppressive caste system.
[02:25:10.824 --> 02:25:23.117]  So my parents had this very futuristic vision and they made it out in there and they came to America because the founders of this country had a very different vision for America, which was through your hard work, through your bravery, through your resilience, you created things.
[02:25:23.157 --> 02:25:24.678]  And that's what this country is about.
[02:25:25.439 --> 02:25:31.803]  Well, and the idea of the Founders was that between us and our Creator was not supposed to be monarchs and nobles, the priesthood.
[02:25:32.104 --> 02:25:36.546]  It was about us having a direct connection to our God and our Creator, and that's what makes this country great.
[02:25:36.947 --> 02:25:46.613]  Elizabeth Warren and the self-serving elitists, Harvard and all these Ivy League institutions and the big institutions, fundamentally believe that they know better, Alex
[02:25:46.993 --> 02:25:49.354]  And I know you know better, I know we know better.
[02:25:49.754 --> 02:25:51.134]  But that's the fundamental reason.
[02:25:51.174 --> 02:26:03.738]  So my journey as an entrepreneur, scientist, engineer, has shown me that ultimately those people actually work for a living, produce things, entrepreneurs, people like yourself who create things, are the ones that make this country great.
[02:26:03.978 --> 02:26:09.539]  People like Elizabeth Warren, the establishment politicians of political hacks, they fundamentally add zero value.
[02:26:09.939 --> 02:26:12.760]  So I've been fortunate because of this great country, Alex,
[02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:16.743]  To have, you know, accumulated wealth, been able to get educated.
[02:26:16.783 --> 02:26:19.525]  I could not have done that in the oppressive caste system of India.
[02:26:19.545 --> 02:26:20.986]  So I believe I owe something back.
[02:26:21.046 --> 02:26:21.947]  I love this country.
[02:26:22.367 --> 02:26:25.870]  And Elizabeth Warren is what I call the not-so-obvious establishment.
[02:26:25.890 --> 02:26:34.016]  You know, when we look at the arc of political history, we have the establishment, the populist movement, those people on the streets wanting a better day for themselves and their family.
[02:26:34.336 --> 02:26:36.438]  Then you have the not-so-obvious establishment.
[02:26:36.818 --> 02:26:40.019]  Which is what Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, these people represent.
[02:26:40.299 --> 02:26:41.639]  They speak a good game.
[02:26:42.059 --> 02:26:45.240]  You know, as you talk about it, they're very, very clever with their PR.
[02:26:45.640 --> 02:26:47.040]  Revolution, hope, change.
[02:26:47.280 --> 02:26:51.941]  But fundamentally, they want to suck out the populist movement and drive it back to the establishment.
[02:26:52.381 --> 02:26:57.302]  So as a student of systems, as a student of science, I fundamentally want to stop these guys.
[02:26:57.362 --> 02:27:00.902]  And more importantly, I want to drive a massive defeat to Warren.
[02:27:00.922 --> 02:27:03.603]  And I know I can do this right here in Massachusetts.
[02:27:03.643 --> 02:27:04.003]  And I think
[02:27:04.423 --> 02:27:08.667]  The reality is, she's not just running for Senator, Alex, she's actually going after Trump.
[02:27:08.707 --> 02:27:11.230]  If we go to her webpage, it says, Stop Donald Trump.
[02:27:11.730 --> 02:27:16.635]  So, in my view, she's the face of what I call, in many ways, the not-so-obvious establishment.
[02:27:16.655 --> 02:27:18.056]  Oh, she's one of the top ringwraiths.
[02:27:18.236 --> 02:27:21.339]  She's really intending to probably even run for President.
[02:27:21.400 --> 02:27:23.341]  So, how do we get behind you?
[02:27:23.361 --> 02:27:28.707]  How do people support going after this key globalist posing as a leftist populist?
[02:27:29.522 --> 02:27:32.185]  I think the number one, you know, we have our website called Shiva for Senate.
[02:27:32.225 --> 02:27:34.328]  We're building this as a populist movement.
[02:27:34.568 --> 02:27:36.730]  We love whatever donations people want to give.
[02:27:36.750 --> 02:27:38.693]  We have volunteers that we want on the ground.
[02:27:38.953 --> 02:27:42.197]  You know, fundamentally, in Massachusetts, it's a two-part election, Alex.
[02:27:42.537 --> 02:27:48.144]  You have to win the primaries, and the establishment Republicans, frankly, make it very difficult.
[02:27:48.824 --> 02:27:49.925]  So you have to get delegates.
[02:27:49.965 --> 02:27:52.087]  So we're well on our way to doing that.
[02:27:52.127 --> 02:27:57.451]  As you know, a bunch of students and local citizens actually took an old bus and they gutted it for us.
[02:27:57.831 --> 02:27:59.372]  And we call it Real Indian One.
[02:27:59.712 --> 02:28:02.695]  And we're using that bus to go directly among people.
[02:28:03.255 --> 02:28:06.257]  And then we're obviously using social media, I think.
[02:28:06.277 --> 02:28:08.699]  But we have a phenomenal chance at winning.
[02:28:08.759 --> 02:28:11.261]  Kurt Schilling has supported our campaign.
[02:28:11.741 --> 02:28:13.763]  The Lowell Sun, a number of local newspapers.
[02:28:14.063 --> 02:28:17.746]  But the reality is the more we get out there, the more people hear my message, Alex.
[02:28:18.486 --> 02:28:24.971]  It's sort of game, set, match for Warren because she's going to have a difficult time calling me a racist or a white supremacist or stupid.
[02:28:25.292 --> 02:28:27.694]  So I'm really looking forward to going head on head with her, Alex.
[02:28:27.994 --> 02:28:29.575]  And I look forward to your guys getting the story out.
[02:28:29.595 --> 02:28:36.520]  Well, Yield Destroyer, come back for a full hour soon just to cover the waterfront and the history of your life because it's so interesting.
[02:28:36.541 --> 02:28:37.802]  I was already aware of some of your work.
[02:28:37.822 --> 02:28:39.163]  And then when I heard a few weeks ago,
[02:28:41.124 --> 02:28:44.306]  Owen came in here and said, you know, you're saying we should everybody to run for office against him.
[02:28:44.827 --> 02:28:46.628]  And here are some of the people I think are some of the best contenders.
[02:28:46.648 --> 02:28:49.610]  I was like, wow, that's really cool that he's running against Elizabeth Warren.
[02:28:49.650 --> 02:28:51.151]  So I'm so glad you're here.
[02:28:51.292 --> 02:28:54.514]  Shiva4, just the number 4, senate.com.
[02:28:55.174 --> 02:28:56.695]  And again, we got about a minute left.
[02:28:57.356 --> 02:28:58.257]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[02:28:58.917 --> 02:29:07.581]  Well, I just want to say, Alex, I think, you know, when you look at what's happened with the history of journalism, as you know, you know, I invented the first email system as a 14-year-old kid.
[02:29:07.901 --> 02:29:08.701]  Didn't speak about it.
[02:29:08.721 --> 02:29:09.602]  I got the first U.S.
[02:29:09.622 --> 02:29:10.802]  copyright five years ago.
[02:29:10.862 --> 02:29:11.822]  My mom was dying.
[02:29:12.503 --> 02:29:15.444]  She left a suitcase with all the artifacts that went into the Smithsonian.
[02:29:15.904 --> 02:29:22.467]  And then Gawker Media attempted to, a so-called mainstream media, pro-liberal publication, try to destroy the facts.
[02:29:22.947 --> 02:29:25.428]  We went after them after Hulk Hogan sued.
[02:29:25.709 --> 02:29:26.169]  We sued.
[02:29:26.209 --> 02:29:27.129]  We brought them down.
[02:29:27.429 --> 02:29:31.232]  I got about a million dollar payout and they were forced to take down their three articles.
[02:29:31.272 --> 02:29:32.552]  Same attorney, Charles Harder.
[02:29:32.992 --> 02:29:33.293]  Hold on.
[02:29:33.353 --> 02:29:34.013]  I was aware of that.
[02:29:34.033 --> 02:29:35.154]  I know I saw your name in the news.
[02:29:35.454 --> 02:29:37.295]  I know callers are holding, but just do a few more minutes with us.
[02:29:37.315 --> 02:29:37.855]  I know you're busy.
[02:29:38.135 --> 02:29:41.657]  Tell that story because it's so interesting about how nasty Gawker is.
[02:29:41.677 --> 02:29:42.157]  We'll be back.
[02:29:42.177 --> 02:29:42.598]  Stay with us.
[02:29:43.838 --> 02:29:44.719]  We're on the march.
[02:29:45.219 --> 02:29:46.820]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:47.760 --> 02:29:50.422]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:54.816 --> 02:30:02.579]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.
[02:30:02.799 --> 02:30:09.221]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[02:30:09.441 --> 02:30:17.724]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[02:30:18.004 --> 02:30:26.752]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene, Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[02:30:27.033 --> 02:30:32.758]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[02:30:33.098 --> 02:30:33.578]  It works.
[02:30:33.859 --> 02:30:42.183]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[02:30:42.323 --> 02:30:51.728]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarsTore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the globalists all at the same time.
[02:30:52.068 --> 02:30:52.568]  A total 360 win.
[02:30:54.833 --> 02:30:58.355]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[02:30:58.816 --> 02:31:04.860]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[02:31:05.280 --> 02:31:08.062]  It is the new t-shirt from infowarsstore.com.
[02:31:08.442 --> 02:31:11.464]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[02:31:11.664 --> 02:31:15.106]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[02:31:15.447 --> 02:31:15.907]  The left
[02:31:16.247 --> 02:31:17.188]  ...controls culture.
[02:31:17.208 --> 02:31:18.188]  They control art.
[02:31:18.248 --> 02:31:19.469]  They control entertainment.
[02:31:19.789 --> 02:31:26.874]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[02:31:26.914 --> 02:31:29.315]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[02:31:29.816 --> 02:31:33.678]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[02:31:33.718 --> 02:31:35.800]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate
[02:31:36.420 --> 02:31:41.784]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[02:31:42.044 --> 02:31:48.289]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[02:31:48.369 --> 02:31:50.071]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[02:31:50.231 --> 02:31:51.412]  It's available right now.
[02:31:51.732 --> 02:31:53.894]  Get yours at infowarsstore.com.
[02:31:54.727 --> 02:31:56.908]  We have two major problems in this country when it comes to spending.
[02:31:57.108 --> 02:31:59.849]  One is the warfare state, and the other is the welfare state.
[02:31:59.870 --> 02:32:04.592]  13 Alabama counties saw 85% drop in food stamp participation after work requirements reinstated.
[02:32:04.752 --> 02:32:05.272]  Go figure.
[02:32:05.372 --> 02:32:12.376]  So during the economic downturn between 2011 and 2013, several states, including Alabama, waived these SNAP work requirements in response to high unemployment.
[02:32:12.456 --> 02:32:16.838]  Alabama reinstated the work requirements for 54 counties on January 1st, 2016, and then for the remaining 13 on January 1st, 2017.
[02:32:19.659 --> 02:32:24.961]  Among those 13 counties, there were 5,538 adults ages 18 to 50 without dependents receiving food stamps.
[02:32:25.101 --> 02:32:28.783]  By May 1st of this year, that number had dropped to 831, a decline of 85%.
[02:32:29.663 --> 02:32:32.425]  Now remember, SNAP is essentially an electronic soup line.
[02:32:32.485 --> 02:32:36.106]  So we don't see people waiting in long lines to get food in soup kitchens, they get them on a debit card.
[02:32:36.146 --> 02:32:37.867]  Which is another way the government gets to control you.
[02:32:37.907 --> 02:32:42.829]  The Trump administration is about to cut food stamp rolls over the next decade, ensuring that able-bodied adult recipients are working.
[02:32:42.929 --> 02:32:44.450]  And Democrats were up in arms about this.
[02:32:44.490 --> 02:32:46.851]  But if you look at Alabama, you can see that it really does work.
[02:32:47.051 --> 02:32:51.753]  I'm all for helping people out if they need a hand, but I work and there's no reason why other able-bodied people can't get out there and do the same.
[02:32:51.853 --> 02:32:54.235]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:33:09.022 --> 02:33:15.265]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:24.887 --> 02:33:27.468]  Dr. Ayodhya Ray is our guest, or just Dr. Siva.
[02:33:27.968 --> 02:33:29.489]  First name, SivaPrasanna.com.
[02:33:30.029 --> 02:33:35.872]  Finishing up with your story, because I know they had systems at some universities and things that were similar, but you codified it.
[02:33:36.312 --> 02:33:42.255]  You put it, I guess, in a software that actually worked, and you've, you know, the Smithsonian does, you know, have that on display, because I've read about the case.
[02:33:43.035 --> 02:33:45.556]  But I'm going from memory with what happened.
[02:33:46.016 --> 02:33:48.818]  Gawker obviously sued into oblivion right now.
[02:33:50.398 --> 02:33:51.879]  There it is, the $750,000 Gawker settlement that could
[02:33:54.540 --> 02:34:01.866]  Alex, you know, in 1970 when I was a 14-year-old kid, you know, I had finished up calculus as a kid, worked hard, got a chance to go to NYU in a special sort of intensive computer science program.
[02:34:19.799 --> 02:34:29.691]  And because of the public school systems and great dedicated teachers, they changed the rules so I could work full-time at the University of Medicine Dentistry, Newark, what is now known as Rutgers.
[02:34:30.132 --> 02:34:38.082]  If you remember Alex, anyone over the age of 40 knows in those days, the way communication took place in organizations was through the inter-office paper-based mail system.
[02:34:38.322 --> 02:34:40.904]  You know, every secretary had in-box, out-box folders.
[02:34:41.344 --> 02:34:43.145]  They had the attachments.
[02:34:43.165 --> 02:34:48.869]  They'd write a thing called a memo with carbon paper, put it in an envelope, and send it around through these pneumatic tubes.
[02:34:49.189 --> 02:35:00.095]  That is the system, that entire system, Alex, I converted to the electronic version, 50,000 lines of code, called it email, a term never used before, and in fact got the first U.S.
[02:35:00.135 --> 02:35:03.998]  copyright at a time when copyright was the only way to protect software inventions.
[02:35:04.298 --> 02:35:05.839]  So the facts are black and white, Alan.
[02:35:06.119 --> 02:35:08.520]  I created email, called that email, put all the features in.
[02:35:08.980 --> 02:35:16.723]  Now, prior to that, people had the ability to exchange electronic messages between devices, dating all the way back to the Morse Code of the 1800s.
[02:35:17.344 --> 02:35:22.746]  I'm not claiming I'm the inventor of electronic messaging, Alan, but I invented email, the system as we know it today.
[02:35:23.006 --> 02:35:24.787]  And those facts are black and white.
[02:35:25.427 --> 02:35:26.748]  Now, I didn't talk about it.
[02:35:27.128 --> 02:35:30.769]  Five years ago, my mom was dying of pulmonary fibrosis in a suitcase.
[02:35:31.069 --> 02:35:34.171]  She left all the beautiful documents two months before she died.
[02:35:34.511 --> 02:35:43.174]  The senior editor of Time Magazine, Doug Ameth, went through this, probably the only journalist who spent time doing this, and he wrote an article called The Man Who Invented Email in November 2011.
[02:35:43.934 --> 02:35:45.415]  Then the Smithsonian wanted it.
[02:35:45.775 --> 02:35:51.357]  It went into the Smithsonian, Alex, and a young Washington Post reporter said Shiva Iyadri honored as the inventor of email.
[02:35:51.678 --> 02:35:54.699]  And that's when the proverbial, you know, shoot hit the fan.
[02:35:56.179 --> 02:35:57.940]  All the old guard historians.
[02:35:57.980 --> 02:36:02.881]  This was like as though a skull had been found in Africa and reset the origin of human history, Alan.
[02:36:03.161 --> 02:36:07.743]  So they went ape, not because of the fact I invented email, but what that meant.
[02:36:08.043 --> 02:36:14.265]  The fact is I was on the front page of MIT, which is part of the military industrial complex, as you know, Alex, for inventing many other things.
[02:36:14.645 --> 02:36:14.865]  Sure, sure.
[02:36:29.582 --> 02:36:40.886]  You reminded me of your case, and you won the case, and it's a fact, and just coming up with the name alone is amazing, but the 50,000 lines of code, and that's why the globals want a technocracy to surveil everything.
[02:36:41.206 --> 02:36:50.689]  They admit the NSA's main goal is to find these innovations, snap them up and control them, because they might be disruptive, and it might be something they don't want the general public to have.
[02:36:51.761 --> 02:36:52.401]  Exactly, Alex.
[02:36:52.421 --> 02:36:55.282]  And the fundamental thing is, you know, several years ago, the U.S.
[02:36:55.342 --> 02:36:57.842]  Postal Service hired me to help them out of their bankruptcy.
[02:36:58.103 --> 02:37:06.264]  And one of the things I pointed out was, you know, when the Postal Service was started, it was done by our founding father, so I could send you a letter and no one could intercede.
[02:37:06.284 --> 02:37:09.685]  And in fact, it's a 20-year prison sentence if someone does.
[02:37:10.025 --> 02:37:21.028]  What's happened with email after 93 is when Google, Hotmail, all these guys came in, they offered, quote-unquote, free email when it was basically waiting for us to relinquish our freedom.
[02:37:21.508 --> 02:37:25.630]  And I've argued that we have to go back to the basics of the Founding Fathers.
[02:37:26.050 --> 02:37:34.773]  Email, in some ways, should be under the purview of the Postal Service because at least we had laws that people, if they interceded, we had a way to adjudicate that.
[02:37:35.153 --> 02:37:38.354]  As of now, you know, Hotmail, Gmail, they own our email.
[02:37:38.634 --> 02:37:41.376]  This is a fundamental issue that people have not recognized.
[02:37:41.736 --> 02:37:43.756]  And they admit they're scanning it, they're reading it.
[02:37:44.277 --> 02:37:44.717]  Exactly.
[02:37:44.737 --> 02:37:47.578]  And then they would have MSM just say it's a conspiracy theory when it's a fact.
[02:37:48.385 --> 02:37:49.005]  Exactly.
[02:37:49.625 --> 02:37:53.906]  And that's why, you know, last year the New York Times interviewed me on the Hillary Clinton email issue.
[02:37:54.246 --> 02:38:10.430]  I mean, fundamentally, what she did was deniability, and it's mainly the have and have-nots, meaning what we're entering into is a world where the haves will have all the protection private servers, and the have-nots, like the rest of us, will have to use Gmail, Hotmail, etc., and be open to be scanning.
[02:38:10.450 --> 02:38:17.652]  That's why the Hillary Clinton issue is so significant, because she wanted deniability, where she could have a personal email server in her home,
[02:38:17.972 --> 02:38:22.616]  Take our emails, which is public emails, which is the State Department emails and own it.
[02:38:23.036 --> 02:38:26.119]  And it's still shocking to me that she has not been prosecuted.
[02:38:26.459 --> 02:38:27.080]  Exactly.
[02:38:27.100 --> 02:38:32.485]  She was stealing emails on a smaller scale than Google and Microsoft and all the rest of them.
[02:38:32.505 --> 02:38:35.147]  But at least they get you to sign a contract in terms of service.
[02:38:35.467 --> 02:38:36.889]  She was doing classified stuff.
[02:38:37.549 --> 02:38:42.677]  That's illegal at a whole other level, and then they're busy going after Donald Trump in closing, because you're an amazing guest.
[02:38:42.697 --> 02:38:44.620]  I'm going to get you back soon, but I'm going to go to these calls.
[02:38:45.221 --> 02:38:50.930]  Dr. Sheba running for Senate in Massachusetts against Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren, looking at this.
[02:38:52.392 --> 02:38:53.993]  What do you make of them coming after Trump?
[02:38:54.033 --> 02:38:55.975]  I mean, they genuinely hate him.
[02:38:56.075 --> 02:39:04.941]  I'm not trying to lionize him, but you can't help it when he's totally surrounded by traitors, being attacked from every angle, and still delivering, propping up the stock market.
[02:39:04.981 --> 02:39:06.062]  They admit he's the one that's done it.
[02:39:06.563 --> 02:39:09.184]  With the Democrats running around cheerleading for it to fall.
[02:39:09.645 --> 02:39:12.407]  I mean, they better get in some big trouble if they cause a depression.
[02:39:12.427 --> 02:39:15.349]  I mean, these people are just crazy.
[02:39:15.429 --> 02:39:16.270]  What is their problem?
[02:39:16.977 --> 02:39:21.278]  Well, well, Alan, I think, I mean, Alex, you hit it, my assistant's name is Alan.
[02:39:21.318 --> 02:39:26.500]  I get names all the wrong, I mean, go ahead, I don't care.
[02:39:26.600 --> 02:39:34.283]  Fundamentally, as you know, when you study political history, Trump's election was a necessary disruption to a corrupt system.
[02:39:34.663 --> 02:39:38.544]  And when, and he basically was like the shot being fought in Lexington.
[02:39:38.584 --> 02:39:41.105]  He basically fired the new shot of the new American revolution.
[02:39:41.505 --> 02:39:44.729]  And after a revolution, as we all know, you have the counter-revolution.
[02:39:45.089 --> 02:39:48.293]  And that's what we're witnessing, a civil war is taking place right now.
[02:39:48.673 --> 02:39:52.618]  And that civil war is fundamentally to unseat Donald Trump.
[02:39:52.818 --> 02:39:58.304]  But I would like to lionize him, because in my opinion, he's a great man, a courageous man, a true patriot.
[02:39:58.525 --> 02:39:59.726]  He doesn't need to do this.
[02:39:59.886 --> 02:40:01.148]  And I know this as an entrepreneur.
[02:40:01.488 --> 02:40:04.029]  I mean, I have a multi-billion dollar new startup I've started.
[02:40:04.149 --> 02:40:06.229]  I don't need to do this, but I love this country.
[02:40:06.569 --> 02:40:07.929]  Donald Trump loves this country.
[02:40:07.969 --> 02:40:09.250]  I know you love this country.
[02:40:09.550 --> 02:40:23.633]  And it's time that we as patriots recognized and we came together to defend our president because these elitist academics, they are basically furious, not about Donald Trump, because they lost control over those people who they called rednecks.
[02:40:24.053 --> 02:40:25.694]  You know, those people who they thought are stupid.
[02:40:25.934 --> 02:40:28.115]  That's who they really do not like.
[02:40:28.375 --> 02:40:33.138]  You know, I was living out in Hollywood for several years, as Owen may know.
[02:40:33.698 --> 02:40:38.000]  One of the great people I did meet in Hollywood is a great actor by the name of Pierce Brosnan.
[02:40:38.301 --> 02:40:43.083]  Pierce and his wife have put their money on the line, and they've done a great movie called Poisoning Paradise.
[02:40:43.403 --> 02:40:49.246]  I'm one of the scientists featured in it, talking about what's going on to the destruction of Kauai, the half of the island.
[02:40:49.406 --> 02:40:49.647]  Oh, wow.
[02:40:50.827 --> 02:40:59.394]  Which, as you talk about, the military industrial complex has polluted for years, has used it as a testing ground for a lot of the pesticides, etc.
[02:40:59.755 --> 02:41:02.937]  So what I recognize is we're in a very interesting point in human history.
[02:41:02.957 --> 02:41:08.902]  You have basically certain angels coming out in good ways, and it's a disruptive environment.
[02:41:08.922 --> 02:41:10.223]  So it's a very exciting environment.
[02:41:10.503 --> 02:41:13.646]  And I think people like MIT are probably horrified that they gave me those four degrees.
[02:41:13.746 --> 02:41:22.608]  Let me just say this, I want to get you on routinely, because I just love talking, this guy is so smart, just all these subjects, he's just bam, bam, bam.
[02:41:22.928 --> 02:41:24.068]  We need you as a U.S.
[02:41:24.108 --> 02:41:24.468]  Senator.
[02:41:24.508 --> 02:41:26.348]  And think about that too, that's what I was just going to say.
[02:41:26.428 --> 02:41:29.269]  So you've got, you've got Sheva running against Elizabeth Warren.
[02:41:29.309 --> 02:41:34.950]  That's like a speck of dust, Elizabeth Warren, versus a cut diamond that you're ready to put on a ring.
[02:41:34.970 --> 02:41:35.470]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:41:35.490 --> 02:41:36.790]  I mean, this shouldn't even be a race.
[02:41:36.850 --> 02:41:39.190]  I mean, I'm not trying to, you know, lionize you, Dr. Sheva.
[02:41:39.210 --> 02:41:39.510]  That's true.
[02:41:39.550 --> 02:41:41.531]  Elizabeth Warren has made nothing, built nothing.
[02:41:41.551 --> 02:41:43.051]  She's a bumbling, lying idiot.
[02:41:43.251 --> 02:41:49.954]  Look at this guy, look at Dr. Shiva's resume compared to Elizabeth Warren who claims she, who lies to get into college about her heritage.
[02:41:50.295 --> 02:41:52.716]  This is a speck of dust versus a diamond.
[02:41:52.956 --> 02:41:56.918]  That's why these self-serving elitists, I call them, you know, they know how to cut in line.
[02:41:56.958 --> 02:41:57.678]  I mean, think about it.
[02:41:57.738 --> 02:42:01.220]  For her to mark off she was a Native American is cutting in line.
[02:42:01.520 --> 02:42:03.921]  The same aspect of allowing illegal aliens.
[02:42:03.981 --> 02:42:06.142]  And you know, my father came here legally.
[02:42:06.403 --> 02:42:08.964]  We had to wait a year to come to this great country legally.
[02:42:09.284 --> 02:42:14.329]  So their concept is they have their own rules for themselves, and we, everyone else, has their own rules.
[02:42:14.589 --> 02:42:18.853]  They don't like to build a wall, but the reality is every cell in the human body has a wall.
[02:42:18.873 --> 02:42:20.574]  You know, the atmosphere has a wall.
[02:42:21.395 --> 02:42:24.838]  Nature, in its divine design, puts walls around things.
[02:42:24.858 --> 02:42:25.659]  The universe is a wall.
[02:42:25.959 --> 02:42:27.400]  Bilderberg is a wall.
[02:42:27.601 --> 02:42:27.881]  Right.
[02:42:28.201 --> 02:42:37.150]  So these people don't want to follow nature's laws when it comes to them, yet they want us to come up with their own ridiculous issues.
[02:42:37.170 --> 02:42:41.674]  And as you said, Alan, is people like Elizabeth Warren need to be stopped.
[02:42:41.994 --> 02:42:56.989]  And I believe that I was, you know, in many ways, my hard-working grandparents and my parents and this great country and the fathers of this country put me and gave me this opportunity at this point in history to stop someone like Warren to basically support this new American revolution.
[02:42:57.289 --> 02:42:58.030]  Well, it's exciting.
[02:42:58.150 --> 02:42:59.331]  Dr. Seema, thank you so much.
[02:42:59.351 --> 02:43:00.032]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:43:01.308 --> 02:43:02.670]  Thanks Alex, look forward to being on.
[02:43:20.689 --> 02:43:22.211]  Maxine Waters is part of that swamp.
[02:43:22.251 --> 02:43:28.939]  I think we have another member of the swamp who identified himself today during these Russia-Trump hearings, and that's a Democrat out of New Mexico.
[02:43:28.959 --> 02:43:29.940]  I think his name was Heinrich.
[02:43:30.200 --> 02:43:31.141]  So guess what, Heinrich?
[02:43:31.181 --> 02:43:37.869]  Now you're in my political sightlines, and we're coming after you, and we're going to find out who's running against you, and you're going to lose your seat.
[02:43:38.169 --> 02:43:42.851]  But real quick, Alex, before I let you take these great callers, I just want to have a couple quick points on everything Dr. Shiva said.
[02:43:42.911 --> 02:43:47.773]  First, he made a great point about Democrats and liberals want to put the government in between you and your God.
[02:43:48.033 --> 02:43:50.194]  They want to put the government in between you and your dreams.
[02:43:50.414 --> 02:43:52.515]  They want to put the government in between you and your goals.
[02:43:52.876 --> 02:43:54.436]  No, this is America.
[02:43:54.776 --> 02:43:58.538]  We have the direct contact with our dreams, direct contact with our God.
[02:43:58.618 --> 02:43:59.679]  We decide our own destiny.
[02:43:59.739 --> 02:44:00.479]  I love that point.
[02:44:00.999 --> 02:44:03.000]  He wins his lawsuit against Gawker.
[02:44:03.020 --> 02:44:05.461]  Just another example of victory after victory after victory.
[02:44:05.801 --> 02:44:07.002]  I'm not tired of winning yet.
[02:44:07.702 --> 02:44:12.125]  He makes another great point about how the establishment in the media and politics thinks we're stupid.
[02:44:12.465 --> 02:44:13.526]  I mean, they really do, Alex.
[02:44:14.027 --> 02:44:17.689]  I mean, look, we're not going to go down the Megyn Kelly road, but she thinks we're stupid.
[02:44:17.749 --> 02:44:20.731]  She really thinks that she is a higher intellectual person than me.
[02:44:20.991 --> 02:44:21.872]  She's not even close.
[02:44:22.232 --> 02:44:24.254]  And then you have... You got kind of a big argument with her.
[02:44:24.274 --> 02:44:25.555]  I didn't get an argument with her.
[02:44:25.575 --> 02:44:27.376]  I mean, I threw a couple jabs at her.
[02:44:27.416 --> 02:44:30.218]  She thought she could come in here and she thinks that we really think she's a big deal.
[02:44:30.298 --> 02:44:32.199]  I really couldn't care less about Megyn Kelly, to be honest.
[02:44:32.259 --> 02:44:32.680]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:44:32.700 --> 02:44:33.881]  I don't even want to be mean to her.
[02:44:34.341 --> 02:44:36.082]  The point is... She was mean to you, though, Alex.
[02:44:36.102 --> 02:44:37.163]  Don't forget what she did to you.
[02:44:37.463 --> 02:44:37.963]  Oh, I know.
[02:44:37.983 --> 02:44:45.626]  The point was, she was like, oh, you're coming to do the Pizzagate and the Chobani Yogurt and the rest of it, and Newtown.
[02:44:46.127 --> 02:44:48.988]  That's just the thing they hammer on, like it's some defeat for us or whatever.
[02:44:49.688 --> 02:44:50.788]  And she goes, oh, no, no, no.
[02:44:50.808 --> 02:44:52.109]  Or Gay Frogs, which is provable.
[02:44:52.209 --> 02:44:54.610]  And then constantly, that's all it was for hours.
[02:44:54.630 --> 02:44:56.311]  She'd ask the same question like five times.
[02:44:57.131 --> 02:44:59.672]  They interviewed me basically all day long.
[02:44:59.772 --> 02:45:01.993]  For an 11-hour piece, or 11-minute piece.
[02:45:02.053 --> 02:45:03.834]  And I just felt completely empty at the end of it.
[02:45:04.354 --> 02:45:06.615]  And so that's why I don't do those interviews, is because
[02:45:07.415 --> 02:45:09.117]  Well, Alex, don't feel empty, Alex.
[02:45:09.137 --> 02:45:09.958]  You did the right thing.
[02:45:10.058 --> 02:45:14.622]  I'm telling you though, she is like, she ought to be in the new Blade Runner as a replicant robot.
[02:45:15.463 --> 02:45:16.243]  I'm not being mean.
[02:45:16.524 --> 02:45:21.188]  I'm like this fat toad creature, but I mean, she is like, I don't want to get into her anymore.
[02:45:21.228 --> 02:45:22.409]  We got to go to these callers, okay?
[02:45:22.429 --> 02:45:24.031]  Just can I make one more point for the callers?
[02:45:24.291 --> 02:45:25.452]  And I want to hear your take on this.
[02:45:25.893 --> 02:45:29.956]  Reality winner is looking at jail, 10 years, espionage for the leak that she puts.
[02:45:30.237 --> 02:45:31.157]  What about Hillary Clinton?
[02:45:31.997 --> 02:45:33.038]  What about Hillary Clinton?
[02:45:33.298 --> 02:45:36.499]  The same statute that they're saying reality winner violated.
[02:45:36.719 --> 02:45:39.061]  Hillary Clinton did the exact same thing, Alex.
[02:45:39.081 --> 02:45:39.881]  That's all I'm going to say.
[02:45:39.901 --> 02:45:40.401]  Take the call.
[02:45:40.561 --> 02:45:45.444]  And she's another person that says white genocide and they're always white.
[02:45:46.320 --> 02:45:50.905]  And then she's just some spoiled brat, works for the federal government, and reportedly is leaking stuff.
[02:45:51.285 --> 02:45:53.827]  And what she leaked, Trump hadn't even done anything wrong.
[02:45:53.847 --> 02:45:54.288]  It's nothing.
[02:45:54.348 --> 02:45:55.369]  It's a report on nothing.
[02:45:56.010 --> 02:46:03.136]  But that's the issue is whistleblowing is protected when you're exposing illegal activity, not when you're just leaking everything to try to hurt the country.
[02:46:04.048 --> 02:46:14.974]  It was a political smear attempt on Trump, and if she was smart, she would have known that what she was leaking doesn't actually carry any weight, doesn't have any water, it's just a report, it's not even intelligence.
[02:46:14.994 --> 02:46:17.315]  Alright, I've got to go to Jeff in New Jersey.
[02:46:17.336 --> 02:46:19.297]  He just came back from Paris, he's been holding patiently.
[02:46:19.957 --> 02:46:22.618]  Talk about what's happening there with all the jihad attacks and the rest of it.
[02:46:22.658 --> 02:46:24.960]  What did you see in Paris?
[02:46:25.080 --> 02:46:25.900]  Jeff, thank you for holding.
[02:46:25.920 --> 02:46:28.502]  No problem, thank you for having me on.
[02:46:29.366 --> 02:46:31.186]  Well, I just wanted to say that I came back from Paris.
[02:46:31.206 --> 02:46:33.707]  I was also in Basel and Zurich in Switzerland.
[02:46:33.947 --> 02:46:37.828]  And things are not looking too good, I must say.
[02:46:37.848 --> 02:46:39.788]  My sister, she teaches at the University of the Sorbonne.
[02:46:39.808 --> 02:46:41.169]  She's promoting your videos.
[02:46:41.189 --> 02:46:42.589]  By the way, you're burning up like crazy.
[02:46:42.609 --> 02:46:43.429]  You're very popular.
[02:46:43.449 --> 02:46:44.969]  They're very popular in Switzerland, by the way.
[02:46:46.030 --> 02:46:56.892]  And to say that, you know, what happened with the... It's gotten worse, obviously, with the migrants coming from the Middle East and Africa, through New Zealand and all that.
[02:46:58.010 --> 02:46:59.571]  It's just a mess.
[02:46:59.631 --> 02:47:02.352]  It's just a total disaster.
[02:47:02.672 --> 02:47:07.695]  And I just wanted to say that, you know, I don't know what's going to happen.
[02:47:07.735 --> 02:47:09.756]  And I really do feel bad for a country like Switzerland.
[02:47:09.776 --> 02:47:11.276]  It's a country I grew up for part of my life.
[02:47:11.296 --> 02:47:18.940]  It's a country that, through a lot of neutrality, has been a bulwark against the New World Order, against the tyrannical Habsburgs, Napoleon, and all that stuff.
[02:47:19.340 --> 02:47:21.641]  And they're armed.
[02:47:21.741 --> 02:47:24.883]  They've only joined the U.N.
[02:47:25.003 --> 02:47:27.084]  about 20 years ago, and I don't think they're even happy about it.
[02:47:27.822 --> 02:47:29.663]  And it's just depressing to watch.
[02:47:29.683 --> 02:47:30.423]  It really is.
[02:47:31.023 --> 02:47:45.190]  Once, you know, Great Places, and the politicians, you can tell, they don't want to have, they just keep on putting out the propaganda that you see in our media, you see in their media, but they're a little more sly about it.
[02:47:46.350 --> 02:47:49.132]  They can be a little bit more, like our media, you can just tell they're lying.
[02:47:49.532 --> 02:47:56.435]  There, they kind of, you know, put it in, and they don't really, they, they're kind of, they mask it better.
[02:47:57.202 --> 02:47:58.744]  So I just wanted to talk about those things.
[02:48:10.384 --> 02:48:13.786]  You know, World War II, they're not entering globalism, but they're trying to force you into it.
[02:48:14.167 --> 02:48:32.099]  The good news is the Euro's finally falling apart, so hopefully we can go back to independent states, independent diversity, independent sovereignty with more firewalls or bulkheads, like in a ship, so in case one gets taken over by Hitler, there isn't just one EU for him to take over, which was a Nazi plan, by the way.
[02:48:32.660 --> 02:48:33.280]  So, great points.
[02:48:33.300 --> 02:48:34.401]  Thank you so much for holding, Jeff.
[02:48:34.961 --> 02:48:36.502]  Yeah, we've had crew in Paris.
[02:48:37.523 --> 02:48:38.623]  I see the reports of Paris.
[02:48:38.643 --> 02:48:41.204]  80% down the last decade.
[02:48:41.464 --> 02:48:44.185]  Half that, 80% loss just the last two or three years.
[02:48:44.605 --> 02:48:46.005]  I mean, it is, our crew was there.
[02:48:46.485 --> 02:48:47.586]  The beautiful areas.
[02:48:48.426 --> 02:48:51.887]  There are just people laying around, crapping all over the ground.
[02:48:52.407 --> 02:48:58.408]  I mean, it is just, when I was in Italy last year, it was unbelievable.
[02:48:58.888 --> 02:49:01.229]  There were just homeless people from the Middle East.
[02:49:02.389 --> 02:49:08.161]  Just everywhere, like there'd be one tree out on the sidewalk, there'd be like five guys under it.
[02:49:10.186 --> 02:49:11.866]  And just crapping on the side of the ground.
[02:49:11.886 --> 02:49:13.267]  I mean, what is going on?
[02:49:13.507 --> 02:49:16.928]  Alex, and I certainly do not wish that this would happen at all.
[02:49:16.948 --> 02:49:18.708]  I want to be very clear, but can you imagine?
[02:49:19.008 --> 02:49:26.930]  Do you think the narrative would have changed if during the Manchester attack it wasn't just civilians that died, but instead it was Ariana Grande that was a victim?
[02:49:27.170 --> 02:49:27.430]  Oh yeah.
[02:49:27.590 --> 02:49:28.170]  Could you imagine?
[02:49:28.190 --> 02:49:30.051]  Do you think the narrative would still be the same today?
[02:49:30.071 --> 02:49:33.752]  Do you think they'd still be preaching tolerance and open borders and it's not radical Islamic terror?
[02:49:34.092 --> 02:49:38.813]  But the thing is, the elites on purpose are imploding the Middle East and Africa.
[02:49:39.133 --> 02:49:39.353]  Right.
[02:49:39.593 --> 02:49:45.035]  And then into Italy, bringing not even women and kids.
[02:49:45.516 --> 02:49:50.197]  Used to, you'd bring women and kid refugees because you could assimilate them, even if they came from a barbarous place.
[02:49:50.377 --> 02:49:53.759]  No, the women, you stay back, we'll bring a bunch of crazy men.
[02:49:53.959 --> 02:50:01.202]  Or the men were actually fighting the resistance that was going on in the country, the actual war that was going on, so they wanted to stay behind and fight for their land.
[02:50:01.222 --> 02:50:01.982]  And got the women out.
[02:50:02.222 --> 02:50:02.883]  Got the women out.
[02:50:02.923 --> 02:50:03.885]  Nope, that's not the case.
[02:50:04.025 --> 02:50:05.006]  They're invading now.
[02:50:05.046 --> 02:50:06.088]  They're leaving the country.
[02:50:06.128 --> 02:50:07.230]  Because that's Muslim men.
[02:50:07.250 --> 02:50:12.377]  I mean, they're leaving their women, like their dogs, and you know, they're coming to the happy hunting land.
[02:50:12.397 --> 02:50:15.422]  And then they find the Swedish girls bent over saying, let's go.
[02:50:15.622 --> 02:50:16.143]  Co-exist.
[02:50:16.223 --> 02:50:16.844]  Totally liberal.
[02:50:17.065 --> 02:50:17.505]  Please write me.
[02:50:18.246 --> 02:50:18.767]  That's in the news.
[02:50:18.787 --> 02:50:23.150]  They say, please, I guess it's not rape, you just, except then they go, wait a minute, 20 guys are gonna do this?
[02:50:23.211 --> 02:50:28.355]  No, I guess the wristband, remember they tried the wristbands that said, please don't rape me, those didn't work, so I guess now they're just gonna take it.
[02:50:28.495 --> 02:50:31.758]  But it's like someone's writing a dark satire book.
[02:50:32.439 --> 02:50:34.460]  This is like 10 times what Kurt Vonnegut would ever write.
[02:50:34.500 --> 02:50:36.582]  This is so ridiculous.
[02:50:36.923 --> 02:50:38.124]  I mean, what is it?
[02:50:38.824 --> 02:50:39.585]  It's mental illness.
[02:50:40.406 --> 02:50:42.447]  It's mental illness in mass.
[02:50:43.547 --> 02:50:44.047]  Worldwide.
[02:50:44.268 --> 02:50:44.768]  All right, folks.
[02:50:44.788 --> 02:50:47.811]  We're gonna come back and we're gonna go to... Who's been holding the longest?
[02:50:48.291 --> 02:50:48.552]  Ian.
[02:50:48.712 --> 02:50:49.633]  Ian, thank you for holding.
[02:50:49.993 --> 02:50:53.356]  I'm gonna go right to you, then Jason in Germany, Carlos, John, and others.
[02:50:53.836 --> 02:50:54.237]  Stay with us.
[02:50:59.290 --> 02:51:04.856]  Does your shampoo leave your scalp itchy and your hair dry and frizzy?

[02:51:32.115 --> 02:51:37.978]  Antiseptic herbs that have demonstrated antimicrobial activity are used.
[02:51:38.378 --> 02:51:39.719]  Go natural.
[02:51:40.139 --> 02:51:41.400]  Go organic.

[02:52:49.411 --> 02:52:57.696]  Well, I gotta tell you, Millie Weaver and her great accomplice in patriotic crime against the New World Order, Gavin, aren't just amazing researchers and reporters.
[02:52:58.157 --> 02:53:00.858]  They're also really, really good at shooting commercials.
[02:53:01.299 --> 02:53:10.445]  I mean, that thing looks like some million-dollar Hollywood commercial, and they shot that right here in Austin, Texas, to support the broadcast, without me even asking them to do it.
[02:53:10.905 --> 02:53:16.949]  And that's because Millie is really into high-quality organic shampoo, body wash, things like that.
[02:53:17.489 --> 02:53:23.632]  And she tried Emmerich's Essentials and just thought that it was amazing, so she had the idea with Gavin to produce the ad you just saw.
[02:53:23.692 --> 02:53:27.693]  But believe me, the product is just as good as the cover.
[02:53:28.134 --> 02:53:33.236]  You'll find Emmerich's Essentials at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:53:36.297 --> 02:53:39.699]  And again, I'd like to thank the listeners and the viewers for their ongoing support.
[02:53:39.939 --> 02:53:41.440]  Without you, there would be no InfoWar.
[02:53:41.801 --> 02:53:44.683]  And I'd like to thank Millie and Gavin for really going the extra mile.
[02:53:44.703 --> 02:53:48.265]  I think this is one of the best commercials I've ever seen, and I'm really proud that it's ours.
[02:53:48.925 --> 02:53:54.029]  So again, folks, find out why Emirates Essentials has so many people really giving it five-star reviews.
[02:54:07.563 --> 02:54:11.965]  By the way, if there's one thing I'd drop the ball on, it's Infowars.com.
[02:54:12.846 --> 02:54:14.467]  We have such amazing in-house writers.
[02:54:14.627 --> 02:54:20.270]  We have other great writers that write for us, like Clifford Cunningham, who visited last week, and Dan Lyman.
[02:54:20.890 --> 02:54:23.791]  They just broke two big bombshell stories.
[02:54:24.452 --> 02:54:28.534]  But I've got to go to your calls, so we'll have to maybe get to these next hour when Roger Stone's coming in.
[02:54:29.134 --> 02:54:29.855]  But A.G.
[02:54:29.955 --> 02:54:33.857]  Sessions ends Obama's DOJ slush fund for far-left groups.
[02:54:35.097 --> 02:54:38.760]  They were getting that money out of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and other areas.
[02:54:39.601 --> 02:54:42.143]  Notice, InfoWars began this investigation four months ago.
[02:54:42.663 --> 02:54:43.504]  Now it's all confirmed.
[02:54:43.724 --> 02:54:44.524]  Real action.
[02:54:45.525 --> 02:54:48.528]  And what's crazy is it's the articles like this that don't get a lot of attention.
[02:54:49.738 --> 02:54:50.578]  that are big in D.C.
[02:55:09.824 --> 02:55:11.304]  To then expose it and it's all there.
[02:55:11.364 --> 02:55:15.705]  They tell us where to look with stuff that's open source but not known.
[02:55:16.005 --> 02:55:17.746]  Well, they know the mainstream news won't report on it.
[02:55:17.946 --> 02:55:20.686]  Yeah, so they come to us and here it is, AG Sessions.
[02:55:20.706 --> 02:55:24.007]  So Trump's been mad at him because, you know, he's like, they're criminals, go after him.
[02:55:24.027 --> 02:55:25.347]  And then he's like, but that'll look political.
[02:55:25.567 --> 02:55:26.428]  Trump's like, I don't care.
[02:55:26.728 --> 02:55:27.408]  You know, it's true.
[02:55:27.548 --> 02:55:29.388]  They're coming after him for nothing, go after him.
[02:55:29.648 --> 02:55:30.669]  But this is a big move.
[02:55:30.689 --> 02:55:31.749]  That's on Infowars.com.
[02:55:31.769 --> 02:55:32.129]  Here's another one.
[02:55:33.456 --> 02:55:37.083]  Global is to push EU flags, EU teams at 2024 Olympics.
[02:55:37.244 --> 02:55:41.772]  They've already started saying the new teams can't be named the French this or the Spanish that.
[02:55:43.066 --> 02:55:43.286]  We're good
[02:56:03.900 --> 02:56:09.982]  24 Olympics Games, which are likely to be held in Paris, has the opportunity to consolidate power and solidarity with the bloc.
[02:56:10.022 --> 02:56:12.223]  See, you can't have nation-states in solidarity.
[02:56:12.463 --> 02:56:15.924]  We'll talk about that later in the next hour, briefly, because I'm going right to Ian and others.
[02:56:17.485 --> 02:56:20.106]  Super Blue is our number one best-selling product.
[02:56:20.526 --> 02:56:22.387]  It doesn't count as a supplement or a nutraceutical.
[02:56:23.419 --> 02:56:26.562]  I mean, I've made the joke with the media demonizing our products, calling them snake oil.
[02:56:26.902 --> 02:56:36.750]  Oh, is our super high quality organic shampoo or healthy zinc-based oxide sunscreen or healthy essential oil-based bug spray?
[02:56:36.830 --> 02:56:38.291]  I mean, is that fake too?
[02:56:38.772 --> 02:56:42.395]  Because Emrix Essentials is one of the top brands in the country.
[02:56:43.115 --> 02:56:44.036]  Sold at Whole Foods.
[02:56:44.236 --> 02:56:45.277]  Private label by us.
[02:56:45.457 --> 02:56:46.018]  Discounted.
[02:56:46.038 --> 02:56:48.240]  25% off when you sign up for AutoShip.
[02:56:48.780 --> 02:56:50.983]  20% off if you don't, just off of retail.
[02:56:51.343 --> 02:56:52.484]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:56:52.504 --> 02:56:53.325]  But Super Blue!
[02:56:54.766 --> 02:56:56.388]  Can't keep it in stock, it's so popular.
[02:56:57.028 --> 02:56:58.029]  It's got colloidal silver.
[02:56:58.129 --> 02:56:59.411]  It's got iodine.
[02:56:59.711 --> 02:57:00.752]  It's got the nano silver.
[02:57:00.872 --> 02:57:02.534]  It's got no fluoride.
[02:57:02.574 --> 02:57:03.494]  It's got the tea tree oil.
[02:57:03.655 --> 02:57:04.255]  It's back!
[02:57:04.896 --> 02:57:06.778]  With a new, even more high-tech label.
[02:57:07.557 --> 02:57:09.398]  My dad originally did the label and everything, which is pretty good.
[02:57:09.418 --> 02:57:09.999]  He's a dentist.
[02:57:10.039 --> 02:57:11.080]  But I said, let's go further.
[02:57:11.120 --> 02:57:12.681]  Let's kind of update it a bit.
[02:57:13.121 --> 02:57:14.302]  People probably won't like it as much now.
[02:57:14.322 --> 02:57:20.767]  But the point is, that's available at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:57:21.088 --> 02:57:23.229]  But listen, selenium deficiency.
[02:57:23.289 --> 02:57:24.710]  Selenium is just like the iodine.
[02:57:24.750 --> 02:57:25.471]  Electrochemical.
[02:57:25.791 --> 02:57:26.852]  Gotta have it to live.
[02:57:27.332 --> 02:57:28.814]  Depleted in most of the supplies.
[02:57:29.374 --> 02:57:30.735]  Most of the vitamins are synthetic.
[02:57:30.775 --> 02:57:31.856]  This is from mustard seed.
[02:57:32.276 --> 02:57:33.277]  It's super strong.
[02:57:33.817 --> 02:57:35.279]  But I will tell you, you can look this up.
[02:57:35.819 --> 02:57:38.080]  Take too much of it, it'll make your hair fall out.
[02:57:38.680 --> 02:57:38.940]  Men.
[02:57:38.960 --> 02:57:40.441]  Because it boosts everything.
[02:57:41.081 --> 02:57:41.381]  Okay?
[02:57:41.762 --> 02:57:42.542]  I can't help it, though.
[02:57:42.582 --> 02:57:48.284]  It's like taking, you know, four cups of coffee or a speed pill or something, you know?
[02:57:48.324 --> 02:57:51.746]  I mean, it is crazy what this stuff does.
[02:57:51.846 --> 02:57:56.648]  And that's my secret weapon, is the X2 and the Selenium.
[02:57:57.526 --> 02:57:58.827]  But selenium is hardcore.
[02:57:58.947 --> 02:57:59.508]  It's serious.
[02:57:59.688 --> 02:58:00.208]  Read about it.
[02:58:00.308 --> 02:58:01.669]  Find out why it's so powerful.
[02:58:02.010 --> 02:58:03.431]  Find out why we get a true organic form.
[02:58:03.451 --> 02:58:04.071]  It's a game-changer.
[02:58:04.332 --> 02:58:07.194]  Get it for $14 in a big, old, high-quality glass bottle.
[02:58:07.554 --> 02:58:08.175]  Fill to the brim.
[02:58:08.195 --> 02:58:11.878]  Because we're able to get really good organic selenium at a very low price.
[02:58:11.918 --> 02:58:13.919]  The stuff that we can get at a low price, very low price for you.
[02:58:14.420 --> 02:58:15.000]  25% off.
[02:58:15.060 --> 02:58:16.942]  Infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:58:16.982 --> 02:58:20.645]  Roger Stone's a little bit late getting into his studio.
[02:58:20.685 --> 02:58:21.185]  That's fine.
[02:58:21.225 --> 02:58:22.346]  You know I love to take over.
[02:58:22.907 --> 02:58:24.968]  So, when we come back, we're going to
[02:58:26.284 --> 02:58:29.849]  Ian, in 70 seconds, when we come back on Trump's policies.
[02:58:29.889 --> 02:58:31.512]  Then John, fanning Sharia law.
[02:58:31.572 --> 02:58:32.453]  Carlos on Trump.
[02:58:32.773 --> 02:58:33.675]  Jason in Germany.
[02:58:33.735 --> 02:58:34.215]  Stay with us.
[02:58:34.836 --> 02:58:36.579]  Thank you for listening to GCS.
[02:58:36.779 --> 02:58:37.260]  Spread the link.
[02:58:37.901 --> 02:58:38.862]  Infowars.com.
[02:58:38.882 --> 02:58:40.344]  The enemy hates it.
[02:58:40.524 --> 02:58:41.425]  The enemy hates it.
[02:58:41.486 --> 02:58:42.928]  It's coffin nails to the enemy.
[02:58:44.232 --> 02:58:48.617]  We have the new product at Infowarsandlife.com, BioTrue Selenium.
[02:58:48.697 --> 02:58:59.650]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium, and just recently, we were able to source a certified organic, bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[02:58:59.810 --> 02:59:04.732]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your body.
[02:59:04.852 --> 02:59:07.373]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[02:59:07.433 --> 02:59:08.914]  It helps detoxify.
[02:59:08.934 --> 02:59:11.975]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[02:59:12.015 --> 02:59:16.777]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used all over the body.
[02:59:16.797 --> 02:59:23.019]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[02:59:23.039 --> 02:59:28.362]  So it really is an all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[02:59:28.382 --> 02:59:29.142]  I'm taking it now.
[02:59:29.502 --> 02:59:32.603]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[02:59:56.051 --> 03:00:02.377]  I've got a tiger by the tail to explain the scene.
[03:00:02.457 --> 03:00:06.660]  I won't be much when you get through with me.
[03:00:06.760 --> 03:00:08.862]  He never gives up.
[03:00:08.982 --> 03:00:15.347]  He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[03:00:15.407 --> 03:00:21.833]  Well, I thought the day I met you, you were meek as a lamb.
[03:00:23.058 --> 03:00:25.801]  Egan, Nevada, thank you for holding your Real Trooper.
[03:00:25.981 --> 03:00:26.882]  Thank you.
[03:00:27.944 --> 03:00:29.806]  Go ahead.
[03:00:29.866 --> 03:00:31.808]  Hello?
[03:00:31.888 --> 03:00:32.629]  Am I on the air?
[03:00:32.669 --> 03:00:33.029]  You are.
[03:00:33.089 --> 03:00:33.710]  Thank you for holding.
[03:00:33.730 --> 03:00:34.090]  Go ahead.
[03:00:34.110 --> 03:00:36.753]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[03:00:36.813 --> 03:00:37.494]  It's a pleasure.
[03:00:37.734 --> 03:00:39.897]  I'm on Trump's policies.
[03:00:40.931 --> 03:00:48.159]  I think he needs to go after the Bushes and the Clintons before they can actually run against him in 2020.
[03:00:48.879 --> 03:00:59.791]  And then he needs to do what he can to stop the globalists from enforcing their policies by taking away all their ability to enforce it, like going after their
[03:01:01.799 --> 03:01:09.903]  Well, I think the answer is we take control of all those satellites and things.
[03:01:09.983 --> 03:01:18.348]  But, I mean, what do you think of Sessions, this is just now breaking, taking away Obama's DOJ slush fund for far-left cop-killer groups and stuff?
[03:01:19.048 --> 03:01:19.688]  That's what's crazy.
[03:01:19.968 --> 03:01:22.350]  The DOJ was literally stealing billions.
[03:01:23.257 --> 03:01:29.642]  Out of the Fannie Mae Freddie Mac banking fund, to give it to literal terrorist organizations?
[03:01:29.702 --> 03:01:30.623]  For non-citizens.
[03:01:31.503 --> 03:01:32.584]  I mean, it's just, it's incredible.
[03:01:32.604 --> 03:01:33.485]  They've all got to be arrested.
[03:01:33.645 --> 03:01:34.686]  While the VA struggles.
[03:01:35.186 --> 03:01:36.347]  Ian, I appreciate your call.
[03:01:36.367 --> 03:01:37.047]  It's a great point.
[03:01:38.008 --> 03:01:39.569]  Let's talk to Carlos in Canada.
[03:01:39.589 --> 03:01:40.510]  Carlos, you're on the air.
[03:01:40.530 --> 03:01:43.092]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:01:43.832 --> 03:01:45.974]  I echo the sentiments of Jerome Corsi.
[03:01:46.014 --> 03:01:51.198]  I believe President Trump, right now, should really listen to his kind of advice.
[03:01:51.238 --> 03:01:52.319]  It's very, very important.
[03:01:52.984 --> 03:02:00.609]  Also, there are two meetings that will probably take place before the presidency of Donald Trump ends.
[03:02:01.149 --> 03:02:04.871]  One of them, I believe, will be relating to the Federal Reserve.
[03:02:05.832 --> 03:02:09.934]  President Trump must bring in the Federal Reserve Chairman
[03:02:10.592 --> 03:02:17.356]  And have a good, frank talk to say what was conceived in 1913 has become obsolete several years ago.
[03:02:17.857 --> 03:02:21.519]  It is a debt-based system that no longer serves the American public.
[03:02:21.559 --> 03:02:22.640]  Well, I mean, he knows that.
[03:02:22.700 --> 03:02:25.942]  Yellen supposedly is doing what he wants now, but I don't think that's enough.
[03:02:26.142 --> 03:02:27.343]  I think you should fire all of them.
[03:02:27.363 --> 03:02:27.803]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:02:29.352 --> 03:02:34.277]  Well, he shouldn't necessarily fire them because he can change bank accounts.
[03:02:34.337 --> 03:02:36.659]  You know, it's a Federal Reserve Act.
[03:02:36.679 --> 03:02:38.200]  Well, think about how powerful the President is.
[03:02:38.260 --> 03:02:40.142]  He's the only guy that has anything to do with that.
[03:02:40.803 --> 03:02:41.564]  And it's private.
[03:02:42.084 --> 03:02:43.165]  And only a President can kill it.
[03:02:43.185 --> 03:02:44.106]  That's why they're so scared.
[03:02:44.406 --> 03:02:46.328]  Just like the President does the FBI Director.
[03:02:46.388 --> 03:02:47.569]  He needs to take action.
[03:02:47.910 --> 03:02:49.771]  Well, then briefly, what should he do?
[03:02:50.392 --> 03:02:53.014]  Because right now, I know we're under a Federal Reserve System that's a fraud.
[03:02:53.575 --> 03:02:59.260]  But he should use it to flood money to the public, because we're in a stalled out position here, and then reform it from that point.
[03:02:59.280 --> 03:03:02.602]  I don't think you can reform it from a dead collapse position.
[03:03:02.963 --> 03:03:04.324]  Ron Paul agrees with that, by the way.
[03:03:04.484 --> 03:03:05.625]  He agrees with what Trump's doing.
[03:03:07.726 --> 03:03:11.469]  I agree, but there is a system called the public ban system.
[03:03:11.830 --> 03:03:13.711]  Several states have now begun to look at it.
[03:03:14.072 --> 03:03:19.456]  I think Senator Paul is aware of this.
[03:03:20.049 --> 03:03:38.481]  And if President Trump were to examine seriously each state by state creating a public bank to replace the federal government having to go to the Federal Reserve, but rather the states and the federal government go to the public bank system.
[03:03:38.862 --> 03:03:47.067]  The public bank system is very different because it doesn't, it is not like the Federal Reserve where, you know, it's a private entity.
[03:03:47.127 --> 03:03:49.709]  This would be a public entity belonging to all Americans.
[03:03:50.345 --> 03:03:52.266]  And it would be administered by the Treasury.
[03:03:52.286 --> 03:03:57.649]  No, Harry, I don't have a problem with a federal bank, if it is federal and totally transparent, like a state bank.
[03:03:57.969 --> 03:04:05.193]  State banks are great systems, built the country, and I'm all for credit to the little guy, and for it not to be discriminatory.
[03:04:05.873 --> 03:04:06.533]  Thanks for the call.
[03:04:06.573 --> 03:04:07.274]  You want to comment on that?
[03:04:08.151 --> 03:04:20.895]  Well, I think that the Federal Reserve is so out of control, just getting people to realize that there's a private banking entity behind it would just be the first step to trying to wrangle it back into our control.
[03:04:20.935 --> 03:04:24.776]  But I'm not sure if the Federal Reserve, Fractional Reserve banking system is even
[03:04:25.763 --> 03:04:27.924]  Is even a pliable option for the future, to be honest.
[03:04:28.024 --> 03:04:30.025]  I don't see how we could ever come out of this debt.
[03:04:30.445 --> 03:04:31.986]  Well, they're the ones running globalism.
[03:04:32.006 --> 03:04:34.406]  I mean, you look at the shareholders of the New York Fed.
[03:04:34.426 --> 03:04:35.327]  That's who really runs it all.
[03:04:35.947 --> 03:04:40.069]  It's mainly European banks that have been trying to take this country back since they lost it.
[03:04:40.209 --> 03:04:42.850]  But if anyone understands the finances like that, it's President Trump.
[03:04:43.030 --> 03:04:43.770]  It's not Obama.
[03:04:44.190 --> 03:04:44.851]  It's not Yellen.
[03:04:46.171 --> 03:04:50.013]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, more calls straight ahead, and then Roger Stone joins us.
[03:04:50.113 --> 03:04:50.533]  Stay with us.
[03:04:55.057 --> 03:04:58.399]  So what do you do when you're an overweight, pathetic filmmaker that is irrelevant?
[03:04:58.479 --> 03:05:01.420]  Well, you attempt to become relevant by making the president look bad.
[03:05:01.520 --> 03:05:06.183]  And that's the case with Michael Moore, who has launched Trumpy Leaks, a website for leftist leakers.
[03:05:06.483 --> 03:05:11.866]  Moore explained to the Huffington Post that it's his patriotic duty of Americans to fight against Trump.
[03:05:11.966 --> 03:05:15.107]  He also said, Donald Trump thinks he's above the law.
[03:05:15.447 --> 03:05:17.088]  He acts like he's above the law.
[03:05:17.168 --> 03:05:18.969]  He stated he's above the law.
[03:05:19.189 --> 03:05:20.610]  And I know this is risky.
[03:05:20.950 --> 03:05:22.391]  I know we may get in trouble.
[03:05:22.731 --> 03:05:25.213]  But too much is at stake to play it safe.
[03:05:25.473 --> 03:05:29.295]  And along with the founding fathers, I've got your back.
[03:05:29.656 --> 03:05:32.077]  Now, does anybody really believe Michael Moore has anyone's back?
[03:05:32.177 --> 03:05:37.220]  Basically, he's encouraging young impressionable kids who grew up watching his crappy documentaries into breaking the law.
[03:05:37.340 --> 03:05:42.524]  Take, for instance, SJW activist Reality Winner, who's the latest winner in the Trump leak sweepstakes.
[03:05:42.904 --> 03:05:46.311]  She was added in less than an hour after leaking an innocuous NSA document.
[03:05:46.531 --> 03:05:50.318]  Would it be a shame if we all went to Trumpy Leaks and sent a bunch of tips about Seth Rich's murder?
[03:05:50.399 --> 03:05:52.062]  Wow, do you think Michael Moore is really interested in that?
[03:05:52.142 --> 03:05:54.426]  Rob Dewey reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:05:56.522 --> 03:06:00.047]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and the t-shirt has finally arrived.
[03:06:00.508 --> 03:06:06.556]  Nothing triggers safe space snowflakes more than this slogan and my face.
[03:06:06.796 --> 03:06:09.760]  It is the new t-shirt from infowarsstore.com.
[03:06:10.141 --> 03:06:13.125]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[03:06:13.345 --> 03:06:16.788]  You've seen how much this triggers the safe space snowflakes.
[03:06:17.129 --> 03:06:18.870]  The left controls culture.
[03:06:18.910 --> 03:06:19.871]  They control arts.
[03:06:19.951 --> 03:06:21.173]  They control entertainment.
[03:06:21.473 --> 03:06:28.560]  They have the complete monopoly on culture, which is why conservatism is the new counterculture.
[03:06:28.620 --> 03:06:31.022]  We are striking back in the culture war.
[03:06:31.503 --> 03:06:35.366]  This triggers snowflakes like nothing you've ever seen in your life.
[03:06:35.426 --> 03:06:37.488]  You've seen how much they absolutely hate
[03:06:38.109 --> 03:06:43.470]  The image of my face and that particular slogan, conservatism, is the new counterculture.
[03:06:43.731 --> 03:06:49.992]  This t-shirt is not only a conversation starter, it will trigger the holy hell out of leftists.
[03:06:50.052 --> 03:06:51.753]  It will make me incredibly happy.
[03:06:51.913 --> 03:06:53.093]  It's available right now.

[03:06:58.098 --> 03:06:59.378]  You can't survive without it.
[03:06:59.578 --> 03:07:00.478]  But where do you get it?
[03:07:00.778 --> 03:07:06.540]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[03:07:06.760 --> 03:07:12.482]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.

[03:07:32.432 --> 03:07:33.613]  Stainless steel construction.

[03:07:34.935 --> 03:07:35.555]  Low maintenance.
[03:07:35.856 --> 03:07:37.677]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[03:07:56.474 --> 03:07:58.555]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:07:59.116 --> 03:08:04.339]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:08:05.199 --> 03:08:10.002]  I wondered so aimless, life filled with sin.
[03:08:10.202 --> 03:08:13.985]  I wouldn't let my dear Savior in.
[03:08:14.725 --> 03:08:19.028]  Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night.
[03:08:19.468 --> 03:08:23.490]  Pray the Lord, I saw the light.
[03:08:23.510 --> 03:08:24.151]  I saw the light!
[03:08:25.455 --> 03:08:27.516]  That's Hank Williams!
[03:08:40.888 --> 03:08:41.469]  Bring us in.
[03:08:41.609 --> 03:08:44.692]  You know, Alex, the Democrats, they said Trump will never win.
[03:08:44.772 --> 03:08:46.874]  The Democrats are now saying Trump's going to get impeached.
[03:08:47.194 --> 03:08:47.794]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:08:48.575 --> 03:08:49.656]  Keep telling yourself that.
[03:08:50.577 --> 03:08:50.897]  Go ahead.
[03:08:51.057 --> 03:08:52.178]  Just keep telling yourself that.
[03:08:52.439 --> 03:08:54.601]  If we get more aggressive and understand how dangerous it is.
[03:08:54.641 --> 03:08:55.441]  Two breaking stories.
[03:08:55.982 --> 03:08:59.365]  AG Sessions ends Obama's DOJ slush fund for far-left groups.
[03:08:59.385 --> 03:08:59.926]  That's big.
[03:09:00.346 --> 03:09:01.327]  Infowars.com.
[03:09:01.367 --> 03:09:04.049]  Finally, he's doing something under Trump pressure to do his job.
[03:09:04.730 --> 03:09:10.213]  Globalists who push EU flags, EU teams, the 2024 Olympics talk about globalism.
[03:09:10.713 --> 03:09:17.577]  Top Dems have rejected a plan so far by a congressman out of Texas, Al Green, to begin the impeachment process.
[03:09:17.617 --> 03:09:18.558]  He's filed the paperwork.
[03:09:19.018 --> 03:09:23.020]  Roger Stone has gotten in the catbird seat here in the fourth hour.
[03:09:23.401 --> 03:09:25.462]  I want to mention a few things that hand the baton to him.
[03:09:26.755 --> 03:09:27.636]  We have a limited crew.
[03:09:27.716 --> 03:09:33.499]  I probably need, like, five or six people just to run promotions and contests.
[03:09:34.059 --> 03:09:39.742]  I need even more editors to fact-check, because we do our own research, but then it's always good to have somebody else double-check it for you.
[03:09:40.162 --> 03:09:41.743]  We need to get more editors, more video crew.
[03:09:42.083 --> 03:09:50.168]  That's why buying the non-GMO, organic, fluoride-free, nano-silver, iodine, super-blue toothpaste is so key.
[03:09:50.728 --> 03:09:51.349]  Been sold out?
[03:09:51.569 --> 03:09:52.289]  Can't keep it in stock?
[03:09:52.309 --> 03:09:53.830]  Still 33% off out of the gates.
[03:09:54.230 --> 03:09:54.991]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:09:56.288 --> 03:10:00.171]  We also have the Biotru Selenium at a price a third of what it is at Whole Foods.
[03:10:00.492 --> 03:10:02.554]  A very similar organic selenium.
[03:10:02.594 --> 03:10:03.895]  Most selenium is synthetic.
[03:10:04.996 --> 03:10:05.716]  This is the real deal.
[03:10:06.137 --> 03:10:07.878]  Totally, absolutely needed in the body.
[03:10:09.119 --> 03:10:13.283]  We've got back in stock Supramel Vitality X2, the lung cleanse.
[03:10:13.303 --> 03:10:14.324]  We've got the liver shield.
[03:10:14.784 --> 03:10:17.407]  All of it is powerful and all of it supports the transmission.
[03:10:17.767 --> 03:10:18.708]  Infowarstore.com.
[03:10:18.728 --> 03:10:19.388]  Why do I raise that?
[03:10:20.790 --> 03:10:22.871]  It's myself and it's Rob Dew.
[03:10:23.874 --> 03:10:34.497]  And then it's the five or six writers we've got in-house that are trying to look at 20 videos or so coming in a day of people in the contests going out and saying CNN's terrorists, CNN's fake news.
[03:10:34.977 --> 03:10:44.120]  The first winner won $2,500 for showing them shooting a fake newscast, a fake event with the, you know, with the staged protesters there in London.
[03:10:45.842 --> 03:10:46.903]  So, I'm not complaining.
[03:10:47.063 --> 03:10:47.763]  I want to do more.
[03:10:48.404 --> 03:10:49.364]  We're going to have articles.
[03:10:49.384 --> 03:10:50.365]  We're going to have videos posted.
[03:10:50.385 --> 03:10:51.206]  We're going to have compilations.
[03:10:51.226 --> 03:10:52.166]  We're going to have you on as guests.
[03:10:52.607 --> 03:10:53.788]  I know there's been some other winners.
[03:10:54.288 --> 03:10:58.591]  Just send in your email and the video you did to contest at InfoWars.com.
[03:10:59.151 --> 03:11:02.413]  And the contest has now been out for about a week or eight days.
[03:11:02.754 --> 03:11:03.294]  It's rolling.
[03:11:03.374 --> 03:11:03.854]  It's working.
[03:11:03.874 --> 03:11:05.435]  It was huge over the weekend.
[03:11:05.556 --> 03:11:06.176]  Live events.
[03:11:06.676 --> 03:11:07.257]  Get it out there.
[03:11:08.186 --> 03:11:18.132]  Now if you just hold up Hillary Clinton's a terrorist, or Bill Clinton's a rapist, or CNN's a terrorist, you can buy the t-shirts by the way of that, or just print the PDFs off the page.
[03:11:19.492 --> 03:11:25.274]  $20,000, $200,000 in cash prizes, M4 launches operation to expose terrorist media, Kathy Griffin.
[03:11:25.614 --> 03:11:31.615]  But it can be whatever I deem, whatever works, whatever is successful, I will deem it.
[03:11:31.655 --> 03:11:33.716]  That's why it's up to me who wins, but I want to pay you.
[03:11:34.396 --> 03:11:37.357]  Even folks that didn't enter it, I said, you did something great exposing CNN, $2,500.
[03:11:38.942 --> 03:11:40.784]  Okay, so, that's how it works.
[03:11:40.844 --> 03:11:46.730]  But then you can have moles come in and try to sue me for no reason, so I've got to have the language, it's all up to me, and, you know, blah blah blah.
[03:11:46.750 --> 03:11:47.931]  But we've had many of these contests.
[03:11:48.311 --> 03:11:50.854]  I've paid out hundreds of thousands before in individual contests.
[03:11:51.234 --> 03:11:52.195]  It's happening, it's going on.
[03:11:52.255 --> 03:12:02.385]  But separately, I had another contest that I'm so sure of, I launched today, but only one person can enter the contest, and that's Chelsea Hubble.
[03:12:03.629 --> 03:12:05.310]  Stories on Infowars.com.
[03:12:05.670 --> 03:12:12.074]  Chelsea Clinton offered $1 million for a DNA test proving Webster Hubble is not her father.
[03:12:12.435 --> 03:12:17.278]  It's got to be with a third party, with video cameras there as they do the DNA test.
[03:12:18.539 --> 03:12:19.299]  We can't have that.
[03:12:20.660 --> 03:12:23.182]  I have the experts, people that knew him, all of it.
[03:12:23.362 --> 03:12:26.904]  Her and Hubble hung out at the law firm, Rose Law Firm.
[03:12:27.184 --> 03:12:28.105]  They were a known item.
[03:12:28.945 --> 03:12:32.768]  And besides, I'm not trying to be mean, Hubble looks like he has a genetic disorder.
[03:12:33.857 --> 03:12:35.719]  The way he talks, you ever saw him testify?
[03:12:35.939 --> 03:12:36.660]  He's like this, look.
[03:12:44.386 --> 03:12:47.789]  And so, you look at it, I mean, let's just say it, I don't mean it mean.
[03:12:48.510 --> 03:12:50.912]  She's an ugly person for helping steal the money from the Haitians.
[03:12:51.192 --> 03:12:53.334]  It's in the WikiLeaks, she knows they stole.
[03:12:53.354 --> 03:12:54.675]  She talks about, we're killing these people.
[03:12:54.855 --> 03:12:55.736]  They're like, that's what we do.
[03:12:56.096 --> 03:12:56.897]  And she went along with it.
[03:12:57.097 --> 03:13:00.320]  She went along with the murder of Haitians, with the UN crapping in their
[03:13:00.820 --> 03:13:11.069]  UN Water Supply giving them cholera and the rape gangs, a huge AP study about the thousands of children, hundreds murdered, and the Clintons overseeing it with giant child kidnapping rings.
[03:13:11.329 --> 03:13:14.492]  Notice they don't want to attack me and say that's fake, because we first broke that.
[03:13:14.512 --> 03:13:15.633]  That was in AP a month ago.
[03:13:16.053 --> 03:13:17.974]  So, this monster, this pig,
[03:13:18.815 --> 03:13:20.615]  Uh, wants to run around with her new foundations.
[03:13:20.635 --> 03:13:22.476]  This, this Webster Hubble's daughter.
[03:13:22.996 --> 03:13:24.816]  This, this vampire of Haitian blood.
[03:13:24.836 --> 03:13:26.417]  Uh, this knight creature.
[03:13:26.437 --> 03:13:29.237]  Uh, I mean, ho, ho, ho, ho, Wilbur!
[03:13:29.837 --> 03:13:36.039]  A horse is a horse, of course, of course, that is, of course, unless the horse is a famous Mr. Ed!
[03:13:36.859 --> 03:13:37.079]  What?
[03:13:37.539 --> 03:13:37.999]  No, nothing.
[03:13:38.019 --> 03:13:41.080]  But Mr. Ed didn't rob starving and dying Haitian children.
[03:13:41.600 --> 03:13:43.360]  So, uh, you know, cover up the U.N.
[03:13:43.420 --> 03:13:43.941]  operations.
[03:13:43.981 --> 03:13:45.601]  So, gloves are off with her.
[03:13:46.834 --> 03:13:48.419]  She's supposed to be the head of the new UN Global...
[03:13:51.380 --> 03:13:55.202]  Tyranny medical system, but that's all blown up in her face.
[03:13:55.563 --> 03:13:58.184]  And so Mr. Ed meets Webster Hubble.
[03:13:58.724 --> 03:14:09.951]  I dare the media to pick up on this because one million smackers, and I'm not made out of money, but I know that if it's done with real third-party live, that's Webster Hubble's daughter.
[03:14:09.991 --> 03:14:12.753]  There's never been genetic features closer.
[03:14:13.313 --> 03:14:14.034]  It's never.
[03:14:14.234 --> 03:14:19.177]  No one on earth has that small upper lip and that gigantic bottom lip.
[03:14:19.497 --> 03:14:21.179]  Nobody's got eyes that look like that.
[03:14:21.239 --> 03:14:22.460]  Nobody's got eyebrows.
[03:14:22.801 --> 03:14:24.803]  I mean, that's Webster Hubble wearing a wig.
[03:14:25.363 --> 03:14:30.429]  So, joining us is one of the main experts exposing all of this, Roger Stone.
[03:14:30.889 --> 03:14:33.312]  Roger, do you think she'll take me up on it?
[03:14:33.332 --> 03:14:35.835]  Do you think Webster Hubble's daughter will take me up on it?
[03:14:36.647 --> 03:14:41.813]  Well, I think a lot of people need to realize, Alex, is those who say, oh, you're picking on a child.
[03:14:42.493 --> 03:14:44.636]  Chelsea Clinton is a 30-year-old adult.
[03:14:44.976 --> 03:14:50.582]  Based on reports published in the New York Post and elsewhere, she's very much like her mother.
[03:14:50.903 --> 03:14:56.649]  Abusive, foul-mouthed, greedy, entitled, and not terribly bright.
[03:14:57.398 --> 03:15:05.362]  Of course, Bill and Hillary have kind of left her holding the bag because she's an officer of the Clinton Foundation.
[03:15:05.462 --> 03:15:16.528]  She's on the documents filed with the IRS and therefore she's legally culpable for the numerous crimes that have been committed there.
[03:15:17.321 --> 03:15:20.022]  The Clinton Foundation, as you know, is not a charity.
[03:15:20.102 --> 03:15:22.182]  It's a slush fund for grifters.
[03:15:23.002 --> 03:15:28.143]  And it's been the vehicle for multi-million dollar bribes and influence peddling.
[03:15:29.183 --> 03:15:42.586]  And Chelsea is actually thinking about running for Congress in a district just north of New York City that is held by Congresswoman Anita Lowey.
[03:15:43.740 --> 03:15:46.918]  I'm told that if she really runs, Danny Williams
[03:15:47.788 --> 03:16:02.160]  The abandoned son of Bill Clinton, who currently lives in Arkansas, but could move into that district, certainly in time to run, with an eye towards the 40% African-American vote in the Democratic primary.
[03:16:02.760 --> 03:16:11.407]  So it could be an epic clash of the offspring of Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton.
[03:16:11.427 --> 03:16:16.712]  They're not brother and sister, Alex, because they do not share a common father.
[03:16:17.412 --> 03:16:17.792]  That's right.
[03:16:17.812 --> 03:16:18.913]  Let's expand on that.
[03:16:18.933 --> 03:16:20.513]  I mean, let's talk seriously.
[03:16:20.533 --> 03:16:23.055]  She's obviously Webster Hubble's daughter.
[03:16:23.115 --> 03:16:26.156]  I've been hearing that for 22 years from the folks locally.
[03:16:26.176 --> 03:16:27.056]  It was well known.
[03:16:27.637 --> 03:16:28.817]  But what's your intel on it?
[03:16:28.837 --> 03:16:41.162]  But I mean, he has striking, probably, I don't mean this as a funny thing, but he looks like he has birth defect type genetics that is very rare and very expressive.
[03:16:41.663 --> 03:16:44.324]  I mean, this looks like he has some type of genetic disorder.
[03:16:44.764 --> 03:16:47.986]  And it appears that that genetic disorder, whatever it is, has been passed on.
[03:16:48.026 --> 03:16:53.750]  These are strikingly, strikingly, you know, nuclear fallout victim features.
[03:16:54.391 --> 03:16:59.114]  Well, I think it goes beyond just the physical resemblance between Webster Hubble and his daughter.
[03:16:59.813 --> 03:17:01.934]  First of all, there is the fact that L.D.
[03:17:01.994 --> 03:17:09.957]  Brown, who was a personal bodyguard and driver for Bill Clinton, says that Clinton told him that he read about Hillary's pregnancy in the newspaper.
[03:17:10.678 --> 03:17:22.563]  Secondarily, there is the fact that the World Net Daily contacted Mr. Hubble, asked him point blank if he was Chelsea's father, whereupon he said no comment, and he hung up.
[03:17:23.388 --> 03:17:24.008]  No denial.
[03:17:25.029 --> 03:17:37.434]  It is also true that Larry Nichols said that Hillary Clinton was overheard saying, if I have to do Webb Hubble to get into the Rose Law Firm, I will do so.
[03:17:38.155 --> 03:17:46.819]  Also in Hillary Clinton's own book, she says that a large football player-sized man taught her the proper way to hold a baby.
[03:17:46.839 --> 03:17:49.560]  That doesn't sound like Bill Clinton to me.
[03:17:50.782 --> 03:17:52.384]  Well, but they're striking!
[03:17:52.764 --> 03:17:58.970]  I mean, it's like if somebody had a genetic disorder where they're like, you know, are missing their teeth or don't have a nose.
[03:17:59.671 --> 03:18:03.955]  I mean, I don't mean to make fun of her, but she is such a monster, such a pig.
[03:18:03.975 --> 03:18:05.796]  I mean, she's in the emails.
[03:18:06.892 --> 03:18:10.413]  You know, talking about dying people and now they're killing people and she didn't do anything about it.
[03:18:10.933 --> 03:18:20.776]  And as you know Alex, she's had multiple plastic surgeries in an attempt to minimize her resemblance to her father.
[03:18:21.337 --> 03:18:25.698]  So look, she is clearly, the Clinton Foundation is still in existence.
[03:18:26.318 --> 03:18:38.504]  The Clinton political machine is still in existence, and just as Hillary's having a hard time getting off the stage with her selective memory in that performance at Wellesley.
[03:18:39.004 --> 03:18:49.690]  In all honesty, in a perfect world, when Hillary Clinton came down off the platform at Wellesley from giving the commencement address, she should have been handcuffed by federal marshals.
[03:18:50.430 --> 03:18:58.202]  Because it's time for Jeff Sessions to convene a grand jury and examine the criminal activity of the Clinton Foundation.
[03:18:58.723 --> 03:19:06.234]  John Podesta, Tony Podesta, what they were doing with the Russians, what they were doing with the oligarchs around Russia.
[03:19:06.514 --> 03:19:09.396]  Hold on, let's talk about Comey coming up and take a few calls.
[03:19:09.456 --> 03:19:14.238]  I promise I'll let you take over, Roger Stone, so you'll have your own show five days a week, so it won't matter when I'm cutting in.
[03:19:14.599 --> 03:19:16.520]  There'll be too much time for me to even be able to do that.
[03:19:16.860 --> 03:19:28.827]  But since we're talking about Chelsea Hubble, Clinton, and the new contest of a million dollars for her if she'll get a paternity test, I thought we should actually hear from her under the Fairness Doctrine and actually hear a statement from her.
[03:19:28.887 --> 03:19:29.267]  Here it is.
[03:19:31.308 --> 03:19:31.888]  Hello.
[03:19:33.309 --> 03:19:34.190]  I'm Mr. Red.
[03:19:38.871 --> 03:19:40.853]  A horse is a horse, of course, of course.
[03:19:41.033 --> 03:19:43.015]  And no one can talk to a horse, of course.
[03:19:43.135 --> 03:19:46.920]  That is, of course, unless the horse is the famous Mr. Ed.
[03:19:47.380 --> 03:19:49.422]  Go right to the source and ask the horse.
[03:19:49.502 --> 03:19:51.565]  He'll give you the answer that you endorse.
[03:19:51.625 --> 03:19:53.687]  He's always on a steady course.
[03:19:53.907 --> 03:19:54.788]  Talk to Mr. Ed.
[03:19:59.500 --> 03:20:00.982]  That horse could be a million dollars richer.
[03:20:01.102 --> 03:20:07.328]  I was about to say, the horses are beautiful, but it's actually on the show, and they give it peanut butter or whatever, and it's lips goes, oh, Wilbur!
[03:20:07.469 --> 03:20:15.357]  Because he's, I used to, I was fascinated by Wester Hubbell in the 90s, because he was always testifying in Congress about some scandal, and it was like, the only thing that moved was his bottom lip.
[03:20:15.377 --> 03:20:15.597]  He'd go...
[03:20:16.573 --> 03:20:21.734]  In fact, guys, YouTube or go to C-SPAN's own archive and just type in, Webster Hubble testifies.
[03:20:22.355 --> 03:20:26.056]  And it's the craziest thing that you've ever seen.
[03:20:26.096 --> 03:20:27.096]  It made me believe David Icke.
[03:20:27.116 --> 03:20:28.336]  There's like reptoids running things.
[03:20:28.356 --> 03:20:29.076]  I don't really believe that.
[03:20:29.096 --> 03:20:31.957]  But what is, seriously, I don't mean to make fun of people the way they look usually.
[03:20:32.317 --> 03:20:35.518]  Then we're going to go to Jason and Jeremy and John, I don't know, and I'm going to get out of here and let you take over.
[03:20:35.538 --> 03:20:37.039]  But what is going on with Webster Hubble?
[03:20:37.079 --> 03:20:38.179]  I mean, what is this guy's deal?
[03:20:39.298 --> 03:20:40.879]  Well, I think it's very important.
[03:20:40.899 --> 03:20:43.481]  He's the guy who does the dirty work for the Clintons.
[03:20:43.521 --> 03:20:47.643]  He's the Deputy Attorney General of the United States under Janet Reno.
[03:20:47.703 --> 03:20:50.005]  He's supposed to be Reno's manager.
[03:20:50.672 --> 03:20:52.994]  Hillary Clinton selected Janet Reno.
[03:20:53.394 --> 03:20:55.856]  Janet Reno acted on Hillary Clinton's orders.
[03:20:56.276 --> 03:21:00.739]  Hillary Clinton is the one who orders Janet Reno to launch the assault at Waco.
[03:21:01.400 --> 03:21:04.742]  And it is Webster Hubble who transmits that order.
[03:21:05.182 --> 03:21:11.206]  Hillary, to her lover, Hubble, the father of her child, to Janet Reno.
[03:21:11.627 --> 03:21:15.930]  And as you know, as many as 18 children under the age of 8
[03:21:16.950 --> 03:21:21.433]  I die in that conflagration, that unnecessary confrontation.
[03:21:21.473 --> 03:21:23.194]  But it was liberals, so it's okay.
[03:21:24.215 --> 03:21:32.420]  Well, it is horrific, the brute force that the federal government uses on these outcasts.
[03:21:33.160 --> 03:21:36.362]  And the disinformation about them abusing children and so on.
[03:21:36.742 --> 03:21:39.604]  They killed 18 children in a firefight.
[03:21:40.045 --> 03:21:41.145]  Who stands up for children?
[03:21:41.425 --> 03:21:42.686]  Who's an advocate for children?
[03:21:42.726 --> 03:21:44.507]  Hillary Clinton murders children.
[03:21:44.787 --> 03:21:45.428]  There you have it.
[03:21:46.889 --> 03:21:48.351]  Man, Webster Hubble is so weird.
[03:21:48.732 --> 03:21:51.316]  That's a side shot they got straight on in Congress.
[03:21:51.336 --> 03:21:51.797]  That's funny.
[03:21:52.198 --> 03:21:53.500]  It is unbelievable.
[03:21:53.540 --> 03:21:55.463]  That's what Chelsea looks like when she talks, too.
[03:21:55.663 --> 03:21:57.186]  And she has the same forehead and everything.
[03:21:58.308 --> 03:22:00.810]  Yeah, it's that whole rubber lip thing.
[03:22:00.850 --> 03:22:01.910]  Rubber face, even.
[03:22:02.010 --> 03:22:02.531]  Yeah, that's it.
[03:22:02.551 --> 03:22:03.511]  They look, that's it.
[03:22:03.591 --> 03:22:05.052]  It looks like a rubber mask.
[03:22:05.272 --> 03:22:05.452]  Yeah.
[03:22:05.552 --> 03:22:09.515]  How about making fun of the fact that they look like cavemen or something?
[03:22:09.555 --> 03:22:10.535]  I don't know what's going on.
[03:22:10.756 --> 03:22:18.660]  Well, and just look at the, if you just look at the two families just on the table right here, say here's the Clinton family versus the Trump family.
[03:22:18.680 --> 03:22:19.401]  Here's the Trump family.
[03:22:20.001 --> 03:22:26.548]  Uh, good people, hardworking, building things, prosperous, tight family together, have each other's back.
[03:22:26.869 --> 03:22:27.910]  Then you have the Clinton family.
[03:22:28.010 --> 03:22:32.094]  You have a son who's besmirched from the family.
[03:22:32.154 --> 03:22:33.395]  He's not even allowed to exist.
[03:22:33.415 --> 03:22:35.357]  They completely deny Danny Williams' existence.
[03:22:35.718 --> 03:22:40.463]  Then you have Chelsea Clinton-Hubbell, who's actually not even the son of Bill Clinton.
[03:22:40.723 --> 03:22:50.671]  So there's the Clinton family, a complete nightmare, a complete disaster, not what you want your family to be like, versus the Trump family, which is more like what you would want your family to be like.
[03:22:50.711 --> 03:22:53.073]  And the bigger thing is they're constantly robbing everything.
[03:22:53.194 --> 03:22:57.978]  Old folks, pension funds, land, Haitians, they're just a group of disgusting filth.
[03:22:59.239 --> 03:23:02.623]  Roger Stone is hosting right now, but he was a little bit late so we took over.
[03:23:02.723 --> 03:23:03.143]  He's with us.
[03:23:03.163 --> 03:23:05.125]  He's going to break down Comey here in just a couple minutes.
[03:23:05.165 --> 03:23:08.009]  Right now, John Illinois, then Jason in Germany, and we'll be out of here.
[03:23:08.769 --> 03:23:10.691]  John in Illinois, go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:23:12.614 --> 03:23:14.095]  Hey Alex, hey Roger.
[03:23:14.676 --> 03:23:18.680]  I was actually calling about something that's been bothering me these past few months.
[03:23:19.040 --> 03:23:26.167]  We've been watching the Muslim extremists running over the West and its values.
[03:23:26.667 --> 03:23:30.571]  So if you're like me and you've been getting mad at this,
[03:23:31.164 --> 03:23:33.027]  This is your chance to do something about it.
[03:23:33.347 --> 03:23:38.534]  This Saturday, June 10th, Act for America is having a march against Sharia.
[03:23:38.934 --> 03:23:40.256]  And we need everybody there.
[03:23:40.276 --> 03:23:42.639]  The lefties are going to be counter-protesting.
[03:23:42.659 --> 03:23:47.866]  You know, they're probably going to bring the black bloc and start getting violent or whatever, which is why we need
[03:23:48.446 --> 03:23:56.228]  People there with cameras, documenting, observing, and just, you know, acting for America, for American values.
[03:23:56.248 --> 03:24:03.131]  Wow, that's something we need to cover, just to show how these scumbag communists are on the side of people, you know, who like literally cut women's genitals off.
[03:24:03.151 --> 03:24:04.591]  Looks like there's one in Austin.
[03:24:04.611 --> 03:24:08.432]  If you guys could zoom in on that map, it looks like they had one in Austin.
[03:24:09.353 --> 03:24:10.533]  Oh really, the march against Sharia?
[03:24:12.560 --> 03:24:15.822]  Yeah, March Against Sharia, it's by Act for America.
[03:24:16.222 --> 03:24:24.025]  It's an organization started by Bridget Gabriel, who was born in Lebanese, and she's Middle Eastern.
[03:24:24.065 --> 03:24:31.209]  Her family were Christians, and they were driven away from their own country because of Muslim extremists in the 80s.
[03:24:31.749 --> 03:24:37.632]  So she came over here, and she's just a great patriot now, standing up for American values.
[03:24:38.352 --> 03:24:41.474]  And, you know, these are the types of people we need to support.
[03:24:41.574 --> 03:24:42.835]  And it's not even about race.
[03:24:42.895 --> 03:24:44.435]  It's not even about anything like that.
[03:24:44.455 --> 03:24:46.236]  Sure, it's about a cult-like ideology.
[03:24:46.256 --> 03:24:47.517]  It's about a cult-like ideology.
[03:24:47.597 --> 03:24:49.018]  Alright, we'll look into it.
[03:24:49.538 --> 03:24:50.318]  I've heard of the group.
[03:24:50.398 --> 03:24:51.139]  Very interesting.
[03:24:51.179 --> 03:24:51.699]  Great point.
[03:24:52.439 --> 03:24:53.200]  Anything else, Sean?
[03:24:55.161 --> 03:24:56.363]  Oh, just one more thing.
[03:24:56.984 --> 03:25:08.760]  You know, I like Trump, I like what he's doing, but I just want to say that I don't like the arms deal with Saudi Arabia and we need to support Rand Paul blocking of that deal because
[03:25:10.013 --> 03:25:16.375]  Mark my words, those weapons are going to land in the hands of ISIS and are going to end up killing American citizens.
[03:25:16.515 --> 03:25:20.237]  And Trump will be, his legacy will be destroyed because of that.
[03:25:20.377 --> 03:25:21.477]  I hear you, it's a good point.
[03:25:21.497 --> 03:25:24.538]  Let me get Roger Stone's take on that because I see what Trump is doing.
[03:25:24.558 --> 03:25:26.799]  He just wants gross numbers to get the economy going.
[03:25:27.519 --> 03:25:30.581]  Saudi Arabia got fighter bombers and high-tech missiles.
[03:25:31.021 --> 03:25:34.182]  I don't disagree with the caller totally, but that's not going to get in the hands of ISIS.
[03:25:34.802 --> 03:25:36.963]  And it's seen as a deal to get them to stop
[03:25:37.543 --> 03:25:43.310]  You know, trying to use civil war to take down Iran, but to give them weapons to stand up against Iran in case Iran attacks.
[03:25:43.631 --> 03:25:46.614]  But Roger Stone at the time said it made him sick to watch that.
[03:25:46.654 --> 03:25:48.256]  He still likes Trump, but that did make him sick.
[03:25:48.577 --> 03:25:49.478]  Roger, your take on that?
[03:25:50.353 --> 03:25:51.394]  Yeah, I want to be very clear.
[03:25:51.434 --> 03:25:56.997]  What made me sick, Alex, was the photograph of the President bowing to the Saudi King.
[03:25:57.917 --> 03:26:01.859]  If the Saudi King wants to give our President a medal, he can stand on a soapbox.
[03:26:03.280 --> 03:26:07.623]  In other words, the President's handlers should never have allowed him to be seen that way.
[03:26:08.163 --> 03:26:12.546]  He did not bow to the Saudi leaders when he first met them, as Obama did.
[03:26:13.166 --> 03:26:16.108]  His genuflection was polite, but nothing outrageous.
[03:26:16.408 --> 03:26:18.109]  Well, he curtsied so he could get it over his head.
[03:26:18.809 --> 03:26:26.391]  This was a bow, and it shows obsequience, and that photograph is now used in the Islamic world as propaganda.
[03:26:27.712 --> 03:26:34.514]  I understand why the President feels that he must play off the Saudis against Iran.
[03:26:34.574 --> 03:26:37.935]  Right now, a nuclear Iran is a greater problem.
[03:26:38.475 --> 03:26:42.656]  Not to say that he trusts the Saudis, not that he doesn't understand their transgressions.
[03:26:43.096 --> 03:26:44.397]  So this is high stakes.
[03:26:45.057 --> 03:26:46.398]  You know, breakmanship.
[03:26:46.518 --> 03:26:51.281]  This is Nixon-style foreign policy maneuver.
[03:26:52.342 --> 03:27:02.909]  But I tend to agree that the Saudis, who clearly have a role in the attack on 9-11, ultimately have to be held accountable by this president.
[03:27:03.109 --> 03:27:13.156]  Both houses of Congress have passed legislation that, as you know, Alex, would require them to pay the families in New York who were successful in bringing a lawsuit.
[03:27:13.716 --> 03:27:14.677]  They resist that.
[03:27:15.597 --> 03:27:17.398]  So, it's a delicate balance.
[03:27:18.319 --> 03:27:24.341]  Overall, I approve what the President did in terms of utilizing the Saudis in this chess game with Iran.
[03:27:25.162 --> 03:27:29.464]  On the other hand, they have to pay up, ultimately, and I think the President knows that.
[03:27:29.784 --> 03:27:32.485]  Absolutely, but pulling us out of the climate deal, all of it's amazing.
[03:27:32.785 --> 03:27:33.946]  Last call, I've got time for this.
[03:27:34.066 --> 03:27:36.107]  Stone's got big news on coming, the inside scoop.
[03:27:36.407 --> 03:27:37.408]  I shouldn't even be cutting in here.
[03:27:37.768 --> 03:27:39.429]  Jason in Germany, but I promise clear your calls.
[03:27:39.469 --> 03:27:40.069]  Jason, you're on the air.
[03:27:41.710 --> 03:27:42.370]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:27:42.890 --> 03:27:47.691]  I have one minute, probably, or two, and I probably need more like ten, but I'll try to go real fast.
[03:27:48.071 --> 03:27:49.451]  First, a little bone to pick with you.
[03:27:49.611 --> 03:27:55.592]  I know you guys are super busy, but it's been two weeks since I submitted my article to you and I haven't heard back from anybody.
[03:27:56.473 --> 03:28:00.933]  I really need you, I need somebody to look at that article because it's 100% Veritas.
[03:28:00.973 --> 03:28:02.214]  I know that's what you're into.
[03:28:02.374 --> 03:28:05.974]  I know, we're trying to get a bigger crew to get more articles from you guys, and we're trying hard.
[03:28:06.214 --> 03:28:09.355]  What was the title of the article so we can search it in our email?
[03:28:10.569 --> 03:28:13.650]  Okay, it's called Can Trump Save Himself and Us Too.
[03:28:13.871 --> 03:28:17.252]  It's got my name in the subject line as well.
[03:28:18.133 --> 03:28:19.153]  You can tweet that at me.
[03:28:19.213 --> 03:28:20.854]  If you tweet it at me, I can try to find you.
[03:28:20.874 --> 03:28:22.935]  Yeah, one thing to do is find your own place and post stuff.
[03:28:22.955 --> 03:28:24.235]  That's the better way to get it to us too.
[03:28:24.876 --> 03:28:25.096]  Go ahead.
[03:28:26.432 --> 03:28:30.516]  Actually, I posted it on an anonymous site and they classified it as hate speech and took it down.
[03:28:30.536 --> 03:28:31.637]  I couldn't believe it.
[03:28:32.558 --> 03:28:33.579]  There's nothing hateful about it.
[03:28:34.640 --> 03:28:47.612]  Real quick, to my second point, and I'm speaking totally from my heart here, Alex, I know this is something you can totally relate to when you have the understanding of complex issues that nobody else seems to have and you can actually articulate it in a way that other people can understand.
[03:28:48.352 --> 03:28:54.698]  I believe that I have the type of what Americans want and need, and I believe that if Trump will give it to them, he will win.
[03:28:55.018 --> 03:28:57.961]  And I can prove this, going back through all my tweet history.
[03:28:58.301 --> 03:29:06.909]  In fact, it's so weird that just recently the follow-up with Trump and Sessions is hitting, and literally a couple weeks after Sessions came on... Sure, you've called.
[03:29:07.009 --> 03:29:08.070]  Stone agrees with this.
[03:29:08.090 --> 03:29:08.971]  He really shouldn't be...
[03:29:09.977 --> 03:29:12.979]  You know, put marijuana smokers in prison for a thousand years.
[03:29:13.280 --> 03:29:14.340]  He really should decriminalize.
[03:29:14.360 --> 03:29:15.862]  It doesn't mean we agree with the whole marijuana culture.
[03:29:16.202 --> 03:29:16.882]  I appreciate your call.
[03:29:16.922 --> 03:29:19.985]  Real quick, Roger, take over your take on Trump and the marijuana.
[03:29:21.041 --> 03:29:31.567]  Well, I just wish Jeff Sessions would focus more on Susan Rice and the illegal monitoring of Americans by the NSA, and less on a victimless crime, marijuana.
[03:29:32.007 --> 03:29:37.651]  That's what I thought we appointed Jeff Sessions for, and he's been less than aggressive on the President's behalf.
[03:29:37.891 --> 03:29:43.254]  Straight ahead, Roger Stone is in the catbird seat, breaking down the Comey hearing tomorrow.
[03:29:43.514 --> 03:29:46.496]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:47.416 --> 03:29:50.098]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:55.309 --> 03:30:03.051]  Infowars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of advanced, highly tested body armor from InfowarsStore.com.
[03:30:03.291 --> 03:30:09.713]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[03:30:09.933 --> 03:30:18.236]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor.
[03:30:18.516 --> 03:30:24.138]  Using one of the strongest synthetic materials ever created, called ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene.
[03:30:24.378 --> 03:30:27.280]  Defender armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[03:30:27.520 --> 03:30:33.282]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line of advanced lightweight armor.
[03:30:33.622 --> 03:30:34.102]  It works.
[03:30:34.383 --> 03:30:42.729]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest level ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ ballistic laboratory.
[03:30:42.849 --> 03:30:52.276]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarsTore.com so you can defend yourself, your family, and finance the Info War against the globalists all at the same time.
[03:30:52.596 --> 03:30:53.817]  A total 360 win.
[03:30:57.199 --> 03:31:02.003]  Chelsea Clinton has just released a new children's book!
[03:31:04.659 --> 03:31:11.744]  And it's about 13 historical women who pursued their goals in the face of opposition.
[03:31:12.124 --> 03:31:30.917]  The rebel media caught up with Chelsea at a book signing event and had the brilliant idea of asking her to sign the book titled, She Persisted, for Juanita Broderick, who as we all know, was sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and silenced by Hillary.
[03:31:31.257 --> 03:31:33.098]  Can you sign it for my friend Juanita Broderick?
[03:31:33.138 --> 03:31:36.920]  Because she's been silenced by your parents, especially Bill Clinton, who's a rapist.
[03:31:36.940 --> 03:31:38.901]  Can you sign it for her?
[03:31:38.941 --> 03:31:45.184]  Naturally, Chelsea refused to sign the book, but her reaction was priceless.
[03:31:45.904 --> 03:31:50.627]  And you can watch the video in its entirety right now at InfoWars.com.
[03:31:55.812 --> 03:32:02.896]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.

[03:33:01.381 --> 03:33:02.001]  I follow Mark.
[03:33:03.132 --> 03:33:05.474]  Let me make this perfectly clear.
[03:33:05.494 --> 03:33:07.415]  You're listening to Roger Stone.
[03:33:08.215 --> 03:33:14.440]  On and forth.
[03:33:15.600 --> 03:33:16.221]  Welcome back.
[03:33:18.082 --> 03:33:25.807]  I'm your host, Roger Stone, sitting in for Alex Jones and Owen Schroyer, who's obviously trying to do the young Abraham Lincoln thing.
[03:33:27.711 --> 03:33:43.256]  All Washington is, of course, focused on the coming shootout at the OK Corral, the classic clash between James Comey testifying before Congress and Donald Trump sitting at his Twitter feed.
[03:33:44.336 --> 03:33:50.298]  This has the potential to be mesmerizing as both sides gear up for battle.
[03:33:51.479 --> 03:33:55.140]  Mr. Comey is widely expected to accuse the president
[03:33:56.003 --> 03:34:01.538]  ...of impeding the investigation into General Flynn and asking him to end it.
[03:34:02.960 --> 03:34:31.235]  If Mr. Comey wants to talk about obstruction, and he wants to talk about memos, because it is alleged that he wrote a memo, according to the New York Times, that he, pardon me, he received a memo, according to the Times, he believed the memo to be real, and that memo alleges obstruction at the highest level,
[03:34:32.128 --> 03:34:34.050]  of the Obama administration.
[03:34:34.830 --> 03:34:41.135]  Now, the memo has been since proved to be a forgery, but Mr. Comey believed it.
[03:34:41.195 --> 03:34:44.398]  Therefore, he thought there was an obstruction of justice.
[03:34:45.078 --> 03:34:48.001]  He did not report this as an officer of the court.
[03:34:48.581 --> 03:34:51.544]  Instead, he furthered that obstruction.
[03:34:52.464 --> 03:35:00.571]  This would, of course, explain why his comments about Hillary Clinton were so caustic, yet he reached a conclusion
[03:35:01.601 --> 03:35:04.944]  That was the result of a political fix above him.
[03:35:06.245 --> 03:35:10.448]  To me, this shreds any credibility regarding Mr. Comey.
[03:35:11.149 --> 03:35:21.438]  Mr. Comey alleges to the media that he has contemporaneous memos written to himself saying that the president was impeding justice.
[03:35:22.178 --> 03:35:26.222]  Why then did he not report these as an officer of the court?
[03:35:26.702 --> 03:35:28.784]  Why are we only learning this now?
[03:35:29.932 --> 03:35:40.660]  The acting Attorney General, Mr. Rosenstiel, in this matter, says that there is no evidence of collusion by Donald Trump and his associates.
[03:35:41.400 --> 03:35:54.930]  Perhaps the President asked him to wrap up the investigation of General Flynn, because based on what we have seen so far, while General Flynn may have done some things that were inadvisable, perhaps even stupid,
[03:35:55.973 --> 03:36:01.736]  They didn't constitute crimes, nor did they constitute collusion with the Russian state.
[03:36:02.997 --> 03:36:08.079]  Trump can only win the shootout tomorrow with an offensive strategy.
[03:36:08.960 --> 03:36:10.521]  I remind you of Stone's rules.
[03:36:11.161 --> 03:36:13.082]  Attack, attack, attack.
[03:36:14.102 --> 03:36:17.284]  Mr. Comey has plenty in his record to attack.
[03:36:18.645 --> 03:36:24.908]  HSBC, the international bank, has caught money laundering hundreds of thousands of dollars for the drug industry.
[03:36:26.064 --> 03:36:30.906]  Mr. Comey ensures that they pay a hefty fine, but no one goes to jail.
[03:36:31.787 --> 03:36:37.209]  Thereupon, Mr. Comey goes on the board of directors at HSBC.
[03:36:38.029 --> 03:36:39.730]  How much was he paid?
[03:36:41.031 --> 03:36:52.476]  He also is associated with the various interests, including Lockheed, which is, without any question, the most corrupt
[03:36:54.657 --> 03:36:59.461]  a company and defense contractor in the country.
[03:37:00.182 --> 03:37:04.986]  They have enormous, egregious violations of law and cost overruns.
[03:37:05.647 --> 03:37:13.995]  Again, no one goes to jail, their problems are all worked out, and they pay fines which they can well afford.
[03:37:14.715 --> 03:37:17.718]  And then they pay Mr. Comey $6 million.
[03:37:20.069 --> 03:37:27.756]  The fact that James Comey was the prosecutor in the Sandy Rich, pardon me, the Sandy Berger affair.
[03:37:28.396 --> 03:37:29.677]  You remember Sandy Berger.
[03:37:30.298 --> 03:37:34.021]  He was Bill Clinton's national security advisor.
[03:37:34.887 --> 03:37:37.328]  He slipped into the National Archives.
[03:37:38.168 --> 03:37:46.912]  He talked a docent into leaving the room because he said he had to take a classified super-secret cell phone call.
[03:37:47.653 --> 03:37:57.817]  He then stuffed documents down the front of his pants that proved that Bill Clinton could have taken out Osama bin Laden, but didn't.
[03:37:59.321 --> 03:38:01.482]  The prosecutor in this case, James Comey.
[03:38:01.982 --> 03:38:02.943]  The charges brought?
[03:38:03.583 --> 03:38:03.883]  None.
[03:38:04.484 --> 03:38:06.865]  Covering for the Clinton crime family.
[03:38:07.905 --> 03:38:10.086]  Then there's the Mark Rich matter.
[03:38:10.146 --> 03:38:11.387]  You remember Mark Rich.
[03:38:12.287 --> 03:38:14.529]  He was an international fugitive from justice.
[03:38:14.949 --> 03:38:17.410]  A man who'd stole hundreds of millions of dollars.
[03:38:18.230 --> 03:38:23.113]  He funneled huge million dollar contributions to the Clinton Foundation through his wife.
[03:38:23.991 --> 03:38:33.595]  He skipped the entire pardon process only to receive a pardon at the last minute from President Clinton.
[03:38:34.355 --> 03:38:44.540]  Now James Comey had actually been the prosecutor in the Mark Rich case and then he was appointed to oversee whether there had been any impropriety of Mr.
[03:38:45.552 --> 03:38:50.614]  Comey's purchase, pardon me, Mr. Rich's purchase of a pardon.
[03:38:51.315 --> 03:38:54.696]  And again, no charges were brought.
[03:38:56.237 --> 03:39:02.859]  Who can forget that Mr. Comey emerged in the beginning as an assistant director of the Whitewater Inquiry.
[03:39:04.000 --> 03:39:11.023]  Whitewater is a complicated real estate transaction in which no one really makes money.
[03:39:12.020 --> 03:39:23.790]  But Bill Clinton is able to extract $850,000 to finance the media blitz that returned him to the governor's mansion after losing in the previous election.
[03:39:24.651 --> 03:39:28.735]  That sets the stage for his election as President of the United States.
[03:39:29.655 --> 03:39:34.319]  Jim and Susan McDougal, friends of the Clintons, take the fall.
[03:39:35.100 --> 03:39:41.762]  McDougal goes to prison and dies there when denied the medication he needed for survival.
[03:39:42.543 --> 03:39:48.785]  And Susan McDougal refuses to testify against the president and is temporarily jailed.
[03:39:49.699 --> 03:39:54.841]  Mr. Comey assures that no charges are brought against the Clintons.
[03:39:55.661 --> 03:40:06.186]  So this FBI director, call him J. Edgar Comey, if you will, had become a law unto himself.
[03:40:07.446 --> 03:40:12.848]  He would decide what crimes he would investigate and what crimes he would not.
[03:40:14.329 --> 03:40:18.871]  It's important to note when Senator Chuck Grassley, who's the ranking member of the Senate
[03:40:19.665 --> 03:40:30.271]  Judiciary Committee asked Mr. Comey about the fraudulent memo which claimed obstruction of justice by Loretta Lynch and the Clinton campaign.
[03:40:31.131 --> 03:40:33.492]  Mr. Comey declined to discuss it.
[03:40:34.673 --> 03:40:41.757]  The New York Times tells us that there was widespread belief within the FBI that the document in question was a forgery.
[03:40:42.478 --> 03:40:52.186]  Yet Mr. Comey chose to embrace it and based his decision not to prosecute Hillary Clinton on the basis of this memo.
[03:40:53.247 --> 03:40:57.910]  This, to me, should be a crux of the attack on his credibility.
[03:40:58.511 --> 03:41:00.092]  He has no credibility.
[03:41:00.292 --> 03:41:05.817]  He is a political animal who has, without any question, politicized the FBI.
[03:41:07.446 --> 03:41:17.753]  Speaking of the FBI, we have a new director, Christopher Wray, a close associate of former or current New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.
[03:41:18.834 --> 03:41:26.099]  I had hoped the president would pick somebody who is outside the political system, someone who is not inherently political.
[03:41:26.639 --> 03:41:28.741]  Frankly, his ties to Christie are troubling.
[03:41:29.281 --> 03:41:51.449]  Christie is among those drug warriors who want Jeff Sessions to step up his attack on marijuana instead of attacking the Democratic Party for the surveillance and violation of the Constitution when it comes to spying on Americans or those who have leaked in the furtherance of the phony Russian collusion claim.
[03:41:52.748 --> 03:42:00.611]  Meanwhile, the NSA announces that they've doubled down in their efforts to find some link between Donald Trump and the Russians.
[03:42:01.611 --> 03:42:02.591]  What does that tell me?
[03:42:02.611 --> 03:42:05.252]  It tells me that they have nothing.
[03:42:06.052 --> 03:42:22.158]  You notice that the conversation shifted between Russian assistance for Donald Trump before the election and whether Jared Kushner, the President's son-in-law, had a back channel to the Russians after the election.
[03:42:23.385 --> 03:42:26.167]  Such a backchannel would of course be perfectly legal.
[03:42:26.827 --> 03:42:29.209]  Barack Obama had a backchannel to Iran.
[03:42:29.949 --> 03:42:32.651]  Richard Nixon had a backchannel to China.
[03:42:32.711 --> 03:42:38.655]  By that we mean not going through the Central Intelligence Agency, not going through the State Department.
[03:42:39.555 --> 03:42:50.722]  It's completely reasonable that the President would have a concern that any dialogue with the Russians through the bureaucrats and neocons inside his government would result in leaks.
[03:42:51.923 --> 03:42:55.767]  The president has the right to conduct foreign policy as he sees fit.
[03:42:56.948 --> 03:43:09.179]  I've been a critic of Jared Kushner, but to hang him, to declare him guilty on the basis of conversations after the election with the Russian government, well that would just be wrong.
[03:43:09.960 --> 03:43:13.423]  Mr. Kushner should have his day in court, as should
[03:43:14.389 --> 03:43:42.103]  General Flynn, but so far, even Dianne Feinstein and that ubiquitous Tower of Mush, the ambitious, whining Adam Schiff of California, who is, I think at this post, most people realize that in Washington, D.C., the most dangerous place to be is between Congressman Adam Schiff and a television camera.
[03:43:43.208 --> 03:43:52.112]  He has consistently claimed evidence of Russian collusion only to admit on April 2nd that he's seen no such proof.
[03:43:52.672 --> 03:44:11.200]  He has lied repeatedly about my relationship with Guccifer 2.0, not a Russian asset, and an exchange that's now entirely public and meaningless, and my contacts indirectly to WikiLeaks and Julian Assange.
[03:44:12.119 --> 03:44:13.540]  Assange is a journalist.
[03:44:14.681 --> 03:44:18.843]  He gets information from sources and he publishes it.
[03:44:19.844 --> 03:44:28.009]  Some argue that he's committed a crime because he, in some cases, has published information which has been purloined and sent to him.
[03:44:29.290 --> 03:44:32.713]  Perhaps these people should study the Pentagon Papers case.
[03:44:34.514 --> 03:44:38.977]  Documents were stolen from the Nixon administration that documented the origins
[03:44:40.166 --> 03:44:41.868]  of the Vietnam War.
[03:44:42.808 --> 03:44:45.090]  They were published by the New York Times.
[03:44:46.051 --> 03:44:54.878]  Thus, the New York Times published stolen material for the benefit of the people and in the interest of a free press.
[03:44:55.779 --> 03:45:01.564]  The courts held that the publication of the New York Times of this information could not be blocked.
[03:45:02.864 --> 03:45:05.827]  What's the difference between WikiLeaks and the New York Times?
[03:45:06.348 --> 03:45:07.369]  Or the Washington Post?
[03:45:07.489 --> 03:45:08.930]  Or the record of Bergen?
[03:45:09.331 --> 03:45:11.253]  Or any other newspaper in the country?
[03:45:11.993 --> 03:45:22.764]  It is a slippery slope when we begin to prosecute or threaten journalists and demand that they reveal their sources.
[03:45:23.925 --> 03:45:34.975]  This entire attack has been a fabrication of Mr. Schiff and Senator Warner and John McCain.
[03:45:35.676 --> 03:45:38.918]  Meanwhile, John McCain may have some answering of his own to do.
[03:45:39.779 --> 03:45:48.307]  He met with Derek, he met with Oleg Deripaska, an oligarch close to Putin.
[03:45:49.147 --> 03:46:03.517]  He was specifically warned, contacted and warned by the intelligence agencies that Deripaska was an associate of Putin and was working for the furtherment of the Russian state.
[03:46:04.378 --> 03:46:08.841]  Senator McCain chose to meet anyway with Mr. Deripaska.
[03:46:09.602 --> 03:46:11.983]  I would like to know what the Senator discussed.
[03:46:12.664 --> 03:46:14.725]  I would like to know if Senator
[03:46:15.649 --> 03:46:29.957]  McCain solicited Mr. Deripaska for multi-million dollar contributions for the International Republican Institute, a front group controlled by Senator John McCain.
[03:46:31.247 --> 03:46:47.793]  I'd also like to know why key staffers at the Institute would later be identified as Soviet moles and would ultimately be discharged, despite the fact that they were hired by John McCain.
[03:46:48.573 --> 03:46:54.055]  So, I'd say that Senator McCain has some answering to do on his own.
[03:46:55.151 --> 03:47:07.805]  He famously said on television, Roger Stone should come before the Congress and explain his ties to the Kremlin and to Mr. Yanukovych, referring to the former Ukrainian president.
[03:47:08.626 --> 03:47:10.448]  Let me break this down for you, Senator.
[03:47:11.696 --> 03:47:18.965]  I have no contacts whatsoever with the Kremlin, with the Russian state, with Putin's gulag.
[03:47:19.906 --> 03:47:22.409]  I did not work for Mr. Yanukovych.
[03:47:22.549 --> 03:47:29.157]  I worked in one election cycle against him for a pro-Western candidate.
[03:47:30.802 --> 03:47:41.115]  Now is as good a time as any to remind you that we at InfoWars are under siege from the tech left who seek to cut us off at the knees.
[03:47:42.036 --> 03:47:48.304]  And this is the best reason I can think of to support the InfoWars.com store.
[03:47:49.786 --> 03:48:09.318]  I particularly like this new Z-Shield toxic metal and chemical defense support formula quite simply because there are countless studies that show our food, our water, our air is loaded with toxic metals and chemicals that are weakening our immune systems and playing havoc with our long-term health.
[03:48:10.487 --> 03:48:15.569]  Even the EPA has admitted over 800 million pounds of pesticide are dumped in the U.S.
[03:48:15.670 --> 03:48:19.591]  every year, and 80% of these pesticides are used on crops.
[03:48:21.072 --> 03:48:26.955]  It's virtually impossible to avoid all of these metals and chemicals, which are really poisons.
[03:48:28.905 --> 03:48:40.795]  Thanks to InfoWars, a team of doctors and PhD herbalists and chemists spent years testing and developing a proprietary technology used by Z-Shield to cleanse the system.
[03:48:42.045 --> 03:48:47.588]  These organic ingredients are known to support the body in the fight against these toxins.
[03:48:48.528 --> 03:48:59.373]  And you're using all natural products like cilantro, shiitake, milk thistle, and other super concentrated, all natural products.
[03:49:00.194 --> 03:49:03.355]  This is one of the best products you can buy on the market.
[03:49:04.395 --> 03:49:07.257]  And I strongly urge you to go for the win-win.
[03:49:08.277 --> 03:49:14.903]  You can get an extraordinary product which will help strengthen your immune system and lead, hopefully, to greater health.
[03:49:15.344 --> 03:49:18.286]  At the same time, you can join the fight for freedom.
[03:49:18.847 --> 03:49:21.029]  You can help us fight the tech left.
[03:49:21.049 --> 03:49:23.231]  You see, they have multi-millions of dollars.
[03:49:23.651 --> 03:49:31.238]  The Googles, the Amazons, the Yahoos, the Facebooks, the Twitters, to censor us, to shut us down, to silence us.
[03:49:31.979 --> 03:49:32.860]  We have only you.
[03:49:34.284 --> 03:49:37.988]  You and your help to fight against the tech left.
[03:49:38.909 --> 03:49:54.103]  The interesting fact is that the net neutrality rules, which are currently for the FAA, which are not a guarantee against censorship, which are not what they purport to be, which are censorship,
[03:49:56.346 --> 03:50:02.672]  235,000 emails arrived at the FAA advocating the passage of Obama's rules.
[03:50:03.313 --> 03:50:07.477]  We now know every one of them came from outside the United States.
[03:50:08.197 --> 03:50:09.118]  A colossal.
[03:50:09.479 --> 03:50:11.261]  David Brock, screw up!
[03:50:12.366 --> 03:50:13.047]  Busted!
[03:50:13.568 --> 03:50:23.461]  Your whole AstroTurf attempt to cram down our throats rules that give you a monopoly on the internet, and you are busted!
[03:50:23.902 --> 03:50:25.985]  I'll be right back at InfoWars.
[03:50:56.308 --> 03:50:57.489]  Michael Schneider is our guest.
[03:50:57.850 --> 03:50:59.291]  I wasn't going to get him on about these stories.
[03:50:59.351 --> 03:51:05.337]  Baltimore has become a rotting, decaying war zone as raging opioid epidemic eats away at the city like a cancer.
[03:51:06.037 --> 03:51:13.905]  Thousands flee Chicago, drugs linked to this, for safer areas of the country as America's third largest city becomes a gang-infested wasteland.
[03:51:14.065 --> 03:51:17.768]  Yeah, a couple days ago I wrote an article which went viral on Drudge Report.
[03:51:17.788 --> 03:51:30.480]  It was posted on Drudge Report, got a ton of attention about Chicago, the third largest city in America, once one of the greatest cities in the world, has descended into basically becoming a total nightmare.
[03:51:30.640 --> 03:51:35.445]  Gang members outnumber the police in Chicago by more than a 12 to 1 margin.
[03:51:36.005 --> 03:51:45.290]  And it's thanks to unchecked illegal immigration, the Latin American gangs coming across the border are just pouring into places like Chicago and creating violence like crazy.
[03:51:45.310 --> 03:51:50.673]  In fact, just this week, the Chicago police issued an alert telling every member of the Chicago police force
[03:51:51.153 --> 03:51:53.774]  About the high-powered weapons that the gangs are using.
[03:51:54.474 --> 03:51:56.934]  Because they're just not using, you know, little pop guns.
[03:51:56.974 --> 03:51:59.895]  They're using automatic weapons in many cases.
[03:52:00.395 --> 03:52:01.975]  And so Chicago's totally out of control.
[03:52:01.995 --> 03:52:03.036]  So people are leaving.
[03:52:03.456 --> 03:52:13.418]  In fact, last year, 2016, Cook County had lost more people through domestic migration than any other county in America.
[03:52:13.438 --> 03:52:14.598]  Because people are getting out.
[03:52:15.198 --> 03:52:22.743]  And in one recent year, 2015, 3,000 millionaires, millionaires left the city of Chicago for other places.
[03:52:22.783 --> 03:52:31.349]  So people are fleeing, they're getting out, they don't want to raise their families where there's so much violence, so much crime, where things are completely out of control.
[03:52:31.569 --> 03:52:41.896]  If we see crime exploding in Chicago, the murder rate increases 60% last year, while the economy is still relatively stable, what's going to happen if we have a major downturn?
[03:52:42.416 --> 03:52:49.540]  Because, you know, right now, Alex, the number of retail bankruptcies has already surpassed all of last year.
[03:52:50.101 --> 03:52:57.805]  And if we continue at the same pace that we're on, we're going to break the all-time yearly record for store closings for retail stores by more than 20%.
[03:52:57.905 --> 03:53:02.048]  We're not just going to break the record, we're going to absolutely shatter it.
[03:53:02.228 --> 03:53:05.629]  So we've got all these economic red flags going up all around us.
[03:53:05.990 --> 03:53:10.451]  These trends started under Obama, so Obama should get the blame, but Trump's going to get the blame.
[03:53:10.731 --> 03:53:15.813]  And we've already got so much anger and frustration and racial tensions being stirred up in our inner cities.
[03:53:16.534 --> 03:53:23.456]  And when things start getting really bad, the mainstream media is just pointing it toward Trump for how bad things are.
[03:53:23.816 --> 03:53:26.738]  I mean, our cities could just explode in chaos.
[03:53:26.998 --> 03:53:27.438]  That's right.
[03:53:27.458 --> 03:53:29.859]  We've had a 50-year rot of America.
[03:53:31.038 --> 03:53:35.780]  We have brought in giant third-world populations that have no history of living in a free country or being upwardly mobile.
[03:53:35.800 --> 03:53:36.700]  They're put on welfare.
[03:53:37.000 --> 03:53:37.940]  They're made to be liberal.
[03:53:38.160 --> 03:53:39.941]  They're made to have chips on their shoulders right away.
[03:53:40.121 --> 03:53:46.123]  Trump is desperately trying to get jobs into the areas, desperately trying to create exuberance, trying to create a good attitude.
[03:53:46.143 --> 03:53:49.444]  Everybody knows with the dollar, you name it, it's all about confidence.
[03:53:49.504 --> 03:53:53.906]  And then the media is blaming him when he's desperately trying to right the ship.
[03:53:56.764 --> 03:54:01.928]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen.
[03:54:02.328 --> 03:54:05.330]  Right here, on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:05.711 --> 03:54:08.633]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:54:11.555 --> 03:54:12.436]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:54:13.777 --> 03:54:20.001]  Some Democrats call me the Prince of Darkness, and I'm back filling in for my pal Alex Jones.
[03:54:20.041 --> 03:54:22.463]  A little kickstart from the talking heads there.
[03:54:23.684 --> 03:54:24.224]  We are
[03:54:26.439 --> 03:54:28.192]  I think you're compelled to point out to you.
[03:54:28.962 --> 03:54:32.584]  That there is a rally, June 10th, in South Florida.
[03:54:33.545 --> 03:54:41.789]  This is an anti-fake news rally, which is at 3401 Hallandale Boulevard.
[03:54:42.450 --> 03:54:46.972]  It's a protest of the attempts to censor the internet.
[03:54:47.253 --> 03:54:52.456]  It is a protest of the biased coverage of Donald Trump.
[03:54:52.896 --> 03:54:55.998]  It's at the television station WPLG.
[03:54:57.379 --> 03:55:03.303]  In Hallandale Beach, actually Pembroke Beach, I believe.
[03:55:04.264 --> 03:55:09.928]  And it is vital that if you live in South Florida, you show up and be heard.
[03:55:10.428 --> 03:55:12.370]  This is going to be a patriotic rally.
[03:55:12.450 --> 03:55:13.671]  The congressional candidate
[03:55:15.054 --> 03:55:16.776]  Carla Spaulding will be speaking.
[03:55:17.056 --> 03:55:17.916]  I will be speaking.
[03:55:18.357 --> 03:55:24.461]  This is at 11 o'clock at 3401 Allendale Beach Boulevard.
[03:55:24.541 --> 03:55:26.442]  So join us there.
[03:55:27.503 --> 03:55:38.471]  I also want to yet again tell you if you have not seen the Netflix documentary Get Me Roger Stone, I strongly recommend it to you when you consider it was made
[03:55:39.051 --> 03:55:50.459]  By a bunch of left-wing hippie pinko beatnik globalist Williamsburg living leftist scum.
[03:55:51.260 --> 03:55:52.741]  They actually did a pretty good job.
[03:55:53.061 --> 03:55:55.263]  So I commend that to you.
[03:55:55.963 --> 03:56:03.189]  Once again, if you want to help the fight for freedom and give us the assist we need at InfoWars,
[03:56:04.209 --> 03:56:14.657]  I recommend to you to go to the Infowars store now and buy your copy of The Making of the President 2016.
[03:56:16.078 --> 03:56:30.908]  This is an insider's account of how the alternative conservative media with Infowars in the forefront blazed the trail that elected Donald Trump and how
[03:56:32.003 --> 03:56:39.871]  Alternative media broke the back of the mainstream media monopoly on the dissemination of political information.
[03:56:40.954 --> 03:56:48.582]  Only by having a vibrant and robust alternative media can we continue the fight for freedom.
[03:56:49.343 --> 03:56:53.988]  So folks, you can go to theinfowarsstore.com.
[03:56:54.568 --> 03:56:57.691]  You can get your copy of The Making of the President 2016.
[03:56:59.473 --> 03:57:02.937]  Or you can grab one of the first amendment-oriented t-shirts.
[03:57:03.820 --> 03:57:06.481]  You become a walking billboard for freedom.
[03:57:07.221 --> 03:57:25.384]  Whether it is the iconic Bill Clinton rape t-shirt, whether it is the Trump-Pence 2020 t-shirt, or whether it is the Hillary for prison 2017 t-shirts, these t-shirts are going to end up in the Smithsonian, folks.
[03:57:25.945 --> 03:57:27.865]  When they're gone, they're gone.
[03:57:28.405 --> 03:57:32.506]  Your grandchildren will ask you why you didn't get one and pass it down.
[03:57:34.103 --> 03:57:39.325]  In normal places in America, when you wear these, you will find like-minded souls.
[03:57:39.385 --> 03:57:48.048]  You will find others who want to make America great, who are ready to stand up to the globalists, who are ready to support us here at InfoWars.
[03:57:48.568 --> 03:57:49.948]  So get your t-shirts.
[03:57:50.468 --> 03:57:55.230]  While you're there, the non-fluoride super blue toothpaste
[03:57:56.170 --> 03:57:59.533]  Is hard to keep in stock because frankly it's so good.
[03:58:00.273 --> 03:58:03.696]  I've used all the lightning toothpaste as have the folks in my family.
[03:58:04.296 --> 03:58:05.637]  Support the fight for freedom.
[03:58:06.077 --> 03:58:07.358]  Get this fine product.
[03:58:07.779 --> 03:58:08.519]  God bless you.
[03:58:08.799 --> 03:58:12.062]  We are on the verge of a massive victory.
[03:58:12.382 --> 03:58:19.347]  We will turn back those who would impeach our president and attempt to do what they couldn't do at the ballot box.
[03:58:19.827 --> 03:58:24.831]  Defeat Donald Trump with fake rumors and innuendo and non-facts.
[03:58:25.251 --> 03:58:26.612]  About Russian collusion.
[03:58:27.212 --> 03:58:28.073]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:58:28.633 --> 03:58:30.094]  Victory or death.
[03:58:36.759 --> 03:58:40.742]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[03:58:44.778 --> 03:58:46.999]  We have two major problems in this country when it comes to spending.
[03:58:47.179 --> 03:58:49.900]  One is the warfare state, and the other is the welfare state.
[03:58:49.921 --> 03:58:54.663]  13 Alabama counties saw 85% drop in food stamp participation after work requirements reinstated.
[03:58:54.803 --> 03:58:55.323]  Go figure.
[03:58:55.423 --> 03:59:02.427]  So during the economic downturn between 2011 and 2013, several states including Alabama waived these SNAP work requirements in response to high unemployment.
[03:59:02.527 --> 03:59:06.889]  Alabama reinstated the work requirements for 54 counties on January 1st, 2016, and then for the remaining 13 on January 1st, 2017.
[03:59:09.710 --> 03:59:15.012]  Among those 13 counties, there were 5,538 adults ages 18 to 50 without dependents receiving food stamps.
[03:59:15.172 --> 03:59:18.834]  By May 1st of this year, that number had dropped to 831, a decline of 85%.
[03:59:19.714 --> 03:59:22.476]  Now remember, SNAP is essentially an electronic soup line.
[03:59:22.556 --> 03:59:26.157]  So we don't see people waiting in long lines to get food in soup kitchens, they get them on a debit card.
[03:59:26.197 --> 03:59:27.898]  Which is another way the government gets to control you.
[03:59:27.958 --> 03:59:32.880]  The Trump administration has vowed to cut food stamp rolls over the next decade, ensuring that able-bodied adult recipients are working.
[03:59:33.000 --> 03:59:34.501]  And Democrats were up in arms about this.
[03:59:34.541 --> 03:59:36.902]  But if you look at Alabama, you can see that it really does work.
[03:59:37.102 --> 03:59:38.803]  I'm all for helping people out if they need a hand.
[03:59:38.843 --> 03:59:41.805]  But I work, and there's no reason why other able-bodied people can't get out there and do the same.
[03:59:41.905 --> 03:59:44.307]  Rob Dew reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:59:47.189 --> 03:59:53.093]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
