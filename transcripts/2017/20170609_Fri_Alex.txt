[00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:07.800]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[00:00:24.972 --> 00:00:26.293]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:26.293 --> 00:00:30.057]  I'm David Knight with Owen Shroyer on this Friday, June 9th, 2017.
[00:00:30.057 --> 00:00:35.362]  We have Paul Joseph Watson who's going to be joining us in the next segment.
[00:00:35.362 --> 00:00:38.705]  He's going to break down what happened in the UK yesterday with the election.
[00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:40.627]  And of course the Conservatives
[00:00:41.528 --> 00:00:45.109]  Came out with a majority, but not enough to form a government.
[00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:47.410]  So, as they call it, it's a hung parliament.
[00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.332]  Which means that she has to create a coalition with another minority party.
[00:00:52.332 --> 00:00:58.814]  A party that wants a soft exit from the EU, not a hard exit, as they're saying.
[00:00:58.814 --> 00:01:03.776]  And so, Nigel Farage is saying it looks like this is going to be Brexit in name only.
[00:01:03.776 --> 00:01:08.618]  So we're going to talk to him about what Paul Watson sees coming forward with Brexit.
[00:01:09.318 --> 00:01:14.222]  Also, whether or not he thinks Theresa May is out or simply weakened.
[00:01:14.222 --> 00:01:16.063]  What is going to happen with Nigel Farage?
[00:01:16.063 --> 00:01:17.944]  Is he going to get back into politics?
[00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:23.068]  A lot of people have asked him if he's going to do that because UKIP took a beating yesterday.
[00:01:23.068 --> 00:01:30.553]  As many people said, apparently the British public believed that it was a done deal, they didn't need UKIP anymore.
[00:01:32.134 --> 00:01:34.915]  They might realize that they do need UKIP at this point.
[00:01:34.915 --> 00:01:43.337]  We're also going to take a look, of course, at some of the revelations that came out of the Comey hearings, some of the reactions to that, and the dog that did not bark.
[00:01:43.337 --> 00:01:51.419]  The idea that the Senate Intelligence Committee that is tasked with overseeing this massive intelligence state that we've built here, 17 agencies,
[00:01:52.759 --> 00:02:03.941]  Is turning a blind eye to things that have now been, we've had whistleblowers from the NSA like William Binney that we've talked to, the head of, global head of technical issues.
[00:02:03.941 --> 00:02:08.282]  People like that in 2001 blew the whistle and left the NSA.
[00:02:08.282 --> 00:02:09.362]  We didn't listen to them.
[00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:16.804]  Now we've got the FISA court finding that the NSA and the FBI violated the law, violated the Constitution.
[00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.411]  Nobody's doing anything about it.
[00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:20.953]  Nothing is being investigated about it.
[00:02:20.953 --> 00:02:22.574]  That is the big story.
[00:02:22.574 --> 00:02:26.657]  As Michael Hayden said, we don't listen to bad people, we listen to interesting people.
[00:02:26.657 --> 00:02:29.360]  The most interesting people are the politicians.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.326]  I think that's one of the reasons why you see people that are not necessarily even Trump allies, like Marco Rubio, come very hard after Comey.
[00:02:36.926 --> 00:02:41.828]  They understand that they are in the crosshairs as well, and so is our entire government.
[00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:52.431]  Meanwhile, we have this other issue with Reality Winner, who we now learn, Owen, that she planned to burn down the White House and pledge allegiance to the Taliban.
[00:02:52.431 --> 00:02:54.992]  This came out as part of her bail hearing, which they denied.
[00:02:54.992 --> 00:02:57.533]  They said, if we let her go, she's just going to join a foreign enemy.
[00:02:57.913 --> 00:03:01.474]  Oh, and shocking, that wasn't a Trump voter, that was a Democrat voter.
[00:03:01.474 --> 00:03:01.894]  Shocking.
[00:03:01.894 --> 00:03:03.555]  Wouldn't have discovered that.
[00:03:03.555 --> 00:03:04.315]  A Bernie supporter.
[00:03:04.315 --> 00:03:06.596]  And we got news about Bernie Sanders, too.
[00:03:06.596 --> 00:03:10.397]  And that's not his wife who's under investigation for fraud right now.
[00:03:10.397 --> 00:03:11.358]  There's new news.
[00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:15.359]  But there's an amazing psychological experiment happening right now, David, with the Brexit.
[00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:18.170]  You know, I thought that they already voted.
[00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:25.081]  If I was a citizen in Britain that voted for us to leave the European Union... See, now they want to talk about riots after last night.
[00:03:25.081 --> 00:03:26.744]  I'd already be talking riots, right?
[00:03:26.744 --> 00:03:30.950]  Okay, we already voted to leave the Brexit and our government isn't doing it!
[00:03:31.551 --> 00:03:42.000]  I'm not sitting here saying actually go out and riot, I'm just saying it's funny how now they're like, oh let's riot now and it's like, well wait a second, they're already taking our rights, we already voted, and they're trying to do the same thing in America now, David.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.145]  They say, oh here's your vote, you voted Brexit, well that's nice you voted Brexit, but we're gonna stay anyway.
[00:03:48.145 --> 00:03:53.409]  Okay here's your vote, oh you voted Trump, well that's nice you voted Trump, we're gonna go ahead and impeach him anyway.
[00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:55.350]  This is a psychological experiment.
[00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.755]  Do citizens of the world have enough spine to stand up for their own vote anymore?
[00:04:01.155 --> 00:04:05.780]  That is the experiment that we're undergoing right now, and Britain is the number one test.
[00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:14.889]  Now, of course, Theresa May is the one who called the election, and yet she, of all the people that were in the Conservative Party, she seemed to be the one who was the least committed to Brexit.
[00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:20.715]  We had people like Boris Johnson and others who were passed over, and she was selected as Prime Minister
[00:04:21.255 --> 00:04:24.638]  I was concerned about that and said so on air when she became Prime Minister.
[00:04:24.638 --> 00:04:26.720]  I said, I don't really think she's committed to Brexit.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.021]  Then she calls this election.
[00:04:28.021 --> 00:04:30.242]  Now it's very weak and now she can make the case.
[00:04:30.242 --> 00:04:31.864]  Well, you know, my hands are tied.
[00:04:31.864 --> 00:04:33.565]  I can't really do anything about it.
[00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:36.347]  We're going to be joined by Paul Joseph Watson from the UK.
[00:04:36.347 --> 00:04:38.889]  He's going to give us his closer view of this.
[00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.813]  He knows the electoral system there better than we do and what he thinks is ahead.
[00:04:42.813 --> 00:04:43.533]  Stay with us.
[00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:44.194]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.526 --> 00:05:06.332]  President Trump has a new nominee for the FBI Director, someone who was involved with the Bush administration.
[00:05:06.332 --> 00:05:11.197]  This comes after President Trump fires former FBI Director James Comey last month.
[00:05:11.197 --> 00:05:13.379]  Trump's nominee is Christopher Wray.
[00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:18.164]  In a tweet Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump calls Wray a man of impeccable credentials.
[00:05:18.764 --> 00:05:24.849]  Including serving as the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division under George W. Bush.
[00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:33.816]  Wray was integral to the DOJ's response to the attacks on September 11th, playing a role in the oversight and legal operational actions in the war on terrorism.
[00:05:33.816 --> 00:05:37.718]  And we all saw how good that turned out, possibly leading to the creation of ISIS.
[00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:43.842]  Ray was not part of the original shortlist as potential FBI directors being considered by the White House.
[00:05:43.842 --> 00:05:51.005]  But according to a source, Christopher Ray was interviewed by Mr. Trump and his name began to emerge as a strong possibility last week.
[00:05:51.005 --> 00:05:54.167]  Ray is a graduate of Yale University and Yale Law School.
[00:05:54.167 --> 00:05:58.409]  I'm Jeff Goldblatt reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:06:00.003 --> 00:06:09.093]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best-tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:06:09.093 --> 00:06:17.502]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:22.187]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:06:22.367 --> 00:06:29.150]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:36.334]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:06:36.334 --> 00:06:43.357]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:06:43.357 --> 00:06:47.839]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:51.041]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:06:51.221 --> 00:06:57.525]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great-tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:06:57.525 --> 00:07:00.007]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:00.007 --> 00:07:05.430]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue Fluoride Toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.272]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[00:07:08.272 --> 00:07:10.253]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[00:07:10.253 --> 00:07:15.096]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[00:07:15.256 --> 00:07:17.357]  Research across the board is clear.
[00:07:17.357 --> 00:07:18.638]  In fact, it's certified.
[00:07:18.638 --> 00:07:23.762]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:07:23.762 --> 00:07:30.506]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[00:07:30.646 --> 00:07:33.628]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[00:07:33.628 --> 00:07:37.330]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:44.234]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[00:07:44.234 --> 00:07:51.739]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.

[00:08:06.969 --> 00:08:15.383]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:08:22.353 --> 00:08:23.795]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:23.795 --> 00:08:27.138]  I'm David Knight with Owen Schwerer on this Friday, June 9th, 2017.
[00:08:27.138 --> 00:08:37.149]  You know, yesterday's hearings with James Comey seem to be kind of a political Rorschach's test, depending on where you are in the political spectrum.
[00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:39.933]  Actually, depending on your reaction to those hearings, we can
[00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:43.949]  I can't pinpoint you precisely as to what your political philosophy is.
[00:08:43.949 --> 00:08:53.316]  People seem to see in it what they want to see, but I think there's some real concrete things that are there that stand apart from anybody's subjective opinion of that.
[00:08:53.316 --> 00:08:57.479]  But before we get into that, we're going to talk to Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:08:57.479 --> 00:09:04.145]  There was an election in the UK yesterday, and the outcome of that election made it appear that Brexit
[00:09:04.785 --> 00:09:06.607]  May be in name only.
[00:09:06.607 --> 00:09:08.108]  That is what Nigel Farage is saying.
[00:09:08.108 --> 00:09:13.213]  So I want to get Paul Joseph Watson's comments on what happened in the election, what is ahead for Brexit especially.
[00:09:13.213 --> 00:09:16.816]  And of course we can talk about what's going on with Theresa May.
[00:09:16.816 --> 00:09:19.198]  Is she going to be weakened or is she going to be out?
[00:09:19.198 --> 00:09:23.001]  Joining us now from the UK is Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:09:23.001 --> 00:09:23.442]  Welcome Paul.
[00:09:23.442 --> 00:09:25.304]  Hey David, good to be back.
[00:09:25.304 --> 00:09:27.706]  So your comments on the election, what do you think about this?
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:48.059]  Well David, it was probably about a year ago that I warned in a tweet and said it on Alex's show, Theresa May is a globalist, she's a Remainer, she did not back Brexit, she supports Sharia law, she's the ultimate establishment leader of the Conservative Party and you couldn't trust her as far as you could throw her.
[00:09:48.059 --> 00:09:48.419]  I agree.
[00:09:48.419 --> 00:09:52.343]  So she went into this election, when she called it with a 20 point lead,
[00:09:53.917 --> 00:09:56.619]  Now her own majority has been wiped out.
[00:09:56.619 --> 00:09:58.821]  Her campaign was a complete disaster.
[00:09:58.821 --> 00:10:03.484]  There was nothing of substance whatsoever in her manifesto.
[00:10:03.484 --> 00:10:17.714]  And the outcome of it all is, whether by design or not, whether just through huge blunder at every step along the way, as he said, as Nigel Farage said, Brexit is now in danger because it weakens her hand in the negotiations.
[00:10:17.714 --> 00:10:20.016]  She's been forced into a coalition government.
[00:10:20.656 --> 00:10:30.971]  And now Labour and these other parties are going to push for a soft Brexit which is no Brexit at all because if we stay in the single market the borders remain open.
[00:10:32.356 --> 00:10:34.577]  It's basically just a tacit thing.
[00:10:34.577 --> 00:10:35.798]  It's not hard Brexit.
[00:10:35.798 --> 00:10:36.899]  It's not Brexit at all.
[00:10:36.899 --> 00:10:41.201]  So it's been a complete disaster, but many people saw it coming.
[00:10:41.201 --> 00:10:41.541]  I agree.
[00:10:41.541 --> 00:10:49.405]  As I was saying in the last segment with Owen, she was not the person in the Conservative Party that was pushing hard for Brexit.
[00:10:49.405 --> 00:10:52.787]  We had people like Boris Johnson and others, and everybody thought, oh, he's going to be the Prime Minister.
[00:10:52.787 --> 00:10:54.208]  They were passed over for her.
[00:10:54.208 --> 00:10:56.589]  And when that happened, I said, well, that's going to be a problem.
[00:10:56.589 --> 00:10:59.211]  She kept delaying, delaying, delaying, then called, as you point out.
[00:10:59.691 --> 00:11:06.197]  This election, it kind of comes across as doing a suicide bombing of Brexit.
[00:11:06.197 --> 00:11:11.861]  Like I said, James Comey kind of suicide bombed himself yesterday trying to get Donald Trump in the hearings.
[00:11:11.861 --> 00:11:22.310]  I want to play, you're talking about the campaign itself, I want to play Nigel Farage's comments on how Theresa May came across as insincere and robotic and then get your comments, Paul.
[00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.971]  Let's play that clip.
[00:11:23.923 --> 00:11:30.748]  How confident are you that there'll still be what's called the hard Brexit that you wanted, and that you think you won a year ago?
[00:11:30.748 --> 00:11:35.111]  Well, I was always a bit suspicious with Mrs May, as to whether we'd get it.
[00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:41.235]  I mean, she was asked in the campaign repeatedly, having back remain, did she now believe in Brexit?
[00:11:41.235 --> 00:11:43.797]  And not once did she say yes.
[00:11:43.797 --> 00:11:48.921]  She just said she was carrying out the will of the people.
[00:11:48.921 --> 00:11:50.582]  This may prove to be unfinished business.
[00:11:51.658 --> 00:11:53.880]  Vicar of Bray, you think she is?
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:54.902]  I do, yes.
[00:11:54.902 --> 00:11:56.824]  Victor's daughter, Vicar of Bray?
[00:11:56.824 --> 00:11:58.465]  Very much so, yes.
[00:11:58.465 --> 00:12:08.036]  And in the end, I think, when Corbyn said that they would end free movement, when Corbyn said that under Labour we would leave, I think he kind of boxed off
[00:12:08.636 --> 00:12:09.037]  I think?
[00:12:27.355 --> 00:12:31.520]  What Theresa May tried to do was to be the establishment figure.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:36.045]  Corbyn, I thought, through the campaign, looked comfortable in his own skin.
[00:12:36.045 --> 00:12:38.088]  He actually appeared to be enjoying it.
[00:12:38.088 --> 00:12:42.413]  And the Prime Minister came across as insincere and, frankly, robotic.
[00:12:43.772 --> 00:12:45.613]  Okay, so we can talk about how they campaigned.
[00:12:45.613 --> 00:12:48.335]  He said that she was insincere and robotic.
[00:12:48.335 --> 00:12:55.558]  We've seen articles from Bloomberg saying that British Millennials took revenge on their parents and their grandparents, saying they wanted to remain in.
[00:12:55.558 --> 00:13:12.608]  But I guess as we look forward, Paul, this coalition that she had to form with the DUP, the Democratic Unionist Party, which is a Northern Ireland party, they don't want a true Brexit because they have a border with Northern Ireland and they want to keep that a non-border.
[00:13:12.608 --> 00:13:12.988]  Is that correct?
[00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:20.579]  Yeah, well they support Brexit, but they say they want a soft Brexit, which again is no Brexit at all.
[00:13:20.579 --> 00:13:22.420]  On the other issues, they're not bad.
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:33.643]  The irony about the DUP is, today you have leftists bitching and whining on Twitter about how some of their members have made anti-LGBT comments in the past.
[00:13:33.643 --> 00:13:39.324]  These are people who have literally advocated for the importation of the most anti-LGBT culture
[00:13:39.904 --> 00:13:44.826]  That ever was to exist in Islam for the past, what, three, four decades.
[00:13:44.826 --> 00:13:47.287]  So they've lost their right to complain about that.
[00:13:47.287 --> 00:13:51.829]  You know, this BUP, they're anti-abortion, they're not happy about that.
[00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:57.832]  They're genuinely actually more conservative, if you want to get into pure politics, than the Conservative Party.
[00:13:57.832 --> 00:14:00.013]  So I don't think they're going to be a major problem.
[00:14:00.876 --> 00:14:08.340]  The thing that they're coming out with today, the narrative we're hearing, is this was a repudiation of anti-establishment sentiment.
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:09.421]  Absolute BS.
[00:14:09.421 --> 00:14:13.863]  Since when has Theresa May been an anti-establishment figure?
[00:14:13.863 --> 00:14:15.244]  It's complete nonsense.
[00:14:15.244 --> 00:14:20.507]  What happened, David, was UKIP was going to get crushed because they were basically a single-issue party.
[00:14:20.507 --> 00:14:24.549]  They achieved their objective at Brexit and it was where those votes were going to go.
[00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:31.575]  So the Labour Party promised in its manifesto, Jeremy Corbyn, that they would push through on a hard Brexit.
[00:14:31.575 --> 00:14:35.818]  Of course, they're not going to do that because they're politicians and lying is second nature.
[00:14:35.818 --> 00:14:40.942]  But they promised it in their manifesto and many UKIP supporters believed it.
[00:14:40.942 --> 00:14:46.667]  So some of those UKIP supporters that had come over from Labour in the past have now gone back to Labour.
[00:14:46.667 --> 00:14:50.090]  So that's partly why Labour did so well.
[00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:53.113]  So it's nothing whatsoever to do with the repudiation of Brexit.
[00:14:53.453 --> 00:15:03.378]  The only party, David, to say that they would openly sabotage Brexit was the Liberal Democrats, and they got just 7% of the vote.
[00:15:03.378 --> 00:15:07.801]  So to claim it's a repudiation of Brexit is a complete hoax.
[00:15:07.801 --> 00:15:08.601]  It's fake news.
[00:15:13.443 --> 00:15:16.065]  Jeremy Corbyn, I mean, he is absolutely terrible.
[00:15:16.065 --> 00:15:21.687]  He literally allies himself with Hamas terrorists, with IRA terrorists.
[00:15:21.687 --> 00:15:23.188]  His views are abhorrent.
[00:15:23.188 --> 00:15:26.730]  He's an open borders far-leftist.
[00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:28.511]  People say he's anti-establishment.
[00:15:28.511 --> 00:15:31.112]  Again, completely fake news.
[00:15:31.112 --> 00:15:33.713]  You know what happened a month before the election, David?
[00:15:33.713 --> 00:15:37.715]  He visited to kind of get approval for his potential leadership.
[00:15:38.375 --> 00:15:42.096]  A little group in London called the Royal Institute of International Affairs.
[00:15:42.096 --> 00:15:44.037]  Some of our leaders might have heard of it.
[00:15:44.037 --> 00:15:52.499]  That's from where the Chatham House rule, which they apply at Bilderberg, and they can't talk about anything publicly, was first initiated.
[00:15:52.499 --> 00:15:54.940]  And we know that special rule trumps everything.
[00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.761]  It trumps our Constitution and everything, doesn't it?
[00:15:57.481 --> 00:15:58.382]  The Chatham House Rules.
[00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:16.951]  What does he talk about?
[00:16:16.951 --> 00:16:19.413]  He talks about wanting a new world order.
[00:16:19.413 --> 00:16:22.737]  He talks about if he gets in power he would serve their interests.
[00:16:22.737 --> 00:16:26.800]  He says, oh I'm a pacifist but I will press the nuclear button if you ask me to.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:38.292]  So again, he's doffing his cap, he's genuflecting to actual globalists while claiming to be this anti-establishment figure that hudwinked a lot of the young voters to vote for him yesterday.
[00:16:38.985 --> 00:16:40.406]  Let's talk about the soft exit.
[00:16:40.406 --> 00:16:50.311]  Define for Americans what they really mean by that, because Theresa May drug her feet for a very long time before she would trigger the article that would begin the process.
[00:16:50.311 --> 00:16:54.353]  It's been delay, delay, delay, and now we're saying, oh, we're going to soften this.
[00:16:54.353 --> 00:16:56.194]  We don't want to have hard borders.
[00:16:56.194 --> 00:17:03.458]  Are they going to shut down any control of their borders and still allow people to freely travel as if you're part of the Schengen zone?
[00:17:03.458 --> 00:17:06.540]  What does a soft border mean with a soft exit?
[00:17:08.106 --> 00:17:18.912]  Well, it means it's basically exactly the situation we've got now whereby any citizen of the European Union can come to Britain, can get benefits, can get a job, can get housing.
[00:17:19.716 --> 00:17:24.178]  And you know, we can also go to Poland and do the same, like we'd want to do that.
[00:17:24.178 --> 00:17:27.659]  So it's a bad deal for us, but it's basically the status quo.
[00:17:27.659 --> 00:17:30.500]  It's maintaining the open borders.
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:41.144]  And even on that level, they probably wouldn't pull us out of any of the onerous bureaucracy, which makes it virtually impossible to start a business now in the UK.
[00:17:41.144 --> 00:17:42.925]  It grinds down our economy.
[00:17:42.925 --> 00:17:45.166]  We have to put more into it than we get out.
[00:17:45.166 --> 00:17:47.006]  We're ruled from Brussels.
[00:17:47.006 --> 00:17:47.947]  It's a complete mess.
[00:17:48.487 --> 00:17:49.928]  So that's what they're pushing for.
[00:17:49.928 --> 00:17:53.091]  It basically won't be any change from what we've got now.
[00:17:53.091 --> 00:17:54.373]  It will be in name only.
[00:17:54.373 --> 00:18:00.598]  And that's what we face now that Theresa May has completely messed this up.
[00:18:00.598 --> 00:18:06.384]  The other situation is now, there's an article up on Infowars.com, the leftist Corbyn supporters
[00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:11.731]  And these are the young people, some of whom are basically like the British Antifa.
[00:18:11.731 --> 00:18:13.372]  They're called Momentum.
[00:18:13.372 --> 00:18:14.652]  These are vicious thugs.
[00:18:14.652 --> 00:18:16.072]  They go out and attack people.
[00:18:16.072 --> 00:18:17.032]  They riot.
[00:18:17.032 --> 00:18:21.713]  They're now threatening riots if Theresa May forms this coalition.
[00:18:21.713 --> 00:18:30.936]  So even though Jeremy Corbyn still lost, even though he's out there claiming he won David, which is completely bizarre, his supporters are claiming they won.
[00:18:30.936 --> 00:18:31.456]  They didn't.
[00:18:31.456 --> 00:18:31.916]  They lost.
[00:18:32.396 --> 00:18:43.564]  So now they're promising riots, some of them are promising to assassinate Theresa May, and it's that same kind of butthurt that you saw after Trump won, with the leftists out rioting on the streets.
[00:18:43.564 --> 00:18:46.627]  So we might have that to look forward to this weekend.
[00:18:46.627 --> 00:18:49.028]  So you have your own parallel organizations, go ahead.
[00:18:49.028 --> 00:18:56.614]  Paul, I'm just confused because I saw that article you wrote, and you're seeing these people wanting to riot, but you already voted on the Brexit.
[00:18:56.994 --> 00:19:01.438]  Obviously the answer is leftists riot, righties don't, they go to work, conservatives work.
[00:19:01.438 --> 00:19:08.224]  But I'm just curious, when is that outrage going to exist over the fact that you voted to leave the European Union?
[00:19:08.224 --> 00:19:13.248]  When will you actually have that outrage to a vote that actually already happened?
[00:19:13.248 --> 00:19:21.495]  Well, I've heard a lot of serious commentators and even politicians say, I will be one of those out on the streets rioting if Brexit doesn't happen.
[00:19:22.179 --> 00:19:34.248]  Whether that's actually going to happen remains to be seen, because as you said, the right conservatives don't normally get out on the streets, because they're actually civilised people, they don't want to just smash things up for the sake of it and attack people.
[00:19:34.248 --> 00:19:45.377]  But Brexit supporters have said that, they said if it's not followed through on, if the timeline is not met, which is March 2019, to be completely out of the EU, then they will be out on the streets.
[00:19:45.377 --> 00:19:46.898]  So we wait to see if that happens.
[00:19:47.628 --> 00:19:48.149]  Thank you, Paul.
[00:19:48.149 --> 00:19:49.272]  I know you're feeling under the weather.
[00:19:49.272 --> 00:19:53.382]  I appreciate you getting on with us even though you have the flu and giving us your breakdown.
[00:19:53.382 --> 00:19:53.944]  Very important.
[00:19:53.944 --> 00:19:55.207]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:55.207 --> 00:19:56.650]  David Knight with Owen Schroer.
[00:20:02.179 --> 00:20:03.740]  I love sporting events.
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.361]  The atmosphere, the crowd.
[00:20:05.361 --> 00:20:07.202]  I even enjoy waiting in line.
[00:20:07.202 --> 00:20:14.085]  Because while I'm standing next to you, the RFID scanner in my pocket is capturing your personal information.
[00:20:14.085 --> 00:20:17.907]  From debit and credit cards, even your apartment building key.
[00:20:17.907 --> 00:20:21.769]  So you'll still be paying for this game long after it's over.
[00:20:23.166 --> 00:20:25.887]  Every two seconds, someone is a victim of identity fraud.
[00:20:25.887 --> 00:20:31.329]  This Father's Day, protect Dad from crimes he can't see with ID Stronghold wallets in all Dad's favorite styles.
[00:20:31.329 --> 00:20:34.631]  Bi-fold, tri-fold, and even front pocket wallets and money clips.
[00:20:34.631 --> 00:20:38.572]  ID Stronghold pioneered RFID blocking technology over 10 years ago.
[00:20:38.572 --> 00:20:42.614]  ID Stronghold wallets look great and even cost about the same as wallets in most stores.
[00:20:42.614 --> 00:20:45.655]  I'm Wal Augustinowitz, founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.

[00:20:59.474 --> 00:21:01.375]  Embrics Essentials, that's my middle name.
[00:21:01.375 --> 00:21:13.784]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic, high quality.
[00:21:13.784 --> 00:21:18.808]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country.
[00:21:19.008 --> 00:21:22.892]  That puts out high-quality organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[00:21:22.892 --> 00:21:27.517]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[00:21:27.517 --> 00:21:34.605]  It is an answer to prayer, and because we're cutting up the middleman, 20% off retail, sign up for auto ship, an additional 25% off.
[00:21:34.605 --> 00:21:35.766]  It's all there.
[00:21:35.766 --> 00:21:36.447]  The Body Wash.
[00:21:36.707 --> 00:21:41.149]  The shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it is truly game-changing.
[00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:51.854]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emrix Essentials, and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores buying it directly from InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:21:51.854 --> 00:21:54.455]  Help us win the Info War while getting products everybody needs.

[00:22:19.291 --> 00:22:20.232]  See guidelines.
[00:22:20.232 --> 00:22:23.514]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.

[00:22:58.495 --> 00:23:02.958]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[00:23:02.958 --> 00:23:04.559]  Those times may be near.
[00:23:04.559 --> 00:23:05.099]  Think about it.
[00:23:05.459 --> 00:23:10.062]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[00:23:10.062 --> 00:23:15.065]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[00:23:15.065 --> 00:23:20.869]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[00:23:20.869 --> 00:23:27.573]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[00:23:27.573 --> 00:23:30.115]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[00:23:30.555 --> 00:23:33.357]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[00:24:16.829 --> 00:24:18.211]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:18.211 --> 00:24:24.400]  I'm David Knight with Owen Schroer and Owen, we were just talking to Paul Joseph Watson about the UK election.
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:31.970]  We had someone in Theresa May who ran a very wooden, very robotic campaign as Nigel Farage characterized it.
[00:24:32.811 --> 00:24:41.461]  She did not have enough people after being tremendously ahead in the polls when she called the election after the campaigning.
[00:24:41.461 --> 00:24:50.471]  She wound up not even having enough votes to get a government together, so she has to work with another party that doesn't really want to get out of
[00:24:51.212 --> 00:24:52.932]  I don't think so.
[00:25:14.318 --> 00:25:29.003]  After the Brexit vote, even though she had come out in opposition to Brexit, and they passed over, I think it was three or four other individuals, like Boris Johnson was the obvious first choice, because he'd been such an outspoken advocate for this.
[00:25:29.003 --> 00:25:35.565]  But they passed over all these other people, or they moved them over to the side, or they withdrew, but I think it was under pressure.
[00:25:35.565 --> 00:25:38.726]  And then they put in somebody who really was not committed to it.
[00:25:39.626 --> 00:25:47.513]  And so is this kind of a soft subterfuge that we've got going in here, so they don't have a true exit from Brexit?
[00:25:47.513 --> 00:26:00.865]  The other part of it, as Paul Joseph Watson pointed out, was Jeremy Corbyn, who is the hardcore socialist leftist that was running, had said, oh no, we're all for Brexit, and yet he's going to the UK equivalent of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:26:01.585 --> 00:26:09.851]  And so he's going to this globalist organization that hates national sovereignty, meanwhile telling people publicly that he's for Brexit.
[00:26:09.851 --> 00:26:17.436]  And I think the same thing is possibly going on with Theresa May because we look at these individuals that they had in this most recent terror attack.
[00:26:17.436 --> 00:26:25.742]  There's an article on Daily Mail, flagged to MI5, arrested with a fake passport, shopped by their own mothers.
[00:26:25.742 --> 00:26:29.825]  All 18 glaring red flags that the UK security forces missed.
[00:26:30.472 --> 00:26:31.492]  They were told over and over again.
[00:26:31.492 --> 00:26:43.636]  These guys even did a documentary on the BBC about these people, and yet they're going to leave these borders open if Theresa May and the people who want a soft exit prevail here.
[00:26:43.636 --> 00:26:47.097]  Well, I'm not sure if there's any hope for Europe right now.
[00:26:47.097 --> 00:26:54.099]  Again, this is a crazy psychological experiment that's going on where they say, OK, here's your vote, but we're going to deny you the conclusion of the vote.
[00:26:54.719 --> 00:26:59.221]  And then they say March 2019 is when they're going to officially Brexit.
[00:26:59.221 --> 00:27:00.982]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:27:00.982 --> 00:27:02.503]  We voted for this years ago.
[00:27:02.503 --> 00:27:04.624]  I think that they should already be out of it.
[00:27:04.624 --> 00:27:06.465]  But, you know, this is a cycle.
[00:27:06.465 --> 00:27:07.766]  Well, we can tell them we're going to leave it.
[00:27:07.766 --> 00:27:09.747]  We're not actually going to do anything.
[00:27:09.747 --> 00:27:11.628]  And here in America, I see what the problem is.
[00:27:11.628 --> 00:27:13.229]  OK, people are obsessed with sports.
[00:27:13.229 --> 00:27:14.470]  They're obsessed with the Kardashians.
[00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:16.191]  So they don't even know what that's going on.
[00:27:16.191 --> 00:27:20.373]  But I even have more hope for people in America because at least we got not Hillary Clinton right.
[00:27:20.373 --> 00:27:21.794]  At least we got Trump right.
[00:27:21.794 --> 00:27:21.934]  Yeah.
[00:27:22.634 --> 00:27:26.197]  I don't think I have much hope for Europe, David, and I brought this story to your attention before we came on.
[00:27:26.197 --> 00:27:30.800]  And he's pulled out of the TPP, he's pulled out of the climate agreement, that's a big deal to pull out of the climate agreement.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:31.341]  Yeah, huge.
[00:27:31.341 --> 00:27:32.982]  But I'm not sure I have much hope for Europe.
[00:27:32.982 --> 00:27:37.666]  I shared this story with you before we went on air, and I know that the crew back there has it too.
[00:27:38.046 --> 00:27:44.670]  No, it's not that they all like the EU and open borders and radical Islamic terrorism being brought into their country.
[00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:47.152]  It's that they don't have kids or grandkids!
[00:28:08.206 --> 00:28:09.507]  That's right.
[00:28:09.507 --> 00:28:17.773]  None, zero of the leaders that I just mentioned in Europe have kids or grandkids.
[00:28:17.773 --> 00:28:20.054]  That really tells you something about their personality, doesn't it?
[00:28:20.054 --> 00:28:23.096]  David, I'm not somebody that has a kid.
[00:28:23.096 --> 00:28:24.577]  I'm not somebody that has grandkids.
[00:28:24.577 --> 00:28:28.400]  I do hope to one day have kids and grandkids.
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.362]  That is something that I want to do with my life one day.
[00:28:31.362 --> 00:28:33.944]  You, on the other hand, already have children.
[00:28:33.944 --> 00:28:36.406]  So I can't even imagine what
[00:28:37.186 --> 00:28:44.134]  Life and what your outlook on life and all the perspectives you have on life, how that changes when you bring a kid into the world.
[00:28:44.134 --> 00:28:49.319]  Yeah, well what you're doing is you're looking forward to the future and you have an investment in the future.
[00:28:49.319 --> 00:28:54.665]  You want to change things beyond your life, beyond the things that just immediately affect you.
[00:28:54.665 --> 00:28:57.228]  You take a longer view when you have children.
[00:28:57.868 --> 00:29:03.052]  And that's been one of the key things that was always talked about during periods of revival in the Bible.
[00:29:03.052 --> 00:29:06.735]  It would talk about how God would turn the hearts of the fathers to their children.
[00:29:06.735 --> 00:29:18.105]  If you don't have children, you're not going to be looking towards making a better society, in my opinion, because you're going to be just looking for what you can get in the immediate here and now.
[00:29:18.105 --> 00:29:21.888]  And these people who are politicians have that in spades.
[00:29:21.888 --> 00:29:24.230]  A lot of people choose to work on their careers or whatever, but
[00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:29.396]  People who are politicians, they want money and power and they want it for themselves.
[00:29:29.396 --> 00:29:30.137]  They want it now.
[00:29:30.137 --> 00:29:32.360]  They don't care about the future or anyone else.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:33.622]  It's cold, David.
[00:29:33.622 --> 00:29:34.763]  It's just cold.
[00:29:34.763 --> 00:29:35.144]  Yeah.
[00:29:35.144 --> 00:29:35.965]  It's just cold.
[00:29:35.965 --> 00:29:36.245]  It's just...
[00:29:37.358 --> 00:29:38.640]  Everything ends with me.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.521]  That's right.
[00:29:39.521 --> 00:29:40.302]  That's these people.
[00:29:40.302 --> 00:29:42.024]  It all ends with me.
[00:29:42.024 --> 00:29:42.424]  That's right.
[00:29:42.424 --> 00:29:43.205]  That's right.
[00:29:43.205 --> 00:29:48.191]  It feeds the self-centeredness and I think it really, in a politician, it really reflects a self-centeredness.
[00:29:48.191 --> 00:29:48.751]  Stay with us.
[00:29:48.751 --> 00:29:50.674]  We'll be right back with Alex Jones.
[00:29:50.674 --> 00:29:53.196]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.196 --> 00:29:55.880]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.464 --> 00:30:07.931]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[00:30:07.931 --> 00:30:21.142]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.

[00:31:01.149 --> 00:31:02.590]  Let's go to Devon in Florida.
[00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:03.892]  Devon in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:31:04.884 --> 00:31:05.364]  Great!
[00:31:05.364 --> 00:31:06.485]  Hey, thank you so much.
[00:31:06.485 --> 00:31:11.107]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[00:31:11.107 --> 00:31:20.591]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Swell, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[00:31:20.591 --> 00:31:21.511]  Wow, thank you.
[00:31:21.511 --> 00:31:23.892]  You're the top of the list that makes it all possible.
[00:31:23.892 --> 00:31:25.753]  Which nutraceuticals do you like best?
[00:31:25.753 --> 00:31:29.115]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion to be honest.
[00:31:29.115 --> 00:31:29.815]  That's amazing.
[00:31:29.915 --> 00:31:30.595]  Incredible.
[00:31:30.595 --> 00:31:33.737]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[00:31:33.737 --> 00:31:35.117]  Like, I haven't felt asleep.
[00:31:35.117 --> 00:31:36.798]  My morning was fantastic.
[00:31:36.798 --> 00:31:37.999]  And I love you guys.
[00:31:37.999 --> 00:31:40.320]  I love the InfoWars crew.
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:47.303]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[00:31:47.303 --> 00:31:48.383]  You will love it.
[00:31:48.383 --> 00:31:50.584]  I'm telling you, I've never bought a bad product.
[00:31:50.584 --> 00:31:55.086]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:31:59.534 --> 00:32:00.615]  Think about this.
[00:32:00.615 --> 00:32:13.064]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[00:32:13.064 --> 00:32:17.067]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.
[00:32:17.307 --> 00:32:21.111]  Protect your family's water supply with a trusted Big Berkey Water Filter.
[00:32:21.111 --> 00:32:31.944]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show Big Berkey Water Filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.

[00:33:00.959 --> 00:33:04.423]  InfoWars is the brainchild of radio host Alex Jones.

[00:33:44.658 --> 00:33:50.021]  Nobody can dispute the fact that you're a racist.
[00:33:50.021 --> 00:33:52.643]  InfoWars.com InfoWars comes to mind.
[00:33:52.643 --> 00:33:57.046]  InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars You watch InfoWars?
[00:33:57.046 --> 00:34:01.909]  InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars.com I want freedom!
[00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:03.049]  That's what I want!
[00:34:03.049 --> 00:34:05.231]  And that's what you should want!
[00:34:06.983 --> 00:34:13.268]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[00:34:13.268 --> 00:34:14.589]  I like that guy.
[00:34:14.589 --> 00:34:16.570]  That is the man!
[00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:27.638]  From the front lines of the Information Ward, it's Alex Jones.
[00:34:27.638 --> 00:34:32.441]  What you just saw, what you just listened to, was just a very little piece
[00:34:33.816 --> 00:34:40.081]  Of the mainstream media basically launching demonization reports against Infowars.com.
[00:34:40.081 --> 00:34:47.025]  They take our statements, they edit them, they take them out of context, they lie about us, they claim that we admit we're fake news.
[00:34:47.025 --> 00:34:48.326]  It's incredible.
[00:34:48.326 --> 00:34:53.510]  But in the last 24 hours, you've seen who is the fake news.
[00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:55.191]  I mean, it's incredible.
[00:34:55.191 --> 00:35:01.636]  We're gonna have David Knight in here, we're gonna have Owen Schroer and other guests today, and the clips of Comey yesterday.
[00:35:02.967 --> 00:35:04.849]  Destroying himself, self-destructing.
[00:35:04.849 --> 00:35:07.453]  We all saw him admit he leaked.
[00:35:07.453 --> 00:35:09.735]  We saw him admit that President Trump...
[00:35:10.754 --> 00:35:14.255]  Didn't order him to stop the Russia investigation.
[00:35:14.255 --> 00:35:25.859]  We all witnessed him admitting that he's a coward and basically a minion of the establishment and that the former Attorney General Loretta Lynch ordered him to stop criminal investigations.
[00:35:25.859 --> 00:35:27.300]  That's what's happening.
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:31.581]  But if you watch CNN or MSNBC, it's like Trump caught in lies.
[00:35:31.581 --> 00:35:33.162]  You know, this and that.
[00:35:33.162 --> 00:35:35.783]  It is incredible how they are
[00:35:37.176 --> 00:35:40.998]  Spitting that testimony, but the good news is we're here.
[00:35:40.998 --> 00:35:41.918]  We're covering it.
[00:35:41.918 --> 00:35:48.061]  We're playing the actual clips of what happened from the three-hour testimony, not just the little clips they want to twist or edit.
[00:35:48.061 --> 00:35:56.745]  We're going over all of this and we're going to do it today, one after the other, the real clips of what happened and what unfolded.
[00:35:56.745 --> 00:35:57.305]  Amazing.
[00:35:58.086 --> 00:35:59.948]  Remember Trump asked Comey, are you the leaker?
[00:35:59.948 --> 00:36:02.710]  And Comey said no, months ago.
[00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:12.458]  Trump knew he was the leaker because these are conversations only they were having and then Comey was spinning and twisting and putting out the fake memos and letting the media lie about what was in the memos.
[00:36:12.458 --> 00:36:13.119]  This is incredible.
[00:36:14.369 --> 00:36:23.632]  Now that said, before we get to this analysis and this breakdown, I want to thank you the listeners and the affiliates and the sponsors that have made this broadcast possible.
[00:36:23.632 --> 00:36:25.173]  It's been an interesting journey, to say the least.
[00:36:25.173 --> 00:36:28.674]  We're under attack, we're being demonized, just like America and President Trump is.
[00:36:28.674 --> 00:36:35.416]  But thanks to you standing with us and seeing through the lies, we are growing stronger by the day.
[00:36:36.505 --> 00:36:42.466]  So when you spread the links, the articles, the videos from InfoWars.com is an act of resistance against the globalists.
[00:36:42.466 --> 00:36:53.888]  And when you financially support us by going to InfoWarsStore.com and getting some of the amazing thousands of products that are there, it allows you to get great products that you and your family need.
[00:36:53.888 --> 00:36:57.329]  And it also allows us to continue on into the future.
[00:36:57.329 --> 00:37:00.049]  Now that said, my father is a dentist and oral surgeon.
[00:37:00.049 --> 00:37:00.890]  He's about to retire.
[00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:01.390]  He's close to 70.
[00:37:03.832 --> 00:37:11.116]  I talked to him a few years ago when he was doing consulting for us and I said, Dad, we need a product that's a game changer.
[00:37:11.116 --> 00:37:20.662]  I want it to be from a major manufacturer of organic, non-fluoride toothpaste, but our listeners want colloidal silver and they want true, clean,
[00:37:21.681 --> 00:37:22.061]  I don't
[00:37:45.166 --> 00:37:56.767]  facility every few months now they make us a new batch of super blue non-fluoride toothpaste with iodine nanosilver plus peppermint and tea tree oil so again
[00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:02.153]  One complaint I had is the tube was kind of a weird tube I hadn't seen.
[00:38:02.153 --> 00:38:07.496]  We have a more space-age, modern tube with a bigger port on the front so that you get more.
[00:38:07.496 --> 00:38:16.462]  My dad's argument was, and you may be right, you may like the old tube better, well, son, it's concentrated, there's no fillers, so we have to have a small opening so, you know, so you don't use too much.
[00:38:16.462 --> 00:38:22.046]  Well, I've decided to go with this more modern space-age tube and a larger port.
[00:38:22.046 --> 00:38:24.247]  But the point is, Super Blue is back.
[00:38:24.247 --> 00:38:26.369]  And this really shows my philosophy.
[00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:32.536]  If I do something, it's something I want, something I use, something I believe in.
[00:38:32.536 --> 00:38:41.467]  And so we have Super Blue that's organic, made in America, high quality, game-changing with colloidal silver, and of course with the iodine.
[00:38:42.597 --> 00:38:58.684]  And it supports the broadcast, it supports your teeth, it supports your gum health, it supports your heart health because the American Dental Association points out that a lot of heart problems are caused by infections in the gums, they get in your bloodstream and then to the ports and the ventricles of your heart.
[00:38:58.684 --> 00:38:59.985]  I mean, do your own research.
[00:39:00.985 --> 00:39:04.787]  Tooth health, getting them cleaned every few months, every three months at least.
[00:39:04.787 --> 00:39:06.368]  Brushing twice a day.
[00:39:06.368 --> 00:39:07.729]  Flossing is so essential.
[00:39:07.729 --> 00:39:09.730]  And so everything we do is about life.
[00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:11.631]  That's why it's Infowars Life.
[00:39:11.631 --> 00:39:17.034]  And this product, Super Blue, is from InfowarsLife.com and it's back in stock.
[00:39:17.034 --> 00:39:22.397]  And it's 33% off despite the fact that we can't even keep this in stock.
[00:39:22.397 --> 00:39:23.438]  It's so popular.
[00:39:23.438 --> 00:39:26.720]  You're helping us build the new information warfare system.
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:30.162]  You're helping us hire more crew, get more reporters, more investigative journalists.
[00:39:30.422 --> 00:39:34.206]  More fact-checkers to really take on the globalists at point-blank range.
[00:39:34.206 --> 00:39:36.268]  So again, thank you all.
[00:39:36.268 --> 00:39:40.693]  Now, I'm going to hand the baton over to Owen Schroer and David Knight and others here today.
[00:39:40.693 --> 00:39:42.215]  I'll be popping back in later.
[00:39:42.215 --> 00:39:48.061]  But again, commit to yourself to check out InfoWareStore.com because we're building a new economy.
[00:39:48.061 --> 00:39:49.342]  We're building a system where
[00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:55.414]  We don't just give our money to big globalist corporations and they use it against us.
[00:39:55.414 --> 00:40:07.205]  We're building an economy where you get high quality toothpaste at a great price and a large part of the profit from that goes into expanding an information warfare system to take on the globalists.
[00:40:07.205 --> 00:40:08.066]  We've also launched
[00:40:08.726 --> 00:40:13.508]  The new line of personal care products, Emrix Essentials, that's organic as well.
[00:40:13.508 --> 00:40:18.149]  So check that out when you visit InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:40:18.149 --> 00:40:27.152]  And again, for myself, my family, the crew, and all other freedom lovers across the world, thank you all for supporting the InfoWar, because you are the reason we're having these great victories.
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:35.062]  All right, welcome back to the live portion.
[00:40:35.062 --> 00:40:37.284]  I'm David Knight with Owen Shore.
[00:40:37.284 --> 00:40:40.506]  We want to take a look at some of the aftermath of this hearing yesterday.
[00:40:40.506 --> 00:40:45.851]  And of course, as I said earlier, it's a bit of a Rorschach's test, depending on where you are, what you see.
[00:40:45.851 --> 00:40:47.532]  Yet there really is a reality.
[00:40:47.532 --> 00:40:48.934]  I think one of the individuals that
[00:40:50.046 --> 00:40:55.710]  What was able to overcome his bias, interestingly enough, was, of all people, Chris Matthews.
[00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:58.732]  He said, the Russian collusion theory just came apart.
[00:40:58.732 --> 00:41:04.375]  He says, always been a big part of the story to me has been that the president had something to do with colluding with Russia.
[00:41:04.375 --> 00:41:09.839]  Chris Matthews said, and yet what came apart this morning was that theory.
[00:41:09.839 --> 00:41:19.025]  He said, first, we were told that Trump did not have told him to continue investigating the Russian collusion, so he's not shutting this down.
[00:41:19.645 --> 00:41:25.389]  And we also heard Comey say we have a very good investigator in terms of Mueller who's going to look into this.
[00:41:25.389 --> 00:41:27.250]  So clearly it wasn't shut down.
[00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:29.972]  So that's not an issue that they're trying to make.
[00:41:29.972 --> 00:41:31.113]  The left needs to understand that.
[00:41:31.113 --> 00:41:36.537]  And we heard over and over again the denials from Comey that Trump was being investigated.
[00:41:36.537 --> 00:41:40.640]  He said the second part being that Flynn wasn't the central part of the investigation.
[00:41:41.556 --> 00:41:44.677]  So, Chris Matthews looks at this and says, you know, there's nothing here.
[00:41:44.677 --> 00:41:56.440]  I look at it and, oh, and the thing that I'm surprised that people are not talking about, and I guess it's because it's kind of an unspoken rule in the mainstream media that you don't ever accuse important people of crimes.
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:42:04.802]  I mean, occasionally it happens with Hillary Clinton, but, you know, he gave her a pass, he gave her preferred treatment, he said there's going to be one standard of
[00:42:05.362 --> 00:42:06.242]  We're good to go.
[00:42:35.114 --> 00:42:42.097]  And then on the monitor behind him, he thought it was a joke because he sees the news saying that he's just been fired.
[00:42:42.097 --> 00:42:43.398]  He didn't know that he'd been fired.
[00:42:43.398 --> 00:42:48.580]  So this guy was very bitter, very angry, as angry as some kind of a jihadi suicide bomber.
[00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:50.881]  And he goes in and essentially, I think, blew himself up.
[00:42:52.859 --> 00:42:58.861]  Committing perjury because he'd already under oath said that nobody had ever pressured him politically to shut down an investigation.
[00:42:58.861 --> 00:43:04.823]  Then he implied that very as strongly as he could to say well when he said I hope that you'll shut this down.
[00:43:04.823 --> 00:43:09.225]  He and Angus King said well that's kind of like Thomas Beckett.
[00:43:09.605 --> 00:43:14.987]  When he was killed by the King, Henry II, who said, who will rid me of this turbulent priest?
[00:43:14.987 --> 00:43:17.688]  And they understood what he wanted, they did that for him.
[00:43:17.688 --> 00:43:23.371]  So, he's saying, you're telling me that you really want this done, that's exactly what you want, but it's not hope.
[00:43:23.371 --> 00:43:26.692]  We have another comment on this from Camilla Harris, but your comments first.
[00:43:26.932 --> 00:43:40.477]  Well, I think that Comey had a little help strapping on the suicide bomb via the Clinton crime cabal that he's involved with, and the Democrat anti-Trumpers just in government to begin with.
[00:43:40.477 --> 00:43:44.199]  So I think he had a little bit of help strapping on that suicide bomb.
[00:43:44.199 --> 00:43:46.119]  He was not a lone wolf terrorist.
[00:43:48.161 --> 00:43:58.530]  And who knows if he even wanted to go out there and blow himself up or if there was just so much pressure from his little Clinton buddies to go out there and push this Russia-Trump narrative.
[00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:05.837]  But like you said, what really ended up happening was he ended up suiciding politically himself by admitting he was the leaker.
[00:44:05.837 --> 00:44:11.983]  And then I think a big thing that nobody seems to be talking about is that James Comey admits
[00:44:13.083 --> 00:44:18.147]  That he doesn't know the source of the Russian DNC hack.
[00:44:18.147 --> 00:44:23.752]  He admitted that there is a third party source that he is not allowed to know.
[00:44:23.752 --> 00:44:25.533]  He can't get the intel.
[00:44:25.533 --> 00:44:28.756]  He says he just trusts it.
[00:44:28.756 --> 00:44:32.379]  That it was Russia that hacked the DNC and the DCCC.
[00:44:32.379 --> 00:44:34.661]  So he says, basically, the FBI
[00:44:35.902 --> 00:44:39.283]  Is relying on third-party intel that is Russia.
[00:44:39.283 --> 00:44:44.604]  CrowdStrike, which is a DNC contractor and they've never even turned over the servers for him to look at it.
[00:44:44.604 --> 00:44:47.284]  So it's like he's the FBI but he can't see their servers?
[00:44:47.284 --> 00:44:48.684]  It's like, come on.
[00:44:48.684 --> 00:44:53.485]  This is the patronage that he was accusing Donald Trump of.
[00:44:53.485 --> 00:44:57.346]  He is being patronized by the Clintons.
[00:44:57.346 --> 00:45:01.567]  But now you're seeing, I think, people, I mean they're losing people like Chris Matthews.
[00:45:01.567 --> 00:45:02.447]  People are slowly
[00:45:03.766 --> 00:45:09.330]  Losing this leftist, because they see the people around them are absolutely bat crap crazy!
[00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:10.551]  And Kamala Harris is one of them.
[00:45:10.551 --> 00:45:12.052]  Nancy Pelosi is one of them.
[00:45:12.052 --> 00:45:12.752]  Let's play the clip.
[00:45:12.752 --> 00:45:18.656]  Kamala Harris, I thought that they had, they kind of flirted with her being the next big thing in politics.
[00:45:18.656 --> 00:45:20.517]  Kind of like they flirted with Cory Booker.
[00:45:20.517 --> 00:45:22.679]  And I thought both of them landed flat on their face.
[00:45:22.679 --> 00:45:25.241]  But they're trying to rejuvenate Kamala Harris.
[00:45:25.241 --> 00:45:30.024]  And she thinks, and the Democrats think, that she got a lot of momentum from these Comey hearings.
[00:45:30.544 --> 00:45:34.647]  I don't think that that is real momentum, but this is a clip we have of Kamala Harris.
[00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:57.621]  Not going to require you to answer.
[00:45:57.621 --> 00:46:13.729]  I just want to make a statement that in my experience of prosecuting cases, when a robber held a gun to somebody's head and said, I hope you will give me your wallet, the word hope was not the most operative word at that moment.
[00:46:13.729 --> 00:46:16.570]  But you don't have to respond to that point.
[00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:17.350]  Because it's so absurd?
[00:46:18.931 --> 00:46:19.151]  Yeah.
[00:46:19.151 --> 00:46:21.074]  So, it's just ridiculous, David.
[00:46:21.074 --> 00:46:23.458]  Yeah, I wonder how many robbers have ever said that.
[00:46:23.458 --> 00:46:26.923]  I hope you give me your wallet as they're pointing a gun to you.
[00:46:26.923 --> 00:46:29.687]  Well, here's Kamala Harris, just a character summary.
[00:46:29.687 --> 00:46:30.969]  That's stretching the word.
[00:46:30.969 --> 00:46:31.871]  Summary.
[00:46:31.871 --> 00:46:34.455]  This is the type of woman who just gets off with herself.
[00:46:34.855 --> 00:46:38.457]  The type of woman who just looks in the mirror and says, look at me and how great I am.
[00:46:38.457 --> 00:46:39.858]  Kind of like an Obama.
[00:46:39.858 --> 00:46:40.838]  Kind of that type of person.
[00:46:40.838 --> 00:46:46.281]  Looks at herself as a virtue signaling social justice warrior and she thinks that's going to lift her to the top.
[00:46:46.281 --> 00:46:48.102]  Really doesn't care about helping people.
[00:46:48.102 --> 00:46:50.443]  Really doesn't care about the overall general public.
[00:46:50.443 --> 00:46:54.845]  Just as long as her image is good and she can be self-righteous at the end of the day.
[00:46:54.845 --> 00:46:55.626]  That's Kamala Harris.
[00:46:56.386 --> 00:47:08.294]  I actually had a conversation with the editor at WorldNetDaily when I was at Bilderberg, and he says he is completely convinced, 100%, that it's Kamala Harris they're going to put for the next presidential candidate for the Democrats.
[00:47:08.294 --> 00:47:09.455]  I'm saying no way.
[00:47:09.455 --> 00:47:10.436]  She's too weak.
[00:47:10.436 --> 00:47:11.516]  She's too crazy.
[00:47:11.516 --> 00:47:15.559]  She's already had multiple outbursts where she breaks into cursing outrages.
[00:47:15.559 --> 00:47:16.059]  There's no way.
[00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:17.470]  I guess.
[00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:20.473]  Well, she doesn't have a history and she's female, but I think there's a lot of... Exactly.
[00:47:20.473 --> 00:47:23.556]  She's an African-American female, so you know that they're going to try to run with that.
[00:47:23.556 --> 00:47:28.500]  And I think that maybe there's something to that, that that's where the Democrats might go.
[00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:29.481]  She's a weak candidate.
[00:47:29.481 --> 00:47:30.281]  She's terrible.
[00:47:30.281 --> 00:47:34.085]  I think that America's gotten over the identity politics, and I think it'll fail again.
[00:47:34.085 --> 00:47:34.665]  No, they haven't.
[00:47:34.665 --> 00:47:35.446]  No, they haven't.
[00:47:35.446 --> 00:47:36.967]  But there's kind of a part of me that says maybe not.
[00:47:36.967 --> 00:47:38.008]  The Democrats haven't gotten over it.
[00:47:38.008 --> 00:47:39.690]  That's going to be their go-to moment.
[00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:44.213]  Well, the Democrats haven't even gotten over President Bush yet, David.
[00:47:44.213 --> 00:47:44.813]  That's right.
[00:47:44.813 --> 00:47:46.254]  Let's take a look at some of the geezers here.
[00:47:46.254 --> 00:47:53.399]  We had Nancy Pelosi had a senior moment today, just as we saw Senator McCain having a senior moment.
[00:47:53.399 --> 00:47:55.801]  Everybody's talking about that.
[00:47:55.801 --> 00:47:57.963]  That's one thing I think everybody saw was how
[00:47:58.823 --> 00:48:04.748]  Out of it, Senator McCain-wise, have us an argument for term limits, or at least cognitive tests.
[00:48:04.748 --> 00:48:07.389]  Or apparently ending baseball games earlier.
[00:48:07.389 --> 00:48:11.653]  Let's take a look at Nancy Pelosi's senior moment that she just had.
[00:48:11.653 --> 00:48:18.698]  New Yorkers have said to me, those who've had business dealings with him, he operates this way.
[00:48:18.698 --> 00:48:20.619]  First, he tries to charm you.
[00:48:20.619 --> 00:48:22.661]  President Bush tries to charm you.
[00:48:22.661 --> 00:48:25.183]  If that doesn't work, he tries to bully you.
[00:48:26.007 --> 00:48:27.209]  She doesn't get it.
[00:48:27.209 --> 00:48:27.749]  Look at her eyes.
[00:48:40.586 --> 00:48:41.886]  I said sit, President Bush.
[00:48:41.886 --> 00:48:47.508]  I'm sorry, I meant to say... They had to walk up and hand her a note because she keeps talking... She still can't even think of it!
[00:48:47.508 --> 00:48:48.528]  She still can't think of it!
[00:48:48.528 --> 00:48:51.629]  I apologize.
[00:48:51.629 --> 00:48:53.809]  So what, she's done this five times now?
[00:48:53.809 --> 00:48:56.210]  She should have finished that up by saying, please applaud.
[00:49:00.231 --> 00:49:02.052]  So, it's just amazing.
[00:49:02.052 --> 00:49:07.673]  You know, you would think after you made the mistake the first time, the second time, the third time that you would get it, it's President Trump.
[00:49:07.673 --> 00:49:09.994]  But no, this woman has a brain disorder.
[00:49:09.994 --> 00:49:12.315]  She has a genuine mental disorder.
[00:49:12.315 --> 00:49:13.395]  She has dementia.
[00:49:13.395 --> 00:49:20.017]  And David and I, we were talking about before the segment, you know, I don't want to come out here and have to make fun of John McCain and Nancy Pelosi.
[00:49:20.017 --> 00:49:20.737]  I mean, that hurts.
[00:49:20.737 --> 00:49:21.177]  I have a soul.
[00:49:21.177 --> 00:49:22.518]  I don't mind doing that.
[00:49:22.518 --> 00:49:23.458]  But they're in the ring.
[00:49:23.458 --> 00:49:24.858]  I mean, what are we supposed to do?
[00:49:24.858 --> 00:49:26.439]  We have to call these people out as the mental
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:30.243]  Incapable people they are to have these positions.
[00:49:30.243 --> 00:49:33.707]  These are people who think that they should run our lives and they can't even speak.
[00:49:33.707 --> 00:49:37.191]  But let's talk about something that is on point I think.
[00:49:37.191 --> 00:49:40.515]  Something that was not talked about and that is again the crimes.
[00:49:40.515 --> 00:49:46.422]  James Comey has given contradictory testimony on two different occasions under oath.
[00:49:46.422 --> 00:49:47.063]  That's perjury.
[00:49:47.563 --> 00:49:56.008]  James Comey did the same thing that he was investigating Hillary Clinton for, and that is keeping his own private computer records and so forth that he doesn't have in the system.
[00:49:56.008 --> 00:50:02.631]  He could have memorialized this and made sure that people understood that it was contemporaneous with his discussions.
[00:50:02.631 --> 00:50:08.134]  Instead, we don't hear anything about it until after he's fired, quite a bit of the time after he's fired.
[00:50:08.334 --> 00:50:14.096]  If he is accusing President Trump of obstruction of justice, then he becomes an accessory to that.
[00:50:14.096 --> 00:50:17.577]  And then there's something else that I think that is even far more serious.
[00:50:17.577 --> 00:50:26.681]  And that is that he did absolutely nothing to rein in the FBI as they were violating the law that's just been exposed by the FISA court acting as a whistleblower.
[00:50:26.681 --> 00:50:27.201]  And then this.
[00:50:28.061 --> 00:50:39.394]  We had Senator Grassley, on multiple occasions, write him about his connections with the man, Christopher Steele, who created the dirty dossier, asking for information.
[00:50:39.394 --> 00:50:40.335]  It was ignored.
[00:50:40.335 --> 00:50:42.277]  He came back and he said, I want to know
[00:50:43.058 --> 00:50:44.999]  I want documentation of all the payments.
[00:50:44.999 --> 00:50:46.580]  You've ignored this for months.
[00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:49.962]  He said, what are the payments that the FBI made to Mr. Steele?
[00:50:49.962 --> 00:50:53.705]  Did you know that he was involved as an unregistered Russian agent?
[00:50:53.705 --> 00:50:55.286]  The company that he was working with?
[00:50:55.286 --> 00:50:57.287]  When did you become aware of that, if you ever did?
[00:50:57.287 --> 00:50:59.268]  Those are real legal issues.
[00:50:59.268 --> 00:51:00.309]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:51:00.569 --> 00:51:03.351]  A big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[00:51:03.351 --> 00:51:11.395]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[00:51:11.395 --> 00:51:13.316]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.
[00:51:13.316 --> 00:51:16.979]  Get the original and most trusted name in gravity water filtration, Big Berkey.
[00:51:16.979 --> 00:51:21.641]  And now GCN listeners receive 5% off ceramic filter systems using code GCN.
[00:51:21.641 --> 00:51:26.044]  Call or click 1-877-99-BERKEY or bigberkeywaterfilters.com.
[00:51:26.044 --> 00:51:26.524]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[00:51:30.126 --> 00:51:34.167]  Nearly one third of FBI domestic terrorism cases involve refugees.
[00:51:34.167 --> 00:51:35.247]  One third.
[00:51:35.247 --> 00:51:37.268]  There's already been riots across Europe.
[00:51:37.268 --> 00:51:38.468]  Is America next?
[00:51:38.468 --> 00:51:40.748]  Hi, I'm the owner of Infidel Body Armor.
[00:51:40.748 --> 00:51:45.949]  Over the past four years, I've sold thousands of body armor kits and trained hundreds of sheepdogs.
[00:51:45.949 --> 00:51:47.270]  They have prepared.
[00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:48.270]  Have you?
[00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:52.951]  I invite you to go to my website at infidelbodyarmor.com and click on specials.
[00:51:52.951 --> 00:51:54.111]  Trouble is coming.
[00:51:54.111 --> 00:51:55.631]  Now do something about it.
[00:51:55.631 --> 00:51:58.652]  Infidelbodyarmor.com just won't quit.
[00:51:59.512 --> 00:52:10.082]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:52:10.082 --> 00:52:12.123]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:52:12.123 --> 00:52:14.966]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:52:14.966 --> 00:52:16.467]  It's made in the USA.
[00:52:16.467 --> 00:52:19.570]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[00:52:19.810 --> 00:52:23.235]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:52:23.235 --> 00:52:25.318]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:52:25.318 --> 00:52:34.851]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:52:34.991 --> 00:52:44.473]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[00:52:44.473 --> 00:52:51.675]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[00:52:51.675 --> 00:52:54.976]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[00:52:54.976 --> 00:52:58.097]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Field and fullwarslive.com.
[00:52:58.877 --> 00:53:00.498]  Hi, my name's Tim Forehand.
[00:53:00.498 --> 00:53:01.678]  I'm a Deputy Sheriff.
[00:53:01.678 --> 00:53:03.999]  In my job, keeping in shape is important.
[00:53:03.999 --> 00:53:09.141]  I've tried other products to get my weight down, but nothing has worked like Android 400.
[00:53:09.141 --> 00:53:14.663]  In just three months, I've dropped 51 pounds, down from 230 to 179.
[00:53:14.663 --> 00:53:17.944]  Plus, the weight's come off in the stomach area.
[00:53:17.944 --> 00:53:23.847]  I've gone from a snug 36-inch waist to a 32-inch waist, which I was in high school.
[00:53:23.847 --> 00:53:26.908]  I highly recommend the Android 400 to all my friends.
[00:53:26.908 --> 00:53:27.228]  Guys,
[00:53:27.708 --> 00:53:34.311]  Are you frustrated because no matter how hard you try, it seems impossible to lose stubborn belly fat?
[00:53:34.311 --> 00:53:39.733]  Then discover why thousands of men each month rely on Andro 400.

[00:53:55.822 --> 00:53:56.003]  0 4 3 5
[00:54:08.959 --> 00:54:10.340]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:11.700]  I'm David Knight with Owen Schroer.
[00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:20.205]  We're going to be joined in the next hour by Matt Dubiau of WCKG in Chicago, our affiliate there.
[00:54:20.205 --> 00:54:23.347]  He's got some interesting information about Bernie Sanders.
[00:54:23.347 --> 00:54:27.329]  I've got a clip I want to play of Bernie Sanders here taking on somebody
[00:54:28.149 --> 00:54:34.271]  And saying that he should not be allowed in the government because Bernie Sanders can't get him to deny his Christian faith.
[00:54:34.271 --> 00:54:35.231]  I'm going to play that for you.
[00:54:35.231 --> 00:54:40.873]  That's going to be a nice intro to Bernie Sanders we're going to be talking about in the second hour.
[00:54:40.873 --> 00:54:47.956]  But before we do that, real quickly, I want to remind you that we have BioTruth Selenium now 25% off while supplies last.
[00:54:47.956 --> 00:54:56.999]  And of course, if you know anything about your health and the things that you need to maintain a healthy body, you know the importance of selenium.
[00:54:57.739 --> 00:55:03.764]  It supports the thyroid gland, it supports the immune system, it supports the DNA production and eyesight.
[00:55:03.764 --> 00:55:12.592]  So there's a lot of very well documented benefits from selenium and the fact that you have to have a sufficient amount of that in your diet.
[00:55:12.592 --> 00:55:18.416]  We don't get that type of thing in most of our domestic diets in the West today.
[00:55:18.416 --> 00:55:23.881]  But the question is, not whether or not you need selenium as a supplement, but what kind of form are you going to have?
[00:55:23.881 --> 00:55:25.823]  Are you going to get a synthetic selenium?
[00:55:26.363 --> 00:55:30.689]  Biotruselenium is made from 100% organic mustard seed.
[00:55:30.689 --> 00:55:37.719]  So, once you identify the types of things that you need in your diet, it's very important to pay attention to the quality of the source.
[00:55:37.719 --> 00:55:39.261]  That's why we made this 100% organic from mustard seed.
[00:55:41.604 --> 00:55:42.985]  That's our BioTrue Selenium.
[00:55:42.985 --> 00:55:46.068]  It is now 25% off while supplies last.
[00:55:46.068 --> 00:55:52.695]  And also, our new line of Emrix Essentials, the organic household products that you'll find at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:55:52.695 --> 00:55:57.439]  Everything from sunscreen, bug spray, mouthwash, body wash, shampoo, natural deodorant.
[00:55:57.439 --> 00:56:05.667]  You'll find that and many other things at InfoWarsStore.com, part of the new Emrix Essentials line of organic household products.
[00:56:06.368 --> 00:56:10.631]  Now this is a short segment, so I want to play this clip from Bernie Sanders.
[00:56:10.631 --> 00:56:16.995]  This is a confirmation hearing for someone who is an Office of Management and Budget nominee.
[00:56:16.995 --> 00:56:20.937]  And Bernie Sanders has a problem with this man's religion.
[00:56:20.937 --> 00:56:22.178]  We have a First Amendment.
[00:56:22.178 --> 00:56:25.220]  He has a right to exercise his religion.
[00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:29.883]  He doesn't have to give that up if he's a government employee, but Bernie Sanders thinks he should.
[00:56:29.883 --> 00:56:30.383]  Here's that clip.
[00:56:30.763 --> 00:56:40.911]  In the piece that I referred to that you wrote for a publication called Resurgent, you wrote, quote, Muslims do not simply have a deficient theology.
[00:56:40.911 --> 00:56:48.096]  They do not know God because they have rejected Jesus Christ, his son, and they stand condemned.
[00:56:48.096 --> 00:56:51.079]  End of quote.
[00:56:51.079 --> 00:56:53.961]  Do you believe that that statement is Islamophobic?
[00:56:55.146 --> 00:56:56.887]  Absolutely not, Senator.
[00:56:56.887 --> 00:57:03.573]  I'm a Christian, and I believe in a Christian set of principles based on my faith.
[00:57:03.573 --> 00:57:18.685]  That post, as I stated in the questionnaire to this committee, was to defend my alma mater, Wheaton College, a Christian school that has a statement of faith, that includes the centrality of Jesus Christ for salvation, and... Again, I apologize.
[00:57:18.685 --> 00:57:19.926]  Forgive me.
[00:57:19.926 --> 00:57:20.967]  We just don't have a lot of time.
[00:57:21.667 --> 00:57:25.331]  Do you believe that people in the Muslim religion stand condemned?
[00:57:25.331 --> 00:57:26.512]  Is that your view?
[00:57:26.512 --> 00:57:31.296]  Again, Senator, I'm a Christian, and I wrote that piece... Well, what does that say?
[00:57:31.296 --> 00:57:34.719]  Do you think Bernie would ask him about the same thing about this Christian man?
[00:57:34.719 --> 00:57:35.740]  How many Muslims there are in America?
[00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:36.341]  I really don't know.
[00:57:36.341 --> 00:57:37.161]  Probably a couple of million.
[00:57:37.982 --> 00:57:41.243]  Are you suggesting that all of those people stand condemned?
[00:57:41.243 --> 00:57:42.064]  What about Jews?
[00:57:42.064 --> 00:57:43.925]  They stand condemned too.
[00:57:43.925 --> 00:57:46.246]  Senator, I'm a Christian.
[00:57:46.246 --> 00:57:51.228]  I understand you are a Christian, but this country is made up of people who are not just.
[00:57:51.228 --> 00:57:53.909]  I understand that Christianity is the majority religion.
[00:57:53.909 --> 00:57:55.990]  All right, we're running out of time, so let me summarize this.
[00:57:56.690 --> 00:58:08.484]  He went on to say, when Bernie Sanders eventually let him talk, he said that as a Christian, I believe all individuals are made in the image of God, and are worthy of dignity and respect regardless of their religious beliefs.
[00:58:08.484 --> 00:58:11.808]  I believe that as a Christian, that's how I should treat all individuals.
[00:58:12.489 --> 00:58:20.311]  Bernie Sanders doesn't realize that the First Amendment was written by founders who quoted the Bible, who were Christians.
[00:58:20.311 --> 00:58:23.032]  They based that on Christian principles.
[00:58:23.032 --> 00:58:31.515]  We have an open pluralistic society, unlike Islam, where they try to combine religion and state.
[00:58:31.515 --> 00:58:36.836]  That is a distinctly idea that is Christian, that we want people to have that freedom of choice.
[00:58:36.836 --> 00:58:37.297]  Stay with us.
[00:58:37.297 --> 00:58:40.337]  When we come back, we'll talk more about this.
[00:58:40.337 --> 00:58:41.838]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:43.826 --> 00:58:46.016]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[00:58:51.007 --> 00:58:52.868]  Here's something you won't hear on the fake news.
[00:58:52.868 --> 00:58:58.691]  According to the Daily Caller, Trump's approval rating is actually higher than Bill Clinton's was at the same point in his presidency.
[00:58:58.691 --> 00:59:08.155]  That's despite all the negative media attention, the wild goose hunt over bogus charges of Russia's involvement in the election, and the unending chorus of anti-Trump talking heads on network news.
[00:59:08.155 --> 00:59:12.997]  Even the liberal rag Newsweek magazine had to admit Trump's approval rating was better than Bill Clinton's at 160 days in.
[00:59:14.218 --> 00:59:21.902]  While Trump's approval rating is only hovering around the 40% mark, he's still doing better than Clinton, who only had 37% approval at 138 days in.
[00:59:21.902 --> 00:59:27.906]  Of course, Trump's disapproval rating is also higher than Clinton's, at 57% compared to Clinton's 49%.
[00:59:27.906 --> 00:59:28.927]  But what do you expect?
[00:59:28.927 --> 00:59:33.169]  Bill Clinton was lauded as the poster boy of everything cool about modern liberalism.
[00:59:33.169 --> 00:59:38.712]  Meanwhile, Trump and his family have been put under a microscope and have been under constant assault even before he got elected.
[00:59:38.712 --> 00:59:40.013]  Despite all the negativity,
[00:59:40.273 --> 00:59:45.379]  Trump's numbers continue to climb, which is proof that the fake media's narrative is dying.
[00:59:45.379 --> 00:59:52.688]  Reporting for InfoWars.com, I'm Jay Michaels.
[00:59:52.688 --> 00:59:55.291]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:17.284]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:17.284 --> 01:00:23.468]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:42.392 --> 01:00:43.772]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:43.772 --> 01:00:48.134]  I'm David Knight with Owen Schroer on this Friday, June 9th, 2017.
[01:00:48.134 --> 01:00:56.336]  We were playing that clip with Bernie Sanders attacking a guy who's been nominated for a position in the Office of Management and Budget.
[01:00:56.336 --> 01:00:59.076]  He's working on dollars and cents.
[01:00:59.076 --> 01:01:01.957]  And Bernie doesn't think that he should be allowed to do that.
[01:01:01.957 --> 01:01:03.938]  He doesn't like the fact that this guy has
[01:01:06.022 --> 01:01:10.325]  Christian beliefs, and he wants him to deny those Christian beliefs.
[01:01:10.325 --> 01:01:17.429]  So we have a First Amendment that was put there by Christians that says that you can practice anything that you want.
[01:01:17.429 --> 01:01:19.751]  That's a Christian idea.
[01:01:19.751 --> 01:01:22.993]  Those are the Christian principles that founded this country.
[01:01:22.993 --> 01:01:26.775]  That idea of tolerance that they are now turning against us.
[01:01:26.775 --> 01:01:31.758]  And here's how they're turning against us, and here's why we're going to be talking in the next segment to Matt Dubiel.
[01:01:31.758 --> 01:01:32.118]  He is
[01:01:33.439 --> 01:01:43.664]  The General Manager of our affiliate in Chicago, WCKG Radio, there's going to be a People's Summit being run by Bernie Sanders in Chicago.
[01:01:43.664 --> 01:01:46.805]  We're going to talk to Matt Dubiel in the next segment.
[01:01:46.805 --> 01:01:52.048]  At this People's Summit, which is running today through Sunday, they want to limit
[01:01:52.788 --> 01:01:54.769]  White attendees.
[01:01:54.769 --> 01:01:56.310]  So Bernie Sanders has a problem.
[01:01:56.310 --> 01:01:58.212]  He doesn't want Christians in the government.
[01:01:58.212 --> 01:02:02.275]  He doesn't want white people coming to his People's Summit.
[01:02:02.275 --> 01:02:06.097]  This guy doesn't understand tolerance.
[01:02:06.097 --> 01:02:09.800]  He doesn't understand the Christian principles that this country was based on.
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:12.441]  He's not going to get that kind of tolerance in an Islamic country.
[01:02:12.441 --> 01:02:15.724]  There aren't any Islamic countries that have the First Amendment, Owen.
[01:02:15.724 --> 01:02:17.085]  They don't have anything like that.
[01:02:17.085 --> 01:02:18.706]  Instead they have Sharia law.
[01:02:19.286 --> 01:02:33.991]  That is based on a combination of state and religion, and you would think somebody that is such a watchdog about anything like that would be concerned about the combination of religion and state that we see endemic in Islamic countries.
[01:02:33.991 --> 01:02:41.613]  Well, let's not forget about his wife that is currently under an FBI investigation for bank fraud, but we'll just leave that aside.
[01:02:41.613 --> 01:02:43.494]  And Bernie made a million dollars from the book.
[01:02:43.494 --> 01:02:47.015]  He should have done what Hoffman did, Abbie Hoffman, when he said, steal this book.
[01:02:47.415 --> 01:02:51.017]  You know, that's what a real socialist communist would do, but Bernie cashed in.
[01:03:17.815 --> 01:03:21.396]  No, but see, I think in his mind, being Jewish gives him a pass.
[01:03:21.396 --> 01:03:22.036]  Is that what it is?
[01:03:22.036 --> 01:03:24.016]  Because he's not, you know, white white.
[01:03:24.016 --> 01:03:24.876]  He's not a white Christian.
[01:03:24.876 --> 01:03:26.937]  It's really white Christians that he has a problem with.
[01:03:26.937 --> 01:03:38.359]  That would make sense because when he made that statement during the presidential debates where he said white people don't know what it's like to be poor, he must have forgotten about all the Jewish people in the concentration camps that were starved to death.
[01:03:38.359 --> 01:03:38.659]  That's right.
[01:03:38.659 --> 01:03:41.039]  He must have just forgotten about those white people.
[01:03:41.039 --> 01:03:45.040]  But it's amazing because, again, like I was saying with Chris Matthews,
[01:03:46.101 --> 01:03:58.082]  The crazier the left gets, the more insane their behavior is, the more insane their rhetoric is, the more intolerant they are, not letting white people in, wanting to separate this, that, the other thing, the whole thing is based on racial politics.
[01:03:58.956 --> 01:04:08.003]  The less support they're going to get, more people who are completely clueless to any of this or who really don't care about politics cannot help but get sucked in.
[01:04:08.003 --> 01:04:13.707]  This gravitational pull of Trump really is what has done it, of politics now, this gravitational pull.
[01:04:13.707 --> 01:04:17.169]  Everybody's getting pulled in and they're seeing the left for what it is.
[01:04:17.169 --> 01:04:18.911]  The frauds like Bernie Sanders.
[01:04:18.911 --> 01:04:20.892]  The racists like Bernie Sanders.
[01:04:22.193 --> 01:04:24.454]  They're not endearing themselves to anybody.
[01:04:24.454 --> 01:04:29.796]  They're only going to suffer more defeat in 2018, 2020, if they don't change course.
[01:04:29.796 --> 01:04:41.401]  But all signs point to them staying course, preaching tolerance when we're the most intolerant, preaching, you know, don't be basing people on their race while they play racial politics all day long.
[01:04:41.401 --> 01:04:46.463]  They're just losing any stand that they have left, and they're going to continue to lose, and I'm not sick of winning.
[01:04:47.386 --> 01:04:51.147]  He wants to purge anybody who has a Christian belief out of government.
[01:04:51.147 --> 01:04:55.889]  He would have purged out George Washington, Patrick Henry, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and the rest of the founders.
[01:04:55.889 --> 01:04:57.810]  He wants to purge white people out of his meeting.
[01:04:57.810 --> 01:05:00.691]  We're going to talk to the station owner about what's happening in Chicago.
[01:05:00.691 --> 01:05:06.493]  President Trump has a new nominee for the FBI director, someone who was involved with the Bush administration.
[01:05:06.493 --> 01:05:11.355]  This comes after President Trump fires former FBI director James Comey last month.
[01:05:11.355 --> 01:05:13.296]  Trump's nominee is Christopher Wray.
[01:05:13.516 --> 01:05:25.005]  In a tweet Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump calls Wray a man of impeccable credentials, including serving as the assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division under George W. Bush.
[01:05:25.005 --> 01:05:33.972]  Wray was integral to the DOJ's response to the attacks on September 11th, playing a role in the oversight and legal operational actions in the war on terrorism.
[01:05:33.972 --> 01:05:37.654]  And we all saw how good that turned out, possibly leading to the creation of ISIS.
[01:05:38.715 --> 01:05:43.998]  Ray was not part of the original shortlist as potential FBI directors being considered by the White House.
[01:05:43.998 --> 01:05:51.161]  But according to a source, Christopher Ray was interviewed by Mr. Trump and his name began to emerge as a strong possibility last week.
[01:05:51.161 --> 01:05:54.323]  Ray is a graduate of Yale University and Yale Law School.
[01:05:54.323 --> 01:05:58.565]  I'm Jeff Goldblatt reporting for InfoWars.com and InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:06:00.202 --> 01:06:02.082]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[01:06:02.082 --> 01:06:04.123]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[01:06:04.123 --> 01:06:07.004]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[01:06:07.004 --> 01:06:13.085]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[01:06:13.085 --> 01:06:22.268]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[01:06:22.268 --> 01:06:27.129]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children.
[01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:29.791]  Do the best job you can to purify your air.
[01:06:29.791 --> 01:06:37.817]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[01:06:37.817 --> 01:06:38.798]  The general public doesn't.
[01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:43.954]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[01:06:43.954 --> 01:06:47.517]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[01:06:47.517 --> 01:06:54.242]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[01:06:54.242 --> 01:06:58.326]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at m4warstore.com.
[01:07:00.333 --> 01:07:06.836]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[01:07:06.836 --> 01:07:19.621]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[01:07:19.821 --> 01:07:23.482]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[01:07:23.482 --> 01:07:30.465]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[01:07:30.465 --> 01:07:43.330]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[01:07:43.330 --> 01:07:44.871]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[01:07:45.171 --> 01:07:51.557]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[01:07:51.557 --> 01:07:59.445]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:07:59.445 --> 01:08:04.511]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[01:08:07.253 --> 01:08:12.756]  Who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[01:08:12.756 --> 01:08:21.281]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[01:08:21.281 --> 01:08:32.748]  The Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign to influence voters in the election.
[01:08:32.748 --> 01:08:34.269]  And then they began to weaponize them.
[01:08:35.049 --> 01:08:50.998]  And they began to have some of their allies within the internet world, like InfoWars, take out pieces and began to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[01:08:50.998 --> 01:08:53.719]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[01:08:53.719 --> 01:09:00.123]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, your reputation is amazing, I will not let you down.
[01:09:02.802 --> 01:09:05.469]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:09:05.469 --> 01:09:10.623]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:09:12.990 --> 01:09:14.451]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:09:14.451 --> 01:09:25.939]  Owens Royer, David Knight filling in for Alex on this Friday and we are about to be joined by Matt Dubiel who has a inside scoop on a Bernie Sanders event today.
[01:09:25.939 --> 01:09:33.565]  We're gonna get that scoop to you in a couple segments but first let's bring on Matt Dubiel to talk about this Bernie event.
[01:09:33.985 --> 01:09:34.906]  Matt, you heard about this.
[01:09:34.906 --> 01:09:36.788]  You brought this to our attention.
[01:09:36.788 --> 01:09:40.271]  And the biggest story here is that Bernie Sanders is holding this event.
[01:09:40.271 --> 01:09:42.853]  He's trying to limit white people from attending it.
[01:09:42.853 --> 01:09:45.676]  Therefore, I'm assuming Bernie Sanders is not attending the event.
[01:09:47.425 --> 01:09:48.645]  He's not allowed to go.
[01:09:48.645 --> 01:09:50.586]  Let me tell you something, Owen.
[01:09:50.586 --> 01:09:53.367]  I don't want to allow my own self to go to my own event.
[01:09:53.367 --> 01:09:58.048]  You know, in fairness, I don't know if it's Bernie's event.
[01:09:58.048 --> 01:10:01.009]  I'm using rock and roll quotes for people who can't see me.
[01:10:01.009 --> 01:10:02.749]  I didn't even know about this event.
[01:10:02.749 --> 01:10:04.229]  And here's what you got to understand.
[01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:06.330]  In Chicago, McCormick Place,
[01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:12.353]  is this huge center in downtown Chicago where they have the auto show every year.
[01:10:12.353 --> 01:10:20.637]  They have thousand person events at this place and I got a call actually a Facebook message from a patriot here in Chicagoland.
[01:10:20.637 --> 01:10:31.943]  Her name is Rachel and she was so inspired by the the last couple years and the election globally and the election nationally that she got involved in her local township.
[01:10:31.943 --> 01:10:33.924]  She's now a I believe a committee person and
[01:10:34.404 --> 01:10:36.326]  And she got elected in office.
[01:10:36.326 --> 01:10:38.087]  This is what everybody should be doing, by the way.
[01:10:38.087 --> 01:10:40.208]  She got involved.
[01:10:40.208 --> 01:10:41.409]  And this is where it matters.
[01:10:41.409 --> 01:10:53.598]  And I know, David, you talk about this all the time, but it's sexy, it's exciting to hear and think about national politics and international affairs, but really, granularly, where things matter is on your home turf.
[01:10:53.598 --> 01:11:00.523]  So Rachel got involved on her home turf, and she messaged me a couple weeks ago, and she said, hey, Matt, there's this event.
[01:11:00.523 --> 01:11:01.784]  The circus is coming to town.
[01:11:01.784 --> 01:11:03.105]  I mean, this thing is a freak show.
[01:11:04.544 --> 01:11:07.845]  They cancelled the Barnum and Bailey Circus, and now I know why.
[01:11:07.845 --> 01:11:14.987]  Because when you look at what's going on at the People's Summit here in Chicago, let me tell you, okay, so Bernie, Bernie's going to be there.
[01:11:14.987 --> 01:11:18.108]  Bernie is going to be allowed to come.
[01:11:18.108 --> 01:11:23.209]  And I think his wife, I'm not sure if the lady that is mentioned is Jane Sanders, his wife?
[01:11:23.925 --> 01:11:27.707]  Yeah, James Sanders is his wife, currently being investigated for bank fraud.
[01:11:27.707 --> 01:11:30.488]  Okay, so she's white, by the way.
[01:11:30.488 --> 01:11:35.330]  I mean, I don't know if you guys can see it on your screen, but she's definitely white.
[01:11:35.330 --> 01:11:38.051]  Here's the guy that you can't miss, okay?
[01:11:38.051 --> 01:11:45.694]  And this, by the way, everybody who wants to go to this event, they may not let you in if you're white, and that's not what I have experienced, that's what I've heard.
[01:11:45.694 --> 01:11:50.376]  I've heard that they're sort of trying to keep it diverse, and so they're throttling people out.
[01:11:50.376 --> 01:11:52.517]  Hey, we've got too many white people here, we've got too many white people.
[01:11:52.557 --> 01:11:53.198]  We're good to go.
[01:12:12.552 --> 01:12:18.896]  Where, especially at the McCormick Place, you're going to have more speakers than attendees, I believe.
[01:12:18.896 --> 01:12:28.942]  But I want to tell you, if you're thinking about going to this event in Chicago, it's happening this weekend, if you weren't considering it, there's a reason why you gotta go.
[01:12:28.942 --> 01:12:29.443]  Okay?
[01:12:29.443 --> 01:12:30.904]  And you guys, I know you're both sitting down.
[01:12:30.904 --> 01:12:32.464]  Are you ready for this?
[01:12:32.464 --> 01:12:34.025]  Remember Toy Story?
[01:12:34.025 --> 01:12:35.847]  Remember the dinosaur in Toy Story?
[01:12:37.068 --> 01:12:38.349]  Okay, he's gonna be there.
[01:12:38.349 --> 01:12:42.113]  The guy that voiced the dinosaur in Toy Story, Wallace Shawn.
[01:12:42.113 --> 01:12:42.694]  You can see him.
[01:12:42.694 --> 01:12:44.215]  He's a goofy guy with glasses, right?
[01:12:44.215 --> 01:12:45.016]  He's got a goofy glasses.
[01:12:45.016 --> 01:12:46.397]  My dinner with Andre.
[01:12:46.397 --> 01:12:48.960]  Yeah, so it could be my dinner with Bernie, right?
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:49.701]  Yes, dinner.
[01:12:49.701 --> 01:12:51.983]  He's in pretty much every Pixar movie.
[01:12:51.983 --> 01:12:53.184]  He's a voice in every Pixar movie.
[01:12:53.184 --> 01:12:53.765]  Dinner with Bernie.
[01:12:54.378 --> 01:12:58.942]  He was Mr. Incredible's boss in The Incredibles, this Wallace Shaw guy.
[01:12:58.942 --> 01:13:00.163]  Yeah, there he is!
[01:13:00.163 --> 01:13:02.365]  There he is, yes, that's him.
[01:13:02.365 --> 01:13:03.887]  Yes, he's got that sort of whiny voice.
[01:13:03.887 --> 01:13:05.328]  Van Jones is going to be there?
[01:13:05.328 --> 01:13:05.909]  T-Rex.
[01:13:05.909 --> 01:13:07.170]  Oh, Van Jones!
[01:13:07.170 --> 01:13:08.591]  My boy, Van Jones.
[01:13:08.591 --> 01:13:10.753]  Van Jones and me, we're tight.
[01:13:10.753 --> 01:13:12.154]  Van Jones got your job here.
[01:13:12.154 --> 01:13:14.637]  Thank you.
[01:13:14.637 --> 01:13:16.298]  Thank you, Van.
[01:13:16.298 --> 01:13:16.899]  It gets better.
[01:13:17.592 --> 01:13:21.415]  Okay, the guy that played Zuckerberg on Facebook is going to be there.
[01:13:21.415 --> 01:13:22.156]  Also in Zombieland.
[01:13:22.156 --> 01:13:23.697]  So a bunch of nobodies.
[01:13:23.697 --> 01:13:27.501]  So I'm not a Silicon Valley shill, I just play one in the movies, right?
[01:13:27.501 --> 01:13:28.442]  Right.
[01:13:28.442 --> 01:13:33.206]  And I know we're on the radio, but Danny, Danny, I'm too old for this, blank.
[01:13:34.026 --> 01:13:34.926]  We're good to go.
[01:13:49.995 --> 01:13:53.539]  I believe that events like these are good.
[01:13:53.539 --> 01:14:02.327]  Because anytime people are getting involved in things, getting educated, seeing what the other side says, seeing what is being talked about, that's good.
[01:14:02.327 --> 01:14:05.851]  What's dangerous here is this Linda Sarsour.
[01:14:05.851 --> 01:14:07.532]  Sarsour is going to be there?
[01:14:07.532 --> 01:14:07.592]  Yes.
[01:14:10.902 --> 01:14:15.586]  She is, and she's buried in the second row with the dinosaur from Toy Story.
[01:14:15.586 --> 01:14:17.567]  But you can see her right there.
[01:14:17.567 --> 01:14:19.509]  And she's a dangerous person.
[01:14:19.509 --> 01:14:28.736]  Because the fundamental, if you read what this event is about in Chicago, they're saying that it's for the people and it's supposed to be designed, you know, I was reading the description on the front page.
[01:14:29.276 --> 01:14:41.745]  Uh, at a time of tremendous turmoil and progressive opportunity, we invite you to participate in a historic convening of organizations and individuals committed to social, racial, and economic justice.
[01:14:41.745 --> 01:14:43.707]  So, you know... Hashtag resistance!
[01:14:44.367 --> 01:14:52.154]  Yeah, to people who have Coexist stickers on their cars and Feel the Burn stickers on their cars, it sounds like it's gonna be pretty rockin', right?
[01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:54.396]  It sounds like, well, this is something I wanna get behind.
[01:14:54.396 --> 01:14:58.779]  Let me get my Ben & Jerry's ice cream, let me go down to this event, and let me have a good time.
[01:14:58.779 --> 01:15:02.262]  But, when you slip people in, like Sarsour...
[01:15:03.283 --> 01:15:11.990]  That's when it gets dangerous, because as you, as we know, and as people that are paying attention to some of the things you guys are covering, she's a bad lady.
[01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:13.211]  She's into some naughty things.
[01:15:13.211 --> 01:15:16.874]  Well, I gotta tell you though, you know, Chicago is a tough town.
[01:15:16.874 --> 01:15:27.503]  People in Chicago don't like getting pushed around, and I feel like if Linda Sarsour comes out and she starts preaching, you know, radical Islamic tolerance and Sharia law and this stuff,
[01:15:28.143 --> 01:15:31.445]  I don't think people in Chicago are going to buy that crap, to be perfectly honest with you.
[01:15:31.445 --> 01:15:33.826]  I think people are going to start walking out of that speech.
[01:15:33.826 --> 01:15:38.528]  You know, I think it's an interesting connection between these lefties and Islam that keeps coming up.
[01:15:38.528 --> 01:15:47.072]  We just played the clip of Bernie Sanders, so concerned that an appointee to OMB would have written about his Christian faith.
[01:15:47.532 --> 01:15:52.636]  He thinks that disqualifies him because it's exclusive to his Muslim friends.
[01:15:52.636 --> 01:15:57.379]  And now we got reality winner, a Bernie Sanders supporter, saying she wants to burn down the White House.
[01:15:57.379 --> 01:16:00.962]  This is what they said when she came up for her bail hearing.
[01:16:00.962 --> 01:16:02.202]  The judge denied bond.
[01:16:02.202 --> 01:16:07.146]  The prosecutor said that the only thing that she would do if she was released was to probably be recruited by the nation's enemies.
[01:16:07.506 --> 01:16:14.952]  She said she wanted to burn down the White House, she wanted to travel to Afghanistan, she pledged her allegiance to the Taliban, and then we got Linda Sarsour doing that same type of stuff.
[01:16:14.952 --> 01:16:30.045]  I mean, this is something that we increasingly see, even though you would think that these feminists would be radically opposed to this radical, male-only religion that is connected to the state.
[01:16:30.045 --> 01:16:36.330]  They just keep ignoring all of these connections that are diametrically opposed to everything that they say they support.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:50.907]  Well and to me that's where it's dangerous because while I believe that we should let everyone speak and when we let everyone speak we can hear whose ideas are worth carrying on and accepting and whose ideas are BS crazy.
[01:16:50.907 --> 01:16:54.889]  When we hear that we can make those decisions but here's what's dangerous about this.
[01:16:54.889 --> 01:16:59.771]  This is the frog in the boiling pot of water and when you go to an event
[01:17:00.311 --> 01:17:15.181]  Like this and you're just a Great American and you have a coexist sticker and you really got inspired by Bernie and you like some of his ideas Which if you look at some of his ideas, they're very in line with a lot of what Trump stood for in a lot of ways There's many many parallels.
[01:17:15.181 --> 01:17:25.588]  So you have people in each dimension You know the dimension a people that love Trump and they go I'm up for this people in dimension B that love Bernie and they're going well I'm for the same thing they go to this event and
[01:17:26.108 --> 01:17:36.095]  And then they have this Trojan horse effect where Sarsour and others like her, Van Jones, are sort of implanting and turning up the heat on the boiling water.
[01:17:36.095 --> 01:17:40.577]  And before you know it, those ideas seem like they're not so nutty.
[01:17:40.577 --> 01:17:42.559]  And I'll give you a great example of this.
[01:17:42.559 --> 01:17:49.463]  This is exactly what I've heard from people who have had experiences with groups like Scientology.
[01:17:49.463 --> 01:17:50.844]  And I have not personally.
[01:17:51.124 --> 01:18:00.249]  But I've heard from people who have been in those groups where they start out, they read this book or they read some idea and they go, you know what, that idea makes a lot of sense.
[01:18:00.249 --> 01:18:06.552]  And then they get escalated through some things that make some sense into some wacky, wacky stuff.
[01:18:06.552 --> 01:18:10.253]  And before you know it, they've got wacky ideas in their head.
[01:18:10.253 --> 01:18:13.555]  And this is the reason why my grandmother didn't want me listening to
[01:18:13.615 --> 01:18:19.579]  Rock and roll music, for instance, because the fear back then was, oh, they're going to plant ideas in your head.
[01:18:19.579 --> 01:18:21.800]  So there's a slippery slope here.
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:25.442]  I'm not saying we should start getting all crazy and start censoring things.
[01:18:25.442 --> 01:18:30.706]  However, what needs to happen is people need to know what Linda Sarsour stands for.
[01:18:30.706 --> 01:18:41.753]  They need to know that when they're doing a woman's march and they think they're standing for one thing, they're actually standing beside somebody who stands for the complete polar opposite.
[01:18:42.253 --> 01:18:42.733]  That's right.
[01:18:42.733 --> 01:18:43.794]  It's very malleable.
[01:18:43.794 --> 01:18:46.496]  They don't have a core set of beliefs.
[01:18:46.496 --> 01:19:03.027]  So as you're pointing out, they can be drawn in by some innocuous things and then these radical beliefs can be presented to them and because they don't have a core center, because they don't have a foundation, they can quickly be moved over to the other side and they can turn into a reality winner who wants to
[01:19:03.527 --> 01:19:04.208]  Burn down the house.
[01:19:04.208 --> 01:19:06.530]  We should have the talking heads thing when we come back in here.
[01:19:06.530 --> 01:19:07.631]  Burning down the house.
[01:19:07.631 --> 01:19:09.672]  Bernie down the house.
[01:19:09.672 --> 01:19:11.734]  I think that they do have a core belief.
[01:19:11.734 --> 01:19:14.296]  I think they do have a common core and that's anti-Trump.
[01:19:14.296 --> 01:19:15.457]  That's stop Trump.
[01:19:15.457 --> 01:19:16.919]  They hate Trump.
[01:19:16.919 --> 01:19:19.321]  It doesn't matter if it's Sarsour that you put in front of them.
[01:19:19.321 --> 01:19:20.802]  It doesn't matter if it's Bernie Sanders.
[01:19:20.802 --> 01:19:21.803]  They hate white people.
[01:19:21.803 --> 01:19:22.583]  They hate Christians.
[01:19:22.583 --> 01:19:23.744]  They hate the foundation of this country.
[01:19:24.845 --> 01:19:29.047]  And Bernie and Van Jones comes out and says that this was a white lash.
[01:19:29.047 --> 01:19:31.368]  You know, President Trump getting elected was a white lash.
[01:19:31.368 --> 01:19:33.488]  That's the type of stuff that Matt is talking about.
[01:19:33.488 --> 01:19:35.409]  Turning up the heat in the boiling pot.
[01:19:35.409 --> 01:19:37.270]  Turning up the heat on that water.
[01:19:37.270 --> 01:19:39.571]  Trying to get things to boil over.
[01:19:39.571 --> 01:19:43.672]  And we're going to actually have, when we come back, we're going to have even more of an inside scoop.
[01:19:43.672 --> 01:19:46.093]  I'll just go ahead and tell you, we've got boots on the ground.
[01:19:46.093 --> 01:19:48.014]  Matt DuBile is with us right now.
[01:19:48.014 --> 01:19:51.435]  We will be right back with live action from Bernie Sanders.
[01:19:51.915 --> 01:19:53.277]  People's Summit!

[01:20:59.366 --> 01:21:01.308]  Embrics Essentials, that's my middle name.
[01:21:01.308 --> 01:21:13.700]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic, high quality.
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:18.725]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country.
[01:21:18.905 --> 01:21:22.789]  That puts out high-quality organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[01:21:22.789 --> 01:21:27.414]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.

[01:22:03.681 --> 01:22:07.442]  A sinister murder in Oregon that is still unsolved and shrouded in mystery.
[01:22:07.442 --> 01:22:09.003]  Yet no one seems to care.
[01:22:09.003 --> 01:22:11.163]  Are the Oregon police covering something up?
[01:22:11.163 --> 01:22:13.624]  Are Illuminati and the New World Order involved?
[01:22:13.624 --> 01:22:15.845]  Who really killed Tiffany Jenks?
[01:22:15.845 --> 01:22:17.406]  A story waiting to be told.
[01:22:17.406 --> 01:22:19.127]  A story that will not go away.

[01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:09.281]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:24:09.281 --> 01:24:11.543]  Owen Stroyer, David Knight, filling in for Alex.
[01:24:11.543 --> 01:24:18.807]  We are joined by Matt Dubiel from WCKG in Chicago, a huge supporter of InfoWars.
[01:24:18.807 --> 01:24:21.329]  Thank you, Matt Dubiel, for all of your great work.
[01:24:21.329 --> 01:24:30.075]  He is with us, and now we are also joined by Rachel Lawrence, who is actually on the ground at the Bernie Sanders People's Summit event.
[01:24:30.795 --> 01:24:35.818]  Reality Winner thought that she could use her white privilege to get out of her crime.
[01:24:35.818 --> 01:24:42.681]  Ironically, the world doesn't work like that, and Reality Winner had to face that reality, well, in jail.
[01:24:42.681 --> 01:24:44.182]  Reality Loser.
[01:24:44.182 --> 01:24:45.083]  Reality Loser.
[01:24:45.083 --> 01:24:49.105]  So now let's go to Rachel Lawrence, who is actually white.
[01:24:49.105 --> 01:24:51.826]  Somehow, how did you get into the People's Summit event?
[01:24:51.826 --> 01:24:52.807]  How is this possible?
[01:24:52.807 --> 01:24:54.808]  I'm having a hard time hearing you.
[01:24:54.808 --> 01:24:56.149]  I can't hear you at all right now.
[01:24:57.714 --> 01:25:02.959]  Alright, well we'll try to get her audio figured out, but Bernie Sanders has an event today called the People's Summit.
[01:25:02.959 --> 01:25:05.361]  It's been said that they're trying to limit white people.
[01:25:05.361 --> 01:25:09.485]  I would imagine they're really trying to do that to limit photo opportunities.
[01:25:09.485 --> 01:25:13.749]  They want to have pictures taken and make it look like a hugely diverse crowd.
[01:25:13.749 --> 01:25:14.370]  That would be my...
[01:25:15.851 --> 01:25:17.512]  I guess as to why they're trying to do that.
[01:25:17.512 --> 01:25:20.134]  We're going to try to re-link up with Rachel.
[01:25:20.134 --> 01:25:29.741]  I just want to share with everyone listening about what Rachel has done in her life.
[01:25:29.741 --> 01:25:31.182]  It's really inspiring.
[01:25:31.182 --> 01:25:38.907]  Rachel is a mother, maybe of two or three, a wife, and an independent woman, and she lives in the suburbs here.
[01:25:38.907 --> 01:25:41.869]  And during the course of the last election, she made a decision
[01:25:41.909 --> 01:25:42.109]  I think?
[01:25:59.591 --> 01:26:00.572]  And that's what she did.
[01:26:00.572 --> 01:26:02.394]  She got involved in one way.
[01:26:02.394 --> 01:26:06.798]  And before you know it, that led to her finding out new information and learning new things.
[01:26:06.798 --> 01:26:12.124]  She found out about the rampant corruption in her township, Algonquin Township.
[01:26:12.124 --> 01:26:13.265]  That's the key thing.
[01:26:13.265 --> 01:26:18.110]  You gotta be inside before you can see what these guys are really doing behind closed doors.
[01:26:18.510 --> 01:26:21.793]  It's like getting into Bilderberg when you get into the local council area.
[01:26:21.793 --> 01:26:27.398]  They talk about how you have to, we've always heard from the left, think globally, act locally.
[01:26:27.398 --> 01:26:31.281]  We need to understand what's going on globally, but we also need to act locally.
[01:26:31.281 --> 01:26:37.346]  And it's just the sort of thing where we can't cover that as a national news group, all the little millions of things that are happening locally.
[01:26:37.346 --> 01:26:38.207]  That's very important.
[01:26:38.647 --> 01:26:41.889]  It's hugely important because that's where the big things happen.
[01:26:41.889 --> 01:26:44.451]  They're little things, but they lead to big things.
[01:26:44.451 --> 01:26:46.392]  And so as an example, she ran for office.
[01:26:46.392 --> 01:26:47.853]  Now she's a trustee.
[01:26:47.853 --> 01:26:50.235]  Now she's in a position to effect some change.
[01:26:50.235 --> 01:26:51.996]  Now she reaches out to me last week.
[01:26:51.996 --> 01:26:55.078]  And by the way, we became friends online because of that.
[01:26:55.078 --> 01:26:56.559]  Because I started seeing what she was doing.
[01:26:56.559 --> 01:27:00.022]  I think she might have seen what we were doing and watching what you all were doing.
[01:27:00.022 --> 01:27:01.242]  And she reached out.
[01:27:01.242 --> 01:27:02.283]  And that's how it started.
[01:27:02.283 --> 01:27:05.205]  She said, hey Matt, I'm going to go to this event.
[01:27:05.205 --> 01:27:07.607]  If you guys get the ticket and get me in,
[01:27:08.067 --> 01:27:11.790]  Then I'll cover it and I said, well let me connect you with InfoWars and here we go now.
[01:27:11.790 --> 01:27:14.352]  Talking about connecting, I think we've got her back now.
[01:27:14.352 --> 01:27:16.173]  Can you hear us, Rachel?
[01:27:16.173 --> 01:27:16.974]  Yes, I can.
[01:27:16.974 --> 01:27:19.195]  Tell us a little bit about what you're seeing there.
[01:27:19.195 --> 01:27:20.276]  Thank you so much for doing this.
[01:27:20.276 --> 01:27:23.158]  We're just talking about how important it is for people to get involved locally.
[01:27:23.158 --> 01:27:24.679]  You're a great example of this.
[01:27:24.679 --> 01:27:28.182]  Give us an overview of what you see here and what the issue is with this event.
[01:27:29.087 --> 01:27:34.711]  Well, actually, so far what I've seen, everything starts about 1 o'clock.
[01:27:34.711 --> 01:27:38.654]  If you look to my right behind me, you'll see the registration area.
[01:27:38.654 --> 01:27:41.637]  Technically, nothing actually starts.
[01:27:41.637 --> 01:27:47.501]  The workshops actually begin around 1 in the afternoon, but we've already seen a big rush.
[01:27:47.501 --> 01:27:52.485]  Registration opened at 10 a.m., so I've seen probably a
[01:27:53.049 --> 01:27:56.432]  A few hundred people registered already, including myself.
[01:27:56.432 --> 01:27:58.313]  This is a huge venue, Matt was telling us.
[01:27:58.313 --> 01:28:02.477]  They've got a lot of well-known celebrities, and they're doing this for several days.
[01:28:02.477 --> 01:28:03.397]  It's running today.
[01:28:03.397 --> 01:28:04.298]  It's just the beginning.
[01:28:04.298 --> 01:28:06.179]  You're talking about this is just registration.
[01:28:06.179 --> 01:28:07.340]  It's going to be all day tomorrow.
[01:28:07.340 --> 01:28:09.582]  It's going to be Sunday as well, right?
[01:28:09.582 --> 01:28:10.383]  Right.
[01:28:10.383 --> 01:28:12.104]  I'll be here all three days.
[01:28:12.104 --> 01:28:12.705]  Wow.
[01:28:12.705 --> 01:28:15.287]  And they let you in even though you were white.
[01:28:15.287 --> 01:28:16.147]  They did.
[01:28:16.147 --> 01:28:17.368]  That's the issue, right?
[01:28:17.368 --> 01:28:21.131]  That's actually one of the most fascinating things that I've seen.
[01:28:22.469 --> 01:28:29.970]  I heard about it actually because somebody on social media had shared that they were going or shared a link to it.
[01:28:29.970 --> 01:28:32.031]  And I was like, I've never heard of it.
[01:28:32.031 --> 01:28:41.692]  So I clicked on the link and I read about it and it surprised me that you need to A, apply to buy a ticket.
[01:28:41.692 --> 01:28:44.353]  B, the ticket is $100.
[01:28:44.353 --> 01:28:46.793]  It includes box lunch.
[01:28:46.793 --> 01:28:49.454]  It includes workshops.
[01:28:49.454 --> 01:28:50.974]  It's sponsored basically.
[01:28:53.356 --> 01:28:55.081]  Well, you can pass because you're female.
[01:28:55.081 --> 01:28:57.508]  I guess Bernie can pass because he's Jewish, right?
[01:28:57.508 --> 01:28:58.752]  How can Bernie be charging?
[01:28:58.752 --> 01:28:59.755]  I thought everything was free!
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:10.808]  Well, you know what, this is actually technically the answer I've heard, and I've had conversations with several people so far already, who were actually very nice, by the way.
[01:29:10.808 --> 01:29:22.999]  But several people said it's actually, the People's Summit is actually separate from, this isn't an actual Bernie rally as much as it seems that way, and pretty much it virtually is.
[01:29:23.969 --> 01:29:30.512]  Um, but, uh, technically the People's Summit runs it, and some of the sponsors actually kind of surprised me.
[01:29:30.512 --> 01:29:33.613]  I saw moveon.org as one of the sponsors.
[01:29:33.613 --> 01:29:35.214]  Oh yeah, shocking!
[01:29:35.214 --> 01:29:36.154]  Back me over with a feather.
[01:29:37.958 --> 01:29:43.779]  And then Reclaim Chicago, just to name a few.
[01:29:43.779 --> 01:29:45.159]  We've got to go to break, but stay there.
[01:29:45.159 --> 01:29:48.940]  We're going to be right back with Rachel Lawrence, Inside the People's Summit.
[01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:52.801]  And Matt Dubial, WCKG.
[01:29:52.801 --> 01:30:03.122]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:03.122 --> 01:30:04.563]  Let's go to David in Florida.
[01:30:04.563 --> 01:30:05.803]  David in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:30:06.795 --> 01:30:07.255]  Great!
[01:30:07.255 --> 01:30:08.376]  Hey, thank you so much.

[01:30:22.166 --> 01:30:23.047]  Wow, thank you.

[01:30:25.329 --> 01:30:26.970]  Which Nutraceutical does you like best?
[01:30:27.210 --> 01:30:30.691]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[01:30:30.691 --> 01:30:31.971]  That's really incredible.
[01:30:31.971 --> 01:30:35.012]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[01:30:35.012 --> 01:30:36.373]  Like, I haven't felt sleep.
[01:30:36.373 --> 01:30:38.033]  My morning was fantastic.
[01:30:38.033 --> 01:30:39.274]  And I love you guys.

[01:33:35.624 --> 01:33:36.044]  Look into the
[01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:42.221]  I mean, you need selenium, folks.
[01:33:42.221 --> 01:33:44.121]  Most people are deficient in selenium.
[01:33:44.121 --> 01:33:53.525]  Not only do we sell selenium here, we sell it at a discounted price and the best quality selenium you can find, bio-true selenium from the mustard seed.
[01:33:53.525 --> 01:34:01.769]  Just do a little research for yourself, you will see that this is probably the best selenium that you can find and definitely the best price, especially right now on sale for $15.
[01:34:01.769 --> 01:34:02.869]  That is like a steel 4.8
[01:34:04.710 --> 01:34:08.434]  We've had over 700 views and it's got a 4.8 rating, folks.
[01:34:08.434 --> 01:34:11.537]  That just tells you that this stuff is the real deal.
[01:34:11.537 --> 01:34:14.519]  Also, we've got the new line of Emmerich's Essentials.
[01:34:15.566 --> 01:34:18.847]  And I gotta tell ya, I've been using these products.
[01:34:18.847 --> 01:34:23.889]  I was actually used myself to shoot a commercial for these products.
[01:34:23.889 --> 01:34:27.530]  I'm sure that you'll be seeing that before too long.
[01:34:27.530 --> 01:34:30.311]  But I will tell ya... Do we get to watch you in the shower?
[01:34:30.311 --> 01:34:31.071]  If you're lucky.
[01:34:31.071 --> 01:34:32.011]  If you're lucky.
[01:34:32.011 --> 01:34:35.312]  But I gotta tell ya, the shampoo is no joke.
[01:34:35.312 --> 01:34:37.093]  That shampoo is some amazing stuff.
[01:34:37.093 --> 01:34:38.233]  You got the deodorant.
[01:34:38.233 --> 01:34:40.994]  I'm already using aluminum-free deodorant.
[01:34:40.994 --> 01:34:42.575]  I'm gonna switch over to Emmerich Essentials.
[01:34:43.195 --> 01:34:48.300]  But all natural sunscreen, all natural bug spray, all natural, folks.
[01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:49.021]  Let me tell you something.
[01:34:49.021 --> 01:34:51.464]  I actually gotta say, my dad lives out in the woods.
[01:34:51.464 --> 01:34:52.545]  He does a lot of bike rides.
[01:34:52.545 --> 01:34:58.751]  He lives by a creek that constantly floods over, constantly dealing with mosquitoes, constantly needing the bug spray.
[01:34:58.751 --> 01:35:02.855]  But I had a friend that worked in a bug spray manufacturing plant.
[01:35:03.596 --> 01:35:15.041]  And he told me he will never ever again spray bug spray onto his body, because if you saw the toxic chemicals that went into that bug spray, you would avoid it like the plague.
[01:35:15.041 --> 01:35:15.461]  Oh yeah.
[01:35:15.461 --> 01:35:18.762]  So my dad was asking me, he's like, what kind of all-natural bug spray can I get?
[01:35:18.762 --> 01:35:23.564]  And then what do you know, a week later, honestly, just a gift of God, Emmerich Essentials B.O.A.
[01:35:23.564 --> 01:35:25.485]  spray, all-natural bug spray.
[01:35:25.485 --> 01:35:26.365]  Don't spray.
[01:35:26.365 --> 01:35:32.088]  When you go out on vacation, when you go out to the pool, when you go out to the lake, don't spray that toxic bug spray on you, folks.
[01:35:32.088 --> 01:35:32.888]  It is literally
[01:35:33.228 --> 01:35:34.589]  Poison, okay?
[01:35:34.589 --> 01:35:36.470]  Get the Emrix Essentials Bug Spray.
[01:35:36.470 --> 01:35:39.973]  It is all natural and it's not going to poison you.
[01:35:39.973 --> 01:35:47.398]  So, thanks for your support at InfowarsStore.com and check out our new products and the products we have discounted like BioTrue Selenium.
[01:35:47.398 --> 01:35:53.882]  Let's go back to Matt Dubiel and Rachel Lawrence who is on the ground at the People's Summit.
[01:35:53.882 --> 01:35:55.763]  It's the People's Summit!
[01:35:55.763 --> 01:35:59.046]  Hey Rachel, has The Rock made an appearance yet?
[01:35:59.046 --> 01:36:00.467]  I have not seen The Rock.
[01:36:01.138 --> 01:36:02.299]  Darn it!
[01:36:02.299 --> 01:36:02.919]  Just Bernie.
[01:36:02.919 --> 01:36:05.081]  Sorry to disappoint you.
[01:36:05.081 --> 01:36:06.722]  He's on schedule there, though, isn't he?
[01:36:06.722 --> 01:36:11.986]  I have a lot of Bernie shirts, Bernie pins, a lot of shirts that say F Trump.
[01:36:11.986 --> 01:36:14.547]  Okay, yeah, get into more about what you're seeing with the people there.
[01:36:14.547 --> 01:36:18.670]  You kind of talked about the registration process, you talked about the weirdness about applying.
[01:36:18.670 --> 01:36:23.594]  Get into any more weirdness about the registration process, but then what types of people are you actually seeing there?
[01:36:24.788 --> 01:36:29.250]  I have to remind you, it hasn't actually started yet.
[01:36:29.250 --> 01:36:40.296]  So we have some excited folks, and actually to be honest with you, I see a lot of the same type of atmosphere that I've seen at Trump rallies, that I've seen at the Republican National Convention.
[01:36:40.296 --> 01:36:41.757]  Just a lot of people who are excited.
[01:36:42.217 --> 01:36:46.919]  Happy and great mood, smiling at everybody, conversing, making friends.
[01:36:46.919 --> 01:37:02.385]  Aside from the attire, which is obviously a progressive Bernie statement, political statement type of attire, it's been... You know, Rachel, I think that's important because as Matt was talking about, you've got people... Bernie has an anti-establishment
[01:37:02.685 --> 01:37:03.045]  I think so.
[01:37:17.817 --> 01:37:34.887]  All this information came out about how the ruthless establishment Hillary Clinton had rigged that in a very shameless way and so you had all these people who were Bernie supporters and we believe that Seth Rich and others were the ones who actually turned this information over that it was not hacked by the Russians.
[01:37:34.887 --> 01:37:39.810]  CrowdStrike is the only source saying that there was a Russian hack that got that information.
[01:37:39.810 --> 01:37:42.032]  Julian Assange says there was no state actor.
[01:37:42.032 --> 01:37:44.333]  We had a UK ambassador say there was no involvement.
[01:37:44.333 --> 01:37:46.975]  It was people like the people here at this event.
[01:37:47.435 --> 01:37:54.721]  Who were energized by an outsider, who was leftist, but he did, as Matt points out, he does have some overlap.
[01:37:54.721 --> 01:37:59.685]  He opposed the TPP, these transnational agreements that are unfair trade.
[01:37:59.685 --> 01:38:03.929]  So there's some overlap with some of the things that Bernie thought with Trump supporters.
[01:38:03.929 --> 01:38:09.253]  But that was a very important thing for them to do, to move people away, to not see
[01:38:10.294 --> 01:38:27.740]  What Hillary Clinton and the Democrat establishment were doing, but then focus on this phony narrative of the Russians, and they've just continued this on and on, but I think it's very important that we understand these people really are energized, as you point out, energized like the Trump supporters were, because he's an outsider.
[01:38:32.606 --> 01:38:39.733]  I was just going to say, it's one of the things that I like about Rachel and her attitude, and it's the right mindset, like you were just mentioning, David.
[01:38:39.733 --> 01:38:47.661]  She's going there to see what's going on, versus, you know, imagine the Antifa people going to an event and what their motives are.
[01:38:48.121 --> 01:39:13.716]  She's going to this event and what we all need to remember is our brothers and sisters in the United States of America are, we're all in this together, so to see what they're seeing, to see things from their point of view is important, but it's also, let's not be naive to the, you know, event and agenda creators like Sarsour and Van and others to see what they're kind of slipping in there because when you are
[01:39:14.691 --> 01:39:15.112]  We're good.
[01:39:32.109 --> 01:39:43.996]  It's great that she's there with an open mind, it's great that she's doing this, and I think that the people there are probably, just like we'd find everywhere, are great people, well-meaning people.
[01:39:43.996 --> 01:39:45.537]  I'm talking about the attendees, of course.
[01:39:45.537 --> 01:39:47.979]  Yes, and like you pointed out with Occupy,
[01:39:48.539 --> 01:40:05.468]  At the beginning, a lot of these people understood, some of them, understood as we were walking through talking to them, they understood about the Federal Reserve, they understood some of those issues, but then the Soros people came in and made it about capitalism, which they then reinterpret as against free markets, that the government should control the economy.
[01:40:05.468 --> 01:40:08.629]  So as you point out, Matt, they slipped this along.
[01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:09.390]  Your comments, Rachel.
[01:40:11.378 --> 01:40:12.119]  Um, you know what?
[01:40:12.119 --> 01:40:13.620]  I was noticing that myself.
[01:40:13.620 --> 01:40:26.172]  I mean, the people who... Part of the reason why I wanted to come to this is because most of the conversation that's going on between the right and the left these days, and conservative and liberal and progressive, is happening on social media.
[01:40:26.172 --> 01:40:31.637]  And social media, with its relative anonymity, it's so easy to slip into this
[01:40:32.097 --> 01:40:32.737]  We're good to go.
[01:40:48.786 --> 01:40:49.246]  I think so.
[01:41:10.153 --> 01:41:18.317]  It was nice to have a conversation with somebody who's not calling me an ignorant Trump supporter or a racist or a bigot.
[01:41:18.317 --> 01:41:21.699]  That seems to be the norm these days.
[01:41:21.699 --> 01:41:28.523]  I can imagine, Rachel, that that's nice because when I go out to these Trump protests, that's pretty much all I get.
[01:41:28.523 --> 01:41:30.184]  I've been called every name under the sun.
[01:41:30.184 --> 01:41:32.805]  I've been hit with everything from an egg to a water bottle.
[01:41:35.527 --> 01:41:47.214]  I was just going to say, I was at the UIC convention, or not convention, but the Trump rally at UIC in Chicago that was shut down, and that was honestly one of the most traumatizing experiences of my life.
[01:41:47.214 --> 01:41:47.855]  Wow, yes.
[01:41:47.855 --> 01:41:53.058]  You know, and I just got to say though, what you're doing I think is really brilliant and really impactful.
[01:41:53.058 --> 01:41:56.480]  You know, I'm somebody that, I'm easy to get riled up.
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:42:04.685]  Once you call me a racist or a bigot or this, that, or the other thing a couple times, I'm out to make you look like an idiot, and then that's what my videos end up devolving to.
[01:42:05.245 --> 01:42:06.787]  I don't think so.
[01:42:24.198 --> 01:42:26.079]  Rachel, obviously you have your own agenda there.
[01:42:26.079 --> 01:42:31.781]  I think you're doing a great job, but hey, you know, if somebody else wants to take this idea up, you know, that would be just fine.
[01:42:31.781 --> 01:42:33.321]  Why don't you go to this summit?
[01:42:33.321 --> 01:42:35.882]  You know, these people, this is the People's Summit.
[01:42:35.882 --> 01:42:37.503]  You got all the Bernie heads out there, right?
[01:42:37.503 --> 01:42:38.904]  You got all the people that hate Trump.
[01:42:38.904 --> 01:42:44.946]  What if somebody went to this summit, just like you did, just to listen, to learn, to meet other people, to hear the other message, but then also you're...
[01:42:45.566 --> 01:42:50.988]  Handing out a flyer raising awareness like, hey by the way, did you know that the DNC is actually being sued right now?
[01:42:50.988 --> 01:42:59.792]  There's actually 48 states right now that are carrying a lawsuit against the DNC because they believe that the Democrat primaries were actually rigged for Hillary Clinton.
[01:42:59.792 --> 01:43:02.853]  So I just wanted to make you guys aware of that and just raise awareness of that.
[01:43:02.853 --> 01:43:07.095]  And then all of a sudden it's like, oh wait, wow, wait a second, maybe Trump wasn't our enemy.
[01:43:07.095 --> 01:43:09.016]  Maybe it was actually Clinton the whole time.
[01:43:09.016 --> 01:43:10.877]  Oh, and then maybe you get some wheels turning there.
[01:43:12.159 --> 01:43:16.984]  That sounds like more of your wheelhouse, Owen, so I'm going to leave that to you.
[01:43:16.984 --> 01:43:18.866]  Whoa, whoa, I got enough work to do here.
[01:43:18.866 --> 01:43:19.446]  Come on now.
[01:43:19.446 --> 01:43:21.408]  Well, I think what you said is very important, Rachel.
[01:43:21.408 --> 01:43:24.011]  I think we need to transcend the tribalism.
[01:43:24.011 --> 01:43:30.798]  I think tribalism just plays into the, as part of the playbook of George Soros, and so we don't want to try to accentuate that.
[01:43:31.258 --> 01:43:40.823]  And I think it's also important, as you pointed out, to try to get beyond this attitude that social media, as you rightly pointed out, fosters.
[01:43:40.823 --> 01:43:46.086]  And that is that as you are able to do things anonymously, you get more and more vicious in your comments.
[01:43:46.086 --> 01:43:55.931]  And I think it's very easy for them to then turn that around and get people to be very vicious when they come out in public, as you saw when Trump came to the University of Chicago.
[01:43:55.931 --> 01:43:57.732]  Tell us a little bit about that experience.
[01:43:59.701 --> 01:44:05.767]  Well, actually, I had gone with my husband, a friend, and his sister.
[01:44:05.767 --> 01:44:09.690]  Actually, I met a couple of friends there.
[01:44:09.690 --> 01:44:14.535]  One of my friends brought along their 12-year-old daughter, and we waited in line.
[01:44:16.136 --> 01:44:35.584]  As we waited outside, we came early obviously because we wanted to be in front, and there was right across the street from us was immediately, I mean I'm talking three hours beforehand, there were already protesters with signs, waving flags, calling us racist, with bullhorns, and actually I
[01:44:36.764 --> 01:44:57.130]  I got kind of tired of it and I pulled out a piece of paper and a sharpie from my bag and I wrote, not racist with arrows pointing to me and my group and because we were just tired of being called for two hours on end racist and have fun at your Klan meeting type of thing and I just kind of held it up across the street you know
[01:44:58.784 --> 01:45:04.529]  And I was actually in the Chicago Tribune's 2016 Photos of the Year for that photo.
[01:45:04.529 --> 01:45:07.452]  That's the kind of hyper-tribalism that they focus on.
[01:45:07.452 --> 01:45:15.059]  And of course, Matt, she's a great example of somebody who is the antithesis of everything they like to characterize the right as being, isn't she?
[01:45:15.299 --> 01:45:16.320]  She's great.
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:17.401]  She's a star.
[01:45:17.401 --> 01:45:19.784]  And I don't mean that in a sycophantic way.
[01:45:19.784 --> 01:45:22.907]  I mean she's a star locally for her community.
[01:45:22.907 --> 01:45:33.978]  And she's the kind of... Rachel's the kind of person that I wish that... There's nothing more empowering for women to see other women getting involved that are also mothers and wives and things.
[01:45:33.978 --> 01:45:35.019]  And so the fact that she's...
[01:45:35.459 --> 01:45:35.599]  Yes!
[01:45:50.424 --> 01:45:51.004]  All right.
[01:46:20.424 --> 01:46:21.804]  That's a great picture.
[01:46:21.804 --> 01:46:25.446]  But to everybody that's listening and can hear my voice right now,
[01:46:47.473 --> 01:46:53.735]  Chicago is a battleground state for the transition of this country.
[01:46:53.735 --> 01:46:57.536]  And you may not realize it as much as you should.
[01:46:57.536 --> 01:47:12.279]  And from the implant of the mayor here, to the agenda of sanctuary cities here, to the events like this, to the fact that it's a blue city in what's pretty much a red state, this state is very important.
[01:47:12.279 --> 01:47:14.200]  So we need to get more things happening.
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:22.022]  You know how much good they could have done if they would have put that in the right neighborhood or if they would have taken that money and used it for
[01:47:32.666 --> 01:47:38.795]  Well, Obama just got a $70 million book advance and then he's lecturing you about the 1%.
[01:47:38.795 --> 01:47:39.456]  Give me a break.
[01:47:39.456 --> 01:47:46.707]  Again, we're talking to Matt Dubiel from WKG and Rachel Lawrence who's done a great job out in Chicago with activism.
[01:47:47.308 --> 01:47:51.111]  And I was just curious, we've got a little more time left here with Rachel.
[01:47:51.111 --> 01:47:54.673]  What is the order of events for this evening's People's Summit?
[01:47:54.673 --> 01:47:57.435]  When is the Toy Story dinosaur talking?
[01:47:57.435 --> 01:48:00.657]  When is Danny Glover from Angels in the Outfield talking?
[01:48:00.657 --> 01:48:03.038]  When is Bernista Sandernista talking?
[01:48:03.038 --> 01:48:09.823]  And then when is the, by my measurement, Agent of Hamas, that's my opinion, Linda Sarsour talking?
[01:48:10.874 --> 01:48:22.965]  So what I've seen and what was handed out to me, of course, we were also given this People's Summit agenda, which has the calendar, but then there's also the People's Summit app.
[01:48:22.965 --> 01:48:25.508]  According to the agenda that I was given today,
[01:48:27.569 --> 01:48:32.552]  There's going to be workshops throughout the day and then at 7 p.m.
[01:48:32.552 --> 01:48:43.920]  starting tomorrow actually Saturday and Sunday tomorrow and the next day will be the big days tomorrow Bernie Sanders will be speaking looks like 7 p.m.
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:47.182]  Today is mostly workshops starting at 1 o'clock.
[01:48:47.182 --> 01:48:48.763]  What are these workshops?
[01:48:48.763 --> 01:48:49.363]  What are they doing?
[01:48:52.025 --> 01:49:02.674]  For example, we have today is called Political Education Sessions and they include... I'm just going to check my app because it doesn't say it on here.
[01:49:02.674 --> 01:49:08.939]  One of them was specifically refers to the media and using the media.
[01:49:08.939 --> 01:49:10.520]  Weaponizing the media.
[01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:11.941]  There you go.
[01:49:11.941 --> 01:49:13.242]  That's not in their words.
[01:49:13.242 --> 01:49:14.884]  The media is your friend.
[01:49:16.036 --> 01:49:21.079]  So according to the agenda today, they call them breakouts.
[01:49:21.079 --> 01:49:23.100]  They're actually workshops.
[01:49:23.100 --> 01:49:23.800]  Oh my gosh.
[01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:24.181]  I'm sorry.
[01:49:24.181 --> 01:49:25.501]  I have to stop Rachel for a second.
[01:49:25.501 --> 01:49:27.682]  Guys, will you please go back to the top of this?
[01:49:27.682 --> 01:49:28.523]  Look at this.
[01:49:28.523 --> 01:49:29.223]  I'm sorry.
[01:49:29.223 --> 01:49:30.304]  I'm losing it now.
[01:49:30.304 --> 01:49:31.625]  The attack on democracy.
[01:49:31.625 --> 01:49:32.045]  Look at this.
[01:49:32.045 --> 01:49:33.726]  These are the first workshops.
[01:49:33.726 --> 01:49:36.527]  The attack on democracy.
[01:49:36.527 --> 01:49:38.268]  Folks, this is what I'm talking about.
[01:49:38.268 --> 01:49:41.130]  The DNC is being sued!
[01:49:41.710 --> 01:49:45.553]  The DNC is literally being sued because they messed with the election!
[01:49:45.553 --> 01:49:47.274]  I'm sorry, this is... I'm sorry, go ahead, Rachel.
[01:49:47.274 --> 01:49:48.315]  This is just ridiculous.
[01:49:48.315 --> 01:49:53.839]  Yeah, so there's some interesting workshop titles.
[01:49:53.839 --> 01:50:02.626]  I know that one of them that sparked my interest for tomorrow was entitled, Media, Our Movement, and the Political Revolution.
[01:50:02.626 --> 01:50:04.788]  So that one I'm kind of interested in.
[01:50:04.788 --> 01:50:06.029]  I may attend that one.
[01:50:06.909 --> 01:50:20.116]  That one says that the speakers are Sarah Jaffe, or J-A-F-F-E, Nomiki Comst, and Sarah Leonard from Venetian, as well as Winnie Wong, co-founder of the people for Bernie.
[01:50:21.237 --> 01:50:21.497]  Unbelievable.
[01:50:21.497 --> 01:50:29.079]  So what they're trying to do is they're trying to use our tactic, which is that we take their little catchphrases and their little things and we steal them and then use them to our advantage.
[01:50:29.079 --> 01:50:30.960]  That's what they're trying to do with the resistance.
[01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:32.940]  That's what they're trying to do with the political revolution.
[01:50:32.940 --> 01:50:34.981]  We had our political revolution with Trump.
[01:50:34.981 --> 01:50:38.382]  Thank you, Matt Dubiel from WKCG.com.
[01:50:38.382 --> 01:50:39.862]  Thank you for everything you do for InfoWars.
[01:50:39.862 --> 01:50:47.004]  And thank you, Rachel Lawrence, for everything you do for grassroots conservatism in Chicago and for the reporting you're going to be doing from the People's Summit.

[01:50:48.605 --> 01:50:49.885]  Owen Shroyer, David Knight, with you.
[01:51:00.037 --> 01:51:04.839]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[01:51:04.839 --> 01:51:10.702]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.

[01:51:59.412 --> 01:52:09.957]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:52:09.957 --> 01:52:11.998]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:52:11.998 --> 01:52:14.860]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:52:14.860 --> 01:52:16.341]  It's made in the USA.
[01:52:16.341 --> 01:52:23.144]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:52:23.144 --> 01:52:24.405]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[01:52:25.185 --> 01:52:34.847]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:52:34.847 --> 01:52:51.571]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:52:51.571 --> 01:52:54.712]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[01:52:54.872 --> 01:52:58.152]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and 4WarsLive.com.
[01:52:59.272 --> 01:53:03.293]  Nearly one third of FBI domestic terrorism cases involve refugees.
[01:53:03.293 --> 01:53:04.353]  One third.
[01:53:04.353 --> 01:53:06.373]  There's already been riots across Europe.
[01:53:06.373 --> 01:53:07.594]  Is America next?
[01:53:07.594 --> 01:53:09.854]  Hi, I'm the owner of Infidel Body Armor.
[01:53:09.854 --> 01:53:15.055]  Over the past four years, I've sold thousands of body armor kits and trained hundreds of sheepdogs.

[01:53:22.077 --> 01:53:23.237]  Trouble is coming.

[01:53:28.737 --> 01:53:29.637]  It's a no-brainer.

[01:54:34.245 --> 01:54:35.286]  4.8 star reviews.
[01:54:35.286 --> 01:54:38.348]  That's nearly perfect reviews for this product.

[01:54:51.405 --> 01:54:59.333]  Emrix Essentials, Nano SPF 30 Zinc Oxide Sunscreen, DEET Free Herbal Bug Spray.
[01:54:59.333 --> 01:55:00.854]  That's what I was talking about, folks.
[01:55:00.854 --> 01:55:10.963]  Look, the crap that they put in bug spray is literally toxic, it is literally poison, and then they somehow manufacture it, put it in a can, and then say it's good to put on your skin.
[01:55:11.744 --> 01:55:13.785]  You know why the bugs don't eat it?
[01:55:13.785 --> 01:55:15.545]  Because it's poison!
[01:55:15.545 --> 01:55:22.728]  So, congrats for the bugs for not eating their own death warrant, which is the bug spray they put out, which will be your death warrant, too.
[01:55:22.728 --> 01:55:26.389]  But we offer an alternative be-away spray.
[01:55:26.389 --> 01:55:28.250]  Folks, check out Emmerich Essentials.
[01:55:28.250 --> 01:55:29.630]  The shampoo is amazing, too.
[01:55:29.630 --> 01:55:33.391]  And don't forget about the Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste.
[01:55:33.391 --> 01:55:34.012]  That's all we do.
[01:55:34.012 --> 01:55:41.014]  We take products that are laden with poisons and things that are not good for you, toxic for your body, toxic for our environment.
[01:55:41.454 --> 01:55:48.678]  And we put out a product that is good for you, not toxic, not laden with poison, that we like to use ourselves.
[01:55:48.678 --> 01:55:49.458]  So check that out.
[01:55:49.458 --> 01:55:52.040]  Another product with a 4.8 review.
[01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:52.760]  Shocking.
[01:55:52.760 --> 01:55:54.781]  Currently on sale as well.
[01:55:56.638 --> 01:56:01.801]  You know, here's the thing about the nothing burger that was the James Comey hearing yesterday.
[01:56:01.801 --> 01:56:03.663]  It would have been a nothing burger.
[01:56:03.663 --> 01:56:06.425]  Yes, it would have been a complete nothing burger.
[01:56:06.425 --> 01:56:10.187]  But then James Comey decided to offer himself as the beef.
[01:56:10.187 --> 01:56:13.489]  So what went from a nothing burger became a James Comey burger.
[01:56:13.489 --> 01:56:21.495]  The two big things to me was Comey admitting he was the linker, Comey admitting that he relies on third-party intelligence to decide Russia hacked the DNC.
[01:56:21.495 --> 01:56:26.158]  But it's amazing because if you look at the date, and I think Comey is going to have to end up answering this question, David,
[01:56:26.858 --> 01:56:37.233]  If you look at the date when the alleged leak, when Comey gave it to a friend to give to the media after Trump's tape tweet, that's the key.
[01:56:37.233 --> 01:56:41.438]  The story that the New York Times printed was on May 11th.
[01:56:41.438 --> 01:56:43.301]  Trump's tape tweet was on May 12th.
[01:56:44.833 --> 01:56:48.117]  So, what is Comey talking about then?
[01:56:48.117 --> 01:56:49.118]  What leak?
[01:56:49.118 --> 01:56:50.519]  What memo?
[01:56:50.519 --> 01:56:54.624]  Because that timing doesn't actually work out.
[01:56:54.624 --> 01:56:55.525]  So he's going to have to answer that.
[01:56:55.525 --> 01:56:58.968]  He said that in response to Trump saying... He said that very specifically.
[01:56:58.968 --> 01:56:59.849]  So that's not clear.
[01:56:59.849 --> 01:57:06.376]  And yet we have this article from NBC News saying, there's no indication that the former FBI director lied under oath during his testimony.
[01:57:07.177 --> 01:57:08.239]  Seriously NBC?
[01:57:08.239 --> 01:57:15.730]  We have him saying different contradictory 180 degrees away from and two sworn testimonies.
[01:57:15.730 --> 01:57:20.397]  One of them saying that nobody ever pressured him for political purposes to stop an investigation.
[01:57:20.397 --> 01:57:21.339]  That would be a big deal.
[01:57:21.339 --> 01:57:22.540]  That never happened.
[01:57:23.257 --> 01:57:26.841]  And then he comes out and says yesterday that it did, and then the other lie that you had there.
[01:57:26.841 --> 01:57:39.456]  And then of course we have the leak that he admitted to, and we have President Trump's outside counsel, Mark Kazowitz, is going to file a complaint with the Department of Justice Inspector General and with the Senate Judiciary Committee.
[01:57:40.337 --> 01:57:50.605]  And they're saying that in a statement after Comey's testimony Thursday afternoon, Kazowitz labeled Comey as one of those leakers who are actively attempting to undermine the president.
[01:57:50.605 --> 01:57:55.008]  In other words, this would justify his firing alone.
[01:57:55.008 --> 01:57:56.730]  The fact that he is a leaker.
[01:57:56.730 --> 01:58:01.453]  He did so many things and of course the investigation was irrelevant to this.
[01:58:01.453 --> 01:58:02.874]  Trump was not being investigated.
[01:58:02.874 --> 01:58:03.375]  We learned that.
[01:58:03.955 --> 01:58:13.841]  Trump subsequently did a special investigator so the investigation goes on without Mr. Comey and hopefully they can arrive at a conclusion.
[01:58:13.841 --> 01:58:25.508]  One of the things they did during this and we haven't really talked about this but all these Democrat senators are coming up and saying but what about this Russian bank or what about this throwing out these little breadcrumbs that they know that Comey's gonna have to say well I can't talk about that.
[01:58:25.748 --> 01:58:27.950]  But we're going to talk about that when we come back.
[01:58:27.950 --> 01:58:28.371]  Stay with us.
[01:58:28.371 --> 01:58:32.715]  We're going to play you some of the top 10 hits from the Comey hearing.
[01:58:32.715 --> 01:58:35.538]  And then we have Mark Dice coming up in the next hour.
[01:58:35.538 --> 01:58:36.039]  Stay with us.
[01:58:36.039 --> 01:58:41.264]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:41.264 --> 01:58:44.808]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:44.808 --> 01:58:46.890]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.444 --> 01:58:54.685]  Some important revelations came out during James Comey's testimony.
[01:58:54.685 --> 01:59:05.449]  Democrats hoping to have Trump impeached for obstruction of justice were greatly let down when Comey's testimony revealed that President Trump was innocent of those false allegations.
[01:59:05.449 --> 01:59:17.993]  One revelation was that President Trump was not under investigation by the FBI, dispelling rumors perpetuated by the mainstream media that Trump fired Comey as retaliation for investigating him.
[01:59:17.993 --> 01:59:20.094]  Another was that Comey admitted leaking his
[01:59:20.094 --> 01:59:21.034]  This is Millie Weaver.
[01:59:52.677 --> 01:59:55.282]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:21.564 --> 02:00:29.665]  In the last segment, David Knight pointed out how they keep trying to put these little bread crumbs to try to lead you to fake news about Trump-Russia collusion.
[02:00:29.665 --> 02:00:37.707]  Meanwhile, there's entire loaves of bread, the entire loaf, that leads you to Clintons and the Russians for collusion, but we ignore that.
[02:00:37.707 --> 02:00:39.627]  And the other irony of this whole thing is that
[02:00:40.427 --> 02:00:43.228]  No matter what, Trump never even acted illegally.
[02:00:43.228 --> 02:00:46.828]  Even if he did what it's being alleged that he did, it still wouldn't be illegal.
[02:00:46.828 --> 02:00:48.469]  He's the President of the United States.
[02:00:48.469 --> 02:00:52.550]  But here are the top 10 moments from the Jim Comey hearing.
[02:00:52.550 --> 02:01:01.712]  Do you show copies of your memos to anyone outside of the Department of Justice?
[02:01:01.712 --> 02:01:01.872]  Yes.
[02:01:03.405 --> 02:01:06.106]  And to whom did you show copies?
[02:01:06.106 --> 02:01:09.347]  And my judgment was I needed to get that out into the public square.
[02:01:09.347 --> 02:01:14.228]  And so I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter.
[02:01:14.228 --> 02:01:20.290]  Didn't do it myself for a variety of reasons, but I asked him to because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel.
[02:01:20.290 --> 02:01:23.010]  Which it did, and it cost him his job.
[02:01:23.010 --> 02:01:27.692]  You told the president, I would see what we could do.
[02:01:27.692 --> 02:01:28.352]  What did you mean?
[02:01:30.114 --> 02:01:33.777]  I was kind of a slightly cowardly way of trying to avoid telling you.
[02:01:33.777 --> 02:01:35.019]  Oh, a self-admitted coward.
[02:01:35.019 --> 02:01:37.281]  That I would see what we could do.
[02:01:37.281 --> 02:01:41.004]  It was a way of kind of getting off the phone, frankly.
[02:01:41.004 --> 02:01:45.849]  And then I turned and handed it to the acting Deputy Attorney General, Mr. Bente.
[02:01:45.849 --> 02:01:47.590]  That was pretty cowardly.
[02:01:47.590 --> 02:01:50.773]  Yes, I'm a coward.
[02:01:50.773 --> 02:01:52.655]  I love this.
[02:01:52.655 --> 02:01:54.697]  Basically, Loretta Lynch is my boss.
[02:01:55.677 --> 02:02:02.920]  Was your decision influenced by the Attorney General's tarmac meeting with the former President Bill Clinton?
[02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:06.542]  Yes, in an ultimately conclusive way.
[02:02:06.542 --> 02:02:10.384]  That was the thing that kept it from me, that I had to do something separately.
[02:02:10.384 --> 02:02:20.209]  Probably the only other consideration, but I guess I can talk about it in an open setting, is that at one point the Attorney General had directed me not to call it an investigation, instead to call it a matter.
[02:02:21.092 --> 02:02:23.454]  Call it a matter, not an investigation.
[02:02:23.454 --> 02:02:27.498]  Can you believe Lil Marco Rubio ends up being the biggest guy at this deal?
[02:02:27.498 --> 02:02:28.819]  Gotta give him credit.
[02:02:28.819 --> 02:02:29.840]  Yes sir, that's how it is.
[02:02:42.532 --> 02:02:42.792]  Correct.
[02:02:42.792 --> 02:02:43.413]  Yes, sir.
[02:02:43.413 --> 02:02:43.934]  Okay.
[02:02:43.934 --> 02:02:55.567]  And just to be clear, for you to make a public statement that he was not under investigation would not have been illegal, but you felt it made no sense because it could potentially create a duty to correct if circumstances changed.
[02:02:55.567 --> 02:02:55.867]  Yes, sir.
[02:02:55.867 --> 02:03:01.333]  We wrestled with it before my testimony was confirmed that there was an investigation.
[02:03:01.333 --> 02:03:03.676]  Going back, the three requests were, number one,
[02:03:05.168 --> 02:03:06.249]  Be loyal.
[02:03:06.249 --> 02:03:08.370]  To me, not the Clintons.
[02:03:08.370 --> 02:03:09.751]  Let the Mike Flynn thing go.
[02:03:09.751 --> 02:03:10.352]  He's a good guy.
[02:03:10.352 --> 02:03:11.432]  He's been treated unfairly.
[02:03:11.432 --> 02:03:21.899]  And number three, can you please tell the American people what these leaders in Congress already know, what you already know, what you've told me three times, that I'm not personally under investigation.
[02:03:21.899 --> 02:03:23.160]  Those are the three things he asked.
[02:03:23.160 --> 02:03:24.101]  Yes, sir.
[02:03:24.101 --> 02:03:26.422]  This investigation is full of leaks left and right.
[02:03:26.422 --> 02:03:30.305]  I mean, we've learned more from the newspapers sometimes than we do from our open hearings, for sure.
[02:03:30.305 --> 02:03:31.246]  Comey even admits that.
[02:03:32.110 --> 02:03:45.116]  You ever wonder why, of all the things in this investigation, the only thing that's never been leaked is the fact that the president was not personally under investigation, despite the fact that both Democrats and Republicans and the leadership of Congress knew that and have known that for weeks?
[02:03:45.116 --> 02:03:47.477]  Hold it right there, hold it right there, hold it right there.
[02:03:47.477 --> 02:03:48.377]  And that's the key thing.
[02:03:48.377 --> 02:03:49.998]  We're talking about lifting the cloud.
[02:03:50.819 --> 02:03:52.060]  Rubio hit the nail on the head.
[02:03:52.060 --> 02:03:54.541]  He says, why is it that everybody here knows this?
[02:03:54.541 --> 02:03:55.461]  It's an open secret.
[02:03:55.461 --> 02:03:56.322]  The president knew it.
[02:03:56.322 --> 02:04:00.584]  And we even had the New York Times and CNN coming back and saying, no, no, no, he was under investigation.
[02:04:00.584 --> 02:04:01.444]  No, he wasn't.
[02:04:01.444 --> 02:04:02.845]  We heard that multiple times yesterday.
[02:04:02.845 --> 02:04:06.466]  And he said, why is it that the one thing that wasn't leaked out?
[02:04:06.466 --> 02:04:07.607]  We've had so many leaks.
[02:04:07.607 --> 02:04:15.671]  The one thing that wasn't leaked out would be the thing that would lift the cloud, that would allow them to go ahead with the business of the people that they were elected to pursue.
[02:04:15.671 --> 02:04:17.311]  No, it was strictly obstruction.
[02:04:17.311 --> 02:04:18.512]  I think the key thing here, Owen,
[02:04:18.972 --> 02:04:28.640]  Because I think Marco Rubio, no friend of Donald Trump, they had some pretty harsh words with each other and this is not taking one for the party or whatever.
[02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:35.385]  He understands, as does Rand Paul and Senator Grassley and these other people, he understands the deep corruption.
[02:04:35.985 --> 02:04:38.146]  But he should have addressed that question to the media.
[02:04:38.146 --> 02:04:40.188]  That's who needs to answer that question.
[02:04:40.188 --> 02:04:44.090]  Why didn't the media ever report that Trump wasn't being investigated?
[02:04:44.090 --> 02:04:46.131]  We'll be right back with Mark Dice on the other side.
[02:05:00.393 --> 02:05:04.636]  Some important revelations came out during James Comey's testimony.
[02:05:04.636 --> 02:05:15.383]  Democrats hoping to have Trump impeached for obstruction of justice were greatly let down when Comey's testimony revealed that President Trump was innocent of those false allegations.
[02:05:15.383 --> 02:05:24.969]  One revelation was that President Trump was not under investigation by the FBI, dispelling rumors perpetuated by the mainstream media that Trump fired Comey as
[02:05:25.069 --> 02:05:26.330]  We're good to go.

[02:07:07.154 --> 02:07:08.295]  My family takes this.

[02:07:21.802 --> 02:07:22.943]  I don't feel good.
[02:07:22.943 --> 02:07:26.705]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[02:07:26.705 --> 02:07:29.387]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my Super Female.
[02:07:29.387 --> 02:07:35.191]  I had a few bottles at my house, and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[02:07:35.191 --> 02:07:38.153]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[02:07:38.153 --> 02:07:41.695]  And I know my hair's a little luxurious once again.
[02:07:41.695 --> 02:07:43.917]  So, obviously, the Super Female is amazing.
[02:07:43.917 --> 02:07:44.277]  I love it.
[02:07:44.437 --> 02:07:47.242]  Nascent Iodine is essential.
[02:07:47.242 --> 02:07:48.264]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:07:48.264 --> 02:07:54.073]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest, it's Nascent Iodine Survival Shield X2.
[02:07:54.073 --> 02:07:56.097]  It's got a five-star rating.
[02:07:56.097 --> 02:07:58.281]  It's a win-win in fullwarslife.com.
[02:08:09.166 --> 02:08:14.669]  Another time, in the age of wonder.
[02:08:14.669 --> 02:08:18.170]  Another world, another time.
[02:08:18.170 --> 02:08:23.693]  His life was green and good, until the Christmas crack.
[02:08:27.551 --> 02:08:32.158]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:32.158 --> 02:08:38.287]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:39.719 --> 02:08:41.279]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:41.279 --> 02:08:43.160]  Owen Shroyer, David Knight with you.
[02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:50.282]  Mike Cernovich will pick it up in the fourth hour, and he will most likely be covering what will be Trump's press conference.
[02:08:50.282 --> 02:08:54.583]  Obviously, I think the main topic of discussion will be James Comey's hearing yesterday.
[02:08:54.583 --> 02:08:57.964]  I think that that's why this press conference is being held.
[02:08:57.964 --> 02:08:58.524]  Should be interesting.
[02:08:58.824 --> 02:09:00.244]  Interesting.
[02:09:00.244 --> 02:09:11.026]  It's supposed to start in about 35 minutes, but usually Trump's a little behind, so I'm expecting that won't start until about 2 o'clock Central, and Mike Cernovich will most likely be covering that, but me and David might still be along for the ride.
[02:09:11.026 --> 02:09:13.287]  Joining us now is Mark Dice.
[02:09:13.287 --> 02:09:15.187]  I'm sure you know all about him by now.
[02:09:15.187 --> 02:09:18.388]  Just reached over a million subscribers on YouTube.
[02:09:18.388 --> 02:09:19.668]  New videos every day.
[02:09:19.668 --> 02:09:20.808]  He's also an author.
[02:09:20.808 --> 02:09:24.509]  His latest book is The Bilderberg Group, Facts and Fiction.
[02:09:25.728 --> 02:09:50.345]  You know, Mark, it's probably getting tougher for you to go out on the street nowadays with your newfound fame here, and with all of this Trump-Russia collusion, Russia hacked this, they want to build this up, well, you took to the streets to decide what people would think about the notion of nuking Russia because of this fake news, and you found that liberals, who are for peace, mind you, actually want to nuke Russia.
[02:09:51.274 --> 02:09:53.717]  Now this is actually a clip that's two years old.
[02:09:53.717 --> 02:09:57.341]  I haven't been doing Weekly Man on the Streets for probably the last few months.
[02:09:57.341 --> 02:09:58.402]  I've just been a little bit too busy.
[02:09:58.402 --> 02:10:00.685]  I'm working on a new book, trying to get that done.
[02:10:00.685 --> 02:10:10.115]  But I think this video has new life because it just goes to show that two years ago, the liberals would do anything that we said Obama wanted them to do.
[02:10:10.115 --> 02:10:11.256]  And so now that there's this
[02:10:11.997 --> 02:10:15.880]  Complete fervor and fear about Russia.
[02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:22.344]  I think the video has new life and maybe I should redo it because it's reached a level of insanity.
[02:10:22.344 --> 02:10:27.708]  It's hard to tell what is actually news from the supposed news networks.
[02:10:27.708 --> 02:10:32.111]  Maybe you could go out with a different angle and go out this time and say, hey, we just nuked Russia.
[02:10:32.111 --> 02:10:39.015]  Just tell them that we just nuked Russia because Kathy Griffin said it was a good idea and then see how they respond to that.
[02:10:39.015 --> 02:10:40.056]  Maybe that could be the new one.
[02:10:40.526 --> 02:10:41.407]  They would like it.
[02:10:41.407 --> 02:10:42.909]  They would celebrate it.
[02:10:42.909 --> 02:10:44.151]  It's just incredible.
[02:10:44.151 --> 02:10:47.676]  I don't know how much longer they can cling on to this conspiracy theory about Russia.
[02:10:47.676 --> 02:10:49.778]  I mean, they might drag it on another few months.
[02:10:49.778 --> 02:10:55.306]  It's been seven months now since the election, and every day it's still the number one topic.
[02:10:55.546 --> 02:11:09.108]  I mean, James Comey's hearing yesterday really was one of the bigger backfires in the establishment's face because he admitted that he, President Trump, quote, just hoped that he could drop the investigation.
[02:11:09.108 --> 02:11:23.611]  And you probably, maybe you played the clip earlier in the show, there was a senator who confronted him about that and asked him if there's ever been an instance of anybody being charged with obstruction of justice or any crime for hoping for something.
[02:11:24.031 --> 02:11:27.335]  Because you can hope horrible things onto someone.
[02:11:27.335 --> 02:11:28.236]  That's not a threat.
[02:11:28.236 --> 02:11:29.337]  That's not a direction.
[02:11:29.337 --> 02:11:38.567]  Well, and it's my understanding that even, even if, even if Donald Trump would have come up to Comey and said, you know what?
[02:11:38.567 --> 02:11:39.428]  There's nothing here.
[02:11:39.428 --> 02:11:40.970]  This is a waste of time and money.
[02:11:40.970 --> 02:11:42.852]  Drop this investigation.
[02:11:42.852 --> 02:11:43.913]  Even that would have been legal.
[02:11:44.901 --> 02:11:52.282]  So, this whole thing is manifesting over fake news, over fake allegations, over stuff that's not even illegal.
[02:11:52.282 --> 02:11:55.883]  It just, it keeps getting worse and worse.
[02:11:55.883 --> 02:12:01.004]  It was hilarious when Comey said, well, he didn't say that with his words.
[02:12:01.004 --> 02:12:02.544]  Not with his words.
[02:12:02.544 --> 02:12:03.364]  What was he doing?
[02:12:03.364 --> 02:12:04.824]  Spelling it out in carets?
[02:12:04.824 --> 02:12:06.645]  He was doing interpretive dance.
[02:12:06.645 --> 02:12:07.805]  He was doing the Donald Trump.
[02:12:07.805 --> 02:12:09.385]  This is actually interpretive dancing.
[02:12:09.385 --> 02:12:10.405]  And he does.
[02:12:10.405 --> 02:12:13.386]  This isn't the investigation you're looking for, Mr. Comey.
[02:12:14.366 --> 02:12:14.927]  It's just insane.
[02:12:14.927 --> 02:12:20.370]  Even Chris Matthews has admitted that the whole Russia collusion conspiracy theory has come apart.
[02:12:20.370 --> 02:12:30.556]  So now they're clinging on to this hope that they can somehow get him on obstruction because he hoped that nothing would come of the investigation.
[02:12:30.556 --> 02:12:33.217]  It's just absolutely ridiculous and a lot of legal experts are saying
[02:12:34.278 --> 02:12:34.398]  Yeah.
[02:12:52.186 --> 02:12:58.531]  Did he run out to his car and draft a memo and leak that out to the press?
[02:12:58.531 --> 02:12:59.352]  No.
[02:12:59.352 --> 02:13:09.139]  It's just astounding to see that his whole reason for this hearing and leaking the memo was to try to get President Trump indicted and impeached.
[02:13:09.139 --> 02:13:12.041]  He is one of the deep state leakers.
[02:13:12.041 --> 02:13:17.906]  And we know that the other deep state leaker that's been busted isn't an Edward Snowden or a Daniel Ellsberg.
[02:13:18.889 --> 02:13:22.052]  She is a Taliban-supporting traitor.
[02:13:22.052 --> 02:13:23.333]  There's no comparison.
[02:13:23.333 --> 02:13:26.816]  Edward Snowden was a patriot who was an actual whistleblower.
[02:13:26.816 --> 02:13:27.677]  This woman's a leaker.
[02:13:27.677 --> 02:13:29.599]  Whistleblowers release information.
[02:13:33.983 --> 02:13:38.264]  She released what amounted to common sense.
[02:13:38.264 --> 02:13:46.447]  David, real quick, I want to get your take on this, but let's recall here, the fake news told us for weeks that James Comey was an aggressive memo taker.
[02:13:46.447 --> 02:13:47.067]  Remember?
[02:13:47.067 --> 02:13:48.168]  He's always taking memos.
[02:13:48.168 --> 02:13:49.068]  Aggressive memo taker.
[02:13:49.548 --> 02:13:53.291]  Then Comey says, well I never took any memos until I met with Trump.
[02:13:53.291 --> 02:13:54.813]  So this proves two things.
[02:13:54.813 --> 02:13:58.616]  The news is fake and lied about Comey being an aggressive memo taker.
[02:13:58.616 --> 02:14:06.423]  And two, James Comey is an incompetent boob who never took notes when having some of the most important intelligence meetings that you could ever have.
[02:14:07.250 --> 02:14:15.534]  And it's so hilarious because we saw CNN got busted with their fake news the day before, hours really, before Comey released his pre-planned opening statement.
[02:14:15.534 --> 02:14:21.538]  They had said that he was going to contradict the claims, that he had said that President Trump was not under investigation.
[02:14:21.538 --> 02:14:24.679]  Then a few hours later, that backfired in CNN's face.
[02:14:24.679 --> 02:14:33.064]  And then after he admitted, after being, you know, properly questioned by one of the senators, that the New York Times article was fake about the collusion between Russia
[02:14:33.664 --> 02:14:34.505]  We're good to go.
[02:14:51.281 --> 02:15:07.966]  I was like the troll Jake Tapper and so a New York Times former investigative reporter for the New York Times like replied to one of my tweets and it said oh so says the guy who is quote best known for conspiracy theories about secret societies according to Wikipedia.
[02:15:08.546 --> 02:15:09.387]  That's literally what he said.
[02:15:09.387 --> 02:15:18.454]  We have a former New York Times investigative journalist sourcing Wikipedia for his allegation that I'm best known as a conspiracy theorist.
[02:15:18.454 --> 02:15:20.776]  That's why we call these clowns fake news.
[02:15:20.776 --> 02:15:22.498]  They write the stories for themselves.
[02:15:22.498 --> 02:15:25.960]  They're just providing us with so much more material on a daily basis.
[02:15:25.960 --> 02:15:27.622]  They just keep digging their graves.
[02:15:27.622 --> 02:15:28.983]  We just need to keep handing them more rope.
[02:15:30.322 --> 02:15:40.355]  You know, when we look at what the mainstream media is putting out here, one of the things that they said, Mark, NBC said, there's no indication that the former FBI director lied under oath during his testimony.
[02:15:40.355 --> 02:15:43.059]  Well, maybe they ought to look at the two different testimonies that he gave.
[02:15:43.059 --> 02:15:44.401]  I mean, this guy has
[02:15:45.282 --> 02:15:51.784]  He's implicated himself not only in obstruction of justice for the Clintons, but he's implicated himself with perjury.
[02:15:51.784 --> 02:16:02.627]  And I think it's interesting as we look at this, one of the things we said they're trying to do to Trump besides tie him up, they're trying to create process crimes and trapping people with things.
[02:16:02.627 --> 02:16:09.388]  Because as we saw with Bill Clinton, he wasn't impeached because he raped or sexually assaulted women.
[02:16:09.388 --> 02:16:12.809]  He was impeached because he lied about a consensual affair, which is not a crime.
[02:16:12.809 --> 02:16:14.490]  And here we have James Comey.
[02:16:15.450 --> 02:16:20.557]  Working on his own personal computer just as he was investigating Hillary Clinton for doing that.
[02:16:20.557 --> 02:16:22.520]  I guess he believes that he can get away with it.
[02:16:22.520 --> 02:16:29.189]  That was one of the things also that came out of this was the fact that the mainstream press was saying, look, here's some of the winners.
[02:16:29.189 --> 02:16:30.791]  They said the winner is bipartisanship.
[02:16:31.332 --> 02:16:42.297]  Because we've got both of the Democrats and the Republicans covering for the crimes of the surveillance state that even now the FISA court has blown the whistle on.
[02:16:42.297 --> 02:16:43.237]  That's the real issue.
[02:16:43.237 --> 02:16:47.639]  As you pointed out, Reality Winner was not blowing the whistle on illegal government activity.
[02:16:47.639 --> 02:16:52.241]  She was using her access and stealing documents so that she could do this politically.
[02:16:52.241 --> 02:16:55.483]  And quite frankly, that's really what's behind this Russia narrative.
[02:16:55.743 --> 02:17:06.633]  The idea that Obama, the Obama administration, and Senator Grassley has called him on it, Senator Paul has called him on it, they were using the intelligence community as their own Watergate burglars.
[02:17:06.633 --> 02:17:07.834]  And they're going to get called on that.
[02:17:07.834 --> 02:17:09.175]  That's what they're really concerned about.
[02:17:09.175 --> 02:17:12.318]  That's why they keep this Russian narrative going.
[02:17:12.318 --> 02:17:18.183]  They're trying to conflate the fact that, well, let's just say that Russia did hack into the DNC and John Podesta.
[02:17:20.204 --> 02:17:33.856]  They're trying to conflate that and convince people that somehow they were influencing the voter turnout or the voter rolls and the vote counts and so even shortly before the election Obama was was saying that these were just conspiracy theories.
[02:17:37.806 --> 02:17:41.107]  That's just a conspiracy theory.
[02:17:41.107 --> 02:17:44.328]  Voter fraud, he said, is fake news.
[02:17:44.328 --> 02:17:54.250]  And so now they can't let go for seven months, conflating this, which is a legitimate concern that somebody could hack into the voting machines, which we've been raising.
[02:17:54.250 --> 02:18:03.772]  You guys have been talking about, Alex has been talking about for probably 15 years and was called a conspiracy theorist just for pointing out the possible vulnerabilities in these systems.
[02:18:04.412 --> 02:18:22.599]  And if President Trump, then candidate Trump, was colluding with the Russians, or if one of his team members were colluding with the Russians, why would he be raising the concern about hacking into the voting machines and committing voter fraud if he himself and his team were committing voter fraud?
[02:18:22.799 --> 02:18:24.081]  You wouldn't want to bring that up.
[02:18:24.081 --> 02:18:25.702]  You wouldn't want people to be looking at that.
[02:18:25.702 --> 02:18:30.908]  Well, you know, Mark, you know who really was hacking into the voting machines and trying to hack into our electoral system?
[02:18:30.908 --> 02:18:33.371]  And that was Department of Homeland Security.
[02:18:33.371 --> 02:18:38.918]  And after that was revealed, right after the election, it was revealed that they did that in Georgia.
[02:18:39.498 --> 02:18:54.514]  And then we had a couple of congressmen try to get some information and they said, well, we're not happy because you haven't replied to us, just as Comey did not reply to Senator Grassley when he asked about Comey and the FBI's connections to Christopher Steele, the guy who had created the dirty dossier.
[02:18:54.514 --> 02:18:58.619]  So Jason Chaffetz and Jody Heiss, a couple of Republican congressmen,
[02:18:59.039 --> 02:18:59.359]  I think?
[02:19:19.574 --> 02:19:35.042]  After that was starting to come to a head in Congress, this Reality Winter was hired by a contractor, and then somehow she gets access to a top secret document, which would tell people that, yes, the Russians really are trying to get in here, so now we really do need to have Homeland Security.
[02:19:35.042 --> 02:19:36.223]  It's interesting how that works out.
[02:19:36.403 --> 02:19:40.969]  And at the same time, Michael Moore releases his Trumpy Leaks website.
[02:19:40.969 --> 02:19:46.115]  All in one perfect circle for the left to entrap themselves.
[02:19:46.115 --> 02:19:52.042]  We'll have more of that on the other side, as well as Donald Trump's press conference responding to the James Comey hearing.
[02:19:52.042 --> 02:19:53.023]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:19:53.023 --> 02:19:54.145]  Alex Jones Show.
[02:19:54.145 --> 02:19:55.707]  We are live till 3 o'clock central.
[02:20:02.006 --> 02:20:03.568]  I love sporting events.
[02:20:03.568 --> 02:20:05.229]  The atmosphere, the crowd.
[02:20:05.229 --> 02:20:07.031]  I even enjoy waiting in line.
[02:20:07.031 --> 02:20:13.918]  Because while I'm standing next to you, the RFID scanner in my pocket is capturing your personal information.
[02:20:13.918 --> 02:20:17.741]  From debit and credit cards, even your apartment building key.
[02:20:17.741 --> 02:20:21.605]  So you'll still be paying for this game long after it's over.
[02:20:22.998 --> 02:20:25.719]  Every two seconds, someone is a victim of identity fraud.
[02:20:25.719 --> 02:20:31.141]  This Father's Day, protect Dad from crimes he can't see with ID Stronghold wallets in all Dad's favorite styles.

[02:20:34.463 --> 02:20:38.184]  ID Stronghold pioneered RFID blocking technology over 10 years ago.

[02:20:59.318 --> 02:21:00.139]  Embrics Essentials.
[02:21:00.139 --> 02:21:01.260]  That's my middle name.
[02:21:01.260 --> 02:21:13.649]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic and high quality.
[02:21:13.649 --> 02:21:19.394]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out
[02:21:19.574 --> 02:21:22.737]  High quality organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[02:21:22.737 --> 02:21:27.381]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[02:21:27.381 --> 02:21:34.487]  It is an answer to prayers, and because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail, sign up for auto-ship, an additional 25% off.
[02:21:34.487 --> 02:21:35.608]  It's all there.
[02:21:35.608 --> 02:21:39.491]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it.
[02:21:39.691 --> 02:21:41.012]  It's truly game-changing.
[02:21:41.012 --> 02:21:44.034]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different.
[02:21:44.034 --> 02:21:48.937]  Emrix Essentials, and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores.

[02:22:28.400 --> 02:22:31.262]  Many books have been written regarding the Law of Attraction.
[02:22:31.262 --> 02:22:37.747]  But what if all these books are missing the most important information we can use when it comes to activating this law in our lives?
[02:22:37.747 --> 02:22:48.155]  The new book, It's Time to Align, the most powerful self-help book ever written by Alan Lautinger, takes a look at how the Law of Attraction really works and how it is being suppressed in our lives.

[02:23:05.834 --> 02:23:07.436]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:23:07.436 --> 02:23:15.784]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[02:24:08.497 --> 02:24:10.038]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:10.038 --> 02:24:12.621]  Owen Troyer, David Knight, we are joined by Mark Dice.
[02:24:12.621 --> 02:24:16.824]  We're about to get back into the video of the top 10 moments from the Comey hearing.
[02:24:16.824 --> 02:24:22.549]  But you know, it's funny, they want to keep talking about the Russian influence on our election.
[02:24:22.549 --> 02:24:31.196]  But if you actually get down to the bottom line of what was Russia's influence, they have to ultimately come down to the WikiLeaks.
[02:24:31.556 --> 02:24:33.559]  Because they can't prove that any votes were changed.
[02:24:33.559 --> 02:24:38.325]  They can't prove that the actual electronic systems were hacked by the Russians.
[02:24:38.325 --> 02:24:43.893]  So what they say is, based on a third-party system, that the FBI and James Comey can't cooperate.
[02:24:44.761 --> 02:24:49.784]  That it was Russia that hacked the DNC and the DCCC, thus releasing those emails.
[02:24:49.784 --> 02:24:58.310]  So actually, what would have influenced the election would have been the contents of the WikiLeaks, but that's not the argument they want to have.
[02:24:58.310 --> 02:25:00.211]  They just want to say Russia, Russia, Russia.
[02:25:00.211 --> 02:25:01.091]  Ignore the content.
[02:25:01.091 --> 02:25:05.174]  So, let's go ahead, let's start back up with the best 10 moments from the Comey hearing.
[02:25:05.174 --> 02:25:08.776]  Mark, your microphone will be open too, so feel free to chime in.
[02:25:08.776 --> 02:25:09.777]  Go ahead and roll that video.
[02:25:10.776 --> 02:25:12.597]  Not in his words, no.
[02:25:12.597 --> 02:25:13.037]  Not in his words.
[02:25:39.491 --> 02:25:41.012]  Again, those words are not in order.
[02:25:41.012 --> 02:25:47.017]  And the reason I keep saying his words is, I took it as a direction.
[02:25:47.017 --> 02:25:53.463]  As the President of the United States, with me alone saying, I hope this, I took it as, this is what he wants me to do.
[02:25:53.463 --> 02:25:55.124]  I didn't obey that, but that's the way I took it.
[02:25:56.385 --> 02:25:59.046]  You know, his testimony here is a living document.
[02:25:59.046 --> 02:26:05.508]  You know, like, Mark, they always treat the Constitution and the law as if it doesn't really mean what it says.
[02:26:05.508 --> 02:26:08.469]  It's simply a living document that they can reinterpret.
[02:26:08.469 --> 02:26:11.209]  That's the whole issue that we have with Supreme Court nominees.
[02:26:11.209 --> 02:26:20.112]  And so, he writes this detailed romance novel about his involvement in the private involvement with Donald Trump, and then he doesn't stick to it.
[02:26:20.112 --> 02:26:23.593]  It's just a living document that he can then reinterpret about how he feels about it.
[02:26:24.820 --> 02:26:27.581]  President Trump didn't say you need to let this go.
[02:26:27.581 --> 02:26:29.382]  He didn't say you have to let this go.
[02:26:29.382 --> 02:26:30.502]  He didn't say let this go.
[02:26:30.502 --> 02:26:31.703]  He just expressed his hope.
[02:26:31.703 --> 02:26:42.487]  And the best part, if we're gonna play the rest of the clip, then it gets really good because Kony has painted himself into a corner because as a lawyer he knows that nobody can be convicted of a crime of just simply hoping for an outcome.
[02:26:42.487 --> 02:26:47.329]  You can't just be convicted or charged for hoping something bad happens or hoping
[02:26:48.677 --> 02:26:50.618]  For the best part, if you want to play the rest of the clip.
[02:26:50.618 --> 02:26:52.740]  Yeah, let's go ahead and play the rest of the clip, because that's exactly what he gets up to.
[02:26:52.740 --> 02:26:58.363]  But to be clear, again, even if Trump would have shut down the investigation, that is within his power!
[02:26:58.363 --> 02:27:02.366]  So it wouldn't have been illegal, even if he said, hey, Comey, drop this investigation.
[02:27:02.366 --> 02:27:03.106]  But that's not what he did.
[02:27:03.106 --> 02:27:04.467]  Go ahead and roll the clip.
[02:27:04.467 --> 02:27:12.152]  While it was a request that he hoped you did away with it, you perceived it as an order, given his position, the setting, and the like, and some of the circumstances.
[02:27:13.004 --> 02:27:14.265]  Yes.
[02:27:14.265 --> 02:27:19.590]  Do you believe that you were fired because you refused to take the president's direction?
[02:27:19.590 --> 02:27:21.491]  Is that the ultimate reason?
[02:27:21.491 --> 02:27:22.152]  I don't know for sure.
[02:27:22.152 --> 02:27:25.695]  Even though he didn't give you that direction.
[02:27:25.695 --> 02:27:35.884]  I know I was fired because of something about the way I was conducting the Russia investigation was in some way putting pressure on him, in some way irritating him, and he decided to fire me because of that.
[02:27:36.444 --> 02:27:37.964]  That's such a good gesture.
[02:27:37.964 --> 02:27:39.305]  Certainly a possible step, yes sir.
[02:28:02.150 --> 02:28:05.352]  Yes, from, I think, members of Congress.
[02:28:05.352 --> 02:28:07.133]  Oh, where was your memo on that?
[02:28:07.133 --> 02:28:10.995]  Yours truly did, on multiple occasions.
[02:28:10.995 --> 02:28:30.247]  And that heightened your concerns about the appearance of a conflict of interest with the Department of Justice, which caused you to make what you have described as an incredibly painful decision to basically take the matter up yourself, and led to that July press conference.
[02:28:31.127 --> 02:28:32.148]  Yes, sir.
[02:28:32.148 --> 02:28:41.775]  After the President Clinton, former President Clinton, met on the plane with the Attorney General, I considered whether I should call for the appointment of a special counsel.
[02:28:41.775 --> 02:28:46.258]  And I decided that that would be an unfair thing to do, because I knew there was no case there.
[02:28:46.258 --> 02:28:48.420]  We had investigated it very, very thoroughly.
[02:28:48.420 --> 02:28:52.623]  I know this is a subject of passionate disagreement, but I knew there was no case there.
[02:28:52.623 --> 02:28:54.725]  And calling for the appointment of a special counsel... Hold it!
[02:28:54.725 --> 02:28:55.345]  Hold it right there!
[02:28:55.345 --> 02:28:56.646]  This is unbelievable!
[02:28:56.646 --> 02:28:57.687]  He admitted there was a case!
[02:28:57.987 --> 02:29:02.788]  Well, he admitted that she'd committed felonies and that he didn't want to continue on with that prosecution.
[02:29:02.788 --> 02:29:03.428]  Your comments, Mark?
[02:29:03.428 --> 02:29:14.371]  And if we're going to go off of the intent being one of the primary reasons for indicting someone, President Trump did not intend that hoping was a direct order.
[02:29:14.371 --> 02:29:18.572]  And if he wasn't spelling it out in his words, I mean, what was he doing?
[02:29:18.572 --> 02:29:26.834]  Sending him, you know, signals via ESP or, you know, spelling it out in, you know, in barbecue sauce on his plate or in carrot sticks?
[02:29:26.954 --> 02:29:28.355]  Well, but it's so ridiculous!
[02:29:28.355 --> 02:29:38.459]  It's like, if you're the President of the United States, and you see this waste of time, waste of money, waste of resources, waste of energy, waste of everything, of course you want it stopped!
[02:29:38.459 --> 02:29:42.341]  But he's smart enough to know that Comey is a snake, so he was like, well, I hope you end this.
[02:29:42.341 --> 02:29:42.901]  He didn't.
[02:29:42.901 --> 02:29:44.822]  He said, okay, you're fine.
[02:29:44.822 --> 02:29:45.522]  That's what happened.
[02:29:45.522 --> 02:29:47.623]  Mark Dice, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:29:47.623 --> 02:29:49.044]  We'll be right back with Alex Jones.

[02:31:02.475 --> 02:31:03.777]  Devon in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:31:04.798 --> 02:31:05.239]  Great!
[02:31:05.239 --> 02:31:06.360]  Hey, thank you so much.
[02:31:06.360 --> 02:31:11.005]  Listen, I have bought your products, and I gotta say they're amazing.
[02:31:11.005 --> 02:31:12.746]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[02:31:12.746 --> 02:31:21.456]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret 12, 5mm Fusion, I've got the Body Armor... Wow, thank you.
[02:31:21.456 --> 02:31:23.778]  You're the top illustrator that makes it all possible.
[02:31:23.778 --> 02:31:25.380]  Which nutraceutical does he like best?
[02:31:25.620 --> 02:31:29.162]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[02:31:29.162 --> 02:31:30.483]  That's really incredible.
[02:31:30.483 --> 02:31:33.625]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[02:31:33.625 --> 02:31:34.986]  Like, I haven't felt this week.
[02:31:34.986 --> 02:31:36.687]  My morning was fantastic.
[02:31:36.687 --> 02:31:37.868]  And I love you guys.
[02:31:37.868 --> 02:31:40.209]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[02:31:40.209 --> 02:31:46.013]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence.
[02:31:46.013 --> 02:31:47.194]  Just buy it.
[02:31:47.194 --> 02:31:48.275]  You will love it.
[02:31:48.275 --> 02:31:48.775]  I'm telling you.
[02:31:48.775 --> 02:31:50.136]  I've never bought a bad product.
[02:31:50.456 --> 02:31:54.958]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:32:02.080 --> 02:32:04.721]  Get and stay healthy naturally with XtendoVite.
[02:32:04.721 --> 02:32:08.682]  Metals in the liver cause peroxides to get dumped into the bloodstream.
[02:32:08.682 --> 02:32:19.646]  Peroxides do more damage than free radicals to the arteries, and the LDL has no protection from peroxides, causing the LDL to get stuck in the arteries, creating a potential blockage.
[02:32:20.106 --> 02:32:28.508]  Xtendivite slowly chelates the metals away from the liver so it can dispose of what was meant to be a harmless process, peroxide.
[02:32:28.508 --> 02:32:33.410]  Xtendivite's 7 herbs has a job to strengthen the organs and circulatory highway.
[02:32:33.410 --> 02:32:35.070]  Can you afford a heart attack?
[02:32:35.070 --> 02:32:40.531]  Xtendivite is available in capsule or liquid form for just $69.95 for a 2 month supply.

[02:32:48.175 --> 02:33:04.211]  877-928-8822 or visit heartdrop.com InfoWars is the brainchild of radio host Alex Jones.
[02:33:04.211 --> 02:33:05.232]  Alex Jones.
[02:33:05.232 --> 02:33:05.933]  Alex Jones.
[02:33:05.933 --> 02:33:06.553]  Alex Jones.

[02:33:40.256 --> 02:33:44.417]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[02:33:44.417 --> 02:33:49.499]  Nobody can dispute the fact that you're a great... Infowars.com!
[02:33:49.499 --> 02:33:50.939]  Infowars.com.
[02:33:50.939 --> 02:33:52.399]  Infowars comes to mind.
[02:33:52.399 --> 02:33:53.200]  Infowars.
[02:33:53.200 --> 02:33:54.480]  Infowars.
[02:33:54.480 --> 02:33:55.440]  Infowars.
[02:33:55.440 --> 02:33:56.801]  You watch Infowars?
[02:33:56.801 --> 02:33:57.481]  Infowars.
[02:33:57.481 --> 02:33:58.281]  Infowars.
[02:33:58.281 --> 02:33:59.041]  Infowars.
[02:33:59.041 --> 02:33:59.981]  Infowars.
[02:33:59.981 --> 02:34:01.182]  Infowars.com.
[02:34:01.182 --> 02:34:02.702]  I want freedom!
[02:34:02.702 --> 02:34:03.662]  That's what I want!
[02:34:03.662 --> 02:34:04.983]  And that's what Jason wants!
[02:34:06.747 --> 02:34:13.155]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[02:34:13.155 --> 02:34:14.516]  I like that guy.
[02:34:14.516 --> 02:34:16.338]  That is the best!
[02:34:16.338 --> 02:34:21.464]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:34:37.185 --> 02:34:41.568]  There's a reason mainstream media is demonizing InfoWars.
[02:34:41.568 --> 02:34:46.450]  Because they know InfoWars is a symbol of human resistance.
[02:34:46.450 --> 02:34:50.493]  A symbol of a little man standing up against the power elite.
[02:34:50.493 --> 02:34:58.778]  And if they can destroy InfoWars, or at least create the illusion that we're being destroyed, they can try to intimidate you into submission.
[02:34:59.605 --> 02:35:06.647]  So let me give everybody a newsflash, including our supporters, those that are neutral, and our enemies.
[02:35:06.647 --> 02:35:14.630]  Infowars.com and our entire crew here on syndicated talk radio, TV, the internet, has never been more successful.
[02:35:14.630 --> 02:35:18.911]  We've never been reaching more people, and we've never been attacked more.
[02:35:18.911 --> 02:35:24.413]  So it is the best of times, the worst of times, a paradoxical tale of two cities.
[02:35:25.455 --> 02:35:35.918]  But before we go back to the Friday crew that's sitting in for me today while I take care of family issues, I want to just reach out to the viewers and listeners and let them understand something.
[02:35:35.918 --> 02:35:37.858]  Revolution is economic.
[02:35:37.858 --> 02:35:43.019]  Revolution is about being able to live your own life and being self-sufficient.
[02:35:43.019 --> 02:35:53.862]  Everything the globalists have been up to is about getting you off the land, getting you into compact cities, getting you into big box stores, and getting you to give up your control over your environment.
[02:35:55.148 --> 02:36:03.653]  Look at Bezos owning the Washington Post and getting $600 million from the CIA, admittedly, to put out lies against America, against the Second Amendment, and against Trump.
[02:36:03.653 --> 02:36:08.896]  When you go to Amazon and you buy products from there, you're funding the destruction of you and your family.
[02:36:08.896 --> 02:36:14.919]  Now, we still sell products there, but we're moving away from doing that because Bezos is sworn to destroy this country.
[02:36:15.967 --> 02:36:37.985]  When you go to infowarestore.com, you're on a website with a secure server, with a major platform, and you are buying great products, in many cases, lower prices and better quality than Amazon, from people that believe what you believe, in freedom, in security, in sovereignty, and in treating people like you want to be treated.
[02:36:37.985 --> 02:36:45.070]  So it was George Orwell that famously said, in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[02:36:45.811 --> 02:37:00.717]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have been wanting for a decade to go out and sell organic personal care products, shampoo, mouthwash, sunscreen, bug repellent, you name it.
[02:37:00.717 --> 02:37:04.559]  And we have spent many years trying to find the right company.
[02:37:04.559 --> 02:37:08.881]  And most of the big, organic, highly rated companies are globalist or liberal.
[02:37:09.821 --> 02:37:17.747]  But we finally found one that was the number three company in the nation for organic products and the owner is a listener.
[02:37:17.747 --> 02:37:27.154]  He has allowed us to come out with Emert's Essentials, private labeled his line of products, only the names is different, that has the exact same label.
[02:37:28.424 --> 02:37:32.085]  For 20% off what is sold in stores.
[02:37:32.085 --> 02:37:40.368]  And 25% additionally, that's 45% off when you sign up for AutoShip and InfoWareStore.com.
[02:37:40.368 --> 02:37:41.988]  It's Emmerich's Essentials.
[02:37:41.988 --> 02:37:42.769]  And ladies and gentlemen...
[02:37:43.849 --> 02:37:47.752]  Super high quality essential oils and other amazing compounds.
[02:37:47.752 --> 02:37:57.558]  10 to 1 concentrate, where you get a bottle of mouthwash for the same price as a big bottle of mouthwash that's watered down and isn't organic.
[02:37:57.558 --> 02:38:04.443]  10 to 1 concentrate, where you put just a tiny little bit in a glass of water, you know, 4 ounces of water, and then slosh it around your mouth.
[02:38:04.443 --> 02:38:07.385]  And it's so strong, I can't even hardly handle it.
[02:38:07.385 --> 02:38:09.526]  So it's more like 20 to 1.
[02:38:09.526 --> 02:38:12.989]  That's just one of the products at Emirates Essentials.
[02:38:12.989 --> 02:38:13.309]  And again,
[02:38:13.652 --> 02:38:13.759]  Yeah.
[02:38:14.520 --> 02:38:22.784]  This is the win-win, where you fund the InfoWar, you fund the revolution, you get products you need, it's a symbiotic relationship, it's a non-zero-sum game.
[02:38:22.784 --> 02:38:27.906]  Natural Herbal Body Wash, unscented, made with organic oils, amazing.
[02:38:27.906 --> 02:38:34.029]  Emrix Essentials, InfoWarsLife.com, available right now.
[02:38:34.029 --> 02:38:40.813]  Again, we have the SPF 30 Face and Body Lotion, sunscreen, broad spectrum, SPF 30, unscented.
[02:38:40.813 --> 02:38:43.534]  This is the non-nano zinc oxide,
[02:38:43.914 --> 02:38:48.336]  It's actually healthy and good and doesn't get into your bloodstream and hurt you.
[02:38:48.336 --> 02:38:53.118]  This is incredibly inexpensive compared to leading competitors and is much better.
[02:38:53.118 --> 02:39:01.442]  You save your skin, you save your complexion, while still getting the nutritive sun, while supporting the info war and promoting freedom.
[02:39:01.442 --> 02:39:06.665]  You save your teeth with the mouthwash, while also saving the republic and fighting the globalists.
[02:39:07.185 --> 02:39:12.488]  You have high-quality natural herbal body wash to be healthy and smell good while battling the globulus.
[02:39:12.488 --> 02:39:22.075]  It's a lifestyle that helps you and your family all the same time, spending money and supporting an organization that takes the globulus on fearlessly.
[02:39:22.075 --> 02:39:27.698]  We have Emmerich Essentials natural herbal shampoo with tea tree oil and so much more.
[02:39:27.698 --> 02:39:29.179]  We have BOA.
[02:39:29.179 --> 02:39:29.880]  Amazing!
[02:39:30.726 --> 02:39:38.032]  Anti-bug spray that is healthy, organic, and has compounds that are non-toxic and good for your body.
[02:39:38.032 --> 02:39:46.800]  Again, keep the nasty parasites away, the mosquitoes, the gnats, the biting flies, and support the InfoWar while you are at it.
[02:39:46.800 --> 02:39:49.562]  And then finally, the bestseller from Emmerich's Essentials.
[02:39:49.562 --> 02:39:53.465]  A lot of folks that have been to Whole Foods and other stores recognize this container.
[02:39:53.465 --> 02:39:55.787]  It's only the name's different, Emmerich's Essentials.
[02:39:55.787 --> 02:39:58.469]  This is one of the leading organic, high-quality,
[02:39:59.150 --> 02:40:08.672]  Deodorants in the country available at EmRicksEssentials and Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[02:40:08.672 --> 02:40:21.495]  It took us years to be able to find a top-tier private labeler of high quality products that would allow us to discount them and sell them direct to you via radio and TV and then support the InfoWar
[02:40:21.795 --> 02:40:23.177]  You cannot lose.
[02:40:23.177 --> 02:40:25.501]  You absolutely stand for the globalists.
[02:40:25.501 --> 02:40:26.662]  You defeat them.
[02:40:26.662 --> 02:40:29.927]  You let them know that the American people are never giving in.
[02:40:29.927 --> 02:40:35.576]  Now, let's get back to the live show with Owen Schroeder and David Knight and your calls and so much more.
[02:40:35.576 --> 02:40:37.218]  But just first, let me just say this again.
[02:40:37.819 --> 02:40:39.261]  This is an economic war.
[02:40:39.261 --> 02:40:40.542]  They want to starve us.
[02:40:40.542 --> 02:40:41.523]  They want to cut us off.
[02:40:41.523 --> 02:40:42.604]  They want to cut you off.
[02:40:42.604 --> 02:40:44.085]  They want to control the economy.
[02:40:44.085 --> 02:40:49.211]  They want to kill free market because it allows choice and competitiveness to build the world.
[02:40:49.211 --> 02:40:52.294]  When you buy the products that are excellent at Infowarsstore.com
[02:40:53.533 --> 02:40:58.335]  And when you spread the word about the broadcast, you break the back of the globalists and change the world.
[02:40:58.335 --> 02:41:01.617]  We're already starting to win, but the enemy's striking back.
[02:41:01.617 --> 02:41:09.361]  So now it's more important than ever to realize these economic lessons and engage in economic warfare by the purchases you decide to make every day.
[02:41:09.361 --> 02:41:15.984]  I'm not a big consumerist that just loves things, but I understand the power of using your choice to change the world.
[02:41:15.984 --> 02:41:21.106]  And that's what you do at InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com with Emmerich Essentials.
[02:41:21.106 --> 02:41:21.947]  Again, thank you all.
[02:41:28.260 --> 02:41:30.922]  Alright, David Knight with Owen Schroer here live in the studio.
[02:41:30.922 --> 02:41:34.024]  We have Mark Dice joining us and we're going to get right back to him.
[02:41:34.024 --> 02:41:35.925]  I just saw this on Drudge Report.
[02:41:35.925 --> 02:41:43.811]  In Boston today, Jeb Bush was asked if he thought the firing of James Comey by President Trump was an obstruction of justice.
[02:41:43.811 --> 02:41:45.392]  He said, no, I don't.
[02:41:46.192 --> 02:41:47.953]  But who cares what I think?
[02:41:47.953 --> 02:41:49.793]  He's right twice in one day.
[02:41:49.793 --> 02:41:51.734]  How about that?
[02:41:51.734 --> 02:41:55.136]  I guess he said, please care, please care, please applaud.
[02:41:55.136 --> 02:41:58.117]  So that's Jeb Bush is now weighed in on this.
[02:41:58.117 --> 02:42:00.298]  Mark Dice with MarkDice.com.
[02:42:00.298 --> 02:42:02.539]  I mean, we're going to get back to these clips, but...
[02:42:03.419 --> 02:42:06.861]  We've even got Jeb Bush defending Donald Trump.
[02:42:06.861 --> 02:42:09.342]  We had a great defense by Marco Rubio.
[02:42:09.342 --> 02:42:14.245]  I think the two people who were the best at the hearings were Marco Rubio and John Cornyn.
[02:42:14.245 --> 02:42:16.526]  They really laid it out in a narrative.
[02:42:16.526 --> 02:42:18.788]  They had thought about what they were going to talk about.
[02:42:18.788 --> 02:42:24.811]  They really walked Comey down this path to show how absurd what he was trying to put out there was.
[02:42:26.075 --> 02:42:27.317]  You know, Senator Reach was pretty good.
[02:42:27.317 --> 02:42:32.586]  He was the one who got Conway to paint himself into the corner and admit that hoping for an outcome is not a crime.
[02:42:32.586 --> 02:42:35.811]  And especially when there was no intent that that statement
[02:42:37.914 --> 02:42:45.239]  Let's not forget that Comey also said that he just wasn't strong enough to stand up to this supposed direction.
[02:42:45.239 --> 02:42:57.249]  Even Senator Dianne Feinstein was bewildered by this and asked him yesterday, you know, if this was so shocking, if you thought that this was an obstruction of justice, a violation of ethics, why didn't you say something?
[02:42:57.249 --> 02:43:00.251]  And his answer was, maybe if he was stronger.
[02:43:00.251 --> 02:43:02.213]  Well, that's another reason why you're fired.
[02:43:02.213 --> 02:43:05.956]  We don't need some cowardly clown to be the head of the FBI.
[02:43:06.618 --> 02:43:09.520]  Yeah, and we need somebody who's going to follow the law.
[02:43:09.520 --> 02:43:14.443]  If you've got somebody who is obstructing justice as a president, you are obliged to do that.
[02:43:14.443 --> 02:43:19.447]  But again, he's committed perjury, he's testified twice, saying two completely different things.
[02:43:19.447 --> 02:43:22.309]  One of them saying, no, no, no, he really did pressure me.
[02:43:22.309 --> 02:43:29.654]  He was implying that he wanted me to do this just as King Henry II implied that he wanted Beckett killed by saying that with a hoping.
[02:43:29.654 --> 02:43:35.178]  So he's saying that at the same time he's previously said nobody ever pressured me to stop this investigation, ever.
[02:43:35.638 --> 02:43:37.820]  Well, for political purposes, that'd be a big deal.
[02:43:37.820 --> 02:43:39.061]  Yeah, it would be a big deal.
[02:43:39.061 --> 02:43:51.012]  And it would be a big deal because you'd be an accessory to a crime if you don't talk about it until you get fired and get your feelings hurt because it was done while you were standing in front of a bunch of FBI agents about to do a presentation.
[02:43:51.012 --> 02:43:54.495]  Then the monitor behind you comes on and tells everybody you're fired.
[02:43:55.413 --> 02:43:55.513]  Let's
[02:44:14.701 --> 02:44:15.481]  It's bizarre.
[02:44:15.481 --> 02:44:17.382]  Captain Courageous.
[02:44:17.382 --> 02:44:19.282]  Oh Lordy.
[02:44:19.282 --> 02:44:23.804]  I mean, golly gee, Mr. Comey, I just don't see a case here.
[02:44:23.804 --> 02:44:27.525]  The guy, he needs to go away, crawl back into the hole that he came out of.
[02:44:27.525 --> 02:44:31.906]  His bag's under his eyes so big, I could put my groceries in them.
[02:44:31.906 --> 02:44:33.847]  The guy is obviously just so stressed out.
[02:44:33.847 --> 02:44:41.369]  You can imagine the kind of inner turmoil that he's facing from having basically sold his soul to the establishment of the deep state.
[02:44:41.929 --> 02:44:43.050]  Well, it's worked very well for him.
[02:44:43.050 --> 02:44:49.215]  He's had a very long career working for the deep state, working for the Clintons, covering up for the crimes of Politically Connected.
[02:44:49.215 --> 02:44:50.876]  He's been handsomely rewarded with this.
[02:44:50.876 --> 02:44:55.679]  I think he thought that he could vent his frustrations and that he would be exonerated.
[02:44:55.679 --> 02:44:59.863]  I hope that there's somebody in this Justice Department that is going to hold him to task.
[02:44:59.863 --> 02:45:09.330]  I believe, as I said before, the real story here, the dog that has not barked except around the periphery, is what Senator Grassley and Senator Rand Paul are saying, the big story here.
[02:45:09.830 --> 02:45:16.352]  That's how Barack Obama used the intelligence community, used law enforcement as his Watergate burglars.
[02:45:16.352 --> 02:45:18.272]  That's the big story here.
[02:45:18.272 --> 02:45:20.412]  And I think that we really need to look at this carefully.
[02:45:20.412 --> 02:45:26.414]  One of the things that he said that I thought was interesting was he said, when I met with President Trump, you know, we had this dirty dossier.
[02:45:26.414 --> 02:45:30.975]  He said, I didn't want him to think I was going to do some kind of a Jeg or Hoover thing on him.
[02:45:31.235 --> 02:45:35.878]  He knows precisely what J. Edgar Hoover was doing, blackmailing everybody on both sides of the aisle.
[02:45:35.878 --> 02:45:39.901]  That's precisely what his business model was, to stay in office.
[02:45:39.901 --> 02:45:42.963]  And he was connected to Christopher Steele.
[02:45:42.963 --> 02:45:44.544]  And that's what Senator Grassley is on.
[02:45:44.544 --> 02:45:45.804]  It's like, why did you hire this guy?
[02:45:45.804 --> 02:45:48.626]  Why did you contact him, send him money, so forth?
[02:45:48.626 --> 02:45:49.667]  We want to see the documents.
[02:45:49.667 --> 02:45:51.728]  And he would not respond to that either.
[02:45:51.728 --> 02:46:00.414]  Yet another reason to have him fired, and another reason to have him investigated and tried by a Justice Department if we're not going to have people who are above the law.
[02:46:01.972 --> 02:46:10.495]  Fake news is kind of the big buzzword and that's what they are, but we really need to introduce again or just to emphasize that they are also the mockingbird media.
[02:46:10.495 --> 02:46:17.557]  We need to keep bringing up Operation Mockingbird, the program which was exposed during intelligence committee hearings back in the 1970s.
[02:46:19.137 --> 02:46:29.361]  Of which, part of their report I have sitting here in front of me, the church hearings, where this was a Senate committee investigating CIA intelligence activities into the United States.
[02:46:29.361 --> 02:46:33.302]  And of course their charter says that they're only supposed to do things for foreign governments.
[02:46:33.302 --> 02:46:40.545]  But this is from the actual church hearing report, talking about the manipulation of the media by the Central Intelligence Agency.
[02:46:41.425 --> 02:46:47.929]  Quote, the CIA maintained covert relationships with about 50 American journalists or employees of U.S.
[02:46:47.929 --> 02:46:49.690]  media organizations.
[02:46:49.690 --> 02:46:59.996]  They are part of a network of several hundred individuals around the world who provide intelligence for the CIA and at times to influence opinion through the use of covert propaganda.
[02:46:59.996 --> 02:47:10.502]  These individuals provide the CIA with direct access to a large number of newspapers, periodicals, scores of press services, news agencies, radio, television stations, commercial book publishers,
[02:47:10.942 --> 02:47:16.856]  And of course, after they were busted manipulating the media...
[02:47:18.846 --> 02:47:19.626]  Same old story.
[02:47:19.626 --> 02:47:20.767]  Well, sorry, we just won't do it again.
[02:47:20.767 --> 02:47:22.208]  We just won't do it again.
[02:47:22.208 --> 02:47:29.593]  Even though shortly after this hearing, somebody asked the former president of CBS, Sid Mickelson, if he thinks that such a thing still happens.
[02:47:29.593 --> 02:47:32.175]  And of course, he said that, of course it does.
[02:47:32.175 --> 02:47:34.917]  They just have to be a lot more secretive about it.
[02:47:34.917 --> 02:47:45.023]  Well, yeah, look no further than the Washington Post, or excuse me, the Amazon Post, where you have Jeff Bezos, who gets hundreds of millions of dollars of government contracts owning a newspaper.
[02:47:45.023 --> 02:47:45.744]  I mean, it's right there.
[02:47:46.653 --> 02:47:50.075]  Yeah, yeah, he's running the data services for the CIA.
[02:47:50.075 --> 02:47:56.459]  Guys, pull up that clip of Michael Hayden when he said, I don't listen to bad people, I listen to interesting people.
[02:47:56.459 --> 02:48:00.181]  And the other one where he talks about his basis, his authority here.
[02:48:00.181 --> 02:48:03.943]  Because, you know, Mark Dice, you brought up the church committee hearings.
[02:48:03.943 --> 02:48:05.164]  One of the reasons that came up
[02:48:05.524 --> 02:48:11.108]  Was because they knew that they were listening to American citizens, that they were violating their charter.
[02:48:11.108 --> 02:48:14.230]  They said, in the Pike hearings, they said, I want to see the charter of the NSA.
[02:48:14.230 --> 02:48:15.431]  And they said, no, I'm not going to show it to you.
[02:48:15.431 --> 02:48:17.693]  We were created by executive order by President Truman.
[02:48:17.693 --> 02:48:19.634]  We're not even going to show you our charter.
[02:48:19.634 --> 02:48:20.795]  So they were concerned about that.
[02:48:20.795 --> 02:48:27.700]  And now we have the FISA court blowing the whistle on these illegal actions by the FBI, by the NSA.
[02:48:27.700 --> 02:48:30.122]  And do you guys have that clip ready of Hayden?
[02:48:30.122 --> 02:48:31.143]  OK, let's play that Hayden clip.
[02:48:32.193 --> 02:48:33.594]  This is not about guilt.
[02:48:33.594 --> 02:48:38.316]  In fact, let me be really clear.
[02:48:38.316 --> 02:48:43.038]  NSA doesn't just listen to bad people.
[02:48:43.038 --> 02:48:45.359]  NSA listens to interesting people.
[02:48:45.359 --> 02:48:48.200]  Interesting people.
[02:48:48.200 --> 02:48:48.781]  Now listen to this.
[02:48:52.521 --> 02:48:52.701]  215?
[02:48:52.701 --> 02:48:55.264]  215 is such a safe haven.
[02:48:55.264 --> 02:48:57.767]  215 is legislated by Congress.
[02:48:57.767 --> 02:49:04.254]  I was doing metadata collection under the President's raw Article 2 authorities from October 7, 2001 forward.
[02:49:04.254 --> 02:49:06.697]  The 215 program doesn't begin with the Patriot Act.
[02:49:07.568 --> 02:49:10.650]  That begins with the private order I got from President Bush.
[02:49:10.650 --> 02:49:15.534]  And we decided it was lawful and consistent with the President's authorities as Commander-in-Chief.
[02:49:15.534 --> 02:49:16.715]  We decided.
[02:49:16.715 --> 02:49:19.357]  I didn't need even the Patriot Act.
[02:49:19.357 --> 02:49:21.278]  I had a direct order from the President.
[02:49:21.278 --> 02:49:27.903]  And so the key in what Senator Grassley is saying is, was Obama, the Obama administration, were they using
[02:49:28.323 --> 02:49:38.529]  These people, the NSA, people like Michael Hayden, who is interested in interesting people, not in bad people, who does whatever the President tells him regardless of what the law is.
[02:49:38.529 --> 02:49:40.811]  Were these people following the orders of Obama?
[02:49:40.811 --> 02:49:44.813]  Were they acting as his political Watergate plumbers?
[02:49:44.813 --> 02:49:48.376]  That's, I think, really the issue that hasn't really come to the forefront, Mark.
[02:49:49.963 --> 02:50:04.923]  Well, the media is using their agenda-setting power and framing the conversation in order to continuously attempt to paint Trump as some sort of treasonous traitor to create an environment to encourage more people who will, what they hoped, leak more damaging information.
[02:50:09.640 --> 02:50:10.381]  Daniel Ellsberg
[02:50:31.360 --> 02:50:45.146]  A willing victim of the mainstream media and of our celebrity propaganda culture, really parroting the talking point, the wish of Madonna, who of course verbally expressed that she too had thought about blowing up the White House.
[02:50:45.146 --> 02:50:46.687]  So we see reality winners.
[02:50:46.687 --> 02:50:50.248]  She was not interested in exposing bad people and bad actions.
[02:50:50.248 --> 02:50:53.490]  She wanted to expose an interesting political enemy.
[02:50:53.490 --> 02:50:53.910]  Stay with us.
[02:50:53.910 --> 02:50:58.652]  We'll be right back with Mark Dice, Owen Schroer, and we're going to have the Trump press conference.
[02:50:58.652 --> 02:51:00.153]  We'll join as soon as it begins.
[02:51:00.353 --> 02:51:01.734]  Want to become more self-sufficient?
[02:51:01.734 --> 02:51:03.975]  Then you need to have your own energy source.

[02:51:29.588 --> 02:51:34.390]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[02:51:34.390 --> 02:51:40.253]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[02:51:40.253 --> 02:51:46.775]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[02:51:46.775 --> 02:51:50.637]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.

[02:52:09.765 --> 02:52:11.586]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[02:52:11.826 --> 02:52:14.668]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:52:14.668 --> 02:52:16.148]  It's made in the USA.
[02:52:16.148 --> 02:52:22.932]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the inflow organ.
[02:52:22.932 --> 02:52:25.013]  It is a classical 360 win.
[02:52:25.013 --> 02:52:34.658]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:52:34.658 --> 02:52:39.641]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that
[02:52:39.741 --> 02:52:51.385]  Patriots, stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.

[02:53:31.727 --> 02:53:36.288]  There is no denying now that Trump will go down in history, both despised and admired.

[02:54:15.496 --> 02:54:16.997]  I'm David Knight with Owen Schroeder.
[02:54:16.997 --> 02:54:18.838]  We also have Mark Dice on the line.
[02:54:18.838 --> 02:54:21.480]  MarkDice.com is where you can find him.
[02:54:21.480 --> 02:54:27.904]  Before we get back to the news here, we're going to leave Mark live here as we go to the Trump press conference.
[02:54:27.904 --> 02:54:32.448]  I just want to remind you of our new line of essential organic household products.
[02:54:32.448 --> 02:54:37.171]  As Owen was talking about things like DEET that you find in insect repellent.
[02:54:37.171 --> 02:54:39.092]  That is a very toxic substance.
[02:54:39.092 --> 02:54:39.673]  So we have a
[02:54:40.253 --> 02:54:40.493]  I think?
[02:54:58.644 --> 02:55:02.025]  Like Nancy Pelosi, or John McCain, as we saw yesterday.
[02:55:02.025 --> 02:55:04.565]  So don't use aluminum in your deodorant.
[02:55:04.565 --> 02:55:06.446]  That's the key thing about these natural ingredients.
[02:55:06.446 --> 02:55:15.587]  We've identified toxic elements that are unusual household products, and we've come up with better household products that are based on natural, organic ingredients.
[02:55:15.587 --> 02:55:22.209]  Also, BioTruth Saloonam is now available 25% off at Infowarslife.com while supplies last.
[02:55:22.209 --> 02:55:27.650]  Let's leave Mark's mic open, and let's go to Trump's press conference, which is just beginning.
[02:55:29.249 --> 02:55:32.372]  They have to end that funding.
[02:55:32.372 --> 02:55:38.977]  And it's extremist ideology in terms of funding.
[02:55:38.977 --> 02:55:47.283]  I want to call on all of the nations to stop immediately supporting terrorism.
[02:55:47.283 --> 02:55:50.526]  Stop teaching people to kill other people.
[02:55:50.526 --> 02:55:54.969]  Stop filling their minds with hate and intolerance.
[02:55:54.969 --> 02:55:56.631]  I won't name other countries
[02:55:58.578 --> 02:56:04.720]  But we are not done solving the problem, but we will solve that problem.
[02:56:04.720 --> 02:56:08.042]  Have no choice.
[02:56:08.042 --> 02:56:17.285]  This is my great priority because it is my first duty as president to keep our people safe.
[02:56:17.285 --> 02:56:24.188]  Defeating ISIS and other terror organizations is something I have emphasized all during
[02:56:25.356 --> 02:56:28.717]  I don't think he's talking to the Rebels.
[02:56:43.061 --> 02:56:47.424]  So is he going to give this directive to the CIA about funding ISIS?
[02:56:47.424 --> 02:56:54.028]  Is he going to stand up for the president of Syria, Assad, who is attempting to do that?
[02:56:54.028 --> 02:56:58.610]  Who actually walked amongst his people today without a bodyguard, if you can call it that.
[02:56:58.610 --> 02:57:10.838]  I want to thank Saudi Arabia, the evil dictator, and my friend King Salman, and all of the countries who participated in that very historic summit.
[02:57:11.616 --> 02:57:14.839]  Put a lot of onus on Saudi Arabia right now.
[02:57:14.839 --> 02:57:15.981]  Yeah, a lot of emphasis on that.
[02:57:15.981 --> 02:57:20.325]  He's not talking right now, he's not reacting to the Comey press conference.
[02:57:20.325 --> 02:57:21.486]  Mark, was there something else?
[02:57:21.486 --> 02:57:23.628]  Because we're about to run out of time.
[02:57:23.628 --> 02:57:27.452]  He's just prefacing these remarks with a visiting dignitary.
[02:57:27.452 --> 02:57:30.676]  Something you wanted to say to give some closing remarks about the Comey hearings yesterday?
[02:57:32.600 --> 02:57:37.706]  I noticed that the media was actually triggered and upset because he didn't live tweet the event.
[02:57:37.706 --> 02:57:38.988]  Those were real stories.
[02:57:38.988 --> 02:57:43.234]  CNN and some of the other major media outlets were upset that he hasn't tweeted.
[02:57:43.234 --> 02:57:43.955]  That's great news.
[02:57:43.955 --> 02:57:45.937]  He just sat back and won.
[02:57:45.937 --> 02:57:47.579]  When he tweets, it's news.
[02:57:47.579 --> 02:57:49.181]  When he doesn't tweet, it's news.
[02:57:49.802 --> 02:57:50.463]  Thanks for having me, guys.
[02:57:50.463 --> 02:57:56.888]  It's great to be in good company of the news organization that Hillary Clinton has blamed as being largely responsible for her loss.
[02:57:56.888 --> 02:58:00.311]  So, I know I'm in good company every time I'm with you guys.
[02:58:00.311 --> 02:58:07.736]  Well, I was very happy to see that he let his lawyer come out and respond to this, and his lawyer hit it like a laser beam.
[02:58:07.736 --> 02:58:12.160]  He said, what we have seen here are illegal leaks of classified information, privileged communication.
[02:58:12.160 --> 02:58:13.381]  Mr. Comey has now admitted
[02:58:14.061 --> 02:58:21.908]  You know what else?
[02:58:21.908 --> 02:58:25.731]  Hey, you know what else he admitted?
[02:58:25.731 --> 02:58:27.312]  He admitted he's a coward.
[02:58:27.312 --> 02:58:34.158]  So my guess is you put him in front of a private prosecutor, he's gonna sing like a bird and the Clintons will go down.
[02:58:34.158 --> 02:58:35.639]  James Comey is a coward.
[02:58:35.639 --> 02:58:36.820]  Thank you for joining us, Mark.
[02:58:36.820 --> 02:58:38.081]  MarkDice.com.
[02:58:38.081 --> 02:58:38.881]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:38.881 --> 02:58:39.442]  You got it.
[02:58:39.442 --> 02:58:40.543]  Sick of winning yet, guys?
[02:58:40.543 --> 02:58:40.823]  Nope.
[02:58:40.823 --> 02:58:42.024]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:43.484 --> 02:58:51.587]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.587 --> 02:58:56.409]  Chelsea Clinton has just released a new children's book!
[02:58:59.062 --> 02:59:06.548]  And it's about 13 historical women who pursued their goals in the face of opposition.
[02:59:06.548 --> 02:59:25.323]  The rebel media caught up with Chelsea at a book signing event and had the brilliant idea of asking her to sign the book titled, She Persisted, for Juanita Broderick, who as we all know, was sexually assaulted by Bill Clinton and silenced by Hillary.
[02:59:25.663 --> 02:59:31.347]  Can you sign it for my friend Juanita Broderick, because she's been silenced by her parents, especially Bill Clinton, who's a rapist.
[02:59:31.347 --> 02:59:33.349]  Can you sign it for her?
[02:59:33.349 --> 02:59:40.314]  Naturally, Chelsea refused to sign the book, but her reaction was priceless.
[02:59:40.314 --> 02:59:52.044]  And you can watch the video in its entirety right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:59:52.044 --> 02:59:54.646]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:11.940 --> 03:00:17.622]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:00:17.622 --> 03:00:19.862]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:00:24.893 --> 03:00:26.134]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:26.134 --> 03:00:27.455]  I'm David Knight with Oren Schroer.
[03:00:27.455 --> 03:00:33.440]  On this Friday, June 9th, 2017, President Trump is currently having a press conference.
[03:00:33.440 --> 03:00:39.445]  He's reading remarks, but it's going to get, I think, very interesting once he starts to take questions.
[03:00:39.445 --> 03:00:46.930]  Everybody is very anxious to get some direct comments from him on the Comey hearings yesterday, and I'm sure there are going to be a lot of questions about that.
[03:00:46.930 --> 03:00:52.535]  We're going to join that press conference, and Mark Cernovich is going to be picking up the fourth hour.
[03:00:52.535 --> 03:00:53.736]  But here's this press conference.
[03:00:53.736 --> 03:00:53.976]  Go ahead.
[03:00:54.056 --> 03:00:57.138]  Thank you so much for arranging this nice weather in this place.
[03:00:57.138 --> 03:00:59.619]  It's the president of Romania speaking now.
[03:00:59.619 --> 03:01:07.923]  Mr. President, I'm very glad that we had such a good meeting.
[03:01:07.923 --> 03:01:10.284]  Trump, such an isolationist.
[03:01:10.284 --> 03:01:17.168]  Due to your strong leadership, and this is also due to our strong partnership.
[03:01:17.168 --> 03:01:23.491]  Obviously, the fact that we celebrate 20 years of strategic partnership this year,
[03:01:25.416 --> 03:01:41.641]  It's important for both our nations and it is important to know, and this is what I want to underline, that this partnership with the United States of America shaped Romania
[03:01:42.701 --> 03:01:44.743]  As it is today.
[03:01:44.743 --> 03:01:52.370]  Romania, a solid democracy with a solid... Wait, Western values uplifted a nation?
[03:01:52.370 --> 03:01:53.911]  Oh my gosh, don't tell the liberals.
[03:01:53.911 --> 03:02:02.119]  Romania, which stands together with the US troops in Afghanistan.
[03:02:02.119 --> 03:02:06.263]  We stand together in Iraq.
[03:02:06.263 --> 03:02:07.123]  Mr. President,
[03:02:08.223 --> 03:02:13.987]  This partnership contributed greatly to what Romania is today.
[03:02:13.987 --> 03:02:20.331]  And this partnership was and is very important.
[03:02:20.331 --> 03:02:20.852]  And I think
[03:02:22.301 --> 03:02:29.023]  This partnership not only has to continue, this partnership has to become stronger.
[03:02:29.023 --> 03:02:41.086]  This partnership has to define our bilateral relation, and this partnership has to contribute to solve so many problems.
[03:02:41.086 --> 03:02:43.667]  President Trump, you mentioned terrorism.
[03:02:43.667 --> 03:02:51.509]  I'm very glad that, due to your strong leadership, NATO decided to go against terrorism.
[03:02:54.113 --> 03:03:04.116]  Your involvement made so many nations conscious of the fact that we have to share the burden inside NATO.
[03:03:04.116 --> 03:03:20.180]  This is why Romania also decided, and if I'm right, I think this is the first country during your mandate to step up to 2% of GDP for defense spending.
[03:03:21.795 --> 03:03:28.280]  A significant part of this defense spending is going into strategic acquisitions.
[03:03:28.280 --> 03:03:38.849]  And I hope, President Trump, that we find good ways together to use, to make good use of this money.
[03:03:38.849 --> 03:03:44.734]  I find it interesting that he was talking about our bilateral relationships when he's part of the European Union.
[03:03:45.695 --> 03:03:51.157]  So, clearly he does not want to see the European Union taking away his national sovereignty.
[03:03:51.157 --> 03:03:58.640]  They suffered under the Soviet Union for a long time, and it's a satellite dictatorship, Ceausescu, so... The key here is bilateral.
[03:04:02.816 --> 03:04:04.356]  We're not isolationists.
[03:04:04.356 --> 03:04:14.720]  We just don't want to have supranational organizations or unions like the Soviet Union or the European Union to take over these relationships between nations.
[03:04:14.720 --> 03:04:17.260]  And this is very important.
[03:04:17.260 --> 03:04:20.381]  Romania is a member of the European Union.
[03:04:20.381 --> 03:04:29.384]  And I think it's the best interest of you, Mr. President, to have a strong European Union as a partner.
[03:04:31.454 --> 03:04:33.715]  This is vital for all of us.
[03:04:33.715 --> 03:04:41.040]  The President of the European Union has made it very clear that the individual nations are not really allowed to have these bilateral relations.
[03:04:41.040 --> 03:04:42.401]  Everything has to go through them.
[03:04:42.401 --> 03:04:44.542]  So, he's saying both things here.
[03:04:44.542 --> 03:04:49.085]  It's at the basis of our Western civilization.
[03:04:49.085 --> 03:04:50.206]  Transatlantic League.
[03:04:50.206 --> 03:04:52.887]  Okay, we'll see if he's going to push the Transatlantic Partnership.
[03:04:52.887 --> 03:04:53.648]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:53.648 --> 03:04:56.950]  David Knight, Owen Schroyer, Mark Sendrovich is coming up in the fourth hour.
[03:05:00.327 --> 03:05:04.568]  Some important revelations came out during James Comey's testimony.
[03:05:04.568 --> 03:05:15.312]  Democrats hoping to have Trump impeached for obstruction of justice were greatly let down when Comey's testimony revealed that President Trump was innocent of those false allegations.
[03:05:15.312 --> 03:05:25.915]  One revelation was that President Trump was not under investigation by the FBI, dispelling rumors perpetuated by the mainstream media that Trump fired Comey as retaliation
[03:05:27.856 --> 03:05:32.079]  Another was that Comey admitted leaking his memos to the media.
[03:05:32.079 --> 03:05:37.142]  The memos that further stirred suspicions against Trump for alleged Russian involvement.
[03:05:37.142 --> 03:05:44.106]  However, coincidentally, the fact that Trump wasn't under FBI investigation was never leaked to the media.
[03:05:44.106 --> 03:05:54.913]  Comey's testimony also revealed that our suspicions about Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch's bizarre meeting on the tarmac were valid and may even prompt further investigation.
[03:05:55.393 --> 03:05:57.589]  For more reports, go to InfoWars.com.
[03:05:57.589 --> 03:05:58.394]  This is Mellie Weaver.
[03:05:59.784 --> 03:06:08.869]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:06:08.869 --> 03:06:17.274]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:06:17.274 --> 03:06:22.156]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[03:06:22.156 --> 03:06:28.560]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[03:06:28.920 --> 03:06:36.104]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[03:06:36.104 --> 03:06:43.128]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[03:06:43.128 --> 03:06:47.611]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[03:06:47.611 --> 03:06:50.833]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[03:06:50.993 --> 03:06:57.307]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[03:06:57.307 --> 03:06:58.991]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[03:07:01.147 --> 03:07:04.910]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:07:04.910 --> 03:07:12.655]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:07:12.655 --> 03:07:21.280]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:07:21.280 --> 03:07:25.683]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:07:25.683 --> 03:07:31.067]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[03:07:31.267 --> 03:07:35.509]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[03:07:35.509 --> 03:07:38.911]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[03:07:38.911 --> 03:07:50.056]  AnthroPlex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[03:07:50.056 --> 03:07:52.957]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[03:07:52.957 --> 03:07:58.920]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[03:08:16.657 --> 03:08:21.760]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:21.760 --> 03:08:26.463]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:08:28.803 --> 03:08:33.947]  You know, I've heard through the grapevine that Megyn Kelly doesn't think too much of me.
[03:08:33.947 --> 03:08:36.148]  She calls me fake news, not a real journalist.
[03:08:36.148 --> 03:08:43.654]  I'd like to see Megyn Kelly, one time in her life, inherent a desk that is filled with a hundred news stories, hundreds of notes.
[03:08:43.654 --> 03:08:46.596]  I've got three broadcasts going on my computer, more news stories.
[03:08:46.596 --> 03:08:49.919]  Megyn Kelly's hair would fall out if she ever got put in a position like this.
[03:08:49.919 --> 03:08:54.202]  So, looking forward to see Megyn Kelly trying to hit peace, InfoWars and Alex Jones.
[03:08:54.202 --> 03:08:55.343]  It's only going to backfire on her.
[03:08:55.723 --> 03:09:04.168]  Yes, this is what it's like when you're a real reporter trying to engage and engulf all the information, literally all this news.
[03:09:04.168 --> 03:09:06.009]  Okay, but let's get back to the real story.
[03:09:06.009 --> 03:09:13.413]  That is, President Trump is about to take questions on, I am assuming the press is going to be asking him all about the Comey hearing.
[03:09:13.413 --> 03:09:16.755]  Let's go ahead and go to that, guys.
[03:09:16.755 --> 03:09:18.676]  Dave Boyer, Washington Times.
[03:09:26.676 --> 03:09:27.417]  Come on, Dave.
[03:09:27.417 --> 03:09:29.239]  Thank you, Mr. President.
[03:09:29.239 --> 03:09:29.959]  Apologies.
[03:09:29.959 --> 03:09:31.200]  That's all right, Dave.
[03:09:31.200 --> 03:09:39.829]  Mr. President, this morning on Twitter, you were referring to the testimony of James Comey vindicating you.
[03:09:39.829 --> 03:09:46.475]  But I wondered if you could tell us in person, sir, why you feel that his testimony vindicated you when it's really
[03:09:47.476 --> 03:09:49.978]  It boils down to his word against your word.
[03:09:49.978 --> 03:09:54.421]  And if you could also tell us, sir, do tapes exist of your conversations with him?
[03:09:54.421 --> 03:09:57.764]  Well, I'll tell you about that maybe sometime in the very near future.
[03:09:57.764 --> 03:10:02.748]  But in the meantime, no collusion, no obstruction.
[03:10:02.748 --> 03:10:04.489]  He's a leaker.
[03:10:04.489 --> 03:10:09.072]  But we want to get back to running our great country.
[03:10:09.072 --> 03:10:13.456]  Jobs, trade deficits, we want them to disappear fast.
[03:10:13.456 --> 03:10:14.697]  North Korea, big problem.
[03:10:15.578 --> 03:10:18.380]  Middle East, a big problem.
[03:10:18.380 --> 03:10:19.961]  So that's what I am focused on.
[03:10:19.961 --> 03:10:22.362]  That's what I have been focused on.
[03:10:22.362 --> 03:10:26.945]  But yesterday showed no collusion, no obstruction.
[03:10:26.945 --> 03:10:29.727]  We are doing really well.
[03:10:29.727 --> 03:10:39.874]  That was an excuse by the Democrats who lost an election that some people think they shouldn't have lost because it's almost impossible for the Democrats to lose the Electoral College, as you know.
[03:10:40.774 --> 03:10:46.700]  You have to run up the whole East Coast and you have to win everything as a Republican, and that's just what we did.
[03:10:46.700 --> 03:10:49.382]  So it was just an excuse.
[03:10:49.382 --> 03:10:52.826]  But we were very, very happy.
[03:10:52.826 --> 03:10:58.171]  And frankly, James Comey confirmed a lot of what I said.
[03:10:58.171 --> 03:11:01.094]  And some of the things that he said just weren't true.
[03:11:01.094 --> 03:11:01.734]  Thank you very much.
[03:11:02.717 --> 03:11:09.831]  He said yes immediately after the Do You Have Tapes question, but I'm not sure if he was answering the question or if he was just responding to the question.
[03:11:09.831 --> 03:11:10.512]  That was interesting though.
[03:11:10.512 --> 03:11:11.675]  I wonder if he does have those tapes.
[03:11:15.763 --> 03:11:17.484]  Thank you.
[03:11:17.484 --> 03:11:42.318]  And Mr. President, if you could tell us, a couple weeks ago, President Trump was in Brussels at the NATO meeting, and not only was he encouraging NATO members to pay up the 2% required of GDP for national defense, but he also was saying that countries, including yours, who had not paid 2% in the past should make up for that difference.
[03:11:42.318 --> 03:11:43.019]  Do you think that's fair?
[03:11:46.829 --> 03:11:55.675]  I was in Brussels, and I met President Trump, and I listened to his speech, and I liked it.
[03:11:55.675 --> 03:12:06.542]  Because, you see, NATO is based on values, but it is ultimately a military alliance.
[03:12:06.542 --> 03:12:12.706]  And you know, military spendings are complicated, and you need a lot of money.
[03:12:13.427 --> 03:12:24.654]  You know, a lot of these people probably feel and they think the same things that Trump thinks, they see the same things that Trump sees, but they are just, like Comey said, too cowardly to say it.
[03:12:24.654 --> 03:12:38.822]  You know, Klaus probably may have thought a lot of these things that Trump said in his speech, but he always felt, if I come out and I say this on the floor of a NATO meeting or a UN meeting, I'm not going to endear myself to any of these leaders, so I'm just going to hold my tongue.
[03:12:38.822 --> 03:12:39.723]  Well, here comes Trump.
[03:12:40.223 --> 03:12:48.929]  He basically gives a middle finger to what all these people think, and he just speaks his mind, tells it like it is, and so then other presidents are like, hmm, actually I agree with that.
[03:12:48.929 --> 03:12:50.490]  Maybe I can start to speak like that.
[03:12:50.490 --> 03:12:51.430]  Thank you, President Trump.
[03:12:51.430 --> 03:12:56.994]  We have to do this, not as a purpose in itself.
[03:12:56.994 --> 03:13:03.218]  We have to do this to stay strong, to be strong, and to defend our nations.
[03:13:04.842 --> 03:13:05.903]  100% correct.
[03:13:05.903 --> 03:13:15.868]  And, you know, one of the things I was referring to during that speech was the fact that, yes, they haven't paid what they should be paying now, but for many years they haven't been paying.
[03:13:15.868 --> 03:13:22.252]  So I said, do we ever go back and say, how about paying the money from many, many years past?
[03:13:22.252 --> 03:13:23.533]  And that's how a businessman thinks.
[03:13:23.533 --> 03:13:26.134]  I know no president has ever asked that question.
[03:13:26.134 --> 03:13:28.956]  Because no president's a successful businessman like Trump.
[03:13:28.956 --> 03:13:30.437]  We're going to make NATO very strong.
[03:13:31.482 --> 03:13:32.903]  You need the money to make it strong.
[03:13:32.903 --> 03:13:36.466]  You can't just do what we've been doing in the past.
[03:13:36.466 --> 03:13:40.189]  So I did say, yes, you haven't paid this year.
[03:13:40.189 --> 03:13:44.332]  But what about the past years, the many past years where you haven't paid?
[03:13:44.332 --> 03:13:50.157]  Perhaps you should pay some or all of that money back.
[03:13:50.157 --> 03:13:50.798]  You have a question?
[03:13:56.044 --> 03:13:56.365]  Thank you.
[03:13:56.365 --> 03:14:01.458]  I have a question for President Trump.
[03:14:01.458 --> 03:14:04.746]  On the matter of security, sir, you
[03:14:06.537 --> 03:14:15.979]  Many of the countries on the eastern flank of NATO, including Romania, see Russia as a threat to the security and the peace in the region.
[03:14:15.979 --> 03:14:27.942]  Do you share this vision and do you think that the United States should act under Article 5 if any of this country will be under military aggression?
[03:14:27.942 --> 03:14:28.582]  Thank you very much.
[03:14:29.477 --> 03:14:36.541]  Well, I'm committing the United States, and have committed, but I'm committing the United States to Article 5.
[03:14:36.541 --> 03:14:49.167]  And certainly we are there to protect, and that's one of the reasons that I want people to make sure we have a very, very strong force by paying the kind of money necessary to have that force.
[03:14:49.167 --> 03:14:51.908]  But yes, absolutely I'd be committed to Article 5.
[03:15:00.393 --> 03:15:00.813]  Thank you.
[03:15:00.813 --> 03:15:06.275]  Mr. President, were there any discussion about the visa waiver program for Romania?
[03:15:06.275 --> 03:15:09.977]  Is there a time frame for including our country in this program?
[03:15:09.977 --> 03:15:11.797]  Thank you.
[03:15:11.797 --> 03:15:13.338]  We did discuss it.
[03:15:13.338 --> 03:15:18.460]  We didn't discuss it, but there would be certainly, it would be something we will discuss, Mr. President.
[03:15:19.962 --> 03:15:30.529]  I mentioned this issue and I also mentioned it during other meetings I had because this is important for us, it's important for Romanians.
[03:15:30.529 --> 03:15:34.471]  This is a Romanian president having a joint press conference with President Donald Trump.
[03:15:34.471 --> 03:15:37.913]  More and more people come, President Trump, from Romania.
[03:15:40.996 --> 03:15:46.041]  Some come as tourists, some come for business and those who come for business should be encouraged.
[03:15:46.041 --> 03:15:56.551]  So the matter of visa waiver would be probably important to discuss and we all hope that we will advance on this.
[03:16:01.714 --> 03:16:03.095]  Mr. President.
[03:16:03.095 --> 03:16:04.856]  Oh, and look at those hands up there, President.
[03:16:04.856 --> 03:16:06.396]  Do you have this in Romania, too?
[03:16:06.396 --> 03:16:07.837]  I don't know.
[03:16:07.837 --> 03:16:09.618]  I've got the microphone.
[03:16:09.618 --> 03:16:10.979]  If you'll allow me, Mr. President.
[03:16:10.979 --> 03:16:12.319]  If I could only sell that.
[03:16:12.319 --> 03:16:15.161]  If I could only sell it.
[03:16:15.161 --> 03:16:16.021]  Who would like to ask?
[03:16:16.021 --> 03:16:21.664]  Should I take one of the killer networks that treat me so badly as fake news?
[03:16:21.664 --> 03:16:25.386]  Trump calling out the fake news right on the White House lawn.
[03:16:25.386 --> 03:16:26.206]  Go ahead, John.
[03:16:29.122 --> 03:16:30.143]  Be fair, John.
[03:16:30.143 --> 03:16:30.683]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:16:30.683 --> 03:16:33.466]  Remember how nice you used to be before I ran?
[03:16:33.466 --> 03:16:34.667]  Such a nice man.
[03:16:34.667 --> 03:16:36.248]  Always fair.
[03:16:36.248 --> 03:16:39.651]  Mr. President, I want to get back to James Comey's testimony.
[03:16:39.651 --> 03:16:42.874]  You suggested he didn't tell the truth in everything he said.
[03:16:42.874 --> 03:16:49.660]  He did say, under oath, that you told him to let the Flynn... You said you hoped the Flynn investigation... I didn't say that.
[03:16:51.650 --> 03:16:52.791]  So he lied about that?
[03:16:52.791 --> 03:16:54.231]  Well, I didn't say that.
[03:16:54.231 --> 03:16:56.133]  I mean, I will tell you, I didn't say that.
[03:16:56.133 --> 03:16:58.414]  And did he ask you to pledge loyalty?
[03:16:58.414 --> 03:17:03.216]  And there'd be nothing wrong if I did say it according to everybody that I've read today, but I did not say that.
[03:17:03.216 --> 03:17:03.717]  Bingo.
[03:17:03.717 --> 03:17:04.077]  Shocking.
[03:17:04.077 --> 03:17:06.258]  And did he ask for a pledge of loyalty from you?
[03:17:06.258 --> 03:17:07.179]  That's another thing he said.
[03:17:07.179 --> 03:17:08.199]  No, he did not.
[03:17:08.199 --> 03:17:09.720]  So he said those things under oath.
[03:17:09.720 --> 03:17:13.962]  Would you be willing to speak under oath to give your version of those events?
[03:17:13.962 --> 03:17:15.343]  One hundred percent.
[03:17:15.343 --> 03:17:15.643]  Wow!
[03:17:15.643 --> 03:17:16.744]  I didn't say under oath.
[03:17:17.344 --> 03:17:18.165]  It makes you wonder about those tapes.
[03:17:18.165 --> 03:17:18.705]  I hardly know the man.
[03:17:18.705 --> 03:17:20.927]  I'm not going to say, I want you to pledge allegiance.
[03:17:20.927 --> 03:17:21.928]  Who would do that?
[03:17:21.928 --> 03:17:25.111]  Who would ask a man to pledge allegiance under oath?
[03:17:25.111 --> 03:17:26.052]  I mean, think of it.
[03:17:26.052 --> 03:17:27.794]  I hardly know the man.
[03:17:27.794 --> 03:17:29.055]  It doesn't make sense.
[03:17:29.055 --> 03:17:31.437]  No, I didn't say that, and I didn't say the other.
[03:17:31.437 --> 03:17:34.740]  So if Robert Mueller wanted to speak with you about that, you would be willing to talk to him?
[03:17:34.740 --> 03:17:36.541]  I would be glad to tell him exactly what I just told you, Jim.
[03:17:36.541 --> 03:17:39.244]  And you seem to be hinting that there are recordings of those conferences.
[03:17:39.244 --> 03:17:39.944]  But again, it doesn't even matter.
[03:17:39.944 --> 03:17:40.585]  I'm not hinting anything.
[03:17:40.585 --> 03:17:42.787]  I'll tell you about it over a very short period of time.
[03:17:42.787 --> 03:17:43.628]  When is that?
[03:17:44.605 --> 03:17:47.347]  Okay, do you have a question here?
[03:17:47.347 --> 03:17:48.167]  Hi, fake news.
[03:17:48.167 --> 03:17:49.368]  I'm playing chess.
[03:17:49.368 --> 03:17:52.290]  You're still trying to commentate a checkers match.
[03:17:52.290 --> 03:17:53.050]  Are there tapes, sir?
[03:17:53.050 --> 03:17:56.972]  Oh, you're going to be very disappointed when you hear the answer.
[03:17:56.972 --> 03:17:58.093]  Don't worry.
[03:17:58.093 --> 03:17:59.774]  John, do you have a question for the president?
[03:18:00.154 --> 03:18:00.714]  Yes.
[03:18:00.714 --> 03:18:01.234]  Thank you.
[03:18:01.234 --> 03:18:02.695]  She is 10 moves ahead of these people.
[03:18:02.695 --> 03:18:03.195]  It's not even funny.
[03:18:03.195 --> 03:18:04.876]  You are no stranger to Russian aggression.
[03:18:04.876 --> 03:18:11.718]  Vladimir Putin recently suggested that Romania could be in Russia's crosshairs.
[03:18:11.718 --> 03:18:15.259]  How concerned should the world be about Russian aggression in your region?
[03:18:15.259 --> 03:18:19.000]  And how concerned should we be here in the United States about what Russia is trying to do in our region?
[03:18:19.000 --> 03:18:19.300]  This is absurd.
[03:18:19.300 --> 03:18:19.840]  Russian aggression.
[03:18:19.840 --> 03:18:21.181]  How about United States aggression?
[03:18:21.181 --> 03:18:26.202]  It's a joke.
[03:18:26.202 --> 03:18:27.763]  Everybody's concerned.
[03:18:27.763 --> 03:18:28.243]  But you see,
[03:18:29.671 --> 03:18:35.257]  Being concerned should lead you to being prepared.
[03:18:35.257 --> 03:18:43.666]  So, in my opinion, we have to be very clear, very simple, and very straightforward.
[03:18:43.666 --> 03:18:44.206]  See, I don't like this.
[03:18:44.206 --> 03:18:45.207]  They're trying to demonize Russia.
[03:18:45.207 --> 03:18:47.089]  Come right out and say, quit demonizing Russia.
[03:18:47.089 --> 03:18:49.311]  They're not the problem.
[03:18:49.311 --> 03:18:52.715]  In my opinion, we need dialogue.
[03:18:54.893 --> 03:19:04.097]  But, on the other hand, we need what we all together decided in NATO, a strong deterrence.
[03:19:04.097 --> 03:19:16.222]  So this combination, strong deterrence... What we need is for the establishment and the deep state to quit using Russia as their red herring, as their scarecrow.
[03:19:25.103 --> 03:19:35.292]  Hello Mr. President Trump, you mentioned... Alright guys, so again, you are listening to... Hey guys, in fact, if you just want to pause that and see if Mike wants to take that over when he takes over on the other side.
[03:19:35.292 --> 03:19:39.676]  Again, that is President Trump and the President of Romania having a joint press conference.
[03:19:39.676 --> 03:19:43.319]  I'm sure that there will be more questions regarding Comey and his hearing.
[03:19:43.319 --> 03:19:46.502]  On the other side, Mike Cernovich will be taking over.
[03:19:46.502 --> 03:19:47.102]  Don't go anywhere.

[03:24:18.029 --> 03:24:19.349]  Stan, we're back!
[03:24:19.349 --> 03:24:23.071]  Mike Cernich is guest hosting the fourth hour for the Real Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:23.071 --> 03:24:24.731]  We're gonna work on some bumper music.
[03:24:24.731 --> 03:24:28.833]  I got an email about some new bumper music, so of course we're gonna do that.
[03:24:28.833 --> 03:24:36.916]  We're about to go to the Trump press conference right now, but before we do, I got my InfoWars Caveman formula stuff right here.
[03:24:36.916 --> 03:24:39.776]  It's actually what I drink before I go on air.
[03:24:39.776 --> 03:24:41.597]  And that's InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:24:41.597 --> 03:24:44.878]  I think they're out of the Caveman stuff, but there's a lot of great products.
[03:24:44.878 --> 03:24:46.599]  The Super Glue toothpaste is back in stock.
[03:24:47.239 --> 03:24:52.282]  So be sure to support the Infowars and they are great products because even I use them.
[03:24:52.282 --> 03:24:57.666]  So without further ado, I guess when Trump is on the air, that's where everybody wants to be, including myself.
[03:24:57.666 --> 03:25:01.248]  So let's go watch Trump.
[03:25:01.248 --> 03:25:11.975]  But we see now that the anti-corruption fight and the efforts to consolidate the rule of law are sometimes undermined by some politicians.
[03:25:11.975 --> 03:25:14.737]  Part of what we can call the Bucharest swamp.
[03:25:15.695 --> 03:25:21.321]  Is your administration going to support the anti-corruption fight in Romania, and how can you do it?
[03:25:21.321 --> 03:25:22.362]  Thank you.
[03:25:22.362 --> 03:25:26.086]  Well, we support, very strongly, Romania.
[03:25:26.086 --> 03:25:30.270]  And therefore, obviously, we do support that fight on anti-corruption.
[03:25:30.270 --> 03:25:32.132]  We will always support that.
[03:25:32.132 --> 03:25:33.473]  And we support your president.
[03:25:33.473 --> 03:25:35.796]  We think he's done an outstanding job.
[03:25:35.796 --> 03:25:37.938]  Very popular.
[03:25:37.938 --> 03:25:38.679]  Very solid.
[03:25:39.724 --> 03:25:40.685]  Working very hard.
[03:25:40.685 --> 03:25:43.047]  We know everything that's going on.
[03:25:43.047 --> 03:25:45.209]  And he's going to win that fight.
[03:25:45.209 --> 03:25:46.130]  He's going to win that battle.
[03:25:46.130 --> 03:25:48.072]  But he has our support.
[03:25:48.072 --> 03:25:49.913]  Thank you so much.
[03:25:53.214 --> 03:26:03.606]  For the U.S.-Romania partnership and for the American investor as a trade because we still have corruption in Romania despite this anti-corruption fight.
[03:26:03.606 --> 03:26:09.712]  There you go, but I can tell you that there are many American investors right now going to Romania and investing
[03:26:10.393 --> 03:26:28.850]  In fact I was given a charge just before our meeting and we have people going over to Romania and investing and they weren't doing that a number of years ago so that shows very very big progress and there really are a lot of congratulations in store but a lot of people are investing from our country to yours and
[03:26:29.611 --> 03:26:36.895]  People love from Romania the United States and they come here a lot and we're very proud of them.
[03:26:36.895 --> 03:26:38.256]  Thank you all very much.
[03:26:38.256 --> 03:26:38.996]  Thank you.
[03:26:38.996 --> 03:26:39.757]  Thank you very much.
[03:26:39.757 --> 03:26:44.560]  Mr. President, how can he be a liar and vindicate you?
[03:26:47.901 --> 03:26:48.742]  So there they go.
[03:26:48.742 --> 03:26:52.244]  You can see them, you know, they shout the questions out of Trump.
[03:26:52.244 --> 03:27:02.691]  That's why I kind of laughed that when I was in the press briefing room, they acted like I committed some kind of major faux pas because I, you know, shouted out my question as Spicer was walking away.
[03:27:03.411 --> 03:27:09.075]  So they were saying, well, how can you call Comey a liar and also claim that you were vindicated?
[03:27:09.075 --> 03:27:14.800]  And then of course they giggle like a bunch of high school people, because that's ultimately what the fake news media people are.
[03:27:14.800 --> 03:27:16.081]  They're a bunch of high school people.
[03:27:16.081 --> 03:27:17.742]  They're not serious thinkers.
[03:27:17.742 --> 03:27:19.824]  They're not intellectuals.
[03:27:19.824 --> 03:27:22.025]  And that's the way they act.
[03:27:22.025 --> 03:27:23.526]  So there's something that I've been working on.
[03:27:23.526 --> 03:27:25.688]  I've been getting a lot of Romanian readers and viewers.
[03:27:25.688 --> 03:27:30.812]  And by the way, if you live in Romania, and I know that InfoWars is a worldwide audience, as is mine.
[03:27:31.846 --> 03:27:41.634]  George Soros, I've been getting a lot of reports that George Soros is actually in Romania and he's trying to destroy the Romanian people the same way he's coming to America.
[03:27:41.634 --> 03:27:42.635]  Yeah, Romania.
[03:27:42.635 --> 03:27:44.937]  I tweeted out Romania Soros is next target.
[03:27:44.937 --> 03:27:46.338]  Keep your eyes on Romania.
[03:27:46.338 --> 03:27:46.598]  Wow.
[03:27:46.598 --> 03:27:48.760]  So I tweeted that actually March 30, 2017.
[03:27:48.760 --> 03:27:57.307]  And the next thing you know, next thing you know, Trump is having a joint press conference with the president of Romania.
[03:27:57.307 --> 03:28:01.250]  And that really just goes to show how ahead of the curve Infowars is.
[03:28:02.230 --> 03:28:07.152]  Alex is, I am, that we know right away where, so yeah, did you see any wars in the Balkans?
[03:28:07.152 --> 03:28:10.153]  Looks like Soros and Babs are trying to disrupt in Macedonia.
[03:28:10.153 --> 03:28:13.454]  Yeah, Macedonia is another hotspot, Kosovo.
[03:28:13.454 --> 03:28:28.119]  Soros is trying to take over those Eastern European countries where the people still have a sense of identity and a sense of national pride and where they're nationalist people and they don't want to allow the globalists come in to destroy them the way they're destroying Germany.
[03:28:29.045 --> 03:28:32.506]  Austria, the UK now of course is a complete total mess.
[03:28:32.506 --> 03:28:39.827]  Soros is over there on these smaller, less affluent Eastern European countries and he's throwing a lot of money there.
[03:28:39.827 --> 03:28:43.348]  He's throwing a lot of fake news there too.
[03:28:43.348 --> 03:28:48.729]  So I bet you there were some of the journalists in that crowd asking about Romania.
[03:28:48.729 --> 03:28:53.430]  They were actually on the payroll of George Soros.
[03:28:53.430 --> 03:28:55.070]  So he has his claws in everywhere.
[03:28:55.070 --> 03:28:57.951]  So Romania, we're actually thinking about sending somebody down there
[03:28:58.755 --> 03:29:06.500]  To monitor the situation and get the inside story of Romania because we're in this amazing time where everything is kind of connected.
[03:29:06.500 --> 03:29:12.323]  The globalists have treated everything like puzzle pieces of the puzzles of chess pieces, however you want to look at it.
[03:29:12.323 --> 03:29:19.387]  They're moving everything around and they always start in these smaller Eastern European countries because they don't draw a lot of attention, right?
[03:29:19.387 --> 03:29:24.750]  I mean if Alex Jones and I go in the air and make a joke about Barack Obama's daughter, that is like world news.
[03:29:24.750 --> 03:29:26.191]  It's in every major publication.
[03:29:26.969 --> 03:29:35.155]  But these actual big affairs that you have happening in countries like Macedonia, Romania, they get completely buried, and they never reach out to the news cycle.
[03:29:35.155 --> 03:29:39.118]  There's a reason for that, but Cosoros tells the media they're not allowed to talk about that.
[03:29:39.118 --> 03:29:42.100]  So when we come back more, there's so much to talk about.
[03:29:42.100 --> 03:29:43.861]  We are overwhelmed with the news cycle.
[03:29:43.861 --> 03:29:48.945]  So I'm going to be back after the break to talk about Comey, what happened yesterday, and more.
[03:29:48.945 --> 03:29:50.326]  We're on the march.
[03:29:50.326 --> 03:29:52.868]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.868 --> 03:29:55.550]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.591 --> 03:30:02.033]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[03:30:02.033 --> 03:30:03.354]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:30:03.354 --> 03:30:04.574]  Why is this so good?
[03:30:04.574 --> 03:30:09.858]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:30:09.858 --> 03:30:23.409]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[03:30:23.409 --> 03:30:24.770]  Right now with all the refugees,
[03:30:25.530 --> 03:30:27.171]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[03:30:27.171 --> 03:30:29.753]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:30:29.753 --> 03:30:31.054]  These are all parasites.
[03:30:31.054 --> 03:30:32.154]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[03:30:32.154 --> 03:30:33.515]  There's so many things that are in it.
[03:30:33.515 --> 03:30:37.998]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[03:30:37.998 --> 03:30:41.180]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:30:41.280 --> 03:30:44.341]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:30:44.341 --> 03:30:45.381]  It just came back in yesterday.
[03:30:45.381 --> 03:30:47.322]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[03:30:47.322 --> 03:30:48.343]  And folks, you can't lose.

[03:30:56.545 --> 03:31:00.867]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[03:31:00.867 --> 03:31:02.327]  Let's go to Devon in Florida.
[03:31:02.327 --> 03:31:03.628]  Devon in Florida, you're on the air.
[03:31:04.645 --> 03:31:05.085]  Great!
[03:31:05.085 --> 03:31:06.227]  Hey, thank you so much.
[03:31:06.227 --> 03:31:10.811]  Listen, I have bought your products and I gotta say they're amazing.
[03:31:10.811 --> 03:31:11.051]  Thank you.
[03:31:11.051 --> 03:31:12.612]  Anyone who's on the fence, buy it.
[03:31:12.612 --> 03:31:20.359]  Because I've got Caveman, Superman Vitality, Secret Slow, Platinum Interfusion, I've got the Body Armor.
[03:31:20.359 --> 03:31:21.100]  Wow, thank you.
[03:31:21.100 --> 03:31:21.741]  Wow.
[03:31:21.741 --> 03:31:23.642]  You're the type of listener that makes it all possible.
[03:31:23.642 --> 03:31:25.224]  Which nutraceutical does he like best?
[03:31:25.464 --> 03:31:29.045]  I really like the Vitamin Mineral Fusion, to be honest.
[03:31:29.045 --> 03:31:30.345]  That's really incredible.
[03:31:30.345 --> 03:31:33.486]  I drank it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible.
[03:31:33.486 --> 03:31:34.866]  Like, I haven't felt it in a week.
[03:31:34.866 --> 03:31:36.547]  My morning was fantastic.
[03:31:36.547 --> 03:31:37.727]  And I love you guys.
[03:31:37.727 --> 03:31:40.048]  I love the Info Wars crew.
[03:31:40.048 --> 03:31:47.029]  And I just want to, yeah, I want to take this opportunity to tell anybody out there who's on the fence, just buy it.
[03:31:47.029 --> 03:31:48.129]  You will love it.
[03:31:48.129 --> 03:31:48.630]  I'm telling you.
[03:31:48.630 --> 03:31:49.990]  I've never bought a bad product.
[03:31:50.310 --> 03:31:54.820]  What you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.

[03:31:55.742 --> 03:31:56.744]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:31:59.457 --> 03:32:04.239]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[03:32:04.239 --> 03:32:10.122]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[03:32:10.122 --> 03:32:16.626]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[03:32:16.626 --> 03:32:20.668]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.

[03:32:30.338 --> 03:32:32.139]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[03:32:32.139 --> 03:32:33.801]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[03:32:33.801 --> 03:32:36.623]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[03:32:36.623 --> 03:32:38.905]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[03:32:38.905 --> 03:32:43.429]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless case.
[03:32:43.429 --> 03:32:47.372]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[03:32:47.372 --> 03:32:51.135]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[03:32:51.135 --> 03:32:51.576]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.
[03:32:51.576 --> 03:32:53.197]  That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[03:33:03.061 --> 03:33:09.642]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:09.642 --> 03:33:21.125]  And we're back with Mike Cernovich, twitter.com forward slash c-e-r-n-o-v-i-c-h, and there is so much talk about it's hard to keep track.
[03:33:27.401 --> 03:33:31.182]  But let's talk about right now, celebrity degeneracy.
[03:33:31.182 --> 03:33:35.563]  Why Hollywood is pro-terrorist and why Hollywood is pro-degeneracy.
[03:33:35.563 --> 03:33:39.564]  Because we, I mean, there's so much to talk about with them because they're always degenerates.
[03:33:39.564 --> 03:33:45.865]  But something interesting happened and I'm not sure the producers have the story loaded up yet, but reality winner.
[03:33:45.865 --> 03:33:47.486]  She was the leaker.
[03:33:47.486 --> 03:33:51.126]  She leaked a classified information to the Intercept and was busted.
[03:33:51.126 --> 03:33:53.147]  Rosie O'Donnell called her a hero.
[03:33:53.920 --> 03:34:03.624]  She called her a patriot and donated $1,000 to the legal defense fund of this person, Reality Winner, who is a leaker and domestic terrorist.
[03:34:03.624 --> 03:34:11.407]  Well, breaking news is that Reality Winner has said that she wanted to fight with Iran against the United States.
[03:34:11.407 --> 03:34:16.089]  And moreover, she wanted to join ISIS and burn down the White House.
[03:34:16.089 --> 03:34:17.969]  You literally, you cannot make this stuff up.
[03:34:17.969 --> 03:34:19.590]  That is how vile these people are.
[03:34:20.470 --> 03:34:23.271]  This is who Rosie O'Donnell is supporting.
[03:34:23.271 --> 03:34:30.455]  She is supporting, yes, beautiful, so reality winner, planned to burn down the White House, pledged allegiance to the Taliban.
[03:34:30.455 --> 03:34:36.338]  Now, the reason this is important is because Rosie O'Donnell called her on her Twitter in her tweets.
[03:34:36.338 --> 03:34:41.301]  Rosie linked to her legal GoFundMe reality winners and said, this is a hero.
[03:34:41.301 --> 03:34:44.322]  I'm donating $1,000 to terrorists.
[03:34:44.322 --> 03:34:46.323]  And that is why, you know, Alex talks about it.
[03:34:46.323 --> 03:34:47.564]  I talk about it all the time.
[03:34:48.314 --> 03:34:51.436]  You know, I realize that people do, you know, we are human beings.
[03:34:51.436 --> 03:34:52.477]  We do enjoy movies.
[03:34:52.477 --> 03:34:53.758]  We do enjoy art.
[03:34:53.758 --> 03:34:55.860]  We do enjoy entertainment.
[03:34:55.860 --> 03:34:59.042]  But Hollywood are literally funding terrorists.
[03:34:59.042 --> 03:34:59.462]  There you go.
[03:34:59.462 --> 03:35:03.585]  Rosie O'Donnell gives a brave young patriot $1,000.
[03:35:03.585 --> 03:35:06.147]  So we have right here proof.
[03:35:06.147 --> 03:35:07.048]  Hollywood.
[03:35:07.048 --> 03:35:12.331]  Rosie O'Donnell is funding ISIS, funding domestic terrorist organizations.
[03:35:12.331 --> 03:35:14.433]  But this is par for the course of Hollywood.
[03:35:14.433 --> 03:35:15.654]  This isn't even unusual.
[03:35:16.368 --> 03:35:25.875]  We have Roman Polanski, who, you know, I'm not going to go into graphic details, but he did, he completely violated a 13 year old girl.
[03:35:25.875 --> 03:35:29.158]  Rather than accept justice, he fled the country.
[03:35:29.158 --> 03:35:31.039]  He is a hero of the left.
[03:35:31.039 --> 03:35:33.621]  Meryl Streep gave him a standing ovation.
[03:35:33.621 --> 03:35:37.945]  Meryl Streep had said that Roman Polanski was being unfairly treated.
[03:35:37.945 --> 03:35:40.847]  These are the same people who are going after the patriots in America.
[03:35:41.781 --> 03:35:43.701]  These are the same people who go after Donald Trump.
[03:35:43.701 --> 03:35:56.424]  So Rosie O'Donnell has funded money to a terrorist, a domestic terrorist, reality winner, and encouraged other people to support somebody who wanted to join the Taliban and burn down the White House.
[03:35:56.424 --> 03:36:02.525]  We have Meryl Streep, who goes on these award shows and criticizes Donald Trump.
[03:36:02.525 --> 03:36:07.106]  Meanwhile, she gives a standing ovation to a child rapist, Roman Polanski.
[03:36:07.106 --> 03:36:09.527]  These are all things, that's the whole thing, the fake news media.
[03:36:10.436 --> 03:36:22.322]  It's always going after Alex and Infowars and everybody listening here and me and everybody, because we call attention to the, not just the generosity in Hollywood, to the pedophilia, to the terrorism.
[03:36:22.322 --> 03:36:25.544]  It isn't just that they're promoting an anti-family lifestyle.
[03:36:25.544 --> 03:36:32.027]  It isn't just that they're trying to divide people among racial lines and religious lines and among the gender lines and trying to destroy the family.
[03:36:32.027 --> 03:36:33.007]  That's bad.
[03:36:33.007 --> 03:36:34.068]  Surely.
[03:36:34.068 --> 03:36:35.789]  That's bad enough on its own.
[03:36:35.789 --> 03:36:38.230]  But what they're actually doing is they're promoting terrorism.
[03:36:38.717 --> 03:36:42.298]  And they are promoting pedophiles and pedophilia like Roman Polanski.
[03:36:42.298 --> 03:36:46.019]  They won't disavow Roman Polanski and pedophile.
[03:36:46.019 --> 03:36:49.560]  So I've noticed that a lot of these celebrities are obsessed with Alex Jones and me.
[03:36:49.560 --> 03:36:54.801]  So we have now a shared stalker, Alec Baldwin.
[03:36:54.801 --> 03:36:58.783]  So Alec Baldwin is another hero of the left.
[03:36:58.783 --> 03:36:59.703]  What is Alec Baldwin?
[03:36:59.703 --> 03:37:02.904]  Well, he abuses women, children.
[03:37:02.904 --> 03:37:07.425]  There's this audio and I don't even know if we can, I don't even know if we can play it because it's so vile.
[03:37:08.317 --> 03:37:09.518]  And once again, I've made an ass
[03:37:38.644 --> 03:37:44.089]  Of myself trying to get to a phone to call you at a specific time.
[03:37:44.089 --> 03:37:51.636]  When the time comes for me to make the phone call, I stop whatever I'm doing, and I go when I make that phone call.
[03:37:51.636 --> 03:37:59.703]  At 11 o'clock in the morning in New York, and if you don't pick up the phone at 10 o'clock at night, and you don't even have that goddamn phone turned on.
[03:37:59.703 --> 03:38:01.985]  I want you to know something, okay?
[03:38:01.985 --> 03:38:03.867]  I'm tired of playing this game with you.
[03:38:04.857 --> 03:38:11.351]  I'm leaving this message with you to tell you, you have insulted me for the last time.
[03:38:11.351 --> 03:38:12.714]  You have insulted me.
[03:38:12.714 --> 03:38:13.977]  You don't have the brains?
[03:38:14.597 --> 03:38:15.117]  Unbelievable.
[03:38:15.117 --> 03:38:15.557]  This is terrible.
[03:38:15.557 --> 03:38:15.697]  Really.
[03:38:15.697 --> 03:38:17.078]  I mean, he didn't even know how old he was.
[03:38:17.078 --> 03:38:18.418]  I don't know if you're 11 or 12.
[03:38:18.418 --> 03:38:19.078]  Screaming at her.
[03:38:19.078 --> 03:38:20.378]  So what I find interesting is that
[03:38:38.186 --> 03:38:48.889]  I just find it so interesting that, you know, when Alex Jones is involved in a custody dispute and Alex Jones is a great father, beloved by his children, that's big news.
[03:38:48.889 --> 03:38:52.450]  But Alec Baldwin emotionally abuses an 11-year-old girl or maybe 12.
[03:38:52.450 --> 03:38:53.430]  He doesn't know.
[03:38:53.430 --> 03:38:55.771]  Oh, you're maybe 11, you're maybe 12.
[03:38:55.771 --> 03:38:58.231]  That guy is welcome back in Hollywood.
[03:38:58.231 --> 03:39:00.472]  Welcome back on Saturday Night Live.
[03:39:00.472 --> 03:39:02.993]  30 Rock is as if that didn't happen.
[03:39:02.993 --> 03:39:07.854]  But if one of us makes a satirical comment one day on Twitter, clear satire,
[03:39:08.502 --> 03:39:11.683]  They use that against us for the rest of our lives.
[03:39:11.683 --> 03:39:15.083]  They'll take things that Alex Jones said out of context.
[03:39:15.083 --> 03:39:16.584]  And this is Hollywood.
[03:39:16.584 --> 03:39:18.684]  They hate everyone listening.
[03:39:18.684 --> 03:39:22.665]  If you're listening and you're an American patriot, they do want to fund ISIS.
[03:39:22.665 --> 03:39:24.605]  They do want to support pedophiles.
[03:39:24.605 --> 03:39:27.766]  They do want to fund the work of Roman Polanski.
[03:39:27.766 --> 03:39:30.586]  Underage children abusers like Alec Baldwin.
[03:39:30.586 --> 03:39:32.667]  That guy is the hero of Hollywood.
[03:39:32.667 --> 03:39:33.587]  He's the hero of the left.
[03:39:33.587 --> 03:39:35.067]  Rosie O'Donnell is the hero of the left.
[03:39:35.808 --> 03:39:39.591]  Madonna has said she wanted to burn down the White House and blow it up.
[03:39:39.591 --> 03:39:47.737]  You can't keep track, but Christian Bale did an interview with the Daily Beast about me where he talked about me and hated me so much.
[03:39:47.737 --> 03:39:49.619]  But you know what this excites me?
[03:39:49.619 --> 03:39:51.080]  See, that's the difference.
[03:39:51.080 --> 03:39:54.523]  Because when you're just, when you're brand new to this, right?
[03:39:54.523 --> 03:39:57.925]  A lot of this can weigh down on you.
[03:39:57.925 --> 03:40:00.067]  Because as human beings, we're wired.
[03:40:00.067 --> 03:40:01.668]  We want to be liked.
[03:40:01.668 --> 03:40:04.791]  But what you learn is that we are judged by our enemies.
[03:40:05.646 --> 03:40:07.246]  Think about it.
[03:40:07.246 --> 03:40:11.008]  Alec Baldwin, an underage child abuser.
[03:40:11.008 --> 03:40:13.728]  Rosie O'Donnell, funding domestic terrorism.
[03:40:13.728 --> 03:40:16.729]  Christian Bale, another guy with anger management problems.
[03:40:16.729 --> 03:40:20.230]  These are the kind of people who are going after us.
[03:40:20.230 --> 03:40:23.451]  We are judged by our enemies, the good people.
[03:40:23.451 --> 03:40:25.392]  The Patriots don't come after us.
[03:40:25.392 --> 03:40:31.393]  When have you ever heard a Patriot be saying nasty things about Alex Jones or Mike Cernovich or InfoWars?
[03:40:31.393 --> 03:40:33.054]  You don't hear the Patriots saying anything about it.
[03:40:33.618 --> 03:40:38.340]  It's always the woman abusers, the pedophiles, the terrorists who come after us.
[03:40:38.340 --> 03:40:46.502]  And that is again why the support is so essential, why InfoWarsStore.com and InfoWarsLife.com is so important because the toothpaste is back in stock.
[03:40:46.502 --> 03:40:51.324]  And what I always tell people is everybody needs toothpaste, right?
[03:40:51.324 --> 03:40:51.944]  I can get it.
[03:40:51.944 --> 03:40:53.745]  I drink the caveman stuff, right?
[03:40:53.745 --> 03:40:54.605]  I go to the gym.
[03:40:54.605 --> 03:40:55.405]  I run hard.
[03:40:55.405 --> 03:40:56.966]  So for me, I'm more about the
[03:40:57.748 --> 03:40:59.329]  The physical enhancement kind of stuff.
[03:40:59.329 --> 03:41:05.313]  But I get that not everybody is, but everybody here watching and listening, everybody uses toothpaste.
[03:41:05.313 --> 03:41:11.616]  If all everybody did was buy their toothpaste from Infoboros, they could triple operations overnight.
[03:41:11.616 --> 03:41:24.124]  If that's all people did, if they didn't ever buy the caveman stuff or the selenium or the supplements or the great nutraceuticals, if all people did was say, I'm committed to putting the toothpaste on auto-check,
[03:41:24.684 --> 03:41:25.305]  Thank you for watching!
[03:41:38.362 --> 03:41:43.384]  Because what a lot of people don't realize is this is what funds the information war.
[03:41:43.384 --> 03:41:44.765]  We don't have Hollywood.
[03:41:44.765 --> 03:41:46.205]  We don't have big Hollywood block.
[03:41:46.205 --> 03:41:49.086]  Could you imagine what we could do with $100 million?
[03:41:49.086 --> 03:41:59.451]  Could you imagine if we had the budgets that they had in Hollywood, but you can never get that kind of budget because if you're a true American patriot, they actually do the opposite.
[03:41:59.451 --> 03:42:00.711]  They try to shut you down.
[03:42:00.711 --> 03:42:07.974]  I've even had, I have a lot of friends, believe it or not, in the entertainment industry, and they've all told me the same thing, which is that
[03:42:08.815 --> 03:42:11.437]  I can never in public say that I can support Trump.
[03:42:11.437 --> 03:42:17.961]  I can never in public say that I believe in the patriotism because their careers will be over.
[03:42:17.961 --> 03:42:22.324]  Now it's easy for all of us to say, well, they should just do it anyway.
[03:42:22.324 --> 03:42:30.950]  But that getting fired and having your career end, we want them there making that money because they can fund the information operation behind the scenes.
[03:42:30.950 --> 03:42:34.092]  It's very easy for us to judge people, but I've learned I'm 39.
[03:42:34.092 --> 03:42:35.333]  When I was 19 or 20 or 25.
[03:42:38.376 --> 03:42:40.057]  I'd always call everybody a sellout.
[03:42:40.057 --> 03:42:40.938]  Oh, you're a sellout.
[03:42:40.938 --> 03:42:41.899]  You're weak.
[03:42:41.899 --> 03:42:43.660]  You just got to do the right thing and do this.
[03:42:43.660 --> 03:42:49.585]  And then as you, you know, live a little bit longer on this earth, you realize life is much more complicated than that.
[03:42:49.585 --> 03:42:52.727]  And you can't hold people to the same standards.
[03:42:52.727 --> 03:42:53.848]  For me, I'm a purist.
[03:42:53.848 --> 03:42:55.390]  I'm a true believer.
[03:42:55.390 --> 03:42:56.090]  I'm all in.
[03:42:56.090 --> 03:42:57.651]  I've been all in for years.
[03:42:57.651 --> 03:42:59.833]  There is no turning back for Mike Cernovich.
[03:42:59.833 --> 03:43:03.436]  There's no turning back for Infowars.com or Alex Jones.
[03:43:03.436 --> 03:43:06.038]  There is no, because we're not liked a lot.
[03:43:06.792 --> 03:43:08.773]  With the left, you can abuse women.
[03:43:08.773 --> 03:43:10.815]  You can fund terrorism.
[03:43:10.815 --> 03:43:14.037]  You can support threatening the president of the United States.
[03:43:14.037 --> 03:43:14.917]  And you're great.
[03:43:14.917 --> 03:43:15.918]  They'll give you a raise.
[03:43:15.918 --> 03:43:18.540]  That's actually seen as a qualification.
[03:43:18.540 --> 03:43:21.222]  But if you're on the right, once you're in, that's it.
[03:43:21.222 --> 03:43:22.542]  You're in for good.
[03:43:22.542 --> 03:43:24.964]  There is no turning back.
[03:43:24.964 --> 03:43:29.527]  Which in a lot of ways is exciting because there's complete and total freedom in that.
[03:43:29.527 --> 03:43:30.648]  There's freedom in knowing.
[03:43:31.786 --> 03:43:33.887]  For me, that I burned all the boats.
[03:43:33.887 --> 03:43:44.091]  There's an old kind of parable which said that when a naval army would cross the seas to invade a foreign land, the general upon landing would order the boats to be burned.
[03:43:44.091 --> 03:43:48.373]  They were here, there's no turning back, there is no going home.
[03:43:48.373 --> 03:43:52.175]  We're either going to conquer this land or we're going to die on this land.
[03:43:52.175 --> 03:43:54.776]  That's the way it is for us in the information battlefield.
[03:43:54.776 --> 03:43:58.757]  There is no plan B. There is no escape route.
[03:43:58.757 --> 03:44:00.258]  It is either make this happen,
[03:44:01.670 --> 03:44:03.051]  Push forward.
[03:44:03.051 --> 03:44:05.374]  Take America back from the globalists.
[03:44:05.374 --> 03:44:11.359]  Take America back from the fake news media, from the pedophiles, from the Soros types.
[03:44:11.359 --> 03:44:12.400]  Or die trying.
[03:44:12.400 --> 03:44:15.283]  And for me, I'm all in.
[03:44:15.283 --> 03:44:16.744]  Infowars.com is all in.
[03:44:16.744 --> 03:44:19.367]  And that, again, is why the support is so important for everybody.
[03:44:20.675 --> 03:44:23.276]  There is no real job for people like us.
[03:44:23.276 --> 03:44:25.677]  There is no salary, right?
[03:44:25.677 --> 03:44:28.738]  There is no big blockbuster budget.
[03:44:28.738 --> 03:44:33.280]  It's all about support from the readers, small support, all abs up.
[03:44:33.280 --> 03:44:37.062]  The millions of listeners, everybody just buys one product a month.
[03:44:37.062 --> 03:44:38.702]  The operations expand.
[03:44:38.702 --> 03:44:40.703]  There are two extended operations here.
[03:44:40.703 --> 03:44:41.364]  I took a tour.
[03:44:41.364 --> 03:44:44.145]  I actually couldn't believe it because I didn't know how big it was.
[03:44:44.145 --> 03:44:49.667]  The first time, and this is why whenever I read an article where I see why Alex doesn't let media people in,
[03:44:50.217 --> 03:44:51.178]  Alex Jones Show!
[03:44:51.178 --> 03:44:52.039]  We're good to go!
[03:44:52.039 --> 03:44:52.219]  I think?
[03:45:20.985 --> 03:45:25.586]  But they never write about how big the operations are, right?
[03:45:25.586 --> 03:45:26.206]  Think about that.
[03:45:26.206 --> 03:45:33.448]  Have you ever read an article about Alex Jones where you said, I took a tour of the Infowars studio.
[03:45:33.448 --> 03:45:36.069]  The operation was way bigger than I thought it was.
[03:45:36.069 --> 03:45:37.770]  It's super professional.
[03:45:37.770 --> 03:45:40.250]  The people he has working for him are amazing.
[03:45:40.250 --> 03:45:43.091]  You can talk about a subject and the articles are right on the screen.
[03:45:43.091 --> 03:45:44.591]  The research happens every day.
[03:45:44.591 --> 03:45:45.692]  They're working 24-7.
[03:45:45.692 --> 03:45:47.632]  They're information addicts.
[03:45:47.632 --> 03:45:49.953]  They're committed to bringing people the truth and to bring people vision.
[03:45:50.865 --> 03:45:54.167]  And Alex is just expanding the operations massively.
[03:45:54.167 --> 03:45:57.089]  You never hear that, but that's the truth.
[03:45:57.089 --> 03:46:03.793]  And that is the problem that I have with the fake news media in general is I don't mind them criticizing.
[03:46:03.793 --> 03:46:09.117]  I don't read an article where they criticize me and cry about it because I know people are going to have their own opinion.
[03:46:09.117 --> 03:46:12.239]  But if you're writing about us, then it's a fraud.
[03:46:12.239 --> 03:46:14.981]  It's fake news to not tell the whole truth.
[03:46:15.740 --> 03:46:23.065]  It's fake news to not say InfoWars is a massive operation, 65 employees, people, you know, very nice people.
[03:46:23.065 --> 03:46:27.227]  I've met so many great people, all committed to the information war.
[03:46:27.227 --> 03:46:30.349]  People have families, people have jobs.
[03:46:30.349 --> 03:46:32.330]  So Alex Jones is creating jobs for people.
[03:46:32.330 --> 03:46:39.175]  People are able to have kind of a dream job, so to speak, take care of their family, have a cool work environment.
[03:46:39.175 --> 03:46:40.395]  The operations are huge.
[03:46:40.395 --> 03:46:41.796]  They're expanding.
[03:46:41.796 --> 03:46:42.637]  You never hear that.
[03:46:43.462 --> 03:46:47.504]  Because anything that makes us look good, you're never going to read anywhere.
[03:46:47.504 --> 03:46:55.708]  But if we, you know, I don't know if there's a hot mic and I cuss somebody out or just had a bad moment, which is just normal being a human being.
[03:46:55.708 --> 03:47:00.530]  Part of being a human being is sometimes you have a bad moment, but that doesn't reflect your entire character.
[03:47:00.530 --> 03:47:05.792]  They'll take that 30 second clip and make that your whole entire life.
[03:47:05.792 --> 03:47:09.274]  But meanwhile, if you're Alec Baldwin, who abuses daughter,
[03:47:10.586 --> 03:47:12.347]  He got sued by the paparazzi.
[03:47:12.347 --> 03:47:17.409]  He labeled homophobic slurs as a paparazzi.
[03:47:17.409 --> 03:47:24.692]  I almost said, because I was thinking of the slur, which began with F, and I'm not going to say it on the air because I don't think that's the appropriate thing to say.
[03:47:24.692 --> 03:47:31.315]  But he was calling a paparazzi the F word and screaming at him, attacking him.
[03:47:31.315 --> 03:47:33.776]  He's gone on multiple tirades, stumbles around.
[03:47:34.443 --> 03:47:34.743]  Shut up!
[03:47:34.743 --> 03:47:35.383]  I said you got that!
[03:47:35.383 --> 03:47:35.583]  Shut up!
[03:48:05.450 --> 03:48:06.010]  Stay away from my wife.
[03:48:06.010 --> 03:48:06.190]  Shut up!
[03:48:06.190 --> 03:48:06.670]  Stay away from my wife.
[03:48:06.670 --> 03:48:06.890]  Shut up!
[03:48:06.890 --> 03:48:07.570]  Stay away from my wife.
[03:48:07.570 --> 03:48:07.751]  Shut up!
[03:48:07.751 --> 03:48:08.371]  Stay away from my wife.
[03:48:08.371 --> 03:48:08.871]  Shut up!
[03:48:08.871 --> 03:48:09.631]  Stay away from my wife.
[03:48:09.631 --> 03:48:10.551]  Shut up!
[03:48:10.551 --> 03:48:11.371]  Stay away from my wife.
[03:48:11.371 --> 03:48:11.771]  Shut up!
[03:48:11.771 --> 03:48:12.412]  Stay away from my wife.
[03:48:12.412 --> 03:48:12.592]  Shut up!
[03:48:12.592 --> 03:48:13.492]  Stay away from my wife.
[03:48:13.492 --> 03:48:13.712]  Shut up!
[03:48:13.712 --> 03:48:14.252]  Stay away from my wife.
[03:48:14.252 --> 03:48:14.472]  Shut up!
[03:48:14.472 --> 03:48:14.972]  Stay away from my wife.
[03:48:14.972 --> 03:48:15.232]  Shut up!
[03:48:15.232 --> 03:48:15.712]  Stay away from my wife.
[03:48:15.712 --> 03:48:15.892]  Shut up!
[03:48:15.892 --> 03:48:17.353]  Stay away from my wife.
[03:48:17.353 --> 03:48:17.593]  Shut up!
[03:48:17.593 --> 03:48:18.553]  Stay away from my wife.
[03:48:18.553 --> 03:48:18.933]  Shut up!
[03:48:18.933 --> 03:48:19.673]  Stay away from my wife.
[03:48:19.673 --> 03:48:19.993]  Shut up!
[03:48:19.993 --> 03:48:20.913]  Stay away from my wife.
[03:48:20.913 --> 03:48:21.233]  Shut up!
[03:48:21.233 --> 03:48:21.834]  Stay away from my wife.
[03:48:21.834 --> 03:48:22.014]  Shut up!
[03:48:22.014 --> 03:48:22.694]  Stay away from my wife.
[03:48:22.694 --> 03:48:22.934]  Shut up!
[03:48:22.934 --> 03:48:24.894]  Stay away from my wife.
[03:48:24.894 --> 03:48:25.154]  Shut up!
[03:48:25.154 --> 03:48:26.095]  Stay away from my wife.
[03:48:26.095 --> 03:48:26.415]  Shut up!
[03:48:26.415 --> 03:48:27.175]  Stay away from my wife.
[03:48:27.175 --> 03:48:27.535]  Shut up!
[03:48:27.535 --> 03:48:28.395]  Stay away from my wife.
[03:48:28.395 --> 03:48:28.695]  Shut up!
[03:48:28.695 --> 03:48:29.655]  Stay away from my wife.
[03:48:29.655 --> 03:48:29.875]  Shut up!
[03:48:29.875 --> 03:48:30.476]  Stay away from my wife.
[03:48:30.476 --> 03:48:30.796]  Shut up!
[03:48:30.796 --> 03:48:31.556]  Stay away from my wife.
[03:48:31.556 --> 03:48:31.836]  Shut up!
[03:48:31.836 --> 03:48:32.556]  Stay away from my wife.
[03:48:32.556 --> 03:48:32.756]  Shut up
[03:48:33.271 --> 03:48:42.396]  They don't, there's that like parenthetical game I call it where so whenever they mention me they'll say Mike Cernovich, a right-wing blogger who spreads conspiracy theories.
[03:48:42.396 --> 03:48:44.157]  They can't just say Mike Cernovich.
[03:48:44.157 --> 03:48:49.080]  They have to throw in some line trying to insult me and shame me.
[03:48:49.080 --> 03:48:54.403]  Well why don't they say Alec Baldwin who emotionally abuses underage girls?
[03:48:54.403 --> 03:49:00.386]  Alec Baldwin who is called abusive Alec by the internet because he has such an anger management problem.
[03:49:01.328 --> 03:49:02.348]  You never read that, right?
[03:49:02.348 --> 03:49:11.090]  So if you read the New York Times, which I hope you never do read those sites, just occasionally, I guess, I have to stay informed about what they're lying about.
[03:49:11.090 --> 03:49:22.032]  But if my job were not to expose fake news media, if my job weren't to hold the fake news media accountable, I would never even read that stuff because it's all lies and I would rather read good fiction.
[03:49:22.032 --> 03:49:24.593]  I'd rather read, you know, Tom Wolfe's Bonfire of the Vandals.
[03:49:24.593 --> 03:49:26.193]  There's so many great fiction.
[03:49:26.193 --> 03:49:27.474]  Catch 22.
[03:49:27.474 --> 03:49:29.334]  There's so many great fiction books out there.
[03:49:29.878 --> 03:49:38.426]  That if I'm going to read fiction, why read high school tier level copy from WAPO, which is owned by Jeff Bezos.
[03:49:38.426 --> 03:49:44.992]  The New York Times, which is owned by Carlos Slim, a Mexican oligarch who makes a ton of money by illegal immigration.
[03:49:44.992 --> 03:49:48.455]  Media Matters, which is owned by George Soros and David Brock.
[03:49:48.455 --> 03:49:54.421]  Why would I read their crap tier fiction when I could read great works of fiction?
[03:49:55.168 --> 03:49:56.089]  But it's my job.
[03:49:56.089 --> 03:49:57.171]  That's the only reason.
[03:49:57.171 --> 03:50:03.220]  I'm just telling you that, you know, I feel sorry if you read this kind of stuff for pleasure, because all of this is lies.
[03:50:03.220 --> 03:50:05.423]  Comey even called the New York Times a liar.
[03:50:05.423 --> 03:50:10.931]  James Comey called the New York Times fake news, which is amazing because
[03:50:12.006 --> 03:50:18.130]  As somebody who doesn't think highly of Comey, I was still surprised that he called the New York Times fake news.
[03:50:18.130 --> 03:50:20.992]  So imagine how much of that comes out which is fake.
[03:50:20.992 --> 03:50:24.894]  But that's what a lot of people... So maybe we'll devote that to... We'll do that for the next segment.
[03:50:24.894 --> 03:50:31.218]  So before the next segment, we're going to talk about fake news, sourcing, journalism, how crappy the media is.

[03:50:46.988 --> 03:50:51.050]  I don't use fluoride toothpaste either because that stuff is terrible for your brain.
[03:50:51.050 --> 03:50:53.552]  I use Super Blue toothpaste.
[03:50:53.552 --> 03:50:55.073]  That's what everybody needs to get.

[03:53:56.846 --> 03:53:57.587]  Effective.
[03:54:19.059 --> 03:54:22.602]  That are wrong in our country and why it's so important to fund the info work.
[03:54:22.602 --> 03:54:38.813]  So there was an article, it was a tweet actually that CNN posted before James Comey testimony and they go, sources tell us, CNN, Jake Taper, they go, sources tell us that James Comey is going to testify that Trump was under investigation.
[03:54:38.813 --> 03:54:39.914]  Sources.
[03:54:39.914 --> 03:54:40.895]  That was the big story.
[03:54:42.093 --> 03:54:51.982]  Well, as we all know, and I think we have the article getting ready, so they had to change the title of the article after we humiliated them on Twitter, Correction Update.
[03:54:51.982 --> 03:54:59.788]  So the original tweet, yeah, so the original tweet had said that Comey was going to testify
[03:55:01.047 --> 03:55:04.228]  That Trump was under investigation.
[03:55:04.228 --> 03:55:05.329]  So it's all fake.
[03:55:05.329 --> 03:55:06.429]  That's the whole thing.
[03:55:06.429 --> 03:55:07.850]  This is what they do.
[03:55:07.850 --> 03:55:08.930]  Oh, sources told me.
[03:55:08.930 --> 03:55:17.634]  So let me tell you a little bit about the sources the fake news media had, because remember, James Comey testified under oath that the New York Times is fake news.
[03:55:17.634 --> 03:55:18.294]  Think about that.
[03:55:18.294 --> 03:55:20.195]  Let me talk about a headline.
[03:55:20.195 --> 03:55:25.377]  James Comey testifies under oath that the New York Times is fake news.
[03:55:25.377 --> 03:55:26.758]  This is the world we live in.
[03:55:26.758 --> 03:55:27.598]  That really happened.
[03:55:29.386 --> 03:55:37.152]  Remember, there was a February article that came out in the New York Times, which claimed that there was a major investigation about Russia and Trump.
[03:55:37.152 --> 03:55:39.914]  James Comey said the article was wrong.
[03:55:39.914 --> 03:55:42.576]  It was complete nonsense, under oath.
[03:55:42.576 --> 03:55:47.600]  So James Comey went under oath and testified that the New York Times is fake news.
[03:55:47.600 --> 03:55:49.362]  Their articles are fake.
[03:55:49.362 --> 03:55:54.686]  CNN claims sources are telling them that James Comey is going to testify that Trump was under investigation.
[03:55:55.808 --> 03:56:00.671]  And of course, as we know, Trump was not under investigation.
[03:56:00.671 --> 03:56:03.552]  Comey even said Trump wasn't under investigation.
[03:56:03.552 --> 03:56:06.714]  Which brings us to another more interesting point.
[03:56:06.714 --> 03:56:08.535]  Marco Rubio.
[03:56:08.535 --> 03:56:12.758]  We've been hard on Marco Rubio, but you know what?
[03:56:12.758 --> 03:56:13.838]  We're real journalism.
[03:56:13.838 --> 03:56:16.500]  Infowars.com is real journalism.
[03:56:16.500 --> 03:56:18.901]  Mike Cernovich, real journalism.
[03:56:18.901 --> 03:56:21.683]  So when Rubio does great work, you know what you do as a real journalist?
[03:56:22.495 --> 03:56:28.681]  You say I might have my problems with Rubio, but Rubio killed the game, murdered the game.
[03:56:28.681 --> 03:56:31.824]  Talk about the all-star of the day, the MVP.
[03:56:31.824 --> 03:56:33.805]  Marco Rubio, MVP.
[03:56:33.805 --> 03:56:36.908]  And he made such a poignant point that I didn't even think about it.
[03:56:36.908 --> 03:56:43.935]  He was so good, his game was so high and so hot, that I was like, wow, I didn't even think to make that point.
[03:56:43.935 --> 03:56:46.097]  That was how good he was, the MVP of the day.
[03:56:46.977 --> 03:56:54.706]  And he said, isn't it interesting that everything that is getting leaked to the media, except that Trump was not personally under investigation by Russia?
[03:56:55.797 --> 03:57:00.139]  What a just nuclear, a tactical nuke at the fake news media, right?
[03:57:00.139 --> 03:57:04.682]  You know, we have a Cuban missile crisis with Castro, you know, coming close to Florida.
[03:57:04.682 --> 03:57:10.785]  You know, Marco Rubio, that was just a nuclear missile strike right there at the fake news media.
[03:57:10.785 --> 03:57:15.547]  That is interesting that, why is it that we have all these leaks about investigations?
[03:57:15.547 --> 03:57:21.570]  And as James Comey testified and wrote, that leak to the New York Times in that February article was actually a fake leak.
[03:57:21.977 --> 03:57:23.978]  It was a fake news, manufacturing story.
[03:57:23.978 --> 03:57:25.198]  It's not true.
[03:57:25.198 --> 03:57:36.361]  As that CNN headline, which they initially tweeted that Comey's going to testify that Trump was personally under investigation, what James Comey unrode said, the CNN is fake news.
[03:57:36.361 --> 03:57:37.382]  Right?
[03:57:37.382 --> 03:57:40.743]  So we got all these leaks going out there that are fake.
[03:57:40.743 --> 03:57:44.304]  When the truth is that Trump was never under investigation from Russia.
[03:57:45.216 --> 03:57:47.837]  So who is actually leaking this information?
[03:57:47.837 --> 03:57:52.759]  Do they have any real sources in the New York Times or the Washington Post or CNN?
[03:57:52.759 --> 03:57:55.180]  No, here's the source to them.
[03:57:55.180 --> 03:57:58.301]  They could go know a friend who's a lobbyist.
[03:57:58.301 --> 03:57:59.982]  That's why they don't name the source.
[03:57:59.982 --> 03:58:03.503]  They could have a person who is a lobbyist working for Obama.
[03:58:04.335 --> 03:58:05.595]  And you know what they'll do?
[03:58:05.595 --> 03:58:08.756]  That person will say, oh yeah, Trump is under investigation.
[03:58:08.756 --> 03:58:16.938]  And then when you don't name the guy and you keep him anonymous, they go, anonymous source with personal knowledge of the FBI said this.
[03:58:16.938 --> 03:58:18.198]  It is all fake.
[03:58:18.198 --> 03:58:19.358]  It is fake news.
[03:58:19.358 --> 03:58:22.159]  James Comey under oath proved that CNN is fake news.
[03:58:22.159 --> 03:58:25.020]  James Comey under oath said New York Times is fake news.
[03:58:25.020 --> 03:58:26.000]  But you know what real news is?
[03:58:26.906 --> 03:58:31.350]  InfoWars.com, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWife.com.
[03:58:31.350 --> 03:58:32.931]  You are listening to the Real News.
[03:58:32.931 --> 03:58:34.472]  You're watching the Real News.
[03:58:34.472 --> 03:58:36.074]  Mike Cernovich, thank you for the support.
