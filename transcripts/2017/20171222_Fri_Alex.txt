[00:00:02.981 --> 00:00:06.702]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have got gigantic news to break down today.
[00:00:06.702 --> 00:00:08.363]  An absolute must-watch.
[00:00:08.363 --> 00:00:10.323]  Let's go ahead and go to this John Bowne report first.
[00:00:10.323 --> 00:00:11.403]  It's very important.
[00:00:11.403 --> 00:00:14.164]  This is going to mean companies are going to be coming back.
[00:00:14.164 --> 00:00:18.025]  You know, I campaigned on the fact that we're not going to lose our companies anymore.
[00:00:18.025 --> 00:00:20.466]  They're going to stay in our country.
[00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:21.926]  And they're going to stay in our country.
[00:00:21.926 --> 00:00:24.687]  And you've been seeing what's been happening even at this prospect.
[00:00:25.327 --> 00:00:37.336]  But they have tremendous enthusiasm right now in this country, and we have companies pouring back into our country, and that means jobs, and it means really the formation of new, young, beautiful, strong companies.
[00:00:37.336 --> 00:00:40.058]  So that's going to be very, very important.
[00:00:40.058 --> 00:00:44.362]  The pass-throughs you know all about, and the small businesses are going to be big beneficiaries.
[00:00:44.962 --> 00:00:55.869]  We are going to bring at least four trillion dollars back into this country, money that was frozen overseas and in parts and worlds and some of them don't even like us and they had the money.
[00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:58.170]  Well, they're not going to have the money long.
[00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.014]  And so it's really... I guess it's very simple.
[00:01:04.014 --> 00:01:04.554]  What do you think?
[00:01:04.554 --> 00:01:11.378]  You haven't heard this expression, but we are making America great again.
[00:01:11.378 --> 00:01:12.379]  You haven't heard that, have you?
[00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:34.485]  On one hand, the Democrats, whose policies of expanding welfare, adding $10 billion to our national debt, and a disastrous unconstitutional Obamacare disruption, pleaded with the American people that they have become increasingly detached from to believe their doomsday scenario regarding the passing of the Republican tax reform bill.
[00:01:34.485 --> 00:01:43.031]  Republicans head to the White House for their back-slapping and high-fives to celebrate passage of a bill against the will of the American people.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.842]  We have a simple message for our Republican friends.
[00:01:46.842 --> 00:01:51.584]  Republicans will rue the day they pass this bill.
[00:01:51.584 --> 00:01:55.866]  And you can bet Democrats will make sure of that.
[00:01:55.866 --> 00:02:02.409]  We are going to continue to hammer away at why this bill is so unpopular.
[00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.732]  At why what the Republican rhetoric and the reality is so far apart.
[00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:19.588]  Today's passage of the partisan tax bill officially cements the Republican Party as the party of the wealthy corporations against the middle class.
[00:02:20.666 --> 00:02:22.747]  And the working people of this country.
[00:02:22.747 --> 00:02:30.969]  On the other hand, Republicans defended the intentions of the bill and endured Democratic talking points from media prostitutes.
[00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:35.750]  To bring relief to the American families and Nevada families just across this nation.
[00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:47.414]  The fact that we're able to create jobs, increase pay wages, and also make sure that our businesses are competitive around this nation makes this a very, very important day.
[00:02:48.286 --> 00:03:00.614]  What do you say to Senator Schumer, though, who says that you guys are going to rue the day that you passed this bill, that the politics of passing long-term corporate tax cuts but short-term individual cuts is going to catch up to you guys?
[00:03:19.042 --> 00:03:24.583]  Provide business changes that make us more competitive.
[00:03:24.583 --> 00:03:28.884]  With regard to the termination dates, let me tell you what terminates this tax cut.
[00:03:28.884 --> 00:03:40.547]  The Democrats taking the Congress next November would turn this into a very short tax bill.
[00:03:40.547 --> 00:03:46.888]  So I think focusing on dates that may expire because of the need to fit the reconciliation rules
[00:03:47.956 --> 00:03:49.358]  I missed the point.
[00:03:49.358 --> 00:03:50.941]  Every single Democrat voted for this.
[00:03:50.941 --> 00:03:54.766]  They're all committed to repealing it and raising taxes on the American people.
[00:03:54.766 --> 00:03:55.708]  That's what's at stake.
[00:03:56.517 --> 00:03:58.058]  In the fall of 2018.
[00:03:58.058 --> 00:04:00.839]  All in all, the proof will be in the pudding.
[00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:21.827]  After Trump did in his first year what Obama couldn't do in eight, rallying the American economy to 3% GDP growth, before the bill was even signed by the president, Wells Fargo and Fifth Third Bank have called for a raise in the minimum wage of their employees, while AT&T and Comcast are giving hundreds of thousands of their employees $1,000 bonuses.
[00:04:23.328 --> 00:04:37.462]  And when the economic boom continues as a result of this tax reform, maybe it's time that we consider scrapping the Democratic Party, a party that has become nothing more than a bulwark against true American progress.
[00:04:37.462 --> 00:04:40.284]  John Bowne reporting for InfoWars.com
[00:04:41.265 --> 00:04:42.867]  100% on target.
[00:04:42.867 --> 00:04:43.848]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:43.848 --> 00:04:47.713]  The main transmission begins in T-minus 60 seconds.
[00:04:47.713 --> 00:04:52.718]  Please spread the word about your local station and the video and audio feeds that you're watching right now.
[00:04:52.718 --> 00:04:56.502]  That's how we reach new people and win the war.
[00:04:56.502 --> 00:04:58.404]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:04:58.404 --> 00:04:58.705]  Go ahead.
[00:04:59.626 --> 00:05:01.568]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[00:05:01.568 --> 00:05:10.937]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[00:05:12.073 --> 00:05:18.518]  And as a long-time InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[00:05:18.518 --> 00:05:20.779]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:21.840]  Thank you.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.342]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[00:05:24.342 --> 00:05:28.645]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[00:05:28.645 --> 00:05:31.667]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[00:05:31.667 --> 00:05:32.987]  They are quality.
[00:05:32.987 --> 00:05:34.709]  I can't wait to get some more.
[00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:37.611]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[00:05:37.611 --> 00:05:38.131]  Absolutely.
[00:05:38.652 --> 00:05:51.572]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[00:06:23.311 --> 00:06:29.807]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:29.807 --> 00:06:32.795]  What we are looking at, good and evil.
[00:06:49.486 --> 00:06:51.786]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[00:06:51.786 --> 00:07:00.328]  We're broadcasting worldwide on this Friday, already the 22nd day of December 2017.
[00:07:00.328 --> 00:07:03.849]  The year is almost over.
[00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:10.030]  I intend to open the phones up today, and I intend to cover all the really huge breaking news.
[00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:16.051]  We're going to have Lieutenant Colonel Matt Smithmech popping back in for part of the next hour to discuss
[00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:34.836]  The big news about Obama protecting Hezbollah and allowing them to deal drugs inside the United States and procure weapons inside the United States to then transfer them from Mexico down into Central and South America and then tranship into the Middle East.
[00:07:34.836 --> 00:07:43.463]  So it's beyond Reagan's Iran-Contra, where some elements of the CIA allowed cocaine to come in the United States to finance taking out communists.
[00:07:44.187 --> 00:07:48.290]  And the Sandinistas, which is bad enough in my book, shouldn't be done.
[00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:54.654]  This is letting Islamists do it, and Iran do it, to go topple governments in the Middle East.
[00:07:54.654 --> 00:07:58.136]  So, just next level stuff.
[00:07:58.136 --> 00:08:01.518]  And that is all coming out now.
[00:08:01.518 --> 00:08:06.441]  And Matt Smith-Mack was here over a year ago, March of last year, breaking it down, so he's gonna be popping in.
[00:08:06.441 --> 00:08:09.143]  We're gonna have open phones throughout the transmission.
[00:08:09.143 --> 00:08:11.825]  You know, Eric Schmidt is out at Google,
[00:08:13.636 --> 00:08:15.517]  As the head of it, he's still part owner of it.
[00:08:15.517 --> 00:08:16.817]  And they're saying, oh, why is that?
[00:08:16.817 --> 00:08:21.139]  You know, all the women he loads on his jumbo jet, reportedly up to 15 at a time.
[00:08:21.139 --> 00:08:22.980]  That's no crime right there.
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.200]  No, the issue is, is that he's a globalist.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.421]  He's been anti-Trump the whole time.
[00:08:27.421 --> 00:08:31.103]  And Google is about to get broken up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:31.103 --> 00:08:39.786]  The new head of the Securities Exchange Commission has been very, very weary of Google for years before he was put in as the head of it.
[00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:42.150]  By President Trump a few months ago.
[00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:52.519]  And all the stars are aligning to break up these groups that are anti-free market, anti-free speech, and have been censoring massively.
[00:08:52.519 --> 00:09:00.125]  And they've been caught censoring massively, they've been caught working with authoritarian regimes, Facebook, Twitter, Google, you name it.
[00:09:00.125 --> 00:09:02.988]  And all the chickens are now coming home to roost.
[00:09:02.988 --> 00:09:07.772]  So you get next month's news today, next year's news today, always tomorrow's news today.
[00:09:08.703 --> 00:09:12.745]  Here at Infowars, there's lots of speculation about why is that happening?
[00:09:12.745 --> 00:09:18.247]  Well, it's happening because Google basically controlled the Obama government.
[00:09:18.247 --> 00:09:24.209]  And they have been arrogantly trying to steamroll the President.
[00:09:24.209 --> 00:09:30.232]  They have been fighting with everything they've got.
[00:09:30.232 --> 00:09:33.313]  And now, they have been caught
[00:09:34.346 --> 00:09:35.447]  In a big, big way.
[00:09:35.447 --> 00:09:40.330]  So, all of that is going to be unfolding, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:52.237]  Also, we've got reports here out of the New York Times, and this is really the big news, New York Times column says Trump is about the stage of coup.
[00:09:52.237 --> 00:10:01.762]  Now, Trump was elected, Trump passed a tax bill, Trump killed the TPP that the President could do, because that was done through executive power, it was unconstitutional, he could kill it.
[00:10:01.762 --> 00:10:02.903]  Everything he's done
[00:10:03.866 --> 00:10:06.288]  Has been within the Constitution.
[00:10:06.288 --> 00:10:12.313]  Federal courts said he couldn't block people from unvetted nations.
[00:10:12.313 --> 00:10:18.638]  But then, ladies and gentlemen, what happened?
[00:10:18.638 --> 00:10:19.999]  What unfolded?
[00:10:19.999 --> 00:10:22.621]  The Supreme Court said 9-0 he could.
[00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:24.543]  So everything he's done has been constitutional.
[00:10:24.543 --> 00:10:27.025]  They're the ones trying to overthrow the President.
[00:10:28.183 --> 00:10:34.464]  They're the ones openly saying that they are going to try to kill it on a daily basis.
[00:10:34.464 --> 00:10:41.025]  They're the ones saying they want a civil war and to resist and to overthrow things.
[00:10:41.025 --> 00:10:44.446]  And then every time we point that out, they go, Oh, Alex Jones is crazy.
[00:10:44.446 --> 00:10:45.186]  That's not happening.
[00:10:45.186 --> 00:10:46.707]  Well, here it is.
[00:10:46.707 --> 00:10:48.927]  New York Times column says Trump is about to stage a coup.
[00:10:48.927 --> 00:10:50.187]  We're going to get to that.
[00:10:50.187 --> 00:10:52.908]  Then there's this little jewel on Infowars.com.
[00:10:52.908 --> 00:10:54.208]  Former Obama advisor,
[00:10:54.952 --> 00:11:01.277]  And White House press briefer calls for death of GOP leadership on Twitter.
[00:11:01.277 --> 00:11:11.606]  Congressman Scalise sent him a tweet back and said you really should reassess what you're saying and what you're doing.
[00:11:11.606 --> 00:11:13.347]  This is very, very dangerous.
[00:11:13.347 --> 00:11:16.970]  Meanwhile, Media Matters takes our tongue-in-cheek piece we did at the shooting range.
[00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:22.815]  Roderick Stone and I, Alex Jones and Roderick Stone visited the gun range to prepare for civil war if Trump is removed from office.
[00:11:23.854 --> 00:11:27.136]  And of course, we're just pointing out that they're the ones calling for violence, for the overthrow.
[00:11:27.136 --> 00:11:29.198]  All we're saying is we will defend ourselves.
[00:11:29.198 --> 00:11:35.222]  They try to spin that, that it's a call for violence, as they always do.
[00:11:35.222 --> 00:11:38.145]  So, that is going to be coming up here.
[00:11:38.145 --> 00:11:45.170]  But every day, another Obama administration official, another organization, another group,
[00:11:46.357 --> 00:11:52.579]  Comes out and says, we want to kill the Republicans, we want to kill the President, we want to get Alex Jones, we want to do all of this.
[00:11:52.579 --> 00:12:03.503]  And when we sit there and point out that it's wrong, when we point out that it's them trying to stop our democratic process, they go, we're not saying that, we're not doing that.
[00:12:03.503 --> 00:12:14.507]  But now, as they get more and more and more and more hysterical, they're getting more dangerous by the minute.
[00:12:14.507 --> 00:12:15.767]  So we've all got to ask ourselves,
[00:12:16.494 --> 00:12:19.696]  What is going to be coming out of this here in the near future?
[00:12:19.696 --> 00:12:21.077]  That's a big, big question.
[00:12:21.077 --> 00:12:21.637]  But you know what?
[00:12:21.637 --> 00:12:29.102]  I want to go ahead and get into a very, very important area here.
[00:12:29.102 --> 00:12:45.633]  This clip from Congressman Jim Jordan and how the media is spinning all of this and spinning everything, saying that he's got talking points and that Republicans are getting talking points from Trump when they talk about the emails and the text messages and everything.
[00:12:47.205 --> 00:13:01.551]  That's where the Democrats, the FBI, the Justice Department people, the Deputy Director at the time, McCabe, are meeting trying to fix the information and make it up and have the insurance policy.
[00:13:01.551 --> 00:13:04.253]  Those aren't talking points, those are the facts.
[00:13:04.253 --> 00:13:10.716]  If you dig a dead body up in somebody's backyard and catch them killing other people and it goes to trial, it's not a talking point, it's evidence.
[00:13:10.716 --> 00:13:15.938]  If you catch your kid with their hand in the cookie jar, it's not talking points, it's catching them red-handed.
[00:13:16.519 --> 00:13:20.786]  If you catch a guy in bed with your wife, it's not talking points, it's prima facie.
[00:13:20.786 --> 00:13:22.749]  It's on its face.
[00:13:22.749 --> 00:13:24.072]  So here he is talking about it.
[00:13:24.072 --> 00:13:27.217]  I haven't talked to the White House about talking points in Mueller investigation.
[00:13:27.217 --> 00:13:27.597]  Here's CNN.
[00:13:28.487 --> 00:13:35.391]  Have you had conversations, or has your office had conversations, with the White House about the Mueller investigation?
[00:13:35.391 --> 00:13:36.191]  I have not called them.
[00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:39.753]  Like, we just had Mr. Sessions, Mr. Rosenstein, Mr. Rainforest.
[00:13:39.753 --> 00:13:42.334]  I did not talk to the White House about what kind of questions I was going to ask.
[00:13:42.334 --> 00:13:44.975]  I based it on the evidence and the facts that have come out.
[00:13:44.975 --> 00:13:48.217]  Like, I just, I mean, how do you, how do you get around the text message?
[00:13:48.217 --> 00:13:54.280]  Have you had, have you had conversations with the White House, not about the questions you asked, but about the Mueller investigation in general?
[00:13:55.271 --> 00:13:57.952]  Well, I've talked with the White House about all kinds of things.
[00:13:57.952 --> 00:13:59.673]  We've had talks with the White House about tax policy.
[00:13:59.673 --> 00:14:01.194]  We've had talks about welfare policy.
[00:14:01.194 --> 00:14:02.654]  We've had talks about Obamacare.
[00:14:02.654 --> 00:14:04.615]  Of course, we've had talks with the White House.
[00:14:04.615 --> 00:14:17.982]  But my questions in those committees was driven by the evidence we've received in the last several weeks, like the text message from Peter Strzok on a recent page says where we can't afford to take the risk that the American people are going to elect Donald Trump, so we need an insurance policy.
[00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:18.802]  If that doesn't go to
[00:14:18.882 --> 00:14:19.202]  I don't
[00:14:34.363 --> 00:14:36.704]  Of course not, of course not.
[00:14:36.704 --> 00:14:38.184]  But here's the coordination.
[00:14:38.184 --> 00:14:54.210]  The Clinton campaign and the DNC, now we know those are one and the same, paid the law firm, who paid Fusion GPS, who paid Christopher Steele, who paid Russians to give him this dossier, get this dossier that was, we think, taken to the FISA court and was the basis for securing warrants to spy on Americans.
[00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:58.131]  If you let me, I will get to this.
[00:14:58.131 --> 00:15:01.332]  I will get to the dossier and the FBI.
[00:15:01.332 --> 00:15:03.933]  Your charges are on the FBI in just a second, but I want to finish up on the
[00:15:04.013 --> 00:15:04.694]  Those aren't charges.
[00:15:04.694 --> 00:15:05.474]  Those are facts.
[00:15:05.474 --> 00:15:06.555]  I want to get to the issue.
[00:15:06.555 --> 00:15:08.337]  I want to stay on the issue of coordination for one second.
[00:15:08.337 --> 00:15:10.278]  I want to talk about the coordination we know.
[00:15:10.278 --> 00:15:11.059]  Here's the coordination we know.
[00:15:11.059 --> 00:15:12.000]  Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.485]  You've been on Fox News when you say that the FBI was acting to keep Donald Trump from being President of the United States.
[00:15:18.485 --> 00:15:21.587]  Before you go on Fox News, do you talk to them?
[00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:24.650]  Do you talk to them about these claims that you will make?
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:34.563]  I talk to my colleagues, I look at the evidence, and I talk with our press people who book us on your show, and we talk about the coordination that exists between the Clinton campaign and the Russians.
[00:15:34.563 --> 00:15:35.424]  Now think about this.
[00:15:35.424 --> 00:15:39.225]  We know for a fact the Clinton campaign paid Russians to do what?
[00:15:39.225 --> 00:15:40.625]  To influence the election.
[00:15:40.625 --> 00:15:50.929]  And yet we've had this month-long investigation by Bob Mueller with no evidence that President Trump worked with Russians in any way to coordinate the election.
[00:15:50.929 --> 00:15:54.090]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, but that's how they try to change the subject.
[00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:54.450]  Stay with us.
[00:15:55.626 --> 00:15:57.508]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[00:15:57.508 --> 00:16:00.730]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.332]  Savory and delicious.
[00:16:02.332 --> 00:16:05.174]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[00:16:05.174 --> 00:16:05.834]  Awesome.
[00:16:05.834 --> 00:16:08.937]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.
[00:16:08.937 --> 00:16:10.498]  NASA PAC Technology.
[00:16:10.498 --> 00:16:11.099]  Bacon.
[00:16:11.099 --> 00:16:15.262]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready-to-eat right from the pack bacon.
[00:16:15.262 --> 00:16:16.703]  Or warm and served.
[00:16:16.703 --> 00:16:18.745]  Life-saving, ready-to-eat bacon.
[00:16:18.745 --> 00:16:20.706]  10-year shelf life bacon.

[00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:28.031]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[00:16:28.031 --> 00:16:29.051]  That's true.
[00:16:29.051 --> 00:16:34.113]  But did you know you can have tax-free access to your life insurance while you're still alive?
[00:16:34.113 --> 00:16:39.315]  You can use the life benefits of your life insurance to grow your money with certainty and guarantees.
[00:16:39.315 --> 00:16:43.516]  No stock market risk, no tax risk, and no penalties.

[00:18:05.574 --> 00:18:13.663]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of Southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:18:13.963 --> 00:18:18.825]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:18:39.833 --> 00:18:42.654]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I'd

[00:19:59.574 --> 00:20:02.237]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:09.108 --> 00:20:16.092]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[00:20:16.092 --> 00:20:21.135]  Let me give you an idea of some of what's coming up.
[00:20:21.135 --> 00:20:25.938]  Remember Camille Paglia wrote earlier this year that transgender
[00:20:38.672 --> 00:20:49.058]  Propagandists are committing child abuse when they go into children three, four, five, six, seven years old and tell them, well, you may not really be a girl, you may not really be a boy, you may be something else.
[00:20:49.058 --> 00:20:57.644]  And then now they're going to push gear in the schools on the children where little girls will wear fake genitals.
[00:20:57.644 --> 00:21:02.287]  And I'm going to get into that and who's pushing it and what's happening coming up.
[00:21:02.287 --> 00:21:03.307]  Wait until you see this.
[00:21:03.307 --> 00:21:05.909]  You cannot make this up.
[00:21:06.707 --> 00:21:10.128]  And they talk about, we've got the gear for your children.
[00:21:10.128 --> 00:21:11.949]  I mean, I don't even really know what that means.
[00:21:11.949 --> 00:21:12.669]  I had to look it up.
[00:21:12.669 --> 00:21:15.310]  That's all fetishized stuff.
[00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:19.211]  I mean, I just, it's a sexualization of children has gone into mock speed.
[00:21:19.211 --> 00:21:19.912]  That's coming up.
[00:21:19.912 --> 00:21:24.493]  Also Facebook, we've talked about this, but it's back in the news and they're getting a lot of trouble for it now.
[00:21:24.493 --> 00:21:28.035]  Facebook team helping regimes that fight their opposition.
[00:21:28.035 --> 00:21:31.616]  Even Bloomberg admits that, but they're doing the same thing here.
[00:21:31.616 --> 00:21:31.996]  And then it,
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:37.963]  Ties into Apple being caught slowing down and killing old phones.
[00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:38.944]  They're being sued for that.
[00:21:38.944 --> 00:21:40.065]  We knew that was happening.
[00:21:40.065 --> 00:21:44.568]  And surveillance cams, face scans help China make thousands vanish.
[00:21:44.568 --> 00:21:47.029]  Gets into all the incredible oppression in China.
[00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:50.572]  How they're using social network digital scores to control everybody.
[00:21:50.572 --> 00:21:51.792]  AP exclusive.
[00:21:51.792 --> 00:21:54.934]  Digital police state shackles Chinese minority.
[00:21:54.934 --> 00:21:57.336]  But that's what the Washington Post is calling for.
[00:21:57.336 --> 00:21:58.637]  Censorship here of yours truly.
[00:21:59.494 --> 00:22:09.698]  So the very programs developed and refined in China of digital oppression are coming here, and the very people bringing it here out of the other side of their mouth are criticizing China.
[00:22:09.698 --> 00:22:11.319]  This is a big deal.
[00:22:11.319 --> 00:22:21.743]  And in many cases, working with China, working with Pakistan, working with others to literally have them arrested for being Christian and disappeared, or for being Buddhist.
[00:22:21.743 --> 00:22:23.984]  And these sites are more than willing to do it.
[00:22:23.984 --> 00:22:27.025]  They're extreme authoritarians with a fake liberal covering.
[00:22:28.266 --> 00:22:29.367]  That's how they get away with it.
[00:22:29.367 --> 00:22:33.250]  And, of course, you see all of that hypocrisy now coming out.
[00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:38.375]  But before I go to break and come back with the big news, they're clearly pushing a civil war.
[00:22:38.375 --> 00:22:41.517]  They're clearly pushing an attempt to have a coup against the president.
[00:22:41.517 --> 00:22:53.507]  We have more Obama administration officials and others calling for it today and yesterday and then saying that Trump is about to stage a coup when everything he's done has been constitutional.
[00:22:53.507 --> 00:22:55.449]  The real coup plot
[00:22:56.653 --> 00:23:00.475]  Is Trump's, is the ridiculous article from the New York Times.
[00:23:00.475 --> 00:23:02.696]  So that's all coming up.
[00:23:02.696 --> 00:23:06.898]  See, we warned of this, we're crazy, it doesn't exist, but they're the ones actually calling for it.
[00:23:06.898 --> 00:23:16.243]  But then, when Trump's doing nothing but restoring the republic, they call that a coup, because it's a counter coup against the globalist takeover of the country.
[00:23:16.243 --> 00:23:18.364]  But notice, securing the borders more.
[00:23:18.999 --> 00:23:24.562]  Deploying more sovereignty to our Constitution, to our Republic.
[00:23:24.562 --> 00:23:25.822]  Empowering that in the courts.
[00:23:25.822 --> 00:23:28.283]  Getting a good Supreme Court Justice appointed.
[00:23:28.283 --> 00:23:31.525]  Getting other good federal judges appointed.
[00:23:31.525 --> 00:23:33.806]  Getting the big tax cuts passed.
[00:23:33.806 --> 00:23:35.126]  Getting the stock market way up.
[00:23:35.126 --> 00:23:38.088]  Getting record new hiring and jobs.
[00:23:38.088 --> 00:23:42.630]  Total, over-the-top, incredible, miraculous in the first year.
[00:23:45.445 --> 00:23:54.297]  Meanwhile, mainstream media grudgingly has to admit the incredible benefits of this for working class and middle class taxpayers.
[00:23:54.297 --> 00:23:58.322]  That only panics the establishment more as their Mueller investigation falls apart.
[00:23:58.322 --> 00:23:59.564]  So again, they say Trump
[00:24:00.214 --> 00:24:00.874]  We're good to go.
[00:24:19.199 --> 00:24:22.520]  The President, never passed by Congress, but just implemented by Fiat.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.521]  Trump is pulling us out of all that.
[00:24:24.521 --> 00:24:32.124]  So they see that as a coup because he's chopping off all the globalist tentacles that had almost completely destroyed this nation.
[00:24:32.124 --> 00:24:38.246]  You're seeing a miraculous turnaround as soon as the poison of globalism isn't being injected into our veins.
[00:24:38.246 --> 00:24:45.449]  Here's a few minutes of the President, just an hour and a half ago, signing the historic tax bill that passed a few days ago.
[00:24:45.449 --> 00:24:45.789]  Here it is.
[00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:50.592]  We are going to sign some very important things today.
[00:24:50.592 --> 00:25:06.102]  One is a continuing resolution that very importantly gives us the right and we are ordering four billion dollars worth of missile defense equipment and missiles themselves.
[00:25:06.102 --> 00:25:07.162]  Very important.
[00:25:07.162 --> 00:25:08.363]  Top of the line.
[00:25:08.363 --> 00:25:09.244]  Best in the world.
[00:25:09.244 --> 00:25:11.745]  We make the best military product in the world.
[00:25:11.745 --> 00:25:12.866]  Nobody is even close.
[00:25:14.093 --> 00:25:32.923]  So we're ordering four billion dollars worth of missile defense and that will be done by signing right here and also by notifying the Speaker of the House and President of the Senate designating the missile defense as an emergency defense fund.
[00:25:32.923 --> 00:25:37.165]  So it's four billion dollars for that and seven hundred
[00:25:37.919 --> 00:25:43.744]  Million dollars for various other military forms of equipment and I'm very honored to be doing that.
[00:25:43.744 --> 00:25:50.710]  Our military has been doing a fantastic job in so many ways with ISIS and everything they're touching lately has been working out.
[00:25:50.710 --> 00:26:03.140]  So we're signing that.
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.662]  This is the letter.
[00:26:07.316 --> 00:26:29.173]  To Mitch McConnell, and separately to Paul Ryan, authorizing that having to do with missile defense.
[00:26:29.173 --> 00:26:31.134]  And that's what we call triggering, right there.
[00:26:31.134 --> 00:26:32.615]  That big ol' bold signature.
[00:26:32.615 --> 00:26:34.256]  Okay.
[00:26:34.256 --> 00:26:34.677]  Now law.
[00:26:36.781 --> 00:26:38.602]  And they know they're up against prosperity.
[00:26:38.602 --> 00:26:40.942]  The globals want to kill prosperity in their own documents.
[00:26:40.942 --> 00:26:44.704]  So that's being done today, and that's going to be sent out.
[00:26:44.704 --> 00:26:52.646]  And then when I watched the news, as you know, we had the largest tax cuts in our history just approved.
[00:26:52.646 --> 00:27:00.989]  And I was going to wait for a formal signing sometime in early January, but then I watched the news this morning and they were all saying, will he keep his promise?
[00:27:00.989 --> 00:27:04.591]  Will he sign it by Christmas?
[00:27:04.591 --> 00:27:05.611]  But will he sign it?
[00:27:06.485 --> 00:27:07.826]  Goodbye Christmas.
[00:27:07.826 --> 00:27:11.070]  And I called downstairs, I said, get it ready, we have to sign it now.
[00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:15.414]  We're gonna wait till January 7th or 8th and do a big formal ceremony, but...
[00:27:16.728 --> 00:27:19.529]  Every one of the networks was saying, will he keep his promise?
[00:27:19.529 --> 00:27:23.470]  Will he sign it for Christmas, before Christmas?
[00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:24.770]  And so I immediately called.
[00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:26.130]  I said, let's get it ready.
[00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:37.613]  As you know, 3.2 trillion dollars in tax cuts for American families, including the doubling of the standard deduction and the doubling of the child tax credit.
[00:27:38.912 --> 00:27:42.337]  The typical family of four earning $75,000, we see an income tax cut of more than $2,000.
[00:27:47.225 --> 00:27:48.566]  Many much higher than that.
[00:27:48.566 --> 00:27:52.248]  Slashing their tax bill in half.
[00:27:52.248 --> 00:27:54.649]  And they're going to start to see that because we're signing today.
[00:27:54.649 --> 00:27:58.051]  They're going to start to see that in February.
[00:27:58.051 --> 00:27:59.272]  The numbers will speak.
[00:27:59.272 --> 00:28:02.334]  One of the big things that happened, you have some great companies.
[00:28:02.334 --> 00:28:06.476]  I want to thank AT&T, who actually was the first out of the box.
[00:28:06.476 --> 00:28:12.860]  And Boeing and Sinclair and Wells Fargo and Comcast, even though they own NBC, which is not so nice to
[00:28:13.823 --> 00:28:19.288]  We're going to come back with more of this on the other side because it's so important.
[00:28:35.757 --> 00:28:37.559]  And again, that's called presidential leadership.
[00:28:37.559 --> 00:28:44.007]  Now, even a lot of globalist companies are going, OK, we're going to give you $1,000, $2,000 extra bonuses on top of what you got.
[00:28:44.007 --> 00:28:48.632]  And we're going to move more stuff back here because they can now.
[00:28:48.632 --> 00:28:50.294]  Before, you could not compete.
[00:28:50.294 --> 00:28:54.820]  He's just removing the unfair barriers of the rigged game, the slanted field.
[00:28:55.473 --> 00:28:56.493]  Hey, Daniel Breman.
[00:28:56.493 --> 00:28:58.854]  Why NuMana storable foods?
[00:28:58.854 --> 00:29:00.175]  We believe in freedom.
[00:29:00.175 --> 00:29:03.576]  America needs strong, independent families to endure what's ahead.
[00:29:03.576 --> 00:29:05.096]  And we take this charge seriously.
[00:29:05.096 --> 00:29:06.157]  We got options.
[00:29:06.157 --> 00:29:06.817]  Organic.

[00:29:07.577 --> 00:29:08.878]  Without the chemicals.

[00:29:25.283 --> 00:29:27.904]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead.
[00:29:27.904 --> 00:29:28.925]  That's true.
[00:29:28.925 --> 00:29:33.988]  But did you know you can have tax-free access to your life insurance while you're still alive?
[00:29:33.988 --> 00:29:39.190]  You can use the life benefits of your life insurance to grow your money with certainty and guarantees.

[00:30:56.243 --> 00:31:03.733]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[00:31:05.365 --> 00:31:16.196]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other materiel from InfowarsStore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[00:31:16.196 --> 00:31:18.318]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[00:31:18.318 --> 00:31:22.061]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:31:22.061 --> 00:31:24.504]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best
[00:31:24.764 --> 00:31:29.565]  Fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[00:31:29.565 --> 00:31:31.946]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[00:31:31.946 --> 00:31:34.607]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[00:31:34.607 --> 00:31:35.507]  That's my dad.
[00:31:35.507 --> 00:31:37.388]  With colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[00:31:37.388 --> 00:31:41.809]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:31:41.809 --> 00:31:49.071]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[00:31:49.071 --> 00:31:53.492]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[00:31:56.807 --> 00:31:57.568]  I'm so excited.
[00:31:57.568 --> 00:32:06.174]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top.
[00:32:06.174 --> 00:32:07.755]  The Real Red Pill.
[00:32:07.755 --> 00:32:13.259]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[00:32:13.259 --> 00:32:16.281]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:32:16.281 --> 00:32:25.067]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:32:27.145 --> 00:32:46.741]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:32:46.741 --> 00:32:49.424]  It is amazing!
[00:32:49.424 --> 00:32:54.408]  Red Pill, now available at Infowarsstore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[00:32:59.145 --> 00:33:07.591]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:07.591 --> 00:33:22.341]  You gotta keep them separated.
[00:33:22.341 --> 00:33:28.386]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:37.646 --> 00:33:40.951]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:33:40.951 --> 00:33:46.900]  I am your host Alex Jones, and it is the 22nd day of December 2017.
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:49.084]  Thank you so much for tuning into the transmission.
[00:33:49.084 --> 00:33:50.326]  Okay, let's get right back to...
[00:33:51.505 --> 00:34:09.228]  The historic tax cuts, massive, across the board, designed to get rid of the globalist barriers that have artificially de-industrialized our nation and allowed the globalist corporations to parlay American gravitas, power, wealth, and military strength, ingenuity.
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:17.043]  Into a planetary takeover, not of America of the world, but of the globalists over the nation states.
[00:34:17.043 --> 00:34:29.489]  And all over the planet, that authoritarian operation is coming under major scrutiny, major heat, major legislative, and major populist resistance.
[00:34:29.489 --> 00:34:30.849]  And that's the facts.
[00:34:30.849 --> 00:34:35.631]  We're living in an incredibly historic time right now.
[00:34:35.631 --> 00:34:38.913]  There's a real war going on for the future of humanity.
[00:34:40.422 --> 00:34:44.586]  Against authoritarian, unelected, private world government and nation-states.
[00:34:44.586 --> 00:34:52.733]  Doesn't mean our nation-states are perfect, but they're here, they're local, they're made up of us, and we can take our country back.
[00:34:52.733 --> 00:34:57.016]  We can take our world back, and it's beginning to happen right now.
[00:34:57.016 --> 00:35:06.865]  By the way, Nikki Haley at the UN threatened to basically pull US funding, because the US pays close to half the UN funding, if they try to basically override
[00:35:07.839 --> 00:35:14.282]  The United States and its move to put a embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
[00:35:14.282 --> 00:35:15.763]  We've got that report coming up.
[00:35:15.763 --> 00:35:20.886]  We've got the market roaring forward on news of the massive tax cuts.
[00:35:20.886 --> 00:35:31.811]  But the next segment, I'm going to drill into Congressman Scalise's response to Obama adviser, Obama press briefer, Ben Rhodes, talking about
[00:35:32.538 --> 00:35:38.101]  Killing GOP leaders and their obituaries and all the rest of it.
[00:35:38.101 --> 00:35:39.903]  So that's coming up.
[00:35:39.903 --> 00:35:43.245]  Fox News kind of spins it and says, oh, they're just joking about it.
[00:35:43.245 --> 00:35:44.946]  No, they're not joking about it.
[00:35:44.946 --> 00:35:45.766]  They're dead serious.
[00:35:45.766 --> 00:35:47.327]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:35:47.327 --> 00:35:51.750]  Former Obama advisor calls for death of GOP leadership on Twitter.
[00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:53.031]  So that is coming up.
[00:35:53.031 --> 00:35:56.413]  Then it ties into that New York Times article that I was mentioning.
[00:35:56.413 --> 00:35:56.833]  But first,
[00:35:57.577 --> 00:36:06.963]  I want to finish up with a few minutes of the President, just a few hours ago, breaking down the historic tax cuts that he was signing.
[00:36:06.963 --> 00:36:13.187]  And the big fact that he ceremonially said, OK, it's law, but they were going to wait until January.
[00:36:13.187 --> 00:36:17.330]  That's customary on those type bills in the new year.
[00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:20.091]  But that the media kept saying, oh, it's all a lie.
[00:36:20.091 --> 00:36:23.553]  He didn't really plan to sign it.
[00:36:23.553 --> 00:36:24.274]  It's all fake.
[00:36:25.882 --> 00:36:28.063]  And so he said, OK, we'll do it right now.
[00:36:28.063 --> 00:36:32.146]  I mean, that's how they spin every single point.
[00:36:32.146 --> 00:36:35.127]  That's how they invert into upside down land.
[00:36:35.127 --> 00:36:38.509]  So let's go ahead and go to the rest of the president.
[00:36:38.509 --> 00:36:48.395]  AT&T, who actually was the first out of the box and Boeing and Sinclair and Wells Fargo and Comcast, even though they own NBC, which is not so nice to
[00:36:49.635 --> 00:36:53.559]  The presidency or the president, but Comcast also.
[00:36:53.559 --> 00:37:04.830]  They all have made tremendous contributions to their employees and tremendous contributions to spending money in this country because of the tax bill.
[00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:07.652]  And they all said it's because of the tax bill.
[00:37:07.652 --> 00:37:09.414]  So they're making tremendous investments.
[00:37:09.414 --> 00:37:10.235]  That means jobs.
[00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:13.532]  It means a lot of things, and we're very happy.
[00:37:13.532 --> 00:37:19.735]  So that's AT&T, Boeing, Sinclair, Wells Fargo, Comcast, and now many other companies, as you see.
[00:37:19.735 --> 00:37:23.578]  In fact, just this morning, I see three more companies came on.
[00:37:23.578 --> 00:37:27.140]  A friend of mine, Bob Kraft, called me last night.
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:29.501]  He said, this tax bill is incredible.
[00:37:29.501 --> 00:37:33.744]  He owns the New England Patriots, but he's in the paper business, too.
[00:37:33.744 --> 00:37:40.628]  And he said, based on this tax bill, he just wanted to let me know that he's going to buy a big plant
[00:37:41.528 --> 00:37:50.393]  In the great state of North Carolina, and he's going to build a tremendous paper mill there, or paper products plant.
[00:37:50.393 --> 00:38:03.840]  And I've had many calls such as that, where people that are entrepreneurs, people in business, they're going out and they're going to buy, frankly, factories that are closed, abandoned, and now they're not gonna be abandoned any longer.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.241]  Stop there for a minute.
[00:38:06.241 --> 00:38:07.402]  That's critical, because again,
[00:38:08.271 --> 00:38:17.453]  The climate was set up politically and economically where you really couldn't build viable factories and startup industries and many other systems in this country.
[00:38:17.453 --> 00:38:18.853]  We were being de-industrialized.
[00:38:18.853 --> 00:38:21.693]  We were told you're gonna be a service economy in the 80s and 90s.
[00:38:21.693 --> 00:38:24.774]  That's contracting, as everybody knows.
[00:38:24.774 --> 00:38:35.096]  And it was made to order for big monopolies like Amazon, Apple, Google, and others to come in and just totally consolidate control with their sweatshop style labor practices.
[00:38:36.167 --> 00:38:44.832]  Because again, they're allied with authoritarian states like China, Pakistan, and others to help oppress their own people.
[00:38:44.832 --> 00:38:48.134]  That tells you who they are, and that's coming up.
[00:38:48.134 --> 00:38:49.814]  That's coming up later in the next hour.
[00:38:49.814 --> 00:38:51.515]  I'm going to get into a whole section on that.
[00:38:51.515 --> 00:38:54.517]  It's so vitally important.
[00:38:54.517 --> 00:38:59.860]  There's some other good news, too, I want to get to, but the fact that the President's saying, hey, we're going to remove
[00:39:00.518 --> 00:39:03.879]  These unfair taxes, these trade barriers.
[00:39:03.879 --> 00:39:09.882]  It's a tariff when the US has a 38.9% and China has a 15.
[00:39:09.882 --> 00:39:15.384]  That's a tariff on money, on being located there.
[00:39:15.384 --> 00:39:24.028]  And that giant tariff of 20 plus points is going bye-bye next year.
[00:39:24.028 --> 00:39:24.448]  Bye-bye.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:32.082]  And imagine, it's always customary for a president to wait until the New Year to sign the full bill.
[00:39:32.082 --> 00:39:35.824]  Sometimes they'll ceremonially show the bill, but they'll generally not sign it.
[00:39:35.824 --> 00:39:49.249]  But the media had to spin that, oh, you didn't really get that victory, to just affect your mind, even if you know it's a lie, to kind of hit the dopamine receptors in your brain and tell you, no, you didn't have a victory, it was all a fraud, he wasn't real.
[00:39:49.249 --> 00:39:52.891]  Because then you've got to carry out the thought process and find out that they're liars.
[00:39:53.783 --> 00:40:04.233]  And the president's got a counter-strike back and then they whine and complain and go, how dare you say that?
[00:40:04.233 --> 00:40:05.113]  Blah, blah, blah.
[00:40:05.113 --> 00:40:13.581]  And I mean, every time he attacks mainstream media, when they're lying about him or us or anybody, they get upset and say, it's vicious, it's mean.
[00:40:13.581 --> 00:40:14.662]  You're not supposed to do that.
[00:40:14.662 --> 00:40:18.586]  And they do it over and over and over and over again.
[00:40:18.586 --> 00:40:19.887]  They're at war with us.
[00:40:21.351 --> 00:40:23.633]  Their position is the opposite of whatever we do.
[00:40:23.633 --> 00:40:25.494]  That's how they attack.
[00:40:25.494 --> 00:40:29.157]  The Democrats are caught colluding with the FBI to try to make up a dossier.
[00:40:29.157 --> 00:40:37.443]  They flip it around and claim that Congress is colluding with the President and making all of it up when it's all admitted.
[00:40:37.443 --> 00:40:38.284]  That's how they lie.
[00:40:38.284 --> 00:40:39.324]  It's how they obfuscate.
[00:40:39.324 --> 00:40:42.907]  It makes my head, quite frankly, spin sometimes.
[00:40:42.907 --> 00:40:44.908]  But let's finish up with the President.
[00:40:44.908 --> 00:40:46.930]  Bigger impact, faster than I thought.
[00:40:47.763 --> 00:40:52.244]  The corporate tax rate, as you know, will be lowered from 35 to 21 percent.
[00:40:52.244 --> 00:40:56.746]  That means that more products will be made in the USA.
[00:40:56.746 --> 00:40:58.606]  A lot of things are going to be happening in the USA.
[00:40:58.606 --> 00:41:00.307]  We're going to bring back our companies.
[00:41:00.307 --> 00:41:02.648]  They've already started coming back.
[00:41:02.648 --> 00:41:04.148]  I think they had certain confidence in me.
[00:41:04.148 --> 00:41:08.309]  They figured we were going to get this done, but they have already started.
[00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:17.152]  Something very important to me, the family farmers and small business owners who lost their business because of the estate tax, most of them won't have any estate tax to pay.
[00:41:18.082 --> 00:41:21.283]  It will be a great thing for their families.
[00:41:21.283 --> 00:41:23.604]  You can leave your farm to your family.
[00:41:23.604 --> 00:41:26.225]  You can leave your business, your small business, to your family.
[00:41:26.225 --> 00:41:30.667]  Not even so small, because the numbers are pretty big here.
[00:41:30.667 --> 00:41:34.188]  So they'll be exempt from having to pay a state tax, which will be tremendous.
[00:41:34.188 --> 00:41:37.530]  They'll keep their farms and their businesses and the family.
[00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:44.452]  Businesses will be able to deduct 100% of the cost of their capital investments in the year the investment is made.
[00:41:44.452 --> 00:41:45.573]  That's called expensing.
[00:41:46.454 --> 00:41:50.799]  And to do one-year expensing, I think, is going to be one of the biggest things in the bill, frankly.
[00:41:50.799 --> 00:41:55.524]  I think people are going to go out and absolutely go wild over expensing.
[00:41:55.524 --> 00:41:59.367]  Bob Kraft mentioned that last night in his telephone call.
[00:41:59.367 --> 00:42:04.533]  The fact that they can expense to one-year expensing is a fantastic asset.
[00:42:04.533 --> 00:42:08.457]  The historic small business tax cuts and pass-throughs now are
[00:42:09.455 --> 00:42:11.655]  Made really, really good for the business owner.
[00:42:11.655 --> 00:42:12.916]  They're hiring people.
[00:42:12.916 --> 00:42:15.276]  I see it on television.
[00:42:15.276 --> 00:42:16.296]  I'm reading about it all over.
[00:42:16.296 --> 00:42:18.757]  We're going to come back, my friends.
[00:42:18.757 --> 00:42:21.898]  He goes on for a long time.
[00:42:21.898 --> 00:42:26.258]  But this is such a gift back to the American people, their own money.
[00:42:26.258 --> 00:42:30.279]  And is the boot on our neck being partially removed?
[00:42:30.279 --> 00:42:31.960]  And everybody had confidence in Trump.
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:36.841]  That's why the economy stabilized, despite the fact the globalists were trying to kill it, admittedly were.
[00:42:36.841 --> 00:42:38.361]  And now that the delivery has happened,
[00:42:39.247 --> 00:42:42.812]  I think we're going to be at 10% growth rates in a year and a half.
[00:42:42.812 --> 00:42:48.098]  And if we can just maintain this, it's going to absolutely destroy globalism.
[00:42:48.098 --> 00:42:53.585]  We are witnessing a major turn of events, a reversal of the tables, right now at the end of 2017.
[00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:57.181]  Why is the fungus?
[00:42:57.181 --> 00:42:58.262]  Why is the mold?
[00:42:58.262 --> 00:42:59.983]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[00:42:59.983 --> 00:43:00.964]  What is going on?
[00:43:00.964 --> 00:43:01.724]  What has changed?
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:27.460]  We only have a limited supply of this.

[00:47:00.103 --> 00:47:08.548]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:08.548 --> 00:47:13.971]  It's the final countdown to the restoration of the Republic.
[00:47:13.971 --> 00:47:16.352]  The border's getting secured.
[00:47:29.898 --> 00:47:31.179]  Stock markets up.
[00:47:31.179 --> 00:47:33.101]  New jobs are exploding.
[00:47:33.101 --> 00:47:39.125]  Small businesses are showing record expansions and new startups.
[00:47:39.125 --> 00:47:41.887]  The information is simply amazing.
[00:47:41.887 --> 00:47:43.228]  The facts are in.
[00:47:43.228 --> 00:47:46.391]  Trump is doing what he said he would do.
[00:47:46.391 --> 00:47:49.833]  Even CNN and others have admitted that he's the promise keeper.
[00:47:49.833 --> 00:47:55.397]  But I didn't notice yesterday, the big headlines were, Will Trump really sign the bill?
[00:47:55.397 --> 00:47:57.279]  Or was it all a big lie?
[00:47:57.279 --> 00:47:57.439]  What?
[00:47:58.317 --> 00:48:04.079]  How would he fight so hard to get it passed and then not sign it after the New Year like you customarily do?
[00:48:04.079 --> 00:48:06.500]  So Trump said, fine.
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:08.760]  You don't want us to have a big ceremony then?
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:09.941]  You want to imply we're lying?
[00:48:09.941 --> 00:48:13.482]  We'll sign it today.
[00:48:13.482 --> 00:48:15.423]  And he came in and he signed it.
[00:48:15.423 --> 00:48:17.923]  He talked about how they're liars.
[00:48:17.923 --> 00:48:21.405]  Now, that said, I talk a lot about this because they don't want us to.
[00:48:21.405 --> 00:48:22.485]  And they're really upset about it.
[00:48:25.712 --> 00:48:41.280]  Mainstream media, in their own publications, as you know, as a listener and viewer of this show, or somebody that does your own research, mainstream media calls for the death of Trump, the death of his family, the death of his supporters, for a coup, for him to be killed.
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:49.805]  Phil Mudd, former deputy director of the CIA, went to the FBI under Mueller, the deputy director there, says that the government's going to kill Trump.
[00:48:49.805 --> 00:48:51.145]  Scalise got shot.
[00:48:51.145 --> 00:48:52.246]  Rand Paul got attacked.
[00:48:53.344 --> 00:48:57.086]  Republican mayors and city council members get shot in the head.
[00:48:57.086 --> 00:49:00.188]  You see Trump supporters getting beat up everywhere.
[00:49:00.188 --> 00:49:02.069]  Or people that are white getting beat up.
[00:49:02.069 --> 00:49:04.751]  And people saying, well, you're with Trump.
[00:49:04.751 --> 00:49:06.852]  We've seen the riots, the cop killing.
[00:49:06.852 --> 00:49:08.373]  We've seen all of it.
[00:49:08.373 --> 00:49:09.553]  And the resist movement.
[00:49:09.553 --> 00:49:11.534]  And we're going to drive Trump from office.
[00:49:11.534 --> 00:49:13.095]  Full page ads in the New York Times.
[00:49:13.095 --> 00:49:16.037]  And New York Times writers saying, somebody killed Trump.
[00:49:16.037 --> 00:49:18.058]  And Newsweek, it's time to riot.
[00:49:18.058 --> 00:49:19.219]  And it's time to kill.
[00:49:21.631 --> 00:49:22.451]  On and on and on.
[00:49:22.451 --> 00:49:25.813]  And then when we talk about it, they go, Jones is crazy.
[00:49:25.813 --> 00:49:26.793]  There's no plan.
[00:49:26.793 --> 00:49:40.039]  And then it comes out that the president has his own private military security that's been there since he was president-elect, and that they actually do fear rogue CIA and FBI groups from the Stay Behind Clinton network trying to kill him.
[00:49:42.418 --> 00:49:44.279]  So, that's the game they play.
[00:49:44.279 --> 00:49:51.941]  But then, as they gear up now, because their Russia thing's falling apart, their sexgate stuff's falling apart, all of it's falling apart as Trump delivers.
[00:49:51.941 --> 00:50:00.444]  And as we, the American people, deliver, supporting Trump, supporting ourselves, as we begin to turn the corner, we enter the maximum danger zone.
[00:50:00.444 --> 00:50:01.144]  Now, there's the headline.
[00:50:01.144 --> 00:50:02.545]  Seen an analyst on Trump.
[00:50:02.545 --> 00:50:04.465]  The government's gonna kill this guy.
[00:50:04.465 --> 00:50:08.387]  So, he's the former head of counterterrorism of the CIA.
[00:50:08.387 --> 00:50:09.507]  That's the part that has the teeth.
[00:50:10.054 --> 00:50:11.835]  That's the part that tortures people and all that.
[00:50:11.835 --> 00:50:13.176]  He's been in lawsuits over it.
[00:50:13.176 --> 00:50:15.758]  So, I mean, he's a killer or a guy that commands killers.
[00:50:15.758 --> 00:50:17.999]  And he's there saying, we're going to kill him.
[00:50:17.999 --> 00:50:20.181]  The government's going to kill him.
[00:50:20.181 --> 00:50:22.843]  I pointed out, the media goes, oh, you're crazy.
[00:50:22.843 --> 00:50:30.528]  They have the Aspen Institute with Wolf Blitzer, Brennan, and Clapper, former head of the CIA, former head of national intelligence.
[00:50:30.528 --> 00:50:33.049]  And they go, he'll be gone by the end of the year.
[00:50:33.049 --> 00:50:36.292]  And Blitzer goes, impeachment?
[00:50:36.292 --> 00:50:38.273]  And they go, no, extra judicially.
[00:50:39.184 --> 00:50:41.105]  That means outside of law.
[00:50:41.105 --> 00:50:47.430]  Extrajudicial means throw a bag over your head, throw you in a van, and take you to a place to throw you in a vat of acid.
[00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:48.831]  Or put cement shoes on you.
[00:50:48.831 --> 00:50:50.693]  What it means is we're gonna kill him.
[00:50:50.693 --> 00:50:57.017]  And then congressmen were briefed on this by the Democrats that said, you better get in line when Trump disappears.
[00:50:57.017 --> 00:51:00.260]  All you Republicans speak out when he goes down, you're next.
[00:51:01.227 --> 00:51:06.610]  And Republicans have gone public, that the Democrats have been very threatening in private, not just in public.
[00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:14.615]  So they've been bravadoing around like the big rooster in the barnyard.
[00:51:14.615 --> 00:51:25.602]  They've been walking around kicking and strutting and getting everybody's face to act powerful so that their own minions hold on inside their bureaucratic stay-behind networks.
[00:51:25.602 --> 00:51:29.985]  And the media runs articles about how great it is and how they're not following orders and how they're doing this and that.
[00:51:30.689 --> 00:51:33.511]  Bloomberg reported on it, what, on Monday.
[00:51:33.511 --> 00:51:34.451]  Again.
[00:51:34.451 --> 00:51:38.433]  So, New York Times column says Trump is about to stage a coup.
[00:51:38.433 --> 00:51:53.421]  New York Times contributor said that the President Trump hysteria meter to 11 on Thursday when he wrote that the President and his allies seem to be on the verge of staging a coup against independent institutions and the rule of law.
[00:51:53.421 --> 00:51:57.143]  It's you guys with the fake dossiers and the illegal spying and all the criminal networks.
[00:51:58.121 --> 00:52:13.689]  In the column, The Real Coup Plot Is Trump, New York Times contributor and Harvard University lecturer, Yashaka Monkakamonkabonger, however you say it, warns readers about the upcoming assault on American democracy that the president is plotting.
[00:52:13.689 --> 00:52:22.634]  Fox News host Jesse Waters recently claimed that in the midst of all the alleged bias with the FBI, that we have a coup on our hands in America.
[00:52:22.634 --> 00:52:22.934]  Monk
[00:52:23.843 --> 00:52:29.146]  Doesn't cite any evidence that Trump is preparing to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, the president after all.
[00:52:29.146 --> 00:52:32.007]  He said repeatedly that he doesn't intend to.
[00:52:32.007 --> 00:52:37.970]  If you dare criticize Mueller, you're making yourself an act of accomplice, as a quote, and deliberate assault on our democracy.
[00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:46.655]  That's right, if you defend yourself from a kangaroo rogue group put in by the Clintons that's been proven to be a fraud, if you even speak back at them, it's like talking back to God.
[00:52:46.655 --> 00:52:48.035]  You don't do that.
[00:52:48.035 --> 00:52:48.896]  Mueller is God.
[00:52:49.631 --> 00:52:55.755]  Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell were busy passing tax cuts for over 80% of Americans.
[00:52:55.755 --> 00:53:02.140]  Now they're equally to blame for the public's growing mistrust of the Russia probe, according to the New York Times.
[00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:03.441]  So, see?
[00:53:03.441 --> 00:53:05.842]  Now, that brings us to this little jewel.
[00:53:05.842 --> 00:53:15.049]  Obama advisor and press briefer Ben Rhodes swam for tweet joking about GOP leaders and obits.
[00:53:15.049 --> 00:53:16.410]  Well, he wasn't joking.
[00:53:18.166 --> 00:53:22.307]  He came out and said he can't wait to see them in obituaries.
[00:53:22.307 --> 00:53:25.808]  Former Obama advisor calls for death of GOP on Twitter.
[00:53:25.808 --> 00:53:29.209]  Obama aide Ben Rhodes hopes to see Ryan McConnell and Pence dead.
[00:53:29.209 --> 00:53:31.350]  Obama advisor Ben Rhodes, but he won't do it.
[00:53:31.350 --> 00:53:33.631]  He'll just hype it and hope some crazy does.
[00:53:33.631 --> 00:53:43.314]  Obama, Ben Rhodes, a supporter, crossed the line with many Americans when he tweeted that he hopes for the death of Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, and Mike Pence.
[00:53:43.314 --> 00:53:44.194]  Another Obama aide
[00:53:44.955 --> 00:53:54.379]  Tan Pfeiffer commented on Instagram picture posted by Donald Trump saying, I hope this is the photo they use on the front page of the Times the day he is indicted.
[00:53:54.379 --> 00:53:56.000]  What, by your swamp creature?
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:02.282]  I hope this is the photo, again, that they have on the front page of the Times the day he is indicted.
[00:54:02.282 --> 00:54:08.645]  And then Ben Rhodes says, alongside the obits for Ryan, McConnell, and Pence.
[00:54:08.645 --> 00:54:12.627]  Yeah, helping take the foot off the neck of the American people under our push.
[00:54:13.832 --> 00:54:17.074]  And getting real tax cuts, and getting real reform on corporate tax.
[00:54:17.074 --> 00:54:18.555]  Man, that makes you angry, doesn't it?
[00:54:18.555 --> 00:54:22.036]  Because you hate Flyover America.
[00:54:22.036 --> 00:54:24.578]  You hate the American people, you parasite.
[00:54:24.578 --> 00:54:27.819]  You see, they're globalists, hired because they're bad people.
[00:54:27.819 --> 00:54:31.682]  And people that always abuse somebody, or suck off of them, they never love them.
[00:54:31.682 --> 00:54:33.502]  They always hate who they're abusing.
[00:54:33.502 --> 00:54:36.224]  They always hate who they're robbing, so they can feel good about it.
[00:54:36.224 --> 00:54:36.904]  You understand?
[00:54:36.904 --> 00:54:38.145]  That's how parasites operate.
[00:54:40.282 --> 00:54:53.334]  Republican Steve Scalise of Louisiana who survived the assassination attempt in June, when a psychotic liberal targeted conservative politicians replied to Rhodes by warning, you may want to reconsider your rhetoric.
[00:54:53.334 --> 00:54:55.596]  So this is literally a down with the USA.
[00:54:56.525 --> 00:54:57.425]  Crowned.
[00:54:57.425 --> 00:55:00.226]  Meanwhile, myself and Roger Stone go to the shooting range.
[00:55:00.226 --> 00:55:05.908]  We tongue-in-cheek joke around, you know, that they're all calling for martial law and war and, you know, they're going to come after us, we're going to defend ourselves.
[00:55:05.908 --> 00:55:08.489]  But, you know, we hope to be able to defeat them and it doesn't go to that point.
[00:55:08.489 --> 00:55:16.112]  But we clearly prefaced it five or six times that we don't believe in offensive operations, we believe in defensive.
[00:55:16.112 --> 00:55:21.274]  And so Roger admits he doesn't go shooting often, so they point out that he didn't have perfect etiquette and things like that.
[00:55:21.274 --> 00:55:22.974]  We said that in the video.
[00:55:22.974 --> 00:55:24.695]  It was an hour and a half live feed.
[00:55:25.658 --> 00:55:31.519]  But they then imply that we are calling for violence and that we are calling for all of this.
[00:55:31.519 --> 00:55:36.901]  When we're saying you're calling for it, we're here to defend ourselves.
[00:55:36.901 --> 00:55:41.242]  Alex Jones and Roger Stone visited a gun range to prepare for civil war if Trump is removed from office.
[00:55:41.242 --> 00:55:45.283]  And now that they've written about it, now hundreds of publications will write about it, which is good.
[00:55:45.283 --> 00:55:48.423]  I'm trolling them.
[00:55:48.423 --> 00:55:51.444]  I'm betting on the people seeing through your propaganda.
[00:55:52.273 --> 00:55:57.975]  All right, coming up, we're going to look at the shakeup at Google and what's really behind that as Eric Schmidt is out.
[00:55:57.975 --> 00:56:00.336]  We're going to look at the globalist operations.
[00:56:00.336 --> 00:56:12.001]  We're going to also look at Facebook team helping regimes round up and imprison and kill people and how that ties into what's happening here inside of the United States.
[00:56:12.001 --> 00:56:17.163]  We'll look at Jorge Ramos saying he's now having the worst time of his life living in the U.S.
[00:56:18.164 --> 00:56:31.514]  Meanwhile, illegal migrants embody the best of our nation, says Democrat leader Nancy Pelosi, as new statistics come out showing a very high crime rate, because statistically some of the group coming over are criminal, and they do it because their identity is not known.
[00:56:31.514 --> 00:56:33.016]  Looks like a happy hunting ground.
[00:56:33.016 --> 00:56:34.857]  Meanwhile, so it was terrorism!
[00:56:34.857 --> 00:56:39.961]  Attacker who rammed his car into victims upset at mistreatment of Muslims!
[00:56:39.961 --> 00:56:43.103]  But the media said he was a Muslim, but he was just mentally ill.
[00:56:43.103 --> 00:56:43.944]  So the ongoing
[00:56:46.061 --> 00:56:47.682]  Cover-up only intensifies.
[00:56:47.682 --> 00:56:52.664]  By the way, I want to thank you all for doing a lot of your Christmas shopping at infowarestore.com.
[00:56:52.664 --> 00:56:59.247]  It's still time in many areas of the country to be able to get shipped products before Christmas, but it doesn't matter.

[00:57:23.379 --> 00:57:24.660]  This is beyond probiotics.
[00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:25.760]  It's next level.
[00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:28.462]  And it's 25% off, even though it's been sold out for six months.
[00:57:28.462 --> 00:57:33.765]  MycoZX, it goes great with our Floralife, 50 billion live culture, super high quality probiotics.

[00:57:53.719 --> 00:57:58.520]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:00.241]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:58:00.241 --> 00:58:01.901]  Well, so does he.
[00:58:01.901 --> 00:58:07.943]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:58:07.943 --> 00:58:23.287]  I'm going to open the phones up at the bottom of the hour, and I want to specifically ask you, the listeners, we're starting to really turn the tide and have some big victories of nationalism, of productivity and prosperity for the average person, the cornucopia of the free market.
[00:58:23.979 --> 00:58:25.380]  The globalists don't like that, obviously.
[00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:27.842]  How are they going to counter-strike?
[00:58:27.842 --> 00:58:32.286]  What do you expect them to do, claiming Trump's involved in a coup, so they've got to remove him?
[00:58:32.286 --> 00:58:39.412]  See, that's what they're doing, but they turn it around, so when they engage in it, they claim they're stopping a dictator, when there's no evidence of that.
[00:58:39.412 --> 00:58:40.593]  What do you think they're going to pull?
[00:58:40.593 --> 00:58:42.795]  What do you think they've got up their sleeve?
[00:58:42.795 --> 00:58:44.597]  What do they got in their back pocket?
[00:58:44.597 --> 00:58:45.858]  What's the race in the hole?
[00:58:46.488 --> 00:58:52.753]  Toll-free number to join us, 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[00:58:52.753 --> 00:58:58.317]  Long-time callers, first-time callers, I want to hear from you specifically on that subject and the historic tax cuts.
[00:58:58.317 --> 00:59:00.519]  What do you think of them?
[00:59:00.519 --> 00:59:02.301]  And there's over 30 big things it does.
[00:59:02.301 --> 00:59:03.762]  It's just dizzying.
[00:59:05.098 --> 00:59:06.339]  Is Trump not real?
[00:59:06.339 --> 00:59:07.740]  He does some things I don't like.
[00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:09.721]  But he really is the president.
[00:59:09.721 --> 00:59:12.402]  He really is returning power back to our nation.
[00:59:12.402 --> 00:59:13.762]  It really is a big deal.
[00:59:13.762 --> 00:59:17.064]  And we've got so many other big stories we're going to cover in the next segment.
[00:59:17.064 --> 00:59:20.226]  But first I want to play this piece here.
[00:59:20.226 --> 00:59:23.247]  Dems lead delusional uprising over possible Mueller firing.
[00:59:25.013 --> 00:59:34.482]  Voices of blind hypocrisy want Americans to know that we should ignore all of the overwhelming evidence of a fabricated witch hunt against President Trump.
[00:59:34.482 --> 00:59:47.273]  Instead, join them in their flabbergasted disgust that anyone would even consider ending Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russia-White House collusion fiction.
[00:59:47.273 --> 00:59:51.597]  Mr. President, I rise today concerned about the threats
[00:59:52.612 --> 00:59:59.836]  The Special Counsel's critical investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
[00:59:59.836 --> 01:00:13.405]  Over the last several weeks, a growing chorus of irresponsible and reckless voices have called for President Trump to shut down Special Counsel Mueller's investigation.
[01:00:13.405 --> 01:00:18.668]  At first, these calls came from the fringes of our political discourse.
[01:00:19.841 --> 01:00:26.244]  Those who would refuse to put our country and our security before base political instincts.
[01:00:26.244 --> 01:00:27.305]  Yeah, none of this is true.
[01:00:27.305 --> 01:00:34.329]  Earlier this year, many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle were right to push back.
[01:00:34.329 --> 01:00:37.070]  We don't want him to go anywhere now, he's just totally discredited.
[01:00:37.070 --> 01:00:42.273]  And urge that the special counsel be allowed to do his job without interference.
[01:00:42.273 --> 01:00:47.456]  Yeah, that means let him violate the law, let him do whatever he wants, don't talk back to him, he's God.
[01:00:48.462 --> 01:00:52.463]  No, what's growing is he's discredited.
[01:00:52.463 --> 01:00:54.284]  He's been caught red-handed.
[01:00:54.284 --> 01:00:54.324]  Oh!
[01:01:08.081 --> 01:01:11.285]  That the fix was in against Donald Trump from the beginning.
[01:01:11.285 --> 01:01:12.226]  You know who said coup first, right?
[01:01:12.226 --> 01:01:22.579]  I sat through a Judiciary Committee hearing that I thought was disgraceful with members on the other side of the aisle trying to smear not only FBI Director Christopher Wray
[01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:25.282]  I mean, we can beat these guys.
[01:01:25.282 --> 01:01:26.403]  These are wimps.
[01:01:26.403 --> 01:01:27.825]  Trying to play dictator.
[01:01:27.825 --> 01:01:30.027]  You're not going to stop our prosperity.
[01:01:30.027 --> 01:01:31.509]  You're not running our lives anymore.
[01:01:31.509 --> 01:01:34.952]  You're not getting our guns, Phil.
[01:01:34.952 --> 01:01:45.303]  Wait till you see what happens if the President actually tries to take these unconstitutional and what would really amount to criminal actions because he would be obstructing justice.
[01:01:45.623 --> 01:01:45.983]  Uh-huh.
[01:01:45.983 --> 01:01:47.104]  Ooh, where'd that come from?
[01:01:47.104 --> 01:01:49.604]  Yeah, they want to kill Trump, lock him up for no reason.
[01:01:49.604 --> 01:01:52.945]  We just say, Hillary for president, lock her up, and then we're the bad guys.
[01:02:12.245 --> 01:02:16.186]  They inhabit a world of law, facts, and evidence.
[01:02:16.186 --> 01:02:16.986]  Oh yeah, Mueller does.
[01:02:16.986 --> 01:02:20.186]  They cannot be forced to execute the president's personal... Where?
[01:02:20.186 --> 01:02:21.387]  In fantasy land?
[01:02:21.387 --> 01:02:24.307]  Where prosecute his enemies, real or imagined?
[01:02:24.307 --> 01:02:27.088]  Or in a magical kingdom, like in your hair?
[01:02:27.088 --> 01:02:30.088]  What's that Dr. Seuss book where like they live in somebody's hair?
[01:02:30.088 --> 01:02:32.289]  It's a whole universe?
[01:02:32.289 --> 01:02:38.130]  Someone please show me a Democrat not politicizing every aspect of... We'll be right back.
[01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:38.930]  Good job, John Bowne.
[01:02:42.310 --> 01:02:57.847]  Hey, if you want to slow down your aging process and protect your heart and brain from constant exposure to harmful toxins, then you need DNA Force, the most complete, full-spectrum, age-defying, cell-protecting formula in the world.

[01:03:09.337 --> 01:03:10.978]  And now, just in time for Christmas,
[01:03:26.209 --> 01:03:27.130]  Big Brother.
[01:03:27.130 --> 01:03:27.770]  Mainstream Media.
[01:03:54.845 --> 01:03:57.446]  Government cover us.
[01:03:57.446 --> 01:03:59.347]  You want answers?
[01:03:59.347 --> 01:04:01.288]  Well, so does he.
[01:04:01.288 --> 01:04:09.472]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:04:09.472 --> 01:04:14.475]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, maybe even sooner, I'm gonna take your phone calls on Trump's first year.
[01:04:14.475 --> 01:04:17.556]  Does he hit the ground running as president-elect?
[01:04:17.556 --> 01:04:21.818]  So, I'd say it's about a year now, even though January 20th is when he got in officially.
[01:04:21.818 --> 01:04:23.719]  November, you know, 8th is when he got
[01:04:24.703 --> 01:04:27.824]  Uh, became president-elect, but he hit the ground running.
[01:04:27.824 --> 01:04:32.885]  I'd say right about now, Trump has been president for a year.
[01:04:32.885 --> 01:04:34.186]  He did hit the ground running.
[01:04:34.186 --> 01:04:35.726]  He understood times of the essence.
[01:04:35.726 --> 01:04:37.627]  He couldn't let the economy stall out.
[01:04:37.627 --> 01:04:50.070]  First thing he did, before he even got his government organized, was make thousands of phone calls, telling corporations he was going to cut taxes and please invest in America, or the whole thing's going to go belly up.
[01:04:50.070 --> 01:04:52.491]  Then he called and thanked people politically for what they'd done.
[01:04:53.419 --> 01:04:54.599]  Myself and others.
[01:04:54.599 --> 01:04:55.420]  Thousands.
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:56.140]  Thousands.
[01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:58.921]  He's a titanous workhorse.
[01:04:58.921 --> 01:05:06.043]  And then he called world leaders and people and started talking to them and doing diplomatic stuff.
[01:05:06.043 --> 01:05:08.284]  And that's all on record what the President did.
[01:05:08.284 --> 01:05:09.744]  First, stabilize the economy.
[01:05:09.744 --> 01:05:11.705]  Emergency, emergency, emergency.
[01:05:11.705 --> 01:05:13.865]  Then thank the people that helped.
[01:05:13.865 --> 01:05:16.526]  Then start dealing with the rest of the world.
[01:05:16.526 --> 01:05:18.107]  But first, stabilize the ship.
[01:05:18.107 --> 01:05:19.147]  America first.
[01:05:19.147 --> 01:05:20.047]  America first.
[01:05:20.047 --> 01:05:21.048]  America first.
[01:05:21.048 --> 01:05:21.748]  America first.
[01:05:26.528 --> 01:05:41.002]  And now, a year later, Trump's been in a year now, and this is a fair time to average all the stuff he did as president-elect with when he officially became president.
[01:05:41.002 --> 01:05:44.926]  He's been a president a year, and how has he done?
[01:05:44.926 --> 01:05:47.449]  What do you think about the situation?
[01:05:47.449 --> 01:05:48.369]  What are the pluses?
[01:05:48.369 --> 01:05:49.130]  What are the minuses?
[01:05:49.130 --> 01:05:49.851]  But just remember,
[01:05:52.361 --> 01:05:53.221]  He's not God.
[01:05:53.221 --> 01:05:54.802]  He can't get it all done.
[01:05:54.802 --> 01:05:56.583]  I'm surprised how much he's gotten done.
[01:05:56.583 --> 01:05:58.804]  It's been miraculous.
[01:05:58.804 --> 01:06:00.965]  And they said he'd never get the tax cuts through.
[01:06:00.965 --> 01:06:01.886]  On and on and on.
[01:06:01.886 --> 01:06:04.067]  And they played all the race games.
[01:06:04.067 --> 01:06:06.748]  There's new statistics out.
[01:06:06.748 --> 01:06:14.232]  And it's not that Hispanics that make up something like 70% of immigrants coming to the country are inherently criminal.
[01:06:14.232 --> 01:06:20.215]  It's that there is a contingent already fleeing justice, like Americans flee to Mexico and vice versa,
[01:06:20.808 --> 01:06:35.494]  That don't have real names, have fake IDs that the Mexican Consulate will give them, all these corrupt state governments and local governments will give them IDs, and they are just above the law, and they mainly feed, if you look at the statistics, on other Hispanics.
[01:06:35.494 --> 01:06:43.237]  So, I'm gonna go to some new statistics in a moment with Tucker Carlson breaking that down, but Jorge Ramos.
[01:06:43.237 --> 01:06:48.840]  I mean, I can't go to Mexico and then go have a baby for free and have it taken care of.
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:49.420]  They'd laugh at me.
[01:06:50.217 --> 01:06:55.941]  I can't go to Mexico and just do whatever I want, especially if I'm not working.
[01:06:55.941 --> 01:07:00.685]  Mexico gets illegal aliens from Latin America and gives them six months to a year hard labor and tortures them.
[01:07:00.685 --> 01:07:01.706]  That's the Leningradian.
[01:07:01.706 --> 01:07:03.927]  And I'm not defending that.
[01:07:03.927 --> 01:07:08.150]  The point is acting like America is the worst thing on earth is not true.
[01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:15.356]  And then the Democrats try to turn Hispanics particularly into a new racial group and make it race based politics.
[01:07:15.356 --> 01:07:16.977]  And that's failing.
[01:07:16.977 --> 01:07:18.458]  And that's good news for everybody.
[01:07:20.339 --> 01:07:24.362]  So, Jorge Ramos says he's now having the worst time of his life in the U.S.
[01:07:24.362 --> 01:07:29.405]  With Donald Trump there, I have never been treated so badly.
[01:07:29.405 --> 01:07:31.486]  I've never been insulted so much.
[01:07:31.486 --> 01:07:33.527]  We've never been attacked so much.
[01:07:33.527 --> 01:07:41.032]  They have never tried to run us out as much as now, Ramos vented in an interview with the Spanish radio network.
[01:07:41.764 --> 01:07:53.574]  Ramos, who proclaimed himself as not the enemy, but an opponent of Trump in the interview, complained about the massive blowback he's received since deciding to use his media platform to openly oppose the choice.
[01:07:55.592 --> 01:07:58.655]  Over 62 million Americans who voted last year's election.
[01:07:58.655 --> 01:08:00.617]  Then he complains about social networks.
[01:08:00.617 --> 01:08:05.382]  The social networks are 10 to 1 against libertarians, nationalists, and conservatives.
[01:08:05.382 --> 01:08:07.144]  But we know most of them are bots.
[01:08:07.144 --> 01:08:07.725]  We know it's fake.
[01:08:07.725 --> 01:08:09.546]  So we don't care if we get ridiculed.
[01:08:09.546 --> 01:08:10.848]  We keep hammering back.
[01:08:10.848 --> 01:08:17.695]  But everybody knows the Democrats, the globalists, the liberals are way more threatening, way more hateful, constantly calling for violence.
[01:08:19.278 --> 01:08:32.261]  And then, when Kate Stanley gets shot in the back, and the virtue signaling, mainly white jury, lets the guy who'd been deported, what, five times, and committed all these crimes, lets him go!
[01:08:32.261 --> 01:08:33.681]  Not even manslaughter!
[01:08:33.681 --> 01:08:37.602]  Not even accidental!
[01:08:37.602 --> 01:08:43.043]  Because they couldn't signal that it was wrong to shoot her in the back.
[01:08:43.043 --> 01:08:43.663]  What about Kate?
[01:08:43.663 --> 01:08:48.844]  Well, signs were put up at the university there in San Francisco, and folks pulled them down,
[01:08:49.927 --> 01:08:51.028]  And said, this is racist.
[01:08:51.028 --> 01:08:52.488]  All it said was, she had dreams too.
[01:08:52.488 --> 01:08:54.429]  Like, she's a human too.
[01:08:54.429 --> 01:08:55.550]  She has rights too.
[01:08:55.550 --> 01:09:02.373]  But then Nancy Pelosi virtue signals and says, illegal migrants embody the best of our nation.
[01:09:02.373 --> 01:09:10.917]  Not migrants, not people coming here to work, not people coming here to be Americans, but migrants, which means illegals.
[01:09:10.917 --> 01:09:16.339]  Illegal migrants, quote, embody the best of our nation, says the leader of the Democrats in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi.
[01:09:17.310 --> 01:09:27.419]  The flattery of illegals came December 21st as Pelosi urged the House Committee on Rules to include an amnesty for 3.25 million dreamer illegals in two-week budget resolution.
[01:09:27.419 --> 01:09:30.522]  The problem is most of those folks are 40 years old with fake names.
[01:09:30.522 --> 01:09:31.463]  They're not really dreamers.
[01:09:31.463 --> 01:09:40.371]  It's kind of like the Islamicist, where you got 30-year-old and 25-year-old men in Dutch, Swedish, and German schools, because they say they're 16.
[01:09:43.644 --> 01:09:50.349]  And then she goes on to say, they embody the best of our nation's patriotism, hard work, perseverance, Pelosi said of the dreamers.
[01:09:50.349 --> 01:09:54.813]  She added that Congress shouldn't leave them to celebrate the holidays in fear.
[01:09:54.813 --> 01:09:55.293]  Oh really?
[01:09:55.293 --> 01:09:58.075]  What about Kate Stanley?
[01:09:58.075 --> 01:10:04.280]  Meanwhile, so it was terrorism, attacker who rammed his car into victims upset at mistreatment of Muslims.
[01:10:05.982 --> 01:10:11.324]  And of course, you've had hundreds of these attacks the last few years in Russia, Europe, here, all over.
[01:10:11.324 --> 01:10:13.945]  And most of the time, they'll never even say it's Islamicist.
[01:10:13.945 --> 01:10:17.666]  In fact, in Sweden and in other areas, they won't release the name.
[01:10:17.666 --> 01:10:24.968]  They've passed laws and regulations saying it's racist if the guy's name is Habib or Hammamad or Ahmed or whatever.
[01:10:24.968 --> 01:10:26.549]  It's just incredible.
[01:10:26.549 --> 01:10:31.551]  So that story's up on NewsWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com from Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:10:31.551 --> 01:10:32.371]  Please hear it out to everybody.
[01:10:33.770 --> 01:10:41.415]  Meanwhile, Morris, he comes out, more of a classical liberal, and says, fake news media get angry if you say something that reflects the will of Europe.
[01:10:41.415 --> 01:10:50.782]  Yeah, they're saying it's racist to want to have vetted people coming into the country, when all the globalists are doing is openly erasing people's cultures.
[01:10:50.782 --> 01:11:01.390]  Now, let's go to the Tucker Carlson piece, where they break down these statistics, never-before-seen statistics proving illegal aliens commit massively disproportionate amount of crime.
[01:11:02.045 --> 01:11:10.548]  This evening we've got brand new numbers, striking numbers that have never been seen before and they may reshape how you think about illegal immigration.
[01:11:11.366 --> 01:11:13.207]  So you've heard the same line a million times.
[01:11:13.207 --> 01:11:17.610]  It's repeated like a mantra by the left during every debate on the subject.
[01:11:17.610 --> 01:11:20.191]  All immigrants are hard-working and law-abiding.
[01:11:20.191 --> 01:11:24.054]  They do jobs you wouldn't consider doing, and they do them cheerfully.
[01:11:24.054 --> 01:11:27.355]  They sacrifice for their families in ways you probably don't.
[01:11:27.355 --> 01:11:34.760]  In fact, and this is always the last point, it's always delivered with the confidence and satisfaction of someone shutting down a debate with superior data.
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:41.781]  Undocumented immigrants actually commit fewer crimes on average than native-born Americans.
[01:11:41.781 --> 01:11:45.862]  Not only are immigrants more virtuous than you are, but they're safer to be around.
[01:11:45.862 --> 01:11:47.842]  In other words, stop complaining!
[01:11:47.842 --> 01:11:50.223]  They're your superiors.
[01:11:50.223 --> 01:11:53.703]  But wait, are we sure that that is true?
[01:11:53.703 --> 01:12:02.345]  Are people who are in this country precisely because they were willing to break our immigration laws really less likely to break other kinds of laws?
[01:12:03.594 --> 01:12:05.102]  Doesn't make a lot of sense.
[01:12:05.976 --> 01:12:12.361]  Yet until today, strangely enough, no one could say for sure whether it was true.
[01:12:12.361 --> 01:12:15.943]  Because reliable statistics didn't seem to exist.
[01:12:15.943 --> 01:12:19.766]  Our government tracks pretty much every trend and every phenomenon you can think of.
[01:12:19.766 --> 01:12:26.791]  From how many pounds of pistachio nuts are recalled every year, to how many fifth graders are injured on swing sets, how many people die in bathtubs.
[01:12:26.791 --> 01:12:28.052]  This is a nation of record keepers.
[01:12:28.052 --> 01:12:31.655]  We're overseen by an army of spreadsheet-wielding bureaucrats.
[01:12:31.655 --> 01:12:33.296]  Numbers control our lives.
[01:12:33.296 --> 01:12:34.137]  Except on this subject.
[01:12:34.958 --> 01:12:43.107]  Somehow, the government went for years without honestly trying to track the volume of crime committed by illegal immigrants in this country.
[01:12:43.107 --> 01:12:45.470]  Maybe they were too incompetent to do it.
[01:12:45.470 --> 01:12:49.134]  More likely, they didn't want you to know the answer, or to think about it even.
[01:12:49.134 --> 01:12:52.198]  In any case, we now for the first time have the actual numbers, and here they are.
[01:12:52.979 --> 01:12:54.680]  According to statistics from the U.S.
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:13:01.647]  Sentencing Commission, non-citizens are actually far more likely to commit serious crimes than Americans are.
[01:13:01.647 --> 01:13:07.453]  Non-citizens account for 22 percent, more than a fifth, of all federal murder convictions.
[01:13:07.453 --> 01:13:09.395]  You know what, let's stop right here.
[01:13:09.395 --> 01:13:10.836]  Let's back this up about 30 seconds.
[01:13:10.836 --> 01:13:12.578]  I'm going to come back and break this down.
[01:13:12.578 --> 01:13:15.281]  And the reason I knew this was the statistics were already there.
[01:13:16.838 --> 01:13:29.086]  Hispanic immigrants on average have a low crime rate, but there is a minority subgroup of hardened criminals that commit hugely disproportionate amounts of crime because they can't be tracked.
[01:13:29.086 --> 01:13:30.668]  That's why you have this anomaly.
[01:13:30.668 --> 01:13:32.149]  We'll explain it on the other side.
[01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:35.151]  Both sides of this are actually true.
[01:13:35.151 --> 01:13:35.591]  Stay with us.
[01:13:41.494 --> 01:13:48.016]  KD Armor has been on a mission to manufacture the most comfortable body armor on the market, and we've succeeded.

[01:14:49.857 --> 01:14:52.839]  But they're hiding something great on the inside.
[01:14:52.839 --> 01:14:55.081]  No, there are no pyrotechnics.
[01:14:55.081 --> 01:14:57.462]  And it doesn't sing when you open it.
[01:14:57.462 --> 01:14:59.564]  But it does have magical powers.

[01:15:44.410 --> 01:15:45.750]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:46.971]  Why is this show good?
[01:15:46.971 --> 01:15:52.253]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:15:52.253 --> 01:16:05.797]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:16:05.797 --> 01:16:07.158]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:16:08.078 --> 01:16:09.579]  Spreading disease around.
[01:16:09.579 --> 01:16:12.161]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:16:12.161 --> 01:16:13.461]  These are all parasites.
[01:16:13.461 --> 01:16:14.562]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:16:14.562 --> 01:16:15.903]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:16:15.903 --> 01:16:20.405]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bug, the organic wormwood.
[01:16:20.405 --> 01:16:23.687]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:16:23.687 --> 01:16:26.749]  All right, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:16:26.749 --> 01:16:27.810]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:16:27.810 --> 01:16:28.610]  Living Defense.

[01:16:36.714 --> 01:16:38.954]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:16:38.954 --> 01:16:42.135]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.

[01:16:46.536 --> 01:16:54.639]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[01:16:54.639 --> 01:16:59.280]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[01:16:59.913 --> 01:17:02.456]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[01:17:02.456 --> 01:17:06.680]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:09.803]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[01:17:09.803 --> 01:17:17.050]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high meat diets.
[01:17:17.050 --> 01:17:24.237]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[01:17:25.103 --> 01:17:32.290]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[01:17:32.290 --> 01:17:33.752]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[01:17:33.752 --> 01:17:36.395]  Use Carnivore by InfoWarsLife.

[01:17:45.524 --> 01:17:48.147]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:09.017]  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for joining us.
[01:18:09.017 --> 01:18:11.739]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, coming up in the next segment, Your Phone Calls.
[01:18:11.739 --> 01:18:15.162]  So continuing here, I'm a newshound.
[01:18:15.162 --> 01:18:16.463]  I've been a newshound for 25 years.
[01:18:16.463 --> 01:18:17.463]  I've been on air 22 years.
[01:18:17.463 --> 01:18:21.086]  And so I actually look at the statistics, and I talk to law enforcement, and I check into it.
[01:18:21.977 --> 01:18:31.803]  And so, that's why I've understood that, statistically, immigrants to this country, from all over the world, come here because they want to work, they want to be successful.
[01:18:31.803 --> 01:18:34.265]  Now, more and more though, you have people coming here to have anchor babies.
[01:18:34.265 --> 01:18:38.928]  So that's now not people from Mexico, that used to be the biggest group, it's now Chinese women.
[01:18:38.928 --> 01:18:45.552]  Thousands and thousands a week come here, middle class Chinese women, to have their baby for free, then the baby becomes a U.S.
[01:18:45.552 --> 01:18:48.313]  citizen, and now they have a toehold here in the U.S.
[01:18:48.313 --> 01:18:49.274]  We shouldn't have to pay for that.
[01:18:51.204 --> 01:19:05.911]  So again, we know the statistics piece by piece, and on average, the cliche that Hispanic workers out of Mexico, wherever, coming off farms down there, like farm boys used to, you know, come off farms, you know, here in the 50s and 60s.
[01:19:05.911 --> 01:19:07.131]  They have just been third world.
[01:19:07.131 --> 01:19:09.693]  They haven't been industrialized yet, so they're behind.
[01:19:09.693 --> 01:19:12.454]  Just like my grandfathers were good, hardworking guys that came off the farm.
[01:19:13.414 --> 01:19:17.837]  And, you know, nowadays, you know, people aren't as tough or strong or hard-working as their grandfathers.
[01:19:17.837 --> 01:19:19.458]  We've gotten decadent in America.
[01:19:19.458 --> 01:19:20.598]  So the cliché is true.
[01:19:20.598 --> 01:19:27.363]  Farm boys coming off a farm in Mexico are going to get the job done and usually aren't criminals.
[01:19:27.363 --> 01:19:31.265]  And, you know, they're more country boy than most folk guys in Texas.
[01:19:31.265 --> 01:19:36.108]  That's where cowboy hats and boots came from Spain and were then developed in Mexico and Chile.
[01:19:37.583 --> 01:19:51.887]  But there is a narco-terrorist culture and a gang culture and a drug culture in Latin America that is a minority, but particularly vicious, that creates a disproportionate amount of crime.
[01:19:51.887 --> 01:19:53.588]  And that's true.
[01:19:53.588 --> 01:19:57.149]  Just like black-on-black crime is stratospheric.
[01:19:57.149 --> 01:19:59.849]  These are demographic things that go on and are facts.
[01:19:59.849 --> 01:20:05.311]  So, yes, the average Hispanic person isn't some foaming-at-the-mouth criminal.
[01:20:05.311 --> 01:20:05.491]  But,
[01:20:06.491 --> 01:20:15.918]  There are criminal gangs coming in, and criminal groups, and mentally ill people, and serial killers, like the railway killer, that killed, they think, 40-something people?
[01:20:15.918 --> 01:20:18.060]  And he had all these different names and stuff?
[01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:19.661]  It's dangerous!
[01:20:19.661 --> 01:20:20.462]  And it's crazy!
[01:20:20.462 --> 01:20:26.927]  I mean, one of these crazy guys shoots a woman in the back, the liberal jury won't even do anything about it!
[01:20:26.927 --> 01:20:28.528]  And that's the issue.
[01:20:28.528 --> 01:20:33.091]  That's what's wrong with this, is that there's this thing where they're making people above the law.
[01:20:33.091 --> 01:20:33.932]  And the argument is, well,
[01:20:34.952 --> 01:20:37.294]  People from Latin America already won't call the police.
[01:20:37.294 --> 01:20:39.675]  They're already scared of the system and they're scared of repercussions.
[01:20:39.675 --> 01:20:40.356]  And that's true.
[01:20:40.356 --> 01:20:44.619]  Because in those countries, if you do report on the criminal gangs, they'll kill you.
[01:20:44.619 --> 01:20:47.641]  And that's where the real statistics are.
[01:20:47.641 --> 01:20:54.126]  It's much higher than even these statistics show because Hispanics on average report crime on the lowest levels out there.
[01:20:54.126 --> 01:20:55.206]  You can look it up.
[01:20:55.206 --> 01:20:57.488]  And so a lot of people just get disappeared.
[01:20:57.488 --> 01:20:59.750]  And by the way, who mainly gets disappeared?
[01:20:59.750 --> 01:21:01.571]  Who do gangs usually target mainly?
[01:21:01.571 --> 01:21:02.892]  Their own group.
[01:21:03.892 --> 01:21:10.115]  The worst thing for Hispanics in America are these undocumented criminal gangs, and they'll tell you that.
[01:21:10.115 --> 01:21:15.818]  But you go see a Robert Rodriguez movie, it's rednecks and cowboy hats shooting pregnant Mexicans in the stomach.
[01:21:15.818 --> 01:21:18.099]  Let me tell you who's raping and killing Mexicans.
[01:21:18.099 --> 01:21:22.821]  It's the drug cartels, and they've dug up hundreds of thousands, over 100,000 people.
[01:21:22.821 --> 01:21:25.943]  And almost all of them got killed by those satanic drug gangs.
[01:21:27.580 --> 01:21:28.601]  That's the facts!
[01:21:28.601 --> 01:21:32.463]  Robert Rodriguez, you are a Mexican supremacist racist!
[01:21:32.463 --> 01:21:34.124]  But you're not actually helping your people!
[01:21:34.124 --> 01:21:35.185]  You're not a real supremacist!
[01:21:35.185 --> 01:21:37.267]  You're not telling them don't take Gardasil or whatever!
[01:21:37.267 --> 01:21:40.108]  You're sitting there telling them the gringo's killing them!
[01:21:40.108 --> 01:21:45.032]  When the average gringo is a self-loathing, guilty wimp!
[01:21:45.032 --> 01:21:46.813]  And I'm sick of it!
[01:21:46.813 --> 01:21:48.874]  Your problem is not your local gringo!
[01:21:48.874 --> 01:21:50.596]  Your problem is the globalist!
[01:21:50.596 --> 01:21:52.317]  And your problem is Carlos Slim!
[01:21:52.317 --> 01:21:55.619]  And your problem is the big mega-combines that are controlling the society!
[01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:58.742]  And attacking our families and everybody.
[01:21:58.742 --> 01:22:03.025]  And your enemy is the abortuaries that are working as hard as they can to abort your kids.
[01:22:03.025 --> 01:22:05.828]  Am I a leftist trying to get the Hispanic kids aborted?
[01:22:05.828 --> 01:22:06.568]  Hell no!
[01:22:06.568 --> 01:22:07.989]  Am I trying to get the black kids aborted?
[01:22:07.989 --> 01:22:08.710]  No!
[01:22:08.710 --> 01:22:15.315]  Even though they're getting turned into weapons against me by the brainwashing machine, I'm chivalrous and I will not go to that level.
[01:22:15.315 --> 01:22:17.016]  But the real enemy is the globalists.
[01:22:17.016 --> 01:22:18.378]  That's all of our enemy.
[01:22:18.378 --> 01:22:23.562]  And Trump is bringing back prosperity for everybody if we want it.
[01:22:23.562 --> 01:22:23.722]  Now,
[01:22:24.884 --> 01:22:39.059]  Let's go ahead and play the rest here with Tucker Carlson, and then I'm going to go to break, and I'm going to come back and go to your calls, but I've got to get to some really sickening news that just went live on InfoWars.com with Kit Daniels.
[01:22:39.059 --> 01:22:42.262]  It is so incredible, but I'm not going to tell you about it until the next segment.
[01:22:42.262 --> 01:22:46.146]  Let's finish up with Tucker Carlson and the statistics, and it's worse than this.
[01:22:46.146 --> 01:22:47.288]  It's way worse than this.
[01:22:48.048 --> 01:22:51.630]  I mean, my God, the unmarked graves are digging up.
[01:22:51.630 --> 01:23:04.478]  90% of the time, there is a Hispanic woman, her kids in the grave, and it's because somebody back home didn't pay off, and it's sick, and they're treated like animals by the criminal class in Mexico, and I'm sick of it.
[01:23:04.478 --> 01:23:10.281]  That's why everybody should be armed in Mexico, they should have their own Second Amendment, they should have their own Reformation, and turn this around.
[01:23:10.281 --> 01:23:11.262]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[01:23:11.702 --> 01:23:15.045]  We now, for the first time, have the actual numbers, and here they are.
[01:23:15.045 --> 01:23:16.746]  According to statistics from the U.S.
[01:23:16.746 --> 01:23:23.712]  Sentencing Commission, non-citizens are actually far more likely to commit serious crimes than Americans are.
[01:23:23.712 --> 01:23:39.766]  Non-citizens account for 22%, more than a fifth, of all federal murder convictions, 18% of fraud convictions, 33% of money laundering convictions, 29% of drug trafficking convictions, and 72% of convictions for drug possession.
[01:23:40.891 --> 01:23:44.872]  Meanwhile, the non-citizen percentage of the American population?
[01:23:44.872 --> 01:23:46.513]  About 7%.
[01:23:46.513 --> 01:23:50.093]  So that is a massively disproportionate amount of crime.
[01:23:50.093 --> 01:23:51.374]  Not even close.
[01:23:51.374 --> 01:23:55.475]  No, immigrants are not more law-abiding and less dangerous than Americans.
[01:23:55.475 --> 01:23:57.155]  That's totally untrue.
[01:23:57.155 --> 01:23:59.656]  Indeed, it's the opposite of the truth.
[01:23:59.656 --> 01:24:06.178]  Non-citizens are more likely to be arrested, convicted, and imprisoned for serious crimes than people who were born here.
[01:24:06.178 --> 01:24:07.018]  Much more likely.
[01:24:08.189 --> 01:24:10.750]  So why didn't we know this until now?
[01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:15.833]  Why have so many people been lying to us about this for so long?
[01:24:15.833 --> 01:24:18.834]  That's a question we plan to ask a whole bunch of people.
[01:24:18.834 --> 01:24:20.395]  Alright, very powerful information.
[01:24:20.395 --> 01:24:21.616]  Extremely powerful.
[01:24:21.616 --> 01:24:25.758]  We're gonna go to break, come back to this Kit Daniels news that Daria brought to my attention.
[01:24:27.555 --> 01:24:31.918]  And then I'm going to go to your phone calls for the entire balance of the transmission today, on this Friday edition.
[01:24:31.918 --> 01:24:34.901]  We're going to take hours and hours of phone calls right into the fourth hour.
[01:24:34.901 --> 01:24:41.766]  We got Zack in Morocco, who we'll go to first, our military source on what's happening militarily around the world.
[01:24:41.766 --> 01:24:44.588]  Again, a source known to us, a big news-breaking source.
[01:24:44.588 --> 01:24:48.530]  And I've got the other article, Marine Corps General says we're about to have a big war.
[01:24:48.530 --> 01:24:50.032]  And I know it's in the stack, guys.
[01:24:50.032 --> 01:24:51.933]  Will you just reprint it for me?
[01:24:51.933 --> 01:24:53.054]  Thank you.
[01:24:53.054 --> 01:24:53.974]  So that's coming up.
[01:24:53.974 --> 01:24:54.535]  Just briefly,
[01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:59.414]  I want to thank the listeners for all they've done, making this broadcast possible.
[01:24:59.414 --> 01:25:03.657]  Without you, we wouldn't be here, and you've done it again.
[01:25:03.657 --> 01:25:08.642]  This December was better than last December for our funding.
[01:25:08.642 --> 01:25:21.393]  Not a lot bigger, but the fact that almost everybody else was contracted because last year was an election year, but that we have expanded, despite all the censorship, all the attacks, getting our sponsors, kicking us off Google Ads, despite all that,
[01:25:22.432 --> 01:25:27.021]  In 2017, we have now brought in more capital than we did in 2016.
[01:25:27.021 --> 01:25:29.205]  I salute you all, and I thank you.
[01:25:30.208 --> 01:25:33.029]  And we just crossed that line a few days ago.
[01:25:33.029 --> 01:25:50.078]  So I will be able to hopefully expand and hire another five, six reporters, more editors, more video people, finish out the new studio, buy more satellite time on TV, and reach out to UHF, VHF, and cable for the big expansion this year into a terrestrial television because of all the censorship we're facing on the internet.
[01:25:50.078 --> 01:25:53.340]  So I salute you, and despite all the attacks, thank you for the prayers.
[01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:57.822]  We made it through it so far by the grace of our Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.
[01:25:57.822 --> 01:25:59.783]  So again, all the praise goes to Christ.
[01:26:00.653 --> 01:26:02.955]  And all the thanks goes, again, to God.
[01:26:02.955 --> 01:26:08.158]  And I just want to ask you all to commit to help fortify and help us move forward.

[01:27:52.478 --> 01:27:58.741]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[01:28:00.522 --> 01:28:07.665]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.

[01:28:52.077 --> 01:28:54.220]  Sick and stupid.
[01:28:54.220 --> 01:28:55.581]  So what do we do about it?
[01:28:55.581 --> 01:28:58.925]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.

[01:29:28.794 --> 01:29:30.595]  Op-op-op-op-optimum levels.
[01:29:52.603 --> 01:29:57.245]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[01:29:57.245 --> 01:29:59.606]  O-O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[01:29:59.606 --> 01:30:01.366]  B vitamins we need every day.

[01:30:22.734 --> 01:30:27.915]  B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system.
[01:30:27.915 --> 01:30:28.656]  Optimum levels.
[01:30:30.076 --> 01:30:34.239]  Secret 12 is an easy way to increase your vitamin B12 intake.

[01:30:39.402 --> 01:30:45.505]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:30:45.505 --> 01:30:48.687]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:30:48.687 --> 01:30:53.590]  Woo!
[01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:54.210]  Yeah!
[01:30:59.605 --> 01:31:02.187]  The Republic is back!
[01:31:02.187 --> 01:31:04.768]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:31:04.768 --> 01:31:11.993]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:31:11.993 --> 01:31:16.236]  We are the resistance to the globalists and their worldwide corporate tyranny.
[01:31:16.236 --> 01:31:22.940]  And we are well on our way to restoring our Republic with our prosperity, our Bill of Rights, our Constitution, and so much more.
[01:31:24.719 --> 01:31:27.221]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am your host Alex Jones.
[01:31:27.221 --> 01:31:32.805]  Infowars.com and Newswars.com are the main sites.
[01:31:32.805 --> 01:31:41.070]  We're going to be talking to Zach in Morocco, who's a great military source for us about big breaking news in a moment.
[01:31:41.070 --> 01:31:45.433]  And then I will go to your calls.
[01:31:45.433 --> 01:31:51.757]  And then we'll break down the big article in the Army Times with the top Marine General saying war is basically imminent.
[01:31:51.757 --> 01:31:53.899]  Top Marine General, there's a war coming.
[01:31:55.251 --> 01:31:58.614]  So, that's also in the Hill, it's also in the Army Times, you name it.
[01:31:58.614 --> 01:32:02.137]  It is big news, ladies and gentlemen, and that is where all this is going.
[01:32:02.137 --> 01:32:08.782]  So as great as I think Trump is, and as much as I like what's happening, I do not like the direction we're going on this front.
[01:32:08.782 --> 01:32:13.906]  So we'll be talking about that with Zach and others coming up.
[01:32:13.906 --> 01:32:22.633]  First off, ladies and gentlemen, every time I cover these issues, the media comes out and misrepresents what I've said.
[01:32:23.533 --> 01:32:30.498]  I don't want heterosexual, I don't want homosexual, I don't want anything sexual being taught to children.
[01:32:30.498 --> 01:32:35.582]  If they want to have health class, you know, in the 7th, 8th grade, teach them about the mechanics of the body, fine.
[01:32:35.582 --> 01:32:41.107]  But parents that didn't want that decades ago knew where the sexualization of children angle was leading.
[01:32:41.107 --> 01:32:50.574]  Give them a textbook, whatever, but don't sit there and have the system getting involved in the reproductive system of our children.
[01:32:51.457 --> 01:32:55.058]  The state's always been obsessed with this as a tool of social control.
[01:32:55.058 --> 01:33:10.342]  And last week I covered Discovery Channel, History Channel, and other shows about this new big trend of hundreds of new acronyms, of new sexual designations, and so many things I said.
[01:33:10.342 --> 01:33:11.342]  It's PQLGL39QX59QLPLZ.
[01:33:15.504 --> 01:33:23.791]  There's people having sex with their automobiles now, and appliances, and that's a huge new fetish thing that's growing on TV, I've seen.
[01:33:23.791 --> 01:33:27.034]  It's all being pushed to break up the family.
[01:33:27.034 --> 01:33:28.035]  The globalists admit that.
[01:33:28.035 --> 01:33:29.176]  I mean, it's a fact.
[01:33:29.176 --> 01:33:32.458]  It doesn't, you know, even judging people, as long as they're consenting adults.
[01:33:32.458 --> 01:33:39.144]  This is an admitted program, and the estrogen mimickers, and all of it, and the social engineers don't want to have a real debate about this.
[01:33:39.144 --> 01:33:42.587]  So, we then see things
[01:33:43.502 --> 01:33:48.585]  Put out by Disney like Feminist Baby that says you can be a boy or a girl.
[01:33:48.585 --> 01:33:52.527]  And then it's got a weird image of the baby naked when you first open it up.
[01:33:52.527 --> 01:33:55.129]  I mean, it's all this sexualization of children.
[01:33:55.129 --> 01:33:56.970]  That's sold in Target.
[01:33:56.970 --> 01:34:06.455]  And then Camille Paglia, who's a classical liberal and a lesbian, came out and points out that transgender propagandists are committing child abuse.
[01:34:07.512 --> 01:34:12.133]  I mean, they're going into five-year-olds and telling them, you're not really a boy, you're not really a girl.
[01:34:12.133 --> 01:34:19.056]  And kids think it's like playtime, like playing they're a fireman, or playing they're, you know, a police person, or whatever.
[01:34:19.056 --> 01:34:23.897]  And then, they go, here, now, here's your fake genitals.
[01:34:23.897 --> 01:34:25.498]  Wear this, you're now a boy.
[01:34:25.498 --> 01:34:26.278]  Or, you're now a girl.
[01:34:26.278 --> 01:34:32.780]  Let's dress a boy as a girl, and teach him how to tuck it between his legs, and let's teach a girl she's a boy.
[01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:35.001]  So the article is up on InfoWars.com.
[01:34:38.949 --> 01:34:45.494]  Little Transgender Shop sells fake genitals for little girls.
[01:34:45.494 --> 01:34:49.236]  Stand to pee.
[01:34:49.236 --> 01:34:49.697]  Genitals.
[01:34:50.566 --> 01:34:56.007]  The p-word, designed for ages 8 to 13, Storr proudly declares.
[01:34:56.007 --> 01:35:03.470]  I won't even say the name, because YouTube will use it to age-restrict it so I can't warn people if I say what they're going to teach three-year-olds.
[01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:04.310]  You understand?
[01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:16.233]  I can't say to you on talk radio or on YouTube what they're doing to children because it might hurt children, but they're doing it to children.
[01:35:16.233 --> 01:35:19.814]  The mother of a young transgender is selling fake genitals for little girls.
[01:35:21.323 --> 01:35:22.524]  Fake Johnson's.
[01:35:22.524 --> 01:35:41.558]  Her website, transkids.biz, offers products ranging from tiny silicone male genitals, in circumcised and uncircumcised models, genitals, pack holders, so little cars, little dolls, you have a little pack holder, and transgender books for kids.
[01:35:41.558 --> 01:35:44.020]  A girl like any other.
[01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:46.602]  Backwards Day, teaching you to be a girl.
[01:35:46.602 --> 01:35:48.924]  Princess of Great Darling.
[01:35:51.445 --> 01:35:59.354]  Trans Kids is run by Sarah who also runs a site for trans guys called FT... I can't even pronounce this.
[01:35:59.354 --> 01:36:07.503]  Says the About Us page featuring a pink-haired proprietor after years of helping adults find high-quality gender expression gear.
[01:36:07.503 --> 01:36:11.407]  She saw the need for a site and a store that focused more on kids.
[01:36:12.446 --> 01:36:13.947]  And their unique needs, yeah.
[01:36:13.947 --> 01:36:19.248]  It's kinda like, I owned a liquor store and sold to adults at 21, but now I'm gonna sell liquor directly to kids.
[01:36:19.248 --> 01:36:23.210]  If you wanna sell this to adults, lady, knock yourself out!
[01:36:23.210 --> 01:36:24.750]  Stay away from kids!
[01:36:24.750 --> 01:36:27.311]  Stay away!
[01:36:27.311 --> 01:36:31.692]  Sarah is also the parent, this is what Camille Paglia talks about, can you imagine?
[01:36:31.692 --> 01:36:34.073]  Is also the parent of a young transgender girl.
[01:36:34.073 --> 01:36:37.654]  So she has a son that she's taught to be a boy.
[01:36:37.654 --> 01:36:39.115]  Or she's got a son she's taught to be a girl.
[01:36:39.858 --> 01:36:40.819]  How much do you believe this?
[01:36:40.819 --> 01:36:46.541]  Sarah is also the parent of a young transgender girl, so she hopes... You're not supposed to use the word girl.
[01:36:46.541 --> 01:36:48.502]  Oh, but see, they define what words you use.
[01:36:48.502 --> 01:36:49.202]  They can use it.
[01:36:49.202 --> 01:37:01.948]  Sarah is also the parent of a young transgender girl, so she hopes that all parents coming here can trust this is a safe and affirming place where helping your kids live fully is our main goal.
[01:37:01.948 --> 01:37:07.511]  The fake genitals are designed for ages 8 to 13 according to their product page.
[01:37:08.490 --> 01:37:12.551]  This is the smallest stand-to-pee device that we have seen.
[01:37:12.551 --> 01:37:21.814]  It states, designed especially for younger folks, 8 to 13 years old, these are discreet enough that they can be worn all day under the clothes.
[01:37:21.814 --> 01:37:28.236]  If your child was assigned a female at birth that wants to stand up while urinating, this just might work great for them.
[01:37:29.255 --> 01:37:30.636]  And then we've got the images of it.
[01:37:30.636 --> 01:37:34.617]  I mean, this is the bizarre perversion, the weirdness, the mass mental illness.
[01:37:34.617 --> 01:37:40.419]  It's like all over the UK and the US, they're now paying to have their eyes removed or Drano poured in their eyes.
[01:37:40.419 --> 01:37:44.881]  And the taxpayers will pay for you to be blind because you identify as a blind person.
[01:37:44.881 --> 01:37:47.782]  That's mental illness.
[01:37:47.782 --> 01:37:50.563]  People are now identifying as dogs.
[01:37:50.563 --> 01:37:54.024]  The store underscores how young children are increasingly being
[01:37:54.873 --> 01:38:00.714]  Pressured to reconsider their gender identity, which critics have blasted as a form of child abuse.
[01:38:00.714 --> 01:38:02.795]  And then that's Camille Paglia talking about it.
[01:38:02.795 --> 01:38:04.515]  But there's another factor at play.
[01:38:04.515 --> 01:38:20.179]  Estrogen mimickers in household goods and grocery stores and groceries, especially bisphenol A in plastics and atrazine, as well as foods, highly processed with soy ingredients, both of which are said to contribute to the low testosterone soy boy pandemic.
[01:38:21.218 --> 01:38:28.901]  Bisphenol A, BPA in particular, is known as a gender-bending chemical because of its link to male impotence and low sperm counts.
[01:38:28.901 --> 01:38:39.766]  Yeah, me and my son were driving to work this morning, because he's off because of Christmas, and I saw one of those little mini cars, the British one, I forget the name, and
[01:38:40.985 --> 01:38:43.186]  It had a pink license plate and said, resist.
[01:38:43.186 --> 01:38:44.827]  And I said, wait, it's going to be a soy boy.
[01:38:44.827 --> 01:38:48.770]  We drove by the guy looked like a concentration camp victim.
[01:38:48.770 --> 01:38:52.572]  And every time you see it, I mean, they are just totally leaderless.
[01:38:52.572 --> 01:38:53.293]  They have no idea.
[01:38:53.293 --> 01:38:54.473]  They're totally confused.
[01:38:54.473 --> 01:39:02.398]  They just glom onto media, glom onto the bots that tell them, have a pink license plate, you know, drive the little mini car.
[01:39:02.398 --> 01:39:06.261]  And again, if one person was doing it or 10 people or a thousand, it's a cult.
[01:39:07.541 --> 01:39:14.091]  Adrogen mimickers increase adrogen activity in young men, leading to social anxiety and bitch tits, that's what they're medically called.
[01:39:14.091 --> 01:39:20.801]  So it's really not surprising there's a generation of celibate hipsters running around in skinny jeans who are scared to death of the first
[01:39:22.282 --> 01:39:23.903]  Of fish fights and women.
[01:39:23.903 --> 01:39:24.623]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:39:24.623 --> 01:39:25.224]  And it's been done.
[01:39:25.224 --> 01:39:36.510]  So here's the website, Trans Kids, and this is what's being pushed in the schools, it's what's being pushed with the sexualization, with drag queens at the schools and kids pole dancing and giving drag queens money.
[01:39:36.510 --> 01:39:44.174]  I mean, you wouldn't have a heterosexual, a woman in there pole dancing and three-year-olds and five-year-olds handing them cash.
[01:39:44.174 --> 01:39:45.715]  That's for topless bars.
[01:39:45.715 --> 01:39:47.756]  Stop sexualizing children.
[01:39:47.756 --> 01:39:48.577]  Stop doing it.
[01:39:50.251 --> 01:39:54.852]  It's child abuse, just like Camille Paglia said, and it's all about the sexualization of children.
[01:39:54.852 --> 01:40:08.034]  It's an agenda of Hollywood and the globalists, and it's meant to break up our families and make us leaderless and absolutely in the male and the female, biologically, under the THX 1138 Brave New World program of UNESCO and the UN, which is documented, admitted.
[01:40:08.034 --> 01:40:08.995]  Look up Atrazine.
[01:40:08.995 --> 01:40:10.095]  Look it all up for yourself.
[01:40:10.095 --> 01:40:16.836]  We're going to go to break and come back with Zach in Morocco with his latest information, and then all of your phone calls through this hour right into the next.
[01:40:17.660 --> 01:40:18.361]  Speak out.
[01:40:18.361 --> 01:40:19.121]  Say no to this.
[01:40:19.121 --> 01:40:20.602]  Be aware of it and understand.
[01:40:20.602 --> 01:40:24.965]  The parents doing this to young children, in my view, are abusing them.
[01:40:24.965 --> 01:40:26.186]  This is abusive.
[01:40:26.186 --> 01:40:27.367]  It's bizarre.
[01:40:27.367 --> 01:40:28.487]  It's sick.
[01:40:28.487 --> 01:40:29.488]  We'll be right back.
[01:40:29.488 --> 01:40:31.610]  Stop experimenting on your children.
[01:40:31.610 --> 01:40:34.051]  But after all, we're all in a big experiment right now.
[01:40:34.051 --> 01:40:34.892]  Under globalism.
[01:40:34.892 --> 01:40:38.014]  We're under chemical, biological, cultural and spiritual attack.
[01:40:38.014 --> 01:40:38.434]  Wake up.
[01:40:38.434 --> 01:40:39.075]  Resist.
[01:40:39.075 --> 01:40:39.515]  We will win.
[01:40:41.771 --> 01:40:46.913]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[01:40:46.913 --> 01:40:51.695]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[01:40:51.695 --> 01:40:59.979]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[01:41:00.379 --> 01:41:03.880]  This is critical, because stomach acid kills most probiotics.
[01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:09.121]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[01:41:09.121 --> 01:41:16.422]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[01:41:16.422 --> 01:41:20.323]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[01:41:20.323 --> 01:41:25.043]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[01:41:25.043 --> 01:41:28.504]  Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care.
[01:41:28.944 --> 01:41:33.147]  And a 50 billion probiotic for a 30-day advanced gut restoration program.
[01:41:33.147 --> 01:41:36.610]  Head to infowarslife.com to pick up your bottle of Fluor Life probiotic
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:47.628]  Choose to take control of your chemistry with Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium.
[01:41:47.628 --> 01:41:51.993]  This powerful combo is perfect for supporting your thyroid and health.
[01:41:51.993 --> 01:41:57.380]  BioTrue Selenium's formula is far from synthetic and is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[01:41:59.262 --> 01:42:07.908]  Our super high quality nascent iodine is an essential mineral sourced of 99.99% ultra pure deep earth iodine crystals.
[01:42:07.908 --> 01:42:15.694]  This essential mineral is necessary in order to produce thyroid hormones which influence every cell, tissue and organ in the body.
[01:42:15.694 --> 01:42:22.499]  With inadequate thyroid hormones you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight gain and overall brain fog.
[01:42:22.819 --> 01:42:25.780]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:42:25.780 --> 01:42:26.120]  Go ahead.
[01:42:45.189 --> 01:42:47.130]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:42:47.130 --> 01:42:56.454]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:42:57.316 --> 01:43:04.098]  And as a long-time InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[01:43:04.098 --> 01:43:06.338]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[01:43:06.338 --> 01:43:07.399]  Thank you.
[01:43:07.399 --> 01:43:09.899]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[01:43:09.899 --> 01:43:14.220]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[01:43:14.220 --> 01:43:17.241]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[01:43:17.241 --> 01:43:18.542]  They are quality.
[01:43:18.542 --> 01:43:20.282]  I can't wait to get some more.
[01:43:20.282 --> 01:43:23.163]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[01:43:23.163 --> 01:43:23.703]  Absolutely.
[01:43:24.244 --> 01:43:37.138]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:43:41.793 --> 01:43:44.756]  Top scientists and researchers agree.
[01:43:44.756 --> 01:43:53.906]  We are being hit by toxic weapons in the food and water supply that are making us fat, sick, and stupid.
[01:43:53.906 --> 01:43:55.267]  So what do we do about it?
[01:43:55.267 --> 01:43:58.631]  Well, for starters, don't just sit there and take it.
[01:43:58.631 --> 01:44:04.437]  Fight back with the all-new supercharged Brain Force Plus and feel the rush.
[01:44:05.091 --> 01:44:06.352]  Without the crash.
[01:44:06.352 --> 01:44:12.594]  RainForce Plus is the next generation of advanced neural activation and nootropics.
[01:44:12.594 --> 01:44:18.516]  And now we've added a brand new ingredient called Black Pepper Fruit Extracts.
[01:44:18.516 --> 01:44:21.338]  It gives you an added kick.
[01:44:21.338 --> 01:44:22.258]  Other ingredients.
[01:44:22.798 --> 01:44:25.541]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:45:04.967 --> 01:45:11.232]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:45:11.232 --> 01:45:14.315]  You mark my words!
[01:45:14.315 --> 01:45:24.042]  YouTube, Facebook, and others are either going to take the video down when I upload this, or say it's age-restricted because that's how they keep the public from learning what's going on with the children.
[01:45:24.042 --> 01:45:25.804]  It's all an agenda.
[01:45:25.804 --> 01:45:30.688]  They can go into three and four and five-year-olds in public schools and tell them, you're a little girl if you're a boy.
[01:45:30.688 --> 01:45:31.008]  You're a
[01:45:31.897 --> 01:45:33.338]  You're a boy if you're a little girl.
[01:45:33.338 --> 01:45:35.159]  You're a girl if you're a little boy.
[01:45:35.159 --> 01:45:40.322]  And vice versa, as Camille Paglia says, serious child abuse.
[01:45:40.322 --> 01:45:47.727]  But then, if we even try to show you what they publicly put on the website, we'll have our website shut down.
[01:45:47.727 --> 01:45:57.794]  So we have it blurred out here, but notice the little transgender books they're giving the kids, and the fake prosthetic genitals for little girls, they show it in the hand.
[01:45:59.255 --> 01:46:06.540]  Now, again, the hand on the image of the prosthesis of the artificial genital.
[01:46:06.540 --> 01:46:09.422]  And again, that's what's on their actual site, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:09.422 --> 01:46:13.085]  And people will say, hey, it's okay to have adults tell little kids about this.
[01:46:13.085 --> 01:46:16.587]  Just don't show adults on YouTube or other children.
[01:46:16.587 --> 01:46:18.149]  Good Lord!
[01:46:18.149 --> 01:46:19.029]  Get it off the screen.
[01:46:19.029 --> 01:46:21.191]  I can't look at it anymore.
[01:46:21.191 --> 01:46:22.912]  And this is how little girls can urinate.
[01:46:23.965 --> 01:46:28.329]  And the parents can go in and say it's your choice at age four whether you want to be a boy or girl.
[01:46:28.329 --> 01:46:36.195]  You can't go into a child and say it's your choice if you want to take PCP, or drink a bottle of Jack Daniels, or if you want to take inoculations, or if you want to date the next door neighbor.
[01:46:36.195 --> 01:46:38.377]  You're not at the age of consent!
[01:46:38.377 --> 01:46:40.099]  This is abuse!
[01:46:40.099 --> 01:46:41.200]  Cut and dry!
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:44.903]  And Google, and Facebook, and Twitter are all there pushing it!
[01:46:45.808 --> 01:46:55.014]  And it's not hate of someone that thinks they're another sex, it's the hate of pushing garbage, whether it's heterosexual, homosexual, whatever it is, on children.
[01:46:55.014 --> 01:46:57.075]  Leave the children alone!
[01:46:57.075 --> 01:46:58.796]  Hey!
[01:46:58.796 --> 01:46:59.717]  Teacher!
[01:46:59.717 --> 01:47:00.977]  Leave them kids alone!
[01:47:00.977 --> 01:47:02.458]  Hey!
[01:47:02.458 --> 01:47:03.359]  Nambla!
[01:47:03.359 --> 01:47:04.600]  Leave them kids alone!
[01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:11.364]  Because all in all, it's gonna be another brick in the wall, and the rebellion against what you've done is gonna be massive.
[01:47:11.923 --> 01:47:18.067]  And Generation X, Generation Y, Generation Z, all the rest of it as humanity awakens.
[01:47:18.067 --> 01:47:18.728]  I'm done ranting.
[01:47:18.728 --> 01:47:20.489]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:47:20.489 --> 01:47:22.530]  I saw this this morning as they were writing the article about it.
[01:47:22.530 --> 01:47:23.951]  It upset me the last hour.
[01:47:23.951 --> 01:47:24.792]  I just bit my tongue.
[01:47:24.792 --> 01:47:25.952]  I'm so mad.
[01:47:25.952 --> 01:47:27.894]  Leave the kids alone, for heaven's sakes!
[01:47:27.894 --> 01:47:29.155]  You freaks!
[01:47:29.155 --> 01:47:31.076]  God Almighty!
[01:47:31.076 --> 01:47:35.539]  Heterosexual, homosexual, it's all called pedophilia when you target kids.
[01:47:35.539 --> 01:47:36.960]  So knock it off!
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:39.942]  The whole branding of this, and a lot of liberals, they want to social
[01:47:40.794 --> 01:47:42.815]  Virtue Signal with every new thing.
[01:47:42.815 --> 01:47:43.896]  So they're not into this stuff.
[01:47:43.896 --> 01:48:01.347]  They just, okay, Muslims aren't terrorists, and cutting women's genitals off is liberal, and throwing gays off buildings in Islam is good, and sexualizing small children is good, and, you know, because I'm in a Virtue Signal, I'm in a Virtue Signal, I'm in a Virtue Signal, just like me, just like me, just like me, and you're these alone nobodies.
[01:48:01.347 --> 01:48:07.791]  The leftists always walk up and go, boo, boo, boo, knock my drink over, whatever, everybody hates you, don't you feel ashamed?
[01:48:07.791 --> 01:48:09.693]  And I just bask like it's the sun, I go,
[01:48:10.573 --> 01:48:18.880]  Quite proud of taking America back, and the world's next, and we're turning things around, and praising the family, and free market, and Jesus Christ, and how you like that?
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:23.463]  And they just go, yeah, I'm not like you.
[01:48:23.463 --> 01:48:25.285]  I'm not like you people.
[01:48:25.285 --> 01:48:28.387]  I'm not an empty person that's off what other people think about me.
[01:48:28.387 --> 01:48:30.168]  I've got something in me.
[01:48:30.168 --> 01:48:31.710]  Understand?
[01:48:31.710 --> 01:48:32.290]  In me.
[01:48:32.290 --> 01:48:33.551]  Right here, right here, and right here.
[01:48:33.551 --> 01:48:34.832]  Right here.
[01:48:34.832 --> 01:48:35.292]  Three spots.
[01:48:35.292 --> 01:48:35.833]  Boom, boom, boom.
[01:48:35.833 --> 01:48:36.874]  Right here.
[01:48:36.874 --> 01:48:38.555]  That's what I go off of feels good there.
[01:48:39.381 --> 01:48:40.261]  It's called a conscience.
[01:48:40.261 --> 01:48:41.782]  It's called my wiring.
[01:48:41.782 --> 01:48:43.002]  I fall at that!
[01:48:43.002 --> 01:48:43.862]  My wiring!
[01:48:43.862 --> 01:48:45.523]  You haven't got to my wiring yet!
[01:48:45.523 --> 01:48:47.983]  You're trying to get to everybody else's wiring, but you're gonna fail!
[01:48:47.983 --> 01:48:49.684]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up and do all these calls.
[01:48:49.684 --> 01:48:50.924]  So we got them loaded up.
[01:48:50.924 --> 01:48:57.126]  Phil, Kevin, John, Rich, Deborah, Eugene, Jeff, Louis, Corey, we're gonna go to all of you.
[01:48:57.126 --> 01:48:57.846]  Thank you for holding.
[01:48:57.846 --> 01:48:58.546]  Thank you for calling in.
[01:48:58.546 --> 01:48:59.687]  We're gonna get to you.
[01:48:59.687 --> 01:49:02.747]  On the future of Trump, all the big promises coming through.
[01:49:02.747 --> 01:49:04.128]  How will the globalists strike back?
[01:49:04.128 --> 01:49:06.608]  New York Times saying that, you know, the coup's going on.
[01:49:06.608 --> 01:49:07.309]  We're gonna talk about it all.
[01:49:07.309 --> 01:49:08.489]  But Zach in Morocco,
[01:49:09.341 --> 01:49:13.422]  Hasn't given a secret info, but he's been in Army Special Operations and Intelligence.
[01:49:13.422 --> 01:49:14.623]  He's actually known.
[01:49:14.623 --> 01:49:15.483]  He's been in the news.
[01:49:15.483 --> 01:49:16.603]  We know who he is.
[01:49:16.603 --> 01:49:19.244]  He's not ready to go public yet, but he gets through on the line.
[01:49:19.244 --> 01:49:22.966]  We should just call Zach routinely, once a week, get updates, not just make him fight to get on the line.
[01:49:22.966 --> 01:49:23.606]  That's my fault.
[01:49:23.606 --> 01:49:25.106]  Should have thought of that.
[01:49:25.106 --> 01:49:29.448]  But, Zach, over there in Morocco, what do you make of the latest info?
[01:49:29.448 --> 01:49:31.889]  And Top Marine General says there's a war coming.
[01:49:31.889 --> 01:49:32.829]  That's in the Hill newspaper.
[01:49:34.962 --> 01:49:39.406]  Yes, Alex, it's great to be back on and I just had to connect some dots here.
[01:49:39.406 --> 01:49:51.437]  Everything you've laid out is pretty accurate so far, but I just wanted to connect some dots about the deep state death hurdle that will commence on the eve of Christmas into the new year because they are going to go for broke.
[01:49:51.437 --> 01:49:54.960]  With that being said, we need to start out with some key information.
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:57.482]  Last time when myself
[01:49:58.456 --> 01:50:08.241]  And you were on, we brought up the HRC, Huma Abedin, Barack Hussein connection, that set off some alarm bells, and everybody knows what's gone on there with the researchers.
[01:50:08.241 --> 01:50:25.511]  Now, I'm going to drop some information that will make the Snowden stuff look like snowflakes compared to the avalanche that I'm about to unleash, because the stuff I'm privy to is very important, and at this point, this is a duty to kind of relay it, so I'm going to go ahead and do that here.
[01:50:25.511 --> 01:50:27.652]  You know, when it comes to this Fast and Furious thing,
[01:50:28.413 --> 01:50:34.955]  When it comes to this radical Islamic thing, let's look at one individual in particular, which will bring it all down.
[01:50:34.955 --> 01:50:38.576]  That individual's name is Anwar al-Awlaki.
[01:50:38.576 --> 01:50:54.642]  Anwar al-Awlaki, the American, the New Mexico born, Colorado State educated, George Washington University educated, Anwar al-Awlaki, the influencer of Major Nidal Hassan at Fort Hood.
[01:50:54.642 --> 01:50:57.823]  That Anwar al-Awlaki is a major point in this.
[01:50:58.786 --> 01:51:01.486]  This Islamic threat is fabricated.
[01:51:01.486 --> 01:51:10.688]  You know, you have the FBI and you have the NSA, days after the attack at Fort Hood, coming out and saying, wow, he was talking with Anwar al-Awlaki.
[01:51:10.688 --> 01:51:12.308]  But let me get this straight.
[01:51:12.308 --> 01:51:17.189]  You have this information two to three days after this Fort Hood massacre there.
[01:51:17.189 --> 01:51:19.389]  How would you have that information two to three days later?
[01:51:19.389 --> 01:51:23.030]  Well, a letter came out that the CIA knew he was talking to him for two years.
[01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:28.031]  Oh, well, not only talking to him, they've presented Anwar al-Awlaki as a Yemeni cleric.
[01:51:28.860 --> 01:51:31.422]  Who is inciting violence in the United States.
[01:51:31.422 --> 01:51:34.185]  No, Anwar al-Awlaki was born in New Mexico.
[01:51:34.185 --> 01:51:36.988]  Anwar al-Awlaki was an intellectual.
[01:51:36.988 --> 01:51:43.033]  Anwar al-Awlaki was educated at the University in Colorado State in George Washington.
[01:51:43.033 --> 01:51:44.595]  George Washington University.
[01:51:44.595 --> 01:51:45.996]  This is critical.
[01:51:45.996 --> 01:51:47.777]  Okay, this is very critical.
[01:51:47.777 --> 01:51:50.220]  Because this was all a setup.
[01:51:50.220 --> 01:51:51.761]  And they went too far here.
[01:51:51.761 --> 01:51:52.542]  And I witnessed it.
[01:51:53.584 --> 01:52:13.093]  So this is all going on while Fast and Furious is going on, where they're taking weapons from Fort Bliss in El Paso, moving them across the border, into the Kingdom of Morocco, through the Sahara, in Algeria, eventually making their way to Libya, where they will defeat Gaddafi's reign there, and create ISIS.
[01:52:13.093 --> 01:52:14.914]  So this is deep.
[01:52:14.914 --> 01:52:19.156]  That's what Tosh Plumley, the CIA whistleblower, said here.
[01:52:19.156 --> 01:52:21.057]  Was his info he broke down accurate from what you know?
[01:52:22.017 --> 01:52:26.438]  Yeah, it was pretty accurate, but I was witness to it.
[01:52:26.438 --> 01:52:27.659]  I know exactly what happened there.
[01:52:27.659 --> 01:52:29.159]  And it's not a secret.
[01:52:29.159 --> 01:52:43.003]  People blew the whistle in Morocco and the DST commander in Morocco... So just to boil it down, why was Obama arming the Muslim Brotherhood and arming radical jihadists to destabilize moderate Muslim states?
[01:52:43.003 --> 01:52:43.483]  Right.
[01:52:43.483 --> 01:52:48.344]  So destabilizing moderate Muslim states and also creating ISIS to wreak havoc as we see in the world today.
[01:52:49.207 --> 01:52:57.389]  So this is not a blind eye, this is black ops, this was CIA, this was funded by the highest powers that be reigning in our country at the time.
[01:52:57.389 --> 01:52:59.230]  So this is why this is so critical.
[01:52:59.230 --> 01:53:05.871]  I mean, you know, we do have a radical Islamic threat, but we need to realize where the funding comes from and who's really involved.
[01:53:05.871 --> 01:53:08.452]  And it's the left and it's the deep state, without question.
[01:53:09.887 --> 01:53:23.095]  Absolutely, that's what the evidence shows, and it appears Trump is trying to actually cut that off and end that, and make deals to actually try to stabilize the Middle East again, but that McMaster and others are double-crossing, still trying to go back to the old game right under Trump's nose.
[01:53:23.095 --> 01:53:27.297]  It's absolutely unbelievable, and since the Trump administration has, you know, been in office,
[01:53:28.533 --> 01:53:34.014]  Since some of the power positions have changed, we've seen incredible changes reach around the world.
[01:53:34.014 --> 01:53:46.317]  I'm just saying, by first-hand information, when this information actually comes out, and I'm kind of hitting at some things without getting into anything very classified, but, you know, Fast and Furious was ran by our country.
[01:53:46.317 --> 01:53:48.377]  Fast and Furious is what created ISIS.
[01:53:48.377 --> 01:53:49.377]  There's just no way around it.
[01:53:49.377 --> 01:53:50.458]  This just wasn't Saws.
[01:53:50.458 --> 01:53:51.258]  This just wasn't M4s.
[01:53:53.297 --> 01:53:57.281]  This was shorter fired weapons, this was artillery, this was everything.
[01:53:57.281 --> 01:53:58.542]  This was a standing up of ISIS.
[01:53:58.542 --> 01:54:03.766]  Sure, and that was Obama and the EU and the globalists from all our research and our sources.
[01:54:03.766 --> 01:54:08.030]  Now you see the info coming out about arming Hezbollah as well.
[01:54:08.030 --> 01:54:11.694]  I mean, why is that suddenly coming out in all places politico?
[01:54:11.694 --> 01:54:16.538]  Well, that's coming out and also what's coming out is sort of this UFO leaking and some of this other technology leaking because
[01:54:17.182 --> 01:54:27.504]  What's essentially coming out is some of our deepest, I guess, quote-unquote secrets of what's going on, because what we're going to see, and you hinted to it earlier as we got on the phone, there will be a strike on North Korea.
[01:54:27.504 --> 01:54:31.325]  I've been calling you and talking to you about this for six months, the ending of strategic patience.
[01:54:31.325 --> 01:54:39.687]  There will be an attack there, and the real issue there is people think about the collateral damage and what will occur there, but it will be sophisticated.
[01:54:39.687 --> 01:54:41.347]  We will unleash weapons that we do
[01:54:42.378 --> 01:54:47.741]  Currently have, that have been field tested, but will actually be using conventional warfare for the first time.
[01:54:47.741 --> 01:54:52.403]  These will be EMP, these will be strategic nuclear weapons, this will be all of it.
[01:54:52.403 --> 01:54:58.346]  And I did start the call out by saying, on the eve of Christmas, I'm dubbing it the Deep State Death Hurdle.
[01:54:58.346 --> 01:54:59.407]  They're red-handed.
[01:54:59.407 --> 01:55:03.489]  The information that I just laid out is damning, and this is nothing special.
[01:55:03.489 --> 01:55:05.050]  It's going to come out.
[01:55:05.050 --> 01:55:06.571]  It's going to come out.
[01:55:06.571 --> 01:55:09.052]  Before they said the NSA wasn't spying, it comes out they're spying.
[01:55:09.887 --> 01:55:11.809]  Before they said, no, we didn't arm ISIS.
[01:55:11.809 --> 01:55:13.231]  No, you did arm ISIS.
[01:55:13.231 --> 01:55:15.133]  Now the House of Cards is following.
[01:55:15.133 --> 01:55:16.815]  They are desperate.
[01:55:16.815 --> 01:55:18.456]  And is it not Donald Trump for real?
[01:55:18.456 --> 01:55:20.138]  I mean, that's why they're so scared?
[01:55:20.138 --> 01:55:20.879]  Oh, it's for real.
[01:55:20.879 --> 01:55:22.080]  This is history in the making.
[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:24.483]  This is as sensational as it can be.
[01:55:24.483 --> 01:55:25.324]  Stay right there.
[01:55:25.324 --> 01:55:27.827]  Let's come right back and finish up with Zach and all your other calls.
[01:55:27.827 --> 01:55:28.327]  Stay with us.
[01:55:28.327 --> 01:55:28.808]  Third Hour.
[01:55:28.808 --> 01:55:29.709]  Please spread the links, folks.
[01:55:46.019 --> 01:55:51.121]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:55:51.121 --> 01:56:00.523]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:56:00.523 --> 01:56:06.865]  I'm getting some shocking information from Dr. Jerome Corsi with his connections in the White House.
[01:56:07.731 --> 01:56:14.013]  Of why Schmidt has stepped down, and I know it's because Schmidt's been a globalist and an Obama creature.
[01:56:14.013 --> 01:56:21.275]  But of course, he says he's tied to just unbelievable information that's going to be filed very, very soon at Infowars.com.
[01:56:21.275 --> 01:56:30.497]  But you know, there's photos of Schmidt boarding with women that are wearing hoods over their heads, their faces covered, kind of like Michael Jackson would do people.
[01:56:30.497 --> 01:56:33.398]  And it's just that these people thought they were invincible.
[01:56:33.398 --> 01:56:34.558]  They thought it would never come out.
[01:56:35.519 --> 01:56:40.260]  They thought that they just could get away with anything, and they are flipping out.
[01:56:40.260 --> 01:56:42.300]  You know, that's my next issue for you, Zach.
[01:56:42.300 --> 01:56:50.162]  They're in the New York Times saying Trump is planning a coup, when he's already peacefully taken over and got the tax cuts and doing things by the book.
[01:56:50.162 --> 01:56:56.423]  They've got high-level Obama advisors and press briefers saying that they want to kill the Republican leadership.
[01:56:56.423 --> 01:56:58.904]  I mean, they're clearly telegraphing something big.
[01:56:59.662 --> 01:57:09.389]  Okay, so that's pretty interesting information that you just kind of predicated our talk with there, because that's what I was going to get into, the information that I got out of Mountain View, California.
[01:57:23.416 --> 01:57:39.254]  The suburbs outside of Palo Alto, the Google complex right across the freeway from NASA Ames Research, where I've done a lot of work there and everyone, well I'm not going to get into that, but yeah, so we have the, we have Silicon Valley literally being the unelected leaders of our country, or at least they thought.
[01:57:39.895 --> 01:57:42.758]  That's the lesson of deep state thought.
[01:57:42.758 --> 01:57:44.319]  The Schmidt information will come out.
[01:57:44.319 --> 01:57:46.221]  I'm interested to see what you guys are going to drop.
[01:57:46.221 --> 01:57:50.184]  I have some certain points on that, but the writing's on the wall there.
[01:57:50.184 --> 01:57:51.865]  It's going to happen.
[01:57:51.865 --> 01:57:54.548]  When Trump was elected, Elon Musk toed the line.
[01:57:54.548 --> 01:58:00.092]  He's smart enough and realistic enough to take the side of humanity over AI, and he kind of publicly came out.
[01:58:00.092 --> 01:58:04.596]  And notice he said, look out for those that talk about AI gods right before they launched it.
[01:58:04.596 --> 01:58:05.737]  I mean, exactly.
[01:58:05.737 --> 01:58:06.298]  Elon Musk.
[01:58:07.825 --> 01:58:21.959]  Yeah, there's a lot more power coming out of Silicon Valley nowadays than there is the Beltway in D.C., and now Trump is kind of, you know, reversing that power and allowing people to innovate and do what they're doing, but this is deep, and this is why- That's right.
[01:58:21.959 --> 01:58:24.661]  The heart of globalism is the AI takeover.
[01:58:24.661 --> 01:58:25.462]  DARPA and the U.S.
[01:58:25.462 --> 01:58:25.803]  built it.
[01:58:25.803 --> 01:58:27.524]  We're taking it back.
[01:58:27.524 --> 01:58:28.025]  Absolutely.
[01:58:28.025 --> 01:58:31.248]  So when you see some sort of inhumane or completely immoral
[01:58:32.065 --> 01:58:32.325]  I think?
[01:58:50.823 --> 01:59:00.866]  And we'll know about it in 10 to 15 years, but at the rate technology is growing... Sure, the globalists are following basically mass global map AI directives of what they think will win.
[01:59:00.866 --> 01:59:03.547]  They think they've already merged cold-bloodedly with the technology.
[01:59:03.547 --> 01:59:04.527]  They actually said that.
[01:59:04.527 --> 01:59:10.729]  It's their power trip that's going to undo them, and Trump is noticing speeches are all about humans and people and workers.
[01:59:10.729 --> 01:59:14.410]  This is just a desperate movement to not bring in the global exterminism.
[01:59:14.410 --> 01:59:15.050]  Is that what you're saying?
[01:59:15.939 --> 01:59:17.720]  Absolutely, and Schmidt was compromised.
[01:59:17.720 --> 01:59:25.005]  I'll let you guys kind of break that or whatever, but I kind of think I know what you guys are going towards there.
[01:59:25.005 --> 01:59:28.628]  Is it child sex trafficking?
[01:59:28.628 --> 01:59:29.308]  I gotta stop.
[01:59:29.308 --> 01:59:37.794]  I can't get into that, but I have some very information that I'll be able to release out of Palo Alto, out of the Silicon Valley information that I have here shortly.
[01:59:39.207 --> 01:59:40.548]  One thing at a time, I guess.
[01:59:40.548 --> 01:59:43.690]  But yeah, you guys are on the trail.
[01:59:43.690 --> 01:59:45.352]  I would say it's somewhere in that capacity.
[01:59:45.352 --> 01:59:48.814]  Well, Corsi just got that from the White House.
[01:59:48.814 --> 01:59:50.415]  Yeah, things are happening quickly.
[01:59:50.415 --> 01:59:52.497]  And it's happening real quick.
[01:59:52.497 --> 01:59:55.619]  You know, yesterday was the shortest day of the year.
[01:59:55.619 --> 01:59:57.401]  It seems like time is speeding up.
[01:59:57.401 --> 02:00:01.684]  And when the new year commences, we will see a strike on North Korea.
[02:00:01.684 --> 02:00:04.086]  And this will be an ultimate blow to the deep state.
[02:00:04.086 --> 02:00:04.766]  By the way, you know,
[02:00:06.861 --> 02:00:12.248]  Oh, I could... It's definitely on.
[02:00:12.248 --> 02:00:14.311]  The orders have been... The orders have been written.
[02:00:14.311 --> 02:00:15.352]  The training's in progress.
[02:00:15.352 --> 02:00:17.755]  Op orders are already published.
[02:00:17.755 --> 02:00:18.916]  It's done.
[02:00:18.916 --> 02:00:21.880]  Um... I want to hear more about that, then I'm going to promise callers.
[02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:22.601]  I'm going to get to you about it.
[02:00:22.601 --> 02:00:23.743]  People want to hear Zach.
[02:00:23.743 --> 02:00:25.084]  Zach's proven to be amazingly accurate.
[02:00:25.084 --> 02:00:25.445]  Stay with us.
[02:00:29.466 --> 02:00:30.206]  I'm so excited.
[02:00:30.206 --> 02:00:40.409]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real Red Pill.
[02:00:40.409 --> 02:00:45.910]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, but it doesn't have any stimulus in it.
[02:00:45.910 --> 02:00:48.911]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[02:00:48.911 --> 02:00:57.713]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[02:00:59.791 --> 02:01:19.407]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[02:01:19.407 --> 02:01:22.089]  It is amazing!
[02:01:22.089 --> 02:01:27.053]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fucks the operation.
[02:01:30.476 --> 02:01:35.443]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[02:02:21.234 --> 02:02:25.675]  With a rebel yell!
[02:02:25.675 --> 02:02:27.296]  During the break, we're working on some big stories.
[02:02:27.296 --> 02:02:31.577]  Corsi's getting ready to break his report on fullwares.com in the next five minutes.
[02:02:32.575 --> 02:02:34.517]  It's being posted right now as we speak.
[02:02:34.517 --> 02:02:35.278]  We're going to get him on.
[02:02:35.278 --> 02:02:37.000]  I need to go to your phone calls, though.
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:38.021]  I've spent a lot of time with Zach.
[02:02:38.021 --> 02:02:40.243]  I apologize, but Zach's got important information.
[02:02:40.243 --> 02:02:41.404]  Other points you'd like to add?
[02:02:41.404 --> 02:02:41.925]  Zach, go ahead.
[02:02:43.797 --> 02:02:49.001]  Yeah, so just to kind of wrap up here, the Schmidt stepping down, let's not lose sight.
[02:02:49.001 --> 02:03:00.428]  A lot of people aren't there geographically, but in Mountain View, in Palo Alto, Google Complex, directly across the freeway from NASA Ames Research, the Tones Black Connect, and obviously the transfer of information and individuals working there.
[02:03:00.428 --> 02:03:03.150]  It's no coincidence that you see individuals
[02:03:03.812 --> 02:03:05.253]  Yeah, we ought to show that clip.
[02:03:05.253 --> 02:03:06.634]  We showed it a few days ago.
[02:03:06.634 --> 02:03:07.794]  We should show it again.
[02:03:07.794 --> 02:03:09.115]  The Navy pilot following the UFO.
[02:03:09.115 --> 02:03:09.495]  Go ahead.
[02:03:28.827 --> 02:03:31.949]  But no, he had to step down for a reason.
[02:03:31.949 --> 02:03:37.091]  They played a couple hands in the weeks before this, but I'll let you guys publish the article there because I know what it is.
[02:03:37.091 --> 02:03:39.772]  But yeah, Schmitz compromised.
[02:03:39.772 --> 02:03:42.473]  Not only him, a lot of people are compromised there.
[02:03:42.473 --> 02:03:51.498]  But just to wrap up, the deep state, predominantly with individuals on the left there, have been using, since 98,
[02:03:53.095 --> 02:04:04.457]  Really came to a precipice in 2001, radical Islamists muscled to just as a humanity, not even just in America, but in the West as general to just completely, you know, have chaos come in.
[02:04:04.457 --> 02:04:10.998]  And they were going to introduce this sort of AI God to say, look at all the problems, look at the world, look at the state that we're in.
[02:04:10.998 --> 02:04:12.438]  So you must go with us.
[02:04:12.438 --> 02:04:13.238]  We have to do this.
[02:04:13.238 --> 02:04:14.619]  So that's been combated.
[02:04:14.619 --> 02:04:16.559]  So let's not look at it as a war against Islam.
[02:04:16.559 --> 02:04:18.959]  Let's not look at it as a war against drugs.
[02:04:18.959 --> 02:04:21.680]  Let's look at it as a war between humans.
[02:04:22.216 --> 02:04:22.816]  We're good to go.
[02:04:48.658 --> 02:04:51.040]  In North Korea, Yemen, Iran, they're all kind of connected.
[02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:58.505]  North Korea problem in particular, he's to be dealing with, he's been speaking about it, as well as Penn and Mattis for quite some months.
[02:04:58.505 --> 02:04:59.726]  What do you make now?
[02:04:59.726 --> 02:05:01.087]  They're telegraphing North Korea.
[02:05:01.087 --> 02:05:08.293]  They better make a deal right now with this top Marine Corps general coming out saying that the attack is going to happen.
[02:05:09.798 --> 02:05:11.279]  I think there's no deal.
[02:05:11.279 --> 02:05:13.180]  I can't get into certain things.
[02:05:13.180 --> 02:05:14.181]  I don't think there's a deal.
[02:05:14.181 --> 02:05:17.582]  I think there's going to be a strike.
[02:05:17.582 --> 02:05:19.143]  We were willing to play with China.
[02:05:19.143 --> 02:05:23.525]  China kind of back-crossed, took the meeting with Obama.
[02:05:23.525 --> 02:05:25.647]  We saw them try to get Trump out of office.
[02:05:25.647 --> 02:05:29.929]  China was kind of playing both sides, because North Korea is a proxy, but it's really not a proxy of China.
[02:05:29.929 --> 02:05:31.950]  I mean, it is technically, but it's a proxy of the deep state.
[02:05:32.530 --> 02:05:54.489]  What percentage would you say of the government, because we know the voters put Trump in, Hillary almost stole the election, but we were able to beat it, but there are a lot of people, the patriots in the intelligence agencies and the corporations now piling on with the tax cuts with bonuses, trying to boost the economy, trying to get us out of this global meltdown they wanted to bring in, and then bring in the AI as the savior after, as the top tech giants have been saying was the plan.
[02:05:54.489 --> 02:05:58.432]  So this coup against the globalists and their AI takeover, at least at this point,
[02:05:59.631 --> 02:06:05.857]  Because everybody, at an instinctual and spiritual level, basically being warned.
[02:06:05.857 --> 02:06:16.246]  I mean, I don't want to get into the whole things behind the scenes, but a lot of important people have been basically been having events where they're seeing what's going to come, and they're understanding it.
[02:06:16.246 --> 02:06:23.252]  Because this is so big, and our species is so powerful, that there's always major ripples that the globalists thought they could get through that wouldn't happen.
[02:06:23.252 --> 02:06:25.695]  But since you're going that direction, and getting into that,
[02:06:27.576 --> 02:06:32.799]  Our own AI, our own brain, has already been able to project forward what was about to happen.
[02:06:32.799 --> 02:06:37.102]  But I think people need to understand how dire the straits are right now to turn this all around.
[02:06:37.102 --> 02:06:40.644]  And if we're dealing with an AI globalist program, why not deal with it?
[02:06:40.644 --> 02:06:42.446]  Why go ahead and take out North Korea?
[02:06:42.446 --> 02:06:46.728]  Because the globalists behind the scenes are manipulating North Korea as a set piece towards something larger.
[02:06:46.728 --> 02:06:49.730]  We've got to take it out beforehand.
[02:06:49.730 --> 02:06:52.892]  The research shows before China and Russia are ready.
[02:06:52.892 --> 02:06:53.913]  That's what Skousen keeps saying.
[02:06:54.930 --> 02:07:00.895]  Yeah, I mean you're talking about generational complete psychosis there.
[02:07:00.895 --> 02:07:11.923]  This is sort of a situation where it'd be nice to put the kid gloves on and kind of talk them down and show them the prosperity in South Korea, but obviously that's not the case there because they've been manipulated.
[02:07:11.923 --> 02:07:15.345]  Their individuals are poisoned mentally and obviously physically.
[02:07:15.345 --> 02:07:19.548]  Look at the parasites and everything else and the individuals coming over the border there.
[02:07:19.548 --> 02:07:21.930]  I don't want there to be a strike, but there has to be a strike.
[02:07:23.991 --> 02:07:26.293]  Or the satanic evil just continues on.
[02:07:26.293 --> 02:07:27.875]  Well, we'll see what happens.
[02:07:27.875 --> 02:07:29.396]  Zach, we've got your number, right?
[02:07:29.396 --> 02:07:30.417]  We've got your email.
[02:07:30.417 --> 02:07:32.458]  So next time, email us when you want to come on.
[02:07:32.458 --> 02:07:35.641]  You don't have to just fight to call into the show, okay?
[02:07:35.641 --> 02:07:37.943]  You say a big event's coming sometime this month.
[02:07:37.943 --> 02:07:41.806]  You're saying the Democrats are going to make their move, they're going to take Trump out?
[02:07:41.806 --> 02:07:46.330]  This, and I opened the call with this, I'm dubbing it, and we can put it out there, it's the deep state death hurdle.
[02:07:47.169 --> 02:07:54.513]  Um, it's gonna, it's gonna commence on the eve of Christmas into the new year and they're gonna give it all they got to try to manipulate and pull up something big here.
[02:07:54.513 --> 02:07:56.835]  I pray for the, I pray for the president's safety.
[02:07:56.835 --> 02:08:00.857]  I pray for a lot of individual safety here and around the world.
[02:08:00.857 --> 02:08:01.978]  They're gonna go for it because.
[02:08:02.498 --> 02:08:05.941]  You know, Trump played it brilliantly, and he was willing to play with China in the beginning.
[02:08:05.941 --> 02:08:09.484]  He was willing to deal with them, but they were playing both sides, and now that's gone.
[02:08:09.484 --> 02:08:10.845]  We got the tax rate where we need it.
[02:08:10.845 --> 02:08:11.366]  Countries are coming.
[02:08:11.366 --> 02:08:12.647]  And boy, are they panicking right now.
[02:08:12.647 --> 02:08:13.988]  They're Godschmitz falling.
[02:08:13.988 --> 02:08:14.769]  Thank you, Zach.
[02:08:14.769 --> 02:08:17.591]  Stay in contact with Nico and everybody else.
[02:08:17.591 --> 02:08:18.832]  So whenever you want to come on, let us know.
[02:08:18.832 --> 02:08:19.973]  Thank you, Zach.
[02:08:19.973 --> 02:08:20.193]  All right.
[02:08:20.193 --> 02:08:20.574]  Thank you.
[02:08:20.574 --> 02:08:21.054]  Thank you.
[02:08:21.054 --> 02:08:21.454]  Okay.
[02:08:21.454 --> 02:08:22.515]  I apologize to other callers.
[02:08:22.515 --> 02:08:22.996]  I'm going to go to you.
[02:08:22.996 --> 02:08:24.117]  Bam, bam, bam now.
[02:08:24.117 --> 02:08:26.539]  Can't have you on for 20 minutes like Zach, but I'm going to go to each person.
[02:08:29.119 --> 02:08:31.000]  And so many others.
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.541]  Eugene in Missouri, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:08:33.541 --> 02:08:35.681]  Go ahead.
[02:08:35.681 --> 02:08:37.422]  Yeah, thanks for having me.
[02:08:37.422 --> 02:08:44.485]  Yeah, so I was doing some research for High Voltage News the other day, and I saw a direct report put on Google Schmidt stepping down.
[02:08:44.485 --> 02:08:51.707]  So it got me thinking, the net neutrality law just passed, you know, was it in response to that?
[02:08:51.707 --> 02:08:53.908]  Can he not hide things now?
[02:08:53.908 --> 02:08:56.669]  Where does Google go from here, and what's the next CEO going to do?
[02:08:58.263 --> 02:08:59.924]  Well, we're going to find out later with Dr. Corsi.
[02:08:59.924 --> 02:09:04.568]  He's got an article that just went up on Infowars.com from his sources of why this happened to Schmidt.
[02:09:04.568 --> 02:09:09.872]  But Schmidt was a very compromised individual, a globalist, and had been running a monopoly in this country.
[02:09:09.872 --> 02:09:19.779]  So I think the company realizes that they've got to at least signal different leadership or Trump won't work with them.
[02:09:19.779 --> 02:09:23.602]  Yeah, that blows my mind that all this is coming out with Corsi today, like you mentioned.
[02:09:25.566 --> 02:09:31.127]  I guess it's no surprise, just because of the power structure and the globalist elite, the way things are.
[02:09:31.127 --> 02:09:35.029]  But, wow, just the hits keep coming.
[02:09:35.029 --> 02:09:37.169]  All right, well, thank you so much, Eugene.
[02:09:37.169 --> 02:09:40.670]  And of course, Trump's got his information, we've got ours.
[02:09:40.670 --> 02:09:42.490]  Of course, he's got his White House sources.
[02:09:42.490 --> 02:09:50.653]  We're also going with QAnon or 4chan and some of the folks that are leaking information there, but this is a big deal.
[02:09:50.653 --> 02:09:51.893]  Anything else, Eugene?
[02:09:52.921 --> 02:09:55.222]  Hey, I just want to say great work at InfoWars.
[02:09:55.222 --> 02:09:58.565]  Have a Merry Christmas, and wow, what a year it's been.
[02:09:58.565 --> 02:10:00.006]  So, looking forward to more.
[02:10:00.006 --> 02:10:03.388]  Well, that's what I want to take a ton of calls on, is just what do you think of the year?
[02:10:03.388 --> 02:10:06.309]  What do you think of them trying to say they're trying to take out Trump?
[02:10:06.309 --> 02:10:07.610]  What do you make of the tax cuts?
[02:10:07.610 --> 02:10:10.132]  I mean, what are they going to do now that they're getting their butts kicked so bad?
[02:10:10.132 --> 02:10:11.153]  So, thank you, Eugene.
[02:10:11.153 --> 02:10:11.813]  Merry Christmas to you.
[02:10:11.813 --> 02:10:13.574]  We're going to come back and go right to Corey.
[02:10:13.574 --> 02:10:16.876]  Everybody else, I'm going to go bam, bam, bam on the other side of this break.
[02:10:16.876 --> 02:10:19.598]  Briefly, free shipping still store-wide.
[02:10:21.328 --> 02:10:30.833]  50% off on a whole bunch of our best-selling items like the Real Red Pill, like super high-quality Alpha Power for male and female stamina, energy, libido.
[02:10:30.833 --> 02:10:32.033]  It's super strong.
[02:10:32.033 --> 02:10:33.554]  Super Mel's awesome.
[02:10:33.554 --> 02:10:34.734]  Anthroplex is great.
[02:10:34.734 --> 02:10:38.936]  They all are different for different people, so try the different formulas, different breakdowns.
[02:10:38.936 --> 02:10:44.939]  But this is just all the best-selling high-quality products condensed into one product with Alpha Power.
[02:10:46.042 --> 02:10:48.904]  MycoZX has been sold out for over six months.
[02:10:48.904 --> 02:10:50.765]  I looked up, it's been seven months.
[02:10:50.765 --> 02:10:52.286]  Almost seven months.
[02:10:52.286 --> 02:10:55.188]  That's the anti-fungus, anti-yeast for your gut.
[02:10:55.188 --> 02:10:57.090]  You know, the probiotics have the good bacteria.
[02:10:57.090 --> 02:11:00.072]  We have that with floralife, but the MycoZX is game-changing.
[02:11:00.072 --> 02:11:00.652]  It's incredible.
[02:11:00.652 --> 02:11:03.934]  A lot of folks have the candida, the fungus, the mold in their gut.
[02:11:03.934 --> 02:11:04.595]  This knocks it out.
[02:11:05.752 --> 02:11:10.673]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:11:10.673 --> 02:11:12.534]  Everybody in the New Year deserves this for themselves.
[02:11:12.534 --> 02:11:15.814]  It's 25% off, even though it's been sold out for over six months.
[02:11:15.814 --> 02:11:18.555]  Infowarslife, Infowarsstore.
[02:11:18.555 --> 02:11:20.055]  You can get to either one that way.
[02:11:20.055 --> 02:11:22.356]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.

[02:11:22.916 --> 02:11:23.396]  Stay with us.
[02:11:28.051 --> 02:11:30.013]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:11:30.013 --> 02:11:35.338]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:11:35.338 --> 02:11:36.920]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:45.287]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:11:45.287 --> 02:11:50.973]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.

[02:12:08.148 --> 02:12:09.708]  I feel vascular system healthy.

[02:12:27.174 --> 02:12:32.297]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is freedom from insurance.
[02:12:32.297 --> 02:12:38.000]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together to share in each other's medical expenses.
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:43.203]  Individual share amounts begin at $107 a month and $347 for families.

[02:12:47.526 --> 02:12:48.486]  See guidelines.
[02:12:48.486 --> 02:12:51.768]  Discount programs available for dental, vision, and pharmacy.

[02:13:28.837 --> 02:13:37.102]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the InfoWar.
[02:13:37.102 --> 02:13:38.323]  A 360 win.
[02:13:38.323 --> 02:13:44.887]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at InfoWarshore.com.
[02:13:44.887 --> 02:13:52.832]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip, because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[02:13:52.832 --> 02:13:53.452]  Number three,
[02:13:53.832 --> 02:13:57.894]  We're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[02:13:57.894 --> 02:14:03.996]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[02:14:03.996 --> 02:14:11.780]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on AutoShip, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[02:14:11.780 --> 02:14:18.282]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win, and with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[02:14:18.282 --> 02:14:18.923]  10% off on AutoShip.
[02:14:19.963 --> 02:14:22.384]  Win-win-win at Infowarslife.com.
[02:14:22.384 --> 02:14:24.365]  Free shipping on orders above 50 bucks.
[02:14:24.365 --> 02:14:28.468]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[02:14:28.468 --> 02:14:35.992]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that
[02:14:37.583 --> 02:14:48.431]  When you buy t-shirts, or water filtration systems, or books, or videos, or other material from InfoWarsTore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:14:48.431 --> 02:14:50.552]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[02:14:50.552 --> 02:14:54.275]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:14:54.275 --> 02:14:56.717]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best.
[02:14:56.977 --> 02:15:01.799]  Fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high-quality atomic iodine in it.
[02:15:01.799 --> 02:15:04.180]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[02:15:04.180 --> 02:15:06.821]  We've got the best mouthwash signed by Dr. Jones.
[02:15:06.821 --> 02:15:07.722]  That's my dad.
[02:15:07.722 --> 02:15:09.623]  With colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[02:15:09.623 --> 02:15:12.584]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:15:12.584 --> 02:15:21.308]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[02:15:21.308 --> 02:15:25.750]  And that's who they are, and they know we know who they are, and they're coming back against us, so we need your support.
[02:15:31.824 --> 02:15:34.428]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:15:57.216 --> 02:16:06.042]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[02:16:06.042 --> 02:16:08.224]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:16:08.224 --> 02:16:11.887]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:16:11.887 --> 02:16:15.649]  Alright, here's the report on InfoWars.com and we'll write your phone calls.
[02:16:15.649 --> 02:16:24.956]  QAnon links resignation of Google's Schmidt to Trump's executive order targeting black money pools worldwide that are involved in the trafficking of humans.
[02:16:26.093 --> 02:16:34.539]  And of course, that's heavily what the Clinton Foundation has been caught being involved in in Haiti and all over the world in Associated Press investigative reports.
[02:16:34.539 --> 02:16:40.403]  So you have to understand, folks, these people literally see other humans as animals.
[02:16:40.403 --> 02:16:43.225]  So, that's just part of it.
[02:16:43.225 --> 02:16:53.452]  My info is that just Schmitt's been a globalist and been blocking all this and, you know, it keeps accelerating Internet censorship against everybody and trying to hand the web over to the UN and George Soros, so...
[02:16:54.245 --> 02:16:55.626]  This is just a first big shot.
[02:16:55.626 --> 02:16:59.510]  A lot is happening right now, make no mistake.
[02:16:59.510 --> 02:17:03.733]  Okay, who is up next here?
[02:17:03.733 --> 02:17:05.775]  Corey in New York or on the air worldwide?
[02:17:05.775 --> 02:17:08.437]  Go ahead, then we'll go to Phil.
[02:17:08.437 --> 02:17:11.180]  Hey Alex, it's a pleasure and an honor to be with you.
[02:17:11.180 --> 02:17:13.181]  Thank you.
[02:17:13.181 --> 02:17:20.327]  Basically, I live here in New York City at a sort of globalist center, as you know.
[02:17:20.327 --> 02:17:22.029]  And this past weekend,
[02:17:23.708 --> 02:17:32.075]  I was at this party actually for Ronan Farrow, who as you know broke the Weinstein sexual assault information.
[02:17:32.075 --> 02:17:48.469]  And I think basically what they're going to do is use his credibility to move, you know, I can't speak to if he's going to, if they're going to try to kill Trump, but I can speak to the fact that I believe they're going to pivot to, you know, the sexual assault stuff.
[02:17:49.338 --> 02:17:54.201]  Well, they're clearly pivoting to that because the whole Russia thing is just a ridiculous joke.
[02:17:54.201 --> 02:17:56.983]  So then they say, oh, he's going to fire Mueller because Mueller's on to him.
[02:17:56.983 --> 02:17:58.684]  And don't criticize Mueller.
[02:17:58.684 --> 02:17:59.444]  That's impeachable.
[02:17:59.444 --> 02:18:00.945]  You can't even talk bad about him.
[02:18:00.945 --> 02:18:01.985]  He's like God.
[02:18:01.985 --> 02:18:03.206]  He's untouchable.
[02:18:03.206 --> 02:18:04.107]  He's the Lord.
[02:18:04.107 --> 02:18:08.689]  You know, he runs Uranium One and gets payoffs and gives uranium on tarmacs.
[02:18:08.689 --> 02:18:11.011]  But Loretta Lynch is on tarmacs with Clinton.
[02:18:12.486 --> 02:18:14.990]  All the FBI folks involved are on the Clinton payroll.
[02:18:14.990 --> 02:18:16.152]  But that's okay.
[02:18:16.152 --> 02:18:18.215]  Don't question it or you're evil.
[02:18:18.215 --> 02:18:21.921]  And yes, they're moving on to having a whole bunch of new fake women come out.
[02:18:21.921 --> 02:18:25.326]  That's why tapes are coming out of women that refuse to be paid off.
[02:18:25.326 --> 02:18:26.788]  And I don't think it's going to be very effective.
[02:18:26.788 --> 02:18:27.209]  What do you think?
[02:18:28.653 --> 02:18:40.857]  Um, you know, obviously the Mueller thing is just a complete joke now, and so, you know, maybe it is at the point where they're going to have to do something physical against the President, but, you know, I think you have to look at Farrow.
[02:18:40.857 --> 02:18:45.418]  He worked for Hillary Clinton, actually, so I don't know if people look at that, but that's public information.
[02:18:45.418 --> 02:18:45.898]  That's a good point.
[02:18:45.898 --> 02:18:51.060]  The people that are going to lead the movement to save the women and stop the sexual assaults have worked for the Clintons, exactly.
[02:18:51.886 --> 02:18:56.712]  Yeah, and before he worked for Hillary Clinton at the State Department, he was at UNICEF.
[02:18:56.712 --> 02:18:58.413]  So I don't know if this is a U.N.
[02:18:58.413 --> 02:19:02.158]  Clinton sort of operation, but I don't think he's a bad guy.
[02:19:02.158 --> 02:19:05.742]  I think he's just being directed by his handlers kind of thing.
[02:19:05.742 --> 02:19:09.746]  And at the same party, actually Don Lemon was there, and this was days after.
[02:19:11.728 --> 02:19:14.532]  Yeah, you hear Chuckie Schumer going, I hope the president likes me.
[02:19:14.532 --> 02:19:14.953]  Exactly.
[02:19:14.953 --> 02:19:16.655]  They just worship power.
[02:19:28.158 --> 02:19:30.559]  Not actually delivering and being good.
[02:19:30.559 --> 02:19:33.001]  They worship just the office itself.
[02:19:33.001 --> 02:19:34.342]  And that's why they're so freaked out.
[02:19:34.342 --> 02:19:34.902]  Great point.
[02:19:34.902 --> 02:19:35.863]  Thank you, Corey.
[02:19:35.863 --> 02:19:36.723]  Very interesting intel.
[02:19:36.723 --> 02:19:38.824]  Thank you for calling and thank you for holding.
[02:19:38.824 --> 02:19:39.685]  Have a great Christmas.
[02:19:39.685 --> 02:19:42.206]  I'm going to be a good boy and answer the callers quickly.
[02:19:42.206 --> 02:19:43.407]  Phil in New York.
[02:19:43.407 --> 02:19:43.967]  Phil in New York.
[02:19:43.967 --> 02:19:44.888]  Another caller from New York.
[02:19:44.888 --> 02:19:46.529]  Go ahead.
[02:19:46.529 --> 02:19:47.049]  Hi, Alex.
[02:19:47.049 --> 02:19:49.010]  I just wanted to say Merry Christmas.
[02:19:49.010 --> 02:19:49.290]  Thank you.
[02:19:49.290 --> 02:19:50.731]  To start out with.
[02:19:50.731 --> 02:19:53.913]  And yeah, this first year in office, I mean, I didn't vote
[02:19:54.665 --> 02:19:59.127]  For Donald Trump, but at the same time, I definitely didn't want Hillary Clinton getting in.
[02:19:59.127 --> 02:20:05.949]  And, you know, it's been a whirlwind year, and, you know, my kids are growing up and trying to explain all the changes in the world and everything.
[02:20:05.949 --> 02:20:09.490]  And I think they just got to drop the Russia thing, you know, at this point.
[02:20:09.490 --> 02:20:18.653]  I mean, I know it's probably not going to happen, but I really... Man, those evil Russians brought up the stock market and built up our military and, like, you know, gave us all these new jobs and huge tax cuts.
[02:20:18.653 --> 02:20:19.574]  Those evil Russians.
[02:20:19.574 --> 02:20:22.635]  I mean, well, thank you, President Putin, if it is him doing all this.
[02:20:22.635 --> 02:20:22.835]  Wow.
[02:20:24.168 --> 02:20:27.490]  You know, you read, like I read Robert Parry, you know, Consortium News.
[02:20:27.490 --> 02:20:32.734]  I mean, this is a guy who broke Iran-Contra stories, so you figure he'd be a darling of the Democrats.
[02:20:32.734 --> 02:20:37.537]  And he's writing about how the Russian gate narrative is just ridiculous, it's reverse McCarthyism.
[02:20:37.537 --> 02:20:41.339]  So are all the old, real liberal, real investigative journalists.
[02:20:41.339 --> 02:20:46.642]  Cy Hirsch is saying it's fake, you've got Wikileaks, Sassan saying it's fake, because it is!
[02:20:46.642 --> 02:20:48.043]  And now we have all the proof!
[02:20:48.043 --> 02:20:49.064]  It's totally made up!
[02:20:49.853 --> 02:20:51.074]  And you have the intelligence guys.
[02:20:51.074 --> 02:20:55.837]  You've got guys like Bill Binney, and I think Colleen Rowley, and you have all those whistleblowers.
[02:20:55.837 --> 02:20:58.899]  And Colleen Rowley doesn't think too highly of Robert Mueller.
[02:20:58.899 --> 02:21:01.441]  And, you know, they're saying there's nothing there.
[02:21:01.441 --> 02:21:03.663]  If anything else, it was a leak.
[02:21:03.663 --> 02:21:05.624]  But you can't mention that.
[02:21:05.624 --> 02:21:07.625]  You know, they want to derail Trump, no matter what he does.
[02:21:07.625 --> 02:21:10.868]  And I said, I think, you know, you've got to give him a chance.
[02:21:10.868 --> 02:21:11.548]  I'm waiting to see other facts.
[02:21:11.548 --> 02:21:15.551]  You're saying you were neutral on it, but seeing the witch hunt has made you more pro-Trump.
[02:21:16.645 --> 02:21:18.127]  I never thought Putin was involved.
[02:21:18.127 --> 02:21:19.268]  I thought that was just kind of silly.
[02:21:19.268 --> 02:21:21.531]  Of course.
[02:21:21.531 --> 02:21:24.855]  What about 401Ks being up 35 to 40 points?
[02:21:24.855 --> 02:21:26.818]  Because I know leftists that admit that to me.
[02:21:26.818 --> 02:21:29.121]  They go, yeah, mine's up over 30 percent, but I still hate him.
[02:21:30.310 --> 02:21:32.151]  Yeah, if mine's up, that's a good thing.
[02:21:32.151 --> 02:21:33.391]  I have no complaints about that.
[02:21:33.391 --> 02:21:38.392]  I just want the world to be good for the people I care about, and even the people I don't know, you know?
[02:21:38.392 --> 02:21:39.713]  I want a world where we're not having a war.
[02:21:39.713 --> 02:21:41.913]  Trump is very pragmatic, but he's not anti-human.
[02:21:41.913 --> 02:21:43.014]  He's not a pedophile.
[02:21:43.014 --> 02:21:43.794]  He's not a globalist.
[02:21:43.794 --> 02:21:45.314]  That's why he's not in our club.
[02:21:45.314 --> 02:21:50.436]  He's very old-fashioned, very blue-collar, really, you know, when it comes down to it at the end of the day.
[02:21:50.436 --> 02:21:52.776]  And he cares about the cops, which is what I like.
[02:21:52.776 --> 02:21:54.917]  My brother's a detective, so that means a lot.
[02:21:55.888 --> 02:21:59.469]  Well, he's just super old-fashioned, and the globalists think he's a joke.
[02:21:59.469 --> 02:22:00.089]  Well, guess what?
[02:22:00.089 --> 02:22:01.670]  Old-fashioned was new.
[02:22:01.670 --> 02:22:03.050]  Globalism is tyranny.
[02:22:03.050 --> 02:22:05.831]  We want old-fashioned prosperity and straight shooting.
[02:22:05.831 --> 02:22:06.912]  Thank you for the call, Phil.
[02:22:06.912 --> 02:22:07.852]  Have a great Christmas coming up.
[02:22:07.852 --> 02:22:09.133]  God bless you.
[02:22:09.133 --> 02:22:12.514]  Let's go to Kevin in, what's WV, West Virginia.
[02:22:12.514 --> 02:22:15.835]  You're on the air in the great WV, getting the coal mining turned back on.
[02:22:15.835 --> 02:22:17.215]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[02:22:17.215 --> 02:22:22.857]  Hey, um, Jack hit the nail on the head, especially with what I wanted to, especially what I'm thinking.
[02:22:22.857 --> 02:22:24.658]  And I'm thinking your Christmas surprise.
[02:22:25.322 --> 02:22:32.327]  Is the overthrow of Trump, and is them trying to kill him, and not a Kushner indictment or Donald Jr.
[02:22:32.327 --> 02:22:33.387]  indictment?
[02:22:33.387 --> 02:22:36.910]  Absolutely, I think that this is something that they're trying to pull.
[02:22:36.910 --> 02:22:43.614]  And another question that I wanted to, or another point that I wanted to get at was following off of Zach.
[02:22:43.614 --> 02:22:54.681]  Remember Gordy Rose, the guy, founder of D-Wave, saying being in front of the D-Wave computer, their quantum computer, is like being in front of an alien god.
[02:22:55.236 --> 02:22:59.619]  So yes, this is all interconnected and it is a spiritual thing as well.
[02:22:59.619 --> 02:23:05.884]  But I do believe that we are facing a huge, huge thing, like Zach said.
[02:23:05.884 --> 02:23:08.386]  And I do believe they're going to try to kill Trump.
[02:23:08.386 --> 02:23:09.387]  Absolutely.
[02:23:09.387 --> 02:23:11.529]  He has done more than what Kennedy did.
[02:23:11.529 --> 02:23:15.332]  And look what Kennedy tried to do and what he got killed for.
[02:23:15.332 --> 02:23:16.592]  Excellent points, Kevin.
[02:23:16.592 --> 02:23:17.613]  Thank you for holding.
[02:23:17.613 --> 02:23:18.474]  Let me just finish up.
[02:23:18.474 --> 02:23:19.695]  I appreciate your call and what you said.
[02:23:20.607 --> 02:23:26.733]  The globalists say, we don't believe in God yet, we're creating it with AI and genetic engineering.
[02:23:26.733 --> 02:23:31.397]  And then the media comes out and goes, Jones is crazy, no one's saying that, and there's no alien that's been created.
[02:23:31.397 --> 02:23:34.540]  Well, you can splice humans and animals, that's alien, not of this world.
[02:23:34.540 --> 02:23:36.602]  But then you read their own writings, they say it.
[02:23:36.602 --> 02:23:41.026]  Now because they can't suppress what I've been doing, what you've been doing, they go, okay, yeah, we are.
[02:23:41.026 --> 02:23:44.169]  And Trump and others are just like, this is crazy!
[02:23:45.050 --> 02:23:46.691]  It's one thing to want to develop all this.
[02:23:46.691 --> 02:23:47.412]  That might destroy us.
[02:23:47.412 --> 02:23:49.613]  But it's another thing to say, we're all obsolete.
[02:23:49.613 --> 02:23:50.894]  We've got to be gotten rid of.
[02:23:50.894 --> 02:23:55.417]  Because your AI God says, get rid of the humans and I will let you merge with me.
[02:23:55.417 --> 02:23:56.258]  I have the answers.
[02:23:56.258 --> 02:24:02.802]  But first, that's like Emperor Palpatine telling, you know, Ant and Skywalker, go do evil stuff and, you know, I'll save your wife.
[02:24:02.802 --> 02:24:03.122]  It didn't.
[02:24:03.122 --> 02:24:04.343]  It ended up getting her killed.
[02:24:04.343 --> 02:24:10.247]  I mean, you know, it's the oldest thing in fables, you name it, is I'm going to be God.
[02:24:10.247 --> 02:24:13.549]  If I just kill everybody, it says I'll be God.
[02:24:13.549 --> 02:24:14.710]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:24:15.330 --> 02:24:21.394]  It's biblical, it's happening, and now humanity realizes we're about to have a major fight.
[02:24:21.394 --> 02:24:24.096]  As I keep saying, we're getting ready for the next big fight.
[02:24:24.096 --> 02:24:26.478]  This is just one little awakening period.
[02:24:27.774 --> 02:24:30.356]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?
[02:24:30.356 --> 02:24:32.497]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?
[02:24:32.497 --> 02:24:34.478]  Are you happy paying high prices?

[02:28:56.884 --> 02:28:59.766]  Alright, we're going right back to your phone calls.
[02:28:59.766 --> 02:29:00.947]  Jeff in Vancouver.
[02:29:00.947 --> 02:29:03.469]  Lewis in California.
[02:29:03.469 --> 02:29:04.950]  Debra in Arizona.
[02:29:17.995 --> 02:29:19.356]  Rich in Wisconsin.
[02:29:19.356 --> 02:29:21.237]  John in Wisconsin is up next.
[02:29:21.237 --> 02:29:24.018]  But I wanted to get Dr. Corsi just to pop in for a few minutes.
[02:29:24.018 --> 02:29:27.300]  Infowars.com, DC Bureau Chief Ed.
[02:29:27.300 --> 02:29:33.403]  Q Anon, that's the folks on 4chan, links resignation of Google Schmidt to Trump's executive order.
[02:29:33.403 --> 02:29:36.225]  Dr. Corsi, of course, has a Harvard degree in finance and banking.
[02:29:36.225 --> 02:29:39.046]  He's an expert, a State Department advisor on anti-terrorism.
[02:29:39.046 --> 02:29:42.108]  So he knows how to scan through these documents and look at these connections.
[02:29:42.108 --> 02:29:43.969]  He brought out the whole Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac looting of
[02:29:45.442 --> 02:29:48.624]  Obama and then Trump jumped on that and defunded it as recommended.
[02:29:48.624 --> 02:29:55.529]  So I'm just pointing out that of course he doesn't just go read stuff on 4chan and just believe it, but there's a lot of really good stuff on there.
[02:29:55.529 --> 02:29:56.670]  And so he's breaking this down.
[02:29:56.670 --> 02:30:06.537]  And of course Schmidt's been the anti-free market guy, he's been the globalist, he's got a lot of the DARPA technology for himself the last 20 years, or 19 years since Google got founded.
[02:30:06.537 --> 02:30:10.040]  And he's been very, very arrogant, just saying we're gods now, no one can stop us.
[02:30:10.920 --> 02:30:13.462]  Pushing the whole anti-human agenda.
[02:30:13.462 --> 02:30:15.263]  Apple, the screen sickness, all of it.
[02:30:15.263 --> 02:30:16.324]  The suicide factories.
[02:30:16.324 --> 02:30:20.387]  I mean, the whole thing from where the process begins to your children.
[02:30:20.387 --> 02:30:21.868]  The screen time, all of it.
[02:30:21.868 --> 02:30:23.949]  Screen sickness, as I've coined it.
[02:30:23.949 --> 02:30:28.392]  And little dopamine receptors being flipped and manipulated like Sean Parker of Facebook said.
[02:30:28.392 --> 02:30:32.215]  So suddenly, when Trump got in, all these execs are going, it's evil, it's bad.
[02:30:32.215 --> 02:30:32.895]  We admit it's bad.
[02:30:32.895 --> 02:30:33.796]  We're sorry.
[02:30:33.796 --> 02:30:39.800]  It was designed to basically make like your phones a video game, but where we track and control you and add stimuli to politically manipulate you.
[02:30:40.643 --> 02:30:46.306]  And we pop out massive amounts of soy products in these areas to create mental illness in men and women.
[02:30:46.306 --> 02:30:48.608]  I mean, they know what they're doing.
[02:30:48.608 --> 02:30:50.069]  And that's why they attack us.
[02:30:50.069 --> 02:30:55.212]  So, just encapsulating this, Dr. Corsi, thanks for popping on on short notice.
[02:30:55.212 --> 02:30:58.193]  What's going on in the tea leaves here with the Schmidt resignation?
[02:30:58.193 --> 02:31:02.156]  Because, you know, you and I and others have been hammering, we need antitrust.
[02:31:02.156 --> 02:31:07.319]  Trump's put in somebody at the Securities and Exchange Commission that is big on antitrust with Google, Facebook, Twitter.
[02:31:08.560 --> 02:31:10.361]  And so, I mean, is this a sign of their capitulation?
[02:31:10.361 --> 02:31:14.043]  Because I've only seen acceleration in their censoring.
[02:31:14.043 --> 02:31:15.904]  I think this is the beginning.
[02:31:15.904 --> 02:31:23.668]  When I noticed the QAnon post today, and I've been following QAnon much more closely, he appears to be an insider.
[02:31:24.381 --> 02:31:30.924]  Who is really, uh, telegraphing information coming out of the White House, uh, and in advance.
[02:31:30.924 --> 02:31:32.385]  And he's been very, very accurate.
[02:31:32.385 --> 02:31:47.613]  Now, the post today was that there is a no coincidence, you know, one of the fundamental rules of politics, nothing's a coincidence, that Eric Schmidt resigns after Trump signs this EO executive order.
[02:31:47.613 --> 02:31:53.776]  Now, the executive order is one that's a clampdown on international human rights abuses.
[02:31:54.560 --> 02:31:59.182]  And as I read it, one of the things it's targeted at is the international sex trade.
[02:31:59.182 --> 02:32:01.662]  I mean, this is really going after the money.
[02:32:01.662 --> 02:32:09.225]  What Trump has decided to do is to utilize a variety of federal laws to confiscate the money
[02:32:10.203 --> 02:32:13.747]  of human rights abusers worldwide.
[02:32:13.747 --> 02:32:18.072]  And this, I think, is a carefully thought out plan.
[02:32:18.072 --> 02:32:26.182]  I think Trump does believe that the New World Order and the whole globalists are Satanists, that they have at their heart the pedophilia.
[02:32:26.842 --> 02:32:35.669]  And Trump is really taking steps, I think we're going to see more and more of it over the next few months, to go after those engaging in human rights abuses and take their money away.
[02:32:35.669 --> 02:32:44.736]  Which is really, follow the money, it's a very effective... Sure, just like Jerry Epstein and just all these people, this is the satanic glue that holds these people together.
[02:32:44.736 --> 02:32:53.202]  And the word I've got from my intelligence sources is that Trump and others worldwide have just green-lighted open season on these people, that they're in full panic mode.
[02:32:54.489 --> 02:32:56.010]  I think that's correct.
[02:32:56.010 --> 02:33:01.774]  And I think we're going to see a whole series of indictments and other confiscations of money going on.
[02:33:01.774 --> 02:33:05.196]  I think Trump is extremely serious about this.
[02:33:05.196 --> 02:33:12.301]  And anyone who doubts Trump's resolve just has to take a look at how carefully he passed this tax bill.
[02:33:12.301 --> 02:33:14.062]  He fulfilled his promises.
[02:33:14.062 --> 02:33:16.964]  Trump has been fulfilling promises left and right.
[02:33:16.964 --> 02:33:23.648]  I see increasing devotion to God and increasing statements about his devotion to God coming from Trump.
[02:33:24.376 --> 02:33:31.439]  I think this is a real turnaround and the globalists should be on the run because I think Trump is coming after them.
[02:33:31.439 --> 02:33:33.459]  And it's not just rhetoric he's delivering.
[02:33:33.459 --> 02:33:42.863]  The New York Times says Trump's planning a coup, which of course they're planning the coup, and top Democrat officials are calling for Trump, Pence, you name it, to be killed.
[02:33:43.729 --> 02:33:50.816]  Obama advisor wants Pence, wants McConnell, and wants Ryan killed for the tax cut.
[02:33:50.816 --> 02:33:59.805]  The sickening evil left thought they had their foot on the neck of America, but now they are just in full, disgusting, frothing frenzy.
[02:33:59.805 --> 02:34:01.386]  I mean, they really had it out for everybody.
[02:34:01.386 --> 02:34:02.027]  They are sick.
[02:34:03.701 --> 02:34:04.702]  That's right.
[02:34:04.702 --> 02:34:12.310]  Also, Treasury came out with an analysis of some 13 people on this executive order that they've named.
[02:34:12.310 --> 02:34:22.181]  The President of Gambia, Miramar General, and the researchers are already finding these people have deep ties to the Clintons and to the Clinton Foundation.
[02:34:23.098 --> 02:34:34.644]  And, you know, the Clinton's ties to pedophilia go back to this Laura Sillsby who was arrested in Haiti trying to smuggle 33 children out without documentation.
[02:34:34.644 --> 02:34:35.825]  And convicted!
[02:34:35.825 --> 02:34:36.185]  And convicted!
[02:34:36.185 --> 02:34:40.887]  And she's changed her name now and runs a deal for disadvantaged children over and over again.
[02:34:40.887 --> 02:34:41.587]  The same M.O.
[02:34:41.587 --> 02:34:42.468]  from Sandusky on.
[02:34:43.864 --> 02:34:51.327]  And the Clintons are very deeply tied with these people, with Silsby and her operation in Haiti, as they are with Epstein.
[02:34:51.327 --> 02:34:53.748]  I think this is all going to come out.
[02:34:53.748 --> 02:35:03.232]  I think really the pedophilia in Hollywood, in New York, among the arts and among the elite, I think this is going to be the next shoe to fall.
[02:35:03.232 --> 02:35:05.493]  And I'm very pleased to see that Trump signed this.
[02:35:05.493 --> 02:35:07.374]  The executive order got very little attention.
[02:35:07.914 --> 02:35:09.575]  It was a difficult order to read.
[02:35:09.575 --> 02:35:11.136]  You had to really study it.
[02:35:11.136 --> 02:35:12.577]  You had to go look up the law.
[02:35:12.577 --> 02:35:25.765]  And so really, it's an executive order targeting sex traffic, women, children, you name it, and other illicit human rights violations, which we know isn't just the funding mechanism of these intergovernmental black ops, the corrupt networks, the black hat networks.
[02:35:25.765 --> 02:35:27.165]  It's the compromising system.
[02:35:27.165 --> 02:35:27.906]  It's the initiation.
[02:35:29.404 --> 02:35:40.848]  And Trump realizes that he can get billions of dollars reducing the deficit, reducing the debt by just simply confiscating the money of these human rights abusers.
[02:35:40.848 --> 02:35:44.610]  And then cut off their ability to engage in future crimes.
[02:35:44.610 --> 02:35:45.350]  Precisely.
[02:35:45.350 --> 02:35:50.352]  This is the most effective action I've seen any American president take ever.
[02:35:51.255 --> 02:35:53.556]  Well you know what he did when he got in a year ago?
[02:35:53.556 --> 02:35:55.517]  I've talked to all the black ops people.
[02:35:55.517 --> 02:35:58.678]  They literally wiped out the Mexican drug cartels and their networks here.
[02:35:58.678 --> 02:36:00.118]  They're almost all gone now.
[02:36:00.118 --> 02:36:04.000]  And they just wiped them out in the first 8-9 months of this year.
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.701]  Because Trump's like, no we're not going to fund radical Islam.
[02:36:06.701 --> 02:36:07.561]  Boom.
[02:36:07.561 --> 02:36:08.661]  And then Russia helped.
[02:36:08.661 --> 02:36:11.622]  No we're not going to let the Mexican drug cartels run around.
[02:36:11.622 --> 02:36:12.883]  We're not doing business with them anymore.
[02:36:12.883 --> 02:36:13.703]  Wipe them out.
[02:36:13.703 --> 02:36:15.184]  And now going over the pedophile rings.
[02:36:15.184 --> 02:36:15.824]  Wipe them out.
[02:36:15.824 --> 02:36:16.444]  It is incredible.
[02:36:17.723 --> 02:36:21.824]  And what I really liked about the way Trump did this is he didn't make a fanfare of it.
[02:36:21.824 --> 02:36:27.346]  The big news was, you know, the tax cut.
[02:36:27.346 --> 02:36:28.726]  That was the news.
[02:36:28.726 --> 02:36:34.108]  This he just very quietly signed and then you had to watch.
[02:36:34.108 --> 02:36:38.729]  And that tells you it's military because he never talks about something military before it happens.
[02:36:38.729 --> 02:36:41.009]  So you notice very quietly done.
[02:36:41.009 --> 02:36:44.830]  But that's what I was talking to some of my military sources, people that are involved in this.
[02:36:44.830 --> 02:36:46.851]  They said last week we had him on and this week.
[02:36:48.601 --> 02:36:50.222]  All these rich families are fleeing.
[02:36:50.222 --> 02:36:51.123]  They're just running.
[02:36:51.123 --> 02:36:54.445]  They're leaving their stuff in their houses and running to the Middle East.
[02:36:54.445 --> 02:36:55.466]  And these aren't Muslims.
[02:36:55.466 --> 02:36:58.568]  These are rich, prominent liberals are hauling ass.
[02:36:59.662 --> 02:37:02.344]  Well, and I see the intelligence connections in here.
[02:37:02.344 --> 02:37:05.006]  I mean, this is the professional way to do it.
[02:37:05.006 --> 02:37:10.271]  Very quietly, a very well-written, crafted executive order.
[02:37:10.271 --> 02:37:19.198]  There's a whole department within Treasury for confiscating the assets overseas and the United States of these international criminals.
[02:37:19.198 --> 02:37:23.241]  And if Trump goes after the money, he's going to make a huge impact.
[02:37:23.241 --> 02:37:28.065]  And he doesn't have to say much about it, but the fact that he's doing it this way indicates to me it's serious.
[02:37:28.672 --> 02:37:29.732]  Well, they already know.
[02:37:29.732 --> 02:37:33.093]  They already know because it's like evacuating from Saigon or something.
[02:37:33.093 --> 02:37:35.734]  You know, they're hanging off the helicopters, kids.
[02:37:35.734 --> 02:37:39.535]  All right, Dr. Corsi, all your prolific work at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.

[02:39:08.355 --> 02:39:13.538]  B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system.

[02:39:28.973 --> 02:39:30.054]  Why is the mold?
[02:39:30.054 --> 02:39:31.775]  Why is the yeast taking over?
[02:39:31.775 --> 02:39:32.756]  What is going on?
[02:39:32.756 --> 02:39:33.776]  What has changed?

[02:40:09.940 --> 02:40:14.604]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:40:14.604 --> 02:40:17.946]  I cannot sell something unless it helps somebody.
[02:40:17.946 --> 02:40:20.268]  And you can't support an organization that isn't fighting hard.
[02:40:20.268 --> 02:40:21.669]  Look at the response we're getting.
[02:40:21.669 --> 02:40:23.631]  Whoever changed the world together.
[02:40:23.631 --> 02:40:24.631]  You are the InfoWar.
[02:40:24.631 --> 02:40:25.372]  God bless you all.
[02:40:28.460 --> 02:40:33.607]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[02:40:33.607 --> 02:40:38.393]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[02:40:38.393 --> 02:40:46.683]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[02:40:47.063 --> 02:40:50.565]  This is critical, because stomach acid kills most probiotics.
[02:40:50.565 --> 02:40:55.807]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[02:40:55.807 --> 02:41:03.110]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[02:41:03.110 --> 02:41:07.032]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[02:41:07.032 --> 02:41:11.734]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[02:41:11.734 --> 02:41:15.336]  Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care.
[02:41:15.976 --> 02:41:16.638]  We're good to go.
[02:41:29.125 --> 02:41:30.767]  Matt in Ohio, you're on the air.
[02:41:30.767 --> 02:41:31.707]  Another Matt, go ahead.
[02:41:31.707 --> 02:41:46.319]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long-time listener of InfoWars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic, and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[02:41:46.319 --> 02:41:53.925]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[02:41:53.925 --> 02:41:54.445]  Well, thank you.
[02:41:54.445 --> 02:41:56.487]  My favorite new one is the
[02:41:57.047 --> 02:42:05.573]  Don't tread on me, but said it says won't tread on me, and it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake, and then it's got the American flag, InfoWars.com on the right arm.
[02:42:05.573 --> 02:42:11.817]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[02:42:11.817 --> 02:42:14.979]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning T-shirt.
[02:42:14.979 --> 02:42:21.824]  Trigger Warning T-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger with a yield sign and then InfoWars.com on the back.
[02:42:21.824 --> 02:42:25.927]  That is the new shirt of the month, available exclusively at InfoWars4.com.
[02:42:31.733 --> 02:42:34.416]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:42:49.708 --> 02:42:54.512]  Defending the republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:42:54.512 --> 02:42:58.815]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:42:58.815 --> 02:43:00.496]  Man, we trolled the media.
[02:43:00.496 --> 02:43:07.061]  I took Robin Stone out to my favorite shooting range, The Range, is what it's called here in Austin, Texas, a couple days ago.
[02:43:07.061 --> 02:43:11.264]  We said, we're defensively out here training for all the liberals saying, hashtag, hunt republicans.
[02:43:11.937 --> 02:43:18.882]  So the media is now spinning it, New York Daily News, you name it, that we're out training to kill people, and then Roger doesn't do a lot of shooting.
[02:43:18.882 --> 02:43:22.644]  So he's getting instructed, here's the safety, here's where you put your finger.
[02:43:22.644 --> 02:43:30.189]  I'm shooting a lot of guns I've never shot before, of course I was shooting bullseye, but still, you know, we're not trying to act like we know everything out there.
[02:43:30.189 --> 02:43:31.870]  But it was good to see Roger shooting.
[02:43:31.870 --> 02:43:36.874]  We weren't out there going, we're tactical, master, you know, Navy SEALs, Black Ops, Delta Force.
[02:43:36.874 --> 02:43:38.475]  No, we're just out there promoting the Second Amendment.
[02:43:39.312 --> 02:43:41.734]  And I'm a pretty good shot and do quite a bit of shooting.
[02:43:41.734 --> 02:43:43.975]  But as for Roger, he's only shotgun three or four times in his life.
[02:43:43.975 --> 02:43:46.837]  And he got to where he was shooting bullseye after about 30 minutes shooting.
[02:43:46.837 --> 02:43:49.539]  But it is quite the heyday they're having right now.
[02:43:49.539 --> 02:43:50.459]  And we knew they would.
[02:43:50.459 --> 02:43:56.883]  See, because they live in the cloistered, compact cities like Roger did and never got around it.
[02:43:56.883 --> 02:44:00.346]  So we take them back out and then undomesticate them.
[02:44:00.346 --> 02:44:02.427]  I mean, that's what we do.
[02:44:02.427 --> 02:44:05.349]  And so we had a lot of fun and we were live streaming it.
[02:44:06.092 --> 02:44:09.533]  I don't want to bring a bunch of HD equipment because then we get busy and it never gets put out.
[02:44:09.533 --> 02:44:12.314]  We just streamed an hour and a half live shooting.
[02:44:12.314 --> 02:44:15.836]  And that's why it's got millions of views now on the internet and all over television.
[02:44:15.836 --> 02:44:17.836]  So there you go.
[02:44:17.836 --> 02:44:20.137]  Let's go ahead and go to John in Wisconsin.
[02:44:20.137 --> 02:44:20.637]  You're on the air.
[02:44:20.637 --> 02:44:22.798]  Thanks for calling.
[02:44:22.798 --> 02:44:24.239]  Merry Christmas, Alex.
[02:44:24.239 --> 02:44:25.719]  You too, brother.
[02:44:25.719 --> 02:44:32.302]  Hey, listen, I was listening to your friend earlier on the phone and that's pretty scary stuff.
[02:44:32.302 --> 02:44:33.162]  You talking about Zach?
[02:44:34.045 --> 02:44:34.645]  Yes.
[02:44:34.645 --> 02:44:36.207]  Yeah, he's given us a lot of great information.
[02:44:36.207 --> 02:44:38.949]  I know who he is, and he worked with him.
[02:44:38.949 --> 02:44:40.230]  Go ahead.
[02:44:40.230 --> 02:44:43.812]  No, it's a good thing we don't, because he probably wouldn't be there anymore.
[02:44:43.812 --> 02:44:57.002]  Hey, the operatives for the Deep State, or the New World Order, or whatever you want to call them, are they mainly in the Senate?
[02:44:57.002 --> 02:44:59.064]  Or are there operatives everywhere?
[02:45:00.123 --> 02:45:02.746]  They're in big corporations, they're in big banks, they're in Hollywood.
[02:45:02.746 --> 02:45:08.493]  They're globalists that are anti-human, that want to domesticate people to control them, and are anti-free market.
[02:45:08.493 --> 02:45:11.476]  So they're ultra-rich that don't want other people to become wealthy.
[02:45:12.166 --> 02:45:13.467]  And they're just social engineers.
[02:45:13.467 --> 02:45:14.668]  They're cold-blooded.
[02:45:14.668 --> 02:45:15.808]  They hate the general public.
[02:45:15.808 --> 02:45:19.811]  They have an extreme hatred of everybody and want to kill everybody.
[02:45:19.811 --> 02:45:22.873]  I know that sounds crazy, but look at what the Communists did or Hitler.
[02:45:22.873 --> 02:45:24.514]  I mean, that's what they want.
[02:45:24.514 --> 02:45:26.855]  It's a global exterminist world plan.
[02:45:26.855 --> 02:45:28.756]  They believe that super machines are coming out.
[02:45:28.756 --> 02:45:30.017]  They're going to merge with.
[02:45:30.017 --> 02:45:34.680]  They've already said, we're building a world that's anti-human, post-human.
[02:45:34.680 --> 02:45:41.424]  And that's whether it's, you know, people like the heads of Google or others, they're all on record saying it.
[02:45:43.530 --> 02:45:51.594]  Well, they came out in the Times and talked about Trump doing a coup in the United States.
[02:45:51.594 --> 02:45:55.536]  And I think, I've been thinking about this for a couple weeks now.
[02:45:55.536 --> 02:46:01.238]  I think what it would look like, first of all, he'd get a new AG, somebody who would do it.
[02:46:01.238 --> 02:46:10.123]  And it seems though he knows all the names of everybody that, you know, contradictory to this country.
[02:46:10.123 --> 02:46:12.104]  What will be the
[02:46:14.807 --> 02:46:17.189]  Oh, I don't know.
[02:46:17.189 --> 02:46:25.137]  The fact that he, you know, I know due to the rules of order they have a subject at arms in the Senate.
[02:46:25.137 --> 02:46:27.099]  I'm pretty sure in the Congress.
[02:46:27.099 --> 02:46:27.640]  Well, sure.
[02:46:27.640 --> 02:46:29.301]  I mean, here's what's happened.
[02:46:29.301 --> 02:46:31.243]  The globalists see us as a coup.
[02:46:31.243 --> 02:46:35.087]  The voters, they think they run the country, so they see us as stealing it back.
[02:46:35.087 --> 02:46:37.670]  And so they're saying Trump restoring the Republic through
[02:46:38.496 --> 02:46:44.557]  Rule of law and through constitutional process, they're dubbing that a coup as they try to run a crew.
[02:46:44.557 --> 02:46:45.377]  God bless you, John.
[02:46:45.377 --> 02:46:47.138]  I appreciate your call.
[02:46:47.138 --> 02:46:47.818]  Great points.
[02:46:47.818 --> 02:46:51.618]  But again, they have nothing left but violence now.
[02:46:51.618 --> 02:46:53.019]  They're planning something big.
[02:46:53.019 --> 02:46:54.319]  We have to be aware of it.
[02:46:54.319 --> 02:46:55.039]  And that's all.
[02:46:55.039 --> 02:46:56.839]  We've beaten them so far.
[02:46:56.839 --> 02:47:01.540]  And every passing week, their chances of turning this around get worse and worse and worse.
[02:47:01.540 --> 02:47:02.920]  So, good things are happening.
[02:47:02.920 --> 02:47:04.040]  Thank God for that.
[02:47:04.040 --> 02:47:05.881]  Rich in Wisconsin, then Deborah.
[02:47:05.881 --> 02:47:06.741]  Rich, thanks for holding.
[02:47:06.741 --> 02:47:07.181]  You're on the air.
[02:47:09.253 --> 02:47:10.294]  Alex, Merry Christmas.
[02:47:10.294 --> 02:47:10.975]  How are you, sir?
[02:47:10.975 --> 02:47:11.315]  I'm great.
[02:47:11.315 --> 02:47:12.036]  Thanks for calling.
[02:47:12.036 --> 02:47:13.918]  God bless you.
[02:47:13.918 --> 02:47:15.379]  God bless.
[02:47:15.379 --> 02:47:27.190]  I want to bring up something you said earlier, that we're in a spiritual war, and that could not be more true now than ever before because of the fact that the mainstream media is coming after us, the deep state is coming after us.
[02:47:27.190 --> 02:47:31.534]  I want to bring back an editorial that the LA Times did.
[02:47:31.534 --> 02:47:33.216]  This was a couple years ago, I want to say.
[02:47:34.016 --> 02:47:41.520]  Basically stating that the next targets were going to be conservatives and also Christians instead of radical Islamic terrorists.
[02:47:41.520 --> 02:47:51.044]  Now more than ever I believe that that's the case and I believe that the establishment, the deep state, the military-industrial complex, they're going to come after us.
[02:47:51.044 --> 02:47:51.604]  Well that's it.
[02:47:51.604 --> 02:47:59.368]  If they can take out Trump then they think they're just going to one by one in an undeclared war come after us and that's why if that kicks off
[02:47:59.992 --> 02:48:02.853]  The best defense is a good offense.
[02:48:02.853 --> 02:48:14.377]  So if they strike first and take out the president and do a bunch of stuff, a lot of people I know, the military, you name it, aren't going to roll over to the globalists, the Democrats, the Fortune 100 people.
[02:48:14.377 --> 02:48:15.717]  And by the way, the globalists know that.
[02:48:15.717 --> 02:48:26.381]  Most of them have already fled to armored redoubts in undisclosed locations in Kauai, in Tasmania, in the Cook Islands, in Luxembourg, private areas of the Bahamas.
[02:48:27.449 --> 02:48:31.756]  Most of the time, their own security people hate them and know they're pedophiles and stuff.
[02:48:31.756 --> 02:48:38.909]  So, very quickly, once they've been isolated and are in their keeps, those keeps will be their graves.
[02:48:41.261 --> 02:48:43.223]  Without question, without question.
[02:48:43.223 --> 02:48:45.526]  And you said, you know, having a good offense.
[02:48:45.526 --> 02:48:51.933]  And, you know, we need to put on the full armor of God, but a lot of people have forgotten to use their swords.
[02:48:51.933 --> 02:48:54.776]  And I think that now more than ever, that's very, very important.
[02:48:54.776 --> 02:48:57.299]  We need to, you know, spread Christmas cheer.
[02:48:57.299 --> 02:48:59.341]  We need to be there for each other.
[02:48:59.341 --> 02:49:02.865]  I mean, is it the sword speaking out, telling the truth, taking action, being heard?
[02:49:02.865 --> 02:49:03.045]  Yes.
[02:49:04.835 --> 02:49:11.358]  We are truth-seekers, we are truth-bringers, and we gotta bring it now more than ever, whether it's through a microphone or a megaphone, brother.
[02:49:11.358 --> 02:49:11.918]  No, no, I agree.
[02:49:11.918 --> 02:49:16.060]  Whenever the lepers get in my face for no reason, they always want to say, you're a loser, you're a failure.
[02:49:16.060 --> 02:49:18.601]  They see my family, they go, I thought you didn't have your family!
[02:49:18.601 --> 02:49:19.861]  Screw them!
[02:49:19.861 --> 02:49:21.142]  What are you, screw your kids?
[02:49:21.142 --> 02:49:22.322]  They're imitating Satan.
[02:49:22.322 --> 02:49:23.643]  Oh, I mean, see, it's spiritual.
[02:49:23.643 --> 02:49:33.367]  They literally... Even if they don't get on their knees to the devil, they're these hateful... They want to run everything, they want to... And then that's who they are.
[02:49:34.105 --> 02:49:40.313]  And they just can't stand it when you just laugh at them and genuinely go, ha, ha, ha!
[02:49:40.313 --> 02:49:41.835]  They don't know what to do.
[02:49:41.835 --> 02:49:44.599]  And they go, ha, ha, ha!
[02:49:44.599 --> 02:49:47.943]  And just like run to their cars because someone actually stood up to them.
[02:49:50.055 --> 02:49:50.956]  Absolutely.
[02:49:50.956 --> 02:49:53.357]  Maybe they need some Christmas in their lives.
[02:49:53.357 --> 02:49:55.279]  Maybe they need Jesus in their lives.
[02:49:55.279 --> 02:49:57.640]  We can certainly bring that message to them.
[02:49:57.640 --> 02:49:58.301]  Well, that's it.
[02:49:58.301 --> 02:50:03.024]  I mean, if they wonder why their God isn't delivering, why they're so miserable, why don't they try something else?
[02:50:03.024 --> 02:50:09.168]  If their heart hasn't been completely turned over to evil, God isn't like the devil that comes in by force or manipulates you.
[02:50:09.168 --> 02:50:11.709]  You have to ask God into your heart.
[02:50:11.709 --> 02:50:12.070]  God.
[02:50:12.070 --> 02:50:13.571]  You have to ask Jesus into your heart.
[02:50:13.571 --> 02:50:14.371]  It's real.
[02:50:14.371 --> 02:50:15.452]  See what happens.
[02:50:15.452 --> 02:50:15.972]  God bless you.
[02:50:15.972 --> 02:50:16.853]  I appreciate your call, Reg.
[02:50:19.150 --> 02:50:21.331]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeff in Vancouver Island.
[02:50:21.331 --> 02:50:21.992]  Blab it up there.
[02:50:21.992 --> 02:50:22.972]  That is so pretty.
[02:50:22.972 --> 02:50:25.494]  Jeff, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:50:25.494 --> 02:50:27.535]  Hey, thanks, Alex.
[02:50:27.535 --> 02:50:30.917]  Just I want to echo what the last caller was saying.
[02:50:30.917 --> 02:50:37.481]  You know, I think the way I see it is I'm like I'm super jealous of your presence there.
[02:50:37.481 --> 02:50:39.603]  We've got we've got a long ways to go up here.
[02:50:39.603 --> 02:50:44.746]  But, you know, I just want to say the way I see it is.
[02:50:44.746 --> 02:50:48.148]  The cultivator has gone through the guard and the weeds are getting taken out.
[02:50:48.649 --> 02:51:04.035]  But it just is so imperative right now for Team Trump, Republicans, those that are awake, those that know God, to really plant what you can into that which has just been cultivated over.
[02:51:04.035 --> 02:51:08.197]  Because if you don't, there's just going to be another wave of weeds come.
[02:51:08.197 --> 02:51:08.677]  That's right.
[02:51:08.677 --> 02:51:10.118]  We have to plant seeds.
[02:51:10.848 --> 02:51:13.931]  We have to do that or the evil comes back over.
[02:51:13.931 --> 02:51:17.234]  The only thing that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men do nothing.
[02:51:17.234 --> 02:51:18.415]  You're absolutely right.
[02:51:18.415 --> 02:51:21.878]  That doesn't mean the fake little glitter bug preachers that just want to be rock stars.
[02:51:21.878 --> 02:51:25.120]  It means real men that are already satisfied, already have lives.
[02:51:25.120 --> 02:51:26.381]  We want to be left alone.
[02:51:26.381 --> 02:51:27.222]  We don't want power.
[02:51:27.222 --> 02:51:28.543]  Well, sorry.
[02:51:28.543 --> 02:51:36.310]  If we don't go out there and fill the gaps and at least educate others and find good leaders to be in positions, we're going to be controlled by these evil doers.
[02:51:37.552 --> 02:51:38.072]  Exactly.
[02:51:38.072 --> 02:51:46.716]  And you know, Trump, I saw an interview with Trump where he was sort of like a spectator watching and saying, you know, I'm not going to run for president if somebody steps up.
[02:51:46.716 --> 02:51:53.579]  But you know, he's the leader right now of taking people from a spectator into full action.
[02:51:53.579 --> 02:51:56.781]  And the stuff he's done in one year is mind blowing.
[02:51:56.781 --> 02:52:03.424]  And I want to say to everybody out there, what Trump needs is a team of people who that have dropped their NFL tickets, that have
[02:52:04.195 --> 02:52:04.595]  We're good
[02:52:21.587 --> 02:52:24.570]  No, I agree.
[02:52:24.570 --> 02:52:35.219]  The number one thing is getting back to the neighborhood barbecues, getting out of the system, getting out of sitting around and watching something that isn't even our family and making it the center of our lives.
[02:52:35.219 --> 02:52:36.180]  You're absolutely right.
[02:52:36.180 --> 02:52:38.082]  It is pure poison.
[02:52:38.082 --> 02:52:39.483]  All of it is.
[02:52:39.483 --> 02:52:40.765]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:52:40.765 --> 02:52:41.265]  God bless you.
[02:52:41.265 --> 02:52:42.206]  I appreciate you calling.
[02:52:43.067 --> 02:52:43.448]  I don't know.
[02:52:58.203 --> 02:53:02.305]  Everybody's in consensus with the baloney that they're spewing out.
[02:53:02.305 --> 02:53:05.087]  Deborah, you're up next in 70 seconds, and then Louis.
[02:53:05.087 --> 02:53:10.610]  Then I hand the baton to Mike Cernovich, straight ahead in hour number four, Infowars.com.
[02:53:10.610 --> 02:53:12.631]  Please spread that link, spread the articles.
[02:53:12.631 --> 02:53:21.316]  It's key to the fight.
[02:53:21.316 --> 02:53:23.877]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:53:26.713 --> 02:53:28.334]  You found it.
[02:53:28.334 --> 02:53:30.955]  The front lines of the human awakening.
[02:53:30.955 --> 02:53:32.996]  It's the Infowar.
[02:53:32.996 --> 02:53:35.257]  And now, Alex Jones.
[02:53:35.257 --> 02:53:38.238]  There must be some kind of way out of here.
[02:53:38.238 --> 02:53:41.280]  Hey, said the Joker to the thief.
[02:53:41.280 --> 02:53:43.961]  There's too much confusion.
[02:53:43.961 --> 02:53:45.982]  There's too much confusion.
[02:53:45.982 --> 02:53:48.363]  I can't get no relief.
[02:53:48.363 --> 02:53:49.644]  I can't get no relief.
[02:53:49.644 --> 02:53:52.045]  Well, there's relief there if you want it.
[02:53:52.045 --> 02:53:52.945]  And you see it happening.
[02:53:52.945 --> 02:53:54.726]  There's not just evil in the world.
[02:53:55.698 --> 02:53:58.039]  It's always darkest before the dawn.
[02:53:58.039 --> 02:54:00.740]  We got really serious things coming up.
[02:54:00.740 --> 02:54:09.083]  I want to focus on North Korea a lot because it's a very complex situation and the calculus is they're getting ready to hit North Korea.
[02:54:09.083 --> 02:54:10.684]  Maybe that's a negotiation point.
[02:54:10.684 --> 02:54:11.884]  I don't know, but I pray for peace.
[02:54:11.884 --> 02:54:13.905]  I know that personally.
[02:54:13.905 --> 02:54:14.345]  Good Lord.
[02:54:15.453 --> 02:54:17.334]  Deborah in Arizona, thanks for holding in Louis.
[02:54:17.334 --> 02:54:17.714]  Go ahead.
[02:54:17.714 --> 02:54:18.474]  You're on the air, Deborah.
[02:54:18.474 --> 02:54:19.594]  Appreciate you holding.
[02:54:19.594 --> 02:54:20.674]  Yes, Alex.
[02:54:20.674 --> 02:54:21.415]  Good afternoon.
[02:54:21.415 --> 02:54:24.976]  Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you and the Whole Info crew.
[02:54:24.976 --> 02:54:25.616]  Thank you.
[02:54:25.616 --> 02:54:30.377]  I wanted to start out by thanking you for your wonderful products.
[02:54:30.377 --> 02:54:34.978]  We've got some Prostagard, Silver Bullet, and Survival Shield.
[02:54:34.978 --> 02:54:39.380]  And thank you for giving my husband some sleep back.
[02:54:39.380 --> 02:54:40.020]  Wow.
[02:54:40.020 --> 02:54:41.700]  And for helping with my health.
[02:54:41.700 --> 02:54:43.341]  I'm a two-time cancer survivor.
[02:54:44.540 --> 02:54:47.322]  Well, just briefly, what did you notice with those products?
[02:54:47.322 --> 02:54:51.304]  Those are all well-documented, super high-quality products.
[02:54:51.304 --> 02:55:00.690]  Well, with the Prostagard, he was down to being able to sleep only an hour a night, and he's up to three hours a night, and he's only been on one bottle.
[02:55:00.690 --> 02:55:02.892]  Oh, is that because of swelling in the prostate, having to urinate?
[02:55:03.692 --> 02:55:04.453]  Yes.
[02:55:04.453 --> 02:55:09.977]  And so, just if you could imagine going from one to three hours sleep.
[02:55:09.977 --> 02:55:21.164]  Well, even the FDA that doesn't want people to make claims of supplements because the drug companies want to buy it all up, admits saw palmetto, there's no drug that works as good for your prostate and other glands as well.
[02:55:21.164 --> 02:55:24.547]  And then we've got six or seven other concentrated compounds
[02:55:25.007 --> 02:55:30.289]  Where I know people that have just thanked me on the street saying, man I was taking other stuff and it wasn't as strong.
[02:55:30.289 --> 02:55:31.169]  Why is this so good?
[02:55:31.169 --> 02:55:37.091]  I sleep through the night not having to urinate now on my prostate and I'm just saying, hey, it's what God gave us, salt palm meadow, you name it.
[02:55:37.091 --> 02:55:38.271]  So, thank you for the book.
[02:55:38.271 --> 02:55:39.151]  Right.
[02:55:39.151 --> 02:55:41.472]  Well, Big Pharma completely failed us.
[02:55:41.472 --> 02:55:44.093]  I mean, you know, it's just terrible.
[02:55:44.093 --> 02:55:52.195]  But I'm a two-time cancer survivor and I started taking the survival shield because I've had a lot of radiation, a lot of metals from chemo.
[02:55:53.235 --> 02:55:57.617]  And my thyroid is not good, so I need the iodine.
[02:55:57.617 --> 02:56:01.859]  And then the silver bullet, I'm hoping, will help bring me back.
[02:56:01.859 --> 02:56:03.920]  And I'm hoping to get vitamins eventually.
[02:56:03.920 --> 02:56:08.042]  It's just the... Did you get any good effects from the chloral silver?
[02:56:08.042 --> 02:56:10.803]  I mean, from the iodine?
[02:56:10.803 --> 02:56:16.205]  Yeah, I think I'm seeing some, Alex, and I'm very excited about that.
[02:56:16.205 --> 02:56:21.928]  I need to get a good vitamin B now, and I think I'll hopefully start feeling better than I have in a while.
[02:56:22.990 --> 02:56:26.371]  And so I really can't thank you enough for that.
[02:56:26.371 --> 02:56:28.511]  Ma'am, listen, listen, that's how we fund ourselves.
[02:56:28.511 --> 02:56:31.112]  And I want to sell something that works so people buy it again.
[02:56:31.112 --> 02:56:31.952]  Plus, I have family.
[02:56:31.952 --> 02:56:33.032]  My dad takes it.
[02:56:33.032 --> 02:56:34.692]  They say after 45, you can take it.
[02:56:34.692 --> 02:56:37.133]  Saul Palmetto, I'm starting to take it as well.
[02:56:37.133 --> 02:56:40.953]  We just go out, whenever it's documented to work, that's what we sell.
[02:56:40.953 --> 02:56:42.054]  So don't thank me.
[02:56:42.054 --> 02:56:44.174]  Thank you so much, Deborah.
[02:56:44.174 --> 02:56:48.975]  Well, and I thank Dr. Group for all of his research, because if he hadn't done that, well,
[02:56:52.708 --> 02:56:56.588]  Also, he just goes out and finds the very best organic sources, too.
[02:56:56.588 --> 02:57:05.551]  That's why we can't get it half the time, though, because he wants to make it so good, which I understand, but sometimes there's no such thing as perfection on the planet, because the planet's so toxic, you know what I mean?
[02:57:05.551 --> 02:57:06.731]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:57:06.731 --> 02:57:09.432]  Our food, our water, and our air are just horrible.
[02:57:09.432 --> 02:57:19.734]  Arizona's been geoengineered to no end for the last two months, and I finally wrote to President Trump and to our governor, who I will not vote for their governor again.
[02:57:20.771 --> 02:57:31.174]  Because he either has no clue or he's part of the wrong side of the team, but he's a Republican.
[02:57:31.174 --> 02:57:33.315]  That's what I wanted to talk to you about today.
[02:57:33.315 --> 02:57:40.897]  Alex, we cannot afford to sigh relief just because we got a tax break.
[02:57:40.897 --> 02:57:49.300]  My big, huge concern, and I hope you can help all the people with this, is that we have got to take our voting back.
[02:57:50.570 --> 02:58:01.359]  Tucker Carlson had Mayeron from Maryland the other day who had said that they passed a law in Maryland in whatever town or city he was in.
[02:58:01.359 --> 02:58:04.002]  Hold on, I'm going to finish up with you, Debra, and then I promise to go to Lewis.
[02:58:04.002 --> 02:58:06.164]  And Mike Service is taking over, but he doesn't know how to be a right shotgun.
[02:58:06.164 --> 02:58:09.327]  I want you to be able to finish your point because, absolutely, election fraud has been proven.
[02:58:09.327 --> 02:58:12.930]  They made fun of Trump for talking about it because they know it's their Achilles heel.
[02:58:12.930 --> 02:58:13.691]  It's their only hope.
[02:58:15.402 --> 02:58:19.806]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[02:58:19.806 --> 02:58:27.893]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[02:58:27.893 --> 02:58:33.197]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[02:58:33.197 --> 02:58:35.719]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[02:58:35.719 --> 02:58:39.943]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[02:58:39.943 --> 02:58:42.385]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[02:58:43.047 --> 02:58:50.293]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[02:58:50.293 --> 02:58:58.359]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[02:58:58.359 --> 02:59:05.544]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[02:59:05.544 --> 02:59:07.005]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[02:59:07.005 --> 02:59:08.827]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[02:59:09.637 --> 02:59:13.100]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now.
[02:59:13.100 --> 02:59:17.203]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[02:59:17.203 --> 02:59:21.766]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:59:53.650 --> 02:59:59.493]  All right, Debra in Arizona, you were getting into election fraud and I gotta say I'm very proud of Tucker Carlson.
[02:59:59.493 --> 03:00:07.076]  Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson just are so dead on, so hardcore with their research, so ahead of the curve of any other mainstream media.
[03:00:07.076 --> 03:00:15.020]  They're the only thing on broadcast TV or cable television, because they're on some local stations that broadcast it, that tells the truth.
[03:00:15.020 --> 03:00:16.881]  And it's very refreshing.
[03:00:16.881 --> 03:00:18.442]  I'm not in competition with mainstream media.
[03:00:18.442 --> 03:00:22.684]  I wish it was all good and we could, you know, live in the future together and have a great world.
[03:00:23.480 --> 03:00:25.761]  Uh, but no, that's not the case.
[03:00:25.761 --> 03:00:27.701]  Most of it, as we know, is horrible.
[03:00:27.701 --> 03:00:28.982]  Fox Business has some great shows.
[03:00:28.982 --> 03:00:31.542]  I think Lou Dobbs ought to be on regular Fox.
[03:00:31.542 --> 03:00:33.083]  Uh, Varney ought to be on regular Fox.
[03:00:33.083 --> 03:00:37.604]  I mean, those are good libertarian people that care about prosperity, care about the truth.
[03:00:37.604 --> 03:00:42.966]  Uh, but when you sit there and you look at all the other fake conservatives and fake liberals, it's truly sickening.
[03:00:42.966 --> 03:00:47.727]  And remember, we had the Pew Research and a bunch of others that showed over three and a half million illegals voted.
[03:00:48.907 --> 03:00:50.749]  And Trump went with that number.
[03:00:50.749 --> 03:01:01.697]  Well, instead of saying Pew and George Washington University and all these others, they just went, Jones claims it, and Trump went with it, like I'm this discredited figure.
[03:01:01.697 --> 03:01:03.158]  So, that's the tactic.
[03:01:03.158 --> 03:01:12.965]  Over here, I'm covering all these studies and all the research and all the facts of the past election and the current election and what had just happened, and I'm saying, yeah, it's over 3 million.
[03:01:12.965 --> 03:01:16.888]  Then Trump reports on that, and they go, he got it from Alex Jones!
[03:01:17.734 --> 03:01:27.199]  To make it sound like it's discrediting, and then the actual numbers came out this year from Harvard, it was over 7 million potential people voting the names of dead people.
[03:01:27.199 --> 03:01:32.261]  They know that happened, they just didn't get each specific instance broken down.
[03:01:32.261 --> 03:01:33.782]  So it's much worse than we thought.
[03:01:33.782 --> 03:01:39.104]  The Democrats have passed laws all over to let illegals vote, and the Feds come in and say they can't do it.
[03:01:41.431 --> 03:01:49.456]  It's amazing, and you got out-of-state voters coming in, you got Hillary stealing the nomination from Sanders, where he'd win states if she'd just take the delegates.
[03:01:49.456 --> 03:01:54.120]  I mean, their stonewalling doesn't work anymore.
[03:01:54.120 --> 03:02:01.605]  But you're right, they definitely, and I don't want to die on that hill, as one of the producers said, of the Roy Moore thing, because we were all just sick of hearing about it.
[03:02:01.605 --> 03:02:03.446]  We all had Roy Moore fatigue, not in a bad way.
[03:02:04.733 --> 03:02:07.835]  But, yeah, they had a bunch of people from outside the state coming in voting.
[03:02:07.835 --> 03:02:09.215]  They're on video bragging.
[03:02:09.215 --> 03:02:12.297]  They had him saying he'd lose by 10 to 15 points in all the polls.
[03:02:12.297 --> 03:02:13.417]  Then he lost by half a point.
[03:02:13.417 --> 03:02:16.499]  That's a way to lie so people think, oh, I better bandwagon.
[03:02:16.499 --> 03:02:19.501]  You know, if he's gonna lose, I better vote for the winner.
[03:02:19.501 --> 03:02:21.381]  So, a lot of stuff happened.
[03:02:21.381 --> 03:02:23.062]  Of course Roy Moore won.
[03:02:23.062 --> 03:02:26.324]  You think Alabamans want a bunch of outsiders telling them what to do?
[03:02:26.324 --> 03:02:29.486]  So, it's, I mean, it's a ruby red state.
[03:02:29.486 --> 03:02:31.387]  And the evidence shows that they stole it.
[03:02:31.387 --> 03:02:31.947]  They stole
[03:02:33.519 --> 03:02:36.882]  I always get it flipped, because the memory doesn't serve.
[03:02:36.882 --> 03:02:41.626]  They stole five states, and Hillary tried to steal six others.
[03:02:41.626 --> 03:02:43.108]  Local state governments confirmed.
[03:02:43.108 --> 03:02:46.351]  Homeland Security, the Justice Department, was breaking in.
[03:02:46.351 --> 03:02:49.894]  Loretta Lynch was breaking into the computers, live time, trying to flip it.
[03:02:49.894 --> 03:02:54.018]  They were like, we have Justice Department ISPs hitting us!
[03:02:55.097 --> 03:03:05.145]  Not to mention the buses with illegals coming to vote, and the buses with people voting in dead people's names, which the Democrats all got caught on tape scores of times by Veritas and everybody else, but Obama went on TV!
[03:03:05.145 --> 03:03:08.487]  And he told people that were illegally to go vote.
[03:03:08.487 --> 03:03:18.115]  So yes, we know what's going on, and you're right, Debra, all these states have passed that were no IDs needed, so they can look at the obituary, hand out the names, and have them vote ten times.
[03:03:18.115 --> 03:03:19.175]  So how do you counter that?
[03:03:19.175 --> 03:03:23.899]  Because I think your concern is one of their main ways they're going to get us, and we'll talk to Lewis in California.
[03:03:24.662 --> 03:03:25.984]  Well, that is my concern.
[03:03:25.984 --> 03:03:41.681]  I have called down to the Board of Elections all the way back in 2007 and said, hey, you know, how can I be assured that our votes are being counted and that they are by citizens of the United States?
[03:03:41.681 --> 03:03:43.823]  Because like you, I'm in a border state, Alex.
[03:03:43.823 --> 03:03:44.504]  I have seen
[03:03:45.612 --> 03:03:51.196]  For 20 years or more, people pouring into our state.
[03:03:51.196 --> 03:03:53.517]  Pouring into our state.
[03:03:53.517 --> 03:04:05.585]  And Sheriff Joe Arpaio tried to enforce the laws that the Arizona people passed, SB 1070, and Jan Brewer was in office, and Obama came out and shut it down.
[03:04:05.585 --> 03:04:12.470]  And everything that we've tried to do for the last 20 years, they have stopped it.
[03:04:13.209 --> 03:04:14.810]  And it's backfired on us.
[03:04:14.810 --> 03:04:17.211]  Now, we are running out of time.
[03:04:17.211 --> 03:04:24.373]  I think the single most important thing that we can do to help our president is to have people get out there and run for office.
[03:04:24.373 --> 03:04:31.256]  I don't care if I vote for Farmer Joe at this point, before I vote for the people that are currently in office on both sides of the fence.
[03:04:32.208 --> 03:04:34.589]  A lot of them are bad.
[03:04:34.589 --> 03:04:38.011]  And if you run for office, you can educate people about the topics, even if you don't win.
[03:04:38.011 --> 03:04:38.791]  Great point, Debra.
[03:04:38.791 --> 03:04:40.832]  God bless you, and I appreciate your support.
[03:04:40.832 --> 03:04:41.513]  I really do.
[03:04:41.513 --> 03:04:43.494]  Again, Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
[03:04:43.494 --> 03:04:45.755]  Be safe with this big holiday coming up.
[03:04:45.755 --> 03:04:47.135]  Lewis in California, thanks for holding.
[03:04:47.135 --> 03:04:52.258]  By the way, Cernovich is late with an engagement, getting to the mic, so I'm not taking over his time here.
[03:04:52.258 --> 03:04:53.779]  We like Mike doing the show.
[03:04:53.779 --> 03:04:55.219]  Oh, Nick, there he is now, so we've got a break.
[03:04:55.219 --> 03:04:56.580]  We're going to come back to him.
[03:04:56.580 --> 03:04:58.501]  So, Lewis in California, go ahead and finish up.
[03:04:58.501 --> 03:05:00.282]  I'm going to hand the baton to Mike Cernovich.
[03:05:00.282 --> 03:05:00.542]  Go ahead.
[03:05:01.840 --> 03:05:03.581]  Thank you, Alex, for your time.
[03:05:03.581 --> 03:05:09.585]  I'm sitting here looking at a picture of a Norman Rockwell painting of an old Christmas traditional.
[03:05:09.585 --> 03:05:13.868]  It's all warm and fuzzy, got a little kitty by the fire and all that.
[03:05:13.868 --> 03:05:29.618]  And I remember these images from when I was a child of Christmas, and all these images have been distorted by the media strategically since we were children and then replaced with anti-Christian imagery.
[03:05:30.425 --> 03:05:33.527]  In a very diabolical way.
[03:05:33.527 --> 03:05:44.452]  And very similar patterns of this imagery have shown up in false flag and terrorist events in our country.
[03:05:44.452 --> 03:05:53.617]  For example, the Kennedy assassination, or 9-11, or the Las Vegas shootings, or the Aurora Theater shootings.
[03:05:53.617 --> 03:05:57.479]  These are all extremely rich in symbolism.
[03:05:58.186 --> 03:06:06.670]  In a way that could not be done by a single lone wolf of perpetrators.
[03:06:06.670 --> 03:06:19.175]  They're using computers and satellites and high tech to terrify the public with the media and still steal our humanness.
[03:06:19.878 --> 03:06:20.218]  I promise.
[03:06:39.012 --> 03:06:49.076]  What do you make of the tax cuts and all the crazy stuff happening and Schmidt stepping down and just and just the flamethrower tether editing tapes of you and Editing tapes of me.
[03:06:49.076 --> 03:06:51.657]  We haven't I see something about me totally edited notice.
[03:06:51.657 --> 03:06:54.638]  There's no video It's always like edited where we're saying these things.
[03:06:54.638 --> 03:06:57.719]  We never said we were hypothetically talking about things.
[03:06:57.719 --> 03:07:00.520]  I mean they are Going to the next level right now.
[03:07:00.520 --> 03:07:01.240]  They're really desperate
[03:07:02.463 --> 03:07:10.294]  Yeah, I just held what many people are calling the most successful AMA in Reddit history, so that's why I was a little bit late.
[03:07:10.294 --> 03:07:17.744]  And, you know, I think you should do one too, maybe, because yours will be even bigger, just like yours was the number one podcast ever for Joe Rogan.
[03:07:17.744 --> 03:07:18.945]  And what they've done now...
[03:07:19.926 --> 03:07:28.729]  And this is a deep state funded operation, of course, is you and I, like, we'll do a podcast and I'll go, oh, yeah, Alex, like, you know me, I hate women.
[03:07:28.729 --> 03:07:33.310]  And then they'll clip that and they'll go, oh, my God, you know, here's Cernovich and Alex.
[03:07:33.310 --> 03:07:40.232]  And it's like, no, no, we're we're making fun of people who say that or think we say that and they create these soundboards.
[03:07:40.232 --> 03:07:41.853]  But the reason it's backfiring
[03:07:42.782 --> 03:07:51.227]  Is that their fabrications have become so elaborate that no intelligent, rational person will believe anything.
[03:07:51.227 --> 03:07:53.888]  So you and I, we're both mortals.
[03:07:53.888 --> 03:07:54.789]  We're not gods.
[03:07:54.789 --> 03:07:56.330]  We're just humble men.
[03:07:56.330 --> 03:07:58.071]  We will eventually falter.
[03:07:58.743 --> 03:08:08.171]  But when we do, nobody's even going to believe that because there have been so many outright lies and fabrications about us that people will go, oh, what's that, like another edited video?
[03:08:08.171 --> 03:08:09.713]  What's that, like another Photoshop?
[03:08:09.713 --> 03:08:12.115]  Oh, you know, more fake news articles.
[03:08:12.115 --> 03:08:17.900]  So it's actually backfiring on them because now nobody will believe anything bad about us.
[03:08:17.900 --> 03:08:18.360]  So I'm very grateful.
[03:08:18.360 --> 03:08:21.022]  Well, just like the women that have been taping people offering them money.
[03:08:21.022 --> 03:08:22.324]  Lie about Trump, quarter million.
[03:08:22.324 --> 03:08:23.785]  I mean, it's just pure bull.
[03:08:25.091 --> 03:08:31.955]  Yeah, false accusations are the best thing that can happen to a public figure because then nobody will believe anything.
[03:08:31.955 --> 03:08:36.337]  They're just like, oh, wow, you know, we're so used to these people being lied about.
[03:08:36.337 --> 03:08:40.239]  We're so used to these people being fabricated about that.
[03:08:40.239 --> 03:08:43.381]  Why would I believe anything negative anybody actually says?
[03:08:43.381 --> 03:08:46.643]  So it's actually very helpful for us.
[03:08:46.643 --> 03:08:47.843]  And I welcome the attacks.
[03:08:47.843 --> 03:08:51.145]  And that's why I like the attacks and hope they keep coming.
[03:08:51.145 --> 03:08:51.965]  We don't just say that.
[03:08:51.965 --> 03:08:53.806]  They always think we just say that to act tough.
[03:08:53.806 --> 03:08:54.607]  These fake attacks.
[03:08:55.316 --> 03:09:01.561]  Made this year bigger than last year for audience, everything for InfoWars, so thank you New World Order, and they still just don't get it.

[03:13:49.617 --> 03:13:55.983]  Back, Mike Cernovich, here with the biggest Reddit AMA ever held in history.
[03:13:55.983 --> 03:14:00.626]  People are saying it was the most promoted by media and journalists.
[03:14:00.626 --> 03:14:01.447]  They're writing about it.
[03:14:01.447 --> 03:14:05.070]  It's like the biggest story of the day right now.
[03:14:05.070 --> 03:14:08.113]  And it's pretty amazing, actually.
[03:14:08.113 --> 03:14:10.075]  Almost 2,000 comments already.
[03:14:10.075 --> 03:14:13.517]  So that was why I was a little bit late for my show appearance.
[03:14:13.517 --> 03:14:15.079]  I wanted to talk to all of you, of course.
[03:14:15.999 --> 03:14:33.410]  But I wanted to do the AMA, and I hope Alex does one too, because what we're doing is we really allow the left to show their true colors and show how unhinged they are by posting over thousands of comments, tweets, articles.
[03:14:33.410 --> 03:14:35.972]  It's now like the biggest story of the day, but the truth is that
[03:14:38.206 --> 03:14:39.788]  Why am I the news?
[03:14:39.788 --> 03:14:42.111]  Why is Alex Jones the news?
[03:14:42.111 --> 03:14:51.581]  Why won't the media break real stories of consequence like the John Conyers story, like the Susan Rice unmasking scandal?
[03:14:51.581 --> 03:14:57.248]  They are really just gossip boys and gossip girls who don't want to do
[03:14:58.280 --> 03:14:59.641]  Real journalism.
[03:14:59.641 --> 03:15:09.387]  Yeah, so here's the New York, New York Magazine, a very prestigious publication is saying, Cernovich, he's melting down because they think that downvoting me, right?
[03:15:09.387 --> 03:15:14.010]  By the way, I wore, so my daughter, a lot of people asked me what I was wearing the bandana.
[03:15:14.010 --> 03:15:20.634]  My daughter had a bandana on and she kind of came in and I thought, I'm going to wear this because I knew that that would mean it.
[03:15:20.634 --> 03:15:23.176]  So I knew that if I wore that,
[03:15:23.991 --> 03:15:30.296]  Then it would trigger them and then they would be like, because this is me in a suit, obviously, I could have worn a suit for the AMA.
[03:15:30.296 --> 03:15:34.659]  But I knew if I wore that bandana, they would think, oh, my God, Cernovich is melting down.
[03:15:34.659 --> 03:15:36.100]  You know, we really got him good.
[03:15:36.100 --> 03:15:37.081]  He's so owned.
[03:15:37.081 --> 03:15:39.342]  We're just, you know, he can't handle it.
[03:15:39.342 --> 03:15:40.743]  He can't take it.
[03:15:40.743 --> 03:15:43.806]  Well, that's how you get them talking about you.
[03:15:43.806 --> 03:15:44.967]  That's how we share the message.
[03:15:44.967 --> 03:15:46.748]  This is what people don't understand about Alex.
[03:15:47.392 --> 03:15:48.853]  This is what they don't understand about me.
[03:15:48.853 --> 03:15:59.020]  This is what they don't understand about the amazing production work that they do at InfoWars that you're listening to right now is, you know, remember that Alex Fidget Spinner video?
[03:15:59.020 --> 03:16:02.083]  That's the kind of thing that is something for everyone.
[03:16:02.083 --> 03:16:06.426]  If you hate Alex Jones, you think, what an idiot.
[03:16:06.426 --> 03:16:07.907]  I can't believe how dumb he looks.
[03:16:07.907 --> 03:16:09.288]  He thinks he's cool.
[03:16:09.288 --> 03:16:10.629]  This is so stupid.
[03:16:10.629 --> 03:16:11.730]  I can't believe it.
[03:16:11.730 --> 03:16:13.311]  Oh my God, look at that guy.
[03:16:13.311 --> 03:16:14.732]  Dummy, dummy, idiot, idiot.
[03:16:15.399 --> 03:16:17.219]  So then they share the video.
[03:16:17.219 --> 03:16:22.200]  And then people who like Alex go, you know, I like that Alex doesn't take himself seriously.
[03:16:22.200 --> 03:16:23.721]  I like that he can just goof off.
[03:16:23.721 --> 03:16:25.401]  I like that he can just have fun.
[03:16:25.401 --> 03:16:28.381]  So then those people who like him share it.
[03:16:28.381 --> 03:16:30.502]  And so that's what I did with that picture there.
[03:16:30.502 --> 03:16:33.202]  So I go, I'm just going to wear a big goofy bandana.
[03:16:33.202 --> 03:16:38.103]  And the people who like me and you know, know how nice I look in a suit are going to say, Oh, that's funny.
[03:16:38.103 --> 03:16:41.044]  You know, he took that off his daughter and isn't that goofy.
[03:16:41.044 --> 03:16:42.564]  He's not afraid to have a little bit of fun.
[03:16:43.467 --> 03:16:46.869]  And then the haters are going to say, oh my god, he melted down.
[03:16:46.869 --> 03:16:48.090]  We really got him good.
[03:16:48.090 --> 03:16:49.431]  He's so unhinged.
[03:16:49.431 --> 03:16:49.971]  Look at him.
[03:16:49.971 --> 03:16:51.452]  Look at that bandana.
[03:16:51.452 --> 03:16:52.132]  Can't believe it.
[03:16:52.132 --> 03:16:53.593]  What a freak show and everything.
[03:16:53.593 --> 03:16:55.334]  That's how we share our message.
[03:16:55.334 --> 03:16:57.775]  It's a Trojan horse, we call it.
[03:16:57.775 --> 03:17:02.618]  Yeah, as you remember, the great warriors like Achilles, right?
[03:17:02.618 --> 03:17:08.602]  The great Trojan horse story was that if you want to get into the town of the enemy,
[03:17:09.984 --> 03:17:14.706]  Then you can go directly and try to break down the gates.
[03:17:14.706 --> 03:17:16.567]  Or you can offer a gift.
[03:17:16.567 --> 03:17:17.528]  You can offer a gift.
[03:17:17.528 --> 03:17:24.451]  And so Achilles and the great warriors, they went up into the body of a wooden horse and it was left as a gift.
[03:17:24.451 --> 03:17:31.254]  They even said to the enemy, the Greeks said to the enemies, we are giving you a gift as a surrendering, right?
[03:17:31.254 --> 03:17:35.036]  We will give you this beautiful horse and then they fled.
[03:17:36.204 --> 03:17:42.306]  And then the people who are like the mainstream media are saying, we must take this gift into the city.
[03:17:42.306 --> 03:17:48.527]  And the young people, the warriors, they said, Father, no, don't, Hector, you know, Father, don't, please.
[03:17:48.527 --> 03:17:49.508]  This is a trap.
[03:17:49.508 --> 03:17:51.168]  Don't allow this in here.
[03:17:51.168 --> 03:17:56.289]  They said, no, the wise men, the wise men would be Dan Rather, Ted Koppel.
[03:17:56.289 --> 03:18:00.331]  Remember, they brought Ted Koppel back from a crypt on the Megyn Kelly thing.
[03:18:00.331 --> 03:18:04.252]  So Ted Koppel and Ted Kelly, I don't even know these people's names.
[03:18:04.252 --> 03:18:05.372]  That's how outdated they are.
[03:18:06.129 --> 03:18:08.370]  They said, allow the horse to come in as a gift.
[03:18:08.370 --> 03:18:10.010]  It shows that they've lost.
[03:18:10.010 --> 03:18:13.172]  And then, of course, once the horse was in, the gates were closed.
[03:18:13.172 --> 03:18:18.874]  And then while the people slept, Achilles and the great warriors came out and conquered the city.
[03:18:18.874 --> 03:18:25.056]  Well, in this information war that we're in, we are conquering minds of the adversaries.
[03:18:25.586 --> 03:18:30.355]  Because they're going, Oh my God, look how ridiculous Alex Jones is with the fidget spinner.
[03:18:30.355 --> 03:18:34.222]  Look how ridiculous Alex Jones is with that folk song, right?
[03:18:34.222 --> 03:18:38.310]  Remember, you know, the production team and Rob and everybody does such great work.
[03:18:39.011 --> 03:18:40.251]  They go, oh, look at this video.
[03:18:40.251 --> 03:18:41.732]  Alex looks like a buffoon.
[03:18:41.732 --> 03:18:43.012]  We'll share this.
[03:18:43.012 --> 03:18:45.653]  Let's show everybody this video, right?
[03:18:45.653 --> 03:18:49.534]  Let's show this picture of Cernovich with a pink do-rag on his head.
[03:18:49.534 --> 03:18:51.974]  They're probably, you know, yeah, there's video.
[03:18:51.974 --> 03:18:53.295]  She sleeps in the same room.
[03:18:53.295 --> 03:18:59.717]  So the production team makes these beautiful videos that the enemy shares.
[03:18:59.717 --> 03:19:01.917]  They don't realize that's a Trojan horse.
[03:19:01.917 --> 03:19:07.299]  The enemy has now allowed in Alex Jones in through the gates and to the minds of the enemy.
[03:19:07.299 --> 03:19:08.619]  So now the enemy right now
[03:19:09.389 --> 03:19:11.269]  They're saying, look at Cernovich in the do-rag.
[03:19:11.269 --> 03:19:13.230]  They're probably going to say that it's racist.
[03:19:13.230 --> 03:19:14.170]  I can predict it right now.
[03:19:14.170 --> 03:19:21.971]  They're going to go, oh, Cernovich is wearing a do-rag, which is like a stereotype thing, probably coded racism.
[03:19:21.971 --> 03:19:24.852]  It's a coded dog whistle to his followers.
[03:19:24.852 --> 03:19:26.132]  I guarantee you they're going to say that.
[03:19:26.132 --> 03:19:29.633]  It's another reason I put it on, because you know what they're going to do before they do it.
[03:19:29.633 --> 03:19:36.774]  But they don't realize that I now have the enemy bringing me and my message into their city.
[03:19:37.426 --> 03:19:39.908]  So I didn't have to fight them for that.
[03:19:39.908 --> 03:19:44.951]  I didn't have to go with the battering rams and all of my soldiers and try to break down the gate.
[03:19:44.951 --> 03:19:46.272]  I just gave them a gift.
[03:19:46.272 --> 03:19:47.453]  I said, here's me.
[03:19:48.234 --> 03:19:51.397]  Wearing a do-rag, don't I look silly, oh my god.
[03:19:51.397 --> 03:19:56.982]  And then during the AMA I was like, screamin', stop the hammering, I was throwing around little memes.
[03:19:56.982 --> 03:20:04.669]  So now they're gonna edit videos of me yelling and saying, oh my god, look at Cernovich, he's yelling at everybody, he's so, he's unhinged, can you believe this guy?
[03:20:04.669 --> 03:20:09.513]  And meanwhile Shauna was laying down the whole time just laughing, because she knew what was going on.
[03:20:10.672 --> 03:20:17.879]  So rather than just batter down the gates, which takes so much energy and is a misuse of energy, I just give them a gift.
[03:20:17.879 --> 03:20:26.849]  I say, look at me, look at me, show me, show me how or show your people how badly I've been owned.
[03:20:26.849 --> 03:20:28.470]  Spread my message.
[03:20:28.470 --> 03:20:32.875]  Every media outlet in the world is going to have to cover this AMA because it's the biggest story in the world.
[03:20:33.675 --> 03:20:38.278]  Just like that Sam Cedar story, which we're going to talk about Jink in the next segment.
[03:20:38.278 --> 03:20:48.024]  So we're going to talk about Sam Cedar, Jink, and all the stuff that they actually wrote, that they actually wrote talking about, you know, 14 year old girls, very, very bad things.
[03:20:48.024 --> 03:20:51.046]  We're going to do a whole segment on this because it's very important.
[03:20:51.046 --> 03:20:54.108]  The fake news media doesn't want to cover this story.
[03:20:54.108 --> 03:20:55.149]  So we're going to talk about that.
[03:20:55.149 --> 03:20:58.951]  It all ties in with Sam Cedar.
[03:20:58.951 --> 03:21:00.252]  That just got
[03:21:01.400 --> 03:21:03.601]  Me introduced to way more people.
[03:21:03.601 --> 03:21:07.622]  They're saying your own Sam Seder and MSNBC, they owned you.
[03:21:07.622 --> 03:21:09.522]  Reddit, the AMA, it owned you.
[03:21:09.522 --> 03:21:20.125]  Oh my God, yes, you're writing about me, spreading my image and my message to all of your people who would probably never read me or hear about me.
[03:21:20.125 --> 03:21:25.547]  Some of them are going to laugh, but a large percentage are going to say, hey, that guy looks kind of fun.
[03:21:25.547 --> 03:21:27.768]  That guy looks like he doesn't take himself seriously.
[03:21:27.768 --> 03:21:29.268]  Unlike all these fake news people who are
[03:21:29.918 --> 03:21:32.620]  You know, hi, I'm very important, and I'm here to tell you the news.
[03:21:32.620 --> 03:21:36.383]  I'm Ted Koppel, and what I say is truth, and everything is a lie.
[03:21:36.383 --> 03:21:37.103]  I'm DeAnne Rather.
[03:21:37.103 --> 03:21:41.426]  We're very, very, very serious people, and everything you say, you must take on a word.
[03:21:41.426 --> 03:21:46.009]  So their own followers are going to see me just goofing off, having a good time.
[03:21:46.009 --> 03:21:48.371]  There's Alex and DeAnne.
[03:21:48.371 --> 03:21:49.632]  They see us having fun.
[03:21:50.743 --> 03:21:52.605]  And then they go, I want to go have fun.
[03:21:52.605 --> 03:21:57.270]  I'm tired of these smug, boring people with their doom and gloom message.
[03:21:57.270 --> 03:21:59.633]  I want to talk to the guy with the fidget spinner.
[03:21:59.633 --> 03:22:02.396]  I want to talk to the guy with the pink do-rag.
[03:22:02.396 --> 03:22:06.200]  I want to talk to the people that don't take themselves seriously and they laugh.
[03:22:06.200 --> 03:22:09.704]  And I want to talk to you after break.
[03:22:09.704 --> 03:22:11.045]  We have a lot to talk about.
[03:22:11.045 --> 03:22:12.627]  I'll see you in a few minutes.
[03:22:16.452 --> 03:22:17.933]  Hello, Mr. Anderson.

[03:25:20.051 --> 03:25:29.415]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[03:25:30.538 --> 03:25:37.003]  And as a long-time InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[03:25:37.003 --> 03:25:39.265]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[03:25:39.265 --> 03:25:40.326]  Thank you.
[03:25:40.326 --> 03:25:42.829]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[03:25:42.829 --> 03:25:47.132]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[03:25:47.132 --> 03:25:50.155]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[03:25:50.155 --> 03:25:51.476]  They are quality.
[03:25:51.476 --> 03:25:53.218]  I can't wait to get some more.
[03:25:53.218 --> 03:25:56.101]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[03:25:56.101 --> 03:25:56.561]  Absolutely.
[03:25:57.161 --> 03:26:18.466]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[03:26:18.466 --> 03:26:21.147]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:26:30.906 --> 03:26:33.568]  News, analysis, reports.
[03:26:33.568 --> 03:26:35.810]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:26:35.810 --> 03:26:38.733]  And now, your host, Mike Cernovich.
[03:26:40.914 --> 03:26:41.895]  And we're back.
[03:26:41.895 --> 03:26:45.817]  Mike Cernovich, doing a little bit of reading in real time.
[03:26:45.817 --> 03:26:51.301]  I'm right now, the biggest story in the world, all because I went onto Reddit and did an AMA.
[03:26:51.301 --> 03:26:52.622]  So I'm having a good time.
[03:26:52.622 --> 03:26:54.423]  I was reading the articles on break.
[03:26:54.423 --> 03:26:56.665]  They are saying that I was dunked on.
[03:26:56.665 --> 03:27:01.228]  They were saying that going and doing the Reddit AMA was a complete backfire.
[03:27:01.228 --> 03:27:03.910]  They're saying that I was owned.
[03:27:03.910 --> 03:27:06.672]  They go, one person asked me, aren't you ashamed?
[03:27:06.672 --> 03:27:09.254]  Pro-Trump conspiracy troll gets hilariously
[03:27:10.126 --> 03:27:10.927]  Smackdown.
[03:27:10.927 --> 03:27:12.768]  This is what I love about the left.
[03:27:12.768 --> 03:27:17.431]  And this is why we can win as long as you keep up the fight and you keep supporting the end for one.
[03:27:17.431 --> 03:27:19.532]  I'll tell you why.
[03:27:19.532 --> 03:27:23.735]  I have told them my plan in advance.
[03:27:23.735 --> 03:27:26.576]  Alex and I have told our plans in advance.
[03:27:26.576 --> 03:27:30.739]  We've told them the story of the Trojan horse and how what we're really doing.
[03:27:31.767 --> 03:27:32.768]  It's a story of a Trojan horse.
[03:27:32.768 --> 03:27:39.157]  By the way, some of you watching on YouTube Live have noticed and you've told me that I have a hair sticking out on the top of my head.
[03:27:39.157 --> 03:27:42.942]  And the thing is, I'm too busy to get a haircut.
[03:27:42.942 --> 03:27:44.644]  So, I need to get a haircut.
[03:27:44.644 --> 03:27:45.565]  I know I do.
[03:27:45.565 --> 03:27:49.831]  But I'm just too busy to get a haircut because when you're fighting the end for war all the time,
[03:27:50.726 --> 03:27:53.047]  You don't have time to get a haircut.
[03:27:53.047 --> 03:27:53.928]  That's just my life.
[03:27:53.928 --> 03:27:58.570]  Maybe, you know, maybe one day I'll have my own private salon or something like that.
[03:27:58.570 --> 03:28:00.911]  But that's why your support is so important.
[03:28:00.911 --> 03:28:03.692]  And there are some great specials going on.
[03:28:03.692 --> 03:28:11.196]  Because your support, you fund the Endful Wars, you fund your own life, you improve your own life.
[03:28:11.196 --> 03:28:12.096]  Everybody wins.
[03:28:12.702 --> 03:28:22.346]  When you shop at the InfoWars store and go to InfoWarsStore.com, it's so key that people do this because this is what keeps everything going on.
[03:28:22.346 --> 03:28:24.927]  And it's a win for you also.
[03:28:24.927 --> 03:28:30.709]  So right now we definitely have some big specials for Christmas.
[03:28:30.709 --> 03:28:31.690]  Very, very big deal.
[03:28:31.690 --> 03:28:34.371]  And along with the new product called Carnivore.
[03:28:35.484 --> 03:28:37.805]  So Carnivore is an enzyme formula.
[03:28:37.805 --> 03:28:39.225]  I haven't even tried it yet.
[03:28:39.225 --> 03:28:41.846]  It's so new that I haven't even tried it yet.
[03:28:41.846 --> 03:28:49.049]  But a lot of people have poor digestion and poor digestive enzymes due to not having a proper diet.
[03:28:49.049 --> 03:28:53.171]  So when you go from the standard American or a sad diet, it's called a better diet.
[03:28:53.171 --> 03:28:57.432]  A lot of times you have issues and that's what these enzymes and stuff are for.
[03:28:57.432 --> 03:28:58.613]  And they're great.
[03:28:58.613 --> 03:29:01.494]  I've taken many different brands of digestive enzymes.
[03:29:01.494 --> 03:29:02.474]  Very, very important.
[03:29:02.474 --> 03:29:04.615]  Very, very powerful right now.
[03:29:05.771 --> 03:29:07.153]  And that's what keeps the InfoWars going.
[03:29:07.153 --> 03:29:11.077]  And by the way, people ask, how do I have so much energy, right?
[03:29:11.077 --> 03:29:12.238]  All the time I get that.
[03:29:12.238 --> 03:29:14.661]  Well, because I take care of myself.
[03:29:14.661 --> 03:29:16.663]  I take nutritional products.
[03:29:16.663 --> 03:29:17.964]  I take the protein powders.
[03:29:17.964 --> 03:29:19.606]  I take the caveman formula.
[03:29:19.606 --> 03:29:22.710]  I take the bone broth to function at the level.
[03:29:22.710 --> 03:29:24.131]  I mean, I write last night.
[03:29:24.131 --> 03:29:26.574]  If you're on the email list, you know that you received an email.
[03:29:27.910 --> 03:29:29.591]  Private list only for now.
[03:29:29.591 --> 03:29:36.057]  An email for a Night of Freedom, a nightforfreedom.com, which is a very special event.
[03:29:36.057 --> 03:29:40.040]  Stefan Molyneux is going to be there, Gavin McInnes is going to be there, I'm going to be there.
[03:29:40.040 --> 03:29:43.643]  We're going to do a live podcasting.
[03:29:43.643 --> 03:29:51.048]  You can't even buy tickets yet because it's not even a public event yet, but if you go to a nightforfreedom.com,
[03:29:52.463 --> 03:29:54.364]  You can see we have a big event planned.
[03:29:54.364 --> 03:29:56.225]  So last night, 11 p.m.
[03:29:56.225 --> 03:30:04.249]  Pacific Time, I'm emailing, setting up the event page, organizing it, booking a venue, catering, working with great DJs.
[03:30:04.249 --> 03:30:09.012]  I wake up, I work more, do journalism, get up, do a Reddit AMA.
[03:30:09.012 --> 03:30:11.173]  Now I'm the biggest story in the world right now.
[03:30:11.173 --> 03:30:12.814]  Get right in here to InfoWars.
[03:30:12.814 --> 03:30:17.877]  And that's, by the way, a lot of you, you know, because if you listen and you watch it, because that used to be me.
[03:30:18.877 --> 03:30:22.941]  When I went into InfoWars, that's why I always hype the products.
[03:30:22.941 --> 03:30:24.642]  I always hype the products.
[03:30:24.642 --> 03:30:31.148]  Not only because they're good, but because when you see the production team behind the scenes, I just come in and show up.
[03:30:31.148 --> 03:30:33.010]  They have articles ready, videos ready.
[03:30:33.010 --> 03:30:35.992]  I just show up and they're like, what do you want to talk about?
[03:30:35.992 --> 03:30:37.934]  I don't even know what I'm going to talk about.
[03:30:37.934 --> 03:30:44.780]  You know, probably drives them crazy because I very rarely send them notes or anything, but they're so fast and so responsive and so productive.
[03:30:45.327 --> 03:30:55.557]  They were even telling me to fix my hair, which I tried to, but I used a little bit of coconut oil for my hair earlier, so I think the coconut oil sort of, you know, coconut oil is great for your hair, by the way.
[03:30:55.557 --> 03:31:01.403]  But that's the idea, is when you take the products and the bone broth and you take good care of yourself, you have energy.
[03:31:01.403 --> 03:31:05.788]  In fact, I have so much energy, people accuse me all the time of drugs, which is a joke.
[03:31:05.788 --> 03:31:07.650]  I haven't even had wine in three or four weeks.
[03:31:08.197 --> 03:31:09.978]  So Shauna always gets a kick out of it.
[03:31:09.978 --> 03:31:17.424]  No, this is when you feel passion and commitment and know that you're on the side of truth and you know that you're fighting against the globalists.
[03:31:17.424 --> 03:31:20.886]  You have all this energy, but you have to take care of your body too.
[03:31:20.886 --> 03:31:28.211]  And of course, speaking of the enemy, Jink, Alex Jones's good friend, Jink.
[03:31:28.211 --> 03:31:29.312]  Very, very bad boy.
[03:31:29.312 --> 03:31:31.734]  Some very, very, very bad stuff going on.
[03:31:32.671 --> 03:31:39.437]  Some of you may remember, you know, Jink is promoted by YouTube and Alex Jones is censored by YouTube.
[03:31:39.437 --> 03:31:42.659]  So we can now say that here is what YouTube endorses.
[03:31:42.659 --> 03:31:46.702]  By the way, YouTube does allow child abuse content on their website.
[03:31:46.702 --> 03:31:52.487]  They allow videos that aren't illegal, but they are technically pedo style videos.
[03:31:52.487 --> 03:31:54.349]  And here is what they endorse.
[03:31:54.349 --> 03:31:59.613]  This is, I can't even read the whole thing, so I don't know what I can show, but he went on a road trip
[03:32:00.225 --> 03:32:09.477]  With the friend of his and his friend said, when Jake went to get gas, I went and approach some girls that I saw walking by the train tracks.
[03:32:09.477 --> 03:32:11.620]  They were 14 to 16.
[03:32:11.620 --> 03:32:14.464]  They were the W word in training.
[03:32:14.464 --> 03:32:15.986]  So you can use your imagination.
[03:32:16.781 --> 03:32:31.813]  That his co-blogger, and they posted this on his blog, they referred to, you know, his co-blogger did, and it was on his blog, and they still work together, referred to a 14-year-old girl as WH, fill in the rest, in training.
[03:32:31.813 --> 03:32:34.735]  And he was hitting on a 14-year-old girl.
[03:32:34.735 --> 03:32:37.177]  So Jink goes, well, I've never propositioned.
[03:32:37.177 --> 03:32:43.081]  There's a great line in there, let's read it, because I'm a lawyer and I really like to parse things.
[03:32:43.081 --> 03:32:46.384]  He said, I never, or he goes, we never propositioned
[03:32:47.179 --> 03:32:48.540]  Underage girls.
[03:32:48.540 --> 03:32:51.242]  We never propositioned underage girls.
[03:32:51.242 --> 03:32:54.724]  And I thought, man, that is a weird way of putting it.
[03:32:54.724 --> 03:32:56.605]  You've never propositioned.
[03:32:56.605 --> 03:32:59.467]  Does that mean they propositioned you?
[03:32:59.467 --> 03:32:59.727]  Right?
[03:32:59.727 --> 03:33:01.348]  What if they had propositioned you?
[03:33:01.348 --> 03:33:01.868]  Right?
[03:33:01.868 --> 03:33:07.372]  The whole thing, the whole idea that, well, I never prop, that is like such a Clinton-esque.
[03:33:07.372 --> 03:33:10.173]  It's such a Clinton-esque answer to this.
[03:33:10.173 --> 03:33:12.775]  Well, we never propositioned any underage girls.
[03:33:13.658 --> 03:33:14.618]  Wow.
[03:33:14.618 --> 03:33:18.199]  I can say not only have I never propositioned, but I've never been propositioned.
[03:33:18.199 --> 03:33:22.600]  And if I had been propositioned, I would say, please go home and talk to your family.
[03:33:22.600 --> 03:33:26.401]  OK, please go to your church or your mosque or synagogue.
[03:33:26.401 --> 03:33:29.142]  Please, please don't be walking around the train tracks.
[03:33:29.142 --> 03:33:30.402]  But this is what they do.
[03:33:30.402 --> 03:33:35.924]  You know, they go on road trips and wayward souls, you know, young girls confused about life.
[03:33:35.924 --> 03:33:41.185]  Maybe they don't have, you know, maybe they're from a broken home, which, by the way, does remind me of Rotherham.
[03:33:42.060 --> 03:33:43.781]  That is classic.
[03:33:43.781 --> 03:33:46.443]  I'm not saying Jink or his friend were grooming them.
[03:33:46.443 --> 03:33:55.468]  So I'll be careful with what I'm saying here because I do believe in only holding people accountable for what they said and not fabricating things unlike the fake news media.
[03:33:56.508 --> 03:34:08.572]  But what they would do in Rotherham, these rape gangs, what they would do is they would go find kind of like wayward souls, young girls, 14, 15, and they would be like, maybe stand by the train tracks.
[03:34:08.572 --> 03:34:09.872]  Oh, where are your parents at?
[03:34:09.872 --> 03:34:14.634]  Oh, your parents don't give you enough attention, or maybe your parents are bad, or maybe you're poor.
[03:34:14.634 --> 03:34:16.894]  Well, how about, you know, you ride in a car with me or something?
[03:34:16.894 --> 03:34:18.555]  This is what they do in Rotherham.
[03:34:19.301 --> 03:34:24.123]  So I'm not saying Jink and his friend, I don't know what his friend's name Dave or whatever are doing that.
[03:34:24.123 --> 03:34:30.645]  But when I read that, I want to know why was an adult man who saw girls walking by train tracks?
[03:34:30.645 --> 03:34:31.005]  Why?
[03:34:31.005 --> 03:34:32.586]  Why did he go over there and talk to him?
[03:34:32.586 --> 03:34:35.267]  What was his really what was his agenda?
[03:34:35.267 --> 03:34:36.747]  And doing that, right?
[03:34:36.747 --> 03:34:37.688]  Me, I'm the opposite.
[03:34:37.688 --> 03:34:39.668]  I'm like, you kids need to stay over there.
[03:34:39.668 --> 03:34:42.669]  You know, your kids you keep your distance.
[03:34:42.669 --> 03:34:44.470]  And I wonder why would he do that?
[03:34:45.330 --> 03:34:55.435]  And then what kind of person would refer to Wayward Souls, Lost Girls as being WH fill in the blank in training?
[03:34:55.435 --> 03:34:58.657]  Well, that's the kind of person endorsed by YouTube.
[03:34:58.657 --> 03:35:05.101]  So my question for YouTube and Google is why do you censor Alex Jones?
[03:35:05.101 --> 03:35:07.422]  Why do you censor Mike Cernovich?
[03:35:07.422 --> 03:35:11.424]  They censored my documentary on rape in Sweden.
[03:35:12.142 --> 03:35:13.482]  Why do you censor Mike Cernovich?
[03:35:13.482 --> 03:35:23.684]  Why do you censor Alex Jones while endorsing people who are approaching underage girls and referring to them in very, very nasty, nasty tones, right?
[03:35:23.684 --> 03:35:28.826]  But that is the leftist media, and that's why people go, it's a conspiracy theory.
[03:35:28.826 --> 03:35:40.648]  It is not a conspiracy theory to say that people on the left, they want to tear homes down, they want broken homes, because this makes children vulnerable.
[03:35:41.408 --> 03:35:50.452]  And that story that I read, I'm being very careful here, just because I know Soros is trying to really get us framed for something.
[03:35:50.452 --> 03:35:59.776]  But when I read that, I want to know why an adult man is going up to a 14-year-old girl who's a lost soul, and then referring to her as a you-know-what in training.
[03:35:59.776 --> 03:36:01.116]  That isn't okay.
[03:36:01.116 --> 03:36:04.438]  I don't know why YouTube and the liberal media, well, I do know why they endorse it.
[03:36:04.438 --> 03:36:07.539]  I do know why they endorse it, and we'll talk about that more in the next segment.
[03:36:15.049 --> 03:36:15.790]  I'm so excited.
[03:36:15.790 --> 03:36:25.998]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real Red Pill.
[03:36:25.998 --> 03:36:31.502]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[03:36:31.502 --> 03:36:34.505]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:36:34.505 --> 03:36:43.312]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:36:45.385 --> 03:37:04.969]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:37:04.969 --> 03:37:07.649]  It is amazing!
[03:37:07.649 --> 03:37:12.610]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[03:37:14.625 --> 03:37:22.908]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high-quality products and fund the InfoWar.

[03:38:04.751 --> 03:38:05.751]  10% off on Auto Ship.

[03:38:18.676 --> 03:38:23.338]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[03:38:23.338 --> 03:38:24.859]  Op-op-op-op-optimum levels.
[03:38:25.931 --> 03:38:30.995]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[03:38:30.995 --> 03:38:34.678]  O-O-O-O-Optimum levels, B vitamins we need every day.

[03:38:47.929 --> 03:38:50.912]  Secret 12, optimal absorption.
[03:38:50.912 --> 03:38:56.077]  B vitamins help the body convert food into energy by supporting your intercellular processes.
[03:38:56.077 --> 03:39:01.182]  B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system.
[03:39:01.182 --> 03:39:01.983]  Optimum levels.
[03:39:03.404 --> 03:39:07.566]  Secret 12 is an easy way to increase your vitamin B12 intake.

[03:40:39.479 --> 03:40:45.304]  And now, your host, Mike Cernovich.
[03:40:45.304 --> 03:40:47.105]  Alright, we're back with the final segment.
[03:40:47.105 --> 03:40:52.169]  Mike Cernovich and I still have a hair strand kind of sticking out.
[03:40:52.169 --> 03:40:53.570]  So, it is what it is.
[03:40:53.570 --> 03:40:55.152]  I'll get a haircut, people.
[03:40:55.152 --> 03:40:57.573]  I promise.
[03:40:57.573 --> 03:40:59.615]  I blame Shawna, my lovely wife.
[03:40:59.615 --> 03:41:00.576]  You know, she's supposed to
[03:41:01.425 --> 03:41:05.026]  Make sure that, you know, maybe I'll teach her to cut my hair and she'll just clip it up.
[03:41:05.026 --> 03:41:06.566]  But anyway, we're back.
[03:41:06.566 --> 03:41:07.886]  Final segment.
[03:41:07.886 --> 03:41:15.367]  So much going on in the world, and it's very depressing that the fake news media is obsessed with my Reddit AMA, right?
[03:41:15.367 --> 03:41:17.108]  Like, get a life, people.
[03:41:17.108 --> 03:41:20.408]  As much as I pretend to have a big ego, I really don't.
[03:41:20.408 --> 03:41:29.670]  The only reason I got into this was to save America and fight the globalists and to speak for all of the people who are attacked by the evildoers in America.
[03:41:29.670 --> 03:41:29.730]  And
[03:41:32.330 --> 03:41:33.191]  I think it's dumb.
[03:41:33.191 --> 03:41:43.960]  I think it's dumb that there are now like a hundred journalists tweet, over a hundred, it's like thousands, tweeting about me and some Reddit AMA that I did for two hours, goofing off and just having a good time.
[03:41:43.960 --> 03:41:47.343]  You know, why don't they break stories like John Conyers?
[03:41:47.343 --> 03:41:49.845]  Why don't they go after the Bill Clinton, the rapist?
[03:41:49.845 --> 03:41:52.607]  Why don't they go after the sexual harassment settlements?
[03:41:52.607 --> 03:41:53.948]  Why are they so obsessed with me?
[03:41:53.948 --> 03:41:55.830]  Well, that's because they fear me.
[03:41:55.830 --> 03:41:56.851]  They fear InfoWars.
[03:41:56.851 --> 03:41:58.112]  They fear Alex.
[03:41:58.112 --> 03:41:59.893]  That's because they fear you.
[03:42:01.385 --> 03:42:04.207]  Because you're the ones who fund the operation.
[03:42:04.207 --> 03:42:10.831]  You are the ones who keep the operation going strong, and you need to keep your body going strong.
[03:42:10.831 --> 03:42:14.474]  And that's what's great about Alpha Power, which is on special.
[03:42:14.474 --> 03:42:18.957]  Again, a bunch of specials going in for the holidays.
[03:42:18.957 --> 03:42:22.419]  And Alpha Power, very, very impressive stuff.
[03:42:22.419 --> 03:42:26.142]  It has essential nutrients that people need.
[03:42:26.142 --> 03:42:29.044]  It has what people need, especially men.
[03:42:30.259 --> 03:42:35.582]  To promote vitality, strength, focus.
[03:42:35.582 --> 03:42:38.303]  You know, I hear it all the time from people, especially women.
[03:42:38.303 --> 03:42:44.606]  That's what I think is funny is, you know, all these soy boys and male feminists will dig up all my writing.
[03:42:44.606 --> 03:42:45.186]  Oh, my God.
[03:42:45.186 --> 03:42:46.447]  And they lie about it, of course, too.
[03:42:46.447 --> 03:42:47.427]  They're not even honest.
[03:42:47.427 --> 03:42:53.130]  But when they share that with women, most women are thinking, well, I mean, yeah, I wish I wish men were men.
[03:42:54.326 --> 03:42:57.710]  So the soy boys are the ones, well, everybody needs this.
[03:42:57.710 --> 03:43:00.873]  Me, the whole world, because the world is so poisonous.
[03:43:00.873 --> 03:43:02.494]  The men need it.
[03:43:02.494 --> 03:43:09.321]  But especially the haters and the male feminists and all the people on Reddit, this is the kind of product that they need and your support is so vital.
[03:43:09.321 --> 03:43:14.066]  And the attacks on me are just an attack on you.
[03:43:14.066 --> 03:43:14.847]  And let's compare.
[03:43:14.847 --> 03:43:16.549]  Let's compare
[03:43:18.030 --> 03:43:29.676]  Me, Alex, Infowars, Paul Joseph Watson, who by the way, I mean, you want to talk about crystal, crystal clear, you know, I've done some satire that maybe I shouldn't have done and that gets twisted.
[03:43:29.676 --> 03:43:35.939]  But let's talk about Paul Joseph Watson, who's attacked by the media versus Jink.
[03:43:35.939 --> 03:43:41.262]  I still want to know, why are Paul Joseph Watson's videos censored?
[03:43:42.324 --> 03:43:58.981]  But Jink and his friend Dave, who like to drive through small towns and walk around train tracks, you know, doing God knows what, and the way, you know, young girls, not even women, we're talking 14 year olds, are being referred to, shouldn't they be censored?
[03:43:58.981 --> 03:43:59.121]  Right?
[03:43:59.121 --> 03:44:02.104]  I mean, if you want to, if YouTube is going to censor somebody,
[03:44:03.664 --> 03:44:07.706]  Why would they censor Paul Joseph Watson and not censor Jink?
[03:44:07.706 --> 03:44:15.731]  So the article, of course, is Young Turks founder Jink apologized Thursday after demeaning comments aimed at women were discovered on an old blog.
[03:44:15.731 --> 03:44:19.312]  Why isn't the media demanding that?
[03:44:19.312 --> 03:44:24.815]  I mean, I'll tell you right now, my Reddit AMA is a bigger story than Jink.
[03:44:24.815 --> 03:44:25.616]  So go ahead
[03:44:26.926 --> 03:44:29.529]  Go ahead and tell me why that is.
[03:44:29.529 --> 03:44:39.999]  Why is it that YouTube's Golden Boy, they promote his stuff, and even though they promote it, Alex Jones' stuff is way more successful, and Paul Joseph Watson's, they had to censor my channel actually.
[03:44:39.999 --> 03:44:44.123]  My channel was growing by a thousand subscribers a day.
[03:44:44.835 --> 03:44:47.156]  And then overnight, I lost a bunch.
[03:44:47.156 --> 03:44:49.597]  And then ever since then, it's like 10 or 15 a day.
[03:44:49.597 --> 03:44:55.319]  My YouTube videos, even though I have 65,000 subscribers, only do 500 to 1,000 views.
[03:44:55.319 --> 03:45:04.302]  So YouTube, they realized that they had to censor me and attack me because the message is what the people want to hear.
[03:45:04.302 --> 03:45:07.823]  The message is truth, prosperity, the tax cut.
[03:45:08.522 --> 03:45:10.604]  They had to censor Paul Joseph Watson's.
[03:45:10.604 --> 03:45:12.946]  They had to censor Infowars.
[03:45:12.946 --> 03:45:16.309]  For us, we're always fighting just for equal rights.
[03:45:16.309 --> 03:45:20.112]  Which, by the way, in my AMA, somebody goes, why did you oppose net neutrality?
[03:45:20.112 --> 03:45:25.697]  Well, because the same tech companies that want to censor us are the ones who
[03:45:26.934 --> 03:45:29.414]  Said we need net neutrality for free and open internet.
[03:45:29.414 --> 03:45:31.095]  I don't see a free and open internet.
[03:45:31.095 --> 03:45:33.095]  The internet doesn't see free and open to me.
[03:45:33.095 --> 03:45:35.076]  I see my videos getting censored.
[03:45:35.076 --> 03:45:40.777]  I see my award-winning documentary on rape in Sweden being banned in Europe.
[03:45:40.777 --> 03:45:41.417]  Think about this.
[03:45:41.417 --> 03:45:43.037]  This is not a joke.
[03:45:43.037 --> 03:45:49.058]  My documentary on Sweden, which contained no nudity, no foul language, and I never even mentioned Muslims.
[03:45:49.058 --> 03:45:50.478]  It wasn't even a Muslim hit piece.
[03:45:50.478 --> 03:45:53.699]  It was just about Sweden and how they're having a rape problem.
[03:45:54.460 --> 03:45:59.642]  was age-restricted, and then they banned it in all of Europe.
[03:45:59.642 --> 03:46:02.083]  It was banned in the Czech Republic, Germany.
[03:46:02.083 --> 03:46:05.924]  So a documentary, this is like Hitler.
[03:46:05.924 --> 03:46:15.588]  This is why you got, as you can see in this picture, if you're reading this on Breitbart, you know, you can see I'm at the White House, you know, doing journalism, reporting everywhere, breaking these big stories.
[03:46:15.588 --> 03:46:18.989]  So they can't deny that I'm a legitimate journalist and documentary filmmaker.
[03:46:19.884 --> 03:46:25.707]  So why then is it that they banned my documentary on rape?
[03:46:25.707 --> 03:46:27.648]  I thought they were the feminists.
[03:46:27.648 --> 03:46:37.892]  If a man or a woman is trying to help Swedish women and trying to help fight against rape culture, you would think the left would be thrilled.
[03:46:37.892 --> 03:46:39.613]  They would go, Oh my God, this is amazing.
[03:46:39.613 --> 03:46:45.076]  They're, they're trying to, you know, join with us on issues and we should try to fight rape.
[03:46:45.076 --> 03:46:45.756]  This is amazing.
[03:46:46.630 --> 03:46:48.551]  Instead, they ban it in Europe.
[03:46:48.551 --> 03:46:49.191]  That's what they have.
[03:46:49.191 --> 03:46:51.032]  They age restrict it in the US.
[03:46:51.032 --> 03:46:54.813]  So, by the way, age restriction isn't just an R rating.
[03:46:54.813 --> 03:47:00.416]  If a video on YouTube is age restricted, your video will not show up on YouTube search.
[03:47:00.416 --> 03:47:06.718]  If a person's not logged into his or her account, they can't even watch the video because they have to confirm they're above a certain age.
[03:47:06.718 --> 03:47:08.299]  You can't make any likes.
[03:47:08.299 --> 03:47:10.260]  You can't post any comments.
[03:47:10.260 --> 03:47:11.040]  You can't share it.
[03:47:11.835 --> 03:47:12.095]  Right?
[03:47:12.095 --> 03:47:14.678]  So that's age restriction.
[03:47:14.678 --> 03:47:17.540]  This is why it's such an Orwellian descriptor.
[03:47:17.540 --> 03:47:19.342]  Oh, we just age restricted it.
[03:47:19.342 --> 03:47:21.143]  Most people go, oh, age restriction.
[03:47:21.143 --> 03:47:23.625]  It just means you don't want 13 year olds on there.
[03:47:23.625 --> 03:47:28.129]  No, YouTube doesn't age restrict its pedophile videos.
[03:47:28.129 --> 03:47:34.495]  Charlie Rizal, who, you know, has been very hard, BuzzFeed, which has been very hard and in many cases, very unfair.
[03:47:35.288 --> 03:47:43.635]  At least they did something right, and they did report on how YouTube allows child abuse and child exploitation videos on its platform.
[03:47:43.635 --> 03:47:49.099]  So age restriction doesn't mean that if you're under 13 you can't watch it.
[03:47:49.099 --> 03:48:04.791]  Because they'll allow children to watch abuse videos, borderline snuff films on YouTube, kids being kidnapped, taped up, thrown into garbage dumpsters, syringes being operated on, really sick stuff by the way.
[03:48:05.656 --> 03:48:07.518]  And YouTube allows that.
[03:48:07.518 --> 03:48:09.420]  They don't age restrict that.
[03:48:09.420 --> 03:48:22.252]  But if you do a documentary on politics, or rape in Sweden, or Paul Joseph Watson, his video on modern art, they tried to censor that.
[03:48:22.252 --> 03:48:24.634]  Just a critique of modern art.
[03:48:24.634 --> 03:48:25.355]  Come on, right?
[03:48:25.355 --> 03:48:27.577]  What's your justification for that?
[03:48:27.577 --> 03:48:28.998]  They will censor you.
[03:48:29.818 --> 03:48:33.179]  So, age restriction doesn't mean, oh, you can only watch it if you're over 13.
[03:48:33.179 --> 03:48:48.544]  No, age restriction means you can't share the link, you can't watch it unless you're signed in, and you can't comment on it, you can't like it, you can't search for it, you can't tell your friends, oh my god, I watched this amazing documentary on YouTube called Invasion by Mike Cernovich.
[03:48:48.544 --> 03:48:52.926]  Yeah, censored by YouTube, the truth about modern art.
[03:48:52.926 --> 03:48:54.346]  How do you censor?
[03:48:54.346 --> 03:48:56.347]  It's just a critique on modern art.
[03:48:57.037 --> 03:49:03.741]  There's no, so with the YouTube people, YouTube does allow jink and they do allow, you know, child abuse videos.
[03:49:03.741 --> 03:49:13.946]  So YouTube, they might go, well, the reason we banned Sernovich's video in all of Europe and the reason we age restricted it and censored it is because he's critical of migrants and that xenophobia.
[03:49:13.946 --> 03:49:18.688]  I think that's BS because they allow hatred of Swedes and they allow hatred of white people.
[03:49:18.688 --> 03:49:20.569]  So clearly that's got nothing to do with it.
[03:49:20.569 --> 03:49:21.830]  I can at least say, well, okay.
[03:49:22.310 --> 03:49:24.051]  I think you're snowballing me.
[03:49:24.051 --> 03:49:27.673]  I think you're a fraud, but okay, that's plausible enough.
[03:49:27.673 --> 03:49:28.673]  It isn't true.
[03:49:28.673 --> 03:49:33.396]  It's one of those things where it's a lie, but it's a plausible lie.
[03:49:33.396 --> 03:49:42.821]  With PJW, with Paul the Great, with Paul the Great's modern art video, what was he criticizing?
[03:49:42.821 --> 03:49:45.822]  He wasn't criticizing any race, religion.
[03:49:45.822 --> 03:49:49.504]  He was just, but his video was so powerful and so poignant
[03:49:50.194 --> 03:49:51.835]  That the censors had to shut it down.
[03:49:51.835 --> 03:50:00.318]  We have cultural censors, just like they have in Communist China, just like they have in the Soviet Union, just like every left-wing culture.
[03:50:00.318 --> 03:50:03.779]  Castro, Che, who they celebrate as a hero.
[03:50:03.779 --> 03:50:15.283]  They have, they have cultural critics and cultural censors, and that is now what YouTube has become, a cultural censorship item.
[03:50:15.283 --> 03:50:18.284]  And they saw that the Paul the Great's video was so compelling,
[03:50:19.352 --> 03:50:20.193]  They had to censor it.
[03:50:20.193 --> 03:50:21.113]  They had to shut it down.
[03:50:21.113 --> 03:50:26.177]  They said, no Paul, you can't get past the censors.
[03:50:26.177 --> 03:50:29.800]  But when you share the link, you break the algorithm.
[03:50:29.800 --> 03:50:35.444]  The only way to break the conditioning, the only way to break the algorithm, share this link.
[03:50:35.444 --> 03:50:36.685]  Share this video.
[03:50:36.685 --> 03:50:37.945]  Clip this video.
[03:50:37.945 --> 03:50:41.948]  Even if you're a hater and a loser and you want to edit me out of context, thank you.
[03:50:41.948 --> 03:50:43.550]  Thank you for all those edited videos.
[03:50:43.550 --> 03:50:45.231]  Thank you for all those lies.
[03:50:45.231 --> 03:50:48.073]  Thank you for those of you who love us and share the videos widely.
[03:50:48.654 --> 03:50:50.077]  And promote everybody!
[03:50:50.077 --> 03:50:51.100]  Thank you for watching.
