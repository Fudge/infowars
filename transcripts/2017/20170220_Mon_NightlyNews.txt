[00:00:28.975 --> 00:00:39.861]  Tonight, America has a new National Security Advisor, and the establishment left has a new character to assassinate.
[00:00:40.221 --> 00:00:48.286]  Meanwhile, Vice President Pence joins the dark side in his unwavering commitment to support NATO.
[00:00:50.455 --> 00:01:02.022]  Then, less than a week after the Day Without Immigrants walkout demonstration, progressives have now launched an I Am a Muslim Too rally in Times Square.
[00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:10.767]  And lo and behold, Chelsea Clinton joined the protest with her two-year-old daughter in solidarity for Muslim immigrants.

[00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.493]  If you can hear my voice, you are the resistance.
[00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:09.111]  Today, Donald Trump announced his replacement for General Flynn.
[00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:10.131]  It's H.R.
[00:03:10.272 --> 00:03:10.892]  McMaster.
[00:03:11.112 --> 00:03:13.253]  As the LA Times points out, he's an Army strategist.
[00:03:13.914 --> 00:03:16.475]  He's the new National Security Advisor.
[00:03:17.135 --> 00:03:25.120]  And of course, this is a replacement for Flynn, who last week we saw was taken out in a political assassination by the CIA, the Washington Post, and perhaps
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.600]  Vice President Pence.
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.761]  We'll talk more about that later.
[00:03:27.881 --> 00:03:41.904]  McMaster has served since July 2014 as director of the Army Capabilities Integration Center, but he's perhaps best known as the author of a 1997 book, Dereliction of Duty, that explores the military's responsibility for the U.S.
[00:03:41.964 --> 00:03:43.865]  failure during the Vietnam War.
[00:03:44.565 --> 00:03:47.746]  As we look at this and the descriptions of this, I think it may
[00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.212]  Give us an interesting insight into the man and what his role in the Trump administration may be.
[00:03:53.952 --> 00:04:03.576]  Of course, a subtitle to this book, Dereliction of Duty, is Lyndon Johnson, Robert McNamara, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the lies that led to Vietnam.
[00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:06.738]  And of course, we know from the documentary, The Fog of War, we saw
[00:04:07.698 --> 00:04:12.842]  Robert McNamara before he died admitting that the Gulf of Tonkin was a false flag.
[00:04:12.922 --> 00:04:16.504]  That in fact there had been no attack, but that was only the beginning of the lies.
[00:04:16.544 --> 00:04:20.867]  McMaster went on to look at what was going on within the administration.
[00:04:21.327 --> 00:04:22.648]  Went through all the different memos.
[00:04:22.668 --> 00:04:24.249]  There's a very detailed book.
[00:04:24.329 --> 00:04:28.972]  It was part of his master's thesis that he got at University of North Carolina.
[00:04:29.253 --> 00:04:36.838]  They say it's considered to be the seminal work on the military's responsibility during Vietnam to confront their civilian bosses when strategy was not working.
[00:04:37.618 --> 00:04:44.646]  It says that his thesis proposes the plans and the advice on Vietnam prepared by the nation's military advisors were systematically sidetracked by McNamara.
[00:04:44.666 --> 00:04:45.588]  Well, we all know that.
[00:04:45.708 --> 00:04:53.096]  But then he goes on to say, as damning as the civilian leaders as he is, McMaster's doesn't blithely exonerate the brass.
[00:04:53.116 --> 00:04:56.080]  And of course, I'm reading from a review here that was put up by
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.361]  Amazon.com from the publishers.
[00:04:58.662 --> 00:05:00.123]  They didn't heed their own warnings.
[00:05:00.163 --> 00:05:08.308]  They acquiesced in McNamara's incrementalist policy in the hope of eventually getting the huge force they definitely advised would be needed to win.
[00:05:08.448 --> 00:05:26.060]  So he hits Johnson, he hits McNamara on the political side of this, but he also hits the generals for not standing up and having a unified strategy, but not speaking out about the obvious failures that were going on here, allowing the politics to play through to the destruction of many lives, quite frankly.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.363]  But before we move on, let's not forget General Flynn so quickly.
[00:05:30.904 --> 00:05:36.869]  Because the political assassination of General Flynn will be repeated if we don't look at it more carefully.
[00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:45.136]  There's a post this weekend from National Review saying there appears to be no basis at all for a criminal or intelligence probe of General Flynn.
[00:05:45.156 --> 00:05:48.099]  They say, why was the FBI investigating him in the first place?
[00:05:48.732 --> 00:05:53.794]  They say he was dismissed amid a torrent of mainstream media reporting and disgraceful government leaks.
[00:05:54.094 --> 00:05:58.215]  And then they go on to say on what basis, however, was the FBI investigating him?
[00:05:58.815 --> 00:06:11.639]  And they say to predicate an investigation under FBI guidelines, there must be good faith suspicion that A, a federal crime has been committed or is being committed, or B, there is a threat to American national security, or C, there's an opportunity to collect
[00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:16.041]  Foreign intelligence relevant to a priority established by the executive branch.
[00:06:16.161 --> 00:06:20.142]  And they said, sometimes these overlap, but they take a look at the last category.
[00:06:20.642 --> 00:06:24.064]  They say, at first blush, this category seems to be limitless.
[00:06:24.584 --> 00:06:25.244]  Yeah, it does.
[00:06:25.304 --> 00:06:31.087]  You know, anybody that might have some information that might impinge in some way, shape, or form on national security.
[00:06:31.687 --> 00:06:36.749]  Unmooring government investigators from the constraints that normally confine their intrusions on our liberties.
[00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:39.210]  For example, snooping, search warrants, interrogations.
[00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:45.313]  To situations where there is no real reason to suspect unlawful or dangerous activity.
[00:06:45.973 --> 00:06:47.654]  You see, this is a very important point.
[00:06:48.314 --> 00:06:49.335]  He was a private citizen.
[00:06:50.075 --> 00:06:54.838]  And I hope that the lesson that is learned from this, lynching, this political assassination,
[00:06:55.871 --> 00:06:57.953]  I hope Donald Trump learns a lesson from this.
[00:06:57.973 --> 00:07:13.907]  He needs to not only be careful of the dark state that set this up, but he also needs to take a look at this kind of security state that we have winked and nodded at in the name of national security that can do this type of thing not only to General Flynn,
[00:07:14.687 --> 00:07:34.546]  But to each and every American, and to a President of the United States like Donald Trump eventually as well, if we don't stand for the rule of law, if we don't make them get search warrants, if we don't have to have a reason to investigate somebody, if they can do what we saw with Stalin, bring me the man, I'll find the crime.
[00:07:34.566 --> 00:07:35.847]  And that's precisely what happened.
[00:07:36.587 --> 00:07:42.848]  Now, as we saw over the weekend, we're going to get to what Vice President Pence said in Europe.
[00:07:43.528 --> 00:07:52.930]  But before we leave this, I think it's very important that we understand that it was the Washington Post that was at the center of these revelations about General Flynn.
[00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.231]  Of course, they were given this information.
[00:07:55.811 --> 00:07:58.811]  That was the newspaper that it was leaked to.
[00:07:59.071 --> 00:08:02.552]  Going back to December of 2013, a little over three years ago,
[00:08:03.672 --> 00:08:10.973]  Alternet talked about Jeff Bezos and his connection with the Washington Post and the CIA at the nexus of this.
[00:08:11.053 --> 00:08:17.635]  And remember that as we had the lead up to Trump becoming president, he was meeting with a lot of people.
[00:08:17.655 --> 00:08:29.257]  He had a meeting with a lot of people out of California, people who were part of Silicon Valley, and of course Jeff Bezos was there at the table, but at the far end of the table, in the corner.
[00:08:29.986 --> 00:08:36.871]  And of course Donald Trump has also said that he was going to look into antitrust violations of the Washington Post.
[00:08:37.111 --> 00:08:45.537]  Well, actually antitrust violations of Jeff Bezos, who owns the Washington Post, because the Washington Post was targeting him during the campaign.
[00:08:45.557 --> 00:08:46.898]  And so he kind of pushed back on that.
[00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:51.241]  But understand the connection between Jeff Bezos and the CIA.
[00:08:52.386 --> 00:09:03.982]  Now he bought the Washington Post, and yet, as is pointed out in Alternet over three years ago, they keep his Washington Post readers in the dark about his connection to the CIA.
[00:09:04.642 --> 00:09:05.884]  Now he bought the Washington Post for $250 million.
[00:09:07.406 --> 00:09:13.529]  But the CIA has a $600 million contract with the CIA as of three years ago.
[00:09:13.549 --> 00:09:18.152]  They point out that's more than twice as much as Bezos paid to buy the Washington Post to start with.
[00:09:18.812 --> 00:09:24.875]  And of course he said, we look forward at the time, three years ago, to a very successful relationship with the CIA.
[00:09:26.076 --> 00:09:38.183]  And they say, in alternate, as Amazon's majority owner and the Post's only owner, Bezos stands to gain a lot more if his newspaper does less ruffling and more soothing of CIA feathers.
[00:09:38.504 --> 00:09:43.847]  They say the media watch group FAIR pointed out what happened after WikiLeaks published State Department cables.
[00:09:44.187 --> 00:09:48.230]  They said WikiLeaks was booted from Amazon's web hosting service, AWS.
[00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:55.494]  So at the height of public interest in what WikiLeaks was publishing, readers were unable to access the WikiLeaks website.
[00:09:56.462 --> 00:10:00.667]  So we're going to talk about NATO here in a moment, but I got to say that the alliance
[00:10:01.616 --> 00:10:10.582]  NATO is far less pertinent to what's going on in the world right now than the CIA's alliances with the Washington Post and Jeff Bezos.
[00:10:10.862 --> 00:10:13.184]  Or the CIA's alliance with Saudi Arabia.
[00:10:13.444 --> 00:10:14.925]  That's really what we should be focused on.
[00:10:15.505 --> 00:10:19.668]  I think that Donald Trump is right when he said that NATO really is obsolete.
[00:10:19.708 --> 00:10:28.393]  But what is not obsolete is the dark, deep state that is represented by this nexus of the Washington Post and the CIA.
[00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:29.394]  Jeff Bezos.
[00:10:31.135 --> 00:10:42.406]  Vice President Pence went to Munich of all places this weekend and this is happening even as was reported today, even Norway is riding a populist wave of politics.
[00:10:42.446 --> 00:10:47.611]  We've got Marine Le Pen at a new high at 27% in a three-way race.
[00:10:47.631 --> 00:10:50.794]  The other two candidates have 20% as it's coming up as I've reported before.
[00:10:51.314 --> 00:10:59.925]  We have people in France saying we've looked at Brexit, we've looked at Trump's election, and we believe that for the first time we can really change things here in France.
[00:11:00.126 --> 00:11:08.076]  And yet, with all of that happening, we have the Vice President go to Munich and declare his undying love for the European Union.
[00:11:08.917 --> 00:11:10.277]  Strange thing indeed.
[00:11:10.937 --> 00:11:17.899]  And so, a look at what he did on Saturday when he was at Munich, and then we're going to talk about what happened today in Brussels.
[00:11:18.559 --> 00:11:28.701]  So Saturday he goes to Munich, just like Neville Chamberlain went to meet with Adolf Hitler in Munich and sold out Czechoslovakia, the Sudetenland, and shortly after that it was invaded.
[00:11:29.441 --> 00:11:36.123]  We now have Pence going to Munich and saying that, first of all, the US's commitment to NATO is unwavering.
[00:11:36.263 --> 00:11:36.503]  Remember?
[00:11:37.083 --> 00:12:02.424]  Donald Trump said I think that it is obsolete for two reasons number one the member states are not paying the 2% that they agreed to so they're not contributing to their own defense they want us to pull all the weight for them but also because the real threat to us is Islamic extremist jihadi terrorism not necessarily Russia but that is all starting to change now with the changing Trump cabinet
[00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:06.734]  Pence said Europe's defense requires your commitment as much as ours.
[00:12:06.814 --> 00:12:10.116]  First he talked about the fact that they weren't holding up their end economically.
[00:12:10.157 --> 00:12:21.545]  He said Germany, for instance, Europe's largest economy, now only spends 1.2% of its GDP on its military, not the 2% that is required by the NATO agreement.
[00:12:22.006 --> 00:12:27.050]  Okay, now, if we look at this in context, we understand that the United States is spending 36%
[00:12:29.992 --> 00:12:40.987]  Of all the military expenditures in the world we're spending far more than the next five or six countries combined in terms of military expense and yet Germany only spends 1.2 percent of its GDP.
[00:12:43.502 --> 00:12:47.425]  But he went far from saying that NATO is obsolete.
[00:12:47.605 --> 00:12:55.790]  Pence said that while some NATO members met the spending goal, many others, including some of our largest allies, still lack a credible path and we expect the allies to meet that goal.
[00:12:56.531 --> 00:13:05.457]  He went on, however, and as he was pressing them to pay up with NATO, he began to reassure them on the European Union.
[00:13:06.272 --> 00:13:10.634]  As Reuters points out, EU welcomes Pence's assurance of Trump's support.
[00:13:11.034 --> 00:13:12.094]  Now this happened today.
[00:13:12.134 --> 00:13:19.597]  He went to Brussels and as The Guardian put it, Pence's speech could have been given and written by Joe Biden.
[00:13:20.138 --> 00:13:21.218]  That's how bad it was.
[00:13:21.258 --> 00:13:25.500]  That's how counterproductive it is to what Donald Trump has been saying.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:33.423]  And so the people in the EU, as well as I think many of us in America who voted for President Trump, want to know really who's in charge here.
[00:13:34.304 --> 00:13:36.465]  Is this some kind of a new coup that's being set up?
[00:13:36.625 --> 00:13:42.887]  Is Pence setting himself up to be the guy that's left in charge after Donald Trump is taken out?
[00:13:42.967 --> 00:13:44.868]  Is he going to be George H.W.
[00:13:44.888 --> 00:13:46.209]  Bush to Ronald Reagan?
[00:13:47.242 --> 00:14:08.725]  I say, this is Reuters, a month after Donald Trump caused alarm by renewing his endorsement of Brexit and suggesting that others may follow Britain out of the EU, Pence went with his hat in his hand to Brussels, saying that he had come to the home of the European Union with a message from the President of strong commitment to continue cooperation and partnership with the European Union.
[00:14:09.574 --> 00:14:18.983]  And immediately, Donald Tusk, who chairs the European Council of EU Leaders, told reporters that Pence had given him affirmative actions to three questions on Trump's support.
[00:14:19.924 --> 00:14:27.831]  He supports the current system of international law, that he supports NATO, and that he supports, quote, the idea of a united Europe.
[00:14:28.152 --> 00:14:34.277]  EU officials said that they were encouraged by what they called Pence's clear assurances, including
[00:14:35.018 --> 00:14:35.438]  On U.S.
[00:14:35.498 --> 00:14:38.701]  backing for holding the European Union together after Brexit.
[00:14:38.741 --> 00:14:41.723]  See, it's not a misreading to say this.
[00:14:41.783 --> 00:14:46.707]  Everybody is saying, hey look, he's saying that he wants to keep the European Union together.
[00:14:46.747 --> 00:14:48.208]  He doesn't want to see anybody else leave.
[00:14:48.228 --> 00:14:49.629]  That is not what we've heard from Trump.
[00:14:49.929 --> 00:14:54.653]  That is not what we need to see happen in terms of fighting globalism.
[00:14:55.253 --> 00:14:59.336]  And they said they'll watch closely to see how far Trump's actions match his deputy's words.
[00:14:59.976 --> 00:15:03.019]  One official said, we got everything we were looking for.
[00:15:04.161 --> 00:15:09.903]  I don't think American voters are getting what they were looking for with this kind of speech from Vice President Trump.
[00:15:10.323 --> 00:15:23.167]  And immediately, he was bitch-slapped by Tusk, the European official that he met with privately, who came out and railed against, quote, the brute force, egoism, and arrogance.
[00:15:23.407 --> 00:15:32.910]  And they said, and this was characterized by the Express in UK, as a series of jaw-dropping remarks which will be interpreted as a very thinly-veiled assault
[00:15:33.661 --> 00:15:36.642]  On the Republican Commander-in-Chief, in other words, President Trump.
[00:15:37.743 --> 00:15:40.684]  This is what you get when you try to rebuild bridges.
[00:15:41.384 --> 00:15:46.366]  This is what you get when you try to appease people like these globalists.
[00:15:47.226 --> 00:15:51.268]  And I think we need to understand and we need to stand by people like Ted Malik.
[00:15:51.308 --> 00:15:54.409]  Now Ted Malik has not been named the EU ambassador.
[00:15:55.285 --> 00:16:00.248]  But he said that he would not be cowed down and he said that President Trump would not be cowed down.
[00:16:00.608 --> 00:16:11.575]  He said that he had presided over the dissolution of the Soviet Union and he thought that maybe there was another union that needed to be resolved at the time and of course he was talking about the European Union.
[00:16:12.216 --> 00:16:16.459]  Now he goes on to Breitbart and talks about how the Financial Times
[00:16:17.179 --> 00:16:20.521]  And the UK is attempting a political assassination against him.
[00:16:20.541 --> 00:16:30.128]  Of course, there have been those in the European Union who said that they wanted to hold a vote and tell Donald Trump that he could not have Ted Malik as his EU ambassador.
[00:16:31.328 --> 00:16:37.012]  And Ted Malik said, well, maybe you didn't realize that you don't have a say in this, that we had an election in America.
[00:16:37.032 --> 00:16:39.414]  See, that's the essence of American sovereignty.
[00:16:40.054 --> 00:16:47.236]  We get to pick our ambassadors, and at the time many people said, look, we had ambassadors that we sent to Russia who did not agree with communism.
[00:16:48.096 --> 00:16:52.158]  We've had ambassadors that we sent to other areas that did not endorse Islam, okay?
[00:16:52.198 --> 00:16:59.340]  So it is not necessary for your ambassador to buy into whatever political or religious system is dominant in that country.
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.961]  And so we don't have to have an EU ambassador who buys into globalism.
[00:17:03.001 --> 00:17:03.501]  The question is,
[00:17:04.181 --> 00:17:07.284]  Do we have a vice president who buys into globalism?
[00:17:07.344 --> 00:17:10.207]  Now, this was an exclusive at Breitbart.
[00:17:10.247 --> 00:17:11.648]  This was written by Ted Malik.
[00:17:12.029 --> 00:17:18.095]  And he said, I seem to have made myself very unpopular with the European Union and its media friends, or are they their cronies?
[00:17:18.155 --> 00:17:24.802]  Indeed, there seems to be a concerted attack to get me, spearheaded by the EU's house journal, the Financial Times.
[00:17:25.362 --> 00:17:29.023]  He says, the EU does not want anyone but a pro-EU U.S.
[00:17:29.083 --> 00:17:30.324]  ambassador to go to Brussels.
[00:17:30.984 --> 00:17:34.405]  This undemocratic institution wants to force the U.S.
[00:17:34.445 --> 00:17:41.408]  to keep things the way they were and deny President Trump his selection and to stop his views from being articulated there.
[00:17:41.908 --> 00:17:49.511]  And then he goes down and he looks at all of the petty personal attack type of questions, type of gotcha questions that he was asked in the
[00:17:50.991 --> 00:17:51.292]  I don't know.
[00:18:07.714 --> 00:18:08.214]  We're good to go.
[00:18:27.486 --> 00:18:29.708]  They're going to turn around and stab us.
[00:18:29.808 --> 00:18:37.436]  The concern that I have, as we look at this, is the fact that Vice President Pence was at the center of this move against Mike Flynn.
[00:18:37.516 --> 00:18:42.221]  And that's something, along with this different approach to the EU, that concerns me very much.
[00:18:42.261 --> 00:18:42.622]  Stay with us.
[00:18:42.642 --> 00:18:47.527]  When we come back, we're going to take a look at border issues and real dollars and cents.
[00:19:01.397 --> 00:19:05.802]  This has been adopted as of 2017 by the Department of Defense.
[00:19:06.383 --> 00:19:07.805]  All four branches of the military.
[00:19:08.506 --> 00:19:09.347]  Combat One.
[00:19:10.408 --> 00:19:20.540]  And guess who in the spring of 2017 has the exclusive right to sell this to everybody else but the military?
[00:19:21.454 --> 00:19:22.994]  Infowars.com.
[00:19:23.614 --> 00:19:27.195]  I want to commend Q and Patrick and the rest of our team.
[00:19:27.235 --> 00:19:30.496]  I want to commend Combat One for getting the big Pentagon deal.
[00:19:31.096 --> 00:19:33.857]  And I want to thank them for supporting us because they know we support America.
[00:19:34.177 --> 00:19:47.719]  We are the exclusive source of Combat One Skin and Muscle Optimization Field Foam, Field Spray Skin and Muscle Optimization, and Broad Spectrum Hygiene Tactical Bath.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.980]  Contains eight pre-moistened cloths.
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:56.324]  Ladies and gentlemen, these are incredibly affordable and they have patented proprietary systems.
[00:19:56.925 --> 00:20:01.988]  That's why it's been adopted by the Pentagon, by the Defense Department, system-wide.
[00:20:02.048 --> 00:20:08.954]  I'm going to go over some of the numbers, some of the proven statistics and the claims that Combat One can make right now.
[00:20:09.754 --> 00:20:18.803]  Never before has the public been able to access this new Combat One military-grade hygiene technology used by special operations to maintain hygiene during survival situations.
[00:20:19.183 --> 00:20:21.265]  Studied for safety and effectiveness by St.
[00:20:21.325 --> 00:20:23.387]  John's Medical Research Institute, St.
[00:20:23.447 --> 00:20:31.195]  Jude's, and the American Journal of Infection Control, the technology behind Combat One wipes kills bad bacteria while leaving beneficial
[00:20:31.915 --> 00:20:33.396]  Skin bacteria unharmed.
[00:20:33.496 --> 00:20:34.557]  That's the key buffer.
[00:20:34.777 --> 00:20:39.500]  The toxic wipes, the sanitizers kill everything, including your immune system.
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:40.460]  They lower your fertility.
[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:41.021]  It's all admitted.
[00:20:41.601 --> 00:20:44.883]  Combat One is able to do this naturally by only targeting the bad stuff.
[00:20:45.363 --> 00:20:46.264]  And again, it's all patented.
[00:20:46.304 --> 00:20:47.064]  It's super secret.
[00:20:47.424 --> 00:20:49.326]  Twelve years, Special Forces testing it.
[00:20:49.966 --> 00:20:55.352]  This is something every M4 Warrior needs to order, needs to have in their home, needs to use in their daily lives.
[00:20:55.652 --> 00:21:01.078]  Whether it's cleaning your guns, or your own skin, or when you're out camping, this is the game changer.
[00:21:01.098 --> 00:21:06.224]  The entire family of Combat One is available exclusively at m4warriorstore.com.
[00:21:07.202 --> 00:21:10.545]  Just coming back from the river where I was using one of our water filtration straws.
[00:21:11.105 --> 00:21:13.427]  A certain device we sell here at Infantwarestore.com.
[00:21:14.188 --> 00:21:18.591]  And I had smacked my knuckle pretty hard the other day with my knife after cleaning one of the animals.
[00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:21.673]  So I'm going to use some Combat One Foam.
[00:21:22.034 --> 00:21:23.335]  Show you guys that we actually use it.
[00:21:23.775 --> 00:21:24.536]  How well it works.
[00:21:25.556 --> 00:21:27.698]  This wound has been open for about five days now.
[00:21:28.459 --> 00:21:30.000]  I just dipped it in and out of the river.
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.362]  So just to better, safe than sorry.
[00:21:41.843 --> 00:21:45.189]  Once I let that soak in, I'll wrap it up, field dress, and nice and clean again.
[00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:48.775]  And it certainly is coming to the rescue with Combat One.
[00:21:49.135 --> 00:21:50.257]  Born in America.
[00:21:50.718 --> 00:21:51.619]  Made in America.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:55.466]  And now distributed by InfoWars to America.
[00:22:01.018 --> 00:22:04.401]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:06.743]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:22:06.923 --> 00:22:15.310]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.913]  The key is to be aware of this attack and to fight back against it.
[00:22:19.073 --> 00:22:28.080]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-gmo organic super male
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:36.962]  Supermale vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:22:37.162 --> 00:22:39.083]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs.
[00:22:39.403 --> 00:22:46.985]  Supermale vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:53.534]  Super Mel Vitality by InfoWars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[00:22:53.834 --> 00:23:00.764]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com today to secure your Super Mel Vitality and other powerful products from InfoWars Life.
[00:23:04.813 --> 00:23:10.858]  Earlier this morning we had another example of the useless theatrics of the TSA at airports.
[00:23:11.418 --> 00:23:12.619]  Here again at JFK.
[00:23:12.699 --> 00:23:17.923]  Of course, this has happened once before where they allowed a lot of passengers to just walk through without being screened.
[00:23:18.503 --> 00:23:20.305]  Now we see this happening yet again today.
[00:23:20.865 --> 00:23:29.432]  Eleven passengers walked through a security lane without being screened at Kennedy Airport early Monday because the TSA left the area open and unattended, said law enforcement sources.
[00:23:29.952 --> 00:23:37.377]  The security camera captured a metal detector going off three times as travelers walked through the screening lane, and then they made it worse.
[00:23:38.098 --> 00:23:46.944]  The TSA tried to mitigate the situation by sending their own screeners throughout the terminal in violation of all the protocols, trying to find the people that they had inadvertently let through.
[00:23:47.644 --> 00:23:51.247]  Look folks, we understand that this is simply theatrics.
[00:23:51.827 --> 00:23:54.109]  This is there to try to make you feel safe.
[00:23:55.126 --> 00:23:57.388]  And people willingly give up their Fourth Amendment rights.
[00:23:57.748 --> 00:23:59.989]  We have seen the TSA do this before, haven't we?
[00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:07.535]  Remember the first Thanksgiving after they instituted their molesting protocols and their x-ray screeners?
[00:24:08.255 --> 00:24:11.137]  And we organized, InfoWars was a large part of that.
[00:24:11.217 --> 00:24:16.261]  There was a grassroots organization to try to opt out.
[00:24:16.361 --> 00:24:18.062]  Everybody was going to opt out on that Thanksgiving.
[00:24:18.482 --> 00:24:23.324]  They were concerned it was going to be a large opting out and that they were going to back everything up.
[00:24:23.404 --> 00:24:26.105]  So the TSA just turned off the scanners and let people walk through.
[00:24:27.126 --> 00:24:29.907]  On the busiest travel day of the year.
[00:24:30.862 --> 00:24:38.667]  Because they know, and you know as well as I do if you listen to this broadcast, that there is no security that is being conducted by the TSA.
[00:24:39.187 --> 00:24:40.788]  This is simply conditioning.
[00:24:41.328 --> 00:24:42.889]  Conditioning for a police state.
[00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:50.914]  Conditioning to get you to give up your liberty, to let them violate the Constitution, and to just go along with it.
[00:24:50.974 --> 00:24:54.056]  So we continue to see this happening yet again.
[00:24:54.557 --> 00:24:55.898]  Today it happened at JFK.
[00:24:56.858 --> 00:25:00.722]  Also, a new study has just come out, a report on Breitbart.
[00:25:00.862 --> 00:25:04.786]  Trump's border wall could save $64 billion over 10 years.
[00:25:04.806 --> 00:25:08.570]  We hear a lot of talk about the phenomenal cost and who is going to pay for it.
[00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:09.171]  Well, you know what?
[00:25:09.997 --> 00:25:13.699]  The American taxpayer would be saving more than this is going to cost.
[00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:16.742]  As I point out, this is a new study by the Center for Immigration Studies.
[00:25:17.302 --> 00:25:22.245]  They said an effective border wall could save taxpayers $64 billion over the next 10 years.
[00:25:22.826 --> 00:25:29.990]  This is information that was based on a study by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, NAS.
[00:25:30.371 --> 00:25:32.712]  And here's some of the bullet points on this.
[00:25:32.732 --> 00:25:39.837]  They say immigrants who come to America with modest levels of education create significantly more in cost for government than they pay in taxes.
[00:25:40.798 --> 00:25:55.627]  Let's understand, of course, it's not just that they're coming here without a significant education in order to be able to take a high-paying job or whatever, hopefully not at a fraction of the cost of people who are already here, but it's also the fact that we're having to pay for their education.
[00:25:55.667 --> 00:25:57.108]  That's why many of them are coming here.
[00:25:57.208 --> 00:26:06.334]  That's why many of them are coming here unaccompanied, as we hear from the unaccompanied minors coming in, even though that includes people up to the age of 31, coming here for a free education.
[00:26:06.894 --> 00:26:09.855]  In the language of their choice, at taxpayer expense.
[00:26:10.135 --> 00:26:12.696]  At the expense, probably, of your home.
[00:26:12.756 --> 00:26:15.117]  Because it's going to be your property taxes that are going to pay for that.
[00:26:15.717 --> 00:26:29.302]  But also remember that all these people, as they talk about the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, let's remember that those waves of immigration that came in through Ellis Island were done largely before FDR enacted his welfare state.
[00:26:29.962 --> 00:26:36.384]  You cannot have a welfare state and uncontrolled immigration with uncontrolled benefits for people.
[00:26:36.724 --> 00:26:50.969]  They also went on to say the NAS study showed that the average cost estimates combined with the educational levels of illegal border crossers shows a net fiscal drain of $74,722 per illegal crosser.
[00:26:51.469 --> 00:27:02.413]  They say if a border wall prevented 160,000 to 200,000 illegal crossings, and that's excluding their descendants, in the next 10 years it would be enough to pay for an estimated $12 to $15 billion cost of the wall.
[00:27:05.154 --> 00:27:09.219]  Meanwhile, we see some updates from sanctuary cities in Denver.
[00:27:10.241 --> 00:27:17.790]  One of two suspects in a Denver light rail robbery and murder was released from jail despite being flagged by ICE officials.
[00:27:18.575 --> 00:27:28.283]  They say a man suspected in a Denver murder this month was released from the county jail in December after ICE officials flagged him as an immigration enforcement priority.
[00:27:29.043 --> 00:27:31.185]  So now he is suspected of murder.
[00:27:31.685 --> 00:27:38.150]  Previously, he had been put in jail for multiple charges of possession of a weapon, vehicle theft, and a looting.
[00:27:38.891 --> 00:27:50.079]  But of course, since he also violated the law about crossing our borders, he was given immunity, essentially, for those charges of possessing a weapon, stealing a car, and eluding arrest.
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:52.361]  Now he is suspected of murder.
[00:27:52.421 --> 00:27:55.003]  They say the detainer was not honored, said ICE on Friday.
[00:27:55.343 --> 00:27:59.607]  He was released from jail on December 20, 2016, without notification to ICE.
[00:28:00.187 --> 00:28:01.888]  They released him on only $5,000 bail, even though he
[00:28:04.773 --> 00:28:08.154]  Perhaps had an armed robbery of a car and now he has killed somebody.
[00:28:08.414 --> 00:28:27.717]  They said due to his criminal history and his gang affiliation, he was an ICE Immigration Enforcement Priority, but not a priority for Denver because they want to give special priority rights to people no matter what else they do because they are illegal immigrants, foreign citizens here illegally.
[00:28:27.737 --> 00:28:29.978]  And we see the same thing here in Austin, Texas.
[00:28:30.658 --> 00:28:38.482]  Our newly elected sheriff here has said that she's only going to turn people over to ICE if they've committed three specific crimes.
[00:28:38.963 --> 00:28:48.268]  But then we saw just in the last week, she says she'll likely include additional criminal charges, you know, things that will involve children and elderly.
[00:28:49.201 --> 00:28:50.702]  And people that they will turn over.
[00:28:50.862 --> 00:28:51.522]  Isn't that nice?
[00:28:51.762 --> 00:28:58.886]  Now Americans who are elderly and American children enjoy some protection as well, according to the sheriff.
[00:28:58.966 --> 00:29:03.989]  Although there's still a lot of crimes that she determines she's not going to turn people over for.
[00:29:04.029 --> 00:29:04.609]  Violent crimes.
[00:29:04.649 --> 00:29:05.430]  They could rob a bank.
[00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:06.771]  She's not going to turn them over to ICE.
[00:29:07.191 --> 00:29:08.051]  They could steal your car.
[00:29:08.091 --> 00:29:09.252]  She's not going to turn them over to ICE.
[00:29:09.832 --> 00:29:12.954]  They could be involved in multiple drunk driving incidents.
[00:29:12.994 --> 00:29:14.055]  She's not going to turn them over to ICE.
[00:29:14.175 --> 00:29:14.435]  Why?
[00:29:15.319 --> 00:29:18.041]  Because they're illegal immigrants and they have special rights.
[00:29:18.442 --> 00:29:23.726]  Earlier this week, the detainer of a man accused of molesting a child was initially declined.
[00:29:23.806 --> 00:29:24.126]  Why?
[00:29:24.186 --> 00:29:30.832]  Because molesting a child was not on the list of the Austin Sheriff's things that she thought were serious.
[00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:36.911]  Yeah, that's not serious enough because it's trumped by the fact that you are here illegally.
[00:29:36.971 --> 00:29:42.393]  You're a foreign citizen so you get a pass on molesting children according to the sheriff here in Travis County.
[00:29:43.514 --> 00:29:52.557]  It was initially declined because he was charged with continual sexual abuse of a young child and that was not one of the four charges in the sheriff's policy.
[00:29:53.258 --> 00:29:53.738]  Isn't that great?
[00:29:54.625 --> 00:30:01.208]  Meanwhile, we saw this weekend that Chelsea Clinton took her two-year-old daughter, bragged about the fact it was the first demonstration she'd taken her daughter to.
[00:30:01.228 --> 00:30:04.229]  Of course, they were part of the rally in Times Square.
[00:30:04.249 --> 00:30:07.010]  Hashtag, I am a Muslim too.
[00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:09.531]  She's very excited about that.
[00:30:09.851 --> 00:30:11.212]  There was a loud call to prayer.
[00:30:11.232 --> 00:30:15.795]  There was also multiple shoutings of Allahu Akbar.
[00:30:15.835 --> 00:30:17.837]  In other words, our God is greater.
[00:30:17.857 --> 00:30:23.721]  Of course, we also heard that in Detroit with Farrakhan's rally in Detroit, but this was in New York.
[00:30:25.582 --> 00:30:31.247]  They keep telling us that we need to make as allies the moderate Muslims.
[00:30:31.367 --> 00:30:32.368]  We see that a U.S.
[00:30:32.448 --> 00:30:40.695]  mosque is holding a memorial for a jihadi assassin who murdered a Pakistani governor because he opposed the blasphemy law under Sharia.
[00:30:41.772 --> 00:30:43.793]  This is a report by Pamela Geller.
[00:30:43.813 --> 00:30:52.635]  She says, this is why we don't see more Muslim reformers, not only because they're targeted for death, but because they're celebrated by the so-called moderates here in America.
[00:30:53.075 --> 00:30:54.375]  This guy's name was Taseer.
[00:30:54.855 --> 00:31:01.317]  He dared to oppose the blasphemy law that Muslims in Pakistan have used for years now to persecute and to attack Christians.
[00:31:02.017 --> 00:31:08.020]  This is the Sharia behind the Charlie Hebdo slaughter and the multiple death attempts, she says, on her life.
[00:31:08.541 --> 00:31:13.463]  Now, this is a Maryland mosque that is mourning this murder.
[00:31:14.324 --> 00:31:15.645]  Here's the background on the story.
[00:31:16.045 --> 00:31:16.685]  There was a woman.
[00:31:17.706 --> 00:31:19.407]  Her name was Asia Beebe.
[00:31:19.727 --> 00:31:20.647]  She was a Christian woman.
[00:31:20.687 --> 00:31:28.652]  She was convicted of blaspheming the Prophet Muhammad after an argument erupted when she was bringing water to a female Muslim co-worker.
[00:31:29.557 --> 00:31:36.619]  Now this man who was murdered subsequently to that, the politician who was there, was speaking out in her defense.
[00:31:37.459 --> 00:31:46.261]  But the Islamic terrorist who murdered him and was subsequently sentenced to death and executed, it sparked protests by Islamic groups across Pakistan.
[00:31:46.301 --> 00:31:50.342]  More than 100,000 people attended the assassin's funeral.
[00:31:50.842 --> 00:31:56.724]  And I want to remind you that Pakistan is not one of the seven countries that we are doing extreme vetting for.
[00:31:57.728 --> 00:32:08.817]  Meanwhile, in New Jersey, an Islamic scholar there asked the crowd at the New Jersey mosque why they didn't come to the aid of the assassin after the arrest.
[00:32:09.438 --> 00:32:15.643]  And he says, Warrior Mumtaz Quadri kissed the noose in love for Prophet Muhammad.
[00:32:16.283 --> 00:32:18.766]  When Quadri was in jail for five years, what did we do?
[00:32:18.846 --> 00:32:20.648]  What effort did we make for his release?
[00:32:20.688 --> 00:32:27.456]  See, they just didn't do enough to protect the guy who killed someone who spoke out against Sharia law.
[00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:35.676]  That's why we need to have extreme vetting and that's why we need to take a look at the background of these individuals.
[00:32:36.457 --> 00:32:37.498]  Stay with us when we come back.
[00:32:37.558 --> 00:32:41.020]  Leanne McAdoo is going to take a look at Robert De Niro and vaccines.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:45.204]  Of course, after shutting down the documentary Vaxxed, he is now speaking out.
[00:32:45.584 --> 00:32:46.145]  We'll be right back.
[00:33:06.508 --> 00:33:16.037]  Everyone knows that InfoWars funds our operation by selling high quality products that we use and that everybody needs at very competitive affordable prices.
[00:33:17.022 --> 00:33:18.903]  That's why I get questions all the time over the years.
[00:33:18.923 --> 00:33:23.025]  Why don't you sell body armor at infowarestore.com?
[00:33:23.385 --> 00:33:25.726]  Or why don't you have sponsors that sell body armor?
[00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:26.746]  And it's simple.
[00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:32.429]  I will only promote and I will only sell the very, very best out there.
[00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:33.930]  And there's a nexus point.
[00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.791]  There's quality versus price.
[00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:38.732]  And those two points have to come together.
[00:33:39.332 --> 00:33:44.775]  National Defense Labs and its civilian subsidiary, Citizen Armor,
[00:33:45.595 --> 00:33:52.304]  has given InfoWars the exclusive on distributing to the American people.
[00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:55.913]  The true next generation in body armor.
[00:33:56.653 --> 00:34:03.715]  People are always saying, it's the 21st century, where are the silver jetpacks and where's Buck Rogers and the Skycars?
[00:34:04.415 --> 00:34:07.216]  Well, the globalists have basically suppressed a lot of those developments.
[00:34:07.236 --> 00:34:09.657]  They admit they want a post-industrial world.
[00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:13.678]  They call any technology that gets around their systems of control disruptive.
[00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:14.919]  Well, believe me,
[00:34:16.036 --> 00:34:18.677]  This is Disruptive to Tyrants Worldwide.
[00:34:19.297 --> 00:34:30.319]  Basically what we're bringing to the Info Wars team is a new line of dynamic, lightweight body armor.
[00:34:30.359 --> 00:34:31.959]  It's nanotube technology.
[00:34:32.559 --> 00:34:34.099]  It's created here in Texas.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.761]  It is lighter, more flexible, easier to wear, more comfortable, and stronger than anything else on the market.
[00:34:42.541 --> 00:34:44.882]  We've, uh, went out and did some testing.
[00:34:45.342 --> 00:34:47.663]  We originally found their claims, saw what they said.
[00:34:47.683 --> 00:34:54.166]  We were all kind of hesitant to believe that something so light, so flexible, um, could be so strong.
[00:34:54.386 --> 00:35:07.672]  So what we did is we went out, we used, um, different pistols, different calibers to test different pieces of the body armor to ensure that it was up to the high standards that we expect to carry here at the M4 War Store.
[00:35:08.052 --> 00:35:08.872]  Born in Texas.
[00:35:09.213 --> 00:35:10.173]  Made in America.
[00:35:10.373 --> 00:35:13.015]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:13.875]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:35:13.935 --> 00:35:14.875]  It's a quarter inch thick.
[00:35:15.236 --> 00:35:16.576]  I mean, it's got a 20-year warranty.
[00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:17.237]  It's waterproof.
[00:35:17.277 --> 00:35:17.737]  You can wear it.
[00:35:17.777 --> 00:35:18.337]  It's comfortable.
[00:35:18.397 --> 00:35:19.218]  I mean, it's not bulky.
[00:35:19.238 --> 00:35:21.539]  I mean, that's the biggest, I think, intrigue for you, Alex.
[00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:29.623]  The biggest thing for us is, unfortunately, we live in a society now where we need to be able to defend ourselves and our families at any time.
[00:35:30.323 --> 00:35:33.986]  And this is something that is so thin and so lightweight.
[00:35:34.006 --> 00:35:40.712]  You said when you talked to people that have been using this, actually testing it for years, people that currently have tested it for us, they didn't just say outstanding.
[00:35:40.732 --> 00:35:42.094]  What did they really say about it?
[00:35:42.194 --> 00:35:43.214]  No, this is through the roof.
[00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:46.177]  They want to know how do they get it, where do they find it.
[00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:54.865]  A lot of my law enforcement official buddies want to know the same thing because they're weighing, they're wearing these big heavy bulky vests that don't work as well.
[00:35:55.425 --> 00:36:00.429]  So, they're looking for something you can wear all day, 12 hours a day, in and out of a car.
[00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:07.954]  And 90, I mean, you can look up the numbers, 90 plus percent of fatalities with guns when they're used in a commission of crime, I think it's like 94, is pistols or shotguns.
[00:36:07.974 --> 00:36:09.636]  This stops that, unless it's a slug.
[00:36:09.656 --> 00:36:10.796]  I mean, that's amazing.
[00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:14.059]  So, they can wear this and only somebody with a rifle around is going to get through it.
[00:36:14.319 --> 00:36:20.183]  And soon, and we'll have it, if it's available to civilians, they're not sure, we're going to have the stuff that's, I mean, unstoppable.
[00:36:20.504 --> 00:36:24.486]  This deal is so insane, is so good, it makes my head spin.
[00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:28.689]  But I guess the first people to sell cars kind of had to give them away.
[00:36:28.709 --> 00:36:29.469]  People didn't believe it.
[00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:30.810]  Hell, I don't want that thing.
[00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:32.611]  I feed my horse hay.
[00:36:33.932 --> 00:36:36.033]  The backpack body armor is only $200.
[00:36:36.974 --> 00:36:41.156]  And we shot everything you can imagine on it.
[00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:48.434]  Again, fund the Info War, get the game changing nanotech tubes from Buck Rogers.
[00:36:48.834 --> 00:36:50.855]  It's a win-win.
[00:36:50.875 --> 00:36:50.855]  $200.
[00:36:51.455 --> 00:36:54.396]  Go check out all their different products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:36:54.476 --> 00:36:55.176]  It's amazing.
[00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:11.474]  Actor Robert De Niro just will not shut up about the link between vaccines and rising autism.
[00:37:11.734 --> 00:37:12.094]  And you know what?
[00:37:12.114 --> 00:37:13.335]  That's a very good thing indeed.
[00:37:13.395 --> 00:37:22.260]  A lot of people were really concerned that De Niro had been silenced after he was forced to remove the documentary Vaxxed from the Tribeca Film Festival last year.
[00:37:22.621 --> 00:37:29.425]  Now, Vaxxed is a documentary that accuses the CDC of covering up the link between vaccines and rising autism rates.
[00:37:29.665 --> 00:37:38.929]  The CDC, they've declared there is no connection between vaccines and autism, but Robert De Niro, who is not anti-vaccine, asks, who settled it?
[00:37:39.269 --> 00:37:40.210]  How is it settled?
[00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:45.672]  He gave a recent interview on Full Measure with Sheryl Atkinson, where he asked just that, where is the science?
[00:37:46.132 --> 00:37:46.792]  Who settled it?
[00:37:46.852 --> 00:37:47.693]  How was it settled?
[00:37:47.753 --> 00:37:50.954]  Where is the science, as Bobby Kennedy says?
[00:37:51.175 --> 00:37:52.035]  Where is the science?
[00:37:52.495 --> 00:37:57.778]  Here's what we have from all these studies, and here's what they have.
[00:37:58.618 --> 00:38:00.919]  And so it seems like something is not right.
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:07.142]  Are you behind the idea of forming some sort of scientific commission that would independently take a look at this?
[00:38:07.242 --> 00:38:08.243]  Sure, absolutely.
[00:38:09.904 --> 00:38:11.965]  An independent commission.
[00:38:12.005 --> 00:38:12.485]  It has to be.
[00:38:12.833 --> 00:38:21.701]  Now Robert De Niro said at the time that his family had never interfered with choosing a movie to be screened at the Tribeca Film Festival until Vax came along.
[00:38:21.781 --> 00:38:24.584]  He thought this was a very important film for people to see.
[00:38:24.944 --> 00:38:29.749]  De Niro is a parent with an autistic child and he said that he believes it is critical
[00:38:30.149 --> 00:38:35.571]  That all of the issues surrounding the causes of autism be openly discussed and examined.
[00:38:35.611 --> 00:38:37.691]  Of course, he was quickly silenced.
[00:38:37.992 --> 00:38:39.192]  The film had to be removed.
[00:38:39.512 --> 00:38:57.418]  Now, Vaxxed is directed and co-written by anti-vaccination activist Dr. Andrew Wakefield, and it exposes a huge scandal at the CDC where a longtime researcher, William Thompson, confessed in 2014 that he and colleagues committed gross fraud in a study of the MMR vaccine.
[00:38:57.938 --> 00:39:03.620]  Vaxxed accuses the CDC of covering up the link between MMR vaccines and rising autism rates.
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:08.201]  And they point out how this is particularly detrimental to the black community.
[00:39:08.261 --> 00:39:13.562]  Black males, for some reason, are even more susceptible to autism from the MMR vaccine.
[00:39:13.962 --> 00:39:21.885]  But they covered that up and messed a little bit with the data so that they could hide the correlation between vaccines and rising autism rates.
[00:39:21.945 --> 00:39:24.305]  And you'll find all of that in this movie, Vaxxed.
[00:39:24.345 --> 00:39:25.526]  It's a great documentary.
[00:39:25.546 --> 00:39:26.566]  I highly recommend you see it.
[00:39:26.986 --> 00:39:31.389]  So now Robert De Niro has joined forces with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:39:31.409 --> 00:39:36.092]  They're going to be questioning the safety of vaccinating children and pregnant women.
[00:39:36.132 --> 00:39:44.658]  They say it makes absolutely no sense that doctors are very adamant in telling pregnant women that they should avoid any seafood that could be laden with mercury.
[00:39:45.138 --> 00:39:55.605]  However, they highly recommend not one but two flu shots for pregnant women when it says right there on the vaccine insert that it hasn't been tested on pregnant women or on
[00:39:56.385 --> 00:39:59.628]  Children in utero, they have no idea how it's going to affect them.
[00:40:00.108 --> 00:40:03.951]  And indeed, as we've said, read the inserts, it contains mercury.
[00:40:04.031 --> 00:40:04.872]  So it makes no sense.
[00:40:04.892 --> 00:40:07.774]  They're going to be looking at this with an independent panel.
[00:40:08.415 --> 00:40:19.264]  Now, for her part, the investigative journalist that Robert De Niro was speaking with, Cheryl Atkinson, she's never shied away from reporting on this controversial topic or any other government and corporate malfeasance.
[00:40:19.764 --> 00:40:36.011]  Now in 2009, at the height of the swine flu hysteria, Atkison discovered that the CDC had secretly stopped counting cases of the swine flu, but they continued to push this idea, warning Americans about this unchecked spread.
[00:40:36.331 --> 00:40:37.391]  So this is unbelievable.
[00:40:37.431 --> 00:40:48.316]  So in a 2014 interview with John Rappaport, Atkison says that she found out through the FOIA efforts that before the CDC mysteriously stopped counting swine flu cases,
[00:40:48.836 --> 00:40:55.501]  They learned that almost none of the cases they had counted as swine flu were, in fact, swine flu.
[00:40:55.941 --> 00:40:58.884]  Indeed, they weren't even any kind of flu at all.
[00:40:59.144 --> 00:41:01.265]  And so that's why they stopped counting the cases.
[00:41:02.066 --> 00:41:09.731]  Now, one of her executives there at CBS said that this was the most original story he had seen on this whole swine flu epidemic.
[00:41:10.092 --> 00:41:11.933]  But the story was squelched.
[00:41:12.333 --> 00:41:14.515]  No broadcast ever wanted to touch it.
[00:41:15.035 --> 00:41:25.261]  CBS went on to air numerous stories pumping out this idea of an epidemic, but they never disclosed the fact that the CDC stopped reporting swine flu case numbers.
[00:41:25.781 --> 00:41:35.927]  And one can guess that it's because the overwhelming percentage of lab tests from likely swine flu patients shows that there was no sign of the swine flu or any other kind of flu.
[00:41:35.967 --> 00:41:39.789]  There was no epidemic, but they continued to pump out this
[00:41:40.229 --> 00:41:56.333]  Fake news and so this is the issue when you have people who are trying to come out and say that the science is not settled and in fact they have documentation of just how the cover-up happened and that this could be harming black males
[00:41:56.673 --> 00:42:04.217]  Specifically, but there is a correlation between rising autism rates at the rate is going back says that one in two could have autism by 2032.
[00:42:04.618 --> 00:42:06.039]  That is insane.
[00:42:06.379 --> 00:42:07.599]  So this is very important.
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:16.324]  And this is why it is amazing that we have a president who is not afraid to open up an independent investigation into this and to say, you know what?
[00:42:16.545 --> 00:42:19.927]  Let's find out why we do have such a high rate of autism.
[00:42:20.427 --> 00:42:23.929]  Now, Roger Stone was on the Alex Jones Show today, and he said just that.
[00:42:24.335 --> 00:42:27.436]  Trump's courage on the vaccine issue is extraordinary.
[00:42:27.456 --> 00:42:34.279]  I mean, the junk science industry is going crazy, calling him irresponsible and so on.
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:37.681]  The idea of getting Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:42:38.341 --> 00:42:53.588]  to head a commission to determine exactly what the problem is here and whether there has been a cover-up at CDC regarding data involving the safety of vaccines is brilliant because it proves this is not some partisan
[00:42:54.469 --> 00:43:02.592]  Right-wing conspiracy, this is a legitimate health problem.
[00:43:03.692 --> 00:43:14.936]  At the heart, the foundation of media, of press, the same heart and foundation of science, is one single idea.
[00:43:16.217 --> 00:43:20.178]  We must never stop asking questions.
[00:43:21.784 --> 00:43:24.126]  If we do, science is dead.
[00:43:25.288 --> 00:43:30.212]  If science believes it has the only truth, there will never be another Einstein.
[00:43:30.513 --> 00:43:33.055]  There will never be another breakthrough event.
[00:43:34.637 --> 00:43:44.947]  And if journalists stop asking the important questions, then there will never be the dream of the United States of America.
[00:43:50.529 --> 00:43:51.730]  Rob Dew with Infowars.com.
[00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:59.195]  We are on location in our nation's capital, Washington, D.C., right across the street from the National Press Club, where today Robert Kennedy Jr.
[00:43:59.435 --> 00:44:14.766]  and Robert De Niro had a joint press conference, along with several others, talking about a $100,000 bounty to give to any journalist or any member of the public who has a documented study that proves that mercury is safe to inject into small babies.
[00:44:15.146 --> 00:44:17.807]  And right here with me, one of the guys up on the stage was Dale Bigtree.
[00:44:17.847 --> 00:44:19.487]  He's the producer of Vaxxed.
[00:44:19.507 --> 00:44:20.608]  You may have seen that documentary.
[00:44:20.628 --> 00:44:22.028]  There's a big promotion of Vaxxed.
[00:44:22.048 --> 00:44:28.970]  I've got to say, the way you guys promote, almost every day I see something new on my Twitter feed or Facebook feed of what you guys are doing.
[00:44:29.391 --> 00:44:33.232]  So, tell us how you got involved in Vaxxed and what brought you to the event today.
[00:44:33.572 --> 00:44:37.013]  I mean, I was a producer on the daytime talk show, The Doctors, for six years.
[00:44:37.093 --> 00:44:39.834]  So, I was celebrating the best that medicine has to offer.
[00:44:39.874 --> 00:44:42.595]  Best doctors, surgeries, you know, new technologies.
[00:44:43.275 --> 00:44:50.284]  And then I got an informant that told me about the whistleblower, Dr. William Thompson, at the Centers for Disease Control.
[00:44:50.304 --> 00:44:55.971]  He said in two weeks, this guy's going to come forward and say that vaccines are causing autism and the CDC's covered it up.
[00:44:56.051 --> 00:45:00.877]  I mean, obviously that's the biggest medical story in my lifetime.
[00:45:01.597 --> 00:45:02.338]  You think it would be?
[00:45:02.418 --> 00:45:03.319]  Yeah, you would think it would be.
[00:45:03.339 --> 00:45:05.641]  And you would think a show like The Doctors would want to do it.
[00:45:05.701 --> 00:45:08.403]  But that's not the way TV works.
[00:45:08.603 --> 00:45:11.726]  You're not sort of shackled by the same things that we are in television.
[00:45:12.046 --> 00:45:14.448]  You don't have those pharmaceutical ads every commercial break.
[00:45:14.488 --> 00:45:17.571]  They're actually paying your salary and telling you what you can and cannot say.
[00:45:18.372 --> 00:45:20.573]  And so, obviously, I wasn't able to cover that story.
[00:45:20.593 --> 00:45:21.835]  And what was shocking was
[00:45:22.455 --> 00:45:38.400]  You know, two weeks later the story did come out online, social media went crazy, but not a single newspaper, not a single, you know, mainstream news organization covered the story of a top scientist at the CDC saying they were committing scientific fraud on vaccines, on vaccine safety studies.
[00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:44.502]  So that's when I really started to realize there's something bigger going on here.
[00:45:44.562 --> 00:45:51.764]  Our media somehow is entrenched with the pharmaceutical industry and this is a government agency, the CDC is wound up in this.
[00:45:52.544 --> 00:46:06.269]  My curiosity got the best of me, and so I started investigating, you know, where's this story coming from that tracked me into Andy Wakefield, who's, you know, probably the most reviled doctor, I think, maybe in the world.
[00:46:06.389 --> 00:46:11.170]  They use the word discredited every time they say, Andrew Wakefield, the discredited doctor.
[00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:13.251]  It's always discredited, discredited.
[00:46:13.671 --> 00:46:15.091]  And they never want to walk that back.
[00:46:15.211 --> 00:46:20.173]  But continue on your story, and then I want you to get to that about how he's really not discredited, how that itself is a lie.
[00:46:20.473 --> 00:46:22.135]  Yeah, I mean, so we can go right there.
[00:46:22.155 --> 00:46:28.420]  I mean, obviously, what I was saying, you know, I told you is that in order to do this story, I mean, the whistleblower story, I wanted a piece of it.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:29.380]  No one was touching it.
[00:46:29.821 --> 00:46:38.728]  But Andy Wakefield was the one with the recordings of Thompson on phone calls and had really been doing the work and had been working on this film for about a year when I ran into him.
[00:46:39.348 --> 00:46:41.069]  Um, but I had to investigate Andy Wakefield.
[00:46:41.089 --> 00:46:43.930]  I mean, here I was about to leave a really cushy job in television.
[00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:47.592]  You know, I'm an Emmy Award winning producer and align myself with Andy Wakefield.
[00:46:47.652 --> 00:46:48.812]  It's a scary journey.
[00:46:49.412 --> 00:46:54.254]  Uh, but as you start investigating the Wakefield story, you realize even this has issues to it.
[00:46:54.274 --> 00:46:58.596]  You know, even this is, is cloaked in all sorts of, you know, really baloney.
[00:47:02.978 --> 00:47:07.720]  Alex Jones here with a very important news update to anybody out there that wants to be prepared.
[00:47:08.424 --> 00:47:10.005]  But it goes beyond being prepared.
[00:47:10.405 --> 00:47:15.406]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen iodine or we will die.
[00:47:15.746 --> 00:47:21.188]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy and that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:28.190]  And from my research and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over and over and over again.
[00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:29.971]  It's as important as vitamin C.
[00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:32.772]  If you don't get iodine, you die.
[00:47:33.093 --> 00:47:36.054]  But most people are just deficient, so they're low energy, they're sick.
[00:47:36.495 --> 00:47:40.117]  You've got to have iodine in your body so that your body can produce the hormones you need.
[00:47:40.297 --> 00:47:42.859]  It is the base to so many things.
[00:47:42.899 --> 00:47:55.267]  And since I got into iodine four years ago, we've helped change the entire paradigm by developing and bringing to the public deep earth crystals from 7,000 to 12,000 feet of the purest iodine available.
[00:47:55.467 --> 00:48:00.588]  Other iodine comes from the ocean or from other byproducts of chemical facilities and is tainted.
[00:48:00.708 --> 00:48:02.048]  It's bound.
[00:48:02.328 --> 00:48:03.329]  It's not absorbable.
[00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:08.310]  I tried it and I had incredible effects even with dirty iodine because the body needs it.
[00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.431]  When you don't have iodine, it absorbs the chlorine, the fluoride, and all these other bad halogens.
[00:48:13.911 --> 00:48:18.812]  Do yourself and your family a favor and check out the importance of iodine for yourself.
[00:48:18.892 --> 00:48:20.052]  I think you're going to be blown away.
[00:48:20.212 --> 00:48:20.912]  And whatever you do,
[00:48:21.272 --> 00:48:25.115]  Support the broadcast and get a bottle of Survival Shield Nascent Iodine X2.
[00:48:25.315 --> 00:48:30.299]  Also, consult your physician because if you've been deficient in it or have other issues, it can have some dramatic effects.
[00:48:30.479 --> 00:48:34.062]  As for me and most folks I talk to, it's been a game changer in the positive column.
[00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:37.324]  But still, consult your physician because iodine is no joke.
[00:48:37.385 --> 00:48:45.651]  It's a key building block of the body and if you haven't had it for a long time and suddenly have it, some folks say they've experienced things like a detoxing effect and things like that.
[00:48:45.811 --> 00:48:48.412]  You've got to have vitamin C. You've got to have iodine to live.
[00:48:48.432 --> 00:48:49.472]  You've got to have water to live.
[00:48:49.812 --> 00:48:50.493]  Iodine is key.
[00:48:50.553 --> 00:48:51.153]  You must have it.
[00:48:51.513 --> 00:48:59.055]  But consult your physician first before you get powerful survival shield nascent iodine, X2, at Infowarslife.com or call toll free.
[00:48:59.075 --> 00:48:59.956]  We can answer your questions.
[00:48:59.976 --> 00:49:00.016]  888-253-3139.
[00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:09.752]  There's been a debate about when to take the president seriously.
[00:49:09.832 --> 00:49:13.874]  He recently tweeted that the press was the enemy of the American people.
[00:49:14.294 --> 00:49:15.855]  Should we take that seriously from him?
[00:49:16.455 --> 00:49:18.256]  Well, I think you should take it seriously.
[00:49:18.276 --> 00:49:22.558]  A fundamental part of that new world order was a free press.
[00:49:23.358 --> 00:49:30.862]  If you want to preserve democracy as we know it, you have to have a free and many times adversarial press.
[00:49:30.882 --> 00:49:33.884]  And without it, I'm afraid that we would lose
[00:49:35.204 --> 00:49:38.025]  So much of our individual liberties over time.
[00:49:38.125 --> 00:49:39.805]  That's how dictators get started.
[00:49:40.366 --> 00:49:43.026]  We're talking establishment versus Trump.
[00:49:43.166 --> 00:49:44.627]  Trump considered to be an outsider.
[00:49:45.627 --> 00:49:48.068]  The establishment doesn't want any part of Trump.
[00:49:48.188 --> 00:49:52.389]  They don't want him to succeed and I would throw some Republicans in that as well.
[00:49:52.809 --> 00:49:54.930]  It's just the way Washington works.
[00:49:55.370 --> 00:50:16.501]  Arizona Senator John McCain, groom of the stool for the New World Order, traveled to Munich, Germany for the annual Munich Security Conference to plead with hordes of globalists hanging on to their neo-feudalist dream, with McCain asking that his fellow American lapdogs not be counted out of the New World Order paradigm.
[00:50:16.662 --> 00:50:20.744]  Many of our peoples, including in my own country, are giving up on the West.
[00:50:21.564 --> 00:50:24.706]  That they see it as a bad deal that we may be better off without.
[00:50:25.416 --> 00:50:33.641]  And that while Western nations still have the power to maintain our world order, it's unclear whether we have the will.
[00:50:34.482 --> 00:50:41.786]  I know there is profound concern across Europe and the world that America is laying down the mantle of global leadership.
[00:50:42.267 --> 00:50:47.510]  I can only speak for myself, but I do not believe that that is the message you will hear.
[00:50:48.294 --> 00:50:52.657]  From all of the American leaders who cared enough to travel here to Munich this weekend.
[00:50:53.018 --> 00:50:57.261]  That's not the message you heard today from Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis.
[00:50:57.401 --> 00:51:01.584]  That's not the message you will hear from Vice President Mike Pence.
[00:51:01.644 --> 00:51:06.368]  That's not the message you will hear from Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly.
[00:51:06.828 --> 00:51:14.074]  And that is certainly not the message you will hear tomorrow from our bipartisan congressional delegation.
[00:51:14.901 --> 00:51:21.662]  Make no mistake, my friends, these are dangerous times, but you should not count America out.
[00:51:25.363 --> 00:51:29.704]  Vice President Mike Pence had far more of a nationalist vision.
[00:51:30.504 --> 00:51:35.946]  We must be strong in our conviction that our cause is just, and that our way of life is worth defending.
[00:51:36.966 --> 00:51:42.487]  If we lose the will to do our part to defend ourselves, we jeopardize our shared heritage of freedom.
[00:51:43.877 --> 00:51:48.360]  Under President Trump's leadership, I can assure you, the United States will be strong.
[00:51:49.361 --> 00:51:50.582]  Stronger than ever before.
[00:51:51.282 --> 00:51:54.505]  Waiting in the wings was German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
[00:51:54.685 --> 00:52:08.394]  Her popularity running on fumes as her own hubris couldn't hide the fact that as RT reports, almost 64% of Germans don't wish to see Angela Merkel re-elected as Chancellor.
[00:52:08.574 --> 00:52:10.756]  A poll conducted by YouGov has found.
[00:52:10.996 --> 00:52:18.741]  Meanwhile, the Social Democrats are shooting ahead in the polls, despite predictions that their popularity was on the wane.
[00:52:18.881 --> 00:52:25.926]  The poll published on Monday shows that of the two-thirds of Germans dissatisfied with Merkel, 42% strongly want her out.
[00:52:27.907 --> 00:52:32.711]  While 22% said it was probably a good idea to elect a new leader.
[00:52:32.811 --> 00:52:40.977]  Conversely, 19% said it was probably best to stick with her to avoid a change in leadership in the foreseeable future.
[00:52:41.077 --> 00:52:45.941]  While only 8% strongly wanted to see her reelected as Chancellor.
[00:52:45.981 --> 00:52:50.606]  What we have today is a world where there is no fixed international global order.
[00:52:51.107 --> 00:52:56.672]  And in spite of the Cold War, the relationship with Russia is as yet, I say this from a European perspective, not as it should be.
[00:53:02.819 --> 00:53:10.503]  Munich served as a funeral for the New World Order, a memorial for the hell on earth that nearly dominated the United States of America.
[00:53:10.823 --> 00:53:20.868]  Of course, globalism will rise yet again, but never forget, it is our duty as Americans to identify its malevolent presence at every opportunity.
[00:53:21.048 --> 00:53:22.969]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[00:53:29.069 --> 00:53:30.610]  Go ahead.
[00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:32.190]  Should I let him have a little bit more?
[00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:33.350]  What do you think, Peter?
[00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:35.591]  Peter, should I let him have a little bit more?
[00:53:35.771 --> 00:53:36.231]  Sit down.
[00:53:36.571 --> 00:53:36.891]  Sit down.
[00:53:37.011 --> 00:53:38.152]  We'll get it.
[00:53:38.172 --> 00:53:44.134]  Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir... I'm changing it from fake news, though.
[00:53:44.634 --> 00:53:46.334]  Doesn't that under... Very fake news.
[00:53:46.394 --> 00:53:47.175]  I know, but aren't you...
[00:54:08.561 --> 00:54:18.567]  So, I wake up every morning, I do my usual, I get ready to go out and save the world for my social justice warrior work.
[00:54:34.177 --> 00:54:36.358]  So I get out and I'm ready to go save the world.
[00:54:43.263 --> 00:54:57.682]  I have my Trump sign, my love Trump's hate sign, and I'm just going to go out and I'm going to protest until that bigoted Hitler embodiment gets taken from the White House.
[00:55:03.086 --> 00:55:17.891]  So I was going about my day, walking down the street, minding my own business, thinking about feminist thoughts, when all of the sudden, in my Facebook feed, I see this post!
[00:55:18.991 --> 00:55:26.054]  I mean, who does this cisgendered white male think he is that he can say these things?
[00:55:30.584 --> 00:55:32.586]  How can he say that stuff?
[00:55:33.366 --> 00:55:34.728]  It's just not right!
[00:55:35.388 --> 00:55:37.851]  And I will not stop protesting!
[00:55:38.391 --> 00:55:40.233]  No Trump!
[00:55:40.273 --> 00:55:40.774]  No KKK!
[00:55:40.794 --> 00:55:41.895]  No Fascist USA!
[00:55:42.235 --> 00:55:43.517]  No Trump!
[00:55:45.178 --> 00:55:46.339]  You're all racists!
[00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:47.260]  Racists!
[00:55:48.931 --> 00:55:55.938]  Until every cisgender male acknowledges that there are multiple sexualities!
[00:55:55.958 --> 00:56:00.603]  There's infant numbers of genders and infant numbers of sexualities!
[00:56:00.904 --> 00:56:01.464]  Okay?
[00:56:01.484 --> 00:56:04.527]  I can't handle that!
[00:56:06.411 --> 00:56:11.532]  So I'm walking down the street, minding my own business, okay?
[00:56:11.872 --> 00:56:21.274]  All I'm trying to do is protest and show the vehicles going by that Trump is not wanted by women in America.
[00:56:22.054 --> 00:56:27.475]  And then all of a sudden this, like, media press guy comes up and starts trying to videotape me.
[00:56:27.495 --> 00:56:28.996]  No Trump!
[00:56:29.056 --> 00:56:29.676]  No KKK!
[00:56:29.716 --> 00:56:30.696]  No fascist USA!
[00:56:30.716 --> 00:56:31.196]  No Trump!
[00:56:31.236 --> 00:56:33.037]  Get the f*** out of my face!
[00:56:35.967 --> 00:56:38.488]  What's wrong with you?
[00:56:38.508 --> 00:56:44.732]  Seriously, what right do they have to come put a camera in my safe space?
[00:56:45.452 --> 00:56:48.414]  What the hell is wrong with this country?
[00:56:49.074 --> 00:56:49.895]  That's it!
[00:56:50.435 --> 00:56:52.176]  I am organizing a rally!
[00:57:11.109 --> 00:57:13.013]  Bing bing bong bong bing bing bing.
[00:57:19.653 --> 00:57:27.036]  My name's Rainbow Snatch, and I am a trans-binary, multi-dimensional being, okay?
[00:57:27.116 --> 00:57:29.637]  You need to respect my gender identity.
[00:57:30.097 --> 00:57:39.201]  Aside from that, why do we have a xenophobic, racist, lunatic in the White House?
[00:57:39.801 --> 00:57:40.362]  Okay?
[00:57:44.163 --> 00:57:45.184]  Seriously, people?
[00:57:46.274 --> 00:58:04.029]  You know, when I think about this, that this man is literally insane, and nobody seems to care... We can't have a lunatic in the White House, people!
[00:58:04.770 --> 00:58:05.931]  What's wrong with you?
[00:58:07.165 --> 00:58:10.246]  We needed Hillary Clinton, okay?
[00:58:10.786 --> 00:58:12.586]  Hillary freaking Clinton!
[00:58:13.147 --> 00:58:14.987]  You guys try to say she's a psycho!
[00:58:15.667 --> 00:58:16.908]  Leave her alone!
[00:58:17.908 --> 00:58:20.709]  We cannot have a lunatic in the White House!
[00:58:21.269 --> 00:58:30.671]  He's a racist, xenophobic, bigot, misogynist man that wants to grieve women by the freaking pussies!
[00:58:32.312 --> 00:58:33.312]  We cannot have this.
[00:58:39.434 --> 00:58:45.580]  So the Democrats and Liberals need to come together and get him out of the White House.
[00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:48.022]  He needs to be impeached!
[00:58:50.184 --> 00:58:50.605]  Okay?
[00:58:51.545 --> 00:58:58.312]  This is Rainbow Dash here and I've infiltrated InfoWars to tell you this message!
[00:59:04.127 --> 00:59:09.932]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries in the area of health.
[00:59:10.393 --> 00:59:20.121]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:59:20.442 --> 00:59:24.185]  DNA Force is one of the most expensive formulas to produce.
[00:59:24.746 --> 00:59:27.588]  Some of the ingredients in DNA Force are $12,000 a kilogram.
[00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:36.017]  We are using the coveted, patented, only American source of PQQ, CoQ10, and more.
